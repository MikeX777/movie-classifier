1
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:23,815
Holy crap!

2
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:27,895
Holy crap!

3
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:34,815
- Holy shit, what are you doing?
- It's good luck.

4
00:00:34,855 --> 00:00:39,656
Keep still, it bothers me.
What a hurry! I want to eat.

5
00:00:39,696 --> 00:00:43,695
In a while
a TV show starts.

6
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:49,296
They do proton launches,
armor-piercing missiles... Goldrake!

7
00:00:49,335 --> 00:00:51,816
"Mortacci tui!"

8
00:00:51,856 --> 00:00:54,696
You always catch me
The eye on the far right!

9
00:00:54,736 --> 00:00:59,456
Here's what kind of family I got:
An unfortunate wife leaves....

10
00:00:59,496 --> 00:01:03,536
...and leaves me with a brother-in-law
...a treacherous bread-eater!

11
00:01:03,577 --> 00:01:07,537
Dad, I told you
he had a brother who was a creep.

12
00:01:07,576 --> 00:01:12,016
- Nice gratitude! And me
I'm your mother. - As a mother?!

13
00:01:12,057 --> 00:01:16,057
You know I stayed
because I disapprove of my sister.

14
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:20,577
- The truth is, you eat and drink here.
- Am I an asshole? - Guess.

15
00:01:21,316 --> 00:01:23,557
- Go ahead and open it up.
- It's the phone.

16
00:01:23,597 --> 00:01:27,337
- Then I'll go.
- Come on!

17
00:01:27,377 --> 00:01:30,697
- I'll get it.
- Go answer it!

18
00:01:30,737 --> 00:01:34,617
Damn you!
Why don't you kill yourselves?

19
00:01:37,178 --> 00:01:40,657
"Hallo?"
This is Presta Laricchiuta residence.

20
00:01:40,697 --> 00:01:44,698
- I am Nicolino.
- How are you? I didn't think it was you.

21
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:49,537
- Everyone okay at home? - Sure.
- How's my appointment going?

22
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:53,657
- Walk. - Let's stop her,
she's been walking for three years.

23
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:58,057
- Not to shorten the time...
- I'm sending Angela to study at your place.

24
00:01:58,098 --> 00:02:03,578
Whatever, but there's only one
quarter until the end of school.

25
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:08,258
I am sure that in a healthy
healthy environment like yours...

26
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:14,298
...Angela, at least in these 3 months,
will find the will to study.

27
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:18,098
Here in Rome, you get very distracted.
So?

28
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,658
- All right. - I was sure of it.
Thank you. Shall I get it started right away?

29
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:26,259
- Yes. - I would like to say hello
your wife. - What wife?

30
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:30,779
As in "which wife"?
Your second wife, Amalia.

31
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:34,818
My brother-in-law's wife's sister
brother-in-law, we are almost related.

32
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:39,619
I call her,
I don't know which wing of the house she's in.

33
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:44,059
It's in the right wing, there it is.
Amalia, love?

34
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,259
There is Nicolino who wants to say hello.

35
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:51,539
- Are you crazy? - It's the one
from the ministry, my relative.

36
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:55,620
- Say you are Amalia. - But there isn't.
- You do a castrato voice.

37
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:59,460
Here she is, Nicolino,
she was doing her chores.

38
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,220
- How are you doing, Commander?
- Fine.

39
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,660
- How are you?
- I'm fine, thanks.

40
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,580
- Angela is coming in tomorrow.
- I'm glad. - Is that a bother?

41
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,260
- No disturbance.
- What happened to your voice?

42
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,620
I have ups and
lows, loose strings.

43
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,780
- Your mother's double bass!
- Take care, my dear.

44
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:30,140
- Greetings to all. - Thanks a lot
and regards to the lady. "Bye- bye."

45
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:34,461
- Dad, who is this Angela?
- A relative, you don't know her.

46
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,341
In 1754, your great-grandfather Oronzo
emigrated to America...

47
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:42,821
...and met Aunt Imelda,
whom he married in Canada.

48
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,981
- Now she tells you the whole Bible.
- I mean, she's a relative of ours.

49
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:50,821
You will sleep in the closet
upstairs and she'll sleep in your room.

50
00:05:08,663 --> 00:05:11,704
We missed
this pain in the ass Angela!

51
00:05:11,743 --> 00:05:15,183
If it looks like Nicolino
who knows what kind of scorpion fish he will be.

52
00:05:15,223 --> 00:05:19,104
But if she looks like mom...
She's a good mom!

53
00:05:19,143 --> 00:05:21,944
It has two "canopies"
that drive me crazy.

54
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:29,143
Not at all! What do I care?
I'm going to Fedora anyway.

55
00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:33,744
That one's waiting for me...
Four, five... eight!

56
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:40,344
Ah! But where... Damn you!
Ah! The heel!

57
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:58,065
"Bailate, bailate!"

58
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:01,345
"Olé, guapa!"

59
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:10,025
"What's wrong with that guy tonight?"

60
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:15,745
- What do you have?
- We missed Angela, my cousin.

61
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:17,945
She may be a skank!

62
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,385
Yes, I wish!

63
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:30,666
- When will you take me to your house?
- I could use it, love.

64
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:34,705
Shall I tell you again
the history of my family?

65
00:06:34,745 --> 00:06:37,266
My son was a happy orphan,

66
00:06:37,306 --> 00:06:41,146
then I married that wretch
Amalia and he got jealous.

67
00:06:41,186 --> 00:06:45,906
Amalia ran away and was offended,
plus my brother-in-law is at our house.

68
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:49,746
If I bring you along,
he'll be pissed off for good.

69
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:54,587
- You are the father and he is the son.
- But you are not the Holy Spirit.

70
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:59,306
Begin! Tac, tac, tac. Who is
the character of the week?

71
00:06:59,346 --> 00:07:02,146
Tac, tac, tac.

72
00:07:03,747 --> 00:07:07,827
- Tarzan! - Do you like it?
- Sure. I'm your Jane!

73
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:11,867
- Go to the forest, come on!
- Yes, right away...

74
00:07:14,787 --> 00:07:19,267
- Tarzan, there's a crocodile!
- Do you want to kill my "Jenny"?

75
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:24,347
- Help!
- I'm diving into the sea! Ahh!

76
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:28,427
I broke my knee.
Give me your belly, you crocodile!

77
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:34,348
Tisquarcio. Blood of crocodile,
I become mandrill. Here is the monkey.

78
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:39,148
- What are you doing, crocodile?
- Yeah, that's right. - You want to get away from me?

79
00:07:39,187 --> 00:07:43,187
Do you want to get on top of me?
No, I'm going to get on top of you!

80
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:46,668
You wretch,
you want to kill Jenny?

81
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:52,548
I'll give you 40 stabs,
57 stabs, 84 stabs!

82
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:58,348
- Yes, like that! - 91... How many
stab wounds? I want to give one.

83
00:07:58,388 --> 00:08:02,868
One and good. What do I care?
Here, crocodile!

84
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:13,188
The gentlemen travelers who have
taken the train to Cerignola...

85
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:17,628
...please
to get it back on the first track.

86
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:24,069
Travelers coming from Rome
have a connection...

87
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:29,069
- Here she is! - My niece is a
student, that's a nun.

88
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,949
I know him
a nun who is always studying.

89
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:35,909
- Nicolino is a Christian Democrat. - What the
fuck... - Amen. - Peace and good.

90
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:40,149
If he were a Republican, would his daughter
Would she dress in ivy leaves?

91
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:46,149
- Is the mail coming? - Here it is.
We finished a hand of tresette.

92
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:50,710
- Come on, unload. - Now they put
the mail inside the suitcases?

93
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,269
No, general, this is my stuff.

94
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:57,509
During the trip, the young lady
peeled us off at tresette.

95
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:02,870
- This must be it. - "Mortacci,
how good it is"! - That's what I say.

96
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,470
- Hi, you're Pasquale, right?
- "Bella mia"!

97
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:11,190
- No, Uncle Pasquale is me.
- Oh, sorry. - "Bella di zio tuo"!

98
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,031
- You don't look like a priest,
You look like a chubby kid. - Not so much.

99
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:19,670
- "Asshole." - Did you see that?
- What silhouettes! Uh, Bartolomeo!

100
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:21,751
Miss, forget the bird.

101
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:26,030
I traveled with him to
not leave him alone in the trunk.

102
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,430
- Is it a crow?
- It's an Indian blackbird and it can talk.

103
00:09:30,471 --> 00:09:33,231
- Hello, bitches.
- He recognized us.

104
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:35,551
Prof. Cacioppo arrives.

105
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,791
Good morning, guys!

106
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:52,511
- Was it you?
- No, it was him. - But I...

107
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:56,531
- Did you do that?
- Sorry, Dad... - Dad, my ass!

108
00:09:56,572 --> 00:10:01,871
- Go to your places, assholes!
You come here. - Me? - Come here.

109
00:10:02,391 --> 00:10:04,552
We're even.

110
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:10,592
Hi, guys!

111
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:12,712
Good, good, sit.

112
00:10:12,752 --> 00:10:16,472
This young lady
is Angela Mancinelli.

113
00:10:16,512 --> 00:10:20,312
She is my niece and your
classmate for this quarter.

114
00:10:21,852 --> 00:10:25,732
Thank you. All right, all right, thank you.

115
00:10:27,152 --> 00:10:30,632
Enough. We are not
the Sanremo Festival!

116
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,793
Sit here.

117
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:36,712
I wanted to tell you something else:
I am very well known...

118
00:10:36,753 --> 00:10:41,993
- You're a stunner. Welcome.
- What's your name? - Irma.

119
00:10:42,032 --> 00:10:46,952
I'm known for my calmness,
but if I get pissed, holy shit...

120
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:50,593
...I will break you
and I'll break your heads, got it?

121
00:10:51,353 --> 00:10:54,993
Was it you?
Damned debauches!

122
00:10:55,033 --> 00:11:01,793
Good thing that today
you didn't pull your usual prank today.

123
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:06,593
- They did, professor.
- Mr. Principal, are you here? - Yes.

124
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:10,873
Next time, come on time,
so these exchanges don't happen.

125
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:14,794
I have been...

126
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:20,194
#♪ A little cold ♪ #

127
00:11:20,234 --> 00:11:24,834
# But I got the shot! #

128
00:11:25,474 --> 00:11:27,874
If you get pissed, sing along, professor.

129
00:11:27,914 --> 00:11:30,314
- Goodbye.
- Sorry.

130
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:33,995
Why are you laughing?! Quiet!

131
00:11:34,034 --> 00:11:37,634
I don't want to
to hear a "fly"!

132
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:44,395
This is cappuccino time.
Now comes Salvatore.

133
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:46,394
Well!

134
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:55,115
- A...me... rica...
- We, uh... Him? Me?

135
00:11:55,154 --> 00:11:57,435
Both.

136
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:04,755
Come here, you. Give me the rubber band.
Open your hands... Open your hands!

137
00:12:05,515 --> 00:12:07,795
- Ouch!
- Go to the post.

138
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:16,555
Shut up... that...
I said zi... shut up that he...

139
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:18,635
"What, you want to fuck me?"

140
00:12:22,435 --> 00:12:24,836
Mom!

141
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:29,796
Those who are pre--prepared, come.

142
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:33,395
- Professor!
- You! Mi... miracle!

143
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:38,156
What a miracle! I just wanted to say
that yesterday Gino saw a UFO.

144
00:12:38,196 --> 00:12:42,036
- Oh, yeah? How was it?
- How was it, Gino?

145
00:12:42,076 --> 00:12:44,996
Nice, big, round.

146
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:49,116
- Was he fe... fe... fe...
- Was he dumb? - No, was he still?

147
00:12:49,157 --> 00:12:53,277
- Yes, then he sent a beam
of blue light. - And what a light it was!

148
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:58,037
Beautiful, and where did you see it?

149
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:02,157
- Towards the sea.
- They always fool him with UFOs.

150
00:13:02,196 --> 00:13:06,157
- The professor is a fixer.
- They're nice kids.

151
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:10,957
- Your cousin Marco is cute, isn't he?
- The others aren't bad either.

152
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:14,637
He is the cutest,
and I'm his girlfriend.

153
00:13:14,677 --> 00:13:19,077
- Why don't you stay in the same
desk? - He doesn't know yet.

154
00:13:19,117 --> 00:13:25,797
Forget about
crap like interrogation.

155
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:29,878
I want to explain the ga... ga...

156
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:34,037
- The chickens?
- The galaxies!

157
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:38,918
# They are called galaxies
those systems in space. #

158
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:41,198
# Thousand armies of stars. #

159
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:48,958
# A hundred billion in a mass
Of gas and dust too!" #

160
00:13:48,998 --> 00:13:52,398
Bravo! Bravo!

161
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:03,639
- Savior!
- Ah!

162
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:07,798
Oh, I'm so sorry!
Now come on up.

163
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,959
- I hurt myself. - Tell me what the
the fuck you were doing at the door.

164
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:16,479
I used to tune it with the choirboy
because it dropped half a tone.

165
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,279
- I have a sensitive ear. - How come
How come? Did you do Santa Cecilia?

166
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:26,439
You're handsome, you're sweet, I like you.
What a great tie, it's striped.

167
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:30,159
Let's go to the light,
I am a presbyterian principal.

168
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:34,480
- Pure! - I'll get my glasses.
It's a nice tie.

169
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:41,040
- Look at that. It has crooked lines,
Now we'll straighten them. - Help!

170
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,480
Don't react! I am the principal
and you are the janitor, you are a subordinate.

171
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,879
- If you react, I'll kill you.
- Sure you will. - Look at that.

172
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,440
- Salvatore, maybe they rang
at the door. - "Beep!" "Beep!"

173
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,240
Is that you? Did you swallow the choirboy?

174
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,840
I'm glad!

175
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,880
Every time you screw up,
I can spot you.

176
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:15,160
- Go clean the toilets!
- "Beep, beep, beep!"

177
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:18,160
This doesn't sit well with me.

178
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:22,960
He has the face of a cruiser, of a
traitor, like Judas "Iscariotola".

179
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:27,320
The last dinner we'll have together,
he will kiss me and betray me.

180
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:39,001
- Bye, see you tomorrow.
- Don't hit on Marco. - Okay.

181
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:44,561
- Hi, we haven't introduced ourselves.
- We have time.

182
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:49,401
- Your father wants you to take me.
- He wants to keep his distance.

183
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:55,441
- Lucky him!
- I wonder what they're up to tonight.

184
00:15:55,481 --> 00:16:00,362
- They won't do anything, Marco
has other things to think about. - Bitch.

185
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:04,802
It's on its way.
All right. Drop the cigarette!

186
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:09,562
Today maybe my dream comes true,
to become a band director.

187
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:14,402
Silence. Let me make a good impression
with the mayor. Attention!

188
00:16:16,283 --> 00:16:19,283
- Morning.
- Commands. Shhh!

189
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:24,322
Dear Principal.

190
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:28,802
- Sorry. - Thank you for being part
of our city complex.

191
00:16:28,843 --> 00:16:32,922
- It is a lesson for us
and a source of pride. - Thank you.

192
00:16:32,963 --> 00:16:38,363
I too am happy to serve
the stave of this band,

193
00:16:38,403 --> 00:16:42,003
belonged to the late master
Michele Sciasciamocca.

194
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:46,843
To him I address a "ladle" remembrance,
we will have 50 minutes of recollection.

195
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:49,043
Now let's talk about more cheerful things.

196
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:53,123
Now you will tell us the name
Of the new bandmaster...

197
00:16:53,164 --> 00:16:57,684
Dear friends, I now announce
the name of the new master.

198
00:16:57,723 --> 00:17:03,324
He is a great talent who works here
and has a diploma as a band master

199
00:17:03,363 --> 00:17:06,523
obtained at the conservatory
of Naples.

200
00:17:06,564 --> 00:17:10,804
To him I entrust the direction
of the band. Come, maestro.

201
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:13,004
Thank you.

202
00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:14,644
Morning.

203
00:17:17,524 --> 00:17:21,284
Here is Judas "Iscariot." He has come
to collect the thirty denarii.

204
00:17:21,324 --> 00:17:23,085
God, I think I'm dying!

205
00:17:23,124 --> 00:17:30,004
- Friends, I present the master
Salvatore Pinzarrone. - Thank you.

206
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:35,565
Come, Dean. One more word.

207
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:41,924
I emphasize the dedication and the democratic sense
democratic sense of Prof. Laricchiuta,

208
00:17:41,965 --> 00:17:45,324
who,
faithful to the musical discipline,

209
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:49,645
is happy to humbly place himself
at the orders of his janitor.

210
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:53,725
Goodbye and good work to all.

211
00:17:58,405 --> 00:18:02,805
- Here we go. First of all,
good morning. - Good morning.

212
00:18:02,846 --> 00:18:05,885
- You go ahead.
- Please.

213
00:18:08,726 --> 00:18:13,126
- Go, go!
- I'm going, I'm going. - Yes, go.

214
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:18,125
Put yourself in your place. I guess
the principal is a little jealous.

215
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,766
What do you guys have in your repertoire?

216
00:18:20,806 --> 00:18:23,766
In the refectory,
we have pasta and beans.

217
00:18:24,766 --> 00:18:27,526
We're off to a good start!

218
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:31,486
I was saying, what do you have in your repertoire?!

219
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:36,526
- Everything, even the triumphal march
of Aida. - Let's start with that one.

220
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:39,966
Take care, guys,
a rigorous entrance.

221
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:44,967
All together, okay?
Ready? One, two and three!

222
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:05,627
ALT!

223
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:08,927
I don't hear the bass in "E."

224
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:13,607
- Mr. Principal, maybe you don't know it?
- I know it, I know it.

225
00:19:13,647 --> 00:19:16,807
I know
Giuseppe Verdi by heart, maestro!

226
00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:19,248
Teacher and Director.

227
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:24,527
All right, back to one.
One, two... and go!

228
00:19:28,207 --> 00:19:31,367
The highest bass!

229
00:19:36,768 --> 00:19:38,888
Louder the bass!

230
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:49,248
So we're out of time.
I love the "pa... ta"...

231
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:52,849
# Pa, ta, pa, ta,
pa, pa, pa, pa, ta, ta... #

232
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:56,809
- Yes. - Because the "pa"
is the bass note. - Right.

233
00:19:56,849 --> 00:20:02,169
You need to count the down time.
Ready? One, two...go!

234
00:20:11,329 --> 00:20:16,809
- Now that's music.
- Asshole, boor!

235
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:21,530
- Bravo!
- Asshole, scumbag, cuckold!

236
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:25,689
Bravo, bravo! That's it!

237
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:29,849
- Cocky, shitty!
- Bravo, bravo!

238
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,770
Is it possible that it's not there? Mah!

239
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,930
Angela? Angela?

240
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,570
Angela?

241
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,530
Blessed mother, what a "butt"!

242
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:15,811
What nipples!

243
00:21:27,331 --> 00:21:31,371
Holy shit, a guy comes into the bedroom
to have a conversation...

244
00:21:31,411 --> 00:21:35,611
...and expects to find her
in a fur coat or a coat....

245
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:38,371
...but this one only has skin.

246
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:43,051
Why do you always think of that?
You suck, my Pasquale!

247
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:46,491
You have it here,
the feminists are right.

248
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:49,771
"Repressed male,
we will cut off your sex!"

249
00:21:49,812 --> 00:21:52,932
"You're ugly, you're mule,
you'll take it in the c... "

250
00:21:52,972 --> 00:21:56,611
What time is it?
I'd better go.

251
00:21:56,652 --> 00:21:59,052
This one is still good, though.

252
00:22:02,452 --> 00:22:06,492
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
Don't escape me, there's time anyway.

253
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:09,372
Where do you go on those "canopies",
for "canopies"?

254
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:15,933
I'm going to Fedora now. I am sweating
like a New Zealand crocodile.

255
00:22:15,972 --> 00:22:18,813
I go to Fedora and make four.

256
00:22:18,852 --> 00:22:23,092
One dressed as a Red Corsair,
one dressed as Dracula...

257
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,252
Let's leave it at that.

258
00:22:45,053 --> 00:22:48,733
- Thief!
- It wasn't me!

259
00:22:48,773 --> 00:22:54,854
What thief? You wretch!
It's me, don't you recognize me? Shut up!

260
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:58,893
A double! I killed it.

261
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:19,054
Angela! Angela! Angela!

262
00:23:29,054 --> 00:23:35,175
Armor-piercing missiles!
Proton beams! Come on!

263
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:37,095
"But the hell with it... "

264
00:23:58,215 --> 00:24:02,015
Give it a kick
or a bump on the head!

265
00:24:10,495 --> 00:24:11,976
Oh my God, that one wakes up!

266
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:16,095
- How did you come up with that?
- Never mind, but speak softly.

267
00:24:16,136 --> 00:24:19,096
- Does it hurt?
- A little.

268
00:24:19,136 --> 00:24:22,896
I see the key moving
and it's clear that I get scared.

269
00:24:22,936 --> 00:24:27,416
- It was like a horror movie.
- I'm sorry, but...

270
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:33,056
- What did you have in mind? Don't you think
...about Irma? - What about her?

271
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:36,816
You don't have to wrong her
And I don't like subterfuge.

272
00:24:36,856 --> 00:24:40,536
If a guy has intentions,
let him tell me.

273
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:44,216
I just wanted to
go out the window.

274
00:24:44,256 --> 00:24:46,976
Dad goes out
and locks the front door.

275
00:24:47,017 --> 00:24:50,737
This was my room
and it's easy to get out of here.

276
00:24:50,777 --> 00:24:53,297
Isn't there another window?

277
00:24:53,337 --> 00:24:57,017
No, it's the only one near the grate.
It's like a ladder.

278
00:24:57,057 --> 00:25:01,817
- Did you really just want to come by?
- I swear. - You wanted to hang out with Irma?

279
00:25:01,857 --> 00:25:06,097
What about Irma? I go out every night
to play with friends.

280
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:08,458
If my dad knows, he'll kill me.

281
00:25:08,497 --> 00:25:12,578
- Your mother doesn't know?
- She died when I was born.

282
00:25:12,617 --> 00:25:17,017
- So, the one in the mud bath
isn't your mother? - She's the stepmother.

283
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:22,058
It's not in the mud, it's gone,
but Dad wants to keep up appearances.

284
00:25:22,097 --> 00:25:24,898
- Marco?
- Yes?

285
00:25:26,178 --> 00:25:30,978
- You're a good boy. - I'm going, or
or you'll break another vase over my head.

286
00:25:31,418 --> 00:25:36,418
He didn't even try. This
place where he plays must be cool.

287
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:59,699
- Did you come to see?
- Hi.

288
00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:03,939
- You are strong, but there is no one
to help you out? - He's at the bar.

289
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:08,019
- That's one deadbeat.
- What time do you play "The Silence"?

290
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:12,299
- Give us a hand you. - Do you know
"Whatever you want, with whom you want"?

291
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:16,660
- How not. - Now I'm going to play you
a fantastic song.

292
00:26:16,699 --> 00:26:20,659
It's a dizzying rhythm
of the international disco-music.

293
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:23,500
It is entitled
"As You Wish, With Whom You Wish."

294
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:33,300
# Easy to stay out of it,
be tough and say no. #

295
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:39,420
# Easy to stand by and watch,
for all I know. #

296
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:45,620
# Lay aside to sleep,
only half laughing. #

297
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:51,940
# Better make love and go
in search of happiness. #

00:27:24,021 --> 00:27:29,861

305
00:27:29,902 --> 00:27:36,381
# Better an overbearing yes or no,

306
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:42,701

307
00:27:42,742 --> 00:27:49,022

pure, without ifs and buts. #

00:28:25,082 --> 00:28:26,983
Sit down! Quiet!

312
00:28:28,143 --> 00:28:30,703
I see a new student.

313
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:34,663
- I am Angela Mancinelli and I come
from Rome. - I was already informed.

314
00:28:34,703 --> 00:28:39,063
- Repeat offender? - If he was informed,
he should know. - Witty.

315
00:28:39,103 --> 00:28:42,903
It's also a lot of fun.
Come on in, have a seat.

316
00:28:44,983 --> 00:28:47,384
Let's see what condition it's in.

317
00:28:47,423 --> 00:28:52,584
I'm not referring to the physical ones,
which I think are excellent.

318
00:28:52,623 --> 00:28:55,984
Witty, but not very funny.

319
00:28:56,024 --> 00:28:59,784
Silence.
I see you have your line ready.

320
00:28:59,824 --> 00:29:04,264
- Let's put aside the skirmishes
and get down to business. - Sure.

321
00:29:04,304 --> 00:29:08,945
We are reviewing the program
from the second year. What do you remember?

322
00:29:08,984 --> 00:29:13,224
- It was very boring. - Do you prefer
modern history? - Neither.

323
00:29:13,264 --> 00:29:17,985
It's always the same: People in power
and poor people to the slaughter.

324
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:23,305
That's why history must be studied,
so as not to repeat the same mistakes.

325
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:28,825
- Maybe, but so far it hasn't helped.
- Still, the story needs to be studied.

326
00:29:28,864 --> 00:29:34,105
- Next time she will be
questioned. - It's like I told you.

327
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:38,225
There are people who have power
and people who go to slaughter.

328
00:29:38,265 --> 00:29:40,585
Go to location.

329
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:48,945
- Well done, Angela, you got him.
- Laricchiuta!

330
00:29:48,986 --> 00:29:53,705
Your approval is not needed,
the young lady is already conceited.

331
00:29:53,746 --> 00:29:57,866
- Okay. - Have you done your research
on the Hundred Years War?

332
00:29:57,906 --> 00:30:02,305
- I'm making them. Those took
a hundred years. - Quiet!

333
00:30:02,346 --> 00:30:06,106
I expect them tomorrow,
otherwise I'll talk to the principal.

334
00:30:06,145 --> 00:30:10,386
- How naughty! You could give him
more time. - You be quiet!

335
00:30:10,426 --> 00:30:13,826
- In fact, come here.
- Gladly.

336
00:30:16,706 --> 00:30:19,546
- Tell me about Henry VIII.
- With pleasure.

337
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:22,906
It is the most interesting
representative of the Tudors.

338
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:28,506
Sadomasochist, romantic, maniacal
sexual, vigorous, intelligent...

339
00:30:28,546 --> 00:30:31,907
He spent his life
in search of the ideal love...

340
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:37,787
...facing 6 marriages,
excommunications, remorse and mothers-in-law.

341
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:58,067
- Salvatore!
- Oh my God!

342
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:02,667
So I like you. You have to say:
"You command, Mr. Principal."

343
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:04,867
School is a different tune.

344
00:31:04,907 --> 00:31:08,867
Since you became director
of the band and I didn't... You know how it is.

345
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:13,988
- It's fate that wanted it.
- No, it's the "asshole", the mayor.

346
00:31:14,028 --> 00:31:18,108
- I undo it with a stab.
- You are still the principal.

347
00:31:18,148 --> 00:31:21,748
Since you became
band director and I didn't...

348
00:31:21,788 --> 00:31:25,548
...people may think that between us
there's an atavistic hatred, but no.

349
00:31:25,588 --> 00:31:29,748
- "Ba, ba, ba..."
- What are you hiding behind your back?

350
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:36,188
- Sketching a new march.
- On Rome? - No, to my band.

351
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:40,189
Why do you say "my band"?
I play in the band too, don't I?

352
00:31:40,229 --> 00:31:45,348
- Well... - What do you mean? I don't play
well, maybe? - Very well. - Here.

353
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:47,869
- Let me read.
- Sure.

354
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:51,429
It's cute.

355
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:55,709
- It's on the beat.
- It's on the upbeat. - It's on beat.

356
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:02,229
- It's on the beat.
- Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa... #

357
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:05,870
- It's in upbeat!
- You missed a "biscromola."

358
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:17,510
- It's on the upbeat! - The finale
is beautiful, it's more majestic. Here.

359
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:20,050
- I can already feel that it's good.
- It is.

360
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,109
What is it?

361
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,190
It's the dishes at the end.

362
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:32,470
Mr. Principal, I heard you
a little wan. Listen to this.

363
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,510
Did you buy the new chorister?

364
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:41,470
- No, I got it back.
- "To lass, to pass, to cass."

365
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,390
You don't understand shit.
Let me hear it again.

366
00:32:48,231 --> 00:32:51,350
- Did you growl at the choirboy?
- Yes.

367
00:32:51,391 --> 00:32:54,310
It's a cycle
ascending and descending.

368
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:58,150
You must write the music,
damn you? What do you know?

369
00:32:58,191 --> 00:33:02,471
10,000 lire fine because you write
music during class hours,

370
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:07,231
10,000 for contempt of Stravinski,
and 40,000 for being obnoxious.

371
00:33:07,271 --> 00:33:11,031
I studied music for a lifetime,
eight years in juvie!

372
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:15,471
Now clean the toilets. This is
your big orchestra, conduct it.

373
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:20,831
Excuse me, Mr. Principal.
It's a joke by the kids for me.

374
00:33:20,871 --> 00:33:26,792
Here, what's yours is yours!
Go clean the toilets!

375
00:33:26,831 --> 00:33:31,631
You wretch, damn you!
I never want to see you again!

376
00:33:31,672 --> 00:33:34,212
Get lost, "bitch."

377
00:33:35,952 --> 00:33:37,752
I was kidding!

378
00:33:38,552 --> 00:33:42,912
- Who is it?
- It's Marco. - Come in, it's open.

379
00:33:42,952 --> 00:33:47,793
- Hi. - Hi, do you need to come over?
- I'm supposed to go out, but I'm in trouble.

380
00:33:47,832 --> 00:33:51,872
I have not yet prepared the research
on the Hundred Years' War.

381
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:55,993
If I don't bring it, Casalotti tells it
to daddy, who beats with the belt.

382
00:33:56,033 --> 00:34:00,152
- Is there anything I can do?
- What do you want to do? It's a mess.

383
00:34:00,192 --> 00:34:03,992
Wait, I should have a book.

384
00:34:04,032 --> 00:34:06,433
Be sure to keep it short.

385
00:34:10,273 --> 00:34:15,073
- I found it. It's a book about
Joan of Arc. - What do I do with it?

386
00:34:15,112 --> 00:34:19,793
In the preface there is a summary
of the Hundred Years' War.

387
00:34:19,833 --> 00:34:23,913
Was Joan of Arc also part
of the Hundred Years' War?

388
00:34:23,953 --> 00:34:27,793
- I just heard about it, too.
- I should copy it down.

389
00:34:27,834 --> 00:34:32,673
- Those are waiting for me, though.
- Do you need full service?

390
00:34:32,713 --> 00:34:37,034
- Give me, for tonight
I give up going with you. - Sorry.

391
00:34:37,073 --> 00:34:41,193
Me, Enzo and Gino are repeaters
just for history and philosophy.

392
00:34:41,234 --> 00:34:45,153
They will fail us again this year,
Casalotti is a beast.

393
00:34:45,194 --> 00:34:49,714
- I noticed.
- Down with Casalotti!

394
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:54,834
They transferred him here from Milan
and he feels like a boss in exile.

395
00:34:54,874 --> 00:34:59,354
- So he takes it out on us.
- Poor guy. - Poor us!

396
00:34:59,395 --> 00:35:02,154
Marco, I have an idea.

397
00:35:02,194 --> 00:35:06,515
He is also a man of flesh and blood
and he's also very cute.

398
00:35:06,554 --> 00:35:10,875
- What do you want to do? - Get him to have
a good crush and make him soft.

399
00:35:10,915 --> 00:35:15,354
- Do you think I'm not capable of that?
- Sure, I almost got it.

400
00:35:15,395 --> 00:35:18,914
But that one
won't let me get near it, it's a bear.

401
00:35:18,955 --> 00:35:23,875
- If I asked for private lessons?
- That's so cool! You are so cool.

402
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:29,635
- But I'm a little jealous.
- Marco, don't you dare, understand?

403
00:35:29,675 --> 00:35:32,995
Aren't you going to kiss me tonight?

404
00:35:33,035 --> 00:35:37,035
- Now go.
- All right. - Go play.

405
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:46,075
- Pasquale? - What is it?
- Wait for me, I'm coming with you.

406
00:35:46,116 --> 00:35:51,116
All right, come with me.
That figures. She's coming with me.

407
00:35:51,955 --> 00:35:56,556
- What are you doing? - I have to disguise myself,
this is a disgraced country.

408
00:35:56,596 --> 00:36:02,636
They already say I have 25 lovers, if they
they see you, you become the 26th.

409
00:36:02,676 --> 00:36:07,596
- I need to talk to you. - Then I put on
the glasses. Is that serious?

410
00:36:07,636 --> 00:36:13,436
- I need to take classes in history
and philosophy. - I am so busy.

411
00:36:13,476 --> 00:36:17,636
I wasn't talking to you, but I would like
that you talk to Casalotti about it.

412
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:22,156
- So it might be a little more
lenient. - You're "crafty."

413
00:36:22,197 --> 00:36:26,437
- Casalotti is not dumb, he has a
brain that "spins". - How?

414
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:30,837
- He's smart and educated,
he's not dumb. I can't. - Please.

415
00:36:30,877 --> 00:36:33,117
If you tell me so...I can.

416
00:36:33,997 --> 00:36:38,317
- Good morning, Mr. Principal!
- What did I tell you?

417
00:36:38,357 --> 00:36:42,717
- What are you looking for?
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Principal.

418
00:36:42,757 --> 00:36:46,557
- Merry Christmas? - Christmas has passed.
- Happy Easter.

419
00:36:46,597 --> 00:36:50,638
- Easter must come. - I wanted to
to say hello to this piece of Easter.

420
00:36:50,677 --> 00:36:55,597
- You greet that Lent of
your sister. - I am an only child.

421
00:36:55,637 --> 00:36:59,997
- See you at the rehearsal. - Try
to go fuck yourself. - Thank you.

422
00:37:00,038 --> 00:37:04,198
Did you see that "shithole" country?
Everyone recognizes me.

423
00:37:04,237 --> 00:37:06,437
Let's go to school. You drive.

424
00:37:07,718 --> 00:37:10,718
- Let me see.
- What are you doing?

425
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:14,158
Did you get in?

426
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:18,638
Bravo! You didn't call me!

427
00:37:18,678 --> 00:37:21,478
It's Salvatore! Shut up!

428
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:37,799
You know what he does? He writes music.
Now we give him a catch.

429
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,039
- Have you seen the janitor's "jerk"?
- No.

430
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,999
- If you see it, send it to the
presidency. - Yes, Mr. Principal.

431
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:52,279
Guys, let's go find him.

432
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:56,119
Did you see how pissed off he was?

433
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,520
Just now I got
inspiration! How does this one speak?

434
00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:09,799
Oh my God, the calzones!

435
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:18,999
You make me die of "heart attack"!
I suffer from extrasystoles in my heart!

436
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,680
I am the principal!

437
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,800
How do they make me an education
if my mistress comes here?

438
00:38:25,841 --> 00:38:29,960
- Don't change the subject. Who is
that girl? - What girl?

439
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,640
- Do you believe a letter carrier
"bitchy" and cuckolded? - Yes.

440
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,921
She's a student. I'm a principal
and I have 2,000 students, okay?

441
00:38:39,961 --> 00:38:43,400
You know
I would never betray you, love.

442
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,561
You put on men's makeup,
but they can tell you're a woman.

443
00:38:47,601 --> 00:38:50,841
This is what the
the Japanese proverb...

444
00:38:50,881 --> 00:38:54,321
... "Zizza prominent,
imminent danger".

445
00:38:54,361 --> 00:38:59,001
- Go, don't make me horny. - No,
until you tell me who that is!

446
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:04,321
Ah! The hand! How she bites this
cursed, wretched, jealous.

447
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:08,762
- I'm telling you the truth:
She is a close relative of mine. - Oh!

448
00:39:08,801 --> 00:39:15,241
I'll introduce you to her and tell her
that you're my cousin, okay?

449
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:18,922
- That's good, love...
- Go away, though.

450
00:39:18,961 --> 00:39:21,802
- Looking for me?
- No!

451
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:26,042
What do you want? Why don't you knock
before you come in?

452
00:39:26,081 --> 00:39:30,802
Fine! Am I interrupting?
If not, I'm leaving.

453
00:39:30,842 --> 00:39:36,242
No, I was talking to the accountant.
Accountant, we're not kids anymore.

454
00:39:36,282 --> 00:39:41,122
- We are forty years old, while your
son is twenty. - Forty?

455
00:39:41,162 --> 00:39:45,643
- Don't you know how old I am?
- Are we on a first-name basis, accountant?

456
00:39:45,682 --> 00:39:50,323
- Yeah, you cheesy little runt.
Hold this! - What's he doing?

457
00:39:50,362 --> 00:39:53,563
The more queer they are
the more rude they are.

458
00:39:53,603 --> 00:39:58,563
No, it's because... Who's a fag?
Why did you say he was a fag?

459
00:39:58,602 --> 00:40:03,522
- No one is queer! - Ouch!
- Stay out of this and get out!

460
00:40:03,563 --> 00:40:08,883
Excuse me, accountant, but it's better
to leave. We'll talk about it later.

461
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:14,083
Yes, but the story doesn't end there,
you idiot! Take this other one!

462
00:40:15,564 --> 00:40:21,324
- At home we do the math. - Where?
- She lives in the building across the street.

463
00:40:23,484 --> 00:40:29,043
- Mr. Principal, you may be an accountant,
but you have a nice ass! - It's true.

464
00:40:29,084 --> 00:40:34,604
- Yeah... Did I break the spell?
- No, you broke my balls.

465
00:40:34,884 --> 00:40:38,404
There, it's moving... That's it.

466
00:40:38,444 --> 00:40:41,244
- Close the door.
- Yes.

467
00:40:43,364 --> 00:40:49,445
Asshole! Faggot in disguise!
At the rehearsal I'll kick his ass!

468
00:40:49,844 --> 00:40:54,324
I'm still the master anyway,
and this march is to be played...

469
00:40:54,365 --> 00:40:57,925
In your face
and that son of a bitch!

470
00:40:57,964 --> 00:41:00,044
Call your mom!

471
00:41:00,084 --> 00:41:03,965
- Do you know that I am
in love with you? - Who with?

472
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:08,765
- About you, but you do not wire me
at all. - I... I'm busy.

473
00:41:08,804 --> 00:41:13,485
Then I have school,
the band, the orchestra and...

474
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:18,725
- Now excuse me, but I have to go. Bye.
- Bye.

475
00:41:22,725 --> 00:41:25,165
- Hi, Gino.
- Hi.

476
00:41:35,685 --> 00:41:39,486
Don't waste time,
he's cooked anyway.

477
00:41:39,525 --> 00:41:43,606
- He won't even look at me.
- What do you care? I'll look at you.

478
00:41:43,645 --> 00:41:48,725
- You look at me and do not speak.
- Speak, speak! Mount.

479
00:41:48,766 --> 00:41:53,166
- Where are we going to "fav"?
- What do you think? I love Marco.

480
00:41:53,206 --> 00:41:55,606
All right, I'll train you.

481
00:41:56,246 --> 00:41:59,966
His uncle told me
that he needs tutoring.

482
00:42:00,006 --> 00:42:04,286
I wanted to apologize for how
I acted in class.

483
00:42:04,327 --> 00:42:07,327
Never mind, it's water under the bridge.

484
00:42:07,366 --> 00:42:12,007
In response to shyness,
sometimes I put on a brave face.

485
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:15,886
For being shy,
she defends herself quite well.

486
00:42:15,927 --> 00:42:19,007
Anyway, let's get down to business.

487
00:42:19,046 --> 00:42:24,167
- In which part of the program
do you feel the weakest? - In everything.

488
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:29,287
Maybe it's because I've never
never managed to get passionate...

489
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:32,047
...but with her it's a different story.

490
00:42:32,087 --> 00:42:38,088
Best. We will do a general review
general, following the text.

491
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:44,007
Would you like me to read?

492
00:42:45,967 --> 00:42:52,647
Sorry, I didn't know
you were here. Excuse me, miss.

493
00:42:52,688 --> 00:42:58,488
- Do you think so?
- I'll get out of your hair!

494
00:43:03,808 --> 00:43:07,648
He also lives here as a sublet
and I didn't warn him.

495
00:43:07,688 --> 00:43:11,608
It looks very nice
and it must be good too.

496
00:43:11,648 --> 00:43:16,528
He is an excellent friend and an
excellent. We were saying.

497
00:43:16,568 --> 00:43:22,008
- May I? - Come in.
- Professor, here's your tea.

498
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:27,449
- Just one? Will you take it, miss?
- Yes, please. - Sit down.

499
00:43:27,488 --> 00:43:30,289
Actually,
I made it for you.

500
00:43:30,329 --> 00:43:34,328
- Then make another one,
please. - All right.

501
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:41,809
She's the hostess of the house. She's a good
woman, but rather primitive.

502
00:43:41,849 --> 00:43:44,769
It's not bad and it's quite young.

503
00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:48,570
- I bet she's
in love with her. - What does she say?

504
00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:53,090
What's the big deal? It is not easy
to find an interesting man.

505
00:43:54,409 --> 00:43:57,529
You let go...
and start reading.

506
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:04,490
- Here, commander.
How are you feeling? - Better.

507
00:44:04,529 --> 00:44:08,930
- With the tranquilizers,
I don't have the visions anymore. - Good.

508
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,930
You are beautiful!

509
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:27,970
You are beautiful...

510
00:44:29,691 --> 00:44:34,690
- Tell me something.
- Yes, it's 8:29 p.m.

511
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:40,811
- What do you say? Tell me if you're happy.
- Sure, but it's 30 seconds away.

512
00:44:40,851 --> 00:44:46,171
- Tell me you love me. - Yes, I love you,
but it's late. - What about it?

513
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:50,971
Ah! Help! Oh God, the water!

514
00:44:51,011 --> 00:44:55,011
- I tried to tell you, but you never
you never let me finish! - Come on.

515
00:44:55,051 --> 00:44:57,331
The visions begin again!

516
00:45:00,172 --> 00:45:02,171
It feels like the rainy season.

517
00:45:21,132 --> 00:45:24,852
- Miss Mancinelli!
- Good morning.

518
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:28,692
I thought it would be better
not to see each other at my house.

519
00:45:28,732 --> 00:45:32,452
- You know... the lady of the house is here.
- Where shall we meet?

520
00:45:32,492 --> 00:45:37,773
- Meet me here at the same time,
then we'll decide. - Agreed.

521
00:45:37,812 --> 00:45:42,853
Angela? I can see it working.
How does she act? Does she try?

522
00:45:42,892 --> 00:45:48,333
- No way! He's dead serious. - Then he
he's got a crush, poor guy.

523
00:45:48,372 --> 00:45:51,853
- Why?
- He will suffer, I know something about that.

524
00:45:51,893 --> 00:45:55,773
Ever since you arrived, I...
I don't know how to say this, but...

525
00:45:55,813 --> 00:45:59,213
- Shut up, you clown!
- Why are you telling me this?

526
00:45:59,253 --> 00:46:04,253
- If you get involved with me, I'm going to get
even fail. - Good effort!

527
00:46:05,133 --> 00:46:07,853
Good evening, guys, all set.

528
00:46:07,893 --> 00:46:11,494
Sorry for the delay,
but I had to make some scores.

529
00:46:11,533 --> 00:46:17,494
Hand them out, let's get started.
Come on, now let's have a first reading.

530
00:46:17,534 --> 00:46:23,213
It's a march I've been dreaming about for a long time,
I couldn't sleep at night to do it.

531
00:46:23,254 --> 00:46:26,934
Recommendation,
come on with the cymbals and the bass drum.

532
00:46:26,974 --> 00:46:30,453
Ready? One, two... go!

533
00:46:34,854 --> 00:46:40,374
Does anyone feel like joking?
But I'm a son of a bitch!

534
00:46:40,414 --> 00:46:44,254
Don't worry, everyone has
the mom she deserves. From the top.

535
00:46:44,295 --> 00:46:50,254
- No! I'll say it from the top!
- You say it, da capo. - From the top.

536
00:46:50,295 --> 00:46:55,174
From the top. What are you doing with those dishes?
You look like you're in pain.

537
00:46:55,215 --> 00:46:58,935
They don't come off, maybe someone
put some glue on them.

538
00:46:58,975 --> 00:47:01,655
Let's not waste any more time.

539
00:47:01,695 --> 00:47:04,935
Guys, take care. One, two...

540
00:47:17,295 --> 00:47:19,295
No!

541
00:47:20,935 --> 00:47:25,735
I don't hear that phrasing
of the bass in "E." What is it?

542
00:47:25,775 --> 00:47:32,136
- I don't feel anything. Would you like to
a solo? - Guys, guys!

543
00:47:32,175 --> 00:47:36,536
- Are you sick?
- I'm perfectly fine. You're a witness.

544
00:47:36,575 --> 00:47:40,135
- She's fine... Yes, I can see her.
- Take it easy.

545
00:47:40,176 --> 00:47:45,056
- Does he have a tie too?
- Stop, Salvatore. I'll kill you.

546
00:47:45,096 --> 00:47:49,736
Mr. Principal, at school
you're in charge, but he's in charge here.

547
00:47:49,776 --> 00:47:55,337
- Give me the drum, I'll do
I'll do the tambourine. - Give it to him.

548
00:47:55,376 --> 00:47:59,737
- Calm. - Wipe off your sweat.
- Yes, master. - Sweat!

549
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:03,137
- Do you have your handkerchief?
- Yes, I do.

550
00:48:03,176 --> 00:48:08,177
Here's the handkerchief. Now we dry
the sweat to our principal.

551
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:14,617
- Let me kill him. - Take it easy.
- I'll kill him once.

552
00:48:14,657 --> 00:48:19,057
Then I'm off for 400 days.
Now I break his eye and....

553
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:23,577
- Ahhh! - There you go.
- It's breaking my handkerchief!

554
00:48:23,617 --> 00:48:28,417
- Let me respond. - Better not.
- I'll just break his knee.

555
00:48:28,977 --> 00:48:32,337
- Does he eat it?
- No, I vent.

556
00:48:32,378 --> 00:48:39,058
Our principal makes us listen to
a solo by Judas "Iscariotola."

557
00:48:39,098 --> 00:48:41,457
Crustacean!

558
00:48:41,497 --> 00:48:47,497
- Ready? - Yep.
- Ready? - Yeah! - One, two...

559
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:50,338
Blow! Blow!

560
00:48:54,978 --> 00:48:59,858
Bravo!!! If it was you three,
this time you got it right!

561
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,339
We can rest easy here.

562
00:49:10,379 --> 00:49:14,698
When I'm waiting for Marco, Gino comes,
when I wait for Gino you come.

563
00:49:14,739 --> 00:49:20,499
- It's not going to be an organized thing?
- No, it's fate. - It will be.

564
00:49:20,538 --> 00:49:24,979
- What would you like to do now?
- I think, therefore I exist.

565
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:29,219
- Don't think, kiss me!
- How? You mean me?

566
00:49:29,779 --> 00:49:33,859
From this reflection takes
the start of the Cartesian theory.

567
00:49:33,899 --> 00:49:39,419
Descartes poses as the supreme principle
supreme principle of knowledge the certainty...

568
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:45,939
- Is that him? - Eh... - Through
the world and the existence of God...

569
00:49:45,979 --> 00:49:51,060
- You follow me, miss? - Indeed,
it's a very fascinating conversation.

570
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:55,580
- I'm all about the chill.
- Are you cold? - No, I feel great.

571
00:49:55,620 --> 00:50:00,380
Let's continue, but be careful,
otherwise we're wasting time.

572
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:05,700
It may be the suggestion of the moonlight
moonlight, but he's good at it.

573
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:11,180
- Don't think about him now,
think about me. - Talk to me about philosophy.

574
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:17,701
- I am a materialist
and a Mazzinian. - Meaning?

575
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,380
That is, thought and action.

576
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:36,221
This is not a robbery,
it's a camouflage for love.

577
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,181
- Hello, beautiful. - What time do you call this?
I was just falling asleep.

578
00:50:40,221 --> 00:50:44,981
- I was late because
there is Angela. - Who? - Angela.

579
00:50:45,021 --> 00:50:49,262
I said you are my cousin
paternal on my mother's side ...

580
00:50:49,301 --> 00:50:52,982
- Fair enough.
- Bella! I'll call her for you now.

581
00:50:53,021 --> 00:50:58,742
- Angela? - The door!
- She and I are related.

582
00:50:58,781 --> 00:51:04,342
- Pleasure. - How nice!
- Darling... - It's delicious.

583
00:51:04,381 --> 00:51:10,542
Here... All right, that's it.
Oh! Oh! "Break, break."

584
00:51:10,582 --> 00:51:15,342
- You're a guy, huh? - I'm just
a guy. - Have a seat. - Thank you.

585
00:51:15,382 --> 00:51:19,782
Long time no see, Pasquale.
How's your wife?

586
00:51:19,822 --> 00:51:23,542
That daughter of a whore
She's gone!

587
00:51:23,582 --> 00:51:28,702
- Sorry! In this carpet
everyone's tripping on it. - Everyone who?

588
00:51:28,742 --> 00:51:33,782
- All... Anyway, sit down.
- Sit down, Angela. - Thank you.

589
00:51:33,823 --> 00:51:38,982
- You make yourself comfortable. - I'm sitting
next to Angela. - Whatever.

590
00:51:39,023 --> 00:51:43,062
- So you told Angela everything.
- What does Angela have to do with it now?

591
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:48,143
- He said Amalia ran away.
- Angela is me... - It's true!

592
00:51:48,183 --> 00:51:50,583
We messed up the situation.

593
00:51:53,023 --> 00:51:56,583
- Honey, aren't you cold?
- No, why?

594
00:51:56,624 --> 00:52:00,343
I am terribly hot,
this one bothers me.

595
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:04,183
It's a branded jacket.
Read this women's magazine.

596
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:08,104
- I don't like it. - Wretch,
read it! - Do you treat your granddaughter like this?

597
00:52:08,144 --> 00:52:13,304
- It's a beast. - You should try
to master that temper.

598
00:52:13,344 --> 00:52:18,863
- After all, we love each other very much.
- I'll buy you a liqueur. - Thank you.

599
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:23,344
- If you're an asshole, you won't see a dime.
- What did I say?

600
00:52:23,383 --> 00:52:27,544
Nothing, but you looked.
I'll break your cataract!

601
00:52:27,584 --> 00:52:31,784
- Beautiful, sweet!
- Do you need anything, Pasquale? - No, no, no.

602
00:52:31,824 --> 00:52:36,424
- Did you bring two?
- Yes. - Come and talk, dear.

603
00:52:36,464 --> 00:52:41,384
- You know what I was thinking?
- What? - We all three sit down.

604
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:46,184
I suffer from "solitudinemania"
and I'm better off with company.

605
00:52:46,225 --> 00:52:49,905
- Pasquale, I was talking
with your granddaughter. - Talk to her.

606
00:52:49,945 --> 00:52:54,544
I don't see a girl like Angela
I can't see her in a man's house.

607
00:52:54,585 --> 00:53:00,425
- Why don't you come over here?
Keep me company. - Yeah, I wish!

608
00:53:00,465 --> 00:53:06,385
- I have to stay with Uncle.
I'm fond of him. - What a star.

609
00:53:06,425 --> 00:53:10,105
- You'll see it anyway.
- What about the school?

610
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:14,585
You'll do as you always do. In the morning
go to school and come here in the evening.

611
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:18,226
Good, then I'll be free
to devote myself completely...

612
00:53:18,265 --> 00:53:24,346
- To what? - To the Japanese
Japanese... - Yes. - In German.

613
00:53:24,386 --> 00:53:28,825
You'll see, we'll be good together.
You can come from tonight if you want.

614
00:53:28,866 --> 00:53:33,906
- Sure. - But no. - Let's start tomorrow.
tomorrow, I have to pack.

615
00:53:33,946 --> 00:53:38,426
- Whatever you say, dear. - Obviously,
will you sleep together? - Of course.

616
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:40,706
Between women, anyway.

617
00:53:40,746 --> 00:53:45,866
Fedora, can you give me some more?
I feel a weight on my head....

618
00:53:47,906 --> 00:53:51,947
- Look, if you're being an asshole,
I'll have your back. - How?

619
00:53:51,987 --> 00:53:55,947
I'll slice off your balls
and feed them to you in a pan.

620
00:53:55,986 --> 00:53:59,067
But, Uncle! Between women, anyway...

621
00:54:02,187 --> 00:54:04,267
Miss Angela?

622
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,907
Good morning, Professor.

623
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:14,467
You can come over to my house tonight,
so you won't catch a cold.

624
00:54:14,507 --> 00:54:19,268
My landlady has left
for Naples, so she won't disturb us.

625
00:54:19,307 --> 00:54:22,907
Don't worry, at home
there is always Prof. Cacioppo.

626
00:54:22,947 --> 00:54:28,308
- I would always be quiet though.
- Thank you. See you tonight. - Goodbye.

627
00:54:33,467 --> 00:54:37,028
- Is there any news?
- Yes, he wants you at his place tonight.

628
00:54:37,068 --> 00:54:41,828
- The hostess has left.
- Then it melts! - I don't think so.

629
00:54:41,868 --> 00:54:45,948
- He pointed out that there is Cacioppo.
- Do you feel like risking it?

630
00:54:45,988 --> 00:54:50,228
- Should I be afraid of a man?
- What do we do with Cacioppo?

631
00:54:50,268 --> 00:54:55,308
- It takes a UFO to abduct him.
- Let's invent it. - Are you crazy?

632
00:54:55,349 --> 00:55:00,348
What does it take? My brother's
My brother's bike has a very powerful headlight.

633
00:55:00,389 --> 00:55:04,269
Then you just have to find an asshole
who wants some money.

634
00:55:04,308 --> 00:55:06,348
I have that one.

635
00:55:06,388 --> 00:55:10,109
The professor
sitting at his desk...

636
00:55:10,149 --> 00:55:14,629
...was reading by the light
of a table lamp.

637
00:55:14,669 --> 00:55:19,069
Suddenly, the light went out.

638
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:23,269
Minchia!
Mrs. Concitto, a candle!

639
00:55:23,989 --> 00:55:26,149
I said a candle!

640
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:33,709
Oh God! Oh God...
What is it? It's them!

641
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:37,909
It's the UFOs! UFOs!

642
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:52,830
UFOs! I don't stutter anymore!

643
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:57,510
Precipitously...

644
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:01,350
It's thanks to them.
I knew it, they're friends.

645
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:07,790
A Close Encounter
of the third kind.

646
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:16,911
Dickhead, sapien!
Yes, yes, yes, I'm coming...

647
00:56:16,951 --> 00:56:22,231
I come, I am friend.
Friend beautiful, beautiful!

648
00:56:22,871 --> 00:56:29,911
What? I feel like I'm flying!
I fly! I'm not afraid!

649
00:56:31,551 --> 00:56:35,511
- Where are you taking him? - To Ignazio's,
there are ten paid rides.

650
00:56:35,551 --> 00:56:40,111
It's beautiful,
but when do we get to the galaxies?

651
00:56:44,591 --> 00:56:47,832
While the Prussians
invaded France...

652
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:51,752
...the commune, dominated by Murat,
favored the popular reaction.

653
00:56:51,792 --> 00:56:55,831
In three days, over a thousand people
were massacred.

654
00:56:55,872 --> 00:57:01,711
- You seem upset, does the subject
Does it bother you? - No, go ahead.

655
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:07,512
- Is she worried about something?
- Cacioppo didn't show up.

656
00:57:07,552 --> 00:57:12,352
- It doesn't usually come out, but there's no
reason to worry. - Maybe.

657
00:57:12,392 --> 00:57:16,592
But to be alone with a man
as young and handsome as you are...

658
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:20,033
...and who speaks
in such a fascinating way...

659
00:57:20,072 --> 00:57:24,872
Let go, young lady.
If anything, you're charming.

660
00:57:24,912 --> 00:57:30,073
Respecting the students is for me
a point of honor, don't be afraid.

661
00:57:30,112 --> 00:57:36,233
I'm afraid of myself... and then
a woman in love is fragile.

662
00:57:42,353 --> 00:57:46,033
Professor, take me
Get me out of here, I want to digress.

663
00:57:46,073 --> 00:57:48,753
You're right, it's probably for the best.

664
00:57:48,793 --> 00:57:52,714
- Who is it?
- It's me, Angela.

665
00:57:54,993 --> 00:57:57,993
- Good evening, dear.
- Hi.

666
00:57:59,073 --> 00:58:04,474
- How did the class go?
- Which one? - The philosophy class.

667
00:58:04,513 --> 00:58:08,954
Ah, yes! Oh my!
How tired I am...nay, tired.

668
00:58:09,554 --> 00:58:14,434
- Tell me, cutie, did you have dinner?
- Yes, before the UFOs. - The UFOs?

669
00:58:14,474 --> 00:58:18,874
The "Ufonotti"... In class
we talked about the "Ufonotti".

670
00:58:18,914 --> 00:58:26,435
- Don't they say Huguenots? - It's true,
how ignorant I am in geography.

671
00:58:26,474 --> 00:58:32,274
- So, if you've had dinner...
...it's straight to bed. - Yes, yes.

672
00:59:32,876 --> 00:59:38,356
- I'll help you undress now.
- Never mind, I'll do it myself.

673
00:59:38,396 --> 00:59:42,756
Yes that matters, I like you so much!

674
00:59:42,796 --> 00:59:45,356
Do you like women?

675
00:59:48,916 --> 00:59:50,917
No.

676
00:59:52,917 --> 00:59:57,757
- Oh my God, did you find it?
- Seek and ye shall find!

677
00:59:57,797 --> 01:00:03,717
Sorry, but it was a secret. Do not tell
anyone, not even Pasqualino.

678
01:00:03,757 --> 01:00:09,837
- I don't even think about it. - So,
what are we waiting for? Let's get it on!

679
01:00:14,238 --> 01:00:19,878
- We wanted two orange sodas.
- It's compliments of the orchestra.

680
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:22,198
What about the orchestra?

681
01:00:23,917 --> 01:00:27,238
See.
Pacini, Fusecchia and Laricchiuta.

682
01:00:27,278 --> 01:00:31,998
They're good guys,
they earn their keep. Hi!

683
01:00:33,598 --> 01:00:36,838
We hope they don't gossip.

684
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:43,558
Hi, Angela, can you give us a hand?

685
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:47,478
- I'm busy, can't you see?
- Is he your boyfriend?

686
01:00:48,838 --> 01:00:53,678
- Yes, his name is Carlo.
- Lucky you, Carlo, buena suerte.

687
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,119
- Do you mind if I said that?
- No.

688
01:00:59,158 --> 01:01:01,559
Carlo, I have to tell you the truth.

689
01:01:01,598 --> 01:01:05,598
Something
wonderful, you know?

690
01:01:07,238 --> 01:01:12,439
- Sure. - Do you still care
about gossip anymore?

691
01:01:12,479 --> 01:01:14,479
I don't give a damn!

692
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:29,079
# I went through another day
with my usual problems. #

693
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:35,720
# And I...and then...who knows? #

694
01:01:38,519 --> 01:01:45,040
# An imprecise sense
disappointed longing. #

695
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:54,040
# The sudden encounter,
a gesture, an excuse... #

696
01:01:55,120 --> 01:02:02,280
# lo, regularly,
I will do as I always do. #

697
01:02:02,321 --> 01:02:05,800
# A bit of a mess... #

698
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:17,721
# But you stay close to me # #

699
01:02:19,081 --> 01:02:23,041
# ♪ Stay close to me #

700
01:02:25,961 --> 01:02:29,681
# ♪ I found you on time #

701
01:02:29,721 --> 01:02:40,842
# It's my daily crisis
With yes, with no, who knows? #

702
01:02:43,121 --> 01:02:49,882
# Total surrender,
the myth destroyed... #

703
01:02:49,922 --> 01:02:58,842
#... of me good for nothing,
capable of anything. #

704
01:02:59,322 --> 01:03:06,442
# He who sows the wind
reaps storms. #

705
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:09,882
# This is my destiny #

706
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:21,962
# But you stay close to me # #

707
01:03:23,562 --> 01:03:27,962
# ♪ Stay close to me #

708
01:03:29,763 --> 01:03:38,203
# I'll be a little bourgeois,
a little out there, a little decadent. #

709
01:03:38,243 --> 01:03:44,244
# And we, and then... I don't know. #

710
01:03:46,243 --> 01:03:53,243
# It's the possessive self
that's been lurking. #

711
01:03:53,284 --> 01:04:02,164
# An elective fact,
outdated. #

712
01:04:02,564 --> 01:04:12,764
# And I'll probably be
starting another mess. #

713
01:04:15,044 --> 01:04:24,884
# But you stay close to me # #

714
01:04:24,924 --> 01:04:29,404
# You stay close! #

715
01:04:34,005 --> 01:04:39,325
So, Laricchiuta, do you remember
where Joan of Arc was born?

716
01:04:39,365 --> 01:04:41,125
Where.

717
01:04:41,165 --> 01:04:46,005
- Domrémy.
- Do-re-mi. - What the hell are you saying?

718
01:04:46,045 --> 01:04:49,605
What the hell are you talking about?

719
01:04:49,645 --> 01:04:53,285
It's Domrémy, son, Domrémy.

720
01:04:53,325 --> 01:04:57,486
I understand that for a musician
it's an excused slip of the tongue.

721
01:04:57,525 --> 01:04:59,966
After all, this is notionism.

722
01:05:00,005 --> 01:05:04,685
Do you remember whose voices
that Joan of Arc heard?

723
01:05:04,726 --> 01:05:08,286
They were...the voices of consciousness.

724
01:05:08,326 --> 01:05:14,566
She said they were from St.
Catherine or St. Margaret's....

725
01:05:14,606 --> 01:05:17,846
In a bit, she even kisses him.

726
01:05:17,886 --> 01:05:21,406
- How long until the end?
- Two minutes.

727
01:05:21,446 --> 01:05:23,446
Watch out for the bell.

728
01:05:25,966 --> 01:05:33,246
But what is it? Yet there is nothing.
What did they do up here?

729
01:05:33,287 --> 01:05:35,526
If I catch them, I make them....

730
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:40,046
- Oh, sorry.
- Salvatore? - Yes?

731
01:05:40,086 --> 01:05:43,007
What do you do
always attached to the doorbell?

732
01:05:43,047 --> 01:05:47,247
- The kids messed with me.
- You tampered with me too, here.

733
01:05:47,287 --> 01:05:52,567
Today is St. Boniface and I am good.

734
01:05:52,607 --> 01:05:55,287
Ring the bell, which is now.

735
01:05:55,327 --> 01:05:59,687
- Here you are in charge, but there it is a different
music. - Do you see the difference?

736
01:05:59,727 --> 01:06:03,327
I am democratic
and you're "bitchy." I play it.

737
01:06:03,367 --> 01:06:05,808
Today is St. Boniface and I'm doing it.

738
01:06:11,448 --> 01:06:14,328
Let's say they tampered with it.

739
01:06:14,367 --> 01:06:19,208
They didn't know I'd play it
I, the fart was not for me.

740
01:06:19,248 --> 01:06:20,768
Mah!

741
01:06:20,807 --> 01:06:23,448
In a circuit
direct current...

742
01:06:23,488 --> 01:06:27,648
...between driving force "V",
current "I" and resistance "R"...

743
01:06:27,688 --> 01:06:30,008
...there is equality...

744
01:06:30,048 --> 01:06:34,568
- I told him not to come in
during class. - Get off!

745
01:06:34,608 --> 01:06:39,168
- This carabiniere... - Do you see
your scion? - Whose dog is it?

746
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:42,128
Your little boy
Picked him up off the street...

747
01:06:42,169 --> 01:06:46,689
...and made a leash with the
ties of your husband, my son.

748
01:06:46,728 --> 01:06:51,248
- He's a child at heart.
- Thank you. Looks like it to me too.

749
01:06:51,289 --> 01:06:56,969
Then you take it home with you
with the dog. I don't want the dog.

750
01:06:57,008 --> 01:06:59,289
I salute you, beautiful!

751
01:07:00,409 --> 01:07:04,969
- Still here?
- Where should I go? - Go away!

752
01:07:05,009 --> 01:07:08,089
Get it through your head that this
is a school, not a barracks!

753
01:07:09,629 --> 01:07:12,369
Don't mind her, Mom, she's crazy.

754
01:07:12,409 --> 01:07:17,649
- Now, Paoletto, shut him up.
- Shall I take him out? - Yes, honey.

755
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:20,810
Come on... bravo.

756
01:07:23,329 --> 01:07:26,890
Where were we?
We were talking about...

757
01:07:27,629 --> 01:07:29,490
Oh my!

758
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:35,530
You've been mauled!
I'm already reading the news.

759
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:39,650
"A master dog was killed
By a master dog."

760
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:46,091
- Salvatore, I'm so sorry.
- Don't worry, I'm fine!

761
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:51,370
In fact, I take this opportunity
to invite you to my concert.

762
01:07:51,411 --> 01:07:55,210
- I really care about her.
- Thank you, I will come with pleasure.

763
01:08:02,891 --> 01:08:06,690
- I can't hear the bass in "E"!
- Megalomaniac of a "crap"!

764
01:08:06,731 --> 01:08:11,051
- Mr. Principal, did you put
the sardine? - Your sister's!

765
01:08:11,091 --> 01:08:13,091
Come on, all together!

766
01:08:14,731 --> 01:08:17,651
Louder! The strongest bass!

767
01:08:17,691 --> 01:08:23,491
Never mind, let's do without
the bass. We'll do it without the bass.

768
01:08:26,491 --> 01:08:30,492
- What? - Mr. Principal,
are you a magician?

769
01:08:34,752 --> 01:08:39,852
- Keep playing!
- Oh my God, save the kitten!

770
01:08:44,012 --> 01:08:46,852
There you are! Ahhh!

771
01:08:52,372 --> 01:08:56,932
- Good dog. - Are you crazy?
That's the band director.

772
01:08:56,972 --> 01:09:01,212
- Thank you, Salvatore.
Did the dog hurt you? - No.

773
01:09:01,253 --> 01:09:04,133
- He's nice Salvatore, isn't he?
- He's sweet.

774
01:09:04,172 --> 01:09:07,732
You know what's nice about him, naked?
Nothing, it's disgusting.

775
01:09:12,252 --> 01:09:16,853
- Well? Are you coming?
- It's Marco's turn tonight.

776
01:09:16,893 --> 01:09:20,773
He doesn't want me, but I
I'm so in love with him.

777
01:09:20,813 --> 01:09:23,573
Irma, I have a confession to make.

778
01:09:23,613 --> 01:09:28,173
It's not true that he's hooking up with Angela.
It was on purpose... Sorry.

779
01:09:28,213 --> 01:09:33,293
- Assholes! - Irma, where are you going?
Wait! Irma!

780
01:09:34,294 --> 01:09:40,133
- Are you crying? - I came with you
to take revenge, and he is innocent.

781
01:09:40,174 --> 01:09:47,014
What do you care? What do you want
is one more little make-out session?

782
01:09:47,054 --> 01:09:52,934
- If I give you a ticket, will you give it to him?
- Sure, in fact, I have an idea.

783
01:09:52,974 --> 01:09:57,214
His room is on the mezzanine floor
and the window is always open.

784
01:09:57,254 --> 01:10:01,774
If I were you, I'd go into his room...
and crawl into bed.

785
01:10:01,814 --> 01:10:06,454
- Awesome! - You are so smitten.
I'm so jealous.

786
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:15,175
Angela! Angela!

787
01:10:15,214 --> 01:10:19,295
Honey, ever since you got here,
we've all been messing around.

788
01:10:19,334 --> 01:10:22,935
Relative or not relative,
let's get this tooth out of the way.

789
01:10:24,414 --> 01:10:29,735
- Mr. Principal, what an honor!
- What are you doing here?!

790
01:10:29,775 --> 01:10:34,495
Am I at home or at school?
With these two "feeding bottles," what do you do?

791
01:10:34,535 --> 01:10:37,855
After all
I'm not so "acci"...

792
01:10:37,895 --> 01:10:42,175
Yours and your grandfather's "ayes".
You are good as hell, Irma.

793
01:10:42,216 --> 01:10:45,935
- You came to see Angela?
- I was waiting for her to study.

794
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:50,335
Do you study in bed? With these
two tits... I'll give you a punch!

795
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:52,856
Let's make a deal, you and me.

796
01:10:52,896 --> 01:10:56,816
Let's make a deal between me...and you.

797
01:10:56,856 --> 01:11:01,216
In fact, let's make two deals,
between you and me. Ahh!

798
01:11:01,776 --> 01:11:06,336
- Madonna, what a bite! From where
did you enter? - Through the window.

799
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:11,096
- And out the window you go.
- Faggot! Faggot!

800
01:11:11,136 --> 01:11:14,656
You are going to die a bad death.
Wait.

801
01:11:14,696 --> 01:11:19,976
- Go away. Did you hear the blackbird?
- Too bad, while we were at it!

802
01:11:20,016 --> 01:11:24,977
Don't "whizz" me, I'll jump on you.
on you! Aren't you ashamed?

803
01:11:25,016 --> 01:11:29,016
- Close your eyes while
I get dressed. - I closed them.

804
01:11:29,056 --> 01:11:32,657
In fact, barred. Ah...

805
01:11:32,697 --> 01:11:38,056
Hurry up! I'm not made of "cast iron"
nor of iron.

806
01:11:38,097 --> 01:11:42,897
Go away, go away!
What a figure! What a figure!

807
01:11:42,937 --> 01:11:47,417
- From "asshole."
- It's true, that's why I'm going to kill you.

808
01:11:47,457 --> 01:11:51,338
I take your tongue, I
"rip it out... sparrow tongue.

809
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:05,657
- Bye, see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

810
01:12:12,658 --> 01:12:16,378
I'll make you
The bird with crystal feathers.

811
01:12:16,418 --> 01:12:20,178
I'll make a blackbird juice!
Where are you going? Come here.

812
01:12:20,218 --> 01:12:24,018
- Come here, you wretch!
- Pasquale? - Who is it?

813
01:12:24,058 --> 01:12:27,898
- What are you doing to Bartholomew?
- I was squeezing...

814
01:12:27,938 --> 01:12:32,059
This bird is sick, it's yellow.
Maybe it has viral hepatitis.

815
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:35,059
What hepatitis! What are you doing here?

816
01:12:35,099 --> 01:12:39,059
- What was Miss De Pettis doing in your bed?
De Pettis doing in your bed? - Irma?

817
01:12:39,098 --> 01:12:43,579
- She was as naked as a tapeworm.
- She must be pretty, naked.

818
01:12:43,618 --> 01:12:47,299
- She has a nice little personality.
- Undoubtedly, it's good.

819
01:12:47,338 --> 01:12:51,859
She's a nice girl... but there's...
...too much weird stuff going on.

820
01:12:51,899 --> 01:12:54,899
So, what were you doing here?

821
01:12:54,939 --> 01:12:59,579
I came because I heard
my cock whistling...

822
01:12:59,619 --> 01:13:02,739
...as if to say, "I can't breathe!"

823
01:13:02,779 --> 01:13:06,500
I understand you, Pasquale.
Come here, let's sit down.

824
01:13:06,539 --> 01:13:11,659
- Let's talk about this passion of yours
for me. - Really? - Yes.

825
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:18,059
Pasquale, you are nice,
brilliant and full of life.

826
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:23,180
- You'd be the ideal man for me.
- Would l? - Yes, you would.

827
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:30,900
I've thought about this so many times.
You are so beautiful, fresh, robust.

828
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:36,980
With this sensual mouth,
you make me want to give you...

829
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:39,820
...lots of little kisses.

830
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:47,820
I've noticed how you look at me.
I like men that strong.

831
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:53,060
- "Thank you." - It must be nice
To be held by your arms.

832
01:13:53,101 --> 01:13:55,061
I feel overwrought and upside down.

833
01:13:55,100 --> 01:14:01,141
- But... I like women.
- I didn't catch that.

834
01:14:01,181 --> 01:14:05,261
- I'm sorry for you, but I don't know
what to do about it. - Are you serious?

835
01:14:05,301 --> 01:14:09,181
Do you like women?
Blessed Mother, it can't be.

836
01:14:09,221 --> 01:14:14,981
A piece of "bernardola" like you!
Why are you stroking me, groping me?

837
01:14:15,021 --> 01:14:20,582
What should people say? That the
the principal's niece likes to...

838
01:14:20,621 --> 01:14:24,382
I'm going to kill myself, I'm going to break my ears.
I can't believe it.

839
01:14:25,222 --> 01:14:27,061
- Who is it?
- It's Marco.

840
01:14:27,102 --> 01:14:32,141
- Screw you. - Under the bed.
- Yes, like lovers. - Go.

841
01:14:32,182 --> 01:14:36,542
- We'll talk about it later.
- Shut up! - Maybe you were wrong.

842
01:14:36,582 --> 01:14:39,482
I don't come in here...

843
01:14:41,062 --> 01:14:46,103
- Next. - Sorry, Angela,
I'm already late. - Sch...

844
01:14:46,142 --> 01:14:49,742
Late...doing what?

845
01:14:50,102 --> 01:14:53,542
Latin version,
I forgot the vocabulary.

846
01:14:53,582 --> 01:14:56,982
I've got the dictionary.
I'll give it to you.

847
01:15:02,702 --> 01:15:06,663
- It sounded like a little scream to me.
- It must have been Bartholomew.

848
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:09,702
Of course it's an incredible blackbird.

849
01:15:09,743 --> 01:15:14,903
- Now go finish the version.
- Thank you, bye. - Bye.

850
01:15:19,704 --> 01:15:23,944
Ah! Blessed mother!
She has an iron on her feet.

851
01:15:23,983 --> 01:15:28,663
- Are you hurt? Shall I make you
a compress? - No, thanks.

852
01:15:28,703 --> 01:15:32,503
This is not where it hurts,
nor here.

853
01:15:32,544 --> 01:15:35,943
This is where it hurts me,
you hurt me.

854
01:15:35,984 --> 01:15:39,544
With a revolver,
I would have felt less pain.

855
01:15:39,584 --> 01:15:44,504
I am 43 years old, I am not a boy
15-year-old boy to be made fun of.

856
01:15:44,543 --> 01:15:48,704
I understood everything about you
and my asshole son.

857
01:15:48,744 --> 01:15:53,824
You make up a lot of nonsense....
"I like women..."

858
01:15:53,864 --> 01:15:59,184
You should have said, "You disgust me,
you're ugly and you're obese."

859
01:15:59,224 --> 01:16:04,984
I would have liked more.
Now don't say anything... What?

860
01:16:05,024 --> 01:16:11,345
Don't worry,
I'm a real man and I know how to lose.

861
01:16:11,385 --> 01:16:15,185
Hi... Ahh!

862
01:16:27,665 --> 01:16:32,065
When I interviewed them, I realized
that they don't study and they don't care.

863
01:16:32,105 --> 01:16:36,465
They're also being arrogant!
I can't stand them anymore.

864
01:16:37,145 --> 01:16:41,306
- They're kids, you could be more
lenient. - I'm doing this for them.

865
01:16:41,345 --> 01:16:45,426
- In exams, with the commission
don't mess around. - You're right.

866
01:16:45,465 --> 01:16:49,226
- I'll see you as usual.
- Hold on, I'll give you a ride.

867
01:16:49,266 --> 01:16:53,265
- Not afraid of small talk?
- Who cares!

868
01:16:59,866 --> 01:17:04,106
Son of a bitch!
Started again today with the 2.

869
01:17:04,146 --> 01:17:08,506
- That flunks us again.
- We can block it. - How?

870
01:17:08,546 --> 01:17:11,306
I steal Dad
the camera with the flash...

871
01:17:11,347 --> 01:17:15,587
...and as soon as he's with Angela, we'll take...
we'll take some compromising photos.

872
01:17:15,626 --> 01:17:20,746
- We're blackmailing him! - Angela
she'll never go for it, she's cooked too.

873
01:17:20,787 --> 01:17:23,627
We don't tell Angela anything.

874
01:17:23,667 --> 01:17:27,867
At the first opportunity,
we'll sneak in some photos.

875
01:17:27,907 --> 01:17:31,707
By now the pear is ripe.
Sooner or later, those... "vaffete"!

876
01:17:57,428 --> 01:18:02,468
- That's nice.
- Let's sit here. - Yeah, sure.

877
01:18:02,508 --> 01:18:06,748
- Wait, there's a little sand.
- Never mind.

878
01:18:06,787 --> 01:18:10,748
- Aren't you cold?
- With you it's impossible.

879
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:17,988
- I hope you're not going to talk to me about history
or philosophy. - If anything, theology.

880
01:18:18,028 --> 01:18:20,028
Oh, no!

881
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:26,509
- Don't be afraid, now
you have succeeded. - What?

882
01:18:26,548 --> 01:18:30,948
To make me fall in love. Isn't this what
you promised yourself you'd do?

883
01:18:30,989 --> 01:18:34,628
In the beginning
it was like a game, a challenge.

884
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:37,469
You used to bother me
with your smart-ass attitude.

885
01:18:37,508 --> 01:18:40,229
I wish I could have made you...whatever!

886
01:18:42,269 --> 01:18:45,789
Come... Sch!

887
01:18:45,829 --> 01:18:51,069
- "Quack, quack. - Get down,
if they see us, we're screwed.

888
01:18:51,109 --> 01:18:55,749
Let's leave it at that. I don't want to "hold
the snot," that's just mean.

889
01:18:55,789 --> 01:19:00,670
Come, come.
Madonna... and what is it?

890
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:11,269
Now what do you think of me?

891
01:19:12,229 --> 01:19:16,830
Now I don't think anymore, I'm in love.

892
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:36,550
- Do you really love me?
- Of course, I love you.

893
01:21:13,433 --> 01:21:17,233
- Give me that car.
- Give it to him, give it to him!

894
01:21:19,754 --> 01:21:22,194
You're not even rogues.

895
01:21:24,873 --> 01:21:27,073
You are just a bunch of idiots!

896
01:21:27,114 --> 01:21:31,154
Carlo, listen, I swear...
I didn't know anything about it!

897
01:21:31,193 --> 01:21:33,994
You are worth even less than them!

898
01:21:36,314 --> 01:21:39,034
What the fuck did you do
with this little car?

899
01:21:39,514 --> 01:21:43,354
Dear Fellow Citizens
I bring you my greetings.

900
01:21:43,394 --> 01:21:47,154
In this solemn moment we let
nature envelop us...

901
01:21:47,195 --> 01:21:50,634
...in her embrace
of a loving mother.

902
01:21:51,035 --> 01:21:56,714
Let us pay homage to her by placing in the
earth this tender sapling...

903
01:21:56,755 --> 01:21:59,635
...symbol of our love
and our hope.

904
01:21:59,675 --> 01:22:03,995
This little tree will grow
and become a big tree...

905
01:22:04,035 --> 01:22:07,915
...reaching towards the sky
to thank the Lord.

906
01:22:10,235 --> 01:22:13,954
- Dean, to you.
- Me?

907
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:22,316
Italians, fellow citizens, policemen
urban, suburban, interurban.

908
01:22:22,355 --> 01:22:27,075
- The solemn hour is about to strike.
- It is late. - In fact, it has struck.

909
01:22:27,116 --> 01:22:31,876
Since it is late, I want to thank
our first citizen,

910
01:22:31,916 --> 01:22:34,595
Who gave this short speech.

911
01:22:34,636 --> 01:22:39,596
- But if he's been talking for three hours.
- Short as in "brevi manu".

912
01:22:39,635 --> 01:22:42,676
- You're fine.
- What did you say? - Go on.

913
01:22:42,716 --> 01:22:47,116
Don't call me "sir" or I'll break your...
your knees! Give me that.

914
01:22:47,455 --> 01:22:49,396
Here, damn you!

915
01:22:49,436 --> 01:22:54,156
- Professors, let's continue.
- Look what he did to me!

916
01:22:54,476 --> 01:22:56,556
One, two...go!

917
01:23:04,036 --> 01:23:06,037
Up, up!

918
01:23:06,997 --> 01:23:08,996
Come on, come on!

919
01:23:17,557 --> 01:23:20,397
Bravo, you have made "bora-bora"!

920
01:23:32,277 --> 01:23:35,278
Stro...stro...assholes!

921
01:23:35,317 --> 01:23:40,198
- Irma, have you seen Paoletto? - No, I haven't.
- Professor, have you seen him?

922
01:23:40,237 --> 01:23:44,838
- Who is Paoletto? That head
of f... f... - What does he mean?

923
01:23:44,878 --> 01:23:51,278
Of dear child ... I haven't seen him.
I'm busy. Get off, get off!

924
01:24:04,158 --> 01:24:07,838
- Do you want to take over?
- I have to keep the tree.

925
01:24:07,878 --> 01:24:09,958
Did they take me for the Duce?

926
01:24:15,879 --> 01:24:20,399
Friends, I tell you
with sincerity, it was hard....

927
01:24:20,438 --> 01:24:23,758
...But I feel proud and happy.

928
01:24:23,799 --> 01:24:28,199
From today, thanks to me, in this
garden, in this city...

929
01:24:28,238 --> 01:24:30,239
...there's an extra tree.

930
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:35,119
Mom, did you see that? It was me.

931
01:24:35,159 --> 01:24:38,999
I can't put you through,
Nicolino, he's taking the orals.

932
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:42,079
- Morning.
- What do you want, "crustacean"? - To whom?

933
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:46,480
Not to you, Nicolino, to a cursed
janitor who haunts me.

934
01:24:46,519 --> 01:24:51,039
- If you want, I'll have him transferred.
- No, why get him transferred?

935
01:24:51,079 --> 01:24:56,320
Salvatore is a good person.
If not, who do I vent to?

936
01:24:56,359 --> 01:25:01,400
- Do you think Angela will do well
in the exams? - Of course!

937
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:06,000
- Then, with the arguments you have....
- If anything, mention my name.

938
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,600
They wipe their asses with it. Hi.

939
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:13,080
Thank you, Mr. Principal,
for not making me transfer.

940
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:16,840
When I become a band director
of band, who do I take it out on?

941
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:21,600
You will play in my band
a little triangle this small.

942
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:26,081
Every time you make a mistake, I'll say:
"Savior, you hit the wrong note!"

943
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:30,160
Then I will spit in your eye.
You just have to obey me.

944
01:25:30,201 --> 01:25:34,080
- If I say stay, stay. If I say
to go, go. Now go. - Where?

945
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:38,521
- Usual place. - Doing
cleaning? - To fuck off.

946
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:43,401
- Hi.
- Mr. Principal... - Go away!

947
01:25:43,441 --> 01:25:47,241
- I wanted to say.
- Go away, damn you! - But...

948
01:25:47,721 --> 01:25:53,761
D'Annunzio is the Boccaccio part
of Yung's ideal man...

949
01:25:53,801 --> 01:25:57,681
...also because, besides being
a whoremonger, he was also a fag.

950
01:25:57,721 --> 01:26:01,362
- Really? Active or passive?
- I'll tell you.

951
01:26:01,401 --> 01:26:05,281
If you prefer,
active, passive, and deponent.

952
01:26:05,322 --> 01:26:09,722
- It has a particular development.
- Yes, on two parallel fronts.

953
01:26:10,321 --> 01:26:17,802
So, Leibniz was saying....
So, Leibniz said that...

954
01:26:18,962 --> 01:26:23,282
- So do you remember what it said?
- It said.

955
01:26:23,322 --> 01:26:26,562
- "Monads don't have windows. "
- He said.

956
01:26:26,602 --> 01:26:28,602
"Nuns don't have windows."

957
01:26:29,562 --> 01:26:34,362
- Of course, they are cloistered nuns.
Go. - Dad, what the fuck are you talking about?

958
01:26:34,403 --> 01:26:38,322
- See you next year.
- I'm sorry, but I had to do it.

959
01:26:38,363 --> 01:26:40,882
For goodness sake, if it takes it takes it.

960
01:26:42,402 --> 01:26:46,402
I'm sorry, but I wanted to.
I'll break your feet at home.

961
01:26:49,723 --> 01:26:55,763
- So? - They screwed me too.
- Thank God, I thought you were cheating on us!

962
01:26:58,043 --> 01:27:00,923
Do you feel prepared, young lady?

963
01:27:01,603 --> 01:27:06,883
- Not too much. - She's my granddaughter.
- Let's talk a little history?

964
01:27:06,924 --> 01:27:12,124
- Whatever. - We ask you
something very simple.

965
01:27:12,404 --> 01:27:15,804
Let's talk about the figure of Napoleon.

966
01:27:17,484 --> 01:27:22,323
- What was Napoleon like?
- He was mean and stubborn.

967
01:27:23,163 --> 01:27:27,684
- He had two big green eyes,
he was handsome and very tall. - Excuse me?

968
01:27:27,724 --> 01:27:34,084
It refers to the photos we have
seen of Napoleon as a child.

969
01:27:34,124 --> 01:27:39,124
It was super tall and slender,
then over time it got shorter.

970
01:27:39,165 --> 01:27:43,364
In Corsica he trotted. Twice
in the dust, then in the earth...

971
01:27:43,405 --> 01:27:46,484
- That's a cute one!
- Yes, it's good.

972
01:27:46,524 --> 01:27:50,764
- Miss, what do you know about philosophy?
- That I think, therefore I exist.

973
01:27:50,805 --> 01:27:56,525
Thinking is not enough,
you also have to think and want.

974
01:27:56,565 --> 01:28:00,805
- You have to plan for the future.
- Have you planned yours?

975
01:28:00,845 --> 01:28:03,285
Miss, I'll ask the questions.

976
01:28:03,324 --> 01:28:07,925
Does it proceed or does it withdraw? In that case
see you next year.

977
01:28:07,965 --> 01:28:12,245
- It will be difficult, because I'm already
two months pregnant. - Huh?!

978
01:28:12,285 --> 01:28:14,805
Professor!

979
01:28:14,845 --> 01:28:19,486
- You mean that time,
at the sea... - Yes, Dad.

980
01:28:21,126 --> 01:28:25,086
Tombola, quaterna and cinquina.
Now that's some serious shit.

981
01:28:25,125 --> 01:28:30,566
Mr. Principal, this gives me the
cue to make the new march....

982
01:28:32,606 --> 01:28:36,245
Damn you, walk! Sorry.
See if you like this one.

983
01:28:40,286 --> 01:28:44,406
Go, damn you! He's a wretch
who wants to run the band.

984
01:28:46,106 --> 01:28:48,006
Get out!
