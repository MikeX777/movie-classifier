1
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:12,180
Turn off your motor.

2
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:16,454
Hold the light up in those trees.

3
00:01:21,628 --> 00:01:24,597
We'll get them
before they leave the island.

4
00:01:39,646 --> 00:01:43,776
- Lavond, my friend, will we make it?
- Yes.

5
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,650
The dogs lost our scent
when we crossed that river. Come on.

6
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:51,714
Yes, I've work to do.
I've dreamt only of my work.

7
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:55,990
Well, my work is no dream.
I've been awake for 17 years.

8
00:01:56,062 --> 00:02:01,022
But you have only hatred in your heart.
My work will help the worid to live.

9
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:04,093
My work will help three men die.

10
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:33,831
What is it, Prince?

11
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,494
What're you trying to tell me?
What's wrong?

12
00:02:41,908 --> 00:02:44,433
Lachna. Go away. Go away, Prince.

13
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:46,672
Lachna, Lachna,
see what's wrong with the dogs.

14
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:58,350
It's Marcel, my husband!

15
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:01,451
Call off the dogs, Lachna.
Call off the dogs, quickly!

16
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:07,426
Come here, Prince. Quickly!

17
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,833
Go to the shed. Go to the shed.

18
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,868
- Here. Help me.
- We're safe.

19
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:16,136
Easy now. Easy, old friend. Come along.

20
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,743
Marcel.

21
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:26,012
- Marcel, my husband.
- Malita.

22
00:03:29,089 --> 00:03:30,716
So you've come.

23
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:33,649
How did you get here?
Did they pardon you?

24
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:36,753
- We escaped.
- But the police. They'll be following you.

25
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,527
No. They lost our trail, weeks ago.

26
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:42,395
Come, let's get inside.

27
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:49,968
Malita, I knew you'd come here
as we planned.

28
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:53,206
I knew you'd be waiting.

29
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:58,143
Oh, Marcel. Marcel.

30
00:03:58,218 --> 00:04:02,382
You've been working.
I knew it by the howling of the dogs.

31
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,420
But you've failed, you've failed again.
I can see it in your face.

32
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:12,659
<i>Now, now, don't excite yourself, Marcel.
He's weak, madame.</i>

33
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:15,360
- He's been ill a long time.
- Who is he? Is he...

34
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:17,130
I know our mistake now.

35
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,601
It came to me one night
in that cesspool of stupid minds.

36
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:23,802
- Marcel. Marcel.
- No more failures, Malita.

37
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:28,413
The next one will have a perfect brain.

38
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:29,675
Marcel.

39
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:32,014
But we're not alone.

40
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:36,146
Oh, Paul.

41
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:41,057
<i>- Malita, this is my friend, Paul Lavond.
- Madame.</i>

42
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:42,818
We escaped together.

43
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:46,726
<i>- He saved my life more than once.
- I am grateful, monsieur.</i>

44
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:49,629
We need have no secrets from him.

45
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,905
Now, Malita, where are they?

46
00:04:53,707 --> 00:04:58,474
- I've thought, I've planned so long.
- They're in the next room.

47
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:03,712
Malita, help me. Help me.

48
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:09,518
Malita, shut off the tanks.

49
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:11,849
No.

50
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:14,357
No.

51
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:16,995
No.

52
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:20,333
Malita, some of the others, quick.

53
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:29,398
Careful. Careful, Marcel,
you might hurt them.

54
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:31,967
No. Just as I thought.

55
00:05:32,946 --> 00:05:34,379
They're all alike.

56
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:37,414
They might as well
not have any brain at all!

57
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:38,610
What is it?

58
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:43,088
Is this the great work you've been
dreaming of so long? Toy dogs?

59
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:44,248
Toy?

60
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:49,258
Forgive me, Lavond. Have you been
locked away from life so long

61
00:05:49,596 --> 00:05:52,861
you don't recognize
a prisoner of life itself?

62
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,968
Why, it feels warm.

63
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:02,871
Almost flesh and bone.

64
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:07,476
- Like the real animal.
- It is.

65
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:11,274
Eight hours ago
it was a full-grown Saint Bernard.

66
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:17,283
You think I'm mad.

67
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:22,792
The worid would think so, too,
if they knew what I was going to do.

68
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,294
Lavond, my friend, millions of years ago

69
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:31,101
the creatures that roamed
this worid were gigantic.

70
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:32,604
As they multiplied,

71
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:35,539
the earth could no longer
produce enough food.

72
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:39,106
Think of it, Lavond, every living creature

73
00:06:40,246 --> 00:06:45,081
reduced to one-sixth its size,
one-sixth its physical need!

74
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:47,919
Food for six times all of us!

75
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:51,783
Lavond, you know that all matter
is composed of atoms?

76
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:55,055
- Yes, yes, of course, I know.
- And all atoms are made of electrons.

77
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:57,756
- Yes, I know.
- Well, I've found a way

78
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:01,267
to reduce all atoms
in a body simultaneously

79
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:05,634
to any desired degree and still
maintain life, as in this little dog.

80
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:08,037
Well, then, the dog should be alive.

81
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:12,067
It is! It is. Only, in reducing the brain,

82
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,271
all records are wiped off, no memory left,

83
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:17,941
no will of its own.

84
00:07:18,017 --> 00:07:22,852
A creature capable of responding only
to the force of another will.

85
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,550
Malita, place it on the table.

86
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:30,695
Now, watch.

87
00:07:41,674 --> 00:07:44,541
Malita, a piece of bread.

88
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:51,778
Lavond, watch the others.

89
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:54,114
Watch them.

90
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:15,003
See, Lavond, only a few crumbs
is all they need.

91
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:28,585
Napoleon, Napoleon.
Get down. Get down. Get down.

92
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:30,788
That's a nice dog.

93
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:32,651
See, Paul? See?

94
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:35,660
Look! Look, look,
the little ones are falling down.

95
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:37,855
Naturally, I stopped concentrating.

96
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:42,194
- I broke the beam of thought.
- No man can do this.

97
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:44,634
But I did. You saw me do it.

98
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:49,040
But tonight, my friend,
I'll show you a complete success.

99
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:54,477
A little dog this high,
but perfect with an active brain.

100
00:08:55,048 --> 00:08:59,576
- Malita, get the big dog.
- No, no, Marcel, not now.

101
00:08:59,652 --> 00:09:02,382
- Rest.
- Rest? How can I rest? I tell you...

102
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:05,049
Oh, you've done enough tonight.
Have you any brandy?

103
00:09:05,124 --> 00:09:06,751
- Yes.
- Come along.

104
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:12,560
Lachna, get some brandy, quick. Quick.

105
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:15,427
Prince, Prince, go upstairs. Go.

106
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:21,839
Brandy, brandy, you moron.

107
00:09:23,776 --> 00:09:28,736
Now some hot broth. Hot broth!
What use are you? Go!

108
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:35,879
Malita, where did you get her?

109
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:38,224
In a Berlin slum.

110
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:43,228
She's an inbred peasant half-wit,
but I wanted no prying wits about me.

111
00:09:43,563 --> 00:09:45,724
Did anyone know she came with you?

112
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:49,497
No, Marcel, no one knows.

113
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:59,310
A friend of Marcel's is a welcome guest.

114
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,977
I hope you can stay with us a long time.

115
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:06,951
You'll be safe here.
And you can help us with our work.

116
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,820
<i>Oh, thank you very much, madame,
but I'm afraid that'll be impossible.</i>

117
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,120
I have work to attend to myself.

118
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:17,988
You see, when a man saves an ambition
in a dirty dungeon

119
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:20,259
for 17 years,

120
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,894
it becomes almost an insane obsessiÃ³n.

121
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,532
Well, with Marcel it was science,
with me it was hate.

122
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:30,470
Hate and vengeance.

123
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:37,849
<i>I may not look it, madame,
but I was once a very successful banker.</i>

124
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:43,419
Three men, my partners,
lied and tricked me into prison.

125
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:46,685
Well, three lives are going to pay for it.

126
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:50,855
Well, now you know why I can't
take advantage of your hospitality.

127
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:53,657
I'm leaving for Paris and tomorrow.

128
00:10:53,733 --> 00:10:57,362
- Malita.
- Yes, Marcel. I'm coming.

129
00:10:58,338 --> 00:10:59,669
<i>Madame.</i>

130
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:30,064
Marcel, please, that's all you can do now.
You must sleep.

131
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:34,232
No. No, I must see it through, every detail.

132
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:47,075
You've corrected her brain, Marcel.

133
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,788
She's no longer the stupid half-wit.

134
00:11:51,224 --> 00:11:55,126
She's going to be beautiful.
That's it, Lachna.

135
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:57,059
Straighten out.

136
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:06,365
Malita, turn on the tanks.

137
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,011
Wait! This is wrong.

138
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:17,211
Why? She'll be perfect.

139
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:20,582
Perfection isn't wrong. Think of it, Lavond.

140
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:24,646
A human being so high
with a perfect brain.

141
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,597
Malita, the mist.

142
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:44,269
Lavond, tonight, out of this mist,

143
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:47,208
you will see the birth of a new mankind,

144
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,747
in full control of its destiny.

145
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:19,910
In just a few seconds, Lavond,
just a few seconds, she'll awaken.

146
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:44,528
Marcel. Marcel!

147
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:53,542
Marcel. Marcel. Speak to me! Marcel!

148
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:00,783
Marcel, he's dead.

149
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,184
Poor tortured brain.

150
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:05,616
Perhaps it's all for the best, Malita.

151
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:08,489
But our work, our work, we must carry on!

152
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:12,562
- But this is murder.
- No, no.

153
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:15,263
No, she's not dead.

154
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:18,296
You must help me.
Marcel would want you to.

155
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:21,966
You must stay here. Quick, quick, help me.

156
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:28,709
Some cotton. Cotton.

157
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:52,636
Now, you concentrate.
She will respond to your will.

158
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,710
It's like some horrible dream.
I don't want any part of this.

159
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:11,482
- Restore her to what she was.
- No.

160
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:15,118
She will always remain small, small.

161
00:15:15,228 --> 00:15:19,824
We can make the whole worid small
as Marcel wanted to do.

162
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:22,793
We can go to Paris.

163
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:27,131
There are many people there.

164
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:32,439
There's where we begin our work.

165
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:34,376
Yes, Malita.

166
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:51,829
<i>- Yes?
- Matin.</i>

167
00:15:51,897 --> 00:15:54,764
<i>- Are you busy?
- Yes, very busy.</i>

168
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:57,132
<i>Well, this is more important
than anything else.</i>

169
00:15:57,203 --> 00:15:59,865
<i>- Come in right away.
- Oh, all right.</i>

170
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:04,008
Radin, this is terrible.

171
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:07,443
Well, what's wrong now? Indigestion?

172
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,977
If you continue to crucify your stomach,
my dear Coulvet, you'II...

173
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:14,884
Listen to this. "In a sensational statement
by the Prefect of Police today,

174
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:17,650
"it was admitted that Paul Lavond,
former bank president,

175
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:20,248
"convicted of looting his own bank
and killing a watchman,

176
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:22,453
"escaped from prison four months ago.

177
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:24,996
"He had served 17 years of a life sentence.

178
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:27,931
"Police censorship had
withheld the news until..."

179
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:32,399
Well, what about it?

180
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:35,372
It was a pretty plot, Charles,
but I knew we'd never get away with it.

181
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:37,068
Victor, not so loud.

182
00:16:37,143 --> 00:16:40,010
- Don't shout it all over the bank.
- No, please.

183
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:43,943
After all, embezzlement and murder
are things we should keep to ourselves.

184
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:45,278
But you didn't have to kill that man, Emile.

185
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:46,409
Stop it!

186
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:49,420
- Keep your mouth closed.
- He'll come back to Paris, he'll talk.

187
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:52,423
You cringe and scream
like a woman, Victor.

188
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:56,188
No, my friends,
our former president may be honest,

189
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:59,728
but he'll never be so stupid
as to set foot again in France.

190
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,666
I'd sleep better
if I knew Lavond was back in prison.

191
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:05,600
A 50,000 franc reward would ensure that.

192
00:17:05,671 --> 00:17:09,971
There's a certain amusing irony in offering
a man's own money for his capture.

193
00:17:10,643 --> 00:17:14,204
50,000 francs? Why not?

194
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:17,946
Give me the Prefect of Police.

195
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:21,547
Instruct all divisions to restudy
the features of Paul Lavond

196
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,248
from the photograph issued,
and impress upon them

197
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:26,291
it was taken 17 years ago.

198
00:17:57,623 --> 00:18:01,059
My partners and I will increase
the reward to 100,000 francs.

199
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:48,232
- Malita.
- Yes, I'm coming, madam.

200
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:52,175
- Bring the... Oh, I see you have it.
- Yes, I have the bundle.

201
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:55,077
Come into the back room with me.

202
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,613
Look in the basket, Malita.

203
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:10,061
100,000 francs reward for my capture.

204
00:19:10,863 --> 00:19:14,060
Who do you think
is offering all this money for me?

205
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:17,858
The same three swine
that sent me to prison before.

206
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:20,898
They're frightened to death, Malita.

207
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:24,799
They know that my freedom
means they're finished.

208
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:28,973
But what they don't know is
the Paul Lavond they're looking for

209
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:33,747
<i>is Madame Mandilip,
a poor, tottering old woman.</i>

210
00:19:34,854 --> 00:19:37,049
Yes. Very nice.

211
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,514
Beautifully constructed.

212
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:41,417
<i>But, madame, the bank
would not be interested</i>

213
00:19:41,494 --> 00:19:43,758
in financing the manufacture of toys.

214
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:47,629
<i>But, monsieur, I thought
that possibly if not the bank,</i>

215
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,032
that you personally might do it.

216
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:53,128
No, there are so many novelties
like this on the market now.

217
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:57,107
But a toy like this
has never been made before.

218
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:59,701
It's not mechanical and yet,

219
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:03,009
if you speak to it, it will obey you.

220
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:05,744
- Obey?
- Yes.

221
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:07,976
Ask it to do something.

222
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:12,621
- Do something?
- Yes. Give it an order.

223
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:17,858
Get up on your feet.

224
00:20:24,136 --> 00:20:25,535
Walk around.

225
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:32,767
Faster. Faster!

226
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:45,655
That's amazing!
It didn't move like a mechanical toy.

227
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:47,655
<i>How do you do that, madame?</i>

228
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,024
<i>That's my little secret, monsieur.</i>

229
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:54,389
What capital would you require?

230
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,661
To start with, just a few thousand francs.

231
00:20:59,171 --> 00:21:02,004
Well, I'll think it over.
Get in touch with me later.

232
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:07,607
<i>But, monsieur, I want
to start manufacturing at once.</i>

233
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,649
The Christmas holidays are so close.

234
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:12,980
<i>Naturally, madame,
I shall have to investigate further</i>

235
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:14,383
before I advance any money.

236
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:17,684
Of course. Of course.

237
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:22,159
I'd expect you to come to my shop
and go into every detail.

238
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:25,528
- When could you come?
- How about tonight?

239
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:27,861
- Say, 8:00?
- Splendid.

240
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:31,364
My little shop is in Montmartre.

241
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:33,937
It's rather difficult to find.

242
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:38,234
I'll meet you by the Moulin Rouge at 8:00.

243
00:21:39,845 --> 00:21:41,312
<i>Good day, monsieur.</i>

244
00:21:42,514 --> 00:21:45,142
But remember, I'm making no promises.

245
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:47,976
You don't have to.

246
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,914
Once you're in my shop,
I'll wager you'll do anything I ask.

247
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:02,797
Well, I can hardly believe it.

248
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:07,495
I feel like pinching myself to see
if I'm awake or dreaming.

249
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:11,333
To think that I really have you here.

250
00:22:12,645 --> 00:22:17,105
I mean, that you're going
to be my partner and help me.

251
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:19,878
Yes, but remember if I do,
it'll only be financially.

252
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:23,911
- My name must not appear.
- I wouldn't dream of using your name.

253
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:27,592
You'll just be my silent partner.

254
00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:31,720
My workshop is downstairs. Follow me.

255
00:22:31,797 --> 00:22:33,924
Be careful. It's very steep.

256
00:22:36,835 --> 00:22:40,737
Now, this is the room
where we keep all our little secrets.

257
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,470
<i>Make yourself comfortable, monsieur.</i>

258
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:44,804
May I take your coat?

259
00:22:44,877 --> 00:22:47,277
No, no, no, it isn't necessary.
I'll just keep it on.

260
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:49,380
Please be seated.

261
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:53,775
<i>- Malita.
- Yes, madame.</i>

262
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:57,015
Come here, please.

263
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,554
<i>This is Monsieur Radin,
the banker I spoke to you about.</i>

264
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:07,559
<i>- This is Madame Malita, my assistant.
- Monsieur.</i>

265
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:10,827
<i>Is everything ready for Monsieur Radin?</i>

266
00:23:10,903 --> 00:23:14,339
<i>- Yes, madame.
- Splendid. Splendid.</i>

267
00:23:14,406 --> 00:23:15,839
Some cognac.

268
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:20,103
<i>Sit down. Sit down, monsieur. Excuse me.</i>

269
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:24,309
- No cognac, please.
- No cognac?

270
00:23:24,383 --> 00:23:25,748
No, thank you.

271
00:23:28,954 --> 00:23:31,923
<i>- Won't you have some cognac, monsieur?
- No, no, thank you.</i>

272
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:34,625
Here's another of our little pets.

273
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:40,398
Most ingenious.

274
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:45,326
- It is lifelike, isn't it?
- Isn't it though?

275
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:47,636
<i>But, monsieur,</i>

276
00:23:48,073 --> 00:23:51,236
you see that little doll sitting over there
on the block?

277
00:23:51,944 --> 00:23:55,038
That's Lachna, our apache doll.

278
00:23:56,315 --> 00:23:59,944
Malita, will you please
bring me the little stiletto?

279
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:04,516
All our accessories are carried out

280
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:08,158
down to the most minute detail.

281
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:14,021
For example, on our ponies,
the harness is exact.

282
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:19,295
And on our little dogs,
the collars are all different,

283
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:22,932
but mind you, suitable to the breed.

284
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:26,074
Thank you, Malita.

285
00:24:26,378 --> 00:24:28,608
And our apache dolls

286
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,446
we supply with a dinky little stiletto.

287
00:24:35,654 --> 00:24:39,715
Why, this is
an authentic little replica itself.

288
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,353
Isn't it?

289
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:43,387
Isn't it?

290
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:56,134
Don't be too alarmed, Radin.
You're not dying.

291
00:24:56,575 --> 00:25:00,033
Oh, I see you recognize my voice.

292
00:25:01,046 --> 00:25:03,344
That's one of the few things that you

293
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:06,907
and Coulvet and Matin
didn't steal from me.

294
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,184
Another is my hatred.

295
00:25:10,956 --> 00:25:15,791
Look at me and see what 17 years
in the grave has done to me.

296
00:25:16,862 --> 00:25:20,195
No, Radin, without my hatred,

297
00:25:20,265 --> 00:25:23,792
I never could have lived to exhume myself.

298
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:28,304
What swine you three are.

299
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:33,507
You're going to help me
to recover what I can from life.

300
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,171
That's why you're not going to die.

301
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:43,377
No, I wouldn't let you die
for the worid, Radin.

302
00:25:52,531 --> 00:25:53,896
The police.

303
00:25:57,236 --> 00:25:59,636
<i>One moment, monsieur.
Madame will be with you.</i>

304
00:26:07,312 --> 00:26:11,442
We must finish painting
those soldiers of the legion, Malita.

305
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:14,279
And we have 10 dolls to dress.

306
00:26:15,787 --> 00:26:18,153
<i>- Good evening, monsieur.
- Good evening, madame.</i>

307
00:26:18,223 --> 00:26:21,283
- Can I show you something special?
- No, thank you.

308
00:26:21,627 --> 00:26:25,893
But your glue pots in the alley,
the neighbors are complaining again.

309
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:31,199
I'm so sorry, of course. How stupid of me.

310
00:26:31,937 --> 00:26:34,906
<i>But the holiday rush, monsieur,
I quite forgot.</i>

311
00:26:35,173 --> 00:26:38,074
I assure you I shall hang them inside.

312
00:26:38,143 --> 00:26:40,543
<i>- Fine. Do so.
- I will, monsieur.</i>

313
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:43,103
<i>Well, good day and good luck, madame.</i>

314
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:46,642
<i>I'm amazed at my good luck, monsieur.</i>

315
00:26:50,555 --> 00:26:53,183
Amazed is the word, eh, Malita?

316
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,595
Stupid policeman, to let an old white wig

317
00:26:57,663 --> 00:27:00,427
cost him 100,000 francs.

318
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:04,898
It might have been safer to
take him downstairs and make him small.

319
00:27:05,037 --> 00:27:07,665
He's small already in mind.

320
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:13,233
In fact, Malita, if most men were reduced
to the dimensions of their mentality,

321
00:27:13,312 --> 00:27:15,872
Marcel's plan wouldn't be necessary.

322
00:27:15,948 --> 00:27:18,815
But we're pledged to it, aren't we?
We have sworn.

323
00:27:18,884 --> 00:27:22,479
Calm yourself, Malita.
Let me make the plans.

324
00:27:22,554 --> 00:27:23,612
Where are you going?

325
00:27:23,689 --> 00:27:26,089
To your mother's again
where the police are always watching?

326
00:27:26,158 --> 00:27:29,650
No. I'm going to see my daughter.

327
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:33,056
It's the one thrill life has left me.

328
00:27:33,732 --> 00:27:37,725
I love to look at her, to listen to her talk.

329
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,670
It drives me almost crazy though, Malita,

330
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:44,698
not to be able to take her
in my arms and tell her who I am.

331
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:47,244
Why don't you bring the little girl here?

332
00:27:47,446 --> 00:27:50,313
Why, I couldn't tell her who I am.

333
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:53,579
Why, she's grown
to hate her father's memory.

334
00:27:53,952 --> 00:27:55,180
I...

335
00:27:56,488 --> 00:27:58,479
I'll not be long, Malita.

336
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:09,733
It's 5:00.
How many more pieces have you got?

337
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:11,860
- Three or four.
- Well, hurry up.

338
00:28:13,905 --> 00:28:16,100
It's amazing the way
you washed-out Cinderellas

339
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:19,166
can speed up work
when 5:00 comes around.

340
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,110
Are we whacking shirts
on the shore of a stream?

341
00:28:25,017 --> 00:28:29,044
Look at this water, too much soap.
All my profits.

342
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:32,847
Maizie, come here.
What's that dream on your face?

343
00:28:32,924 --> 00:28:35,449
A rendezvous with
that scoundrel of yours I suppose?

344
00:28:35,527 --> 00:28:38,223
Well, you'll catch this fish first
and these along with it

345
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:40,526
since you're so stored up for bait.

346
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:44,364
Oh, good evening.
Lorraine, take care of the customer.

347
00:28:46,605 --> 00:28:49,506
<i>- Good evening, madame.
- Good evening, my dear.</i>

348
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:51,699
Why, you seem very tired.

349
00:28:51,777 --> 00:28:55,269
Oh, no. I was just rushing
to finish my tub on time.

350
00:28:56,114 --> 00:28:57,877
How soon do you want this?

351
00:29:03,188 --> 00:29:04,450
Tomorrow?

352
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:08,753
No, no, my dear. The end
of the week will be plenty of time.

353
00:29:08,827 --> 00:29:09,953
Oh, fine.

354
00:29:10,028 --> 00:29:14,055
One skirt. Three blouses.

355
00:29:20,572 --> 00:29:25,305
Your hands seem chapped.
You should put lotion on them.

356
00:29:25,744 --> 00:29:28,212
I know one of the very finest...

357
00:29:30,315 --> 00:29:32,215
Toto has a new taxi.

358
00:29:35,187 --> 00:29:38,418
<i>- Mademoiselle Lavond, I believe.
- Yes, Toto?</i>

359
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:42,824
I bring you the honor of driving home in
the Fortuna Taxi Company's third vehicle

360
00:29:42,894 --> 00:29:45,294
on which I have just paid
the first installment.

361
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:48,764
- Is the second paid for yet?
- An insidious detail.

362
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:52,167
We capitalists must take risks.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

363
00:29:52,237 --> 00:29:54,933
<i>- Right, Madame Mandilip?
- Absolutely.</i>

364
00:29:55,507 --> 00:29:58,271
<i>You see, Madame Mandilip
understands economics.</i>

365
00:29:58,343 --> 00:30:01,403
Oh, here you are, my pet.
Give this number to your suitors.

366
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,311
Reliable service day and night.

367
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:06,817
No rear sight mirrors,
free parking time in the Bois.

368
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:09,750
I hear your grandmother is ill, my dear.

369
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:12,051
I should so like to pay a call on her.

370
00:30:12,124 --> 00:30:14,888
Oh, it's just the weather, I think.
It's been so cold and damp.

371
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,656
Yes. I feel quite ashamed of myself

372
00:30:17,863 --> 00:30:22,823
for not having called before, but
I've been so busy getting my shop ready.

373
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,930
Well, I must be going now.

374
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,739
Good day, my dear.

375
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,878
<i>- Goodbye, madame.
- Good day.</i>

376
00:30:33,945 --> 00:30:37,437
<i>Here you are, madame. It's nice to know
a reliable firm when you need a taxi.</i>

377
00:30:37,516 --> 00:30:40,349
Yes, indeed. And thanks.

378
00:30:40,418 --> 00:30:43,251
You have my best wishes
in your new venture.

379
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:45,448
Thanks, and the same to you.

380
00:30:47,526 --> 00:30:51,121
Never overlook a chance
to improve business. That's my motto.

381
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,828
- What's the matter?
- That woman.

382
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:55,457
<i>- Madame Mandilip?
- Yes.</i>

383
00:30:55,534 --> 00:30:59,231
She's somehow pathetic and kind.
She almost makes me want to cry.

384
00:30:59,304 --> 00:31:02,000
Look, I feel just the opposite
from that right now.

385
00:31:02,073 --> 00:31:04,064
Will you be the first fare in my third taxi?

386
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:07,236
I'd love to. If you'll give me
just three minutes to finish my tub.

387
00:31:07,312 --> 00:31:09,940
In three minutes, Dame Fortune the Third
will be at your service.

388
00:31:10,015 --> 00:31:11,107
All right.

389
00:31:16,054 --> 00:31:18,716
- Do you like her?
- Oh, she's lovely.

390
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:23,051
<i>Get inside, mademoiselle.</i>

391
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:34,071
Do we have to go up in the tower to talk?

392
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:36,564
Was love ever so humiliated?

393
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:40,133
Here I am taking you up near heaven
where all angels belong

394
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:42,369
- and you protest.
- Toto.

395
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:47,074
Watch your hats.

396
00:31:48,653 --> 00:31:50,018
Going down!

397
00:31:51,656 --> 00:31:53,647
Toto, really,
why did you bring me up here?

398
00:31:53,725 --> 00:31:54,817
Don't you remember?

399
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:57,691
This is where I first gave you
complete ownership of myself

400
00:31:57,762 --> 00:32:00,322
and a half interest
in the Fortuna Taxi Company.

401
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,427
- There was only one taxi then, remember?
- Yes.

402
00:32:03,501 --> 00:32:05,560
It was April and we could smell
the chestnut blossoms

403
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:08,162
all the way from the Bois. It was so...

404
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:22,346
I told you then how I felt about things

405
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,082
and that you shouldn't
waste your time on me.

406
00:32:26,524 --> 00:32:29,584
It's grand to be up here
when your thoughts are all jumbled.

407
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:31,227
Don't things look different?

408
00:32:31,296 --> 00:32:34,356
Everything seems so small
and unimportant from up here.

409
00:32:35,133 --> 00:32:37,124
But I don't live up here.

410
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:41,472
I live down there.

411
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,204
Our worid's what we make it, Lorraine.

412
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:48,045
You know, you're not making
the best of yours.

413
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:52,344
- I make it as I see it.
- Yes, I know.

414
00:32:52,484 --> 00:32:54,247
But you're too sensitive.

415
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:56,419
It hasn't been pleasant, Toto,

416
00:32:56,488 --> 00:32:59,889
to be pointed at, singled out,
despised as the daughter of a...

417
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:03,586
It does something to you
when you're very young.

418
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:07,564
Something that grows up with you.
It got so that I hated to go to school.

419
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:10,601
- Hated even to... To leave the house.
- Yes.

420
00:33:10,802 --> 00:33:12,827
Kids can be pretty brutal, can't they?

421
00:33:12,904 --> 00:33:15,338
And now since the escape,
it's started all over again.

422
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:19,366
Pictures in the paper, our movements
watched, people whispering.

423
00:33:19,444 --> 00:33:21,935
Oh, don't let that get you, darling.
You're above all that.

424
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:26,143
- Do you wonder that I hate him?
- Don't hate, Lorraine.

425
00:33:26,217 --> 00:33:28,777
Oh, not for what he's done to me,
but to my mother.

426
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:31,549
The mental torture,
the poverty he brought her.

427
00:33:33,058 --> 00:33:37,051
Toto, I think I should tell you the truth.

428
00:33:37,796 --> 00:33:39,525
My mother didn't just die.

429
00:33:40,332 --> 00:33:43,790
- She killed herself.
- Yes. I know.

430
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:46,737
And even that
doesn't make any difference?

431
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:49,539
Nothing could make any difference.

432
00:33:49,607 --> 00:33:53,099
But, Toto, I could never escape
from the fact that I'm his daughter.

433
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:55,669
I could never ask any man
to share that with me.

434
00:33:55,747 --> 00:33:59,308
Least of all you. I love you too much.

435
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,916
Toto, we'd better go.

436
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,092
You might as well kill a person
as frighten them to death.

437
00:34:11,763 --> 00:34:15,062
The frosty weather hasn't done
your flowers any good, has it?

438
00:34:15,133 --> 00:34:18,068
Those violets are rather pretty.
How much are they?

439
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:21,366
<i>One franc, madame.
They're unusually large this season.</i>

440
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:23,339
Yes. I'll take a bunch.

441
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:27,709
<i>- Thank you, madame.
- Madame.</i>

442
00:34:30,281 --> 00:34:32,249
Come, come. Move on. No loitering.

443
00:34:32,317 --> 00:34:35,912
I'm watching Lavond's mother's place.
We're certain he's in Paris.

444
00:34:49,434 --> 00:34:50,628
Yes?

445
00:34:51,302 --> 00:34:52,462
Come in.

446
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,103
Lorraine?

447
00:35:01,212 --> 00:35:03,373
- It's all right, Mother.
- Paul.

448
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:06,573
Much as I love you,
you mustn't come here anymore.

449
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:10,747
Ever since that first night, I've been
terrified that someone would suspect.

450
00:35:11,022 --> 00:35:13,354
<i>But there's no reason
why Madame Mandilip</i>

451
00:35:13,425 --> 00:35:15,586
shouldn't come and visit you.

452
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,993
Come along, Mother.
Sit down. Don't worry.

453
00:35:19,063 --> 00:35:21,088
You shouldn't come so late, Paul.

454
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:23,396
Lorraine will be home
from work any minute.

455
00:35:23,468 --> 00:35:25,629
That's just why I'm here.

456
00:35:25,703 --> 00:35:28,228
As a matter of fact, she knows I'm coming.

457
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:30,764
You've been talking to her?

458
00:35:30,842 --> 00:35:35,802
Yes. I saw her today
in that filthy laundry she's working in.

459
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:39,144
But you didn't tell her?
You didn't let her know who you were?

460
00:35:39,217 --> 00:35:43,153
No. Not yet. But I'm going to tonight.

461
00:35:43,288 --> 00:35:45,586
I can't stand it any longer.

462
00:35:45,957 --> 00:35:48,926
But she's so bitter, so resentful.

463
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:53,862
I know. Poor child.
But we can't blame her for that.

464
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,892
Those three swine.

465
00:35:56,968 --> 00:35:59,402
Paul, listen to me.

466
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:02,766
If you must tell her,

467
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:06,402
let me talk to her first, slowly, gradually.

468
00:36:07,078 --> 00:36:10,104
- It's so dangerous, Paul.
- Yes, I know, Mother.

469
00:36:12,617 --> 00:36:16,212
- Grandmother.
- It's Lorraine. Be careful.

470
00:36:18,723 --> 00:36:20,122
Grandmother!

471
00:36:20,925 --> 00:36:24,361
Why, what's... Oh, it's you. I thought
something had happened to Grandmother.

472
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:28,966
I'm so sorry. I'm used to locking my shop.
It was stupid of me.

473
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:31,194
I'm so glad. Come on and sit down.

474
00:36:31,269 --> 00:36:34,329
- Are you enjoying yourself, darling?
- Yes, dear.

475
00:36:34,405 --> 00:36:37,067
We've had a delightful little chat.

476
00:36:38,076 --> 00:36:40,044
Oh, how lovely.

477
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:42,978
Oh, that's sweet of you.
Violets are Grandmother's favorite flower.

478
00:36:43,047 --> 00:36:44,776
- Violets?
- Why, yes.

479
00:36:45,316 --> 00:36:47,614
I remember Mother telling how...

480
00:36:48,686 --> 00:36:50,620
I'll put them in water later.

481
00:36:50,688 --> 00:36:55,091
- What's the matter, darling? You cold?
- Just a little chilly.

482
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:57,491
Well, we'll have a blaze in just a moment.

483
00:36:57,896 --> 00:37:00,456
Not much firewood for a franc nowadays,
is there?

484
00:37:00,532 --> 00:37:02,227
Aren't prices awful?

485
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,736
My yard's just littered with packing cases.

486
00:37:05,803 --> 00:37:08,863
- You must let me send you some.
- Oh, no, we couldn't.

487
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,933
Well, why not?
I have to pay to have it carted away.

488
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:15,878
Well, in that case, we'd be very grateful.

489
00:37:20,218 --> 00:37:22,118
What a beautiful woman.

490
00:37:22,787 --> 00:37:24,846
Yes. That was my mother.

491
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:29,023
- This is a lovely rosary.
- It's mine.

492
00:37:29,093 --> 00:37:32,062
Yes, I know. I mean...

493
00:37:32,397 --> 00:37:34,160
I knew it must be.

494
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:37,966
I gave my little girl one just like it.

495
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:40,334
She was so proud of it.

496
00:37:40,672 --> 00:37:44,039
They tell me I was, too, when I got it.

497
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,339
Something happen
to change your feelings toward it?

498
00:37:49,414 --> 00:37:50,540
<i>Please, Madame Mandilip.</i>

499
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:53,140
I'm sure you know who we are
and all about us.

500
00:37:53,217 --> 00:37:57,278
The rosary was given to me by someone
whose name we never mention here.

501
00:37:58,022 --> 00:38:01,355
- Your father.
- I have no father.

502
00:38:01,693 --> 00:38:05,288
You're very young to be so bitter.

503
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:09,726
- Don't blame me. Blame him.
- Lorraine, your father was innocent.

504
00:38:09,801 --> 00:38:11,928
Yes, that's what I've heard all my life.

505
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:15,530
That's why they sent him to prison.
That's why my mother killed herself!

506
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:17,905
And that's why his mother
spends her old age this way,

507
00:38:17,976 --> 00:38:20,706
with barely enough food,
and firewood once a week a luxury!

508
00:38:20,778 --> 00:38:21,802
Please, please.

509
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,642
And do you know
how we get these great comforts?

510
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:26,582
Not from my work in the laundry.
That wouldn't keep us alive.

511
00:38:26,718 --> 00:38:30,518
No. All our great wealth comes
from the CafÃ© Poule down the street

512
00:38:30,588 --> 00:38:31,885
where I've the honor to work at night.

513
00:38:31,956 --> 00:38:34,789
Where I have the joy of letting a crowd
of sewer workers smirk at me

514
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:37,589
so they can buy more wine!
A centime a drink I get!

515
00:38:38,162 --> 00:38:39,424
Lorraine.

516
00:38:39,497 --> 00:38:41,465
It doesn't sound pretty, does it?
Well, it isn't!

517
00:38:41,532 --> 00:38:44,558
And Toto's eyes weren't nice to look at
when he held out his heart to me

518
00:38:44,636 --> 00:38:46,399
and I had to throw it back in his face!

519
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:49,167
That's what my father's done
and I loathe him for it!

520
00:38:53,678 --> 00:38:55,373
See who that is, please.

521
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:07,581
<i>- I wish to speak to Madame Lavond.
- Monsieur.</i>

522
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:18,034
<i>I'm from the Prefect of Police, madame.
We are still looking for your son.</i>

523
00:39:18,102 --> 00:39:19,569
Have you heard from him?

524
00:39:19,637 --> 00:39:22,834
<i>Madame Lavond was just speaking
of her boy.</i>

525
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:26,172
His escape has naturally
quite unnerved her.

526
00:39:26,244 --> 00:39:28,109
- Naturally.
- But I've not heard from him.

527
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:31,171
<i>- Not even by letter, monsieur.
- Lf you do, madame,</i>

528
00:39:31,249 --> 00:39:33,717
the Prefect will expect you
to notify him at once.

529
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:36,310
In the meantime,
I'll check with you each day.

530
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:39,217
You understand, of course,
harboring a criminal,

531
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,623
even though it be your son,
is a most serious offense.

532
00:39:42,694 --> 00:39:46,186
<i>You don't need to remind us of our duty
or of the law. Good day, monsieur.</i>

533
00:39:46,264 --> 00:39:48,357
<i>Good day, mademoiselle. Madame.</i>

534
00:39:56,641 --> 00:40:00,668
I know how you feel, my dear.
But don't blame them.

535
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:04,442
It's only natural for them
to expect him to come here.

536
00:40:04,515 --> 00:40:07,177
He hasn't seen you for so long.

537
00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:11,452
You must be prepared though.
He may come.

538
00:40:12,323 --> 00:40:13,847
I hope he doesn't.

539
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:17,456
Because if he does,
I'm going to turn him over to the police.

540
00:40:19,363 --> 00:40:23,322
Yes. Well, goodbye, my dear.

541
00:40:23,968 --> 00:40:27,165
Yes. Yes. I know, Inspector.

542
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:30,332
But it's been two days
since Radin disappeared.

543
00:40:30,908 --> 00:40:33,934
Yes. Yes, we'd appreciate it.

544
00:40:36,347 --> 00:40:38,542
Matin? I know it's Lavond.

545
00:40:39,183 --> 00:40:40,946
I'm going to ask for police protection.

546
00:40:41,018 --> 00:40:43,452
The less you have to do with police,
the better off we'll be.

547
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:46,422
Get hold of your nerves before you
say something you'll be sorry for.

548
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:48,857
- Oh, you needn't worry about me.
- I am.

549
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:51,451
You've got to get out of town.
Take a trip somewhere.

550
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:54,123
- But you know I can't with the holidays.
- Then keep your head.

551
00:40:54,198 --> 00:40:57,998
Or we'll both be taking a trip
at the expense of the government.

552
00:41:00,338 --> 00:41:01,532
I'll admit. I can't sleep.

553
00:41:01,606 --> 00:41:04,803
I keep wondering
which one of us he's going to look up next.

554
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:07,438
- Goodbye, Emile.
- Thanks for coming over.

555
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:08,774
Well, what do you want?

556
00:41:08,846 --> 00:41:12,475
<i>Your butler is showing Madame
one of my dolls, monsieur.</i>

557
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,018
<i>- Madame will see you.
- Thank you.</i>

558
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:18,187
Look at this doll, Emile. Isn't it clever?

559
00:41:18,256 --> 00:41:20,747
Oh, my dear Mathilde,
I've other things on my mind besides...

560
00:41:20,825 --> 00:41:23,191
And I do wish you wouldn't ask
every street peddler to...

561
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:24,387
<i>Madame.</i>

562
00:41:25,163 --> 00:41:28,758
<i>This is a most unusual doll, madame.
Have you any more like it?</i>

563
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:30,596
<i>Only one, madame.</i>

564
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:34,831
And unfortunately,
I've made it for another customer.

565
00:41:36,407 --> 00:41:40,707
They look so lifelike.
And it feels almost human.

566
00:41:40,912 --> 00:41:45,372
<i>- What's it made of?
- It's a secret process of my own, madame.</i>

567
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:48,781
Observe the detail of the features.

568
00:41:49,253 --> 00:41:51,585
See how the eyes sparkle.

569
00:41:51,856 --> 00:41:55,724
<i>The little lips look as if
they were going to speak to Madame.</i>

570
00:41:55,793 --> 00:41:58,591
- How much is it?
- 250 francs.

571
00:41:58,663 --> 00:42:01,860
250 francs! Ridiculous!

572
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:06,495
<i>Surely not to a gentleman
of Monsieur's exalted station.</i>

573
00:42:06,904 --> 00:42:10,067
<i>Or Madame with her exquisite jewels.</i>

574
00:42:11,175 --> 00:42:16,135
Would it be presumptuous if I asked
to look at that necklace a little closer?

575
00:42:16,214 --> 00:42:18,580
- Of course not.
- Thank you.

576
00:42:21,652 --> 00:42:25,213
Lovely. Very lovely.

577
00:42:25,456 --> 00:42:29,620
<i>Oh, forgive me, madame,
but I do love the beautiful.</i>

578
00:42:29,694 --> 00:42:32,686
You can tell that from my workmanship.

579
00:42:33,764 --> 00:42:38,701
<i>Monsieur, allow me to explain
to you about my little doll.</i>

580
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:42,666
If you'll examine it,
you'll see how lifelike it is.

581
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:47,336
- The hair is as natural as your own.
- All right, all right. I'll buy it.

582
00:42:47,411 --> 00:42:49,106
And now, my dear, let the woman go.

583
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:53,116
What are the squirrels going to do
with all the popcorn I gave them?

584
00:42:53,184 --> 00:42:54,879
Why, they're going
to keep it for the winter.

585
00:42:54,952 --> 00:42:57,045
Aren't they going to give the birdies any?

586
00:42:57,121 --> 00:43:00,147
No, they're going
to keep it all for themselves.

587
00:43:00,524 --> 00:43:03,049
<i>Thank you a thousand times, monsieur.</i>

588
00:43:03,361 --> 00:43:05,727
You'll never know how happy it makes me

589
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:09,061
to leave one of my dolls
in your beautiful home.

590
00:43:09,133 --> 00:43:12,125
Oh, Marguerite,
you would have to come in now.

591
00:43:12,203 --> 00:43:14,364
It was going to be a surprise.

592
00:43:15,206 --> 00:43:18,175
<i>Good day, madame. Good day, petite.</i>

593
00:43:18,242 --> 00:43:20,233
<i>- Good day.
- Monsieur.</i>

594
00:43:21,979 --> 00:43:26,040
- Emile? Emile, what's the matter?
- Matter?

595
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:29,443
Why, what do you mean?
Why, nothing's the matter.

596
00:49:34,652 --> 00:49:35,880
Emile.

597
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:44,921
Emile, what's the matter? Emile! Emile!

598
00:49:53,537 --> 00:49:55,198
Gentlemen, I'm ashamed of you.

599
00:49:55,272 --> 00:49:58,503
Two crimes have been committed
right under your very noses.

600
00:49:58,609 --> 00:50:01,601
Radin has disappeared,
Coulvet has been paralyzed.

601
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:05,479
Both these crimes point to the vengeance
of this escaped convict, Lavond.

602
00:50:05,549 --> 00:50:09,315
And you, my best men, can't offer me
a single clue as to his whereabouts.

603
00:50:09,386 --> 00:50:11,013
Have you lost your wits?

604
00:50:11,088 --> 00:50:13,648
And you, Maurice,
what's happened to you in this case?

605
00:50:13,724 --> 00:50:16,284
If you don't want
the reward offered for this criminal,

606
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,851
at least spare me this humiliation.

607
00:50:18,929 --> 00:50:23,389
Gentlemen, I want Paul Lavond
under arrest within 24 hours.

608
00:50:23,467 --> 00:50:24,559
Find him!

609
00:50:25,135 --> 00:50:27,626
"Police are baffled by what they consider

610
00:50:27,705 --> 00:50:32,301
<i>"a look of constant terror
in Monsieur Coulvet's expressiÃ³n."</i>

611
00:50:36,647 --> 00:50:40,674
There, Malita, is my proud friend, Coulvet.

612
00:50:40,951 --> 00:50:43,943
Taking up my sentence where I left off.

613
00:50:47,124 --> 00:50:49,319
Congratulations, Lachna.

614
00:50:49,927 --> 00:50:54,091
Splendid work.
I couldn't have done better myself.

615
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:14,281
Beautiful Green Sea Emerald.

616
00:51:14,518 --> 00:51:18,113
Well, little by little, I'll get you all back.

617
00:52:13,944 --> 00:52:15,241
Leave her alone!

618
00:52:22,586 --> 00:52:24,383
You fool!

619
00:52:24,721 --> 00:52:28,487
Why, you could have killed her.
You might have broken her neck.

620
00:52:33,363 --> 00:52:35,524
Poor little thing.

621
00:53:01,124 --> 00:53:04,184
I'm coming. I'll be right there.

622
00:53:04,528 --> 00:53:07,759
Shut off the music box. Clear off the table.

623
00:53:14,238 --> 00:53:17,537
<i>I'm sorry, monsieur.
I was in the rear of my shop.</i>

624
00:53:17,608 --> 00:53:20,133
- Shall we go upstairs?
- This'll do.

625
00:53:20,544 --> 00:53:22,808
<i>- Are you Madame Mandilip?
- Yes.</i>

626
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,781
- I'm from the police.
- Police?

627
00:53:26,016 --> 00:53:29,383
<i>Oh, come in, monsieur.</i>

628
00:53:31,955 --> 00:53:34,423
<i>- Won't you be seated, monsieur?
- No, thanks.</i>

629
00:53:34,491 --> 00:53:37,892
<i>We understand that you sold a doll
to Monsieur Coulvet yesterday.</i>

630
00:53:38,061 --> 00:53:42,998
Coulvet? Oh, yes, the gentleman
whose picture's here in the paper.

631
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,237
Such a shocking affair.
We've just been reading about it.

632
00:53:48,872 --> 00:53:52,808
Such a charming gentleman, so courteous.

633
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:56,207
<i>Madame Coulvet was wearing a necklace
that you admired.</i>

634
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,840
Yes. I did.

635
00:53:59,783 --> 00:54:04,049
It was so beautiful,
no one could help looking at it.

636
00:54:04,388 --> 00:54:08,791
It contained the Green Sea Emerald,
one of the most famous stones in France.

637
00:54:08,859 --> 00:54:11,191
You undoubtedly noticed it.

638
00:54:12,362 --> 00:54:17,095
Oh, now I see. I see what you mean.

639
00:54:17,534 --> 00:54:20,935
You think I had something
to do with the robbery.

640
00:54:21,004 --> 00:54:23,370
<i>- Now, madame...
- You suspect me!</i>

641
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,998
<i>Madame, don't excite yourself.</i>

642
00:54:25,075 --> 00:54:27,407
In a case like this,
we have to suspect everybody.

643
00:54:27,477 --> 00:54:29,172
That is until
they can prove their innocence.

644
00:54:29,246 --> 00:54:31,908
All right. I'll go along with you.

645
00:54:31,982 --> 00:54:34,883
I'll answer any questions you want me to.

646
00:54:34,952 --> 00:54:36,783
I'll get my coat.

647
00:54:36,853 --> 00:54:40,516
<i>- You'll have no trouble with me.
- Madame, compose yourself.</i>

648
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:43,287
You're taking too much for granted.
I'm not going to arrest you.

649
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:47,160
I haven't anything to arrest you for yet.
All I want is to ask you a few questions.

650
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:51,223
Oh, dear, an old woman like me

651
00:54:51,301 --> 00:54:53,633
mixed up in such a thing.

652
00:54:54,137 --> 00:54:57,504
What will the neighbors say? The gossip.

653
00:54:57,975 --> 00:55:00,603
I'll lose all my customers.

654
00:55:00,711 --> 00:55:05,648
Why, you might as well accuse one
of my little dolls as accuse me.

655
00:55:06,016 --> 00:55:08,883
Well, I hardly think we'd go as far as that.

656
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:13,783
Well, this is a beautiful thing.

657
00:55:15,759 --> 00:55:17,249
Surely you don't make them yourself?

658
00:55:17,327 --> 00:55:20,057
Oh, yes, yes,
everything in the shop we make...

659
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:23,930
Oh, please, don't touch the eyes.
They're not dry.

660
00:55:26,169 --> 00:55:28,729
It's something new
we've been working on.

661
00:55:28,805 --> 00:55:31,672
A doll with tears in its eyes.

662
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:41,048
It's an amusing idea for
the lady's boudoir. You see what I mean?

663
00:55:41,118 --> 00:55:42,176
No.

664
00:55:42,252 --> 00:55:46,552
Well, the tears remind
the husband or lover

665
00:55:46,623 --> 00:55:49,683
that when they're away
milady is Ionesome.

666
00:55:49,826 --> 00:55:51,487
Well, that's something new.

667
00:55:51,561 --> 00:55:56,191
You see, you men never know
what's going on behind your backs.

668
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,200
Well, you see, I...

669
00:56:02,139 --> 00:56:05,836
It's cute.
I haven't seen one of these in years.

670
00:56:12,516 --> 00:56:15,644
Oh, I see. The head.

671
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,417
<i>Oh, careful, monsieur.
You'll get paint on your fingers.</i>

672
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:24,221
- No, it's all right. It's dry.
- Oh, so it is.

673
00:56:25,495 --> 00:56:30,455
Malita, how many times have I told you
to fill these to the brim?

674
00:56:31,068 --> 00:56:32,933
We put candy in them.

675
00:56:33,003 --> 00:56:35,494
What are you trying to do,
cheat the children?

676
00:56:36,573 --> 00:56:39,337
<i>- Have you any children, monsieur?
- Yes.</i>

677
00:56:39,476 --> 00:56:42,536
Well, you must let me wrap
one of these up and take it home.

678
00:56:42,612 --> 00:56:43,977
It isn't necessary.

679
00:56:44,047 --> 00:56:47,483
- She'll be just as pleased as it is.
- She?

680
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:52,449
A little girl?
Oh, she'll like this much better.

681
00:56:52,856 --> 00:56:55,518
The clowns are for little boys.

682
00:56:56,059 --> 00:57:00,052
You know, I always thought
policemen were terrible men

683
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:02,758
that went around
with pistols in their pockets,

684
00:57:02,866 --> 00:57:06,131
always ready to drag a body off to prison.

685
00:57:07,237 --> 00:57:11,333
When you first started questioning me,
I was frightened to death.

686
00:57:11,742 --> 00:57:13,903
But you've been so kind to me,

687
00:57:13,977 --> 00:57:16,810
I'm sorry I haven't been able
to help you more.

688
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,006
Maybe you can at that.

689
00:57:18,081 --> 00:57:20,413
We may want you to come down
for the investigation.

690
00:57:20,484 --> 00:57:25,387
As long as my shop is here,
you'll always know where to find me.

691
00:57:25,655 --> 00:57:27,054
That's fine.

692
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:33,290
My dear Matin, you'll be going
to that hospital yourself tomorrow

693
00:57:33,363 --> 00:57:35,354
if you don't go home and get some sleep.

694
00:57:35,432 --> 00:57:40,165
Sleep. Do you think I can
close my eyes after seeing poor Emile?

695
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:43,268
Doctor, what could
have frightened him so?

696
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:46,434
- What could he have seen?
- He'll never be able to tell us.

697
00:57:46,977 --> 00:57:50,071
He'll be hopelessly paralyzed
for the rest of his life.

698
00:57:51,214 --> 00:57:54,411
A brilliant mind imprisoned
in a useless body.

699
00:57:54,785 --> 00:57:57,151
<i>- Imprisoned...
- Pardon, messieurs.</i>

700
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:00,621
- Mistletoe fresh from the market.
- No, no, go away.

701
00:58:04,828 --> 00:58:05,988
What's this?

702
00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:16,595
<i>- Where did this come from?
- I don't know, monsieur.</i>

703
00:58:16,673 --> 00:58:17,731
Don't lie.

704
00:58:17,808 --> 00:58:19,503
<i>But I assure you, monsieur,
I did not put it there.</i>

705
00:58:19,576 --> 00:58:21,043
What is it, Charles?

706
00:59:28,278 --> 00:59:31,679
Operator, get me the Prefect of Police.

707
00:59:56,373 --> 00:59:58,398
They've got enough of us
guarding this place.

708
00:59:58,475 --> 01:00:00,602
Yes, there's three up in the room
with him now.

709
01:00:01,578 --> 01:00:03,512
<i>You may retire if you wish, monsieur.</i>

710
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:06,481
- I assure you, you have nothing to fear.
- Retire?

711
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:08,847
- All the entrances are covered.
- Very well.

712
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:32,535
- What was that?
- See what that was.

713
01:00:35,345 --> 01:00:37,905
Butler, what was that noise down there?

714
01:00:37,981 --> 01:00:40,711
An ornament fell off the Christmas tree.

715
01:00:41,651 --> 01:00:43,380
You wouldn't think a little thing like that...

716
01:00:43,453 --> 01:00:44,852
- An ornament fell off.
- We heard him.

717
01:00:44,921 --> 01:00:47,583
- Sounded just like glass breaking.
- Yes, yes.

718
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:04,369
Relieve Pierre and have him
check up on the men outside.

719
01:01:04,441 --> 01:01:05,738
Very good.

720
01:01:07,677 --> 01:01:09,577
Red jack on the black queen.

721
01:01:09,646 --> 01:01:11,375
Do you have to whistle that way?

722
01:01:12,248 --> 01:01:13,909
- No, sir.
- Then stop it.

723
01:01:13,984 --> 01:01:16,714
<i>You mustn't let your nerves
get the better of you, Monsieur Matin.</i>

724
01:01:16,786 --> 01:01:19,516
They won't,
if I can have a little cooperation

725
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:21,614
from our musically inclined friend.

726
01:01:32,936 --> 01:01:34,130
Pierre.

727
01:01:35,205 --> 01:01:37,765
Don't forget the reception room
at the end of the hall.

728
01:01:37,841 --> 01:01:39,604
We have two men in there now.

729
01:01:39,676 --> 01:01:42,008
- Well, you better check up on them.
- Okay.

730
01:02:01,264 --> 01:02:03,562
<i>I wouldn't get too upset
about that note, Monsieur Matin.</i>

731
01:02:03,633 --> 01:02:06,431
Probably not for you at all.
Just some religious fanatic.

732
01:02:06,503 --> 01:02:10,337
- The city's full of them around Christmas.
- Thanks. That's very consoling.

733
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:13,937
That's why the Prefect sent
all you men to guard the house.

734
01:02:26,890 --> 01:02:30,417
- There's nothing to worry about.
- Perhaps not for you.

735
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:48,700
- There's something in this house.
- Oh, nothing could get by my men.

736
01:02:48,778 --> 01:02:49,904
No?

737
01:02:49,979 --> 01:02:53,608
If the other men around the house
are watching as hard as these two...

738
01:02:53,983 --> 01:02:56,383
<i>You better watch your nerves, monsieur.</i>

739
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:58,646
I don't think you realize
the importance of...

740
01:02:58,721 --> 01:03:02,088
- Do you have to open that door?
- I'll be right here.

741
01:03:04,527 --> 01:03:06,324
If only your men would...

742
01:03:07,564 --> 01:03:09,293
Oh, what's the use?

743
01:03:12,802 --> 01:03:14,326
Two minutes.

744
01:03:15,672 --> 01:03:19,267
<i>- I can't stand much more of this.
- Why don't you sit down, monsieur?</i>

745
01:03:26,816 --> 01:03:30,752
- Please, if you don't mind.
- Sorry.

746
01:03:55,712 --> 01:03:59,443
What shall I do? What should I do?

747
01:03:59,749 --> 01:04:01,148
There's nothing for you to do.

748
01:04:01,217 --> 01:04:04,345
- In a few seconds it'll all be over.
- Yes.

749
01:04:06,122 --> 01:04:09,888
A few seconds. A few seconds.

750
01:05:00,343 --> 01:05:05,144
Lavond, wherever you are,
in heaven's name, listen and have mercy.

751
01:05:06,149 --> 01:05:10,950
I'll confess. You're innocent.
We were the guilty ones.

752
01:05:14,724 --> 01:05:18,353
I've waited a long time
to read that, Malita.

753
01:05:19,495 --> 01:05:22,464
Paul Lavond is vindicated.

754
01:05:23,433 --> 01:05:28,370
Think of it. After 17 years
of shadows, I'm innocent.

755
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:31,104
Thanks to you, Malita.

756
01:05:31,374 --> 01:05:34,571
<i>And thanks to you, Madame Mandilip.</i>

757
01:05:34,644 --> 01:05:36,475
This is wonderful, Lavond.

758
01:05:36,546 --> 01:05:39,276
Now that you are free,
we can go on with our work

759
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:41,044
without being bothered by the police.

760
01:05:41,117 --> 01:05:45,884
No, Malita, my work is over,
but I am not free.

761
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:48,648
Why, if they ever found out who I was,

762
01:05:48,725 --> 01:05:51,785
the police would want
a lot of questions answered.

763
01:05:51,861 --> 01:05:55,524
What happened to Radin?
Who paralyzed Coulvet?

764
01:05:55,598 --> 01:05:59,125
No, Malita. When I proved my innocence,

765
01:05:59,202 --> 01:06:01,227
I condemned myself forever.

766
01:06:01,804 --> 01:06:03,601
We must get out of here.

767
01:06:04,607 --> 01:06:08,099
But before we go, we must destroy
everything in the back room.

768
01:06:08,177 --> 01:06:12,045
No, no! The ghost of Marcel
will curse you forever if you do.

769
01:06:12,115 --> 01:06:15,243
We've got to go on, Lavond.
We've got to carry out his plan.

770
01:06:15,318 --> 01:06:18,810
Now listen to me, Malita,
and try to understand.

771
01:06:19,222 --> 01:06:23,215
I never had any plans beyond
the vindication of my name,

772
01:06:23,293 --> 01:06:25,989
and I only wanted that
because of my family.

773
01:06:26,062 --> 01:06:29,498
Through Marcel's wild schemes,
I was able to do it.

774
01:06:29,565 --> 01:06:34,002
But we can't go on.
Why, our work is hideous.

775
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:37,369
We're cruel and it's got to come
to an end tonight.

776
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,773
No, Lavond. You can't do this.
I won't let you betray Marcel.

777
01:06:40,843 --> 01:06:42,970
If you go away,
I will carry out his work alone.

778
01:06:43,046 --> 01:06:45,037
Do you understand that? Alone.

779
01:06:45,381 --> 01:06:47,872
You fool. Do you want to go to prison?

780
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:51,477
<i>As Madame Mandilip,
I mailed a full confessiÃ³n to the police.</i>

781
01:06:51,554 --> 01:06:54,853
But we can't stop now!
There is so much left for us to do.

782
01:06:54,924 --> 01:06:59,418
There's nothing left for me to do, Malita.
The name of Lavond is cleared.

783
01:06:59,495 --> 01:07:03,192
My mother and daughter
will find nothing to be ashamed of.

784
01:07:04,567 --> 01:07:09,197
I'm sorry, Malita,
I didn't mean to speak harshly to you.

785
01:07:09,505 --> 01:07:13,441
I've plans for you.
You'll be well taken care of.

786
01:07:13,509 --> 01:07:16,376
But, please, do hurry.
Every minute counts.

787
01:07:16,879 --> 01:07:19,609
Put Lachna in the basket there with Radin.

788
01:07:19,949 --> 01:07:23,112
Their lives are ruined,
but we can't destroy them.

789
01:07:23,653 --> 01:07:26,451
We'll send them to the Prefect of Police.

790
01:07:33,996 --> 01:07:38,399
We've served his purpose, Radin.
Now he'll serve ours.

791
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,069
Reduced to your size,

792
01:07:41,237 --> 01:07:44,798
I'll control him as easily as I control you.

793
01:08:01,591 --> 01:08:04,958
Now, Radin, you are going to help me.

794
01:09:10,193 --> 01:09:12,423
Why, you poor insane wretch!

795
01:09:12,495 --> 01:09:15,089
I shall destroy you
with all the rest of this horror!

796
01:09:15,164 --> 01:09:16,256
Get out of here!

797
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:25,038
Malita, put that down!
You'll blow yourself to atoms!

798
01:09:25,107 --> 01:09:28,668
And you, too, Lavond.
You've had your vengeance.

799
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:31,778
- Now Marcel will have his.
- Malita!

800
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:39,510
Death doesn't frighten me.
Why, it's been part of my plan.

801
01:09:40,523 --> 01:09:45,483
But not yet, Malita.
I still have something to do for my child.

802
01:09:45,795 --> 01:09:48,787
When that's done, I'll die gladly.

803
01:09:49,832 --> 01:09:54,201
Now, Malita, you don't want to do that.

804
01:09:55,238 --> 01:09:57,604
You don't want to die, Malita.

805
01:09:59,041 --> 01:10:03,171
Think of your work, think of Marcel.

806
01:10:03,613 --> 01:10:04,807
Give it to me!

807
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:10,482
Malita!

808
01:10:12,088 --> 01:10:13,487
Malita!

809
01:10:26,402 --> 01:10:28,370
- Where's Frank?
- Downstairs.

810
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:31,531
Frank! What did you find?

811
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:32,835
Not a sign of anything.

812
01:10:32,909 --> 01:10:36,037
Guess she planned to blow this place up
before she mailed her confessiÃ³n.

813
01:10:36,112 --> 01:10:38,205
<i>Well, that's the end of Madame Mandilip.</i>

814
01:10:38,281 --> 01:10:40,875
We're pretty smart, eh?
Got everything pinned on Lavond,

815
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:43,851
only to find out it's the work
of a crazy old woman.

816
01:10:45,955 --> 01:10:47,616
Taxi? Taxi?

817
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:52,594
<i>- Taxi.
- Yes, monsieur. Sorry, monsieur.</i>

818
01:10:52,662 --> 01:10:54,027
<i>Step right in, monsieur.</i>

819
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:58,491
Aren't you afraid of losing customers
by such devotion to the newspapers?

820
01:10:58,568 --> 01:11:02,163
<i>I'm sorry, monsieur. I'm usually on the job,
but I just happened to be interested</i>

821
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:04,035
in this story of Paul Lavond.

822
01:11:04,106 --> 01:11:06,802
<i>- Would you care to read it, monsieur?
- No, thanks, I've read it.</i>

823
01:11:11,547 --> 01:11:14,846
<i>- Where to, monsieur?
- Drive anywhere you want to.</i>

824
01:11:15,818 --> 01:11:18,446
<i>That's a very dangerous order
to give a taxi driver, monsieur.</i>

825
01:11:18,521 --> 01:11:22,787
Yes. But you're not
an ordinary taxi driver, are you?

826
01:11:23,225 --> 01:11:24,317
Toto?

827
01:11:24,393 --> 01:11:28,090
<i>That's all I am now, monsieur.
But one day soon I hope...</i>

828
01:11:29,298 --> 01:11:33,234
- How'd you know my name was Toto?
- Because I...

829
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:37,634
My name is Paul Lavond.

830
01:11:39,075 --> 01:11:43,205
Now, now, careful, Toto.
Don't let me startle you.

831
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,977
Drive somewhere we can be alone.

832
01:11:46,315 --> 01:11:49,443
- I promised to meet Lorraine at sundown.
- How is she?

833
01:11:49,518 --> 01:11:51,349
Have you seen her since the papers?

834
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:54,116
<i>No, monsieur, I didn't like to talk
to her about it at the laundry</i>

835
01:11:54,190 --> 01:11:56,784
- in front of all the others.
- Yes, I know, Toto.

836
01:11:56,859 --> 01:11:59,350
<i>You don't know what your freedom
means to me, Monsieur Lavond.</i>

837
01:11:59,428 --> 01:12:00,918
Yes, I do, Toto.

838
01:12:00,997 --> 01:12:04,262
That's why I've got to talk to you,
but alone.

839
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,994
<i>When I want to be alone, monsieur,
I always go to the tower.</i>

840
01:12:08,104 --> 01:12:10,072
It's so far above everything
and everybody.

841
01:12:10,139 --> 01:12:13,165
<i>- The Eiffel Tower, Toto?
- Yes, monsieur.</i>

842
01:12:15,077 --> 01:12:20,014
Now that I have my freedom,
my exile must commence all over again.

843
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:23,484
- You can see that, can't you?
- I'm trying to.

844
01:12:24,754 --> 01:12:28,349
Well, at least you can understand
why I can't rejoin my family.

845
01:12:28,424 --> 01:12:30,358
Yes, yes, I can see that.

846
01:12:31,127 --> 01:12:35,496
But it all seems so unjust and unfair.
All you've done, you've done for them.

847
01:12:36,932 --> 01:12:38,763
<i>I'm so sorry, Monsieur Lavond.</i>

848
01:12:38,834 --> 01:12:42,668
Oh, I wouldn't be.
I'm rather happy about it.

849
01:12:43,072 --> 01:12:47,406
You can marry Lorraine.
My fortune will be restored to her.

850
01:12:47,476 --> 01:12:51,242
And you can live
contentedly together ever after.

851
01:12:52,214 --> 01:12:56,548
- That's a proper ending to a story, isn't it?
- Lorraine. I forgot.

852
01:12:56,619 --> 01:12:57,847
What?

853
01:12:58,154 --> 01:13:00,918
This is where she's going
to meet me at sundown.

854
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:02,924
<i>I didn't mean to trick you, monsieur.</i>

855
01:13:02,992 --> 01:13:05,859
I merely thought it would please her.
I still do.

856
01:13:05,928 --> 01:13:07,793
Whatever may happen afterwards.

857
01:13:07,963 --> 01:13:10,989
Oh, Toto, it can't be.

858
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,832
Why, even when I was innocent,
her hatred of me hurt a good deal.

859
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:20,538
And now that I'm guilty,
her belief in me would hurt even more.

860
01:13:21,544 --> 01:13:25,344
And if the police should ever... Oh, no, no.

861
01:13:25,881 --> 01:13:28,645
- I'm going.
- But where?

862
01:13:28,718 --> 01:13:31,881
At least you can tell me that.
I could send you your money and...

863
01:13:31,954 --> 01:13:34,752
Where I'm going, Toto,
I won't need any money.

864
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:40,418
Goodbye, and remember I expect you
to take good care of my little girl.

865
01:13:42,431 --> 01:13:44,160
Watch your hats.

866
01:13:44,767 --> 01:13:47,895
- Toto, have you seen the papers?
- Yes, dear.

867
01:13:50,206 --> 01:13:52,606
- Then you've read about Father?
- Yes.

868
01:13:53,943 --> 01:13:57,276
- Aren't you ashamed of me?
- Of course not.

869
01:13:57,346 --> 01:14:01,282
Well, I am, terribly.
I'll never forgive myself never. I...

870
01:14:05,321 --> 01:14:06,618
I'm sorry?

871
01:14:07,957 --> 01:14:11,688
- Are you Lorraine Lavond?
- Yes.

872
01:14:11,761 --> 01:14:15,458
The daughter of Paul Lavond?

873
01:14:15,564 --> 01:14:20,263
- Yes. He's my father.
- May I speak freely?

874
01:14:20,336 --> 01:14:22,770
<i>- Yes, of course, monsieur.
- Where are you going, Toto?</i>

875
01:14:22,838 --> 01:14:24,533
I'll be right here, dear.

876
01:14:24,607 --> 01:14:26,939
<i>Won't you sit down, mademoiselle?</i>

877
01:14:30,045 --> 01:14:32,980
I was waiting for you
because our friend here

878
01:14:33,048 --> 01:14:35,846
was good enough to tell me
he was going to meet you.

879
01:14:35,918 --> 01:14:38,546
- Why?
- Well, in searching for you today,

880
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:42,022
I was fortunate enough
to be directed to him.

881
01:14:42,558 --> 01:14:44,549
<i>You see, mademoiselle...</i>

882
01:14:46,929 --> 01:14:50,421
- I'm a friend of your father's.
- Is he in Paris?

883
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,566
- I served many years with him in prison.
- Where's he now?

884
01:14:54,637 --> 01:14:58,004
- As a matter of fact, we escaped together.
- Oh, please tell me where he is.

885
01:14:58,073 --> 01:15:00,371
I'll search for him, anywhere.

886
01:15:01,143 --> 01:15:04,704
You see, I've hated my father all my life,

887
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:07,715
and now I've got to find him
and beg his forgiveness.

888
01:15:08,184 --> 01:15:09,947
And ask him to come home with me.

889
01:15:10,486 --> 01:15:13,922
I don't think he ever
really thought you hated him.

890
01:15:14,323 --> 01:15:16,723
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

891
01:15:17,092 --> 01:15:19,617
But he can never come home to you.

892
01:15:20,596 --> 01:15:24,191
My dear child, your father is dead.

893
01:15:30,973 --> 01:15:35,706
Yes. He passed away in a swamp
during our escape from prison.

894
01:15:36,278 --> 01:15:39,577
The last thing he did was
to write a letter to his mother,

895
01:15:39,648 --> 01:15:41,377
which I have given to Toto.

896
01:15:42,051 --> 01:15:44,713
He sent me with a message to you.

897
01:15:45,054 --> 01:15:48,080
He told me if I ever saw you,

898
01:15:49,191 --> 01:15:54,128
to take your hand and tell you
that he loved you very dearly,

899
01:15:55,064 --> 01:15:59,763
and that all those years in prison
he'd watched you grow,

900
01:16:00,803 --> 01:16:05,467
talked to you,
laughed with you, dined with you,

901
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:08,677
and that he sent you a kiss.

902
01:16:21,257 --> 01:16:24,886
Then, he said,

903
01:16:26,128 --> 01:16:28,653
this was the most important thing of all.

904
01:16:29,431 --> 01:16:32,889
He told me to tell you to forget him.

905
01:16:34,737 --> 01:16:38,036
To find happiness and keep it.

906
01:16:38,908 --> 01:16:42,002
To marry and to give your children

907
01:16:42,077 --> 01:16:45,342
all the love you might have given him

908
01:16:45,414 --> 01:16:47,882
if he hadn't been taken away from you.

909
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:53,982
It's very kind of you
to bring me this message.

910
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:55,955
Yes.

911
01:16:56,558 --> 01:17:00,289
Little bit foolish, too.
The police are still after me.

912
01:17:00,362 --> 01:17:01,989
Well, goodbye.

913
01:17:02,064 --> 01:17:04,259
- Goodbye and good luck.
- Thank you.

914
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:08,529
Well, I better be going.
The sun's almost down.

915
01:17:08,604 --> 01:17:10,231
It'll be up again tomorrow.

916
01:17:10,306 --> 01:17:13,173
Will it? I wonder.

917
01:17:14,643 --> 01:17:16,167
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

918
01:17:23,419 --> 01:17:24,852
Toto,

919
01:17:25,988 --> 01:17:29,617
I have the strangest feeling
I've seen him somewhere before.

920
01:17:31,126 --> 01:17:33,060
- You have.
- Where?

921
01:17:34,029 --> 01:17:35,929
He was in the laundry looking for you.

922
01:17:35,998 --> 01:17:38,865
There were so many people around,
he got afraid.

923
01:17:39,101 --> 01:17:41,069
On account of the police, I mean.

924
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:44,735
- That's how he came to find me.
- Perhaps that's it.

925
01:17:45,507 --> 01:17:47,134
I don't remember.

926
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:50,310
Remember me?

927
01:17:52,982 --> 01:17:54,677
Oh, Toto.

928
01:17:56,852 --> 01:18:00,117
<i>- It's a nice evening, monsieur.
- Yes.</i>

929
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:03,925
Probably the nicest evening of my life.

930
01:18:12,801 --> 01:18:13,790
English
