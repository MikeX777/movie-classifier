1
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,500
Rami!

2
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,130
Someone's knocking!

3
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,040
One moment!

4
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,500
One moment!

5
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,000
One second, hold on one second.

6
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,750
Why do you let him walk around alone?

7
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,670
He shit at the entrance to the building.

8
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,500
Right at the entrance. A huge pile!

9
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,790
What do you mean?
My husband took him for a walk.

10
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,040
Your husband wasn't with him.

11
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,380
The dog was alone
at the entrance to the building.

12
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,460
What do you mean alone?

13
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,210
Alone, meaning alone.

14
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,420
The door was locked, so I let him in.

15
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,830
Thank God it was locked.

16
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,420
Otherwise he'd shit in the lobby.

17
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,750
Are you sure?

18
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,000
Sure of what?

19
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,630
That my husband wasn't around?

20
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,460
Yes, I'm sure.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,630
Clean it up, please. Now!

22
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,460
Of course, I'll clean it now.

23
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,500
Tell your husband this won't happen again.

24
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,460
Yes.

25
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,290
It's Friday night.

26
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,170
People are coming home from the synagogue
and see this pile of shit at the entrance.

27
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,130
That's not right.

28
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,420
You're right.

29
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,420
I'll tell him. I'll clean it up now.
I apologize.

30
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,040
Shabbat shalom.

31
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,500
Shabbat shalom.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What is it?

33
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,830
Bruno?

34
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,830
Where's Dad?

35
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,250
-What's up?
-Hi, Dudi.

36
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,790
Hi, it's Shir.

37
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,250
-Shir, hey.
-Say, do you know where's Rami?

38
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,210
No.

39
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,880
I saw that you spoke with him
in the morning.

40
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,580
Yes.

41
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,250
Did he say something about today?
If he had any plans for the evening?

42
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,420
No, I don't think so.

43
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,790
No? So what did he say?

44
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,830
Nothing special. We just talked.

45
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,580
What do you mean, "just talked"?
He must've called to say something.

46
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,040
Well, you know, work stuff.
Why, what happened?

47
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,790
I don't know. I don't know where he is.

48
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,710
-What do you mean?
-I was asleep and he...

49
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,040
He probably went for a walk with Bruno,
but Bruno suddenly came back

50
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,000
and Rami didn't. I don't know where he is.
All of his stuff is here.

51
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,000
His cellphone... I don't know.
He disappeared.

52
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,500
-Dudi?
-I don't know where he is.

53
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,080
I don't know.
Maybe we should call the police.

54
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,330
How did he sound to you when you talked?

55
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,540
How did he sound?

56
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,670
Yes, when you talked,
how did he sound to you?

57
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,040
Sad? Happy?

58
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,710
Okay? Not okay? How?

59
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,330
He sounded as always, I don't know.

60
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,710
Why don't you ever know anything?
You're his best friend!

61
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,830
-Don't you know anything?
-What do you want from me?

62
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,880
I don't know where he is.
If I knew, I'd tell you.

63
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,460
We talked, he sounded fine, that's it.
How did he sound to you?

64
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,330
-I don't know?
-Did you speak today?

65
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,080
Shir?

66
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,080
We didn't really speak.

67
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:21,380
He was really busy, he was in his room
all the time, working and stuff.

68
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,170
For how long did he go out?

69
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,960
I don't know, I was asleep.

70
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,290
How long were you asleep?

71
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,170
Two, three hours, something like that.

72
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,790
Did you check outside?

73
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,500
No, I just woke up.

74
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,130
Did you talk to people?

75
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,750
-What people?
-I don't know.

76
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,630
Fuck, I'm stuck up north now.

77
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,630
What about Shuster?

78
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,790
Okay, I'll call him.

79
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,960
I'll call him now. Stay available.

80
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,630
Okay? Shir?

81
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,710
Hello?

82
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,210
Hello?

83
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,000
Shir?

84
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,670
Rami?

85
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,710
Rami?

86
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,460
Rami?

87
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,000
Rami?

88
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,500
-Hey!
-Hi.

89
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,420
Hi!

90
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,880
Hi, are we early?

91
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,250
No, no, you're not early.

92
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,670
-Come in.
-This is Nadav.

93
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,580
-Hi, I'm Shir.
-Hi.

94
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,250
-Hello?
-Hello? Yes, I'm listening.

95
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,750
You forgot we scheduled for today.

96
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,710
-There was no one here...
-One second. Come in, sit.

97
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,630
Hello?

98
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,710
There was no one here
matching your description.

99
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,750
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

100
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,290
Can you please check again?

101
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,040
Ma'am, I just checked.

102
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,670
How can you be 100% sure?

103
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,540
Ma'am, there was no one here
in the last couple of hours.

104
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,420
-Okay, I understand.
-Shabbat shalom.

105
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,460
What? Everything okay?

106
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,500
Sit. Why are you standing? Sit.

107
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,710
Sit down. One moment, I...

108
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,790
I'll be right there, alright?
I'll fix myself up.

109
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,170
I'll open the wine.

110
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,710
You know where the glasses are, right?

111
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,210
Okay.

112
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,750
Sweetie?

113
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,500
Look, just like ours.

114
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,540
I had so much fun at the inn.

115
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,170
Shall we go?

116
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,540
Of course.

117
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,790
-Here's to yesterday.
-Here's to us.

118
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,670
Good, right?

119
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,670
Hi.

120
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,830
Hey.

121
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,580
Where's Rami?

122
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,790
Rami disappeared.

123
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,670
Disappeared?

124
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,080
Yes. I'm so sorry that I didn't...

125
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,290
that I didn't call. I should've called
and canceled. I just...

126
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,330
I forgot you were coming.

127
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,880
Disappeared.

128
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,880
I...

129
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,920
I don't know where he disappeared to,
because he just...

130
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,500
didn't come home.

131
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,500
He went for a walk with Bruno,
but I was asleep.

132
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,540
Then Bruno came back
with one of the neighbors

133
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,630
because he was at the entrance
to the building.

134
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,670
Rami didn't come back.
I have no idea where he might be.

135
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,790
All his stuff is here. Cellphone, wallet.
I don't know how to reach him.

136
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,170
Did you have a fight?

137
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,420
No, no, on the contrary.

138
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,380
It's been really good lately.

139
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,710
He was really busy with this project,
busy recording and editing all the time.

140
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,670
I have no idea.
I think something happened to him.

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,380
There's nothing that can...

142
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,920
He always calls me.

143
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,920
Maybe he went somewhere.

144
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,210
It's Friday night, it's raining!
Everything's closed. Where could he go?

145
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,130
It's so not like him
to just leave Bruno on the street,

146
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,460
not tell me anything and disappear?

147
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,630
What is that?

148
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,420
I called hospitals.

149
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,540
There was no one matching his description.

150
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,580
I don't know.

151
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,830
Did you call the police?

152
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,130
Yes, I called the police!

153
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,960
They said they can't help
because only after 24 hours

154
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,540
is a person considered missing,
unless there's immediate danger.

155
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,500
What is immediate danger?

156
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,750
What does it mean, "immediate danger"?

157
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,460
I don't know what else I can do.

158
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,000
I called his friends.

159
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,920
I called his dad.

160
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,080
-What can happen...
-Did you explain to the police?

161
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes, but they said they get 50 complaints
like this every day

162
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,670
and it turns out to be nothing.

163
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,830
And it's Friday night,
so no one will do anything

164
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,790
unless they're sure
something happened to him.

165
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
What assholes!

166
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,580
Maybe it's really nothing?

167
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,580
You know,

168
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,830
sometimes things happen and there
seems to be no logical explanation,

169
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,290
no positive explanation.

170
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,670
But then you find out what really happened

171
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,580
and you realize that you just
didn't think about it.

172
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,920
I mean... whatever it is,
you just didn't think about it.

173
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,960
And everything's fine in the end.

174
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,460
Nadavi, I want to have a moment
alone with Shir.

175
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,670
Okay.

176
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,040
No, stay.

177
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,380
We'll go to the room.
Come here for a second.

178
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,170
One moment, sweetie.

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,630
So, what did you fight about?

180
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,040
We didn't fight.

181
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,210
I thought you didn't want to say
because of Nadav.

182
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,880
No. I told you, we didn't fight.

183
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,040
On the contrary, everything was fine.

184
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,290
He was busy all the time.
Nothing happened lately.

185
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,080
I have no idea what it can be.

186
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,250
Maybe he's upset with something
that didn't happen lately?

187
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,330
No.

188
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,460
Why do you think it's relevant?

189
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,000
Because he's like that.

190
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,210
-What do you mean, "like that"?
-You know...

191
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,750
Holds grudges, vengeful...

192
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,210
This is his revenge?

193
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,750
That he leaves and doesn't come back?

194
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,460
He's fucked up.

195
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,790
He can do that just to make you suffer.

196
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,790
No way.

197
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,500
-Yes way.
-No!

198
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,000
You don't even know him.

199
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,540
I know him pretty well.

200
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,750
Not as well as I do.

201
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,130
Besides, he changed since then.
You said so yourself.

202
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,790
Yes, he changed a bit,
but some things don't change.

203
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,750
-Adi.
-Shir, he's fucked up, I told you.

204
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,330
-Don't say I didn't tell you.
-This has nothing to do with you.

205
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,040
What's this got to do with anything now?

206
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,380
Something happened to him.
Do you understand that

207
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,580
something happened to him,
and you're telling me this?

208
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,710
Go fuck yourself, Adi!
Just go fuck yourself.

209
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,250
You're such a bitch sometimes.
I'm shocked that you said that.

210
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,790
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said it.

211
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,960
-No, you really shouldn't have.
-You're right. Sorry.

212
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,710
Sorry, it's not relevant, sorry.

213
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,250
Really not relevant!

214
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,880
Sorry, I was being a bitch.

215
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,460
Sorry. Come on, I'm sorry.

216
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,080
Sorry, sorry!

217
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,790
-I'm sorry.
-Okay.

218
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,500
Cute. Nadav.

219
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,920
Gorgeous.

220
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,210
It's funny what he said.

221
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,130
-Funny?
-Yes.

222
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,540
I mean, not what he said, but...

223
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,330
Rami would've probably reacted
exactly the same, you know.

224
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,380
What did he say?

225
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,330
He didn't say anything.
Just said that it'll be okay.

226
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,670
You know...

227
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,130
tried to...

228
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,000
So what do we do now?

229
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,580
-I have no idea.
-Forget about it. Let's go.

230
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,710
Let's drink some wine.

231
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,250
Come on.

232
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,000
We'll figure out what to do
in the living room.

233
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,130
-Okay.
-Let's go.

234
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,460
Say, he knows about you and Rami?

235
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,670
Why would he know about Rami and me?

236
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:07,040
-I don't know, I thought...
-If it gets serious, I'll tell him.

237
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,330
-Okay.
-Go to the living room, I have to pee.

238
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,000
Adi told me that

239
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,710
you own a restaurant or something.

240
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,500
Yes, me and another partner.

241
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,710
-Nice.
-Yeah.

242
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,790
Someone else is planning
to open another branch.

243
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,460
-Really?
-Abed's closing in Rishon Letzion.

244
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,460
-Cool. In Tel Aviv?
-No.

245
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,040
-Really?
-Yes.

246
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,290
Do you know that

247
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,420
that they went out, Adi and Rami?

248
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,880
That's how I met him.

249
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,330
After a while he

250
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,290
dumped her.

251
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,880
Maybe she dumped him, I don't know.

252
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,250
A year later we met somewhere
and he hit on me. Really...

253
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,290
sweet.

254
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,790
I liked him when they were still together.

255
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,580
I asked her if it's okay, if I go out
with him and she said...

256
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,380
She thinks he's fucked up, but it's okay.
She's not mad or anything.

257
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,670
I know.

258
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,080
-What?
-She told me.

259
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,040
So, what are we going to do?

260
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,710
-I think you better go.
-Are you serious?

261
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,710
No way! We're staying, right?

262
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,670
Yes, yes. You shouldn't be alone now.

263
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,460
No, no. Go. I...

264
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You being here doesn't help me.
I'm sorry I'm like this, but...

265
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,750
I need to be alone, figure out what to do.
You being here doesn't help me.

266
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,170
Maybe I should go and Adi should stay?

267
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,920
No, no. Both of you leave.

268
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,040
Please.

269
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,920
-Shir Ripin?
-Yes, come in, please.

270
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,080
Your husband's home?

271
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,000
No.

272
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,420
-Do you know where he is?
-No.

273
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,000
Okay. Tell us what happened.

274
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,460
Do you want something to drink?

275
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,330
-Water.
-Okay.

276
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,250
What happened is my husband's missing.

277
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,330
I...

278
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:30,420
I called the police and they said a person
is considered missing only after 24 hours,

279
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,250
unless there's immediate danger.

280
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,710
I know something happened to him.
They said you get many calls like this.

281
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,880
-Excuse me.
-So, I didn't...

282
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,040
You called the police to complain
that your husband hit you.

283
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,420
Yes. I needed to get you here.

284
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,040
When I said he's missing,
no one took me seriously.

285
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,710
So, did your husband hit you, or not?

286
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,080
No, he didn't hit me.

287
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,330
-I don't understand. Do you understand?
-No.

288
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,460
What happened is...

289
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,750
I was asleep.

290
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,040
He took the dog for a walk.
The dog came back, my husband didn't.

291
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,170
I don't know where he is.

292
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,830
All his stuff is here.
His cellphone, his wallet, his moped.

293
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,040
Everything's here. He disappeared.

294
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,460
Something must have happened
when he was walking the dog.

295
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,580
Do you understand?

296
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,080
So why did you call and said he hit you?

297
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,830
Well... I wanted you to come here.

298
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,790
-When I said missing, no one took me...
-This won't help you.

299
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,210
You think we'll go out to the street
to look for him, since we're here?

300
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,580
I thought you might do something.

301
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,880
It was useless calling on the phone.

302
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,130
The secretary...
The police woman I spoke to on the phone.

303
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,540
She didn't listen to me.
She didn't believe it was serious.

304
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,710
So, you decided to lie a bit?
To press false charges?

305
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,790
-It's not false charges.
-Yes, it is.

306
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:03,830
Complaining about something that didn't
happen is the definition of false charges.

307
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,380
You called the police
and said your husband hit you.

308
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,960
For no reason. Just because
that's what you felt like saying.

309
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,790
Do you understand that the things
you say have consequences?

310
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,920
Significance? Do you understand
the meaning of a false complaint?

311
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,790
Do you understand how much harm
it can cause to a person's life? Career?

312
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,130
Do you understand or don't you?

313
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,670
While your husband is supposedly missing,
you're sitting here drinking wine.

314
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:35,920
The wine is... My friends poured it

315
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,210
before I even told them. Forget the wine.

316
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,290
42. Copy.

317
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,250
This is 42.

318
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,920
-So, you told them and they left?
-We're a bit delayed.

319
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,170
Everything alright?

320
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,580
-I'll get back to you soon.
-Because I asked them to leave.

321
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,420
I felt uncomfortable with them being here.

322
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,080
I understand. Why did you say he hit you?

323
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,460
I told you already.

324
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,960
I'm asking why you chose
to say that of all things.

325
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,170
You could've made up a different lie.

326
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,830
I thought it would get you here faster.

327
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,960
If you'd said a rapist is trying to break
in, we'd get here even faster, right?

328
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,290
I guess so.

329
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,250
-But you didn't think of that?
-No, I didn't think of that.

330
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,580
What you thought to say
is that your husband hit you.

331
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,130
-Yes.
-So why?

332
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,040
I don't know why. No reason. I don't know.

333
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,880
Maybe because the reason I needed you is

334
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,580
my husband, so I made up something about
my husband. I don't know.

335
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,130
-What difference does it make?
-He didn't hit you?

336
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,580
No, no, he didn't hit me.
I don't understand what you want.

337
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,210
He never hit you?

338
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,540
No, no! He never hit me!

339
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,880
Are you sure?

340
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,960
I don't understand what you want from me.

341
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,710
Your husband has a history of violence
towards women.

342
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,790
I don't understand.

343
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,040
He hit a woman once
and she filed a complaint.

344
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,000
-Rami?
-Yes.

345
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,580
When?

346
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,460
A few years ago.

347
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,330
I think you're wrong. It...

348
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,670
It sounds to me like you have the
wrong name or something. It's not...

349
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,750
Adi Khalfi.

350
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,130
Do you know her?

351
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,380
Do you?

352
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,290
Yes, she's his ex. I know her.

353
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,500
She filed a complaint against him.

354
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,500
He got mad with her once.
Punched her in the face.

355
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,170
He didn't tell you that?

356
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,170
Now you also complain he hit you.

357
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,290
So, we get here and it turns out
he's not here.

358
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,920
And you're claiming he didn't hit you
and that he's actually missing.

359
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,790
You had friends here,
you sat here drinking wine

360
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,330
while your husband's missing
at night, in the rain.

361
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,080
This doesn't seem odd to you?
Do you find it odd?

362
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,380
I've heard stranger things.

363
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,540
Alright. When did he leave?

364
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,330
I don't know exactly.
I was asleep at the time, but...

365
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,380
I went to sleep at around 04:00-04:30 pm.

366
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,460
What was he wearing?

367
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,540
One moment, I'll check.

368
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,170
Maybe I'll know from the jacket.

369
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,710
Probably a leather jacket.
A black leather jacket.

370
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,000
How old is he?

371
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,790
35.

372
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,080
Height? Weight?

373
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,040
He's 5'8".

374
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:58,000
I don't know. Maybe 155 pounds.
Maybe a bit less.

375
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,790
Let me check something.

376
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,540
Thank you.

377
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,580
43. This is 42.

378
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,080
43.

379
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,000
Yes, copy 42.

380
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,880
-Do you want to drink something?
-No, thank you.

381
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,210
I'll make myself a drink.

382
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,210
Why did you say he hit you?

383
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,830
-I already told you why.
-I don't believe you.

384
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,500
People don't just say things like that.

385
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,000
Other things, maybe. Things like this, no.

386
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,130
People say all kinds of things.

387
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,130
All kinds of things,
but not things like this.

388
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,540
I... I don't understand

389
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,540
-why it matters to you so much.
-I ask the questions, you answer.

390
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,500
This is how it works.

391
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,170
Okay.

392
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,420
-Who decided?
-I decided. I'm the police officer, right?

393
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,380
I don't understand what's with you.

394
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,710
What's with you?

395
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,630
You call to say someone hit you
when in fact no one hit you.

396
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,000
What's your problem? Do you want
someone to hit you, is that it?

397
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:38,250
I don't understand what
you're talking about.

398
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,540
What?

399
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,040
Are you afraid of me?

400
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,130
Are you afraid I'll hit you?

401
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:14,170
You're... You're sick.

402
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,960
He hit me once.
That's what you wanted to hear?

403
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,210
He hit me once.

404
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,630
He didn't really hit me.
It was a small punch.

405
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,920
Bullshit.

406
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,330
We had a fight, he tried to leave.
I stood in his way, so he tried to move me

407
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,420
and he sort of punched me,
pushed me into the wall.

408
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,420
Do you fight a lot?

409
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,750
Like everyone else.

410
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,210
What do you mean, "like everyone else"?

411
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,880
Sometimes.

412
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,000
Maybe he's not missing?

413
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,630
Maybe he ran away?

414
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,580
Maybe he was miserable here?

415
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,000
Was there someone else?
Was he having an affair?

416
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,460
You thought he was fucking
someone else on the side?

417
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,420
Ma'am, I'm just doing my job.

418
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:24,250
Your husband is missing and I need to ask
the questions that must be asked.

419
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,920
-I don't understand what's your problem.
-I don't have a problem.

420
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,710
You have a problem.

421
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,210
That's why you called the police, right?
Now let the police do its job.

422
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:37,080
Do you think there's a possibility
he simply ran away?

423
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,880
Left everything and disappeared
of his own will?

424
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,790
No.

425
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,210
Okay.

426
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,170
There wasn't anything out of the ordinary
in the area in the last few hours.

427
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,960
No one matching his description
was brought to the hospital.

428
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,420
If he doesn't show up before morning,
we'll open a case and begin searching.

429
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,540
Hi.

430
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,460
Hi, Doron.

431
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,960
I thought that I should stop by.

432
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,750
Pass through.

433
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,670
-Come in, come in.
-Thank you.

434
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,830
What a surprise.

435
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
Have a sit.

436
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,380
-Something to drink?
-Nothing, thank you.

437
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,880
Are you sure you don't want
anything to drink?

438
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,960
-Thank you. Really, nothing.
-Okay.

439
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,670
Yes.

440
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,170
-Okay?
-Yes, yes, sure.

441
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,580
Maybe a beer?

442
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,500
I don't think we have beer,
but we have wine.

443
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,380
Red wine gives me headaches.

444
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:10,210
-There's also whiskey or something.
-No, no.

445
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,040
I thought a beer would go well
with the cigarette.

446
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,500
-I'm driving and they're strict nowadays.
-Yes.

447
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,670
How are you?

448
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,920
Say, did you speak recently or something?

449
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,540
No, we're not in touch. Not at all.

450
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,830
Birthdays, we call to say congratulations.
Sometimes on holidays, but that's it.

451
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,750
Yes.

452
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,830
When did you last meet?

453
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,420
A few years ago. He came to my show.

454
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,750
You were there too.

455
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,080
Yes, I was. It was a great show.

456
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,210
-Thanks. Thanks.
-Yes...

457
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,830
Those were good times.

458
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,630
How are things now?

459
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,540
We see you sometimes on TV

460
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,080
and on the radio.

461
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,790
Thank you. It's not what it used to be.

462
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,580
But I'm getting by. It's okay.

463
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:13,630
-How... You... You do...
-Shiatsu.

464
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,790
-Shiatsu.
-Yes.

465
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,710
It's going really well.

466
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,460
I started working at this
great clinic in Herzliya.

467
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,540
-Great.
-Yes.

468
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,250
-Good, great.
-It's really good there.

469
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,290
-Very good.
-Yes.

470
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,540
He did stuff like this when he was a kid?

471
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,000
What stuff?

472
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,580
Go somewhere and disappear.

473
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,880
No. No, not that I remember. He...

474
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,380
He spent more time with his mom.
I was busy recording, performing.

475
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,130
When we separated

476
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,540
he was really little, 4 or 5 years old.

477
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,460
Yes.

478
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,420
-I apologize, I'm sorry.
-Hold on, I'll get...

479
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,670
No, it's okay, I'll just get an ashtray.

480
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,330
Really, he was a good kid. He was quiet
and serious. I remember

481
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,830
that one time he even,

482
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,920
I think it was a birthday,

483
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:22,710
I gave him a guitar as a present
and he was so serious, played so well.

484
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,210
So small that the guitar was bigger
than him. He could barely hold it.

485
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,670
You think he...

486
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,170
that something happened to him?

487
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,830
I really hope not, but you know...

488
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,540
I have no explanation.

489
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,250
I don't even have a lead. I don't know.

490
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,380
It's really weird, you know.

491
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,080
You've been doing okay lately?

492
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,460
Totally. Yes.

493
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,630
And he wasn't stressed about work
or money or anything?

494
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,130
No, everything was normal. I don't know.

495
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,670
Listen, Shir, I have to go.
I'm expected somewhere.

496
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,670
Okay.

497
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,580
Thanks for coming.

498
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,460
It's really nice.

499
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,880
-It'll be okay. Everything will work out.
-Yes. Thank you.

500
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,330
Shir, I thought I should
tell you something.

501
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,830
Did you read something that...

502
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,750
I don't know how to tell you...

503
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,790
Look, he came to me

504
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:04,880
one day a few weeks ago. He showed up at
my house and asked for money, a loan.

505
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,000
And said he'll pay it back
in a few months.

506
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,580
How much money?

507
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,580
20,000 shekels.

508
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,130
But the most important part is
he made me swear

509
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:21,960
that if I happen to run into you,
I won't tell you anything about it.

510
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,710
Did he says why he needed the money?

511
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,460
He said that things are tight,
that he's not making enough money

512
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,290
and you don't have enough work

513
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:33,330
-and he didn't want to go to the bank.
-It's so weird. He has a ton of work.

514
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,580
I've been making really good money lately.

515
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,670
I don't know. That's what he said.

516
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,420
Did you give him the money?

517
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,500
He's my only son, Shir.

518
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,750
He said he'll pay it back in a few months.

519
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:52,420
Why does he need the money?
What can you do with 20,000 shekels?

520
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:58,790
I guess a lot of things. What can you do
with 20,000 shekels? Things.

521
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,460
-What?
-Look, he came to me.

522
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,500
He just showed up, asked for money.
I assumed you were tight for money.

523
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,920
I gave him the money,
I didn't ask too many questions.

524
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,960
Plus, he said he'll pay me back
in a few months.

525
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,080
-Wait, I'll write you a check.
-No, no, no.

526
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:18,420
-No, I don't...
-I don't know. We don't need the money.

527
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,040
-I have no idea why he asked...
-I'm asking you, don't. No.

528
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,460
-Wait a second.
-Forget it.

529
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,380
It's not why I told you.

530
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,080
-I came to tell you...
-Here it is.

531
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:32,040
...the story. I don't... No. Forget it.
I'm shocked. I will not accept any money.

532
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,000
Did he say he'll pay it back
with interest?

533
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:38,460
You're acting crazy. Shir, I'm asking you.
I don't want any money.

534
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,920
-It's okay. Wait a second.
-I'm asking you.

535
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,460
This is really stupid.
This isn't what I meant.

536
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:47,830
I'm not... Forget it.
I'm asking you, Shir.

537
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,750
I just came

538
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:53,710
-to tell you because I thought it might...
-I'm putting today's date.

539
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,630
...somehow help.

540
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,540
No, I'm asking you.

541
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,540
No, I don't want it.

542
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,500
No, I refuse. No, no.

543
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,960
It's okay. Doron, take it. Doron!

544
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,670
I'm asking you, Shir. I don't want this...

545
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,920
-You're putting me in a tough spot.
-It's okay, take it.

546
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,790
Everything's fine.

547
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,920
Call me.

548
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,500
-Tommy?
-It's me.

549
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,210
Hi. Where are you?

550
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,920
I'm here.

551
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,130
Where "here"?

552
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,380
Look out the window.

553
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,130
Hi.

554
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,500
Come on up.

555
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,920
C'mon, Shir.

556
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,080
-What?
-Are you serious?

557
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,540
-You don't want to come up?
-No.

558
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,420
So why did you come?

559
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,580
Because you asked me to.

560
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,460
I asked you to come because I need you.
I need you near me right now.

561
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,130
Come be with me here.

562
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,580
C'mon, we're going to stand together
on the street?

563
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,130
Let's go to my place.

564
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,500
I'm not going to your place!

565
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,540
So, let's go eat.
I haven't eaten since lunch.

566
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,420
I can't leave now. If there's some new
development, I need to be here.

567
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,290
You mean, if he shows up.

568
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,380
I'm not leaving this house,
do you understand?

569
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,710
Come on up! I'm losing my mind!

570
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:42,500
What if he shows up while I'm there?
What will you say, if he asks who I am?

571
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,790
Maybe he's waiting for me to come up.
Maybe he's hiding behind a tree.

572
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,290
Peeking out, waiting for me to come up
to catch us together.

573
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,750
Stop talking nonsense.

574
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,920
I'm serious.

575
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,080
Come on up!

576
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:58,000
I don't want him to know, I told you that.
I don't want to get mixed up in this.

577
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,790
Oh, c'mon. Will you please come up?

578
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,710
All I'm fucking asking you is to come up
and be with me.

579
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,750
Look, Shir, I'm not coming up.
If you want, you can come down here.

580
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,750
Coward.

581
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,580
Fine, you can think I'm a coward.

582
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,380
That's what you are, a coward.

583
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,420
No, you're a coward.

584
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,960
You live with a husband you don't love.
You're cheating on him,

585
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,380
afraid he'll find out the truth.

586
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,420
I don't want to get mixed up in this shit.
I told you from the start.

587
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,210
Why do you think I don't love him?

588
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,500
You do?

589
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,170
It's none of your business.

590
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,080
What?

591
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,920
How do you know something happened to him?

592
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,670
-Because I know.
-How?

593
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,500
Because I know! I know him!

594
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,420
That's what you think. He probably thinks
he knows you too.

595
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
Quit the crap and come up already!

596
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,080
Don't you understand it's a horrible idea?

597
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,040
If I come up there and he shows up,
who knows what he'll do.

598
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,750
What are you afraid he's going to
beat you up?

599
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,630
Why should I get mixed up in this?
You have a fucked up marriage.

600
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,670
I told you from the start,
I don't need this shit.

601
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,580
You don't need this shit, but you need me?

602
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,000
-Yes.
-Great!

603
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:40,040
Great! Nice arrangement
you've got going here.

604
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:41,710
You weren't exactly against it either.

605
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,750
Tommy, listen.

606
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:46,960
If you care about me, even a little,

607
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,330
you'll come up.

608
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,960
-You hear me?
-Yes.

609
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,210
Don't leave me here alone.

610
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,540
-Do you care about me?
-You know I do.

611
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,500
So why don't you come up?

612
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,420
Because it's fucked up!
Your husband's missing

613
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,330
and I should sit with you
until he comes back?

614
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,290
Feel sorry for you? Pretend I care what
happened to him? It's fucked up!

615
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,580
You don't have to pretend. You can
rejoice, if that's what you feel.

616
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,670
I don't feel that. Why would I feel that?

617
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,330
You wouldn't want him to disappear?

618
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,960
What do I have to do with this?

619
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,210
Maybe you're happy, it's your right.
I have nothing to do with this.

620
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,460
Say...

621
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,290
you...

622
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,290
did something to Rami?

623
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,210
What?

624
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,250
Did you do something to him?

625
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,250
Why would I do anything to him?

626
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,710
To be with me?

627
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,460
You think I did something to your husband,
so that you and I can be together?

628
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,670
I don't think anything. I'm asking.

629
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,500
Listen. Darling.

630
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:02,210
If I wanted us to be together,
it would've happened already.

631
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,500
Your idiot husband has nothing
to do with this.

632
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,580
Got it?

633
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,920
Yes, I got it.

634
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:12,040
Inside a wall stands a man

635
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:18,080
All alone he stands in there

636
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:24,710
Who knows the man in the wall

637
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,920
The man's been standing
inside the wall since long ago

638
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,920
He can't get out of here

639
00:42:55,130 --> 00:43:01,210
Who knows the man in the wall

640
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:24,630
The man is small, the wall is huge

641
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,790
The man is weak, the wall is strong

642
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:37,210
Who knows the man in the wall

643
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,040
Anybody here?

644
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,330
-Mommy.
-Hey, sweetie.

645
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,460
Wow, mom!

646
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,920
-You were at the door?
-No, no.

647
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,580
It was the neighbors, asking to turn down
the music. Said it's very late.

648
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:56,210
-You saw me dancing?
-You danced beautifully!

649
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,460
You always danced beautifully.

650
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,250
And you sang beautifully too.

651
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:04,130
Sing something.

652
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,750
No, c'mon.

653
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,250
-Why not?
-I'm embarrassed to sing.

654
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,830
You're probably wondering
what I'm doing here.

655
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,420
No.

656
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,000
I know what you're doing here.

657
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:27,830
I thought how nice it would be,
if you were here.

658
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,750
But, sweetie, I can't stay for long.

659
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,670
Why?

660
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,330
I have things to do.

661
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:42,790
What things, Mom? You're dead.

662
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:45,000
Please, don't say that!

663
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:48,250
Mom! Mom, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! Forgive me!

664
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:51,670
I'm sorry. I apologize.

665
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,460
-Do you want to eat something?
-What?

666
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,670
Do you want to eat something?
You haven't eaten all night.

667
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,630
No, no. I'm not hungry.

668
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,710
It's not good. You have to eat something.

669
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,330
Let's see what you have
and I'll make you something good.

670
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,670
Mom. Mom, I'm not hungry!

671
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:14,290
Why is Rami not here?

672
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:18,040
He needs to be here, take care of you,
make sure that you're eating.

673
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:20,250
Leaves his drugs and walks away.

674
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:21,920
-Enough, mom.
-It's not right.

675
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:23,580
It's really not right.

676
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,380
You have nothing in the fridge!
How can I make anything...

677
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,830
Enough, Mother! I told you I'm not hungry!

678
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,380
Bruno?

679
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,920
Bruno?

680
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:29,500
Bruno. My beautiful boy.

681
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,330
Bruno, maybe you can tell me.

682
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,960
Where's Rami?

683
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:42,670
Maybe...

684
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:46,130
Where is he?

685
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,170
Where is he?

686
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,170
Where is he? Answer me.
Where is he? Where is he?

687
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:53,170
What?

688
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:25,920
Anybody here?

689
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,670
Anybody here?

690
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,330
Who is it?

691
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:42,080
Who is it?

692
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,500
Who's there?

693
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:13,040
It's for you. Thought you might be hungry.

694
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,000
Can I come in?

695
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:41,130
These helped you?

696
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:43,080
What?

697
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,040
The pills helped? You've calmed down?

698
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,380
-A bit.
-How many did you take?

699
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,540
-Oh, c'mon.
-Shir, how many did you take?

700
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,460
Two.

701
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:53,290
Two?

702
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,960
I smoked a joint.
I had crazy hallucinations.

703
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,250
You smoked a joint, took two of these
and you had wine?

704
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,290
Please, let me eat in peace, okay?

705
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,710
Is it good anyway?

706
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,330
You're going to keep standing?

707
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:17,670
Or maybe you'll take a seat?

708
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:26,210
Why didn't you bring me a Pepsi?

709
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:27,500
They didn't have any.

710
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:28,830
So, get me some water.

711
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:56,080
Thanks.

712
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:58,830
So, this is where you live?

713
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:02,130
Yes.

714
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:08,210
Rami's study is there, past the bedroom.
You can take a tour, if you want.

715
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,670
Nice apartment.

716
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,830
You really think so?

717
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:51,670
Yes. Nice apartment.

718
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:55,080
I had a similar apartment when I was
your age. Not far from here actually.

719
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,290
Come here maybe?

720
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:10,710
Hug me.

721
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,040
Thank you. Thank you, thanks.

722
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:48,670
I knew you'd come.

723
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,210
-You didn't know.
-I knew.

724
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:02,130
It's so scary being alone.
You have no idea.

725
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,710
Shir...

726
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,920
Hey, Shir. C'mon, what are you doing?

727
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:36,130
Caress me.

728
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:43,580
Shir.

729
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:46,670
-Open it.
-Shir!

730
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:49,170
Open it!

731
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:20,250
Get up! Get up!

732
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,210
Go to the bedroom. Under the bed.

733
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,500
Faster, faster!

734
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,330
One moment.

735
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,210
-Hi.
-Dudi!

736
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,540
I called like a hundred times.
You didn't answer.

737
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:55,960
Really?

738
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,960
The battery probably died.

739
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,670
Well, I'll check.

740
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,630
-Weren't you up north?
-I was. He didn't return?

741
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,290
No.

742
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:11,170
Can I come in?

743
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:13,540
Sure.

744
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,330
Do you want to drink something?

745
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:33,790
Yes. Tea maybe. I...

746
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,250
I have a bit of a cold.

747
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,630
There's no tea. We ran out.

748
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:41,500
Okay, water then.

749
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:44,580
Okay.

750
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:52,170
So...

751
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,750
Nothing. No news.

752
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:02,960
What about the police?

753
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:05,500
I talked to them.
There were no incidents in the area.

754
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,000
No one was brought to the hospital.

755
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:10,000
Nothing new.
They'll start searching tomorrow.

756
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:13,710
-So what do we do now?
-Nothing. There's nothing we can do now.

757
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,540
Nothing. We have to wait 'till morning.

758
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:22,880
We can't wait 'till morning.

759
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,210
-What do you want to do?
-Go look for him.

760
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,750
-Where?
-Here in the area.

761
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,790
The cops looked in the area.
Didn't find anything.

762
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,540
You said they'll begin searching tomorrow.

763
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:34,630
No. There were patrol officers here.
The extended search will begin tomorrow.

764
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,710
You trust these patrol officers?

765
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:40,460
Yes. I don't know.

766
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,790
Okay, well, I don't trust them.
It's Friday night,

767
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,670
-it's raining. They couldn't care less.
-I looked too, in the whole neighborhood.

768
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,080
What do you think?

769
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:51,040
So what do you want?

770
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:53,500
That we'll just sit here
hoping for the best?

771
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:55,000
There's nothing to do now, Dudi.

772
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,580
I'll talk to you in the morning.

773
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,380
-What's up?
-What?

774
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:04,670
You're talking like it's...

775
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:07,580
-Dudi, I did everything.
-Okay, forget it.

776
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,960
-Where are you going?
-I'll do it by myself.

777
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:12,630
Where... What will you do by yourself?
What are you doing?

778
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:14,920
-If you don't care, you can sit and wait.
-What?

779
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,920
-I can't do that.
-I don't care?

780
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,630
-You have some nerve!
-Okay.

781
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:22,080
-I don't care? You decided I don't care?
-Fine.

782
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,380
-Go fuck yourself!
-Okay.

783
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:26,630
Listen, Dudi, you can't come here
and talk like this in my house.

784
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:27,750
-Okay, Shir.
-Get out.

785
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:29,920
Shir, he might be lying
somewhere out there!

786
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,880
Bleeding or dying or whatever!
And you want to sit here,

787
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,420
-drink wine, eat noodles and wait for him?
-I told you, I already did everything!

788
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,880
Okay, fine, Shir! I would've never
thought you're like this!

789
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,210
-Like what?
-Okay, fine.

790
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:42,630
Like what? You would've never
thought that I'm like what?

791
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:45,250
What difference does it make now?
That's what's important now?

792
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,750
-Yes, yes! Like what?
-Okay, fine.

793
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,750
Dudi!

794
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:52,290
Just...

795
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:05,210
Tell me, Dudi.

796
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:07,920
Is Rami seeing someone?

797
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,580
-What?
-Is he having an affair?

798
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:14,880
One-night stands?

799
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,790
Are you serious?

800
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,250
Damn serious.

801
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:24,960
No, Shir. He's not seeing anyone. Okay?

802
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:27,580
No one-night stands. No nothing.

803
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,500
-As far as I know anyway.
-Who's Ella S.?

804
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:37,250
Ella S. Look how many outgoing calls.

805
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,080
-I don't know. Let's call.
-I called. Twice. No answer.

806
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,040
Call again.

807
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,000
Dudi, what did he tell you about me?

808
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:57,790
-When?
-In general. You talk about me, right?

809
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,330
The call is forwarded to voicemail.

810
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:01,750
What did he say?

811
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:05,380
Nothing special.

812
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,710
And still...

813
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,710
-Nothing. He said nothing.
-Nothing?

814
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:16,330
Did he say he wants to leave me?

815
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,250
No.

816
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,380
Tell me the truth.

817
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,750
-He didn't say he wants to leave you.
-So what did he say?

818
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,330
Dudi. Talk!

819
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:29,790
What?

820
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,000
Nothing. He said that...

821
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:33,670
He said you lost your sense of humor.

822
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,170
What does it mean?

823
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:41,170
Nothing. That when you met
you had a great sense of humor

824
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,130
and lately it vanished.

825
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,710
What?

826
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,790
He told you a joke and you didn't laugh.

827
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,460
-What joke?
-It doesn't matter, Shir.

828
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,670
What joke?

829
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:56,630
About mice and football.

830
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,790
I don't remember.

831
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,630
-It doesn't matter now.
-Tell me.

832
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:02,330
What?

833
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,460
-Tell me the joke!
-It's inappropriate now, Shir.

834
01:00:04,830 --> 01:00:06,420
I want you to tell me that joke.

835
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:09,790
-Now? What for?
-Dudi, can you tell me the joke already?

836
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:17,130
A man goes to the doctor, says,

837
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:19,710
"Doctor, I've been having the same
weird dream for a month.

838
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:21,880
White mice playing football."

839
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:26,710
Okay? No big deal. The doctor says:
"Take these pills. Tomorrow it'll stop."

840
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:31,460
So, the man says: "Thanks, doctor, but
I'll start taking the pills the day after.

841
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:33,250
It's just that... tomorrow is the finals."

842
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,750
-Remember?
-Yes.

843
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:45,710
-You find it funny?
-Yes.

844
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,710
This is what you talk about?
These sort of things?

845
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:50,830
That I don't laugh at his stupid jokes!

846
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,460
-About that too.
-Only about that, it seems.

847
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,250
Cracking up, talking crap.

848
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:58,460
Your best friend disappears and you have
no idea where he can be.

849
01:00:58,540 --> 01:00:59,960
-Oh, and you do?
-Dudi...

850
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:03,170
Come, come. Get out.

851
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,540
I'll call you in the morning.

852
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:08,630
-No, no. I'm staying here.
-Dudi!

853
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:09,540
No.

854
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,000
You have no business here.

855
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:15,380
It doesn't help me.

856
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:18,130
I didn't come to help you. It's my friend
and I'm worried about him.

857
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:21,540
-Do you have to worry about him here?
-You're afraid I'll know someone was here?

858
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:30,000
He hates umbrellas.

859
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,790
He never had an umbrella.

860
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:35,080
It's Nadav's umbrella.
Adi's new boyfriend.

861
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:39,630
They were here. I forgot they were coming
with everything that happened.

862
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:43,540
So, you drank wine
and ate noodles with them?

863
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,790
Yes, I was with them, eating and
drinking food and everything.

864
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:50,500
-What do you want? That I'll stop eating?
-Okay.

865
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,420
-I got it. I'm going to go look for him.
-Goodbye.

866
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:55,000
-You're coming with me?
-No.

867
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:56,920
-Why not?
-Because.

868
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,420
What if he comes back?

869
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:00,330
If he comes back, Shir, he has a key.

870
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:03,210
He'll come in, see that you're not here
and he'll call you.

871
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:04,630
And I want to meet him here.

872
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,380
Tell me something. This Nadav...

873
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,960
So?

874
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:17,420
-What about him?
-He forgot his shoes too?

875
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:24,670
Those are Rami's shoes.

876
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:35,330
47? These are not Rami's.

877
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:21,500
-I'm here. Come down.
-Hello?

878
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:24,040
-Hello.
-Who is this?

879
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:26,420
It's Shir. Rami's wife.

880
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:27,750
Where's Rami?

881
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,290
Who's asking?

882
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:30,880
Tell him it's Ella.

883
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:34,040
Ella, he can't talk now.

884
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,460
Can you come up here, please?

885
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:38,290
No. Where's Rami?

886
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:41,460
He... He's not home.

887
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:43,080
He called me.

888
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:45,670
No, it was me who called you.

889
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:46,960
What? Why?

890
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:50,040
I wanted to ask you some stuff.

891
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:51,880
Do you know who I am?

892
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:53,580
-No.
-Sure?

893
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:54,960
Yes.

894
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,750
-Rami didn't tell you about me?
-No.

895
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:59,080
Okay, so what can I do for you?

896
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,130
Maybe you know where he is?

897
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,330
I have no idea. Something happened to him?

898
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:09,670
I think so. He disappeared.
Do you work together?

899
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:11,000
No.

900
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:14,790
What's your connection to him?

901
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:16,960
What did you say your name was?

902
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:18,380
Shir.

903
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:22,130
Shir, sorry, I can't help you.
I have no idea where your husband is.

904
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,830
Ella, you said you're here.
Why did you come here?

905
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,170
I was in the neighborhood.

906
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:29,750
Listen, Ella, I don't believe you,
so I want you to tell me who you are.

907
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:31,880
It's none of your business. Bye.

908
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:34,380
-I'm calling the police!
-What?

909
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:37,540
I'm calling the police and I'm giving them
your number and your name.

910
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:41,130
-I'll say you know something about Rami.
-Why would you do that?

911
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:44,040
Because you won't tell me who you are.
You're hiding something

912
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,000
and that something might help find Rami.

913
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:51,250
Hello? Ella?

914
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:52,960
Is there anyone else in the apartment?

915
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:54,500
No.

916
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:55,960
-Sure?
-Yes.

917
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,880
-Open the door, I'm coming up. What floor?
-Second.

918
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:24,630
What did you say your name was?

919
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,080
-Shir.
-Shir. I don't know

920
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:31,080
where Rami is or what happened to him.
I'm not his friend, not his lover.

921
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:34,290
I have no idea where he is, so there's
no need to call the police, okay?

922
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,130
Really? You get a call from him
in the middle of the night.

923
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:39,330
You get here in 30 minutes
and tell him to come down.

924
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:41,460
You're telling me
you don't know who he is?

925
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,540
I didn't say I don't know who he is.
I said I have no personal ties to him.

926
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:57,290
Okay? I sell him drugs.

927
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,250
Look, I'm not a drug dealer.
I just have a few regulars.

928
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,250
They call during my work hours.

929
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:09,880
If everything's cool, I don't answer
and stop by within an hour.

930
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:15,250
They come down, say "Hi", get the stuff,
we say goodbye. That's how it works.

931
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:19,670
Rami is a regular. He called, I came.
Okay? Good.

932
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,210
How do you know him?

933
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:26,250
My brother's a musician.
Rami did some mix for him

934
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:29,920
-or a cover. We smoked a bit, he liked it.
-He bought from you recently?

935
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:32,000
Yes, about a week ago.

936
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:35,670
-Is it pot?
-Pot? No.

937
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:39,420
I don't do the small stuff.
Only the real thing.

938
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,170
Which is what?

939
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:43,380
You want to buy?

940
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:45,170
-No.
-So, why do you care?

941
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:46,790
I want to know what it is.

942
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,750
I smoked something today that...

943
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,170
Probably something Rami bought from you.

944
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,330
I experienced weird things.

945
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,540
Naturally! It's supposed to do
weird things. It's the real deal.

946
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:00,330
So what is it?

947
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:03,880
-You want know what it's called?
-For instance...

948
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,580
It doesn't matter. Only I have it.
Trust me.

949
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:10,920
-How do you know only you have it?
-I make it.

950
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:13,000
What do you make it from?

951
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:17,210
-Horse shit! What's with the third degree?
-Did he buy a lot from you?

952
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:19,290
-Define "a lot".
-I don't know. In a week.

953
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:22,330
What does it matter how many times a week?
The quantity is what matters...

954
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:23,250
Okay...

955
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,250
Is it measured in grams or what?
I don't know how this thing's measured.

956
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:30,460
He didn't buy a lot. Average.
Said it helps him with work.

957
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:32,540
Opens his hearing.

958
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:35,080
So, it causes hallucinations?

959
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:37,460
Only in the beginning. Then it works out.

960
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:39,790
It...

961
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:42,250
opens all kinds of stuff, you know?

962
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:44,920
All kinds of stuff.

963
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:50,080
You sure you don't want to buy?
I'm here anyway.

964
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:51,710
Yes.

965
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:54,040
You want to smoke together?

966
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:57,000
-No.
-Well, can I smoke?

967
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,000
-Okay.
-Good, great.

968
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:05,580
I...

969
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,040
basically hate apartments.

970
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,540
Fucking hate them!

971
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,080
It drives you crazy!

972
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:16,460
Know what I'm saying?

973
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:20,420
-Where do you live?
-In an apartment, where else?

974
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:21,580
On the street?

975
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:30,580
What's that?

976
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,790
It smells like pot.

977
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:35,630
Pot!

978
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,750
Of course, I add a little.

979
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:44,000
It's for the smell. Otherwise it stinks.

980
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,000
Horse shit, I'm telling you.

981
01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:50,040
Is it expensive, this stuff?

982
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,000
Define "expensive".

983
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,880
Say, 20,000. How much can you buy?

984
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:57,500
20,000 is serious.

985
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,580
But... Rami didn't spend
that kind of money.

986
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,250
-Are you sure?
-Totally, girl.

987
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,000
You said you're his wife?

988
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:09,790
Yes.

989
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:13,000
Weird.

990
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:15,580
He didn't tell me about you.

991
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:23,210
Okay.

992
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:26,500
-What?
-Never mind.

993
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:32,130
Okay, fine. So what did he tell you?

994
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:35,250
Forget it.

995
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:40,000
Nothing, really.

996
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,460
Don't worry, he didn't spill
his heart out to me.

997
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,290
He only said it helps him.

998
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:50,130
Opens his hearing.

999
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:52,960
He didn't try to hit on me either.

1000
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:56,000
He's cool, Rami.

1001
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,540
So, what, he just disappeared?

1002
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:05,290
Yes.

1003
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:08,880
Took the dog out for a walk and...

1004
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:13,960
Didn't come back. Disappeared.

1005
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:17,420
So weird.

1006
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,830
It's so weird that people disappear.

1007
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:24,710
So weird! I saw this American TV show once

1008
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:27,130
about a unit trying to
locate missing persons.

1009
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:28,670
And there was this

1010
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,880
-sort of...
-Was it?

1011
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:31,920
What?

1012
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:34,130
Could this stuff

1013
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,540
do something like...

1014
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:40,210
For someone like Rami, who smoked.

1015
01:10:40,830 --> 01:10:42,710
Could it have fucked up his brain?

1016
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,960
That's the point.

1017
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:53,130
What? Fuck up your brain?

1018
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:54,540
Yes.

1019
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:57,330
-Why?
-What "why"?

1020
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,500
Why do you sell something
that fucks up the brain?

1021
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:04,130
Because it's going to get fucked up
eventually, one way or the other.

1022
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:06,960
So you should at least enjoy the process.

1023
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:11,170
Something might've happened to Rami
because he smoked this stuff!

1024
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,210
How the hell do I know.

1025
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:16,080
Depends, you know.
It's not like he'll vanish.

1026
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:21,000
Okay, but what can happen to him?
What can happen to him from this stuff?

1027
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,790
How the hell do I know.
It depends on the person.

1028
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:26,920
Get it? It has a different effect
on different people.

1029
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:31,500
It does nothing for me now.
I just get a little buzz.

1030
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,960
Long ago, when I smoked,
I'd go to the park.

1031
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,290
I'd smoke and

1032
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:39,420
-look towards the sun...
-Tell me!

1033
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:41,250
Close my eyes and it was
fucking Christmas!

1034
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:42,500
-Hold on!
-For an hour!

1035
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,670
You don't care?

1036
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:47,080
-You really don't care?
-What?

1037
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,500
Something bad happened to a person because
of this shit you sold him

1038
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:54,710
and you don't care?

1039
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,330
C'mon, girl. Where you born yesterday?

1040
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,880
It's pot. It's just pot.

1041
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:14,380
Fucking awesome pot. Medical.

1042
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:18,250
My uncle's terminally ill.
He gets tons of it, but it's just pot.

1043
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:23,830
Lighten up. I fooled you.

1044
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,460
It was a joke. Laugh.

1045
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:31,000
Smile. Anything!

1046
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:35,330
You look like you're in mourning. I can't
see people like this. It's depressing.

1047
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,250
It'll be okay.

1048
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:38,250
Rami will come back. Don't worry.

1049
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:39,500
Okay, listen.

1050
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,130
Fuck off from my house. Now! Get out!

1051
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,460
Come on, get up!

1052
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,170
Stupid girl!

1053
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:49,750
You stupid little girl! Get out!

1054
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:54,750
Okay, now I'm really depressed.

1055
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,000
Fine.

1056
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:01,830
Okay then.

1057
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:04,580
Bye!

1058
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,250
Say "Hi" to Rami. If he comes back.

1059
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:31,380
Ambiance. Traffic's flowing.

1060
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:38,500
Ambiance. Highway. Traffic jam.

1061
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,630
Empty alley. Ambiance.

1062
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:51,290
Man walking down an alley.

1063
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,960
Man running down an alley.

1064
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,540
Woman walking down an alley.

1065
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:04,500
Woman running down an alley.

1066
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:09,170
Man and woman walking down an alley.

1067
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:14,880
Man and woman running down an alley.

1068
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:18,040
Ambiance. Empty apartment. Day.

1069
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:23,630
Ambiance. Woman. Night.

1070
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,630
Apartment. Night.

1071
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,580
-Hi.
-Hi.

1072
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:57,500
-How are you?
-Good. What's up?

1073
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:00,500
-It's all good.
-Hungry?

1074
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:02,670
No, I ate.

1075
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:04,830
What did you make?

1076
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,580
Nothing. I thought we'd order in.

1077
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:09,250
You didn't eat anything?

1078
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,000
I made a pastrami sandwich.

1079
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,080
So, order in something.

1080
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:15,130
It's okay, I'm not really hungry.

1081
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,830
Maybe I'll make another sandwich.

1082
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:19,830
Suit yourself.

1083
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,710
-There's hot water?
-Yes.

1084
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,960
I asked you not to touch my computer!

1085
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,540
Did I or did I not ask you?

1086
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,080
My sweet boy.

1087
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:47,500
What is it? What is it? What is it?

1088
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:49,330
I missed you.

1089
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:51,960
I missed you, my pretty boy.

1090
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:53,710
I missed you.

1091
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,420
You mind telling me where you were?

1092
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,420
In the neighborhood.

1093
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:16,130
-In the neighborhood?
-Yes.

1094
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:27,000
Rami, I want to know where you were.

1095
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:28,920
I told you. In the neighborhood.

1096
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,210
Where here in the neighborhood?

1097
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:33,000
In the neighborhood! What does it matter?

1098
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:35,080
What do you mean, "what does it matter"?

1099
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:38,210
What were you doing?

1100
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:39,500
Nothing special.

1101
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:41,920
-Nothing special?
-Yes.

1102
01:16:44,170 --> 01:16:45,830
Okay, keep sleeping.

1103
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:56,000
Rami, where were you?

1104
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:08,290
Well?

1105
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:12,040
Where were you?

1106
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:14,830
Where were you? Where were you? Where?

1107
01:17:16,830 --> 01:17:18,330
Do you know what you did to me?

1108
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,670
Maybe you don't know what you did to me!

1109
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:24,830
I called hospitals!
The police is looking for you!

1110
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:27,080
No one's looking for me.
No one's looking for me.

1111
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:29,710
Cops were here, they're were looking
for you. They're still are.

1112
01:17:29,790 --> 01:17:32,330
I know. I know they were here.
I called the police.

1113
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,500
I told them everything's fine.

1114
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:37,000
I came back home and they shouldn't worry.

1115
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:41,670
You know?

1116
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:46,130
-How do you know?
-I listened.

1117
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:49,750
-What did you listen to?
-Everything that happened here.

1118
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:53,750
I put wireless microphones
all over the house.

1119
01:17:54,130 --> 01:17:56,000
I was outside listening all this time.

1120
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:02,290
What?

1121
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:06,540
-You're lying.
-No.

1122
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:17,630
-Shir, he's fucked up, I told you.
-He hit me once.

1123
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:19,830
You live with a husband you don't love.
You cheat...

1124
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
What?

1125
01:18:26,130 --> 01:18:28,080
Where were you? You're lying!

1126
01:18:28,710 --> 01:18:30,330
-Tell me where you were.
-I'm not lying.

1127
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:31,920
I was curious, that's all.

1128
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,130
What do you, "curious"?

1129
01:18:34,330 --> 01:18:36,710
I was curious to know what goes on here
when I'm not around.

1130
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,380
I mean...

1131
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:42,630
When I'm here, it's no longer interesting.

1132
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,040
Know what I'm saying?

1133
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:54,290
-Now can I go to sleep?
-No, you can't go to sleep! Are you lying?

1134
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:03,210
The 20,000 too?

1135
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:05,750
No. I didn't need Doron's money.

1136
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,630
So why did you ask him for it?

1137
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,380
To make sure he'll be here tonight.

1138
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:10,380
You're sick!

1139
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,880
You're sick! Crazy! You must be

1140
01:20:14,130 --> 01:20:15,750
a pervert to do something like this.

1141
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:20,330
Would've been better if you died,
if something ever happened to you!

1142
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:28,000
-This is funny to you?
-No. It's just that

1143
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,460
You know, your Tommy has a nice voice.

1144
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:32,920
If you're going to listen to your wife
fucking someone else,

1145
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:34,420
he might as well have a nice voice.

1146
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,920
Watch it!

1147
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,830
Watch it! I'll kill you!

1148
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,250
-Shir, calm down!
-Leave me alone!

1149
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:42,960
-Leave me alone, I said! Leave me alone!
-Calm down! Calm down!

1150
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,460
-Calm down!
-Leave me alone!

1151
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:46,540
-Calm! Down!
-Rami, leave me alone.

1152
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:47,830
Calm down!

1153
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:50,250
-Calm down. Calm down!
-Rami, leave...

1154
01:20:50,830 --> 01:20:52,630
-Rami!
-Calm down!

1155
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:54,380
Enough, Rami!

1156
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,580
Calm down!

1157
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:01,290
Calm down.

1158
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:04,250
Enough.

1159
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:05,380
Enough! I can't...

1160
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:31,380
Bitch!

1161
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,000
I'm going to enter the house,

1162
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:42,710
take all my things and get out.

1163
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,380
You will go to your room.

1164
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
If you try to come near me, I'll kill you.

1165
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,420
I swear I will kill you.

1166
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,040
Got it?

1167
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:51,170
-Shir?
-Go to your room!

1168
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:53,630
-Take Bruno with you.
-Go to the room!

1169
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:17,250
-Shir, please take Bruno!
-Go to your room!

1170
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:20,790
It's your dog!

1171
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:22,920
I'm not going to take care of your dog!

1172
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:40,710
Rami?

1173
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:47,670
Who is it?

1174
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:51,830
Did you take pills?

1175
01:23:55,170 --> 01:23:57,170
You swallowed all the pills in the bottle?

1176
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:00,580
How long ago?

1177
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:04,250
How long ago?

1178
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:06,500
15 minutes. Maybe a bit more.

1179
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:41,000
-911. Hello.
-Hello.

1180
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:44,460
-I need an ambulance, please.
-What happened?

1181
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:49,710
My husband tried to commit suicide. He
swallowed pills. Tranquilizers. A bottle.

1182
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,000
-Yes.
-How long ago?

1183
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,630
15 minutes ago.

1184
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:58,670
I don't know. He doesn't answer.

1185
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:00,380
He doesn't look good.

1186
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:03,500
Okay, okay.

1187
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:05,420
Yes, I'll tell him. Okay.

1188
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:07,540
20 Hagefen street.

1189
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:11,580
Second floor. Apartment 3.

1190
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,670
Thank you.

1191
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:17,080
Yes, yes. Thank you.

1192
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:21,580
You need tot throw up now.

1193
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:25,420
-Why did you do that for?
-Get up, you need to throw up.

1194
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,080
Why did you do that for?

1195
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:30,880
Go stick a finger down your throat!
You need to throw up now!

1196
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,460
-Why did you do that for?
-Because!

1197
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:34,500
-Answer me.
-Because I don't want you to die now.

1198
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:35,880
Die tomorrow when I leave.

1199
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:38,830
Now you don't die. Get up.

1200
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:42,040
Go stick a finger.

1201
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:02,210
-It's not working.
-Sweetie, stick a finger.

1202
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:05,250
-It's not working. When will they be here?
-Just stick a finger!

1203
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:10,210
Well?

1204
01:26:13,630 --> 01:26:14,790
Let me.

1205
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:19,040
Open wider!

1206
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:20,380
Open!

1207
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:35,130
Good, Rami. Way to go.

1208
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:41,130
That's it?

1209
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:46,960
Good.

1210
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:53,750
Here, wipe yourself up.

1211
01:26:55,130 --> 01:26:56,920
Careful. I'll get you some water, wait.

1212
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:08,960
Rami, here. Drink.

1213
01:27:09,710 --> 01:27:10,830
Drink all of it.

1214
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,250
C'mon, Rami!

1215
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:24,580
Get up, get up.

1216
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:28,250
Get up, get up, get up!

1217
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,000
Enough. Get up. Go to the room.

1218
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:37,420
Good. Way to go.

1219
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:39,670
Thank you.

1220
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,750
Go lie down a bit.

1221
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,540
-Give me the blanket. I'm cold.
-I'll get it, hold on.

1222
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:04,000
Hold on, I'll get you some more water.

1223
01:28:36,130 --> 01:28:38,290
Enough, Bruno! Bruno, enough!

1224
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:42,170
Enough. Enough, Bruno. Enough.

1225
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,330
Okay, I'm coming.

1226
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:00,080
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1227
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:11,750
Come on.

1228
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:31,040
Come, my boy. Come.
