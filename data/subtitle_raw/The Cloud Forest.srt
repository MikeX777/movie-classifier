1
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:34,935
Cloud forests are one of
Mexico's most bio diverse ecosystems...

2
00:00:34,936 --> 00:00:37,411
...as well as one of the most
threatened rain forests in the world.

3
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,289
Since 1996, in Veracruz,
a small community...

4
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,457
...has devoted itself to the
reforestation of an old cattle ranch.

5
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,335
There is a co-op
in this place today...

6
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,295
...where each partner
plays an important role...

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,380
...in the community's
development...

8
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,215
...thereby attempting
to live modestly...

9
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:50,967
...and harmoniously with
their environment.

10
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:20,181
Some time ago there were
some lumberjacks felling trees;

11
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:25,061
...but, one day, not all
of them went to work.

12
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,688
Just one kid went...

13
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:32,277
...whom they ordered to cut
down a huge tree, a very pretty one.

14
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:38,700
He sharpened his axe and began
cutting into the trunk.

15
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,870
All of a sudden he heard
a very strange noise...

16
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,248
...and the noise kept
growing louder.

17
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,085
He just stood there, and he wanted
to go find out what it was;

18
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:53,590
...but, then he saw something
like a mountain lion.

19
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,428
Those animals had never
been seen around here before.

20
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,099
So, when the kid went home,

21
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:06,519
he told the other lumberjacks
what had happened...

22
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,480
...and the guys made
fun of him, and said:

23
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:13,276
"We'll go tomorrow and
see what it's all about."

24
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,407
They went back again...

25
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,786
...and saw the tree they
intended to cut down...

26
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,373
...and they heard
new strange sounds...

27
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,626
...unlike the ones made by the animal
that had chased the kid off.

28
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:34,714
Then they saw like
four or five chaneques.

29
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,884
The kid got spooked and said
he saw them around here,

30
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,178
looking like wood sprites.

31
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,347
The sprites spoke
and told them...

32
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,433
...not to cut down that tree
because it belonged to them...

33
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,728
...and that they should
never come back again...

34
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,774
...because they were the
guardians of that forest.

35
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,464
What is it, baby?

36
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,594
Want a toy?

37
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,394
Easy.

38
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,229
If you can.
Otherwise, leave it.

39
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,564
It's easy.
That one there.

40
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,649
From there.
The branches will break off.

41
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:52,819
Pull it! Yeah, but
don't drop it all on me!

42
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,107
All done.

43
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,534
- This enough?
- Will this do?

44
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,953
Yes, that's good.

45
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:48,166
Remember last week when
we discussed permaculture?

46
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,377
- Yes!
- OK

47
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,838
What did we say?
That there were what principles?

48
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,007
-Ethical.
-Ethical.

49
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,084
- And design-related.
- And design-related.

50
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:02,639
Celebrate abundance,
share equally.

51
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,351
- Everything has to be equally
- I want examples.

52
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,562
You have your
water tank for a week...

53
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:14,150
...and, if you use it up
before the week is over...

54
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,986
...you can't have it recharged.

55
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,656
Rationing water.
Do you think it's a good idea?

56
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,491
- It's for Huatusco, for instance?
- Yes.

57
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:23,993
But first you need to
make an estimate, because...

58
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:28,289
...maybe one tank is not
enough for you.

59
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,042
Depends on how many liters.

60
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:32,627
Depends on what?

61
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:33,753
Depends on how many liters.

62
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,923
It depends on how many liters it
holds, our consumption, and?

63
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,550
And how many people
live at home.

64
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,594
- How many people?
- And how much the tank costs...

65
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,681
...because maybe some
people can't afford the tank...

66
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,400
...and, if they don't have a tank,
they won't get any water.

67
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,478
Great. There's the solution,
or a proposal of one...

68
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:54,232
...but it must be analyzed
from different points of view.

69
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,525
What good is it?

70
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,402
No, it's a good idea.

71
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,239
It's good because it
rations resources...

72
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,732
...and it's intended for them...

73
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,325
...to be shared equally.

74
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:09,039
Now, what are these
ethical principles for?

75
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,512
The last one.

76
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,270
Did TejÃ³n leave right
away on Saturday?

77
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:16,773
Yeah, he wanted to
leave even before that;

78
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,819
...but, since we were
going to take him...

79
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,363
...I asked him to wait for me.

80
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,990
He needed to go see his
cows before nightfall.

81
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:33,790
TejÃ³n had a new female calf,
bull calf, no, female, right?

82
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,626
What a pretty animal that was!

83
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,255
- So he has good animals?
- Yeah.

84
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:45,385
Yeah. And the other
one's about to calve too...

85
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:46,928
...the one that refused.

86
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,267
You didn't go to the
carnival yesterday.

87
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,103
- What for? I fell asleep.
- To get a couple of beers!

88
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,399
I've got my Tecate girls on my
calendar, no need to go see them there.

89
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,590
The ecosystems I mentioned
are marked in green, that is...

90
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:26,968
...low rainforest, high
rainforest, mangrove swamps,

91
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,720
...cloud forest,
pine and oak forestsâ€¦

92
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,256
This is how the state looked
like before the Conquest.

93
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,891
This is how it looked supposedly...

94
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:36,519
...and,
this is actual scientific data...

95
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:39,356
...this is how it looked like in 2002.

96
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:43,193
What was left in color,
what you see in green...

97
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:47,447
...is what's left from the
original vegetation.

98
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:52,827
This is the perimeter of
â€œLas CaÃ±adasâ€â€¦ 306 hectares.

99
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,122
We're here; we had
180 heads of beef cattle...

100
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:01,378
...grazing, sort of rotating in very
large pastures, on the hills.

101
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,756
All work was done by hand:
land clearing, then the herbicides.

102
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,509
It all went to the cattle ranch.

103
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,386
We got the cows out...

104
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:14,974
...we planted 50,000 native
trees in this deforested area...

105
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,687
...and, by 2007, this is how
things looked like.

106
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,983
Later on, we can see
the transformation.

107
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,237
This is last December.

108
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,740
You can still see little
patches of star grass,

109
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,243
but now it's covered withâ€¦

110
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,203
The change is quite obvious.

111
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,706
This over here looks open now.

112
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,917
You couldn't see it before,
because it was all cow pastures,

113
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:45,380
and now it's 6 hectares of
corn, for all the members.

114
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,471
You told me you were gonna
live far away from home...

115
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:55,557
...very far away from home.

116
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,602
Away from home,
but in â€œLas CaÃ±adasâ€.

117
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:04,441
I would be like a
plant doctor orâ€¦

118
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,068
It's like a herb doctor
or something.

119
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,528
Like Concha?

120
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,239
Yeah, like Concha,
but a bit more

121
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,324
It's completely devoted to it.

122
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:17,537
And what were you
going to be in twenty?

123
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,831
Oh! I was also
going to be a writer.

124
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,375
- A writer?
- I was gonna write, in my free time.

125
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,087
What about you?

126
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,216
- No clue.
- Come on, Rafa!

127
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,252
Will you live in the
country or in the city?

128
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,263
I don't know.

129
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,891
Great prospects for the future.

130
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,976
If I join the army,
I'll be in the city.

131
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,936
- And if you don't?
- The army? Really?

132
00:17:41,937 --> 00:17:42,937
Yes

133
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,814
All boys want the army.

134
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,566
Makes them feel powerful.

135
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,318
Why powerful?

136
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,570
Because you have a gun,
or something.

137
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,742
I wanna be an army doctor,
not a hitman.

138
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,160
Oh! OK!

139
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,579
Being in the army doesn't
mean being a hitman?

140
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,206
Exactly.
I won't kill.

141
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,958
OK, good! You'd better!

142
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:39,971
In this document,
we find that 1% in Mexico...

143
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,057
...controls 21% of the income.

144
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:46,144
That's more than in the U.S.,
than in Colombia.

145
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:50,065
It's the highest ratio
in the entire world regarding

146
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:53,026
...the countries we have
information about.

147
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,111
There are not many,
but for all the countries...

148
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,529
...we had information about...

149
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:59,699
...it was the country with the
highest income concentration.

150
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:03,953
The problem we're looking
at with the INEGI

151
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,915
in this "incident",
as Enrique calls it...

152
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,409
- That's what he calls it,
- What would you call it?

153
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,087
I'd call it I'm less
elegant than Enrique.

154
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,505
I'd call it a mistake.

155
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,206
I'd like to think it's
an honest mistake

156
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,758
Well, worse things
come to minds.

157
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,386
Thank you, Ricardo, both
of you for being here.

158
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,305
So if I give away
â€œLas CaÃ±adasâ€, the land...

159
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:24,849
...and register it as a
nonprofit organization...

160
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,826
...if I donate it to a
nonprofit organization...

161
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:31,189
...where we're all members
in a co-op, it means you.

162
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,608
I don't get any land.

163
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:36,236
You don't get any land!
Exactly.

164
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,948
- What do you think of that?
- I think it's great becauseâ€¦

165
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:42,784
Think about it and
tell me straight. Seriously.

166
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,079
Seriously, seriously, seriously,
I think it's great.

167
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,498
I do want a little piece for me,
for my home...

168
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:54,421
...my vegetable garden and stuff,
but what would I do with all that land?

169
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,881
Besides, if you
have that, it's like.

170
00:20:57,507 --> 00:21:00,510
Well, the co-op members
wouldn't feel as safe

171
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:02,987
'cause they'd be building on
your land, so the day you go:

172
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:07,267
No more co-op", you'd be keeping
all those goods which area.

173
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:10,687
Yes, collective,
that belong to all of us.

174
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:15,483
And the idea that
everybody else would beâ€¦

175
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:16,943
Left out in the cold.

176
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,695
Right! I don't like that.

177
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,406
Besides, what would I
do with so much land?

178
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,366
Sell it and travel
around the world.

179
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:27,454
But, the money wouldn't
last forever, thatâ€™s no good.

180
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:30,415
Yeah, when it's gone, it's gone.

181
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,067
Oh!

182
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,614
Well, that's it, man,
I'm just waiting.

183
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:54,869
Yes, yes, I'll text you,
if anything happens.

184
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:59,582
Yes. Theoretically I'm due
this week, but, you know,

185
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:02,002
JonÃ¡s was two
weeks late, soâ€¦

186
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:07,007
Yes, Ani, I'm taking it easy, but you
know you can't take any medicine...

187
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:09,009
...when you're like this.

188
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:24,941
Here, take this one.

189
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,551
Yes, for your baby sister!

190
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:56,514
Shall I hold it, or does
it stay on its own?

191
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,058
It's anchored already.

192
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,643
It's clean. Stop.

193
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:03,188
Come here, let's
wash your hands.

194
00:26:03,405 --> 00:26:04,706
I don't remember how it goes.

195
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:05,932
Like this, I think, right?

196
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:09,319
You don't tighten it?
Or was it?

197
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,989
It's the other way around.

198
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,950
Truth is I don't remember, dear.

199
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,912
-No, no, no, hold on!
-This one's not for you.

200
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:23,500
I definitely need the
larger screw, but it's lost.

201
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,962
It should be in the bag,
but it's not.

202
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,925
That's weird, because
you put everything in there.

203
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:33,802
Oh, now you did it!

204
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,512
Give the baby a little kiss.

205
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,767
Wow!

206
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:42,852
Yes.

207
00:26:47,482 --> 00:26:49,234
Easy, easy, remember?

208
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:52,737
â€¦remember she's very tiny.

209
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:35,989
Hey.

210
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:37,949
Firewood wouldn't catch.

211
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:39,617
It wouldn't catch?

212
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:43,913
Time to eat.

213
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:47,500
- It's the friendly hour.
- Some cheese?

214
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,711
Have a taco.

215
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,679
Remember, Don AdÃ¡n,
the first time we met?

216
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,556
-Yeah.
-When we met?

217
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:02,766
Yeah.

218
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:06,019
It's been so nice.
We've been friends ever since.

219
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:09,105
How long has it been?

220
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,150
Like five years.

221
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:18,114
You were sowing corn over there.

222
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:21,409
I helped you plant
corn and beans.

223
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:24,913
I worked with you
for two weeks.

224
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:26,623
Then we went to
work in the barns.

225
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:28,708
Is it the one that has
stalks this thick?

226
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:35,131
They told me to use star
grass to fertilize my land.

227
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,593
Oh, and you took
it to Perote?

228
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:39,928
Yeah.

229
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:43,223
But I planted it
and watered it

230
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:45,809
and it died even faster.

231
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:47,560
Didnâ€™t help much.

232
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:49,104
No, it didnâ€™t help much.

233
00:28:50,188 --> 00:28:54,567
Well, Don AdÃ¡n, that was the
reason I stayed here with you.

234
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:55,985
Yes.

235
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:01,908
I asked if there was a chance
for me to work here with you.

236
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,457
And, I think yes, itâ€™s fine by me

237
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:13,753
and I feel good here.

238
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:44,868
EMERGENCY PREP ROOM

239
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,381
Thatâ€™s the heart.

240
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:01,551
-Is that where it hurts? Here?
-Yeah, it feels tight there.

241
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,721
That's where theâ€¦
in fact, that's where it starts.

242
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:06,264
Oh, right!

243
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:08,350
The contraction. See?

244
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,270
You already have a C-section,
and it could tear theâ€¦

245
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:15,440
â€¦the scar left by JonÃ¡s.

246
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:19,402
In a very long labor,
it could tearâ€¦

247
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,572
But if everything goes
normally, does itâ€¦?

248
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:25,867
-We're almost there, aren't we?
-One week, tops.

249
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:27,827
-No, we're going toâ€¦
-No?

250
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,872
So we're going to
wait until I'm in labor.

251
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:32,499
Yes, right?

252
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:36,544
If I come back on Thursday and Iâ€™m not,
heâ€™s gonna put me in the OR.

253
00:30:37,754 --> 00:30:40,256
Yeah, looks like it.

254
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:42,467
Yeah, he will.

255
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,010
Letâ€™s take it easy.

256
00:30:44,302 --> 00:30:45,637
-What?
-Letâ€™s take it easy.

257
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:51,309
It's illegal to perform a
C-section without your consent.

258
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:52,477
Yeah.

259
00:30:52,644 --> 00:30:55,021
-He can't force you to.
-I wanted to see the dates,

260
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:57,899
â€˜cause he didn't even check.

261
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:01,611
His memory's bad, but
I'm still on time.

262
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:02,821
Yes.

263
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:06,866
And I have water, I mean,
everythingâ€™s fine. Fine.

264
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:08,743
-Oh, that man.
-Relax, woman.

265
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:11,371
Don't get all worked up.
It's not good for you.

266
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,875
Easy for you to say.
It's not you under the knife.

267
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:09,346
Rufino, could you tell
them where to enter?

268
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:11,306
Go through the
furrows up ahead.

269
00:32:11,314 --> 00:32:12,599
Yes, but they
don't know how.

270
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:14,142
Ok, come on!

271
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:16,811
-Are you taking that spot?
-Yes.

272
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:24,277
-Take it easy, Karim
-What's wrong?

273
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:27,572
With your feet itâ€™s
like half a step.

274
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:30,867
Itâ€™s about to rain, soâ€¦

275
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:33,703
-Do you want to switch?
-No, it's too big.

276
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:35,997
Taxi, guess what!

277
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:38,625
They're releasing Allegiant,
but in two parts.

278
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:39,918
Like Twilight!

279
00:32:40,126 --> 00:32:43,088
That's what everybody
does with the last book.

280
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:45,256
Do you know who did it first?
Harry Potter.

281
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:49,678
I was reading yesterday
but I fell asleep.

282
00:32:49,686 --> 00:32:51,554
"-What part are you on?
-I don't remember."

283
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:53,056
Taxi!

284
00:32:53,815 --> 00:32:55,642
I remember only after
Iâ€™ve read it twice.

285
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,310
Has anything
happened with Caleb?

286
00:32:58,269 --> 00:32:59,938
Or how do you say it?
I say Caleb.

287
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:01,356
"-But you sayâ€¦
-Caleb. "

288
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:03,191
It gets intense.

289
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:04,651
That guy does something bad.

290
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:08,947
That's my favorite.

291
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:35,932
The cage is missing, man!

292
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,478
We'll unload a
couple of sacks here.

293
00:34:20,977 --> 00:34:22,187
Everyone against Diego!

294
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:23,813
Everyone against Diego!

295
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:28,109
-Karim, stop it!
-What?

296
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,778
You throw the biggest stones!

297
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:31,321
-I donâ€™t!
-Watch out!

298
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:39,329
SofÃ­a! Vargas Pellicer!

299
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:41,039
Sofi!

300
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:42,540
Come to eat!

301
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,835
Come here, GÃ¼era,
don't eat JosÃ©â€™s food!

302
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:47,796
Yeah, right? Itâ€™s Betoâ€™s.

303
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:54,260
Does it work?

304
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:56,262
I donâ€™t know.

305
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,141
Whereâ€™s Beto from?

306
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:01,226
From here.

307
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:02,519
I think so.

308
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:17,075
Itâ€™s no good! Youâ€™re done!
Like toast! Hurry!

309
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,869
Letâ€™s see!

310
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:23,456
Rafa, come here
if you want some.

311
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,126
Pumpkin.

312
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:35,218
It counts, it counts.

313
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:37,012
3-2

314
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:41,307
Thanks.

315
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:42,600
I almost fell down.

316
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:01,638
Baby!

317
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,662
There's no point. If you're
full term, thatâ€™s it.

318
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:53,291
You already have a C-section,
there's no point in waiting.

319
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,086
We wouldn't want
anything bad to happen.

320
00:38:56,419 --> 00:39:00,382
If you come in with an emergency,
then we run to the rescue, you know?

321
00:39:00,924 --> 00:39:02,133
But we all have to be there.

322
00:39:03,593 --> 00:39:05,679
-Today is the 28th?
-29th.

323
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:14,604
I don't know. What's the
right thing to do?

324
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:24,823
Oh, love, letâ€™s do it.

325
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:28,660
OR

326
00:39:28,743 --> 00:39:29,869
Where's mom?

327
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:33,164
I'll be right back. You stay
here with dad and MÃ³nica.

328
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:34,499
Just for a bit.

329
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:44,134
"-We have a pair now!
-Yes.

330
00:39:45,343 --> 00:39:46,344
Wow!"

331
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:49,389
The doctor's so quick, huh?

332
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,849
She needs warmth.

333
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:54,102
Want us to put something
here to hold her up?

334
00:39:54,352 --> 00:39:56,521
-Yeah, good idea.
-What do you want?

335
00:39:57,272 --> 00:39:59,024
Look at her.

336
00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:02,777
Oh! You want to see,
you want to see.

337
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:06,614
Look, baby, your
baby sister.

338
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:11,369
Does it hurt?
Does it?

339
00:40:11,536 --> 00:40:12,579
-What?
-The C-section?

340
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:13,788
Yesâ€¦ yes.

341
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:15,540
I can tell.

342
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:17,959
And sheâ€™s shivering
with cold.

343
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:21,796
Look at herâ€¦

344
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:23,131
She likes you.

345
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,425
Your little sister's nursing.

346
00:40:25,842 --> 00:40:27,469
Like the little goat, huh, baby?

347
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,764
Yeah, she's your little sister.

348
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:32,182
Let's go change your diaper.

349
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:40,959
Are you all here for the goats?

350
00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:43,378
Damn, there's a lot of us!

351
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:45,463
Well, let's start by putting

352
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:49,175
one liter of corn in
each bowl, as usual.

353
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:53,346
The bad thing is you don't
hear it here, Haya.

354
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,098
No, you don't hear it.

355
00:41:55,306 --> 00:41:56,933
You'll hear it as soon
as it gets full.

356
00:41:57,517 --> 00:41:58,601
I'm hearing it.

357
00:42:00,228 --> 00:42:02,105
Shut up, I'm just
getting started.

358
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:09,029
Bartolo does it better.

359
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:14,159
Hey! Stand still!

360
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:17,787
Don't squeeze her
so hard, ZacarÃ­as.

361
00:42:18,246 --> 00:42:20,749
-Let's see.
-Haya'll beat you.

362
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:24,502
See? She knows.

363
00:42:25,712 --> 00:42:27,797
No, Haya. I donâ€™t
hear anything.

364
00:42:28,798 --> 00:42:29,883
There it is!

365
00:42:30,216 --> 00:42:31,843
It was already full!

366
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:40,643
Looks like GÃ¼era is
pregnant too.

367
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:44,689
Look, this one lets
you do it. Kinda.

368
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,693
Kinda, you're right.

369
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:50,653
He has a tiny mouth.

370
00:42:52,405 --> 00:42:53,490
Puchus!

371
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:55,825
Let's go take him.

372
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:58,995
No, with this rope.
That one's too old; it'll snap.

373
00:43:00,705 --> 00:43:02,332
Here.
Tell ZacarÃ­as to lift you up.

374
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,292
-You want up?
-I'll do it.

375
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:14,177
-You push the goat.
-Move, move!

376
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:16,054
Look at that, he's walking.

377
00:43:17,138 --> 00:43:18,264
Go, Puchus!

378
00:43:21,518 --> 00:43:23,728
The goat is getting
used to Puchus, butâ€¦

379
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:30,068
As long as he doesn't
sway too much, it's fine.

380
00:43:56,678 --> 00:43:58,221
What is it, baby, what?

381
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,142
What's the matter, baby?

382
00:44:10,942 --> 00:44:12,902
You would've liked a
natural birth, right?

383
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:15,113
Of course, mom, from
the first pregnancy.

384
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:17,949
And the goat had two, right?

385
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:20,035
Two, like a breeze.

386
00:44:22,537 --> 00:44:24,748
She just pushed
and out they went.

387
00:44:35,258 --> 00:44:37,427
What is it you like the
most about the ranch?

388
00:44:40,513 --> 00:44:41,514
Well, mom, uhmâ€¦

389
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:42,724
â€¦Everything.

390
00:44:42,807 --> 00:44:43,892
Everything?

391
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:51,149
-There's so much to like, right?
-Thereâ€™s no need to drive.

392
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:53,193
-No need to what?
-There's no need to drive.

393
00:44:53,568 --> 00:44:55,070
Drive what?

394
00:44:55,862 --> 00:44:57,947
-A car.
-Come on, youâ€™re wrong on that one.

395
00:44:58,031 --> 00:44:59,032
The needâ€¦

396
00:44:59,115 --> 00:45:00,784
-No! I mean I like that!
-Huh?

397
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:01,993
I like that about this place.

398
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:04,287
Okay, fine, but you can't go
around with two kids,

399
00:45:04,537 --> 00:45:05,622
walkingâ€¦

400
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:08,333
It's a five-minute walk
to work, mom.

401
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:11,753
-Oh, well, hereâ€¦
-Well, you asked about the ranch.

402
00:45:11,961 --> 00:45:14,381
-Yes, right.
-Yeah.

403
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:19,094
And do you think your kids
have a good future here, Karla?

404
00:45:19,427 --> 00:45:21,179
-Of course, mom.
-You do?

405
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:23,807
-Of course.
-Why?

406
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:28,812
For starters, the love for
the land. That's important.

407
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:31,564
To love the land, and
to know how to work it.

408
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,183
Whether they want to do it or not
later on, that's another story.

409
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:37,237
But don't you think they
need schooling, a career?

410
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:40,115
That's not an issue.

411
00:45:40,123 --> 00:45:42,383
It doesn't have to be a formal
career for them toâ€¦

412
00:45:43,284 --> 00:45:45,495
â€¦for them to know things, right?

413
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:49,082
But, of course they need
school, mom.

414
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:53,169
But not the kind of schooling
there is now,

415
00:45:55,338 --> 00:45:57,424
where you're disconnected
from everything else

416
00:45:57,632 --> 00:45:59,718
and stuck in a classroom, right?

417
00:46:00,176 --> 00:46:02,470
But, do they learn?
You did.

418
00:46:03,555 --> 00:46:06,516
Yes, but I learned so much
more here, doing thingsâ€¦

419
00:46:06,725 --> 00:46:10,353
-â€¦than in school.
-Of course.

420
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:13,314
Every mom here,
myself included,

421
00:46:13,732 --> 00:46:17,235
wants their children to
know things and learn.

422
00:46:19,112 --> 00:46:21,531
What's the difference
between your family and his?

423
00:46:22,824 --> 00:46:24,159
They all live there.

424
00:46:24,576 --> 00:46:26,536
Just that?
That his family lives together?

425
00:46:26,995 --> 00:46:30,290
I mean, the mom lives with
her children, right? Sort of.

426
00:46:31,249 --> 00:46:33,209
-Would you like that?
-I would!

427
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,837
You didn't live with me,
though, for a long time.

428
00:46:36,087 --> 00:46:37,589
That's why I'm telling you,

429
00:46:37,797 --> 00:46:39,674
I didn't appreciate
that until I came here.

430
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:40,717
Oh!

431
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,303
That's why I invited you
to move here, right?

432
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:52,187
It's the kind of thingâ€¦
we want to instill in our children.

433
00:46:56,566 --> 00:46:57,650
Sure, there's no guarantee.

434
00:46:57,859 --> 00:46:59,277
Maybe they'll leave anyway.

435
00:47:00,904 --> 00:47:03,656
The only thing she
wanted was to move here.

436
00:47:03,865 --> 00:47:05,742
She got her certification,

437
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:08,703
and as soon as she did,
she said: "Mom, I'm leaving".

438
00:47:09,579 --> 00:47:11,206
It made me sad, butâ€¦

439
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:16,336
She left everything
she'd learned behind,

440
00:47:16,586 --> 00:47:18,004
everything she'd accomplished,

441
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:22,050
to start over,
because she wanted this.

442
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:25,345
I didnâ€™t expect that.

443
00:47:26,888 --> 00:47:28,848
But when I saw
how happy she was,

444
00:47:29,265 --> 00:47:31,893
I was glad she came.

445
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:35,855
Because we all have
to be happy, right?

446
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:38,024
Allow our children

447
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:42,320
to find happiness.

448
00:47:45,615 --> 00:47:48,451
I was concerned about
the way she lived and all,

449
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,248
because she was used to
another, a differentâ€¦

450
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:55,458
â€¦a different life, right?

451
00:47:56,001 --> 00:47:58,169
But, when I saw how happy she was,

452
00:47:58,962 --> 00:48:00,255
I accepted it.

453
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,886
I slept like two hours.

454
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,555
Three and a half,
more or less.

455
00:48:08,763 --> 00:48:11,391
Hey, don't make fun, OK?

456
00:48:13,693 --> 00:48:15,662
I thought youâ€™d already
done something else,

457
00:48:15,895 --> 00:48:18,064
being the principal's
daughterâ€™s birthday and allâ€¦

458
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,528
Good morning, Don Goyo!

459
00:48:24,529 --> 00:48:26,281
-Don Goyo!
-Good morning, kids.

460
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,666
I don't know if
you've visited the cities,

461
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:39,753
but there's a lot of
construction going on there.

462
00:48:40,003 --> 00:48:43,923
That causes an impact on forests,
and you also need

463
00:48:44,466 --> 00:48:46,968
material to build houses.

464
00:48:46,977 --> 00:48:48,536
And where does this
material come from?

465
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,363
-The forests.
-If they need wood, from trees,

466
00:48:50,388 --> 00:48:54,768
and if they need other minerals
or material, they clear them.

467
00:48:55,185 --> 00:48:57,145
We're losing our forests,
what else?

468
00:48:57,479 --> 00:49:01,191
-Fragmentation.
-What is that? Remember?

469
00:49:01,524 --> 00:49:05,153
It's a kind of isolation.
Like Taxi says,

470
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:07,906
they build houses and
leave a forest on one side,

471
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:09,949
then houses, and a
forest on the other.

472
00:49:10,408 --> 00:49:11,409
They're separated.

473
00:49:11,826 --> 00:49:14,245
-They split it into pieces.
-And I guess animals,

474
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:17,624
if they don't have enough
room or space to live in,

475
00:49:17,707 --> 00:49:21,711
they can't go elsewhere, because
there are houses, roads and stuff.

476
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:23,755
Jocelyn?

477
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,258
-There are severalâ€¦
-Things.

478
00:49:27,592 --> 00:49:29,678
Yeah, there's also
climate change, right?

479
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:33,723
With so many natural events,

480
00:49:34,265 --> 00:49:35,600
they're being destroyed.

481
00:49:37,227 --> 00:49:40,522
All right, what do you
recall about cloud forests?

482
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,567
-Cloud forests? Wellâ€¦
-What caught your attention? Diego.

483
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,738
They donâ€™tâ€¦ How do you say?
Tree felling is not allowed.

484
00:49:49,197 --> 00:49:51,574
Tree felling is not fully allowed.

485
00:49:51,825 --> 00:49:55,412
What I found interesting is
that supposedly there are

486
00:49:55,662 --> 00:49:59,499
very few cloud
forests in Mexico.

487
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:01,668
There are cloud forests
in very few areas.

488
00:50:01,876 --> 00:50:03,837
They are nearly nonexistent
in the world actually.

489
00:50:04,295 --> 00:50:08,341
So, what does all this information
make you think about?

490
00:50:09,217 --> 00:50:11,636
We're talking
about our home,

491
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:15,890
the region of Huatusco, Coscomatepec,
all around Xalapa,

492
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:21,896
one of the few places where there
are still cloud forests in Mexico,

493
00:50:22,313 --> 00:50:23,857
where there's biodiversity and

494
00:50:24,065 --> 00:50:25,734
where we can still
find Quercus insignis.

495
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:27,127
So, what do you
think about that?

496
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:29,779
I think the world is going
to end because of this.

497
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:31,072
Oh!

498
00:50:32,574 --> 00:50:34,117
But I don't know what to do.

499
00:50:34,325 --> 00:50:36,286
Well, I can do something
to make it better,

500
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:38,705
but I don't think it'll
work if it's just me.

501
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:40,373
What can we do so
we won't feel likeâ€¦

502
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:43,752
â€¦frustrated, helpless?

503
00:50:44,544 --> 00:50:45,837
Some kind of campaign?

504
00:50:46,629 --> 00:50:51,009
Because rich people
pay to cut down trees,

505
00:50:51,217 --> 00:50:52,761
to do things like that.

506
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:55,263
We all contribute in
some way or another.

507
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:58,433
-To the felling, I mean.
-We canâ€¦

508
00:50:58,667 --> 00:51:00,535
Felling and climate change,
and everything.

509
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:01,853
How can we not contribute?

510
00:51:02,062 --> 00:51:05,023
We need to do something to
prevent this from happening.

511
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:07,650
The question is:
can we do something?

512
00:51:07,984 --> 00:51:09,069
Yes.

513
00:51:10,236 --> 00:51:11,905
"-Stop consuming, I meanâ€¦
-Stop buying."

514
00:51:12,113 --> 00:51:17,160
â€¦not exaggerating with what we buy,
because sometimes we depend on it.

515
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,072
Like ToÃ±o says,

516
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:22,415
maybe a campaign

517
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:26,252
where we teach or show
people the importance ofâ€¦

518
00:51:26,378 --> 00:51:29,172
-A course.
-â€¦of protecting the forest.

519
00:51:29,964 --> 00:51:33,051
We can't save the
forests of the world,

520
00:51:33,134 --> 00:51:37,514
but we can have an impact
on the place where we live.

521
00:51:57,534 --> 00:51:58,827
Where to?

522
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:01,246
Where are you going?

523
00:52:01,454 --> 00:52:03,123
Son of yourâ€¦
grandmother!

524
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:05,834
Are you done?
You want to go already?

525
00:52:48,668 --> 00:52:50,879
Let's go to class.
Let's go see the children.

526
00:52:51,963 --> 00:52:54,799
So you can see Haya and Tania.

527
00:52:55,925 --> 00:52:57,010
-Karla?
-Yeah.

528
00:52:58,094 --> 00:53:00,680
Come here, you.
I didnâ€™t catch you yesterday.

529
00:53:00,847 --> 00:53:03,099
They already have theirâ€¦

530
00:53:06,061 --> 00:53:08,146
-â€¦They already have their book.?
-Great.

531
00:53:08,813 --> 00:53:11,316
-May I erase this?
-Yes!

532
00:53:13,193 --> 00:53:16,162
"-We started to miss you, Karla.
-Whoâ€™s teaching you chemistry, Tania?"

533
00:53:16,196 --> 00:53:17,614
I missed you, too.

534
00:53:18,948 --> 00:53:22,452
Let's talk about vegetable
garden planning.

535
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,761
We're going to do another one?

536
00:53:23,995 --> 00:53:27,374
No. We're going to make
a plan of what weâ€™ll plant.

537
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:30,001
-Right.
-The first exercise is

538
00:53:30,543 --> 00:53:34,172
to organize a bed, and see what
we will plant throughout the year.

539
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:38,635
The next step is for
third-graders to be able to

540
00:53:39,177 --> 00:53:43,682
plan the six beds they have,

541
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,851
so that first- and second-graders
can help their classmates out.

542
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,729
That's the goal: to plan
throughout the year

543
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:51,564
what you'll grow in your beds.

544
00:53:52,148 --> 00:53:54,109
"-Jicama!
-Jicama, in hot weather. "

545
00:53:54,984 --> 00:53:56,069
That one, down here.

546
00:53:57,278 --> 00:54:00,115
African cucumbers that
are planted in May.

547
00:54:00,657 --> 00:54:02,200
That one here,
under humidity.

548
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:04,703
Look, kids, let me
tell you a bit about

549
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:07,664
how we learned about
vegetables here.

550
00:54:08,331 --> 00:54:11,042
Since we only knew the
ones weâ€™ve already mentioned,

551
00:54:11,209 --> 00:54:13,920
we stopped planting
during the rainy season

552
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:15,338
because nothing thrived.

553
00:54:15,672 --> 00:54:19,509
We planted carrots, beets,
cabbages; but they rotted.

554
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:22,095
-Every single year, untilâ€¦
-Did they wilt?

555
00:54:22,345 --> 00:54:23,763
Exactly, they wilted.

556
00:54:24,097 --> 00:54:27,809
In our garden here,
we almost got no broccoli.

557
00:54:28,143 --> 00:54:29,144
Very little.

558
00:54:30,695 --> 00:54:33,289
Also last year, I think, they
planted in â€œLas CaÃ±adasâ€â€¦

559
00:54:33,398 --> 00:54:36,818
-â€¦ but there was ground frost, soâ€¦
-That was two years ago.

560
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,779
-No. Last year, right?
-No, the frost was two years ago.

561
00:54:39,946 --> 00:54:40,947
Two years.

562
00:54:40,989 --> 00:54:44,242
-Well, the frost killed everything.
-All the plants died.

563
00:54:47,203 --> 00:54:50,707
I've been here and itâ€™s
really cold in March.

564
00:54:54,294 --> 00:54:56,171
D'you know how the
mermaid myth was born?

565
00:54:56,379 --> 00:54:59,466
Men were too long at sea
and didn't see any women.

566
00:54:59,674 --> 00:55:02,719
So when they saw a manatee,
they were so desperate to see women

567
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:05,263
that they actually thought
manatees were women.

568
00:55:05,272 --> 00:55:06,806
That's how mermaids were invented.

569
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:08,975
I think. Just don't
ask me where I read it.

570
00:55:09,184 --> 00:55:11,478
-So when you spend a long timeâ€¦
-Wikipedia?

571
00:55:11,811 --> 00:55:15,106
No! When you spend a
long time with a womanâ€¦

572
00:55:15,115 --> 00:55:18,117
Well, in this case, if you're a man
and you spend a long time with a woman,

573
00:55:18,151 --> 00:55:22,113
even if she's plain, at a certain
point you'll think she's a mermaid.

574
00:55:22,572 --> 00:55:24,407
Even if you have a
girlfriend, I swear.

575
00:55:24,516 --> 00:55:26,176
And why are you in a
group from Venezuela?

576
00:55:26,284 --> 00:55:28,912
It's not from Venezuela.
The group is fromâ€¦

577
00:55:29,662 --> 00:55:31,748
Oh! From a webpage where
you read stories.

578
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:33,375
Called Wattpad.

579
00:55:34,668 --> 00:55:35,877
By the way.

580
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:40,382
So, this guy got into the group,

581
00:55:40,715 --> 00:55:43,134
and asked me who Ameca was,
the one who said he was cute.

582
00:55:43,468 --> 00:55:44,761
And I was like:

583
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:46,846
"What did you just say, man?"

584
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:47,806
And thenâ€¦

585
00:55:47,889 --> 00:55:51,101
Well, other things happened,
and I said: "Oh, that guy".

586
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:54,604
So we started getting along,
we started talking.

587
00:55:54,854 --> 00:55:58,233
Then he texted me privately,
in a private chat,

588
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:00,193
and we became friends.

589
00:56:01,736 --> 00:56:03,279
-Friends, just friends.
-Yeah.

590
00:56:03,488 --> 00:56:05,031
-What?
-Tell me one reason

591
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,617
why a long distance
romance is a good thing.

592
00:56:08,535 --> 00:56:11,454
Because when two people love
each other, it shouldn't matter.

593
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:13,456
-That's not a good reason.
-It is!

594
00:56:13,581 --> 00:56:16,418
-No!
-I think long-distance love works.

595
00:56:18,628 --> 00:56:21,006
No! It's like putting
yourself to the test.

596
00:56:21,464 --> 00:56:23,633
Get it? If you really
love someone,

597
00:56:23,683 --> 00:56:25,735
even if they're far away,
you don't cheat on them.

598
00:56:26,052 --> 00:56:32,058
Why do you say 'cheat'? We're just
14, 16, 15-year-old pubescent kids.

599
00:56:32,859 --> 00:56:34,244
Okay, if he kisses another girl.

600
00:56:35,895 --> 00:56:38,314
-Pubescent kidsâ€¦
-If he dates someone else.

601
00:56:38,648 --> 00:56:43,236
I used to be obsessed with
medicine, veterinary medicine.

602
00:56:44,738 --> 00:56:46,406
I'm not sure, butâ€¦

603
00:56:46,865 --> 00:56:50,243
I think I'll go
into psychology.

604
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:51,661
Cool!

605
00:56:51,745 --> 00:56:54,414
â€˜Cause, I don't know. I'm very
interested in it.

606
00:56:54,956 --> 00:56:58,668
Although people tell me to go for
a career that has more demand.

607
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:00,754
That psychology doesn't
have much demand.

608
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:03,048
But I refuse to listen.

609
00:57:04,257 --> 00:57:05,675
Are you going to
finish high school?

610
00:57:05,884 --> 00:57:07,177
Here? I'd like to.

611
00:57:07,427 --> 00:57:09,262
I'd like to stay,
and I'm going to,

612
00:57:09,512 --> 00:57:12,015
but my aunts and uncles are
always on my case saying:

613
00:57:12,023 --> 00:57:14,434
"Go someplace else.
You've been there for six yearsâ€¦â€

614
00:57:14,442 --> 00:57:16,052
-â€˜Cause youâ€™re a bad influence.
-Hold on,

615
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:17,987
her aunt said she didn't
have any friends.

616
00:57:18,396 --> 00:57:19,397
-What?
-My aunt said:

617
00:57:19,522 --> 00:57:21,983
"Go study someplace else;
you don't have any friends there"

618
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,238
-She must love you.
-I am nothing.

619
00:57:28,323 --> 00:57:29,657
How depressing.

620
00:57:29,866 --> 00:57:34,037
And I'm going to live at
the Casa del Campesino.

621
00:57:34,245 --> 00:57:37,207
-With me?
-Yes, we're gonna live together.

622
00:57:38,667 --> 00:57:40,502
You're not in the club. Sorry, Rafa.

623
00:57:42,253 --> 00:57:44,130
I wanna finish high school first.

624
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:46,091
-To begin with.
-To begin with,

625
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:50,136
I need to pass the semester.
Believe me.

626
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:53,314
With all the things that
happened to me this semesterâ€¦

627
00:57:53,848 --> 00:57:54,849
Why?

628
00:57:55,183 --> 00:57:56,393
I have five reports.

629
00:57:56,601 --> 00:57:58,144
-Why?
-Rafa!

630
00:57:58,395 --> 00:58:03,191
At â€œLas CaÃ±adasâ€, you were
really smart and got straight Aâ€™s.

631
00:58:03,441 --> 00:58:05,610
-What happened to you?
-The party life.

632
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:07,153
-What?
-Nothing.

633
00:58:07,178 --> 00:58:08,780
Do you still want to
become an army doctor?

634
00:58:08,863 --> 00:58:10,865
Yes, I want to
go into medicine.

635
00:58:11,282 --> 00:58:13,827
You've wanted to
ever since we were kids.

636
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:17,038
I'm hungry.

637
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:19,541
-You're hungry, Rafa?
-We just had lunch.

638
00:58:19,749 --> 00:58:21,626
-Didnâ€™t you eat anything?
-A bit.

639
00:58:21,751 --> 00:58:22,836
"I just had two
tamalesâ€¦"

640
00:58:23,086 --> 00:58:24,921
He went to sit with
Oscar instead of us.

641
00:58:25,055 --> 00:58:26,798
With Oscarâ€¦
I forgot he was down there.

642
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:29,092
I was on my own.
You were the ones who left.

643
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:33,013
No! We didnâ€™t leave, you left, and
we went after you and we thoughtâ€¦

644
00:58:33,263 --> 00:58:34,681
-Is that so?
-Yes, itâ€™s true!

645
00:58:34,889 --> 00:58:35,890
You didn't say anything.

646
00:58:36,307 --> 00:58:38,184
There was no need for words, Rafa.

647
00:59:10,675 --> 00:59:14,721
But the issue nobody talks about

648
00:59:14,846 --> 00:59:16,139
is that of the land.

649
00:59:17,474 --> 00:59:21,728
Have you always thought
about the entire land?

650
00:59:24,147 --> 00:59:26,900
That's not the issue.
That's how most things are.

651
00:59:27,108 --> 00:59:31,571
It's the least to put aside
a lot for Haya, but after Haya

652
00:59:31,621 --> 00:59:33,773
you don't think about your
grandchildren or their children.

653
00:59:33,782 --> 00:59:35,742
So you can go on forever saying:

654
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:37,744
"I'm not giving anything anymore!"

655
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:41,873
But, we need to start a process
with the next generation as well,

656
00:59:42,123 --> 00:59:46,044
to make them feel theyâ€™re part
of the project, a part of the land.

657
00:59:46,052 --> 00:59:48,121
Well, if you're working here,
if you have no other options,

658
00:59:48,129 --> 00:59:49,964
if your ancestors
are buried hereâ€¦

659
00:59:50,423 --> 00:59:54,135
You have this space to design and
build your home, or you haveâ€¦?

660
00:59:55,136 --> 00:59:57,097
-Get it?
-Oh, I don't know.

661
00:59:57,347 --> 01:00:00,058
But if she doesn't have
something that's her own,

662
01:00:00,266 --> 01:00:01,476
and later onâ€¦

663
01:00:02,602 --> 01:00:07,732
there's a conflict with the co-op,
or something happens, I meanâ€¦

664
01:00:08,483 --> 01:00:10,643
Iâ€™m telling you.
That's the least of her worries.

665
01:00:10,694 --> 01:00:13,947
If she has 2, 3 hectares
of her own, that's it.

666
01:00:14,864 --> 01:00:18,576
If there's any conflict, you have your
space on the land where you were born.

667
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:20,120
Thatâ€™s more than enough.

668
01:00:20,328 --> 01:00:22,288
No problem.
We just do it. Period.

669
01:00:26,126 --> 01:00:27,961
Fine, but that doesn't solve theâ€¦

670
01:00:29,629 --> 01:00:31,381
Yeah, but it's just a possibility.

671
01:00:32,590 --> 01:00:35,969
You just solve the problem
for the next generation.

672
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:37,512
And the one after thatâ€¦

673
01:00:38,596 --> 01:00:42,308
-Goes back to square one.
-No, adjustments have to be made.

674
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:43,727
That's what this is about.

675
01:00:44,394 --> 01:00:49,107
How do we get the other
generations to work for the group?

676
01:00:49,649 --> 01:00:52,402
Like in the
Longo MaÃ¯ co-ops.

677
01:00:54,237 --> 01:00:55,780
If someone's not
happy, wellâ€¦

678
01:00:57,323 --> 01:00:58,742
there's the door.

679
01:01:00,285 --> 01:01:01,703
Half the children go,
half stay.

680
01:01:03,455 --> 01:01:04,456
Right.

681
01:01:05,665 --> 01:01:08,626
We need more children.
Are you up for it?

682
01:01:09,044 --> 01:01:10,045
No.

683
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:24,142
Wow. The funny thing is you
never know what will happen.

684
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:26,644
-It's likeâ€¦
-Yes, but you do know

685
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:30,357
what will happen
if you don't do it.

686
01:01:36,488 --> 01:01:39,240
-Your grandchildren will sell.
-Of course!

687
01:01:41,659 --> 01:01:43,620
-So now you know.
-I don't think Haya will.

688
01:01:44,287 --> 01:01:45,497
I don't know that.

689
01:01:53,254 --> 01:01:54,673
So now you know.

690
01:01:57,634 --> 01:02:01,721
If I'm conscious when I'm dying,
that will be my last thought.

691
01:02:04,516 --> 01:02:06,726
â€œMaybe Tania will
decide to travelâ€¦?â€

692
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:08,895
â€œWill she auction
the whole thing?â€

693
01:02:10,355 --> 01:02:11,981
Would be okay,
right, Richi?

694
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:15,026
No, I'd come back to
haunt you. At night.

695
01:02:47,767 --> 01:02:49,060
It's late, Mary.

696
01:02:49,978 --> 01:02:51,604
Yeah, it's getting late.

697
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,628
Last time we had to
give the hens some weeds,

698
01:03:58,254 --> 01:04:01,091
and someone told Julia
to give them flemingia,

699
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:02,967
and there she goes.

700
01:04:03,343 --> 01:04:04,427
She got tons of it!

701
01:04:04,636 --> 01:04:05,720
No kidding, Richi.

702
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:07,931
I think she took
all you had,

703
01:04:08,139 --> 01:04:09,891
and she laid it
out for the hens.

704
01:04:10,058 --> 01:04:12,936
When I got there, I asked Mauro:
"What is this?"

705
01:04:13,395 --> 01:04:16,356
And he said: "Dunno.
I told Julia the hens wouldn't eat it,

706
01:04:16,523 --> 01:04:18,233
but she gave it to
them anyway."

707
01:04:18,441 --> 01:04:20,402
-When mom arrivedâ€¦
-They didn't eat it.

708
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:21,820
Obviously not.

709
01:04:22,153 --> 01:04:23,855
But mom gave us all
a piece of her mind.

710
01:04:23,905 --> 01:04:24,989
Get the gate.

711
01:04:31,913 --> 01:04:35,083
-Well, it was like a test.
-But they don't look alike.

712
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:37,293
Well, I don't think so.

713
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:49,839
You think we can get
something out of there?

714
01:04:49,848 --> 01:04:51,141
Yeah.

715
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:04,279
What I still haven't read is why
it can be done in lemon water.

716
01:05:07,824 --> 01:05:10,660
One day we'll have avocados.

717
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:15,999
There's a tree at school, butâ€¦

718
01:05:16,791 --> 01:05:18,001
It's a Hass.

719
01:05:18,752 --> 01:05:21,921
-That poor tree in the shade?
-Yeah, we always put urine

720
01:05:23,131 --> 01:05:27,385
from the dry toilets, butâ€¦
it doesn't work much.

721
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:30,321
These trees need more
than just nitrogen.

722
01:05:46,571 --> 01:05:48,114
All right, let's go.

723
01:05:48,782 --> 01:05:50,950
Let's go that way.

724
01:05:52,702 --> 01:05:54,037
Are we getting chaya?

725
01:05:54,579 --> 01:05:58,541
This yam is ready.
See its leaves up there?

726
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:01,586
Yeah, is it that one?
Or that one?

727
01:06:06,758 --> 01:06:07,967
Shall we take a look?

728
01:06:08,927 --> 01:06:10,011
Just with your hand.

729
01:06:18,937 --> 01:06:20,063
Look.

730
01:06:20,897 --> 01:06:22,691
-See that?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

731
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:26,945
"-Take it out.
-Wait."

732
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:35,370
Yam, manioc, taro and,
in the end, air potatoes.

733
01:06:36,871 --> 01:06:38,748
Manioc goes on
top of the taro?

734
01:06:38,815 --> 01:06:40,475
Manioc on top of the taro,
that's right.

735
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:41,584
You're kidding.

736
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:45,213
Excuse me.

737
01:07:08,987 --> 01:07:09,988
Look, there're othersâ€¦

738
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,322
This little guy.

739
01:07:11,531 --> 01:07:13,199
-Careful.
-Here.

740
01:07:14,492 --> 01:07:16,494
Let me cut it for you. Hold on.

741
01:07:20,415 --> 01:07:22,834
-It's really big.
-Yeah.

742
01:07:29,549 --> 01:07:30,842
See how much
we got out now?

743
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:33,261
How much of that taro root do
you think is edible?

744
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:35,138
Wellâ€¦

745
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,223
-But it tastes better.
-Look, each one of theseâ€¦

746
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:41,353
Well, Hayaâ€¦

747
01:07:42,645 --> 01:07:44,064
We need leaves.

748
01:07:46,274 --> 01:07:47,901
I think it's eight already.

749
01:08:21,059 --> 01:08:23,436
Did you finally
manage to sew yourâ€¦?

750
01:08:23,895 --> 01:08:25,522
Yeah, I managed.

751
01:08:26,523 --> 01:08:28,400
I hope the teacher
says theyâ€™re all right.

752
01:09:43,975 --> 01:09:45,310
Good technique.

753
01:09:46,186 --> 01:09:48,480
It's a technique,
but it's alsoâ€¦

754
01:09:49,773 --> 01:09:52,192
-Skill?
-No. Practice, man.

755
01:09:53,193 --> 01:09:56,154
I was Puchusâ€™s age when
my dad took me to the harvest.

756
01:09:59,866 --> 01:10:01,701
A bit older, when I
was like five.

757
01:10:15,507 --> 01:10:17,050
Look at those
beauties, QuerubÃ­n!

758
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:30,188
The sowing season feast.

759
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:33,024
We'll be busy.

760
01:10:33,942 --> 01:10:36,111
We kill lambs on the 14th.

761
01:10:36,695 --> 01:10:39,447
Then we skin them
and cut them up.

762
01:10:39,656 --> 01:10:41,074
-You do that?
-Yeah.

763
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:44,369
Olegario too.
Olegario loves to kill.

764
01:10:44,994 --> 01:10:47,414
I just tell him where,
and he does the dirty work.

765
01:10:48,623 --> 01:10:50,375
"-Right, Romero?
-What?"

766
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,460
Like twenty lambs for
the feast of the corn.

767
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:29,761
Excuse meâ€¦

768
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:34,974
Move over!

769
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:49,656
Look, tie them like this
with one end, that end.

770
01:14:49,906 --> 01:14:52,409
"-Together?
-Yes, all together there,"

771
01:14:52,617 --> 01:14:54,577
so they wonâ€™t move around.

772
01:14:56,329 --> 01:14:57,747
How do you mean?
Like this?

773
01:14:57,872 --> 01:14:59,290
Yeah, like that.
Thatâ€™s it.

774
01:15:39,247 --> 01:15:41,458
We can pour it
in the big pot.

775
01:15:42,125 --> 01:15:44,961
-What?
-The blood into the bins, right?

776
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:49,341
There's the green knife.

777
01:15:53,136 --> 01:15:55,096
They sell them
at the flea market.

778
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:03,229
There you go.

779
01:16:11,488 --> 01:16:13,365
-We're becoming experts.
-Yeah.

780
01:16:13,573 --> 01:16:15,450
Iâ€™m gonna get into the
sheep business now.

781
01:16:15,784 --> 01:16:18,495
CÃ¡ntaro, don't pull
too much. There you go.

782
01:16:18,828 --> 01:16:20,914
Otherwise, the blood
wonâ€™t come out.

783
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:24,334
Didn't even kick,
nothing.

784
01:16:25,293 --> 01:16:26,961
If you pity it, it won't die.

785
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:28,046
You're right.

786
01:16:28,797 --> 01:16:32,217
Its lifeâ€™s passing
before its eyes.

787
01:16:32,842 --> 01:16:34,177
That's why it won't die.

788
01:16:36,346 --> 01:16:37,347
Itâ€™s strong!

789
01:16:37,389 --> 01:16:39,683
-Itâ€™s quite some blood, huh?
-Yeah! Lots of blood.

790
01:16:39,808 --> 01:16:40,892
It wonâ€™t die!

791
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,729
Someone's pitying it.
Gonzalito!

792
01:16:45,313 --> 01:16:47,065
You're pitying it,
aren't you?

793
01:16:47,357 --> 01:16:49,442
"-It refuses to die!
-Really?"

794
01:16:49,984 --> 01:16:52,737
"-You didnâ€™t hit the jugular.
-How many times did you stab it?"

795
01:16:52,862 --> 01:16:54,489
It won't die.

796
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:56,449
There's no more blood.

797
01:16:56,658 --> 01:16:58,326
There, thatâ€™s it.

798
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:05,000
"-You nailed it. Bled really well.
-Look how much blood!"

799
01:17:06,167 --> 01:17:07,168
Itâ€™s dead now.

800
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,045
No, but it's dying.

801
01:17:13,174 --> 01:17:14,384
Let's string it up.

802
01:17:15,051 --> 01:17:16,469
"-This one's mine.
-This one?"

803
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,888
Yeah, that oneâ€™s mine.
That one. Where?

804
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:40,535
Hello?

805
01:17:40,785 --> 01:17:42,662
Hi, sweetheart,
how are you?

806
01:17:42,746 --> 01:17:44,622
We've been well.

807
01:17:44,914 --> 01:17:46,458
How's daddy?

808
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:49,419
Fine, my dear, he's fine.
He already left for work.

809
01:17:49,669 --> 01:17:52,047
He'll be back in a
while, and then

810
01:17:52,172 --> 01:17:54,799
we'll go up to the dining hall.

811
01:17:55,759 --> 01:17:56,760
Great!

812
01:17:57,510 --> 01:17:58,720
-Yeah.
-All right.

813
01:17:59,412 --> 01:18:01,214
-Yes, it's gonna be nice.
-I'm glad, mommy.

814
01:18:01,473 --> 01:18:03,016
And how have you been?

815
01:18:03,224 --> 01:18:06,936
We've been all right, dear.
I went up to Los Altos.

816
01:18:07,145 --> 01:18:08,938
Saw your brothers.

817
01:18:10,231 --> 01:18:12,984
-Oh, good. How are they?
-They're all fine.

818
01:18:13,193 --> 01:18:15,362
When are you coming
for a visit, to see us?

819
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:21,076
Let me see if I can get
a few days off work.

820
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:27,957
All right, dear. Let's hope
you do. We miss you, honey.

821
01:18:29,042 --> 01:18:32,003
Me too, mom.
I miss you a lot, too.

822
01:18:51,272 --> 01:18:52,816
JosÃ© AdÃ¡n LÃ³pez Colorado.

823
01:18:59,406 --> 01:19:01,282
Eduardo Antonio Peralta Canseco.

824
01:19:10,959 --> 01:19:12,460
Haya Romero de Alba.

825
01:19:21,011 --> 01:19:22,429
Alonso SÃ¡nchez TepatlÃ¡n.

826
01:19:33,231 --> 01:19:35,400
JosÃ© Vargas Pellicer.

827
01:19:43,575 --> 01:19:45,326
ZacarÃ­as Villafuerte Colorado.

828
01:19:50,957 --> 01:19:52,584
Congratulations to all ourâ€¦

829
01:19:53,251 --> 01:19:54,919
â€¦all our graduates.

830
01:20:00,717 --> 01:20:04,763
I chose this phrase because
I think it describes us.

831
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:06,806
It says:
"Maybe small peopleâ€¦"

832
01:20:08,058 --> 01:20:09,267
Thank you.

833
01:20:12,312 --> 01:20:15,065
"Maybe small people
in small places

834
01:20:15,482 --> 01:20:17,025
doing small things

835
01:20:17,692 --> 01:20:19,110
can change the world."

836
01:20:20,111 --> 01:20:22,405
That's who I think we are.

837
01:20:22,489 --> 01:20:26,993
We're small people doing
things that might seem small,

838
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:29,496
but we can turn things around.

839
01:20:29,746 --> 01:20:33,124
I'm very proud, and I
feel very grateful to you.

840
01:20:34,793 --> 01:20:38,588
I love each one of
you in a special way.

841
01:20:38,797 --> 01:20:40,215
After everything we've shared,

842
01:20:40,799 --> 01:20:43,301
I feel I grew younger
over these three years,

843
01:20:43,968 --> 01:20:47,013
in spite of the scolds.

844
01:20:47,347 --> 01:20:51,726
I feel younger, more alive,
happy to have shared with you.

845
01:20:52,185 --> 01:20:54,688
Most of all,
I want you to be free.

846
01:20:54,896 --> 01:20:56,773
Don't sell yourself out,
don't give up.

847
01:20:56,981 --> 01:21:00,610
Just do that which makes
you truly happy. I love you.

848
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:35,186
On behalf of the co-op,
