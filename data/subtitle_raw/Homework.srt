1
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,219
Excuse me, Sir, what film is this?

2
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,618
<i>It's a film about homework...
homework assignment.</i>

3
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:08,179
<i>What school do you go to?</i>

4
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,459
Shahid Massoumi.

5
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:15,079
Have you done your homework?
- Yes.

6
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,299
Sure?
- Sure.

7
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,219
<i>Good. Go to school now,
we're coming too.</i>

8
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,839
<i>Excuse me, Sir...
sorry to bother you.</i>

9
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,079
<i>Can I help you?</i>

10
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,779
Sir, take our picture!

11
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,099
<i>Is that a children's movie, Sir?</i>

12
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,539
<i>Mr. Safavi, take a picture
of these children.</i>

13
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,979
<i>Excuse me, is it a feature film?</i>

14
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,699
<i>No, it's a documentary, I guess.</i>

15
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,859
<i>You can't tell until the film's made.</i>

16
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,499
<i>Excuse us, we have to start shooting.</i>

17
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,779
Excuse me, Sir, what is this film?

18
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,339
<i>It's about homework.
What school do you go to?</i>

19
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,819
Shahid Massoumi.

20
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,039
<i>It's about homework...
Have you done yours?</i>

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,418
Yes.

22
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,379
My homework's better than theirs.

23
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,219
<i>Off you go to school then.</i>

24
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,059
Goodbye, Sir.
- Salaam.

25
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,719
<i>Excuse me, Sir.</i>

26
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,479
<i>I'm interested in films and I'm
familiar with your work, Mr. Kiarostami.</i>

27
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,679
<i>Thank you.</i>

28
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,159
<i>I've seen one of your films too,
on TV.</i>

29
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,679
<i>it was filmed at school... in class.</i>

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,079
<i>'The First Graders'?</i>

31
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,318
<i>Is it on the same theme?</i>

32
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:34,679
<i>Well, the theme isn't clear yet
because I don't work from a script.</i>

33
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,319
<i>It's based on impressions...
I've only started today.</i>

34
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,199
<i>To tell you the truth,
I came across a problem...</i>

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,919
<i>when I was helping my own child
with his homework.</i>

36
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,299
<i>Homework's supposed to be for kids
but adults are even more involved.</i>

37
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,339
<i>So I tought I'd bring a camera over
and see what's happening here.</i>

38
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,419
<i>See if it's only my child's problem,
my own problem...</i>

39
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,899
<i>or the educational system's.</i>

40
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,659
<i>So we'll be observing other parents
and children and hearing their views.</i>

41
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,379
<i>In fact, to give you the right
answer...</i>

42
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,899
<i>I'd say it's not a movie
in the usual sense.</i>

43
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,499
<i>It's a research project.</i>

44
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,859
<i>You could say it's a visual study
of pupils homework assignments.</i>

45
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,139
<i>Well, good luck to you.</i>

46
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,519
<i>Islam is victorious!</i>

47
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,959
<i>Down with the East and the West!</i>

48
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,279
<i>Say your prayer.</i>

49
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,559
<i>O Allah! Bless Mohammed
and his household!</i>

50
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:44,619
<i>In the name of God the Merciful,
the Compassionate.</i>

51
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,119
<i>In the name of God the Merciful,
the Compassionate.</i>

52
00:04:49,120 --> 00:05:00,479
<i>By the declining day,
Lo! man is in a state of loss.</i>

53
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:07,779
<i>Save those who believe
and do good works.</i>

54
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:13,499
<i>And exhort one another to truth.</i>

55
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,319
<i>And exhort one another to
endurance...</i>

56
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,619
<i>One and two and three and four.</i>

57
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,619
<i>Two and three and four and five,
The warriors are victorious.</i>

58
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,739
<i>Three and four and five and six,
Saddam's followers are doomed.</i>

59
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,219
<i>One and two and three and four,
Two and three and four and five.</i>

60
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:54,959
<i>Three and four and five and six,
Saddam's followers are doomed.</i>

61
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,459
<i>Moslems are victorious.</i>

62
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,639
<i>The first Imam?
- Is Ali.</i>

63
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,538
<i>Lion-hearted one?
- Is Ali.</i>

64
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,819
<i>Conqueros of Kheibar?
- Is Ali.</i>

65
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,099
<i>The first Imam?
- Is Ali.</i>

66
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,019
<i>Religious leader?
- Is Ali.</i>

67
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,259
<i>Guardian of religion?
- Is Ali.</i>

68
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,759
What was your name?

69
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,560
What?

70
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,999
Adjust the light a little.

71
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,979
That's fine now.
- Right, let's start.

72
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,179
Sound!

73
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,359
Camera!

74
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,199
Well, why don't you do your
homework in time?

75
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,799
My brother always says...

76
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,519
My mum's out working...

77
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,279
and I always tell my brother
to write his dictation.

78
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,679
Then I read his dictation to him
and write mine as well.

79
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,639
<i>You have to do it all yourself?
Is there no one to help you?</i>

80
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,539
My sister got married. There's
only me and my older brother...

81
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,999
<i>Why doesn't your older
brother do it?</i>

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,639
My older brother's working.
There's just the two of us at home.

83
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,719
<i>So who reads your dictation
to you then?</i>

84
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,439
I take it to my sister's house.

85
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,719
Does she live nearby?
- Her house is near Pars.

86
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,839
<i>Who looks after your brother then?</i>

87
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,399
My mum and dad are back home
by then.

88
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,399
<i>Couldn't your mum and dad read
your dictation to you?</i>

89
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,499
My dad's busy with his plants and
all that and my mum's busy cooking.

90
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,499
<i>I see. So your sister has to read
your dictation to you?</i>

91
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,539
Isn't your sister busy? - No.
- Dosen't she do the cooking?

92
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:28,739
She does the cooking at night
and I go to her every afternoon.

93
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,179
<i>So you go to her place
and then return home.</i>

94
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,539
<i>Why haven't you done your
homework?</i>

95
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,619
I do it most of the time.

96
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,979
<i>Perhaps, but sometimes you don't.
Why?</i>

97
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,699
Once in a while, like on Fridays,
our teacher...

98
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,739
She gives us a lot of homework...

99
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,859
She give us three assignments...

100
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,139
for the same lesson.

101
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,699
And a lot of dictation and maths.

102
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,239
<i>And you don't have enough time?</i>

103
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,579
<i>Can you dad read and write?</i>

104
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,259
What about your mother?
- No.

105
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,499
<i>Who helps you with your lessons
at home?</i>

106
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,219
It's me... and our landlady.
- How?

107
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,619
When I have a dictation, I go to our
landlady and she reads it out to me...

108
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,099
Not the landlady... her daughters
read it out to me.

109
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,659
Her daughters do that?
- Yes.

110
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,139
<i>What time do you finish your
homework?</i>

111
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:34,629
I don't know.

112
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,249
You mean it takes a long time?
- Well, a little.

113
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,409
<i>What do you do apart from
homework?</i>

114
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,209
<i>Does your mother make you
run errands?</i>

115
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,119
Writing dictation...
Learning Farsi...

116
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,239
No, I mean housework.
- Housework?

117
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,999
I don't know what housework is.
- You don't?

118
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,199
<i>Do you ever go to buy bread?</i>

119
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,639
No, only when we run out of bread.

120
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,439
<i>So you don't go when there's
bread at home?</i>

121
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,479
<i>How about buying other things?</i>

122
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,579
Fruit... yes, I buy fruit.

123
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,159
<i>Do you get punished when you
don't do your homework well?</i>

124
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,999
They punish me when I don't
do my homework well.

125
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,700
Who?

126
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,249
Our teacher.

127
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,849
<i>How about at school, at home,
your parents?</i>

128
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,049
My parents beat me up.

129
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,099
<i>How do they beat you up?</i>

130
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,199
I don't know.

131
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,919
<i>How can you not know how
you get beaten up?</i>

132
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,719
Belt...
- With a belt.

133
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,119
<i>How do they know you didn't do
well if they can't read or write?</i>

134
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,399
When I show them my notebooks,
they say it's bad.

135
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,159
<i>But they're not educated.
How do they find out it's bad?</i>

136
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,439
Because it's big.

137
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,539
<i>So big is bad?</i>

138
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,439
<i>What if you buy big fruit?
Do they beat you up?</i>

139
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:08,959
<i>No. How about praise?
Do they ever encourage you?</i>

140
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,678
No.
- Never? - No.

141
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:14,839
But they do punish you.
- Punish, yes.

142
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,439
What was that?
- Punishment, yes.

143
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,959
<i>But they're never praised you?</i>

144
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,619
<i>How about at school?</i>

145
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,699
At school?

146
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,499
At school, no.

147
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,499
<i>Not even at school?</i>

148
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,459
A good-marks card?
- I didn't get one.

149
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,539
But you're a good pupil,
your teacher says so.

150
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,699
I'm bad at dictation.

151
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,579
<i>Maybe they don't read it out well
enough, your landlady's daughters.</i>

152
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,019
<i>If your teacher was away, you
wouldn't have homework...</i>

153
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,779
Who'd give me sample lines to copy?

154
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,619
<i>You wouldn't have to copy anything,
you'd watch TV instead.</i>

155
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,899
<i>Honestly, which do you like best,
cartoons or homework?</i>

156
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,499
Homework.

157
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,059
<i>Tell me about your favourite
cartoons.</i>

158
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,939
I like... I like Pinocchio.

159
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:19,659
What else?
- I like The Bear Family.

160
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,619
<i>The Bear Family.</i>

161
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,219
<i>Which do you like best, homework
or The Bear Family?</i>

162
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,579
When I finish my homework...
- And if you don't finish it?

163
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,139
I do my homework...
I watch TV in the evening.

164
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,458
<i>There's no Bear Family on TV
in the evening, only the news.</i>

165
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,539
<i>Don't you watch the news?</i>

166
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,458
I go to bed when the news is on.

167
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,699
<i>You go to bed. Good boy!</i>

168
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,339
Have you ever got a twenty?
- No.

169
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,958
<i>Do your parents know what a
twenty is?</i>

170
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,679
How about your landlady?
- Our landlady... yes.

171
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,278
<i>If you got a good grade...
a twenty...</i>

172
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,119
<i>How would you expect to be
rewarded?</i>

173
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,299
<i>What do you wish them to buy you?</i>

174
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,058
Cookies.

175
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,779
Sorry?
- Cookies.

176
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,899
<i>You like cookies?
And if you got a twenty?</i>

177
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,339
Two cookies.

178
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,278
<i>Two cookies? What if you got
three twenties?</i>

179
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,679
<i>What was that?</i>

180
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,079
More cookies.

181
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,079
How many cookies?
- Three.

182
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:44,239
<i>Three? So what would you like
if you got twenty in all subjects?</i>

183
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,939
In all subjects?

184
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,689
<i>Maybe a cookie shop?</i>

185
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,628
Can your dad read?
- No.

186
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,549
<i>What about your mother?</i>

187
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,329
My mother's studying at the
Literacy Movement centre.

188
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,229
<i>She's studying. Does she help you
with your lessons, then?</i>

189
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:13,029
She can't read yet.
I help her with her lessons now.

190
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,709
<i>You help her with her lessons...
that's nice.</i>

191
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,469
So who helps you?
- My sister.

192
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,349
<i>Does she punish you?
Do you know what punishment is?</i>

193
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,749
What is it?
- Beating up.

194
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,549
<i>Do you know what praise is?</i>

195
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,669
It means applause.
- Sorry?

196
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,869
People cheer you.

197
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,909
What does award mean?
- Award means...

198
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,509
I don't know.

199
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,869
<i>Don't you?</i>

200
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,549
Last night I wanted to do
my maths homework...

201
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,549
but suddenly my mum told me
to go to bed.

202
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,629
<i>You had to study maths at night?</i>

203
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,369
I finished my homework late.

204
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,969
Did you work late?
- Very late.

205
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,229
<i>Did you watch cartoons too?</i>

206
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,109
Cartoons... no.
- Why not?

207
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,889
I was doing my homework...

208
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:09,469
I wrote a dictation too...
it was two pages long.

209
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,149
That took a long time.

210
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,489
<i>So you couldn't watch cartoons.</i>

211
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,889
Did you want to?
- Yes.

212
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:21,389
Sometimes our teacher gives us a
little homework and sometimes a lot.

213
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,129
<i>So she gave you a lot?</i>

214
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,389
I don't know how long it took...

215
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:34,069
Yes, sometimes it's a lot
and sometimes it's a little.

216
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:38,249
Sometimes my mum gets cross.

217
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,289
<i>How?</i>

218
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,029
Like...

219
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:47,469
Like when we have a party and
I haven't finished my homework.

220
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,229
I ask her to wait till I finish...

221
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,909
and then she gets a bit cross.

222
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,509
She gets cross, does she?
- Yes.

223
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,689
<i>Couldn't you take your homework
to the party and do it there?</i>

224
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,469
There are lot of kids.

225
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,549
<i>So you couldn't, could you?</i>

226
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,329
The kids tear up my notebooks.

227
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:13,749
We had a test. - In what?
- Social studies.

228
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,629
<i>Did you do well?</i>

229
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:20,109
I had trouble with two questions
but I finally answered them.

230
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,829
<i>What were the questions?
Do you remember any of them?</i>

231
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,403
One was "fill in the blanks".

232
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:28,129
What's "fill in the blanks"?

233
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,269
Like: "Children are 'blank'
entrusted to their parents...

234
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,709
"...and they must strive to 'blank'
them".

235
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,909
The answer is:

236
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:47,509
"Children are a gift from God
entrusted to their parents...

237
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:51,629
"...and they must strive
to care for them".

238
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,429
<i>You're a good pupil
but you're weak in maths.</i>

239
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,829
Who helps you?
- I go to my brother's house.

240
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,549
<i>Does he help you with your maths?</i>

241
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,069
Yes, but he's not very nice.

242
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:10,529
I have to do something for him
whenever he helps me.

243
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,549
Like get his notebooks,
make him tea and so on.

244
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,189
<i>Does your dad know modern maths?
Can he help you?</i>

245
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,929
My dad...

246
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,909
He could have helped once...

247
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,389
but he can't do the multiplications
and divisions we do today...

248
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:31,029
so I have to ask my teacher.

249
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,949
<i>Why not your brother?
How old is he?</i>

250
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,729
Eighteen.

251
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,229
<i>Why didn't you ask him?</i>

252
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:43,349
First when I was writing,
he said it was wrong...

253
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:47,949
and when I asked how it should be,
he didn't answer.

254
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,149
Charlie Chaplin movies.
- You like Charlie Chaplin?

255
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,549
How about Pinocchio?
- I like Pinocchio too.

256
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:59,709
<i>But your mum says you watch TV
before finishing your homework.</i>

257
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,269
There's too much.
- Too much what?

258
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,549
Too much homework.
- Too much homework or cartoons?

259
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,429
Homework.

260
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,909
<i>She says you didn't finish it
even after the news.</i>

261
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:13,369
Well, I couldn't... there's so much
homework that...

262
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,008
that I have to study until midnight.

263
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:19,249
You study until midnight?
- Yes.

264
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,569
<i>What's better, homework
or cartoons?</i>

265
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,569
Both, cartoons and homework.

266
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:29,129
<i>Which do you like best?
Which do you enjoy most?</i>

267
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,489
Homework.
- Homework is more fun?

268
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,569
Look at me!
Are you telling the truth?

269
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,649
Yes.

270
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:42,169
<i>Since homework's more fun, are you
ready to give up watching cartoons?</i>

271
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,509
Yes... - So you'll give that up?
- Cartoons are fun too.

272
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,229
<i>What was your dream about?</i>

273
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:54,329
It was about Long Nose.
- You dreamt of Long Nose?

274
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,749
<i>Do you dream about homework?</i>

275
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,409
About exams?

276
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:06,389
Do you dream about homework?
- I do. - How?

277
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,989
I dream of getting a fourteen.

278
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,709
Really? Do you feel happy then?
- No.

279
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,349
Why not, is fourteen a bad grade?
- Yes.

280
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,709
Who says fourteen is bad?

281
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,749
I don't like getting fourteen
- What do you like?

282
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,949
Twenty.

283
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,789
Have you ever got a twenty?
- Yes.

284
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,719
<i>How were you treated when
you got a twenty?</i>

285
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,399
Alright.
- What do you you meant "alright"?

286
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,839
It's obvious they would...

287
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,939
They praised me,
they said it's good.

288
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,718
<i>Why leave your homework
until after cartoons?</i>

289
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:44,219
The other day I did study...
but I forgot everything in class.

290
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,779
When you forget your lessons,
when you're absent-minded...

291
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,299
How do you expect to be treated?

292
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,299
<i>What should they do so you
don't forget?</i>

293
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,799
Do you know?
- It's fine the way it is.

294
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,659
<i>What would you like as a reward?</i>

295
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,599
Anything.

296
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,559
<i>Like what?</i>

297
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,179
I don't know.

298
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,299
<i>What about punishment?</i>

299
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,318
I don't like punishment...
- What was that?

300
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,199
I don't like being punished,
I'd rather work well.

301
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,839
Who reads your dictation at home?
- My brother.

302
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,239
<i>What does he do
if you don't do it well?</i>

303
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,479
<i>What if you do a bad dictation?</i>

304
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:42,419
He beats me up.
- What?

305
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,139
He beats me up.

306
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,639
<i>Why didn't you do your homework?</i>

307
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,519
Because my uncle's family came
to visit.

308
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,558
<i>So what happened?</i>

309
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,899
I couldn't do my homework.

310
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,679
<i>How long did they stay?</i>

311
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,959
Until ten.

312
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,218
<i>How long did it take you to
do your homework?</i>

313
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,958
Until eleven.
- Eleven p.m.?

314
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,739
<i>Weren't you sleepy?</i>

315
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,499
<i>Did you watch a cartoons?</i>

316
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,427
<i>Wich cartoons?</i>

317
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,559
Don't you remember?
- No.

318
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,059
<i>Doesn't your mum get cross when
you don't do your homework?</i>

319
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,219
Your dad, any of them?
- Yes, they get cross with me.

320
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,819
<i>What did you say when they
got cross with you last night?</i>

321
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,419
I said we had guests.

322
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,259
<i>And you can't do homework
with guests there.</i>

323
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,539
<i>How often do you have guests
or visit people in a week?</i>

324
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:46,099
I don't know.

325
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,059
<i>What happens when you go visiting?</i>

326
00:21:49,419 --> 00:21:51,299
I can't study.

327
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,879
Do you have a lot of homework?
- A lot.

328
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,959
You see, we've got a little baby
who doesn't go to school.

329
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,959
She comes in and bites my back
when I'm trying to do homework.

330
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:12,059
<i>So you can't finish your
homework in time?</i>

331
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,299
<i>What other reasons are there?</i>

332
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,059
I don't know.

333
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,419
Sometimes my mum soaks me
with water.

334
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,279
<i>She soaks you?
Do you like cartoons?</i>

335
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,459
Yes.
- How much?

336
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,459
A bit, but I like homework more
than cartoons.

337
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,219
<i>You prefer homework?</i>

338
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,618
Yes, because I'm learning.

339
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,259
<i>Has your mum ever punished you
for not doing your homework in time?</i>

340
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,299
Yes.
- How?

341
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,499
Our baby is very naughty...

342
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,789
She comes in and throws my pencils
and the points get broken...

343
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,749
then my mum blames me and says
I sharpen my pencils too often.

344
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,369
Does your mum punish you?
- Yes. - How?

345
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,969
She beats me up and says:
"Don't you ever do that again!"

346
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:10,709
She doesn't beat me with a belt.
She only says: "Don't do it again!"

347
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:16,789
"This is a bad thing to do"
or "Do your homework earlier"

348
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,469
<i>Why would she use a belt?</i>

349
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,169
I don't know.
She has my dad's belt.

350
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,789
He doesn't wear a belt
very often.

351
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:28,149
He's a bit fat around here...
and doesn't like to wear a belt.

352
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:33,349
And my mum sometimes takes the
belt and hides it somewhere...

353
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:38,189
to beat me up if I get naughty.

354
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:44,429
Once she had hidden the belt
somewhere and...

355
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:50,568
and a few days later, when she
wanted to beat me up...

356
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:54,429
she realised the belt wasn't there.

357
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:58,549
Who had taken in?
- My mum... I don't know who.

358
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:04,189
So your dad doesn't need a belt.
- Yes, because he's got a big belly.

359
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,149
<i>So your mum uses the belt
for punishment...</i>

360
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:09,489
Yes, all his belts get lost.

361
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:14,909
He's lost more than ten belts...
he buys and loses, buys and loses.

362
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:21,349
Once we were moving house
and we found a few belts.

363
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,149
They were all found at once.
- Yes, but I wasn't beaten up.

364
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,668
Besides, I helped them too
and hadn't started school yet.

365
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:32,989
<i>Do you wish he were thin
and had to wear a belt...</i>

366
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:36,268
<i>so there were no belts available
at home?</i>

367
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:39,709
<i>He's fat, so he doesn't need
a belt, right?</i>

368
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,989
I don't know why...

369
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,549
He's fat... he feels comfortable
that way.

370
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,749
Most people call him Mr. Chubby.

371
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,149
<i>I'm talking about his belt.</i>

372
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:54,229
<i>Now that he's fat and doesn't
buy belts...</i>

373
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,649
<i>So what's the belt for?
For punishment?</i>

374
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:02,409
My dad bought the belt
to beat us with...

375
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,849
and suddenly he couldn't find it.

376
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,829
<i>Did your mum hide it?</i>

377
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:11,869
My mum hid it and in the end we
realised it had been lost for days.

378
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:14,429
<i>When you grow up and have
children...</i>

379
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:17,189
<i>and your child doesn't do his
homework...</i>

380
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,709
<i>will you punish him with a belt?</i>

381
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:22,909
No.
- Why?

382
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,049
<i>Speak up so we can hear you.</i>

383
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,089
My dad didn't beat me up
and I wouldn't beat them either.

384
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,529
Wouldn't beat who?
- My children.

385
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,929
<i>Your children?
You won't beat them?</i>

386
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,329
<i>What if your dad had beaten you?</i>

387
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,489
I'd beat him too.
- You'd beat your son?

388
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:44,929
<i>It's not his fault... your dad
shouldn't have beaten you up.</i>

389
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,129
Well, I would beat him up.

390
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:52,089
You said you're the class monitor.
- Yes.

391
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,089
<i>Why did you become a moinitor?</i>

392
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:59,289
I'm a good pupil, they asked me
to be a monitor and I accepted.

393
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,649
<i>Do they also praise you at home
for being a good pupil?</i>

394
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,849
<i>How do they encourage you?</i>

395
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:12,249
For instance, my dad
buys me things.

396
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,289
And my mum buys me notebooks
or something...

397
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:19,729
drawing books, colouring pencils,
trousers or shirts.

398
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,529
<i>And punishment?
How have you been punished?</i>

399
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:28,789
Well, they slap me in the face...
slap me in the face.

400
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,689
Who does?
- My dad.

401
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,649
Do you think it's right?

402
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,689
No... for my dad?
- Yes.

403
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,409
Does he do the right thing?
- Yes.

404
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:39,029
<i>Why do you think so?</i>

405
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,989
Because we make him lose
his temper.

406
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,349
<i>How many times
does he slap you?</i>

407
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,709
Five or six times.

408
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:52,869
<i>Five or six... do you think
that's enough or not?</i>

409
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,689
That's enough.
- No more than that? - No.

410
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,129
What about less?
- Not less, no.

411
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:04,509
<i>So how many slaps would you give
your son if he were naughty?</i>

412
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,849
Seven.
- Seven times?

413
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,608
<i>So it's five from your dad
and seven from you?</i>

414
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:16,608
When my dad tells us to be quiet
and we don't he gets mad...

415
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:19,289
then he gets up and slaps us
seven times.

416
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,669
Seven times?
- Yes.

417
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:24,169
<i>Now, if you're tell your son...
what will you call him?</i>

418
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,729
I'll name him Hossein...

419
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,489
and if it's a girl,
I'll call her Sara.

420
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,089
<i>How many times will you slap
Hossein if he's not quiet?</i>

421
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,868
Dad's gone to the war...

422
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:37,709
He's at the front.

423
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,909
My mum always tells us
to go downstairs...

424
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,598
What's downstairs?
- My aunt's flat.

425
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:47,949
When we're at my aunt's, I don't
get round to doing my homework.

426
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:52,309
Mum knows you have homework?
- What?

427
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,868
<i>Do you tell your mum you have
homework?</i>

428
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,609
I say that... I have homework.

429
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,009
And she still tells you to go
to your aunt's?

430
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,929
Yes... no, my aunt forces us
to go there.

431
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:08,389
<i>Why don't you do your homework
at your aunt's?</i>

432
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,209
We take our books, but her children
keep bothering us.

433
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,469
<i>Who helps you with your lessons
at home?</i>

434
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:21,069
My mum, or my dad before he
went away... or my cousins.

435
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,789
<i>Do they read your dictation?</i>

436
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,609
Yeah, but badly.

437
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,609
<i>What's "badly"?</i>

438
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:31,169
I mean, they can't.

439
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,369
They can't read well?
- They just read too fast.

440
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:38,709
<i>They don't give you enough time?</i>

441
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:41,069
Yes.
- Why do they do that?

442
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,929
Well, I can't write fast.

443
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:55,049
I try to write well, nice handwriting,
but they say that I should write fast.

444
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,769
So they're in a hurry?
- Yes.

445
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,449
<i>What does your mum do?</i>

446
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:02,349
<i>Other than reading your dictation
to you?</i>

447
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:07,049
She sometimes does the washing
and, what do you call it? The dishes.

448
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:11,889
<i>Well, Mr. Keramati, what do you think
about encouragement?</i>

449
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,889
Encouragement!

450
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,529
<i>Do you think rewards are effective?</i>

451
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,149
How?
- They make you a good pupil.

452
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,229
How about punishment?
- What?

453
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,589
Punishment, no.

454
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,989
Why not?
- It makes kids even more stubborn.

455
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,589
<i>What makes them stubborn?</i>

456
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:39,929
I mean,
when you beat up the kid...

457
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,169
he gets stubborn and doesn't
do his homework.

458
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,729
<i>Then beating is useless.</i>

459
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,949
A little yes... a little no.

460
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,089
<i>Who helps you with your homework
at home?</i>

461
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,169
My sister.
- Your sister...

462
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,149
<i>How about your dad?
Why not?</i>

463
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,929
Because he can't read or write.

464
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,889
And your mother?
- She can't either.

465
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,569
Only my sister.

466
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,969
Your sister?
- And my brother.

467
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,449
Has she ever punished you?
- Who?

468
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:14,289
Your sister. Has she ever
punished you?

469
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:17,249
When?
- Do you know what punishment is?

470
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:21,649
What is it? - It's beating up.
- What? - It's beating up.

471
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,409
<i>What's encouragement?</i>

472
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,429
I don't know.

473
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,030
<i>Think...</i>

474
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,349
<i>You don't know what praise is?</i>

475
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,449
<i>What's punishment?</i>

476
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,429
It's getting beaten up.

477
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:39,989
Do you know what punishment is?
- Beating someone.

478
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,789
What's encouragement?
- Encouragement means well done!

479
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,189
<i>Who reads your dictation?</i>

480
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,389
My sister.

481
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:51,109
What happened to your face?
- My sister did that.

482
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,359
How?

483
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:57,319
She did it... we quarrelled...
and my sister scratched me.

484
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,119
<i>Who helps you with your lessons?
Who reads you dictation?</i>

485
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,839
My sister.

486
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,279
<i>Your sister?
Can your dad read and write?</i>

487
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,999
My dad, no.

488
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,269
<i>Do you know what punishment is?</i>

489
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,949
Punishment... yes.
- What does that mean?

490
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,029
Being beaten up.

491
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,629
<i>What does encouragement mean?</i>

492
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,849
<i>Do you know?</i>

493
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,369
Is your dad literate?
- No.

494
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,699
<i>So who helps you with your lessons?</i>

495
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,739
My sister.

496
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,179
<i>Does she punish you if you're
not prepared?</i>

497
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,019
<i>What's punishment?</i>

498
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,809
It's being beaten up.

499
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,929
And what's encouragement?
- I don't know.

500
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,609
You don't?
- No.

501
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,729
<i>What does it mean?</i>

502
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:01,729
It means that...

503
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:08,369
...you get beaten up when
you're naughty.

504
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,089
<i>What's encouragement?</i>

505
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,009
It's being treated well.

506
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,449
It means they beat you up.

507
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,589
<i>What does praise mean?</i>

508
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,189
It means they applaud you.

509
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,669
Were you ever punished?
- Yes. - How?

510
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,179
It's very simple.

511
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,699
<i>How?</i>

512
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,179
Well, they just beat you up.

513
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,139
<i>What do you want to be?</i>

514
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,499
A Committee engineer.

515
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,109
<i>Why do you want to be
a Committee engineer?</i>

516
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,029
For instance...

517
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,909
to arrest the drug addicts
and bad people...

518
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:54,109
To arrest people who accuse people
or steal...

519
00:32:54,310 --> 00:33:01,655
<i>[No translation]</i>

520
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:08,949
What was it you wanted to be?
- A Committee engineer.

521
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:14,009
<i>Do you like to be praised?</i>

522
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:17,149
Yes.
- What about punishment? - No.

523
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:20,189
<i>Who do you think must be punished?</i>

524
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:24,869
Bad boys.
- For doing what?

525
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:29,469
For instance, if they don't listen
to their mum and dad...

526
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:33,849
...or if they don't listen to what
the teacher says...

527
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:40,149
...or if they don't listen to what
the headmaster says.

528
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,069
Then...
- They must be punished.

529
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,429
Alireza Hassani.
- Mr. Hassani...

530
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,149
<i>Your teacher said you haven't done
your homework. Why?</i>

531
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:51,389
I learnt a poem by heart...
it's a song.

532
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,589
<i>What song?</i>

533
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:56,509
To sing at school on the 21st
of this month.

534
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:00,309
<i>Can you sing it for us?
Do you know it by heart?</i>

535
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,029
<i>Let's hear it, then.</i>

536
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,629
<i>So you don't know it by heart?</i>

537
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:26,029
<i>O caravan, don't be at a run,
the traveller is my beloved one.</i>

538
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:35,729
<i>The throbbing heart of mine
goes away with die dear one.</i>

539
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:43,829
<i>O camel driver, drive at leisure,
not like a deer.</i>

540
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:51,949
<i>As the love of that dear,
my soul goes not near.</i>

541
00:34:52,830 --> 00:35:00,029
<i>She walks away proudly,
leaving me behind so lonely.</i>

542
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:07,489
<i>Ask me about her no more,
from the sight goes the dear soul.</i>

543
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:16,609
<i>She's left me lonely and hurt,
in melancholy and regret.</i>

544
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:23,869
<i>As if her absence stings me
to the bone.</i>

545
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:31,889
<i>O caravan, don't be at a run,
the traveller is my beloved one.</i>

546
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:38,449
<i>That beating heart of mine
leaves me with the dear one.</i>

547
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:44,469
Did you say that you're
the lead singer? - Yes.

548
00:35:44,789 --> 00:35:47,549
<i>How come they made you lead
singer?</i>

549
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,189
One of the kids brought a poem.

550
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:54,069
The teacher wanted to know
who sang best.

551
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:58,109
My voice was the best of all,
so they chose me.

552
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,189
<i>On the third day of shooting...</i>

553
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:03,389
<i>we received 526 out of 856
questionnaires...</i>

554
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,709
<i>which had been sent to parents...</i>

555
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:10,989
<i>asking how pupils did their
homework.</i>

556
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,349
<i>More than 37% of the parents...</i>

557
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:19,499
<i>couldn't help their children with
their homework due to illiteracy.</i>

558
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,419
<i>Of the literate parents...</i>

559
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:28,759
<i>a large percentage was too tense,
exhausted, busy or impatient.</i>

560
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,919
<i>Many parents had been asking
the teachers...</i>

561
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,359
<i>to excuse them from
the resposibility...</i>

562
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,239
<i>of helping their children
with their homework.</i>

563
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,639
<i>Through these questionnaires,
we got to know those pupils...</i>

564
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,099
<i>whose difficulties were due
to special circumstances.</i>

565
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,789
What's wrong with your face?

566
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,609
My face... I fell down.
- Fell down?

567
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,208
Who helps you with your lessons
at home?

568
00:36:58,209 --> 00:37:02,329
My lessons? My mum helps me
with my lessons.

569
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:04,329
My grades aren't bad.

570
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:07,529
<i>Your teacher says that you've been
improving recently.</i>

571
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:09,608
Is that right?
- Yes.

572
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:12,889
<i>What do you have to do
to improve?</i>

573
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:15,909
Study every day... every day.

574
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:20,249
To do this... to study...
to get twenties.

575
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,249
To get twenties...

576
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,109
What are you going to be?

577
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,989
An engineer.

578
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,349
<i>How many brothers and sisters
do you have?</i>

579
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:37,909
Counting me, there are five boys...
also five girls.

580
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:44,029
<i>Five boys and five girls...
anyone else?</i>

581
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,669
I think there are eleven of us.

582
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:50,069
<i>Don't you know how many?</i>

583
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:54,949
I know,
but two of them are married.

584
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:59,829
And three of them aren't married
and one them is...

585
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,109
She's fifteen...

586
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:07,749
<i>Who helps you
with your homework?</i>

587
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:12,729
My sister, my brother,
my dad and my mum.

588
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:17,969
<i>Your dad said you don't finish your
homework until after the cartoons.</i>

589
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:24,249
Sometimes I don't finish it
before cartoons.

590
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:29,689
<i>He says Gholamreza seldom
finishes homework before the news.</i>

591
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:35,009
Why? - Not the 9 o'clock news,
he means the sports news at 7.

592
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:40,009
The sports news, like last night...
when they played in the water.

593
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:42,329
<i>Did you watch that?
Did you like it?</i>

594
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,809
Yes.

595
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:46,849
And cartoons,
do you like them? - Cartoons?

596
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,369
There's a bear and a fox...

597
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:54,769
and the fox plays a trick
on the bear...

598
00:38:56,290 --> 00:39:00,489
and then the hunter comes
and takes the bear...

599
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:03,088
and this... this fox...

600
00:39:03,089 --> 00:39:08,409
then these two mice free it
and they all go off together.

601
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:11,209
<i>What else do you like?</i>

602
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:14,449
Cinema, films...
- You like that.

603
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,529
We go to the cinema every Thursday.

604
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,329
<i>What was the last film you saw?</i>

605
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:25,409
The last one I saw... it was a film,
but I don't know its name...

606
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:27,969
but it was very interesting.

607
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,909
They fight in a boat.

608
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:35,449
<i>They fight in a boat...
is that a good thing?</i>

609
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:39,049
The Iranians are sitting
in a boat...

610
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:42,649
then two Iraqis come
and want to capture them.

611
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:46,209
Then one them goes
to keep watch.

612
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:52,009
And one gets smart and says:
"you can't beat me!"

613
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:56,948
And he pushed one of them...
he had a friend over there...

614
00:39:56,949 --> 00:40:03,849
then he did this and cut the man's
head off and threw him into the sea.

615
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,809
Did you like it?
- Yes.

616
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:08,249
Then the place where he...
- Wait, listen...

617
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:11,409
<i>You like fighting in films?</i>

618
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,569
I like it if it's in the war.

619
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:17,049
Do you like it at home too?
- At home, no.

620
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,769
<i>Do people fight in your home?</i>

621
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:21,729
At home,
the people downstairs...

622
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:24,649
They fight with their sister.
- Who are they?

623
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,789
My stepmother... both of them.

624
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:29,169
They're both your stepmothers?
- Yes.

625
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:33,769
First the woman downstairs...
she's the first wife.

626
00:40:34,689 --> 00:40:38,329
<i>He married her first?
And then your mother?</i>

627
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:43,369
Are they friendly?
- With my mother? It's not bad.

628
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,649
Don't they fight each other?
- No.

629
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,369
<i>Never?</i>

630
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:58,089
Sometimes they kid around,
they tease each other.

631
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,529
They argue too.

632
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,289
With each other?
- Yes.

633
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,569
<i>And does it upset you?</i>

634
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:07,489
My mum beats her up...
but...

635
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,649
She beats her up?
- Yes.

636
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:14,369
<i>And you're glad your mum
is stronger than her.</i>

637
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:19,288
The people downstairs have a boy
who's done his military service.

638
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:24,489
My dad takes their side and my
grandpa takes my mother's side.

639
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,249
My grandpa is stronger
than all of them.

640
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:29,729
He's even stronger than my dad.

641
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:32,849
There was a fight the other day.

642
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:36,169
Then the first wife's father came.

643
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:39,969
Her son came and beat my mum
and - that's my cousin...

644
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,789
And he picked him up.

645
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,289
He's the strongest and he works
at the Committee too.

646
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:50,649
Then he went and beat up my brother
who was beating up my mum.

647
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,349
<i>So he beat him up...
and you were pleased?</i>

648
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:56,569
<i>So do you like these fights or not?</i>

649
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,249
I don't.
- What do you like?

650
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,849
Nothing.

651
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:07,729
I'm not old enough to fight yet.

652
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,649
<i>Will you fight when you grow up?</i>

653
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,250
No.

654
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,889
Don't they fight at the front?

655
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:19,249
<i>The fight at the front is different...
it's war.</i>

656
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,569
What's the difference?

657
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:26,249
The difference is that we must kill.

658
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:32,769
If takes an hour to write
two pages...

659
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,529
I write two pages...

660
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,529
I copy numbers and...

661
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:42,649
and then the cartoons start.

662
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,329
Then you watch cartoons?
- Yes.

663
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,529
Do you like cartoons?
- No.

664
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:49,609
<i>Why do you watch it then?</i>

665
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,089
Cartoons? No...

666
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:58,729
I mean,
my little brother watches a lot.

667
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:03,249
<i>So it's your little brother who
doesn't do his homework.</i>

668
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,929
<i>But you ought to do yours.</i>

669
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,088
<i>What do you do after cartoons?</i>

670
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:11,729
After cartoons...

671
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:17,409
my mum makes me write
three more pages.

672
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:22,829
What does your dad do?
- My dad works at the store.

673
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:25,569
Isn't he at home?
- No.

674
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,209
<i>Then who reads your dictation
to you?</i>

675
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,209
Dictation?

676
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:33,929
My dad comes home at night...

677
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:37,169
I mean, at noon,
and reads it out to me.

678
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:42,708
<i>Have your mum and dad ever
punished you? How?</i>

679
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:47,889
He gets the belt and
beats me up.

680
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:54,488
Does he praise you? Do you
know what praise is? - No.

681
00:43:54,489 --> 00:43:56,889
<i>Has he ever given you a reward?</i>

682
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,889
<i>He hasn't?</i>

683
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,969
<i>Do you help with the housework?</i>

684
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,249
<i>What do you do?</i>

685
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:11,129
My mum asks me to get
the bread-basket...

686
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,809
and I go and get it.

687
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,369
<i>What else?</i>

688
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:21,689
Then she wants me to wash the cups
and I go and wash them.

689
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:27,689
She asks me to get the kerosene
so I go and get it.

690
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,969
<i>What else does she ask?</i>

691
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:34,969
She tells me to go... to go...

692
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:38,608
to go and get the dishes for her
so she can wash them...

693
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:43,929
then I go and get them
and she washes them.

694
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:46,069
<i>What else?</i>

695
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:50,309
Then in the moming...

696
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:57,588
at night, she wants me to go and
get the food, so I go and get it.

697
00:44:57,589 --> 00:44:59,869
<i>What does your mum do?</i>

698
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:04,069
My mum... nothing...
she's ill.

699
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:07,369
<i>Your mum's ill?</i>

700
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:14,349
Sorry?
- I don't want to be punished.

701
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,669
You don't? - No.
- How about encouragement?

702
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:22,489
I like it.

703
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,669
Is your dad literate?

704
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:28,170
Yes.

705
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:32,409
<i>What about your mum?</i>

706
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:43,449
No.

707
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:47,208
<i>So who helps you with
your homework?</i>

708
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:52,489
I do my homework...

709
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:56,089
as soon as I get home.

710
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:59,369
<i>Why does it take you so long
to finish it?</i>

711
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:02,709
Until bedtime...
- There's too much homework.

712
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:04,889
<i>When does your dad come home?</i>

713
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,049
7 o'clock in the evening.

714
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:11,949
<i>And then he helps you with
your lessons?</i>

715
00:46:13,889 --> 00:46:15,489
Yes.

716
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,829
<i>Can he do your maths problems?</i>

717
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:21,069
My maths problems? Yes.

718
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:23,589
<i>Who reads your dictation to you?</i>

719
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,269
My sister.

720
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:28,549
<i>Does she punish you?</i>

721
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,789
Once in a while.

722
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:35,469
Does she beat you up?
- Yes.

723
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:38,229
<i>Why didn't you do your homework
last night?</i>

724
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:40,449
I couldn't.
- What?

725
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:42,929
I couldn't.
- Why?

726
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,239
Speak up so I can hear you.
- My brother annoyed me.

727
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,079
How did he annoy you?
- He didn't let me write.

728
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,599
<i>He didn't let you?
How old is your brother?</i>

729
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,519
Nine.
- Nine?

730
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,679
<i>Is he older than you?</i>

731
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,879
<i>Didn't you tell your mum to
make him stop upsetting you?</i>

732
00:47:10,919 --> 00:47:12,519
<i>Why?</i>

733
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,999
<i>Did you do your maths problems?</i>

734
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,419
<i>You haven't done maths either?</i>

735
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,720
Who reads your dictation to you?

736
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,399
My sister or my brother.

737
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,639
Your sister or...
- My brother.

738
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:32,379
How about your mother?
- No. - Why?

739
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,879
I don't know.
- Is she literate? - No.

740
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,419
<i>Who reads dictation better,
your sister or your brother?</i>

741
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,699
What?
- My sister.

742
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,939
<i>Your sister...
and who is kinder?</i>

743
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,019
Who?
- My sister.

744
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,959
<i>Doesn't your dad read your
dictation for you?</i>

745
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,099
<i>Why?</i>

746
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,259
<i>Why doesn't he?</i>

747
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,479
My dad can't...
- Why?

748
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,039
He works for the bus company.

749
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:13,999
What does he do?
- He works for the bus-line...

750
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,599
We didn't hear you.
- Dad works on buses.

751
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,559
<i>So he can't read your dictation
to you.</i>

752
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,799
<i>I see... you can go.</i>

753
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:30,559
My child doesn't go to this school
but I live around here.

754
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:34,159
I've come to discuss
transferring him to this school.

755
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,599
I heard you're making a film
about homework...

756
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:40,599
and I thought I'd come and
discuss some problems with you.

757
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,639
<i>Please do.</i>

758
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:46,199
I've lived for many years
in foreign countries...

759
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:50,119
first studying and then working.

760
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:56,419
I've observed the educational
systems in other countries.

761
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,979
In many countries, America
and Canada for example...

762
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,339
there's no such thing as homework.

763
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,099
In countries where they still have
homework...

764
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:09,019
the emphasis is mostly on
the children's creativity.

765
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:13,539
For instance, in England they mostly
work on drawing, handicrafts...

766
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:17,339
geography, composition
and other such subjects.

767
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:22,259
They don't say: "For good handwriting
you must write, write and write!"

768
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,619
The pupils are taught the rules
of good handwriting...

769
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:29,099
because there are, of course,
rules and methods.

770
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,339
But once you learn them,
you acquire the skill.

771
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:36,739
In Japan, where the traditional system
of hard work has been in effect...

772
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,899
the rate of suicide among children
increased.

773
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:45,979
For a while now, they've been revising
the system, creating new ones...

774
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:49,099
as the old system isn't effective
any more.

775
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:53,619
As we can see, with this system
our kids are under great pressure.

776
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:59,259
Teachers seem to know how to
tackle the problem and live with it.

777
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:02,859
But when the kids get home, they
have to deal with us, home teachers...

778
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,379
and we have no idea what to do.

779
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,499
We haven't been trained to
deal with it.

780
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:13,339
What we actually do is dump our
own frustrations on the children...

781
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:18,419
and we end up with an indignant,
surly and defensive generation...

782
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:22,099
susceptible to every possible
mental problem.

783
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:26,539
With such pressure and unhappiness
imposed on our kids...

784
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:30,699
we'll end up with a generation
lacking in any creativity.

785
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:34,429
<i>[No translation]</i>

786
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,059
...capable only of copying.

787
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:40,939
We need to move on into
the 20th century...

788
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,919
or we'll end up with nothing.

789
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:49,629
We should use whatever resources
we have to do something about it.

790
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,289
The Ministry of Education,
in my opinion...

791
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:55,569
ought to change the current system.

792
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:58,609
This system belongs in
the Middle Ages...

793
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:03,419
yet our education authorities
still uphold it.

794
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:08,379
Teachers must think differently
however hard it might be for them.

795
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:10,999
Kids must be made to us
their imagination...

796
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,099
but not beyond their capacity.

797
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:18,699
I believe parents should leave the
children to themselves at home.

798
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:24,459
It's basically wrong for parents to
force their kids to do homework...

799
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:27,459
because kids tend to react to
such pressure.

800
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:33,019
By building up natural resistance
against the education system.

801
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,299
We don't know their
maths or literature.

802
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,459
Modern education systems
have been put into practice...

803
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:43,739
but we're overworking these kids
under unnecessary pressure.

804
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:48,499
I believe that children must be
allowed to be naughty, to rebel...

805
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:53,258
and develop their own ways of
resisting these rules and regulations.

806
00:51:53,259 --> 00:51:55,539
After all, we can't expect our kids...

807
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,659
to accept everything
without question.

808
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,739
Another point I wanted to make...

809
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:08,019
relates to the special circumstances
which most kids have to face.

810
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:12,858
There's a new system of teaching
maths, literature and so forth...

811
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,619
Parents are not familiar with it.
It's completely new.

812
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:21,738
The government's established new
teacher training colleges...

813
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:24,979
to train teachers in the new
methods.

814
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,899
But at parent-teacher meetings...

815
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:32,899
the parents are asked whether they
help the children with their lessons.

816
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,059
The child comes home confused,
asking questions and expecting help.

817
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:40,339
The parents, who aren't familiar
with the new methods...

818
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,339
try teaching the child
the old way...

819
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,419
and it all ends up in arguments.

820
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:51,299
Part of the responsibility is dumped
on older brothers or sisters...

821
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,299
and that makes the problem worse.

822
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:58,619
For instance, I'm in my room, I hear
them arguing and go in to intervene.

823
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,299
I ask: "What's going on?"

824
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,839
My elder son says he's trying to help
his brother with his homework.

825
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:08,559
The younger boy says it's wrong,
that's not what the teacher told him.

826
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,519
I look at it and get neither the boys'
nor the teacher's method.

827
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,199
The point is:

828
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:19,859
if I'm supposed to be qualified
to teach my children at home...

829
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:23,039
then what's the teacher
training college for?

830
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,639
If that's not the case...

831
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,839
they should send me on
a training course...

832
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,739
so I know what to do.

833
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,579
Are there any questions?
- Yes.

834
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:36,878
I want to ask whether you and
your wife have disagreements...

835
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,239
concerning your children.

836
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:43,119
A lot. I believe that the child's
grade is excellent...

837
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,339
if it's just a little above a pass.

838
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:51,999
The idea that the child must get
twenty in every subject is nonsense.

839
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,199
However, my wife insists...

840
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,399
that the child must be top pupil
and reach top level in every subject.

841
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,399
My child has a talent for music
and art...

842
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:07,979
even for maths, but not for subjects
which require memorising, like History.

843
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,879
In addition, all subjects, even
literature...

844
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,598
are taught with a religious
perspective.

845
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:19,559
Now, apart from his difficulty
in memorisin information...

846
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:23,359
he has trouble copying the same
lesson several times.

847
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,639
His teacher wants them to copy
each complicated word twice.

848
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:32,159
It really seems as if they want to
suppress all the child's imagination.

849
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,599
I went to his school...

850
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:37,799
asked them to revise the method,
find better ways to teach maths...

851
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:42,919
I strongly feel that children must
develop a personality.

852
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,519
We have to give him as much
as we can...

853
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,239
The 21st century is going to be
different.

854
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,399
Right now, on the other side
of the globe...

855
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:58,719
children start working with
computers from the earliest age.

856
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,319
They deal with emotional
and mental problems.

857
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,479
What I'm getting at...

858
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,739
refers to the proverb of the Indian
telling the British...

859
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:12,579
not to give him the fish
out of the river...

860
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,819
but rather teach him
how to catch it.

861
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,819
We shouldn't give our children
the fish.

862
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:20,219
We should teach them
how to catch it.

863
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,539
We must teach them
how to think.

864
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,619
But with our system of education...

865
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:28,179
the children might learn everything,
though I doubt it...

866
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:31,419
but they certainly won't
learn how to think.

867
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:38,619
Pinocchio...
I said: only Pinocchio.

868
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,439
Only Pinocchio?
- Yes.

869
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,319
Do you watch other programmes?
- No. No.

870
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,399
Did you like the show last night?
- It was fine.

871
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,659
Your mother says you're very
cheeky. Is that right?

872
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,060
Yes.

873
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,739
I don't like it.
- Don't like what?

874
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:00,499
Being cheeky.

875
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,979
<i>What do you do, then?</i>

876
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,659
I just sit there because I can't do
anything...

877
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:08,739
unless the teacher writes the
example lines in my notebook...

878
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,319
so I can copy them at home.

879
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,498
My sister now lives at my uncle's...

880
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:18,398
so she can't write the example line
for me.

881
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:22,869
<i>Who helps you with arithmetic
and other lessons?</i>

882
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:27,489
My older brother does...

883
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:29,469
Abbas Abedy...

884
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:32,429
He helps me with my lessons.

885
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:37,109
Is he nice or harsh?
- He's harsh. - How?

886
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:41,149
He beats me up...

887
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:46,669
This brother of mine... he's in
second grade and I'm in first.

888
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:50,229
<i>So a second grader is teaching
a first grader...</i>

889
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:52,709
<i>and what's more,
he's harsh too.</i>

890
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,369
<i>Is there no one else to help you?
Your mum?</i>

891
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,729
My mum's illiterate.

892
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:03,809
How about your dad?
- My dad?

893
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:05,969
So is my dad.

894
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:11,069
<i>Are you punished when you don't
do your homework in time?</i>

895
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,770
Yes...

896
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:16,009
Who punishes you?
- My teacher.

897
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:19,409
<i>Does anyone punish you at home?</i>

898
00:57:20,149 --> 00:57:21,949
My mum.

899
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:23,808
<i>How?</i>

900
00:57:23,809 --> 00:57:25,709
With a belt.

901
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:29,309
What does she do with it?
- She beats me up.

902
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:32,929
<i>What do you want to be?</i>

903
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,709
A pilot.

904
00:57:36,509 --> 00:57:38,009
<i>Why?</i>

905
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:40,249
To kill Saddam.

906
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:45,119
Saddam is cruel, because
he destroys houses...

907
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:48,019
He ruins them.

908
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,039
<i>And if Saddam is dead by then,
what will you be?</i>

909
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:18,239
The ones with a heart that
doesn't work...

910
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,940
<i>Who?</i>

911
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,599
People who have heart trouble...

912
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:29,279
people who go to the hospital,
who get ill...

913
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,399
who have to lie down and have
an operation.

914
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:36,079
You want to operate on them?
- Yes.

915
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,239
So you want to be a physician.
- Yes.

916
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,919
A pilot and a physician, both.

917
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:46,359
<i>Islam is victorious!
Down with the East and the West!</i>

918
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:53,439
<i>We're not going to hurt you.
Why'are you crying?</i>

919
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,399
What is it?
- My friend's gone.

920
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,239
What?
- My friend's gone.

921
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,999
Your friend?
- Yes.

922
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,519
<i>That's no reason to cry, is it?</i>

923
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,279
Tell my friend to come back.

924
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,539
Ask your fnend to come back?
- Yes.

925
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,679
You mean Molaie?
- Yes.

926
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,639
<i>Molaie!
You stay here, stay here...</i>

927
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:20,559
<i>Why do you cry when Molaie's not
here? We're not nasty to you.</i>

928
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,919
I want my friend.

929
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,479
You want your friend?
- Yes.

930
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:31,319
<i>You'll see him when you leave.</i>

931
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,799
Tell him to come back.

932
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,239
Who?
- Molaie.

933
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,239
You want Molaie to come?
- Yes, please.

934
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,559
You want to go?
- Yes! - Go, then.

935
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:01,499
<i>Molaie, why was your friend,
Madjid, crying?</i>

936
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:09,139
They were scolding the bad boys
in the first grade.

937
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:12,419
So now he's frightened.

938
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,799
Who's been scolding them?
- Our teacher.

939
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,239
<i>Has he been a bad boy?</i>

940
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:22,399
He hasn't been studying well
and he's been naughty too.

941
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,599
<i>How does she scold the bad boys?</i>

942
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,939
She beats them with a ruler.

943
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:32,219
We can't hear you.
- She beats them with a ruler.

944
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,519
<i>How?</i>

945
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:42,239
Once the teacher beat him
and the ruler broke.

946
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:46,779
Speak up.
- The ruler got broken...

947
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:53,719
so the teacher said that she'd use
a cane from now on.

948
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:58,619
So now he's frightened.
- Is he always like this?

949
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:02,059
How? - What grade are you in?
- Second grade.

950
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,419
Is he in your class?
- Yes.

951
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:07,079
So that's why Madji's frightened...
- Yes.

952
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:11,679
<i>But we weren't going to hurt him,
we don't have any rulers here.</i>

953
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,399
I don't know why he's frightened.

954
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,559
He's always frightened.

955
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:18,439
<i>Is it the same in class?</i>

956
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,639
He's frightened when the bell
rings... he starts crying.

957
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:26,099
Or when the kids are called out
for punishment.

958
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:29,919
Sometimes he cries during break too.

959
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,999
So it's not our fault?
- No.

960
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,739
<i>We have no rulers, so
why is he scared of us?</i>

961
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,599
I don't know.

962
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:49,539
<i>Say it again, I didn't hear you.</i>

963
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:53,339
He thought you have a ruler
hidden here somewhere...

964
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:59,299
and you'd bring him in and beat
him up after you closed the door.

965
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,619
But you don't think so?
- No.

966
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,479
Aren't you scared?
- No. - That's good.

967
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,919
In respect to his teacher's report...

968
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,499
claiming he's not working enough
at school and is lagging behind...

969
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:16,939
and also mentioning the possiblity
of his bein retarded...

970
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,199
we became very concerned.

971
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,819
We tried to help him with his lessons
but without success.

972
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:28,959
The problem was that we weren't
familiar with the new methods...

973
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,239
and, as a result,
we got confused.

974
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:34,839
All we did was transfer the stress
onto the child.

975
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:40,799
At school, of course, he was one
of the problem pupils...

976
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:45,419
and when he came home
in the evening...

977
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:48,339
we put him under pressure
to improve.

978
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:52,379
But he wasn't responsive, perhaps
because of his mental state...

979
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:55,059
but also his lack of interest
in studying...

980
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:59,499
due to our inability to explain the
lesson with the proper information...

981
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,699
and help him understand it.

982
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:06,539
Consequently, his tension and
anxiety gradually increased...

983
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:13,259
to the extent that he probably came
to consider me as an aggressor.

984
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:20,181
Since I didn't want our arguments
to affect the other children...

985
01:03:20,182 --> 01:03:26,239
I would take him into another
room and perhaps close the door.

986
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:31,219
That, obviously, made him
even more anxious.

987
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:35,099
Of course I did nothing to hurt him
in that room...

988
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:37,659
except help him with his lessons...

989
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:41,659
or repeat the sentences
to him loudly.

990
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:45,519
Yet the child's mind was elsewhere.

991
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,739
He kept expecting the door to open...

992
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:52,899
and for someone to come in
and rescue him...

993
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:54,859
free him from captivity.

994
01:03:54,860 --> 01:04:01,859
<i>Yes, here he desperately needed his
friend to be with him to feel secure.</i>

995
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:06,129
<i>Who protects him at home? Who
gives him this sense of security?</i>

996
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:08,129
His mother.
- She protects him?

997
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:09,929
Too much, in fact.

998
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:13,809
If I try to work with him a bit longer
she tells me to stop...

999
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:17,809
either because his hands are
sweating or he's too tired.

1000
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:23,369
<i>Well, considering the way your son
behaved in this film...</i>

1001
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:27,029
<i>don't you think his mother's right?</i>

1002
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:31,089
<i>He was so anxious he couldn't
understand anything we said to him.</i>

1003
01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:35,089
This must be the case,
undoubtedly.

1004
01:04:35,090 --> 01:04:39,329
But we finally had to come
to the conclusion...

1005
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:41,889
that my method didn't work...

1006
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:46,369
but that his mother's emotional
protective method didn't work either.

1007
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:50,629
Either way,
the child was getting nowhere.

1008
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:54,849
He was still confused.
- So have you found a solution?

1009
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:03,289
Basically, I believe that the solution
must be found at school.

1010
01:05:03,290 --> 01:05:09,469
Time, subjects and number of pupils
must be organised in such a way...

1011
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:13,169
that pupils won't need to study
out of school...

1012
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:16,169
and we won't need to
teach the kids at home.

1013
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:19,769
Of course, homework can still be
done at home...

1014
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:23,089
but the actual learning should be
done at school.

1015
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:27,269
Then there won't be any problem.

1016
01:05:28,089 --> 01:05:33,829
We don't know how to teach
and can't be expected to do it.

1017
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:36,729
<i>Madjid, come and stand here.</i>

1018
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:39,929
<i>Can Molaie stay there?
Aren't you frightened?</i>

1019
01:05:39,930 --> 01:05:42,649
<i>Molaie, you stand behind him...</i>

1020
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:47,169
<i>You stay there and keep an eye on
Madjid because he's afraid of us.</i>

1021
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:49,489
<i>But why are you afraid of us?</i>

1022
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,609
I'm not afraid.

1023
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:55,529
<i>And if Molaie goes out?
Won't you be afraid then?</i>

1024
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:59,009
<i>Molaie, you can go now.</i>

1025
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:04,969
<i>Aren't you afraid any more?</i>

1026
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:10,169
<i>So why were you afraid of us
before?</i>

1027
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:16,248
My mind was somewhere else.

1028
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:19,409
And that's why you were scared.
- Right.

1029
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:22,489
What were you afraid of?
- Nothing.

1030
01:06:22,490 --> 01:06:25,369
<i>Did you think we would hurt you?</i>

1031
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:30,509
I didn't know.

1032
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:35,029
What did you think
we'd do to you? - Nothing.

1033
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:37,989
<i>We weren't going to hurt you.</i>

1034
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:46,069
<i>So if Molaie goes now,
you won't be afraid?</i>

1035
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:50,989
<i>Can I tell Molaie to go to his class?</i>

1036
01:06:53,189 --> 01:06:54,789
No.

1037
01:06:55,590 --> 01:07:02,139
Yes, yes.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

1038
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:05,469
Shall I call Molaie back?
- Yes.

1039
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:07,389
Stay here... I'll call Molaie back.
- All right.

1040
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:09,229
<i>Molaie!</i>

1041
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:15,069
<i>Djahan, bring Molaie back here.
Stay here, alright?</i>

1042
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:22,688
<i>Djahan!</i>

1043
01:07:22,689 --> 01:07:24,549
<i>Send Molaie back.</i>

1044
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:27,749
<i>Molaie, stand behind him...</i>

1045
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:32,309
<i>Is it alright with Molaie here?</i>

1046
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:35,988
<i>Molaie, move up here...
a little further... right...</i>

1047
01:07:35,989 --> 01:07:37,929
<i>Right, Molaie's here now.</i>

1048
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:40,388
<i>So you aren't you afraid now?</i>

1049
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:52,588
But our religion class is
about to start.

1050
01:07:52,949 --> 01:07:55,029
What class?
- Religion.

1051
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:58,549
Do you know the answers?
- No.

1052
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:01,789
None of them?
- No. - Why not?

1053
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:04,669
Didn't you prepare for the lesson?
- I did.

1054
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:07,349
Molaie, do you know the answers?
- No.

1055
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:10,909
<i>You don't either?
Do you know the questions?</i>

1056
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:13,010
I... no...

1057
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:17,369
Is that why you want to go?
- Yes.

1058
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:20,959
<i>Alright, Molaie can go now.
You'll join him later--</i>

1059
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,599
No, I go first and then he goes.

1060
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,119
You want to go first?
- Yes.

1061
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:30,479
<i>Tell me why you're afraid of us
and I'll let you go first.</i>

1062
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,319
<i>Just tell me.</i>

1063
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:39,779
I don't want to miss religion class.

1064
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,138
<i>Ask your classmates later.</i>

1065
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:46,379
Come near... nearer...
- I...

1066
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:51,819
Say one of your religion lessons.

1067
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:54,839
Do you know any?
Do you remember any?

1068
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,519
I can recite: "O Lord"
- Alright.

1069
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:02,579
<i>O Lord!
O thou, Lord of beautiful stars.</i>

1070
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:07,538
<i>O thou, Lord of colourful cosmos.
O thou, who created Venus.</i>

1071
01:09:07,539 --> 01:09:10,179
<i>Thou who created the moon
and the sun.</i>

1072
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:14,839
<i>All the mountains, hills, oceans.
The beautiful and colourful trees.</i>

1073
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:19,359
<i>Beautiful wings for the butterfly.
Nests for the birds.</i>

1074
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:24,399
<i>Happiness, games, strength.
Eyes for us to see.</i>

1075
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,899
<i>Snow and rain, heat and cold.</i>

1076
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:29,179
<i>We're all created by Thee,
O Lord.</i>

1077
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,999
<i>You granted all I wished for.</i>

1078
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,219
<i>Fill our hearts with happiness
and joy.</i>
