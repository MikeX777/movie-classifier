00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,998
SARJAN HASSAN (1958) 
Malay to English subtitles by ASEAN1984
Fansub in tribute to Malaysia's 
best director: P. Ramlee

2
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:55,388
My name is Hassan

3
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:57,009
A Sergeant

4
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:58,704
From the Royal Malay Regiment

5
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,369
I wish to share with
you, the story of my life

6
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:08,181
My mother died

7
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:11,187
When I was still very young

8
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,775
And I was raised by my father

9
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:17,933
But, when I was ten years old

10
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,973
My father died too

11
00:02:22,046 --> 00:02:26,506
It was then, that I felt really alone

12
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:31,143
I remember...

13
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:33,850
During my father's burial

14
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:38,946
I wanted to cry, but...

15
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:42,380
I realised my tears were in vain

16
00:02:43,615 --> 00:02:46,792
Who could I appeal to?

17
00:02:47,107 --> 00:02:50,026
Only to God, I've surrendered my fate

18
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:56,394
As a sign of a son's love for his father

19
00:02:56,595 --> 00:03:00,458
I could only plant one small
"remembrance tree" (pokok kenangan)

20
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,381
My heart felt a mix
of sadness and sorrow

21
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:13,681
My feet were heavy as I left my
father laying there alone in his grave

22
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:18,359
Only to become restless

23
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:22,251
Where would I live now?

24
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:26,287
Where?

25
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,204
Thank you, Uncle

26
00:03:29,314 --> 00:03:31,470
Where are you thinking of going?
- To find a home

27
00:03:31,726 --> 00:03:36,415
Do not worry. This is your home, too.
That is why I have brought you here.

28
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:40,041
Here?
- Yes

29
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:52,066
Minah!
- Yes, sir?

30
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:54,039
Alright now, don't cry anymore

31
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:56,452
I'm cooking rice now
- it might burn

32
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:59,229
I want to introduce my son to you

33
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:02,445
Your son?
- Hassan is his name

34
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:05,077
I thought your son's name was Aziz

35
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,293
That's true, but Hassan is also my son

36
00:04:08,502 --> 00:04:14,460
I've worked here for quite some time. 
Only now I know of another son.
- Alright, enough of your nonsense

37
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:19,905
Actually, he is my adopted son.
His father used to work with me

38
00:04:20,453 --> 00:04:26,520
Before he passed away, he requested 
if anything were to happen to him
- Hassan would be under my care

39
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:31,089
So, as he passed on - Hassan has now 
become my responsibility

40
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:34,766
Oh sir, my rice is burning!
- Quickly, quickly

41
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,933
Come, let me show you to your room

42
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:48,921
Look at yourself. Your head, ears, 
body, feet - are all filthy!

43
00:04:51,077 --> 00:04:54,696
I want you to go have a bath
- Alright, auntie

44
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:13,508
Hey, who is in there?! Come out now!

45
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:18,990
It's me, Hassan. Your father
asked me to bathe. Why?

46
00:05:19,246 --> 00:05:23,924
Get out now! You used
my towel and soap, huh?!

47
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:26,519
Hurry! Minah!

48
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:30,283
Who is this? Your father brought
him and asked him to bathe

49
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,044
Give me my shirt back, now!

50
00:05:32,446 --> 00:05:36,685
Give me my shirt back! Aziz, enough!

51
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,732
No manners. Why are you siding him?

52
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:42,314
But he didn't do anything wrong.
- Then why did he take my shirt?

53
00:05:42,406 --> 00:05:47,997
Enough, Aziz. Enough!
- Get out, now!

54
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,088
Don't bother about him. Wear the shirt.

55
00:05:55,709 --> 00:06:01,630
What was all the shouting about 
in the kitchen?
- But I want to know who that boy is

56
00:06:01,813 --> 00:06:03,750
Sit!

57
00:06:04,846 --> 00:06:08,209
He is my adopted son. I do
not want you both fighting

58
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:10,647
And I want you to be nice to him

59
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:16,458
But he is a son of a servant! He is filthy.
He wore my shirt, pants - all my clothes!

60
00:06:16,568 --> 00:06:21,210
Why did you let him stay here?
- He is staying here which 
makes him your brother

61
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,865
That's all I want to know
- Hey, Aziz. Come back!

62
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:31,568
He stayed no more than an hour, and 
already my father's ring was missing.
Guess who stole it? That boy, of course

63
00:06:31,712 --> 00:06:35,734
What's his name?
- Hassan

64
00:06:35,735 --> 00:06:41,247
One day I'll teach him a lesson. If
you don't like him, I hate him also

65
00:06:41,394 --> 00:06:45,670
That Hassan is filthy liar and a thief

66
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:48,996
Hey Aziz, enough of your
lies! Come home with me now!

67
00:06:49,105 --> 00:06:51,737
If you want me, catch me first

68
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:56,739
Everything I said is
true. He is the liar.

69
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:11,965
Why are you following us? I don't
like you both following us around

70
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:15,218
I am not following you.
I'm heading to school

71
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,192
Aziz is the one following you, not me

72
00:07:17,338 --> 00:07:19,640
I don't like walking near both of you

73
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,661
Hassan, hold on. Let us walk together
- Come along then

74
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:34,282
Look at that Hassan.
He thinks he is so good.

75
00:07:34,428 --> 00:07:38,046
Did you know what he said? He
said he could beat you anytime

76
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:39,947
Is it true he said that?
- Of course

77
00:07:40,057 --> 00:07:45,137
Alright. I'm going to wait for him here
after school. Let us see who wins or loses.

78
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:08,524
Hassan, stop there

79
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,009
Salmah, go home!
- What are you doing?

80
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:13,202
None of your business. Get lost!

81
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:15,688
What do you want?

82
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:19,087
Is it true you wanted to teach 
me a lesson yesterday?
- No, I never said that

83
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:23,874
Yesterday you said, you could 
win with your hands tied
- No, I didn't say that

84
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:27,018
Then are you trying to say 
my friend is a liar?
- I don't know

85
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:30,307
If you want to fight, come on then
- Why should I fight, 
when you did me no wrong

86
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:32,609
I must fight with you
- I don't want to fight

87
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,785
If I threw your 'songkok' down?

88
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:39,061
I pick it up

89
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:41,327
If I threw your book down?

90
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:46,114
I pick it up

91
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:52,693
May I go back now?
- Go back? You fight with me first

92
00:08:54,338 --> 00:08:56,348
Wallop him. Whack him

93
00:09:05,157 --> 00:09:08,044
Hit him, Hassan. Hit him!

94
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:11,297
Punch him. Don't be afraid. Punch him!

95
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,633
Aziz, I shall tell your
father you caused this fight

96
00:09:16,743 --> 00:09:19,301
If you don't stop fighting,
I shall tell father

97
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,000
I keep telling don't fight but you still do
- It's not my fault 
Then whose fault is it?

98
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:31,289
Peace be with you
- Peace be also with you

99
00:09:31,428 --> 00:09:37,458
Actually, I have come here to ask if he
was in a fight with Buang this morning?

100
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,465
Perhaps so, but Aziz and
Buang often disturb him

101
00:09:43,196 --> 00:09:48,057
One day I saw them wielding a knife
- A knife?!

102
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:52,333
So, you can't blame Hassan

103
00:09:53,247 --> 00:09:54,746
It's true, Uncle!

104
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:59,424
If you want me to confront 
both Aziz and Buang
- I am not afraid to do so

105
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:01,507
Hassan is not in the wrong

106
00:10:01,653 --> 00:10:04,906
Why are you smiling? Glad
that she is bailing you out?

107
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:08,433
My apologies, teacher. I will go now

108
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,161
Uncle will go now, alright? Let's go

109
00:10:17,497 --> 00:10:20,640
Salmah, come read

110
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:27,876
Hassan is good
- Yes, he is

111
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:47,412
Why did you tell on me to my father?
- I didn't. Salmah did.

112
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,560
Hassan, don't act so big
in this house. I hate you!

113
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,912
I hate you right from the tip of your hair
to the ends of your feet, do you know that?

114
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:08,638
Treacherous child! Go to your room! Go!

115
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,147
It's alright now. 
Don't be bothered about him

116
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:37,434
Study well

117
00:12:05,764 --> 00:12:15,527
Tunggu sekejap wahai kawan (/kanda)
Wait for awhile, my friend (/love)

118
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:22,383
Kerana hujan masih renyai
Because the rain is still falling

119
00:12:22,532 --> 00:12:27,906
Tunggu sekejap 
Wait awhile

120
00:12:28,105 --> 00:12:35,619
Dalam pelukan asmara ku 
In my passionate embrace 
(verse not sung)

121
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:55,434
Jangan bimbang 
Do not worry 
(verse not sung)

122
00:12:55,682 --> 00:13:07,177
Walaupun siang akan menjelma 
Even if morning dawns 
(verse not sung)

123
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:12,937
Malam ini 
This night

124
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:21,977
Belum puas ku bercumbu dengan kanda 
I haven't caressed you enough

125
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:28,415
Sayang 
What a shame

126
00:13:28,804 --> 00:13:40,102
Tunggu sekejap wahai kasih
Wait for awhile, my love

127
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:47,603
Tunggulah sampai hujan teduh
Wait till the rain stops falling

128
00:13:47,846 --> 00:13:52,705
Mari ku dendang
Let me sing to you

129
00:13:53,069 --> 00:14:03,274
Jangan mengenang orang jauh
Don't think of someone else

130
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,955
Jangan pula
Please don't

131
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:20,524
Jangan tinggalkan daku sorang 
Don't leave me alone

132
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:32,794
Tunggu sekejap kasih 
Wait awhile, love

133
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:45,063
Tunggu Wait

134
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:57,672
Hey, what are you guys doing here?
- Have a seat

135
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:01,560
Why aren't you drinking this coffee
- Who is going to pay?

136
00:15:01,803 --> 00:15:06,055
Whatever you want, I'll pay
- You still haven't settled the last tab!

137
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:16,259
Still trying to tackle Salmah?
- Yes

138
00:15:20,268 --> 00:15:26,463
Do you know, I'll be marrying her soon.
My father has met with her father.

139
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:28,935
Sure I'll have her.
Who doesn't know, Aziz?

140
00:15:31,642 --> 00:15:34,229
Then what about Hassan?
- Who? Hassan?

141
00:15:34,703 --> 00:15:39,529
You mean my step-brother? 
Believe me, he doesn't stand a chance

142
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,877
You're serious?

143
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,518
Yes, when I get married
- I'll invite all of you

144
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:57,325
Go ahead. I really want to know if 
Salmah truly likes you
- I'm feeling shy

145
00:15:57,366 --> 00:16:03,399
You're all talk. If she really likes you, 
go ahead and call her. 
- Yeah, Aziz. If you're slow, 
your step-brother might beat you to it

146
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:09,410
Hey, he is not my brother
- If you're correct you can whack this fellow
Let's go then

147
00:16:09,491 --> 00:16:11,590
Aziz is a real coward

148
00:16:14,504 --> 00:16:17,602
She has a voice of a male

149
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,230
Uncle?
- Who's that?

150
00:16:21,882 --> 00:16:23,186
Aziz, sir

151
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:25,020
Where's Salmah?
- She's asleep

152
00:16:25,163 --> 00:16:26,406
Aziz here wants to see her

153
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:29,259
Slept in the daytime
- It is already late at night

154
00:16:29,382 --> 00:16:31,542
Can we come in, uncle?
- Maybe another night

155
00:16:31,603 --> 00:16:35,251
Oh come on, uncle.

156
00:16:35,455 --> 00:16:38,471
Enough of making noise in the
middle of the night. Just go home

157
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:41,161
Hey Hassan, don't get involved.
This is none of your business

158
00:16:41,426 --> 00:16:43,831
Yes, it's true it's none of my business

159
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:46,583
But, what about the neighbour next door?

160
00:16:46,644 --> 00:16:50,888
You better move along, if
you do not want any trouble

161
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:56,381
The whole village knows you guys 
are strong and is scared of all of you. 
Even I am scared.

162
00:17:04,104 --> 00:17:11,548
Uncle, looks like you have a guard. 
I'll let father know you have a new job 
as a guard

163
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,891
You haven't slept yet?
- No, I haven't

164
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:26,752
Come here for awhile

165
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:34,793
I heard everything
- You did? Oh right, you weren't asleep

166
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:39,371
Is that all you're going to say to them?
- To whom?

167
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:44,944
To those fellows just now
- What else could I say?

168
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:51,498
Don't you have any feelings?
- Yes, I did feel a little insulted that's all

169
00:17:51,577 --> 00:17:56,314
But why didn't you
express those feelings?

170
00:17:56,513 --> 00:18:01,648
Sometimes we need to. 
Sometimes we don't

171
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:06,783
But I've always seen you around 
my house. Is there something you 
wish to tell me?

172
00:18:06,943 --> 00:18:13,192
Yes, in the morning I did. 
But now I don't

173
00:18:13,312 --> 00:18:15,740
Wait for awhile

174
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:29,676
On a quiet night like
this, do you feel anything?

175
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:34,840
I feel a bit warm
- Warm?!

176
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:42,136
I feel my hot above, but cold below
- That's because you're sitting on water

177
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:47,881
I'm tired speaking with you. Good night

178
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,600
Now you want to talk to me?

179
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,593
Will you get angry if I said something?
- No, I won't

180
00:19:02,713 --> 00:19:06,304
Sure? - I'm sure
You swear? - I swear

181
00:19:09,057 --> 00:19:13,665
When you left just now, you
forgot to blow out the lamp

182
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:47,823
The Royal Malay Regiment is recruiting!

183
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:55,139
This is a great opportunity. I want to join! 
I want to join the Malay Regiment! 
Later, I'll go tell my father

184
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:04,844
Father! Father!

185
00:20:07,943 --> 00:20:10,689
Father, have you read today's newspaper?
- Not yet. Why?

186
00:20:12,922 --> 00:20:16,139
The Royal Malay Regiment is recruiting

187
00:20:18,374 --> 00:20:20,532
May I join the Army, father?

188
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:28,080
Yes, I give you my blessings

189
00:20:28,688 --> 00:20:31,708
Hey you cowards! When are
you going to be soldiers?

190
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:35,905
All of you have no guts!

191
00:20:37,188 --> 00:20:39,275
Minah, what did he say?

192
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,923
He wants to become a soldier

193
00:20:42,014 --> 00:20:46,006
To tell you honestly, Aziz
cannot become a soldier

194
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:49,449
Whereas Hassan can
really become a soldier

195
00:20:49,501 --> 00:20:52,084
Because he is fat and stronger
(has more meat on his bones) 

196
00:20:52,188 --> 00:20:54,288
You think Aziz isn't strong?

197
00:20:55,971 --> 00:20:58,684
He is like a thin blade
of the 'lalang' weed

198
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,053
I can pull him out from
the ground very easily

199
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,223
You guys are talking
nonsense. Where's your rifle?

200
00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:10,684
Aiyah, Minah. If you don't
believe me, then just watch

201
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:16,005
Father, is it true what he is saying?

202
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:19,123
Please give me your
permission to join the Army

203
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:24,079
I would rather you stayed
here at home to help me

204
00:21:31,903 --> 00:21:32,873
I'm going back now

205
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:43,741
What your father say is true

206
00:21:44,197 --> 00:21:48,757
If you become a soldier and Aziz 
becomes a soldier, who would 
take care of your father?

207
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,373
Don't feel sad about it. 
I'm going back now

208
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:01,197
... those fellows are disturbing ...

209
00:22:01,231 --> 00:22:04,687
Don't forget to send letters or news

210
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:08,661
About the situation in the Malay Regiment
- Alright, father

211
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:12,065
And if there is anything
you want, please tell me

212
00:22:16,141 --> 00:22:18,294
Here is forty ringgit

213
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:21,493
Later I'll send more
- Thank you, father

214
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:24,550
Hurry and get ready. Your
friends are waiting at the station

215
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:27,586
Minah, he is leaving tonight?

216
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:30,948
Yes, he is leaving tonight by train

217
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:34,596
What a shame. Wouldn't it
be good if I could go too?

218
00:22:34,698 --> 00:22:38,183
What ever for?
- To become a soldier, of course

219
00:22:38,652 --> 00:22:41,872
Not everyone wants to become a soldier.
Whoever wishes to do so can become one

220
00:22:42,115 --> 00:22:47,435
But you know the person in this house, 
wishes Aziz to go instead of me. 
I should go first, isn't that right?

221
00:22:47,475 --> 00:22:49,758
I'd much prefer you being here instead

222
00:22:52,306 --> 00:22:54,486
Where are you, Minah?
- Here, sir

223
00:23:00,782 --> 00:23:02,555
The pants are still wet, sir

224
00:23:03,288 --> 00:23:08,342
Do you expect me to bring 
this to Port Dickson? 
Why didn't you wash it yesterday?

225
00:23:08,444 --> 00:23:11,970
I was only told this morning to wash it
- Yes, I told her to

226
00:23:12,235 --> 00:23:14,395
Ah, I don't want this

227
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:18,677
I can do it by myself, don't bother

228
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,241
I'm going now

229
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,889
Father, are you following me to the station?
- Yes, I will be seeing you off

230
00:23:35,951 --> 00:23:38,580
Safe journey, Aziz
- Whatever

231
00:23:38,723 --> 00:23:43,532
When I'm gone, don't forget to ask
Hassan to help Minah in the kitchen

232
00:23:44,897 --> 00:23:46,548
See you at the station, father

233
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:49,992
Aziz, you are always joking around

234
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,969
He wasn't joking
- What?

235
00:23:53,253 --> 00:23:54,964
Actually, I am ashamed of living here

236
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:58,816
I want to go along with 
Aziz to become a soldier
- What are you ashamed of?

237
00:23:59,183 --> 00:24:02,566
You have to stay here
to help me in the field

238
00:24:02,627 --> 00:24:05,684
But...
- Enough. That is my decision

239
00:24:05,723 --> 00:24:07,659
Don't think of the matter anymore

240
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,732
Don't forget to send us letters

241
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:19,871
I won't forget. I'll send you letters

242
00:24:21,053 --> 00:24:23,478
How do you do, sir

243
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:28,919
You're not here to say farewell?
- That is the reason I am here,
to wish you a safe journey

244
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:34,809
If that is true, give me that flower
as a symbol of remembrance
- Alright

245
00:24:34,991 --> 00:24:40,493
As you head for this long journey,
take this flower to remember me by
- Thank you, Salmah

246
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:45,283
Friends, I shall go now
as the country beckons me

247
00:24:49,024 --> 00:24:52,872
Don't forget, please watch over 
your friend over there...
- Who's that?

248
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:54,176
That coward

249
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:58,562
Goodbye. Goodbye, Salmah

250
00:25:02,443 --> 00:25:06,242
Goodbye, Father
- Goodbye, Aziz

251
00:25:06,307 --> 00:25:07,318
Safe journey, Aziz

252
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:09,633
Take good care of yourself
- Alright, father

253
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:18,549
Alright friends, remember
to watch over that coward

254
00:25:56,977 --> 00:26:01,224
(Hassan is a coward, quite unlike Aziz)

255
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:04,500
Don't get angry about something true

256
00:26:25,058 --> 00:26:31,737
(...Hassan the coward...)

257
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:38,703
(...When I'm gone, don't forget to ask
Hassan to help Minah in the kitchen...)

258
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:49,676
(...Hey friends...)

259
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:53,976
(...Don't forget to
watch over that coward...)

260
00:27:14,753 --> 00:27:19,809
What are you writing, Hassan?
- Nothing

261
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:24,466
What are you writing there?
- Nothing. Why aren't you asleep yet, Minah?

262
00:27:24,546 --> 00:27:28,646
How am I going to sleep?
Been waiting for you to return

263
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:33,700
So what are you doing?
- Nothing important. Just a letter

264
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:37,163
I can figure it out
- What?

265
00:27:37,203 --> 00:27:39,751
You are leaving us, aren't you?

266
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:45,921
What nonsense. I can't do anything

267
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:51,134
Anyway, how would you know 
what I'm really thinking about? 
Is it written on my face?

268
00:27:51,851 --> 00:27:55,314
I've taken care of you since a child

269
00:27:55,394 --> 00:27:58,260
I know everything about you

270
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:03,514
Alright, then what was I writing about?
- You want to become a soldier

271
00:28:04,747 --> 00:28:08,449
Shh... don't speak so loudly

272
00:28:09,126 --> 00:28:14,062
Yes, Minah. It's true
I want to join the Army

273
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:18,003
You are not angry, are you?
- No I'm not. That's because I already knew

274
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:25,964
That's why I have already packed 
everything here for you. 
Soap, money, handkerchief ...

275
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:28,749
You already knew I was going
- Of course!

276
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:34,402
Now hurry and finish writing your letter.
I'll give to your father tomorrow morning. 
I've got to go
- Where are you going?

277
00:28:34,521 --> 00:28:39,935
That's my own business. You keep quiet

278
00:28:40,054 --> 00:28:43,000
Minah. Thank you.

279
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:59,073
Who is that?
- Minah

280
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:04,407
Is there anything,
especially at this hour?

281
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,104
Hassan is running away from home

282
00:29:11,055 --> 00:29:16,190
Where is he going? He is going to
Port Dickson, to become a soldier

283
00:29:18,418 --> 00:29:23,195
Did he request for anything?
- Nothing

284
00:29:26,817 --> 00:29:29,763
Thank you, Minah

285
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,574
Here's some food
- I have enough here

286
00:29:35,693 --> 00:29:39,515
Yes I know, but you will be travelling far. 
So eat more it is alright

287
00:29:42,438 --> 00:29:46,976
If I go, I will miss your cooking

288
00:29:47,055 --> 00:29:50,916
That is alright. When you
return, I can cook for you again

289
00:29:52,469 --> 00:29:55,136
Where's that letter of yours?

290
00:29:57,246 --> 00:29:59,754
Please give this to father
- Alright

291
00:30:01,704 --> 00:30:03,774
I'll go now

292
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:32,935
I want to talk to you

293
00:30:33,055 --> 00:30:36,319
What are you doing here, so early?
- Minah told me you were leaving

294
00:30:36,757 --> 00:30:39,822
Is that all?
- No

295
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:44,678
I want to personally
wish you a safe journey

296
00:30:45,634 --> 00:30:49,415
Just like how you said
farewell to Aziz, isn't it?

297
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:53,793
I know that you are in love with Aziz
- No, I'm not

298
00:30:55,067 --> 00:31:03,307
I went there to say farewell to you, 
thinking you were the one becoming 
the soldier. Instead it was Aziz.

299
00:31:03,386 --> 00:31:06,611
Now I feel so happy

300
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:11,069
But I also feel sad

301
00:31:11,108 --> 00:31:13,775
Why are you sad?

302
00:31:13,894 --> 00:31:16,322
Because...

303
00:31:16,521 --> 00:31:20,184
Don't you feel the same way as I do?

304
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:26,752
Yes, Salmah. Actually, I felt
that same way since a long time ago

305
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:33,001
At the same time, I
felt unworthy to anyone

306
00:31:33,318 --> 00:31:38,453
Now is the time to
prove yourself, Hassan

307
00:31:38,652 --> 00:31:44,066
But I'd rather those words
are spoken from your lips

308
00:31:46,534 --> 00:31:57,481
If all this time my eyes have said so,
let my lips now tell you that 'I love you'

309
00:31:57,656 --> 00:31:59,631
I feel so happy

310
00:32:02,623 --> 00:32:05,975
Take this to remember me by

311
00:32:06,094 --> 00:32:11,960
If you are in need of help, send
me this ring so that I will know

312
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:18,663
The bus is arriving. Goodbye, Salmah
- Goodbye, Hassan. Think of me

313
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:46,170
This shot isn't too good. But the 
second shot was good. Understand?
- Understood

314
00:34:46,521 --> 00:34:58,211
All the shots within this bold circle 
constitutes 25 points. Which is great. 
Understand?
- Yes, sir. I understand

315
00:35:35,037 --> 00:35:40,648
How much is this?
- That's one ringgit twenty cents, sir

316
00:36:01,262 --> 00:36:03,039
Is ninety cents alright?
- No

317
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:09,398
But all I have is ninety cents
- I can sell it to you at one ringgit, 
if that is alright?

318
00:36:09,492 --> 00:36:13,509
One ringgit? But I just have ninety cents. 
Never mind, I'll come again tomorrow

319
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:18,244
Just buy it

320
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:22,744
I don't have enough money, Sergeant
- I'll pay

321
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:24,958
No, it's alright, sir
- I'll pay, don't worry about it

322
00:36:25,037 --> 00:36:25,963
Thank you, sir

323
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,706
The blue one
- Alright

324
00:36:31,952 --> 00:36:37,277
Is it pretty like your fiance?
- To me she is pretty, Sergeant

325
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:42,601
I'll pay you later...
- No, it's alright. It's alright

326
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:44,741
You do not need to pay me back

327
00:36:44,818 --> 00:36:48,714
Thank you, sir
- You're welcome. 
I really like you that's why

328
00:36:48,791 --> 00:36:53,733
I shall not forget this
- It's really alright. You are really 
a hardworking person

329
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:55,389
Thank you, sir

330
00:37:01,397 --> 00:37:06,161
This shawl is beautiful.
So beautiful, Minah

331
00:37:06,288 --> 00:37:11,358
The one you wore the other 
day is much better
- But it is not the same as this one

332
00:37:11,536 --> 00:37:14,364
I know what you mean

333
00:37:14,822 --> 00:37:19,459
If it comes from someone you
like, it is definitely pretty

334
00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:26,005
If your father asks, you just say 
I bought it for you - Not as if a woman 
would give another woman a shawl

335
00:37:26,565 --> 00:37:29,954
I want to show you the picture again

336
00:37:31,228 --> 00:37:33,903
So elegant. Don't you
think so too, Minah?

337
00:37:34,132 --> 00:37:37,877
Why are you showing it to me for?
I've taken care of him since a child

338
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:46,309
Don't sulk. He is really
handsome and elegant

339
00:37:46,385 --> 00:37:51,480
You're so kind hearted, Minah. But why
doesn't my hands meet when I hug you?

340
00:37:51,684 --> 00:37:56,117
You are always kidding
around. I have to go now

341
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,548
When will you return to me?

342
00:38:08,613 --> 00:38:17,622
Tunggu sekejap wahai kasih
Wait for awhile, my love

343
00:38:17,661 --> 00:38:25,141
Kerana hujan masih renyai
Because the rain is still falling

344
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:30,561
Tunggu sekejap 
Wait awhile

345
00:38:30,629 --> 00:38:36,457
Dalam pelukan asmara ku
In my passionate embrace

346
00:38:41,297 --> 00:38:45,373
Jangan bimbang 
Do not worry

347
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:54,035
Walaupun siang akan menjelma
Even if morning dawns

348
00:38:55,405 --> 00:39:00,500
Malam ini 
This night

349
00:39:00,531 --> 00:39:14,448
Belum puas ku bercumbu dengan dinda 
I haven't caressed you enough

350
00:39:15,434 --> 00:39:24,764
Tunggu sekejap wahai kasih
Wait for awhile, my love

351
00:39:24,892 --> 00:39:31,164
Tunggulah sampai hujan teduh
Wait till the rain stops falling

352
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:36,228
Mari ku dendang 
Let me sing to you

353
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:45,399
Jangan mengenang orang jauh
Don't think of someone faraway

354
00:39:45,495 --> 00:39:51,323
Jangan pula 
Please don't

355
00:39:51,449 --> 00:40:00,175
Jangan tinggalkan daku sorang 
Don't leave me alone

356
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:08,103
Tunggu sekejap kasih 
Wait awhile, love

357
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:14,823
Tunggu 
Wait

358
00:40:21,095 --> 00:40:24,567
You're the new person who has
obtained the Corporal rank
- Yes

359
00:40:24,757 --> 00:40:27,719
I will try my best to add another stripe

360
00:40:27,814 --> 00:40:33,133
And if you get three?
- I might. Who knows?

361
00:40:50,956 --> 00:40:53,949
You have been promoted to full
Corporal. That is really great!

362
00:40:54,045 --> 00:41:00,064
I know you helped me there
- I really do believe in you, 
being a full Corporal

363
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:03,312
Thank you, Sergeant
- You are welcome

364
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,558
All the best to you
- Thank you, Sergeant

365
00:41:30,602 --> 00:41:35,315
Who told you to Stand Ea-Sy? 
I said Stand at Ease. 
Do you understand 'Stand at Ease'?

366
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:38,312
How long have you been here that
you still don't know the difference?

367
00:41:38,414 --> 00:41:41,980
If you are not qualified to be a soldier. 
Why don't you return to your village 
and plant sweet potatoes?

368
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:45,567
Stand properly! Hoi, look in front!

369
00:41:50,534 --> 00:41:52,878
What are you laughing at?

370
00:42:12,482 --> 00:42:17,841
Thank you so much
- It's alright, we cooked quite a bit

371
00:42:18,106 --> 00:42:19,655
We interrupt this programme...

372
00:42:19,716 --> 00:42:22,427
The Japanese Air Force
have bombed Pearl Harbour

373
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:24,750
The American fort in the Pacific

374
00:42:24,847 --> 00:42:26,765
A lot of damage was caused

375
00:42:26,895 --> 00:42:28,434
The American Navy is now...

376
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:29,399
Pearl Harbour has been bombed?!

377
00:42:59,178 --> 00:43:02,204
The Japanese airplanes
have bombed Singapore

378
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:38,077
And this is the final news. The Japanese
army have landed in Kota Bharu (Malaya)

379
00:43:38,133 --> 00:43:40,840
The Japanese have landed in Kota Bharu?

380
00:43:40,872 --> 00:43:44,231
Yes. The Japanese have
landed in Kota Bharu

381
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:51,209
Listen here, my fellow soldiers. Eat up. 
Then we shall all head to the jungle

382
00:45:00,396 --> 00:45:04,361
The Japanese are in Kajang now
- Yeah?

383
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:18,278
The Japs are approaching nearer and 
nearer, sir. They are somewhere 
in Kajang now   - Okay, Hassan

384
00:45:45,645 --> 00:45:48,832
Sergeant, twenty
Japanese are approaching

385
00:45:58,726 --> 00:46:02,599
Sentry, boss. Twenty Japanese 
approaching, sir
- Twenty Japanese?

386
00:46:02,675 --> 00:46:07,676
That makes us about even. 
Right, get the men to stand two.
Pass the word, "Fire when ready"
- Right, sir

387
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,492
Put it out. Put it out

388
00:46:28,905 --> 00:46:31,840
Cover that track

389
00:46:35,075 --> 00:46:37,065
Quickly!

390
00:46:39,105 --> 00:46:42,393
Pon, twenty Japanese are
approaching. Stand two.

391
00:46:44,832 --> 00:46:48,888
What do you think? Can we win?
- Aren't I here, how can we lose?

392
00:49:04,907 --> 00:49:08,484
Get them all back!

393
00:49:40,874 --> 00:49:44,593
Who is there? Halt

394
00:50:13,554 --> 00:50:20,260
I hope the Japanese didn't follow us
- Not many are familiar with this area, sir
That's good

395
00:50:27,743 --> 00:50:34,546
I didn't think I'd see you again, Aziz
- Just ask the Lieutenant

396
00:50:34,643 --> 00:50:42,418
Where are the rest of your fellows?
- They aren't able to come

397
00:50:42,612 --> 00:50:49,221
They have all perished
in the battlefield

398
00:50:49,609 --> 00:50:57,384
Food is ready. Go eat
- Thank you, Aziz
No problem

399
00:51:00,687 --> 00:51:06,033
I was told that there is a Japanese lorry
no more than two miles from here
- Is that true, Aziz?

400
00:51:06,572 --> 00:51:10,980
Yes, sir. But I told them earlier but they
didn't listen to me. So just forget about it

401
00:51:11,031 --> 00:51:14,979
Why should we forget it, Aziz? 
If that will give us an advantage, 
why should we forget about it?

402
00:51:15,056 --> 00:51:20,278
I don't have any power. I'm not a Sergeant
- What has it got to do with being 
a Sergeant? You are making excuses

403
00:51:20,481 --> 00:51:27,334
Hassan, sit down. Sit down. Tell us about it, Aziz
- Yes, sir. I shall tell about it if you wish to hear

404
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:31,563
Two miles from here is a Japanese
lorry. It has been there for four days

405
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:34,849
I've seen it, sir. There are a lot
of weapons and food supplies in there

406
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:37,193
I think it is best if we go for it, sir

407
00:51:37,653 --> 00:51:40,761
When? Tonight. Everyone should go

408
00:51:40,786 --> 00:51:44,964
Yes, we all go. If we sent one person, 
even I would be afraid. Whosoever 
does not wish to go, can stay behind

409
00:51:45,117 --> 00:51:47,028
It is not that I do not want to go, Aziz

410
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:50,034
But the lorry has been there
for four days, for what purpose?

411
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:51,899
What if it is a trap?

412
00:51:52,903 --> 00:51:57,432
Don't you know, the most useful human 
being is one uses less of this (talk) 
and more of this (action)?

413
00:51:58,404 --> 00:51:59,090
So how, sir?

414
00:52:00,144 --> 00:52:02,351
Sounds good. What do you think, Hassan?

415
00:52:05,464 --> 00:52:08,137
It is a trap. A trap.

416
00:52:10,615 --> 00:52:14,439
Want to go?
- Yes, sir

417
00:52:14,587 --> 00:52:16,744
Alright, we move

418
00:52:23,632 --> 00:52:26,377
Hassan, how then?

419
00:52:30,545 --> 00:52:35,081
If everyone is going. I'm going too
- If you're going, then it will be fun

420
00:52:37,383 --> 00:52:38,805
Alright, Pon

421
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:10,468
That's the lorry, sir
- What is in there?

422
00:53:10,692 --> 00:53:14,209
If you want to know, let me go find out
- No, don't go

423
00:53:14,433 --> 00:53:19,820
They might be leaving that as a bait for us
- I don't need to listen to your advice.
Let me go ahead, sir

424
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:25,057
Sure, but go with caution
- Alright, sir

425
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:48,473
Come back, Aziz! Come back!

426
00:54:49,896 --> 00:54:56,105
Aziz, get up. Get up!
- Why did you return? I don't need 
your help. It is better if you leave!

427
00:54:56,255 --> 00:55:00,819
I don't want anything happening to you
- You better get away before 
the Japanese capture you

428
00:55:01,118 --> 00:55:06,729
I've already thought it over. 
Now get up! Get up!

429
00:55:29,097 --> 00:55:34,110
What's wrong? Get up
- My feet hurts

430
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:38,599
Just leave alone me here.
I'd much prefer to die here

431
00:55:38,674 --> 00:55:45,033
I don't want to owe anyone, least to you
- Enough, you're talking too much

432
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:55,433
I'm still saving you. Sorry, yeah.
We'll head over there for safety

433
00:57:52,663 --> 00:57:57,526
Open the door

434
00:58:08,937 --> 00:58:11,106
What you want?

435
00:58:11,256 --> 00:58:14,697
My name is Buang, master. 
I know everything about the village

436
00:58:14,997 --> 00:58:18,214
I can tell who is good or bad, master

437
00:58:18,438 --> 00:58:20,982
That is great

438
00:58:21,132 --> 00:58:25,537
Buang, why don't you work for me?
Become a Kempeitai
(Japanese military police)

439
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:28,146
Ok, master. I like that

440
00:58:30,421 --> 00:58:33,657
(Take care of this new recruit)

441
00:58:33,853 --> 00:58:37,344
Go and change into your new clothes

442
00:58:39,204 --> 00:58:45,284
Go tell the village folks that
no one is to play the radio

443
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:49,991
If anyone plays the radio,
will be sent to Malacca for...

444
00:58:50,062 --> 00:58:52,180
... their heads to be chopped off!

445
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:54,122
Alright, master

446
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,436
Master, is my rank high?

447
00:58:56,554 --> 00:59:00,241
Oh, big. Very big just like me

448
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:40,132
Lieutenant, do we have some gauss?

449
00:59:47,656 --> 00:59:49,691
What are you up to?

450
00:59:49,813 --> 00:59:53,393
Gauss. For him. Okay?

451
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:18,169
I'll try and make it

452
01:00:18,218 --> 01:00:22,312
You mad? You'll be shot before a yard

453
01:00:23,904 --> 01:00:25,890
It is a chance I have to take

454
01:00:27,361 --> 01:00:29,837
Somebody must call for help

455
01:00:30,964 --> 01:00:34,911
There is nothing around
here, sir. Except grass

456
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:39,837
And we die like rats
- I'll look after the boys

457
01:00:40,009 --> 01:00:45,084
And whoever you meet.
Tell them we are carrying on
- Very well, sir

458
01:00:49,299 --> 01:00:52,928
Please take care of Aziz for me.
And tell him we will meet again

459
01:00:53,124 --> 01:00:55,011
I'll be back

460
01:00:56,286 --> 01:00:58,468
Thank you, sir
- Good luck

461
01:01:06,091 --> 01:01:09,694
Gauss. Finished. Okay?

462
01:02:18,369 --> 01:02:22,571
Hurry! Hurry!

463
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:34,261
Over there!

464
01:02:40,103 --> 01:02:41,794
Who is that?

465
01:02:46,403 --> 01:02:49,321
It is best if you just married me

466
01:02:49,392 --> 01:02:53,560
I want you to wait here. Hassan is dead
