1
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:22,046
Payments of foreign
loans are cancelled.

2
00:00:22,327 --> 00:00:24,646
No more liras will be
paid to international...

3
00:00:24,647 --> 00:00:29,686
financial monopolies, which impoverished
our country for years and...

4
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:32,326
which seized our people's bread.

5
00:00:32,607 --> 00:00:35,527
Turkish bureau of IMF, which is the

6
00:00:35,528 --> 00:00:38,446
pawnshop of imperialism,
is closed and...

7
00:00:38,447 --> 00:00:41,962
all agreements with it are
cancelled unilaterally.

8
00:00:42,047 --> 00:00:46,166
The budget of foreign loans, promised
by previous governments to...

9
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:49,102
imperialist countries,
will be spent for

10
00:00:49,103 --> 00:00:52,037
education and health
needs of our people.

11
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:55,045
Two: Internal loans are cancelled.

12
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,236
You see, they have already started!

13
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:04,120
So?
Should they wait?

14
00:01:06,127 --> 00:01:11,679
They have the chance,
they will stop at nothing!

15
00:01:11,887 --> 00:01:16,005
The loans that the state borrowed from
leading capitalists with heavy interest.

16
00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:19,886
I don't understand!
We established factories.

17
00:01:19,887 --> 00:01:23,675
We employed people.
We fed them.

18
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,483
Now they walk all over us.

19
00:01:29,527 --> 00:01:35,397
I really don't understand;
What is happening to this country.

20
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,759
You don't understand what, Necla?
What you don't understand?

21
00:01:43,487 --> 00:01:46,445
So, these raiders
will govern the country?

22
00:01:46,887 --> 00:01:51,802
They lose their ways on straight line.

23
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:57,756
Now, we are leaving everything
we have to this crowd...

24
00:01:58,207 --> 00:01:59,845
How nice!

25
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:04,365
I surely always
appreciate your ideas!

26
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:11,955
If you want you can stay here,
I don't force you to come with me!

27
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:26,676
Can you shut down this,
this is enough!

28
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:30,922
I can't! If you want get off,
take another taxi.

29
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:34,682
Mines, foreign trade institutions
and banks are nationalized.

30
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:38,163
The economic system
based on exploitation of...

31
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:42,439
by people will be removed
entirely according to a plan...

32
00:02:42,807 --> 00:02:47,642
; the economic roots of inequality
and injustice will be eradicated.

33
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:53,239
Seven: A major plan will be prepared
for the solution of housing problem.

34
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:57,684
Everyone is owner of the house he
lives in until this plan is announced.

35
00:02:57,807 --> 00:03:01,163
People living in houses improper
to health and dignity of human being...

36
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:04,325
will move to new houses
in the one-year period.

37
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:10,121
Work for years, strive, save;
Not go and leave everything to these.

38
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:13,680
Fine!
How nice!

39
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:19,602
We did everything for this country...
We sacrificed...

40
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:24,195
Now look at us...
We escape like criminals.

41
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:29,516
So, what should we do?
Say, what should we do?

42
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:32,641
Should we stay and wait
for they come and put us in jail?

43
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:38,086
But, what did we do?
Whay should they put us in jail.

44
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:40,125
I cannot understand
what we have done.

45
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,117
We gave everything
we have to this country...

46
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:45,603
and now look what we are faced with!

47
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:51,243
Better! You gave, got, done, finished!
We are going now.

48
00:03:53,327 --> 00:03:55,966
I still do not understand anything.

49
00:03:56,527 --> 00:04:00,725
How can we leave ourwealth
to these communists...

50
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:04,603
we pinched and saved
this wealth for years!

51
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:11,085
I really cannot understand
how all these happened!

52
00:04:11,247 --> 00:04:15,160
Necla it's enough, shut up!
Please, enough!

53
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:18,445
Eeeh! That is enough!
Get out!

54
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,382
What?

55
00:04:22,383 --> 00:04:24,156
Get out! I cannot deal
with you at this time!

56
00:04:24,527 --> 00:04:28,645
Well, but how can we get out?
The car is moving; you should stop.

57
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:33,046
The carwill continue,
it would not stop...

58
00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:36,722
but you will get out!

59
00:04:41,607 --> 00:04:46,158
Provisions for deresing the weekly...

60
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:50,481
working period to
35 hours at first...

61
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:53,644
then to 30 hours.

62
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:31,084
Erhan, get one and light up.

63
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:34,882
No, no brother, I will not smoke now.

64
00:05:37,847 --> 00:05:39,678
- Is there water in the car?
- Yes, here you are.

65
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:44,887
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

66
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:51,238
I want to say you
something but I'm afraid!

67
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:55,316
Why are you afraid?
What will you say?

68
00:05:56,087 --> 00:06:00,399
I'm afraid you'll do something
stupid and make me regret saying this.

69
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:05,684
Let us hearwhat it is.
What will you say?

70
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,840
- Promise me you won't turn mad.
- Of!

71
00:06:11,487 --> 00:06:13,682
- Say what you want to say.
- Promise me!

72
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:15,998
OK, I promise!
Promise!

73
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:20,796
I heard that her aunts will visit
Elif's family this evening.

74
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:25,915
So what?
They always visit them, no?

75
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,798
No, this time it's different.

76
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:32,837
I heard that they will make
Elif marry her cousin, Hüseyin.

77
00:06:33,327 --> 00:06:36,000
Elif's mother told this to my wife.

78
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:38,082
What are you talking about?

79
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:42,439
Mahmut Aga has been saying that he won't
give any part of his land to a stranger.

80
00:06:47,447 --> 00:06:50,120
- Where are you going?
- I have to find Elif.

81
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:39,801
Come, come, come, come!

82
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:46,441
- What?
- Open this window, open it!

83
00:07:47,687 --> 00:07:48,836
What happened?
What's this?

84
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:52,466
Will they come to ask for your
hand to marriage in the evening?

85
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:53,365
How should I know?

86
00:07:53,447 --> 00:07:55,283
Elif, what are you saying?

87
00:07:55,807 --> 00:07:57,923
What do you mean to do?
Are you insane?

88
00:07:58,247 --> 00:08:00,317
Do you want to marry your cousin?

89
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:02,444
I would marry you if you'v
e grown into a man!

90
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:04,598
I've had enough of this for years!

91
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:07,602
You said the factory is closed,
the construction went bankrupt...

92
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,397
My father has set his mind,
he will give me to Hüseyin.

93
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:15,505
Listen, either you
find a way and marry

94
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:17,843
me or go away and don't
come to me again!

95
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:21,079
Don't annoy me anymore!
I will live what's my destiny...

96
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,236
Leave me well alone!

97
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:25,805
Elif!

98
00:08:26,447 --> 00:08:27,800
God!

99
00:08:50,287 --> 00:08:52,596
- Selamun aleyküm, uncle Necmi.
- Aleyküm selam.

100
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:56,043
- Did you see brother Ömer?
- Which Ömer? The communist?

101
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:58,999
- Yes, communist Ömer. Did you see him?
- What is your job with him?

102
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:02,477
It is none of your business!
Tell me if you saw him or not!

103
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:05,917
He may be in the coffeehouse!
Look here! Why are you so angry?

104
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:10,482
God! Are you mad?
He resembles his father...

105
00:09:10,607 --> 00:09:14,077
They say this.
He found the old man, attacks steadily!

106
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:27,236
- Brother Ömer!
- What's up?

107
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:32,076
- I want to talk to you.
- Why?

108
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,763
Come here, I want to talk to you.

109
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:56,121
You said you will seize the
land of the bastard aga, no?

110
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:59,086
You said common farms would
be formed; people would...

111
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:01,317
work together produce together, no?
What happened?

112
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:04,564
These things are not so easy, brother.
The entire country is changing.

113
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:06,582
Also, why are you so
interested in this issue?

114
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,396
You were against this
collectivism before?

115
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:11,041
It's not your job!

116
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:14,557
Aren't you listening to me? You have
to finish this job until this evening!

117
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:18,765
Are you insane my boy?
This can't be solved so immediately.

118
00:10:18,927 --> 00:10:21,206
It must! It must be solved
in one day this time!

119
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:23,482
If not, I will be destroyed,
I will be spoiled!

120
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:27,601
- Why will you be destroyed?
- Look at me my Ömer! Brother Ömer!

121
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:30,600
I think you don't understand me, no?
Listen to me!

122
00:10:30,727 --> 00:10:32,365
I say we should lay our
hands on this issue

123
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:34,003
together and solve this issue today!

124
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:36,881
If so, go to the District
Agriculture Committee and say:

125
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:41,120
I reviled at the leftists until today,
now I am alarmed...

126
00:10:41,287 --> 00:10:44,643
- so I want collectivization.
- You say this?

127
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,001
- I actually say what you heard!
- Shit!

128
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:37,202
- Is it you who broke this window?
- Yes, I broke it, so? So what?

129
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:39,716
You said you will come to our village,
my friend; you didn't. Ha?

130
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:42,685
You said you would collectivize the
lands, you would form farms...

131
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:45,076
people would work together,
earn together! What happened?

132
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:47,922
- Are you maniac, my boy?
- What are you talking about?

133
00:11:48,127 --> 00:11:50,686
No one would be left landless;
Everybody would work and...

134
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:53,918
produce together blah blah,
Get you gone!

135
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,958
- We do that, don't you see?
- What do you do?

136
00:11:56,047 --> 00:11:59,278
Why didn't you come to our village, ha?
The same old same old!

137
00:11:59,447 --> 00:12:01,607
But this job is not so eay that
we can solve so soon!

138
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:03,165
This need a plan, a legal job...

139
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:05,204
We will come to your village
to when the time comes.

140
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:07,676
When will you come, when, when?

141
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,883
You will come when
I absolutely loose Elif, ha?

142
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:11,642
Who's Elif, my boy?

143
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:16,644
Her father in the evening, OK?
Will give her to her cousin only...

144
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:19,560
to protect his lands, OK,
her bastard father...

145
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,319
Come in, we will talk.

146
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,999
- Really?
- Come.

147
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:55,125
For your information,
I can't behave without thinkin...

148
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:57,906
I only attend to the meeting about

149
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:00,005
collectivization, that's it!
Do you understand?

150
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:03,285
God, OK brother,
OK, it's enough for me.

151
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:07,082
Look, if this man hears that
we will seize his land...

152
00:13:07,527 --> 00:13:11,126
he would forget his daughter,
the weeding, everything...

153
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:12,719
and he would head out
after you immediately!

154
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:16,119
What are you saying,
he is such a bastard!

155
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:19,480
- OK, let's see!
- Let's see.

156
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:40,725
Listen to me; should
I go and announce from the mosque...

157
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:42,718
so everyone will be gathered
in the coffeehouse?

158
00:13:42,927 --> 00:13:45,566
- OK. Do you know what you'll say?
- Certainly, I know.

159
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:47,485
- Let's see.
- Let's see.

160
00:13:54,487 --> 00:13:58,526
Dear people of Sakince village!

161
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:04,595
There will be a meeting in the
coffeehouse about the land...

162
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:08,687
collectivization in our village.

163
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:12,556
Everyone has to leave his job...

164
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:15,365
and come to the coffeehouse.

165
00:14:16,247 --> 00:14:19,478
Don't say "I didn't
hear, what will I do?"!

166
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:23,482
Immediately, quit your job and
come to the coffeehouse.

167
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:29,044
Especially, Mehmet Susuzgil
should come, it's a must!

168
00:14:31,967 --> 00:14:34,086
Friends, as you know,
the revolution...

169
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:37,716
aims a big transformation
in villages as well as in cities.

170
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:41,280
We have already seized
lands of land masters.

171
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:44,526
We form big farms on these lands.

172
00:14:45,327 --> 00:14:48,239
We invite small landholders like...

173
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,678
you to these common farms.

174
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:55,840
These farms will be
formed by your lands.

175
00:14:56,847 --> 00:14:58,963
I mean, your lands will
be combined; you will

176
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,079
cultivate the land together
and work together.

177
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:06,925
These farms will be
managed by managers...

178
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:10,882
you choose among yourself and
by expert agriculture engineers...

179
00:15:11,047 --> 00:15:13,515
on the products that will be
cultivated in this region.

180
00:15:13,887 --> 00:15:17,482
Anything you
need for production, seed...

181
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:21,404
tractor, diesel,
fertiliser, electricity...

182
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:24,400
will be supplied by the state.

183
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:26,435
More importantly...

184
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:32,683
the products you raise
in the common farms will...

185
00:15:33,047 --> 00:15:35,436
be bought by the statel mean...

186
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:42,079
your products won't be
bought cheaply by merchants.

187
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:44,877
So you won't...

188
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:50,717
be afraid of making loss when
you can't sell your products.

189
00:15:51,487 --> 00:15:54,320
You won't be indebted to produce.

190
00:15:57,727 --> 00:15:59,126
This is what I'll say.

191
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:03,361
I'll be glad to answer your questions.

192
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,325
Brother, Mehmet Aga didn't come.

193
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:12,556
Who's Mehmet Aga?

194
00:16:13,167 --> 00:16:14,122
Elif's father.

195
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,918
He didn't come.
We have to go. Quick.

196
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:19,919
It's good, but I don't understand...

197
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:23,483
why everyone has equal share?

198
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:27,962
For example,
Mehmet Aga has 300 decares of land.

199
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:33,199
Whereas Worm Hasan has 13,
maybe 15 decares of land.

200
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:35,643
Now, if we take part in these farms...

201
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:38,243
the two will get the same money, yes?

202
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:40,280
Is it true?

203
00:16:41,007 --> 00:16:42,366
Brother, come on, brother.

204
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:43,705
This man is probably
working in the field;

205
00:16:43,706 --> 00:16:44,842
We can catch him only now; come on.

206
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:49,286
Erhan, people are asking questions,
I have to answer these questions.

207
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:51,525
My brother, why are you
making things so difficult?

208
00:16:51,526 --> 00:16:52,676
What don't you understand?

209
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:55,321
Listen, you say Mehmet Aga has
300 decares of land, field, yes?

210
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:58,763
But, how did he get this land...

211
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:00,719
how did he buy these farms?

212
00:17:00,807 --> 00:17:04,038
Look, all of you were indebted;
All you were in debt to these banks.

213
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:09,116
This man bought your land very cheap;
And made...

214
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:11,602
your children worker
of himself on top of it...

215
00:17:11,727 --> 00:17:13,797
and you still defend Mehmet Aga, ha?

216
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:16,044
Let's go, let's go! Their
question don't end!

217
00:17:16,045 --> 00:17:18,080
We're too late.

218
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:22,282
- For God's sake, we are late!
- Erhan!

219
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:25,606
We'll solve it later. We'll
solve it later. He'll

220
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:27,164
tell you, my brotherwill
tell you everything.

221
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:32,926
My friends, I'll come later again...

222
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,206
in order to make further
explanation to you.

223
00:17:36,207 --> 00:17:37,560
Sorry about today.

224
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:39,798
- It's a matter of life and death!
- See you soon! Goodbye.

225
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:42,123
Brother, please be quick!

226
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:47,683
- So, why didn't you talk?
- I was just preparing to talk...

227
00:18:38,887 --> 00:18:41,003
- The man standing here is Susuzgil?
- Yes, he is.

228
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:44,125
Good, you wait here.

229
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:45,760
- You say so?
- Yes, it is.

230
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:30,718
- Is this farm yours?
- Yes.

231
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:33,837
Well, why those
people work on your...

232
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:36,718
farm as you bum around here?

233
00:19:36,847 --> 00:19:38,246
Who are you?

234
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:43,479
- You say this farm is yours, ha?
- I said yes!

235
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:48,405
- It's not.
- What the hell are you saying?

236
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:52,439
These farms are not yours anymore.
These are theirs!

237
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,957
They cultivate, but you eat!

238
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,364
This came to an end Mehmet!

239
00:20:00,327 --> 00:20:04,286
From now on, we are all together,
both when we rest and...

240
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:07,685
when we work on the field!

241
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,440
From now on, we will work
together and eat together!

242
00:20:12,647 --> 00:20:14,922
This farm, this soil, this tree...

243
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:17,716
this reaper belong to all of us!

244
00:20:19,047 --> 00:20:21,845
This farm belongs to Erhan
as much as it belongs to you!

245
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:26,321
Don't behave cruelly, it's useless.

246
00:20:27,847 --> 00:20:32,443
Don't upset your daughter
due to this land, this farm!

247
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:52,238
Long live our socialist government!

248
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:57,518
Long live our socialist government!

249
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:02,479
Long live our socialist government!

250
00:22:17,847 --> 00:22:20,307
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

251
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:22,264
You could not sleep
due to the noise, no?

252
00:22:22,265 --> 00:22:23,561
Yes.

253
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:27,238
Students organize a protest
to support the government.

254
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:31,759
What nice! Early on Sunday morning,
as everyone is asleep.

255
00:22:32,087 --> 00:22:35,124
It's noon Aynur!
It's not so early.

256
00:22:35,607 --> 00:22:38,758
- What time is it?
- It's near 1 pm.

257
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:41,886
- Is the tea ready?
- It's ready, but...

258
00:22:45,807 --> 00:22:47,877
The homeowner will be
at the door in a minute.

259
00:22:48,807 --> 00:22:50,081
Let's see him coming!

260
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:53,520
Let's see, but did you find the rent?

261
00:22:54,167 --> 00:22:56,476
You said you will
borrow from Fikret, did you?

262
00:22:57,447 --> 00:22:58,721
No, I did not.

263
00:22:59,647 --> 00:23:01,922
Did not, the man comes to what will?

264
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:04,166
We will give nothing!

265
00:23:04,407 --> 00:23:07,001
- What does it mean?
- That is it!

266
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:09,318
What we paid until today is enough!

267
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:12,760
- Are you crazy?
- No, I am not.

268
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:16,244
- So?
- The government published a decree.

269
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:21,603
We don't have to pay more than half
of our income to somebody as rent.

270
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:26,199
What the hell is this? This man doesn't
do anything apart from collecting rents!

271
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:29,924
What should he do? This is his house;
Should he donate this to us?

272
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:34,440
All these houses are him, yes, Aynur?
How can a man have 8 houses?

273
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:38,996
How can a man,
who did not work for time...

274
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:41,357
have 8 houses?

275
00:23:42,327 --> 00:23:46,639
If you work,
if are awake, you can have.

276
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,006
Don't I work?

277
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:55,597
People like you pay rents
for their whole life, like this...

278
00:23:57,407 --> 00:23:59,398
I asked you, don't I work?

279
00:23:59,687 --> 00:24:02,440
You work, actually you work hard.

280
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,165
But this doesn't help.

281
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:08,998
It doesn't help as I pay more than
half of my income to this man as rent!

282
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:12,679
What is that, I won't pay any rent!

283
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:15,879
OK than, we will be
homeless after this age...

284
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,306
Why will we become homeless Aynur?

285
00:24:18,307 --> 00:24:20,365
What are you talking about
Levent, for the God's sake?

286
00:24:20,687 --> 00:24:25,442
- We will get on the his house, yes?
- We don't get on anyone's house.

287
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:28,684
We need a house;
And here is a house.

288
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:31,356
This man has 7 more houses!

289
00:24:31,447 --> 00:24:34,757
Should we seize on his
house because he has 7 more?

290
00:24:34,847 --> 00:24:36,883
We don't seize anything!

291
00:24:37,327 --> 00:24:40,080
Until today,
rulers were on their side.

292
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:42,926
Today, some people consider us...

293
00:24:42,927 --> 00:24:44,997
work for us.

294
00:24:45,087 --> 00:24:47,965
- Communists!
- Yes, communists.

295
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:51,045
Levent, pull you together, please!

296
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:54,398
We can't find a new house
easily in such winter.

297
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:57,684
We will just be left
homeless after this age...

298
00:24:58,487 --> 00:25:01,365
You see, you said the same thing!

299
00:25:01,527 --> 00:25:05,326
We have worked for
35 years and we depend...

300
00:25:05,327 --> 00:25:08,000
on two words of the house owner!

301
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:11,956
Just two syllables! If he says "get
out", we are thrown to the street.

302
00:25:12,207 --> 00:25:15,085
Is this just, Aynur?
Can you bear this?

303
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:18,762
This is his house; he says get out,
or enter; he says what he wants.

304
00:25:18,847 --> 00:25:22,726
I hope he won't say "get out"
because we delayed to pay the rent.

305
00:25:22,807 --> 00:25:24,843
What hope?

306
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:28,045
I don't hope anything anymore.
What's this!

307
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:31,717
Hope this, hope that!
Look to the owner, look to the boss!

308
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:34,362
I won't hope anything anymore!

309
00:25:35,207 --> 00:25:37,187
So, you don't pay, I don'pay,
the other doesn't pay.

310
00:25:37,188 --> 00:25:39,166
How will this man live?

311
00:25:39,447 --> 00:25:41,756
He will work!
He will work once!

312
00:25:42,047 --> 00:25:45,642
He will produce,
maybe for the first time in his life!

313
00:25:46,407 --> 00:25:50,639
Also, he won't become homeless.
Nobody gets the house he lives in!

314
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,599
He has the guarantee to find a job.

315
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:56,558
Until today, their government
did nothing for us.

316
00:25:56,887 --> 00:25:59,879
But, look, ours doesn't leave
neither him homeless nor us.

317
00:26:00,247 --> 00:26:03,683
Ooo, communists became ours, no?

318
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:05,845
So, who are ours?

319
00:26:06,447 --> 00:26:11,601
I see, for the first time in my life,
that a government does something for us.

320
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:14,959
For the last two months I get on
the metro, the busess freely.

321
00:26:16,327 --> 00:26:20,843
For the first time in 12 years,
I could find a proper gift to you.

322
00:26:22,927 --> 00:26:25,157
- You say the sweater?
- Yes.

323
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:27,926
We you so annoyed because
you couldn't buy something to me?

324
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:29,082
Of course I was.

325
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:33,121
You gave your life to me. You dedicated
your beauty, your compassion.

326
00:26:33,247 --> 00:26:37,035
I couldn't give you anything
because I fed these parasites...

327
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:40,361
He came Levent.

328
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:44,806
Please tell that we will pay
in a couple of days. Don't be crazy.

329
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:46,559
Don't worry.

330
00:26:54,287 --> 00:26:56,881
- Selamun Aleyküm.
- What do you want?

331
00:26:57,647 --> 00:27:01,003
- I said selamün aleyküm.
- Aleyküm selam! What do you want?

332
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:03,722
You can expect what I want;
I came to get the rent.

333
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:06,117
What rent are you talking about?
There is no rent.

334
00:27:06,967 --> 00:27:09,879
I talk about rent of this house,
that you live in.

335
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:13,006
It seems you don't
know what's going on?

336
00:27:13,087 --> 00:27:15,157
I don't pay rent anymore.

337
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,284
How come? What do you
mean "what's going on"?

338
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:19,201
What are you talking about?

339
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:22,165
What I am talking about? I will show
you what I'm talking about.

340
00:27:22,247 --> 00:27:25,762
Seven: Everyone is owner
of the house he lives in.

341
00:27:25,847 --> 00:27:29,396
People living in houses improper to
health and dignity of human...

342
00:27:29,487 --> 00:27:32,399
being will move to new houses
in the one-year period.

343
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:36,685
Electricity, water and natural
gas bills will be free from now on.

344
00:27:36,887 --> 00:27:40,436
Basic needs will be met
freely under state guarantee.

345
00:27:40,647 --> 00:27:44,196
What does it say? Everyone is the
owner of the house he lives in.

346
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:47,643
So, I'm the owner of this house.
I don't pay any rent.

347
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:53,877
You trust in these communists,
but you will regret this!

348
00:27:54,447 --> 00:27:58,520
I actually regret paying
rent to you for years submissively!

349
00:27:58,847 --> 00:28:00,678
Go along, go!

350
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:04,641
OK, OK. You believe in those,
we will see your end?

351
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:06,883
You will see how I will throw
you out of my house!

352
00:28:07,647 --> 00:28:09,842
Do what you can do!

353
00:28:10,927 --> 00:28:14,158
Do you think I will just leave
this house to you? You will see!

354
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:28,076
- Come, I will make a coffee for you.
- OK.

355
00:29:10,767 --> 00:29:13,725
Friends! Friends!

356
00:29:14,007 --> 00:29:20,321
This factory is nationalized
by the socialist government.

357
00:29:20,487 --> 00:29:23,686
Your former boss doesn't have any...

358
00:29:23,687 --> 00:29:28,886
right or authority
on this factory anymore.

359
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:33,957
All rights related to this factory
belong to the socialist government...

360
00:29:34,047 --> 00:29:36,163
which means you.

361
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:41,206
A contact meeting will
be held this evening and...

362
00:29:41,207 --> 00:29:43,880
everyone is supposed to participate.

363
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:45,925
More power to all of us.

364
00:29:49,807 --> 00:29:53,243
Rıza Master, would they
decrease our wages, do you think?

365
00:29:54,247 --> 00:29:55,726
We will learn in the evening.

366
00:29:56,847 --> 00:29:59,315
Mind your own business,
don't think about this.

367
00:30:19,647 --> 00:30:21,239
Brother Rıza, what will happen?

368
00:30:21,327 --> 00:30:23,238
They said you have the rights...

369
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:26,882
How should I know Suat, we are going, we
will learn what rights they talk about?

370
00:30:28,247 --> 00:30:30,920
So, what will happen to bosses,
brother?

371
00:30:31,047 --> 00:30:34,437
God, you did everything for yourself,
you worry about the bosses!

372
00:30:36,087 --> 00:30:38,237
Do you think anyone will be fired?

373
00:30:38,527 --> 00:30:40,285
Nihat and others were anxious today.
They were

374
00:30:40,286 --> 00:30:42,042
members to rightist trade
union before, you know...

375
00:30:42,127 --> 00:30:45,324
Don't worry, they will not suffer.
They are men for all seasons.

376
00:30:45,447 --> 00:30:47,199
They will just shift to the
other trade union...

377
00:30:47,927 --> 00:30:50,395
Brother, if I am fired,
it would be a disaster...

378
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:53,400
Just before the wedding...
I already have no money.

379
00:30:53,487 --> 00:30:56,326
These were saying that
unemployment is banned;

380
00:30:56,327 --> 00:30:59,164
It is written on the
papers they distributed...

381
00:31:00,407 --> 00:31:02,722
Brother, should they
fire us first and put

382
00:31:02,723 --> 00:31:05,037
us in jail because we are unemployed?

383
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:07,602
Get along with you!
Come!

384
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:20,043
Until today, we worked
for 10-15 hours a day.

385
00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:22,283
Yet we could not survive on
our wges until the end of the month.

386
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:24,445
So, what we worked for?

387
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:27,201
To produce the cars
that we can never drive...

388
00:31:27,287 --> 00:31:30,165
toys that we can never
buy for our children...

389
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:33,802
clothes that we can only
see in the shop windows.

390
00:31:34,127 --> 00:31:36,766
Bosses get richer and
richer as we produced.

391
00:31:37,087 --> 00:31:40,124
They bought new machines.
They enlarged their factories.

392
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:44,676
In each new machine...

393
00:31:44,927 --> 00:31:47,680
each new factory
there is our labour...

394
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:51,806
our blood,
our children's stolen future.

395
00:31:52,527 --> 00:31:55,963
Today, here, and in thousands
of factories all around the country...

396
00:31:56,127 --> 00:31:58,880
production is not for bosses anymore.

397
00:31:59,487 --> 00:32:01,955
That is what nationalization
of factories means.

398
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:07,602
Nationalization is transition
of factories to you,

399
00:32:07,687 --> 00:32:09,996
to the producers, to workers...

400
00:32:11,327 --> 00:32:14,524
to their real owners.

401
00:32:14,647 --> 00:32:18,242
All other factories belong to
ourworker brothers from now on.

402
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:22,965
Machines in the factories we work in,
the goods we produce, all belong to us.

403
00:32:24,807 --> 00:32:27,037
So, we will work as before.

404
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:30,123
Of course we will continue to produce.

405
00:32:30,207 --> 00:32:33,040
We will continue working
heavily and sweating.

406
00:32:33,847 --> 00:32:35,678
But there is a difference:

407
00:32:36,927 --> 00:32:38,519
Things we produce...

408
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:41,798
won't be used to enhance
the wealth of others!

409
00:32:42,767 --> 00:32:44,764
For example, our labour
won't be used by

410
00:32:44,765 --> 00:32:46,760
the bosses to train
their children abroad.

411
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:52,477
We will work in our factories,
not theirs!

412
00:32:52,767 --> 00:32:54,687
We won't work for their interest...

413
00:32:54,688 --> 00:32:58,202
but we will work for millions
of workers like us!

414
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:01,325
This means, friends...

415
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:04,564
from now on, any profit
that is generated

416
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,600
from the sale of our products...

417
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:11,201
will be used for only
and only our interests.

418
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:14,317
For betterworking periods...

419
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:17,157
for decreasing unemployment...

420
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:19,722
for education of our children...

421
00:33:20,687 --> 00:33:23,838
for quality health service...

422
00:33:24,287 --> 00:33:27,404
for improving ourselves.

423
00:33:28,647 --> 00:33:31,639
Well, will there be any dismissal
or reduction in wages?

424
00:33:31,727 --> 00:33:33,638
I hope we won't be down
with our children...

425
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:37,443
No, from now on...

426
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:40,121
all shift bells will ring
as a symbol of your future...

427
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:44,206
your children's future
ourworker brothers' future.

428
00:33:45,967 --> 00:33:47,878
Don't worry to be unemployed.

429
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:51,759
One of the leading
responsibilities...

430
00:33:51,847 --> 00:33:54,281
of the socialist government is to...

431
00:33:55,607 --> 00:33:57,359
end the unemployment.

432
00:33:57,487 --> 00:33:59,381
Don't think how you should
survive till the end of

433
00:33:59,382 --> 00:34:01,275
month; don't worry for
your children's education.

434
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,438
Henceforth, any bread in this
country belongs to the producers...

435
00:34:05,527 --> 00:34:07,006
belongs to you!

436
00:34:07,487 --> 00:34:09,364
From now on, factories...

437
00:34:09,887 --> 00:34:15,723
schools, roads, and bread and books,
anything you see, belong to you!

438
00:34:16,567 --> 00:34:18,319
Long live our socialist revolution!

439
00:34:18,607 --> 00:34:22,919
Long live our socialist republic!
Long live our socialist republic!

440
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:00,359
What is the matter?

441
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:06,926
- They are nationalizing the factory.
- How come?

442
00:35:09,327 --> 00:35:11,318
The factory is seized.

443
00:35:12,807 --> 00:35:14,877
It will be operated
by the state from now on.

444
00:35:15,807 --> 00:35:18,879
- It's good or bad?
- I don't know

445
00:35:21,407 --> 00:35:23,443
I'm so confused.

446
00:35:24,527 --> 00:35:26,802
At least, you will
get your wages regularly.

447
00:35:27,407 --> 00:35:31,525
It won't be like you are paid for three
months and work free for two...

448
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:34,962
- We will wait and see.
- Yes, yes.

449
00:35:36,407 --> 00:35:39,205
Actually, I also don't think
that it will be worse.

450
00:35:46,047 --> 00:35:49,881
So, what is the matter?
You look so bemused...

451
00:35:51,407 --> 00:35:53,444
This is the first time
I entered into this

452
00:35:53,445 --> 00:35:55,480
restaurant, which I passed
by everyday for 20 years!

453
00:36:43,487 --> 00:36:45,318
A very urgent
document has arrived, sir.

454
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:47,246
Let's see, what this
urgent document is.

455
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:48,725
- Yes, sir.

456
00:37:00,847 --> 00:37:01,916
That's it!

457
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:05,963
- That's what I was waiting for!
- Sir?

458
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:12,918
Muster will be in 10 minutes.
You gather the soldiers, I'm coming.

459
00:37:13,207 --> 00:37:14,435
Yes, sir.

460
00:37:26,367 --> 00:37:28,722
At ease!
Shun!

461
00:37:29,407 --> 00:37:31,762
At ease!
Shun!

462
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:33,797

00:37:43,447 --> 00:37:46,246

00:37:49,207 --> 00:37:51,118

00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:46,363
Sevgi!

504
00:40:48,887 --> 00:40:50,718
Get the door, who has come?

505
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,075
Move in, bastard, move!

506
00:41:17,047 --> 00:41:18,526
Go there! Go there!

507
00:41:27,807 --> 00:41:28,637
Turn your face!

508
00:41:33,727 --> 00:41:34,955
Turn your face!

509
00:41:42,047 --> 00:41:43,366
Turb your face, bastard!

510
00:41:51,487 --> 00:41:52,636
Turb your face, bastard!

511
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:05,116
Don't look!

512
00:42:48,247 --> 00:42:49,236
Welcome.

513
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:17,085
Thank you, hope to see you again.

514
00:44:39,367 --> 00:44:42,046
In today's meeting of
Revolutionary Education Council...

515
00:44:42,047 --> 00:44:45,357
right of education in
mother-language is debated.

516
00:44:45,927 --> 00:44:49,126
It's said that the efforts to place the
right of education in mother language...

517
00:44:49,127 --> 00:44:50,667
in our popular education system are

518
00:44:50,668 --> 00:44:52,206
intensified and the
principle of right of...

519
00:44:52,207 --> 00:44:57,126
education in mother language, based
on the refusal of the discriminatory...

520
00:44:57,127 --> 00:45:00,358
and denialist policies of the
former system will be in short time...

521
00:45:00,687 --> 00:45:04,326
Yıldırım Karakaş, the assistant
professor of Istanbul University...

522
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:07,637
Faculty of Political Sciences
and author, is assassinated...

523
00:45:08,007 --> 00:45:09,924
Students and friends
of professor Yıldırım

524
00:45:09,925 --> 00:45:11,841
are continuing to arrive to his house.

525
00:45:11,967 --> 00:45:14,435
They filled the front of the
house with candles and flowers...

526
00:45:14,847 --> 00:45:17,839
Police sketch prepared according
to the witnesses' statements are...

527
00:45:17,887 --> 00:45:19,843
distributed to the
press a few minuted ago...

528
00:46:26,087 --> 00:46:27,406
Aleyküm selam.

529
00:46:32,047 --> 00:46:33,196
Chief, are you?

530
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,635
Yes, thank you.
I'm in the hotel, I'll go out.

531
00:46:38,407 --> 00:46:41,285
Chief, this, this...

532
00:46:41,847 --> 00:46:47,240
this suitcase is still in the hotel,
nobody came to get this.

533
00:46:57,687 --> 00:47:00,201
It can create problem
if I carry this...

534
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:14,437
Good, OK. OK. Of course.
God bless you, too. Al right.

535
00:49:08,167 --> 00:49:09,361
Would drink something?

536
00:49:12,087 --> 00:49:13,998
Sorry, would you drink something?

537
00:49:15,247 --> 00:49:16,726
I said would you drink something?

538
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,065
What do you say?

539
00:49:18,066 --> 00:49:19,442
I asked you if you
want something to drink.

540
00:49:20,007 --> 00:49:21,326
Give me beer.

541
00:50:24,927 --> 00:50:27,236
I'm here to take you to the chief.

542
00:50:27,807 --> 00:50:30,116
Yes, where is the chief.

543
00:50:32,967 --> 00:50:36,676
Really I don't know this;
Ask him to those guys if you want!

544
00:50:38,287 --> 00:50:39,515
Shit!

545
00:50:41,887 --> 00:50:43,878
Catch him!

546
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:47,923
Walk!

547
00:50:50,207 --> 00:50:51,401
Move up.

548
00:51:19,247 --> 00:51:20,726
We brought the man, brother.

549
00:51:26,447 --> 00:51:27,402
I'm coming.

550
00:51:59,087 --> 00:52:00,759
I'm coming.

551
00:52:01,447 --> 00:52:04,200
Isn't there any hanging lamp?

552
00:52:06,087 --> 00:52:08,885
- No.
- Something like hanger?

553
00:52:13,607 --> 00:52:16,679
- Why did you kill professor Yıldırım?
- I didn't kill anyone.

554
00:52:39,727 --> 00:52:41,001
Why do you look at me?

555
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:46,316
Why do you look at me?
Should I be scared of you?

556
00:52:47,087 --> 00:52:50,523
Why do you look at me?
Will you beat me, ha? Come, hit me.

557
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:52,924
Come.
Why do you look in that way?

558
00:53:15,927 --> 00:53:21,047
These are book of professor Yıldırım,
who you killed in his house.

559
00:53:22,247 --> 00:53:24,761
He has written 18 books, certainly.

560
00:53:26,367 --> 00:53:28,722
Maybe they killed your precious
professor because of that...

561
00:53:29,527 --> 00:53:31,757
because of what he has written.

562
00:53:35,007 --> 00:53:37,237
You fired 2 bullets to the professor.

563
00:53:38,967 --> 00:53:42,084
The man who has written
18 books is dead...

564
00:53:43,207 --> 00:53:45,402
the man who fired
2 bullets to him is alive.

565
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:50,842
I didn't shut anybody, brother.
You are on the wrong way.

566
00:53:53,247 --> 00:53:57,365
Have you read
18 books in your life, ha?

567
00:54:01,567 --> 00:54:04,877
No, I didn't.

568
00:54:05,847 --> 00:54:07,838
Will you put me in jail because
I didn't read books?

569
00:54:12,167 --> 00:54:13,395
Listen, my brother...

570
00:54:16,447 --> 00:54:19,917
I didn't kill anyone;
But God bless him, whoever killed him!

571
00:54:21,127 --> 00:54:23,357
He must be a patriot...

572
00:54:24,447 --> 00:54:27,325
a brave man so killed this guy.

573
00:54:27,887 --> 00:54:30,959
What did professor Yıldırım
do to deserve to be killed?

574
00:54:31,967 --> 00:54:34,162
He must be just like you,
I mean communist.

575
00:54:36,207 --> 00:54:37,526
You think...

576
00:54:39,607 --> 00:54:41,484
that your trashy system...

577
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:43,883
will last long but...

578
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:49,604
patriot children of this
country are not dead yet.

579
00:54:51,047 --> 00:54:53,686
They will...

580
00:54:54,407 --> 00:54:57,160
reverse the system you found now.

581
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:00,561
- From which schools you graduated?
- It's none of your business.

582
00:55:01,687 --> 00:55:03,564
Why didn't you go to school
after the primary schools?

583
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:08,005
Because we didn't have
money to go to schools;

584
00:55:08,006 --> 00:55:09,643
We found a job and
worked, is this wrong?

585
00:55:12,247 --> 00:55:15,603
- Do you have a brother or sister?
- No, no...

586
00:55:22,127 --> 00:55:23,355
Your sister...

587
00:55:24,407 --> 00:55:27,922
was one of the best students
of professor Yıldırım, who you killed.

588
00:55:29,167 --> 00:55:30,680
Also, she was a member to the party.

589
00:55:31,847 --> 00:55:33,565
Now she is studying
in a second university.

590
00:55:35,127 --> 00:55:39,086
She's studying in a second university,
thanks to socialism.

591
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:43,604
You graduated from the
primary school hardly...

592
00:55:44,767 --> 00:55:48,157
whereas your sister is studying in a
second university, thanks to socialism.

593
00:55:51,007 --> 00:55:52,884
Meral will be very surprised now!

594
00:55:54,727 --> 00:55:56,479
Should she be upset
for her brother...

595
00:55:57,447 --> 00:56:01,599
or her professor
killed by her brother?

596
00:56:04,287 --> 00:56:07,324
I didn't kill anyone;
But God bless who did this!

597
00:56:12,167 --> 00:56:13,395
Listen, Muammer.

598
00:56:14,967 --> 00:56:18,437
These socialist who you
hate got rid of all...

599
00:56:19,887 --> 00:56:24,358
American bases in this county,
which you claim you love.

600
00:56:26,607 --> 00:56:31,635
Those socialists saved this country
from being slave soldiers of NATO.

601
00:56:34,607 --> 00:56:38,919
These socialist you look
forward to kill saved...

602
00:56:40,607 --> 00:56:43,997
these people from
exploitation of bosses.

603
00:56:45,807 --> 00:56:47,763
They made people happy.

604
00:56:50,767 --> 00:56:53,076
How do you love your country,
Muammer?

605
00:56:54,487 --> 00:56:58,605
You kill the beloved
figured of this society, Muammer.

606
00:56:59,527 --> 00:57:02,246
Is this patriotism?
Yes?

607
00:57:02,607 --> 00:57:05,883
What do you want?
Which system will you reverse?

608
00:57:06,407 --> 00:57:08,682
Do you want to be slave of US again?

609
00:57:09,087 --> 00:57:12,284
Why do you serve to US, Muammer, why?

610
00:57:13,407 --> 00:57:17,195
Do you want people die at the
doors of hospitals again?

611
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,081
Do you want them work for
14-15 hours a day?

612
00:57:20,287 --> 00:57:23,484
Is this patriotism, Muammer?
Is this?

613
00:57:24,727 --> 00:57:27,082
Do you want people
die of hungerwhile...

614
00:57:27,287 --> 00:57:30,404
some pack their stomachs?
Do you?

615
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:32,165
Do you want our children bring up...

616
00:57:32,247 --> 00:57:35,080
in barracks while
others live in residences?

617
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:37,636
Answer, Muammer, say what you want!

618
00:57:53,127 --> 00:57:54,196
Listen, Muammer.

619
00:57:58,687 --> 00:58:01,440
Now I will leave this paper...

620
00:58:04,567 --> 00:58:06,125
and pencil to you.

621
00:58:09,207 --> 00:58:10,640
You will give me...

622
00:58:12,047 --> 00:58:13,878
the names of who made you do this...

623
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:18,762
who made you fire that gun...

624
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:21,644
who made you carry this suitcase...

625
00:58:22,487 --> 00:58:25,923
who made you
kill your sister's professor.

626
00:58:27,647 --> 00:58:29,000
You will give these names...

627
00:58:30,167 --> 00:58:32,681
so the country will not turn
to a burial ground again!

628
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,998
You are an excellent liar my brother.

629
00:58:36,367 --> 00:58:37,277
Bravo!

630
00:58:38,607 --> 00:58:41,804
My sister has no business
with such organization...

631
00:58:45,687 --> 00:58:46,836
Muammer.

632
00:58:48,927 --> 00:58:51,725
You should at least once think
about protecting your sister...

633
00:58:53,167 --> 00:58:57,001
rather than protecting
those who made you a killer...

634
00:59:03,087 --> 00:59:06,762
Now, if it is right what's
written in this document...

635
00:59:10,087 --> 00:59:12,681
I think, you should protect this...

636
00:59:13,287 --> 00:59:16,757
because the first thing I do when...

637
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:20,279
I get out of here
will be making this.

638
00:59:23,807 --> 00:59:25,167
Brother, it's 7 pm,
I've got to bring...

639
00:59:25,168 --> 00:59:26,526
Give.

640
00:59:39,487 --> 00:59:41,557
- What's this?
- Your dinner!

641
00:59:42,527 --> 00:59:43,755
Enjoy your meal.

642
00:59:49,607 --> 00:59:50,642
I'll ask something.

643
00:59:52,767 --> 00:59:54,166
When is the breakfast?

644
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,246
At eight...

645
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:28,084
Good evening dear audience.

646
01:01:28,727 --> 01:01:32,003
We have again a precious guest
this evening in "Political Diary".

647
01:01:32,607 --> 01:01:35,883
Minister of Education Gamze Kosar,
one of the youngest members...

648
01:01:36,247 --> 01:01:37,999
of the new revolutionary government.

649
01:01:38,207 --> 01:01:41,165
- Welcome dear minister.
- Thank you.

650
01:01:41,367 --> 01:01:44,325
I want to draw
attention to a current issue...

651
01:01:44,487 --> 01:01:46,239
without losing time.

652
01:01:46,447 --> 01:01:50,042
One of the most important
actions is seems...

653
01:01:50,247 --> 01:01:53,045
to be making education free.

654
01:01:53,407 --> 01:01:56,843
However, some people object
to these free education policy.

655
01:01:57,167 --> 01:01:59,965
These objections include the claim
that the revolutionary government...

656
01:02:00,167 --> 01:02:02,283
seized the right
of choice of people and...

657
01:02:02,487 --> 01:02:05,206
deprived them
of many opportunities...

658
01:02:05,447 --> 01:02:08,803
that were available before
with this free education action.

659
01:02:09,167 --> 01:02:12,842
So, dear minister, how do you
assess these criticisms?

660
01:02:13,167 --> 01:02:16,876
Yes, it is certainly true
that we deprived some...

661
01:02:16,967 --> 01:02:19,435
people of many
opportunities and chances!

662
01:02:19,927 --> 01:02:22,680
We deprived the owners of private
schools and private institutions...

663
01:02:23,047 --> 01:02:25,925
of the opportunity to rub the
people and students!

664
01:02:26,487 --> 01:02:29,126
We deprived some
people of the privilege...

665
01:02:29,247 --> 01:02:30,805
to be educated just...

666
01:02:31,007 --> 01:02:32,725
because they have money!

667
01:02:32,847 --> 01:02:35,839
And we deprive the poor students of the
"privilege" to be not educated and...

668
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:39,244
to be unemployed just because
they do not have money!

669
01:02:39,807 --> 01:02:41,445
Don't suppose that people...

670
01:02:41,527 --> 01:02:44,678
people want back these
"opportunities"...

671
01:02:45,087 --> 01:02:47,885
like paying enrollment deposits
and dues to schools...

672
01:02:47,927 --> 01:02:49,883
or paying a big share of income...

673
01:02:50,127 --> 01:02:53,005
to private institutions
and moreover...

674
01:02:53,207 --> 01:02:57,723
being very far away
from getting a modern and...

675
01:02:57,967 --> 01:02:59,878
scientific education service.

676
01:03:00,727 --> 01:03:04,163
What you mention is indeed
only the objections of some...

677
01:03:04,367 --> 01:03:07,677
privileged classes who don't
want to lose these privileges...

678
01:03:07,767 --> 01:03:09,997
that they had due to their wealth.

679
01:03:10,327 --> 01:03:14,206
And this is not a subject
that we will discuss on.

680
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:17,724
As we mention constantly,
the remaning...

681
01:03:17,967 --> 01:03:21,437
private schools will be publicized
in the near future and...

682
01:03:21,767 --> 01:03:24,679
private education
will totally be terminated.

683
01:09:25,287 --> 01:09:28,518
The socialist government will
survive with your support!

684
01:09:28,847 --> 01:09:32,157
Now you have the power!
You are the government!

685
01:09:32,527 --> 01:09:36,361
You save your government!
We end the rule of money!

686
01:09:36,687 --> 01:09:38,962
We embed private education and...

687
01:09:39,167 --> 01:09:40,919
private health to the history!

688
01:09:41,647 --> 01:09:44,639
We take back everything
they seized...

689
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:48,636
we take back our schools,
our hospitals...

690
01:09:49,247 --> 01:09:51,317
our roads, our rivers!

691
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:54,923
The socialst government
ends the rule of pillage.

692
01:09:55,447 --> 01:09:59,838
We embed poverty,
hunger and slavery to the history!

693
01:11:03,207 --> 01:11:06,756
Murat, my son!
Your bills...

694
01:11:07,727 --> 01:11:09,160
Murat, my son!

695
01:12:11,207 --> 01:12:12,686
Yes, what is the matter?

696
01:12:13,247 --> 01:12:15,442
Do your bills come?

697
01:12:17,327 --> 01:12:19,761
Tövbe estağfurullah tövbe!

698
01:12:20,887 --> 01:12:22,286
At this time of the night!

699
01:13:34,567 --> 01:13:36,046
I want to...

700
01:13:37,047 --> 01:13:38,639
ask something.

701
01:13:40,647 --> 01:13:41,762
Yes, my aunt?

702
01:13:42,807 --> 01:13:46,243
My bills don't come for some days...

703
01:13:47,207 --> 01:13:49,675
They won't.
We don't send bills anymore.

704
01:13:50,247 --> 01:13:54,081
How come?
Why don't you send my bills?

705
01:13:54,287 --> 01:13:56,278
We don't send to anyone, my aunt.

706
01:13:56,407 --> 01:14:00,161
From now on, electricity,
water and natural gas are free.

707
01:14:02,687 --> 01:14:05,485
So, bills won't come anymore?

708
01:14:06,167 --> 01:14:09,477
No, they won't; and you will not get
tired to come here and pay your bills.

709
01:14:13,367 --> 01:14:15,039
What will I do?

710
01:14:40,367 --> 01:14:42,198
Committee are calling you!

711
01:14:42,567 --> 01:14:44,683
Committees are calling to
inclue more people...

712
01:14:44,967 --> 01:14:47,083
to organize more tightly...

713
01:14:47,487 --> 01:14:50,684
to get up against fascist crews...

714
01:14:50,847 --> 01:14:53,202
imperialist and their collaborators.

715
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,523
Listen to the raising...

716
01:14:55,927 --> 01:15:00,603
voice of the revolution...

717
01:15:00,967 --> 01:15:03,117
for the future of children...

718
01:15:03,487 --> 01:15:08,561
for our forests, waters,
lands and our bread!

719
01:15:08,847 --> 01:15:12,123
Struggle against capitalists,

720
01:15:12,447 --> 01:15:18,841
imperialists, fascists is continuing.

721
01:15:19,247 --> 01:15:22,045
Workers are continuing their struggle...

722
01:15:22,367 --> 01:15:24,483
organizing in committees.

723
01:15:24,767 --> 01:15:26,564
The struggle continues!

724
01:15:26,967 --> 01:15:29,925
And it will continue
until this country...

725
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:34,285
belongs to its real owners,
to workers...

726
01:15:34,767 --> 01:15:37,076
to producers!

727
01:21:27,047 --> 01:21:29,845
Comrade!
Selamün aleyküm!

728
01:21:34,607 --> 01:21:36,598
Comrades, what is going on here?

729
01:21:37,047 --> 01:21:38,878
- They are shutting, brother.
- They are shutting?

730
01:21:39,007 --> 01:21:41,758
So, what...
what will be built here?

731
01:21:41,887 --> 01:21:44,085
I am not sure brother, but they say
a Community Centre will be built.

732
01:21:44,086 --> 01:21:45,900
Community centre?
Ohh, this will be very nice, very nice!

733
01:21:57,127 --> 01:21:58,765
More power to you!

734
01:22:06,047 --> 01:22:09,278
- Where are you going?
- I am going to the dentist.

735
01:22:09,407 --> 01:22:11,284
- I will be back in the afternoon.
- OK.

736
01:22:20,047 --> 01:22:23,119
- More power to you, youngsters!
- Thank you, brother.

737
01:22:23,287 --> 01:22:25,164
Long live workers' and
peasants' government!

738
01:22:25,165 --> 01:22:27,041
Very nice, very nice!

739
01:22:33,767 --> 01:22:36,326
- What are you doing here?
- We are waiting for the service bus.

740
01:22:36,327 --> 01:22:37,521
We are going to police office.

741
01:22:37,647 --> 01:22:40,320
Why do you look so sour?
Grim-looking!

742
01:22:40,447 --> 01:22:43,678
Smile.
Or I'll report you.

743
01:22:44,207 --> 01:22:47,882
No of fence, I should report you.
Smile a little.

744
01:22:53,687 --> 01:22:55,906
Don't forget. Please come regularly.
Get well soon.

745
01:22:55,907 --> 01:22:58,124
Thank you. Have a nice day.

746
01:23:04,127 --> 01:23:07,005
- Hello.
- Welcome.

747
01:23:07,807 --> 01:23:11,641
I want to have my teeth examined.

748
01:23:12,447 --> 01:23:15,564
- OK. May I have your ID?
- ID.

749
01:23:23,687 --> 01:23:26,846
OK. You got to second floor.
I am doing your registry...

750
01:23:26,847 --> 01:23:28,599
my friends will call you.

751
01:23:29,727 --> 01:23:32,605
- What if they don't?
- Don't worry, they will.

752
01:23:32,847 --> 01:23:37,477
OK, but, if they don't?

753
01:23:37,967 --> 01:23:41,721
If they don't, you come to me.

754
01:23:41,847 --> 01:23:43,246
They will call...

755
01:24:39,687 --> 01:24:41,757
- Neşet Gülerce.
- I'm here.

756
01:24:42,007 --> 01:24:43,486
Come in, the doctor
is waiting for you.

757
01:24:49,967 --> 01:24:51,082
Hi.

758
01:24:57,247 --> 01:24:58,077
Hi.

759
01:24:59,407 --> 01:25:01,875
- Sit down there.
- Here?

760
01:25:02,447 --> 01:25:03,562
Yes.

761
01:25:07,207 --> 01:25:08,686
What is your problem?

762
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:15,883
- My theet.
- What is wrong with your teeth?

763
01:25:16,767 --> 01:25:17,882
They ache.

764
01:25:20,727 --> 01:25:25,039
- How long?
- For 30 years.

765
01:25:26,007 --> 01:25:27,725
Why didn't you come for such years?

766
01:25:29,447 --> 01:25:30,516
I am here.

767
01:25:31,127 --> 01:25:32,583
You said your teeth
ache for 30 years; I am

768
01:25:32,584 --> 01:25:34,039
asking why didn't you
come for such period?

769
01:25:34,647 --> 01:25:37,445
I came once;
They filled my tooth.

770
01:25:38,487 --> 01:25:41,206
- So?
- They...

771
01:25:41,367 --> 01:25:44,803
removed the filling because
I couldn't pay the money!

772
01:25:48,607 --> 01:25:50,120
Let's see your teeth.

773
01:25:51,687 --> 01:25:56,636
Mr. Doctor,
I love toothpaste ads.

774
01:25:56,887 --> 01:25:58,639
I always watch them, I mean.

775
01:25:58,767 --> 01:26:01,725
I want to have pearly white teeth.

776
01:26:01,847 --> 01:26:04,042
I want to...

777
01:26:04,167 --> 01:26:06,840
laugh pearly white, I mean.

778
01:26:07,367 --> 01:26:08,784
If you used that
toothpaste for once...

779
01:26:08,785 --> 01:26:10,200
Mr. Doctor...

780
01:26:10,367 --> 01:26:13,040
we used to be deprived
of underpants before the revolution!

781
01:26:13,167 --> 01:26:15,556
How could we buy toothbrush,
toothpaste?

782
01:26:15,727 --> 01:26:18,525
Thank god the revolution
happened so I am here.

783
01:26:18,687 --> 01:26:23,078
From now on, I promise, I will come
to you every 6 months for my teeth.

784
01:26:23,407 --> 01:26:24,556
What a chance!

785
01:26:26,847 --> 01:26:30,601
Open your month.
Open it more, open.

786
01:26:41,167 --> 01:26:42,839
How are my teeth?

787
01:26:47,647 --> 01:26:50,115
You forget about the revolution.
It will take wrong...

788
01:26:51,247 --> 01:26:53,227
I'm prescribing a medicine.
Come here 15 days later.

789
01:26:53,228 --> 01:26:55,206
We're going to x-ray your
teeth and see again.

790
01:26:56,567 --> 01:26:57,602
Doctor...

791
01:27:00,127 --> 01:27:03,961
I am 59 years old.
I am worker for 30 years.

792
01:27:04,327 --> 01:27:05,919
How long will I live!

793
01:27:06,287 --> 01:27:08,482
Just look at my teeth,
fix it and I will go.

794
01:27:09,007 --> 01:27:12,158
I read the rights
of patients while waiting.

795
01:27:12,567 --> 01:27:16,116
Iso, you said
"forget the revolution" blah blah...

796
01:27:17,527 --> 01:27:19,643
I will report you.

797
01:27:21,127 --> 01:27:23,277
Don't believe all the words you read.

798
01:27:24,407 --> 01:27:29,162
Doctor;
I want to change my doctor.

799
01:27:30,727 --> 01:27:33,082
- OK! Go to another doctor, go!
- No.

800
01:27:33,567 --> 01:27:36,206
I'm staying here, you're going!

801
01:27:37,567 --> 01:27:41,037
- Brother, are you insane?
- Get out! I'm patient.

802
01:28:12,647 --> 01:28:13,796
Neşet Bey.

803
01:28:13,927 --> 01:28:16,122
Another doctor will
be here in five minutes.

804
01:28:16,447 --> 01:28:17,846
Good!

805
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:25,119
Now I really believe that
there is a revolution!
