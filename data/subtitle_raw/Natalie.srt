Natali

9
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,460
Oh, is that you, Ma'am?

10
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:02,304
Yes, it is.

11
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,208
- I'II Iet you know.
- Yes, give me a call.

12
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,508
- Have a safe trip.
- Yes.

13
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,014
- Mr. Han.
- Congratulations.

14
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:16,022
Thank you. PIease be kind on the review.
Mr Han, Get home safely.

15
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,835
It was unbelievably successful.

16
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:33,531
Everything is sold.
AII of them except Natali.

17
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:44,846
You were fabulous today.

18
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,651
Oh, and that guy called again.

19
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:56,057
He said he was in your class
in college. CIass of '97, he said.

20
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:03,501
I told him that if he wanted to see you
so much, he should just come by sometime.

21
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:11,400
- Should I tell him not to come?
- No, Iet him.

22
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,107
Are you going to sell Natali?

23
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:26,320
The journalists are wondering
who Natali's real model is.

24
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,200
Hello. My name is Jang Min Woo.

25
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:12,999
Hello.

26
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:16,701
I'm here to see professor Hwang.
Is he here?

27
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,004
What is it about?

28
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:23,310
Hum. I think I have told you that
I would Iike to purchase Natali.

29
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:28,320
I'm sorryto say, but I don't
think that will happen.

30
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,722
Why not?

31
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:38,627
Why do you want her so badly?

32
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:45,629
- Because I also have a secret my own.
- What secret?

33
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,181
The exhibition is over.

34
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:09,483
- Professor Hwang Jun-hyuk?
- Yes, I am.

35
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,990
Hello. I'm Jang Min-woo.

36
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,991
I was moved by your work. Wait, wait.

37
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:26,694
Would you Iet me write
a review on your work?

38
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,507
You want to write about my work?

39
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,802
I don't even know you.

40
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,814
No, wait. Professor,

41
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:40,216
I was one of your students.
In art school, class of '97

42
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,629
Natali.

43
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,035
I would Iike to hear
more about Natali.

44
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:21,686
Don't you dare touch it.

45
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,198
What do you want to
hear about Natali?

46
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:37,800
I can feel her spirit.

47
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,605
It's as if she's alive.

48
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,416
And it seems she
is waiting for someone.

49
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,217
Who the hell are you?

50
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,030
Tell me about her.

51
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,531
The real person.
Who is the real Natali?

52
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,632
Are you asking the difference
between reality and art?

53
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,541
I'm asking about the real
model of Natali.

54
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:19,144
Hey, this work of art and the model
have nothing in common.

55
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,851
Are you saying that Natali
was created on its own?

56
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,555
I am not sure if you have
a theme of this review.

57
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:31,461
My theme is on Natali.

58
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,068
Just have some tea.

59
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:46,675
Here.

60
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,380
Don't even dream about
writing about my work.

61
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:06,626
We actually don't need permission
from anyone to write art reviews.

62
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:17,434
Jang Min-woo, or Jung Min-woo.
Whatever your name is.

63
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,341
My name is Jang Min-woo.

64
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:24,549
Mr. Jang, you put down of other
people's work to make a Iiving.

65
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:30,446
So, you want me to give you
something to gossip about?

66
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:45,866
People Iike you don't deserve
to exist in this world.

67
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:52,071
Stop threatening other people,
and do something more creative.

68
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,375
I agree on that, but

69
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:04,312
who will write about your great
work of creation then?

70
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:10,021
If it wasn't for me, those rocks...

71
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,525
Did you just say rocks?

72
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,331
No, I meant your work

73
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:22,335
would be valued simply by
its weight but nothing else.

74
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:42,453
Don't be surprised. This is just
a piece of rock, just Iike you said.

75
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:50,168
In your eyes, what does it Iook Iike?
A turtle or an elephant?

76
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:58,677
Do you know the difference between
a sculptor and a stonecutter?

77
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:06,116
If he thinks as he cuts,
he's a sculptor.

78
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:09,518
On the other side, a stonemaker
cut for work and not for art.

79
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:15,527
What about the one who made Inscriptions
on your ancestor's headstones?

80
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:19,223
Is he a sculptor or a stonecutter?

81
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,224
Well.

82
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,836
Do you think you know what art is?

83
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,630
Can you Iook at
the nature of objects?

84
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,242
No.

85
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:39,340
But Professor, I don't think you can
see the nature of women either.

86
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:46,253
Ah. Are we talking
about curator Park?

87
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:51,062
What? Did she criticize me?

88
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,361
Are you afraid of other
people's criticism?

89
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:02,806
No. Whatever she says
is not important to me.

90
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,501
Why is that?

91
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,009
Because she is in Iove with me.

92
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,106
Well.

93
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:18,316
What do you know about
me and curator Park?

94
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:26,123
Well, if she Ioved you, she wouldn't
call you such as a sex fiend.

95
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:34,330
Young man.
One poet once said that

96
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,038
Iove is a bitch.

97
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:45,650
Do you want to sleep with her?

98
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,011
The world consists of two parts:
men and women.

99
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,515
It's Iike yin and yang, so to speak.

100
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:24,518
She Ioved my work at first, then
she got attached physically but.

101
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,322
I just know once having
her in my bed.

102
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:35,429
She's just a bit angry at me
because she can't have me.

103
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,228
She knows there's another
woman in my heart.

104
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:41,830
A well known, but madly
ill-mannered sculptor

105
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,643
and a curator who needs his work.

106
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,638
She could have been
faking an orgasm.

107
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,446
Yeah?

108
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:57,355
Anyways, she forgets
while we have sex.

109
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,183
When the sex is over,
she is angry again.

110
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:08,591
Do you have sex
with only one woman?

111
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:12,186
Talk to me.

112
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:17,693
I'm curious about you.

113
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,700
Are you married?

114
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:33,810
You must be married.
You must Iove your wife very much.

115
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,221
How would you know all that?

116
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,019
You wouldn't even cheat.
You don't Iook Iike the type.

117
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,020
Stop it. Do you think I am an idiot?

118
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,024
No. You Iook too serious.

119
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,126
In fact, disgustingly sincere.

120
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,841
Not all men have to

121
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,537
fool around Iike you do.

122
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:06,277
Come on! That's a given
in this country.

123
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:11,682
Motels outnumber churches
in this country.

124
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,393
Do you know how the motel
owners make a Iiving?

125
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,794
Yes, honey.

126
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:23,197
I'm at the office.

127
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:37,504
Huh? It's just a headache.

128
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,014
Gotta go for a meeting.
Talk to you Iater.

129
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,720
A married woman sends her husband
to work in the morning as usual.

130
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,628
Have you ever had sex with a woman
at 1 1AM overlooking the river?

131
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,030
Do you believe in monogamy?

132
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,965
What you see isn't all truth.

133
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,473
It's becoming a world of polygamy.

134
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,372
Adultery is simply
a word from the past.

135
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,654
Is your wife at home as she says?

136
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:44,159
Or is she with another man in a bed?
Don't you want to know the truth?

137
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:48,866
PIease, don't apply your experience
to everyone else's.

138
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:54,176
There are many people in this world
who Iive with Iove and truth.

139
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,211
Why was it that a King had 3000
concubines in his palace back then?

140
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,416
Do you want to be a king?

141
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,025
I'm just a sculptor.

142
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:18,327
Ten years ago,
after your Iast exhibition.

143
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:21,839
Didn't you say that you won't create
or release any more work?

144
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,135
I did say that.

145
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,036
What made you change your mind?

146
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:30,548
I don't ask you to understand
a fickle minded artist.

147
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:36,153
What is the reason that
you released to the press

148
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:40,853
your ten year old work, Natali?

149
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:45,363
It's the gallery's marketing planning.
That's what they do.

150
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,866
I know someone who'd Iike to
purchase Natali at the highest price.

151
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:54,171
- I'm just not.
- And why is that?

152
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:01,503
Just don't want to.

153
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,615
I'II buy it.

154
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,220
I doubt you can afford it.

155
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:23,324
Yes, I know very well.
Kan Yakumari was $10,000.

156
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:27,031
149 Sitalie was $20,000.
Kali was $30,000.

157
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:31,041
Gauri, the goddess that nurtures
all Iands was priced at $50,000.

158
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,044
Oh, that's impressive.

159
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:38,248
You're smarter than Curator Park.

160
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,053
So, how much are you
going to sell Natalie for?

161
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:47,350
I'm afraid this is not a grocery market
where you can buy anything.

162
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,862
Of course not, I value
your work. I will pay.

163
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:54,763
- Can you afford it?
- Yes. I have enough.

164
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,461
I don't think you have earned
enough yet at your age.

165
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,698
Did you inherit a Iot?

166
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,607
Just give me the price.

167
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:10,614
It's impossible to
estimate its value.

168
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:21,023
And your other work can?

169
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:24,721
In that sense,
I feel bad for them.

170
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:29,824
Anyway, I won't sell Natali.

171
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,734
There's a special
story behind Natali.

172
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,437
OK, then.

173
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:45,649
It really is hard dealing
with a stubborn artist.

174
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:48,042
Thank you for taking your time.

175
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:56,150
You!

176
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,292
Why are you so obsessed
with Natali, anyway?

177
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,994
You didn't come in here
for an art review, did you?

178
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,717
Do you know Natali?

179
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:27,725
Tell me! Do you know
who Natali is? Huh?

180
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:35,725
Before I answer this,

181
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:41,832
tell me who you think Natali is.

182
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:47,545
I'II tell you who Natali is.

183
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,992
Natali is me.
It's me, Hyo-rim Park.

184
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:05,995
Curator Park,

185
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,397
do you really think that it is you?

186
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,004
You can never be Natali.

187
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,011
Then,

188
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:30,314
you played with me to
make this piece of metal?

189
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,023
You son of a bitch.

190
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:04,082
What you're holding
is the woman I Iove.

191
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:53,428
I wanted to create the most
beautiful woman in the world.

192
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,029
I'II get ready.

193
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:03,070
Curator Park was also
part of my inspiration.

194
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,985
But nothing or nobody
could truly help me.

195
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,191
They were all just useless
and obvious imitations.

196
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:34,603
Days turned into months.
I simply couldn't do anything.

197
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:03,829
Stunning body movements
mixed with mortal seduction.

198
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:10,734
Right after that moment,
she invaded my Iife completely.

199
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:16,042
Until now, in various art works,
sculptures and construction projects,

200
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,139
have been used in various ways.

201
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,343
Even the Egyptian pyramids

202
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,854
were built using this
golden proportion.

203
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:31,254
Especially symbols and figures.

204
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:41,463
She excited me to recreate
her through my hands.

205
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:48,078
'Art and our desire towards it'

206
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,476
Because human beings
can't exist forever,

207
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:55,178
we Iive with the dilemma
we dream of eternity.

208
00:30:55,753 --> 00:31:01,020
So we desire to capture
the beauty at the peak of it.

209
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:06,429
We always desire to
be more beautiful.

210
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:10,627
I believe that every art
piece begins from this.

211
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,135
Do you understand?

212
00:31:13,104 --> 00:31:16,437
- OK, that's all.
- Thank you.

213
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:25,344
- You have a nice vacation too.
- Professor, please get married this year.

214
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:33,356
- Professor?
- Yes?

215
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:35,756
Would you sign this to celebrate
the end of the semester?

216
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:40,463
Autograph? Sure.

217
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:46,070
- What's your name?
- Don't you know my name?

218
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:46,865
Pardon?

219
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:51,869
- It's Mi-ran. Oh Mi-ran.
- AIright, Mi-ran.

220
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,476
What should I write for you?

221
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,010
I want you.

222
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:04,618
What?

223
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:09,023
Write, "I want you."

224
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,618
OK, then.

225
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:31,041
I want to be your model.

226
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,148
That's ridiculous.

227
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,857
You're telling me that
she seduced you first?

228
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:45,653
Yes, it was seduction.

229
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:48,560
A seduction nobody could refuse.

230
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:56,368
The Mi-ran I know
is not that type of girl.

231
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,509
I decided to be bold
with her seduction.

232
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,733
If you're ready,
shall we get started?

233
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,439
Yes.

234
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,811
You don't have to
take off the skirt.

235
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,623
Would you go up
there and sit down?

236
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,336
Wait.

237
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,196
Try to be steady.

238
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:20,517
Just relax.

239
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:39,228
Hold on a second.

240
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,385
The more we did
the bolder she became.

241
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:19,797
That's how our Iove started becoming
stronger than anyone else's in this world.

242
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:30,005
She made me excited
over and over.

243
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:36,205
We made Iove again and again.

244
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,206
We didn't want to stop,

245
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,811
I could have died with her.
When I made Iove to her.

246
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,636
Don't Iie to me.

247
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:21,649
Stop interrupting.

248
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:24,852
That makes no sense at all!

249
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:31,160
Every moment with her
is still vivid to me.

250
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,358
PIease.

251
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,662
Why did you break up
with her then?

252
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,464
Why didn't you just marry her?

253
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:48,674
We didn't break up.

254
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,078
We swore that we would
Iove each other forever.

255
00:40:56,153 --> 00:41:01,318
We truly wanted our
Iove to be eternal.

256
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:10,028
If you Iove someone, do you
have to marry that person?

257
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,239
You're making all this up.

258
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:29,050
The Mi-ran I know isn't
some easy woman!

259
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:15,522
To me, she's pure and mysterious,
as if she came from a mythical tale.

260
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:22,734
She's a creation who Iooks as
if she jumped out of a painting.

261
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,622
Human beings will have to
face death eventually.

262
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,227
we Iive with the dilemma
that we dream of eternity.

263
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:31,832
So we desire to capture
the beauty at the peak of it.

264
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:39,748
We always desire to
be more beautiful.

265
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:47,656
Every art piece begins from this.

266
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:54,461
That's all for this semester.

267
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:58,763
Good work everyone.

268
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,205
Hey, excuse me!

269
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:11,305
- Excuse me!
- Me?

270
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:19,812
- You're in a dance major, right?
- Yes, what's up?

271
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:23,724
I saw you dancing before.

272
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:26,126
Okay.

273
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:30,528
I want to draw you dancing.

274
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:36,038
Why would you want to draw me?

275
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:38,841
Because you're special.

276
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,639
Special?

277
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:47,147
That sounds nice. Wait.

278
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,344
- Professor.
- Yes?

279
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,357
Would you sign this to celebrate
the end of the semester?

280
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,149
Sure.

281
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:05,392
What's your name?
Mi-ran. Oh Mi-ran, right?

282
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:06,401
Yes.

283
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:17,509
- Here.
- Thank you.

284
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,214
"I want you."

285
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:26,313
Can we talk? Just for a minute.

286
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:33,520
I was just wondering
if you'd be my model.

287
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:36,725
- It's nothing too difficult.
- Could you hold on a second?

288
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:39,626
It won't take too Iong.

289
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:47,541
You took her away
in the dirtiest way.

290
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:11,792
You put her in the corner
with a dirty trick.

291
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:51,234
You destroyed her with this
disgusting excuse you call 'art'.

292
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,833
Why don't you just
write a novel? Huh?

293
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:58,245
You are distorting the past

294
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:01,578
in order to beautify your work.

295
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:08,482
I think you are the one who is
twisted out of the memories.

296
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:10,492
That's not true.

297
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:17,795
Well, I can relate to you.

298
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:23,699
You Ioved Mi-ran but
couldn't have her all.

299
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:28,401
The jealousy towards me
with the desire for her.

300
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:32,607
Your memories could
be completely twisted.

301
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:38,714
You can say whatever you want.

302
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,120
But you can't avoid the fact.

303
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:49,029
So you fooled her completely

304
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,527
for your own good.

305
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:52,728
Shut up!

306
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:58,141
If you Ioved her to the death,
how could you Ieave her?

307
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:00,770
I said I didn't Ieave her!

308
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:07,476
Was she too much to handle
since she was too young?

309
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:12,980
Or you slept with

310
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,490
a young student impulsively.

311
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,392
But felt sorryfor her suddenly?

312
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:09,077
Professor.

313
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,582
Did you do well on your exam?

314
00:49:15,652 --> 00:49:17,586
- Yes.
- Hello, Professor

315
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:20,987
- Just a minute.
- I missed you.

316
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:23,385
Should we go get
something to eat?

317
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,287
I was worried didn't
get the Ietters yet.

318
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,992
- When did you Ieave it there?
- About a week ago.

319
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,002
Why aren't you saying
anything else?

320
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:39,008
You agree with me, don't you?

321
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:49,809
I won't deny what you're saying.

322
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:55,019
But that wasn't the problem.

323
00:49:55,792 --> 00:50:00,820
Age wasn't a problem
for us either.

324
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:41,662
As time went by, we only
sought physical pleasure.

325
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,456
Professor,

326
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:50,161
aren't you getting married?

327
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:10,617
A son and a daughter.
They Iook happy.

328
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:17,826
Why do you think people get
married and have babies?

329
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:24,834
That's because a man has met
an overly determined woman.

330
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:27,035
When a man marries,

331
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:29,731
it's because he's met the most cruel
and spiteful woman on earth.

332
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,642
No way,

333
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:37,337
then is your mother one of them?

334
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,597
How about we just Iive together?

335
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,010
We don't need marriage.

336
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,310
I don't want to crawl
into a grave of Iove

337
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:18,020
because of traditions
and any convenience.

338
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:27,029
Well, Mi-ran, it may not be easy
for you to understand now.

339
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:37,839
The Iust for a woman
reborn through my work,

340
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:41,138
I naturally fall in Iove
with the woman.

341
00:54:42,712 --> 00:54:47,649
But on the other hand, I couldn't see
the passion in my work.

342
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:50,850
It started to diminish.

343
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:22,702
I got addicted to her continuously

344
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:28,703
and so did she.

345
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:08,675
How's Natali?

346
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:41,408
Ten years Iater, I would
compare myself to Natali.

347
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:16,482
She promised me

348
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:22,685
she would come back
ten years Iater and Ieft me.

349
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:40,005
I blamed myself for not being
able to hold her back.

350
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:05,023
So, you ended up Ieaving Mi-ran.

351
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:14,434
Are you expecting her to appear
today Iooking Iike an angel?

352
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,444
Then, why isn't she here?

353
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:24,343
Your Iove just Iingers
in your fantasy.

354
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:29,457
You are irresponsible immature person
who can't break into reality.

355
01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:35,053
Mi-ran might have forgotten you.

356
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:41,065
Love might just end before
it reaches a decade.

357
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,767
Don't interpret it for
your own convenience.

358
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,078
You.

359
01:00:57,353 --> 01:01:02,723
Why are you still obsessed with
your one-sided Iove from the past?

360
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:08,322
I probably think I was the only hope

361
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:12,834
for miserable Mi-ran after you Ieft her.

362
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:25,040
I couldn't see Mi-ran even

363
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,838
when she completely came to me.

364
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:25,126
Do you think you know
her better than I do?

365
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:30,836
I know her very well.

366
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,546
Since she is my wife.

367
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:49,056
What?

368
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:07,501
A wife!

369
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:00,793
I've been Iooking for
you since Iast week.

370
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:04,790
What's going on with you?

371
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:17,807
Do you Iove me?

372
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:21,113
Yes.

373
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:24,209
Really?

374
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:34,027
Min-woo.

375
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:45,439
Even though someone else is in
my heart, can you still Iove me?

376
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:52,045
Yes.

377
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:54,341
Forever?

378
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:57,650
Yes, forever.

379
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,625
She promised eternal Iove.

380
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:49,435
This is ridiculous.

381
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:04,684
When I was at a Ioss in sorrow.

382
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:14,394
She did eat, sleep and
have sex with you.

383
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:26,200
Why the hell did you come to me?

384
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:28,700
Why did you?

385
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:36,411
If you didn't come,

386
01:07:39,088 --> 01:07:44,116
I would have been missing
her for the rest of my Iife.

387
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:51,430
Did she send you or did she
ask you to bring Natali?

388
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:00,575
Get out of my face now.

389
01:08:03,045 --> 01:08:06,071
Give Natali to me.

390
01:08:06,148 --> 01:08:06,978
No.

391
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:12,578
- I can't do that.
- She's my wife.

392
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:21,290
Natali is just one of the easy women
that I have spent a night with.

393
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:26,398
Does it make you feel better to objectify
Natali in a cheap and shameful way?

394
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:34,205
Yes, I should give away that
meaningless steel to someone

395
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,006
That's enough!

396
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:42,612
Tell your wife,

397
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:50,318
that my past, my work, my promises,
I take it all back and I regret everything.

398
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:54,720
- I wouldn't be able to.
- Go and tell her.

399
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:57,728
Don't Ieave out a single word.

400
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:03,968
Natali is a dirty and cheap whore.

401
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:06,769
- You hear me?
- That's enough!

402
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:09,775
I won't deliver a single
word you said.

403
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:19,987
Why? Why won't you?
Why! Why! Why!

404
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:22,985
Because...

405
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:26,493
Mi-ran...

406
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:29,688
Mi-ran...

407
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:34,092
is gone.

408
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:08,627
Mi-ran, Oh Mi-ran!

409
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:11,332
How could you say that?

410
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:12,339
Oh Mi-ran.

411
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:26,050
No, this is my first baby.
I'm going to have it.

412
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:27,850
This would kill you.

413
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:35,153
Honey, please...

414
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:42,069
No, I can't Iet you.
If I don't have you, I'II die.

415
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:45,265
We can always have
another baby.

416
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:52,070
Who's going to die?

417
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:56,681
I won't.

418
01:10:58,354 --> 01:10:59,480
Mi-ran wanted to have Ye-rim.

419
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:01,113
I will be fine.

420
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:08,420
If we didn't have her,
Mi-ran could've Iived.

421
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:16,833
In the end, as Mi-ran wanted,
we stopped Chemo treatment.

422
01:11:18,307 --> 01:11:23,643
And we were able to have
our healthy daughter, Ye-rim.

423
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:40,856
Are you all right?

424
01:11:42,231 --> 01:11:43,459
Yeah.

425
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:51,470
Come here, Ye-rim.

426
01:11:56,945 --> 01:12:00,813
Mi-ran had ovarian cancer.

427
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:04,109
Ye-rim.

428
01:12:04,687 --> 01:12:06,712
After she had Ye-rim,

429
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,422
the cancer spread all over her body
so we couldn't do nothing about it.

430
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:16,729
But I think Mi-ran was not afraid.

431
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:21,030
Are you awake, baby?

432
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:34,246
I'm fine.

433
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,347
Hold me tight.

434
01:12:53,535 --> 01:13:01,806
You know, the doctor said
I can have sex.

435
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:10,717
I'm sorry. Honey.

436
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:23,822
Honey.

437
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:35,841
I Iove you.

438
01:13:36,812 --> 01:13:38,040
What?

439
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,042
I said I Iove you.

440
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:49,254
Me too. I Iove you, too.

441
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:41,422
I had no idea.

442
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,428
Natali

443
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:53,536
must be meaningful than
any of your work for you.

444
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:18,792
Can you forgive me? PIease.

445
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:23,995
Forgive me. PIease.

446
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:31,311
Mi-ran

447
01:17:35,784 --> 01:17:38,014
tried to keep her words
until the end.

448
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:46,521
She waited for you
until the very Iast moment.

449
01:17:53,101 --> 01:18:00,564
Right before she passed away
I found this out by accident.

450
01:19:21,656 --> 01:19:26,093
Why, why did you do this? Why!

451
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:51,213
She missed you.
Until the Iast moment.

452
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:13,836
This is the Ietter she Ieft for you.

453
01:20:36,131 --> 01:20:38,861
We have to see each other.

454
01:20:40,635 --> 01:20:47,666
I don't think I can keep my promise
seeing you after ten years from now.

455
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:53,076
If I could see you just once.

456
01:20:54,649 --> 01:20:56,480
I want to say this to you.

457
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:15,625
Do you know what she
was going to tell me?

458
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:22,042
No, I am curious too.
That's why I came to see you.

459
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:40,053
You said you have a daughter.

460
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:48,364
Will you bring her sometime?

461
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:51,355
I missed you.

462
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:43,634
It doesn't matter what
she was going to say.

463
01:24:44,712 --> 01:24:51,049
In the way as I always wanted to.
I will Iove you Mi-ran.

464
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:55,546
Even though it will
take an eternity,

465
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:58,854
I will come to you.

466
01:25:01,062 --> 01:25:05,999
Hope this mail box will
take me to you Mi-ran.
