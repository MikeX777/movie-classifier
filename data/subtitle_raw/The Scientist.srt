00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:46,047
It's
December 9th, 2022.

3
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:49,017
I'm Dr. Steve Unger.

4
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:53,955
Here, we have
patient number one,

5
00:00:55,123 --> 00:00:59,393
female, mid-20s to late 20s,

6
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,030
no vital signs.

7
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:05,233
Cause of death...

8
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:09,037
Strangulation.

9
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,874
I will administer
five milliliters

10
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,511
of test batch alpha,

11
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,349
the results of which
should yield...

12
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,752
Life.

13
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:54,182
Please.

14
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:56,951
Let this one.

15
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:28,976
She's alive!

16
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,852
It's such a beautiful place.

17
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,625
Wow, look at that!

18
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,963
That moth is so amazing.

19
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,201
The moth's a great mimic.

20
00:05:02,203 --> 00:05:03,835
To hide from predators, the moth

21
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,906
can evolve to look like insects,

22
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:11,245
such as a wasp or,
even the tarantula.

23
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:15,981
Okay, are you telling me that

24
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,385
can turn into a tarantula?

25
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,388
Yes.

26
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:22,354
Hey, look it up in the Internet

27
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:23,557
if you don't believe me.

28
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:26,794
So gross,

29
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:28,996
yet oddly beautiful.

30
00:05:32,433 --> 00:05:34,200
What if people
were like moths,

31
00:05:34,202 --> 00:05:37,305
and this body of ours
was only the beginning?

32
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:40,941
What do you mean?

33
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:44,978
Okay.

34
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,647
Well, before it becomes a moth,

35
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,317
a caterpillar has this
transformative cells

36
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,520
hidden within its body.

37
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,756
And once it enters the cocoon,

38
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:59,491
those transformative
cells are released

39
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:03,495
and they can become whatever
it needs to survive.

40
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:04,630
Who knows?

41
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:07,333
Maybe we have those same

42
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:10,168
transformative cells within us.

43
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,973
And all we need to
do is wake them up,

44
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:17,243
then we can turn into
some strange creature.

45
00:06:22,082 --> 00:06:24,084
But I think, I think I'm,

46
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,953
I think I'm turning
into one now.

47
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:31,559
I'm uh, uh, uh.

48
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:35,527
What?

49
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,931
I'm coming for
you now, Darlene.

50
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,001
Coming for you, Darlene.

51
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,803
Oh!

52
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:23,210
Darlene,

53
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,144
I have loved you

54
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,181
since the first moment
I've ever saw you.

55
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:34,152
I'm no poet but
this is as romantic

56
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,756
as I thought it was in my head.

57
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,595
You've been so patient
with me after med school.

58
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,264
You stood by my side when

59
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,635
I couldn't even stand
to be by myself.

60
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:52,938
I can't imagine spending
the rest of my life

61
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,375
with anyone else but you.

62
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:58,045
I promise to love you,

63
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:00,848
cherish you,

64
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,451
support you,

65
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,454
and care for you.

66
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:10,290
I will absolutely treasure you

67
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,565
forever and ever if you
promise to marry me.

68
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,340
Darlene, will you marry me?

69
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:33,645
Yes, of course.

70
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:17,556
Are there any side effects

71
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,425
that we should know about?

72
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:20,561
She'll be tired.

73
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,997
The pain medication will
help with the headaches.

74
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:28,235
The shot I'll administer
will help with the nausea.

75
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,472
You'll feel a
little pinch, okay?

76
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,478
As a hospice nurse,

77
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,015
I'm here not only for your wife,

78
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,783
but your entire family

79
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,420
till the last
stages of her life.

80
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,691
You mentioned you have
a daughter, correct?

81
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:54,995
Lily.

82
00:09:56,497 --> 00:09:57,297
Lily.

83
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,500
That's a beautiful name.

84
00:10:01,502 --> 00:10:02,335
Thank you.

85
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,704
I'll help you and Lily

86
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,074
get through this process.

87
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,775
I'll make sure your wife

88
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:11,445
is as comfortable as possible.

89
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,516
Now, I've laid
out some pamphlets

90
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:20,020
that detail everything from
symptoms to be aware of,

91
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,524
as well as coping
with family stress.

92
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:28,259
Are there any other
family members

93
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,631
that should be present
for these conversations?

94
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,101
Her parents passed
away a while ago.

95
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,037
She has a brother,

96
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,974
but he is not much into family.

97
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,076
No worries.

98
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:47,481
What about your occupation?

99
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:53,485
I do research for
a cosmetics lab,

100
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:56,557
so my hours are pretty
much nine to five.

101
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:05,497
Just know
I'm here to help,

102
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,802
for as little or
as much possible.

103
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:20,311
It will help you
and your daughter

104
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,580
in this situation.

105
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:24,282
There's no timetable
when we can pinpoint

106
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:28,453
when your wife will slip
into a coma or pass.

107
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:31,623
It can be weeks, months,

108
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:34,194
so the sooner you address
these things, the better.

109
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,931
Do you have any
questions so far?

110
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:41,735
No.

111
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:47,407
But thank you, for
everything, Betty.

112
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:59,019
I promised to always
take care of you.

113
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,724
You are, more than enough.

114
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,025
Could've done something more

115
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,428
to prevent all this.

116
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:15,202
None of this is because
you failed at something.

117
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:23,143
I'm lucky to have married you.

118
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:29,983
From this home, and life,
to our beautiful daughter,

119
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:34,285
I'm blessed.

120
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,253
Mom!

121
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,089
Dad?

122
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,091
Speaking of.

123
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,661
In here, sweetie.

124
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:43,061
What are you all doing?

125
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,497
It isn't bedtime.

126
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,066
Of course not, sweetie.

127
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,736
Mommy is just a
little tired today.

128
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:52,270
You're always tired, mommy.

129
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,607
That's nothing new.

130
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:56,908
Hey, why don't you tell us

131
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,177
what you did in school today?

132
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,347
Stars.

133
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:02,883
Stars?

134
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,451
What about the stars?

135
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,854
There are bi-gillion,
million of stars in the sky

136
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:11,089
and the sun is a big star.

137
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,724
That's right.

138
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:13,560
Good job.

139
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,630
Can we look at
the stars tonight?

140
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,733
We'll need to let
mommy take a nap.

141
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:25,070
And then, we can look
at the stars later.

142
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:25,906
Okay?

143
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:30,477
Sweet dreams, mommy.

144
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:41,286
Hey, kiddo.

145
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,154
How would you feel about

146
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,923
two of us taking a trip?

147
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,057
Just us two.

148
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,027
Where?

149
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:51,362
- Where do you want?
- New Mexico.

150
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:52,798
It's odd.

151
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,132
Why New Mexico?

152
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,834
My teacher's from
there and she said

153
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:58,038
you can see tons of stars.

154
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,842
All right then, New Mexico.

155
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,511
How come mommy wanna come?

156
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,450
Well, mommy is
not gonna be able

157
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,753
to do everything with us.

158
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:16,990
Sometimes, it's just
gonna be you and me.

159
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,427
How do you feel about that?

160
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:23,396
About what?

161
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,433
If it was just you and me.

162
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:29,602
My friend at
school has two dads.

163
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:34,072
Okay, but I don't think
you'll gonna another dad,

164
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:39,079
but what about a dad and a mom?

165
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,182
No, that would be weird.

166
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,052
Yeah.

167
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,485
Come on.

168
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:49,287
Let's go wake up mom
for dinner, okay?

169
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:24,990
Okay, here.

170
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:27,425
Put this on, it's a
little cold outside.

171
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,295
Where's mom?

172
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,997
Mom is still asleep.

173
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,464
Still?

174
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,534
Lazy mom.

175
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:39,838
Your mom needs a lot of
sleep these days, okay?

176
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,074
- Okay.
- All right.

177
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:44,111
Go get your backpack.

178
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,384
And this must be Lily.

179
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,888
Lily, this is Betty.

180
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,555
She's gonna make
mommy feel better

181
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:58,859
when we're away from home.

182
00:15:59,827 --> 00:16:01,028
Nice to meet you, Lily.

183
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:03,962
Are you gonna help my
mom with her headaches

184
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,799
and from getting
tired all the time?

185
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,168
Well, I'm gonna try.

186
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,070
We'll see, okay?

187
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:12,670
You're off to school?

188
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,572
Yeah, my
dad walks me everyday

189
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,441
before he goes to work.

190
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,243
Well, that's nice of him.

191
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:19,544
Such a good daddy he is.

192
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:22,313
Hm, I think, yes, he's okay.

193
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,550
Hey!

194
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,485
Darlene's inside asleep.

195
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,254
You have the code to get in?

196
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:30,488
I do.

197
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,957
Well, you have a good day,

198
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:35,060
and maybe, after
school, I'll meet you

199
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:37,097
with some freshly baked cookies.

200
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,200
- I like her.
- Mm-hm.

201
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:43,801
Come on, all right.

202
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,071
Bye, thanks, Betty.

203
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:57,450
Steve.

204
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:00,854
Amigo.

205
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:09,462
Are you all right?

206
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,733
Let me show you this.

207
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:22,775
Steve, this...

208
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,278
This looks promising.

209
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,613
Are these using the
stem cell samples

210
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:29,616
we got in yesterday?

211
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,184
I tried a different approach

212
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,053
from our previous attempts.

213
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,793
I definitely see a lot
of cell regeneration there.

214
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,433
But I think we should
show it to Dr. Berry.

215
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,073
You used the neural
stem cell samples

216
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,709
we received from St. Louis?

217
00:17:58,045 --> 00:17:59,577
Yes, sir.

218
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,513
Just the neural?

219
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,352
Well, actually,

220
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:08,956
I added embryonic cells as well.

221
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:14,861
Robert,

222
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:19,332
let me talk to Steve,

223
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:22,102
alone.

224
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:35,981
Where the fuck did you
get the embryonic cells?

225
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:38,416
We received the package
from St. Louis that contained

226
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:41,186
both the neural and the
embryonic stem cells.

227
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,553
So, you just up and decided

228
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,958
to research with them
without my approval?

229
00:18:46,093 --> 00:18:47,194
You like having a job?

230
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:49,396
Making money?

231
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,165
I don't know where you're
planning to go with this.

232
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:57,802
Stop wasting my fucking
time trying to play savior,

233
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,637
by creating cures for diseases

234
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,208
we have no business treating.

235
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,742
I make money to run this place,

236
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:07,778
pay you a salary by
developing cosmetic therapies

237
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,514
to sell to the rich
people in America,

238
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:12,150
who have the money to
pay for these treatments.

239
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,419
Yeah, and we can
continue to do that.

240
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,287
But we could also develop

241
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,889
groundbreaking treatments
for lots of diseases.

242
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,360
We have the capacity.

243
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,262
You develop a
cure for, let's say,

244
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:27,265
something small, chicken pox.

245
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:28,733
Great!

246
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,835
No kid in America ever
catches the disease again

247
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,172
and it becomes obsolete.

248
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,875
Guess who needs to buy
your medication now.

249
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:37,744
Nobody.

250
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,445
And how much do you make

251
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:42,582
when nobody needs
your medication?

252
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:45,985
Not a goddamn cent.

253
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,756
There is never going to
be a cure for cellulite

254
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,460
as long as people enjoy eating.

255
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,661
The goddamn Russian scientists
are testing on humans

256
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,029
and making a killing.

257
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,330
It's all I wanna do here,

258
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:00,867
and make you and I some money.

259
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:04,835
Focus on the task I give you

260
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,306
and you keep your job.

261
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:11,576
Yes, sir.

262
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,680
Think of your daughter.

263
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,764
So, what did he say?

264
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:34,867
Nothing.

265
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:39,139
Just wants me to keep making
plastic faces for rich people.

266
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:42,742
Look, Steve, I'm with you.

267
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:46,779
Yeah, I wish our jobs were
more rewarding than they are.

268
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,450
But it's a job, man.

269
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:52,852
I'm sorry about Darlene.

270
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:55,955
I pray for your
family every night.

271
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,059
But it truly is in
God's hands, my friend.

272
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,565
You know one thing
he said that was right?

273
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,399
As long as people keep
getting rich off medications,

274
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:10,670
then there's no
incentive to find a cure.

275
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,671
They'll say, "Keep
the sick medicated,

276
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:15,408
"keep the profits rolling then."

277
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,843
Something there's got
to change, all right?

278
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:22,215
Our health care system,
they're robbing us blind.

279
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,550
We're just getting
played by the system.

280
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:28,085
I mean, as scientist,
it's our responsibility

281
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:29,654
to find a fix.

282
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:32,290
If we don't, then
nothing will ever change.

283
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,725
I agree but there are rules,

284
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:36,261
morals that we have to abide by,

285
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:38,296
and if we don't, then
we're no different.

286
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,132
Are we?

287
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,337
Hey, I'll keep praying
for both of us.

288
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,274
And give Darlene my best, huh?

289
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:07,585
It's 90 degrees
outside and it's December,

290
00:23:07,587 --> 00:23:10,054
and they tell us global
warming isn't real.

291
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,290
I know this is
Texas but come on.

292
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:14,959
Well, moving on to
something that is real,

293
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:17,495
did you hear about
this strange story?

294
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,964
An eight-year-old
boy bitten by a wasp

295
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:22,867
while vacationing with
his parents in Costa Rica

296
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:25,069
returned home deathly sick,

297
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:28,339
but within a few days,
recovered from his illness,

298
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:31,609
and miraculously cured
from a lifelong battle

299
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:34,178
of his multiple
sclerosis disease.

300
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,513
Isn't that amazing?

301
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:38,716
However, weeks after
his stunning recovery,

302
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:42,653
the boy slipped into a
coma and eventually died.

303
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:45,923
Doctors are still puzzled
about his miraculous recovery

304
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,625
and are trying to understand

305
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:49,894
more about the boy's illness.

306
00:23:49,896 --> 00:23:52,397
They've sent cell
sample to various labs

307
00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:53,631
- across the state...
- Sorry.

308
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:54,899
For
further research

309
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:56,901
in the hopes to learn
more and possibly find...

310
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:58,403
- Sorry.
- A cure for MS.

311
00:23:58,405 --> 00:24:00,907
Have a nice day.

312
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:05,412
Daddy!

313
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,815
He-hey!

314
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:10,781
How's my little one?

315
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,386
- Good.
- Good.

316
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:18,022
Uh, oh, what's going on in here?

317
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:20,558
Well, good
evening, Mr. Unger.

318
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,192
Just Steve is fine.

319
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,630
Good evening, Steve.

320
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:25,565
Hey.

321
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:29,534
Hey, how are you feeling?

322
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:31,001
Good.

323
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:33,671
Betty just waited a
bit until you got home.

324
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,706
She cooked dinner for us.

325
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,475
Oh, that was nice.

326
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:38,709
Thank you, Betty.

327
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,445
It's no problem at all.

328
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:44,214
I even made Miss Lily some
homemade mac and cheese.

329
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,516
Yummy, right?

330
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:48,218
A lot better than that
bug stuff you make, dad.

331
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,219
No offense.

332
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,391
- Oh.
- Oh, no offense, huh?

333
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:54,827
The things they teach
kids in school these days.

334
00:24:56,629 --> 00:24:58,295
Well, I better get going.

335
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:00,264
You guys enjoy the dinner.

336
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:01,067
Bye, Lily.

337
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:04,769
Hey, Betty, why
don't you stay?

338
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:07,805
That is, unless you
have other dinner plans.

339
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:10,510
I can't say this single
woman has any plans.

340
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:13,913
So, Lily, do you mind if I stay?

341
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:24,056
Do you have kids, Betty?

342
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,124
No, I don't.

343
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:27,960
Why?

344
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:33,099
God didn't bless
me with the ability to.

345
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,066
Why would God do that?

346
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:38,969
Lily, it's not nice to ask
personal questions like that.

347
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,640
No, it's okay.

348
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:46,110
God has a
plan for all of us.

349
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:50,216
And we all play a role
in each other's lives.

350
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:56,086
And besides, I'm here to help
with you and your family.

351
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:59,490
Help us make yummy mac
and cheese and cookies?

352
00:25:59,492 --> 00:26:00,791
Exactly.

353
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:33,439
So, what have you discovered?

354
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:37,143
A fix.

355
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,191
No, no, this isn't right.

356
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,664
Wait, wait,
what isn't right about it?

357
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,932
You're tampering
with human DNA here.

358
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:04,401
I mean, you're
regenerating cells faster

359
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:06,305
than anything I've
ever seen possible.

360
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,540
How did you even do this?

361
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:12,542
You remember those cell
samples we got from St. Louis?

362
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,747
Yeah, the ones you
showed me the other day.

363
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:18,015
Yeah, well, those
samples contained the cells

364
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:20,584
of an eight-year-old boy
who died from a disease

365
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:23,022
contracted from a wasp
bite in Costa Rica.

366
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,757
But before he died,
that same disease

367
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,559
cured his multiple sclerosis.

368
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,995
Right, so there's
something there

369
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:32,429
that we could tap into.

370
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:34,233
I am close to getting it.

371
00:30:36,703 --> 00:30:38,237
This is dangerous stuff, man.

372
00:30:39,405 --> 00:30:41,371
Yo don't know what
this can do long-term.

373
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:43,741
We don't even do that
kind of research here.

374
00:30:43,743 --> 00:30:45,175
But we have them now, okay?

375
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,846
We could something
of this, okay?

376
00:30:49,982 --> 00:30:51,749
We run a test.

377
00:30:51,751 --> 00:30:55,119
We inject the virus and
follow it up with this serum.

378
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:59,623
And we could come very
close to finding a cure.

379
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:00,492
A cure for what?

380
00:31:02,795 --> 00:31:03,763
For anything.

381
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:06,098
Everything.

382
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,601
Can you even imagine
what that would be like?

383
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:13,804
I know why you're doing this.

384
00:31:13,806 --> 00:31:15,405
Okay, I get it.

385
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,474
But even if you did go
through with any of this,

386
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:19,710
this would never pass
through any FDA regulations.

387
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:21,447
Who or how would you even test?

388
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:25,615
We don't even have
that authority here.

389
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,384
I mean, look at these mutations

390
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,088
that are occurring
in this sample.

391
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,957
You can't fathom
the consequences

392
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,493
that could result from testing.

393
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:40,330
Walk away from this.

394
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:07,226
I'm really sorry I missed
your dance recital, Lily.

395
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:16,202
I've been working really
hard to make mommy better.

396
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,906
And you do want mommy to
get better, don't you?

397
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:30,714
You know, Betty, I really
can't thank you enough

398
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:33,183
for everything that you've been

399
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:35,254
doing around here,
all your help.

400
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:38,555
I can't even imagine what life

401
00:32:38,557 --> 00:32:40,126
would be like here without you.

402
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:43,495
You're welcome.

403
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:56,273
Did you all eat dinner?

404
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:57,676
Yeah, we did.

405
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:00,878
Are you hungry?

406
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,948
Mm, no.

407
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,651
No, just tired.

408
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:11,623
This medication
makes me so sleepy.

409
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:22,967
Sorry for
being mad at you.

410
00:33:22,969 --> 00:33:24,935
Are you mad at me?

411
00:33:24,937 --> 00:33:26,939
- Before.
- When?

412
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:30,674
Forgetting me at
dance rehearsal.

413
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:31,510
Hey.

414
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:35,347
I didn't forget about you.

415
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:37,516
I was just late.

416
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,117
I know.

417
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:42,819
I need to be more tough and
not such a baby anymore.

418
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:46,058
I know mom is sick and we
need to be tough for her.

419
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:51,297
I made this for you to
protect us from being sick.

420
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:53,832
You promise to wear it?

421
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:57,937
I'll never take it off.

422
00:34:02,008 --> 00:34:03,373
Good night, sweetheart.

423
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,144
Sweet dreams, daddy.

424
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:25,932
Earth to Steve.

425
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:31,203
Hey, beautiful.

426
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:44,314
Did your work allow you to

427
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:46,418
take all this equipment
home with you?

428
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:51,457
I think borrow would be
a better word than take.

429
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:06,436
So what are you so
obsessed with out here

430
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:09,339
that I don't see you as much?

431
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,377
I've had a breakthrough
in my research.

432
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:15,081
I just need to dedicate
more time to it.

433
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:20,119
Look, I promise, I'm
going to fix you.

434
00:35:22,021 --> 00:35:23,787
I'm so close...

435
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:24,955
- Steve.
- To finally finding...

436
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,290
Steve!

437
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:28,892
Steve, all I want
is you and Lily

438
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:32,231
to spend whatever
time is left, with me.

439
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,835
It's too away for
any of this, Steve.

440
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:39,503
No.

441
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:41,840
I'll make more time.

442
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:45,377
Look, all I have to
do is perfect it.

443
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:47,813
And it might...

444
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:52,484
No, it will cure you.

445
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:54,920
I just have to hurry

446
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:58,991
because I won't lose you.

447
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:06,530
Okay,
I understand that,

448
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:09,866
that this is your way of
dealing with the situation,

449
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:10,936
to fix it.

450
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:14,273
But I don't you to fix me.

451
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:19,609
I need you to just
lay down with me

452
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:22,281
and accept this, together,

453
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:28,054
'cause I'm trying to keep
it together.

454
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:31,123
I'm scared.

455
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:37,329
I'm scared of not
leaving a perfect home.

456
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:43,069
I'm scared of,

457
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:47,106
I'm scared of Lily
growing up with anger.

458
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:51,475
I'm scared of you being lonely

459
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:52,778
for the rest of your life.

460
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:58,748
But also of not remembering me

461
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,985
if you do move on.

462
00:37:01,087 --> 00:37:03,755
No.

463
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,256
No.

464
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:08,325
No, that's not gonna happen.

465
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:10,496
No, it's not gonna happen.

466
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,330
You wanna know why?

467
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:16,402
Because you are
not going anywhere.

468
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:22,272
You're gonna stay right
here with me, forever.

469
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:23,075
All right?

470
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:26,712
- I love you.
- I love you.

471
00:38:39,518 --> 00:38:42,721
Today is December 6, 2022.

472
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:45,922
I'm Dr. Steven Unger,

473
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:48,794
and today I will proceed
with the first test

474
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:54,700
of batch alpha on
subject A, mouse.

475
00:38:56,768 --> 00:39:00,672
Subject A is free of
ailment and disease,

476
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,843
so I will administer
a lethal virus,

477
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:07,811
and upon death,
will then administer

478
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:11,815
two milliliters of
test batch alpha,

479
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:14,851
the results of
which should return

480
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16,922
subject A back to life.

481
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:04,970
Subject A is now deceased.

482
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:12,642
So, I'll administer two
milliliters test batch alpha.

483
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:08,667
My god.

484
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:21,480
After two-milliliter
dosage of test batch alpha,

485
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:28,952
subject A has returned to life.

486
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:36,027
All bodily functions
appear normal.

487
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,980
Dad, it's mom!

488
00:41:56,982 --> 00:41:57,783
Dad!

489
00:42:00,486 --> 00:42:01,953
Dad, help, please!

490
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,092
Dad, mom needs help, quick!

491
00:42:07,993 --> 00:42:12,998
Dad!

492
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,267
What's going on?

493
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,204
Daddy, what's going on?

494
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,208
Daddy, please answer me.

495
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,809
Daddy!

496
00:42:25,811 --> 00:42:28,111
- Go wait in the living room.
- Daddy.

497
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:46,843
What
are you, crazy fucker?

498
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:49,679
Why are you fucking
with me like that?

499
00:45:49,681 --> 00:45:52,716
You try that shit again,
I'll kick some ass.

500
00:47:03,822 --> 00:47:06,892
I'll be okay, if
you could fix her.

501
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:14,733
For a long as you can fix her.

502
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:58,107
I've always hated the
name my mom gave me.

503
00:47:58,109 --> 00:47:59,976
Minerva.

504
00:47:59,978 --> 00:48:01,947
I mean, what is that?

505
00:48:03,248 --> 00:48:04,716
But my mom, the
hippie,

506
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:08,885
so, it was just like
her to name someone

507
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:10,453
something so a lot.

508
00:48:10,455 --> 00:48:12,621
That's why people
call me Minnie,

509
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:13,624
because I'm so tiny.

510
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:19,062
But, I mean, I think I'm
starting to like it a little bit.

511
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:24,002
I looked it up and it
means goddess of wisdom.

512
00:48:25,336 --> 00:48:27,136
That's not too bad, right?

513
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:27,973
It's kinda cool.

514
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:32,543
So...

515
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:38,049
Are you gonna kiss me, or what?

516
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:51,429
I'm sorry.

517
00:49:24,195 --> 00:49:25,530
Shh, shh, shh.

518
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:34,303
Shh, shh, shh.

519
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:35,839
Quiet!

520
00:49:35,841 --> 00:49:37,073
Shh, shh.

521
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:40,243
Quiet!

522
00:49:40,245 --> 00:49:41,510
Let's get to the car.

523
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:42,347
Hurry!

524
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:49,454
Shut up!

525
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:26,950
No, no, no no.

526
00:51:26,952 --> 00:51:29,718
No, no, no, no, no, wake up.

527
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,122
Come on, wake up.

528
00:51:31,957 --> 00:51:33,556
Wake up, wake up, don't.

529
00:51:33,558 --> 00:51:34,991
No, no, no.

530
00:51:34,993 --> 00:51:36,094
No, don't go.

531
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,473
Damn!

532
00:53:03,581 --> 00:53:05,916
What are you doing, daddy?

533
00:53:08,453 --> 00:53:10,153
Get out of here, Lily.

534
00:53:10,155 --> 00:53:12,190
This isn't a place
to be playing around.

535
00:53:35,146 --> 00:53:38,414
You need some help with that?

536
00:53:38,416 --> 00:53:40,116
No, thanks.

537
00:53:40,118 --> 00:53:41,719
I'm just taking
out some old trash.

538
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:44,687
Well, Lily came in crying.

539
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:46,591
I just want to see if
everything was okay.

540
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:49,358
Everything is okay.

541
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,195
I'm good.

542
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:53,731
That looks really heavy.

543
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:56,865
Yes.

544
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:57,668
I'm good.

545
00:54:00,205 --> 00:54:01,939
You should probably
go inside and,

546
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:05,343
see if Lily needs any help.

547
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,778
- Steve.
- What?

548
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:24,549
Oh, sorry.

549
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:27,716
Did I wake you?

550
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,357
Kiss me.

551
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:44,335
Kiss.

552
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:48,839
Kiss me.

553
00:56:50,675 --> 00:56:52,176
Kiss me right now.

554
00:56:54,779 --> 00:56:55,613
Kiss me.

555
00:56:56,447 --> 00:56:57,282
Kiss me.

556
00:56:58,549 --> 00:56:59,384
Kiss me.

557
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:54,705
You look tired.

558
00:58:00,177 --> 00:58:04,480
I'm not defeated.

559
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:07,151
Now that's what I'm afraid of.

560
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,855
Come lay with me.

561
00:58:33,778 --> 00:58:36,779
Promise me that whatever
it is you're doing,

562
00:58:36,781 --> 00:58:39,884
it won't jeopardize
everything we've built so far.

563
00:58:45,222 --> 00:58:46,223
I promise.

564
00:58:58,736 --> 00:58:59,870
How you feeling, kiddo?

565
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:11,749
Don't lose this one.

566
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:14,485
Yes, sorry.

567
00:59:15,686 --> 00:59:17,488
I must have misplaced
the other one.

568
00:59:18,689 --> 00:59:21,524
I promise to take good
care of this one, okay?

569
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:21,018
I can't keep
letting you do this.

570
01:00:26,857 --> 01:00:28,726
You can't play God.

571
01:00:33,831 --> 01:00:35,631
What are you gonna do?

572
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:36,501
Report me?

573
01:00:39,003 --> 01:00:40,302
Listen.

574
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:44,807
As a friend, I know
you're hurting, man.

575
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:46,074
You're trying everything

576
01:00:46,076 --> 01:00:47,375
that you can do
to help, but you...

577
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:51,446
Hey, you have no idea
what I am going through,

578
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:53,949
okay, because you do not
have the urgency that I have

579
01:00:53,951 --> 01:00:56,485
as a husband, as a father,
who'll do anything he can

580
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:57,653
to keep his family together.

581
01:00:57,655 --> 01:00:59,054
Not this way.

582
01:00:59,056 --> 01:01:00,656
Whatever you're doing
is not controlled.

583
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:01,592
It's not regulated.

584
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:05,127
I have to stop you.

585
01:01:08,533 --> 01:01:11,736
Stay out of it or
you're gonna get hurt.

586
01:01:18,308 --> 01:01:20,175
Stay out of it.

587
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:49,271
Police investigating
a missing person case

588
01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:51,640
are asking for
the public's help.

589
01:01:51,642 --> 01:01:53,609
The woman seen in this video,

590
01:01:53,611 --> 01:01:56,211
28-year-old Minerva Wilson,

591
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,413
was last seen walking
out of the bar

592
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:00,683
with this unidentified man.

593
01:02:00,685 --> 01:02:02,885
Police are asking
for the public's help

594
01:02:02,887 --> 01:02:04,720
on identifying this man,

595
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:07,191
or the whereabouts
of Minerva Wilson.

596
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:36,220
Steve?

597
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:40,557
Are you in there?

598
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:47,998
I'm going home for the evening.

599
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:52,970
Call me if you need me, okay?

600
01:04:28,498 --> 01:04:29,399
Steve?

601
01:04:32,703 --> 01:04:34,571
Yeah, I'm here.

602
01:04:41,645 --> 01:04:44,146
You should really get some rest.

603
01:04:44,148 --> 01:04:49,153
I know, I'm just, really
haven't seen you very much.

604
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:52,389
I know.

605
01:04:53,791 --> 01:04:58,428
Just promise me that
when things get closer,

606
01:04:59,596 --> 01:05:02,132
you'll just lay down
with me more, please.

607
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:06,470
Hey.

608
01:05:07,671 --> 01:05:10,808
There's gonna be plenty
of time for that later.

609
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:12,943
I promise.

610
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:15,880
All right?

611
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:59,623
Betty.

612
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:07,229
Come on, Betty.

613
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,065
Come on.

614
01:06:12,602 --> 01:06:13,768
Okay.

615
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:14,604
Okay.

616
01:09:15,952 --> 01:09:17,019
Dad?

617
01:09:17,021 --> 01:09:18,253
Are you in there?

618
01:09:18,255 --> 01:09:19,089
Hello?

619
01:09:27,064 --> 01:09:28,665
Who's in there, daddy?

620
01:09:29,933 --> 01:09:30,867
Nothing, sweetie.

621
01:09:32,102 --> 01:09:34,369
I've just got some
work in there.

622
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:35,670
I've got some
dangerous equipment

623
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,073
that I don't want you to touch.

624
01:09:38,075 --> 01:09:41,011
So don't ever go in there, okay?

625
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:42,746
Okay.

626
01:09:44,214 --> 01:09:46,381
Promise me, Lily.

627
01:09:46,383 --> 01:09:48,118
Never go in there.

628
01:09:49,186 --> 01:09:50,187
I promise.

629
01:09:51,588 --> 01:09:53,555
Good.

630
01:09:53,557 --> 01:09:56,460
All right, let's
get you to school.

631
01:11:25,115 --> 01:11:26,983
It's
fascinating, isn't it?

632
01:11:36,893 --> 01:11:38,295
What have you done, Steve?

633
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:41,131
You know how they
got the flu shot?

634
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:48,605
Neurologists in Michigan
in the early 40s

635
01:11:50,073 --> 01:11:52,540
deliberately infected patients

636
01:11:52,542 --> 01:11:54,911
at the mental hospital
with the influenza virus.

637
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,846
You know, there was
some trouble in there

638
01:11:58,848 --> 01:12:00,450
and dozens of death.

639
01:12:02,085 --> 01:12:02,919
Viola!

640
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:04,921
Got a vaccine.

641
01:12:08,124 --> 01:12:09,393
You know, I'm this close.

642
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:14,829
This close

643
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:17,401
to developing something
that will change the world.

644
01:12:18,602 --> 01:12:20,568
And people will look
back at all of this

645
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:23,205
and say that it was necessary

646
01:12:23,207 --> 01:12:26,243
to advance health, science,

647
01:12:27,377 --> 01:12:31,615
and sacrifices the
few to save the many.

648
01:12:35,118 --> 01:12:37,521
There'll be some
casualties along the way.

649
01:12:39,155 --> 01:12:40,422
But they are just as much a part

650
01:12:40,424 --> 01:12:43,126
of this discovery as I am.

651
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:47,464
You see that now?

652
01:12:50,033 --> 01:12:52,702
The work I'd do will save lives,

653
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:56,640
keep families together.

654
01:12:57,674 --> 01:12:59,543
It will end suffering.

655
01:13:01,445 --> 01:13:03,112
And you don't think
she's suffering?

656
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:08,552
She...

657
01:13:12,956 --> 01:13:15,825
She promised to help me

658
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:19,160
any way that she could.

659
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:21,798
She is helping me.

660
01:13:22,999 --> 01:13:24,668
She's helping my family!

661
01:13:25,669 --> 01:13:28,171
She's helping your family.

662
01:13:29,306 --> 01:13:32,509
She is helping millions
of others out there.

663
01:13:36,813 --> 01:13:37,814
I'll pray for you.

664
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:43,420
Well, save your prayer!

665
01:14:23,693 --> 01:14:27,061
Welcome back to the
land of the living.

666
01:14:27,063 --> 01:14:28,197
How are you feeling?

667
01:14:31,335 --> 01:14:33,036
I'm truly dying to know.

668
01:14:41,545 --> 01:14:45,246
You know, I always told
that I would succeed.

669
01:14:45,248 --> 01:14:48,550
You could have been
here, right alongside me,

670
01:14:48,552 --> 01:14:49,686
changing the world.

671
01:14:52,088 --> 01:14:54,190
It's too bad that you
won't get to see it.

672
01:15:11,608 --> 01:15:13,309
Sorry, you had to
see that, Betty.

673
01:15:14,878 --> 01:15:15,912
Really, I am.

674
01:15:18,882 --> 01:15:19,883
But don't worry.

675
01:15:21,651 --> 01:15:23,186
You won't suffer the same fate.

676
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:26,721
I promise.

677
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:25,769
Thank you, honey.

678
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:32,375
Where's Betty?

679
01:18:34,978 --> 01:18:35,912
I sent her home.

680
01:18:37,413 --> 01:18:40,183
We don't need nurses anymore.

681
01:18:43,553 --> 01:18:44,387
What's wrong?

682
01:18:45,722 --> 01:18:49,458
I don't know what.

683
01:18:51,961 --> 01:18:53,029
Betty's gone.

684
01:18:56,432 --> 01:18:58,802
I don't know what you're doing.

685
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:03,106
I don't know where Lily is.

686
01:19:04,073 --> 01:19:04,908
Hey.

687
01:19:06,309 --> 01:19:08,845
Honey, it's okay.

688
01:19:10,046 --> 01:19:12,649
Lily is in the other
room having dinner.

689
01:19:14,684 --> 01:19:16,319
Everything hurts.

690
01:19:18,554 --> 01:19:19,889
Hey, hey, hey.

691
01:19:21,825 --> 01:19:23,259
This time next week,

692
01:19:24,594 --> 01:19:25,762
we're gonna be dancing.

693
01:19:47,651 --> 01:19:52,155
Test subjects shows no
further signs of development.

694
01:19:56,359 --> 01:19:57,293
No pupils.

695
01:19:59,595 --> 01:20:01,698
Body motions still irregular.

696
01:20:02,699 --> 01:20:03,833
Agitated.

697
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:08,670
No vocal capabilities.

698
01:20:08,672 --> 01:20:12,175
Still no signs of basic
human communication.

699
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:17,211
I'll continue study
for two more days.

700
01:20:17,213 --> 01:20:18,982
If no further development,

701
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:25,321
I will terminate test subject.

702
01:22:47,897 --> 01:22:49,997
What are they doing?

703
01:22:53,569 --> 01:22:55,271
Are those security cameras?

704
01:25:34,497 --> 01:25:35,331
Lily!

705
01:26:26,782 --> 01:26:27,616
Lily.

706
01:26:47,636 --> 01:26:50,071
No, no, no, no, no.

707
01:26:50,073 --> 01:26:50,906
No.

708
01:26:53,809 --> 01:26:54,975
Oh, baby.

709
01:26:54,977 --> 01:26:55,811
Baby.

710
01:27:04,387 --> 01:27:05,388
Oh, sweetie.

711
01:27:33,849 --> 01:27:35,216
Okay, come on.

712
01:27:35,218 --> 01:27:36,150
Come on, baby.

713
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:32,873
The police.

714
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:33,740
Open up!

715
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:08,511
Ma'am?

716
01:29:09,545 --> 01:29:10,379
You're okay?

717
01:29:15,518 --> 01:29:18,319
What in the world.

718
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:16,805
Mom?

719
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:24,913
Mom?
