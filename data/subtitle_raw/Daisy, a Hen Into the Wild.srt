Come over here, kids!

- Let's lay eggs!
- Let's lay eggs!

00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:04,167
- Let's lay eggs!
- Let's lay eggs!

10
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,917
Hi, how's everyone today!

11
00:02:19,042 --> 00:02:22,625
It's our wonderful
dinner time again.

12
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,208
Hey my friend,
what're you looking at?

13
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,917
Hi, Chirpie. Welcome.

14
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:43,083
Are you still fixed on going
out to the yard?

15
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,958
I'll get out of here
for sure! You'll see!

16
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,292
Here we go again.
Still don't get it, do you?

17
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:53,375
You'll never get out of here!

18
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,167
So don't even dream about it.

19
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:57,292
There's no way out.

20
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:58,875
But there is!

21
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,458
I've stopped eating
for the past three days.

22
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:05,375
If I pretend to be dead,
I can get out of here.

23
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,667
Starving yourself?
And for three days?

24
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,667
Just the thought makes me
feel horrible.

25
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,958
What's wrong with this place?

26
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:17,542
They give you food and a home.
Just lay eggs and it's all okay.

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,458
Just lay eggs?

28
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:22,958
Don't say that.

29
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:26,458
I want to sit on my own eggs.

30
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,750
Snap out of it!

31
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:35,542
I want to go out to the yard
and walk on the earth.

32
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,625
Look up at the sky...

33
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:42,042
- And hatch my eggs...
- Come on, try eating again.

34
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:45,833
Hey! Look here!

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,042
Wake up!

36
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:52,708
There's a dead hen over here!

37
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,500
A dead hen!
Someone save her!

38
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:14,292
This one's been
wasting away for days...

39
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,417
Darn it!

40
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,042
<i>Watch out!</i>

41
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,250
Be careful!

42
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,333
Thank you so much.

43
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,417
Always beware of the weasel.

44
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:57,625
It is cruel and vicious and
only eats live prey.

45
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,583
My name is Leafie.

46
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,458
Like a leaf on a tree.

47
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:22,375
Without leaves,
flowers can't bloom.

48
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:26,458
So what's your name?

49
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:28,458
I'm relieved that
you're alive.

50
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:31,667
Now go back to
where you came from.

51
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:38,833
No, I never want to go back!

52
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,625
I escaped my cage
to get to the yard.

53
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,125
The yard?

54
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,125
Yes.

55
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,542
I used to stare at
the yard all day.

56
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:52,125
I've got many friends there
and it's a great place to live.

57
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,250
If you come with me,
I'll introduce you to them.

58
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:03,167
Hey...

59
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:16,125
Wow.

60
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,125
Wow, it's you,

61
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,625
The white petals who
dance in the wind!

62
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,833
Magnificent!

63
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,000
Hey, who're you?

64
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,125
Hi there!

65
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:31,917
Good to see you, Yard Dog!

66
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,500
It's a real pleasure to
meet you up close like this.

67
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:39,792
Uh, what's this? It feels good.

68
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,417
Uh? Over there!

69
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:43,792
Please stop!

70
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,375
Hello, everyone!

71
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:53,375
I'm Leafie!

72
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,875
I know you guys well.
I even named each of you.

73
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,375
Your names are...

74
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,875
Doe, Mee, Sol...

75
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:02,958
Toe!

76
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:08,458
How's that? You're always
lined up like musical notes.

77
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,292
Doe.

78
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:11,958
Mee.

79
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:12,667
Sol.

80
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:14,375
Toe!

81
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:17,625
Who's she?

82
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:19,958
Oh my!

83
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,625
How pretty!

84
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:24,542
- Hi, yellow angels.
- Kids!

85
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,458
Get over here, now!

86
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:28,750
What's her problem?

87
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,958
Hey, you're brooding eggs.

88
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,250
They're bigger than
the ones I laid.

89
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,833
Go away!

90
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,458
Stop poking your
filthy wings at them!

91
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:42,542
Uh? I didn't see you up there!

92
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:49,292
You always get up first and
crow with such grand force!

93
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,792
That's why I named you... Morning.

94
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,500
Did you just call me 'you'
and not 'Boss? '

95
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,208
Never address me that way again!

96
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,417
Boss? What's that?

97
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,292
Anyway, I came here
to live in the yard.

98
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,292
Let's be friends from now on.

99
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:17,125
Has she gone mad?

100
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,917
The barn's crowded
enough with two hens...

101
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:21,292
And now one more?

102
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,667
It'll cause nothing but disorder!

103
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,375
Right, right. Order's important!

104
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,083
Get out!

105
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,292
- Say something, Boss!
- Leave!

106
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:33,375
Everyone stop!

107
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:38,083
I can tell you've escaped
from the egg barn.

108
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:41,792
Stop causing havoc here.
Just go home and lay your eggs.

109
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:44,583
Those are the rules
you should follow.

110
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:46,583
No!

111
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,292
I won't go back!

112
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,583
I don't like those rules!

113
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,292
Silence! That's an order!

114
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:56,042
If you don't leave right now,
I'll call our Master.

115
00:09:56,167 --> 00:10:00,125
Get lost. You hear?

116
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:04,458
- But where am I supposed to go?
- That's not my problem!

117
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:09,542
Back to the egg barn or out
into the forest, I don't care.

118
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,042
Get out!

119
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,625
Lights out!

120
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,833
Now...

121
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,958
Get lost!

122
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:15,792
Wow, this place is huge.

123
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,375
Hello everyone! I'm Leafie!

124
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,875
So nice to meet you!

125
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,125
Uh, hi.

126
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:54,917
Hey.

127
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:00,333
Wow.

128
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:04,542
Oh my!

129
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,917
Hello, nice to meet you.

130
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,917
You look kind of funny.

131
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:14,417
Who're you to talk
about my looks?

132
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:16,792
It must be true that you've
lost all sense of reality.

133
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,708
Huh? Do you know me?

134
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:24,208
Sure I do. You're the crazy hen
who escaped the chicken farm.

135
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:29,625
Oh, how nice to meet you.
I'm Leafie. And who're you?

136
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:37,208
I'm the realtor around here.
I go by 'Living Consultant.'

137
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,000
But if that's hard,
just call me 'Mr. Otter.'

138
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:40,833
Mr. Otter?

139
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:42,875
Mr. Otter... Ot...

140
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,292
What about Mayor?

141
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,500
Nice to meet you
Mr. Mayor.

142
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,458
You're not only crazy
but deaf as well.

143
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,500
Anyway, I'm a really
busy person.

144
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,958
No, a busy otter.

145
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,583
As everyone seems to need me,

146
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,292
I can't waste my time
fiddling around with you.

147
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,583
I can see you really are crazy.

148
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:02,667
Since you're new, here's a tip.

149
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,458
This place cannot manage
without me.

150
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:09,083
Moreover, I promised the
wild duck I'd find you a place.

151
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,583
Jeez, no one ever
leaves me alone.

152
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,583
Wild duck?

153
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,167
You mean Wanderer?

154
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,458
Did he ask you to do that? Why?

155
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:19,042
Why?

156
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:22,333
Go ask him in person...

157
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,042
or in hen.

158
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:27,750
Now, I'll decide where
you should live, so listen up.

159
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,250
Since these feet
aren't fit to swim,

160
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,042
the stream and
the everglade are out.

161
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,458
And these wings aren't fit
to fly, so the treetops too

162
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:49,000
are out.

163
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:56,292
Since your feet aren't fast, the
plains and the woods won't do.

164
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:59,792
Cause the one-eyed weasel
runs wild around there.

165
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:07,792
Why d'ya leave the yard?
What for? Why? Why? Why?

166
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:11,125
I'll find my own place,
so don't bother.

167
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:16,292
How dare you underestimate me,
the Mayor, I mean, Mr. Otter.

168
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,792
Didn't I tell you this place'll
come to a stop without me?

169
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:23,083
Just stay put and
wait for my decision.

170
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:24,458
Hey!

171
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:29,458
That's it! It will
be the brier patch!

172
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,292
The brier patch?

173
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:39,875
The thorn and flower camouflaged
bushes are it's strongest points.

174
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,792
Why?

175
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,583
Once you're surrounded
by strong scented flowers

176
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:47,792
The one-eyed weasel won't
be able to smell prey like you.

177
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,292
I'm just too smart
for my own good!

178
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:53,583
<i>Someone should steal</i>

179
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,875
<i>- some of my knowledge.
- I'm nobody's prey.</i>

180
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,542
Mayor!

181
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:19,125
Wanderer! Hey, Wanderer...

182
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:25,333
They're pretty serious
about each other.

183
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:27,458
They wanted their own place.

184
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,708
So I found them a
brier patch much like yours.

185
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:33,708
The brier patch has
become such a hot item.

186
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,625
I'm worried that
demands will hit the roof...

187
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,417
They're a perfect match...

188
00:15:38,542 --> 00:15:40,792
Of course it is. The brier patch

189
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,292
is an environment-friendly
space I've created.

190
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:47,625
But make sure the brier
flowers don't wither.

191
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,000
Or else that weasel will...

192
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:10,167
I'm jealous! I want a
sweetheart, too!

193
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:09,625
NO!

194
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,125
Stop there!

195
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,083
No!

196
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:19,958
You're still warm.

197
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:32,250
I will take care of
you like this.

198
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:14,333
What's his problem?
I can't sleep.

199
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,458
Not bad with just one wing.

200
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:26,833
But beware.

201
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:31,792
Cause I won't go after your good
wing, but your neck next time.

202
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,000
Try it and I'll scratch out
the one eye you have left.

203
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,500
By the way...

204
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,958
What's that you're doing
each night on the hill?

205
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,167
Sorry but please stop.

206
00:21:18,917 --> 00:21:23,958
It gets so noisy each night, I'm
worried you'll startle the baby.

207
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,292
The moon's become round.

208
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,667
That means the egg's
about to hatch.

209
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,792
Really?

210
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,292
Then I can see the baby soon?

211
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:39,542
But the full moon also means
the weasel's stomach is empty.

212
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:48,250
I'll be fine. Look. My claws and
beak have become tougher.

213
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,833
I won't be beaten easily
even if the weasel appears.

214
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,958
Leafie!

215
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,458
Did you just call me
by my name?

216
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,542
Thanks.

217
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:06,542
When the baby's born, go to
the everglade past the east forest.

218
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,292
Why should I go to the everglade?

219
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,125
In time you'll understand.

220
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,500
Leafie, you're a great hen.

221
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,917
I've been meaning
to tell you that.

222
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:23,208
I made a name for you,
It's Wanderer.

223
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,292
Wanderer?

224
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:27,208
Yes.

225
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:47,958
<i>Here!</i>

226
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:51,667
<i>Over here!</i>

227
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,750
<i>Catch me if you can!</i>

228
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,667
<i>Is that the best you can do?</i>

229
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:11,958
Wanderer!

230
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,750
Wanderer!

231
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,000
<i>No!</i>

232
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:53,792
<i>Wanderer!</i>

233
00:24:01,458 --> 00:24:02,625
No!

234
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:30,750
Wanderer...

235
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:37,125
My baby! Baby!

236
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:38,125
Baby?

237
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,125
Mama!

238
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:13,375
Mama...

239
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,250
Baby...

240
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,083
Baby!

241
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:52,167
Achoo!

242
00:26:56,583 --> 00:26:57,958
Let's go, baby.

243
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,458
Baby, come over here!

244
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,250
Hello!

245
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:22,042
I'm Leafie.

246
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,167
And this is my baby.

247
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:28,458
Don't look at us that way
since we're not staying here.

248
00:28:28,583 --> 00:28:30,833
We're heading to the everglade.

249
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:54,292
Giddyup, giddyup! Go!

250
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:02,917
Look who it is! Hey my friend,
don't you remember me?

251
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:07,708
Chirpie? How nice to see you!

252
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:11,917
Wow, and I thought
you were dead.

253
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,625
And you never looked better.
How luscious your feathers are!

254
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:18,208
And who's this?

255
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:22,167
Say hi my little baby
to mommy's friend, Chirpie.

256
00:29:22,917 --> 00:29:26,875
Mommy? Can a hen
give birth to a duck?

257
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:32,250
This is news, big news...
I can't stop laughing.

258
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:34,375
So where're you headed now?

259
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:35,958
We're on our way to the everglade.

260
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:37,458
We're going to live there.

261
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:42,167
No, friend. Come back
to the chicken farm, please.

262
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:45,958
Without you, meal times
have been hell for me.

263
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,458
Well, bye now.
See you again, Chirpie.

264
00:29:56,792 --> 00:30:00,042
Please come back!

265
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,750
So, this is it!

266
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:10,833
Wanderer, we finally
made it to the everglade.

267
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,542
This place is really great.

268
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,458
Wow! Everyone!

269
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:19,833
You all look magnificent!

270
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:22,958
<i>You all look magnificent!
You all look magnificent!</i>

271
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:27,042
Huh? Me?

272
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:29,208
I guess they mean us.

273
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:31,125
Hey! Who was that?

274
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:32,625
You mean me?

275
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:36,417
Who's that?
With such a loud voice?

276
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:43,708
My baby, please be careful.

277
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:53,417
My baby must've been
really hungry.

278
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:58,417
Stay right there!

279
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:44,750
Baby...

280
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:47,417
Where are you, baby?

281
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:48,458
Baby!

282
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:49,542
Baby!

283
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:58,833
No, no! Don't move!

284
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,750
No!

285
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:06,042
No, baby, stop!
Don't come this way!

286
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:12,125
Baby!

287
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,708
What the heck do you
think you're dong?

288
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:30,708
A hen jumping into the water...
Are you gonna try to fly next?

289
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:36,208
Oh wow, you made my day!

290
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:41,875
Mayor, please help!
Baby's drowning!

291
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:46,583
You mean that baby?

292
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:47,792
Bravo!

293
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:50,583
Did you see that?
My baby's swimming!

294
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:55,958
I never taught him. But he
learned all by himself.

295
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:57,667
Isn't it great?

296
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,083
My baby's a genius, a genius!

297
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:01,583
'My baby? '

298
00:33:02,917 --> 00:33:04,958
You're surely one crazy hen.

299
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:07,667
Leaving the chicken farm
for the wild.

300
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:11,958
And now the everglade, claiming that
green headed duck's your baby?

301
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:13,292
Green head?

302
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,250
Green head...

303
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:19,458
That's it! I should call my
baby Greenie from now on!

304
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,958
What a perfect name.
Greenie!

305
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,250
Greenie!
- What's all the racket?

306
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:28,125
- Greenie!
- Hey, listen...

307
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:29,833
- Greenie!
- Hey! Hey, listen...

308
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,750
- Greenie!
- Keep it down!

309
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:36,042
Greenie!

310
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:37,792
Greenie... No.

311
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:44,292
Come here.
My baby.

312
00:34:59,667 --> 00:35:01,125
Crack open, will you?

313
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,125
Mr. Mayor!

314
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:11,958
When will you teach me
how to swim underwater?

315
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:13,333
You forgot to say, please!

316
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,417
The rule to underwater swimming
is breathing. Breathing.

317
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:22,542
It starts from breathing
and ends with breathing.

318
00:35:22,667 --> 00:35:24,958
Now follow me.

319
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:38,917
Greenie, don't stray far!

320
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,083
How nice and quiet
everything is.

321
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:23,875
You guys all look the same.

322
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:25,792
I envy you all.
That's so cool.

323
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,958
- We look the same to you?
- Really? We can't tell.

324
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:35,042
You're so different from your
Mom. Is she your real mom?

325
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,833
Right. It is odd.

326
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,333
She never comes into the water.

327
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:43,042
Can she even swim?

328
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:48,958
It's so strange! There's even
a flower attached to her tail.

329
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,958
My mom told me,

330
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,042
only mad birds wear flowers.

331
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:55,042
Uh, what's this?

332
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,125
Darn it!

333
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:02,958
Darn!

334
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:12,583
What's wrong, children?
Why're you crying?

335
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,917
It's because of him.

336
00:37:15,958 --> 00:37:19,000
Didn't I tell you never to play
with a strange kid like him?

337
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:21,208
Honey, let's go. Well, I never!

338
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:22,417
Honey!

339
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:30,458
Excuse me!

340
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:34,125
Mr. Mayor told me to come see you.

341
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:36,458
Mayor? That good for nothing realtor.

342
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:39,458
If I ever get my hands on him...

343
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:42,333
Why the hell is this cave
leaking all day?

344
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:44,958
Whenever it rains,
this place is a mess.

345
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,625
Mr. Mayor told me a rumour that

346
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:51,500
when it comes to flying you're
the best around this place.

347
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:55,500
That's not a rumor but a fact.

348
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,125
Look carefully! Close your eyes,

349
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:02,000
then use your animal
instincts to take off!

350
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,125
Wow.

351
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,375
Wow.

352
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:22,667
What do you think?

353
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:24,083
Easy, huh?

354
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:25,875
Wow.

355
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:29,375
Then shall we start
from the beginning?

356
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,958
First, trying dangling like this!

357
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:31,792
Huh?

358
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:35,583
Don't stand there like that.
Hurry up here! Come!

359
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,167
Darn it.

360
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,083
Hey, kid! Come up here.

361
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:42,083
Hey!

362
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,292
No thanks, mister.

363
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,125
Jeez, look how my
heart's pounding.

364
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:06,833
Hey, kid, let's be real here.

365
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,750
Are you trying to fly
or die?

366
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:11,750
But you said it's
all about guts!

367
00:40:12,292 --> 00:40:15,333
You idiot, you call that guts?

368
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,333
Just go home and first
make yourself a man!

369
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:21,042
I'm so sleepy.

370
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:23,625
Sleepy, so sleepy...

371
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:27,917
Darn it!

372
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:30,792
Mayor, let's be honest.

373
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:34,208
Does it make sense
that a hen's living here?

374
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,792
I can't fish because
she's such a loud mouth!

375
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:40,125
Mayor, you suck as a realtor!

376
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:42,292
Their relationship's
confusing to the children.

377
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:46,000
- Kick them out right now!
- Okay, I got it. So shush!

378
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:47,417
Hey!

379
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:48,583
Hi, everyone!

380
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:52,208
Hi, angel's wing.
Hi, bird-riding-on-the-bullet.

381
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:54,792
Hi...

382
00:40:57,958 --> 00:40:59,125
What's up?

383
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,167
Hey, what're those on your feet?

384
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,083
Oh, right.

385
00:41:03,292 --> 00:41:05,167
I need a favor.

386
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:09,750
Greenie's been acting odd lately.
Skipping trips to the nest.

387
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:13,167
So, I've decided to learn
how to swim underwater.

388
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:17,750
OK, I'll give it to you straight.
First, a little voice-tuning.

389
00:41:17,917 --> 00:41:19,958
You've been sick with a cold
for a month.

390
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:21,958
It's because your feathers
get wet when it rains.

391
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:24,667
But, Greenie's feathers
are always dry.

392
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:25,958
You can't swim at all,

393
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:27,875
but Greenie can.
And I mean really well.

394
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,875
What I'm saying is, you two are
different in breed and lifestyle.

395
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,542
So? What's wrong
with being different?

396
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:37,625
You're not hearing anything
that I'm saying!

397
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:41,250
Keep this up and
you'll wither away!

398
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:42,042
Give it back.

399
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,958
So, I really think it's definitely,
absolutely necessary that

400
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:50,333
you return to the farm!

401
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,042
The farm? Never!

402
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:55,458
I'm staying here with my Greenie!

403
00:41:55,583 --> 00:41:57,958
You can't separate a mother
from her child!

404
00:41:58,167 --> 00:42:02,125
You're only challenging
the laws of nature!

405
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:05,833
But the main problem is
that everyone here hates you!

406
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Oh, no! Darn...

407
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:13,125
Well, not everyone, I mean...

408
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:16,708
I've got such a big mouth.
Bad mouth, bad!

409
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:42,667
Greenie! Where have you
been? I've been worried.

410
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:43,792
Darn!

411
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:49,083
Stop hovering near the water!
You can't swim...

412
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,875
The kids keep teasing me.

413
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:55,167
What? Why? Who's teasing you?

414
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:59,667
Nobody wants to play with me.
It's all your fault!

415
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:00,958
I'm...

416
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:02,375
ashamed of you!

417
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:05,792
You're ashamed of me?

418
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:11,750
Stop, I'm serious. My wings
have been so itchy lately.

419
00:43:11,917 --> 00:43:14,333
Why are they itchy? Let me see.

420
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,125
No! You don't understand!
Can't you see I want to fly?

421
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:22,458
But you know we can't fly.

422
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:26,625
Stop saying 'we.' I'm
different from you! Different!

423
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:31,250
Yes, we're different.

424
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:32,750
So what?

425
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,958
We can be different but
still love each other!

426
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:36,833
I don't want to be
with you anymore!

427
00:43:39,292 --> 00:43:40,250
Greenie!

428
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:41,250
Baby!

429
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:44,750
Stop calling me 'baby! '
I'm not a baby anymore!

430
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:47,125
Greenie...

431
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:00,500
Is that you, Greenie?

432
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:04,208
Oh no!

433
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:07,792
I'm so sorry.

434
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:11,417
He said he wanted to fly so
I introduced him around...

435
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:16,417
Want some? It's fresh...

436
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:25,958
Wanderer, I'm sorry.

437
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:27,083
Wanderer?

438
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,292
Right! It was Wanderer.

439
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,458
Greenie looks like him.

440
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:34,292
He certainly does resemble
that wild guard duck.

441
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:36,083
I'm not just imagining
things, am I?

442
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:39,750
Guard? Wanderer's a guard duck?
What's a guard?

443
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,875
Mayor, tell me about Wanderer!

444
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:49,167
The wind was fierce that day.

445
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:55,250
<i>Our first encounter... lt was
fatal moment, I should say!</i>

446
00:44:58,083 --> 00:45:02,250
What's this? A sudden
thunderbolt? No, a bird-bolt!

447
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:09,917
Cool, huh? No one can
slam the brakes on like me.

448
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:13,042
Bravo. And who're you? You
almost scared me to death!

449
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:14,750
Pleasure to meet you.

450
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:18,042
You'll be seeing more of me,
the best guard duck around!

451
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:21,958
<i>That guard duck was Wanderer...</i>

452
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:28,208
<i>Among his flock, he flew
the highest and the fastest.</i>

453
00:45:28,542 --> 00:45:30,417
<i>He always arrived first to find
a resting place for his flock</i>

454
00:45:30,542 --> 00:45:32,792
<i>and protect them.</i>

455
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:37,500
<i>Really? Then why couldn't
he fly when I first met him?</i>

456
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:42,000
<i>As always, the problem was
the one-eyed weasel.</i>

457
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:43,917
<i>Ah, he was truly brave.</i>

458
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:47,125
<i>No one could've fought
that weasel like him.</i>

459
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:49,500
<i>But then...</i>

460
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:50,625
<i>He...</i>

461
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:56,500
<i>Enough...</i>

462
00:45:57,042 --> 00:45:59,792
<i>Wanderer who could no longer
fly was captured by the Master.</i>

463
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:04,792
<i>And that's how he ended up
in the yard...</i>

464
00:46:04,917 --> 00:46:07,292
<i>Did you just say Wanderer
used to live in the yard?</i>

465
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,792
<i>But being a wild duck who flew
the skies, he could never</i>

466
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:17,292
<i>be happy there.</i>

467
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:19,375
<i>I see...</i>

468
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:23,167
<i>So that's what happened
to Wanderer...</i>

469
00:46:55,667 --> 00:47:03,458
Duck, ducks quack, quack, house
ducks sing Do, Mi, Sol, Toe

470
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:13,500
to the march of their feet...
Waddle, waddle.

471
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:21,000
Who do you think you are?!
Who're you?

472
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,708
Uh? You look new.

473
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:27,792
Yo! How dare you push
your beak into our turf?!

474
00:47:28,042 --> 00:47:30,083
Uh? But he looks familiar.

475
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,208
- Right! He looks just like him!
- You're right!

476
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:35,125
Who're you guys?

477
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:40,083
Uh? He even sounds like
that arrogant wild duck.

478
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,458
Wild duck?

479
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,292
He used to live in our yard.

480
00:47:43,417 --> 00:47:45,958
Yeah, he was a wanderer
who looks like you.

481
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:47,083
Like me?

482
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:50,750
Yeah. And how he put on such
airs when he couldn't even fly.

483
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:54,167
He may have been our kind,
but he was one stuck up dude.

484
00:47:54,292 --> 00:47:56,583
Yard? Where's this yard
you're talking about?

485
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:59,583
Can he be more clueless?

486
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:00,958
Wanna go there?

487
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:01,875
Yes!

488
00:48:03,792 --> 00:48:04,583
Yeah, let's go.

489
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:06,250
Yeah, let's go together.

490
00:48:12,917 --> 00:48:14,917
What a bunch of scrooges!

491
00:48:15,083 --> 00:48:17,833
Fine, I won't touch
your filthy food!

492
00:48:18,167 --> 00:48:21,625
Doe, Mi, Sol, Toe! March to the
front yard, to the back yard!

493
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:23,250
Hey, I know him...

494
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,750
Isn't that?
He looks like Leafie's kid...

495
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:36,250
Who're you?

496
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:38,958
Hi, I'm Greenie.

497
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:45,042
- You're one sad-looking dude.
- I'm kinda feeling good again.

498
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,708
Where did you come from, kid?

499
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:57,125
He seems totally out of it.
Look how dazed he is.

500
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:06,417
Is this the yard? There's
not even any water here.

501
00:49:06,542 --> 00:49:09,917
Hey stupid. How can a duck
live without water?

502
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:19,125
Have some dignity, will you?

503
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,458
The best place to pee
is in the water.

504
00:49:29,417 --> 00:49:30,667
Yuck!

505
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:41,792
This must be my lucky day.
A wild duck!

506
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:45,167
- This one's pretty strong!
- Let go of me!

507
00:49:45,292 --> 00:49:46,875
I'll cut off his wings first.

508
00:49:49,792 --> 00:49:51,292
Be still!

509
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:02,833
- Greenie!
- Hey, Greenie!

510
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,750
- Where are you, Greenie!
- Greenie!

511
00:50:06,167 --> 00:50:07,542
- Where the hell is he?
- Greenie!

512
00:50:08,792 --> 00:50:12,542
Hey friend, what're you doing here?!
Your kid's...

513
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:16,250
- Yikes! How scary...
- Why you little... Get lost!

514
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:18,750
Chirpie, did you say you've
seen Greenie?

515
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:21,917
Yeah, he's in the yard.
There's no time for this!

516
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:24,250
Master's gonna
cut his wings off.

517
00:50:24,875 --> 00:50:26,917
What? His wings?!

518
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:37,625
Greenie!

519
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:47,625
Mom!

520
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:03,667
- Please help me!
- Stop it!

521
00:51:03,917 --> 00:51:05,458
Stop making such a fuss!

522
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:11,167
Mom!

523
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,292
Greenie!

524
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:15,458
Ah, poor kid.

525
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,167
Let go of me! Let me go!

526
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:25,750
No!

527
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,042
Hey, you crazy hen!

528
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:41,042
Hey friend, get up!

529
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:42,125
Go away!

530
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:43,542
Greenie!

531
00:51:45,292 --> 00:51:47,750
Please save my Greenie.
We have to release everyone.

532
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:48,917
Help me, Mayor!

533
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:51,250
Okay, here I go!

534
00:52:01,292 --> 00:52:02,250
Let go of me!

535
00:52:02,875 --> 00:52:05,833
Mayor! You must send out all the
hens. Put on your scariest face.

536
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:06,500
Okay.

537
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:08,792
- Okay.
- Hurry, please hurry!

538
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:14,500
Scared?!

539
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:27,625
The Mayor, no Otter needs
help over here! Oh my tail! Help! It'sthe Mayor, no, Otter!

540
00:52:32,958 --> 00:52:36,125
Everyone, get out, NOW!

541
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:38,000
Fire the dung!

542
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:49,583
Get out!

543
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,458
Hey! Stop the chickens!

544
00:52:54,417 --> 00:52:54,958
Greenie!

545
00:52:55,125 --> 00:52:55,875
Mom!

546
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:13,125
Mom!

547
00:53:13,792 --> 00:53:14,833
Greenie!

548
00:53:20,583 --> 00:53:22,958
There's no time for a family
reunion. Let's go!

549
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:25,958
Let's go!

550
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:29,958
Where do you think
you're going?!

551
00:53:30,583 --> 00:53:33,042
How could one of my egg hens
give birth to a duck?

552
00:53:33,167 --> 00:53:34,833
Move! We've got to
get out of here quick!

553
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:37,750
Shut up! You've disgraced
the entire chicken breed!

554
00:53:37,875 --> 00:53:40,417
Furthermore, you've destroyed
the peace in the yard!

555
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:44,625
In the name of justice,
I will make you pay.

556
00:53:54,958 --> 00:53:56,000
Hey, what's this?

557
00:53:56,125 --> 00:53:57,792
Step away or be stepped on.

558
00:54:02,542 --> 00:54:05,208
Was this all just a joke?

559
00:54:05,333 --> 00:54:07,125
Attention, everyone!

560
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:11,000
From now on,
I'll be the Boss of this yard!

561
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:13,917
They all ran for their lives.

562
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:17,000
Hey, was I scary or what?

563
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:20,167
Mom, you were really
great back there.

564
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,167
What about me? How did I do?

565
00:54:25,417 --> 00:54:27,167
Mr. Mayor, you were great too.

566
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:31,583
Can you be more stingy
with the compliments, you brat?

567
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:37,667
Mom, mom.

568
00:54:38,417 --> 00:54:39,167
Mom...

569
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:43,375
I'm so sorry. I'll never
behave that way again.

570
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,042
Are your wings okay?

571
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:58,333
Yes.

572
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:08,917
Now you really look like a mother.

573
00:55:13,458 --> 00:55:15,833
Why're you always picking on us?

574
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:20,542
- And the white duck, Wanderer...
- I was just hunting!

575
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:26,417
When I was hungry,
they just caught my eye.

576
00:55:28,042 --> 00:55:30,500
Like you this moment.

577
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,500
So, who should I eat first?

578
00:55:41,125 --> 00:55:41,917
Mom.

579
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,625
No!

580
00:56:39,792 --> 00:56:41,750
Don't you dare touch my baby!

581
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:49,958
Run Greenie, run!

582
00:57:58,292 --> 00:58:00,292
My baby... Greenie.

583
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:04,583
Greenie!

584
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,042
Mom!

585
00:58:16,167 --> 00:58:16,958
Mom!

586
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:21,625
Look, I'm flying! I'm flying!

587
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:31,333
How amazing!
That's my baby!

588
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:34,750
Wonderful, Greenie!

589
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:38,042
I'm so proud of you, my boy!

590
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:49,792
Ah, autumn's here already.

591
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:53,708
How time passes without notice.

592
00:59:05,958 --> 00:59:08,000
How he has grown.

593
00:59:09,042 --> 00:59:11,500
Hey, shoo. You don't
want to see me mad.

594
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:21,458
Shouldn't you start grooming?
It's crucial as you get older.

595
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:24,167
Your face has become as
gaunt as a sick chicken.

596
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:26,958
And your body seems to
have shrunken as well.

597
00:59:27,792 --> 00:59:30,375
Get lost, leave me alone!

598
00:59:31,417 --> 00:59:32,292
Hey!

599
00:59:35,917 --> 00:59:38,292
Are you happy you're
flying, Greenie?

600
00:59:38,417 --> 00:59:42,375
Yes. But mom, I've been
feeling weird these days.

601
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:46,458
I never felt this way before.
Like something's coming.

602
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:49,167
What? You mean the weasel?

603
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:51,875
No, that's not it.

604
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,542
Can't you feel it, mom?

605
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:01,125
It's coming, mom.

606
01:00:01,792 --> 01:00:04,750
What is, Greenie? Are you okay?

607
01:00:06,292 --> 01:00:10,250
Mom, my heart's beating so hard...

608
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:21,333
Oh my, they're coming!
They're coming!

609
01:00:21,458 --> 01:00:24,833
And they're as noisy as ever!

610
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:30,417
Over here, here!
Welcome to my world!

611
01:00:48,042 --> 01:00:51,417
The flock seems larger
in size this time!

612
01:00:51,833 --> 01:00:56,417
Looks like sales will
skyrocket this year!

613
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,292
When the baby's born, go to
the everglade past the east forest.

614
01:01:17,917 --> 01:01:20,375
<i>Why should I go to the everglade?</i>

615
01:01:20,792 --> 01:01:23,083
In time you'll understand.

616
01:01:32,875 --> 01:01:36,250
Greenie. Go.
They're your friends.

617
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:38,542
Go and introduce yourself.

618
01:01:40,167 --> 01:01:41,458
Okay, mom.

619
01:01:43,292 --> 01:01:44,333
I'll be right back.

620
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:50,458
Let me hold you for a bit.

621
01:01:58,167 --> 01:02:02,042
- Hi, I'm Greenie.
- Keep the flight line!

622
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:05,625
Sorry!

623
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:12,625
Hey, you! Watch out!

624
01:02:23,833 --> 01:02:26,292
A flight contest will
soon be held.

625
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:29,292
The winner will become the
new guard duck.

626
01:02:29,458 --> 01:02:30,500
Anyone wanting to compete,
get ready.

627
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:34,083
- Red Hair, you'll compete, right?
- Definitely.

628
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:37,208
You'll see. The guard spot's
mine this time.

629
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:38,417
What's a guard duck?

630
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,875
What? Don't you know?
Are you stupid or what?

631
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,958
Who're you?

632
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:46,083
- This dude looks suspicious.
- I know.

633
01:02:46,417 --> 01:02:49,167
Never seen him before.
Which flock are you from?

634
01:02:49,292 --> 01:02:53,250
Flock? I don't have one.
It's just me.

635
01:02:53,625 --> 01:02:54,083
What?

636
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,583
What kind of migrant bird
flies alone?

637
01:02:57,292 --> 01:02:58,875
Wait! What's this?

638
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,958
- Humans have tied this on him!
- It's a string!

639
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:02,083
Look here!

640
01:03:02,417 --> 01:03:06,458
We've got a suspicious one here!
He has a human string on him!

641
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:07,375
Uh? Hey!

642
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:21,125
Is that you, Greenie?

643
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:33,750
Greenie.

644
01:03:35,875 --> 01:03:36,833
Darn.

645
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:40,917
Greenie, are you okay?
Is something wrong?

646
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:47,000
I want to live with you
like before.

647
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:51,292
What are you talking about?
You should be with your friends.

648
01:03:52,042 --> 01:03:54,917
They're leaving in a few days.

649
01:04:01,125 --> 01:04:05,208
Greenie, don't forget that
you're a wild duck.

650
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:09,292
You can be a brave guard duck,
like your father.

651
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:13,125
Fly with all your might.
Mommy will be watching.

652
01:04:32,417 --> 01:04:33,583
Mom!

653
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:36,875
I'm almost done.

654
01:04:44,625 --> 01:04:45,583
Mom...

655
01:04:46,917 --> 01:04:48,667
Could you grab that end?

656
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:54,042
Hurry, okay?

657
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:04,250
- Mom, mom, are you okay?
- Yes.

658
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:07,125
But I can't seem to
untie this knot my child.

659
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:13,333
Okay, this will be our mark
that you're my baby.

660
01:05:13,458 --> 01:05:16,125
So I can recognize you
wherever you are.

661
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:17,542
Mom...

662
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:24,542
Mom!

663
01:05:32,042 --> 01:05:35,083
I've got bulbs and
dried shrimp here!

664
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:37,000
There's tasty mudfish, too!
And I'll throw in some minnows!

665
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:41,500
<i>And now's the live broadcast of
the 'Guard Duck Flying Contest.'</i>

666
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:43,625
We'll start the flying contest!

667
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:47,292
You may notice there's
a drop in entrants this year...

668
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:48,500
Yes! That is correct.

669
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:52,292
Such things like pollution,
rising divorce rate seems

670
01:05:52,458 --> 01:05:52,917
to have caused this decrease.

671
01:05:53,042 --> 01:05:54,083
<i>Bully!</i>

672
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,708
<i>Right, he's built more like
a bull rather than a duck.</i>

673
01:05:56,833 --> 01:05:58,292
<i>You can say he's got
the goods, right?</i>

674
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:00,875
<i>Next is Blade. Great speed
and clever as a fox.</i>

675
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,958
<i>And then we have Red Hair!
Our strongest contender!</i>

676
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:07,208
- Who'll win this time?
- Red Hair, of course.

677
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:09,667
<i>I would like to compete too!</i>

678
01:06:10,292 --> 01:06:11,375
He's the one with
the human string.

679
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,583
Who's that?

680
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:14,958
I want to be the
guard duck of this flock.

681
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:17,375
Get lost! This isn't
a contest for tramps...

682
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,083
Shut up!

683
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:20,167
Let me participate.

684
01:06:20,292 --> 01:06:22,167
What? Get lost!

685
01:06:22,583 --> 01:06:24,875
There's no room in this
contest for cowards like you!

686
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,292
Why don't you drop out?

687
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:30,167
- What? Why you little...
- Stop!

688
01:06:30,292 --> 01:06:32,833
As a guard duck should
excel in his flying ability,

689
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:34,750
I'll decide after
I see how you can fly.

690
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:36,833
- I permit you to compete.
- Thank you, sir!

691
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:42,125
<i>Now the contest will start.</i>

692
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:45,458
You must think anyone
can become a guard.

693
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:47,458
Just watch your back, buddy.

694
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:50,250
We'll start the contest!

695
01:06:56,083 --> 01:06:59,333
<i>This is nerve-racking, a big
fat nerve-racking moment.</i>

696
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:01,958
<i>And here they take off!</i>

697
01:07:03,167 --> 01:07:07,000
<i>As expected, Red Hair takes
the lead with incredible speed.</i>

698
01:07:07,125 --> 01:07:08,208
See if you can follow me.

699
01:07:08,333 --> 01:07:10,708
<i>They're supposed to shoot up
as soon as they take off...</i>

700
01:07:12,625 --> 01:07:15,500
<i>Ah! Greenie! What's he doing?</i>

701
01:07:16,542 --> 01:07:19,417
<i>He's using the headwind to fly up.</i>

702
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:29,500
<i>This is Greenie's first contest!
And he's doing a great job!</i>

703
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:38,417
Hey, kid! Amazing view, huh?

704
01:07:38,542 --> 01:07:41,375
Brace yourself cause
it's just getting started!

705
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:49,375
Guts boy, it's all about guts!

706
01:07:52,292 --> 01:07:55,750
Three, two, one, bungee!

707
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,333
Wow, it's Red Hair!

708
01:08:18,583 --> 01:08:20,833
<i>Ah, he should slow down.</i>

709
01:08:21,583 --> 01:08:22,458
Greenie.

710
01:08:28,083 --> 01:08:29,125
Greenie.

711
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:31,750
Quick, help him!

712
01:08:33,167 --> 01:08:36,833
<i>This is unfortunate. I just hope
he isn't seriously injured.</i>

713
01:08:38,083 --> 01:08:41,250
Greenie! Don't give up!
You can do it!

714
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:51,417
<i>Greenie's back in the race! And
he catapults forward unscathed!</i>

715
01:08:51,542 --> 01:08:53,292
<i>I'm so proud of you, Greenie!</i>

716
01:08:58,125 --> 01:08:59,000
Mom...

717
01:09:05,833 --> 01:09:07,708
Not bad.

718
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:08,917
Here we go!

719
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:24,083
So long, kid.

720
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,583
Watch out.

721
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:31,375
What? Oh...

722
01:09:35,792 --> 01:09:36,583
Not bad.

723
01:09:41,708 --> 01:09:43,750
<i>Now we're halfway through
the contest.</i>

724
01:09:44,208 --> 01:09:46,667
Greenie is in second place
right as we speak.

725
01:09:46,792 --> 01:09:48,375
Amazing!

726
01:09:50,417 --> 01:09:51,792
<i>Greenie's amazing.</i>

727
01:09:51,917 --> 01:09:54,625
<i>It looks like everyone's
starting to root for him.</i>

728
01:09:55,375 --> 01:09:58,333
<i>What's Bully doing?
Isn't that a foul?</i>

729
01:09:58,792 --> 01:10:01,625
<i>Not really. More serious
incidents occur during flight.</i>

730
01:10:01,792 --> 01:10:04,750
<i>And it should be seen
as part of the contest.</i>

731
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:21,917
<i>And Bully plummets out
of the race. Serves him right!</i>

732
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:26,792
See if you can follow me.

733
01:10:26,958 --> 01:10:29,208
<i>What an exciting match
we're having today.</i>

734
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:33,000
Close your eyes,

735
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:37,000
then use your animal
instincts to take off!

736
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:49,292
Watch out, kid.

737
01:11:02,417 --> 01:11:04,958
<i>Greenie's having a race like
we've never seen before.</i>

738
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:06,875
<i>The rising star of the wild ducks!</i>

739
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,458
<i>Every Tom, Dick and Harry is
cheering for Greenie.</i>

740
01:11:10,708 --> 01:11:12,250
Guess I gotta sweep this place...

741
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:16,583
Hey!

742
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:31,667
Having fun?

743
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:34,417
Hey!

744
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:36,125
What're they doing?

745
01:11:42,958 --> 01:11:44,625
It's that wild duck!

746
01:11:44,792 --> 01:11:47,750
Why's he wasting
his time flying?

747
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:52,750
Right, Rooster?
Huh? Where'd he go?

748
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:55,417
<i>Now the contest is
reaching its final stage.</i>

749
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:59,125
<i>Strong winds from high up
makes flyiing difficult.</i>

750
01:12:02,292 --> 01:12:05,500
<i>The experienced Red Hair
descends towards the waterway.</i>

751
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:08,125
<i>But won't that increase
his flight distance?</i>

752
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:10,500
<i>I guess he's going for a route
with less wind resistance.</i>

753
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:13,625
<i>Really? I guess you're right.</i>

754
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,708
<i>Greenie's also heading
for the waterway.</i>

755
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,625
<i>And he slowly gains ground.</i>

756
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:20,708
<i>They're almost at
the finish line!</i>

757
01:12:20,833 --> 01:12:24,417
<i>Any strength left should go
into the final spurt. But...</i>

758
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:27,792
Hey, you can't go
through that way!

759
01:12:28,042 --> 01:12:30,083
It's too dangerous!

760
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:31,792
<i>Greenie.</i>

761
01:12:32,625 --> 01:12:36,708
<i>From now on you can go
wherever you want to.</i>

762
01:12:42,417 --> 01:12:45,958
<i>Fly with all your might.
Mommy will be watching you.</i>

763
01:12:58,417 --> 01:12:59,667
Uh? Who's that?

764
01:13:01,125 --> 01:13:03,750
Ah! And it's Greenie
who's in the lead!

765
01:13:29,167 --> 01:13:32,250
<i>500m, 400m... will it be
Greenie or Red Hair?</i>

766
01:13:36,375 --> 01:13:42,042
<i>Greenie! Greenie! Greenie!
Greenie! Greenie! Greenie!</i>

767
01:13:45,042 --> 01:13:46,417
It's Greenie!

768
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:52,208
<i>We finally have
a new guard duck!</i>

769
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:54,083
<i>What an overwhelming moment
for everyone.</i>

770
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:59,792
<i>Join us and give him
a round of applause.</i>

771
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:09,000
I'm so proud of you, Greenie.

772
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:12,583
I congratulate you
as the new guard duck!

773
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:14,000
Thank you!

774
01:14:16,125 --> 01:14:19,750
Your flying skills are great.
Congratulations, kid.

775
01:14:19,917 --> 01:14:22,458
Call me Greenie.
That's my name.

776
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,250
Gotcha, Greenie kid.

777
01:15:32,542 --> 01:15:33,708
Good job.

778
01:15:35,333 --> 01:15:36,292
Thank you, sir.

779
01:15:37,458 --> 01:15:41,083
Our long journey starts
soon. So eat up!

780
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:54,625
Chief, I need to go
somewhere for just a bit.

781
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:57,917
As a guard, you should
never abandon your post!

782
01:15:58,042 --> 01:16:00,167
Please, I'll be right back.

783
01:16:00,917 --> 01:16:02,958
We'll be leaving soon,
so don't be late!

784
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:03,750
Yes, sir!

785
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:52,042
Is anyone there?

786
01:17:46,292 --> 01:17:50,958
Hey, Mayor, look here.
This place looks drafty...

787
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:55,083
Hey, everyone wants to
live in the brier patch.

788
01:17:55,292 --> 01:17:58,458
Besides, this place suits you.
I can tell just by looking.

789
01:17:58,708 --> 01:18:01,583
And when it rains?

790
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:03,458
I hate getting wet.

791
01:18:03,625 --> 01:18:04,875
Jeez...

792
01:18:05,292 --> 01:18:07,667
Then, what about the
bat cave on the hill?

793
01:18:07,792 --> 01:18:08,875
That place is empty.

794
01:18:10,292 --> 01:18:13,125
But, won't it be dark
in the cave?

795
01:18:13,583 --> 01:18:16,458
- I live on my own...
- Are you kidding me!

796
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:19,833
Then find a new realtor
or go back to the yard!

797
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:21,125
I don't want to!

798
01:18:21,292 --> 01:18:24,042
I'm now the rooster
who left the yard.

799
01:18:27,167 --> 01:18:29,833
- Mr. Mayor.
- Why isn't it the new guard duck!

800
01:18:30,167 --> 01:18:32,458
What brings you're here?
Aren't you leaving soon?

801
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:35,250
Have you seen my mom?

802
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:39,750
Well I've been a bit busy
today that... huh?

803
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:43,417
Why that little brat!

804
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:47,000
- Uncle.
- Huh?

805
01:18:47,542 --> 01:18:50,417
Please take good care of my mom.

806
01:18:51,833 --> 01:18:53,000
All right.

807
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:56,708
Come back safely!

808
01:19:33,792 --> 01:19:36,375
Leave her alone, you beast!

809
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,958
- Get off me!
- Greenie!

810
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:52,250
Mom?

811
01:19:54,792 --> 01:19:56,250
What are you doing there?!

812
01:19:56,458 --> 01:19:57,958
- Greenie!
- Don't come near!

813
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:08,542
No! Watch out!

814
01:20:09,083 --> 01:20:11,458
Get away from my babies!

815
01:20:12,958 --> 01:20:14,250
Babies?

816
01:20:15,875 --> 01:20:18,625
These are you babies?

817
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:27,708
Mom.

818
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:37,125
- Leave my baby alone!
- Leave my babies alone!

819
01:20:40,542 --> 01:20:41,583
Just leave them, now!

820
01:20:43,625 --> 01:20:45,292
My Greenie has to leave...

821
01:20:45,833 --> 01:20:47,417
With his flock...

822
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:49,000
Let him go!

823
01:20:49,125 --> 01:20:52,000
Let my babies go!

824
01:20:54,042 --> 01:20:54,792
Fine!

825
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:57,125
I'll let them go first.

826
01:20:57,458 --> 01:20:59,792
Then you let my
Greenie go as well.

827
01:21:09,917 --> 01:21:13,875
- Now let him go!
- All right, all right!

828
01:21:14,917 --> 01:21:15,875
- Greenie.
- Mom.

829
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:16,792
Are you okay?

830
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:18,750
Yes, I'm fine.

831
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,458
You must be hungry.
Just wait a little.

832
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:25,250
Once I hunt,
I'll be able to nurse.

833
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:27,458
My babies.

834
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:34,458
Let's go! Hurry!

835
01:22:07,042 --> 01:22:10,292
Hey, guard! What're you
doing there?!

836
01:22:11,333 --> 01:22:12,208
We have to go!

837
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:14,625
You have to lead us!

838
01:22:16,542 --> 01:22:17,500
What? Oh, right.

839
01:22:22,750 --> 01:22:23,500
Mom...

840
01:22:24,125 --> 01:22:27,208
I can't just leave you
here like this.

841
01:22:29,833 --> 01:22:33,708
I'm fine. I have enough
memories to cherish.

842
01:22:35,333 --> 01:22:37,417
<i>I remember when you hatched.</i>

843
01:22:37,542 --> 01:22:41,792
<i>When you swam, and
when you flew the skies.</i>

844
01:22:43,125 --> 01:22:45,875
When I close my eyes,
I can see you clearly.

845
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,250
So, I'm not lonely.

846
01:22:47,417 --> 01:22:51,083
Mom, do you really
want me to leave?

847
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:58,167
If I could fly, I would
never stay here.

848
01:22:59,125 --> 01:23:00,875
You've got to do what
your heart tells you.

849
01:23:01,417 --> 01:23:05,083
Greenie, go out and
see the wide world.

850
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:07,083
Mom...

851
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,833
I promise I'll come back.

852
01:23:12,958 --> 01:23:14,333
You'll be waiting for me, right?

853
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:17,542
Of course.

854
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:20,417
Your mom's not going anywhere.

855
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:22,625
Come back to tell me

856
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:28,125
what the world
you've seen is like.

857
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:29,917
Okay.

858
01:23:30,583 --> 01:23:33,833
I'll come back as the highest flying

859
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:35,917
and the bravest wild duck.

860
01:23:38,167 --> 01:23:40,625
I'll come back after
I see the wide world, mom.

861
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:42,125
Yes...

862
01:23:42,958 --> 01:23:44,250
my baby.

863
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:48,417
You're already the bravest
to me, my baby.

864
01:23:49,333 --> 01:23:50,292
Mom!

865
01:23:50,958 --> 01:23:52,000
Greenie.

866
01:24:20,292 --> 01:24:21,375
Take care!

867
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:27,167
Bye, mom!

868
01:24:35,208 --> 01:24:38,750
I'm so proud of you, Greenie!

869
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,250
