1
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,760
Well.

2
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,672
It would be slow.

3
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,474
Gentle as a dream.

4
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,873
An object thrown
into the unknown.

5
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,079
It could be called...

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,072
It would be called...

7
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,469
Dreaming Films

8
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,920
Some films are silent

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,316
and some films speak,

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,477
some films act

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,560
and some films watch.

12
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,916
There are films of memories

13
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,271
and memories of films.

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,275
Some films have shut eyes,

15
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,830
others open them.

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,756
Some films say goodbye,

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,640
others say farewell.

18
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,075
Some films tell no story,

19
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,756
others tell a story.

20
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,397
Some films laugh,

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,957
and others cry.

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,437
Some films take the gods'
point of view,

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,911
some take man's point of view.

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,836
Some films travel,

25
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,790
others stay put.

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,191
Some films remember,

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,509
others forget.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,833
Finally, there are
the films I dreamed

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,513
then made...

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,589
and the films I dreamed
but never made.

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,679
These are the dream films.

32
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,312
It would be the story of a film

33
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,394
that starts in a cabin
and ends with a storm,

34
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,357
a sand storm,

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,117
or a wind storm,

36
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,117
or a sea storm,

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,597
but a real storm.

38
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,393
One day...

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,355
One day, a man...

40
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,513
One day, a man, a filmmaker...

41
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,075
One day, a man, a filmmaker
had a dream.

42
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,191
He dreamed of making a film

43
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,273
that would contain all the films
he had dreamed of making.

44
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,398
Imaginary Map
of Dream Film Territories.

45
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,834
It is the dream of a child

46
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,320
who was told the story of Ulysses,

47
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,435
that fragile man,
who was clever, who lied,

48
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,831
who travelled so far
from his loved ones.

49
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,552
Ulysses,
this <i>is</i> the first journey.

50
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,557
It would all start in Troy,

51
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,800
for it was there,
under the great walls,

52
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,276
that the great hero Achilles died,

53
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,836
and from there that Ulysses
left on his great odyssey,

54
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,874
preferring the sea and adventure

55
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,709
over the heroism of battle.

56
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,074
The film would show his journey,

57
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,232
the strange islands he passes,
beautiful and unsettling,

58
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,671
like the Island of the Sirens.

59
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,235
But above all,

60
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,636
there would be the island
where he washes up alone,

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,832
that of the beautiful Calypso,

62
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,555
the goddess
who falls in love with him

63
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,520
and keeps him seven long years
by her side.

64
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,634
She promises him immortality,
paradise,

65
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,558
but Ulysses leaves,

66
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,749
because to journey is to leave
and to return,

67
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,749
because he loves the passing of time.

68
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,278
And he returns to Ithaca,

69
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,790
where his wife and son await him,

70
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,114
where his dog, Argos,
also awaits

71
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,872
and who will be
the first to recognize him.

72
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,829
Then there is Rouch, the traveller,

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,230
the filmmaker, the master,

74
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,913
for whom films
are about sharing,

75
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,396
a 'potlatch', as he used to say.

76
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,158
A few years ago,

77
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,074
Rouch came to my home

78
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,317
and Boris, another filmmaker

79
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,831
had come to film him,
get him to talk about cinema.

80
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,720
What we do is improvise,

81
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,318
which means being able to move around,

82
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,552
get up and go to look at an insect,
whatever.

83
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,398
All the rest...
the image doesn't matter a bit.

84
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,877
The image will be good
if it means something.

85
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,076
But focusing and all that,
I don't believe in it.

86
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,358
So that's what it is

87
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,195
and the only one capable
of filming and understanding

88
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,913
is that little dog.

89
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,637
He has his camera in his nose.

90
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,800
He looks with his nose,
his sense of smell.

91
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,311
Filming is like playing with a dog.

92
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,030
You throw something he likes

93
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,672
that he can bring back to you.
That's cinema.

94
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
Thank you.

95
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,676
Great sequence.

96
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,918
Great sequence!

97
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,877
Because you too thought of
the cinema, a film,

98
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,149
as a strange object
flung into the unknown,

99
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,550
which comes back to you later.

100
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,911
Could you define 'potlatch'?

101
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,551
Potlatch means sharing surplus.

102
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,398
We all have a surplus of dreams,

103
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,277
of means, of food, etc.,
that we must share.

104
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,077
One thing I feel is essential
is necessary waste.

105
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,116
One must waste one's energy
and one's riches,

106
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,954
on one condition,

107
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,114
that you do so with people
who will do the same in their turn.

108
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,835
Then one day, by phone,

109
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,079
a friend told me of his death
in an accident,

110
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,153
one night on a road in Niger.

111
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,952
I didn't know what to say.

112
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,112
I grabbed my camera and filmed,

113
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,470
dreamed these images for him.

114
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,073
When Jean Rouch died,
a legend was born:

115
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,679
Mahatma the spirit,
Mahatma the Touareg,

116
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,389
had snatched his soul.

117
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,630
And I dream of seeking it out.

118
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,713
But how do you seek,

119
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,556
how do you show a soul?

120
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,196
In Polynesia, the soul
is represented by the ray.

121
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,755
One day,

122
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,476
a traveller came, with
a portrait by Raphael.

123
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,872
When he showed it
to four old men on an island,

124
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,509
where the art of portrait painting
was unknown,

125
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,873
they all said: "Magnificent.
Yes, we recognize it."

126
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,636
Intrigued, the traveller
asked what they saw.

127
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,675
They all replied: "A ray!"

128
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,071
I dream of going to place
this covvry on Jean's tomb

129
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,793
and I dream of seeking his soul.

130
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,155
Legend has it that Arrako Gikko,
the river spirit,

131
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,836
Mahatma the Touareg's mother,

132
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,877
took back Jean's soul.

133
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,189
Legend has it that his soul has
become the guardian spirit of the river,

134
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,836
in this loop of the Niger
where hippopotamuses swim,

135
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,633
where he lived,

136
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,158
worked and filmed all his life.

137
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,556
This is where Rouch
made his first film.

138
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,155
When he shared it,
screening it for the locals,

139
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,711
the Sorko fishermen
asked him to take out the music,

140
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,719
so as not to frighten
the hippopotamuses.

141
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,269
One day, Stany came to visit,

142
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,439
before leaving to sail around the world.

143
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,793
He left,

144
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,670
promising to bring back images
for me to dream on.

145
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,389
Look,
it's the little blue tortoise

146
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,359
I found on the beach that day.

147
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,031
It was just before I left
to sail around the world.

148
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,429
Remember?

149
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,272
You asked me to set him free
in the land of the tortoises.

150
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,560
There's a film
I've always wanted to make,

151
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,356
something lodged within me
like the trace of a gaze.

152
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,070
I remember an adolescent

153
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,516
sitting at the table of a night club

154
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,110
astray in a foreign land.

155
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,318
I remember the sonata, her body,

156
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,399
the first woman's body
I ever saw.

157
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,237
I remember the atmosphere,

158
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,154
the smoke,

159
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,036
and what her gaze
said about the gaze of men.

160
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,479
We should evoke the travellers,
the sailors,

161
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,029
speak of those who left first,

162
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,357
of their leap into the unknown.

163
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,038
When a man like Columbus
leaves to discover America,

164
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,714
even those condemned to death
refuse a pardon

165
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,439
to leave with him.

166
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,955
But those sailors were the first
to sail far from land,

167
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,278
losing sight of it,
surrounded by water only.

168
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,950
And they knew
that whatever happened,

169
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,270
nobody would come to save them.

170
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,679
Those sailors made songs
about their fears

171
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,439
and their solitude.

172
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,075
Weeks, surrounded by the ocean,

173
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,633
believing they saw mermaids
rise from the water...

174
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,115
until the first signs of land.

175
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,438
The first thing they truly saw
of the new world

176
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,909
was this...

177
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
It was dark

178
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,070
and without realizing it,
they had come close

179
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,679
to the first island.

180
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,473
This is what they saw.

181
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,030
The next day,

182
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,391
they realized it was
the lights of the Indians

183
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,679
coming outside at night,
to relieve themselves.

184
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,836
The Indians believed the sailors
had come from the sky,

185
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,071
the sailors were certain
they had found paradise.

186
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,278
The mixed waters,
of different colours,

187
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,516
all around them,
proved them right,

188
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,197
they were indeed in paradise.

189
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,958
The world was thought to be
the shape of a pear.

190
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,479
Paradise was right at the top.

191
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,598
From this spring flowed
the four rivers known at the time.

192
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,353
It was therefore normal
that around paradise,

193
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,836
the waters be of mixed colours.

194
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,949
All this can be found
in Las Casas.

195
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,358
If a film were to be made
about one of the first travellers,

196
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
it would be him,

197
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,071
the churchman,
Bartholomew de las Casas.

198
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,716
He was Columbus's companion,

199
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,151
went on the first journeys

200
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,030
and told it all in his
amazing "History of the Indies".

201
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,071
Las Casas is wonderful.

202
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,236
When he pondered
the production of pearls,

203
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,074
which the sailors saw
for the first time,

204
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,076
he recounted that oysters
came onto the beach at night

205
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,597
and walked,
opening and closing their valve,

206
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,952
until they reached
the first blades of grass.

207
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,511
There, they lay down
and opened wide,

208
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,156
awaiting the first drop of morning dew,

209
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,432
which would later
become the pearl.

210
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,114
Then, the oysters would
quickly return to the sea.

211
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,479
When he reached Cuba,

212
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,871
the first big island
they discovered,

213
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,758
Las Casas wrote:

214
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,120
"They saw nightingales
singing very softly,

215
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,749
and it is good to think there's a land
where nightingales sing in November."

216
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,434
But Cuba

217
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,510
was also the first experiment
in enslavement,

218
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,111
for wherever the white man
thought he had found heaven,

219
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,351
he turned it into a hell.

220
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,192
Las Casas tells stories
from another point of view,

221
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,433
as with the first Indian rebellion.

222
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,869
The Spanish had just arrived
on the island of Cuba

223
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,589
and went on land to celebrate.

224
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,594
They left 8 crew members on board,

225
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,229
to guard the Indians
they had taken prisoner.

226
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,118
But the latter rebelled,
killed their guards,

227
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,837
raised the anchors
and left with the ship.

228
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,954
From the shore,

229
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,875
the Spaniards watched them
disappear into the horizon.

230
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,955
Cuba brought the discovery
of tobacco.

231
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,671
The first to bring it back to Europe
were excommunicated.

232
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,596
Las Casas talks of "pipes of smells",

233
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,275
of "
it comets, full of scented herbs

234
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,795
that intoxicate
and lull the body to sleep."

235
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,034
Later, it was in these places,

236
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,317
while tobacco was rolled,

237
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,070
that Alexander Dumas'
"Count of Monte Cristo"

238
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,556
was read out loud, for years.

239
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,913
I read it as a child,

240
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,550
looking at the picture of Danton,

241
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,030
trapped in the hell of his prison.

242
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,076
Dreaming a film based on blue.

243
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,675
The blue of the sea
and the blue of the sky.

244
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,558
Blue, the color of eternity,
of paradise,

245
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,396
the world of before, where men and
animals spoke the same language

246
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,834
and lived in peace.

247
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,838
In Ulysses' era,
the Masters of Time wore blue.

248
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,638
And finding near this little town
at the "edge of the world",

249
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,069
as Ulysses called it,

250
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,751
the island of Calypso,
whence he set off to join his family.

251
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,189
He returns and Argos awaits him.

252
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,839
Home at last,

253
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,638
but one day,
Ulysses would leave once more.

254
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,799
The first man to go to paradise

255
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,238
and come back

256
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,710
was Lucian of Samosata.

257
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,071
Around 180 A.D.,

258
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,800
Lucian made the first trip
to the moon.

259
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,633
On his way back,
he stopped off in paradise.

260
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,516
He saw cities of gold and rubies,

261
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,712
temples of emeralds and diamonds

262
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,076
bathed in an eternal dawn.

263
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,355
The ears of corn
bore little loaves,

264
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,559
there were fountains of honey,
milk and wine.

265
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,074
Here, souls once again
took on a human shape

266
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,919
and Lucian described
his meeting with Ulysses,

267
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,960
who gave him a letter
for Calypso.

268
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,557
In the story, in ancient Greek,

269
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,956
Lucian repeats Ulysses' words:

270
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,271
"Now that I am in paradise,

271
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,599
I miss the pleasures
we had together.

272
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,800
I wish I had always stayed
by your side,

273
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,709
and accepted your offer
of immortality.

274
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,715
If I can escape, rest assured,
you will see me again.

275
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,959
Farewell, Ulysses."

276
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,632
Then there's the paradise
my mother described,

277
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,278
the paradise she saw as a child

278
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,916
and wanted to return to.

279
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,711
Sometimes, we spent the afternoon
at my grandparents'...

280
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,440
Sometimes, we spent the afternoon
at my grandparents',

281
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,433
not far from our home.

282
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,717
Their red brick house

283
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,514
was surrounded
by a magnificent garden

284
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,189
containing all sorts of flowers,

285
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,395
fruit trees, redcurrants,
and raspberries.

286
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,592
I imagined I was in
the Garden of Eden.

287
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,076
And under the apple tree,

288
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,437
I saw Eve hold out the apple
to Adam,

289
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,798
the snake that curled around the tree,

290
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,195
then the Good Lord chasing them
out of the Garden of Eden

291
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,314
into the big wasteland

292
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,712
just opposite my grandparents' place.

293
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,077
A friend sends me a postcard
from Las Casas in Mexico.

294
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,475
Bartholomew de las Casas
stayed here for years.

295
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,431
The Indians named the city after him

296
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,196
because he was the first
to defend them,

297
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,510
to say they had a soul,

298
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,874
just as he was the first

299
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,640
to question the role
of the White man,

300
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,113
the first to say
you must not dream for others.

301
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,550
It would be the story of a man,

302
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,513
a traveller,

303
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,474
who spent his life
filming railway tracks,

304
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,831
endlessly fleeing,

305
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,313
all over the world.

306
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,310
In the 16th century,

307
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,393
the Mughal Emperor Babar wrote:

308
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,116
"If paradise on earth exists,

309
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,590
it is here, in Kashmir."

310
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,437
Across these Himalayan landscapes,

311
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,631
the Frenchman, Bonin, set off.

312
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,073
After several attempts,

313
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,791
in 1900, he finally became
the first Westerner to reach Tibet.

314
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,918
After a crazy journey,

315
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,796
he neared Koko Nor,
the Great Blue Lake.

316
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,753
In his notes,
ever more enthusiastic,

317
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,078
he described the mad night winds,
the rooftop of the world,

318
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,954
the tribes of nomadic Mongols
and Tibetans

319
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,391
travelling in thousands
to visit Genghis Khan's tomb,

320
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,238
to pay tribute to him.

321
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,550
But today,

322
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,797
all researchers agree

323
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,871
that there is not,
nor ever has been,

324
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,670
neither there, nor anywhere else,
a tomb to Genghis Khan.

325
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:35,034
Could his whole journey
have been but a dream?

326
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,591
There's a film to be made
about Magellan,

327
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,432
about the man and his crazy project
to be the first to travel around the world.

328
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,038
The world was known to be round

329
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,430
and much bigger than first thought,

330
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,030
but no one was sure
a passage existed

331
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,551
south of South America,
to go all the way round.

332
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,074
No one knew.

333
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,758
Magellan, without knowing
if he'd ever return

334
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,510
charters a fleet and sets off.

335
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,030
Five ships leave
the European continent

336
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,720
on September 20th, 1519.

337
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,198
After three years of travelling,

338
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,789
only one ship
would return to Spain.

339
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,352
All along South America,

340
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,639
ever more doubtful,
Magellan seeks the passage.

341
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,156
The fleet weathers storm after storm,

342
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,680
suffers a mutiny,

343
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,712
one boat founders on a reef,

344
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,514
another deserts
and returns to Europe,

345
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,872
but Magellan perseveres.

346
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,394
It took him over a year

347
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,959
to reach the passage,

348
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,112
which would later be named
the Strait of Magellan.

349
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,120
There,

350
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,670
after months without seeing
a living soul,

351
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,358
they spotted the Patagonian Indians
on the shore,

352
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,113
clothed in animal pelts.

353
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,159
But they fled
when they approached.

354
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,274
At night, they saw their fires

355
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,191
and called the desolate shore,
Land of Fire.

356
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,196
The Patagonian Indians
were the last ones

357
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,079
to travel down South America

358
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,675
in their migration
to the end of the earth,

359
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,834
carrying with them
the dream culture

360
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,077
common to all Amerindian peoples.

361
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,398
The lnextiua celebration

362
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,280
is the rite when
one seeks one's destiny.

363
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,592
Here is what a 16th century monk
had to say about it:

364
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,832
"During this feast,
they said all the gods were dancing,

365
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,955
so all those dancing
dressed up as various characters,

366
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,834
some as birds, others as animals

367
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,509
and some metamorphosed
into butterflies,

368
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,950
others into bees or beetles.

369
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:25,556
Still others carried a sleeping man
on their back,

370
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,309
saying it was the Dream..."

371
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,878
For Magellan's crew,

372
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,430
the ordeal of the Pacific
was awful.

373
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,076
Three months of sailing
with no sight of land.

374
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,518
Many died of hunger

375
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,229
before reaching the heavenly islands.

376
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,072
They were welcomed like gods.

377
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,437
But everywhere they went,
despite Magellan's orders,

378
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,599
the sailors couldn't resist
the island girls

379
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,350
and sowed discord
wherever they went.

380
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,356
He who wrote the tale
of the journey,

381
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,477
tells us:
"In exchange for one knife,

382
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,235
you get two or three girls,
whose only clothing is their hair,

383
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,750
and this for a lifetime."

384
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:57,472
In the Philippines, Magellan was killed
in an expedition against a local lord.

385
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,069
The ship then sailed on,

386
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,391
and set course for Europe.

387
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,274
Months later, only one ship

388
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,313
and 18 sailors made it to Spain.

389
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,435
But none of them
was the first to sail around the world,

390
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,631
as History would have it.

391
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,796
The first man to sail around the world,

392
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,311
of whom no portrait exists,

393
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,440
was Enrique, Magellan's slave,

394
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,758
companion, and shadow.

395
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,273
A native of Malaysia,

396
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,440
Enrique had followed his master all over,
even on his trip around the world.

397
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,112
But in the Sunda Islands,
Enrique's mother tongue is spoken

398
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,272
and he acts as interpreter,
Magellan is killed

399
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,438
and Enrique disappears.

400
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,477
I imagine Enrique
back on his island,

401
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,440
grown old,

402
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,797
far from the history of the world.

403
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,509
He dreams of the story of Serrao,
whom he knew so well...

404
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,355
Many reasons have been given
to explain Magellan's attempted world tour.

405
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,672
Perhaps Serrao is the explanation.

406
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,679
Ferdinand de Magellan
and Francisco Serrao

407
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,590
had been close friends for years.

408
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:45,434
In 1512, Serrao leaves
for the Maluku Islands via the Indies.

409
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,917
On his way back, his ship
founders on a reef

410
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,831
but he survives and returns
to the Maluku Islands.

411
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,355
There, forgetting Portugal
and the spice trade,

412
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,760
Serrao and his crew desert
and stay in this endless paradise.

413
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:09,190
Serrao will not be remembered
as a great conquistador,

414
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:12,917
but perhaps this Ulysses,
enamored of his Calypso,

415
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,317
was the wisest
and happiest of captains.

416
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,152
Serrao remained there 9 years
and had three children

417
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,080
before dying the same year
as Magellan,

418
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,158
and not so very far from him.

419
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,191
For years, Serrao
on his far-off island

420
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,393
corresponded with Magellan
as he prepared his trip.

421
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,031
Yes, his friend
described the delights of paradise

422
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,790
and invited him
to come and join him there.

423
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,678
Meanwhile,
Stany continues his voyage.

424
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,672
He has passed
the Strait of Magellan

425
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,196
and is heading towards
Easter Island.

426
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:40,670
Every day, he notes
his latitude and longitude.

427
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:45,712
Every day, he draws the sky and the sea
at that moment.

428
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,678
With his filmed images of the sea,
he sends me these drawings.

429
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,914
It's the most isolated land
on the planet,

430
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,953
the last land to be colonized
by humanity.

431
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,793
The Polynesians,
coming from the Marquesas Islands,

432
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,795
travelled thousands of kilometers,
following migratory birds,

433
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,516
and stopped on this island.

434
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,873
After the longest known
maritime odyssey,

435
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,875
they felt they had found paradise,
the belly button of the world,

436
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:35,317
a land for the spirits
of the ancestors.

437
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:46,156
But in the 17th century,
all the island's trees died of drought

438
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,399
and the inhabitants,
no longer having ships,

439
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,030
were prisoners
of their paradise,

440
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,636
a tiny dot in the ocean.

441
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,957
Stany sets sail
for the Galapagos Islands

442
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,835
to drop off the blue tortoise
in the land of tortoises.

443
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,392
A swallow signals
that land is close.

444
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,752
The swallow
is the bird of paradise,

445
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,640
a symbol of migration

446
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,911
and the return of the soul.

447
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,510
There are so many
images of journeys

448
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,394
and so few of those
who stay behind.

449
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,189
So few of those who stay behind
and dream their journeys.

450
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,714
Trying to capture the invisible,

451
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:52,439
that which is archaic
in a mother's relationship with her child.

452
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,755
Filming the imperceptible mirror.

453
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:21,149
Jean-Marie,
neighbour and friend.

454
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,430
His balcony overlooks my garden.

455
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:30,237
From one institution to another,
Jean-Marie's life has not been easy.

456
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,838
He never travels.

457
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,272
He often stays home,
in his little apartment,

458
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,838
he whose heart
is as big as a house.

459
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,433
He comes around
to chat of this and that,

460
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,439
of you and me,

461
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,758
of this film that's sprouting
and growing like a plant,

462
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,639
like a tree.

463
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,315
We dream and we film.

464
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,756
We dream and record sound.

465
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:10,434
And one day we say: "Ah,
there's the film I desire."

466
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,879
Jean-Marie is part of the waking dreams,

467
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:17,072
of the dream films.

468
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,391
Is the image OK, like that?
- Yes.

469
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,437
Like this I've just got your head.

470
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,680
Don't you think you should
do it properly,

471
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,757
the whole thing?
- Like that, yes.

472
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,713
It's much better.

473
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,314
You mustn't change the image.

474
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,789
You must leave the image
the way you filmed it.

475
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,674
Otherwise,

476
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,112
your image of the person filmed

477
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,111
will break his heart

478
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,353
and that of the person
who filmed.

479
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,270
I think lots of people

480
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,156
no longer have respect for that,

481
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,593
for that profession.

482
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,951
They lack respect
for themselves,

483
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:13,034
because they want
the person to change,

484
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,753
to show something other
than what they really are.

485
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,833
And that's impossible.

486
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,795
Is this OK?
- Yes, that's fine.

487
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,109
I wondered if you
believe in paradise

488
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,358
and above all,
how you imagine it to be.

489
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,394
Well, imagining paradise!

490
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,158
Everyone has their own take

491
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,115
on paradise.

492
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,352
It's just that

493
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,520
we get the wrong impression

494
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,520
sometimes.

495
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,751
Sometimes, we're even disappointed.

496
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,118
And if it's a disappointment,

497
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,513
it's not worth it.

498
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,311
That's why giving an image
of paradise

499
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:12,557
is beyond any person.

500
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,833
On the map, I show Jean-Marie

501
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,795
James Bruce's journey in Abyssinia.

502
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:30,717
In the 18th century,
Bruce, a noble Scot,

503
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,514
also called the "Marco Polo of Africa",

504
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:38,915
decided to go looking for
the petrified town of Ras Sem.

505
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:42,194
Legend has it that
the inhabitants have been frozen

506
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,836
for centuries, like statues,

507
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,914
in the position they were in
when God's wrath fell on them.

508
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,359
He wrote down his adventures
and illustrated them himself.

509
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:00,593
Bruce crossing a waterfall
in search of the source of the Blue Nile.

510
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:07,634
Bruce dressed as an Arab,
bowing to the Emperor of Abyssinia.

511
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:14,277
Bruce pays tribute to the
favourite wife of the King of Sennam.

512
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,309
After an incredible journey
of four years,

513
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,353
braving death countless times,
grown rich,

514
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,195
then robbed by bandits,
he finally returned to Cairo,

515
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:30,916
in rags, a mere ghost.

516
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,638
Many claimed his tale
was pure invention,

517
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,554
that he had never set foot
in Africa.

518
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,753
But the truth was never known.

519
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:51,672
One of the most extraordinary
travel tales is that of Rougemont.

520
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,871
Louis de Rougemont, a Frenchman,
is shipwrecked with pearl hunters

521
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:01,351
in the 19th century,
off the coast of Australia.

522
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,394
He finds himself alone
in an unknown land

523
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:09,669
where he will spend 30 eventful years
in the Australian outback.

524
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,349
He is miraculously saved
during the shipwreck,

525
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,878
helped by his dog,
now his sole companion.

526
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,274
He tames turtles.

527
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:24,670
He finds an Aborigine partner
who takes care of him.

528
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,831
He becomes chief of a cannibal tribe
that he leads into war

529
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,400
against his enemies.

530
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,151
He saves two young English girls

531
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:36,438
from the clutches of the natives.

532
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:39,791
But everyone dies

533
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,756
and alone he finds his way back
to civilization.

534
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,590
He becomes famous and his book
is translated all over the world.

535
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:57,670
But gradually, as the episodes
of his story appear,

536
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:01,396
month by month, his story
is called into question.

537
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,677
It seems this incredible
30-year crossing of Australia

538
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,070
had been invented.

539
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,080
Even his identity
was apparently fake.

540
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:15,952
Rumour had it that
he had invented his tales

541
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:21,109
in the reading room of the British Museum,
surrounded by the travel stories he loved.

542
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:27,073
Rougemont disappeared
as mysteriously as he had appeared.

543
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:34,191
A sole witness later claimed
he had seen a bearded tramp

544
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,518
selling matchsticks
in the streets of London.

545
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,717
It seems his whole story was fake...

546
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:47,551
<i>Perhaps. For here, another man
enters the picture". Lander,</i>

547
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,510
the Englishman, Savage Landor,

548
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,872
the man who went three times
around the world.

549
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:59,430
He discovers Tibet
around the same time as Bonin,

550
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,751
crosses frozen peaks alone,

551
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:04,190
and, pursued by an army of 2000,

552
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,069
climbs the Himalayas
without equipment.

553
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,953
Then he continues
to travel the world.

554
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,957
He crosses the African jungle
from west to east,

555
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,590
journeys down South America,

556
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,919
travels all over North America,

557
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,077
and sets sail for Japan,

558
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,154
where he disappears
into 6000 km of dense forest.

559
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,320
Many of his trips
were called into question

560
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,638
and doubt was cast
over his extravagant adventures,

561
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:42,511
but publishers fought for his manuscripts
and Landor became famous.

562
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:48,389
He was a good drawer
and he sketched landscapes,

563
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,718
and portraits of people
he met on his travels.

564
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,511
After Japan,
he set sail for Korea

565
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:01,554
and crossed China
before arriving in Australia.

566
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,314
And there,
at the end of his journey,

567
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:08,758
it would appear that
Rougemont's extraordinary adventure

568
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:12,072
crossed Landor's path.

569
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:17,671
Landor met and made a portrait
of an Australian adventurer

570
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,231
whose face strongly resembles
that of Rougemont.

571
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:27,551
If this really is Rougemont,
as is supposed,

572
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:33,231
and if Landor really did go there
and met him,

573
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:38,959
then Rougemont's whole story
could also be true...

574
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:27,511
Then there's the story
of the forger, Van Megeren.

575
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,634
All his life, he painted Vermeers,

576
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:35,031
fakes, of course,
but not copies,

577
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,755
paintings one could imagine
Vermeer might have done.

578
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,918
Everyone was dupe.
He even sold a canvas

579
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:45,795
to Marshall Goering,
a great art lover.

580
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:50,436
When the Americans found the painting
at the end of the war,

581
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,070
they traced it back to Van Megeren.

582
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:58,435
He was tried
and risked the death penalty

583
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,035
for having sold a Vermeer
to the enemy.

584
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,517
Van Megeren denied the charge,

585
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:08,475
claiming he had conned Goering
by selling him a fake.

586
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,515
But the experts were unanimous,

587
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:15,640
this, and the other Vermeers,
were genuine.

588
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:21,234
So, to prove the truth
and save his life

589
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,878
Van Megeren painted a fake Vermeer
in his prison cell,

590
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,630
and was set free.

591
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,558
Long ago,

592
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:48,479
in the beginning,

593
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,993
in paradise,

594
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,911
men and animals lived together
and spoke the same language.

595
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:55,718
There are many animals in the garden,

596
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,510
but mostly, there are frogs.

597
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:04,590
They're the only ones I know,
but they're incredibly curious.

598
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,350
In all cultures, everywhere,

599
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,439
stories tell of the breakdown

600
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:25,236
of equality between
animals and humans.

601
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:31,159
Ours is that of Noah
and the story of the flood.

602
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:37,996
When the floods came,
Noah saved those animals he could.

603
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,713
But when he got back to land
after his journey,

604
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:45,999
for no good reason,
he became a carnivore,

605
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:48,072
thus breaking his pact.

606
01:13:54,800 --> 01:14:00,398
It brings to mind a story
my granda told me when I was little.

607
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,720
When God at last finished creating
the world and all things,

608
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:08,715
he created heaven.

609
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:13,235
But one day, the animals,
all the animals,

610
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:17,553
came together, because they too
wanted to go to heaven.

611
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,711
So, they sent representatives
to God.

612
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,716
And God said perhaps they were right

613
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,111
since He had created them,

614
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:32,435
but that He would not tolerate
dirt in His home.

615
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,709
Time passed, heaven
was starting to fill up,

616
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:41,078
and now
all sorts of animals were there.

617
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:46,116
But one day,
the inevitable happened.

618
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,315
God walked in some poop.

619
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:53,189
Furious,
he gathered everyone together

620
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:56,552
and asked:
"Who pooped in my Heaven?"

621
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:01,872
As no one replied,
God repeated loudly:

622
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:05,716
"I'm warning you,
I know about droppings.

623
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,509
This was clearly done by a dog.

624
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:11,514
May that dog come forward,

625
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,720
or I'll throw all the dogs
out of heaven, forever!"

626
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:20,196
But the dogs all
glared at each other

627
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,914
and none of them came forward.

628
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,039
So God banished them
from heaven, once and for all.

629
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:34,193
"That is why,"
my grandfather said,

630
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,836
"When one dog meets another,

631
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,992
he sniffs his backside and asks:

632
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:44,478
'Surely you're not the one,
who pooped in paradise?"'

633
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,469
I don't know if animals
have a soul,

634
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,834
or the extent of their awareness,

635
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,279
but I know they dream.

636
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,789
We are surrounded
by strange animals

637
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,557
and we all pick our own.

638
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,035
Ulysses was pursued
by bird-mermaids.

639
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:08,438
But there are all sorts
of mermaids.

640
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:13,037
When I sang that,
I dressed up as a mermaid.

641
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,790
I don't know why I went to dance

642
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:21,715
In St. Jean,
At the popular dances.

643
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,753
But all it took was one kiss,

644
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:28,510
For my heart
To be taken prisoner.

645
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,031
How could I not lose my mind,

646
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:35,272
Wrapped in those daring arms?

647
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:38,472
For we always believe,
Those sweet words of love

648
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,838
When they're spoken
With the eyes.

649
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,470
I, who loved him so,

650
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,996
Thought him the most handsome
In St. Jean.

651
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:50,590
I was drunk,

652
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,216
Powerless before his kisses.

653
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:58,234
Then there's Jacobson's mermaid,
in Denmark.

654
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:03,313
Jacobson was the youngest member
of a family of brewers, the Jacobsons.

655
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,919
From a young age,
he had a rebellious nature.

656
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,918
As soon as he could,
he founded his own brewery,

657
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:17,074
Carlsberg beer,
and made a fortune.

658
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,391
In the final years of his life,

659
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:54,797
he went to the theatre
to see a ballet,

660
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,520
The Little Mermaid,
based on a fairy tale

661
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,149
where a young mermaid
wants to marry a man

662
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:03,193
and become a human being

663
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,399
because her mermaid grandmother
had told her

664
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,918
that men live shorter lives,
but have an eternal soul.

665
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:16,316
Old Jacobson fell in love with
the young performer, Ellen Price.

666
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,996
It was to her memory
that he commissioned the statue

667
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:24,080
that now stands
at the entrance to Copenhagen port.

668
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:50,557
Regarding animals,
there is one story,

669
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:54,031
a true one,
that I would like to film.

670
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,036
It's about a pigeon.

671
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,712
Well, in the beginning,
it's about a man,

672
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,116
somewhere in England,

673
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,552
who loved pigeons,
loved to watch them fly,

674
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,757
and sent them on journeys.

675
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,355
One day, he sent a young pigeon
off on a journey.

676
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,430
Then awaited its return.

677
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,954
He waited four years.

678
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:52,996
One day, he got a phone call
from China.

679
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,994
His pigeon had got lost.

680
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,759
It was found 10,000 km from home,

681
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,837
in the Sichuan mountains.

682
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,433
In the end, after much discussion,

683
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,269
the Chinese decided
to let it leave...

684
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:49,273
by plane.

685
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:55,193
A Chinese air company
took charge of getting it home.

686
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:04,269
There, that was the tale
of the homing pigeon,

687
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:09,118
also known as
"the Ulysses of birds".

688
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,516
When William Winchester,

689
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,320
inventor of the Winchester rifle,

690
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,113
died in California,

691
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,353
he was busy building a new home

692
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:07,397
for himself and his wife, Sarah.

693
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,830
Soon, a legend was born:

694
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:16,192
as soon as the building
was finished,

695
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:19,279
it would be haunted by the souls
of the thousands of Indians

696
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:22,120
killed by the Winchester rifle.

697
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:29,714
Sarah, the widow,
believed the tale

698
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:34,755
and for 38 years, she did not stop
building the house

699
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:39,159
night and day,
which grew bigger and bigger.

700
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:45,557
In 1922, when she died,

701
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:49,199
the residence contained
over 950 doors,

702
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,717
leading to 160 rooms,

703
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:56,358
including 40 bedrooms
and 6 kitchens.

704
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,236
There should be a film
about the life of Curtis.

705
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:16,078
For over 35 years,

706
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:19,319
he photographed
the Indians of North America,

707
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,513
travelling from tribe to tribe.

708
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,550
His work includes
thousands of plates.

709
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,350
When White men, foreigners

710
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:43,752
who were building a railway
on Indian territory,

711
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,997
asked him

712
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:49,591
if they could hire some
young Indians of his tribe,

713
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:53,316
Smohalla, Indian chief, replied:

714
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,229
"My young men will never work.

715
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,354
Men who work cannot dream

716
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:02,872
and wisdom comes to us
through dreams."

717
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:08,551
In Canada, among the Kwakiutl tribe,
Curtis shot

718
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:12,158
one of the very first films
in the history of the cinema:

719
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:17,039
magical images of the return
of the animal masks.

720
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:37,516
The word 'potlatch'
comes from the Kwakiutls:

721
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,274
sharing, giving to another

722
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,472
who will later give back more.

723
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:00,039
Monarch butterflies
leave from Canada

724
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:03,876
and migrate 5000 km to Mexico.

725
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:09,712
I dream of following them
to the Huichol Indians.

726
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:16,711
It is the most mysterious
of all animal migrations.

727
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,712
Each butterfly,
which has never flown the route,

728
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:22,593
leaves alone.

729
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:26,119
Gradually,
it is joined by the others.

730
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:31,116
They arrive by millions
in the Mexican mountains.

731
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:59,040
Dreaming of going with
the Huichol Indians,

732
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:02,875
across the desert
in search of the sacred cactus.

733
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:08,714
A pilgrimage in search of peyote,

734
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:12,350
the hallucinogenic cactus
that guides their dreams

735
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,836
and imaginary journeys.

736
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,914
But there are times when
the strength of a dream,

737
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:07,509
of a desire, wakes you up,

738
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:10,719
and reality takes over...

739
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:15,431
Then you must get up and leave.

740
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:22,350
End of Part 1

741
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:29,838
Dreaming Films Part 2

742
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:36,993
There are times when
the strength of a dream,

743
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:39,390
of a desire, wakes you up

744
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:42,513
and reality takes over.

745
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:46,709
Then you must get up and leave.

746
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:53,794
There are imaginary places
one tries to mark on a map

747
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:56,151
to make them real.

748
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:00,990
And there are real,
terribly real places,

749
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,476
that one cannot forget
if one has been there,

750
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:07,594
and which figure on no maps,
so great is the shame.

751
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:12,031
The penal colony of Tazmamart

752
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:15,431
is not shown on any map
of Morocco.

753
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:25,229
Salah Hachad spent 18 years
in Tazmamart

754
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:29,439
in the Moroccan desert, freezing
in winter, stifling in summer,

755
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:34,231
wrongly accused for participating
in a coup against the king.

756
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:39,599
For 18 years, Salah Hachad
did not see the blue of the sky.

757
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:45,710
When I read his story,
I wanted to meet and film him.

758
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:53,476
If there was only one film,
it would be that one,

759
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,391
to tell the crumbling of time

760
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:59,115
and the resistance of human beings.

761
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:05,840
Filming this man
to speak of all men.

762
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:14,635
And I would get up
and go to see him.

763
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:18,152
He would show me
the cell he has recreated.

764
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:21,199
He would show me
how he managed to survive,

765
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:25,269
without going mad, or blind.

766
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:30,839
It took Salah Hachad 10 months

767
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:35,079
to make what the prisoners
codenamed the "Kabazal":

768
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:40,236
a little mirror set on the top
of palm stems fixed end to end.

769
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:43,995
Pushed through the air hole
in the ceiling,

770
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:47,711
the Kabazal,
in the total darkness of the cell,

771
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,558
saved his life.

772
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:53,878
Then, all of a sudden, barn!

773
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:57,034
Light came inside,

774
01:32:57,400 --> 01:33:00,199
a small, bright white spot.

775
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,429
I was euphoric.

776
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:06,154
I shouted and jumped, I cried.

777
01:33:06,360 --> 01:33:09,876
It was pure joy.
Ah, I see my hand!

778
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:13,312
It's hard to describe the emotion.
You're in the dark

779
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:16,359
for 10 months,
and all of a sudden,

780
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:19,399
you see a patch of light.

781
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:22,432
Salah Hachad resisted,

782
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,876
struggled, for 18 years,

783
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:28,153
but other prisoners
didn't have his strength

784
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,636
and dreamed their escape.

785
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,429
He started by telling me:
"You know, Captain,

786
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:35,995
it's easy to get out of Tazmamart.

787
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:38,555
All you have to do
is hang yourself,

788
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:42,031
they'll get you
and take you outside,

789
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:45,273
and then at night, you escape."

790
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:48,553
I understood then that he was...

791
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:52,237
He was no longer normal.

792
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:58,916
I told him: "If you carry on
talking like that, it's over between us!"

793
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:01,276
He said: "No, I'm only joking."

794
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:05,713
But in the end,
he carried out his plan.

795
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:09,470
He escaped.
- Yes, he escaped. It's true.

796
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:11,831
For him, it was an escape.

797
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:15,630
"I'll hang myself,
they'll put me outside

798
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:19,430
with the others."
For him, the others who had died

799
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:22,109
had escaped.

800
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,832
What struck me
was the power of the dream,

801
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:28,514
of the imagination.

802
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:32,037
At one point you say:
"I travel to my wife..."

803
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:35,353
It's not just the sexual aspect,

804
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:39,395
but even life itself.
Sometimes I would

805
01:34:41,080 --> 01:34:45,392
wrap myself up in my blanket,

806
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:48,997
like a Mexican,
and I'd close my eyes

807
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:52,432
and hup, I'd go outside
and start

808
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:57,997
to live outside,
on a farm, making plans...

809
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,911
For years, he planned
his imaginary farm:

810
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:06,272
the various buildings,
the electrical circuits,

811
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:10,190
the animals in the yard,
the number of milk cows,

812
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:14,917
the number of fruit trees,
where they'd be planted.

813
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:19,438
One fine day, a little pigeon,

814
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:24,836
fresh out of its egg,
fell into the corridor.

815
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:29,069
And it was our friend, Marzouki...

816
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:34,033
The bird fell in front of his cell
just when they opened the door

817
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:38,677
for him to get his food.

818
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:41,714
He saw the pigeon and picked it up.

819
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:46,913
And that was it,
for months afterwards,

820
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:50,710
we lived for 'Mr. Farrach'.

821
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:53,116
Farrach means...

822
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:59,030
We chose the name Farrach
because it means 'liberty.

823
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,317
But his color...

824
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:05,394
Because there was no light,
he lived inside with us,

825
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:09,440
there was no sunlight,
he didn't go pigeon-coloured.

826
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:13,669
He stayed a weird color

827
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,673
due to lack of sunlight.

828
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,831
In the end, he grew strong.

829
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:20,430
We would open the little hatches

830
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:24,639
and Marzouki
would let Farrach go.

831
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:30,672
He would whizz up and down
the corridor at great speed,

832
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:34,549
from one comer to another.
We loved it!

833
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:39,436
When he passed, one after another
we'd put our hands

834
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:43,759
out of the hatch, and he'd come
and sit on them.

835
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:48,113
We'd stroke him and talk to him,
then he'd fly off again.

836
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:52,439
We had a great time with Farrach.

837
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:56,754
Then one day, we thought:
"Well, really,

838
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:02,597
we should let him go,
give him his liberty,

839
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,754
Farrach has grown."

840
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,673
So

841
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:13,079
It took almost
a whole day of debate,

842
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:16,278
serious debate. Some wanted
to keep him, others said:

843
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:21,714
"No, nothing is more
precious than liberty,

844
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,636
we must set him free."

845
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:28,629
Then Marzouki came
and passed him through...

846
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:32,919
Above the corridor between
the cells there was wire netting

847
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,759
made of barbed wire.

848
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:38,840
He pushed him through
and let him go.

849
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:43,229
But the terrible thing was
that the other pigeons

850
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:47,195
wanted nothing to do with him.

851
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,670
Because he didn't look like them.

852
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:52,872
Maybe it was his color.
They attacked him!

853
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:56,312
So he came back to us.

854
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:02,074
Two days later, we tried again.

855
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:05,273
This time it worked
and he flew away.

856
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:09,120
Then, and this is truly wonderful,

857
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:14,231
one day, after about a month,
maybe 20 days,

858
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:18,639
he came back,
accompanied by another pigeon.

859
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:22,111
He had married! And he came back

860
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:25,432
and landed
just above Marzouki's cell

861
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:29,719
where he sat cooing with his lady love.

862
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:32,509
We were so happy.
"Ah, he's married,

863
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:34,990
he's come to bid us farewell."

864
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:38,270
Some even cried.

865
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:43,157
It was really moving,
that little pigeon...

866
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:03,235
Before we parted,
as he was driving me back,

867
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:05,990
he suddenly said to me,
at a crossroad:

868
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:10,071
"You know, I feel as if
everything here,

869
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:13,790
this street, that man,
those trees,

870
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:17,038
you and me... that all this
is just a dream

871
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:20,710
and I will soon wake up
in Tazmamart.

872
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:25,870
All he had told me
about hell was so present within me

873
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:29,909
that for a brief moment,
I felt I was part of his dream.

874
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:35,790
Then he added:
"When I got back my freedom,

875
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:40,557
for weeks and months
I had this awful feeling:

876
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:44,836
'All this isn't real,
I'm still dreaming,

877
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,840
I'll soon wake up in Tazmamart.'

878
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:02,197
Surviving.

879
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:06,193
Surviving so that words never die.

880
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,273
We had to survive,

881
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:13,350
to speak for those who were buried
along the walls of Tazmamart.

882
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:20,279
At least one of us must survive
the savagery, lest memory forget.

883
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:23,349
Lest History forget.

884
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:26,115
Lest stone forget.

885
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,154
Lest blood forge

886
01:43:02,360 --> 01:43:05,512
One day, a man, a filmmaker,

887
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,316
has a dream.

888
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:14,434
It is the dream of a little boy
who was told the story of Ulysses,

889
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:18,759
the man who lived happily
with his family, then left one day.

890
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:24,911
It's the story of a man
who went to Africa

891
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,117
to film men and spirits,

892
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:30,711
whose soul became
the guardian of the river.

893
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:35,476
It's the story of a man who dreamed
of finding the Garden of Eden,

894
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,717
that fabulous place
from mythical times

895
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:40,753
where men and animals
lived in the same world.

896
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:46,638
It's the story of a man,
an unknown slave,

897
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:51,397
who, without realizing it,
was the first to go around the world.

898
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:56,273
It's the story of a man,
unjustly imprisoned,

899
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,120
who waited like a beast
for 18 years

900
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:01,880
before he saw the blue sky
once more.

901
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:07,791
It's the story of a man
who sailed around the world

902
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:10,316
and who sent his filmmaker friend

903
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,636
images from all over the world.

904
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:08,437
I remember this man.

905
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:14,439
At his home, I saw this photo:

906
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:19,109
a young woman and a sequoia.

907
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:27,837
Then he took me into his garden

908
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:32,318
and showed me the sequoia
he'd brought back from Canada:

909
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:34,599
a baby.

910
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:42,629
And for the first time,
I saw a man taller than a sequoia.

911
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:57,433
The Japanese say a garden
is the portrait of a soul.

912
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:06,313
Since then, Andre has left us

913
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:09,400
and the sequoia continues to grow.

914
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:29,919
Stany continues his sea journey.

915
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:34,472
I hope all is well with you,
my journey continues...

916
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:37,393
He reaches Hiva-Oa,
in the Marquesas Islands.

917
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:40,160
I don't know how to describe it.
It's splendid, magnificent.

918
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:42,272
I'm in paradise.

919
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:46,189
I'm sending you my latest images.
I hope they'll be useful for your film.

920
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,916
As for me,
I'm heading for new horizons.

921
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:57,677
He sends me these images for my film
about the final days of Gauguin,

922
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:01,240
the painter who went
to live in paradise,

923
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:03,916
the painter who
worked on dreams.

924
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:11,112
For my part,
I'm doing portraits of young women

925
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:13,311
that Gauguin might have painted.

926
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:53,358
It was on Hiva-Oa that Gauguin
spent the final years of his life.

927
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:58,155
It has been 8 years since
he left Europe,

928
01:47:58,360 --> 01:48:02,354
where his reputation as
"island painter" is now established.

929
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:06,474
But Gauguin begins to feel lonely.

930
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:08,637
He is tired and ill

931
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:10,831
and can think of only one thing:

932
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:13,833
returning to France,
leaving this paradise

933
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:16,077
that has become a hell.

934
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:19,516
He writes to his friends back home

935
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:22,639
but they all advise him
not to come home.

936
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:26,038
One of them writes:

937
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:29,039
"You are now a great artist,

938
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:30,429
a legend,

939
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:34,913
who, from the depths of Oceania,
sends back unparalleled works

940
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:38,869
by a great man who has,
so to speak, disappeared from the world.

941
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,909
You must not come back."

942
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:47,353
But Gauguin insists. He even proposes
to come back to Europe and hide.

943
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:50,349
Perhaps he could live in Barcelona

944
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:53,836
and send his paintings to France
from there.

945
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:58,354
He is told he will be found out
and ridiculed.

946
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:07,272
So, prisoner to the dreams
of others, he stays

947
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:10,393
as his health gradually deteriorates.

948
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:13,680
When he died,

949
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:17,111
his final painting was found,

950
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:20,153
a Brittany village under the snow.

951
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:25,433
A few days later, the painting
was sold in an auction,

952
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:28,360
upside down, with the title:

953
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:31,399
View of Niagara Falls.

954
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:13,390
My daughter Lola, in India,

955
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:16,157
at the time of our great journeys.

956
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:54,118
She could play the beautiful Draupadi
in the film I want to make.

957
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:02,351
I dream of making a film
telling the Mahabharata,

958
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:05,194
the whole story of the Mahabharata,

959
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:08,273
the longest story ever written.

960
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:17,359
The Mahabharata is a story
told by a hermit to a child

961
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:21,639
when they meet in the
mythical world of Ancient India.

962
01:52:22,680 --> 01:52:24,591
As the elephant Ganesh was there,

963
01:52:24,760 --> 01:52:27,878
he broke off one of his tusks
and wrote the story,

964
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:30,669
that's how we know it.

965
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:35,472
Here, I show only
the beginning and the end,

966
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:39,156
and you must imagine
everything that happens in between.

967
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:46,196
In the beginning, there's a face-off
between Yudhishtira,

968
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:49,637
eldest of the five Pandavas brothers,
the goodies,

969
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:53,670
and Shakuni, uncle of
the hundred bad Kauravas,

970
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:56,434
who want to conquer
the universe.

971
01:52:57,640 --> 01:52:59,597
Yudhishtira has but one fault,

972
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:03,316
he likes to gamble and he's
about to bet his family

973
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:05,318
his wife, his brothers,

974
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:07,915
his palace and the whole universe.

975
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:10,677
Shakuni, sitting opposite,

976
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:14,237
is a professional cheat.

977
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:18,833
This all takes place
under the eyes of the beautiful Draupadi,

978
01:53:19,080 --> 01:53:24,393
Yudhishtira's wife, perhaps
the main stake of the game.

979
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:32,796
Let's play!
But promise you won't cheat.

980
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:36,480
Not cheat?

981
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:40,193
You ask a professional gambler,
not to cheat?

982
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:45,678
Would you ask the most beautiful woman
to make herself ugly

983
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:50,557
so as not to hurt others' feelings?

984
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:57,319
Would you silence an intelligent man
so as not to offend the idiots?

985
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:01,073
Yudhishtira, life isn't like that.

986
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:06,109
Then let's play!

987
01:54:12,200 --> 01:54:15,318
Thus began the epic tale
of the Mahabharata,

988
01:54:15,480 --> 01:54:19,155
the terrible war during which
Yudhishtira and his brothers

989
01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:21,636
had to win back the universe.

990
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:28,795
And this is the end.
Only Yudhishtira remains,

991
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:32,437
and he climbs the Himalayas
to get to heaven.

992
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:35,798
But it is so cold

993
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:40,637
that he would have died
if a dog had not come and warmed him up.

994
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:52,029
Have I arrived?
- Yes, Yudhishtira.

995
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:56,198
You have arrived at last.

996
01:54:57,720 --> 01:55:00,519
You have finally reached
the gates of heaven.

997
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:04,754
Your mother, your brothers,

998
01:55:05,960 --> 01:55:09,237
your wife, Drapaudi,
are all waiting for you.

999
01:55:09,680 --> 01:55:12,593
Come, Yudhishtira, follow me.

1000
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:18,793
No, Yudhishtira,
you may enter paradise,

1001
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:24,069
but not the dog.
- If the dog doesn't come, neither do I!

1002
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:32,509
Here you are at last

1003
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:35,999
You, for whom I have been waiting

1004
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:38,870
So long

1005
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:42,673
Jewel of my heart

1006
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:50,313
The doors of heaven are open

1007
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:52,637
They are the doors of happiness

1008
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:56,439
The doors of heaven are open

1009
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:59,713
They are the doors of happiness

1010
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:03,158
For eternal happiness awaits us

1011
01:56:06,040 --> 01:56:07,872
Come, my love

1012
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:11,317
Come, my love

1013
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:14,431
Come, my love

1014
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:17,517
Come, my love

1015
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:22,392
In heaven the river
of endless happiness flows

1016
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:25,433
Leave the dog
and come join us, my love

1017
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:28,838
Come, my love Come, my love

1018
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:35,073
Leave him

1019
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:38,198
Leave him

1020
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:41,319
Leave him

1021
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:13,232
You will see
what happens to the dog

1022
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:16,392
and everything that happens
between the beginning and the end

1023
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:19,877
the day the film is finished.

1024
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:12,314
I dream of filming
a romantic epic,

1025
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:16,189
a tragic love story
like that of John Nicol.

1026
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:20,798
Here is the story.

1027
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:24,270
In July 1789,

1028
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:27,433
a ship of the royal fleet
leaves the port of London

1029
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:32,276
carrying 245 women
and bound for Australia.

1030
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:36,120
Cook has just
discovered the continent

1031
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:38,914
and the fleshly needs
of the settlers must be met

1032
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:41,596
and the new colony populated.

1033
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:45,389
Mainly thieves and prostitutes,

1034
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:49,873
the government had taken them out of prison
to deport them to Australia.

1035
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:54,756
Among them
is a young girl of 18,

1036
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:57,031
Sarah Whitelam.

1037
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:02,076
The crew, led by
His Majesty's officers,

1038
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:04,636
counts all sorts of sailors

1039
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:09,232
including a 34-year old Scotsman,
John Nicol.

1040
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:14,990
They hug the coast of Africa
and cross the Indian Ocean

1041
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:18,198
on a voyage
that will last 10 months.

1042
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:26,199
John Nicol falls madly in love
with Sarah Whitelam,

1043
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:30,469
and their love
grows stronger over the journey.

1044
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:35,429
Sarah is one of the 50 women
to give birth

1045
01:59:35,640 --> 01:59:37,631
during the voyage.

1046
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:49,149
On arriving in Australia,
John Nicol has to leave Sarah

1047
01:59:49,560 --> 01:59:53,633
and return to England,
according to the terms of his contract.

1048
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:59,197
He swears he will return
as soon as he can, and sails away.

1049
02:00:02,640 --> 02:00:05,393
Years pass before he returns.

1050
02:00:05,640 --> 02:00:09,793
But when he does, Sarah
is no longer there.

1051
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:12,113
He makes enquiries

1052
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:15,915
and discovers she has left
on a ship heading for Bombay.

1053
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:20,151
What no one dares tell him,
and what he would never find out,

1054
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:24,309
is that she is married
to a settler,

1055
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:25,879
mother of two children.

1056
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:33,110
John Nicol leaves for Bombay
and searches everywhere for her.

1057
02:00:33,800 --> 02:00:37,430
He searches in the countryside,
he searches in the city,

1058
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:39,836
but finds her nowhere.

1059
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:43,633
He looks for her all over,
but finds nothing.

1060
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:49,918
So he leaves and travels
to all the ports in the world.

1061
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:53,678
Cape Town, Buenos Aires,

1062
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:57,318
London, Rio de Janeiro,

1063
02:00:57,880 --> 02:01:01,236
Santa Cruz, Batavia,

1064
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:04,234
Zanzibar, Bombay,

1065
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:06,909
Sidney, Canton,

1066
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:09,800
Macau, Tangier,

1067
02:01:10,280 --> 02:01:12,635
Lisbon, Recife,

1068
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:15,878
Salvador de Bahia, Havana,

1069
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:19,352
Valparaiso, Bilbao
and Port-Louis,

1070
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:21,995
La Rochelle and Porto Ribeira...

1071
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:26,229
For over 25 years,
John Nicol travelled the world

1072
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:28,630
going all the way round, twice.

1073
02:01:29,120 --> 02:01:32,750
He landed on six continents,
fought with pirates

1074
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:34,758
and Napoleon's fleet,

1075
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:39,352
made friends in China,
Jamaica and Hawaii.

1076
02:01:39,880 --> 02:01:43,236
But he never found Sarah Whitelam.

1077
02:01:53,080 --> 02:01:57,631
At the beginning of the 19th century,
exhausted, he returned home,

1078
02:01:57,840 --> 02:01:59,478
to Scotland.

1079
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:10,398
He wrote: "By then I was too old
to look for her further,

1080
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:13,673
and I didn't know
where in the world she was,

1081
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:17,231
or even if she was still alive."

1082
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:21,352
For in 1822,

1083
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:24,751
a publisher in Edinburgh
asked to publish his memoirs.

1084
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:30,595
Having no money to live on,
John Nicol accepted.

1085
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:34,550
But he was old now,
and had forgotten the dates

1086
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:36,631
and places of his journeys.

1087
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:40,191
All he now remembered

1088
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:43,074
was the name of the woman
he had loved all his life,

1089
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:46,350
Sarah Whitelam.

1090
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:34,591
Victor Hugo used to come here.

1091
02:03:37,040 --> 02:03:39,759
It's one of the places
where he liked to write.

1092
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:46,434
But when you go back
over the writer's path,

1093
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:50,275
it becomes clear that the dates
and places of his manuscripts

1094
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:53,393
do not always correspond
to reality.

1095
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:58,120
Many of his texts
served him as an alibi

1096
02:03:58,400 --> 02:03:59,993
to be elsewhere,

1097
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:03,670
a place where he met
his love dreams.

1098
02:04:06,160 --> 02:04:10,757
One of these loves,
the strongest, was Juliette Drouet.

1099
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:14,676
A young orphan,
fresh from the convent,

1100
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:18,271
and turned actress.
She met Victor Hugo

1101
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:20,073
and they became lovers.

1102
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:22,757
She left everything for him,

1103
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:26,272
following him like a shadow
for 50 years.

1104
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:32,756
Over the years, she wrote him
over 20,000 love letters.

1105
02:05:44,480 --> 02:05:46,994
There are so many images,
everywhere.

1106
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:51,435
So many images of the other,
the elsewhere,

1107
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:55,196
that you think:
"Why go out anymore,

1108
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:58,638
out there, into the landscapes,

1109
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:01,872
the horizons we've already seen,
already shown?"

1110
02:06:04,240 --> 02:06:07,392
Might as well stay home,
with oneself

1111
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:10,234
and imagine the other,
the elsewhere,

1112
02:06:10,680 --> 02:06:13,069
and tell stories.

1113
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:16,390
For though there are
too many images,

1114
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:19,470
points of view are lacking,

1115
02:06:19,680 --> 02:06:22,274
and there are still
stories to be told.

1116
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:09,078
I'd like to film the story,
or rather the journey, of Lobera,

1117
02:07:09,800 --> 02:07:13,077
a Spanish aristocrat
from the 13th century.

1118
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:20,630
He vowed to go to Jerusalem
with the fourth crusade.

1119
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:24,433
But, after much thought,

1120
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:28,270
the length of the journey
and his fear of the Saracens

1121
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:30,437
made him change his mind.

1122
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:34,070
He then undertook,
on his estate,

1123
02:07:34,360 --> 02:07:36,874
a long imaginary journey.

1124
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:40,671
For over a year,
he toured his estate

1125
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:44,437
four times a day
until he had covered

1126
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:49,111
the same distance as that
between his castle and Jerusalem.

1127
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:54,475
In the 18th century,

1128
02:08:54,680 --> 02:08:57,991
Bougainville also leaves
on a trip around the world.

1129
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:03,313
A certain Commerson is chosen
as naturalist for the expedition

1130
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:07,111
and boards ship with his
young domestic, Jean Baret,

1131
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:11,559
who is in fact his servant
and mistress, Jeanne Baret.

1132
02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:16,035
Women are not allowed on board
His Majesty's ships

1133
02:09:16,480 --> 02:09:18,437
and Jeanne is disguised as a man.

1134
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:24,153
She manages to fool the crew
for over a year.

1135
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:28,834
They reach the coasts of Brazil,

1136
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:33,752
hug the coast of South America
and enter the Pacific Ocean.

1137
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:41,271
They arrive in Polynesia and
Bougainville is in seventh heaven.

1138
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:47,430
But as they disembark,
the naked natives

1139
02:09:47,640 --> 02:09:51,315
<i>rush towards Jeanne Bare!
Shouting: “ A woman, a woman!“</i>

1140
02:09:51,480 --> 02:09:53,630
and start to undress her.

1141
02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:00,157
Unmasked,
Bougainville questions her

1142
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:02,829
and she lies to protect her lover,

1143
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:05,919
saying that Commerson
is aware of nothing.

1144
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:11,120
Generously, Bougainville

1145
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:13,999
drops them off on Mauritius
on the home journey

1146
02:10:14,240 --> 02:10:16,390
to avoid them being punished.

1147
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:19,358
Commerson lived another 5 years,

1148
02:10:19,480 --> 02:10:22,393
before falling ill and dying,

1149
02:10:22,600 --> 02:10:26,195
but not before he named a flower
after his young mistress:

1150
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:28,471
the Baretia.

1151
02:10:30,440 --> 02:10:33,876
Later, Jeanne married
a French soldier

1152
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:38,910
and returned to Europe with him,
thus ending her trip around the world.

1153
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:50,155
Of Jeanne Baret, the first woman
to sail around the world,

1154
02:10:50,440 --> 02:10:52,716
there is not a single image.

1155
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:56,997
Unless it be
the image of a flower.

1156
02:11:11,080 --> 02:11:14,710
Today, the immensity of space
leads to other journeys,

1157
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:16,473
ever further.

1158
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:21,354
And we look at the universe
like the frogs watch the cabin,

1159
02:11:21,680 --> 02:11:24,115
with the same curiosity.

1160
02:11:27,440 --> 02:11:29,078
And we send out signals.

1161
02:11:30,640 --> 02:11:32,517
The space probe Voyager

1162
02:11:32,800 --> 02:11:35,758
has long since left our galaxy.

1163
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:40,353
It will outlast the solar system
and all life on earth.

1164
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:45,871
It carries sounds, voices,
music from our planet.

1165
02:12:34,040 --> 02:12:37,476
Worlds appear and disappear...

1166
02:12:39,640 --> 02:12:42,792
This is the last moment
of the Ubykh language.

1167
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:50,833
This man from Anatolia is dead
and with him died the Ubykh language,

1168
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:52,912
which he was the last to speak.

1169
02:12:56,240 --> 02:13:01,155
The last sounds of this strange language
were a set of lies.

1170
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:06,277
"For," he said, "There are no words
without lies."

1171
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:28,038
The police have just arrested
a cinema student

1172
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:30,919
who was prostituting herself
to pay for her studies.

1173
02:13:31,960 --> 02:13:34,918
Under the streetlamp,
she was reading Kant.

1174
02:13:37,040 --> 02:13:39,998
She told them
the parable of the pigeon.

1175
02:13:42,280 --> 02:13:47,116
"When the pigeon flies, it struggles
against the resistance of the air,

1176
02:13:47,320 --> 02:13:50,790
and imagines it would be easier
to fly in empty space.

1177
02:13:51,200 --> 02:13:54,192
But if it flew in empty space,
it would fall.

1178
02:13:58,520 --> 02:14:02,195
In order not to fall,
one must learn to resist,"

1179
02:14:02,480 --> 02:14:04,357
she told them.

1180
02:14:40,040 --> 02:14:43,670
It would be the tale of
a young filmmaker, just starting out.

1181
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:50,519
He wants to film rebellion,
resistance,

1182
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:52,990
rejection of the world
the way it is.

1183
02:14:55,120 --> 02:14:57,873
First, he writes a script

1184
02:14:58,120 --> 02:15:00,191
and gets together a big team.

1185
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:03,634
There's music
and professional actors.

1186
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:06,272
Ready? Action!

1187
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:12,430
It could be the tale
of this young woman, in England,

1188
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:14,278
in the fifties.

1189
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:16,919
Maybe she's a spy.

1190
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:23,639
She could be a Russian spy,
supporting the revolutionary cause.

1191
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:29,709
Or an Indian terrorist, fighting
for her country's independence.

1192
02:15:48,680 --> 02:15:52,469
But something's wrong,
it's all too heavy.

1193
02:15:53,600 --> 02:15:57,912
So he writes a simpler fiction
and films it near home.

1194
02:16:00,760 --> 02:16:02,433
The actress is the same,

1195
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:05,918
now a Maoist militant
in the sixties,

1196
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:10,671
but the mother and father
are not professional actors.

1197
02:16:17,080 --> 02:16:20,072
Careful, silence,

1198
02:16:21,240 --> 02:16:22,833
we're filming.

1199
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:26,075
But something's wrong,

1200
02:16:28,200 --> 02:16:31,238
because reality doesn't follow
his script.

1201
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:41,639
So, he stops writing

1202
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:45,710
and plunges his actress into
the social fringe of the eighties.

1203
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:50,039
OK for the sound.

1204
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:03,110
But something is still wrong,

1205
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:06,434
is not synchronous with reality.

1206
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:13,876
So he drops the whole team

1207
02:17:14,840 --> 02:17:19,152
and makes portraits of the rebels,
the marginals of his time.

1208
02:17:49,440 --> 02:17:52,558
But he still feels
that something is wrong.

1209
02:17:52,800 --> 02:17:55,189
He feels the gap
between them and him,

1210
02:17:55,520 --> 02:17:58,160
and realizes it's just an image.

1211
02:18:00,400 --> 02:18:02,357
So, he sets off alone

1212
02:18:02,600 --> 02:18:06,912
realizing he must stop expressing
his rebellion through others' eyes.

1213
02:18:12,040 --> 02:18:14,395
He starts to film the world:

1214
02:18:15,200 --> 02:18:16,315
water,

1215
02:18:16,680 --> 02:18:18,398
stones,

1216
02:18:18,720 --> 02:18:20,711
clouds.

1217
02:18:24,440 --> 02:18:28,195
Yes, that's how it could end:

1218
02:18:28,840 --> 02:18:31,992
he films the clouds,
over and over...

1219
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:39,436
Then he understands
that he simply has to watch them,

1220
02:18:41,440 --> 02:18:44,796
that he must stop
wanting to reproduce the world...

1221
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:14,192
Is this OK?
- Yes, that's fine.

1222
02:21:16,480 --> 02:21:18,710
Look at me.

1223
02:22:12,800 --> 02:22:14,791
I'd like to film all the places

1224
02:22:15,080 --> 02:22:18,630
all the things in the world
called "I don't know'

1225
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:21,476
or "I don't understand"

1226
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:24,155
because of the surprising encounters

1227
02:22:24,360 --> 02:22:26,749
between travellers and natives.

1228
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:31,676
When Captain Cook
arrived in Australia,

1229
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:35,675
he pointed to an animal
and asked what it was called.

1230
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:40,473
The aborigine answered:
"I don't understand":

1231
02:22:41,240 --> 02:22:43,231
kangourou.

1232
02:22:44,040 --> 02:22:49,114
Cook actually died due to
a misunderstanding in Hawaii.

1233
02:22:49,520 --> 02:22:52,273
The natives, thinking he was a god,

1234
02:22:52,480 --> 02:22:55,359
ate him and
were awaiting his return.

1235
02:22:56,920 --> 02:23:01,073
When Cook's companions
explained that he was human,

1236
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:04,636
that he was now dead
and would not return,

1237
02:23:05,240 --> 02:23:07,117
the natives apologized

1238
02:23:07,400 --> 02:23:11,030
and gave back the bits
they had not eaten.

1239
02:23:19,880 --> 02:23:24,829
My story box
is a reservoir of dream films.

1240
02:23:25,160 --> 02:23:28,437
An Italian woman
in a hospital in Lugo, Italy,

1241
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:32,036
who fell into
a deep coma six months ago,

1242
02:23:32,200 --> 02:23:34,874
a few weeks
after falling pregnant,

1243
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:38,033
shed a tear on Thursday
as she gave birth to her baby.

1244
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:42,114
All these amazing stories
come from everyday life.

1245
02:23:42,760 --> 02:23:45,229
Like the one
of the old Polish lady

1246
02:23:45,440 --> 02:23:47,590
whose portrait I'd like to do.

1247
02:23:49,600 --> 02:23:51,557
She's 113 years old.

1248
02:23:52,680 --> 02:23:57,072
When asked what it was like
to be so old

1249
02:23:57,480 --> 02:24:01,155
she said she was afraid
she might never die.

1250
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:20,910
So I raise my glass
to those who are dead, the ancestors,

1251
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:25,119
to you, Jean Rouch, who I often saw
make this gesture of offering,

1252
02:24:25,320 --> 02:24:27,391
a salute to the ancestors.

1253
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:37,313
To you, who watched
the dancing Dogon masks

1254
02:24:37,480 --> 02:24:39,596
that you brought over to Paris,

1255
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:43,793
the masks from
the cliffs of Bandiagara

1256
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:47,112
that Germaine Dieterlen
had taught you about.

1257
02:25:59,600 --> 02:26:04,071
Hail to the ancestors, to those
who are drunk with adventure,

1258
02:26:04,440 --> 02:26:07,592
to those for whom drunkenness
represents the disorder

1259
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:09,751
at the origin of the world,

1260
02:26:09,960 --> 02:26:14,272
for the souls of the dead are thirsty,
as you used to say, Jean.

1261
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:27,231
Rouch, who filmed the Dogons
for years,

1262
02:26:27,480 --> 02:26:31,075
often spoke to me of the
Bandiagara cliffs where they live.

1263
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:35,437
He spoke of it as
a mythical, magical place,

1264
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:38,752
an apparition
in a Chirico landscape.

1265
02:26:40,320 --> 02:26:43,153
But since Rouch,
so many others have been there,

1266
02:26:43,480 --> 02:26:46,518
so many other images
of these cliffs have been made,

1267
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:49,150
that I wanted to dream my own.

1268
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:11,193
There was...

1269
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:13,831
There was a dream...

1270
02:29:15,080 --> 02:29:17,879
There was the dream
of a film with Jan.

1271
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:22,478
Jan was a mechanic
and a musician.

1272
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:27,999
I remember filming him
one evening.

1273
02:29:28,640 --> 02:29:31,837
My name is Jan
and I like mechanics.

1274
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:41,434
Could you move closer to the light?
- Yes.

1275
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:45,036
Could you move your face
closer to the light. OK.

1276
02:29:49,880 --> 02:29:53,475
The film never got made
because Jan left for Africa,

1277
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:55,000
to do aid work.

1278
02:29:57,280 --> 02:30:00,113
Months later, I received
a letter from him,

1279
02:30:00,560 --> 02:30:03,598
on December 6th,
a letter from Africa,

1280
02:30:04,480 --> 02:30:06,756
on Saint Nicolas Day.

1281
02:30:09,320 --> 02:30:13,439
I read Jan's words
and watched what I had just filmed.

1282
02:30:14,040 --> 02:30:15,838
I got lost between
here and there,

1283
02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:20,192
between my images
and what I was reading.

1284
02:30:22,480 --> 02:30:27,475
Jan wrote about their inability
to contain a starving crowd.

1285
02:30:28,320 --> 02:30:31,551
He described the disorder,
the pushing,

1286
02:30:31,720 --> 02:30:36,157
the crush to grab some food,
to survive.

1287
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:41,873
Then he said that he
and the others on the mission

1288
02:30:42,120 --> 02:30:45,192
went back to their camp,
shocked at what they had seen.

1289
02:30:45,960 --> 02:30:50,511
Then he, like the others,
broke down and cried.

1290
02:30:53,720 --> 02:30:57,554
He wrote: "A

 the men
break down and cry.

1291
02:30:58,080 --> 02:31:01,311
But the women hold up."

1292
02:31:02,240 --> 02:31:06,791
He told me how fascinated he was
by their resistance.

1293
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:40,672
Between the beginning and the end
of the Mahabharata,

1294
02:31:41,080 --> 02:31:43,117
right in the middle of the tale,

1295
02:31:43,400 --> 02:31:45,391
there is a pond,

1296
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:47,677
a magic pond,

1297
02:31:48,600 --> 02:31:52,195
and if Yudhishtira
wants to pass,

1298
02:31:52,480 --> 02:31:54,994
he must answer these questions:

1299
02:31:58,640 --> 02:32:01,154
What is swifter than the wind?

1300
02:32:03,480 --> 02:32:04,754
Thought.

1301
02:32:06,480 --> 02:32:08,835
Give me an example of sorrow.

1302
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:12,519
Ignorance.

1303
02:32:13,240 --> 02:32:15,595
An example of defeat.

1304
02:32:17,280 --> 02:32:18,998
Victory.

1305
02:32:20,440 --> 02:32:23,193
Which is the most cunning animal?

1306
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:28,431
The one man has not yet
managed to know.

1307
02:32:29,480 --> 02:32:31,756
What causes the world?

1308
02:32:32,960 --> 02:32:34,473
Love.

1309
02:32:35,160 --> 02:32:37,117
What is your opposite?

1310
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:40,199
Myself.

1311
02:32:40,840 --> 02:32:45,311
What about rebellion?
Why do men rebel?

1312
02:32:48,080 --> 02:32:52,756
To find beauty,
in life, or in death.

1313
02:32:54,480 --> 02:32:58,155
What is inevitable for all of us?

1314
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:02,997
Happiness.

1315
02:33:04,040 --> 02:33:06,395
Happiness is inevitable.

1316
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:12,237
Now tell me,
what is the greatest marvel?

1317
02:33:13,880 --> 02:33:15,996
The greatest marvel

1318
02:33:16,520 --> 02:33:19,160
is that each day, death strikes
all around us

1319
02:33:19,480 --> 02:33:22,233
yet we live as if we were immortal.

1320
02:33:22,960 --> 02:33:25,554
That is the greatest marvel.

1321
02:34:45,200 --> 02:34:48,670
There's a film to be made
about Bernard Moitessier.

1322
02:34:51,440 --> 02:34:55,399
In 1968,
the Golden Globe was organized,

1323
02:34:55,520 --> 02:34:59,991
the first round-the-world race,
solo and without stopovers.

1324
02:35:01,480 --> 02:35:04,552
Moitessier was one of nine
to take up the challenge.

1325
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:09,230
He left on his yacht
with no help,

1326
02:35:09,480 --> 02:35:13,519
no radio equipment,
taking only a little tape recorder.

1327
02:35:19,520 --> 02:35:22,797
After ten months of sailing,
he was in the lead

1328
02:35:23,120 --> 02:35:26,590
and was preparing to sail up
the Atlantic towards England

1329
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:30,111
where the Golden Globe
awaited him,

1330
02:35:30,480 --> 02:35:33,518
along with a reward
of 5000 sterling pounds

1331
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:36,718
and, naturally, fame.

1332
02:35:37,200 --> 02:35:39,396
He would be the first sailor ever

1333
02:35:39,640 --> 02:35:43,395
to sail single-handed
around the world

1334
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:45,637
without stopovers.

1335
02:35:47,560 --> 02:35:49,039
But, on April 18th,

1336
02:35:49,240 --> 02:35:53,757
he catapulted a message
onto the deck of a passing ship:

1337
02:35:54,520 --> 02:35:57,558
"I am sailing on
to the Pacific Islands,

1338
02:35:57,800 --> 02:35:59,598
because I am happy at sea,

1339
02:35:59,840 --> 02:36:02,878
and perhaps also,
to save my soul."

1340
02:36:04,320 --> 02:36:08,473
Turning his back on glory,
he sailed on to Polynesia.

1341
02:36:09,320 --> 02:36:10,879
I am truly happy at sea.

1342
02:36:11,120 --> 02:36:14,590
You can't imagine how good
I feel, alone, peaceful.

1343
02:36:15,800 --> 02:36:19,794
It's not always easy,
but when things go well, it's...

1344
02:36:21,240 --> 02:36:24,073
It's fantastic,
all the things I have felt.

1345
02:36:24,480 --> 02:36:26,790
It's something that...

1346
02:36:26,960 --> 02:36:31,716
So I don't want to stop now.
It would be stupid to return to Europe.

1347
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:34,275
I was always on the go there.

1348
02:36:34,480 --> 02:36:37,393
I could never live a whole month

1349
02:36:37,520 --> 02:36:40,717
- what I call living -
really living...

1350
02:36:40,960 --> 02:36:42,712
Letting the sun inside you,

1351
02:36:42,920 --> 02:36:46,197
finding a deep sense of peace.

1352
02:36:46,360 --> 02:36:49,716
I never found that in France,
I never did,

1353
02:36:50,400 --> 02:36:51,799
not for a whole month.

1354
02:36:51,960 --> 02:36:55,078
There were small joys,
snatched from time to time.

1355
02:36:57,640 --> 02:37:00,234
I cannot go back to France,

1356
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:02,757
truly, I cannot."

1357
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:12,473
Moitessier is the man who could
have equalled Achilles' glory,

1358
02:37:12,720 --> 02:37:17,078
but rejected it to become
Ulysses, the traveller.

1359
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:22,593
By his death before
the ramparts of Troy

1360
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:26,839
Achilles answered the question:
"Why die?"

1361
02:37:29,360 --> 02:37:32,432
But Ulysses,
who sailed the seas,

1362
02:37:32,680 --> 02:37:36,560
then returned to his family,
only to leave again,

1363
02:37:37,400 --> 02:37:41,553
was seeking the answer
to the question:

1364
02:37:42,320 --> 02:37:44,357
"How to live?"

1365
02:38:32,720 --> 02:38:34,757
There's a film I dream of making

1366
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:38,874
but which I never will, because
I'll no longer be of this world.

1367
02:38:40,920 --> 02:38:43,514
One day, after 2060,

1368
02:38:43,880 --> 02:38:46,440
the world population
will stop growing

1369
02:38:46,600 --> 02:38:49,069
and start to decrease.

1370
02:38:50,360 --> 02:38:52,510
I would like to film
the headlines

1371
02:38:52,720 --> 02:38:56,395
announcing this unique news
in the history of humanity.

1372
02:38:56,880 --> 02:38:59,349
And I would like to film
the slow disruption

1373
02:38:59,800 --> 02:39:03,111
it would cause to man's relationship
with the world,

1374
02:39:03,880 --> 02:39:05,314
with animals,

1375
02:39:06,040 --> 02:39:07,474
with himself.

1376
02:39:40,280 --> 02:39:41,679
It's winter.

1377
02:39:43,240 --> 02:39:45,311
The dog is sleeping.

1378
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:51,432
Far from everything and everyone,
the film hibernates.

1379
02:39:52,680 --> 02:39:54,273
I listen to the radio

1380
02:39:56,520 --> 02:39:58,318
and I travel...

1381
02:43:43,080 --> 02:43:44,991
A moment of the world...

1382
02:43:46,160 --> 02:43:49,039
To sit alone at a terrace

1383
02:43:49,240 --> 02:43:51,436
and watch the world.

1384
02:44:12,960 --> 02:44:16,032
For years,
when I saw a pile of ashes,

1385
02:44:16,360 --> 02:44:19,557
I imagined lovers,
awaiting their beloved,

1386
02:44:19,880 --> 02:44:24,431
hour after hour, smoking
one cigarette after another.

1387
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:32,720
Then one day, sitting at a terrace,

1388
02:44:32,920 --> 02:44:36,470
I saw a car draw up
and a door open...

1389
02:44:45,360 --> 02:44:46,759
A moment of the world.

1390
02:44:47,160 --> 02:44:50,835
Yes, I'd like to film
a moment of the world.

1391
02:44:54,320 --> 02:44:56,596
I'd watch the young women pass,

1392
02:44:57,200 --> 02:45:00,670
and think of Baudelaire's poem,
To a Passerby.

1393
02:45:01,760 --> 02:45:05,310
Baudelaire is sitting there,
at the terrace of a cafe,

1394
02:45:06,120 --> 02:45:08,714
he is alone, drinking.

1395
02:45:10,480 --> 02:45:12,676
Suddenly a woman passes

1396
02:45:12,960 --> 02:45:16,237
and glances at him
for a brief moment.

1397
02:45:16,560 --> 02:45:19,791
In that instant, he knows
he'll never see her again,

1398
02:45:20,400 --> 02:45:24,359
that he knows nothing about her,
that she is disappearing into the void.

1399
02:45:25,680 --> 02:45:28,069
And his poem, addressed to her,

1400
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:33,071
ends with these words:
"Oh you, whom I would have loved,

1401
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:36,115
Oh you, who knew it."

1402
02:45:58,080 --> 02:46:01,277
I dream of filming the gaze
of the women who pass.

1403
02:46:03,080 --> 02:46:06,038
And I dream
of filming friendly faces.

1404
02:46:08,280 --> 02:46:11,352
And I dream of filming
the vastness of the cosmos

1405
02:46:11,480 --> 02:46:15,235
where, perhaps,
all the souls of the universe meet.

1406
02:46:18,120 --> 02:46:20,680
I dream of filming
the face of an old lady

1407
02:46:20,880 --> 02:46:23,759
and finding there
the infancy of the world.

1408
02:46:27,040 --> 02:46:30,271
And I dream of filming
the desire of children.

1409
02:46:33,280 --> 02:46:36,398
And I dream of filming
the desire of lovers.

1410
02:46:39,840 --> 02:46:42,753
And I dream of filming desire...

1411
02:47:16,520 --> 02:47:18,670
I dream that it's summer,

1412
02:47:19,480 --> 02:47:23,713
that I offer Jean-Marie
a small role in a dream film.

1413
02:47:26,160 --> 02:47:30,358
It would be the film of a man
who, all his life, had done but one thing:

1414
02:47:31,480 --> 02:47:33,357
portraits of his dog.

1415
02:48:14,240 --> 02:48:16,117
But some dream films

1416
02:48:16,440 --> 02:48:19,114
are impossible to make.

1417
02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:28,754
For years, the same photo appeared
in the obituaries of a daily paper.

1418
02:48:30,320 --> 02:48:35,474
Every 27th of September,
the photo of lmgard and the words:

1419
02:48:35,640 --> 02:48:40,635
1982 - 1989 Already <i>7</i> years
Always close to you, Uncle.

1420
02:48:42,960 --> 02:48:45,793
But some films
must be kept silent,

1421
02:48:47,360 --> 02:48:49,920
some films will never be made,

1422
02:48:52,440 --> 02:48:55,114
some films are impossible to make.

1423
02:49:00,920 --> 02:49:02,558
Jean-Marie fell,

1424
02:49:02,960 --> 02:49:05,076
then entered a coma...

1425
02:49:10,280 --> 02:49:13,636
His heart, as big as a house,

1426
02:49:14,080 --> 02:49:16,356
beat on for a long while.

1427
02:49:19,520 --> 02:49:21,431
Then he left.

1428
02:50:13,520 --> 02:50:15,431
Jean-Marie's story,

1429
02:50:16,200 --> 02:50:18,111
like Ulysses' story,

1430
02:50:18,400 --> 02:50:20,118
like all stories,

1431
02:50:20,480 --> 02:50:21,834
tells us:

1432
02:50:22,680 --> 02:50:24,830
we cannot live without dreams,

1433
02:50:25,400 --> 02:50:26,720
without lies,

1434
02:50:27,200 --> 02:50:29,237
without illusions.

1435
02:52:09,680 --> 02:52:15,358
A film by Eric Pauwels

1436
02:54:38,440 --> 02:54:41,671
Subtitling: Tongues Untied
