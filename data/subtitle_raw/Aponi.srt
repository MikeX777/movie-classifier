And I'm very protective of her.

534
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,989
I mean I never made a connection before
like this in my life.

535
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,152
I wanna ask her to marry me.

536

You've been married
before isn't that right?

What Aponi and I have, doesn't
come along that often in life.

I can't picture myself without her.

How does Aponi feel about this?
Have you spoken to her about this at all?

541
00:36:13,197 --> 00:36:16,382
Yeah we have and we both want
the same things in life and…

542
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:19,919
To have your blessing would
mean the world to me.

543
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,929
I trust you…

544
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:25,183
And I believe you love my granddaughter.

545
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,986
But you gotta make me a promise that
you will love and take care of her

to ask her to marry me.

564

You gotta be kidding me?
You wanna marry this chick?

Do you remember when I was little

603
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:36,950
You would teach me how to cook, the first
thing you taught me was how to me eggs…

604
00:41:37,044 --> 00:41:40,943
First you should crack them
you should always use a fork,

605
00:41:40,968 --> 00:41:45,068
cause if you use the side of the
pan the shell might get in.

You don't have to get up Grandma…

She was such a Joy and inspiration
in all of our lives.

614
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,294
And I remember once it must have been
early spring?

615
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:12,864
And we were walking to school and walking
through the park, that gnats were out

616
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:17,811
It was slightly humid, and something
just flew by me really quickly

617
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,663
and I asked Grammy what's that, she's says…

618
00:43:21,238 --> 00:43:24,891
She says… it's a Rhopalocera

619
00:43:25,027 --> 00:43:27,000
and I said, what's a Rhopalocera?

620
00:43:27,246 --> 00:43:29,907
She said it means Butterfly…

621
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:34,228
She said it was her favorite
because it reminded her of me.

622
00:43:34,587 --> 00:43:38,874
Because in Native American my name
means Butterfly.

623
00:43:39,058 --> 00:43:41,500
She told me you can learn
a lot from a butterfly,

624
00:43:41,525 --> 00:43:43,477
you can watch them
they're so graceful…

625

their beauty and ever changing ways
you should try to be like them.

626

As I got older I finally
realized what she meant.

627
00:43:55,491 --> 00:43:58,647
I mean first butterflies
don't live that long.

628
00:44:00,899 --> 00:44:08,899
Really it's the fact that in order to be
happy in life you've got to be graceful,

629

what life is gonna give you.
