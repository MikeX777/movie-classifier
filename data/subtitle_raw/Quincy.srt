1
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,612
Wow.

2
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,366
Can you even fathom
what's happening, like...?

3
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,452
You know what I'm saying?
This is so...

4
00:01:58,577 --> 00:01:59,703
fucking crazy.

5
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,581
Quincy Jones' house, man.

6
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,540
Believe it?

7
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,252
So much history in here.

8
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,966
Hey, baby. What a pleasure, man.

9
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,885
Thank you so much
for doing this.

10
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,888
It's <i>The Pharmacy</i> with Dr. Dre,
special edition.

11
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,223
- Yes, it is.
- 'Cause we have the legend of all legends.

12
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,310
Quincy Jones. The legendary Quincy Jones.

13
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,811
Man, y'all making me sound old.

14
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:29,983
- My ultimate mentor and inspiration.
- Don't even know how to drive.

15
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,777
That's all right.

16
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,187
You're the reason why
I decided to get into production.

17
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,114
- So proud of him, my man.
- Yeah, thank you.

18
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,884
- Thank you so much.
- No, I mean that, man.

19
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,534
So, I really wanted to know

20
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,663
what type of struggles you had
and what did you have to go through?

21
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,832
I wasn't born in Bel Air, man.
I'm from the South Side of Chicago, man.

22
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,336
In the '30s, man, during the Depression,
damn, you kidding?

23
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,797
We lost my mother when I was seven,

24
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,217
and my brother and I, we were, like,
we were street rats, you know?

25
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,095
I wanted to be a gangster till I was 11.

26
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,680
Wow.

27
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,848
- You want to be what you see.
- Right.

28
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,684
And that's all we ever saw.

29
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,477
You see that right there?

30
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,690
I went on the wrong street
and they took a switchblade

31
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,566
- and nailed my hand to a fence, man.
- What?

32
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,484
Seven years old.

33
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,902
- See this one here?
- Yeah.

34
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,362
That's an ice pick, man.

35
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:16,779
Wow.

36
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:20,826
To know where you came from makes it
easier for you to get where you're going.

37
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,620
And I learned a long time ago that

38
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:27,040
your music can never be more or less
than you are as a human being.

39
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,249
And that's very true.

40
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,837
Wow, I... You know what?
I'm sitting here, just,

41
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,339
really tripping the fuck out, man.
You are so...

42
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,967
You are so inspiring, man.

43
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,512
It's like... like, do you know
who you are, man?

44
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,180
It's Quincy Jones!

45
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,983
Mr. Quincy Jones.

46
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:36,193
The first thing is to be humble
with your creativity

47
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,403
and graceful with your success.

48
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:57,380
You can't live without water or music.
You can't live without it.

49
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,761
Between Ray Charles and Sinatra,
I learned how to live.

50
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,890
Sinatra wore it for 40 years himself
and then he left it to me

51
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,308
and I never take it off.

52
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,143
Quincy Jones!

53
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,147
What sign are you?

54
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,065
What sign are you?

55
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,274
What's your birth sign?

56
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,485
Pisces. It's the same, we're both crazy.

57
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,486
Gemini.

58
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,072
Oh, God. Miles Davis and Prince.

59
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,616
I've been in this business 70 years.

60
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,367
It's unbelievable.

61
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,080
Hey, baby.

62
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:34,084
I got six daughters and one son.
That's why I don't have any hair.

63
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,132
- What a great treat to see you here.
- You too, man.

64
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,385
- How you been, man?
- I've been good, man, yeah.

65
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,595
Great. We've been
doing concerts this year.

66
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,721
You're kickin' ass.

67
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,266
- Life's a motherfucker, isn't it, man?
- Oh, yeah.

68
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,561
Pressure's on. Quincy's here.

69
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,061
Help!

70
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,107
How are you, guys?

71
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,861
I can party all the time.
Never had a problem with that.

72
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,665
- What?
- I can't be like you, I cannot...

73
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,209
hang out all night and then...
No, I can't do that.

74
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,378
Don't try to do what he's done.

75
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,630
- Yeah.
- No, 'cause you'll get your ass killed.

76
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,093
We worked the balls
off a pool table.

77
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,889
- Right, honey?
- Yeah, Dad.

78
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,640
You must be so tired.

79
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,350
- Honey, I'm past tired.
- Oh, Dad.

80
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,477
I couldn't even stand up
for the second number.

81
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,897
They gave us some serious wine, honey.

82
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,420
I know, but six bottles?!
How you gonna get it back?

83
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,692
We're gonna drink it here.

84
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,115
- Are you shooting, honey?
- I am.

85
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,329
I'm just learning. I'm not great
with a camera, I'm just learning how.

86
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,833
- Cute shoes, Dad.
- Thank you, honey.

87
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,002
- Really cute.
- Pimp shoes.

88
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:05,383
Do you think it's easier
to be up late in LA, to work by yourself?

89
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,844
- Yeah, absolutely.
- 'Cause nobody's up, right?

90
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,179
Absolutely.

91
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,973
Well, nobody's up that late anyway,
so I always wrote at night.

92
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,267
- Right.
- The muses come out then, you know?

93
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,852
- Right.
- Everybody used to say,

94
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,938
"Keep your score paper and pen
right near you,

95
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,316
'cause if you're not up, God will take it
down the street to Mancini."

96
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,069
It's very true, honey.

97
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,487
Haven't been sleeping a lot.

98
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,257
- Been sleeping a lot, or haven't?
- I <i>haven't</i> been sleeping a lot, no.

99
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,076
Too much on my mind, you know.
It's hard to turn it off.

100
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,412
But let me ask you a question. Do you
think you could drink in moderation?

101
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,122
- Do you think you could...
- Yeah, I do.

102
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,249
Or do you think
it's a slippery slope, honestly?

103
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,961
No, no, no,
it's not a slippery slope at all. No.

104
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,546
But I want one badder than ever now.

105
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,424
- You want what?
- A drink.

106
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,518
Dino, get me a bourbon.

107
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,022
Where's Q?
Where's my... Where are ya?

108
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:02,774
Oh, yeah!

109
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,233
Come on!

110
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,609
Oh, yeah!

111
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,578
The seven of us all together.

112
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,705
We're all family.

113
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,749
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

114
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,549
- You know the palindromes?
- Mm-hmm.

115
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,968
Just found a good one.

116
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,763
"Go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog."

117
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,852
Go... hang... a salami.

118
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,770
I love those.

119
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,648
- These are amazing, did you try these?
- No.

120
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,445
I wonder what's wrong with my appetite
though. Something's wrong.

121
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,654
Really, Dad?

122
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,467
- 'Cause you know me, I can eat, honey.
- I know, I don't like that.

123
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,868
Yeah, but it's okay.

124
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,620
It's all right. It'll be all right, honey.

125
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,584
No... If you don't feel good,
you gotta take care of it.

126
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,377
I will, I will.

127
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,096
<i>My mother had gone away sick one day.</i>

128
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:03,394
<i>She kicked and screamed as they threw
a straitjacket on her and carried her out.</i>

129
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,273
<i>And just like that, she was gone.</i>

130
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,742
<i>Daddy was a carpenter for the Jones Boys,</i>

131
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,912
<i>the black gangsters
that ran the ghetto back in Chicago.</i>

132
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,376
<i>We fought, we stole,
we ran with gangs and from gangs.</i>

133
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,920
<i>By that time, I was carrying a knife</i>

134
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,714
<i>and doing whatever
I thought I had to do to survive.</i>

135
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,133
<i>Why not?</i>

136
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,968
<i>My world seemed to be senseless.</i>

137
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,595
<i>If my mother could go crazy,
who couldn't?</i>

138
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,807
<i>Daddy was in over his head</i>

139
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,226
<i>and took us to stay with his mother.</i>

140
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,479
<i>Grandma was a former slave.</i>

141
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,816
<i>She cooked whatever
she could get her hands on.</i>

142
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,570
<i>Mustard greens, okra, possums, and rats.</i>

143
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,991
<i>We ate them
because that's all there was to eat.</i>

144
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,579
<i>My mother broke out a couple of times,
and I remember, downstairs,</i>

145
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,622
<i>we heard the glass breaking,</i>

146
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,542
<i>and Daddy said,
"Sit down to the table and don't get up."</i>

147
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,960
<i>He said, "It's your mama."</i>

148
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,923
<i>Kids kept telling me,
"'Cause your mother's really messed up,</i>

149
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,676
<i>and if she gets out,
she's gonna kill you guys," you know?</i>

150
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:22,015
<i>And so I started to picture her
and associate her with a death threat.</i>

151
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,061
<i>When she got out one time, she came
and we saw her running to us.</i>

152
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,272
<i>We screamed
and we ran about seven blocks,</i>

153
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,940
<i>we were so afraid, you know?</i>

154
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,319
<i>I said, "I can't depend on a mother
'cause I don't have one,</i>

155
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,154
<i>so I don't need one," you know?</i>

156
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,365
<i>I was happy that Daddy said,</i>

157
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,284
<i>"We're leaving town, we're leaving now.</i>

158
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,786
<i>We're getting on a Trailway bus
and getting out of here."</i>

159
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,464
Do you know the year?

160
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,676
Do you know what year it is?

161
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,018
- What year?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

162
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,187
No.

163
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,775
Okay, it will come back. It will.

164
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,068
Okay.

165
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,071
Well, we had the new year,
so it's 2015.

166
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,030
I get it, yeah.

167
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,491
And the seventh
was when you got unconscious,

168
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,159
because it's now the eleventh.

169
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,996
So you lost four days out of your life.

170
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,793
Who is the president?

171
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,338
- What?
- Who's the president of the US?

172
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,422
What's his name?

173
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,092
Do you remember?

174
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,301
Sarah Palin.

175
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:47,100
I'm glad...
I'm glad some things haven't changed.

176
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,183
Oh.

177
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,606
You have any idea what happened to you?

178
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,690
No.

179
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,652
You were drinking too much.

180
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,949
And when you came in that night,
you were having trouble breathing,

181
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:07,161
your temperature was 103,
and your sugar was close to 1,000.

182
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,291
You have to be on a low-sugar diet.

183
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,544
Amazingly tough guy, huh?

184
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,504
- Yeah.
- That's for sure.

185
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,535
You guys are so supportive, baby.

186
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,164
I love them, so that's why
I got my shit together quick.

187
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,416
It was really scary.

188
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,961
I'm grateful to get that wake-up call.

189
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,503
You know, grateful.

190
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,467
After the operation,
in the hospital and everything,

191
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,635
my mind went to another place, honey.

192
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,014
And you reflect on things
you never thought about before.

193
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,097
Like what?

194
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:10,724
Vodka.

195
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,769
That ain't gonna be no more.

196
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:13,852
Nope.

197
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:16,938
Not going out.

198
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,024
Not yet.

199
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,986
When I go out, I'll be ready.

200
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,238
I'll be ready for it. Yeah.

201
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,036
- Happy birthday, Q.
- Thank you, man. Thanks for coming by.

202
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,372
- Love you.
- Love you too, honey.

203
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,625
- Love you, honey.
- Love you, Daddy.

204
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,708
Me, too.

205
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,670
Love you, Dad.

206
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,256
Smile, Dad. There you go, perfect.

207
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,679
That's a whole lot of love.

208
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:01,859
Yay!

209
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,070
Thank you guys so much.

210
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,324
I gotta tell you, I wish everybody here...

211
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,663
a long, long, long-ass life...

212
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,624
filled with a whole lot of, um...

213
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,460
tons of...

214
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,629
let's say...

215
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:24,799
love to share...

216
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:29,679
health to spare, and friends who care,
'cause that's really all that's important

217
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,973
when you get down to it,
to the bottom of it.

218
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,143
- I love you from the bottom of my heart.
- We love you!

219
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:37,145
Make a wish.

220
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,412
<i>Daddy found us a little house
in Washington state.</i>

221
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,708
<i>He grabbed the toolbox
and joined the long line of black folks</i>

222
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,294
<i>marching down the hill
to the naval shipyard.</i>

223
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:04,338
<i>He was a workaholic.</i>

224
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,342
<i>He tried to do everything he could
to make sure it worked, you know.</i>

225
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,556
<i>I was on shaky waters with identity
as a child anyway,</i>

226
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:17,143
<i>because, without Mama there,
you're not quite sure what's going down.</i>

227
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,771
<i>At the time, we're talking about the '40s,</i>

228
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,858
<i>in the school books,
black people didn't exist.</i>

229
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,652
<i>We didn't know who we wanted to be like.</i>

230
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,739
<i>There was nobody to see
that you wanted to be like, you know.</i>

231
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,576
<i>One night, I broke into the armory.</i>

232
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,330
<i>In the room,
there was an old upright piano.</i>

233
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,874
<i>I tinkled on it for a moment,</i>

234
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:44,212
<i>and I knew this was it for me, forever.</i>

235
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,466
<i>I was in heaven.</i>

236
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,677
<i>I took up percussion, trombone,</i>

237
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:55,264
<i>sousaphone, B-flat baritone horn,
French horn,</i>

238
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,683
<i>but I decided I wanted to play trumpet.</i>

239
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,685
<i>I couldn't get enough.</i>

240
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:07,360
<i>Just that idea, to see black men
that were dignified and proud.</i>

241
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,570
<i>I said, "That's what I want to be.</i>

242
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,407
<i>I want to be in that family,
I'd do anything to be in that family."</i>

243
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:17,286
<i>I used to hang backstage
with Count Basie and Clark Terry.</i>

244
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,121
<i>I know I used to bother them to death,</i>

245
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,500
<i>and they were kind enough to stop and say,
"Okay, here's how you do it."</i>

246
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,751
<i>And they helped me.</i>

247
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,004
<i>And I started to play in a band
when we were 14 years old</i>

248
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,631
<i>and worked in the nightclubs.</i>

249
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:33,177
<i>And after we finished, we used to go off
and jam all night playing bebop.</i>

250
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,890
<i>And that's where everybody
was talking about this guy named R.C.,</i>

251
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,559
<i>and he was 16 years old then.</i>

252
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:46,190
<i>I was new in town
and this 14-year-old cat comes up to me.</i>

253
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:51,487
<i>He said, "I'm Quincy Jones
and I play trumpet, and I want to write."</i>

254
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,864
<i>We hit it off right away.</i>

255
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,909
<i>Ray was so wise
when he was 16,</i>

256
00:17:56,993 --> 00:18:00,037
<i>and you know how it is,
when you have an older buddy</i>

257
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,790
<i>that seems to have all the answers
for everything.</i>

258
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,919
<i>He'd say, "Every music
has its own soul, Quincy.</i>

259
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,047
<i>It doesn't matter what style it is,
just be true to it."</i>

260
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,092
<i>He's truly like a brother to me.</i>

261
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,137
<i>In my mind, I sort of adopted him
like my brother.</i>

262
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,099
<i>By then,
I had seriously discovered girls.</i>

263
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,728
<i>I discovered the ladies
not in the same way I discovered music,</i>

264
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:27,732
<i>but enough to win the heart
of a beautiful girl named Jeri Caldwell</i>

265
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,025
<i>from my high school.</i>

266
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,988
<i>Night after night, as I wandered
in and out of clubs, bars, and juke joints</i>

267
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,825
<i>with my trumpet beneath my arm
and my scores tucked beneath my shirt,</i>

268
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:41,162
<i>a tiny glint of something new
began to emerge in my life.</i>

269
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,414
<i>Something I'd never had before.</i>

270
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,878
<i>I had no control over where I lived,
no control over my sick mother.</i>

271
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,880
<i>I couldn't control the angry whites</i>

272
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:54,383
<i>who still called me "nigger"
when they caught me alone on the street.</i>

273
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,762
<i>But music was one thing I could control.</i>

274
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,349
<i>It was the one thing
that offered me my freedom.</i>

275
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,396
<i>Lionel Hampton was like a god
in those days.</i>

276
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,149
<i>He had the rockin'- est band in America.</i>

277
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,444
<i>When he said, "Young huss,
you wanna join my band?"</i>

278
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,196
<i>I said, "Yes, sir!"</i>

279
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,281
<i>I was in the band!</i>

280
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:30,086
<i>Lionel Hampton would pass out
an itinerary of our schedule.</i>

281
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,838
<i>Seventy straight nights.</i>

282
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,216
<i>We worked non-stop, not one night off.</i>

283
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,056
<i>At that time, all of the black bands
had white bus drivers</i>

284
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,975
<i>to go in the restaurants to get the food
to bring it back to the band.</i>

285
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,603
<i>We hit some city in Texas,</i>

286
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,605
<i>and in the middle of the city,</i>

287
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,315
<i>there's this small church,</i>

288
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:55,695
<i>and there was a rope with a black dummy
hanging off of the steeple.</i>

289
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,364
<i>This was everyday stuff then.</i>

290
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,033
<i>You know you just better be careful.</i>

291
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,400
<i>And the best thing
that ever happened to me was traveling.</i>

292
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,168
<i>As soon as we got off the plane,
wherever it was, you know, Paris,</i>

293
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:14,255
<i>Turkey, Pakistan, Casablanca...</i>

294
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,591
<i>I made it my business
to get right into the lifestyle</i>

295
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,385
<i>of the real people in the country.</i>

296
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:29,770
Is there some vodka?

297
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,230
No, it's in there.

298
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,149
Why no... why no vodka?

299
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:39,739
Thank you, baby.

300
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,076
- So sweet.
- I'm nervous about Europe.

301
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,828
I don't... Forget it, honey.

302
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,080
- I don't even want wine.
- Really?

303
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,183
- Nothing wrong with that.
- You're not gonna want...

304
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,126
- It's not gonna be...
- No.

305
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,212
- I don't think so, I think he feels okay.
- It's been five, six months.

306
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,047
It's not even in my body anymore.

307
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,133
- Not even the temptation, honey.
- Good.

308
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,471
The girls are the only temptation.

309
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,638
Give it up for my brother, D'Angelo.

310
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,849
Mary J. Blige!

311
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,730
My brother, Carlos Santana!

312
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,285
- Boo!
- Hey, man, my baby.

313
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:09,995
- Hey, Herbie.
- Hey, Q.

314
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,456
- How you doin', man?
- Good. Missing you, man.

315
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,625
- You look great.
- I lost 50 pounds.

316
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,876
Congratulations, man!

317
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,504
- Thank you, sir, how...
- You started it.

318
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,464
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

319
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,260
<i>Merci.</i>

320
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,472
I just wanted to say first, tonight,

321
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,059
how much I appreciate
being a part of this family.

322
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,270
Very much so. Thank you.

323
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,858
These next two incredible human beings,

324
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,986
Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock!

325
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,445
<i>Mon frère.</i>

326
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,574
- Hey, Herbie.
- Hey.

327
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:49,952
- You got it?
- Got it.

328
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,245
All right. All right.

329
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,789
I'm really, really happy
how good you're looking, man.

330
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:54,707
Thank you, man.

331
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,459
Follow him. He told me a long time ago,
I didn't listen.

332
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,003
He told me to stop drinking.

333
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,922
- I worked on him for a while.
- He did! Ten years ago, man.

334
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,883
I said to Herbie, "You must be crazy."

335
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,968
Man, I've had less hair many times.

336
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,053
- Brain operations and shit.
- Oh, yeah.

337
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,097
- They're not getting you this time!
- Hell, no.

338
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,683
You got a new "get out of jail free" card.

339
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,766
That's right.

340
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,729
- A government pass.
- Yeah!

341
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,025
Oh, amazing city.

342
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:26,030
It's beautiful how your memories
stick with you, and the cities you love.

343
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,409
- Does it hurt to leave?
- Yeah. It always hurts to leave.

344
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,786
But I know I'll be back, though.

345
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:37,499
Dad, how do you deal
with your ego and your art?

346
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:38,875
You know...

347
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,086
you need confidence, sure.

348
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,339
- That's... I'm not denying that.
- Yeah.

349
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:47,176
But the... an ego is usually just, uh...

350
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,680
overdressed... insecurity.

351
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:52,764
Mm.

352
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:58,479
I think you have to dream so big
that you can't get an ego.

353
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,981
'Cause you'll never fulfill
all those dreams.

354
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,068
There's always more to come and learn.

355
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,696
I learned a lot from the old guys, too.

356
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:15,788
<i>I left the Lionel Hampton Band
and I was off to New York City</i>

357
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,791
<i>to follow my dream
of composing and arranging.</i>

358
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,295
<i>I lived with my wife, Jeri,
and our baby, Jolie.</i>

359
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,716
<i>This music called bebop
was being created in New York,</i>

360
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,511
<i>and I was dying to get closer to it.</i>

361
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,182
<i>I'd hang out at Birdland,
or other bars and clubs,</i>

362
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,934
<i>always looking for the next job.</i>

363
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:39,645
<i>I wrote for anybody who would pay.</i>

364
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:45,067
<i>I met a singer named Dinah Washington
and she became a great friend to me.</i>

365
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,320
<i>Dinah said, "I want you
to write my next record."</i>

366
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:52,241
<i>Her label, Mercury Records, said,
"Nope, we want a name."</i>

367
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,119
<i>Dinah said, "Here's a name for your ass.</i>

368
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,830
<i>Dinah Washington,
and Quincy Jones is my arranger."</i>

369
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,457
<i>The record was a big success.</i>

370
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,793
<i>After that, the work started to flow.</i>

371
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,838
<i>I did hundreds
of arrangements and recordings</i>

372
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,340
<i>with the absolute best in the business.</i>

373
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,133
<i>Louis Armstrong,</i>

374
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:11,969
<i>Count Basie,</i>

375
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,554
<i>Sarah Vaughan,</i>

376
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,055
<i>Clark Terry,</i>

377
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:16,556
<i>Dizzy Gillespie,</i>

378
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,268
<i>and my buddy, Ray Charles.</i>

379
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:23,022
<i>To really describe
the true soul in his arrangements,</i>

380
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:25,107
<i>I can't really put it into words.</i>

381
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:29,236
It's just a feeling
that you can feel it all down in here,

382
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,864
and before you know it,
you're tapping your toe, you know?

383
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,074
<i>With the work came money,</i>

384
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,993
<i>and with the money came temptations.</i>

385
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,662
<i>Women and money and work came together</i>

386
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,706
<i>and I embraced them all.</i>

387
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:45,544
<i>I was at a higher altitude
than I had ever dreamed possible.</i>

388
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,714
<i>But I didn't know what was coming.</i>

389
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:55,763
<i>My mother had searched for me for years
before finding me.</i>

390
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,015
<i>God knows how she did it.</i>

391
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,101
<i>She was a schizophrenic.</i>

392
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,062
<i>Dementia praecox, they call it.</i>

393
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:08,525
<i>I remember the first time I played
in Birdland with my own big band,</i>

394
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,487
<i>and that is really
a serious dream to come true.</i>

395
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,489
<i>My mother came,</i>

396
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:17,618
<i>and when she walks in the door,
boy, you know, you can't ignore her.</i>

397
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,995
<i>I knew she was gonna raise hell.</i>

398
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,955
<i>So she came in and people said,</i>

399
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,458
<i>"Sorry, ma'am, but you can't
come in here without a ticket."</i>

400
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,251
<i>She just said, "Get out of the way!"</i>

401
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,545
<i>I'm on the bandstand, trying to look cool,</i>

402
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:29,629
<i>and it was pitiful.</i>

403
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:31,799
<i>I was so embarrassed.</i>

404
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,844
<i>She said, "God doesn't like sinners.</i>

405
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:39,223
<i>Make music for God only
or you'll be redeemed in hell."</i>

406
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,477
<i>I just closed down.</i>

407
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,941
<i>Count Basie was like a father to me.</i>

408
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,695
<i>"Learn to deal with the valleys, Quincy,"
he advised.</i>

409
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,490
<i>"The hills will take care of themselves."</i>

410
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,204
<i>I wanted to write
different kinds of music,</i>

411
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,956
<i>you know, more than just jazz.</i>

412
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,041
<i>Because in those days, in New York,</i>

413
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,961
<i>they wouldn't let the black arrangers
write for strings.</i>

414
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:14,716
<i>I moved to Paris in 1957</i>

415
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,386
<i>so that I could study
with Nadia Boulanger,</i>

416
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,888
<i>the queen of classical music.</i>

417
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,935
<i>This was a lady
that was Igor Stravinsky's mentor,</i>

418
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,646
<i>and she also taught Leonard Bernstein.</i>

419
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,234
<i>I said, "I really want to know
everything I can about orchestration."</i>

420
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:34,987
<i>Her words stick with me a lot.</i>

421
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,240
<i>She said,
"Quincy, there are only 12 notes.</i>

422
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,701
<i>There really are only 12 notes,</i>

423
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,997
<i>and you should really investigate
what everybody did with these 12 notes."</i>

424
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,624
<i>And I never forgot that.</i>

425
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:53,797
<i>In Paris, I did 200 sessions
with huge string sections</i>

426
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,758
<i>and wrote for strings
until it came out of my ears.</i>

427
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:03,140
<i>France made me feel free as an artist
and as a black man.</i>

428
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,902
- Got so much shit going on.
- Yeah.

429
00:28:14,985 --> 00:28:17,946
That's an understatement, isn't it?
What's next?

430
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,032
Uh, the contracts.

431
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,910
- I shouldn't sign this?
- Um, no, I wouldn't.

432
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:23,994
- Okay.
- Not yet.

433
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:27,581
Not until he sends you something
that's even remotely acceptable.

434
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,167
- Great magazine. Jesus.
- Isn't it awesome?

435
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,919
Does it say anything on the Internet?

436
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,254
Who else is involved in that?

437
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,173
It's an understatement to say that.

438
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,591
Put that in there too.

439
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,259
How you doing, honey?

440
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,969
- What you got, some pills?
- Yeah.

441
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,804
- I'll take 'em.
- You have...? Okay.

442
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,475
I'll definitely take 'em.

443
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,478
What else is on the list?

444
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,232
The African-American Museum Smithsonian.

445
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,818
Uh, they want you to produce
a TV special for the opening.

446
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,197
Oh, the African-American
Smithsonian Institute,

447
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,532
um, right in front
of the Lincoln Memorial.

448
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,369
And they asked me to produce it?

449
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,496
Then I'm gonna produce it.

450
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,456
It's very...

451
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:11,708
special, though.

452
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,628
Yeah, it's a pretty incredible
honor that you're...

453
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,506
- Yeah, we gotta kill it, man.
- Who do you want for this show?

454
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:21,635
It should be the top of every... category.

455
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:26,014
Well, my immediate choice
would be Oprah, Will, and Jazzy Jeff.

456
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,393
- Okay, add Will Smith and DJ Jazzy Jeff.
- Yep.

457
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,353
Mary J. Blige.

458
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,853
John Legend.

459
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,691
- You want Herbie, right?
- Oh, for always.

460
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,508
We should send a "save the date"...

461
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,504
- To all these people
- To all these artists.

462
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,988
Yeah, definitely.

463
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,864
Stevie for sure.

464
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:43,948
Usher.

465
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,034
My brother, Colin Powell.

466
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,327
Dave Chappelle.

467
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,956
Naturally, we should have the First Lady
and President on there.

468
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,834
So cool, man... So cool!

469
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,420
These are important moments in history

470
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,964
and we're getting to watch
how it goes down.

471
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,132
It's exciting.

472
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,052
Another serious challenge.

473
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,136
God...

474
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,890
I love how I always end up jumping
into all this stuff, I can't believe it.

475
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,225
Because it's not easy.

476
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,979
Daddy got me to do that.

477
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:19,985
He always said, "Once a... task has
just begun, never leave it till it's done.

478
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:23,572
Be the labor great or small,
do it well or not at all."

479
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,533
Every day, he told us that.

480
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:34,833
<i>In 1959, I had assembled
a dream big band</i>

481
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,877
<i>for a show called </i>Free and Easy.

482
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,548
<i>It was the greatest band
I could ever dream of.</i>

483
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,973
<i>After six weeks, the show closed.</i>

484
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,477
<i>I couldn't stand it.</i>

485
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,772
<i>So I stood up and told the band,</i>

486
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,399
<i>"Let's stay here and tough it out."</i>

487
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,028
<i>Every single one of them agreed.</i>

488
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,326
<i>But after ten months
of hauling 30 people across Europe,</i>

489
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:11,203
<i>I started to break down.</i>

490
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,498
<i>We were stuck over there.</i>

491
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,751
<i>I had no money. I didn't know what to do.</i>

492
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,129
<i>It was time to go home.</i>

493
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:26,802
The band and myself, we'd like to say
<i>auf Wiedersehen, au revoir, </i>and goodbye.

494
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,889
<i>For the first time in my adult life,</i>

495
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,225
<i>I went out and got me a real job.</i>

496
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,815
<i>I was working as an executive
at Mercury Records</i>

497
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:44,361
<i>trying to get from under the $145,000 debt
from the</i> Free and Easy <i>tour.</i>

498
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:48,907
<i>I said, "Well, pop music is not
that big a deal, you know, to do."</i>

499
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,790
<i>And they just kept saying, "Well, why
don't you do something about it?"</i>

500
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,913
<i>It turned out to be
a little harder than I thought.</i>

501
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:58,792
<i>Plowing through piles of demo tapes,
listening to bad songs.</i>

502
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,629
<i>One afternoon,
they tossed a tape down the table.</i>

503
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,674
<i>I said, "I'd like
to take a shot with this."</i>

504
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:10,220
<i>It was a 16-year-old kid from New Jersey
named Lesley Gore.</i>

505
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,140
<i>We cut a single called "It's My Party".</i>

506
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,815
<i>It went to number one.</i>

507
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,276
<i>We had 18 hits with Lesley.</i>

508
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,574
<i>It was hard
being married to Quincy, you know.</i>

509
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,701
<i>There was so much infidelity</i>

510
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:37,164
<i>and he had so much ambition,
and that got in the way.</i>

511
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,416
<i>And I always felt he loved me,</i>

512
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,127
<i>but I was the wife at home
and he went out,</i>

513
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,338
<i>and he had a lot of good times without me,</i>

514
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,799
<i>and he grew in ways that I wasn't growing.</i>

515
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,887
<i>That was why we got divorced.</i>

516
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,228
<i>I had messed that marriage up.</i>

517
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,231
<i>Like my daddy before me,</i>

518
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,108
<i>I focused on work.</i>

519
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,247
Man, let's hang.

520
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,624
- Okay.
- I'm serious, man.

521
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,876
- You serious?
- There ain't many of us left!

522
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,253
- Is there?
- You got it.

523
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,550
Miss ya, man.

524
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,928
Q... How you feelin', boss?

525
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,347
- Thank you for the other night, man.
- Oh, any time.

526
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,470
- It was great.
- Any time.

527
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,849
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

528
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,328
- How old are you now?
- Eighty-nine!

529
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,561
I'm right behind you.

530
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:42,687
How are you, sweetheart?

531
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,411
- I'm really good.
- You're burning, girl!

532
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,566
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, man.

533
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,904
These cats been dropping
out of here like flies, man.

534
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:51,863
I don't like it.

535
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:54,324
Jesus Christ, man, we lost Louis Johnson,

536
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,785
Lesley Gore, Clark Terry.

537
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,869
It don't stop.

538
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:01,581
George Duke, Joe Sample.
It's fuckin' insane, man.

539
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,624
Insane.

540
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,420
Tonight, we are gathered together
to honor...

541
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:12,050
and pay tribute to my dear, dear friend

542
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:16,012
and present him
with this year's humanitarian award.

543
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,097
God bless all of you people
for being here tonight.

544
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,184
You have no idea
what you've done to this...

545
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,228
to make this soul smile tonight.

546
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,480
It's just unbelievable and it's, uh...

547
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,732
I'm only 82, you know, so...

548
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:35,991
I was very ill
at the beginning of this year... and...

549
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:41,121
they... say that cliché, you know,
"I almost died."

550
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,204
Well, I did.

551
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,165
And then I got a...

552
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,084
email from heaven,

553
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,752
and it said, "Brother Jones,

554
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:52,382
we already got Ray Charles,
Frank Sinatra, Charlie Parker,

555
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,843
Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, and stuff.

556
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,845
We don't need any more headaches
up here, man.

557
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,931
Stay home.
Keep your black booty home."

558
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:09,774
<i>I was sitting in my office
one day in New York in '64</i>

559
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:11,067
<i>and the phone rang.</i>

560
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,861
<i>I picked it up.</i>

561
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,989
<i>I heard him say, "This is Frank Sinatra.</i>

562
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,700
<i>I like what you and Basie did together</i>

563
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,828
<i>and I'd like you to arrange and conduct
my next album,</i>

564
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,580
It Might As Well Be Swing.

565
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:29,169
<i>That call from Frank was a major
turning point in my career and my life.</i>

566
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,130
<i>He tested me in the beginning.</i>

567
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:35,050
<i>And he said,
"That instrumentation's a little too...</i>

568
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,594
<i>dense in the first eight bars."</i>

569
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,512
<i>I said, "No problem, man."</i>

570
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,351
<i>Well, he'd go ten feet away
where there was a table or a desk,</i>

571
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,311
<i>and he'd fix it in no time.</i>

572
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:49,147
<i>It always amazed me
that a man could do that,</i>

573
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,858
<i>change all of those notes
that he had written before.</i>

574
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,362
<i>He was shocked,
'cause I was 29, right?</i>

575
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,530
<i>He was used to working with guys
that were 50.</i>

576
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,283
<i>After that, it was total trust, man.</i>

577
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:01,950
<i>Total trust.</i>

578
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,454
I would like to have you meet a gentleman

579
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,748
who's been doing
these marvelous orchestrations for me,

580
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,000
Mr. Quincy Jones, right there.

581
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,670
Q, Mr. Quincy Jones.

582
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,420
Thank you.

583
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:19,219
One of the bright young stars
in the orchestrating business.

584
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,136
Q, go ahead.

585
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,730
<i>Frank was just my style.</i>

586
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,733
<i>He was hip, straight-up
and straight-ahead,</i>

587
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,444
<i>and above all, a monster musician.</i>

588
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,246
<i>Quincy's drive
is what made the difference</i>

589
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,415
<i>in the recordings that I began to do.</i>

590
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:54,087
<i>The orchestra drove harder
than they did before the days with Quincy.</i>

591
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,007
<i>Frank was at the height
of his powers</i>

592
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,844
<i>and I was running his musical ship,</i>

593
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,971
<i>the greatest band in the world.</i>

594
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,195
<i>We became very fast friends,</i>

595
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,406
<i>forgetting about all the work
we had to do.</i>

596
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:25,201
<i>Frank led me
into a brand new world...</i>

597
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,705
<i>...a land of dreams and high living,</i>

598
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:32,292
<i>anything you felt like doing,
whenever you felt like doing it.</i>

599
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,587
<i>And making the music we both loved.</i>

600
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,429
<i>During this time, I was
with some of the finest women in the world</i>

601
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,515
<i>and had a brief affair
with a dancer named Carol.</i>

602
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,102
<i>My second lovely daughter, Rachel,
was born as a result.</i>

603
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,606
<i>It was a mind-boggling time.</i>

604
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:59,736
The astronauts on Apollo 10 took
a little tape recorder along with them

605
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:04,699
and they played that tune back to Earth
from about 150,000 miles in space.

606
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,661
<i>This is just so that you guys
don't forget what your job is down there.</i>

607
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:09,745
<i>We're ready.</i>

608
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:18,147
<i>Frank called up when they played
that music on the moon, like a little kid.</i>

609
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:21,549
<i>"Can you believe that, man?" I said,
"No, man, the first music on the moon?</i>

610
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,843
<i>Give me a break, man."
You can't plan that!</i>

611
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,349
<i>Frank was so buzzed about Basie's band</i>

612
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:33,311
<i>that he took the entire band
to Las Vegas in 1964.</i>

613
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,607
<i>Vegas was mob territory back then.</i>

614
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,943
<i>No black entertainer in their right mind</i>

615
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,237
<i>would wander around
those casino hotels alone.</i>

616
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,824
<i>It was a trip 'cause Sammy Davis,</i>

617
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,909
<i>or Lena Horne, Belafonte,</i>

618
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,745
<i>they used to work in the big room
as the stars,</i>

619
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,914
<i>but they had to eat in the kitchen.</i>

620
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,499
<i>They couldn't go in the casino</i>

621
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,293
<i>and they had to sleep
in the black hotels across town.</i>

622
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,840
<i>Bigotry is a terrible disease,
it's a very bad disease.</i>

623
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,093
<i>I began to make noise about it.</i>

624
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,447
<i>I said, "If they all have to live
on the other side of town,</i>

625
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,681
<i>then you don't need me."</i>

626
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:14,561
<i>Suddenly, it changed.
And I can't explain to you what happened.</i>

627
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,231
<i>Frank, by himself,
stopped all that.</i>

628
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,650
<i>He said, "We're gonna fix this shit."</i>

629
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,317
<i>And he did.</i>

630
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:27,240
<i>He took Sammy, Basie, and myself
and changed the whole racial situation.</i>

631
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:40,295
<i>Working with Basie and Quincy
was the most exciting engagement</i>

632
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,839
<i>I have ever done in my life
since I've been performing.</i>

633
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,550
Jump, Q, jump!

634
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,180
<i>Quincy had a key to the Basie band...</i>

635
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:54,183
<i>more than any other orchestrator
that I know of.</i>

636
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,065
<i>And I began to realize
that he was a giant.</i>

637
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,070
<i>I loved him, man.</i>

638
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,072
<i>I know he loved me too.</i>

639
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,492
<i>In all the years working together,</i>

640
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:12,994
<i>just like with Ray Charles,</i>

641
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,372
<i>we never once had a contract...
just a handshake.</i>

642
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,835
<i>Quincy turned out to be...</i>

643
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,755
<i>one of the finest musicians
that I've ever known.</i>

644
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:31,346
<i>After my time with Frank,
I wanted to move out of New York</i>

645
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,264
<i>and get into LA film scoring.</i>

646
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,644
<i>I didn't see blacks' names on the screens,
you know, as composers.</i>

647
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:40,063
<i>There weren't any black composers at all.</i>

648
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,232
<i>So I just took that chance.</i>

649
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:46,152
<i>I said, "I don't know, maybe I won't
make it out there, but I'm goin'."</i>

650
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,863
<i>A friend of mine was doing a movie,</i>

651
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:53,076
<i>and he said, "They're thinking
about Quincy Jones for a movie."</i>

652
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,453
<i>I said, "Yes, great, great."</i>

653
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:59,374
<i>He said, "Can black men
write movie music?"</i>

654
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,418
<i>I said, "Of course they can!"</i>

655
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:08,675
<i>There was a lot of reluctance...
"How can you write for a white star?"</i>

656
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:13,471
<i>I thought that it was just a dream
that I'd have to hold on to.</i>

657
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,772
First of all,
thank you very much for being...

658
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,649
- My pleasure, man.
- It's an honor.

659
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,484
I've been with <i>The Post </i>for a long time.

660
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:30,071
Why do you think it's taken so long
to get this thing done?

661
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:33,116
'Cause I read that it was like 1905
when they started talking about it.

662
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,759
But it's taken a long time
to keep them from shootin' black kids.

663
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:38,788
This happens...
Probably last night it happened. Come on.

664
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:42,375
'Cause the racism has been
buried and hidden, you know.

665
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,437
In the South, it's open, you know
who you're dealing with, but in the North,

666
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,381
it's disguised with all the bullshit,
you know.

667
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,064
- Yeah.
- And that's the problem.

668
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,171
So, this museum...
There are millions of museums here

669
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,345
but why is that museum
so important right now?

670
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,765
Well, young black kids need to know
where they come from.

671
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:02,729
Bebop, doo-wop, and hip hop, and all
that stuff is all sociological, you know.

672
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:07,692
Hopefully, the juice that we generate
about the museum is gonna help.

673
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,445
- Yeah.
- They say, "Hey, you gotta be part of this

674
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,196
for the young kids of tomorrow."

675
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,323
- Yeah.
- That's what's important for me.

676
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:15,825
- What...
- 'Cause it's big, man.

677
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,619
It's something
I've wanted all my life to see.

678
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,848
Can you tell me a little bit
about what's gonna happen?

679
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,582
- No.
- No? It's a total secret?

680
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,042
- Nothing.
- Under wraps?

681
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,418
- Nothing.
- Okay.

682
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,336
It's not a surprise if I tell you.

683
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:31,174
So I don't get anything,
no Stevie Wonder there or anything?

684
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,731
<i>- Tack så mycket.
- Varsågod.</i>

685
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,358
Lookin' good.

686
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,951
And do it to the camera, yeah.

687
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,915
Can I take one more?
Sitting, exactly like that.

688
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:04,998
Yeah.

689
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:14,383
- I'm fine, I'm happy.
- You cool? Good.

690
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:16,344
I'm tired, man, I'm sorry.

691
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,764
- It's an honor, thank you so much.
- My pleasure. <i>Tack så mycket.</i>

692
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:28,855
Hmm?

693
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,086
<i>When composers
get started on a film,</i>

694
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,549
<i>I think they spend the roughest parts
of it scraping away...</i>

695
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,886
<i>the bullshit, you know, in their life.</i>

696
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,515
<i>They have to really scrape away
so there's nothing left but truth.</i>

697
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,539
<i>Because I don't think you can write,
can't create anything without...</i>

698
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,023
<i>feeling right with the truth.</i>

699
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:44,659
<i>You have to find something
to grab a hold of to believe in,</i>

700
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,742
<i>or you can't write.</i>

701
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:54,293
<i>I can't say, "This'll be good enough,"
or your senses won't react.</i>

702
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:01,801
<i>You make a desperate escape
to get down into the subconscious,</i>

703
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,724
<i>which I really think
all the goodies come from.</i>

704
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:56,063
<i>After you finish the quiet moments
of writing,</i>

705
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,359
<i>I just like to groove with my family then,
and enjoy all of it.</i>

706
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,414
<i>My wife, Ulla,
she's from Stockholm originally,</i>

707
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:17,918
<i>and we have two kids that I just can't
stay away from for two minutes.</i>

708
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:28,304
<i>My biggest hobby is my family.</i>

709
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:31,807
<i>It's a complete contrast
to when we go in to record.</i>

710
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,603
- Ready with the playback, Quincy.
- Thank you.

711
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,813
<i>It's such a moment of tension</i>

712
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:40,232
<i>when you're trying to coordinate
so many elements...</i>

713
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:43,402
<i>when we're involved with technicians,
lots of musicians and...</i>

714
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,905
<i>lots of money being spent per hour,</i>

715
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,573
<i>and so the pace tightens up.</i>

716
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:48,991
Three and four, a 56.

717
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:51,202
<i>Everything has to come into play
at that time.</i>

718
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,891
<i>It's just beginning to become</i>

719
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,477
<i>so that it isn't such a sensationalism</i>

720
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,189
<i>to see interracial love relationships
or even, uh...</i>

721
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:24,527
<i>uh, the role of where the black man
really plays the role of a man,</i>

722
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,903
<i>rather than just a character.</i>

723
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:35,871
<i>But as my career
began to move forward...</i>

724
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,875
<i>my relationship with Ulla
was starting to show cracks.</i>

725
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:44,672
<i>I never came close
to being a perfect father.</i>

726
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,968
<i>But I always, always loved my kids deeply.</i>

727
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:55,307
<i>One day, Ulla announced she was
going to visit her mother in Sweden.</i>

728
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,895
<i>I didn't want her to take the kids along
but there was no arguing.</i>

729
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,358
<i>A week later, Ulla called from Sweden</i>

730
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:08,112
<i>and adamantly proclaimed
that she was not coming back, period.</i>

731
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:11,532
<i>She was staying there
and keeping the kids.</i>

732
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:15,870
<i>My heart fell to my feet.</i>

733
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:21,667
<i>I couldn't handle it.</i>

734
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,396
- What time do we start?
- Now, sir.

735
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:36,056
Let's hit it.

736
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,144
<i>- Hur mår du pappa?
- Skit bra.</i>

737
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,608
So, you have an incredible work ethic,

738
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,568
and, I mean, I've never seen
anything like it.

739
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,612
I mean, at no point in my life

740
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:52,490
have I ever been able
to hang with you 24/7 and I can keep up.

741
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,074
It's... it's crazy.

742
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,785
Where did that come from?
And what is in your water?

743
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,829
It's probably from not having a mother.

744
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,789
You know, really, yeah.

745
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:05,294
At seven, we were, like, deserted.
They took her away to this mental home.

746
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:09,006
And my grandmother
was an ex-slave, you know.

747
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:12,718
America's just trying to get over
that... that part of their history

748
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:16,764
'cause it was terrible, terrible, man,
and we experienced it, you know.

749
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,141
Ray Charles and I used to say,
back in the '40s,

750
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:23,270
"Not one drop of my self-worth
depends on your acceptance of me."

751
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,564
Because you can't be that vulnerable.

752
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:29,735
Not back then, the '30s and '40s.
The '50s, man?! You kidding?

753
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,369
Oh, hey, look at this, man!

754
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,787
You know I love that.

755
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:41,329
Mm-hm.

756
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:45,501
Jesus Christ, I'll take it.

757
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,214
They're killing me!

758
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,424
Sometimes I step in too deep.
Like, look at that.

759
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:57,012
We go to Georgia,
the Black Sea Festival in Georgia, Russia.

760
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:58,639
Then we go to Zurich.

761
00:50:58,722 --> 00:50:59,722
Then...

762
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,393
the big one, the Smithsonian.

763
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,479
We produce the Smithsonian,
African-American Museum.

764
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:09,275
Obama, uh, he cuts the ribbon at noon.

765
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:11,402
And we come back at night
and do a two-hour special

766
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,737
that's got the whole history, almost,
of black music.

767
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,614
- Wow.
- It's a hard job.

768
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:19,285
But I mean, my whole life has
been like that, though. I like that.

769
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:26,750
Look at that architecture. God damn, baby!

770
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,594
Hey!

771
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:44,101
I want you to give it up
for Alfredo Rodriguez. Alfredo!

772
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:57,382
Is there a commonality
between these artists you worked with?

773
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:59,533
Yes. Individuality,

774
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,994
distinctive personalities,

775
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:03,411
and sounds.

776
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,165
Ray Charles, Count Basie, Clark Terry,

777
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,459
they put me on their shoulders,
so it's an honor for me

778
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,295
to put the young people on my shoulders.
It is an honor.

779
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,134
How you doing, man? You doing okay?

780
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:40,365
Welcome.

781
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,408
<i>Hur mar du.</i>

782
00:52:41,492 --> 00:52:42,910
First time here in the office?

783
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,161
- In the office, yeah.
- Yeah.

784
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,954
- Sweden, 63 years.
- Yeah, I <i>know</i> it.

785
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:47,038
Oh, man.

786
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:49,625
You going to save the record business?

787
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,628
- Hopefully, that's what we hope for.
- It needs some saving.

788
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,967
Justin Kauflin, come on. Give it up.

789
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,494
- It's good to see you.
- You guys are bad motherfuckers, man.

790
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:10,270
- Oh, boy.
- You are the future, brother.

791
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:20,155
That is the power of music,
to bring the people of the world together.

792
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,544
Look at these cars, man. Look at this.

793
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,171
That's just Chicago in the '30s, man.

794
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:38,507
Mr. Quincy Jones!

795
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:45,055
I came up in that school of, like,
all kind, every kind of music.

796
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:47,057
There's just two kinds, bad and good.

797
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:55,899
I just got back from, uh, Hong Kong
and Abu Dhabi and Dubai,

798
00:53:55,983 --> 00:54:00,237
so I'm a little turned around here,
so bear along with me, okay?

799
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:02,739
Uh...

800
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,907
Tonight...

801
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,077
is a powerful foray...

802
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,580
into... Jesus!

803
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,417
I'm falling down here.

804
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,376
Glenn!

805
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,383
Jesus Christ.

806
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,342
Glenn!

807
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:43,822
How's your pain right now?

808
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,033
- I don't have any.
- No pain? Good.

809
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,826
Okay, very good. Okay.

810
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,707
Dad, did they tell you that
there's any way to prevent blood clots?

811
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,042
- Did they tell you?
- No.

812
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,460
Exercise.

813
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,938
- Exercise, compression socks.
- Yeah, not sedentary.

814
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,255
- Yeah.
- Sedentary.

815
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:01,548
- Yeah.
- What socks?

816
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:04,301
- Compression socks.
- Yes, I know... about that.

817
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:08,639
Did they say it was
from, yeah, traveling, Dad?

818
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:11,517
Traveling is worse if you don't exercise.

819
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,728
He's traveling too much.

820
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:21,819
Can I listen to your lungs
real quick? Just take a second.

821
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,910
You had kind of a close call, you know?

822
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,329
If you've got a big clot like that
that sneaks up through,

823
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,612
it's a clot this long,
I mean, that can be sudden death.

824
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:35,665
Oh, man.

825
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:36,875
You got any travel coming up?

826
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,962
I was supposed to go to Washington,
I was supposed to go to Europe.

827
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,463
You gotta be careful, I think,

828
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:44,150
especially the first few weeks
after something like this, you know.

829
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,759
I want to start exercising too.

830
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:49,596
I honestly, I thought, 90 percent chance
you come out in a wheelchair.

831
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,349
- Really? No way.
- I... That got me very excited.

832
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:55,352
- I'm glad to hear that.
- I'm a responder and a survivor.

833
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:11,243
<i>After my marriage to Ulla
broke up,</i>

834
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:14,121
<i>I was determined
not to hook up seriously with anyone.</i>

835
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:23,297
<i>I met Peggy Lipton in 1972.</i>

836
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:29,052
<i>She was a beautiful star
of a hot TV series, </i>The Mod Squad,

837
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,723
<i>the first young hip drama on TV.</i>

838
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,435
<i>She was independent, smart,</i>

839
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,478
<i>beautiful, and understanding.</i>

840
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:43,984
<i>When we met,
the chemistry was so strong.</i>

841
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:46,570
<i>I just was so drawn to him.</i>

842
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:49,323
<i>He came into my life and that was it.</i>

843
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:50,824
<i>It was like I knew.</i>

844
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:56,038
<i>After we met, it was so instantaneous
that he just moved in.</i>

845
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,540
<i>It was, like, two weeks later, he was in.</i>

846
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,462
<i>Falling in love with Peggy
was like a breath of fresh air.</i>

847
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:17,017
<i>We said, "We'll do this
as long as we feel good."</i>

848
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,062
<i>We never even talked of marriage.</i>

849
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:24,232
<i>We didn't feel that a piece of paper
was necessary to keep us together.</i>

850
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:46,088
<i>All of her desires, her focus,
she gave to her family and to me,</i>

851
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,090
<i>so that I could get on with my career.</i>

852
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:55,722
<i>He was working himself like crazy.</i>

853
00:57:57,516 --> 00:58:01,311
<i>He was so determined to take himself
out of only a jazz musician,</i>

854
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:03,981
<i>to take himself
out of only a movie composer,</i>

855
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:05,774
<i>and to go the next step with that.</i>

856
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,736
<i>Duke Ellington said,
"I want you to be one of the people</i>

857
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,072
<i>that help to de-categorize
American music."</i>

858
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,116
<i>He passed the baton down.</i>

859
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:22,666
In order for music to grow,
the critics must stop categorizing

860
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,127
and let the musicians get involved

861
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,254
in all different facets of music.

862
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:31,383
We will die if we get stuck
in one area of music.

863
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:43,063
<i>Tonight, the Academy Awards orchestra</i>

864
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:47,899
<i>will be conducted by three-time
Oscar nominee Quincy Jones!</i>

865
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,768
<i>One day he just, um...</i>

866
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,560
<i>collapsed.</i>

867
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:29,399
<i>And I called 9-1-1 right away.</i>

868
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:35,113
<i>When we took him to the hospital,
he... he wasn't conscious.</i>

869
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:54,758
<i>And I was just, like,
how could one moment be so perfect</i>

870
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:57,469
<i>and the next moment
your whole life is falling apart.</i>

871
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:02,599
<i>It was like a cannon
had blasted through my head.</i>

872
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:07,437
<i>What happens is the main vessel
to your brain... pops.</i>

873
01:00:07,813 --> 01:00:09,898
<i>They operated for seven and a half hours.</i>

874
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:15,529
<i>At the end of the operation,
my neurosurgeons came in and said,</i>

875
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,572
<i>"The good news is you lived.</i>

876
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:21,201
<i>The bad news is
we found another one on the other side</i>

877
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,495
<i>that could be ready to explode
at any minute.</i>

878
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:26,706
<i>In two months,
we have to go back in again."</i>

879
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:32,379
<i>The first thing that you think about
are all the things that were, like,</i>

880
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,464
<i>things I'm going to get around to.</i>

881
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:37,968
<i>Like my daughter hadn't called me "Daddy".</i>

882
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:40,345
<i>And all of the things that I hadn't done,</i>

883
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:43,473
<i>all these crazy, wild things
in your imagination</i>

884
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,183
<i>that you hadn't even started on.</i>

885
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,813
It's nature's way
of getting your attention.

886
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:55,152
You know, to make you live your life,
you know, really live it and... and...

887
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:58,905
dig down for the values
that really mean something.

888
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:04,369
<i>With our baby Kidada
six months old,</i>

889
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:08,123
<i>and the other operation looming
a few weeks away,</i>

890
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:11,209
<i>we decided to marry.</i>

891
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:25,849
<i>You realize, uh...
the true essence of time.</i>

892
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:30,520
<i>And you tell your friends
you love them... now!</i>

893
01:01:32,147 --> 01:01:33,982
<i>Not tomorrow or next week.</i>

894
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,109
<i>Let them feel your love.</i>

895
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,341
I asked the doctor afterwards,
"What is that...

896
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:02,594
What was going on at that time?"
And he said, "You were dying, you know."

897
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:07,557
I had to try to rehabilitate, you know,
go through therapy to be able to write

898
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:11,186
because it's frightening to see, you know,
those big jagged edges,

899
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,729
when you're trying to write again.

900
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:14,481
And dropouts in...

901
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:16,315
memory.

902
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:18,215
So that's scary, that's frightening.

903
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,570
I mean, people real close to you,
it just disappears.

904
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,865
What's important to you now?

905
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:26,785
Uh, contributing something...

906
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:30,080
that you don't really get anything
in return for.

907
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,089
<i>We were grateful.</i>

908
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,633
<i>We were grateful for a lot of things.</i>

909
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:45,262
<i>And, uh, people were just amazed
at his recovery.</i>

910
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,264
<i>And then we had another baby.</i>

911
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:57,274
Happy anniversary to us.
Happy anniversary to us.

912
01:02:58,358 --> 01:02:59,234
Isn't that wild?

913
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:03,697
<i>When you come back,</i>

914
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:08,785
<i>all of the dreams you have, you say,
"You'd better go for it, now," you know?</i>

915
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,628
<i>You can't put that off, you know.
It's not...</i>

916
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:14,624
<i>I'd rather say, uh, "I'm sorry I did,"
rather than "I wish I had," you know?</i>

917
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:22,172
Gigi!

918
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:23,842
- Hi.
- How's my baby?

919
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,844
- Are you hungry?
- A little bit.

920
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,189
So much fun, man.

921
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:40,608
What's this, love?

922
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:43,778
It's just something I found
going through one of the boxes.

923
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:46,573
Oh, my God.

924
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:48,907
Wow.

925
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:50,994
I haven't seen this in 50 years.

926
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:53,580
I got accurate records of everything.

927
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,834
How much I was getting...
Jesus Christ, look at all those!

928
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:00,128
Nineteen arrangements,
twenty dollars apiece.

929
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,296
Lord have mercy.

930
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:04,973
- Twenty dollars apiece.
- What year was that?

931
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:08,303
Twelve dollars! God damn! 1952.

932
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:09,888
Twelve dollars an arrangement.

933
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:11,598
Jesus Christ.

934
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,601
But I was happy
'cause I wasn't starving to death.

935
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:18,354
What else you got?

936
01:04:19,606 --> 01:04:20,606
Wow.

937
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:24,402
Boy, time is a bitch, man. Look at that.

938
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:27,781
- Is that you?
- That's my yearbook picture.

939
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,159
Look at that belly, man.

940
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,535
That's a big belly, man.

941
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:34,286
Wow.

942
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,498
It takes you back, honey.

943
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:39,167
Look at Daddy.

944
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:41,378
He was always happy.

945
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:42,962
Oh, he was a beautiful man.

946
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:45,547
Oh, my God.

947
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,011
- My mother.
- Yeah.

948
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:51,929
Oh, Sarah.

949
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:54,681
Wow.

950
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:57,643
Heavy.

951
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:00,939
What the hell is this?

952
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:04,567
"This is filled with lies."

953
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:05,651
Who said that?

954
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:09,197
I have no idea, what is that?

955
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,993
"Everybody spoke well of you
until you scandalized your mother."

956
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:16,162
This looks like your mother's writing.

957
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:17,414
- I know.
- Typewriter.

958
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:21,042
"That is what happens when you listen
to evil communications." That's her.

959
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,212
My mother, she was mad
when she read this article.

960
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:27,173
I never saw this stuff before.

961
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:31,845
"The cake is what made you
lose all of your teeth.

962
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:36,391
I insisted on good food. Even so, that's
when I tossed the cake in a garbage can."

963
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:38,225
Oh, God.

964
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:41,771
That's sad.

965
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,794
<i>Quincy's mother, Sarah,
was there as a shadow.</i>

966
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:07,964
<i>As a shadow of...</i>

967
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,592
<i>who he could become.</i>

968
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:16,806
<i>He worried that maybe he had
that mental illness like her.</i>

969
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,727
<i>She would come back into our lives
through...</i>

970
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:23,104
<i>you know, wanting to see
the grandchildren.</i>

971
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:28,276
<i>Quincy just would go
into a full cold sweat around her.</i>

972
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:32,864
<i>She pushed his buttons in a way
that we could never understand.</i>

973
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:38,745
<i>Of the word mother, you know,
it doesn't mean too much to me.</i>

974
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,539
<i>I don't know what it is, you know.</i>

975
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:45,001
<i>I guess trauma gets frozen at the peak.</i>

976
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:49,088
<i>It was really seriously damaging.</i>

977
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:54,093
<i>I'm sure that affected my relationship
with a lot of women later, you know.</i>

978
01:06:56,012 --> 01:07:00,934
<i>They're feelings that I'm...
to this day, I'm still wrestling with.</i>

979
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,233
Isn't it astounding, man,

980
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:12,946
when you look at the reality
of us having the same twelve notes

981
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,198
for 710 years.

982
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:16,866
- Everybody.
- Amazing, right?

983
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:19,786
Brahms, Beethoven, Basie,
Bo Diddley, Bird.

984
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:22,288
The same fucking 12 notes.

985
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,249
It's heavy, man. Isn't it?

986
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:26,334
- That's really heavy, right?
- It is heavy, man!

987
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:28,503
Seven hundred and ten years!

988
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:30,797
- That... that is quite amazing.
- Shit!

989
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,723
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- And then something to do like this one.

990
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:47,272
Where's that B, where's that B?

991
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:51,401
Do it again, like this.

992
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:54,236
- Uh-huh.
- Like that?

993
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:37,238
We're still dealing
with the climactic part of the octaves.

994
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:40,325
- Those octaves, you can't follow 'em.
- Mm-hmm.

995
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:43,578
I'm just saying, just let them have
a little bit at a time, you know?

996
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:44,996
Of course, yeah.

997
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,566
- What do you think?
- I think it's ready for the painting.

998
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:49,292
- Yeah?
- Ready for some paint.

999
01:08:51,336 --> 01:08:55,173
Richard, the other stuff is very legato
and everything else,

1000
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:58,635
so let's do the contrast and keep it
so it's a little bit more percussive.

1001
01:08:58,718 --> 01:08:59,552
Okay.

1002
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:05,807
Yeah!

1003
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,146
Yeah.

1004
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,487
- Yes!
- Whoo!

1005
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:18,780
I think that he's great.

1006
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:20,156
He's great, man.

1007
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:24,827
- It was a good day, man.
- Yeah.

1008
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:25,911
Good day.

1009
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:33,586
- No bass?
- We'll do the bass separate.

1010
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:34,796
- Okay.
- Do the guitar first

1011
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:36,339
so we can make a decision about it.

1012
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:39,676
"Light Up The Night", take two!

1013
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:52,939
My feeling is always leave
at least 20 or 30 percent of room

1014
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,941
for the Lord to walk through the room.

1015
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,737
Because, you know,
then you're leaving room for the magic

1016
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:02,073
and, uh, records are about

1017
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:04,742
capturing magic,
real magical moments, you know,

1018
01:10:04,826 --> 01:10:06,911
at that time, and capturing them on tape,
you know.

1019
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:09,997
I think that's what communicates,
is the magic of the moment.

1020
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:19,132
And... love is the other word, too.
When the love is in the studio,

1021
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,055
because that contributes more to magic
in the studio than anything else.

1022
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:33,187
<i>I guess this is the most exciting period
of my life.</i>

1023
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:49,704
You don't in any way
find it exhausting creatively?

1024
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:52,373
It's the best thing for me
because it gives me a chance

1025
01:10:52,457 --> 01:10:53,457
to get everything out

1026
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:57,795
and, uh, get involved with the whole
eclectic world which I love,

1027
01:10:57,879 --> 01:10:59,338
which is black music, period.

1028
01:10:59,422 --> 01:11:03,926
And also film scoring
just taps the right parts of me

1029
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,595
and makes me feel at ease.

1030
01:11:09,557 --> 01:11:12,894
<i>I think with </i>The Wiz,
<i>it was the next challenge for Quincy.</i>

1031
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:16,063
<i>And, of course, he put 110 percent in.</i>

1032
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:23,738
<i>Our whole family moved to New York
to be with him,</i>

1033
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:26,365
<i>and I took his two other children with me,</i>

1034
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:29,285
<i>and it was very difficult
'cause he was away every night.</i>

1035
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:31,662
Okay, we're back
with Michael Jackson,

1036
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:34,582
and you just coming off <i>The Wiz.</i>

1037
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:37,460
It was terrific.
It's something I always wanted to do,

1038
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:40,630
and, uh, it was a lot of fun
working with all the greats...

1039
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,590
Sidney Lumet, Quincy Jones...

1040
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:45,218
<i>When we were doing </i>The Wiz,

1041
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,720
<i>he asked me about,
could I find him a producer?</i>

1042
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:52,433
<i>At the time, we were heavily into the film
and so I didn't pay much attention.</i>

1043
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:55,728
Hey fellas, is today the day
you're gonna help me get down from here?

1044
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:58,064
<i>What I saw is discipline.</i>

1045
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:00,119
<i>He showed up
at five o'clock in the morning</i>

1046
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:02,527
<i>for a four-hour makeup job,
and then he stood around.</i>

1047
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:05,071
<i>He knew everybody's songs,
all of their lines,</i>

1048
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:08,783
<i>lyrics, dance steps, everything!
He just absorbed everything.</i>

1049
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:11,452
<i>And I started to see a maturity in him.</i>

1050
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:14,539
<i>And at that moment, I said,
"You've got a producer, man.</i>

1051
01:12:14,622 --> 01:12:16,207
<i>I'd like to take a shot at it."</i>

1052
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,961
<i>I felt he had the potential
to go way beyond</i>

1053
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:24,590
<i>the wonderful trademark bubblegum
he'd done on Motown with the Jackson 5.</i>

1054
01:12:26,926 --> 01:12:31,097
<i>When he was ready to record,
I got my "Killer Q" posse together.</i>

1055
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:33,766
<i>Rod "Worms" Temperton,</i>

1056
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:36,227
<i>one of the greatest songwriters
who ever lived.</i>

1057
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:38,563
<i>Bruce "Svensk" Swedien,</i>

1058
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:40,398
<i>Greg "Mouse" Phillinganes,</i>

1059
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:42,608
<i>Louis "Thunder Thumbs" Johnson,</i>

1060
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:44,485
<i>John "J.R." Robinson,</i>

1061
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:46,279
<i>Paulhino Da Costa,</i>

1062
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,864
<i>Jerry Hay,</i>

1063
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:49,448
<i>and many, many others.</i>

1064
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:51,659
<i>We attacked that record.</i>

1065
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:02,795
<i>We tried all kinds of things
I'd learned over the years</i>

1066
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:04,881
<i>to help him with his artistic growth.</i>

1067
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:08,009
<i>Things like dropping keys
just a minor third</i>

1068
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:10,887
<i>to give him more flexibility
and a more mature range.</i>

1069
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:15,433
<i>He was so shy, sometimes he'd sit down
and sing behind the couch</i>

1070
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:16,767
<i>with his back to me.</i>

1071
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:21,522
<i>Quincy saw that spark in Michael
that would make him a star.</i>

1072
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:23,858
<i>He definitely saw</i>

1073
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:27,403
<i>that there was something in Michael
that was needed in the world.</i>

1074
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,004
<i>You have to get something that,</i>

1075
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,782
<i>when we look at the end of a day,</i>

1076
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:34,869
<i>and I have goosebumps,
and Michael has goosebumps,</i>

1077
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,954
<i>then I think we've got something special,</i>

1078
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:40,291
<i>'cause we're all very hard to please
and not satisfied too easily.</i>

1079
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:43,586
<i>The resulting record,</i>
Off the Wall,

1080
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:46,672
<i>was the biggest-selling black record
in history at that time.</i>

1081
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,593
<i>Quincy Jones is hard
to put in a musical category.</i>

1082
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:51,844
<i>His most recent production</i>

1083
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:54,555
<i>of Michael Jackson's hit album</i>
Off The Wall

1084
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:56,098
<i>was a smash success.</i>

1085
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:59,226
<i>It sold over eight million copies
and got award upon award.</i>

1086
01:13:59,894 --> 01:14:01,479
<i>Off The Wall,</i> Michael Jackson.

1087
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:02,647
Michael Jackson.

1088
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:04,023
Michael Jackson.

1089
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:06,817
Thank you, Quincy Jones.

1090
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:09,570
Thank you, my mother and father
and all the beautiful fans

1091
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:12,365
who bought, you know, the record,
and, uh...

1092
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:16,410
God, I really appreciate it. I love it.
Thank you very much.

1093
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:18,996
<i>Well, Quincy
really had to nurture Michael,</i>

1094
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:22,667
<i>and part of their relationship
was that of a mentor and his protégé.</i>

1095
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:27,088
<i>But I think Quincy was also
a father figure to him.</i>

1096
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,048
In the pocket!

1097
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,840
<i>The making of </i>Thriller
<i>in a little more than two months</i>

1098
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,283
<i>was like riding a rocket.</i>

1099
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,702
<i>Everything about it
was done at hyperspeed.</i>

1100
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:44,206
<i>Rod Temperton, who also co-wrote
several of the album's songs, and I</i>

1101
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:48,377
<i>listened to nearly 600 songs
before picking out a dozen we liked.</i>

1102
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:51,964
<i>We all worked ourselves
into a near frenzy.</i>

1103
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,133
<i>I called Michael "Smelly"</i>

1104
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:57,053
<i>because when he liked a piece of music
or a certain beat,</i>

1105
01:15:57,136 --> 01:16:00,264
<i>instead of calling it funky,
he'd call it "smelly jelly".</i>

1106
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:02,659
- Incredible!
- Yeah?

1107
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:05,144
- Yeah!
- One more, son, one more.

1108
01:16:05,603 --> 01:16:07,188
Cut! Once more, right away.

1109
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:08,898
- Here we go!
- Right away.

1110
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:10,566
And re-cue. Let's go, right away.

1111
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,402
Okay, here we go, ready, and...

1112
01:16:14,028 --> 01:16:18,449
We're working on a... a movie short,
which is like ten minutes,

1113
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:21,994
for the <i>Thriller </i>album,
the song "Thriller",

1114
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:25,122
and it's really exciting, what happens.

1115
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:28,250
Michael, I think this is gonna be
the <i>Citizen Kane</i> of the videos.

1116
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:29,168
I really do.

1117
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:33,297
It's going to be the most revolutionary
thing in the history of videos, you know.

1118
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:38,219
<i>The single "Thriller" was
the first 14-minute music video ever made</i>

1119
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:41,722
<i>and was treated like the premiere
of a feature film around the world.</i>

1120
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:50,815
<i>Michael was splashed all over the globe
visually as well as musically.</i>

1121
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:56,028
<i>Michael, the MTV videos, and the music,
all rode each other to glory.</i>

1122
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,812
"Dear Quincy, we are all part
of history in the making."

1123
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:00,865
All right.

1124
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:08,916
<i>I don't think anyone would have
known how far it was gonna go.</i>

1125
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:15,756
<i>Several people in the crowd
of 5,000 fainted.</i>

1126
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,466
<i>Police struggled to maintain order.</i>

1127
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:20,928
<i>One fan said, "I thought I was
going to get killed, but it was worth it."</i>

1128
01:17:44,869 --> 01:17:47,997
Michael!

1129
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:53,502
And producer of the year is...
Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson!

1130
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:54,586
Yes!

1131
01:17:58,299 --> 01:18:00,801
We'd like to thank the people
that make this work.

1132
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:02,343
My wife...

1133
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:07,141
who chose to take care of me
rather than pursue her own career...

1134
01:18:07,725 --> 01:18:09,310
and our family, and I love her.

1135
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:12,605
And Michael Jackson...

1136
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,107
I think one of the greatest entertainers
of the 20th century.

1137
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:16,692
I mean that from all my heart.

1138
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,633
Beautiful, beautiful.

1139
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:43,677
Great... great bass sound
on the synths, man.

1140
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:44,970
Love it.

1141
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:46,388
One of my favorite sounds.

1142
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:51,936
One, two, three.

1143
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,813
If I don't see you before,

1144
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:56,208
- have a great holidays.
- You too.

1145
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:59,068
- I'll send you some shots, love you.
- I love you back.

1146
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:02,988
Hmm. Quite a history!

1147
01:19:11,330 --> 01:19:13,332
- Hi!
- How are you, sweetheart?

1148
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:16,168
- Oh, good to see you, you look great.
- You too, honey.

1149
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:17,962
You've been doing other exercise, too?

1150
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:19,880
No, I haven't done exercise
in six months.

1151
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:20,798
Oh, wow.

1152
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,925
So we gotta find a way
to ease back, you know.

1153
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:24,718
- Okay, yeah.
- Take me slowly there.

1154
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:25,802
Definitely.

1155
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:27,429
It's been a long time.

1156
01:19:30,641 --> 01:19:31,641
There you go.

1157
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:37,398
Good, that's good.

1158
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:39,066
- Perfect.
- Can't even budge.

1159
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:47,157
- Good. Turn... Be completely relaxed.
- This is hard, man, Jesus Christ.

1160
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:48,241
Take a break.

1161
01:19:51,662 --> 01:19:53,789
- The body's not used to it, right?
- Yeah.

1162
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,456
Yep.

1163
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:58,502
It's the way to get back like that again.

1164
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:27,573
I'm gonna give you a list right now
of people that I'd like to just get,

1165
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:30,743
and as fast as you get them on the phone,
I have to speak with each one.

1166
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:31,660
No problem.

1167
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,370
- Sidney Poitier.
- Mm-hmm.

1168
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:34,830
Stevie Wonder. Michael.

1169
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:38,667
- M.J.
- Streisand. Spielberg's office.

1170
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:41,128
- And I'd like to talk to Alex Haley.
- Mm-hmm.

1171
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:42,379
And Brando.

1172
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:49,636
<i>The new star
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</i>

1173
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:53,057
<i>This one honors composer, arranger,
and jazz musician Quincy Jones.</i>

1174
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:55,225
How did all these people get here?

1175
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:57,978
<i>Jones was there today
with his wife, actress Peggy Lipton,</i>

1176
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,772
<i>who was, of course, in </i>The Mod Squad.

1177
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:01,940
Jones headed the list
with eight nominations

1178
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:04,860
including best album of the year
for <i>The Dude.</i>

1179
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:09,823
You get inspired by so many things
and you never stop, you never stop.

1180
01:21:09,907 --> 01:21:12,347
You think you can get it all in
and that's the dangerous part.

1181
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:16,622
<i>There was so much demand on him,
in every way.</i>

1182
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:20,876
<i>Host this, be that, you know,
show up here, do that.</i>

1183
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:26,048
<i>I began to find those things
really wearing on us.</i>

1184
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:29,176
<i>It didn't feel like the old days anymore.</i>

1185
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,887
<i>It felt like things had changed so much.</i>

1186
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:34,973
<i>A group of legendary performers
recorded "We Are the World".</i>

1187
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:36,850
That's good, let's put it on the tape!

1188
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:41,146
<i>They've generated millions
of dollars to help fight famine in Africa.</i>

1189
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:44,691
"The world's number one music man."
One would think that's enough.

1190
01:21:44,775 --> 01:21:47,903
What, uh, made you decide
to go and produce a film?

1191
01:21:47,986 --> 01:21:51,448
Well, it's been a little secret dream
for years, right?

1192
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:57,704
And it also encompassed
a beautiful era of black music

1193
01:21:57,788 --> 01:22:00,666
that was woven and integrated
right into the story.

1194
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:09,758
At first I resisted, you know,
for all the obvious reasons.

1195
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:13,262
And Quincy was saying,
"You know, this is not about race.

1196
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:14,471
This is about humanity."

1197
01:22:14,555 --> 01:22:18,058
And he said, "You know, you didn't
have to go to Mars to make <i>E.T."</i>

1198
01:22:18,142 --> 01:22:19,893
And that made a lot of sense to me.

1199
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:27,693
You all know the story, right?
Quincy Jones discovered me.

1200
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:30,779
And he was in Chicago, turned...
Tell 'em the story, Quincy.

1201
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,783
We were trying to cast
<i>The Color Purple.</i>

1202
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,116
I came in on a red-eye

1203
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:36,493
and couldn't sleep
and walked around in the hotel

1204
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:38,245
and turned on the television set,

1205
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:41,331
and here comes Miss Winfrey,

1206
01:22:41,415 --> 01:22:43,250
real, honest, and true,

1207
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:45,461
and it's all over. My baby.

1208
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:47,713
- And I was discovered!
- My baby.

1209
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,971
<i>After principal photography
had been completed,</i>

1210
01:22:56,430 --> 01:22:57,431
<i>I almost forgot</i>

1211
01:22:57,514 --> 01:23:00,392
<i>I still had to create a score
in less than two months.</i>

1212
01:23:00,476 --> 01:23:02,478
- <i>Were you overwhelmed?
- Oh, yes.</i>

1213
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:04,563
<i>And I just panicked, you know?</i>

1214
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:07,107
We already got a drum machine on, man.
We got a drum machine.

1215
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:08,831
We don't need to worry about that, do we?

1216
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:22,915
I know it's a sickness,
in a way.

1217
01:23:23,457 --> 01:23:26,668
You can call it "workaholic"
or whatever it is, but it's, uh...

1218
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:28,378
it's the only way I know.

1219
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:32,424
<i>He'd become...</i>

1220
01:23:32,883 --> 01:23:35,511
<i>a person
that people just wanted a part of,</i>

1221
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:38,347
<i>and he began to give away, I thought...</i>

1222
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:40,641
<i>pieces of himself.</i>

1223
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:44,269
<i>And by the time </i>The Color Purple <i>was over,
there was nothing left.</i>

1224
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:46,688
<i>He wasn't even of this world.</i>

1225
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:50,859
How are you feeling now?
I mean, are you, like, zombied out?

1226
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:53,862
I'm fried, yes, really. It's...
I've been running around,

1227
01:23:53,946 --> 01:23:57,074
and... and I'm just physically
and mentally exhausted, you know?

1228
01:23:57,157 --> 01:23:59,010
- From writing all that music?
- Just everything.

1229
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:01,787
It's just the most music
I've ever seen in my life, and it's...

1230
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,622
The brain is just tired, you know.

1231
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:07,000
It's two years, you know.
Just like... I've been running.

1232
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:11,964
<i>Our relationship was starting to,
you know, look sort of, uh, bleak.</i>

1233
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:15,092
<i>And a lot of it came from my insecurity,</i>

1234
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:17,386
<i>not having him around
as much as I wanted to.</i>

1235
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:21,682
<i>That movie took him away.</i>

1236
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:26,228
<i>He wanted to fix things,
but there was nothing to fix.</i>

1237
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,481
<i>I wasn't that whole... person
that I needed to be.</i>

1238
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:31,525
<i>So...</i>

1239
01:24:32,276 --> 01:24:33,276
<i>we broke up.</i>

1240
01:24:35,028 --> 01:24:36,196
<i>It was over like that.</i>

1241
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:44,079
<i>Losing my marriage to Peggy
after 14 years</i>

1242
01:24:44,162 --> 01:24:46,206
<i>was like having my arteries ripped out.</i>

1243
01:24:47,541 --> 01:24:50,752
<i>I lost the woman I thought I'd live with
for the rest of my life.</i>

1244
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:55,048
<i>I'd known then
that I was losing my mind...</i>

1245
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:58,552
<i>that I was having a nervous breakdown.</i>

1246
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:01,722
<i>I went back...</i>

1247
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:03,890
<i>inside, deep into myself,</i>

1248
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:08,562
<i>to reassess my essence as a human being.</i>

1249
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:14,067
<i>'Cause I don't want to recreate
any of the old patterns again.</i>

1250
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:19,698
<i>I realized that, from the time
I was a little boy, to that moment,</i>

1251
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,617
<i>I was always running...</i>

1252
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:25,704
<i>always trying to fill up
that black hole in my soul.</i>

1253
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:29,833
<i>I ran because there was nothing behind me
to hold me up.</i>

1254
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:33,879
<i>I ran because I thought that
that was all there was to do.</i>

1255
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:38,216
<i>I thought that to stay in one place
meant to die.</i>

1256
01:25:40,427 --> 01:25:42,596
<i>All I could think about was my kids...</i>

1257
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:46,850
<i>how my success had been
at their expense in so many ways.</i>

1258
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:51,355
Sometimes it's hard, at first,
to talk to him.

1259
01:25:51,438 --> 01:25:53,190
- Uh-huh.
- But then, once...

1260
01:25:53,273 --> 01:25:56,360
once I say what I want to say, he's fine.

1261
01:25:57,277 --> 01:26:01,448
Like, I couldn't really talk to him
for a while 'cause I never see him.

1262
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:02,531
Yeah.

1263
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:08,997
<i>It took two or three years
to get everything really in focus,</i>

1264
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:14,044
<i>to reassess
how I want to spend the rest of my life.</i>

1265
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:53,250
Ladies and gentlemen,
the hardest-working man in showbusiness.

1266
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:58,213
Okay... Okay, did you get it?

1267
01:26:58,588 --> 01:27:00,257
Daddy! Daddy!

1268
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:10,350
No! Oh, God...

1269
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:19,735
I thought about my kids because, while
I was doing all this stuff, you know...

1270
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:21,528
uh, it was taking the time from them.

1271
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:23,530
And that's what I kept thinking about,
you know.

1272
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:26,950
And that's my pride and joy,
my children, I'm telling you.

1273
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:28,201
And I'm making up for it now.

1274
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:31,580
This is my one and only number one son.

1275
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:33,790
He loves lots of hip hop

1276
01:27:33,874 --> 01:27:36,960
and introduced me to a lot of things
that I didn't understand about it.

1277
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,304
And again, yep.

1278
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:51,141
That's good.
And look over there.

1279
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:52,224
That's great.

1280
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:55,353
This shit kinda big, huh?

1281
01:27:57,564 --> 01:27:59,065
It's Quincy Jones, boy.

1282
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:01,276
Don't talk to me no more.

1283
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:04,988
Want to make a bad face?

1284
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:11,495
My generation was introduced to Quincy
when<i> Thriller...</i>

1285
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:14,873
You know, that's where...

1286
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:19,127
kids my age can identify him with.

1287
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:21,630
- Where you from, man?
- I'm from Compton.

1288
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:24,674
South Side of Chicago, that was my home.

1289
01:28:24,758 --> 01:28:26,843
- Yeah, it's tough. My family's from there.
- Huh?

1290
01:28:26,927 --> 01:28:28,780
- My whole family's from there.
- That's amazing.

1291
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:31,699
But it's the same. You know, the hood
is the same everywhere in the world.

1292
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,683
- Yeah.
- Then I found a piano, man,

1293
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:35,393
- and that changed my life.
- Yeah.

1294
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:39,185
I would have been dead or in prison
a long time ago.

1295
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:41,191
- Right.
- Chicago, Jesus...

1296
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:42,734
In the '30s?

1297
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:44,378
- Them motherfuckers don't play.
- Yeah.

1298
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:48,240
It's funny, because I was inspired
by <i>Back on the Block </i>without even knowing.

1299
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:53,453
Combining hip hop and jazz,
and you was the first to do it.

1300
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:55,455
- Do you know where rap came from?
- Uhn-uhn.

1301
01:28:55,539 --> 01:28:57,833
Where? Where do you think
it came from, the Bronx?

1302
01:28:57,916 --> 01:29:00,335
- My generation, we're gonna say the Bronx.
- Shit.

1303
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:02,462
- The Bronx.
- It came from Africa.

1304
01:29:02,546 --> 01:29:03,880
The praise-shouters in Africa.

1305
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:06,550
- That's a trip, man.
- It is.

1306
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:08,468
That's where all the rhythms came from.
Huh?

1307
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:10,387
- To know where it really originates.
- Yeah.

1308
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,430
- Where the rhythms came from.
- Vibrations, yeah.

1309
01:29:12,472 --> 01:29:15,892
When I was in the hospital,
I was looking back on 70 years, man.

1310
01:29:15,976 --> 01:29:17,536
- It's been a motherfucker, man.
- Yeah.

1311
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:20,564
Unbelievable.
Each decade is different, you know?

1312
01:29:20,647 --> 01:29:21,982
- Each decade.
- Different music.

1313
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:23,441
- Right.
- It's amazing.

1314
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:25,777
I never thought about
that stuff before, you know.

1315
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:28,446
- 'Cause you get back what you give, man.
- Yeah.

1316
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:30,365
- You can count on that.
- Wow.

1317
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:33,285
- Man.
- But you're on the right track, man.

1318
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:36,246
- It's definitely a pleasure. An honor.
- I'm very proud of you, man.

1319
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:38,290
- Thank you.
- And I'm always there for you.

1320
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:40,542
- You got my card, right?
- Yup. Yup.

1321
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:41,918
- Always there.
- Yup.

1322
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:43,336
- I mean that.
- Yup.

1323
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:45,020
- I'm gonna take that to heart.
- Mm-hmm.

1324
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:46,464
I'm gonna take it to heart.

1325
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:57,893
- So, this is Prairie, huh?
- This is it.

1326
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:09,446
Lord, that's it! Lord have mercy!
Just hold, just a second. God damn.

1327
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:11,990
Wow.

1328
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:15,160
God. Boy, this is heavy... Whoo!

1329
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:22,292
That is unbelievable.

1330
01:30:26,922 --> 01:30:28,340
God damn!

1331
01:30:37,724 --> 01:30:38,975
That's frightening, man.

1332
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:51,905
I can't put it all together.

1333
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:05,293
Man, oh, man.

1334
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:07,629
Look at this, I remember this.

1335
01:31:08,046 --> 01:31:10,423
Ooh! I remember this so well.

1336
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:19,933
Yeah, we were back here.

1337
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:23,937
Oh, my God, man.

1338
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:26,063
Wow.

1339
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:36,324
You know what's amazing is how big
everything used to feel. It's so tiny.

1340
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:42,956
Oh boy, it's my... My parents stayed here.

1341
01:31:48,044 --> 01:31:51,798
That's where they threw my mother
down on the bed and, uh...

1342
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:55,260
and put her in a straitjacket.

1343
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:57,303
And they took her away.

1344
01:32:04,561 --> 01:32:05,603
Jesus Christ.

1345
01:32:21,619 --> 01:32:24,831
I'm carrying around the past.

1346
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:29,794
But you can sit
and wallow in that shit, you know...

1347
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:33,923
and blame, and all the other stuff,
but it's not about that.

1348
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:39,721
At one point, I stopped thinking about
myself and I started to think about her

1349
01:32:39,804 --> 01:32:42,766
and... think about the things
she had gone through.

1350
01:32:43,349 --> 01:32:44,684
And how much she loved us.

1351
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:48,480
And I got it.
It was real late, but I got it, you know.

1352
01:32:50,065 --> 01:32:52,275
You got to let go all of the past,
you know,

1353
01:32:52,358 --> 01:32:54,027
bring the good parts forward,

1354
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:57,238
forget about the negative stuff,
and go on.

1355
01:32:58,114 --> 01:33:01,451
Because whenever you get hung up
and locked into the past,

1356
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:03,620
you're robbing yourself of the present...

1357
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:06,081
and definitely the future, you know.

1358
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:09,084
- How old are you?
- Eight.

1359
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:11,586
I was here when I was your age.

1360
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:14,506
You got Michael Jackson in business.

1361
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:30,647
I was working on the show, man.

1362
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:32,440
It's just right around the corner.

1363
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:35,860
- You think you'll be ready, Dad?
- We'll get it.

1364
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:48,039
Boy, oh boy, what history.

1365
01:33:55,338 --> 01:33:56,338
Oh, my God.

1366
01:33:58,049 --> 01:34:00,552
Boy, the shit they've gone through
in this country.

1367
01:34:05,348 --> 01:34:08,977
This has got to be the best
for young people to see, good God.

1368
01:34:16,568 --> 01:34:18,069
Look at Marvin over there.

1369
01:34:18,444 --> 01:34:19,444
My baby.

1370
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:23,199
Look at this. All the old homies there.

1371
01:34:25,076 --> 01:34:26,411
Yeah, these are the kings.

1372
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:32,584
Mm-mm-mm!

1373
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:34,544
Unbelievable.

1374
01:34:37,463 --> 01:34:39,591
Here's your girl, Dinah Washington.

1375
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:42,594
Look at Dinah, the Queen.

1376
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:46,055
I started with her when I was 22.

1377
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:50,476
It's heavy, man. This is like a dream.

1378
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:55,815
My brother, man.

1379
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:02,404
Smelly.

1380
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:07,951
Heavy.

1381
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:12,790
Lord have mercy, this is memories.

1382
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:14,375
Memory lane, man.

1383
01:35:16,002 --> 01:35:18,755
This is so good for young people,
boy, I can't tell you.

1384
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:20,690
Kids can see what the history is about.

1385
01:35:20,757 --> 01:35:23,152
- Exactly, exactly.
- It's beautiful, man. Thank you, brother.

1386
01:35:23,176 --> 01:35:25,345
Thank you. Been waiting all my life
to see this, man.

1387
01:35:28,264 --> 01:35:29,307
Jesus Christ.

1388
01:35:33,353 --> 01:35:34,353
Damn.

1389
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:36,188
All of them gone.

1390
01:35:38,024 --> 01:35:39,025
That's frightening.

1391
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:48,158
Hmm.

1392
01:35:48,451 --> 01:35:49,452
Beautiful people.

1393
01:35:55,124 --> 01:35:57,252
- Am I in tune?
- That's what I was gonna do.

1394
01:35:57,335 --> 01:35:59,045
Feels a little high.

1395
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:02,382
- Um, sharp or flat?
- It's a little high.

1396
01:36:02,465 --> 01:36:04,926
- A little sharp.
- No shit.

1397
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:09,430
<i>If I had one more shot
to make an album,</i>

1398
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:11,182
<i>it would be an album like this.</i>

1399
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:15,812
Whoa, baby!

1400
01:36:15,895 --> 01:36:17,855
- I'm supposed to keep right through?
- That's it.

1401
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:19,565
You did just what you supposed to do.

1402
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:21,943
- You know, it should be your personality.
- I'll try.

1403
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:24,946
Okay? And that's easy for you to be you.

1404
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:34,956
<i>Working with these artists
that people have loved over the years</i>

1405
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:38,918
<i>like Ella Fitzgerald, and Sarah Vaughan,
and Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie,</i>

1406
01:36:39,002 --> 01:36:39,919
<i>and Ray Charles...</i>

1407
01:36:40,003 --> 01:36:42,755
Now, Q, what do you want...
Okay, guys, where should I go?

1408
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:45,758
Yes, sir!

1409
01:36:50,596 --> 01:36:52,724
Did you say, "I'll take you shopping"?

1410
01:36:52,807 --> 01:36:54,392
Okay, yeah, I mean...

1411
01:36:56,519 --> 01:36:59,314
<i>Along with the rappers,
the new people in the family,</i>

1412
01:36:59,397 --> 01:37:01,316
<i>like Kool Moe Dee and Ice-T,</i>

1413
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:04,485
<i>and Melle Mel and Big Daddy Kane,
it's just been unbelievable.</i>

1414
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:06,654
You've got a real nice message here,

1415
01:37:06,738 --> 01:37:09,458
so try to just make sure all your words
are clear and coming through,

1416
01:37:09,532 --> 01:37:11,092
no matter what feeling you put into it.

1417
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:20,335
<i>And there was a kinship.</i>

1418
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:23,254
<i>There was a strong kinship between
hip hop and bebop, I could feel it.</i>

1419
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:27,633
<i>And that's why I tried the fusion
of the two and it was so natural.</i>

1420
01:37:46,069 --> 01:37:48,071
<i>Back on the Block, </i>Quincy Jones,

1421
01:37:48,154 --> 01:37:50,323
producer Quincy Jones.

1422
01:37:54,744 --> 01:37:55,995
I can't believe this.

1423
01:37:57,038 --> 01:38:00,375
I really can't believe this.
I've been in this Academy since 1958.

1424
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:03,961
And this is the first time
I even dare think about having a...

1425
01:38:06,506 --> 01:38:09,884
Grammy... under my own name,
and I'm so proud.

1426
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:13,679
I'd like to firstly thank my mother.

1427
01:38:14,847 --> 01:38:16,974
To my beautiful children, my family.

1428
01:38:17,058 --> 01:38:19,977
I'd like to ask everyone to pray
for peace on Earth,

1429
01:38:20,061 --> 01:38:22,772
and when we get peace on Earth,
let's take care of the Earth.

1430
01:38:22,855 --> 01:38:24,690
Thank you very much. I'm very happy.

1431
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:29,612
Why did you say that the next decade

1432
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:32,198
is going to be the most difficult
ten years of your life?

1433
01:38:34,826 --> 01:38:38,788
It's when I'll have the energy
to really stand behind all of the things

1434
01:38:38,871 --> 01:38:41,082
that I believe about, creatively...

1435
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:44,168
um, socially, politically,

1436
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:46,212
personally, ethically,
morally, and everything.

1437
01:38:47,004 --> 01:38:52,093
We came here to announce the formation
of Qwest Broadcasting Company.

1438
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:56,055
Qwest will be one of the largest
minority-controlled broadcasting groups

1439
01:38:56,139 --> 01:38:57,390
in the industry today.

1440
01:38:58,015 --> 01:39:01,769
Our first show went on NBC on Monday
nights, <i>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.</i>

1441
01:39:07,066 --> 01:39:09,986
Quincy called me.
He said, "What are you doing?"

1442
01:39:10,069 --> 01:39:12,363
I said. "Well, you know, we're touring."
He said, "Okay.

1443
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:14,699
Well, I want to pitch your future to you."

1444
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:16,701
- Hey, Q!
- Hey!

1445
01:39:18,411 --> 01:39:20,611
<i>I saw him
from the first time he got on camera,</i>

1446
01:39:20,663 --> 01:39:23,374
<i>and I saw this man grow and grow.</i>

1447
01:39:23,458 --> 01:39:26,836
Vibe <i>is
the latest thrill for Quincy Jones,</i>

1448
01:39:26,919 --> 01:39:30,089
<i>who says his new magazine
will be for the '90s hip hoppers</i>

1449
01:39:30,173 --> 01:39:32,884
<i>what </i>Rolling Stone <i>was to '60s rockers.</i>

1450
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:35,678
I realized there's a whole
new music culture

1451
01:39:35,761 --> 01:39:39,432
that sits on the scene today
that I think is growing by the minute

1452
01:39:39,515 --> 01:39:41,142
and there's no voice for it.

1453
01:39:47,523 --> 01:39:50,902
<i>What is it about rap
that scares people?</i>

1454
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:54,489
<i>It's young black urban males
with a lot of energy</i>

1455
01:39:54,614 --> 01:39:58,242
<i>and expressing the conditions
of their life in a very poetic way.</i>

1456
01:39:58,326 --> 01:40:00,703
<i>It's a very dramatic way,
a very theatrical way,</i>

1457
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,663
<i>and it is very powerful stuff.</i>

1458
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:06,276
<i>The two have been
at the center of a battle</i>

1459
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:08,377
<i>between east and west coast rappers.</i>

1460
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:12,340
<i>I don't think they are aware
that they have such a tremendous heritage.</i>

1461
01:40:12,757 --> 01:40:16,177
<i>Sometimes they feel like they're alone
out there. But they're not alone.</i>

1462
01:40:17,762 --> 01:40:21,432
<i>Fans on both coasts
want the real-life violence to stop.</i>

1463
01:40:22,016 --> 01:40:25,061
I think communications can help a lot,

1464
01:40:25,144 --> 01:40:28,397
because we're getting ready to lose
two generations of young people.

1465
01:40:32,026 --> 01:40:36,405
<i>We had a symposium, uh,
in New York with Suge Knight,</i>

1466
01:40:36,489 --> 01:40:39,116
<i>and Dr. Dre, and Puffy,
and all those people,</i>

1467
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,952
<i>Public Enemy, and Colin Powell,</i>

1468
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:44,247
<i>you know, to talk about
how do we even this out</i>

1469
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:46,457
<i>so that they don't get blown away
so young.</i>

1470
01:40:46,916 --> 01:40:49,752
Let's bring Quincy Jones up
so he can really set it off.

1471
01:40:53,130 --> 01:40:56,968
The reason I fell in love with hip hop?
Because it reminded me so much of bebop,

1472
01:40:57,051 --> 01:41:00,596
and I feel a kinship there because we went
through a lot of the same stuff.

1473
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:02,515
The philosophy behind bebop

1474
01:41:02,598 --> 01:41:05,226
is that you had to be hip,
you wanted to be hip.

1475
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:07,019
And being hip is being aware.

1476
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:12,275
The thing that really provoked me to say
it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.

1477
01:41:12,358 --> 01:41:15,361
We finally hooked up,
even though it was, uh...

1478
01:41:15,444 --> 01:41:18,656
tension conditions in the beginning,
we finally talked to each other

1479
01:41:18,739 --> 01:41:21,409
and he said nobody had talked
to him like that before.

1480
01:41:22,535 --> 01:41:24,453
And I said I can't take it anymore...

1481
01:41:24,537 --> 01:41:28,332
because we no longer
can afford to be non-political,

1482
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:30,209
and I'm talking to the hip hop nation now.

1483
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:35,047
We got to seriously talk about
what you are you going to... deal with.

1484
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:38,551
They're not playing. There's real bullets
out there, believe me.

1485
01:41:40,052 --> 01:41:43,264
I'm not gonna roll on here.
I got so many things to say...

1486
01:41:44,307 --> 01:41:46,767
and it's a very emotional... thing.

1487
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:49,228
I want to see you guys live
at least to my age.

1488
01:41:49,312 --> 01:41:50,312
I really do.

1489
01:41:54,317 --> 01:41:57,528
<i>Rapper Biggie Smalls
was shot to death in Los Angeles.</i>

1490
01:41:57,612 --> 01:42:00,239
<i>His death comes almost exactly
six months to the day</i>

1491
01:42:00,323 --> 01:42:04,493
<i>that another rapper, Tupac Shakur,
was fatally shot in Las Vegas.</i>

1492
01:42:05,911 --> 01:42:08,789
His death is going
to open some eyes most definitely.

1493
01:42:08,873 --> 01:42:12,209
To me, I get the feeling that there's
already becoming a change in hip hop.

1494
01:42:12,293 --> 01:42:15,463
Everybody's moving more
to the positive vibe.

1495
01:42:15,546 --> 01:42:16,631
You know what I mean?

1496
01:42:39,362 --> 01:42:41,489
I've seen the power of music as a tool...

1497
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:45,660
to reach the hearts and minds
of millions of people.

1498
01:42:46,077 --> 01:42:50,373
And since my voice carries louder
and farther than those of a few others,

1499
01:42:50,456 --> 01:42:53,376
I have a special responsibility
to sing a melody...

1500
01:42:53,918 --> 01:42:56,128
about poverty eradication,

1501
01:42:56,212 --> 01:42:59,465
to end the suffering
caused by extreme poverty.

1502
01:42:59,882 --> 01:43:02,051
And I have been hungry.
I know what it feels like.

1503
01:43:02,134 --> 01:43:04,762
And I don't care how much money I make
or suits I wear,

1504
01:43:04,845 --> 01:43:08,557
I never forget that feeling of what
it feels like when you miss the meals

1505
01:43:08,641 --> 01:43:10,351
and you can't eat for three days.

1506
01:43:11,644 --> 01:43:15,856
<i>When Quincy decided that he wanted to be
more of a citizen with more impact,</i>

1507
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:18,609
<i>not only in the United States,
but around the world,</i>

1508
01:43:18,693 --> 01:43:21,445
<i>he goes after that
the same way he went after music.</i>

1509
01:43:21,862 --> 01:43:23,406
Hi, I'm Quincy Jones,

1510
01:43:23,614 --> 01:43:25,866
and this is the first official
opening ceremony

1511
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:27,868
leading to the presidential inauguration.

1512
01:43:28,619 --> 01:43:30,413
- Hey, Rash!
- Busy, Dad?

1513
01:43:30,496 --> 01:43:32,248
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

1514
01:43:32,998 --> 01:43:35,185
<i>He understands
that it's only through politics</i>

1515
01:43:35,209 --> 01:43:38,713
<i>that you can address some of the problems
that he cares a lot about.</i>

1516
01:43:39,338 --> 01:43:42,633
<i>Now Jones will gather
many of the world's A-list stars in Rome</i>

1517
01:43:42,717 --> 01:43:44,802
<i>for the "We Are the Future" concert.</i>

1518
01:43:44,885 --> 01:43:46,303
<i>Ciao, Roma!</i>

1519
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:49,432
<i>The event will launch
a worldwide humanitarian effort</i>

1520
01:43:49,515 --> 01:43:52,143
<i>aimed at helping children
in war-ravaged countries.</i>

1521
01:43:52,685 --> 01:43:55,165
<i>Pope John Paul II
meets with Quincy Jones today</i>

1522
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:57,606
<i>as part of an effort
to help get rid of Third World debt.</i>

1523
01:43:58,441 --> 01:44:02,903
We're raising the funds now
to build 100 homes in South Africa

1524
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:05,281
with the Habitat for Humanity.

1525
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:07,074
My daddy used to do this, man.

1526
01:44:08,325 --> 01:44:11,370
<i>I've got a great respect
for Quincy Jones.</i>

1527
01:44:11,996 --> 01:44:14,915
<i>For a man with such talents</i>

1528
01:44:14,999 --> 01:44:17,960
<i>to regard the struggle in South Africa...</i>

1529
01:44:18,043 --> 01:44:21,422
<i>This takes an exceptional human being.</i>

1530
01:44:22,465 --> 01:44:24,467
<i>What's interesting about Quincy
has been,</i>

1531
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:28,888
<i>at each stage in this remarkable career,
he's been the first.</i>

1532
01:44:29,472 --> 01:44:32,975
<i>He's been somebody who's walked
through that door before anybody else has,</i>

1533
01:44:33,434 --> 01:44:37,938
<i>and that's given people behind him
enormous confidence.</i>

1534
01:44:38,022 --> 01:44:40,232
<i>And he's done it with grace.</i>

1535
01:44:41,484 --> 01:44:44,236
- You only live 26,000 days.
- That's right.

1536
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,631
- And you dead a lot longer than that.
- That's right, honey.

1537
01:44:46,655 --> 01:44:48,855
And so, I'm telling you,
I'm gonna wear all of them out.

1538
01:44:48,908 --> 01:44:51,494
And if I get to 80, that'll be 29,000.

1539
01:44:51,577 --> 01:44:53,204
I'm gonna wear 'em all out, you know?

1540
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:56,081
They're gonna know...
we came through here.

1541
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:05,800
It's from a...

1542
01:45:06,425 --> 01:45:09,178
a farm down in South Africa,

1543
01:45:09,261 --> 01:45:11,597
and they were going broke
with the produce,

1544
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:14,350
so the owner of the farm
taught all the people that worked on it

1545
01:45:14,433 --> 01:45:15,559
how to do sculpting.

1546
01:45:16,519 --> 01:45:17,603
Isn't that something?

1547
01:45:17,937 --> 01:45:19,897
So I was at this art gallery...

1548
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:22,942
with Mancini,
and I saw the dude that said,

1549
01:45:23,025 --> 01:45:24,693
"Take me with you, take me home."

1550
01:45:25,486 --> 01:45:27,696
You know, he just begged me
to take him home.

1551
01:45:28,823 --> 01:45:31,784
That's what inspired the album.
Isn't that something?

1552
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:33,910
That's the dude.

1553
01:45:36,121 --> 01:45:37,540
Attitude, isn't it, man?

1554
01:45:38,833 --> 01:45:40,584
Is that attitude? Shit...!

1555
01:45:41,043 --> 01:45:42,563
Don't mess with that motherfucker,
boy.

1556
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:44,964
And it just talked to me every night.

1557
01:45:45,464 --> 01:45:48,509
"Hey, motherfucker, I want to be an album.
I want to be a tune."

1558
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:53,931
Merry Christmas.

1559
01:45:59,436 --> 01:46:00,479
This is my grandson.

1560
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:01,814
Love you, man.

1561
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:03,440
- Merry Christmas.
- You too, baby.

1562
01:46:03,524 --> 01:46:04,859
I adore you.

1563
01:46:07,111 --> 01:46:08,237
Yeah, baby!

1564
01:46:14,743 --> 01:46:15,828
Where's my kiss?

1565
01:46:18,414 --> 01:46:19,665
Thank you, sweetheart.

1566
01:46:19,748 --> 01:46:20,875
Oh!

1567
01:46:22,835 --> 01:46:25,504
- I love your class.
- Can you take a picture with us?

1568
01:46:25,588 --> 01:46:27,006
Thanks for tonight, Glo.

1569
01:46:28,924 --> 01:46:29,925
It was great.

1570
01:46:35,514 --> 01:46:39,101
When you almost leave here,
you really treasure a day like today.

1571
01:46:39,184 --> 01:46:40,185
Oh, man.

1572
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:42,521
Really treasure it.

1573
01:46:46,734 --> 01:46:48,611
Every... every day, friends are dying.

1574
01:46:49,445 --> 01:46:50,654
It's really been crazy.

1575
01:46:51,614 --> 01:46:55,826
It's hard because, you know what,
you know that that telephone

1576
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:57,453
will never be answered again.

1577
01:46:58,037 --> 01:47:00,789
Ray Charles, all those people,
it'll never be answered again,

1578
01:47:00,873 --> 01:47:02,124
and that's the hard part.

1579
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:04,811
You've got their numbers,
the Cannonball's and stuff,

1580
01:47:04,835 --> 01:47:07,546
Dizzy's and Miles', and Sarah, and Ella,
and all that stuff,

1581
01:47:07,630 --> 01:47:09,548
but they're... they're gone, you know.

1582
01:47:09,632 --> 01:47:10,799
And it's painful.

1583
01:47:11,342 --> 01:47:12,342
Painful, man.

1584
01:47:12,968 --> 01:47:15,012
Lesley Gore, and Michael.

1585
01:47:15,888 --> 01:47:16,888
It's a killer.

1586
01:47:21,977 --> 01:47:23,103
But that's life.

1587
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:31,987
Hey, Quincy.

1588
01:47:34,823 --> 01:47:35,866
This is me.

1589
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:38,494
You know what?

1590
01:48:58,407 --> 01:48:59,533
Aww, Quincy...

1591
01:49:01,535 --> 01:49:03,787
I love you, man. I love you.

1592
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:21,972
Today, as so many generations have before,
we gather on our National Mall...

1593
01:49:23,515 --> 01:49:27,311
to tell an essential part
of our American story.

1594
01:49:29,438 --> 01:49:31,940
One that has, at times, been overlooked.

1595
01:49:37,446 --> 01:49:39,490
Quincy is the reason
we're all here.

1596
01:49:39,573 --> 01:49:41,992
He suggested
that we all get involved in this.

1597
01:49:43,035 --> 01:49:44,078
Thank you.

1598
01:49:45,746 --> 01:49:47,164
You know what would be a good idea?

1599
01:49:47,247 --> 01:49:49,416
So if you're doing a live
"America the Beautiful",

1600
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:52,586
you ought to play Ray Charles'
"America the Beautiful" in there too.

1601
01:49:52,669 --> 01:49:54,546
- The combination would be hot.
- Yeah.

1602
01:49:55,380 --> 01:49:57,260
As soon as you get the script,
just send it him.

1603
01:49:57,299 --> 01:50:00,761
Maybe we'll let him use his own words
about how happy he is to see the museum.

1604
01:50:01,261 --> 01:50:03,781
"African-Americans came from Carolinas,
Florida, New Orleans..."

1605
01:50:03,847 --> 01:50:07,184
Just cut that out and start,
"A lot of whites came from Downtown."

1606
01:50:07,267 --> 01:50:09,812
- We didn't get Colin Powell yet, huh?
- Huh?

1607
01:50:09,895 --> 01:50:12,176
- Didn't get Colin Powell?
- Don't think they got him yet.

1608
01:50:13,482 --> 01:50:15,275
Okay, I'll call Colin, man, I'll call him.

1609
01:50:16,318 --> 01:50:18,445
My brother, Colin, this is Quincy, man.

1610
01:50:18,904 --> 01:50:19,904
Yeah.

1611
01:50:20,739 --> 01:50:22,116
But we need you, man.

1612
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:24,618
And Tom Hanks will introduce you,
you know,

1613
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:26,954
right after they do the Tuskegee Airmen.

1614
01:50:28,413 --> 01:50:30,165
All right, Colin, I love you, man.

1615
01:50:30,666 --> 01:50:31,666
Done.

1616
01:50:32,209 --> 01:50:33,209
Colin Powell.

1617
01:50:36,421 --> 01:50:37,421
We got him.

1618
01:50:38,882 --> 01:50:39,883
And Jada.

1619
01:50:47,141 --> 01:50:50,060
So, did you hear back from her yet?
Oprah?

1620
01:50:50,144 --> 01:50:51,412
- Just from the assistant.
- Okay.

1621
01:50:51,436 --> 01:50:52,771
She was passing it along.

1622
01:50:52,855 --> 01:50:56,233
Okay, thank you, we'll begin
this rehearsal just as we did before.

1623
01:51:10,414 --> 01:51:12,916
Killed it, man. What a beautiful feeling.

1624
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:16,753
Don, would you mind putting Chick Webb
before Ella Fitzgerald?

1625
01:51:16,837 --> 01:51:18,422
- Okay, okay.
- Great stuff, baby.

1626
01:51:28,849 --> 01:51:30,225
- Got Oprah.
- Okay.

1627
01:51:30,976 --> 01:51:32,269
I can't wait to see ya.

1628
01:51:32,811 --> 01:51:36,231
You're going to have a ball, honey.
You're gonna have a ball. I love you.

1629
01:51:42,613 --> 01:51:43,488
Yeah, baby!

1630
01:51:44,615 --> 01:51:45,615
Hell, yeah.

1631
01:51:58,003 --> 01:52:00,297
- You guys are so good, honey!
- Thank you!

1632
01:52:00,380 --> 01:52:02,299
- Thank you!
- So good, honey!

1633
01:52:02,382 --> 01:52:03,902
- Thank you so much!
- Thank <i>you,</i> honey.

1634
01:52:03,926 --> 01:52:06,470
- For just being being on this planet.
- No, you!

1635
01:52:06,553 --> 01:52:08,639
- God bless you, honey.
- You are so inspirational.

1636
01:52:08,722 --> 01:52:10,349
I feel your soul and your minds.

1637
01:52:10,891 --> 01:52:13,101
- You guys singing those thirds, I love it.
- Thank you!

1638
01:52:13,185 --> 01:52:14,621
- You do your own arrangements?
- Yes.

1639
01:52:14,645 --> 01:52:15,771
Go on, girl!

1640
01:52:16,939 --> 01:52:18,941
- Love it. Solos and harmony.
- That means so much.

1641
01:52:19,024 --> 01:52:21,318
No, honey, I mean it.
I'm too old to be full of it.

1642
01:52:22,945 --> 01:52:24,196
So exciting, man.

1643
01:52:24,529 --> 01:52:26,573
They're killin' it. Thanks, Don.

1644
01:52:30,202 --> 01:52:31,745
That's Quincy Jones!

1645
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:35,290
"Hardcore."

1646
01:52:35,374 --> 01:52:37,960
We came all the way
from North Carolina for this!

1647
01:52:38,043 --> 01:52:39,544
- Really?
- Thank you!

1648
01:52:39,628 --> 01:52:40,629
God bless you.

1649
01:52:45,842 --> 01:52:46,842
Me, too.

1650
01:52:47,094 --> 01:52:48,094
Love the band!

1651
01:52:49,346 --> 01:52:51,306
Tennessee State, man.
They're incredible, man.

1652
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:53,475
Hey, baby. How you doing?

1653
01:52:53,558 --> 01:52:54,393
Hi.

1654
01:52:54,476 --> 01:52:56,144
I know, Dad, I can't wait.

1655
01:52:56,228 --> 01:52:59,564
You look so good, Daddy!
You look so sharp.

1656
01:53:02,442 --> 01:53:03,442
Hey, girl!

1657
01:53:04,111 --> 01:53:06,947
Hey, Mary. God bless you, honey.
I'm so glad you're here.

1658
01:53:07,447 --> 01:53:08,847
- Thanks for having me.
- Thank <i>you.</i>

1659
01:53:08,907 --> 01:53:12,577
- We're gonna have a fun show.
- Oh, baby, it's a killer, man. Killer!

1660
01:53:12,661 --> 01:53:14,246
- How are you, buddy?
- Good to see you.

1661
01:53:14,329 --> 01:53:15,809
- Yeah, you kicked it, man.
- Oh, man.

1662
01:53:15,872 --> 01:53:17,374
It was fun last night, wasn't it?

1663
01:53:17,457 --> 01:53:19,793
- Hey, Tom. How you doin', brother?
- Good to see you!

1664
01:53:19,876 --> 01:53:21,396
- You too, man!
- How you doin', my man?

1665
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:22,462
You're looking fantastic!

1666
01:53:22,546 --> 01:53:25,090
- I stopped drinking 19 months ago.
- Did you really?

1667
01:53:25,173 --> 01:53:27,676
Well, your life
is totally different, then.

1668
01:53:27,759 --> 01:53:29,261
How you sleeping? All good?

1669
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:30,637
- Incredible.
- Beautiful.

1670
01:53:30,721 --> 01:53:33,307
- So happy you're here, man.
- I'm here, ready to do the thing.

1671
01:53:33,390 --> 01:53:35,309
- You called and I came, man.
- Love you, man.

1672
01:53:36,018 --> 01:53:37,811
Hey, baby! How you doing, man?

1673
01:53:37,894 --> 01:53:39,313
So proud of you, man.

1674
01:53:39,396 --> 01:53:41,606
Whoa!

1675
01:53:42,482 --> 01:53:44,402
- All right. I came to play.
- All right.

1676
01:53:44,985 --> 01:53:45,819
On my way.

1677
01:53:47,195 --> 01:53:48,447
Heads up, five minute warning.

1678
01:53:48,947 --> 01:53:50,407
Want to practice once?

1679
01:53:50,490 --> 01:53:53,827
"It was the happening place.
We called it the Uptown Getdown."

1680
01:53:53,910 --> 01:53:55,120
- That's good.
- That's better.

1681
01:53:55,787 --> 01:53:59,541
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States,</i>

1682
01:53:59,624 --> 01:54:02,377
<i>Barack Obama,
and Mrs. Michelle Obama.</i>

1683
01:54:05,339 --> 01:54:06,339
Voilà!

1684
01:54:06,923 --> 01:54:07,966
Now we're talking.

1685
01:54:11,053 --> 01:54:13,305
We're here to celebrate, and laugh,
and clap along,

1686
01:54:13,388 --> 01:54:15,349
and probably even cry a little

1687
01:54:15,432 --> 01:54:19,102
to mark the opening
of the first museum in the country

1688
01:54:19,186 --> 01:54:25,609
dedicated to the African-American
experience in America!

1689
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:34,534
A father who always gets
the music started, as he will tonight.

1690
01:54:34,618 --> 01:54:35,869
Quincy Jones!

1691
01:54:35,952 --> 01:54:38,580
And his daughter, Rashida Jones!

1692
01:54:51,343 --> 01:54:52,219
How are y'all?

1693
01:54:52,302 --> 01:54:54,262
Yeah!

1694
01:54:54,346 --> 01:54:56,264
So, let me just set the scene for you.

1695
01:54:56,973 --> 01:54:59,643
Harlem, in the '20s and '30s,

1696
01:54:59,726 --> 01:55:02,187
not just an address, but a state of mind.

1697
01:55:25,919 --> 01:55:29,131
Ladies and gentlemen,
six surviving members

1698
01:55:29,214 --> 01:55:30,715
of the Tuskegee Airmen.

1699
01:56:06,042 --> 01:56:07,586
Up there is the first black President.

1700
01:56:27,147 --> 01:56:28,857
- Great, honey.
- You did great, Dad.

1701
01:56:39,659 --> 01:56:40,659
Killer!

1702
01:56:40,702 --> 01:56:41,828
Thank you.

1703
01:56:41,912 --> 01:56:44,498
God bless you. Y'all are bad, baby.

1704
01:56:45,999 --> 01:56:46,999
Yeah.

1705
01:56:47,042 --> 01:56:50,086
I have to thank you, man,
from the bottom of my heart, man.

1706
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:52,510
- God bless you, man.
- God bless you.

1707
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:55,717
- What an experience.
- Keep on keepin' on.

1708
01:56:56,968 --> 01:56:58,553
- Q!
- Thank you.

1709
01:56:58,637 --> 01:56:59,637
You kill me, baby!

1710
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:00,680
What a night.

1711
01:57:00,764 --> 01:57:02,182
- God bless.
- God bless.

1712
01:57:02,933 --> 01:57:03,933
Thank you.

1713
01:57:04,434 --> 01:57:05,352
God bless, honey.

1714
01:57:05,435 --> 01:57:07,062
- How was it?
- Oh, I cried, honey.

1715
01:57:07,145 --> 01:57:08,396
- Oh, you did?
- Yeah.

1716
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:09,481
God bless, baby.

1717
01:57:13,527 --> 01:57:14,527
God damn.

1718
01:57:19,824 --> 01:57:20,909
That's big stuff, man.

1719
01:57:20,992 --> 01:57:24,788
It's a big... responsibility
in this generation, you know.

1720
01:57:24,871 --> 01:57:26,164
"Here's what happened."

1721
01:57:29,793 --> 01:57:33,129
It's a journey, coming up in this fucking
country, man. Chicago...

1722
01:57:37,217 --> 01:57:38,217
No joke.

1723
01:57:38,510 --> 01:57:41,054
I didn't see anybody white
till I was 11 years old.

1724
01:57:42,389 --> 01:57:44,391
And the kids, the kids' minds...

1725
01:57:45,183 --> 01:57:46,184
most of them...

1726
01:57:46,268 --> 01:57:49,563
are not into that shit,
'cause you have to be taught how to hate.

1727
01:57:50,105 --> 01:57:52,440
That's not natural,
to hate somebody because of their skin.

1728
01:57:52,524 --> 01:57:54,192
You don't have nothing to do with that.

1729
01:57:54,276 --> 01:57:56,861
So how people can judge somebody
by the color of their skin

1730
01:57:56,945 --> 01:57:58,196
is fucked up, you know?

1731
01:58:02,659 --> 01:58:06,413
But I... I have a feeling
that God will prevail,

1732
01:58:06,913 --> 01:58:09,040
and... the light will prevail.

1733
01:58:09,374 --> 01:58:10,875
You have to think like that.

1734
01:58:12,335 --> 01:58:15,338
'Cause we've come a long way,
but we've got a long way to go.

1735
01:59:13,813 --> 01:59:15,899
Is there anything you think
you tried to do

1736
01:59:15,982 --> 01:59:17,359
that you didn't succeed at?

1737
01:59:20,278 --> 01:59:21,279
Marriage.
