1
00:00:21,317 --> 00:00:25,874
In the 14th year of the Kyoho era,
under rule of the 8th Shogun Yoshimune,

2
00:00:27,076 --> 00:00:29,486
in Saga Castle on Kyushu island, which
controls a territory of 370,000 koku,

3
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,889
Lord Nabeshima Tango-no-kami governed.

4
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:36,607
In those times a very mysterious
and improbable story occurred.

5
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,725
It is called...

00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:46,261

- Hanazaemon.
- Yes.

23
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:14,559
Mr. Mataichirou.

24
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,338
Well, well. Is this Mr. Hanazaemon?

25
00:02:18,812 --> 00:02:20,630
- The Master has arrived.
- What? The Master?

26
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:32,053
The Master was not coming here,
he arrived unexpectedly.

27
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:37,128
Yes, I decided to leave for a walk.
But now I would like to drink some tea.

28
00:02:37,713 --> 00:02:39,657
Certainly. Sayo!

29
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,151
- Mataichirou!
- Yes?

30
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:58,698
I have not seen her for long time,
she has grown more beautiful since then.

31
00:02:59,536 --> 00:03:00,484
What?

32
00:03:03,694 --> 00:03:07,488
Do you say so about my younger sister?
Thank you.

33
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:19,332
Listen, Sayo!

34
00:03:20,882 --> 00:03:23,976
I did not expect the Master to arrive

35
00:03:24,096 --> 00:03:25,114
during today's outdoor tea ceremony.

36
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:28,213
Really, I was surprised as well.

37
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:32,640
But it seems to me he was satisfied...

38
00:03:33,707 --> 00:03:35,083
And that is the most important thing.

39
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:37,960
Sir, Mr. Komori has arrived.

40
00:03:39,024 --> 00:03:40,526
What? Mr. Hanazaemon?

41
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:50,257
Mr. Mataichirou, forgive me for
visiting at such a late hour.

42
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:53,728
Don't mention it. Welcome.

43
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,704
- Please, come in.
- Excuse me.

44
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,203
Please...

45
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:13,567
Miss Sayo.
Could you leave us alone?

46
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:15,575
Yes.

47
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:34,791
It is strange for the Master to
have arrived so late.

48
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,127
Well, the Master demonstrated his
bad inclinations again.

49
00:04:46,257 --> 00:04:47,727
Brother, what about the Master?

50
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:51,545
He sent the Chief of Servants Komori
with a mission to Ryuuzouji's house.

51
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:53,379
To Ryuuzouji's house?

52
00:04:54,446 --> 00:04:57,877
He wants to take Sayo, Mataichirou's
younger sister, as his concubine.

53
00:04:58,889 --> 00:04:59,869
Really...

54
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:05,507
If the Master has gotten something into
his head, it's impossible to stop him.

55
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,902
All right. If Sayo comes to the castle,

56
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:15,514
I will send her away within three days.

57
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:18,139
I think these are all intrigues
plotted by Mataichirou.

58
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,502
You see, his ancestors governed
this castle in former times,

59
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:25,166
and he is unsatisfied with his allowance
of 3,000 koku. He wants power as well.

60
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,383
In any case, Mataichirou
will always interfere.

61
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:31,758
But if so, I will send away
both him and his sister.

62
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:36,632
If I declare this proposal off,
you will not carry out your mission.

63
00:05:37,929 --> 00:05:40,237
And then your position...

64
00:05:41,036 --> 00:05:42,854
My position doesn't matter.

65
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,201
The only thing which matters is: what
do you and Miss Sayo think about it.

66
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:48,355
But Sir...

67
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:56,878
You and I are childhood friends,
that is why they sent you.

68
00:05:57,447 --> 00:06:01,605
Mataichirou!
I am sure, there is no reason to worry.

69
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:11,064
Four generations ago, the Ryuuzouji
family governed in Saga castle.

70
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:18,162
But my ancestor was dismissed
because of some insignificant fault.

71
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:22,224
His Main Vassal Nabeshima
took his place.

72
00:06:25,307 --> 00:06:30,927
And until the present day, we get an
allowance of 3,000 koku as sufferance.

73
00:06:32,094 --> 00:06:35,303
However, Mr. Hanazaemon,
although we are ruined,

74
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:39,114
I will never allow my younger sister
to become a concubine.

75
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:41,643
Your words are justly spoken.

76
00:06:43,438 --> 00:06:47,344
Please tell them, that
my younger sister Sayo

77
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:53,376
is very awkward, and unfit
to be a concubine of the Master.

78
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:58,054
I understand everything,
so I will tell them.

79
00:06:59,872 --> 00:07:01,011
Thank you.

80
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:19,117
Wait.

81
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,346
What did Ryuuzouji answer?

82
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:25,749
- I will tell the Master in person.
- Tell me.

83
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:28,348
I will tell the Master.

84
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:33,945
- What? Mataichirou refused?
- Yes.

85
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:36,301
What impudence!

86
00:07:37,298 --> 00:07:39,085
He has delusions of grandeur!

87
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:45,646
I think, he cannot forget,

88
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:49,606
that Ryuuzouji governed here in
former days, rather than Nabeshima.

89
00:07:50,206 --> 00:07:53,574
Former days don't matter!
Call Mataichirou immediately!

90
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,890
It is necessary to tell him
he oversteps his position!

91
00:07:58,138 --> 00:08:01,048
This evening Mataichirou should arrive
at the castle for the party of Go.

92
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:04,617
You will be able to discuss it
with him during the game.

93
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:12,872
- Is it raining?
- Yes.

94
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:15,876
It began falling several minutes ago.

95
00:08:17,045 --> 00:08:19,148
Tama has disappeared somewhere.

96
00:08:20,128 --> 00:08:21,930
Really? What is wrong with her?

97
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,480
Usually she doesn't move a
single step from your side.

98
00:08:38,444 --> 00:08:39,519
Brother...

99
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,168
You are upset, aren't you?

100
00:08:44,152 --> 00:08:45,243
Never mind.

101
00:08:45,986 --> 00:08:46,934
Sir...

102
00:08:48,405 --> 00:08:50,760
the palanquin has arrived
for you from the castle.

103
00:08:52,641 --> 00:08:54,222
It seems to me,
it is better to decline today.

104
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:00,643
No, I will go.

105
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,105
This...

106
00:09:05,987 --> 00:09:07,077
This is because of me.

107
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,429
Oh? Do you know already?

108
00:09:13,682 --> 00:09:15,406
Don't worry.

109
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,817
I have already sent my refusal
to the Master through Mr. Komori.

110
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:26,455
- Well, Sayo...
- Yes?

111
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,511
We get from the Master an
allowance of 3,000 koku,

112
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:33,420
I start to feel myself somehow
uncomfortable recently.

113
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:40,680
Well, I will refuse,
and we will be able to leave Saga.

114
00:09:42,735 --> 00:09:45,833
But let us discuss it after my return.

115
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:56,215
Tama!

116
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:06,919
Why are you here?
Well, come on, come outside now then.

117
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:10,476
Come outside!

118
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:17,777
What's happening? You understand that
you cannot go to the castle with me.

119
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:20,900
Well, come outside now then.
Ouch! That hurt!

120
00:10:23,811 --> 00:10:26,293
Why do you disobey this evening?

121
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:28,317
Sayo!

122
00:10:29,123 --> 00:10:31,107
Yes. Well, Tama. Come out of there!

123
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:33,570
Maybe, she fell ill?

124
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:35,736
Take care of her.

125
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:37,655
- Yes.
- Good kitty.

126
00:10:38,619 --> 00:10:43,299
Well, stay at home quietly. Is it OK?
Good, good kitty.

127
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,466
Ti, 12.

128
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:10,595
I, 16.

129
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:13,757
Ri, 16.

130
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:21,840
To, 16.

131
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,609
Tama! Tama!

132
00:11:57,937 --> 00:11:59,059
E, 16.

133
00:12:00,885 --> 00:12:02,276
Re, 10.

134
00:12:06,316 --> 00:12:09,415
Yes, it's a dangerous
situation, Mataichirou.

135
00:12:11,518 --> 00:12:15,367
- Call off your decision.
- Do you mean about the stone?

136
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:18,351
I mean about Sayo.

137
00:12:19,107 --> 00:12:22,807
If you are speaking of that request,
which Mr. Komori communicated,

138
00:12:23,502 --> 00:12:26,554
my sister is very awkward.

139
00:12:27,328 --> 00:12:29,321
She absolutely does not match you.

140
00:12:32,338 --> 00:12:34,962
But if I insist on having my way?

141
00:12:35,697 --> 00:12:37,595
Please, excuse me.

142
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:42,874
Your move.

143
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,348
Re, 11.

144
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:51,368
Ta, 11.

145
00:12:53,913 --> 00:12:56,767
Wait! Wait, do not move thus.

146
00:12:57,557 --> 00:13:00,103
- No.
- Do you refuse to replay?

147
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,175
It was your saying, was it not:

148
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:05,958
"Game on the board -

149
00:13:06,448 --> 00:13:08,835
is alike with the duel of swords."

150
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:27,092
Well, well,
let's not discuss it further.

151
00:13:28,436 --> 00:13:30,997
- Re, 8 then.
- Re, 8?

152
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:34,673
- Please, wait.
- Wait? Wait for what?

153
00:13:35,575 --> 00:13:37,978
Mataichirou, what did you say just now?

154
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:41,330
- "Game on the board..."
- No, I'm not talking about that.

155
00:13:42,681 --> 00:13:43,677
To Re, 8...

156
00:13:44,732 --> 00:13:48,004
I made my 20th move.

157
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:52,205
- You are mistaken!
- No, I am sure!

158
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:54,381
- And I confirm, you are mistaken.
- No, I am not.

159
00:13:56,786 --> 00:14:02,810
Mr. Gyoubu, please, return a white stone
to its place, where it was earlier.

160
00:14:03,838 --> 00:14:07,593
Mr. Mataichirou, are you asserting
that I removed a stone intentionally?

161
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:12,451
No, probably you simply forgot to
place it, when I called my move.

162
00:14:12,571 --> 00:14:14,747
- Stop these accusations!
- Accusations?

163
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:19,276
Mataichirou, we were kind with you
because you are blind.

164
00:14:20,383 --> 00:14:22,755
But you imagined about yourself heaven
knows what, and came on a bit strong.

165
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:27,245
- Master, I have just said the truth.
- Do you still dare to argue?

166
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:30,818
You have to play Go with a pure soul.

167
00:14:31,489 --> 00:14:34,888
One can see your nature on the board
in its true appearance always.

168
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:41,547
Mataichirou, you dare to assert,
that I played unfairly?

169
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:48,586
Master, in aspiring to victory, you
have commited an unsuitable deed.

170
00:14:49,793 --> 00:14:55,271
Do you disregard me?
Me? Do you dare to despise me?

171
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,870
Master! You attacked me!

172
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:39,939
Throw him in! Do it quickly!

173
00:16:57,429 --> 00:17:01,002
- Keep silence about this!
- Yes.

174
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:04,133
Mataichirou left the castle alone.

175
00:17:05,034 --> 00:17:06,876
Tell the servants this without fail.

176
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,864
- It will be done.
- Fill the well with earth and sand.

177
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,309
Nail down the cover.

178
00:17:21,076 --> 00:17:24,444
What? Mr. Mataichirou has not yet
returned from the castle?

179
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:27,570
Yes. Yes, up to now he has always been
brought by palanquin from the castle,

180
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:29,736
no matter how late it was.

181
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:32,889
He never played Go with the Master
for the whole night.

182
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:37,124
Yesterday I had a day off, and wasn't in
the castle. Did you send someone there?

183
00:17:38,056 --> 00:17:40,601
I sent Yousuke for my brother
early this morning...

184
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:45,242
Last evening he refused to take
the palanquin and went alone.

185
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:47,266
- Refused to take the palanquin?
- Yes.

186
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:51,076
That is strange...

187
00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:56,268
I will immediately go and check the
road by which he could have gone.

188
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:57,865
Thank you very much!

189
00:17:58,988 --> 00:18:01,857
We shouldn't have killed Mataichirou...

190
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:06,656
What are you talking about? Though his
ancestors ruled here in former times,

191
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:09,762
it was necessary to punish him
for his spurn of the Master.

192
00:18:11,932 --> 00:18:14,335
Master, please, have no doubt!

193
00:18:16,256 --> 00:18:18,848
There is a younger sister in
Ryuuzouji family besides him.

194
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:23,634
If we undertake nothing, Mataichirou's
death will be revealed some day.

195
00:18:25,832 --> 00:18:27,113
However, what should we do?

196
00:18:31,223 --> 00:18:32,156
Miss...

197
00:18:33,673 --> 00:18:35,523
Did you find my brother?

198
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:44,924
Not yet. Is there any news from Komori?

199
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:51,509
He searched everywhere,
but he found no tracks thus far.

200
00:18:53,202 --> 00:18:55,795
He had to return to the castle
for his service.

201
00:19:23,198 --> 00:19:24,099
Brother?

202
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:50,078
Tama?

203
00:21:08,762 --> 00:21:12,603
Tama, where did you find it?

204
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:23,044
Miss, a messenger arrived
from the castle.

205
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,672
- From the castle?
- Yes.

206
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:30,743
Servant, leave us!

207
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:36,894
The order.

208
00:21:46,449 --> 00:21:49,492
Ryuuzouji Mataichirou
and his younger sister Sayo,

209
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:52,488
although you received the undeserved
benefaction of Lord Nabeshima,

210
00:21:52,608 --> 00:21:54,306
recently you commited
an unforgivable deed.

211
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,136
You forgot yourself,
you exceeded your rights,

212
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:02,594
therefore you are deprived of your land
and you are banished.

213
00:22:03,874 --> 00:22:05,427
I want to address the Official
of Secret Supervision.

214
00:22:05,547 --> 00:22:06,865
This order is not subject to discussion.

215
00:22:07,197 --> 00:22:11,509
But Mataichirou, the Ryuuzouji family
head, has not returned from the castle.

216
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:13,803
I have nothing to do with it.

217
00:22:14,475 --> 00:22:19,241
So you must leave this house
by tomorrow noon.

218
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:22,023
I have communicated this
order to you exactly.

219
00:22:42,508 --> 00:22:43,457
Miss!

220
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:48,603
What did the messenger want?

221
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:51,053
Nothing.

222
00:22:53,693 --> 00:22:55,606
- Yousuke.
- Yes.

223
00:22:57,234 --> 00:23:00,981
Excuse me, please. Could you go now
to the temple Zyorin?

224
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:03,368
To the temple Zyorin?

225
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,707
I want to visit the graves of
my ancestors tomorrow.

226
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,126
Tell the Prior about it, please.

227
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,999
But... Could I do it tomorrow morning?

228
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,529
I want to go there tomorrow
in the very early morning.

229
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:18,485
I know, it's night already,
but I beg you to do it.

230
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,200
Yes.

231
00:23:35,198 --> 00:23:38,881
Kikuro, you went out on the commission
of the Official of Secret Supervision?

232
00:23:39,277 --> 00:23:40,573
To the house of Ryuuzouji.

233
00:23:40,693 --> 00:23:43,798
I see. What matter have you got?

234
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:02,700
They say, if a cat drinks human blood,

235
00:24:03,585 --> 00:24:05,087
it will receive magic powers
and a devilish nature.

236
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:08,913
Tama.

237
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:14,848
If you have not forgotten,
that my elder brother always loved you,

238
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,809
curse those evil people who killed him!

239
00:25:06,524 --> 00:25:11,504
Well, Tama, now then, now then,
drink my blood.

240
00:25:12,848 --> 00:25:16,863
Become a real devil,
and receive magic power.

241
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:22,797
And curse the house of Nabeshima.

242
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:32,654
Now then... drink my blood.

243
00:26:05,061 --> 00:26:08,745
Tama... You understood...

244
00:26:12,033 --> 00:26:13,867
You understood me...

245
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:06,447
Miss Sayo!

246
00:27:36,982 --> 00:27:38,152
Did Sayo kill herself?

247
00:27:38,272 --> 00:27:40,460
Yes. Komori told me about it just now.

248
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,386
It serves her right!

249
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:44,679
Toyo!

250
00:27:46,402 --> 00:27:48,615
You have to bear an heir
as soon as possible now.

251
00:27:49,422 --> 00:27:51,161
You will conquer the heart
of the Master then.

252
00:27:51,801 --> 00:27:54,757
And then all 370,000 koku of
Saga castle will be ours.

253
00:27:55,469 --> 00:27:57,469
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

254
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,959
Mr. Main Vassal, let us
celebrate our victory this evening.

255
00:28:14,576 --> 00:28:17,975
- What is it?
- Have you heard this cry? It is a cat.

256
00:28:18,955 --> 00:28:21,042
- No.
- It is strange.

257
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:25,732
Probably, it seemed so to you.
Well, I will go make preparations.

258
00:28:28,126 --> 00:28:30,498
Attention!

259
00:28:31,689 --> 00:28:34,629
Beware of fire!

260
00:28:37,206 --> 00:28:39,230
Attention!

261
00:28:39,704 --> 00:28:42,068
Beware of fire!

262
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,542
Attention!

263
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:49,375
Beware of fire!

264
00:28:51,218 --> 00:28:53,067
Attention!

265
00:28:53,763 --> 00:28:56,198
Beware of fire!

266
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,229
Attention!

267
00:29:01,154 --> 00:29:02,134
Bewa...

268
00:29:36,882 --> 00:29:38,192
Madam, have you heard a cry?

269
00:29:38,312 --> 00:29:40,043
Yes, it was in front of the entrance
to the kikyo room.

270
00:29:40,431 --> 00:29:41,743
I beg your pardon, I have to
go for my duties!

271
00:30:56,905 --> 00:30:57,822
Who are you?

272
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:05,396
Oh, Mrs. Sawanoi.

273
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:07,862
Mr. Komori, Chief of Servants.

274
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,234
This is female territory.

275
00:31:10,993 --> 00:31:14,163
- Who permitted you to come here?
- Pressing business. Permissions later.

276
00:31:14,926 --> 00:31:18,183
- What pressing business?
- Did not you notice?

277
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,416
Two maids perished
under strange circumstances.

278
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:24,603
What? Two maids?

279
00:31:25,046 --> 00:31:25,978
Yes.

280
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,548
Whatever occurred on female territory,
this concerns only us.

281
00:31:32,206 --> 00:31:34,372
- You should leave.
- But...

282
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:38,704
Yes.

283
00:32:16,784 --> 00:32:17,716
Get out!

284
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:16,754
Wha... What the hell!?!

285
00:33:25,813 --> 00:33:28,026
Someone! Here!

286
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:31,425
Master! What's wrong with you?

287
00:33:33,275 --> 00:33:37,355
Mataichirou... There was the head of
Mataichirou on the Go-board!

288
00:33:52,346 --> 00:33:53,342
Master!

289
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,453
It was there.

290
00:34:05,674 --> 00:34:07,714
- Leave.
- Yes.

291
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:33,354
It is strange.

292
00:34:34,777 --> 00:34:37,654
Bloody tracks of a cat in the castle.

293
00:34:39,062 --> 00:34:41,433
Komori, are you sure?

294
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:46,121
It is the truth. The maids from female
territory saw these tracks besides me.

295
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:48,577
I also saw bloody tracks.

296
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:52,909
Moreover two maids perished
under strange circumstances.

297
00:34:54,356 --> 00:34:55,905
All of this is very unusual.

298
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,924
Thus, you think,

299
00:34:58,462 --> 00:35:01,229
that this was made by the cat or
some another strange creature?

300
00:35:02,114 --> 00:35:04,849
I think that we do not have any
other explanations.

301
00:35:06,555 --> 00:35:08,325
Mr. Shimazaki, what do you think?

302
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:11,835
We should strengthen
the protection of the castle

303
00:35:12,765 --> 00:35:16,338
and dispel this fear.
There is no other solution.

304
00:35:17,777 --> 00:35:19,105
Mr. Gyoubu, what is your opinion?

305
00:35:20,091 --> 00:35:21,340
There is no other solution.

306
00:35:22,248 --> 00:35:23,403
- Komori!
- Yes!

307
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:25,679
You know the castle better than others,

308
00:35:26,352 --> 00:35:29,371
and you are the Chief of Servants.
Attend to this business.

309
00:35:31,031 --> 00:35:31,901
It will be done.

310
00:35:32,021 --> 00:35:35,960
If you need, I permit you to go
into any part of the castle.

311
00:35:37,752 --> 00:35:39,791
- Including female territory.
- Yes.

312
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:50,736
- Miss Sanae.
- Yes.

313
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:53,281
The Master's wife has already awakened.

314
00:35:55,336 --> 00:35:57,565
She takes a bath every morning,
do you understand me?

315
00:35:57,685 --> 00:36:00,158
Yes, I am ready to take her there
at any time.

316
00:36:00,937 --> 00:36:04,257
- Miss Namie, what's about breakfast?
- Everything will be ready in time.

317
00:36:05,198 --> 00:36:09,435
The new cook does not know yet,
what the wife of the Master likes.

318
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:13,000
It is impossible to cook fish and meat.

319
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:15,885
She hates dried tunny,
even if it is in the soup.

320
00:36:17,292 --> 00:36:19,205
- Explain it to him properly.
- Yes.

321
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,714
Where is the sword?

322
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,900
Someone, come here! Here!

323
00:38:39,671 --> 00:38:41,766
Master! Excuse me!

324
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,364
Please, open!

325
00:39:27,313 --> 00:39:28,483
Who is there?

326
00:39:28,603 --> 00:39:30,048
Komori Hanazaemon, the Chief of Servants.

327
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,064
I must look around everything here.

328
00:39:41,482 --> 00:39:46,146
Something strange occurred in the
bedroom of the Master. Be careful.

329
00:39:46,895 --> 00:39:47,891
Certainly, sir.

330
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:11,766
Blood!

331
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:26,147
- Madam!
- I thank you for your concern.

332
00:40:26,756 --> 00:40:28,179
What's wrong with you?

333
00:40:29,736 --> 00:40:33,182
Nothing, I've just had a headache
since this morning.

334
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:49,618
Seven days have passed already since
the death of Miss Sayo.

335
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,105
Funeral ceremonies are finished.

336
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:52,955
Yes. Thank you very much.

337
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,639
Miss Sanae expresses her gratitude.

338
00:40:57,279 --> 00:40:59,508
Miss Sayo and I were very close,

339
00:41:00,779 --> 00:41:03,119
we were friends all the time
that I served in the castle.

340
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:08,099
Even now, I can't believe she is gone.

341
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:15,984
By the way, Mr. Hanazaemon.

342
00:41:17,012 --> 00:41:18,166
You said that the castle

343
00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:21,154
is terrorized by the cat,

344
00:41:22,236 --> 00:41:26,252
which lived in the house of Ryuuzouji.

345
00:41:27,564 --> 00:41:28,608
I think about it all the time.

346
00:41:29,975 --> 00:41:33,825
The cat mysteriously disappeared
from the place of Miss Sayo's suicide,

347
00:41:34,331 --> 00:41:35,936
and cat tracks were discovered

348
00:41:36,545 --> 00:41:37,794
in the female territory of the castle.

349
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,735
The cat, which obtained devilish power,
cannot distinguish good and evil.

350
00:41:43,035 --> 00:41:45,059
Two maids have perished already.

351
00:41:46,278 --> 00:41:49,455
It is necessary to figure out
Mr. Mataichirou's destiny.

352
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:52,855
We can't allow the ghost to
continue to have charge of the castle!

353
00:41:55,856 --> 00:41:57,184
- Miss Sanae.
- Yes?

354
00:41:59,176 --> 00:42:02,140
Did you note something strange
in the behavior of Mrs. Sawanoi?

355
00:42:06,145 --> 00:42:07,046
Anything?

356
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:11,378
Mr. Komori, when I was yesterday
on female territory,

357
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,204
I saw bloody cat tracks in the corridor.

358
00:42:15,773 --> 00:42:17,575
Bloody? And what else?

359
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:20,943
Mrs. Sawanoi stood next to them.

360
00:42:21,402 --> 00:42:22,793
- Next to them?
- Yes.

361
00:42:23,315 --> 00:42:26,904
Mr. Komori, it appears,
this woman is a ghost?

362
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:30,113
I cannot assert it now.

363
00:42:31,402 --> 00:42:35,853
Anyway, Miss Sanae, keep an eye
on Miss Sawanoi attentively.

364
00:42:35,973 --> 00:42:37,007
Certainly, sir.

365
00:43:37,404 --> 00:43:42,226
Attention! Beware of fire!

366
00:44:24,142 --> 00:44:25,217
Sawanoi!

367
00:44:31,076 --> 00:44:32,057
Sawanoi!

368
00:46:09,565 --> 00:46:12,316
Have you seen?

369
00:46:19,061 --> 00:46:21,638
Have you seen?

370
00:46:24,378 --> 00:46:27,272
You have seen!

371
00:48:23,315 --> 00:48:27,504
- Hey, are you the maids of the wife
of the Master? Get on the ball! - Yes.

372
00:50:46,033 --> 00:50:46,997
Madam!

373
00:53:10,597 --> 00:53:14,312
Have you already awoken?
May I prepare your bath for you?

374
00:53:15,545 --> 00:53:16,509
Bath?

375
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:20,731
Well, I feel a bit languid this morning.

376
00:53:21,069 --> 00:53:24,499
I see. Then breakfast right away?

377
00:53:37,543 --> 00:53:38,697
How are you?

378
00:53:39,045 --> 00:53:42,476
Just awful... I tremble all over.

379
00:53:43,203 --> 00:53:46,634
You bet.
Sawanoi was possessed by ghost.

380
00:53:47,361 --> 00:53:49,305
It is good that nothing happened to you.

381
00:53:54,056 --> 00:53:58,483
Hey, you! Keep silent about
the events you saw yesterday!

382
00:54:11,201 --> 00:54:12,840
Is this my breakfast?

383
00:54:13,604 --> 00:54:15,799
Yes, your usual breakfast.

384
00:54:16,242 --> 00:54:17,364
Bring me another one!

385
00:54:19,151 --> 00:54:24,012
This breakfast will not give me energy!
Bring dried fish!

386
00:54:27,775 --> 00:54:31,787
- What's wrong? Bring it immediately!
- Yes.

387
00:54:32,751 --> 00:54:34,316
Did you sleep well?

388
00:54:34,901 --> 00:54:39,683
No. I could snooze a little bit
just before the morning.

389
00:54:40,588 --> 00:54:42,660
You have too weak will,
you should be stronger.

390
00:54:43,324 --> 00:54:45,442
Do not worry because of Sawanoi.

391
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:50,067
Master, you should entertain yourself
this evening. Admire the moonlight.

392
00:54:53,932 --> 00:54:55,181
Master, how are you?

393
00:54:56,224 --> 00:54:58,406
Much better.

394
00:54:58,746 --> 00:55:00,090
It's very well.

395
00:55:01,544 --> 00:55:02,446
Bring sake.

396
00:55:08,342 --> 00:55:13,955
Master, you should move to another
house as soon as possible.

397
00:55:15,678 --> 00:55:16,769
Yes, it's a very good idea.

398
00:55:27,501 --> 00:55:31,533
I brought you sake.

399
00:55:44,731 --> 00:55:46,114
Are you crazy?

400
00:56:09,026 --> 00:56:11,880
- Master!
- Release me!

401
00:56:12,133 --> 00:56:13,239
Master!

402
00:56:24,992 --> 00:56:26,462
Toyo! Take him away immediately!

403
00:56:49,514 --> 00:56:50,668
Toyo.

404
00:56:52,433 --> 00:56:53,539
Where did you go?

405
00:56:54,528 --> 00:56:57,373
I prepared a restful decoction for you.

406
00:57:02,654 --> 00:57:05,136
Are you still frightened?

407
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:11,097
Please, drink it.

408
00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:24,826
This is sake, it will
put you in good spirits.

409
00:58:10,335 --> 00:58:12,422
She took a bath every morning before,

410
00:58:12,975 --> 00:58:15,804
and not once, from the day Sawanoi died
till the present day?

411
00:58:15,924 --> 00:58:16,864
Yes.

412
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:19,195
On top of that, she eats fish
with pleasure three times a day,

413
00:58:19,764 --> 00:58:21,677
which she hated before.

414
00:58:23,858 --> 00:58:26,499
Probably the ghost possesses Madam now?

415
00:58:28,585 --> 00:58:34,458
I do not know exactly, but in any case,
you should be careful with Toyo.

416
00:58:34,896 --> 00:58:36,130
Certainly, sir.

417
00:58:51,959 --> 00:58:53,761
- What's about the Master?
- I do not understand.

418
00:58:54,228 --> 00:58:55,176
Don't you understand?

419
00:58:55,296 --> 00:58:59,358
Yes. I really do not understand why
he lost so many energy in one night.

420
00:58:59,865 --> 00:59:06,561
He became very tired, as if
something sucked all his energy.

421
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:10,122
- Do not say such terrible things.
- Excuse me.

422
00:59:11,462 --> 00:59:14,181
Attention!

423
00:59:14,947 --> 00:59:18,378
Beware of fire!

424
00:59:19,484 --> 00:59:21,729
Attention!

425
00:59:23,094 --> 00:59:26,193
Beware of fire!

426
00:59:27,094 --> 00:59:29,023
Attention!

427
00:59:31,544 --> 00:59:34,864
Beware of fire!

428
01:01:08,558 --> 01:01:11,467
Come here, come!

429
01:01:12,723 --> 01:01:14,273
Come?

430
01:03:03,906 --> 01:03:06,230
What? The ghost possesses Toyo now?

431
01:03:06,768 --> 01:03:10,894
Yes. I know it is difficult to believe,
but I must tell you about it.

432
01:03:14,009 --> 01:03:16,610
Near the pond, where Miss Namie
perished, we found it.

433
01:03:20,598 --> 01:03:24,803
We should find a way to banish the
ghost from Toyo as soon as possible.

434
01:03:25,538 --> 01:03:29,482
It is clear. Remove this dirty fish.
You can go.

435
01:03:29,602 --> 01:03:31,992
- But it is very important...
- I said - leave!

436
01:03:32,546 --> 01:03:33,463
Yes.

437
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:44,523
I cannot believe it...

438
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:48,583
Toyo hated fish so much,
and now she eats it every morning.

439
01:04:55,656 --> 01:04:58,979
To be on the safe side, lock her
in her room this evening.

440
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:00,314
Tell her, let her pray
for the health of the Master.

441
01:05:00,434 --> 01:05:01,342
Yes.

442
01:05:01,594 --> 01:05:02,969
Invite monks from Raydzinyama.

443
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:04,771
Let us pray that the ghost
will leave her.

444
01:05:05,029 --> 01:05:08,325
Depart, ghost, depart!

445
01:09:07,902 --> 01:09:09,768
Miss Sanae, Miss Sanae!

446
01:09:17,501 --> 01:09:18,624
This is my...

447
01:09:19,667 --> 01:09:21,849
Is this... an amulet?

448
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:27,264
Yes. When I was a child,
the monk of Dzerin temple gave it me.

449
01:09:45,952 --> 01:09:49,872
Sir! The Main Vassal, sir!

450
01:09:50,995 --> 01:09:53,674
There is no doubt about
the true appearance of Mrs. Toyo.

451
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:56,592
- Komori! - It is necessary to gather
all the archers this evening...

452
01:09:56,712 --> 01:10:00,651
Komori! Do you want to kill Toyo?

453
01:10:02,357 --> 01:10:04,965
If it is necessary to save Master,
although it would be a pity...

454
01:10:05,085 --> 01:10:06,120
- Wait!
- No.

455
01:10:08,171 --> 01:10:09,167
It will be dawn soon.

456
01:10:10,258 --> 01:10:13,941
The ghost will not be able
to act in the daytime.

457
01:10:15,079 --> 01:10:17,767
And then there will be one
final battle this evening.

458
01:10:19,179 --> 01:10:20,223
Komori...

459
01:10:20,729 --> 01:10:23,733
I have an idea.
Please, trust me.

460
01:10:50,551 --> 01:10:55,097
Shiose, have you already
prepared the archers?

461
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:58,781
Yes. They will stand in the wings
after sunset.

462
01:10:59,287 --> 01:11:00,346
I placed them as you ordered.

463
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:04,820
It is good. What's about Toyo?

464
01:11:21,504 --> 01:11:23,939
No information since then.

465
01:11:24,879 --> 01:11:27,567
Mr. Vassal, do you really
intend to kill her?

466
01:11:30,191 --> 01:11:32,957
She was my younger sister,
but she is a ghost now.

467
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:35,867
We must protect the castle.

468
01:11:47,191 --> 01:11:49,009
- Will you go?
- Yes.

469
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:53,136
It would be better you don't go there.

470
01:12:18,328 --> 01:12:24,114
Komori, please, do not move a step
from my side this evening.

471
01:12:24,383 --> 01:12:25,411
Yes.

472
01:12:36,908 --> 01:12:38,631
- Shiose, Kamata!
- Yes.

473
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:43,216
- Follow me!
- Where?

474
01:12:43,793 --> 01:12:47,350
Where doesn't matter. I want to leave
the castle for this evening.

475
01:13:09,471 --> 01:13:12,222
- Did you hear this?
- What?

476
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:16,293
This ringing. And a cat crying.

477
01:13:17,035 --> 01:13:18,031
Cat?

478
01:13:19,059 --> 01:13:19,865
Yes...

479
01:13:31,719 --> 01:13:32,652
Toyo!

480
01:13:33,253 --> 01:13:34,312
Brother...

481
01:13:35,102 --> 01:13:41,063
Brother... You were going
to leave your younger sister?

482
01:13:42,327 --> 01:13:44,715
Wait, wait! Toyo!

483
01:17:36,575 --> 01:17:38,915
Komori, Komori!

484
01:17:42,668 --> 01:17:44,012
Are you here?

485
01:18:09,855 --> 01:18:11,310
Tango-no-kami!

486
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:15,753
Now you will know the vengeance
of the Ryuuzouji family!

487
01:21:44,584 --> 01:21:47,201
From that day, in the middle of
November, year 14 of the Kyoho era,

488
01:21:48,386 --> 01:21:52,782
horror had left Saga castle.

489
01:21:55,892 --> 01:21:58,816
Tango-no-kami was disgraced,

490
01:21:59,709 --> 01:22:02,808
he restored his obligations
to the Ryuuzouji family,

491
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,417
and this terrible story was finished.

492
01:22:06,681 --> 01:22:09,058
Hanazaemon left these places

493
01:22:09,178 --> 01:22:11,066
in search of relatives of Ryuuzouji,

494
01:22:11,186 --> 01:22:13,384
who lived in Hirado, Chikuzen Province.
