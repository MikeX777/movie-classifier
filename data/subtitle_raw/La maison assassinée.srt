1
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:38,243
1896, September the 28th,
Eve of St Michael’s day

2
00:01:16,028 --> 00:01:19,028
Hello, everybody.

3
00:01:34,335 --> 00:01:38,585
I’m a journeyman, coming from Jura,
on the road since St John’s day.

4
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:45,365
Board and lodging?

5
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:11,826
Hey, Monge, can’t you
hear something?

6
00:02:14,106 --> 00:02:17,308
I do.

7
00:02:48,555 --> 00:02:53,058
Monge! If you can’t hear
anything now, you’re deaf.

8
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:06,195
Lucien! Take him to
the stables and hurry back.

9
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:20,646
Good night, everybody.

10
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:39,687
- Who is he?
- Shut up.

11
00:03:39,688 --> 00:03:43,510
- Do you think they’ll finally
go to bed? - Finally, yes.

12
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:08,592
- Did you recognize him?
- Yes.

13
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:11,815
- What shall we do?
- We can’t do anything else.

14
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:15,863
What if we’re caught?

15
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:39,024
- Their throats cut. - What is it?
- All dead, their throats cut.

16
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:41,218
Come on, let him pass.
And let no one go inside.

17
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:43,429
- Their throats cut.
- They’re all dead.

18
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:53,521
- Only the baby lived. - All dead.
- Their throats cut...

19
00:06:30,702 --> 00:06:34,542
<i>I can boast of one thing:
I was the first to see him.</i>

20
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:37,692
<i>And just after that, it was
the Rose Pujol girl.</i>

21
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,825
<i>That one had time to waste, always
dragging her bottom around.</i>

22
00:06:45,068 --> 00:06:47,749
<i>At that time, I didn’t know
his name yet.</i>

23
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,655
<i>And the Monges,
I had all but forgotten them.</i>

24
00:06:56,747 --> 00:07:00,433
- Who wants him?
- Monge. Séraphin Monge.

25
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:21,832
<i>The Tricanote woman, read fortunes in herbs,
but failed to predict the return of Monge.</i>

26
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:25,174
<i>She wasted no time in correcting
the mistake of the village.</i>

27
00:07:25,282 --> 00:07:28,741
I should have... We should have
reported to you.

28
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:33,012
There couldn’t be a Board of Guardians,
since you didn’t have any family left.

29
00:07:33,013 --> 00:07:35,222
So we had to deal with the
most urgent matters first:

30
00:07:35,223 --> 00:07:38,652
provide you with a wet nurse,
then see to your education

31
00:07:38,653 --> 00:07:42,164
and, say what you will, the Sisters
of Mercy are not for the poor.

32
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:46,811
The estate was sold.
The Burlière, unfortunately...

33
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:50,547
- The Burlière?
- The house of your family.

34
00:07:50,548 --> 00:07:53,739
- We couldn’t sell it.
- Why?

35
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,278
Why? Well...

36
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,102
- Of course you know.
- No.

37
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:03,847
You don’t know but... you did read
your family record book.

38
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:06,966
Yes, but... I know I’m an orphan.

39
00:08:06,967 --> 00:08:10,856
Well, you know, I was
ten at the time.

40
00:08:12,252 --> 00:08:15,550
And what do you care, after all?
The past is the past.

41
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:18,383
You weren’t raised by the
Sisters of Mercy, were you?

42
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:21,094
- No.
- I was.

43
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:25,110
Well. There are 1250 francs
and 50 centimes

44
00:08:25,111 --> 00:08:26,653
left from the sale of the estate
and the cattle.

45
00:08:26,654 --> 00:08:31,797
They’re yours, as well as the house
of which here is the key.

46
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:34,300
- Mr. Notary.
- Yes.

47
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:35,655
I meant to ask you.

48
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:38,432
Every month, while I was on the front,
I received a package from here.

49
00:08:38,433 --> 00:08:43,453
- Do you know who sent it?
- A package? Probably my poor father.

50
00:08:43,454 --> 00:08:46,353
- He was so good.
- Your poor father? Did he die?

51
00:08:46,354 --> 00:08:48,721
- Yes, in 1916.
- No, it wasn’t him.

52
00:08:48,722 --> 00:08:52,185
I got them until the end, until last month
in Poland, before I was discharged.

53
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:56,471
- Was there no return address?
- No, never.

54
00:09:01,796 --> 00:09:05,466
Hello. I’m Rose. Rose Pujol.

55
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:08,094
<i>Séraphin Monge was back
from the war.</i>

56
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,465
<i>The municipality provided him
with a room in the village</i>

57
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:14,609
<i>and a job as a road mender. And he
was going to work with me too.</i>

58
00:09:16,544 --> 00:09:18,912
Rose!

59
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:26,037
<i>Pujol wanted to give
his daughter in marriage.</i>

60
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:31,773
<i>But he was like a lot of the old ones:
he thought that misery had come back.</i>

61
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:03,060
<i>I really don’t know why
he didn’t go inside then.</i>

62
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,391
<i>Well, I’m saying that,
but I understand.</i>

63
00:10:05,392 --> 00:10:10,860
<i>That house... It seemed like everybody
made a detour not to see it.</i>

64
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:14,691
<i>I followed him to his new home,</i>

65
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:17,638
<i>but I didn’t dare talk to him
on that day.</i>

66
00:10:21,357 --> 00:10:22,416
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

67
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:26,234
<i>During several days,
we worked side by side.</i>

68
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,035
Good morning.

69
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:43,690
She said hello to me but I’m sure
I’m not the one she’s interested in.

70
00:10:43,691 --> 00:10:46,940
She even had to make a big
detour to come this way.

71
00:10:46,941 --> 00:10:49,383
She’s Marie Dormeur,
the baker’s daughter.

72
00:10:49,384 --> 00:10:51,751
Every morning, she delivers
bread in Peyrolles.

73
00:10:52,038 --> 00:10:54,816
And she never comes this way.

74
00:10:56,871 --> 00:10:59,195
We would be well advised
to go back.

75
00:10:59,196 --> 00:11:01,229
Can you see, kid? When the sky
is this colour over Les Mays,

76
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,895
it means it’s going to rain badly.

77
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:06,159
No, Les Mays are this way.

78
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:08,406
You’ve got to learn
to know your country.

79
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:12,464
A bloke who’s from here and doesn’t
know how things are called is unseemly.

80
00:11:12,643 --> 00:11:16,830
- Hey! What’s the small rock there?
- La Beldonne?

81
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:21,097
No, I told you twenty times already:
it’s Goua’s Rock.

82
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,271
Here it comes.

83
00:11:24,874 --> 00:11:26,492
- Wait!
- What?

84
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:27,389
- Come.
- Where?

85
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,659
Come, I tell you.

86
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:51,102
- Come in!
- No.

87
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,835
- Do you want to catch your death?
Come in! - No.

88
00:11:53,836 --> 00:11:57,495
Come on.

89
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,275
You can’t understand.

90
00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:10,554
Oh, after all, you’re right.

91
00:12:11,155 --> 00:12:13,311
I knew two of them
in my bloody life.

92
00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:15,343
Two road-menders, almost
as strong as I am.

93
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:18,783
After a rain such as this one,
they didn’t last eight days.

94
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:24,492
The stronger you are, the more
transparent are your lungs.

95
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,783
Do you realize, kid?

96
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:35,084
The wood that we’re burning
has been cut 23 years ago.

97
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,458
23 years...

98
00:12:37,849 --> 00:12:39,677
Hey, what are you doing?
Are you listening to me?

99
00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:41,448
I’m looking around.

100
00:12:41,675 --> 00:12:46,024
23 years. And just the
same as it was.

101
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:50,175
Except for the holes in the roof,
nothing’s changed.

102
00:12:50,351 --> 00:12:52,791
And it was clean, mind you.
The Guirard woman.

103
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:55,567
Everything was shining
in their home.

104
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:59,230
- The Guirard woman?
- Your mother.

105
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,883
My mother?

106
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,128
Nobody dared to tell you.

107
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,701
When you were taken to the Sisters
of Mercy, you were three weeks old.

108
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,780
You remember that?

109
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,403
- I don’t know if I should.
- Why shouldn’t you?

110
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:14,719
Damn! The storm will
get us in the end.

111
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,069
You’ll have escaped the war and
the Spanish flu to be killed by lightning.

112
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:25,328
Why shouldn’t you?

113
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:30,703
Behind that door, there were
maybe fifty of us.

114
00:13:30,704 --> 00:13:32,826
Riveted. Silent.

115
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:36,301
And in this room, there were
only two sounds that morning.

116
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:40,718
The clock and a crying baby. You.

117
00:13:42,426 --> 00:13:44,595
They took the bodies out
then they took you away.

118
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:46,836
What bodies?

119
00:13:46,837 --> 00:13:49,567
What I remember most
is the smell.

120
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:52,725
It smelled of blood. Warm blood,
you can’t imagine.

121
00:13:52,726 --> 00:13:56,135
- Oh, yes, I can.
- Oh, yes, that’s true,

122
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,783
you know the smell.
You were in the war.

123
00:13:58,844 --> 00:14:02,847
But I hadn’t been. There was
blood everywhere.

124
00:14:02,848 --> 00:14:07,489
Everywhere you see dust on the floor,
there were bloody footprints.

125
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,378
Their feet had waded in blood.

126
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:14,225
And here, here where I'm sitting,
there was the grandad.

127
00:14:14,226 --> 00:14:19,757
Your mother’s father. His blood
made him a red beard on his shirt.

128
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:24,186
It looked as if they’d knotted a red napkin
around his neck to feed him his soup.

129
00:14:25,423 --> 00:14:31,117
And here... was Monge.
Sprawled against the wall.

130
00:14:31,118 --> 00:14:34,809
- "Lightning Bolt" Monge.
- "Lightning Bolt" Monge?

131
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,655
Yes. Your father.

132
00:14:37,465 --> 00:14:41,390
The murdered had skewered him with the
Christmas spit that was hanging there.

133
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:44,278
And your father, with
the spit in his body,

134
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,517
still had the strength
to drag himself here.

135
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,704
You could see the mark of
his hands near the salt box.

136
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:52,519
Hey, you can still see it here.

137
00:14:58,601 --> 00:15:02,814
And here were your two brothers,
left at the bottom of the cupboard,

138
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,362
their throat open too.

139
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:11,596
And here your mother
was lying, her skirts lifted.

140
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:14,320
- My mother...
- No, don’t worry, she wasn’t raped.

141
00:15:15,178 --> 00:15:21,784
Her throat was open too. But she
was the only one with closed eyes.

142
00:15:21,785 --> 00:15:25,981
As if someone had taken pity on her.

143
00:15:25,982 --> 00:15:28,185
All the others still looked at you.

144
00:15:29,627 --> 00:15:34,026
Oh, I know what you want to know.
The murderers were found.

145
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:37,519
They were supposedly three blokes
working on the railway.

146
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,908
They were found dead drunk, with
four bottles of your father’s brandy.

147
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:48,187
They came from over there...
some country... Herzegovina, they said.

148
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:51,577
It was really hell to find
an interpreter.

149
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:56,466
So they were guillotined.

150
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:59,397
Can you understand, now,
why everything stayed as it was?

151
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:02,682
Why no one came to steal even
a gram of salt in the salt shaker?

152
00:16:02,683 --> 00:16:05,831
Should they have given the Burlière
away, nobody would have wanted it.

153
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:09,652
In this house, there’s the mark
of murder and especially...

154
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:13,005
especially the mark of the gallows.

155
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:19,103
I think... it couldn’t happen
that way.

156
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:22,215
There was too much
mystery behind Monge.

157
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:24,224
It couldn’t happen that way.

158
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:27,230
And maybe you know how it could
have happened, you shapeless scum?

159
00:16:30,062 --> 00:16:32,920
I knew someone would finally
open this fucking door.

160
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:36,503
- We had to take shelter.
- You, shut up.

161
00:16:38,337 --> 00:16:40,269
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing.

162
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,456
Well, everything...
everything that could be told.

163
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:44,853
Oh, so you know what can
and can’t be told?

164
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:48,878
You poisoned his life.
That’s what you did.

165
00:16:51,913 --> 00:16:56,399
- Who’s he?
- He’s Zorme. He’s got powers.

166
00:17:01,512 --> 00:17:03,511
- What’s he saying?
- Nothing.

167
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:05,523
His mouth is wide open
but he’s not talking to us.

168
00:17:15,924 --> 00:17:18,284
- What’s your trouble?
- My mother...

169
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:21,224
Well, your mother... Your mother
died more than 20 years ago.

170
00:17:22,314 --> 00:17:24,876
Five minutes ago to me.

171
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:29,381
Séraphin!
I know you’re here.

172
00:17:32,394 --> 00:17:34,404
- Do you recognize me?
- Yes.

173
00:17:34,405 --> 00:17:36,340
Why didn’t you come to
the war memorial?

174
00:17:36,341 --> 00:17:39,276
- Because I’m alive.
- You were wrong. Everybody’s there.

175
00:17:39,277 --> 00:17:41,551
They don’t like you a lot
around here, so...

176
00:17:41,552 --> 00:17:43,434
That I came back from the war
is no fault of mine.

177
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:46,879
That’s not it. It was my father who
said they had to write your name down.

178
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,712
He’s a town councilor.

179
00:17:48,713 --> 00:17:51,864
We had one less dead than
in Peyrolles, so it didn’t look right.

180
00:17:51,865 --> 00:17:54,753
- It wasn’t to spite you.
- What do you want?

181
00:17:54,754 --> 00:17:58,063
I? Nothing. Bye.

182
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:04,007
Séraphin? Won’t you come
to the banquet?

183
00:18:04,008 --> 00:18:06,054
- I’m not invited.
- I invite you.

184
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:15,374
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

185
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,135
I’m waiting for you.
Do you mind?

186
00:18:18,136 --> 00:18:20,132
They didn’t like having to scratch
my name from the memorial.

187
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:21,820
So, if they see us arriving together...

188
00:18:21,821 --> 00:18:23,376
Good morning, Mr. Dormeur.

189
00:18:23,377 --> 00:18:26,026
- Good morning, Mrs. Dormeur.
- Take a seat. I’ll wait on you directly.

190
00:18:26,894 --> 00:18:29,859
Good morning, Marie.
I hope there’s some left for us.

191
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
What is she doing with him?

192
00:18:33,801 --> 00:18:35,968
Do you know what my mother
told me about him and his house?

193
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:37,863
- We all know it.
- I wouldn’t be able to do it.

194
00:18:37,864 --> 00:18:40,935
I’d feel all of his dead family
lying beside me.

195
00:18:40,936 --> 00:18:44,167
- What about you? Could you?
- Yes.

196
00:18:46,702 --> 00:18:49,652
So, the guy from Peyrolles answers:

197
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:54,060
"The railway will pass through our place
because we are a heroic village. "

198
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:58,319
Heroic village? Heroic village?
As it they were the only ones.

199
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,311
If it goes on like this, soon France
will be nothing but railway stations.

200
00:19:01,878 --> 00:19:04,256
- Hey, Rose, will you dance?
- Not today.

201
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:06,364
- We danced during the
whole war. Come. - I’m not alone.

202
00:19:06,365 --> 00:19:07,943
Since they came back,
they’ve got it all.

203
00:19:07,944 --> 00:19:12,030
Hey! You who are just back from it,
will there be another war soon.

204
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:16,799
Yeah! They’ll all go away again
and I’ll dance with the girls.

205
00:19:17,995 --> 00:19:20,047
Come.

206
00:19:29,442 --> 00:19:33,277
Séraphin. You must take a bread.

207
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,120
No, not that one.
It’s the Zorme’s,

208
00:19:37,121 --> 00:19:39,008
just in case...
Here, take this one.

209
00:19:41,154 --> 00:19:43,072
And his father is the ingenior
from the PLM.

210
00:19:43,073 --> 00:19:45,264
He decides where they
build the stations.

211
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:52,455
Oh, Séraphin, come here:
I kept a chair for you.

212
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,064
I’ll say one thing: the railway
is good for business,

213
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:06,154
true, but you’ll see all the
foreigners it will bring to us.

214
00:20:06,155 --> 00:20:08,245
Well, if they’re foreigners
who buy things.

215
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:09,965
Yes, but there are also
foreigners who come back.

216
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:14,789
Why do you laugh?

217
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:18,413
Because it’s bothering you.

218
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:21,587
- We are beyond reproach.
- I didn’t ask you anything.

219
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:25,252
You know everything anyway.
The murderers were beheaded.

220
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:29,247
And quite convenient it was,
wasn’t it?

221
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:31,230
Their footprints were the ones
we found in La Burlière.

222
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,897
Their shoes and trousers legs
were bloody.

223
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,615
They even stole Monge’s brandy.
We found them drunk on it.

224
00:20:35,616 --> 00:20:37,688
What more do you want?

225
00:20:37,689 --> 00:20:39,834
At the foot of the gallows, they were
still screaming that they were innocent.

226
00:20:39,835 --> 00:20:41,226
That’s what they all scream.

227
00:20:41,227 --> 00:20:43,343
And those screamed
in a foreign language.

228
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:46,303
- We couldn’t understand them.
- How very convenient.

229
00:20:46,338 --> 00:20:47,796
We don’t have anything
more to tell you.

230
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:50,807
You don’t have anything to look
for here. Except sadness and pain.

231
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:52,847
I don’t care: I don’t have
a penny, so I’m not afraid.

232
00:20:52,848 --> 00:20:55,511
But since they’ve become rich,
they don’t like being bothered.

233
00:20:55,512 --> 00:20:56,864
You mustn’t listen to morons.

234
00:20:58,093 --> 00:21:00,583
The culprits were punished,
the case is now forgotten.

235
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:03,947
Séraphin.
Go and dance. Go.

236
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:07,000
Let bygones be bygones, and the
young must stay with the young.

237
00:21:09,927 --> 00:21:14,465
I should know. The owner
of the oil mill, Didon Pujol,

238
00:21:14,466 --> 00:21:18,867
almost bought La Burlière for
a song, but his wife told him...

239
00:21:18,868 --> 00:21:21,150
...if you buy it, you’ll live
there alone.

240
00:21:21,151 --> 00:21:24,925
I’ll never set foot in it. She was
scared of meeting a ghost.

241
00:21:24,926 --> 00:21:29,301
She was right. Every night, the
mother comes back for her kid.

242
00:21:30,264 --> 00:21:32,366
- But I don’t know how to dance.
- I’m going to teach you.

243
00:21:36,098 --> 00:21:38,615
One, two, three...

244
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:43,020
Look at him dancing. He spoiled
our party with his evil eye.

245
00:21:52,848 --> 00:21:57,454
You waited for me? How nice!
You shouldn’t have.

246
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,959
My bread. Give me my bread.

247
00:22:08,281 --> 00:22:12,729
Hey: he’s not afraid.
That’s because he’s new here.

248
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,712
Although this is his home, isn’t it?
Whatever some people may say.

249
00:22:16,713 --> 00:22:20,457
Thank you, Séraphin, my boy.

250
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,904
Thank you.

251
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:27,786
No, thank you. I never eat garlic.
They say it’s bad...

252
00:22:27,787 --> 00:22:30,530
for people like me.

253
00:22:33,662 --> 00:22:36,605
An excellent bread,
Célestat Dormeur.

254
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:39,693
Better than last year.

255
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,119
Probably your sweated fear
that fell into the dough:

256
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,206
it enhances the taste.
Mmm... A little on the exotic side.

257
00:22:49,673 --> 00:22:53,134
So, Séraphin Monge, are you happy
to be in your village again?

258
00:22:53,135 --> 00:22:55,727
As you can see, we’re having fun,
we’re celebrating.

259
00:22:55,728 --> 00:22:58,151
We’re so happy to see you.

260
00:22:58,152 --> 00:23:00,216
We’re your family now.

261
00:23:00,217 --> 00:23:03,631
Even if some thought it was
smart to tell you things...

262
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,855
To wake up the dead.

263
00:23:05,856 --> 00:23:08,079
You mustn’t, you must never
wake up the dead.

264
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,294
It can be hazardous.
Sometimes.

265
00:23:13,295 --> 00:23:15,918
<i>I started being feverish
on the next day...</i>

266
00:23:23,507 --> 00:23:26,539
- Brigue!
- I knew you’d come.

267
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,655
What is it? Are you ill?

268
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:31,584
I wouldn’t be like this if
I hadn’t told you anything.

269
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,471
The Spanish flu, they say.
Easy to say, isn’t it?

270
00:23:36,472 --> 00:23:38,990
The Devil’s flu, I say.

271
00:23:38,991 --> 00:23:43,382
Come what may, I do not
regret telling you.

272
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:49,350
But remember: it couldn’t
have happened that way.

273
00:23:49,351 --> 00:23:52,280
- Why do you say that?
- The attorney said it:

274
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:56,122
to inflict such wounds,
there’s only one tool:

275
00:23:56,123 --> 00:23:59,387
a cobbler’s knife.
A well-sharpened cobbler’s knife.

276
00:23:59,388 --> 00:24:04,843
And on the three guys from Herzegovina,
they found no cobbler’s knife.

277
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:11,387
Anyway you can find those
tools here, not in Herzegovina.

278
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,219
Tell me about my mother.
What was she like?

279
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,986
I’m talking about the murderers.
Can’t you understand?

280
00:24:18,987 --> 00:24:22,108
- They don’t exist anymore.
- Don’t they?

281
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:25,644
Since you talked to me,
I have nightmares...

282
00:24:25,645 --> 00:24:31,188
I can see bits and pieces...
the house, my father... a cradle.

283
00:24:32,449 --> 00:24:36,011
But I never see faces.
How was my mother?

284
00:24:36,012 --> 00:24:39,069
Very beautiful.

285
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:45,046
There was a portrait of her in
La Burlière, but I... well, it disappeared.

286
00:24:46,613 --> 00:24:48,575
Oh, beware, kid.

287
00:24:48,576 --> 00:24:52,366
The dead always try to cling to you,
to insert themselves in your life,

288
00:24:52,367 --> 00:25:00,750
in order to finish what they
must do. Beware, kid. Beware.

289
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:05,725
Clorinde. Hey, Clorinde!
Come and see.

290
00:25:05,726 --> 00:25:10,360
Listen for one minute.
Clorinde. Hey, Clorinde!

291
00:25:10,361 --> 00:25:12,848
Don’t you scream that way.
Célestat is napping.

292
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:15,799
I want to see you, Clorinde.
Séraphin Monge is mad:

293
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,296
- he’s burning his furniture.
- What are you saying?

294
00:25:18,297 --> 00:25:20,687
He’s up there, in La Burlière.
Burning everything.

295
00:25:20,688 --> 00:25:23,410
I saw him: I was picking up
marjoram for Brigue’s fever.

296
00:25:23,411 --> 00:25:26,329
And do you know what? He was trying
to break the table with a sledge hammer.

297
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:28,657
And the dough trough was
burning in the fire.

298
00:25:28,658 --> 00:25:32,786
Marie! What are you doing?
Where are you going?

299
00:25:32,787 --> 00:25:36,649
- Where is she going?
- You know where she’s going.

300
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:39,152
That girl is crazy, I can’t
understand her.

301
00:25:55,343 --> 00:25:57,007
No, not that!

302
00:25:57,008 --> 00:25:59,666
Mind your own business.
Go away!

303
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:00,939
Hey, look now, do you
know who I am?

304
00:26:00,974 --> 00:26:02,828
Yes, you’re the baker’s daughter.
Get out, I tell you.

305
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:05,872
- No one ever talked to me like that.
- I’m talking the way I can.

306
00:26:05,873 --> 00:26:07,723
You must never burn a cradle,
it’s bad luck.

307
00:26:07,724 --> 00:26:10,162
- And where will your children sleep?
- I’ll never have children.

308
00:26:10,163 --> 00:26:12,149
- I want some.
- Who’s preventing you?

309
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,679
You. You love another girl.

310
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,648
I’m not here to love anybody.

311
00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:18,258
All my life, I’ve been looking
for a family.

312
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:19,891
The trouble is that, now, I found it.

313
00:26:19,892 --> 00:26:21,561
And I don’t want to talk about it.

314
00:26:22,464 --> 00:26:24,943
I can’t believe it. There are no more
men here, they’ve all gone.

315
00:26:24,944 --> 00:26:26,241
And the only one who comes back
thinks only of the dead.

316
00:26:26,242 --> 00:26:27,844
Didn’t you see enough dead
during the war?

317
00:26:27,845 --> 00:26:28,768
Leave me alone.

318
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:32,003
If I were a man, I would forbid
you to do all this.

319
00:26:32,004 --> 00:26:33,788
You have no right.
You have no right!

320
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:35,861
What do you know about
what right I have or don’t have?

321
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:37,199
Do you know the sight I’ve got
before my eyes?

322
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,320
Do you know why I’m burning it all?

323
00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:40,508
Do you know that my mother crawls
to my cradle every night,

324
00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:42,211
without ever reaching it?
Do you know that?

325
00:26:42,212 --> 00:26:43,671
You’re hurting me.

326
00:26:43,672 --> 00:26:45,098
If only Brigue didn’t tell me anything.

327
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:46,962
If only I could believe that
she died like anybody.

328
00:26:46,963 --> 00:26:49,809
And I can’t even avenge her:
someone did it for me.

329
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:53,540
You’re hurting me.

330
00:26:55,968 --> 00:26:58,370
- What...?
- Shhh.

331
00:27:01,396 --> 00:27:02,961
I thought somebody
was spying on us.

332
00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:07,553
- I didn’t hear anything.
- It’s because I’m always alert.

333
00:27:07,554 --> 00:27:10,201
War gives you the habit.

334
00:27:24,907 --> 00:27:27,662
<i>That was the day Old Brigue
died of the Spanish flu.</i>

335
00:27:27,663 --> 00:27:32,263
The Spanish flu.
Easy to say, isn’t it?

336
00:27:45,427 --> 00:27:49,295
<i>Then one day, there was no more
fire nor smoke in La Burlière.</i>

337
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:37,044
Is it over?

338
00:28:44,544 --> 00:28:46,743
- No.
- It is: you burned everything.

339
00:28:46,744 --> 00:28:50,583
No. The house agrees with me.

340
00:28:50,584 --> 00:28:52,766
It knows it must disappear.

341
00:28:59,466 --> 00:29:00,890
- This is not your place.
- Let me pass.

342
00:29:00,891 --> 00:29:02,014
I tell you this is not your place.

343
00:29:02,015 --> 00:29:05,070
Leave him alone, he’s too miserable.
And he’ll never love anybody anyway.

344
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:07,219
You didn’t know how to manage him.
Now it’s my turn to try.

345
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,685
You didn’t understand, did you?

346
00:29:08,686 --> 00:29:11,163
He doesn’t have to choose between
you and me but between the house and us.

347
00:29:11,164 --> 00:29:13,566
I’m going.

348
00:29:41,198 --> 00:29:45,387
Rose. I’ve been told you’ve been seen
again stopping to talk to the road-mender.

349
00:29:45,388 --> 00:29:47,708
- He’s got a name.
- I don’t want to hear his name.

350
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:49,175
He’s been here for as long
as we have.

351
00:29:49,176 --> 00:29:51,536
If his parents hadn’t been killed,
he would be as good as we are.

352
00:29:51,537 --> 00:29:53,328
Let this be clear, Rose:

353
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:55,312
I don’t want the road-mender
to hang around you.

354
00:29:55,313 --> 00:29:56,482
He doesn’t hang. I do.

355
00:29:56,483 --> 00:29:59,179
And I really wonder why you don’t
want me to talk to Séraphin.

356
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,906
Would you think it immoral
if I married a handsome man?

357
00:30:01,907 --> 00:30:04,543
This Séraphin certainly
won’t want to marry you.

358
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,233
- What do you know about that?
- I saw him talking to Marie Dormeur.

359
00:30:07,234 --> 00:30:09,439
You’ve seen Marie Dormeur talking
to him, that’s not the same.

360
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,851
No, he was talking to her,
I tell you.

361
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:12,995
- And he was telling her a lot,
believe me. - Enough.

362
00:30:12,996 --> 00:30:15,850
We don’t know anything
about the boy anyway.

363
00:30:15,851 --> 00:30:17,667
Except that he was born
in the blood of his family

364
00:30:17,668 --> 00:30:20,180
then went through the war in
the blood of others, without a scratch.

365
00:30:20,181 --> 00:30:22,324
I say a black star is protecting him.

366
00:30:22,325 --> 00:30:24,781
I’ve got nothing against him
but I don’t want him in my home.

367
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:27,808
That’s why you put his name on the
war memorial. It suited you, didn’t it?

368
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:31,303
It didn’t suit me at all.
And now shut up.

369
00:30:33,404 --> 00:30:38,137
Marie. You were seen talking to
the road-mender. That is not proper.

370
00:30:38,138 --> 00:30:40,045
- Why?
- Because.

371
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,223
Oh, fine: there are no more men
because of the war,

372
00:30:42,224 --> 00:30:43,790
why don’t you forbid her
to see those who are left?

373
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:45,381
- A road-mender.
- So what?

374
00:30:45,382 --> 00:30:46,714
If there were no road-menders
there wouldn’t be any roads,

375
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:48,171
and I couldn’t go and sell
your bread.

376
00:30:48,172 --> 00:30:49,556
Don’t you raise your voice
in front of me.

377
00:30:49,557 --> 00:30:52,951
He’s a good kid, he works hard
and he’s beautiful as a star.

378
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:54,880
What do you know of what
is beautiful or not?

379
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:56,388
True: we’re too old.

380
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:59,175
Séraphin Monge is not beautiful.
He’s miserable.

381
00:30:59,176 --> 00:31:02,031
That’s just it: one shouldn’t
consort with misery.

382
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:03,823
Misery is catching.
Just like the scabies.

383
00:31:05,326 --> 00:31:08,135
And if you say again the name of the
road-mender, you can leave the table.

384
00:31:08,136 --> 00:31:10,221
<i>My father didn’t say
another word that evening.</i>

385
00:31:10,222 --> 00:31:13,587
<i>He worried so much it killed his
appetite. I’d never seen him like that.</i>

386
00:31:13,588 --> 00:31:19,315
<i>And very early one morning, as I
got up from bed, I saw them talking.</i>

387
00:31:19,316 --> 00:31:22,862
<i>That was a strange sight:
the baker and the miller.</i>

388
00:31:22,863 --> 00:31:25,248
<i>That was the first time I saw them
exchanging more than three words.</i>

389
00:31:27,182 --> 00:31:29,360
<i>Now Séraphin was
demolishing his house.</i>

390
00:31:30,783 --> 00:31:33,262
Go.

391
00:31:48,321 --> 00:31:50,516
<i>All the idlers in the village
came to see the madman.</i>

392
00:32:00,933 --> 00:32:03,166
Hey! Hey, Crazy!

393
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:07,207
Since you’re so comfortable up
there, you might just stay there.

394
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:10,406
Come on, guys.
Come on, come on.

395
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:20,212
He’s going to see what will
happen to him.

396
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:21,652
- Yeah!
- All right, guys.

397
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:24,163
Now let’s show him, OK?
Let’s aim for his head.

398
00:32:24,164 --> 00:32:29,076
Take this, Crazy.
Here, take this.

399
00:32:32,883 --> 00:32:37,051
Put the ladder back up immediately
or I behead you with this whip.

400
00:32:54,077 --> 00:32:56,566
OK, guys, let’s split.

401
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:17,778
Yes. There’s a painter doing this kind
of thing now. His name is Picasso.

402
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:19,797
I could model for him.

403
00:33:21,525 --> 00:33:23,151
Fortunately, I kept my buttocks,

404
00:33:23,152 --> 00:33:25,960
so with a piece of them,
they made me a shoulder and...

405
00:33:25,961 --> 00:33:28,242
Thank you. Without you,
I would have slept up there.

406
00:33:28,243 --> 00:33:30,273
At least you would have
looked ridiculous.

407
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,827
And I didn’t want you
to look ridiculous.

408
00:33:32,828 --> 00:33:35,615
My name is Patrice Dupin.

409
00:33:35,616 --> 00:33:37,663
- I’m Séra...
- Yeah, I know, yeah.

410
00:33:37,664 --> 00:33:40,871
- Apparently you got out of it all right.
- Apparently.

411
00:33:40,872 --> 00:33:45,687
- Do you still think of it?
- Of the war? Never.

412
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:49,223
Yeah. You’ve got other things
on your mind.

413
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:52,834
Funny. You’re the first person who
doesn’t ask me why I’m doing this.

414
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:56,251
Doing what?

415
00:33:57,345 --> 00:33:59,520
To each his broken mug.

416
00:34:01,034 --> 00:34:03,378
They’ve shattered yours inside.

417
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:05,381
Why are you so formal with me?

418
00:34:05,382 --> 00:34:06,662
I’ve been familiar with
enough men during the war.

419
00:34:06,663 --> 00:34:08,054
It didn’t do them any good.

420
00:34:10,152 --> 00:34:12,709
I don’t have friends
anymore either.

421
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:19,414
Come and see me. It’s on the
Courcelles way. It’s called Pontradieu.

422
00:34:19,415 --> 00:34:23,825
My father bought a house there.
Well... a castle rather.

423
00:34:23,826 --> 00:34:26,888
He’s playing the aristocrat.

424
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:29,425
You’ll see, it’s funny enough.

425
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:48,112
Madam! Good morning.

426
00:34:48,113 --> 00:34:52,644
Tell me: there was a farm called
La Burlière around here, wasn’t it?

427
00:34:52,645 --> 00:34:54,119
There was.

428
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,281
In the old days, it was an inn,
a coaching inn?

429
00:34:57,282 --> 00:35:00,729
Am I right?
Can you show me the way?

430
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:03,881
There’s no more way.
There’s no more house.

431
00:35:08,347 --> 00:35:11,794
My name is Margoulite.
Joseph.

432
00:35:12,941 --> 00:35:15,589
I came here about 25 years ago.

433
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,948
I can remember it as if it
were yesterday.

434
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:22,253
I came from Jura.
I was a journeyman.

435
00:35:22,254 --> 00:35:24,343
That was the time of
my journey around France.

436
00:35:24,344 --> 00:35:27,712
Yes. I went far since then.

437
00:35:27,713 --> 00:35:32,230
But I’ll tell you one thing:
money doesn’t replace the road.

438
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:34,656
I can still see the house.

439
00:35:35,711 --> 00:35:37,687
We must not talk about it anymore.

440
00:35:37,688 --> 00:35:41,951
There was a crime in La Burlière.
It’s a cursed place.

441
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,791
I can well imagine that.

442
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:46,304
Especially since they’ve
guillotined three innocent men.

443
00:35:46,305 --> 00:35:48,856
- Why do you say that?
- I was there on the night of the crime.

444
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:52,161
To think that I walked
all these miles then.

445
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:56,215
- Why do you come here?
- I’m a builder.

446
00:35:56,216 --> 00:36:01,016
I built a house on the other bank
of the Gouard, for Parisians.

447
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:07,272
I’ve been told that...
Well, I learnt that...

448
00:36:07,273 --> 00:36:10,561
- that he was back?
- Séraphin?

449
00:36:10,562 --> 00:36:12,796
He won’t stay long.

450
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:14,548
Is it true that he’s wrecking
his house?

451
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:16,791
What do you want of him?

452
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:19,974
If he’s doing such a thing, it means
it’s still eating him. Just like me.

453
00:36:19,975 --> 00:36:22,686
I was right to come.

454
00:36:22,687 --> 00:36:25,183
But one shouldn’t avenge himself
on houses but on men.

455
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:27,565
I’m going to tell him the truth.

456
00:36:27,566 --> 00:36:30,813
- The truth? What truth?
The truth is known. - No!

457
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:40,783
- Hey!
- Yes?

458
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:45,146
Now, what a mess!
It feels funny.

459
00:36:45,147 --> 00:36:49,482
I’m saying this because I’m in the trade.
You’re wrecking, I’m building.

460
00:36:49,483 --> 00:36:51,880
If you want stones,
just help yourself.

461
00:36:51,881 --> 00:36:57,023
Oh! To think it was such
a beautiful house 25 years ago.

462
00:36:57,024 --> 00:36:58,894
- 25 years ago?
- Indeed.

463
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:22,935
I never could forget that night.
I never could talk about it.

464
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,059
I was eighteen.

465
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,235
I was covered in blood and I thought
the police would accuse me.

466
00:37:29,236 --> 00:37:32,779
That’s why I ran away.

467
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:42,074
I hid for ten days in the
mountains. With fear.

468
00:37:45,517 --> 00:37:47,493
And the three men?
Did you see them?

469
00:37:47,494 --> 00:37:50,549
I saw the three men, yes.
Before I got here.

470
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,734
I had been walking for two days.

471
00:37:52,735 --> 00:37:55,422
On the bend, just after Les Mays,
there’s a spring.

472
00:37:55,423 --> 00:37:58,041
A spring level with the ground.

473
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:02,648
I drank from it, then I fell asleep.

474
00:38:02,649 --> 00:38:05,616
I don’t know what woke me up.

475
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:08,880
<i>The noise. The voices maybe.</i>

476
00:38:08,881 --> 00:38:12,439
- How shall we make him tell.
- There are many ways.

477
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,839
- Monge has a stone for a heart.
- If we’re seen...

478
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,623
We won’t be. The three of us
will cover for each other.

479
00:38:19,624 --> 00:38:24,166
Can you see this stone? My grandfather
already sharpened his knife on it.

480
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:27,670
- Do you think we’ll need it?
- If we do, it will be sharp enough.

481
00:38:27,671 --> 00:38:30,679
And when you arrived here,
didn’t you tell my father?

482
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,970
- Didn’t you warn him?
- How could I?

483
00:38:32,971 --> 00:38:35,776
I didn’t make the connection.
And I was hungry, that’s all.

484
00:38:35,777 --> 00:38:39,263
And I came from Jura.
Monge, I didn’t know who that was.

485
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:43,863
Wait. How could you understand
what the three men said?

486
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:46,856
- They were foreigners.
- Not at all.

487
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,557
They were speaking just like
you and I, people from here.

488
00:38:49,558 --> 00:38:53,311
But that's not important.

489
00:38:53,312 --> 00:38:55,582
On the contrary,
it’s very important.

490
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:05,252
What about the other?
The one who wasn’t masked.

491
00:39:05,253 --> 00:39:07,293
What did he look like?
How tall? How old?

492
00:39:08,352 --> 00:39:10,408
Truth is not that simple to tell.

493
00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:13,466
When I came to La Burlière,

494
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:16,258
I could see I was
interrupting something.

495
00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:19,003
That there was
a storm inside too.

496
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,763
As soon as I finished my soup, one
of your brothers took me to my bed.

497
00:39:22,764 --> 00:39:27,339
He lifted a trapdoor and
I found myself in the stables.

498
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:31,292
I fell asleep like a log... Not for long:
some noises woke me up.

499
00:39:31,293 --> 00:39:35,648
I was thirsty. I told myself:
you’re going to bother them but,

500
00:39:35,649 --> 00:39:38,243
what the hell, you’ve got
to drink, haven’t you?

501
00:39:38,244 --> 00:39:41,574
So I lifted the trapdoor...

502
00:39:41,575 --> 00:39:44,285
and I saw.
It was blood.

503
00:39:44,286 --> 00:39:48,249
But at the same time, I saw a mass
of skirts, blouse and hair, and an arm

504
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:52,638
reaching for your cradle. It almost made it
but, just before it did, fell down again.

505
00:39:54,311 --> 00:40:00,230
- And then she died.
- I know. She was my mother.

506
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:04,872
Yeah.

507
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:08,738
- Séraphin! Watch out!
- Mind the stones

508
00:40:10,761 --> 00:40:12,770
Leave me alone.

509
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:14,925
Don’t listen to what he said.
Forget him.

510
00:40:14,926 --> 00:40:16,888
You must live. You’ll be happy.

511
00:40:16,889 --> 00:40:21,232
Zorme... The killers.
He said they were from here.

512
00:40:21,233 --> 00:40:23,210
What did he know about it?

513
00:40:24,012 --> 00:40:26,378
- What about you?
- He came to throw poison into your life.

514
00:40:26,379 --> 00:40:29,618
The house killed him to protect you.
Can you hear me?

515
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:31,844
If you believe what
he said, you’re lost.

516
00:40:31,845 --> 00:40:35,119
- Lost!
- Wait!

517
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,455
Forget everything. It’s the demon
wanting to take you back.

518
00:40:38,456 --> 00:40:42,454
Don’t let him.
Forget!

519
00:40:42,455 --> 00:40:45,702
What a fate, by God.
To end like that.

520
00:40:45,703 --> 00:40:48,289
A man whose job was
building houses.

521
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:50,237
I saw one he built in Peyrolles.

522
00:40:50,238 --> 00:40:53,444
A monstrosity. It looked like
a soup tureen.

523
00:40:56,644 --> 00:40:59,924
- What did he tell Séraphin?
- Nothing.

524
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:02,132
He came to buy the stones
of La Burlière.

525
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:05,252
- The house didn’t want it.
- The house, easy to say.

526
00:41:05,253 --> 00:41:07,471
I’ve got to see if the other one
didn’t say a word.

527
00:41:07,472 --> 00:41:09,487
As for Séraphin, he lost his head.

528
00:41:09,488 --> 00:41:12,329
He’s the violent kind.
He’s not normal.

529
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:15,406
No, Celestat, no. I was there.
I saw it all.

530
00:41:15,407 --> 00:41:18,620
He didn’t tell Séraphin anything.
He didn’t have the time.

531
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:25,252
My mother. My family.
Three guillotined innocent men.

532
00:41:25,253 --> 00:41:26,903
And that man who didn’t do
anything to you.

533
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:30,774
You bitch! Bitch! Bitch!

534
00:41:30,775 --> 00:41:33,040
But I’ll get you. I’ll go to the end.

535
00:41:33,041 --> 00:41:37,385
Nothing will remain.
Nothing! Nothing, nothing

536
00:41:59,275 --> 00:42:02,935
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

537
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:11,623
- Séraphin!
- We brought you gifts.

538
00:42:11,624 --> 00:42:14,351
- Olives from my father’s mill.
- And choux buns baked this morning.

539
00:42:14,352 --> 00:42:16,591
Thank you, but don’t stay here.
It’s dangerous.

540
00:42:16,592 --> 00:42:20,383
And I’ve got to work. To take advantage
of my Sunday. I don’t have much time.

541
00:42:32,178 --> 00:42:33,972
I told you we shouldn’t have
come together.

542
00:42:33,973 --> 00:42:36,428
He can be so nice when you
see him alone.

543
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,677
Why didn’t you come alone,
as you did the other day?

544
00:42:38,678 --> 00:42:41,532
I don’t have to justify
myself to you.

545
00:42:52,514 --> 00:42:55,332
- Patrice...
- Shhh. I’m dreaming.

546
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:58,572
She looked right at my face,
and she didn’t lower her eyes.

547
00:42:58,573 --> 00:43:03,332
She... She smiled at me.

548
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,555
- Which one?
- Well, the Persian one.

549
00:43:05,556 --> 00:43:07,980
Well... the one who
looks like she’s Persian.

550
00:43:07,981 --> 00:43:12,059
- Persian? Are you sure?
- I don’t know.

551
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:15,706
That’s how I picture them.

552
00:43:16,706 --> 00:43:18,617
- Are you weeping?
- Yes.

553
00:43:20,457 --> 00:43:24,473
That’s one thing I can do.
Weeping.

554
00:43:24,474 --> 00:43:26,947
Here, take the olives.
She brought them to me.

555
00:43:29,645 --> 00:43:31,481
I’ll put them under
a glass globe.

556
00:43:32,685 --> 00:43:34,450
At least eat the choux buns
of the other one.

557
00:43:34,451 --> 00:43:38,041
- What about you?
- What could I do with these?

558
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:40,497
You eat choux buns
when you’re happy.

559
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:47,137
If I only could rub out my face
the way you wreck your house.

560
00:43:49,148 --> 00:43:51,088
I’m not just going to raze
the house to the ground.

561
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:54,112
I’m going to find the killers.
The real ones.

562
00:43:54,113 --> 00:43:58,760
25 years later? Who knows
what became of them?

563
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,631
What with the war,
are they even alive?

564
00:44:02,746 --> 00:44:04,768
If they were dead, I’d know it.

565
00:44:06,069 --> 00:44:08,541
I’d know it.

566
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:23,418
<i>How could my father
earn all of this?</i>

567
00:45:25,251 --> 00:45:31,912
<i>1892, June 1th. Gaspard Dupin,
Didon Pujol, Célestat Dormeur</i>

568
00:45:31,913 --> 00:45:35,844
<i>hereby declare owing to
Mr. Félicien Monge</i>

569
00:45:35,845 --> 00:45:41,070
<i>1500... 1000... 1200...</i>

570
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:45,086
<i>With 1000 francs, then,
you could buy 10 hectares here.</i>

571
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:49,198
<i>An interest of 23% will be collected...</i>

572
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:54,884
<i>23%. 1000 F at 23%. That was
enough to want a man dead.</i>

573
00:45:54,885 --> 00:46:01,413
<i>To be paid back to Mr. Félicien Monge
on St Michael’s day, in the year 1896.</i>

574
00:46:01,414 --> 00:46:04,852
<i>The night of the crime...
it was the eve of St Michael’s day.</i>

575
00:46:04,853 --> 00:46:10,381
<i>Three debts. Three men from here.
Dupin, Pujol, Dormeur...</i>

576
00:46:10,382 --> 00:46:12,880
Good morning, Mr. Dormeur.
Good morning, Mr. Dormeur.

577
00:46:12,881 --> 00:46:15,707
- Mr. Dormeur.
- The owner of the oil mill,

578
00:46:15,708 --> 00:46:18,883
Didon Pujol...
Didon Pujol... Pujol...

579
00:46:18,884 --> 00:46:22,284
I don’t want you to be ridiculous.
My name is Patrice Dupin.

580
00:46:22,285 --> 00:46:24,715
My name is Patrice Dupin.
Patrice Dupin.

581
00:46:24,716 --> 00:46:29,259
<i>Dupin the rich man, Pujol the miller,
Dormeur the baker.</i>

582
00:46:35,774 --> 00:46:38,122
Hello, sir.

583
00:46:47,475 --> 00:46:49,586
Good morning.

584
00:46:52,605 --> 00:46:53,629
Do you want bread?

585
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,382
No, I just wanted to thank
your father for the choux buns.

586
00:46:56,383 --> 00:46:59,749
They were delicious.

587
00:47:00,575 --> 00:47:04,062
Good morning, Mr. Dormeur.

588
00:47:04,063 --> 00:47:06,500
See you soon, Marie.

589
00:47:27,224 --> 00:47:29,974
- Good morning.
- What’s happening to you?

590
00:47:29,975 --> 00:47:31,303
This is the first time you've
come to the mill.

591
00:47:31,304 --> 00:47:34,368
Yes. I come to thank
your father for the olives.

592
00:47:34,369 --> 00:47:37,560
- They were delicious.
- Somebody changed him! He talks!

593
00:47:43,809 --> 00:47:46,496
We’d better go. My father
doesn’t like you much.

594
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:49,207
- Doesn’t he? Why?
- You’re bad luck.

595
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:51,607
Since you’ve been here,
he says his oil is brown.

596
00:48:00,883 --> 00:48:02,735
You’ll see: there are charming
things in Pontradieu.

597
00:48:02,736 --> 00:48:04,671
- I’m sure of it.
- I’m counting on you then?

598
00:48:04,672 --> 00:48:08,479
Agreed. On Sunday for lunch.
Thank your father for me.

599
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,257
If it’s all the same to you,
I’d rather surprise him.

600
00:48:10,258 --> 00:48:13,879
- That’s it. We’ll surprise him.
- Bye!

601
00:48:41,871 --> 00:48:43,915
Séraphin, what are you doing?

602
00:48:43,916 --> 00:48:46,979
Where were you? I almost thought
you would let me down.

603
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,666
- I was looking at the pond.
- Did you see it?

604
00:48:49,667 --> 00:48:51,796
My father’s pride and joy.

605
00:48:51,797 --> 00:48:53,415
Every day, he takes his
ritual walk here,

606
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:57,710
even when he comes back home late.
He’s got to walk round his pond.

607
00:48:57,711 --> 00:49:01,029
Come. Here, we eat at noon.

608
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:04,501
My mother is already seated
at the table.

609
00:49:10,022 --> 00:49:13,909
Oh, so you’re Séraphin Monge.
So it’s you?

610
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:19,532
If I had thought, my God.
If they’d told me that, one day...

611
00:49:19,533 --> 00:49:23,972
- She’s as deaf as a post.
- Yes, but she’s alive.

612
00:49:23,973 --> 00:49:27,173
She never heard me
laugh nor cry.

613
00:49:28,911 --> 00:49:31,467
My father married her because
she was an heiress.

614
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:35,124
- Isn’t your father here?
- No, he’s in Marseille.

615
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:37,772
That’s him, yes.
Don’t you think I look like him?

616
00:49:39,251 --> 00:49:42,098
Sit down.

617
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:45,444
- Is he rich?
- Very.

618
00:49:45,445 --> 00:49:49,584
First my mother’s money.
Although he had a long wait.

619
00:49:49,585 --> 00:49:52,975
- How long?
- The inheritance?

620
00:49:52,976 --> 00:49:55,790
It was around 1900.
I was about ten.

621
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:58,297
- So I was four.
- Well, yes.

622
00:49:58,298 --> 00:50:00,841
- It seems to trouble you.
- No, no.

623
00:50:02,647 --> 00:50:06,464
- So, when I was born, he was poor?
- He couldn’t know.

624
00:50:08,308 --> 00:50:10,337
Then there was the war.

625
00:50:10,338 --> 00:50:15,580
A good thing when you’re
a blacksmith. A very very good thing.

626
00:50:15,581 --> 00:50:18,267
First horseshoes, then shells.

627
00:50:18,268 --> 00:50:21,587
He made as many as were
raining on us.

628
00:50:21,588 --> 00:50:24,532
It was profitable.

629
00:50:24,533 --> 00:50:27,020
As many millions as I have pieces
instead of a face.

630
00:50:27,021 --> 00:50:28,736
Except that when he saw me
coming back like this,

631
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:31,815
he wanted to give them back,
of course. His millions.

632
00:50:31,816 --> 00:50:33,880
But he didn’t know to whom.

633
00:50:35,431 --> 00:50:38,854
Oh: Charmaine, my sister.

634
00:50:48,023 --> 00:50:50,718
Her husband was killed
in October 1917.

635
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:54,866
Isn’t it a sin: such an arse,
only used for sitting on it.

636
00:50:54,867 --> 00:50:56,924
Stop it, Patrice.

637
00:50:56,925 --> 00:50:59,559
I’m warning you: if you don’t like her,
we won’t stay friends.

638
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,671
Sit down. I wouldn’t like you
to get taller.

639
00:51:02,672 --> 00:51:06,431
- Oh, father is not here?
- No. He won’t be back till tonight.

640
00:51:06,432 --> 00:51:08,302
Conchita changed her day.

641
00:51:08,303 --> 00:51:10,240
And how much will she take
from him today?

642
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:12,680
As long as he doesn’t
get her pregnant.

643
00:51:12,681 --> 00:51:15,038
Someone could do it for him.

644
00:51:16,855 --> 00:51:19,255
You don’t mind us revealing
our dirty family secrets, do you?

645
00:51:19,256 --> 00:51:21,415
It’s always a good start
for a conversation.

646
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:24,558
The guest is terribly embarrassed,
so he quickly changes subjects.

647
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,750
You’ll have to get used to it:
he’s not the talking type.

648
00:51:28,751 --> 00:51:31,438
I wouldn’t mind if he’d
at least agree to see me.

649
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:36,494
The armchair you seem to admire
is genuine Louis the Xlllth.

650
00:51:36,495 --> 00:51:38,536
We’ve got another one
in my bedroom.

651
00:51:38,537 --> 00:51:41,513
I’ll show it to you later if you
express the desire to see it.

652
00:51:43,483 --> 00:51:46,869
Tell me, you know the girl I saw
one Sunday in La Burlière...

653
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:50,048
- Which one?
- On, you know.

654
00:51:50,049 --> 00:51:51,321
The one who smiled at me
and said hello.

655
00:51:51,322 --> 00:51:53,457
- Oh, the Persian?
- The Persian.

656
00:51:53,458 --> 00:51:56,037
- She’s Rose Pujol.
- Oh, Rose.

657
00:51:56,038 --> 00:51:59,404
- Do you see her sometimes?
- I meet her.

658
00:51:59,405 --> 00:52:04,523
If you see her, can you tell her,
er... nothing.

659
00:52:04,524 --> 00:52:09,171
- You see? You don’t tell her anything.
- I won’t fail to do it.

660
00:52:18,145 --> 00:52:21,723
- Well... I’ve got to go.
- I’ll walk him to the gate.

661
00:52:21,724 --> 00:52:24,554
Come and see us again.
Seeing you make me feel good.

662
00:52:24,555 --> 00:52:28,275
I have no friends and...
I don’t want any.

663
00:52:28,276 --> 00:52:31,893
Going out, cruising around,
laughing...

664
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:34,924
when I laugh, people
are frightened.

665
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:39,916
Well.. with you, I know I don’t have
to fear anything on that account.

666
00:52:39,917 --> 00:52:42,133
No, with me, you don’t have
to fear anything.

667
00:52:42,134 --> 00:52:45,255
And what do I have to fear?

668
00:52:53,672 --> 00:52:56,775
- So there’s a Rose in your life?
- No, there’s no one in my life.

669
00:52:56,776 --> 00:52:59,694
How long will you keep on
not seeing me?

670
00:52:59,695 --> 00:53:01,806
- I’m a road-mender, I...
- So what?

671
00:53:01,807 --> 00:53:05,366
Does it prevent you from living?
Or are you looking for an excuse?

672
00:53:06,222 --> 00:53:08,630
Take this.

673
00:53:09,496 --> 00:53:12,170
It opens the small gate near
the pond, and the back door

674
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:14,150
which opens on the big corridor.

675
00:53:14,151 --> 00:53:17,561
My bedroom is the first door
on the right.

676
00:53:17,596 --> 00:53:19,861
I’ll wait for you as long
as I have to.

677
00:53:21,044 --> 00:53:23,789
Let’s not disappoint my brother:
he wanted us to meet.

678
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,913
I wouldn’t hurt him for the world.

679
00:53:32,481 --> 00:53:35,128
Neither would you.

680
00:54:14,426 --> 00:54:16,619
And don’t you forget:
feed them yourself.

681
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:20,499
Every night, because if you don’t...
they won’t recognize even you.

682
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,499
Goodbye, Mr. Dupin.

683
00:54:27,843 --> 00:54:29,165
You’re looking for trouble.

684
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:31,589
Those animals are more dangerous
than a loaded rifle.

685
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:36,471
That’s the point. I want them to be
dangerous, and I want people to know it.

686
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:39,295
I’ve been thinking of this,
wanting this for a long time.

687
00:54:39,296 --> 00:54:43,271
Conchita’s father is raising them.
I knew them as pups.

688
00:54:43,272 --> 00:54:45,311
They obey my slightest command.

689
00:54:45,312 --> 00:54:48,488
These dogs can kill a man
in utter silence.

690
00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:52,942
To kill... Do you even know
what it is to kill?

691
00:55:01,222 --> 00:55:03,287
- He came here.
- Who?

692
00:55:03,288 --> 00:55:04,888
The road-mender.

693
00:55:04,889 --> 00:55:07,559
If you mean Séraphin Monge,
that’s true: he came here.

694
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,568
- I can smell him.
- You never saw him.

695
00:55:10,569 --> 00:55:13,695
I don’t need to see him.
I know where he’s been.

696
00:55:14,695 --> 00:55:18,382
He came for lunch. And he
talked to Miss Charmaine.

697
00:55:18,383 --> 00:55:20,759
I don’t want your sister
to talk to him.

698
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:23,216
How can you judge a man
that you don’t know?

699
00:55:23,217 --> 00:55:25,200
He’s a Bolshevik.

700
00:55:26,546 --> 00:55:29,197
A house, a possession...
You don’t destroy that.

701
00:55:29,198 --> 00:55:34,331
You must respect memory,
property. The work of others.

702
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:36,551
He... He does... he does...

703
00:55:36,552 --> 00:55:38,126
He sets a bad example,
that’s what he does.

704
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:39,115
Because you think that you
set a good one?

705
00:55:39,116 --> 00:55:42,049
I don’t set anything.
I want to be left alone.

706
00:55:46,098 --> 00:55:49,435
What now? What do you
hold against me?

707
00:55:49,436 --> 00:55:52,396
I hold against you
your lack of suffering.

708
00:55:52,397 --> 00:55:55,147
What do you know about that?

709
00:55:55,148 --> 00:55:59,964
Every man suffers inside,
and the way he can.

710
00:55:59,965 --> 00:56:04,267
You’re quite happy to own a car,
aren’t you? English suits.

711
00:56:05,354 --> 00:56:08,403
I had to work in spite of my moods
in order to feed my family,

712
00:56:08,404 --> 00:56:11,690
so I forbid you to judge me.

713
00:56:11,691 --> 00:56:13,876
Because all I did was because of you.

714
00:56:13,877 --> 00:56:18,669
So you would be comfortable,
and warm in winter.

715
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:23,237
So if your road-mender comes back
here, I’ll turn the dogs loose on him.

716
00:56:23,238 --> 00:56:26,205
You could show a little respect.
He’s miserable.

717
00:56:27,457 --> 00:56:31,645
God didn’t make miserable people.
Some are of their own doing.

718
00:56:31,646 --> 00:56:34,808
- Can you hear?
- Yes, I can hear

719
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:38,599
the voice of stupidity. The only one
that can still reach you.

720
00:56:41,203 --> 00:56:44,382
Are you happy? You hurt her.

721
00:56:44,383 --> 00:56:47,152
The meal will be overcooked again.

722
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:50,064
I’m sincerely sorry that I offended
the Lady of the castle.

723
00:56:50,065 --> 00:56:52,974
- Don’t call her that, Patrice.
- Hurry-up and join her.

724
00:56:52,975 --> 00:56:55,287
You may have a chance
to save our meal.

725
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:59,534
She loves me.

726
00:56:59,535 --> 00:57:02,342
If I wanted her to, she would
throw herself in fire for me.

727
00:57:02,343 --> 00:57:04,415
She’d rather throw
everybody else in.

728
00:57:22,531 --> 00:57:28,847
<i>Pujol. Dupin. Dormeur.</i>

729
00:57:28,848 --> 00:57:31,752
<i>The three I.O.U.s are not in
the same order anymore.</i>

730
00:57:31,753 --> 00:57:34,535
<i>The order in which
I decided to off them.</i>

731
00:57:34,536 --> 00:57:38,686
<i>Someone came. Someone
read these papers.</i>

732
00:57:39,742 --> 00:57:43,220
<i>Someone who’s not interested
in the gold coins either.</i>

733
00:57:47,545 --> 00:57:49,725
<i>Pujol, Dupin, Dormeur.</i>

734
00:57:49,726 --> 00:57:52,326
<i>In order to kill them,
first I must know them.</i>

735
00:57:52,327 --> 00:57:55,355
<i>Learn their ways.
Choose the time.</i>

736
00:57:59,439 --> 00:58:04,089
Séraphin!
What are you doing here?

737
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:06,563
Well, I.. I was looking for you.
Patrice wanted me to tell you something.

738
00:58:06,564 --> 00:58:09,092
- What?
- Well, he didn’t really know.

739
00:58:09,093 --> 00:58:10,397
He just wanted me to talk to you.

740
00:58:10,398 --> 00:58:13,036
- You know he’s a very good chap?
- Yes.

741
00:58:14,334 --> 00:58:15,902
He’s serious...

742
00:58:15,903 --> 00:58:18,679
Well... His face is broken, all right,
but inside, he’s like this.

743
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:19,954
I know.

744
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:23,530
And... he’s got some ideas,
well, he likes you.

745
00:58:23,531 --> 00:58:25,894
Would you like me to give him
a message, or...?

746
00:58:25,895 --> 00:58:29,717
- What should I tell him?
- The same thing.

747
00:58:29,718 --> 00:58:34,789
Oh? Well, OK.
Well... have a nice day.

748
00:58:58,374 --> 00:59:02,784
There, easy... There... Easy...

749
00:59:03,312 --> 00:59:06,896
Come on.

750
00:59:17,217 --> 00:59:20,719
What is it, dogs?
Is there someone here?

751
00:59:21,857 --> 00:59:25,598
No, there’s nothing.
Come on.

752
00:59:29,693 --> 00:59:31,593
Will he come everyday
to buy his bread?

753
00:59:31,594 --> 00:59:34,325
- Maybe he comes for Marie.
- Maybe he doesn’t come for Marie.

754
00:59:34,326 --> 00:59:35,891
And, at this time,
Marie is sleeping.

755
00:59:37,287 --> 00:59:39,413
Good morning, Séraphin.
You’re an early riser.

756
00:59:40,847 --> 00:59:43,646
What weather, isn’t it?
Have you seen the wind?

757
00:59:43,647 --> 00:59:45,161
- Is it the Mistral?
- No, it’s Lou Péou,

758
00:59:45,162 --> 00:59:48,161
the wind from the mountains.
It’s here for at least two days.

759
00:59:48,162 --> 00:59:50,648
The air is so dry that
the bread won’t rise.

760
00:59:50,649 --> 00:59:54,536
It’s frightening the birds, animals
are hiding and don’t eat anymore.

761
00:59:54,537 --> 00:59:57,453
- Even dogs.
- Dogs?

762
00:59:57,454 --> 01:00:00,666
Yes. They’re like wet blankets. They
don’t even have a sense of smell left.

763
01:00:00,667 --> 01:00:05,834
- So, what will you have? A fougasse?
- No. A choux bun.

764
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:10,278
<i>I’ve made my decision.</i>

765
01:00:11,686 --> 01:00:14,920
<i>Tonight, I’ll kill Gaspard Dupin.</i>

766
01:00:34,606 --> 01:00:37,897
Why didn’t you dare come in?
I’ve been looking for you everywhere.

767
01:00:37,898 --> 01:00:39,051
What do you mean, you’re
looking for me everywhere?

768
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,531
Yes, in the whole park.

769
01:00:40,532 --> 01:00:43,733
I saw you passing by earlier.
I called you.

770
01:00:43,734 --> 01:00:46,803
It wasn’t me. It was probably
your father or... or your brother.

771
01:00:46,804 --> 01:00:49,884
My brother is not home and
my father is playing billiards.

772
01:00:49,885 --> 01:00:52,940
But who cares since you
came to see me?

773
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:55,827
To see you?

774
01:01:07,601 --> 01:01:09,721
Would you rather have me
take my clothes off,

775
01:01:09,722 --> 01:01:12,125
or do it yourself?

776
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:16,076
- Shall I go there?
- Well... There.

777
01:01:20,419 --> 01:01:22,975
You’re not going to take
advantage of it and run, are you?

778
01:01:22,976 --> 01:01:24,966
No, why? No.

779
01:01:38,626 --> 01:01:42,044
You must look this way.
Look at me.

780
01:01:58,577 --> 01:02:00,666
Look at what I’m doing
when you’re not here.

781
01:02:03,623 --> 01:02:07,079
I close my eyes,

782
01:02:07,743 --> 01:02:09,942
and I imagine you.

783
01:02:15,281 --> 01:02:18,184
And I touch myself,
waiting for you.

784
01:02:18,185 --> 01:02:21,459
I can see you.

785
01:02:22,873 --> 01:02:25,388
You’re in front of the house.
You can’t find the key.

786
01:02:25,389 --> 01:02:27,855
You’re trying dozens of them.

787
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:32,142
You have a whole bunch.

788
01:02:33,869 --> 01:02:35,566
But never the right one.

789
01:02:37,367 --> 01:02:39,118
Say it, that it’s never
the right one.

790
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,894
No, it’s never the right one.

791
01:02:41,895 --> 01:02:44,864
Your brow is burning.

792
01:02:46,255 --> 01:02:48,728
Your fingers are trembling.

793
01:02:48,729 --> 01:02:52,713
And the wind...
the wind is arousing you.

794
01:02:52,714 --> 01:02:54,909
It’s Lou Péou, the wind
from the mountains.

795
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:58,933
Come. Come, I beseech you.

796
01:03:05,622 --> 01:03:09,067
No. Not yet. You’re not here.

797
01:03:09,068 --> 01:03:11,858
You’re at the door, downstairs.
You’re trying the keys.

798
01:03:11,859 --> 01:03:15,509
- Should I go downstairs?
- Oh, no, Séraphin. Come.

799
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:17,741
I’ve been waiting so long for you.

800
01:03:17,742 --> 01:03:23,556
Do you like me? Tell me you
like me. Tell me I’m alive.

801
01:03:23,557 --> 01:03:27,157
Kiss me. Kiss me!

802
01:03:27,158 --> 01:03:29,577
No, you’re not here,
you’re downstairs.

803
01:03:29,578 --> 01:03:32,895
I got impatient:
I broke the door open.

804
01:03:41,798 --> 01:03:44,340
At last, you make up your mind.

805
01:03:46,783 --> 01:03:52,258
Easy, now. Easy.

806
01:04:14,523 --> 01:04:17,798
Yes. You’re making love to me on
the plaza, in front of everybody.

807
01:04:17,799 --> 01:04:20,973
They're all here, all those who
wanted to bury us.

808
01:04:20,974 --> 01:04:24,204
But we’re stronger.

809
01:04:24,205 --> 01:04:27,260
They’re watching us.
It’s killing them.

810
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:29,660
Patrice!

811
01:04:30,092 --> 01:04:33,335
Patrice... Oh, my God.

812
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:36,213
It can’t be. He killed himself.

813
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:47,708
- Oh, my God!
- Patrice! Patrice!

814
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:55,020
Oh, thank you, God.

815
01:04:55,021 --> 01:04:59,594
Thank you, God.
Thank you, God.

816
01:05:06,381 --> 01:05:09,200
It’s his fault. If only you
didn’t bring him here,

817
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:12,879
nothing would have happened.
He carries death.

818
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:17,590
- He killed your father.
- Shut up, you poor madwoman.

819
01:05:18,909 --> 01:05:21,854
At least shut up.

820
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:36,149
- What happened?
- He slipped, I guess.

821
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:40,199
I killed the dogs but it
was too late.

822
01:05:40,666 --> 01:05:42,958
Then the other one
came out with her rifle.

823
01:05:42,959 --> 01:05:46,110
She thought she saw a figure
in the park.

824
01:05:46,111 --> 01:05:49,487
- You, probably.
- I don’t know. Maybe.

825
01:05:49,488 --> 01:05:52,624
I was just coming back from
a date with the Persian.

826
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:57,703
Rose.

827
01:05:57,704 --> 01:06:01,552
Thanks to you.

828
01:06:01,553 --> 01:06:04,278
I was happy.

829
01:06:07,386 --> 01:06:11,175
I regret to see him dead
but I just can’t be unhappy.

830
01:06:21,414 --> 01:06:23,523
- Where are you going?
- Home.

831
01:06:23,524 --> 01:06:25,346
You must stay. I need you.

832
01:06:25,347 --> 01:06:27,970
The doctor and the gendarmes
will be here soon.

833
01:06:27,971 --> 01:06:30,423
It’s an accident but they’ll
have questions to ask.

834
01:06:30,424 --> 01:06:34,261
You were on the scene. Don’t worry:
I’ll say why you were here.

835
01:06:34,262 --> 01:06:37,078
I’m not afraid.
Not for me anyway.

836
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:40,048
But I’ll be delighted to tell them
we were making love.

837
01:07:08,895 --> 01:07:13,930
Hey. Gaspard Dupin won’t
be buried whole.

838
01:07:13,931 --> 01:07:16,855
What are you saying?

839
01:07:16,856 --> 01:07:19,115
He’ll be cut open like
a butchered animal.

840
01:07:19,116 --> 01:07:20,321
What’s that horrible story?

841
01:07:20,322 --> 01:07:24,588
Dr Romand was finishing his report,
writing "natural causes",

842
01:07:24,589 --> 01:07:29,585
and suddenly a gendarme arrived,
all drenched and his teeth chattering.

843
01:07:29,586 --> 01:07:30,847
- It didn’t rain, did it?
- No,

844
01:07:30,848 --> 01:07:32,919
but he fell in the pond at the
same spot as Dupin.

845
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,481
So the captain went to see why.
And, when he came back, he said:

846
01:07:35,482 --> 01:07:37,674
the brink has been made
slippery for three yards,

847
01:07:37,675 --> 01:07:40,002
anybody who’d walk on it
was sure to fall in the water.

848
01:07:40,003 --> 01:07:44,155
- So what?
- The brink had been soaped.

849
01:07:45,015 --> 01:07:47,481
- A regular ice rink.
- What does it mean?

850
01:07:48,674 --> 01:07:51,531
- It means it’s a crime.
- A crime. And who?

851
01:07:51,532 --> 01:07:55,076
What do you mean, who? It’s him!
The man who’s demolishing his house.

852
01:07:55,077 --> 01:07:56,623
He’s got blood in his head.

853
01:07:56,624 --> 01:07:59,880
is whole family was murdered: do you
think it’s normal that he escaped alive?

854
01:07:59,881 --> 01:08:02,897
- He was three weeks old.
- He drags death behind him.

855
01:08:02,898 --> 01:08:04,261
He brings it with him
everywhere he goes.

856
01:08:04,262 --> 01:08:06,275
- Just consider the war.
- Shut up, you’re crazy.

857
01:08:06,276 --> 01:08:09,732
Anyway, somebody
put soap on the brink.

858
01:08:14,433 --> 01:08:16,260
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

859
01:08:18,062 --> 01:08:20,019
Do you want to tell me something?

860
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:22,643
You must have had a good alibi
since they released you.

861
01:08:25,736 --> 01:08:29,106
- I never believed it was you,
you know. - Thank you.

862
01:08:29,141 --> 01:08:32,617
They arrested the Dupin boy.
A matter of inheritance, they say.

863
01:08:32,618 --> 01:08:34,938
They always think people
do things for money.

864
01:08:34,939 --> 01:08:37,201
I don’t care.

865
01:08:38,329 --> 01:08:40,490
Is it true what they say
about you and that widow?

866
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:41,850
I’m not interested in
what they say.

867
01:08:42,715 --> 01:08:46,417
I can’t sleep anymore. I forget
the bread, I fumble my deliveries.

868
01:08:49,119 --> 01:08:52,680
Marie. I can’t see clearly.

869
01:08:52,681 --> 01:08:55,961
Come on: to break one’s house, to mend
the road, there are other things in life.

870
01:08:55,962 --> 01:08:59,566
Yes, there are. But I’m
not able to love.

871
01:09:00,426 --> 01:09:04,891
- Even the widow?
- Even the widow.

872
01:09:04,926 --> 01:09:07,157
In that case, I’ll wait.

873
01:09:07,158 --> 01:09:11,174
- Patrice Dupin is the killer.
- It is not true. You’re making it up.

874
01:09:11,175 --> 01:09:13,496
- He might be.
- No. I know he isn’t.

875
01:09:13,497 --> 01:09:14,995
It can’t be anybody else,
do you hear me?

876
01:09:14,996 --> 01:09:17,395
- Who else could it be?
- Nobody asked you anything.

877
01:09:18,775 --> 01:09:20,585
- I’m going there anyway.
- Where?

878
01:09:20,586 --> 01:09:23,821
To court. He mustn’t believe that
everybody is letting him down.

879
01:09:23,822 --> 01:09:25,549
Either you stay here
or I'll lock you up in your room.

880
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:28,564
Don’t say anything to her.
He’s the Dupin boy, regardless...

881
01:09:28,565 --> 01:09:30,127
I would go even if he weren’t
a rich man.

882
01:09:30,128 --> 01:09:32,774
- As long as it’s a man, she goes,
anyway. - Do you want a slap?

883
01:09:32,775 --> 01:09:35,886
Two months ago, you talked only about
Séraphin Monge. Say it isn’t so.

884
01:09:35,887 --> 01:09:41,137
It is so. But I can’t do anything
about Séraphin. He’s not a man.

885
01:09:44,684 --> 01:09:47,797
Did you hear what the kid said?
He’s not a man.

886
01:09:47,798 --> 01:09:51,053
- And no man killed Dupin.
- What are you making up now?

887
01:09:51,054 --> 01:09:55,271
A rifle, a knife, anything like that we can
understand. Those are a man’s weapons.

888
01:09:55,272 --> 01:09:57,480
- But soap...
- So what?

889
01:09:57,481 --> 01:10:01,214
What if the kid was right?
What if Patrice Dupin was innocent?

890
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,478
Somebody killed Gaspard.

891
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:08,575
A woman’s fancy ideas.
Why would Monge do it? No reason.

892
01:10:08,576 --> 01:10:12,743
I’m not like others who fear him.
He wouldn’t hurt anybody.

893
01:10:12,744 --> 01:10:15,974
He’s just a jinx.
He didn’t do a thing.

894
01:10:15,975 --> 01:10:19,562
These are morphotheseus
from South America.

895
01:10:19,597 --> 01:10:23,115
These species are worth
thousands of francs.

896
01:10:23,116 --> 01:10:26,302
I’m very interested in butterflies.
Before the war, it was old coins but...

897
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:28,942
on a wall, these are
more beautiful.

898
01:10:29,927 --> 01:10:33,805
- Why were those things in your car?
- The butterflies are not mine.

899
01:10:33,806 --> 01:10:36,437
I’m talking about the wax
and black soap.

900
01:10:36,438 --> 01:10:40,539
Who says mechanics says failure,
and who says failure says repairs.

901
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:43,276
I’ve got a passion for it.
I like to repair.

902
01:10:43,277 --> 01:10:45,164
And I like to wash
my hands afterwards.

903
01:10:45,165 --> 01:10:47,455
And the wax?

904
01:10:47,456 --> 01:10:50,086
- For the brass parts.
- Of course.

905
01:10:50,087 --> 01:10:53,122
As for the revolver...

906
01:10:54,023 --> 01:10:56,657
I don’t think my father was
murdered with a firearm.

907
01:10:56,658 --> 01:10:59,781
Indeed... but the problem is...

908
01:10:59,782 --> 01:11:03,008
there’s a two hours gap
in your schedule.

909
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:05,170
- True.
- Where were you?

910
01:11:06,735 --> 01:11:08,465
I do not wish to answer
that question.

911
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:12,127
Between 8 and 10 pm,
you had ample time

912
01:11:12,128 --> 01:11:13,571
to put soap on the brink
of the pond,

913
01:11:13,614 --> 01:11:15,437
so I want to know
where you were.

914
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:18,053
What about you? Where
were you during the war?

915
01:11:18,054 --> 01:11:21,525
- I did my duty.
- Behind the lines.

916
01:11:21,526 --> 01:11:24,085
Arresting the poor chaps
who didn’t join their unit.

917
01:11:24,086 --> 01:11:26,877
- You refuse to answer?
- Yes.

918
01:11:26,878 --> 01:11:30,331
In that case, I’m forced
to keep you here.

919
01:11:33,045 --> 01:11:36,854
Let’s be clear: I’m not charging you
directly with the murder of your father. No,

920
01:11:36,855 --> 01:11:41,741
but I’m charging you with illegal
carrying of a weapon.

921
01:11:41,742 --> 01:11:43,975
Mementos from the war
are all very fine,

922
01:11:43,976 --> 01:11:46,522
but you don’t have a right
to take them out of your home.

923
01:11:46,523 --> 01:11:50,216
It’s not a memento from the war.
I’ve got other ones.

924
01:11:50,217 --> 01:11:53,399
- Oh, look, I...
- No.

925
01:11:54,661 --> 01:11:57,471
I had a pal with a face
such as mine,

926
01:11:57,472 --> 01:12:00,103
maybe a little more stitched,

927
01:12:00,104 --> 01:12:03,320
and one day, since he fought
a lost battle...

928
01:12:05,116 --> 01:12:10,082
I can say that again, can’t I?
He blew it off.

929
01:12:11,341 --> 01:12:13,805
With this.

930
01:12:13,806 --> 01:12:18,606
Then he bequeathed it to me
in his will,

931
01:12:18,607 --> 01:12:20,545
as an ironic joke.

932
01:12:20,546 --> 01:12:23,729
- The law.
- The law is the law.

933
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:26,124
That’s a comfort.

934
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:28,840
I of course allow you
to hire a lawyer.

935
01:12:28,841 --> 01:12:30,960
We’ll examine within 48 hours
your provisional release but,

936
01:12:30,961 --> 01:12:35,751
until then, I’m really sorry...

937
01:13:02,489 --> 01:13:06,268
Séraphin Monge! The village
is going to try to get you.

938
01:13:06,269 --> 01:13:09,263
You must leave. For ever.

939
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:16,663
Crime poisons everything.
Assassins and victims.

940
01:13:16,664 --> 01:13:20,398
And it’s catching.
Worse than the plague.

941
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:24,470
Zorme. Old Brigue said
you had powers.

942
01:13:24,471 --> 01:13:27,351
Everybody here fears you.
But not me.

943
01:13:27,352 --> 01:13:30,274
So if you’ve got something to say,
say it now or shut up.

944
01:13:30,275 --> 01:13:32,470
Don’t challenge Zorme,
Séraphin, ever!

945
01:13:32,471 --> 01:13:34,423
If you don’t want fate
to catch up with you.

946
01:13:35,762 --> 01:13:39,273
It’s here, your fate.
I hold it.

947
01:13:39,274 --> 01:13:43,305
I hold it back.
But if you challenge me...

948
01:13:46,365 --> 01:13:48,180
Go to bed, go, you’ve
drunk too much, go.

949
01:13:48,181 --> 01:13:51,064
Yes, I have drunk.
Yes, I drink,

950
01:13:51,065 --> 01:13:53,624
because I’ve got the power...
but I can’t change a thing.

951
01:13:53,625 --> 01:13:56,191
Flee... Forget it all.

952
01:13:56,192 --> 01:13:59,958
Now that you murdered your house,
you’ve got nothing more to do here.

953
01:13:59,959 --> 01:14:03,270
You don’t have any roots.
You’ll always be a stranger,

954
01:14:03,271 --> 01:14:04,747
because they’ll always be cowards.

955
01:14:04,748 --> 01:14:08,836
They’ll always reject you.
They’ll choke you like remorse.

956
01:14:08,837 --> 01:14:11,324
They’ll take revenge.

957
01:14:11,325 --> 01:14:14,812
If you marry a woman here,
you’ll bring her misery

958
01:14:14,813 --> 01:14:17,332
and your children will bear
the mark of blood.

959
01:14:17,333 --> 01:14:19,884
Scram. You’re the one
who must go.

960
01:14:19,885 --> 01:14:22,831
This is my home. Even if
there’s nothing left.

961
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:31,159
Séraphin. On the night
they died...

962
01:14:33,738 --> 01:14:37,058
You must flee!
I say flee all this!

963
01:14:37,059 --> 01:14:40,121
Them! And especially
yourself...

964
01:14:40,122 --> 01:14:46,713
especially yourself. If you don’t...
Fate, Séraphin, fate...

965
01:14:54,893 --> 01:14:57,680
- What are you doing. - Can’t you
see I’m going to knead the dough.

966
01:14:57,681 --> 01:15:00,072
You’re kneading with a rifle, now?

967
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:06,368
Gustave Dupin, in spite of all
the precautions he took,

968
01:15:06,369 --> 01:15:08,327
managed to slip on black soap.

969
01:15:08,328 --> 01:15:11,726
People almost believed it was natural
death, so I, from now on, take the rifle.

970
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:14,465
- He’s afraid.
- Who?

971
01:15:14,466 --> 01:15:16,705
- Célestat?
- Yes.

972
01:15:16,706 --> 01:15:19,061
Every night, he goes kneading
with his rifle.

973
01:15:19,969 --> 01:15:21,446
He’s afraid of being alone
in the night.

974
01:15:21,447 --> 01:15:24,090
Rich Dupin's daughter:
the death of her father

975
01:15:24,242 --> 01:15:26,500
doesn't prevent her
from chasing men.

976
01:15:26,535 --> 01:15:29,947
They say she makes merry
with Séraphin.

977
01:15:30,516 --> 01:15:33,387
The widow and the orphan.
They do make a nice pair.

978
01:15:33,388 --> 01:15:36,059
Hand in hand, their feet in blood
and the prospective inheritance...

979
01:15:36,725 --> 01:15:38,070
It’s not true.
You’re talking nonsense.

980
01:15:38,071 --> 01:15:41,202
- Marie, where are you going?
- Ask her: she knows everything.

981
01:15:41,447 --> 01:15:45,005
- Marie!
- What’s with her?

982
01:15:45,006 --> 01:15:48,181
I don’t want to hurt the kid.
I’m almost her grandmother.

983
01:15:49,819 --> 01:15:52,269
Séraphin had better not
take her from me, or else...

984
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:54,711
- The poor boy is only asking for peace.
- Is he?

985
01:15:54,712 --> 01:15:59,279
Some accuse him of the crime.
They would be ready to hunt him.

986
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,198
So he’d better not hurt Marie.

987
01:16:35,776 --> 01:16:37,624
I won’t tell on you.

988
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:42,135
I didn’t love my father.
I now know what he did to you.

989
01:16:42,972 --> 01:16:47,177
- Was he the murderer of La Burlière?
- There were three of them.

990
01:16:49,157 --> 01:16:52,792
So that was your secret.

991
01:17:01,414 --> 01:17:04,446
- Do you enjoy punishing?
- But I didn’t.

992
01:17:04,447 --> 01:17:07,238
The idea crossed me, true,
but I didn’t tell anyone.

993
01:17:07,239 --> 01:17:08,705
It’s as if someone read
my thoughts.

994
01:17:08,706 --> 01:17:12,729
That did us a great favour. He was
about to ruin us with his Conchita.

995
01:17:40,424 --> 01:17:43,931
Put your clothes back on.

996
01:17:43,932 --> 01:17:47,322
Go away.

997
01:17:51,174 --> 01:17:53,937
It doesn’t matter.

998
01:18:08,905 --> 01:18:11,478
Now there’s something even
stronger between us.

999
01:18:12,047 --> 01:18:15,462
I didn’t throw myself at you
because I needed a man, Séraphin,

1000
01:18:15,463 --> 01:18:18,728
but because they took everything
from you. They ruined our lives.

1001
01:18:18,792 --> 01:18:23,032
- But we’re alike and we’ll make
them pay. - No, we’re not alike.

1002
01:18:23,033 --> 01:18:25,471
They got your husband, they got
your brother, but it was the war.

1003
01:18:25,472 --> 01:18:28,923
- It was nobody’s fault. - It was. It’s
always the same people who make it.

1004
01:18:28,924 --> 01:18:31,929
The bastards, the cowards, with
their secrets and their righteousness,

1005
01:18:31,930 --> 01:18:34,747
who build memorials to the dead to
prove to themselves that they’re alive.

1006
01:18:34,748 --> 01:18:37,564
The only thing that can
unite us is revenge.

1007
01:18:37,565 --> 01:18:41,724
Which one do you want now?
Pujol? Dormeur?

1008
01:18:41,725 --> 01:18:45,308
And now, for everybody,
it will be an accident.

1009
01:18:57,578 --> 01:19:00,182
Charmaine!

1010
01:19:00,726 --> 01:19:03,320
Charmaine!

1011
01:20:34,376 --> 01:20:37,401
Séraphin!

1012
01:20:43,897 --> 01:20:45,519
No.

1013
01:20:46,586 --> 01:20:48,708
- Did you love her?
- No.

1014
01:20:48,709 --> 01:20:51,218
My God, don’t say that. At least,
let her have had something.

1015
01:20:51,219 --> 01:20:53,891
- Of course you loved her.
- No.

1016
01:20:53,892 --> 01:20:58,059
Why was she in your home then?
And why are you here?

1017
01:20:59,452 --> 01:21:02,397
Zorme is right:
I bring death. Go away.

1018
01:21:03,487 --> 01:21:05,589
Go away!

1019
01:21:06,766 --> 01:21:08,199
Séraphin Monge killed my master

1020
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,719
because he wanted to marry
his daughter for the inheritance

1021
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,598
and my master was
squandering his fortune.

1022
01:21:12,599 --> 01:21:15,367
And right he was not to want
to leave anything to those ravens.

1023
01:21:17,088 --> 01:21:21,347
But Charmaine fought back
when her brother was accused.

1024
01:21:21,348 --> 01:21:24,785
She told Monge that she would
confess everything to you.

1025
01:21:24,786 --> 01:21:26,979
So Monge used the dogs
to kill her.

1026
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:29,094
Why didn't the dogs do
anything to him?

1027
01:21:29,095 --> 01:21:30,455
Because they can feel
he’s the Devil.

1028
01:21:30,456 --> 01:21:34,327
Miss de Pontratieu. What are
the grounds for your accusation?

1029
01:21:35,881 --> 01:21:39,702
The castle belonged to my family.
I grew up with Mr. Dupin.

1030
01:21:39,703 --> 01:21:43,015
He was our game-keeper’s son.

1031
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,367
When he bought the castle
from me, after the war,

1032
01:21:47,368 --> 01:21:50,231
he kept me near him as
his housekeeper.

1033
01:21:52,276 --> 01:21:57,183
He... I think he always felt
something for me.

1034
01:21:59,002 --> 01:22:02,274
So, since they didn’t let me
kill the damn Devil,

1035
01:22:02,275 --> 01:22:04,666
let him be locked up!
Or it will go on!

1036
01:22:05,612 --> 01:22:08,873
Marie Dormeur? Come.

1037
01:22:14,519 --> 01:22:17,755
I’m going to file a complaint.
That girl broke my rifle.

1038
01:22:17,756 --> 01:22:19,287
Marie Dormeur...

1039
01:22:19,288 --> 01:22:22,330
Have you seen Séraphin Monge
open the gate of the kennel?

1040
01:22:22,331 --> 01:22:25,417
What? Are you mad?
Did she tell you that?

1041
01:22:26,472 --> 01:22:28,643
She’s a nasty piece of work
and she can’t see a thing.

1042
01:22:28,644 --> 01:22:30,302
But, you know, I saw a man,

1043
01:22:30,303 --> 01:22:32,759
another one, who went out of the
park on a bicycle with no lights.

1044
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,386
And you failed to identify him?

1045
01:22:34,387 --> 01:22:39,104
Yes... I couldn’t look at him, I had
just heard the... the noise of the...

1046
01:22:39,105 --> 01:22:41,810
Are you quite sure?

1047
01:22:41,811 --> 01:22:44,065
Do you know the penalty
for bearing false witness?

1048
01:22:44,066 --> 01:22:46,935
Why do you want to clear
Séraphin Monge at all cost?

1049
01:22:46,936 --> 01:22:49,144
Because he didn’t do it.

1050
01:22:49,145 --> 01:22:50,611
They were in his home,
Charmaine and he.

1051
01:22:50,612 --> 01:22:52,578
Then she took her car, then he
followed her on his bike,

1052
01:22:52,579 --> 01:22:54,232
and I followed in turn.

1053
01:22:54,233 --> 01:22:55,859
He couldn’t possibly arrive there
before her and let the dogs loose.

1054
01:22:55,860 --> 01:22:57,947
And what were they doing
together in Monge’s place.

1055
01:23:01,346 --> 01:23:04,675
She came to make love to him.

1056
01:23:04,676 --> 01:23:09,243
What about Monge? Why did
you follow him to the castle?

1057
01:23:14,651 --> 01:23:16,746
Because I love him.

1058
01:23:53,789 --> 01:23:55,927
Wait. Let me.

1059
01:24:00,774 --> 01:24:04,134
Thank you for what you did.
What you told the judge.

1060
01:24:04,135 --> 01:24:06,982
- It was the truth.
- It’s not easy to say.

1061
01:24:06,983 --> 01:24:10,272
Are you very very sad?

1062
01:24:10,273 --> 01:24:13,430
She was much more
than my sister.

1063
01:24:16,279 --> 01:24:19,637
- You can’t understand.
- I can.

1064
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:21,422
Because, now,
there are two of us.

1065
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:25,727
Look at Séraphin:
he’s alone, truly alone,

1066
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:28,431
because he hasn’t got
anything to give.

1067
01:24:28,432 --> 01:24:32,078
But I need you.

1068
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:35,342
- I love you.
- I’ll never leave you.

1069
01:24:41,328 --> 01:24:42,786
Séraphin, you’re not going
to believe this,

1070
01:24:42,787 --> 01:24:46,240
but I’m sure I left my ring on
the stone, here, and it disappeared.

1071
01:24:57,404 --> 01:25:02,575
- Did you find something?
- No, but someone was here.

1072
01:25:02,576 --> 01:25:05,095
Do you think they’ve
taken my ring?

1073
01:25:05,096 --> 01:25:07,942
It was a present, but it’s
not worth much.

1074
01:25:07,943 --> 01:25:12,702
No. That presence... I know it.

1075
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:17,839
He’s always with me...
watching me... following me...

1076
01:25:19,005 --> 01:25:23,187
- Why the ring, then?
- Why Charmaine?

1077
01:25:26,802 --> 01:25:30,583
Marie! Marie!
What has she got? My God...

1078
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:32,729
- I don’t know. She...
- She’s got a fever. I’ll help her inside.

1079
01:25:32,730 --> 01:25:36,408
- Wait. I’ll help you.
- No, no. Her father, you know...

1080
01:25:36,409 --> 01:25:39,592
He doesn’t like me, I know.

1081
01:27:15,667 --> 01:27:18,856
- What does the doctor say?
- He says it’s got to run its course.

1082
01:27:18,857 --> 01:27:20,923
He says he doesn’t know
what it is.

1083
01:27:20,924 --> 01:27:24,799
- I know.
- You don’t know a thing

1084
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:28,251
- Did she eat?
- Almost nothing.

1085
01:27:28,252 --> 01:27:31,955
- Sometimes, she speaks.
- What does she say?

1086
01:27:31,956 --> 01:27:35,570
- Nonsense. What would you
want her to say? - What nonsense?

1087
01:27:35,571 --> 01:27:38,031
That she saw someone
at the castle.

1088
01:27:38,032 --> 01:27:41,632
That she saw him again in a dream
and knew whom it was, or something.

1089
01:27:45,121 --> 01:27:47,887
What must we do in order
to expel the illness?

1090
01:27:51,042 --> 01:27:53,884
Try to make her drink some
St-John’s wort in goat milk.

1091
01:27:53,885 --> 01:27:55,736
I had her drink it all already.

1092
01:27:55,737 --> 01:27:59,504
Hyssopus and hyoscyamus,
comfrey and smilax aspera,

1093
01:27:59,505 --> 01:28:04,175
bermudagrass and sea queen
and everything you told me.

1094
01:28:04,176 --> 01:28:08,847
You must trust in God
when herbs are useless.

1095
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:13,135
Marie! Who did you see at the castle,
Marie, my little girl? Answer!

1096
01:30:08,819 --> 01:30:11,437
So it was really you?

1097
01:30:11,438 --> 01:30:13,688
I was trying not to believe it,
to tell myself... but,

1098
01:30:13,689 --> 01:30:15,920
come to think of it,
I knew you’d come.

1099
01:30:15,921 --> 01:30:18,639
I’ve been waiting for so long.

1100
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,512
- You killed Dupin, didn’t you?
- No.

1101
01:30:21,513 --> 01:30:23,819
Although I swore to kill him,
just like you.

1102
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:26,675
But I’m going to kill you.
Do you know why?

1103
01:30:26,676 --> 01:30:30,355
Put the rifle away, Séraphin.
I can explain.

1104
01:30:30,356 --> 01:30:31,354
We can reach an agreement:
I’ve got money.

1105
01:30:31,355 --> 01:30:33,457
I know. I found the IOU.

1106
01:30:33,458 --> 01:30:36,724
So what? It just means that
I owed some money to your father.

1107
01:30:36,725 --> 01:30:40,156
- I can give it back to you.
- No, you can’t give me anything back.

1108
01:30:40,157 --> 01:30:44,180
For one thing, your father was as much
a thief as we were. And even more.

1109
01:30:44,181 --> 01:30:46,610
Ask anybody in the village:
they all know he was.

1110
01:30:46,611 --> 01:30:49,323
And he really asked for what
happened to him.

1111
01:30:51,001 --> 01:30:54,510
But we didn’t do it.
I swear we didn’t.

1112
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,075
When we came in La Burlière,
nothing happened as we wanted.

1113
01:31:00,129 --> 01:31:01,723
I never could forget that night...

1114
01:32:14,417 --> 01:32:19,307
Go on! Throw it!
Can’t you do it?

1115
01:32:20,971 --> 01:32:22,300
Why don’t you guys help him?

1116
01:32:22,301 --> 01:32:25,511
You can’t be cowards, since
there are many of you.

1117
01:32:25,810 --> 01:32:29,069
I’m a murderer. You must
prevent me from going on.

1118
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:33,645
Except... except if it
suits someone:

1119
01:32:33,646 --> 01:32:37,174
Dupin’s death, Pujol’s death...

1120
01:32:37,175 --> 01:32:39,072
You charge me with the accounts
you settle among you

1121
01:32:39,073 --> 01:32:40,966
and I end up on the Guillotine?

1122
01:32:40,967 --> 01:32:43,216
Like the foreigners did.

1123
01:32:43,217 --> 01:32:45,025
I’m the ideal culprit.

1124
01:32:45,026 --> 01:32:46,843
I really wanted to avenge
my family.

1125
01:32:46,844 --> 01:32:49,200
But there’s someone here
killing for me.

1126
01:32:49,201 --> 01:32:54,918
So who is he?
You? Him?

1127
01:32:54,919 --> 01:33:02,974
Some cousin? Some neighbour?
A notary? Maybe a baker?

1128
01:33:04,209 --> 01:33:08,062
I don’t care about your quarrels.
I came here because this is my home.

1129
01:33:08,063 --> 01:33:10,591
My home, can you hear me?

1130
01:33:10,592 --> 01:33:13,119
My home... let’s talk about it.

1131
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:15,847
I have a house, I demolish it. I sleep
with a girl and someone kills her.

1132
01:33:15,848 --> 01:33:18,439
I’ve got a vengeance,
someone steals it from me.

1133
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:20,751
I’m alone. I always was alone.

1134
01:33:21,491 --> 01:33:24,711
They parked me for ten years with nuns,
for seven years with lumberjacks,

1135
01:33:24,712 --> 01:33:26,062
then they threw me in
the middle of a war,

1136
01:33:26,063 --> 01:33:29,392
I had no one for whom to survive,
but I’m not dead.

1137
01:33:29,393 --> 01:33:31,950
I’m not dead! I’m not dead!

1138
01:33:36,942 --> 01:33:38,655
I’m not dead.

1139
01:33:42,518 --> 01:33:43,754
Now, I’m going back to my place

1140
01:33:43,755 --> 01:33:48,193
and if you set it on fire,
you can sleep soundly:

1141
01:33:48,194 --> 01:33:50,657
I’ve got no child to come
and avenge me.

1142
01:34:44,332 --> 01:34:47,059
Go and see him.
Maybe he can cure her.

1143
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:48,238
What if he were the bastard?

1144
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:50,455
I didn’t dare to say it,
so afraid am I of him.

1145
01:34:50,456 --> 01:34:53,864
- But why? We never hurt him, did we?
- I don’t know, Célestat.

1146
01:34:53,865 --> 01:34:55,871
When you look at him,
I don’t know you anymore.

1147
01:34:55,872 --> 01:34:57,847
As if there were
something else between you.

1148
01:35:03,347 --> 01:35:08,359
- You must tell the truth, Célestat.
- Dupin, Pujol. I’m next.

1149
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:11,525
My daughter will stay alone with
her illness. Don’t leave her.

1150
01:35:11,526 --> 01:35:13,708
Célestat, I was like you,
like the others.

1151
01:35:13,709 --> 01:35:16,351
We let them make an assassin
in order to forget that we’re guilty.

1152
01:35:16,352 --> 01:35:19,224
But now we must save him from
the villagers. Do you understand?

1153
01:35:19,225 --> 01:35:22,354
Because only he can still
do something for Marie.

1154
01:35:22,355 --> 01:35:24,914
- Séraphin Monge?
- Yes.

1155
01:35:24,915 --> 01:35:27,959
Zorme is strong enough to make
people die without touching them,

1156
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:31,175
so maybe he also has powers.

1157
01:35:48,338 --> 01:35:52,285
Séraphin.

1158
01:35:57,332 --> 01:35:59,174
- Séraphin.
- What?

1159
01:35:59,175 --> 01:36:01,391
Don’t think about death anymore
or you’ll kill them all.

1160
01:36:01,392 --> 01:36:03,470
I keep repeating I didn’t do it.

1161
01:36:07,435 --> 01:36:09,774
The man who came to see you.
The journeyman.

1162
01:36:09,775 --> 01:36:12,911
When you’re house fell down on him,
he was about to tell you something...

1163
01:36:12,912 --> 01:36:15,790
Yes, he saw the three of them:
Dupin, Pujol and Dormeur.

1164
01:36:15,791 --> 01:36:19,191
Indeed he saw them. But near
the spring, not in La Burlière.

1165
01:36:19,192 --> 01:36:21,518
In La Burlière, he saw
something else.

1166
01:36:26,193 --> 01:36:29,551
When thirst woke him up,
he lifted up the trapdoor.

1167
01:36:29,552 --> 01:36:32,328
He saw two men fighting.
One was your father

1168
01:36:32,329 --> 01:36:34,186
He held something red
in his hand.

1169
01:36:34,187 --> 01:36:35,969
The other one held
a shining weapon.

1170
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:37,753
Then he lost his balance.

1171
01:36:37,754 --> 01:36:42,082
He grabbed the spit while he fell,
just when your father jumped him.

1172
01:36:42,083 --> 01:36:44,337
And your father skewered
himself on it.

1173
01:36:44,338 --> 01:36:46,641
But Monge didn’t fall at once:

1174
01:36:46,642 --> 01:36:49,916
he walked three more steps
with the spit inside his belly,

1175
01:36:51,402 --> 01:36:53,587
and he leaned on the wall.

1176
01:37:02,067 --> 01:37:04,919
So the other man approached,
yanked his head backwards

1177
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:07,774
and slit his throat.

1178
01:37:07,775 --> 01:37:11,704
- Just one man?
- Yes.

1179
01:37:11,705 --> 01:37:14,311
- Just one man and dead bodies.
- Who was he?

1180
01:37:16,281 --> 01:37:18,559
When everything was over
and he’d fled,

1181
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:21,970
the journeyman saw the
man again, near the well.

1182
01:37:21,971 --> 01:37:24,023
He saw him throw something
down in it.

1183
01:37:24,024 --> 01:37:28,504
He told me... He told me
that he heard him cry.

1184
01:37:29,649 --> 01:37:32,927
But why did he tell you all this?
Why you?

1185
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:36,847
It was the first time in 25 years
that he told it to anybody.

1186
01:37:37,891 --> 01:37:40,079
To you, he shouldn’t
have spoken.

1187
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:41,814
Your house didn’t kill him
without a reason.

1188
01:37:41,815 --> 01:37:43,335
What about the others?
The three men.

1189
01:37:43,336 --> 01:37:46,103
- Just one man, Séraphin.
- Why didn’t you say so before?

1190
01:37:49,202 --> 01:37:51,271
I didn’t want
to wake misery up.

1191
01:37:51,272 --> 01:37:53,983
Why now then?
It’s too late.

1192
01:37:53,984 --> 01:37:57,319
If you discover the real culprit,
misery will stop.

1193
01:37:57,320 --> 01:38:00,610
Séraphin you’re not cursed.
We are.

1194
01:38:00,611 --> 01:38:02,979
Because we knew everything, we
knew everything right from the start.

1195
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:05,135
We didn’t want to face
the truth.

1196
01:38:05,136 --> 01:38:08,800
We chose to live with the secret,
with fear, but live anyway.

1197
01:38:08,801 --> 01:38:10,868
We didn’t talk, so people
wouldn’t gossip,

1198
01:38:10,869 --> 01:38:14,764
wouldn’t look at us askance
in Peyrolles and the other villages,

1199
01:38:14,765 --> 01:38:17,659
well, to keep the same life,
the one we know.

1200
01:38:17,660 --> 01:38:20,691
The weight of days
is heavier than hate.

1201
01:38:20,692 --> 01:38:25,114
And now we must save Marie.
She wants to die because of us.

1202
01:38:25,115 --> 01:38:27,531
Go, Séraphin. Go and see
what’s in the well.

1203
01:39:16,212 --> 01:39:20,712
Zorme... Monge...

1204
01:39:20,713 --> 01:39:23,170
So you found it, at last.
Are you happy?

1205
01:39:23,171 --> 01:39:26,057
They told you in the end.
And now you think you know,

1206
01:39:26,058 --> 01:39:28,329
because the name Zorme
is written on a knife.

1207
01:39:28,330 --> 01:39:31,917
But why would I have killed your family?
I was the only one who had no reason to.

1208
01:39:31,918 --> 01:39:34,023
The murderers are the Monges.

1209
01:39:34,024 --> 01:39:37,102
From father to son, for many
generations, they’ve killed travelers.

1210
01:39:37,103 --> 01:39:40,183
Their treasure belonged to the
skeletons on which you’re now walking.

1211
01:39:40,184 --> 01:39:41,650
Zorme!

1212
01:39:41,651 --> 01:39:45,298
From father to son, Monge:
a family of murderers.

1213
01:40:15,532 --> 01:40:17,510
- It took you some time.
- What is this?

1214
01:40:17,511 --> 01:40:21,215
- Can’t you see?
- Of course but why? Why Marie?

1215
01:40:21,216 --> 01:40:24,767
She saw me on the night Charmaine
died. She mustn’t remember.

1216
01:40:24,768 --> 01:40:27,119
We should have killed you
25 years ago.

1217
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:31,270
But you lacked courage. You were
sure you had a hold on me.

1218
01:40:31,271 --> 01:40:34,311
But finally, I prevailed.

1219
01:40:34,312 --> 01:40:41,358
Dupin, Pujol, and now... your
daughter, who’s going to die.

1220
01:40:43,585 --> 01:40:45,017
You should have killed me
25 years ago.

1221
01:40:45,018 --> 01:40:47,859
Save Marie.
She’s guilty of nothing.

1222
01:40:47,894 --> 01:40:50,560
You’re going to suffer as I suffered.
And I'll enjoy it!

1223
01:40:50,561 --> 01:40:51,411
Save Marie.

1224
01:40:53,604 --> 01:40:55,983
Come on, shoot!

1225
01:40:55,984 --> 01:40:58,734
Your daughter is going
to die by my will.

1226
01:40:58,735 --> 01:41:00,837
- Come on: shoot.
- No!

1227
01:41:00,838 --> 01:41:04,039
Shoot!

1228
01:41:05,093 --> 01:41:08,629
I didn’t do it.
It fired on its own accord.

1229
01:41:09,494 --> 01:41:13,205
Zorme: what did you try to
have me believe, earlier? Talk.

1230
01:41:13,206 --> 01:41:15,209
Leave him be. He’s wounded.
You’re going to kill him.

1231
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:18,953
Shut up, you poor larva!

1232
01:41:18,954 --> 01:41:22,281
Do you think a baker’s bullet
can stop Zorme?

1233
01:41:27,410 --> 01:41:31,007
On the night of the crime,
when I left the well,

1234
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:33,993
I saw the three of them
in the barn.

1235
01:41:35,293 --> 01:41:37,648
They recognized me, but they
never said a word about it.

1236
01:41:37,649 --> 01:41:40,879
How could they have explained
their being there too?

1237
01:41:42,236 --> 01:41:45,270
If they didn’t kill Monge
that night,

1238
01:41:45,271 --> 01:41:47,134
it's because I did it first.

1239
01:41:50,085 --> 01:41:53,647
But why did you do it?
For money, you too?

1240
01:41:53,648 --> 01:41:58,514
Séraphin, when I came in
La Burlière,

1241
01:41:58,515 --> 01:42:01,371
Monge had already massacred
all the others.

1242
01:42:01,372 --> 01:42:04,570
He had just slit
your mother’s throat.

1243
01:42:05,582 --> 01:42:09,481
She was still moving.
Crawling toward you.

1244
01:42:09,482 --> 01:42:12,897
Because Monge had already lifted
your head to be sure to get you.

1245
01:42:14,628 --> 01:42:17,433
I jumped him. We fought.

1246
01:42:17,434 --> 01:42:21,571
And when I stabbed him with
the spit, he was still insulting me.

1247
01:42:21,572 --> 01:42:23,291
You killed him in order
to save me?

1248
01:42:23,292 --> 01:42:26,523
I was mad with jealousy.

1249
01:42:28,441 --> 01:42:34,546
Your mother...
We loved each other.

1250
01:42:36,269 --> 01:42:39,093
I never looked at
another woman again.

1251
01:42:43,890 --> 01:42:48,594
But then...

1252
01:42:48,595 --> 01:42:52,496
- the parcels during the war,
that was you? - Yes.

1253
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:57,233
I didn’t want you to become
a murderer.

1254
01:42:57,234 --> 01:43:00,849
When I discovered in your home
the papers you had found,

1255
01:43:00,850 --> 01:43:02,581
I understood what you
were going to do.

1256
01:43:02,582 --> 01:43:05,325
So I killed them for you.

1257
01:43:05,326 --> 01:43:07,972
I wanted you, at least,
to escape fate.

1258
01:43:07,973 --> 01:43:11,011
But why Charmaine?
She was not responsible.

1259
01:43:11,012 --> 01:43:13,644
You were at her mercy.

1260
01:43:13,645 --> 01:43:18,005
I don’t have anything to tell men,
but I can talk to beasts.

1261
01:43:18,006 --> 01:43:21,781
To dogs. And even to the stones
in your house, to shut up foreigners.

1262
01:43:25,408 --> 01:43:28,995
For 25 years I’ve been living
here alone. Do you understand?

1263
01:43:28,996 --> 01:43:32,603
Everything stopped when
your mother died.

1264
01:43:32,604 --> 01:43:37,660
Séraphin: you’re the only
important thing in my life.

1265
01:43:42,626 --> 01:43:44,323
You forced me
to shoot, Zorme.

1266
01:43:44,324 --> 01:43:48,602
I’m going to be arrested, I’m done
for, so your vengeance is over.

1267
01:43:48,603 --> 01:43:52,161
Marie’s death is useless now.
Save her.

1268
01:43:52,162 --> 01:43:55,049
I’m too weak now.

1269
01:43:59,223 --> 01:44:01,784
Everybody here knew
you were Zorme’s son.

1270
01:45:02,771 --> 01:45:10,427
Marie, my little one.
My child. You’re saved.

1271
01:45:10,428 --> 01:45:12,962
It’s over.

1272
01:45:19,172 --> 01:45:22,794
<i>If you marry a woman here,
you’ll bring her misery.</i>

1273
01:45:22,795 --> 01:45:26,226
<i>I don’t have anything
to do here anymore.</i>

1274
01:45:26,227 --> 01:45:29,418
<i>You’ll always be a stranger
because they’ll always be cowards.</i>

1275
01:45:29,419 --> 01:45:32,219
<i>They’ll choke you like a remorse.</i>

1276
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:36,953
<i>Go, Séraphin. I didn’t want you
to become a murderer.</i>

1277
01:45:36,954 --> 01:45:40,585
<i>I wanted you, at least,
to escape fate.</i>

1278
01:45:53,479 --> 01:45:57,313
Séraphin. Séraphin,
wait for me.

1279
