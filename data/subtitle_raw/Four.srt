1
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,621
Hey, June.

2
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,756
Come have some food.

3
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,094
I think I'm gonna go 
watch the fireworks.

4
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,096
You want to go out?

5
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,265
Yeah, I'm gonna go out.

6
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:06,766
Okay.

7
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,235
Call if you need anything.

8
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,614
Dexter...

9
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,651
How you gonna satisfy me?

10
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,356
Uh, not like that.

11
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,796
Listen Dexter, I gotta go.

12
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,266
Because.

13
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,505
Look, I'll talk to you later.

14
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,273
Bye.

15
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,448
Dexter! You in there?!

16
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,918
You better get some ribs 
while there's some left!

17
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,453
No, ma. I'm good.

18
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,366
Fucking mirrors, man.

19
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:54,807
â™ª

20
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,350
Ow!

21
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,919
[phone rings]

22
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,591
Hello?

23
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:27,627
Hey.

24
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,462
Yeah.

25
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,698
On time.

26
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,605
Plaid shirt.

27
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,107
No one is here.

28
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,912
Okay. Cool.

29
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:19,979
June?

30
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:27,987
Hi there.

31
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,422
Hey.

32
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,061
My God...

33
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,729
What a wasteland.

34
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,100
My car.

35
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:45,037
Oh, yeah. Okay.

36
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:47,974
You okay?

37
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,777
Yeah, yeah...

38
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:55,081
I used to shop here.

39
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,853
It was a Marshall's. Anyway...

40
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,190
Oh, okay. Well...

41
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,494
Yeah.

42
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,231
Let's go.

43
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,916
So, on the road.

44
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,518
Yeah.

45
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,020
I love driving.

46
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,123
Driving gotta be the most 
America thing there is.

47
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,026
You having a good 
Fourth of July?

48
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,828
Yeah. It's fine.

49
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,165
Fourth of July.

50
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,601
- Like apple pie. 
- Huh?

51
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,636
Driving...

52
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,139
You said it was the most 
American thing there is.

53
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,641
Like apple pie.

54
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,076
Oh... Yeah.

55
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,213
We might be able to see 
some fireworks tonight.

56
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,181
Where?

57
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,316
It's the Fourth of July...

58
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,751
Fireworks everywhere.

59
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,019
It's illegal here.

60
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,254
Illegal?

61
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,323
That's the other American thing.

62
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,158
What?

63
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,827
Breaking the law.

64
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:58,271
You know, 
we're breaking the law.

65
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,338
We are?

66
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,576
This state still 
has adultery laws.

67
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,078
We're having an affair?

68
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,783
So do I look like 
the sound of my voice?

69
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,019
Yeah, I guess.

70
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,154
This how you imagined me?

71
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,889
Yeah, I guess.

72
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,324
I didn't really 
imagine anything.

73
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:20,326
You look a lot like 
I imagined you.

74
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,629
You're a cutie.

75
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:24,730
Whatever.

76
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,338
I was thinking we could 
go see a movie tonight.

77
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,706
Oh, yeah?

78
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,376
What's your favorite?

79
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,780
I don't really 
have any favorites.

80
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:42,715
Come on, you have to have 
a favorite movie.

81
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,885
I haven't thought about it much. 
I'd have to think about it.

82
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,752
Okay. Favorite books?

83
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:50,423
You're like an expert. 
I feel stupid.

84
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,391
C'mon. Don't be scared of me.

85
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,695
You're not intimidated 
by me, are you?

86
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,167
I like Truman Capote.

87
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,403
Minor, minor, minor.

88
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,205
Well, what are your 
favorite books?

89
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,341
No. Tell me more of yours.

90
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,943
I was just joking.

91
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,311
I like Truman Capote.

92
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,280
Breakfast at Tiffany's - 
that was a great book.

93
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:15,815
Gore Vidal?

94
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,317
Do you read 
any straight writers?

95
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,289
You gotta be proud of yourself. 
You gotta believe in yourself.

96
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:27,326
You say 'I like Truman Capote', 
say 'I LOVE Truman Capote'.

97
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,895
Say it with force.

98
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,298
Say it with flare. 
Present yourself.

99
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,333
Make people listen.

100
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,870
You gotta come out 
from behind that computer.

101
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,438
- You with me? 
- Okay.

102
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,208
You need some confidence, 
some cockiness.

103
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,176
A little America.

104
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,313
I don't really like America.

105
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,147
What?!

106
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,917
America has done 
a lot of bad things.

107
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,219
Who hasn't?

108
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,721
It's just by 
wanting to be the best.

109
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,224
Okay. No more politics.

110
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,226
You're making me angry.

111
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,293
Sorry.

112
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,835
I'm gonna give you the most

113
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,238
American Fourth of July 
you've ever had.

114
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,240
What do you have 
to say about that?

115
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,209
[car engine revs faster]

116
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,412
It's all about excess!

117
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,349
Being big! Being loud! 
You with me?!

118
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,752
AMERICA! GOD BLESS AMERICA!

119
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,823
That's better.

120
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,657
Scream something.

121
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,294
I don't scream. 
That's not my style.

122
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,263
On the count of three.

123
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,799
1, 2, 3...

124
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,878
I see. Okay.

125
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,455
We'll make you scream 
a little later.

126
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,128
You are not coming over.

127
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,563
You're picking me up!

128
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,298
I have work to do.

129
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,903
I gotta be here 
when my dad calls.

130
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,773
At a conference in Boston.

131
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,909
[clanging nearby]

132
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,244
Hold on.

133
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,783
Dexter, I gotta go.

134
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,355
Mommy?

135
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,928
What time is it?

136
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,430
Almost there.

137
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,098
Cool.

138
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,033
Sure you don't want anything?

139
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,335
Yeah. I'm pretty full.

140
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,303
When did you eat?

141
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,338
Before I left.

142
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,539
What did you have?

143
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:56,542
Just, you know... 
Hot dog, whatever.

144
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,244
One hot dog?

145
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,378
Yeah.

146
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,615
How are you full on one hot dog?

147
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,250
I'm okay.

148
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,357
So why did they name you June?

149
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,325
Were you supposed to be 
conceived in June?

150
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:17,496
No, I was supposed 
to be born in June.

151
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,931
Supposed?

152
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,332
Yeah, well...

153
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,601
I was born in April.

154
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,336
I was six weeks premature.

155
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,205
I was supposed to be 
born in June,

156
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,107
so they named me June.

157
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,143
You do a lot of acting?

158
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,578
No...

159
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:36,348
I've had a few shows, 
a few roles. Mostly chorus.

160
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,188
And why haven't you 
come out to your parents?

161
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,091
I don't know.

162
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,961
Do you love them?

163
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,496
Yeah. A lot.

164
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,630
I love my parents.

165
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,499
We all do. 
So, why don't you tell them?

166
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,668
- Because I can't. 
- Why not?

167
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,536
I don't want to. I don't know.

168
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,271
Are you waiting 
until you have a boyfriend?

169
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,906
I don't think 
I'll ever tell them.

170
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,907
Why?

171
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,542
I don't know!

172
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,117
'Cause I'm the only son.

173
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,454
I know my mom wants grandkids.

174
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,924
I don't really 
feel right about...

175
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,492
About being gay.

176
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,162
I don't like that word.

177
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,997
- What word? 
- Gay.

178
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,699
- Queer? 
- Shh.

179
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,133
You know people here?

180
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,969
I might. I don't know.

181
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:40,312
It was my dad's idea 
to name me June.

182
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:43,382
My mom wanted to 
name me Franklin.

183
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,589
So what do they do?

184
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,026
My dad works for the state,

185
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,695
the Department 
of Transportation.

186
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:01,567
He studies 
traffic patterns and stuff.

187
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,535
Helps retime stop lights.

188
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,504
And my mom is 
a dental assistant.

189
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,045
You must have 
sparkling teeth then.

190
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,481
Not really.

191
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,685
I do love them...

192
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,221
A lot. I just...

193
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,228
Does anyone know?

194
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,463
Well, you.

195
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,665
Me?

196
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,970
Beautiful.

197
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,605
What?

198
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,275
The lights go down.

199
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,612
Like sinking into 
a collective dream.

200
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,149
Suddenly, you're anonymous.

201
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:59,525
You get that sexual charge.

202
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,196
Charge of excitement.

203
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,237
Anticipation.

204
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,277
Danger.

205
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,147
Hold this.

206
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,787
Welcome to Cinemark.

207
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,390
Remember to visit 
our concessions stand.

208
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,259
Please silence your cell phones 
and enjoy the show.

209
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,202
[phone rings]

210
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:45,804
Hello?

211
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,139
Hey, baby.

212
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,841
Hi, Daddy!

213
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,275
Happy Fourth of July!

214
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,643
Happy Fourth of July 
to you too.

215
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,545
How's she doing?

216
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,748
She's okay. She's asleep.

217
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:00,152
Okay. Good.

218
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,453
How's the conference?

219
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,189
Quite a spot 
on the Fourth of July.

220
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,825
A lot of pride here. 
A lot of white pride.

221
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,560
Boston's such a white city.

222
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,130
That's why Daddy loves it. 
I stand out here.

223
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,431
You making people mad?

224
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,133
I'm making people listen.

225
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,468
So, yeah, 
I'm making people mad.

226
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:19,638
What are you doing tonight?

227
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:20,806
Just staying in.

228
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,810
Thank you, for taking care 
of your mother.

229
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,645
It's no problem.

230
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,313
I wish I could be there.

231
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,383
You know how much 
it means to me.

232
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,819
Where are you? It's loud.

233
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,222
[people chattering]

234
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,127
Hotel lobby, honey.

235
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,198
Sounds like...

236
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,900
Remember when we used to 
go to the movies

237
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,768
on the Fourth of July?

238
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,107
Daddy?

239
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,109
Yeah, baby?

240
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,911
Nothing.

241
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,612
Should I call you later?

242
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,347
No, don't call; 
it will wake her up.

243
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,615
I love you, baby.

244
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,616
I love you too.

245
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,651
Bye, bye.

246
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:06,685
Bye.

247
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,342
Dexter, what you doing?

248
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,482
If you wanna come pick me up 
for a little while, you can.

249
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,452
But only for like 15 minutes.

250
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,855
Yeah, baby. 
Fifteen minutes all I need.

251
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,890
You're so nasty.

252
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,462
Just come, okay?

253
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,165
Alright, I'll be right there.

254
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:54,867
Bye.

255
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,750
So, why'd you change your mind?

256
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,354
Changed my mind. No reason.

257
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,524
There's always a reason.

258
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,528
So, you can get off 
this subject now.

259
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,697
Wow. Okay.

260
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,865
If you're gonna act all bitchy, 
I'll take you home.

261
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,701
You'll take me however I am.

262
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,002
And don't call me a bitch.

263
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,338
- I did not call you a bitch. 
- Yes, you did.

264
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,039
I said you were acting bitchy.

265
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,609
I wouldn't call you a bitch. 
I never call a woman a bitch.

266
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:44,776
You call 
your mother a bitch.

267
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,278
That's my mother.

268
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:52,684
Alright. Starting over. 
Commercial break. La-di-da.

269
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,055
Where you wanna go? 
You wanna go to the park?

270
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,658
I don't like the park.

271
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,293
Then where?

272
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,428
You don't wanna 
see the fireworks.

273
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,397
Don't wanna go to the park.

274
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,299
Where you wanna go?

275
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,434
Don't wanna go nowhere.

276
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,603
I hate this town.

277
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,574
You told me on the computer 
the first night we met.

278
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,978
You said you had a friend 
you used to fool around with?

279
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,380
Yeah.

280
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,781
What was his name?

281
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,816
Todd.

282
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,552
Todd... That's right.

283
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,423
How come you don't 
speak to him anymore?

284
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,992
I just never really...

285
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,330
Once middle school came, 
he started acting weird.

286
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,566
Like a faggot?

287
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,734
Yeah, I guess.

288
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,540
Wearing flamboyant clothes?

289
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:49,875
Yeah...

290
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,644
And he started 
hanging out with all girls.

291
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,550
I wonder what 
he's doing tonight?

292
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,019
He's probably out. 
I know he goes to Chez.

293
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,623
- The bar Chez? 
- Yeah.

294
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,559
And they don't beat the shit 
out of him at school?

295
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,828
I guess people 
just leave him alone

296
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,997
because he's too weird 
or something.

297
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,868
Do people leave you alone?

298
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,804
Yeah, I guess.

299
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,640
I don't really talk a lot.

300
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,713
- Wanna go and see him? 
- No!

301
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:30,048
C'mon! 
We're only five minutes away.

302
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,616
I don't want to do that.

303
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,852
So you're not scared 
to meet some guy

304
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,154
you just met 
on the computer.

305
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,989
But you're scared 
to see someone--

306
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,925
- I don't want to know him. 
- Why not?

307
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,526
I don't know.

308
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:46,431
When we were 13, 
he was still pretty normal.

309
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,768
I know 'cause, 
he used to be on the swim team

310
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,069
and I used to dive.

311
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:54,539
I wasn't really talking 
to him or anything.

312
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,908
We had this swim coach,

313
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,177
and he was 
the diving coach too...

314
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,814
I had a funny feeling 
about him.

315
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,751
- Fag? 
- Yeah.

316
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:06,985
[chuckling]

317
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,954
What?

318
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,222
No, go on.

319
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,824
I'm anticipating the story.

320
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,760
Go on.

321
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:25,103
One night my mom was really 
late to pick me up.

322
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:32,177
And I saw Ted give Todd 
a ride home in his car...

323
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,113
which coaches, I mean,

324
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,549
you're not supposed to.

325
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:44,990
It was making me really mad, 
like I didn't know what to do.

326
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,225
I decided to give him a call -

327
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:51,696
to see, like... 
Just to see if he was home.

328
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,167
And I don't 
know why or anything.

329
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,537
I just said, like meanly, like,

330
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,506
'You're gay, aren't you?'

331
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,908
And then I hung up.

332
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:05,977
You hung up?

333
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,746
I hung up...

334
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,651
And I never spoke 
to him again after that.

335
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:16,054
I don't know if he knew 
if it was me or not,

336
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,089
but I just never...

337
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,992
I hated him after that.

338
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,194
You hated him?

339
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,496
Yeah. I just... 
I don't know.

340
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,706
Okay, June...

341
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:36,942
Where do you 
want to go right now?

342
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,578
Where do I want to go?

343
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,079
Okay, just tell me.

344
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,648
C'mon. Just tell me.

345
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:44,816
This is your night.

346
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,552
You're the young man, 
I'm the old man.

347
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,087
Tell me.

348
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,240
Coach Donavan said 
he thinks I'm like the best

349
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:11,810
Division II player 
he's ever seen.

350
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,645
Says he wants to 
give me a transfer

351
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,846
to a Division I school.

352
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,049
But that my grades 
are a little bit bad.

353
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,087
Plus, my record.

354
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,289
But apparently some schools 
are still interested,

355
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:27,225
so, you know, that's cool.

356
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,127
Which schools?

357
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,162
A couple. 
Watch this...

358
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,232
Oh, God!

359
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,800
Showoff.

360
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,138
So tell me...

361
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,107
Why'd you change your mind?

362
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:43,909
Felt like it.

363
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,044
Yeah?

364
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,748
I know I'm a white boy and you 
ain't into that kind of thing.

365
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,284
Half white, half spic. 
Don't sell yourself short.

366
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,818
Oh!

367
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,887
You're a little bit racist!

368
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,691
I mean, apparently you ain't 
into either one.

369
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,226
I never said that.

370
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,163
That I'm not into white boys. 
I never said that.

371
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:06,998
So then tell me...

372
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,602
You think I'm cute?

373
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,370
You think I'm handsome?

374
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,307
You think I'm pretty?

375
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,010
You can tell me. C'mon!

376
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:21,880
I don't like your questions.

377
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,883
What if I told you...

378
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,286
I think you're pretty?

379
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,057
I'd accept the complement.

380
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,963
What if I told you

381
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,765
I think that you 
are beautiful?

382
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,869
I think that you 
are beautiful chocolate.

383
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,305
You just ruined it 
by calling me chocolate.

384
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:52,210
What if I told you 
I think you're beautiful -

385
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,379
no chocolate?

386
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,715
Even though it's delicious.

387
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:00,285
I know you're intentions. 
You know that, right?

388
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,320
You know you ain't fooling me.

389
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,022
I don't got no intentions.

390
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,306
I mean, fuck that. 
I'm here with you right.

391
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,907
You were saying.

392
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,743
I wasn't saying anything.

393
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,279
You were saying that...

394
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,849
you think that 
I'm cute sometimes.

395
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,718
Yeah?

396
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,054
Yeah.

397
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,690
Alright, so then when?

398
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,059
When do you think I'm cute?

399
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,333
When you're smiling 
like a little boy.

400
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,434
You think I'm like 
a little boy?

401
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,303
Sometimes.

402
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,809
You don't get it...

403
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,744
It's hard to talk to you.

404
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,715
You think I'm stupid, 
don't you?

405
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:05,917
You do.

406
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,056
You think I'm like at home 
playing with Legos,

407
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,291
puttin' my finger 
up my nose and shit.

408
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:19,264
You think I'm not 
good enough for you.

409
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,368
That I can't understand 
your thoughts,

410
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,236
or whatever is going on 
in your head.

411
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,440
I got thoughts too.

412
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,743
Watch.

413
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,914
Before the night is out...

414
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,749
you're gonna 
tell me your thoughts.

415
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,057
I wish you did want 
to see the fireworks.

416
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,530
But you don't wanna do that.

417
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,536
That's okay, 
maybe we could stay here.

418
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:05,577
That's cool too. We can see 
the sky get all bright...

419
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:09,848
Watch the clouds light up... 
That's cool too.

420
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,929
I used to love coming here.

421
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,564
Everybody loved me.

422
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,068
Everybody knew who I was. 
I played basketball.

423
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,836
I was the leading scorer.

424
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,973
They wrote about me 
in the newspaper.

425
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:40,311
The only thing I didn't 
like to do was confession.

426
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,880
I hated that shit.

427
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,116
You believe in God?

428
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,023
I believe in God.

429
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:57,328
I don't got no reason not too. 
I don't know why I wouldn't.

430
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:00,365
My dad didn't believe in God, 
look at that bitch.

431
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,234
He's fat and toothless.

432
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,136
Don't talk about 
your dad that way.

433
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,238
Don't tell me how to 
talk about my dad.

434
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:11,042
[fireworks popping]

435
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,978
Some kids gettin' 
an early start!

436
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,561
What you kissing me for?

437
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,371
You okay?

438
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,282
â™ª

439
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,456
You are so warm.

440
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,993
Let's go.

441
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:06,064
Where?

442
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:07,298
Your house.

443
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,434
My house? 
Why don't we go to your house?

444
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:10,668
I wanna go. C'mon.

445
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,136
Wait, wait. Come here.

446
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,438
Give me another kiss.

447
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,617
I wanna go.

448
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,921
Damn. You are so warm.

449
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,623
Dexter.

450
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,692
Okay. Okay.

451
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:42,600
Wait, wait.

452
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,470
Thank you.

453
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,940
I love motels, I love 'em.

454
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,942
Why?

455
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:54,012
Just do. Just love 'em.

456
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,514
There always here. Always open.

457
00:31:57,615 --> 00:32:01,119
TV. Shower. Phone.

458
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,422
The essential tools of living

459
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,491
in a completely 
anonymous setting.

460
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:09,193
You can re-invent yourself.

461
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,030
And this book...

462
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:15,967
The greatest book ever.

463
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,137
The Bible is 
the greatest book ever?

464
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,639
It's inspired and enraged 
so many people.

465
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,241
That's what makes it 
the best book.

466
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,510
I hate going to church.

467
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:26,744
Why do you go then?

468
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,746
My parents go. 
We've always gone.

469
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,015
Turn on the TV.

470
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:41,259
You know, I bet motels 
are one of the few places

471
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,661
people feel comfortable 
reading the Bible.

472
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,698
Anything on?

473
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:47,999
Not much.

474
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,769
Turn it off.

475
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,292
I'm just gonna take a shower.

476
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,395
Why do you have to 
take a shower?

477
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,697
I want to.

478
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,067
- You nervous? 
- No.

479
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:25,336
I'll put you at ease.

480
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,673
No. I just feel...

481
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,614
I'm not clean.

482
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,184
I feel a little sweaty.

483
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:43,421
Okay. It's up to you.

484
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:45,356
I'll just...

485
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,091
I'll be quick.

486
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:56,167
I volunteer 
a couple days a week.

487
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,835
At the University.

488
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,838
I see a lot of kids 
in trouble these days.

489
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,340
Sad kids.

490
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,243
I didn't seem that sad 
when I was growing up.

491
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:10,214
We learned to keep a lot inside. 
We didn't expect too much.

492
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,352
Maybe that was...

493
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,320
a good thing, you know.

494
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:23,127
The other day 
I was with this man.

495
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,132
And he was very poor.

496
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,768
He was on food stamps 
and welfare.

497
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,570
And he's white.

498
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,308
He'd just had it.

499
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,213
He's a little older than me.

500
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,315
Graduated from high school.

501
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,284
But he hadn't gone to college.

502
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:47,718
And he had a family.

503
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,124
Can you hear me in there?!

504
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:55,660
Yeah!!

505
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,629
Well, he had a family.

506
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,532
And he lost his family. 
He left them.

507
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,135
And he married another woman.

508
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,537
And then he left her too.

509
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,906
And then he stopped 
trying to be married.

510
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:14,212
He wanted to... 
be on his own.

511
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,414
He wanted to do 
what he wanted to do.

512
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,483
The work that I do -

513
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,952
it's a counseling center. 
It's a health center.

514
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,653
I see a lot of kids.

515
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,589
It's a surprise to see

516
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,557
an older person - 
especially a man.

517
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,660
And he's there 
getting his blood tested.

518
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:33,631
And as we were talking...

519
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,536
I started to realize.

520
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:43,441
I started... 
to remember this man.

521
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:48,412
Well, I realized this...

522
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:52,383
was the first man I slept with.

523
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:57,221
I remember because he had a scar 
on the bottom of his left ear.

524
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:01,225
It looked like a snake, 
I remember thinking.

525
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,334
It was the 80s.

526
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:16,407
And I was going through 
a rough point at that time.

527
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,649
The good thing 
about this disease

528
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,885
is that it makes most people

529
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:31,789
start thinking about sex 
instead of just having it.

530
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,391
You know what I'm saying?

531
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:42,466
Many people start thinking 
about the other person

532
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,635
and what they may have 
inside of them.

533
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,777
I think....

534
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,448
this disease is the best thing 
that ever happened

535
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,318
to gay men because...

536
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,653
in a certain sense 
it has made us human.

537
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,026
But I could go on forever 
about this.

538
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,029
I'm getting away from the story.

539
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,664
Are you interested?!

540
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,700
I'll stop. I'll stop talking.

541
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,402
Can you hear me?!

542
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:22,273
No...uh... Keep going.

543
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:29,513
I didn't bring it up to him, 
of course.

544
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,351
I look different.

545
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,723
He wouldn't recognize me.

546
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,975
I started thinking about...

547
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:02,346
the myths of first love, 
first sex.

548
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,016
How for gay boys of today...

549
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:08,586
their first AIDS test 
is the equivalent of

550
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,989
a straight boy 
losing his virginity.

551
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,064
What's wrong?

552
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,732
Nothing.

553
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,635
You're all dressed. 
Did you shower?

554
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,109
Are you okay?

555
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,778
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

556
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,479
I just...

557
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,856
This is a mistake, isn't it?

558
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,758
- No! 
- Let's not do this.

559
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,160
You don't have to do this.

560
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,895
I just... 
I don't know.

561
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:51,929
I'll take you home.

562
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,765
- I don't want to go home. 
- What do you want?

563
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:03,040
I'm sorry.

564
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,052
I'm horny.

565
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:18,789
You're what?

566
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:27,465
I'm horny.

567
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,841
What do you want, June?

568
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,457
June, June, June...

569
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,197
You are beautiful.

570
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:42,039
You are beautiful.

571
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,775
You beautiful boy.

572
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,555
Nah, ma. We're good.

573
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,525
See, I told you 
your place was better.

574
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,769
It's a little...messy.

575
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,539
EntrÃ©. EntrÃ©, madam.

576
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,641
You can sit down if you like.

577
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,618
You saw what 
I was talking about, right?

578
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,721
The neighborhood, it's mixed.

579
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,056
What do you mean?

580
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:36,627
That I grew up in. 
We have black people and shit.

581
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,568
You know what's funny, though?

582
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,804
I talk like I'm black, right?

583
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,874
And you talk like 
you're a white girl.

584
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,910
I do not talk like a white girl.

585
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,246
What you mean, you don't? 
Your mama white?

586
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,548
No! She's black!

587
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,917
Damn, girl. 
Why you say it like that?

588
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:00,985
Like what?

589
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,288
Like you angry or some shit.

590
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,958
You got a nice room.

591
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,729
It's small, but it's cozy,

592
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,797
Little Miss Change-the-Subject.

593
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,099
All these posters.

594
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,802
I wish I was black.

595
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,939
I do...

596
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,108
Sometimes I just 
wish I was black.

597
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:31,582
What?

598
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:49,546
You alright?

599
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,185
Yeah.

600
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:00,324
I'm ready to go home.

601
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,067
How come you ain't talkin'?

602
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:13,971
You're not talkin' either.

603
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,375
You could have taken 
the left-over barbecue.

604
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:19,576
It was good.

605
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:22,079
I don't eat meat.

606
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:31,989
Maybe tomorrow you want 
to go see a movie?

607
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:33,824
I have to work.

608
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,160
Where you work at?

609
00:46:36,894 --> 00:46:40,164
Things around the house. 
Help out my mom.

610
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:42,065
And my father's coming home.

611
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:47,070
You haven't said anything.

612
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:48,305
Hmm?

613
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,408
You haven't said 
anything about it.

614
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,587
Was it okay?

615
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,657
No, um...

616
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,959
Yeah... it was. I just...

617
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,562
- I mean, was it okay? 
- Yes. Yes.

618
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,167
I'm sorry that I...

619
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:22,506
It's okay, June.

620
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,878
Your mother ever let people 
come over the house?

621
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,548
She doesn't like it.

622
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:34,051
I think it makes her sad.

623
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,519
Why is that?

624
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:38,889
She doesn't want to be reminded.

625
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,026
Of what?

626
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,430
Other people.

627
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:53,637
I don't understand.

628
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,441
You don't have to.

629
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:02,179
Damn. Fine.

630
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:06,984
â™ª

631
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,249
You okay?

632
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:15,752
Pull over here.

633
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,087
Why? What happened?

634
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,188
Just do it!

635
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:36,707
You okay? 
You sick or something?

636
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,774
Shut up!

637
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:55,759
Hey, baby.

638
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,563
Hello? Abigayle?

639
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,133
Hello? Are you there?

640
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,342
Drive.

641
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:15,812
- Where? 
- Just drive, okay!

642
00:50:22,552 --> 00:50:26,390
â™ª

643
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:44,875
Time to make a decision.

644
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:46,443
It's up to you, really.

645
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,312
Okay.

646
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:51,782
We are going to...Chez.

647
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:52,783
No!

648
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:55,118
Oh, alright!

649
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:56,887
An answer! Emphatic at that!

650
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,321
I just don't want to go there.

651
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:00,524
- You're scared-- 
- I'm not!

652
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:16,640
What's up? Can I come in?

653
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,677
Dexter, my mom is sleeping.

654
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,345
I promise I'll be quiet.

655
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:24,114
No.

656
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,716
C'mon. I let you come over.

657
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,268
Five minutes.

658
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,370
Dexter, no!

659
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:49,272
Five minutes, 
I promise I'll be quiet!

660
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:54,211
I'll start screaming.

661
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,480
I'll start screaming.

662
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:58,782
Your neighbors will think you're 
getting raped or something.

663
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:01,418
You just won't quit, will you?

664
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,720
Help! Somebody help me!

665
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,489
Five minutes.

666
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:07,390
Don't say a word.

667
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,559
I promise.

668
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:38,755
[crowd chattering]

669
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,608
Two cokes.

670
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,956
Can we go now, please?

671
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:14,591
Give me a few minutes--

672
00:53:14,624 --> 00:53:17,761
I did what you wanted. 
I'm not scared.

673
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:19,796
What do I have to 
prove to you anyway?

674
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,405
June?

675
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,516
Why don't you say something?

676
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,450
I'm leaving.

677
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:43,420
- You should talk to him. 
- I'm leaving.

678
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:44,354
Fuck!

679
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:46,856
Fuck you!

680
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:49,526
June?

681
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:57,601
Wow! What are you doing here?

682
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:02,505
Hi. I'm Joe.

683
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,274
Todd.

684
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:07,444
- Nice to meet you. 
- Likewise.

685
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:15,418
I can't believe it! 
It's so good to see you.

686
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:21,725
We have some beer and stuff, 
maybe you'd want to...

687
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,294
June!

688
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:36,640
Go away! Leave me alone! 
Leave me alone!

689
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:37,707
What do you want?!

690
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,075
I told you, I don't know!

691
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,810
Well, answer that!

692
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:42,746
And then you'll know 
where you're going!

693
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,948
It's not like I can choose!

694
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:48,084
It's not like I can choose 
to be skinny like that,

695
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,986
or handsome or whatever!

696
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,421
Let me tell you what you want.

697
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,789
Tell me what?!

698
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:54,557
What you want, 
what will make you happy.

699
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:56,026
You can't tell me 
what I want!

700
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:58,928
You want...a boyfriend.

701
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,697
You want to be in love.

702
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,633
You want someone 
sleeping next to you.

703
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:04,934
You want someone to 
stroke your head.

704
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,637
You cry yourself to sleep, 
don't you?

705
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:10,073
You spend four hours 
on the computer,

706
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:11,374
looking for someone to meet.

707
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:13,109
You want someone 
to make you feel real,

708
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,444
someone to touch you.

709
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,979
You don't know what I want!

710
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:17,614
I'm being honest with you.

711
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:19,749
I care about you.

712
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:21,685
Maybe I should go!

713
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,055
June.

714
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:28,491
Let me go! Let me go!

715
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,640
Come over here and sit down.

716
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:22,112
Alright.

717
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,172
When I was little...

718
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:51,574
When I was four.

719
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,580
What's wrong with her?

720
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:01,184
She's just weak.

721
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:05,088
Just got weak.

722
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:07,157
So, she's just weak then?

723
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,658
Yeah.

724
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,699
What about your pop? 
Is he cool?

725
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:20,603
He's a good man.

726
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:24,574
He loves me, he works hard.

727
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:25,942
Not much to say.

728
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:27,644
He travels a lot.

729
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,514
That's cool. 
Where does he travel to?

730
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:33,650
I don't really want 
to talk about it, okay?

731
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:36,152
Alright.

732
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:52,802
[phone ringing]

733
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:53,870
- I'm sorry. 
- It's okay.

734
00:57:57,774 --> 00:57:59,008
Times up.

735
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:00,143
I'm sorry.

736
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:03,746
Can I use your bathroom?

737
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,582
Dexter...

738
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:10,553
I promise you, that's it. 
I'm gone.

739
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,158
Across the hall.

740
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:44,821
[door screeching]

741

742
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:11,274
Oh...

743
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:13,743
I'm sorry...

744
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,712
I came out of the bathroom,

745
01:00:15,745 --> 01:00:19,282
and I heard a noise over here, 
I just...

746
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:26,422
Fuck you! You fucking loser!

747
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:29,359
Stop it! Stop it!

748
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,661
I'm sorry!

749
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:40,169
I'm sorry.

750
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:27,784
What's this?

751
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:30,286
It's me, my mom, and my pops -

752
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:33,256
when I was eight, 
after a basketball game.

753
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,427
My dad used to 
teach me basketball.

754
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:41,130
I want you to keep it.

755
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:44,000
Why should I keep this?

756
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,875
You're gonna miss the fireworks.

757
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,977
I don't wanna go 
to the fireworks.

758
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:01,050
I don't want this.

759
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:24,433
Thanks.

760
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:26,602
Hold on.

761
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:31,340
What?

762
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:40,016
I got you something.

763
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:46,088
What did you get?

764
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:48,057
It's just a little something.

765
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,501
Don't look now.

766
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:03,406
Okay.

767
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:12,882

Hello?

Hi, it's me.

771
01:05:16,612 --> 01:05:19,282
I'll be back in a little while.

772
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:23,452
I'm watching them right now...

773
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,621
with some friends.

774
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:27,623
Yeah.

What do you want?

779
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,675
Do you want some water?

780
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:28,684
Go look at 
the fireworks outside?

781
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:37,493
Do you want anything?
