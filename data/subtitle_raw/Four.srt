00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,504
And my mom is 
a dental assistant.

189
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,045
You must have 
sparkling teeth then.

190
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,481
Not really.

191
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,685
I do love them...

192
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:22,221
A lot. I just...

193
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,228
Does anyone know?

194
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,463
Well, you.

195
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,665
Me?

196
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,970
Beautiful.

197
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,605
What?

198
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:43,275
The lights go down.

199
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,612
Like sinking into 
a collective dream.

200
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:50,149
Suddenly, you're anonymous.

201
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:59,525
You get that sexual charge.

202
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,196
Charge of excitement.

203
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,237
Anticipation.

204
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,277
Danger.

205
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,147
Hold this.

206
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,787
Welcome to Cinemark.

207
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,390
Remember to visit 
our concessions stand.

208
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,259
Please silence your cell phones 
and enjoy the show.

209
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,202
[phone rings]

210
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:45,804
Hello?

211
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,139
Hey, baby.

212
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,841
Hi, Daddy!

213
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,275
Happy Fourth of July!

214
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,643
Happy Fourth of July 
to you too.

215
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:53,545
How's she doing?

216
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,748
She's okay. She's asleep.

217
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:00,152
Okay. Good.

218
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,453
How's the conference?

219
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,189
Quite a spot 
on the Fourth of July.

220
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,825
A lot of pride here. 
A lot of white pride.

221
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,560
Boston's such a white city.

222
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,130
That's why Daddy loves it. 
I stand out here.

223
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,431
You making people mad?

224
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,133
I'm making people listen.

225
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,468
So, yeah, 
I'm making people mad.

226
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:19,638
What are you doing tonight?

227
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:20,806
Just staying in.

228
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,810
Thank you, for taking care 
of your mother.

229
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,645
It's no problem.

230
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,313
I wish I could be there.

231
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,383
You know how much 
it means to me.

232
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,819
Where are you? It's loud.

233
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,222
[people chattering]

234
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,127
Hotel lobby, honey.

235
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,198
Sounds like...

236
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,900
Remember when we used to 
go to the movies

237
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,768
on the Fourth of July?

238
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:55,107
Daddy?

239
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,109
Yeah, baby?

240
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,911
Nothing.

241
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,612
Should I call you later?

242
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,347
No, don't call; 
it will wake her up.

243
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,615
I love you, baby.

244
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,616
I love you too.

245
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,651
Bye, bye.

246
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:06,685
Bye.

247
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,342
Dexter, what you doing?

248
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:36,482
If you wanna come pick me up 
for a little while, you can.

249
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,452
But only for like 15 minutes.

250
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,855
Yeah, baby. 
Fifteen minutes all I need.

251
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,890
You're so nasty.

252
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,462
Just come, okay?

253
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,165
Alright, I'll be right there.

254
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:54,867
Bye.

255
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,750
So, why'd you change your mind?

256
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,354
Changed my mind. No reason.

257
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,524
There's always a reason.

258
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,528
So, you can get off 
this subject now.

259
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,697
Wow. Okay.

260
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,865
If you're gonna act all bitchy, 
I'll take you home.

261
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,701
You'll take me however I am.

262
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,002
And don't call me a bitch.

263
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,338
- I did not call you a bitch. 
- Yes, you did.

264
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,039
I said you were acting bitchy.

265
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,609
I wouldn't call you a bitch. 
I never call a woman a bitch.

266
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:44,776
You call 
your mother a bitch.

267
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,278
That's my mother.

268
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:52,684
Alright. Starting over. 
Commercial break. La-di-da.

269
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,055
Where you wanna go? 
You wanna go to the park?

270
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,658
I don't like the park.

271
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,293
Then where?

272
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,428
You don't wanna 
see the fireworks.

273
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,397
Don't wanna go to the park.

274
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,299
Where you wanna go?

275
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,434
Don't wanna go nowhere.

276
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,603
I hate this town.

277
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,574
You told me on the computer 
the first night we met.

278
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:19,978
You said you had a friend 
you used to fool around with?

279
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,380
Yeah.

280
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,781
What was his name?

281
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,816
Todd.

282
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,552
Todd... That's right.

283
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,423
How come you don't 
speak to him anymore?

284
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,992
I just never really...

285
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,330
Once middle school came, 
he started acting weird.

286
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,566
Like a faggot?

287
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,734
Yeah, I guess.

288
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,540
Wearing flamboyant clothes?

289
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:49,875
Yeah...

290
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,644
And he started 
hanging out with all girls.

291
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,550
I wonder what 
he's doing tonight?

292
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,019
He's probably out. 
I know he goes to Chez.

293
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,623
- The bar Chez? 
- Yeah.

294
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,559
And they don't beat the shit 
out of him at school?

295
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:09,828
I guess people 
just leave him alone

296
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,997
because he's too weird 
or something.

297
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,868
Do people leave you alone?

298
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,804
Yeah, I guess.

299
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,640
I don't really talk a lot.

300
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,713
- Wanna go and see him? 
- No!

301
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:30,048
C'mon! 
We're only five minutes away.

302
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:31,616
I don't want to do that.

303
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,852
So you're not scared 
to meet some guy

304
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,154
you just met 
on the computer.

305
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,989
But you're scared 
to see someone--

306
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,925
- I don't want to know him. 
- Why not?

307
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,526
I don't know.

308
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:46,431
When we were 13, 
he was still pretty normal.

309
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,768
I know 'cause, 
he used to be on the swim team

310
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,069
and I used to dive.

311
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:54,539
I wasn't really talking 
to him or anything.

312
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,908
We had this swim coach,

313
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,177
and he was 
the diving coach too...

314
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,814
I had a funny feeling 
about him.

315
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,751
- Fag? 
- Yeah.

316
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:06,985
[chuckling]

317
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,954
What?

318
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,222
No, go on.

319
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,824
I'm anticipating the story.

320
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,760
Go on.

321
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:25,103
One night my mom was really 
late to pick me up.

322
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:32,177
And I saw Ted give Todd 
a ride home in his car...

323
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,113
which coaches, I mean,

324
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:37,549
you're not supposed to.

325
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:44,990
It was making me really mad, 
like I didn't know what to do.

326
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,225
I decided to give him a call -

327
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:51,696
to see, like... 
Just to see if he was home.

328
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,167
And I don't 
know why or anything.

329
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,537
I just said, like meanly, like,

330
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,506
'You're gay, aren't you?'

331
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,908
And then I hung up.

332
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:05,977
You hung up?

333
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,746
I hung up...

334
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,651
And I never spoke 
to him again after that.

335
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:16,054
I don't know if he knew 
if it was me or not,

336
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,089
but I just never...

337
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,992
I hated him after that.

338
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,194
You hated him?

339
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,496
Yeah. I just... 
I don't know.

340
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,706
Okay, June...

341
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:36,942
Where do you 
want to go right now?

342
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,578
Where do I want to go?

343
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,079
Okay, just tell me.

344
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,648
C'mon. Just tell me.

345
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:44,816
This is your night.

346
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,552
You're the young man, 
I'm the old man.

347
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,087
Tell me.

348
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,240
Coach Donavan said 
he thinks I'm like the best

349
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:11,810
Division II player 
he's ever seen.

350
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,645
Says he wants to 
give me a transfer

351
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:14,846
to a Division I school.

352
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,049
But that my grades 
are a little bit bad.

353
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:22,087
Plus, my record.

354
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,289
But apparently some schools 
are still interested,

355
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:27,225
so, you know, that's cool.

356
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:29,127
Which schools?

357
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,162
A couple. 
Watch this...

358
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,232
Oh, God!

359
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,800
Showoff.

360
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,138
So tell me...

361
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,107
Why'd you change your mind?

362
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:43,909
Felt like it.

363
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,044
Yeah?

364
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:49,748
I know I'm a white boy and you 
ain't into that kind of thing.

365
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,284
Half white, half spic. 
Don't sell yourself short.

366
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,818
Oh!

367
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,887
You're a little bit racist!

368
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,691
I mean, apparently you ain't 
into either one.

369
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,226
I never said that.

370
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,163
That I'm not into white boys. 
I never said that.

371
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:06,998
So then tell me...

372
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,602
You think I'm cute?

373
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,370
You think I'm handsome?

374
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:15,307
You think I'm pretty?

375
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,010
You can tell me. C'mon!

376
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:21,880
I don't like your questions.

377
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,883
What if I told you...

378
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,286
I think you're pretty?

379
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,057
I'd accept the complement.

380
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,963
What if I told you

381
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,765
I think that you 
are beautiful?

382
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,869
I think that you 
are beautiful chocolate.

383
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,305
You just ruined it 
by calling me chocolate.

384
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:52,210
What if I told you 
I think you're beautiful -

385
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:54,379
no chocolate?

386
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,715
Even though it's delicious.

387
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:00,285
I know you're intentions. 
You know that, right?

388
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,320
You know you ain't fooling me.

389
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:04,022
I don't got no intentions.

390
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,306
I mean, fuck that. 
I'm here with you right.

391
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,907
You were saying.

392
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,743
I wasn't saying anything.

393
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,279
You were saying that...

394
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,849
you think that 
I'm cute sometimes.

395
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:33,718
Yeah?

396
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,054
Yeah.

397
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,690
Alright, so then when?

398
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,059
When do you think I'm cute?

399
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,333
When you're smiling 
like a little boy.

400
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,434
You think I'm like 
a little boy?

401
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,303
Sometimes.

402
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,809
You don't get it...

403
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,744
It's hard to talk to you.

404
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,715
You think I'm stupid, 
don't you?

405
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:05,917
You do.

406
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,056
You think I'm like at home 
playing with Legos,

407
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,291
puttin' my finger 
up my nose and shit.

408
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:19,264
You think I'm not 
good enough for you.

409
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,368
That I can't understand 
your thoughts,

410
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,236
or whatever is going on 
in your head.

411
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,440
I got thoughts too.

412
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,743
Watch.

413
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:35,914
Before the night is out...

414
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,749
you're gonna 
tell me your thoughts.

415
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:46,057
I wish you did want 
to see the fireworks.

416
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,530
But you don't wanna do that.

417
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,536
That's okay, 
maybe we could stay here.

418
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:05,577
That's cool too. We can see 
the sky get all bright...

419
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:09,848
Watch the clouds light up... 
That's cool too.

420
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,929
I used to love coming here.

421
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,564
Everybody loved me.

422
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,068
Everybody knew who I was. 
I played basketball.

423
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,836
I was the leading scorer.

424
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,973
They wrote about me 
in the newspaper.

like to do was confession.

00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:45,116
You believe in God?

00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,023
I believe in God.

429
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:57,328
I don't got no reason not too. 
I don't know why I wouldn't.

430
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:00,365
My dad didn't believe in God, 
look at that bitch.

431
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,234
He's fat and toothless.

432
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,136
Don't talk about 
your dad that way.

The Bible is

It's inspired and enraged 
so many people.

I volunteer 
a couple days a week.

487
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,835
At the University.

488
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,838
I see a lot of kids 
in trouble these days.

489
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,340
Sad kids.

490
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,243
I didn't seem that sad 
when I was growing up.

491
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:10,214
We learned to keep a lot inside. 
We didn't expect too much.

492
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,352
Maybe that was...

493
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,320
a good thing, you know.

494
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:23,127
The other day 
I was with this man.

495
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,132
And he was very poor.

496
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,768
He was on food stamps 
and welfare.

497
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,570
And he's white.

498
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,308
He'd just had it.

499
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,213
He's a little older than me.

500
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,315
Graduated from high school.

501
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,284
But he hadn't gone to college.

502
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:47,718
And he had a family.

503
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,124
Can you hear me in there?!

504
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:55,660
Yeah!!

505
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,629
Well, he had a family.

506
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:01,532
And he lost his family. 
He left them.

507
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,135
And he married another woman.

508
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,537
And then he left her too.

509
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,906
And then he stopped 
trying to be married.

510
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:14,212
He wanted to... 
be on his own.

511
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,414
He wanted to do 
what he wanted to do.

512
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,483
The work that I do -

513
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,952
it's a counseling center. 
It's a health center.

514
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,653
I see a lot of kids.

515
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:24,589
It's a surprise to see

516
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,557
an older person - 
especially a man.

517
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:29,660
And he's there 
getting his blood tested.

518
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:33,631
And as we were talking...

519
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,536
I started to realize.

520
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:43,441
I started... 
to remember this man.

521
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:48,412
Well, I realized this...

522
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:52,383
was the first man I slept with.

523
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:57,221
I remember because he had a scar 
on the bottom of his left ear.

524
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:01,225
It looked like a snake, 
I remember thinking.

525
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:10,334
It was the 80s.

526
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:16,407
And I was going through 
a rough point at that time.

527
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,649
The good thing 
about this disease

528
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,885
is that it makes most people

529
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:31,789
start thinking about sex 
instead of just having it.

530
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:33,391
You know what I'm saying?

531
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:42,466
Many people start thinking 
about the other person

532
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,635
and what they may have 
inside of them.

533
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,777
I think....

534
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,448
this disease is the best thing 
that ever happened

535
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,318
to gay men because...

536
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,653
in a certain sense 
it has made us human.

537
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,026
But I could go on forever 
about this.

538
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,029
I'm getting away from the story.

539
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,664
Are you interested?!

540
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,700
I'll stop. I'll stop talking.

541
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,402
Can you hear me?!

542
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:22,273
No...uh... Keep going.

543
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:29,513
I didn't bring it up to him, 
of course.

544
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,351
I look different.

545
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,723
He wouldn't recognize me.

546
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,975
I started thinking about...

547
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:02,346
the myths of first love, 
first sex.

548
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,016
How for gay boys of today...

549
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:08,586
their first AIDS test 
is the equivalent of

550
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,989
a straight boy 
losing his virginity.

551
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,064
What's wrong?

552
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,732
Nothing.

553
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,635
You're all dressed. 
Did you shower?

554
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,109
Are you okay?

555
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,778
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

556
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,479
I just...

557
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,856
This is a mistake, isn't it?

558
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,758
- No! 
- Let's not do this.

559
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,160
You don't have to do this.

560
00:38:49,193 --> 00:38:50,895
I just... 
I don't know.

561
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:51,929
I'll take you home.

562
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:54,765
- I don't want to go home. 
- What do you want?

563
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:03,040
I'm sorry.

564
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,052
I'm horny.

565
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:18,789
You're what?

566
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:27,465
I'm horny.

567
00:40:09,106 --> 00:40:10,841
What do you want, June?

568
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,457
June, June, June...

569
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,197
You are beautiful.

570
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:42,039
You are beautiful.

571
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,775
You beautiful boy.

572
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,555
Nah, ma. We're good.

573
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,525
See, I told you 
your place was better.

574
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,769
It's a little...messy.

575

Entré. Entré, madam.

576
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,641
You can sit down if you like.

577
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,618
You saw what 
I was talking about, right?

578
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,721
The neighborhood, it's mixed.

579
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,056
What do you mean?

580
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:36,627
That I grew up in. 
We have black people and shit.

581
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,568
You know what's funny, though?

582
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,804
I talk like I'm black, right?

583
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,874
And you talk like 
you're a white girl.

584
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:52,910
I do not talk like a white girl.

585
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,246
What you mean, you don't? 
Your mama white?

586
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,548
No! She's black!

587
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,917
Damn, girl. 
Why you say it like that?

588
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:00,985
Like what?

589
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,288
Like you angry or some shit.

590
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,958
You got a nice room.

591
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,729
It's small, but it's cozy,

592
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,797
Little Miss Change-the-Subject.

593
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,099
All these posters.

594
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,802
I wish I was black.

595
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,939
I do...

596
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,108
Sometimes I just 
wish I was black.

597
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:31,582
What?

598
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:49,546
You alright?

599
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,185
Yeah.

600
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:00,324
I'm ready to go home.

601
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,067
How come you ain't talkin'?

602
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:13,971
You're not talkin' either.

603
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,375
You could have taken 
the left-over barbecue.

604
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:19,576
It was good.

605
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:22,079
I don't eat meat.

606
00:46:29,486 --> 00:46:31,989
Maybe tomorrow you want 
to go see a movie?

607
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:33,824
I have to work.

You haven't said anything.

612
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:48,305
Hmm?

613
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,408
You haven't said 
anything about it.

614
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,587
Was it okay?

615
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,657
No, um...

Yeah... it was. I just...

I think it makes her sad.

Why is that?

624
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:38,889
She doesn't want to be reminded.

625
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,026
Of what?
