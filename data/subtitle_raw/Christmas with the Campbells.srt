1
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:29,333
Okay. This is going to be
the perfect Christmas card.

2
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:31,553
Grab your belly and look up.

3
00:00:31,596 --> 00:00:33,598
Love her!

4
00:00:33,642 --> 00:00:35,557
Amazing.
Perfect.

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,646
Aww.

6
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:39,996
All right. Let's get you guys
a little bit closer together.

7
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,303
Just a little bit.
Big smile.

8
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:43,913
Great.

9
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:46,829
Can you scoot a little bit
next to your brother?

10
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:49,658
Perfect!

11
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:51,312
Mom's so happy.

12
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,577
We're gonna get
so many fucking presents.

13
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:01,452
I like seeing everybody
in their Christmas clothes,

14
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:03,672
and I like seeing people happy.

15
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:06,805
And besides,
photography is my passion.

16
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:09,591
Passion? Really more
of a hobby, isn't it?

17
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:12,246
You're never gonna make any
money doing photography, Jesse.

18
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:13,986
You should be spending
all your extra free time

19
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,249
advancing your career.

20
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:17,033
I'm pretty content
being a buyer.

21
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,861
I mean, I'm grateful
that I have a job.

22
00:01:18,904 --> 00:01:23,126
And no, it's not my calling,
but it gives me a chance

23
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,998
to put my time and energy
into other things.

24
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:28,131
Where do you see yourself
in 10 years?

25
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:31,178
In 10 years,
I see myself with you...

26
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:33,745
In a house, two kids, and a dog.

27
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:40,229
Oh, it's your mom.
Okay.

28
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:42,841
Hey, Mrs. C.
How's it looking out there?

29
00:01:42,884 --> 00:01:44,973
Are we getting treated
to a white Christmas?

30
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:48,325
Oh!
Ketchum never lets us down.

31
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:50,501
- Are you there too, Shawn?
- I'm here, Mom. Yeah.

32
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:51,937
We were just in the middle
of eating.

33
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:54,070
I made him
an amazing tikka masala.

34
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,158
- You would love it.
- Make me a recipe card.

35
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:57,769
Already made you one.

36
00:01:57,813 --> 00:02:01,817
I am thinking of making
a cornbread-and-apricot stuffing

37
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,948
this year.

38
00:02:02,992 --> 00:02:04,950
Ooh.
Sweet andsavory.

39
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:06,865
Of course, I'll still make
a traditional stuffing

40
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:07,997
on the side.

41
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,347
Hey, Mom, can I call you after?

42
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:13,176
Yeah. Sounds like someone's
had a long day.

43
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,612
Yeah. But I'm sorry.

44
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,353
And, Jesse,
what do you want for Christmas?

45
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:19,400
I already have
what I want... true love.

46
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:21,053
Okay. We have to go now, Mom.

47
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:23,578
I'll call you soon, I promise.
Sorry.

48
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:25,971
Why don't you just keep making
carbs for the whole family

49
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:27,625
until we're allbattling
weight issues?

50
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:29,975
Oh, by the way,
I went to three different shops

51
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,629
to try to find an authentic
Dutch gnome

52
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:33,978
for your mom for Christmas,
and you know what? No luck.

53
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:36,547
I know we always go antiquing
when I'm there,

54
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:38,288
and I'm sure she'll find one
that she likes

55
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:39,507
and I could get it for her,
but it's always really nice

56
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,335
- to find it yourself.
- Mm-hmm.

57
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:44,425
Are you as excited to go to
Ketchum for Christmas as I am?

58
00:02:44,468 --> 00:02:47,210
I love it there.
So beautiful.

59
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:52,911
Jesse, I have a job interview
in New York.

60
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:53,912
- Oh!
- Yeah.

61
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:55,566
I just found out about it today.

62
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,916
It's actually it's one
of the biggest accounting firms,

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,354
and so there's a lot of room
to grow,

64
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:03,095
make a shit ton more money.

65
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:05,837
- That's really great.
- Yeah.

66
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:08,013
It's the week before Christmas,
Jesse.

67
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:10,755
Oh, maybe I'll fly ahead
to your parents' house,

68
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,670
and then you can just fly out
from New York.

69
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:14,237
What I'm saying is
I don't think Ketchum

70
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:16,326
is happening this Christmas.

71
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:21,201
'Cause I got to be available
for a second interview.

72
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:24,900
Well, then how about I just
come with you to New York?

73
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:27,250
Actually, I don't think
my ticket is transferable.

74
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:29,252
Jesse, um...

75
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:34,605
I think I'm holding you back.

76
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:37,347
Holding me back from... what?

77
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:40,394
Don't make this any harder
than it has to be, you know?

78
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:43,397
We... We had a really great run.

79
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,442
Are you breaking up with me?

80
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:48,837
I don't see our paths leading
in the same direction.

81
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,015
I have a lot of plans that don't
involve homes and kids and dogs.

82
00:03:53,058 --> 00:03:55,322
Well, we just had sex
this morning.

83
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:59,108
Yeah. I know, and it was really
just out of sight.

84
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:00,631
Just...

85
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:02,285
And I love that about you,
you know?

86
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:05,419
You're down to clown,
and you're sexy as fuck.

87
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:08,291
I mean, you keep that pussy...
♪ So fresh

88
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:11,207
It's really, like,
just incredible how you do it.

89
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,427
And look, I'd be happy
to keep servicing your needs

90
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,993
if it won't complicate things.

91
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:17,648
- Shawn, don't... don't do this.
- Hey, look.

92
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:20,260
Baby, we did things right,
you know?

93
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,043
We kept the fights clean
and the sex dirty.

94
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:25,090
We respected each other.
We laughed. Remember?

95
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:27,484
And neither one of us were
unfaithful as far as you know.

96
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:30,661
I think we chalk this up
as a big win.

97
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:34,099
But now... it's time
for us both to grow.

98
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:37,102
And I-I meant what I said
about your needs.

99
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:39,191
I'll... I'll take care of them.
You know I will.

100
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:42,238
If you need someone to step in
and pinch-hit,

101
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,935
day or night,
if I'm not doing anything else.

102
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:47,156
Just shoot me a text or page me.
Whatever.

103
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,116
All right.

104
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:57,732
Be well.

105
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:09,918
♪ Silver bells

106
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:13,965
♪ Silver bells

107
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,885
♪ It's Christmastime
in the city ♪

108
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:25,020
♪ Ring-a-ling

109
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,676
♪ Hear them ring

110
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:35,247
Hey, Mrs. C.

111
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,162
I just spoke to Shawn.

112
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:39,426
I don't even have words.

113
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:43,255
I mean, breaking up with you
right before Christmas.

114
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:48,130
Yeah. Um, I'm...
I'm still in shock myself.

115
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:52,787
Well, if Shawn doesn't want to
come home, that's fine.

116
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,138
But we still want you to come,
Jesse.

117
00:05:56,181 --> 00:05:58,532
You still want me to come
to your place for Christmas?

118
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:00,011
Of course!

119
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:02,231
You're like family to us.

120
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:05,713
Well, t-that is very,
very nice of you,

121
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:08,629
and I appreciate the offer,
but...

122
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:10,544
I don't think that's
a very good idea.

123
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:12,720
It's the best idea.

124
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:14,330
You don't have anywhere else
to go,

125
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,419
and I'm not going to have you
sitting by yourself

126
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:17,507
on Christmas.

127
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:20,467
We want you here,
and we love you.

128
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:36,004
Hi!

129
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:37,832
Mr. and Mrs. C!

130
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,487
You didn't have to pick me up.
I would have taken a cab!

131
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,618
Oh, please.

132
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:43,968
When have we not
ever picked you up?

133
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:45,753
And it's no different this time.

134
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:48,364
You're family, Jesse.

135
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,499
You are skin and bones.
Have you been eating food?

136
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:54,326
I-I have.

137
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,286
I have a brownie in my purse.

138
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:58,808
Here you go.

139
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:01,595
And we're stopping
at the grocery on the way back.

140
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:03,466
I am going to make you
all your favorites.

141
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,469
Be careful of this one.
She can bake all right.

142
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:08,993
But you will swell up
like a tick.

143
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:14,346
Oh! Liz!

144
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,871
I was going to talk
to that husband of yours

145
00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:18,829
about going over
some of my taxes.

146
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:21,179
Is he working over the holidays?

147
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:23,660
- At least until Christmas Eve.
- Oh, great.

148
00:07:23,704 --> 00:07:25,749
Oh, it's Jesse, isn't it?

149
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:28,186
- Yeah.
- Are you in town for Christmas?

150
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,798
It wouldn't be the holidays
without Jesse.

151
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,408
And what of that son of yours?

152
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,063
Is he too busy to come in
and say hello?

153
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:39,328
Actually, Shawn is going to be
in New York for Christmas

154
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,722
this year,
as you've probably heard.

155
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:44,246
So, are you two still together,

156
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:47,858
or did he do you dirty
like he did my Darlene?

157
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:51,034
- There's your ground round, Liz.
- Thank you, Stuart.

158
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,647
And I will be back
for my Christmas bird.

159
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,953
Great. Oh.
Extra gravy on the side?

160
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:58,173
Extra extra gravy, please.

161
00:07:58,216 --> 00:08:00,175
Bye-bye.

162
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:01,524
Give my best to Darlene.

163
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:03,308
Oh, I will.

164
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:06,964
Too bad Shawn's not here
to shove in hisregards.

165
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:11,012
Okay.

166
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:13,580
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

167
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:17,540
What a whore, showing up here
all by herself.

168
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:20,674
- Gosh, it's...
- Honestly, that is so desperate.

169
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,765
Robert? Dinner's ready.

170
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:26,418
Ah.

171
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:28,332
Whoa.

172
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:32,381
I thought we were gonna lay off
the carbs till Christmas.

173
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:34,164
It's a ploughman's.

174
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:37,342
Ploughman's is mostly bread.

175
00:08:37,385 --> 00:08:40,084
Eat or don't eat, Robert.

176
00:08:40,128 --> 00:08:41,825
So, how's work going?

177
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:43,131
Oh, you know what?

178
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:45,133
It's actually
a little bit better now.

179
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:46,961
I take a couple days
to work from home.

180
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:50,225
His secretary retired, and the
office has gotten awfully quiet.

181
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:52,401
He really should give it up.

182
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:54,142
Let's not be hasty.

183
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:56,187
What I should be giving up
is all this bread.

184
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:57,711
He's always wished

185
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:59,277
that Shawn would come back
and work with him.

186
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:01,236
But I think we understand

187
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,587
that Shawn has bigger dreams
outside of Ketchum, don't we?

188
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:05,893
Speaking of which,

189
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:07,808
how's the Petco thing going
for you?

190
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:09,331
Oh, it's going.

191
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:12,073
But, you know,
I'm always open to a new path.

192
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:14,597
Really?

193
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:16,643
Well, as one who has hit
the fork in the road

194
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:18,340
and had to make path decisions,

195
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:22,431
you will never know where
it leads until you take it.

196
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,304
Um, that feels fairly obvious.

197
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:29,090
Not exactly
groundbreaking counsel

198
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:31,788
but undeniably accurate.

199
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:38,969
Eat your ploughman's, Robert.

200
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,366
Bedtime snack.

201
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:47,151
Oh!
Thank you so much, Liz.

202
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:49,197
Jesse...

203
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,637
I know it must feel strange
to be here without Shawn.

204
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:58,641
And I maybe was selfish
to ask you to come.

205
00:09:58,685 --> 00:10:01,775
No.
It... It feels right to be here.

206
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:03,690
The first time you came,

207
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:06,997
you and Shawn had only been
together what, four weeks?

208
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,217
Three weeks, I think.

209
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,220
And even then, I knew you were
a perfect fit for this family.

210
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:16,093
I mean, who else would
appreciate gnomes like I do?

211
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:17,791
Exactly.

212
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:21,011
I just want to say that...

213
00:10:21,882 --> 00:10:26,103
...I know that Shawn can be
very active.

214
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:30,978
And... wild sexually.

215
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:35,243
And I want you to know...

216
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:38,638
...that comes from my side
of the family.

217
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:43,468
And I really just
wanted to apologize.

218
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:44,644
I'm sorry.

219
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:48,691
Thank you for sharing that
with me.

220
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:52,652
That... Um, I didn't know that,
but... that makes sense.

221
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:55,132
Okay.
Well, two or three cookies

222
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:56,917
and you'll have
a good night's sleep.

223
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,310
Jesse, I will see you
in the morning

224
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:01,748
for pancakes with Nutella.

225
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,185
- Mmm.
- Good night.

226
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:07,492
And I'm so glad you're here.

227
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:09,843
There's no place like gnome.

228
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,453
I knew you'd get that.

229
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:13,324
Okay.

230
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:14,674
And if you're still hungry,

231
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:17,067
there's some cheese cubes
in the fridge.

232
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:18,373
Great.

233
00:11:20,462 --> 00:11:23,073
Oh, then tomorrow
is Robert's morning,

234
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:26,163
so we won't be downstairs
till about 10:00.

235
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,950
Get it, girl.

236
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,654
- Robert.
- Hmm?

237
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,656
Where are you going?
It's your morning.

238
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,964
Uh, yeah. I got to get started
on these lights.

239
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:45,748
It's important
that we stay connected

240
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:47,881
during this busy holiday season.

241
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:49,883
Well, you're right, honey.

242
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:53,538
And normally I would love to,
but I've got so much to do.

243
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:58,935
I want you to drop those lights
and put on a good mind-set...

244
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,937
...and pull out your dick.

245
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,203
It's your morning, Robert.

246
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:18,999
This one is a recipe that
Shawn's cross-eyed grandmother

247
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:20,827
used to make.

248
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,525
Aww. Crème fraîche.
Mmm.

249
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:25,440
That was the secret ingredient.

250
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:26,615
Mm.

251
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:28,791
There's probably
some misspellings.

252
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:33,665
Well, unfortunately, I have to
go cut hair and do therapy.

253
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:35,145
But don't worry about the stew.

254
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,104
It can just stay on low
until I get back.

255
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:38,932
How about I decorate the tree
while you're at work?

256
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:41,848
I would love that,
but Robert's not back until late

257
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:45,808
to go up in the attic
and haul out the decorations.

258
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:50,421
I would do it myself,
but... I don't like to.

259
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:51,988
That's okay.
I know where to find them.

260
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:54,730
Okay. Have fun.
Be careful.

261
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,603
And if you get bored later,
come on in for a blow-dry.

262
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:01,041
On me.

263
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:02,825
Thanks, Mrs. C.

264
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:10,137
Hello?

265
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:13,618
Oh!
Ooh!

266
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:15,751
There's a dog.
Um, hello.

267
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,493
Uh, come here, boy...
I mean girl. Or whatever.

268
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:20,712
Uh, do you want a cookie?
Come here.

269
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:22,976
Come on.
Get away from them.

270
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:25,805
Come here. Come here, dog.
Come here, puppy.

271
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,415
He prefers dinner
before dessert.

272
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,504
Oh, my... Hello.

273
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:31,898
Um, is this your dog?

274
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:34,378
And best friend.
Rescued him when he was a pup.

275
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:36,728
I named him after
my second favorite explorer.

276
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:38,382
Hey, Polo.
Come on!

277
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:40,123
Leave that, Polo.

278
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:42,430
I can't be mad at him.
He's too gorgeous.

279
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:45,781
Name's David.
I'm kin to the Campbells.

280
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,565
Fall under the title of nephew.

281
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,959
Oh, you're Liz's sister's son.

282
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:51,178
Glad to meet you.

283
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,919
Well, nice to meet you.

284
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:54,703
I'm Jesse.
I'm Shawn's gir...

285
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:59,403
Um... I was dating Shawn, and
then now... We're on a pause.

286
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:00,752
It's complicated.
I don't want to get into it.

287
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:02,537
But I'm friends
with the Campbells.

288
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,886
So you're here by yourself?

289
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,801
Well, the Campbells
invited me here,

290
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,585
and I also had already
bought them presents,

291
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:09,544
and I had already bought
my plane ticket and I...

292
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:11,589
No need to hang your laundry
on the line here in front of me.

293
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:12,939
That's yourDairy Queen.

294
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:15,724
- I'm just glad to meet you.
- Me too.

295
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:17,465
It's my dog.
I'll clean up after him.

296
00:14:17,508 --> 00:14:19,946
Well, I'll call Liz and Robert
and tell him that you're here.

297
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:22,992
Actually, you know, uh,
they don't know I'm coming.

298
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:25,560
Yeah. I was just gonna surprise
him on my way to Mount Hood.

299
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:28,606
Well, looks like I need to
head into town,

300
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,218
find a replacement
for this ornament.

301
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,523
And I suppose I'll have to guess

302
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:33,960
at the ingredients
for that stew.

303
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:36,876
Oh, I know the recipe.
I can help you with that.

304
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,574
Well, if it doesn't dirty your
dress, yeah, I'd appreciate it.

305
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,882
No problem.

306
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:49,105
W... Sh... Polo!

307
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:50,890
Polo!

308
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,979
Aw, Polo, go on!

309
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:54,371
Come on. Come on.
Get back in the house.

310
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:56,678
Sorry. It's kind of...
Kind of his spot.

311
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:58,419
Come on, bud.
I'm asking nice.

312
00:14:58,462 --> 00:14:59,942
Come on!

313
00:14:59,986 --> 00:15:01,422
Oh, good boy.

314
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:03,903
That's his spot usually.

315
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,774
I'll be back soon!

316
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:12,912
All right. So we have carrots,
potatoes, celery, peas.

317
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:14,870
Oh.
We forgot the ground round.

318
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,134
Oh. We'd better retie
that string around her finger.

319
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:20,267
- Got to have the meat.
- Yeah.

320
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,617
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

321
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:52,821
Sorry I took so long.

322
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:54,518
All right.
Decoration time.

323
00:15:54,562 --> 00:15:56,259
Let's go replace that ornament.

324
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:58,392
I think the Christmas market
is right around the corner.

325
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:00,176
Oh.
Well, let's do it.

326
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,004
Besides, what's more fun
than shopping

327
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:04,137
and talking about
absolutely nothing?

328
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:07,009
So, Colorado's home?

329
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,141
Yep.
Mount Wilson.

330
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:10,143
We got sun and snow.

331
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,492
Best skiing around.

332
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:13,015
You must ski all year.

333
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:16,366
No. Not once.
I'm more of a facilitator.

334
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,803
I, uh, operate
a small travel agency.

335
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:20,153
That's what brings me joy

336
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:22,242
is making other people's dreams
come true.

337
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:23,983
That's amazing.

338
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:27,073
What about you?
What appeals your potato?

339
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:31,947
Um, well, I guess I-I really...
I like photography.

340
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,644
Very nice.
Really?

341
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:35,907
What kind of...
What kind of photos you take?

342
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:40,173
Really, any different thing
that catches my eye day to day.

343
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:42,740
Um, I take
some family portraits,

344
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:44,786
but that's really more
of a hobby.

345
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:46,614
There's not much
of a career path there.

346
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:48,050
Well, who cares?

347
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:49,617
It tickles your soul, right?

348
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,098
That puts you
way ahead of the game.

349
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:54,187
Hm.

350
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,624
So, is the rest of your family
joining us for the holiday?

351
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:59,409
No. My, um, my pop passed
when I was 8.

352
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:01,107
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

353
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,805
And my stepdad, Skip, he, um,

354
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:06,199
he takes my ma on a trip
every Christmas.

355
00:17:06,242 --> 00:17:08,069
And then this year,
they're going to Alaska.

356
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:09,202
- Oh. Very nice.
- Yeah.

357
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:10,986
Should be nice for them.

358
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,031
When I was 9, he, uh,
sat me down and he said,

359
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:15,034
"I'm never gonna try
to be your father,

360
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,819
but I sure do love being
romantic with your mother.

361
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:20,213
So I'm gonna take her on a trip
every holiday

362
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:21,866
so that I can get her alone

363
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,955
and do stuff to her
without any interruptions."

364
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,348
I said, "What kind of things?"

365
00:17:26,393 --> 00:17:28,830
He said, "Rub on her
and have her tug me

366
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:31,093
and incorporate
children's costumes,

367
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:32,660
but in a more adult way.

368
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:34,270
It may sound selfish, but, uh,

369
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:36,794
that's what keeps
the engine running," he said.

370
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:41,103
Anyway, uh, of course,
not too keen on it,

371
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:43,801
but you also got to let people
live the lives

372
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:45,064
they want to live, right?

373
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,852
Wow. That sounds awful...
and oddly specific.

374
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:53,159
But I also know what it's like
to have your family

375
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:55,335
not invite you for the holidays.

376
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,382
- Here we are.
- Shall we?

377
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:02,255
Oh, they got some talented hands
in China.

378
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:05,127
I always think of the Valley as
being so great for outdoor activities,

379
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:07,999
but I forget what a killer
art scene they got here, too.

380
00:18:08,043 --> 00:18:09,262
It's funny...
I've actually never done

381
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:11,133
any outdoor activities here.

382
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:16,138
Really? Shawn never took you,
uh, skiing or snowshoeing?

383
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:19,489
Wow. Well, how many times
you been to Ketchum?

384
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:24,407
Let's see. Um, every Christmas,
Thanksgiving, Easter,

385
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:26,627
Memorial Day,
St. Patrick's Day,

386
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:30,413
Mr. and Mrs. C's birthdays,
their anniversaries,

387
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:32,850
Labor Day,
and, of course, my birthday.

388
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:35,679
Wow. Your mouth is just saying
the whole calendar.

389
00:18:35,723 --> 00:18:37,681
You know, whenever
I'd come here to visit,

390
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:39,161
I-I just couldn't get enough
of the mountains.

391
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:42,164
Man, the sights, the smells,
the snow.

392
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,471
It always just felt right,
you know?

393
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:47,213
Come to think of it, I never
could get Shawn to come outside.

394
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:50,564
He was always wanting to be
inside, playing Monopoly.

395
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:52,522
And I'm not knocking Monopoly.

396
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:54,307
I'd just personally
rather be outside living

397
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,136
than inside,
counting fake money, you know?

398
00:18:58,354 --> 00:18:59,616
I totally agree.

399
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,227
Well, you have time
for one more stop?

400
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,532
- Sure.
- All right.

401
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:05,231
- Thanks, Gertrude.
- You're welcome. Bye-bye.

402
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:09,844
Okay, so I'm having sex.
It's totally not connected.

403
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:13,064
And I look up and I see
this man, a beautiful man,

404
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:16,851
gyrating on top of me,
and I realize, Lloyd,

405
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:19,201
he doesn't even know
that my favorite band is Exposé.

406
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:21,812
- Oh.
- Yeah.

407
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:24,250
I would rather not be
in a relationship

408
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:26,861
than be in one
that I don't believe in.

409
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:30,256
Well, honey,
I say in the long run,

410
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,215
the only thing that matters
is good hygiene

411
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:35,217
and a man who won't
knock on the door

412
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:37,698
when you're drinking wine
in the tub.

413
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:39,395
Guess who!

414
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:41,963
- Oh!
- Oh!

415
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:44,400
Christmas came early this year.

416
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:47,316
Oh!
There are them smells.

417
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,535
Oh, you!

418
00:19:48,578 --> 00:19:50,450
And I see you met Jesse.

419
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:51,668
Oh, yeah.

420
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:53,148
Hi, David.

421
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,280
Becky.

422
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:56,238
I see you brought those lips.

423
00:19:56,282 --> 00:19:58,632
Oh.
These old flappers?

424
00:19:58,675 --> 00:19:59,676
I had to.

425
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,243
Oh, it's been a few years.

426
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:03,071
You look... You look great.

427
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:05,465
- You too.
- Let me hug your neck.

428
00:20:05,508 --> 00:20:06,901
I'll be delicate there.
Hey.

429
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:09,120
So you're staying for Christmas?

430
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:10,861
Well, if Aunt Lizzie has room
at the table.

431
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:13,168
- I don't want to assume.
- I heard Shawn's not coming in,

432
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,344
so there's room for you.

433
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:19,261
Uh, Francesca at...
At the hobby shop told me that.

434
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:21,045
Well, I'm delighted you're here.

435
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:23,396
And there's always room
at the table for you.

436
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:25,702
Aunt Liz, I appreciate you
so much.

437
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:27,269
God, if you were
two years younger.

438
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:28,923
We'd have to try
notto get pregnant.

439
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:33,667
But God bless, Liz.
I appreciate the invitation.

440
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,277
Thank you so much.

441
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:37,192
- It's good to see you, Becky.
- Good to see you.

442
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,281
We got some meat to stew.
We'd better head out.

443
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:41,152
Uh, I'll explain
when you get home.

444
00:20:41,196 --> 00:20:43,329
It's looking good.
All right.

445
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:45,983
- Bye, sweetie.
- Salvador, how are you?

446
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:47,289
Hey, listen.

447
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,943
News travels faster
in small towns

448
00:20:48,986 --> 00:20:50,814
than fleas do in a dog pound.

449
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:52,425
By this time tomorrow,
everyone in town

450
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:54,165
is gonna know that I'm here
and Shawn's not.

451
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:57,256
And then they'll just move on
to something new, you know?

452
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,431
- Thanks.
- Sure.

453
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:00,737
- Oh. Please. I got it.
- Thanks.

454
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:03,610
Thank you for helping me
with this.

455
00:21:03,653 --> 00:21:06,613
Oh, it is my pleasure.

456
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:09,050
This is fun.
I-I live for this.

457
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:12,445
Jesse, shoot me
if I'm trespassing here,

458
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:15,404
but, um, you know,
I've kept one foot in the door

459
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,058
of a relationship that's ended,

460
00:21:17,101 --> 00:21:21,410
and it just kind of prolongs
everything, you know?

461
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:23,282
That's not what I'm doing.

462
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,936
I have a great time
with the Campbells.

463
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,939
And then the last time
that we were here,

464
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:31,072
Mrs. C took me antiquing,

465
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:33,727
and, boy, does she know
how to haggle.

466
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,946
I mean, I love antiquing,
but she just takes it

467
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,513
- to another level.
- Yeah.

468
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:40,081
Oh, and on Thanksgiving,
it was so funny.

469
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:42,431
Mr. C tried to deep-fry
the turkey,

470
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,477
but it ended up looking like
Peking duck.

471
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,001
So then we ended up
having to order Chinese food.

472
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:48,481
And then everybody had to make
their own fortunes,

473
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:49,656
and we all drew one.

474
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,440
It was so much fun.

475
00:21:51,484 --> 00:21:53,660
It's pretty obvious you and the
Campbells have a blast together.

476
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:55,531
Oh, yeah.
We have a great time.

477
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,229
So what about you?

478
00:21:58,273 --> 00:21:59,796
What happened
with that relationship

479
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,450
where you stayed too long?

480
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:03,322
It started with me moving
to Bend, Oregon,

481
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,933
taking a lower-paying job
to be with her,

482
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:10,677
and ended with her fornicating
with my tae kwon do instructor.

483
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,200
Oh, my God.

484
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:14,158
Don Alvarez.

485
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:15,682
It's terrible.

486
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,162
It was.

487
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:21,688
We had a security camera
on the front doorbell,

488
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:23,864
and so I... I saw everything.

489
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:25,256
I'm so sorry.

490
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,823
Of course,
I don't honor what he did,

491
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:28,869
but, um, I know
he was gentle with her.

492
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,699
It actually turned out
to be a blessing.

493
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:34,657
You know,
it just made me realize

494
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:37,834
that no matter how joyful
something starts,

495
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:39,358
it always ends with hurt.

496
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:43,971
I'm much happier now just
hanging around with Polo here.

497
00:22:44,972 --> 00:22:46,147
Oh, I got to say, Jesse,

498
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,932
that, uh, tree's looking
marvelous again.

499
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:50,281
Oh.
Well, thank you.

500
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:51,718
I can't take
all the credit, though.

501
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:53,676
- David helped a little.
- A little?

502
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,462
You know, David,
maybe I could empower you

503
00:22:56,505 --> 00:22:59,595
to help me configure the lights
for our show.

504
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:02,903
Empower me? Is that a fancy way
of asking me to do it?

505
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:04,600
- Yes, please.
- No. Of course.

506
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:06,994
- I'd be happy to, Uncle Rob.
- Oh, thank you.

507
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:09,257
I didn't know y'all were still
doing that light show.

508
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,693
Oh!
Of course.

509
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:12,608
It's the highlight
of the Christmas party

510
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:14,393
and a Campbell tradition.

511
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:17,308
Speaking of traditions,
there's also the wishing tree.

512
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:19,223
Oh, yeah.
I heard about this.

513
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:21,835
It's, uh, supposed to be hidden
in the Valley somewhere, right?

514
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:23,576
- That's the one.
- And if you find it,

515
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:25,578
- you have to make a wish.
- Oh.

516
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:27,275
But it will only come true

517
00:23:27,318 --> 00:23:29,886
if you never tell anyone
where it is.

518
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,106
Have you two ever found it?

519
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:35,065
Maybe.

520
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:36,980
What about you and Shawn?

521
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:41,158
We... We looked a lot,
but no luck.

522
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:44,945
Well, maybe this will be
your lucky year.

523
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:58,611
Oh!

524
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:00,351
Hi!

525
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:02,484
Morning, Polo.
Oh!

526
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,530
What's going on?

527
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:07,271
Where are you taking me?

528
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:19,153
- It's nice and solid.
- Oh, God.

529
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:20,633
- You're all right.
- Okay.

530
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:21,982
Come on. You got it.

531
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:24,027
There you go!
All right!

532
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:25,594
- You got it. That's good.
- Whoa!

533
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:26,900
Yeah!

534
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:29,119
I'm glad I came.
I'm having so much fun.

535
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:31,992
A couple more steps, and we get
to the realpie crust.

536
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:34,603
Here we are.
Drink in that view.

537
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:35,822
Smooth goin' down.

538
00:24:35,865 --> 00:24:37,693
It's beautiful.

539
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,088
I haven't done something
this spontaneous in forever.

540
00:24:41,131 --> 00:24:43,656
Really? Well, what kind of stuff
did you and Shawn do?

541
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:45,353
I mean, other than Monopoly.

542
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:49,183
Well, we would, you know, do
stuff like work out, spin class.

543
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:53,230
Sometimes we would stay up late
and binge-watch a TV show.

544
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:54,928
Then he'd always complain
the next day

545
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:57,974
that he didn't get enough sleep
for his abs.

546
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:01,674
Oh, no. Man.
Come on.

547
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:03,676
You got to get my good side.

548
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:06,330
Yeah!

549
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:08,811
You're a natural!

550
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:11,205
My mom loved Christmas.

551
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:12,946
She died when I was 8.

552
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:17,341
And when she was gone, so was
the... the magic of the holiday.

553
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:19,605
And when my dad remarried,
he just wanted to throw away

554
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:22,956
all the memories,
and Christmas went with it.

555
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:25,262
I never told Shawn any of that.

556
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:26,829
I guess I was too afraid

557
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:29,092
that he would think
I came with too many issues.

558
00:25:29,136 --> 00:25:33,009
I mean, he thinks I talk a lot
and I overexplain things

559
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:35,098
and I go on long tangents
about nothing

560
00:25:35,142 --> 00:25:38,928
and I'm too sensitive,
that I cry too much,

561
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:42,149
They don't put away things
correctly.

562
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:45,456
But... everyone has their thing.

563
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,938
Oh, yeah. Everybody's got a
little dirt under their nails.

564
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:50,331
Yeah.

565
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:54,204
I find most people think
their dreams can't be reality,

566
00:25:54,248 --> 00:25:56,032
when more often than not,

567
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:58,469
all you need to do
is just reach out and grab them.

568
00:25:58,513 --> 00:25:59,775
They're right in front of you.

569
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:01,995
Okay.
Oh. Wait up.

570
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:04,650
- Are you coming?
- Okay. Hold on.

571
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:08,305
Cheers to grabbing... it.

572
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:10,743
All right.
To grabbing it.

573
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:19,795
Hey, bud.
What are you doing out here?

574
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,710
- Oh!
- Hey. You listen.

575
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:24,234
A little time apart, letting
loved ones be individuals,

576
00:26:24,278 --> 00:26:26,410
that makes getting together
all the more joyous.

577
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:27,760
I am so sorry.

578
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:30,066
I was just leaving,
and Polo just ran out.

579
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,764
- Oh. Hey, Beck.
- Hi.

580
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:33,635
I made you a pie.
I left it on the counter.

581
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,376
Well, that is mighty nice
of you.

582
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:37,726
Now, what flavor should my mouth
be expecting?

583
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,467
- Peach.
- Hm.

584
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:43,123
Then I spice things up a little
bit with some red ginseng,

585
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:48,302
ginkgo biloba, tribulus,
and just a pinch of vodka.

586
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:50,434
I've never heard of any
of those, but I trust you.

587
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:51,871
They're very
stimulating flavors.

588
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:53,699
Yeah.
That's stimulating my memory.

589
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:55,526
Phew.

590
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,920
Growing up, I never could get
enough of your sweets, Becky.

591
00:26:57,964 --> 00:26:59,705
Remember when we were kids?

592
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:02,533
You bought that box
of cookies for me,

593
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:06,842
and I... threw my whole
cookie jar at you.

594
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:07,974
Up in your three house.

595
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:09,453
In my tree house.

596
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:11,325
Man, if those tree-house
walls could talk.

597
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:13,414
Oof.

598
00:27:13,457 --> 00:27:15,764
Brings up a pretty good
memory file

599
00:27:15,808 --> 00:27:19,855
with smells and...
warmth and tastes and...

600
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:21,291
Consent?

601
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:23,511
Yeah.
Not on my end.

602
00:27:25,382 --> 00:27:27,733
Well, Jesse and I
should probably get inside

603
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:28,951
and help with the, uh...

604
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:30,823
Lights for the show.

605
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:32,389
Hi.

606
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:34,565
Have you been standing here
the whole time?

607
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:36,263
Hello.
Yes.

608
00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:39,745
Well, anyway, I want you
to stop by the bakery later...

609
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:41,442
It's on Main Street...

610
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:43,487
'cause I want to hear
what you thought of that pie.

611
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:44,532
Oh, I will indeed.

612
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:45,925
- Okay.
- Yeah. Thanks again.

613
00:27:45,968 --> 00:27:47,927
- Nice to see you.
- So good to see you.

614
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,843
What was that all about?

615
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:52,888
Oh, just childhood memories.

616
00:27:52,932 --> 00:27:54,411
I see.

617
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:56,587
She's nice.

618
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:58,938
That's why I never
ended up going.

619
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,419
How was skating?

620
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,030
- Oh.
- Oh, it was really great.

621
00:28:04,073 --> 00:28:05,858
It's been a while
since I've been on skates,

622
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:07,120
but I got my legs back.

623
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:08,904
Yeah.
Well, you'd never have known it.

624
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:12,168
Robert used to flood the yard
when Shawn was younger.

625
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:14,127
Did Becky ever come over
and skate?

626
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:17,260
- Only when David was in town.
- Mm-hmm.

627
00:28:17,304 --> 00:28:19,132
And then she would be here
day and night.

628
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:21,003
I'm surprised
she didn't get frostbite

629
00:28:21,047 --> 00:28:23,440
in that skating costume
she wore.

630
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:25,834
Oh, no. She did.
Yeah. Yeah.

631
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:27,880
She got it pretty bad
in some places.

632
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:30,752
So Becky and David were...

633
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:32,885
Friends.
Just friends.

634
00:28:32,928 --> 00:28:34,408
Mm.

635
00:28:34,451 --> 00:28:37,890
Saved by the bell. Mm.

636
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:39,848
Oh.
Shawn!

637
00:28:39,892 --> 00:28:43,939
Sweetie, it's so good
to hear from you.

638
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:46,986
Oh, you just got to New York.
Great.

639
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:48,596
Well, you should
probably get settled.

640
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:50,250
You've got a big day tomorrow.

641
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:52,252
Okay, Shawn.

642
00:28:52,295 --> 00:28:53,993
Dad and I miss you.

643
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:56,952
And best of luck
on the interview.

644
00:28:58,606 --> 00:28:59,607
How is he?

645
00:29:02,349 --> 00:29:05,874
Uh, Jesse, 'cause he's
been traveling,

646
00:29:05,918 --> 00:29:10,052
I haven't had a chance
to tell Shawn that you're here.

647
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:21,585
I hope Jesse's
having a good time.

648
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:24,066
Oh, relax.
She's fine.

649
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,372
They're having fun.

650
00:29:25,415 --> 00:29:26,721
Yeah.

651
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,856
Now... unwind
and take a sip of this.

652
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:35,730
It's lots of grape soda,
a healthy dose of cough syrup

653
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,601
topped off by hard candy.

654
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:41,040
It makes the perfect glass
of purple drank.

655
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:44,608
Liz, I really just want to get
some rest, go to sleep.

656
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:50,832
Right, and a serving of sizzurp
will make you feel really good

657
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:52,921
and will put you right to sleep.

658
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:54,923
Is this safe?

659
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:56,838
So let's just enjoy the moment,

660
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:59,580
have a nice glass of lean
together.

661
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:00,581
Cheers.

662
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:01,669
Yeah.

663
00:30:21,645 --> 00:30:22,864
Ah.

664
00:30:22,908 --> 00:30:25,998
Polo.

665
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:28,087
Couldn't sleep either?

666
00:30:33,962 --> 00:30:35,442
Want one?

667
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:44,146
Oh, wow.
Yeah.

668
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:47,933
Yeah, way more cough syrup
at the moment than grape soda.

669
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:49,630
It's very full bodied.

670
00:30:49,673 --> 00:30:50,674
Mm-hmm.

671
00:30:50,718 --> 00:30:52,851
I like that it's not oaky.

672
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,159
You know, the hard candy
is now bringing out the texture

673
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:58,508
of the grape soda.

674
00:30:58,552 --> 00:31:00,249
Plus, it gets you high.

675
00:31:00,293 --> 00:31:02,121
Mm.

676
00:31:06,212 --> 00:31:08,083
Polo?

677
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:10,825
Polo.

678
00:31:11,782 --> 00:31:14,394
Now, if I were to order this
in the future,

679
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:17,701
would it be purple drank
or sizzurp?

680
00:31:17,745 --> 00:31:19,703
Or lean.
What... What...

681
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:21,270
They'll know what you mean.

682
00:31:21,314 --> 00:31:23,620
I know.

683
00:31:23,664 --> 00:31:26,101
I know.
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

684
00:31:27,015 --> 00:31:29,757
I mean, Shawn doesn't even know
that I'm here.

685
00:31:31,106 --> 00:31:32,542
Maybe David is right.

686
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:37,199
Maybe I am keeping one foot
in the door.

687
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:40,724
Both feet, actually.

688
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:45,773
Sorry.
I don't want to scare you again.

689
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:50,038
Working on Aunt Lizzie's
shortbread cookies?

690
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:52,301
Mm-hmm.

691
00:31:52,345 --> 00:31:53,607
With candied cherries.

692
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,131
Oof. Man.
That's my poison.

693
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:58,655
She sends me a tin every year.

694
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:01,093
She sent me the recipe.

695
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:02,442
You're kidding me.

696
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:04,096
She told me that was top secret.

697
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:05,271
It is.

698
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,403
Well, you really are
like family.

699
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:13,192
You know, when my ex and I
broke up, uh,

700
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:14,889
at first I thought
I was missing her.

701
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,761
And then, um, I realized

702
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:20,416
I was just kind of missing
playing with her dog.

703
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:24,246
So I went to the shelter
and got Polo here.

704
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,856
- Right, buddy?
- Really?

705
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,771
- Yeah.
- Mm.

706
00:32:29,164 --> 00:32:32,515
Maybe you did come back
to keep one foot in the door.

707
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,779
Or maybe you just like
sharing recipes,

708
00:32:35,823 --> 00:32:37,129
hanging out with the family.

709
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:02,937
Robert, we have to get going.

710
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:08,290
Well, don't you
look nice for the dance.

711
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:10,989
Well, that's the pot calling
the kettle gorgeous.

712
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:14,079
Yeah, Polo picked it out.

713
00:33:14,122 --> 00:33:15,645
It's my finest threads.

714
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:17,821
That Wrangler butt of yours
is driving me nuts.

715
00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:19,388
Careful, Aunt Liz.

716
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:20,955
If you weren't blood related,

717
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,305
that type of talk
would get you straight kissed.

718
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:27,788
You know, it's very nice of you,
spending time with Jesse.

719
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:30,573
I was worried about her
with Shawn not here.

720
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:32,793
Well, she's fun to be around.

721
00:33:32,836 --> 00:33:34,534
I really like spending time
with her.

722
00:33:34,577 --> 00:33:37,058
Yeah.
I've been enjoying myself.

723
00:33:37,102 --> 00:33:39,060
I'm looking forward
to going to the dance with her.

724
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:40,627
Uh, Liz,

725
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:43,021
can you shut off
the main breaker, please?

726
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:44,848
- I'll take care of it.
- Don't. Don't be silly.

727
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:46,937
You and Jesse get going
to the dance.

728
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:49,331
I will go and figure out
what a breaker is.

729
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:51,507
Oh, I can't let you do...

730
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:53,509
It's okay.

731
00:33:56,382 --> 00:33:58,340
Hey.

732
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:02,083
Is it too much?

733
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:04,912
Oh... n-no.

734
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:06,696
Not at all.

735
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,655
You look real nice.

736
00:34:08,697 --> 00:34:11,440
You look like a disco ball

737
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:14,052
made sweet love
to a shootin' star.

738
00:34:14,617 --> 00:34:15,400
Mm.

739
00:34:15,444 --> 00:34:18,360
Like a diamond exploded.

740
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:20,493
Oof.

741
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:23,583
I believe that jumpsuit
will jump-start the whole dance.

742
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:27,239
Oh!

743
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:28,762
Oh, no... no... Polo!

744
00:34:28,804 --> 00:34:31,286
No, no, no. That...
Polo, come on.

745
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,636
It's very gracious of you, Polo,
to sit in the back seat.

746
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,551
But, uh, sorry.
You still can't come, buddy.

747
00:34:35,594 --> 00:34:37,466
Sorry, Polo. Human folk
just aren't there yet.

748
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,425
Come on! Come on, Polo.

749
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:42,254
Yeah.
All right.

750
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:44,777
- Bye, Polo.
- All right.

751
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:55,223
Here you go.

752
00:34:55,266 --> 00:34:57,834
- From the spiked bowl?
- Oh, of course.

753
00:34:57,878 --> 00:34:59,445
Oh, isn't that Becky?

754
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:01,621
Sweet Becky Ackerman.

755
00:35:01,664 --> 00:35:04,754
I see she did her own hair
tonight.

756
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:07,975
May I have this dance

757
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:10,499
with the most beautiful woman
in the room?

758
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:12,153
Honestly, Robert.

759
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:14,634
That line is 30 years old.

760
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:16,810
But it still works.

761
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:19,378
Come on.

762
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:21,467
A little friction and fantasy,
my dear.

763
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,164
Oh.

764
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:35,176
Look.

765
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,699
Oh, how tacky!

766
00:35:36,743 --> 00:35:39,746
She looks like
a giant fishing lure.

767
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:41,835
Ha.
Well, we know what she'safter.

768
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:44,620
Don't we, Darlene?
Mm-hmm.

769
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:53,673
Um, pardon me one second.

770
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:56,719
Hey.
You doing all right?

771
00:35:56,763 --> 00:36:00,549
I thought you said
we were gonna be old news.

772
00:36:01,115 --> 00:36:02,682
Oh.
Yeah.

773
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:05,467
Hey, let's dance.

774
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:07,469
Give them something
to really chew on.

775
00:36:07,513 --> 00:36:09,079
- I love it.
- All right.

776
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:10,777
Oh!

777
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,996
Whoa.
Okay.

778
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:16,217
- Hey!
- You got moves.

779
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:18,872
Well, you're easy to lead.

780
00:36:18,915 --> 00:36:20,526
- Yoo-hoo.
- Oh.

781
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:21,962
May I cut in?

782
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:24,747
Sorry, Beck.

783
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:26,532
Actually, uh,
I asked Jesse here to dance,

784
00:36:26,575 --> 00:36:28,142
and she kindly said yes.

785
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,275
So call me old-fashioned,
but I'm a...

786
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:32,407
I'm a one-partner type of guy.

787
00:36:33,147 --> 00:36:34,366
Oh.
Okay.

788
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:36,106
Well, I understand.

789
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,891
All right. Good.
No disrespect.

790
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:39,240
No.

791
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:40,720
- Old-fashioned.
- Yes.

792
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:43,113
- Have a good night.
- Bye, Becky.

793
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:46,247
I-I don't know.

794
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,336
Um, I think Becky might want

795
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,904
a little bit more
tree-house time with you.

796
00:36:50,947 --> 00:36:53,298
- Oh, that was a long time ago.
- Mm.

797
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:54,821
And it was nothing.
Really.

798
00:36:54,864 --> 00:36:57,302
- Nothing.
- It was just a kiss.

799
00:36:57,345 --> 00:36:59,652
Must have been some kiss.

800
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:00,957
Must have been.

801
00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:11,403
Ugh! Now she is trying to bang
Shawn's cousin.

802
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:13,318
Oh, that is so low.

803
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:16,234
Ho ho ho indeed!

804
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:20,368
We are dealing with a top-shelf
Christmas slut!

805
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:27,288
♪ Santa made it just for you

806
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,647
Oh, man. Look at that.

807
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:41,433
I could see someone
who's always wanted to drop down

808
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:43,173
on the fresh powder

809
00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:45,611
cutting a path
through uncharted territory.

810
00:37:45,654 --> 00:37:49,745
Just them, the wind, the sky...
and their emotions.

811
00:37:50,877 --> 00:37:52,313
- Ooh.
- You'd have mesold.

812
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:53,488
You kidding?

813
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:56,099
Them glossy pictures
did the selling.

814
00:37:56,143 --> 00:37:58,885
Wow. You got...
You got quite an eye.

815
00:37:58,928 --> 00:38:00,887
Two of them, actually.

816
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,541
You ever think about doing
this picture stuff

817
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:05,370
in a salaried,
non-amateur kind of way?

818
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:06,849
I'm talking bank-account stuff.

819
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:11,593
Uh, do you mean take pictures
as... as a full-time job?

820
00:38:11,637 --> 00:38:12,638
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

821
00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:14,466
Um, I would love to.

822
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:17,512
I've just...
never really considered it.

823
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:20,428
Sorry.
In the way.

824
00:38:20,472 --> 00:38:21,864
Jesse!

825
00:38:21,908 --> 00:38:24,171
Any chance that you're going
into town today?

826
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:28,262
Robert left both
of his reading glasses here,

827
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,785
and without them,

828
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:31,483
he will only be able to find
his lunch by smell.

829
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:33,180
Oh, I'll drop them off,
Aunt Liz.

830
00:38:33,223 --> 00:38:37,402
No. I need you here to go up
on the roof and do that man work

831
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:38,490
that you're so good at.

832
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:40,361
Otherwise, Robert will come home

833
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:42,494
and he will try to go up
on the roof by himself

834
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:45,888
and put up that showstopper
and tweak his sciatica.

835
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:48,369
- Hmm.
- Don't worry about it, Mrs. C.

836
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:50,589
I'll bring him the glasses.

837
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:58,510
Well, have fun on the roof.

838
00:38:58,553 --> 00:38:59,815
Thank you.

839
00:39:04,951 --> 00:39:06,300
- Knock, knock.
- Whoa.

840
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,171
Mr. C, I brought
your reading glasses.

841
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:09,912
Ah. Great.
Thank you.

842
00:39:09,956 --> 00:39:12,219
- You are such a lifesaver.
- You're right.

843
00:39:12,262 --> 00:39:14,352
It does seem a little bit
more quiet in here now.

844
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:19,531
Yeah. Yeah, probably more space
than I actually need anymore.

845
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:21,881
I should maybe think about
setting up shop

846
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:23,230
in the back of the drugstore
again.

847
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:24,927
- In the drugstore? Really?
- Yeah.

848
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:26,581
When I was first starting out,

849
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,454
I realized people love
to talk about what ails them.

850
00:39:29,497 --> 00:39:31,760
And I thought,
"This is a good segue

851
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:34,937
into talking about
managing their finances."

852
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:37,723
And let me tell you, it worked.

853
00:39:37,766 --> 00:39:39,551
I learned everything
there is to know

854
00:39:39,594 --> 00:39:41,379
about everyone in this town,

855
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:43,859
and all from the back
of that little drugstore.

856
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:45,905
- Mm-hmm.
- Despite what my father said.

857
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:48,560
What'd your father say?

858
00:39:48,603 --> 00:39:53,565
That it was impractical to... to
start into business on my own,

859
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:55,828
that I should stay
and work on the farm,

860
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:58,570
like I was incapable
of thinking work,

861
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:01,529
like I was some stupid fuck.

862
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:06,752
You know, I loved the old man,
and he definitely motivated me.

863
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:10,973
But sometimes
you just have to go for it.

864
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:18,981
Okay. Um... a hat.

865
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:20,461
Uh, Santa's hat.
Elf hat.

866
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:22,332
No. Uh, Scrooge.
Uh... Oh!

867
00:40:22,376 --> 00:40:23,595
- The Grinch! The Grinch!
- Yes!

868
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:24,813
"The Grinch
Who Stole Christmas"!

869
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:26,815
Oh, come on.

870
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:28,687
Wow.
I can't believe you got that.

871
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:31,298
- That... That was amazing.
- All right.

872
00:40:31,341 --> 00:40:33,082
No pressure,
but let's get this one

873
00:40:33,126 --> 00:40:34,867
so I don't get dog-talked
all night long.

874
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,347
Okay. I got you, Robert.
So I'm guessing.

875
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:38,653
- You're guessing.
- All right.

876
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,135
All right. Let's go.
You got this, Uncle Robert.

877
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:43,441
Uh, waves.

878
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:44,877
Uh... chicken...

879
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,487
Uh, hat.
Hand.

880
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:48,184
Uh, smoking hand.
Fire.

881
00:40:48,228 --> 00:40:49,359
- Fire!
- Y...

882
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:51,318
Uh... Uh... Uh... Af...
Uh, bonfire.

883
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:53,059
Fire... little specks.
Sparks.

884
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:55,148
Heat...
You want to touch the flame,

885
00:40:55,191 --> 00:40:57,019
but you can't because you know
it's gonna burn you.

886
00:40:57,063 --> 00:40:58,630
Uh, scar tissue
from previous relationships.

887
00:40:58,673 --> 00:40:59,892
Are you blind?!

888
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:01,807
Uh, b-balls. Hot balls.

889
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:03,199
Balls... T-Testicle...

890
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:06,681
Chestnuts!
Roasting on an open fire.

891
00:41:06,725 --> 00:41:08,553
Shawn!

892
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:10,772
- Hey! Surprise, everybody.
- Sweetheart!

893
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:12,208
Yes. My...

894
00:41:12,252 --> 00:41:14,210
Jesse.

895
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:16,822
Uh, what are you doing here?

896
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:19,085
I invited her.

897
00:41:19,128 --> 00:41:21,870
If you're upset,
be upset with me.

898
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:23,959
Uh, I will remember that.
Thank you.

899
00:41:24,003 --> 00:41:28,224
Uh, do you want to have
a little chat, maybe?

900
00:41:28,268 --> 00:41:29,443
Talk in private?

901
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:33,186
D... Yeah.
I have a private chat.

902
00:41:33,229 --> 00:41:35,710
Jesse, what the fuck?

903
00:41:35,754 --> 00:41:37,277
I don't want a big fight
about this.

904
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,235
I can understand
if you're a little upset.

905
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:41,324
I mean, upset?
It's not even that...

906
00:41:41,368 --> 00:41:42,717
I mean, I guess
I'm a little bit upset,

907
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:44,545
but frankly, I'm just surprised.

908
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:48,331
I mean, I'm shocked that...
that I'm seeing you right now.

909
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,029
I mean, help me understand this
a little bit.

910
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:51,596
So you got invited here.

911
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,598
Obviously you wanted to come
and what,

912
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:55,687
have some Christmas carbs
with my mom?

913
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,427
- What...
- Yeah.

914
00:41:57,471 --> 00:41:59,560
Yeah, that's exactly
what I wanted.

915
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:02,650
Okay.
Well, I can appreciate that.

916
00:42:02,694 --> 00:42:05,566
But let's walk the dog out just
a little bit farther on this,

917
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:08,656
because I don't see
how it plays out.

918
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,703
So... what,
this is an annual thing now?

919
00:42:11,746 --> 00:42:13,095
Because in one to three years,

920
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:14,706
I'm likely gonna be dating
somebody else,

921
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:16,795
and I'm gonna bring her home
for the holidays.

922
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:18,579
I don't know where you fit
into that.

923
00:42:18,623 --> 00:42:22,627
What, you stick around and take
our Christmas-card photos?

924
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,890
That sounds mean.
I don't mean it to be.

925
00:42:24,933 --> 00:42:27,762
But w... I-I don't see
how this ends well.

926
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:31,984
I love Christmas.

927
00:42:32,027 --> 00:42:34,160
- You know that.
- Yeah.

928
00:42:34,203 --> 00:42:37,729
And I didn't have
anywhere else to go.

929
00:42:37,772 --> 00:42:40,035
And I don't even have
enough money

930
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,733
to buy another plane ticket
out of here

931
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:45,084
two days before Christmas.
So, yeah, I...

932
00:42:45,127 --> 00:42:48,566
I guess I should have kept
walking the dog on that.

933
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,612
Well, I mean,
I don't want you to leave now.

934
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:53,309
- You don't?
- No.

935
00:42:53,353 --> 00:42:55,573
I mean, the... the drama
that this would cause?

936
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:57,270
Absolutely not.

937
00:42:57,313 --> 00:42:59,794
It would ruin
everybody's holiday.

938
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:02,188
We don't want to burden
everybody with this, right?

939
00:43:02,928 --> 00:43:05,321
Yeah. I-I agree.

940
00:43:05,365 --> 00:43:07,062
Great. Okay.
Deal.

941
00:43:07,106 --> 00:43:08,498
Well, I don't know.

942
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:10,675
I guess I'm just now wondering,
like...

943
00:43:10,718 --> 00:43:13,982
The last, lingering issue
is, like, could we just have

944
00:43:14,026 --> 00:43:16,855
one last, really enjoyable
holiday together?

945
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,771
Yeah.
I mean, that's...

946
00:43:19,814 --> 00:43:21,424
I-I don't understand
what you mean.

947
00:43:21,468 --> 00:43:23,339
What I mean is, is it weird

948
00:43:23,383 --> 00:43:26,125
that... I just want to kiss you
right now?

949
00:43:26,168 --> 00:43:27,648
Shawn, we are broken up.

950
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:29,519
- You broke up with me.
- I-I did.

951
00:43:29,563 --> 00:43:31,304
And I think the good thing
about that

952
00:43:31,347 --> 00:43:32,871
is that the pressure is off.

953
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:34,263
You know, we didn't make sense,

954
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:37,223
but what's wrong
with a little bit of fun?

955
00:43:37,266 --> 00:43:39,529
Don't you think
that would complicate things?

956
00:43:40,052 --> 00:43:42,184
I can't imagine that it would.

957
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:43,882
I mean, I don't have
all the answers,

958
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:47,842
but all I know is that I cannot
stop getting stared at

959
00:43:47,886 --> 00:43:51,106
by this fella right here
who's got the red nose

960
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,542
and the rock-hard ears.

961
00:43:52,586 --> 00:43:54,066
He's looking at me,
and he's going,

962
00:43:54,109 --> 00:43:56,024
"What does Shawn want
for Christmas?"

963
00:43:56,068 --> 00:43:57,678
You know?
His words, not mine.

964
00:43:57,722 --> 00:43:59,898
I-I can just read it
on his face.

965
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:02,204
Mm-hmm.

966
00:44:02,248 --> 00:44:04,946
Well, I need some time
to think about it.

967
00:44:06,948 --> 00:44:09,124
If you say so.

968
00:44:10,952 --> 00:44:13,825
I'm just gonna put these in
the dishwasher and head to bed.

969
00:44:13,868 --> 00:44:15,783
So, anyway,
the interview was aces.

970
00:44:15,827 --> 00:44:18,917
Turns out this guy also does
body sculpt... same as me.

971
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,701
X1, same as me.

972
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:24,705
I should be X2, but my sensei
died on the way to the ceremony.

973
00:44:24,749 --> 00:44:27,012
Hit-and-run. It's actually
a really funny story.

974
00:44:27,055 --> 00:44:28,709
- Oh.
- But... Don't worry about it.

975
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:30,711
Bottom line, I'm moving on
to the next round of interviews,

976
00:44:30,755 --> 00:44:31,930
guaranteed.

977
00:44:31,973 --> 00:44:33,540
They were loving it.
Job in the bag.

978
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:34,933
- That's fantastic.
- Thank you.

979
00:44:34,976 --> 00:44:37,326
When you talk about sculpting
the body,

980
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:39,198
what... what medium
are they working in?

981
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:40,547
Clay?
What are we talking about?

982
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:42,592
No, no. I mean mine.
We're talking...

983
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:44,638
- Human flesh?
- Oh, yeah. Tip to taint.

984
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,119
Ah. Silly old me just goes
outside and swings an ax.

985
00:44:47,162 --> 00:44:48,555
What do I know?

986
00:44:48,598 --> 00:44:50,078
And you do this in a facility?

987
00:44:50,122 --> 00:44:52,124
You make it sound like
it's a mental asylum.

988
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:54,213
Well, it's late.

989
00:44:54,256 --> 00:44:56,215
I think we should all go to bed.

990
00:44:56,258 --> 00:44:57,738
I guess I'll be heading out,
then.

991
00:44:57,782 --> 00:44:59,392
- Peace out.
- Absolutely not!

992
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:00,785
You will stay here.

993
00:45:00,828 --> 00:45:03,004
No, no, no. I don't want
to cramp anyone's space.

994
00:45:03,048 --> 00:45:05,137
Don't be ridiculous.
You can sleep in Shawn's room.

995
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:08,053
Well, I mean, I couldlay
my head down for a little bit

996
00:45:08,096 --> 00:45:09,663
if it's not stepping on toes.

997
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,796
Lay it down.
Move it around.

998
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,754
- Who gives a crap? Stick around.
- That's fantastic.

999
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:14,929
Let me get my hands
on your neck.

1000
00:45:14,973 --> 00:45:16,409
- Yeah. Mm!
- Thank you, Shawn.

1001
00:45:16,452 --> 00:45:17,845
- That felt good.
- I love you.

1002
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:19,760
Thank you for all the love
and hospitality.

1003
00:45:19,804 --> 00:45:21,283
What the... What wasthat?

1004
00:45:21,327 --> 00:45:24,243
I feel like you got Chap Stick
on my neck.

1005
00:45:28,203 --> 00:45:29,422
- Hey.
- Hey.

1006
00:45:29,465 --> 00:45:30,858
- I was just gonna floss.
- Yeah. Please.

1007
00:45:30,902 --> 00:45:32,468
Go ahead. Go first.
I'm not even tired.

1008
00:45:32,512 --> 00:45:34,557
Ooh. I got to wee-wee first
if that's cool.

1009
00:45:34,601 --> 00:45:36,603
Long day.
I'm exhausted!

1010
00:45:36,646 --> 00:45:38,344
Hey.

1011
00:45:38,387 --> 00:45:40,738
Hey, dibs on my bed, by the way.
I shouldn't have to say that.

1012
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:47,222
Um, I hope you have
a good night.

1013
00:45:47,266 --> 00:45:49,616
You too.
I hope you have a-a good night.

1014
00:45:50,399 --> 00:45:52,358
Looks like I'm gonna get more
than I bargained for in here,

1015
00:45:52,401 --> 00:45:55,361
so... I'd scurry.

1016
00:45:57,102 --> 00:45:59,060
I just think
that the most important thing

1017
00:45:59,104 --> 00:46:00,627
that I could probably say,
and...

1018
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,934
Hey, are you guys...
How long is this gonna take?

1019
00:46:02,977 --> 00:46:04,805
'Cause I might be a while
in here

1020
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:09,767
and I'm... not digging
any of this.

1021
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:17,949
Hey, D-Train,
you want to do me a favor?

1022
00:46:17,992 --> 00:46:19,777
Run downstairs,
grab me a book of matches.

1023
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,610
I'm not gonna go in there
for a while.

1024
00:46:27,654 --> 00:46:29,656
That's smart, probably.

1025
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:35,009
Robert, what are you doing?

1026
00:46:35,531 --> 00:46:37,664
Oh.
I'm a little stressed.

1027
00:46:37,707 --> 00:46:39,884
I want to slip out
and take a hit.

1028
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:43,104
Well, thank you
for being honest,

1029
00:46:43,148 --> 00:46:46,804
but, oh, Robert, you've been
off of it for a whole year.

1030
00:46:46,847 --> 00:46:49,763
Yeah, but I-I will quit
right after Christmas.

1031
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,069
Promise?

1032
00:46:51,112 --> 00:46:52,200
Yeah.
Sure.

1033
00:46:52,244 --> 00:46:55,116
Make it official.

1034
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:58,032
I promise that I will stop
huffing paint

1035
00:46:58,076 --> 00:46:59,860
right after Christmas.

1036
00:46:59,904 --> 00:47:03,385
Okay.
I appreciate your honesty.

1037
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:06,171
Enjoy.
Come back nice and hazy.

1038
00:47:06,214 --> 00:47:08,564
I'm going to blindfold you,
and we're going to play a game

1039
00:47:08,608 --> 00:47:10,653
where you try to guess
what you're touching.

1040
00:47:11,654 --> 00:47:14,135
Perfect.

1041
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,411
Ugh! Dude, I can't sleep
with a dog in here.

1042
00:47:29,455 --> 00:47:31,761
Yeah.
He always sleeps by my side.

1043
00:47:31,805 --> 00:47:33,763
Yeah.
Well, what the fuck?

1044
00:47:33,807 --> 00:47:34,939
A dog in the bedroom?

1045
00:47:34,982 --> 00:47:36,592
I mean, I usually wake up

1046
00:47:36,636 --> 00:47:38,377
with a nice big bowling pin
in my pants,

1047
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,596
but that ain't gonna happen
if this little mutt is in here.

1048
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,033
Okay?
I'm sneezing like crazy.

1049
00:47:42,076 --> 00:47:43,817
Maybe the dog sleeps outside.

1050
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,167
Well, he won't be able to sleep
away from me.

1051
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:48,213
Yeah. Well, I can't sleep
with him in here.

1052
00:47:49,344 --> 00:47:51,781
All right.
We'll hit the couch.

1053
00:47:51,825 --> 00:47:53,392
- Yeah?
- Come on, buddy.

1054
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:56,351
- Come on, Polo. Let's go.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1055
00:47:56,395 --> 00:47:58,440
Actually, uh, it's a good call,
'cause the couch

1056
00:47:58,484 --> 00:48:00,747
is actually a lot better
than this dumb old air mattress.

1057
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:02,836
You just upgraded, I swear.

1058
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,185
Mm!

1059
00:48:13,716 --> 00:48:14,717
Polo.

1060
00:48:14,761 --> 00:48:17,329
Hey.

1061
00:48:17,372 --> 00:48:19,940
Polo.

1062
00:48:19,984 --> 00:48:21,507
Hey, buddy.

1063
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:23,813
Polo.

1064
00:48:48,534 --> 00:48:50,623
Traitor.

1065
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,495
So...

1066
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:57,499
I have everybody's stocking
except David's.

1067
00:48:57,543 --> 00:48:59,632
Ah. Well, that makes two of us.

1068
00:48:59,675 --> 00:49:00,981
Well, you've got to get one.

1069
00:49:01,025 --> 00:49:03,114
And you have to have
your first name

1070
00:49:03,157 --> 00:49:05,464
and last initial stitched on it.

1071
00:49:05,507 --> 00:49:07,857
And, Shawn, I need you
to get yours from the attic.

1072
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:09,163
I'm on it.

1073
00:49:09,207 --> 00:49:11,600
Hey, uh, Dad,
you going into Ketchum

1074
00:49:11,644 --> 00:49:13,994
and doing some
responsible accounting?

1075
00:49:14,038 --> 00:49:15,778
Yes, sir, I am.

1076
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:19,173
It beats sitting here, shoveling
muffins down my throat all day.

1077
00:49:19,217 --> 00:49:21,001
Well, we can't have that.

1078
00:49:21,045 --> 00:49:24,831
Mind if, uh, I tag along
with you, there, Pop-peroni?

1079
00:49:24,874 --> 00:49:27,225
- I would love that.
- Okay.

1080
00:49:27,268 --> 00:49:29,270
Ever since Shirley went
into rehab,

1081
00:49:29,314 --> 00:49:30,619
the place has gone to hell.

1082
00:49:30,663 --> 00:49:32,186
- Sweet.
- Yeah.

1083
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:35,015
Not sweet but...
good she's getting help.

1084
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:40,151
Jesse, this smelled bad,
but it tastes good.

1085
00:49:40,194 --> 00:49:41,804
I'm gonna need the recipe.

1086
00:49:42,892 --> 00:49:43,937
No problem.

1087
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,941
Well... I'm off to the mop shop.

1088
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,988
Uh, I guess I'll stop
at the deli for dinner.

1089
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:52,337
- I'm happy to do it.
- I can take care of dinner.

1090
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,035
Oh, you're lifesavers.

1091
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:56,558
So I'll see everybody later
and...

1092
00:49:56,602 --> 00:49:58,996
Oh, got to carve out 13 minutes

1093
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,823
for our special tub time,
Robert.

1094
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:04,697
Ixnay on the ubtimetay.

1095
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,177
Well, it's Wednesday, right?

1096
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,179
- Already? Wow.
- See you later.

1097
00:50:08,222 --> 00:50:09,789
Thanks for everything, Aunt Liz.

1098
00:50:09,832 --> 00:50:12,531
Okay. Those numbers are not
gonna crunch themselves.

1099
00:50:12,574 --> 00:50:14,185
- Mm. Yep.
- Here you go.

1100
00:50:14,228 --> 00:50:16,361
I know you like your fruit
in the morning.

1101
00:50:16,404 --> 00:50:20,321
Grazie.Yes. Fruit and...
any other kind of sweet treat.

1102
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:22,062
All right.

1103
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:23,933
Oh, do you have any other plans
for yourself today

1104
00:50:23,977 --> 00:50:25,761
besides just picking up dinner?

1105
00:50:25,805 --> 00:50:28,503
Um, I was gonna take out my
camera and shoot some pictures.

1106
00:50:28,547 --> 00:50:30,288
That's wonderful.
Well, keep it primed.

1107
00:50:30,331 --> 00:50:33,508
Stay in the zone.
And I'm off like a prom dress.

1108
00:50:35,467 --> 00:50:38,165
Say, Jesse,
seeing as there's only one car,

1109
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:40,602
I hear tell there's a valley
off Route 40

1110
00:50:40,646 --> 00:50:42,343
that's supposed to be stunning.

1111
00:50:42,387 --> 00:50:43,692
I could drop you off there

1112
00:50:43,736 --> 00:50:45,738
to capture some
of your camera magic,

1113
00:50:45,781 --> 00:50:48,697
then go to the Christmas market,
grab the stocking,

1114
00:50:48,741 --> 00:50:52,092
quickly embroider my name
and last initial, hit the deli,

1115
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:55,008
then swing back and pick you up
on my way back.

1116
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:58,185
If you're offering me a ride,
that's great.

1117
00:50:58,229 --> 00:51:00,796
- I'll take great for an answer.
- Great.

1118
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,711
What's up, Beef?

1119
00:51:02,755 --> 00:51:05,714
Uh, a few things I need
for the folks.

1120
00:51:05,758 --> 00:51:09,240
Peanut butter, crunchy,
one-ply toilet paper,

1121
00:51:09,283 --> 00:51:12,678
grape soda, and cough syrup...
Family size if you have it.

1122
00:51:12,721 --> 00:51:16,899
Oh, and do you know where I can
get some lingerie around here?

1123
00:51:16,943 --> 00:51:20,251
Something, you know, with, like,
the sort of clear-plastic,

1124
00:51:20,294 --> 00:51:22,079
like revealing plates

1125
00:51:22,122 --> 00:51:24,777
and the, you know,
sort of something high-cut,

1126
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,126
you know, '80s style.

1127
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,954
Buying it for a special lady?

1128
00:51:27,997 --> 00:51:31,262
Yeah.
A little present for my mom.

1129
00:51:35,353 --> 00:51:36,919
This valley is spectacular.

1130
00:51:36,963 --> 00:51:38,530
Yeah.

1131
00:51:38,573 --> 00:51:42,273
Well, uh, I'll be back
in a little bit to pick you up.

1132
00:51:42,316 --> 00:51:44,275
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1133
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:47,147
I mean, it wasa little crazy
that Shawn showed up, right?

1134
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:49,149
I mean, at first I was...
It was awkward,

1135
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:53,762
but then we connected
and came... together.

1136
00:51:54,285 --> 00:51:56,548
Well, whatever winds your watch.

1137
00:51:56,591 --> 00:51:59,420
I just hope everything turns out
the way you wish.

1138
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,075
Polo, let's go!

1139
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,860
- Polo! Come on! Let's go.
- Where is he?

1140
00:52:04,904 --> 00:52:07,211
Oh, he probably got the scent
of something.

1141
00:52:07,254 --> 00:52:08,908
He'll be back.
Polo!

1142
00:52:08,951 --> 00:52:10,997
Polo!
Come on!

1143
00:52:12,085 --> 00:52:14,348
He usually comes
when I call him.

1144
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:16,133
Oh, there's his tracks.

1145
00:52:16,176 --> 00:52:17,395
Aw, hell.

1146
00:52:17,438 --> 00:52:20,006
Polo!
Polo!

1147
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:22,313
- Dad.
- Uh, yeah.

1148
00:52:22,356 --> 00:52:23,531
Shirley die 10 years ago?

1149
00:52:23,575 --> 00:52:24,837
This place is
a fucking disaster.

1150
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,317
She's not dead.
She's in rehab.

1151
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,275
And it's only been a month.

1152
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:31,409
Uh, I'm happy to throw on some
rubber gloves and a hazmat suit

1153
00:52:31,452 --> 00:52:33,498
and help you make sense
of this mess if you want.

1154
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:35,021
Okay.

1155
00:52:35,064 --> 00:52:37,197
You go ahead
and organize everything.

1156
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:41,810
I will go over to the post
office and mail some returns.

1157
00:52:41,854 --> 00:52:43,595
Pony Express
isn't coming through today?

1158
00:52:43,638 --> 00:52:45,771
You know, you can file
those online, right, Dad?

1159
00:52:45,814 --> 00:52:47,468
Yeah.
I like to mail things.

1160
00:52:47,512 --> 00:52:49,731
I'm gonna take a bath later,
so maybe we could, you know,

1161
00:52:49,775 --> 00:52:51,342
boil some water over a cauldron.

1162
00:52:51,385 --> 00:52:53,213
And we can take it out
of this water cooler

1163
00:52:53,257 --> 00:52:55,302
that you bought during the
fucking Harding administration.

1164
00:52:55,346 --> 00:52:56,869
All right.
I'll be back.

1165
00:52:56,912 --> 00:52:58,827
- All right.
- Geez!

1166
00:53:06,313 --> 00:53:08,794
Hello?
Mr. Campbell?

1167
00:53:08,837 --> 00:53:10,883
Becky Ackerman?

1168
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:13,190
Hi, Shawn.

1169
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:16,105
I heard that you weren't
coming home for Christmas.

1170
00:53:16,149 --> 00:53:17,629
Well, plans change.

1171
00:53:17,672 --> 00:53:19,326
Do you have an appointment
to see the old man?

1172
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:22,155
I just need to file
my first year-end.

1173
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,462
Becky's Bakery.
It's my very own business now.

1174
00:53:24,505 --> 00:53:26,159
It's pretty impressive.
Yeah.

1175
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,248
He just popped down
to the post office for a bit,

1176
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,729
but I'm happy to look over
whatever you want, up and down.

1177
00:53:30,772 --> 00:53:33,253
Oh.
Well, okay.

1178
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:35,037
I just... I need him to file,

1179
00:53:35,081 --> 00:53:38,084
because I already got my hands
dirty crunching all the numbers.

1180
00:53:38,127 --> 00:53:39,390
Hmm.

1181
00:53:39,433 --> 00:53:42,306
I applied all
of my online custom orders

1182
00:53:42,349 --> 00:53:44,264
as a separate contract.

1183
00:53:44,308 --> 00:53:47,136
Lowered my overall gross by 10%.

1184
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,269
- You did all this yourself?
- I did.

1185
00:53:49,313 --> 00:53:51,445
I like getting my hands
on things.

1186
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:54,753
Working it... like numbers.

1187
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:58,322
Almost as much as I love baking.

1188
00:53:58,365 --> 00:54:00,454
Hmm.

1189
00:54:00,498 --> 00:54:03,414
Wow.
Well...

1190
00:54:03,457 --> 00:54:05,242
I can't believe these numbers
are for a startup.

1191
00:54:05,285 --> 00:54:06,982
That's incredible.

1192
00:54:07,026 --> 00:54:08,854
You know, it is a real skill
to, uh,

1193
00:54:08,897 --> 00:54:11,422
be able to grow something bigger
and then maintain it.

1194
00:54:11,465 --> 00:54:15,208
I like watching things grow,
especially profits.

1195
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:16,992
You know, you should come by
and check it out.

1196
00:54:17,036 --> 00:54:21,083
I made a fresh batch
of eggnog macaroons.

1197
00:54:21,127 --> 00:54:23,216
If you have an appetite
for that kind of thing.

1198
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,000
Might just have to take you up
on that.

1199
00:54:25,044 --> 00:54:27,786
Consider it a final invitation.

1200
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,535
She's horny as fuck.

1201
00:54:37,578 --> 00:54:39,363
Polo!

1202
00:54:39,406 --> 00:54:41,408
Hey, buddy!
Come on!

1203
00:54:41,452 --> 00:54:43,323
Polo!
Oh, hey.

1204
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:45,238
- His tracks are over here.
- Oh.

1205
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:48,154
He must have got the scent
of something real special.

1206
00:54:48,197 --> 00:54:51,070
Something he's a hard time
getting out of his mind.

1207
00:54:51,113 --> 00:54:52,550
Polo!

1208
00:54:52,593 --> 00:54:54,726
I got to find him.

1209
00:54:55,727 --> 00:54:57,337
Whoa.

1210
00:54:57,381 --> 00:54:59,121
Is that the wishing tree?

1211
00:54:59,731 --> 00:55:01,472
It's got to be.

1212
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:08,957
I can't believe we found it.

1213
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:11,264
This is...

1214
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,919
It's just in the middle
of nowhere.

1215
00:55:13,962 --> 00:55:16,269
This is... This is wild.

1216
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,706
I told you it could be
your lucky year.

1217
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:21,013
Well, now what?

1218
00:55:21,056 --> 00:55:24,233
Well... I think we make a wish.

1219
00:55:24,277 --> 00:55:25,887
You got one?

1220
00:55:25,931 --> 00:55:28,542
I wouldn't trust a man
who didn't.

1221
00:55:28,586 --> 00:55:30,283
Me neither.

1222
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,851
- All right. On three.
- Yeah?

1223
00:55:32,894 --> 00:55:36,158
- One, two...
- One, two...

1224
00:55:36,202 --> 00:55:38,117
- ...three.
- ...three.

1225
00:55:44,471 --> 00:55:45,472
Good?

1226
00:55:45,516 --> 00:55:47,082
Very good.
You?

1227
00:55:47,126 --> 00:55:48,301
- Yeah!
- All right.

1228
00:55:49,911 --> 00:55:52,740
There you are,
you little rascal!

1229
00:55:52,784 --> 00:55:54,873
- Here you are!
- Oh!

1230
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:57,528
What were you doing?
Polo!

1231
00:55:57,571 --> 00:56:00,226
Well, let's go find
your stocking.

1232
00:56:00,269 --> 00:56:02,620
After you.
After Polo. Come on!

1233
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:03,751
Come on, buddy!

1234
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:09,235
Oh, man.

1235
00:56:09,278 --> 00:56:12,456
They are gonna be mighty
buffaloed that we found it.

1236
00:56:12,499 --> 00:56:14,371
I don't think
they should be toosurprised,

1237
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:17,243
'cause we do have a knack for
seeking out the extraordinary.

1238
00:56:17,286 --> 00:56:19,114
I mean, look at the stocking.

1239
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:21,813
That's true.
I tell that.

1240
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,773
Is that Shawn?

1241
00:56:25,817 --> 00:56:27,384
Uh, I reckon it is.

1242
00:56:28,515 --> 00:56:29,734
Ah.
Should we say hi?

1243
00:56:29,777 --> 00:56:30,865
Yeah.
Let's do it.

1244
00:56:35,304 --> 00:56:36,784
I cannot believe
how good these are.

1245
00:56:36,828 --> 00:56:39,657
- These are igniting my mouth!
- Thank you.

1246
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,920
You know, looking at you,
I would never guess that, uh,

1247
00:56:41,963 --> 00:56:43,443
you had such a sweet tooth.

1248
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:45,880
You know that's right.
But I do.

1249
00:56:45,924 --> 00:56:48,622
Hey. You? Have a sweet tooth?
No way.

1250
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:49,928
Who knew?

1251
00:56:49,971 --> 00:56:51,756
Jesse, have you been
to Becky's shop?

1252
00:56:51,799 --> 00:56:54,454
No, I haven't.
Oh, it's beautiful.

1253
00:56:54,498 --> 00:56:57,370
I mean, it is insane.

1254
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,980
This business
is really going places.

1255
00:56:59,024 --> 00:57:00,808
I'm talking branding,
franchising.

1256
00:57:00,852 --> 00:57:03,115
- That's what I was thinking.
- Yeah.

1257
00:57:03,158 --> 00:57:06,248
Hey, David, you get your mouth
around my Nanaimo?

1258
00:57:06,292 --> 00:57:09,382
I sure did, and it was
finger-lickin', as always.

1259
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,776
My mouth can't get enough
of your tasty treats, Becky.

1260
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:13,386
- You know that.
- I tried it, too,

1261
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,735
and it was delicious.

1262
00:57:14,779 --> 00:57:16,781
Oh, yeah.
Listen.

1263
00:57:16,824 --> 00:57:19,044
We should probably get going,
grab some stuff from the deli.

1264
00:57:19,087 --> 00:57:20,567
Shawn, I don't know
if you need a ride

1265
00:57:20,611 --> 00:57:22,482
or you're gonna hang here
with Mrs. Taste Good.

1266
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:25,616
- Taste Good.
- That is an apt nickname.

1267
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:28,619
But no, I think I'll finish
Dad's stuff back at the house,

1268
00:57:28,662 --> 00:57:30,359
so yeah, I'll hitch a ride.

1269
00:57:30,403 --> 00:57:33,232
Um, not to be a greedy Gary,
but, uh,

1270
00:57:33,275 --> 00:57:36,409
could I just wrap my mouth
around one more of these,

1271
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,845
like, for the ride home?

1272
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:39,238
You can wrap your mouth
around all of them.

1273
00:57:39,281 --> 00:57:40,544
- Get out.
- Take the whole box, please.

1274
00:57:40,587 --> 00:57:41,893
- The whole box?
- Take it. Please. Please.

1275
00:57:41,936 --> 00:57:43,198
- The whole box?
- Please, please, please, please.

1276
00:57:43,242 --> 00:57:44,852
I'm not gonna protest. Okay.

1277
00:57:44,896 --> 00:57:46,767
- Thank you.
- Later, Beck.

1278
00:57:46,811 --> 00:57:47,855
Bye, you guys.

1279
00:57:47,899 --> 00:57:48,900
- See ya.
- Hey, Becky?

1280
00:57:48,943 --> 00:57:50,510
- Yeah.
- Bye-bye.

1281
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:51,772
I'll see you, Beck.

1282
00:57:51,816 --> 00:57:53,078
Bye.

1283
00:57:53,121 --> 00:57:54,862
Whoop.

1284
00:57:54,906 --> 00:57:56,385
Snowball!
Bye, Becky.

1285
00:57:56,429 --> 00:57:57,299
- Bye, Becky.
- Bye.

1286
00:58:00,651 --> 00:58:02,479
Okay.

1287
00:58:02,522 --> 00:58:07,484
Well, before we dig in, uh, I'd
like to just say a few words.

1288
00:58:08,397 --> 00:58:10,443
Dear Lord, um,

1289
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,228
thank You for bringing
the whole family together

1290
00:58:13,272 --> 00:58:16,754
on this most blessed holiday.

1291
00:58:16,797 --> 00:58:17,929
- Amen.
- Amen.

1292
00:58:17,972 --> 00:58:19,452
- Amen.
- Amen.

1293
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,585
I know you guys are not
going to believe this,

1294
00:58:21,628 --> 00:58:24,152
but today David and I found
the wishing tree.

1295
00:58:24,196 --> 00:58:25,763
What?

1296
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:27,591
Get the fuck out of here.
We could never find that thing.

1297
00:58:27,634 --> 00:58:29,114
I know.

1298
00:58:29,157 --> 00:58:31,029
It actually had more to do
with fate than luck.

1299
00:58:31,072 --> 00:58:32,726
Polo led us right to it.

1300
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:34,511
- Ohh!
- How about that? Okay.

1301
00:58:34,554 --> 00:58:36,251
So... where is it?

1302
00:58:36,295 --> 00:58:38,123
What'd you wish for?

1303
00:58:38,166 --> 00:58:39,646
You know I can't tell you that.

1304
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:42,344
Yeah. Nice one.
What'd you wish for?

1305
00:58:42,388 --> 00:58:44,869
Shawn, you know the rules.

1306
00:58:44,912 --> 00:58:47,480
Uh, I do, but it's horseshit.

1307
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,786
You don't believe this stuff,
do you?

1308
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:50,004
Of course I do.

1309
00:58:50,048 --> 00:58:52,180
Uh, okay.
Fine.

1310
00:58:52,224 --> 00:58:54,922
Never you mind.
David, out with it, pal.

1311
00:58:54,966 --> 00:58:57,751
Don't look at me, man.
I want my wish to come true.

1312
00:58:57,795 --> 00:59:00,972
You guys are about
as lame as a two-legged dog.

1313
00:59:01,015 --> 00:59:03,757
All right. Fine.
Wishes are secrets, apparently.

1314
00:59:03,801 --> 00:59:05,846
News flash to moi.

1315
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:09,546
Either way, I did want to, uh,
on a sincere note,

1316
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:11,722
raise a glass
and just say a couple of words.

1317
00:59:11,765 --> 00:59:12,766
That's nice.

1318
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,638
I've been killing it recently.

1319
00:59:14,681 --> 00:59:17,031
This past year has been
an embarrassment

1320
00:59:17,075 --> 00:59:22,646
of financial success,
sexual, uh, adventures,

1321
00:59:22,689 --> 00:59:26,301
and the year ahead is gonna be
probably twice that.

1322
00:59:26,345 --> 00:59:28,129
- Ah. Cheer...
- And I have all the... Hold on.

1323
00:59:28,173 --> 00:59:30,567
I have all the skills, charisma,
and talent in the world,

1324
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:32,830
and it's all just sort of
coalescing at one time

1325
00:59:32,873 --> 00:59:35,702
in a really amazing,
kind of scary way, frankly.

1326
00:59:35,746 --> 00:59:38,879
I'm not sure what to do with it,
but, uh, thanks to me, I guess.

1327
00:59:38,923 --> 00:59:40,402
Uh, and, you know...

1328
00:59:40,446 --> 00:59:41,882
And that's withoutfinding
the wishing tree.

1329
00:59:41,926 --> 00:59:45,277
So God forbid I ever do find it.
Game over.

1330
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,975
And I'm very glad you're here.

1331
00:59:48,846 --> 00:59:49,803
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

1332
00:59:49,847 --> 00:59:50,935
- All right.
- Cheers.

1333
00:59:50,978 --> 00:59:52,284
Hear, hear. Cheers.

1334
00:59:52,327 --> 00:59:53,415
Okay, sweetie.

1335
00:59:53,459 --> 00:59:54,982
- Well said.
- Thank you.

1336
00:59:57,724 --> 00:59:59,944
You never really did settle down
on a town

1337
00:59:59,987 --> 01:00:02,294
with, like, a job, did you?

1338
01:00:02,947 --> 01:00:05,689
No, I never did chain myself
to a paycheck.

1339
01:00:05,732 --> 01:00:08,082
I guess I was too fond
of having the sun on my face

1340
01:00:08,126 --> 01:00:10,171
- and the wind on my back.
- Ah.

1341
01:00:10,215 --> 01:00:13,000
Well, I'm gonna go upstairs
and upload some photos.

1342
01:00:13,044 --> 01:00:15,176
Oh. You been taking a lot
of pics since you got here?

1343
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,657
Yeah, I have.
It's been really inspiring.

1344
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:19,659
- It's great here.
- Oh, they're amazing.

1345
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:21,530
- Thank you.
- Really, truly.

1346
01:00:21,574 --> 01:00:22,793
Well, it sounds like you guys

1347
01:00:22,836 --> 01:00:24,316
have been on quite
the adventure,

1348
01:00:24,359 --> 01:00:26,971
and I'm just glad you came away
unscathed, Jesse.

1349
01:00:28,537 --> 01:00:31,845
Great. Um, my buns have been
roasting by this open fire,

1350
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:34,543
so I'm gonna turn in
for the night.

1351
01:00:34,587 --> 01:00:35,457
- Okay.
- Good night.

1352
01:00:35,501 --> 01:00:37,634
- Well, night.
- Night.

1353
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,334
Anyway, I'm glad
she's excited about it.

1354
01:00:42,377 --> 01:00:45,467
But this nature-photography
shit, there's no future in that.

1355
01:00:45,511 --> 01:00:48,557
Well, you know, actually, Shawn,
I was thinking about asking her

1356
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:51,822
to shoot some photos
for my brochure.

1357
01:00:51,865 --> 01:00:53,562
I think those pictures

1358
01:00:53,606 --> 01:00:55,564
could really help sell
the experience for my clients.

1359
01:00:55,608 --> 01:00:58,045
You know, you say "brochure"
in a funny way.

1360
01:00:58,089 --> 01:01:00,831
- But I could see that.
- You say "catalog"?

1361
01:01:00,874 --> 01:01:03,137
- No, it's just...
- You don't say "brochure"?

1362
01:01:03,181 --> 01:01:04,356
- "Bro-sure"?
- Brochure.

1363
01:01:04,399 --> 01:01:05,662
What are you saying?

1364
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:06,967
That's right.

1365
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:10,492
So, how about you?

1366
01:01:10,536 --> 01:01:12,973
You trying to get into
some big-city firm, right?

1367
01:01:13,017 --> 01:01:14,845
Ah, maybe.
I'm thinking about it.

1368
01:01:14,888 --> 01:01:18,500
I mean, this firm wants me
so fucking bad, I can taste it.

1369
01:01:18,544 --> 01:01:20,241
But, you know, I don't know.

1370
01:01:20,285 --> 01:01:22,156
You want to be a small fish
in a big pond?

1371
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,375
Big fish in a small pond?

1372
01:01:23,418 --> 01:01:24,811
It's the age-old question,
right?

1373
01:01:24,855 --> 01:01:26,247
As long as I'm near anypond,

1374
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:27,945
- I'm happy, right?
- That's not the point.

1375
01:01:27,988 --> 01:01:30,861
The point is, my dad knows
all of his clients personally.

1376
01:01:30,904 --> 01:01:32,079
- You know?
- That's nice.

1377
01:01:32,123 --> 01:01:34,168
You know, like Becky.

1378
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:36,649
Yeah.

1379
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,695
Kind of makes you think.

1380
01:01:40,914 --> 01:01:42,394
Right.

1381
01:01:46,572 --> 01:01:47,834
Think about Becky?

1382
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:51,229
Yeah.

1383
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,101
Yeah.

1384
01:01:54,145 --> 01:01:55,494
Becky.

1385
01:01:55,537 --> 01:01:56,713
Right.

1386
01:02:00,064 --> 01:02:02,066
Mm.

1387
01:02:04,938 --> 01:02:06,679
Mm.

1388
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,203
Mm.

1389
01:02:10,988 --> 01:02:13,555
What rhymes
with "Christmas tree"?

1390
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,514
I don't know.

1391
01:02:16,123 --> 01:02:17,603
Time to hump.

1392
01:02:17,646 --> 01:02:19,997
Okay.
That doesn't rhyme at all.

1393
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:23,435
It does now.

1394
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:31,312
Hey, Mrs. C.
Where are you off to?

1395
01:02:31,356 --> 01:02:34,228
Wendy McManus tried to
straighten her own hair,

1396
01:02:34,272 --> 01:02:36,056
- and now it's dry.
- Mm.

1397
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,755
I have to go perform
a Christmas miracle.

1398
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:43,455
Could you finish stitching
David's name on his stocking?

1399
01:02:43,498 --> 01:02:45,152
Of course.

1400
01:02:45,196 --> 01:02:47,111
And Shawn is at
his father's office all day.

1401
01:02:47,154 --> 01:02:48,721
- Catch you at dinner.
- You bet.

1402
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,201
I'll start on the finger foods
for the party.

1403
01:02:50,244 --> 01:02:51,855
Okay.

1404
01:03:01,952 --> 01:03:03,170
Ow.

1405
01:03:03,214 --> 01:03:05,651
Oh.

1406
01:03:05,694 --> 01:03:06,913
Ow.

1407
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:11,396
What?

1408
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,878
You okay?

1409
01:03:14,921 --> 01:03:16,183
Oh.

1410
01:03:16,227 --> 01:03:19,099
Yeah. Yeah.
I-I just poked myself.

1411
01:03:20,361 --> 01:03:22,624
I know Aunt Liz used to keep
a bunch of Band-Aids

1412
01:03:22,668 --> 01:03:24,322
in that drawer.

1413
01:03:25,192 --> 01:03:27,107
I should know.
Yep.

1414
01:03:27,151 --> 01:03:29,457
I went through a ton of them
every visit.

1415
01:03:29,501 --> 01:03:30,937
That's very surprising.

1416
01:03:32,591 --> 01:03:35,115
Give me that finger.

1417
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:37,857
You don't do this on my behalf,
I hope.

1418
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:38,815
No.

1419
01:03:38,858 --> 01:03:40,425
You know Mrs. C.

1420
01:03:40,468 --> 01:03:42,427
Everyone's stocking
has to have their name.

1421
01:03:44,298 --> 01:03:46,431
And last initial.

1422
01:03:46,474 --> 01:03:48,041
Mm.
Exactly.

1423
01:03:48,085 --> 01:03:50,652
I sincerely appreciate
the effort.

1424
01:03:50,696 --> 01:03:52,350
Anything for Christmas.

1425
01:03:56,049 --> 01:03:58,443
You know, Jesse, um...

1426
01:03:59,183 --> 01:04:02,055
...I want to talk to you
about some work stuff.

1427
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:03,622
Hi.

1428
01:04:04,884 --> 01:04:06,451
- Hey.
- Hey.

1429
01:04:06,494 --> 01:04:09,280
I heard you were at your, uh,
dad's office again today.

1430
01:04:09,323 --> 01:04:11,673
Yeah.
It's nice in there, you know?

1431
01:04:11,717 --> 01:04:13,893
- Quiet.
- Good.

1432
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:16,591
Well, should we take a trip
around the old boardwalk?

1433
01:04:16,635 --> 01:04:18,898
Yeah. Let's do that.
Jesse?

1434
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:21,161
- Sounds good to me.
- It'll be fun.

1435
01:04:22,423 --> 01:04:24,469
Oh.
I'll get that.

1436
01:04:25,992 --> 01:04:28,125
Hey!
Becky, nice to see you.

1437
01:04:28,168 --> 01:04:29,474
Thank you.

1438
01:04:29,517 --> 01:04:31,911
Is Shawn here?
I stopped by the office.

1439
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:34,044
- Hi, Becky.
- Hi, Shawn.

1440
01:04:34,087 --> 01:04:35,567
I just finished filing
your taxes.

1441
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:37,264
Well, I appreciate that.

1442
01:04:37,308 --> 01:04:39,614
That's actually why I'm here...
To properly thank you.

1443
01:04:39,658 --> 01:04:42,052
- Aww.
- I made you...

1444
01:04:42,095 --> 01:04:44,750
And your family, of course...
This Christmas cake.

1445
01:04:46,447 --> 01:04:49,146
- It's still a little warm.
- Wow.

1446
01:04:49,189 --> 01:04:51,888
And probably... sticky
on the inside.

1447
01:04:53,324 --> 01:04:55,761
Well, that's my favorite.

1448
01:04:55,804 --> 01:04:59,025
Well... looks
and it smells great.

1449
01:04:59,069 --> 01:05:01,071
Hey, you're not in too big
of a rush, are you?

1450
01:05:01,114 --> 01:05:03,856
We were just about to sit down
and, uh, play some 'Nopoly.

1451
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,989
No.
No rush here.

1452
01:05:06,032 --> 01:05:07,642
- I love 'Nopoly.
- You do?

1453
01:05:07,686 --> 01:05:08,643
I do.

1454
01:05:08,687 --> 01:05:10,950
- Come on in.
- I'd love to.

1455
01:05:12,299 --> 01:05:14,301
Mm.

1456
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:20,612
Mm!

1457
01:05:21,178 --> 01:05:22,657
Oh, darn!

1458
01:05:22,701 --> 01:05:25,443
And that is going to cost you
1,500 big'uns.

1459
01:05:25,486 --> 01:05:27,097
- Oops.
- Oh. Sh...

1460
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:29,534
Yep.
I am cleaned out.

1461
01:05:29,577 --> 01:05:31,492
- I'll lend you some money.
- Hey! No.

1462
01:05:31,536 --> 01:05:33,233
That ain't how it works, hoss.

1463
01:05:33,277 --> 01:05:35,627
Uh, sorry.
You're done.

1464
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:37,890
- Damn.
- All right.

1465
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,458
- Becky, your turn.
- It's at me. It's coming at me.

1466
01:05:40,501 --> 01:05:44,114
And remember, all of Jesse's
hotels are now up for auction.

1467
01:05:44,157 --> 01:05:46,159
- I have a proposition for you.
- Oh.

1468
01:05:46,203 --> 01:05:49,902
Would you like to trade me
Pacific Avenue for Vermont?

1469
01:05:51,338 --> 01:05:52,644
- Yes.
- Really?

1470
01:05:52,687 --> 01:05:54,733
- Yes. This works out well...
- Okay.

1471
01:05:54,776 --> 01:05:56,691
- Goodness me.
- ...for all parties involved.

1472
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,476
All parties are happy.

1473
01:05:58,519 --> 01:05:59,912
Some wonderful side action.

1474
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,566
- David, it is your roll.
- Great.

1475
01:06:01,609 --> 01:06:03,524
But snake eyes will cost you
everything you've got.

1476
01:06:03,568 --> 01:06:05,135
- Oh, they will.
- Be careful.

1477
01:06:05,178 --> 01:06:06,745
- No pressure.
- No snake eyes. Here we go.

1478
01:06:06,788 --> 01:06:08,573
- I say yes pressure.
- Okay. Lucky roll.

1479
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:10,662
- Aah!
- Oh, no!

1480
01:06:10,705 --> 01:06:12,533
You're outta there!

1481
01:06:12,577 --> 01:06:16,015
Pack up your shit
and get outta here!

1482
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:17,886
Oh, that's a bummer.
All right.

1483
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:20,063
Well, that was fun.
That was a lot of fun.

1484
01:06:20,106 --> 01:06:21,586
Indeedily. Okay.

1485
01:06:21,629 --> 01:06:26,112
Well, looks like there are
just two people left

1486
01:06:26,156 --> 01:06:27,505
playing 'Nopoly.

1487
01:06:27,548 --> 01:06:28,854
Berkshire Hathaway?

1488
01:06:28,897 --> 01:06:30,464
Ooh.
You scared?

1489
01:06:30,508 --> 01:06:32,249
I'm not sure I am.

1490
01:06:32,292 --> 01:06:35,165
I can't remember the last time
I actually lost at that game.

1491
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:36,601
You're a formidable opponent.

1492
01:06:36,644 --> 01:06:38,211
You too.

1493
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:40,909
- Bye, Shawn.
- Night, Becky.

1494
01:06:40,953 --> 01:06:42,868
- Bye, Becky!
- Bye!

1495
01:06:44,391 --> 01:06:46,176
Oh.
Well, tomorrow is a big day.

1496
01:06:46,219 --> 01:06:49,135
So when your dad comes down
from the roof,

1497
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:50,963
tell him that I'm going to bed.

1498
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,008
Okay.

1499
01:06:52,051 --> 01:06:53,183
Good night, Shawn.

1500
01:06:53,226 --> 01:06:54,967
I'm so glad you made it home.

1501
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,795
Me too.
Night, Mama.

1502
01:06:56,838 --> 01:06:58,362
- Good night, Aunt Liz.
- Good night.

1503
01:06:58,405 --> 01:06:59,841
Good night, you two.

1504
01:06:59,885 --> 01:07:01,800
Gonna see if Uncle Rob
needs a hand on the roof.

1505
01:07:01,843 --> 01:07:03,193
Perfect.

1506
01:07:03,236 --> 01:07:04,716
So, Jesse...

1507
01:07:04,759 --> 01:07:06,761
So, did you want a slice of cake

1508
01:07:06,805 --> 01:07:09,460
or maybe want to just sneak up
to the bedroom

1509
01:07:09,503 --> 01:07:12,593
and get something straight
between us?

1510
01:07:12,637 --> 01:07:14,204
Oh. Uh...

1511
01:07:14,247 --> 01:07:15,596
Actually, I'm kind of tired,

1512
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,294
and, um, it's gonna be
a big day tomorrow,

1513
01:07:17,337 --> 01:07:20,645
with the party and everything,
so I'm just gonna turn in.

1514
01:07:20,688 --> 01:07:21,689
Okay.

1515
01:07:21,733 --> 01:07:23,126
Well, if I was hanging out,

1516
01:07:23,169 --> 01:07:25,824
it might help you sleep
a little bit better.

1517
01:07:25,867 --> 01:07:28,566
I'm sure it would, but, um,
we'll just talk tomorrow.

1518
01:07:28,609 --> 01:07:30,350
- Mm-kay.
- Okay?

1519
01:07:31,525 --> 01:07:33,223
Sounds like a plan.

1520
01:07:33,266 --> 01:07:35,660
- Good night!
- Good night.

1521
01:07:44,538 --> 01:07:45,887
Hey, Uncle Rob.

1522
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,022
One more night,
and then it's showtime.

1523
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,198
Oh, boy.
You need a hand here?

1524
01:07:52,242 --> 01:07:54,418
Yeah. These bulbs
are giving me a problem.

1525
01:07:54,461 --> 01:07:56,550
Oh, I got it.
You've done enough.

1526
01:07:56,594 --> 01:07:58,987
You're damn right I have.

1527
01:07:59,031 --> 01:08:02,034
I've footed the bill
for this entire holiday.

1528
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:05,168
And the way my wife cooks,
that's not exactly cheap.

1529
01:08:05,994 --> 01:08:10,129
Hell, I-I could've taken
a solo Disney cruise.

1530
01:08:10,173 --> 01:08:12,740
- Ah, next year.
- Yeah.

1531
01:08:12,784 --> 01:08:14,612
Well, we'll see you in the...
Oh, hey, Shawn.

1532
01:08:14,655 --> 01:08:16,135
- Hey.
- All right.

1533
01:08:16,179 --> 01:08:17,528
- Sleep tight, big dog.
- Good night, buddy.

1534
01:08:17,571 --> 01:08:19,095
Thank you, sir.

1535
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:21,358
Wow.

1536
01:08:21,401 --> 01:08:23,055
Not bad.
You need a hand with this stuff?

1537
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,362
Oh, no. That's...
That's okay. I got it.

1538
01:08:25,404 --> 01:08:27,537
Okay.
Cool.

1539
01:08:27,581 --> 01:08:31,411
So, uh, you talk to Jesse about
taking those photos for you yet?

1540
01:08:31,455 --> 01:08:32,934
No.
No, not yet.

1541
01:08:32,978 --> 01:08:34,413
Good.
Yeah. I wouldn't.

1542
01:08:34,457 --> 01:08:36,938
I'm, uh, actually
starting to think about

1543
01:08:36,982 --> 01:08:40,464
maybe making a run with her
long term here in Ketchum.

1544
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,379
Really?

1545
01:08:42,421 --> 01:08:44,729
Plus I got the family business
I could fall into

1546
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:45,991
with Pop-peroni.

1547
01:08:46,033 --> 01:08:47,340
It's the perfect parachute!

1548
01:08:47,384 --> 01:08:48,907
You know what I'm talking about?

1549
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:51,170
Rather than just being a number
in the city,

1550
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:52,867
make a name for myself
here in Ketchum.

1551
01:08:52,911 --> 01:08:55,218
- Mm.
- Could be a good life.

1552
01:08:55,261 --> 01:08:57,524
I mean, she loves Ketchum,
you know?

1553
01:08:57,568 --> 01:09:00,353
Plus, I think she'd be
a really good stay-at-home mom.

1554
01:09:00,397 --> 01:09:01,832
Right.

1555
01:09:01,876 --> 01:09:03,529
I mean, she loves the scenery.
Look around.

1556
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:05,270
- We've got all these mountains.
- Beautiful.

1557
01:09:05,314 --> 01:09:06,925
She could take photos
of all this shit.

1558
01:09:06,968 --> 01:09:08,318
- Fresh air. The smells.
- She could stay sharp

1559
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:12,582
by, uh, taking photos
of our s-s-sessions.

1560
01:09:12,626 --> 01:09:14,323
- What type of sessions?
- Sex.

1561
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,934
- Okay. Oh, I see.
- Yeah.

1562
01:09:15,977 --> 01:09:18,979
Nothing on a hard drive.
I don't want any, you know...

1563
01:09:19,024 --> 01:09:20,546
evidence.

1564
01:09:20,591 --> 01:09:23,506
Have you talked to Jesse
about this?

1565
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:25,639
Dude, uh, I broke up with her,

1566
01:09:25,683 --> 01:09:28,207
and she's here spending
Christmas with my family.

1567
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:30,818
I think it's a "yes" from her.

1568
01:09:30,862 --> 01:09:33,908
All right.
Well, good luck.

1569
01:09:33,952 --> 01:09:36,215
You, uh, sure you got all that?

1570
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:37,477
Uh, yeah. No. I'm good.

1571
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,870
- I got it.
- All right. Cool.

1572
01:09:38,912 --> 01:09:42,265
Hey, uh, big night tomorrow.
Party.

1573
01:09:42,308 --> 01:09:44,528
- Yep. Can't wait.
- Light show.

1574
01:09:44,571 --> 01:09:46,573
Can't wait.

1575
01:09:59,717 --> 01:10:02,023
All right.
No toothpicks.

1576
01:10:02,067 --> 01:10:04,896
And we need more of these.

1577
01:10:04,939 --> 01:10:05,984
- Oh.
- Oh.

1578
01:10:06,027 --> 01:10:07,681
- Hey.
- Hey! Hi.

1579
01:10:07,725 --> 01:10:09,727
I'm actually starting to enjoy
bumping into you like this.

1580
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:11,163
- Hm.
- Um...

1581
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,253
- Where's Polo?
- Oh, he's upstairs.

1582
01:10:14,297 --> 01:10:16,821
Just, uh, trying to keep him
away from all this temptation.

1583
01:10:16,864 --> 01:10:19,127
Mm-hmm.

1584
01:10:19,171 --> 01:10:20,781
- It's a pretty great turnout.
- Oh, yeah.

1585
01:10:20,825 --> 01:10:22,305
- Yeah.
- It sure is.

1586
01:10:22,348 --> 01:10:25,308
Do you want a...
Mrs. C's Cheese Puff?

1587
01:10:25,351 --> 01:10:27,397
Um, it's a new recipe.
I think she really nailed it.

1588
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,616
Who knew mayonnaise and bacon
would go on in cheese puff?

1589
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:30,878
I didn't.

1590
01:10:30,922 --> 01:10:33,141
There's one left.
Do you want it?

1591
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:36,362
No, thank you.
I'm... I'm good. Thank you.

1592
01:10:36,406 --> 01:10:38,582
Hey, um...

1593
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:40,540
- is everything okay?
- Yeah.

1594
01:10:40,584 --> 01:10:43,804
Just, uh, cheese balls weren't
on the menu for me tonight.

1595
01:10:44,631 --> 01:10:48,287
If something is bothering you,
then it's better to just say it,

1596
01:10:48,331 --> 01:10:50,463
you know... than not.

1597
01:10:57,862 --> 01:11:00,908
Hi, everyone.
Uh, merry Christmas.

1598
01:11:00,952 --> 01:11:04,434
Uh, could I have your attention
for a moment now?

1599
01:11:04,477 --> 01:11:06,653
Oh, thank you, Liz.

1600
01:11:06,697 --> 01:11:08,655
I've got an announcement
to make, please.

1601
01:11:08,699 --> 01:11:11,702
Uh, starting in the new year,

1602
01:11:11,745 --> 01:11:16,141
Campbell Accounting is going to
acquire a brand-new partner.

1603
01:11:16,184 --> 01:11:18,709
And I think he'll be able
to cook your books

1604
01:11:18,752 --> 01:11:21,320
just as well as I have
over all these years.

1605
01:11:22,669 --> 01:11:27,718
And his name
is Mr. Shawn Campbell!

1606
01:11:27,761 --> 01:11:30,068
Well, that's myname.
That's weird!

1607
01:11:30,111 --> 01:11:32,331
Yes. Thank you, Dad.

1608
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,898
Uh, good to be a partner.

1609
01:11:33,941 --> 01:11:36,944
And, uh, you know, I'm gonna
cook them the best I can.

1610
01:11:36,988 --> 01:11:39,773
Let's take the government
for everything it's got, okay?

1611
01:11:40,513 --> 01:11:43,124
But really,
let's all get superfucked up.

1612
01:11:43,168 --> 01:11:45,518
Leave your keys in the bowl

1613
01:11:45,562 --> 01:11:47,390
and your inhibitions
in the backyard.

1614
01:11:47,433 --> 01:11:50,654
Let's do this up and celebrate.
Merry merry!

1615
01:11:50,697 --> 01:11:53,831
Yes!

1616
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:11,631
- Jesse. Hey.
- Hey.

1617
01:12:11,675 --> 01:12:13,546
I was trying to connect with you
to give you the news myself,

1618
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:16,027
but, you know,
the old man just got so excited.

1619
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:17,289
He looked over the moon.

1620
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:18,943
I mean, you've made him
very proud.

1621
01:12:18,986 --> 01:12:21,119
I didn't plan on any of this,
but since I got home,

1622
01:12:21,162 --> 01:12:23,164
it's just felt so right,
you know?

1623
01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:25,079
I'm very happy for you.

1624
01:12:25,123 --> 01:12:28,474
Well, I mean, the plan is for us
to be happy together.

1625
01:12:28,518 --> 01:12:30,911
Look, you love Ketchum,
and you love my family.

1626
01:12:30,955 --> 01:12:32,739
And then the partnership
with my dad,

1627
01:12:32,783 --> 01:12:34,567
and everything's just...
falling into place.

1628
01:12:34,611 --> 01:12:35,960
It's like...
Like it's meant to be.

1629
01:12:36,003 --> 01:12:37,527
Yeah. I... I guess.

1630
01:12:37,570 --> 01:12:39,267
- Look...
- I mean...

1631
01:12:39,311 --> 01:12:41,226
...I don't want to rush
this moment too much, but...

1632
01:12:41,269 --> 01:12:42,662
I do want to get
to the good stuff,

1633
01:12:42,706 --> 01:12:45,361
by which I mean
me having sex a-with you.

1634
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:46,927
You know?

1635
01:12:46,971 --> 01:12:49,321
Look, I want you in every room
in this house.

1636
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,454
Oh. Uh, there's a lot of rooms
in this house.

1637
01:12:51,497 --> 01:12:53,543
Doesn't that sound wonderful?

1638
01:12:53,586 --> 01:12:55,327
Do you feel what's going on
there?

1639
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:56,589
I do.

1640
01:12:57,198 --> 01:12:58,461
Mm-hmm.

1641
01:12:58,504 --> 01:13:01,202
That is about as hard
as a penis gets.

1642
01:13:02,595 --> 01:13:04,031
I'm throbbing.

1643
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:16,522
Oh!
Uh, okay.

1644
01:13:16,566 --> 01:13:17,958
I, um... Wow.

1645
01:13:18,002 --> 01:13:21,484
I-I just need, um, a second
to... to process.

1646
01:13:21,527 --> 01:13:23,355
This is all happening very fast.

1647
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,096
Yeah. Okay. I get it.
Think about it.

1648
01:13:25,139 --> 01:13:27,011
And while you're doing that,
maybe we could, uh,

1649
01:13:27,054 --> 01:13:28,621
process this hard-on, you know?

1650
01:13:28,665 --> 01:13:30,275
We made it together, after all.

1651
01:13:30,318 --> 01:13:33,757
I just need, like, a little time
to... to think about it...

1652
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,541
- Um... yeah.
- ...for a second.

1653
01:13:35,585 --> 01:13:37,804
All right. Well, don't think
about it too much.

1654
01:13:37,848 --> 01:13:41,112
I mean, I got sub-10% body fat
and, uh, my own business.

1655
01:13:41,155 --> 01:13:43,288
So... a lot of options.

1656
01:13:44,637 --> 01:13:46,770
Oh, I think it's time
for the light show.

1657
01:13:47,988 --> 01:13:50,643
All right, everyone.

1658
01:13:50,687 --> 01:13:54,299
Lizzie and I are thrilled
to once again be sharing

1659
01:13:54,342 --> 01:13:56,736
this most special time
of the year

1660
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:59,957
with all of you,
our family and friends.

1661
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,262
Give 'er the business, Rob!

1662
01:14:01,306 --> 01:14:02,873
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1663
01:14:02,916 --> 01:14:05,615
- Lizzie, the honors, please.
- Mm-hmm.

1664
01:14:32,642 --> 01:14:34,948
I know, buddy.
Just you and me.

1665
01:14:42,565 --> 01:14:45,655
Mmm!

1666
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:11,985
- Morning.
- Morning, sunshine.

1667
01:15:12,029 --> 01:15:14,248
Oh, no.
I'm okay.

1668
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:16,381
A little early in the morning
for me, but thank you.

1669
01:15:16,424 --> 01:15:18,644
No worries.
I'm just having fun.

1670
01:15:18,688 --> 01:15:20,864
It's the holidays.

1671
01:15:20,907 --> 01:15:23,649
Might have a tall boy
with lunch.

1672
01:15:24,781 --> 01:15:26,347
So...

1673
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:31,527
...Shawn had some pretty
exciting news last night.

1674
01:15:32,266 --> 01:15:33,572
Yeah.
Yeah, he sure did.

1675
01:15:33,616 --> 01:15:35,356
Well, I am not surprised

1676
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:39,056
that he decided to work with his
father and start a life here.

1677
01:15:39,099 --> 01:15:40,361
Mm.

1678
01:15:40,405 --> 01:15:42,276
Do you remember
that magical metaphor

1679
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,322
I told you about before?

1680
01:15:44,365 --> 01:15:47,934
About taking the path
less traveled?

1681
01:15:47,978 --> 01:15:51,590
Mm. Mm-hmm.
Like the Robert Frost metaphor.

1682
01:15:51,634 --> 01:15:52,896
Who's that?

1683
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:55,942
Robert Frost.
The poet.

1684
01:15:56,769 --> 01:16:00,251
Well, I'm not talking
about poems, Jesse.

1685
01:16:00,294 --> 01:16:02,645
I am talking about life.

1686
01:16:03,254 --> 01:16:05,865
- Mm.
- And sometimes in life,

1687
01:16:05,909 --> 01:16:07,867
there's a fork in the road.

1688
01:16:09,042 --> 01:16:12,263
Yeah. Yeah, I think he was
talking about that as well.

1689
01:16:13,177 --> 01:16:17,050
Well, for me,
as it applied to mylife,

1690
01:16:17,094 --> 01:16:21,272
I could either take the path
that was safe and established,

1691
01:16:21,315 --> 01:16:25,276
or I could take the one
that was less traveled,

1692
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:28,366
the one that was following
my heart.

1693
01:16:29,323 --> 01:16:32,631
And for me,
that made all the difference.

1694
01:16:36,679 --> 01:16:38,158
And I want you to know...

1695
01:16:38,985 --> 01:16:42,859
...that whichever path you take,
I support it.

1696
01:16:45,078 --> 01:16:46,602
Thank you, Mrs. C.

1697
01:16:46,645 --> 01:16:47,864
That means a lot.

1698
01:16:47,907 --> 01:16:50,431
Come here, Jesse.

1699
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:00,311
Ah! Perfect.

1700
01:17:00,354 --> 01:17:03,227
I have been trying to get inside
those wee little underpants

1701
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:04,576
all day.

1702
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:06,273
- Shawn... S-Shawn...
- Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba...

1703
01:17:06,317 --> 01:17:08,406
Hey, hey.
Can I... Can I... Can... Hey.

1704
01:17:08,449 --> 01:17:10,626
Can you just let me talk?
Shawn?

1705
01:17:10,669 --> 01:17:11,931
- What?
- Can I just have a minute?

1706
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:14,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll talk. We'll talk.

1707
01:17:14,064 --> 01:17:16,501
Good idea. We'll connect
mentally, you know?

1708
01:17:16,544 --> 01:17:19,635
Get a good intimacy lather
going,

1709
01:17:19,678 --> 01:17:22,376
nice and soapy,
before we get to the good stuff.

1710
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:23,682
I get it. Yeah. Yeah.
Let's do it.

1711
01:17:23,726 --> 01:17:25,684
Let's preheat the oven.

1712
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:29,209
Let's, um, breathe deep and, uh,
make that connection happen.

1713
01:17:29,253 --> 01:17:30,907
I'm all ears.
What do you want to... Oh!

1714
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:33,474
This ought to light your wick.

1715
01:17:33,518 --> 01:17:37,087
How about we talk about...

1716
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:39,611
what color we can paint
the baby's room?

1717
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,613
I'm thinking maybe an aqua
until we...

1718
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,963
- Shawn.
- ...reveal the gender.

1719
01:17:44,007 --> 01:17:45,704
- Uh-huh.
- Honestly...

1720
01:17:45,748 --> 01:17:48,533
I do not want to move forward
and start a life with you.

1721
01:17:50,883 --> 01:17:52,493
Wait.
What are you talking about?

1722
01:17:52,537 --> 01:17:54,626
Shawn, when you broke up
with me...

1723
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:56,628
- Uh-huh.
- ...you told me that one day

1724
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,325
I would look back
and I would realize

1725
01:17:58,369 --> 01:18:00,414
that us going our separate ways
was for the best.

1726
01:18:00,458 --> 01:18:02,155
- And you were right.
- Isaid that?

1727
01:18:02,199 --> 01:18:03,374
No. Jesse...

1728
01:18:03,417 --> 01:18:04,767
We're very different.

1729
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:07,073
We're different,
and we like different things.

1730
01:18:07,117 --> 01:18:12,557
You like playing 'Nopoly,
and everything is a competition.

1731
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:17,693
And I like... I don't know...
Taking pictures of flowers.

1732
01:18:17,736 --> 01:18:21,435
And I don't run everything
through a filter

1733
01:18:21,479 --> 01:18:24,177
of "How can I brand this
and make money?"

1734
01:18:24,221 --> 01:18:25,657
Yeah. I never understood that
about you.

1735
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,573
And you're gonna be here,
working with your dad

1736
01:18:28,616 --> 01:18:30,749
and... and being
with your family.

1737
01:18:30,793 --> 01:18:34,535
And I'm...
I'm so excited for you.

1738
01:18:34,579 --> 01:18:37,669
But that's the right
next chapter for yourlife.

1739
01:18:38,888 --> 01:18:40,063
But it's not mine.

1740
01:18:43,806 --> 01:18:47,418
Yeah. I knew my words would
come back to bite me in the ass.

1741
01:18:48,288 --> 01:18:50,769
I guess this means
you'll be taking that job

1742
01:18:50,813 --> 01:18:52,597
working with David.

1743
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,425
What job working with David?

1744
01:18:54,468 --> 01:18:56,949
The job taking pictures.

1745
01:18:57,863 --> 01:18:59,691
David wants us to work together?

1746
01:19:00,213 --> 01:19:03,042
Ye...
Ooh. Whoops.

1747
01:19:03,086 --> 01:19:05,001
Maybe I wasn't supposed to say
anything.

1748
01:19:05,044 --> 01:19:06,785
Uh, sorry.

1749
01:19:06,829 --> 01:19:09,614
I just assumed that you not
wanting to move forward with me

1750
01:19:09,657 --> 01:19:10,833
was because of him.

1751
01:19:10,876 --> 01:19:13,574
Um...

1752
01:19:13,618 --> 01:19:15,098
And I'm not stupid, Jesse.

1753
01:19:15,141 --> 01:19:17,187
I can see how well
you two get along

1754
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:19,972
and have all kinds of stuff
in common.

1755
01:19:20,016 --> 01:19:21,408
And...

1756
01:19:21,452 --> 01:19:24,281
And the truth is,
he's a really great guy.

1757
01:19:24,324 --> 01:19:25,761
Very poor, but a great guy.

1758
01:19:46,999 --> 01:19:48,653
I'm sorry.

1759
01:19:48,696 --> 01:19:51,787
I'm not gonna make Christmas
after all.

1760
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:53,440
Happy holidays.

1761
01:20:17,638 --> 01:20:19,162
Got the supplies, Polo.

1762
01:20:19,205 --> 01:20:21,338
Next stop... Boise.

1763
01:20:31,652 --> 01:20:33,393
♪ It's a quarter after 1:00 ♪

1764
01:20:33,437 --> 01:20:35,265
♪ I'm all alone,

1765
01:20:35,308 --> 01:20:38,007
Quiet! What's the matter?

1766
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:39,791
Oh, buddy, come on.

1767
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,663
You should have gone
before we left.

1768
01:20:42,707 --> 01:20:43,969
Man.

1769
01:20:44,013 --> 01:20:45,188
Get out here.

1770
01:20:45,231 --> 01:20:46,885
All right.
Make it quick, buddy.

1771
01:20:46,929 --> 01:20:50,193
Not... Not too far, now!

1772
01:20:51,759 --> 01:20:54,588
Polo! Hey!
Not...

1773
01:20:54,632 --> 01:20:56,068
Damn it.

1774
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:57,853
Polo!

1775
01:21:17,611 --> 01:21:20,745
I guess some wishes just expire.

1776
01:21:27,143 --> 01:21:28,318
Polo?

1777
01:21:29,406 --> 01:21:32,365
Polo, come here!

1778
01:21:32,409 --> 01:21:35,281
- Hi! What are you doing here?
- Hey! Polo!

1779
01:21:35,325 --> 01:21:36,239
Oh.

1780
01:21:36,282 --> 01:21:39,198
Po... Oh, man.

1781
01:21:41,418 --> 01:21:42,288
Hey.

1782
01:21:42,332 --> 01:21:44,203
Hey.

1783
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:47,424
Polo ran off.

1784
01:21:47,467 --> 01:21:50,340
Thought he was chasing
a squirrel.

1785
01:21:50,383 --> 01:21:51,428
David, listen.

1786
01:21:51,471 --> 01:21:55,171
Um... I need to tell you this.

1787
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,263
When Shawn walked through
that door, my...

1788
01:22:00,306 --> 01:22:02,047
my heart wasn't happy
to see him.

1789
01:22:02,091 --> 01:22:03,614
Obviously, your lips were.

1790
01:22:05,137 --> 01:22:07,270
What are you talking about?

1791
01:22:07,313 --> 01:22:09,272
Jesse, come on.

1792
01:22:09,315 --> 01:22:11,796
Don't make me say it.

1793
01:22:11,839 --> 01:22:14,451
I saw you two kissing
last night.

1794
01:22:14,494 --> 01:22:16,235
Okay.
That's why you left.

1795
01:22:16,279 --> 01:22:20,109
David, you saw him kiss me.
But I wasn't kissing him back.

1796
01:22:20,152 --> 01:22:22,459
- Hey, Jesse, don't stand here...
- No. David...

1797
01:22:22,502 --> 01:22:23,982
David, listen to me.

1798
01:22:24,026 --> 01:22:26,071
When I first got here,
I was very confused,

1799
01:22:26,115 --> 01:22:28,987
and... and Shawn came home,
and he was all... horned up,

1800
01:22:29,031 --> 01:22:30,336
and I actually felt
really guilty

1801
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:31,685
about being here
in the first place.

1802
01:22:31,729 --> 01:22:34,079
But ultimately, it...

1803
01:22:34,775 --> 01:22:37,126
...it reaffirmed
what my heart already knew.

1804
01:22:39,041 --> 01:22:41,217
That I was falling in love
with you.

1805
01:22:43,436 --> 01:22:48,659
Just a few short days ago, I was
standing in front of this tree,

1806
01:22:48,702 --> 01:22:50,922
and I made a Christmas wish.

1807
01:22:52,184 --> 01:22:55,666
And I'm kind of hoping
it still comes true.

1808
01:22:57,929 --> 01:22:59,975
Well, that's funny.

1809
01:23:01,585 --> 01:23:03,717
'Cause I made a wish too.

1810
01:23:14,076 --> 01:23:16,121
I think that was it.

1811
01:23:17,122 --> 01:23:19,211
All right.
I'll see you later.

1812
01:23:22,171 --> 01:23:24,303
I'm just kidding. Come here.

1813
01:23:29,526 --> 01:23:33,704

01:23:43,366 --> 01:23:47,239
We know what that
beaver hound's after.

1818
01:23:48,371 --> 01:23:49,589
Wow.

1819
01:23:49,633 --> 01:23:54,681
Look at you, coming inside...
my shop.

1820
01:23:54,725 --> 01:23:58,685
Well, I decided that I would,
and... I never pull out.

1821
01:23:59,382 --> 01:24:00,861
So here I am.

1822
01:24:00,905 --> 01:24:04,909
And good golly,
it is warm and tight in here.

1823
01:24:04,952 --> 01:24:09,914
Hopefully it still...
smells fresh as well

1824
01:24:09,957 --> 01:24:11,307
this late in the afternoon.

1825
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:13,265
Never fresher.

1826
01:24:13,309 --> 01:24:16,181
And I already know the taste
is out of this world.

1827
01:24:16,225 --> 01:24:20,055
Did you come by
for a little Taste Good?

1828
01:24:21,317 --> 01:24:23,275
No. I had something in mind
that might last...

1829
01:24:23,319 --> 01:24:25,451
a little bit longer than that.

1830
01:24:25,495 --> 01:24:29,629
You dodged a bullet, Darlene.

1831
01:24:29,673 --> 01:24:32,371

getting a peek

1832
