1
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:12,180
[ Bird screeching. Loud ]

2
00:02:16,648 --> 00:02:17,509
Shush.

3
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:19,821
Polly.

4
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:30,035
Sahib Wales.

5
00:02:30,854 --> 00:02:32,755
You should not have come.

6
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,478
In this room.

7
00:02:36,627 --> 00:02:37,580
My dear man.

8
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,048
Ramdaz.

9
00:02:40,674 --> 00:02:42,638
Here is ten rupees.

10
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:46,118
It is yours.

11
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:51,163
If you leave me alone in
this room for ten minutes.

12
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:52,883
No.

13
00:02:53,888 --> 00:02:55,105
Maybe the commissioner ..

14
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:57,227
Will blame me. Ramdaz.

15
00:02:58,252 --> 00:03:03,070
I am more interested in finding
out who murdered your master ..

16
00:03:03,582 --> 00:03:04,575
Than the police.

17
00:03:04,895 --> 00:03:06,828
The commissioner say to me: 'Ramdaz'.

18
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:09,484
'Everything stay same here'.

19
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,949
'Until the chief inspector, he come'.

20
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,330
Stand over there.

21
00:03:21,355 --> 00:03:22,604
Stand there.

22
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:29,746
Sit down.

23
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,602
A stupid mess.

24
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:36,136
Stupid.

25
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:39,442
Ramdaz.

26
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,404
I say, can't you understand ..

27
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,494
Now listen.

28
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,032
I'll give you 20 rupees, 30 rupees.

29
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:50,871
Will you do what I ask?

30
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:53,222
Will you please do what I ask of you?

31
00:04:01,748 --> 00:04:04,246
Ramdaz, I could strangle you.

32
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:15,408
I say.

33
00:04:15,836 --> 00:04:17,662
I say, Commissioner Grimshaw.
Are you there?

34
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,047
Mr Wales, I am thoroughly exasperated.

35
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:23,894
You have not only disobeyed police
orders but you're becoming a pest.

36
00:04:24,278 --> 00:04:24,950
I see.

37
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:26,365
See here.

38
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:28,672
Hang it all.

39
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:32,075
Listen.

40
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:38,814
I am positive that I can identify
the woman who killed Spencer Lee.

41
00:04:39,998 --> 00:04:40,985
Explain yourself.

42
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:45,529
No. It would be most unwise
to mention her name.

43
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,845
You see. She is very highly connected.

44
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:51,542
In official circles.

45
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:53,513
Careful, Mr Wales.

46
00:04:54,157 --> 00:04:55,688
You're treading on dangerous ground.

47
00:04:56,581 --> 00:04:58,627
It is best that you wait there.
We'll be right along.

48
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:02,696
Delzante. This man Wales is insane.

49
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,981
Now he intimates it was a woman.

50
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:07,144
Highly connected in official circles.

51
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:16,260
Highly connected in official circles?

52
00:05:21,508 --> 00:05:22,552
These records show.

53
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:25,603
That this woman was heavily veiled.

54
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,574
Tommy-rot. All Tommy-rot.

55
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:31,176
Most of Spencer Lee's women
callers were heavily veiled.

56
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:33,607
Most of them, married women.

57
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:37,127
Yet, immediately after her departure ..

58
00:05:38,011 --> 00:05:40,122
The crime was discovered.

59
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,346
Yes. Edward Wales arrived at the house
just as the woman was leaving.

60
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:46,171
He found Lee on the floor with
a knife wound in his back.

61
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:48,793
He died in Wales' arms.
Without speaking.

62
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:53,820
Let us be moving along.

63
00:05:54,344 --> 00:05:55,817
I would like to speak with this ..

64
00:05:56,116 --> 00:05:57,867
Mr Wales.
- Just a moment please.

65
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:01,764
Get me Sir Roscoe Crosby
at the residency.

66
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,682
You found no fingerprints of this woman?
- No.

67
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,511
Although tea had been served
her cup had not been touched.

68
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:11,026
Sir Roscoe?

69
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,059
This is Commissioner Grimshaw.

70
00:06:13,686 --> 00:06:14,930
I wish to advise you, sir.

71
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:18,426
That Inspector Delzante of the
Criminal Investigation department.

72
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,330
Arrived in Calcutta this afternoon
and sends his respect, sir.

73
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:22,948
Thank him, Grimshaw.

74
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:27,182
And assure him that my office is at his
service for any assistance he requires.

75
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,519
Here. You have missed one.
- So I have.

76
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:32,564
A very good one too.
- Rather.

77
00:06:33,475 --> 00:06:34,491
That was Grimshaw.

78
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:39,071
Inspector Delzante of the Criminal
Investigation Department has arrived.

79
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,339
Sir Roscoe.

80
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:43,648
I know I am wrong, and I just
cannot explain my feelings.

81
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:45,943
But at times I find myself hoping.

82
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:48,399
I hope they never find the culprit.

83
00:06:48,837 --> 00:06:49,954
Come, my dear.

84
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:52,096
I admit he was a bit of a rotter.

85
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:54,169
But you mustn't feel that way.

86
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:56,694
Father, now please
don't start preaching.

87
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,866
Mother wasn't thinking
of Spencer's morals.

88
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:00,766
Were you, darling?
- No.

89
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,597
I was thinking of the woman.

90
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:04,333
And Roscoe.

91
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:07,595
I have a feeling that it
was that veiled woman.

92
00:07:08,822 --> 00:07:10,428
And I dread learning who she is.

93
00:07:10,757 --> 00:07:11,782
Nellie O'Neill.

94
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:14,982
I say.

95
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,012
Do you think something could be wrong?

96
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:18,479
Nellie.

97
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:21,992
Nellie, wait a minute. Please.

98
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:27,089
Nellie O'Neill.

99
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:32,420
You know, you are stubborn.

100
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:34,906
You are just plain stubborn.

101
00:07:36,492 --> 00:07:37,324
Richard.

102
00:07:38,072 --> 00:07:40,630
When a woman loves a man
as much as I love you ..

103
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:42,825
It is hard to say 'no'.

104
00:07:43,558 --> 00:07:44,887
Nellie, I don't want you to.

105
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:48,027
There's nothing that would make me
happier than to marry you, but ..

106
00:07:48,728 --> 00:07:49,457
I can't.

107
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:51,043
What is it then, dear?

108
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,614
Everything.

109
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,227
Do you realize you don't even
know who I am or what I am?

110
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,406
Nonsense, darling. I don't care.

111
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,928
Don't you see, dear?

112
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,456
There is a great difference between us.

113
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:07,964
So that's the bee in your bonnet.

114
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:13,540
You think because you're my mother's
secretary that you shouldn't marry me.

115
00:08:15,178 --> 00:08:16,222
Nellie, look at me.

116
00:08:17,784 --> 00:08:18,485
Nellie.

117
00:08:20,895 --> 00:08:22,731
That can't make any
difference to us, dear.

118
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,576
It never will make a difference.

119
00:08:25,065 --> 00:08:27,598
You don't seem to understand.
- Darling, don't be silly.

120
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:31,587
You come along with me and
we'll settle that once and for all.

121
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,246
Do as I say. Come along.

122
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:36,745
Nellie is a brick, and I shall
jolly well cherish her as a sister.

123
00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:41,080
I suppose we shall have to be
reconciled to Richard's choice.

124
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,898
After all, it's really his wedding.

125
00:08:45,478 --> 00:08:46,465
Well, rather.

126
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,110
Roscoe, you're an old dear.

127
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,416
Top hole, Richard.

128
00:08:49,777 --> 00:08:51,536
The family sanctions
your choice of a wife.

129
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:55,274
Thanks, Helen. Awfully nice of you but I
feel you put the cart before the horse.

130
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:56,850
What do you mean, Richard?

131
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:58,384
Mother.
- What is it?

132
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:00,508
Nellie is all fussed-up
because we've got money.

133
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:02,885
She thinks that I am ..

134
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:06,098
You know, what they call in
books, 'marrying beneath me'.

135
00:09:06,903 --> 00:09:08,927
Suppose you listen to an old woman.
- Old?

136
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,698
Well, old enough.

137
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:12,733
Now then. Listen.

138
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:14,715
When I married Richard's father.

139
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:16,305
I was a schoolteacher.

140
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:18,759
And he was a youngest son.
A captain in the army.

141
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:20,786
We had no money.

142
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:22,553
But we were awfully in love.

143
00:09:23,366 --> 00:09:24,959
Just for the sake of argument.

144
00:09:25,326 --> 00:09:26,799
Suppose I had taken your attitude.

145
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:28,762
Why, Nellie.

146
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,405
We should have missed
many years of happiness.

147
00:09:33,128 --> 00:09:34,926
And we still rather like each other.

148
00:09:36,214 --> 00:09:37,827
Now if you want my real opinion.

149
00:09:38,237 --> 00:09:40,370
I think Richard's
pretty lucky to get you.

150
00:09:40,757 --> 00:09:43,009
Yes, my dear. Take us as you find us.

151
00:09:43,535 --> 00:09:45,330
And we'll all try to be happy.

152
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:06,425
Now the thug.

153
00:10:07,002 --> 00:10:09,160
Has his victim at his mercy.

154
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:11,253
Release me. You're strangling me.

155
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,162
All that beastly thing lacks
is a mouth with fangs.

156
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:22,941
I say, doctor.

157
00:10:23,312 --> 00:10:25,348
The professor seems
a bit of a thug himself.

158
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:28,448
Yes. He gave a bit of a
realistic demonstration.

159
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:31,754
And so.

160
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:35,422
That's the method the thugs use
to remove their enemies, eh?

161
00:10:36,034 --> 00:10:36,830
Yes.

162
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,683
Which proves to me conclusively.

163
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,144
That they had no hand.

164
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:46,295
In the killing of Mr Lee.

165
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:52,192
You don't think that Lee's articles
attacking the Thugee cult ..

166
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:54,339
Prompted his death?

167
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,542
A thug.

168
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,816
Never spills blood.

169
00:11:01,782 --> 00:11:04,970
You forget the veiled charmer, doctor.
She is my choice.

170
00:11:05,377 --> 00:11:07,003
No. I haven't forgotten the woman.

171
00:11:07,574 --> 00:11:09,795
Now that Delzante is
here for the investigation.

172
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:13,787
I feel pretty sure that her
identity will soon be disclosed.

173
00:11:14,237 --> 00:11:15,024
Look here.

174
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:17,704
To aid the crown in its
search for the guilty one.

175
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:20,910
I propose a whiskey and soda.

176
00:11:21,425 --> 00:11:22,670
And a rubber of bridge.

177
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:26,003
A charming idea. And Nellie.

178
00:11:26,557 --> 00:11:27,915
See if you can find Richard.

179
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:30,432
He is probably with
Sir Roscoe and Mr Wales.

180
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:33,600
I told her it would be
a jolly good idea.

181
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:35,448
Surely, Howard. You are spoofing.

182
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:37,440
I grant you it's a bit grotesque.

183
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:38,876
But nevertheless.

184
00:11:39,476 --> 00:11:42,117
Edward Wales has prevailed
upon Lady Crosby.

185
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,054
To allow that spirit medium or ..

186
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,222
Fortune teller or whatever you call it.

187
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:51,859
To give a seance here tonight.
- That would be perfectly thrilling.

188
00:11:52,331 --> 00:11:53,688
A marvelous idea.
- I see.

189
00:11:54,193 --> 00:11:56,742
So tonight we are to dabble
in witchcraft and occultism?

190
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:59,647
If she is a true medium
your eyes will be opened.

191
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,748
I attended a seance in
Berlin at Madam Bogarts.

192
00:12:03,494 --> 00:12:05,603
And through her spirit control.

193
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:07,267
I conversed.

194
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,448
With my dead mother.

195
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:12,471
By Jove.

196
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:14,697
I have an idea.

197
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:18,086
We should call on the
spirit of Spencer Lee.

198
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:20,070
And I shall say to him.

199
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:21,635
'Spencer, dear old chap'.

200
00:12:22,114 --> 00:12:23,490
'Tell us. Who killed you'?

201
00:12:24,355 --> 00:12:25,056
Howard.

202
00:12:25,774 --> 00:12:27,008
That's just sacrilege.

203
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,843
It is not.
- Don't be silly.

204
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,071
I am serious.

205
00:12:35,403 --> 00:12:37,736
But I don't understand what
you are talking about.

206
00:12:39,832 --> 00:12:41,893
Mr Wales, I demand an apology
for what you just said.

207
00:12:42,324 --> 00:12:43,483
Richard, calm yourself.

208
00:12:44,102 --> 00:12:46,141
Mr Wales, I am waiting.
- Richard.

209
00:12:47,256 --> 00:12:48,833
In your eyes my action is almost ..

210
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:50,781
Indefensible.

211
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:52,544
I am admitting that.

212
00:12:53,241 --> 00:12:55,323
But I have very good reasons for asking.

213
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,993
What I am asking.

214
00:13:00,683 --> 00:13:01,498
Sir Roscoe.

215
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:04,021
I've been your close
friend for many years.

216
00:13:04,648 --> 00:13:06,227
You've trusted me and believed in me.

217
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:11,181
I ask you not to announce Richard's
engagement to Miss O'Neill tonight.

218
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:13,113
After all.

219
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:16,782
24 hours can't make any
difference, Richard.

220
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,376
And it may save you all a
great deal of unhappiness.

221
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:21,730
Mr Wales.

222
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:23,955
I don't know what you will discover.

223
00:13:24,312 --> 00:13:27,367
But it's nothing of which I am ashamed.
- Dear, you mustn't mind what he says.

224
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:28,480
But I do.

225
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,034
I know it's about my mother.
The most wonderful woman in the world.

226
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:33,645
I won't have her attacked.

227
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:35,001
Miss O'Neill.

228
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,042
I don't know your mother.

229
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:40,567
I've never even heard of her.
- Then you should explain ..

230
00:13:40,955 --> 00:13:43,843
Richard, I would rather be
shot than do what I am doing.

231
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:47,203
But if I'm wrong I will come
to you gladly and say so.

232
00:13:47,798 --> 00:13:50,290
I'll apologise to Miss O'Neill
on my knees if she likes.

233
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,406
Ned, I don't know
what this is all about.

234
00:13:53,596 --> 00:13:55,707
But knowing you as I do
I shall take your suggestion.

235
00:13:56,074 --> 00:13:57,536
But father ..
- Richard, please.

236
00:13:58,892 --> 00:13:59,822
But I warn you.

237
00:14:00,597 --> 00:14:03,978
Tomorrow I shall expect you to explain
everything to my entire satisfaction.

238
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:06,665
You have my word, Sir Roscoe.
- Very well.

239
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:10,665
I think we'll let the matter
rest for this evening and ..

240
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:12,265
Join Lady Crosby.

241
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,552
Dad, could I speak to you just a minute?

242
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,829
Will you join the ladies, Ned.

243
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:19,572
Dad, you can't ..
- Richard. Richard.

244
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,315
Ned has evidently gone off on
the wrong foot somewhere.

245
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:25,593
But don't worry.

246
00:14:26,072 --> 00:14:27,402
Things will right themselves.

247
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,253
Have we time for another rubber?
- I don't think I would.

248
00:14:30,558 --> 00:14:31,790
They're here in a minute.

249
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:34,393
I'm afraid this seance is
going to be a frightful bore.

250
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:36,146
Don't say that.

251
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:37,521
You needn't come.

252
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:38,934
Edward.

253
00:14:39,206 --> 00:14:41,967
Madam La Grange, the fortune-teller
you sent the car for has arrived.

254
00:14:42,356 --> 00:14:43,856
May we see her now?
- Certainly.

255
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:46,826
Chotee, ask Madam La Grange
to please come here.

256
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:49,831
I say. Do you really suppose she
expects to be taken seriously?

257
00:14:50,825 --> 00:14:53,212
But then, if we don't laugh at
her we'll have no end of fun.

258
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:56,175
I will rag her terribly. And she'll
never know it in all the world.

259
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:57,201
Mary.

260
00:14:57,503 --> 00:14:58,576
I shouldn't do that.

261
00:14:58,887 --> 00:15:00,274
Edward says she's quite clever.

262
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:04,193
The great Madam La Grange.
I'll bet you I can describe her.

263
00:15:04,802 --> 00:15:08,427
A tall dark-haired creature.
A regular adventuress. Am I right?

264
00:15:09,016 --> 00:15:11,796
She is the most remarkable
woman I have ever known.

265
00:15:12,832 --> 00:15:14,503
Madam Rosalie La Grange.

266
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,339
Good evening to all of you.

267
00:15:16,786 --> 00:15:18,345
How do you do, Madam La Grange.

268
00:15:18,762 --> 00:15:20,517
Very well, thank you, ma'am.
- I'm glad.

269
00:15:21,492 --> 00:15:22,940
How are you, Mr Wales?

270
00:15:23,495 --> 00:15:25,877
To be sure, it was a grand
hack you sent for me.

271
00:15:26,243 --> 00:15:27,805
We wanted you to be comfortable.

272
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,388
I was that.

273
00:15:29,923 --> 00:15:30,767
Do you know?

274
00:15:31,253 --> 00:15:33,206
When the Hindu gentleman came for me.

275
00:15:33,902 --> 00:15:36,274
I thought at first it
was the Rajah himself.

276
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,217
I hope you were not frightened.

277
00:15:39,991 --> 00:15:41,117
Definitely not.

278
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:44,742
I'd like to see the Hindu
that can frighten me.

279
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:46,595
Nice boys them Hindus.

280
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,114
And most of them good Christians.

281

When they are asleep.

282
00:15:53,257 --> 00:15:54,343
Won't you sit down?

283
00:15:56,266 --> 00:15:57,253
Thank you, ma'am.

284
00:15:58,067 --> 00:16:00,050
Are you quite comfortable?
- I am.

285
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,291
So, you tell fortunes?

286
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:04,702
No, Miss. I do not.

287
00:16:05,437 --> 00:16:08,357
I get messages from them
that has passed on.

288
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:14,008
I don't hold with the cards or
tea leaves or any of them tricks.

Miss.

290
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,945
Once in a while.

291
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:20,622
I give advice.

292
00:16:22,892 --> 00:16:23,987
If I were you.

293
00:16:24,763 --> 00:16:28,403
I'd pay that bill of a thousand
rupees that you owe in the bazaar.

294
00:16:31,472 --> 00:16:33,954
We are expecting great things from
you tonight, Madam La Grange.

295
00:16:34,257 --> 00:16:36,074
How did you know I owed
a bill at the bazaar?

296
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,687
Well, you left the bill in
your bag in the hall.

297
00:16:40,627 --> 00:16:42,514
While I was waiting I read it.

298
00:16:43,076 --> 00:16:44,678
How did you know it was my bag?

299
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:45,728
Sure.

300
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,238
The stuff on the bag.
Matched that stuff on your dress.

301
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:53,300
Then it's all trickery?

302
00:16:55,121 --> 00:16:56,555
It is now. And then it ain't.

303
00:16:57,258 --> 00:17:00,196
That is the sort of demonstration
we're going to get from you tonight?

304
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:03,324
Didn't Mr Wales tell you?
- I've told them nothing.

305
00:17:04,172 --> 00:17:06,299
Well then, tell them now please.

306
00:17:07,524 --> 00:17:08,253
You see.

307
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,269
As I told you some time ago.

308
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:13,195
Madam La Grange has done things that ..

309
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,362
That cannot be explained.

310
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,490
When I asked her to come here tonight.

311
00:17:17,834 --> 00:17:20,078
She said she would
under certain conditions.

312
00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:23,008
You mean test conditions?
- Not exactly.

313
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:26,919
What she said was, that no
money should pass between us.

314
00:17:27,389 --> 00:17:29,252
And that anything she
would do tonight ..

315
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:31,021
Would be honest.

316
00:17:31,388 --> 00:17:32,985
You would not play us any tricks?

317
00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:35,288
If I do, I will tell you.

318
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,966
Yes, of course. We understand
all about spirit rapping.

319
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:42,826
Rather. That's old stuff.

320
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,614
Well, what do you think of that?

321
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,216
You have to be near a table
or something like that.

322
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:49,529
And then.

323
00:17:50,107 --> 00:17:51,324
Maybe a chair.

324
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:53,426
Or a desk would do.
- Yes?

325
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:55,001
And then in the dark.

326
00:17:55,433 --> 00:17:57,184
Of course. In the dark.

327
00:17:58,191 --> 00:17:59,949
You get one rap for 'Yes'.

328
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:01,633
And two for 'No'?

329
00:18:07,605 --> 00:18:09,220

- It can't be a trick.

watched her hands every minute.

358
00:19:27,927 --> 00:19:30,960
I know I am a stranger to
all of you except Mr Wales.

359
00:19:31,782 --> 00:19:33,198
I don't know whose house I'm in.

360
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:34,666
That's quite true.

361
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,587
You gave her no hint of any kind?

362
00:19:37,107 --> 00:19:37,710
No.

363
00:19:38,186 --> 00:19:39,935
On my honour.
- Madam La Grange.

364
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:41,153
Sir.

365
00:19:41,541 --> 00:19:43,520
I know a man who saw
this woman Paladino ..

366
00:19:44,114 --> 00:19:46,587
Lift a table just by
putting her hands on it.

367
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,211
Would someone give me the
little card table over there.

368
00:19:57,217 --> 00:19:59,294
I suppose this is going to
be another fake trick.

369
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,963
It can be done.

370
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,279
It can be done.

371
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:09,744
I don't know if I can
do it in the light.

372
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:12,231
But if you want.

373
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:14,375
I will try.
- Please do.

374
00:20:14,803 --> 00:20:16,077
Please, without trickery.

375
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:19,087
I mean.

376
00:20:20,591 --> 00:20:21,378
Like this.

377
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:37,918
Miraculous.

378
00:20:38,307 --> 00:20:40,014
The most remarkable
thing I've ever seen.

379
00:20:40,986 --> 00:20:43,472
Now. Now you all know what I can do.

380
00:20:45,254 --> 00:20:46,582
I can fool you too.

381
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:49,214
So you have to take my
word for it that I won't.

382
00:20:50,554 --> 00:20:52,639
Now I will go into a
trance for you, if you like.

383
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:57,334
The spirit controls
a sweet little child.

384
00:20:57,762 --> 00:20:58,901
Named 'Laughing-Eyes'.

385
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:01,010
Wait.

386
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:02,873
Don't speak.

387
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:06,022
Don't.

388
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:07,978
Don't say anything.

389
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,863
There's a message coming.

390
00:21:11,694 --> 00:21:12,738
There is a message.

391
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:18,536
No.

392
00:21:19,131 --> 00:21:20,552
No. Laughing-Eyes is gone.

393
00:21:21,937 --> 00:21:23,341
It is the unbelievers.

394
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:25,587
Most of you don't believe.

395
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:27,984
It's hard to get messages that way.

396
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:29,574
I think.

397
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,795
I think I might as well
go about my business.

398
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:36,400
I thought she would when she found
out she was at Sir Roscoe's house.

399
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,145
Did you now?

400
00:21:38,753 --> 00:21:41,437
Won't you please stay?
- I'm afraid I can't, ma'am.

401
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:44,980
You see, I'm not just myself.
I'm not feeling just right.

402
00:21:45,318 --> 00:21:47,077
Madam La Grange,
under the circumstances ..

403
00:21:47,449 --> 00:21:48,407
I am sorry, sir.

404
00:21:48,785 --> 00:21:50,896
But I got to go home.
- I think it's a shame.

405
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:52,970
I think she is quite right to go.

406
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,842
Her sort of tricks aren't for
people of intelligence.

407
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,201
Well.

408
00:21:58,602 --> 00:22:00,055
Won't you please stay?

409
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:02,647
I must not, Miss.
- But won't you?

410
00:22:03,193 --> 00:22:05,143
As a very great favour to me?

411
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,166
Please.

412
00:22:12,644 --> 00:22:13,459
Well, Miss.

413
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:15,659
Since you ask it.

414
00:22:16,512 --> 00:22:17,435
I'll stay.

415
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:18,757
Madam La Grange.

416
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:22,771
I assure you I am very interested
in the outcome of this seance.

417
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:26,560
I warn you I shall watch your
manifestations very closely.

418
00:22:27,015 --> 00:22:28,296
Do so, sir. I want you to.

419
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:31,567
I am going to ask you to
submit to certain conditions.

420
00:22:32,298 --> 00:22:34,728
Anything at all, sir. Anything at all.

421
00:22:35,335 --> 00:22:37,776
To forestall any
assistance from outside.

422
00:22:38,532 --> 00:22:39,595
I want to suggest.

423
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:43,020
That all the doors and windows
of this room be securely locked.

424
00:22:43,408 --> 00:22:44,023
Yes.

425
00:22:44,426 --> 00:22:46,309
And I suggest that we
search Madam La Grange.

426
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:48,576
That is of course, if she is willing.

427
00:22:49,272 --> 00:22:50,063
Why not?

428
00:22:50,547 --> 00:22:52,594
There's no holes in my stockings.

429
00:22:55,013 --> 00:22:57,381
I suppose it will be very difficult
for you to get results ..

430
00:22:57,806 --> 00:22:59,328
If we're all so antagonistic.

431
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:02,673
It's up to them.

432
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:07,278
If there's any that wants to
communicate with anyone.

433
00:23:08,675 --> 00:23:09,915
Maybe they can reach us.

434
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:11,692
I don't know.

435
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:14,081
Sure, I don't understand you at all.

436
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:15,934
I show you my tricks.

437
00:23:16,454 --> 00:23:19,090
Would I do that if I wanted to fool you?
I would not.

438
00:23:19,794 --> 00:23:21,820
Then why not give me
credit for being honest?

439
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,231
I don't think any of
us doubt your honesty.

440
00:23:24,923 --> 00:23:26,232
They are just sceptical.

441
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:27,841
Thank you, ma'am.

442
00:23:28,063 --> 00:23:31,173
I don't think we need submit
Madam La Grange to being searched.

443
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:32,866
I'm sure I don't mind, ma'am.

444
00:23:33,604 --> 00:23:36,446
That is, if none of you fine
ladies will be shocked.

445
00:23:37,054 --> 00:23:39,307
Seeing plain, hand-sewn underwear.

446
00:23:40,533 --> 00:23:43,096
Then will you come with me?
I am sure we won't be shocked.

447
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:46,432
I wear that kind myself.
- Do you now, ma'am?

448
00:23:46,877 --> 00:23:47,893
We shan't be long.

449
00:23:48,248 --> 00:23:48,962
Ma'am.

450
00:23:49,503 --> 00:23:51,717
Would you mind if all the ladies came?

451
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,653
Then they'll all be sure I'm
not concealing anything.

452
00:24:00,024 --> 00:24:02,405
I really believe that woman
has a power of some sort.

453
00:24:02,925 --> 00:24:03,912
Look here, Wales.

454
00:24:04,135 --> 00:24:05,408
What are we supposed to do?

455
00:24:05,793 --> 00:24:07,498
Ask her a lot of silly questions?

456
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,129
I am going to find out
who killed Spencer Lee.

457
00:24:13,172 --> 00:24:14,770
You are going to do what, Edward?

458
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,419
I am going to try to communicate.

459
00:24:18,943 --> 00:24:21,331
With the spirit of Spencer Lee.

460
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:25,664
So that's your reason for bringing
this woman here tonight?

461
00:24:26,113 --> 00:24:26,947
Precisely.

462
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,217
Have you any objections, Sir Roscoe?

463
00:24:30,813 --> 00:24:31,404
No.

464
00:24:31,758 --> 00:24:34,599
Look here, Wales.
Spencer Lee was an out-and-out rotter.

465
00:24:35,097 --> 00:24:36,370
Brandon.
- It's the truth.

466
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,755
His killing was good
riddance to bad rubbish.

467
00:24:39,101 --> 00:24:41,784
Wait. Spencer Lee was my friend.

468
00:24:42,805 --> 00:24:44,123
Gentlemen, I beg of you.

469
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,654
You see, Mary.
It was quite a waste of time.

470
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:47,883
Quite absurd.

471
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,800
I am perfectly satisfied anyway.

472
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,394
You should be.

473
00:24:52,797 --> 00:24:54,119
I am glad of that, Miss.

474
00:24:54,835 --> 00:24:58,415
Did you expect to find trap doors
and fake spirits up my sleeves?

475
00:24:59,256 --> 00:25:00,483
One can never tell.

476
00:25:01,087 --> 00:25:01,673
No.

477
00:25:02,383 --> 00:25:06,570
And suppose that mine is the
only trade there is any tricks in.

478
00:25:07,134 --> 00:25:07,852
May I?

479
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:09,883
Thank you, Miss.

480
00:25:11,131 --> 00:25:13,497
Ma'am. Would you tell the gentlemen ..

481
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:16,859
To put the chairs in a circle.
Then I'll be right along.

482
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,547
I hope you forgive us
for being so sceptical.

483
00:25:22,369 --> 00:25:24,419
I hope she has some good
news to tell us anyway.

484
00:25:35,377 --> 00:25:38,302
At least we found out that she
had nothing concealed on her.

485
00:25:41,868 --> 00:25:43,047
Darling.
- Mother.

486
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:44,651
I did not know.

487
00:25:45,284 --> 00:25:48,425
I wouldn't have come here
for anything in the world.

488
00:25:49,088 --> 00:25:49,903
I wouldn't.

489
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:53,366
They just brought me here.
I didn't know where I was coming.

490
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:55,084
Don't tell them.

491
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:58,380
Don't make me shame you
before your fine friends.

492
00:25:59,092 --> 00:26:01,199
I'll get away as quick as I can.
- Mother.

493
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:03,304
Don't say that.

494
00:26:04,075 --> 00:26:06,545
There is no shame, darling.
I am proud. Proud.

495
00:26:06,925 --> 00:26:08,749
Don't ever say that again.

496
00:26:10,107 --> 00:26:11,094
Alright, darling.

497
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,675
Tell them if you must.

498
00:26:13,043 --> 00:26:14,934
But let me get away first.

499
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,246
No.

500
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,751
Now I must go or they'll think
there is something wrong.

501
00:26:20,223 --> 00:26:21,162
Come along.

502
00:26:21,732 --> 00:26:23,957
I do wish you would let me tell them.
- No.

503
00:26:37,853 --> 00:26:39,412
Yes, gentlemen. In a circle, I think.

504
00:26:39,845 --> 00:26:41,776
Sorry, Sir Roscoe, if you
feel that way about it.

505
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,334
Not a matter of feeling.

506
00:26:43,955 --> 00:26:45,789
I'm just a little sceptical perhaps.

507
00:26:47,555 --> 00:26:48,809
On the table I think.

508
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,897
You sit there, Howard?
- Yes. I sit here.

509
00:26:51,201 --> 00:26:53,056
One, two, three, four.

510
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,146
Yes. I might want lights.

511
00:26:57,028 --> 00:26:57,766
Richard.

512
00:26:58,264 --> 00:27:01,362
If I call for lights, give them to me.
Don't wait for anything.

513
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:03,290
Right, dad. I'll sit right there.

514
00:27:07,088 --> 00:27:09,412
I assure you she has
nothing up her sleeve.

515
00:27:10,104 --> 00:27:11,175
Well, well.

516
00:27:12,223 --> 00:27:14,174
I am glad you are satisfied.

517
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:15,985
Yes.

518
00:27:16,706 --> 00:27:17,722
Yes. That's right.

519
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:19,994
That's the way we want it.

520
00:27:20,577 --> 00:27:23,118
Now if you all sit in a circle.
- Madam La Grange.

521
00:27:23,682 --> 00:27:24,779
Will you sit here?

522
00:27:25,573 --> 00:27:26,755
I will. Thank you.

523
00:27:28,383 --> 00:27:29,460
I will so.

524
00:27:30,952 --> 00:27:32,345
Now if you all sit down.

525
00:27:32,725 --> 00:27:35,389
How shall we sit? I mean, do you
want us in any particular order?

526
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:36,873
Anywhere at all, sir.

527
00:27:37,215 --> 00:27:38,574
I sit next to you, sir Roscoe?

528
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:40,766
I've always wanted to
hold your hand, my dear.

529
00:27:41,496 --> 00:27:43,235
Don't trust him, Grace.
- I won't.

530
00:27:43,553 --> 00:27:44,763
I'll chaperone them.

531
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:46,631
Will you sit by me, Miss O'Neill?

532
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:48,804
You know, I am really
getting quite a thrill.

533
00:27:50,725 --> 00:27:52,252
What's the joke, Madam La Grange?

534
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:56,023
Well, Miss. I didn't know
anything would give you a thrill.

535
00:27:56,773 --> 00:27:58,137
You don't like me, do you?

536
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:01,190
I am crazy about you.

537
00:28:02,496 --> 00:28:04,723
Chotee, I want you to put
those keys in your pocket.

538
00:28:05,806 --> 00:28:08,378
Now, I want you to lock
this door on the outside.

539
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:14,100
Now, Stand outside the door and
don't unlock it until I tell you.

540
00:28:14,483 --> 00:28:15,859
Understand?
- Yes, Sahib.

541
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:22,581
Are you there, Chotee?
- Yes, Sahib.

542
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:26,797
Now I think we're ready.

543
00:28:28,287 --> 00:28:29,306
Edward, wait.

544
00:28:31,103 --> 00:28:32,745
There's thirteen of us. Don't sit down.

545
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,792
I don't buy those superstitions.
- But ..

546
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:36,283
What will we do now?

547
00:28:37,374 --> 00:28:40,184
If you'll all join hands.
- That will be jolly.

548
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:42,457
If you'll all join hands.

549
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:44,475
And then keep quiet.

550
00:28:46,815 --> 00:28:48,416
Don't try to think of anything.

551
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:50,666
By Jove. That will be easy for me.

552
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:53,774
Now, now. We can't get results if
you're going to treat this as a joke.

553
00:28:54,488 --> 00:28:57,016
Yes. I think we should do
as Madam La Grange asks.

554
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,891
I suppose you'd like the lights out?

555
00:29:01,048 --> 00:29:02,964
You'd get better results that way.

556
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:10,331
Richard, will you put out
that light when we're ready?

557
00:29:10,674 --> 00:29:11,718
Right you are, dad.

558
00:29:12,482 --> 00:29:16,585
You must not be frightened if I cry out
out or moan when I go into the trance.

559
00:29:17,502 --> 00:29:19,512
I'm not in pain or anything like that.

560
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:21,798
I don't even know that I do it.

561
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:24,254
But I'm told sometimes it happens.

562
00:29:27,527 --> 00:29:29,479
Now, sir. You can put out the light.

563
00:29:36,805 --> 00:29:38,371
[ Female scream! ]

564
00:29:40,594 --> 00:29:41,661
[ Female scream! ]

565
00:29:42,242 --> 00:29:43,693
There's a hand on my face.

566
00:29:44,085 --> 00:29:46,381
There's a hand on my face!
- Lights on.

567
00:29:48,358 --> 00:29:49,485
Look. It's a trick.

568
00:29:50,045 --> 00:29:52,449
I was going to ask you
to tie my hands just now.

569
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:55,632
But I thought I would
show you this one first.

570
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,477
I don't see how you did that, even now.

571
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:02,481
No, Miss. I hardly thought you would.

572
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,324
You see, Miss.

573
00:30:05,942 --> 00:30:07,477
Things happen in the dark.

574
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,259
The sense of touch.

575
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:11,880
Ain't much developed.

576
00:30:12,486 --> 00:30:13,634
Unless you are blind.

577
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,626
When the young gentleman
took his hand away from me.

578
00:30:18,247 --> 00:30:19,377
To turn out the light.

579
00:30:20,047 --> 00:30:22,473
I took my other hand from
the gentleman there.

580
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:24,808
When you all joined hands again.

581
00:30:25,563 --> 00:30:27,618
The two gentlemen was holding hands.

582
00:30:27,963 --> 00:30:29,404
As comfortable as you like.

583
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,122
And I was free.

584
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:33,564
It's an old trick.

585
00:30:34,254 --> 00:30:35,816
All the mediums use it.

586
00:30:36,861 --> 00:30:38,090
Anyone can do it.

587
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:41,828
Now, sir. If you'll tie me in.

588
00:30:42,446 --> 00:30:44,078
We will go on.
- We'll see to that.

589
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:45,770
We'll want something strong.

590
00:30:46,103 --> 00:30:47,662
Handkerchiefs. They're strong enough.

591
00:30:47,974 --> 00:30:49,075
They'll do very well.

592
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:50,895
We shall want three more.

593
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,307
Here's mine, dad.

594
00:30:52,668 --> 00:30:54,171
Here is mine.
- Thank you.

595
00:30:55,368 --> 00:30:57,174
Now, Madam La Grange. If you don't mind.

596
00:30:57,577 --> 00:30:59,915
Now, I don't see why
you did that just now.

597
00:31:01,032 --> 00:31:03,000
I wanted to make them tie me in.

598
00:31:03,823 --> 00:31:05,258
I wanted you to be sure.

599
00:31:05,671 --> 00:31:06,286
Why?

600
00:31:07,653 --> 00:31:09,894
Because I think something
is going to happen.

601
00:31:10,942 --> 00:31:13,291
I feel there will be manifestations.

602
00:31:14,937 --> 00:31:17,362
I wanted you all to be
sure I was not faking.

603
00:31:18,161 --> 00:31:19,904
I don't believe all that is necessary.

604
00:31:20,757 --> 00:31:22,127
Why not if they want it?

605
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,161
Doctor.

606
00:31:23,578 --> 00:31:25,616
Will you check up after me?
- Right.

607
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,785
There. That's alright.

608
00:31:31,596 --> 00:31:33,085
Now I am sure you can't get away.

609
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,192
Yes. So am I.

610
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:38,312
So if you will all join hands again.

611
00:31:39,913 --> 00:31:42,279
You have to reach over and
take my hands this time.

612
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,663
Now, just keep your minds free.

613
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,525
That is all you have to do.

614
00:31:56,463 --> 00:31:57,366
Now, sir.

615
00:31:58,658 --> 00:32:00,722
You can put out the light.

616
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:25,575
I can't stand this. I can't stand it.

617
00:32:26,047 --> 00:32:28,224
Be quiet please.
She asked us to keep still.

618
00:32:29,644 --> 00:32:31,811
<i>Laughing-Eyes is saying</i>.

619
00:32:32,956 --> 00:32:34,176
<i>They say</i>.

620
00:32:35,213 --> 00:32:36,388
<i>A long way off</i>.

621
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:38,846
<i>Bad people. Bad people</i>.

622
00:32:39,422 --> 00:32:40,276
<i>Unhappy</i>.

623
00:32:40,942 --> 00:32:42,521
<i>She is unhappy</i>.

624
00:32:44,367 --> 00:32:45,011
<i>Yes</i>.

625
00:32:46,561 --> 00:32:47,411
<i>Spencer</i>.

626
00:32:48,202 --> 00:32:49,492
<i>Wants Ned</i>.

627
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,774
<i>Spencer wants to tell
him about the letter</i>.

628
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,369
<i>And the pain in the back</i>.

629
00:32:56,272 --> 00:32:57,116
<i>In the back</i>.

630
00:32:57,673 --> 00:32:58,774
What was in the back?

631
00:32:59,274 --> 00:33:00,650
Ask him what was in the back.

632
00:33:01,719 --> 00:33:02,517
<i>Ned</i>.

633
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:04,485
<i>He wants Ned</i>.

634
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:05,903
What do you want?

635
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:09,078
<i>Ned. The swimming pool</i>.

636
00:33:09,889 --> 00:33:10,795
<i>Don't forget</i>.

637
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,079
<i>The swimming pool</i>.

638
00:33:13,483 --> 00:33:16,305
You mean, the time you went in
after me when I was drowning?

639
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:19,512
<i>Spencer says he can't rest</i>.

640
00:33:20,629 --> 00:33:21,250
<i>You</i>.

641
00:33:21,974 --> 00:33:22,781
<i>Promised</i>.

642
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,744
Spencer. Of course I remember.

643
00:33:26,227 --> 00:33:27,605
What do you want me to do?

644
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:29,145
<i>Find</i>.

645
00:33:30,326 --> 00:33:32,272
<i>Find .. the letters</i>.

646
00:33:32,652 --> 00:33:34,611
You mean, you want
me to find the letters?

647
00:33:36,896 --> 00:33:38,257
<i>Someone came</i>.

648
00:33:39,052 --> 00:33:40,483
<i>Someone came</i>.

649
00:33:40,817 --> 00:33:42,360
You're trying to say who killed you?

650
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:43,354
<i>Ask</i>.

651
00:33:43,951 --> 00:33:44,634
<i>Ask</i>.

652
00:33:44,952 --> 00:33:46,154
You know who killed you?

653
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:49,023
<i>Ned</i>.

654
00:33:49,674 --> 00:33:51,010
<i>He wants Ned</i>.

655
00:33:51,402 --> 00:33:53,191
You want me to ask?

656
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,149
Do you know who killed you?

657
00:33:55,572 --> 00:33:57,210
This is horrible. Horrible.

658
00:33:57,611 --> 00:33:58,626
Quiet, daughter.

659
00:33:59,757 --> 00:34:01,765
Can .. can you tell the name?

660
00:34:02,537 --> 00:34:03,209
Quick.

661
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:04,710
Quick. The name.

662
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,942
The name.

663
00:34:06,762 --> 00:34:08,748
Spencer, can you tell who killed you?

664
00:34:09,209 --> 00:34:11,354
<i>You must keep asking</i>.

665
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,220
Who killed you?

666
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,184
Who?

667
00:34:14,861 --> 00:34:15,681
Ahh!

668
00:34:17,277 --> 00:34:18,636
Wales, is anything the matter?

669
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:21,637
Richard, the light.

670
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:23,055
Turn on the lamp.

671
00:34:26,183 --> 00:34:27,129
Look at him.

672
00:34:28,207 --> 00:34:29,831
Stand back please. Stand back.

673
00:34:30,257 --> 00:34:31,109
Doctor.

674
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,073
He's dead.

675
00:34:41,525 --> 00:34:42,640
It's impossible.

676
00:34:43,691 --> 00:34:45,273
Look at your hands. Oh.

677
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:47,273
Chotee.

678
00:34:47,697 --> 00:34:49,159
Chotee.
- Yes, Sahib?

679
00:34:50,392 --> 00:34:52,151
Telephone the police
commissioner's office.

680
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:54,759
Get Inspector Delzante if you can.

681
00:34:55,711 --> 00:34:57,070
Tell him to come here at once.

682
00:35:02,465 --> 00:35:03,716
Stabbed in the back.

683
00:35:05,722 --> 00:35:07,557
Just as Spencer Lee was.

684
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:10,117
It was just as he was asking ..

685
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:12,667
Just as he was going
to find out who killed ..

686
00:35:13,326 --> 00:35:14,141
What is it?

687
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,499
Inspector Delzante is on his way, sir.

688
00:35:18,438 --> 00:35:19,625
Shall I unlock the door?

689
00:35:23,736 --> 00:35:24,322
No.

690
00:35:25,595 --> 00:35:27,246
Not until the inspector tells you.

691
00:35:33,476 --> 00:35:36,738
Sir Roscoe, you know you had no
right to move Mr Wales' body.

692
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:40,092
Yes, yes. I know. But we couldn't
leave him lying here on the floor.

693
00:35:40,923 --> 00:35:42,196
That was a little too much.

694
00:35:42,994 --> 00:35:44,525
You see, we were all locked in here.

695
00:35:45,049 --> 00:35:46,977
Now, if you ask me ..
- Just a minute.

696
00:35:49,558 --> 00:35:51,022
Locked in?
- Exactly.

697
00:35:51,531 --> 00:35:53,091
You mean as I found you when I came?

698
00:35:53,394 --> 00:35:54,009
Yes.

699
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,440
All the doors and windows
were locked for the seance.

700
00:35:56,933 --> 00:35:58,120
The servant had the key.

701
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:01,677
I refused to let him unlock
the door until you came.

702
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:05,106
So you were in the dark?

703
00:36:06,173 --> 00:36:07,856
Wales was stabbed in the back.

704
00:36:09,272 --> 00:36:10,953
The lights were turned on.

705
00:36:12,698 --> 00:36:14,257
By the way, who turned on the lights?

706
00:36:15,013 --> 00:36:16,280
I did, Inspector.

707
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:19,543
I was sitting there in that chair.
Close to the light purposely.

708
00:36:20,156 --> 00:36:22,303
So that we could expose
trickery if we found any.

709
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:25,280
You must let me have
a look at that knife.

710
00:36:25,671 --> 00:36:27,084
We did not find the knife.

711
00:36:28,213 --> 00:36:29,950
You looked carefully?
- Everywhere.

712
00:36:30,328 --> 00:36:31,687
While we were waiting for you.

713
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,369
That places all of you ..

714
00:36:37,182 --> 00:36:38,310
Under suspicion.

715
00:36:39,524 --> 00:36:40,620
Every one of you.

716
00:36:42,705 --> 00:36:44,104
So, whoever used that knife ..

717
00:36:44,707 --> 00:36:45,602
Still has it.

718
00:36:46,012 --> 00:36:47,941
I should think so. Undoubtedly.

719
00:36:50,137 --> 00:36:52,562
With the exception of
Sir Roscoe and his family.

720
00:36:54,018 --> 00:36:55,254
I know none of you.

721
00:36:57,194 --> 00:36:58,181
So I have to ask.

722
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,188
Now.

723
00:37:03,649 --> 00:37:04,293
That.

724
00:37:05,382 --> 00:37:07,099
Rather gruesome thing there.

725
00:37:09,401 --> 00:37:10,831
I think we will remove it.

726
00:37:12,128 --> 00:37:14,215
Will some of you gentlemen
carry Mr Wales body ..

727
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:16,038
Into another room.

728
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,242
Will you gentlemen take the feet?
Doctor, you and I can ..

729
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,734
Just a moment.

730
00:37:44,152 --> 00:37:44,796
Well.

731
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,403
The test did not work very well, did it?

732
00:37:48,593 --> 00:37:50,220
The four of you hesitated.

733
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:52,952
Certainly, you can't all be guilty.

734
00:37:53,787 --> 00:37:54,648
Well.

735
00:37:55,632 --> 00:37:57,210
We'll have to try something else.

736
00:37:58,053 --> 00:38:01,662
Now, I would like to visualise
the scene a little more clearly.

737
00:38:02,009 --> 00:38:03,440
Let's form that circle again.

738
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:06,529
Of course, this time without Mr Wales.

739
00:38:07,754 --> 00:38:09,985
You all sit just as you
were sitting at the seance.

740
00:38:10,968 --> 00:38:12,636
Well. Richard sat there.

741
00:38:12,994 --> 00:38:14,410
Madam La Grange was next to him.

742
00:38:14,812 --> 00:38:16,171
And I was sitting next to her.

743
00:38:16,512 --> 00:38:17,785
How were the others placed?

744
00:38:18,453 --> 00:38:19,905
I am trying to remember.

745
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:22,495
It's queer what a jumbled
memory one has.

746
00:38:22,796 --> 00:38:24,172
I sat next to you, Sir Roscoe.

747
00:38:24,394 --> 00:38:26,587
Don't you remember?
We joked about holding my hand.

748
00:38:27,495 --> 00:38:28,684
Who sat next please?

749
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,823
Inspector, I can place them all for you.

750
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,519
If you will be so kind.

751
00:38:34,489 --> 00:38:35,733
This young lady was there.

752
00:38:36,234 --> 00:38:37,927
And this gentleman sat next to her.

753
00:38:38,668 --> 00:38:40,558
And this young lady sat next to her.

754
00:38:45,067 --> 00:38:46,791
She .. she was here.

755
00:38:47,614 --> 00:38:49,742
Now, that gentleman came next.

756
00:38:50,401 --> 00:38:51,474
You are wrong there.

757
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,202
I wasn't. No, you're right.

758
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,538
I was there.

759
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:57,560
I remember saying:
'Won't you sit by me, Miss O'Neill'?

760
00:38:58,176 --> 00:38:59,924
Then who sat next to Dr. Mason?

761
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:01,151
Why ..

762
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:03,178
This young lady.

763
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:05,212
Something seems wrong here.

764
00:39:06,047 --> 00:39:08,409
No. That's right.
I was sitting next to you, doctor.

765
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,267
Inspector, must we go
through this again?

766
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:13,093
I am afraid so, Lady Crosby.

767
00:39:17,582 --> 00:39:19,036
Who occupied this seat?

768
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,896
Mr Wales.

769
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,250
I know because I sat here.

770
00:39:24,073 --> 00:39:25,253
And I was next to him.

771
00:39:27,352 --> 00:39:28,218
Thanks.

772
00:39:29,068 --> 00:39:31,886
Now, you are all sure that
you have the right places?

773
00:39:32,814 --> 00:39:34,431
There is some mix-up here. I know.

774
00:39:34,942 --> 00:39:36,600
I was not next to Mr Wales.

775
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:39,989
Of course you weren't.

776
00:39:40,689 --> 00:39:42,534
I don't know what I can
have been thinking of.

777
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,599
I sat where Mrs Eastwood is.

778
00:39:44,988 --> 00:39:45,603
Yes.

779
00:39:46,113 --> 00:39:49,426
I was beside Mrs Standish and Dr. Mason.
I knew I was in the wrong seat.

780
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,477
Then if you ladies exchange places ..

781
00:39:55,971 --> 00:39:58,182
I want you all to be extremely careful.

782
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,613
I don't want any surprises.

783
00:40:01,654 --> 00:40:05,116
Did the messages come
for anyone but Mr Wales?

784
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,955
No. The calls were all for Wales.

785
00:40:07,432 --> 00:40:08,501
He kept on saying:

786
00:40:09,091 --> 00:40:10,888
'Do you know who killed you'?

787
00:40:13,532 --> 00:40:14,797
Did she mention a name?

788
00:40:15,255 --> 00:40:15,841
No.

789
00:40:16,988 --> 00:40:18,338
She gave a long moan.

790
00:40:20,615 --> 00:40:22,262
Then Edward Wales continued to ask.

791
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:23,740
He said:

792
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:25,987
'Tell me who killed you.
I want the name'.

793
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:29,933
Suddenly he gave out an agonised
scream and cried out that he was hurt.

794
00:40:32,372 --> 00:40:34,074
He was dead when we
turned on the lights.

795
00:40:34,343 --> 00:40:35,587
Matron is here, Inspector.

796
00:40:36,403 --> 00:40:37,113
Thanks.

797
00:40:39,586 --> 00:40:41,116
One more question, Sir Roscoe.

798
00:40:42,965 --> 00:40:46,418
Did you get the impression that if
Mr Wales had not been killed ..

799
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,019
His question would have been answered?
- Yes.

800
00:40:50,628 --> 00:40:52,348
It was well established in your mind.

801
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:56,253
That Wales was the only
person <i>able</i> to get a message.

802
00:40:56,636 --> 00:40:57,830
I'm positive.

803
00:40:58,827 --> 00:41:02,411
Then he was killed in order to
prevent his question being answered?

804
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:04,351
That's the impression we got.
- Surely.

805
00:41:04,573 --> 00:41:07,371
That leads to the conclusion
that whoever killed Wales ..

806
00:41:08,253 --> 00:41:10,806
Knew who had killed Spencer Lee.

807
00:41:14,861 --> 00:41:15,558
Well.

808
00:41:16,822 --> 00:41:20,220
There is a police matron in the other
room who will search the ladies.

809
00:41:20,857 --> 00:41:22,573
Grimshaw, the men. One at a time.

810
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:26,065
It makes no difference to
me in what order they go.

811
00:41:26,529 --> 00:41:27,773
I have nothing to conceal.

812
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:31,168
I'd rather you waited a few
minutes, Madam La Grange.

813
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:33,035
I am quite ready.
- So am I.

814
00:41:33,428 --> 00:41:34,501
Thank you very much.

815
00:41:35,072 --> 00:41:36,661
You need not sit there anymore.

816
00:41:37,009 --> 00:41:38,211
Unless you wish.

817
00:41:44,486 --> 00:41:45,215
Richard.

818
00:41:45,874 --> 00:41:47,106
Madam La Grange.

819
00:41:47,616 --> 00:41:48,240
Sir?

820
00:41:49,668 --> 00:41:51,464
There is a question I wish to ask.

821
00:41:52,355 --> 00:41:53,456
Anything at all, sir.

822
00:41:54,049 --> 00:41:57,528
When Mr Wales asked you for the
name, why didn't you answer?

823
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,135
I don't know, sir.

824
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:01,828
I was in a trance.

825
00:42:03,411 --> 00:42:05,057
Then you did not hear the question?

826
00:42:05,487 --> 00:42:07,491
How could I?
- I didn't ask you that.

827
00:42:08,637 --> 00:42:10,225
I asked you why you didn't answer him.

828
00:42:11,046 --> 00:42:13,340
Why did you not carry out
your part of the bargain?

829
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,054
I don't know what you mean.

830
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:18,036
My words are perfectly plain.

831
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,839
Why didn't you carry out
your part of the bargain?

832
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:24,083
There wasn't any bargain.
- Your whole seance was a fake.

833
00:42:26,334 --> 00:42:29,311
It was not only planned but rehearsed.
Between you and Wales.

834
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:32,547
He saw that a woman
had killed his friend.

835
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:36,047
And he told you about it and asked
your help to discover the murderer.

836
00:42:36,988 --> 00:42:39,086
I don't know what you're
talking about at all.

837
00:42:42,003 --> 00:42:42,895
Perhaps this.

838
00:42:43,475 --> 00:42:44,807
Will refresh your memory.

839
00:42:48,731 --> 00:42:49,775
'What do you want'?

840
00:42:50,563 --> 00:42:51,264
Answer:

841
00:42:52,024 --> 00:42:53,469
'Don't forget the swimming pool'.

842
00:42:54,184 --> 00:42:56,115
'Don't ever forget the swimming pool'.

843
00:42:57,336 --> 00:42:57,980
Then.

844
00:42:58,918 --> 00:43:01,851
'Do you mean the time he went
in after me when I was drowning'?

845
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:06,074
Then later.

846
00:43:06,527 --> 00:43:08,544
'Spencer Lee says he can't rest'.

847
00:43:09,292 --> 00:43:11,221
And so on and so on down to ..

848
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:14,483
'Do you know who killed you'?

849
00:43:17,008 --> 00:43:19,408
The answer to that
would have been: 'Yes'.

850
00:43:20,707 --> 00:43:21,706
What did she say?

851
00:43:22,277 --> 00:43:23,926
She did not answer that question.

852
00:43:25,685 --> 00:43:26,786
The next question is.

853
00:43:28,508 --> 00:43:29,748
Can you tell the name?

854
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:32,551
Then.

855
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,821
He was to have told a woman's name.

856
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:38,341
Just the first name.

857
00:43:39,461 --> 00:43:41,521
Sir Roscoe, what did she
reply to that question?

858
00:43:42,024 --> 00:43:43,399
She moaned and cried.

859
00:43:44,165 --> 00:43:45,974
'Keep on asking. Keep on asking'.

860
00:43:47,169 --> 00:43:48,727
Why didn't you do as you agreed?

861
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,707
I don't know what you're
talking about at all.

862
00:43:53,038 --> 00:43:53,825
You don't?

863
00:43:56,683 --> 00:43:57,890
Mr Wales. Sure he was.

864
00:43:58,412 --> 00:44:01,753
That a woman killed Spencer Lee and
he was sure that he found that woman.

865
00:44:02,899 --> 00:44:04,741
But he dared not accuse her.

866
00:44:05,845 --> 00:44:07,570
Or even tell me her name.

867
00:44:08,706 --> 00:44:11,199
But he knew she would be here tonight.

868
00:44:12,715 --> 00:44:14,861
He thought he could play
on her superstitious fears.

869
00:44:15,394 --> 00:44:18,267
That when her name seemingly came
from the spirit of the dead man.

870
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:20,030
She would confess.

871
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:22,877
He told Madam La Grange the name.

872
00:44:23,305 --> 00:44:24,464
You agreed to all this.

873
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,221
Why didn't you speak the name?

874
00:44:27,008 --> 00:44:28,620
I don't know anything about it.

875
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:32,784
He must have forgotten to tell it.

876
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,697
No. He didn't.

877
00:44:35,368 --> 00:44:36,498
There wasn't any name.

878
00:44:37,071 --> 00:44:40,208
He didn't tell me any name.
- You came here for that purpose.

879
00:44:40,894 --> 00:44:42,227
And after you got here.

880
00:44:43,129 --> 00:44:44,682
Something happened.

881
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,748
To make you change your plan.

882
00:44:49,566 --> 00:44:52,963
Something unexpected happened.

883
00:44:56,085 --> 00:44:59,123
Something unexpected happened.

884
00:45:00,213 --> 00:45:00,869
Now.

885
00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:02,798
What was it?

886
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:04,896
What was it?
- That is over.

887
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,325
Mrs Eastwood.

888
00:45:08,949 --> 00:45:10,564
What did you say was your first name?

889
00:45:11,187 --> 00:45:12,440
Mary.
- Mary.

890
00:45:13,553 --> 00:45:15,065
And yours?
- Grace.

891
00:45:16,399 --> 00:45:18,579
Sir Roscoe, your wife's given name?
- Alice.

892
00:45:18,973 --> 00:45:19,645
Alice.

893
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:22,945
Mrs Trent.

894
00:45:24,544 --> 00:45:25,306
Helen.

895
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:45,049
And yours, Miss O'Neill?

896
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:46,720
Helen.
- Helen?

897
00:45:47,116 --> 00:45:49,800
You see, I was christened Helen
but my friends call me 'Nellie'.

898
00:45:50,863 --> 00:45:51,857
I see.

899
00:45:54,612 --> 00:45:55,284
Helen.

900
00:45:58,087 --> 00:45:58,793
Helen.

901
00:46:00,312 --> 00:46:02,957
So there are two .. Helens.

902
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:06,605
Two.

903
00:46:07,892 --> 00:46:08,593
Helens.

904
00:46:11,246 --> 00:46:13,947
Sir Roscoe.
When Madam La Grange first came tonight.

905
00:46:14,288 --> 00:46:16,902
Did she show any surprise at
seeing any of the people here?

906
00:46:17,267 --> 00:46:18,539
I was not in the room.

907
00:46:19,073 --> 00:46:21,636
I was in the library with
Miss O'Neill and my son.

908
00:46:24,372 --> 00:46:27,239
Then Miss O'Neill was not in
the room when she arrived?

909
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,718
So there were <i>two</i> Helens.

910
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:48,006
Everything was going along smoothly
until Miss O'Neill came in.

911
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:50,721
The extra Helen.

912
00:46:52,634 --> 00:46:53,799
Rosalie La Grange.

913
00:46:55,289 --> 00:46:57,334
What is that girl to you?

914
00:46:58,332 --> 00:46:59,061
Nothing.

915
00:46:59,569 --> 00:47:01,318
Nothing at all.
- Nothing at all?

916
00:47:01,898 --> 00:47:04,564
Then why did you try to deceive
me as to where she sat?

917
00:47:05,434 --> 00:47:08,996
Why did you place her so that I wouldn't
know she was sitting next to Mr Wales ..

918
00:47:09,553 --> 00:47:10,700
When he was stabbed?

919
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:12,358
It was just a mistake.

920
00:47:12,884 --> 00:47:15,295
I didn't ask her to do it.
- I'm afraid that won't do.

921
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,771
You spoke of your plans and
the name you were to speak ..

922
00:47:19,308 --> 00:47:20,236
Was 'Helen'.

923
00:47:22,238 --> 00:47:23,717
What is the use of lying to me?

924
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,141
You tried your best to shield this girl.

925
00:47:27,581 --> 00:47:29,131
And I want to know why.

926
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:31,843
I didn't ask her to do it.

927
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,732
I never heard of the young
lady before in all my life.

928
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,747
What is that girl to you?
- Nothing.

929
00:47:38,298 --> 00:47:39,543
Nothing at all.

930
00:47:40,103 --> 00:47:42,084
You old harridan ..
- Leave my mother alone.

931
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:43,416
Leave her alone.

932
00:47:46,866 --> 00:47:48,046
I thought perhaps.

933
00:47:48,717 --> 00:47:50,087
I would get it that way.

934
00:47:50,649 --> 00:47:52,130
There, dear. It's alright.

935
00:47:53,215 --> 00:47:54,550
Of course it is alright.

936
00:47:55,126 --> 00:47:57,026
We'll have the fingerprints and ..

937
00:47:57,471 --> 00:47:59,884
If you think for one moment ..
- Richard, my boy. Please.

938
00:48:00,624 --> 00:48:01,811
Think.
- Think nothing.

939
00:48:02,122 --> 00:48:04,616
Young man .. don't be foolish.

940
00:48:06,245 --> 00:48:07,060
I am sorry.

941
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:10,371
But it is too clear.

942
00:48:10,863 --> 00:48:11,577
Clear?

943
00:48:12,073 --> 00:48:13,656
Lordy be, how could it be clear?

944
00:48:15,888 --> 00:48:18,400
You will never accuse my
little girl of a thing like that.

945
00:48:18,801 --> 00:48:20,004
She was next to him.

946
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:23,462
She had only to free one hand,
strike, and take his hand again.

947
00:48:23,873 --> 00:48:24,491
No.

948
00:48:24,812 --> 00:48:27,237
There was something else she had
to do before she could do that.

949
00:48:27,951 --> 00:48:29,587
She had to have murder in her heart.

950
00:48:30,924 --> 00:48:31,768
Look at her.

951
00:48:32,145 --> 00:48:34,438
Look at the eyes of her.
At the face of her.

952
00:48:35,249 --> 00:48:36,507
Is a murderer there?

953
00:48:37,253 --> 00:48:39,509
Man. Haven't you got eyes in your head?

954
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:41,843
No knife on them, Inspector.
- I know where it is.

955
00:48:42,167 --> 00:48:44,346
Tell the matron she will
find the knife on this girl.

956
00:48:44,732 --> 00:48:45,681
Take her away.

957
00:48:46,581 --> 00:48:47,368
Inspector.

958
00:48:47,945 --> 00:48:50,392
Don't do it.
I'll tell you anything you like.

959
00:48:50,849 --> 00:48:52,762
Only keep your hands off my little girl.

960
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:54,803
I did come here like you said.

961
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:58,158
And when I seen my own
child I lost my head.

962
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:01,162
I'm a silly old woman
that ain't got any sense.

963
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:03,281
I tried to save her.

964
00:49:03,811 --> 00:49:05,473
And I've only made matters worse.

965
00:49:06,129 --> 00:49:07,393
But you've looked at her.

966
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:10,254
You can't think she'd
do a thing like that?

967
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:11,254
Yes.

968
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:14,028
Then, Inspector. You are a fool.

969
00:49:14,473 --> 00:49:16,817
And god helping me, I'll prove it.

970
00:49:32,949 --> 00:49:33,793
No. I can't.

971
00:49:34,109 --> 00:49:36,310
I don't know why you ever allowed
this woman to come here.

972
00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:45,438
Is he still there, Howard?
- Yes.

973
00:49:46,237 --> 00:49:49,316
And I hope he takes root there.
I hope he grows like a berry tree.

974
00:49:49,644 --> 00:49:50,951
It's a beastly outrage.

975
00:49:51,308 --> 00:49:54,378
Here we are, searched and held
prisoners like common criminals.

976
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:56,471
Father.

977
00:49:56,909 --> 00:50:00,138
They searched and found nothing. Can you
insist they release her from that room?

978
00:50:00,554 --> 00:50:02,285
I'll see what I can do, Richard.
- Please.

979
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,059
Richard, where is her mother?

980
00:50:04,423 --> 00:50:08,380
I don't know. They only told me to come
in here and wait until I was wanted.

981
00:50:09,177 --> 00:50:09,878
Oh god.

982
00:50:11,028 --> 00:50:12,320
Show me the way.

983
00:50:14,416 --> 00:50:16,769
Sure, I've been a faker all my life.

984
00:50:18,046 --> 00:50:19,351
I have tricked them.

985
00:50:19,784 --> 00:50:20,928
And fooled them.

986
00:50:22,582 --> 00:50:23,397
But honest.

987
00:50:24,598 --> 00:50:27,857
I never knowingly done harm to anyone.

988
00:50:30,538 --> 00:50:32,355
And there is a power.

989
00:50:34,088 --> 00:50:35,835
It came to me before.

990
00:50:37,966 --> 00:50:38,806
Oh god.

991
00:50:40,322 --> 00:50:41,585
Give it to me again.

992
00:50:44,306 --> 00:50:45,376
It is fate.

993
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,415
My little girl.

994
00:50:50,905 --> 00:50:51,999
For the sake.

995
00:50:53,261 --> 00:50:54,749
For the sake of your son.

996
00:50:57,858 --> 00:50:58,702
Amen.

997
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:36,034
I quite understand but is it necessary
to keep her locked in that room?

998
00:51:39,386 --> 00:51:41,165
Who turned off those other lights?

999
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:43,649
I did, sir.
- Why?

1000
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,669
Well, sir.

1001
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:47,589
I was praying.

1002
00:51:48,455 --> 00:51:49,992
Praying? What for?

1003
00:51:51,864 --> 00:51:52,622
Guidance.

1004
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:54,152
I hope you get it.

1005
00:51:54,749 --> 00:51:55,610
I will, sir.

1006
00:51:56,028 --> 00:51:57,972
Take her to the matron
and have her searched.

1007
00:51:58,452 --> 00:51:59,824
Unless of course.

1008
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:02,669
You want to give up the knife now.

1009
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,360
I got no knife.

1010
00:52:04,956 --> 00:52:06,983
And I've been searched once.
- Exactly.

1011
00:52:07,721 --> 00:52:10,240
But then you were allowed
to come into this room.

1012
00:52:11,738 --> 00:52:13,743
We're rather anxious to
know what you found ..

1013
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:15,812
While you were in here.

1014
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:19,089
A feeling of comfort, sir.

1015
00:52:20,272 --> 00:52:21,770
A feeling that the innocent ..

1016
00:52:22,391 --> 00:52:23,912
Had come to no harm.

1017
00:52:25,258 --> 00:52:26,421
Take her to the matron.

1018
00:52:28,856 --> 00:52:29,957
Take her out of here.

1019
00:52:31,186 --> 00:52:32,287
I'm going.

1020
00:52:36,084 --> 00:52:38,143
You wanted me?
- Yes. Sit down.

1021
00:52:38,591 --> 00:52:40,057
My dear girl.
- Sir Roscoe.

1022
00:52:40,723 --> 00:52:42,082
If you caution her in any way.

1023
00:52:42,461 --> 00:52:44,217
You're interfering
in this investigation.

1024
00:52:44,568 --> 00:52:46,099
I beg your pardon, Inspector.

1025
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:50,041
I say, Ellis. What happened
here at the window?

1026
00:52:50,631 --> 00:52:53,538
The old woman turned the blind
and stood gazing outside.

1027
00:52:53,947 --> 00:52:56,050
Did she throw anything out the window?
- No, Inspector.

1028
00:52:57,532 --> 00:52:59,619
Now, young woman.
Let's see what you have to say.

1029
00:52:59,995 --> 00:53:02,430
I've already told you there
is nothing that I can say.

1030
00:53:02,857 --> 00:53:04,812
Well, You'd better make
up your mind to talk.

1031
00:53:05,245 --> 00:53:06,826
Now. Out with the truth.

1032
00:53:07,342 --> 00:53:08,644
She will 'out' with nothing.

1033
00:53:10,544 --> 00:53:14,291
You say you got the fingerprints of the
girl that was in Spencer Lee's room.

1034
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:16,718
And you got my Nellie's fingerprints.

1035
00:53:17,479 --> 00:53:19,235
Why don't you compare them?
- Mother.

1036
00:53:19,811 --> 00:53:21,558
What were you going to say?
- Nothing.

1037
00:53:21,979 --> 00:53:22,859
Inspector.

1038
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:26,057
The fingerprints compare perfectly.
- That is a lie.

1039
00:53:26,465 --> 00:53:28,654
Sir Roscoe, we have taken this
young woman's fingerprints.

1040
00:53:29,654 --> 00:53:31,897
And there is the cup which we
took from Spencer Lee's room.

1041
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,586
Her fingerprints are on that cup.

1042
00:53:35,937 --> 00:53:37,257
I never touched a cup.

1043
00:53:38,573 --> 00:53:39,437
Thanks.

1044
00:53:41,441 --> 00:53:42,724
I know that fact.

1045
00:53:43,229 --> 00:53:44,872
Then you said that just to trap her?

1046
00:53:45,242 --> 00:53:47,444
There are no fingerprints on the cup.

1047
00:53:48,509 --> 00:53:50,010
We merely wanted her admission.

1048
00:53:50,736 --> 00:53:51,891
She was there.

1049
00:53:56,546 --> 00:53:57,247
Nellie.

1050
00:53:58,142 --> 00:53:58,957
Look at me.

1051
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:02,387
Look at your old mother.

1052
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:04,601
Mother.

1053
00:54:06,862 --> 00:54:08,255
What if she did go there?

1054
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,158
She had a good reason for it.

1055
00:54:11,488 --> 00:54:13,319
What did you go for, darling?

1056
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:15,449
I can't tell you.

1057
00:54:16,693 --> 00:54:18,250
Nellie, dear. You must tell me.

1058
00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:21,672
Dear, listen.

1059
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,503
You know that I trust you.

1060
00:54:24,041 --> 00:54:25,400
You know that we all love you.

1061
00:54:26,243 --> 00:54:27,756
Now explain to him, dear.

1062
00:54:28,341 --> 00:54:28,985
Well?

1063
00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:30,763
I'm waiting.

1064
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:32,184
I didn't do anything.

1065
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:33,816
I didn't do anything.

1066
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:36,815
Yes, my dear. We know that.
But why did you go?

1067
00:54:37,214 --> 00:54:38,935
Did you know Spencer Lee?

1068
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:40,786
Of course she didn't, father.

1069
00:54:41,126 --> 00:54:42,608
Why doesn't she speak for herself?

1070
00:54:42,919 --> 00:54:44,192
Because I'll speak for her.

1071
00:54:44,652 --> 00:54:46,864
My dear, can't you answer
even that question?

1072
00:54:47,933 --> 00:54:49,778
Don't you see what they'll
think if you don't?

1073
00:54:50,136 --> 00:54:51,393
Nellie, you must tell me.

1074
00:54:52,045 --> 00:54:52,746
Nellie.

1075
00:54:53,325 --> 00:54:55,108
You're shielding someone.
- No, no.

1076
00:54:55,528 --> 00:54:57,338
That's the first lie you ever told me.

1077
00:54:58,130 --> 00:54:59,936
I want to know who you are shielding.

1078
00:55:00,614 --> 00:55:02,361
Tell me who it is.
- Please dear.

1079
00:55:03,157 --> 00:55:05,195
You're her sweetheart. Make her tell.

1080
00:55:05,512 --> 00:55:08,004
Dear, you must. You must.
- Richard, I can't.

1081
00:55:09,485 --> 00:55:11,731
Even if you are protecting someone else.

1082
00:55:12,296 --> 00:55:13,692
I think you ought to tell us.

1083
00:55:14,466 --> 00:55:15,598
Break her word, is it?

1084
00:55:16,176 --> 00:55:17,106
She should not.

1085
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,192
There never was an O'Neill
yet that was an informer.

1086
00:55:22,868 --> 00:55:24,098
She needn't tell.

1087
00:55:24,825 --> 00:55:26,344
I know it myself now.

1088
00:55:27,146 --> 00:55:28,669
It is blind, I've been.

1089
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:31,652
You.

1090
00:55:44,739 --> 00:55:47,531
You're the one who found
out there was two Helens.

1091
00:55:48,281 --> 00:55:50,321
'The extra Helen', says you.

1092
00:55:51,163 --> 00:55:53,165
Well, send for the other Helen.

1093
00:55:53,633 --> 00:55:54,963
And ask her.
- Mother, stop.

1094
00:55:55,345 --> 00:55:56,332
Stop? I will not.

1095
00:55:56,648 --> 00:55:57,520
Wait, please.

1096
00:55:58,641 --> 00:55:59,857
Did my daughter send you?

1097
00:56:00,493 --> 00:56:02,856
Because if she did we
can't accept that sacrifice.

1098
00:56:04,139 --> 00:56:05,647
I want to know the truth.

1099
00:56:06,987 --> 00:56:08,458
Did my daughter send you?

1100
00:56:09,859 --> 00:56:11,375
Did you go for my daughter?

1101
00:56:12,281 --> 00:56:12,896
Yes.

1102
00:56:13,266 --> 00:56:14,052
I knew it.

1103
00:56:14,557 --> 00:56:15,974
My daughter sent you?

1104
00:56:17,232 --> 00:56:18,159
What for?

1105
00:56:18,746 --> 00:56:20,261
Some letters.
- Why didn't she go?

1106
00:56:20,578 --> 00:56:22,151
She was afraid.
- Go on.

1107
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,080
Tell him, dear. It's alright.

1108
00:56:24,588 --> 00:56:25,975
I don't know what to say.

1109
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:27,618
Why not tell the truth?

1110
00:56:28,369 --> 00:56:30,154
Tell the inspector what happened.

1111
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:33,509
Nothing happened.

1112
00:56:35,556 --> 00:56:40,300
They were silly letters Helen wrote to
Mr Lee before she married Mr Trent.

1113
00:56:42,475 --> 00:56:43,204
You see.

1114
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,637
Mr Lee knew that Mr Trent
was terribly jealous, and ..

1115
00:56:47,494 --> 00:56:50,571
He threatened to send the letters to
him if Helen didn't come to his room.

1116
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:55,308
Helen confided in me
and I went to Mr Lee.

1117
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:58,747
He said that he loved
Helen and was desperate.

1118
00:56:59,696 --> 00:57:01,490
It seemed like a funny kind of love.

1119
00:57:02,068 --> 00:57:03,341
But I didn't tell him that.

1120
00:57:03,944 --> 00:57:05,420
Then he gave me the letters.

1121
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:07,970
Was it before or after
Mr Lee ordered tea?

1122
00:57:08,322 --> 00:57:09,128
After.

1123
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,227
I compliment this young lady.

1124
00:57:12,413 --> 00:57:13,464
That was ..

1125
00:57:14,133 --> 00:57:15,595
Beautifully done.

1126
00:57:16,252 --> 00:57:18,011
Grimshaw, get Miss Trent.
- Yes, Inspector.

1127
00:57:18,388 --> 00:57:19,833
You don't believe?
- Not a word.

1128
00:57:20,217 --> 00:57:21,335
Not one word.

1129
00:57:21,959 --> 00:57:23,445
She wasn't protecting your sister.

1130
00:57:23,896 --> 00:57:25,438
She was protecting herself.

1131
00:57:26,716 --> 00:57:28,230
She went for the letters of course.

1132
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:30,623
But the tea was served
before she asked for them.

1133
00:57:30,988 --> 00:57:32,796
Not afterwards.
- How do you know that?

1134
00:57:33,169 --> 00:57:36,016
The butler would not serve tea
to a man she had just killed.

1135
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:37,476
You ..
- Richard.

1136
00:57:37,729 --> 00:57:38,918
She was engaged to him.

1137
00:57:39,866 --> 00:57:42,056
He had compromising letters
she had written to him.

1138
00:57:42,543 --> 00:57:44,057
So she went to get them.

1139
00:57:44,783 --> 00:57:47,022
Then, when he wouldn't give them to her.

1140
00:57:47,478 --> 00:57:48,443
She killed him.

1141
00:57:49,207 --> 00:57:50,044
Mrs Trent.

1142
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:51,220
Yes, Inspector?

1143
00:57:51,825 --> 00:57:55,707
Did you ask this girl to go to Mr Lee's
rooms to get letters you wrote to him?

1144
00:57:56,095 --> 00:57:57,112
Did she what?

1145
00:57:57,511 --> 00:57:59,041
Did you, Mrs Trent?

1146
00:58:00,458 --> 00:58:01,551
Certainly not.

1147
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:03,724
Helen, I ..
- Keep still.

1148
00:58:05,534 --> 00:58:08,007
Are you sure?
- Of course she is sure.

1149
00:58:08,804 --> 00:58:10,149
Please answer my question.

1150
00:58:11,716 --> 00:58:13,994
I never wrote a letter to
Spencer Lee in my life.

1151
00:58:15,626 --> 00:58:18,056
I don't know what she told you.
- Never mind what she told me.

1152
00:58:18,385 --> 00:58:20,041
I want to be very sure of this.

1153
00:58:21,367 --> 00:58:23,918
Did you ask this girl to
go to Spencer Lee's room?

1154
00:58:24,482 --> 00:58:25,121
No.

1155
00:58:25,976 --> 00:58:27,544
She had no letters of yours?
- No.

1156
00:58:27,934 --> 00:58:29,486
Nellie didn't know Lee, Helen.

1157
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:31,879
And you did.
- How about that, Mrs Trent?

1158
00:58:33,182 --> 00:58:34,926
I think Nellie knew Spencer Lee.

1159
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,587
I hadn't seen him for months.

1160
00:58:38,327 --> 00:58:39,797
He used to come here a good deal.

1161
00:58:40,693 --> 00:58:41,823
He wanted to marry me.

1162
00:58:42,801 --> 00:58:43,931
But I didn't like him.

1163
00:58:45,075 --> 00:58:47,633
And I certainly never wrote
him letters of any sort.

1164
00:58:48,443 --> 00:58:50,056
Thank you, Mrs Trent.

1165
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:53,779
That is all I want to know.

1166
00:58:54,184 --> 00:58:56,552
Helen, you're lying to save yourself.
You must tell the truth.

1167
00:58:56,806 --> 00:58:58,279
She tells the truth.
- She's not.

1168
00:58:58,572 --> 00:58:59,737
Richard, wait.

1169
00:59:00,641 --> 00:59:01,342
Please.

1170
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,098
I'm sorry, Richard.

1171
00:59:04,427 --> 00:59:06,671
Father, you don't think ..
- No, dear. I don't.

1172
00:59:08,101 --> 00:59:10,662
Inspector, do you need us anymore?
- Not anymore.

1173
00:59:11,237 --> 00:59:12,212
Thank you.

1174
00:59:14,831 --> 00:59:15,589
Grimshaw.

1175
00:59:16,299 --> 00:59:17,750
Take her to police headquarters.

1176
00:59:18,126 --> 00:59:19,547
No. Not my Nellie.

1177
00:59:20,168 --> 00:59:20,955
Inspector.

1178
00:59:21,277 --> 00:59:22,693
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

1179
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,532
I know who done it.
- You know? Who was it?

1180
00:59:26,019 --> 00:59:28,544
I can't tell you yet.
But I will, I will.

1181
00:59:29,272 --> 00:59:30,312
Give me a chance.

1182
00:59:30,653 --> 00:59:31,674
Give me time.

1183
00:59:32,132 --> 00:59:33,095
Give me an hour.

1184
00:59:33,835 --> 00:59:35,674
Keep them all here in the house.

1185
00:59:36,202 --> 00:59:37,218
An hour more.

1186
00:59:40,715 --> 00:59:41,749
I'll give you.

1187
00:59:42,758 --> 00:59:43,723
Ten minutes.

1188
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,404
Ten minutes?

1189
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:49,289
Bless me.

1190
00:59:49,748 --> 00:59:51,638
No, darling. Not now. Go away.

1191
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,388
Inspector, won't you take them all away?

1192
00:59:56,386 --> 00:59:57,574
Please.
- Alright.

1193
00:59:58,165 --> 00:59:59,432
Go away please.
- Come.

1194
01:00:01,158 --> 01:00:02,037
Ten minutes.

1195
01:00:04,555 --> 01:00:05,456
What can I do?

1196
01:00:06,396 --> 01:00:07,394
What can I do?

1197
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:13,144
I said I knew who done it.

1198
01:00:13,965 --> 01:00:14,809
But I don't.

1199
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,690
Sure, Laughing-Eyes.

1200
01:00:20,196 --> 01:00:21,846
You're no good to me now.

1201
01:00:23,337 --> 01:00:24,711
We've faked all our lives.

1202
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:28,176
Now, when I want the real thing.

1203
01:00:30,389 --> 01:00:31,982
I get nothing at all.

1204
01:00:35,015 --> 01:00:36,601
If only I could get ..

1205
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,738
A real message.

1206
01:00:41,416 --> 01:00:42,446
Laughing-Eyes.

1207
01:00:44,275 --> 01:00:45,273
Laughing-Eyes.

1208
01:00:46,994 --> 01:00:49,095
Are you going to let me be beaten?

1209
01:00:50,227 --> 01:00:51,362
By a scheming ..

1210
01:00:52,184 --> 01:00:54,145
Cold-hearted murderer?

1211
01:00:54,865 --> 01:00:56,426
[ Two raps. ]

1212
01:01:04,716 --> 01:01:05,958
I didn't do that.

1213
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:11,519
I didn't do that.

1214
01:01:14,009 --> 01:01:14,931
It's come.

1215
01:01:16,492 --> 01:01:18,418
After all these years.

1216
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:21,146
A real message.

1217
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:24,444
I will take it.

1218
01:01:25,419 --> 01:01:26,232
Believing.

1219
01:01:26,769 --> 01:01:27,930
And trusting.

1220
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:30,588
The time to be sure.

1221
01:01:38,291 --> 01:01:39,453
Glory be.

1222
01:01:41,015 --> 01:01:41,951
The knife.

1223
01:01:46,561 --> 01:01:47,564
I knocked twice.

1224
01:01:47,948 --> 01:01:49,131
But you didn't hear me.

1225
01:01:50,968 --> 01:01:52,186
I heard you.

1226
01:01:55,231 --> 01:01:56,504
That was a message.

1227
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:58,885
Just the same.

1228
01:02:03,497 --> 01:02:04,410
Inspector.

1229
01:02:05,114 --> 01:02:06,612
I got to speak to you alone.

1230
01:02:07,282 --> 01:02:08,066
I got to.

1231
01:02:09,415 --> 01:02:10,746
You must let me.

1232
01:02:12,133 --> 01:02:13,434
You've got to let me.

1233
01:02:14,651 --> 01:02:15,612
Very well.

1234
01:02:20,847 --> 01:02:22,455
The constable outside is ordered ..

1235
01:02:23,265 --> 01:02:25,572
To arrest anyone leaving this house.

1236
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,408
What did mother mean, Richard?
What did she mean, 'a message'?

1237
01:02:31,578 --> 01:02:32,716
I don't know, dear.

1238
01:02:33,388 --> 01:02:34,089
Please.

1239
01:02:34,729 --> 01:02:35,893
Please, Inspector.

1240
01:02:36,577 --> 01:02:37,676
Do as I ask.

1241
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:40,112
Give me a chance.

1242
01:02:41,528 --> 01:02:43,193
Then, if it does work.

1243
01:02:43,582 --> 01:02:45,392
You can take my Nellie and lock her up.

1244
01:02:46,876 --> 01:02:47,917
Please, Inspector.

1245
01:02:48,814 --> 01:02:50,293
I know my Nellie will do it.

1246
01:02:51,028 --> 01:02:52,799
Let's see if the other one will.

1247
01:02:53,461 --> 01:02:55,257
What you are asking me to let you do ..

1248
01:02:55,976 --> 01:02:57,019
Is insanity.

1249
01:02:58,139 --> 01:02:59,274
It is unheard of.

1250
01:03:00,296 --> 01:03:01,624
Inspector, please.

1251
01:03:02,499 --> 01:03:03,755
Don't you see?

1252
01:03:04,222 --> 01:03:05,237
I am drowning.

I hope you will.

Grimshaw, go with Madam La Grange
and do what she tells you.

1256
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:19,247
You can't mean it, Inspector.
What she asks is too horrible.

1257
01:03:19,669 --> 01:03:20,686

You will bring them right along?
- Yes.

Can we all go now?
- You shall not.

1265
01:04:05,462 --> 01:04:07,528
I must ask everyone to
return to the other room.

1266
01:04:08,017 --> 01:04:09,837
Look here, you have the guilty party.

1267
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:12,917
Is there no end to this red tape?
- Thank you, Mr Trent.

1268
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:16,577
Your assurance that I have the
guilty party gives me a great relief.

1269
01:04:17,207 --> 01:04:18,308
Will you come please?

1270
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:28,857
I guess that's alright?
- Yes, sir. That is alright.

1271
01:04:29,353 --> 01:04:30,415
Don't be worried.

We should refuse to continue
with this tomfoolery.

I think this is a beastly outrage.
Sir Roscoe, must we continue with this?

1279
01:05:08,444 --> 01:05:11,319
Inspector, is this necessary?
- Quite necessary.

1280
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:19,501
Mr Standish, your demonstration
is unnecessary.

Inspector, this is a little too much.
It's too much.

could get the message from Spencer Lee.

desk and I stabbed him.
