1
00:00:00,762 --> 00:00:03,283
"The Ball"

2
00:01:19,192 --> 00:01:22,093
I am mayor of the city of Horn.

3
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:24,447
Hans Rasch.

4
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:38,487
Er. Yes, it's carnival season now,

5
00:01:39,028 --> 00:01:47,165
that's the only time of the year
that happiness and laughter prevail.

6
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:53,622
Laughing is healthy, people are doing
serious labor day in, day out.

7
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:57,906
So they shall be happy once a year.

8
00:01:58,615 --> 00:02:02,347
And that is why I welcome the carnival season.

9
00:02:08,064 --> 00:02:11,783
I like going to the ball,
because I am always glad

10
00:02:12,283 --> 00:02:18,626
to meet good friends with
whom I can be funny.

11
00:02:18,697 --> 00:02:24,158
I have a lot of work all year,
lots of trouble.

12
00:02:24,705 --> 00:02:28,984
And laughing sets people free.

13
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,173
Please be careful now.
This is delicate.

14
00:03:39,173 --> 00:03:41,660
We must cooperate now,
or else it will go wrong.

15
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,439
If we are to the front,
or relatively far to the front,

16
00:03:46,707 --> 00:03:48,863
a bit further up front than now,
yes, mind the distances

17
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:50,771
when we are an little bit
more to the front than now,

18
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:55,320
the ladies shake hands, yes, so we
have a slight cohesion between the rows ...

19
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:03,196
I am the director of the Federal
Secondary School Horn.

20
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:07,773
My name: Privy councilor Otto Mayer.

21
00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:13,993
My attitude towards the
Horner students' ball is positive.

22
00:04:14,493 --> 00:04:18,812
I welcome the realization
of this traditional ball,

23
00:04:19,312 --> 00:04:25,362
a youth celebration ball that's a
highlight of the Carnival of Horner.

24
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:31,538
Its uniqueness lies in the party
and the whole ambiance.

25
00:04:31,808 --> 00:04:35,908
The opening polonaise of the
committee of the bachelors

26
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,906
and bachelorettes is magisterially
conducted by Prof. Hagel.

27
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:43,416
It always constitutes the
festive prelude to the festival.

28
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:49,287
In this ambiance,
it is understandable that

29
00:04:49,574 --> 00:04:56,229
that for the Horner youth in general,
this is the first ball they visit.

30
00:04:56,681 --> 00:05:02,333
What is more, the Horner
ball is a stomping ground

31
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,193
for former students,
even whole classes.

32
00:05:06,912 --> 00:05:14,063
This needs to be so,
sooo precise, that they,

33
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,721
Reagan and his cronies
would lick their fingers.

34
00:05:19,765 --> 00:05:20,897
It needs to be very precise.

35
00:05:21,397 --> 00:05:24,244
And over there the gentlemen, please:

36
00:05:24,744 --> 00:05:30,214
everyone pulls a lady, aren't they
young, lean, feather weighty beings.

37
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:34,237
It's no hardship.

38
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,825
Some do as with a piece of furniture,
pull it around, don't they?

39
00:05:39,702 --> 00:05:43,244
I personally visit the ball
usually in tandem

40
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:51,071
with my wife and we always enjoy
the colorful image of the youth.

41
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:57,149
We're pleased to chat when we dance,

42
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:06,889
so to me it's also a highlight
of the Carnival of Horner.

43
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:37,558
My name is Dr. Heinz Sommer.

44
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:46,329
I've been at the Federal High School
since 1967 as a school doctor.

45
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:52,354
Regarding the ball; the upcoming one,
I'd like to make the following statement:

46
00:06:52,854 --> 00:06:56,098
I'm always pleased to
participate in a student ball,

47
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:01,742
since I do have the opportunity
to see what has become of them,

48
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:07,559
the students that left school,
what professions they took.

49
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:14,714
And also the happiness of the youth
to participate in this event here.

50
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:21,732
There is always a casual,
relaxed companionship.

51
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:27,367
And for me as an senior,
it's always very enjoyable

52
00:07:27,384 --> 00:07:32,324
to participate in this event
with the youth.

53
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:53,346
My name is Dr. Franz Hochhinaus.

54
00:07:53,846 --> 00:07:57,350
I am a lawyer here in Horn,
in Lower Austria, in the Forrest District.

55
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,733
As you know Horn is a small town,

56
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:05,790
notably a school city with a secondary
school and a high school.

57
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:11,235
I am also chairman of the Parents'
Association of the secondary school in Horn.

58
00:08:11,632 --> 00:08:14,846
As such, I especially like
to visit the students' ball.

59
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,931
Now for the question:
Why go to a small town to a ball?

60
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:27,291
I think it's essential to
distinguish why people go to balls

61
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,171
in cities and why in a small town,
where you know each other.

62
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:39,281
The ball as a social event
facilitates being together,

63
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:45,465
I would say, and not any, for any
other reason, as it might be the case

64
00:08:45,965 --> 00:08:51,740
in a big city, where you
go to see and be seen.

65
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:35,870
Song: "Gonna Take A Sentimental Journey"

66
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:46,775
Yes, this is my first ball

67
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:51,955
and I want it to be a kind of romantic event.

68
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:56,264
But not as one used to say,

69
00:09:56,583 --> 00:10:02,380
more like "High Society",
but we dance polonaise,

70
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,655
because I think that this should
be an unforgettable event for me.

71
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:46,458
All women will look around
at what whom is wearing

72
00:10:46,543 --> 00:10:49,035
and how often they have already
been wearing it and whether

73
00:10:49,535 --> 00:10:51,285
they go with the same dress
for two or three years.

74
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:55,496
No matter at what table,
everybody comments.

75
00:10:56,165 --> 00:11:00,896
In any case it's being discussed
who flirts with whom.

76
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:26,155
Yes, after all, my business
is specifically aimed at women

77
00:11:26,628 --> 00:11:28,825
and I can imagine, that I,
if I get a man to dance at the ball,

78
00:11:28,385 --> 00:11:32,497
and the lady is sitting next to me,

79
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:37,100
and might be a customer of mine,
she probably won't be too pleased.

80
00:12:02,092 --> 00:12:04,613
Is it pleasing? Very subtle. Yes.

81
00:12:05,409 --> 00:12:11,979
You only need to change the dress
and you can go dancing. Thank you.

82
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:31,651
Song: "... Sentimental Journey ..."

83
00:12:46,496 --> 00:12:50,337
Well, I like to go to the ball,
so, because I, I go to the ball

84
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:53,639
because I like to have a chat,
because I like to dance.

85
00:12:54,099 --> 00:13:01,349
And I, so if I'm there,
I dance with everyone,

86
00:13:01,808 --> 00:13:04,743
so, who asks me.
I don't care, whether I,

87
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:11,264
whether he's a child of
a professor's or a doctor,

88
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:14,936
or whether he descends
from a worker's family.

89
00:13:15,436 --> 00:13:19,126
So, unlike others,
I know some that say,

90
00:13:19,626 --> 00:13:22,158
I'm not gonna dance with
this or that guy,

91
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:27,144
so to me it doesn't matter.
So, I want to just enjoy it.

92
00:13:27,644 --> 00:13:31,100
And hope that I can dance,
with whom asks me to,

93
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,709
I hope it's just a lot of dancing.

94
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:40,991
Song: "... Seven, that's the time we leave ..."

95
00:14:57,371 --> 00:15:01,380
Yes, that is a fact that bothers
me quite a bit at a ball.

96
00:15:02,397 --> 00:15:06,557
One experiences, well actually
you'll experience it anywhere, that...

97
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:10,267
that there are sometimes women,
especially women,

98
00:15:10,707 --> 00:15:15,488
who don't quite know how to
actually dress for a festive ball.

99
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:20,185
There are those that race around in rags.

100
00:15:20,685 --> 00:15:24,985
That are supposed to be
something of a dress.

101
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:32,356
That is, thrown around towels,

102
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:40,255
and then, well, I think ladies
should observe certain rules.

103
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,246
Well why I go to a ball.

104
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:53,618
I try to do at a ball
what I like to do: namely dance.

105
00:15:54,406 --> 00:16:00,349
And to meet friends.
And to get to know them privately,

106
00:16:00,404 --> 00:16:02,215
which is easily possible at the ball.

107
00:16:02,406 --> 00:16:06,546
And above all I am very
happy to go dancing.

108
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:10,916
While you're dancing you only
have to watch out what you do,

109
00:16:10,954 --> 00:16:14,040
what you say, how you go,
how you stand,

110
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,295
and especially how long you
dance with a particular person,

111
00:16:17,747 --> 00:16:20,868
without somebody else seeing it.

112
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:24,411
It's impossible to dance all night
with somebody you like to dance with,

113
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:29,498
because you meet the people
from the ball all year through.

114
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:37,256
And, yes, you've got to stand it
and it is not just pleasant,

115
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:43,117
if you hear that he dates her,
well, still and again ...

116
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:51,162
And I try to solve this by
dancing with other men also

117
00:16:51,586 --> 00:16:59,242
And, uh, I nonetheless like
to go to the ball, to dance;

118
00:16:59,742 --> 00:17:02,843
also to dance with others.

119
00:18:03,358 --> 00:18:06,919
Song: "Take my lips ..."

120
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:22,823
I go to the ball to dance,

121
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:28,231
since I can dance here with like-minded,
with people who also like to dance.

122
00:18:29,305 --> 00:18:31,595
And I love to dance,

123
00:18:31,805 --> 00:18:36,634
that I may be a bit of an actor,
a bit in the limelight,

124
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:43,307
to be as I want to be,
which is very rare.

125
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:51,120
The climax of the ball is
to me the polonaise,

126
00:18:51,253 --> 00:18:55,519
because then I can be best actor,
dance the most,

127
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:58,603
I'm very much in the limelight then.

128
00:19:36,548 --> 00:19:41,714
A coat? 40 Austrian Schillings.

129
00:20:05,388 --> 00:20:15,368
-Two, please!
-2 adults? 160

130
00:20:16,905 --> 00:20:18,714
- Do you have a tenner?

131
00:20:31,091 --> 00:20:37,628
Well, I would not go alone to a ball,
no. I'd never do that.

132
00:20:38,055 --> 00:20:42,505
I don't know, it feels odd.
I wouldn't know where to sit.

133
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:47,451
Almost everybody is in pairs.
Even in circles, they are always 2,4,6,8

134
00:20:47,841 --> 00:20:51,616
always double;
one would feel superfluous,

135
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:55,138
to sit at a table as seventh
or ninth, or as a fifth,

136
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,991
nobody's gonna pick you up. There must
always be a couple to remain seated.

137
00:20:58,246 --> 00:21:01,470
If you're a circle of five at a ball

138
00:21:01,698 --> 00:21:05,811
there will never four of them be
dancing at once, but only two.

139
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:09,226
The other two would not dare to,
because they think

140
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:16,082
they need to remain seated,
since they included me as a fifth person.

141
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:28,440
Well, I think that men
also have opportunities

142
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:40,317
to shape their bodies and to
manifest their inner expression.

143
00:21:41,806 --> 00:21:44,062
There is the possibility
to wear a vest or none.

144
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:47,814
And there is the possibility
of a black or a red bow tie.

145
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:53,603
A very black or a
rather dark gray one.

146
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:50,107
A pin-striped suit or none.

147
00:21:55,049 --> 00:22:00,859
And there is the possibility
of choosing the shirt.

148
00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:21,289
- Keep still!
- Scandale Grande!

149
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:05,166
- Cheese!
- Smile, smile, baby.

150
00:23:18,268 --> 00:23:24,294
Well, if I find somebody
to push me right,

151
00:23:24,956 --> 00:23:29,336
push me politically, then I
might be able to...

152
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:34,187
enter the clique of
the Opera Ball dancers.

153
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:04,355
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I thank you very warmly for your applause

154
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:07,712
for the opening by the committee
of the bachelors and bachelorettes

155
00:26:07,786 --> 00:26:11,537
and now ask the Director of the
Federal Secondary Schools of Horner,

156
00:26:11,977 --> 00:26:15,127
privy councilor Otto Meyer
to open the ball.

157
00:26:16,935 --> 00:26:18,854
Distinguished guests.

158
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:23,345
Dear youth. First, I'd like
to express my joy

159
00:26:23,551 --> 00:26:32,336
about this year's numerous
followings of our invitation to our ball.

160
00:26:32,753 --> 00:26:37,704
With exceptional pleasure
I welcome the patrons of our ball,

161
00:26:38,204 --> 00:26:41,932
the members of the
Lower Austrian Landtag,

162
00:26:42,432 --> 00:26:46,039
Kurt Puchinger and
economist John Steinböck.

163
00:26:53,093 --> 00:26:58,843
I also warmly welcome Dr. Wagner
from the District Commission Horn,

164
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:02,289
who comes in place of
the deputy district chief.

165
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:11,847
We are particularly pleased,
that our dear Mr. Mayor, councilor

166
00:27:12,347 --> 00:27:15,804
Hans Rasch, is in our midst today.

167
00:27:22,346 --> 00:27:29,440
To you, and to you all,
I wish a beautiful, fun ball night.

168
00:27:30,085 --> 00:27:33,781
And to our organizer,
the successful volleyball team

169
00:27:34,281 --> 00:27:39,590
under the leadership of Professor
Pavlicek, I not only thank,

170
00:27:39,848 --> 00:27:43,942
but also wish a financially
successful night.

171
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:56,131
In this sense and in the hope
that all my wishes come true,

172
00:27:56,583 --> 00:28:03,945
I open the the ball of the Horner
Federal Secondary Schools of 1982.

173
00:28:15,714 --> 00:28:17,910
And!

174
00:28:19,314 --> 00:28:20,740
And!

175
00:28:29,696 --> 00:28:32,648
The sound was good ... Hahaha!

176
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:09,318
So to me a ball is a success,

177
00:29:10,585 --> 00:29:17,205
when I more or less danced 
with all the other polonaise ladies. 

178
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:28,375
And then from midnight danced 
with all the ladies that lie in my heart. 

179
00:29:29,337 --> 00:29:34,893
Well, that's women who 
dance relatively well. 

180
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:42,582
Or, ladies, I just know, who 
thereby are seated to other tables, 

181
00:29:42,979 --> 00:29:45,179
and they are invited to dance, 

182
00:29:46,977 --> 00:29:51,610
and then you chance it 
whether you dance in step. 

183
00:29:51,837 --> 00:29:54,207
And if the first dance passes off

184
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:59,198
more or less without complaint 
then you continue dancing some more. 

185
00:30:10,296 --> 00:30:15,779
If you'll give me the opportunity 
to address the questions asked, 

186
00:30:16,828 --> 00:30:21,258
I must first introduce myself: 
my name is Dr. Richard Straub, 

187
00:30:21,307 --> 00:30:25,249
lawyer by profession in Horn, 
in my political function,

188
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:27,329
I am vice-mayor. 

189
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:32,372
I suppose this function is the 
primary reason for your visit. 

190
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:38,085
Now to your questions: my comment 
on the ball happening in Horn, 

191
00:30:38,585 --> 00:30:41,712
respectively the importance
of the ball in Horn. 

192
00:30:42,087 --> 00:30:46,518
This question I must answer 
from two viewpoints.

193
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:50,719
Once again from my 
position of vice-mayor, 

194
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:55,083
and then the importance 
I personally attribute to the ball. 

195
00:30:56,714 --> 00:31:02,293
I consider the ball to be very 
essential for the town of Horn, 

196
00:31:02,603 --> 00:31:06,895
to be very important from the social 
point of view, from the cultural standpoint,

197
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:12,032
from an economic standpoint, etc. 

198
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:18,840
Since television crept into the families, 

199
00:31:19,235 --> 00:31:22,943
and predominates leisure time at home, 

200
00:31:23,356 --> 00:31:30,027
social life in small towns 
faded into the background

201
00:31:30,196 --> 00:31:34,815
So it is very welcome and beneficial, 
especially during carnival

202
00:31:35,315 --> 00:31:41,746
but also throughout the year 
if any kind of social events take place. 

203
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:44,260
To the ball itself - 

204
00:31:47,168 --> 00:31:54,925
Singing voice: "In the party. In the party. 
My father was in the party. 

205
00:31:55,425 --> 00:32:01,233
My mother was in the party. 
My brother was in the party,

206
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:07,110
my sister was in the party... " 

207
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:27,512
It's always very embarrassing 
if a woman has to turn men down. 

208
00:32:27,933 --> 00:32:34,118
People then might say she's arrogant, 
or snooty, or something like that,

209
00:32:34,596 --> 00:32:38,448
so it's easy for a man to 
relieve her from that choice,  

210
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:44,214
to say "no" or "later" or "no, thanks". 

211
00:32:44,264 --> 00:32:50,112
These are decisions I have to relieve her from. 

212
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:55,219
Since I'm supposed to know my partner

213
00:32:55,607 --> 00:33:01,498
I should know which men 
she dislikes, might be interested in 

214
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:05,304
for professional or business reasons, 

215
00:33:06,176 --> 00:33:09,905
or thinks to be completely uninteresting. 

216
00:33:10,127 --> 00:33:14,519
And relieve her from saying 'no', 

217
00:33:15,049 --> 00:33:17,169
thank God man can decide that.

218
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:24,430
I also tell myself that it was not 
the woman who turned me down, 

219
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:28,637
but her partner, 
who thinks I'm too handsome. 

220
00:33:28,933 --> 00:33:37,772
But probably his lady would like me.
 It's not like the woman turns you down directly.

221
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,518
So, I repeat the announcement: 

222
00:33:47,974 --> 00:33:51,752
from half past ten cards, slips of paper 
are handed out with hearts on them. 

223
00:33:51,987 --> 00:33:57,198
Whoever has the most hearts 
and slips is queen of the ball. 

224
00:34:56,072 --> 00:35:01,097
There are ladies wearing bright red gloves 
and keeping their hands quite far up,

225
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:03,267
so they are particularly noticeable.

226
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:07,644
They of course engage a lot of attention. 

227
00:35:43,613 --> 00:35:48,879
The ball in a small town is a representative event. 

228
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:56,694
And as a professor of the local school 
I enjoy that the youth is taking an active part. 

229
00:35:57,194 --> 00:36:00,539
The only danger is that, 
and I now speak as a psychologist, 

230
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:07,500
that there may be a little "ball shock" 
with girls not being picked up for a while. 

231
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,209
Lots of them come to the ball as couples already, 
and if a young man doesn't find somebody,

232
00:36:13,709 --> 00:36:21,757
and in his solitude gets carried away a little, 
that could be a certain danger, no?

233
00:36:21,778 --> 00:36:25,751
Apart from that the ball is
always very well attended, 

234
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,953
many graduates come, 
and then it's always very nice. 

235
00:37:01,876 --> 00:37:05,572
Song: "Let's dance Charleston ..." 

236
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:30,136
Now you imagine, that it pleased 
us at that time in our youth, 

237
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:39,707
to raise a lady's ball gown up to the ruff to potter 
around underneath it in this stuffy, hot atmosphere.

238
00:37:39,752 --> 00:37:45,699
- Where it is probably as wet as out here. 
- Well, we didn't get that far back then. 

239
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:44,607
Song: "He who was born in April, 
get up, get up ... drink up ... " 

240
00:39:16,248 --> 00:39:17,992
My name is Peter Berger. 

241
00:39:18,448 --> 00:39:21,967
I am a shareholder of the 
Printing Company Berger. 

242
00:39:22,565 --> 00:39:27,389
We employ 200 people. 
Incidentally, I am a councilor in Horn. 

243
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:35,704
For me, a ball in the countryside 
is an ideal means of communication. 

244
00:39:36,172 --> 00:39:42,016
You get to know people you've 
only seen passing on the street. 

245
00:39:42,459 --> 00:39:45,994
You can participate in conversations 
in a relaxed atmosphere. 

246
00:39:46,494 --> 00:39:52,547
One gets to know people, 
their problems, their attitude. 

247
00:39:53,047 --> 00:40:01,017
And I personally go to 
Horner balls to get entertained. 

248
00:40:01,328 --> 00:40:05,811
To spend a harmonious evening with my wife 

249
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:13,669
and if it ends different than planned, 
by making a new acquaintance, 

250
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:22,547
then it is surely the end 
of a successful evening ball. 

251
00:40:42,626 --> 00:40:47,148
Song: "drink up, drink up, drink up ..." 

252
00:44:27,882 --> 00:44:33,659
My name is Dr. Robert Seiner.
I am a notary by profession. 

253
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:40,503
And the umpire of OEVP Balls. 

254
00:44:42,481 --> 00:44:52,575
Today as any year the ball 
of the ÖVP Horn takes place. 

255
00:44:52,605 --> 00:45:06,198
The ball of the ÖVP Horn is certainly 
of great importance to the city of Horn.

256
00:45:07,213 --> 00:45:13,493
This ball is the highlight of the Horner Carnival. 

257
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:23,619
At the ball all classes of population meet, 

258
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:32,407
teachers as well as the medical profession, 

259
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:40,037
civil servants, business, 
and of course dependent workers. 

260
00:45:40,927 --> 00:45:52,368
Moreover, this ball is visited 
by many foreign visitors.
