00:00:49,607 --> 00:00:53,282
FLIES ON THE WALL

2
00:00:53,967 --> 00:00:57,004
TV SURVEILLANCE

3
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:21,682
Come to my office.
- Sure.

4
00:01:21,807 --> 00:01:26,358
The person in custody won't talk
until we've seen this.

5
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:29,445
I've read the autopsy report.

6
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:34,482
Nasty piece of work.
Flemming is on his way.

7
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:38,361
- How did the interrogation go?
- It's postponed. Grab a chair.

8
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:41,763
Let's look at this.

9
00:01:55,887 --> 00:01:58,879
It's October 28th today.

10
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:02,158
It's around 2.30 p.m.

11
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:05,597
This is a very personal film.

12
00:02:09,447 --> 00:02:12,644
It may never
be shown anywhere.

13
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:16,396
I want to clean up ...

14
00:02:16,527 --> 00:02:19,325
... in my personal life.

15
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:24,836
I'm going to
record everything.

16
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:30,846
I will leave it up to
random events -

17
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:34,004
- and let the film
take its own direction.

18
00:02:35,047 --> 00:02:38,357
That's all I know ... so far.

19
00:02:41,247 --> 00:02:44,637
So that's a start anyway.

20
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:50,604
Yeah ... That's it.

21
00:02:57,447 --> 00:03:00,962
SIX WEEKS EARLIER

22
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:13,003
<i>This is the fourth time this award is</i>
<i>given for a critical documentary.</i>

23
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:18,963
<i>It was destined that The Third Eye</i>
<i>one day would go to My Larsen.</i>

24
00:03:19,087 --> 00:03:23,558
<i>My Larsen is 33 years old,</i>
<i>a graduate from the Film School -</i>

25
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:26,804
<i>- she had her debut in 1996</i>
<i>with "The Queen".</i>

26
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:30,840
<i>A film that compromised</i>
<i>My's person -</i>

27
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:36,166
<i>- because the tabloids badgered her</i>
<i>for having dated the Crown Prince.</i>

28
00:03:36,287 --> 00:03:41,407
This paper swallowed the bait
and printed a downright hoax.

29
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:43,677
Hi, My.

30
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,436
Peter?
What are you doing here?

31
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:51,560
I'll call you, alright?
Congratulations.

32
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:55,760
My exposed the sect leader
undercover ...

33
00:03:57,807 --> 00:04:00,879
... that's journalism at its best.

34
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:04,886
My, come
and get the 50.000 -

35
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:08,124
- that you so richly deserve.

36
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:19,283
Thanks for the money
after eight years of hard work.

37
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:25,277
I'll spend them on a boob job
so I can make some new films.

38
00:04:25,407 --> 00:04:27,443
Thank you.

39
00:04:34,847 --> 00:04:38,203
Completely out of sight.
Yes ... Good.

40
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:40,761
I was in love with her -

41
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:45,039
- for as long as she'd let me.

42
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:49,046
That's the annoying
thing about My.

43
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:52,364
You feel you have
to get her permission.

44
00:04:54,647 --> 00:04:59,198
It wasn't until later I discovered
that she'd never loved me.

45
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:04,720
But I don't think she's able to.
Something else happens.

46
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:08,237
She feels flattered.

47
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:13,805
Then she holds on for a while to see
if she can get something out of it.

48
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:18,677
She's afraid of something.

49
00:05:20,007 --> 00:05:24,000
Sometimes I'm afraid
that I'll break.

50
00:05:26,007 --> 00:05:28,840
And go into a thousand pieces.

51
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,680
Snap ...

52
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:39,598
Perhaps because I'm afraid that
there's no one to pick up the pieces.

53
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:50,555
Should I just talk
or do you ask questions?

54
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:55,556
I think I'm a good friend to you.
I'm there if you need me.

55
00:05:55,687 --> 00:06:00,158
But ... I don't really feel ...

56
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:03,916
You're not there
when I need you.

57
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:10,043
You're hard to get hold of
and you're always on the move.

58
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:13,477
That's not very appealing.
- I really like you.

59
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,997
But that's how it feels.
It really does.

60
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:21,086
I'm really hurt by that.
- Your phone's ringing.

61
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:26,406
We talk about lots of things.
- My, your phone's ringing.

62
00:06:28,527 --> 00:06:32,361
Hello?
<i>- Hi. It's Peter Friis.</i>

63
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:36,605
Why did you come to the prize thing
and call me now? You need money?

64
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:41,479
<i>I guess I have to talk to all</i>
<i>my old boyfriends today.</i>

65
00:06:41,607 --> 00:06:43,802
<i>Did you get married?</i>

66
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:46,999
<i>I want to talk to you.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

67
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:54,636
Hi!

68
00:07:00,527 --> 00:07:04,076
This is our floor.

69
00:07:05,327 --> 00:07:08,683
This is Allan who works with us.
- Hi.

70
00:07:08,807 --> 00:07:11,685
I made some coffee for us.
- Good.

71
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:15,595
Are you recording?
- I can't believe you got past security.

72
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:19,561
I record everything.
- I should have washed my hair.

73
00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:22,997
Congratulations.
Your speech was great.

74
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:26,961
Why did you call me?
- Let's cut to the chase.

75
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:29,521
Have a seat.

76
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:35,563
It seems that people around here
are crazy about your films.

77
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:40,761
We want to hear if you're interested
in doing a film project for us.

78
00:07:40,887 --> 00:07:45,403
You're a spin doctor, Peter.
Too much.

79
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:49,486
Is this your office?
- I'm the head of public relations.

80
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:54,727
We want to try to counteract
the contempt for politicians.

81
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:58,237
Which we in part are to blame for.

82
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:01,996
Also the Liberal Party has
given the impression -

83
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:05,961
- that we also control
the media's portrayal of us.

84
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:09,397
Nothing new in modern politics,
but we'd like to turn it around.

85
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:13,486
And we want to do it
openly and honestly.

86
00:08:13,607 --> 00:08:16,917
An important message
to send out -

87
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:21,199
- and something
the voters will understand.

88
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:26,447
Your job would be
to profile the party -

89
00:08:26,567 --> 00:08:31,482
- in a documentary to be shown
on TV prior to the next election.

90
00:08:31,607 --> 00:08:36,397
We want the documentary to
take place in Ravnskov District.

91
00:08:38,087 --> 00:08:41,557
The important thing is,
you can do as you like.

92
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:46,522
You have a free reign.
And you will be well paid.

93
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:49,957
I don't vote for the Liberal Party.
- I know.

94
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:54,797
But see it as an opportunity
to test your own beliefs.

95
00:08:54,927 --> 00:08:58,317
If the Liberal Party has any
double standards you'll find them.

96
00:08:58,447 --> 00:09:02,360
Why not expose the Liberal Party
for it's own money?

97
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:08,119
If you pass on this
you're dumber that I thought.

98
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:28,965
<i>It's political suicide.</i>

99
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:33,080
<i>I'll make a "nice" film</i>
<i>with Peter and his friends.</i>

100
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:36,040
So long to Copenhagen.

101
00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:42,640
My ...

102
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:50,682
Your contact at City Hall
is Helle Tesch.

103
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:54,959
She'll help you with everything
concerning local government.

104
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:02,482
RAVNSKOV DISTRICT

105
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:15,926
Doesn't it smell strange?

106
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:26,159
I had to brief Balder about you. They
have their own agenda. Or he does.

107
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:30,326
How much do you make?
Do spin doctors make the big bucks?

108
00:10:30,447 --> 00:10:35,362
You're here to butcher us. I forgot.
Would you turn that off?

109
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:43,397
I'm not here to butcher any one.
It's purely for therapeutical purposes.

110
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:49,761
So this Balder has his own agenda.
That's a start.

111
00:10:49,887 --> 00:10:54,642
What's he like?
- He's the may or of Ravnskov.

112
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:58,885
A new breed of politician and ...
- And ...?

113
00:10:59,007 --> 00:11:02,522
Ordinary, maybe.
An attribute for a politician.

114
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:06,606
Don't you know him?
- I met him once.

115
00:11:06,727 --> 00:11:11,596
I got the sense he didn't like me.
He's quick to judge people.

116
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:13,285
Me too.

117
00:11:14,727 --> 00:11:19,084
Balder will insist the film is about him,
so he can keep tabs on you.

118
00:11:19,207 --> 00:11:24,042
He has a soft spot for beautiful
women, otherwise he's a wizard.

119
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:28,160
I thought that was the
spin doctor, Harry Potter.

120
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:33,486
How many Harry Potters are there in
your party? All crazy about blondes?

121
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:38,522
Always jabbering away.
- Are you staying over?

122
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:46,681
I'll call you, My.

123
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:51,323
I feel kinda lonely in this suite
you got for me.

124
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:53,961
Talk to you soon.

125
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,999
Drive safely.

126
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:30,282
Hello?
<i>- It's the reception.</i>

127
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:33,558
<i>I wanted to inform you</i>
<i>that City Hall is paying -</i>

128
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:39,239
<i>- for your use of the gym.</i>
<i>It's open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.</i>

129
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:44,441
Thanks. I'd like to inform you
that there's a strange smell.

130
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:46,717
<i>I'll be right up.</i>

131
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:52,000
We thought we were rid of it.

132
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:57,717
When they built the hotel a fox
got caught between the floors.

133
00:12:57,847 --> 00:13:00,520
And we couldn't get to it.

134
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,878
We've had to wait for it to rot.

135
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:07,566
When the weather changes
the smell seeps out.

136
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,326
Can't you give me another room?

137
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:14,679
There's a conference.
Everything's booked.

138
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:18,925
I'll leave these here.
Just spray if you need to.

139
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:22,164
Me?!
This doesn't smell any better.

140
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:24,881
We can just air out.

141
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:30,398
There ...
Good night.

142
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:52,638
I'd like a cab to Copenhagen.
Yes, as soon as possible.

143
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:58,277
I know, I just got here.
Please do as I tell you!

144
00:13:59,607 --> 00:14:02,280
Thanks.

145
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:12,805
<i>I'd like a cab to Copenhagen.</i>

146
00:14:20,287 --> 00:14:22,881
I'll cut here.

147
00:14:25,207 --> 00:14:29,485
My, we almost didn't meet,
but you changed your mind.

148
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:33,043
You wanted to tell the truth
about us on TV.

149
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:38,639
My name is Arne Thorsen. I know the
truth about the events in Ravnskov.

150
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:43,164
I want to tell my version
of what happened -

151
00:14:43,287 --> 00:14:46,882
- when Ravnskov lost its dignity.

152
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:53,479
Who the guilty parties are
that should be held accountable.

153
00:14:53,607 --> 00:14:59,477
The account must be settled.
This is my editing equipment.

154
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:07,639
<i>My, I want you to interview me.</i>
<i>I want you to do it now.</i>

155
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:11,680
<i>I'm not doing it.</i>
<i>You understand?</i>

156
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:28,487
A dead fox ...?

157
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:32,998
Ravnskov District.
I'll do it.

158
00:15:33,127 --> 00:15:38,247
<i>Ravnskov District. Can I help you?</i>
- My Larsen. Svend Balder, please.

159
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:41,359
<i>He's in a meeting.</i>
- When can I reach him?

160
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:44,763
<i>Let me give you his secretary.</i>
- Thanks.

161
00:15:44,887 --> 00:15:50,405
<i>Balder's office. Cecilia speaking.</i>
- My Larsen. Svend Balder, please.

162
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,518
<i>Concerning?</i>

163
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:57,038
I just moved here. I'd like to know
more. Everyone talks about him.

164
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:59,806
<i>Yes, but he's hard to get hold of.</i>

165
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:05,285
<i>Go to our website. The mayor</i>
<i>will answer your questions.</i>

166
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:08,877
Okay, I'll do that.

167
00:16:09,007 --> 00:16:12,158
You must be My.

168
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,962
Helle Tesch.
I was wondering where you were.

169
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:20,444
I just got here.
- Welcome. I hope I can assist you.

170
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:25,163
Let me know if you need anything.
- I'll let you know.

171
00:16:25,287 --> 00:16:28,518
Don't hesitate, My.
Just call me.

172
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:32,560
I'd like to buy you lunch.
I brought some lunch vouchers.

173
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:34,917
This is yours.
- Thanks.

174
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:39,438
He doesn't want to talk to you.
Don't wait around for him.

175
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:45,164
There's a young journalist roaming
around. This is our smoking room.

176
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:49,803
There's no smoking in the rest
of the building. Do you smoke?

177
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,805
No. Do you?
- No.

178
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:55,600
This is my office.

179
00:16:56,767 --> 00:17:00,123
That's the mayor's office.

180
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:06,883
This is your key and your
car is in the parking lot.

181
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:11,239
Would you sign here?
- Yes, of course.

182
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:18,637
There you go.
- Keep it.

183
00:17:26,407 --> 00:17:28,443
Keep it ...

184
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:40,922
I heard that Svend Balder is
in the restaurant.

185
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:47,122
I'm afraid I can't answer that.
Ask about Svend Balder at City Hall.

186
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,677
Svend Balder?
- Yes.

187
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:55,197
My Larsen. I'm making the film
about the Ravnskov District.

188
00:17:55,327 --> 00:17:59,923
Well, then the film's about me.
- Fine with me.

189
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:05,280
They told me it was a man,
but I'm thrilled it's not.

190
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:09,082
Hi. This is our finance director,
Arne Thorsen.

191
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:13,041
Nice camera. Is it a Panasonic?
- Yes.

192
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:17,683
These two fellows are called Anders.
Everyone's called Anders here.

193
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:22,403
Their field is tourism and activities.
The land of milk and honey.

194
00:18:22,527 --> 00:18:27,521
We're heading for the sauna.
Talk to Helle if you need anything.

195
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:30,445
But we had an appointment.
- I don't have time.

196
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:34,526
We're going south for a bit.
See you.

197
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:43,405
Why should I move here? I have
no kids and I retire in 30 years.

198
00:18:43,527 --> 00:18:47,076
Because you're turned on
by naked men.

199
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:50,597
The film is about Svend Balder
and he's going to the sauna.

200
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:53,685
Talk to Helle.
She has a schedule for you.

201
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:57,595
Unless you want to sweat
with us men.

202
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:09,519
I'm going to shower.

203
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:14,004
You said the film should be about you.
- I think I'll ...

204
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:25,085
Don't you find this awkward
in a film my party is producing?

205
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:27,846
Like a scene
from the Christmas party.

206
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:33,087
Should I turn it off?
- Of course. It's too private.

207
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:37,200
Then do I get to make
a film about you and Ravnskov?

208
00:19:37,327 --> 00:19:40,956
If you turn off the camera
until I am dressed.

209
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:53,923
<i>The plan is to follow</i>
<i>Svend Balder around.</i>

210
00:19:54,047 --> 00:19:58,837
<i>Granted, he went along with it</i>
<i>because I showed him my breasts.</i>

211
00:20:06,287 --> 00:20:10,485
He felt bulldozed. He's pissed off.
- Right ...

212
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:14,921
Turn it off.
You can't film in here.

213
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,198
You can't keep me
from filming at City Hall.

214
00:20:18,327 --> 00:20:22,445
I decide who films where.
Turn it off.

215
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:30,437
Wait here.

216
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,081
We've discussed it.
I told you ...

217
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:43,315
There you are.
- Hi, Helle.

218
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:49,758
<i>Hi, Helle.</i>

219
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:53,675
<i>Is it possible for me to ...</i>

220
00:20:53,807 --> 00:20:59,165
<i>The way I see it you're breaking</i>
<i>a verbal agreement.</i>

221
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:03,758
<i>It's called a breech of contract.</i>
<i>- Not in my world.</i>

222
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:08,165
<i>Just because we talk nice to you</i>
<i>doesn 't mean there's a contract.</i>

223
00:21:08,287 --> 00:21:11,165
<i>The syndicate's board</i>
<i>have certain rules.</i>

224
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:15,041
We can't use you.
We're not allowed to.

225
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:20,924
But I can offer you a consultant's fee
of 300.000 for renovating the beach.

226
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,880
You're my friend, Svend.

227
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:26,840
I'm not your consultant.

228
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:33,202
<i>You know what I mean, right?</i>
<i>It's worth at least 100 million.</i>

229
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:40,362
Tell me one thing. Your political
adversaries here in Ravnskov ...

230
00:21:40,487 --> 00:21:44,196
Do they know
what you're up to?

231
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:51,325
Sand and waste
that's never been moved.

232
00:21:51,447 --> 00:21:54,723
All the invoices ...
Do they know about this?

233
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:59,682
<i>You buying a huge boat and</i>
<i>building a pool in your backyard -</i>

234
00:21:59,807 --> 00:22:03,243
<i>- because you think you have</i>
<i>a contract is not my problem.</i>

235
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:07,565
<i>I could get some new friends.</i>
<i>- Are you blackmailing me?</i>

236
00:22:07,687 --> 00:22:11,999
<i>I'm just describing</i>
<i>how you treat people.</i>

237
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,762
Did you film this?

238
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:19,766
Your Liberal buddy
threw me out of City Hall.

239
00:22:19,887 --> 00:22:22,003
Okay ...

240
00:22:22,127 --> 00:22:27,679
Now what do we do?
- Are you asking me?

241
00:22:27,807 --> 00:22:32,005
You're paying me to be here.
Don't you brief each other?

242
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:35,278
I don't exactly feel welcome.

243
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:38,797
I don't like it, I have to admit.

244
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:42,283
And I don't like you
recording me now.

245
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:49,364
I have to look into this, My.

246
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:54,317
We'll call off the film for now.

247
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:57,245
Call it off?
- Yes.

248
00:22:57,367 --> 00:23:01,997
Go back to Copenhagen. I'll call you.
- Are you telling me to stop?

249
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:06,678
I'm telling you I have look into
whether this is what we want.

250
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:10,595
We can make a film
somewhere else.

251
00:23:10,727 --> 00:23:12,877
With who?

252
00:23:13,007 --> 00:23:17,046
I'm so provoked by this.
You gave me a free reign.

253
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:19,806
I'll call you.

254
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,286
I have you on tape, Peter.

255
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:28,847
Jesus Christ ...

256
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:38,845
<i>You've reached Peter Friis.</i>
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

257
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:44,246
Hi, Peter. I just want to
let you know that I'm staying.

258
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:48,121
You ran out on our agreement.
You screwed me.

259
00:23:48,247 --> 00:23:54,004
You're in the film now. It's actually
more interesting because of you.

260
00:23:54,127 --> 00:23:56,118
See you.

261
00:25:25,687 --> 00:25:28,997
I hear you're interested
in building projects.

262
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:33,917
Yes. Is that illegal too?
- No, hardly.

263
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:38,120
Do you know what you're filming?
- No. Tell me.

264
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:42,684
Let me show you something.
Leave the camera. Follow me.

265
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,957
Unless you're blind without it.

266
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:48,045
Mogens, I'll catch a ride
from our director.

267
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:52,046
Pick me up at the hotel tomorrow.
- Okay.

268
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:53,998
Are you staying
at the hotel tonight?

269
00:25:54,127 --> 00:25:59,884
I have a suite there where I work late,
so I don't disturb my family.

270
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:09,077
We bought this site
via the syndicate.

271
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:12,358
It's now called Ravnskov Beach.

272
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:17,003
The elevated railway will bring
the citizens from midtown out here.

273
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:20,437
To the Beach Park,
as the architects say.

274
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:26,039
Like a Mediterranean dream? You're
making a croisette. That sounds great.

275
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:31,439
Yes ...
It is quite great.

276
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:35,755
And over here and along there -

277
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:41,484
- there will be public facilities
with leisure and sports activities.

278
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:45,395
It's all about the quality of life
in Ravnskov.

279
00:26:45,527 --> 00:26:49,486
We might even move
City Hall down here.

280
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:52,883
Are your legs cold?
- A little.

281
00:26:55,087 --> 00:26:59,319
I'm sorry about the other day,
when I snapped at you.

282
00:26:59,447 --> 00:27:02,996
I was a bit annoyed
and stressed out. It happens.

283
00:27:03,127 --> 00:27:06,244
But that's over with.

284
00:27:31,687 --> 00:27:34,599
Do you have to work?
- Yes, unfortunately.

285
00:27:34,727 --> 00:27:37,082
Alright then.

286
00:27:58,287 --> 00:28:02,200
Do you know if
your co-workers fear you?

287
00:28:02,327 --> 00:28:05,444
I think so. I know so.
- Really?

288
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:10,595
But they don't show it.
Fear is a personal matter.

289
00:28:10,727 --> 00:28:15,198
I fear my adversaries too.
- Do you have a lot of those?

290
00:28:17,407 --> 00:28:20,399
Fear keeps you on your toes.

291
00:28:21,407 --> 00:28:25,400
That's how I feel anyway.
Being afraid is fine by me.

292
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:30,965
Do you have any friends?
- Friends? I don't know.

293
00:28:32,407 --> 00:28:36,286
Are you my friend?
- Me?

294
00:28:36,407 --> 00:28:40,719
I don't think so.
- Oh ...

295
00:28:40,847 --> 00:28:45,398
It takes me a while
to get to know a person.

296
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:48,917
I'll take my shoes off
in the meantime.

297
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:53,006
What should we call the film?
- Let me think about it.

298
00:28:53,127 --> 00:28:57,006
We could call it
"The man with the smelly socks".

299
00:28:57,127 --> 00:29:01,086
What? Is it that bad?
- Yes.

300
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:06,327
Sorry to hear that.
We better turn on the vent.

301
00:29:06,447 --> 00:29:10,486
Hi. What kind of food
do you have?

302
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:16,160
Can you make a club sandwich?

303
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,847
I think this is yours.

304
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:28,286
Don't we have other trucks
to pick up waste?

305
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:30,967
It doesn't have to be dump trucks.

306
00:29:33,847 --> 00:29:37,681
If we can keep
the union out of it ...

307
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:41,727
Yeah ...

308
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:45,760
I can't decide on that right now.

309
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:50,677
But someone else must ...
Yes, exactly.

310
00:29:51,927 --> 00:29:54,919
Yes, that's evident.

311
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:59,279
Okay, I can't decide right now.

312
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:02,604
Yes, alright. Bye-bye.

313
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,716
How many kids does he have?

314
00:31:04,847 --> 00:31:09,045
Two, Amanda and Sofie.

315
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:12,204
I make films too.

316
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:15,319
Well, it's amateur movies.

317
00:31:15,447 --> 00:31:20,123
But I have a Sony and
editing equipment. I have it all.

318
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:25,765
Can I show you my short films?
I'd like to get your opinion.

319
00:31:25,887 --> 00:31:30,403
Maybe you can give me some tips.
- Sure.

320
00:31:33,247 --> 00:31:37,399
Are we running late, Mogens?
- We'll survive.

321
00:31:39,327 --> 00:31:43,957
We're getting at bite to eat
with the economic committee.

322
00:31:44,087 --> 00:31:47,966
We like to meet
under casual circumstances.

323
00:31:48,087 --> 00:31:52,797
I know I'm ahead of my time.
I'm not saying it to be cocky.

324
00:31:52,927 --> 00:31:57,762
I sense resistance from people
like you, Siri and Bjorn -

325
00:31:57,887 --> 00:32:00,799
- and pardon me,
but you're lagging behind.

326
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:03,805
You all know
our collaborators are on board.

327
00:32:03,927 --> 00:32:08,045
So your socialistic
rhetoric is useless.

328
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:13,525
A journalist wants me to comment
on the syndicate's beach clearing.

329
00:32:13,647 --> 00:32:18,198
Every time I pass him on to you
or Arne you never comment on it.

330
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:22,366
I said he should wait.
Like the rest of us ...

331
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:27,402
But you're so secretive, Svend.
- That's an old hat, Siri.

332
00:32:27,527 --> 00:32:31,759
And you know it. Every time you
feel pressured, that comes up.

333
00:32:31,887 --> 00:32:36,403
What happens if we oppose
your proposed plan?

334
00:32:36,527 --> 00:32:39,599
Doesn't that worry you?
- Not again.

335
00:32:39,727 --> 00:32:43,037
What have we achieved,
what are our plans -

336
00:32:43,167 --> 00:32:47,126
- and how do we get there
in the best and least costly way?

337
00:32:49,687 --> 00:32:53,157
Mogens, where's My?
- She had to make a call.

338
00:32:53,287 --> 00:32:56,324
But it was ten minutes ago.

339
00:32:58,247 --> 00:33:02,399
How can you let her film us?
Are you involved with her?

340
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:05,644
I'm handling this my way.

341
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:09,965
I'm an open person, you're closed.
We're just different.

342
00:33:10,087 --> 00:33:15,241
That journalist is e-mailing me
about the soil analysis.

343
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:21,602
Did he talk to Zlatan? Maybe we
should have lunch with him again.

344
00:33:21,727 --> 00:33:25,606
Zlatan ... I'm not taking part
in an environmental debate.

345
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:29,276
It's not a good time to have
a journalist in our car.

346
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:32,240
That's what she is,
your film floozy.

347
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:37,282
My film floozy ...
Get a grip, Arne.

348
00:33:37,407 --> 00:33:40,126
I'm sorry.

349
00:33:42,247 --> 00:33:46,718
Can I film now?
- Sure, we're game.

350
00:33:52,127 --> 00:33:56,962
We're exhausted. Right, Arne?
- Yes, but it was a good meeting.

351
00:33:57,087 --> 00:33:59,840
It sure was.

352
00:34:28,647 --> 00:34:31,286
I have to be careful now ...

353
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:36,765
... because I ...

354
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:49,086
... I might feel something here.

355
00:34:55,967 --> 00:34:58,686
Come in.
- Can I film in here?

356
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:01,526
Go ahead,
I don't mind a bit.

357
00:35:01,647 --> 00:35:04,719
This is where I live.

358
00:35:04,847 --> 00:35:08,078
My wife lives in our summer house.

359
00:35:09,447 --> 00:35:13,076
Or rather ...
Well, it's hers now.

360
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:16,882
In the past I did
a lot of angling ...

361
00:35:17,007 --> 00:35:23,162
And hunting with a bow and arrow.
That has always fascinated me.

362
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:29,317
That's a compound bow, but now I
spend my time making short films.

363
00:35:29,447 --> 00:35:34,601
My goal is to
make a real movie.

364
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:38,561
I really wanted
to be a film director.

365
00:35:38,687 --> 00:35:42,123
That was my big dream,
but it didn't turn out that way.

366
00:35:42,247 --> 00:35:45,159
Let me show you something.

367
00:35:47,287 --> 00:35:50,518
I've attached a camera here.

368
00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:54,117
That way my hands are free to fish.

369
00:35:54,247 --> 00:35:56,283
Cool.

370
00:35:56,407 --> 00:35:59,479
I make the music myself.

371
00:36:09,487 --> 00:36:12,684
There's a lot of waiting -

372
00:36:12,807 --> 00:36:18,916
- but video tape is cheap these days,
so I just wait to hit the jackpot.

373
00:36:19,047 --> 00:36:22,881
But you know all about that.
- What do you mean?

374
00:36:23,007 --> 00:36:27,205
You use a hidden camera, don't you?
- Oh, like that.

375
00:36:27,327 --> 00:36:31,559
You don't hit the jackpot every time.
- No, I guess not.

376
00:36:38,647 --> 00:36:41,764
I'm impressed, Arne.

377
00:36:45,127 --> 00:36:49,166
I was wondering if you
wanted to interview me.

378
00:36:49,287 --> 00:36:54,122
I can tell you about the district.
- The film is mainly about Svend.

379
00:36:55,647 --> 00:37:00,482
He has given up his family,
and they have given up on him.

380
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:05,123
He's paying the price.

381
00:37:05,247 --> 00:37:09,718
He's lucky to have you.
- I had to pay the price too.

382
00:37:09,847 --> 00:37:13,396
I had to sacrifice my wife,
my home, my family and friends.

383
00:37:13,527 --> 00:37:17,281
I've been married
to him for 15 years.

384
00:37:17,407 --> 00:37:23,004
Some people can't say 'thank you'.
Unfortunately, Svend uses people.

385
00:37:23,127 --> 00:37:25,925
It's horrible to feel used.

386
00:37:26,047 --> 00:37:30,484
'Cause one day you're all used up,
and then you're just ...

387
00:37:31,887 --> 00:37:34,401
Then you're nothing.

388
00:37:37,527 --> 00:37:41,236
I'm sorry. Forget it.
Eat.

389
00:37:45,527 --> 00:37:49,725
Well, you can just interview yourself.
- You're right.

390
00:37:49,847 --> 00:37:54,477
My, I was thinking I could help you.
- What do you mean?

391
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:57,599
We should collaborate on this.

392
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:03,045
That's sweet, but I don't think so.
- Think about it.

393
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:07,285
Let's keep in touch.
Think about it.

394
00:38:18,847 --> 00:38:24,524
Arne, you know what I did to my kids
when they didn't wipe up after a spill?

395
00:38:24,647 --> 00:38:28,560
I took them by the hand,
stuck a towel in their hands -

396
00:38:28,687 --> 00:38:33,044
- bent them down
and made wiping movements.

397
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:37,843
That's your job. I can't sign it.
You have to do it.

398
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:43,646
I don't like it, Svend.
- No.

399
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:48,602
Get over it, because you're the CEO.
Go ahead.

400
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:54,283
It's a great deal of money.
- Yes.

401
00:38:54,407 --> 00:38:57,558
That's why I need your signature.

402
00:39:00,447 --> 00:39:04,486
Why do you allow me to make a film
about you? There must be a reason.

403
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:08,043
Do you always obey your party?

404
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:13,116
No, I think they see me as
a competitor. Somehow.

405
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:18,077
Why allow you to make
a film about me?

406
00:39:18,207 --> 00:39:22,325
It frightens me a bit and I like that.
I already told you.

407
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:27,680
Since you're filming our district
I'd like to know more about you.

408
00:39:27,807 --> 00:39:33,120
Yeah. What do you want to know?
- Your height, weight and shoe size.

409
00:39:35,887 --> 00:39:39,846
That's easy,
because I don't know.

410
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:42,765
Oh ... How do you buy shoes?

411
00:39:44,127 --> 00:39:48,757
My friends say
I'm unappealing.

412
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:54,359
And my ex-boyfriends say
I wasn't able to love them.

413
00:39:54,487 --> 00:39:57,718
I seem to take advantage
of my friends.

414
00:39:57,847 --> 00:40:02,762
If I talk about myself, I'll probably lie.
- Lie all you want. That's just dandy.

415
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:10,078
I promised myself I'd find
one little truth about myself.

416
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:13,483
That's a promise I made.

417
00:40:14,487 --> 00:40:19,607
Then I can call my girlfriends again.
- The perfect self-deception.

418
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:25,518
How will you honor your promise?
- By being honest and sincere.

419
00:40:25,647 --> 00:40:28,480
Is honesty the truth?

420
00:40:28,607 --> 00:40:32,725
If I'm not honest
then I'm not telling the truth.

421
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:36,806
I don't buy that.
- Well, I do.

422
00:40:52,727 --> 00:40:57,403
Hi, honey.
How is it going?

423
00:40:57,527 --> 00:41:02,965
No, I'm just sitting here
thinking about you naked.

424
00:41:04,927 --> 00:41:08,078
I don't feel like going to work.

425
00:41:08,207 --> 00:41:11,324
Yes, I will. Bye-bye.

426
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:20,245
You're strange.
- Yes.

427
00:41:22,127 --> 00:41:26,484
No, you're just stupid.
- Does that make me less truthful?

428
00:41:27,887 --> 00:41:31,675
No, you're just stupid.
- Honesty and truth don't go together.

429
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:37,677
The world is full of contradictions
and I've accepted that.

430
00:41:37,807 --> 00:41:41,766
Although it's painful at times.

431
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:57,639
I think I've fallen for a man
I shouldn't fall for.

432
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,844
He is ...

433
00:42:05,127 --> 00:42:07,846
I don't know.

434
00:42:11,687 --> 00:42:15,077
He gives me a sense of security.

435
00:42:20,887 --> 00:42:23,924
That's a new one for me.

436
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:40,240
Smile, Arne.
You're on camera!

437
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:46,443
Let's dance. Get rid of that.
- Would you hold it, Arne?

438
00:43:16,287 --> 00:43:21,156
He sacrificed his best friend and took
a lover who meddled in our affairs.

439
00:43:21,287 --> 00:43:24,757
<i>I have to follow</i>
<i>Svend Balder around.</i>

440
00:43:24,887 --> 00:43:29,358
He had lost control. He didn't get
that it would all be over soon.

441
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:39,481
If I had to give career advice
after 35 years experience -

442
00:43:39,607 --> 00:43:45,239
- is would be to forget
one's fear of authority figures -

443
00:43:45,367 --> 00:43:49,679
- and trust your expertise.
That has to be in order.

444
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:54,562
Numbers can become
the little friends -

445
00:43:54,687 --> 00:43:59,283
- you can go to bed with at night
and wake up with in the morning.

446
00:43:59,407 --> 00:44:04,401
A budget has its own life.
You must learn to befriend it.

447
00:44:04,527 --> 00:44:08,725
The worse part is
when it overpowers you.

448
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:14,001
You become the boy in the fairytale
with the sword facing the dragon -

449
00:44:14,127 --> 00:44:20,475
- and you have to defend the town
against a fire-breathing dragon.

450
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:25,397
You're all alone.
You have created it.

451
00:44:25,527 --> 00:44:29,122
You are responsible for your creation.
What do you do?

452
00:44:39,487 --> 00:44:44,402
Good lord.
- Tell me about it.

453
00:44:44,527 --> 00:44:49,157
His books are probably cooked too.
He won't do it.

454
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:53,280
He thinks we're the bad guys.

455
00:44:53,407 --> 00:44:58,197
But a miracle might save us.
He could sink with his big boat.

456
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:05,763
He could sink with his big boat.
- He could commit suicide.

457
00:45:05,887 --> 00:45:08,481
He's been kind of depressed.

458
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:16,195
He could commit suicide.
He's been kind of depressed.

459
00:45:32,407 --> 00:45:37,037
Is Svend ready?
- He's in a meeting. It'll take a while.

460
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:40,239
Then I'll just wait here.

461
00:45:58,687 --> 00:46:02,202
Hi. Who are you looking for?
- Are you Zlatan?

462
00:46:02,327 --> 00:46:05,399
Yes ... Thanks for coming.

463
00:46:05,527 --> 00:46:07,438
Do you have time to talk?
- Of course.

464
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:12,402
Come on in.
- Thanks. Wow, nice boat.

465
00:46:16,127 --> 00:46:19,164
Are you recording me?
- Are you shy?

466
00:46:19,287 --> 00:46:22,359
A little bit.
I'm not used to being on TV.

467
00:46:22,487 --> 00:46:27,242
I don't know where to look ...
at you or ... Can you turn it off?

468
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:33,283
Yes, it's done. What do you want?
Why did you call me?

469
00:46:35,647 --> 00:46:40,243
I've spent 15 years of my life
making my business grow.

470
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:45,805
A business that has supported
my family and many others.

471
00:46:47,287 --> 00:46:51,644
Svend is used to paying off those
who are on his side.

472
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:55,965
First he buys you,
then he sells you.

473
00:46:57,607 --> 00:47:01,486
Now I'm on
the verge of bankruptcy.

474
00:47:01,607 --> 00:47:05,759
He has fired me
and my employees.

475
00:47:10,807 --> 00:47:15,085
I have a little present for him,
as pay back.

476
00:47:16,527 --> 00:47:19,758
I thought I'd give it to you.

477
00:47:20,767 --> 00:47:24,919
You don't get it.
- No, I don't.

478
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:33,878
There you go.

479
00:47:35,527 --> 00:47:39,076
Where are all
the forks and spoons?

480
00:47:39,207 --> 00:47:42,279
I forgot everything.
I have cake.

481
00:47:53,607 --> 00:47:55,677
<i>Hauling of waste</i>

482
00:48:20,447 --> 00:48:23,166
Where are we going?

483
00:48:25,647 --> 00:48:29,640
Good question.
I don't really know.

484
00:48:29,767 --> 00:48:33,521
I just thought
we needed to get away.

485
00:48:46,407 --> 00:48:48,682
I have something for you.

486
00:48:48,807 --> 00:48:51,879
I have something for you too.
- For me?

487
00:48:52,887 --> 00:48:56,118
Who should get something first?

488
00:48:57,327 --> 00:48:59,761
Maybe me.

489
00:49:03,687 --> 00:49:06,281
Here.

490
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:22,884
Did you buy that for me?
- Yes, I did.

491
00:49:23,007 --> 00:49:27,842
I usually send Mogens out for things,
but I had some time during lunch.

492
00:49:29,327 --> 00:49:32,205
It's from a second hand-dealer
behind the mall.

493
00:49:32,327 --> 00:49:34,443
It's really sweet.

494
00:49:34,567 --> 00:49:39,243
When I saw it
I knew it was perfect for you.

495
00:49:46,487 --> 00:49:49,763
It looks really good on you.

496
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:55,998
So far you've been
a fly on the wall.

497
00:49:56,127 --> 00:50:00,279
Maybe a bit annoying,
but I think ...

498
00:50:00,407 --> 00:50:03,558
It's as if
you've turned into ...

499
00:50:03,687 --> 00:50:06,406
A butterfly.

500
00:50:06,527 --> 00:50:10,440
But what did you have for me?

501
00:50:44,487 --> 00:50:49,561
I saw Sofie, my oldest,
in front of the mirror.

502
00:50:49,687 --> 00:50:53,760
She looked at herself
because she got her ears pierced.

503
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:59,166
She was very proud.
And I suddenly saw her.

504
00:51:00,607 --> 00:51:06,557
It was shocking, because I realized
I hadn't seen her at all.

505
00:51:06,687 --> 00:51:10,646
I don't know what she's thinking.
I don't see my children.

506
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:15,795
I know nothing about their homework
or what page they're on in math.

507
00:51:15,927 --> 00:51:19,044
I never help them
with their homework.

508
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:22,477
I'm grateful my wife
takes care of them -

509
00:51:22,607 --> 00:51:25,360
- because then
I can be a politician.

510
00:51:25,487 --> 00:51:28,843
But if I had to choose ...

511
00:51:28,967 --> 00:51:31,800
The truth is what
everything appears to be.

512
00:51:31,927 --> 00:51:37,240
I've dealt with the truth
and refined it damned well.

513
00:51:37,367 --> 00:51:40,996
Yeah ... I know.

514
00:51:41,127 --> 00:51:45,086
You lie,
you control and rule.

515
00:51:45,207 --> 00:51:50,520
I ought to grill you with
a lot of tedious questions ...

516
00:51:55,287 --> 00:51:59,075
A sugar beet factory is shut down.
I propose we buy it.

517
00:51:59,207 --> 00:52:02,722
My idea is to renovate it
and create new jobs.

518
00:52:02,847 --> 00:52:05,839
All for a good cause.

519
00:52:10,487 --> 00:52:16,039
But the factory was antiquated
and never got underway.

520
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:19,762
We were stuck with
the beach property -

521
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:23,675
- and empty buildings
that were run-down.

522
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,277
Svend comes up with an idea.

523
00:52:27,407 --> 00:52:32,197
We form a syndicate
with me as the CEO.

524
00:52:32,327 --> 00:52:38,516
We wanted to build a beach park with
a gym, sailing club and apartments.

525
00:52:38,647 --> 00:52:42,356
We got two European banks,
Konstro in Finland -

526
00:52:42,487 --> 00:52:45,479
- and several contractors
to buy into it.

527
00:52:45,607 --> 00:52:48,963
Our initial capital
was 150 million Euros.

528
00:52:49,087 --> 00:52:53,603
50 million were paid
for site development.

529
00:52:53,727 --> 00:52:56,525
To check the soil for pollution.

530
00:52:56,647 --> 00:53:00,276
The only problem was
we did nothing.

531
00:53:00,407 --> 00:53:03,922
Instead the money
was invested -

532
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:07,960
- in high profile projects
in China and India -

533
00:53:08,087 --> 00:53:12,524
- and as the years went on
more money came in.

534
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:15,923
But nothing happened on the beach.

535
00:53:16,047 --> 00:53:17,844
Nothing.

536
00:53:17,967 --> 00:53:21,039
But ...

537
00:53:22,167 --> 00:53:27,082
Svend got the capital
to renovate the schools in the district.

538
00:53:32,087 --> 00:53:35,523
He was a success.

539
00:53:35,647 --> 00:53:39,560
And I ... gave up.

540
00:54:06,127 --> 00:54:09,756
Alright ... Let's sit down.

541
00:54:09,887 --> 00:54:15,325
Sooner or later we'll have to
come clean. We'll do as follows.

542
00:54:15,447 --> 00:54:20,123
As the syndicate's CEO
you'll say you've lost control.

543
00:54:21,567 --> 00:54:25,685
You acted without the board's
consent and you're resigning.

544
00:54:25,807 --> 00:54:29,083
So you take the blame
for bad management.

545
00:54:29,207 --> 00:54:36,636
To cover all our tracks I have to fire
you as the district's finance director.

546
00:54:36,767 --> 00:54:40,885
What are you saying?
- I have no choice.

547
00:54:41,007 --> 00:54:47,037
<i>Listen, Arne. We got a lot further</i>
<i>than we ever dreamed possible.</i>

548
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:49,237
<i>When things have calmed down -</i>

549
00:54:49,367 --> 00:54:53,440
<i>- you come back and act</i>
<i>as director of tourism.</i>

550
00:54:53,567 --> 00:54:57,924
That's perfect.
Then you can fish all you like.

551
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:02,359
You can't mean it, Svend.
- We have a huge profit right now.

552
00:55:02,487 --> 00:55:06,605
We can start the clean-up
of the Beach Park anytime.

553
00:55:06,727 --> 00:55:11,403
According to what's dictated.
You come back and get a new job.

554
00:55:11,527 --> 00:55:15,566
People will forget about it.
Arne, don't walk out now.

555
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:20,442
<i>Stay and listen. Don 't, Arne!</i>
<i>Don't be stupid.</i>

556
00:55:26,567 --> 00:55:28,683
There you go.

557
00:55:29,807 --> 00:55:32,401
Hi.
- Hi.

558
00:55:32,527 --> 00:55:37,203
Why did you fire Arne?
- Who told you that?

559
00:55:37,327 --> 00:55:41,639
Can't you accept the responsibility?
Are you such a coward?

560
00:55:41,767 --> 00:55:45,316
No, but I did fire Arne.
I have my reasons.

561
00:55:45,447 --> 00:55:47,915
Yeah, just blame it on Arne -

562
00:55:48,047 --> 00:55:52,006
- so you can play the grand mayor
who did nothing wrong.

563
00:55:52,127 --> 00:55:55,642
Listen, I did accept
the responsibility.

564
00:55:55,767 --> 00:56:00,204
My responsibility was to fire Arne.
And I did.

565
00:56:00,327 --> 00:56:04,400
Let me make one thing clear.
Don't come running up to my office -

566
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:08,884
- and lecture me about
what I should and shouldn't do.

567
00:56:09,007 --> 00:56:11,567
I don't interfere
with your little film -

568
00:56:11,687 --> 00:56:15,805
- so don't <i>ever</i> come to my office
and tell me my business!

569
00:56:27,407 --> 00:56:30,604
I have to get that expression
for my film.

570
00:56:41,167 --> 00:56:44,716
Just walk in,
he's at the top of his game.

571
00:56:44,847 --> 00:56:49,841
Can I have a word with you?

572
00:56:51,167 --> 00:56:52,964
About what?

573
00:56:53,127 --> 00:56:56,164
Can we go somewhere?

574
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:59,677
Bruun at the paper said
I could trust you.

575
00:56:59,807 --> 00:57:04,722
You seem to have better access
to City Hall. You want anything?

576
00:57:04,847 --> 00:57:07,645
Thanks.
Balder ignores me.

577
00:57:11,927 --> 00:57:16,762
The question is whether we are on to
the same story from different angles.

578
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:26,038
My editor will kill me
if other papers get this story.

579
00:57:26,167 --> 00:57:30,365
So I have to keep a low profile.
But I thought ...

580
00:57:30,487 --> 00:57:34,844
Since you're a film director
we're not really competitors.

581
00:57:34,967 --> 00:57:38,721
No, we're not.
What do you know, that I don't?

582
00:57:38,847 --> 00:57:43,159
See, that's the question ...

583
00:57:43,287 --> 00:57:48,441
Who will spill the beans first?
- You. After all you contacted me.

584
00:57:52,247 --> 00:57:56,923
I'll say environmental clean-up.
What do you say?

585
00:57:58,487 --> 00:58:00,955
Sand and beach.

586
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:04,238
Then I'll say site development.
- Croisette.

587
00:58:06,607 --> 00:58:10,646
What?
- A new City Hall by the sea.

588
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:14,442
Is he building City Hall by the sea?
- Yes.

589
00:58:14,567 --> 00:58:18,401
But then he'll mix the syndicate's
and district's economy.

590
00:58:18,527 --> 00:58:22,076
Are you sure?
- Yes.

591
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,562
I'm sure were talking
about the same thing.

592
00:58:24,687 --> 00:58:29,078
As soon as Balder discovers
we're building a case against him -

593
00:58:29,207 --> 00:58:31,767
- he'll make up a cover story.

594
00:58:31,887 --> 00:58:36,324
Who did you interview?
Did you talk to Zlatan Selic?

595
00:58:36,447 --> 00:58:41,475
He's Balder's contractor. He's ...
- I know who he is.

596
00:58:41,607 --> 00:58:44,917
I can't get in touch with him.

597
00:58:45,047 --> 00:58:48,926
Ask him why there aren't
any tracks on the beach -

598
00:58:49,047 --> 00:58:53,962
- after they've transported truck
loads of sand. Ask him about that.

599
00:58:54,087 --> 00:58:56,760
I will.

600
00:59:16,007 --> 00:59:18,396
Here you go.

601
00:59:37,487 --> 00:59:41,878
You look mad.
You want to be dropped off?

602
00:59:42,007 --> 00:59:45,443
Every day is not a party.
- Nope.

603
00:59:45,567 --> 00:59:49,003
You can let me in on your schedule.

604
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:53,518
We're going to an anniversary.
We have to present a gift -

605
00:59:53,647 --> 00:59:57,925
- to a teacher who has taught
at one of our schools for 40 years.

606
00:59:58,047 --> 01:00:02,279
Then there's lunch at City Hall
with a renovation company.

607
01:00:02,407 --> 01:00:06,400
After that we go to
Vestre Cemetary at 3 o'clock -

608
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:09,041
- to bury a close colleague.

609
01:00:11,687 --> 01:00:17,876
My primary job is to wait.
Being a driver is just part time.

610
01:00:18,007 --> 01:00:21,682
Then I'll wait with you, Mogens.

611
01:00:24,727 --> 01:00:27,719
The guy in the coffin there ...

612
01:00:27,847 --> 01:00:30,998
I have driven him many times.

613
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:36,645
He was a good guy. A great
poster boy for the immigrants.

614
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:40,965
Who was he?
- Zlatan Selic.

615
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:44,875
I think he had five kids.
What a shame.

616
01:00:45,007 --> 01:00:47,237
Zlatan Selic?!

617
01:00:54,287 --> 01:00:56,437
Hi, My.

618
01:00:56,567 --> 01:01:00,765
Good to see you.
He'll be difficult to interview now.

619
01:01:00,887 --> 01:01:05,483
Can I talk to you? I have ...
- Leave me alone.

620
01:01:05,607 --> 01:01:07,837
I'll call you, okay?

621
01:01:33,407 --> 01:01:36,922
He ...

622
01:01:37,047 --> 01:01:41,359
He went sailing.
He had just bought a big boat.

623
01:01:41,487 --> 01:01:46,277
He was alone and hit a buoy
at full throttle.

624
01:01:46,407 --> 01:01:51,356
My heart goes out to his children.
He should have worn a life jacket.

625
01:01:52,527 --> 01:01:56,600
That's right, Mogens.
He should have.

626
01:02:22,887 --> 01:02:24,843
Who is it?

627
01:02:24,967 --> 01:02:29,006
<i>It's Peter.</i>
<i>Can I come in?</i>

628
01:02:34,607 --> 01:02:38,122
Hi, Peter.
- Hi.

629
01:02:38,247 --> 01:02:40,966
Good to see you.

630
01:02:41,087 --> 01:02:44,238
How's it going?
- Fine.

631
01:02:45,567 --> 01:02:49,446
I just felt cooped up in here.
- Are you recording? Please don't.

632
01:02:49,567 --> 01:02:53,242
I'm not.
I'm glad you came.

633
01:02:53,367 --> 01:02:57,042
My, sit down a minute.

634
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:03,396
I need to talk to you.
- The film is off, My.

635
01:03:03,527 --> 01:03:06,758
We can't burden the government.

636
01:03:06,887 --> 01:03:13,725
Sorry, but we have to call it off.
- But you already did.

637
01:03:13,847 --> 01:03:17,681
I'm not making it for you.
- No, but ...

638
01:03:17,807 --> 01:03:22,676
We don't want to deal with Balder.
Everything is blowing up soon.

639
01:03:22,807 --> 01:03:28,564
I get it. Ravnskov is not
a model district so the film is off.

640
01:03:28,687 --> 01:03:31,565
Give me your tapes.
- No.

641
01:03:31,687 --> 01:03:35,839
Just in case.
- Why?

642
01:03:35,967 --> 01:03:41,121
Balder is done for. That's how it is.
- And that pleases us.

643
01:03:43,727 --> 01:03:48,801
Does it please you?!
What are you talking about?

644
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:53,637
I have a check for the amount
we owe you.

645
01:04:05,647 --> 01:04:08,844
Is that why you sent me here?

646
01:04:08,967 --> 01:04:13,757
Am I part of a plan
to rid you of Balder?

647
01:04:19,047 --> 01:04:22,676
I don't owe you anything, Peter.
- No, you don't.

648
01:04:22,807 --> 01:04:26,595
You did yours and we're pleased.

649
01:04:28,127 --> 01:04:32,006
Please go.
Get out.

650
01:04:34,527 --> 01:04:37,087
It'll work itself out.

651
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:42,201
In a year Ravnskov will have a new
may or. People forget. Life goes on.

652
01:04:42,327 --> 01:04:49,642
Exactly! Then you get a new may or
you can manipulate.

653
01:04:49,767 --> 01:04:53,999
Most politicians are corrupt.
They have fake invoices everywhere.

654
01:04:54,127 --> 01:04:58,359
Balder has made his
own version of our politics.

655
01:04:58,487 --> 01:05:03,356
City Hall is filled with his slogans.
- I want you to leave. Get out.

<i>This is Svend Balder. Please leave</i>
<i>a message and I'll get back to you.</i>

657
01:05:15,887 --> 01:05:18,640
<i>This is Marianne.</i>

658
01:05:18,767 --> 01:05:22,726
<i>Who is it? Hello?</i>

659
01:05:29,487 --> 01:05:33,446
My! Are you still here?
- I'm on my way out.

660
01:05:33,567 --> 01:05:37,355
Did you know Zlatan? Tragic death.
- Yes.

661
01:05:37,487 --> 01:05:41,366
I want you to interview me now.
You promised me.

662
01:05:41,487 --> 01:05:44,684
Another day, Arne.
- You'll forget.

663
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:47,367
I won't.

664
01:05:48,647 --> 01:05:52,560
I want you to do it now!

665
01:05:52,687 --> 01:05:57,158
I'm not interviewing you, Arne.
You understand?!

666
01:06:30,327 --> 01:06:31,965
Sorry, I ...

667
01:06:58,847 --> 01:07:02,999
<i>This is Svend.</i>
- I'm waiting outside in the car.

668
01:07:08,407 --> 01:07:12,400
I have to talk to you.
- <i>Okay.</i>

669
01:07:28,807 --> 01:07:32,561
What?
You have to do it quick.

670
01:07:32,687 --> 01:07:36,885
You shouldn't come here.
What's up?

671
01:07:38,767 --> 01:07:43,079
You look tired.
- I am. It was a rough day.

672
01:07:46,167 --> 01:07:49,398
Are you involved in Zlatan's death?

673
01:07:51,407 --> 01:07:55,082
Zlatan's death?
No, of course not.

674
01:07:55,207 --> 01:08:00,520
Zlatan was a friend of mine.
I've known him for ten years.

675
01:08:03,167 --> 01:08:07,160
Is that why you're here?
- No.

676
01:08:07,287 --> 01:08:12,520
I don't know what you're
worried about. I'm on top of this.

677
01:08:12,647 --> 01:08:16,162
You're not on top of shit, Svend.

678
01:08:17,807 --> 01:08:21,959
Everyone knows what's going on.
Your party, Peter Friis and the press.

679
01:08:22,087 --> 01:08:25,284
What do they know?

680
01:08:25,407 --> 01:08:28,160
Zlatan called me.

681
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:32,758
He gave me an envelope
with the fake invoices you used.

682
01:08:37,567 --> 01:08:41,480
I gave them to a journalist.

683
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:48,078
Why did you do that?

684
01:08:52,847 --> 01:08:56,078
It's got to stop now, Svend.

685
01:08:57,927 --> 01:09:00,043
Hell no.

686
01:11:32,967 --> 01:11:36,676
Your room has been cancelled.
They are not paying anymore.

687
01:11:36,807 --> 01:11:38,923
That's alright. I'm packing.

688
01:11:39,047 --> 01:11:43,962
Should I check you out?
- Go ahead.

689
01:11:44,087 --> 01:11:47,716
I was afraid you had left.
Come with me.

690
01:11:56,487 --> 01:11:58,603
I have to tell you something.

691
01:11:59,767 --> 01:12:02,918
And that is ...

692
01:12:03,047 --> 01:12:06,596
I'm in love with you.

693
01:12:06,727 --> 01:12:09,525
I really am.

694
01:12:11,167 --> 01:12:14,682
That's what I am.
That's how it is.

695
01:12:19,767 --> 01:12:23,965
You heard me, right?
- Yes.

696
01:12:24,087 --> 01:12:26,442
Good.

697
01:12:26,567 --> 01:12:29,365
I don't want you to leave.

698
01:12:29,487 --> 01:12:32,604
I'm stopping.
This is where it ends.

699
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:38,207
Svend Balder,
I wanted to let you comment -

700
01:12:38,327 --> 01:12:42,286
- on the article we're running
tomorrow. Would you do that?

701
01:12:44,847 --> 01:12:47,236
Yes, I would.

702
01:12:47,367 --> 01:12:50,325
You would?
- Yes.

703
01:12:50,447 --> 01:12:53,962
Alright then ...

704
01:12:54,087 --> 01:12:59,559
How do you explain that the clean-up
of the Beach Park never took place?

705
01:12:59,687 --> 01:13:02,724
And what happened to the money?

706
01:13:02,847 --> 01:13:06,601
I'm not going to defend myself.

707
01:13:06,727 --> 01:13:09,958
I admit that I ...

708
01:13:10,087 --> 01:13:13,079
... have oppressed the truth.

709
01:13:13,207 --> 01:13:17,917
I have mislead the City Council,
the syndicate's CEO and board -

710
01:13:18,047 --> 01:13:20,641
- and I speculated with the money -

711
01:13:20,767 --> 01:13:24,316
- intended for the clean-up
of the Beach Park.

712
01:13:24,447 --> 01:13:27,917
I admit to everything
and I'm resigning.

713
01:13:29,807 --> 01:13:32,241
You're resigning ...?
- Yes.

714
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:35,677
Make sure you got in on tape.

715
01:13:37,247 --> 01:13:41,240
So you admit to it?
- Yes. You want me to repeat it?

716
01:13:41,367 --> 01:13:45,997
No need. Can I take your picture?
- Of course.

717
01:13:49,727 --> 01:13:51,285
Thanks.

718
01:13:52,967 --> 01:13:58,724
One last question. What happened
to the money for the Beach Park?

719
01:13:58,847 --> 01:14:04,240
All the funds from this speculation
was invested in Ravnskov District.

720
01:14:04,367 --> 01:14:08,645
They were used for renovating
day-care centers, like I promised.

721
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,917
The money stayed with its citizens.

722
01:14:19,487 --> 01:14:23,241
I promise to stay.

723
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:52,195
When will you get here?
<i>- I'm still at City Hall. I'll hurry.</i>

724
01:14:52,327 --> 01:14:56,161
<i>I'm writing all my co-workers</i>
<i>before it hits the papers.</i>

725
01:14:56,287 --> 01:14:59,324
I don't like it here. If you're not
here soon I'm driving home.

726
01:14:59,447 --> 01:15:04,202
<i>Don't do that. I'll be there in a</i>
<i>couple of hours. Take a nap.</i>

727
01:15:05,887 --> 01:15:11,041
I didn't tell you that Arne was in my
room and made a copy of my film.

728
01:15:11,167 --> 01:15:16,685
<i>Arne? Why would he do that?</i>
- Does Arne know you're resigning?

729
01:15:16,807 --> 01:15:21,835
Maybe you should tell him.
<i>- Arne is no threat. I'll talk to him.</i>

730
01:15:21,967 --> 01:15:27,360
<i>Go to sleep. I'll be at the hotel</i>
<i>in a couple of hours.</i>

731
01:15:27,487 --> 01:15:30,365
<i>Please don't leave, My.</i>

732
01:15:30,487 --> 01:15:34,162
I won't.
I'll wait for you.

733
01:16:27,527 --> 01:16:32,123
Sorry, the door was open.
I just wanted to check.

734
01:16:32,247 --> 01:16:35,762
It's 1.30 in the morning.

735
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:40,596
If everything's alright
I'll be on my way.

736
01:18:08,407 --> 01:18:11,763
<i>Arne?</i>
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

737
01:18:13,127 --> 01:18:16,005
<i>Are you going hunting?</i>

738
01:18:26,207 --> 01:18:28,357
<i>What is it?</i>

739
01:18:28,487 --> 01:18:30,762
<i>What's going on?</i>

740
01:18:30,887 --> 01:18:34,084
<i>What are you doing, Arne?</i>

741
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:47,321
Hello!

742
01:19:48,767 --> 01:19:50,803
Hello!

743
01:19:50,927 --> 01:19:53,521
Is anyone there?

744
01:21:04,327 --> 01:21:06,795
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

745
01:21:06,927 --> 01:21:09,999
<i>Hello!</i>
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

746
01:21:13,607 --> 01:21:17,566
<i>If anyone sees this</i>
<i>they should know -</i>

747
01:21:17,687 --> 01:21:22,317
<i>- that Arne Thorsen</i>
<i>killed Svend Balder.</i>

748
01:21:22,447 --> 01:21:25,041
<i>And he's coming to get me.</i>

749
01:22:01,527 --> 01:22:04,963
This is the end of the film.

750
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:07,920
I'm doing what has to be done.

751
01:22:08,047 --> 01:22:13,405
The police, the judges,
the syndicate attorneys -

752
01:22:13,527 --> 01:22:18,920
- members of the City Council
and every one who sees this -

753
01:22:19,047 --> 01:22:23,996
- must know what I have done.
I take full blame for it.

754
01:22:25,927 --> 01:22:28,964
When I'm no longer here ...

755
01:22:43,847 --> 01:22:48,557
I want you all to know that if
this young lady had stopped me -

756
01:22:48,687 --> 01:22:53,681
- then you had only gotten
her side of the story.

757
01:22:58,607 --> 01:23:02,725
I want to leave behind
a decent balance sheet.

758
01:23:02,847 --> 01:23:08,046
When you find me
you can see my film.

759
01:23:37,447 --> 01:23:40,519
Arne, you can't change things.
Don't you get it?

760
01:23:46,327 --> 01:23:50,479
You're an ordinary man
who doesn't know what he's doing.

761
01:24:52,407 --> 01:24:54,875
My, is it over?

762
01:24:57,087 --> 01:24:59,965
No, not quite.

763
01:25:44,487 --> 01:25:46,921
<i>This is the end of the film.</i>

764
01:25:47,047 --> 01:25:50,119
<i>I take full blame for it.</i>

765
01:25:50,247 --> 01:25:52,920
<i>You're an ordinary man ...</i>

766
01:25:54,287 --> 01:25:58,041
<i>My, is it over?</i>
<i>No, not quite.</i>

<i>may I help you?</i>

769
01:26:44,687 --> 01:26:49,317
I want to turn myself in.
I've killed a man.

770
01:26:52,687 --> 01:26:56,566
<i>State your name, please?</i>
- My Larsen.

771
01:26:58,007 --> 01:27:00,362
What should I do?

772
01:27:00,487 --> 01:27:02,921
<i>Tell us where you are.</i>

773
01:27:27,967 --> 01:27:31,801
I better get back to her.
- Yeah, you better.

774
01:27:34,607 --> 01:27:39,044
Berggreen, this is for you.
- Thanks.
