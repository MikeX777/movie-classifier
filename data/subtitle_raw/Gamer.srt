{Y:i}Some of them want to use you

{Y:i}Some of them want to get used by you

{Y:i}Some of them want to abuse you

00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:24,542
{Y:i}Some of them want to be abused...

{Y:i}Put the fucking team back in!

15
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,813
Turn me around.

16
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,791
Shit!

Subz done manually by majtjk0ng

18
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,381
Good run, Kable.

19
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,136
- My name is Tillman.
- Whatever your name is,

20
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:06,431
- you got to the save point fast.
- Who the fuck cares?

21
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,807
No one is getting out of here alive.

22
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,851
I am. I'm gonna make it out.

23
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,519
Sure you will.

24
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,606
They said you got 3 battles left
before you get out.

25
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,201
Bob!

26
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,660
Bob!

27
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,412
Alright, let me handle this.
Bob!

28
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,748
- Do we have the interview or don't we?
- Yes

29
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,166
We are a cunt-hair close.

30
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,585
Look I'm not going to blow the
3 Asian Wars for 'close'.

31
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,005
With all do respect, Bob,
nobody cares about dead Orientals.

32
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,759
- They care about Ken Castle.
- Can I hear from Gina, please?

33
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,386
Okay, Bob...

34
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,683
Bob, are you aware that Castle has clocked
exactly one media appearance date,

35
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:53,436
and that was Walter's last interview
before she died nine fucking years ago!

36
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,815
Stop menstruating and just tell me
whether we fucking have it?

37
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,109
We fucking, have it.

38
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,610
Good!

40
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,199
Okay, focus.
Let's get lunch.

41
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,659
Iranian, Sushi, or Mexican?

42
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,744
Uh, no.
Burger, chili fries?

43
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,538
I could freak a burger.

44
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,542
We live in Society.

45
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,044
We visit Society.

46
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,797
I mean, which one,...

47
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,925
.. which one's more real?
Really?

48
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,886
I mean, which one's really real?
Know what I mean?

49
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,269
{Y:i}You're watching
Gina Parker Smith

50
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,313
{Y:i}A live 'World Link Tonight' exclusive!

51
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,691
This motherfucker is
off the charts.

52
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,359
You realize he could
buy the network.

53
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,236
Yeah, why would he?
The son-of-a-bitch pulls in

54
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,822
650 millions pay-per-views

55
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:51,327
Going live in...
5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

56
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,998
{Y:i}First, there was "Society".

57
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,835
{Y:i}The ultimate SIM environment,
where players don't control

58
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,296
{Y:i}virtual animated characters,
but actual,

59
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,174
{Y:i}living, breathing, human beings.

60
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,261
{Y:i}They walked them. They talked them.
They juiced them. They rocked them.

61
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,763
Rickity-dickity-doo.

62
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,765
We had that on t-shirts
back in 2010.

63
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,768
{Y:i}The creation of reclusive genius
Ken Castle...

64
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,144
"Who is Ken Castle?"

65
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:17,979
{Y:i}"Society" took the
world by storm,

66
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,399
{Y:i}becoming the #1 guilty pleasure of billions.

67
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,485
You can get paid to be controlled,

68
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,612
or you can pay to control.

69
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,199
{Y:i}And generating one of the
world's largest private fortunes,

70
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,035
{Y:i}.. surpassing Bill Gates
practically, over night.

71
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:39,209
{Y:i}Nine months ago,
Castle availed a new simulation.

72
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,089
{Y:i}One that would take gaming to
new heights of thrilling excess...

73
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,133
{Y:i}.. and controversy.

75
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,260
{Y:i}Slayers.

00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,763
{Y:i}If "Society" let us
live through others,

77
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,183
{Y:i}"Slayers" would let us
die through others.

78
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:59,104
{Y:i}Slayers gives the gamer full
control of a flesh & blood human being,

79
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,648
{Y:i}in full scale kill or be killed combat.

80
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,817
{Y:i}And when we say "flesh and blood"

81
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,402
{Y:i}We mean, flesh...

82
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,029
{Y:i}and blood.

Slayers.

88
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,749
Slayers!

89
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,292
Why isn't it murder?

90
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,630
Gina, when was the last time you saw
somebody volunteer to be murdered?

91
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,426
I'm sure you know that every last one
of our Slayers is a bonified death row inmate.

92
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:33,138
Each one offered the chance to participate
as an alternative to their sentence.

93
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,473
You stay alive for 30 sessions,
you get set free.

94
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,933
That's not a bad goddamn deal.

95
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,939
And has any of these men or women have
actually survived long enough to be set free?

96
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,693
Well I'd remind the audience that Slayers
was put together with a full cooperation

97
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,112
and approval, of the United States
Federal government.

98
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,739
That the revenue that produces...

99
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,324
is responsible for funding
our entire prison system...

100
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,618
keeping the bad guys
behind bars.

101
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,122
And that the Prop. was voted
for by a cock-solid 68% of the American public.

102
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,000
In an election tainted by
a suspected digital fraud.

103
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,627
Let's talk about the
so called "Genericons",..

104
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,713
.. sent into the Slayers' environment,

105
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,800
With a set of pre programmed actions,
with no one controlling them,

106
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:11,885
.. and no way to react.

107
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,762
Their chances of survival are next to nil.

108
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,473
There's plenty of men and women in prison
who can never cut it as Slayers

109
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,810
shouldn't they be given the same chance
to roll the dice for a ticket out?

110
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,188
Besides they only need to survive
one session.

111
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,482
Right.

112
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,609
So Mr. Castle,
how the hell does it work?

113
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,696
It begins with a single nano cell
planted in the motor cortex of the brain.

114
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,991
This cell can replicate,

115
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,285
replacing the cells around it
with perfect copies.

116
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:42,624
And these copied cells contain
remote access functionality.

117
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,585
Therefore nano plus cortex,
equals a "nanex".

118
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,505
Isn't it true, that every human
that undergoes this procedure,

119
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,633
will have a distinct "IP" address,
like a mobile device...

120
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,635
- or a notebook computer?
- Similar, yeah.

121
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,345
But control is strictly localized

122
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,222
to the parameters of
our gaming environment.

123
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,599
You take "Society" for instance.

124
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,769
Once a cast member has left the workplace
they're completely free...

125
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,146
from the control and
monitoring of their player.

126
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,481
Oh well, that's a relief!

127
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,316
For some, maybe.

128
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,944
For some...

129
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:20,370
Don't you suspect a good many folks
wouldn't mind or need a bit of controlling?

130
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,788
Someone else making
all the decisions for you?

131
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,292
No tough choices?
No responsibilities?

132
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,048
- Think about it.
- We will, Mr. Castle.

133
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:33,758
We will!

134
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,221
{Y:i}The Gina Parker Smith Show!

{Y:i}SLAYERS

136
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,226
Good little talk?

137
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,603
Oh, shit!
My pleasure!

138
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,274
Can I just tell you, I cannot wait
until the next Slayers,

139
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,276
I mean, Kable has been unbelievable!

140
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,863
His arms are just so...
well I know they're terrible!

141
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,368
What the hell was that?

142
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,832
Ken Castle wants you to believe that
we are living in a better, safer world.

143
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:09,836
- His a liar! Mind controlling his Slayers...
- Mr. Castle, we have no idea where this is...

144
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,716
We will all be his dogs if we allowed
this evolution to continue.

145
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,476
That's a goddamn hoot!

146
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,854
This is nuts, it's like the signal is generating
simultaneously from six countries.

147
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:31,066
Bypass overload. Reroute to
the backup servers please, now.

148
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:31,858
Now!

149
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,154
Uh, Mr. Castle, we can't stop every
virus that sneaks in.

150
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,822
You might want to let my home boys
take a look at your firewall.

151
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,701
We're on it. They'll be off
the air momentarily.

152
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,245
So sorry.

153
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,000
What about you, sugar?

154
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,169
I wonder if I might breach your
firewall one of these days?

155
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,088
You're bad!

156
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,632
He's good!

157
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,050
Hit him!

158
00:11:57,676 --> 00:11:59,010
Fuck him up!

159
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,770
Get down!
Get the fuck down!

160
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:09,896
Get down! Get down!

161
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:07,704
{Y:i}Kable!

00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,415
{Y:i}Kable!

163
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,088
My name is Tillman.

164
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,677
Yeah yeah. Tillsman, Tillsman

165
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,054
They said your name was Tillsman.

166
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:27,932
You're just sitting, eh?.

167
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:32,771
Sitting and looking, just looking and sitting...
Just like me, man.

168
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,900
Keeping my wholes down,
you gotta keep your whole's down...

169
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,612
Everyday I do it, and then
everybody snaps, breaks...

170
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,906
starts to crack up, you know,
because you don't know if

171
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,492
you're going to live
a day or two or die.

172
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,370
Anybody but you, right?

173
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,414
27 battles, huh? Three to go...

174
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,834
Nobody has ever done it.
No man has ever come that close.

175
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,754
No one has even got 10 games
without getting their brain shot...

176
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:02,550
Everybody but Kable. Kable, because
he's sitting and looking, huh man?

177
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,928
You're gotta plan in your head.
You got a mission.

178
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,138
You never break.
You never snap.

179
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,643
You never say shit either, but you
take care of your business, don't you?

180
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:16,147
Niggers can get spooked by that kind of
single mindness, you know what I mean?

181
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,232
Cause you're spooky.

182
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,734
You spook me.

183
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:21,528
Whatcha in for?

184
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,738
{Y:i}You want to get back to them.

185
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,618
{Y:i}It's all you think about.
It's the only thing that keeps you alive.

186
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,370
Who's talking?

187
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,372
{Y:i}Sign it.

188
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,082
What?

189
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,211
{Y:i}Sign it. Please Tillman.

190
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,381
{Y:i}My son David is your biggest fan.
He prays for you.

191
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:17,394
{Y:i}I need to prove it's authentic.
Makes it worth more.

192
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,771
Why would anyone want my name?

193
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,357
{Y:i}You don't even know what's
going on out there, do you?

194
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,651
{Y:i}All medical personal
report to central process.

195
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,820
Damn, gotta go.
- No, wait! Wait!

196
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:30,115
How did you get this picture?
Have you seen them?

197
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,476
{Y:i}Sweat baby sweat baby
sex is a Texas drought.

198
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:02,272
{Y:i}Me and you do the kind of stuff
only Prince would sing about

199
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:06,192
{Y:i}So put your hands down my pants
and I bet you'll feel nuts

200
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,445
{Y:i}Yes I'm Siskel,
yes I'm Ebert

201
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,196
{Y:i}and you're getting
two thumbs up

202
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,034
{Y:i}Come quicker than FedEx never reach an apex,
just like Coca-Cola stock you are inclined,

203
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,161
{Y:i}To make me rise an hour early

204
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:19,164
{Y:i}just like Daylight Savings Time

205
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,751
{Y:i}You and me baby
ain't nothin' but mammals

206
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:26,880
{Y:i}So let's do it like they do
on the Discovery Channell. Do it again now.

207
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,425
{Y:i}You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it

208
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:34,262
{Y:i}like they do on the Discovery Channel
Gettin' horny now

209
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:01,456
Hey.

210
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,377
Hi.
- Hi.

211
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,130
So what's your damage?

212
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,389
You know, just hanging out.
Just looking to meet people.

213
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,099
...meet people.

214
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,354
Lucky you. You met me.

215
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:36,408
- I'm Nika.
- I'm Dale. I like your fur.

216
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:41,413
- Do you wanna go somewhere?
- Do you wanna go somewhere?

217
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,292
We are somewhere.

218
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:18,074
{Y:i}Ken Castle... Is a liar.
Liar!

219
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,493
Fuck!

220
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:23,079
{Y:i}A new video prank by
the subversive group Humanz...

221
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:25,498
{Y:i}caused a nation wide
stir today.

222
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,336
{Y:i}All contact between "Society" city, and
an estimated 3 quarters of a million players

223
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:32,547
{Y:i}were shut down for 3 hours
while Castle technicians

224
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:36,968
{Y:i}worked to remove what they described
as a "satellite infection"...

225
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,305
{Y:i}These pranks, at first,
attributed to rogue isolated hackers

226
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:44,017
{Y:i}are now suspected to be the work of
an elaborate and sophisticated,

227
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:47,604
{Y:i}network of programming cells,
spread around several countries.

228
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,689
{Y:i}Experts estimate that the service interruption

229
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:53,151
{Y:i}will end up costing Castle
billions in lost revenue.

230
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,403
{Y:i}Well don't cry for Castle,
he can cover this with

231
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,739
{Y:i}change in his couch cushions.

232
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:00,158
{Y:i}On a personal note,
that shit was fucked up.

233
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,411
{Y:i}Yeah it was.
I literally pissed myself.

234
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:05,205
{Y:i}Sounds like fun.

235
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:09,042
{Y:i}Seriously, these Humanz cock suckers,
they're are out of control.

236
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:22,305
- Sandra.
- Quiet.

237
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:28,770
- My name is Sandra.
- Stop talking.

238
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:15,103
{Y:i}They can't say
I didn't try...

239
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,757
Fuck yeah!

240
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,735
We're all going to die!

241
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,283
Oh God!

242
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:56,579
Let me out of here!

243
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:01,751
I'm not supposed to be here!

244
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:03,586
Who are they?

245
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:06,464
Who the fuck are they?

246
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:11,136
Who the fuck is playing us, man?

247
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:25,775
Shut up, fish.

248
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:57,891
Gay, gay, gay, tardily gay.

249
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:59,684
- Swarmers.
- Swarmers.

250
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,686
The latest innovation
from Browning,

251
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,521
this self detonating cartridge...

252
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,065
offers the widest
and deadliest spray available...

253
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,858
from a full tracking, cornering coordinates.

254
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,109
- Daddy like it.
- Simon!

255
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,570
Fan girl, stop hacking me.

256
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:13,823
You suck Simon. You're going to get
my boyfriend killed...

257
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:16,993
before he can get out of jail and
before he can fill me up with his hot seed!

258
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,703
Simon!
I just wanna play you.

259
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:21,206
- Forget about that star fucker.
- Shut up bitch!

260
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,417
So when am I going to get to meet you,
for like, real?

261
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,169
What's that?

262
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:28,797
What's up looser?

263
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:31,216
Mum says: Go to college,
move the fuck out, and...

264
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,802
And, oh yeah! You're a sick retard!
You're pathetic.

265
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,303
You smell like Jeffrey Dahmer.

266
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,180
- Wanna make out?
- You wish.

267
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:39,516
I can't wait until they
cut you out, Simian.

268
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:40,517
Your balls bitch.

269
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:41,559
- Simon?
- Maybe.

270
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,228
Oh my God! Is really you!

271
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:47,273
- Nice.
- Do you want to see our tits, Simon?

272
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:48,066
Yes, yes I do.

273
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:52,445
Now that we have your attention, here's
an offer that you can't refuse.

274
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,739
- Here we go.
- 50 million euros...

275
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,241
for control of Kable.

276
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:59,452
instant transfer to the account
of your choice.

277
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:01,329
Kable is not for sale,
thank you.

278
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,873
Baby, make it a hundred...

279
00:27:03,957 --> 00:27:04,833
It's been real!

280
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,675
What the fuck?

281
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:33,111
If you want to talk to Kable,
we can show you how.

282
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:38,992
Look at it.
The new face of Slayers.

283
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:41,411
Pure, crystalized horror,

284
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:43,997
two stories high and
bathed in bloody red.

285
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,041
He is what they want.

286
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:47,751
They love Kable.

287
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,127
They do now,

288
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:52,339
but when they watch their hero die
right in front of their eye balls...

289
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,840
so sharp and vivid...

290
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:56,843
if feels like it could've reach out and
touch the wet flesh.

291
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:01,139
They're going to change their point of view
and be seduced by the power...

292
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:04,934
.. the violence, the dominance.
It's human nature.

293
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:06,853
Kable's made it through 28 battles.

294
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:08,855
Every player in the game
is trying to take him out.

295
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:10,774
Yeah, Kable is a perfect soldier,

296
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:13,109
He's a tactical killing computer.

297
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:17,906
His only vulnerability is
the nanex itself. The...

298
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:19,783
delay between Simon's commands

299
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:22,952
and Kable's ability to execute.

300
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:25,121
So why should this one be any different?

301
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:27,832
Who controls him?

302
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,380
No one.

303
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:47,143
Get it out of me!

304
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:09,082
What the hell happened
to this one?

305
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:11,209
Looks like he escaped.

306
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:19,843
Hi girls. Back to your Jazzercise.

307
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,939
That's Hackman,
Hackman, Hackman, knack man.

308
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:35,525
They say he killed a
whole bunch of people, man.

309
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,610
Killed himself all kinds of people.

310
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:42,532
And then one day, he just walks up
and turns himself in...

311
00:29:42,574 --> 00:29:45,827
like he wants to be inside
or some crazy shit like that.

312
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,328
You know what I'm saying?

313
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,914
So it's going to be all
kinds of Slayers, man.

314
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:53,209
As long as you got motherfuckers like
that running around killing...

315
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:57,422
Kable! Let's go!
Upgrades, come on.

316
00:29:59,924 --> 00:30:01,092
Why don't you upgrade
a brother man?

317
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:04,471
Why don't you shut the fuck up?!

318
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,436
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

319
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:14,022
Fucking, shut the fuck up.

320
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:43,927
- Who wimps?
- What?

321
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:47,681
Who wimps,
The player or the slayer?

322
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:51,935
I am the hand.

323
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,481
Someone, somewhere else is the eye.

324
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:59,275
It's tripped out, man.

325
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:04,864
Sometimes, they take over...
completely, they...

326
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:07,659
move you around like a robot.

327
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:11,037
- But that don't work so good.
- Why?

328
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,581
The delay.

329
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:17,210
Yeah the ping.
They talk about that.

330
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:20,880
About how long it takes the
Slayer to respond to the command.

331
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:23,299
Whatever they call it,

332
00:31:23,341 --> 00:31:28,596
the slice of a second out there,
is the difference between living and dying.

333
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:32,100
When that trigger pulls...

334
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:39,232
.. it's just me.

335
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:00,670
Hey, Kable.

336
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:03,923
Look.

337
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:06,843
I just killed someone.

338
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:10,805
This is the blood.

339
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:14,184
Look.

340
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,773
He's back here.

341
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:21,816
Wanna see?

342
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:26,196
You know your head ain't on straight.

343
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:34,287
I'm going to kill you too,
on Sunday.

344
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:35,955
Yeah, probably.

345
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:37,457
That's why they put me here.

346
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:39,668
I got no strings.

347
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:44,798
I got no strings,
so I have fun.

348
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,802
I'm not tied up to anyone.

349
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:54,015
They got strings,
but you can see,

350
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:59,646
there are no strings on me.

351
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,149
You go two whores, Kable.

352
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:06,361
- What the fuck did you say?
- On the outside.

353
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:11,991
I'm sorry,
I meant your pretty girls.

354
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:16,788
So you want to get back to them.

355
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,207
But I'm going to visit them first.

356
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,386
Alright.

357
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:40,854
Kable.

358
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:46,026
Kable, dude. It's me.
It's me.

359
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,193
Who?

360
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:50,363
Simon, I'm playing you.

361
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:54,325
- How come I can hear you?
- Well, it's a mod.

362
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:56,786
Gamers can't talk to cons.

363
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:58,413
I know.

364
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:02,250
It's fucking unbelievable.
This is amazing.

365
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,518
Cool yeah?

366
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,312
No it's not cool.

367
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:25,940
Pay attention to the fucking game!

368
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:36,618
Okay, okay.
I got it, I got it.

369
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:37,952
What are you, 12?

370
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:40,955
I'm 17 actually,
thank you.

371
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:48,880
This is unbelievable.

372
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,299
How am I not dead yet?

373
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:54,761
Cause I'm a badass,
motherfucker.

374
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,026
Shit!

375
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:18,410
Freak, you shouldn't be here.

376
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:43,018
- Gibs.
- What?

377
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:46,938
Like giblets -Kibbles and Bits -
Chunks - Pieces everywhere.

378
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,482
These are real humans fucker.

379
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:58,700
Death row, psychos... so what?

380
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,327
They had it coming anyway, right?

381
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:16,885
I guess that goes for me too.

382
00:36:16,926 --> 00:36:18,970
Yeah, but you're different.

383
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:21,973
Different, how?

384
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:24,684
I don't know, because
you're my psych.

385
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:27,562
Damn new area.

386
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:36,404
Think about it Kable, all the shit
we've been through together,

387
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:39,115
what an epic run, man.

388
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:41,284
It's gonna suck to see it end.

389
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:42,994
Are you fucking kidding me?

390
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:46,498
Oh yeah, I get that for you it's different.

391
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:51,503
This way.

392
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:57,175
- There's nothing there.
- Trust me, kid.

393
00:36:57,342 --> 00:37:00,303
It's restricted area. It's beyond
the borders of the game

394
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:01,846
I couldn't put you there if I tried.

395
00:37:01,888 --> 00:37:02,931
Warning.

396
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:04,557
Access denied.

397
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:17,696
Shit.

398
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:31,668
Bye, Kable.

399
00:37:47,058 --> 00:37:47,809
Come on.

400
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,562
This kid's going to get me killed.

401
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:53,523
Dude I'm right here, man.
I can hear you.

402
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:56,067
Listen to me.

403
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:58,695
I don't know who's behind it or why,

404
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:02,657
but I was supposed to die tonight.
Lucky for us,

405
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:05,368
I can beat them...

406
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,412
but not with you controlling me.

407
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:09,080
What the hell are you talking about?

408
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:13,752
Turn me lose, kid.
You want to win? Turn me lose.

409
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:15,628
Find a way.

410
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,090
Bastard.

411
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:30,602
So Ms Roth. Says here you're
applying for custody of your daughter?

412
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:33,605
Delia, her name is Delia.

413
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:36,358
Spouse incarcerated. Life, without the possibility of parole.

414
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:39,694
- You use your maiden name?
- Uh-huh.

415
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:43,073
My husband... he's...

416
00:38:43,114 --> 00:38:46,326
it's not entirely true
regarding his sentence.

417
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,661
In fact,
he's due to be released soon.

418
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:52,999
Ms. Roth,
your husband was charged and con...

419
00:38:55,168 --> 00:38:57,545
He was charged and convicted
of first degree murder.

420
00:38:57,587 --> 00:39:00,256
I can't hardly
consider his release,

421
00:39:00,298 --> 00:39:04,761
if it were to happen at all..
I don't think it would be a good thing.

422
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:09,516
So it's says you're an actor?

423
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:13,520
I don't know that I've
seen you in anything.

424
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:15,480
I work in "Society".

425
00:39:17,732 --> 00:39:18,525
It's a job.

426
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,903
Ms. Roth, your child has been exceedingly well placed.

427
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:24,823
The new family is very wealthy,
She will never want for anything.

428
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:27,867
Now I can understand that
you love your daughter.

429
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:32,038
Probably very much. But do you really
think she would be better off...

430
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,165
with...

431
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:35,959
people like you?

432
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:41,881
Yes, I do.
I'm her mother.

433
00:39:44,926 --> 00:39:48,805
We will give your application on
the consideration of merits.

438
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:20,086
Do you like the software?

439
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:21,671
Software?

440
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:23,506
The walkie talkie, player.

441
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:24,716
No shit.

442
00:40:25,925 --> 00:40:28,178
You're the guy from the TV,
the Humanz.

443
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:29,804
That's right, baby.

444
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:32,057
You think about
what the brother said?

445
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:34,642
To what brother do you refer,
brother?

446
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:36,978
Kable wants the freedom to ass kick.

447
00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:38,480
Do shit his way.

448
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:40,940
- Are you going to give it to him?
- You were listening?

449
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:43,193
We see and hear everything...

450
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:46,029
everything that goes on inside
that so called game.

451
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:49,532
Alright then,
Kable said we got lucky...

452
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:51,785
They were gunning for us.
What's that all about?

453
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:53,995
Kable got a past,
he knows things.

454
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:56,039
Things you don't even know.

455
00:40:57,165 --> 00:40:59,793
- What things?
- Things that Castle is afraid of.

456
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:03,588
As long as your boy stays on the inside,
Castle knows he can keep him quiet.

457
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:08,677
But if he ever got out... Castle
would never let that happen.

458
00:41:08,718 --> 00:41:09,552
There's one battle left,

459
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:12,347
I think I can handle my own business,
thank you very much.

460
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:13,181
You're not hearing me.

461
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:15,183
This is not something you can control.

462
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:18,728
They're gonna kill his ass, Simon.

463
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:21,064
In the eyes of the world,
and then what?

464
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:23,775
You're just another poor
little rich honky.

465
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:28,154
No cable, no pussy, no shit.

466
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:34,994
Look man, this... this is too heavy. I don't
even know what the hell are you talking about.

467
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:38,081
- I just play games, man. Games.
- That's right.

468
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:39,874
It is a game.
You want to win, don't you?

469
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:41,376
Yeah, I intend to.

470
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:43,503
Then you need to cut your
strings puppet master.

471
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:47,507
Imagine a slayer that don't got
to wait to be told what to do.

472
00:41:47,924 --> 00:41:49,300
No ping, you dig?

473
00:41:50,927 --> 00:41:51,845
That would be cheating.

474
00:41:52,303 --> 00:41:53,847
A mod.
That's all it would be.

475
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:57,559
You know why?
Because the game's got to evolve.

476
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:01,229
- You feel me?
- I do.

477
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:04,691
I do feel you my,
giant brother.

478
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:06,443
Well then,
let's rock baby.

479
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:17,996
{Y:i}Tillman...
he knows you talked to him.

480
00:42:18,913 --> 00:42:20,915
{Y:i}Your player.

481
00:42:25,378 --> 00:42:26,171
Who are you?

482
00:42:26,546 --> 00:42:27,213
{Y:i}A friend.

483
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:30,842
I don't have any.

484
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:32,427
{Y:i}Listen to me.

485
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:37,015
{Y:i}Simon is going to give you what you want.
What you asked him for.

486
00:42:40,352 --> 00:42:41,102
How do you know that?

487
00:42:41,686 --> 00:42:42,479
{Y:i}I know something else.

488
00:42:43,563 --> 00:42:45,190
{Y:i}Whether or not he's controlling you,

489
00:42:45,273 --> 00:42:48,193
{Y:i}you will never reach the save point.

490
00:42:48,276 --> 00:42:49,903
{Y:i}Castle won't allow it.

491
00:42:49,944 --> 00:42:51,237
We'll see.

492
00:42:51,404 --> 00:42:52,739
{Y:i}No, you have to escape.

493
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:55,325
{Y:i}Your wife and your
daughter need you, Tillman.

494
00:42:57,285 --> 00:42:58,870
{Y:i}If you want to get out and see
the people in the picture...

495
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,373
{Y:i}you will have to find another way.

496
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,796
I need you to get me something.

497
00:43:09,547 --> 00:43:11,925
{Y:i}What? Tell me.

498
00:43:13,176 --> 00:43:16,346
Drunk.

499
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:01,266
What have you got there?

500
00:44:01,307 --> 00:44:03,476
Kable, what the hell is that?

501
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:13,445
Put it down.

502
00:44:14,612 --> 00:44:16,281
Put it down!

503
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:23,872
Fuck face!
Throw the bottle in the trash!

504
00:44:43,308 --> 00:44:47,020
Oh, I see it was a great idea
turning you loose.

505
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,405
- What happened?
- You happened!

506
00:44:57,447 --> 00:45:00,408
You wanted control,
you got it.

507
00:45:12,545 --> 00:45:16,257
What's the matter with you, Kable?
Kill something!

508
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:42,492
This is unbelievable.

509
00:45:42,534 --> 00:45:45,120
Kable, listen.
This is the last game

510
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:48,123
you're going to end up dead and I'm
going to look like a total asshole...

511
00:45:48,164 --> 00:45:51,126

00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:55,964
Damn it!

513

Kable, what the hell are you doing?

514
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:35,378
Aw, what the hell?

515
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:39,924
That's just gross, bro.

516
00:47:10,121 --> 00:47:11,581
Go, go, go, go!

00:47:11,623 --> 00:47:15,126
I'm not your fucking cheerleader!
