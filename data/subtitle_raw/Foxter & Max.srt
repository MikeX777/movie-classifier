1
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,542
Still in bed?
It's 7 a.m., Max.

2
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,334
Can we get a dog?

3
00:02:09,543 --> 00:02:10,544
Have you seen your room?

4
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:13,418
Do you want to add a dog
to this whole bazaar?

5
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,335
But one day can we?

6
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:18,378
I just answered you.

7
00:02:18,544 --> 00:02:21,878
You can't even
take care of your room,

8
00:02:22,045 --> 00:02:24,629
let alone a living being,
let's not talk about it.

9
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,837
The report has been on
Neretin's desk since yesterday.

10
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,961
The meeting is at 10 a.m.

11
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:40,504
Have a good day !

12
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:42,671
Do your dishes.
I'm leaving now.

13
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:19,049
As you know,

14
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:22,509
my nanobots
are able to grow

15
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:26,717
and change shape
on command.

16
00:03:26,926 --> 00:03:30,467
Whether to block
a virus that is constantly evolving ...

17
00:03:35,052 --> 00:03:38,928
 or to create an organic firewall
to counter hackers ...

18
00:03:45,804 --> 00:03:47,638
or to provide protection

19
00:03:47,804 --> 00:03:51,554
for databases that contain
top-secret information ...

20
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:59,096
Nothing and no one is more reliable
and efficient than my nanobots.

21
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:06,638
When will
the field tests start ?

22
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:08,721
I will be ready
in a few days.

23
00:04:09,096 --> 00:04:11,180
The data will follow
soon after.

24
00:04:12,014 --> 00:04:15,557
Consider your funding to be extended.

25
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:28,223
Don't celebrate victory too quickly.

26
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:31,599
We are not sure
that nanobots

27
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:35,934
adapt as quickly to real conditions
as they do in theory.

28
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:06,977
Sorry, may I come in?

29
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:08,061
Come in.

30
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,312
I hope you have a good excuse.

31
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,979
Watch where you walk, loser.

32
00:05:20,104 --> 00:05:23,064
Enough, both of you.
Focus on your textbooks.

33
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:35,314
Complex nanotechnology.

34
00:05:35,481 --> 00:05:39,191
which can transform endlessly,
the ultimate hacker.

35
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,607
It exists !

36
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:42,899
And should that interest me?

37
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:45,398
It can infiltrate
security systems.

38
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:47,316
It's a
kind of technology ...

39
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:49,482
alive,
like mercury.

40
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:53,317
It can hack into banks,
stock market prices ...

41
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:55,193
This is serious.

42
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:57,983
Go get Gecko.

43
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,567
The lake is asleep,
just like the forest and the reeds.

44
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:08,068
As the willow creaked ...

45
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:13,194
As the willow creaked ...

46
00:06:14,902 --> 00:06:15,820
Where's the willow?

47
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,778
Sleep! Sleep!

48
00:06:21,652 --> 00:06:24,945
I had wonderful dreams,
cloaked in white.

49
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:28,612
In their silver case rested
sparkling stones.

50
00:06:29,362 --> 00:06:32,112
On a carpet
made of grass and flowers ...

51
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,153
I was sleeping,

52
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,904
my breathing
lifted my chest ...

53
00:06:53,655 --> 00:06:55,364
Have you lost your mind, you moron?

54
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,698
Are you drawing my girlfriend?

55
00:06:58,282 --> 00:06:59,782
What is this ?

56
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:01,200
I will teach you a lesson about staring.

57
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:03,490
Hold this!

58
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:06,534
... pure and sparkling white.

59
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:10,991
The silent and tender stars
fell from the heavens ...

60
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,325
What is going on ?

61
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:21,910
Skoryk!

62
00:07:22,952 --> 00:07:24,575
Are you trying to set the school on fire?

63
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,368
To the principal's!

64
00:07:35,743 --> 00:07:36,868
Come on, my little ones.

65
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,911
To bed.

66
00:07:46,162 --> 00:07:47,744
I hate
new technologies.

67
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:51,162
They will send me
straight to a museum.

68
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,496
No museum will want you.
You talk too much.

69
00:08:00,705 --> 00:08:02,371
Sweet dreams my particles

70
00:08:03,955 --> 00:08:08,290
I could easily break
into the laboratory, but ...

71
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,581
this safe ...

72
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:15,706
It's a state-of-the-art,
fireproof vault

73
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,165
with 5 cm steel walls

74
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,457
and an advanced alarm system.

75
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:25,041
At that level, I can not guarantee anything.

76
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,708
No...

77
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:31,333
No, forget your guarantees.

78
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:33,291
Refresh my memory,

79
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:35,624
why are you working for me

80
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,085
Because I am the best.

81
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:41,085
No.

82
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:45,127
The real reason, clever boy.

83
00:08:48,835 --> 00:08:52,751
That is what I thought.
So bring me those nanobots.

84
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,712
He was drawing all night again ...

85
00:09:07,462 --> 00:09:09,712
And dirty dishes, as usual.

86
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:13,004
Sorry, darling,
but you can't have a dog.

87
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:06,725
LOGIN
PASSWORD

88
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:39,144
The system is ready.

89
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:54,855
Alert...

90
00:12:05,106 --> 00:12:05,897
Stop !

91
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:44,491
Don't move.

92
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,580
Strange ...

93
00:14:35,497 --> 00:14:36,748
I do not know this brand.

94
00:15:44,212 --> 00:15:45,379
Did you do that ?

95
00:15:45,962 --> 00:15:47,005
Yes...

96
00:15:47,171 --> 00:15:48,088
Cool.

97
00:15:49,463 --> 00:15:52,088
Your tag is really ... excellent.

98
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:54,880
Thank you.

99
00:15:58,713 --> 00:15:59,921
Did you hear that?

100
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:01,464
You're cool !

101
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,427
An idea came to my mind.

102
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:49,594
What if we separated ...

103
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,219
from our business partners?

104
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:57,970
All the serious players
have switched to cryptocurrency.

105
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:00,221
It's a virtual currency,
online

106
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:02,720
You just have to find
a way to extract it.

107
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,763
A perfect mission for nanobots.
I am a genius !

108
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,931
As promised...

109
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,681
It's empty.

110
00:17:29,266 --> 00:17:30,391
What do you mean ?

111
00:17:34,932 --> 00:17:36,306
What is this thing ?

112
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,349
Where are the robots?

113
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,935
Everyone will know
the name of Myron.

114
00:18:13,394 --> 00:18:15,145
Everyone will respect me.

115
00:18:15,353 --> 00:18:17,104
And will be afraid of me.

116
00:18:17,812 --> 00:18:20,771
With these nanobots,
I will finally have the power!

117
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:27,437
Read and sign, please.

118
00:18:32,355 --> 00:18:34,188
So, did we do something stupid?

119
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:36,939
Now you will definitely be handed over
to the the museum!

120
00:18:37,314 --> 00:18:39,274
Shut up you stupid tin can.

121
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,232
What happened?

122
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:42,564
I did not see anything.

123
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,275
Skyba.

124
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:56,776
Yes.

125
00:18:56,984 --> 00:18:58,774
A burglar
broke into the lab.

126
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,941
Security agents
chased him, but he escaped.

127
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:08,067
The police are viewing
the video surveillance footage.

128
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:12,692
I'm sure it will help us
find our robots.

129
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:16,317
Or at least the
one who stole them.

130
00:19:16,526 --> 00:19:17,568
No.

131
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:19,985
These are my nanobots.
My creations.

132
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:23,111
I know
how they think and operate.

133
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:24,777
I will find them on my own.

134
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,531
What happened here?

135
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,244
How clumsy you are!

136
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:09,039
Is that your case?

137
00:22:34,338 --> 00:22:37,213
I said
that new technologies

138
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:38,506
were a source of trouble.

139
00:22:38,714 --> 00:22:40,423
They are easy targets for theives.

140
00:22:46,508 --> 00:22:50,966
I should hire him
as a security consultant ...

141
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:05,384
What is that ?

142
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:07,134
A pulse neutralizer.

143
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:09,759
It detects
electromagnetic waves,

144
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:12,842
it can deactivate
any device

145
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:14,092
and separate nanobots.

146
00:23:14,302 --> 00:23:16,094
Put them in immobility mode,

147
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,260
or turn them off.

148
00:23:17,468 --> 00:23:18,344
Encoding completed.

149
00:23:18,511 --> 00:23:20,468
COMPLETED

150
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:09,974
Given my budget, I think
my only option is theft.

151
00:24:14,557 --> 00:24:17,016
Theft: taking possession
of the property of others

152
00:24:17,183 --> 00:24:19,767
Society: punished by law
Buddhism: bad karma

153
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:22,684
Christianity:
ass thrown into the flames of hell

154
00:24:47,227 --> 00:24:48,269
Hey, kid!

155
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:50,478
Are you stealing from me or what?

156
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:03,103
Thief !

157
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,648
Alert: nanoactivity located.

158
00:25:13,065 --> 00:25:14,565
Well...

159
00:25:27,857 --> 00:25:28,983
That's weird ...

160
00:25:29,524 --> 00:25:31,317
They could have repainted
over it.

161
00:25:31,775 --> 00:25:34,400
Why would anyone do that ?
It's a work of art!

162
00:25:34,943 --> 00:25:35,941
Hello.

163
00:25:40,317 --> 00:25:43,484
Your brain is producing an excess
of cortisol and adrenaline,

164
00:25:43,693 --> 00:25:46,109
which is increasing
your heart rate.

165
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,818
How can you be here?

166
00:25:49,318 --> 00:25:51,234
You have to calm down.

167
00:25:51,401 --> 00:25:54,193
Start by breathing.
Do like me.

168
00:25:58,694 --> 00:26:01,570
He seems to confuse
breathing and singing.

169
00:26:02,236 --> 00:26:05,446
Maybe I should have begun
artificial respiration?

170
00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:23,156
Can I help you ?

171
00:26:24,781 --> 00:26:28,613
I need to see
the pictures from the last hour.

172
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:30,280
Are you from the police?

173
00:26:30,697 --> 00:26:31,823
No.

174
00:26:32,031 --> 00:26:33,739
Then I must ask you to leave.

175
00:26:41,864 --> 00:26:42,864
Thank you.

176
00:26:56,659 --> 00:26:58,951
Extracting
surveillance data .

177
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:01,660
DOWNLOAD

178
00:27:05,951 --> 00:27:07,618
I must be hallucinating ...

179
00:27:20,952 --> 00:27:23,120
To answer your question

180
00:27:23,286 --> 00:27:26,204
about my presence here,
it's simple:

181
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:28,954
you created
me by spraying me out of the canister

182
00:27:29,162 --> 00:27:31,161
in the form of graffiti.

183
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:32,786
But it was just paint.

184
00:27:32,912 --> 00:27:33,829
False.

185
00:27:33,995 --> 00:27:38,038
I am made
of microscopic nanobots.

186
00:27:38,246 --> 00:27:41,580
You wanted paint,
so I changed.

187
00:27:41,788 --> 00:27:45,081
You wanted to paint a robot dog,
so I became a robot dog.

188
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:49,497
I am programmed
to serve my creator.

189
00:27:52,581 --> 00:27:53,497
Your creator?

190
00:27:53,581 --> 00:27:55,664
You created me, Max.

191
00:27:55,872 --> 00:27:57,372
You said I was cool.

192
00:27:58,249 --> 00:28:01,249
Wait ...
So the fight at school ...

193
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:04,748
It was you
who fought you with my bag?

194
00:28:04,915 --> 00:28:08,083
Your hypothalamus sent
a signal to your nervous system

195
00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:11,374
which I interpreted
as a desire to beat them.

196
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:13,625
And I helped you a little ...

197
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:15,875
Wait, and at the store ...

198
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:18,624
At the store I kept you
from committing a crime

199
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:20,500
to avoid bad karma

200
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:23,625
and your ass being thrown
into the flames of hell.

201
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,709
By the way
what is "ass?"

202
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:29,168
That is what you used
instead of your head!

203
00:28:29,336 --> 00:28:32,252
Not only
do I no longer have any pens,

204
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,128
but I'm going to be in trouble
with this bully, Dan.

205
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,377
- Hide.
- To hide...

206
00:28:42,586 --> 00:28:46,045
is to make sure
that you can't see me anymore.

207
00:28:46,545 --> 00:28:49,588
I can do that.
"Invisible" mode activated.

208
00:28:52,172 --> 00:28:53,214
Hi Dad.

209
00:28:53,422 --> 00:28:56,045
Sorry,
I have an urgent call to make.

210
00:28:59,921 --> 00:29:02,130
Which of us
is more invisible?

211
00:29:02,296 --> 00:29:04,089
The "invisible" mode is working.

212
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:11,380
Where are you ?

213
00:29:15,423 --> 00:29:16,340
In here ?

214
00:29:21,757 --> 00:29:22,674
Bizarre ...

215
00:29:25,925 --> 00:29:27,549
I really did hallucinate.

216
00:29:34,717 --> 00:29:36,718
Drawing contest.

217
00:29:36,926 --> 00:29:38,051
The grand prize :

218
00:29:38,218 --> 00:29:41,093
one year of training
at Levram Studios.

219
00:29:41,301 --> 00:29:44,467
Today is the last day
to submit your application.

220
00:29:44,675 --> 00:29:47,218
I have no chance of winning ...

221
00:29:48,802 --> 00:29:50,802
So what's the point of trying?

222
00:29:52,427 --> 00:29:54,595
Hey, kid!
Are you stealing from me or what?

223
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,428
What are you making,
my little robots?

224
00:30:15,263 --> 00:30:16,388
Your coffee.

225
00:30:16,846 --> 00:30:18,137
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

226
00:30:21,262 --> 00:30:24,513
Alert!
Nanoactivity located nearby.

227
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:26,638
There you are...

228
00:30:48,225 --> 00:30:49,974
UPLOAD

229
00:31:11,643 --> 00:31:12,602
Hi.

230
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:14,394
This is a cool place you have here.

231
00:31:15,478 --> 00:31:16,686
Say ...

232
00:31:16,894 --> 00:31:19,520
I'm looking for the tagger
who signs like this.

233
00:31:20,229 --> 00:31:21,770
Doesn't ring a bell.

234
00:31:27,145 --> 00:31:28,186
Nope.

235
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:37,938
Can we play ?

236
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,395
Max !

237
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,438
You created a dog.

238
00:31:42,481 --> 00:31:45,897
So let's do
human-dog activities!

239
00:31:46,106 --> 00:31:50,482
According to my analysis, the park seems to be
full of popular activities.

240
00:31:51,273 --> 00:31:52,148
Max...

241
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:57,023
But ... you disappeared yesterday.

242
00:31:58,232 --> 00:31:59,441
My "invisible" mode?

243
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:01,398
You told me to hide.

244
00:32:03,691 --> 00:32:05,399
- Do you want us to go to the park?
- Yes.

245
00:32:05,608 --> 00:32:07,692
- Like that?
- Like that what?

246
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,275
Did you look at yourself?

247
00:32:09,985 --> 00:32:12,441
I thought
you made me look cool.

248
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:16,316
Yes, it's true.
You're cool.

249
00:32:16,524 --> 00:32:19,110
- It's just that ...
- My tail?

250
00:32:19,318 --> 00:32:21,901
What's wrong
with my tail?

251
00:32:22,401 --> 00:32:24,193
Nothing, let me finish.

252
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:28,319
It's just that you don't look ...
like a real dog.

253
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,943
I think I understand.

254
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:34,069
You want me to look

255
00:32:34,236 --> 00:32:37,278
like a real fox terrier, right?

256
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:40,278
- Exactly.
- No problem.

257
00:32:41,738 --> 00:32:43,529
It is true ?
You can do that?

258
00:32:43,696 --> 00:32:44,613
Yes.

259
00:32:50,612 --> 00:32:52,070
Can we play now?

260
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:54,446
Yes, we can play.

261
00:32:54,613 --> 00:32:56,405
But we would need a leash.

262
00:32:56,614 --> 00:32:58,197
No problem, Max.

263
00:33:09,365 --> 00:33:11,448
Behave like a real dog.

264
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,866
You promised me.

265
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,655
Anything you want, Max.

266
00:33:29,826 --> 00:33:31,450
My information was correct,

267
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:34,119
activities at the park
are fun!

268
00:33:34,327 --> 00:33:35,576
Are you crazy or what ?

269
00:33:35,784 --> 00:33:37,118
Don't speak in public!

270
00:33:37,326 --> 00:33:39,243
Someone is going to have
a heart attack.

271
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,534
You think ?

272
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:51,909
I have an idea.

273
00:33:55,828 --> 00:33:57,703
Max, put this on.

274
00:33:59,745 --> 00:34:01,871
Max, Foxter, here, over ...

275
00:34:02,786 --> 00:34:03,704
So ?

276
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,496
- Very good !
- You're telling me.

277
00:34:16,497 --> 00:34:19,122
Max, what are they doing?

278
00:34:20,247 --> 00:34:23,499
What strange and irrational behavior !

279
00:34:23,707 --> 00:34:24,706
Don't worry, it's nothing.

280
00:34:24,873 --> 00:34:26,998
This is how
dogs greet each other.

281
00:34:32,415 --> 00:34:34,999
Go on, get to know them.

282
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,165
Okay.

283
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:39,250
So...

284
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:41,874
Let's see, how to do this ...

285
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:44,457
Okay.

286
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,125
Sorry to bother you ...

287
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:49,042
Well.

288
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,959
This is really weird.

289
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:59,584
Max, something's wrong.
Nobody wants to play with me.

290
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:01,959
Just like me at school ...

291
00:35:02,376 --> 00:35:04,043
Did you sniff their backside?

292
00:35:05,085 --> 00:35:06,086
Yes.

293
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:09,919
It's your smell !
You don't smell like a dog.

294
00:35:10,337 --> 00:35:13,503
You are smart!
For a human.

295
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,087
I'll reproduce
the olfactory molecules ...

296
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,879
It worked, Max!

297
00:35:26,462 --> 00:35:28,214
Hello sir...

298
00:35:30,006 --> 00:35:31,420
Nice to meet you.

299
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,670
This is really cool, Max!

300
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:39,213
It's great to be a dog.
You should try.

301
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:20,302
You have to
clean up behind me.

302
00:36:21,092 --> 00:36:22,801
I won't touch your poop.

303
00:36:22,968 --> 00:36:25,885
But that is part of the role
of a dog owner!

304
00:36:26,344 --> 00:36:27,593
I don't have a bag.

305
00:36:27,761 --> 00:36:29,636
Use your hand.

306
00:36:30,969 --> 00:36:33,469
They are not even real.
Come on, Max.

307
00:36:35,052 --> 00:36:36,887
- Go on ...
- It's okay.

308
00:36:42,428 --> 00:36:44,929
Come on, Max, pick them up.

309
00:36:46,054 --> 00:36:47,304
Come on !

310
00:36:49,347 --> 00:36:51,265
And here is
an extraordinary discovery:

311
00:36:51,473 --> 00:36:53,097
the very first flying poop!

312
00:36:53,305 --> 00:36:55,305
Make
sure it's mine ...

313
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:56,889
I've got you !

314
00:36:56,972 --> 00:36:58,054
It looks like mine.

315
00:36:58,263 --> 00:36:59,139
Max ?

316
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:01,389
What is that ?

317
00:37:02,973 --> 00:37:04,098
Nothing special.

318
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:06,807
Oh, how cute!

319
00:37:08,265 --> 00:37:09,432
Is this your dog ?

320
00:37:09,641 --> 00:37:10,514
Yes it is.

321
00:37:10,723 --> 00:37:12,056
My REAL dog.

322
00:37:12,265 --> 00:37:13,598
From muzzle to tail.

323
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:17,266
She's nice...

324
00:37:18,224 --> 00:37:19,266
What is his name ?

325
00:37:19,682 --> 00:37:20,558
Foxter.

326
00:37:20,683 --> 00:37:21,892
His name is Foxter.

327
00:37:22,932 --> 00:37:24,391
Sonia !

328
00:37:26,766 --> 00:37:29,225
We're going to the Art Platform.

329
00:37:29,392 --> 00:37:30,850
See you later.

330
00:37:31,392 --> 00:37:33,183
Bye, Foxter.

331
00:37:33,808 --> 00:37:34,809
Bye, bye

332
00:37:38,144 --> 00:37:41,435
So Max, I perceive
a large secretion of dopamine!

333
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:45,060
And your serotonin level
is exploding.

334
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:46,185
Shut up.

335
00:37:46,352 --> 00:37:48,309
It appears that you like her.

336
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:50,185
I have no chance with her.

337
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,395
Maybe you should
sniff her behind?

338
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:55,021
It could work.

339
00:37:58,104 --> 00:38:01,436
Max, I have the impression that
relationship problems between humans

340
00:38:01,645 --> 00:38:03,978
are due to their lack of tails.

341
00:38:04,187 --> 00:38:07,313
Why are you so sure you don't
have a chance?

342
00:38:07,522 --> 00:38:09,604
Because she already has
a boyfriend, Dan.

343
00:38:09,812 --> 00:38:11,773
What is a "boyfriend Dan"?

344
00:38:11,981 --> 00:38:14,772
A bully who spoils my life.

345
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,896
She told you
she was going to the Art Platform.

346
00:38:18,104 --> 00:38:19,897
According to my information,

347
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:23,438
it's a place
where young humans go

348
00:38:23,648 --> 00:38:25,649
to spend
their parents' money.

349
00:38:26,065 --> 00:38:27,024
So what ?

350
00:38:27,273 --> 00:38:28,190
So what...

351
00:38:29,524 --> 00:38:31,191
I may have an idea.

352
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:33,399
An idea ?

353
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:37,066
I can't believe it.

354
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,567
Nanobots
have turned into dog.

355
00:38:41,775 --> 00:38:44,941
They are programmed to take
the form of the desire of their master.

356
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:48,151
If this boy wanted a dog,
that would explain everything.

357
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:52,191
The most amazing thing is that the dog
seems to lead, not the boy.

358
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,275
It means

359
00:38:53,401 --> 00:38:55,609
that the
artificial intelligence module is working.

360
00:39:03,402 --> 00:39:05,694
No I do not know him.

361
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:16,862
Hello?

362
00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:18,404
What are you doing ?

363
00:39:19,363 --> 00:39:20,488
I'm investigating.

364
00:39:21,946 --> 00:39:24,030
Do you think you are Sherlock Holmes?

365
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,570
- Look, I'm trying to ...
- Are you trying ?

366
00:39:29,237 --> 00:39:31,780
If I don't get
the nanobots today,

367
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:34,614
I'll fold you into a small package ...

368
00:39:34,823 --> 00:39:37,072
and I ship you to Timbuktu.

369
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:38,740
It is very far.

370
00:39:39,196 --> 00:39:40,156
Got it?

371
00:39:47,657 --> 00:39:48,823
What are we doing here?

372
00:39:49,032 --> 00:39:49,991
You will see.

373
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,283
Trust me.

374
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:07,660
Weird, why do I have the
urge to catch these bubbles?

375
00:40:19,952 --> 00:40:22,827
Max, look,
she's in the crowd.

376
00:40:23,452 --> 00:40:25,078
Is that boy sick?

377
00:40:25,287 --> 00:40:27,621
The one who making
the weird movements?

378
00:40:28,578 --> 00:40:29,451
He's dancing.

379
00:40:30,202 --> 00:40:32,661
I see ...
And wouldn't that be Dan the bully?

380
00:40:48,288 --> 00:40:50,830
This funny behavior
begins to please me.

381
00:41:16,125 --> 00:41:17,918
- Let's move on.
- Hold on.

382
00:41:18,126 --> 00:41:22,000
Congratulations to the winner
of this battle!

383
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:25,000
Give him a hand!

384
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:27,625
I analyzed
what captivates the girls.

385
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,252
I know how to
get her attention.

386
00:41:30,418 --> 00:41:32,750
We need a quiet place.

387
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:39,459
Did you know, your haircut is
called a "bowl cut".

388
00:41:39,669 --> 00:41:41,210
The rest,
you don't need to know.

389
00:41:41,419 --> 00:41:43,002
Children's problems
are so complex.

390
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,752
Here. This is good.

391
00:41:51,296 --> 00:41:52,961
What is your plan?

392
00:42:06,338 --> 00:42:08,006
No, no...

393
00:42:08,212 --> 00:42:09,296
Why not.

394
00:42:11,422 --> 00:42:12,338
Here.

395
00:42:37,592 --> 00:42:38,301
Cool.

396
00:42:51,385 --> 00:42:52,260
Yep!

397
00:42:56,803 --> 00:42:58,843
And the final touch ...
That's it.

398
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:01,552
According to fashion blogs,

399
00:43:01,718 --> 00:43:03,803
you officially look cool.

400
00:43:04,718 --> 00:43:06,553
Are we going to perform funny movements?

401
00:44:00,308 --> 00:44:02,474
What is he drawing?

402
00:45:05,149 --> 00:45:06,232
Is that you ?

403
00:45:06,899 --> 00:45:07,816
Hi.

404
00:45:10,691 --> 00:45:11,649
Hello.

405
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:22,526
Hello.

406
00:45:24,443 --> 00:45:25,318
Ah yes...

407
00:45:26,235 --> 00:45:27,983
So you know the DJ?

408
00:45:29,234 --> 00:45:30,234
That's cool.

409
00:45:31,526 --> 00:45:34,360
If that's the case,
you must know everyone?

410
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:36,195
So what ?

411
00:45:39,776 --> 00:45:41,360
Maybe you know whose tag this is?

412
00:45:44,276 --> 00:45:45,235
Here,

413
00:45:45,402 --> 00:45:47,444
Is the loser in trouble?

414
00:45:48,944 --> 00:45:49,861
Where is he ?

415
00:45:53,071 --> 00:45:54,362
Give me your phone.

416
00:46:01,113 --> 00:46:02,572
I would love to see the massacre.

417
00:46:03,987 --> 00:46:05,655
Here is his name and address.

418
00:46:06,072 --> 00:46:08,238
Tell him Dan sent you.

419
00:46:11,031 --> 00:46:11,906
That works.

420
00:46:14,906 --> 00:46:17,072
That's it.
It's over for that loser.

421
00:46:21,073 --> 00:46:22,114
That's cool.

422
00:46:23,282 --> 00:46:24,532
Okay, then ...

423
00:46:28,657 --> 00:46:30,699
Okay, well ...

424
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:33,490
By the way...

425
00:46:35,157 --> 00:46:36,157
Are you the one...

426
00:46:37,158 --> 00:46:38,491
who drew that?

427
00:46:46,202 --> 00:46:47,744
Yes it was me.

428
00:46:49,535 --> 00:46:51,493
- That's wonderful.
- Oh, Wow !

429
00:46:52,952 --> 00:46:53,867
Bye

430
00:46:58,036 --> 00:47:00,619
So that's one of those famous "hugs!"

431
00:47:00,828 --> 00:47:03,204
They are known to be proof of affection.

432
00:47:03,412 --> 00:47:06,410
They are much better
than sniffing the hindquarters.

433
00:47:07,244 --> 00:47:08,869
Did you just make a joke?

434
00:47:09,078 --> 00:47:11,204
I don't know, was it any good?

435
00:47:16,163 --> 00:47:19,204
The nanorobot-dog is learning
to take care of others.

436
00:47:29,956 --> 00:47:32,997
My mom doesn't want me to
have a dog,

437
00:47:33,207 --> 00:47:34,707
then go...

438
00:47:35,748 --> 00:47:37,416
Switch to "invisible" mode.

439
00:48:06,085 --> 00:48:07,043
And now ?

440
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:10,085
I think we should
tell him the news.

441
00:48:11,085 --> 00:48:12,459
Do it yourself.

442
00:48:13,668 --> 00:48:15,835
It's because of your work
that we have to move.

443
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:17,669
Max has no friends here
anyway.

444
00:48:17,877 --> 00:48:19,294
A new school ...

445
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,711
Calm down.

446
00:48:20,919 --> 00:48:22,628
Obviously,
it's easy for you!

447
00:48:22,795 --> 00:48:24,087
"No friends?"

448
00:48:24,295 --> 00:48:26,753
You didn't even
ask me for my opinion.

449
00:48:26,962 --> 00:48:29,796
What am I, too much baggage?
A stain on on your pants?

450
00:48:30,004 --> 00:48:30,921
Don't be cheeky.

451
00:48:31,088 --> 00:48:34,087
You don't care about me.
Either of you.

452
00:48:34,254 --> 00:48:35,546
- Hold on.
- Go!

453
00:48:35,754 --> 00:48:37,004
I will be better off without you.

454
00:48:39,504 --> 00:48:40,464
Max.

455
00:48:41,047 --> 00:48:42,131
Max !

456
00:49:27,927 --> 00:49:28,885
No!

457
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:30,302
Pavlo !

458
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:36,052
Call an ambulance !
Please!

459
00:49:45,887 --> 00:49:47,678
He could have saved him.

460
00:49:50,054 --> 00:49:51,719
Why didn't he do it?

461
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:15,973
Boss.

462
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:20,516
What do you want ?
Answer when I call you.

463
00:50:29,016 --> 00:50:30,183
What is that ?

464
00:50:30,682 --> 00:50:32,100
A handful of nanobots.

465
00:50:33,101 --> 00:50:35,684
Long story, short,
nanobots

466
00:50:35,851 --> 00:50:38,892
took the form
of some kind of super dog.

467
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:41,975
And then it vanished.

468
00:50:42,183 --> 00:50:44,392
And that's all that was left.

469
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:49,643
It stinks.

470
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:52,019
What do we do with it?

471
00:50:52,644 --> 00:50:55,811
Let's ask our scientists
to analyze them.

472
00:50:56,979 --> 00:50:57,894
Yes...

473
00:50:59,228 --> 00:51:00,562
I have an idea.

474
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:03,520
Have them analyzed.

475
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,937
We will reproduce them en masse.

476
00:51:06,604 --> 00:51:08,145
Tons at a time.

477
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,896
Excellent plan.

478
00:51:11,063 --> 00:51:11,938
Yes.

479
00:51:12,897 --> 00:51:14,353
It's a great plan.

480
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,355
Napoleon!

481
00:51:19,146 --> 00:51:21,814
The test results
are correct.

482
00:51:22,689 --> 00:51:25,397
He can come return in two days.

483
00:51:30,439 --> 00:51:32,564
What do you mean, "evaporated?"

484
00:51:32,731 --> 00:51:34,897
When did you last sleep?

485
00:51:35,106 --> 00:51:36,272
It doesn't matter.

486
00:51:36,481 --> 00:51:38,940
The nanobots have learned
to control their environment.

487
00:51:39,148 --> 00:51:42,233
Impressive, but
Gearz Robotics management is growing concerned.

488
00:51:42,441 --> 00:51:43,567
Are you covering for me?

489
00:51:43,775 --> 00:51:45,191
As long as I can.

490
00:51:56,192 --> 00:51:57,401
How is dad

491
00:51:58,526 --> 00:51:59,985
He had surgery.

492
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:02,319
Doctors say
he will pull through.

493
00:52:18,819 --> 00:52:20,070
Excess adrenaline

494
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:23,778
and bile is indicative
of great emotional stress.

495
00:52:23,986 --> 00:52:26,779
- Why didn't you help him?
- Help him?

496
00:52:26,988 --> 00:52:27,945
I saw everything.

497
00:52:28,113 --> 00:52:30,654
You were running fast, you could have
pushed him off the road.

498
00:52:30,821 --> 00:52:32,404
But you wanted to run away!

499
00:52:32,613 --> 00:52:35,239
I only helped you, Max.

500
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:36,365
Help me ?

501
00:52:36,573 --> 00:52:38,280
My father is in the hospital.

502
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,530
I thought you were my friend
but you...

503
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:42,446
Do you know what you are?

504
00:52:43,197 --> 00:52:44,072
Max...

505
00:52:53,282 --> 00:52:54,322
Well...

506
00:52:55,615 --> 00:52:56,948
I do not understand.

507
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,699
What do
you mean you can't reproduce them?

508
00:53:01,908 --> 00:53:05,824
It is almost impossible
to reverse-engineer nanotechnology.

509
00:53:11,157 --> 00:53:13,283
And it's also almost impossible
to survive my fist,

510
00:53:13,492 --> 00:53:15,283
but you can try.

511
00:53:16,618 --> 00:53:19,201
- How long will it take?
- A year or more.

512
00:53:19,409 --> 00:53:20,368
A year?

513
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:26,203
- Where is the boy ?
- What boy ?

514
00:53:27,327 --> 00:53:29,952
You told me about a kid.
Go and get him.

515
00:53:31,577 --> 00:53:33,245
He is just a child.

516
00:53:33,453 --> 00:53:35,035
You work for me.

517
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:38,121
You do not have a choice.
Your father owes me a debt.

518
00:53:38,286 --> 00:53:39,621
You owe me.

519
00:53:40,662 --> 00:53:42,704
The kid doesn't know anything.

520
00:53:44,495 --> 00:53:46,370
He made a dog
out of nanobots.

521
00:53:46,578 --> 00:53:47,661
Go and get him.

522
00:53:47,828 --> 00:53:49,537
You understood ? Do it.

523
00:53:49,704 --> 00:53:50,579
Go on!

524
00:54:00,621 --> 00:54:01,580
Follow him.

525
00:54:03,955 --> 00:54:05,330
Madame Skoryk?

526
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:16,875
Hi, son.

527
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:18,124
Come closer.

528
00:54:23,083 --> 00:54:25,750
You look even worse
than me!

529
00:54:27,834 --> 00:54:28,958
It's my fault.

530
00:54:30,752 --> 00:54:31,627
Max...

531
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:34,583
I'm
just a freak of nature,

532
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,334
a design flaw.

533
00:54:38,417 --> 00:54:41,542
If you want to move,
then let's move.

534
00:54:42,252 --> 00:54:45,043
I do not care.
I will draw new friends.

535
00:54:47,043 --> 00:54:49,209
You were right,
we should have consulted you.

536
00:54:49,417 --> 00:54:51,710
We won't leave
if you don't want to.

537
00:54:51,877 --> 00:54:54,252
Everybody makes mistakes.

538
00:54:54,419 --> 00:54:55,628
Honey...

539
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:18,422
Max !

540
00:55:20,881 --> 00:55:23,338
You know, Foxter,
everyone makes mistakes.

541
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:25,838
It is true.

542
00:55:27,506 --> 00:55:29,340
I'll try to explain it to you.

543
00:55:29,548 --> 00:55:32,090
I know you were trying
to help me run away.

544
00:55:32,258 --> 00:55:33,133
Okay.

545
00:55:33,673 --> 00:55:36,923
I was running away because I thought
Dad wanted to get under my skin.

546
00:55:37,132 --> 00:55:38,173
Is that so ?

547
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:41,090
What did he want to do
with your skin?

548
00:55:42,091 --> 00:55:43,174
Nothing,

549
00:55:43,341 --> 00:55:45,424
it's just an expression.

550
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:46,508
Okay.

551
00:55:46,967 --> 00:55:49,425
I ran away,
but I didn't really want to.

552
00:55:50,217 --> 00:55:53,135
Ah!
I don't understand, explain it to me.

553
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:57,635
Sometimes humans do things
they don't want to do.

554
00:55:57,843 --> 00:55:58,886
But why ?

555
00:55:59,094 --> 00:56:00,134
Well,

556
00:56:00,342 --> 00:56:02,385
imagine you like a girl

557
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:04,886
and then you pretend
to ignore her.

558
00:56:05,927 --> 00:56:06,969
Why ?

559
00:56:07,178 --> 00:56:09,219
To get her attention.

560
00:56:09,387 --> 00:56:12,218
Humans are
strange creatures without logic.

561
00:56:12,426 --> 00:56:14,969
But hey,
I was created to obey you.

562
00:56:15,136 --> 00:56:16,177
No.

563
00:56:16,345 --> 00:56:18,762
You should make
your own decisions.

564
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:21,512
When a car is about to
hit a human,

565
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:24,928
we don't care
what i want.

566
00:56:25,137 --> 00:56:26,928
I should have saved the human?

567
00:56:27,137 --> 00:56:28,429
Obviously!

568
00:56:28,595 --> 00:56:31,637
Human life
is much more important

569
00:56:31,803 --> 00:56:33,054
than my little moods.

570
00:56:33,971 --> 00:56:34,929
I see.

571
00:56:35,139 --> 00:56:37,389
We don't care,
I have to make decisions,

572
00:56:37,597 --> 00:56:39,430
life is more important
than states of mind.

573
00:56:39,848 --> 00:56:41,890
- That's it ?
- Pretty much.

574
00:56:42,056 --> 00:56:43,223
You're cool.

575
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:45,556
- You too.
- High five !

576
00:56:53,348 --> 00:56:54,807
Max, look!

577
00:57:00,933 --> 00:57:03,140
Sonia?
What are you doing here ?

578
00:57:03,766 --> 00:57:06,349
I heard about your father,
I decided to come.

579
00:57:06,516 --> 00:57:07,391
Honestly...

580
00:57:09,017 --> 00:57:10,893
I'm very happy to see you.

581
00:57:13,684 --> 00:57:14,726
You came...

582
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:17,101
without Dan?

583
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:18,683
Well...

584
00:57:18,892 --> 00:57:21,267
He invented the story
that I was his girlfriend,

585
00:57:21,475 --> 00:57:24,102
but
I think he's a moron.

586
00:57:43,437 --> 00:57:45,563
You are not allowed
to park here.

587
00:57:47,355 --> 00:57:50,689
So move it ...
You little smart-ass.

588
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,773
Can you imagine yourself in this car?

589
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:21,108
Can you imagine us,

590
00:58:21,316 --> 00:58:24,358
both
on an endless highway ...

591
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,026
extending to the horizon?

592
00:58:27,526 --> 00:58:29,484
- Max ...
- That would be great.

593
00:58:29,901 --> 00:58:31,817
Tell her that you can drive.

594
00:58:31,984 --> 00:58:34,192
- Leave me !
- What?

595
00:58:35,485 --> 00:58:37,986
Sit behind the wheel,
I'll drive.

596
00:58:38,194 --> 00:58:39,861
She will be impressed!

597
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:43,735
You know, I can drive.

598
00:58:43,943 --> 00:58:45,027
It is true ?

599
00:58:45,235 --> 00:58:46,318
You're crazy ?

600
00:58:47,193 --> 00:58:50,194
After all, he asked me
to move his car!

601
00:59:02,737 --> 00:59:05,070
Try to look natural.

602
00:59:06,571 --> 00:59:08,321
How are you going to start it?

603
00:59:08,488 --> 00:59:09,821
Put your hands on the wheel,

604
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:11,989
tell her
you have magic fingers

605
00:59:12,197 --> 00:59:14,321
and press the button.

606
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:17,823
Well ...
I have magic fingers.

607
00:59:19,114 --> 00:59:20,071
Let's go.

608
00:59:24,657 --> 00:59:25,990
And now ?

609
00:59:26,573 --> 00:59:29,741
This toy will show us
what it is capable of.

610
00:59:35,908 --> 00:59:37,366
And who are you?

611
00:59:42,117 --> 00:59:44,033
This beauty has horse-power!

612
00:59:50,784 --> 00:59:51,992
Take that !

613
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,826
That was Dan!
Did you see that ?

614
01:00:09,452 --> 01:00:11,202
When did you learn to drive?

615
01:00:11,619 --> 01:00:13,662
And like that ?
This is crazy.

616
01:00:14,537 --> 01:00:17,496
It's ... not that difficult!

617
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:25,037
I didn't
think you were that cool.

618
01:00:26,288 --> 01:00:29,079
Dating site tip: give
her a compliment.

619
01:00:29,913 --> 01:00:30,788
Thank you.

620
01:00:30,955 --> 01:00:31,997
You are cool too.

621
01:00:32,704 --> 01:00:34,705
Really cool, chick!

622
01:00:38,914 --> 01:00:41,372
Great advice ... thank you!

623
01:00:50,249 --> 01:00:52,000
I am beginning to get tired of you ...

624
01:01:15,083 --> 01:01:16,751
VOICE COMMAND

625
01:01:16,918 --> 01:01:19,334
4x4 black: 0808-AI.

626
01:01:20,419 --> 01:01:23,544
Owner of the vehicle
sought by Interpol.

627
01:01:33,086 --> 01:01:36,462
There are people behind us.
We should let them pass.

628
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:56,674
Are you ok?

629
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:58,840
What came over you?

630
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:00,547
We almost died.

631
01:02:00,714 --> 01:02:03,089
I told you not to
take my orders literally!

632
01:02:03,298 --> 01:02:05,298
How can you be so stupid?

633
01:02:11,465 --> 01:02:12,340
Sonia.

634
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:15,090
It's not what you think.

635
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:18,757
You didn't just yell
at your imaginary friend?

636
01:02:18,965 --> 01:02:21,216
No ! I yelled at my dog.

637
01:02:21,716 --> 01:02:23,008
Actually, he is not really a dog.

638
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:25,551
He's a top-secret super robot.

639
01:02:29,384 --> 01:02:32,509
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
OUT OF SERVICE SYSTEM RESTART

640
01:02:32,677 --> 01:02:34,010
Are you ok?

641
01:02:34,843 --> 01:02:36,053
No, I'm fine.

642
01:02:36,801 --> 01:02:38,218
I'm from the police.

643
01:02:38,927 --> 01:02:40,843
I would like to see your license,

644
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,761
but I suspect
you don't have one.

645
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,012
This car is not yours,
is it?

646
01:02:48,345 --> 01:02:50,761
My friend asked me
to move it for him.

647
01:02:52,845 --> 01:02:55,594
I know you have something else
that doesn't belong to you.

648
01:02:56,179 --> 01:02:58,345
I'm not sure I understand.

649
01:02:59,263 --> 01:03:00,262
You know what ?

650
01:03:00,971 --> 01:03:04,138
You will accompany me to the station
and everything will become clearer.

651
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:06,263
We prefer to walk, thank you.

652
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,097
Do I have to drag you there by force?

653
01:03:21,016 --> 01:03:22,765
That isn't a police car.

654
01:03:22,973 --> 01:03:24,057
Keep moving.

655
01:03:36,975 --> 01:03:39,141
Emergency mode ...

656
01:03:39,808 --> 01:03:40,683
Mode...

657
01:03:40,808 --> 01:03:42,224
Do not worry.

658
01:03:42,433 --> 01:03:43,559
I am a friend.

659
01:03:44,184 --> 01:03:46,560
I didn't
mean to cause an accident.

660
01:03:46,768 --> 01:03:49,560
I was trying to slow down
those chasing you.

661
01:03:51,142 --> 01:03:52,017
Who are you ?

662
01:03:52,184 --> 01:03:55,600
Let's say it was I
who gave birth to you.

663
01:03:55,809 --> 01:03:57,060
You can trust me.

664
01:03:57,685 --> 01:04:00,186
He took Max and Sonia.

665
01:04:01,019 --> 01:04:02,852
I was unable to help them.

666
01:04:03,019 --> 01:04:05,144
My nanoconnections
are very weak.

667
01:04:05,352 --> 01:04:07,853
You have to help me
find the kids.

668
01:04:08,062 --> 01:04:08,938
Sorry,

669
01:04:09,062 --> 01:04:11,395
my program
tracks nanobots.

670
01:04:12,187 --> 01:04:14,187
It is unable
to locate people.

671
01:04:14,353 --> 01:04:16,770
Max wears an earpiece.

672
01:04:16,979 --> 01:04:19,895
I made it
from nanobots.

673
01:04:24,564 --> 01:04:25,855
Where is the dog ?

674
01:04:26,272 --> 01:04:27,564
Let Sonia go.

675
01:04:28,396 --> 01:04:31,230
No no no...

676
01:04:31,438 --> 01:04:33,855
What would you want
with such a flea bag?

677
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:36,939
It doesn't concern you.

678
01:04:38,856 --> 01:04:40,607
He stayed at the hospital.

679
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:48,690
I personally intend
to snatch him ...

680
01:04:49,731 --> 01:04:50,815
Paws,

681
01:04:51,274 --> 01:04:52,399
tail

682
01:04:52,607 --> 01:04:53,732
and ears.

683
01:04:57,317 --> 01:04:58,818
I will rip it ...

684
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:01,608
to pieces !

685
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:05,401
You will no longer recognize him.

686
01:05:08,233 --> 01:05:11,985
Then I will use nanobots
to conquer the world.

687
01:05:13,444 --> 01:05:14,735
Like Napoleon.

688
01:05:22,777 --> 01:05:24,986
If the dog is not at the hospital

689
01:05:25,153 --> 01:05:26,486
as you said...

690
01:05:26,695 --> 01:05:28,529
Let us just say that it is of 
interest to you that I find it.

691
01:05:29,362 --> 01:05:31,111
What are you hiding from me there?

692
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,486
Give me that.

693
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:33,778
Right now.

694
01:05:45,197 --> 01:05:47,364
Soon the city will be mine.

695
01:05:48,364 --> 01:05:53,573
I am on the verge
of realizing my childhood dream.

696
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:11,325
If the owner of this building
kidnapped them,

697
01:06:11,533 --> 01:06:14,450
Then our chances
are pretty slim.

698
01:06:15,283 --> 01:06:17,908
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Is your "invisible" mode still working?

699
01:06:18,075 --> 01:06:19,950
Yes, it works.

700
01:06:20,158 --> 01:06:22,991
But it has bugs because the
nanochannels are interrupted.

701
01:06:24,034 --> 01:06:25,201
It's incredible.

702
01:06:25,409 --> 01:06:26,659
I still can't get over it.

703
01:06:28,659 --> 01:06:31,492
The kids are inside,
we should call the police.

704
01:06:31,701 --> 01:06:33,827
We cannot intervene on our own.

705
01:06:34,410 --> 01:06:37,077
I'm going to record
everything you see.

706
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:38,829
I will send the pictures
to the police.

707
01:06:38,994 --> 01:06:41,453
You are a
very intelligent human specimen .

708
01:06:42,204 --> 01:06:43,119
Thank you.

709
01:06:43,869 --> 01:06:44,828
I lied.

710
01:06:45,577 --> 01:06:48,244
Foxter is in the car,
not in the hospital.

711
01:06:48,994 --> 01:06:53,454
Foxter,
is that the robot they talked about?

712
01:06:53,996 --> 01:06:55,788
He can make himself invisible.

713
01:06:56,371 --> 01:06:58,369
So it was him that you were yelling at.

714
01:06:59,079 --> 01:07:01,996
How is that possible ?
What is he exactly ?

715
01:07:02,412 --> 01:07:05,038
Some kind of nanorobot, I think.

716
01:07:05,247 --> 01:07:08,539
He can turn
into lots of different things.

717
01:07:08,706 --> 01:07:09,996
He's fantastic.

718
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:13,290
Can he drive a car?

719
01:07:15,121 --> 01:07:15,996
Yes.

720
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:19,248
He can drive. Not me.

721
01:07:19,414 --> 01:07:21,957
I'm not cool.
I am a loser.

722
01:07:22,165 --> 01:07:23,749
That's not true.

723
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:27,666
Nobody would have stood up
to this man like you did.

724
01:07:27,834 --> 01:07:30,167
You really have to be
very brave.

725
01:07:31,834 --> 01:07:32,709
Thank you.

726
01:07:36,458 --> 01:07:37,499
So brave guy,

727
01:07:39,084 --> 01:07:41,210
How are we going to get out of here?

728
01:08:32,423 --> 01:08:33,382
Hi guys.

729
01:08:33,591 --> 01:08:34,466
Have you seen Arcan?

730
01:08:34,674 --> 01:08:36,340
He went out.

731
01:08:57,799 --> 01:08:59,300
He's here, grab him!

732
01:09:05,385 --> 01:09:08,720
INVISIBLE MODE
SYSTEM ERROR

733
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:12,844
He's there !

734
01:09:16,219 --> 01:09:17,886
- What's the matter ?
- It's that thing!

735
01:09:18,095 --> 01:09:18,927
Get up !

736
01:09:33,596 --> 01:09:34,637
Move!

737
01:09:37,847 --> 01:09:38,929
Help me !

738
01:09:40,179 --> 01:09:42,055
You are useless !

739
01:09:54,889 --> 01:09:55,807
Catch it!

740
01:10:27,768 --> 01:10:29,310
It's over.

741
01:10:32,392 --> 01:10:33,935
Now let's have some fun.

742
01:10:46,645 --> 01:10:49,520
Why won't the robots
change shape

743
01:10:49,729 --> 01:10:51,188
without the kid's order?

744
01:10:51,896 --> 01:10:54,645
They use
their owner's code .

745
01:10:55,354 --> 01:10:56,938
If you want them to obey,

746
01:10:57,813 --> 01:10:59,605
you will need a good hacker

747
01:10:59,813 --> 01:11:03,982
and it will take time
to reformulate all the encoding.

748
01:11:05,107 --> 01:11:07,396
I see.
I have a hacker.

749
01:11:07,564 --> 01:11:08,897
You will do it.

750
01:11:10,856 --> 01:11:11,772
No.

751
01:11:15,898 --> 01:11:16,773
No?

752
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:19,982
I do not know this word.

753
01:11:20,983 --> 01:11:22,773
I can reformulate it for you:

754
01:11:23,398 --> 01:11:25,982
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I will never in my life do such a thing.

755
01:11:27,441 --> 01:11:29,316
I created these robots
for a good cause,

756
01:11:29,524 --> 01:11:31,025
not for you.

757
01:11:32,191 --> 01:11:33,067
Good...

758
01:11:35,109 --> 01:11:36,985
So in three seconds,

759
01:11:37,610 --> 01:11:41,443
the lady will discover
the joys of aerobatics.

760
01:11:47,318 --> 01:11:48,110
One!

761
01:11:53,862 --> 01:11:54,945
Two!

762
01:11:58,236 --> 01:11:59,652
- Three!
- Stop it!

763
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,445
Yes !

764
01:12:13,695 --> 01:12:16,988
We can't give Foxter to them.

765
01:12:17,196 --> 01:12:19,071
You can't imagine
what they want to do.

766
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:21,405
I have a plan,
but I need help.

767
01:12:25,365 --> 01:12:26,740
What is that ?

768
01:12:26,948 --> 01:12:27,948
No idea,

769
01:12:28,155 --> 01:12:31,281
but she neutralized
the car electronics.

770
01:12:31,491 --> 01:12:32,990
It could be useful.

771
01:12:34,031 --> 01:12:35,031
Good game plan.

772
01:12:45,324 --> 01:12:47,282
How should I encode
robots?

773
01:12:48,366 --> 01:12:49,741
What what do you want them to do?

774
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:57,367
I want them to turn
into an unstoppable computer virus,

775
01:12:57,533 --> 01:12:59,159
barrier-proof,

776
01:12:59,325 --> 01:13:01,450
to steal cryptocurrency

777
01:13:01,617 --> 01:13:03,575
and to have them obey my orders.

778
01:13:03,742 --> 01:13:06,160
Once I have
all the money I want,

779
01:13:06,369 --> 01:13:08,160
I can go anywhere.

780
01:13:08,369 --> 01:13:09,952
I will be the master of this city.

781
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:12,161
I will control all the computers.

782
01:13:12,328 --> 01:13:16,036
Everyone will obey me
and be afraid of me.

783
01:13:16,246 --> 01:13:20,120
Nanobots will be
my secret weapon.

784
01:13:20,328 --> 01:13:22,245
At this moment,

785
01:13:22,453 --> 01:13:24,661
no one will dare
to disrespect me.

786
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:25,911
I get it.

787
01:13:26,079 --> 01:13:28,121
The cylinder must first be removed.

788
01:13:29,954 --> 01:13:31,872
Glass blocks the signal.

789
01:13:33,497 --> 01:13:35,329
Okay, but don't try anything.

790
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:37,662
Or I'll reduce you to molecules.

791
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:39,205
Remove the cylinder.

792
01:13:50,997 --> 01:13:52,122
First I must turn off the system ...

793
01:13:52,706 --> 01:13:54,623
Something has to be done.

794
01:13:54,831 --> 01:13:58,081
We are not programmed
to oppose humans.

795
01:14:05,667 --> 01:14:06,459
ACCESS DENIED

796
01:14:07,084 --> 01:14:08,376
Why is it taking so long?

797
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:10,501
Reprogram this pooch for me!

798
01:14:42,919 --> 01:14:43,794
Max...

799
01:14:45,294 --> 01:14:46,337
Come here.

800
01:14:49,755 --> 01:14:52,006
Do you remember when you said

801
01:14:52,214 --> 01:14:54,631
that I had to make
my own decisions?

802
01:14:55,214 --> 01:15:00,547
I don't want to become a
weapon in the service of this psychopath.

803
01:15:01,671 --> 01:15:03,421
I made a decision,

804
01:15:03,631 --> 01:15:05,756
but I need your help.

805
01:15:06,965 --> 01:15:07,922
Max,

806
01:15:08,048 --> 01:15:11,466
you have to order me
to disintegrate.

807
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:13,923
To disintegrate?

808
01:15:16,631 --> 01:15:18,673
I can't do that.

809
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:23,008
Afterwards, you will no longer be my Foxter.

810
01:15:23,174 --> 01:15:25,300
I will always be with you.

811
01:15:26,216 --> 01:15:28,133
It was you who created me.

812
01:15:29,592 --> 01:15:30,799
Be strong.

813
01:15:31,883 --> 01:15:33,759
We will always be together.

814
01:15:34,758 --> 01:15:35,884
I promise you.

815
01:15:37,092 --> 01:15:38,510
I will have you all!

816
01:15:45,011 --> 01:15:46,387
I am sorry...

817
01:15:48,802 --> 01:15:50,137
Disintegrate.

818
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:07,428
Go get the car.

819
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:10,929
The cops know
you kidnapped the kids.

820
01:16:11,138 --> 01:16:12,013
And...

821
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:15,888
I sent a video to the media
showing them the scumbag that you are.

822
01:16:16,347 --> 01:16:17,264
You're screwed.

823
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:24,389
Find a landline phone.

824
01:16:24,597 --> 01:16:26,722
Call my helicopter!

825
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:46,725
Max, remember:

826
01:16:46,933 --> 01:16:48,183
I am you

827
01:16:48,808 --> 01:16:50,309
and you are me ...

828
01:17:03,143 --> 01:17:04,185
Are you stupid ?

829
01:17:04,352 --> 01:17:06,894
You are nothing without your little dog!

830
01:17:07,727 --> 01:17:09,060
Let her go!

831
01:17:24,688 --> 01:17:26,605
I would play all day with you,

832
01:17:26,771 --> 01:17:27,730
but I have to go.

833
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:31,437
Come on!

834
01:17:48,315 --> 01:17:49,857
Get over here!

835
01:17:50,024 --> 01:17:51,524
Come on!

836
01:17:52,482 --> 01:17:54,316
It's time to leave!

837
01:17:55,523 --> 01:17:58,065
Throw me the ladder!

838
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:00,856
Max !

839
01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:08,733
Let her go!

840
01:18:09,484 --> 01:18:10,401
You want her?

841
01:18:10,609 --> 01:18:12,235
No problem !

842
01:18:27,403 --> 01:18:28,570
You go, Max.

843
01:18:29,361 --> 01:18:31,279
You are the hero of your universe.

844
01:18:31,862 --> 01:18:33,152
Remember :

845
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,153
I will always be with you.

846
01:18:38,694 --> 01:18:40,237
WIND -
WEIGHT SIZE - DISTANCE

847
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,487
CHUTE

848
01:18:56,114 --> 01:18:57,030
I will break you.

849
01:19:00,281 --> 01:19:01,365
We will see.

850
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:14,991
Sonia !

851
01:19:45,826 --> 01:19:47,952
Can you teach her to fly?

852
01:20:02,288 --> 01:20:03,413
Look out !

853
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:15,628
My hero...

854
01:21:35,548 --> 01:21:37,256
Let's go home, my little ones.

855
01:22:00,758 --> 01:22:02,426
I'm sorry about your dog.

856
01:22:03,009 --> 01:22:04,550
He was cool.

857
01:22:05,216 --> 01:22:07,800
He was a true friend.

858
01:22:08,425 --> 01:22:10,008
Yes, he truly was.

859
01:22:14,968 --> 01:22:16,135
Momma !

860
01:22:26,928 --> 01:22:27,804
Max !

861
01:22:28,219 --> 01:22:30,511
Max! You are alive !

862
01:22:32,386 --> 01:22:33,470
How are you ?

863
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:35,887
You gave us quite a scare!

864
01:22:36,095 --> 01:22:38,554
Come on, we're going home.

865
01:22:45,095 --> 01:22:45,970
Hi.

866
01:22:47,471 --> 01:22:48,389
Hello.

867
01:22:49,846 --> 01:22:52,306
You know,
Gearz Robotics has a bright future.

868
01:22:54,597 --> 01:22:56,889
I really need
a professional

869
01:22:57,097 --> 01:22:59,514
to strengthen
our security system.

870
01:23:02,139 --> 01:23:03,307
Are you interested ?

871
01:23:14,849 --> 01:23:17,392
- Max, can you get the door?
- Hush ...

872
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:27,685
I have a letter for Max Skoryk.

873
01:23:28,768 --> 01:23:29,643
Here.

874
01:23:40,269 --> 01:23:41,519
It's the contest.

875
01:23:42,312 --> 01:23:44,186
I won the drawing contest!

876
01:23:45,394 --> 01:23:48,936
And a year of training
with a real artist!

877
01:23:49,602 --> 01:23:50,644
That's great.

878
01:23:50,852 --> 01:23:52,644
I didn't know
you entered.

879
01:23:52,812 --> 01:23:53,812
Neither did I.

880
01:23:53,978 --> 01:23:54,770
Congratulations!

881
01:23:54,937 --> 01:23:57,521
Take it, this is for you.

882
01:23:59,522 --> 01:24:00,772
Just for you.

883
01:24:12,897 --> 01:24:14,731
Hi, little fellow!

884
01:24:14,940 --> 01:24:16,148
What are you doing here ?

885
01:24:17,023 --> 01:24:18,606
What are you going to call him?

886
01:24:19,481 --> 01:24:20,354
Me ?

887
01:24:20,522 --> 01:24:23,356
If you can bring down
the city's worst criminal,

888
01:24:23,565 --> 01:24:26,774
I think that you are responsible 
enough to have a dog.

889
01:24:26,982 --> 01:24:28,732
So what is his name going to be?

890
01:24:29,482 --> 01:24:30,441
Foxter.

891
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:32,774
His name is Foxter.

892
01:24:33,941 --> 01:24:35,024
I'm good with Foxter.

893
01:24:35,232 --> 01:24:36,357
It's okay with me.

894
01:24:43,108 --> 01:24:44,192
Come on, Foxter,

895
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,526
We will make you
a real dog!

896
01:28:52,375 --> 01:28:54,500
