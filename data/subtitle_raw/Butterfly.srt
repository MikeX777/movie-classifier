1
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:51,605
Good Springs?

2
00:01:52,574 --> 00:01:54,847
I'm just going as far as Searchlight.

3
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:58,077
What's anybody
wanna go to Good Springs for anyway?

4
00:01:58,363 --> 00:02:02,255
That town has been near deserted ever since
the mine closed and the Gillespies moved

5
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,904
their silver operation over to
Kingman Arizona.

6
00:02:14,289 --> 00:02:16,432
Searchlight is where I turn off.

7
00:02:44,452 --> 00:02:48,589
Thank heaven I come along when I did.
It'll be dark before long.

8
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:56,877
Rattlers come out to the road
for warmth then.

9
00:02:57,752 --> 00:03:00,888
A person don't stand a chance
way out here with them buggers.

10
00:03:02,585 --> 00:03:06,085
People have been known to just
disappear out here in this desert.

11
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:10,832
One minute they're there,
and then poof, they're gone.

12
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:14,247
I'm ahead of schedule today.

13
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:19,482
Maybe we could... stop and...
stretch somewhere.

14
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:25,509
I guess Good Springs ain't too
far out of my way.

15
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:28,968
Thank God I came along wihen I did.

16
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:36,747
<i>Town's just up ahead.</i>

17
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:42,138
<i>This looks like a nice quiet spot.</i>

18
00:04:07,752 --> 00:04:10,341
Hey! Hey! God dammit!

19
00:04:10,394 --> 00:04:12,082
Where do you think you're going?

20
00:04:12,114 --> 00:04:14,114
Damn you!

21
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:18,553
Damn you! Those rattlers are
gonna eat you alive!

22
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:22,495
I hope they get you and you burn
in hell, you little harlett!

23
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:27,718
Ow... ow... Jeez.

24
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:15,390
- Miss.
- Hello.

25
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,332
Something you want?

26
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:20,479
How can I tell until
I know what you got?

27
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:27,099
Maybe you're making a mistake.

28
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,799
Maybe you're looking for
somebody else's place.

29
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:41,686
Not mine.

30
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:45,496
<i>I'm looking for you.</i>

31
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,800
How do you know?

32
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:50,239
You ain't seen me before.

33
00:06:50,969 --> 00:06:53,016
You're Jess Tyler.

34
00:06:57,961 --> 00:06:59,110
Who are you?

35
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:02,514
Just somebody you might like to know.

36
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:08,233
I don't like people making fun.

37
00:07:11,678 --> 00:07:13,407
Maybe I'm not.

38
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,703
That ain't gonna be cold.

39
00:07:41,764 --> 00:07:43,304
I like it warm.

40
00:07:44,152 --> 00:07:45,581
With foam on it.

41
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:56,857
You're a Morgan, ain't you?

42
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,841
What makes you think that?

43
00:07:59,357 --> 00:08:01,423
You can tell a Morgan anywhere.

44
00:08:03,297 --> 00:08:05,049
If you know what to look for.

45
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:08,554
I bet I know what you was
looking for when you was 19.

46
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:10,529
Bell Morgan was 14.

47
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:14,257
You musta liked it. You married her.

48
00:08:15,048 --> 00:08:16,210
Maybe.

49
00:08:17,974 --> 00:08:19,692
You didn't like Bell?

50
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,230
Once.

51
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:28,688
You musta liked her more than
once. You had two kids.

52
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,237
I don't talk about it.

53
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:36,389
Did other men have something to
do with it?

54
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,134
Maybe.

55
00:08:41,748 --> 00:08:43,916
A man named Moke Blue.

56
00:08:44,753 --> 00:08:46,821
So you put her out.

57
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:48,392
No.

58
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:51,195
She left.

59
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:54,627
With him.

60
00:09:03,516 --> 00:09:06,780
Well, maybe she didn't want to
be stuck out here alone.

61
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:09,637
Maybe she liked people.

62
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:12,103
Yeah.

63
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:15,429
Maybe she liked a lot of things.

64
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:18,990
Do you ever think about her?

65
00:09:19,563 --> 00:09:20,823
Uh-uh.

66
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,208
Or the children?

67
00:09:28,376 --> 00:09:29,376
Sometimes.

68
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:30,445
You ever want to see them?

69
00:09:32,592 --> 00:09:34,546
They left when the mine closed.

70
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,063
Ten years ago.

71
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:42,214
When it was operating, I was in
charge of the small chunks of ore.

72
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:47,070
You know, the kind that somebody can just reach down,
pick up and stick in their pocket and run off with.

73
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,789
Well, I never did.

74
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,021
Not even a few nuggets?

75
00:09:51,046 --> 00:09:53,565
Just for yourself or Bell?

76
00:09:57,438 --> 00:09:58,499
No.

77
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:02,896
That's why they give me the job
of guarding it now.

78
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,753
Keeping it away from scavengers.

79
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:07,751
Well, maybe you shoulda taken some.

80
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,996
- Things may have been different for you and her.
- I doubt it.

81
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:15,886
That's what I heard.

82
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:20,597
- Who from?
- Don't you know?

83
00:10:20,907 --> 00:10:21,907
No!

84
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:28,241
Look who's raring up.

85
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,840
Hey,

86
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,660
don't it get lonely out here?

87
00:10:45,398 --> 00:10:47,747
Or is just milking that
cow good enough for you?

88
00:10:49,307 --> 00:10:51,550
You keep talking like that

89
00:10:51,575 --> 00:10:53,280
something might just happen to you.

90
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:55,746
Not unless I want it to.

91
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:02,543
If you were a Morgan, you'd want it to.

92
00:11:03,091 --> 00:11:06,483
That's good because I am a Morgan.

93
00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:10,019
I'm your daughter, Kady.

94
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:28,671
Hard to say something Jess? You didn't
think I'd still be a little girl, did yah?

95
00:11:28,786 --> 00:11:33,257
No. I didn't think you'd be so
grown up either.

96
00:11:33,514 --> 00:11:37,917
Had to grow up around Bell and that boarding
house she runs for Gillespie miners.

97
00:11:38,504 --> 00:11:40,747
I was ten when I found out that
she was selling more

98
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:43,225
to the boarders than just
meals and clean sheets.

99
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:45,703
Jane too, I suppose.

100
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:48,682
Yeah, it wasn't all bad.

101
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:52,700
The miners was nice to us.
We reminded them of their own kids.

102
00:11:52,725 --> 00:11:55,323
We called they Daddy Bob, Dadddy George.

103
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:58,481
It made them feel good, I guess.
Not so lonely.

104
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,488
Jane... used to favor me.

105
00:12:04,336 --> 00:12:05,876
Does she still?

106
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,943
She took over running the place when Bell got
sick but, she wanted to go out and finish school.

107
00:12:11,284 --> 00:12:12,718
Bell's sickness...

108
00:12:13,924 --> 00:12:16,044
all come out of a bottle.

109
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:19,848
It's pretty bad lung trouble.
The Doctor said she ain't got long.

110
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,265
We tried to get Moke Blue to help out

111
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:26,401
and that's like trying to get
water to run uphill.

112
00:12:28,466 --> 00:12:29,693
You finish school?

113
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:35,452
No.

114
00:12:36,211 --> 00:12:39,615
- Why is that?
- Is it ever?

115
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:40,936
A man?

116
00:12:43,526 --> 00:12:45,553
I got pregnant...

117
00:12:46,937 --> 00:12:49,057
and quit school when I started swelling.

118
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,276
The baby was born about a month ago.

119
00:12:57,204 --> 00:12:58,466
His daddy had even see it.

120
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:04,056
- Well, I...
- Don't say you're sorry Jess. That's what he said.

121
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:07,818
I couldn't take it anymore.

122
00:13:07,893 --> 00:13:10,065
Listening to the laughs and whispers.

123
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:12,955
Walk down the street
with my stomach out and

124
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:15,999
I hear people say that's
Bell's daughter alright. That's

125
00:13:16,256 --> 00:13:19,024
one kid that listened good to
her parent.

126
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:21,914
Jane is taking care of the baby.

127
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:25,564
She really is.

128
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,091
But I had to get away.

129
00:13:30,865 --> 00:13:32,327
You don't have to do that.

130
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,818
Oh, I don't mind. I want to.
I like doing things for a man.

131
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:41,568
- You will make somebody a good wife.
- Maybe...

132
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:46,420
but I ain't wanting to get married, righ now.
- What are yo planning on doing?

133
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:51,401
Keep you from being lonely.

134
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,825
I come to stay with you.

135
00:14:01,568 --> 00:14:03,164
You can't do that Kady.

136
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:08,108
Sorry, you just can't.

137
00:14:09,537 --> 00:14:11,077
Don't make me go.

138
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:15,597
Look, get your stuff together

139
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:19,925
and, I'll run you wherever you
want to go, but

140
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,669
you just can't stay here.

141
00:14:23,992 --> 00:14:24,992
Please.

142
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:28,576
Jess!

143
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:32,595
I'm your daughter and I got

144
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,834
no place to go.

145
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:36,372
Goodnight.

146
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:40,870
Goodnight.

147
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,572
Jess.

148
00:16:46,934 --> 00:16:47,978
Yeah.

149
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,475
Thank you.

150
00:16:55,121 --> 00:16:56,182
You're welcome.

151
00:17:00,992 --> 00:17:02,689
Goodnight.

152
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,177
Kady.

153
00:17:45,202 --> 00:17:47,208
It's Sunday. I got to go to church.

154
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:51,907
Kady!

155
00:17:57,172 --> 00:17:58,648
Kady!

156
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:03,603
Kady!

157
00:18:07,563 --> 00:18:11,126
Kady? Whatcha doing up there?

158
00:18:11,534 --> 00:18:14,842
- Just looking.
- Well, there ain't much to look at.

159
00:18:15,481 --> 00:18:19,217
You ever go in Jess?
Yeah, once in a while.

160
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:21,572
Make sure there no scavengers
been in there.

161
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:25,300
How much silver is in there Jess?

162
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:30,478
Oh, there's a good bit of little stuff.
Chippings mostly.

163
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,097
But...

164
00:18:32,162 --> 00:18:36,198
not enough for Mr. Gillespie to
keep a full crew on.

165
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,836
Keep both me and the mill
working at the same time.

166
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:42,833
Is that why they closed it down?

167
00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:45,389
Yeah.

168
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:48,458
Maybe they didn't
stick with it long enough.

169
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:50,601
Maybe it's still there.

170
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:52,666
Maybe.

171
00:18:53,504 --> 00:18:57,874
You know Mr. Gillespie is a pretty smart
business man. He knows what he's doing.

172
00:18:58,221 --> 00:18:59,221
Yeah.

173
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:03,079
It's getting late
and I gotta go to church.

174
00:19:03,474 --> 00:19:06,572
Wanna come?
- Is there enough silver in there to make

175
00:19:06,597 --> 00:19:09,329
one, maybe two people rich?

176
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,066
Yeah.

177
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,675
If they could get to it.

178
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:19,408
What's to stop them?
- Me. Now, let's go.

179
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:23,391
No! You're the guard here Jess.
What's to stop

180
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,065
us from getting it out?

181
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:27,264
Ourselves. Come on.

182
00:19:27,405 --> 00:19:31,542
Is all you want from life is that
miserable shack and a lonely closed down

183
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,391
mine to live with?

184
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,833
Kady, we all come to be what
God put us on this earth to be.

185
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:42,521
Now, Mr. Gillespie was made to own
this mine and I was made to guard it.

186
00:19:42,978 --> 00:19:45,110
That's just the way things
are and that's just fine.

187
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:48,581
No it's not Jess.
You got nothing in this job and

188
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:52,943
living in this place, and
having nothing is being nothing.

189
00:19:54,686 --> 00:19:56,728
Jess, I ain't got anything either.

190
00:19:57,014 --> 00:19:58,927
We could change that

191
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:02,778
if we had what's in there.

192
00:20:03,313 --> 00:20:05,043
Is that all you came back for?

193
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,376
Silver?

194
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:13,470
You got more Morgan in you than Tyler.

195
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:17,531
Maybe so and maybe that ain't all bad.
- Oh, yes it is. Yes it is.

196
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:21,193
You know, maybe those people in
Kingman were right.

197
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,202
Bad comes from bad.

198
00:20:23,392 --> 00:20:25,501
Maybe you just are just
(?) about his daughter.

199
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:26,059
No!

200
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:29,407
Yes! You were bad when got yourself
pregnant without being married!

201
00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:33,202
What I got from it was good!
Little Danny.

202
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:38,277
Jess, the father of my baby is
Wash Gillespie.

203
00:20:38,302 --> 00:20:42,284
Who's father owns this mine. Yeah.

204
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:47,909
Oh he enjoyed himself with me pretty good, but he
couldn't stand up to his parents and marry me.

205
00:20:48,545 --> 00:20:52,404
The people who treat you so good Jess.
The good Gillespies...

206
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:56,288
they talked him out of marrying me
because I'm a Morgan and a Tyler.

207
00:20:56,313 --> 00:20:58,445
I'm not as good as Gillespie.

208
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:03,958
That don't make stealing their silver right.
- Right? They owe me and my baby!

209
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:08,394
If I take that silver, that's payment,
and that's right and it's good.

210
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:15,041
Jess, the first time I ever had a paper
dollar bill in my hand, I was 12 years old.

211
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:18,065
I let one of the boarders
spend the night with me.

212
00:21:18,556 --> 00:21:20,282
Maybe that was bad,

213
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:24,628
but the things I bought with that
money was good, and I want more.

214
00:21:24,967 --> 00:21:27,284
For me and for my baby.

215
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:33,726
I want good things for us, and if
that's bad, then I want to be bad!

216
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:38,626
I'm taking you to church.

217
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:02,581
Just remember, you're not
Bell's daughter here.

218
00:22:03,486 --> 00:22:04,676
You're mine.

219
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:17,341
- Morning John.
<i>- Jess.</i>

220
00:22:28,778 --> 00:22:31,962
<i>- Who's that?</i>
- Ed Lamey.

221
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:35,265
Some worthless relative of Moke Blue's.

222
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,553
He's a mine scavenger.

223
00:22:57,426 --> 00:22:59,406
Let us all pray.

224
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:04,953
We thank you Father for allowing us
to gather together again on this day.

225
00:23:05,857 --> 00:23:06,857
<i>Amen.</i>

226
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:11,311
We don't get many outsiders coming
around here much anymore.

227
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,540
But today, we have Kady Tyler with us.

228
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:17,687
She has been living with her
mama for some time now.

229
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,881
Well, if our simple way of life ain't too boring
for her, maybe she'll stay around for a while.

230
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:31,493
Kady Tyler living over there in Kingman coming back this
way, brings to mind the 15th chapter of the book of Luke.

231
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:34,216
Jesus told a story

232
00:23:34,774 --> 00:23:39,607
about this wealthy man who divided
his goods between his two sons.

233
00:23:40,193 --> 00:23:43,133
One of those sons saved his
portions and stayed home.

234
00:23:43,717 --> 00:23:46,939
The other one took his to a
foreign land

235
00:23:47,406 --> 00:23:51,809
and came in contacts with temptations
that he'd never been faced with before.

236
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:56,336
He gave into those temptations.
Nefarious living.

237
00:23:56,427 --> 00:24:01,861
Strong wine and the sin of lust and
fornication with the flesh of (?)

238
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:05,254
- He's talking to me.
- Shhh.

239
00:24:05,764 --> 00:24:07,363
Now, he had nothing left.

240
00:24:07,598 --> 00:24:13,033
So the son went home and faced
his father and he said Father,

241
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:16,482
I sinned against heaven before thee.

242
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,790
I should no more be called your son.

243
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:26,995
What did his father do? When his prodigal
son came home with only rags on his back.

244
00:24:27,588 --> 00:24:29,484
- Kicked his butt.
- Kady.

245
00:24:29,516 --> 00:24:32,564
He reached out for him and
hugged him he kissed him.

246
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:36,794
You should have done that to me Jess.

247
00:24:38,002 --> 00:24:41,772
My son was dead and now he's alive.

248
00:24:41,995 --> 00:24:46,437
He was lost and now he's found and
they all laughed and they rejoiced.

249
00:24:46,482 --> 00:24:48,262
Hallelujah!

250
00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:51,013
Are you the prodigal daughter?

251
00:24:51,733 --> 00:24:54,863
God forgives all sins Kady,
when you come home.

252
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,913
He'll reach down and touch you and
wash all over you with goodness!

253
00:24:58,938 --> 00:25:02,360
And cleanse your heart and soul
when you accept him!

254
00:25:05,968 --> 00:25:07,405
Kady!

255
00:25:11,147 --> 00:25:15,630
Kady! Don't do this. Don't turn away.

256
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:19,770
What was he trying to do to me?
- Trying to help you Kady.

257
00:25:19,848 --> 00:25:23,409
Then give me some help that I can
hold in my hand and put in my pocket.

258
00:25:23,493 --> 00:25:26,166
- Now let me go!
- Where you going Kady?

259
00:25:28,446 --> 00:25:29,447
Kady!

260
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,050
Reminds me a lot of Bell.

261
00:25:36,832 --> 00:25:39,190
I have been nothing to her for
ten years.

262
00:25:40,556 --> 00:25:41,970
It's hard.

263
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,945
It's been so long a time.

264
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:50,351
You can only be a daddy to her Jess.

265
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:52,873
Nothing more.

266
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,166
Come inside.

267
00:26:02,092 --> 00:26:04,213
Talk to the lord some more.

268
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:08,811
I can't.

269
00:27:43,072 --> 00:27:44,323
Morning Jess.

270
00:27:45,133 --> 00:27:47,437
- Who was that?
- A friend.

271
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:50,284
- Who was he?
- Oh, don't yell.

272
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,386
Did you lay up with him last night?

273
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:57,699
If I did would you get your
shotgun and make him marry me?

274
00:27:58,516 --> 00:28:00,250
Where was you last night?

275
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:06,276
Kady!

276
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:10,821
I met a girl and

277
00:28:10,846 --> 00:28:14,949
we got to be friends. I stayed
over there when it got too dark.

278
00:28:16,137 --> 00:28:17,473
What was her name?

279
00:28:18,668 --> 00:28:20,018
I forgot.

280
00:28:21,168 --> 00:28:23,065
It was no girl that brought you home.

281
00:28:23,366 --> 00:28:24,366
No.

282
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:26,558
Who was it then?!

283
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:30,632
Her brother.

284
00:28:34,371 --> 00:28:36,502
What did you do last night?

285
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:40,838
Enjoyed ourselves, but I don't
think you like that.

286
00:28:42,484 --> 00:28:44,047
Excuse me Jess.

287
00:28:44,988 --> 00:28:46,368
What are you gonna do?

288
00:28:47,005 --> 00:28:48,579
Women's business.

289
00:29:12,664 --> 00:29:15,035
Kady, can I come in?

290
00:29:21,206 --> 00:29:25,244
- It's hot.
- Thanks.

291
00:29:37,655 --> 00:29:38,690
Kady,

292
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:45,369
you're welcome to stay

293
00:29:46,844 --> 00:29:51,048
but I just don't want you pulling
anything like you did yesterday.

294
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:55,118
I've been thinking about it Jess.

295
00:29:56,114 --> 00:30:00,643
I just don't think it will work if I do stay here.
- Look, I don't mind you having fun every now and again.

296
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:03,165
- No, I...
- I don't even mind if you have

297
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,196
a drink once in a while, but here!

298
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:07,852
- I want money and I need money.
- Look...

299
00:30:07,908 --> 00:30:11,759
I want to help and I want you to stay here and
I want to be able to figure out what to do

300
00:30:11,817 --> 00:30:13,498
with you and your baby.
- I'm leaving tomorrow...

301
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:16,714
But I've been thinking about it and
...and find me a job.

302
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:18,369
No.

303
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:23,433
You stay here. I'm gonna work the mine.

304
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:25,371
Silver.

305
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:29,985
- (?)
- Anything

306
00:30:31,022 --> 00:30:32,998
But we just can't take
a whole lot but...

307
00:30:33,204 --> 00:30:35,602
We can take the small stuff. The chips.

308
00:30:36,362 --> 00:30:38,046
It will be enough to
keep you comfortable.

309
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:39,977
Yeah!

310
00:30:42,437 --> 00:30:45,346
Ow. Maybe I got feeling too
good last night.

311
00:30:46,072 --> 00:30:48,381
You just needed somebody to
look after you. That's all.

312
00:30:49,239 --> 00:30:51,696
From now on,
you can do whatever you want my dear.

313
00:30:51,942 --> 00:30:54,911
The only thing you'll
miss is the hangover.

314
00:30:56,904 --> 00:30:58,991
Kiss even make it feel better?

315
00:31:16,061 --> 00:31:17,764
Just rest now. Take it easy.

316
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:48,646
<i>Oh, it's scary in here Jess.
How far back are we going?</i>

317
00:31:48,677 --> 00:31:51,972
<i>Not far. Just to the room where
the main vein petered out.</i>

318
00:31:52,502 --> 00:31:54,457
<i>Are there a lot of rooms?</i>

319
00:31:54,482 --> 00:31:58,391
<i>Yeah, we dug them out
just before the mine closed.</i>

320
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:01,035
<i>Maybe there is more silver in them.</i>

321
00:32:01,147 --> 00:32:03,315
Let's go further back.

322
00:32:04,154 --> 00:32:06,222
It's too dangerous.

323
00:32:08,538 --> 00:32:12,775
Oh, what's that!
- Probably a rat. It won't bite you.

324
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,616
They're our friends. They can tell even
before God if there's any trouble down here.

325
00:32:17,962 --> 00:32:20,477
They start to run out, we follow them.

326
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,336
This is a good place for chipping.

327
00:32:31,068 --> 00:32:34,439
Look Jess. Gold!

328
00:32:34,646 --> 00:32:37,430
No, that ain't gold. It's copper.

329
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,662
Here. I'll show you.

330
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:46,548
See... all this right here is copper.
This is zinc.

331
00:32:46,802 --> 00:32:50,131
Now when copper and zinc are together,
that's when you usually find silver.

332
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:54,284
This is the drill point.
This is a single jack. Like this.

333
00:32:55,444 --> 00:32:59,137
Knock it in there like that and
pry the chips loose.

334
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:02,999
Silver?

335
00:33:03,037 --> 00:33:04,160
<i>Zinc.</i>

336
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,939
Jess, won't that take too long?
- Well...

337
00:33:12,027 --> 00:33:16,164
Can't we get some dynamite and blast out a big one?
- Dynamite? Are you kidding?

338
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,640
Dynamite would bring the sheriff and
every scavenger from miles around.

339
00:33:20,091 --> 00:33:24,427
- They can't hear us way down here.
- You'd be surprised. Sound carries down here.

340
00:33:24,751 --> 00:33:27,586
You just keep pounding like this.

341
00:33:30,028 --> 00:33:33,702
- OK.
- I'll work this side over here.

342
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:44,837
Oh...

343
00:34:06,618 --> 00:34:08,051
Kady!

344
00:34:12,037 --> 00:34:13,799
Come on Kady, wake up.

345
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:16,108
Come on.

346
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:18,944
Come on.

347
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,924
- A nice hot bath will help.
- Oh my god.

348
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:27,627
Here, put this on.

349
00:34:28,082 --> 00:34:32,605
Kady, come on. You can't sleep
dirty like that. Come on.

350
00:34:33,091 --> 00:34:35,428
Come on. You'll feel a lot better.

351
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:39,814
OK? Some miner you are.

352
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:54,043
Oh... Ahhh...

353
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:05,807
That's hot!

354
00:35:10,506 --> 00:35:12,628
Feels good.

355
00:35:13,506 --> 00:35:18,666
Is it going to be like this every day? Hurting
all over and not a thing to show for it?

356
00:35:20,854 --> 00:35:24,180
Well, they didn't close that mine down
because it has a lot of silver in it.

357
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,189
You gotta work for it.

358
00:35:26,353 --> 00:35:29,693
My shoulders feel like
somebody's been mining them.

359
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:34,448
It'll be like that for a couple days.
- Rub them down for me Jess, please.

360
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:40,787
Well, you ain't got no liniment around.

361
00:35:42,858 --> 00:35:47,196
Just rub them. Loosen them.
Oh, they hurt.

362
00:36:23,774 --> 00:36:25,185
Harder Jess.

363
00:36:29,649 --> 00:36:31,245
It takes so long this way.

364
00:36:32,741 --> 00:36:35,587
Can there be another main vein
in there?

365
00:36:36,522 --> 00:36:40,525
It's happened. It's rare.

366
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:42,975
It's happened.

367
00:36:49,805 --> 00:36:52,517
That feels so good Jess.

368
00:36:52,604 --> 00:36:54,783
You got good hands.

369
00:37:39,065 --> 00:37:42,272
- What's wrong?
- It ain't right.

370
00:37:44,326 --> 00:37:46,580
It feels good to me.

371
00:37:47,675 --> 00:37:49,739
Does it to you?

372
00:37:51,543 --> 00:37:53,332
It just ain't right.

373
00:37:55,581 --> 00:37:57,685
It's right if it's good.

374
00:37:59,227 --> 00:38:01,346
But you're my daughter Kady.

375
00:38:02,227 --> 00:38:04,058
I'm a woman too.

376
00:38:07,257 --> 00:38:09,036
Sometimes, I need.

377
00:38:12,465 --> 00:38:13,879
We both do.

378
00:38:23,248 --> 00:38:27,352
- No.
- No.

379
00:38:49,944 --> 00:38:53,911
Kady, you got to be careful.
- Ow! Shit! Bitch! Damn!

380
00:38:53,936 --> 00:38:56,812
I told you, you got to be careful!

381
00:38:57,818 --> 00:39:00,774
I'm going to be careful. I'm
gonna be careful getting

382
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:04,836
that better way of making money.
There is no god damn silver in here.

383
00:39:04,861 --> 00:39:08,738
I'm getting out!
- You got to more gentle, that's all.

384
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,807
You didn't hear me. I'm getting out!
- Kady,

385
00:39:13,843 --> 00:39:18,079
see this. You know what that is?
That's silver.

386
00:39:19,263 --> 00:39:21,227
Look at that.

387
00:39:23,702 --> 00:39:26,919
It's green!
- That's right. Silver is green.

388
00:39:27,014 --> 00:39:30,379
The chippets are. Of course,
if you hit a main vein, it's silver, but

389
00:39:30,404 --> 00:39:33,169
silver ore is all green.

390
00:39:34,294 --> 00:39:38,697
Oh my God! Look Jess. Look at
this. I've been throwing

391
00:39:38,722 --> 00:39:42,991
this stuff away for an hour. Look! Look!
- Silver!

392
00:39:43,727 --> 00:39:46,180
How much is it worth?
- About 90 cents an ounce.

393
00:39:46,214 --> 00:39:48,066
At least a hundred dollars here!

394
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:51,849
Oh my God, we're rich!
When do we get the money for it?

395
00:39:51,926 --> 00:39:55,962
In a few days, we will take it over
to Colville and sell it over there..

396
00:39:56,443 --> 00:40:00,747
<i>Let's get to work.
Oh we're going to be rich, Jess. Rich!</i>

397
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:12,485
Stop here Jess!

398
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:16,626
What for? The office is further down.
- I'm gonna get a new dress.

399
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:20,744
You get yourself a new suit, a
shave, and a hair cut,

400
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:25,106
because we're gonna celebrate!
- OK! See you later!

401
00:40:41,343 --> 00:40:42,772
<i>Can I help you sir?</i>

402
00:40:42,797 --> 00:40:45,852
Yes, I'm looking for a girl.

403
00:40:46,398 --> 00:40:50,171
Brown eyes, pretty.
She came in here a little while ago.

404
00:40:50,196 --> 00:40:52,104
- Yes, named Kady.
- That's right.

405
00:40:52,266 --> 00:40:56,369
She said a man would be in to pay for
the dress she bought. That's 8 dollars.

406
00:41:03,284 --> 00:41:08,274
Your friend has very good taste in cloth.
- She's my daughter.

407
00:41:11,414 --> 00:41:16,496
Where did she go?
- She went to the White Horse Cafe. Just across the street.

408
00:42:16,986 --> 00:42:18,354
Kady.

409
00:42:18,948 --> 00:42:21,233
Hey now!

410
00:42:22,717 --> 00:42:26,166
Don't you look good!

411
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:30,778
You really think so?
- You're the best looking man in the place.

412
00:42:30,825 --> 00:42:34,827
How much did we get?
- 210 dollars.

413
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:40,095
210 dollars! Let's celebrate!
Sit down and have a drink.

414
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:43,086
Why don't we just go home and
celebrate?

415
00:42:43,915 --> 00:42:48,119
This is Richard. This is Billy Roy.
That's my daddy.

416
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:51,546
Richard, get daddy a drink.
- Oh you got it.

417
00:42:54,378 --> 00:42:56,501
Sit down.

418
00:42:58,828 --> 00:43:00,932
What are you drinking?

419
00:43:03,088 --> 00:43:05,195
Um... Coca-Cola.

420
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,450
On Coke Patty.

421
00:43:08,233 --> 00:43:10,307
Is that really your daughter?

422
00:43:13,646 --> 00:43:16,032
I was just asking.

423
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:21,998
<i>Old man don't look like he's in a
good mood.</i> Let's get out of here.

424
00:43:23,205 --> 00:43:24,693
OK.

425
00:43:51,341 --> 00:43:54,542
You ready to go?
- Have another drink, Jess.

426
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:57,489
- I wanna be on.
- Where you going?

427
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:02,500
Billy Roy's got a brand new convertible
car. He's gonna take me for a ride.

428
00:44:06,544 --> 00:44:07,968
Why?

429
00:44:09,944 --> 00:44:12,087
Because sometimes...

430
00:44:12,676 --> 00:44:15,826
people need to be made to feel good.

431
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:20,781
Kady. No, Kady!

432
00:44:20,806 --> 00:44:23,404
Listen, pops, take it easy
and we won't have any trouble.

433
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:27,465
I am her daddy and she's staying here with me.
- It's not like she wants to old man,

434
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:30,937
and right now she wants to go for a ride.
So, that's what we are going to do.

435
00:44:31,074 --> 00:44:34,597
Sit down and have yourself a glass
of prune juice and loosen up.

436
00:44:34,766 --> 00:44:36,730
When we get back
here with her, you can have her.

437
00:44:36,755 --> 00:44:39,564
- But not before.
<i>- Kady.</i>

438
00:44:47,694 --> 00:44:48,995
Don't do this Kady.

439
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:50,458
<i>Oh, daddy...</i>

440
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:55,335
You never stopped Bell from doing it.

441
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:58,114
Don't stop me.

442
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:05,770
Come home with me.

443
00:45:05,882 --> 00:45:07,980
It'll be different.

444
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,256
Stay down daddy. Stay down.

445
00:45:22,281 --> 00:45:25,325
<i>Kady, get to the truck!</i>

446
00:45:27,596 --> 00:45:30,560
Get to the truck Kady!

447
00:45:33,207 --> 00:45:35,180
Leave Kady!

448
00:45:36,496 --> 00:45:38,785
Get out of here Kady!

449
00:45:40,778 --> 00:45:42,881
Kady! Get out of here Kady!

450
00:45:43,432 --> 00:45:45,158
No!

451
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:51,047
Get off me! My eyes! My eyes!

452
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:56,793
<i>- Get off of me!</i>
- Go get the sheriff.

453
00:46:19,008 --> 00:46:20,713
Kady.

454
00:46:32,257 --> 00:46:33,503
<i>- Your honor.
- Oh!?</i>

455
00:46:34,597 --> 00:46:36,817
You got anything to say before...

456
00:46:37,126 --> 00:46:39,306
sentence is passed on you?

457
00:46:39,524 --> 00:46:43,290
The only reason I was in that furniture
store was for the beds.

458
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,578
I didn't take nothing out.

459
00:46:45,703 --> 00:46:48,379
They caught you before you had a chance.

460
00:46:49,629 --> 00:46:51,516
Got any money?

461
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:56,786
I was only trying to get a good night's rest your honor.
- How much?

462
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,869
Two dollars.

463
00:46:58,918 --> 00:47:02,288
Two dollars is the fine
you are to rest in this community.

464
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:06,347
I was just passing through.
- Well, you were with us long enough to

465
00:47:06,372 --> 00:47:09,148
catch up with your sleep. Sixteen days.

466
00:47:09,573 --> 00:47:11,080
Next case!

467
00:47:11,115 --> 00:47:14,684
Tyler and Tyler versus White Horse Cafe.

468
00:47:15,045 --> 00:47:17,742
Won't take much to figure that one out.

469
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:21,001
- Tyler.
- Yes sir.

470
00:47:25,192 --> 00:47:26,685
<i>This is your daughter?</i>

471
00:47:27,221 --> 00:47:28,221
Yes.

472
00:47:29,404 --> 00:47:35,412
Well, now, this court is not about to
make a criminal out of a father defending

473
00:47:36,107 --> 00:47:38,426
the honor of his daughter.

474
00:47:40,704 --> 00:47:44,017
Now, however there are a few
charges that can't be overlooked.

475
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:47,957
Disturbing the peace,
destruction of private property though

476
00:47:47,982 --> 00:47:53,091
How much a joint like that,
White Horse is worth, I wouldn't know.

477
00:47:53,483 --> 00:47:57,008
I mean considering the kind of
trash it caters to and the transient

478
00:47:57,033 --> 00:48:01,069
no goods that come sailing
through the great state of Nevada.

479
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,303
There's no excuse for you Tyler.

480
00:48:05,462 --> 00:48:07,935
- You're no tourist.
- No sir.

481
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,172
- And you're no transient.
- No sir.

482
00:48:11,474 --> 00:48:16,261
Oh you're part of our own God-fearing community.
How much money you got in your pocket?

483
00:48:16,691 --> 00:48:21,428
Umm. About twelve dollars.

484
00:48:21,676 --> 00:48:25,946
Disorderly conduct, five dollars. Court
costs, five dollars. Two dollars damages.

485
00:48:25,971 --> 00:48:30,066
Pay the clerk or maybe you would
like to work for the county too?

486
00:48:30,091 --> 00:48:32,455
No, I'd rather pay.

487
00:48:32,991 --> 00:48:35,245
As for you, young woman.

488
00:48:37,156 --> 00:48:39,207
How old are you?

489
00:48:39,497 --> 00:48:40,948
Seventeen sir.

490
00:48:41,011 --> 00:48:42,912
Come closer. I didn't hear you.

491
00:48:45,245 --> 00:48:46,528
Come closer.

492
00:48:56,293 --> 00:48:57,576
Closer.

493
00:49:04,355 --> 00:49:06,594
Seventeen eh?

494
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:09,138
Sixteen.

495
00:49:13,353 --> 00:49:15,187
You been drinking?

496
00:49:16,352 --> 00:49:18,904
- I don't know sir.
- You don't know?

497
00:49:21,707 --> 00:49:24,886
Well sir, I was drinking Coca-cola

498
00:49:25,901 --> 00:49:27,765
but you know how it is.

499
00:49:29,826 --> 00:49:31,906
- You tell me how it is.
- OK.

500
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:37,966
Sometimes they put a little
something in it, just for fun.

501
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,600
Butchers.

502
00:49:42,919 --> 00:49:44,808
Let me smell your breath.

503
00:49:44,936 --> 00:49:49,006
But today, I don't know if they did or n..
- I want to smell.

504
00:49:53,444 --> 00:49:55,866
You are still not close enough.

505
00:50:06,984 --> 00:50:09,004
<i>Psst. Psst.</i>

506
00:50:27,761 --> 00:50:29,343
Discipline!

507
00:50:29,499 --> 00:50:35,325
A wayward minor. That's a nice
legal word for what you are.

508
00:50:35,416 --> 00:50:39,293
And that's quite enough for me to have
you committed, Do you realize that?

509
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:43,529
Send you straight up to the reform
school. Isn't that where you belong?

510
00:50:44,724 --> 00:50:47,373
First complaint I hear from him.

511
00:50:48,023 --> 00:50:52,060
You're up for commitment. Understand?
- Yes, your honor.

512
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:54,951
Discipline!

513
00:50:55,607 --> 00:50:57,942
You're her father man.

514
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:00,521
Next case.

515
00:51:06,561 --> 00:51:09,628
Discipline!

516
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:27,344
Discipline! Discipline!

517
00:51:29,439 --> 00:51:33,034
<i>It's a good thing you didn't tell that
judge how much money we really have.</i>

518
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:37,229
You didn't want me let that judge put you in reform school, haven't you?
- You wouldn't and besides

519
00:51:37,254 --> 00:51:40,925
that he'd like to put me
somewhere else, right.

520
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:44,630
Don't talk like that.
- You noticed too.

521
00:51:44,655 --> 00:51:47,086
I didn't want to smile too much at him.

522
00:51:47,111 --> 00:51:49,820
I'm afraid you'd start
beating up on him.

523
00:51:49,845 --> 00:51:54,619
Then you'd end up in jail for sure.
- Doesn't it shame you just a little bit to go making up

524
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:59,014
to every single man you meet?
- What's to be ashamed of?

525
00:51:59,373 --> 00:52:03,376
Well, I guess it's just in the blood.
- I don't want to hear any more of that Morgan stuff.

526
00:52:03,932 --> 00:52:06,996
Well, it's inbred. You got to
be aware of it.

527
00:52:07,635 --> 00:52:11,661
I'm aware of it. Are you?

528
00:52:12,674 --> 00:52:17,211
I am.
- You'd like to have me tonight wouldn't you Jess?

529
00:52:17,236 --> 00:52:20,803
Now Kady now...
Come on Kady, don't do that.

530
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:25,810
Kady, I got to watch the road.
- It must be lonely plenty.

531
00:52:28,355 --> 00:52:31,535
Let's stop an have another drink somewhere, Jess.
- Oh, no!

532
00:52:32,714 --> 00:52:36,926
How about you going to that reform school?
- Oh yeah.

533
00:52:51,336 --> 00:52:55,807
Jane! Jane!

534
00:53:00,257 --> 00:53:02,256
- Great to see you out here!
- Likewise!

535
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:11,408
How's Danny?
He's fine. He's in the house.

536
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:22,212
Jane.

537
00:53:23,961 --> 00:53:25,036
Daddy.

538
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,886
See my baby?

539
00:53:32,141 --> 00:53:34,087
What a pretty baby.

540
00:53:34,927 --> 00:53:36,776
He's your grandson!

541
00:55:20,885 --> 00:55:23,556
OK Danny, come on.

542
00:55:27,484 --> 00:55:31,034
I'll help you Janey.
Hold him for me will you Jess.

543
00:55:39,526 --> 00:55:43,630
He just ate.
Will you burp him for me Jess?

544
00:55:44,636 --> 00:55:47,220
You remember how to do that?

545
00:56:01,642 --> 00:56:04,073
That a boy. Yeah.

546
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:06,377
Oh, he's a fine boy.

547
00:56:07,245 --> 00:56:10,904
Gonna make a fine man. Aren't yah?

548
00:56:19,395 --> 00:56:21,309
Hey, what's this?

549
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:28,843
It's a birthmark Jess.
It don't come off.

550
00:56:30,693 --> 00:56:32,973
Oh, he's so sweet.

551
00:56:33,345 --> 00:56:37,614
Yes he is. He is so wonderful.

552
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:42,426
He's such a sweet boy!
- How'd you like to have a son-in-law, Jess?

553
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:49,871
What do you mean?
Well, I ran into Wash in Kingman.

554
00:56:50,218 --> 00:56:52,738
We had a good talk and he told
me what happened.

555
00:56:53,049 --> 00:56:57,696
His parents made him leave Kady.
- He's not too strong.

556
00:56:58,404 --> 00:57:02,607
Are you taking his side now?
- But they changed their minds.

557
00:57:02,976 --> 00:57:07,313
Everything is fine now and he
wants to marry her. He always did.

558
00:57:11,183 --> 00:57:13,432
He doesn't sound like
much of a man to me.

559
00:57:14,405 --> 00:57:18,443
Maybe he's not... right now.

560
00:57:23,853 --> 00:57:27,990
He's coming for me tomorrow.

561
00:57:41,352 --> 00:57:43,348
Oh... He's here!

562
00:57:44,462 --> 00:57:46,529
Wash is here!

563
00:57:52,282 --> 00:57:56,172
Kady! Kady!

564
00:58:04,961 --> 00:58:08,148
- Kady!
- Wash! Wash!

565
00:58:09,634 --> 00:58:14,331
Wash Gillespie, I don't give a damn
if this is your property or not.

566
00:58:14,497 --> 00:58:19,844
You turn that big new car around and go right back
to your mama and daddy. Do you understand me?

567
00:58:21,879 --> 00:58:22,879
Heh...

568
00:58:24,856 --> 00:58:29,094
Didn't Janey tell you I was coming?
- Yeah, she told me.

569
00:58:29,463 --> 00:58:33,632
And you thought I'd just be sitting
around here waiting, wide open for you.

570
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:38,092
Well, I got one baby sucking on me.
I don't need another.

571
00:58:41,728 --> 00:58:45,034
Honey, I'm sorry. I apologize.
I came here to marry you.

572
00:58:45,318 --> 00:58:50,355
Oh, is there something making you
think I wanna marry you?

573
00:58:50,628 --> 00:58:53,938
Heh, yeah. I thought you loved me.

574
00:58:54,029 --> 00:58:57,174
And I thought I was loving a
man, not a mama's boy.

575
00:58:57,722 --> 00:59:01,750
You go on home Wash. When you decide
whose skirt your gonna chase

576
00:59:01,775 --> 00:59:06,442
hers or mine, then you come back
and see if I'm still around.

577
00:59:07,546 --> 00:59:09,444
Kady! Honey!

578
00:59:11,026 --> 00:59:14,355
Honey look, it's you. I want you.

579
00:59:14,961 --> 00:59:18,384
And I mean to have you. I mean
to marry you.

580
00:59:18,841 --> 00:59:21,776
- I ain't heard you ask me.
- I'm asking.

581
00:59:23,568 --> 00:59:24,568
Ask.

582
00:59:39,631 --> 00:59:41,264
Will you marry me?

583
00:59:42,104 --> 00:59:43,462
<i>Yes!</i>

584
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:54,449
Take it easy. Where'd you learn
how to drive?

585
00:59:56,119 --> 00:59:58,578
Easy! Easy! Use the brakes!

586
00:59:58,756 --> 01:00:01,624
After we're married,
you gotta buy me one of these, Wash.

587
01:00:02,254 --> 01:00:04,795
The color to match my eyes.

588
01:00:06,157 --> 01:00:08,266
This is Wash!

589
01:00:11,845 --> 01:00:15,275
Figures.
- Wash, this is Jess, my daddy.

590
01:00:16,965 --> 01:00:17,965
Sir.

591
01:00:20,266 --> 01:00:21,752
How are you?

592
01:00:27,222 --> 01:00:28,784
This is your son.

593
01:00:36,859 --> 01:00:38,951
Hey Danny, old timer.

594
01:00:42,065 --> 01:00:44,208
I'd like to marry your daughter, sir.

595
01:00:44,373 --> 01:00:47,054
And I'd like your permission
and your blessing.

596
01:00:47,182 --> 01:00:50,891
Well, it's a little late for me to go
on being protective daddy.

597
01:00:51,285 --> 01:00:53,514
Maybe but not for me.

598
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:58,659
Uh, and I would like to apologize to
everybody for the way that I acted

599
01:00:59,862 --> 01:01:03,371
and tell you that she will never want
for anything as long as she lives.

600
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,685
You got my word on that Jess.

601
01:01:08,352 --> 01:01:09,367
Well...

602
01:01:09,978 --> 01:01:12,492
If you make her happy.

603
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,691
He will.

604
01:01:17,037 --> 01:01:19,947
Come on into my house Wash Gillespie.

605
01:01:42,185 --> 01:01:44,498
I don't want to make
all the arrangements.

606
01:01:45,692 --> 01:01:47,958
We will get married
the day after tomorrow.

607
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:52,824
There's a hotel in Goldfield where my
parents mommy, daddy and I can stay.

608
01:01:53,048 --> 01:01:54,655
It's a little quick.

609
01:01:56,617 --> 01:01:59,364
I don't want to waste any more time.

610
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:23,536
Your folks weren't coming up
here tonight, was they Wash?

611
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:24,952
Uh, no sir.

612
01:02:26,348 --> 01:02:29,160
Only one truck sounds like that.
It's Ed Lamey's.

613
01:02:33,161 --> 01:02:34,361
Jane.

614
01:02:53,881 --> 01:02:56,102
Ain't holding Jess. Ain't holding.

615
01:02:57,123 --> 01:02:59,216
Wouldn't come to your
house if I was holding.

616
01:02:59,733 --> 01:03:03,969
If you was holding Moke Blue
you'd be on your way to hell right now.

617
01:03:04,763 --> 01:03:06,492
Now, turn around and
get off this property.

618
01:03:06,705 --> 01:03:09,919
Now hold on Jess. I come here
on peacable terms.

619
01:03:11,244 --> 01:03:15,280
My golly, it looks like a family
reunion here. Janey, Kady...

620
01:03:15,929 --> 01:03:18,166
I saw you with that boy Jess.

621
01:03:18,582 --> 01:03:22,173
Ain't that a fine boy.
- What are you doing here Moke?

622
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:25,678
Mr. Gillespie, how do you do?

623
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,606
I brought you something Jess.

624
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,281
Yes sir.

625
01:03:33,783 --> 01:03:35,398
A surprise for you.

626
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:38,323
Come on Ed,
give me a hand here, will ya,

627
01:03:38,633 --> 01:03:41,060
He keeps the rifle on
the truck if he gets out.

628
01:03:41,373 --> 01:03:42,500
<i>Right!</i>

629
01:03:43,382 --> 01:03:46,238
- Ain't you ready yet?
- Just a minute!

630
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:55,195
It's Bell, Jess! It's Bell!

631
01:03:57,465 --> 01:04:00,323
You look just fine. Wait a minute!

632
01:04:00,348 --> 01:04:02,287
There you go.

633
01:04:10,004 --> 01:04:14,376
You're alright. You're alright.

634
01:04:23,185 --> 01:04:24,361
Well,

635
01:04:28,428 --> 01:04:31,370
well, hell Jess,
can't you even say hello?

636
01:04:37,015 --> 01:04:38,669
Hello Bell.

637
01:04:39,155 --> 01:04:41,236
Ain't that some surprise?

638
01:04:41,384 --> 01:04:46,448
See, Janey said Kady was over here getting married.
So when I ran over here at the Kingman, I...

639
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:49,511
said,

640
01:04:49,926 --> 01:04:54,540
hell Bell, why don't we just drive over and
see that? Her whole family is over here.

641
01:04:54,565 --> 01:04:57,631
She was feeling lonesome, so...
- Shut up Moke.

642
01:05:01,081 --> 01:05:03,636
Well, I

643
01:05:03,678 --> 01:05:06,080
did want to see Kady get married.

644
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:12,296
And, um, I wanted to see
little Danny boy again.

645
01:05:12,845 --> 01:05:16,381
You see Jess holding that boy when
we drove up? Wasn't that a sight?

646
01:05:26,641 --> 01:05:28,535
Get me inside.

647
01:05:30,232 --> 01:05:33,915
<i>The drive over in Ed's
truck damn near killed me.</i>

648
01:05:34,112 --> 01:05:36,225
Must've been harder
on him on Moke though.

649
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,517
Bouncing up and down on their
brains like that.

650
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:52,307
There's my girls!

651
01:05:52,643 --> 01:05:55,990
Come on over and give your mama a kiss!

652
01:06:01,798 --> 01:06:05,936
Here's the baby! Oh Danny boy!

653
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,265
Sure knows how to keep him in line.

654
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,598
He ain't got much backbone.

655
01:06:33,502 --> 01:06:36,404
Plenty of what makes life good.

656
01:06:37,933 --> 01:06:39,804
Money... huh Jess?

657
01:06:40,384 --> 01:06:43,275
- Money ain't everything Bell.
- No.

658
01:06:44,131 --> 01:06:47,628
But it runs a good second best
to what she caught him with.

659
01:06:53,478 --> 01:06:55,775
You'd better take some lessons
from her honey.

660
01:06:56,970 --> 01:07:00,172
Janey is just like you Jess... stoney.

661
01:07:01,195 --> 01:07:05,131
You know you was born with your
hands between your legs honey.

662
01:07:05,836 --> 01:07:07,739
You ain't took them out since.

663
01:07:10,397 --> 01:07:12,349
I love you.

664
01:07:12,605 --> 01:07:16,608
You just gotta go snap, you know.

665
01:07:16,664 --> 01:07:19,960
Loosen up or you're just gonna

666
01:07:20,153 --> 01:07:24,837
wind up as dried up and barren
as that desert out there!

667
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,811
You know what I mean.

668
01:07:41,566 --> 01:07:42,665
Let's

669
01:07:49,828 --> 01:07:50,828
Bell!

670
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,069
<i>Oh god, she's bleeding again!</i>

671
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:57,290
<i>Get her on the bed.</i>

672
01:07:57,602 --> 01:07:59,276
<i>Put Danny on the couch.</i>

673
01:08:32,485 --> 01:08:34,163
I'm gonna die.

674
01:08:37,025 --> 01:08:40,455
- Awful sorry Bell.
- Hell, I'm not.

675
01:08:41,966 --> 01:08:43,971
I made a mess of my life.

676
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:49,951
You lived your life you wanted to.
- I lived it like I liked it.

677
01:08:52,816 --> 01:08:54,663
Like I wanted.

678
01:08:56,361 --> 01:08:59,998
Jess, there's something I gotta
tell you.

679
01:09:00,532 --> 01:09:04,703
I gotta tell you
something... something that

680
01:09:06,568 --> 01:09:08,837
What is it?

681
01:09:10,103 --> 01:09:11,270
Jess...

682
01:09:12,823 --> 01:09:15,779
- Jess...
- What is it Bell?

683
01:09:24,379 --> 01:09:25,779
Is my makeup off?

684
01:09:27,222 --> 01:09:28,591
A little bit.

685
01:09:30,723 --> 01:09:33,323
Get Kady and Jane for me.

686
01:09:35,161 --> 01:09:37,341
Put some on for me OK?

687
01:09:38,652 --> 01:09:40,098
Alright.

688
01:09:46,514 --> 01:09:48,647
Jane, Kady,

689
01:10:03,764 --> 01:10:07,201
Yeah, that Kady has turned into
a real good looking woman.

690
01:10:08,025 --> 01:10:10,002
Must make a man proud, huh Jess?

691
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:15,315
You're a lucky man Mr. Gillespie.

692
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:18,317
- Lucky man.
- I think so Mr. Blue.

693
01:10:18,551 --> 01:10:23,663
You got a good-looking woman
a growing heir and silver.

694
01:10:24,341 --> 01:10:28,344
Say Jess, you know that silver
is up to 90 cents an ounce now.

695
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:32,324
If it goes up just a little bit more

696
01:10:32,349 --> 01:10:35,984
it might be worth your while to open up this
mine again Mr. Gillespie. I mean, maybe

697
01:10:36,009 --> 01:10:41,074
it petered out, but then again, maybe it didn't.
And you could put old Jess there in charge.

698
01:10:41,099 --> 01:10:45,202
Jess knows everything there is to
know about mining, don't you Jess?

699
01:10:46,323 --> 01:10:48,830
Hell Mr. Gillespie, I bet you Jess here

700
01:10:48,855 --> 01:10:52,190
could put a good piece of change in
your pocket just mining the small

701
01:10:52,215 --> 01:10:56,252
bits, and if he didn't another load

702
01:10:57,139 --> 01:11:02,201
It is something worth thinking about, isn't it?
I mean, the price of silver going up and all.

703
01:11:06,005 --> 01:11:10,243
How is that old girl?
- She wants to see you.

704
01:11:25,744 --> 01:11:29,413
- How you feeling Bell?
- Come here Moke.

705
01:11:30,529 --> 01:11:31,657
Come.

706
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:35,362
What'd you and Jess talk about?

707
01:11:39,506 --> 01:11:40,675
Oh,

708
01:11:44,213 --> 01:11:47,192
we talked about a long time ago.

709
01:11:47,217 --> 01:11:49,212
You talk about us?

710
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,896
I couldn't.

711
01:11:58,662 --> 01:12:02,832
Would you help me get my shoes off?

712
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:07,326
Sure.

713
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:09,079
Sure.

714
01:12:14,435 --> 01:12:16,545
Oh, yesseree

715
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:20,936
I know these feet. These sweet
little old things.

716
01:12:24,849 --> 01:12:26,534
Damn you!

717
01:12:37,919 --> 01:12:39,380
She tried to kill me.

718
01:12:39,603 --> 01:12:43,454
She was trying to stab me with that damn
big pin in her hat.

719
01:12:43,772 --> 01:12:47,808
The crazy fool stabbed me tried to
chase me. She wanted to kill me.

720
01:12:49,694 --> 01:12:53,387
- Why?
- She wanted me to

721
01:12:53,498 --> 01:12:57,667
go down to hell with her, I guess. I
don't know. The sickness made her crazy.

722
01:12:58,572 --> 01:13:01,355
I don't think killing you would
be called crazy Moke.

723
01:13:02,844 --> 01:13:05,270
Now you get out of this house,

724
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:08,439
or I will finish for her.

725
01:13:21,678 --> 01:13:25,473
Be good to Mr. Gillespie, you hear me?
You make him a good wife.

726
01:13:25,498 --> 01:13:26,826
Get out!

727
01:14:48,258 --> 01:14:49,423
Damn.

728
01:14:56,642 --> 01:14:58,162
Time's up Moke.

729
01:15:00,311 --> 01:15:04,247
Alright. Now easy Jess, easy. Now don't
get nervous with that thing, will you.

730
01:15:05,141 --> 01:15:07,793
You didn't bring Bell back here to see
the family.

731
01:15:08,161 --> 01:15:10,595
You ain't got that much good in you.

732
01:15:12,867 --> 01:15:14,936
Well, I guess you're right, Jess.

733
01:15:15,015 --> 01:15:17,782
I can't compare
to you when it comes to goodness.

734
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,130
You're so good.

735
01:15:21,332 --> 01:15:23,720
I don't think you got
it in you to shoot me.

736
01:15:25,995 --> 01:15:30,282
That's enought. Leave it alone.
- No, Jess, you can't do it.

737
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:34,010
I ran off with your
wife you couldn't do it.

738
01:15:34,035 --> 01:15:38,351
So, I sure as hell don't think you're going to shoot
me now for stealing silver that ain't even yours.

739
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:43,787
Oh yeah, Ed came over and told me that you and Kady
were working the mine. That's why I come here.

740
01:15:43,838 --> 01:15:45,014
Ed saw yah.

741
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:47,068
So,

742
01:15:49,237 --> 01:15:52,358
you can take me on down to jail if

743
01:15:52,383 --> 01:15:54,758
you wanna share a cell with me.

744
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:58,541
But I know you ain't got guts
enough to shoot me.

745
01:16:06,857 --> 01:16:08,023
You

746
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:10,424
What?

747
01:16:11,617 --> 01:16:12,757
That mark.

748
01:16:13,862 --> 01:16:16,082
That's the same mark
on little Danny's belly.

749
01:16:16,301 --> 01:16:19,453
Oh yeah... that mark.

750
01:16:19,947 --> 01:16:22,299
All the boys in the family got
that marking.

751
01:16:24,129 --> 01:16:28,365
You pig! You laid up with my daughter?!

752
01:16:29,325 --> 01:16:31,707
I laid up with

753
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:40,467
What are you talking about

754
01:17:00,476 --> 01:17:02,093
God, Jess, it's burning.

755
01:17:02,772 --> 01:17:06,959
You will burn in hell... the both of you for
marking up a poor little kid like that!

756
01:17:07,579 --> 01:17:08,834
You're crazy.

757
01:17:11,091 --> 01:17:14,336
I saw it and Bell knew about it too.

758
01:17:14,361 --> 01:17:18,454
That's why she tried to kill you.
- No, hell no.

759
01:17:18,674 --> 01:17:21,434
We got that marking in our family.

760
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,753
Only the men get it.

761
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:30,896
If the baby's a girl, it skips.

762
01:17:30,964 --> 01:17:33,320
It skips to the next boy.

763
01:17:33,818 --> 01:17:36,724
You see the women are carriers.

764
01:17:38,702 --> 01:17:42,938
Danny ain't your grandson, you
soft singing bastard.

765
01:17:43,597 --> 01:17:44,883
He's mine!

766
01:17:55,276 --> 01:17:56,497
God Jess.

767
01:17:56,522 --> 01:17:58,628
There is stuff coming out of me
and it stinks.

768
01:17:59,735 --> 01:18:03,863
Get me a doctor.
Kady is not my daughter?

769
01:18:07,165 --> 01:18:08,785
Bell and me. We didn't know

770
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:11,977
it for 17 years... not till
Danny came along and

771
01:18:12,002 --> 01:18:13,885
we seen the marking.

772
01:18:16,295 --> 01:18:18,807
She's not my blood.

773
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:23,320
You ain't a drop of Tyler
blood in Kady or Danny.

774
01:18:24,536 --> 01:18:27,846
Bell tried to kill me because she
thought I come here to claim him.

775
01:18:28,294 --> 01:18:32,691
Hell, I don't care about them.
I wanted the silver.

776
01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:37,613
Kady.

777
01:18:42,135 --> 01:18:45,202
Get me a doctor Jess, please.

778
01:18:46,764 --> 01:18:48,606
Get me a doctor.

779
01:19:06,536 --> 01:19:10,873
God, what are you doing Jess?

780
01:19:11,488 --> 01:19:12,695
You're crazy!

781
01:19:14,696 --> 01:19:18,999
Jess don't do it! You can't do this!

782
01:19:19,445 --> 01:19:23,749
Jess, you're crazy! Don't
please! Don't do this!

783
01:19:23,774 --> 01:19:27,977
Don't do it! Don't!

784
01:19:28,526 --> 01:19:32,662
Don't! Jess!

785
01:19:32,743 --> 01:19:36,880
Please!

786
01:20:23,593 --> 01:20:25,774
Jess! Come on in!

787
01:20:25,966 --> 01:20:30,864
Well, well, Jess Tyler, How are
you Jess?

788
01:20:31,051 --> 01:20:33,676
It's been a long time... too long.

789
01:20:33,889 --> 01:20:36,522
It's not going to be that way
anymore not after tomorrow.

790
01:20:36,752 --> 01:20:39,625
Listen, you've never
met my wife. Helen! Helen!

791
01:20:39,650 --> 01:20:44,424
Come on out and say hello to Jess Tyler.
- Mrs. Gillespie.

792
01:20:44,645 --> 01:20:49,178
How do you do Mr. Tyler.
I heard my husband mention you often.

793
01:20:49,486 --> 01:20:51,868
Always very highly as a matter of fact.

794
01:20:51,961 --> 01:20:56,131
Jess Tyler was the most honest and upstanding
man I ever knew. I always said that.

795
01:20:58,352 --> 01:21:00,819
I wish all my employees were like that.

796
01:21:03,227 --> 01:21:04,227
Jess!

797
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:08,721
How about a little drink?
- Oh no thank you. I don't...

798
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:11,823
Nonsense! This is a celebration.

799
01:21:12,224 --> 01:21:16,194
Joining our families together and
us becoming grandparents to the kids.

800
01:21:18,015 --> 01:21:22,284
To Danny! Did you bring the
bride with you Mr. Tyler?

801
01:21:22,385 --> 01:21:25,752
And the boy? I can't wait to
see my grandson.

802
01:21:26,791 --> 01:21:29,390
No, I didn't bring them.

803
01:21:30,382 --> 01:21:31,382
Jess.

804
01:21:34,766 --> 01:21:35,953
Something wrong?

805
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,792
I just found out something and

806
01:21:41,811 --> 01:21:47,326
Well, I'm afraid I haven't been much of father to her.
- Nonsense! You did what you had to do.

807
01:21:48,274 --> 01:21:50,677
Living in there in that boarding house

808
01:21:51,626 --> 01:21:53,553
and mother working all the time.

809
01:21:53,922 --> 01:21:59,546
I'm afraid she... well, she...
might have picked up some ways.

810
01:21:59,658 --> 01:22:04,234
It was probably inevitable
living under Bell's guidance

811
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:08,721
that she would mature earlier
than most young ladies Mr. Tyler.

812
01:22:09,346 --> 01:22:11,980
Maybe had I been around,
things would have been different.

813
01:22:12,067 --> 01:22:16,404
But they're not Jess. Now we got to put
things where they belong... in the past.

814
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:21,634
Now, we are all ready to forget the
circumstances and accept the responsibilities.

815
01:22:21,814 --> 01:22:24,602
Danny is our grandson. Wash's boy.

816
01:22:24,627 --> 01:22:26,774
- No he aint.
- What?

817
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:31,807
Danny isn't Wash's baby.

818
01:22:33,255 --> 01:22:34,921
He's Moke Blue's.

819
01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:37,590
Who?

820
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:41,673
That marking on Danny's stomach.

821
01:22:43,691 --> 01:22:47,862
Moke Blue has the exact same
mark in the exact same place.

822
01:22:55,986 --> 01:22:57,399
I'm awful sorry.

823
01:23:01,413 --> 01:23:03,470
Everybody's birth marks.

824
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:09,151
Dear, a baby and a man have identical
birthmarks.

825
01:23:09,644 --> 01:23:11,584
How could not mean anything?

826
01:23:14,641 --> 01:23:18,459
Not with Moke Blue Jess. He's
old enough to be her father.

827
01:23:19,726 --> 01:23:22,075
Not with him. She couldn't.

828
01:23:22,704 --> 01:23:23,827
Yes she could.

829
01:23:26,216 --> 01:23:28,068
Considering the way that she was raised.

830
01:23:28,377 --> 01:23:32,031
I can't believe it and
I'm going to ask her.

831
01:23:32,924 --> 01:23:33,924
No.

832
01:23:35,317 --> 01:23:36,673
It would only hurt you.

833
01:23:39,041 --> 01:23:40,680
And everybody else.

834
01:23:42,508 --> 01:23:47,488
I think it's best if you just...
don't see her again.

835
01:23:50,328 --> 01:23:51,328
Ever.

836
01:24:01,066 --> 01:24:02,066
Bye.

837
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:22,138
Hi Jess. How do I look?

838
01:24:22,713 --> 01:24:23,881
Beautiful.

839
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,988
How you gonna like giving me away?

840
01:24:29,222 --> 01:24:31,403
I want you to be happy.

841
01:24:33,215 --> 01:24:38,379
I'm going to get everything I want
and you too Jess. I'll see to it.

842
01:24:40,387 --> 01:24:42,977
<i>Kady! Kady! He's coming!</i>

843
01:24:44,636 --> 01:24:47,329
<i>No, that's not Wash's car.</i>

844
01:24:47,364 --> 01:24:50,297
<i>- Looked like it, I guess.
- But it won't be long.</i>

845
01:24:51,136 --> 01:24:53,524
<i>You'll be Mrs. Gillespie!</i>

846
01:24:55,107 --> 01:24:59,344
<i>Get ready Jess. You don't
want to hold things up!</i>

847
01:26:35,527 --> 01:26:39,564
Sweetheart, how do you feel today?

848
01:26:40,993 --> 01:26:44,103
I feel so good that I feel that
I could go into that Gillespie

849
01:26:44,128 --> 01:26:48,164
mine and take out every piece
of silver in it all by myself.

850
01:26:49,390 --> 01:26:51,927
<i>I just wouldn't have
believed that out of Wash.</i>

851
01:26:52,814 --> 01:26:56,179
<i>Maybe when I go back to clear out
Mama's things, I'll just go see him.</i>

852
01:26:56,204 --> 01:27:00,889
And I'll find out what happened.
- No, Janey, you don't need to do that.

853
01:27:02,038 --> 01:27:03,980
I think the boy showed
us what he's made of.

854
01:27:04,345 --> 01:27:08,481
Jess is right Jane. Let him alone.

855
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:12,183
I don't want anything from the
Gillespies but what I came here for in

856
01:27:12,208 --> 01:27:16,815
the first place. The silver.
- I'll get it for you.

857
01:27:17,785 --> 01:27:19,829
We'll find it. I promise.

858
01:27:20,036 --> 01:27:23,276
Only we'll go farther back.

859
01:27:23,615 --> 01:27:26,034
But it's dangerous back there.

860
01:27:26,059 --> 01:27:27,296
I know.

861
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:30,029
But it won't be.

862
01:27:30,934 --> 01:27:32,397
I can fix it.

863
01:27:32,716 --> 01:27:34,528
Come with me and I'll show you.

864
01:27:35,689 --> 01:27:36,689
Now.

865
01:27:37,299 --> 01:27:41,802
Every time I look at those walls, I
know there's gotta be more silver there.

866
01:27:43,188 --> 01:27:45,766
- Enough to make you rich.
- Ow!

867
01:27:45,931 --> 01:27:48,099
Kady, you alright?

868
01:27:48,550 --> 01:27:49,550
Kady.

869
01:27:59,179 --> 01:28:03,216
Jane can came out. Let's go further
back into the mine Jess. Come on!

870
01:28:41,189 --> 01:28:44,365
We just got four more here. You got it?

871
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:45,459
Yeah.

872
01:28:55,286 --> 01:28:56,416
It's the sheriff.

873
01:28:56,846 --> 01:28:58,515
Let's get those inside.

874
01:29:21,102 --> 01:29:22,102
Morning.

875
01:29:22,939 --> 01:29:25,994
What can I do for you?
- You Jess Tyler?

876
01:29:26,743 --> 01:29:29,510
That's right. I guard this mine.

877
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:33,036
Sometimes I go through it just to make
sure no scavengers been at it.

878
01:29:33,804 --> 01:29:34,804
Yes sir.

879
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:37,791
Which one of these girls is
your daughter?

880
01:29:40,872 --> 01:29:43,929
- Both. Why?
- Kady.

881
01:29:44,753 --> 01:29:45,753
I am.

882
01:29:46,625 --> 01:29:49,219
Mr. Tyler, I got a warrant
for your arrest here.

883
01:29:50,433 --> 01:29:52,434
One for Ms. Kady Tyler too.

884
01:29:53,318 --> 01:29:54,454
What for?

885
01:29:56,865 --> 01:29:57,915
Incest.

886
01:30:16,157 --> 01:30:19,785
I loaned my favorite rifle to Moke Blue
a day or two to go hunting with.

887
01:30:19,810 --> 01:30:24,696
He didn't bring it back. I went looking for
it. I thought maybe something might've

888
01:30:24,721 --> 01:30:27,620
happened to it. That's when I seen them.

889
01:30:27,687 --> 01:30:29,413
But they did not observe you?

890
01:30:29,438 --> 01:30:32,509
Oh no sir. I was keeping good
out of sight. I don't wanna

891
01:30:32,534 --> 01:30:36,515
get shot. Everybody knows how
Jess keeps to himself

892
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:39,774
on the job and don't want people around.

893
01:30:40,177 --> 01:30:46,203
After I see what they doing, I know why.
- Well, just what were they doing?

894
01:30:46,555 --> 01:30:49,685
Mr. Lamey.
- They were hugging and kissing.

895
01:30:49,889 --> 01:30:53,346
Hugging and kissing.

896
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:59,439
Many fathers and daughters, mothers and sons, show their
affections for each one another by hugging and kissing.

897
01:30:59,966 --> 01:31:01,817
Not like they's doing.

898
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:06,850
Just where did he touch her
with his hands Lamey?

899
01:31:07,388 --> 01:31:09,384
On her back...

900
01:31:09,719 --> 01:31:11,136
down to her...

901
01:31:11,214 --> 01:31:12,214
her butt.

902
01:31:12,844 --> 01:31:16,471
He put his hands up
under her skirt and rubbed.

903
01:31:19,644 --> 01:31:21,035
Tits too.

904
01:31:22,676 --> 01:31:27,073
How long did this go on?
- Three or four minutes maybe and then

905
01:31:27,098 --> 01:31:31,884
they went on back into the mine.
- Did you follow them then?

906
01:31:32,291 --> 01:31:35,422
No sir, I'd seen enough. After what
they was doing and

907
01:31:35,447 --> 01:31:37,698
I knowed what they was gonna do.

908
01:31:38,302 --> 01:31:40,746
That's all. Step down Mr. Lamey.

909
01:31:41,425 --> 01:31:42,542
Your honor.

910
01:31:43,138 --> 01:31:45,122
The peoples' concern here

911
01:31:45,706 --> 01:31:48,223
is more than just

912
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:53,690
the question of what point the warmth
of a father's kiss becomes a crime.

913
01:31:54,193 --> 01:31:58,229
It is a weakening of individual
morality

914
01:31:58,376 --> 01:32:01,828
or perhaps simply a slight
misunderstanding

915
01:32:01,853 --> 01:32:04,350
between God and Mr. Tyler,

916
01:32:04,842 --> 01:32:05,842
and yet

917
01:32:06,091 --> 01:32:08,848
there but for the grace of God

918
01:32:09,772 --> 01:32:13,513
goes every man or woman

919
01:32:14,221 --> 01:32:18,359
among us who has ever had an
incestual fantasy.

920
01:32:18,851 --> 01:32:22,643
Fantasizing is not a crime. It
is the act

921
01:32:22,843 --> 01:32:24,149
of incest

922
01:32:25,361 --> 01:32:30,578
that we are dealing with here
today which you must deal with now.

923
01:32:31,206 --> 01:32:32,430
Your honor.

924
01:32:39,136 --> 01:32:43,172
The wickedness of man is great
on the earth.

925
01:32:44,679 --> 01:32:52,218
And every imagination is the thoughts of
its hearts... is only evil continuing.

926
01:32:56,957 --> 01:32:58,759
The acts...

927
01:33:01,462 --> 01:33:03,334
the act to incest...

928
01:33:05,309 --> 01:33:07,855
Is there anyone in this
courtroom who doesn't

929
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:12,083
know what that means? Sexual relations

930
01:33:12,108 --> 01:33:15,879
between persons too closely
related by blood to be

931
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:20,274
entitled to marry. That's what it means.
Is there anyone in the whole Christian

932
01:33:20,299 --> 01:33:23,591
world that doesn't know it's a crime?

933
01:33:24,194 --> 01:33:25,667
Stand up, Tyler.

934
01:33:27,291 --> 01:33:28,948
You too young woman.

935
01:33:30,123 --> 01:33:33,290
The crime against nature,
shocking and repulsive

936
01:33:33,315 --> 01:33:38,893
to every basic sense of propriety,
decency, and good citizenship.

937
01:33:39,496 --> 01:33:41,214
If you're guilty Tyler

938
01:33:41,483 --> 01:33:44,138
the sentence for what
you've done is 10 in prison.

939
01:33:44,604 --> 01:33:45,876
What about her?

940
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:48,387
What about her indeed.

941
01:33:48,944 --> 01:33:54,213
If she went along with you... in this
filthiness, she's just as guilty as you are.

942
01:33:55,236 --> 01:33:58,219
After what I've heard in this
courtroom, Tyler, I'm holding you over

943
01:33:58,244 --> 01:34:02,684
charged with incest and she will stand trial
right along with you, depending of course

944
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:05,329
on how you plead.

945
01:34:06,576 --> 01:34:09,949
- Suppose I say I'm guilty.
- Are you?

946
01:34:10,424 --> 01:34:12,259
What happens if I say I am?

947
01:34:15,522 --> 01:34:18,833
I take your word for it and
send you to prison.

948
01:34:19,147 --> 01:34:21,969
- There would be no trial.
- No Tyler.

949
01:34:22,748 --> 01:34:26,188
Save the tax payers the money
and me the time, trouble and...

950
01:34:27,064 --> 01:34:29,291
spiritual disgust.

951
01:34:30,722 --> 01:34:35,552
And what happens...
if I say I... forced her?

952
01:34:39,689 --> 01:34:42,360
This is a nation under God.

953
01:34:42,778 --> 01:34:45,898
This is a good Christian community.

954
01:34:46,333 --> 01:34:47,750
If that...

955
01:34:48,411 --> 01:34:53,409
poor child been the object of
your unnatural lust.

956
01:34:53,864 --> 01:34:55,608
She's been punished enough

957
01:34:56,327 --> 01:34:59,213
and we put the criminals behind
bars, not the victims.

958
01:34:59,615 --> 01:35:02,996
Then she'd be free.
- That's what I told you.

959
01:35:05,148 --> 01:35:08,264
Then I'm guilty and I forced her.

960
01:35:12,321 --> 01:35:17,751
Ten years Tyler. Take him to jail.

961
01:35:22,057 --> 01:35:25,652
No! It's not true!

962
01:35:26,125 --> 01:35:28,431
He never forced me to do anything.

963
01:35:33,121 --> 01:35:34,358
Order! Order!

964
01:35:35,215 --> 01:35:37,728
Let's get some order in this court!

965
01:35:38,024 --> 01:35:40,295
You'll find yourselves out in
the street... all of you.

966
01:35:43,435 --> 01:35:45,038
You have any idea...

967
01:35:46,121 --> 01:35:47,315
what you just said.

968
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:49,950
Yes sir.

969
01:35:51,173 --> 01:35:55,507
He didn't do anything to me
that I didn't want to happen.

970
01:36:01,568 --> 01:36:03,353
Do you solemnly swear this...

971
01:36:03,685 --> 01:36:05,563
swear her in.

972
01:36:07,756 --> 01:36:10,083
He never forced me into anything.

973
01:36:10,578 --> 01:36:12,717
He's the gentlest man I've ever known.

974
01:36:13,532 --> 01:36:15,932
He ain't like any other man who is

975
01:36:16,165 --> 01:36:19,525
grabbing and taking what
they want and taking off.

976
01:36:22,121 --> 01:36:26,657
What we did was bound to happen...
from the first day we met.

977
01:36:27,594 --> 01:36:32,483
And when it did, it was good
for both of us.

978
01:36:34,879 --> 01:36:36,088
He's your...

979
01:36:36,818 --> 01:36:38,018
your father.

980
01:36:38,454 --> 01:36:39,971
And a good man.

981
01:36:41,624 --> 01:36:43,632
Best man I've ever known.

982
01:36:44,914 --> 01:36:46,121
He loves me.

983
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:50,061
And what you done is against the
law for a father and daughter.

984
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:52,909
But we wasn't like a
father and daughter.

985
01:36:53,233 --> 01:36:54,404
Not then.

986
01:36:54,938 --> 01:36:58,099
With God... it certainly wasn't.

987
01:36:59,209 --> 01:37:03,869
Did you two... stop to think for a minute if
what would happen if you would have a baby?

988
01:37:04,262 --> 01:37:08,779
We didn't plan to have no babies.
We were just a man and a woman.

989
01:37:09,761 --> 01:37:13,087
He wanted me... I wanted him

990
01:37:14,689 --> 01:37:16,112
and we loved each other.

991
01:37:20,881 --> 01:37:24,750
We don't want people like you walking
the streets with talk like that.

992
01:37:24,930 --> 01:37:27,005
You're going to reform school lady...

993
01:37:27,403 --> 01:37:29,304
and then 10 years in prison

994
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:33,969
and your child to state's custody to
see that he gets a decent upbringing.

995
01:37:38,033 --> 01:37:39,572
Your honor.

996
01:37:40,284 --> 01:37:43,366
She ain't done nothing wrong.
Me either.

997
01:37:44,222 --> 01:37:46,168
She's not my daughter. <i>- What!</i>

998
01:37:49,319 --> 01:37:50,922
Sit down and shut up!

999
01:37:50,947 --> 01:37:55,150
I had all I can take!

1000
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:58,300
Tyler!

1001
01:37:58,930 --> 01:38:00,900
Are you playing games with this court?

1002
01:38:01,926 --> 01:38:02,595
No sir.

1003
01:38:02,833 --> 01:38:06,938
If you're not this woman's
father... who is?

1004
01:38:11,131 --> 01:38:12,140
Moke Blue.

1005
01:38:13,457 --> 01:38:15,108
That's a lie!

1006
01:38:15,548 --> 01:38:18,579
I've never known you to lie before
Jess, but I don't want to hear that,

1007
01:38:18,604 --> 01:38:23,434
even if it is to protect me.
- No Kady, it's true.

1008
01:38:28,071 --> 01:38:31,425
Moke Blue... took up with my wife

1009
01:38:31,819 --> 01:38:34,584
Kady's mother. <i>- Who is now dead.</i>

1010
01:38:35,265 --> 01:38:36,001
Yes sir.

1011
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:38,133
It was about a year before Kady
was born.

1012
01:38:39,548 --> 01:38:43,551
It's kind of convenient for you
Tyler that she is dead.

1013
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:48,056
It leaves you free to tell the tale just how you
like it. What about Moke Blue? He sure could

1014
01:38:48,081 --> 01:38:49,941
throw some light on this.

1015
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:56,063
Your honor,
- Just a minute Norton. This man

1016
01:38:56,088 --> 01:39:00,324
is way out on a limb. I'm
interesting to see just where

1017
01:39:00,349 --> 01:39:04,620
he's going to saw it off. Tyler,

1018
01:39:06,558 --> 01:39:07,978
approach the bench.

1019
01:39:11,222 --> 01:39:14,127
Quiet here! Quiet!

1020
01:39:21,445 --> 01:39:25,648
- You aren't the girl's father?
- No sir.

1021
01:39:26,129 --> 01:39:27,564
What are you doing here?

1022
01:39:29,698 --> 01:39:35,143
If she surely isn't your daughter, then
why did you get yourself into this mess?

1023
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:39,082
All you had to do was tell her.

1024
01:39:41,831 --> 01:39:43,201
Why didn't you?

1025
01:39:47,342 --> 01:39:49,819
Because she really never had a father.

1026
01:39:50,743 --> 01:39:52,308
Not for 10 years.

1027
01:39:54,445 --> 01:39:56,125
And she needed that.

1028
01:40:00,737 --> 01:40:03,617
And... because

1029
01:40:06,291 --> 01:40:08,840
I wanted to be everything I could to you

1030
01:40:11,228 --> 01:40:12,701
because I love you.

1031
01:40:18,167 --> 01:40:19,554
Your honor, please!

1032
01:40:19,682 --> 01:40:22,768
I bet you Mr. Lamey can clear up any
question regarding this girl's parenting.

1033
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:26,909
Stay where you are Lamey.
I don't want anymore lies today.

1034
01:40:26,934 --> 01:40:28,059
Yes sir.

1035
01:40:28,351 --> 01:40:32,488
What do you know about this
girl's father, whoever he may be?

1036
01:40:32,987 --> 01:40:34,588
I know Moke ain't.

1037
01:40:35,307 --> 01:40:36,329
How do you know that?

1038
01:40:36,386 --> 01:40:38,158
Because he tells me everything.

1039
01:40:38,650 --> 01:40:40,201
Moke Blue is my brother.

1040
01:40:41,775 --> 01:40:44,521
He's my half brother, really.
We got the mom.

1041
01:40:44,606 --> 01:40:46,954
- Same mother?
- Yes sir.

1042
01:40:47,303 --> 01:40:51,262
She wasn't married when Moke come
along so he taken the Blue name.

1043
01:40:52,009 --> 01:40:56,112
Mama, she never been too proud of what she
done. So, we don't talk about it much.

1044
01:40:57,609 --> 01:41:00,994
Your honor.
- Oh can't anybody stay put?

1045
01:41:01,244 --> 01:41:03,014
I want you to look at this baby's belly.

1046
01:41:04,432 --> 01:41:06,229
Baby's belly?

1047
01:41:07,546 --> 01:41:09,208
He's got a red birth mark.

1048
01:41:10,570 --> 01:41:13,070
- A butterfly.
- A birthmark?

1049
01:41:13,095 --> 01:41:15,313
<i>Will you please listen to me?</i>

1050
01:41:16,453 --> 01:41:18,951
It's a marking that only the
boys in that family have.

1051
01:41:20,693 --> 01:41:27,344
If Ed Lamey and Moke Blue and her baby are related,
they'll have the same butterfly on his stomach.

1052
01:41:28,335 --> 01:41:31,184
Let the court see your stomach, Lamey,

1053
01:41:35,347 --> 01:41:37,210
Alright order!

1054
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:43,248
Order! Order! Norton, Norton...

1055
01:41:43,273 --> 01:41:46,306
is that a birthmark? Is it a...

1056
01:41:47,693 --> 01:41:52,130
- butterfly.
- Is it a butterfly?

1057
01:41:53,525 --> 01:41:56,005
It is a butterfly.

1058
01:41:59,758 --> 01:42:03,827
Well, I...
Just one more little question.

1059
01:42:05,558 --> 01:42:07,746
If Moke Blue is her father,

1060
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:12,724
why the hell didn't he tell her?!

1061
01:42:12,916 --> 01:42:16,775
The silver. Silver? Yeah.

1062
01:42:16,942 --> 01:42:20,971
Gillespie silver. Moke was sure
that after the wedding, when he

1063
01:42:20,996 --> 01:42:25,434
come out and admitted that Kady was his daughter,
that they'd come across with something.

1064
01:42:30,704 --> 01:42:32,992
Case is dismissed.

1065
01:42:40,015 --> 01:42:42,043
Wash!

1066
01:42:59,752 --> 01:43:03,082
I didn't leave you. I'd never
leave you.

1067
01:43:05,508 --> 01:43:08,094
Your father told my parents and
he said that I wasn't the father.

1068
01:43:08,119 --> 01:43:11,442
He said Moke Blue was the father.

1069
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:01,374
You don't love him.

1070
01:44:04,234 --> 01:44:06,596
Not the same way I love you.

1071
01:44:08,940 --> 01:44:13,841
But he can give Danny everything
he needs... or wants.

1072
01:44:15,227 --> 01:44:16,227
And me

1073
01:44:19,062 --> 01:44:20,493
will make it right.

1074
01:44:26,403 --> 01:44:28,038
I don't want to lose you.

1075
01:44:29,390 --> 01:44:33,840
Jess, you'll never lose me.

1076
01:44:35,303 --> 01:44:37,747
You're my daddy.

1077
01:44:43,251 --> 01:44:46,544
And you'll always be my daddy.

1078
01:44:47,348 --> 01:44:48,687
Always.
