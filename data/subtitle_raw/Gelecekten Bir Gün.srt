1
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:56,537
Tolga! Tolga!

2
00:00:58,427 --> 00:01:00,145
Tolga man! Get up! It's 7.30 already.

3
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,103
Hnnn...

4
00:01:01,787 --> 00:01:03,061
C'mon man. Get up!

5
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:16,859
If you really put your mint to it,
you can wake early the next day.

6
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:21,336
That was the 9 o' clock news.
We hope to see you again at 10.

7
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,976
What have you done, man?
It's already late.

8
00:01:24,107 --> 00:01:26,098
What can I do? It said 7.30.

9
00:01:26,347 --> 00:01:27,496
C'mon, move, man.

10
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:33,540
The projects I did before were
always ignored because of that guy Salim.

11
00:01:33,587 --> 00:01:35,232
Now for the first
time an opportunity to...

12
00:01:35,267 --> 00:01:36,985
...make a presentation to
the big boss happens...

13
00:01:37,027 --> 00:01:38,824
and I'm late for that too.
Is it possible?

14
00:01:39,587 --> 00:01:41,339
Excuse me, where's the Galata tower?

15
00:01:41,507 --> 00:01:43,384
Ask someone else, you maniac.

16
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:45,465
C'mon I can't waste time on you.

17
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:51,707
Come here you. Come here. Animal.

18
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:53,060
That guy was a Turk.

19
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:54,382
Shall I tell you something?

20
00:01:54,427 --> 00:01:56,418
With this luck we'll be
caught on the bridge.

21
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:57,866
Don't be ridiculous.
Are you busy?

22
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:01,463
Get in.

23
00:02:03,027 --> 00:02:04,824
Oh man. We should've
turned right there.

24
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:05,697
We missed the turning.

25
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,855
We'll have to go round now.

26
00:02:08,707 --> 00:02:10,265
Don't cut in. Idiot.

27
00:02:11,107 --> 00:02:14,417
Don't stop. Don't you understand.
For God's sake.

28
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,695
Let's get on with it.
We're in a hurry.

29
00:02:15,747 --> 00:02:16,862
Wait. Stop. Don't man.
What's he doing?

30
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:18,096
Hey man. Just leave it.

31
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:20,582
C'mon. Let's go...

32
00:02:23,147 --> 00:02:25,712
Oh man I've dropped
the flash disc.

33
00:02:25,747 --> 00:02:28,341
My presentation is on it.
My life is on that disc.

34
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:29,502
Tolga, where've you dropped it?

35
00:02:29,547 --> 00:02:30,741
I don't know, man.
I hope it's at home. Damn.

36
00:02:31,307 --> 00:02:35,346
One of my girls has got one. Let's go
back and get it if you want. T'S 4 GB too.

37
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:37,424
Turn just here man. Turn.

38
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:47,419
Got it, found it. What happened man?
Where's the taxi?

39
00:02:49,547 --> 00:02:50,644
The taxi? He's running
on a meter. It reached...

40
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:51,742
...10 lira. I paid him
and sent him on his way.

41
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:52,903
What are we gonna do?
Hhhh.

42
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:54,217
C'mon. Move.

43
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:12,375
There you go. Perfect. Just my luck.
I've told you before.

44
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:14,827
No luck. I just have that
kind of luck. Whatever I do...

45
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,022
...born unlucky. Oh for
chrissakes. Damn it, shit!

46
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:23,945
Give me my pass.
Take it.

47
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:29,224
You see it's my luck, man.
Everything in my life's like that.

48
00:03:29,787 --> 00:03:32,267
You go... go and be in love
with the boss's daughter...

49
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:34,735
...as if there isn't
another girl in the world.

50
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:36,586
Haven't you been eyeing her up, man?

51
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:45,665
No, my son. I mean, in fact... At the
company we looked at each other, that's all.

52
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:51,741
One time she smiled. She
may just've been eyeing me...

53
00:03:51,787 --> 00:03:55,541
...up secretly. I can't be sure.
Maybe she was just looking.

54
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,746
We can't really call that chance.
It's something else completely.

55
00:03:59,147 --> 00:04:03,026
Even the team I support is in the amateur
league now. 'Sthat seem familiar to you?

56
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:10,302
You've really lost it man.
Look at me You haven't woken up yet.

57
00:04:10,547 --> 00:04:11,980
When we get off, go and wash
your face and get it together.

58
00:04:12,027 --> 00:04:14,382
If you want to beat your run
of bad luck it's in your hands.

59
00:04:14,747 --> 00:04:19,227
Do your gig to the boss and win him over.
You said Ebru will be there.

60
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:21,457
Break your run of bad luck man, break it.

61
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,022
Tolga.

62
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:31,817
Tolga.

63
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:34,377
Give me that!

64
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:35,661
Hayati my man.
How're you doing?

65
00:04:37,107 --> 00:04:40,736
On the way to the man, I said go and wash
your face and he flew into the sea.

66
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:41,776
Haha. Very funny.

67
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:42,903
Quickly.

68
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:43,777
What?

69
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:47,965
Tolga.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,783
What?

71
00:04:49,227 --> 00:04:50,455
Salim's calling.

72
00:04:51,267 --> 00:04:55,943
What's that psycho got to do with me?
Here, take it. You speak.

73
00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:57,659
I dropped my phone in the sea.

74
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:03,740
Hello, Mr. Salim. Excuse me.
Excuse me. I'm a bit late...

75
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:07,143
Can't you see the sign? Rude boy.
Who d'you think you are?

76
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,345
And you educated 'n' all.

77
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:10,696
If you can't think for yourself,
think of others.

78
00:05:10,747 --> 00:05:12,180
You'll see.

79
00:05:12,227 --> 00:05:16,015
Hey man, can't you see the sign? It's
forbidden to speak on the 'phone.

80
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,872
Mr. Salim. Sir, I'm on the
bus right now...

81
00:05:18,907 --> 00:05:23,059
and it's forbidden to speak here, so you
speak and I will listen, sir.

82
00:05:24,227 --> 00:05:26,900
Driver. I'll get off the bus
at a convenient spot.

83
00:05:30,827 --> 00:05:32,818
It couldn't have been more
convenient, in fact.

84
00:05:36,547 --> 00:05:37,866
Is this the last stop?

85
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:40,425
This is the last stop for everyone.

86
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:48,616
We're not too late, are we?

87
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:49,861
Mr. Salim will kill me.

88
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:55,097
OK man, see you later.
Take it easy. Good luck.

89
00:05:55,747 --> 00:05:56,975
- You too man.
- See you.

90
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:01,583
Enter.

91
00:06:03,987 --> 00:06:04,817
Enter.

92
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:10,100
Tolga, what do you think we do here?

93
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:11,341
Salim, good morning.

94
00:06:11,387 --> 00:06:13,378
Everyone's waiting for you,
where've you been?

95
00:06:13,427 --> 00:06:14,303
A small thing happened on the...

96
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:17,020
What do you think you're wearing?
And why don't you answer the phone?

97
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:18,739
My phone, well, it fell into the sea.

98
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:20,257
Where's your presentation?

99
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:25,100
It fell in too
and everything got wet but

100
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:28,857
but I've got a flash disk.
I hope it will work.

101
00:06:29,947 --> 00:06:30,743
Will it?

102
00:06:31,987 --> 00:06:32,817
Let me look, give it here.

103
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:35,502
You go to the conference room

104
00:06:35,547 --> 00:06:37,697
check the preparation, see if there's
anything you need.

105
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:41,137
After the meeting drop by here, you
need to sign a few documents.

106
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:42,063
OK, sir.

107
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:46,147
C'mon, what are you waiting for?
Quickly. Move.

108
00:06:46,182 --> 00:06:47,785
Standing there like a lemon.

109
00:06:58,787 --> 00:06:59,617
Everything OK?

110
00:06:59,907 --> 00:07:01,101
I don't think there's a problem.

111
00:07:01,147 --> 00:07:02,136
Thanks.

112
00:07:25,347 --> 00:07:26,257
OK, let's start, please.

113
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:27,262
Of course, sir.

114
00:07:31,547 --> 00:07:32,827
First of all welcome to everyone.

115
00:07:32,862 --> 00:07:34,465
Err. The Alacity Project.

116
00:07:38,827 --> 00:07:41,625
Petrol has been found in various
areas of Turkey,

117
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:45,057
mostly in the South Eastern region
and there is some production there.

118
00:07:45,107 --> 00:07:48,383
The South Eastern region.
Batman. Mardin.

119
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:51,342
Let's keep it short please.
Make it clear.

120
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:54,457
Right away. One second.

121
00:07:55,867 --> 00:08:02,136
The petrol reserves in the Aegean region
according to my research in the area.

122
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:08,664
I focussed on the Alacity vicinity.
Excue me I'm a bit nervous- err

123
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:10,057
moving on swiftly -

124
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:17,265
if we, as a company,
invest in this region...

125
00:08:32,627 --> 00:08:34,743
err - the Alacity region -

126
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:40,786
err -while I was coming here
I dropped my flash disk in the sea.

127
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:43,625
I don't know how these
changes happened - err.

128
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:50,940
Here's something the region's best - err
- where's this come from?

129
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:58,163
Now, Mr Salim, you know,
there's real potential in...

130
00:08:58,198 --> 00:09:02,459
...this Alacity region and
there is serious proof...

131
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:09,857
One second. This is Alacity but
where've these come from?

132
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:14,375
Now, Mr. Salim, Alacity,

133
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:23,312
Mr. Salim, you know
that the Alacity region...

134
00:09:23,347 --> 00:09:26,464
...has been well researched
and there are details...

135
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:41,142
Mr. Timur, the final contracts.

136
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:45,147
I can't tell you how
sorry I am about wasting...

137
00:09:45,182 --> 00:09:47,138
...your precious time
this morning sir.

138
00:09:47,747 --> 00:09:50,898
I shouldn't have trusted that boy
to make a presentation to you.

139
00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:54,147
With your permission I'd like
to speak to the accountant...

140
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:56,263
...and secure that young
man's formal notice.

141
00:09:56,827 --> 00:09:59,421
Don't you think deciding to throw
that young man out is a bit heavy?

142
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:05,258
Mr. Timur, sir, in business life this
sort of thing is intolerable.

143
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:09,147
I don't really think it's a good idea but
that youth is just at the beginning.

144
00:10:09,182 --> 00:10:10,398
For young people to learn,
sometimes it's better...

145
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:11,615
...to make difficult decisions,
for their own good.

146
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:26,017
Take it easy.

147
00:10:33,387 --> 00:10:34,217
Tolga.

148
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:38,226
Tolga, ah Tolga. I can't tell you
how sorry I am.

149
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:39,461
You didn't deserve this.

150
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:44,506
I really tried to keep you but the boss...
Now what will you do?

151
00:10:45,107 --> 00:10:47,827
Sometimes this is what happens
in business life. I hope...

152
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:50,500
...from now on things will
go how you want them to.

153
00:10:52,227 --> 00:10:54,387
Oh. Tolga, before you
got drop by for a moment...

154
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:56,537
...I need you to sign a
few papers for me.

155
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:44,992
Meto, my man, when you read
this I will be far away.

156
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:50,147
If I can't succeed at yet another
bit of bad luck, very far away.

157
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:56,067
I have no hope left even for
my big, secret love. Damn my...

158
00:11:56,102 --> 00:12:00,345
...bad luck, living with bad
luck I prefer not to live.

159
00:12:02,147 --> 00:12:04,103
Damn my bad luck.

160
00:12:04,907 --> 00:12:07,296
Damn my bad luck!

161
00:12:44,187 --> 00:12:45,540
Good jump huh!

162
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:55,221
Wow. So it's like this.

163
00:13:03,427 --> 00:13:06,032
Hi. The Gates ha.

164
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:14,065
No, no, no. Entry procedure. The situation
and friends are a bit different there.

165
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:21,027
Actually, there's no reason for formality.
I mean I should go straight to hell.

166
00:13:21,062 --> 00:13:24,906
After such an unfortunate life
I'm not expecting anything else actually.

167
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:27,897
What a supercool guy you are.

168
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:30,497
Hm. What?

169
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:34,032
Look human. D'you know
what your real problem is?

170
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:38,067
You put all your responsiblity in
the hands of chance and fate.

171
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:39,872
You learn nothing.
You don't fight it.

172
00:13:39,907 --> 00:13:43,456
You don't take the responsibility for
anythinga dn immediately leave it to God.

173
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:47,147
At a time like this mutiny
in the face of destiny...

174
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:48,552
...might be good, don't you think?

175
00:13:48,587 --> 00:13:52,027
Mutiny? In this case,
which I've never been in...

176
00:13:52,062 --> 00:13:55,472
...I don't know where
to put myself.

177
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:58,627
With my help. I'm concerned
with things of the world.

178
00:13:58,662 --> 00:14:01,983
D'you know what
I've lived with all my life?

179
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:05,699
Did I fail your registration?
I'm the registrar.

180
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:11,138
Look. This was the
first time I fell in love.

181
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:18,347
What happened to me? Bad luck, wasn't it?
My presentation, my getting fired,

182
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:21,862
making a fool of myself in
front of the girl and once...

183
00:14:21,897 --> 00:14:25,342
...again being able to see
her. What was all that then?

184
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,272
Look, in time
you will find out.

185
00:14:29,307 --> 00:14:35,147
What's the point of throwing yourself
of a skyscraper? What's that, man?

186
00:14:35,182 --> 00:14:36,660
Could you have
lived with that life?

187
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:45,667
OK. If you'd lived d'you
know what would've happened?

188
00:14:45,702 --> 00:14:49,112
If only you knew what you missed.

189
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:53,186
OK. So now I should be
sorry about that then?

190
00:14:53,867 --> 00:14:59,863
O, forget it. I prefer to hand myself over to
this than going on living that unlucky life.

191
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:04,047
Nope, this guy doesn't get it.
He doesn't.

192
00:15:04,082 --> 00:15:07,712
D'you know what the
best punishment could be?

193
00:15:07,747 --> 00:15:12,502
Showing you where you could've
been in five years time.

194
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:18,586
If you can do that, bring it on.

195
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:23,706
Bring it on he says.
O God. My god.

196
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:30,466
Just one day from morning to night.
Then you come back here at midnight.

197
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:36,552
But don't tell anyone
our little secret.

198
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:40,827
The minute you do you
come back here right away.

199
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:42,146
Ok.

200
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:43,937
Will you beam me down?

201
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:47,580
O, for Chrissakes!

202
00:16:03,987 --> 00:16:04,817
Hello sir.

203
00:16:05,347 --> 00:16:06,223
Welcome sir.

204
00:16:08,627 --> 00:16:09,457
Welcome sir.

205
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:11,823
Good morning.

206
00:16:12,627 --> 00:16:14,185
Good morning sir.

207
00:17:13,587 --> 00:17:15,976
Where've you been man?
I've been looking for you all morning.

208
00:17:17,267 --> 00:17:18,063
Meto.

209
00:17:18,147 --> 00:17:20,112
It's incredible that
on a busy day like...

210
00:17:20,147 --> 00:17:22,342
...today you're not to be
found anywhere, Tolga.

211
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:28,536
We've got tons of stuff to do. Even
your secretary has come to me for help.

212
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:32,860
How you think you can manage I don't know.
C'mon then let's get on with it.

213
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,222
C'mon man. Still here? Move.

214
00:17:55,827 --> 00:17:56,907
Take it easy.

215
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:57,737
Thanks.

216
00:17:58,707 --> 00:18:00,106
Welcome, Mr. Tolga.

217
00:18:00,467 --> 00:18:03,379
Ruya, let's get on with it.
We're all a bit tense today.

218
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,945
Here's your programme for today.

219
00:18:30,747 --> 00:18:34,820
First I postponed your holographic
conference with the Australians.

220
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:40,136
That's great.

221
00:18:43,547 --> 00:18:46,459
The president wanted to see
you and is waiting for you to call.

222
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:47,937
Who?

223
00:18:47,987 --> 00:18:48,817
The president.

224
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:53,112
The president.
With me?

225
00:18:53,147 --> 00:18:55,502
Tolga. I can't get involved in that. Enough.

226
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:00,256
Let's postpone that too.

227
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:08,379
The financial director is stil waiting for
your approval of the new payments.

228
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:12,126
UNESCO want to give you
an award for your most...

229
00:19:12,161 --> 00:19:15,105
...recent charitable
contribution and await a date.

230
00:19:17,147 --> 00:19:18,421
That's for tomorrow too.

231
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:25,742
I don't need to remind you that it's
your wife's birthday party this evening.

232
00:19:26,427 --> 00:19:29,507
And your father-in-law, Mr. Timur is
waiting for news from you about lunch.

233
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:31,463
My wife and my father-in-law.

234
00:19:33,947 --> 00:19:34,777
That's all for today.

235
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,542
Have a nice day, sir.

236
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:56,704
Man, this, man.

237
00:20:08,027 --> 00:20:08,903
Tolga, are you OK?

238
00:20:10,787 --> 00:20:11,617
I'm fine, fine.

239
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:19,336
Have a look at this.

240
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:23,502
This is last week's.

241
00:20:25,987 --> 00:20:26,817
And this.

242
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:30,901
This is the other day.

243
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:39,507
This really is a strange day for me.

244
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:42,547
Seems like I've forgotten everything.

245
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:44,312
Let's go and see a doctor.

246
00:20:44,347 --> 00:20:48,818
No, no. I'm saying, look at what
we've been through recently.

247
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:56,865
Recently - meaning? We won
last month's tender for land.

248
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:01,540
Then we opened a second oil well.

249
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:04,705
We went together why d'you ask me that?

250
00:21:05,987 --> 00:21:08,167
Petrol. I knew that.

251
00:21:08,202 --> 00:21:10,312
What did you know?

252
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:17,458
Ha, forget it. Look. Look.
What if we talk about life a bit.

253
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:21,827
Oh. You wanted me to find
a ticket for the European...

254
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:25,227
...final and your brother
got the best box for you.

255
00:21:25,262 --> 00:21:26,660
No, not things like that man.

256
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:32,507
What did you say?
The European final?

257
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:33,656
The Championship League.

258
00:21:33,707 --> 00:21:34,587
The final?

259
00:21:34,622 --> 00:21:35,417
Yes.

260
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,420
Oh! Talk about me a little.

261
00:21:45,787 --> 00:21:49,564
Man, for god's sake, what are you saying?
What d'you want to know?

262
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,341
I mean the last three to five years-
tell me that, how'd I get here?

263
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:56,223
Oooh.

264
00:21:57,987 --> 00:22:04,825
I mean, Ebru, me, our kids, our marriage,
how'd that happen?

265
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:07,352
Give me a summary.

266
00:22:07,387 --> 00:22:11,665
Man, you haven't been well since
this morning. Let's go to the doctor.

267
00:22:13,547 --> 00:22:16,141
I'm exhausted.

268
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:28,106
D'you know Tolga, I never had the
slightest doubt about you.

269
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:36,416
It brings me great satisfaction that we've
come to this point and I wasn't wrong.

270
00:22:37,587 --> 00:22:38,417
Thank you, sir.

271
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:45,427
By the way, are all the preparations
for Ebru's birthday party ready?

272
00:22:45,462 --> 00:22:46,826
Birthday party?

273
00:22:47,587 --> 00:22:49,305
Of course, of course.
Ready? Everything's ready.

274
00:22:51,227 --> 00:22:55,300
It makes me very happy to see my daughter
and my grandchildren so happy.

275
00:22:56,867 --> 00:22:58,505
God never gave me a boy but...

276
00:22:58,747 --> 00:23:01,312
Hold on. Don't rebel!

277
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:03,736
No, no. That's not what I wanted to say.

278
00:23:05,107 --> 00:23:11,216
God didn't give me a boy but he gave me
a son-in-law like you. So I'm blessed.

279
00:23:11,707 --> 00:23:13,823
Thank you, sir. Go on just like that.

280
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:15,497
Excuse me?

281
00:23:18,507 --> 00:23:21,738
I mean, to feel blessed is nice,
to give thanks.

282
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:26,178
I'm going to wash my hands,
you get the bill.

283
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:31,502
Excuse me sir, what did you want?

284
00:23:32,227 --> 00:23:33,267
I just wanted the bill.

285
00:23:33,302 --> 00:23:34,177
Of course sir.

286
00:23:36,347 --> 00:23:37,177
There you are.

287
00:23:38,867 --> 00:23:40,507
Your retina payment has been approved.

288
00:23:40,542 --> 00:23:41,499
What's that then?

289
00:23:41,534 --> 00:23:42,456
Thank you, sir.

290
00:23:45,707 --> 00:23:49,586
If Turkey has become the
third largest economy in...

291
00:23:49,621 --> 00:23:53,466
...the world, it's not
because of the government

292
00:23:53,507 --> 00:23:56,305
but more to do with our debt to the success
of the Alacity and Adana projects.

293
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:58,472
Those are reckoned to
be among the best...

294
00:23:58,507 --> 00:24:00,632
...quality and richest petrol
reserves in the world.

295
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:03,387
Of course. Turkey's destiny changed
because of those oil reserves.

296
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:05,552
Is it easy to become a major
world force overnight?

297
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:08,947
But I don't think we should belittle
what the government has done.

298
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:11,027
The problem in the South
East has finished, inflation...

299
00:24:11,062 --> 00:24:12,944
...wiped out, unemployment
around the zero mark.

300
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:14,827
Our president showed
great leadership over our...

301
00:24:14,862 --> 00:24:15,632
...petrol reserves
at the G-9 summit.

302
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,967
...the G-9 summit is another thing...
- G-9. Phew!

303
00:24:18,002 --> 00:24:20,232
But if our president hadn't
stopped the other eight...

304
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:23,147
...countries and we say if it wasn't
easy to get to this point now...

305
00:24:23,182 --> 00:24:26,507
And now we join our sports
service for the sports news.

306
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:28,952
Because today is an important
day in football,

307
00:24:28,987 --> 00:24:31,867
- after our national football team.
- Following the World Cup championship.

308
00:24:31,902 --> 00:24:33,112
World Cup?

309
00:24:33,147 --> 00:24:35,792
The eyes of world football are
focussed on two teams in...

310
00:24:35,827 --> 00:24:40,705
the League Championship match between
Galatasaray and Fenerbahce.

311
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,584
Whoa! It's really true. Man, I wonder what
happened to my poor team?

312
00:24:46,907 --> 00:24:49,427
Everyone left the amateur league. Only
they remained. They won't get out.

313
00:24:49,462 --> 00:24:53,739
They're shutting down the
third amateur league.

314
00:24:56,507 --> 00:24:57,576
How's it going, bud?

315
00:24:58,107 --> 00:24:59,460
You? What are you doing here?

316
00:25:00,907 --> 00:25:02,340
I brought a message from the chief
angel and thought I'd take a look.

317
00:25:03,387 --> 00:25:06,345
You were trying to get
information from people.

318
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:08,337
I suggest you don't go there.

319
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:11,945
What can I do? Hey man. It's not that.
Everything's turned upside down.

320
00:25:13,147 --> 00:25:16,264
What am I gonna do at home?

321
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:17,856
You mean when you see Ebru?

322
00:25:18,827 --> 00:25:19,816
Yea.

323
00:25:21,067 --> 00:25:26,141
That's your problem. You've
got til midnight. Use your time well.

324
00:25:26,947 --> 00:25:27,823
Cinderella.

325
00:25:28,787 --> 00:25:29,981
Help me just a bit.

326
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:31,343
Bye bud.

327
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:39,777
Asistan angel. Look. What was I gonna say?
Are you on overtime?

328
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:43,940
Do they insure you up there? It's amazing.
There you go. Work from nine to five and...

329
00:25:45,947 --> 00:25:48,415
What's that?
Are you talking to a genie?

330
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:50,461
Come on. Shall we go?

331
00:26:03,347 --> 00:26:04,227
Fine, see you this evening.

332
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,455
See you later, sir.

333
00:26:31,907 --> 00:26:32,703
Here you are, sir.

334
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:34,143
Excuse me?

335
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:35,747
Are you alright, sir?

336
00:26:35,782 --> 00:26:36,862
I'm fine.

337
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:38,497
Will you get in?

338
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,223
Get in?

339
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:42,261
Do you want to drive again today, sir?

340
00:26:43,547 --> 00:26:44,423
Really?

341
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:45,497
Sir?

342
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:52,143
There's probably a lot of traffic,
no, you drive, you...

343
00:27:01,507 --> 00:27:02,383
Where are we going, sir?

344
00:27:09,387 --> 00:27:16,707
Straight on. Straight home, I mean.
My wife, my kids, my home.

345
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:18,106
Where else?

346
00:27:23,947 --> 00:27:24,936
I want to ask you something.

347
00:27:25,587 --> 00:27:26,417
Yes, sir.

348
00:27:27,827 --> 00:27:28,961
What am I like?

349
00:27:28,996 --> 00:27:30,095
A good man, sir.

350
00:27:32,507 --> 00:27:35,583
You're just saying that,
because I'm the boss. But I'm...

351
00:27:35,618 --> 00:27:38,659
...really asking. Forget about
all that driver boss stuff.

352
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:40,939
As a plain man I'm asking. What am I like?
I won't be angry, really.

353
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:46,016
In as far as I know,
you are a normal man, sir.

354
00:27:47,187 --> 00:27:50,657
As a father, a husband.
I'm a good man.

355
00:27:51,507 --> 00:27:52,860
God bless you sir, a good man.

356
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:54,866
A good man, a good man.

357
00:27:56,707 --> 00:28:00,912
Excuse me. I mean as a
man what do I do outside?

358
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:05,192
What do I drink? Eat? What
am I like? Give me a clue?

359
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:08,507
Are you feeling unwell sir if you like

My girl.

368
00:29:06,827 --> 00:29:09,107

369
00:29:09,142 --> 00:29:11,712

00:29:18,587 --> 00:29:23,866
Dad? How did you meet mummy?

374
00:29:24,707 --> 00:29:28,859
Your mummy. We used to do
the same things that's how we met.

375
00:29:30,147 --> 00:29:31,375
Then?

376
00:29:32,227 --> 00:29:38,621
Then? We saw each other and fell in
love and got married.

377
00:29:39,667 --> 00:29:42,386
Have you forgotten?

378
00:29:43,947 --> 00:29:45,744

00:30:31,947 --> 00:30:34,222
Hi, how's it going?

384
00:30:34,507 --> 00:30:39,027
Everything's ready. Were just waiting
for the catering company to come.

385
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:40,016
OK, that's fine. Let me
know when they arrive.

386
00:30:50,987 --> 00:30:54,582
Aha, my darling. How are you?

387
00:30:57,347 --> 00:30:59,907
Fantastic. My love.

388
00:31:00,787 --> 00:31:02,140
How's my hair?

389
00:31:02,747 --> 00:31:03,552
Lovely.

390
00:31:03,587 --> 00:31:07,312
I wonder if I'd put it up would it
have been better?

391
00:31:07,347 --> 00:31:15,067
Up? That would've been lovely too.
That way's lovely too.

392
00:31:15,102 --> 00:31:16,102
Liar.

393
00:31:16,137 --> 00:31:17,102
Truly.

394
00:31:17,707 --> 00:31:20,460
D'you want to see the dress
I've got for this evening?

395
00:31:21,907 --> 00:31:22,737
OK.

396
00:31:22,787 --> 00:31:23,663
C'mon then.

397
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:31,065
Hold on a minute darling.

398
00:31:32,907 --> 00:31:34,863
As soon as i saw it in the
window i said that's the one.

399
00:31:36,147 --> 00:31:37,660
Look dyou like it?

400
00:31:40,427 --> 00:31:41,257
What d'you think?

401
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,376
It's lovely but...

402
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:45,857
But?

403
00:31:45,907 --> 00:31:47,712
I want to see it on you.

404
00:31:47,747 --> 00:31:50,387
Youll have to wait til this
evening for that my darling.

405
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:54,858
This evening? I want to tell
you someting. Listen.

406
00:31:56,107 --> 00:32:01,465
Sometimes we don't have ot
wait til the evening right?

407
00:32:01,507 --> 00:32:04,147
D'you want to do
something naughty?

408
00:32:04,182 --> 00:32:06,615
Naughty? Maybe...

409
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,900
I think you must
wait until tonight.

410
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:10,657
But why?

411
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:13,707
I want you to be impatient.

412
00:32:13,742 --> 00:32:14,856
What for?

413
00:32:15,427 --> 00:32:17,145
Because I do. OK.

414
00:32:17,987 --> 00:32:18,897
No, it's not.

415
00:32:19,747 --> 00:32:23,296
Darling, Is there anything wrong?

416
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:24,897
Yes.

417
00:32:25,907 --> 00:32:28,421
Ma'am, the catering company's
arrived and you wanted me to tell you.

418
00:32:28,827 --> 00:32:29,896
OK. I'm coming.

419
00:32:30,787 --> 00:32:31,697
They're waiting downstairs.

420
00:32:32,347 --> 00:32:33,496
OK. I'm coming now.

421
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:38,746
Darling. Let go. I have to go downstairs.

422
00:32:40,307 --> 00:32:42,616
Unfortunately.
Darling.

423
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:54,632
Many happy returns
of the day. Like 1001 nights.

424
00:33:54,667 --> 00:34:00,902
Are you ready for a wonderful holiday?
Here are your reservations.

425
00:34:03,947 --> 00:34:08,179
Baghdad. Thank you very much.

426
00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:10,257
Darling.

427
00:34:11,587 --> 00:34:14,260
Happy birthday my darling daughter.

428
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:18,827
Thank you for everything!

429
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:25,147
This is from me.
A 1960 Mustang.

430
00:34:25,182 --> 00:34:26,626
I don't believe it.

431
00:34:31,307 --> 00:34:32,740
My dearest here you are.

432
00:34:33,827 --> 00:34:34,657
I'm really nervous.

433
00:34:34,707 --> 00:34:35,537
Son-in-law.

434
00:34:38,147 --> 00:34:42,823
I think it's my turn.
Happy birthday darling.

435
00:34:47,907 --> 00:34:53,592
Darling, wasn't this Granny's necklace?

436
00:34:53,627 --> 00:35:00,863
Yes it was. Her favourite one.
She had to sell it during the war.

437
00:35:01,907 --> 00:35:05,967
We saw it in an auction
catalogue recently.

438
00:35:06,002 --> 00:35:10,027
Tolga wanted to do this
as a surprise for you.

439
00:35:10,062 --> 00:35:10,992
Me?

440
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:13,307
Darling I cant believe
you. You cant possibly...

441
00:35:13,342 --> 00:35:15,537
...know how important
this is for me.

442
00:35:16,387 --> 00:35:18,622
This necklace was very
important for Granny and...

443
00:35:18,657 --> 00:35:20,857
...she always wanted it
to stay in the family.

444
00:35:23,587 --> 00:35:24,861
Darling. You're wonderful.

445
00:35:27,307 --> 00:35:28,535
Thank you very much.

446
00:35:30,707 --> 00:35:33,665
Before my grandmother died
she spoke to me and said:

447
00:35:39,507 --> 00:35:42,419
Everybody creates their own luck.

448
00:35:43,787 --> 00:35:48,463
Your luck will be that you find a man
who loves you very mcuh.

449
00:35:48,907 --> 00:35:53,378
She said: One day when you feel like you're
the luckiest woman in the world

450
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:58,342
...you will, in fact, have met the
man you were looking for.

451
00:36:08,947 --> 00:36:09,743
Come with me.

452
00:36:10,827 --> 00:36:11,737
Where?

453
00:36:13,027 --> 00:36:13,982
Nothings gonna happen. Come.

454
00:36:14,307 --> 00:36:15,422
What?

455
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:16,263
Come on.

456
00:36:23,187 --> 00:36:28,739
Ohh. It's lovely.
It's beautiful, isn't it?

457
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,300
Yes, yes. Lovely.
Come on.

458
00:36:30,947 --> 00:36:32,778
What come on?
Aren't we going to look inside?

459
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:35,341
At this time? In the dark? No way.

460
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,937
Come on.

461
00:36:37,147 --> 00:36:39,072
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

462
00:36:39,107 --> 00:36:41,302
You said the evening.
What are you waiting for?

463
00:36:41,347 --> 00:36:44,544
When i said evening i meant later?

464
00:36:44,587 --> 00:36:46,179
O, don't do that.

465
00:36:47,427 --> 00:36:50,021
Darling are you mad?
With all these people?

466
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:54,060
What will happen?
Now we're out of the crowd.

467
00:36:54,107 --> 00:36:55,062
Ye-e-s.

468
00:36:55,107 --> 00:36:57,701
And weve got this
opportunity to go upstairs.

469
00:36:58,387 --> 00:37:02,067
You've gone mad baby. When
there are so many people outside.

470
00:37:02,102 --> 00:37:04,376
So? Guests. Today is today
and tomorrow is tomorrow.

471
00:37:04,427 --> 00:37:08,978
We are all guests in this world arent we?
Here today gone tomorrow. I think so anyway.

472
00:37:09,867 --> 00:37:13,337
Why cant you wait? Why now?
Cant you wait another hour or two?

473
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:15,937
I cant wait.

474
00:37:15,987 --> 00:37:16,863
Why?

475
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:24,456
I cant wait. Don't ask why. Isnt this
more exciting? While there are guests.

476
00:37:24,507 --> 00:37:26,657
Cold weather. We go to
the bedroom. Inside.

477
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:28,543
I don't know.

478
00:37:30,227 --> 00:37:32,582
You got me.
I'll take the keys.

479
00:37:37,427 --> 00:37:38,303
What are you saying?

480
00:37:41,707 --> 00:37:42,742
Slowly, wait.

481
00:37:45,787 --> 00:37:46,617
My love, wait.

482
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:50,546
Hurry up. Nobody will notice,
don't worry.

483
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:53,785
Ive been looking for you everywhere.
Where've you been?

484
00:37:54,507 --> 00:37:57,027
I've got lots of old
friends I want you to meet.

485
00:37:57,062 --> 00:37:58,255
Come on. Hurry. Lets go.

486
00:38:07,107 --> 00:38:12,347
The US economy is on
the up. It's easy to say.

487
00:38:12,382 --> 00:38:14,986
The threat of terror is finished.

488
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,936
You can see what's happening in Europe.

489
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:24,701
Whatever we do they're all amazed
by the Turkish American alliance.

490
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:30,420
Even if we are a superpower we can't
manage the whole burden ourselves.

491
00:38:30,467 --> 00:38:31,263
True.

492
00:38:31,307 --> 00:38:32,137
Excuse me.

493
00:38:34,707 --> 00:38:35,583
Of course.

494
00:38:35,627 --> 00:38:39,415
He's absolutely right. C'mon now guys,
forget about business. Let's have some fun.

495
00:39:39,427 --> 00:39:40,257
Cinderella.

496
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:54,221
So, human. How was it?
Did you like it?

497
00:39:56,667 --> 00:39:58,339
If you'd given me five or ten minutes
more would it have killed you?

498
00:39:58,387 --> 00:40:00,582
Don't be ironic, human.

499
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:02,895
Where's that cool pose now?

500
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:15,375
I died too soon.

501
00:40:15,427 --> 00:40:16,940
You threw yourself off.

502
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:19,303
That's a kind of bad luck.

503
00:40:20,387 --> 00:40:26,576
The first part of life finished with a
suicide and bad luck. Look to the rest.

504
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:29,860
Listen to that.
You stil don't understand.

505
00:40:33,027 --> 00:40:38,306
I'm unlucky, unlucky and you hand over
your flash disc to Mr. Salim.

506
00:40:40,547 --> 00:40:44,222
You say your watch is broken and it's
been saying 7.30 for a week.

507
00:40:44,267 --> 00:40:48,021
Haven't you got a cell phone?
Set the alarm and get up.

508
00:40:49,627 --> 00:40:52,543
When you get in a taxi
you look at the driver and...

509
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:55,459
...see what he's like, thief
or not? What's he like?

510
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:57,944
You just get in, whatever.

511
00:41:00,147 --> 00:41:04,186
What were you doing only two nights before
your presentation?

512
00:41:05,107 --> 00:41:05,937
What's that?

513
00:41:09,347 --> 00:41:10,575
Goooooaaal!

514
00:41:11,787 --> 00:41:15,227
You pick up a hairdryer
when your hair is wet...

515
00:41:15,262 --> 00:41:18,663
...it's lucky you
weren't struck dead.

516
00:41:18,707 --> 00:41:21,380
Yes, you're lucky you. And if you hadn't died
when you jumped off that building

517
00:41:21,427 --> 00:41:24,225
I wouldn't have seen the state youdve got to.
If you hadn't died I'd've seen you.

518
00:41:25,587 --> 00:41:28,385
Look. I wasn't aware of that.

519
00:41:30,227 --> 00:41:31,216
Maybe you're right.

520
00:41:32,227 --> 00:41:35,642
And he said this stuff
like I'd rather be here than...

521
00:41:35,677 --> 00:41:39,057
...living that unlucky,
ill-starred life and all that.

522
00:41:47,347 --> 00:41:48,462
I'm really sorry.

523
00:41:49,267 --> 00:41:50,143
That's great.

524
00:41:51,587 --> 00:41:55,978
Now it's time to ask you what good deeds
you did and count your sins.

525
00:41:56,027 --> 00:41:58,257
An I'm sure if you gave me
another chance.

526
00:42:00,427 --> 00:42:01,907
I could prove that I've changed.

527
00:42:01,942 --> 00:42:03,135
What kind of chance?

528
00:42:04,467 --> 00:42:07,664
I mean I'm not talking abut five years time.
Don't misunderstand.

529
00:42:08,267 --> 00:42:09,700
Theres the suicide.

530
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:14,739
If I could go back to just before that,
that would be enough for me.

531
00:42:15,507 --> 00:42:16,337
Of course, OK.

532
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:31,576
When I said a just before that,
I meant before I fell.

533
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:33,621
I gather you misunderstood.

534
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:35,544
Look, bud. Are you serious?

535
00:42:37,467 --> 00:42:39,747
Sometimes people die in
hospital and the doctors...

536
00:42:39,782 --> 00:42:41,977
...give them an electric
shock on their chest

537
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:45,781
and they say they went to the
other side and came baack.

538
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:47,982
Could you do something like that?

539
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:51,943
My friend. Are we playing ping-pong here?
Go to the other side and what have you.

540
00:42:52,907 --> 00:42:55,296
Doctors do that.
Nothing to do with us.

541
00:42:56,147 --> 00:42:58,945
Have you seen the light at the
end of the tunnel yet?

542
00:42:58,987 --> 00:42:59,942
No...

543
00:43:00,267 --> 00:43:01,097
Well.

544
00:43:01,147 --> 00:43:02,626
Really man, what's all this?

545
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:03,656
I dunno.

546
00:43:05,507 --> 00:43:09,420
Look, I promise I won't think
things like that again.

547
00:43:09,467 --> 00:43:14,382
I'll be responsible for everything I do
and I won't curse my bad luck.

548
00:43:17,187 --> 00:43:18,017
Please.

549
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:26,064
But, if you do the opposite in the future
youll be back here in a flash. Watch out.

550
00:43:26,787 --> 00:43:27,583
OK.

551
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:31,402
OK. But after this what you do
with your life is your affair.

552
00:43:31,437 --> 00:43:34,697
What you've seen five years
into the future is no guarantee.

553
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:41,301
What you do and where you
get to I don't know. It's up to you.

554
00:43:42,227 --> 00:43:44,138
It's always like that.

555
00:43:45,907 --> 00:43:46,737
I accept.

556
00:44:07,827 --> 00:44:11,058
Tolga! Tolga!
Don't do it man!

557
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:16,898
- OK! OK! I'm not gonna jump.
- Stop! Stop! Youll fall. Be careful.

558
00:44:16,947 --> 00:44:21,896
OK! OK! Quiet! I won't jump.
I'm here. Finished.

559
00:44:23,547 --> 00:44:24,423
Lets go.

560
00:44:24,827 --> 00:44:26,101
What are you doing then?

561
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:33,857
Everybody creates their own luck in life.
I believe that now.

562
00:44:34,707 --> 00:44:39,701
What happened to you on the roof? Did you
get too much oxygen? I don't get it, man.

563
00:44:41,267 --> 00:44:44,147
Look man, I'm just gonna
get it together. I will do my...

564
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:47,027
...resentation again and get
my job back. I'm serious.

565
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:49,541
Go for it. That's you. Go on.

566
00:44:49,587 --> 00:44:52,818
Now, I'm going out this door
and I'll start a brand new life.

567
00:44:52,867 --> 00:44:59,136
New luck, new hope, a new life. You won't
believe what's gonna happen.

568
00:45:01,467 --> 00:45:02,695
Tolga!

569
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:06,744
What an unlucky guy you are.

570
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:11,547
Don't say that Meto. If only
I'd looked left and right.

571
00:45:11,582 --> 00:45:13,902
I got away lightly
from this accident.

572
00:45:14,707 --> 00:45:19,178
A couple of scratches and a broken
bone or two. Stuff happens.

573
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:23,584
Tolga, you never said
anything like that before.

574
00:45:24,107 --> 00:45:28,737
It sounds like someone else is talking
in the room. What did they give you, man?

575
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:32,507
Meto, this situation is
nothing for me. I'm gonna get...

576
00:45:32,542 --> 00:45:35,817
...my job back.
Did you bring my laptop?

577
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:37,778
Yes, Ibrought it. I did.

578
00:45:39,067 --> 00:45:40,978
Excuse me, sorry.

579
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:43,386
I'll just check my projects again.

580
00:45:44,027 --> 00:45:51,422
Please copy all the things from Salim's
computer and bring them to me.

581
00:45:52,147 --> 00:45:54,820
OK, man. I'll deal with it.

582
00:45:54,947 --> 00:45:56,426
Can I come in?

583
00:45:56,467 --> 00:45:57,456
Yes, Miss Ebru.
What are you saying?

584
00:46:04,107 --> 00:46:04,937
Get out.

585
00:46:05,987 --> 00:46:06,817
Go.

586
00:46:14,547 --> 00:46:15,343
Get well soon.

587
00:46:15,387 --> 00:46:16,352
Thank you.

588
00:46:16,387 --> 00:46:19,265
I'm really sorry.
We were all shocked.

589
00:46:19,987 --> 00:46:22,581
At the same time my father wishes
to convey his condolences.

590
00:46:22,627 --> 00:46:23,662
Thank you.

591
00:46:25,427 --> 00:46:30,262
However much I'm the Personel Director,
that's not why I'm here.

592
00:46:31,467 --> 00:46:37,064
Actually I didnt even know youd been fired.
Everything happened at once I guess.

593
00:46:39,627 --> 00:46:43,097
Yes, a bit like that.

594
00:46:43,147 --> 00:46:50,227
By the way, the company will pick
up all your hospital bills.

595
00:46:50,262 --> 00:46:52,787
Actually, theres no need for any of that.

596
00:46:52,827 --> 00:46:55,387
I mean, theres no need
for you to feel guilty.

597
00:46:55,422 --> 00:46:57,947
It's just about
my carelessness.

598
00:46:57,987 --> 00:46:59,261
You cant be serious.

599
00:47:00,107 --> 00:47:04,507
What happened at the
presentation in the morning...

600
00:47:04,542 --> 00:47:06,702
...then getting thrown out of work.

601
00:47:07,227 --> 00:47:09,695
I was going to the company by
boat and arrived at Uskudar

602
00:47:09,747 --> 00:47:13,706
When i fell in the water
and I had a flash disk...

603
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,703
...in my pocket and that fell in too.

604
00:47:16,107 --> 00:47:21,704
Then I came to the office and
started my presentation.

605
00:47:21,747 --> 00:47:27,856
Ahh. What's this Picture id never seen.

606
00:47:28,307 --> 00:47:32,141
Nothing.
I just remembered the pictures.

607
00:47:34,347 --> 00:47:37,259
If theres anything you need at all.

608
00:47:37,307 --> 00:47:38,581
No. Thanks, really.

609
00:47:39,827 --> 00:47:45,060
Don't forget really. O, once more.
Get well soon.

610
00:48:05,187 --> 00:48:06,063
C'mon Meto.

611
00:48:09,427 --> 00:48:14,137
But weve been planning a holiday for weeks.
Ive even got my clothes ready.

612
00:48:15,507 --> 00:48:17,987
What can I do, baby. The
guy had a traffic accident...

613
00:48:18,022 --> 00:48:20,455
...and I had to get him
to sign those documents.

614
00:48:20,507 --> 00:48:23,206
Just because of your
stupid mistake we cant...

615
00:48:23,241 --> 00:48:25,906
...go on holiday again. I
really cant believe it.

616
00:48:26,627 --> 00:48:30,825
It's not a mistake, baby. Not a mistake.
Just the opposite.

617
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:34,621
You know I have to make sure that this
bogus company is in his name.

618
00:48:35,307 --> 00:48:38,247
That way we avoid all the
legal responsibility.

619
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:41,152
Now the shares hav erisen
in value and we with...

620
00:48:41,187 --> 00:48:44,020
...just one signature can put
the company in our name.

621
00:48:44,067 --> 00:48:45,819
The idiot hasn't a clue.

622
00:48:45,867 --> 00:48:48,700
Can you really do it?
It's always talk, talk with you!

623
00:48:49,547 --> 00:48:50,775
You leave that to me.

624
00:48:53,307 --> 00:48:56,697
Waiting in the wings is athe Alacity Project
and that's where the real money is.

625
00:48:57,787 --> 00:49:02,644
Now we're going on a
holiday to Amsterdam...

626
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:07,502
...but later we'll go on
a world tour. Together.

627
00:49:08,387 --> 00:49:11,299
I'm going to the hospital now
to get his signature.

628
00:49:12,707 --> 00:49:14,663
Don't worry everything's
going to be fine.

629
00:49:14,707 --> 00:49:15,583
OK.

630
00:49:23,987 --> 00:49:26,023
Ah! Tolga. Ah!

631
00:49:27,747 --> 00:49:30,547
I cant explain what I felt
when I heard the screech of...

632
00:49:30,582 --> 00:49:33,300
...brakes and ran to the
window to see the horror.

633
00:49:33,347 --> 00:49:34,905
You really upset everyone
and we're all very sorry.

634
00:49:36,867 --> 00:49:40,098
The phone's ringing.
Won't you answer it?

635
00:49:41,147 --> 00:49:44,139
Oh. Ah. Hold on a second.
I'll help you.

636
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:53,260
Tolga, listen man, listen. Man,
I went to that psycho's room

637
00:49:53,307 --> 00:49:58,745
He's got a computer, you know, full of your
presentations he didnt like.

638
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:01,112
That guy's using you.
He's a thief, a rogue.

639
00:50:01,147 --> 00:50:04,742
And listen to this, as if that wasn't enough,
he's gonna steal your Alacity Project.

640
00:50:04,787 --> 00:50:06,903
He's complete bastard.

641
00:50:07,987 --> 00:50:11,423
You're absolutely right.
Yes. Of course.

642
00:50:13,347 --> 00:50:16,419
Mr. Salim. Sorry for the trouble.

643
00:50:16,467 --> 00:50:19,618
My dear Tolga.
That's what pals are for.

644
00:50:23,347 --> 00:50:25,178
Sometimes that happens.

645
00:50:25,227 --> 00:50:29,152
What are you talking
about? I don't get you.

646
00:50:29,187 --> 00:50:33,146
The guy's a thief and
using you. A thief. A thief.

647
00:50:33,507 --> 00:50:38,422
I love you too. Say hi to everyone.
Take care. See you soon.

648
00:50:42,387 --> 00:50:46,460
Of course when all your friends heard about
your accident they wanted to speak to you.

649
00:50:47,027 --> 00:50:50,224
No, no theres definitely something wrong.

650
00:50:54,827 --> 00:50:57,467
While I'm here, I mentioned
there were a couple...

651
00:50:57,502 --> 00:51:00,061
...of formalities which
need your signature.

652
00:51:01,027 --> 00:51:02,699
Now is not the time for signatures.

653
00:51:04,467 --> 00:51:05,472
No, it's not important now.

654
00:51:05,507 --> 00:51:07,667
A couple of signatures.
We'll just sign these two now.

655
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:10,261
No, it's not the time now.

656
00:51:12,947 --> 00:51:18,544
Lets do it like this. Theres
that unfinished presentation.

657
00:51:19,547 --> 00:51:21,627
I'll come over to the
office and finish it off...

658
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:23,663
...then we'll talk about
the signatures.

659
00:51:25,747 --> 00:51:28,659
OK. Understood.
When then?

660
00:51:29,547 --> 00:51:30,377
As soon as I'm up.

661
00:51:31,347 --> 00:51:33,099
As soon as you're up. OK.

662
00:51:33,147 --> 00:51:38,346
Whatever you want.
D'you need anything?

663
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:39,297
No.

664
00:51:40,747 --> 00:51:42,392
OK. Theres a couple of meetings...

665
00:51:42,427 --> 00:51:45,737
...I have to go to, my dear
Tolga. Get well soon.

666
00:51:54,107 --> 00:51:55,142
Bastard.

667
00:51:58,587 --> 00:52:00,657
Was it easy to copy?

668
00:52:00,707 --> 00:52:03,824
A cinch. Like taking candy from a baby.

669
00:52:03,867 --> 00:52:07,382
Look man, these are the files that were on
that bastard Salim's computer.

670
00:52:07,827 --> 00:52:10,580
There it is, the Alacity Project.
Can you see?

671
00:52:12,627 --> 00:52:16,620
So that's why that bastard is trying to
get me to sign so often.

672
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:23,015
Man, there are guys like that who try tor ip
you off. And he's one of them.

673
00:52:23,467 --> 00:52:28,700
So Ebru coming all this way to sweet talk me
and appear so kind was in fact her reason.

674
00:52:29,987 --> 00:52:35,937
Shit, they created a company.

675
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:40,017
So you've finally opened your eyes.

676
00:52:41,067 --> 00:52:46,147
I sure have. Look, I could reach
those heights like that.

677
00:52:46,182 --> 00:52:47,978
What? What heights?

678
00:52:49,547 --> 00:52:57,227
If I'm just their tool.
But Ebru. Our children.

679
00:53:01,627 --> 00:53:04,346
Meto. I'm really confused, man.

680
00:53:04,387 --> 00:53:06,824
That's for sure. What are
you saying? I dont get it.

681
00:53:06,859 --> 00:53:09,261
Ebru, kids. What are you
saying? Are you alright?

682
00:53:12,387 --> 00:53:13,376
Ahh. Ebru.

683
00:53:14,627 --> 00:53:17,147
Don't blame her. Maybe
she's not guilty at all.

684
00:53:17,182 --> 00:53:19,615
Doesn't even know.
I don't know.

685
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:23,284
It's completely up to me.
I'm not like that. I don't want...

686
00:53:23,319 --> 00:53:26,902
...a life or riches like that.
If it's like that - forget it.

687
00:53:27,547 --> 00:53:30,459
What riches? We have nothing.
You're talking about riches.

688
00:53:31,307 --> 00:53:34,617
What are you saying? They must be giving
you something here. Must be.

689
00:53:57,107 --> 00:54:00,702
Thank you for sparing me
a little of your precious time

690
00:54:01,507 --> 00:54:07,821
But I guess a few words arent important for
a few million dollars of your dirty Money.

691
00:54:08,387 --> 00:54:11,987
Getting straight to the point I
want you to know that I won't return...

692
00:54:12,022 --> 00:54:15,582
...the share of the bogus
company you formed in my name

693
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:19,342
in order to avoid tax and legal problems.

694
00:54:20,347 --> 00:54:21,416
I have all the regions here.

695
00:54:22,787 --> 00:54:25,779
For example these are my projects...

696
00:54:26,427 --> 00:54:29,107
...which weren't liked but
they've all been viewed.

697
00:54:29,142 --> 00:54:30,335
Hmm.

698
00:54:34,787 --> 00:54:38,063
Don't you find this
a bit strange, Mr. Salim?

699
00:54:39,547 --> 00:54:42,186
Yes sir, a bit strange.

700
00:54:45,027 --> 00:54:49,464
Now then, apart from you as
company project director...

701
00:54:49,507 --> 00:54:55,457
...who could know about new projects
and do something like this?

702
00:54:55,507 --> 00:55:03,061
Err. I don't know Mr. Timur. It means
someone's in need of a lot of money.

703
00:55:05,347 --> 00:55:09,101
If that was me my presence here would
probably have no meaning.

704
00:55:10,147 --> 00:55:12,966
If that's the case you accept
that those projects you...

705
00:55:13,001 --> 00:55:15,785
...claimed you threw in the
bin are worth something then.

706
00:55:18,387 --> 00:55:20,503
No, sir I...

707
00:55:20,547 --> 00:55:25,177
What? If the projects are valuable
why weren't they presented to us?

708
00:55:26,147 --> 00:55:30,902
If they're worthless how can someone
else make use of them?

709
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:33,632
Difficult questions, Mr. Salim?

710
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:37,455
It's terrible when theres
no place to hide.

711
00:55:40,147 --> 00:55:46,382
Mr. Timur, look, all these err,
an explanation is very... some projects.

712
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:59,764
Now to you, young man.
This, err, bogus company...

713
00:55:59,799 --> 00:56:04,861
...these shares, you can do
what you want with them.

714
00:56:06,187 --> 00:56:07,745
As part of our corporate policy
we do not claim the right...

715
00:56:07,787 --> 00:56:12,815
...to a company which doesn't belong to us,
even if it's in our name.

716
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,472
You mean, now.

717
00:56:15,507 --> 00:56:19,705
What's that? You think our
corporation is a game?

718
00:56:25,027 --> 00:56:29,147
I never planned to be
part of a bogus company...

719
00:56:29,182 --> 00:56:33,220
...but what with one
ting and another...

720
00:56:33,267 --> 00:56:36,792
If you're sincere about
what you say and...

721
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:40,376
...if there is a need for
a new project manager...

722
00:56:41,787 --> 00:56:47,817
I will make you a proposal. If you
accept that place is yours.

723
00:57:12,427 --> 00:57:14,622
O my god. Am I dead again?
Now what?

724
00:57:14,667 --> 00:57:17,784
Is this like counter strike?
How many more lives?

725
00:57:17,827 --> 00:57:19,419
He's pretty cool.

726
00:57:19,467 --> 00:57:22,584
Just as I'm getting mylife
together I die and rise again.

727
00:57:22,627 --> 00:57:24,663
What happened?
Why are you here again?

728
00:57:25,627 --> 00:57:27,392
Look here you. Because
you've seen what's going to...

729
00:57:27,427 --> 00:57:29,258
...happen in five years time you
couldve chosen the easy route.

730
00:57:33,987 --> 00:57:36,421
Then we wouldve had to take
you back again with us.

731
00:57:36,467 --> 00:57:42,497
But you've surprised both of us.
Life is presented to you as a gift.

732
00:57:42,547 --> 00:57:49,862
Live it well or that life can be
taken away from you.

733
00:57:52,307 --> 00:57:56,300
Enjoy the choices you make human.

734
00:59:36,507 --> 00:59:37,735
Ah! Thank you.

735
00:59:37,787 --> 00:59:39,584
You're welcome.

736
00:59:43,427 --> 00:59:45,065
Filiz, has Ebru arrived?

737
00:59:45,107 --> 00:59:47,667
No, she hasn't.
She didnt say anything.

738
00:59:47,707 --> 00:59:50,699
What's between Tolga and Ebru?

739
00:59:54,147 --> 00:59:54,943
I don't know.

740
00:59:57,587 --> 01:00:05,585
Look Filiz. You brought Ebru up
and sacrificed yourself for her.

741
01:00:10,467 --> 01:00:15,707
You havent married or
had children. As a woman...

742
01:00:15,742 --> 01:00:20,940
...you know her well.
But I want to know.

743
01:00:22,267 --> 01:00:26,101
Actually she doesn't say much to me now...

744
01:00:36,387 --> 01:00:37,263
but...

745
01:00:44,747 --> 01:00:46,544
...if you really want to
know

746
01:00:48,547 --> 01:00:49,423
our girl's in love.

747
01:01:00,107 --> 01:01:01,017
Ebru.

748
01:01:01,707 --> 01:01:02,583
Yes.

749
01:01:02,627 --> 01:01:05,141
Last night I had a lovely dream.

750
01:01:05,187 --> 01:01:06,620
Tell me about it.

751
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:13,299
A little girl approaches from far away,
a child with tiny little hands...

752
01:01:13,347 --> 01:01:17,863
so sweet, cherry-red lips and with
her a perfect beauty.

753
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:25,775
Long- haired like a fairy.

754
01:01:28,227 --> 01:01:31,902
And that's her mother.
Just like you.

755
01:01:33,427 --> 01:01:37,306
And with them theres a man.

756
01:01:37,347 --> 01:01:39,986
The happiest man in the world.

757
01:01:40,027 --> 01:01:46,466
His smile's a bit like mine.
In fact he is me.

758
01:01:48,947 --> 01:01:50,539
And there are the in-laws.

759
01:01:50,587 --> 01:01:56,267
They're really happy to. I
didnt quite get why there...

760
01:01:56,302 --> 01:02:01,978
...we happy. And aunts
and uncles-also happy.

761
01:02:04,027 --> 01:02:08,582
Whya re you happy?
I'm not really asking.

762
01:02:08,617 --> 01:02:13,138
One of teh aunt's
has a child - Unal.

763
01:02:13,227 --> 01:02:18,347
You know-she says. How can I know?
I havent seen him for ten years.

764
01:02:18,382 --> 01:02:21,180
Yes, my love. The dream.
What happens in the end?

765
01:02:21,227 --> 01:02:25,379
- What? - A lovely big family
but what happens in the end?

766
01:02:32,307 --> 01:02:33,103
Ebru.

767
01:02:33,147 --> 01:02:34,057
Yes.

768
01:02:35,507 --> 01:02:37,145
I want the dream to be real.

769
01:02:37,227 --> 01:02:38,342
How?

770
01:02:40,707 --> 01:02:41,742
Will you marry me?

771
01:02:46,147 --> 01:02:46,943
Yes.

772
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:24,186
When ever I think about the wedding
I run out of breath.

773
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:27,142
Thank god that Tolga is doing
most of the work.

774
01:03:30,427 --> 01:03:31,257
How are you, Tolga?

775
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:32,983
Hello, sir.

776
01:03:37,387 --> 01:03:39,105
Or should I start to say 'groom'.

777
01:03:39,147 --> 01:03:40,421
You know best, sir.

778
01:03:42,227 --> 01:03:48,700
Now, dear Tolga. There seem to be some
problems with the Alacity project.

779
01:03:48,747 --> 01:03:52,296
The investors have suddenly said that
they find the price too high.

780
01:03:54,227 --> 01:03:58,345
You know the project well and
I can't trust anybody else.

781
01:03:59,267 --> 01:04:00,825
Just as we're talking about
weddings and honeymoons

782
01:04:01,667 --> 01:04:03,658
you will have to be out of the
office for a long time.

783
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:08,941
I'm saying, first solve this problem.

784
01:04:08,987 --> 01:04:12,024
Don't worry, sir.
I'll see to it.

785
01:04:12,067 --> 01:04:13,739
Finish it quickly.

786
01:04:17,427 --> 01:04:19,099
This position suits you - ha!

787
01:04:20,267 --> 01:04:21,097
Thanks.

788
01:04:48,107 --> 01:04:52,385
Tolga. Look at that.
Arent those our investors?

789
01:04:54,547 --> 01:04:58,586
What kind of a man are you?
What kind of a guy is that?

790
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:01,659
Damn it.

791
01:05:21,347 --> 01:05:25,340
You seem pretty sturdy. Bravo.

792
01:05:25,707 --> 01:05:28,346
Nothing to do with it.
Call it tense.

793
01:05:30,507 --> 01:05:32,862
So it's just to relax then.

794
01:05:34,147 --> 01:05:37,107
Actually you don't need a
massage to relax. It would...

795
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:40,065
...relax you just to get
mad and curse your fate.

796
01:05:41,427 --> 01:05:42,303
You.

797
01:05:43,427 --> 01:05:44,257
You.

798
01:05:47,387 --> 01:05:50,936
My name isnt on the invitation list.
How rude.

799
01:05:52,067 --> 01:05:53,420
What are you doing here?

800
01:05:57,307 --> 01:06:04,622
Look, if you remeber, we made an
agreement with you, human.

801
01:06:05,947 --> 01:06:07,221
Damn it.

802
01:06:10,787 --> 01:06:14,985
Oh. That. Itjust slipped out.

803
01:06:16,107 --> 01:06:21,340
I guess my tongue is guilty I mean.
But, why not?

804
01:06:22,787 --> 01:06:29,545
It's just that one thing happened after
another. What can I do? I'm really sorry.

805
01:06:30,107 --> 01:06:32,416
Theres no point apologising to me.

806
01:06:33,307 --> 01:06:34,626
What's gonna happen now then?

807
01:06:35,307 --> 01:06:42,019
I used my initiative and brough you here.
And so it's my job to take you back.

808
01:06:44,627 --> 01:06:45,696
Take me back?

809
01:06:46,147 --> 01:06:49,935
But, just as I was getting
ready to marry, it's not fair.

810
01:06:49,987 --> 01:06:53,138
Theres nothing we can do human.

811
01:06:55,427 --> 01:07:01,775
But look, everything happened at once.
I was in such a bad state that...

812
01:07:02,707 --> 01:07:08,179
Isnt thatjust like life really? The whole
point of you making decisions, free will.

813
01:07:08,747 --> 01:07:12,057
So what's gonna happen now then?
Will I suddenly disappear?

814
01:07:12,107 --> 01:07:16,066
No, no. It's not like that at all.

815
01:07:16,867 --> 01:07:23,056
Look; what we showed you before was
what could happen in the future.

816
01:07:23,467 --> 01:07:25,025
Now, it's different.

817
01:07:25,427 --> 01:07:27,895
- Ah, something better will happen.
- Yes.

818
01:07:27,947 --> 01:07:31,178
- What?
- You really die.

819
01:07:32,627 --> 01:07:38,187
A gas bottle explodes, a train crash,
a rock falling, a bear escapes, we'll see.

820
01:07:38,222 --> 01:07:39,063
What?

821
01:07:39,947 --> 01:07:44,702
He didnt express it very well.
Whereas you have a lot of choices...

822
01:07:45,747 --> 01:07:51,026
and we will give you three days
to say goodbye to the world.

823
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:51,943
What a bonus.

824
01:07:53,147 --> 01:07:54,023
C'mon get up.

825
01:08:06,147 --> 01:08:11,744
Welcome make yourself at home.
Don't feel like strangers anymore.

826
01:08:16,027 --> 01:08:22,739
I can see don't worry. But don't
feel like you're staying long.

827
01:08:27,907 --> 01:08:30,707
Look, there are millions
of people in the world.

828
01:08:30,742 --> 01:08:33,505
Why was I the only
one given a chance?

829
01:08:34,587 --> 01:08:37,663
I don't know. I mean
theres Edison and Napoleon...

830
01:08:37,698 --> 01:08:40,739
...there's Einstein. Why
didnt they come back?

831
01:08:43,027 --> 01:08:46,112
Human, lots of people
are happy about...

832
01:08:46,147 --> 01:08:49,264
...where they are and as the
years go by none return.

833
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:52,340
Don't make fun of me. I'm curious really.

834
01:08:54,987 --> 01:08:59,185
How dyou know? Can you tell
the people around you?

835
01:09:00,387 --> 01:09:05,222
No. What about it?
None were like you.

836
01:09:06,907 --> 01:09:08,579
I'd never thought of that.

837
01:09:10,827 --> 01:09:15,072
Weren't you ever paranoid
that everyone in the world...

838
01:09:15,107 --> 01:09:19,385
...was created for you and they
were all playing a role for you?

839
01:09:21,427 --> 01:09:24,912
So you're saying that
everyone has their own...

840
01:09:24,947 --> 01:09:28,417
...separate world. Is that
it? What are you saying?

841
01:09:30,507 --> 01:09:32,304
Weve got a lot of work to do with you.

842
01:09:32,987 --> 01:09:34,512
People. I really don't
understand them.

843
01:09:34,547 --> 01:09:37,584
This feeling of supporting a team,
being in love, with a team.

844
01:09:37,627 --> 01:09:42,655
For example a man comes to us whose
team was playing away and was knifed.

845
01:09:42,707 --> 01:09:47,152
At home, hungry kids. We tell
him you had a fight to the...

846
01:09:47,187 --> 01:09:51,703
...death and he says: 'I'd die for
my team'. As if he wasn't dead.

847
01:09:51,747 --> 01:09:55,137
I'd really die for my local team too.

848
01:09:55,987 --> 01:09:59,696
My son. Even the players
change teams for money.

849
01:10:00,627 --> 01:10:03,824
You grow up living and breathing a team.
What is it about you?

850
01:10:04,147 --> 01:10:05,296
They're professional.

851
01:10:06,027 --> 01:10:07,779
You don't get money from it.

852
01:10:09,387 --> 01:10:12,777
During the season the
prayer lines are jammed.

853
01:10:13,427 --> 01:10:17,104
Please god, what about a
goal, what about a goal now...

854
01:10:17,139 --> 01:10:20,782
...this and that, you know,
not this, not that, a goal.

855
01:10:20,827 --> 01:10:22,943
That's a waste of time.

856
01:10:22,987 --> 01:10:25,820
My team went down, you know.
The angels didnt protect them.

857
01:10:26,947 --> 01:10:30,303
Words. Are we football middlemen
that we can protect your team?

858
01:10:30,347 --> 01:10:33,623
If you played with the ball like a man
and didnt fall over. I'll strike you down.

859
01:10:34,947 --> 01:10:37,507
Can you cripple someone?

860
01:10:37,947 --> 01:10:40,461
I didnt mean that.
I meant I'll hit you.

861
01:10:41,507 --> 01:10:43,392
I think maybe we've
become too familiar...

862
01:10:43,427 --> 01:10:45,338
...and it's time to put
some distance between us.

863
01:10:46,747 --> 01:10:50,342
Ah, so it's like that
then now, is it? I get it.

864
01:10:55,467 --> 01:10:57,059
Darling we're home.

865
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:02,057
O dear Ebru.
What do I say to Ebru?

866
01:11:03,387 --> 01:11:04,536
Can everyone see you?

867
01:11:05,107 --> 01:11:06,426
Can they see me?

868
01:11:06,467 --> 01:11:09,265
Are you only visible to me,
I mean, or to everyone? Ssh.

869
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:12,458
Am i Casper? Of course
everyone can see me.

870
01:11:12,507 --> 01:11:13,496
Smile play the part.

871
01:11:18,147 --> 01:11:23,904
Hi, I thought I'd get used to our
house and use my keys.

872
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:26,256
Of course you should use them sweetie.
This is your home.

873
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:34,816
I'll introduce you.

874
01:11:37,547 --> 01:11:45,545
Ebru, my fiancee. Filiz, Ebru's aunt,
big sister, everything. Right?

875
01:11:46,307 --> 01:11:47,535
- Right?
- Uhuh.

876
01:11:55,027 --> 01:11:55,857
Oh. My uncle.

877
01:11:56,867 --> 01:11:57,822
Your uncle?

878
01:11:57,867 --> 01:11:58,697
Yes, my uncle.

879
01:11:58,907 --> 01:12:01,137
Darling, you told me you
had no relatives.

880
01:12:01,187 --> 01:12:06,307
I don't, still don't. My dead aunts
husband. No blood ties.

881
01:12:07,627 --> 01:12:10,824
Welcome, pleased to meet you.
What's your name?

882
01:12:11,707 --> 01:12:13,743
Here we are at the best bit. Err. Killer.

883
01:12:17,387 --> 01:12:18,263
Kill-er.

884
01:12:19,747 --> 01:12:20,623
Kill-er.

885
01:12:22,667 --> 01:12:23,543
One word.

886
01:12:23,947 --> 01:12:30,022
Killer. A terrible name that's difficult
to say. What kind of a name is that?

887
01:12:31,907 --> 01:12:35,263
It's best if we go to the kitchen.
Early in the morning the designer

888
01:12:35,307 --> 01:12:40,062
and the lighting people are coming.
I want to make a plan with Filiz.

889
01:12:40,107 --> 01:12:41,904
It's going to be lovely, lovely.

890
01:12:44,107 --> 01:12:45,699
Not long to wait.

891
01:12:49,867 --> 01:12:50,822
See you later darling.

892
01:12:52,547 --> 01:12:53,343
Filiz.

893
01:12:53,987 --> 01:13:00,381
Ive never seen such a weirdo.
People get up. Do something.

894
01:13:00,427 --> 01:13:04,136
I don't know. Is he from the circus?
Strange clothes.

895
01:13:17,507 --> 01:13:25,300
D'you have to do that? I mean,
dyou have to take me back?

896
01:13:25,347 --> 01:13:29,135
Look, human. We made an
agreement with you, right?

897
01:13:29,707 --> 01:13:33,302
The best thing for you to do is forget
the other alternatives. Less painful.

898
01:13:33,587 --> 01:13:37,182
But Ebru.
She's so happy.

899
01:13:39,307 --> 01:13:40,137
I mean, I think.

900
01:13:41,027 --> 01:13:44,815
You find the love of your life but
two days before the wedding...

901
01:13:46,747 --> 01:13:48,226
Put yourself in her shoes.

902
01:13:50,107 --> 01:13:52,575
Ha, I know this. Lying down, sleeping.

903
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:55,746
It's great.

904
01:13:55,787 --> 01:13:57,937
Listen to me. Where am I going to
sleep tonight?

905
01:14:49,347 --> 01:14:50,257
Where are Ebru and Filiz?

906
01:14:52,027 --> 01:14:53,824
Dunno. In the kitchen maybe.

907
01:14:54,667 --> 01:14:56,180
What's that then?

908
01:15:01,307 --> 01:15:02,422
Angels.

909
01:15:03,547 --> 01:15:04,377
Angels?

910
01:15:05,547 --> 01:15:07,458
They don't look much like
that over there, right?

911
01:15:08,507 --> 01:15:14,503
My son, theres no such thing as
an angel with wings. Very hard to use.

912
01:15:16,067 --> 01:15:20,618
Tolga? I'm suddenly feeling
very odd, dyou know?

913
01:15:20,667 --> 01:15:24,342
Look man, I don't wanna go there.
It's really not the right time.

914
01:15:24,387 --> 01:15:27,584
That's irrelevant.
I feel really hungry.

915
01:15:27,627 --> 01:15:28,907
What did you eat this morning?

916
01:15:28,942 --> 01:15:31,023
Nothing, really.

917
01:15:31,067 --> 01:15:32,659
Tell me, I don't know.

918
01:15:33,747 --> 01:15:38,821
Those angels really arent bad at all.
Apart from the wings.

919
01:15:43,867 --> 01:15:46,984
Ebru, for gods sake say something.
What's this?

920
01:15:47,027 --> 01:15:50,224
Filiz don't upset yourself.
Don't interfere it's rude.

921
01:15:51,507 --> 01:15:53,816
Slow down, uncle. It's not a race.

922
01:15:53,867 --> 01:15:59,419
No sir, not a race. He eats like a horse.
It's as if theres been a famine.

923
01:15:59,467 --> 01:16:03,346
Havent you got anything better to do?
Sticking your nose in my business.

924
01:16:04,627 --> 01:16:08,984
Never mind. Lets stop this now.
Lets talk about our honeymoon.

925
01:16:09,827 --> 01:16:14,298
The Maldives, Dubai,
Miami, the Bahamas.

926
01:16:14,347 --> 01:16:21,662
Theres no need to go so far. Theres Mersin.
You'll find heaven and hell there.

927
01:16:21,707 --> 01:16:22,776
What dyou say my dear Tolga?

928
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:26,723
To put it bluntly I want to
go somewhere I havent seen...

929
01:16:26,758 --> 01:16:29,659
...or been to before. We're
thinking of somewhere abroad.

930
01:16:30,227 --> 01:16:33,344
What dyou say to Tibet you two?
The way to Nirvana. Haha!

931
01:16:34,467 --> 01:16:39,985
That's all rubbish. Tibet, Miami.
I think the best would be Baghdad. Baghdad.

932
01:16:41,507 --> 01:16:44,817
Baghdad. Heaven. Hell.

933
01:16:46,147 --> 01:16:50,504
When it comes to your time I'll
show you heaven and hell from above.

934
01:16:52,267 --> 01:16:54,019
How about if we close this subject?

935
01:17:04,827 --> 01:17:08,987
What a strange woman Filiz
is. Fluff. Over at mine they...

936
01:17:09,022 --> 01:17:11,023
...make that type squawk.
Squawk.

937
01:17:11,067 --> 01:17:16,016
O if I get her on my watch. Will you eat?
Won't you? Will you?

938
01:17:17,307 --> 01:17:21,459
Butchers meat and a sheeps life.
Dyou know what I'm going through?

939
01:17:21,987 --> 01:17:24,342
Look at what I'm thinking
and your obsession.

940
01:17:25,427 --> 01:17:29,427
Look human, my son. Don't
twist this around making...

941
01:17:29,462 --> 01:17:33,420
...it a private matter
between you and me.

942
01:17:33,467 --> 01:17:35,344
The root of it is, I'm an ambassador.

943
01:17:37,387 --> 01:17:41,062
Ebru spent the whole evening thinking about
her dreams of living together.

944
01:17:42,027 --> 01:17:44,018
And I know they will never be real.
And desptie that she's so happy.

945
01:17:45,147 --> 01:17:49,243
She spends all her time
thinking about the future...

946
01:17:49,278 --> 01:17:53,340
...living with me and would
mutiny too, if she knew.

947
01:17:54,627 --> 01:18:00,736
Then like me she will leave a life unlived.

948
01:18:05,587 --> 01:18:06,656
No, I mustnt allow that.

949
01:18:12,227 --> 01:18:13,626
I want to ask you a question.

950
01:18:14,227 --> 01:18:15,057
Ask me darling.

951
01:18:17,427 --> 01:18:22,706
This is the eve of our
wedding but some things have...

952
01:18:22,741 --> 01:18:27,986
...happened really quickly,
have you ever thought that?

953
01:18:29,307 --> 01:18:37,225
Yes, a bit, went a bit quick,
but I'm not complaining about it.

954
01:18:39,027 --> 01:18:41,746
I don't know. After we
are married, I mean,

955
01:18:42,867 --> 01:18:48,146
maybe you'll regret it. Maybe
something else. I don't know.

956
01:18:48,227 --> 01:18:50,024
Is that what you're thinking?

957
01:18:50,867 --> 01:18:54,752
No, no. I'm asking
about you. I don't know.

958
01:18:54,787 --> 01:18:58,707
That's life. Everything's
possible. If you want...

959
01:18:58,742 --> 01:18:59,537
Tolga.

960
01:19:01,827 --> 01:19:07,459
I'm going to tell you something.
Maybe it's only been a little while.

961
01:19:07,507 --> 01:19:09,737
But we want someting really good,
do you realise?

962
01:19:12,987 --> 01:19:14,102
I love you.

963
01:19:17,467 --> 01:19:18,263
OK.

964
01:19:27,827 --> 01:19:29,545
I've got a strange feeling.

965
01:19:31,387 --> 01:19:36,780
Im listless but neither
hungry nor tired, dyou know?

966
01:19:38,427 --> 01:19:45,538
Inside I'm all excited but theres
really nothing to be excited about.

967
01:19:49,027 --> 01:19:52,417
A strange feeling.
Does it ever happen to you?

968
01:19:52,467 --> 01:19:56,547
For example, someone really,
really irritates you deep down...

969
01:19:56,582 --> 01:20:00,586
...but at the same time you
really want to see them.

970
01:20:01,627 --> 01:20:03,345
Like that woman, you know.

971
01:20:05,027 --> 01:20:05,903
Filiz.

972
01:20:06,307 --> 01:20:10,061
For example, we're totally out
of tune with each other you know

973
01:20:10,107 --> 01:20:15,625
but I really want to see her.
What's that then?

974
01:20:20,907 --> 01:20:22,625
I don't know how to say this.

975
01:20:28,027 --> 01:20:28,903
Ebru?

976
01:20:30,147 --> 01:20:31,136
Yes darling.

977
01:20:34,307 --> 01:20:36,138
You've become the dream
I cant have I guess.

978
01:20:38,747 --> 01:20:45,141
When you reach a goal the
other dreams fade away.

979
01:20:52,667 --> 01:20:56,262
This love is over for me.

980
01:21:01,947 --> 01:21:08,102
Hows that? Nothing can change so quickly
in a few days, can it?

981
01:21:10,547 --> 01:21:12,139
Tolga, you're not like that at all.

982
01:21:13,987 --> 01:21:16,262
How dyou know whether I'm
that kind of person or not?

983
01:21:18,107 --> 01:21:26,025
Maybe I'm a bad guy. Maybe
I'm not the Tolga you know.

984
01:21:29,827 --> 01:21:34,537
Yesterday, was that the thing you
were trying to explain to me?

985
01:21:37,427 --> 01:21:41,022
You mean, everything we've done
was a waste of time for you, is that it?

986
01:21:43,147 --> 01:21:47,140
What happened to your dream?
Your dream.

987
01:21:49,627 --> 01:21:55,384
That picture of a happy family?
Tolga, cant you say anything else?

988
01:21:56,227 --> 01:22:03,417
Look. This is to do with me.
It's my problem. About me.

989
01:22:07,667 --> 01:22:15,665
Believe me. Youll find someone
who loves you more than me.

990
01:22:19,587 --> 01:22:21,339
Don't try to cheer me up.

991
01:22:23,667 --> 01:22:25,146
I'm doing it for you.

992
01:22:25,547 --> 01:22:28,107
Go away - Please - Go away.

993
01:23:16,187 --> 01:23:17,540
I'm ready. We can go.

994
01:23:25,147 --> 01:23:30,380
Actually, thereve been some
changes to the program.

995
01:23:30,987 --> 01:23:31,783
You mean?

996
01:23:34,467 --> 01:23:38,983
In fact, it's great to be alive.
Wonderful.

997
01:23:39,947 --> 01:23:44,623
You humans learn the value
of life once you've lost it.

998
01:23:46,107 --> 01:23:50,703
Because I know what it's worth
I will start life one step ahead.

999
01:23:54,867 --> 01:23:55,743
Meaning?

1000
01:23:58,787 --> 01:24:04,107
You still don't get it.
Now look, it's like this.

1001
01:24:04,142 --> 01:24:06,780
Since I taught you to value life

1002
01:24:07,827 --> 01:24:11,387
and because I taught you
how to behave responsibly I

1003
01:24:11,422 --> 01:24:14,982
was given a reward.
I'm staying here too.

1004
01:24:18,747 --> 01:24:19,702
Sooo...

1005
01:24:19,747 --> 01:24:21,863
You don't have to go either.

1006
01:24:38,547 --> 01:24:39,377
Wheres Ebru?

1007
01:24:39,427 --> 01:24:41,895
Upstairs, but she doesn't
want to be disturbed.

1008
01:24:46,027 --> 01:24:47,585
What are you doing here?

1009
01:24:47,627 --> 01:24:49,060
- Give me five minutes, listen.
- Get out of here.

1010
01:24:50,027 --> 01:24:51,699
Give me five minutes, please.

1011
01:24:51,747 --> 01:24:54,386
Get out of here. I don't want to
listen to you anymore.

1012
01:24:54,787 --> 01:24:58,147
Theres been a huge mistake.
All mixed up. I mean difficult.

1013
01:24:58,182 --> 01:25:02,106
What's that?
Or am I still a dream for you.

1014
01:25:02,147 --> 01:25:03,626
But it's not what you imagine.

1015
01:25:05,227 --> 01:25:09,061
Look. You are the most
important thing in my life.

1016
01:25:09,107 --> 01:25:13,897
I'm a childs toy, that's all. You were
frightened of marrying me.

1017
01:25:13,947 --> 01:25:16,464
That's the only explanation
for it. Because you...

1018
01:25:16,499 --> 01:25:18,981
...were uncertain of your
love form e. Get it?

1019
01:25:20,187 --> 01:25:24,544
You lost me. Ah! What have I done.
And now you're trying to win me back again.

1020
01:25:25,027 --> 01:25:30,486
Before I proposed to you
I told you I had a dream.

1021
01:25:30,521 --> 01:25:35,945
You. Me. Our kids.
Actually, it wasn't a dream.

1022
01:25:36,787 --> 01:25:40,336
The angels showed me our
life in several years time.

1023
01:25:41,107 --> 01:25:45,146
The angels? Sooo... Then what?

1024
01:25:45,227 --> 01:25:49,459
Don't mess with me. Please. I told
you this morning that I wanted to leave you.

1025
01:25:50,747 --> 01:25:55,218
The angels, this time,
wanted things to go like this.

1026
01:25:55,267 --> 01:25:59,704
The angels. Tolga? Do you really
expect me to believe that nonsense?

1027
01:25:59,747 --> 01:26:02,022
Yes. I'm waiting for you to believe it.

1028
01:26:02,747 --> 01:26:06,823
Because, thanks to those
angels I found out about...

1029
01:26:06,858 --> 01:26:10,900
...the things your granny
said to you years ago.

1030
01:26:10,947 --> 01:26:17,546
Everyone makes their own luck. Your greatest
luck will be a man who loves you.

1031
01:26:19,067 --> 01:26:22,503
When you fel you are the
happiest woman in the world,

1032
01:26:23,787 --> 01:26:25,743
you will have found the man
you've been looking for.

1033
01:26:26,227 --> 01:26:30,698
That. How could you know that?

1034
01:26:33,067 --> 01:26:37,219
I've never told anyone that.
How did you find out?

1035
01:26:37,267 --> 01:26:38,780
Your luck is me.

1036
01:26:59,147 --> 01:27:01,024
FIVE YEARS later

1037
01:27:28,787 --> 01:27:32,257
Aha-a-a. How long has it been?
I've tried to talk him out of it.

1038
01:27:32,307 --> 01:27:34,752
For goodness sake, leave him alone Filiz.
Let the man eat.

1039
01:27:34,787 --> 01:27:39,497
No, this huge man will die of cholesterol.
I'm frightened of that.

1040
01:27:39,547 --> 01:27:40,662
It's nothing.

1041
01:27:41,267 --> 01:27:42,143
Yes, nothing.

1042
01:27:42,987 --> 01:27:43,817
Like your dad.

1043
01:27:45,027 --> 01:27:46,346
Uncle, not so fast.

1044
01:27:52,067 --> 01:27:53,625
D'you see what I see?

1045
01:27:54,587 --> 01:27:56,737
No, I cant. What dyou see?

1046
01:27:56,787 --> 01:27:57,617
Look.

1047
01:28:00,187 --> 01:28:02,178
What's the ice-man doing here?

1048
01:28:02,227 --> 01:28:03,580
I don't know, man.

1049
01:28:06,387 --> 01:28:09,747
I looked at the date of when
Filiz was going to die but...

1050
01:28:09,782 --> 01:28:13,103
...I didnt look at my own.
I might die too now.

1051
01:28:13,987 --> 01:28:16,899
Look at that guy dressed
like Nicholas Cage.

1052
01:28:16,947 --> 01:28:19,142
I hope he hasn't come to get me.

1053
01:28:19,187 --> 01:28:23,066
Don't say that, killer. Is this the time?
Turn round. Turn.

1054
01:28:32,587 --> 01:28:35,260
Ha! Ha! What?
What are you doing here?

1055
01:28:36,347 --> 01:28:37,257
I came to the party.

1056
01:28:37,307 --> 01:28:41,141
Oh good. Why?

1057
01:28:41,747 --> 01:28:46,821
Chief. After you left nobody
took your place.

1058
01:28:48,187 --> 01:28:51,782
I'm saying can you hand that over to me?
I'll take your place.

1059
01:28:53,987 --> 01:28:56,137
Of course, my dear.
Have what you want.

1060
01:28:56,787 --> 01:29:03,260
Of course. Take my hat. You can have
whatever you want. You can go now.

1061
01:29:06,747 --> 01:29:10,660
Darling, who's our guest?
Won't you introduce us?

1062
01:29:13,707 --> 01:29:15,060
C'mon do tell.

1063
01:29:15,107 --> 01:29:16,335
Hey, killer.

1064
01:29:20,147 --> 01:29:23,981
Err. Unal.

1065
01:29:25,907 --> 01:29:28,421
You know. I told you.

1066
01:29:31,747 --> 01:29:32,623
Unal.

1067
01:29:36,347 --> 01:29:39,976
Unal. Ebru.
Unal's gone.

1068
01:29:41,987 --> 01:29:42,817
That Unal?

1069
01:29:42,867 --> 01:29:46,303
O, that's Unal. He was a kid.
He's grown up now.

1070
01:29:46,347 --> 01:29:47,177
And me.
