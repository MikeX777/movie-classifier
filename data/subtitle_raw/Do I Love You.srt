2
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,485
You say that vessel does not belong to the Meltran?

3
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:14,449
Correct. During our previous battles, we found numerous objects...

4
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:18,328
...of Micron size in the wreckage of the enemy ships.

5
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,246
I shall show you.

6
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,834
Micron size.

7
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:29,422
Indeed, it seems these do not belong to Meltran.

8
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:31,341
Furthermore...

9
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,304
A number of our soldiers received strange sound signals near the enemy vessel...

10
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:40,600
...and became confused and unable to fight.

11
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,061
Unable to fight?!

12
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:47,148
What kind of power could they have aboard that ship?

13
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:26,354
MACROSS: DO YOU REMEMBER LOVE?

14
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,130
Check your A.S.K. and adjust it to the proper coordinates.

15
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,008
Delta-1 to ARMD-01.

16
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:59,346
Skull, Angel, and Apollo squadrons: Start your engines and standby to launch.

17
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,186
Thank you.

18
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,724
It is a love sign.

19
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:29,686
I love you, you love me.

20
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:40,030
But he has a crush on his plane.

21
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,491
Zoom, zoom. Zoom, zoom.

22
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:50,498
My boyfriend is a pilot.

23
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,764
Good evening, everyone!

24
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,224
I'm Lynn Minmay!

25
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:16,483
Tonight's my first concert...

26
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:20,528
...and I'd like thank everyone here for supporting me!

27
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,322
MINMAY!

28
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,323
Thank you.

29
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:29,371
It's been five months since our Macross left Earth.

30
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:36,461
During that time, many unhappy incidents have occurred.

31
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:44,803
But tonight, let's forget such sad things and enjoy ourselves!

32
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:54,729
And now, I'll sing a medley from my soon-to-be-released first album!

33
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:04,197
Remember, The silver wings that dance in the great sky.

34
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,949
Little white dragon.

35
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,536
Little white dragon.

36
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:16,751
Remember, The burning eyes that tore apart the darkness.

37
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,212
Little white dragon.

38
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,257
Little white dragon.

39
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:29,848
That man who came to seek the diseased city.

40
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:38,481
Evirus the Slayer! Slayer! Slayer!

41
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,026
Little white dragon.

42
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,929
Delta-1 to Skull, Angel, and Apollo squadrons:

43
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,600
Make a course correction to 308 + A15.

44
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,935
Enemy will be within firing range in 30 seconds.

45
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,270
Prepare to intercept.

46
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,359
Skull Leader to Squadron: You heard the lady.

47
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,195
Assume intercept formation 17.

48
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,196
Got it?!

49
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:26,905
Roger!

50
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,066
Got them!

51
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,694
Don't celebrate so soon.

52
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:09,155
Match their speed before firing at them. Now break formation and reverse thrust!

53
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,826
Roger!

54
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,833
3 of them?

55
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,625
All right.

56
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,049
Oh no!

57
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,143
Take them, Max!

58
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,852
Roger!

59
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,195
3 down...

60
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,530
Wow!

61
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,615
He's a real genius!

62
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,367
I can do that too!

63
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,050
Got them!

64
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:18,892
This is Delta-1.

65
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,728
A battleship just de-folded in Area 108, heading directly towards us!

66
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,564
Scanners detect a large number of incoming enemy battle pods!

67
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,857
Return immediately to intercept.

68
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,068
These battle pods were only decoys!

69
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,818
Delta-1 to Skull-11:

70
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,654
What do you think you're doing? You should be attacking the enemy ship!

71
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,572
Go to the coordinates I gave you!

72
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,949
Are you kidding?

73
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,118
I just saved your life! Is that the way to thank me?

74
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,912
Is that the way to speak to your superiors?

75
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,622
Follow my orders, rookie, or you'll be in the brig!

76
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,417
But they were going to blast you! I had to do something!

77
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,544
Let Defense Group 2 handle it! There's nothing to attack there!

78
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,712
That's an order!

79
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,630
No time for that!

80
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,966
I'm going after the pods that went into the ship.

81
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:35,427
Hold it!

82
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,139
Damn. Who does he think gives the orders here?

83
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,652
I wonder if we'll live thru the day?

84
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,155
It's more violent than ever today.

85
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:14,966
Minmay! Run!

86
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:18,553
What?

87
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,014
Zentran and Meltran!

88
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,182
Zentran and Meltran?

89
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,601
Zentran and Meltran in same place!

90
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,477
Unbelievable!

91
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,732
This is... Disgusting!

92
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,858
Gravity system #11 is malfunctioning!

93
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,610
Subsystem is also non-operational!

94
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,545
Course confirmed. Target locked on.

95
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,048
Energy level increasing. Main Guns, stand by.

96
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,306
FIRE!

97
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,441
It can't be?

98
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,492
Is it the real thing?

99
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,754
You're the one...?

100
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:40,630
Yes.

101
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,303
You rescued me, didn't you?

102
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:54,060
I... I'm Valkyrie Skull Squadron Pilot, Hikaru Ichijo... Ensign.

103
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,812
Thank you, Mr. Ensign.

104
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,481
No problem at all. I'm a big fan of you.

105
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,693
I'm pleased to meet you. Do you listen to my songs?

106
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,070
Y...Yes... All the time.

107
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,407
I guess everyone is worried.

108
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,662
So, Mr. Ensign, do you know where we...

109
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,414
Uh... could I have your autograph please?

110
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,248
What...? Oh, sure.

111
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,128
Here you are.

112
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:21,254
Thanks.

113
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,884
We fell into the engine block.

114
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,053
Is there any way out?

115
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:28,762
I'll go for a look.

116
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:36,478
I don't think there's any.

117
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,229
Can't you break down the wall?

118
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,066
That's impossible. It's made of hyper-carbon.

119
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,401
Just a sec...

120
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,529
There's too much static.

121
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,115
Can you use the plane's radio?

122
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,451
That's also damaged.

123
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:52,786
Oh.

124
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,622
Anybody?!

125
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,957
Is anybody out there?!

126
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,756
I guess not.

127
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,677
Well, that's OK.

128
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,640
I was tired of my over-booked schedule anyway.

129
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,560
At least I can relax now.

130
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,316
What's going on, Mr. Ensign?

131
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,611
Macross must be leaving Titan's orbit.

132
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,320
What?

133
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:28,988
Really.

134
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,376
The artificial gravity system is malfunctioning.

135
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:46,131
W...Wait, Miss Minmay! Don't move around so much!

136
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:46,840
No!

137
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,344
It was an accident!

138
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,804
A mistake!

139
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,015
Never mind! Do something!

140
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,853
Swing your legs forward and stop them slowly!

141
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,146
Like this?

142
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,401
Yeah, just move slowly.

143
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,820
This is fun.

144
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,159
Miss Minmay! Watch where you're going!

145
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:17,829
H...Hey!

146
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,667
Miss Minmay. Wait.

147
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,545
Damn, I forgot... I broke the flashlight.

148
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:34,429
Look. Look.

149
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:41,853
What do you think? I had it made just for the concert!

150
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,863
There's tuna and some vegetables floating around.

151
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,281
They must have been trapped here too.

152
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,744
Look, there's even a doll of me here.

153
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,333
Zero-G love, zero-G love!

154
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,419
Zero-G love, zero-G love!

155
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:12,717
On my way home from school with my boyfriend.

156
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:18,765
At the usual corner where we part...

157
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:23,937
Seeing no one's around...

158
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:30,652
He kissed me without warning.

159
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:40,286
I pretended to get angry at him... but...

160
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,581
My head dimmed, my heart pounded.

161
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,126
Zero-G love, zero-G love!

162
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,129
Four, three, two, one, zero-G love.

163
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:58,805
My body went floating away on the wind.

164
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:20,785
Our invasion troops report the unbelievable.

165
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:25,290
Microns exist inside the enemy vessel, as suspected.

166
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,125
Wait! Increase the magnification!

167
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,505
Those are Microns of Zentran and Meltran!

168
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:39,054
Yes. There's more evidence showing Zentran and Meltran in coexistence.

169
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,139
Disgusting!

170
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,392
I have a terrible premonition.

171
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:49,439
Our ancient combat manual says...

172
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:54,027
..."Do not interfere with Microns. Those who do will perish."

173
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:59,616
Perish?! Zentran's fleet will perish?!

174
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,703
Absurd.

175
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,753
Is this a Micron of a Micron?

176
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,475
It moves!

177
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,560
Get back!

178
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,562
Terrible sound!

179
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,939
Sound weapon!

180
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,107
Disgusting!

181
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:10,020
There's still no proof that they're dead.

182
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,979
Yes sir.

183
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:14,232
Let's try searching the western block today.

184
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,900
All right, good idea.

185
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,028
Excuse us.

186
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:22,032
That kid still hasn't been found yet, huh?

187
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:23,825
Well, he has been missing for three days now.

188
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,036
Maybe he got scared and deserted?

189
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,954
Have you considered that possibility?

190
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:28,788
Impossible.

191
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,874
He isn't the military type.

192
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:34,544
A boy will be unhappy all his life if he chooses the wrong job.

193
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:37,339
Well, what I mean is that he would probably do a lot better...

194
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,090
...if he chose another line of work.

195
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,301
You're always so critical about everything.

196
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,510
If you keep this up...

197
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,804
..."No one will ever want to marry me"?

198
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:47,724
That's all right.

199
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:51,686
Since I was a little girl, I've devoted myself to the service.

200
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:54,022
Not that again. Stop talking like an old maid.

201
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:55,774
But don't worry...

202
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:26,054
And then my mom and dad said...

203
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:29,516
"Don't you know how hard your brother works to take care of you?"

204
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:33,103
"If you don't behave, I'll disown you!"

205
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,189
So, I thanked them for taking care of me...

206
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:39,025
...and told them that I was going to work very hard...

207
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:42,362
...and one day become a famous singing star.

208
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:43,988
And then?

209
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:50,870
Then I left home and came here.

210
00:22:51,204 --> 00:22:52,205
That's great.

211
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:53,873
But...

212
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,877
I think I was too hard on them.

213
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,635
I just hope that mom and dad are all right.

214
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:07,762
Are they on Macross?

215
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:12,559
They're on Earth.

216
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:15,603
Earth, huh?

217
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:26,865
Do you know what's been happening on Earth?

218
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:30,869
The official word is heavy radio jamming prevents us from making contact.

219
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,039
I mean, the truth.

220
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,959
The Earth was bombarded so heavily...

221
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:40,295
...that I doubt anyone remained safe.

222
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,173
I see...

223
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,134
But don't worry.

224
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:49,429
We'll be back in Earth in only a month.

225
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:50,889
Oh.

226
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:56,478
By the way, could I ask you something?

227
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:57,062
What?

228
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,646
The other day, on TV...

229
00:23:58,646 --> 00:23:59,189
TV?

230
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,191
Yes. The TV show "For Nights When You Want to Cry."

231
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,610
There're rumors floating around about you and that other actor.

232
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,279
Did you believe those rumors?

233
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,615
They're only stories made up by the magazine publisher.

234
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:11,701
But... Is that true?

235
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:15,080
That love scene seemed so real.

236
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:18,708
Oh, come on...

237
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:24,964
I was only acting. It's business, you know.

238
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:26,341
No way!

239
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:28,677
Want me to show you?

240
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:29,636
Show me?

241
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:40,313
Oh, Hikaru...

242
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:47,237
I've loved you all my life.

243
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:50,281
Tell me you love me.

244
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:51,658
But...

245
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:55,745
You don't love me, do you?

246
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:58,248
Yes...yes, I do love you.

247
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:00,667
Do you, really?

248
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,836
Y...Yes, I do.

249
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:05,171
I'm so glad.

250
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:35,827
What a scoop!

251
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,296
Because you rescued Miss Minmay...

252
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:49,382
...the PR department told me to pardon you.

253
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:54,512
But any further disobedience of orders will lead to strict punishments.

254
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:55,847
Remember that.

255
00:25:58,183 --> 00:25:59,642
What, do you have a problem with that?

256
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:00,435
No.

257
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:03,480
From now on you had better watch your conduct. Clear?

258
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:06,232
Is that clear?

259
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,026
Yes Madam!

260
00:26:18,286 --> 00:26:19,913
Geez, is she really a woman?

261
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,257
You did it... you did it, Hikaru!

262
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,592
What's that, Senior?

263
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,761
You pick-up artist!

264
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,597
Boy, you did pretty good!

265
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:41,685
So, how did you enjoy our idol, Minmay?

266
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:42,268
Huh?

267
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,813
I didn't know you were such an unscrupulous character.

268
00:26:44,813 --> 00:26:46,398
So tell us what happened.

269
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:47,691
So tell us what happened.

270
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:49,526
I didn't do anything.

271
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:50,777
Liar!

272
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,946
Don't you actually think that we'll believe that?

273
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:54,572
You will have to accept the responsibilities.

274
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:57,158
But, I really didn't do anything at all.

275
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:58,284
Geez...

276
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:01,579
You didn't do anything to her in the 3 days you were alone with her?

277
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:02,288
Nothing.

278
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,416
What? And you still call yourself a man?

279
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:06,418
IDIOT!

280
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:14,592
"What was she doing with Valkyrie pilot Ichijo?"

281
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:15,969
"Has she outgrown her innocent girl image?"

282
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:19,097
Let me see... "Her mate was a pilot... a filthy relation?"

283
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:22,100
Just like I told you.

284
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,601
You're right.

285
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:26,312
No one's innocent anymore these days.

286
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:29,649
These movie stars are all the same.

287
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:31,484
I wonder what number he was?

288
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:36,114
How despicable, changing lovers like that.

289
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:39,451
You're actually jealous, aren't you?

290
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:40,118
Yeah.

291
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:41,119
I knew it.

292
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:45,206
But the truth is she doesn't understand anything.

293
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:45,915
That's right.

294
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:53,673
Minmay and Ichijo could have gotten out of the area...

295
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:56,676
...if they really tried to.

296
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:58,511
But they didn't.

297
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:01,639
Here lies the suspicion.

298
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:02,974
So why didn't they?

299
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,796
Commander, I've brought the patrol schedule chart for tomorrow.

300
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:36,716
Thanks. Why don't you have a drink with us before you go?

301
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:38,385
Well er...

302
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:39,761
It's okay. Come on, have a seat!

303
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:40,512
But...

304
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,223
I think I'll be going now.

305
00:28:43,223 --> 00:28:44,307
Huh?

306
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:45,517
I don't want to be a bother to you.

307
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:48,687
Come on Hikaru. Your superior's trying to make room for you.

308
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:50,105
Come on and sit down.

309
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:50,730
OK.

310
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:58,071
What's with this indifferent attitude, Hayase?

311
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:02,117
You should try to relax and act more like a woman when you're off duty.

312
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,411
A person's habits are not always easily changed.

313
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,415
You've got a point.

314
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:10,583
Look, Hayase...

315
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,752
...even though you graduated top of the class from the academy...

316
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:14,045
...you're also a woman.

317
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:18,842
Even if what a man does is wrong, it's sometimes important to pretend he's right.

318
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:21,553
Hey, Hikaru!

319
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:22,929
Yes sir!

320
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,431
You're a man, aren't you?

321
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:26,683
If you want a girl, you must be prepared to go after her.

322
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,686
Don't worry so much about hurting her feelings.

323
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:34,649
If you really love her... be aggressive. Make her your own.

324
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:35,650
Ok.

325
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,652
Uh, Roy. You've said enough.

326
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:41,531
I'll show you how a man and a woman are supposed to act.

327
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:43,825
Open your eyes and watch closely.

328
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:45,827
Roy!

329
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:50,498
See, they both look speechless.

330
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:51,791
Aww... that's all right.

331
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:52,584
Roy!

332
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:54,127
Roy!

333
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,423
Claudia...

334
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:01,634
Roy!

335
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:04,095
Excuse me...

336
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,223
There's a phone call for Mr. Ichijo.

337
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:08,224
For me?

338
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:09,893
From a member of your family.

339
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:11,019
Family?

340
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,983
Hello. This is Ichijo.

341
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:19,319
Really?

342
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:21,613
G...Got it.

343
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:22,989
I'll be right there.

344
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:23,948
Bye then...

345
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:25,575
What's up, Hikaru?

346
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:28,161
T...There's a sudden illness in my family.

347
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:29,454
Excuse me.

348
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:35,251
Family?

349
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:49,015
Sorry to keep you waiting.

350
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:51,017
Darn. You can recognize me?

351
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:54,312
I'd know you anywhere. I have all of your pictures.

352
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:56,856
And I tried so hard to disguise myself.

353
00:30:58,191 --> 00:30:59,526
Is it OK for you to be doing this?

354
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,445
Don't you want to be with me?

355
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:06,866
All right!

356
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:10,161
Tonight I'll take you out on the town!

357
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:12,205
Yeah.

358
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:06,861
I'm tired of it.

359
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:07,696
What?

360
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:10,448
My present life.

361
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:17,330
I suppose, if your dream is to become a star, you must endure a little.

362
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:32,303
It's so beautiful.

363
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:38,184
I wish I could go there.

364
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:56,745
But are you sure we can do this without permission?

365
00:33:57,579 --> 00:33:58,997
I'm going to show something wonderful!

366
00:33:58,997 --> 00:33:59,831
What?

367
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:00,582
Ready to go?

368
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,391
You can open your eyes now.

369
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:19,559
OK.

370
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:30,737
It's great.

371
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:32,197
It's the rainbow of Saturn.

372
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:34,366
Fantastic.

373
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:47,837
Britai 7018

374
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:48,588
Sir!

375
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,091
Your report has been analyzed.

376
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:53,551
Capture an enemy Micron as a specimen.

377
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,594
Understood!

378
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:59,015
What is he going to do with a Micron specimen?

379
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:02,435
Supreme Commander Boldoza must have a plan.

380
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:04,938
Report sir!

381
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:08,775
Reconnaissance reports appearance of a single Meltran vessel...

382
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:10,777
...crossing the primary warning line.

383
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:11,611
What?

384
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:12,987
How shall we respond?

385
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:15,824
Reinforce our defenses.

386
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:18,785
Do not let the Meltran near us.

387
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:19,369
Understood!

388
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:21,371
If we do not act quickly...

389
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:23,415
...it is possible that Meltran will succeed before us.

390
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:26,793
Understood. Begin the Micron capture operation immediately.

391
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:31,756
You walk indifferently ahead.

392
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:35,635
I follow you with a sulking face.

393
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:46,479
The shiny white beach goes on forever.

394
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:53,153
You say I love him...

395
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:57,699
But I love you more.

396
00:35:57,949 --> 00:36:03,580
Always together on Sunset Beach...

397
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:10,128
Ocean breeze, big wave.

398
00:36:20,347 --> 01:12:38,525
The one who's starting to occupy my heart...

399
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:25,435
Jumps around merrily.

400
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:33,109
Surf, sun, pendant.

401
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:34,611
Sunset...

402
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,866
No use hiding, Miss Minmay.

403
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,287
I'm sorry...

404
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:45,955
Lieutenant...

405
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:47,582
I'm amazed!

406
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,709
Using a Valkyrie for a personal trip?

407
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:54,923
It isn't Hikaru's fault. I asked him to take me!

408
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:57,008
Minmay! Come back immediately!

409
00:36:57,008 --> 00:36:57,842
Brother...!

410
00:36:57,842 --> 00:36:58,927
Ichijo!

411
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:03,181
If the media ever find out about this, it would be the end of her career!

412
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:07,769
The senior officers aren't going to excuse your behavior this time.

413
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:10,897
I understand. I'll accept my punishment.

414
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:12,482
What a soldier.

415
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:13,733
Now hurry and get back to the ship!

416
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:15,568
Yes sir.

417
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:16,903
Let's go home.

418
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:17,779
OK.

419
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:21,324
Oh, No!

420
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:27,914
An enemy attack!

421
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:29,416
I know!

422
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,251
Do something!

423
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:34,254
This is Lieutenant Hayase. Relay an emergency message to Commander Fokker.

424
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:38,383
Hikaru...

425
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:39,426
Don't worry.

426
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:40,343
I'll take care of them.

427
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,686
Oh no, I forgot this is a training plane!

428
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:50,270
WHAT...?

429
00:37:57,777 --> 00:37:58,361
That's strange...

430
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,280
I wonder why they don't fire?

431
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:11,207
Dammit, stop teasing us!

432
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:20,008
Hey, Hikaru!

433
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:22,927
In trouble again, eh?

434
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:25,180
Senior!

435
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:28,683
But you did the right thing...

436
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:32,312
...you need to be aggressive like this to win that girl, you know.

437
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:36,107
Senior! You're drunk!

438
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:37,442
Idiot!

439
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:40,403
How can you fight a war if you can't handle some booze?

440
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:54,000
Great!

441
00:39:00,173 --> 00:39:00,965
Oh no.

442
00:39:01,591 --> 00:39:03,426
Yahoooo!

443
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:15,397
Did you see that, Hikaru?!

444
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:17,774
Oh no.

445
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:28,201
This is really bad.

446
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:12,746
What are they?

447
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:17,167
Your language is being translated.

448
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:19,127
Answer our questions.

449
00:40:20,795 --> 00:40:25,008
How can male and female Microns co-exist?

450
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:27,093
Male and female Microns...?

451
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,386
What's this...

452
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:30,347
I wonder what they're after?

453
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:34,726
We have already found that Men and Women coexist on your ship.

454
00:40:35,852 --> 00:40:37,437
What's the use in finding that out?

455
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:40,315
It seems their culture is different from ours.

456
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:45,278
Why don't you fight? Why did you become Microns?

457
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:50,950
Just as you are born giants we are born this way.

458
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,243
It's not something we choose.

459
00:40:53,036 --> 00:40:54,037
"Born"?

460
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,998
Does "born" mean manufactured?

461
00:40:57,415 --> 00:40:58,375
Manufactured?

462
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:00,418
Is that not correct?

463
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:04,130
Sort of. Man and woman cooperate to create.

464
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:06,800
Man and Woman cooperate?

465
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:08,259
Unbelievable!

466
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:09,886
Why do you not fight?

467
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:12,514
Are you kidding?

468
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:15,934
It's far better to hug a woman than to fight her.

469
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:18,436
"Hug"?

470
00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:19,813
Show us what "hug" is.

471
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:21,606
This is a hug.

472
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:25,985
What do you think you are doing?

473
00:41:25,985 --> 00:41:29,447
Do Man and Woman of your kind always do such terrible things?

474
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:31,991
Yes.. with kisses and everything else included.

475
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:32,826
"Kiss"?

476
00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:34,953
Show us what "kiss" is.

477
00:41:35,328 --> 00:41:36,329
Well...That is...

478
00:41:44,295 --> 00:41:44,587
Minmay!

479
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:45,839
What are you doing?!

480
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:51,386
Show us what "kiss" is.

481
00:41:59,352 --> 00:42:00,729
I'll kiss her! Let her go.

482
00:42:01,146 --> 00:42:02,689
Very well.

483
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,696
Quick, act it out, or they'll kill us.

484
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:20,665
"KISS"!

485
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:39,392
Minmay...

486
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:42,187
Hikaru...

487
00:42:46,566 --> 00:42:47,192
Minmay...

488
00:42:48,485 --> 00:42:51,279
Imagine that...they freaked out when they saw a kiss.

489
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,407
It would appear that their men fight against their women.

490
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:05,543
Now's our chance. Everyone OK?

491
00:43:05,543 --> 00:43:06,211
Yes.

492
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:07,420
Barely!

493
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:10,799
A Meltran invasion!

494
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:13,343
3 Microns have escaped in the confusion!

495
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:16,971
Put the ship on full alert!

496
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:20,475
Annihilate the enemy and recapture the Microns.

497
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,231
Pardon, Britai...

498
00:43:26,981 --> 00:43:31,444
We still have two Microns in detention.

499
00:43:31,444 --> 00:43:33,154
We must take them to Supreme Commander Boldoza.

500
00:43:37,992 --> 00:43:38,785
We found them!

501
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:39,494
Yeah.

502
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:50,380
Hikaru! Kiss her!

503
00:43:51,214 --> 00:43:52,590
What? Oh yeah. Sorry.

504
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:02,600
So cruel.

505
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,060
Hurry! Start the engines!

506
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,645
I know.

507
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:10,150
I have to rescue Minmay.

508
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:49,856
Weaklings...

509
00:45:27,018 --> 00:45:30,730
Disappointing. Can't anyone match my fighting skill?

510
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:38,071
Wow...

511
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:56,631
It's a woman.

512
00:45:56,631 --> 00:45:58,675
Men and women are fighting!

513
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:00,593
What's going on?

514
00:46:00,593 --> 00:46:01,302
Hikaru!

515
00:46:01,302 --> 00:46:02,929
Now's our chance to get out of here.

516
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:03,722
Right.

517
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:15,108
You will not escape, Micron!

518
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:22,032
Oh yeah?

519
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:36,212
SENIOR!

520
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:39,132
Get out of here! Go rescue Minmay!

521
00:46:39,132 --> 00:46:40,800
If you say so...?

522
00:47:00,028 --> 00:47:01,738
Hikaru...

523
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:04,783
Tell Claudia goodbye for me...

524
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:15,377
SENIOR!

525
00:47:15,377 --> 00:47:16,503
Don't go.

526
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:18,046
Don't waste the opportunity his death gave us.

527
00:47:18,046 --> 00:47:19,089
What?! You cold-hearted...

528
00:47:25,845 --> 00:47:30,892
Minmay has a homing device. Follow its signal.

529
00:47:30,892 --> 00:47:32,018
Roger.

530
00:47:37,065 --> 00:47:38,191
Energy level rising.

531
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:40,694
Flagship coordinates calculations complete.

532
00:47:42,278 --> 00:47:44,364
Long-range fold, stand by.

533
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:54,332
Minmay!

534
00:47:55,166 --> 00:47:55,834
Hikaru!

535
00:47:56,543 --> 00:47:58,378
It's Hikaru! He's come for us!

536
00:48:11,766 --> 00:48:12,308
This is the...

537
00:48:12,308 --> 00:48:14,894
A Fold! This ship's going to fold!

538
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:22,610
Minmay!

539
00:48:23,194 --> 00:48:23,903
Hikaru!

540
00:48:28,033 --> 00:48:28,533
Hikaru.

541
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:29,534
Hikaru.

542
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:20,543
Minmay...

543
00:49:26,091 --> 00:49:26,633
Where are we?

544
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:28,218
How should I know?

545
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:30,470
And the enemy vessel?

546
00:49:31,054 --> 00:49:32,305
No sign of it.

547
00:49:32,931 --> 00:49:33,473
I see.

548
00:49:36,976 --> 00:49:39,562
In any case, we're on a creepy planet.

549
00:49:41,523 --> 00:49:44,401
That looks like an ocean! Can you fly us out that way?

550
00:49:45,985 --> 00:49:47,320
What's the point?

551
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:47,987
What?

552
00:49:48,863 --> 00:49:50,990
Going there won't reunite me with Minmay.

553
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:52,033
What are you saying?

554
00:49:54,035 --> 00:49:55,745
Minmay will probably be killed.

555
00:49:56,663 --> 00:49:57,831
Just like Senior was.

556
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,961
If I hadn't take her out, this never would have happened.

557
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:06,423
But it's our duty to find where we are.

558
00:50:07,424 --> 00:50:08,842
Duty! Duty!

559
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:10,635
Is that all you ever think about?

560
00:50:11,636 --> 00:50:13,013
I understand.

561
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:14,097
I'll do it myself.

562
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:16,349
W...Wait, Lieutenant...

563
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:37,287
That was extremely stupid!

564
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:54,888
This is...

565
00:50:58,016 --> 00:51:03,229
United Navy...Pacific Fleet... Offensive Aircraft Carrier...

566
00:51:04,481 --> 00:51:05,482
The Prometheus.

567
00:51:06,274 --> 00:51:06,983
How could it be?

568
00:51:08,234 --> 00:51:08,902
This...

569
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:12,280
This is our Earth!

570
00:52:06,793 --> 00:52:13,091
When the bell tolls at the midnight hour...

571
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:20,765
...the magic will disappear.

572
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:28,523
At the top of the stairs...

573
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:36,281
...is a pair of glass slippers.

574
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:44,330
Like Cinderella's love affair...

575
00:52:45,457 --> 00:52:51,671
...mine's all controlled by the clock.

576
00:52:53,340 --> 00:53:00,347
Everything that can tell the time...

577
00:53:01,848 --> 00:53:04,601
Please stop...

578
00:53:05,435 --> 00:53:09,522
...until day breaks.

579
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:12,692
Please stop...

580
00:53:13,818 --> 00:53:21,034
...until day breaks.

581
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:31,753
Protoculture.

582
00:53:31,753 --> 00:53:33,546
Protoculture?

583
00:53:33,546 --> 00:53:37,801
The Micron's Culture is called Protoculture.

584
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:39,052
"Culture"?

585
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:43,390
Even I do not know much, except that it means:

586
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:46,059
"Creative activity that is not fighting."

587
00:53:47,727 --> 00:53:51,815
Our Creators did not teach me anything about "Culture"...

588
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:54,567
...except for our programming...

589
00:53:55,068 --> 00:53:59,239
"Never become involved with Culture."

590
00:53:59,989 --> 00:54:03,368
That terrible sound is "Culture"?

591
00:54:03,368 --> 00:54:06,037
That is "Song".

592
00:54:06,037 --> 00:54:07,539
"Song"?

593
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:10,417
I am a Mobile Fortress that has endured...

594
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:13,253
120,000 cycles since my Creation.

595
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:17,549
In my many battles, I have not learned much of the "Culture" of Protoculture.

596
00:54:17,549 --> 00:54:20,593
Except that "culture" can be very powerful.

597
00:54:22,762 --> 00:54:27,058
This "song" may have the power to bring Meltran and Zentran together.

598
00:54:27,058 --> 00:54:28,601
Such power?

599
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:31,271
Power that deprives us of our will to fight?

600
00:54:32,105 --> 00:54:32,772
Yes.

601
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:51,958
What's this?

602
00:54:52,584 --> 00:54:56,296
A "Fragment of Culture" that was captured a long time ago.

603
00:54:56,296 --> 00:54:58,465
"Fragment of Culture"?

604
00:54:58,465 --> 00:55:03,678
The two Protocultures may know what this "Fragment of Culture" is.

605
00:55:38,505 --> 00:55:40,340
Tokyo was also destroyed.

606
00:55:42,842 --> 00:55:45,595
The United Forces HQ at Alaska Base was buried in lava.

607
00:55:46,137 --> 00:55:49,474
We haven't found one single survivor in a whole week.

608
00:55:53,144 --> 00:55:55,689
So, where to now, Lt. Hayase?

609
00:55:56,147 --> 00:55:58,566
London? Or maybe Paris?

610
00:55:59,401 --> 00:56:00,527
How about New York?

611
00:56:00,902 --> 00:56:01,945
Just give me your orders.

612
00:56:02,362 --> 00:56:03,071
Stop it!

613
00:56:04,864 --> 00:56:06,116
Please stop.

614
00:56:35,103 --> 00:56:36,604
Here, it's cooked.

615
00:56:42,235 --> 00:56:44,070
You haven't eaten a thing in 3 days.

616
00:56:44,446 --> 00:56:45,572
At least eat a little.

617
00:56:46,948 --> 00:56:49,993
I would rather die before I eat that.

618
00:56:50,785 --> 00:56:52,746
I put the anti-radiation drug in the recipe.

619
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:54,414
So, a little bite of this won't hurt.

620
00:56:58,001 --> 00:57:00,879
Survival is also a soldier's duty.

621
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:02,672
It doesn't matter anymore.

622
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:08,553
But we finally made it back to Earth.

623
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:13,433
And if Macross is safe, it'll be here soon.

624
00:57:14,476 --> 00:57:14,934
Here...

625
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:18,021
Don't you understand?

626
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:22,150
Macross can't do anything even if it does get here.

627
00:57:22,442 --> 00:57:23,109
Why?

628
00:57:24,194 --> 00:57:26,363
There is no one left on Earth!

629
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,199
The people on Macross are still alive.

630
00:57:29,616 --> 00:57:31,242
Earth is totally lifeless...

631
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:35,330
10 billion people were annihilated in just a few seconds.

632
00:57:50,136 --> 00:57:51,429
How pathetic...

633
00:57:52,972 --> 00:57:55,475
To be an officer of an army whose defeat is obvious.

634
00:57:58,728 --> 00:58:01,481
But you're much tougher than I.

635
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:05,985
Commander Fokker told me...

636
00:58:06,695 --> 00:58:07,612
Senior...?

637
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:11,241
That you don't have a family.

638
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:14,911
Your mother died when you were very young...

639
00:58:15,328 --> 00:58:16,913
...and your father died in an accident.

640
00:58:18,498 --> 00:58:20,875
He screwed up during an acrobatic maneuver.

641
00:58:21,418 --> 00:58:22,961
"Zoom - splat." See.

642
00:58:26,506 --> 00:58:29,968
So, you've lived by yourself until now?

643
00:58:30,343 --> 00:58:31,886
I've just been an air race prize hunter.

644
00:58:32,762 --> 00:58:35,515
I've flown planes since I was small.

645
00:58:38,601 --> 00:58:41,730
But that's why you're holding up.

646
00:58:43,815 --> 00:58:45,025
But not me.

647
00:58:46,067 --> 00:58:48,236
I thought I was a soldier...

648
00:58:48,236 --> 00:58:51,781
...who'd struggle for survival even if I were the last one left.

649
00:58:52,323 --> 00:58:53,324
But look at me now.

650
00:59:05,378 --> 00:59:07,130
I'm sorry...I...

651
00:59:40,246 --> 00:59:42,415
What's that column over there?

652
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:44,334
Let's check it out.

653
01:00:02,435 --> 01:00:05,730
It looks like it sunk a very long time ago.

654
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:07,107
Yeah.

655
01:00:08,608 --> 01:00:10,610
It seems deserted.

656
01:00:11,027 --> 01:00:13,697
But it looks like some of the devices are still working.

657
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:22,247
They're made for our size.

658
01:00:22,872 --> 01:00:24,457
If it doesn't belong to the giants, then who...?

659
01:00:26,626 --> 01:00:27,293
This is...

660
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:28,920
A fold communications system...

661
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,047
A fold communication?

662
01:00:32,716 --> 01:00:33,591
It still works!

663
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,302
Maybe we can contact Macross with it.

664
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:40,807
But it'll be bad if the enemy intercepts our call.

665
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:43,393
I know, but we have to give it a try.

666
01:00:45,145 --> 01:00:48,148
If Macross hasn't been destroyed, they'll answer.

667
01:00:53,903 --> 01:00:54,821
No response.

668
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:58,408
It's probably damaged.

669
01:01:01,202 --> 01:01:03,329
Maybe we pushed the wrong buttons.

670
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:07,542
Let's try the other ones.

671
01:01:25,643 --> 01:01:26,853
"We have been waiting"?

672
01:01:27,437 --> 01:01:28,813
Waiting for us?

673
01:01:28,813 --> 01:01:29,856
You can understand it?

674
01:01:29,856 --> 01:01:31,358
Yes...a little.

675
01:01:31,816 --> 01:01:33,360
Who are you?

676
01:01:37,572 --> 01:01:40,075
"The colonization vessel's central computer"?

677
01:01:42,702 --> 01:01:45,789
No, we are people of this planet.

678
01:01:50,293 --> 01:01:51,586
Genetic manipulation?

679
01:02:11,898 --> 01:02:12,607
It disappeared.

680
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:15,443
Wait!

681
01:02:15,443 --> 01:02:17,028
I still have some more questions!

682
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:21,408
It's diverting it's energy...

683
01:02:21,908 --> 01:02:23,493
What did it say?

684
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:28,081
It's using the last of it's energy to raise the city.

685
01:02:28,707 --> 01:02:30,041
Raise the city?

686
01:02:30,041 --> 01:02:30,583
Yes.

687
01:02:34,045 --> 01:02:34,713
We're moving!

688
01:02:44,014 --> 01:02:45,432
Long ago...

689
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:49,477
...there was an interstellar civilization called Protoculture.

690
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:53,690
They were advanced in genetic engineering. Eventually...

691
01:02:54,232 --> 01:03:00,447
...the men and women were able to reproduce themselves on their own.

692
01:03:01,781 --> 01:03:04,993
The males separated to become the Zentradi...

693
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:08,371
...and the females became the Meltrandi.

694
01:03:08,371 --> 01:03:10,248
The two groups started wars against each other.

695
01:03:11,249 --> 01:03:12,709
That's when they created the giants...

696
01:03:13,376 --> 01:03:16,588
...who only knew how to fight?

697
01:03:20,175 --> 01:03:23,803
But when the giants' fighting became too intense...

698
01:03:24,262 --> 01:03:26,556
...and they realized at last, their mistake...

699
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:28,600
...sought to start over...

700
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:33,063
...with men and women in co-existence.

701
01:03:34,189 --> 01:03:36,524
So, they took refuge here on Earth.

702
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:47,619
After they arrived on Earth, they manipulated the genes...

703
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:49,704
...of the indigenous creatures to create our ancestors.

704
01:03:50,997 --> 01:03:52,123
They created our ancestors...?

705
01:03:52,123 --> 01:03:53,249
Yes.

706
01:03:55,835 --> 01:03:56,711
I see...

707
01:03:58,171 --> 01:04:00,048
Where did the people of this city go?

708
01:04:01,549 --> 01:04:06,680
20,000 years ago the giants' fighting reached this solar system.

709
01:04:07,013 --> 01:04:09,015
They sunk this city to hide it...

710
01:04:09,015 --> 01:04:11,518
...and temporarily left the Earth.

711
01:04:12,644 --> 01:04:15,188
But they never returned?

712
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:16,606
Right.

713
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:25,490
So, the computer mistook the Zentradi attack 6 months ago as their return.

714
01:04:26,282 --> 01:04:28,326
...and raised the city?

715
01:04:29,035 --> 01:04:33,873
So that we could live here in this city.

716
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:40,380
But after waiting 20,000 years, we're the only ones to return.

717
01:04:43,591 --> 01:04:45,802
True...

718
01:04:54,769 --> 01:04:55,895
Everything seems to be in ruins.

719
01:04:56,646 --> 01:04:57,230
Yeah.

720
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:03,945
This is...

721
01:05:06,865 --> 01:05:08,033
I wonder what this could be?

722
01:05:08,783 --> 01:05:09,743
Did you find something?

723
01:05:09,743 --> 01:05:11,494
There appears to be some kind of writing on it.

724
01:05:13,288 --> 01:05:14,205
"Remember..."

725
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:16,291
"...remembering..."

726
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:18,168
"...do you remember...?"

727
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:22,922
I can't understand it that well. The language is more complex than the giants'.

728
01:05:23,423 --> 01:05:23,965
I see.

729
01:05:34,017 --> 01:05:35,477
This looks like it's just an ordinary house.

730
01:05:36,644 --> 01:05:37,854
Let's go look somewhere else.

731
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:40,565
Huh?

732
01:05:41,274 --> 01:05:43,276
I don't really have a reason, but...

733
01:05:44,652 --> 01:05:46,112
I just want to...

734
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:48,073
I see.

735
01:05:48,948 --> 01:05:51,201
Well, I'll just go have a look around.

736
01:05:53,536 --> 01:05:54,996
I'll be right back.

737
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:17,268
Some things never change.

738
01:06:47,924 --> 01:06:49,634
No one's here, as you'd expect...

739
01:06:50,468 --> 01:06:52,345
...and all the machines are useless.

740
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:01,521
Welcome home.

741
01:07:03,148 --> 01:07:04,065
I...I'm back...

742
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:08,028
So, shall we eat?

743
01:07:24,336 --> 01:07:25,545
OK.

744
01:07:28,548 --> 01:07:29,215
Please sit down.

745
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:12,717
I want to go home.

746
01:08:15,095 --> 01:08:16,262
Where everyone is...

747
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:31,277
Ichijo...

748
01:09:15,155 --> 01:09:16,656
Is it starting to move again?

749
01:09:16,656 --> 01:09:19,325
No, this sound is coming from the sky.

750
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:20,201
The sky?

751
01:09:41,097 --> 01:09:42,140
Macross!

752
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,185
Our transmission did reach them!

753
01:09:45,643 --> 01:09:46,227
Yeah.

754
01:09:55,862 --> 01:09:59,115
Misa Hayase and Hikaru Ichijo, reporting for duty, sir!

755
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:10,377
It's good to have you back.

756
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:12,962
What's the situation on Earth?

757
01:10:13,463 --> 01:10:14,005
Yes sir.

758
01:10:15,924 --> 01:10:17,509
During the period of a month...

759
01:10:17,509 --> 01:10:22,222
we searched 15,000 kilometers of ground and this alien city...

760
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:25,350
...but found no survivors.

761
01:10:27,185 --> 01:10:28,144
I see.

762
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:31,564
I'll have a detailed report later.

763
01:10:32,732 --> 01:10:34,734
For now, I suggest that you two get some well deserved rest.

764
01:10:34,734 --> 01:10:35,819
Yes, sir.

765
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:59,426
Did Roy...die gloriously?

766
01:11:00,552 --> 01:11:01,011
Yes.

767
01:11:04,723 --> 01:11:05,598
Thank you.

768
01:11:06,683 --> 01:11:08,101
That's all I wanted to know.

769
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:53,980
Minmay...

770
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:01,738
It's strange, isn't it?

771
01:12:02,614 --> 01:12:04,908
Minmay is somewhere so far away...

772
01:12:06,368 --> 01:12:08,453
...and yet we can still hear her songs.

773
01:12:09,913 --> 01:12:11,206
...her songs.

774
01:12:15,335 --> 01:12:17,754
As though she were still alive.

775
01:12:18,672 --> 01:12:19,089
Yeah.

776
01:12:21,174 --> 01:12:23,093
It's nostalgic.

777
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:25,220
Nostalgic...?

778
01:12:29,182 --> 01:12:34,938
It's only been a month since the time I took Minmay out into space...

779
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:38,149
...but it seems as if it was such a long time ago.

780
01:12:38,483 --> 01:12:40,694
True.

781
01:12:40,694 --> 01:12:44,864
The night makes the Gypsy violin cry.

782
01:12:44,864 --> 01:12:49,494
A wine bottle and two glasses.

783
01:12:49,494 --> 01:12:54,416
But my burning passion has nowhere to go.

784
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:57,252
Tonight I toast myself, in my loneliness.

785
01:13:04,592 --> 01:13:06,136
Miria 639

786
01:13:06,845 --> 01:13:08,680
Yes, Moruk Lapramiz.

787
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:13,852
The "Fragment of Culture" must be in the Protoculture ruin.

788
01:13:15,478 --> 01:13:18,273
For our victory, seize control of this ruin.

789
01:13:19,232 --> 01:13:21,818
Madam...I swear by the pride of Meltran, I shall not fail.

790
01:13:30,118 --> 01:13:33,788
Enemy fighters approaching at sea level, heading 027 degrees.

791
01:13:34,247 --> 01:13:36,791
We believe they are the all-female Meltrandi.

792
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:39,419
Only women? That sounds good.

793
01:13:39,794 --> 01:13:41,588
They may be women, but don't underestimate them!

794
01:13:41,963 --> 01:13:44,758
They might even be tougher that the Zentradi!

795
01:13:45,842 --> 01:13:46,968
That's interesting.

796
01:13:47,552 --> 01:13:48,511
Interesting?

797
01:13:48,928 --> 01:13:50,347
What's the matter, Junior Lieutenant Ichijo?

798
01:13:50,638 --> 01:13:52,682
You're acting like a chicken.

799
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:53,600
What?

800
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:55,769
Commander Max is right.

801
01:13:56,144 --> 01:13:58,438
Maybe it's because he has a woman now.

802
01:14:00,982 --> 01:14:01,691
Kakizaki!

803
01:14:05,987 --> 01:14:07,739
So much for Protoculture.

804
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,510
Damm!

805
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:29,427
Missed!

806
01:14:31,179 --> 01:14:31,846
Impossible!

807
01:14:38,019 --> 01:14:38,812
Oh no!

808
01:14:51,783 --> 01:14:52,951
This is unbelievable!

809
01:14:55,787 --> 01:14:56,913
I won't let you escape!

810
01:14:59,124 --> 01:14:59,874
A battleship!

811
01:16:15,033 --> 01:16:16,618
Dammit, at this rate...

812
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:25,001
Minmay...?

813
01:16:28,505 --> 01:16:29,756
What is this...?

814
01:16:29,756 --> 01:16:30,840
Where's that singing coming from?

815
01:16:31,424 --> 01:16:33,593
How can it be...? Minmay...?

816
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:55,699
Beautiful.

817
01:16:58,952 --> 01:17:00,537
Beautiful...?

818
01:17:07,043 --> 01:17:08,461
Meltran's fighting efficiency is dropping!

819
01:17:08,461 --> 01:17:10,630
What?! It's not possible!

820
01:17:11,256 --> 01:17:13,133
Is this the "Power of Culture"?

821
01:17:32,485 --> 01:17:35,697
It is a success. Meltran has retreated.

822
01:17:35,697 --> 01:17:36,656
Good.

823
01:17:36,656 --> 01:17:41,244
If we can augment this "Song" what Minmay calls thy "Lyrics"...

824
01:17:41,244 --> 01:17:43,955
...then we will be able to make Meltran surrender.

825
01:17:55,175 --> 01:17:56,092
Captain...

826
01:17:56,092 --> 01:17:58,887
The Zentradi are proposing peace talks.

827
01:17:59,846 --> 01:18:01,181
Peace talks?

828
01:18:33,046 --> 01:18:37,425
Captain Gloval will now make his official announcement.

829
01:18:46,851 --> 01:18:55,443
Effectively September 11, 11:00am, U.N. SPACY SDF-1 Macross...

830
01:18:55,443 --> 01:19:00,657
...and the Zentradi 425th Bodol Fleet...

831
01:19:00,657 --> 01:19:03,076
...have agreed to peace.

832
01:19:12,335 --> 01:19:15,714
And now, as a result of investigating this alien city...

833
01:19:15,714 --> 01:19:19,259
...we have found that the aliens who build it were the descendants...

834
01:19:20,385 --> 01:19:23,555
...of a highly advanced interstellar civilization called Protoculture...

835
01:19:23,555 --> 01:19:28,810
...that prospered over 500,000 years ago.

836
01:19:28,810 --> 01:19:39,904
Originally, we humans, the Zentradi and their enemy the Meltrandi...

837
01:19:39,904 --> 01:19:47,787
...all had the same genetic structure as the Protoculture's.

838
01:19:52,208 --> 01:20:00,633
We were created by the protoculture's advanced genetic science.

839
01:20:01,593 --> 01:20:02,844
Please observe.

840
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:13,063
By utilizing the Protoculture's genetic engineering techniques...

841
01:20:13,063 --> 01:20:15,648
...it is possible to change Zentradi back into humans.

842
01:20:18,151 --> 01:20:20,779
These three gentlemen sitting with us now...

843
01:20:20,779 --> 01:20:24,157
...are the Zentradi soldiers you have just seen.

844
01:20:28,787 --> 01:20:32,707
They are a warrior race that knows nothing of culture.

845
01:20:32,707 --> 01:20:36,419
They are split into two forces, the males and the females...

846
01:20:36,419 --> 01:20:39,172
...and have been fighting each other for over 500,000 years.

847
01:20:39,631 --> 01:20:42,008
I thought we were forbidden to receive...

848
01:20:42,008 --> 01:20:45,387
...the Protoculture's broadcasting until the operation succeeds.

849
01:20:46,846 --> 01:20:47,847
What is it?

850
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,725
Can you see those three?

851
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:55,355
The three Microns we sent to make peace with the Earthlings?

852
01:20:55,355 --> 01:20:56,231
What about them?

853
01:20:58,191 --> 01:21:03,238
I, Britai, have never seen a Zentran so full of Culture.

854
01:21:08,868 --> 01:21:12,080
I wish I could become a Micron.

855
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,832
That's disgusting!

856
01:21:16,543 --> 01:21:17,711
I am just joking with you.

857
01:21:17,711 --> 01:21:19,379
"Joking"?

858
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:20,922
Do you not know?

859
01:21:20,922 --> 01:21:21,631
No, I don't.

860
01:21:22,882 --> 01:21:26,011
Minmay, the Protoculture taught me.

861
01:21:26,011 --> 01:21:28,513
I think it means "I am lying."

862
01:21:29,514 --> 01:21:30,765
Unbelievable!

863
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:35,937
And now, may I introduce the Galaxy's greatest superstar...

864
01:21:35,937 --> 01:21:38,481
Lynn Minmay!

865
01:21:51,953 --> 01:21:54,497
This melody you hear now...

866
01:21:54,497 --> 01:21:59,586
...comes from an ancient Zentradi memory plate we decoded.

867
01:22:00,545 --> 01:22:07,510
Unfortunately their memory plate did not have the lyrics recorded.

868
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:11,598
So, our song-writers on Macross...

869
01:22:11,598 --> 01:22:15,352
...are writing wonderful lyrics to this melody right now.

870
01:22:15,894 --> 01:22:18,396
And I wish to broadcast this song to the universe...

871
01:22:18,396 --> 01:22:20,273
...so that we can negotiate for peace with the Meltrandi...

872
01:22:20,273 --> 01:22:24,778
...and establish a warless, peaceful world.

873
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:37,123
We can take this first step toward peace...

874
01:22:37,123 --> 01:22:40,960
...because of countless sacrifices people have made in the past.

875
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,214
We have all suffered through many unhappy times.

876
01:22:44,214 --> 01:22:47,634
All of a sudden, many of our young people were forced into this war.

877
01:22:47,634 --> 01:22:51,137
Some became prisoners of war.

878
01:22:51,137 --> 01:22:54,140
And many others have lost their lives.

879
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:56,976
Now, hoping for a reunion of joyful tears...

880
01:22:56,976 --> 01:23:01,439
...Lynn Minmay waits for some special people.

881
01:23:01,773 --> 01:23:05,819
Chief Operator of our Forces, Commander Hayase...

882
01:23:05,819 --> 01:23:10,865
...and Valkyrie Skull Squadron pilot Lieutenant Ichijo.

883
01:23:27,132 --> 01:23:28,008
Hikaru.

884
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:35,515
Minmay.

885
01:23:38,643 --> 01:23:41,021
Hikaru!

886
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:48,570
Hikaru! Hikaru!

887
01:23:59,164 --> 01:24:01,166
Hikaru!

888
01:24:21,269 --> 01:24:23,730
"Girl in love"? "Season for dreams"?

889
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:25,565
None are good.

890
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:38,912
"Do you remember..."

891
01:24:38,912 --> 01:24:40,413
"...eye to eye..."

892
01:24:44,959 --> 01:24:47,921
"Do you remember..."

893
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:50,715
"When our eyes met..."

894
01:24:53,343 --> 01:24:54,761
Could this be...?

895
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:10,110
Coming!

896
01:25:19,285 --> 01:25:20,203
Minmay!

897
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:42,976
You're very busy now, I suppose.

898
01:25:43,768 --> 01:25:45,854
By the way, is the melody to the song finished...

899
01:25:47,522 --> 01:25:48,148
Minmay!

900
01:25:51,484 --> 01:25:52,402
I love you.

901
01:25:56,573 --> 01:26:00,201
I don't know what happened on that island between you and that woman...

902
01:26:01,119 --> 01:26:01,578
...but...

903
01:26:02,037 --> 01:26:02,996
...but still...

904
01:26:04,539 --> 01:26:06,458
I still love you.

905
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:25,602
Minmay...

906
01:26:26,311 --> 01:26:26,936
I...

907
01:26:45,246 --> 01:26:46,122
Commander!

908
01:26:51,294 --> 01:26:52,212
What's this?

909
01:26:53,046 --> 01:26:53,963
What do you mean?

910
01:26:55,465 --> 01:26:57,050
Do you remember this?

911
01:26:57,425 --> 01:26:59,177
Uhh... Yes.

912
01:27:00,053 --> 01:27:02,472
This is the plate I found in the ruined city.

913
01:27:03,932 --> 01:27:08,561
I found out it contains the lyrics to that melody.

914
01:27:10,188 --> 01:27:11,147
That song?

915
01:27:13,274 --> 01:27:16,569
I wanted you to confirm it first, but...

916
01:27:21,574 --> 01:27:22,742
Wait a minute.

917
01:27:22,742 --> 01:27:25,078
It's not what you think. You've misunderstood.

918
01:27:25,078 --> 01:27:26,621
"It's not what you think?"

919
01:27:30,041 --> 01:27:31,292
A misunderstanding?

920
01:27:34,879 --> 01:27:35,755
I can't stand it.

921
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:38,258
I can't stand it!

922
01:27:40,385 --> 01:27:41,261
Minmay!

923
01:27:45,223 --> 01:27:47,017
Hurry and go after her.

924
01:27:49,185 --> 01:27:52,814
You two were just reunited. Don't hesitate because of me.

925
01:27:55,483 --> 01:27:59,070
It's more miserable to be receiving sympathy from you.

926
01:27:59,070 --> 01:27:59,988
Things are not like that!

927
01:28:01,698 --> 01:28:02,991
That's not what I was thinking!

928
01:28:08,788 --> 01:28:11,374
When the two of us wandered on the uninhabited Earth...

929
01:28:14,002 --> 01:28:16,129
...and barely made it back on Macross...

930
01:28:19,174 --> 01:28:21,843
...and heard Minmay's song in town...

931
01:28:23,428 --> 01:28:25,430
...and saw her on the screen.

932
01:28:28,224 --> 01:28:29,309
That's when I knew.

933
01:28:36,149 --> 01:28:38,943
The one who I want by my side forever...

934
01:28:43,114 --> 01:28:44,282
...is you.

935
01:28:47,035 --> 01:28:48,495
I still feel the same way.

936
01:28:54,334 --> 01:28:55,251
Honestly?

937
01:28:57,754 --> 01:28:59,881
There's no telling when I might get killed.

938
01:29:02,842 --> 01:29:04,886
But if you don't mind someone like me...

939
01:29:20,568 --> 01:29:21,820
What's wrong with me?

940
01:29:22,737 --> 01:29:25,073
Isn't it strange, Hikaru?

941
01:29:32,372 --> 01:29:34,332
Tears won't stop flowing from my eyes.

942
01:29:37,752 --> 01:29:38,503
Misa.

943
01:29:43,008 --> 01:29:43,675
Hikaru!

944
01:29:57,063 --> 01:29:58,898
It's a Red Alert, priority one!

945
01:30:30,764 --> 01:30:32,599
Take these lyrics to Minmay.

946
01:30:48,573 --> 01:30:51,201
What! The "Lyric" is not ready yet?

947
01:30:51,618 --> 01:30:55,288
Also, Lynn Minmay is missing.

948
01:30:56,247 --> 01:30:57,791
Unbelievable!

949
01:30:59,125 --> 01:31:00,794
The Meltran are de-folding.

950
01:31:32,909 --> 01:31:37,330
You have to get Minmay to sing this song now.

951
01:31:38,665 --> 01:31:41,251
Lapramiz's fleet has now de-folded.

952
01:31:42,252 --> 01:31:46,006
If the song is incomplete, we cannot make Meltran surrender.

953
01:31:46,006 --> 01:31:48,508
Therefore, we must annihilate them.

954
01:31:49,175 --> 01:31:52,178
Targets: across and Lapramiz's fleet.

955
01:31:53,179 --> 01:31:55,056
All Zentran ships prepare for battle.

956
01:31:59,686 --> 01:32:03,982
It was only a short peace, after all.

957
01:32:04,983 --> 01:32:08,528
Lift off immediately! Let's get out of here!

958
01:32:48,526 --> 01:32:49,402
It started.

959
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:59,079
Fools, Bodolza!

960
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:28,168
Hikaru...

961
01:34:33,423 --> 01:34:34,174
Minmay...

962
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:43,224
You came...

963
01:34:44,017 --> 01:34:46,102
You came for me, right?

964
01:34:49,481 --> 01:34:52,484
I want you to sing this song.

965
01:34:53,526 --> 01:34:54,861
What's that?

966
01:34:54,861 --> 01:34:57,655
Why must I sing the song that that woman found?

967
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:08,208
Due to the damage in the stabilization circuit...

968
01:35:08,208 --> 01:35:09,751
...we can only fire once.

969
01:35:10,502 --> 01:35:13,672
Understood. Prepare to fire immediately.

970
01:35:14,297 --> 01:35:18,843
But there are tens of thousands of our own ships in the path of our gun.

971
01:35:19,302 --> 01:35:21,096
No need to worry about that! FIRE!

972
01:35:25,934 --> 01:35:26,810
WHAT!?

973
01:35:44,869 --> 01:35:47,288
Unbelievable!

974
01:35:49,207 --> 01:35:51,001
Even if I sing that song...

975
01:35:51,001 --> 01:35:54,754
...there's no possible way we could win with such a thing!

976
01:36:01,803 --> 01:36:08,309
If we're going to die anyway, just stay here with me.

977
01:36:09,811 --> 01:36:11,479
It's not just our problem.

978
01:36:11,896 --> 01:36:14,274
It's for everyone on board Macross.

979
01:36:14,649 --> 01:36:16,568
That has nothing to do with us at all.

980
01:36:16,568 --> 01:36:20,447
Why can't we be the only two people in the world?

981
01:36:22,866 --> 01:36:24,242
Except for you and me...

982
01:36:25,702 --> 01:36:27,620
I don't care if everyone else dies.

983
01:36:48,058 --> 01:36:49,059
Senior died.

984
01:36:49,434 --> 01:36:50,143
Kakizaki died.

985
01:36:51,353 --> 01:36:52,520
They all died.

986
01:36:53,813 --> 01:36:56,024
They had left many dreams that they wanted to be completed.

987
01:37:13,458 --> 01:37:15,335
You can still sing, can't you?

988
01:37:54,708 --> 01:37:56,376
I'm sorry, Hikaru.

989
01:37:59,629 --> 01:38:01,131
I don't know what got into me.

990
01:38:02,382 --> 01:38:05,218
I chose a singing career for myself.

991
01:38:09,305 --> 01:38:13,727
And if I don't sing, my mother and father won't be able to rest in peace.

992
01:38:15,895 --> 01:38:16,604
Minmay!

993
01:38:19,524 --> 01:38:22,819
I'll sing with all my heart!

994
01:38:50,263 --> 01:38:57,604
I hear your voice now, saying "come here".

995
01:38:57,604 --> 01:39:04,444
When sadness is about to overcome me.

996
01:39:08,114 --> 01:39:15,622
Now I see your figure, walking toward me.

997
01:39:15,622 --> 01:39:17,374
As I wait with my eyes closed.

998
01:39:17,374 --> 01:39:18,750
As I wait with my eyes closed. [What's that...?]

999
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:22,671
As I wait with my eyes closed. [Minmay's song!]

1000
01:39:25,674 --> 01:39:29,844
Until yesterday became now. [Strange... This song...]

1001
01:39:29,844 --> 01:39:33,390
My heart that was clouded with tears. [I feel as if I heard it a long time ago.]

1002
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:34,015
My heart that was clouded with tears. [Why?]

1003
01:39:34,015 --> 01:39:43,149
My heart that was clouded with tears.

1004
01:39:43,149 --> 01:39:47,070
Do you remember that moment...

1005
01:39:47,070 --> 01:39:49,364
...when our eyes first met?

1006
01:39:49,364 --> 01:39:51,199
...when our eyes first met? [I understand.]

1007
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:57,372
Do you remember that moment... [The culture in our genes is being awakened.]

1008
01:39:57,372 --> 01:39:58,707
...when our hands first touched? [What?]

1009
01:39:58,707 --> 01:40:03,336
...when our hands first touched? [After an Interval of 500,000 cycles.]

1010
01:40:03,336 --> 01:40:08,508
It was the first glow of love between us. [Can Culture be brought back to us?]

1011
01:40:08,508 --> 01:40:14,389
I love you so.

1012
01:40:34,868 --> 01:40:38,288
Britai 7018 to the commander of Macross:

1013
01:40:38,288 --> 01:40:41,082
We will protect you from now on.

1014
01:40:41,082 --> 01:40:41,958
Protect us?

1015
01:40:44,044 --> 01:40:47,881
We cannot allow the Culture of Protoculture to be lost.

1016
01:40:52,969 --> 01:40:56,598
To all listening to Lynn Minmay's song:

1017
01:40:56,598 --> 01:40:59,309
We have only one enemy.

1018
01:40:59,309 --> 01:41:01,561
Defeat Gorg Bodolza!

1019
01:41:03,021 --> 01:41:07,317
Bring Culture back to us!

1020
01:41:15,158 --> 01:41:21,748
Now I can see your eyes...

1021
01:41:22,582 --> 01:41:25,043
...even if we're apart...

1022
01:41:25,043 --> 01:41:28,254
Making my body warm up. [So, this is Lynn Minmay's song?]

1023
01:41:32,759 --> 01:41:40,183
Now I believe in your love.

1024
01:41:40,684 --> 01:41:47,440
Although you are far away, please protect me.

1025
01:41:50,777 --> 01:41:53,530
Until yesterday...

1026
01:41:54,114 --> 01:42:07,961
...my world was clouded with tears.

1027
01:42:07,961 --> 01:42:11,965
Do you remember that moment...

1028
01:42:11,965 --> 01:42:16,636
...when our eyes first met?

1029
01:42:16,636 --> 01:42:21,016
Do you remember that moment...

1030
01:42:21,016 --> 01:42:24,978
...when our hands first touched?

1031
01:42:25,645 --> 01:42:34,154
That was the first glow of love between us.

1032
01:42:34,154 --> 01:42:39,325
I love you so.

1033
01:42:39,325 --> 01:42:47,292
I'm not alone anymore.

1034
01:42:47,876 --> 01:42:55,216
Because you are here.

1035
01:42:56,968 --> 01:43:00,722
Do you remember that moment...

1036
01:43:00,722 --> 01:43:05,185
...when our eyes first met?

1037
01:43:05,769 --> 01:43:09,689
Do you remember that moment...

1038
01:43:09,689 --> 01:43:14,652
...when our hands first touched?

1039
01:43:14,652 --> 01:43:23,203
That was the first glow of love between us.

1040
01:43:23,203 --> 01:43:28,708
I love you so.

1041
01:43:34,923 --> 01:43:43,890
I'm not alone anymore.

1042
01:43:44,015 --> 01:43:47,560
Because you are here. [Main target is at A-133 Z-165.]

1043
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:52,399
Because you are here.

1044
01:43:52,691 --> 01:44:01,783
I'm not alone anymore.

1045
01:44:01,783 --> 01:44:08,623
Because you are here.

1046
01:44:08,623 --> 01:44:10,667
Because you are here. [PROTOCULTURE...!!!]

1047
01:44:10,667 --> 01:44:19,426
I'm not alone anymore.

1048
01:44:19,426 --> 01:44:28,018
Because you are here.

1049
01:46:01,403 --> 01:46:03,321
Skull-1 to Delta-1:

1050
01:46:06,282 --> 01:46:07,367
Mission accomplished.

1051
01:46:08,034 --> 01:46:09,369
I'm heading home.

1052
01:46:13,164 --> 01:46:15,250
This is Delta-1: Roger.

1053
01:47:49,678 --> 01:47:51,763
Now the real hardship starts.

1054
01:47:52,931 --> 01:47:58,061
In this galaxy alone, there are supposed to be over a thousand fleets...

1055
01:47:58,061 --> 01:48:01,189
...led by mobile fortresses of Bodolza and the Lapramiz-class.

1056
01:48:01,606 --> 01:48:02,607
Probably.

1057
01:48:03,983 --> 01:48:07,362
But a single song could bring all this change.

1058
01:48:09,114 --> 01:48:11,991
We can only believe in the power of Culture.

1059
01:49:45,543 --> 01:49:48,922
What was that song?

1060
01:49:52,092 --> 01:49:53,593
Just a popular song.

1061
01:49:53,593 --> 01:49:55,095
A popular song?

1062
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:01,685
Just an ordinary song that was popular...

1063
01:50:01,685 --> 01:50:03,937
...in an alien city tens of thousands of years ago.

1064
01:50:06,981 --> 01:50:11,486
Of course it was... a love song.
