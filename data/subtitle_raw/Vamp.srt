1
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:41,194
Welcome to
your worst nightmare.

2
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:45,016
You are about to make
the ultimate sacrifice;

3
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:49,021
The supreme test
of immortality;

4
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:53,660
A rope--

5
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:58,166
Now--
Now !

6
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:00,168
Look out !  Look out !

7
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:02,171
Uh-Oh.

8
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:09,179
Uh, the supreme sacrifice...

9
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,683
Cut !
Will take place--

10
00:03:12,183 --> 00:03:14,053
Stop.  Time out.

11
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:17,056
I'd rather hang than listen
to this again, you know ? Come on.

12
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,564
I mean, this isn't a frat house.
It's a halfway house for morons.

13
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:25,566
The spooky costumes
and the phony hangings--

14
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:29,204
- Guys, gimme a break.
- Silence, pledge.

15
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:31,207
The emma dipsa phi
initiation has just begun.

16
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,210
Oh, i get it.You're trying to
bore us to dea--

17
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:37,715
- They're trying to bore usto death.
It's working. - Oh, yeah.

18
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:42,220
I asked you guys to be careful with my
clothes. Now, who wrinkled my shirt ?

19
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,092
-It wasn't me !

20
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:50,598
We've misjudged you two.You're obviously
not dipsa phi material.

21
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,102
No.  You know, i think it's keith
and i who seem to be mistaken here.

22
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:56,342
Am i right ?Oh, yeah.
Fooled completely.

23
00:03:56,605 --> 00:04:00,110
We were under the impression
that this wasthehouse on campus !

24
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,393
But if you're the kind
of organization...

25
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:06,117
That'll take any dickhead who will jump
off a stool with a noose around his neck--

26
00:04:06,118 --> 00:04:10,622
Guys !  Obviously,you don't see the
advantages of your position.

27
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:13,126
What advantages ?

28
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,629
You have something we want.

29
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,632
Plus, your accommodations, cable
television, accommodations.Cable !

30
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,635
Continental cuisine--
Food.

31
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:23,083
Instead of making us go through
these stupid, immature-

32
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:24,640
- What's the word i'm looking for ?

33
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:28,645
Asinine. Asinine tests-- Which
we find incredibly boring--

34
00:04:28,646 --> 00:04:31,149
Wouldn't it be much more
to your advantage...

35
00:04:31,282 --> 00:04:33,284
To take this situation...

36
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:35,287
And get something
for yourselves ?

37
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:38,907
Y-Yes !  You got a big party
tonight, right ?

38
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:41,411
And for this party,you're definitely
gonna need party--

39
00:04:41,412 --> 00:04:45,916
Stuff.Booze.Tunes. Stuff.You're gonna
need booze, tunes, entertainment.

40
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:47,919
Booze is easy.
We provide it.

41
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,422
Anything at all. Anything you need,
and we're in.

42
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:55,929
- Anything ?
- Excuse us. One second. Come here.

43
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,934
Listen, a.J. I'm really excited about the
way this is going.

44
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:02,065
I'm a little concerned
with this "anything" part.

45
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:05,441
Couldn't you have said,
"a thing," or "something" ?

46
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:08,445
Keith, keith, keith !

47
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:11,448
Relax, will ya ? These guys are operating
on empty.

48
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:14,952
I'll take care of this.
Trust me.

49
00:05:16,955 --> 00:05:18,957
A stripper.
And by tonight.

50
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:21,655
This is great. I can't wait to see you get
us out of this one.

51
00:05:23,463 --> 00:05:26,467
After all these years,
you don't trust me ?

52
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:28,470
The truth ?
No, lie to me.

53
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:30,472
Yeah. I trust ya.

54
00:05:30,722 --> 00:05:33,226
Yeah.  Yeah,
just one number.

55
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:36,730
That's it. I know you're a dancer,
professionally-Trained,

56
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:39,233
And i wa--
I was just thinking...

57
00:05:39,234 --> 00:05:41,800
How interesting it would be
to do it with your clothes off.

58
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,242
You're doing well,
you know that ?

59
00:05:46,243 --> 00:05:49,746
- Bear with me here.
-

60
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:57,756
Hey, sandy.
How are ya doin' ?

61
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,260
Yeah, this is a.J.

62
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:02,145
Oh, so you heard ?

63
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:05,015
It'll only take
five minutes.

64
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:08,018
Come on.
I'd do it for you.

65
00:06:10,155 --> 00:06:12,658
Field trip.

66
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:15,912
- We'll hire ourselves a pro. - Great !
Call me when you get back.

67
00:06:15,913 --> 00:06:19,416
How much money have you got ? A.J., they're
not worth it.

68
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:22,387
They ? I could care less about those wimps.

69
00:06:22,388 --> 00:06:25,374
It's their frat house. What a place to
operate from !

70
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,158
Aw, come on. You're givin' me a headache.

71
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:29,379
We're 200 miles from civilization. We got
no money...

72
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,384
And no way to get there-- Tell me the dipsa
phi house is worth this aggravation.

73
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,392
I got 82 bucks.
Right.

74
00:06:40,393 --> 00:06:42,896
Together, we total 168.
That and a little charm...

75
00:06:42,897 --> 00:06:45,900
Should get us a stripper
and one deadly number.

76
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:48,402
Now all we need
are some wheels.

77
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:50,405
Duncan.

78
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:58,248
Duncan spriggs unleashes a monstrous drive,
right down the center of the fairway.

79
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:01,753
It's a beauty.  Once again,
an amazing performance...

80
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,891
-By-- - Hi there. You have a car, right ?

81
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,893
Uh, i have-- Listen, i'll pay for the
damages.

82
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,398
I shouldn't have parked there
anyway, i know that.

83
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:15,403
What car was it anyway ? No, no, you see ?
Weneed a car.

84
00:07:15,404 --> 00:07:17,906
Yeah, we're taking a little trip, and we'd
like to work out a deal...

85
00:07:17,907 --> 00:07:19,908
For some transportation.
Oh !

86
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:25,783
Hey, guys !  Guys, hey,

87
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:28,285

Anytime you want to catch a movie, you just

91
00:07:37,798 --> 00:07:40,300
Just give me a buzz !
Buzz this, huh ?

92
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:46,191
It'll be a pleasure
helping you guys out.

93
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:49,194
Can i call you "guys" ?
Great.

94
00:07:49,195 --> 00:07:53,199
Aw, come on. Sit down.  Relax. Kick back,
dudes.

95
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,206
You know, i mostly get your basic dorks
hanging around here.

96
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:02,712
They seem to gravitate towards me. I don't
know why !

97
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:04,714
Yeah.  Yeah.

98
00:08:05,214 --> 00:08:07,718
I'm surprised. I haven't seen you two up
here...

99
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:09,720
At dunc's place before.

100
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:12,223
This place is
usually swinging.

101
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:14,226
You ought to
pop up sometime.

102
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:18,231
Come on, fellas.  Eat.
Mangia', mangia'. Eat.

103
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,738
So.
Takin' a trip, huh ?

104
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:26,742
Need a rod, huh ?

105
00:08:27,242 --> 00:08:29,745
You're in luck.

106
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:33,116
One left.

107
00:08:33,117 --> 00:08:37,121
Now, normally i charge the average shmo--
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

108
00:08:37,122 --> 00:08:40,125
Charge ? Yeah, we were thinking something
more along the lines...

109
00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:42,629
Of a favor,
to be returned.

110
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,632
Of course.
That's new.

111
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:48,636
I like that !

112
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:52,140
One hand washes the other, right ? Right !
Yeah !

113
00:08:52,641 --> 00:08:55,859
Now, if there's anything-- If there
wassomething that we could do for you.

114
00:08:56,646 --> 00:08:59,149
I already know.
Be my friends.

115
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,151
Take me with you.

116
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:03,154
Oh--

117
00:09:03,155 --> 00:09:06,659
All right.  For a week. Take me with you

118
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,661

119
00:09:08,662 --> 00:09:11,665
Take me with you and just pretend to be my
friends for a week.

120
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:22,177
This is fantastic ! Hey, guys, i'm psyched.
Let's party.

121
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:24,636
Hey, where are we going ?
Ah, doesn't matter.

122
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:26,683
What counts is that
you're my buddies.

123
00:09:27,685 --> 00:09:30,187
For a week.

124
00:09:35,945 --> 00:09:41,451
????

125
00:09:41,452 --> 00:09:44,338
?? You think i'm cute ??

126
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,340
?? A little bit shy ??

127
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:50,345
Uh-- ?? Doctor, doctor give me the news ??

128
00:09:50,346 --> 00:09:54,350

of lovin' you ??

00:09:54,351 --> 00:09:57,354
?? No pills ??
?? Shake my fills ??

130
00:09:57,355 --> 00:10:02,360
?? "Tallywhackers."  "G-Spot." Hey, guys !
"Boob-O-Rama !"

131
00:10:02,361 --> 00:10:04,058
Hey, "strip search."
?? I got it bad ??

132
00:10:04,363 --> 00:10:07,366
"Meat rack."  "Lido lounge !"

133
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:10,370
Let me have this.

134
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:16,378
Hey ! This is the one, right here. I can
feel it.

135
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:19,131
"The after dark club.
Hottest acts anywhere."

136
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:23,136
Guys, it sounds classy. Think we should
have called for reservations ?

137
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:25,139
I'm ready.

138
00:10:25,506 --> 00:10:28,010
Weareready.

139
00:10:54,793 --> 00:10:58,798
Twelve for a dollar-Fifty. Socks, six for a
dollar. Twelve for a dollar-Fifty.

140
00:10:58,931 --> 00:11:00,684
Socks !

141
00:11:05,556 --> 00:11:07,692
A.J.  Watch--
Whoa !

142
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:18,956
Guys !

143
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:32,724
Uh, you get the feeling
we're not in kansas anymore ?

144
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,254
Well, the guy says
it's just down the street.

145
00:11:57,255 --> 00:12:00,758
But the ad says that the club won't open
until after dark.

146
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:04,763
Don't know what the hell
that means.

147
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:13,274
Well, it's dark. Yeah, but is it "after
dark" ?

148
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,384
No, but i definitely
think it's dark.

149
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,300
But it might have
just turned dark.

150
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:19,782
How are you supposed to know the exact
moment it's dark ? If we knew that,

151
00:12:19,783 --> 00:12:22,534
We'd wait a few seconds, and it would be
"after dark," right ? So when's that ?

152
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:24,537
I don't know. But you know what i'm saying.

153
00:12:24,538 --> 00:12:27,041
"After dark"
could mean morning.

154
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:29,043
Am i making sense ?
No.

155
00:12:29,044 --> 00:12:31,413
Um, hurry it up.
It's closing time.

156
00:12:32,414 --> 00:12:34,417
Okay.  Yo, dunc !
Hey, let's go !

157
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:36,552
I'm going
as fast as i can.

158
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:41,058
I just closed.

159
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:44,062
You just opened.
Again.

160
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:04,087
Coffees.
Six cups.

161
00:13:04,088 --> 00:13:06,590
To go.

162
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,980
- Don't do that.
- Shh.

163
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:30,487
I'm not kidding.

164
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,003
Branch.  Snow !

165
00:13:47,508 --> 00:13:50,512
A.J., help me.

166
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:55,518
Nope.

167
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:02,527
You see something funny ?

168
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:05,530
I think
this is serious.

169
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:08,534
A.J., i live,
you die.

170
00:14:08,535 --> 00:14:14,541
I think i'm gonna let maven there cut one
of your balls off.

171
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:23,019
Uh, whoo-Ee.
Looks like it'll be...

172
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,021
Another hour or so
on these toilets.

173
00:14:25,022 --> 00:14:29,527
These pipes are tough. So, if you 'scuse
me, i'll get back to work.

174
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:48,300
Yeah, i definitely think
it's after dark now.

175
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:51,304
Snow.

176
00:14:51,305 --> 00:14:53,306
I'm a.J.

177
00:14:53,307 --> 00:14:55,810
Come on.  All this over
three lousy teeth ?

178
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,312
Who spoke to you ?

179
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,818
Uh-Oh.

180
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:19,840
No-O !

181
00:15:19,841 --> 00:15:22,342
-
-  Stop !

182
00:15:22,343 --> 00:15:27,348
Drop the knife, snowflake, or you'll be
picking these up off the floor.

183
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:33,106
?? Volare ??

184
00:15:33,607 --> 00:15:35,610
?? Oh-Oh, oh-Oh ??
Hey, duncan.

185
00:15:35,611 --> 00:15:40,616
If you've finished with those toilet
seats-- ?? Cantare ??

186
00:15:40,617 --> 00:15:45,622
?? Whoa-Ho, ho-Ho ??
?? Oh-Oh, oh-Oh, oh-Oh ??

187
00:15:45,623 --> 00:15:48,626
Lucky they didn't try
the bathrooms.

188
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:51,629
I was ready. What i would have done to
them--

189
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,382
-
-

190
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:56,848
?? We can sing in the glow
of a star that i know of ??

191
00:15:57,003 --> 00:16:00,007
?? Where lovers enjoy
peace of mind ??

192
00:16:00,008 --> 00:16:04,512
?? Let us leave the confusion
and all disillusion behind ??

193
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:07,015
?? Yeah, yeah, yeah

194
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:12,522
Hey, messin' with my buddies, huh ?  Wham.
Right in thetzhatzhkehs.

195
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:16,026
Hey, one guy takes on
the three of us.

196
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:20,031
Hey !  Maybe we ought to wait and see if
you want to go another round !

197
00:16:20,032 --> 00:16:22,534
How about that, bernie,
huh ?  What's--

198
00:16:24,537 --> 00:16:28,526
Dunc, they ordered
six coffees.

199
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:38,471
Okay, so it's not
caesar's palace.

200
00:16:42,976 --> 00:16:44,979
Let's get this
over with quick.

201
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,482
?? I'm in the mood
for love ??

202
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:50,986
?? Simply because
they're naked ??

203
00:16:50,987 --> 00:16:54,491
Guys, i'm on a roll tonight.
And when that happens,

204
00:16:54,492 --> 00:16:57,495
I attract women
like flies.

205
00:16:57,496 --> 00:16:59,997
Even.
Shit.

206
00:16:59,998 --> 00:17:03,001
?? Only because they're naked ?? I'll see
you in a few.

207
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:07,006
Uh-Huh. ?? I'm in the mood for love ??

208
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:09,009
Hey--  Wait a minute.
Wait a-- Wh-- Where--

209
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,011
I thought-- We gotta be gettin' back soon.

210
00:17:11,012 --> 00:17:14,015
A.J.'S gonna take care
of everything, okay ?

211
00:17:14,016 --> 00:17:16,518
Wait a minute.
This isn't fair !

212
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:20,022
We come out here, and i don't even get a
chance to watch ?

213
00:17:20,023 --> 00:17:22,025
I should have a say
in the selection.

214
00:17:22,026 --> 00:17:24,528
You can interview her
in the car.

215
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:28,032
Uh-Uh.  No way. One for all, and all
inside, i say.

216
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:31,036
Ta-Ta !
Duncan, don't do that.

217
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:35,542
Six coffees.

218
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:40,548
?? I'm in the mood
for love ??

219
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:44,052
?? Simply because they're naked ???? ????

220
00:17:44,553 --> 00:17:48,558

221
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:54,065
How are ya doin',

222
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:55,567
Could i see

Good.
Good enough !

224
00:18:06,581 --> 00:18:09,083
Perfect.

225
00:18:09,084 --> 00:18:11,086
Go ahead.

226
00:18:15,342 --> 00:18:18,846
?? See him talkin' to a lady ??

227
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,850
Bar or table ?

228
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,852
Ringside.

229
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:28,358
????
Thank you. Sir.

230
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:34,783
?? You remember when he said ??

231
00:18:35,283 --> 00:18:39,038
?? You're the only girl
i need ??

232
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:44,294
?? And now the words they sting
and the harm they bring ??

233
00:18:44,544 --> 00:18:46,547
????

234
00:18:46,548 --> 00:18:49,801
?? This just is like a knife
right in the back ??

235
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:52,805
Oi, vai.
?? Now that you were caught ??

236
00:18:52,806 --> 00:18:54,808
?? In a jealous trap ??

237
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:58,446
?? These words are ringin'
right through the dark ??

238
00:18:58,447 --> 00:19:01,949
?? Of your suspicious mind
and jealous heart ??

239
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:05,954
?? Lipstick on his collar ??

240
00:19:05,955 --> 00:19:09,459
-?? Perfume in his hand ??
-   Hey, blondie.

241
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,464
?? And when he came home
last night ??

242
00:19:13,465 --> 00:19:16,468
?? He was sneakin'
up the stairs ??

243
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,474
?? 'Cause he's the only boy ??

244
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:25,979
?? Your body wants to know ??
Hit 'em.

245
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,485
?? And is it worth the pain
to hide the shame ??

246
00:19:30,486 --> 00:19:33,489
?? Or better to let her go ??

247
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,493
?? This just is like
a knife right in the back ??

248
00:19:36,993 --> 00:19:40,998
?? Now that you are caught
in a jealous trap ??

249
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:45,003
Over here. ?? These words are ringin' right
through the dark ??

250
00:19:45,004 --> 00:19:48,508
?? Of your suspicious mind
and jealous heart ??

251
00:19:49,008 --> 00:19:53,013
?? These words are ringin'
right through the dark ??

252
00:19:53,014 --> 00:19:56,518
?? Of your suspicious mind
and jealous heart ??

253
00:19:57,018 --> 00:19:59,021
?? Whoa ??

254
00:19:59,022 --> 00:20:03,143

Hey, it's show time.

That's it.
We're out of here.

333
00:35:33,601 --> 00:35:36,105
Oh, excuse me.
Could you go backstage...

334
00:35:36,605 --> 00:35:39,108
And tell my friend that
his buddy is waiting ?

335
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:42,612
It's time to go now.
I see no friends.

336
00:35:42,613 --> 00:35:45,116
Uh, yeah, yeah.
You took him backstage.

337
00:35:45,117 --> 00:35:48,620
Uh, he's tall, dark-Haired. Gray jacket on.

342
00:36:07,393 --> 00:36:10,897
There's a problem.
He was not alone.

343
00:36:10,898 --> 00:36:14,402
He has a friend. He's downstairs talking
with the new girl.

344
00:36:15,904 --> 00:36:18,907
I think there's
another one of them.

345
00:36:18,908 --> 00:36:21,411
That's it.  One number
to get into a frat.

346
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:24,915
Except now i don't care. All i wanna do is
find a.J. And get back--

347
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:28,920
A.J. ?  Not mr. Dynamite !
You guys still hangin' out ?

348
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:32,425
I knew it, yep. Come on.  I'll bet you
he'll remember me.

349
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,432
Hey, you see a guy
come back here ?

350
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:40,435
Welcome to bow-Wow city.

351
00:36:40,436 --> 00:36:43,438
Hey, you guys see a guy come back here ?
Tall, good-Looking--

352
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:45,441
You see a guy come back here ?
No guy came back here.

353
00:36:45,442 --> 00:36:48,445
No guy came back ? No, he came back.  One
of the girls brought him.

354
00:36:48,446 --> 00:36:51,948
Her. You !  I remember now. So sorry.

355
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:56,455
Your friend wanted to see katrina.  I tell
him no one see katrina.

356
00:36:56,456 --> 00:36:59,958
He didn't have much of a chance with her.
Katrina owns this dive, sweetheart.

357
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:02,962
After that-- Are you saying that you didn't
see what happened ?

358
00:37:02,963 --> 00:37:04,965
Wait !

359
00:37:06,967 --> 00:37:09,471
Where's candi ?
She's half-Shift tonight.

360
00:37:09,971 --> 00:37:12,975
Mm-Hmm. I'm afraid a.J. Has decided to hold
auditions.

361
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:14,977
No, he wouldn't
just leave.

362
00:37:14,978 --> 00:37:18,482
Not even with a girl who will melt in your
mouth and in your hands ?

363
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:21,486
Yeah, he'd leave. I'm gonna kick his-- But
wait !

364
00:37:21,487 --> 00:37:23,488
W-What a coincidence.
It's time for my break,

365
00:37:23,489 --> 00:37:26,492
And i have to go over by the hotel and pick
up a change of tops.

366
00:37:26,493 --> 00:37:28,995
Some of the girls stay there. I bet if we
hurry, we can catch a.J.

367
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:31,498
I'll meet you at the side entrance in two
minutes, okay ?

368
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,502
Excuse you !

369
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:37,506
You wanna find a.J., right ? Right.

370
00:37:37,507 --> 00:37:39,508
Well, then go !

371
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:48,018
She'll use you,
she'll abuse you.

372
00:37:48,019 --> 00:37:51,523
She'll whip you guys
into shape.

373
00:37:51,524 --> 00:37:54,026
Cimmarron !

374
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,653
?? And the meaning of love ??

375
00:38:02,153 --> 00:38:04,656
?? And the meaning of love ??

376
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,665
?? And the meaning of love
and the meaning of love ??

377
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:19,174

379
00:39:16,913 --> 00:39:19,917
Don't !
Aren't we jumpy tonight ?

380
00:39:29,178 --> 00:39:31,681
This is really weird. It's like a reunion
or something.

381
00:39:31,682 --> 00:39:34,185
Yeah, i wish
i knew with who.

382
00:39:34,186 --> 00:39:37,188
When the time is right,
i promise i'll tell you.

383
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,943
He's on his way.
Don't screw up.

384
00:39:40,944 --> 00:39:43,830
You got it ?
All right.

385
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:47,334
Okay, you're dying
to ask me.

386
00:39:47,335 --> 00:39:49,336
What ?
Why i strip.

387
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:51,840
No, i wasn't. I wasn't going to ask you.
Yes, you are.

388
00:39:51,841 --> 00:39:53,842
Why not ? It's none of my business.

389
00:39:53,843 --> 00:39:57,346
It's nothing to be ashamed of, really. It's
natural curiosity.

390
00:39:57,347 --> 00:39:59,850
The club's not a permanent stop, if that's
what you think.

391
00:39:59,851 --> 00:40:03,354
I mean, it's easy to get, it's loose, i can
express myself--

392
00:40:03,355 --> 00:40:07,359
And that is really important, because i'm
still trying to find my purpose in life.

393
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,361
Know what i mean ?
God knows i've looked.

394
00:40:09,362 --> 00:40:11,364
Tried the acting thing for a while-- What a
trip.

395
00:40:11,365 --> 00:40:13,366
I was onthe love connection.
I got picked !

396
00:40:18,622 --> 00:40:20,625
Oh, god.
That's so sad.

397
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,627
Little girl,
where's your mommy ?

398
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:31,139
Parents like that
should be shot.

399
00:40:43,654 --> 00:40:47,159
You screwed up.
You're sushi, baby.

400
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,662
He was so beautiful.
I was sure you would like him.

401
00:40:50,663 --> 00:40:52,665
You knew the rules.
She knows the rules !

402
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:56,170
Only the transients,
the loners, the strays.

403
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:58,172
The ones that
can't be traced !

404
00:40:58,173 --> 00:41:01,676
He said he was alone, that he was just
passing through.

405
00:41:01,677 --> 00:41:04,180
He fit the profile.
Ha !

406
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:07,684
He was a gift.
Nice gift.

407
00:41:08,185 --> 00:41:12,190
I'm gonna have to kill 'em both.  Don't
worry. I'll take care of it.

408
00:41:13,691 --> 00:41:15,694
You're not gonna
punish her ?

409
00:41:15,695 --> 00:41:18,197
If it were me--

410
00:41:18,198 --> 00:41:21,201
Look, if i had some power--
All right !

411
00:41:22,702 --> 00:41:24,705
All right.

412
00:41:24,706 --> 00:41:28,210
If we had just moved the whole operation to
vegas, like i suggested--

413
00:41:29,211 --> 00:41:32,715
Thank you. I am loyal to you forever.

414
00:41:32,832 --> 00:41:35,836
- I will be more care--

415
00:41:48,602 --> 00:41:50,604
Well, i...

416
00:41:50,605 --> 00:41:53,108
Guess vegas is out.

417
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,458
Ex-Cuse me.

418
00:42:09,461 --> 00:42:11,964
Twenty dollars
a half hour.

419
00:42:12,465 --> 00:42:16,470
I'm from the club, remember ?
I checked in this afternoon ?

420
00:42:16,471 --> 00:42:19,974
I'd like the key
to 1311, please.

421
00:42:22,477 --> 00:42:24,480
Thank you !

422
00:42:24,481 --> 00:42:27,984
Oh, could you please ring candi ?  You
know, the redhead ?

423
00:42:34,993 --> 00:42:37,997
Ah.
It's busy.

424
00:42:37,998 --> 00:42:39,999
But you can go up
if you like.

425
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,918
Room 1309.

You're not the same woman.  You're sleepin'
all day, you're up all night.

00:43:52,806 --> 00:43:54,809

Ah.  Fuck.  Jeez.

We should heard
something by now.

437

I don't like it.

If something goes wrong, that queen bitch
is gonna chewmyass out.

439
00:45:39,523 --> 00:45:43,027
Vlad, give it up.

440
00:45:43,028 --> 00:45:46,030
There's nothin' goin' on
between you and her anymore.

441
00:45:46,031 --> 00:45:48,534
All you are to her
is a quick fix.

442
00:45:48,535 --> 00:45:52,155
Hey, but
what do i know ?

443
00:45:57,745 --> 00:46:00,749
-Hey ! - There you are. What happened ?

444
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,253
They told me you left. A.J. Did you find
him ?

445
00:46:03,254 --> 00:46:05,341
No.  God, you look awful.
What happened to you ?

446
00:46:05,755 --> 00:46:07,258
The girl.
What did she say ?

447
00:46:07,259 --> 00:46:10,260
Well, it's weird. I went to her apartment.
It was like no one lived there.

448
00:46:10,261 --> 00:46:13,265
Empty. Just some garment bags. What are you
so testy about ?

449
00:46:13,266 --> 00:46:15,768
"Testy" ? You want to know why i'm testy ?

450
00:46:15,769 --> 00:46:19,272
I'll tell you why i'm testy.
Today, i was nearly hung.

451
00:46:19,273 --> 00:46:21,775
I got into a fight
with a psychotic albino.

452
00:46:21,776 --> 00:46:23,778
I met a human pincushion
in the bathroom.

453
00:46:23,779 --> 00:46:26,281
I ate a cockroach,
my best friend disappears,

454
00:46:26,664 --> 00:46:29,285
And then i'm nearly assassinated by a
runaway elevator.

455
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,287
I've had a bad day.

456
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,790
All i want to do is find a.J. And get back
to school.

457
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:37,795
- Is that too much to ask ? - Well, no.
But i don't see what the big hurry is.

458
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:41,683
- He'll probably show up. - Listen.  Where
else would a girl like...

459
00:46:41,684 --> 00:46:44,687
Candi take a.J. ?

460
00:46:44,688 --> 00:46:46,689
Uh-Huh.  You mean a girl like me, don't you
?

461
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:49,693
Just go ahead and say it. I was only trying
to be helpful.

462
00:46:49,694 --> 00:46:52,697
I thought it would be kind of nice if you
and me spent some time--

463
00:46:52,698 --> 00:46:54,699
Oh, screw it.

464
00:46:56,202 --> 00:46:58,204
If you knew me
a little better--

465
00:46:58,205 --> 00:47:02,209
I don't know you at all ! And that's
another thing. How comeiremember you...

466
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:04,712
So well, and you--

467
00:47:04,713 --> 00:47:07,832
Obviously our moment together wasn't as
important to you as it was to me.

468
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:10,336
What moment ?
Look--

469
00:47:10,337 --> 00:47:12,339
Oh, look yourself !

No, i loveyou !

Say, babe, what time

All right ! Anybody want to claim this lush

Going once.
Going twice.

-Hey, what's that ?
- Nothing.

Come on ! You better get used to it,
scumbag.

488
00:50:21,374 --> 00:50:24,277
All this for
a fucking fraternity.

489
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,030
Psst !  Psst !

490
00:50:40,031 --> 00:50:42,266
Psst.  Psst.

Jeez.

00:51:31,411 --> 00:51:34,414
Uh, hey !
I found my friend.

495
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,551
Snow !
There he is !

496
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:19,053
Shit !

497
00:52:46,304 --> 00:52:49,308
Hey !  Over here !

Hey !  Stop !
Help !

Stop !

502
00:53:32,362 --> 00:53:34,865
Wait a minute !

503

Come on. Emergency operator. May i help you
?

504
00:54:09,525 --> 00:54:11,527
I'll take care of the cops.

505

I-I'll tell 'em a story,
like i always do.

506
00:54:15,165 --> 00:54:19,170
They won't follow up.
They don't care...

507
00:54:19,171 --> 00:54:21,172
What happens down here.

508
00:54:23,675 --> 00:54:27,180
Have you given any more thought to my idea ?

509
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,632
A club.

510
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:33,637
In vegas.
New blood ?

511
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:36,141
"New blood" ?

512
00:54:37,642 --> 00:54:41,647
See, they're all...
tourists.

513
00:54:44,651 --> 00:54:49,157
I-I hear that clubs are very hot right now
in vegas.

514
00:54:49,158 --> 00:54:51,660
We'll do very nicely.

515
00:54:55,165 --> 00:54:58,669
All right, all right. I'll do something.
Vlad !

516
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,672
Bring the trash
back in here.

517
00:55:14,188 --> 00:55:17,692
This is
a nasty habit.

518
00:55:19,695 --> 00:55:21,697
Nasty.

519
00:55:32,711 --> 00:55:35,465
???? Hey, bud. Where ya been ?

520
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:37,968
I've been making some progress. The police.

521
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:40,471
Did they get here yet ?

522
00:55:40,472 --> 00:55:43,976
Jesus christ.
A.J.'S dead.

523
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,482
Stay here.

524
00:55:49,483 --> 00:55:53,487
?? Baby, now, roll on
past my window ??

525
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:50,058
-
- It's occupied.

526
00:56:52,194 --> 00:56:54,697
There's somebody in--

527
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:00,321
Wh-Wha--

528
00:57:00,705 --> 00:57:02,707
Relax, will you ?
It was just a joke.

529
00:57:02,823 --> 00:57:05,460
I thought you--

530
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:15,472
You asshole !

531
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:18,476
You scared the shit out of me, you know
that, huh ?

532
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,479
Relax, will you ?
Relax ?

533
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,984
You were dead.
You were in a dumpster.

534
00:57:23,985 --> 00:57:26,486
I thought that snowflake
had killed you.

535
00:57:26,487 --> 00:57:28,489
Hey, i was rolled.

536
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:30,491
Anyone could have
an off night.

537
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:32,494
Off night ?

538
00:57:32,495 --> 00:57:35,497
We're out of here.
You.

539
00:57:35,498 --> 00:57:40,003
There's some... uniformed gentlemen in the
back to see you.

540
00:57:40,004 --> 00:57:43,457
Look, i-I found
my friend.

541
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:45,961
Yeah ?

542
00:57:49,015 --> 00:57:51,017
But he--

543
00:57:51,018 --> 00:57:53,520
Well, helookeddead
anyway.

544
00:57:53,521 --> 00:57:57,025
He looks real dead to me. It was in the
garbage--

545
00:57:57,525 --> 00:58:00,134
Your friend here apparently likes to flash
his money around.

546
00:58:00,313 --> 00:58:02,531
In this neighborhood,
that makes him a meal ticket.

547
00:58:02,532 --> 00:58:07,537
Hey, tell me about it. Iama meal ticket. I
should know.

548
00:58:07,538 --> 00:58:10,041
Look, i just--
No, you look.

549
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:14,546
Now my stomach's all upset, thanks to you
and your dead friend here.

550
00:58:14,547 --> 00:58:17,550
This is not a nice area, and i don't like
coming to it,

551
00:58:18,051 --> 00:58:20,704
So before i lock you up, i want all three
of you out of here.

552
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:23,056
Go home. I've been trying to do that for
the past--

553
00:58:23,057 --> 00:58:25,060
Now.

554
00:58:25,061 --> 00:58:28,563
Officer, why don't i escort you out
personally ?

555
00:58:28,564 --> 00:58:32,068
I know you like to catch
the last act, am i right ?

556
00:58:32,069 --> 00:58:37,075
Hey, guys, if you don't mind,
i'm going to catch the last act.

557
00:58:37,076 --> 00:58:39,694
Okay.  We'll see you out there in a few
minutes, buddy.

558
00:58:40,078 --> 00:58:43,582
And i promise you'll never see us in this
neighborhood again, officer.

559
00:59:06,945 --> 00:59:09,449
I'm pissed at you.

560
00:59:09,949 --> 00:59:13,454
Mmm.  They treat you
real good here.

561
00:59:13,455 --> 00:59:15,572
Looks like we can
forget about the fraternity.

562
00:59:15,573 --> 00:59:18,076
Why don't we just
go back home, okay ?

563
00:59:18,077 --> 00:59:23,082
What's the rush ? A.J., gimme a break, will
ya ?

564
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:26,586
Would you calm my friend down here, please ?

565
00:59:26,587 --> 00:59:29,089
I've been telling him
for years to relax.

566
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:33,594
I'm fine, i'm fine. Let's just get out of
here. Please.

567
00:59:38,101 --> 00:59:40,103
That's not fair.

568
00:59:41,989 --> 00:59:44,492
Come on.

569
00:59:56,006 --> 00:59:58,760
- Wait !
-

570
01:00:32,552 --> 01:00:34,555
I didn't think
you had it in you.

571
01:00:35,055 --> 01:00:38,560
Yeah.  Looks like you discovered the only
way out of here, pal.

572
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:41,312
What the hell you
talkin' about ?

573
01:00:41,563 --> 01:00:45,067
The club, everyone here, man, they're
vampires.

574
01:00:49,072 --> 01:00:51,576
Can't let you leave.

575
01:00:53,077 --> 01:00:55,581
We got a problem here.

576
01:00:56,081 --> 01:00:58,083
Yeah ?
Why don't we go home ?

577
01:00:58,084 --> 01:01:00,086
We'll call a doctor
or something.

578
01:01:00,087 --> 01:01:03,591
You don't get it, do you ?

579
01:01:04,091 --> 01:01:07,095
Home is a million miles
away from me now.

580
01:01:07,596 --> 01:01:10,599
Home's another planet.

581
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,603
I'm a fuckin' zombie now !

582
01:01:13,604 --> 01:01:15,606
I mean, look at me.

583
01:01:17,608 --> 01:01:20,111
Watch out, man !

584
01:01:23,115 --> 01:01:25,117
You wanna know
how bad things are ?

585
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:29,623
I love you, keith,

586
01:01:29,624 --> 01:01:33,628
But all i can see
right now is food,

587
01:01:33,629 --> 01:01:35,631
And i'm starving.

588
01:01:39,134 --> 01:01:43,139
You're carrying my next meal around with
you in your veins.

589
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:46,644
They got me.
They got me real good.

590
01:01:46,645 --> 01:01:50,148
Okay, why don't you take
what you need for now ?

591
01:01:50,149 --> 01:01:52,151
You know, to get you through.

592
01:01:52,401 --> 01:01:56,406
That's too much.
And you're so nice.

593
01:01:56,407 --> 01:01:58,408
Do i look like
a mosquito ?  No.

594
01:01:58,909 --> 01:02:01,913
I can't be trusted,
buddy.

595
01:02:01,914 --> 01:02:06,285
Will you look at my clothes ? They're
ruined.

596
01:02:07,787 --> 01:02:11,792
Do i look real bad ? You know, it's just
like the movies.

597
01:02:11,793 --> 01:02:14,295
You can't see yourself.

598
01:02:14,296 --> 01:02:18,300
There's no reflection.

599
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:20,803
It's weird.

600
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:26,560
?? No pill's gonna
cure my ills ????

601
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:37,574
Jesus.  You're really
gonna do it, aren't you ?

602
01:02:37,575 --> 01:02:39,576
You're gonna kill me.

603
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:45,084
A.J., do me a favor, huh ?

604
01:02:45,584 --> 01:02:49,589
For old time's sake ?
Sure, buddy.  Anything.

605
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:52,593
Anything at all.

606
01:02:52,594 --> 01:02:56,598
No.  Not anything.
Just one thing.

607
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:01,104
Make sure i don't
come back like you, okay ?

608
01:03:01,105 --> 01:03:04,107
Hey, you think i like this ?

609
01:03:04,108 --> 01:03:06,610
Or them ?
They're boring creeps.

610
01:03:06,611 --> 01:03:09,114
They don't call 'em "walking dead" for
nothing !

611
01:03:09,115 --> 01:03:11,116
Try talking to one of them
sometime.

612
01:03:11,117 --> 01:03:13,119
I am.

613
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:32,192
Come on, man.

614
01:03:32,692 --> 01:03:34,695
Just take me out.

615
01:03:36,197 --> 01:03:38,200
Just kill me.
I can't go on like this.

616
01:03:40,702 --> 01:03:43,206
A.J., i--
Come on !

617
01:03:49,214 --> 01:03:51,216
Shit !

618
01:03:51,217 --> 01:03:54,220
You can't, can you ?

619
01:03:54,221 --> 01:03:57,724
Even though you know
it works, you can't !

620
01:03:57,725 --> 01:04:02,230
It does work, you know. The fire, the
wooden stakes, the sunlight.

621
01:04:02,231 --> 01:04:04,232
Got a list right here
somewhere.

622
01:04:08,353 --> 01:04:10,356
You're ready to die
for me, aren't you ?

623
01:04:10,857 --> 01:04:14,862
You would 'cause you can't believe that i'm
not me anymore,

624
01:04:14,863 --> 01:04:17,365
That maybe there's
something left, huh ?

625
01:04:21,169 --> 01:04:23,673
Jesus christ.
Maybe there is.

626
01:04:25,174 --> 01:04:29,179
Nah.

627
01:04:30,682 --> 01:04:33,051
Sorry, pal.

628
01:04:47,069 --> 01:04:49,071
Now get lost fast.

629
01:04:49,321 --> 01:04:50,824
Go on !

630
01:04:51,324 --> 01:04:56,831
And remember, you can burn 'em or keep 'em
from their coffins past sunrise.

631
01:04:56,832 --> 01:04:59,334
I think you know the other one.

632
01:05:15,271 --> 01:05:18,275
???? Last call, gentlemen. Last call.

633
01:05:18,775 --> 01:05:20,277
Hope you enjoyed
the show.

634
01:05:20,777 --> 01:05:24,282
Don't forget our
single man's special:

635
01:05:24,283 --> 01:05:26,785
All you can drink
for a dollar.

636
01:05:26,786 --> 01:05:31,291
Come alone, you drink yourselves into
another world.

637
01:05:34,795 --> 01:05:41,303
?? I know a lot about
the world outside ??

638
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:46,309
?? It's not too safe
so i usually hide ??

639
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:48,312
Hey !
We're leaving.

640
01:05:48,313 --> 01:05:50,815
That's not fair. I only had to promise her
$50.

641
01:05:50,816 --> 01:05:53,818
Now.  I'll explain later.

642
01:05:56,322 --> 01:05:59,326
Guys !

643
01:05:59,327 --> 01:06:02,329
Excuse me, there seems to be a little
problem with your bill.

644
01:06:15,523 --> 01:06:18,349
When the place clears out, why don't you
and me go in the back...

645
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:20,852
And handle it personally ?

646
01:06:20,853 --> 01:06:25,358
Hey, call the police ! These people,
they're all vampires !

647
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:27,361
Eat shit and bark at the moon. That doesn't
make 'em bad people.

648
01:06:27,362 --> 01:06:29,863
Listen, a.J.'S dead. Again ?

649
01:06:29,864 --> 01:06:33,868
Vampires !  Vampires.

650
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:36,372
You don't think you're gonna get away with
this, do you ?

651
01:06:36,373 --> 01:06:38,266
Of course.  You know how many people

652
01:06:38,267 --> 01:06:40,844
Disappear off the face of
the earth every year ?

653
01:06:40,845 --> 01:06:44,348
Not thousands. Tens of thousands. You're a
statistic, kid.

654
01:06:44,349 --> 01:06:48,854
Why us ? Why'd you pick on us ? It was a
mistake.

655
01:06:48,855 --> 01:06:50,856
Okay ?  There was
a little error there.

656
01:06:50,857 --> 01:06:52,859
A little communication
error.  I'm sorry.

657
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:57,364
We'll be missed. They're gonna come looking
for us. Who ?

658
01:06:57,365 --> 01:06:59,868
Who'd you tell that
you were comin' here ?

659
01:06:59,869 --> 01:07:04,373
Nobody tells anybody when they come to a
joint like this.

660
01:07:04,874 --> 01:07:06,876
Quite a racket, huh ?

661
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:13,384
You see, i'm runnin'
a central service here.

662
01:07:16,889 --> 01:07:19,391
Waste disposal.
Oh, yeah.

663
01:07:19,893 --> 01:07:21,845
Look around.
Look who comes here:

664
01:07:21,846 --> 01:07:26,350
The sickies, the degenerates, the forlorn,
the lost,

665
01:07:26,351 --> 01:07:29,855
The lowlifes, the fuckin' dregs of humanity
wind up here,

666
01:07:29,856 --> 01:07:31,858
And we take care of 'em.

667
01:07:31,859 --> 01:07:34,861
It costs you nothing.

668
01:07:34,862 --> 01:07:37,848
Yeah, just my best friend.

669
01:07:37,849 --> 01:07:40,835
Hey, nobody's perfect,
okay ?

670
01:07:41,336 --> 01:07:44,590
I do the best i can
with what i got.

671
01:07:48,595 --> 01:07:52,100
Your self-Pity
makes me sick.

672
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,602
You know that ?

673
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:59,108
Listen, kid,
i used to own this club.

674
01:07:59,109 --> 01:08:03,613
You know who worked here ?
Louis prima.  Buddy greco.

675
01:08:03,614 --> 01:08:06,617
Phil harris.  Class.

676
01:08:06,618 --> 01:08:09,621
Wait a second.
Where are you going ?

677
01:08:09,622 --> 01:08:12,124
What are you trying to do,
get outta here ?

678
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:16,129
Why ?  There's
more of us out there.

679
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:20,134
Oh, yeah.
So where you goin' ?

680
01:08:20,135 --> 01:08:24,757
Here, there.

681
01:08:25,257 --> 01:08:27,243
We're everywhere.

682
01:08:30,297 --> 01:08:33,818
Can i ask you somethin' ?
You ever been to vegas ?

683
01:08:36,270 --> 01:08:40,777
Hey, how about you buying me and my friends
a last round ?

684
01:08:40,778 --> 01:08:44,247
Kind of a last request,
like they do in vegas.

685
01:08:44,248 --> 01:08:46,750
They do that in vegas ?

686
01:08:46,751 --> 01:08:50,255
Whoa.  That's classy.
Now, that's classy.

687
01:08:50,256 --> 01:08:52,257
Sure.
Uh, excuse me.

688
01:08:52,258 --> 01:08:54,260
Would you give this gentleman whatever he
wants ?

689
01:08:54,261 --> 01:08:57,764
Give me a brandy.
Make it three.

690
01:08:57,765 --> 01:08:59,766
Make 'em doubles.

691
01:08:59,767 --> 01:09:01,769
Triples.

692
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,272
Hell, leave the whole bottle
when you're done.

693
01:09:04,772 --> 01:09:06,775
I'm not drivin' anywhere.

694
01:09:20,409 --> 01:09:23,413
Spill these
all over the place.

695
01:09:28,419 --> 01:09:30,422
Oops !  Oh, i'm sorry.
Excuse me.

696
01:09:30,423 --> 01:09:32,424
Duncan, have a drink.

697
01:09:36,562 --> 01:09:39,066
To vegas.  Oh !

698
01:09:57,706 --> 01:10:01,593
-

699
01:10:02,595 --> 01:10:05,098
Whoa !
Let me out of here !

700
01:10:11,356 --> 01:10:13,976
Come on !
The trap door.

701
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:18,115
Okay, you win.
I'm gone.

702
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:22,620
What the hell
you doin' ?

703
01:10:22,621 --> 01:10:25,873
The bitch owed me money.

704
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:35,753
This way.

705
01:11:01,668 --> 01:11:04,672
?? Old black magic
has me in its spell ??

706
01:11:04,673 --> 01:11:07,176
I would loved
to have seen vegas.

707
01:11:09,428 --> 01:11:11,431
Once.

708
01:11:12,932 --> 01:11:15,436
Just once.

709
01:11:17,438 --> 01:11:21,943
????

710
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:24,947
Ah...

711
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:29,953
My first drink...
in 75 years.

712
01:11:33,458 --> 01:11:35,961
Vlad,

713
01:11:35,962 --> 01:11:38,464
To the good ol' days.

714
01:11:40,967 --> 01:11:44,722
?? Aflame burnin' desire ?? ?? That only
your kiss ??

715
01:11:44,723 --> 01:11:46,724
?? Put out the fire ????

716
01:12:14,342 --> 01:12:17,847
-
- Shit.

717
01:12:58,013 --> 01:13:00,015
Guys ?

718
01:13:23,545 --> 01:13:27,850
How you doin'
back there, dunc ?

719
01:13:27,851 --> 01:13:29,853
I'm hungry.

720
01:13:30,354 --> 01:13:32,857
He's okay.

721
01:13:33,308 --> 01:13:35,310
No.  I mean i'm starvin'.

722
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:38,814
Yeah, well, we'll order some pizza when we
get back to school,

723
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,817
If that's okay with y--

724
01:14:14,108 --> 01:14:16,578
Guys !

725
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:28,593
Guys !

726
01:14:41,476 --> 01:14:43,478
W-W-Wait, wait.

727
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,984
Move.

728
01:14:54,993 --> 01:14:57,630
Looks like we're not the first ones to be
midnight shopping.

729
01:14:58,130 --> 01:15:00,633
It was already bent.

730
01:15:14,651 --> 01:15:17,153
Find some bullets.

731
01:15:42,552 --> 01:15:44,554
Will this help ?

732
01:15:44,555 --> 01:15:48,059
You got ammo with that ? You mean bullets ?
No.

733
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:50,562
Hey, where'd you get that ?
Get back.

734
01:15:50,563 --> 01:15:54,199
I'm good with this,
believe me.

735
01:15:56,569 --> 01:15:58,572
Look.  No fangs.
Come on.

736
01:15:58,956 --> 01:16:01,458
- Who are you ?
- I-I-I, um--

737
01:16:01,459 --> 01:16:03,828
Your name.
Tell me your real name.

738
01:16:04,329 --> 01:16:08,084
Um, i, uh-- This isn't exactly the time i
had in mind.

739
01:16:08,584 --> 01:16:11,221
I thought maybe--

740
01:16:27,942 --> 01:16:30,946
Did you actually think i could've been one
of those ? I-- I--

741
01:16:31,446 --> 01:16:33,448
No.

742
01:16:39,957 --> 01:16:41,959
This way.

743
01:16:46,881 --> 01:16:51,021
Yeah !  We're saved ! Thank god for mass
transit. Come on.

744
01:16:54,524 --> 01:16:58,029
Last stop.
I don't believe this shit !

745
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:27,817
Talk about timing.
Come on !

746
01:17:47,457 --> 01:17:50,344
What gang is this ?

747
01:17:53,849 --> 01:17:55,852
Wait.

748
01:18:00,107 --> 01:18:02,109
Come on.  Help me.

749
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:06,614
Keith ?  It's time.

750
01:18:08,117 --> 01:18:09,618
What ?
My name.

751
01:18:10,069 --> 01:18:12,572
I'm allison. I'm allison hicks. Remember ?

752
01:18:12,573 --> 01:18:15,075
Seaside heights, summer vacation, fifth
grade.

753
01:18:15,076 --> 01:18:17,078
We were in
sue leonard's basement.

754
01:18:17,079 --> 01:18:20,081
We were playing spin the bottle, and i spun
and it landed on moose,

755
01:18:20,082 --> 01:18:22,584
And you kinda pushed the bottle and i
didn't have to kiss him.

756
01:18:22,585 --> 01:18:25,588
I ended up kissing you.
Remember now ?

757
01:18:25,589 --> 01:18:28,091
Yeah.  You have incredible timing. Thanks.

758
01:18:30,394 --> 01:18:32,514
You sure it's safe
down here ?

759
01:18:33,014 --> 01:18:35,016
Trust me.
This is an abandoned system.

760
01:18:35,017 --> 01:18:37,019
Been here before.

761
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:44,913
What was that ?

762
01:18:44,914 --> 01:18:46,915
Probably just a wino
or something.

763
01:18:47,415 --> 01:18:49,919
In high heels ?

764
01:18:51,921 --> 01:18:53,924
Come on.

765
01:19:00,431 --> 01:19:02,434
Here.

766
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:11,862
Come on.

767
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,402
I have matches here somewhere. Don't.

768
01:19:43,902 --> 01:19:46,406
I smell something.

769
01:20:01,925 --> 01:20:05,429
I think we should leave. This is not a very
good idea.

770
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:30,151
Allison, the matches.

771
01:21:30,152 --> 01:21:33,155
You called me allison !
The matches !

772
01:22:07,365 --> 01:22:09,367
Allison !

773
01:22:17,877 --> 01:22:20,881
Keith !

774
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:22,374
Go !  Shoot her !

775
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:24,878
Shoot her, please.

776
01:23:24,879 --> 01:23:27,380
Now.

777
01:23:38,945 --> 01:23:41,448
Keith.

778
01:24:26,621 --> 01:24:29,125
Let's go.

779
01:24:40,772 --> 01:24:43,275
- Come on ! - There's something i gotta do
first.

780
01:27:28,097 --> 01:27:30,600
Oh !  You're bleeding !
Oh, it's nothing.

781
01:27:32,102 --> 01:27:34,605
Mmm.  Mm-Mm.

782
01:27:35,105 --> 01:27:37,758
This could get infected. We'll have to have
this checked out.

783
01:27:41,113 --> 01:27:43,617
Thanks.

784
01:27:59,135 --> 01:28:03,140
Uh, hon ? Come up here a second. I wanna
show you something.

785
01:28:05,644 --> 01:28:08,147
What ?

786
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:13,654
God !  That supposed
to be funny ?

787
01:28:13,655 --> 01:28:15,656
No.

788
01:28:29,674 --> 01:28:31,676
You kill my katrina.

789
01:28:31,677 --> 01:28:33,679
You both must die !

790
01:28:34,179 --> 01:28:36,182
Ugh !

791
01:28:47,079 --> 01:28:49,582
Well, don't everybody
thank me all at once.

792
01:28:49,583 --> 01:28:52,085
Wai-- Y-You--

793
01:28:55,089 --> 01:28:57,842
Formica.
Go figure.

794
01:28:58,843 --> 01:29:01,347
Hi, allison.

795
01:29:03,849 --> 01:29:07,854
Relax.  I'll take care
of this somehow.

796
01:29:12,861 --> 01:29:16,365
This... has been
one wacky night.

797
01:29:16,615 --> 01:29:18,618
You're tellin' me ?

798
01:29:18,619 --> 01:29:20,620
I'm gonna need
some new clothes here.

799
01:29:22,623 --> 01:29:24,625
Wait.  Where you goin' ?

800
01:29:27,629 --> 01:29:29,632
After all these years,
you don't trust me ?

801
01:29:30,133 --> 01:29:32,635
I can handle this,
you know.

802
01:29:35,639 --> 01:29:38,643
Look, there's always
night school.

803
01:29:38,644 --> 01:29:41,147
Hi there.
Hi.

804
01:29:41,148 --> 01:29:44,650
And jobs ?  I'll--
I'll take a graveyard shift.

805
01:29:45,152 --> 01:29:47,154
Yeah.  That's what i'll do.

806
01:29:47,155 --> 01:29:51,659
Keith ? Relax.  I'll take care of
everything.

807
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:54,163
Follow us.

808
01:29:54,164 --> 01:29:57,167
I'm right below you, pal.

809
01:29:57,667 --> 01:30:00,220
Hey, you guys
live in a barn or what ?
