1
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:21,083
What's the story here?

2
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:23,999
Car trouble, huh?
Yeah.

3
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:28,209
Well, what's a pretty girl like you
doing out on a road like this at night?

4
00:00:28,209 --> 00:00:30,999
Freezing.

5
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:41,542
Sara Jackson, investigative reporter.

6
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,709
You got a busted water hose
here, Lady.

7
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:45,459
Oh.
Is that expensive?

8
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:47,292
Well, you know what?
I'll tell you what.

9
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:51,042
You know, I think we can make some
kind of arrangement or something.

10
00:00:51,042 --> 00:00:52,751
This doesn't sound ethical.

11
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:55,751
That's a $10 word. I was
thinking more like a barter.

12
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:58,501
Oh. Like, uh, goods for services?

13
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:02,083
Yeah.
What'd you have in mind?

14
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:09,083
Chase, I can't believe
you sent me to work...

15
00:01:09,083 --> 00:01:14,667
with a busted water hose,
thank you very much.

16
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:19,334
Okay.
Who's watching Raquel?

17
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:21,334
You know something?
When I was 15 years old,

18
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:24,709
I could pull an engine out and
put it back in in the same day.

19
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,999
Raquel can take care of herself.
You know what?

20
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:29,501
What?

21
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:31,999
When I was 15 years old,

22
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:35,375
I fell in love with a grease monkey,

23
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,209
and I married him.

24
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:41,709
You... are... a grumpy..

25
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:44,334
Having fun?

26
00:01:44,334 --> 00:01:48,292
grumpy, stubborn guy...

27
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:53,709
who doesn't wanna face up to the
person he really is, which is..

28
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:55,834
Keep going.
someone..

29
00:01:55,834 --> 00:02:00,042
someone who cares about life
more than anyone I've ever met..

30
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:01,999
Keep it up.
I'm liking it.

31
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:06,876
and who watches his family
every minute,

32
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,999
works his fingers to the bone.

33
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:11,709
He always comes shining through.

34
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:13,918
It's true!
Ladies and Gentlemen..

35
00:02:13,918 --> 00:02:15,999
I'm grumpy, I'm grouchy.
I'm all those things,

36
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:18,999
but, Your Honor, I gotta admit,
I love my wife.

37
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:22,167
Oh. Good answer. You wanna
ride in the cab with me?

38
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:25,626
Is somebody out there Mm-hmm.
Let's go.

39
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:26,709
Somebody's on the radio.

40
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:30,876
Holy mother, that thing is huge.
Flew like the wind too.

41
00:02:30,876 --> 00:02:32,250
Yeah? This is Chase Jackson.
Go ahead.

42
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,417
Did you see it, Baby? It's huge! It's
comin' your way. What's coming my way?

43
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:39,083
Have you seen it? I don't
know what that thing was!

44
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:42,292
What's comin' my way?
Get out of the road, Honey.

45
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:47,125
What's comin' my way?
My God, that thing was huge!

46
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:52,999
Come back.  Oh, my dog..
my dog ran after it.

47
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:13,125
Stop, you son of a bitch!
Stop!

48
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,542
Oh, my God.
Baby, don't move.

49
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:21,999
I'm gonna get some help.
No! Chase, don't go.

50
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:24,542
Oh, Sweetheart.
Oh, God.

51
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:27,167
What?
Oh, no. Raquel..

52
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:33,167
Raquel..
Did you see it?

53
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:36,125
Did you see it?

54
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,667
What, Baby?
It was wonderful.

55
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:41,083
Did you see it?

56
00:03:42,626 --> 00:03:45,334
Come back.

57
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:47,250
What?

58
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,209
Come on, Baby.
Don't go.

59
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:53,083
Somebody come back.

60
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:56,292
Oh, no.

61
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:58,876
I've seen..

62
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:02,125
Come on back now.

63
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,999
Anybody there?

64
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:09,834
Anybody?

65
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:21,918
Sheriff!
You closin' up for the day?

66
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,042
I got a call from Mrs. Star.

67
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:27,042
Says some kids broke into her yard
and dyed her prize chicken blue.

68
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:29,626
We'll try to figure out if
it's the Picket Boys or not.

69
00:04:29,626 --> 00:04:32,417
Sir, I'd be more than happy
to take care of that for you.

70
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:33,999
Besides, you've already done
your four hours of duty.

71
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:38,999
I know those insurance companies don't want me
loggin' more than a couple hours under my badge,

72
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:40,959
but I'm still the sheriff, Ken,

73
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,125
and turnin' 70 ain't a death warrant.

74
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,501
Sir, I didn't mean anything
by that.

75
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:47,834
I-I know that you can do it.

76
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,834
I just..
I just wanna help.

77
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:53,334
Ken, your motives have only
been good.

78
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,375
You can give me a hand
by backing me up.

79
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,999
Mrs. Star can get pretty ornery
with that cane sometimes.

80
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,292
That she could.

81
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:16,999
I must be losing my mind. You gotta
blend in with the culture, Wade.

82
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,375
Whose culture's that, exactly?

83
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:23,626
I'll tell you what. If this place
is an example of American tradition,

84
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:25,999
it blows my mind how you lot
took it from us.

85
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:29,083
What are you talking about?
America was never England.

86
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:33,083
I hate to disappoint you, Mate.
You mean we used to talk like you?

87
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,250
No. We used to talk like you
until we sorted our heads out.

88
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,999
Please tell me you're not behind on
your meds. I am, as a matter of fact.

89
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:44,083
You'd think I could at least fill
my prescription in this town.

90
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,918
I mean, who's heard of a pharmacy
that doesn't have Prozac...

91
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:49,834
but serves bubble gum ice cream
on tap, for God's sake?

92
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:51,375
Maybe people here don't get depressed.

93
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,751
Are you kidding? Have you
taken a look at this town?

94
00:05:53,751 --> 00:05:58,000
I wish you guys were half as combat-ready
as you're not ready for prime time.

95
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,999
I gotta take this.

96
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:04,626
Hey, Tim. Yeah.

97
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:07,959
Okay. Uh, buy a thousand
shares at 750.

98
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,209
No, I don't care what the P.E.
is. Just buy it.

99
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:12,167
Hey, man,I'm kind of in a rush.
I gotta go.

100
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:17,459
But will you call me back before
the bell? Okay. See you, Buddy.

101
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:20,626
Alice in bloody Wonderland.

102
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:33,125
Sorry to keep you waitin', Sirom.
Here's your coffee.

103
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,999
Is there anything else I can
do for ya? Nah.

104
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:38,999
This oughta do me just fine.

105
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,083
Priscilla, you got any more
of them muffins?

106
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,501
Yeah, we got more of those muffins.

107
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:47,542
But you keep eatin' 'em, then your
wife's gonna feed you to the wolves.

108
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:52,250
Say hi to Krista for me.
♪ Well, I'm fallin' drunk again ♪

109
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,876
♪ I guess she must have got to me ♪♪

110
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:04,125
Shh.

111
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,250
Unbutton that.

112
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:14,250
S..

113
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,626
Apron.

114
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:29,250
Oh, my God.

115
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:34,667
I've got customers out there.

116
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,999
They can wait a second.
A second?

117
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:41,751
I guess you really don't wait
for tomorrow, do you? Mm-mmm.

118
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:44,999
Mmm. Hey, Vin, do you remember
that conversation...

119
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:48,709
I was havin' with you
yesterday about marriage,

120
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,292
when you said you would marry
a girl just like me?

121
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:53,501
Did you mean it?
I've never lied to you.

122
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:58,999
I guess not in the whole
four days I've known you.

123
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,209
He wants to build a big white house...

124
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:17,083
and one of those extra large
above-ground swimming pools.

125
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:21,459
One of those blue things?
No. The pink sparkly kind.

126
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,999
Got fishes on it?
Uh-huh.

127
00:08:23,999 --> 00:08:29,792
Well, you stick with me, I'll get
you two pools and two pools to match.

128
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:33,959
Whoo-hoo! It's 1:00.
I got my lunch rush.

129
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:36,999
What.. Shit!

130
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:39,999
Baby, I gotta go.

131
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,250
When are you comin' back?

132
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,292
In time enough to make my
princess a queen.

133
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:49,876
Hey, here's my number.

134
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:50,959
Don't worry if my mama answers.

135
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,459
Just tell her you're one of the recruiters
from one of those big city beauty schools.

136
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:00,125
She still thinks I have
a future in front of me.

137
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,834
Beautiful girl like you...

138
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,584
deserves a beautiful future.

139
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:13,417
I'll see you, Baby.

140
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:26,959
Ooh-whee!

141
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:59,334
Get down!

142
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,626
Hey, Baby, how you doin'?
What's up?

143
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:21,125
The only cop in this whole town,
and here he is.

144
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,250
Where's that Sasquatch festival thingy
I've been hearin' so much about?

145
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,834
You're on the wrong side of town.

146
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:36,334
Great, great. Thanks, Bro. Son, I think
you dropped this back at the diner.

147
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:39,000
Ah! Yes, I did.
Thank you. Not so fast.

148
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,042
In this town, that just earned
you a ticket for littering.

149
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,292
Well, uh,
how.. how about just a warning?

150
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:49,375
Not today. Sorry.

151
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,250
Go, go, go, go, go!
So am I.

152
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:03,834
Get in the car, now!

153
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:08,999
Wade, what are you doin'? I'm the
driver, Man. Get out. I'm the driver!

154
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:12,209
Go!
Let's go!

155
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:14,959
Freeze!

156
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:24,083
Ooh-whee!

157
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:33,459
We're closin' early today.
I'll give you a really good deal.

158
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:38,959
You found the special tape.
I'm Raquel.

159
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,999
Hi. Erin.
Hi.

160
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:43,792
Um.. So, uh, what's so special
about this?

161
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,501
They call it the Jackson Footage.

162
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:48,999
For better or for worse, it kind
of put this little town on the map.

163
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:53,042
You might have even seen a piece of
it on TV on one of those sci-fi shows.

164
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:56,834
It was the last thing my mother
ever saw before she was killed.

165
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:59,292
Oh, God, I..
It's okay.

166
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,876
It only lasts a couple of seconds,
and it's kind of hard to see.

167
00:13:02,876 --> 00:13:05,959
But there's something.
What

168
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:09,334
A bear, someone in a suit..
Who knows?

169
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,042
You want me to fill 'er up?

170
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,167
Um, yeah.
Yeah, please.

171
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,459
Where are you runnin' to?

172
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:35,542
Uh, running to?

173
00:13:35,542 --> 00:13:37,459
Not that I'm being nosy.

174
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:40,209
Maybe a little bit. I watch a
lot of detective shows.

175
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:44,000
But I saw those boxes taped up
like you were in a rush,

176
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,999
and the rest of your car's so neat.

177
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:49,501
It made me think you must've
been in a real hurry.

178
00:13:49,501 --> 00:13:52,417
That's, um..
That's pretty good.

179
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:53,999
Yeah, yeah,
I suppose I-I am in a hurry.

180
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:59,584
I'm just sort of, um.. I don't know..
trying to start a new life, I guess.

181
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:01,999
I'm just a little anxious.

182
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:04,584
It's 40.
Oh. Yeah.

183
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:09,083
Thank you.
I want you to take this.

184
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,167
Oh, no, no, no. I don't think
I'm the right person for that.

185
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,501
I don't know what I could've
sold it for,

186
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:18,292
and it would have either
been too much or not enough.

187
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:22,167
I just decided the best person to have
it is the one with the clean slate.

188
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:25,125
So whatever you do with it
is the right thing.

189
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,999
Okay.
Well, thank you.

190
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:30,459
Believe me, it's my pleasure.

191
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:36,292
Oh, um, do you know of, like,
a scenic route that's heading east?

192
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,999
Yeah, just take State Road 29.

193
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:41,292
It starts off as a dirt road,
but it gets really pretty.

194
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:42,999
Okay. Bye.

195
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:45,999
Bye.
Bye.

196
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:41,250
No. Oh, my God.

197
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,751
My God.

198
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:58,250
Whoo-hoo!

199
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,999
Thank God for the seat belt law.

200
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:06,999
Nice drivin', Wade.

201
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:10,999
Oh, Man.
Grab the money!

202
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:13,999
Oh, my God. No.

203
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:22,083
Wade!
Help me get this money here.

204
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:27,709
Grab the money, Wade!
All right. All right.

205
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:31,042
Hey.

206
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:34,000
You got insurance?

207
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,999
Yeah.

208
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:40,167
That's good, 'cause
we sure as hell don't.

209
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,834
Come on.

210
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:46,083
Wade!

211
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:49,334
I'm hurt, Man, bad!

212
00:16:49,334 --> 00:16:51,999
Wade, come on.
Help me.

213
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:54,459
Look at me.
You're all right. Come on.

214
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:59,125
I can't get up, Wade.
Help me.

215
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:01,667
Hang on.

216
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:07,584
Are you guys okay?

217
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:09,999
Yeah, we're just fine, thanks.

218
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:14,876
Take it easy, Kayla. She looks nice
enough. Didn't have to front-kick her.

219
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:18,999
It's cool. It's cool.
Kayla, she's coming with us.

220
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:23,709
Come on, Wade! Get the money, will ya,
before we lose half of it to the wind!

221
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,584
You're a cold bastard.
You know that? Come on!

222
00:17:26,584 --> 00:17:30,751
Get up.
Leave your shit.

223
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:32,667
Go over there.

224
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,999
Hey, uh, John Wayne's comin'.

225
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:41,209
Damn it! They're comin'.
Come on. Take cover.

226
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:45,999
Just your friendly
neighborhood bank robbers.

227
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:48,999
Let's go! Go!
Come on! Let's go!

228
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:58,542
Okay.

229
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,999
Hot damn! There they are!
Keep your head, Chris.

230
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:08,292
Those are the ones that shot Sirom!

231
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:11,918
Ken, did you see what I saw?

232
00:18:11,918 --> 00:18:14,083
Yeah.
It looked like more than four,

233
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,709
definitely armed,
and they might have a hostage.

234
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:23,999
This is Sheriff Harris Zeff! Throw out
your weapons and release the hostage!

235
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:25,999
Let's keep from sheddin'
any more blood!

236
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:27,999
I only saw three.
There's only three. Okay.

237
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:33,250
That's a sweet truck with an
eight-inch lift. Bad-ass!

238
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,918
What do we got?
What's the price now?

239
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:42,876
Buy 2,000 shares. Hey, I'm sorry,
Buddy. I gotta go. Bye-bye.

240
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:46,999
Okay, you guys, round out,
fire 'em up,

241
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:49,501
and let's try not to hit
anything but pork.

242
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:51,999
Okay, let's go!

243
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:10,542
Return fire. Go!

244
00:19:22,918 --> 00:19:25,834
I'm out!

245
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:33,042
We don't want any more
gettin' killed!

246
00:19:36,417 --> 00:19:40,667
What the hell are they waitin'
for? Should we keep shootin'?

247
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:44,042
Sheriff, I think we should
call for backup now.

248
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:46,918
Get the state police. They might
be heading toward the border.

249
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:51,667
Sheriff, we're talkin' about
some bank robbers here.

250
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:54,584
Sheriff, please..
Cover me.

251
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:57,042
Wait. Sheriff..
Wait!

252
00:19:58,334 --> 00:20:01,918
Chris, come on!
Cover!

253
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,667
They're in the timber!

254
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,501
Oh, wow.

255
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:38,501
We got us some real damn bad
guys here.

256
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:39,626
Let's get 'em!

257
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:45,292
Hold it, Chris. Radio Bernardo
and Britt to get into uniform.

258
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:46,959
Then call old Eli.

259
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:50,209
Have him bring his dogs
and hardware out here.

260
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:53,999
That's some bad country
they're in.

261
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:56,834
You're right about that.

262
00:20:57,918 --> 00:21:00,501
And we're goin' in it.

263
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:10,250
Put me down, Man.
Put me down.

264
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:15,667
Put me down! Come on! Put me down!
Put me down. All right. All right.

265
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:17,959
Come on.
Oh, Man!

266
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:21,000
Two more jobs and we're out for
good, remember? Man, it's cold.

267
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,709
We gotta leave him, Wade.
He's not gonna make it.

268
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:26,083
Shut up, Travis. He's still breathing.
Look it. He's finished.

269
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:30,667
We're not gonna be able to emerge from this
forest with stolen cash and a dead guy.

270
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,000
He dodges bullets for you,
and you just wanna leave him?

271
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,999
He didn't dodge bullets for me. He did it for
the same reason we all do it.. for the cash.

272
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:41,459
He walks into every dodgy job you toss
his way, always looking up to you,

273
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:42,999
and never questions a word
you said.

274
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:47,125
Look, he's not gonna question this
word either, okay? You need your pills.

275
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:51,959
You know that? Cut it out!
Come on!

276
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:57,042
Hey, law dog's got some company,
so we should get goin'.

277
00:21:57,042 --> 00:22:01,042
Ow! Man, he does not look good.

278
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:04,209
Our Father who art in heaven..

279
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,459
Aw, geez.
Amen.

280
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:14,375
Come on. We've gotta go!
Come on. Let's go.

281
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,250
Go. Go, Man.
Go.

282
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,042
I'm dead.
Listen, I'm dead.

283
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:22,918
I'm dead, Man.
Just go.

284
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,125
It's okay, Man.
Just go. I'm sorry.

285
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:27,417
Come on, Wade!

286
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:29,999
It's all right.

287
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:52,417
You got yourself here pretty quick.

288
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:53,125
You know how it is.

289
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:59,250
I was rigged out of the mud when
I got the call over the radio.

290
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:06,667
Next time you refer to me as a
prehistoric hemorrhoid over the radio,

291
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:09,167
I'm gonna shoot you in your foot.

292
00:23:09,167 --> 00:23:12,709
But that's your C.B. handle, Eli.
Don't you remember?

293
00:23:12,709 --> 00:23:14,459
When I'm on the job, it's Eli.

294
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:17,876
My old lady, she's got her
ears on all day every day.

295
00:23:17,876 --> 00:23:20,584
I don't need her on my case.

296
00:23:21,292 --> 00:23:24,042
Them the slicky boys that got Sirom?
Yeah.

297
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:28,209
Four men and a female hostage.
Where are the dogs?

298
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:31,000
Hell, I had to take 'em to the
vet to get their canines clean.

299
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,501
I'm sure they're flyin' high on some
kind of dog dope. But don't you worry.

300
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:40,501
Ain't nothin' they can't track
that I can't anymore. All right.

301
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:44,792
Well, these two blue legs
here'll be eatin' my dust.

302
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:47,999
I'll have 'em bagged and
tagged before chow.

303
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:37,751
We're in dark territory. Cell phones
and radios will last about a half a mile.

304
00:24:37,751 --> 00:24:40,876
Eli, you know this terrain.
Any trails?

305
00:24:40,876 --> 00:24:42,999
Hell, this is Mount Piez.
Bad country.

306
00:24:42,999 --> 00:24:48,501
Hell, even old monkey boy Chase Jackson
doesn't know that territory.

307
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:52,999
Eli, you know that old boy
watched our backs...

308
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:55,042
for two tours in country.

309
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:56,501
We owe each other for life.

310
00:24:56,501 --> 00:24:59,125
Yeah, but you know he's not the
same guy anymore, Sergeant.

311
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:03,125
When he came asking you for a
job, I know you noticed that.

312
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,292
Yeah, I sure wish we had him
with us now.

313
00:25:05,292 --> 00:25:09,042
Well, I'm the only point man
you'll need.

314
00:25:09,751 --> 00:25:12,999
Keep your powder dry, Mijo.

315
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:15,626
Keep my power drive?

316
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:20,999
Hey, who do you think you are,
old man?

317
00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:23,042
Bohica.
Bohica?

318
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:28,626
What does that mean?
"Bend over. Here it comes again."

319
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:19,042
Is that a real person?

320
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:21,751
Lay chilly, Boys.
He's dead.

321
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:24,542
Let's keep those guns half-cocked,

322
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:28,751
not make this boondoggle
any worse than it is.

323
00:26:28,751 --> 00:26:33,292
A dead body. I mean, we got
a real dead body, Guys.

324
00:26:34,834 --> 00:26:39,250
Ken, get Stanley on the hook.

325
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:46,042
The radio. Find out where the
backup is. Yes, Sir.

326
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:48,834
Stan

327
00:26:48,834 --> 00:26:51,999
Yeah, this is Stan. Stanley,
what's the 20 with our backup?

328
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:54,999
Over.
We have a bit of a problem.

329
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:59,999
They can't get no choppers to help
us till early tomorrow. Over.

330
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:03,999
So we're all on our own?
Over.

331
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:12,918
Stanley?

332
00:27:12,918 --> 00:27:15,042
Stan?

333
00:27:21,999 --> 00:27:24,667
Let's go have a look.

334
00:27:24,918 --> 00:27:30,292
Hey, you slugs. I'm 10 minutes
ahead of your bad guys.

335
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:40,542
Say, that six and 20 tootsie they
got with her, she sure is good-lookin'.

336
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:46,125
I'd like to pick them apples.
Eli, keep your short arm to yourself.

337
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:49,209
What's their position?
Over.

338
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,751
Ten minutes east of here.

339
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:55,125
Uh, say, Harris, uh,

340
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm thinking maybe we oughta get
the next pack of Johnny Laws...

341
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,709
to come in here and pick up
these flies.

342
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:05,292
We're gettin' into some..
some deep, serious now,

343
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:11,584
and I sure am gettin' that..
that old feeling again.

344
00:28:11,584 --> 00:28:13,792
I think I'm gonna..

345
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:17,375
I'm gonna break radio contact.

346
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:19,709
Out.

347
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:30,792
Damn fools are steppin' right
into the mouth of Satan.

348
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:48,250
Oh, my God!

349
00:28:51,626 --> 00:28:56,501
Do not, I repeat.. negative..
do not come up to this area!

350
00:28:57,918 --> 00:29:00,501
That really doesn't
sound good.

351
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:02,792
Fall back! Fall back!

352
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:05,417
Eli, come in.

353
00:29:05,417 --> 00:29:07,334
Eli!

354
00:29:07,334 --> 00:29:10,999
Eli! Come in!

355
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:17,999
That was no coyote, and we're
walking right towards it.

356
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:21,167
That's a good point, Kayla.
Let's hold up, you guys.

357
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:24,542
I'm gonna get reoriented here.

358
00:29:37,834 --> 00:29:40,542
Got yourself a man?

359
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:42,125
A woman?
You wish.

360
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:47,792
Nothin' to be ashamed of. As a matter
of fact, I will come to the wedding.

361
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:50,834
I'll even come to the honeymoon.

362
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:54,999
Let me get something straight
here. I don't quite understand.

363
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:58,334
Um, you drag me out into the
middle of the forest at gunpoint.

364
00:29:58,334 --> 00:30:01,999
You threaten my life if I
don't go with you.

365
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:04,999
And then you flirt with me.

366
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:07,292
Yeah.

367
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:18,918
Hey. Hey, where are you going?

368
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:40,042
Hey, how'd your yard sale go?

369
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:46,000
Hey, did you sell everything
you needed to?

370
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,459
Weneeded, Dad.
We agreed, right?

371
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:51,834
Yeah.

372
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:53,501
You hear about the robbery?

373
00:30:53,501 --> 00:30:56,334
Yeah. Phone's been ringing
off the hook.

374
00:30:56,334 --> 00:30:59,876
They shot him down right in
the middle of the street.

375
00:30:59,876 --> 00:31:03,584
I'm sure Harris has it all
under control.

376
00:31:03,584 --> 00:31:05,834
Zeff? Yeah.

377
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:08,999
Everybody's down at the diner.

378
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:12,125
Now they really got something
to talk about.

379
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:13,792
Poor Sirom.

380
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:17,000
This is really nice.
What's the occasion?

381
00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:20,667
Hmm?

382
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:23,584
Oh, God.

383
00:31:23,584 --> 00:31:26,999
I forgot.
I am so sorry.

384
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,542
I'm so sorry.

385
00:31:35,334 --> 00:31:37,792
Damn it!

386
00:31:37,792 --> 00:31:39,999
Chris.

387
00:31:40,042 --> 00:31:46,250
I tried to get word over to Stanley about
Eli, but I can't seem to get through.

388
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,834
You try then.

389
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:08,792
They were here.

390
00:32:08,792 --> 00:32:11,999
Damn, Robinson. Even I know
that, and I ain't no Injun.

391
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:17,918
Chris, you got anything else in that
skull of yours except for stereotype?

392
00:32:17,918 --> 00:32:19,083
Hey, I got lots in my skull.

393
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:23,292
Alls I'm sayin' is us rednecks got
just as much sense as you redskins.

394
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:26,250
Redskins?

395
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,626
Okay.
Then lead the way.

396
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:34,000
With pleasure.

397
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:45,999
Just catchin' my breath.
Let's head on up the valley.

398
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,292
They're still in the woods.

399
00:32:56,292 --> 00:32:58,209
Last radio contact said
something happened to old Eli.

400
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:01,000
We're positioned at Grizzly Peak.
We need those choppers by morning.

401
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,959
Is that doable Doin' our best, Stanley.

402
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:07,918
Copy that.
Son of a bitch.

403
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:15,834
Oh!

404
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:19,918
You scared the shit out of me.
Hey.

405
00:33:19,918 --> 00:33:21,083
Give me that.

406
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:25,375
That's okay. You can scare the crap out
of your crazy old man anytime you want.

407
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:29,876
I don't think you're crazy.

408
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:31,999
Yes.

409
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:37,999
I didn't forget about your birthday.
Oh!

410
00:33:39,626 --> 00:33:41,959
I knew you wouldn't forget.

411
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:43,542
You always come shining
through, Dad.

412
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:49,000
It's.. It's wonderful.
Your mother used to say that.

413
00:33:50,209 --> 00:33:50,999
Yeah.

414
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:55,876
You know what would be wonderful? If you
went back to school and got your degree.

415
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:57,083
Summer's over.

416
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:59,375
Well, at least you're not
telling me to get married.

417
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:02,959
I love what you've done to the
place, but I want my house back.

418
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:06,417
No, Dad. I don't wanna go.
I wanna be here with you.

419
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:09,999
I don't need a mother. I'm a
big boy now. I know that.

420
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:12,042
But not now.

421
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:14,501
Just not now.

422
00:34:14,999 --> 00:34:17,375
We wanted a girl, you know.

423
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:21,501
Your mother was in labor for 14 hours.
She was shakin' like a leaf.

424
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:27,459
I brought you, and I put you right on her chest,
and you both fell asleep just like that.

425
00:34:27,459 --> 00:34:29,417
I came home and planted a tree.

426
00:34:29,417 --> 00:34:32,959
I hadn't slept in 48 hours.
Forty-eight hours.

427
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:36,709
It's a good story, Dad.

428
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:40,209
Yeah.

429
00:34:40,209 --> 00:34:43,209
Yeah.

430
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:45,999
So I'll open this later, okay?
Yeah.

431
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:48,083
Okay.

432
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:50,626
I love you.
I love you.

433
00:34:50,626 --> 00:34:54,083
Bernardo, get a car over to Krista's.

434
00:34:54,083 --> 00:34:56,584
Tell her about Sirom.
Over.

435
00:34:56,584 --> 00:35:00,292
Oh, Sirom. Goddamn it.
Copy that. Will do.

436
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:04,626
Doggone it.

437
00:35:04,626 --> 00:35:07,999
You're supposed to be guaranteed
nationwide coverage.

438
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:08,918
Hey, grinnin' Vinnie,

439
00:35:08,918 --> 00:35:14,667
how about passin' your new girlfriend's
water around before we pass out?

440
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:19,209
Hey, you got any burgers in here?
Granola bars.

441
00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:20,751
Healthy stuff?

442
00:35:20,751 --> 00:35:24,999
You obviously don't like things
that are good for you.

443
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:27,999
Ooh! Porn.
Yeah, porn.

444
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:29,959
Why don't you go put it
in that VCR over there?

445
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:34,918
Vin, why don't you stop mucking about
and take the water out of the bag?

446
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,709
All right.
Drown yourself.

447
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:46,834
Hey, Robinson?
Yeah?

448
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:52,125
You think your ancestors are
gonna give us a tribal blessing?

449
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:55,792
You know, like from up
in the great powwow sky?

450
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:57,999
Keep us protected?

451
00:35:57,999 --> 00:35:59,083
I'm Mexican, you idiot.

452
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:03,292
The only Indian I ever knew was
the one that ran the cigar store...

453
00:36:03,292 --> 00:36:05,792
on Alvarado and 13th.

454
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:08,959
I always thought you were Indian.

455
00:36:11,918 --> 00:36:13,542
What in the world..

456
00:36:13,542 --> 00:36:17,999
What is all that gross stuff there?

457
00:36:17,999 --> 00:36:20,459
Is that blood?

458
00:36:23,334 --> 00:36:26,042
It's after birth from something.

459
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:29,876
We're clear.
No one's been here.

460
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:34,167
It looks like Eli was.

461
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:36,667
You think they shot him?

462
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:39,792
I mean, you think they really
killed him?

463
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:40,999
That's a strange smell.

464
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:45,334
What are we gonna do, Harris?
I mean, they're killing us.

465
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:48,999
Easy, Boy.
Focus on what we need to do.

466
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:49,959
Give yourself a goal.

467
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:55,999
We get ready to buckle our dust and find
these people before they can do this again.

468
00:36:55,999 --> 00:36:58,584
Come on, Son.

469
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:19,417
Where are you from anyway?

470
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:23,959
Yeah, well, welcome to my world.

471
00:37:23,959 --> 00:37:27,167
You think somebody owes you
something, huh?

472
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,999
Hell yeah, someone owes me.

473
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:32,999
I can look at you in two minutes and
tell you think someone owes you too.

474
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:36,626
It may not be money,
but it's somethin'.

475
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,667
Travis, she's just holdin' us back.

476
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:46,918
Wade, we may need to use her
as a bargaining chip, okay?

477
00:37:46,918 --> 00:37:50,999
What are you talking about, Man? If it
wasn't for her, we'd be long gone by now.

478
00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:52,999
If it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

479
00:37:52,999 --> 00:37:57,125
If Vin had been driving like I planned,
we'd be out of here right now.

480
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:59,083
It's my fault now?
Where's he all the time?

481
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:01,918
Oh, watch it. Watch it.
It's tricky around here.

482
00:38:01,918 --> 00:38:06,542
Oh, my goodness.
English guys.

483
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:10,167
Yeah?

484
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:14,918
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

485
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:18,999
Easy, Boy.
Knock it off, you big babies.

486
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:22,999
All right, all right.
Whoa!

487
00:38:24,876 --> 00:38:30,918
Okay, Guys.

488
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:46,918
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

489
00:38:48,501 --> 00:38:51,542
Geez. You know how many
rounds you just wasted?

490
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:54,042
What the hell was that?
Well..

491
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:58,667
You gonna be okay, Buddy?
Come on.

492
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:02,459
What are they shootin' at, an army?

493
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:10,751
Boy, you really did hit somethin'.

494
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:12,999
Jesus Christ, that's a lot of blood.

495
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:15,792
Yeah.
Is it human?

496
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:23,083
Looks like you got your first bear
there, Mate. Shut up, Travis.

497
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:25,167
Don't screw with me again, Vin.

498
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:28,167
Oh, come on, Wade.
I was just messin' with ya.

499
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:32,209
Yeah, very funny. Do you know
what your problem is, Mate?

500
00:39:32,209 --> 00:39:34,292
Everything to youis one giant
"E" ticket ride.

501
00:39:34,292 --> 00:39:40,334
It's just you in your little garden playing
Jesse James to impress all the girls.

502
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:43,417
You make me sick, Mate.

503
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:47,999
Ooh.
Guy needs his Viagra.

504
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:49,918
It's Prozac.

505
00:39:49,918 --> 00:39:54,292
Yeah, whatever.
Oh, shit!

506
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:13,250
Whoo!
You run pretty fast for a chick.

507
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:16,999
I knew those legs of yours
had to be good for something.

508
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:22,209
We shouldn't be out here! But
you just don't get that, do you?

509
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:24,000
Damn!
That's a good punch.

510
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,792
Where'd you learn to hit like that?
Boarding school cage fights?

511
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:30,751
Freeze!

512
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:33,999
Hold it right there.

513
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:37,626
All right,
let's everybody stay calm.

514
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:40,042
Shut up, Bitch.

515
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:43,584
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

516
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:50,626
Now, see, what we have here is
what's called a Mexican standoff.

517
00:40:50,626 --> 00:40:52,999
You ever done pulled that
trigger on somebody before?

518
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:56,959
You mean like you shot Sirom?
No.

519
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:58,959
Virgin hero, huh?

520
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:03,918
Freeze right there, mister,
or I'll.. I'll shoot you dead!

521
00:41:04,626 --> 00:41:07,876
Oh! Just kiddin'.

522
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,083
You hold him here.
Where's Harris?

523
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:15,626
I don't know. Started spoutin' off
that Vietnam gobbledy gook and ran off.

524
00:41:15,626 --> 00:41:18,542
Damn it, Chris!
What did I tell you?

525
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,751
You shouldn't leave him alone.

526
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:25,542
All right.
I'm goin' after the girl.

527
00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:28,792
You get that signal flare off.

528
00:41:34,584 --> 00:41:36,584
Hey, uh, you got a smoke?

529
00:41:36,584 --> 00:41:39,042
Oh, yeah, I got a smoke for ya.

530
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:42,167
This is the last smoke
you'll ever have.

531
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:46,709
You came to the wrong damn town
to rob the wrong damn bank..

532
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:50,876
Damn it.. and shoot at
the wrong damn law.

533
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:53,375
That's a lot of damns.

534
00:41:55,876 --> 00:41:58,000
Damn straight.

535
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:31,542
I never liked girls like you
in high school.

536
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:32,709
Graduating with honors,

537
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:36,751
all the boys, all the money, all
the luck, and no one owes you jack!

538
00:42:36,751 --> 00:42:40,000
I never graduated, Bitch!

539
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,918
Okay, Ladies, that's enough
estrogen boil-over for one day.

540
00:42:43,918 --> 00:42:46,209
Drop your weapons!

541
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:49,501
Give me your guns!

542
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:52,834
I'll give you a free round of what's
inside mine. How's that sound?

543
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:58,417
Don't kid yourself, boot. Right now, I'm
ready to put you all down inside a Glad bag.

544
00:42:58,417 --> 00:42:59,999
Relax, General Jackson.
This don't mean nothin'.

545
00:42:59,999 --> 00:43:03,999
We're just gonna take a little walk,
and then we'll let the lady go.

546
00:43:10,042 --> 00:43:12,584
How many men you have out there?

547
00:43:12,584 --> 00:43:15,417
How many have you got, you mean?

548
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:19,083
Hey, wanker, come out here!

549
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,459
Show your face!

550
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:51,292
Oh! Okay.

551
00:43:51,292 --> 00:43:53,709
Come on.

552
00:43:55,959 --> 00:43:58,459
Hello?
Come on. Just go in.

553
00:43:58,459 --> 00:44:02,959
Hello
Nope. Excellent.

554
00:44:02,959 --> 00:44:05,417
AWOL as usual.

555
00:44:05,417 --> 00:44:09,459
Harris, check the windows.
See if anything's coming.

556
00:44:09,459 --> 00:44:13,501
What's that foul smell in here?

557
00:44:13,501 --> 00:44:17,250
Don't see anything.
This is Old Harmonica's Lodge.

558
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,459
Yeah.

559
00:44:20,459 --> 00:44:22,959
Chris is out there.
Watch out!

560
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:25,292
Drop it, General.

561
00:44:25,292 --> 00:44:28,501
Hey!
Drop your gun.

562
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:31,667
Don't even try it!
The other one, now!

563
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:35,709
Okay, Stonewall, this unit's
gonna have one commander.

564
00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:39,834
And seeing as I'm the only one that's
registered, it's gonna be me, okay?

565
00:44:39,834 --> 00:44:44,709
You, go check him out.
See if he's gonna die.

566
00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:46,999
Go, go, go!

567
00:44:47,542 --> 00:44:50,999
Hey. Uh, he's hurtin'.

568
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:54,999
"He's hurtin'." What do you think,
I'm an idiot? I'm not a doctor!

569
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:57,792
You're a cop. I know what you know.
Looks like he has a concussion.

570
00:44:57,792 --> 00:45:02,167
He might have cerebral bleeding. He's gonna
need medical attention, that's for sure.

571
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:06,334
Good diagnosis. And what is this
place? It's an old ski lodge.

572
00:45:06,334 --> 00:45:10,334
Nurse, I want you to find a
room and put him to bed.

573
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:13,375
His wheezin' and sighin'
is driving me crazy.

574
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:16,501
Come on!
Yeah, that's it.

575
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:18,292
Whoa!
Hey!

576
00:45:18,292 --> 00:45:22,667
I'll blow a hole in you
if you move. All right.

577
00:45:22,667 --> 00:45:25,375
Now, would one of you guys
like to tell me...

578
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:28,999
what the hell just happened
out there?

579
00:45:38,999 --> 00:45:41,999
Well, well.

580
00:45:43,751 --> 00:45:46,584
What have we got here?

581
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:56,876
H.. He.. Help me.
Help me down.

582
00:45:56,876 --> 00:45:58,417
Sure.
Thanks.

583
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:09,125
How'd you find me?

584
00:46:09,125 --> 00:46:12,999
We don't get too many gigolos
wandering out here.

585
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:17,209
You another Dudley Do

586
00:46:17,209 --> 00:46:19,459
No.

587
00:46:19,876 --> 00:46:22,584
I'd choose my words if I were
you, city boy.

588
00:46:22,584 --> 00:46:26,584
You know, you should be careful
'cause if you sneeze..

589
00:46:26,584 --> 00:46:29,999
I'd say, "Kiss my ass," wipe
my nose and then walk away.

590
00:46:29,999 --> 00:46:33,999
Sheesh. So much for small town
hospitality.

591
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:37,334
Hey, Man, you spit on our streets,

592
00:46:37,334 --> 00:46:39,000
you rob our bank...

593
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,417
and you killed a friend of mine.

594
00:46:41,417 --> 00:46:45,042
This is small town hospitality,
you horse's ass.

595
00:46:45,042 --> 00:46:47,292
All right. All right.

596
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:50,000
Now, what were you doing
up the tree?

597
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,751
Well, it was that..
whatever that thing was.

598
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:57,918
That thing. The mutant gorilla..
whatever it was.

599
00:46:57,918 --> 00:46:59,999
Gorilla?
What are you talking about?

600
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:05,125
My melon's all twisted right now anyway,
so I know it's not Angelina Jolie.

601
00:47:06,459 --> 00:47:09,959
Think it bit me.
Think I'll turn into one?

602
00:47:10,042 --> 00:47:14,999
You're very colorful, aren't you?

603
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:18,999
What direction did it come from?

604
00:47:18,999 --> 00:47:21,501
That way.

605
00:47:21,501 --> 00:47:24,125
All right. Get up.

606
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:28,000
Move. Move!
Shee..

607
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,083
Easy, Paul Bunyan.

608
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:32,999
You're livin' on borrowed time, Kid.

609
00:47:32,999 --> 00:47:36,459
You know what it's like
to lose somebody you love?

610
00:47:36,459 --> 00:47:38,999
Do you?

611
00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:41,918
Move. Come on.

612
00:47:41,918 --> 00:47:45,125
You gonna help me?
Yeah, I'll help you.

613
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:47,375
Go.

614
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,626
You killed a cop.
Stop!

615
00:47:52,999 --> 00:47:55,125
Sit down.

616
00:48:16,999 --> 00:48:20,125
I knew we saw something, Baby.

617
00:48:21,542 --> 00:48:24,709
I wish you were here to see this.

618
00:48:24,709 --> 00:48:27,125
Who you talking to?

619
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:37,375
It smells like skunk and
mother's milk.

620
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:39,959
You didn't stumble onto this thing.

621
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:42,626
While it was foraging, you
threatened it in some way.

622
00:48:42,626 --> 00:48:46,626
Threatened what, Dude? I don't even
know what the hell's going on here.

623
00:48:46,626 --> 00:48:49,000
You have no idea?

624
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:52,792
You have no idea.

625
00:49:11,999 --> 00:49:14,334
Aw, Buddy.

626
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:21,459
Hey!

627
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:25,999
Let's find your friends.
Come on.

628
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:37,083
Actually, it was my older
brother that was in Vietnam.

629
00:49:37,083 --> 00:49:40,751
Golf Company, 2nd Battalion,
1st Marines.

630
00:49:40,751 --> 00:49:44,000
He got his balls blown off...

631
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,999
fighting.

632
00:49:44,999 --> 00:49:49,751
But as soon as he healed up, he
went right back in for another tour.

633
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:51,083
Proud son of a monkey.

634
00:49:51,083 --> 00:49:55,709
So, men of principles actually
do run in your family.

635
00:49:55,709 --> 00:49:56,999
Yeah. Either that or stupidity.

636
00:49:56,999 --> 00:50:01,751
I followed him into the service, you
know, but I never made it in country.

637
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:02,876
Hangnail kept me out.

638
00:50:02,876 --> 00:50:07,667
I'm definitely sorry to hear you didn't
get your chance to go over there.

639
00:50:07,667 --> 00:50:11,999
Course, when my brother came back,
he was the apple of my daddy's eye.

640
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:19,751
Me.. I could have burned the neighbor's
house down. He wouldn't even look at me.

641
00:50:23,667 --> 00:50:26,999
You know what it's like...

642
00:50:26,999 --> 00:50:28,792
to pray at night...

643
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:31,667
that your old man would care
enough about you...

644
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:35,959
to actually smack you once or twice?

645
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:41,167
Well, I'm sure he'll be
real proud of you now.

646
00:50:58,667 --> 00:51:00,626
Okay. Kayla?

647
00:51:00,626 --> 00:51:04,417
You and I are abandoning this position...

648
00:51:04,417 --> 00:51:06,125
and takin' all the artillery
with us.

649
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:09,334
We're goin' out there
without Wade and Vin?

650
00:51:09,334 --> 00:51:13,999
You wanna sit around here and
play peekaboo with Opie and Andy?

651
00:51:17,334 --> 00:51:19,167
What's that?

652
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:23,876
This is ridiculous.
Give us a gun! Shh!

653
00:51:23,876 --> 00:51:25,459
Vin?

654
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:27,334
Thanks for leaving me out
there, Dude.

655
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:32,999
Wild man, why don't you come in
the front door like a human be..

656
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:35,000
That's why.

657
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,375
You know, we've already been through this,
and frankly, I'm not gonna do it again.

658
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:41,999
You listen to me, Pumpkin Head.

659
00:51:41,999 --> 00:51:45,792
We can start shootin', killin' each
other right now. It's up to you.

660
00:51:45,792 --> 00:51:48,501
It's your choice.

661
00:51:48,501 --> 00:51:50,792
Hooah, Zeff.
Hooah.

662
00:51:50,792 --> 00:51:55,334
You all right?
Doin' good. Where's Chris?

663
00:51:55,334 --> 00:51:57,542
He's out there.

664
00:51:57,999 --> 00:52:00,959
Us good ol' boys are the only chance
you got of gettin' out of here.

665
00:52:00,959 --> 00:52:04,834
I don't think that's true, 'cause I think
there's a vehicle on the property somewhere,

666
00:52:04,834 --> 00:52:08,209
and we'll be driving away, laughin'
while your body's rottin' on the ground.

667
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:11,501
Why don't you just walk out
there and check it out?

668
00:52:11,501 --> 00:52:12,918
You go check it out!

669
00:52:12,918 --> 00:52:16,292
I know what's out there. What's
your guess, the Abominable Snowman?

670
00:52:16,292 --> 00:52:17,999
Actually, the Abominable
Snowman's Yeti.

671
00:52:17,999 --> 00:52:22,292
Lives in the Himalayas, uh, in Tibet.
I mean, it's a little manlike animal.

672
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:25,292
This guy's an encyclopedia
on this crap.

673
00:52:25,292 --> 00:52:29,792
Well, whatever it is.. and,
frankly, I don't care what it is..

674
00:52:29,792 --> 00:52:32,876
we left it about a half mile back.

675
00:52:32,876 --> 00:52:36,000
You bet.

676
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,125
Yeah, they're all around this place.
Big Woolly leading right up to the door.

677
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:46,999
Kayla, why don't you verify that lie?
What?

678
00:52:46,999 --> 00:52:51,959
Just go check outside the
front door, Honey, please.

679
00:53:15,042 --> 00:53:19,292
Travis! It's here.

680
00:53:19,292 --> 00:53:20,792
You satisfied?

681
00:53:20,792 --> 00:53:25,250
I'd say nobody has anything to worry about
except whatever's in front of these, okay?

682
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,792
Oh, will you shut up!
Seriously.

683
00:53:26,792 --> 00:53:30,209
Come on. Shoot. I'm right in front
of your big bad gun, so shoot me.

684
00:53:30,209 --> 00:53:33,167
Don't push him. Yeah, please
don't push me, Sugar Pants.

685
00:53:33,167 --> 00:53:35,999
You don't think I know you, Travis.

686
00:53:35,999 --> 00:53:38,999
Let me tell you something.
I am not scared of you.

687
00:53:38,999 --> 00:53:43,999
I just gave up everything I own
to leave a man exactly like you.

688
00:53:43,999 --> 00:53:48,000
What else are you gonna take
from me, huh?

689
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,584
What are you gonna do?

690
00:53:53,834 --> 00:53:55,501
Wow.

691
00:53:55,501 --> 00:53:57,751
Let me get this straight.

692
00:53:57,751 --> 00:54:00,999
You're telling me you can
get us out of here alive.

693
00:54:00,999 --> 00:54:03,999
I said we're the only chance
you've got.

694
00:54:03,999 --> 00:54:07,792
Now, take it or leave it.
I reckon I'd listen to him.

695
00:54:07,792 --> 00:54:12,542
Trav, we may need their help.

696
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:55,918
Is he gonna be all right?

697
00:54:57,292 --> 00:54:59,999
Maybe.

698
00:54:59,999 --> 00:55:03,542
If we can get out of here soon.

699
00:55:36,999 --> 00:55:40,250
Oh, that's nasty!

700
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,000
Ugh!
There's our smell.

701
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,167
It's Harmonica. I haven't
seen him for a few weeks.

702
00:55:47,167 --> 00:55:51,000
Uh, poor old fellow.

703
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,626
What a way to go.

704
00:55:54,501 --> 00:55:57,042
Just like the King.

705
00:55:59,626 --> 00:56:03,751
It's like taking out my
grandma's garbage,

706
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:05,626
multiplied by a thousand.

707
00:56:05,626 --> 00:56:08,999
It's not exactly my funnest moment.

708
00:56:23,999 --> 00:56:25,959
Ain't so bad out there.

709
00:56:28,292 --> 00:56:33,626
You know, at this point, it
could be a great white shark.

710
00:56:45,709 --> 00:56:50,501
Jesus Christ!

711
00:56:50,501 --> 00:56:52,292
Hold it!

712
00:56:52,292 --> 00:56:54,999
It's using rocks?

713
00:56:55,999 --> 00:56:58,918
This is crazy.
What's going on here is nuts!

714
00:56:58,918 --> 00:57:02,375
This thing is really making
me sick!

715
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:11,834
Oh, what is it?

716
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:20,000
That old guy had a phone
in here somewhere?

717
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,584
Nope. Always said he didn't
need one.

718
00:57:23,584 --> 00:57:26,250
Came into town about once a month,

719
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,584
bought himself some supplies.

720
00:57:28,584 --> 00:57:31,501
Quite a bit of horse feed.
Don't know why.

721
00:57:31,501 --> 00:57:33,167
Never had any horses.

722
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:37,959
Why? Wantin' to, uh, call the police?

723
00:57:37,959 --> 00:57:40,999
Very funny.

724
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:45,083
No, I'm trying to get a hold of Tim,
my stockbroker back in the world.

725
00:57:45,083 --> 00:57:48,584
He had a big deal that could
make me.

726
00:57:57,999 --> 00:58:01,167
Well, what's up?

727
00:58:01,584 --> 00:58:05,459
There's a girl in the street
in there after all, huh?

728
00:58:05,459 --> 00:58:09,667
The way you were starin' down
Travis like that..

729
00:58:09,667 --> 00:58:11,250
I tell you, this guy you left...

730
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:14,999
must be one hell of a rootin'
tootin' son of a bitch.

731
00:58:14,999 --> 00:58:16,792
That's good though.

732
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:20,459
You know, marriage..
it's over rated.

733
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:23,083
You know why divorce is so expensive?

734
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:26,375
'Cause it's worth it.

735
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:29,542
You just don't get it, do you?

736
00:58:29,542 --> 00:58:30,999
Go look in the mirror, Vin.

737
00:58:30,999 --> 00:58:35,999
But look really hard, past your
kiss-me smile and green eyes,

738
00:58:35,999 --> 00:58:37,501
if you can.

739
00:58:37,501 --> 00:58:42,167
I'm.. I'm just trying
to be a nice guy.

740
00:58:42,167 --> 00:58:45,375
Yeah, Mr. Nice Guy.

741
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:48,417
Uh, excuse me.

742
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:51,334
I'm just saying things to try
to make her feel better.

743
00:58:51,334 --> 00:58:54,709
Yeah, that's what you're
good at, isn't it?

744
00:58:54,709 --> 00:58:56,999
Priscilla.. you remember her?

745
00:58:56,999 --> 00:58:59,584
That cute little girl
down at the diner,

746
00:58:59,584 --> 00:59:03,959
dreaming of the guy that's gonna
come back and take her away.

747
00:59:03,959 --> 00:59:07,000
Or whatever sort of crap
you sold her.

748
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,918
She told everybody in town you
weren't part of the robbery.

749
00:59:10,918 --> 00:59:12,417
Hey, Chase.

750
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:15,999
You don't wanna make me mad,

751
00:59:15,999 --> 00:59:19,209
'cause I ain't as charmin'
when I get mad.

752
00:59:19,209 --> 00:59:22,626
Hey.

753
00:59:23,667 --> 00:59:25,999
Come and get it.

754
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:30,083
Your hitchhikin' days are over, Kid.

755
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:34,250
You're gonna have to be a man
or die tryin'.

756
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:37,042
That's a lead pipe cinch.

757
00:59:38,876 --> 00:59:44,334
You know I don't.. I don't
owe you an explanation.

758
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:48,292
No, you don't owe anybody
an explanation.

759
00:59:49,834 --> 00:59:53,834
But you're not foolin'
anybody now, are you?

760
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,501
Oh!

761
01:00:08,501 --> 01:00:11,999
Sorry, Ace.
Didn't mean to give you a start.

762
01:00:11,999 --> 01:00:15,125
It's all right, Zeff.

763
01:00:17,334 --> 01:00:19,999
How you doin'?

764
01:00:19,999 --> 01:00:22,209
Okay.

765
01:00:24,999 --> 01:00:29,999
It's like.. It's like being
back in country, isn't it?

766
01:00:32,751 --> 01:00:36,542
I just came to realize...

767
01:00:36,542 --> 01:00:42,709
that I should have given
your story a second chance.

768
01:00:44,125 --> 01:00:48,792
And when...
everybody was doubting you,

769
01:00:48,792 --> 01:00:51,999
I should have stood up for you.

770
01:00:51,999 --> 01:00:53,999
Hey.

771
01:00:53,999 --> 01:00:56,999
I surrendered that
a long time ago, Zeff.

772
01:00:56,999 --> 01:01:00,250
Don't even think about it,
for God's sake.

773
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:03,292
When you came to me...

774
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:05,918
lookin' for a job,

775
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,918
I let you down, Buddy.

776
01:01:09,918 --> 01:01:12,125
Let you down.

777
01:01:12,584 --> 01:01:15,999
Zeff, what kind of cop
would I have made?

778
01:01:15,999 --> 01:01:21,542
Oh, my. There's the guy.
He's a cop. Big Woolly cop.

779
01:01:24,375 --> 01:01:26,667
Ace,

780
01:01:26,667 --> 01:01:28,999
what really happened up there?

781
01:01:28,999 --> 01:01:31,709
I remember, clear as a bell,

782
01:01:31,709 --> 01:01:34,667
it was October the 12th,

783
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:37,375
10:00 at night.

784
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:38,999
I got a call from Sara,

785
01:01:38,999 --> 01:01:42,834
and she was up on Hatchard
Road, stranded.

786
01:01:42,834 --> 01:01:47,999
She had a busted water hose
I should have fixed a week ago.

787
01:01:47,999 --> 01:01:50,209
You know, we..

788
01:01:50,209 --> 01:01:52,501
Anyway,

789
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:56,292
she was standing there, pretty
as an angel, you know.

790
01:01:56,292 --> 01:02:00,083
She's got this camera that I bought her,
and she's running around like a school kid,

791
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:05,999
shootin' everything, tryin' to capture
everything as if it was the last time.

792
01:02:05,999 --> 01:02:07,751
Then, uh,

793
01:02:07,751 --> 01:02:10,501
there was this awful silence.

794
01:02:10,501 --> 01:02:12,999
Really, it hurt my ears.

795
01:02:12,999 --> 01:02:16,999
And then I heard this sound.

796
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:20,167
Ah, well, metal and flesh.

797
01:02:20,167 --> 01:02:23,209
The next thing I know, she's
in my arms, and she's..

798
01:02:23,209 --> 01:02:27,667
Her eyes are lost up in the
woods, up in the hills.

799
01:02:28,459 --> 01:02:30,999
And she's telling me,

800
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:36,459
"Oh, now I see."

801
01:02:38,876 --> 01:02:41,334
But now I understand.

802
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:44,584
Anyway..

803
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:52,999
You're grumpy today.

804
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:02,999
You are a grumpy..

805
01:03:02,999 --> 01:03:04,918
Havin' fun?

806
01:03:04,918 --> 01:03:08,751
grumpy, stubborn guy...

807
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:14,209
who doesn't want to face up
to the person he really is,

808
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:17,083
which is... Keep going.

809
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:18,292
someone..

810
01:03:18,292 --> 01:03:22,334
someone who cares about life
more than anyoneI've ever met...

811
01:03:22,334 --> 01:03:24,999
Keep it up.
I'm likin' it.

812
01:03:24,999 --> 01:03:26,876
and who...

813
01:03:26,876 --> 01:03:28,959
watches his family every minute,

814
01:03:28,959 --> 01:03:31,334
works his fingers to the bone.

815
01:03:33,459 --> 01:03:36,375
My old man told me one thing
that sure turned out to be true.

816
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:39,999
No matter how hard you try, no matter
how high you get in this life,

817
01:03:39,999 --> 01:03:42,876
there's always gonna be
a devil on the mountain...

818
01:03:42,876 --> 01:03:47,584
waiting to knock you back
into your socks.

819
01:03:49,083 --> 01:03:53,751
He said nothing was ever
gonna be easy.

820
01:03:53,751 --> 01:03:56,542
He was right about that.

821
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:04,209
Oh.

822
01:04:04,209 --> 01:04:08,584
Hey, somebody out there

823
01:04:08,584 --> 01:04:12,042
Holy mother. That thing's huge.
Flew like the wind too.

824
01:04:12,042 --> 01:04:14,209
Yeah? This is Chase Jackson.
Go ahead.

825
01:04:14,209 --> 01:04:17,250
It's coming your way.
What's coming my way?

826
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,999
Get out of the road, Honey.
What's coming my way?

827
01:04:19,999 --> 01:04:24,042
Have you seen it? I don't know
what that thing was!

828
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:29,999
My God!
That thing was huge!

829
01:04:30,999 --> 01:04:34,000
Oh, my dog.. my dog ran after it.

830
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:47,667
Stop, you son of a bitch!
Stop!

831
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,334
Hey.

832
01:05:11,876 --> 01:05:12,999
Hey, check this out.

833
01:05:12,999 --> 01:05:16,000
Um, I was walking to the bedroom
back there, you know, where..

834
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,918
And I decided to take a long, good
look in the mirror like you said.

835
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:24,999
And, uh, you know, the irony was...

836
01:05:24,999 --> 01:05:27,542
the mirror was cracked.

837
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:31,999
All right. That's cool.
I'll talk to you later.

838
01:05:34,417 --> 01:05:36,167
Why don't we go powder our noses?

839
01:05:36,167 --> 01:05:39,292
What happened to all the high
school animosity?

840
01:05:39,292 --> 01:05:41,918
Come on. Let's go.

841
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:58,918
I didn't think we were supposed
to have the lights on.

842
01:05:58,918 --> 01:06:02,000
Yeah, well, I do what I want.

843
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:05,292
No one gave you much in life,
did they?

844
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:09,834
No. Mm-mmm.
What I have I've worked for.

845
01:06:12,167 --> 01:06:14,834
What I have I stole.

846
01:06:19,584 --> 01:06:25,626
I don't have photos of ex-boyfriends
neatly tucked away in my purse.

847
01:06:26,709 --> 01:06:29,999
Those are my reminders.

848
01:06:29,999 --> 01:06:32,417
Vin?

849
01:06:32,417 --> 01:06:35,042
Oh. Yeah, right.

850
01:06:35,042 --> 01:06:38,375
Vin breaks hearts, not bones.

851
01:06:38,375 --> 01:06:41,876
Well, we all have scars.

852
01:06:41,876 --> 01:06:45,042
It's just that some of us
don't have the option...

853
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:48,375
to hide behind a pretty smile.

854
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,834
Shh!

855
01:08:51,834 --> 01:08:57,334
You look so much better
with your mouth shut.

856
01:08:57,751 --> 01:09:00,834
Come with me.

857
01:09:01,999 --> 01:09:05,417
Good morning.

858
01:09:06,918 --> 01:09:10,918
You know what I can't
get out of my mind?

859
01:09:10,918 --> 01:09:12,834
That if it wasn't for you,

860
01:09:12,834 --> 01:09:13,999
we wouldn't be here right now.

861
01:09:13,999 --> 01:09:18,999
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be here
right now. Don't answer back at me!

862
01:09:18,999 --> 01:09:22,459
You've caused enough trouble
as it is.

863
01:09:23,417 --> 01:09:26,999
One lousy instant and a
couple of feet.

864
01:09:26,999 --> 01:09:32,501
That's all that stood in the
way of us being rich and comfy...

865
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:35,999
and now being stuck here
with you.

866
01:09:40,999 --> 01:09:44,959
Maybe we can do something.

867
01:09:45,999 --> 01:09:48,250
Shall we?

868
01:09:49,292 --> 01:09:51,834
Drop it, Wade! No!

869
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,999
Ken!

870
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:09,209
Ken!

871
01:10:09,209 --> 01:10:13,667
No!

872
01:10:13,999 --> 01:10:17,999
Zeff, I'll go.
Just keep them headin' east.

873
01:10:17,999 --> 01:10:21,501
All right. Let's move out.
Come on, Honey.

874
01:10:21,501 --> 01:10:23,542
Where is that dead, uh,
Toilet Guy?

875
01:10:23,542 --> 01:10:27,584
Wait! Where's everyone goin'? No, we
should stay here. It's safe here, inside.

876
01:10:27,584 --> 01:10:30,959
Kayla, we need to get out of
here. It's not safe.

877
01:10:30,959 --> 01:10:34,000
You know what, Trav?
Keep my share.

878
01:10:44,709 --> 01:10:47,459
It's safer inside.

879
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:50,709
Safer to stay inside.

880
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:56,584
It's out there, you see.
It's out there. It's not in here.

881
01:10:56,584 --> 01:10:59,751
Stupid, dumb men.

882
01:11:02,209 --> 01:11:04,501
What?

883
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:07,417
Oh, my God.

884
01:11:07,417 --> 01:11:10,417
You were feeding it.

885
01:11:24,999 --> 01:11:27,999
Oh, Boy.

886
01:11:40,626 --> 01:11:42,876
Oh.

887
01:11:43,876 --> 01:11:45,999
No.

888
01:11:48,792 --> 01:11:51,667
No.

889
01:11:54,999 --> 01:11:57,459
You're a hero now, Buddy.

890
01:11:57,459 --> 01:12:00,125
All right.

891
01:12:09,999 --> 01:12:12,000
Eli!

892
01:12:12,334 --> 01:12:17,292
Chase. You can put that
shotgun down now.

893
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:20,459
I thought you bought the farm.

894
01:12:20,459 --> 01:12:23,999
No, hell. I'm not gonna let some
over ized rodent seal my tin can.

895
01:12:23,999 --> 01:12:26,459
Nah, I just had to pull
an over nighter here.

896
01:12:26,459 --> 01:12:29,999
I got a little thrashed around.

897
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:35,709
Oh, L.T.

898
01:12:35,709 --> 01:12:38,083
Long in the tooth.

899
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:40,167
It's been an interesting day, Eli.

900
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:41,999
How are we gonna get out of here?

901
01:12:41,999 --> 01:12:45,751
Well, near as my military
mind recollects,

902
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:49,417
we should be hitting pavement...

903
01:12:49,417 --> 01:12:51,999
before too long.

904
01:12:51,999 --> 01:12:53,667
We got people to find.

905
01:12:53,667 --> 01:12:55,999
Hey, look.
I'm gonna tell you something.

906
01:12:55,999 --> 01:12:59,375
If you ever tell me that you
saw the Loch Ness monster,

907
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:04,042
I'll be right there to back
you up.

908
01:13:11,292 --> 01:13:13,626
Okay.

909
01:13:13,626 --> 01:13:15,999
I've had enough of this group therapy.

910
01:13:15,999 --> 01:13:19,999
It's every man for himself.
You're going with us.

911
01:13:19,999 --> 01:13:20,999
Yeah, right.

912
01:13:20,999 --> 01:13:26,042
Hey, what, am I supposed to do
a buck and wing for you now?

913
01:13:26,042 --> 01:13:28,083
Boy, if I had been your father,

914
01:13:28,083 --> 01:13:30,999
I'd have tanned your hide
until you saw straight.

915
01:13:30,999 --> 01:13:33,999
But now, if it takes a bullet,
well, so be it.

916
01:13:33,999 --> 01:13:36,999
If you plan on pulling
that trigger again,

917
01:13:36,999 --> 01:13:38,999
I'm gonna give you
a slug in your heart.

918
01:13:38,999 --> 01:13:42,083
When I told you I wasn't going
back to prison, I meant it.

919
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:46,250
You want to stay here with me
and do this dance, that's fine,

920
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:49,375
but these people and this money..
they're gettin' out of here.

921
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:52,042
Do you want to split
this money two ways?

922
01:13:52,042 --> 01:13:57,584
Or, Vin, would you like
to split it three ways?

923
01:13:57,584 --> 01:14:00,459
Zeff!

924
01:14:02,999 --> 01:14:05,751
Oh, my God.

925
01:14:05,751 --> 01:14:09,083
Okay.
Uh, take a breath.

926
01:14:09,083 --> 01:14:13,999
Move over there. Sweetheart..
Just back off!

927
01:14:14,999 --> 01:14:18,459
Mother Teresa,
I can actually help him.

928
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:28,667
You know, I remember when I
just turned drinking age,

929
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:33,250
and my old man and I used to go out to
more drinking contests than I could count.

930
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:38,417
One night he pushed the limit.
I knew his ego'd get the best of him.

931
01:14:38,417 --> 01:14:42,959
We were stumbling down the
docks of Chesapeake Bay.

932
01:14:43,999 --> 01:14:44,999
I saw him take a big breath
of air.

933
01:14:44,999 --> 01:14:50,334
I thought maybe he was trying to get some
fresh sea salt down his gullet to sober up,

934
01:14:50,334 --> 01:14:51,918
but then he fell right on his face.

935
01:14:51,918 --> 01:14:54,292
I was bangin' and poundin'
and screamin' and cryin'.

936
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:57,999
I was trying to get that
busted old heart going!

937
01:14:57,999 --> 01:15:00,167
Come on, you busted old heart!

938
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:05,167
Live, you mean,
old son of a monkey! Live!

939
01:15:06,584 --> 01:15:10,999
But his heart never did
start up again.

940
01:15:10,999 --> 01:15:14,292
Yeah. Oh, Boy.
He was a mean old buzzard though.

941
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:16,584
A really tough buzzard.

942
01:15:16,584 --> 01:15:19,250
Vin! Vin!

943
01:15:21,292 --> 01:15:22,999
Thank you.
You're welcome.

944
01:15:22,999 --> 01:15:27,250
It's good to see you back. Just
don't tell any of my friends, okay?

945
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:30,167
Yeah.

946
01:16:08,459 --> 01:16:12,417
Travis?

947
01:16:12,417 --> 01:16:15,334
We shouldn't be here.

948
01:16:15,334 --> 01:16:19,999
This is his house.
Come on. Let's get out of here.

949
01:16:31,959 --> 01:16:33,999
You take cover.
Let me handle it. No more.

950
01:16:33,999 --> 01:16:36,501
You can't escape me anymore!
Kayla!

951
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:52,626
No! Kayla?

952
01:16:52,626 --> 01:16:57,459
She's my family, you stinking
sack of bad cheese!

953
01:16:57,459 --> 01:16:59,999
You son of a bitch!

954
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:13,083
Hey! Hey, you maggots.
Let's get this party moving.

955
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:14,584
Eli. Chase.

956
01:17:14,584 --> 01:17:17,292
We gotta split into smaller groups.

957
01:17:17,292 --> 01:17:19,584
Split up?
We're stronger together.

958
01:17:19,584 --> 01:17:22,375
No. That's the point.
We may be threatening him.

959
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:26,250
Chase is right. All right.
Now, listen, teen queen, Diddy Bop.

960
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:27,918
Head towards the sun
till you hit a road.

961
01:17:27,918 --> 01:17:32,584
We're gonna keep Big Woolly
off your back.

962
01:17:32,584 --> 01:17:34,918
Just go.

963
01:17:38,459 --> 01:17:39,999
We're still here, Zeff.

964
01:17:39,999 --> 01:17:43,918
Clocked and locked and ready
to rock, uh-huh. Hooah.

965
01:17:43,918 --> 01:17:47,501
Yeah.
All right, Gentlemen.

966
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:56,167
Old habits die hard?

967
01:17:56,167 --> 01:17:59,876
Hey, uh, I was wondering
if you'd do me a favor.

968
01:17:59,876 --> 01:18:02,667
I can't wait for this one.

969
01:18:02,667 --> 01:18:05,667
Just in case.

970
01:18:11,959 --> 01:18:14,999
You ain't really that tough,
are you, eh?

971
01:18:26,292 --> 01:18:28,751
Wade!

972
01:18:28,751 --> 01:18:31,167
You want the money?

973
01:18:53,626 --> 01:18:56,751
You think you're so smart,
don't you?

974
01:18:56,751 --> 01:19:01,999
You were gonna rip us all off and
take the money for yourself. I know.

975
01:19:01,999 --> 01:19:05,167
But you didn't count on me,
did you

976
01:19:05,167 --> 01:19:08,999
The weakest actually turned
out to be the strongest.

977
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:13,042
So just give me what's mine.
Give it to me.

978
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:34,042
Hey!

979
01:19:36,501 --> 01:19:39,334
Hey!

980
01:20:03,334 --> 01:20:05,876
Wait. Wait, wait.

981
01:20:11,375 --> 01:20:13,999
Okay.

982
01:20:19,876 --> 01:20:23,959
Go over by the girl.
Take her hand.

983
01:22:03,751 --> 01:22:07,334
Come in, Sheriff.
Sheriff?

984
01:22:07,334 --> 01:22:10,834
Sheriff, it's Stanley.
Do you read me?

985
01:22:10,834 --> 01:22:12,751
Sheriff, please.

986
01:22:12,751 --> 01:22:13,918
Stanley, you there?

987
01:22:13,918 --> 01:22:18,999
Over. Oh! Holy Moly!
Sheriff, is that you?

988
01:22:18,999 --> 01:22:21,626
Yeah. Yeah, it's me.

989
01:22:21,626 --> 01:22:25,584
Uh, sorry for the language, Sir.
What's your 20? Over.

990
01:22:25,584 --> 01:22:29,334
Uh, we're.. we're back
at the wreck site.

991
01:22:29,334 --> 01:22:32,999
Looks like we must have
come full circle.

992
01:22:32,999 --> 01:22:35,999
Mr. Jackson's daughter Raquel
has been here all night.

993
01:22:35,999 --> 01:22:38,083
She wants to talk to him.
Over.

994
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:43,083
Yeah.
Well, he's.. he's right here.

995
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:46,999
Chase?

996
01:22:46,999 --> 01:22:49,042
Who is it?
Raquel.

997
01:22:49,042 --> 01:22:52,918
This is Chase.
Dad? It's Raquel.

998
01:22:52,918 --> 01:22:55,999
Yeah. Go ahead, Honey.

999
01:22:55,999 --> 01:22:57,999
No, no. I'm fine.

1000
01:22:57,999 --> 01:23:01,792
We got some stuff to take care
of here. I'll be home soon.

1001
01:23:01,792 --> 01:23:05,501
Bye-bye, Sweetheart.
Bye. Hurry home.

1002
01:23:10,417 --> 01:23:13,334
Oh, God.

1003
01:24:05,999 --> 01:24:08,417
Hi.
Hi there.

1004
01:24:08,999 --> 01:24:11,083
Priscilla?
That's me.

1005
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:14,125
Uh, somebody wanted you
to have this.

1006
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:17,250
For me

1007
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:20,250
It's a whole lot of hope.

1008
01:24:29,292 --> 01:24:31,918
Oh!

1009
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:41,999
Well, there she goes.

1010
01:25:43,334 --> 01:25:45,751
You ready, Son?

1011
01:25:45,751 --> 01:25:47,999
Yeah.

1012
01:25:47,999 --> 01:25:51,542
Thanks for letting me stick
around for the finale.

1013
01:25:51,542 --> 01:25:57,000
Well, I know you didn't want
her to see you like this.

1014
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,292
The cuffs.
These, Dude?

1015
01:26:00,292 --> 01:26:01,375
These are cool.

1016
01:26:01,375 --> 01:26:06,334
It's these hand-me-downs you got
me in here that are embarrassing.

1017
01:26:06,584 --> 01:26:11,709
Well, better get used to
funny-looking clothes.

1018
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:15,292
Good one.

1019
01:26:20,999 --> 01:26:24,501
Hey, Harris. Think I would
have made a good sheriff?

1020
01:26:24,501 --> 01:26:27,542
Well, do you think I'd have
made a good bank robber?

1021
01:26:27,542 --> 01:26:29,999
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1022
01:26:29,999 --> 01:26:32,792
Some people are just
different people.

1023
01:26:32,792 --> 01:26:36,334
Yeah, I guess so.

1024
01:27:04,501 --> 01:27:05,999
911. What are you reporting?

1025
01:27:05,999 --> 01:27:09,000
We've got someone or something
rawling around out here.

1026
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,709
Did you see what it was?
Person or an animal or..

1027
01:27:11,709 --> 01:27:14,459
I can't tell. Alls I know is
that my sensor light came on.

1028
01:27:14,459 --> 01:27:17,751
And I just happened to glimpse and see
this thing running across the yard.

1029
01:27:17,751 --> 01:27:22,083
A good-sized man. Or something looks
like a man. I don't know what it was.

1030
01:27:22,083 --> 01:27:23,501
Just.. It ran across the yard.

1031
01:27:23,501 --> 01:27:25,751
You've had problems in the
neighborhood before?

1032
01:27:25,751 --> 01:27:29,459
Yeah, my dog was killed here just
recently. I don't know it was.

1033
01:27:29,459 --> 01:27:31,292
I don't want to go outside.

1034
01:27:31,292 --> 01:27:33,667
Jesus Christ!
Get somebody out here.

1035
01:27:33,667 --> 01:27:35,209
What's going on now, Sir?

1036
01:27:35,209 --> 01:27:37,709
That son of a bitch is about
6'9" I don't know.

1037
01:27:37,709 --> 01:27:40,167
Do you see him now, Sir?
Yes, I'm looking right at him.

1038
01:27:40,167 --> 01:27:43,834
Uh-oh. Is he in your yard, Sir?
'N yeah. God, he's big.

1039
01:27:43,834 --> 01:27:47,375
Okay. What's he doing in your yard?
'N he's looking at me.

1040
01:27:47,375 --> 01:27:49,626
And the guy is on foot, this..

1041
01:27:49,626 --> 01:27:52,999
I don't know what it's a big,
real big person.

1042
01:27:52,999 --> 01:27:57,125
That's all I can say.
