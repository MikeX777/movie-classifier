You are the widow of a hero.

00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:27,589
Your husband as a member of 
the French police served secretly.

He died pursuing his secret duties.

6
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,690
Now he is resting secretly

its parades on the boulevard.

8
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,779

15
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:03,819
Please don't think that 
my request is ill timed.

16
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,419
But will you allow the 
surety to care for this decoration

17
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:11,080

has been avenged by the guillotine?

18
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,119

See what you can get out of madame

00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,160
Laro.

41
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,369
All right. Sir. She doesn't like 
the police. Oh woman of rare judgment.

42
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:30,910
Don't do that.

43
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:32,779
You know, you love it, madam la prop.

00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,540

what can I do for you? 
Balance cigarettes, please?

46
00:04:41,769 --> 00:04:43,750
The same kind, please.

47
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,779
Now, uh, what do you want me to tell you, 
Jamie? Tell her that I'll meet her here at 7 30.

48
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:56,230
You want to be 
ashamed of yourself? Leo. Why?

49
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,010
E she looks tired.

50
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:01,390
She sells flowers all the 
evening and you keep her out all night.

51
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,910
Eugenie doesn't complain.

52
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:24,329
Cigarettes. What kind? Mind your 
own business? I want to shop Persia.

53
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,980

Thank you.

56
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,190
And there must be some mistake. I 
said cigarette. That is a cigarette.

57
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:50,320
Well, if that's a cigarette, 
what is gunpowder doing in it?

58
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,929
It's my opinion that 
it's some firecrackers.

59
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,589
Some of our highest class 
customers use them boys. I wish.

60
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,880
Show me a high class customer.

61
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,619
Well,

62
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,489
that love

63
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,109
is he high enough class for 
you? He just bought a box of them.

64
00:06:07,859 --> 00:06:11,290
His name is bought a box 
of those. He bought them for

65
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,670
firecrackers

66
00:06:12,859 --> 00:06:14,359
and I won't pay 25

67
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:14,760

68
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:15,369
I,

69
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,649
I want my money back.

70
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:17,859
I

71
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,910
set off the whole box 
right in the store. They

72
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:22,609
stuck in a nuisance. I,

73
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,010
but this is the,

74
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,679
well, who is,

75
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:34,390
I'm usually not a very particular man

76
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,579
but 20 Franks for

77
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,510
firecrackers here. You like one?

78
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,200
Where do you see 
even he doesn't like them.

79
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:45,820
And if a policeman don't like him,

80
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,660
they're worse than I thought I got.

81
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,380
Take him home. Keep a 
look out for Baron long

82
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:53,459
when he shows up

83
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:54,040
in the short,

84
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:57,130

00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:02,940
the flower girl will be 
at cafe cosmo pool at 7 30.

00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:07,209

chauffeur's uniform. Very good loo.

00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:10,570

88
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,279

99
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,500
give him this.

100
00:07:58,329 --> 00:07:59,619
You know what to do.

101
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,399
Pardon me?

102
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:31,519
I am in terrible trouble.

103
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,229
What?

104
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:35,219
I have a rendezvous with the 
most beautiful girl in Paris.

105
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,349
Is this

106
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:37,609
uh

107
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,090
but she is very beautiful.

108
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,039
Wouldn't it be terrible if I were late?

109
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,159
Yeah,

110
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,429
it would.

111
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,270
And then again being a man of the world,

112
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,530
wouldn't it be more 
terrible if I were ahead of time?

113
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:51,460
No, am I right?

114
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:51,950
Yeah.

115
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:54,830
And in short, could 
you tell me if it is 7 30?

116
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:01,429
You see,

117
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,409

What are you doing?

129
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:32,000
Fantastic.

130
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:37,169

It's lovely.

00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:53,330
And just what I need.

135
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,840
Where'd you get the money

136
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:56,789
selling garages?

137
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:00,710
And how many million would you 
have to sell to get a watch? Like this?

138
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:01,919
Only two little gardens?

139
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,010
You

140
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:07,929
there isn't some other man then

141
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,919
you aren't jealous.

142
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:11,369
Not at all,

143
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,340
darling.

144
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,739
Last night, a gentleman bought a

145
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:18,229
for five Franks

146
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,340
and a minute later he came back 
and looked at me in the strangest way.

147
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:25,390
Then he dropped 100 
frank note on my tray.

148
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,950
Eugenie. Are you trying to make me 
believe a man gave you all that money for a few

149
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:30,729
Guineas?

150
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,729
You've been out with him?

151
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:34,890
Yeah,

152
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:36,830
you don't either.

153
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:43,770
Leah.

154
00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:49,239

156
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,059
eat.

157
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,909
Jealousy is a terrible thing.

158
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,489
I like you to be jealous.

159
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,809
I had to be ashamed of myself.

160
00:11:58,059 --> 00:11:59,549
Will you forgive me? Never.

161
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,429
You seen it?

162
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,299

I told you to keep away 
from my daughter. Please

166
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,219
come with me. I'll take care of her.

167
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:22,419
You've done my girl enough harm,

168
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,229
Eugenie.

169
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,820
He'll have you on the streets. 
If you were a younger man, I please,

and hurry. I have to get straight.

178
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:10,900
I have no one else in the world.

179
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:13,950
I haven't seen you for days.

180
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,380
Come home tonight,

181
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,419

00:13:17,719 --> 00:13:18,270

00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,799
there she is.

188
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:51,950
No

189
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:54,510
of the

190
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:55,919
I think.

191
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:34,349
Yeah,

192
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,520
on the alarm, Mr

193
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,250
Duran,

194
00:15:21,969 --> 00:15:24,539
I took the liberty of waiting for you.

195
00:15:26,219 --> 00:15:27,119
Who are you?

196
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,549
What do you want here?

197
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:35,070
I've come here to find out about 
a girl you claim is your daughter

198
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,520
feel

199
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:39,349
is my daughter

200
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:43,510
don't try lying to 
me. I know your record.

201
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,859
I know your record.

202
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:55,059
Where did you find this girl?

203
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,400
She couldn't

204
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,919
even walk

205
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,599
when I got her.

206
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:03,929
I brought her up.

207
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,469
I couldn't love my 
own flesh and blood more.

208
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:14,690
But what is it to you?

209
00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:16,640
Who is you genie?

210
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,669
We see

211
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:26,820
free

212
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:31,049
a war orphan

213
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:32,780
from Moscow.

214
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:34,669
We can prove that

215
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,450
only my poor friend

216
00:16:39,469 --> 00:16:39,760
George.

217
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:43,380
He was an officer

218
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,619
and put the child in my arms.

219
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:52,460
He was murdered a few 
days ago. Only Downton

220
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,229
and yourself.

221
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:56,969
Yes.

222
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:05,030
The light hurts my eyes.

223
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,319
You don't mind?

224
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:16,180
Wow.

225
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:26,368
What time is Eugenie 
getting? She isn't here.

226
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:28,709
She hasn't been 
home at all. Not tonight.

227
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,060
It's funny

228
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,030
what

229
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,060
family

230
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,760
I regret madam Danton to have 
had to trouble you at this time.

231
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,670
But the 
identification of Doan as a friend

232
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,069
of your husband's was 
of extreme importance.

233
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,130
I understand. Thank you.

234
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:07,550
Crime of passion is never a mystery.

235
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,530
Leon Ronald's head is practically in 
the guillotine now, a natural conclusion.

236
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,609
But I don't agree.

237
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:17,660
Have you noticed the 
overdevelopment of the left hand?

238
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,890
A left handed man doesn't dip his 
finger in blood and right with his right hand.

239
00:18:25,949 --> 00:18:26,400
Yeah.

240
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:27,670
Careful.

241
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,030
The windpipe is completely severed.

242
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,219
Death was instantaneous.

243
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,290
Someone wanted to kill 
two birds with one stone.

244
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,089
Whoever murdered Anton Dove

245
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:45,219
wanted to get rid of Leon Reynold.

246
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:48,609
However, that's only a theory.

247
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,050
Bring Reynolds in here.

248
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,660
Wait a minute, a couple of cops.

249
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:11,530
What is it? What is that?

250
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:13,869
You'll find out soon enough,

251
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:16,290
Reynold.

252
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:20,250
I want to warn you that anything 
you may say will be used against you.

253
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,310
I understand all that. But 
suppose we get to the point

254
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:26,260
you're accused of the 
murder of Anton Doran,

255
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:28,910
Doran.

256
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,530
Where's Eugenie?

257
00:19:36,729 --> 00:19:40,750
Her disappearance makes it look bad 
for her too. Don't be absurd. Absurd.

258
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,469
Why that girl wouldn't harm a fly. Why 
she's a saint? A saint is a sweetheart.

259
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:48,270
I'll finish it for you. The 
saint is a sweetheart of a thief

260
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:49,430
but not a murderer.

261
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,339
Take him to Sante Prison and hold 
him until further orders. I'm not lying.

262
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:56,109
I didn't do it

263
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:06,939
just a minute.

264
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:11,180
Suppose we give you a 
chance to prove your innocence

265
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:15,829
as a thief. You have access to die 
is not exactly hospitable to the police.

266
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,239
I'm not a stupid. I know I'm merely 
asking you to clear yourself if you're innocent

267
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,339
and also your sweetheart.

268
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,270
Well,

269
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,069
it's a pleasure under the circumstances.

270
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:29,219
You may go.

271
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:33,060
When will I have the honor 
of meeting my coworkers again?

272
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:36,000
You'll be surprised

273
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:45,270
before you leave. I'd 
like to ask you one thing,

274
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,609
why does a fellow like 
you go in for Thievery?

275
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,349
Well,

276
00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:53,150
my father's body is 
part of the fortifications of

277
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:53,729
Verone.

278
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,380
My brother's body is lie at the

279
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:55,829
mine.

280
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,300
I have a few scratches myself.

281
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:00,800
The world owes me a living

282
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,640
the world but not France,

283
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,369
meaning precisely.

284
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,489
I'm very patriotic. 
I never love Frenchmen

285
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:16,319
cheekbone. Classification A one R

286
00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:21,160
I'll find type chin 11 4 A

287
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,819
Arian type I, right? Classification R 10

288
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,239
knows

289
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,420
aquiline nordic 17, 8

290
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,810
lip, lower

291
00:21:36,949 --> 00:21:39,020
Slavic type 15 A

292
00:21:48,469 --> 00:21:50,380
but there are no pictures of Eugenie.

293
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,979
How did you? This is a spoken portrait

294
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,400
in a case where no photograph exists.

295
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,979
We make one up from 
carefully checked descriptions.

296
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:16,160
A

297
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:16,709
girl.

298
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,640
That's all the day.

299
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:30,630
Come on.

300
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:34,729
I want you to criticize it.

301
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:36,280
Not be

302
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,109
quite a bit like her.

303
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:40,589
Well, that's fine. 
Wait for me in my office.

304
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:45,390
I want you to note 
these features carefully.

305
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,250
Find Eugenie do.

306
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,670
She's the key to the Doan

307
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,449
murder.

308
00:22:49,689 --> 00:22:54,300
Transmit spoke important to all 
undercover operatives, check all hospitals,

309
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:57,390
institutions, morgues and borders.

310
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,310
You'll be supplied with a 
facsimile on your way out.

311
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,439
That'll do.

312
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:08,319
Well, how's everything going?

313
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:11,050
Oh, everything's practically done

314
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,199
except for finding the murderer.

315
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,609
Rees

316
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:26,869
Princess Anastasia,

317
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:37,949
open your eyes.

318
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,510
It's all coming back to you.

319
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,280
It's all coming back to you.

320
00:23:50,449 --> 00:23:55,739
Your memory today is much 
clearer than it was yesterday.

321
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,150
Remember the day your 
father and mother were killed,

322
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,109
the guards didn't even let you dress

323
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,719
they ordered due to the seller.

324
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,739
Remember princess

325
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,020
who was there?

326
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,890
My father.

327
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,670
Well,

328
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,020
my mother, well,

329
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,469
my sister, well, and

330
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:29,030
they draw all of you into a corner. 
You can see them raising their guns firing.

331
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,599
Your father went down first. Then your 
mother. Please don't make me say it again.

332
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,969
Your eldest sister fell over you.

333
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,520
What did you see?

334
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,189
Rest our

335
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,719
princess.

336
00:24:51,729 --> 00:24:55,439
I believe her to be the lawful 
claimant to the throne of Russia.

337
00:24:55,939 --> 00:24:59,040
She has all the facial 
characteristics of Romanov.

338
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,689
She knows secrets which only a 
member of the royal family could know

339
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,160
found the missing daughter of the

340
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,099
late Sir.

341
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:09,680
Away

342
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:12,790
Rosy.

343
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:14,280
You

344
00:25:17,489 --> 00:25:19,069
don't believe princess

345
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:19,420
is

346
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:19,819
stay.

347
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:27,839
Yeah.

348
00:25:29,189 --> 00:25:29,209
Oh

349
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:53,780
yeah,

350
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,319
I understand. There's 
another claimant in Berlin.

351
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,479
Yes. But the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs is getting anxious about this one.

352
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,239
This sort of thing is a to 
become political and financial.

353
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,069
It isn't such a bad business being 
the Prince of Anastasia. Look at this.

354
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:33,219
There is a lot of money involved

355
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,750
and here's another 
little nest egg in London

356
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,099
B 12 and K 31. Work on the anesthesia

357
00:26:44,199 --> 00:26:44,750
case.

358
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:56,939
A 16 reports, no 
progress on the Eugenie Dorene

359
00:26:57,189 --> 00:26:57,939
case.

360
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,469
A 21 reports. Leon Reynolds 
sincerely cooperating with police to find girl

361
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,109
and wants instructions 
whether to arrest said Reynold

362
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,640
while hardly 
cooperating with the police.

363
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,359
Reynold has been 
collecting other people's jewelry.

364
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,280
We'll deal with that later on.

365
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:19,770
Well, the Schelberg bank case 
has been solved. So praise confessed.

366
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,000
Here's something interesting.

367
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:24,160
The court has been petitioned to appoint

368
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,400
a guardian for 
Princess Anastasia General Molo

369
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,699
guardian for the princess

370
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,680
and a little over a 
million pounds in the London Bank.

371
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:38,089
You don't think by any chance that a

372
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:40,910
million pounds might be 
of interest to general molo

373
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:45,270
come in

374
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:53,719
wars.

375
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:57,420
Confidential dossier contains this 
information concerning general molo

376
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,609
extremely magnetic personality 
lives, extravagantly source of wealth.

377
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:05,280
Unknown mother Manchu, 
princess, father Russian nobleman,

378
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:08,589
trace of insanity on father's side,

379
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,569
incidentally a 
charming fellow. This molo

380
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:19,599
Paris gowns won't change that street 
gon to a royal princess. I have royal blood.

381
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:22,430
I shouldn't put it on the 
stage. Not that flower girl.

382
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:24,209
You are becoming tired.

383
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:28,829
I've studied hundreds of 
faces and I found only one

384
00:28:29,189 --> 00:28:33,729
who is a perfect hypnotic subject 
and who also looks like a Romanov.

385
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,489
But that girl can't stand the 
strain. Why she'll lose her mind.

386
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,959
Well, if she does, then her 
guardian will rule Russia as.

387
00:28:40,489 --> 00:28:42,560
But you must realize 
too many people know her.

388
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:44,760
Not as many as you think.

389
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,500
If you have died,

390
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:05,900
identification is going to be 
difficult. The way your space is passed in

391
00:29:16,609 --> 00:29:19,849
the corpse can't be identified, but 
there's very little doubt that it's Lonzo.

392
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,270
Oh,

393
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,959
by the way,

394
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:25,219
I have Reynold 
outside. He knew the band too.

395
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,680
Here's a little 
souvenir of their acquaintance.

396
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:30,760
Chinese

397
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:34,239
rare ancient Jade

398
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,140
Renault seems to be quite a collector.

399
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:40,329
Oh, there's no doubt about that

400
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,569
K 31 reporting.

401
00:29:54,069 --> 00:29:58,280
K 31 reports she tried to get in Molo 
chateau, but the place was so heavily guarded.

402
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,319
It was impossible.

403
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,599
She caught a glimpse of 
the princess whose profile

404
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:05,130
cheekbone and chin line 
resemble the classifications of Eugenie

405
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:05,739
doin.

406
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,229
I'd like to know what's 
going on in that chateau.

407
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,280
I don't suppose we have 
any right to go in that place.

408
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:16,449
On the other hand, a 
burglar has, shall we say

409
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:18,290
poetic license

410
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,050
come in?

411
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:33,869
Won't you sit down

412
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,160
Reynold?

413
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,510
How would you like to,

414
00:30:43,989 --> 00:30:46,130
you forget, I never up Frenchman.

415
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:48,000
It's just a matter of form.

416
00:30:48,969 --> 00:30:53,829
How would you like to exercise 
those rare talents of yours poetically

417
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,219
at your service?

418
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,060
We want to find out what's 
going on in a certain chateau at

419
00:30:58,819 --> 00:30:59,900
this address,

420
00:31:00,989 --> 00:31:03,339
in particular. We want 
you to look for a girl.

421
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:08,089
You may find that she bears a slight 
resemblance to someone very dear to you.

422
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:10,510
You mean

423
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:11,579
Eugenie?

424
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,030
I must warn you that the 
place is heavily guarded. Pardon me?

425
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:20,750
I wouldn't advise you are 
trying to enter before midnight.

426
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,589
I won't insult your 
intelligence by suggesting

427
00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:27,579
how to enter a house.

428
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:30,060
Good afternoon.

429
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:13,910
Come here. Yes,

430
00:32:15,829 --> 00:32:16,959
you'll lose up the valley

431
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,359
princes,

432
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,390
Princess Anastasia,

433
00:32:57,589 --> 00:32:57,630
my

434
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:15,000
uncle Maxim,

435
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:17,520
Uncle

436
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,930
Maxim,

437
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,369
Uncle

438
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:23,449
Maxine,

439
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:26,920
uncle Maxine,

440
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:32,719
his imperial highness, the Grand 
Duke Maxim his excellency. The Count

441
00:33:32,829 --> 00:33:32,900
the

442
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:33,449
Moet,

443
00:33:36,739 --> 00:33:39,339
your imperial heights. General Mola

444
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:42,349
allow me to present count to Marseille.

445
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:43,300
Delighted.

446
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,369
I am honored.

447
00:33:45,739 --> 00:33:48,449
I shall inform the 
princess of your arrival.

448
00:34:14,408 --> 00:34:15,378
Your highness,

449
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,679
a royal highness,

450
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:01,179
the princess Anastasia.

451
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:13,060
Yes,

452
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,060
I go.

453
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,290
Maxine

454
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:38,080
were a mere child 
when I went off to the war

455
00:35:39,129 --> 00:35:40,739
and you still remember me.

456
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:46,030
Yeah,

457
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:47,860
older

458
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,000
and you look

459
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:54,199
tired.

460
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,090
Ok,

461
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:31,000
first your father, your mother 
and then your sister and soldiers.

462
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,290
And what happened? Then please don't 
make me see that terrible thing again.

463
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:42,580
You understand my dear child, why I 
oppress you with personal questions?

464
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:56,449
Are these the flowers you want? What you

465
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,290
come here here.

466
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:01,370
Leave it off the ballet.

467
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:03,479
God

468
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,659
rents

469
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,300
Princess Anastasia.

470
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:12,989
Yeah,

471
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:29,040
your highness come with me.

472
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,070
Our highness is nervous.

473
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,870
I am

474
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,949
yet your highness must acknowledge

475
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:26,310
that she has all the 
features of her. Romanov

476
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,699
General Mola.

477
00:39:35,949 --> 00:39:38,199
That girl is not the Princess Anastasia.

478
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,959
She's clearly a mental case.

479
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,129
I should advise you 
to discontinue this idea

480
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,429
or I shall be forced to 
notify the proper authorities.

481
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,520
I respect your opinion

482
00:39:52,939 --> 00:39:55,889
and admire your judgment, your highness,

483
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:59,270
but my faith in her is not shaken.

484
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,699
I shall have experts

485
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:05,189
test our mind.

486
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:50,280
The moment I met General 
Mullah, I had to present him of danger

487
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:51,939
was

488
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:52,399
no,

489
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,560
probably.

490
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:54,510
Yeah.

491
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:36,300
And the girl on the bed, well, I 
don't know whether she was asleep or dead.

492
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,959
You see they were right on my heels and 
besides, I didn't want to be in bad taste.

493
00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:43,300
So I just took two quick looks.

494
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:48,719
Are you always in such good 
taste? Oh, no, only when I'm in a hurry.

495
00:42:53,949 --> 00:42:54,679
Yes.

496
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,709
The grand,

497
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:59,020
the grand duke is killed

498
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:00,739
cray

499
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:03,469
embankment third accident in this spot

500
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:05,919
in exactly the same way

501
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:10,570
we'll investigate it once get the 
cars who's in charge, Cressie Lucian.

502
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,790
Lucian rope off the 
place, hold the witnesses.

503
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,370
No communications, get the search 
lights and the baby tests. Come on, Reynold.

504
00:43:16,379 --> 00:43:19,600
Strange coincidence. The 
Grand Duke just left Moloch.

505
00:43:33,979 --> 00:43:34,760
They all dead

506
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,850
for any witnesses.

507
00:43:37,479 --> 00:43:39,320
We're the buddy down man.

508
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:40,750
Come on.

509
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,550
Is this the man you saw at the chateau?

510
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,370
Yes, I'm pretty sure it is.

511
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,520
Come to my say

512
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,370
this was found on the chauffeur,

513
00:44:06,379 --> 00:44:10,139
this on the older gentleman 
and these on the man in uniform.

514
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:12,189
It's a lot of money for a French Officer

515
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:13,379
Marseille.

516
00:44:14,459 --> 00:44:15,629
It's a wealthy family.

517
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,179
Go right up and talk to General Mola.

518
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,370
Find a way to see that girl

519
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,500
but be very careful. You 
don't make the general suspicious

520
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:07,439
and what made them swerve off at 
this point. The other car didn't skid.

521
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,270
This is not a signboard,

522
00:45:21,439 --> 00:45:23,189
it looks like a moving picture screen,

523
00:45:36,219 --> 00:45:37,020
get some keys and I

524
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:37,399
miss,

525
00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:41,719
how do you help with those keys?

526
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,169
Could I be of any assistance? What do you 
mean? I think maybe I could open it for you.

527
00:45:52,689 --> 00:45:53,770
Thanks.

528
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,179
Why? That's a projection machine?

529
00:46:11,409 --> 00:46:13,149
A knock there sound equipment.

530
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:32,959
Mm.

531
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:34,300
Yeah,

532
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,790
I'm worried. Get

533
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:45,050
muon.

534
00:46:46,489 --> 00:46:47,060
What,

535
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:48,260
what

536
00:46:49,929 --> 00:46:49,949
it

537
00:46:52,149 --> 00:46:56,919
there are to be no more 
cut flowers? Is that clear?

538
00:46:58,209 --> 00:47:01,979
I am not a man that tolerates 
what you have allowed to happen here.

539
00:47:02,669 --> 00:47:04,659
Money and jewelry are missing.

540
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:11,090
That means there has been an intruder 
in my house. That is not to happen again.

541
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:12,560
Is that clear

542
00:47:16,449 --> 00:47:17,370
General Mueller.

543
00:47:25,419 --> 00:47:26,429
I want to see General Molo.

544
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,810
No, come in at night.

545
00:47:29,879 --> 00:47:30,429
Yeah,

546
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,010
this is my card.

547
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:40,989
You wait here, Justin

548
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:48,479
Ma

549
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:52,280
be wise to call a doctor. 
I'm afraid her reason is going.

550
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:58,070
The are

551
00:47:59,500 --> 00:47:59,919
my father

552
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:04,929
you needn't worry.

553
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:07,110
I've seen this happen before.

554
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,699
Every reminder of 
that tragic day upsets her.

555
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,790
All she needs is a rest.

556
00:48:12,989 --> 00:48:16,080
I shall stay with her. 
Don't make me see it again.

557
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,229
You must be very tired.

558
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,409
My good night.

559
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:28,379
Flowers,

560
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:30,780
please. Leon.

561
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,389
The opera

562
00:48:32,739 --> 00:48:33,560
11.

563
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,330
Leon

564
00:48:36,389 --> 00:48:37,270
lay on.

565
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:39,189
Yeah.

566
00:48:39,489 --> 00:48:40,530
General

567
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:46,159
stay here.

568
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,100
General Molo.

569
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,679
I am honored

570
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,229
by a visit from the

571
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:22,629
sit down, please. I regretted my 
visitors occasioned by very sad news.

572
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:24,989
The Grand duke or his highness.

573
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,830
He was here early in the evening, 
his automobile met with an accident.

574
00:49:29,229 --> 00:49:31,229
I'm sorry to say he was killed.

575
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:35,300
Oh, this is a terrible shock.

576
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:39,449
I hardly know what to say

577
00:49:42,419 --> 00:49:46,449
on the body of the grand duke was a 
communication for the princess, Anastasia

578
00:49:46,939 --> 00:49:49,510
that I am compelled to 
deliver to her. Personally.

579
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:58,800
I dislike disturbing her highness 
at this hour. I understand perfectly.

580
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,520
If you'll excuse me for a moment,

581
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:06,110
I will prepare the princess for this 
dreadful news and arrange for her to see you.

582
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:06,919
Thank you.

583
00:50:46,929 --> 00:50:49,830
I tried to break the 
news as quietly as I could,

584
00:50:49,989 --> 00:50:51,719
but the princess fainted.

585
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,219
I'm afraid any more excitement 
at this moment would be dangerous

586
00:50:55,409 --> 00:50:58,350
under the circumstances. I'd 
better come back tomorrow morning.

587
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:20,989
Get the motor boat ready. We 
are leaving by the secret passage.

588
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,189
Have the car meet us at high Bridge, 
telephone the airport immediately hurry.

589
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:24,870
Yes, general

590
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,030
should ask her.

591
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:35,129
You're ready for an emergency. 
Keep your eyes open. Stay close by go.

592
00:52:01,979 --> 00:52:02,320
You should

593
00:52:05,939 --> 00:52:06,820
you shame me?

594
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:08,270
Mhm.

595
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:13,330
Leon.

596
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,219
Leon,

597
00:52:24,899 --> 00:52:25,879
darling.

598
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:49,449
It was near this saw that

599
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:49,679
Lazos

600
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:50,949
body was found. Yes,

601
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,290
this must lead directly into the 
chateau. Why don't we go in the front way?

602
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,610
I want to surprise Muller. So he 
won't have a chance to destroy any evidence

603
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,310
up here.

604
00:53:41,699 --> 00:53:42,709
Break it down,

605
00:53:46,229 --> 00:53:47,959
still get the assembly to

606
00:54:07,919 --> 00:54:10,010
guard all entrances.

607
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:15,110
So you wanted to be more

608
00:54:15,409 --> 00:54:15,489
of

609
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,909
it will take more than the police of

610
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,429
pace to catch me.

611
00:54:22,879 --> 00:54:25,530
What a beautiful statue you would make

612
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:28,409
the most beautiful 
statue I have ever made

613
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,979
with a keen blade

614
00:55:03,379 --> 00:55:06,439
after the thirst. It is very peaceful.

615
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:09,350
It will not be like 
this for you. However,

616
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:35,010
you see how quiet she 
is now, how much like Mar,

617
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,780
I think we're just in time.

618
00:55:56,149 --> 00:55:57,449
Don't touch him. You'll be electrocuted.

619
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:05,199
We don't doubt you when you 
say that you're going straight,

620
00:56:05,209 --> 00:56:07,750
but we prefer that you 
do it outside of France.

621
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,919
You have just two 
hours to catch your boat.

622
00:56:10,209 --> 00:56:11,540
Good luck madam Reynold.

623
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:12,379
Thank you.

624
00:56:13,189 --> 00:56:16,649
By the way, all the time 
that you were helping us,

625
00:56:16,659 --> 00:56:19,639
we noticed that various 
pieces of jewelry disappeared.

626
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:21,719
We have a vague idea where they went.

627
00:56:21,969 --> 00:56:23,719
But would you mind telling me one thing,

628
00:56:23,949 --> 00:56:25,770
why were the counter Marseille's

629
00:56:25,939 --> 00:56:29,610
valuables left untouched? 
I'm sure he was a Frenchman.

630
00:56:34,219 --> 00:56:34,550
So

631
00:56:35,449 --> 00:56:35,639
about that,

632
00:56:49,929 --> 00:56:51,449
I never robbed Frenchman,

633
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:54,590
but I had to have a 
souvenir of our acquaintance.

634
00:56:56,899 --> 00:56:57,530
Come on down,

635
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:02,679
overtake that car and be sure 
Reynold doesn't miss the boat. Yes, Mr.
