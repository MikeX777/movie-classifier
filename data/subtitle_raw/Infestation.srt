2
00:00:57,315 --> 00:00:59,786
And we're
back from our commercial break.

3
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:01,486
When we left off
we were talking

4
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,488
to Chris in Fort Lauderdale.

5
00:01:03,923 --> 00:01:05,524
Chris, are you still there?

6
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:10,228
Chris?

7
00:01:10,262 --> 00:01:11,964
Annie, is Chris
still on the line?

8
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:14,834
Ugh.

9
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,669
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

10
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:18,805
I mean, I feel like there's...

11
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:21,540
I feel like I'm going crazy.

12
00:01:21,573 --> 00:01:23,009
All the evidence.

13
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:25,377
All the evidence says
that I'm not.

14
00:01:25,645 --> 00:01:26,713
Okay, Chris.

15
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:29,414
Just tell us, again,
what's going on

16
00:01:29,448 --> 00:01:31,450
so that people
who are just tuning in,

17
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:33,251
they can catch up to speed.

18
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:40,425
Well,

19
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:42,461
things have been coming
up missing and reappearing

20
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,563
in places I don't leave 'em.

21
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:45,898
I'm waking up
in the middle of the night

22
00:01:45,932 --> 00:01:48,668
and my nightstand's
always knocked over.

23
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:50,435
Blinds ripped down.

24
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:51,637
And they'd be these bruises.

25
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:54,372
Bruises keep popping up
on my legs.

26
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:56,676
It has to be aliens!

27
00:01:57,576 --> 00:01:58,477
Sol?

28
00:01:58,778 --> 00:01:59,277
Yeah?

29
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,880
Ask Chris,
what's his work schedule?

30
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,280
Annie, you don't
have to be nervous.

31
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,482
You can ask him.

32
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:05,017
Ask him, please.

33
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:05,584
Chris.

34
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,954
Chris, I don't mean
to cut you off.

35
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:10,589
But do me a favor
and tell me something.

36
00:02:10,622 --> 00:02:11,157
What?

37
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:13,592
I wanna know
about your work schedule.

38
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:15,628
My work schedule?

39
00:02:16,162 --> 00:02:18,296
I'm not really working much
right now.

40
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,431
I drive rigs.

41
00:02:19,464 --> 00:02:21,600
Big rigs for a water company.

42
00:02:21,634 --> 00:02:24,336
About nine months, I think.

43
00:02:24,369 --> 00:02:25,972
Okay, Chris, then so

44
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:29,374
you've been taking uppers
for like nine months?

45
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:34,312
And then now you quit because
you're on break, right?

46
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:35,447
Yeah.

47
00:02:35,715 --> 00:02:37,382
But I don't really...

48
00:02:37,683 --> 00:02:38,918
Well, Chris,

49
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,553
unfortunately for me
but fortunate for you,

50
00:02:41,754 --> 00:02:43,555
you're not being abducted.

51
00:02:44,657 --> 00:02:46,759
What? What?

52
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:48,560
Chris,
you're sleepwalking.

53
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:49,494
Sleepwalking?

54
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:50,529
You're sleepwalking.

55
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,563
No.

56
00:02:51,864 --> 00:02:53,766
Your body
has created an addiction

57
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,367
to these stimulants

58
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,369
and you've been on them
for like nine months

59
00:02:57,737 --> 00:02:58,738
and then you just stop.

60
00:02:58,771 --> 00:03:00,773
No, no, Sol.

61
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:02,340
That's not, that's not right.

62
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:03,341
Well, okay, Chris.

63
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,779
Well, just continue cutting
back on the stimulants

64
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:07,914
and you'll be fine.

65
00:03:09,048 --> 00:03:12,084
You know, no more bruises,
tipped over furniture.

66
00:03:12,285 --> 00:03:12,819
I'm okay.

67
00:03:13,252 --> 00:03:15,054
And voilÃ , you'll be back
to normal.

68
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:18,390
And with that, folks,
Annie's giving me the signal

69
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:20,660
that we are out of time.

70
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:22,094
Tune in tomorrow night
to see what

71
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:25,530
our brilliant Miss Annie
has in store for us.

72
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:26,966
So until then,

73
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,500
drive safe,

74
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:29,702
sleep tight

75
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:32,738
and keep an eye to the sky.

76
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:36,075
Seemed
a little off today.

77
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:39,779
Yeah, I haven't been feeling
right for the past few days.

78
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:43,716
I have these spots
that popped up on me.

79
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:45,685
No idea where they came from.

80
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:47,519
My heart was like
jumping around.

81
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,387
I went to the doctor,

82
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:52,892
he puts me on this heart
monitor for a month.

83
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:56,796
So I have to just wait
and see what happens.

84
00:03:57,063 --> 00:03:59,431
But it's strange.

85
00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:00,633
But enough of that.

86
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:01,868
Now,

87
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,501
with you,

88
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,171
what's wrong with your accent?

89
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,973
What're you having
a problem with it for?

90
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:09,574
Look,

91
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:11,509
I'm just not comfortable
doing it.

92
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:12,745
I appreciate you trying

93
00:04:12,778 --> 00:04:15,147
but I'd appreciate it more
if you didn't.

94
00:04:15,181 --> 00:04:16,849
Well, you know I'm
gonna keep pushing you.

95
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:19,085
Yeah, you wouldn't be you
if you didn't.

96
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:20,887
Well, on another note,

97
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,822
what tipped you off about
this last caller

98
00:04:22,855 --> 00:04:24,824
being a sleepwalker?

99
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:26,959
Well,

100
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,763
my dad, he used to work crazy
work hours when I was little.

101
00:04:30,796 --> 00:04:35,034
Sometimes, 25, 26 hours straight
just hopped up on coffee.

102
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,135
Oh.

103
00:04:36,534 --> 00:04:38,603
One day he lost his job

104
00:04:38,638 --> 00:04:41,974
and we started noticing
weird things.

105
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,844
Like, his tools would be
out of place

106
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:47,780
or the fridge door left open

107
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:50,149
or the car keys in the toilet.

108
00:04:50,548 --> 00:04:51,516
In the toilet?

109
00:04:51,549 --> 00:04:54,186
But the weirdest thing
was he had these bruises

110
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:55,955
all over his legs,

111
00:04:55,988 --> 00:04:58,658
so one night,
I stayed up pretty late

112
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:00,760
reading my mystery stories

113
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:03,495
and I heard footsteps down the
hall.

114
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:05,097
It was my dad.

115
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:09,835
So I follow him to his room
where my mom's dead asleep

116
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:13,471
and as he walks to the bed,

117
00:05:13,706 --> 00:05:15,942
he slams his legs
into the night stand.

118
00:05:15,975 --> 00:05:19,145
So that's the whole thing,
that's it, that's the story.

119
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:23,649
20 years I've been
dying to get a real story

120
00:05:23,683 --> 00:05:25,583
and as soon as it looks like
I have one,

121
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:27,485
you knock it right out
from under me.

122
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:30,622
But overall, a good night.

123
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:32,524
Well, yeah, that's true.

124
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:34,794
And no worries.

125
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:36,796
I'll be digging up a really
good topic for tomorrow.

126
00:05:36,996 --> 00:05:38,030
Yeah, I'm sure.

127
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:40,833
But in the meantime,

128
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:43,669
go home, get some rest, or
you'll be coming in here

129
00:05:43,703 --> 00:05:45,104
with bruises on your legs.

130
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,072
That's true.

131
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:48,074
All right, all right,
I will, I know.

132
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:51,978
Hey, guys, I don't mean
to break anything up.

133
00:05:52,011 --> 00:05:53,946
I was told to get
the studio prepped

134
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,815
for Fabian's morning show.

135
00:05:55,848 --> 00:05:57,650
Yes, sir, boss man.

136
00:05:57,683 --> 00:05:59,151
I guess that's my cue, so.

137
00:05:59,185 --> 00:06:02,221
Would you drop this
off at the break room?

138
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,555
Will do.

139
00:06:03,588 --> 00:06:04,190
Thank you.

140
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:05,925
Of course, sure.

141
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:10,262
Wow.

142
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:17,569
Goodnight, Annie.

143
00:06:17,703 --> 00:06:18,237
Goodnight.

144
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:19,138
Good show tonight.

145
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,006
Thanks.

146
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:42,955
Hey.

147
00:07:42,988 --> 00:07:45,091
That's not good
for your car, you know?

148
00:07:45,124 --> 00:07:45,658
Huh?

149
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:46,792
Just letting it
idle for so long.

150
00:07:47,193 --> 00:07:51,163
I read online it starts to
build corrosion in your...

151
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:52,798
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

152
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:54,733
I get it.

153
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:56,235
Strange guy by your car in
the middle of the night.

154
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,069
Mm-hmm.

155
00:07:57,103 --> 00:07:58,637
Yeah, look, I'm Jared.

156
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:00,039
I live like one door
down from you.

157
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:01,674
Watch you
almost every night.

158
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:02,508
Oh.

159
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:03,709
Oh, no, no, no, I
didn't mean it that way.

160
00:08:03,742 --> 00:08:06,078
It's a bad choice of words.

161
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:08,781
Look, I work
customer support online

162
00:08:08,814 --> 00:08:10,149
but I work it from my house

163
00:08:10,483 --> 00:08:12,118
and I'm kind of a night owl so
I take the graveyard shifts.

164
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:13,719
I usually pop out
at like one or two

165
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:15,721
and I see you pull in and
you fumble with your things

166
00:08:16,021 --> 00:08:16,722
as you go to your door.

167
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:17,790
Mm-hmm.

168
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,225
Okay.

169
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:20,292
I know Sol.

170
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,361
I mean, I don't know him,
know him.

171
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:25,131
I mean, he was friends
with my grandparents

172
00:08:25,164 --> 00:08:27,266
and I knew he sold you
his place out here, so.

173
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:28,100
Oh, really?

174
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:29,301
Yeah, yeah.

175
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:30,803
Okay.

176
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,704
Sorry.

177
00:08:32,004 --> 00:08:33,205
I guess that just me.

178
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:34,940
So, Jared?

179
00:08:34,974 --> 00:08:35,841
Jared, yeah.

180
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:36,675
Nice meeting you.

181
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:37,810
Likewise.

182
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:39,044
I just, I thought
it was kinda weird.

183
00:08:39,078 --> 00:08:40,880
You know, you pulled in a
lot later than you usually do

184
00:08:40,913 --> 00:08:43,716
and then you just
kinda sat here.

185
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:45,317
Well, yeah,
I might have zoned out

186
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:47,686
for a minute
or something but...

187
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,387
What time is it?

188
00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:51,957
What?

189
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:53,859
- What's wrong?
- No, wait.

190
00:08:53,893 --> 00:08:54,660
Wait, what's wrong?

191
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:57,696
Kidding me?

192
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,133
Is everything
all right?

193
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:02,234
Yeah, yeah.

194
00:09:02,268 --> 00:09:04,003
It's fine, it's just...

195
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:06,238
I just don't remember
driving home.

196
00:09:06,272 --> 00:09:07,907
I remember heading to my car

197
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,276
and then you knocking
on my window.

198
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:14,747
Highway hypnosis,
have you heard of it?

199
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,182
That's what it is.

200
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:18,184
Like, I drove from here
to Miami and back

201
00:09:18,217 --> 00:09:19,185
on one cup of coffee

202
00:09:19,218 --> 00:09:21,020
and I can't remember a thing.

203
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:22,988
I can't remember
why I drove out there.

204
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:25,791
I think it was for my training

205
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:27,927
or something.

206
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:31,297
Annie?

207
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,200
Annie?

208
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:35,434
Oh, yeah.

209
00:09:35,467 --> 00:09:36,335
- Sorry.
- Hey.

210
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,236
Look,

211
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:39,305
how about we get you
to your apartment?

212
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:41,740
I guess so, all right.

213
00:09:48,347 --> 00:09:50,216
Look, Jared, I'm fine.

214
00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:51,784
You don't have to do this.

215
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:52,652
Annie,

216
00:09:52,952 --> 00:09:54,753
at least let me fail at
being a gentleman on my own.

217
00:09:54,787 --> 00:09:56,255
Oh yeah, I know.

218
00:09:56,288 --> 00:09:58,457
Just trying to be nice, right?

219
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,392
Anyways, here we are.

220
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:01,260
Yep.

221
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:02,094
Here we are.

222
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:03,195
Here you are.

223
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:04,029
Thanks.

224
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:05,798
It was nice
to finally meet you.

225
00:10:05,831 --> 00:10:06,899
Yeah, nice meeting you.

226
00:10:13,539 --> 00:10:14,773
Hey,

227
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,309
this is against
my better judgment

228
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:20,079
but would you like to come in?

229
00:10:20,112 --> 00:10:21,780
Just have a coffee
or something?

230
00:10:21,814 --> 00:10:23,148
Yeah, sure.

231
00:10:23,182 --> 00:10:23,983
I've got time.

232
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:24,817
Okay.

233
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,484
Cool.

234
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:28,153
This is it.

235
00:10:41,066 --> 00:10:43,369
Water
is what gives us life.

236
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:47,072
It's a precious, limited
resource which is vital to our...

237
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:48,841
It's funny.

238
00:10:48,874 --> 00:10:49,508
What?

239
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:52,011
This.

240
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,848
I never expected it
to be this messy.

241
00:10:56,982 --> 00:10:58,017
Really?

242
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:00,886
It's like a bum became

243
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,421
a crime investigator
or something.

244
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:04,456
Okay.

245
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,826
There goes the point where you
begin failing as a gentleman.

246
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,329
Oh, no, no,
I don't mean it that way.

247
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:13,532
It's, it's refreshing
to see a woman

248
00:11:13,565 --> 00:11:15,267
that's so involved with her
work.

249
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:15,934
Hmmm.

250
00:11:16,502 --> 00:11:18,404
I can tell you're not
knee-deep in the latest fashion

251
00:11:18,437 --> 00:11:19,972
or running to the bathroom
every five minutes

252
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:21,073
to fix your face.

253
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:24,543
Okay.

254
00:11:24,576 --> 00:11:28,480
Have you ever successfully
given a woman a compliment?

255
00:11:28,514 --> 00:11:30,182
All right, look, wait,

256
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:33,052
you got coffee, right?

257
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:34,853
Yeah.

258
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:36,188
How about I make us a pot?

259
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:38,257
Sounds good.

260
00:11:57,976 --> 00:12:00,212
Looks like
you're all out.

261
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:02,214
Is ice water just as good?

262
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:03,082
Mm-hmm.

263
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:08,087
You know,

264
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:11,023
that was
an amazing show tonight.

265
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:12,925
Oh, you listen?

266
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,294
Friends with Sol.

267
00:12:16,395 --> 00:12:17,229
Kinda.

268
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,531
Yeah, I listen.

269
00:12:19,565 --> 00:12:20,399
I mean,

270
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:23,569
a lot of people think
Sol's pretty nutty but

271
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:24,937
I think he's right
on the money sometimes

272
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,972
with a lot of his stuff.

273
00:12:27,406 --> 00:12:29,375
I mean, that's...

274
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:31,510
That's clearly
why you work there, right?

275
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:32,779
I mean,

276
00:12:32,812 --> 00:12:34,681
you have to believe in all the
extraterrestrials and UFOs.

277
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:36,582
Oh, no, no, no.

278
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:39,485
Me believing in these show
topics isn't a part of my job.

279
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:42,254
I was actually hired because
I don't believe in this stuff.

280
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:45,090
Well, how does that
make sense?

281
00:12:45,124 --> 00:12:45,958
Well,

282
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,994
'cause I'm there to
disprove the little stories,

283
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:51,563
weed out the hoaxes.

284
00:12:51,597 --> 00:12:53,098
Find logic in the bigger ones.

285
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,168
All right,

286
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,103
I can see that.

287
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,141
It's kinda like religion.

288
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:05,477
Like how some one would
rather be preached to

289
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:07,647
by a former atheist turned
Christian

290
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,349
than someone who's been a
believer in God their whole life.

291
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:13,452
There's just something
more powerful

292
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:15,487
in the words of
skeptic-turned-believer.

293
00:13:17,456 --> 00:13:19,291
It's kinda genius, actually.

294
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,028
Especially once they
make you a believer.

295
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:46,653
Try and get some sleep, Annie.

296
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:30,663
To stay hydrated,

297
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:33,599
we must drink half of our
body weight in water a day

298
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:37,402
and that's why you should
drink Arch Filtered.

299
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:40,339
Our water is naturally
purified using the same process

300
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:42,541
that occurs in natural springs.

301
00:14:55,554 --> 00:15:00,526
You know what's on them
satellites come crashing down?

302
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,393
Diseases.

303
00:15:02,594 --> 00:15:05,264
Diseases we ain't even
got a name for.

304
00:15:05,297 --> 00:15:06,766
Space germs.

305
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,267
Can't
nothing live out in space, man,

306
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,101
not even germs.

307
00:15:09,134 --> 00:15:10,235
There's no atmosphere.

308
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:11,403
Odell, give my quarter back!

309
00:15:21,513 --> 00:15:22,080
Sit done, Smokey,

310
00:15:22,114 --> 00:15:24,583
you'll get dizzy again.

311
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:25,718
This machine has had it.

312
00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:27,553
Give my my quarter back, Odell!

313
00:15:27,586 --> 00:15:28,253
That's why I loaned you

314
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:31,156
that quarter in the first place.

315
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:35,594
Hey,
brother, do you speak English?

316
00:17:46,258 --> 00:17:46,893
Oh gosh.

317
00:19:05,403 --> 00:19:06,973
All right! All right!

318
00:19:09,341 --> 00:19:11,276
I'm coming, I'm coming.

319
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:22,789
Hey,

320
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:25,858
did you hear or feel
that a few minutes ago?

321
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:29,327
No, sorry, look Jared, I'm
still a little out of it, okay?

322
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,064
Look, I just came by
to check on you.

323
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:34,801
I came out to have a smoke
before I started my first shift

324
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:36,869
and I saw your car
was still here.

325
00:19:36,903 --> 00:19:39,471
So I figured maybe you
called off after last night.

326
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:41,606
No, what time is it?

327
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:43,608
You making a habit of this?

328
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,912
It's 6:49.

329
00:19:45,945 --> 00:19:47,479
What?

330
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:48,047
Shit, I am so late!

331
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:50,415
Okay,

332
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,417
look, Jared, I'm super late.

333
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,786
I have to get to work
right now, okay?

334
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,452
Sure.

335
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:55,453
I'll talk to you later?

336
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,555
- Sure.
- Okay, bye.

337
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:00,893
Hey.

338
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:05,965
Thank you for being a
gentleman last night.

339
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:08,034
Sure, just being
a good neighbor.

340
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:08,901
Sorry.

341
00:20:08,935 --> 00:20:10,136
Try to feel better though.

342
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:11,403
Okay, I will, thanks.

343
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:22,581
Hey, Sol, I'm sorry I
slept through my alarms.

344
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:23,749
I'm getting ready right now.

345
00:20:23,783 --> 00:20:25,617
I'll be there as soon as I can,
okay?

346
00:20:26,384 --> 00:20:28,821
Calm down, take a breath.

347
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:30,022
You're not in trouble.

348
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:33,993
We were just a little worried
when you didn't show up.

349
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:36,996
I know, I was just, I
don't know, I must have...

350
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:38,563
I just had a weird night, that's
all,

351
00:20:38,597 --> 00:20:39,866
but I'm getting ready right now

352
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:42,768
and I have a great
story for tonight, okay?

353
00:20:42,802 --> 00:20:44,136
All right, all right.

354
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,605
Stop apologizing.

355
00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:49,407
Just get yourself together
and get down here.

356
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:51,543
Okay, all right, thank
you Sol, see you soon.

357
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:54,446
See you soon, kiddo.

358
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,055
Taking a look at our
seven day forecast,

359
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:05,658
we've got plenty of clear
skies headed our way

360
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:08,961
starting with today at a
high of 87, a low of 81,

361
00:21:08,995 --> 00:21:10,897
bringing us into a little
cooler night tonight

362
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,599
with a high around 69 and
continued clear skies.

363
00:21:14,634 --> 00:21:15,968
And speaking of clear skies,

364
00:21:16,002 --> 00:21:17,435
Janis, I don't know if you
caught that

365
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:19,471
surprise meteor shower last
night.

366
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:20,940
We've had photographs
flooding in from

367
00:21:20,973 --> 00:21:22,574
our viewers in Gulf Breeze.

368
00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:24,110
Really beautiful stuff.

369
00:21:24,143 --> 00:21:26,478
Well those are some
beautiful pictures, Stan.

370
00:21:26,511 --> 00:21:28,513
Can't beat surprises like those.

371
00:21:28,546 --> 00:21:31,117
And to continue the subject
of the sky,

372
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,719
our next story involves
strange sounds

373
00:21:33,753 --> 00:21:35,587
heard from the sky
this morning.

374
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,924
The story has piggybacked
on the meteor shower

375
00:21:37,957 --> 00:21:40,726
and is one of the top
trending topics online.

376
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,861
Have you seen this?

377
00:21:41,894 --> 00:21:44,630
Or better yet,
have you heard this?

378
00:21:44,664 --> 00:21:47,133
The authorities' emergency
lines and new stations

379
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:50,535
have been flooded with
reports of strange noises

380
00:21:50,568 --> 00:21:52,638
being heard all around the world

381
00:21:52,672 --> 00:21:55,841
and just as close as our
backyard here in Gulf Breeze.

382
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,476
That's right, we've
experienced a first time taste

383
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,478
of "the sound" this morning.

384
00:22:00,512 --> 00:22:02,715
Our own news station
believed it to be a hoax

385
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:06,484
until researched proved this
is not to be an isolated event.

386
00:22:06,518 --> 00:22:08,220
There's more on this story at
11.

387
00:22:10,555 --> 00:22:11,190
Oh, come on.

388
00:22:12,524 --> 00:22:13,159
Let's see.

389
00:22:26,238 --> 00:22:28,540
"Gateway to Hell Found."

390
00:22:28,573 --> 00:22:29,208
"Superpowers."

391
00:22:33,545 --> 00:22:34,847
How is this not on the news?

392
00:23:05,577 --> 00:23:08,714
Okay, so I've never done
a blog before.

393
00:23:08,748 --> 00:23:11,017
This is my first one,
so here it goes.

394
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,919
So the other night I
heard this sound, right?

395
00:23:13,953 --> 00:23:14,586
Yeah, so I heard this sound

396
00:23:15,021 --> 00:23:17,189
and it was about three
o'clock in the morning

397
00:23:17,223 --> 00:23:20,960
and I thought it might be a
plane but it was continuous.

398
00:23:20,993 --> 00:23:22,728
I had never heard
anything like that before

399
00:23:22,762 --> 00:23:24,130
so I did some research.

400
00:23:24,163 --> 00:23:27,033
I found a video online
that was from Berlin

401
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:29,168
and I'm in Michigan but it
was the exact same sound.

402
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:31,871
Leave a comment if you know
or maybe you heard it too.

403
00:23:31,904 --> 00:23:33,105
I can't be the only one.

404
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,642
I heard the sound again tonight.

405
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:37,777
I caught the tail end of it.

406
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,712
It must've literally just
stopped.

407
00:23:39,745 --> 00:23:41,013
My boyfriend thinks
I'm screwing with him

408
00:23:41,047 --> 00:23:43,149
but I know I heard it again.

409
00:23:43,182 --> 00:23:45,051
If anybody else did, you
know, send me a message

410
00:23:45,084 --> 00:23:47,253
or comment or anything.

411
00:23:47,286 --> 00:23:49,088
Just let me know
somebody else heard it.

412
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:54,126
Okay,

413
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,728
I have finally caught it.

414
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:57,763
It's, I mean, it's like 3AM.

415
00:23:57,797 --> 00:23:59,765
But I finally caught it.

416
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,967
I've been waiting up every night
and I've finally caught it.

417
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:04,270
So I'm gonna
show you guys, all right?

418
00:24:04,303 --> 00:24:05,271
Here, here we go.

419
00:24:05,771 --> 00:24:06,839
All right.

420
00:24:07,106 --> 00:24:10,242
I don't know how he's sleeping
through this, it's crazy.

421
00:24:10,876 --> 00:24:11,777
It's like, it's louder

422
00:24:12,044 --> 00:24:12,878
than it's ever been before.

423
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:16,048
You guys must be able
to hear this.

424
00:24:16,082 --> 00:24:17,817
It's like this crazy metal
sound.

425
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:39,665
30?

426
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:42,968
30?

427
00:25:43,002 --> 00:25:43,836
44?

428
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:46,338
33.

429
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,075
37.

430
00:25:51,143 --> 00:25:52,178
21.

431
00:25:53,045 --> 00:25:54,079
14.

432
00:26:03,956 --> 00:26:05,891
Damn it.

433
00:26:25,811 --> 00:26:26,412
Hey.

434
00:26:26,445 --> 00:26:27,446
James.

435
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:28,214
Hey, Annie.

436
00:26:28,247 --> 00:26:29,415
You know I don't usually call.

437
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:32,251
But Sol said that you would
be here like 10 minutes ago.

438
00:26:32,284 --> 00:26:34,420
You know we can't do the show
without you.

439
00:26:34,453 --> 00:26:35,387
I know.

440
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:37,223
I know, I know.

441
00:26:37,256 --> 00:26:39,959
I'm right around the corner,
okay?

442
00:26:39,992 --> 00:26:43,195
I'll be there
in five minutes, okay?

443
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:44,897
Hey, Annie,

444
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,966
is everything okay?

445
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:49,435
No, yeah, it's fine.

446
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:50,803
I'm just...

447
00:26:52,371 --> 00:26:53,839
Stanton Road?

448
00:26:55,541 --> 00:26:57,910
How the hell did I get here?

449
00:26:59,445 --> 00:27:00,279
Um, yeah,

450
00:27:01,247 --> 00:27:02,081
I'm okay.

451
00:27:03,115 --> 00:27:07,253
I'll see you guys in a second.

452
00:27:42,021 --> 00:27:43,322
Yeah.

453
00:27:43,355 --> 00:27:44,156
Hey, Annie.

454
00:27:44,189 --> 00:27:44,990
Hey, Annie.

455
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,125
Hi.

456
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:54,466
Hey, James, watch this,
watch this.

457
00:28:02,608 --> 00:28:03,409
Boo.

458
00:28:05,077 --> 00:28:05,911
Seriously?

459
00:28:07,579 --> 00:28:11,150
So we had a case of
Sleeping Beauty, did we?

460
00:28:11,183 --> 00:28:13,118
Oh yeah, ha, ha,
really funny, very.

461
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:16,455
I don't know,
I don't know what happened.

462
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:18,290
I think I'm just in some
kind of funk right now.

463
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:19,858
Well don't go getting sick on
us.

464
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:22,961
You are what makes the
program interesting.

465
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:23,829
Hmmm.

466
00:28:27,232 --> 00:28:29,234
I have to check in on
studio one.

467
00:28:29,268 --> 00:28:31,970
If you don't need anything
else, that is, sir.

468
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:33,005
You're good to go.

469
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:34,641
We'll see you after the show.

470
00:28:34,674 --> 00:28:35,307
All right, kiddo.

471
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,584
Annie.

472
00:28:46,352 --> 00:28:47,319
Feel better

473
00:28:47,353 --> 00:28:50,589
and if you need anything,
just let me know.

474
00:28:51,658 --> 00:28:52,891
Will do.

475
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:57,062
Talk about a crush.

476
00:28:58,397 --> 00:28:59,398
How're you doing, kiddo?

477
00:28:59,431 --> 00:29:02,201
Ugh, all right, I guess.

478
00:29:02,234 --> 00:29:04,603
Just a little out of it, it
seems like.

479
00:29:04,637 --> 00:29:05,371
How so?

480
00:29:07,373 --> 00:29:10,275
I don't know, like
me oversleeping today.

481
00:29:10,309 --> 00:29:13,412
I mean, I knew I was tired
but four hours?

482
00:29:13,445 --> 00:29:15,114
And then I'm constantly thirsty.

483
00:29:15,147 --> 00:29:17,049
And what about now?

484
00:29:17,082 --> 00:29:18,384
Yeah, all the time.

485
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:19,686
Just, I don't know,

486
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:22,921
and last night I don't
remember driving home.

487
00:29:22,955 --> 00:29:24,923
I remember being home,
sitting in my parking lot

488
00:29:24,957 --> 00:29:26,458
but nothing else.

489
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:29,395
Oh, and thanks for not
telling me about Jared,

490
00:29:29,428 --> 00:29:30,562
that neighbor guy.

491
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:32,531
He came to my car,
knocked on the windows.

492
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:33,633
Scared the hell out of me.

493
00:29:34,734 --> 00:29:35,735
Gosh.

494
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:38,237
Annie, how can you
not see what's going on?

495
00:29:39,104 --> 00:29:40,139
What do you mean?

496
00:29:40,172 --> 00:29:42,374
Lost hours,

497
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:43,609
oversleeping,

498
00:29:43,643 --> 00:29:45,377
dehydration.

499
00:29:45,411 --> 00:29:46,211
Yeah.

500
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:47,714
This all speaks of...

501
00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:50,516
alien activity.

502
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:51,550
Ugh.

503
00:29:53,686 --> 00:29:55,487
See, I knew I couldn't
tell you this.

504
00:29:55,521 --> 00:29:57,589
I knew you wouldn't
take it seriously.

505
00:29:57,623 --> 00:29:58,957
But I am being serious.

506
00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:00,993
I mean, what other
explanation could it be?

507
00:30:01,026 --> 00:30:02,995
Oh, let's just save
it for the show, okay?

508
00:30:03,028 --> 00:30:03,663
Great.

509
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:07,667
Okay, look.

510
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:11,170
We have a few songs left
until we air,

511
00:30:11,203 --> 00:30:14,973
so I stumbled upon a great
topic for tonight, actually.

512
00:30:15,007 --> 00:30:17,976
I had something yesterday
but this is way better.

513
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:22,381
There's been reports
about this strange sound

514
00:30:22,414 --> 00:30:24,651
being heard thousands
of miles apart

515
00:30:24,684 --> 00:30:27,019
and nobody knows what it is.

516
00:30:27,052 --> 00:30:29,321
Not the NSA, not NASA,
not the government.

517
00:30:29,354 --> 00:30:31,623
Nobody has answers
to what it is.

518
00:30:31,658 --> 00:30:33,992
Well, it sounds like we
have a good show on our hands.

519
00:30:34,026 --> 00:30:36,528
You have no idea and
it's all right here.

520
00:30:37,764 --> 00:30:39,766
Tell you what, why
don't you get yourself

521
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,366
a strong cup of coffee,

522
00:30:41,935 --> 00:30:43,469
get one for me
while you're at it

523
00:30:43,502 --> 00:30:46,004
and I'll look at
what you have here.

524
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:48,207
Cool, sounds good.

525
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,274
Oh.

526
00:30:49,508 --> 00:30:52,511
I have a recording of
the sound right here.

527
00:30:53,145 --> 00:30:55,214
And we're going to play it.

528
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,665
Hey, when did we get that?

529
00:31:12,699 --> 00:31:14,099
Huh?

530
00:31:14,132 --> 00:31:15,234
When did we get that?

531
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:16,101
Oh, this?

532
00:31:18,103 --> 00:31:21,607
The station got a new
sponsorship from a water company,

533
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:25,043
so naturally they want to
put their product everywhere.

534
00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:27,579
Mm-hmm.

535
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:32,351
Well, folks, we're back

536
00:31:32,384 --> 00:31:34,654
and we're ready to hear
what out audience has to say

537
00:31:34,687 --> 00:31:39,224
about what can only be
described as "the sound."

538
00:31:39,258 --> 00:31:41,628
So, we'll be opening up
the lines for your calls

539
00:31:41,661 --> 00:31:44,429
and I believe Annie has
our first call ready to go.

540
00:31:44,463 --> 00:31:48,133
Mm-hmm, first we have Jack
from Cocoa Beach on line one.

541
00:31:48,735 --> 00:31:51,169
Hi, is this Jack?

542
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:53,105
Yes.

543
00:31:53,138 --> 00:31:54,039
This is Jack.

544
00:31:54,072 --> 00:31:55,407
And you're calling in
about the sound,

545
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,210
so go ahead
and tell us about it.

546
00:31:58,243 --> 00:32:00,078
Yeah, yeah, the sound.

547
00:32:00,112 --> 00:32:01,748
Here's how it went down.

548
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:03,615
A few weeks ago,
me and the buds,

549
00:32:04,483 --> 00:32:07,286
just camping out one night.

550
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:10,556
Well, we saw, I don't wanna
freak anybody out or anything,

551
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:14,092
but man, we saw
some crazy shit, man!

552
00:32:14,126 --> 00:32:15,828
Well, Jack,
what did you see?

553
00:32:15,862 --> 00:32:17,129
Well.

554
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:25,772
So,

555
00:32:25,805 --> 00:32:29,141
we're like camping out and
sitting around the fire

556
00:32:29,608 --> 00:32:32,745
and, like, all of a
sudden, out of nowhere,

557
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:36,181
I mean the sky just lights up

558
00:32:36,214 --> 00:32:39,484
and it was just awesome!

559
00:32:39,518 --> 00:32:40,519
So glorious.

560
00:32:41,553 --> 00:32:43,890
And then, all of a sudden...

561
00:32:43,923 --> 00:32:45,257
Something doesn't sound right.

562
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,458
Recheck his facts, please.

563
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:48,661
Okay, Jack,
so a few weeks ago

564
00:32:48,695 --> 00:32:50,630
you and your buddies
were camping

565
00:32:50,663 --> 00:32:55,133
and taking plenty of hits
off of who knows what,

566
00:32:56,335 --> 00:32:58,503
when a crazy spaceship took off

567
00:32:58,537 --> 00:33:01,273
but what you saw
was a space shuttle

568
00:33:01,306 --> 00:33:03,475
off the coast
of Cape Canaveral, Florida.

569
00:33:03,508 --> 00:33:05,510
- No way.
- And with that, folks,

570
00:33:05,544 --> 00:33:07,512
we'll be right back.

571
00:33:07,546 --> 00:33:08,815
Aren't you the one
who is supposed to be

572
00:33:08,848 --> 00:33:10,382
screening these calls, Annie?!

573
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:12,484
I'm sorry.

574
00:33:12,517 --> 00:33:14,386
I just thought he had
such a convincing story.

575
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:15,587
I thought you would
want to talk to someone

576
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:18,691
who had a firsthand account
of the sound.

577
00:33:18,725 --> 00:33:21,861
All right, now that
we have had our laughs,

578
00:33:21,894 --> 00:33:23,730
can we get back to business?

579
00:33:24,496 --> 00:33:28,935
All right, our next caller
is Mary from Gainesville.

580
00:33:28,968 --> 00:33:31,403
Well, folks, we're back
and we're ready to hear

581
00:33:31,436 --> 00:33:34,674
what our audience has to
say about "the sound."

582
00:33:34,707 --> 00:33:37,376
Okay, Mary from Gainesville.

583
00:33:37,409 --> 00:33:38,711
Mary, are you on the line?

584
00:33:38,745 --> 00:33:39,611
Hello, Sol?

585
00:33:39,646 --> 00:33:41,881
I'm a first-time caller

586
00:33:41,914 --> 00:33:44,383
and a first time listener

587
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:46,218
but I just had to tell you,

588
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:50,690
I know exactly what that sound
is these people are hearing.

589
00:33:51,658 --> 00:33:53,325
Fill us in.

590
00:33:53,358 --> 00:33:56,561
That sound is
the good Lord's trumpet

591
00:33:57,195 --> 00:34:00,399
calling his faithful to
Paradise.

592
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:01,834
Well, folks,
there you have it.

593
00:34:01,868 --> 00:34:05,270
Now wait a minute, Sol,
I'm not done speaking.

594
00:34:06,405 --> 00:34:09,241
Th good Lord is
calling his faithful

595
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:13,345
before the end of days.

596
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:15,414
So they can be saved.

597
00:34:15,447 --> 00:34:18,685
Well, Mary, if you're correct,

598
00:34:18,718 --> 00:34:21,453
have you heard
the good Lord's trumpet?

599
00:34:21,988 --> 00:34:23,690
Well.

600
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:25,457
Hello, Mary?

601
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:28,695
Well, folks, I guess she
heard the good Lord's trumpet.

602
00:34:28,728 --> 00:34:31,931
Well, in order to minimize
the crazies calling in,

603
00:34:31,964 --> 00:34:34,399
we think you should have
a little more information

604
00:34:34,433 --> 00:34:36,736
and our program director, Annie,

605
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:39,371
has dug up
some pretty interesting stuff.

606
00:34:39,404 --> 00:34:43,009
So we will let her tell her
tale and open up the lines.

607
00:34:43,042 --> 00:34:44,543
Annie?

608
00:34:44,576 --> 00:34:45,410
It's over to you.

609
00:34:48,413 --> 00:34:49,882
What are you doing?

610
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:52,384
I'm not reading the stories,
I just give them to you.

611
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:53,251
- Payback.
- Eh?

612
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:54,419
Payback.

613
00:34:54,453 --> 00:34:55,855
No.

614
00:34:55,888 --> 00:34:57,957
Sorry, folks,
I caught Annie off guard

615
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,892
but she's collected
her thoughts now

616
00:35:02,028 --> 00:35:03,295
and she's ready to go.

617
00:35:04,463 --> 00:35:05,464
Over to you, Annie.

618
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:11,303
Okay.

619
00:35:12,638 --> 00:35:13,740
This is Annie.

620
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:16,408
And...

621
00:35:18,845 --> 00:35:23,049
Within the last week,
authorities and emergency lines

622
00:35:23,082 --> 00:35:26,919
and news stations have
been flooded with reports

623
00:35:26,953 --> 00:35:30,857
of strange noises being
heard all around the world

624
00:35:31,556 --> 00:35:35,494
and the first big report
to break national news

625
00:35:35,527 --> 00:35:38,563
happened last week in Nevada.

626
00:35:38,597 --> 00:35:40,499
The second was in Berlin

627
00:35:40,532 --> 00:35:43,301
and the third was in Michigan.

628
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:47,305
Upon further investigation,

629
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:51,878
local authorities
were unable to pinpoint

630
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:54,847
an exact location of
the source of the sound

631
00:35:54,881 --> 00:35:58,350
due to the wide range
or reported locations.

632
00:36:01,721 --> 00:36:02,755
Again,

633
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:06,358
many people believe it's
just a wide-scale hoax.

634
00:36:06,826 --> 00:36:07,794
After a bit of digging,

635
00:36:07,827 --> 00:36:10,663
I found that these
sounds have been reported

636
00:36:10,696 --> 00:36:13,032
as early as 1991

637
00:36:13,065 --> 00:36:16,068
but there were less people
actually reporting it.

638
00:36:17,837 --> 00:36:19,705
And then just two days ago,

639
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:22,041
all reports of the sounds
stopped

640
00:36:23,375 --> 00:36:24,911
except for one place,

641
00:36:25,645 --> 00:36:29,548
right here in our quiet
town of Gulf Breeze.

642
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,618
The sound was heard
for the first time

643
00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:34,987
this morning around 3AM.

644
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:39,491
And with that, we would
like you to tell us

645
00:36:39,524 --> 00:36:42,895
what you think we could he
hearing under the stars.

646
00:36:44,964 --> 00:36:49,135
All right, Annie, now
before we take our break,

647
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:52,905
Annie told me that she has
a recording of the sound

648
00:36:52,939 --> 00:36:56,508
and we're gonna play it
for you folks right now.

649
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:36,581
Um, uh, um...

650
00:37:36,615 --> 00:37:38,383
All right, folks,
there you have it.

651
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:43,089
What do you think it could be?

652
00:37:43,122 --> 00:37:46,926
Give us your thoughts
when we come right back.

653
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:50,763
Two things,

654
00:37:50,796 --> 00:37:53,431
one, you did amazing
like I knew you would.

655
00:37:53,465 --> 00:37:54,166
Thank you.

656
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,534
It felt good.

657
00:37:56,568 --> 00:37:57,970
And two,

658
00:37:58,004 --> 00:37:58,838
game's over.

659
00:37:58,871 --> 00:38:01,974
I want a real phone call
when I get back.

660
00:38:02,008 --> 00:38:03,209
Yes, sir, boss man.

661
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:05,111
Seriously.

662
00:38:05,144 --> 00:38:06,913
No, yeah, I know, will do.

663
00:38:12,151 --> 00:38:14,153
"Under the Stars,"
this is Annie speaking.

664
00:38:14,186 --> 00:38:16,222
What are you
calling about tonight?

665
00:38:17,924 --> 00:38:18,691
Hello?

666
00:38:20,793 --> 00:38:21,627
Okay, I'm going to hang up

667
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:23,629
if you don't say anything,
caller.

668
00:38:25,131 --> 00:38:26,966
Hello.

669
00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:28,000
Yes, hey.

670
00:38:28,034 --> 00:38:30,468
This is Annie and you're
with "Under the Stars."

671
00:38:30,502 --> 00:38:31,503
I need to talk to you

672
00:38:31,536 --> 00:38:32,972
about the sounds in the sky.

673
00:38:33,005 --> 00:38:34,472
I know what it is.

674
00:38:34,506 --> 00:38:36,776
What it really is.

675
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:38,778
The Arch Corporation, it's them!

676
00:38:38,811 --> 00:38:40,746
They are the ones
that are make...

677
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,848
Okay, sir, please calm down.

678
00:38:43,515 --> 00:38:45,483
So you say you know what
the sound really is.

679
00:38:45,517 --> 00:38:46,953
Can you explain?

680
00:38:46,986 --> 00:38:48,721
Listen, I
don't have a lot of time.

681
00:38:48,754 --> 00:38:51,123
They are the ones that
are causing these sounds!

682
00:38:51,157 --> 00:38:53,125
It's like, I don't know, okay?

683
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:55,194
I don't know exactly but
it is making the sound.

684
00:38:55,227 --> 00:38:57,730
Okay, sir,
before I can put you on,

685
00:38:57,763 --> 00:38:59,932
I need just a little
more information, okay?

686
00:38:59,966 --> 00:39:00,933
Listen to me!

687
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:03,769
I work, worked for them!

688
00:39:03,803 --> 00:39:05,104
I escaped!

689
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:07,640
They are keeping something
there at the facility

690
00:39:07,673 --> 00:39:08,708
that is not human!

691
00:39:09,642 --> 00:39:10,810
It is pissed!

692
00:39:10,843 --> 00:39:11,877
It is dangerous!

693
00:39:11,911 --> 00:39:13,713
They have been
doing experiments on it

694
00:39:13,746 --> 00:39:15,982
and there's no telling
what it's gonna do!

695
00:39:16,015 --> 00:39:18,818
I know what they are, okay?

696
00:39:18,851 --> 00:39:19,517
Okay.

697
00:39:19,551 --> 00:39:21,053
Okay, I'll put you through.

698
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:25,157
We still have a little time
left.

699
00:39:25,191 --> 00:39:28,027
Can you tell me
what the sound is?

700
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,229
The sound is a physical
phenomenon caused

701
00:39:30,262 --> 00:39:32,732
when something tries to
cross over into our world

702
00:39:32,765 --> 00:39:34,033
through the tears.

703
00:39:34,066 --> 00:39:35,001
The sound is...

704
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:39,905
You're hearing matter being
translated into our world.

705
00:39:39,939 --> 00:39:43,541
You are hearing them come over!

706
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:44,844
Who's "them?"

707
00:39:44,877 --> 00:39:46,679
I was a lead engineer

708
00:39:46,712 --> 00:39:51,183
hired to work on a device
codenamed "Project Harmony."

709
00:39:51,217 --> 00:39:54,020
I saw something cross over
when I tried to turn it on

710
00:39:54,053 --> 00:39:56,255
and that's when it
made the sound.

711
00:39:56,288 --> 00:39:57,123
Okay.

712
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:00,926
I'm putting you
through now, okay?

713
00:40:02,228 --> 00:40:03,863
Just...

714
00:40:03,896 --> 00:40:04,964
Just a second.

715
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:11,237
You have a creepy caller
on line four.

716
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,905
He wouldn't give me his name.

717
00:40:13,372 --> 00:40:15,174
All right, folks,
and we're back

718
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:17,609
and Annie has a caller
on the line that

719
00:40:17,643 --> 00:40:20,646
apparently we really
need to talk to.

720
00:40:21,947 --> 00:40:24,050
All right, caller,
who am I speaking with?

721
00:40:24,717 --> 00:40:26,652
This is John.

722
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:29,221
Well, welcome to the
show, John, you're on the air.

723
00:40:29,255 --> 00:40:32,091
Everyone listening
must pay attention!

724
00:40:32,124 --> 00:40:33,993
Remember these words!

725
00:40:34,026 --> 00:40:37,129
The Arch Corporation,
Project Harmony.

726
00:40:37,163 --> 00:40:39,365
A device was built as a
result of Project Harmony.

727
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:42,234
This device replicates a
singularity here on Earth,

728
00:40:42,268 --> 00:40:43,269
manufacturing...

729
00:40:43,302 --> 00:40:44,737
space time.

730
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,305
Okay, I don't who where...

731
00:40:47,173 --> 00:40:48,641
Annie.

732
00:40:49,809 --> 00:40:52,211
Annie, we're losing him!

733
00:40:52,244 --> 00:40:53,245
Annie!

734
00:41:00,786 --> 00:41:01,954
Um...

735
00:41:01,987 --> 00:41:03,322
Our signal's fine.

736
00:41:03,355 --> 00:41:06,058
It's being cut from his end.

737
00:41:49,001 --> 00:41:50,002
What the hell is going on?

738
00:41:50,035 --> 00:41:50,936
Stay calm.

739
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,405
The backup lights
will be on in a second.

740
00:41:54,907 --> 00:41:56,108
A fire emergency

741
00:41:56,142 --> 00:41:58,244
has been reported
in the building.

742
00:41:58,277 --> 00:42:01,814
Proceed to the nearest exit
and vacate the building.

743
00:42:01,847 --> 00:42:03,682
Do not use the elevators.

744
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,188
Sol!

745
00:42:09,221 --> 00:42:11,157
Who are
you, my brothers and sisters?

746
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:14,093
Telling you that
we are not alone.

747
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,231
I want to remind you all
today that we are not alone.

748
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:22,768
We are not alone today.

749
00:42:26,005 --> 00:42:27,706
We have never been alone.

750
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,175
We will never be alone.

751
00:42:30,075 --> 00:42:31,343
"Why?" you ask.

752
00:42:33,045 --> 00:42:35,114
"How?" you ask.

753
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:38,450
You see,
my brothers and sisters,

754
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:41,053
we are in the presence

755
00:42:43,222 --> 00:42:46,091
of He who is called "I Am."

756
00:42:47,226 --> 00:42:49,361
The first and the last.

757
00:42:51,497 --> 00:42:52,765
The Almighty.

758
00:42:53,799 --> 00:42:56,068
We are in the presence of God!

759
00:42:57,937 --> 00:43:01,340
Do you believe Moses was alone
when he parted the Red Seas

760
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:02,741
to save his people?

761
00:43:03,976 --> 00:43:04,877
No.

762
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,045
Oh my Gosh.

763
00:43:06,078 --> 00:43:07,780
Do you believe
that David

764
00:43:07,813 --> 00:43:10,716
was alone when he slayed Goliath
to defeat the Philistines?

765
00:43:12,084 --> 00:43:13,118
No.

766
00:43:13,786 --> 00:43:16,789
Do you believe
that Noah was alone

767
00:43:16,822 --> 00:43:19,391
when he loaded two
of every creature

768
00:43:19,425 --> 00:43:24,263
on this green and beautiful
earth on to that ark?

769
00:43:24,296 --> 00:43:25,197
To rescue them

770
00:43:25,231 --> 00:43:26,899
from the Great Flood?

771
00:43:27,933 --> 00:43:29,068
No!

772
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,174
Okay.

773
00:44:42,207 --> 00:44:44,977
So things are starting
to get really weird.

774
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:48,314
I mean, like, really strange.

775
00:44:48,347 --> 00:44:51,016
I haven't heard the sound
in awhile but,

776
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:53,519
like, the other day,

777
00:44:53,552 --> 00:44:56,322
I clocked in at work

778
00:44:56,355 --> 00:44:58,190
and the next thing
I remember is leaving.

779
00:44:59,224 --> 00:45:00,559
I don't remember any of it.

780
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,294
I mean,

781
00:45:03,929 --> 00:45:06,498
that's eight hours
of my day that's just,

782
00:45:07,566 --> 00:45:09,068
just gone.

783
00:45:09,101 --> 00:45:12,171
Just nothing,
I don't remember any of it.

784
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,041
Yeah.

785
00:45:16,075 --> 00:45:17,309
We just talked
about this.

786
00:45:17,343 --> 00:45:18,377
You ramble on the internet

787
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:19,646
like some sort of freaking
psychopath and just...

788
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:22,614
I'm sorry, this
is actually happening though.

789
00:45:22,649 --> 00:45:23,615
I'm not crazy.

790
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:24,651
No!

791
00:45:24,684 --> 00:45:26,318
Nobody's coming to get you.

792
00:45:26,352 --> 00:45:27,886
This is getting really old.

793
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,655
But I don't know
what's going on!

794
00:45:28,688 --> 00:45:29,521
I don't know what's going on.

795
00:45:29,555 --> 00:45:30,790
I mean, I can't explain
any of this.

796
00:45:30,824 --> 00:45:33,425
Do you need to talk to
some sort of freaking shrink?

797
00:45:33,459 --> 00:45:36,929
Whatever.

798
00:45:41,266 --> 00:45:42,501
Sorry about that.

799
00:45:42,534 --> 00:45:43,369
Just, if...

800
00:45:45,337 --> 00:45:48,107
I'm really scared, so if
anybody knows anything,

801
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:51,043
you know, let me know, please.

802
00:45:51,076 --> 00:45:53,278
Message me
or leave a comment.

803
00:45:53,312 --> 00:45:55,914
Maybe you're going through
the same thing, I don't know.

804
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:05,157
So my boyfriend left me.

805
00:46:10,295 --> 00:46:13,031
We're together
for five years and

806
00:46:14,333 --> 00:46:16,502
he just ended it
like it was nothing.

807
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:22,141
It's not just,
it's not just him though.

808
00:46:26,311 --> 00:46:28,180
Like, my boss.

809
00:46:30,015 --> 00:46:31,483
My boss has been
really weird.

810
00:46:34,754 --> 00:46:36,656
It's not me.

811
00:46:36,689 --> 00:46:39,425
It's not me, it can't be me.

812
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:41,493
Everyone else is being weird.

813
00:46:42,428 --> 00:46:43,295
They're being weird.

814
00:46:43,328 --> 00:46:45,330
You know,
they're telling me things

815
00:46:45,364 --> 00:46:47,099
that I'm doing
that I can't remember.

816
00:46:49,736 --> 00:46:51,503
I think I'm getting sick

817
00:46:51,537 --> 00:46:55,240
because I keep throwing
up this black stuff.

818
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:56,709
I don't really understand.

819
00:46:58,745 --> 00:47:01,580
Is anybody else
going through this?

820
00:47:03,716 --> 00:47:06,285
I'm really scared and I
don't know what's happening.

821
00:47:07,352 --> 00:47:10,690
Please, comment or mail me.

822
00:47:11,423 --> 00:47:12,725
Anything, I just,

823
00:47:13,225 --> 00:47:15,628
I don't know what's happening.

824
00:47:35,414 --> 00:47:37,449
I figured it out.

825
00:47:41,153 --> 00:47:42,722
I figured it out.

826
00:47:42,755 --> 00:47:45,257
I figured it out, I did, I did.

827
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:47,125
You know, me losing time and

828
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:48,761
just everyone acting crazy.

829
00:47:49,629 --> 00:47:50,730
It's aliens.

830
00:47:50,763 --> 00:47:53,432
It has to be aliens.

831
00:47:53,465 --> 00:47:56,068
It is and it's them trying
to get into your brain.

832
00:47:56,101 --> 00:47:56,636
Can't get in.

833
00:47:56,669 --> 00:47:57,637
Bye.

834
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,806
If they can't get in,
then you're safe.

835
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,373
So I'm safe.

836
00:48:06,578 --> 00:48:08,213
They're not gonna get me.

837
00:48:08,247 --> 00:48:09,649
No.

838
00:48:09,682 --> 00:48:10,516
They can't get in.

839
00:48:30,435 --> 00:48:32,070
Hey.

840
00:48:32,104 --> 00:48:33,071
Hey, what's up?

841
00:48:33,105 --> 00:48:34,540
Sorry to bother you.

842
00:48:34,573 --> 00:48:36,776
Is your cable acting funny?

843
00:48:36,809 --> 00:48:39,646
Mine's under the fritz for
like the last half hour or so.

844
00:48:40,445 --> 00:48:41,446
What?

845
00:48:43,615 --> 00:48:44,616
I don't know.

846
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:46,552
I hadn't had it on
since I've been home.

847
00:48:46,585 --> 00:48:49,154
Would it be too much
to check to see if yours

848
00:48:49,187 --> 00:48:50,188
is the same as mine?

849
00:48:51,758 --> 00:48:53,091
- What's?
- Um.

850
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:54,359
You look flustered.

851
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:55,327
Did I, uhh...?

852
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,295
I didn't scare you, did I?

853
00:48:56,328 --> 00:48:57,262
Like bad timing?

854
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:59,732
No, it's...

855
00:48:59,766 --> 00:49:02,601
Sorry, it's okay, I'm just
a little, a little on edge

856
00:49:03,268 --> 00:49:05,604
- but you can come in.
- Sure.

857
00:49:05,638 --> 00:49:06,471
It's fine.

858
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:26,358
You can have a seat
if you want.

859
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,629
Or you can just stand.

860
00:49:29,662 --> 00:49:30,830
We interrupt your program
to bring you

861
00:49:30,863 --> 00:49:32,699
this breaking news story.

862
00:49:32,732 --> 00:49:34,499
A grizzly murder scene
has been discovered

863
00:49:34,533 --> 00:49:37,169
at the water filtration
company in Emerald County,

864
00:49:37,202 --> 00:49:38,771
just two counties over.

865
00:49:38,805 --> 00:49:41,139
Local authorities are
looking for this man,

866
00:49:41,173 --> 00:49:42,909
33 year old John Maner,

867
00:49:42,942 --> 00:49:43,743
believed to be

868
00:49:43,776 --> 00:49:45,778
- armed and dangerous.
- Seems okay.

869
00:49:45,812 --> 00:49:46,478
Yeah.

870
00:49:46,511 --> 00:49:48,848
Like I said, it comes and goes.

871
00:49:48,881 --> 00:49:49,882
But
we're asking our viewers

872
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:51,918
with any information
about the whereabouts of...

873
00:49:51,951 --> 00:49:52,852
You want a drink
or something?

874
00:49:52,885 --> 00:49:54,787
No, no, I'm covered.

875
00:49:56,388 --> 00:49:57,222
Okay.

876
00:50:23,716 --> 00:50:25,217
Are you sure you're okay?

877
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,653
Uh, yeah.

878
00:50:30,923 --> 00:50:33,726
Hey, you haven't been feeling
strange or anything, have you?

879
00:50:35,394 --> 00:50:36,228
Me?

880
00:50:36,261 --> 00:50:37,562
No.

881
00:50:37,596 --> 00:50:38,798
Aside from a bad burrito
I had the other day,

882
00:50:38,831 --> 00:50:40,232
I'm feeling pretty good.

883
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,267
Why, you getting sick?

884
00:50:46,939 --> 00:50:47,840
Okay, listen.

885
00:50:52,845 --> 00:50:53,880
Okay.

886
00:50:56,381 --> 00:50:57,582
You need to promise me

887
00:50:57,616 --> 00:50:59,886
you won't call me crazy
or anything, okay?

888
00:50:59,919 --> 00:51:00,953
Sure.

889
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,224
I wrote this
before I came home

890
00:51:06,258 --> 00:51:08,527
but I wasn't in control
when I was writing it.

891
00:51:09,696 --> 00:51:12,297
We just had
this weird phone call

892
00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:17,402
about this topic
I stumbled on and,

893
00:51:17,436 --> 00:51:20,472
you mention earlier, like,
strange sounds being heard

894
00:51:21,406 --> 00:51:23,241
all over the place, you know?

895
00:51:23,275 --> 00:51:24,309
Right.

896
00:51:24,342 --> 00:51:27,612
Okay, so, I talked to
this man on the phone and

897
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:31,349
I'm starting to write these
numbers and words but...

898
00:51:32,919 --> 00:51:35,922
It's like I'm just on
autopilot or something.

899
00:51:37,422 --> 00:51:40,292
This isn't even my handwriting.

900
00:51:40,325 --> 00:51:42,461
You get a weird phone call,

901
00:51:42,494 --> 00:51:43,896
you write these notes down

902
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:45,597
and then you black out?

903
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:47,734
I don't know, yeah.

904
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:52,604
I just have, like,
these gaps in time...

905
00:51:52,638 --> 00:51:53,505
Time gaps.

906
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:56,341
I don't remember anything.

907
00:51:57,409 --> 00:51:58,410
Can I have a look?

908
00:51:59,746 --> 00:52:01,246
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

909
00:52:10,823 --> 00:52:11,657
Whoa.

910
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:14,861
This is weird.

911
00:52:16,328 --> 00:52:17,496
Do you see something?

912
00:52:19,632 --> 00:52:21,033
Yes and no.

913
00:52:21,067 --> 00:52:22,434
Do you have a pen?

914
00:52:22,467 --> 00:52:23,301
Yeah.

915
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:27,472
Here.

916
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:31,443
This is an anagram.

917
00:52:31,476 --> 00:52:33,012
The letters in the sentence
have been reorganized

918
00:52:33,045 --> 00:52:35,514
so for the untrained eye,
it doesn't make any sense.

919
00:52:35,547 --> 00:52:36,615
Okay.

920
00:52:36,649 --> 00:52:39,685
But if you
rearrange the letters,

921
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:41,821
one of the sentences
I get out of it

922
00:52:41,854 --> 00:52:44,690
is, "They want to colonize."

923
00:52:47,693 --> 00:52:48,527
Yeah.

924
00:52:50,096 --> 00:52:50,897
I don't know.

925
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,665
The rest is
a little more complex.

926
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:55,868
It's like a big puzzle.

927
00:52:55,902 --> 00:52:57,804
You just gotta figure
out where the pieces go.

928
00:52:57,837 --> 00:52:59,038
And these numbers, here,

929
00:53:00,807 --> 00:53:02,440
they mean something and
I think it has to do

930
00:53:02,474 --> 00:53:04,342
with whatever you wrote down.

931
00:53:04,376 --> 00:53:06,611
Look, I'm not the best at this

932
00:53:07,113 --> 00:53:09,982
but I think I know somebody
that can figure it out.

933
00:53:10,016 --> 00:53:10,850
Okay.

934
00:53:11,984 --> 00:53:13,986
Whatever this is,

935
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:17,990
some part of you didn't want
you to know what it means.

936
00:53:18,858 --> 00:53:19,692
Oh God,

937
00:53:20,726 --> 00:53:22,360
you start sounding like Sol.

938
00:53:22,394 --> 00:53:23,863
No, no, no, no.

939
00:53:23,896 --> 00:53:25,998
Seriously, let me take these

940
00:53:26,032 --> 00:53:28,034
and I'll get this figured out.

941
00:53:28,634 --> 00:53:30,870
I trust you
with this, okay?

942
00:53:30,903 --> 00:53:32,370
Okay.

943
00:54:15,982 --> 00:54:19,417
"Sorry, the blog you are
looking for does not exist."

944
00:54:19,451 --> 00:54:20,086
What?

945
00:54:22,722 --> 00:54:23,555
Shit.

946
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:28,027
"Sorry, the blog you are..."

947
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:28,895
Shit.

948
00:54:31,063 --> 00:54:32,098
"Sorry."

949
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:34,834
"Sorry, the blog you are looking
for..."

950
00:54:49,514 --> 00:54:50,149
Jared!

951
00:54:51,684 --> 00:54:52,752
Hey.

952
00:54:52,785 --> 00:54:54,452
Where are you going?

953
00:54:54,486 --> 00:54:55,821
You look different.

954
00:54:57,156 --> 00:54:59,792
What did you find out
about the notes?

955
00:54:59,825 --> 00:55:01,994
I'm just going
to the dumpster.

956
00:55:02,695 --> 00:55:06,098
Come on, Jared, it's really
not the time to joke, okay?

957
00:55:06,132 --> 00:55:07,532
What did you find out?

958
00:55:07,565 --> 00:55:08,600
Where are my notes?!

959
00:55:11,503 --> 00:55:13,139
You're Annie, right?

960
00:55:13,172 --> 00:55:13,973
Yeah.

961
00:55:14,006 --> 00:55:15,473
And you're Jared.

962
00:55:15,507 --> 00:55:16,342
Yeah.

963
00:55:16,709 --> 00:55:19,045
And you've been to my
apartment two nights in a row.

964
00:55:19,078 --> 00:55:22,614
So now, if we're done
stating pointless facts,

965
00:55:22,648 --> 00:55:25,483
I really need you to tell
me what you found out, okay?

966
00:55:26,018 --> 00:55:27,853
Or give me my fucking notes!

967
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,560
Just hold on.

968
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,103
You really don't know
who I am, do you?

969
00:55:44,136 --> 00:55:45,938
Look,

970
00:55:45,972 --> 00:55:46,806
Annie,

971
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,075
I'm really sorry.

972
00:55:49,809 --> 00:55:52,745
I've been forgetting
a lot of things recently.

973
00:55:54,013 --> 00:55:56,115
What do you want me to do?

974
00:55:56,148 --> 00:55:58,784
If I've done something
to you, I'm sorry.

975
00:56:03,189 --> 00:56:04,724
Looks like you're all out.

976
00:56:04,757 --> 00:56:05,758
Is ice water just as good?

977
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:07,226
They're telling me things
that I'm doing

978
00:56:07,259 --> 00:56:09,628
that I can't remember.

979
00:56:09,662 --> 00:56:10,663
It's aliens.

980
00:56:10,696 --> 00:56:12,564
It has to be aliens.

981
00:56:12,597 --> 00:56:14,934
It is and it's them trying
to get into your brain.

982
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:20,239
It's the water.

983
00:56:22,875 --> 00:56:25,077
How many
did you have of these?

984
00:56:25,111 --> 00:56:26,245
None.

985
00:56:26,278 --> 00:56:27,680
Maybe since yesterday.

986
00:56:28,714 --> 00:56:29,749
Okay, good.

987
00:56:30,983 --> 00:56:32,885
This is going
to sound strange but

988
00:56:33,719 --> 00:56:36,756
don't drink
any more of these, okay?

989
00:56:36,789 --> 00:56:37,622
Sure.

990
00:56:41,927 --> 00:56:43,262
Sol.

991
00:56:43,295 --> 00:56:45,231
I need to get to Sol.

992
00:56:45,264 --> 00:56:47,199
I know what to do.

993
00:56:47,233 --> 00:56:49,702
Oh my God.

994
00:58:10,216 --> 00:58:11,684
Hey, hey, hey.

995
00:58:11,717 --> 00:58:12,952
Where's the fire?

996
00:58:12,985 --> 00:58:15,221
Sorry, sir, I didn't see you.

997
00:58:15,254 --> 00:58:16,288
James?

998
00:58:18,424 --> 00:58:20,159
Yeah, I know, it's different.

999
00:58:21,127 --> 00:58:22,394
Yeah.

1000
00:58:22,428 --> 00:58:23,662
I don't know.

1001
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:27,333
This morning I just woke up

1002
00:58:29,135 --> 00:58:30,836
and just felt,

1003
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:34,073
new.

1004
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:39,879
Sorry, where are my manners?

1005
00:58:40,846 --> 00:58:41,914
Oh, no, thank you.

1006
00:58:43,015 --> 00:58:43,983
It's ice cold.

1007
00:58:45,751 --> 00:58:47,319
Yeah, thank you but no.

1008
00:58:58,397 --> 00:58:59,932
Annie.

1009
00:59:24,089 --> 00:59:24,924
Sol?

1010
00:59:30,162 --> 00:59:31,230
How are you today, Annie?

1011
00:59:34,099 --> 00:59:36,936
Sorry, I was just looking
for...

1012
00:59:36,969 --> 00:59:38,204
Didn't mean to scare you.

1013
00:59:38,237 --> 00:59:39,738
Sol?

1014
00:59:39,772 --> 00:59:41,373
No, it's find.

1015
00:59:43,275 --> 00:59:45,110
I just need to talk to you,
okay?

1016
00:59:46,111 --> 00:59:46,946
Wait.

1017
00:59:57,323 --> 00:59:59,992
I think you were right
about everything you said.

1018
01:00:00,025 --> 01:00:02,094
I think everything
I had going on

1019
01:00:02,127 --> 01:00:04,063
has to do with...

1020
01:00:04,096 --> 01:00:05,130
Aliens.

1021
01:00:07,166 --> 01:00:09,201
Just get ahold
of yourself, Annie.

1022
01:00:09,735 --> 01:00:13,172
Stay hydrated, you'll get
back in the swing of things.

1023
01:00:14,974 --> 01:00:17,243
Where's
your coffee, Sol?

1024
01:00:17,276 --> 01:00:18,877
That's something, isn't it?

1025
01:00:21,113 --> 01:00:23,148
No more marks on me.

1026
01:00:23,182 --> 01:00:24,783
No more heart monitor.

1027
01:00:26,452 --> 01:00:28,254
I have to get ready
for the show.

1028
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:30,289
They have everything ready
for me to go.

1029
01:00:32,391 --> 01:00:33,425
What do you mean?

1030
01:00:33,459 --> 01:00:34,426
I haven't even
prepared anything.

1031
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,095
Look,

1032
01:00:36,128 --> 01:00:38,397
there are bigger things
going on right now, okay?

1033
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,032
You need to listen to me.

1034
01:00:40,065 --> 01:00:41,333
Things have changed, Annie.

1035
01:00:42,568 --> 01:00:45,838
I want to go into
a different direction

1036
01:00:46,472 --> 01:00:47,973
with the classics

1037
01:00:49,942 --> 01:00:52,044
and current events

1038
01:00:52,077 --> 01:00:56,081
instead of all that alien stuff.

1039
01:00:59,618 --> 01:01:01,220
You're not Sol.

1040
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:19,004
Oh my gosh.

1041
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:24,637
Hello?

1042
01:02:24,671 --> 01:02:25,471
Annie.

1043
01:02:25,504 --> 01:02:26,639
Annie.

1044
01:02:26,673 --> 01:02:28,173
It's Jared.

1045
01:02:28,207 --> 01:02:31,944
I remember,
I remember everything.

1046
01:02:31,977 --> 01:02:33,112
What happened?

1047
01:02:34,246 --> 01:02:36,382
Listen to me.

1048
01:02:36,415 --> 01:02:38,117
I'm locked in the back room
of my place.

1049
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:39,151
Why?

1050
01:02:39,184 --> 01:02:41,353
Why are you locked
in your bedroom?

1051
01:02:41,387 --> 01:02:43,389
Because there's men
in your apartment.

1052
01:02:46,091 --> 01:02:47,960
Just listen, Annie.

1053
01:02:47,993 --> 01:02:50,028
I don't have much time.

1054
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:52,164
I don't know who they are.

1055
01:02:52,197 --> 01:02:54,566
But I found out it has
something to do with the water.

1056
01:02:57,202 --> 01:02:58,705
And they have
the same bottled water

1057
01:02:58,738 --> 01:03:01,473
that's in the bottles of
water I've been drinking.

1058
01:03:13,585 --> 01:03:14,420
Annie?

1059
01:03:16,455 --> 01:03:18,490
Annie, are you still there?

1060
01:03:30,135 --> 01:03:31,236
I'm here.

1061
01:03:32,204 --> 01:03:34,741
I'm in one of the stations.

1062
01:03:34,774 --> 01:03:36,108
It's different.

1063
01:03:37,309 --> 01:03:39,311
You gotta get out of there.

1064
01:03:39,344 --> 01:03:41,648
You gotta get out of there
right now.

1065
01:03:41,681 --> 01:03:42,614
Did you hear me?

1066
01:03:42,649 --> 01:03:43,650
Okay.

1067
01:03:43,683 --> 01:03:45,652
What about those notes?

1068
01:03:45,685 --> 01:03:47,085
Listen,

1069
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,554
the numbers you gave me,

1070
01:03:48,587 --> 01:03:51,457
the numbers in your notes,
I think they're coordinates.

1071
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:53,158
It's...

1072
01:03:53,192 --> 01:03:54,026
30.44,

1073
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:56,028
33 degrees north

1074
01:03:57,329 --> 01:04:01,166
by 87.214 degrees west.

1075
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,134
I'm not sure what's going on

1076
01:04:02,167 --> 01:04:05,037
but those numbers hold
some kind of answer.

1077
01:04:13,245 --> 01:04:15,180
What're you doing here?

1078
01:04:16,348 --> 01:04:18,651
What do you want?

1079
01:04:18,685 --> 01:04:19,485
Jared!

1080
01:04:19,518 --> 01:04:20,519
- Oh no!
- Oh no.

1081
01:04:20,552 --> 01:04:21,153
No!

1082
01:04:21,186 --> 01:04:22,789
Jared, can you hear me?

1083
01:04:26,225 --> 01:04:27,559
Oh no.

1084
01:04:35,601 --> 01:04:36,669
Hello, Jared?

1085
01:04:36,703 --> 01:04:38,070
Jared, can you hear me?

1086
01:04:38,103 --> 01:04:39,371
Hello, Annie?

1087
01:04:39,404 --> 01:04:41,006
Is everything okay?

1088
01:04:42,742 --> 01:04:45,745
Annie?

1089
01:04:45,778 --> 01:04:49,181
Are you there, Annie?

1090
01:04:49,214 --> 01:04:50,650
Annie.

1091
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:48,473
Annie, wait a minute.

1092
01:05:54,246 --> 01:05:56,415
I just want to have
a word with you.

1093
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:31,784
Damn it.

1094
01:06:37,389 --> 01:06:38,223
Oh shit.

1095
01:06:41,226 --> 01:06:42,662
Open the door, Annie.

1096
01:06:42,695 --> 01:06:43,830
No!

1097
01:06:43,863 --> 01:06:44,831
No!

1098
01:06:44,864 --> 01:06:45,698
Please?

1099
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:49,234
Get away
from my car, James!

1100
01:06:50,569 --> 01:06:52,537
Don't you wanna be
one of us?

1101
01:06:57,644 --> 01:06:58,477
James.

1102
01:06:59,779 --> 01:07:01,814
Don't do this, please.

1103
01:07:01,848 --> 01:07:03,515
Don't do this to me, you
don't have to do this...

1104
01:07:03,548 --> 01:07:05,450
Open the door, Annie!

1105
01:07:05,484 --> 01:07:07,319
Open the door!

1106
01:07:07,352 --> 01:07:08,788
Open the door!

1107
01:07:08,821 --> 01:07:10,522
Annie.

1108
01:07:10,555 --> 01:07:11,691
Annie!

1109
01:07:12,591 --> 01:07:13,392
Open the door!

1110
01:07:13,425 --> 01:07:14,894
Annie.

1111
01:07:16,428 --> 01:07:17,262
Join us.

1112
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:19,932
Okay! Okay!

1113
01:07:22,401 --> 01:07:23,235
Okay.

1114
01:08:24,897 --> 01:08:25,998
The numbers.

1115
01:08:26,032 --> 01:08:27,399
Those numbers.

1116
01:09:15,648 --> 01:09:18,985
Make a right turn
in 200 feet.

1117
01:09:19,018 --> 01:09:20,119
This must be the place.

1118
01:09:20,153 --> 01:09:23,421
Your destination
is within half of a mile.

1119
01:10:55,748 --> 01:10:58,050
I shouldn't be here.

1120
01:11:19,005 --> 01:11:19,839
33.

1121
01:11:20,873 --> 01:11:21,908
97.

1122
01:11:23,242 --> 01:11:24,076
21.

1123
01:11:25,678 --> 01:11:26,511
14.

1124
01:11:27,579 --> 01:11:28,613
Three.

1125
01:11:28,881 --> 01:11:32,752
Your destination
is within 500 feet.

1126
01:11:32,952 --> 01:11:33,786
Four.

1127
01:11:34,687 --> 01:11:35,520
Three.

1128
01:11:36,255 --> 01:11:37,823
Three.

1129
01:11:40,126 --> 01:11:41,627
Seven.

1130
01:11:41,661 --> 01:11:42,494
Two.

1131
01:11:43,595 --> 01:11:44,429
One.

1132
01:11:45,131 --> 01:11:45,932
One.

1133
01:12:06,986 --> 01:12:07,820
25.

1134
01:12:09,789 --> 01:12:10,622
68.

1135
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:13,525
22.

1136
01:12:15,795 --> 01:12:16,629
34.

1137
01:12:17,863 --> 01:12:18,898
87.

1138
01:12:20,633 --> 01:12:21,466
68.

1139
01:12:24,569 --> 01:12:25,705
Where am I?

1140
01:12:27,173 --> 01:12:30,843
Your destination
is within 100 feet.

1141
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:55,593
You have arrived at your
destination.

1142
01:14:18,851 --> 01:14:19,852
Oh my God.

1143
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:31,831
This is it.

1144
01:14:33,666 --> 01:14:34,599
This is it.

1145
01:15:30,489 --> 01:15:32,758
This is Dr. John Fox Maner.

1146
01:15:34,326 --> 01:15:36,195
November 12th, I think.

1147
01:15:36,228 --> 01:15:37,029
It's...

1148
01:15:38,831 --> 01:15:41,066
It's a site that I woke up at.

1149
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:41,967
I don't know where I am.

1150
01:15:42,368 --> 01:15:44,470
I don't know where this is
but it's a remote location

1151
01:15:44,503 --> 01:15:46,338
that I know Arch is using.

1152
01:15:46,372 --> 01:15:48,240
This is not, this is not just
me.

1153
01:15:48,274 --> 01:15:51,343
People have been
disappearing every day.

1154
01:15:51,377 --> 01:15:53,345
I've seen it happening
around this facility.

1155
01:15:53,379 --> 01:15:56,015
There's people that disappear
and then they come back

1156
01:15:56,048 --> 01:15:57,750
and they're not
the same person.

1157
01:15:57,783 --> 01:15:59,885
I don't know where, I
don't know how I got here.

1158
01:15:59,919 --> 01:16:02,221
I'm trying to find answers
and I know they're here.

1159
01:16:02,254 --> 01:16:04,757
This form is
documents that I've seen,

1160
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:07,393
I've seen this work,
I've seen these notes.

1161
01:16:07,426 --> 01:16:08,260
I don't know
what they're trying to build

1162
01:16:08,294 --> 01:16:09,962
or what this is
supposed to replicate.

1163
01:16:09,995 --> 01:16:13,232
It's not anything that
has been done before.

1164
01:16:24,376 --> 01:16:25,311
What's that?!

1165
01:16:25,344 --> 01:16:26,378
God!

1166
01:16:27,546 --> 01:16:29,048
What is that?

1167
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:05,146
