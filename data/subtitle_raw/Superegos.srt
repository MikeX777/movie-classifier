1
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,162
<i>It's the Church of our Lady!
- Are you blind?</i>

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,405
<i>It's the cathedral.
- No, it's the Church of our Lady.</i>

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,568
<i>Two domes! Like tits!</i>

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,561
<i>Everybody knows it has two domes...</i>

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,684
<i>Why else would it be called
the Church of our Lady?</i>

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,970
<i>Nick? It's Jochen.</i>

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,282
<i>What's with the books?</i>

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,286
<i>I'm due two first editions.</i>

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,246
<i>You owe me 150 euros, too.</i>

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,125
<i>So come by.</i>

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,243
<i>Don't be shy.
Goodbye.</i>

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,325
<i>Nikita... it's me.
Call me, will you?</i>

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,322
<i>Don't you dare show up here. Ciao.</i>

14
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,124
<i>Hello Nick?
What's up?</i>

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,286
<i>Can I move back in?
Are you done painting?</i>

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,241
<i>Call me, will you?
It's really time you moved out! Bye.</i>

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,686
<i>Hi, Nick.
You're not returning calls again.</i>

18
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,487
<i>If you're hiding out
because you fucked up again,</i>

19
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,804
<i>we'll make you regret it.</i>

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,686
<i>Get me the money
or you'll be sorry. Bye.</i>

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,161
<i>Hey Nick, Lana here.</i>

22
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,890
<i>I got a tip, there's a villa
in Feldafing that's vacant.</i>

23
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,970
<i>You could hide out
there for a while.</i>

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,605
<i>But then we're even, okay?
Call me.</i>

25
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,327
<i>Bye.</i>

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,485
<i>We're going south...</i>

27
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,002
<i>What's that mountain range?</i>

28
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,284
<i>Yes, they're the Alps!</i>

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,003
SUPEREGOS

30
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,641
Hello.

31
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,522
Rosa Ledig.

32
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,766
Nick.

33
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,404
I thought it was Franz.

34
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,047
Nick-Franz.
Friends call me Nick.

35
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,409
Yes.
Good that you're here.

36
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,890
I'm in a hurry.
Come in.

37
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,120
Yes.

38
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,601
Where did you meet Uli?
She only said you were friends.

39
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,087
Yes, we share common...

40
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,201
experiences.

41
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,607
Experiences.
- Yes, encounters and so on.

42
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,168
So, I'll show you the room.

43
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,649
It's delicate trusting someone
with your parents' house.

44
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,366
Absolutely.

45
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,207
I thought you'd be more conventional.

46
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,971
Anyway, I'm glad you're here
to look after the house.

47
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,127
Right... yes...
what else was there?

48
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,370
The sightseeing tour.
Come along.

49
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,521
The bathroom...

50
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,126
The subconscious
sends a signal to act.

51
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,800
This is sometimes
incorrectly executed,

52
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,085
and then, in retrospect,
our detective,

53
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,806
the consciousness,

54
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,089
defines this as our intention.

55
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,566
Stimulus... effect.

56
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,528
We're preparing a short film about you.

57
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,204
We want to feature your lecture
at the symposium.

58
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,926
Hence the next question:
will you speak

59
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,204
about the theory you just described,
or about other things?

60
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,363
I think I'll have to pursue...

61
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,565
a completely different... personal issue:

62
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,810
Oh, yes?
- I refer to the era of the Third Reich.

63
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,287
In this context,
Charles Steinbach once said

64
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,162
"Curt Ledig is one of the 20th century's
key psychologists and thinkers.

65
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,723
But unfortunately... he was a Nazi."
- How flattering.

66
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,806
Flattering?

67
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,886
Well, my writings
have indeed been influential...

68
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,566
but one of the most important
of the 20th century?

69
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,964
Who can say that?

70
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,682
But his accusations...
- Which?

71
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,405
That you were a Nazi.

72
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,728
Oh, yes, that...

73
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,441
Is the light bothering you?
- No.

74
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,808
Back then, as a young man,
your academic career...

75
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,527
was partly due to Goebbels' approval
of your early texts.

76
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,085
No, that is...

77
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,201
most complicated.
- Oops!

78
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,769
That was me. Sorry.

79
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,530
Time's up.
We have to go.

80
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,243
Can't we do another ten minutes?
- No, we've got to go.

81
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,205
Goodbye. Goodbye.

82
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,689
When is it being broadcasted?
- We don't know yet.

83
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,723
We'll let you know.
- Great.

84
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,809
By email or telephone?

85
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,525
Hello.

86
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,967
Papa, could you come here, please?

87
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,769
You know, I've changed my mind.

88
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,449
It's not a good idea, after all.

89
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,008
What?
- To leave the house now.

90
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,251
There's too much to do.

91
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,769
But you can work at our house.
- No, my office is here.

92
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,849
And all my things. I...

93
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,480
I have to...

94
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,245
prepare it here.

95
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,886
You could do that just as well at ours.
- No.

96
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,730
Come on, Papa. Don't be difficult.

97
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,251
What about Franz-Nick?
- Oh, he's no trouble.

98
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,886
Can you drive?

99
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,607
A manual, yes.

100
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,047
Manual?

101
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,046
It's decided.

102
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,042
<i>You know what, Papa?
You're exhausting.</i>

103
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,411
<i>No really!</i>

104
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,521
Stubborn as an ox.

105
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,723
That's just what I wanted to avoid.

106
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,649
My kids are waiting.
What shall I do with you both?

107
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,164
Can you even take care of him?

108
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,966
One condition:
danger money.

109
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,604
For you or for my father?

110
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,370
How do I know
you'll take good care of him?

111
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,971
Feminine intuition?

112
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,368
A little bit of respect and my father
is easy to handle. Get me?

113
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,730
He can do most things alone.
But you have to shop.

114
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,446
And he never cooks.
He has this kitchen-phobia.

115
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,529
This is all just temporary, of course.

116
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,644
Hello?
- Wait a moment, please.

117
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,207
Did you pay for the taxi, buddy?

118
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,606
Er, yes.
- Good.

119
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,764
We have something to discuss.

120
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,931
I just wanted...
- This really isn't the time.

121
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,205
You can go on to the house.

122
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,685
I'll be right there.

123
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,047
Good?

124
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,649
He'd better not be staying.
- He's just bringing my things.

125
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,242
Take good care, Franz-Nick.
- Don't you worry, now.

126
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,364
He'll be right there,
you can leave the meter running.

127
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,766
Franz...

128
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,210
unfortunately...
the situation has changed.

129
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,569
The old man is dead.

130
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,167
Oh!

131
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,644
I'm so sorry.
- Yes...

132
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,685
Very sad.

133
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,804
I'm here to tidy up his affairs.

134
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,371
But...

135
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,724
thanks for coming.

136
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,644
No really, thank you.

137
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,404
Too bad
you had to come all this way

138
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,966
for nothing.

139
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,045
Well then, goodbye.

140
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,451
Thanks again.

141
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,489
Give me that.
- Yes, thank you... Oh, boy.

142
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,043
What?
- Oh, nothing.

143
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,051
Shut that door!

144
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,285
"Concentration"?

145
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,807
You hit the nail on its sensitive head.

146
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,087
At the symposium I'll speak

147
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,728
about the darkest chapter
in my life.

148
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,121
It's...

149
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,885
just not that simple.

150
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,570
How do you make a living?
- Doing business.

151
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,604
Business.
- You have one?

152
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,606
Not exactly. I buy books
for two euros and sell them for ten.

153
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,290
I'm beginning to understand.

154
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,251
You love old books.

155
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,126
I took an interest
in old things once.

156
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,240
Now they are more like
a second skin to me.

157
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,927
Keep grubby mitts
off ancient lit!

158
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,440
One moment.

159
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,050
We have much to do.

160
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,327
Wednesdays at 11.

161
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,447
I get a massage.

162
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,971
Thursdays... Thursdays...
I visit my friend Hélène.

163
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,967
You'll have the opportunity to meet her.

164
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,009
Thursday?
- Huh? Yes.

165
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,684
Thursday is bad.

166
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,561
We'll manage.

167
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:05,889
'Night.

168
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,165
Well, I don't know.

169
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,682
Krazy Kat would be interesting,

170
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,087
but given the condition...

171
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,561
Nope, no.

172
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,331
The Plato is expensive
but it's worth it.

173
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,844
It's that great translation
by this humanist Agricola.

174
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,806
The Ferrari of Plato translations.

175
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,442
I'll stick with Atomic Eye.

176
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,326
It's more my thing.

177
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,522
But then we're even.
It wasn't exactly cheap.

178
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,528
Even?
Little shitter!

179
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,605
You're dreaming, son.

180
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,202
That hardly covers my costs.

181
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,487
Now you get a provisional fix

182
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,367
till you can deliver.

183
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,962
Let's hope it holds till then.

184
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,491
You're a bloody thief!

185
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,567
My comics will be buying your kids
a hybrid Hummer.

186
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,366
A what?
- A hybrid Hummer...

187
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,322
you bastard.
- See what I have to deal with?

188
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,810
I'm too kind, too benevolent...
let myself be exploited.

189
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,611
Open up, now.

190
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,243
There.
Wonderful.

191
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,960
So, now fingers here.

192
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,611
Good.
Now we wait till the mass hardens.

193
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,811
Then I'll be back.

194
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,771
We'll be right back.

195
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,925
Everything fine here?
- Yes.

196
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,246
Great.

197
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,371
One moment,
the mass just has to harden.

198
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,604
Gutlicht, you dog!

199
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,331
Oh shit!

200
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,044
Come out, you prick!

201
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,040
Bastard!

202
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,725
Wonderful.

203
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,364
<i>Lacan... get lost!</i>

204
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,960
You beast!

205
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,166
What time is it?
- It's after six already.

206
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,727
So late?
- Do you also make breakfast?

207
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,201
Can't you do that yourself?

208
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,164
No, the kitchen was my wife's domain.

209
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,727
lam excluded.
- Good excuse.

210
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,483
Three sugars and black, thanks.

211
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,405
Are you incapable or unwilling?

212
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,761
Of what?

213
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,404
Of entering the kitchen.
- Yes.

214
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,807
I'm prepared to go and get the paper.

215
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,009
What's your name?

216
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,206
Nick.

217
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,040
Fine, Nick...

218
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,730
<i>The first foot.</i>

219
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,251
<i>Are you love sick?</i>

220
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,761
<i>Why, Professor?</i>

221
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,011
<i>You smell of oleander.</i>

222
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,921
<i>Lilac flowers.</i>

223
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,171
<i>The passion killer among the flowers!</i>

224
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,008
<i>It's not perfume, it's the massage oil.</i>

225
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,526
Interesting...

226
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,323
You're the worst crossbreed
between a sewer rat and a book worm!

227
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,010
Thanks, sweet of you.

228
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,325
I have something for you.

229
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,928
Hey!
- That's where you belong.

230
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,085
What do you take me for?

231
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,326
A first edition of sentimental value;
spine broken, condition poor.

232
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,761
A mercy killing is what I'd recommend.

233
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,764
500... and the blouse.

234
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,205
Forget it.

235
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,489
Less than 3000 is a joke.
All right...

236
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,245
2900, the blouse and skirt.

237
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,044
750,

238
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,526
the blouse, the skirt,

239
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,881
and the boots.

240
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,169
2800
and I get the panties, too.

241
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,483
Now strip
or I'll strangle you!

242
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,051
Entry one:

243
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,681
A new file on the man
living here with me.

244
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,091
Name and date...

245
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,407
unknown.

246
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,531
Where he's from is also unknown.

247
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,091
Too bad.

248
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,371
He's taken a work from my library.

249
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,722
Which precisely, I don't know,

250
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,004
but with the obvious intention

251
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,249
of concealing this from me.

252
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,522
Observations in his room...

253
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,483
<i>Incredibly ugly.</i>

254
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,290
<i>Modern architecture?
- Yes, it's a villa.</i>

255
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,245
<i>It's a town house in the country. Vile!</i>

256
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,369
<i>It's functional, it's really pretty.</i>

257
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,211
<i>Functional!
It must be from the GDR.</i>

258
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,610
<i>Typical GDR.</i>

259
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,170
<i>This here was the GDR?
- In the style of the GDR.</i>

260
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,888
<i>It's obvious. They built it that way.
Without any taste.</i>

261
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,564
<i>I want to take a photo.</i>

262
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,366
<i>Andreas, be quiet. I have to concentrate!</i>

263
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,409
Are you leaving the house today?
- I have to go into town.

264
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,361
You can take my car.
- Thanks.

265
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,325
Good.

266
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,723
I have to go into town, anyway.

267
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,205
But I'll be there all day.
- Excellent.

268
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,242
Sorry, I can't take you with me.

269
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,610
Then leave the car here.

270
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,403
Don't turn left here, drive straight on.

271
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,370
Watch the oncoming traffic.

272
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,167
It's heavy and fast because
they're coming from the highway.

273
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,849
So, then up there...

274
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,768
turn in right at the grey gate.

275
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,805
Well, I've got to go.

276
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,768
You can take a taxi home.

277
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,325
Will you give me the car keys?

278
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,691
We won't stay long.

279
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,931
If you please...

280
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,526
Thank you.

281
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,251
Hélène always has pretty companions.

282
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,522
I've known Ms. Tischmann
very long, let me tell you.

283
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,803
I think she's my oldest
living colleague and friend...

284
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,211
This is...

285
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,890
Hello, hello.
- Nick.

286
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,286
Have you had breakfast?

287
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,611
Careful.

288
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,521
Nick?

289
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,441
Nick, just dive in if you want.

290
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,889
I swim a few lengths every day.

291
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,530
I don't have trunks with me.

292
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,681
That doesn't...
-... matter.

293
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,163
Towels are over there.

294
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,968
Is this your... chaperon?

295
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,042
They hired him for me.
He's a not-uninteresting man.

296
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,649
A friendly drifter,
unruly, angry... full of passion.

297
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,526
Are you practicing again?
- No, no, no!

298
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,609
Under no circumstances.

299
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,962
She's not totally unerotic.

300
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,290
Neither of them are.
- No.

301
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,407
Look,
they're swimming together...

302
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,728
Are you French?
- Alsatian.

303
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,606
Alsatian...

304
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,129
An Alsatian
who won't enter the kitchen!

305
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,686
That's rare.

306
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,808
You'll have to tell me your name again.

307
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,806
Nick.
- Nick, Nick, Nick.

308
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,685
And where are you from?

309
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,810
The industrial zone.

310
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,766
From the Ruhr Area?

311
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,090
You don't like to talk about it.

312
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,565
I grew up in Linz.
The working man's part.

313
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,205
My mother was a cook.

314
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,611
Grew up in humble conditions,

315
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,610
father unknown,

316
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,320
mother a cook.

317
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,530
Shamefully anal,

318
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,610
latent Oedipal.

319
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,327
You feeling okay?
- Yes, yes.

320
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,605
Where should I drop you off?

321
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,525
Just keep driving.

322
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,691
<i>Culture bulletin!</i>

323
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,283
<i>“Psychology in Transition“,
is the title of an Academy Symposium</i>

324
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,720
<i>being held in two weeks.</i>

325
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:53,086
<i>We particularly look forward to seeing

326
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,328
<i>who is to be the guest of honor.</i>

327
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,003
<i>Ledig's work on crowd psychology

<i>He will speak on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
with culture historian Bernd Wälzer.</i>

329
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,203
How did you get this fine piece?
- Divine providence.

330
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,490
1060, it's all I have.

331
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,681
You get the rest when I've sold it, okay?

332
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,725
In a hurry, sweetie?

333
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,528
No romance without finance.

334
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,131
Shithead.

335
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,406
Wait here.

336
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,924
He divided up the money

337
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,322
and took only some of it with him.

338
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,805
There may be method to this.

339
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,609
He has been badly beaten

340
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,450
and looks in bad shape.

341
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,240
Get out!

342
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,044
What?
- Out! -Okay, okay!

343
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,049
Who is that?
- René.

344
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,170
He did this to you?
- Yes.

345
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,289
I owed Mother money.

346
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,281
Whom? Speak clearly.
- His boss.

347
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,051
I owed his boss money.
- Your mother?

348
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,688
She's not my mother.
- No?

349
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,123
No.
- Well?

350
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,321
She wanted more money.

351
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,561
So you gave her my car.

352
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,562
I wouldn't say I gave it to her.

353
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,364
She just took it!

354
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,444
Now how do you like that!

355
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,248
Professor, don't!

356
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,882
Prof...

357
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,530
Then get some help, use your head.

358
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,681
Yes, sure.

359
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,047
No, no way... Wait...

360
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,841
Well?
- A young man was just here.

361
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,486
He returned in a very bad condition.

362
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,689
And then my car was...

363
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,567
confiscated,
or rather, stolen.

364
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,327
Apparently on the orders of a lady...

365
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,366
known as Mother.
- You must be mistaken.

366
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,250
Hold on, I'll call you back.

367
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,208
Are you Mother?
- What is it you want?

368
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,370
I want my car back.

369
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,123
You have the keys.
- It was your car?

370
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,006
Bad luck.

371
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,807
Mother...

372
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,404
You hit people,
and they call you Mother.

373
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,011
Very interesting.

374
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,171
Sad.

375
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,091
Give me the keys, please.

376
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,448
You want a car?
Buy one.

377
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,210
An Astra...
Let's see... 2500 euros?

378
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,806
I won't pay for my own car.
- Now listen here...

379
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,408
your friend owes me over 15000.

380
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,883
And you're making a fuss
about an old Astra?

381
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,642
It's just a down-payment.
And the rest is due soon.

382
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,325
Tell that to your protégé.

383
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,042
Are you...
Now I'm mad.

384
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,522
René!

385
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,565
Let him have it!

386
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,641
Who let the old idiot in, anyway?

387
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,207
I shouldn't have let you go in there.

388
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,205
But you still have money.

389
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,645
Why didn't you pay more?

390
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,127
And what would I live from, then?

391
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,770
That's not how you do business.

392
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,568
I miscalculated slightly,

393
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,287
but you never completely pay back
these people or you're lost.

394
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,291
Where'd you get that idea from?

395
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,651
It's best not to borrow
in the first place.

396
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,091
And I don't like going to Mother
and getting beaten up.

397
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,770
You can believe me.

398
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,808
These are obviously repetitive patterns.

399
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,209
Cyclical, so to speak.

400
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,409
Now...
I'll play the role of the father.

401
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,123
Oh no... Papa!

402
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,366
Associate freely: spinning top.

403
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,131
No.
- Yes! Go.

404
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,481
Spinning top.
- Please spare me your psycho crap.

405
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,809
Try to visualize.

406
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,049
Enter into a dialogue.

407
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,889
I'll start again... spinning top.

408
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,686
No.
- Yes.

409
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,484
No!
- Go. Spinning top.

410
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,929
Will you stop with that shit!

411
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,124
Try to visualize...

412
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,766
I'll start again.

413
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,211
Spinning top.

414
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,125
Pain in the ass.

415
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,240
Backyard.

416
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,966
Blood-sucker.

417
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,242
Mother.

418
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,044
Cold dog.

419
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,571
Father.

420
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,885
Blue Danube.

421
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,883
Wavy locks.
- No, no, no!

422
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,128
Don't evade. Everything is fine.

423
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,921
Continue. You...

424
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,645
...nited states.
- The States.

425
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,690
Counties.
- Counties.

426
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,206
Communities.

427
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,131
Love.

428
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,766
Love.
- Shut up!

429
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,041
Easy now...

430
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,360
Imagine...

431
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,122
that you are a small tree

432
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,964
planted in stony soil.

433
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,764
I have to get out.

434
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,570
They broke my ribs.

435
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,281
Listen to me, stay with the image.

436
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,765
You are the tree.

437
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,721
Now someone builds a wall around you,

438
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,645
that shelters you from the wind

439
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,966
and protects the soil.

440
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,885
Stay with the image.

441
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,966
You develop...

442
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,124
and grow strong and tall.

443
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,290
Suddenly this wall
that has always protected you

444
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,883
becomes a corset
that makes breathing difficult.

445
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,531
Feel it.

446
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,004
You will try to break through that wall,

447
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,248
but if you fail...
you will stay where you are.

448
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,571
That's tough.

449
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,122
Just let it happen.

450
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,685
You made great progress.

451
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,925
You will notice it.

452
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,847
Hello.

453
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,963
There you are.
- Hello Fafa.

454
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,807
How unexpected.
- Well...

455
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,481
Hello.

456
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,165
Mr. Franz-Nick, right?

457
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,407
Fanny.

458
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,365
We haven't met,
but my sister told me about you.

459
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,130
I wasn't expecting you all.

460
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,482
We just got back
from San Francisco today,

461
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,763
and decided to visit you first
before going to the cabin.

462
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,249
Karina and the kids are here,
they're joining us for a few days.

463
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,851
But what happened to you?

464
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,603
Oh, it's a long story.

465
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,011
Well, come on in, then.

466
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,490
Look who's here.

467
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,880
Curt, hi, hey.

468
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,083
There he is... Morle!

469
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,404
How are you?
- I'm well.

470
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,443
Yes?
- Hello, Grandfather.

471
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,961
You, too.

472
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,322
Hello Curt.
- Hello, how are you?

473
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,410
Well, thanks.
- You're sweating.

474
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,969
Well, I think Curt looks frightful.

475
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,090
The house stinks,
that guy smoked everywhere.

476
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,725
We were in the garage,

477
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,491
the side window
is completely non-existent.

478
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,843
The car window is broken, Mama,
and shards are everywhere.

479
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,049
Won't you have something to eat?

480
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,527
Uh-huh.

481
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,041
Gladly.

482
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,645
Please...

483
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,361
Excuse me...

484
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,725
Thank you.

485
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,290
So what happened to you?

486
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,242
I had to pay money back.

487
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,162
And injured yourself doing so.
And my father?

488
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,884
He waited outside.

489
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,444
And got injured there? No!

490
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,047
No, sadly he got angry and decided
to speak to those people.

491
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,851
And then?

492
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,561
Then they got a little rough.

493
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,882
Just a little.

494
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,970
What?

495
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,290
Yes, he was really lucky.

496
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,324
It's not funny.

497
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,451
And you dare just tell us this?

498
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,084
This is entirely unacceptable.

499
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,567
I see what my father sees in you,

500
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,566
you're a not-uninteresting case,
but tomorrow we're taking father...

501
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,526
with us and will no longer need you.

502
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,524
May I leave the kitchen to you?
- Sure...

503
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,131
No problem.

504
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,891
He's gone.

505
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,447
Is anything missing?

506
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,250
I feel awful...

507
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,121
I...

508
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,724
I can't.
- Why not?

509
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,571
I can't go in there.
- You can't enter the kitchen?

510
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,762
No...

511
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,166
I don't know what's going on...

512
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,642
I had the weirdest dreams...

513
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,403
I was the old guy

514
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,688
and felt so horrible.

515
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,851
What old guy?

516
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,885
No... the... the...

517
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,970
Curt Ledig,
the guy I was living with.

518
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,163
The psychologist Curt Ledig?

519
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,405
You didn't mention that.

520
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,251
I can go into the other rooms...

521
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,083
All the others are okay...

522
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,011
But...

523
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,290
not this one.

524
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,841
Should I carry you over the threshold,
sweetie?

525
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,210
Let's give it a try.

526
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,401
Nick?

527
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,366
Am I in the bathroom or the kitchen?

528
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,288
Should I really tell you?
- No.

529
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,886
No...

530
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,326
That's great!

531
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,051
Help me!

532
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,369
You could start out smaller.

533
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,451
Try the <i>Studiosa Model.</i>

534
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,965
Studiosa?

535
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,605
The fucking Nazi!

536
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:58,168
What about Goebbels?
- Goebbels had my essay printed.

537
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,241
Yes.

538
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,124
Are they good?
- No.

539
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,890
That pleased me, back then, as a student.

540
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,045
That's true, yes.

541
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,921
It got me the teaching post
in Freiburg.

542
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,851
Isn't that right?
- Yes, that's how it was.

543
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,131
Sartre was right.

544
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,204
I'm nauseating.

545
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,488
Sartre never said you're nauseating.

546
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,968
Don't always contradict, Stephanie.
- I don't always contradict.

547
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,763
You've done it again.
Nauseating!

548
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,365
Do you know what Dr. Schwarz said
last time we saw him?

549
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,005
No, and I don't want to.

550
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,521
Well, he said you need our support

551
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,331
and shouldn't live alone anymore.
That's what he said.

552
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,681
Who said that?

553
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,605
Your family doctor.

554
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,848
This intermezzo with that Nick-Franz...

555
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,441
showed that this won't work.

556
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,041
We're not going back to Feldafing.

557
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,123
You'll live with Rosa now.
- That's enough, Stephanie!

558
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,485
<i>Oh, mother mine!</i>

559
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,646
<i>The raving idiot!</i>

560
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,049
<i>Whom did he call thus?</i>

561
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,487
"The Prince of Homburg,
clutching at the wreath."

562
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,162
<i>Beloved, why do you recoil?</i>

563
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,846
<i>My Natalie!</i>

564
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,329
"He snatches a glove
from the Princess' hand."

565
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,529
<i>Heaven and earth!
What laid he hands on there?</i>

566
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,007
<i>The wreath?</i>

567
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,211
Nick?
- You can't throw him out.

568
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,167
He'll be gone
before you can say "Kuala Lumpur".

569
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:45,081
Right, that's the worst thing...
you can't even throw him out.

570
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,841
I think we'll do it on Friday.
Saturday's okay, too...

571
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,567
Sometime...

572
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,650
Not for sale, not for sale, not for sale!

573
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,606
But they have price tags.
- Out. This is not a telephone booth!

574
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,761
Hello?

575
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,484
Yes.
<i>- Listen, I was about to buy some books...</i>

576
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,365
Why from the dentist's?

577
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,767
No!

578
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,487
No!

579
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,326
No, I can't come.

580
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,963
What?
- She won't come.

581
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,329
Mrs. Proehl is ready in room one.

582
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,925
The waiting room is packed.

583
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,168
Oh, crap. I'll be right there.

584
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,129
He is me, the old guy.

585
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,289
But only partially.

586
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,602
The kitchen-thing, for example...

587
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,130
and the eye...

588
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,482
and anyway,
it's this general feeling...

589
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,650
How many sugars does he take?
- Very funny.

590
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,090
It's creepy...

591
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,847
and really sucks.
- Utterly, yes.

592
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,004
I'm busy, get to the point.

593
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,890
Are you nuts? There's no smoking here.
Give me that.

594
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,520
If you want to catch a tiger,
you have to enter its cave.

595
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,530
Mr. Sochurek, are you coming?
- Yes, I am.

596
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,886
<i>Nick Gutlicht here. I'm not available.
- Hello, Mr. Nick?</i>

597
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,767
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

598
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,286
You're not there.

599
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,883
My situation is not good.

600
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,487
I cannot work here.

601
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:07,522
Please come here at once and pick...

602
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,765
get me out of here!

603
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,766
Tyrol,

604
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,163
August 23...

605
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,201
Cordially...

606
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,481
Ledig.

607
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,841
He's there!
- How did you find him?

608
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,610
I saw him from up there.

609
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,840
Grandfather...

610
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,365
Oh God! Grandfather!

611
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,891
He's freezing cold.

612
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,567
Anne, run quickly to Fanny.

613
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,644
Tell her to run a hot bath.

614
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,729
Fanny!
- And tell the others...

615
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,166
to come and help.

616
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,849
"The questions that torment me
will soon make me perfect...

617
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,091
...ly insane."

618
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,328
Oh!
"I must set this right."

619
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,682
What must you set right?
- Not me.

620
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,842
Curt.

621
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,202
What must you set right, Grandfather?

622
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,209
"I want to set right my motives,

623
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,571
I don't know
how much time I have left.

624
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,967
"Matsutake Titiku..."
Sorry, I can't read this...

625
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:39,242
"says:

626
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,367
'The morning... glory blooms
but an hour...

627
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,689
and yet it differs not at heart

628
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,601
from the... giant pine that lives
for a thousand years."'

629
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,804
"I'm cold, I want to get out."

630
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,846
Mu Tsi?

631
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,969
Look.
- What?

632
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,371
I've never seen him before.
- Nor have I.

633
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,567
Can you drive?

634
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,248
What do you think, can he cure me?

635
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,490
I think
you triggered something together...

636
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,808
and now you want to see it through.

637
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,925
I don't know...

638
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:09,885
It's always good if a therapeutic
process is not abruptly interrupted.

639
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,530
It'll definitely be interesting.

640
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,362
He hasn't practiced therapy in 50 years.

641
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,321
You!

642
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,251
Is that your car?

643
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,206
Hey kid...

644
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,042
What's the magic word?
- Thanks.

645
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,131
Nice tic!

646
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,043
That was your Nazi voodoo.

647
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,124
What?
Nazi what?

648
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:10,325
Your blitz therapy.
Remember? I'm your victim!

649
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,363
You look interesting.

650
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,690
I didn't recognize you at all.

651
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,930
I'm glad you're here.

652
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,884
We'll see about that.

653
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,727
<i>Come home at once.</i>

654
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,171
Yes, yes, yes.

655
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,886
Fanny!

656
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,562
Now let me work in peace, please.

657
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,401
Thanks.

658
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,481
Yes... See you soon.

659
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,286
Bye-bye.

660
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,807
They're coming.
All of them, I think.

661
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:11,562
Mama, Papa,
being silent is unhealthy!

662
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,771
You made me go gaga,
now make me normal again.

663
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,890
Is gaga a synonym
for the existential crisis

664
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,445
of a small-time crook?

665
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,530
No, this is gaga.

666
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,481
I can't go in the kitchen, either.

667
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,889
I feel like shit.

668
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,728
And... It's you who's the crook...

669
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,287
And I want to know
how you're going to fix me up now.

670
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,331
What did I do to you?
- Don't you remember?

671
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,324
All that shit with...

672
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,524
USA, county, community...
the association crap.

673
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:13,411
I never imagined
you'd react to it so well.

674
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,449
And you want to continue? Excellent.

675
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,884
How do we continue?
- I absolutely must prepare my lecture.

676
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,125
You'll never manage a lecture,
you wreck!

677
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,971
So forget it.
And either we start now,

678
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,811
or I'm taking you back
to your family at once.

679
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,890
Coffee would be nice.
- It'd be nice, yes.

680
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,723
I thought you couldn't go in the kitchen.

681
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,447
No, no!

682
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,481
You can keep that symptom for yourself.

683
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,040
This therapy, how long does it last?

684
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,689
Two years, two months...

685
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,771
that depends on you.

686
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,446
That's too long.

687
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:05,363
Then I'll have to invent
a blitz therapy.

688
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,803
But then you'll help me get in shape.

689
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,206
Bernie?

690
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,490
Bernie?
- I am here.

691
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,531
You won't believe the stuff
they've got lying around.

692
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,804
There's a complete
Encyclopaedia Britannica.

693
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,126
Yeah, I know.

694
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,007
Hello?

695
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,440
Curt?

696
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,401
Curt?

697
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,362
Hello...

698
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,367
Jasper...
- Is anything missing?

699
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,240
Police? There's been a break-in
and we caught them red-handed.

700
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,090
No, they're escaping right now.

701
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,843
No idea.
- I'm at 10, Bergstrasse,

702
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,965
in Curt Ledig's house.

703
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,931
Someone might still be there.
Don't go too far.

704
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,730
<i>Don't all go away.</i>

705
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,365
We'll wait.
<i>- Mama!</i>

706
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,369
<i>They should come!</i>
- Are you coming?

707
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:47,283
No, we'll wait, but are you coming?
<i>- Come here. I'm all alone here.</i>

708
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,808
<i>Mama!</i>
- God, this is terrible.

709
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,524
Mama asked me where I had it from,

710
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,769
I told her I'd stolen it
and she slapped me.

711
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:02,291
She did what?
- Gave me a slap.

712
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,930
I had to take the chewing gum
back to the shop and say sorry,

713
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,168
even though
it was already in my mouth.

714
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,600
Pretty unpleasant.

715
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,920
And at the time
I didn't feel guilty at all.

716
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,521
Oh yes, guilt, guilt!

717
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,885
Egomaniacal
and with no conscience!

718
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,002
You think?
- Well...

719
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,281
Why?

720
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:29,321
I could have avoided that guilt.

721
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,765
We're talking about me.
- Yes, yes...

722
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,090
Let's speak about you.

723
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,120
Do you think... that I...

724
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,005
that I'm guilty?

725
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,131
Fitness is essential.

726
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,846
This will freshen you up.

727
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,121
Shit!

728
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,122
Well?

729
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,127
Where was the elephant,
little scoundrel?

730
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,405
Well, where's the elephant?

731
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,202
Ah.

732
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,845
And there's the other one!

733
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,329
You have the upper hand again.

734
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,362
Well...

735
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,723
Whale!
- Where was the whale?

736
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:56,685
I've become a stranger in my own past.

737
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,771
Deeper.

738
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,845
Easy for you to say.

739
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,363
Feel the weight of the shovel.

740
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,643
Accept it.

741
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,442
So.

742
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,207
These new sticks are really fantastic.

743
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,251
Where was I...
where was I?

744
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,521
Regardless...

745
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,651
You will see,
it's a successful transference.

746
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,201
You are developing.

747
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,409
We're digging towards the core.

748
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,690
What do you mean, "We"?

749
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,005
Hey, careful!

750
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,044
This is an established ascetic method...

751
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:08,802
as far as I know...
Since Claude Lévi-Strauss...

752
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,730
Like shamans
walking over hot coals. Only different.

753
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:18,130
Your symptoms will flee...

754
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,970
like birds from a scarecrow.

755
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,331
It might get hot.

756
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,402
Would you put your hat on my head?

757
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,361
Twenty minutes,
then you get me out of here.

758
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:40,451
Get me?

759
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:43,806
Twenty minutes!

760
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,161
I remember now, Nick.
You stole from me.

761
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,403
On first-name terms now, are we?

762
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:13,605
Don't be evasive now!

763
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:16,646
You stole from me.

764
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,811
Because
that's also your mode of dialogue.

765
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,691
I see it as a compliment.

766
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,046
Talk to...

767
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,491
the dead ant.

768
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,364
Dialogue bullshitter!

769
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,771
You're not ready yet.

770
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,610
We agreed on twenty minutes.

771
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,325
I want to get out now.

772
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:37,761
I need a pee.

773
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:28,525
You Nazi!

774
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,768
You Nazi bastard!

775
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,801
Shut your mouth!

776
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:41,251
You haven't a clue.

777
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:45,885
You old Nazi fag!
- Rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb.

778
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,448
Let me be!

779
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,611
You bastard!

780
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,371
Piss off.

781
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,961
Curt?

782
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,881
Curt, more light!

783
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,411
More light!

784
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,448
Curt!
More light!

785
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:51,401
Curt, more light!

786
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,284
What's wrong with you?

787
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:51,727
Why...

788
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:54,165
Why are you in the ground?

789
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,245
That's a good question.

790
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,044
You wanted to dig me out...

791
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,726
because
there was no point to this anymore.

792
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,366
Yes...

793
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,049
It's all pointless.
- No.

794
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,765
No, no, er...

795
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,091
Everything's fine.

796
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,806
It all went fine,

797
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,050
and digging me out now would be
the crowning glory, so to speak.

798
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,761
Don't you think, huh?

799
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:30,927
Curt?

800
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,406
I can't take any more... you sadist.

801
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:57,884
I can't take it anymore.

802
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:03,411
I can't feel my arms or legs anymore,

803
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,051
I can't breathe...

804
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:08,649
I don't want to die here.

805
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,608
Curt, hey, Curt!

806
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:30,049
<i>I've started doing
my Far Eastern exercises again.</i>

807
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,570
<i>I sometimes feel
I should take patients again.</i>

808
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:38,161
<i>The conclusion of this experiment
remains unclear.</i>

809
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,841
<i>I can see clearly and remember more.</i>

810
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,167
<i>Perhaps the fresh air
is doing me good.</i>

811
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,326
<i>The young man
is doing well in his hole.</i>

812
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,246
<i>Dr. Schwarz would be pleased with me.</i>

813
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,725
I can go into the kitchen!

814
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,604
I'm through.

815
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:17,120
I will have to cancel
the symposium.

816
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,130
Then I'll bring you home.

817
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,370
The children were right.

818
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,171
I'm old.

819
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,481
Straight ahead.

820
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,522
Then left to the parking lot.

821
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:05,044
You've made a step forwards
but you're not cured yet.

822
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,162
So, if you need me...

823
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,810
you know where to find me.

824
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:14,561
Yes.

825
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,201
Awful.

826
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,164
Don't let them get you down.

827
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:27,051
Take it easy.

828
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,729
Grandpa,
what are you doing in there?

829
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:57,730
Are you looking for something
in particular?

830
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,327
Yup.

831
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,769
Yes?
- I'm looking for Nick.

832
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:06,807
"Little Nicholas"? With the kids' books.
- No, our mutual friend.

833
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,167
Mother?
- That's why I'm here.

834
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:16,244
I can no longer stand to see Nick
suffer under the burden of his debts.

835
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:21,483
I've no idea what you're talking about.
- Give him my regards.

836
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,441
I'll be back in a week. One week.

837
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:27,526
Feedback is payback.
Get it?

838
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:30,642
Well...

839
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,569
This can't be the end.

840
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,769
Ladies and gentlemen...

841
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,926
I attempted to lead people astray...

842
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:53,005
and by so doing,
was misled myself.

843
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,162
There are...

844
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,050
areas of guilt...

845
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,650
Hello, how are you?

846
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,684
I was worried about you.

847
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:37,650
I woke up and suddenly
could see it all before me.

848
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:41,082
Now I know what must be said.

849
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,006
What are you doing?

850
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,771
Continuing our dialogue.

851
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,841
I still have a problem to resolve.

852
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,646
How bold!
My finest volumes.

853
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,248
For this you will bring me
to the symposium.

854
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,242
Curt?

855
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,286
Everything okay?
- Yes.

856
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:13,205
Hurry!
- Not so fast!

857
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:20,486
And at the end of the street
there's a manor.

858
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:22,490
That's where the symposium
is being held.

859
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,291
In the Liverpool Room.

860
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:25,925
Have you made a note of that?

861
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:27,840
<i>Trousers!</i>

862
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:29,646
One moment...

863
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,760
Yes?

864
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,970
<i>Propaganda, Papageno. . .</i>
- Not a castle, a manor.

865
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,600
A manor house.

866
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:47,127
And I have the goods, tell Mother that.

867
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:48,446
<i>Jacket!</i>

868
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,240
René...
I'll be in the eleventh row.

869
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,526
All right?

870
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,246
Yes. Bye.

871
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:03,924
Brown is just not my color.

872
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:05,406
This is better.

873
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:14,600
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me
in welcoming Professor Dr. Curt Ledig.

874
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,570
He holds the Charlemagne Prize,

875
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,047
belongs to the German Order of Merit...

876
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:34,964
and his honorary doctorates
are too numerous for me to list.

877
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,006
Professor Dr. Ledig,

878
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,931
you are here today because you've wished

879
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,361
to speak once more
about your own biography.

880
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:46,002
Both the specialist public and I myself

881
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:50,410
eagerly await insight
into your fascinating and varied life.

882
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:54,245
For me, this opportunity...

883
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:57,763
to speak about my own life
is of great importance.

884
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:01,650
The image of a person
in the public eye

885
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,289
never entirely corresponds to the truth.

886
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,645
It is, rather,
a collection of sources.

887
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,169
I would like to add my own truth
to this collection of sources.

888
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,447
That's all.

889
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:16,124
You mean the dispute
with Charles Steinbach?

890
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,882
What?
No!

891
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,924
That was in the 70s.

892
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:24,567
Back then I worked in California.

893
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,367
But that's not
the matter in question here.

894
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:29,126
I mean...

895
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,681
the Third Reich.

896
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:40,164
But your time as a regime-conform
academic has been described...

897
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:43,610
on many occasions
and at length... by you.

898
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,281
It has?

899
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,320
In your coming-to-terms
with a career in the Third Reich.

900
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,165
Yes.

901
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:53,446
And in your book...

902
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,165
"A Chance to Talk"

903
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,730
you describe yourself as
"a blinded young man"

904
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,968
and say it is...

905
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:02,926
a shameful thing...

906
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:07,688
that you kept your chair
for National Psychology throughout.

907
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:10,447
That cannot be!
Show me.

908
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,489
Hey, are you putting me on?

909
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:22,324
Where's the damn bag?
- I gave it to you.

910
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,409
It's not there...

911
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,925
Get it or you'll be sorry!

912
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:29,366
I...

913
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,447
Due to my age, I have...

914
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,605
forgotten many things.

915
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:40,122
My explanations
seem to me, today,

916
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,890
rather worthless.

917
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:43,805
What I would say today is...

918
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,407
that I regret what I did,

919
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,571
and that this guilt

920
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,963
will remain a visible part of me.

921
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,449
An outrage!

922
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,091
Stop him.

923
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:03,169
You're staying here!

924
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,205
Stop him!
- Yes.

925
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,444
I've got him!

926
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,680
<i>Watch out! For God's sake...
Clear the area!</i>

927
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,328
<i>Everybody run!
- It's an emergency!</i>

928
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,925
I've got him!

929
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,528
<i>Clear the area!
- Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

930
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,090
<i>Baby, I love you!</i>

931
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,248
<i>I love you!
- Scram! Scram!</i>

932
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:46,924
Look who's here!
- Well yes...

933
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,484
I said what I had to say.

934
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,446
But nobody listened.

935
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,403
Sorry, what?

936
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:57,763
What are you doing now?
- I'm going to kidnap you,

937
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,363
and demand 10,000 in ransom.

938
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,329
And if your family doesn't pay,

939
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:05,609
I'll turn you over to Israel.

940
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:07,520
Oh, I like it there.

941
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:14,171
What are you reading?

942
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:17,527
"A Chance to Talk".
Curt Ledig.

943
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,689
I'd read my own books, too.

944
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,565
You write?

945
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:26,121
