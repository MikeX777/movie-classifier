1
00:00:00,449 --> 00:00:02,449
In the Name of God

2
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,668
Nobody can claim to know
everything about Qolam Reza Takhti.

3
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:23,543
Things at hand are nothing
but a bunch of memories.

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,690
I've witnessed some stuff within these
years and heard some others...

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,396
from his friends and companions,
I've guessed some as well.

6
00:00:31,972 --> 00:00:34,542
I've connected some issues to each
other by means of my imagination.

7
00:00:35,381 --> 00:00:37,841
If someone really wants
to know Qolam Reza Takhti...

8
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:41,055
...he needs to listen carefully
to every single word of his will.

9
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:46,044
This is the will for which Takhti went
to the hotel for the last time to make it.

10
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:49,581
The hotel in which the body of Qolam
Reza Takhti was found the next day.

11
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:54,084
...in room No. 23
I have a copy of the will.

12
00:00:56,378 --> 00:01:02,292
Hereby I, Qolam Reza Takhti, Rajab's
son, born on August 27 1930...

13
00:01:02,317 --> 00:01:07,111
...in Tehran with the ID number 500,
write this will in good state of mind...

14
00:01:07,136 --> 00:01:12,175
...and declare that I offer the house
of Shemiran to my two sisters...

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,056
...to use it as long as they live.

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,359
And later transfer it to my son,
Babak, if he'd live after their death.

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,312
My medals would belong to my dear
Babak if he was of age, but leave...

18
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:28,291
...them at Imam Reza's museum for
my dear son as he's only 4 months old.

19
00:01:28,316 --> 00:01:29,715
There's nothing more to say.

20
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:37,033
My medals would belong to my dear
Babak if he was of age, but leave...

21
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:42,741
...them at Imam Reza's museum for
my dear son as he's only 4 months old.

22
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:50,100
There's nothing more to say.
Here is the list of my debts.

23
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:56,941
Merikh Benz Company, 50000 bucks.
Amir Khan, 2000 bucks.

24
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:02,817
Parviz Khan Beizaee, 2000 bucks.
Ruhollah Salimi, 500 bucks.

25
00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:08,474
Nikou Salimi, 5000 bucks.
Hajji Hussein Khaleh, 5000 bucks.

26
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:10,940
Do you approve
the contents of this will?

27
00:02:12,103 --> 00:02:14,412
- Yes.
- Finished.

28
00:02:17,518 --> 00:02:18,534
It's ready.

29
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,202
Hand me the stamp.

30
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:32,534
Sign below both pages.

31
00:02:48,253 --> 00:03:01,253
Qolam Reza Takhti

32
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:07,624
Why are you hesitating, girl?
Tell him about your trouble.

33
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:12,321
It's not a shame to ask for help,
especially from Takhti.

34
00:04:13,094 --> 00:04:17,773
I've got butterflies in my stomach.
My lips get locked when l see him.

35
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:24,802
Repeat the words you wanna tell him
so you won't panic when you see him.

36
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:26,729
He is a very humble person.

37
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:31,465
There's no need to panic.
He's been in this hotel for two nights.

38
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:34,515
But you hesitate to speak up
whenever you see him.

39
00:04:34,938 --> 00:04:37,533
Do you wanna sort
your life out or not?

40
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,288
- Hello
- Hi, a glass of water for room No. 23.

41
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:38,992
Room No. 23
Sure.

42
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,574
- Hello.
- Hi.

43
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:54,350
- Is Babak doing well?
- He's fine, asleep.

44
00:05:54,496 --> 00:05:56,981
- I won't come home tonight.
- What do you mean?

45
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,238
You knew we were expecting guests.
Where did you go?

46
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:17,401
- Hello
- Hi.

47
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:20,467
The license of the flower shop was
revoked because of partnering with you.

48
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:21,550
I'm not in anymore.

49
00:06:22,138 --> 00:06:24,597
Look after my family
if something would happen.

50
00:06:24,622 --> 00:06:26,957
- What?
- My mother is unwell.

51
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:29,613
- What on earth are you saying?
- Babak is still fragile.

52
00:06:29,993 --> 00:06:32,512
Don't count on me anymore.
I give up.

53
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,031
- Hi.
- Hello.

54
00:06:42,023 --> 00:06:43,023
Thank you.

55
00:07:07,298 --> 00:07:09,098
Qolam Reza!
Qolam Reza!

56
00:07:12,116 --> 00:07:13,116
My God!

57
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:17,855
O. Imam Reza!

58
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,080
Sweetie!

59
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:28,096
Mother!
He threw him in water on purpose.

60
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:31,335
Hassan witnessed it.
Come say it to mother, Hassan.

61
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,430
Hassan! Hassan!

62
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,748
Leili is right, mother.
Qolam wrestled Asqar to the ground.

63
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:39,801
So Asqar threw him in
the dirt water to take revenge.

64
00:07:41,742 --> 00:07:46,958
If your uncle hadn't given you that room.
You'd be in a mess with your crazy dad.

65
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:52,760
- Qolam Reza!
- Mother champ!

66
00:08:05,916 --> 00:08:08,214
Oh, stop beating him!
Let go of him!

67
00:08:15,758 --> 00:08:16,796
Qolam Reza!

68
00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:19,299
Qolam Reza!
Qolam Reza!

69
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:22,000
Qolam Reza is beating
Asqar in head with a stick, mother.

70
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,666
Qolam Reza!

71
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,466
If someone shoves you.
He aims to provoke you.

72
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:32,181
You must not hurt anyone,
no matter what!

73
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,729
Go take your dad home
He is in bazaar.

74
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:36,432
Go ahead, son.

75
00:08:41,878 --> 00:08:45,162
Stop beating each other!
Let go of him.

76
00:10:00,261 --> 00:10:02,779
- I was shivering with cold.
- Seriously

77
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:06,151
I had a clothing of camel wool that my
father-in-law had taken from Karbala.

78
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,398
- Dad!
- I wore it and go in the glacier.

79
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:12,613
I was still shivering with cold.
I had an ice-box as big as this.

80
00:10:12,898 --> 00:10:16,222
I got it, you wanna borrow some money.
Just tell me when you'll pay it back.

81
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:17,051
Say this!

82
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:21,218
I start to pray. But the cops
raided worse than the earthquake.

83
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:23,646
They said my glacier was
situated on the way of the railroad.

84
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:26,646
So I lost my property.
I'm not a beggar.

85
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:29,505
People are tearing each other
down for a bowl of flour.

86
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,080
You wanna get money without talking
That's not possible.

87
00:10:32,105 --> 00:10:34,563
You just messed with
the glacier of Master Rajab.

88
00:10:34,588 --> 00:10:38,587
I recall he was running a business.
I lent him money the previous time.

89
00:10:38,674 --> 00:10:42,207
Give him some money and stop
interrogating him for information.

90
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:45,205
It's an immoral act.
The money is given to the Scrooge.

91
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,259
My house was shaking.
Five cops raided my house.

92
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:52,390
- You said there were three last time.
- The cops are born in his mind.

93
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:53,509
There were five cops.

94
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:56,839
They kicked me out
of my glacier and house.

95
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,706
They threw all my
belongings in the alley.

96
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:02,798
- Did you sleep in the alley?
- Tell them where we slept for 2 nights.

97
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:07,126
Cat got your tongue, kid?
Say what happened in those 2 nights.

98
00:11:07,151 --> 00:11:10,150
He brings his kid to make people pity
for him and collect money from them.

99
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:11,087
This is his business.

100
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:16,262
Take a more credible witness next time.
So that people would believe you.

101
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:20,813
I won't lend you this time to make
you remember, I won't lend till...

102
00:11:20,838 --> 00:11:24,117
...you pay off your installments.
- Clear the way!

103
00:11:30,302 --> 00:11:33,421
Your dad can't find his house
and you lug him.

104
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:35,834
Crazy Rajab!

105
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:18,314
Narges!
Feteh a bowl of water for your dad.

106
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:16,377
Look at him!
He is crying.

107
00:13:17,982 --> 00:13:19,861
Don't wet yourself, lazy Qolam!

108
00:13:41,063 --> 00:13:42,026
Kick his leg!

109
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,749
Change!

110
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:46,645
[Masjed Soleyman : 7 years later]

111
00:13:46,854 --> 00:13:47,853
Cradle!

112
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:53,315
Get up.
No need to do it.

113
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,075
Frapple again.
Fireman's carry.

114
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:04,812
Go for the double leg.

115
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:09,948
He can't do a double leg!
Go for the single leg.

116
00:14:15,016 --> 00:14:16,135
Reverse takedown.

117
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,668
No need.
Sit and do a leg scissors.

118
00:14:26,786 --> 00:14:27,785
Leg scissors!

119
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,673
His leg doesn't bend.

120
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:34,252
His leg doesn't bend!

121
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,043
Reverse chicken wing.

122
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:46,624
No need, get up.
I give up the techniques.

123
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,500
Run a little.
I wanna see if you could run at all.

124
00:14:50,466 --> 00:14:51,758
Look at him carefully.

125
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:56,696
He weaves and zigzags.
Look at his posture.

126
00:14:56,981 --> 00:14:59,966
As if he's begging his opponent
to hit him in the head!

127
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:04,723
In such persons, neither their bodies
nor their mind is useful for wrestling.

128
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:09,103
His back is in the air and
his head is down while wrestling.

129
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:10,623
Stop!
No need to run.

130
00:15:11,196 --> 00:15:14,818
If you wanna do well in wrestling,
look at this person.

131
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:19,262
Don't do whatever he does.
You'll surely be nice wrestlers then.

132
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:20,487
What should I do to be corrected?

133
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:23,751
The first thing to do is
forgetting about sports and living on.

134
00:15:24,692 --> 00:15:26,200
Everybody, come to grapple.

135
00:15:33,536 --> 00:15:35,602
Don't slouch!
Straighten up.

136
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,959
Hold your head up.
See what your opponent is doing.

137
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,421
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

138
00:15:44,928 --> 00:15:47,198
Goddamn you!
You can't even stand on your feet.

139
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,249
Are you lame?
Stand in the right position.

140
00:15:49,308 --> 00:15:55,876
Working in Masjed Soleyman was lifting
heavy weights, pain at night, being...

141
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:59,820
...defeated on and on, not getting
disappointed, practicing and loneliness.

142
00:15:59,898 --> 00:16:03,844
But being away from the family and
his mother was annoying him the most.

143
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:05,758
It must be as clean as a new pin.

144
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:10,406
- Lift it.
- Listen carefully, boy.

145
00:16:10,724 --> 00:16:15,603
Nagging and asking for leave to
go home is what the children do.

146
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:19,956
Here, I'm your mother, father
and everybody else you've got.

147
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,021
I wanna make real men out of you, so
you could stand on your own two feet.

148
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:29,068
I don't wanna train a bunch
of miserable mean individuals.

149
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:35,412
If you wanna grow high and mighty, the
family is the first hindrance on your way.

150
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:39,866
You should forget about the family
in the first place and stick to your job.

151
00:16:40,362 --> 00:16:42,483
Don't come to me
to ask for a leave again.

152
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:44,829
Don't think that
I'll forget your face.

153
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:49,473
I've got a remarkable memory.
Get going.

154
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:16,728
In the Name of God
the Compassionate, the Merciful!

155
00:17:24,257 --> 00:17:31,195
The Compassionate!
The Merciful!

156
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:09,856
I'm so sorry that the Recruitment
Department of Masjed Soleyman...

157
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:13,371
...Oil Company didn't accept
my request of a leave for a month.

158
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:20,097
As I hold my mother in high esteem and
she's asked me to pay a visit to her,...

159
00:18:20,648 --> 00:18:23,487
...I have no other choice,
but obeying my mother's command.

160
00:18:23,512 --> 00:18:28,817
And as my request for a leave was not
accepted, please accept my resignation.

161
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:29,911
Qolam Reza Takhti.

162
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:42,811
Hajji Feli is the one who's coming down.
Pay attention and be strong.

163
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:46,338
Everyone he pick's for exercising
will grow high and mighty.

164
00:18:47,236 --> 00:18:50,435
Be strong!
Do your techniques on him.

165
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,070
- Don't be scared.
- Get together!

166
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:58,449
Whoever I'm gonna call should
do the technique he is master in.

167
00:18:58,648 --> 00:18:59,648
Go ahead.

168
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,879
Don't be feeble!

169
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,441
Hold your head up.

170
00:19:10,256 --> 00:19:11,895
Haven't you had breakfast?

171
00:19:19,228 --> 00:19:19,957
Go ahead.

172
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:30,210
Bravo!

173
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:38,613
What's your name?

174
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:40,962
Qolam Reza Takhti.

175
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:46,148
Rather than the techniques, he learnt
the meaning of wrestling from Hajji Feli.

176
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,049
Feli was from the last
generation of the coaches...

177
00:19:49,074 --> 00:19:52,255
...for whom the chivalry of wrestling
was prior to its championship.

178
00:19:52,602 --> 00:19:55,601
Soon, Takhti became
the star of Poulad club.

179
00:19:58,607 --> 00:19:59,547
Clap your hands!

180
00:20:00,663 --> 00:20:02,009
Bravo,
Clap your hands.

181
00:20:17,472 --> 00:20:18,472
Any news?

182
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:22,651
Any news?

183
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:42,110
Hold on, Qolam Reza.

184
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:46,835
You practiced day and night and now
that the day has come, you chicken out?

185
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,647
It's the qualifying matches
for the National Team.

186
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:51,202
You'll join the National Team
if you win this wrestling match.

187
00:20:51,227 --> 00:20:52,077
Look at me.

188
00:20:52,724 --> 00:20:56,821
We wrestle for the enjoyment of those
who come to watch us, not for winning.

189
00:20:56,905 --> 00:21:00,450
Don't think about winning or losing.
Think about the enjoyment of the viewers.

190
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:03,789
It's better to leave here
as a loser than a coward.

191
00:21:03,814 --> 00:21:04,493
Come on!

192
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:14,357
Poulad Club lads!
Why are you standing here?

193
00:21:14,485 --> 00:21:16,781
Go in the tent.
Come on!

194
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,496
Big up to you!
You rock!

195
00:21:41,521 --> 00:21:42,843
You were perfect, boy.

196
00:21:42,984 --> 00:21:44,422
[World Championship]
[Helsinki, 1951]

197
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:50,265
Qolam Reza Takhti, 22 years old, the
unknown figure of the competitions...

198
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:53,821
...till a few days ago, goes to the
final competition at the sixth weight...

199
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:58,125
...with his spectacular brilliance
and five successive victories.

200
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,095
He made a breakthrough
in the stadium. Hello?

201
00:22:00,228 --> 00:22:03,947
He's already made to be
the vice champion in the first...

202
00:22:03,972 --> 00:22:08,559
...world competition in Helsinki,
Finland, and Qolam Reza Takhti...

203
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:14,387
...really deserves to be nicknamed
as the fresh star of the competitions.

204
00:22:14,449 --> 00:22:18,051
Has a new figure joined the
wrestling champions of the world?

205
00:22:18,076 --> 00:22:21,097
The very last sentence is the title.
I'll call you later again, bye.

206
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:27,366
The 1951 World Championships in
Helsinki, Finland, was my first trip...

207
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:30,127
...with the National Team to
make the reports of the competitions.

208
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,997
It was the first significant
competition of Qolam Reza Takhti.

209
00:22:33,022 --> 00:22:34,666
- Where's Qolam Reza?
- He left the saloon.

210
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:36,357
He was with Bolour.
They were heading the locker room.

211
00:22:36,382 --> 00:22:40,021
As far as I recall, all teammates were
happy about Qolam Reza's silver medal.

212
00:22:40,762 --> 00:22:44,441
What I remember about Helsinki are
the smiles, good spirits as well as...

213
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:48,513
...running on and on in the halls
to record the smiles with my camera.

214
00:22:56,141 --> 00:23:00,060
Take the photos, I need him.
He should treat us for his victory.

215
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:05,124
- Bravo!
- Be careful not to let him fall.

216
00:23:53,831 --> 00:23:57,101
Please Qolam Reza, have a glass
and drink to our friendship.

217
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:59,339
Won't you even drink to our friendship?

218
00:23:59,484 --> 00:24:01,136
Alcohol doesn't suit me, dear friend.

219
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,301
Look at us, coming out
to celebrate his silver medal...

220
00:24:05,815 --> 00:24:06,830
...but he wouldn't drink with us.

221
00:24:06,963 --> 00:24:09,196
Well done, cheering your friend!

222
00:24:09,947 --> 00:24:12,246
It's okay, I'll drink
on behalf of both of us...

223
00:24:12,704 --> 00:24:16,019
...to our friendship, that
nothing ever can break it.

224
00:24:16,903 --> 00:24:20,720
If we've got each other's back,
we'll make such a golden days.

225
00:24:21,035 --> 00:24:23,044
The future is ours, Qolam Reza.

226
00:24:28,018 --> 00:24:28,922
You will see!

227
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:32,162
- I promise.
- Great, have fun.

228
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,425
Don't worry, we're having fun.

229
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,993
Let's go

230
00:24:57,854 --> 00:24:59,573
- Come on, coach.
- I can't dance.

231
00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:33,039
May uncle rest in peace!
He saved us from being displaced.

232
00:25:33,236 --> 00:25:35,955
He brought us to this
house and supported us.

233
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,313
I'll never forget his favors.
Nice halva!

234
00:25:40,287 --> 00:25:43,522
Leili, I was sure that
Qolam Reza had forgotten...

235
00:25:43,547 --> 00:25:46,123
...you as you were gone from the
neighborhood for a couple of years.

236
00:25:46,195 --> 00:25:50,480
To address you I said the little girl who
used to throw stones at everybody.

237
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:53,077
Me?
Throwing stones?

238
00:25:53,102 --> 00:25:55,346
- Didn't you?
- No, I don't remember.

239
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:56,849
The victims do remember it.

240
00:25:57,053 --> 00:26:00,681
Do you wanna take halva for the crowd
of men and ask Qolam Reza in person?

241
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:03,120
You're mischievous,
no matter what!

242
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:12,470
- Here you are.
- God bless his soul!

243
00:26:12,495 --> 00:26:13,014
Khadijeh!

244
00:26:15,255 --> 00:26:15,769
Khadijeh!

245
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,691
- Did you tell Qolam Reza?
- What?

246
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:25,946
My employment will be ok if he talks
about it just once with General.

247
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:28,493
- The head of the National Team.
- Why don't you tell him?

248
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:31,174
You're his darling sister.
He won't object you.

249
00:26:31,295 --> 00:26:34,774
Aren't you his brother?
You wouldn't be ashamed to...

250
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,807
...talk to Qolam Reza if you hadn't
snitched on your former employer.

251
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:42,203
- Take this plate of halva too.
- You never did me any good.

252
00:26:55,969 --> 00:26:59,768
In your late uncle's words, you can
live the life of Riley if you're affluent.

253
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,272
Where do I get money to give them?

254
00:27:02,451 --> 00:27:04,750
You did a favor and went
with me to the Municipality.

255
00:27:04,846 --> 00:27:09,856
I've got a letter from the Municipality
to go to God knows what commission.

256
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:12,127
- Hi, thanks for coming.
- Hello, don't mention it.

257
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:15,171
Otherwise, I'm gonna
lose my small shop.

258
00:27:15,461 --> 00:27:18,225
If only they realize I'm a friend
of Takhti, the world champion...

259
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:21,245
...they'll give an inch stamp this letter
and then everything will be over.

260
00:27:21,615 --> 00:27:24,952
- Ok, I'll go with you again.
- Thank you.

261
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:25,867
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

262
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:28,888
I hold you in high regard
since your childhood.

263
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:29,614
Thank you.

264
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:33,744
You're the pride of Khani Abad
neighborhood, Tehran and Iran.

265
00:27:35,418 --> 00:27:38,261
Did you really remember me?
Your childhood playmate.

266
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:40,223
Yes, I did.

267
00:27:40,538 --> 00:27:43,241
But you don't even look at me.
How could you remember me?

268
00:27:43,881 --> 00:27:48,641
- I remember you threw stones at kids.
- Is it the only thing you recall of me?

269
00:27:49,776 --> 00:27:50,400
No.

270
00:27:51,722 --> 00:27:55,402
I always thought Asqar was the one to
become a wrestler between you two.

271
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,567
Yeah, Asqar was the strongest.

272
00:27:58,035 --> 00:28:01,614
I sometimes come to your house
to teach Khadijeh and Narges.

273
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:03,858
Thank you.

274
00:28:06,908 --> 00:28:09,006
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

275
00:28:14,313 --> 00:28:18,332
1953 Iranian coup d'etat was the
experience of failure for people.

276
00:28:18,966 --> 00:28:21,544
The competitions of the National Team
wore suspended and Takhti spent...

277
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:24,164
his entire time for the people
of the neighborhood those days.

278
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:27,631
He used to go to different offices
to follow up people's tasks.

279
00:28:28,118 --> 00:28:30,977
People were about to getting
to know this feature of Takhti.

280
00:28:31,629 --> 00:28:35,040
They felt there was someone
who cared for them, especially...

281
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:37,726
in the situation of still being
depressed for that tremendous failure.

282
00:28:47,877 --> 00:28:52,868
[Takhti: Failure must be forgotten.
Be awake, the country is in danger.]

283
00:28:54,173 --> 00:28:55,173
Hello.

284
00:29:13,482 --> 00:29:14,683
- Hi Takhti.
- Hello.

285
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:17,061
- Hi Takhti.
- Hello.

286
00:29:18,739 --> 00:29:19,956
- Hello.
- Hi Jahan.

287
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:25,424
Have you flavored it
with lemon juice?

288
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:29,814
You mean I'd forget that my homeboy
eats Faloodeh with lemon juice?

289
00:29:30,174 --> 00:29:31,009
Thank you.

290
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,420
Who's the old man
who visits you every week?

291
00:29:33,574 --> 00:29:35,786
A poor guy who's lost
his job due to his sickness.

292
00:29:36,228 --> 00:29:39,898
- It tastes like our childhood.
- Nothing is like the childhood anymore.

293
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,595
Remember Asqar Alieh choked
you with hands out of anger...

294
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,148
...when he wrestled you
to the ground?

295
00:29:45,258 --> 00:29:48,030
- He had a temper since childhood.
- You recalled Asqar!

296
00:29:48,508 --> 00:29:51,694
When you were not in Iran,
Asqar went to the gym,

297
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:54,980
pulled your photo off the wall,
and broke it out of jealousy.

298
00:29:55,272 --> 00:29:59,041
He made a fuss and said, ''Who the hell
is Takhti to hang his photo on the wall?"

299
00:29:59,261 --> 00:30:02,371
I wanted to brawl with him,
but found him in terrible conditions.

300
00:30:02,451 --> 00:30:05,681
He's addicted to opium and
hangs on here and there all the time.

301
00:30:05,969 --> 00:30:07,052
Shame on you!

302
00:30:07,077 --> 00:30:09,551
Should others care for your homeboy
as you've forgotten about him?

303
00:30:09,576 --> 00:30:10,292
Where is he now?

304
00:30:10,632 --> 00:30:12,916
We admitted him to quit
a couple of times, but it's useless.

305
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:15,519
- He won't be corrected.
- I'm gonna admit him again.

306
00:30:16,307 --> 00:30:17,808
Let's pay him a visit tonight.

307
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:24,080
If I have a booth of my own,
I'll be at ease to save some money...

308
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:27,450
...for all the poor
homeboys every month.

309
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:32,487
- What do you wanna sell in your booth?
- Flowers, flowerpots and stuff like that.

310
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:35,376
Flowers are nice.
The money will be provided.

311
00:30:36,262 --> 00:30:38,326
No worries.
I thought there was enough time...

312
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:40,659
...after the coup d'etat since
there was no competitions.

313
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,838
I talked to the owner of the burnt
factory to clean up a space of it...

314
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:47,803
...bring the kids of the neighborhood
together and supervise them.

315
00:30:47,982 --> 00:30:50,487
They might get away from the mess
under the pretext of wrestling.

316
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:54,699
I'm in, I'll bring some brushes and color
to paint the walls and have it tidied up.

317
00:30:55,148 --> 00:30:58,641
Why do you give
him money to harass me?

318
00:30:59,087 --> 00:31:02,098
Do you have to give money
to anyone who asks you for it?

319
00:31:02,123 --> 00:31:03,528
Hello mother!
What's up?

320
00:31:03,607 --> 00:31:05,048
You don't need
to get out of the car.

321
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:08,359
Don't you ever give money to
the old man you just gave money to.

322
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:12,683
He's already spent all the money
you've given to him for me.

323
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:18,363
He's bought flowers, perfumes, sweets,
clothes and any gifts you could think of!

324
00:31:18,514 --> 00:31:21,513
He isn't ashamed of himself
to be after me at this old age.

325
00:31:21,627 --> 00:31:23,540
You have no idea
what the hell he's done!

326
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:27,303
He's got a gold tooth
to curry favor with me.

327
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,852
It's a shame!
Don't give him money again.

328
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:34,796
- He might forget about me then.
- Ok mother.

329
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:38,798
- Don't give him money again!
- Ok, rest assured.

330
00:31:40,364 --> 00:31:41,905
You've got Faloodeh on your shirt.

331
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:47,175
He's got a gold tooth
to curry favor with me!

332
00:31:47,751 --> 00:31:48,950
It's a shame!

333
00:31:53,888 --> 00:31:57,007
Hold on to have
the place cleaned up.

334
00:32:05,014 --> 00:32:10,555
Morteza, you need to block his leg
here to wrestle him to the ground.

335
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,148
Look, like this!

336
00:32:13,228 --> 00:32:14,728
Qolam Reza!
You're even worse than them.

337
00:32:16,614 --> 00:32:18,880
Stretch your hand.
Bravo, fine.

338
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:23,774
Put it under his chest, ok?
Hold him tightly.

339
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:29,433
Push it with pressure.
Well done, fine.

340
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:54,314
Grapple with someone
who's the same weight as you are.

341
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:05,872
What's your name, boy?

342
00:33:07,814 --> 00:33:10,635
- Ahmad.
- Who did you come here with, Ahmad?

343
00:33:11,144 --> 00:33:12,238
Morteza!

344
00:33:14,084 --> 00:33:16,483
Come with Morteza whenever
he's gonna come to the club.

345
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:18,378
Don't stay alone at home.

346
00:33:19,385 --> 00:33:22,744
- May I whistle?
- Yeah, keep it.

347
00:33:33,781 --> 00:33:36,991
Ahmad is the referee from now on,
Grapple whenever he whistles.

348
00:33:51,007 --> 00:33:56,417
- Will my little bro become a wrestler?
- Yes, if he follows up his exercises.

349
00:33:57,788 --> 00:34:00,054
Coup d'etat was only good
for the kids of the neighborhood.

350
00:34:01,129 --> 00:34:04,103
You travel to the other countries less
and stay more in the neighborhood.

351
00:34:04,128 --> 00:34:05,327
You care for them.

352
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,212
It's said that you'd gone to
Ahmad Abad to visit Mosadeq again.

353
00:34:09,794 --> 00:34:11,816
I wasn't alone.
There were many other people too.

354
00:34:15,483 --> 00:34:17,299
I wanna study and take part
in the university entrance exam.

355
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:21,591
I thought you might've talked to Narges
and asked what Leili was doing.

356
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,759
I wanted to tell you about it
before she does.

357
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,791
It's so nice to study,
especially for the ladies.

358
00:34:28,321 --> 00:34:31,883
There was a lady doctor in Finland
who managed all the competitions.

359
00:34:34,277 --> 00:34:35,686
I'm gonna study nursing.

360
00:34:37,415 --> 00:34:39,138
Fine.
It suits you.

361
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,131
Why do you say that it suits me?
How am I like?

362
00:34:43,277 --> 00:34:46,954
You're somehow...
It generally suits you.

363
00:34:46,979 --> 00:34:48,618
Where are you, sis Leili?

364
00:35:00,706 --> 00:35:03,501
You'd asked Narges a couple of times
what Leili was up to do.

365
00:35:04,328 --> 00:35:05,442
She tells me everything.

366
00:35:09,177 --> 00:35:10,429
Do you have feelings for me?

367
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:22,064
Tell me whatever
you need from now on.

368
00:35:22,089 --> 00:35:25,142
But don't compare me to the
Finnish doctors, as I'd lose my nerve.

369
00:35:31,074 --> 00:35:33,399
I've been working at
a dressmaker's in awhile.

370
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:36,547
Those who realized I knew you, asked
me to pass these letters to you.

371
00:35:39,895 --> 00:35:40,504
- Goodbye.

372
00:35:53,035 --> 00:35:59,173
The Iranian squad parade has already
started in Melbourne Olympic Stadium.

373
00:35:59,352 --> 00:36:02,994
Qolam Reza Takhti is carrying
and waving the flag of Iran...

374
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:05,538
...as Iran's first hope
for the freestyle wrestling.

375
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:12,072
And at the right moment, Melbourne
1956 Olympic Games officially started.

376
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:09,586
The final match of freestyle wrestling
of Melbourne Olympic Games...

377
00:37:09,611 --> 00:37:12,421
...at 87 kg is gonna start in
XVI Olympiad in a few minutes...

378
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:14,901
...between the Iranian champion,
Qolam Reza Takhti,...

379
00:37:14,926 --> 00:37:18,851
...and the American wrestler,
Peter Blair.

380
00:37:18,948 --> 00:37:23,267
All the Iranian sports fans have pinned
their hopes on this previous champ...

381
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:25,461
...who's already defeated the
opponents from Africa, Denmark,

382
00:37:25,486 --> 00:37:27,988
Japan, Australia
and the Soviet Union.

383
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:32,671
Can Qolam Reza Takhti bestow the
country the most remarkable medal...

384
00:37:32,696 --> 00:37:37,214
...in the history of Iranian wrestling
by winning his last competition?

385
00:37:51,695 --> 00:37:52,463
Don't stick to him!

386
00:37:56,704 --> 00:37:57,561
Don't stick to him!

387
00:38:08,697 --> 00:38:10,576
Reposition yourself!

388
00:38:14,909 --> 00:38:15,552
Free your hand!

389
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:37,044
Sit tight, Qolam Reza.

390
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:38,404
Reposition yourself!

391
00:38:57,981 --> 00:38:59,580
Distance from him, Qolam Reza.

392
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,366
Don't stick to him.

393
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:38,413
Sit tight!

394
00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:02,571
Narrow your guard!

395
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,350
Ouch!

396
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,405
Let me see.
Help him rise.

397
00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:26,822
Hold your head up.
Doctor!

398
00:40:41,629 --> 00:40:43,501
- What's he saying?
- He says we need to cancel it.

399
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:45,240
His eye is wounded
and he can't carry on with it.

400
00:40:46,016 --> 00:40:48,630
Qolam Reza!
They say you need to give up.

401
00:40:48,711 --> 00:40:51,156
- Your eye is in a bad condition.
- I'm ok.

402
00:40:52,805 --> 00:40:53,789
I'm gonna be all right.

403
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:58,959
- Can you see?
- I can.

404
00:40:58,984 --> 00:41:01,183
- Huh?
- Tell them I can do it.

405
00:41:04,886 --> 00:41:08,850
Apparently Qolam Reza
is severely wounded in his eye.

406
00:41:09,327 --> 00:41:12,126
The jury and the Iranian
coaches are consulting on...

407
00:41:12,151 --> 00:41:14,940
...whether to stop or continue
the match due to this accident.

408
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:19,898
Sadly, I can't see our champion's face
clearly from here, but it's been too...

409
00:41:19,923 --> 00:41:23,627
...severe that the official medicine
disagreed with continuing the match.

410
00:41:23,975 --> 00:41:28,070
If the match is canceled,
in addition to losing the possibility of...

411
00:41:28,095 --> 00:41:30,113
...gaining the Olympics
gold medal in this tournament,...

412
00:41:30,138 --> 00:41:33,160
...Qolam Reza Takhti would have to
exercise for next four years with the...

413
00:41:33,185 --> 00:41:36,107
...bitter experience of this accident
which is deafly tough and unbearable.

414
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:40,652
On the other hand, if his eye injury
gets severer by pursuing the match,

415
00:41:40,817 --> 00:41:44,575
the lranian wrestling champion might
have serious vision problems forever.

416
00:41:44,807 --> 00:41:48,687
We should wait to see if he can beat
the blood that's covering his eye,

417
00:41:48,712 --> 00:41:52,458
Or he prefers not to sacrifice his health
for winning this crucial competition.

418
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:03,628
[Heroic lyrics]

419
00:44:47,443 --> 00:44:49,787
It's over!
Qolam Reza Takhti...

420
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:54,059
...gained the gold medal of Melbourne
Olympic Games with closed eyes.

421
00:44:54,188 --> 00:44:57,121
The most remarkable medal in the
history of Iranian freestyle wrestling!

422
00:46:45,188 --> 00:46:47,947
Takhti!

423
00:47:13,414 --> 00:47:15,693
Takhti!

424
00:48:49,032 --> 00:48:52,157
In Melbourne, Australia, an Iranian
champion was ranked higher than...

425
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:54,222
his opponents from the USA and
the Soviet Union for the first time.

426
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:58,229
Qolam Reza Takhti had
started his golden days while...

427
00:48:58,254 --> 00:49:00,112
...he'd gained silver medals several
times in the world competitions...

428
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:02,151
...and Olympics games before
Melbourne Olympic Games.

429
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,439
Gaining the gold medal
of Melbourne Olympic Games.

430
00:49:04,464 --> 00:49:07,523
Gaining the gold medal
of Tokyo 1958 Asian Games.

431
00:49:07,854 --> 00:49:09,276
Earning the championship
of the country for eight times.

432
00:49:09,301 --> 00:49:12,166
Winning the Championship Armlet
for three successive years.

433
00:49:12,474 --> 00:49:15,332
Earning the championship of the world
Cups and international competitions.

434
00:49:15,462 --> 00:49:17,661
All these triumphs had
made people believe that...

435
00:49:17,686 --> 00:49:20,114
...Takhti was never
to rank lower than the first.

436
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,376
He had a smile
on his lips those days.

437
00:49:22,581 --> 00:49:26,093
Each time I went to interview him after
gaining gold medals, he used to say,

438
00:49:26,429 --> 00:49:29,987
"The moment people feel happy by
hearing I gained a gold medal matters!"

439
00:49:30,245 --> 00:49:31,748
"It matters more
than gaining the medal."

440
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:34,392
"I live on for the
joy of that very moment."

441
00:49:34,581 --> 00:49:37,614
Takhti had turned to the symbol
of victory and pride for people.

442
00:49:51,984 --> 00:49:54,952
You haven't even opened it
to see what was in it.

443
00:49:57,097 --> 00:49:59,938
It's too much money.
It's too much for us.

444
00:50:00,028 --> 00:50:03,087
How's Ahmad doing?
Do you take him to the clinic?

445
00:50:03,388 --> 00:50:06,483
Yes, I take him to
the clinic you told me.

446
00:50:07,837 --> 00:50:11,368
He talks to me when
he is ok and I feel assured.

447
00:50:12,018 --> 00:50:16,057
When you have a competition,
I take him to listen to it on the radio.

448
00:50:16,594 --> 00:50:20,216
He says when Takhti wrestles, he feels
an energy in his hands and legs...

449
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,396
...like he is wrestling on the mat.

450
00:50:23,433 --> 00:50:29,443
When it was announced on the radio
that you'd injured your eyebrow,...

451
00:50:29,781 --> 00:50:31,569
...all said the competition was over,

452
00:50:32,048 --> 00:50:35,931
Ahmad said Takhti wouldn't give it up.

453
00:50:36,853 --> 00:50:40,004
Ahmad says that nobody
could ever beat Takhti after that.

454
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:48,578
God bless you!
Wish you all the best!

455
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,799
Ok, rest assured.

456
00:51:18,304 --> 00:51:22,863
Dear Takhti, whenever the Iranians
have undertaken to do something...

457
00:51:22,888 --> 00:51:25,889
...that could lead to
their freedom and prosperity,

458
00:51:26,593 --> 00:51:30,943
They've been restricted by a wall of
misunderstanding, betrayal and tyranny.

459
00:51:31,236 --> 00:51:34,251
And the result of their honest struggles
has been nothing but...

460
00:51:34,473 --> 00:51:39,345
...the public depression and committing
themselves to indifference and oblivion.

461
00:51:40,773 --> 00:51:46,905
These pure people deserve the best
joys and usually get the worst sorrows.

462
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:51,483
It's like this is the inevitable
fate of our noble nation.

463
00:51:52,377 --> 00:51:55,186
The dark fate that has
weakened our national will,

464
00:51:55,448 --> 00:51:58,270
And made the despair
domineer our country.

465
00:51:59,344 --> 00:52:04,895
Now you're the symbol of the nation's
will and their tendency toward victory.

466
00:52:05,892 --> 00:52:10,294
People now make up for their
national and social failures with...

467
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:13,381
...the sweet taste of your successes
after that ominous coup d'etat.

468
00:52:14,236 --> 00:52:17,715
If I wasn't confined under house arrest,
I would've come to welcome you and...

469
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:22,045
Kiss the hands of the one that have
cheered the depressed people of Iran.

470
00:52:22,107 --> 00:52:23,767
Dr. Mohammad Mosadeq.

471
00:52:48,163 --> 00:52:50,687
We don't know who comes here.

472
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:53,601
Wish you'd hung the photo somewhere
that wouldn't be too visible!

473
00:52:53,626 --> 00:52:55,611
- It's gonna be a trouble.
- What trouble?

474
00:52:56,237 --> 00:52:58,073
- Haven't you seen my socks?
- No.

475
00:52:58,841 --> 00:53:02,210
It looks like a joke for you, but it's a
trouble for me who's just been hired.

476
00:53:02,359 --> 00:53:04,007
Don't worry.
Nobody would take it on you.

477
00:53:04,032 --> 00:53:05,834
- Come on.
- Sis!

478
00:53:06,713 --> 00:53:09,323
Everyone is eager to find something
against us and ruin our life.

479
00:53:09,348 --> 00:53:11,032
- Mother!
- She was in the small room.

480
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:12,716
When you havn a family,
you've got responsibilities.

481
00:53:12,741 --> 00:53:14,774
- How's the baby?
- Her fever just broke.

482
00:53:16,269 --> 00:53:19,936
Do you even care for us
with so many troubles?

483
00:53:22,004 --> 00:53:25,979
You gotta forget some troublesome
beliefs for the future of your family.

484
00:53:26,004 --> 00:53:28,530
Hush, stop talking near the baby.
She just fell asleep.

485
00:53:28,555 --> 00:53:30,912
Tell him your true words
instead of hushing me.

486
00:53:31,144 --> 00:53:32,348
You're not asking
for something unjust.

487
00:53:32,373 --> 00:53:34,946
I would never speak
about it if I didn't need it.

488
00:53:35,144 --> 00:53:38,656
- He's got too many troubles.
- He brings the troubles to himself.

489
00:53:43,294 --> 00:53:44,807
I took my eyes off him
just for a single minute!

490
00:53:48,766 --> 00:53:51,517
I told you to store away
the hammer and nails from him.

491
00:53:51,542 --> 00:53:54,573
He finds them and gets on our nerves.
Damn it!

492
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:59,310
He'd scared of his shadow the other
night and threw lots of things at it.

493
00:53:59,631 --> 00:54:03,971
Nobody can manage to handle him.
I can't afford to hire a caregiver for him.

494
00:54:06,502 --> 00:54:08,501
What?
Shouldn't I say a word?

495
00:54:08,526 --> 00:54:10,077
- Do you want me to shut up?
- Father!

496
00:54:13,471 --> 00:54:15,191
Stop it, father.
Give it to me.

497
00:54:15,216 --> 00:54:17,393
I told you to put it in the storeroom.
Let go of it!

498
00:54:17,993 --> 00:54:20,078
- Sit back, father.
- He keeps hammering!

499
00:54:20,103 --> 00:54:22,009
- Father!
- He gets on our nerves.

500
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:25,000
- Off your hands!
- Let go of his hand.

501
00:54:27,489 --> 00:54:29,393
- Off your hands!
- Why don't you just calm down?

502
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:31,684
What do you want
from Qolam Reza again?

503
00:54:31,709 --> 00:54:34,937
The boy can not work miracles for you.
Should he handle your father too?

504
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,011
- Do you say prayers or eavesdrop?
- Go!

505
00:54:37,252 --> 00:54:38,435
- Enough is enough.
- Am I the bad guy now?

506
00:54:38,823 --> 00:54:41,843
Will he always be an Olympic champion?
We should care about ourselves now.

507
00:54:41,868 --> 00:54:43,207
- Stop it!
- What are you saying?

508
00:54:43,591 --> 00:54:47,221
Shouldn't Khadijeh have a small house
of her own to live at ease...

509
00:54:47,246 --> 00:54:49,475
...instead of living in one of these
rooms with his husband and baby?

510
00:54:50,382 --> 00:54:52,455
You pretend not to have
any expectations from him.

511
00:54:52,781 --> 00:54:55,625
But you're all waiting for
Qolam Reza to work miracles for you.

512
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,722
You just don't speak of it.

513
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:05,402
Listen to doctors and nurses here.
Bat your meals on time.

514
00:55:06,383 --> 00:55:09,619
In your own words,
don't drink water during the meals.

515
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,988
Let the tea get a little cold
and then drink it.

516
00:55:13,783 --> 00:55:16,652
Don't be embarrassed to let them
know if you need anything at night.

517
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:19,850
That's be much better
if you don't drink tea at night.

518
00:55:27,049 --> 00:55:29,396
These are fake flowers.
They have no smell.

519
00:55:29,421 --> 00:55:30,421
Give them to me.

520
00:55:31,672 --> 00:55:33,472
Let me put them back in their place.
Give them to me.

521
00:55:36,316 --> 00:55:40,355
Give mother's Misbaha that's from Karbala
as she won't fall asleep without it.

522
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:44,084
Why do you go to her prayer mat?
Where are you heading?

523
00:55:44,945 --> 00:55:48,382
Do you think that I'm not
strong enough to open your fist?

524
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:50,020
Give it to me.

525
00:55:51,377 --> 00:55:52,736
Give it to me, father.

526
00:55:58,259 --> 00:55:59,378
Excuse me.

527
00:55:59,922 --> 00:56:02,211
Ok, keep it.
Sit back on your bed.

528
00:56:09,852 --> 00:56:11,051
Sit back on your bed.

529
00:56:15,165 --> 00:56:15,977
Thanks.

530
00:56:17,644 --> 00:56:19,250
Excuse me, Takhti.

531
00:56:20,508 --> 00:56:23,654
- I have a word with you.
- Go ahead.

532
00:56:24,363 --> 00:56:29,162
Excuse me, I know you're admitting
your father and it's not a good time.

533
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:33,349
But I have no idea
who to talk to except you.

534
00:56:33,897 --> 00:56:34,776
What's up?

535
00:56:37,302 --> 00:56:41,807
My husband has lost his job for a year.
He can do the technical stuff.

536
00:56:42,723 --> 00:56:45,229
We have the reference letter
from his former employer.

537
00:56:45,254 --> 00:56:49,234
Don't worry, write my phone number
and tell your husband to give me a call.

538
00:56:49,994 --> 00:56:53,300
We'll see a few friends of mine
and he'll get a job, rest assured.

539
00:56:53,766 --> 00:56:55,765
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

540
00:57:04,385 --> 00:57:06,944
I'll come to visit you soon.
Take care.

541
00:57:09,109 --> 00:57:11,193
Bear in mind my advice.

542
00:57:15,183 --> 00:57:15,942
Bye.

543
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:42,702
I don't remember any time of Takhti's
life in which he had no financial issues.

544
00:57:43,129 --> 00:57:45,648
He used to donate people
more than he earned.

545
00:57:45,828 --> 00:57:48,514
That was why he was
always trying to provide money.

546
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:50,344
Everybody had expectations from him.

547
00:57:50,685 --> 00:57:53,642
He's turned to an elder brother for
people who had to be burdened...

548
00:57:53,667 --> 00:57:59,211
...by their problems and never said
a word of the pressure he was under.

549
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:10,157
You should pay money
with every single move.

550
00:58:10,673 --> 00:58:13,098
You don't just have your family.

551
00:58:13,331 --> 00:58:15,377
There'll be a crowd more miserable
than the disable boy to whom you...

552
00:58:15,402 --> 00:58:19,243
...donated your gold coins without even
counting and you'll be fed up with them.

553
00:58:19,674 --> 00:58:22,196
You'll become the master key of
having everyone's prayers answered.

554
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:23,591
You'll see!

555
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:27,303
Are you afraid that I'd be left with
nothing and become a burden to you?

556
00:58:27,529 --> 00:58:30,250
You're my big man.
Everything I have is yours.

557
00:58:30,459 --> 00:58:33,482
I have this flower shop thanks to
the booth you lent me money to get...

558
00:58:33,507 --> 00:58:36,240
...and I've not paid it back yet.
I won't forget it.

559
00:58:36,993 --> 00:58:39,999
Why would I be afraid of destitution?
How much would I need for myself?

560
00:58:40,061 --> 00:58:42,747
Two meals to eat and
a meter of space to sleep at!

561
00:58:42,772 --> 00:58:46,099
Do you eat two meals, Qolam Reza?
You eat twice for each meal!

562
00:58:46,124 --> 00:58:48,679
- Bring the water, Mashallah.
- I just said it.

563
00:58:48,882 --> 00:58:51,780
Last time we talked, we agreed on
being partners in selling the flowers.

564
00:58:51,949 --> 00:58:53,472
I'm looking for a job.

565
00:58:54,575 --> 00:58:57,232
How much do you think selling
the flowers would make? Thanks.

566
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:02,551
I wanna say that you're the
hope of a nation with this eminence.

567
00:59:02,807 --> 00:59:04,474
You have to care
for the others nonstop.

568
00:59:04,664 --> 00:59:10,476
You have to give back the envelopes
that are sent to you with banknotes.

569
00:59:14,744 --> 00:59:15,415
What's this?

570
00:59:16,331 --> 00:59:20,077
Someone knew here was your
hangout and paid me a visit yesterday.

571
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,770
He's the factory owner of this honey.

572
00:59:21,907 --> 00:59:25,074
He'll pay you 300 grand in cash to
have your photo on the honey jars.

573
00:59:26,784 --> 00:59:28,972
He surely wants to put my
photo instead of the bee's!

574
00:59:28,997 --> 00:59:30,950
Take it seriously, Qolam Reza.

575
00:59:31,764 --> 00:59:34,041
They sent several guys for
a two minute the ad of the razor...

576
00:59:34,066 --> 00:59:36,073
...and for which they'd pay 200 grand,
but you didn't accept it.

577
00:59:36,098 --> 00:59:38,419
You didn't accept the movie offer either.
Please take this one seriously.

578
00:59:39,267 --> 00:59:43,119
Come on, if I put my photo on the
honey jar, the poor kids would think...

579
00:59:43,144 --> 00:59:45,801
...that I've become like this
by eating honey every morning!

580
00:59:46,126 --> 00:59:48,764
They can't afford to buy honey
and this will upset them even more.

581
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:49,988
Pass me the spoon.

582
00:59:50,431 --> 00:59:54,430
I ate nothing but dust in childhood,
Why would I deceive people?

583
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:59,945
Nice honey!
Stub the bloody thing out.

584
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,584
What are you doing here?
Get back inside.

585
01:00:18,236 --> 01:00:19,715
Don't stand here.
Go!

586
01:00:21,936 --> 01:00:23,815
Como on!
Don't stop.

587
01:00:25,311 --> 01:00:26,470
Don't look.
Go!

588
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:39,949
When I catch a cold just
about a competition's date,

589
01:00:39,974 --> 01:00:42,066
the mixture of ginger, lemon
and honey is the best remedy for it.

590
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,988
I didn't want it to be like this.

591
01:00:48,655 --> 01:00:50,922
My university professors
encouraged me to do it.

592
01:00:51,531 --> 01:00:55,814
I sent an application along with
my credits and it was accepted.

593
01:00:57,204 --> 01:00:58,953
Is it the field of study you like?

594
01:01:00,631 --> 01:01:04,041
Yep. medicine.
It's a good university.

595
01:01:04,391 --> 01:01:06,266
But learning German is so difficult.

596
01:01:06,838 --> 01:01:09,038
Nothing is difficult for you.
You're gonna learn it quickly.

597
01:01:09,181 --> 01:01:11,825
I'd never achieved this
if you hadn't helped me.

598
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:16,110
I'll pay back my debt
with my first salary.

599
01:01:16,996 --> 01:01:18,732
Germany is so cold.

600
01:01:18,757 --> 01:01:21,335
You should take care of your health
with such physical conditions.

601
01:01:25,831 --> 01:01:29,448
Don't forget to invite your homegirl
if anything would come up.

602
01:01:30,692 --> 01:01:31,620
For example what?

603
01:01:33,453 --> 01:01:35,331
For example,
if you're getting married.

604
01:01:36,431 --> 01:01:38,550
Or when your baby is born.
Whatever!

605
01:01:39,098 --> 01:01:42,585
Would you come from Germany
to attend my wedding party?

606
01:01:46,957 --> 01:01:50,836
- I can't manage to have a wife.
- Why not?

607
01:01:51,928 --> 01:01:55,586
I don't belong to myself.
People have expectations from me.

608
01:01:56,224 --> 01:01:59,221
If I get married, the lady would
complain why I married at all.

609
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:08,790
I would never say such a thing
if I were the lady.

610
01:02:09,376 --> 01:02:11,822
I won't leave if you tell me not to.

611
01:02:30,983 --> 01:02:33,222
Is that right to leave your
opponent in the middle of...

612
01:02:33,247 --> 01:02:34,595
...the semi final competition
of the World Championships?

613
01:02:35,403 --> 01:02:38,557
His knee made a sound
as soon as I lifted his leg.

614
01:02:38,582 --> 01:02:39,713
To hell with it!

615
01:02:39,737 --> 01:02:42,335
I told you not to be tender to your
opponent in such competitions.

616
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,685
He's wrestled him to the ground and
went for the final match, give an inch!

617
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:47,372
I would cut you in halves if
you'd lost the match, Qolam Reza.

618
01:02:47,397 --> 01:02:49,863
Congrats Qolam.
You rock!

619
01:02:49,888 --> 01:02:51,956
- Thanks.
- The next final match will be the end.

620
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:53,108
- Congrats Takhti!
- Thank you.

621
01:02:54,543 --> 01:02:58,660
Sirakov's hit Qolam in the nose during
the match and it started bleeding.

622
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:02,494
People made a fuss and
complained him for hitting Takhti.

623
01:03:02,772 --> 01:03:06,340
We kept telling them
that he was all right and...

624
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:10,037
...just bleeding in the nose as a habit,
but they didn't accept it.

625
01:03:10,062 --> 01:03:12,524
People love him anyway.
Big up to you!

626
01:03:12,549 --> 01:03:14,971
They would've loved you too
if you were astute enough.

627
01:03:14,996 --> 01:03:15,889
Astute for what?

628
01:03:15,914 --> 01:03:18,273
Didn't he ask why the meals
of the Americans were different...

629
01:03:18,298 --> 01:03:20,623
...from those of the Pakistanis
an hour ago?

630
01:03:20,989 --> 01:03:23,520
Takhti was the only wrestler
who concerned about...

631
01:03:23,545 --> 01:03:25,493
...the meals of the wrestlers
from the poor countries.

632
01:03:25,518 --> 01:03:28,769
That's why people think
of Takhti as a chivalrous man!

633
01:03:28,882 --> 01:03:30,961
And he claims not to know
anything about being astute.

634
01:03:31,219 --> 01:03:33,252
This issue will turn to
the headlines of magazines.

635
01:03:33,277 --> 01:03:35,134
The headline of Kayhan Varzeshi!

636
01:03:35,949 --> 01:03:39,188
I thought we were the host and must
not differentiate among the guests.

637
01:03:39,213 --> 01:03:43,473
I don't know if you've got problems
with Kayhan Varzeshi or Qolam Reza!

638
01:03:43,498 --> 01:03:44,929
Forget it, Mohammad.
Let's go.

639
01:03:46,033 --> 01:03:49,323
A bunch of papers exaggerate
something and people go after it.

640
01:03:49,348 --> 01:03:52,155
Each of us has gained enough medals
and taken part in various competitions.

641
01:03:52,363 --> 01:03:54,430
But people only
remember one person.

642
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:57,183
Being a champion no more depends
on doing a leg scissors technique.

643
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:00,265
You need to comply with the
magazines and he does it nicely.

644
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:02,031
- You have it in for him!
- Come, forget about him.

645
01:04:02,056 --> 01:04:05,613
Don't you walk away from me!
Even the lockers know I'm talking to you.

646
01:04:05,812 --> 01:04:07,094
Stay and answer me
if you have the guts!

647
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:09,025
- Come on!
- I don't fight with anyone.

648
01:04:09,241 --> 01:04:11,115
He's right.
What do you mean by that?

649
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:12,824
- What are you saying?
- Are we fighting with you?

650
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,756
- Listen to him.
- Yup, you don't fight with anyone.

651
01:04:14,781 --> 01:04:16,500
You've just done something for which
people have given us a hell of a time.

652
01:04:16,525 --> 01:04:19,644
You gave back the land of Gorgan
and we were attacked by the papers.

653
01:04:19,669 --> 01:04:23,427
They rebuked us for not giving back our
medals prizes as Takhti had done that.

654
01:04:23,622 --> 01:04:28,134
They'd seized the poor farmer's lands
to give us prize for our medals.

655
01:04:28,354 --> 01:04:29,993
- Is that fair?
- So?

656
01:04:30,223 --> 01:04:33,906
- The guy didn't have proper shoes.
- Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

657
01:04:33,931 --> 01:04:36,530
- There're regulations in the country.
- Let's go, bro.

658
01:04:36,555 --> 01:04:41,752
If I also was always carried on people's
hands, I'd thought I was above the law.

659
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:43,260
- What's it got to do with that, bro?
- Come on!

660
01:04:43,285 --> 01:04:46,896
I also can't find it in myself to give
back a prize of ten hectares of land.

661
01:04:46,921 --> 01:04:48,009
- Enough, forget about him.
- Understood?

662
01:04:48,034 --> 01:04:50,533
But Qolam Reza had the guts
and gave it back. He rocks!

663
01:04:50,558 --> 01:04:53,807
You also find the guts to admit you
couldn't find it in yourself to give it back.

664
01:04:53,832 --> 01:04:54,871
Why do you attack him?

665
01:04:54,896 --> 01:04:58,525
Could you ever gain an Olympic gold
medal for whose prize you're boasting?

666
01:04:58,550 --> 01:04:59,429
Of course he can't!

667
01:04:59,454 --> 01:05:02,647
If I'd be like you by gaining an Olympic
gold medal, I prefer not to gain it at all.

668
01:05:02,672 --> 01:05:07,676
- Enough!
- Tell me whose side you are?

669
01:05:07,882 --> 01:05:10,276
You receive the Championship Armlet
from Shah, breakfast with...

670
01:05:10,301 --> 01:05:15,228
...Mosadeq and lunch with Taleqani,
give a speech for raging students.

671
01:05:15,253 --> 01:05:17,226
You run with the hare
and hunt with the hounds!

672
01:05:17,251 --> 01:05:18,744
- Easy!
- You know what bothers me?

673
01:05:18,769 --> 01:05:23,124
Communists hired some viewers to
curse Qolam Reza for backing Mosadeq.

674
01:05:23,149 --> 01:05:25,699
Then he's tearing his friend in pieces
thanks to his shoulder boards.

675
01:05:25,739 --> 01:05:26,906
Shame on you!

676
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:29,386
- Which communists?
- Their leftovers.

677
01:05:29,411 --> 01:05:31,224
Go hear how the
communists are cursing!

678
01:05:31,249 --> 01:05:33,642
- Hush!
- You're someone like the rest of us.

679
01:05:33,667 --> 01:05:39,141
Those who've already lionized you
will someday vilify you.

680
01:05:39,397 --> 01:05:44,524
I have no problem with you.
Conversely, I like your astuteness.

681
01:05:44,673 --> 01:05:46,169
- Like...?
- Like a fish.

682
01:05:46,194 --> 01:05:47,809
- Yeah, you slide.
- Let him speak.

683
01:05:47,834 --> 01:05:52,716
I have problems with people's mentality
who're fooled by a couple of magazines.

684
01:05:52,741 --> 01:05:55,099
He's got problems with people
who carry you on their hands.

685
01:05:55,124 --> 01:05:56,299
- Now he's got problems with people?
- Enough!

686
01:05:56,324 --> 01:05:59,213
If you speak once again, I'll teach you
a lesson to realize how to talk to me!

687
01:05:59,238 --> 01:06:01,954
Yes, you've become a cop and
it makes you seize us by color.

688
01:06:04,614 --> 01:06:07,286
What's with you?
Do I need to tie you before the match?

689
01:06:07,311 --> 01:06:08,201
Qolam Reza!

690
01:06:08,226 --> 01:06:09,865
People have realized you're gonna
have another competition today,

691
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:11,049
They've gathered together on the mat.

692
01:06:11,074 --> 01:06:13,224
They say Takhti is exhausted
and they won't let you wrestle again.

693
01:06:13,249 --> 01:06:15,698
- Go speak to people and silence them.
- Ok, let's go.

694
01:06:15,724 --> 01:06:18,401
You're gonna have a competition too
and you fight instead of warming up!

695
01:06:18,426 --> 01:06:20,782
Some people warm up
by tearing the other in pieces.

696
01:06:20,807 --> 01:06:23,006
- You spoke again?
- Off your hands, beast!

697
01:06:23,031 --> 01:06:26,012
- What's with you?
- It's ugly, guys.

698
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:27,239
Let go of me!

699
01:06:30,498 --> 01:06:33,167
- Let go of me.
- Let go of him.

700
01:06:33,884 --> 01:06:35,403
- Let go of him!
- Guys!

701
01:06:35,428 --> 01:06:38,134
- Let go of him.
- Get going.

702
01:06:38,685 --> 01:06:42,684
Takhti!
Takhti!

703
01:06:56,344 --> 01:06:59,777
Takhti won the final match by a
knockout and hung the gold medal...

704
01:06:59,802 --> 01:07:02,355
...of Tehran 1956 World
Championship around his neck.

705
01:07:02,607 --> 01:07:04,990
I interviewed him immediately
after he gained the medal.

706
01:07:05,071 --> 01:07:06,984
I'll never forget that headline.

707
01:07:07,383 --> 01:07:10,289
He said the World Championship
doesn't make him happy at all.

708
01:07:11,656 --> 01:07:14,559
Most of his friends
were jealous of him.

709
01:07:14,916 --> 01:07:17,244
His popularity was
more than they could bear it.

710
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:20,018
They used to treat him backstab
him with different excuses.

711
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:23,989
He used to lose some friends
with each championship.

712
01:07:24,014 --> 01:07:27,027
But Takhti never took the
grudges and jealousies seriously.

713
01:07:27,687 --> 01:07:31,486
He never was after fighting
or avenging anyone one despite all,

714
01:07:31,845 --> 01:07:35,484
the troubles they brought to him.
He was after peace.

715
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,985
He went to those he found peace
by talking to them.

716
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:43,685
When Taleqani was in prison, Takhti
used to look after and help his family.

717
01:07:44,414 --> 01:07:49,099
Yes, we do have some
disagreements as he stated.

718
01:07:49,716 --> 01:07:54,726
I don't deny our disagreements.
But we are a family.

719
01:07:55,604 --> 01:08:00,241
The disagreements must be bound
to the level of those within a family.

720
01:08:01,493 --> 01:08:04,938
If we don't care about
the limits of the freedom,

721
01:08:05,402 --> 01:08:11,121
There'll gradually grow a mood
of revenge, hostility and chaos.

722
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:13,973
And the emergence of tyrants,

723
01:08:14,218 --> 01:08:18,870
Who keep excommunicating others
is the result of such a mood.

724
01:08:19,443 --> 01:08:23,405
One assumes the other as reactionary
or the other regards him as deviant.

725
01:08:24,956 --> 01:08:29,195
We must raise the
flag of mercy in the first place.

726
01:08:30,495 --> 01:08:36,414
Hence, we should invite our
opposing party to exchange ideas...

727
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:40,294
...throughout sessions
of the National Front of Iran.

728
01:08:41,071 --> 01:08:46,790
I don't mean some routine and useless
sessions in which people with...

729
01:08:46,815 --> 01:08:52,370
...the same attires and ideas only
play the role of exchanging ideas.

730
01:08:53,152 --> 01:08:55,027
Please come for lunch, sirs.

731
01:08:55,052 --> 01:08:56,902
Put some at the other side too.

732
01:09:00,598 --> 01:09:03,845
Please come for lunch to have a
balance in the congregation, Taleqani.

733
01:09:04,086 --> 01:09:07,202
This corner of the room is sinking for
having two precious figures sitting on.

734
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:09,648
- Please!
- You go and we'll join you.

735
01:09:09,673 --> 01:09:10,467
Sure.

736
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:14,665
Thanks for the ring.
May God accept your pilgrimage!

737
01:09:14,929 --> 01:09:16,608
Don't mention it.
Thank you indeed.

738
01:09:16,866 --> 01:09:18,145
You're welcome.

739
01:09:20,382 --> 01:09:21,094
Wow!

740
01:09:50,384 --> 01:09:54,167
- Thanks for my husband's job.
- You're welcome.

741
01:09:54,636 --> 01:09:57,212
May your father rest in peace!
Goodbye.

742
01:09:57,237 --> 01:09:58,236
Thanks.

743
01:10:05,289 --> 01:10:09,084
Running a business has got manners.
You must be able to compute.

744
01:10:10,127 --> 01:10:13,998
We're rather running up
a debt every month.

745
01:10:14,193 --> 01:10:15,907
Flowers are not possible to
be returned if they're not sold.

746
01:10:15,932 --> 01:10:17,011
- Hi Takhti.
- Hello.

747
01:10:17,036 --> 01:10:18,305
- Hi Hassan.
- Hello.

748
01:10:19,637 --> 01:10:21,876
- I've brought the camera.
- Thank you.

749
01:10:23,405 --> 01:10:27,549
You should look through here, adjust it
with this and press it to take the photo.

750
01:10:28,212 --> 01:10:29,611
- Have you put film in it?
- I have.

751
01:10:29,636 --> 01:10:30,769
These are my problems.

752
01:10:30,794 --> 01:10:34,273
Study these invoices and
count up the numbers once.

753
01:10:34,454 --> 01:10:35,365
Go ahead.

754
01:10:37,704 --> 01:10:41,627
You donate the petty money
which is left in such a mess.

755
01:10:42,025 --> 01:10:44,661
I also have a heart, Qolam Reza.
I do care for people.

756
01:10:44,796 --> 01:10:46,698
But is there an end
to people's poverty at all?

757
01:10:47,185 --> 01:10:51,584
We don't have to help out people
in such bad business conditions.

758
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:54,589
It's not a big deal to donate
while you've got everything.

759
01:10:54,614 --> 01:10:57,447
It's enjoyable when you need
something and give it to people.

760
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,185
Then say that I'm talking nonsense.
Hand me the invoices.

761
01:11:00,261 --> 01:11:03,140
Takhti, I've borrowed
this camera from my friend.

762
01:11:03,165 --> 01:11:05,407
- May I take a photo of you?
- Why just one?

763
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:06,868
You may take tens of them.
Where should I stand?

764
01:11:06,893 --> 01:11:09,529
Outside would be better, please.
- Let's go.

765
01:11:09,554 --> 01:11:11,064
- After you.
- Please.

766
01:11:12,764 --> 01:11:13,803
- Hi Takhti.
- Hello.

767
01:11:14,489 --> 01:11:17,538
Stand here, sir.
Right here!

768
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:23,782
Move away, sir.
I wanna take a photo of Takhti.

769
01:11:26,662 --> 01:11:27,742
Move away, sir.

770
01:11:28,596 --> 01:11:29,228
One!

771
01:11:30,984 --> 01:11:31,646
Two!

772
01:11:34,467 --> 01:11:35,140
Three!

773
01:11:37,879 --> 01:11:40,028
You've told Izadi you wouldn't attend
the anniversary of the coup d'etat.

774
01:11:40,053 --> 01:11:41,758
All the wrestling champions
are gonna attend it.

775
01:11:41,912 --> 01:11:43,904
Now it's time for you to be visible.
It's a pity to marginalize yourself,

776
01:11:43,929 --> 01:11:47,467
More than now for a few students
and that old man of Qajar dynasty.

777
01:11:48,049 --> 01:11:52,497
No offence, but it was a coup d'etat.
A coup d'etat is not to be celebrated.

778
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:55,879
If you wish to get more troubles, tell
me not to speak and watch the movie.

779
01:11:56,131 --> 01:12:00,871
- I have nothing to do with the others.
- You don't, but you take your mother...

780
01:12:00,896 --> 01:12:04,786
...to Mashhad when the Prime Minister
calls you in person to invite for dinner.

781
01:12:05,804 --> 01:12:07,323
You rejected the offer
of Tehran Municipality too.

782
01:12:07,348 --> 01:12:09,772
What's wrong with you?
You should've become...

783
01:12:09,797 --> 01:12:12,258
...the mayor of Tehran to serve people
if you're too concerned about them.

784
01:12:12,986 --> 01:12:15,636
There's no merit in a position that's
not given to someone through people.

785
01:12:15,661 --> 01:12:18,443
Besides, would I do something
I have no knowledge of?

786
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:22,273
Then put your mind at ease
by forgetting about Toledo.

787
01:12:23,242 --> 01:12:24,623
So, I'm not allowed to
participate in the competitions?

788
01:12:24,648 --> 01:12:27,535
You are allowed to participate,
but not to practice.

789
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,662
They're so angry with you
and have intimidated everyone...

790
01:12:29,687 --> 01:12:31,479
...to not dare to practice with you.

791
01:12:31,504 --> 01:12:33,163
You'll soon be out of the competitions
if you participate without practicing.

792
01:12:33,188 --> 01:12:34,835
And if you're out of the competitions,
you'll be disparaged.

793
01:12:36,166 --> 01:12:39,829
- I'm gonna practice on my own.
- You're stubborn, Qolam Reza.

794
01:12:40,368 --> 01:12:43,382
They've tried several times to stop
paying your salary but I didn't let them.

795
01:12:43,422 --> 01:12:45,061
I can't do anything else.

796
01:12:45,341 --> 01:12:48,746
They wanna put you under
pressure to be fed up with life.

797
01:12:50,357 --> 01:12:52,644
- Even more than now?
- Yeah, far more than now!

798
01:12:52,947 --> 01:12:54,181
Listen to me, boy.

799
01:12:54,517 --> 01:12:57,480
After the movie, we're gonna buy some
sweets and go to my friend's tonight.

800
01:12:57,505 --> 01:13:00,072
He's the Chief Secretary and a big shot.
Rest assured, I've made the condition...

801
01:13:00,097 --> 01:13:02,009
...of not having any journalists
and photographers present there.

802
01:13:02,123 --> 01:13:05,469
You'll hang out in there, have a short
talk to him and leave after dining.

803
01:13:06,337 --> 01:13:11,595
Isn't he the one who stabbed his soldiers
for not beating people in the coup d'etat?

804
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,205
You said you had
nothing to do with the others.

805
01:13:13,353 --> 01:13:16,546
Besides, years are past after those
days and even people have forgotten it.

806
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:19,734
People remember it very well
and won't accept me to do that.

807
01:13:19,846 --> 01:13:22,337
People don't have a good memory
and are not tough, Qolam Reza.

808
01:13:22,467 --> 01:13:24,388
Don't live for the
contentment of these people.

809
01:13:24,532 --> 01:13:26,033
If you gain a gold medal,
they'll like you.

810
01:13:26,058 --> 01:13:28,035
If you don't, they'll ask
you not to wrestle anymore.

811
01:13:28,205 --> 01:13:30,264
They'll shortly hate
and tell you to go to hell.

812
01:13:30,289 --> 01:13:31,858
Would you kill yourself then?

813
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:34,085
I'll be right back.

814
01:13:35,469 --> 01:13:38,596
Once you become the champion
by saying no and once you'll have...

815
01:13:38,621 --> 01:13:41,389
...your demand fulfilled by saying yes.
It's time to say yes for you.

816
01:13:42,562 --> 01:13:43,441
Be right back.

817
01:13:44,935 --> 01:13:45,774
Excuse me.

818
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,999
The peak of the jealousies
and troubles were exerted...

819
01:14:11,024 --> 01:14:12,799
...before the Toledo World
Wrestling Championships.

820
01:14:13,201 --> 01:14:16,013
It went as far as the point that
if someone practiced with Takhti,

821
01:14:16,038 --> 01:14:18,381
He had the windows
of his house broken at night.

822
01:14:18,976 --> 01:14:22,089
Nobody was allowed to speak
to Takhti during the training camp.

823
01:14:22,377 --> 01:14:24,186
He was totally
separated from the team.

824
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:28,937
Nobody was even allowed to coach
Takhti or dry his sweats on the mat.

825
01:14:29,424 --> 01:14:32,098
I had a lump in my throat while
making the report of his competitions.

826
01:14:32,563 --> 01:14:35,957
He was exhausted, unpracticed
and short of breath on the mat.

827
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:41,949
I felt cold to hear Medved's words at the
press conference after the final match.

828
01:14:41,974 --> 01:14:44,354
[World Wrestling Championships]
[US. Toledo. 1962]

829
01:14:55,131 --> 01:14:58,572
Despite his loneliness and not
practicing, Takhti never touched...

830
01:14:58,597 --> 01:15:01,983
...Medved's knee during the match
by realizing he had injured his knee.

831
01:15:02,148 --> 01:15:04,911
Medved was sorry to see
how they were behaving with...

832
01:15:04,936 --> 01:15:07,228
...a splendid and kind hearted
champion like Takhti.

833
01:15:07,663 --> 01:15:11,130
Takhti was supposed the Iran's
flag-bearer, but had to hand it over...

834
01:15:11,155 --> 01:15:15,105
in the very last moments
upon a command from Tehran.

835
01:15:17,483 --> 01:15:21,489
Takhti's closest friend carried the flag
instead of him as the first person of...

836
01:15:21,514 --> 01:15:25,447
...the squad while he was to object his
withdrawal from being the flag-bearer.

837
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,895
He was more disturbed to see that
his close friend had turned his back...

838
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,278
...on him only for the sake
of being the flag-bearer.

839
01:15:32,899 --> 01:15:36,872
I'd never seen Takhti too lonely,
dejected and worn out as those days.

840
01:15:37,037 --> 01:15:40,663
Takhti could never believe
the villainy of the real world.

841

Headline
[The Champ of continents left alone]

842
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:46,252
The American doctors diagnosed
him with testis cancer that day,

843
01:15:46,277 --> 01:15:48,139
And he had to be operated
as soon as possible.

844
01:15:48,581 --> 01:15:50,738
He accepted to interview
with me before the operation.

845
01:15:50,763 --> 01:15:53,837
I even recall that he asked me
to interview him for the first time.

846
01:15:54,544 --> 01:15:56,663
I don't know, how you do it, sir.

847
01:15:57,001 --> 01:16:00,429
If I were you, I would have
sought refuge somewhere so far.

848
01:16:00,542 --> 01:16:07,888
You're one of a kind, I'd at most be
one like you though it's impossible.

849
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,528
And you're being behaved like this!

850
01:16:09,911 --> 01:16:15,526
Your bestie was made to take the flag
from you and parade instead of you.

851
01:16:15,683 --> 01:16:18,453
This is just one example
They've annoyed you too much.

852
01:16:18,666 --> 01:16:21,871
Our country is full of
betrayals and jealousies, Takhti.

853
01:16:22,168 --> 01:16:26,025
I'm trying to seek refuge in the US or
anywhere else if it won't work for the US.

854
01:16:26,214 --> 01:16:28,653
I know that I'll feel better
if I live anywhere except Iran.

855
01:16:30,324 --> 01:16:33,123
When I was 8-9 years old, a friend
pushed me in the dirt water as...

856
01:16:33,148 --> 01:16:35,784
...I had knocked him out in wrestling.
I would've been six feet under,

857
01:16:36,903 --> 01:16:39,921
...if my mother had come
for me just a few minutes later.

858
01:16:41,871 --> 01:16:45,984
You have your life because of your
parents, no matter if it's good or bad.

859
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:52,127
Your country is like your parents too.
You can't let go of it.

860
01:16:53,517 --> 01:16:56,990
Even if our country is in bad
conditions, we need to stay and fix it.

861
01:16:58,451 --> 01:17:00,295
Everyone as much as
he can afford.

862
01:17:01,459 --> 01:17:06,370
If you're sick of your country,
leaving it can't make you feel better.

863
01:17:08,489 --> 01:17:10,000
If you seek to feel better...

864
01:17:19,821 --> 01:17:22,461
- May I?
- Go ahead.

865
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:27,263
I'm with the world champion,
Qolam Reza Takhti.

866
01:17:27,288 --> 01:17:30,606
He fulfilled the Toledo
World Wrestling Championships and...

867
01:17:30,631 --> 01:17:35,832
gained a silver medal for Iran
despite sickness and unbearable pain.

868
01:17:35,857 --> 01:17:41,056
Now, he is getting prepared for an
operation in a hospital in Toledo, US.

869
01:17:41,261 --> 01:17:45,376
You went through a lot in this
tournament all of which I witnessed.

870
01:17:45,471 --> 01:17:48,812
What would you like to say to
the Iranians at the right moment?

871
01:17:50,045 --> 01:17:51,909
I feel so exhausted,
both physically and mentally.

872
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:58,252
Wrestling is over for me
I bid farewell to wrestling forever.

873
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:05,846
Would you please repeat it again?

874
01:18:07,212 --> 01:18:11,007
I ask people to forgive me.
I wasn't a good offspring to them.

875
01:18:11,475 --> 01:18:14,460
I've been struggling against everything
since I've got to know myself.

876
01:18:15,934 --> 01:18:19,704
I can't afford to do it anymore.
I bid farewell to wrestling forever.

877
01:18:21,634 --> 01:18:24,291
He stood lower off the
first rank after long in Toledo.

878
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:27,233
People came to the airport to welcome
him more than any other time,

879
01:18:27,258 --> 01:18:28,593
When he was defeated.

880
01:18:29,404 --> 01:18:32,518
They'd got banners which said
"Smile so that Takhti won't cry"

881
01:18:33,519 --> 01:18:36,893
People's welcoming was the
greatest welcoming for a champion,

882
01:18:36,918 --> 01:18:38,891
who is bid farewell to wrestling.

883
01:18:39,246 --> 01:18:42,981
People proved they loved the world
champion not just the color of his medal.

884
01:18:43,348 --> 01:18:46,756
It was proved again in the
course of Buin Zahra earthquake.

885
01:18:46,978 --> 01:18:51,432
There was an earthquake
in a large area in zero hours...

886
01:18:51,457 --> 01:18:55,944
...of September 2, 1962 which took
the lives of 11 thousand compatriots.

887
01:18:56,848 --> 01:18:59,126
Hundreds of villages around Saveh,
Qazvin and Hamadan were...

888
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:00,610
...completely razed to the ground.

889
01:19:01,238 --> 01:19:03,149
There was nothing left
but the wreckage as well as...

890
01:19:03,174 --> 01:19:05,604
...the smell of death, famine
and bewilderment of the survivors.

891
01:19:07,626 --> 01:19:11,033
Qolam Reza Takhti went on streets to
help the survivors being backed with...

892
01:19:11,058 --> 01:19:12,853
...no advertizing and aid.

893
01:19:14,508 --> 01:19:18,061
People who didn't trust that their
donations would be received by the...

894
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:21,554
...earthquake victims, donated all their
belongings due to their trust in Takhti.

895
01:19:22,329 --> 01:19:26,748
Their elder brother had asked them
for help this time, but not for himself.

896
01:19:27,670 --> 01:19:32,432
Now that Takhti would gain no more
medals for people, he'd been united...

897
01:19:32,457 --> 01:19:36,461
...with them more and it'd concerned
his enemies more than before.

898
01:19:36,931 --> 01:19:42,554
Takhti forgave those who'd done him
the worst things and held no grudge.

899
01:19:43,786 --> 01:19:47,719
There were many champions these
years who were popular in awhile.

900
01:19:47,744 --> 01:19:50,517
But people's relationship
with Takhti was strange.

901
01:19:50,982 --> 01:19:54,643
People felt his deep simplicity
and purity of heart and soul.

902
01:19:55,368 --> 01:19:57,928
He took people's donations to
Buin Zahra in person and delivered...

903
01:19:57,953 --> 01:19:59,350
...them to the earthquake victims.

904
01:19:59,611 --> 01:20:02,331
He paid regular visits to the place till
the houses and schools were built,

905
01:20:02,356 --> 01:20:03,916
with the donated money.

906
01:20:04,727 --> 01:20:07,647
People saw that Takhti didn't
sell himself out for anything.

907
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:11,536
Even in the peak of his financial issues
when he was offered to play a role in...

908
01:20:11,561 --> 01:20:14,170
...a movie with the multiple
payment of superstars, he said:

909
01:20:14,491 --> 01:20:17,486
"I won't accept it as people
shouldn't pay money to see me."

910
01:20:17,617 --> 01:20:19,837
"I'm amidst people
whenever they wish to see me."

911
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:23,598
That was why he was
endeared by people day by day.

912
01:20:58,398 --> 01:21:00,698
I had no idea who to ask
for money for my wedding party.

913
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:03,090
Whoever I asked for
help made an exeuse.

914
01:21:03,417 --> 01:21:05,492
I just got the idea
of coming at your door.

915
01:21:06,395 --> 01:21:07,969
I asked people for your address.

916
01:21:08,338 --> 01:21:11,561
I thought there was
no shame to ask Trakhti for money.

917
01:21:12,248 --> 01:21:14,747
I'll give back my debt,
as soon as I earn some money.

918
01:21:15,168 --> 01:21:16,728
Ok, eat!
It's gonna get cold.

919
01:21:16,753 --> 01:21:18,748
I ate too much, thanks.
I can't eat more.

920
01:21:34,138 --> 01:21:36,274
It's a keepsake of the Olympic Games.
Have it fitted for your wedding party.

921
01:21:36,299 --> 01:21:39,125
- Thank you, it's enough.
- Take it, don't say anything.

922
01:21:39,150 --> 01:21:41,155
- Thank you so much.
- Congratulations.

923
01:21:42,178 --> 01:21:45,359
- I was embarrassed.
- Don't mention it.

924
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:52,091
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

925
01:21:52,116 --> 01:21:53,223
May God be with you.

926
01:21:54,931 --> 01:21:57,044
You wrote my phone number.
Give me a call if you need help.

927
01:21:57,069 --> 01:21:58,561
Sure.
Goodbye.

928
01:22:06,123 --> 01:22:06,868
Why are you on your feet?

929
01:22:07,913 --> 01:22:10,271
I'd come to tell you something, but
I was embarrassed when I saw you.

930
01:22:10,778 --> 01:22:12,941
Things were distracted
by coming of that soldier.

931
01:22:13,612 --> 01:22:14,201
What's up?

932
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:16,711
The letter of your appointment
for the position of coaching...

933
01:22:16,736 --> 01:22:18,150
...the National Team was issued
by the Wrestling Federation.

934
01:22:18,678 --> 01:22:21,455
It was supposed to be announced
to you this week, I saw the letter.

935
01:22:22,331 --> 01:22:25,677
Some guys came by today and
said you'd gone to Tehran University.

936
01:22:25,702 --> 01:22:29,357
You'd taken food and given a speech
for the students who'd been confined.

937
01:22:29,676 --> 01:22:31,515
The students had
shouted bad slogans.

938
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:33,443
Is taking food for
students considered a crime?

939
01:22:33,757 --> 01:22:34,614
Look, Qolam Reza!

940
01:22:36,216 --> 01:22:39,229
I'm still ashamed to look you
in the eye because of the flag issue.

941
01:22:40,638 --> 01:22:43,370
I just wanted to let you know of the
withdrawal of your coach appointment,

942
01:22:43,395 --> 01:22:46,695
before you'd realize it with a letter.
So you could make a move if possible

943
01:22:48,076 --> 01:22:49,792
The payment for your
Armlet is gonna be cut as well.

944
01:22:50,354 --> 01:22:54,723
- Sorry, I could do nothing.
- Why don't you eat?

945
01:22:56,011 --> 01:22:56,690
I'm sorry.

946
01:23:00,539 --> 01:23:02,846
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

947
01:23:20,082 --> 01:23:22,653
- Your guest left too soon.
- Yeah.

948
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:26,006
- Thank you.
- Bon appetit.

949
01:23:27,141 --> 01:23:29,309
Mother has not been talking
to nobody since this morning.

950
01:23:29,511 --> 01:23:31,924
She saw the magazine
with the photo of the girl on it.

951
01:23:32,099 --> 01:23:33,718
It said you'd attended
a gathering together.

952
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:37,981
You have a good taste.
She's got light eyes. Congrats!

953
01:23:38,322 --> 01:23:40,843
But figuree it out to
have mother annoyed less.

954
01:24:02,042 --> 01:24:04,307
I'm sorry, Takhti.
Please forgive me.

955
01:24:04,332 --> 01:24:05,395
It's not in my control.

956
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:07,683
I talked to them and they said
they had no control over it either.

957
01:24:07,749 --> 01:24:10,398
You're banned from
entering all the stadiums.

958
01:24:10,555 --> 01:24:14,279
Sergeant wanted to come
and tell you, but he was ashamed.

959
01:24:14,537 --> 01:24:18,464
- Didn't you ask why I was banned?
- They say you shouldn't enter.

960
01:24:18,766 --> 01:24:20,726
We've received the
command by the authorities.

961
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:22,817
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what to say.

962
01:24:23,904 --> 01:24:25,063
- Ok.
- I'm sorry.

963
01:24:51,417 --> 01:24:54,556
- Give me one of them.
- Which one do you want?

964
01:24:54,847 --> 01:24:57,364
- The large or the small one?
- The large one.

965
01:24:57,429 --> 01:25:00,647
- It's the size of the wall
- Thanks.

966
01:25:07,129 --> 01:25:09,975
- Who is he?
- He's come from another city.

967
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,294
His wife is heavily pregnant.
He saw me at the crossroad.

968
01:25:12,431 --> 01:25:13,387
How much does he need?

969
01:25:14,244 --> 01:25:16,768
Give me 50 bucks if you've got.
I'll pay it back to you.

970
01:25:19,154 --> 01:25:22,434
Do you have to listen to one's life history
as he greets you at the crossroad?

971
01:25:22,474 --> 01:25:24,449
- Here.
- Thanks.

972
01:25:24,908 --> 01:25:25,816
Thank you.

973
01:25:28,413 --> 01:25:31,732
- Here you go, sir.
- You're my big man.

974
01:25:34,501 --> 01:25:35,886
- Thank you.
- God bless you.

975
01:25:36,022 --> 01:25:37,190
Go ahead, ma'am.
Be careful.

976
01:25:38,163 --> 01:25:40,304
- God bless you!
- Thanks.

977
01:25:47,192 --> 01:25:48,271
As soon as I get some money...

978
01:25:48,296 --> 01:25:50,346
Is she the lady
you met in the gathering?

979
01:25:50,937 --> 01:25:54,256
- Yeah, she is.
- You'd not mentioned it was serious.

980
01:25:55,318 --> 01:25:58,767
- It says you're gonna get engaged.
- She is a simple girl.

981
01:25:58,792 --> 01:26:00,592
Is that all?
She's a simple girl?

982
01:26:00,747 --> 01:26:05,289
Your payments have been cut.
You have no job and money.

983
01:26:05,546 --> 01:26:07,586
You shouldn't go
for the simple girl now.

984
01:26:07,918 --> 01:26:10,517
Marry a rich girl who
could help you make progress.

985
01:26:11,137 --> 01:26:13,774
The girl has got infamous by magazines
and you tell me to leave her?

986
01:26:13,799 --> 01:26:17,105
Why infamous?
This is what the old ladies say.

987
01:26:17,828 --> 01:26:20,009
The photo of you and this lady
is on the magazine now,

988
01:26:20,034 --> 01:26:22,533
A football player and a
singer will be on it the next day.

989
01:26:22,558 --> 01:26:25,712
Everybody will forget
about the girl the day after.

990
01:26:26,273 --> 01:26:28,798
But I'll remember it.
Bye.

991
01:26:39,073 --> 01:26:41,152
Was your wedding party
as you wished?

992
01:26:43,398 --> 01:26:46,909
Was everything Ok?
About the meal and guests?

993
01:26:49,592 --> 01:26:54,906
Everything must match up in a wedding
party or the guests will have a bad time.

994
01:26:55,681 --> 01:26:56,994
Everything should be harmonized.

995
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:06,107
When you were a kid and you were
offended, you used to hide beneath...

996
01:27:06,132 --> 01:27:09,020
...my feet and cover
yourself with my chador.

997
01:27:13,476 --> 01:27:16,279
When your name was
first published in the papers,

998
01:27:16,304 --> 01:27:18,781
I felt like my Qolam Reza
was taken away from me.

999
01:27:21,216 --> 01:27:26,384
Go, it's not fair to keep your wife
waiting at the beginning of your life.

1000
01:27:28,636 --> 01:27:30,289
Wish you a happy life!

1001
01:27:31,816 --> 01:27:32,860
Go son.

1002
01:27:52,883 --> 01:27:53,614
Sorry.

1003
01:28:06,163 --> 01:28:08,556
Takhti had many problems
at home with his family.

1004
01:28:08,581 --> 01:28:11,468
But he didn't like anyone
to nose into his private life.

1005
01:28:12,206 --> 01:28:15,988
That's why I don't reveal many things
that I know about his private life.

1006
01:28:16,486 --> 01:28:18,655
His family issues is none
of the business of others.

1007
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:21,808
When the glacier lands of
Takhti's father were seized,

1008
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:24,552
Something broke in him
that was never fixed anymore.

1009
01:28:25,211 --> 01:28:27,147
Wrestling was like
a beloved to Takhti's.

1010
01:28:27,544 --> 01:28:29,853
A beloved that was
forcibly estranged from him.

1011
01:28:30,141 --> 01:28:33,879
He was not allowed to practice
or coach the National Team.

1012
01:28:33,904 --> 01:28:36,100
He wasn't even allowed
to watch wrestling.

1013
01:28:36,788 --> 01:28:40,035
All his payments were cut off.
Such restrictions along with...

1014
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:43,383
...the serious financial issues
gradually unsettled Qolam Reza.

1015
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:47,615
He gained more than 10 kilos in a year.
He spoke less.

1016
01:28:48,136 --> 01:28:51,611
His magical look and smile he
always had on his face got cold.

1017
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:57,809
I witnessed that everybody
did his best to devastate Takhti.

1018
01:29:09,591 --> 01:29:11,449
It must be at home.
I'm gonna fetch it.

1019
01:29:12,215 --> 01:29:14,065
What are you looking at?
Be gone!

1020
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:18,811
- Silence her.
- What do they want?

1021
01:29:18,836 --> 01:29:21,743
- What do you think they want?
- All we need is that they ruin our life.

1022
01:29:21,768 --> 01:29:24,047
They wanna wreck Qolam Reza,
but they can't afford to do that.

1023
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:25,679
They're disgracing me instead.

1024
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:28,949
Why would they just inspect me
from that bloody office?

1025
01:29:29,144 --> 01:29:31,319
- Where is it?
- I searched everywhere you asked.

1026
01:29:31,344 --> 01:29:33,558
What's this you've fetched?
I asked for the green suitcase.

1027
01:29:33,583 --> 01:29:35,838
- Is that green?
- He is right.

1028
01:29:35,913 --> 01:29:38,398
They're taking their anger
of Qolam Reza out on him.

1029
01:29:38,423 --> 01:29:42,306
- Take the baby back inside, Zahra.
- I swear that he'd never embezzle.

1030
01:29:42,392 --> 01:29:44,042
What's the meaning of embezzling?

1031
01:29:44,078 --> 01:29:46,183
He's taken money
from his office stealthily.

1032
01:29:46,208 --> 01:29:47,482
- Please don't say that.
- Oh, Imam Reza!

1033
01:29:47,507 --> 01:29:49,568
Would the cops let him go
if I don't say that?

1034
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:52,813
Why do you say it while knowing him?
He's set up.

1035
01:29:52,838 --> 01:29:55,228
I had been his sister
before you became his wife.

1036
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,718
I do know him then!

1037
01:29:59,653 --> 01:30:02,435
Don't come to see
what's coming to your brother!

1038
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:04,761
You're afraid to damage your
"World Champion" stance, don't you?

1039
01:30:04,786 --> 01:30:06,548
Hush!
Why do you pick on Qolam Reza?

1040
01:30:06,573 --> 01:30:08,868
- Move away from his door.
- He needs to drag all of us...

1041
01:30:08,893 --> 01:30:10,772
...down with himself
since he can't wrestle anymore.

1042
01:30:10,797 --> 01:30:12,926
You have everything
thanks to Qolam Reza.

1043
01:30:12,998 --> 01:30:15,319
Don't expect him to support you
now that you've broken the law.

1044
01:30:15,344 --> 01:30:17,517
He's reached to 500 kilos
and is hammering the stool!

1045
01:30:17,701 --> 01:30:21,084
Why do you keep sitting in this room
all the day without moving an inch?

1046
01:30:21,485 --> 01:30:24,191
Go after your life
and make it up to her.

1047
01:30:26,759 --> 01:30:28,712
OK, I'll go now.

1048
01:31:00,854 --> 01:31:04,304
Recently I jolt awake in the middle of
the night and it gives me palpitations.

1049
01:31:04,869 --> 01:31:07,582
Why would my life be in such
a mess while all you care is that...

1050
01:31:07,607 --> 01:31:10,989
...someone who's written
a letter to you is penniless...

1051
01:31:11,435 --> 01:31:13,976
...or the other one
in some city is jobless.

1052
01:31:14,498 --> 01:31:17,036
There's no problem
if my life is a total mess,

1053
01:31:17,261 --> 01:31:20,580
But those who come to you with
letters need to be in safe hands.

1054
01:31:21,648 --> 01:31:24,209
I can't do anything for people now.

1055
01:31:27,096 --> 01:31:32,142
You see. you heard none of
my words and still care about people.

1056
01:31:32,397 --> 01:31:34,652
Why did you get
married, Qolam Reza?

1057
01:31:34,916 --> 01:31:37,260
It's not good for
you to sweat it now.

1058
01:31:37,615 --> 01:31:40,113
OK, I won't.
Just tell me something.

1059
01:31:40,449 --> 01:31:44,488
Did we have to live with your mother
and sisters in a house which is small,

1060
01:31:44,513 --> 01:31:48,350
even for them, if we could afford
the rent of the house of Amir Abad?

1061
01:31:49,207 --> 01:31:53,931
It's obvious that there'll be resentments
when people nose into each other's life.

1062
01:31:55,836 --> 01:31:57,604
You keep dodging for no reason.

1063
01:31:57,876 --> 01:32:00,782
You just worry if you accept
the offer of becoming the mayor...

1064
01:32:00,807 --> 01:32:03,360
...people would say, "Takhti
changed by becoming the mayor".

1065
01:32:03,385 --> 01:32:05,686
Or that, "Takhti isn't the
previous humble person".

1066
01:32:06,584 --> 01:32:07,346
Let them say anything.

1067
01:32:07,873 --> 01:32:11,039
People won't grant you
medals for not changing at all.

1068
01:32:11,315 --> 01:32:13,017
When did I ask people for medals?

1069
01:32:19,363 --> 01:32:20,140
It's useless.

1070
01:32:21,996 --> 01:32:23,622
Talking to you is useless.

1071
01:32:29,215 --> 01:32:33,199
I can do nothing more, Qolam Reza.
You wanted to start the business of...

1072
01:32:33,224 --> 01:32:35,576
...flower to make some money, but
it turned to be a no account business.

1073
01:32:35,965 --> 01:32:39,582
You donated all you earned from the
garden and the greenhouse to the poor.

1074
01:32:41,162 --> 01:32:45,665
You don't accept the offers of big shots
to be able to get a license and cash it.

1075
01:32:46,897 --> 01:32:49,303
You have no money,
but go to the university,

1076
01:32:49,472 --> 01:32:52,631
And give a speech
for the students in such a mess.

1077
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:55,628
You don't get along with your wife.
It's over my head.

1078
01:32:55,752 --> 01:32:57,984
I don't like anyone
to speak about my family.

1079
01:32:58,765 --> 01:33:00,981
I'm suggesting something else.

1080
01:33:01,078 --> 01:33:04,035
Looks like nosing into people's
lives is so enjoyable in this country!

1081
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:06,627
Qolam let me tell my
last word at the first place.

1082
01:33:07,141 --> 01:33:11,500
The heavy weights and light weights
you've got around you, have surely...

1083
01:33:11,525 --> 01:33:15,300
...said yes a big shot stealthily
sometime if they're prosperous now.

1084
01:33:15,325 --> 01:33:19,931
Nobody has come to know about it,
neither the journalists nor people!

1085
01:33:20,698 --> 01:33:23,218
Nobody cares
about the yes that they said.

1086
01:33:23,243 --> 01:33:25,918
Everyone only cares
about their current position.

1087
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,739
Your life is the result
of saying no to everybody.

1088
01:33:28,764 --> 01:33:31,685
You've got no place on the wrestlirig
mat, at home or anywhere else.

1089
01:33:32,489 --> 01:33:36,583
What'll be the result of being honored
by people as the "World Champion"?

1090
01:33:37,695 --> 01:33:39,567
Will you earn a petty cash from it?

1091
01:33:41,042 --> 01:33:46,675
You've got just one choice, Qolam.
The one your friends did.

1092
01:33:47,216 --> 01:33:48,175
Am I wrong?

1093
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:51,100
I don't nose into my friend's lives
to see what they've done.

1094
01:33:52,442 --> 01:33:54,684
Do you know where your
troubles have their origins?

1095
01:33:55,319 --> 01:33:58,058
Above all, you should accept your
current position in life but you don't.

1096
01:33:59,024 --> 01:34:01,998
The papers have accused your family
of some nonsense many of which...

1097
01:34:02,023 --> 01:34:04,568
...are believed by people, no matter
if you turn a blind eye to them.

1098
01:34:05,448 --> 01:34:08,540
You must reconcile with your wife even
if it's faked for the photo of the papers.

1099
01:34:08,877 --> 01:34:12,071
Besides, you should make a deal
with a big shot to start a business.

1100
01:34:12,096 --> 01:34:14,728
I'll provide the market for it.
I'll have your back with everything.

1101
01:34:15,801 --> 01:34:18,135
I'll tell Ashraf to make some
turmeric rice on weekend,

1102
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:20,159
And you come over with your wife.

1103
01:34:21,157 --> 01:34:25,514
We'll start with the reconciliation and
evaluate the new business there.

1104
01:34:27,542 --> 01:34:28,323
I'll call you.

1105
01:34:41,143 --> 01:34:44,885
Hello mother.
Are you fine?

1106
01:34:46,388 --> 01:34:50,806
All the financial, mental, political and
family pressures for marginalizing...

1107
01:34:50,831 --> 01:34:54,806
Qolam Reza Takhti, changing
his political and social behavior or...

1108
01:34:54,831 --> 01:34:58,323
...fading his popularity among his
compatriots had an adverse effect.

1109
01:34:58,825 --> 01:35:01,786
Takhti lived the way he believed in
until the last moment.

1110
01:35:02,284 --> 01:35:06,381
He said no to all the offers
that didn't fit his beliefs.

1111
01:35:07,299 --> 01:35:09,372
Saying no was
the essence of Takhti's life,

1112
01:35:09,547 --> 01:35:13,132
In conditions that everybody
was competing for saying yes.

1113
01:35:14,024 --> 01:35:17,094
You know what bothers me more
than his debts and unemployment?

1114
01:35:17,644 --> 01:35:20,123
People for whom he kept
standing up are rebuking him,

1115
01:35:20,148 --> 01:35:24,357
Now that they've realized
he can do nothing anymore.

1116
01:35:26,807 --> 01:35:29,166
We've not spoken
a word for two weeks.

1117
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:32,528
Everybody kept busy
to realize how Takhti died.

1118
01:35:32,553 --> 01:35:36,958
They forgot that Takhti became Takhti
for the manner of his life not his death.

1119
01:35:38,008 --> 01:35:41,799
It seemed those who liked people to
forget Takhti made a big thing of the...

1120
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:45,322
...secret of his death so as to distance
people from the secret of his life.

1121
01:35:47,175 --> 01:35:49,492
You and father come over to speak.
I can't do it.

1122
01:35:50,771 --> 01:35:55,550
I think there's no secret.
Takhti was killed when he was living.

1123
01:35:56,096 --> 01:35:59,955
The regime, his friends, rivals and even
the people who allegedly loved him.

1124
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,734
So an unwritten agreement
led him to devastation.

1125
01:36:03,676 --> 01:36:06,968
Only because they
were far shorter than Takhti.

1126
01:36:17,030 --> 01:36:17,743
Hello!

1127
01:36:18,791 --> 01:36:20,588
Room No. 23.
Sure.

1128
01:36:22,156 --> 01:36:23,946
Luck is on your side.
He asked for some water.

1129
01:36:24,181 --> 01:36:24,774
Who?

1130
01:36:25,870 --> 01:36:30,320
Room No. 23, Mr Takhti.
He asked for a glass of water.

1131
01:36:33,966 --> 01:36:38,401
Now tell me how
you're gonna tell him.

1132
01:36:40,577 --> 01:36:42,765
That'd be nice
if I knew how to tell him.

1133
01:36:47,682 --> 01:36:52,572
Let's do something.
Suppose that I'm Takhti.

1134
01:36:52,911 --> 01:36:53,892
Stop laughing.

1135
01:36:55,315 --> 01:36:57,569
I just opened the door
and took the glass from you.

1136
01:36:57,954 --> 01:36:58,965
What are you gonna tell him?

1137
01:37:01,947 --> 01:37:03,226
I'll tell him...

1138
01:37:05,645 --> 01:37:11,884
Takhti, I've never seen my parents
and I have no seniors in my life.

1139
01:37:12,948 --> 01:37:16,514
Since my fiance's family
realized my relatives were nurses...

1140
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:20,145
...at the orphanage, they've chickened
out to proceed for our wedding.

1141
01:37:20,421 --> 01:37:26,140
I want you to do a favor and be
with me and Morteza as a senior,

1142
01:37:26,165 --> 01:37:32,204
In the matchmaking.
So that nobody turns us down.

1143
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:39,563
Takhti's solved thousands of problems
more complicated than this for people.

1144
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:43,735
It's not his first time.
Why do you panic?

1145
01:38:26,721 --> 01:38:28,190
- Hi.
- Hello.

1146
01:38:29,994 --> 01:38:32,316
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

1147
01:38:35,015 --> 01:38:38,800
I don't claim to know all the
secrets of Qolam Reza Takhti's life.

1148
01:38:39,015 --> 01:38:41,734
If someone claimed so,
do not trust him.

1149
01:38:42,735 --> 01:38:49,035
We all just try to connect the pieces
of his life to get a valid sketch in it.

1150
01:38:49,776 --> 01:38:53,540
But what is no more a secret is
that Takhti's companions,

1151
01:38:53,833 --> 01:38:58,361
Those who yearned for his
devastation gradually got old and died.

1152
01:38:59,027 --> 01:39:05,497
But Qolam Reza Takhti remained young
forever as he was only 37 when he died.

1153
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,000
"The End"
