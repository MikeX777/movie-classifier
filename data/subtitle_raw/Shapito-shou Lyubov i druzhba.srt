00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:18,607
Presents:

2
00:00:19,194 --> 00:00:21,291
A film by Sergey Loban

3
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,690
CHAPITEAU SHOW

4
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:06,851
Two worlds must never melt together...

5
00:01:07,238 --> 00:01:10,118
the real one and the fantasy world.

6
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:15,728
You now have to decide
which one you prefer.

7
00:01:19,123 --> 00:01:19,859
Hey?

8
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,453
Hi.

9
00:01:22,454 --> 00:01:24,440
Hey. CyberAlien, your
voice sounds strange.

10
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:25,401
Yours too.

11
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:28,123
I sent you something. Did you receive it?
-Yes.

12
00:01:28,124 --> 00:01:31,382
Maybe you're surprised, but that's me.
-But it is not a photograph.

13
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:33,762
You promised a photo.

14
00:01:33,763 --> 00:01:37,838
A photograph never shows the essence of a person.
-And this is your essence?

15
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:39,752
This is how I see myself.

16
00:01:39,753 --> 00:01:43,029
But it is not fair, because I
sent you a real photo.

17
00:01:43,693 --> 00:01:46,095
Sorry.

18
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:49,316
It is not surprising that I want
to see who I am talking to.

19
00:01:49,395 --> 00:01:51,573
I look even worse
than you think.

20
00:01:51,574 --> 00:01:54,454
LOVE

21
00:01:57,211 --> 00:02:00,539
...but there is someone who
knows how to change that.

22
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:03,775
Here is producer Sergey Popov.

23
00:02:04,804 --> 00:02:08,464
Sometimes a copy is more
valuable than the original.

24
00:02:08,808 --> 00:02:11,658
For example, look at the pre-Raphaelites.

25
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:15,292
In the beginning they were considered
cheap imitators of Raphael.

26
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:20,177
Today their work hangs
in the biggest museums.

27
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:21,588
Hey.

28
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:23,510
Did I hurt you?
-No.

29
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:26,391
You were suddenly offline.
I emailed you but you did not answer.

30
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:29,691
They took my modem away.

31
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,120
My mother thinks I am
an internet addict.

32
00:02:37,062 --> 00:02:40,216
I can not go online anymore.
Probably never again.

33
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:43,754
What should we do now?
-I do not know.

34
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:47,087
Maybe we should give it a try.

35
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:49,843
That would destroy everything.
-Why? No.

36
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:51,092
That's how it always goes.

37
00:02:51,093 --> 00:02:53,623
But we are still talking to each other.
Why can't we meet each other?

38
00:02:53,624 --> 00:02:55,257
Nothing good will come of it.
-But why?

39
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,210
I told you that before.

40
00:02:57,211 --> 00:03:00,338
But if you want to do something stupid...

41
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:05,377
You're the only one I have.

42
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:10,279
Only you.

43
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:16,086
We never see ourselves
in the mirror.

44
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:20,186
This shell of a body is too tight for us.

45
00:03:20,211 --> 00:03:24,287
But that does not matter

46
00:03:24,312 --> 00:03:29,426
because we are numbers in the internet.

47
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:34,057
Nobody knows what will happen to us.

48
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:38,093
We are nowhere and do not
come to life anymore.

49
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:42,002
We are shadows awakened
by the morning light.

50
00:03:42,027 --> 00:03:44,907
We are like two numbers in the internet.

51
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:52,987
Everyone can end
up here, like me.

52
00:03:57,051 --> 00:04:01,185
How many gigabytes
do we get for love?

53
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,908
You are my dearest,
my faceless friend.

54
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:11,559
What if you disappear forever?

55
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:16,042
You will find new friends on the web.

56
00:04:16,495 --> 00:04:20,904
We are only two numbers in the internet.

57
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,750
These are just words on the screen.

58
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:28,697
Only words, but we are nowhere.

59
00:04:30,783 --> 00:04:33,663
We are only drops in the ocean.

60
00:04:34,498 --> 00:04:37,378
Just numbers in the interweb.

61
00:04:38,502 --> 00:04:41,383
Excuse me, are you a CyberAlien?
-What?

62
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:44,172
Are you a CyberAlien?

63
00:04:44,173 --> 00:04:47,053
Do I look like a CyberAlien?

64
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,970
This is for you.

65
00:05:04,002 --> 00:05:06,882
It is not my fault.

66
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:09,829
You never sent a photo.
Just your essence.

67
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:15,353
How could I know?
You look pretty normal.

68
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,999
Did you expect something abnormal?

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,880
No.

70
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:23,669
I've seen the guys you approached.

71
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,551
That said a lot.

72
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:30,523
I was just trying to find you.

73
00:05:30,654 --> 00:05:33,534
Have you been watching me for a while?
-Yes, for a while.

74
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,419
Listen, I thought...

75
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,745
That if you picked me out,
then it was worth meeting.

76
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:48,860
I am not afraid, not afraid.

77
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,076
Do you like this movie?

78
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:09,671
I do not know.
And you?

79
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:12,552
I can't look at it for some reason.

80
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:15,723
Shall we go?

81
00:06:52,982 --> 00:06:54,999
Are you disappointed?

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,880
Not really.

83
00:07:00,477 --> 00:07:03,675
Have you read Borges'
"The Garden of Forking Paths"?

84
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:06,593
No. What is that about?

85
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:10,649
Well, it's both a book
and a labyrinth.

86
00:07:11,144 --> 00:07:14,025
Where everything has all kinds of variants.

87
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:18,222
You should read it.

88
00:07:28,732 --> 00:07:31,229
Hey, where are you going so fast?

89
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,110
We have to hurry, the
sea is waiting for us.

90
00:07:36,387 --> 00:07:39,267
If you are tired we
can take a break.

91
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,080
Why are we even walking?

92
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:46,027
Can't we just stop
and wait for a lift?

93
00:07:46,895 --> 00:07:48,816
That way you get the feeling
that something is happening.

94
00:07:48,817 --> 00:07:51,848
We are moving, even though
we are not in a car.

95
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:55,605
That is an illusion.

96
00:08:06,596 --> 00:08:09,476
Can I ask you not to look?

97
00:08:14,732 --> 00:08:17,612
Come on, tell me a story.

98
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:21,971
What kind of story?

99
00:08:21,972 --> 00:08:24,852
Does not matter.
A joke, or you can sing a song.

100
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:34,847
Tell me, how did you meet?

101
00:08:38,438 --> 00:08:40,679
On the internet.

102
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,560
And you're not scared
to travel with him?

103
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:45,259
No way you're not scared!

104
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,359
Have you ever heard this story?

105
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:53,028
A maniac found victims online...

106
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:55,496
And then ate them.

107
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:59,673
Such things happen.

108
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:04,446
Look at him, he
looks scary anyway.

109
00:09:05,282 --> 00:09:06,659
I'm telling you...

110
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,509
He has the face of a predator.

111
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,361
And you look delicious.

112
00:09:12,362 --> 00:09:15,242
He's so hungry
he's salivating.

113
00:09:18,736 --> 00:09:22,132
Did you really have to tell a
total stranger how we met?

114
00:09:27,513 --> 00:09:29,019
I didn't mean it.

115
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,900
But you could have said something,
helped me with keeping conversation.

116
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,890
You've made it so that
I couldn't say anything.

117
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,990
I thought I would die of shame.

118
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:09,315
What are you thinking of?

119
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:19,342
I'm thinking...

120
00:10:19,665 --> 00:10:22,545
That I've never understood
the beauty of travel.

121
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,350
And that today hasn't
convinced me otherwise.

122
00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:41,542
I don't care about beauty.

123
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:51,375
You have to think about beauty...

124
00:10:54,326 --> 00:10:57,206
Otherwise travel is completely useless.

125
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:08,947
I think you can only do one at a time:
either travel or think about beauty.

126
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,890
CyberAlien, are you asleep?

127
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:39,939
Don't you think it's
a miracle that we met?

128
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,666
Certainly.

129
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,501
Mountains.

130
00:12:22,195 --> 00:12:25,075
Do you want a sip of water?

131
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:28,439
Can I ask you not to look?

132
00:12:41,191 --> 00:12:44,071
There is hot water twice a day.

133
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,956
From six to eight in the morning...

134
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:49,743
and from four to eight in the evening.

135
00:12:49,744 --> 00:12:52,624
Hey.

136
00:12:56,183 --> 00:12:59,469
Here is your room.
Careful not to break the beds.

137
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,623
Take a shower as long as
there is still hot water.

138
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,504
Do you want to go first?
-No.

139
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:18,251
Alright.

140
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:30,719
You know, as a child I thought I would
look like a princess when I grew up.

141
00:13:32,477 --> 00:13:35,639
But now that I am an adult, I do
not look like a princess at all.

142
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:39,699
For some reason it seems like I could still
grow a bit more and look like a princess.

143
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:43,286
But I know that soon I'll be all grown
and I'll look like my mom,

144
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:47,043
And that what's going on with me now
are the best years of my life.

145
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:50,382
Where is the shower?

146
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:56,904
No more hot water.
-Really? What a pity.

147
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,630
Do you want to take a walk?

148
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:08,067
You mean, you want to take a walk.

149
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:10,948
I do not know, I thought maybe you wanted to.

150
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:14,247
I don't want anything at all.

151
00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:14,826
I feel like I'm in a stomach...

152
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:17,580
where food is digested.

153
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:20,461
This is not a sea, this is gastric juice.

154
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,838
Why do you say such things?

155
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:29,719
Why? Look around you.

156
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,446
Why see the bad in everything?

157
00:15:36,578 --> 00:15:39,458
Why see anything at all?

158
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:51,870
Love that looks like a dream...

159
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:56,650
Sounds like a crystal.

160
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,036
With all my heart, I love you...

161
00:16:06,337 --> 00:16:09,217
Forever I stay...

162
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:24,647
Are you thirsty?
Or maybe we'll go eat something?

163
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,767
You mean, you want to eat?

164
00:16:27,768 --> 00:16:29,657
No.

165
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:32,508
I thought maybe you want something.

166
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:35,389
I don't want anything anymore.

167
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:09,153
You know, they say that online
people have no identity.

168
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:11,109
It is actually the opposite.

169
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,928
People have to distinguish themselves
in a certain way on the internet.

170
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:17,033
Here you just have to
look good, eat and have sex.

171
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,598
A victory of the human flesh.

172
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,713
I think people are enjoying their holiday.
There is nothing wrong with that.

173
00:17:22,738 --> 00:17:24,499
Do you like it?

174
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,453
I do not know.

175
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:28,984
Maybe you have complexes around it.

176
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:31,865
Otherwise you would not
even think about it.

177
00:18:01,115 --> 00:18:03,100
It is my first time in Crimea.

178
00:18:03,101 --> 00:18:05,952
But I am not impressed.

179
00:18:05,953 --> 00:18:09,504
Just another ugly place that I could
just ignore and never visit.

180
00:18:10,693 --> 00:18:13,574
Don't you have a new
impression of it?

181
00:18:13,641 --> 00:18:16,010
I am not looking for new impressions.

182
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,891
I think it is impossible
to find them.

183
00:18:20,175 --> 00:18:22,705
I'm looking for them,
and I believe in them.

184
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:25,586
Is that wrong?

185
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:04,574
Did you know that the establishment,
the aristocracy of this resort...

186
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:08,514
The most special, select group of people
chooses to eat here?

187
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:11,076
Really?
And why?

188
00:19:11,077 --> 00:19:13,957
Because the canteen service
is a great honor here.

189
00:19:20,656 --> 00:19:23,536
Here?

190
00:19:26,614 --> 00:19:29,494
Are you going to the Chapiteau tonight?
-Perhaps.

191
00:19:30,394 --> 00:19:32,187
You should go, it's legendary.

192
00:19:32,188 --> 00:19:35,068
Why is it so special?

193
00:19:35,903 --> 00:19:39,260
Woah. Are you two together?

194
00:19:40,965 --> 00:19:44,172
This is my friend, from LiveJournal.

195
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,419
What do you need that
magnifying glass for?

196
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:53,167
A scout can not do
without one, brother.

197
00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:56,052
Arseny.

198
00:19:56,053 --> 00:19:58,933
Alexei.

199
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,040
And what is your username,
Alexei, if it is not secret?

200
00:20:02,812 --> 00:20:05,692
CyberAlien.
-Very strange.

201
00:20:05,824 --> 00:20:08,577
And yours?

202
00:20:08,578 --> 00:20:10,756
I do not have an account.

203
00:20:10,757 --> 00:20:13,607
It would distract me from the revolution.

204
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:18,364
A scout must remain loyal
to the flag at all times.

205
00:20:19,437 --> 00:20:22,318
I have to go now.
Goodbye.

206
00:20:24,243 --> 00:20:27,123
Bon appetit, CyberAlien.

207
00:20:35,518 --> 00:20:38,814
He's my acquaintance. We have done
entrance exams together.

208
00:20:39,555 --> 00:20:42,436
I already figured out
that you know each other.

209
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:58,869
Why are you always so depressed?

210
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:02,488
Because I am depressed.

211
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,287
Do you think I should be happy?

212
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:14,149
No, of course not, but...

213
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,252
You could have tried it sometime.

214
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:22,126
You wanted a travel companion
and I offered myself.

215
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,872
You like it here, I do not.
What's the question?

216
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:30,520
Poor CyberAlien.

217
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:33,838
Why did I drag him here?
He must be suffering terribly.

218
00:21:34,045 --> 00:21:36,286
You do not know
what you are doing.

219
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:40,171
You are like a leper, you do not feel pain
if you touch something cold or hot.

220
00:21:40,196 --> 00:21:43,076
The fact that you do not feel guilty
does not mean that you are innocent.

221
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:45,959
It means that you are rotten inside.

222
00:21:50,607 --> 00:21:53,487
You are rotten yourself.

223
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,950
I'm going.

224
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:08,832
Goodbye.

225
00:22:24,274 --> 00:22:27,154
Lesha, stop.

226
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,168
Wait.

227
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:32,987
What?

228
00:22:32,988 --> 00:22:35,868
Please, explain why you're leaving.

229
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:39,552
I tried to explain,
but you just don't understand anything.

230
00:22:40,196 --> 00:22:43,076
I will understand.
Explain again.

231
00:22:43,302 --> 00:22:46,183
I will understand.

232
00:22:47,947 --> 00:22:50,827
Do not go away.

233
00:22:51,022 --> 00:22:53,712
I will never do it again.
-Stop humiliating yourself.

234
00:22:53,713 --> 00:22:56,115
No one needs that.

235
00:22:56,116 --> 00:22:57,621
Lesha, I need you.

236
00:22:57,622 --> 00:23:00,502
Stop. please.

237
00:23:09,987 --> 00:23:12,868
Please?

238
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,160
Alright then.

239
00:23:21,935 --> 00:23:24,657
We are like two stars.

240
00:23:24,658 --> 00:23:26,835
So far apart.

241
00:23:26,836 --> 00:23:30,637
From two sides of the globe,
I fly after you or you after me...

242
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,145
Alexandr, where are you?
-Just a minute...

243
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:37,735
Are we flying to our
happiness or sadness?

244
00:23:38,273 --> 00:23:41,767
We fly, dreamless.

245
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:45,235
I come after you. Will you come after me?

246
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:50,445
If you want me to, I'll leave.

247
00:23:50,446 --> 00:23:51,438
Where to?

248
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:54,129
I do not know,
just take a walk somewhere.

249
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:57,010
I don't care either way.

250
00:25:12,613 --> 00:25:16,208
Stand still. Come here.
Damn it.

251
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:19,882
You red chicken. Come on, asshole.

252
00:25:19,884 --> 00:25:21,582
You jerk.

253
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:24,463
Another one. Come on,
I'll kill you both.

254
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:34,522
I'll knock you rotten, stupid jerk.

255
00:25:38,144 --> 00:25:43,001
Stay still, bastards. I've been here
since 1987, do you hear that?

256
00:25:44,398 --> 00:25:45,524
Sunbathing.

257
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:29,558
Have you enjoyed your day?

258
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,128
Yes.

259
00:26:31,129 --> 00:26:33,915
Good for you.

260
00:26:33,916 --> 00:26:37,101
Thank you.
I hope you mean it.

261
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:55,247
Can I tell you a scary story?

262
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,850
I'm leaving.

263
00:27:08,576 --> 00:27:09,696
I'm leaving!

264
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:11,555
I heard you.

265
00:27:11,556 --> 00:27:14,436
Bye.

266
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,297
Would you like to
do me a big favor?

267
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:50,988
May I ask you to disappear
completely from my life?

268
00:27:50,989 --> 00:27:53,711
Don't write to me, never call me.

269
00:27:53,712 --> 00:27:56,466
I will do my best.

270
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:59,348
Then I'm going now.

271
00:28:06,526 --> 00:28:09,406
I want to take one more thing.

272
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:28,084
Are you on holiday here?

273
00:28:28,085 --> 00:28:30,006
Are you looking for accommodation?

274
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:34,530
I have a two-story villa right by the sea.
Just like in Hollywood.

275
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:36,861
On the beach? In the mountains?

276
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:39,584
Money, money?

277
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:42,680
2 and two zeros, that's it.

278
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,512
That's it yes, with zeros,
I can't make a discount, sorry.

279
00:28:46,536 --> 00:28:49,417
That really does not work.
Goodbye.

280
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:17,021
Sorry, did you see an old man...

281
00:30:18,762 --> 00:30:22,412
With a big camera and a monkey?

282
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:19,345
We'll buy a small duck.

283
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,068
Duck that goes ta-ta-ta-ta.

284
00:31:21,069 --> 00:31:23,949
A chicken that eats beans and
goes kudah-tah-tah.

285
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,465
We buy a turkey for grandma.

286
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:34,352
The turkey does foldy-boldey.
And the duckling ta-ta-ta-ta...

287
00:31:39,937 --> 00:31:42,755
Can I talk to you?

288
00:31:42,756 --> 00:31:43,747
Why?

289
00:31:43,748 --> 00:31:45,125
We have to talk.

290
00:31:45,126 --> 00:31:46,214
About what?

291
00:31:46,215 --> 00:31:49,095
About us.

292
00:32:02,393 --> 00:32:06,205
I wanted to tell you that you
are the most horrible person...

293
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:08,862
that I have ever encountered.

294
00:32:08,863 --> 00:32:11,893
How did I believe you?
I do not understand.

295
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:14,948
I lived a normal life.

296
00:32:14,949 --> 00:32:16,774
I did not need anything.

297
00:32:16,775 --> 00:32:19,655
Nothing.

298
00:32:20,203 --> 00:32:21,804
You started this game.

299
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:24,685
Can you tell me why?

300
00:32:24,688 --> 00:32:26,001
Just for fun?

301
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:28,851
To please your ego?

302
00:32:28,852 --> 00:32:30,293
I get it.

303
00:32:30,294 --> 00:32:33,936
You are the maniac that finds
her victims online.

304
00:32:34,106 --> 00:32:36,027
That is your true nature.

305
00:32:36,028 --> 00:32:36,956
You're a killer.

306
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:39,583
You have it all planned.
Bravo.

307
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,833
You played with me.

308
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,139
Played as if you were interested.

309
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,612
And I did not want to believe it.

310
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:47,493
I wanted to leave.
Why did you stop me?

311
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:51,498
To completely destroy me.
Was that it?

312
00:32:52,045 --> 00:32:55,224
You spun a web of filthy lies.

313
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:58,129
like an insect.

314
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:01,588
You're disgusting.

315
00:33:02,456 --> 00:33:05,683
You're a terrible, horny slut.

316
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,765
You are very funny.

317
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:11,647
Glad I could make you laugh.

318
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:17,170
I am a terrible horny slut and
I want to dance and have fun.

319
00:33:56,465 --> 00:33:59,345
Vera, are you okay?
Does it hurt?

320
00:34:14,628 --> 00:34:16,358
I was waiting for you.

321
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:18,407
I wanted to say that I'm sorry.

322
00:34:18,408 --> 00:34:21,259
I do not know what happened to me.

323
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,668
I'll get my things.

324
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:25,038
Are you going? -Yes.

325
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:27,920
With that guy?
-Doesn't matter. I'm just leaving.

326
00:34:28,852 --> 00:34:31,732
How can you say that
it does not matter?

327
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:34,647
I need to know.
-What?

328
00:34:41,985 --> 00:34:43,491
Are you with him now?

329
00:34:43,492 --> 00:34:46,372
No, not at all.

330
00:34:47,111 --> 00:34:49,545
Why are you so mean?

331
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:52,426
Why did you start this
if you do not need me?

332
00:34:52,461 --> 00:34:54,767
No idea.
Maybe I loved you.

333
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:57,648
You knew all my weaknesses.
-I did not know anything at all.

334
00:34:59,604 --> 00:35:01,461
And now I want to forget
everything as quickly as possible.

335
00:35:01,462 --> 00:35:02,518
You can not do that.

336
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:05,399
I can.
-Do not do it.

337
00:35:07,293 --> 00:35:10,173
Vera, try to understand me.

338
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,161
I understand you very well.

339
00:35:12,162 --> 00:35:15,042
I was completely confused.
I did not know what I was doing anymore.

340
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:21,705
I'm sorry I hurt you.

341
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,487
I picked you out of your world.

342
00:35:25,488 --> 00:35:28,368
I only thought about myself.
And you did not want anything at all.

343
00:35:32,311 --> 00:35:35,914
It's not true. I pretended. 
In reality I actually wanted it.

344
00:35:36,188 --> 00:35:39,068
I was afraid of being so
intimate with someone.

345
00:35:40,032 --> 00:35:42,753
We are too different.

346
00:35:42,754 --> 00:35:46,251
You get enough from your virtual
world but I need the real world.

347
00:35:53,678 --> 00:35:55,567
Do not go.

348
00:35:55,568 --> 00:35:58,448
Try to find your true self.

349
00:36:08,606 --> 00:36:11,486
Vera, do not leave.

350
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:16,548
I can not live without you.

351
00:36:36,732 --> 00:36:39,612
How scary!

352
00:37:11,168 --> 00:37:13,506
This is the end of the world.

353
00:37:13,507 --> 00:37:16,387
This is Armageddon.

354
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:21,034
This is impossible.

355
00:37:21,035 --> 00:37:23,915
A delirium, a nightmare.

356
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:27,697
Lord, do you hear me?

357
00:37:27,698 --> 00:37:30,578
Lord, save me.

358
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:35,032
I'm hideous,
I'm a dumbass,

359
00:37:35,033 --> 00:37:37,914
I can not live without you.

360
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:42,689
Stop, I say, stop.

361
00:37:46,086 --> 00:37:49,267
everything is wrong.

362
00:37:52,556 --> 00:37:56,095
You came back.

363
00:38:00,308 --> 00:38:03,879
If only I could stop time.

364
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,013
My girl, my darling girl.

365
00:38:10,014 --> 00:38:12,894
I love you so much.

366
00:38:14,884 --> 00:38:17,701
With all my heart.

367
00:38:17,702 --> 00:38:20,582
I beg you, come back.

368
00:38:21,515 --> 00:38:24,839
How can you be such a bitch.

369
00:38:25,231 --> 00:38:28,111
Such a terrible dirty whore.

370
00:38:29,203 --> 00:38:32,021
Don't you see how I suffocate.

371
00:38:32,022 --> 00:38:34,902
In this burning hell.

372
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:38,650
Stop, I say, stop.

373
00:38:42,657 --> 00:38:45,537
everything is so wrong.

374
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:55,116
You can come back.

375
00:38:56,976 --> 00:39:00,370
I beg the time to stop.

376
00:39:18,855 --> 00:39:21,735
Look at that.

377
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,394
Come here, quickly!

378
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:26,381
He is still alive.

379
00:39:27,793 --> 00:39:29,715
And he is heavy.

380
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:31,348
Lekha!

381
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:32,694
Sergey Mikhayilovich,
this is my friend Lekha!

382
00:39:32,695 --> 00:39:35,575
We used to work together
in the theatre in Moscow.

383
00:39:35,642 --> 00:39:38,522
Lekha, are you on vacation here?

384
00:39:39,197 --> 00:39:40,286
On holiday.

385
00:39:40,287 --> 00:39:42,720
I did not know you were here at all.

386
00:39:42,721 --> 00:39:45,347
I found a job here,
in a celebrity lookalike show.

387
00:39:45,348 --> 00:39:47,557
Cool, right?

388
00:39:47,558 --> 00:39:49,928
She was my soulmate.

389
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,523
You have to come to
The Chapiteau Show.

390
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:54,445
A legendary place.

391
00:39:54,446 --> 00:39:56,271
What are you mumbling?

392
00:39:56,272 --> 00:39:58,545
Let's lift him up, Sergey Mihayilovich.

393
00:39:58,546 --> 00:40:01,300
He is heavy.

394
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:03,350
Lekha, I'll be right back.

395
00:40:03,351 --> 00:40:06,231
And then you tell me what happened, okay?

396
00:40:07,195 --> 00:40:08,731
My life is over.

397
00:40:08,732 --> 00:40:11,070
What is the matter with you?

398
00:40:11,071 --> 00:40:13,951
Stay here, alright?
I'll be right back.

399
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:19,686
I have to get her back.

400
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:24,812
You see how strange fate can be?

401
00:41:24,813 --> 00:41:28,090
Here we are, just like in Moscow.

402
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,373
We were always the two of us there,
every day,

403
00:41:32,374 --> 00:41:34,358
And here as well.

404
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:37,239
Interesting, right?

405
00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:42,909
Nobody will ever understand
me as well as she did.

406
00:41:43,393 --> 00:41:46,115
Nobody in the whole world.

407
00:41:46,116 --> 00:41:48,996
A life without her does not make any sense.
You understand?

408
00:41:50,024 --> 00:41:52,905
Yes.

409
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:14,110
I have to go. You can
see me in the show.

410
00:45:01,172 --> 00:45:03,957
I was at the end of the world.

411
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:06,072
I was at the end of heaven.

412
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:08,953
I was at the end of the ocean.

413
00:45:09,852 --> 00:45:12,733
I climbed the highest mountain.

414
00:45:12,927 --> 00:45:19,235
I did not meet anyone who did
not want to be my friend.

415
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:34,676
My heart is full of sorrow.

416
00:45:35,064 --> 00:45:37,944
I know what pain is.

417
00:45:38,523 --> 00:45:41,403
My heart is filled with despair.

418
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,991
I know death.

419
00:45:45,538 --> 00:45:49,768
I have no one that I
can sing to in silence.

420
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,841
I want to be with you.

421
00:45:52,842 --> 00:45:55,722
My hands are like birds.

422
00:45:57,615 --> 00:46:00,496
Caught in the cage of my soul.

423
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:06,327
Mama, You understood
me without words.

424
00:46:09,563 --> 00:46:12,444
Mama, you knew it, even
without a confession.

425
00:46:16,387 --> 00:46:20,442
Mama, how little I knew you.

426
00:46:23,691 --> 00:46:26,571
Who understands me now?

427
00:46:27,022 --> 00:46:29,424
Will this world ever see spring?

428
00:46:29,425 --> 00:46:32,305
FRIENDSHIP

429
00:46:45,826 --> 00:46:48,003
What is that?

430
00:46:48,004 --> 00:46:51,335
A TV production. A program about the deaf.

431
00:46:53,547 --> 00:46:55,468
What kind of program?

432
00:46:55,469 --> 00:46:57,710
About the competition.
I won a competition.

433
00:46:57,711 --> 00:46:59,696
So the TV show is shooting
an item about it.

434
00:46:59,697 --> 00:47:02,577
Interesting.
Tell us more about it.

435
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:06,325
What kind of contest?

436
00:47:07,641 --> 00:47:10,300
What are they doing in our bakery?
They're disturbing us.

437
00:47:10,301 --> 00:47:13,181
Calm down.

438
00:47:16,995 --> 00:47:19,875
And who is that?
Another friend of yours?

439
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:24,136
I do not want them to film me.

440
00:47:29,488 --> 00:47:32,178
Do you think we are monkeys?

441
00:47:32,179 --> 00:47:33,171
Want them to film you?

442
00:47:33,172 --> 00:47:36,052
Go ahead, flail your arms, grab some bread.
We're not participating.

443
00:47:36,664 --> 00:47:39,544
Look at him, a real star.

444
00:47:42,879 --> 00:47:44,319
Hey.

445
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,510
You do not have to speak loudly
and annoy your surroundings here,

446
00:47:47,557 --> 00:47:51,588
What's important is to party, meet people,
be happy and light up the dance floor.

447
00:47:52,008 --> 00:47:55,699
A discotheque for the deaf. Is it for real?
Or simply a waste of your time?

448
00:47:55,949 --> 00:47:58,574
We're going to find that out.

449
00:47:58,575 --> 00:48:01,455
Hey, red!

450
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:05,257
How do you meet girls in this disco?

451
00:48:05,847 --> 00:48:06,871
Never mind.

452
00:48:06,872 --> 00:48:09,752
I must first learn their language.

453
00:48:10,589 --> 00:48:11,997
Look at him.

454
00:48:11,998 --> 00:48:14,878
Hey you there.

455
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:18,370
Who taught you
to dance like that?

456
00:48:19,269 --> 00:48:23,212
I don't think many hearing people
could dance like these guys.

457
00:48:23,594 --> 00:48:26,444
And now we are looking for our hero.

458
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,886
I am not a monkey.

459
00:48:27,887 --> 00:48:30,736
What are you?

460
00:48:30,737 --> 00:48:33,618
Do you only want people to be
interested in you because you're deaf?

461
00:48:34,133 --> 00:48:36,631
No.

462
00:48:36,632 --> 00:48:39,512
Every 6 months
a reporter appears here...

463
00:48:40,028 --> 00:48:42,908
They simply must shoot our disco.

464
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,997
What a scoop. Deaf dancers.

465
00:48:48,581 --> 00:48:51,142
What bullshit.

466
00:48:51,143 --> 00:48:54,024
It is not a zoo here.

467
00:48:54,091 --> 00:48:56,909
Go, tell them to leave.

468
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:59,790
Don't tell me what to do.
You think you're the smartest?

469
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,546
I decide for myself.

470
00:49:02,547 --> 00:49:05,333
Make sure they leave.

471
00:49:05,334 --> 00:49:06,454
Or you are no longer our friend.

472
00:49:06,455 --> 00:49:09,336
How long can we
steep in our own sop?

473
00:49:10,235 --> 00:49:11,612
You have rotted completely.

474
00:49:11,613 --> 00:49:14,493
When did you last
speak to an outsider?

475
00:49:15,649 --> 00:49:16,577
I do not need that.

476
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,019
You're just scared.

477
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,748
Blah blah.

478
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:22,907
You roll around in your deafness.
God forbid anyone jokes about it.

479
00:49:23,689 --> 00:49:25,611
You have broken our rules.

480
00:49:25,611 --> 00:49:27,437
I'm done with your rules.

481
00:49:27,438 --> 00:49:29,840
And who are you?

482
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:32,338
I'm done with those rules of yours.

483
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:35,219
Enough.

484
00:49:39,611 --> 00:49:41,981
Go and kiss their ass.

485
00:49:41,981 --> 00:49:44,735
You no longer belong with us.

486
00:49:44,736 --> 00:49:47,616
Deaf and dumb monkey.

487
00:50:24,715 --> 00:50:27,595
If you come in too late,
you get a hammer on your head.

488
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:31,793
I have a deaf singer with me.
-Really?

489
00:50:31,794 --> 00:50:33,042
Yeah, here he is.

490
00:50:33,043 --> 00:50:35,923
Hello, I've heard a lot about you.
Does he understand what I'm saying?

491
00:50:36,343 --> 00:50:38,168
Of course, he can read lips.

492
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:41,049
I'd like to come see you sing.

493
00:50:41,661 --> 00:50:43,614
I also hope you can see me sing sometime.

494
00:50:43,614 --> 00:50:46,495
Come, I want to introduce you to someone.

495
00:50:51,335 --> 00:50:53,768
Everything okay, boys?

496
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:56,649
Sergey, this guy is a deaf singer.

497
00:50:56,674 --> 00:50:58,578
Should we add him to your clients?

498
00:50:58,603 --> 00:51:01,487
What a great idea, sit down.

499
00:51:01,618 --> 00:51:04,681
This is Kolyan, the soundman.
Sergey, the producer.

500
00:51:23,817 --> 00:51:25,546
Guys, listen.

501
00:51:25,547 --> 00:51:26,796
What is he saying?

502
00:51:26,797 --> 00:51:29,677
I quit.
I'll be gone tomorrow.

503
00:51:30,256 --> 00:51:33,136
I'm leaving. Bye.

504
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,257
He says he has resigned from work.

505
00:51:39,258 --> 00:51:42,138
He's leaving tomorrow.

506
00:51:42,941 --> 00:51:45,631
The management knows about it.

507
00:51:45,632 --> 00:51:47,746
Okay, great.

508
00:51:47,747 --> 00:51:50,627
Tell him we do not need him.

509
00:51:51,655 --> 00:51:54,535
Yeah, have a good trip.

510
00:51:55,467 --> 00:51:58,347
Where is he going, actually?

511
00:51:58,414 --> 00:52:01,294
Where are you going?

512
00:52:02,034 --> 00:52:04,914
To Crimea, to Simeiz.

513
00:52:08,473 --> 00:52:11,353
Where to?

514
00:52:14,399 --> 00:52:17,279
I see.

515
00:52:17,475 --> 00:52:20,355
Maybe they like him.

516
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,745
And that reporter...

517
00:52:24,746 --> 00:52:27,626
has probably fallen
in love with him.

518
00:52:28,205 --> 00:52:31,086
Who needs him?

519
00:52:31,473 --> 00:52:34,720
They like him, they don't,
fall in love, fall out of love...

520
00:52:35,093 --> 00:52:37,973
What does it matter?

521
00:52:40,442 --> 00:52:43,322
You're right.

522
00:52:48,195 --> 00:52:51,075
Do you remember our oath?

523
00:52:51,975 --> 00:52:54,855
Of course.

524
00:52:55,051 --> 00:52:57,931
We have sworn an oath, us four.
Do you remember that?

525
00:52:58,382 --> 00:53:01,262
Kind of...

526
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:04,433
What was it?

527
00:53:06,326 --> 00:53:08,696
That was a long time ago.

528
00:53:08,697 --> 00:53:11,291
It was our oath.
An oath is forever.

529
00:53:11,292 --> 00:53:14,172
Do you remember anything about it?

530
00:53:15,328 --> 00:53:18,208
My brain is not working well right now.
Too much beer. Sorry.

531
00:53:37,496 --> 00:53:40,218
Do you still remember our oath?

532
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:42,940
Which oath?

533
00:53:42,941 --> 00:53:45,150
Our oath.

534
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:47,745
How did that go?

535
00:53:47,746 --> 00:53:50,627
Oh, that oath.

536
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:53,800
We are...

537
00:53:53,801 --> 00:53:56,395
What we are.

538
00:53:56,396 --> 00:53:58,381
We are not second-class citizens.

539
00:53:58,382 --> 00:54:00,014
What else?

540
00:54:00,015 --> 00:54:02,895
I do not know.

541
00:54:12,093 --> 00:54:14,782
How did you become gay?

542
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:17,663
Or were you always like that?

543
00:54:19,492 --> 00:54:22,213
How did I become gay?

544
00:54:22,214 --> 00:54:25,095
No idea, actually.

545
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:28,330
I just thought it interested me.

546
00:54:29,038 --> 00:54:31,183
Interested?

547
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:33,874
Yes.

548
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:36,053
I do not know if I could ever do that.

549
00:54:36,054 --> 00:54:38,934
Maybe if my work would
require it one day.

550
00:54:43,646 --> 00:54:46,207
They all do it in Hollywood.

551
00:54:46,208 --> 00:54:49,088
All those dividing lines are so vague.

552
00:54:51,334 --> 00:54:54,214
If you like someone.

553
00:54:59,631 --> 00:55:02,000
Perhaps.

554
00:55:02,001 --> 00:55:04,881
But I'm not ready yet.

555
00:55:13,565 --> 00:55:16,445
Not yet.

556
00:55:43,261 --> 00:55:46,729
Nikolai. You look sad.
Have a beer.

557
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:54,824
The deaf-dumb language is a must
for people like him.

558
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:59,783
No, sign language for the deaf.
Dumb people don't have a language.

559
00:55:59,942 --> 00:56:01,542
That's why they're dumb.

560
00:56:03,154 --> 00:56:05,139
Okay, that sounds logical.

561
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:09,259
Do you also have indecent gestures?
To scold someone?

562
00:56:09,913 --> 00:56:10,873
Yes.

563
00:56:10,874 --> 00:56:13,754
How do you say 'anus'?

564
00:56:14,975 --> 00:56:17,855
Anus.

565
00:56:17,922 --> 00:56:20,802
You are an anus.

566
00:56:28,429 --> 00:56:31,309
His brain does not work that well.

567
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:36,050
Too many trips.

568
00:56:36,822 --> 00:56:39,063
The scout is not a scaredy-cat,
he is brave,

569
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:42,012
And because of that,
he has earned a sweet.

570
00:56:47,329 --> 00:56:48,289
Quiet there!

571
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:52,450
You only think of yourself,
we have a deaf boy here with us.

572
00:56:53,447 --> 00:56:55,368
A deaf boy?
-Yes.

573
00:56:55,369 --> 00:56:59,384
If you go on like this, I'll get up
and kick your ass.

574
00:57:07,414 --> 00:57:10,294
If you have friends,
never worry.

575
00:57:11,226 --> 00:57:14,107
We are happy to travel together.

576
00:57:14,589 --> 00:57:16,447
What are they singing?
-What?

577
00:57:16,448 --> 00:57:19,106
What are they singing?

578
00:57:19,107 --> 00:57:22,517
A song from the cartoon
"The Bremen Town Musicians".

579
00:57:22,759 --> 00:57:24,231
"The Troubadour Song".

580
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,672
Why aren't you singing?

581
00:57:25,673 --> 00:57:28,554
I can not sing.

582
00:57:28,556 --> 00:57:30,158
Do you want some sunflower seeds?
-No.

583
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:33,039
Yeah? Okay.

584
00:57:40,217 --> 00:57:42,362
Everyone here is one of us,
as usual.

585
00:57:42,363 --> 00:57:46,042
Karagodin is here, Yasha.
-Yasha? -Yes.

586
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,218
Divide between the rooms yourselves.

587
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:50,755
Here is another room.

588
00:57:50,756 --> 00:57:53,636
But be careful with the beds.

589
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:02,946
Kolya, which bed do you prefer?

590
00:58:04,178 --> 00:58:07,059
I do not care.

591
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,458
If you don't mind,
can we switch?

592
00:58:30,094 --> 00:58:33,468
Are you going to the beach?
-Of course.

593
00:58:34,291 --> 00:58:37,659
Guys, we are not going
to the beach yet.

594
00:58:38,775 --> 00:58:39,704
What did he say?

595
00:58:39,705 --> 00:58:41,882
That we are not going
to the beach yet.

596
00:58:41,883 --> 00:58:42,714
Why not?

597
00:58:42,715 --> 00:58:45,595
Senya, why can't we go to the beach?
I'm going.

598
00:58:45,759 --> 00:58:48,639
We are not going.

599
00:58:52,422 --> 00:58:55,302
What is going on?

600
00:58:56,042 --> 00:58:58,922
Guys, only nerds go first thing
to the beach.

601
00:58:59,341 --> 00:59:04,483
I want my platoon to be
ready for the water.

602
00:59:08,439 --> 00:59:10,296
One two.
-We are hungry.

603
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:12,314
Three four.
-We are starving.

604
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:14,204
Open the doors for us.

605
00:59:14,205 --> 00:59:16,062
Otherwise we eat the cook.

606
00:59:16,063 --> 00:59:19,221
At first, it seems like there's a lot
of people here, but it's not true.

607
00:59:19,586 --> 00:59:22,245
They just walk back and forth.

608
00:59:22,246 --> 00:59:25,126
Up, down...

609
00:59:31,023 --> 00:59:33,744
Platoon, line up in a row.

610
00:59:33,745 --> 00:59:37,649
When you greet an older person, check
whether you have closed the kitchen tap properly.

611
00:59:38,486 --> 00:59:41,366
Give 5 minutes of your
time to this musician.

612
00:59:41,434 --> 00:59:44,314
Guys, good to see you.

613
00:59:45,406 --> 00:59:46,623
This is my platoon.

614
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:50,048
A mobile explorer unit in the
name of the film and the theater.

615
00:59:52,101 --> 00:59:54,981
This is a karaoke cafe.
Just look in.

616
00:59:59,373 --> 01:00:02,253
This is so scary.

617
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:22,787
Have you ever worked as a pusher?
-What?

618
01:00:22,982 --> 01:00:25,544
A pusher. I know deaf people
work as pushers.

619
01:00:25,544 --> 01:00:26,793
Worked as who?

620
01:00:26,794 --> 01:00:28,715
A pusher. A drug dealer.

621
01:00:28,716 --> 01:00:31,118
Drugs?
-Yes.

622
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:32,719
Do you want to get high?

623
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,545
Something like that, yes.

624
01:00:34,546 --> 01:00:37,619
Guys, why are you so slow?
Avignon.

625
01:00:37,814 --> 01:00:40,694
Before you know it, you have
spent all your money on drugs.

626
01:00:40,793 --> 01:00:44,426
I've got a lot of money.
I can buy whatever I want.

627
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:48,737
Tell me, are deaf people drug dealers?

628
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,292
What is the matter with you?

629
01:00:52,293 --> 01:00:54,791
I'm just kidding.
Sometimes I am like that.

630
01:00:54,792 --> 01:00:56,969
It is difficult for a
deaf person to find work.

631
01:00:56,970 --> 01:01:00,453
That is why some people
end up in crime.

632
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,376
But I have little respect for them.
-Why?

633
01:01:03,377 --> 01:01:06,257
They have no willpower.

634
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:09,173
They do not really want to do their best.

635
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:11,641
You're right.

636
01:01:11,642 --> 01:01:15,338
Scouts, when we greet someone new,
remember that you have to work hard.

637
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:30,980
Look, gays.
-Be quiet.

638
01:01:31,242 --> 01:01:33,464
You'll freak them out.
They're in their nest.

639
01:01:34,028 --> 01:01:35,028
Don't.

640
01:01:38,006 --> 01:01:40,886
From what distance can you read lips?

641
01:01:41,913 --> 01:01:44,918
Can you tell me what
Julia is saying now?

642
01:01:49,282 --> 01:01:51,395
It's not nice to spy.

643
01:01:51,396 --> 01:01:54,607
Come on. I always spy.

644
01:01:57,129 --> 01:02:00,202
I can not really see it.
It is too far away.

645
01:02:13,435 --> 01:02:16,315
What is going on?
-Nothing.

646
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:18,848
Are you here with him or with me?

647
01:02:18,849 --> 01:02:19,777
With you.

648
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:21,923
Then why are you so clearly
with him now?

649
01:02:21,924 --> 01:02:22,884
Senya.

650
01:02:22,885 --> 01:02:23,845
What?

651
01:02:23,846 --> 01:02:25,959
I'm tired of explaining.
-What?

652
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,840
I'm tired of explaining.

653
01:02:30,189 --> 01:02:33,069
What is it with you?

654
01:03:11,192 --> 01:03:12,121
Come here.

655
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:13,017
What is this?

656
01:03:13,018 --> 01:03:14,971
That is pure ecstasy.

657
01:03:14,972 --> 01:03:16,830
Is it a drug?

658
01:03:16,831 --> 01:03:18,367
Of course.

659
01:03:18,368 --> 01:03:19,873
So you meant it.

660
01:03:19,874 --> 01:03:22,754
Really. Take it, I'll treat you.

661
01:03:23,173 --> 01:03:26,053
Guys, let's not take drugs.

662
01:03:28,491 --> 01:03:31,710
Senya, do you want to destroy your
life and that of your friends?

663
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:36,608
Now I know who he reminds me of.

664
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:38,196
He is exactly like Samantha Smith.

665
01:03:38,197 --> 01:03:42,223
Mr. Andropov, why do you want to destroy
my country and the rest of the world?

666
01:03:43,002 --> 01:03:46,215
Why? He is our saint.

667
01:04:10,167 --> 01:04:14,553
From now on our platoon
is called 'Samantha Smith'.

668
01:04:59,692 --> 01:05:02,572
Boys.

669
01:05:03,023 --> 01:05:04,431
Let's go to sleep.

670
01:05:04,432 --> 01:05:08,051
Boy scout, do not sleep and never eat.

671
01:05:26,729 --> 01:05:28,938
Are you sleeping?

672
01:05:28,939 --> 01:05:31,819
Yeah, god damn it,
we're sleeping.

673
01:05:35,281 --> 01:05:38,617
Guys, it's time for breakfast.

674
01:05:40,055 --> 01:05:42,935
Go away.

675
01:05:43,995 --> 01:05:46,169
It is time to go.
-We are in quarantine.

676
01:05:51,107 --> 01:05:53,987
Guys, wake up.

677
01:05:54,694 --> 01:05:57,288
Let's go.

678
01:05:57,289 --> 01:06:00,169
Time to get up.

679
01:06:02,126 --> 01:06:05,006
Can somebody take this deaf guy away?

680
01:06:05,055 --> 01:06:06,055
Somebody!

681
01:06:06,131 --> 01:06:09,011
The rooster has woken up a long time ago.

682
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:35,278
Guys, I feel sick
when I look at you.

683
01:08:00,428 --> 01:08:03,308
Kolya.

684
01:08:05,137 --> 01:08:09,397
Tell me, these guys,
Vasya and Jim...

685
01:08:10,935 --> 01:08:13,815
There is something between them, right?

686
01:08:16,188 --> 01:08:19,068
Yes.

687
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,576
So?

688
01:08:20,577 --> 01:08:23,457
Nothing, nothing.

689
01:08:24,325 --> 01:08:25,797
Are you also like that?

690
01:08:25,798 --> 01:08:28,679
Me? No.

691
01:08:38,035 --> 01:08:41,217
I do not get it. How can
you be friends with them?

692
01:08:43,257 --> 01:08:46,137
What's the problem?

693
01:08:46,428 --> 01:08:49,308
Well... they are gay.

694
01:08:50,977 --> 01:08:54,547
You are deaf, and they are gay.
What's bothering you?

695
01:08:55,975 --> 01:08:58,855
It's not the same.

696
01:09:06,674 --> 01:09:10,611
I do not know what to do with it.

697
01:09:12,472 --> 01:09:15,352
Should I marry him?

698
01:09:15,355 --> 01:09:17,340
If you do not love him,
you should not do it.

699
01:09:17,341 --> 01:09:20,221
How is that possible?

700
01:09:20,257 --> 01:09:23,518
He loves me and I'll leave him.

701
01:09:28,553 --> 01:09:31,433
I love him anyway.

702
01:09:32,686 --> 01:09:34,639
He's a good boy.

703
01:09:34,639 --> 01:09:36,208
Yes, Senya is a good boy.

704
01:09:36,209 --> 01:09:39,089
I just do not feel
enough for him.

705
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,174
Do you understand?

706
01:09:41,175 --> 01:09:44,055
I am not in love anymore.

707
01:09:46,236 --> 01:09:49,116
The fairytale is over.

708
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:53,633
Why am I so sad?

709
01:09:53,828 --> 01:09:56,486
If you want, I can
talk to Senya.

710
01:09:56,487 --> 01:09:59,367
Let's go to the beach already.

711
01:10:53,411 --> 01:10:56,292
I do not know what's going on.

712
01:10:57,031 --> 01:10:59,911
I am confused.

713
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:03,612
Please do not go away.

714
01:11:05,008 --> 01:11:08,572
I really need you.
As a friend.

715
01:11:09,749 --> 01:11:12,629
As a... I don't know what.

716
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:21,118
Shit.

717
01:11:38,515 --> 01:11:40,468
I'm not angry, north-north-west...

718
01:11:40,469 --> 01:11:45,554
with a southern wind, I see the
difference between a hawk and a handsaw.

719
01:12:11,182 --> 01:12:15,031
Hi. Jim is very burned,
I want to bring him this cream.

720
01:12:15,578 --> 01:12:18,458
Suffering is purifying.

721
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:49,980
Friends.

722
01:12:51,392 --> 01:12:54,868
I would like to make a toast
to friendship.

723
01:12:55,461 --> 01:12:57,542
I do not believe in love.

724
01:12:57,543 --> 01:13:00,424
Friendship is fairer than love.

725
01:13:00,715 --> 01:13:03,595
Friendship goes much deeper.

726
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:07,504
A friend is not just important
when you need money

727
01:13:08,371 --> 01:13:11,251
Or to ensure that you
do not get into a fight.

728
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:15,351
A friend protects
you from despair.

729
01:13:15,386 --> 01:13:18,846
A friend is your lifeboat
in a sea of misery.

730
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:51,811
What, god damn it?
Did you have your portrait signed?

731
01:13:53,602 --> 01:13:56,004
I want to introduce
you to this lady.

732
01:13:56,005 --> 01:13:58,567
This is Vera.
Vera, this is Lekha.

733
01:13:58,568 --> 01:14:01,448
What is it?
-So you can look after her nicely.

734
01:14:01,451 --> 01:14:04,045
I do not get it.

735
01:14:04,046 --> 01:14:06,384
You have to comfort her.

736
01:14:06,385 --> 01:14:08,081
Do you understand?
-You console her.

737
01:14:08,082 --> 01:14:10,962
And who will comfort me?

738
01:14:23,842 --> 01:14:25,252
Did something happen?

739
01:14:25,253 --> 01:14:28,133
There is nothing wrong.

740
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:01,319
Senya, come.
I'll take you to bed.

741
01:15:05,839 --> 01:15:08,881
You should not sleep at night.

742
01:15:09,043 --> 01:15:11,829
Stay away from me.

743
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:14,648
Where are you going?

744
01:15:14,649 --> 01:15:18,585
I want to dive from the Deva.
I want to establish a record.

745
01:15:20,127 --> 01:15:21,696
This will be a record.

746
01:15:21,696 --> 01:15:24,577
Do not, Senya.

747
01:15:26,085 --> 01:15:28,262
Where is Kolya?

748
01:15:28,263 --> 01:15:29,832
Where is our Kolya?

749
01:15:29,833 --> 01:15:31,882
Maybe he already jumped from the Deva?

750
01:15:31,883 --> 01:15:33,547
And then it will not be a record.

751
01:15:33,548 --> 01:15:34,605
What a pity.

752
01:15:34,605 --> 01:15:35,918
But I have to jump.

753
01:15:35,919 --> 01:15:37,616
I have always wanted to do that.

754
01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:39,538
Where is my trumpet?

755
01:15:39,539 --> 01:15:42,419
So Kolya is a hero,
and I am a soft-boiled egg. -No.

756
01:15:43,448 --> 01:15:44,311
Sorry.

757
01:15:44,312 --> 01:15:47,192
Where is my trumpet?
Where is my platoon?

758
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:51,788
We have lost our only platoon flag.

759
01:15:52,865 --> 01:15:55,203
The Samantha Smith platoon.

760
01:15:55,204 --> 01:15:56,901
Get Kolya, I want
to speak to him.

761
01:15:56,902 --> 01:15:57,925
Where is Kolya, I
have to talk to him.

762
01:15:57,926 --> 01:16:00,806
Where is Kolya, I
have to talk to him.

763
01:16:05,422 --> 01:16:06,863
Senya...

764
01:16:06,864 --> 01:16:09,745
My house floats on
summer, and I'm gone.

765
01:16:11,253 --> 01:16:14,133
Everything is simple in the summer.

766
01:16:15,289 --> 01:16:18,169
Everything is simple in the summer.

767
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:22,205
Stubble grows quietly
on my cheeks.

768
01:17:19,165 --> 01:17:22,903
Please hand it over.
It's mine.

769
01:17:47,643 --> 01:17:51,084
Young nature's friend, the
seeds are waiting for you

770
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,978
I do not understand your jokes.

771
01:17:54,979 --> 01:17:57,859
The Samantha Smith platoon is
ready for the morning exercise.

772
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:00,648
Platoon, our motto is:

773
01:18:00,649 --> 01:18:03,881
If you have dirt under your nails,
you are not a scout.

774
01:18:07,408 --> 01:18:08,913
You are dumbass yourself.

775
01:18:08,914 --> 01:18:12,028
Bad mood, the native Dead Ear?

776
01:18:12,053 --> 01:18:15,540
Come, then we smoke a peace pipe.

777
01:18:32,267 --> 01:18:35,147
Good job, boy.

778
01:18:37,136 --> 01:18:40,016
Let's go.
We are going to the beach.

779
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:45,270
A deaf and mute, native Dead Ear.

780
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:48,579
Just like in One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

781
01:18:50,013 --> 01:18:52,893
He needs a special approach.

782
01:18:53,633 --> 01:18:56,451
Did I misbehave last night?
-What?

783
01:18:56,452 --> 01:18:59,333
Did I misbehave last night?

784
01:19:00,296 --> 01:19:03,177
Honestly, I had to
carry you back all the way.

785
01:19:11,572 --> 01:19:14,453
Lesha.

786
01:19:15,961 --> 01:19:18,522
You go swimming,
I do not feel so good.

787
01:19:18,523 --> 01:19:21,403
Are we going back again?
I do not get it.

788
01:20:01,577 --> 01:20:04,645
Okay, we'll put the tent here.

789
01:20:04,877 --> 01:20:07,757
Isn't it too close to the sea?

790
01:20:07,952 --> 01:20:10,354
Maybe it's better up
there, with those bushes.

791
01:20:10,355 --> 01:20:13,456
We do not need bushes.
There's another tent here, see?

792
01:20:14,712 --> 01:20:17,592
So it's safe here.
This is the place.

793
01:20:23,745 --> 01:20:26,339
The tent is up.

794
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:29,093
Awesome.

795
01:20:29,094 --> 01:20:31,336
Now we have to make a campfire.

796
01:20:31,337 --> 01:20:34,217
Why do we need a campfire?
We are not in the forest.

797
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:39,217
A tribe always meets
around a campfire.

798
01:20:54,017 --> 01:20:56,897
GUYS, YOU'RE IN CRIMEA! I'M SO HAPPY!
LET'S MEET EACH OTHER.

799
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:07,372
Tell him he has a nice chick.

800
01:21:50,653 --> 01:21:53,534
We scared him.

801
01:22:13,205 --> 01:22:16,085
COME TO THE SIMEIZ CAFE FOR LUNCH,
I'LL WAIT AT 2 O'CLOCK.

802
01:22:19,932 --> 01:22:22,813
Let him wait as long as he wants.

803
01:22:24,417 --> 01:22:27,297
Damn, what's he thinking?

804
01:22:40,114 --> 01:22:44,124
Tell him we can not come
because Valera is snorkeling...

805
01:22:44,502 --> 01:22:46,359
And has caught a crab.

806
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:49,240
Stop saying stupid things.

807
01:22:51,421 --> 01:22:54,302
Who is that guy?

808
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:04,831
Znamensky has sent an SMS again.
He wants to meet us.

809
01:23:08,496 --> 01:23:09,488
And are we going?

810
01:23:09,489 --> 01:23:10,481
Where to?

811
01:23:10,481 --> 01:23:13,640
We need to fuck him up,
that was the deal.

812
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:16,023
I think he's in trouble.

813
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:18,904
Maybe we should just meet him.

814
01:23:19,163 --> 01:23:22,043
What do you mean by 'in trouble'?
What are you talking about?

815
01:23:23,968 --> 01:23:26,786
He can come and go as he likes?

816
01:23:26,787 --> 01:23:29,667
That is not going to happen.

817
01:23:29,702 --> 01:23:32,582
He will have to beg for it.

818
01:23:55,649 --> 01:23:58,244
Who is that guy?

819
01:23:58,244 --> 01:24:01,125
A tourist, he sleeps in that tent.

820
01:24:05,324 --> 01:24:07,982
What's he saying?

821
01:24:07,991 --> 01:24:10,117
He's saying that
he's the most horrible person.

822
01:24:10,864 --> 01:24:12,101
Who? This guy?

823
01:24:13,813 --> 01:24:17,265
BOYS, WILL YOU BE HERE SOON?
I SAVED YOU A PLACE.

824
01:24:30,695 --> 01:24:34,068
YOU WON'T HAVE A PLACE
IN OUR HEARTS ANYTIME SOON.

825
01:24:40,914 --> 01:24:44,629
I DON'T GET IT.
ARE YOU COMING OR NOT?

826
01:24:55,937 --> 01:24:59,442
YOU CAN'T COME TO THOSE WHO LEFT.

827
01:24:59,942 --> 01:25:03,203
I'LL COME TO YOU.
WHERE CAN I FIND YOU?

828
01:25:10,642 --> 01:25:14,107
YOU WILL FIND US BEYOND THE
BORDER OF YOUR DESPERATION.

829
01:25:41,266 --> 01:25:44,146
Who do we have there?

830
01:25:44,213 --> 01:25:48,271
It is Samantha Smith!
Let's greet her.

831
01:25:50,075 --> 01:25:52,445
What are you doing?

832
01:25:52,446 --> 01:25:55,326
Stop.
I want to speak with you.

833
01:25:55,777 --> 01:25:58,435
Put me down, quietly.

834
01:25:58,436 --> 01:26:01,898
I want to say that you are the
most terrible people on earth.

835
01:26:02,312 --> 01:26:04,490
I do not understand
why I believed you.

836
01:26:04,491 --> 01:26:07,277
I have lost my friends because of you.

837
01:26:07,278 --> 01:26:09,230
Why did you drag me here?

838
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:10,352
You are just having fun.

839
01:26:10,353 --> 01:26:13,233
And I'm a deaf little monkey, right?

840
01:26:13,588 --> 01:26:15,957
I had a normal life.

841
01:26:15,958 --> 01:26:18,839
I can not hear you.

842
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:22,555
Do you even care about who I am?

843
01:26:22,654 --> 01:26:24,639
If a rich guy gives you some drugs...

844
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:27,233
You kiss his ass.
That's it.

845
01:26:27,234 --> 01:26:28,451
I understand.
You are werewolves.

846
01:26:28,452 --> 01:26:31,616
You pretend to be good.
But inside you are rotten.

847
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:35,687
You don't even love anyone.
You just fuck, fuck, just fuck.

848
01:26:36,044 --> 01:26:38,924
It does not matter
whether it is a man or a woman.

849
01:26:39,004 --> 01:26:40,528
Who is in your bed.

850
01:26:40,559 --> 01:26:43,475
You are spinning a
web of filthy lies.

851
01:26:43,476 --> 01:26:44,629
Like insects.

852
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:46,422
You are immoral,
lying bastards.

853
01:26:46,423 --> 01:26:49,303
Filthy homos, do you hear me?

854
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:56,666
I did not hear anything,
but it looked very cool, applause.

855
01:26:57,059 --> 01:27:00,301
I am glad that the monkey
has entertained you.

856
01:28:07,149 --> 01:28:10,029
Senya, open up.

857
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:19,671
Senya, open up.
-What do you want?

858
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:22,845
Can she sleep here in my place?

859
01:28:22,846 --> 01:28:26,396
My friends are here and
I'm going to them.

860
01:28:26,594 --> 01:28:28,259
Good.

861
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:30,244
Then I'll take my stuff.

862
01:28:30,245 --> 01:28:31,878
What stuff?

863
01:28:31,879 --> 01:28:34,759
My bag.

864
01:28:35,210 --> 01:28:38,091
But you do not have a bag at all.
-What?

865
01:28:38,093 --> 01:28:40,974
You do not have a bag.
It has been confiscated.

866
01:28:41,575 --> 01:28:42,962
I do not get it.

867
01:28:42,963 --> 01:28:45,365
Dead Ear, I calculated it.

868
01:28:45,366 --> 01:28:49,415
You owe me money.
Your card, the room, the weed.

869
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:53,872
After the disabled discount,
you owe me 500 bucks.

870
01:28:56,930 --> 01:28:59,810
How much?
-500.

871
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:01,830
I do not have that much money.

872
01:29:01,831 --> 01:29:04,711
I can not do anything about that.

873
01:29:04,906 --> 01:29:07,786
Ask your friends.

874
01:29:11,024 --> 01:29:13,905
You are such an asshole.

875
01:29:16,567 --> 01:29:19,447
Open up.
-You know what?

876
01:29:20,378 --> 01:29:25,600
If someone spits into my soul,
I will never forgive that.

877
01:29:28,804 --> 01:29:31,684
Come on, open up.

878
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:22,073
I am like a satellite without a job.

879
01:30:22,684 --> 01:30:25,851
I am alone, my heart is broken.

880
01:30:26,721 --> 01:30:30,117
In my world a tsunami is raging.

881
01:30:30,661 --> 01:30:33,542
Kilometers of desert between us.

882
01:30:34,602 --> 01:30:37,689
My ship has gone.

883
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:41,992
I want to tell you how bad I feel.

884
01:30:42,738 --> 01:30:46,190
I burn, and in a thousand years

885
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:50,087
I will bring my last farewell.

886
01:30:50,939 --> 01:30:52,892
It feels cold without winter.

887
01:30:52,893 --> 01:30:55,455
As empty as after a plague.

888
01:30:55,456 --> 01:30:57,409
And I still live.

889
01:30:57,410 --> 01:30:59,523
But I am alone.

890
01:30:59,524 --> 01:31:01,317
It feels cold without winter.

891
01:31:01,318 --> 01:31:03,400
As empty as after a plague.

892
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,353
And I still live.

893
01:31:05,354 --> 01:31:08,234
But I am alone.

894
01:31:22,524 --> 01:31:25,404
This mold of inauthenticity.

895
01:31:26,785 --> 01:31:29,995
How was it again to
belong together?

896
01:31:30,757 --> 01:31:34,209
Where did our common goal go?

897
01:31:34,761 --> 01:31:37,641
I fell asleep like a boring movie.

898
01:31:38,734 --> 01:31:41,232
It feels cold without winter.

899
01:31:41,233 --> 01:31:43,473
As empty as after a plague.

900
01:31:43,474 --> 01:31:45,268
And I still live.

901
01:31:45,269 --> 01:31:48,149
But I am alone.

902
01:32:35,146 --> 01:32:38,026
Did they call you deaf and dumb?

903
01:32:40,975 --> 01:32:43,855
Yes.

904
01:33:04,392 --> 01:33:07,272
The bad news came unexpectedly.

905
01:33:07,468 --> 01:33:10,348
Here is a text message
Dead Ear's friends.

906
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,881
We are what we are.
We are not second class.

907
01:33:12,882 --> 01:33:16,523
Those who think they're better
are our enemies. Signed: The Silent Tribe.

908
01:33:16,950 --> 01:33:19,319
Who are they?

909
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:22,713
Today, on the holy anniversary
of Samantha Smith's death

910
01:33:22,812 --> 01:33:24,477
Germany has declared war on us.

911
01:33:24,478 --> 01:33:26,623
It is time to fight.

912
01:33:26,624 --> 01:33:28,802
We asked for it.

913
01:33:28,803 --> 01:33:31,043
We don't need this.
Just give that bag back.

914
01:33:31,044 --> 01:33:34,876
Do you think we are children
and just play games?

915
01:33:36,555 --> 01:33:38,860
Senya, leave those people alone.

916
01:33:38,861 --> 01:33:41,423
Soon they will throw acid in our faces

917
01:33:41,424 --> 01:33:42,704
Maybe they have a gas balloon.

918
01:33:42,705 --> 01:33:45,585
The fathers have left,
and the grandfathers have left.

919
01:33:45,716 --> 01:33:48,596
Senya, they are disabled,
leave them alone.

920
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:53,779
Do we, children of the revolution, have
to wait for that damn bourgeoisie...

921
01:33:53,914 --> 01:33:57,588
To come to fetch us and take us
to their bourgeois kingdom?

922
01:33:57,890 --> 01:34:02,009
We have to accept the challenge.

923
01:34:26,464 --> 01:34:28,994
One two.
-Stanley Kubrick.

924
01:34:28,995 --> 01:34:31,076
Three four.
-David Lynch.

925
01:34:31,077 --> 01:34:33,863
Solondz, Gus van Sant, Polanski.

926
01:34:33,864 --> 01:34:36,744
Let them hear this battle cry!

927
01:34:40,654 --> 01:34:43,813
Platoon, greet this hero of the revolution.

928
01:34:43,890 --> 01:34:46,770
Hi, Serezha.
I am happy to see you.

929
01:34:46,773 --> 01:34:49,175
How are you?
-Fantastic.

930
01:34:49,176 --> 01:34:52,056
And the performance?
Where and when?

931
01:34:52,443 --> 01:34:53,147
In the Chapiteau.

932
01:34:53,148 --> 01:34:55,902
In the Chapiteau?
With Tsoi?

933
01:34:55,903 --> 01:34:56,799
With Tsoi.

934
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:00,196
Great, Serezha.
Congratulations.

935
01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:04,926
Senya, did you hear?
His Tsoi will perform in the Chapiteau.

936
01:35:06,378 --> 01:35:09,259
Serezha, should I help you?
-No.

937
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:12,624
Okay see you later.

938
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:15,187
One two.
-Elvis Presley.

939
01:35:15,188 --> 01:35:18,068
Three four.
-Victor Tsoi.

940
01:35:18,071 --> 01:35:20,408
Lennon, Kurt Cobain, Vysotsky.

941
01:35:20,409 --> 01:35:23,289
Michael Jackson, sing a song!

942
01:35:45,332 --> 01:35:50,008
My little naughty. My little dirty.
Small dirty pig.

943
01:35:53,629 --> 01:35:58,779
Dirtier than a chimney sweeper.
Look at yourself.

944
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:10,797
I think they will immediately
get the police.

945
01:36:10,798 --> 01:36:13,679
Do not worry.

946
01:36:14,386 --> 01:36:19,076
If I stomp my feet...

947
01:36:22,843 --> 01:36:25,723
If I stomp my feet...

948
01:36:31,044 --> 01:36:34,723
I call my soldiers.

949
01:37:16,692 --> 01:37:19,447
This is so scary.

950
01:37:19,447 --> 01:37:20,631
Friend, here I am.

951
01:37:20,632 --> 01:37:24,005
Give me your hand.
Let's go.

952
01:38:00,963 --> 01:38:03,844
Do you love me?

953
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:07,498
I do not think so.

954
01:38:07,499 --> 01:38:09,900
I do not love you either.

955
01:38:09,901 --> 01:38:12,781
What can we do?

956
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,801
I do not know.

957
01:38:14,802 --> 01:38:17,682
I'm not sure either.

958
01:38:19,158 --> 01:38:21,657
Do you think this is normal?

959
01:38:21,657 --> 01:38:23,291
What?

960
01:38:23,291 --> 01:38:26,172
Us, here together.
Everything that happened.

961
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:30,592
I think so.
All kinds of things can happen.

962
01:38:31,844 --> 01:38:34,724
Well...

963
01:38:48,598 --> 01:38:54,018
Are you sleeping or do you hear that
I'm crying because you can not hear me?

964
01:38:56,223 --> 01:39:01,040
Do you think about how I cannot sleep
when I think about that?

965
01:39:03,814 --> 01:39:09,099
That we are so lonely and quiet
and just breathe softly.

966
01:39:11,535 --> 01:39:15,504
We are so lonely because we do
not know how to be together.

967
01:39:19,223 --> 01:39:24,370
Do you love me?
-What kind of answer do you want to hear?

968
01:39:26,878 --> 01:39:31,639
Do you love me?
-I do not love you either.

969
01:39:34,983 --> 01:39:39,260
We are almost strangers.
-We have been together for 100 years.

970
01:39:42,287 --> 01:39:46,594
We are everything
that we were born for.

971
01:39:49,911 --> 01:39:54,990
Do you love me?
-You are everything I've met here.

972
01:39:57,631 --> 01:40:01,641
Do you love me?
- No idea, but it is good that you exist.

973
01:40:05,992 --> 01:40:09,693
We are so similar.
- This is really stupid.

974
01:40:12,911 --> 01:40:16,776
We are everything
that we were born for.

975
01:40:20,119 --> 01:40:25,730
Are you asleep or can you hear that
I'm crying because you cannot hear me?
