1
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:39,501
Time don't march, or walk.

2
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:43,197
Or even move in a straight line.

3
00:00:44,137 --> 00:00:46,705
It skips around like a pinball.

4
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:52,301
Last year...
ten years ago...

5
00:00:53,517 --> 00:00:55,585
yesterday.

6
00:00:58,376 --> 00:00:59,790
It's all now.

7
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:28,719
Listen, that all was ten years ago.

8
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,511
I don't know what I can tell you now.

9
00:02:31,536 --> 00:02:34,571
Just anything at all
would be real helpful.

10
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:39,165
Well that sort of thing
never happened around here.

11
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:41,770
Uriah and the misses...

12
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:44,465
them bodies.

13
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,898
Hell, it was a god damn mess.

14
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,437
I didn't know the, the wife too well.

15
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,097
I knew Uriah though, he was
a decent man far as I knew.

16
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:59,200
What did he do it for
if he was so decent?

17
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,847
I heard he had a sister?

18
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:05,447
Next county over...
still there as far as I know.

19
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:07,619
What about the farmhands?

20
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:08,994
Migrants mostly.

21
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:11,329
They move on after the harvest is done...

22
00:03:11,556 --> 00:03:13,961
except for one, and he lives downtown.

23
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:15,601
How do I find him?

24
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:17,249
Well, I could get you an address...

25
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:19,785
but I think you might be
wasting your time.

26
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:22,400
The man's become some kind of recluse...

27
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:25,215
from what I hear,
completely shut himself up.

28
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,008
People bring him things to fix.

29
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:28,900
Things to fix?

30
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:40,788
Hello, misses Taylor...
my name is Ruth young.

31
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:44,931
I'd really like to talk to you
about your brother...

32
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:47,474
if you don't mind.

33
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:51,722
I'm sorry, it's a little hard
to explain over the phone.

34
00:03:52,308 --> 00:03:54,237
Can you call me, please?

35
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:52,312
I'm looking for a Miller, Lee.

36
00:04:54,643 --> 00:04:56,789
Am I at the right address?

37
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,570
What do you want?

38
00:04:58,773 --> 00:05:01,568
Well I was wondering
if I could talk to you.

39
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:03,757
Well, ain't you?

40
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:07,773
Well, it's a little involved.

41
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,038
There somewhere we could sit down?

42
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:16,581
I, I tried calling,
you got no phone apparently.

43
00:05:16,865 --> 00:05:18,950
I, I think you mighta know someone.

44
00:05:19,162 --> 00:05:20,755
Her name was Gale.

45
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,802
You work on the Taylor
farm some years back?

46
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,191
I talked to the sheriff this morning.

47
00:05:28,216 --> 00:05:30,121
Then you heard all there is to know.

48
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:34,666
All right, but I thought
since you work there, and all...

49
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,519
It was... some time ago.

50
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:39,792
Yes, sir.

51
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:44,034
See, I just wanted to...

52
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:48,206
Wanted to know what she was like.

53
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:50,332
No, I can't help you.

54
00:05:50,357 --> 00:05:53,692
Well, I could... I could leave you
my number in case...

55
00:05:57,794 --> 00:05:59,162
All right.

56
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,037
All right.

57
00:06:58,692 --> 00:06:59,925
Quiet.

58
00:07:02,512 --> 00:07:03,922
Mister Taylor?

59
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:05,311
What do you want?

60
00:07:05,336 --> 00:07:07,742
I heard you're hiring for the season.

61
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:13,241
You know, a month or two is fine
for me if you got something.

62
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,953
You ever worked tobacco before?

63
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:17,240
No sir, but I got no
problem with hard work.

64
00:07:17,265 --> 00:07:20,201
Besides that, I can fix most any
mechanical thing you got around here.

65
00:07:20,226 --> 00:07:21,547
That so?

66
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,380
Think you can get that thing running?

67
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:25,105
I can take a look at it.

68
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,216
Why don't you, and come on back here...

69
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:29,920
tell me what's wrong with it.

70
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:31,289
Yes, sir.

71
00:07:32,726 --> 00:07:35,256
Hey, put it in your pocket.

72
00:07:35,764 --> 00:07:37,818
Take the damn thing off
and put it in your pocket.

73
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:41,960
I told you guys, nothing
that can catch in the machine.

74
00:07:48,878 --> 00:07:50,246
Go home.

75
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:00,055
Needs a new starter.

76
00:08:05,783 --> 00:08:07,836
You'll need 'em for
the oil on the leaves.

77
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:09,953
You can return 'em when you get your own.

78
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:11,774
Be here at five tomorrow morning...

79
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:14,693
fix the tractor, put
you out in the fields.

80
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:16,491
Pay's at the end of the week.

81
00:08:16,516 --> 00:08:17,921
At least I'll get a few days outta you...

82
00:08:17,945 --> 00:08:19,931
before you run off and drink it all.

83
00:08:20,128 --> 00:08:21,628
I ain't like that.

84
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:24,425
I said I ain't like that, sir.

85
00:08:24,886 --> 00:08:28,933
You drop that sir
bullshit, you know my name.

86
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,786
Mine's, Miller.

87
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:13,518
I guess you know what I'm here for.

88
00:09:13,826 --> 00:09:15,801
Owner' got himself pretty worked up
at this point.

89
00:09:15,826 --> 00:09:19,701
Says I bring it to him today,
or he'll come get it himself.

90
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:22,836
Well hell...

91
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,633
let me see it at least,
I got to tell him something.

92
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,374
Well...

93
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,374
it's coming along.

94
00:09:36,888 --> 00:09:39,772
Fine work, like always.

95
00:09:40,007 --> 00:09:42,804
Well, god damn it, how
long do I tell him?

96
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:44,436
A week.

97
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:47,429
I think week.
- You're killing me here.

98
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,249
You do the work, you keep on living here.

99
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:50,684
You don't, you can get the hell out.

100
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,898
I ain't running a charity.

101
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:54,105
I paid 100 for materials.

102
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:57,064
Can you cover me?
- Christ all mighty!

103
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:58,765
I come for the furniture
I leave empty handed...

104
00:09:58,789 --> 00:10:00,710
and $100 lighter?

105
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,668
Ain't that just wonderful?

106
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,643
You keep the place this neat...

107
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:14,462
gotta have a girl around somewhere.

108
00:10:14,886 --> 00:10:17,384
I just like things a certain way, is all.

109
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,335
Well, Becky says
you being all by yourself...

110
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,355
is the worst thing that
can happen for a man.

111
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:25,555
I'm all right.

112
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,829
Says in prison they put a man
in solitary just to torture him.

113
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:31,365
I mean, go figure that.

114
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,636
A man would rather spend his days...

115
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:37,017
with killers and psychopaths
than be by himself.

116
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,201
I guess that explains marriage too,
don't it?

117
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:42,400
You got that cash on ya?

118
00:10:43,822 --> 00:10:45,355
All right, yeah.

119
00:10:47,726 --> 00:10:49,018
Hundred...

120
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:52,557
I shouldn't be giving you this.

121
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:06,992
Well, you're in luck.

122
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:11,861
There it is, $100, don't say
I never did nothing for ya.

123
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:13,781
This thing...

124
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,873
there's no reason that...

125
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:25,661
You've got to pull through for me,
you understand?

126
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,336
I'm a man of my word,
I've given this guy my word.

127
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,674
He's given us a lot of
business, you know he has.

128
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:31,069
I've already gone back
to him to him twice.

129
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:32,714
I'm going back one more time and see

130
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:34,936
if I can buy you two or
three days, but that's it.

131
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,284
After that, you have got to...

132
00:14:35,845 --> 00:14:37,408
Dance with me.

133
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,529
Don't you know how to dance?

134
00:15:26,289 --> 00:15:27,933
I was in the neighborhood.

135
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,633
There ain't but one neighborhood
in this town.

136
00:15:30,883 --> 00:15:32,125
Right.

137
00:15:33,158 --> 00:15:34,725
Sir, I'm just asking you...

138
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,767
Look I told you...

139
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,117
because I seen it, on your face.

140
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:42,539
When I said her name you knew her.

141
00:15:43,118 --> 00:15:45,131
I know what that man did to here.

142
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:47,842
I just, I wanna know why.

143
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:51,417
You worked on that farm,
you gotta have some idea.

144
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,714
What's it matter to you?

145
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:57,864
I'm her daughter.

146
00:16:09,054 --> 00:16:10,984
An interesting place.

147
00:16:11,861 --> 00:16:13,781
What was it, a factory?

148
00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:15,554
Abattoir.

149
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:21,417
A slaughter house...
- I know what an abattoir is.

150
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,884
No, don't touch it.

151
00:16:42,761 --> 00:16:44,362
Is it valuable?

152
00:16:48,864 --> 00:16:50,591
How'd you come by it?

153
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:54,566
A rich family bought a
plantation outside of town.

154
00:16:54,852 --> 00:16:57,168
I'm restoring every piece of it.

155
00:17:01,304 --> 00:17:03,382
I heard you don't get out much.

156
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:05,537
How come you don't talk to no one?

157
00:17:05,562 --> 00:17:06,874
What for?

158
00:17:11,046 --> 00:17:12,607
It's just one.

159
00:17:14,693 --> 00:17:16,420
Ain't he lonely?

160
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:18,425
No, he's all right.

161
00:17:21,454 --> 00:17:24,277
They say fish got no memory, anyhow.

162
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,988
Now how'd anyone know if that's true?

163
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:36,521
What you staring for?

164
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:38,900
I seen that smile before.

165
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:46,319
My grandma died a month back.

166
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:49,584
She raised me like I was her daughter.

167
00:17:49,855 --> 00:17:53,180
I thought I was... 'til now.

168
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,884
I found these letters.

169
00:17:59,524 --> 00:18:02,266
It's my real mama trying to explain to me
why she ran off...

170
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,875
after I was born.

171
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:12,025
I ain't looking to stir nothing' up.

172
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,350
I just wanna know, is all.

173
00:18:15,882 --> 00:18:17,443
Where you come from?

174
00:18:17,468 --> 00:18:19,390
Out near Asheville.

175
00:18:19,694 --> 00:18:22,053
Gale never said nothing about us?

176
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:34,446
She sent this, in one of her letters.

177
00:18:44,232 --> 00:18:46,060
She's real beautiful.

178
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:50,669
Can you just tell me something about her?

179
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,499
Just any old thing?

180
00:19:07,636 --> 00:19:09,792
We harvest from the bottom up.

181
00:19:10,003 --> 00:19:12,230
We passed through this field twice,
all ready.

182
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,097
Every pass we pick from the lowest level.

183
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:35,639
It's been empty since I bought it.

184
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:38,740
Thought I'd convert it into apartments...

185
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,990
but the historical commission got word.

186
00:19:41,225 --> 00:19:44,115
Told me I wasn't changing a damn thing.

187
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:47,238
Place sits abandoned for 40 years and...

188
00:19:47,678 --> 00:19:49,761
suddenly it's a land mark.

189
00:19:51,927 --> 00:19:53,266
The water work?

190
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:55,848
Yup, just gotta turn it on for ya?

191
00:19:55,873 --> 00:19:57,067
How long ya thinking?

192
00:19:57,092 --> 00:20:00,662
Well...
a few months, I guess.

193
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:08,406
Where's that go?

194
00:20:08,636 --> 00:20:09,759
Downstairs.

195
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:12,366
Back in the day,
they brought the cows down there.

196
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:14,712
Kept them all in the big room
just below us...

197
00:20:14,737 --> 00:20:17,765
killed them in another room
on the other side.

198
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:22,054
Look, like I said...

199
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:25,149
I can't do nothing to spruce the place up.

200
00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:28,425
So you want it, or don't ya?

201
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,792
Uriah, hey, how you been?

202
00:20:41,817 --> 00:20:43,080
I'm doing fine.

203
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:44,275
Mighty nice to see you.

204
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:46,432
Oh yeah, I haven't seen you all year.
Did you crop that late?

205
00:20:46,456 --> 00:20:49,963
Well, what's been happening?
- Quality crop, it's B1.

206
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:52,260
No way, I can't go B1, this is not B1.

207
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,182
You know that, look at it,
it's too much green,

208
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:55,886
too much brown, it's not clean enough.

209
00:20:55,911 --> 00:20:57,753
That's B1 if it's anything.

210
00:20:57,778 --> 00:21:00,352
It's B2.
- Look, that's all I got.

211
00:21:00,377 --> 00:21:02,854
B2's the best I can do, I'm sorry.

212
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:04,266
Well, how much?

213
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,485
213 a pound, that's pretty good.

214
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,119
You're stealing my tobacco,
you know that?

215
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:10,102
It's as good a quality
as any you got here.

216
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:13,634
Right, look, take it or leave it.
That's all I've got.

217
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,460
Hey, come here.

218
00:21:28,485 --> 00:21:29,743
What?

219
00:21:37,101 --> 00:21:38,645
Don't touch me.

220
00:21:41,913 --> 00:21:45,211
Give it to me. Give it to me.

221
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:48,768
What the hell you keep this for?
- Give it to me, Uriah.

222
00:22:09,102 --> 00:22:11,270
I know about that ring.

223
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:15,261
It was her daddy's wedding band.

224
00:22:16,226 --> 00:22:18,988
He died when she was ten.

225
00:22:19,911 --> 00:22:23,989
She said in her letters that was all
that she had left of him.

226
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:56,874
I was hoping better things
mighta come her way.

227
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:01,897
Mama, well her mama,
she got married again...

228
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,867
a couple years after, and there I came.

229
00:23:05,078 --> 00:23:09,020
I guess Gale and my daddy
never got along too well.

230
00:23:10,228 --> 00:23:12,469
Can you tell me more about her?

231
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:27,905
Ma'am, I'm sorry to trouble you.

232
00:23:28,243 --> 00:23:29,540
Who are you?

233
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:30,993
Name's Miller.

234
00:23:31,407 --> 00:23:33,306
I'm working for your...

235
00:23:34,165 --> 00:23:37,137
Well, he gave me these
until I could get my own.

236
00:23:37,523 --> 00:23:40,446
So... I'm returning them.

237
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:42,682
I'll be sure he gets 'em.

238
00:23:42,707 --> 00:23:44,573
I'd appreciate that.

239
00:23:47,743 --> 00:23:48,986
Well?

240
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,061
I...

241
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:04,972
I know it ain't my business, but
I saw what happened this morning.

242
00:24:07,564 --> 00:24:10,314
Well, I was just wondering
if you were okay.

243
00:24:10,704 --> 00:24:12,493
You were right the first time.

244
00:24:12,694 --> 00:24:14,392
It ain't your business.

245
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,209
I saw you at my house.

246
00:24:42,643 --> 00:24:46,726
My wife...
ain't none of your concern.

247
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:49,224
That clear?

248
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:13,519
I'm sorry about your loss.

249
00:25:14,562 --> 00:25:15,811
It's late.

250
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:20,873
All right.

251
00:25:21,944 --> 00:25:24,146
Well, I'll be going then.

252
00:25:27,447 --> 00:25:29,945
Hey, maybe I come by again,
if that's all right.

253
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,861
There ain't no reason to.

254
00:25:32,602 --> 00:25:34,639
I done what I can for you.

255
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,141
You know anything
about working on a farm?

256
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:06,329
Don't look like it!
You cost me 100 a day!

257
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:23,244
Jesus Christ.

258
00:26:28,001 --> 00:26:30,109
Get the hell off my farm!

259
00:26:30,457 --> 00:26:32,117
All you fuckers!

260
00:26:33,226 --> 00:26:34,893
I said get!

261
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:41,398
Hey! God damn it, wait a minute!
- I've had my fill of this!

262
00:26:41,626 --> 00:26:43,251
To hell with you!

263
00:26:43,556 --> 00:26:47,064
All right, maybe I lost
my composure a little bit.

264
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:48,876
You done good...

265
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:51,718
I'm grateful to ya.

266
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:59,769
Come on, now. It's late.

267
00:27:00,793 --> 00:27:03,988
How 'bout you come on,
have supper with us.

268
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,097
I reckon I owe you that.

269
00:27:12,201 --> 00:27:14,466
Don't you want more?
- No.

270
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,771
Thank you, ma'am.

271
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,170
So, where you going after season's out?

272
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,662
South.

273
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,974
Like what, Florida?

274
00:27:24,303 --> 00:27:28,288
No, way down, Brazil, Argentina.

275
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:30,091
What for?

276
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:33,802
No reason, I just want to.

277
00:27:36,953 --> 00:27:40,141
I seen a lot pass through here, drifting.

278
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,350
Don't own nothing but their clothes...

279
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:45,367
and most of 'em
are running from something.

280
00:27:46,127 --> 00:27:47,797
You ever done time?

281
00:27:48,987 --> 00:27:51,635
Well, shit... I have.

282
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:55,657
Banker man, right here on my property...

283
00:27:55,682 --> 00:27:57,807
telling me he's gonna take this farm.

284
00:27:58,026 --> 00:28:00,454
He's talking and talking, I just watched...

285
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:03,232
his jaw move until I
couldn't stand it no more.

286
00:28:03,257 --> 00:28:07,229
I cracked his skull...
busted his eye socket in.

287
00:28:07,506 --> 00:28:09,743
Looked more like a cut of meat
than a man.

288
00:28:09,944 --> 00:28:13,059
And Gale here, she's screaming at me...

289
00:28:13,575 --> 00:28:16,843
even turned the hose on me
like I was some kind of rabbit dog.

290
00:28:17,054 --> 00:28:18,495
Didn't ya darling?

291
00:28:18,794 --> 00:28:22,354
God's sake, Uriah, you
gotta tell that story?

292
00:28:33,183 --> 00:28:34,988
I did three years for that.

293
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:36,894
I got no regrets.

294
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:40,105
A man can't defend his home...

295
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:43,316
he ain't worth shit.

296
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,315
Who's that?

297
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,227
That looks like Jimmy.

298
00:28:56,516 --> 00:28:59,438
Jimmy, come on in.
- Hey, Uriah.

299
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:02,118
Hope I didn't interrupt nothing.

300
00:29:02,805 --> 00:29:04,383
You're okay.

301
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:08,156
What's up?
- Well, I'm on that construction job...

302
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:11,498
they're doing up on route 70.
Could use a man to run the paver.

303
00:29:11,523 --> 00:29:13,223
Yeah, starting when?

304
00:29:13,248 --> 00:29:14,633
Well, tomorrow.

305
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:16,220
You serious?

306
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:21,000
I can ask Frank if you can't.
I just thought I'd come to you first.

307
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,673
Don't bother about it.

308
00:29:28,502 --> 00:29:30,197
You want another beer, or something?

309
00:29:30,222 --> 00:29:31,970
No, I'm fine.

310
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:40,505
The place is real nice.

311
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:42,224
You think so?

312
00:29:46,466 --> 00:29:48,615
How long you two been married?

313
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,628
Now, why you wanna know that?

314
00:30:00,476 --> 00:30:01,686
Well?

315
00:30:02,512 --> 00:30:04,926
They need someone
for that highway project...

316
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:06,364
union wage.

317
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:07,966
How long?

318
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:10,187
A few days.

319
00:30:10,212 --> 00:30:11,929
Got another job, or something?

320
00:30:11,954 --> 00:30:15,173
You think anyone's making
a living from farming?

321
00:30:16,008 --> 00:30:19,516
Listen, I got to have that
crop done before the frost.

322
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:22,288
Looks like I'm a bit short handed
at the moment still...

323
00:30:22,313 --> 00:30:25,383
I appreciate you sticking around a bit longer.

324
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,291
I guess I could.

325
00:30:30,469 --> 00:30:33,490
I need you to go into town tomorrow,
round up some help for the field.

326
00:30:33,515 --> 00:30:35,422
Think you can do that?

327
00:30:35,665 --> 00:30:36,946
All right.

328
00:30:44,283 --> 00:30:46,918
Miller? I know you're there.

329
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,753
I ain't going nowhere.

330
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,383
Are you deaf?

331
00:31:01,836 --> 00:31:03,443
I brought you coffee.

332
00:31:03,672 --> 00:31:05,984
I thought you might like some.

333
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,606
I'll just stay a little while.

334
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,340
Look, I don't wanna do this.
- Do what?

335
00:31:14,231 --> 00:31:15,863
We're just talking.

336
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:20,495
What if I help you, then?

337
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,211
Like how?

338
00:31:24,117 --> 00:31:26,044
Well, there's gotta be something.

339
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:28,269
I got two hands, don't I?

340
00:31:34,373 --> 00:31:36,225
Hold it steady, now.

341
00:31:36,691 --> 00:31:39,672
Come on, you doing this, or not?
- I'm doing it.

342
00:31:44,756 --> 00:31:46,924
Some things don't change.

343
00:31:48,111 --> 00:31:49,584
How's that?

344
00:31:50,226 --> 00:31:53,795
When I was just a girl,
my daddy never let me do anything.

345
00:31:54,084 --> 00:31:55,598
I was always just holding stuff...

346
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:59,498
a flashlight, a screwdriver,
hold this, hold that.

347
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:03,428
Well, that's called apprenticeship.

348
00:32:03,699 --> 00:32:05,566
It's called boring.

349
00:32:07,803 --> 00:32:09,850
When'd you see him last?

350
00:32:10,358 --> 00:32:12,186
A while, I guess.

351
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,231
How come?

352
00:32:14,654 --> 00:32:16,248
Something happen to him?

353
00:32:16,522 --> 00:32:18,358
I don't mean to be...

354
00:32:19,373 --> 00:32:23,037
I just don't know
if that's any of your concern, is all.

355
00:32:23,553 --> 00:32:25,423
Ain't none of is my concern.

356
00:32:25,448 --> 00:32:28,514
You're the one that come here
asking questions.

357
00:32:35,523 --> 00:32:37,289
Hell, my old man...

358
00:32:39,073 --> 00:32:41,851
he beat on me, I mean good.

359
00:32:42,523 --> 00:32:46,875
I grew up trying to be invisible,
hiding, you know.

360
00:32:47,273 --> 00:32:49,164
I was five years old...

361
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:53,179
he knocked me out cold.

362
00:32:57,826 --> 00:33:01,095
Hey, hand me that knife, would ya?

363
00:33:08,602 --> 00:33:10,836
That looks pretty painful.

364
00:33:12,579 --> 00:33:14,413
How it is, you know.

365
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,102
Old man up and died some years back.

366
00:33:23,215 --> 00:33:24,930
Funny thing though...

367
00:33:25,775 --> 00:33:27,525
I'm sorry about it.

368
00:33:28,073 --> 00:33:30,251
Now I just wanna see him.

369
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:31,742
What for?

370
00:33:32,171 --> 00:33:34,815
I'd just like to know him, is all.

371
00:33:35,245 --> 00:33:39,365
More of a man than what he done
when he was too young to know better.

372
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:43,020
Say he don't act the same,
or think the same.

373
00:33:43,045 --> 00:33:44,611
Watch your fingers!

374
00:33:46,785 --> 00:33:49,074
After a few years,
not a single piece of you...

375
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:51,099
is what it was, you know that?

376
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:54,097
Well, it's a fact.

377
00:33:55,246 --> 00:34:00,129
Every cell in your body,
every hair on your head, it's all dying...

378
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,740
and replaced by something new.

379
00:34:05,135 --> 00:34:08,965
You shed your skin...
a hundred times.

380
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:11,199
What you done...

381
00:34:11,224 --> 00:34:14,238
well... you can't shed that.

382
00:34:18,482 --> 00:34:20,783
I started having dreams.

383
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:22,855
Dreams?

384
00:34:23,803 --> 00:34:26,746
Things I'm seeing when I'm just a baby.

385
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:58,601
Saw same face in the picture,
but she's just a girl.

386
00:34:59,255 --> 00:35:01,101
She's staring at me...

387
00:35:01,578 --> 00:35:04,484
like she needs to tell me something.

388
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,820
Her mouth opens but she don't have
a voice to speak.

389
00:35:10,196 --> 00:35:11,897
In my dream I'm...

390
00:35:14,523 --> 00:35:16,031
I'm wondering...

391
00:35:16,056 --> 00:35:19,687
what's she done to make my daddy
punish her like that.

392
00:35:29,144 --> 00:35:32,168
She was just fourteen when she had me.

393
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:37,935
Hey Miller?

394
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:41,107
Why did he do it?

395
00:35:51,163 --> 00:35:52,554
Miller!

396
00:35:53,772 --> 00:35:57,093
They'll be hanging around
Montgomery street, get three.

397
00:35:57,311 --> 00:35:58,966
Yeah, all right.

398
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,353
I'm back on Friday.

399
00:36:00,378 --> 00:36:03,562
All the north fields done by then, right?

400
00:37:17,231 --> 00:37:18,798
All righty then.

401
00:37:19,065 --> 00:37:20,885
Same time tomorrow.
- Yep.

402
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,846
Y'all good with that?
Yep.

403
00:37:22,871 --> 00:37:24,269
I'm gonna drop the keys off.
- Okay.

404
00:37:24,293 --> 00:37:25,893
Have a good night.

405
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:45,629
We're done for the day.

406
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:52,745
Something else you need?

407
00:38:05,647 --> 00:38:07,631
I saw you looking for it.

408
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:10,530
A little big for you, ain't it?

409
00:38:10,835 --> 00:38:13,568
Well, it...

410
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:21,965
All this about you going south.

411
00:38:22,263 --> 00:38:23,661
How come?

412
00:38:24,317 --> 00:38:25,692
You running?

413
00:38:26,726 --> 00:38:28,843
That Uriah's take on it?

414
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:31,984
He thinks you're kinda strange.
- Well...

415
00:38:32,273 --> 00:38:33,807
that's mutual.

416
00:38:36,406 --> 00:38:37,648
So?

417
00:38:39,297 --> 00:38:42,129
I'm just curious to see
something in this world.

418
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:43,543
Ain't you?

419
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:46,354
I'm all right where I am.

420
00:38:47,232 --> 00:38:50,082
Just 'cause somewhere's different
don't make it better.

421
00:38:50,107 --> 00:38:51,287
Well...

422
00:38:52,462 --> 00:38:55,929
you might look around a bit first,
before you decide.

423
00:39:00,541 --> 00:39:02,849
I heard the state fair is in town.

424
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:05,783
What about it?
- Nothing.

425
00:39:06,743 --> 00:39:09,166
Just I ain't never seen one before.

426
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:12,234
It's funny working alongside of you.

427
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:16,554
It's like you don't even know
the time's passing.

428
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:21,929
What goes through your mind,
all these days you're alone?

429
00:41:25,514 --> 00:41:27,436
I can see her sometimes...

430
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,365
when I look at you.

431
00:41:33,092 --> 00:41:35,295
It's nice if that were true.

432
00:41:35,912 --> 00:41:37,435
I know it ain't.

433
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,568
She's much prettier than I'll ever be.

434
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,215
For you.

435
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:53,292
You giving this to me?

436
00:41:53,317 --> 00:41:55,145
If, if you want it.

437
00:41:57,126 --> 00:41:58,575
Thank you.

438
00:42:00,301 --> 00:42:02,819
You know, you think you know yourself...

439
00:42:03,028 --> 00:42:05,688
who you are, where you came from.

440
00:42:05,915 --> 00:42:08,082
I ain't got a clue no more.

441
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:12,077
Can you understand that?

442
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,778
I guess it's late.

443
00:42:21,066 --> 00:42:22,699
Suppose I should go.

444
00:42:24,873 --> 00:42:26,269
All right.

445
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:31,152
I was thinking about what you said.

446
00:42:31,177 --> 00:42:32,475
You...

447
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,507
you think people can change?

448
00:42:38,502 --> 00:42:42,771
I think if you do good,
you can be good...

449
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,966
no matter what you done before.

450
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:52,038
Good night, Miller.

451
00:43:21,487 --> 00:43:25,518
Well... like I told you,
ain't much to see.

452
00:43:28,197 --> 00:43:30,631
Looks like time stood still.

453
00:43:31,782 --> 00:43:33,634
They kept cows here?

454
00:43:33,968 --> 00:43:35,338
So I'm told.

455
00:43:36,032 --> 00:43:37,814
Pretty sparse.

456
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:41,084
Well... they're just here to die.

457
00:43:41,462 --> 00:43:43,259
They don't need much else.

458
00:43:44,513 --> 00:43:46,072
They killed 'em in there.

459
00:43:46,322 --> 00:43:48,478
Hung 'em up to bleed out...

460
00:43:48,822 --> 00:43:51,822
and then they'd freeze 'em,
store 'em in here.

461
00:43:52,857 --> 00:43:55,357
Do you think they knew
they were gonna get killed?

462
00:43:55,555 --> 00:43:57,603
Well now, there's a question.

463
00:44:01,745 --> 00:44:05,495
Jesus, look at that old relic.

464
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,549
Does it work?

465
00:44:11,307 --> 00:44:12,861
I ain't tried it.

466
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,566
Moment of truth.

467
00:44:34,256 --> 00:44:36,562
Don't you know how to dance?

468
00:44:38,444 --> 00:44:41,213
Well, all right, I'll show you.

469
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,529
Hang on, I'll make it easy for you.

470
00:45:06,564 --> 00:45:07,923
Jesus...

471
00:45:46,158 --> 00:45:47,713
What time is it?

472
00:45:48,493 --> 00:45:49,994
About five.

473
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:52,624
He'll be back soon.

474
00:45:54,246 --> 00:45:57,432
Don't play with me now, I gotta go.
- Don't go.

475
00:45:57,457 --> 00:45:59,321
I'm serious.
- So am I.

476
00:45:59,646 --> 00:46:01,249
You're crazy.

477
00:46:01,499 --> 00:46:04,200
Come on Miller, let go.
- You could come with me.

478
00:46:04,434 --> 00:46:07,191
What?
- I said you could come with me.

479
00:46:07,855 --> 00:46:09,129
I take you so far from here...

480
00:46:09,154 --> 00:46:12,221
you wouldn't ever have to come back.

481
00:46:13,462 --> 00:46:15,829
You don't know much, do you?

482
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:20,204
Ain't no simple thing,
a wife leaving her husband.

483
00:46:21,132 --> 00:46:24,516
Come on now, let me go.

484
00:46:30,551 --> 00:46:33,293
Take from someone what's his, well...

485
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,386
you best think twice about that.

486
00:46:38,005 --> 00:46:42,274
Comes a time, though,
you can't see past what you want.

487
00:46:43,733 --> 00:46:45,136
Desire...

488
00:46:46,828 --> 00:46:48,916
Can't feel nothing else.

489
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,929
Like stepping into a river.

490
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,411
Water rushing.

491
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,732
Your feet leaving the earth.

492
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:19,038
I never made love to no one before.

493
00:47:20,899 --> 00:47:23,681
Just had men take what they want.

494
00:47:24,684 --> 00:47:26,587
Ain't the same thing.

495
00:47:33,673 --> 00:47:35,181
When you go...

496
00:47:35,642 --> 00:47:37,197
I'd go with you.

497
00:47:38,736 --> 00:47:40,775
If you still want me to.

498
00:47:41,461 --> 00:47:42,962
Do you, still?

499
00:48:05,971 --> 00:48:07,539
Where you been?

500
00:48:08,736 --> 00:48:10,502
I didn't know you were back.

501
00:48:10,717 --> 00:48:12,994
I woulda made you something.

502
00:48:14,503 --> 00:48:15,947
Come here.

503
00:48:22,126 --> 00:48:23,844
Asked you a question.

504
00:48:24,085 --> 00:48:25,451
Where you been?

505
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:26,953
Nowhere...

506
00:48:28,157 --> 00:48:29,570
just walking.

507
00:48:30,531 --> 00:48:32,204
Walking where?

508
00:48:37,158 --> 00:48:39,251
I said walking where?

509
00:48:40,797 --> 00:48:44,103
I told you, just walking.

510
00:48:47,807 --> 00:48:50,736
You wouldn't make a
fool out of me, would ya?

511
00:48:51,338 --> 00:48:52,892
You ever did...

512
00:48:54,455 --> 00:48:56,439
I don't know what I'd do.

513
00:48:56,845 --> 00:48:59,264
Uriah, please.

514
00:49:09,252 --> 00:49:10,786
You're so pretty.

515
00:49:15,145 --> 00:49:16,847
Take your dress off.

516
00:49:19,607 --> 00:49:21,119
Take it off.

517
00:49:22,349 --> 00:49:23,728
Do it!

518
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:46,472
Keep going.

519
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:46,996
Shoulda harvested like two weeks ago.

520
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,774
I want you to.

521
00:51:48,589 --> 00:51:50,166
I'll get him.

522
00:51:52,062 --> 00:51:53,846
I promise I will.

523
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:18,499
I dream I walk through this door...

524
00:52:20,858 --> 00:52:22,601
and you're there.

525
00:52:23,382 --> 00:52:25,124
Same as you were...

526
00:52:26,414 --> 00:52:28,437
same as I was.

527
00:52:29,328 --> 00:52:30,671
Time...

528
00:52:31,175 --> 00:52:33,844
everything played out different.

529
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:59,457
Ma'am, my name is Ruth Young.

530
00:54:00,047 --> 00:54:03,590
I left you a message already
about your brother, Uriah.

531
00:54:04,029 --> 00:54:05,608
You please call me?

532
00:54:05,914 --> 00:54:07,713
My number is 9...

533
00:54:10,469 --> 00:54:11,646
Hey Ruth.

534
00:54:11,889 --> 00:54:13,789
He speaks my name.

535
00:54:15,696 --> 00:54:17,076
What's that?

536
00:54:22,628 --> 00:54:25,066
They told me this was the good stuff.

537
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:27,644
What do you think?
- Well...

538
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:29,991
we'll find out.

539
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:35,264
I guess you think this is
some kind of tactic.

540
00:54:35,289 --> 00:54:38,084
Get you drunk, get the truth outta you.

541
00:54:39,515 --> 00:54:41,390
I hope you're a happy drunk.

542
00:54:43,054 --> 00:54:45,284
I can't get drunk no more.

543
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:51,088
Drink don't make me feel nothing,
one way or the other.

544
00:54:51,624 --> 00:54:53,691
I tried it often enough.

545
00:54:54,662 --> 00:54:56,377
God help you.

546
00:54:57,681 --> 00:55:00,564
Well hey, look at that.

547
00:55:01,689 --> 00:55:03,832
This looks god damn amazing.

548
00:55:04,216 --> 00:55:05,382
Yeah?

549
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:07,937
Are you kidding?

550
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:11,812
It's great.

551
00:55:14,435 --> 00:55:16,827
Wow, beautiful.

552
00:55:22,089 --> 00:55:24,688
Did you... go through the night
to get this done?

553
00:55:24,713 --> 00:55:26,547
Something like that.

554
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:31,048
Look, I'm grateful to ya.

555
00:55:31,497 --> 00:55:32,814
What for?

556
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:38,095
You bought me a little piece,
for one night at least.

557
00:55:39,123 --> 00:55:40,427
Well...

558
00:55:41,576 --> 00:55:43,913
now how about we celebrate.

559
00:56:35,407 --> 00:56:36,874
Pour me another.

560
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:42,075
Don't go getting all stupid on me, now.
Oh, don't you worry about me.

561
00:56:42,272 --> 00:56:44,350
I'm tougher than you think.

562
00:56:44,585 --> 00:56:45,811
Are ya?

563
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:48,372
Hell yes, I am.

564
00:57:06,287 --> 00:57:07,803
Hey, Miller.

565
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:11,694
I gotta ask you one more thing.

566
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:15,389
What's that?

567
00:57:17,357 --> 00:57:19,897
You tell me about her last day?

568
00:57:20,647 --> 00:57:22,029
Please?

569
00:57:22,054 --> 00:57:24,515
Just everything you remember.

570
00:57:25,451 --> 00:57:28,544
Well, what good's that gonna do?
- Oh, just tell me, please.

571
00:57:28,782 --> 00:57:32,815
Just tell me, and I won't ever ask you
for nothing else.

572
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:39,956
You know, you're something.
Coming here asking all these questions...

573
00:57:39,981 --> 00:57:43,395
like I oughta, bare my sole to you,
like I owe you something?

574
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,093
I never said that!
- But you ain't told me a whole lot.

575
00:57:46,118 --> 00:57:48,020
How 'bout you talk some?
- About what?

576
00:57:48,045 --> 00:57:50,718
I suppose you tell me why she'd
just up and leave her daughter behind.

577
00:57:50,742 --> 00:57:52,267
She didn't seem the type to me.
- I don't know.

578
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:54,259
Oh, you don't know?
- How should I?

579
00:57:54,284 --> 00:57:57,265
Well I wonder, there's something
in that strange family of yours,

580
00:57:57,290 --> 00:57:59,380
you musta given it some thought.

581
00:57:59,606 --> 00:58:02,311
I bet you got a pretty
good idea, actually.

582
00:58:02,591 --> 00:58:05,641
You're a real bastard, you know that?

583
00:58:05,975 --> 00:58:07,266
Am I?

584
00:58:08,107 --> 00:58:10,041
Who are you to judge?

585
00:58:22,574 --> 00:58:24,230
Mommy, mommy.

586
00:58:25,863 --> 00:58:29,933
How come daddy
doesn't love me just like Gale?

587
00:58:30,217 --> 00:58:33,703
What are you talking about, honey?
He loves you just the same.

588
00:58:33,728 --> 00:58:38,323
How come daddy doesn't kiss me
just like Gale?

589
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:40,925
What'd you just say?

590
00:58:41,128 --> 00:58:43,976
I didn't want to mama, he made me!

591
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:45,977
He made me!
- You're own father!

592
00:58:46,002 --> 00:58:47,610
He ain't my father.

593
00:58:47,635 --> 00:58:50,030
He's just some asshole
you let into our home.

594
00:58:50,055 --> 00:58:51,526
You get the hell out!

595
00:58:52,212 --> 00:58:54,148
If I go, I'm taking her with me.

596
00:58:54,173 --> 00:58:56,182
Like hell you will!

597
00:58:59,797 --> 00:59:01,909
You leave her be, Gale.

598
00:59:02,277 --> 00:59:03,550
I mean it.

599
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:06,180
How's a little tramp like you...

600
00:59:06,735 --> 00:59:08,355
with a baby.

601
00:59:12,246 --> 00:59:14,534
You can go to hell, mama.

602
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:24,285
She'd a kept her secrets to stay with us...

603
00:59:25,832 --> 00:59:28,267
but I brought it all to light.

604
00:59:30,896 --> 00:59:32,610
I made her go.

605
00:59:37,123 --> 00:59:39,716
There's something I want you to know.

606
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,545
I did my best to...

607
00:59:43,935 --> 00:59:45,473
care for her.

608
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:48,317
I want you to know that.

609
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:52,871
Care for her?

610
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,342
Why would you?

611
00:59:57,992 --> 00:59:59,560
I wanted...

612
01:00:02,721 --> 01:00:06,988
I wanted more than anything
to be the man that was good to her.

613
01:00:07,939 --> 01:00:11,064
I wanted to be the one
that treated her kind.

614
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,760
I did her no harm.

615
01:00:15,661 --> 01:00:17,572
She was real to me.

616
01:00:19,691 --> 01:00:21,758
She's all that ever was.

617
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:27,204
Is that why he killed my mama?

618
01:00:27,602 --> 01:00:32,680
Is that why you never said nothing
about you and her?

619
01:00:35,551 --> 01:00:37,467
God damn it, tell me!

620
01:00:37,709 --> 01:00:40,301
What's it matter now?
- 'Cause it does, 'cause it's the truth.

621
01:00:40,326 --> 01:00:42,736
Oh, like that's some precious thing.

622
01:00:42,993 --> 01:00:44,239
What do you think?

623
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:48,090
That I'm some little girl,
you gotta shield my eyes?

624
01:00:48,418 --> 01:00:50,752
You're the one
all caged up in here hiding.

625
01:00:50,777 --> 01:00:52,413
You're the one scared!

626
01:00:52,764 --> 01:00:54,516
You tell me why he did it.

627
01:00:54,793 --> 01:00:57,194
Tell me! Was it 'cause of you?

628
01:00:57,219 --> 01:00:58,946
Is that why she's dead?
- Watch your mouth.

629
01:00:58,971 --> 01:01:03,075
That's why he killed her, ain't it?
Because you fucked her!

630
01:01:07,954 --> 01:01:09,656
I'm sorry, Ruth.

631
01:01:11,183 --> 01:01:12,950
I didn't mean that.

632
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,286
Jesus, we were so careful.

633
01:01:18,311 --> 01:01:20,311
We were so god damn careful.

634
01:01:20,537 --> 01:01:24,413
I told her, don't be scared.
I said I'd take care of her.

635
01:01:25,585 --> 01:01:28,483
She said I'd be scared too if I knew him.

636
01:01:29,303 --> 01:01:31,116
He'll come looking.

637
01:01:32,265 --> 01:01:33,725
I know he will.

638
01:01:33,954 --> 01:01:36,006
She said we oughta wait
'til he goes off again...

639
01:01:36,031 --> 01:01:38,643
on another highway job.

640
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:40,763
But each day seemed like forever.

641
01:01:40,788 --> 01:01:45,131
I was going crazy thinking of her
sleeping in the same bed as him.

642
01:01:45,417 --> 01:01:49,170
But Uriah, well, he needed me then...

643
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:52,038
just to get through the season.

644
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:56,928
But his mind was gone in all directions,
and all of them crooked.

645
01:01:57,553 --> 01:01:59,397
Suspicious of everything.

646
01:01:59,592 --> 01:02:03,475
What do you do when you're
down there in town, at night?

647
01:02:04,311 --> 01:02:06,522
There ain't too much going on.

648
01:02:07,006 --> 01:02:09,272
You got yourself a girl there?

649
01:02:09,842 --> 01:02:11,835
I'm just passing through.

650
01:02:13,002 --> 01:02:14,357
That's right.

651
01:02:14,827 --> 01:02:16,241
I forgot.

652
01:02:19,994 --> 01:02:21,986
Time was getting short.

653
01:02:22,752 --> 01:02:24,346
I knew that much.

654
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,892
Something was gonna happen.

655
01:02:28,773 --> 01:02:30,268
God damn it.

656
01:02:55,321 --> 01:02:56,508
Jesus.

657
01:02:57,485 --> 01:02:59,938
Thing went out of it's god damn mind.

658
01:03:00,178 --> 01:03:01,828
Came right at me.

659
01:03:03,352 --> 01:03:05,516
I think it's back is broken.

660
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:09,313
God damn dogs, you trust 'em...

661
01:03:09,509 --> 01:03:11,322
and they turn on ya.

662
01:03:13,262 --> 01:03:14,801
Help me bury it?

663
01:03:16,207 --> 01:03:20,989
Next day he got called away again
to work on the highway, just for a day.

664
01:03:21,661 --> 01:03:25,000
And I told her that was as good
as it was gonna get for us.

665
01:03:25,197 --> 01:03:26,786
So that was that.

666
01:03:27,631 --> 01:03:29,270
We was gonna go.

667
01:04:50,067 --> 01:04:51,700
Where you going?

668
01:04:52,303 --> 01:04:53,659
Nowhere.

669
01:04:54,282 --> 01:04:55,659
Nowhere?

670
01:04:57,925 --> 01:04:59,276
Nowhere.

671
01:05:00,459 --> 01:05:02,120
I love you, girl.

672
01:05:03,181 --> 01:05:04,848
Don't you know that?

673
01:05:06,327 --> 01:05:07,631
Don't ya?

674
01:05:08,927 --> 01:05:10,258
Yes.

675
01:05:11,172 --> 01:05:13,786
What do you wanna leave me for?

676
01:05:14,585 --> 01:05:16,094
I don't.

677
01:05:23,428 --> 01:05:25,921
Hurts me when you lie like that.

678
01:05:26,575 --> 01:05:29,132
You know how much?
- Uriah.

679
01:06:29,711 --> 01:06:32,555
He beat her bad enough to kill a man.

680
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:38,023
Broke her neck before he shot himself.

681
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:44,391
I wondered ever since
how that must've been.

682
01:06:45,352 --> 01:06:47,195
Her last breath.

683
01:06:48,055 --> 01:06:49,852
That pain.

684
01:06:50,898 --> 01:06:54,109
Police carried her body out
in a white sheet...

685
01:06:54,437 --> 01:06:56,124
stained red.

686
01:06:57,653 --> 01:06:59,621
Where the hell was I?

687
01:07:01,504 --> 01:07:03,471
Where in the hell was I?

688
01:07:05,299 --> 01:07:09,569
I can see her dying,
I can see her eyes staring at me...

689
01:07:11,316 --> 01:07:14,318
and I ain't man enough to save her.

690
01:07:31,129 --> 01:07:33,496
God damn it, where was I?

691
01:08:04,666 --> 01:08:07,564
You'd have done something for her
if you could.

692
01:08:07,776 --> 01:08:09,689
I know you would have.

693
01:08:10,759 --> 01:08:12,454
Tomorrow...

694
01:08:13,447 --> 01:08:16,876
you and me, we're gonna walk outta here.

695
01:08:17,782 --> 01:08:20,128
We're gonna leave it all behind us.

696
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:24,676
It ain't as easy as all that.

697
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:27,261
Well it ain't impossible neither.

698
01:08:28,045 --> 01:08:29,753
I'll help you.

699
01:08:31,002 --> 01:08:32,509
I'm sorry.

700
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:37,748
Every damn day of my life I'm sorry.

701
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,468
I wanna come home.

702
01:12:19,102 --> 01:12:21,773
I wanna come home.
- Ruth.

703
01:13:10,056 --> 01:13:11,189
Hello?

704
01:13:11,412 --> 01:13:13,278
Yes, thank you for calling.

705
01:13:13,303 --> 01:13:14,994
Well I was hoping...

706
01:13:19,723 --> 01:13:22,207
Well how far from the city are you?

707
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:33,685
Won't you sit down?

708
01:14:35,896 --> 01:14:37,982
I'm awful sorry about her.

709
01:14:38,576 --> 01:14:40,709
My brother loved her deeply.

710
01:14:42,646 --> 01:14:46,224
I don't know what you came here for
exactly, but...

711
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,993
I found these for you.

712
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,740
I thought you'd like to have 'em.

713
01:14:54,838 --> 01:14:57,143
I remember when she showed up.

714
01:14:57,510 --> 01:15:01,033
Uriah took her in
like some kind of lost kitten.

715
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:03,377
She looked like one too.

716
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:07,400
Skinny, broke...
run away from somewhere.

717
01:15:08,955 --> 01:15:10,768
He told me once...

718
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:13,966
that he knew she was too pretty to keep.

719
01:15:14,502 --> 01:15:17,924
Well, he went and married her
all the same.

720
01:15:24,946 --> 01:15:26,368
Too pretty.

721
01:15:27,908 --> 01:15:30,443
Young and wild is what she was.

722
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:37,071
I apologize for saying that.

723
01:15:37,341 --> 01:15:39,994
I don't mean anything against her.

724
01:15:52,135 --> 01:15:55,503
For two days I got no answer
on Uriah's phone.

725
01:15:57,847 --> 01:16:01,198
I told the neighbors to go by
and check the house.

726
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,909
They called me a few hours later,
told me what they found.

727
01:16:04,934 --> 01:16:06,754
I drove right over.

728
01:16:07,307 --> 01:16:09,300
Police didn't want me in.

729
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,206
Said it'd be more than I can take...

730
01:16:12,612 --> 01:16:14,104
to see it.

731
01:16:18,871 --> 01:16:21,138
Uriah was just a farm boy.

732
01:16:21,954 --> 01:16:25,829
Maybe he wasn't a genius,
but I never knew him to be cruel.

733
01:16:26,129 --> 01:16:27,543
Never once.

734
01:16:27,816 --> 01:16:29,727
Not to dogs neither.

735
01:16:30,025 --> 01:16:31,259
What?

736
01:16:31,716 --> 01:16:33,650
People change, ma'am.

737
01:16:34,429 --> 01:16:35,608
You think so?

738
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:37,164
To do what he did?

739
01:16:37,445 --> 01:16:39,037
What do you think he did?

740
01:16:39,195 --> 01:16:41,033
I know what he did.

741
01:16:41,443 --> 01:16:43,263
None of you knew my brother.

742
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:45,336
If you knew him at all...

743
01:16:45,618 --> 01:16:47,818
you would know he wasn't capable.

744
01:16:48,313 --> 01:16:51,018
Well if that's true,
then what did he do time for?

745
01:16:51,229 --> 01:16:54,074
Time, Uriah never did time.

746
01:16:54,433 --> 01:16:57,811
Maybe you didn't know your brother
as much as you thought.

747
01:16:58,053 --> 01:17:01,148
You think I don't know my own brother.

748
01:17:14,017 --> 01:17:16,352
I love you Miller.

749
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:36,420
Miller.

750
01:18:40,073 --> 01:18:42,249
What are you doing here?
I thought...

751
01:18:42,604 --> 01:18:45,757
I got everything packed up,
I was coming for ya.

752
01:18:47,492 --> 01:18:49,192
I can't no more.

753
01:18:50,551 --> 01:18:52,140
What do you mean?

754
01:18:52,703 --> 01:18:54,616
I love you, Miller...

755
01:18:55,468 --> 01:18:57,061
I truly do.

756
01:18:58,088 --> 01:18:59,937
I ain't going with you...

757
01:19:00,725 --> 01:19:02,037
I can't.

758
01:19:08,324 --> 01:19:09,755
Miller?

759
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,031
Miller?

760
01:19:48,947 --> 01:19:50,970
He do something to you?

761
01:19:54,745 --> 01:19:56,154
Well then...

762
01:19:56,623 --> 01:19:57,958
then what?

763
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:00,597
I'm expecting.

764
01:20:03,313 --> 01:20:05,383
Do you hear what I said?

765
01:20:06,035 --> 01:20:07,322
Well...

766
01:20:09,777 --> 01:20:12,713
Well so you are, that don't change
nothing between you and me.

767
01:20:12,738 --> 01:20:14,028
It changes everything.

768
01:20:14,053 --> 01:20:15,817
But, baby, I'm not the kind of man...

769
01:20:15,819 --> 01:20:18,122
who's just gonna run away on you.
You know that, don't you?

770
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:20,202
No, you got good intentions.

771
01:20:20,437 --> 01:20:21,725
But...

772
01:20:23,271 --> 01:20:24,721
it ain't yours.

773
01:20:46,308 --> 01:20:49,386
Well, wait a minute, you don't know that.

774
01:20:50,651 --> 01:20:53,456
No, this don't make no sense, you can't.

775
01:20:54,354 --> 01:20:56,815
Is it 'cause you're still fucking him?

776
01:20:57,839 --> 01:20:59,488
Are you still fucking him?
- He's my husband.

777
01:20:59,512 --> 01:21:01,518
There's no way you love that man.

778
01:21:01,776 --> 01:21:02,901
Look, we'll go...

779
01:21:02,926 --> 01:21:04,598
and we'll find some place to settle.
- Like where?

780
01:21:04,622 --> 01:21:07,917
Like somewhere, I don't know,
we'll figure it out.

781
01:21:09,526 --> 01:21:12,323
I'll take care of you, I swear I will.

782
01:21:12,658 --> 01:21:14,300
You're a good man...

783
01:21:15,363 --> 01:21:16,729
you are.

784
01:21:17,433 --> 01:21:19,050
One thing I know...

785
01:21:19,575 --> 01:21:22,520
a man won't ever
love another man's child.

786
01:21:23,182 --> 01:21:24,543
Gale, you...

787
01:21:26,186 --> 01:21:27,776
You hush your head.

788
01:21:28,026 --> 01:21:29,648
You know me, you know
I ain't the kind of man...

789
01:21:29,672 --> 01:21:31,638
It's decided, Miller.

790
01:21:33,367 --> 01:21:34,471
Who says it is?

791
01:21:34,496 --> 01:21:36,571
Stop, please!

792
01:21:36,596 --> 01:21:38,046
Wait, you can't go.

793
01:21:38,264 --> 01:21:41,801
Gale, wait...
God damn it, I said wait!

794
01:22:02,029 --> 01:22:03,548
You down here?

795
01:22:15,179 --> 01:22:16,491
Miller?

796
01:22:24,964 --> 01:22:26,885
You came back.

797
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:30,337
You scared me.

798
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:34,215
You been gone so long.

799
01:22:34,574 --> 01:22:37,240
I... I left you a note.

800
01:22:37,764 --> 01:22:39,943
I been to see Uriah's sister.

801
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:44,219
How come you went there?

802
01:22:44,829 --> 01:22:46,414
She called me.

803
01:22:47,805 --> 01:22:49,813
Well what did she want?

804
01:22:52,351 --> 01:22:53,601
Nothing.

805
01:22:54,355 --> 01:22:55,703
Nothing?

806
01:22:56,851 --> 01:23:00,089
She... I mean,
she's all confused.

807
01:23:00,422 --> 01:23:04,378
She said they found
my mama's body some days after.

808
01:23:05,156 --> 01:23:07,218
That ain't right though, 'cause...

809
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:10,445
you'd known right away
something happened to her.

810
01:23:10,703 --> 01:23:13,515
You wouldn't have left her there
like that.

811
01:23:14,062 --> 01:23:15,617
You wouldn't have.

812
01:23:21,363 --> 01:23:23,330
I got something for ya.

813
01:23:27,285 --> 01:23:28,873
That's hers.

814
01:23:29,781 --> 01:23:31,373
It's for you.

815
01:23:33,088 --> 01:23:34,684
I found it for you.

816
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:37,379
How'd you get it?

817
01:23:40,562 --> 01:23:41,910
Take it.

818
01:23:42,746 --> 01:23:44,522
Uriah's sister?

819
01:23:44,845 --> 01:23:47,431
She said he couldn't have done them things.

820
01:23:47,729 --> 01:23:51,539
I was thinking about what you said,
about the dog.

821
01:23:55,256 --> 01:23:58,816
Miller you...
you got them scars.

822
01:24:04,315 --> 01:24:05,727
No, he did it.

823
01:24:05,752 --> 01:24:07,539
God damn it, he did all of it.

824
01:24:07,564 --> 01:24:10,687
She loved me, she came
here to tell me, she...

825
01:24:12,869 --> 01:24:14,490
She loved me.

826
01:24:14,851 --> 01:24:16,318
Where, Miller?

827
01:24:17,115 --> 01:24:18,576
Where was she?

828
01:24:19,458 --> 01:24:20,859
Was she here?

829
01:24:21,078 --> 01:24:22,538
In this room?

830
01:24:23,345 --> 01:24:24,773
Where!

831
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,666
There.

832
01:24:30,527 --> 01:24:32,535
She was standing right there.

833
01:24:32,863 --> 01:24:34,630
What happened then?

834
01:24:37,494 --> 01:24:39,665
What happened then!

835
01:24:42,682 --> 01:24:44,464
I took hold of her.

836
01:24:45,316 --> 01:24:47,807
I just wanted her to see sense.

837
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:50,576
She hit me, hard, and...

838
01:24:54,138 --> 01:24:55,453
I...

839
01:24:58,420 --> 01:25:00,454
I'm somewhere else.

840
01:25:37,747 --> 01:25:41,958
There's blood spreading out
around her head like a halo.

841
01:25:44,607 --> 01:25:48,287
I had to stop her blood from spilling.
I... I couldn't stop it.

842
01:25:49,901 --> 01:25:51,364
I loved her.

843
01:25:52,707 --> 01:25:54,820
I loved her so much, I...

844
01:26:19,692 --> 01:26:21,942
No, it's all wrong I did not do that!

845
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:25,496
No, she couldn't have been bleeding here.
I mean, why would she do that?

846
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:29,014
No, she was bleeding up there,
at that house.

847
01:26:30,412 --> 01:26:33,272
Up there where her husband killed her.
He did it!

848
01:26:33,687 --> 01:26:35,354
The fucking killer!

849
01:26:36,272 --> 01:26:39,746
The fucking murderer!
He's gonna pay for what he done.

850
01:26:40,021 --> 01:26:42,758
What did he do?

851
01:26:43,422 --> 01:26:45,406
What did he do?

852
01:26:46,157 --> 01:26:49,266
Damn it, Miller! What did he do!
- He took her.

853
01:26:50,286 --> 01:26:52,087
He took her away f...

854
01:26:54,810 --> 01:26:56,247
He took her.

855
01:26:56,513 --> 01:26:57,856
Gale.

856
01:27:01,084 --> 01:27:02,324
Gale?

857
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:05,222
Oh, Jesus.

858
01:27:06,296 --> 01:27:07,621
Gale.

859
01:27:36,531 --> 01:27:38,118
All this time.

860
01:27:40,515 --> 01:27:44,465
You let everyone believe.

861
01:27:47,974 --> 01:27:49,655
I ain't that man, I...

862
01:27:49,905 --> 01:27:51,244
I ain't.

863
01:27:51,499 --> 01:27:53,317
It ain't me no more.

864
01:27:54,330 --> 01:27:55,954
It ain't me not more.

865
01:27:56,251 --> 01:27:58,012
Don't be scared of me.

866
01:27:58,301 --> 01:28:00,412
D... don't be scared of me.

867
01:28:00,706 --> 01:28:02,324
She ain't dead.

868
01:28:02,637 --> 01:28:03,980
She's here.

869
01:28:04,786 --> 01:28:07,079
She's right her, I see her.

870
01:28:07,985 --> 01:28:11,084
What are you doing, where you going?

871
01:28:11,086 --> 01:28:13,260
Y... you said we was gonna
go away, you said that.

872
01:28:13,285 --> 01:28:15,817
You stay away form me!
- What, you wanna leave me?

873
01:28:15,842 --> 01:28:18,659
You bastard, you god damn bastard!

874
01:28:18,684 --> 01:28:21,380
You said you was gonna help me.
- Oh god.

875
01:28:21,405 --> 01:28:23,012
That what you want?

876
01:28:23,276 --> 01:28:25,042
You gonna leave me?

877
01:28:26,295 --> 01:28:28,008
Answer me, Gale.

878
01:28:32,481 --> 01:28:34,361
Answer me!

879
01:28:39,432 --> 01:28:40,850
I don't.

880
01:28:44,497 --> 01:28:47,067
I swear, I don't.

881
01:28:48,197 --> 01:28:50,283
Please, Miller.

882
01:28:54,219 --> 01:28:55,856
Please!

883
01:29:02,296 --> 01:29:04,031
I wanna stay.

884
01:29:06,358 --> 01:29:07,992
I'll stay...

885
01:29:08,477 --> 01:29:09,992
with you.

886
01:29:11,761 --> 01:29:13,501
I want to.

887
01:29:24,397 --> 01:29:26,867
I'm begging you to forgive me.

888
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,673
Please?

889
01:29:31,142 --> 01:29:32,564
Forgive me.

890
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:38,491
I love you, Miller.

891
01:29:41,089 --> 01:29:42,684
I truly do.

892
01:30:57,447 --> 01:30:59,372
Where are you, girl?

893
01:31:12,934 --> 01:31:14,864
Baby, where'd you go?

894
01:31:21,437 --> 01:31:23,202
Where are you, girl?

895
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:50,132
Don't go, Gale.

896
01:31:54,430 --> 01:31:56,015
Gale, don't go.

897
01:31:58,946 --> 01:32:00,904
Gale, please don't go.

898
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:51,998
Lord, I've gotten old.

899
01:32:52,328 --> 01:32:54,186
I'm retiring this year, you know.

900
01:32:54,211 --> 01:32:58,874
My wife says she want's
to see Alaska while we can still walk.

901
01:32:59,444 --> 01:33:02,772
She sure has put up with
a lot over these years.

902
01:33:03,844 --> 01:33:07,706
As far as this situation,
you can go on like you please.

903
01:33:08,018 --> 01:33:10,371
I guess you got what you came for.

904
01:33:10,827 --> 01:33:12,918
I don't really feel that way.

905
01:33:15,242 --> 01:33:17,672
What if I never showed up here?

906
01:33:18,341 --> 01:33:19,838
I mean...

907
01:33:20,185 --> 01:33:24,072
what if he'd just gone on living there,
keeping to himself?

908
01:33:25,354 --> 01:33:27,729
Well, I don't know.

909
01:33:28,933 --> 01:33:31,276
That sound like justice to you?
