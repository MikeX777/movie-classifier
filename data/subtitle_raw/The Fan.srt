1
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:46,318
I'm offered two and six
for this handsome trophy.

2
00:01:46,352 --> 00:01:47,620
Do I hear another bid?

3
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:51,651
It's going for two and six
to the party in the checkered scarf.

4
00:01:52,576 --> 00:01:55,251
Next, lot 177.

5
00:01:56,543 --> 00:01:57,624
What have we here?

6
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,012
One mother-of-pearl box, inlaid,

7
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:02,883
containing a fan.

8
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:05,943
Here's a beauty for you!

9
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:11,500
Regency period, AlenÃ§on lace
mounted on carved ivory sticks.

10
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:14,195
Absolutely perfect condition.

11
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:18,445
You'd never know that Jerry
had dropped his filthy bombs near it.

12
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:20,986
What's the bid
for this veritable treasure?

13
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:24,484
Wallington Limited.
There it is, right there.

14
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,845
The stamp of one of
England's most refined jewelers.

15
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:31,645
Think of a noble lady, all done up
in her silks and her settings

16
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:33,879
that must have held this in her delicate
hands

17
00:02:34,395 --> 00:02:36,211
or waved it at her noble Lord.

18
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:39,489
Oh, here's a name on it. Margaret.

19
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,242
Now there's a real lady's name for you.

20
00:02:42,604 --> 00:02:45,285
Come up, come up.
Don't be frightened of the aristocracy.

21
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:47,925
This here is more
than an object of beauty.

22
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,524
It's genuine necessity, it's what
every English home needs this winter.

23
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:53,805
Something to set up a nice cool breeze.

24
00:02:55,445 --> 00:02:57,125
- Twelve shillings.
- Fifteen.

25
00:02:57,325 --> 00:02:58,354
Eighteen.

26
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:00,173
Eighteen shillings?

27
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:03,605
I'm an auctioneer, not Father Christmas.
Who will give a proper bid?

28
00:03:03,765 --> 00:03:06,445
- Young man.
- How much, madam?

29
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:09,405
I have no intention of bidding.

30
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,397
Why should I?
It's my own fan.

31
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:16,805
Madam, this here is a piece
of unclaimed property

32
00:03:16,965 --> 00:03:20,125
salvaged from blitz buildings
to be publicly sold.

33
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:22,924
Well, it isn't any more
because I'm claiming it now.

34
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:24,685
You should have thought
of that sooner.

35
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:26,852
These lots have been on view
for the past month.

36
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,545
Come on,
I made a bid of 18 shillings.

37
00:03:29,578 --> 00:03:32,979
All right, 18 shillings for the gentleman
with the big heart.

38
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,205
Do I hear a pound?

39
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:38,004
What are you talking about?
The fan is mine.

40
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:41,765
You really can't stand there selling things
that don't belong to you.

41
00:03:41,925 --> 00:03:44,792
How do I know the fan is yours?

42
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,887
Well, I... I told you so.

43
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:51,486
- Oh, come off it, madam.
- I shall be delighted to have it back.

44
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,884
It's been stored at Edwards's for years
while I've been travelling.

45
00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:57,245
That's right, you know.
There was a direct hit on Edwards's.

46
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:59,885
Come on, we haven't got all day.

47
00:04:00,045 --> 00:04:02,405
Madam, can you furnish
any proof of ownership?

48
00:04:02,564 --> 00:04:06,120
- Have you got a bill for this fan?
- Of course not, it was a gift.

49
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,901
You'll find me always cheerful
and willing to oblige.

50
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:10,624
I'll put the fan aside for a day.

51
00:04:10,804 --> 00:04:14,245
If you bring in someone who knows you
and knows it's yours, you can have it.

52
00:04:14,445 --> 00:04:18,565
That's quite absurd. Everyone I once
knew in London must be dead by now.

53
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:22,165
Sorry, madam, but you must find
someone to establish proof.

54
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:25,425
Madam, would you fill in this form,
please? That is the law.

55
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:29,105
I'm sure it is -
it's quite inconvenient enough to be.

56
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:30,028
Next...

57
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:09,994
Would you be good enough to tell me,
is Lord Darlington still alive?

58
00:05:10,028 --> 00:05:12,605
- He sure is.
- Oh, you're an American.

59
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:15,710
I spent many years
in your stimulating country.

60
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:18,365
I get along very well with Americans.

61
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:22,605
After you've married one or two of them,
they don't seem like foreigners at all.

62
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:27,405
- Does Lord Darlington live here?
- Oh yes, we all do.

63
00:05:27,604 --> 00:05:29,745
Oh, how picturesque.

64
00:05:32,805 --> 00:05:34,645
This is the drawing room.

65
00:05:35,844 --> 00:05:37,884
There is the dining room.

66
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:43,685
There's the chandelier.

67
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:49,684
And there is the painting
over the fireplace.

68
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:55,310
And you, young ladies,
you are perhaps, um...

69
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:57,072
descendants?

70
00:05:57,105 --> 00:06:00,485
I hadn't known that Lord Darlington
had ever visited America.

71
00:06:00,645 --> 00:06:02,675
Oh no, we just rent our rooms here.

72
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:06,929
Oh, forgive me.
I've been away for so long.

73
00:06:06,962 --> 00:06:10,205
It's rather startling to find
Lord Darlington letting lodgings.

74
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:12,547
Don't you know
there's a housing shortage?

75
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:17,085
This is an office now.
And just what office is this?

76
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:21,364
We work for an organization in the
States that sends food to people here.

77
00:06:21,524 --> 00:06:25,364
I knew you were nice girls
the moment I laid eyes on you.

78
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:29,400
And does Lord Darlington
have an office here too?

79
00:06:29,434 --> 00:06:31,501
Oh no, his rooms are
the way they always were.

80
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:34,706
Poor old guy, how could he live
any other way? He's a museum piece.

81
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:36,345
A museum piece?

82
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:39,938
My dears, Lord Darlington was once
the most dangerous man in London.

83
00:06:41,045 --> 00:06:44,325
- Is he at home now?
- He never goes out before three.

84
00:06:45,532 --> 00:06:46,538
Do you want to see him?

85
00:06:47,005 --> 00:06:48,498
- Yes, please.
- Sure.

86
00:06:49,764 --> 00:06:51,591
Oh, who shall I say?

87
00:06:52,405 --> 00:06:56,335
- Just tell him a very dear old enemy.
- Okay.

88
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,402
- Hi, sweet.
- Good afternoon, my dear.

89
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:12,560
You're looking like a...
No, not at all like a rose.

90
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:15,645
You're looking like
an extremely healthy sunflower.

91
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:19,005
You know what? There's a lady
waiting downstairs to see you.

92
00:07:19,165 --> 00:07:23,644
- Indeed? What is her name?
- She said she was a dear old enemy.

93
00:07:23,845 --> 00:07:26,485
Extraordinary,
I didn't know I had any of them left.

94
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:28,444
Hope she doesn't keep me too long.

95
00:07:29,605 --> 00:07:32,004
Enemies' conversations
are interminable -

96
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:34,045
friends get it over in a minute.

97
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,245
This is the hour for my walk.

98
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:39,885
Here's your little gloves.

99
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:42,005
Here's your little cane.

100
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:43,925
Here's your little hat.

101
00:07:44,084 --> 00:07:47,725
My dear, somehow I believe
my accessories are the normal size.

102
00:07:47,924 --> 00:07:51,685
- There. Are you okay now?
- I'm quite, as you say, okay.

103
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:04,565
Why, it is Lord Darlington!

104
00:08:06,525 --> 00:08:08,970
Don't you remember me, Robert?

105
00:08:10,725 --> 00:08:13,965
You must forgive me, madam,
but I have such a wretched memory.

106
00:08:14,124 --> 00:08:17,925
Of course. At our age
we remember only ourselves.

107
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:21,845
But, don't you? Can't you?

108
00:08:22,005 --> 00:08:24,725
Please make me young again
by telling me your name.

109
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:29,725
<i>Hey Cynthia, have you got what came
down from Liverpool this morning?</i>

110
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,924
You cannot expect me to refresh
my memory in this mad house,

111
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:36,565
- so if you will pardon me...
- Pardon you?

112
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:40,724
I'll do much better than that.
I'll accompany you.

113
00:08:46,445 --> 00:08:50,405
Of course it was my vanity that
made me think you'd recognize me today

114
00:08:50,565 --> 00:08:52,965
when yesterday was so very long ago.

115
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:56,290
Madam, I regret that
I'm contributing very little to the situation

116
00:08:56,386 --> 00:08:58,447
and I'm pressed for time
so if you'd be good enough

117
00:08:58,481 --> 00:09:00,594
to tell me who you are...
- Oh, come Robert.

118
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:01,942
Why don't you try and guess?

119
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:04,249
I am sorry,
but I have no fondness for games.

120
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:14,287
Good afternoon, m'lord.
Here it is, ready and waiting for you.

121
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,917
- I'm a bit late today.
- Oh, it's still fine and fresh, sir.

122
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,093
Who else but Robert Darlington would
wear primroses in this day and age?

123
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:23,993
Oh, you're quite perfect!

124
00:09:24,027 --> 00:09:27,140
That is perhaps debatable.
I haven't got time to argue it with you.

125
00:09:27,174 --> 00:09:29,006
What is it you want of me, madam?

126
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,751
A little attention, to begin with.

127
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:33,108
You might at least ask me how I am.

128
00:09:33,142 --> 00:09:35,598
I never ask people that question.
They might tell me.

129
00:09:35,631 --> 00:09:38,527
If it hadn't been for the fan,
I wouldn't have dreamed of looking you up.

130
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,676
But those idiots say that I can't have it

131
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:43,778
unless I bring in someone who knows me
and knows about the fan.

132
00:09:43,812 --> 00:09:46,248
What idiots? Bring in where?
What fan?

133
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:48,378
Why, Lady Windermere's fan!

134
00:09:51,565 --> 00:09:53,090
How do you know that name?

135
00:09:53,123 --> 00:09:55,428
That's one name you remember,
isn't it Robert?

136
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:57,340
Because you loved her.

137
00:09:57,925 --> 00:10:01,137
No man ever loved her as you did,
except her husband.

138
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:02,647
I think you've said enough.

139
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:07,517
- And assumed entirely too much.
- You wear them every day, don't you?

140
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,874
She was so much like a primrose herself.

141
00:10:10,405 --> 00:10:13,222
So fresh, so exquisite, so innocent.

142
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:18,325
Who would have thought that you and I
would survive her and him?

143
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:21,800
They went together, he and she,
when the first bombs fell.

144
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:25,565
And that was best.
One could not live without the other.

145
00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:30,724
I saw their graves.
There were primroses on hers.

146
00:10:30,884 --> 00:10:33,642
- Please...
- You see, I loved her too.

147
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:37,292
And so I was glad
that you could not have your wish.

148
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:40,539
That you could not destroy
the happiness of her marriage.

149
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,490
I will not have you speak
to me this way.

150
00:10:43,524 --> 00:10:47,261
I have never seen you before, I do not
know you and I have no wish to.

151
00:10:51,965 --> 00:10:53,876
Indeed, you have seen me before.

152
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,418
I can show you the place
where you first saw me.

153
00:10:56,663 --> 00:10:57,628
This shop!

154
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:00,159
Television?

155
00:11:00,197 --> 00:11:02,567
It was once Wallington's,
the jewelers.

156
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,716
That was before the First World War.

157
00:11:04,908 --> 00:11:07,008
Dear man, it was before the Boer War.

158
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:09,498
It was on a beautiful spring day,

159
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,145
but it was not a very happy day for me.

160
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:15,881
I had no money left,
simply no money at all.

161
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:20,631
In my hotel suite,
the bills were piled like snow drifts.

162
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:23,845
'I'd known other times like it before

163
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:27,780
<i>but it's curious how one
never gets used to destitution.</i>

164
00:11:28,005 --> 00:11:32,017
<i>That day, I'd come to Wallington's
to sell my sapphire earrings.</i>

165
00:11:32,227 --> 00:11:33,471
Pardon me, gentlemen.

166
00:11:34,216 --> 00:11:35,777
May I fetch someone to serve you?

167
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:37,911
No thank you, not yet. I...

168
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:40,307
I want to look at
your charming frivolities.

169
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:44,540
Every thread
of the AlenÃ§on lace is perfect

170
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:47,167
and the design
is extraordinarily delicate.

171
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:48,222
She must have it, Arthur.

172
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:51,102
I think she will be delighted.
I'm glad you told me about this, Cecil.

173
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:54,404
It's the perfect tribute to an enchanting
wife from an enchanted husband.

174
00:11:54,469 --> 00:11:56,371
Really, Cecil. What a salesman
you would have made.

175
00:11:56,765 --> 00:11:58,527
What a salesman you make!

176
00:11:58,804 --> 00:12:02,289
If I may say so, Lord Windermere,
you're wise to be guided by Mr. Graham.

177
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:03,925
His taste is faultless.

178
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,068
Robert, the only way a poor
man can indulge his taste

179
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:09,153
is by selling it.

180
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:11,909
Your wit is improving, Cecil.

181
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:13,781
I'm entirely persuaded.
I shall take the fan.

182
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:17,965
You should have your wife's name
on the fan to make it more personal.

183
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:19,394
A most thoughtful touch.

184
00:12:19,605 --> 00:12:21,609
- How would you do that?
- Something very delicate...

185
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:24,285
Rubies.
An exquisite tracery of rubies.

186
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,525
- That's it.
- Excellent. Her name is Margaret.

187
00:12:26,685 --> 00:12:28,844
- And her birthday should be on it too.
- Very good.

188
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:31,444
It's the 24th of April
and be sure to have it done in time.

189
00:12:31,605 --> 00:12:34,885
- She'll want it at her birthday ball.
- It will be finished in ample time.

190
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,477
- Good afternoon then.
- Good day.

191
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:42,805
- May I be of service, madam?
- Lord Windermere is mistaken.

192
00:12:42,964 --> 00:12:45,205
Lady Windermere's birthday
is the 21st of April.

193
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:48,565
- Lord Windermere said the 24th.
- I just told you he was mistaken.

194
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:51,204
You must remind him that he is wrong
as soon as possible.

195
00:12:51,365 --> 00:12:54,045
Certainly. If you say so, madam.
But I can't help thinking

196
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:56,124
that Lord Windermere
would know better than anybody.

197
00:12:56,285 --> 00:12:59,925
Not better than anybody.
Her birthday is the 21st.

198
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:03,365
Oh, I'm sorry. I came to see Wallington
for a moment. Of course I'll wait.

199
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:05,805
There's no need to.
I'm glad of a bit more time.

200
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:09,005
There are too many lovely things here
for me to make up my mind quickly.

201
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,401
Thank you for your most
altruistic indecision.

202
00:13:12,805 --> 00:13:13,814
I think...

203
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:18,606
my idea of having rubies on the fan
should be worth ten pounds more.

204
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,732
I think five pounds is sufficient,
Mr. Graham.

205
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,742
I was going to bring in the Duchess
of Berwick to see the emeralds.

206
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:26,783
Very well, ten pounds, Mr. Graham.

207
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:29,841
Thank heavens, I remembered in time.

208
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,085
My wife's birthday
isn't the 24th, it's the 21st.

209
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:33,798
I already know, m'lord.

210
00:13:33,832 --> 00:13:36,657
This lady was kind enough
to inform me of the correct date.

211
00:13:37,365 --> 00:13:40,576
I'm sorry, I couldn't help hearing.

212
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:44,770
- I'm so glad you did, thank you.
- Perhaps you wonder how I knew.

213
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:48,291
Well, my most innocent vice
is reading the news of London society.

214
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:51,488
There's been so much about Lady
Windermere's birthday ball on the 21st.

215
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:53,732
Of course,
the 24th is our wedding anniversary.

216
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:56,921
My memory is always
in a state of confusion about dates.

217
00:13:57,685 --> 00:14:01,013
I'm afraid it's even gone
into a confused state about names.

218
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:03,956
You cannot blame your memory
for something that was never in it.

219
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,038
My name is Mrs. Erlynne,
but you don't know me.

220
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:08,129
- But I do know you, I'm sure.
- No.

221
00:14:08,163 --> 00:14:09,982
Perhaps Lord Windermere
wishes that he did.

222
00:14:10,365 --> 00:14:12,616
- You came back too, Cecil.
- Why, certainly!

223
00:14:13,005 --> 00:14:16,244
I thought of taking another look at some
of Wallington's precious little trinkets.

224
00:14:16,573 --> 00:14:18,592
- I'm sure we have met.
- No, Lord Windermere.

225
00:14:18,685 --> 00:14:21,296
I'm positive.
There's something about you...

226
00:14:21,965 --> 00:14:23,870
I know this isn't the first time
I've seen you.

227
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:28,323
- And I hope it won't be the last.
- I've just decided to stay in London.

228
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:31,100
They say it's a very small place.
I hope it's true.

229
00:14:31,365 --> 00:14:35,453
How remarkable that we should meet again
so soon, and in the same company.

230
00:14:35,487 --> 00:14:37,300
I dare say you left a glove, Robert.

231
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,408
- Of course.
- But you've got both gloves on.

232
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:41,005
I carry a third glove to leave behind,

233
00:14:41,165 --> 00:14:43,085
then I can return
and find out how my friends

234
00:14:43,285 --> 00:14:45,885
have been improving their opportunities
behind my back.

235
00:14:46,045 --> 00:14:47,805
They really don't deserve it,
Mrs. Erlynne,

236
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:49,844
but let me present.
Lord Darlington, Mr. Graham.

237
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:51,845
The two best dressed men in London.

238
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:53,804
But there is a difference between us,
Mrs. Erlynne.

239
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:56,004
You see, I live by my wits.

240
00:14:56,165 --> 00:14:59,085
Lord Darlington is a much more
usual type. He lives on his money.

241
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:01,288
The witty so often
undervalue the rich

242
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:02,777
and vice-versa.

243
00:15:03,365 --> 00:15:05,611
The settings on my earrings
are rather loose.

244
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:07,780
Will you have them tightened,
and send them over to me?

245
00:15:08,045 --> 00:15:11,779
- To Mrs. Erlynne, Albemarle Hotel.
- Yes, madam.

246
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:12,920
Good afternoon.

247
00:15:15,885 --> 00:15:19,805
<i>No, I didn't sell
my earrings after all.</i>

248
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,612
<i>It, shall we say, came over me</i>

249
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:25,719
<i>that it was not going to be necessary
to part with them.</i>

250
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:30,125
<i>I knew one of you three men
would solve my problem.'</i>

251
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,139
Is her ladyship at home, Dawson?

252
00:15:42,173 --> 00:15:44,781
- Yes, m'lord, in the ballroom.
- In the ballroom?

253
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:09,578
Will you please get down
before I have heart failure?

254
00:16:09,612 --> 00:16:12,284
I'm measuring how much garland
I'll need for the decorating.

255
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:16,443
I greatly admire your slender white neck.
It would grieve me to see it broken.

256
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:21,724
Darling, I wasn't in the slightest danger.
But it is sweet of you to worry.

257
00:16:21,925 --> 00:16:24,896
Purely selfish. I'd hate to have
anything happen to you.

258
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:29,160
We've been married nearly a year and
I'm in the habit of having you for a wife.

259
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:32,124
Margaret, why won't you let people
do things for you?

260
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,925
- Must you do everything yourself?
- I love it.

261
00:16:34,084 --> 00:16:36,885
What's the hurry with the garlands?
There's still three weeks before the ball.

262
00:16:37,045 --> 00:16:39,725
I'm so excited. I think I'm going
to have the most beautiful birthday.

263
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:42,085
Your birthday is the greatest day
of history for me.

264
00:16:42,245 --> 00:16:44,405
Thank you so much
for having been born.

265
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:48,045
- Dawson?
- Yes, m'lady?

266
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:49,965
- Is the tea ready, Dawson?
- Yes, m'lady.

267
00:16:50,124 --> 00:16:51,644
Would you bring it in?

268
00:16:53,765 --> 00:16:56,805
Here's a new offence. You've been
addressing these invitations yourself.

269
00:16:56,965 --> 00:17:00,525
- The secretary could have done it.
- It's my birthday, it's my party.

270
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:03,405
They're my invitations
and I love it this way.

271
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,885
- Oh, what's Lord Darlington's address?
- Half Moon Street.

272
00:17:07,045 --> 00:17:09,405
- What number?
- Just Half Moon Street will reach him.

273
00:17:09,565 --> 00:17:12,125
- That will be all, Dawson.
- Just London would for that matter.

274
00:17:12,285 --> 00:17:15,165
You didn't show me the announcement
of your birthday ball in the society news.

275
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,965
Why, there hasn't been any.
This is to be our own very small party.

276
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:22,218
- Are you sure there was nothing?
- Quite. I hate that sort of thing.

277
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:25,675
My aunt always said a lady should have
her name in the papers only three times.

278
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:28,105
When she's born,
when she's married and when she dies.

279
00:17:28,124 --> 00:17:30,965
I was particularly careful
to avoid any report of our ball.

280
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,565
So there was nothing about
the ball in the papers.

281
00:17:33,725 --> 00:17:35,509
<i>Yes, this was their house.</i>

282
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,340
This was where they were happy.

283
00:17:38,374 --> 00:17:43,070
My dear lady, you've painted a very
pretty little picture of domestic bliss.

284
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,037
Arthur told me about it.

285
00:17:45,071 --> 00:17:47,820
Now I'm supposed to imagine
an intimate little supper

286
00:17:47,854 --> 00:17:51,245
with Windermere pouring out all his
confidences as well as the champagne?

287
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:55,535
Oh, no. Nothing half so formal.
He told me on one of his visits.

288
00:17:55,805 --> 00:17:59,936
As a matter of fact, he called on me
at the Albemarle the very next afternoon.

289
00:17:59,969 --> 00:18:04,043
- Windermere, the model husband
- Windermere, the model husband.

290
00:18:04,077 --> 00:18:07,264
And you have accused ME
of trying to destroy their marriage?

291
00:18:07,297 --> 00:18:08,765
I wanted to keep that marriage happy.

292
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:11,574
Madam, it does no good
to stir up these things.

293
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:14,001
Dead scandals have earned
the peace of their graves.

294
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:16,434
Here is where we really must part.

295
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,304
- Good afternoon, m'lord.
- I'm seven minutes late.

296
00:18:33,337 --> 00:18:36,857
I was unavoidably detained
by an absolutely unforeseen occurrence.

297
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,617
We are quite ready for you, m'lord.

298
00:18:38,725 --> 00:18:42,195
I cannot get used
to this strange new world.

299
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:44,902
The streets of London
are positively unsafe.

300
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,971
In broad daylight, one is badgered
by all sorts of insistent females

301
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,257
full of memories.

302
00:18:50,485 --> 00:18:51,969
One is literally pursued.

303
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:00,233
Thank you, Simpson.

304
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:04,936
May I be of service, madam?

305
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:06,713
Lord Darlington is in there, isn't he?

306
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,455
- Really, madam, I...
- I want to talk to him at once.

307
00:19:09,488 --> 00:19:11,218
This is most irregular, madam.

308
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:13,391
Madam, is there no place sacred?

309
00:19:13,424 --> 00:19:16,716
Not when I want something,
and I want my fan, Robert.

310
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:18,285
I must ask you again...

311
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:20,405
I've told madam
this is unprecedented...

312
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:24,525
Please leave us,
we are very old friends.

313
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:25,960
Come along, Robert.

314
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:28,759
Come and verify my statement
and then I can have my fan back.

315
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,768
I can verify nothing for you.

316
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,236
But of course you can

317
00:19:32,418 --> 00:19:34,239
when I help you
to remember a little more.

318
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:37,115
- Do you smoke?
- No thank you.

319
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:38,585
It may clear you memory.

320
00:19:39,922 --> 00:19:41,277
No thank you, madam.

321
00:19:42,684 --> 00:19:44,364
Please don't trouble,
let me light it.

322
00:19:47,764 --> 00:19:51,247
- It's good of you to permit me to smoke.
- Will you permit me?

323
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:54,618
Do you enjoy it?

324
00:19:55,805 --> 00:19:59,657
Not a bit, but I enjoy
the outraged looks on people's faces.

325
00:19:59,964 --> 00:20:01,550
Including yours, Lord Windermere.

326
00:20:02,138 --> 00:20:03,944
I'm not at all outraged, Mrs. Erlynne.

327
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:06,297
I find your vices most fascinating.

328
00:20:07,765 --> 00:20:11,484
For instance, I could find no reference
to my wife's birthday in the...

329
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:16,325
...in the society news.
- I lie so clumsily.

330
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,900
I can't imagine your doing anything
any way but gracefully.

331
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:22,980
You wonder, don't you,
how I knew about your wife's birthday?

332
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:26,047
- Of course, I came here to ask you.
- I'm indebted to your curiosity.

333
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:28,902
But you must let me stay
clothed in mystery.

334
00:20:28,935 --> 00:20:32,045
Mystery is a most important garment
in the wardrobe of an adventuress.

335
00:20:33,085 --> 00:20:35,747
- Adventuress?
- Yes, does the word shock you?

336
00:20:36,164 --> 00:20:38,485
To me it only means
one who loves adventure.

337
00:20:38,644 --> 00:20:40,214
You must have had many of them.

338
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:43,485
In Paris, Constantinople,
Cairo to Shanghai.

339
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:45,180
Oh yes, there were quite a few.

340
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:48,478
Although they were all
of a certain sameness.

341
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:50,401
I'm ready for a different sort.

342
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:52,877
I've decided to try
the most challenging of all.

343
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,602
The adventure of making a place
for myself in London society.

344
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:58,273
A beautiful woman alone?
The odds are against you.

345
00:20:58,445 --> 00:20:59,965
Yes, a hundred to one.

346
00:21:00,062 --> 00:21:00,925
But they're the kind of odds
I prefer. Don't you?

347
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:06,032
- You appeal to my sporting sense.
- I know, I meant to.

348
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:09,826
- How will you make your start?
- I thought you'd tell me that.

349
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:12,901
- Well, be seen at the opera.
- Splendid, I'm so fond of the opera.

350
00:21:12,935 --> 00:21:15,204
The singing never interferes
with the conversation.

351
00:21:15,245 --> 00:21:17,205
May I help to see that you get
a box for the season?

352
00:21:17,365 --> 00:21:19,594
- Naturally.
- And you should go to the races.

353
00:21:20,005 --> 00:21:23,333
I'm not so fond of racing.
I never gamble except with my future.

354
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:26,384
Besides, racing is for the many.
I want something more difficult.

355
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,012
I want to start right in
with the... favored few.

356
00:21:29,124 --> 00:21:30,787
That is decidedly the more difficult.

357
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:32,830
Still it can be done.
With your aid of course.

358
00:21:33,445 --> 00:21:35,603
Look, here's the kind of thing I mean.

359
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:39,439
The finals of the Mask and Foil Club
on Saturday next at Temple Gardens.

360
00:21:39,605 --> 00:21:41,978
Now, the Mask and Foil Club
is ideally select.

361
00:21:42,012 --> 00:21:44,211
Besides I love to watch fencing.
Are you a contestant?

362
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:46,725
No, I'm the referee. Cecil Graham
and Lord Darlington are the finalists.

363
00:21:46,885 --> 00:21:49,307
Mr. Graham told me
when he called this morning.

364
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:52,779
If Cecil is that quick at the tournament,
Darlington had best look to his laurels.

365
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:56,164
It should be a splendid match.
Is Lady Windermere going?

366
00:21:57,565 --> 00:22:01,374
Mrs. Erlynne, I'm afraid it's almost
impossible for you to go to the fencing.

367
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,685
- Almost impossible?
- The tickets are reserved for members.

368
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:09,675
Yes, but surely you could arrange that
a... shall we say, friend, could come?

369
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:12,821
Well, you see...
it's a matter of subscription.

370
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:16,221
It's a very old club and they're quite strict
about these things.

371
00:22:17,165 --> 00:22:20,939
In short, you don't think
an adventuress would belong there.

372
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:23,140
No, no. I...

373
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:25,672
I didn't say any such thing.

374
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:30,367
Yes you did, dear Lord Windermere.
You said it in all sorts of languages.

375
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:34,350
I... I think I should go now.

376
00:22:40,045 --> 00:22:42,832
I still don't know
how you knew my wife's birthday.

377
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:45,634
I'm glad. I keep my mystery.

378
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,630
You're very kind
to have let me stay so long.

379
00:22:52,045 --> 00:22:54,679
- I've made you keep someone waiting.
- Oh no, you haven't.

380
00:22:54,765 --> 00:22:57,496
They're my own inventions.
I always keep them inside

381
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,817
so that when a gentleman calls they
provide an opening for a conversation.

382
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:02,349
We didn't need one, did we?

383
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,768
- I hope we meet again soon.
- I'm sure we shall.

384
00:23:04,965 --> 00:23:08,199
Probably at the fencing match,
Lord Windermere. Good afternoon.

385
00:23:17,717 --> 00:23:19,546
I'm heartbroken
to have kept you waiting,

386
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,245
but business matters,
you know how they are.

387
00:23:21,405 --> 00:23:24,403
Or rather, I hope you will never
need to know, Lord Adolphus.

388
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:27,785
Augustus, dear lady, Augustus.
Augustus Lorton.

389
00:23:27,818 --> 00:23:29,967
Yes, of course.
How could I have confused it

390
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:32,181
when Augustus has always been
one of my favorite names?

391
00:23:32,293 --> 00:23:35,244
There's something so regal,
so Roman Empire about it, it suits you.

392
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:36,953
You were saying when my...

393
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,806
my matter of business interrupted us?

394
00:23:39,564 --> 00:23:43,726
I'm so fortunate in having this letter of
introduction to you from Mr. Whistler.

395
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,693
Oh yes, Mr. Whistler.
What a dear disagreeable man.

396
00:23:47,405 --> 00:23:49,647
This is the sketch he did
for the 'Lady in Silver' -

397
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,270
his portrait of me done years ago...
too many years ago!

398
00:23:55,604 --> 00:23:56,933
Dear Jimmy.

399
00:23:58,132 --> 00:23:59,441
I so wish I could paint.

400
00:23:59,474 --> 00:24:01,719
Oh, there are always
such quantities of artists.

401
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:05,047
You, I'm sure, have rarer gifts.
I know you're someone famous.

402
00:24:05,165 --> 00:24:08,321
Where is it I saw your name
in print only lately?

403
00:24:08,924 --> 00:24:10,055
Oh, I know!

404
00:24:10,645 --> 00:24:13,372
Aren't you a member
of the Mask and Foil Club?

405
00:24:13,405 --> 00:24:15,050
I'm second vice-president.

406
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:17,810
How wonderful of you!

407
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,841
Do make yourself more comfortable.

408
00:24:21,605 --> 00:24:23,877
- Won't you have a cigarette?
- Thank you.

409
00:24:30,724 --> 00:24:33,565
Mr. Whistler has indeed done me
a favor, in introducing me to you.

410
00:24:33,725 --> 00:24:36,638
Oh no, Lord Augustus.
The favor is to me.

411
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,334
- Why don't you sit here?
- That will be fine.

412
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:56,782
- Do you think it's going to rain?
- I don't think so.

413
00:24:57,165 --> 00:24:59,118
Look, there's Darlington, all ready.

414
00:24:59,151 --> 00:25:01,398
Thank you, Lancelot.
Excuse me a moment.

415
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:06,325
- Good afternoon, Arthur.
- Hello. I hope you're in good form.

416
00:25:06,485 --> 00:25:09,505
- Well, I hope I won't disappoint you.
- Excuse me, Margaret.

417
00:25:10,605 --> 00:25:12,523
I want to apologize, Lady Windermere.

418
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:14,069
Now, what have you done?

419
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,804
I told you the other evening that even
you could never look more beautiful.

420
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:19,400
Now that I see you today,
I find I was wrong.

421
00:25:19,404 --> 00:25:21,125
I wonder why a man
thinks he's pleasing a woman

422
00:25:21,285 --> 00:25:22,965
when he says things to her
he doesn't mean.

423
00:25:23,124 --> 00:25:24,903
- But I do mean them.
- I hope not.

424
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:26,886
I like you very much, you know that.

425
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:29,872
But I shouldn't like you if I thought
you were what most other men are.

426
00:25:29,906 --> 00:25:33,390
You're better than most. Sometimes
I think you pretend to be worse.

427
00:25:33,807 --> 00:25:36,217
If you pretend to be good,
the world takes you seriously.

428
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:37,654
If you pretend to be bad, it doesn't.

429
00:25:37,687 --> 00:25:39,444
Don't you want the world
to take you seriously?

430
00:25:39,645 --> 00:25:42,324
No, but I want YOU to take me seriously,
Lady Windermere.

431
00:25:42,637 --> 00:25:43,684
Why me?

432
00:25:43,845 --> 00:25:47,365
Because we might be great friends.
And you may need a friend someday.

433
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:52,107
I think we are good friends, and will be
so long as you don't spoil our friendship.

434
00:25:52,365 --> 00:25:55,255
What's the matter with Darlington?
Has he given up already?

435
00:25:57,365 --> 00:25:59,565
Lady Windermere,
it would have been much kinder to me

436
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,045
if you'd come heavily veiled
and swathed in thick shawls.

437
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:05,005
I shall have the most terrible time
keeping my eyes on my opponent.

438
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:07,844
It is useless to protest, all men
are bound to pay you compliments.

439
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:10,085
Compliments are the only things
I can afford to pay.

440
00:26:10,245 --> 00:26:12,805
Do you remember there's a match
you're supposed to take part in?

441
00:26:12,965 --> 00:26:15,045
Do you think the rain will hold off?
It looks very threatening.

442
00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:17,268
I don't think it will rain.
What do you think, Robert?

443
00:26:20,125 --> 00:26:22,485
- Your guest, Arthur?
- Mrs. Erlynne?

444
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:24,844
Augustus is a fool.

445
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:32,210
You must pay me a great deal
of attention this afternoon, I shall need it.

446
00:26:32,243 --> 00:26:33,385
Tell me who people are.

447
00:26:34,405 --> 00:26:36,719
Well, there is my sister,
the Duchess of Berwick.

448
00:26:37,711 --> 00:26:41,162
Who on earth is that with my brother?
Do you know her, Mr. Hopper?

449
00:26:41,195 --> 00:26:43,525
What an interesting face!
You must introduce me to her.

450
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:45,271
And next to her,
Lady Agatha, my niece.

451
00:26:46,445 --> 00:26:48,216
And there is Lady Windermere.

452
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,092
Her name is Mrs. Erlynne.

453
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,819
She lives at the same hotel
as I, the Albemarle.

454
00:26:53,853 --> 00:26:57,376
- Is there a Mr. Erlynne?
- I don't think anybody knows.

455
00:26:58,724 --> 00:27:01,324
She looks like an edition deluxe
of a wicked French novel

456
00:27:01,525 --> 00:27:03,528
meant especially for the English market.

457
00:27:04,685 --> 00:27:06,013
They say she has quite a past.

458
00:27:06,735 --> 00:27:08,810
She looks as if she had
at least a dozen.

459
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,344
Well, Arthur, are we going to start?

460
00:27:11,378 --> 00:27:13,233
Perhaps we had better postpone
the match.

461
00:27:13,597 --> 00:27:16,887
Due to the inclemency of the weather
or the arrival of Mrs. Erlynne?

462
00:27:17,685 --> 00:27:18,916
All right, let's start.

463
00:27:29,405 --> 00:27:30,312
Are you ready?

464
00:27:35,525 --> 00:27:36,834
<i>En garde!</i>

465
00:27:40,564 --> 00:27:41,574
Play.

466
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,532
- Agatha?
- Yes, Mama?

467
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:48,926
We are going inside.
I won't risk ruining my new hat

468
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,785
to see whether Graham touches
Darlington first, or Darlington Graham.

469
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:53,938
Come along with us, Margaret,
or you'll be drenched.

470
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:55,765
I can't leave.
The match isn't over yet.

471
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,741
My dear, they can't possibly
go on in this weather.

472
00:27:57,774 --> 00:27:59,730
Look, Arthur is calling the match now.

473
00:28:04,572 --> 00:28:05,530
All right, it's finished.

474
00:28:05,605 --> 00:28:07,285
My dear lady, do hurry for the carriage

475
00:28:07,444 --> 00:28:10,032
or your lovely hat will get soaked
and it will quite break my heart.

476
00:28:10,245 --> 00:28:13,295
Maybe I can heal your heart.
I'll allow you to buy me a new hat.

477
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:17,241
TouchÃ©, Lord Windermere.
The heavens are with you this time.

478
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:18,384
Come, Augustus.

479
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:29,846
Wait for me.

480
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:36,378
- Kindly leave that sign where it is.
- I beg your pardon, sir?

481
00:28:36,565 --> 00:28:39,080
- This house has been let, I'm the agent.
- It has not been let.

482
00:28:39,124 --> 00:28:41,499
But Lord Windermere will sign the lease
this afternoon.

483
00:28:41,645 --> 00:28:43,408
Oh, he will?
Extremely interesting.

484
00:28:46,565 --> 00:28:47,546
You there!

485
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:51,879
Augustus?
Have you completely lost your mind?

486
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:54,768
- What are you doing?
- Well, as you see, dear boy,

487
00:28:55,325 --> 00:28:58,016
there's no end to what I'd do
for an attractive woman.

488
00:28:58,324 --> 00:28:59,779
And she's damned attractive.

489
00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:02,325
But I don't understand all this.

490
00:29:02,965 --> 00:29:05,678
She must be rich.
She's taken this house.

491
00:29:06,765 --> 00:29:09,224
Who is she? Where does she come from?

492
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,019
Why hasn't she got any relatives?

493
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:14,327
Damn nuisance, relatives I know, but
they make one respectable.

494
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:16,839
Why are the women so down on her?

495
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,716
You should hear what my sister says.

496
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,694
Don't tell me the Duchess of Berwick
has met her.

497
00:29:20,728 --> 00:29:23,525
Not yet, but she's heard things
about her, didn't leave a rag on her.

498
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:25,645
It doesn't matter,
she's got an really fine figure.

499
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,883
Mrs. Erlynne, I mean, not my sister.

500
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:29,685
Oh, I don't know what to do.

501
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:32,074
Sometimes one would think
I was married to Mrs. Erlynne.

502
00:29:32,108 --> 00:29:33,941
She treats me with such indifference

503
00:29:34,045 --> 00:29:36,724
and when I complain about it, she's
so clever, she can explain everything.

504
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:38,325
Do you mind if I have a word with her?

505
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,485
She can't get into society,
can she Arthur?

506
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:41,845
Where is she?

507
00:29:42,005 --> 00:29:44,093
Upstairs, deciding on the mood
for her bedroom.

508
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:45,891
Would you introduce her to your wife?

509
00:29:46,704 --> 00:29:47,874
Would you do that, old boy?

510
00:29:53,485 --> 00:29:57,217
Mrs. Erlynne, will you please tell me
what this is all about?

511
00:29:57,365 --> 00:30:00,726
Brocade is always handsome,
but it rather ages one.

512
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,123
I wonder about tartan,
billows of tartan.

513
00:30:03,156 --> 00:30:05,776
I do love tartan.
So fresh and spring-like!

514
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,112
Help me decide, Windermere.
What do you think?

515
00:30:08,145 --> 00:30:10,677
This lease was sent to my solicitor
for my signature and my check.

516
00:30:10,711 --> 00:30:12,244
I'm supposed to take
this house for a year.

517
00:30:12,404 --> 00:30:14,444
With an option for another.
Clever of me to think of that!

518
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:17,325
- For 350 pounds.
- Guineas, my dear man.

519
00:30:17,765 --> 00:30:21,017
And I had to be most pathetic
to the agent to get if for so little.

520
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:23,561
It's a charming house, isn't it?

521
00:30:23,595 --> 00:30:27,718
What has made you think that
I am going to provide you with a house?

522
00:30:27,752 --> 00:30:28,693
Good reasons.

523
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,405
I could tell them to you,
but mystery fascinates you, doesn't it?

524
00:30:31,604 --> 00:30:33,965
I have no intention of presenting you
with this house.

525
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:35,724
Perhaps you haven't at the moment.

526
00:30:35,805 --> 00:30:38,805
But in a little while you'll be absolutely
astonished at the change in you.

527
00:30:38,965 --> 00:30:41,405
Your self-confidence
is entirely misplaced.

528
00:30:41,484 --> 00:30:45,324
Oh no, it isn't. You will want to give me
this house for two reasons.

529
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:48,645
It will make ideal campaign headquarters
for my siege of Lord Augustus.

530
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,924
Am I supposed to encourage
Lord Augustus to marry you?

531
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,844
Oh dear me, no. I'll do that.

532
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:55,405
It will require
only the most primitive technique.

533
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,245
All sunshine one day,
complete indifference the next.

534
00:30:58,405 --> 00:31:02,445
And there you are, or rather, there I'll be.
Lady Augustus Lorton.

535
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:05,412
I dare say you'll make him
an admirable wife.

536
00:31:05,892 --> 00:31:08,950
He will think so,
and so probably shall I.

537
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:13,974
But I require your financial assistance
before we're officially engaged.

538
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:15,786
He will propose eventually,

539
00:31:15,805 --> 00:31:19,845
but it would hasten things considerably
if I had the added attraction of a dowry.

540
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,805
He can so easily think
that I inherited it from a third cousin

541
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:26,182
or a second husband,
or some distant relative of that kind.

542
00:31:26,216 --> 00:31:30,005
Nothing ostentatious,
say... 2,500 pounds or so.

543
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:34,445
Mrs. Erlynne, you are the most
outrageously brazen woman I ever met.

544
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:38,506
Thank you, I always enjoy being
described with a superlative degree.

545
00:31:38,925 --> 00:31:42,085
Do you really mean that I am
to give you a house and a small fortune

546
00:31:42,244 --> 00:31:44,005
because I called on you once?

547
00:31:44,164 --> 00:31:46,405
You are fascinated by me, admit it.

548
00:31:46,565 --> 00:31:49,692
It rained the other day,
Lord Windermere... for you.

549
00:31:50,884 --> 00:31:53,852
But now the sun is shining... for me.

550
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:59,005
Will you kindly tell me why you feel
you can practice this extortion?

551
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:02,245
- I'm going to tell you.
- Mrs. Erlynne? My dear lady.

552
00:32:02,445 --> 00:32:04,995
I quite forgot Augustus. It's so easy to.

553
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,626
I'll send him away at once.

554
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:10,199
- Come back later and I'll tell you then.
- I must insist that you tell me now.

555
00:32:10,232 --> 00:32:12,100
- Come back at five o'clock.
- I shall be busy at five.

556
00:32:12,245 --> 00:32:15,215
Not that busy.
I'll see you at five o'clock.

557
00:32:15,525 --> 00:32:17,777
I'm coming, my dear Augustus.

558
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:22,445
Poor Arthur, he was furious with me,
with himself, with everything

559
00:32:22,605 --> 00:32:25,245
because he knew
he would come back at five o'clock.

560
00:32:25,405 --> 00:32:27,125
- And did he?
- Promptly.

561
00:32:27,285 --> 00:32:29,325
You know how curious men are.

562
00:32:29,485 --> 00:32:32,245
- I'm sure you satisfied his curiosity.
- Certainly.

563
00:32:32,405 --> 00:32:35,444
- May I ask how?
- In the simplest possible way.

564
00:32:35,645 --> 00:32:39,005
By telling him the truth.
There is nothing like a lifetime of lying

565
00:32:39,164 --> 00:32:42,365
to make one realize
how effective the truth can be.

566
00:32:42,525 --> 00:32:44,405
You understand that, don't you,
Lord Darlington?

567
00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:47,565
- My life was not devoted to lying.
- It didn't have to be.

568
00:32:47,725 --> 00:32:51,005
You let the lies come to you,
and then used them most adroitly

569
00:32:51,205 --> 00:32:53,844
in your attempt to break up
the Windermere marriage.

570
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:56,325
Yes, but I honestly loved Margaret

571
00:32:56,485 --> 00:33:00,245
and I had no hope until I heard
those stories about you and Arthur.

572
00:33:00,405 --> 00:33:04,365
His visits to you, and his paying
for your house in Curzon Street.

573
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:08,165
That gossip was a godsend to me.
It was my chance.

574
00:33:08,325 --> 00:33:10,915
- And you took it.
- And I took it.

575
00:33:11,205 --> 00:33:14,645
I knew she was going shopping that day
so I waited for her

576
00:33:14,805 --> 00:33:17,605
and followed her
to the Burlington Arcade.

577
00:33:18,405 --> 00:33:20,724
<i>It was too great a temptation.</i>

578
00:33:20,885 --> 00:33:24,844
<i>And you know that a man can resist
everything except temptation.'</i>

579
00:33:47,645 --> 00:33:49,244
If I had known you were coming
this way today

580
00:33:49,405 --> 00:33:52,127
I would have covered the street
with flowers for you to walk upon.

581
00:33:52,161 --> 00:33:53,325
Good morning, Lord Darlington.

582
00:33:53,485 --> 00:33:56,750
I've been so busy, I almost forgot
to get slippers to dance in.

583
00:33:56,783 --> 00:33:58,039
You're always the sweet exception.

584
00:33:58,072 --> 00:34:00,885
Other women think first of their costumes,
then of the occasion for them.

585
00:34:01,044 --> 00:34:03,273
You know a great deal about women.
It's rather too bad

586
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,808
you've made it your only study.

587
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,437
I admit it was a waste of time.

588
00:34:06,534 --> 00:34:08,380
I found that out
when I began to study you.

589
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:10,901
I'm not sure I like
being observed so closely.

590
00:34:10,935 --> 00:34:14,325
What will you forbid me next?
To look at flowers, to see the sun?

591
00:34:14,484 --> 00:34:16,538
What a fascinating puritan you are.

592
00:34:16,571 --> 00:34:20,464
The adjective was quite unnecessary.
Perhaps I am rather a puritan.

593
00:34:20,524 --> 00:34:23,312
After my mother died,
my father's sister took charge of me.

594
00:34:23,346 --> 00:34:25,405
She taught me to remember
what the world is forgetting,

595
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:28,285
the difference between right and wrong.

596
00:34:28,319 --> 00:34:30,924
- She allowed no compromise?
- Nor do I.

597
00:34:31,246 --> 00:34:32,925
I wonder if you wouldn't
consider a compromise

598
00:34:33,085 --> 00:34:35,500
in a case such as I happened
to hear of recently.

599
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,077
The case of a young married couple.

600
00:34:37,285 --> 00:34:40,833
The husband has become involved with
a woman of rather doubtful character.

601
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:44,298
So doubtful in fact that there is
no doubt whatsoever about it.

602
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,942
He calls on her constantly
and he's said to be paying her bills.

603
00:34:47,976 --> 00:34:49,327
Don't you think that in this instance

604
00:34:49,397 --> 00:34:52,168
the wife has a right
to seek consolation elsewhere?

605
00:34:52,202 --> 00:34:54,765
You mean because the husband is vile
the wife should be vile too?

606
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:58,605
- Vile is a terrible word.
- But it's a terrible thing, Lord Darlington.

607
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:00,405
Look, Agatha.
There's Lady Windermere.

608
00:35:00,564 --> 00:35:04,396
My dearest Margaret,
how pleased I am to see you!

609
00:35:05,844 --> 00:35:08,420
Agatha, tell Lady Windermere
how delighted you are to see her.

610
00:35:08,645 --> 00:35:09,725
Yes, Mama.

611
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,795
How do you do, Lord Darlington?
Do have the good sense to leave us.

612
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:15,789
There are two things a man
should never find out about a woman.

613
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:18,613
What she really thinks of him
and the size of her shoes.

614
00:35:18,647 --> 00:35:21,165
I suppose we shall see you
at Lady Windermere's ball.

615
00:35:21,325 --> 00:35:24,199
It's not a ball, it's only a dance.
It's small and early.

616
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:26,045
Very small, very early and very select.

617
00:35:26,205 --> 00:35:30,136
We know that. I don't know
what the rest of society is coming to.

618
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,028
One meets the most dreadful
people everywhere.

619
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:33,717
They certainly come to my parties.

620
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:35,831
Yours is one of the few houses
left in London where

621
00:35:35,845 --> 00:35:37,845
I can take Agatha
and feel perfectly secure.

622
00:35:38,004 --> 00:35:42,051
By the way, Margaret, have you sent
an invitation to Mr. James Hopper?

623
00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:43,296
I don't know Mr. Hopper.

624
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,365
He's that Australian
everyone is taking so much notice of.

625
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:48,365
His father made a fortune by selling
some sort of food in circular tins.

626
00:35:48,525 --> 00:35:50,246
Most palatable, I believe.

627
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:52,743
I fancy it's the thing
the servants always refuse to eat.

628
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:56,309
- Mr. Hopper is quite taken with Agatha.
- Of course, I'll send him an invitation.

629
00:35:56,342 --> 00:35:59,553
I'm so much interested in Australia.
Agatha has found it on the map.

630
00:35:59,645 --> 00:36:03,043
It must be so pretty with
all the little kangaroos flying about.

631
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,605
Australia is a very young country,
isn't it?

632
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:06,805
Wasn't it made at the same time
as the others, Duchess?

633
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,554
How clever you are, Margaret.
No, no Darlington.

634
00:36:09,805 --> 00:36:13,307
You mustn't dream of talking to Agatha.
You're far too wicked a man.

635
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,445
Come now.
As a wicked man I'm a complete failure.

636
00:36:15,604 --> 00:36:18,639
Everyone says I've never done
anything really wrong in my life.

637
00:36:18,672 --> 00:36:20,678
Of course they only say it
behind my back.

638
00:36:20,966 --> 00:36:22,178
Goodbye, ladies.

639
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:27,851
What does he mean by that?
I suppose we shall never find out.

640
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:30,345
- Come on, Agatha.
- Yes, Mama.

641
00:36:30,762 --> 00:36:33,220
<i>- Goodbye, Monsieur Philippe.
- Au revoir. A dans 15 jours.</i>

642
00:36:42,445 --> 00:36:45,525
Margaret, you tell him dear.
He never understands my French.

643
00:36:45,558 --> 00:36:48,384
He must come from some little village
where they speak a sort of patois.

644
00:36:48,418 --> 00:36:49,675
The shoes need stretching.

645
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:51,837
My little toe hurts me
whatever I do with it.

646
00:37:03,645 --> 00:37:06,484
- He'll bring another pair.
- Yes dear, I understood that.

647
00:37:12,205 --> 00:37:13,965
- Agatha, darling?
- Yes, Mama?

648
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:16,325
See those shiny buckles over there,
aren't they charming?

649
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:17,405
Yes, Mama.

650
00:37:17,565 --> 00:37:20,565
- Go over and look at them more closely.
- Yes, Mama.

651
00:37:20,765 --> 00:37:24,730
Dear girl, she's so fond of shiny things.
Such a pure taste.

652
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:28,913
I do so admire you, dear Margaret.
You're being so brave about this.

653
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:31,259
- Brave about what, Duchess?
- And wise.

654
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:34,301
But the best thing you can do is
to take him to Vichy for the waters.

655
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:36,501
- Take whom?
- Why, Arthur of course!

656
00:37:36,685 --> 00:37:38,928
Then you can keep him
under your eye all day long.

657
00:37:38,961 --> 00:37:42,601
I assure you, my dear, that on several
occasions I had to pretend to be very ill

658
00:37:42,634 --> 00:37:45,041
and I was obliged to drink
the most unpleasant mineral waters

659
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,953
just to get my husband out of town.

660
00:37:47,245 --> 00:37:49,245
He was so strongly susceptible.

661
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:52,761
But he'd never give away
any large sums of money to anybody.

662
00:37:52,795 --> 00:37:54,325
He was too high principled for that.

663
00:37:54,484 --> 00:37:57,042
My dear Duchess, won't you tell
what you are talking about?

664
00:37:59,525 --> 00:38:03,045
My husband and I, believe or not,
married for love, just like you and Arthur.

665
00:38:03,205 --> 00:38:04,725
We all begin like that.

666
00:38:04,885 --> 00:38:08,218
And before the year was out, he was
running after all kinds of petticoats.

667
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:10,091
Every color, shape and material.

668
00:38:10,395 --> 00:38:12,241
Please, Duchess,
what is all this about?

669
00:38:12,445 --> 00:38:15,565
Wicked women get our husbands away
from us, but they always come back.

670
00:38:15,725 --> 00:38:19,205
Damaged, of course, but they
come back. What pretty slippers!

671
00:38:19,405 --> 00:38:22,085
Do you mean wicked women in general
or some particular wicked woman?

672
00:38:22,285 --> 00:38:24,583
- I mean Mrs. Erlynne, naturally.
- Mrs. Erlynne?

673
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,147
I've never heard of her.
What is she to do with Arthur?

674
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:30,685
Everyone looked on Windermere
as such a model husband.

675
00:38:30,844 --> 00:38:34,755
Please, Duchess. Is it necessary
to discuss this in front of...

676
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:38,497
- He can't understand a word I say.
- I can't either.

677
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,890
That woman has actually
taken a house in Curzon Street

678
00:38:40,924 --> 00:38:43,765
and they say that Arthur goes there
four or five times a week.

679
00:38:43,925 --> 00:38:46,085
She must have got
a great deal of money out of somebody.

680
00:38:46,245 --> 00:38:49,845
It seems she arrived in London a few
weeks ago without anything to speak of.

681
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:54,485
Now she has a charming house, drives
a pony in the park every afternoon

682
00:38:54,645 --> 00:38:57,765
and all this since she's known
poor dear Windermere.

683
00:38:57,925 --> 00:39:00,165
But her house and her horses
can't be due to Arthur.

684
00:39:00,365 --> 00:39:02,923
Margaret, tell him I'll take these shoes
and I'll take them with me.

685
00:39:06,485 --> 00:39:08,685
Somebody is giving her money
and it isn't Augustus.

686
00:39:08,844 --> 00:39:12,131
He's head over heels about her,
exactly what one would expect of him.

687
00:39:12,245 --> 00:39:13,644
But he's given her nothing.

688
00:39:13,805 --> 00:39:16,365
I know because I examine
his check book every night.

689
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:18,885
You look in your brother's check book
without his knowledge?

690
00:39:19,045 --> 00:39:21,125
- Of course I do. Agatha?
- Yes, Mama?

691
00:39:21,285 --> 00:39:23,005
- Well, get the shoes dear.
- Yes, Mama.

692
00:39:23,165 --> 00:39:27,103
- You're not going to cry, are you?
- You needn't be afraid, Duchess.

693
00:39:27,136 --> 00:39:29,725
I don't believe a word of this gossip
and besides, I never cry.

694
00:39:29,885 --> 00:39:31,285
Quite right, my dear.

695
00:39:31,561 --> 00:39:35,104
Crying is the refuge of plain women.
But it's the ruin of pretty ones.

696
00:39:44,845 --> 00:39:47,562
- It was a pleasant evening, wasn't it?
- I loved it.

697
00:39:47,805 --> 00:39:51,600
We should go to the theatre more often.
Society is at its best there.

698
00:39:52,044 --> 00:39:54,485
All the chattering comes
from the other side of the footlights.

699
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:56,507
So different from the opera,
isn't it?

700
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,605
Did you hear what somebody said
about the opera?

701
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:02,878
They enjoy it because the singing
never interferes with their conversation.

702
00:40:04,244 --> 00:40:06,285
- Who did you hear say that?
- I don't know.

703
00:40:06,444 --> 00:40:08,325
Somebody told me
somebody had said it.

704
00:40:08,443 --> 00:40:10,707
So late in the season,
people repeat almost anything.

705
00:40:11,924 --> 00:40:14,045
I'll recommend you as a hairdresser
to all my friends.

706
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:16,917
I should be glad to serve them,
but my heart wouldn't be in my work.

707
00:40:16,951 --> 00:40:18,327
If it should be, I'd kill them.

708
00:40:18,725 --> 00:40:20,824
Are the plans for your birthday party
all in order?

709
00:40:21,005 --> 00:40:24,528
I really think I've attended
to every single thing about the dance.

710
00:40:24,562 --> 00:40:26,925
No, I haven't. I didn't send a card
to Mr. Hopper.

711
00:40:27,085 --> 00:40:28,376
I must do it at once.

712
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:30,340
- You must do no such thing.
- I promised the Duchess.

713
00:40:30,373 --> 00:40:32,095
You can keep your promise
in the morning.

714
00:40:33,205 --> 00:40:34,605
You didn't tell me
you saw the Duchess.

715
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:38,692
- I met her at Philippe's.
- How many reputations did she destroy?

716
00:40:38,726 --> 00:40:41,325
Oh, she was rather interesting today.
She talked about you.

717
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:42,924
What did she say about me?

718
00:40:43,085 --> 00:40:45,885
Except, of course, the highest praise
for my character and for my tailor.

719
00:40:46,045 --> 00:40:49,244
I didn't pay much attention to most of it.
In fact, to any of it.

720
00:40:49,582 --> 00:40:50,884
She did say you were extravagant.

721
00:40:51,045 --> 00:40:54,044
It seems you've been buying houses
and horses and all sorts of things

722
00:40:54,205 --> 00:40:56,205
for some mysterious lady
that recently came to London.

723
00:40:56,364 --> 00:40:59,205
Mrs. Erly, or Eryl,
I really don't remember.

724
00:40:59,735 --> 00:41:01,965
Well, I'm glad
you don't pay much attention to her.

725
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:04,365
Why should I?
You remember what she told us

726
00:41:04,525 --> 00:41:07,778
about Lady Jansen and her husband
and that incident in the South of France.

727
00:41:08,765 --> 00:41:10,684
Come, let's have no more horrible stories.

728
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:12,782
Did you see anyone pleasant today?

729
00:41:14,112 --> 00:41:18,385
- Yes. I met Lord Darlington.
- Oh, Robert?

730
00:41:18,565 --> 00:41:21,304
I saw him too,
or rather I caught a glimpse of him.

731
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:24,925
- He went past me in Curzon Street.
- Curzon Street?

732
00:41:25,085 --> 00:41:27,644
What were you doing
in Curzon Street, Arthur?

733
00:41:27,845 --> 00:41:30,365
I was endeavoring to get
from one end of it to the other.

734
00:41:30,524 --> 00:41:32,765
Why do you ask
such nonsensical questions?

735
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:36,125
I don't know. I suppose I must have
nonsense in my head.

736
00:41:37,205 --> 00:41:40,845
You're tired, darling, that's what it is.
You need a rest, I think we both do.

737
00:41:41,005 --> 00:41:43,761
- Why don't we go abroad after the ball?
- That's curious.

738
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:45,685
- What is?
- You're suggesting that we go abroad.

739
00:41:45,845 --> 00:41:48,915
The Duchess suggested it too,
she thought it would be a very good thing.

740
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:52,101
Then for once the Duchess and I agree.
Even she can't be wrong always.

741
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:57,211
No, I suppose she can't always.

742
00:41:57,404 --> 00:42:00,386
- Is something wrong, darling?
- No, I was just thinking.

743
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,023
- What about?
- Lady Jansen.

744
00:42:02,325 --> 00:42:05,399
She and Lord Jansen no longer live
under the same roof. She left him.

745
00:42:05,433 --> 00:42:07,605
I said that the Duchess
had to be right sometimes.

746
00:42:07,805 --> 00:42:09,165
It has to do with the law of averages.

747
00:42:09,337 --> 00:42:12,248
- Arthur, what's the matter with you?
- What's supposed to be the matter?

748
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:14,817
- You just shouted.
- I didn't do anything of the kind!

749
00:42:18,005 --> 00:42:20,398
And if I did, you show me the man

750
00:42:20,432 --> 00:42:22,992
who can discuss the Duchess of Berwick
without losing his patience.

751
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,025
And you show me the woman.

752
00:43:04,764 --> 00:43:07,469
Margaret, what on earth are you doing?

753
00:43:08,565 --> 00:43:10,085
Of course.

754
00:43:10,285 --> 00:43:12,564
You couldn't wait to see what
your birthday present was.

755
00:43:12,725 --> 00:43:14,925
You know what happens to little girls
who can't wait

756
00:43:15,085 --> 00:43:16,964
and steal a look at their gifts, don't you?

757
00:43:18,005 --> 00:43:20,599
Don't look so frightened.
I'd love to give it to you now.

758
00:43:20,633 --> 00:43:22,456
You needn't wait a moment longer.

759
00:43:22,525 --> 00:43:24,313
Happy birthday, Lady Windermere.

760
00:43:26,674 --> 00:43:29,378
Oh, it's lovely, it's enchanting.

761
00:43:29,405 --> 00:43:31,831
You're an angel, Arthur,
you're my good angel.

762
00:43:31,864 --> 00:43:35,175
You've kept me from doing something
I should've been very much ashamed of.

763
00:43:35,645 --> 00:43:39,159
- What could you do to be ashamed of?
- I couldn't sleep.

764
00:43:39,192 --> 00:43:43,401
My mind kept going round and round
about the Duchess and Lady Jansen

765
00:43:43,435 --> 00:43:45,770
and houses and horses
and mysterious women

766
00:43:45,804 --> 00:43:47,945
and about how the Duchess
was right sometimes and...

767
00:43:48,565 --> 00:43:51,099
Then when you said
you'd been in Curzon Street I...

768
00:43:51,124 --> 00:43:54,210
I kept thinking.
Suddenly I just had to know.

769
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,845
It wasn't about the birthday present.

770
00:43:56,879 --> 00:43:59,306
- It was because I was going to.
- Going to what?

771
00:43:59,685 --> 00:44:02,154
Because I was going to look
at your check book.

772
00:44:02,925 --> 00:44:04,546
Margaret, that isn't like you!

773
00:44:05,202 --> 00:44:06,228
I know.

774
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:11,522
Wasn't I an idiot? All this fuss and worry
when all I needed to do is to ask you.

775
00:44:11,556 --> 00:44:13,085
Darling, you're so tired,
you must go to sleep...

776
00:44:13,245 --> 00:44:14,725
You would have told me, wouldn't you?

777
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:17,259
- It's nearly morning, come to bed.
- Wouldn't you?

778
00:44:17,845 --> 00:44:21,644
- Please Margaret, it's so late.
- Arthur, tell me now that it isn't true.

779
00:44:21,678 --> 00:44:23,011
Will you stop this foolishness?

780
00:44:23,549 --> 00:44:25,920
Have you been paying money
to this woman?

781
00:44:31,724 --> 00:44:34,948
- Then I must find out for myself!
- You don't understand.

782
00:44:35,165 --> 00:44:39,102
Things are not always what they appear.
- Mrs. Erlynne, 600 pounds.

783
00:44:39,136 --> 00:44:40,845
It's insane to misconstrue circumstances.

784
00:44:41,005 --> 00:44:44,324
- Mrs. Erlynne, 400 pounds.
- Things seem to be what they're not.

785
00:44:44,484 --> 00:44:47,642
Mrs. E, 700 pounds. Mrs. E...
Oh, it's all true!

786
00:44:47,675 --> 00:44:51,058
- I only ask you to trust me.
- Trust you, after what I've just seen?

787
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:53,827
After the money
you've given and given to this trollop.

788
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,936
- You mustn't say such things about her.
- Why mustn't I?

789
00:44:55,965 --> 00:44:57,258
Because they're wrong.

790
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:01,958
As long as I've known Mrs. Erlynne,
her conduct has been beyond criticism.

791
00:45:01,992 --> 00:45:05,810
- Perhaps it's true that many years ago...
- Please, spare me the story of her life.

792
00:45:06,045 --> 00:45:08,652
Listen to me.
Mrs. Erlynne lost everything,

793
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,060
threw it away if you like.

794
00:45:10,404 --> 00:45:13,323
All she wants is a chance to get
her life back again, to have a new start.

795
00:45:13,365 --> 00:45:15,151
That's all she wants from me
or from anyone else.

796
00:45:15,357 --> 00:45:18,926
- I've tried to help this woman.
- So I can see from your check book.

797
00:45:18,959 --> 00:45:21,360
Margaret, believe me.
I've done nothing to hurt our love.

798
00:45:21,393 --> 00:45:24,124
You have. You thought
because I had no father or mother

799
00:45:24,157 --> 00:45:27,614
that you could humiliate me and
degrade me and I'd do nothing about it?

800
00:45:27,648 --> 00:45:30,082
It drives me mad when I think of you
and that woman

801
00:45:30,116 --> 00:45:32,563
congratulating each other
on my ignorance.

802
00:45:32,565 --> 00:45:35,607
Laughing and smirking together
while I trust in you.

803
00:45:35,641 --> 00:45:38,713
I wish to Heaven, I could find
a way to hurt you

804
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:40,641
and her as you two have hurt me.

805
00:45:40,885 --> 00:45:44,051
And I will find it, I will!
You'll see that I will.

806
00:46:33,766 --> 00:46:34,765
- Good afternoon, Bessie.
- Good afternoon, madam.

807
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,785
- Has anyone called?
- Lord Windermere has been waiting.

808
00:46:38,444 --> 00:46:41,125
If I'd known you were coming
I never would have coaxed Augustus

809
00:46:41,324 --> 00:46:43,124
into playing that second set.

810
00:46:43,325 --> 00:46:45,365
The house is beginning
to look like a house, isn't it?

811
00:46:45,525 --> 00:46:49,125
I've been involved with masses
of upholsterers and drapers.

812
00:46:49,284 --> 00:46:51,845
I had to plead, virtually on my knees,
with the carpet dealers

813
00:46:52,044 --> 00:46:53,925
or there would have been
no new carpets for months.

814
00:46:54,632 --> 00:46:55,805
I'm sorry, Mrs. Erlynne,

815
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:58,773
but there will no further need for carpets
or anything else for this house.

816
00:47:00,732 --> 00:47:02,488
- And why not?
- Because you're leaving it.

817
00:47:02,522 --> 00:47:04,162
You're leaving London, leaving England.

818
00:47:04,285 --> 00:47:07,215
- Margaret knows everything?
- Not everything, but enough.

819
00:47:07,285 --> 00:47:09,328
- Who told her?
- Some 'friend'.

820
00:47:09,845 --> 00:47:12,604
I'm sorry I didn't tell her
the truth myself from the first.

821
00:47:12,765 --> 00:47:16,781
Curious. I regret my bad actions
and you regret your good ones.

822
00:47:16,815 --> 00:47:19,725
All London is gossiping about this house
and the money I gave you.

823
00:47:19,884 --> 00:47:23,632
- You take these things too seriously.
- Mrs. Erlynne, I wanted to help you.

824
00:47:23,666 --> 00:47:27,395
I didn't realize how things would seem
and what people would say.

825
00:47:27,405 --> 00:47:28,552
You must leave London.

826
00:47:29,294 --> 00:47:30,873
You're breaking your word, Arthur.

827
00:47:31,165 --> 00:47:34,874
You promised me the chance
of a new life, a secure and decent life.

828
00:47:34,908 --> 00:47:37,505
- I know I did.
- Well, you haven't given me that chance.

829
00:47:37,538 --> 00:47:40,925
I've not yet assured my position so that
Lord Augustus will ask me to marry him.

830
00:47:41,085 --> 00:47:44,284
- I can't help it, you must go.
- Please don't give me orders, Arthur.

831
00:47:44,405 --> 00:47:46,567
I shall stay in London
as long as I choose.

832
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:49,825
- Yes, Bessie?
- I beg your pardon, madam.

833
00:47:49,858 --> 00:47:52,038
This has just been delivered
by special messenger.

834
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:55,801
You don't want to cause Margaret
any more pain, do you?

835
00:47:55,925 --> 00:47:58,011
I've never seen her
as she was last night.

836
00:47:58,045 --> 00:48:01,158
Today, she locked herself in her room,
there's no telling what she might do.

837
00:48:01,191 --> 00:48:04,285
I can't lose her.
If I do, I lose life itself.

838
00:48:04,444 --> 00:48:07,568
- And what about my life?
- Must you always think of yourself?

839
00:48:08,205 --> 00:48:12,168
Don't you realize that if you stay here
Margaret will find out who you are?

840
00:48:12,207 --> 00:48:14,365
If she does find out,
will the world come to an end?

841
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:18,365
- It would for her.
- You'll not hound me out of London.

842
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:20,622
I've made mistakes, yes,
and I've paid for them.

843
00:48:20,656 --> 00:48:22,485
And now you come to me
and tell me I must pay again

844
00:48:22,645 --> 00:48:25,205
and go on paying for the rest of my life?
Well, I won't do it.

845
00:48:25,685 --> 00:48:27,990
My account is settled
and I'll pay no more.

846
00:48:28,023 --> 00:48:31,112
I too have been paying
for your mistakes, Mrs. Erlynne.

847
00:48:31,146 --> 00:48:35,006
And I'm willing to pay considerably more
to end any further demands on me.

848
00:48:36,045 --> 00:48:38,926
I'm making out this check to you
for 10,000 pounds.

849
00:48:39,965 --> 00:48:42,584
It's drawn on the Paris branch
of my bank.

850
00:48:43,165 --> 00:48:46,805
Payable only in Paris
and only within the next three days.

851
00:48:46,964 --> 00:48:48,849
I won't go and that is final.

852
00:48:49,685 --> 00:48:52,130
The club train leaves at 10:45 tonight.

853
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:56,093
There is no emergency
to excuse your conduct.

854
00:48:56,605 --> 00:48:59,205
You're disposing of my life
with utter selfishness,

855
00:48:59,365 --> 00:49:02,325
and now you add vulgarity to cruelty.

856
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:05,698
You're the lowest of all thing,
you're cheap.

857
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:20,154
I'm leaving the check
on the mantelpiece, Mrs. Erlynne.

858
00:49:20,245 --> 00:49:21,346
Good afternoon.

859
00:49:41,205 --> 00:49:45,124
<i>As long as I live,
I'll never forget that moment.</i>

860
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:49,945
<i>There was a check of 10,000 pounds
from Lord Windermere to be rid of me.</i>

861
00:49:50,325 --> 00:49:54,357
<i>And there was an invitation to her
birthday ball from Lady Windermere.'</i>

862
00:49:54,845 --> 00:49:57,905
It was the most precious invitation
I ever received.

863
00:49:57,938 --> 00:50:00,654
The most precious invitation
from his wife?

864
00:50:01,525 --> 00:50:02,710
From my daughter.

865
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:05,877
Margaret, your daughter?

866
00:50:08,485 --> 00:50:10,065
I didn't know.

867
00:50:11,645 --> 00:50:14,366
- I never knew.
- Of course you didn't.

868
00:50:14,685 --> 00:50:17,508
It was my career to keep everybody
from knowing it.

869
00:50:17,565 --> 00:50:20,004
How could I have acknowledged
a grown-up daughter?

870
00:50:20,165 --> 00:50:24,233
I never admitted I was more than 29,
30 at the most.

871
00:50:24,644 --> 00:50:28,285
29 when they were pink shades
30 when they were not.

872
00:50:28,445 --> 00:50:32,517
But why did you become separated
from your husband and your child?

873
00:50:32,965 --> 00:50:36,403
Why does any woman leave
her husband and her child?

874
00:50:36,605 --> 00:50:39,941
- For another man.
- Who in turn, abandoned me.

875
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:41,707
I'm sorry.

876
00:50:42,685 --> 00:50:46,026
Arthur was the only one
who ever knew my secret.

877
00:50:46,685 --> 00:50:48,045
More than anything in the world,

878
00:50:48,393 --> 00:50:51,178
he wanted to spare Margaret
the humiliation of knowing

879
00:50:52,032 --> 00:50:53,704
her mother was a woman whose name

880
00:50:53,738 --> 00:50:56,379
was a scandal
in every country in Europe.

881
00:50:57,845 --> 00:50:59,929
He was right to shield her.

882
00:51:00,198 --> 00:51:02,993
I realize that now
more clearly than ever.

883
00:51:04,404 --> 00:51:07,418
That night
I went to her birthday ball.

884
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:09,567
I forget why.

885
00:51:10,475 --> 00:51:13,017
<i>Perhaps
I wanted to defy my son-in-law.</i>

886
00:51:14,365 --> 00:51:16,996
<i>Perhaps I longed to see my daughter.</i>

887
00:51:18,005 --> 00:51:19,795
<i>Anyway, I went to the ball.</i>

888
00:51:20,445 --> 00:51:21,616
Mrs. Erlynne.

889
00:51:25,485 --> 00:51:26,663
Yes, madam.

890
00:51:39,925 --> 00:51:41,610
- Good evening, Lord Windermere.
- My dear Countess!

891
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:42,805
- And Margaret.
- Good evening, my dear.

892
00:51:43,005 --> 00:51:44,565
- Excuse me.
- It's been so long.

893
00:51:45,445 --> 00:51:48,235
- Good evening, Arthur.
- Hello, John. Nice to see you.

894
00:51:49,645 --> 00:51:51,567
How dare you
come to this house tonight?

895
00:51:51,685 --> 00:51:54,450
It isn't especially daring
to accept an invitation.

896
00:51:54,525 --> 00:51:57,285
- How did you get that?
- A messenger, a special one.

897
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:59,101
Such a dependable service,
don't you think?

898
00:51:59,135 --> 00:52:01,535
You're not going in. I'll have
your carriage called at once.

899
00:52:01,569 --> 00:52:03,414
Manners before morals,
Lord Windermere.

900
00:52:03,965 --> 00:52:06,619
Good evening, Cecil.
Lord Darlington.

901
00:52:10,205 --> 00:52:13,336
Good evening, Lady Windermere.
I am Mrs. Erlynne.

902
00:52:13,485 --> 00:52:15,205
It was so charming of you to invite me.

903
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:19,221
You must have known how delighted
I'd be to meet on your birthday.

904
00:52:19,685 --> 00:52:20,909
Good evening, Mrs. Erlynne.

905
00:52:21,398 --> 00:52:22,782
Your house is enchanting.

906
00:52:22,845 --> 00:52:26,444
I'm sure you chose the decorations
yourself. One can tell such things.

907
00:52:26,478 --> 00:52:29,887
And your fan, what a lovely thing!
A birthday present?

908
00:52:29,965 --> 00:52:33,641
- Yes, from my husband.
- What exquisite taste your husband has.

909
00:52:33,675 --> 00:52:35,558
I congratulate you, Lord Windermere.

910
00:52:35,592 --> 00:52:38,987
And with all my heart,
I congratulate you, Lady Windermere.

911
00:52:39,405 --> 00:52:43,301
- Many, many happy returns of this day.
- Thank you.

912
00:52:43,605 --> 00:52:44,927
Excuse me.

913
00:52:45,725 --> 00:52:47,765
Lord Augustus,
you have quite neglected me.

914
00:52:47,925 --> 00:52:51,872
- I haven't seen you since this afternoon.
- I had no idea you were coming.

915
00:52:51,925 --> 00:52:53,161
Excuse me.

916
00:52:53,195 --> 00:52:55,686
- You should have told me.
- Isn't a surprise pleasanter?

917
00:53:11,725 --> 00:53:13,605
I give you my word
I have nothing to do with this.

918
00:53:13,805 --> 00:53:15,885
- I've no idea how she got the invitation.
- I sent it to her.

919
00:53:16,045 --> 00:53:19,085
May I dance with your wife,
or are all her dances reserved for you?

920
00:53:19,244 --> 00:53:21,605
I should be delighted, Lord Darlington.

921
00:53:25,964 --> 00:53:28,164
I thought I knew Arthur well
but apparently I don't.

922
00:53:28,325 --> 00:53:29,725
Very shrewd of him to invite her.

923
00:53:29,885 --> 00:53:32,404
Nothing looks so much like innocence
as an indiscretion.

924
00:53:32,565 --> 00:53:33,813
I invited Mrs. Erlynne.

925
00:53:35,339 --> 00:53:36,763
You did? Why?

926
00:53:36,765 --> 00:53:40,379
I don't know. I asked her
because I was hurt and angry.

927
00:53:40,412 --> 00:53:42,599
I wanted to show him,
I wanted to show them all.

928
00:53:42,725 --> 00:53:45,538
I was going to make an example
of how I was going to insult him.

929
00:53:45,572 --> 00:53:47,640
- But why didn't you?
- I couldn't.

930
00:53:47,805 --> 00:53:50,018
She's so different
from what I thought she'd be.

931
00:53:50,109 --> 00:53:51,978
When she stood there,
I could do nothing at all.

932
00:53:53,045 --> 00:53:55,980
It takes a thoroughly good woman
to do a thoroughly stupid thing.

933
00:53:56,045 --> 00:53:59,220
You played right into her hands,
you helped her to achieve triumph.

934
00:54:00,325 --> 00:54:03,653
Please take me out onto the balcony.
It's so bright and loud in here.

935
00:54:16,045 --> 00:54:17,669
Tell me what I am to do.

936
00:54:18,245 --> 00:54:22,064
You said one day I'd need a friend,
I didn't dream it would be so soon.

937
00:54:22,725 --> 00:54:25,056
But I need one now.
Will you be my friend?

938
00:54:25,205 --> 00:54:27,932
No Margaret, I cannot be
your friend any longer.

939
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:31,194
Between you and me,
there is no friendship possible.

940
00:54:31,445 --> 00:54:35,303
There is passion, enmity, worship, love,
but no friendship.

941
00:54:35,765 --> 00:54:37,836
- I love you.
- Please Robert, don't.

942
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:40,887
I 've loved from the first moment
I saw you.

943
00:54:41,085 --> 00:54:43,834
And now is the time to tell you
I want to take you away.

944
00:54:44,004 --> 00:54:46,280
I want you to leave this house tonight.

945
00:54:47,164 --> 00:54:50,150
I offer you my life, Margaret,
my whole life.

946
00:54:50,885 --> 00:54:53,786
Do what you want with it,
but please, please, take it.

947
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:56,537
I can't, I'm afraid. I'm a coward.

948
00:54:56,571 --> 00:54:59,478
You mustn't be. You must be brave,
this will take courage.

949
00:54:59,525 --> 00:55:00,805
I wish I could lie to you,

950
00:55:00,902 --> 00:55:03,323
I wish I could tell you
the world doesn't matter, but it does.

951
00:55:04,205 --> 00:55:06,885
The world and what it will say
matter far too much.

952
00:55:07,085 --> 00:55:09,763
There'll be a time of pain,
disgrace even,

953
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,636
but remember I'll be there beside you.

954
00:55:12,325 --> 00:55:15,790
When it's all over, when you no longer
have his name but mine

955
00:55:15,925 --> 00:55:19,546
the world that is so quick to turn,
will turn back again to respect you.

956
00:55:20,045 --> 00:55:23,285
You said you make no compromises,
make none now, be yourself.

957
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,669
Not now, I can't answer you now.

958
00:55:26,005 --> 00:55:27,984
I offer you my love and my life.

959
00:55:28,405 --> 00:55:30,442
I offer you more than that,
I offer you your pride,

960
00:55:31,062 --> 00:55:33,039
your self-respect, your honor.

961
00:55:33,685 --> 00:55:35,918
Leave this house with your head high.

962
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:39,562
Leave all that is ugly and tarnished
and corrupt forever.

963
00:55:39,595 --> 00:55:41,263
But suppose... suppose Arthur...

964
00:55:45,044 --> 00:55:48,561
Yes?
Suppose Arthur what?

965
00:55:52,444 --> 00:55:56,304
Suppose Arthur came back to you,
is that what you're thinking?

966
00:55:59,044 --> 00:56:01,104
If he did, you'd take him,
wouldn't you?

967
00:56:04,165 --> 00:56:05,665
Poor Margaret.

968
00:56:07,165 --> 00:56:09,724
In a week, you will be driving
with this woman in the park.

969
00:56:10,564 --> 00:56:14,605
She'll be constantly in your house,
she'll become your closest friend.

970
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:17,684
You're right, my dear,
you have no courage.

971
00:56:17,845 --> 00:56:19,859
- Please, give me time to think.
- No.

972
00:56:21,524 --> 00:56:25,832
Our moment came, you refused it.
Now it is gone.

973
00:56:27,325 --> 00:56:30,431
Our lives touched.
They'll never touch again.

974
00:56:30,444 --> 00:56:32,314
I'm leaving England tomorrow.

975
00:56:34,085 --> 00:56:35,276
Goodbye, Margaret.

976
00:56:46,405 --> 00:56:47,938
Isn't that Darlington?

977
00:56:50,884 --> 00:56:53,404
Oh, Arabella, allow me
to introduce Mrs. Erlynne.

978
00:56:53,437 --> 00:56:54,444
Good evening, Duchess.

979
00:56:54,485 --> 00:56:57,280
I think next to your brother,
I am your most fervent admirer.

980
00:56:57,285 --> 00:57:00,771
He talks about you so often. Everybody
knows what a brilliant talker he is.

981
00:57:00,805 --> 00:57:03,325
Everyone knows where he gets it from,
of course, it runs in the family.

982
00:57:03,485 --> 00:57:05,405
As a matter of fact, the last time
I was in Monte Carlo

983
00:57:05,564 --> 00:57:08,085
they were all quoting your absolutely
deathless remarks.

984
00:57:08,285 --> 00:57:10,565
Were they really? In Monte Carlo?
You must tell me.

985
00:57:10,725 --> 00:57:12,725
- Agatha?
- Yes, Mama?

986
00:57:12,885 --> 00:57:14,685
Have you kept the last three dances
for Mr. Hopper?

987
00:57:14,845 --> 00:57:17,045
- Yes, Mama.
- Could I possibly have this dance too?

988
00:57:17,205 --> 00:57:19,165
I doubt that she has one left,
but we can ask her.

989
00:57:19,325 --> 00:57:21,285
- Have you this dance left, Agatha?
- Yes, Mama.

990
00:57:21,445 --> 00:57:24,405
You're indeed in luck, Mr. Hopper.
Take care of my little chatterbox.

991
00:57:24,429 --> 00:57:26,006
What charming things you say,
Mrs. Erlynne.

992
00:57:26,103 --> 00:57:28,191
Tell me more about Monte Carlo.

993
00:57:28,204 --> 00:57:31,169
- Isn't this our dance, dear lady?
- I wish it were, Augustus, but

994
00:57:31,484 --> 00:57:34,023
our host insists on dancing with me.

995
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:35,564
Duchess.

996
00:57:38,445 --> 00:57:41,626
Don't look so dismal, Arthur.
Everything is going beautifully.

997
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:43,645
From tonight,
the odds are greatly reduced.

998
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,965
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what you mean.

999
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:48,685
The odds against my being received into
London society were a hundred to one.

1000
00:57:48,845 --> 00:57:52,285
Tonight I have been received
by your wife, my position is secure

1001
00:57:52,445 --> 00:57:54,405
and Lord Augustus
is ripe for the plucking.

1002
00:58:01,005 --> 00:58:03,724
I cannot imagine what made Margaret
ask you here tonight.

1003
00:58:03,925 --> 00:58:06,085
- I don't know what will come of it.
- Nothing but good.

1004
00:58:06,245 --> 00:58:08,325
I'm planning to have
a little talk with Margaret.

1005
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,525
Please don't,
please don't cause us any more trouble.

1006
00:58:10,724 --> 00:58:14,245
Would it cause more trouble if she
understood about those checks to me?

1007
00:58:14,405 --> 00:58:16,325
What will you tell her?

1008
00:58:16,525 --> 00:58:19,205
How pleasant it is to have a son-in-law
who dances so well.

1009
00:58:19,364 --> 00:58:21,125
What are you going to tell her?

1010
00:58:21,284 --> 00:58:23,445
Leave it to me.
I never rehearse my conversations.

1011
00:58:23,604 --> 00:58:27,044
It will be some heart-warming little story
about your friendship for Augustus.

1012
00:58:27,205 --> 00:58:29,285
Arthur, I must tell you
everyone is remarking

1013
00:58:29,445 --> 00:58:31,564
what a handsome couple
you and Mrs. Erlynne make.

1014
00:58:31,725 --> 00:58:34,765
How civilized of poor dear Margaret
not to be jealous!

1015
00:58:34,925 --> 00:58:36,605
- Agatha.
- Yes, Mama.

1016
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:38,845
- Come here, Agatha.
- Yes, Mama.

1017
00:58:39,045 --> 00:58:41,245
- Has Mr. Hopper...
- Yes, Mama.

1018
00:58:41,405 --> 00:58:43,845
- And what answer did you give him?
- Yes, Mama!

1019
00:58:44,005 --> 00:58:47,005
Did you hear that, Mrs. Erlynne?
Dear Agatha always says the right thing.

1020
00:58:47,165 --> 00:58:48,685
Mr. Hopper, come here!

1021
00:58:48,885 --> 00:58:51,887
Agatha has told me everything.
How cunningly you two kept your secret!

1022
00:58:52,004 --> 00:58:53,742
You may kiss me, Mr. Hopper.

1023
00:58:55,405 --> 00:58:57,525
You don't mind my taking Agatha
off to Australia, Duchess?

1024
00:58:57,685 --> 00:59:00,525
Australia, with all those horrid
kangaroos crawling about?

1025
00:59:00,685 --> 00:59:03,318
We'll talk about that tomorrow.
You must come at lunch, of course.

1026
00:59:03,352 --> 00:59:06,075
- You'll join us, won't you, Mrs. Erlynne?
- With pleasure, Duchess.

1027
00:59:06,108 --> 00:59:07,924
- Well, run along, children.
- Yes, Mama.

1028
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:11,725
Till tomorrow then, at luncheon.

1029
00:59:11,884 --> 00:59:13,767
Aren't we going to dance at last?

1030
00:59:13,831 --> 00:59:16,506
I believe the next one's a polka
and I just learned it.

1031
00:59:16,605 --> 00:59:19,959
I can hardly wait,
but first I want to talk to our hostess.

1032
00:59:25,405 --> 00:59:28,032
Oh, Mr. Graham?
Have you seen Lady Windermere?

1033
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,718
Look for Lord Darlington
if you wish to find Lady Windermere.

1034
00:59:31,752 --> 00:59:34,125
And look for Lady Windermere
if you wish to find Lord Darlington.

1035
00:59:34,285 --> 00:59:36,205
So much information
based on so little evidence

1036
00:59:36,365 --> 00:59:38,445
is always the mark
of a spiteful mind.

1037
00:59:38,644 --> 00:59:40,480
You should be more careful, Mr. Graham.

1038
00:59:45,925 --> 00:59:47,525
Would you take me
to Lady Windermere, please?

1039
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:50,925
I believe her ladyship is out on
the balcony. I just took her cloak to her.

1040
00:59:51,085 --> 00:59:52,045
Is she alone?

1041
00:59:52,149 --> 00:59:54,173
I believe so, madam.
Lord Darlington left a while ago.

1042
01:00:50,005 --> 01:00:51,125
Yes, madam?

1043
01:00:51,285 --> 01:00:53,445
Are you quite sure you don't know
where Lord Darlington is?

1044
01:00:53,605 --> 01:00:55,085
He attended
Lady Windermere's ball tonight.

1045
01:00:55,245 --> 01:00:58,044
I know that! Would he have gone
to his club, perhaps?

1046
01:00:58,205 --> 01:00:59,165
I couldn't say, madam.

1047
01:00:59,325 --> 01:01:01,484
Will you go to club and see if he's there?
It's most important.

1048
01:01:01,685 --> 01:01:03,165
- Take a cab.
- Very well, madam.

1049
01:01:03,325 --> 01:01:05,365
- Oh, there he is now.
- I'm afraid not.

1050
01:01:05,565 --> 01:01:08,325
His lordship always uses his latch key.

1051
01:01:10,845 --> 01:01:14,805
- I'm sorry, Lord Darlington is not at home.
- Good.

1052
01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:20,325
- Please, do what I told you.
- Wait, where are you going?

1053
01:01:20,485 --> 01:01:22,365
To get a cab
and see if his lordship is at the club.

1054
01:01:22,525 --> 01:01:26,164
That will not be necessary. But get
the cab and wait at the corner, please.

1055
01:01:26,325 --> 01:01:27,285
Very good, madam.

1056
01:01:27,445 --> 01:01:30,485
- I'm so glad I found you.
- What do you mean by interfering?

1057
01:01:30,605 --> 01:01:33,605
Lady Windermere, you must leave here.
You mustn't make this terrible mistake.

1058
01:01:33,805 --> 01:01:38,248
- How do you know what I'm going to do?
- Oh, I know these things. Too well.

1059
01:01:38,845 --> 01:01:42,205
Did Arthur send you?
Is he afraid of the scandal?

1060
01:01:42,351 --> 01:01:43,853
No, he doesn't know you're here.

1061
01:01:44,277 --> 01:01:46,465
I told him you'd gone to your room
with a headache.

1062
01:01:47,765 --> 01:01:50,820
Go back to your husband.
Don't throw away his love.

1063
01:01:50,965 --> 01:01:52,924
The day may come
when you will starve for love.

1064
01:01:53,085 --> 01:01:55,528
You go back to my husband, he's yours.

1065
01:01:56,005 --> 01:01:59,125
I must say after seeing you tonight
I understand him only too well.

1066
01:01:59,325 --> 01:02:02,205
- You're quite irresistible, Mrs. Erlynne.
- Please go back home.

1067
01:02:02,365 --> 01:02:04,805
I shall stay here with the man
who has offered me his life.

1068
01:02:04,965 --> 01:02:09,524
Yes, he offers you his life
and then he takes yours and destroys it.

1069
01:02:10,582 --> 01:02:13,748
I've learned that.
I've learned that too well.

1070
01:02:14,685 --> 01:02:18,778
Listen to me.
We do silly things when we are hurt.

1071
01:02:18,812 --> 01:02:21,670
Don't spoil your beautiful young life
on my account.

1072
01:02:21,703 --> 01:02:23,485
Your husband loves you
and in your heart you know it.

1073
01:02:23,685 --> 01:02:26,365
What do you know about hearts?
Women like you have no hearts.

1074
01:02:26,565 --> 01:02:28,565
They're bought and sold.

1075
01:02:30,285 --> 01:02:32,045
Perhaps...

1076
01:02:32,205 --> 01:02:34,884
But can you imagine yourself
trying to live by your wits?

1077
01:02:35,045 --> 01:02:37,605
Trying to fight against a world
that wants none of you?

1078
01:02:37,764 --> 01:02:39,684
That will allow you no place in it?

1079
01:02:39,845 --> 01:02:44,325
Think of yourself if you can,
despised and ignored by every woman.

1080
01:02:44,484 --> 01:02:48,365
Think of the men who look at you,
guessing and making bets about you.

1081
01:02:48,525 --> 01:02:50,725
Don't worry, Mrs. Erlynne,
that won't happen to me.

1082
01:02:50,885 --> 01:02:54,725
I thought that too but it could
happen to you just as it happened to me.

1083
01:02:54,924 --> 01:02:57,789
I was just as young as you,
just as beloved,

1084
01:02:58,453 --> 01:02:59,840
just as mistaken.

1085
01:03:00,404 --> 01:03:03,405
But you... you'd be lost, child,
you couldn't stand it.

1086
01:03:03,564 --> 01:03:05,285
There is only one thing
that I can't stand...

1087
01:03:05,445 --> 01:03:07,565
Don't say it, it isn't true.
I mean nothing to Arthur.

1088
01:03:07,725 --> 01:03:10,085
The money that he gave me
was really a gift from Augustus

1089
01:03:10,205 --> 01:03:13,485
who didn't want to write his own checks
because he was afraid of his sister.

1090
01:03:13,645 --> 01:03:16,645
You're most accomplished
at clever little stories, Mrs. Erlynne.

1091
01:03:16,805 --> 01:03:20,485
I hate to admit this but you're jealous
of a woman who could be your mother.

1092
01:03:20,936 --> 01:03:22,066
Don't mention that name.

1093
01:03:23,724 --> 01:03:26,079
You're devoted to her memory,
aren't you?

1094
01:03:27,885 --> 01:03:29,286
Think of her now.

1095
01:03:30,444 --> 01:03:32,650
Think what she would say
if she were alive.

1096
01:03:33,165 --> 01:03:35,061
She would tell you to go back
to your husband,

1097
01:03:35,544 --> 01:03:36,939
that your place is with him.

1098
01:03:39,325 --> 01:03:40,723
I don't understand.

1099
01:03:41,592 --> 01:03:43,410
What makes you say all this?

1100
01:03:43,925 --> 01:03:45,937
I once ruined a man's life,

1101
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:48,058
just as you're about to ruin Arthur's.

1102
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:51,783
But we don't ruin a life
and go scot-free.

1103
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:54,848
We ruin ourselves
from the moment we do it.

1104
01:03:56,084 --> 01:03:59,971
I don't want anyone
to stand in front of you one day

1105
01:04:00,165 --> 01:04:03,410
and tell you that you're a woman
that can be bought and sold.

1106
01:04:12,284 --> 01:04:14,652
Come, I'll take you home.

1107
01:04:26,725 --> 01:04:29,552
- I want you at nine o'clock tomorrow.
- Yes, m'lord.

1108
01:04:30,445 --> 01:04:32,045
Come, quick.

1109
01:04:32,885 --> 01:04:34,645
My cloak!

1110
01:04:37,565 --> 01:04:39,805
- Good night, Robinson.
- Good night, m'lord.

1111
01:05:05,005 --> 01:05:07,684
Robert, old boy! Whoa, cabbie!

1112
01:05:07,845 --> 01:05:11,285
- Augustus, what are you up to?
- Come on to the club for a drink.

1113
01:05:11,445 --> 01:05:14,805
- I just came from there. It's closed.
- Closed at two? That's ridiculous.

1114
01:05:14,964 --> 01:05:16,365
Let's all go to the Cafe Royal.

1115
01:05:16,565 --> 01:05:18,645
In my opinion, we all need
a good night's sleep.

1116
01:05:18,804 --> 01:05:21,045
- A very good idea.
- You may well talk, a married man!

1117
01:05:21,205 --> 01:05:23,165
Arthur, you're coming along with us
to a bachelor's.

1118
01:05:23,365 --> 01:05:26,685
- How about having a drink with you?
- Of course, come in.

1119
01:05:27,844 --> 01:05:30,324
Let's go out through the back door.

1120
01:05:49,405 --> 01:05:50,805
Hoskins?

1121
01:05:52,804 --> 01:05:54,205
Hoskins?

1122
01:05:56,765 --> 01:05:59,045
I'm afraid we shall have to wait
upon ourselves. I can't find Hoskins.

1123
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:00,764
- Soda or water?
- Water, please.

1124
01:06:00,925 --> 01:06:02,885
Robert, we were just saying
what a great evening we all had.

1125
01:06:03,045 --> 01:06:04,765
- Yes, delightful.
- No, no, no. Don't drown it.

1126
01:06:04,925 --> 01:06:06,925
Make mine a small one.
I really must go home in a moment.

1127
01:06:07,084 --> 01:06:08,285
I shouldn't leave Margaret alone.

1128
01:06:08,444 --> 01:06:11,405
Don't go yet, old man.
You'll only weaken her.

1129
01:06:11,565 --> 01:06:14,605
- Was Margaret not feeling well?
- She had a headache.

1130
01:06:14,764 --> 01:06:16,605
Probably the excitement
of her first ball.

1131
01:06:16,725 --> 01:06:18,165
Probably.

1132
01:06:18,324 --> 01:06:20,485
By the way, why did you leave
so early tonight, Robert?

1133
01:06:20,645 --> 01:06:25,285
I had some other important matters to
attend to, I'm leaving England tomorrow.

1134
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:28,484
- Isn't it very sudden?
- Quite. Would you care to play cards?

1135
01:06:28,645 --> 01:06:32,525
I can't. I promised Mrs. Erlynne
never to gamble or drink again.

1136
01:06:32,724 --> 01:06:34,364
He's actually keeping half his vow.

1137
01:06:34,565 --> 01:06:36,725
That's the worst of women,
they're always reforming men.

1138
01:06:37,153 --> 01:06:39,005
Yes, they always find us bad.

1139
01:06:39,372 --> 01:06:42,181
I don't think we men are bad,
I think we're all good.

1140
01:06:42,215 --> 01:06:43,795
No, we're all in the gutter.

1141
01:06:43,852 --> 01:06:45,810
But some of us are looking at the stars.

1142
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:50,885
- You're very romantic tonight, Robert.
- You must be in love. Who's the girl?

1143
01:06:51,045 --> 01:06:54,124
- Come on, Robert. You can trust us.
- Who is she?

1144
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:58,165
The woman I love is not free...

1145
01:06:59,045 --> 01:07:00,405
...or thinks she isn't.

1146
01:07:00,564 --> 01:07:02,805
Don't let it worry you.
There are only two tragedies in life.

1147
01:07:03,005 --> 01:07:05,485
One is not getting what one wants,
the other is getting it.

1148
01:07:05,644 --> 01:07:08,124
- Come on, Augustus, I'll take you home.
- I don't want to go home yet.

1149
01:07:08,285 --> 01:07:12,405
- Don't be silly.
- This is the best joke of the season.

1150
01:07:12,565 --> 01:07:14,245
Augustus, don't be a fool.
Don't you realize...

1151
01:07:14,365 --> 01:07:16,884
He's talking of pure love
but has a woman in his room.

1152
01:07:17,045 --> 01:07:19,565
My fan! They found my fan!

1153
01:07:19,725 --> 01:07:21,645
- Show him the fan!
- What fan?

1154
01:07:21,805 --> 01:07:23,125
Show us, Cecil. Come on.

1155
01:07:23,285 --> 01:07:26,045
Perfectly ridiculous,
it must be some mistake.

1156
01:07:30,805 --> 01:07:33,045
It's my wife's fan,
there can't be any mistake.

1157
01:07:40,285 --> 01:07:42,964
Arthur, I assure you I have no idea
how that fan got here.

1158
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:46,005
- That's no explanation. You must know.
- I'm sorry but I don't.

1159
01:07:46,885 --> 01:07:49,684
Then you certainly won't object
to my searching your rooms.

1160
01:07:49,885 --> 01:07:53,285
I'm afraid I must object.
You cannot search my rooms...

1161
01:07:53,445 --> 01:07:56,445
You swine!

1162
01:07:56,645 --> 01:08:00,525
Here, take my fan
and leave the rest to me.

1163
01:08:01,204 --> 01:08:02,605
Come, come.

1164
01:08:05,765 --> 01:08:07,805
I'm going up these stairs.

1165
01:08:10,845 --> 01:08:14,165
Will you let go of me!
I'll not leave here...

1166
01:08:16,165 --> 01:08:19,205
I'm so sorry, I think I left my fan here.

1167
01:08:19,365 --> 01:08:21,245
Oh, there it is.

1168
01:08:23,165 --> 01:08:24,485
No, this is isn't mine.

1169
01:08:24,644 --> 01:08:27,725
Well, isn't that stupid of me?
This is Lady Windermere's fan.

1170
01:08:27,925 --> 01:08:30,525
I must have mistaken it for my own
when I was leaving the ball.

1171
01:08:30,684 --> 01:08:35,125
I'm so sorry. Will you please return
this to your wife, Lord Windermere?

1172
01:08:35,285 --> 01:08:40,165
Please send mine to my house before
tomorrow night as I'm leaving for Paris.

1173
01:08:44,085 --> 01:08:47,844
- Could your man escort me home?
- Yes, of course.

1174
01:08:48,885 --> 01:08:51,645
And Augustus, would you tell
your sister, the Duchess

1175
01:08:51,804 --> 01:08:55,205
that I shall be unable to lunch
with her tomorrow? Thank you.

1176
01:09:09,885 --> 01:09:13,685
- Did the young lady, I mean...
- Yes, madam. I put her in the cab.

1177
01:09:13,884 --> 01:09:16,084
You would be doing your master
real service

1178
01:09:16,245 --> 01:09:18,845
by not telling him that there was
another lady in the house tonight.

1179
01:09:19,005 --> 01:09:20,445
I understand, madam.

1180
01:09:26,085 --> 01:09:27,445
Good morning, Dawson.

1181
01:09:27,604 --> 01:09:29,524
Good morning, m'lord.
I had no idea Your Lordship was up.

1182
01:09:29,685 --> 01:09:32,365
I slept in the study. Have any of you
found a fan? Someone left it here.

1183
01:09:32,525 --> 01:09:34,965
A fan? I don't think so, m'lord.
At least, not yet.

1184
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:37,325
Several of the ladies left
various gloves and handkerchiefs

1185
01:09:37,484 --> 01:09:40,525
and her grace, the Duchess of Berwick
left a galosh, but I've seen no fan.

1186
01:09:40,685 --> 01:09:41,805
I will enquire of the others.

1187
01:09:41,965 --> 01:09:44,445
Tell them to try and keep quiet,
I don't want her ladyship to be disturbed.

1188
01:09:44,605 --> 01:09:47,005
Her ladyship left the house
half an hour ago, m'lord.

1189
01:09:47,165 --> 01:09:50,045
- Did she say where she was going?
- No, m'lord.

1190
01:09:50,205 --> 01:09:52,725
Very well. Try and find the fan.

1191
01:09:54,885 --> 01:09:56,925
Rosalie, did her ladyship say
where she was going?

1192
01:09:57,085 --> 01:09:59,805
- She was going to deliver a package.
- What package?

1193
01:09:59,965 --> 01:10:03,165
It was a fan, my Lord. Her ladyship
had me put it in a small box for her.

1194
01:10:03,284 --> 01:10:04,306
Thank you, Rosalie.

1195
01:10:12,765 --> 01:10:15,598
My dear child, you've come to see me.

1196
01:10:16,294 --> 01:10:18,932
It's hard to believe. It's lovely to believe.

1197
01:10:18,966 --> 01:10:21,725
I had to see you. I can't accept
your sacrifice, it's too much.

1198
01:10:21,826 --> 01:10:23,611
You must be calm.
Come and sit down.

1199
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:29,108
- You look pale.
- I don't mean to.

1200
01:10:29,245 --> 01:10:32,000
- Didn't you sleep well?
- No, of course I didn't.

1201
01:10:32,034 --> 01:10:33,845
Mrs. Erlynne,
think what you did last night.

1202
01:10:34,004 --> 01:10:37,276
You threw away all your hopes,
all your safety. All your life.

1203
01:10:37,309 --> 01:10:40,205
What does a child like you know about
my hopes and my safety?

1204
01:10:40,365 --> 01:10:44,470
I saw you ruin them just to save me.
Why did you do it?

1205
01:10:44,805 --> 01:10:48,364
Perhaps because your hopes
and your safety and your life

1206
01:10:48,605 --> 01:10:49,928
are more precious than mine.

1207
01:10:50,724 --> 01:10:54,210
Or perhaps it was because
I'm very fond of you, Lady Windermere.

1208
01:10:54,243 --> 01:10:56,725
I can't let you do it.
I'm going to tell Arthur everything.

1209
01:10:56,885 --> 01:10:59,445
- No, you mustn't dream of doing that.
- But I owe it to you.

1210
01:11:00,525 --> 01:11:04,119
If you think you owe me something,
pay me by silence.

1211
01:11:04,245 --> 01:11:07,382
Don't spoil the one good thing
I've done in my life by telling it.

1212
01:11:07,725 --> 01:11:09,834
I know your mother would think that.

1213
01:11:10,045 --> 01:11:13,371
I know that she'd want above all
that you keep Arthur happy.

1214
01:11:14,085 --> 01:11:16,402
I think your father would want that too.

1215
01:11:17,285 --> 01:11:19,937
Yes, I know he would want
my happiness.

1216
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:23,132
He had so little happiness himself
after my mother died.

1217
01:11:23,165 --> 01:11:25,444
He loved her very much.

1218
01:11:25,768 --> 01:11:28,108
They say people don't die
of broken hearts,

1219
01:11:28,205 --> 01:11:29,715
but I know that he did.

1220
01:11:33,165 --> 01:11:35,245
As you see, I'm packing again.

1221
01:11:35,645 --> 01:11:38,005
Packing and unpacking,
that's the rhythm of my life.

1222
01:11:38,165 --> 01:11:42,164
I'm rather glad. London is too full
of fogs and serious people.

1223
01:11:42,325 --> 01:11:44,193
Whether the fogs produce
serious people, or

1224
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:46,363
the serious people produce fogs,
I don't know.

1225
01:11:47,165 --> 01:11:50,169
Oh, there's your carriage.
And there's your Arthur.

1226
01:11:50,202 --> 01:11:53,261
Good, at least I can tell him
how foolish I was to suspect him.

1227
01:11:53,295 --> 01:11:54,833
You'll do nothing of the kind.

1228
01:11:55,405 --> 01:11:58,551
Not that you are not foolish,
but to admit it and to a husband...

1229
01:11:59,125 --> 01:12:00,525
Never.

1230
01:12:02,884 --> 01:12:06,845
Here, I came to give you back your fan
and I've forgotten to do it.

1231
01:12:07,845 --> 01:12:10,205
I'd rather like you to keep it,
to remember me by.

1232
01:12:10,365 --> 01:12:12,063
Oh, I should love to have it.

1233
01:12:13,045 --> 01:12:16,121
I hate to say this...
Goodbye, Lady Windermere.

1234
01:12:18,045 --> 01:12:21,636
- You'll write to me perhaps?
- I don't think so, child.

1235
01:12:21,669 --> 01:12:25,642
Our lives will lie so very far apart.
We belong to different worlds, you know.

1236
01:12:25,845 --> 01:12:28,021
I used to think that,
now I know better.

1237
01:12:29,139 --> 01:12:30,960
There's the same world for all of us.

1238
01:13:23,445 --> 01:13:27,085
Yes, I tore up
Lord Windermere's check.

1239
01:13:27,805 --> 01:13:29,805
Perhaps I shouldn't have.

1240
01:13:29,965 --> 01:13:33,964
But it gave me so much pleasure to do it
that I have never regretted it.

1241
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:38,884
Oh, I've needed the money
a thousand times.

1242
01:13:39,045 --> 01:13:44,285
But I've learned a thousand times
that money isn't very much.

1243
01:13:44,445 --> 01:13:46,463
Yes, if it could buy back your twenties,

1244
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,577
or your thirties, or your forties.

1245
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:51,025
Even your sixties!

1246
01:13:52,525 --> 01:13:55,565
How did we come to talk about all this?

1247
01:13:55,725 --> 01:13:59,085
The fan. You know, the fan
you found at the auction.

1248
01:13:59,245 --> 01:14:02,365
Oh yes, and I was so proud
of my memory.

1249
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:06,324
Now I've gone and forgotten
what happened just this morning.

1250
01:14:06,485 --> 01:14:11,365
You know, I always wondered
why you were at my house that night.

1251
01:14:11,525 --> 01:14:16,604
- In fact, sometimes I almost thought...
- You thought I came to see you?

1252
01:14:16,765 --> 01:14:20,724
Oh, what indestructible vanity.

1253
01:14:20,885 --> 01:14:21,936
No, my dear.

1254
01:14:22,033 --> 01:14:25,920
Every other woman in London,
I don't doubt, but not me.

1255
01:14:27,925 --> 01:14:32,887
Mrs. Erlynne, I find we have
so many things to talk about.

1256
01:14:33,365 --> 01:14:37,285
It would give me great pleasure
if you would dine with me one evening.

1257
01:14:37,445 --> 01:14:41,085
Robert, Robert, we're grown-up now.

1258
01:14:41,245 --> 01:14:43,747
Besides, my dear,
you must save your coupons.

1259
01:14:45,205 --> 01:14:48,241
I shall be so happy
to have the fan again.

1260
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:51,391
After Margaret had gone
home that morning,

1261
01:14:52,115 --> 01:14:54,938
she sent me a bouquet
of red and white roses

1262
01:14:55,844 --> 01:14:58,105
and her fan in the mother-of-pearl box,

1263
01:14:59,387 --> 01:15:01,021
the fan with her name on it.

1264
01:15:02,685 --> 01:15:05,765
- Come on, let's go and get it now.
- Oh, I...

1265
01:15:07,605 --> 01:15:12,844
Ready, m'lord. It's such a treat
to press a fine Cheviot nowadays.

1266
01:15:14,285 --> 01:15:16,365
Oh, I see.

1267
01:15:28,005 --> 01:15:29,965
Thank you, Simpson.

1268
01:15:30,124 --> 01:15:32,384
How easy life is for men!

1269
01:15:34,285 --> 01:15:37,803
A freshly pressed suit
and they're young again!

1270
01:15:42,645 --> 01:15:44,042
My dear.

1271
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:52,025
- Good day, Simpson.
- Good day, m'lord.
