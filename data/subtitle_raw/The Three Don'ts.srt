1
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:07,533
Sir,

2
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:09,767
the drugs... the key...
They've been stolen

3
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:12,333
Get Banger on the phone.

4
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:13,967
Now.

5
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:38,633
- Is it done?
- Tis, hai.

6
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,100
Sorted the fucking clowns
what robbed your merch.

7
00:00:43,233 --> 00:00:43,767
And your efforts
will be rewarded.

8
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:45,533
Fucking want to be, boss.

9
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:47,767
Do I need to remind you
of the Three Don'ts?

10
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,433
Hmph. You don't need
to tell me anything, boss.

11
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:52,900
I know the Three Don'ts
as good as anyone.

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,767
Aye and you learned
them from me.

13
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:55,667
So what's next?

14
00:00:57,767 --> 00:00:59,833
I'll call your boys,
organise the meet,

15
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:00,600
drop off the merch.
You can sort us out then.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,567
You didn't, uh,
find anything else, did you?

17
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:06,267
Uh, nah.

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,033
Not a thing boss.
Only the drugs.

19
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:10,167
You wouldn't lie to
me now, would you?

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,567
Hmph. Wouldn't
dream of it boss.

21
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:14,367
Fine.

22
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:17,333
Organise the meeting.
We'll chat soon.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,133
There ye go lads.

24
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:30,200
- Nice one man.
- Sound.

25
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,767
Look, it's a simple job

26
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:38,600
and we could be set
for life off the back of this.

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,900
How the fuck are we meant
to trust these lads?

28
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,433
I mean this sounds like some
seriously risky shit.

29
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:45,133
Of course it's fucking risky

30
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:47,400
but sure when has that
stopped you before

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,967
You go from A to B to get a bag of weed this is basically the same thing

32
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:49,667
No, No.

33
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:52,300
Only this time we're
getting paid.

34
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,400
No, No, No. Look. Yeah,
I get that but man

35
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:56,167
This sounds super fuckin...

36
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:57,033
The guys name is Banger!

37
00:01:58,367 --> 00:01:59,233
He's hardly a
trustworthy gentleman.

38
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,367
Jason: How the fuck do you
even know these lads?

39
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:07,167
Well, I don't really know them.

40
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,667
But they're supposed
to be grand.

41
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:12,133
I know them through Mickey. He
got a lot of yokes off them

42
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:13,533
Mickey? Yeah.

43
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,033
As in Ridley?

44
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,333
- Load of yokes.
- Yeah...

45
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:16,733
sound like a fucking
basket of kittens

46
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:22,433
Jason: Man... OK, look...

47
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:25,000
Call up these boys
and find out exactly what it is

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,267
that they want you to do.

49
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:28,967
Call them and find out. e?

50
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:30,667
Because college is the last of my worries,
if I end up in fucking jail.

51
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:39,133
Should you have a codename?

52
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,167
- What?
- Reservoir dogs shit.

53
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,667
I'm not using no codename.

54
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:45,333
What if the guards are
listening to the call?

55
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,000
Sure, how are the fucking boys
supposed to know it's me?

56
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,667
Just call them up and be like:

57
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,567
Well, this is B. They're
going to know it's you,

58
00:02:52,567 --> 00:02:53,133
they're expecting
a call for the job.

59
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,667
I am not using no codename.

60
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:02,667
: OK, OK. No codename.
But just do me a favour,

61
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:03,900
for the love of god

62
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,733
Please don't mention my name.

63
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:08,333
Grand.
Jason: I don't want these lads

64
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,767
- knowing anything about me. Alright?
- Grand, grand. Give me the phone.

65
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,233
Fucking tit.

66
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:34,433
- Well, who that? - Oi, Banger.
It's B. How're you doing?

67
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:43,300
B? I don't know any
fucking B's chief...

68
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,467
Didn't I tell you before,
I don't be dealing

69
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:46,500
with fucking initials.
Who the fuck are you?

70
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,533
Benson. Benson, I'm Harry's nephew.
He said you might have some work for me.

71
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,133
Harry's nephew. Yeah, Yeah.
Yeah, I might have something for you.

72
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,033
Where are you now?

73
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,567
Can you meet me there by the
old abandoned pub in Clonlara?

74
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,833
Just finishing off a pint here,
but I can be down there in about...

that alright with you?

76
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:06,467
Not a bother boss.
Will you be on your own?

77
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:09,167
Nah, I'll have my
mate Jason with me.

78
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:14,567
- What the fuck?
- Shut up you Gowl.

79
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,733
Twenty minutes now. No longer.
No later. Right.

80
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:18,300
Good luck.

81
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:23,133
- I told you not to mention my
name. - Sorry...

82
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,600
Nah, well, fucking...

these lads, you got us covered

00:04:32,033 --> 00:04:35,133

00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:37,167
Nah man. I bet if shit goes down,
you'll throw yourself like a sack of potatoes.

86
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:39,400
A sack of spuds?

87
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,200

88
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,067
Sack of fucking spuds... Ah no,

89
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:47,233
Ah, I didn't need that memory

00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:50,533

00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:13,767
I'm sure ye would ask the same thing if ye were in our positions.

118
00:06:15,433 --> 00:06:16,300
Just checking to see if he
had the balls to do it.

119
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,300
I've a bit of hating on me.

120
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,700
A few of the big boys,
you know, out to get me.

121
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,467
Last thing I want now is them catching me with a boot full of X.

122
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,367
Oh, ah, whoa, oh, hold on now.

123
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:27,267
Ah. What do you mean

00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:28,467

Good luck boys.

161
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,433
Man, you used to be way more fucking
fun when you went through college.

162
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:44,333
Don't give me that shit.
I've enough pressure on me.

163
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,133
Doesn't that usually go
the other way around

164
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:50,367
I've enough stress on me already

The boot is open.

173
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,000
You're some fucking
man, you know that?

174
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:24,133
What?

175
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,100
What is it?

176
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,333
Was it the smoke, was it?

177
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:04,333
Those fucking cunts...

178
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:40,433
- It's Banger.
- Well Banger... It's Benson.

179
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:44,300
Ah jesus, Benson lad, how're you
getting on? Are we rich yet?

180
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:48,267
No Banger, we're not
fucking rich yet.

181
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:51,200
We've got a problem,
that's what we've got.

182
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:54,133
What kind of a fucking problem?

183
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,400
The problem is,
instead of a boot full of X there's a boot full of

184
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,500
...Fucking bodies ya cunt!

185
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:04,300
Sounds to me like you didn't
follow the fucking Three Don'ts.

186
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,200
What was don't
number three Benson?

187
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,800
Hoi, don't mind that
fucking shit with me.

188
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,467
Don't look in the fucking boot.

189
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:13,533
You stupid fucking prick,
I'll fucking kill you.

190
00:11:13,533 --> 00:11:15,933
I'll rip your fucking
head off, you bastard,

191
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:17,867
- do ya hear me? I'll fuckin...
- Fucking tyre blew out, man.

192
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:18,400
I had to check the
boot for a spare.

193
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,700
Right.

194
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,167
There was probably a bit
of a mix up alright.

195
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:26,700
Seems like you got the
wrong car, wrong delivery.

196
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:30,033
All you have to do now is just
bury the two bodies.

197
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:34,367
You'll still get your money.

198
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:37,100
Here, no fucking disrespect at all right,
I signed up for a fucking courier job...

199
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:37,700
I didn't sign up to
be a gravedigger.

200
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:41,533
I don't think we
can do this, man.

201
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,467
Alright, Alright. Just dig
the fucking graves, alright

202
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:47,133
We'll be out. We'll
find ye. Alright.

203
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,067
Ye still get yer money, alright.
Deal? Deal? Deal?

204
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,100
Sure, yeah, yeah, yeah. Grand,
grand. There's fucking shovels

205
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,033
...in the boot.
Me and Jason will start beating into them now, ahm.

206
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,067
Will ye be able to find us?
Just stay put ye, alright.

207
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:02,733
We'll find ye.

208
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:12,600
- What's wrong with you?
- This. This is way too wrong...

209
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,200
Fuck that man, come on,
get back to digging.

210
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,500
Why would they help us?

211
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,100
Someone else fucked up

212
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,533
and gave us the wrong car.

213
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:22,200
We saw two dead
bodies and what...

214
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
now they're going to come out,

215
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,267
chuck the bodies in the graves,
pay us and we all go our seperate ways.

216
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:29,533
On what fucking planet does that sound
like something that would ever happen.

217
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:30,600
He... That lunatic sniffed me.

218
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:35,667
Ah, yer fucking right.

219
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,300
Fuck man...

220
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,133
What are we going to do?

221
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,467
I've got an idea.

222
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,233
- This is your fucking idea?
- What the fuck else are we meant to do?

223
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:52,767
We leave the boot
open, like it is...

224
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,100
They'll look at the bodies,
their backs turned

225
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,200
We spring out, catch
them off guard.

226
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,767
Spring out?

227
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,467
Who the fuck do you think you
are? Solid Snake Plissken?

228
00:13:01,467 --> 00:13:03,000
- Ah man. - Plus, there's only
three of them...

229
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,400
Only three of them?

230
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:06,133
Yeah.

231
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:10,167
Alright. It's not half bad,
I'll give you that.

232
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,100
Yeah. Yeah.

233
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:13,567
Catch them off guard.

234
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,067
Clean them out. Get in the car.

235
00:13:16,967 --> 00:13:17,567
Fuck right off.

236
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,233
Back to mine. I like it.

237
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,333
I'm taking Tic-Tac and Banger.

238
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,667
You handle that guy.

239
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,033
Fucking dirty moustache on him.
I want him.

240
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:30,667
Shut up. They're coming.

241
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:38,700
Oh. Tis a chilly
aul' night boys.

242
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:49,200
{unintelligble gibberis}

243
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,633
Disrespectful little shites.

244
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:54,600
We'll find them.

245
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:57,333
Sure they have to be out
here somewhere, don't they?

246
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,600
...Hoi Crunchie.

247
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:01,767

249
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:07,133

250
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:20,333

What's that?! Hoi, hoi,

00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,400

00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,167
Right. We got this...

254
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,067
We got this alright?
Right, three...

255
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,567

256
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:36,667
- Right, two... - I don't want
to die like this...

257
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,067
One.

258
00:14:40,067 --> 00:14:41,400
Killed by Pikeys in
the fuckin' woods.

259
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,633
Oh Fuck. Ahhh fuck.

260
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,567

What was the most important one?

276
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:13,600
What was it? Huh?

277
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,033

Don't ever mess with

What the fuck happened?

282
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,200
So what do we do now?

284

Fucking hell.

305
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,300
This would want to be
fucking good Conny Boy.

306
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,133
Well Francie,

307
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:49,367
did you hear from my no good bat shit of a brother from last night?

308
00:21:50,233 --> 00:21:51,800
Ha. Not at all. Why?

309
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,333
He was supposed to be
helping me, fucking,

310
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:57,400
shift the rugs up to
the boys up north

311
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,067
and fucking, not a
fucking sign of him now.

312
00:21:59,067 --> 00:21:59,567
Stupid prick like.

313
00:22:01,933 --> 00:22:02,533
Francie: Try fucking Banger so?

314
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,800
Do you think I've fucking
not tried Banger

315
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,267
already like, he's never
picking up his phone.

316
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:10,533
He's always banging some young one,
or snorting fucking coke like.

317
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:11,233
He never picks up his
fucking phone like.

318
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:14,633
I still don't get why you're
fucking calling me, hai.

319
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,333
Do you know who
they were like, meeting like,

00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:19,333
watch your fucking
tongue with me, lad

321
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:19,667
It's none of your
business, alright.

322
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:22,033
I'll send some lads over

323
00:22:22,033 --> 00:22:23,433

00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:24,700

Has it got to do with- You're getting on my last fucking nerve, alright?

327
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:33,100
You go out, look for the boys
and call me when you do.

328
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:36,600

Well love.

Come here to me,

Are you from Tenessee,

331
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,000
- Why? Cause I'm the only ten you see?
- Nah, cause you're a fucking state.

332
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,667
- Ah man.
- Just breathe. Easy.

333
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:50,133
What the fuck was that?

334
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:53,467
Drink the whiskey.

335
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:59,267
Get it down. Get it into ya.
Get it into ya.

336
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,533
Ahhhh Man!

00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,167
Fuck!

339
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,367
Ahhhh Benson.
I never meant to get ye caught up in all this kind of shit...

340
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,467
Don't this.

341
00:23:31,967 --> 00:23:33,800
- Ah man...
- Don't that.

342
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,300
I'm gonna die, aren't I?

343
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,300
Nah, you're not gonna die man.
We got you.

344
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:40,167
Well, he got you.

00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:43,267
You're alright.

346
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:49,467
Fuck you, ya cunt.

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,333
Alright,

348
00:23:53,033 --> 00:23:54,167
Ah man, Benson.

349
00:23:56,433 --> 00:23:57,600
You got the other guys brains
on your forehead.

350
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,233
What the fuck is wrong with you?

351
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,167
I've never seen brains before...

352
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:07,367
Jesus christ.
Will you just take some whiskey,

353
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:08,800

sit the fuck down.

354
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,367

365
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:24,267

366
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:29,200
Oh fucking jesus christ,
mother of mary, fucking hell!

367
00:25:30,733 --> 00:25:31,433
Tic. Tic.

368
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:35,033

369
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:36,767
Alright Come on.

370
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:49,067
Come on. Christ boy, you

371
00:26:17,633 --> 00:26:19,167

00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:21,867

374
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,767
I've no idea where
Banger or Crunchie are.

375
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:34,300
They fucking, the're all, I don't know man.
I's a fucked up situation like.

376
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,100
Hoi, Conny. You're not making fucking sense lad.

00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,233

00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,900
- Out for an early morning stroll is it?
- Who is it?!

381
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,733
Is it that fucking
blonde cunt is it?

382
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,500
{Stuttering & gibberis}

383
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:08,167
Daopan: K, this is bad.

384
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,667
How bad?

385
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:14,333
Daopan: Like dead
bodies bad. Everywhere!

386
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,767
I better bate off so.

387
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,367
I think we both know
tha's not going to happen.

388
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:27,400
- Usual job so. Kill them all.
- Unfortunately not.

389
00:27:28,867 --> 00:27:30,567
We need answers. We don't
find anything here

390
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:31,533

something out of them.

391
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:32,200
Grand.

392
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:48,200
No drugs. No key.

393
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:50,700
Some dead cunts no one
gives a fuck about.

394
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:05,067
Was that really necessary?

395
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:12,667
I'm thinking the place we dealt
with the mexican cartel?

396
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,967
Oh the place with
the Mannequins. Sweet!

00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:12,733
Paddy: He's fucking dead boss.

412
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:15,667
Poor fucker.

413
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:23,367
Shhh. Goodnight sweet prince.

414
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,467

00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:31,600

419
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:56,267
Paddy: It's Banger boss.

420
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,567
No. No. No. No. NO!

421
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,033
Fuck!

422
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:03,467
Fuck!

423
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:05,700

424
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:12,767
- Harty's fucking goons.
- Wha's that boss?

425
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:16,400
The chink. The blonde bitch.

426
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,500
Fucking heard them
when Conny phoned me, hai.

427
00:30:20,933 --> 00:30:21,767
Fuck!

428
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,633
What are we gonna
do about this boss?

429
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:27,567
I'll tell you what
we do't fucking do.

430
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:30,300
We do't let these pricks
get fucking away with it.

431
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:32,267
Nobody messes with a
fucking traveller.

432
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,500
Especially not my
fucking family.

433
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:38,667
You're not going to like
what 'm about to say but

434
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:41,667
I think I should contact your parents and let them know what happened.

435
00:30:43,033 --> 00:30:45,067
Are you off your
fucking trolley? No.

436
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,733
Man if my mother found out what I got myself into the other night

437
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,767
- She'd beat me worse than Crunchie did.
- I'll make ye a deal so.

438
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:55,600
If ye'll agree to it

439
00:30:57,533 --> 00:31:00,200
I won't tell anybody about
what happened with ye,

440
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,467
ye do't tell anybody
about this either? Deal?

441
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,033
Deal.

442
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,433
Alright. 'm gonna go out
and stick on a cuppa.

443
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:12,533
Try and heal yourself
or whatever, to fuck

444
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:14,100
Hoi har.

445
00:31:16,633 --> 00:31:18,500
Will these pills actually
heal his bruises

446
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,167
or will they make
his dick fall off?

447
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,267
What the fuck are you
talking about now Benson?

448
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,500
The pills man,

449
00:31:29,033 --> 00:31:33,133
- the're lacita. Laceta-
- Ah, ah. Use your words.

450
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:35,700
Lacitate.

451
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,400
He said something about them being for chemically castrating cattle.

452
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,700
And why would your uncle
give me something

453
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,033
for chemically
castrating cattle?

454
00:31:46,033 --> 00:31:47,267
Relax. 'm just
fucking with you

455
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:52,067
Ben Now is not the time, man

456
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:53,600
They are for animals though.

457
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:56,767
I's like a horse tranquilizer

458
00:31:59,133 --> 00:31:59,633
but for something bigger

459
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:01,767
Like an elephant

460
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:05,367
or that cunt that fought you.

461
00:32:12,967 --> 00:32:15,167
Alright, I need a jacket.

462
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:18,233
- What the fuck do you need a jacket for?
- Where are you going?

463
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,033
I's Tuesday.

464
00:32:21,167 --> 00:32:21,633
I need to sign on

465
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,733
and plus I ran out of weed
and I need to get some more.

466
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:27,733
Against all of my better
fucking judgement,

467
00:32:30,267 --> 00:32:32,233
the jackets are outside in the kitchen,
hanging to the left of the door

468
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,033
Thank you.

469
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:38,433
You're a good man.

470
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:40,500
Watch that.

471
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:43,767
Are't you glad I fucking
washed it for you.

472
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:45,800
You did.

473
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,233
My favourite hoodie.

474
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,100
You're a good man Harry.

475
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,733
Fuck sake

476
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:54,767
H's some fucking detail.

477
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,400
You'd see less smoke coming
off the genies arse in Aladdin.

478
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,333
No but,

479
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,633
like, his mother my sister.

480
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:09,867
I often thought about it
when she was pregnant

481
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:10,500
with himself, that she
was a bit you know,

482
00:33:12,733 --> 00:33:15,400
- medicated herself. Explains a
lot. -

483
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,100
- Why am I not surprised

484
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,000
- Any of ye need anything?
- I'm grand.

485
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:26,733
The will to live.

486
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:28,667
How about a packet
of Jaffa cakes?

487
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:30,633
I could't eat a
full pack though.

488
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,633
If you could get me like, four

489
00:33:36,033 --> 00:33:37,033
and some juice

490
00:33:38,733 --> 00:33:40,667
OK.
No bother.

491
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:45,633
Just sit there and try get
better. You want anything?

492
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:48,433
Harry: No but, tell Ter
I was asking for him.

493
00:33:50,233 --> 00:33:51,267
- I was't.
- Don't you owe him money?

494
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:53,767
I's best not mention
that to him.

495
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:57,200
- So long boys.
- Cheers! Good luck Ben.

496
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,433
You know, Ter knows
that you owe him money.

497
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:08,033
I'd just appreciate it not
being brought up again.

498
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:10,333
Boss wants this done
within the hour.

499
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,067
Lets get a lid on this shit
before it bubbles over.

500
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,267
Alright, lets wake this
motherfucker up then!

501
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:28,133
{Unintelligible Gibberis}

502
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:32,333
Hi there.

503
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:34,533
Just want to make this clear.

504
00:34:36,267 --> 00:34:39,367
This is not personal.
All business 'm afraid

505
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:43,767
So, don't read too much into
what we're going to do to you.

506
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:47,267
Well, what he's
going to do to you.

507
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,033
Let's get this started
on a friendly note.

508
00:34:51,067 --> 00:34:51,733
My name is Katherine and this

509
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:55,667
lovely gentleman
over here is Daopan.

510
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:56,367
My associate.

511
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:01,167
If his name sounds strange,
i's because h's from China.

512
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,033
He does't talk much
but h's very creative

513
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:09,633
in other ways.

514
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:11,533
So, I feel we've been
more than polite.

515
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:17,233
Where is the X, you've
stolen from my boss?

516
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,567
{Unintelligible Gibberis}

517
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:22,567
Pardon me?

518
00:35:27,433 --> 00:35:29,533
I think somethings getting
lost in translation here.

519
00:35:30,967 --> 00:35:32,233
Daopan? Did you get any of that?

520
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,367
I'm getting the gist of it,
but not the location of the X.

521
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:42,033
I have an idea.

522
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,400
OK, let's try this again.

523
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:59,700
Where are my bosses drugs?

524
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,367
{Unintelligible Gibberis}

525
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,200
Translation?

526
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:11,433
He basically said, you
and your Jackie Chan

527
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,667
lookalike boyfriend can
fuck off to Rush Hour

528
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:15,533
Now suck me right off,
you stupid blonde cunt.

529
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:17,633
{Unintelligible Gibberis}

530
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,533
Thanks. Good job not
breaking his neck.

531
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:29,133
Are you watching Enter
the Dragon again?

532
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:30,367
You know it girl, you know it

533
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,300
Last chance.

534
00:36:34,933 --> 00:36:36,400
Where is our merchandise?

535
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,033
Hm?

536
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:51,133
I was hoping we could
use our words.

537
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:54,267
Discuss this like adults...

538
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:57,233
But never mind

539
00:36:58,933 --> 00:36:59,733
Daopan

540
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,633
Where the fuck are the boys?

541
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:35,367
- The're all outside boss.
- Go out and get them so.

542
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:37,233
Right, not a bother

543
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:43,667
Francie, story boy.

544
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,200

546
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,033
Willy Harty's goons.

547
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,067
They even took fucking
Tic Tac and Conny Boy.

548
00:37:54,767 --> 00:37:55,500
Strong Willie: It's cause
of the drugs is't it?

549
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:58,067
I told them not to
mess with the Hartys.

550
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,667
Did some looking around Boss.
When we found them bodies.

551
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,100
The car out there,
belongs to Ben Yau.

552
00:38:08,867 --> 00:38:09,333
Who the fuck is he sure?

553
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,100
Sure he's fucking no one. Don't
be worrying about him. Alright.

554
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,733
H's some college
student or something.

555
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:15,167
I's his uncle boss.

556
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:18,000
- H's important.
- Who the fuck is he?

557
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,267
Harry fucking Clancy boss.

558
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,267
What the fuck does that
have to do with anything?

559
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:27,233
Clancy?

560
00:38:30,467 --> 00:38:31,233
He was working with Banger
on that job was't he?

561
00:38:33,467 --> 00:38:35,333
That means

562
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:35,733
He might know where
the fuck they are.

563
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,367
Or worse again,

564
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:39,433

working with them

565
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:42,533

00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,167

Fucking, they're about as useless as fucking tits on a nun, right.

So, as our interpreter is't
much use at the moment

619
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,100
I'm going to need a name
or a location

620
00:41:27,133 --> 00:41:30,267
or we're going to have to take another one.
How many do we have left?

621
00:41:32,567 --> 00:41:36,733
Uh, five fingers and two thumbs.
Thumbs aren't fingers, right?

622
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:39,500
Katherin: Once again,
you're correct.

623
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:44,367
OK then. One thumb

624
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:48,200
OK, w're going
to have to get creative.

625
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:52,267
H's not giving us anything.
Kill him, move onto the brother

626
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:55,333

00:41:58,267 --> 00:41:59,200

of using these guys.

629
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:04,300
W'll do you fast,
then move onto your brother and do him slow.

630
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,000
Conny Boy: Stop, no,
don't hurt my brother!

631
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,233
Fucking hell, I'll talk.

632
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,033
Who did it?

633
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:13,833
Conny Boy: Me and Madman,
we fucked up the tyres with a load of glass

634
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:16,200
and like we killed the two
boys and fucked them...

635
00:42:17,567 --> 00:42:20,633
...into the boot of the
car and fucking, I guess

636
00:42:20,633 --> 00:42:22,267
Madman had the bodies
in one and fucking...

637
00:42:23,633 --> 00:42:25,533
Banger had the X
in the other car.

638
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,500
{Unintelligible Gibberis}

639
00:42:30,733 --> 00:42:32,767
Which two gowls?

640
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:37,167
{Unintelligible Gibberis}

641
00:42:39,867 --> 00:42:41,967
H's useless. Kill him.

642
00:42:41,967 --> 00:42:47,100
Alright, alright, alright,
alright Fuck. Jesus. Fuck. Fuck.

643
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:57,200
{Unintelligible Gibberis}

644
00:43:04,633 --> 00:43:07,867
I need a name!

645
00:43:07,867 --> 00:43:12,233
Harry Clancy! Harry Clancy.

646
00:43:13,933 --> 00:43:14,700
Now fucking cut me loose.

647
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:17,567
Now was that so hard?

648
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:24,167
You should be rewarded.
With your freedom.

649
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,700
{Unintelligible Gibberis}

650
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,400
Freed from this mortal coil.

651
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:38,133
{Unintelligible Gibberis}

652
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:45,133
Fuck me. Talk about
a trigger warning.

653
00:43:46,467 --> 00:43:48,100
I wanted to do it.
You get all the fucking fun.

654
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,633
At least you got a name for the
fucking boss. Can I clean up?

655
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,067
Knock yourself out.

656
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,200
Lovely.

657
00:44:03,133 --> 00:44:05,733
Yep, sir. We have a name.
Harry Clancy.

658
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,800
Hello.

659
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,667
Mr. Clancy.

660
00:44:21,633 --> 00:44:22,767
Who the fuck is this? I know
i's not Banger anyway.

661
00:44:25,133 --> 00:44:26,500
Did you know that you can tell a lot by the sound of a mans voice

662
00:44:28,267 --> 00:44:30,767
...and you Harry are scared
but rest assured.

663
00:44:32,233 --> 00:44:33,633
You're not nearly scared enough.

664
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,267
What, what the fuck do you want?

665
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:41,167
I think you know as you
are in possession of it

666
00:44:42,033 --> 00:44:42,533
but not for much longer.

667
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:47,733
I know all about your history,
Harry Clancy.

668
00:44:47,733 --> 00:44:50,133
Look, this is about the
drugs isn't it? I mean

669
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,433
Yeah, tha's no problem.
You can take the drugs.

670
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:56,900
I'll even the two lads
that fucked everything

671
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,267
up I'll chuck them
under the bus as well.

672
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:03,600
Tha's all good.
I'll give you that shit and then I will fade away. I'm gone.

673
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,233
A man without loyalty and
honour. I'm surprised at you.

674
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,533
Especially with the
company that you keep.

675
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:12,367
I don't understand.

676
00:45:15,033 --> 00:45:15,767
I's not about the drugs.

677
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:21,767
Do not play coy with me,
lest I get temperamental.

678
00:45:21,767 --> 00:45:22,333
Look, I, I ca't.

679
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,533
There are things in this
business that you do and do't

680
00:45:29,633 --> 00:45:32,333
but i's the don'ts that are the most important.
Don't number one.

681
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,867
Don't ask stupid
fucking questions.

682
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:40,333
Don't number two. Don't fuck
around, get the job done

683
00:45:42,567 --> 00:45:46,433
And don't nimber three Don't stick your
nose in business that doesn't concern you.

684
00:45:48,867 --> 00:45:49,567
Bange's father used
to say something like that

685
00:45:51,433 --> 00:45:53,133
And what happened to him. He
got killed didn't he?

686
00:45:54,733 --> 00:45:55,600
Guess he couldn't
follow his own advice.

687
00:45:57,333 --> 00:45:59,167
You pissed off a lot
of people Harry.

688
00:46:02,133 --> 00:46:03,033
Goodbye Mr. Clancy.

689
00:46:04,267 --> 00:46:05,667
No wait, no, no, Please.

690
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:11,467

00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:57,733
We all do things we're
not proud of, sunshine

709
00:48:11,633 --> 00:48:13,133
For fuck sake!

710
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,333

711
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,000

712
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:00,767
Why's it so fucking dark in

00:49:09,433 --> 00:49:10,133
Hoi.

715
00:49:15,933 --> 00:49:16,767
What the fuck?
You could't wait for me, nah?

716
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:22,300
Man, why is my heart
beating so fast?!

717
00:49:23,633 --> 00:49:25,900
I dunno man, it could be
the buckets of cocaine...

718
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,467

Why did't you wait for me?

719
00:49:28,467 --> 00:49:32,433
What? Why is there

720
00:49:32,433 --> 00:49:33,267
There's something

721
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:44,367
Benson, I've never
taken coke before.

722
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:45,700
Yes you have.

723
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,100

00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,000

00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,100
Yeah, of course.

OK I do't

Neither do I.

728
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,200
But I got a feeling
this is no mistake.

729
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:01,367
A couple of shady looking fuckers just
pulled up outside and eyeballed the place.

730
00:50:01,367 --> 00:50:02,033

looking fuckers?!

737
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,033
Just go to the back door.

738
00:50:23,633 --> 00:50:25,633

Shut up you fucking eejit.

744
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,767

I mean Lord of the Rings had like ten different loose endings.

757
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,433
Our boss has spent a lot of time
and effort looking for this key.

758
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,433
So 'm, ah, sorry
to say lads but ah,

Graffiti outside. Can't miss it.

00:54:13,533 --> 00:54:15,067
Let's take a break in here,

789
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:16,700
Down the fucking
rabbit hole we go.

00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,633
Fuck.

791
00:54:42,467 --> 00:54:43,133
Shit.

00:54:50,133 --> 00:54:50,733
Your fucking skins?

795
00:54:52,133 --> 00:54:53,067
After what we just
fucking ran away from.

796
00:54:54,233 --> 00:54:55,133
Your worried about
rolling a fucking joint.

797
00:54:56,367 --> 00:54:58,167
You gotta be fucking joking me

798
00:55:01,767 --> 00:55:03,600
- I hope I didn't drop them when
we- - When we, when we what?

799
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,233
When we left the fucking
party back there?!

800
00:55:08,367 --> 00:55:11,833
I's logic, Benson. Alright.

801
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:13,333
If you do't have your skins,
you don't have them. You lost them.

802
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:15,100
Waters wet. You fucking prick.

803
00:55:19,267 --> 00:55:21,500
What? Ah man.

804
00:55:25,233 --> 00:55:26,167
I ripped my fucking pants.

00:55:29,467 --> 00:55:30,200
Oh, can this fucking
day get any worse?!

806
00:55:33,067 --> 00:55:34,800
No, no, no, no

807
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,867
We gotta find skins.

808
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:38,967
If we can find skins, I can
just roll us a big fat joint

809
00:55:38,967 --> 00:55:40,700
and we can just forget
this whole fucking thing.

810
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:41,567
Benson, you don't
even have weed.

811
00:55:42,067 --> 00:55:42,767
Oh no

812
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:44,267
Mysterious Voice: Hoi!

Fucking smoking his brains out.

816

You prick. None of this
would have happened without you.

00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:11,600
Be grand money.
Be an easy fucking job.

821
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,567
- I's all your fault. You know nothing.
- How is this fucking my fault? Huh?

822
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,400

Don't believe any of his

00:58:42,467 --> 00:58:45,033

874
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:28,067
Show up? Sure, I do't even
know who the fuck you are.

875
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,167
- Wha're you on about?
- You do't recognise me?

876
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,067
You and your boss did a little bit of work with me and my step brother.

877
00:59:35,067 --> 00:59:37,500
A lad by the name of Banger.

878
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,433
Did you hear about him at all,
you fucking yellow bastard ya.

879
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,300
Yeah? And what has
that to do with us?

880
00:59:41,767 --> 00:59:43,800
Your step brother
never showed up the other night

881
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:44,533
and w're here trying
to fix things while you

882
00:59:45,867 --> 00:59:48,033
fucking donkeys are throwing
spanners in the works.

883
00:59:48,033 --> 00:59:48,767
So yo're trying to say
you did't kill Banger boy.

884
00:59:49,767 --> 00:59:51,733
Don't mind that Bookie.

885
00:59:51,733 --> 00:59:52,533
They know the're fucked,
the'll say fucking anything.

886
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:54,300
H's telling the
truth, you imbecile.

887
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,167
Look, we didn't kill
Banger and his crew.

888
00:59:58,533 --> 01:00:00,967
Right, it was two lads working
with Harry Clancy

889
01:00:00,967 --> 01:00:01,733
and w're trying to get them
just as much as ye are

890
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,800
Maybe, uh, they did't
kill Banger so?

891
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,033
We did kill that special case
what couldn't talk properly,

892
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:08,733
remember that? That was
fucking brilliant

893
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:10,367
Ya fucking what?

01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:13,167
Ya killed Tic Tac, you

895
01:00:14,033 --> 01:00:14,700

896
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:26,033
Wha's the plan?

897
01:00:26,033 --> 01:00:28,433
The Usual.

898
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,200
Alright!

899
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:38,667

But he does

902
01:00:58,300 --> 01:00:58,700
Will you go out with me?

903
01:00:59,967 --> 01:01:00,767
No.

904
01:01:09,067 --> 01:01:09,767

Let him go you bastard!

908
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:43,233
You fucking bastard!

Let him go!

910
01:01:45,233 --> 01:01:47,133
Let him go

911
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,500
Let him go

912
01:02:06,767 --> 01:02:08,000
Did't anyone ever tell you not to mess with a fucking traveller?

913
01:02:09,867 --> 01:02:11,433
Your breath smells like shit

914
01:02:33,233 --> 01:02:34,600
Boss, you alright boss?

01:02:45,367 --> 01:02:46,767
Aye. Wouldn't see any need

01:03:42,133 --> 01:03:42,600
That was fucking quick.

932
01:03:45,533 --> 01:03:46,633
Ah man, I'm fucking wrecked

933
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:50,400

01:04:24,533 --> 01:04:27,233
You left us high and dry

943
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,300
and gypsys.

944
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:31,533
Why?

945
01:04:33,133 --> 01:04:33,667
You fucking spastic.

946
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:37,467
Assassins?

947
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,500
I think you've been watching too
many Quentin Tarantino Films.

948
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:45,367
What? Fucking cunt.

949
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:48,467
Can you please stop doing that?

950
01:04:49,567 --> 01:04:51,833
I've a woeful fucking migraine.

951
01:04:51,833 --> 01:04:52,767
Ah fucking shut up,
I'll do it again.

952
01:04:56,267 --> 01:05:00,167
So, care to share with the group

953
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,167
what was so important,
that you felt like selling our your nephew

954
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:05,500
and his best bud?

955
01:05:07,267 --> 01:05:08,067
You think you're
his best friend?

956
01:05:11,367 --> 01:05:13,067
He was way better friends than
you, trust me about that.

957
01:05:14,067 --> 01:05:16,600
Remember your one,

958
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,133
do you remember we were at the
party, the time at your gaff.

959
01:05:19,133 --> 01:05:20,700
Remember the blonde one,
she was good craic. She was a fucking friend.

960
01:05:22,067 --> 01:05:23,333
AWWW. You fucking cunt. Oh.

your mother should have
a-fuckin-borted ya, you cunt.

963
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,500

01:05:52,567 --> 01:05:53,467
Cunt.

968
01:05:55,433 --> 01:05:56,433
I's not fair is it.
I's not fair Jason.

969
01:05:58,633 --> 01:05:59,300
He does't deserve
to live, do he?

970
01:06:12,733 --> 01:06:15,300
- Wha's on the USB, Harry?
- What USB?

971
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:20,567
Oh, tha's I was transferring a
load of porn over for the trip,

972
01:06:20,567 --> 01:06:21,633
- ya know.
- Don't be smart.

973
01:06:21,633 --> 01:06:23,533
OH, I fucking know.

974
01:06:26,133 --> 01:06:28,667
Those assassin pricks the other day,
were't looking for the drugs Benson.

975
01:06:31,633 --> 01:06:33,700
They were looking for something
a bit more important.

976
01:06:36,167 --> 01:06:37,300
Something that YOU smashed

977
01:06:38,167 --> 01:06:40,333
and left me with.

978
01:06:45,133 --> 01:06:46,367
Wha's on the USB?

979
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:52,300
To be honest I ca't really
make out what you're saying.

980
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,667
Heads a bit foggy from all the fucking punches this clown was giving me

981
01:06:56,667 --> 01:06:57,633
Oh Yeah? 'll fucking
do it again now.

982
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:00,600
Look to your left.

983
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,233
Your other left you handicap.

984
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:09,500
For a fucking coward,
you're acting pretty fucking brave now, are't ya!

985
01:07:11,633 --> 01:07:12,567
Harry; Yeah,
well I guess stupidity runs in the fucking family.

986
01:07:16,267 --> 01:07:17,767
Ye lads haven't a fucking clue

987
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:22,300
Ye do't know what y've fucking
gotten yerselves into-

988
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:26,533
- Jay, what are you doing?
- Benson, will you shut the fuck, up!

989
01:07:27,867 --> 01:07:30,533
Harry, I have had it up to here

990
01:07:33,067 --> 01:07:37,167
with the bullshits and the mindgames
and the travellers and fucking everything!

991
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:39,133
Now you're gonna tell me

992
01:07:40,367 --> 01:07:41,800
You're cutting me,
you're cutting me

993
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,033
and my best friend,

01:07:46,767 --> 01:07:50,267
or I swear to god Harry,
I will saw your head off Harry.

995
01:07:50,267 --> 01:07:52,067
I will fuck you up.

996
01:07:53,367 --> 01:07:54,933
Come on!

997
01:07:54,933 --> 01:07:56,233
Stick it in his neck to fuck.

998
01:07:56,233 --> 01:07:57,067
End this shite now

999
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:00,500
and sure look, stick it in the chink and all.
He's no fucking good to you.

1000
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:02,600
Go home then to bed
and have a wank for yerself.

1001
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,000
What the fuck are you doing bringing this lunatic into my house?!

1002
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,700
Shut up! Jay, you alright?

1003
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,733
Man, fucking Banger

1004
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:23,167
H's been in my head,
ever since that cunt turned me into a dime bar.

1005
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:25,133
I'm losing my shit. Alright come
here. Fucking relax alright.

1006
01:08:25,133 --> 01:08:25,667
You're just fucking seeing him.

1007
01:08:26,967 --> 01:08:28,367
H's dead. Do you hear me?

1008
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,233
Come on, I need you here with me
Come on. Stay, come on!

1009
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:35,033
- Kiss and make up boys.
- Ohh, Shut the FUCK up!

1010
01:08:40,933 --> 01:08:42,133
I fucking knew he'd be bad like

1011
01:08:43,867 --> 01:08:45,333
but I did't think h'd be this
bad, not this fucking quick

1012
01:08:47,533 --> 01:08:49,400
What the fuck you talking about?
thought you patched him up?

1013
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,333
What the fuck did you do to him?

1014
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:55,233
I fucking Benson 'm a
fucking vet, not a surgeon.

1015
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,200
I mean, all I could do
was give him some pain meds,

1016
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:58,733
give him somewhere to rest up.

1017
01:09:00,367 --> 01:09:04,367
Hope like, three,
four, five days

1018
01:09:04,367 --> 01:09:06,400
was the max h'd get.
Which is why it kind of felt like not that big of a deal,

1019
01:09:07,933 --> 01:09:08,700
- to kind of leave him.
- Shut up.

1020
01:09:10,767 --> 01:09:11,300
I'm just saying.

1021
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:13,533
You're lying.

1022
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:16,467
You fucking sack of shit!

1023
01:09:18,367 --> 01:09:19,133
Benson,

1024
01:09:21,633 --> 01:09:23,533
I don't think the sack of shi's
lying this time around.

1025
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,467
Thank you! - Shut up.

1026
01:09:28,133 --> 01:09:28,767
I knew the minute I woke up.

1027
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:34,733
- I feel more beanbag than human
- Yo're still a fucking pussy,

1028
01:09:36,533 --> 01:09:38,767
You know I thought for a second,
I actually thought,

1029
01:09:38,767 --> 01:09:39,600
this cunt has a bit of balls
but sure look you don't.

1030
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:42,000
You're only a fucking gomey

1031
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,233
Do you ever fucking stop?

1032
01:09:46,033 --> 01:09:48,167
Look, right Benson

1033
01:09:50,133 --> 01:09:51,033
Like this guy that was
working with Banger.

1034
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:53,300
- He took my daughter alright.
- What?

1035
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,500
You have a daughter?

1036
01:09:59,733 --> 01:10:02,533
- I never knew - I never
wanted anyone to know because

1037
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,800
they could use it against me

1038
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,367
and tha's exactly
what this Man in Black has done.

1039
01:10:09,233 --> 01:10:12,633
- Like Will Smith?
- No, you fucking clown.

1040
01:10:12,633 --> 01:10:13,233
I's a perfectly
reasonable question

1041
01:10:14,533 --> 01:10:16,467
H's the main
distributor of drugs

1042
01:10:17,967 --> 01:10:19,467
coming in from the far east,
into the Irish market

1043
01:10:20,733 --> 01:10:24,267
and he is fucking bad news.
Just untie me

1044
01:10:26,733 --> 01:10:28,433
I'm not fucking joking around.
I know this guy.

1045
01:10:30,433 --> 01:10:33,500
My aim was to take this contact list,
tha's the USB that you have,

1046
01:10:35,433 --> 01:10:37,133
take that, trade it off,
get my daughter back

1047
01:10:39,133 --> 01:10:40,600
put all this to bed.
That was what I wanted.

1048
01:10:41,867 --> 01:10:42,333
What were you gonna do?

1049
01:10:45,467 --> 01:10:47,167
Huh? You were gonna just make
a sweet deal with him, was it?

1050
01:10:48,933 --> 01:10:50,000
And leave us here
leave ME here

1051
01:10:51,633 --> 01:10:53,567
and what? Fuck off to Lanzarote
or something, huh?!

1052
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:56,167
You were supposed to be
my family, you cunt!

1053
01:10:57,833 --> 01:11:00,467
I know.

1054
01:11:02,033 --> 01:11:03,467
I just ca't get it through
to you can I, please.

1055
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:05,633
If you untie me,

1056
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:08,667
we can all work together on
this. We can take this guy out.

1057
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:11,167
We can get my daughter
back, please.

1058
01:11:11,867 --> 01:11:12,367
Just listen to me.

1059
01:11:13,533 --> 01:11:14,333
Shut up.

1060
01:11:17,533 --> 01:11:18,733
You're a fucking
coward you know that.

1061
01:11:22,033 --> 01:11:23,700
Trying to weasel your way out
of everything you fucking do.

1062
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,767
Please! Help!

1063
01:11:29,767 --> 01:11:33,467
Benson, what the fuck
are we going to do?

1064
01:11:33,467 --> 01:11:36,700
- Shut up. - We need to shut him
the fuck up, now.

1065
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:39,000
Harry, this is your last
fucking chance. Shut up.

1066
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,700
Come on. Kill them
all. Simple job.

1067
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:42,667
The're fucking drugged out of
their minds, the mad pricks.

1068
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,733
Seriously, somebody fuckin...

1069
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:00,300
I think you killed him

1070
01:12:07,233 --> 01:12:09,533
- Yeah?
- Pizza for, uh, Harry Clancy?

1071
01:12:13,033 --> 01:12:13,633
Is it paid for?

1072
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:17,767
- Yeah? - Alright, Go on, slide
it through

1073
01:12:26,667 --> 01:12:28,200
What the fuck are you
still standing here for?

1074
01:12:29,567 --> 01:12:30,433
Tip?

1075
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,333
Yeah, alright.

1076
01:12:33,533 --> 01:12:34,233
I'll give you a fucking tip lad,

1077
01:12:36,433 --> 01:12:37,733
yeah. Here. Snort yourself
out for the evening.

1078
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,633
Tip? That's the
whole damn shaft!

1079
01:12:46,267 --> 01:12:47,000
H's gonna sleep tonight.

1080
01:12:49,467 --> 01:12:50,733
I have an odd feeling,
that he won't.

1081
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,600
Ah man, Pineapple.

1082
01:13:02,467 --> 01:13:06,033
I think tha's, Harrys phone

1083
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,233
Sure look, it's not me any way.

1084
01:13:30,033 --> 01:13:30,600
I's not him any way.

1085
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:37,367
Will I answer it?

1086
01:13:40,067 --> 01:13:40,600
What have we got left to lose?

1087
01:13:46,967 --> 01:13:49,667
Hello?

1088
01:13:49,667 --> 01:13:51,400
I see that you got away just in the nick of time,
Mr. Clancy?

1089
01:13:52,033 --> 01:13:52,633
Mmm-Hmmm.

1090
01:13:55,867 --> 01:13:57,767
How many more people have to
die, before I get my key back?

1091
01:13:59,133 --> 01:14:00,567
You, your friends

1092
01:14:02,033 --> 01:14:02,633
or perhaps your family?

1093
01:14:04,667 --> 01:14:05,733
Hoi, do't you fucking
threaten my family, you cunt.

1094
01:14:07,367 --> 01:14:10,767
Ah, this is't Harry. Is it?

1095
01:14:10,767 --> 01:14:12,567
No. No it's not.

1096
01:14:15,633 --> 01:14:18,600
H's a bit, tied
up at the moment.

1097
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:21,467
So yo're talking to me!

1098
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,567
Do you know what Harry
has actually done?

1099
01:14:26,533 --> 01:14:28,333
Pissed off a load of fucking
maniacs by the looks of it

1100
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:30,567
He has something
belonging to me.

1101
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,233
- Something very important.
- What? The Key?

1102
01:14:37,733 --> 01:14:39,467
- Yeah, we got the cliff notes version.
- It is of no use to you

1103
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,467
Maybe

1104
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:48,067
but I have about 800
friends on Facebook

1105
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:50,733
and about half of them
are drug dealers

1106
01:14:53,633 --> 01:14:56,033
and I'm fucking certain the'd
love to get the main supplier.

1107
01:14:57,067 --> 01:14:57,333
You know what I'm saying?

1108
01:14:59,733 --> 01:15:01,467
What is your name, Boy?

1109
01:15:02,767 --> 01:15:05,600
Benson Yau and I'm
no fucking boy.

1110
01:15:07,067 --> 01:15:07,733
What is it you want Mr. Yau?

1111
01:15:09,967 --> 01:15:14,033
Being honest,
I just want a shot at the cunt who put us in this mess.

1112
01:15:16,167 --> 01:15:18,533
Ya know? I do't even
have to beat you

1113
01:15:21,167 --> 01:15:25,333
I just want one, clean,
solid shot at your big thick skull, you cunt.

1114
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:26,700
You have my attention

1115
01:15:28,167 --> 01:15:29,233
I'm gonna send
you a location.

1116
01:15:31,433 --> 01:15:32,233
You're gonna meet me
there at dawn Alone

1117
01:15:34,533 --> 01:15:35,767
- OK?
- If you do't show,

1118
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,600
I will scorch the fucking
earth to find you

1119
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,000
and everyone yo've ever loved

1120
01:15:43,267 --> 01:15:44,067
and personally dismember them.

1121
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:46,600
Bye for now.

1122
01:15:50,967 --> 01:15:54,233
I'm guessing that was our buddy.

1123
01:15:56,233 --> 01:15:58,267
This
Man in Black

1124
01:16:02,033 --> 01:16:05,133
Yeah and I think I just signed
my own fucking death warrant.

1125
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,233
As much as I hate to say it,

1126
01:16:13,867 --> 01:16:15,400
but I think we gotta do right by

1127
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:17,500
that dead prick.

1128
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,133
His daughter

1129
01:16:23,967 --> 01:16:25,433
She has no part in any of this.

1130
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:40,033
What are we gonna do?

1131
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:48,633
Amigo,

1132
01:17:03,767 --> 01:17:04,167
I's all good bro

1133
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:09,333
I've got an idea-

1134
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,067
- Jay. Jay. Jay! Come on man.
Don't fucking leave me here.

1135
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,500
Hoi, wake up.
Come on, Jay.

1136
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,467
JAY!

1137
01:17:34,433 --> 01:17:35,367
Nothing like a good chinese,
boy. Fucking full as fuck.

1138
01:17:41,467 --> 01:17:42,200
Did ye hear from the boys lads?

1139
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,667
Sure how the hell would I know Francie.
Yo'd know before I would.

1140
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:48,667
Shut the fuck up and
get back to work.

1141
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:17,500
- What the fuck is this, hoi?
- Sure how the fuck do I know, Francie?

1142
01:18:23,533 --> 01:18:24,200
Harty

1143
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:33,300
Call the fucking boys.

1144
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:36,667
Hunts back on.

1145
01:18:38,467 --> 01:18:39,467
I do love me a hunt, Francie.

1146
01:18:43,267 --> 01:18:44,000
I need you to stay behind Mikey.

1147
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,767
I get you boss. Call for Backup?

1148
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:50,433
No, cause you're a fucking ham.

1149
01:18:55,933 --> 01:18:58,133
Don't forget the blonde bitch down by the boats,
you fucking precum.

1150
01:18:59,833 --> 01:19:00,533
Don't talk about my
beoure like that

1151
01:19:14,533 --> 01:19:18,333
Alright, 'm here.
Are we doing this?

1152
01:19:20,567 --> 01:19:21,033
You're the bulb off
your au' fella.

1153
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,067
I would't know.
He left before I could care.

1154
01:19:29,133 --> 01:19:29,533
Now let me get this straight

1155
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,267
This guy Banger, fucks
you over for a key

1156
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:37,767
Then my uncle, fucked him over

1157
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,433
and then he fucked over,
me and my best mate

1158
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:45,667
Who is now dead

1159
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:51,267
and I came here to get killed

1160
01:19:53,033 --> 01:19:53,700
Yeah.

1161
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,000
I tear apart anything
that gets in my way

1162
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,200
and eat them alive.

1163
01:20:12,467 --> 01:20:14,533
Look, man I do't fucking care.

1164
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,033
I've fucking. Killed people.

1165
01:20:19,033 --> 01:20:19,567
I'm not the same man

1166
01:20:21,133 --> 01:20:21,633
I just want this to be over.

1167
01:20:24,267 --> 01:20:27,933
- Bill. Bill Hart.
- What?

1168
01:20:27,933 --> 01:20:29,200
Tha's my name.

1169
01:20:31,667 --> 01:20:33,567
I thought you might like
to know before I kill you.

1170
01:20:33,567 --> 01:20:36,167
Look man, you have
your fucking key,

1171
01:20:36,167 --> 01:20:37,567
you have your drugs in the boot.

1172
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,267
All I want is my fucking
uncles daughter.

1173
01:20:42,133 --> 01:20:43,733
He does't have a daughter

1174
01:20:47,567 --> 01:20:50,533
Fucking cunt. H's fucking
with me even from the grave

1175
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:52,533
So what's it gonna be?

1176
01:20:53,967 --> 01:20:56,067
Quick or slow?

1177
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,567
So,

1178
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:01,700
tha's how i's gonna be is it?

1179
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:06,400
Alright.

1180
01:21:09,867 --> 01:21:12,567
Whoa. I should have known
it was gonna go down like this.

1181
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:13,433
You know yo're a lot more
like your father than you thi-

1182
01:21:19,733 --> 01:21:20,433
- You know what I
hate about this job.

1183
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:24,733
When you get to the top,
you don't get your hands dirty anymore.

1184
01:21:26,533 --> 01:21:27,200
So that's how it is, is it?

1185
01:21:28,533 --> 01:21:30,233
Just like that.
No bother man.

1186
01:21:32,067 --> 01:21:33,200
Just try and stay standing long
enough for me to enjoy it.

1187
01:21:34,033 --> 01:21:34,533
No bother, come on.

1188
01:21:48,467 --> 01:21:49,300
Fuck!

1189
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:02,400
Fuck you!

1190
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,600
I really thought yo'd make
it more difficult for me.

1191
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:11,567
To be honest, I'm a little
fucking disappointed.

1192
01:22:23,733 --> 01:22:26,700
Oh yo're good Benson.
Very good!

1193
01:22:32,267 --> 01:22:33,367
Fucking good enough to
kill Banger, aren't I?

1194
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:39,500
You say that as if it's
a fucking good thing.

1195
01:22:40,567 --> 01:22:41,600
H's fucking lucky you got him,

1196
01:22:43,433 --> 01:22:45,267
because I would've killed
that cunt slow and painful

1197
01:22:46,267 --> 01:22:47,433
for the misery he's caused me.

1198
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:52,433
You don't fucking get it do ya?
Huh?

1199
01:22:52,433 --> 01:22:53,467
Even if you fucking kill me,

1200
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:55,367
