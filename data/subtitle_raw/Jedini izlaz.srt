1
00:00:00,661 --> 00:00:04,651
Starring:

2
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:17,760
THE ONLY WAY OUT

3
00:00:57,584 --> 00:01:01,469
Directed by:

4
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:09,635
The movie was filmed in
Postojna Cave (Slovenia).

5
00:01:09,755 --> 00:01:13,504
During World War II, German occupying
forces used the cave to store

6
00:01:13,624 --> 00:01:16,671
nearly 1,000 barrels of
aircraft fuel, which were

7
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:20,613
destroyed in March 23, 1944
by Yugoslavian Partisans.

8
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:23,306
This story was losely
based on that event

9
00:01:23,426 --> 00:01:27,653
and any similarity with
real persons was accidental.

10
00:01:41,296 --> 00:01:43,726
For the first time,
we have to be careful

11
00:01:43,846 --> 00:01:46,227
about the object we
are about to demolish.

12
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:50,738
We have a strict order not to use
too much explosive in the Cave.

13
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:54,638
Because it is a wonder of nature.
-It would make a nice tomb for us.

14
00:01:54,758 --> 00:01:57,890
Seems that the fuel is stored
in some unimportant part.

15
00:01:58,106 --> 00:01:59,810
We are here.

16
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,079
The Germans have
walled up the passage.

17
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:05,031
That's why they don't guard it.

18
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:07,818
But there is an
underground river here.

19
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:11,943
Some parts, called siphons,
are completely submerged.

20
00:02:12,063 --> 00:02:16,584
The fuel storage is 4 miles away,
at the tourist entrance.

21
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,870
Do we know the quantity?
-Approximately 50 wagons.

22
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,686
Has anyone of you been in the Cave?

23
00:02:28,806 --> 00:02:32,155
I know only the entrance
near the railway.

24
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:37,916
Maybe we have to go through the
undercurrents. -Why through there?

25
00:02:38,982 --> 00:02:42,850
Better that we go through this
hallway. It is faster and safer.

26
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:46,269
Damn, this is a nasty action.

27
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,615
Four men in the dark
with new commander.

28
00:02:49,735 --> 00:02:51,617
We should think of men.

29
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:55,831
I've told you already that the passage
has been walled up. -We will break through.

30
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:59,586
No one has ever passed through
the undercurrents. -I know that.

31
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:04,720
I'm going to see the security officer.
We go as soon as I come back.

32
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,523
You shouldn't talk to
the commander like that.

33
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:32,935
I just don't know what came over me.
Let's forget about it.

34
00:03:37,912 --> 00:03:42,713
I was with Maria last night.
She asked me where I would go.

35
00:03:43,185 --> 00:03:47,425
I didn't want to tell her.
She told me: "Watch yourself!"

36
00:03:47,545 --> 00:03:51,222
Why would she tell me something
like that? -She loves you.

37
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:54,000
Have you ever loved someone?

38
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:59,602
Not as much as I should have.

39
00:04:08,887 --> 00:04:12,811
When you are with a woman,
you wish the war is over.

40
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:16,563
You know, her fingers are...

41
00:04:17,296 --> 00:04:20,474
...long, long as blades of grass.

42
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:28,709
I was a master shooter with marbles,
when I was a kid.

43
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:31,928
This one doesn't count.

44
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,922
Let's go over there to
smoke our cigarettes.

45
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:50,411
You go. I'll smoke here.

46
00:05:14,502 --> 00:05:17,278
So, white bread diet again?

47
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:19,772
I wish it is white.

48
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:24,939
We have a little time left,
let's smoke our cigarettes.

49
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:28,092
Let's wait for the commander.

50
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:32,504
Let's not!
Who knows what the new one is alike.

51
00:05:35,694 --> 00:05:38,350
And this I will stash away.

52
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:44,254
This way,
at least my tobacco would be dry.

53
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:46,722
Hand me the lighter.

54
00:05:50,824 --> 00:05:54,024
It is reliable, but almost empty.

55
00:05:58,587 --> 00:06:02,390
Down there, you have 50
wagons of fuel, you could use.

56
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:05,401
If we live in some other time,

57
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:09,598
now it would be a proper time
for a prayer and confession.

58
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:16,668
But, since we are, what we are,
let everyone thinks what he wants.

59
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:09,695
Look at Jozha. He still smokes.

60
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:16,275
It must be that you come up
with something. -Me?

61
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:19,554
This time - nothing.

62
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,415
I don't like this rain.
The undercurrent will raise up.

63
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,907
Rudy, you cigarette butt is the shortest
and my the longest. It means something.

64
00:08:37,027 --> 00:08:39,193
Means what?
-Nothing. I was joking.

65
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:42,346
Four butts - all grouped together.

66
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:51,477
Everything ready?

67
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,488
Yes, for now.

68
00:08:53,838 --> 00:08:56,750
Our mission is crystal clear:
the fuel must fly sky-high,

69
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,573
or our asses are on the line.
Stay together.

70
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:02,739
If someone gets lost...
-...let him yells: "Ooya!"

71
00:09:04,386 --> 00:09:06,541
Be careful and agile.

72
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:10,328
We must go through water.
Have you protected the explosive?

73
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:14,517
Silly me! You have been in many
similar missions, haven't you?

74
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,527
Depends. Most of us have
been in more than 30 missions.

75
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:22,411
And you, comrade commander?

76
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:30,299
OK, let's smoke a cigarette now.

77
00:09:36,505 --> 00:09:40,706
We have done that already,
comrade commander.

78
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,039
Is that so?

79
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,044
Now he knows about our cigarettes.
-Ah...

80
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:01,709
Good start!

81
00:10:56,771 --> 00:10:59,421
Keep the necessary distance.

82
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:01,465
Jozha...

83
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:06,056
Come out, comrades!
I played this for you.

84
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:14,575
Are you insane?!
Acting like a fool!

85
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:20,611
I just wanted to check
electric installations.

86
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:23,302
Don't be afraid.
They cannot hear us.

87
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:26,792
The fuel storage is a
couple of miles from here.

88
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:30,598
So, this means that the Germans
can turn on the lights in the Cave.

89
00:14:30,718 --> 00:14:33,051
No, not the entire cave at once.

90
00:14:33,688 --> 00:14:37,860
This switch, turns the lights
on, 200 yards behind us,

91
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,044
and this one,
200 yards in front of us.

92
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:44,920
The tourist bureau was thrifty, taking
care about economical use of lights.

93
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,614
You mustn't do it again without
my approval. Understand?

94
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:50,915
Yes, comrade commander.

95
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:18,279
They built a strong wall,
as we predicted.

96
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,936
Let's try to break through.

97
00:15:21,056 --> 00:15:23,755
Shorty, let's start!
-Wait!

98
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,103
Impossible. A concrete wall.

99
00:15:30,311 --> 00:15:33,352
Who knows what's behind it.
And they could hear us.

100
00:15:33,978 --> 00:15:37,069
Explosion could crumble the hallway.

101
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:40,317
Going through the underground
river would be insane.

102
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:44,926
It has been raining for days.
The water level must be high.

103
00:15:45,046 --> 00:15:47,171
Make a decision.

104
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:53,372
I was told that there was one siphon
through which we might be able to pass.

105
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:55,630
It's our only chance.

106
00:15:56,257 --> 00:15:58,072
Let's go.

107
00:16:03,475 --> 00:16:06,963
This newbie doesn't
want to hit the wall...

108
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,813
...with his head.

109
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:11,563
Let's go.

110
00:16:51,383 --> 00:16:55,451
Take care about the explosive
and protect your flashlights.

111
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:28,901
Jozha and me, we are going ahead.
You three wait here.

112
00:18:29,338 --> 00:18:32,596
When you hear my whistle,
you come along.

113
00:18:36,677 --> 00:18:41,040
Wait here! Commander and
Jozha have gone to see around.

114
00:18:44,218 --> 00:18:46,739
Give me the matches.

115
00:18:58,582 --> 00:19:01,219
I don't have it.

116
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,643
I don't know where I put it.

117
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:40,514
Wait! The water is rising.

118
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:42,584
It has risen a lot.

119
00:19:43,093 --> 00:19:46,774
We shouldn't go any
further or we would drown.

120
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,400
Stop talking! Hurry up!

121
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:54,066
How would we go back?

122
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:04,647
The same way.

123
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:09,033
Only faster.
The Germans will chase us.

124
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:41,713
Come on, Rudy!
-Don't you see the water level?

125
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:46,435
We have a new commander.
What is he going to think about us?!

126
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:13,738
And now what?

127
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:18,312
And if that is 50 yards long?

128
00:21:18,432 --> 00:21:22,294
You're insane! I won't go!
I won't commit a suicide!

129
00:21:26,436 --> 00:21:29,062
Who doesn't dare, just go back.

130
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:48,797
Be my guest.

131
00:23:28,064 --> 00:23:31,371
We've slipped through.

132
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:34,285
The shore is near.

133
00:24:05,932 --> 00:24:08,140
Good work, comrades.

134
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:15,477
We've managed to get here
for less than a half of hour.

135
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:19,474
I doubt that we would be able to
penetrate the wall in that time.

136
00:24:19,594 --> 00:24:21,572
Jozha?
-Huh?

137
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:25,622
What about the explosive?
- Everything is in order.

138
00:24:27,988 --> 00:24:33,476
Tomo? -The same.
Even the cigarettes are dry.

139
00:24:40,714 --> 00:24:46,679
We can smoke a cigrette now.
-I would prefer a snack.

140
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:22,061
Here, Rudy... Have a smoke.

141
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:06,535
If you have finished your
cigarettes, we can move on.

142
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:43,824
Should I go ahead with a flashlight?

143
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:47,133
I would choose this way.
-I don't think so.

144
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,835
I don't see anything on this chart.

145
00:27:51,385 --> 00:27:54,133
But I do not agree with you.
-Comrade commander...

146
00:27:54,253 --> 00:27:57,550
This passage is narrow and
has a dead end, I'm sure.

147
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:02,522
I think we should go that way. The
Germans has probably walled up this one.

148
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:06,383
Germans did not built another wall.
No discussion any more!

149
00:28:06,803 --> 00:28:09,867
Follow me. We don't have much time.

150
00:28:16,022 --> 00:28:18,260
Hollow and rings like a bell.

151
00:28:31,696 --> 00:28:35,940
He pretends to be a wise guy, huh?
-He is sure that he knows.

152
00:28:57,143 --> 00:29:01,718
You're gonna spent your flashlight,
comrade commander.

153
00:29:09,377 --> 00:29:11,624
We will try your way.

154
00:29:11,944 --> 00:29:16,531
We are wasting our time. We should
have broken through that wall.

155
00:29:16,651 --> 00:29:18,680
What are you trying to say?
-Nothing.

156
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,697
Then stop talking!

157
00:29:21,096 --> 00:29:25,082
If you have soiled your pants, don't go!
-I shouldn't have come!

158
00:29:25,202 --> 00:29:27,204
Enough! Go back!

159
00:29:37,201 --> 00:29:39,898
He's gonna destroy us, for sure.

160
00:29:40,018 --> 00:29:42,037
Turn off that lamp.

161
00:29:43,086 --> 00:29:46,507
Why are you looking at me?!
Let me be.

162
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,657
Turn off the light.

163
00:30:35,693 --> 00:30:37,084
Jozha.

164
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:42,958
Jozha!
-Huh?

165
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:46,055
What is this?
-I don't know.

166
00:30:46,175 --> 00:30:49,216
Probably some lights
from one of the halls.

167
00:30:49,336 --> 00:30:51,925
We are still far away
from the entrance.

168
00:30:52,045 --> 00:30:54,683
This is probably "Concert Hall".

169
00:30:58,784 --> 00:31:03,575
Rudy and Shorty stay with the gear.
The rest of you, follow me.

170
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:44,655
Shorty...

171
00:31:45,956 --> 00:31:47,730
Listen, Shorty...

172
00:31:49,534 --> 00:31:53,630
"Turn off the lamp.
What are you looking at!"

173
00:31:54,382 --> 00:31:56,991
Now we have turned off everything.

174
00:31:57,211 --> 00:31:59,754
Tell the Krauts to turn off, as well.

175
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,324
There are 3-4 guards.

176
00:32:51,544 --> 00:32:53,407
They have a kitchen there.

177
00:32:53,527 --> 00:32:56,837
They have a radio, as well.

178
00:32:57,704 --> 00:33:00,174
What could that be?

179
00:33:00,294 --> 00:33:03,541
Some sort of a guard exchange post.

180
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,188
Maybe that is the storage.

181
00:33:06,308 --> 00:33:09,849
Impossible. The storage is
much deeper, behind the bridge.

182
00:33:09,969 --> 00:33:11,917
Let's eliminate them.

183
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:13,691
Eh, Tomo...

184
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:18,745
Three Krauts doesn't
worth 50 wagons of fuel.

185
00:33:19,745 --> 00:33:22,992
Go back and bring
those two and the gear.

186
00:33:34,058 --> 00:33:37,877
Shorty, forgive me, please.

187
00:33:40,124 --> 00:33:42,696
I don't give a damn.

188
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:55,580
Forget it.

189
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:59,816
I'm dreaming.

190
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:06,022
I see a bright sunshine of Africa.
-Why are you talking about sunshine?

191
00:34:06,142 --> 00:34:07,973
No reason.

192
00:34:09,158 --> 00:34:11,718
Just wanted to tell something.

193
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:15,056
I'm sick of all these rocks.

194
00:34:15,376 --> 00:34:18,592
I wish I could see a daylight,
just once more.

195
00:34:18,712 --> 00:34:20,556
Don't worry.

196
00:34:21,665 --> 00:34:23,732
You'll see it.

197
00:34:27,304 --> 00:34:30,689
A man could be afraid
of some weired things.

198
00:34:31,885 --> 00:34:34,302
Could be, but mustn't be.

199
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:39,454
C'mon, the commander is calling.

200
00:34:42,545 --> 00:34:46,107
According to this chart,
we should go through this hall.

201
00:34:46,227 --> 00:34:48,378
Yes, this is "Concert Hall".

202
00:34:48,498 --> 00:34:51,826
It's a shorter way.
Now we have to take a longer detour.

203
00:34:51,946 --> 00:34:54,460
We just have to reach the railway.

204
00:34:55,058 --> 00:34:58,573
I recognize this part of the cave.

205
00:34:58,693 --> 00:35:00,003
Can you...

206
00:35:00,423 --> 00:35:04,142
Can you find the detour?
-Yes, I can.

207
00:35:04,462 --> 00:35:07,243
We have to cross over a hill.

208
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:10,539
I think they call it... uhm...

209
00:35:10,659 --> 00:35:12,915
They call it...

210
00:35:13,035 --> 00:35:15,512
Calvary, or something like that.

211
00:35:16,611 --> 00:35:20,166
We move. Absolute silence.

212
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:28,444
And now the Calvary!

213
00:35:28,564 --> 00:35:31,848
In the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

214
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,884
Oh, Jesus Christ,
your torment is upon us now.

215
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:46,682
Little fish...

216
00:35:46,802 --> 00:35:48,298
Little fish.

217
00:35:48,418 --> 00:35:51,687
Nice little olm.

218
00:35:51,807 --> 00:35:55,370
What a nice little olm.

219
00:36:01,236 --> 00:36:06,366
Don't be afraid. Come here now.

220
00:36:06,923 --> 00:36:10,437
Are you a fish... or a man?

221
00:36:10,557 --> 00:36:13,984
Little fish. Little fish.

222
00:36:25,228 --> 00:36:28,140
Why are they shooting?
-Maybe they saw us.

223
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:32,089
Impossible. They would light up
the cave and sound the alarm.

224
00:36:44,315 --> 00:36:46,589
Forget it. Move on.

225
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:57,021
Come and get it!

226
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:17,427
(Speaking German)

227
00:37:24,136 --> 00:37:31,326
(Speaking German)

228
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:37,055
(Radio warning)

229
00:37:37,175 --> 00:37:43,899
(Speaking German)

230
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:52,843
(Speaking German)

231
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:56,727
(Speaking German)

232
00:37:57,892 --> 00:37:59,695
(Speaking German)

233
00:38:00,297 --> 00:38:02,079
(Speaking German)

234
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,211
(Speaking German)

235
00:38:15,304 --> 00:38:18,522
(Speaking German)

236
00:38:18,742 --> 00:38:21,742
(Speaking German)

237
00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:32,546
Hey!

238
00:38:33,154 --> 00:38:35,444
Put out the cigarette, now!

239
00:38:43,396 --> 00:38:45,796
Calvary.

240
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,427
Shorty...

241
00:38:55,665 --> 00:38:57,444
I've decided.

242
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:00,921
I can not stand this
uncertainty any more.

243
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:05,866
As soon as we reach the target,
I will go into action. -Why you?

244
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,745
The commander will choose.
-He must choose me!

245
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:13,493
You mean, because of this.

246
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:17,074
What's he saying?
-Nothing.

247
00:39:17,194 --> 00:39:20,847
Give him the lighter.
He doesn't have any matches left.

248
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:23,134
This one is not for everybody.

249
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,284
I'm gonna steal it, for sure.

250
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:29,491
After the war,
I will make a lighter like this.

251
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:34,617
Yeah, just go ahead.

252
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:39,271
I'll keep this one, for now.

253
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,550
Pay attention now!

254
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,412
What is it, Jozha?

255
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:50,309
I've found the detour.
And the railway is close by.

256
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,020
One route leads back to the bridge,

257
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,657
and the other,
straight to the entrance.

258
00:39:59,633 --> 00:40:02,802
This has been like a
tourist walk, so far.

259
00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:04,805
Now it's over with tourism.

260
00:40:04,925 --> 00:40:07,526
Keep quite and alert.

261
00:40:46,317 --> 00:40:49,725
(Speaking German)

262
00:41:20,404 --> 00:41:22,530
So, here you are, birdies!

263
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,944
And now the showtime.

264
00:41:32,168 --> 00:41:34,866
What a beast's lair!

265
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:36,996
It's OK, comrades.

266
00:41:37,335 --> 00:41:41,015
We predicted something like this.

267
00:41:41,612 --> 00:41:46,050
It is the entrance, so there will be
no significant damage if we blow it up.

268
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,866
This will make a nice little fire.
-Keep quite and get to work.

269
00:41:49,986 --> 00:41:53,727
Jozha, keep watching the guards.
-Yes, commander.

270
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:58,091
Shorty, you will go and...
-...and me.

271
00:42:01,657 --> 00:42:03,271
All right.

272
00:42:04,207 --> 00:42:06,631
Tomo and Jozha will cover us.

273
00:42:06,951 --> 00:42:11,508
In the case of a fight, we shall not
retreat until Shorty and Rudy return.

274
00:42:11,628 --> 00:42:13,827
I'll fix it to explode
in a half of an hour.

275
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:15,609
Half an hour?

276
00:42:16,304 --> 00:42:18,671
No. Two hours.

277
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:21,495
We need that much to escape.

278
00:42:23,654 --> 00:42:26,568
I'm going to have a closer look.

279
00:42:26,914 --> 00:42:31,275
A bit too cautious, our new pal.
He could say two days.

280
00:42:31,695 --> 00:42:35,083
Who knows. Maybe he's right.

281
00:42:39,142 --> 00:42:41,738
Yeah, why not...

282
00:42:42,629 --> 00:42:45,743
I'm so tense, I could explode myself.

283
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,427
Stop whining!

284
00:42:47,647 --> 00:42:50,855
If you had a britches,
you would have soiled yourself.

285
00:42:50,965 --> 00:42:54,330
Not that one!
Use a chemical fuse, you bungler!

286
00:42:59,737 --> 00:43:02,431
You always think only
how to fill your belly.

287
00:43:03,385 --> 00:43:06,698
You're lucky to be with us,
so no one would know.

288
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:09,960
No, not that one.
Use the other one, instead.

289
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:21,350
Their garrison is full of soldiers.
I don't know about this side.

290
00:43:21,502 --> 00:43:25,414
Don't worry. When they reach
the cave, we will be far away.

291
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:29,107
Are you planning to stay?
Taking your boot like that.

292
00:43:29,227 --> 00:43:31,878
I wouldn't do that.
-Something pinched me.

293
00:43:31,998 --> 00:43:34,123
Don't do that, bro.

294
00:43:35,236 --> 00:43:39,372
They could smell your stinking feet.
-Quite!

295
00:43:42,484 --> 00:43:46,374
If they spot me,
you should eliminate the guards.

296
00:43:47,913 --> 00:43:49,929
Don't worry, Rudy.

297
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:58,113
Light me.

298
00:44:01,521 --> 00:44:02,977
Hey, gimme that!

299
00:44:03,097 --> 00:44:06,193
Later. Now I know that
you will cover us properly.

300
00:44:06,313 --> 00:44:08,906
Here. Take this to comfort you.

301
00:44:12,122 --> 00:44:14,399
Well... Ready?

302
00:44:14,878 --> 00:44:16,434
We're ready.

303
00:44:16,995 --> 00:44:18,444
Let's go!

304
00:44:19,717 --> 00:44:23,463
Stay hidden and don't turn any light.

305
00:44:23,683 --> 00:44:28,168
Yeah, now I wish to be a bat.

306
00:45:38,587 --> 00:45:40,583
It is mined!

307
00:46:22,688 --> 00:46:25,850
If they spot them,
shoot in the searchlight.

308
00:46:31,972 --> 00:46:37,649
(Speaking German)

309
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:43,480
(Speaking German)

310
00:47:05,784 --> 00:47:10,125
See, it's only a cat.
-Yeah and we almost open fire.

311
00:47:11,607 --> 00:47:14,835
Come, kitty, kitty...

312
00:47:16,498 --> 00:47:19,624
If they spot me, I'll start to meow.

313
00:47:29,497 --> 00:47:32,410
Come to me, kitty.

314
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:37,085
(Speaking German)

315
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:46,761
(Speaking German)

316
00:49:16,041 --> 00:49:17,925
Someone is there!

317
00:49:23,882 --> 00:49:26,530
We can forget the explosive now.
They will find it.

318
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:29,364
I'll light up the fuel.
Give me the lighter. -I'll do it.

319
00:49:29,431 --> 00:49:32,984
Give it to me! -We'll go together.
-Go back!

320
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:35,140
Cover me!

321
00:49:49,272 --> 00:49:53,152
Rudy will light up the fuel.
We have to wait for him.

322
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,948
Rudy!

323
00:50:51,546 --> 00:50:54,602
It's burning!

324
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,604
(Krauts yelling)

325
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:03,890
Rudy! Over here! Rudy!

326
00:52:19,648 --> 00:52:22,740
Here! Take this, Krauts!

327
00:52:26,361 --> 00:52:28,228
Rudy!

328
00:52:40,087 --> 00:52:42,276
Rudy! Shorty!

329
00:52:47,257 --> 00:52:48,607
Shorty!

330
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,998
Rudy! Where are you?

331
00:52:53,318 --> 00:52:54,656
Rudy!

332
00:52:55,448 --> 00:52:58,046
We must go back!

333
00:53:16,065 --> 00:53:19,419
Try to awake him.
The Krauts could be here any second.

334
00:53:19,842 --> 00:53:22,871
Is he wounded?
-I didn't see any wound.

335
00:53:23,091 --> 00:53:25,149
Probably just a concussion.

336
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:30,284
Strange that they haven't turn on the
lights. Maybe damaged in the explosion.

337
00:53:31,387 --> 00:53:32,907
What about him?

338
00:53:33,596 --> 00:53:35,193
Nothing yet.

339
00:53:35,419 --> 00:53:40,449
I hope that they would not cut us off.
-The flame has blocked the way for Krauts.

340
00:53:40,569 --> 00:53:43,097
Nevertheless, we don't have much time.

341
00:53:47,905 --> 00:53:50,458
What's going on? Where are we?

342
00:53:51,844 --> 00:53:54,391
Shorty! Shorty!

343
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:02,800
Rudy!

344
00:54:08,235 --> 00:54:10,771
Oh, it's you. Where is Rudy?

345
00:54:10,891 --> 00:54:13,048
Shorty, can you stand up?

346
00:54:13,168 --> 00:54:15,226
Are you wounded?
-I don't know.

347
00:54:15,346 --> 00:54:18,455
What about Rudy?
-In such a flame, even stones burn.

348
00:54:18,575 --> 00:54:21,505
What? You left Rudy behind?
-You called him. Did he answer?

349
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,721
I didn't see him fall.
-What do you think?

350
00:54:23,841 --> 00:54:28,062
I thought I saw him running. And
then it exploded, and I passed out.

351
00:54:29,904 --> 00:54:31,181
Listen, Shorty...

352
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:34,921
Give me a straight answer:
Are you sure that he is alive?

353
00:54:35,896 --> 00:54:39,439
Maybe he crawled under
those moist rocks there.

354
00:54:39,864 --> 00:54:44,031
We cannot hesitate any more.
We completed the mission.

355
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:47,937
Who did complete it?
He did complete the mission!

356
00:54:48,057 --> 00:54:50,844
What could we do?
-Let's try to find him!

357
00:54:50,964 --> 00:54:52,585
Wait!

358
00:54:53,616 --> 00:54:55,310
Krauts!

359
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:03,663
Go back!

360
00:55:06,626 --> 00:55:08,024
Here.

361
00:55:08,244 --> 00:55:11,053
Get moving. Go!

362
00:56:02,356 --> 00:56:05,723
(Speaking German)

363
00:56:32,033 --> 00:56:33,432
Wait!

364
00:56:42,851 --> 00:56:46,151
They go back.
-It's Rudy!

365
00:56:46,371 --> 00:56:47,965
What are you trying to say?

366
00:56:48,085 --> 00:56:49,909
He's alive!
-How do you know that?

367
00:56:50,129 --> 00:56:52,816
You don't know that.
-How do you know that?

368
00:56:52,936 --> 00:56:54,502
Take it easy.

369
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:59,302
We don't know why are they
going back. -It is clear why.

370
00:56:59,785 --> 00:57:02,472
Only five of us entered the cave.

371
00:57:02,592 --> 00:57:05,509
Dogs can smell live and dead people.

372
00:57:07,058 --> 00:57:08,761
So, this is how you think.

373
00:57:08,881 --> 00:57:11,954
If the Germans don't start
to shoot, then... -Then what!

374
00:57:12,113 --> 00:57:14,881
To sit here and wait?
-Yes, damn it!

375
00:57:15,001 --> 00:57:18,349
Or would you rather
take us to attack them?

376
00:57:19,484 --> 00:57:21,716
We did everything we could.

377
00:57:21,836 --> 00:57:24,444
What sort of a man are you?

378
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,529
I haven't heard a single shot.

379
00:58:32,649 --> 00:58:36,962
Would it be better if you did?
Maybe they have captured him.

380
00:58:38,411 --> 00:58:41,187
Rudy would never surrender.

381
00:58:41,307 --> 00:58:45,209
What if he was unconscious, like me?

382
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:48,934
We couldn't do anything about it.
-Why not?

383
00:58:49,054 --> 00:58:52,937
We were sitting here like some
old ladies. -I'm going alone! -Stop!

384
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:58,672
Stop right there! What makes you think
that you are better than the rest of us.

385
00:58:58,792 --> 00:59:04,097
We've been in trouble many times
before and we never left a man behind.

386
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:06,047
Enough!

387
00:59:06,377 --> 00:59:08,628
They are going to the bridge.

388
00:59:20,198 --> 00:59:24,243
Why did they return to the storage?
-Why did they come here in the first place?

389
00:59:24,363 --> 00:59:26,335
I don't know.
-I do.

390
00:59:26,455 --> 00:59:28,036
Listen.

391
00:59:33,121 --> 00:59:38,634
My orders were to complete the mission and
to save the men. And you want to ruin us!

392
00:59:38,754 --> 00:59:41,708
Retreat! That's an order!

393
00:59:41,928 --> 00:59:45,726
Hurry up! Or they would cut us off.

394
01:00:05,843 --> 01:00:08,374
They are coming. Fire!

395
01:00:18,682 --> 01:00:21,635
Go cross over the bridge. Hurry!

396
01:00:25,445 --> 01:00:28,379
Comrades! This is my fault.

397
01:00:29,035 --> 01:00:33,187
Go, cross the bridge.
I will cover you.

398
01:00:50,656 --> 01:00:54,928
Go now!
I'll shoot better if I'm alone.

399
01:01:06,139 --> 01:01:08,534
Go after him.

400
01:01:10,217 --> 01:01:11,989
I order you to go!

401
01:01:12,109 --> 01:01:14,412
This is my fault. I'll cover you.

402
01:01:15,499 --> 01:01:19,017
I give the orders around here!
-But, commander...

403
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,513
Go, when I'm telling you.

404
01:01:21,633 --> 01:01:24,920
Soon, it would be too
late for both of us.

405
01:01:49,226 --> 01:01:53,415
This one is for Rudy!
Fuck you!

406
01:02:16,788 --> 01:02:18,294
Shorty!

407
01:02:18,414 --> 01:02:20,739
Watch yourself, Shorty!

408
01:03:07,715 --> 01:03:09,518
Comrades...

409
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,884
I'm only holding you...
-Don't talk, Shorty.

410
01:03:14,104 --> 01:03:17,122
Throw some grenades.
Keep them there.

411
01:03:20,951 --> 01:03:23,159
This was all my fault.

412
01:03:23,629 --> 01:03:25,506
Don't talk now.

413
01:04:37,212 --> 01:04:40,291
Lucky for us, the
siphon is not too long.

414
01:04:54,734 --> 01:04:57,442
Maybe they are still
here in the dark.

415
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:01,698
Sergeant!

416
01:05:05,545 --> 01:05:10,676
Collect this as an evidence.
-Yes, sergeant.

417
01:06:36,178 --> 01:06:38,727
Comrades!

418
01:07:50,271 --> 01:07:52,572
Comrades!

419
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:28,315
Comrades!

420
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:34,992
The dawn is near.

421
01:08:41,612 --> 01:08:43,535
The sky is clear.

422
01:08:45,128 --> 01:08:48,628
This will be a beautiful day.

423
01:08:53,043 --> 01:08:55,161
Yes, it's a daybreak.

424
01:08:55,732 --> 01:08:57,687
Any moment now.

425
01:08:59,599 --> 01:09:02,861
Go and bring a stretcher.

426
01:09:12,555 --> 01:09:14,110
I regret...

427
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:19,230
I've kept Tomo's lighter
and I wouldn't be able...

428
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:22,593
...to return it to him.

429
01:09:22,713 --> 01:09:26,524
We'll put you on a stretcher.
You will feel better.

430
01:09:28,657 --> 01:09:30,519
Stars...

431
01:09:31,946 --> 01:09:34,197
Like marbles...

432
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:41,466
It is not good to remember...

433
01:09:47,569 --> 01:09:49,756
Forgive me...

434
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:55,403
I was rude with you.

435
01:09:58,364 --> 01:10:00,500
Well, you know...

436
01:10:02,979 --> 01:10:05,421
New commander...

437
01:10:05,961 --> 01:10:09,968
I understand. Don't talk now.
You need to rest.

438
01:10:10,088 --> 01:10:11,910
It was my fault.

439
01:10:12,796 --> 01:10:16,261
I put you all in jeopardy.

440
01:10:16,381 --> 01:10:18,055
Forget it.

441
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:22,687
Don't talk about it.

442
01:10:23,833 --> 01:10:26,655
Who knows who's fault was that.

443
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:30,241
Don't be angry with me...

444
01:10:30,561 --> 01:10:35,424
...but I still think
that Rudy is alive.

445
01:10:41,893 --> 01:10:47,242
I would like to smoke
a cigarette with you...

446
01:10:47,362 --> 01:10:49,643
Shorty. Shorty.

447
01:10:50,567 --> 01:10:52,124
Shorty!

448
01:10:53,877 --> 01:10:55,607
Shorty!

449
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:00,864
Shorty!

450
01:12:20,214 --> 01:12:22,951
Take him down to the checkpoint.

451
01:12:41,613 --> 01:12:45,520
Leave the gun. I'll follow you.

452
01:12:46,355 --> 01:12:47,968
Tomo...

453
01:12:51,846 --> 01:12:55,198
He asked me to give you this lighter.

454
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:01,696
Thank you, comrade commander.

455
01:14:55,194 --> 01:14:57,073
Rudy!

456
01:18:16,295 --> 01:18:18,283
Rudy, it's me.

457
01:18:18,503 --> 01:18:22,779
Hurry! They are going to the wall.
We will go through the understreams.

458
01:18:28,398 --> 01:18:29,629
Finally!

459
01:18:31,371 --> 01:18:34,395
Let me go first, this time.

460
01:18:57,255 --> 01:19:00,438
What about the others?
-All out and safe.

461
01:19:06,225 --> 01:19:08,055
I wonder...

462
01:19:10,927 --> 01:19:12,946
What is it, Rudy?

463
01:19:13,446 --> 01:19:16,415
You wanted to ask me something.

464
01:19:20,479 --> 01:19:23,926
I wonder why Shorty isn't with you.

465
01:19:25,053 --> 01:19:27,928
He couldn't come.

466
01:19:30,445 --> 01:19:33,210
Is he badly wounded?

467
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:37,458
We carried him.
He didn't suffer for long.

468
01:19:42,505 --> 01:19:46,885
It was during the night and he said:
"It will be a beautiful day."
