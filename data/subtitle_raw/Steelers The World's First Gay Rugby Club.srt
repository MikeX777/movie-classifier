00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,400
I need you to dig fucking deep

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Official YIFY movies site:
YTS.MX

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,360
and bring me everything you've got

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,560
because every single point will

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,560
matter in this game.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's get this fucking one in the

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
first half. Let's put some points on

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,480
in the second half. Big effort
please gentlemen.

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
Big effort.

11
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,720
Steelers on three.

12
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,440
3, 2, 1. Steelers!

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,640
SIMON: Rugby is a really
welcoming sport.

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,760
It's just that those of us

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,960
who are gay

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,240
we're still like, we just
peering out the door

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,080
We're like, are you sure it's safe
to come out?

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,360
Are you sure?

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,960
NIC: We pigeonhole people and we

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,960
keep on, you know, perpetuating

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,920
those cycles of male
hegemony that says

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,240
that we have to be heterosexual.

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,120
We have to act in this way.

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,400
This is what a sportsman looks like.

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,280
And actually, no.

26
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,440
This is not what a
sportsman looks like.

27
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,560
DREW: There's this element of
being a rugby player

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,440
even as a gay rugby player

29
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,600
that there's a certain
masculinity that you need

30
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,160
to maintain.

31
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,080
To me, that's bollocks.

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,120
You know, I will be tough and brutal

33
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,240
and kick your arse on the pitch.

34
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,440
When I'm off the pitch

35
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,240
I will be as flagrant

36
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,120
and as flamboyant as I want.

37
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,040
EAMMON: This is me.

38
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,320
Twelve years old.

39
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,360
Joining my first rugby
club in Australia.

40
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,960
And this is me now.

41
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,040
I'm a reporter and a cameraman

42
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,440
so I'm used to telling stories

43
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,800
but I've never told one

44
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,480
this personal.

45
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,400
For me, this isn't just a story

46
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,840
about being gay.

47
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,720
It's not even a story about playing

48
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
rugby.

49
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,520
It's a story about struggle,

50
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,960
acceptance

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,800
searching for happiness

52
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,480
and finding a place to belong.

53
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,000
Around the time this
photo was taken

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,320
I guess I started to realise
that I was gay

55
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,720
and for me, it was a struggle.

56
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,960
It was also the same time that the

57
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,960
kids at school figured it out.

58
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,520
Poofta, faggot, fudge packer.

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,640
These were the names I was
pretty much called

60
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,840
on a daily basis.

61
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,440
The bullying was unrelenting.

62
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,960
That was 20 years ago now, but I can

63
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,920
still remember the shame

64
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,760
that I carried on my shoulders.

65
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,560
The fear and the anxiety

66
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,720
that my family would find out.

67
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,440
In fact, this rugby club was the only

68
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,280
place where I wasn't getting bullied.

69
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,960
Here I wasn't the gay kid.

70
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,760
Here, I was the total second-rower

71
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,920
who was good at scoring tries.

72
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,560
It was the mid 90s.

73
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,720
Around that very same time something

74
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,920
was happening on the other side of

75
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,600
the world in London that would

76
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,160
drastically change my life

77
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,160
and the lives of thousands of others.

78
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,280
A group of friends were
having a drink in a pub

79
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,920
in London's King's Cross

80
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,600
and they came up with what was

81
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,840
at the time a radical idea

82
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,640
to start the world's first

83
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,040
gay rugby club.

84
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,520
And that's how the Kings Cross
Steelers was born.

85
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,080
MATT: You know, the Steelers were
the first gay rugby team

86
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,800
in the world.

87
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,920
We've been in this tournament
many times.

88
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,240
We've got as far as we have now

89
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,320
but we've never won it.

90
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,600
So to be part of the team that

91
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
is the first team from the Steelers

92
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,400
to win the Bingham Cup

93
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,520
would be incredible.

94
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,760
EAMMON: In their first season the

95
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,520
boys were trying to line up fixtures

96
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,840
against straight teams across England.

97
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,760
They sent out 130 invitations.

98
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,280
But would you believe
only 20 came back.

99
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,240
It was a different world back then.

100
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,720
As for straight rugby players, well,

101
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,800
they were worried about catching
HIV on the pitch.

102
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,600
But the boys didn't give up.

103
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,960
And without knowing it

104
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,960
they had started something big.

105
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,800
Flash forward two decades from
that single team

106
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,920
there are now 60 gay clubs around the world

107
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,480
and every two years they meet

108
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,760
for the Bingham Cup.

109
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,160
And this year it's in Amsterdam.

110
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,280
NIC: We can do this.

111
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,560
But if we do this

112
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,280
it'll be against all the odds.

113
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,640
EAMMON: It's the World Cup
of gay rugby

114
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,440
and over the next three days

115
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,360
that's where this story takes place.

116
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,320
NIC: Okay, so listen up.

117
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,040
A couple of things that I want us to

118
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,240
think about now

119
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,000
is that we really switched on and we're a squad.

120
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,080
EAMMON: And even though the Steelers
were the first gay rugby club

121
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,400
they've never won this tournament.

122
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,240
And these boys are their biggest
competition this week:

123
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,920
The Sydney Convicts.

124
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,080
Player: I could feel their trepidation.

125
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,640
I could feel their eyes like
darting from player to player

126
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,240
Thinking: Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit ...

127
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,800
I could feel it, you know.

128
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,360
Rob: So it's just putting some
pressure on them

129
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,000
and hopefully breaking them down.

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,240
But everything is on them.

131
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,960
There's no pressure on us whatsoever.

132
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,160
Steelers. Steelers.

133
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,880
NIC: Well, tomorrow
we've got the Convicts

134
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,560
and they're pretty much

135
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,160
what this team feel are

136
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,720
one of the main competitors and

137
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,920
that's our first game up.

138
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,520
So we have to have our heads on

139
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,520
first thing.

140
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,800
EAMMON: So in this story, there are

141
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,880
three people I want you to meet:

142
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,920
Simon

143
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,960
Drew

144
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,840
and Nic, the head coach.

145
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,880
NIC: When something goes wrong,

146
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,000
you're just going to POG it.

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,520
So you're going to 'Play Our Game'.

148
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,720
Do you like that?

149
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
I've thought about that for a while.

150
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,560
EAMMON: Nic's been the
Director of Rugby

151
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,280
for 3 years at the Steelers.

152
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,640
NIC: So go and tell that person

153
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,520
about something they did really good

154
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,720
None of this banter about putting

155
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
each other down right now, OK?

156
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,600
I have a lot of secret nerves that I

157
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,120
try to keep as far
away from the boys.

158
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,080
I feel like I'm there with them.

159
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,720
So I pick up all of those player nerves.

160
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,640
So I get that sicky tummy.

161
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,440
I get all those kind of feelings as

162
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,400
if I'm about to walk on the pitch.

163
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,800
EAMMON: And after this tournament,

164
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,360
Nic is stepping down
as the head coach.

165
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,480
NIC: That's kind of the end

166
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,080
of my journey,

167
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,720
really, is to watch them
play their best.

168
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,760
EAMMON: Bit emotional?

169
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,000
NIC: Yeah.
EAMMON: How come?

170
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
NIC: Because...

171
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,360
I've been with them for three years.

172
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,000
And some of the boys ...

173
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,040
been on that journey
for three years.

174
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,440
And we were rubbish.

175
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,280
I mean

176
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,400
we got tonked.

177
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
We had ...

178
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
we, we had

179
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,440
70, 80 points put on us when I first

180
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,560
came to the club

181
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,760
and, um

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,560
I've watched players

183
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
grow.

184
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
So ...

185
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,800
And what I found was

186
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,760
my first year, not so much now,

187
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,160
but in my first year,

188
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,720
I found that I had these
really great players

189
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,040
who had a real lack of self belief.

190
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,440
It's like:

191
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,040
'I can be a really confident
gay person,

192
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,120
and I can be really confident
in the club,

193
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,000
and I can be really confident
with my friends,

194
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,320
and I'm a brilliant person
in the workplace,

195
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,440
and I'm a super successful businessman.

196
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,040
But on the sport's pitch
that doesn't belong to me.

197
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,640
This is not my home.

198
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,280
Can I stop you here?

199
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,000
Every single one of you

200
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,040
have put a 'but' into
your conversation.

201
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,040
Cut that out now because

202
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,840
we're here to look at our positives

203
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,200
because actually we want

204
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,920
to work on our really good stuff.

205
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,400
SIMON: If we get that right here

206
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,880
that will take us a long way.

207
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,120
We started to get it going.

208
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,000
Player: Simon?

209
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,880
NIC: So I think I spent my
first year really

210
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,680
just confirming

211
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,960
to them that

212
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,400
they do belong

213
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,160
that they're sportsmen,

214
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,400
that they are entitled to their

215
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,160
place on the pitch.

216
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,800
So I feel emotional because

217
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,640
I've seen that growth

218
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,120
in these human beings.

219
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,880
And I love my sport.

220
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,600
And I think it's done so many

221
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,360
brilliant things for me

222
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,160
so to see

223
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,120
it do brilliant things for them

224
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,360
just makes me really happy.

225
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,160
Happy?!

226
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,520
Told you I'd cry, ay?

227
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,960
Getting it out in front of you,
not in front

228
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
of the players.

229
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,200
Kept my cool earlier in

230
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,080
the team talk.

231
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,120
ROB: One last thing. Bingham
tradition

232
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,160
for the Steelers.

233
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,120
Get your toes out boys.
Toes now a painting.

234
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,640
EAMMON: So before the
tournament kicks off

235
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,920
first thing's first.

236
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,680
ROB: No excuses.
Blue and green. No excuses.

237
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,120
(upbeat music)

238
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,680
NIC: I would even allow
you to do mine.

239
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,880
Awesome.

240
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,120
(laughter)

241
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,880
EAMMON: So I never wore
nail polish as a kid

242
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,920
but I loved dressing up
in my mom's clothes

243
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,480
and I always wore pink.

244
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,760
So the signs were definitely there.

245
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,960
But the happy kid that I
see in these photos

246
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,680
didn't stay happy for long.

247
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,480
So here I am editing this documentary

248
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,280
and I don't have any pictures

249
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,080
to go over the next bit.

250
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,800
One of my first gay experiences

251
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,120
happened when I was 16.

252
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,280
It was with a boy from one of
my sports classes

253
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,040
He invited me for a sleepover.

254
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,960
We drank.

255
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
We ended up messing around.

256
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,600
And without me knowing it

257
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,240
he set up a camera in the corner of the

258
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,520
room and was filming it.

259
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,000
I remember what happened

260
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
pretty vividly.

261
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,320
It was a Friday afternoon at school.

262
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,760
I'd just finished class and I was

263
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,640
walking back to the dorm in

264
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,320
my boarding school

265
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,040
and it was like a scene from a movie.

266
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,840
People were looking at me,

267
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,000
whispering, sniggering.

268
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,320
Someone yelled out this boy's
surname at me

269
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,560
and was laughing.

270
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,520
The blood started rushing to my face.

271
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,240
My world was spinning.

272
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,320
It was almost like I was floating
outside my body

273
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,200
having this kind of
out of body experience.

274
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,640
This was the moment
I was going to be outed.

275
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,360
I went into the room in my
boarding house

276
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,120
and I tried to stay calm.

277
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,520
And finally someone told me
what had happened.

278
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,720
This boy had come to school
with the videotape

279
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,320
and shown it.

280
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,000
And this was probably one of

281
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,640
the worst moments in my life

282
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,400
being outed at an all boys school.

283
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,600
I was so desperate for help that

284
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,640
I called my dad and said

285
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,840
that we were drunk and messing around.

286
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,000
He went down to the boy's parent's

287
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,360
house and destroyed the tape.

288
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,080
And I'll be forever grateful for him

289
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,160
for doing that.

290
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,800
And we didn't really

291
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,680
talk about whether I was gay or not.

292
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,320
I certainly didn't bring it up.

293
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,680
But the bullying went from
bad to worse.

294
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,080
Before I was just surviving

295
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,120
and now I felt like

296
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,600
I was drowning.

297
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,800
SIMON: Is the sound working?

298
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Are we ready to go?

299
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,520
We're going to start?
Are you rolling?

300
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,280
- Yeah
- Oh, we're rolling?

301
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,960
Okay.

302
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,040
EAMMON: So Simon is the second
person I want you to meet.

303
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,920
Until recently, he played rugby

304
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,600
at a fairly high level in Birmingham

305
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,800
and north London.

306
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,480
But he wasn't out.

307
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,200
SIMON: I was a guy who knew from the

308
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,320
age of about 10 years old that

309
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,840
he was attracted to the same

310
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,760
sex that decided

311
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,440
very early that that was
just not a thing.

312
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,400
I just didn't see how I could come out

313
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,920
and still do what I wanted to do.

314
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,080
I didn't really know I was in a struggle

315
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,520
until

316
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,880
Yeah, I decided that, you know,

317
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,960
obviously people settle down

318
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,680
and start getting married and ...

319
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,840
Yeah, I um.

320
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Yeah.

321
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,920
I guess I um ...

322
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,760
I changed my mind and it was

323
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,720
kind of weird, like, to have

324
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,600
this whole life philosophy
that had worked.

325
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,840
I was happy.

326
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,760
And I was like, yeah,
privately I knew that I was gay

327
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,080
but I was like: I'm going to be
the uncle and the

328
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,640
best friend and the son.

329
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,120
And I don't need a relationship.

330
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,480
And it's weird. I used to look at --

331
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,560
sounds so childlike, but because

332
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,800
this view was formed
when I was a kid.

333
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,560
We got a black labrador
when I was 12

334
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,880
and I used to always say

335
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,600
Rolo doesn't need a partner,

336
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,960
like he's happy just bouncing around

337
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,000
and goes for a walk in the park.

338
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
So I always say,

339
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,400
I based my life decisions around

340
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,720
the black labrador family pet,

341
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,520
right?

342
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,800
Which is strange.

343
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,640
EAMMON: Two years ago,
Simon realised it was time

344
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,920
to be his true self.

345
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,320
SIMON: When I went through
the process of trying to

346
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,440
you know, deciding I wanted
to come out as gay

347
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,440
I was shocked by

348
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,040
how much

349
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
there was built in.

350
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
And it was.

351
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,920
It was ... obviously
a lot of it was in me

352
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,520
that I didn't know, you know.

353
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,120
Trying to think ... telling my
little brother ... it was

354
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,640
we went for a walk up
and down the river

355
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,240
My little brother is the most welcoming guy.

356
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,360
There's no way he's gonna
have a problem with it.

357
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,800
I really struggled.

358
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,240
And we were walked up and down

359
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
up and down.

360
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,480
I walk like one more walk, one more
walk, one more walk.

361
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
And

362
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,080
I just couldn't say the words.

363
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,200
And I was ahhh.

364
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,800
Even though at this point

365
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,080
I'm thinking he must know what I'm
about to say, right?

366
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,960
But he wouldn't do it for me.

367
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,880
In the end after about literally
an hour and a half

368
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,920
I said Tom, I said you've

369
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,720
you've got a gay brother and it's not Dave,

370
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,520
that's all I could say, our older brother.

371
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,440
And he was, yeah.

372
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,280
He said I'm really

373
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,160
I'm really happy because

374
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,800
he recognised that wasn't the start.

375
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,960
That was the

376
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,920
I guess the um

377
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,960
culmination of a lot of thinking

378
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,160
over the previous 12 or 18 months.

379
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,920
EAMMON: But as Simon took his first

380
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,040
steps out of the closet, he tripped.

381
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,960
He'd fallen in love with a childhood friend

382
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,080
a straight guy, who we'll call Jack.

383
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,560
Jack said some things that he

384
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,120
probably didn't think about how it

385
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,760
would impact SIMON

386
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,400
and they cut very deep.

387
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,480
EAMMON : Did that lead
to the other sort of stuff

388
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,160
like the depression?

389
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,280
Or feed into it at least?

390
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,280
SIMON: Yeah.

391
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,600
Yeah, definitely.

392
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,920
EAMMON: Simon's being very worried

393
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,280
about this part of the documentary

394
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,600
because he doesn't want to blame

395
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,360
Jack.

396
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,880
He understands it was a difficult

397
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,480
situation for both of them.

398
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,400
Jack was brought up to believe that

399
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,880
being gay was unnatural and wrong.

400
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,080
But nonetheless, his words had

401
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,360
a very big impact.

402
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,280
SIMON: Then ...

403
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,680
I ...

404
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,080
I found, I found ... um ...

405
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,920
I found the road from there a lot

406
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,880
harder than I expected.

407
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,800
ALEX: This week is a special

408
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,200
time for our club.

409
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,480
We've got six teams.

410
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,480
We are the biggest component
of this tournament.

411
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,800
We're going to go out and give it

412
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,400
our absolute best.

413
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,960
NIC: And I just want to say

414
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,880
just love every moment that
you're on the pitch.

415
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,040
And then Sunday night, just go wild.

416
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,360
(group cheers)

417
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,760
NIC: So we got a sixth place last time

418
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,360
And I believe with the set

419
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,560
of players that we have and the team

420
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,120
that we have

421
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,360
that we're in with a chance

422
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,560
to actually come away with a win.

423
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,960
Stop no pictures, no pictures.

424
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,280
ROB: This is where it starts.
First game.

425
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,440
NIC: There's a few players that
the nerves are

426
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,920
overtaking them a little bit.

427
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,600
But I'm trying to keep them

428
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,000
keep them nice and low.

429
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,960
Keep them calm.

430
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Nerves?

431
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,320
Should be buzzing.

432
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Good nerves. They're good nerves.

433
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,160
ALEX: So starting line up.

434
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,960
Drew McDowell at loose head prop.

435
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,280
NIC: I think they're all worrying

436
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,280
because this is their main competition.

437
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,160
So if they keep everything really positive

438
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,880
they'll focus on their strengths and

439
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,880
not let the kind of, um ...

440
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,960
that kind of voice

441
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,960
talk them down.

442
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,920
EAMMON: So game one.

443
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,200
The Sydney Convicts.

444
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,640
The Steelers need to win
3 of their first 4 round games

445
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,040
to make it to the semi-finals.

446
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,520
And this is set to be the toughest.

447
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,320
ROB: We are used to pressured games.

448
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,880
We are used to fucking contact.

449
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,720
EAMMON: The Steelers score first
with a penalty goal.

450
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,880
But then the Convicts take the lead

451
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,120
with one try and then another.

452
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,400
Half time, we're down and points

453
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,480
and down a man with concussion.

454
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,280
ALEX: 20 minutes we've got here.
PLAYER: We've done this before.

455
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,760
We've done this before
and we're going to do it again!

456
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,560
You absolutely how it in you!

457
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,680
You've got more in that tank!
More to give!

458
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,680
C'mon on!

459
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,960
EAMMON: Final score ...
Sydney Convicts - 12

460
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,560
Kings Cross Steelers - 3.

461
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,360
NIC: I'm going to say one thing.

462
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,280
That shit show at the end

463
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,640
is not Steeler's way.

464
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,960
And if I see that one more time,

465
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
you're off the game,
you're off the tournament

466
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,680
because you're not playing
in my fucking team.

467
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,640
Okay?

468
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,280
I'm not having that bullshit.

469
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,960
We're at a tournament

470
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,000
with a brotherhood here.

471
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,960
Not having it.

472
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Full stop.

473
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,920
Last word on that - number one.

474
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,000
Number two ...

475
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,960
we didn't trust our structure
for about 18 minutes, okay?

476
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,280
We need to do what
we're really good at, okay?

477
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,080
What we are really good at.

478
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,040
So we're going to learn from that.

479
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,680
We're gonna step up from that

480
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,280
because I'm disappointed

481
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,760
you're disappointed

482
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,600
and there's plenty more in the tank.

483
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
OK?

484
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,120
NIC: I think that I

485
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,040
probably give out

486
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,360
this really fearsome (laughs)

487
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,160
I would say I'm
probably a fierce

488
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,320
female.

489
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,400
And so I might

490
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,560
just slightly terrify

491
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,440
a couple of people.

492
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,000
And that's OK, because

493
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,320
I kind of quite like that fierce

494
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,640
female part.

495
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,680
But those people that

496
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,480
spend time trying to
get to know me

497
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,760
realise actually

498
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,120
I'm a bit of a pussy cat.

499
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,880
NIC: You are a fantastic team.

500
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,680
Believe in your structure.

501
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,200
Believe in the way that we play

502
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,920
rugby the Steelers way.

503
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,800
SIMON: We decided just before kick off

504
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,920
we're going to throw the first game

505
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,880
so we can stay undercover

506
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,520
so these boys think that they got us

507
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,960
but they haven't.

508
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,320
Nah, they came at us

509
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,560
with a lot of physicality.

510
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,760
DREW: But I think if we keep
building on through

511
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,280
tournament, each game,

512
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,920
keep working through our structures,

513
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,640
we'll see Convicts in the final and

514
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,160
then get a second chance at it.

515
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,880
PLAYER: Beaten by my old team.

516
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,120
So that's never a good thing.

517
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,840
Put some good play together in the
second half and hopefully we can

518
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,520
come up against them in the final.

519
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
Fuck!

520
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,520
EAMMON: So while the players recover,

521
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,120
NIC snuck away to play a quick game herself.

522
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,960
The last time she wore rugby boots,

523
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,840
she was playing for Wales.

524
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,400
NIC: I think I've gone a bit crazy

525
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,320
and decided to come out of retirement.

526
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,240
- How many years?
- Six years.

527
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,960
- So who are you playing for and what position?

528
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,480
- I'm not sure. We're just playing 10s.

529
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,400
I'm playing where ever I'm put.

530
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,320
- Oh God! Is it a big deal for you?
- No, well, yeah maybe.

531
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,200
- Good luck.
- We'll see.

532
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,400
EAMMON: So how does a gay woman

533
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,320
come to coach a gay men's rugby club?

534
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,320
NIC: Okay, so Gilbert Evans ...

535
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,520
born, bred Caerphilly.

536
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,600
Played rugby, football and cricket.

537
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,520
Refereed in later life.

538
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,800
Treasurer of Caerphilly Rugby Club.

539
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Hugely disappointed that I was a girl

540
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,520
and told me so in no uncertain
terms when I was about 12

541
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,160
and I was the only grandchild

542
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
so he was stuck with me at that point.

543
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,960
My brother and sister came along
a bit later on.

544
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,400
And informed me that in his disappointment

545
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,240
that he'd have to put up with it

546
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,760
and that he's decided to pretend

547
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,320
that I am a boy on a Saturday afternoon.

548
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,360
So I got my first season ticket to Cardiff Rugby Club

549
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,800
aged twelve when I went to senior school.

550
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,120
From the age of 12, my grandfather took me.

551
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,000
I was allowed to swear once
we got through the stalls.

552
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,160
But as soon as we got through
the turnstiles on the way out,

553
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,640
no more swearing.

554
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,840
And he stood by my side

555
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
for

556
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,560
seven years and

557
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,280
taught me the referee's perspective,

558
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,200
taught me the fullback's perspective,

559
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,800
the ten's perspective,

560
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,240
and just talked me through the rugby match.

561
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,960
He taught me why that penalty happened,

562
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,040
what was happening in that ruck,

563
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,880
why was that scrum pulled down.

564
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,880
And he just ...

565
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,000
he loved sharing that knowledge with me.

566
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,480
And we had just this connection.

567
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,840
So age 17,

568
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,520
I got my first car

569
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,280
and literally the first thing I did

570
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,160
was drive on a Tuesday night down to rugby.

571
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,920
So this game that I knew

572
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,720
inside out

573
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,400
I'd never played.

574
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,480
So possibly one of the most exciting nights
of my life.

575
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,360
And at the time, I was about eight stone

576
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,440
so a little bit smaller.

577
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,800
And I played on the wing

578
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,000
and I just I thought this is the
best thing in the world.

579
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
So

580
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,000
I played at university.

581
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,160
Then I went off to the university

582
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,680
and I got into the university team

583
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,200
I came home at Christmas

584
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,320
and my grandfather said to me,

585
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,080
"Ah, I'm just so ashamed of myself"

586
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,680
And I said why grandad?
And he was like,

587
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,640
"Oh, your grandmother's got
it in for me, it's all my fault."

588
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,720
I said, what's happened?

589
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,920
"You're going to get breast cancer."

590
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,400
I'm like what do you mean
I'm going to get breast cancer?

591
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,360
He's like, "Well, all those tackling.

592
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,800
Is there anything you can have,
like chest pads?"

593
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,640
I'm like, I'm not going to get breast cancer

594
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,640
from rugby.

595
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,880
He's like, "Yeah but you're going to

596
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,200
take all those hits to your breasts."

597
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,920
I'm like, you really do not need to be worrying

598
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,960
about my breasts.

599
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,200
My breasts are all good.

600
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,600
And he's like, "And your teeth.

601
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,120
You've got such nice teeth."

602
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,160
So was he was super disappointed.

603
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,840
And he blamed himself for my

604
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,360
love of rugby.

605
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,360
So

606
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,400
he had a major stroke as I went to university.

607
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,040
And he spent the rest of his life,

608
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,760
twelve years, in a nursing home.

609
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
So

610
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,440
my first Six Nations playing for Wales --

611
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,760
and I cried then too by the way.

612
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,960
I'm a cryer --

613
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,600
And I line up against Ireland

614
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,000
and I look up

615
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,360
and my nan is there, and she's only four foot ten.

616
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,840
So there's this tiny little woman,

617
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,320
with this massive scarf and a big wolly hat

618
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,720
watching me, waving at me.

619
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,720
And

620
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,960
she come up to me at the end of the game

621
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,400
and she's like, "Your grandfather

622
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,240
would have been just so proud of you right now.

623
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,880
He never said it

624
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,880
because he was always a bit frightened

625
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,680
you were going to get hurt,

626
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,760
but he'd be really proud of you."

627
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,640
So, he never got to see me play.

628
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,640
But

629
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,840
he's always with me

630
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,120
on the pitch, near the pitch.

631
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,240
So ... hence the reason

632
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,920
why I'm a rugby obsessed.

633
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,520
EAMMON: Do you think you feel him here

634
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,360
here with you this week?

635
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,720
NIC: Yes, and I think ...

636
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:01,800
he was immensely proud of all my achievements.

637
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,120
Anything that I did.

638
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,960
He would drive me anywhere.

639
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,400
He would fuel that passion.

640
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,560
So I think

641
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,600
for him to know

642
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,000
that so many years on

643
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,560
that he still fuels my passion.

644
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,560
I think ... that's pretty special, isn't it?

645
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,720
DREW: I told you not to kill anyone.

646
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,800
NIC: I didn't.

647
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,840
I was nice. I played nice Evans.

648
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,320
COACH: You love a bit of constant
infringing don't you?

649
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,640
In at the side, clobbering that bird.

650
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,400
- Still go it. Could've been a contender.
- I wish.

651
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,120
EAMMON: You got so close at the end.

652
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,080
- My God. That was so good.
- Ahhh! I should've scored.

653
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,160
- NIC, how was that?
- Horrendous.

654
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,960
I can remember why I retired now.

655
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,120
Oh well.

656
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,160
- But worth doing?
- Yeah it was really nice to play in the Bingham Cup.

657
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,480
So, know what the boys feel like.

658
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,800
- What did it feel like?

659
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,960
Um really nervous.

660
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,240
First game in a long time.

661
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,480
Felt really nervous.

662
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,360
I just thought I'd mess it up for everybody.

663
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,000
- But you played awesome.

664
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,560
I didn't do very much.

665
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,480
It's good to get a few hits in.

666
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,880
- Thanks NIC.

667
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,480
EAMMON: Is your gran still alive?

668
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,200
NIC: Ahh, Yeah.

669
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,800
EAMMON: Do you think you call her after

670
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,600
and let her know how you go this week?

671
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,280
NIC: She's in hospital.

672
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,640
But she asks me about my boys.

673
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,560
So I tell her that I coach the gay men's rugby team

674
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,200
and she loves that.

675
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,120
She's like, oh, that's funny.

676
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,440
And I think I think she really loves that

677
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,840
because she always talks about the fact

678
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,440
that life was so different in her era.

679
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,920
I think

680
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,920
she loves the fact

681
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,680
that our society

682
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,240
now embrace gay people

683
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,600
and we're able to have these amazing things

684
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,800
like the Bingham Cup.

685
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,760
We're able to safely walk the streets of Amsterdam

686
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,720
and we're able to celebrate

687
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,040
our own sporting lives.

688
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,360
And I feel that's what Bingham is.

689
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,160
It's a celebration of gay sporting lives.

690
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,240
So I noticed that

691
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,280
I didn't have an American flag in our tent.

692
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,960
So I brought this

693
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,840
and then this is the Man of the Day award.

694
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,800
It's normally a skirt

695
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,520
but it would have been sacrilegious

696
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,200
to cover the flag.

697
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,480
EAMMON: what did you think
of the guy

698
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,400
with the Spangled Banner Speedo.

699
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,880
CHRIS: Oh right. Ummm...

700
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,960
Yes that was quite an interesting outfit.

701
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,280
I wonder he'll wear to the closing party.

702
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,920
CASPAR: Oh you're wondering?

703
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,640
I don't want this.

704
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,000
Get this camera off.

705
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,840
My focus first and foremost is on the rugby.

706
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,800
- Yeah, exactly.

707
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,280
- But second...

708
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,160
EAMMON: speaking of which ...

709
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,880
time for the next game

710
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,320
the Emerald Warriors from Dublin.

711
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,040
NIC: We're going to go out there and
play lots of attacking rugby

712
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,200
right from the off.

713
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,760
There's no taking anything for granted.

714
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,760
Just as many points.

715
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,840
Be my top pain in the arse today.

716
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,760
EAMMON: 73 - 0 to the Steelers.

717
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,320
They're back in the competition

718
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,120
and need just two more wins

719
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,360
if they have a chance of going all the way.

720
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
NIC: Thought you were fabulous.

721
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,280
Get some food on board as soon as possible.

722
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,040
PLAYER: Don't worry about that Nic.

723
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,680
Got some down here.

724
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,000
ROB: Louis, as you're a PE teacher

725
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,200
you can fucking launder the shirts.

726
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,560
So shirts off.

727
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,280
And also, last thing for me.

728
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,080
Where is he? Congratulations.

729
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,240
You scored more tries in this tournament

730
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,440
than your boyfriend.

731
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,400
ALL: AYYY!

732
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,800
EAMMON: Well, remember I said

733
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,680
there are three people I want you to meet?

734
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,520
Well, it's kind of four.

735
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,320
Drew and Drewalicious.

736
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,280
DREW: I think Drag just came along

737
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,880
as a bit of a fluke.

738
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,680
EAMMON: So, yes, apparently joining
a gay rugby club

739
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,840
can turn you into a drag queen.

740
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,680
So Drew used to be in charge of

741
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,240
social events at the club

742
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,080
and one night before a big game

743
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,240
when they couldn't drink alcohol

744
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,120
he decided to swap the spirits for stilettos.

745
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,880
DREW: I was smaller than I am now,

746
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,000
but I was still quite stocky.

747
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,080
So to see three quite stocky rugby players

748
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,640
in heels and makeup doing a dance.

749
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,840
No one was expecting it.

750
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,680
So they were just absolutely floored.

751
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,800
And then I realised in that moment

752
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,320
I got to do multiple
things that I love doing.

753
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,200
I got to dance.

754
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,040
I got to perform.

755
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,360
And I got to play a character.

756
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,440
I've created a persona as a drag queen

757
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,120
that is probably an extension of myself,

758
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,280
but just a very wild

759
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,560
and very kind of exaggerated sense.

760
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,720
And I was like,

761
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,920
how can I make this actually last

762
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,760
as long as possible?

763
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,000
Because I kind of love it.

764
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,080
I love being centre of attention.

765
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,960
Everyone knows I love being centre of attention.

766
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,960
And I think it's partly because I
like making people laugh.

767
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,720
I like seeing people smile.

768
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,720
EAMMON: The Devalicious drag show

769
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,440
was so successful

770
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,040
that the club decided to put on a public event

771
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,840
and make it a fundraiser.

772
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,160
DREW: And I was like oh,

773
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,840
I'm possibly going to get nervous again.

774
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,760
And then the first song came on,

775
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,120
which was the first routine that
we did in Manchester.

776
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,640
As soon as we got on stage,

777
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,960
I was like, no, no,

778
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,680
I love this.

779
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,360
Seeing 600 people just looking at me

780
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,480
owning the stage.

781
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,800
I was like, this is something I love.

782
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,400
I kind of soaked it up

783
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,840
and then I got off stage

784
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,400
and it was like I don't want to leave

785
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,720
and then I realised
I don't have to

786
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,320
because I have four other acts.

787
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,560
So it's perfect!

788
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,280
EAMMON: And now it's turned

789
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,840
into an annual event

790
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,080
at the famous Heaven nightclub in London.

791
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,520
And there's even a spinoff.

792
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,560
Steeler's Drag Race.

793
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,080
Yep, these are all rugby players.

794
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,200
And they take it very seriously.

795
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,520
There's a reading challenge

796
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,480
which is kind of like a roast

797
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,080
A Lip-Sync for your life.

798
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,480
And of course, a Lip-Sync, for your legacy

799
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,160
to crown the winner.

800
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,280
The winner is 'Anya Knees'.

801
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,000
DREW: We had some pushback,

802
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,840
especially when we did Heaven

803
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,440
and we did a lot of photoshoots
and promotion ...

804
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,240
being drag queens in the locker room

805
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,320
with other rugby players

806
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,520
and creating that image of butch queens

807
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,640
in drag

808
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,600
and butch queens out of drag.

809
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,840
And some of our previous members

810
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,720
didn't really appreciate that

811
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,400
because they thought we were feeding
into that gay stereotype

812
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,040
that gay men are only sissies.

813
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,880
Or only want to play dress up

814
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,800
in girl's clothes when actually

815
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,360
they looked at it the wrong way.

816
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,400
We were actually welcoming
and promoting

817
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,280
and kind of congratulating people

818
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,160
who are their own people

819
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,040
that they can be rugby players

820
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,520
that they can be drag queens

821
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,720
they can be whatever they want.

822
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,520
And that's not something
to really look down upon.

823
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,080
That's actually something to embrace

824
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,080
and say that's fine.

825
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,040
EAMMON: Day two and the Steelers are
still in with a chance

826
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,040
if they win their next two games.

827
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,680
And just thinking about what Drew was saying

828
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,160
about embracing who you are

829
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,880
and sometimes the hardest person to convince

830
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,000
is yourself.

831
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,680
SIMON: I'm thinking I'm about
to talk about ...

832
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,640
I guess because it's relevant ...

833
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,560
depression ... you know?

834
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,560
which

835
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,080
I'm not like ...

836
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,240
You want to be kind of proud,
don't you right?

837
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,240
You told me you were filming and stuff

838
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,200
and do I want, like, a documentary about ...

839
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,560
where I'm talking about my depression.

840
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,680
Not really.

841
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,600
But it is part ...

842
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,440
It is part of the ...

843
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,960
It is part of the story.

844
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,200
EAMMON: Simon grew up in Birmingham,

845
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,800
an industrial city

846
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,360
and not the easiest of places to come out.

847
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,880
After moving to London

848
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,040
he eventually started telling his friends

849
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,720
and their support was mostly overwhelming.

850
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,400
But the situation with his childhood friend Jack

851
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,240
hadn't improved.

852
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,960
Simon got himself into a muddle

853
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,840
and pulled away from everything he loved,

854
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,400
including rugby,

855
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,720
and he almost quit the sport
he loved to altogether.

856
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,920
But then searching the internet, one day

857
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,000
he stumbled across the Steelers

858
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,720
and he decided to give it a go.

859
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,280
SIMON: There was a couple of weeks
while I was training ...

860
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,920
I wasn't even at work.

861
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,600
I was off work, sick,

862
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,000
lying on the floor most of the day.

863
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,360
Could hardly get out of the flat

864
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,960
and then just be waiting

865
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,400
for six o'clock to come

866
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,480
and I could get my boots on

867
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,440
and get out to play rugby.

868
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,400
And that's how it was for
the first couple months.

869
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,640
But it did ...

870
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,960
it made me smile, you know

871
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,840
and I was so quiet when I started.

872
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,480
I was like ... people were like 'oh'

873
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,480
People now ...

874
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,640
cause they were like ...

875
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,800
they look back ... and they were like

876
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,720
you were quiet when you started

877
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,880
I was always really quiet.

878
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,240
I was just there to play rugby

879
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,560
and just experience it.

880
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,920
Also I was excited because I knew

881
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,280
that it was a turning moment.

882
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,320
Rugby ...

883
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,080
It sounds like it's a bloody religion

884
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,080
when I say it this way

885
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,080
but I'd started to question rugby

886
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,120
which is nuts

887
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,600
because I played rugby
since I was seven years old.

888
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,560
When I got to the rugby club

889
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,360
and it was bringing out all the best of me

890
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,480
but I was still depressed

891
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,000
I was lying on the floor, you know?

892
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,440
I'd then used up my entire deck of cards, right?

893
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,560
And this is where I think

894
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,680
I finally realised that I was ...

895
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,440
you know, would be diagnosed
with depression, was ...

896
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,120
I had my rugby back.

897
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,840
I had everything on paper
was then fine again

898
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,640
but I was still feeling really low.

899
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,400
So, um...

900
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,800
Yeah, I remember. It was weird.

901
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,440
I was ...

902
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,720
Bit of a theme.

903
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,040
I was lying on the floor in the flat

904
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,960
and my friend kept ringing me and saying,

905
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,200
"Have you called the doctor?"

906
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,960
And I was like, yeah,
I'll do it in ten minutes.

907
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,120
I'll do it in ten minutes.

908
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,000
It was the middle of the day.

909
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,200
I wasn't at work and he's like
phoning me up.

910
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,360
And he goes, "I found the number that
you need to dial,

911
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,640
you need to dial this number,
just dial it."

912
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,480
And he sent it to me.

913
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,560
And I'm like okay, I'm on going to dial it.

914
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,160
Ten minutes later, "Have you dialed it?"

915
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,320
No, no ...

916
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:23,480
I will be forever grateful for that guy

917
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,640
because he phoned the number in the end

918
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,640
he got me the appointment for the next day

919
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,040
and he said, "Get yourself to the doctors,"

920
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,920
and I felt this like weight lifted.

921
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,320
I told him how I'd been feeling

922
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,400
for the last 18 months prior.

923
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,720
And he said, "It's a shame
that you've come to me now."

924
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,520
"You've definitely been depressed."

925
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,840
By that point, I was just ready.
Tell me what to do?!

926
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,640
And it'd spent 18 months saying

927
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,920
no anti-depressants - none of that stuff.

928
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,400
I started on a course
of antidepressants then.

929
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,560
The psychiatrist said to me

930
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,360
"Once you've got through that first month,

931
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,760
you're gonna be chatting to people in the lift

932
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,840
and on the bus,"

933
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,920
and I was like no mate you have no idea.

934
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,240
I'm not going be talking to people in the lift.

935
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,360
And I'll never forget, three months later

936
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,120
going into work, "hey, how's it going?"

937
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,840
Then I caught myself ... oh, it's that thing.

938
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,240
SIMON: How are you feeling Jono?

939
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,680
JONO: I had a wank this morning
so I feel great. No, no ...

940
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,160
- No, how you feeling about the game?
- Ah ... yeah ... you know.

941
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,280
- How many Bingham's you played?

942
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,600
- 4th Bingham mate.

943
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:47,080
SIMON: So I now advocate
anti-depressants.

944
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,360
I mean, it's weird now I'm talking about it

945
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,600
it feels fine.

946
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,520
I've tried to do my best best to tell people.

947
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,080
I don't see anything wrong with it

948
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,720
and eventually I hope to get off them.

949
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,880
Obviously I had a happy life

950
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,160
up until a couple of years ago, so ...

951
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,480
Should be okay.

952
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,600
EAMMON: I didn't realise how many
scars I had

953
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,120
until after I left school

954
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,200
got away from the bullying

955
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,040
came out and everyone was accepting.

956
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,240
But I still didn't feel happy.

957
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,840
Like Simon,

958
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,360
like so many gay people

959
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,440
despite putting on a smile, I was depressed.

960
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,480
There were many days

961
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,120
where I couldn't get out of bed.

962
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,280
I graduated law school
and got a great job.

963
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,040
But during work sometimes

964
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,640
I would just burst into tears

965
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,840
for no reason.

966
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,920
I couldn't handle it.

967
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,720
So I quit.

968
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,040
And I started working at a TV station
where a friend worked

969
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,120
and eventually got a job as a reporter.

970
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,400
And I thought, great.

971
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,360
My dream job.

972
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,400
Finally, I'll be happy.

973
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,240
But still, suicidal thoughts
kept knocking on the door.

974
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,320
and more than once I even wrote

975
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,720
a goodbye note.

976
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,600
And the only thing stopping me

977
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,000
was the devastation

978
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,600
that it would cause my family.

979
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,920
Again, like Simon, I started taking anti-depressants

980
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,280
and when it levelled me out

981
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,600
I finally realised

982
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,120
that I needed to stop trying to do things

983
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,240
that I thought would make other people like me.

984
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,600
So I quit my job again.

985
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,320
I packed up my life.

986
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:36,720
And I moved to London.

987
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,080
And that's where I found the Steelers.

988
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,600
NIC: As a team, we need more from you.

989
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,080
OK? hold yourself to really high standards.

990
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,080
EAMMON: So just two games left

991
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,560
until the semi-finals.

992
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,800
Next up, the Manchester Village Spartans.

993
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,480
So these two teams share a rich history.

994
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,000
In fact, in '98, three years after
the Steelers formed,

995
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,840
the Spartans became the world's

996
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,720
second gay rugby team.

997
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,200
And a year on, they held a history
making rugby match

998
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,120
between two gay teams.

999
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,160
The world was slowly becoming more

1000
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,720
accepting of gay people,

1001
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,000
and these two clubs were doing their bit,

1002
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,960
one game of rugby at a time.

1003
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,040
And there were a few surprises.

1004
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,920
First, it was a surprise to many of
the straight teams

1005
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,960
that a gay team could
actually be quite good.

1006
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,520
And second, it was a surprise,

1007
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,160
well, at least to the Steelers,

1008
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,280
that they didn't experience much,

1009
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,080
if any, homophobia on the pitch.

1010
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,440
So starting with London's
King's Cross Steelers,

1011
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,720
with the Manchester Village Spartans

1012
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:56,800
coming next ...

1013
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,080
a movement was beginning.

1014
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,640
Teams from around the world were forming.

1015
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,760
From Washington

1016
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:05,200
to Wellington, San Francisco.

1017
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,560
And from those humble beginnings,

1018
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:10,960
there are now 60 gay clubs around the world

1019
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,200
with more than two thousand

1020
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,680
queer rugby players.

1021
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:25,960
And for me, this is what makes it so special.

1022
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,120
Everyone here, every player

1023
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,600
has gone through that same struggle

1024
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,760
realising they're different

1025
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,680
and coming to terms with it.

1026
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,800
Take Matt, for example.

1027
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,880
He's from a devout religious family in Ireland

1028
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,720
and he was working on a missionary ship in Asia

1029
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,640
and texting a guy who was helping him

1030
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,600
come to terms with his sexuality

1031
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,800
when he accidently messaged

1032
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,800
the entire conversation

1033
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,720
to his congregation.

1034
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,000
They wanted him to go to counselling

1035
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,640
and stand up in front
of the entire ship and confess.

1036
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,880
But Matt refused.

1037
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,400
And if being outed in this way

1038
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,240
wasn't bad enough

1039
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:15,800
they then kicked him off
the boat at the next port

1040
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,720
without a cent to his name

1041
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,600
alone, to find his own way home.

1042
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,680
In this moment, on this pitch

1043
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,240
to this team, he is nothing

1044
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,680
but a champion.

1045
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,200
And that's something that everyone

1046
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,560
deserves to feel.

1047
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,720
Final score, Steelers - 52

1048
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,920
the Spartans nil.

1049
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,000
So two wins, one loss

1050
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,040
and only one game to go

1051
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,640
until the knockouts.

1052
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,960
MATT: I was trying to step

1053
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,600
but my hamstring kept kind of tugging.

1054
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,760
So I just just started pushing people

1055
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,080
and it was like the slowest try ever.

1056
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,440
But we got there.

1057
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,160
NIC: Push out. Three seconds.

1058
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,800
3, 2, 1.

1059
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,240
SAM: Feeling really good ... it's um ...

1060
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,200
the spirits definitely picked up.

1061
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,040
It's nice to be back on a winning streak

1062
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,080
after the first game.

1063
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,120
Miles: So how many shots have
we got at this?

1064
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,840
SAM: He's not a trained actor.

1065
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,920
EAMMON: So now for a bit of downtime.

1066
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,160
Take one.

1067
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,120
MILES: You good to go?

1068
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,680
- Hey Sam, you look like you've
been through the wars man.

1069
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,960
- Yeah. I think I'm gonna be full mummy

1070
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,200
by the end of tomorrow.

1071
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,120
- One more?

1072
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,120
- Do it again.

1073
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,640
- I can't do this.

1074
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,080
- You ever had a nice massage boy?!

1075
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,360
MORGAN: I'm just gonna stretch, sorry.

1076
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:31,880
- Guys, guys.

1077
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,880
- No, bend and snap.

1078
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,800
EAMMON: Take two.

1079
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,640
- Hey Sam, you look like you've
been through the wars.

1080
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:40,480
- Um, yeah. I think I'm
going to be a full mummy.

1081
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,160
JONO: Miles always chatting shit, ay?

1082
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,400
- Don't ever offend me again.

1083
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,560
- Guys, you know you boy's filming here?

1084
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,760
SIMON: Yeah that's why we're here.

1085
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,200
- Oh you're happy now?

1086
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,280
EAMMON: And ... take three.

1087
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,520
- Hey Sam how are you feeling?

1088
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,280
You look like you've been through the wars.

1089
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,680
- Yeah. I think I'm going to be a full mummy

1090
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,680
by the end of tomorrow.

1091
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:20,800
- We good?

1092
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,920
- So terrible! So terrible!

1093
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,080
Sounds so staged.

1094
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,640
EAMMON: Yeah.

1095
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,000
So inside a little less acting,

1096
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,680
a little more relaxing.

1097
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:35,280
DREW: Sorry. Just trying to
zone out for a little while.

1098
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,920
EAMMON: Feeling alright? How you feeling?

1099
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,920
DREW: I'm feeling fine.

1100
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:41,040
Just trying to, like, chill.

1101
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,160
I know it's going to be a big boy game.

1102
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,600
So my body will definitely hurt afterwards.

1103
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,920
MORGAN: Yeah it will girl.
Yeah it will.

1104
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,640
NIC: Feeling a bit nervous.

1105
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,080
I think our backs are up
against the wall, really.

1106
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,960
We've had quite a few injuries

1107
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:02,760
and a few people are hanging on
by a hamstring.

1108
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,960
I think their confidence

1109
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,440
is a thin veil

1110
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,600
under a lot of worrying

1111
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,160
and lack of self belief.

1112
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,280
EAMMON: The San Diego Armada next.

1113
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,160
If we beat them, we'make it

1114
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,360
to the semi-final.

1115
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,920
Try after try,

1116
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,360
the Steelers continue their winning streak.

1117
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,120
So now after this match,

1118
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,680
they're top four in the world.

1119
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,760
Through to the semi-finals.

1120
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,720
NIC: The reason why we got
to this position right now

1121
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,320
is because you chose to take the game

1122
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,200
to them.

1123
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,000
You chose to play

1124
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
our game.

1125
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,000
EAMMON: And as fate would have it,

1126
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,640
our opponent for the semi-final

1127
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,520
is our biggest rival.

1128
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,680
The team that beat us in the first game.

1129
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,360
The Sydney Convicts.

1130
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,560
SIMON: Personal apology from me

1131
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,680
for being quite negative in the second half.

1132
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,200
I'll sought it out for the next game.

1133
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,600
DREW: proud of you all.

1134
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,200
Keep going.

1135
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,800
NIC: Now I'm asking you for more, OK?

1136
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,680
I'm asking you for more. OK?

1137
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,880
Play your game. OK?

1138
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,080
Play our game.

1139
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,080
Brilliant.

1140
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,160
ROB: Get your hands in.
Get your hands in.

1141
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,080
3, 2, 1, Steelers!

1142
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,080
NIC: Yeah don't ask Jono.

1143
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,680
SIMON D: Broke my shoe.

1144
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,520
Looks like we're gonna

1145
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:05,880
come up against Convicts again.

1146
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,800
They only beat us 12-3

1147
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,080
and I'm pretty sure they
only put a lot more points

1148
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:10,080
on other people.

1149
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,360
We know the game they're going to play.

1150
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,280
It's going to be aggressive.

1151
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,600
So we just need to be up ahead of that this time.

1152
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,240
EAMMON: How exciting. Top 4!

1153
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,880
CASPAR: Very exciting.
That was the goal we set ourselves.

1154
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,280
I would say anything now

1155
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,640
is just a cherry on top.

1156
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,840
But we want more.

1157
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,680
ROB: That is disgusting.

1158
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,680
Don't film.

1159
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,520
No one wants to see this!

1160
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,120
MILES: Switch it off. Switch it off.

1161
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,120
Switch it off.

1162
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,760
DREW: It's a bit shit

1163
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,640
we're playing against the Convicts again.

1164
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,240
But I guess we have to play them again anyway.

1165
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,760
I can see your religion.

1166
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,760
STEVE: What have you got
against my waist?

1167
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,080
SIMON: I'm fine. I was shouting
at the referees

1168
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,280
and I said I wouldn't do that.

1169
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,880
I was shouting at them bad.

1170
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,880
I actually know that guy's sister.

1171
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,160
And I met him just then

1172
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,040
for the first time on the pitch.

1173
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,480
That was supposed to be
my personal goal.

1174
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,280
So not too good.

1175
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,800
I'm going to try and find him

1176
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,680
and apologise and start a blank sheet tomorrow.

1177
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,640
EAMMON: Mate, you said you were

1178
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,520
a bit down this morning

1179
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,880
but I see that big smile.

1180
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,480
JONO: He's a lot better
on camera than me.

1181
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,160
- Yeah I was ... rugby helps, hey.

1182
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,080
Yeah, no. I'm good.

1183
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,080
SIMON: You know, one of the hardest ...

1184
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,280
moments definitely in my life so far

1185
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,880
was recovering myself from depression.

1186
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,960
Feeling like myself again.

1187
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,400
I remember probably just the moment

1188
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,280
I was thinking, oh, I'm feeling myself again.

1189
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,000
It was week. I think I had a week of that.

1190
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,240
And then ...

1191
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:00,120
I was actually doing counselling at the time

1192
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:04,320
and I'd done my 15th out of 16 sessions

1193
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,480
and we'd gone all the way through.

1194
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,560
And I'd learnt so much about myself, you know.

1195
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,600
And I just had to write a letter or something

1196
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,200
to summarise this is what I've learnt.

1197
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,720
And I was feeling like,
wrap it up and put it away.

1198
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,560
Yeah, it was a sad week.

1199
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,200
My dad was ...

1200
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,360
became ill.

1201
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,720
You know, he'd had a tumour in his bowel

1202
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,280
for the best part of two years, they think.

1203
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,840
He was in surgery on Monday

1204
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,320
for about seven or eight hours,

1205
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,840
and we were sat there.

1206
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,160
And the weirdest thing, right.

1207
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,720
My, my sister's heavily pregnant

1208
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,320
and

1209
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,600
oh she came over to try and see Dad

1210
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,640
and see if he's out of his operation.

1211
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:50,840
And she just whispered in my ear.

1212
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,960
She said, "My waters have broken."

1213
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,200
And I was like, what?

1214
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,680
And she said "Yeah."

1215
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,920
And I was like where?

1216
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,440
She's like "No, no, it's calm."

1217
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,000
"It is a trickle," she said.

1218
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,960
Sorry for that. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1219
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,240
That's not good for film.

1220
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,400
Her water broke while my dad
was in the operation.

1221
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,400
Then my mum got in the lift.

1222
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,080
I was doing my work in the corridor

1223
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:19,040
and I got a message from my sister's partner

1224
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,040
saying Isabelle Florence Wise Jones

1225
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,760
has just been born.

1226
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,160
I fucking threw the laptop down,

1227
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,560
ran to the stairs,

1228
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:31,720
ran down the stairs, and by the time

1229
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,800
I got the two flights of stairs down

1230
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,040
my mom was there in tears sobbing.

1231
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,800
EAMMON: Simon's dad survived the surgery

1232
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,040
and Simon flew straight here.

1233
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,120
SIMON: Yeah, here we are.

1234
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,320
It's kind of weird.

1235
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,360
It's kind of weird, right?

1236
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,760
They've seen how much this season

1237
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,600
has meant to me.

1238
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,600
So I think it would be nice to

1239
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,320
take a picture on Sunday afternoon

1240
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:58,760
and then send them

1241
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,920
send them a picture of us with our ...

1242
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,400
with our trophy

1243
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,440
That would be cool.

1244
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,960
SIMON: I want to kind of ...

1245
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,600
I wanna win it, right?

1246
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,880
I mean, we're not allowed to say that

1247
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,360
because it's every game

1248
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:19,960
it's every game.

1249
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,160
But I want to win this rugby tournament.

1250
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,560
And I want to contribute ...

1251
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,040
I want to contribute to that.

1252
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,960
I want ... I want to be

1253
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,400
a big part of that.

1254
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,960
EAMMON: I know that feeling.

1255
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,400
Wanting to contribute.

1256
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,000
Wanting to be a big part of something.

1257
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,320
Wanting to belong.

1258
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,920
EAMMON: I remember my first training
session with the Steelers.

1259
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,040
I was overweight and unfit.

1260
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,640
And we warmed up running around the oval

1261
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,360
and I was about a lap behind everyone.

1262
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,280
I didn't want to give up, though

1263
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,960
to embarrass myself in front of everyone.

1264
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,800
And as I was coming around

1265
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,400
finishing the last lap, the whole club

1266
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,440
was standing there clapping,

1267
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,600
cheering me on.

1268
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,360
Something like that

1269
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,520
had never happened to me before.

1270
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,920
And I remember my first game.

1271
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,640
I was so nervous.

1272
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,440
But it all started coming back to me

1273
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,920
from when I was 12.

1274
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,440
I broke through and I scored

1275
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:49,880
the most tries of the match.

1276
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,400
And afterward at the pub

1277
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,240
people were patting me on the back

1278
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,560
coming up to me, congratulating me,

1279
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,080
wanting to get to know me.

1280
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,160
And I remember thinking

1281
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,640
this was one of the best days

1282
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,320
of my life.

1283
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,200
EAMMON: Day three.

1284
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:18,520
Up next, the semi-final
against the Sydney Convicts.

1285
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:21,360
MATT: So annoying because
they got that wee skinny winger.

1286
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:23,640
CHRIS: How are the wingers?

1287
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,400
- He does not look 40, but he's 40.

1288
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,960
and he's just really lanky and skinny.

1289
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:31,960
DREW: I think he's like the first

1290
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,720
daddy twink I've ever met.

1291
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,080
- No, I mean, he's like the
definition of a twink as well.

1292
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:36,760
But he's 40.

1293
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,560
- Daddy.

1294
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,560
- Yeah, it's crazy.

1295
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,000
- A twink daddy?

1296
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,520
- Twonk? He's not a Twonk.

1297
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,320
- Twatty?

1298
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,120
ALL: He's a Twitty!

1299
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,880
- Might want to throw up.

1300
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,040
- Oh, really?

1301
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,040
- Couldn't eat.

1302
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,560
I had to like force down my banana.

1303
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,040
- Did you sleep okay?

1304
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,040
- Somewhat.

1305
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,720
- All my thoughts, all my dreams

1306
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,320
were all rugby, specifically this game.

1307
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:07,880
But it's good. It's good.

1308
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,440
- I had a dream that one of them

1309
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,800
booted me in in the head

1310
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,640
and then I just went feral.

1311
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,080
- All my dreams were related to

1312
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,920
fighting people as well.

1313
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,800
EAMMON: So if you go by points,

1314
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,120
these two teams are the strongest

1315
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,040
in the tournament.

1316
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,240
And it's unfortunate that they're meeting again

1317
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,680
in the semi-finals.

1318
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,360
Whoever wins this will surely go on

1319
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,320
to win the entire competition.

1320
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,040
DREW: Kind of our time to redeem ourselves

1321
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,960
and show them that we can actually beat them.

1322
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,000
It's a beatable game.

1323
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,600
EAMMON: what would that mean to you?

1324
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,400
DREW: Mean fucking the world to me.

1325
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,880
World to everybody actually, all of us.

1326
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,960
EAMMON: And how are you feeling
about yourself?

1327
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,640
SIMON: I don't at this moment.
I don't know, mate.

1328
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,800
You know when you're unsure?

1329
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,400
I'll let you know after the game.

1330
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,920
We are in... we are in with a shot.

1331
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:20,920
A good shot.

1332
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,040
EAMMON: How are the kind of nerves

1333
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:27,120
because you spoke about
how you get very nervous.

1334
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,560
NIC: Not bad yet it's always
just 10 minutes beforehand.

1335
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,520
I feel calm. Feeling relaxed.

1336
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,080
I'm really excited.

1337
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,520
I'm genuinely excited.

1338
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,680
I think for me, the bigger the game the better.

1339
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,240
NIC: In some ways, I felt like

1340
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,800
maybe Steelers would have been

1341
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,400
one of the only clubs

1342
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,520
to have given me the opportunity

1343
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,480
to be Director of Rugby.

1344
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:05,480
So

1345
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:07,840
and I'm really sad

1346
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:08,840
that that's the case.

1347
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,920
And I'm really sad that even now,

1348
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,520
we went to Elford Wanderers
in the Cup final in Essex

1349
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,960
and one of the dignitaries from the league

1350
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,960
went straight up to Alex and spoke to Alex.

1351
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,600
And I was like, actually this is our

1352
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,600
Director of Rugby.

1353
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,600
So I feel like I'm still needed to be

1354
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,000
validated by men.

1355
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,200
I've been the physio.

1356
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,360
I've been the water girl.

1357
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,880
The referee often doesn't recognise me

1358
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,600
so will go straight to Alex

1359
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,720
because obviously he's in charge.

1360
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:42,720
So

1361
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,760
I feel those daily struggles.

1362
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,600
And I don't think the players see it

1363
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,360
because they've gone past
seeing me as a female

1364
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,160
and they just see me as the coach.

1365
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,640
So for them

1366
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,120
my gender is invisible to them.

1367
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,200
I'm just Nic.

1368
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:02,200
But for me, it's always ...

1369
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,920
it's always sitting there with me.

1370
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,640
So I always feel judged.

1371
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,600
I always feel that

1372
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,240
I have to do a better job than other people

1373
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,800
to be able to say

1374
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,320
I'm okay as a coach.

1375
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,960
ALEX: So starting 15
for the semi-final

1376
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,880
against the Sydney Convicts is

1377
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,320
Drew McDowell at lose head.

1378
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:31,640
NIC: I don't think results

1379
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,480
validate who I am

1380
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,320
I think the relationship I have

1381
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:39,120
with majority of the players

1382
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,720
in the whole club

1383
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,720
validates who I am as a coach.

1384
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,840
I feel like I'm appreciated as a coach

1385
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,000
throughout the club

1386
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,920
not just in the first team.

1387
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,720
But I want that to happen

1388
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:52,960
in the outside world.

1389
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:53,840
So

1390
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,520
I think if

1391
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,240
if we won the Bingham Cup

1392
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,800
I could go home

1393
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,040
and I could say

1394
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,280
that I have the best ...

1395
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,760
I have coached the best gay team

1396
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,760
in the world.

1397
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,720
And I think

1398
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,320
yeah, I'd feel pretty proud of that.

1399
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,640
EAMMON: that's beautiful.

1400
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:47,320
NIC: Aggression. Brutality.
Communication.

1401
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,280
Give me A, B, C.

1402
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:50,920
That's all I want from you

1403
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:51,880
for 40 minutes.

1404
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,680
ABC. Aggression.

1405
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,360
Brutality at the contact.

1406
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:57,280
Communication with each other.

1407
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,840
You can focus on that
as you walk down.

1408
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,000
Those three things.

1409
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,800
Nothing changes here.

1410
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,960
PLAYER: This is what it feels like!

1411
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,920
This is what it smells like!

1412
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,840
Here we go Steelers!

1413
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:16,160
This is our game!
This is our tournament!

1414
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,160
PLAYER: We have made promises
to ourselves!

1415
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,360
We have made promises to each other!

1416
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:38,960
And today we fucking deliver
on those promises!

1417
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,320
EAMMON: Here we are.
Face to face

1418
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,080
with our toughest competition.

1419
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,880
The biggest thing standing between us

1420
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,760
and the Bingham Cup.

1421
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:23,080
It's another brutal game.

1422
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,040
But we push them back.

1423
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,600
And then the ball goes loose
over our try line.

1424
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:29,880
The Convicts pick it up.

1425
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,000
But we rip it from them

1426
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,400
and score the first try.

1427
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,600
The Convicts fight back.

1428
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,960
But we stumble.

1429
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:49,920
And you can see just how much this means

1430
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,400
to each and every one of us.

1431
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:00,760
Half time comes
and we manage to hold the lead.

1432
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:01,760
CAPTAIN: Keep that in your head.

1433
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,320
Do not think this is done.

1434
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,680
PLAYER: We are getting tired now.

1435
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:05,800
ALEX: Blast them away.

1436
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,040
There is more to come.

1437
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,520
More to come for you guys

1438
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,520
in the next 20 minutes.

1439
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,560
ALL: 3, 2, 1, Steelers!

1440
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,560
EAMMON: The Convicts score.

1441
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,640
And they score again.

1442
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,240
Our boys play their hearts out.

1443
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,320
But it's not enough.

1444
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,600
Full time.

1445
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,320
And the Kings Cross Steelers

1446
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:53,360
are knocked out of the Bingham Cup.

1447
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,000
EAMMON: are you proud
of what you've done

1448
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,040
for the club?

1449
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:56,880
NIC: No.

1450
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:57,880
I think

1451
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,320
I would have liked to have given them

1452
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,280
the Binghma Cup as the final hurrah.

1453
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,960
They deserved that.

1454
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,520
The boys deserved that

1455
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,400
the amount of work they put in.

1456
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,640
And you know, I feel

1457
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,480
really connected to the boys

1458
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,240
to the team, to the squad

1459
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,040
as individuals.

1460
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,880
And I felt

1461
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,240
that they deserved that place

1462
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,480
in that final.

1463
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,320
And in terms of their ability

1464
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,720
they were in that game.

1465
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,320
That game was for winning.

1466
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,440
PLAYER: The game is done.

1467
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,200
There is nothing that we can do

1468
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,320
to fix anything.

1469
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,840
So now is not the time for recriminations.

1470
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:40,960
What the moment is now

1471
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:43,120
is for the fucking pride we should take

1472
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:44,600
in the performance that we put in.

1473
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,960
Not just today, but on the first day

1474
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:47,960
and on the second day.

1475
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,120
And for the whole of the fucking season.

1476
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,400
The work rate

1477
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,720
the effort you boys put in for me today

1478
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:55,120
was fucking outstanding.

1479
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,080
You hold your heads high.

1480
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,800
You can have your fucking cry

1481
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,480
when you have your cry.

1482
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,200
But for the next fucking day,

1483
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,720
I want your heads held high.

1484
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,520
Be proud of the good things

1485
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,560
that you've done on this tour.

1486
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,840
You remember those fucking good things.

1487
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,800
We said we'd slap each other on the back

1488
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,840
for the good things that we've done.

1489
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,520
Make sure you go to somebody,

1490
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,000
anybody and say

1491
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,880
one fucking good thing, guys.

1492
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,440
SIMON: I definitely did myself proud

1493
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,800
and also I'll learn from some of the things

1494
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,560
that I could do better.

1495
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,520
So it's great.

1496
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:39,360
And I'm going home and my dad's

1497
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,920
going to be at the hospital
in a couple of days

1498
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,240
and my sister's got a baby.

1499
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,920
And we got to the semi-final

1500
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,240
of the Bingham Cup.

1501
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,160
Finish with that yeah?

1502
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,920
EAMMON: You did the club proud, mate.

1503
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,560
You had an undefeated season

1504
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,960
and you're top four in Bingham.

1505
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,320
I think you did the club

1506
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:16,720
bloody proud.

1507
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:19,360
ROB: Yeah. I hope this year goes down

1508
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,360
in a bit of Steelers history.

1509
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,160
NIC: I think it's really selfish

1510
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:27,120
because for me it's my ending.

1511
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:31,040
And I wanted that fairy tale princess ending.

1512
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,120
EAMMON: It's a bit selfish, too,

1513
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,880
because I wanted that same

1514
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,880
fairy tale ending for this documentary.

1515
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,280
I wanted it to be our boys on that podium.

1516
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,400
But actually, if you think about it

1517
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,880
that's not how life goes.

1518
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,680
More often than not, it doesn't turn out

1519
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,080
how you want.

1520
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,560
But that's where the opportunity lies.

1521
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,920
Three weeks ago, I got a concussion

1522
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,240
that ruled me out from playing

1523
01:13:58,240 --> 01:13:59,600
in this competition

1524
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,120
and I was devastated.

1525
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,480
But then I never would have

1526
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,000
picked up this camera

1527
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,760
filmed from the sidelines

1528
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,440
and this story would have never been told.

1529
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:09,480
If I didn't get bullied as a kid,

1530
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,920
well, maybe I wouldn't have

1531
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,640
a fighting spirit.

1532
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,000
If I didn't pick up that rugby ball

1533
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,760
when I was 12 years old

1534
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,720
even though I hated sport

1535
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:18,840
well, then I never would have

1536
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:19,800
joined the Steelers.

1537
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,040
I wouldn't have met my
incredible husband, John,

1538
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,360
and got married.

1539
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:24,480
Something I never thought

1540
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,040
would happen to me.

1541
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:30,080
And if that very first gay rugby team

1542
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,120
25 years ago simply gave up

1543
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,360
when the majority of straight teams

1544
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,920
refused to play them ...

1545
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,520
then who knows how many

1546
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,160
thousands of gay lives would be less rich

1547
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:41,600
because of it?

1548
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,280
NIC: I hope that some of them

1549
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,200
will feel that I have

1550
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:47,800
changed them as a coach.

1551
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:50,160
That I've moved them on

1552
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,880
and some of them maybe that's a nudge.

1553
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,280
Some of them maybe they feel like

1554
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,600
that's big steps.

1555
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,280
But I hope

1556
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,160
that the majority of my players feel that

1557
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,800
I've made them

1558
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,000
a better person.

1559
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,400
DREW: I don't fit in any one cup or mold.

1560
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,920
To me, that's just a B.S.

1561
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:14,080
kind of attitude to have

1562
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,520
that we as gay men have to

1563
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,880
fit this kind of category

1564
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,720
this mold that

1565
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,840
if you're a bear you have to be

1566
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,720
big and brawny and blah, blah, blah.

1567
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:25,960
If you're a twink, you have to be

1568
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,200
really flamboyant.

1569
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,400
Whoever you are,

1570
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,880
whatever type of person you are,

1571
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,400
that's you.

1572
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,760
That's being your authentic self.

1573
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,920
SIMON: I'll never forget
this rugby season.

1574
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,120
And just when I was about to

1575
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,680
walk away from rugby

1576
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:41,440
but something told me

1577
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,440
no, rugby can still help you.

1578
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,240
Then the club, and this season

1579
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:49,840
saved my life ...

1580
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,840
probably saved my life.

1581
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,800
And that's not ...

1582
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,280
I don't say that ...

1583
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,920
without careful thought.

1584
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:10,720
EAMMON: So for me

1585
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,920
this isn't a coming out story

1586
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,400
or a story about winning a tournament

1587
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,640
or even about being gay.

1588
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,360
It's a story about

1589
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:21,760
searching for where you belong

1590
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,680
and never giving up

1591
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,000
because you just might find happiness

1592
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,400
where you least expect.
