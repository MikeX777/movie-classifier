A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM

2
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,663
Please come in.

3
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,572
How about upstairs?

4
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,742
It's clean and spacious.

5
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,160
Come.

6
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,930
That's just the cellar.

7
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,442
This will do.

8
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,753
Did you bring what I asked for?

9
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,698
Shit!

10
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,033
Shit!

11
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,160
Superstitious nonsense!

12
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,120
Shit!

13
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:23,091
I believe now.

14
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,636
I'm your servant.

15
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,979
Remember, Lesmana.

16
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,399
He has accepted your oath.

17
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,152
Go home!

18
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,697
There's more wealth waiting for you.

29
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:59,372

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,973
HITTING SUDDEN BANKRUPTCY,
LESMANA CORPORATION TO SELL ASSETS

32
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,229
Excuse me.

33
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,408
Yes, it's Alfie.

34
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,330
Hospital?

35
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,048
24 HOURS

36
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,487
Alfie?

37
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,203
Alfie.

38
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,293
They called you, too?

39
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,004
-He's there, isn't he?
-Alfie.

40
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,465
Don't be emotional.

41
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,217
We need to fix things eventually, right?

42
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,307
After everything that has happened,

43
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,436
I never thought of you as an enemy.

44
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,656
Relationship with patient?

45
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,992
We are his children.
She's his biological daughter.

46
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,078
Mr. Lesmana is unresponsive,
but you may speak to him.

47
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,290
Being around familiar people
might help his motoric response.

48
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,210
What's wrong with him?

49
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,419
We have no clue yet.

50
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,714
He's showing stroke symptoms,
skin disease,

51
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,009
and failing organs.

52
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,512
Mrs. Laksmi isn't with you?

53
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,263
Yes. Our mom's not coming.

54
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,765
How come?

55
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,391
She just doesn't want to.

56
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,062
Very well, miss. Excuse me.

57
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,466
It's been ten years, right?

58
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,219
Since you last saw Dad?

59
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,306
A year ago, he started visiting his villa.

60
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,684
Back and forth.

61
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,144
Isolating himself.

62
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,146
Not long after his bankruptcy, right?

63
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,692
Alfie, this isn't easy for us.

64
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,029
Your issues with Dad
has nothing to do with me or Ruben.

65
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,868
No one wants to be alone
in this condition.

66
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,372
Ruben. Take Lily out.

67
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,207
We don't need her to start puking.

68
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,888
Mom plans to find any remaining assets
over at the villa.

69
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,894
Assets?

70
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,021
Have you visited that place?

71
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,030
The villa's ownership is under your name.

72
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,295
It's up to you, guys.

73
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,256
All right.

74
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,800
I'm going to call my mom.

75
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,491
I thought I'd feel satisfied
seeing you suffer like this.

76
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,379
You left us both.

77
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:10,594
Meanwhile, you were successful
and married that damn woman.

78
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,058
I should be really hating you right now.

79
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,023
But look at you now.

80
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,069
What is there to hate?

81
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,073
What is there left to hate, Dad?

82
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,541
Alfie!

83
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,296
Alfie?

84
00:18:59,012 --> 00:18:59,847
Ruben!

85
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,140
Lily.

86
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,224
Lily!

87
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,101
-Lily!
-Let me go!

88
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,111
Alfie.

89
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,280
It's been a while.

90
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,041
Be strong, child.

91
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,607
Goodness, what a mess.

92
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,902
How are we going to sell this
with a high price?

93
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,363
How long are we staying here, Mom?

94
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:57,949
Nara.

95
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,536
Ruben dear, where's your little sister?

96
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,372
Find her. Don't let her wander alone.

97
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,416
Nara.

98
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,127
-If there's nothing valuable here,
-Nara.

99
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,047
we'll head back to Jakarta tonight.
Okay, dear?

100
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,048
Yes, Mom.

101
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:13,965
Nara?

102
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,634
Nara?

103
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,388
Better sell fast before this dump
becomes a dead asset.

104
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,933
Who will buy this old dump, Mom?
It's very antique.

105
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,270
Besides, you should be asking Alfie.

106
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,745
Nara.

107
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,246
Sit down.

108
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,041
Don't be naughty.

109
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,634
Alfie.

110
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,930
What an unusual visit.

111
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,473
I'm just looking around.

112
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,228
Well, you know,

113
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:12,107
your father is really sick.

114
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,402
Obviously, the medical bills...

115
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,278
Are not cheap.

116
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,157
I know.

117
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,204
Has the hospital explained his condition?

118
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,546
Whatever it is,

119
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:39,843
let's just pray that God will protect him

120
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,303
and enlighten his path.

121
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,265
So you're selling this house, yeah?

122
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,936
Don't you guys have savings?

123
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:55,233
Alfie, you seem tired.
Why don't you rest a bit?

124
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,947
It must be hard for him.

125
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,367
Rich, but still not enough
to provide for an actress.

126
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:11,499
I meant a former actress.

127
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,127
Watch your mouth.

128
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,838
Who do you think you're talking to?

129
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,050
Who?

130
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:22,927
Her?

131
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,679
She's not my mother.

132
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,223
My mom was with Lesmana
even when he had nothing.

133
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,059
-My mom was faithful.
-Alfie.

134
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,355
Funny, isn't it?

135
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,609
All that, and she was still betrayed.

136
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,819
For who? For...

137
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:41,946
For you!

138
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,531
-Mom!
-You little demon!

139
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,670
What's wrong with you?

140
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,839
Can you just chill?

141
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,841
I'm going nuts here.

142
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,301
Sit down, Ruben.

143
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,260
Sit!

144
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:13,686
All of you, get ready
to find any documents,

145
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,105
anything we can take back with us.

146
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,498
It's me, Ruben.

147
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,547
Come in.

148
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,600
Eat, Alfie.

149
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,019
You haven't eaten, right?

150
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,734
I didn't poison it.

151
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,821
Isn't that your sister's snack?

152
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,532
Yes, I made Nara's snack.

153
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,742
I'm the only cook in the family.

154
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,293
See? Your stomach can't lie.

155
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,799
Well, let me dig in.

156
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,010
I'm starving.

157
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,154
You're kind of dorky, aren't you?

158
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,574
Is it my hair?

159
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,493
I haven't showered all day.

160
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,579
I was the one who drove here, too.

161
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,539
That's not what I meant.

162
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:58,958
Your personality.

163
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:01,878
You act like a dork.

164
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,631
I see.

165
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,591
You meant funny, right?

166
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,969
Funny stepbrothers do exist.

167
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:14,265
Actually, they are funny.
Have you heard of evil stepbrothers?

168
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,143
So lame.

169
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,731
I'm always wrong.

170
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,654
You're better than them, though.

171
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,406
Well, that's my mom.

172
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,829
Maya isn't usually cynical like that.

173
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,623
But...

174
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:43,336
since we've had money troubles,
she has become...

175
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,130
insecure and fearful.

176
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,592
That's how she is.

177
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,844
Please cut her some slack.

178
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,601
Maya is right, though.

179
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,398
I really want us to get along.

180
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,108
Have a good relationship.

181
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,703
Ruben.

182
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,663
Ruben.

183
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,124
Ruben.

184
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,421
Eat up.

185
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,076
Go on.

186
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,665
What's up?

187
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,751
What is she up to?

188
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:05,835
Crying?

189
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,003
Oh, please.

190
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,341
Take this.

191
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,926
What's this for?

192
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,929
That door there is closed shut.

193
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,390
Try pulling out those nails.

194
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,435
Why me?

195
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,313
You’re the strongest here.

196
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,191
Here, go straight to it.

197
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,323
Maya?

198
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,506
All good now?

199
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,381
24 HOURS

200
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,020
What is this?

201
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,192
Ruben, go check it out.

202
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,736
Go on.

203
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,531
I think we should check it tomorrow.

204
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:12,284
Ruben, we're going home tonight.

205
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,452
Go check downstairs.

206
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,830
There may be a safe-deposit box
or other valuables.

207
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,123
Now.

208
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,207
Go on, Ruben.

209
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,667
-Go on.
-Okay.

210
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,715
Ruben, don't do it!

211
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,344
Something's wrong with this place.

212
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,138
There's something upstairs!

213
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,890
You again.

214
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,726
-If you don't want to help, then--
-Listen!

215
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:42,106
There's something upstairs,
pictures we need to investigate.

216
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:43,774
-Mom.
-Something?

217
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,318
What pictures? You're still lying.

218
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,028
-You damn orphan!
-Mom!

219
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,321
What did you say?

220
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,158
Ruben, don't stick your nose
where it doesn't belong!

221
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,118
-Mom.
-Even your father abandoned you.

222
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,536
-Mom.
-You're all alone now!

223
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,662
Ungrateful brat!

224
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:57,705
Mom, enough.

225
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,957
-Mom.
-I really am tired with this brat.

226
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,376
-Mom!
-You should defend your mom.

227
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,294
What?

228
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,602
-Mom!
-Mom!

229
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,154
Mom!

230
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,948
-Ruben!
-Help!

231
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,867
Ruben!

232
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,039
Give me a hand!

233
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,676
Help me!

234
00:41:58,807 --> 00:41:59,725
Mom!

235
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,522
-Mom!
-Mom!

236
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,148
-Maya!
-Maya, don't!

237
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,691
-Fuck off!
-Maya!

238
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,193
-Ruben, Mom...
-Maya!

239
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,736
We don't know what's down there!

240
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,404
Ruben! It's Mom!

241
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,240
Mom!

242
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,371
Mom!

243
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,122
Mom!

244
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,917
Ruben, what should we do?

245
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:38,806
Ruben.

246
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:00,869
Mom...

247
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,212
Ruben, step back.

248
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,263
Mom?

249
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:26,807
Fortune shall be paid with souls.

250
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:44,908
Mom!

251
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,452
Maya!

252
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,693
This will have to do for now.

253
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,328
What is that, Nara?

254
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,415
It was outside--

255
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,667
Throw it away, Nara!

256
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,335
It's filthy!

257
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,304
Give me the doll.

258
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:31,932
Alfie.

259
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:33,725
Come with me.

260
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,391
We're stuck here.

261
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,144
What is wrong with my mom?

262
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:31,742
Ruben!

263
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,751
Your phone's dead, right?

264
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:48,091
Try calling the police, local district,
or anyone who could help us.

265
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,135
You sure about this?

266
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,763
Your sister's not well.

267
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,266
That wound could be infected.

268
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,771
There's a village down the path.

269
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,856
She can be treated there.

270
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:07,736
In this situation,
it's safer for all of us to go.

271
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,238
What about Nara?

272
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:12,866
Ruben.

273
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,952
Remember who's lurking out there.

274
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:25,879
Just in case.

275
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:28,298
You're the tough one.

276
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,677
But please, don't act rashly.

277
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,156
Alfie.

278
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:56,702
Alfie.

279
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,497
What is it?

280
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,669
You hate me, don't you?

281
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,091
I don't hate you, Maya.

282
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:15,011
I don’t want you to hate me.

283
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,516
My life isn't exactly a joyride.

284
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,228
I'm not even close to your father.

285
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:26,940
And my mom...

286
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:31,528
Yeah, she isn't exactly a good mother.

287
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,241
Now, she's possessed.

288
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,663
Maya, we have to keep on moving. Come on.

289
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,248
Maya!

290
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,545
What's that?

291
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:03,643
Mom!

292
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,228
Mom!

293
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,145
What is this?

294
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,149
Maya, that's...

295
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,693
Maya.

296
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:39,155
Alfie, have you been stalking us?

297
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,908
No, Maya, not at all!

298
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,286
Why did you bring me here?

299
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:46,079
Maya, you need to be treated.

300
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:48,915
Why, Alfie?

301
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,668
Please hear me out, Maya!

302
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:57,382
Maya!

303
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:02,846
Maya!

304
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,025
Maya.

305
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,236
Maya!

306
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,705
Maya!

307
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:38,965
Police...

308
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,426
Police hotline...

309
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:10,163
Honey, where are you?
Why didn't you tell me?

310
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:13,249
You promised to be with me.
I'm still upset

311
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,168
-your father puked on me.
-Honey, I...

312
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,837
What? If you really want to be with me,

313
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:21,216
-you should be more mature.
-Honey, please listen to me.

314
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:22,968
Your mother hates me, Ben.

315
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,887
So does Maya.

316
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:27,973
-You really are--
-My mom's possessed!

317
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,433
What? How come?

318
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,353
-No, I mean...
-What?

319
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,980
-My head hurts.
-Honey, be serious!

320
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,856
-I really want you here.
-Don't talk like that!

321
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,483
Please come here. I'm really tired.

322
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:41,778
Let's leave together.
I'll send you my location, okay?

323
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:45,532
Where are you now? I'm going there.
Send your loc--

324
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,634
Brother.

325
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:11,599
I saw the person who took Mom.

326
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,186
Where?

327
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,690
In that scary room.

328
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,447
We're safe in this room.

329
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:37,917
Ruben.

330
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,866
How did you turn into this?

331
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:26,716
I needed to hold on to something.

332
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,431
Even if it reminded me
of everything I hate.

333
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:38,103
But that's all I have, Ruben.

334
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,146
That's it.

335
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,608
So you hate me?

336
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:45,860
Maya?

337
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:49,614
Nara?

338
00:56:57,872 --> 00:57:00,291
The person I hate the most is myself.

339
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,087
In this world, I hate myself the most.

340
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,091
Then how about Maya?

341
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:12,178
Do we just leave her out there?

342
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:34,159
Ruben, look at me.

343
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:44,169
As soon the sun rises,
we'll look for Maya.

344
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,005
We will not leave her.

345
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:49,757
Trust me.

346
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,307
Now what?

347
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,060
There's something
you need to see downstairs.

348
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:21,873
SORRY

349
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,138
Turns out Lesmana is not a good person.

350
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:49,609
I saw this woman at the hospital, Ruben.

351
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:10,672
He stuck these symbols on that door
leading to downstairs.

352
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,300
Is it possible...

353
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,720
he was trying to keep something there?

354
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:42,453
Ruben.

355
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:51,588
"Dark priestesses.

356
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:57,176
Usually, these women
have dedicated themselves

357
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,805
to be the concubines of the Devil...

358
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,143
until doomsday comes.

359
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:11,107
Therefore, they are given the power
to do supernatural things."

360
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,782
Why would Lesmana mess around
with this stuff?

361
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:25,747
Think of it.

362
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:28,499
Lesmana.

363
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,461
All of a sudden, he became rich.

364
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:37,425
Then he went bankrupt a few years later.

365
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,345
Then he started coming back here.

366
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,351
What does it have to do with your mom?

367
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,646
And now my mom's also in deep shit.

368
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:55,443
Alfie, what if that woman is still lurking
in the basement?

369
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,655
Alfie. Alfie?

370
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,157
Alfie.

371
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,039
Mom!

372
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:51,791
Mom!

373
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,304
Mom!

374
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,296
Mom?

375
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,290
Nara.

376
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,502
Nara.

377
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:03,130
Are you sleeping?

378
01:04:05,633 --> 01:04:08,094
Please accompany me, Nara.

379
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,473
I really love you.

380
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:17,353
I'm lonely, Nara.

381
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,398
It's dark in here.

382
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:23,317
I'm scared.

383
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,241
You damned demon!

384
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:31,153
Come here, Nara. You should wake up.

385
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:35,992
Wake up and stay with me!

386
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:38,786
Wake up!

387
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:43,290
I'm alone here! Accompany me!

388
01:06:43,374 --> 01:06:44,959
Come on!

389
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:47,628
You're not my mom!

390
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:26,500
Nara!

391
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:41,390
Ruben!

392
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:35,861
Alfie.

393
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:37,905
Sweetheart.

394
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:43,786
Hold on, dear.

395
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:46,539
Mom will be right back.

396
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,477
Mom!

397
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:10,020
Mom!

398
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:11,939
Mom!

399
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:14,608
Mom!

400
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,569
Let go!

401
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:18,737
Mom!

402
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:27,913
Mom!

403
01:09:56,233 --> 01:09:59,612
Hi, it's Ruben.
I can't talk right now. Leave a message.

404
01:10:06,243 --> 01:10:07,161
Maya?

405
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:09,997
What happened to you?

406
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,208
What are you doing here?

407
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:15,377
Just helping out.

408
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:17,713
You want to meet Ruben, right?

409
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:24,136
Yes, he told me to come.

410
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:27,932
What did he say?

411
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:32,311
Open the door.

412
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,205
You can go first, Maya.

413
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:53,540
I'll be behind you.

414
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:59,380
Let's go together. It's not that far.

415
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:04,343
Maya.

416
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:08,347
Why are you holding a hammer?

417
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:15,980
I'll just stay here.

418
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,026
What did you say?

419
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:25,739
Unlock the door, Lily.

420
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,033
If you don't believe me,

421
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:31,203
talk to Ruben.

422
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:32,788
Here.

423
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:35,225
Nara.

424
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:51,570
Maya.

425
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:01,997
Maya.

426
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,293
Who are you?

427
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:10,881
I'm your mother.

428
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:13,926
Mom?

429
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,971
Mom, forgive me.

430
01:15:18,722 --> 01:15:19,932
My child.

431
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:23,185
I'm inside her now.

432
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:25,646
I didn't mean to.

433
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:29,733
This is not my fault, Mom.

434
01:15:30,609 --> 01:15:33,737
-Your brother and sister chose me, Maya.
-Your brother and sister chose me, Maya.

435
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,325
-Maya.
-Maya.

436
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,995
-You're scared, aren't you?
-You're scared, aren't you?

437
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:47,834
It's all her fault.

438
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:51,630
It's your fault!

439
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:55,133
You're tearing my family apart on purpose.

440
01:15:57,177 --> 01:15:58,762
It's all your fucking fault!

441
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:01,473
Maya.

442
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:05,310
-Would you like to be my follower?
-Would you like to be my follower?

443
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:10,607
Be my lambkin.

444
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:15,362
Kneel before me.

445
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,321
I know this isn't real.

446
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:47,537
But you need to know, Mom...

447
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:52,334
I want to be with you again.

448
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:08,058
Stay with me, Alfie.

449
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:10,811
It's so dark in here.

450
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:16,566
I'm so alone and scared.

451
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:28,995
It should've been you.

452
01:18:30,122 --> 01:18:32,624
You should've been taken, Alfie.

453
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:45,262
Are you letting me go again, Alfie?

454
01:18:47,597 --> 01:18:49,307
You want to be like your daddy?

455
01:18:58,442 --> 01:19:00,110
Don't you get it?

456
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:13,123
I'm lonely!

457
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:14,708
You're not my mom!

458
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:36,146
Alfie.

459
01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:39,900
Alfie, what's wrong?

460
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:41,485
Alfie.

461
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:43,612
Calm down.

462
01:19:50,827 --> 01:19:51,661
Why?

463
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:53,580
I like this dress.

464
01:19:55,874 --> 01:19:58,919
I found it upstairs. It suits me, right?

465
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:01,838
Maya, why are you... When did you--

466
01:20:03,465 --> 01:20:05,008
Soon, Alfie.

467
01:20:05,342 --> 01:20:06,259
Alfie?

468
01:20:06,676 --> 01:20:07,761
Alfie, what's wrong?

469
01:20:35,413 --> 01:20:36,289
Ruben.

470
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,168
-Ruben!
-What?

471
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:42,629
We have to leave now.

472
01:20:44,297 --> 01:20:47,384
I called Lily. She's coming, all right?

473
01:20:48,468 --> 01:20:50,595
We can't go
because Mom is still out there.

474
01:20:56,142 --> 01:20:58,854
Look at my arm. Look!

475
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,901
Look at Nara's!

476
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:12,075
Remember what your mom said last night.

477
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:14,995
"Fortune shall be paid with souls."

478
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:22,836
That woman we saw last night,

479
01:21:22,919 --> 01:21:24,796
she came and took my mom.

480
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,840
Now she's in your mom!

481
01:21:29,509 --> 01:21:31,928
She'll never let go of me and Nara.

482
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:36,600
And I don't know
what will happen to you all.

483
01:21:41,771 --> 01:21:43,273
We should go, Ruben.

484
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:47,444
Let's just fucking leave!

485
01:21:47,527 --> 01:21:48,778
It's time!

486
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,282
He will never let you leave.

487
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:56,369
He will never let you leave.

488
01:21:57,662 --> 01:22:00,624
What do you mean?
Who are you talking about, Maya?

489
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,791
Who is he?

490
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:03,168
Say his name!

491
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:04,586
-Say it.
-Who?

492
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:07,213
-Say it!
-Who, Maya?

493
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:09,549
-Say his name! Say it!
-Who, Maya?

494
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:19,559
Say it!

495
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:03,353
Maya?

496
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:05,939
What are you doing there?

497
01:23:06,439 --> 01:23:09,192
He will never let us leave.

498
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:38,888
Maya!

499
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:43,476
Alfie! I got to find Maya.

500
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,020
No, Ruben, don't!

501
01:23:45,311 --> 01:23:47,147
-Don't!
-Watch over Nara.

502
01:23:48,773 --> 01:23:50,942
Ruben!

503
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:01,536
Maya!

504
01:24:02,454 --> 01:24:04,372
Maya, we need to leave.

505
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,882
Maya, what are you doing here?

506
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:15,383
Maya.

507
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,600
He wants Alfie and Nara, Ruben.

508
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:11,648
Maya?

509
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:16,194
Please tell me you're Maya.

510
01:25:22,742 --> 01:25:24,077
Who do you think this is?

511
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:27,580
Wake up, Maya.

512
01:25:35,171 --> 01:25:36,589
I told you.

513
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,219
We will never leave this house.

514
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:45,640
I've killed Mom.

515
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:56,109
Lily, too.

516
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:58,778
In the woods.

517
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:03,283
What did you say?

518
01:26:03,366 --> 01:26:05,952
Ruben, calm down.

519
01:26:07,787 --> 01:26:08,746
Calm down.

520
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:13,459
Mom is already beneath his feet.

521
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:16,546
Look.

522
01:26:18,673 --> 01:26:20,133
He's there.

523
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,094
My daughter.

524
01:26:25,221 --> 01:26:29,058
He's waiting for me, for you,

525
01:26:29,726 --> 01:26:31,644
to be back in his embrace.

526
01:26:31,728 --> 01:26:32,937
Who is he?

527
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:48,620
Now, let's take Alfie and Nara to him.

528
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:53,541
You and I...

529
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:59,297
we will never need to ask
for anything else.

530
01:27:04,469 --> 01:27:05,553
Are you crazy?

531
01:27:06,804 --> 01:27:09,724
This is our chance
to repay Lesmana's debts.

532
01:27:11,351 --> 01:27:13,728
Alfie and Nara.

533
01:27:15,521 --> 01:27:18,024
-And still, you reject him.
-Maya! Wake up!

534
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,945
You're blind to his greatness.
You're blind to--

535
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:28,201
Sorry.

536
01:27:45,134 --> 01:27:47,095
Maya!

537
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:55,812
Maya!

538
01:28:00,566 --> 01:28:01,442
Ruben!

539
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,281
Ruben.

540
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:18,209
Ruben!

541
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:30,847
Ruben!

542
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:42,066
-Ruben!
-No!

543
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:42,984
Don't come here.

544
01:28:44,277 --> 01:28:45,653
Go!

545
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:49,949
Go!

546
01:28:53,077 --> 01:28:54,203
Go now!

547
01:29:27,945 --> 01:29:29,447
Maya!

548
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:44,962
Brother!

549
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:45,963
Nara!

550
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:49,425
Nara!

551
01:30:25,419 --> 01:30:27,004
I have been waiting for you.

552
01:30:46,732 --> 01:30:48,484
Did you bring what is needed?

553
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:51,654
I can't.

554
01:30:53,447 --> 01:30:55,241
Alfie's my daughter.

555
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:57,910
But you could do it to your first wife.

556
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:04,500
Lesmana, you didn't make a promise to me.

557
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:10,965
Until now, you have not been able
to pay your dues.

558
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:41,579
You take me for a fool, Lesmana?

559
01:32:33,714 --> 01:32:35,216
Lesmana!

560
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:41,722
Not now, not later,

561
01:32:43,015 --> 01:32:45,643
but when you least expect it,

562
01:32:47,019 --> 01:32:49,689
you will lose everything!

563
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:54,777
Along with your own flesh and blood!

564
01:32:56,612 --> 01:33:00,241
Be ready to be taken, Lesmana!

565
01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:49,123
Maya.

566
01:33:53,002 --> 01:33:54,795
Maya is one with me.

567
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:03,637
She's laughing at you, my child.

568
01:34:08,225 --> 01:34:11,520
Your defiance is useless.

569
01:34:18,861 --> 01:34:20,696
Nara is your sister, Maya!

570
01:34:24,116 --> 01:34:26,118
Ruben was your brother!

571
01:35:10,037 --> 01:35:12,832
Please come to your senses, Maya.

572
01:35:12,915 --> 01:35:16,627
It's me, Alfie!

573
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:18,546
It's all useless now, my child.

574
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:21,966
Maya has already accepted who she is.

575
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:26,137
After I have taken her.

576
01:35:29,306 --> 01:35:32,810
I know you still love Nara, Maya!

577
01:35:33,602 --> 01:35:34,895
I know it!

578
01:35:39,608 --> 01:35:40,609
Alfie.

579
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:48,576
Honestly,

580
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:53,581
I never really liked you.

581
01:36:57,728 --> 01:36:58,854
What's so funny?

582
01:37:08,948 --> 01:37:10,115
You're funny.

583
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:14,620
Even now, you're still acting.

584
01:37:21,585 --> 01:37:22,795
What do you mean?

585
01:37:30,469 --> 01:37:31,804
"What do you mean?"

586
01:37:37,226 --> 01:37:40,437
You know what Ruben said about you?

587
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:47,611
What?

588
01:37:53,367 --> 01:37:54,577
He told me

589
01:37:56,787 --> 01:38:01,625
that you are insecure and fearful.

590
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:04,712
"Please cut her some slack."

591
01:38:39,788 --> 01:38:44,126
It seems like you won't need your legs
in the place where you're going.

592
01:38:59,683 --> 01:39:00,726
You go first.

593
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:26,645
Nara!

594
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:50,177
Alfie.

595
01:45:54,556 --> 01:45:55,474
Alfie.

596
01:46:01,396 --> 01:46:02,355
Alfie.

597
01:46:05,317 --> 01:46:06,193
Mom...

598
01:46:07,194 --> 01:46:08,111
Mom.

599
01:50:21,698 --> 01:50:23,700
