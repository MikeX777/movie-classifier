1
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,065
A survey was taken
a few years ago that asked

2
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:49,365
three hundred professionals
one question.

3
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:51,934
"What's the worst thing
that can happen in sports?"

4
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:57,633
Some people answered,
losing at game seven.

5
00:00:57,635 --> 00:01:02,399
He scores,
Bruins win in seven games!

6
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:04,599
And other people
said getting swept in 4.

7
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,965
Some people said it was
missing the World Cup.

8
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:11,366
Guatemala is eliminated!

9
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:13,498
Goal!

10
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,465
And some Brazilian said
it was losing to Argentina.

11
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:21,199
Not just in the World Cup.
Any time, ever, in any contest.

12
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:23,166
But one person answered
that the worst thing

13
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:27,231
that can happen in sports is
fourth place at the Olympics.

14
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:29,265
This is a true story,
but except for my own

15
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:31,266
I've changed all the names
and I've done my best

16
00:01:31,268 --> 00:01:34,998
to obscure identities for
reasons that'll become clear.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,266
I'm Molly Bloom.

18
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:38,465
And right now, I'm ranked third
in North America

19
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:39,965
in Woman's Moguls.

20
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,499
I grew up
in Loveland, Colorado

21
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,998
about two hours
north of Denver.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,698
I have a B.A.
in Political Science

23
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,132
from the University
of Colorado

24
00:01:46,134 --> 00:01:48,166
where I graduated
Summa Cum Laude

25
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:50,298
with a 3.9 GPA.

26
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,132
The median L-Sat score
at Harvard Law School is 169.

27
00:01:54,134 --> 00:01:55,665
My score is 173.

28
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:58,065
Number 87, up!
Fifty six on deck!

29
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:00,199
I've spent 16 years
chasing winter

30
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:03,131
and being coached
by the best in the world.

31
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,832
Sundays were for working out
with my father.

32
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:06,633
Something's really wrong.

33
00:02:06,635 --> 00:02:07,665
When I was 12 years old

34
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:08,697
for no particular reason

35
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,065
my back exploded.

36
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:11,898
Tough it out.

37
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,098
- Good advice.
- And lose the attitude.

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,532
Less than 10
minutes later, I was in

39
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:17,731
the back of an ambulance.

40
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:19,999
I had what's called
rapid onset scoliosis.

41
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:22,031
My spine was curved
at 63 degrees

42
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:24,064
and I'd need a seven hour
surgical procedure

43
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:25,931
that involved
straightening my spine

44
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:27,365
extracting bone from my hip

45
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:28,932
fusing 11 vertebrae together

46
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:30,899
and fastening steel rods
to the fused segments.

47
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,999
- She's gonna be fine.
- Oh!

48
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:36,132
I wouldn't let her ski anymore,
definitely not Moguls.

49
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:38,465
And obviously
skiing competitively

50
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:39,867
is out of the question.

51
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,466
Oh, God, thank you.

52
00:02:43,468 --> 00:02:45,198
I was on skis again in a year.

53
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,632
Running Moguls in 18 months

54
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:47,865
and by my 20th birthday

55
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,232
I made the U.S. Ski Team.

56
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:50,764
It's the last round
of qualifying

57
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:52,366
for the Salt Lake City
Olympics.

58
00:02:52,368 --> 00:02:54,331
This is the champion run
at Deer Valley.

59
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:55,798
The altitude is 8100 feet.

60
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,332
And the pitch is 52 degrees

61
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:59,865
which is the same as the sides
of the great pyramids.

62
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:03,099
The wind's 20 to 25 miles
an hour blowing left to right.

63
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:05,299
It's 3 below zero
at the top of the slope.

64
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:07,665
And with seventeen skiers
in front of me

65
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,232
it's gonna be like trying
to stick a landing

66
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:10,731
on a frozen infinity pool.

67
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,165
Kiki blew out of her line.

68
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:14,166
Shannon was off balance
on her second landing.

69
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:15,533
He's talking about Kiki Bandy

70
00:03:15,535 --> 00:03:16,599
and Shannon Keebler

71
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:17,998
my two toughest competitors

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,732
who had significant
point deductions

73
00:03:19,734 --> 00:03:21,697
on their final runs.

74
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:22,898
I can make the Olympic team.

75
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,764
- Right now.
- Go get it.

76
00:03:24,766 --> 00:03:26,499
And if I have three prefect
runs in Salt Lake

77
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:28,332
the best runs of my life

78
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:30,865
I can beat the Austrians
and the Swiss

79
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:32,898
and have a realistic shot
at the podium.

80
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,865
Then law school
and then a start up.

81
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:38,232
A foundation that seeds
entrepreneurial women.

82
00:03:38,234 --> 00:03:40,032
My father's
at the bottom of the slope

83
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:41,799
telepathically telling me
to check my line.

84
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:44,932
- Check your line.
- I check my line.

85
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:46,601
Ready?

86
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:53,331
Good snow contact.
Calm upper body.

87
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,965
Legs together. Good shape.
No line deviation.

88
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:58,135
Set up for the D-Spin and...

89
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:01,631
stick the landing.

90
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:02,832
Now, two things you need
to know

91
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:04,064
before the second trick

92
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:05,498
which will be a 720.

93
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,131
The first is that
when visibility is bad

94
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,832
the way it is now,
race officials toss pine boughs

95
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:11,631
on the course
so the skiers have some

96
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:13,266
foreground depth reference.

97
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:15,332
The second is that
the tightness of your bindings

98
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:17,431
is determined by what's
called a DIN setting.

99
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:20,031
If you're a beginner, your DIN
setting is probably a 2 or 3.

100
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:21,998
If you're an experienced
weekend skier

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,198
it's probably seven or eight.
Mine's fifteen.

102
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,332
My boots are basically welded
to my skis, right?

103
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,698
So how does this happen?

104
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,498
It happened
because I hit a pine bough

105
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,598
that had become frozen
in the snow.

106
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,366
And I hit it so precisely

107
00:04:36,368 --> 00:04:38,865
that it simply snapped
the release of my bindings.

108
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:40,331
Right in that moment
I didn't have time

109
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,031
to calculate the odds
of that happening

110
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,798
because I was about
to land pretty hard

111
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,765
on my digitally re-mastered
spinal cord

112
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:47,532
which was being held together
by spare parts

113
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:49,001
from an Erector Set.

114
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:57,435
- Give her room!
- Get out of the way! Move!

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,065
None of this has
anything to do with poker.

116
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:07,032
I'm only mentioning it
because I wanted to say to

117
00:05:07,034 --> 00:05:08,665
whoever answered that the worst
thing that could happen

118
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:11,298
in sports was 4th place
at the Olympics...

119
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,101
Seriously? Fuck you.

120
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,898
- Hello?
- Molly Bloom?

121
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,431
- Is this Molly Bloom?
- Yes.

122
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:13,799
This is Special
Agent Tomasino of the FBI.

123
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:15,697
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

124
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:16,965
- Sorry?
- We're outside your door.

125
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:19,498
We want you
to come out here. Okay?

126
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,965
Listen to me now. Make sure
we can see your hands.

127
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:22,831
Who is this?

128
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,531
This is Special Agent Tomasino

129
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:25,831
of the FBI, Miss Bloom.

130
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,231
You've got 30 seconds to open

131
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:28,998
your door
or we're breaking it down.

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,464
Do you understand
what I just said?

133
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,431
Hands in the air!

134
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,965
Put your hands in the air!

135
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:45,365
- There's been a mistake.
- Are you Molly Bloom?

136
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:49,764
I want you to walk toward me
very slowly. Okay? Go ahead.

137
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:52,400
- I'm...
- Slower. Slower. Slow down.

138
00:06:53,432 --> 00:06:55,032
Come on. Come on.

139
00:06:55,034 --> 00:06:57,664
I'm having a hard time seeing,
the, the flashlights in my eyes.

140
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:01,132
- Walk slower.
- Yes, sir.

141
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:04,664
Hands on the wall.
Spread your arms and legs.

142
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,497
Is there anyone
in your apartment right now?

143
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:07,865
Uh, no, sir.

144
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:09,331
Are there any firearms
in your apartment right now?

145
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,431
- No, sir.
- Go.

146
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:13,799
You're under arrest for running
an illegal gambling operation.

147
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,865
- Do you understand?
- Uh, yes.

148
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:17,832
Say you understand.

149
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:19,865
I understand, but
there's been a mistake.

150
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:21,397
Because I haven't
run a game in two years.

151
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,497
I want you to take a look at

152
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:24,064
this piece of paper right here.

153
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:25,734
Can you see what
it says at the top?

154
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:28,765
Yes.

155
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,464
Read to me
what it says at the top.

156
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:34,735
"United States of America
vs. Molly Bloom."

157
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:39,035
I bet heavy on the favorite.

158
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,064
Alright, what do you, um...

159
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:45,331
think about
the following concepts?

160
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,697
Just gonna run them by you.

161
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,799
- Marriage.
- It is a trap.

162
00:07:50,801 --> 00:07:53,800
- Society?
- It is a joke.

163
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,431
People.

164
00:07:57,433 --> 00:08:00,401
I... think there's good and bad.

165
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:03,834
But I don't trust them.

166
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:07,464
I don't trust people.

167
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:09,098
Every year on our
birthdays, my father would

168
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,199
interview my younger
brothers and me.

169
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:13,698
Who are the heroes
or heroines in your life?

170
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,531
Who, uh... who do you
really respect?

171
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:19,232
I don't have any heroes.

172
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:21,032
You don't have any heroes.

173
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,765
How's this for hubris?

174
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:24,899
I don't.

175
00:08:24,901 --> 00:08:27,998
Because if I reach the goals
I set out for myself

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,864
then the person I become,
that'll be my hero.

177
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:33,865
Even by teenage girl standards

178
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:35,731
I would appear
to be irrationally angry

179
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:37,397
at nothing in particular.

180
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,364
It would be another 22 years
before I'd find out why.

181
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:43,398
After my colossal wipe out
at Deer Valley

182
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,266
I decided to take a year off
before law school.

183
00:08:46,268 --> 00:08:48,731
I needed to go away,
sever myself from reality

184
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:50,764
and come up with a new plan.

185
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:52,799
So I chose Los Angeles.

186
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:54,465
A friend of mine
from the ski team

187
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,232
had agreed to let me crash
on her couch for a while.

188
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:59,697
My father had disapproved
of postponing law school

189
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:01,631
and so, declined to help out.

190
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:04,532
But I had $1700 dollars I'd
saved from babysitting money

191
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:08,398
and that would support me until
I found a waitressing job.

192
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,430
I'd already had a career
and retired from it.

193
00:09:11,432 --> 00:09:15,531
I wanted to be young
for a while in warm weather.

194
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:19,665
I think that's what I wanted at
first. It's hard to remember.

195
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:21,999
I got a job working
bottle service at a club

196
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:25,099
in Hollywood
called "Nacional Nightclub."

197
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:27,131
It was Cuban themed,
so my uniform

198
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,735
was camouflaged short-shorts
and a wife beater.

199
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:33,065
The promoter would go over
which record producer

200
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:35,765
was sitting where, which
hot designers, which Lakers

201
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:38,598
and Borislava the Bulgarian
billionaire, who didn't drink.

202
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,064
But he ran a $100,000 bar tab.

203
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:42,597
My job was
to get people to spend

204
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:44,397
more money than they needed to.

205
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,732
Could we get a bottle of Skyy?

206
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:47,099
You guys look like
you deserve Grey Goose.

207
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:49,665
What do guys who deserve
Grey Goose look like?

208
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:50,698
To begin with,
they've got a bottle

209
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,099
of Grey Goose in front of them.

210
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:54,199
You're quick. Very clever.

211
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:56,398
Uh, alright, yeah. Grey Goose.

212
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,665
They just spent an
additional $300 dollars

213
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,697
bringing their total
to $900 dollars

214
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:03,132
for $8 and 50 cents
worth of vodka.

215
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:05,031
But the club doesn't
need you to buy a bottle.

216
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,697
They need you
to buy five bottles.

217
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:08,198
So these girls over here

218
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,131
they let you buy them
shots for a living.

219
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:11,898
It would be like waiting
in a long line to get into

220
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,365
the Gap so you can pay
1000% percent mark-up

221
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:17,034
to buy all the employees
a pair of pants.

222
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:21,565
I only had one shift a week.
I didn't wanna tell my parents

223
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,064
I was a cocktail waitress and
back then, I never turned down

224
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:25,932
an opportunity
to make more money.

225
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:28,031
So I found a second job
as an office assistant.

226
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:30,664
And that's how I ended up
working for Dean Keith.

227
00:10:32,267 --> 00:10:35,098
Dean was a partner
in Black Hues Investments.

228
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,464
He was a regular at the club,
and one night he said...

229
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:38,935
People seem to take to you.

230
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,430
Hey, how would you like to
get paid to go to grad school

231
00:10:42,432 --> 00:10:44,164
and get an MBA
in how life works?

232
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,265
What makes you think
you know and I don't?

233
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:49,197
I'm a regular here
and you're a waitress here.

234
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:50,864
Look at the fuckin' scoreboard.

235
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:53,164
Dean explained what
my job was by saying...

236
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:56,132
Me. I'm your job.

237
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:58,899
I answered the phone, made
coffee runs, set appointments.

238
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:00,697
- Made spread sheets.
- What is that?

239
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:02,265
And showed Dean
what a spreadsheet was.

240
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:03,798
Spreadsheet.

241
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,898
But I made $450 dollars
a week on top

242
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,964
of the $300
I was making at the club.

243
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:11,065
Which would be enough
to get off my friend's couch.

244
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,498
I remember the day started
by being about bagels.

245
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,731
- This is Molly.
- Get to the office.

246
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:16,400
Pick up bagels.

247
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:20,297
Do you mean now?

248
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:22,832
Dean was a Hollywood staple.

249
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,665
Over leveraged. Going broke.

250
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,497
Trying to prove
he wasn't broke and making

251
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:29,464
a true effort to be
as vulgar as possible.

252
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:31,265
Honestly making an effort.

253
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:33,064
I hadn't told anyone
I was a skier

254
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:34,831
and it was hard not
to laugh when Dean said...

255
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,430
Anyone ever teach you
how to fuckin' hurry?

256
00:11:36,432 --> 00:11:38,898
- No.
- What are those?

257
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,464
Bagels.

258
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,865
- Are these from Blue Bell?
- Yeah.

259
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,032
- It's on the way from my house.
- Seriously?

260
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:47,364
You might as well have stopped
at a fuckin' homeless shelter!

261
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:48,632
You might as well
have walked into

262
00:11:48,634 --> 00:11:51,097
a mother fucking
homeless shelter and said

263
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:54,231
"I'd like a dozen bagels from
this homeless shelter, please."

264
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:58,764
I do not eat bagels
from Blue-fucking-Bell, Molly

265
00:11:58,766 --> 00:12:02,498
because these
are poor people bagels!

266
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,831
From where would you like me
to get your bagels...

267
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,365
Forget about the fuckin' bagels.

268
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:06,465
- Done.
- Except smarten up.

269
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:07,864
- Got it.
- Hang on.

270
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:09,430
Like I said, the day started

271
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:12,798
by being about bagels,
but that would abruptly change.

272
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,799
My weekly poker game
is moving to the Cobra Lounge.

273
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,764
Tomorrow night,
and then every Tuesday night.

274
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:17,898
You'll help run it.

275
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,430
Take these names and numbers.

276
00:12:19,432 --> 00:12:21,032
Tell them to bring
ten grand in cash

277
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:23,935
for the first buy-in.
The blinds are 51/100.

278
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,498
- And Molly.
- Yeah.

279
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,133
Don't fucking tell anybody.

280
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:38,865
I'd regarded Dean as a
nitwit when I regarded him at all.

281
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:41,799
But on that pad were nine names
along with phone numbers of

282
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:44,999
some of the wealthiest and most
famous people in the world.

283
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:48,130
I put the numbers in my phone
and composed a simple message.

284
00:12:48,132 --> 00:12:50,565
There'd be a game tomorrow
night at the Cobra Lounge.

285
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:52,468
There was
a $10,000 dollar buy-in.

286
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:57,100
All nine players confirmed
that they'd be there.

287
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:03,597
All within 90 seconds
of my sending the text.

288
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:06,998
The Cobra Lounge sits on
the edge of the Sunset Strip.

289
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,965
And in it's heyday was famous
for introducing unknown bands

290
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:13,030
like "The Doors"
and "The Beach Boys."

291
00:13:13,032 --> 00:13:15,565
All I knew was school work
and skiing.

292
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:17,164
I'd always figured
sophistication

293
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,165
would be easy to learn
if I ever needed it.

294
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,165
My cheese platter had
a sticker that read

295
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,732
"Cheese From the Great State
of Michigan."

296
00:13:24,734 --> 00:13:26,932
Diego, a professional dealer

297
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:29,831
was setting up the table
when I got there.

298
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,865
I Googled "What type of music

299
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:33,898
do poker players
like to listen to?"

300
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,698
and then tried to figure out
how to make a playlist

301
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,731
out of one Kenny Rogers song.

302
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,564
I set up the bar...

303
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:42,164
put out my cheese platter...

304
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,831
and positioned myself
at the door where I'd been

305
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,097
instructed to only let in

306
00:13:45,099 --> 00:13:46,697
the names on the list.

307
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:48,264
I was wearing my best dress,
which I had bought

308
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:51,731
two years earlier
at J.C. Penney for $88.

309
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:53,764
The players started to arrive.

310
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,231
I introduced myself as Molly,
Dean's assistant.

311
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,400
For you.

312
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,667
Asked if I could
get them a drink.

313
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:07,568
And took from each of them
$10,000 in cash.

314
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:12,264
- Hi.
- Hi.

315
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:13,433
I'm...

316
00:14:16,132 --> 00:14:17,364
I know.

317
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:19,430
- Your boss...
- Everybody here?

318
00:14:19,432 --> 00:14:20,764
- Yeah.
- Hey, buddy.

319
00:14:20,766 --> 00:14:22,601
Fuck off,
I'm gonna own your shit.

320
00:14:23,866 --> 00:14:26,330
Ugly dress.
Ugly shoes.

321
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,801
Let's play!

322
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:32,963
Diego fanned nine
cards out on the table

323
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:35,133
and the players
chose for seats.

324
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:46,498
Eleven and eleven...

325
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,698
He checked,
the action's on you.

326
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,330
I just finished
counting out $90,000 in cash.

327
00:14:52,332 --> 00:14:57,198
I was in a room
with movie stars, directors.

328
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,697
Rappers. Boxers.

329
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,668
- He's in trouble.
- And business titans.

330
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,798
They were going all in,
all the time.

331
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,532
Burning through their
buy-ins over and over.

332
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,897
- Here you go. Good luck
- Thank you so much.

333
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:13,231
I don't know.

334
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:16,430
I Googled every word
I heard that I didn't know.

335
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:17,832
- Flop. River.
- Fourth Street.

336
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,864
Fourth Street. Tilt. Cooler.

337
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:22,030
- Boat. Nuts.
- Yeah, he's pot committed.

338
00:15:22,032 --> 00:15:23,032
Playing the rush.

339
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:27,365
You keeping track
of the buy-ins?

340
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:29,964
- Yeah.
- Where? Where's the paper?

341
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:31,165
Spreadsheet.

342
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:39,167
Yeah, motherfucker.

343
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,835
All in.

344
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:47,130
The game ended at 3:30.

345
00:15:47,132 --> 00:15:49,165
And when it did,
that's when Dean shouted out...

346
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:54,297
Hey, tip Molly if you wanna
get invited back next week.

347
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:55,931
Tip Molly.

348
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:59,364
Deep down, I didn't like
the sound of that.

349
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:00,864
Deep down, I knew
that when your boss says...

350
00:16:00,866 --> 00:16:02,164
- And Molly.
- Yeah.

351
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,997
Don't fucking tell anybody.

352
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:05,231
That's usually
not the beginning

353
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:06,498
of a promising law career.

354
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,033
See you next week.

355
00:16:10,432 --> 00:16:12,632
But that was deep down.

356
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:14,633
I just made $3000.

357
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,997
What are you reading?

358
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:43,464
"The Crucible."

359
00:16:43,466 --> 00:16:45,063
For school?

360
00:16:45,065 --> 00:16:46,534
My father assigned it.

361
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:52,532
Do you know how many witches
were burned at Salem?

362
00:16:52,534 --> 00:16:54,130
- How many?
- None.

363
00:16:54,132 --> 00:16:56,631
They didn't burn witches.
It's a myth. They hanged them.

364
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:59,833
Or drowned them, or crushed them
with heavy rocks.

365
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:03,532
Wait. Aren't...
You're Molly Bloom.

366
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:05,497
- Right?
- Yeah.

367
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:07,931
You don't look the same
as in your photos.

368
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:09,401
None of us do.

369
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:12,398
- Molly.
- Yes.

370
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,930
- I'm Charlie Jaffey.
- Oh.

371
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,897
Thank you again
for seeing me so early.

372
00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:18,298
- This is my daughter, Stella.
- We met.

373
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,930
Isabel will be here in 45
minutes to take you to school.

374
00:17:20,932 --> 00:17:22,764
- Finish your math?
- Yeah.

375
00:17:22,766 --> 00:17:24,697
- Civ? You know it?
- Yeah.

376
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:26,264
Could you teach it
in class today?

377
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:29,664
If I asked you to teach me
Roman Law, could you do it?

378
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,799
- Yes.
- Okay.

379
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:35,732
So. First things first.

380
00:17:35,734 --> 00:17:37,654
When was the last time you
slept? Today's Friday.

381
00:17:38,664 --> 00:17:40,564
Tuesday morning at 5 a. m.,
I was arrested by the FBI.

382
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:42,798
I spent Tuesday
in L.A. County Jail.

383
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,497
I was assessed to be
a minimal flight risk

384
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:46,231
and bail was set
at a $100,000.

385
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,931
My mother signed over her house.

386
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,930
I was released on Wednesday
and ordered to appear

387
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:53,165
in Federal Court
in New York's Southern District.

388
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:54,864
10 a. m. today.

389
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:55,900
In here.

390
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:58,401
Close that, will you?

391
00:18:02,065 --> 00:18:05,030
I flew here Wednesday and met
with five attorneys yesterday.

392
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:07,931
Have a seat.
You didn't hire any of them?

393
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:09,632
Three of them had
already been taken.

394
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:11,763
Yeah, 31 people were named
in your indictment.

395
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:13,231
It's Black Friday
for criminal lawyers.

396
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:14,464
How about the other two?

397
00:18:14,466 --> 00:18:15,531
One told me money was his

398
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:16,963
second favorite form of payment.

399
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:18,430
- I know him.
- The fifth was also taken.

400
00:18:18,432 --> 00:18:20,665
- But he recommended I call you.
- Why?

401
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,197
I told him I wanted someone
who'd worked in

402
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:24,899
the prosecutor's office and
wasn't even a little bit shady.

403
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:29,430
Do you know about me?

404
00:18:29,432 --> 00:18:32,231
Um, I've been briefed a little
by my daughter, who knows

405
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:34,696
a lot about your story
because her mother's a moron.

406
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:37,930
- Her mother reads the tabloids?
- Yeah, and I read them too.

407
00:18:37,932 --> 00:18:40,231
I read your indictment
after I got your call last night

408
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:42,130
and I bought your book.

409
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:44,365
I'm only on page 112,
but, Molly, did you commit

410
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:46,131
a felony and then write
a book about it?

411
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:47,532
I haven't run a game
in over two years.

412
00:18:47,534 --> 00:18:48,764
Not to spoil the ending,
but that's

413
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:49,930
when the government
raided my game

414
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:51,564
and took all my money assuming

415
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:54,097
all of it was made illegally,
which it wasn't.

416
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,131
I've been living in my
mother's house in Telluride

417
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:59,863
and... I wrote the book so I
could start paying off debts.

418
00:18:59,865 --> 00:19:01,864
I just finished the press tour
for the book and I moved back

419
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:04,831
to Los Angeles
so I could start over.

420
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:08,497
Hm. You ran games in L.A.
for roughly eight years?

421
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:10,664
- Yeah. Right.
- Without taking a rake?

422
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,498
And then you ran games
in New York for roughly two.

423
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,632
Well, I took a rake
for the last six months.

424
00:19:14,634 --> 00:19:19,264
In the first 112 pages,
you name a bunch of names.

425
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:20,598
- Sorry?
- Uh.

426
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,830
You named the names
of some movie stars

427
00:19:21,832 --> 00:19:24,131
that played in your game.

428
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:25,663
Yeah.

429
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,866
That not against
some sort of poker code?

430
00:19:30,065 --> 00:19:31,598
Am I supposed to be sitting
all the way over here?

431
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,434
- Can you hear me from there?
- Yeah.

432
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:36,630
Are you taking me
on as a client?

433
00:19:36,632 --> 00:19:38,630
My retainer is $250,000.

434
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:41,100
Do you have $250,000?

435
00:19:42,267 --> 00:19:44,764
No. I don't have anything.

436
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,198
What about the sales
from your book?

437
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,598
The book isn't
jumping off the shelves.

438
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,598
But I will find a way
to pay you, Charlie.

439
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,966
Ask around about me.

440
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:54,831
Unfortunately,
the people I'd ask

441
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,731
are goin' away for a while.

442
00:19:56,733 --> 00:19:59,630
What happened on Tuesday morning
was called a "GPS Takedown."

443
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,897
Thirty-one people were arrested
in the same instant.

444
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:04,430
Something in excess
of 600 agents were dispatched

445
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:06,130
to locations
in New York and L.A.

446
00:20:06,132 --> 00:20:08,330
in coordinated strikes
with automatic weapons.

447
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,565
And you're trying to tell me
you're in my office

448
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:13,398
because you raked a game
of Texas Hold 'Em?

449
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,630
Have you seen the other names
in your indictment?

450
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,931
"Nicholas Kozlowski.
Peter Druzhinsky.

451
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:19,696
Peter Antonovich.
The Gershen Brothers."

452
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:21,198
I mean come on, Molly,
just how deep

453
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,531
into the Russian mob were you?

454
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:24,066
Because your book doesn't say.

455
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:43,497
Why are you making your daughter
read "The Crucible?"

456
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:44,930
So she can see
what happens to a group

457
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:46,731
of bored teenage girls
when they gossip.

458
00:20:46,733 --> 00:20:48,431
- I never read the play.
- Many consider it to be...

459
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:49,864
The best play
of the 20th century.

460
00:20:49,866 --> 00:20:51,064
Is that what
many consider it to be...

461
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:53,563
I don't defend
violent criminals.

462
00:20:53,565 --> 00:20:55,664
- I've never hurt anyone...
- Your friends have.

463
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,664
I've never heard of 90%
of the names...

464
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,763
- On the indictment.
- And the other 10%?

465
00:20:58,765 --> 00:20:59,864
I didn't know they were
connected.

466
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:01,097
I'd no idea
who they were.

467
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:02,697
Let me ask you a question.

468
00:21:02,699 --> 00:21:05,664
The character in the book
you call "Dean Keith"

469
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:08,498
he didn't say
"Poor people bagels," did he?

470
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,864
I think I know who he is.

471
00:21:09,866 --> 00:21:11,030
I think I know
a real estate lawyer

472
00:21:11,032 --> 00:21:12,331
that worked with him
and quit.

473
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,697
He said...

474
00:21:13,699 --> 00:21:15,133
"Nigger bagels," right?

475
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:23,031
I'm not telling you his real
name. He's not involved in this.

476
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:25,167
But you were willing
to name some names.

477
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:33,331
Why is the FBI arresting me

478
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,830
two years after
I stopped running games?

479
00:21:34,832 --> 00:21:36,998
Were you paid extra
in your book deal

480
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,600
to name the movie stars?

481
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:44,397
I'm not your guy, Molly.

482
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:47,666
I wish you good luck,
but this just isn't for me.

483
00:21:57,466 --> 00:21:59,663
I didn't know
who the Russians were.

484
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:02,063
I can get you
the $250,000.

485
00:22:02,065 --> 00:22:03,531
I left 10 times
that on the street.

486
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:04,630
It'll just take some time.

487
00:22:04,632 --> 00:22:05,864
We regularly lend out our best

488
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,164
litigators like me to the ACLU

489
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,563
Southern Poverty Law Center,
veterans groups.

490
00:22:10,565 --> 00:22:12,798
But I don't think
I can convince my partners

491
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,931
to take a flyer
on "The Poker Princess."

492
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,730
I didn't name myself
"The Poker Princess."

493
00:22:16,732 --> 00:22:20,063
Uh, "Molly Bloom, the self
proclaimed Poker Princess..."

494
00:22:20,065 --> 00:22:21,231
Is that "Us Weekly?"

495
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:22,864
Yeah, I would agree
it would be unusual

496
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:24,798
for them to print
something that wasn't true.

497
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,265
But it's not true,
and if you think

498
00:22:26,267 --> 00:22:28,964
a Princess can do what I did,
you're incorrect.

499
00:22:28,966 --> 00:22:30,531
I'm getting you don't
think much of me.

500
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:32,531
But what if every one
of your ill-informed

501
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:34,530
unsophisticated opinions
about me were wrong?

502
00:22:34,532 --> 00:22:35,864
- I'd be amazed.
- Yeah. You know what, bud?

503
00:22:35,866 --> 00:22:37,431
- You would.
- You don't need me.

504
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:40,401
- You need a publicist.
- No, I need a fucking lawyer!

505
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,967
You didn't answer my question.

506
00:22:51,765 --> 00:22:53,500
When was the last time
you slept?

507
00:22:56,499 --> 00:22:57,967
It was a while ago.

508
00:23:06,432 --> 00:23:08,198
Alright.

509
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,863
I'm gonna walk you through
the arraignment this morning

510
00:23:09,865 --> 00:23:11,298
'cause you shouldn't
do that alone.

511
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,264
I'm gonna put some bodies
on you and walk you

512
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,297
through the side door,
'cause I don't know

513
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:16,331
what you've got on the Russians.

514
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,831
But neither do they.

515
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:19,597
And the Russians
take care of shit.

516
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,134
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

517
00:23:23,933 --> 00:23:25,000
Yes.

518
00:23:30,632 --> 00:23:33,596
Almost. You gotta keep
your eyes up, alright?

519
00:23:33,598 --> 00:23:35,131
Always gotta look ahead.

520
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:36,164
If you look down

521
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,399
that's where
you're gonna go.

522
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:40,463
Alright?

523
00:23:40,465 --> 00:23:41,696
If you look down

524
00:23:41,698 --> 00:23:43,831
that's where you'll go,
alright?

525
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,667
- Yeah.
- Alright.

526
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,798
Let's go.

527
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,298
My father's a therapist

528
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,430
and psychology professor
at Colorado State.

529
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,863
No! No!

530
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:55,930
The second rule of his house

531
00:23:55,932 --> 00:23:57,496
is that academic excellence

532
00:23:57,498 --> 00:23:59,531
and athletic excellence
weren't optional.

533
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:01,696
You can't be afraid of it,
alright?

534
00:24:01,698 --> 00:24:03,430
Don't play defense.

535
00:24:03,432 --> 00:24:04,564
And the first rule

536
00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:05,831
was that he made all the rules.

537
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:06,697
Again.

538
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:08,429
Dad, I'm pretty tired.

539
00:24:08,431 --> 00:24:10,463
Hon, she's tired.

540
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:12,396
We've been out here
since 6 o'clock.

541
00:24:12,398 --> 00:24:13,866
Her lips are blue.

542
00:24:15,232 --> 00:24:16,866
- You're tired?
- Yeah.

543
00:24:20,132 --> 00:24:21,599
What's another word for tired?

544
00:24:23,633 --> 00:24:26,467
Name a synonym for tired
and we'll get in the car.

545
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:28,998
Weak.

546
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,663
That's right.

547
00:24:30,665 --> 00:24:31,899
Let's go home.

548
00:24:32,532 --> 00:24:34,730
Again.

549
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:37,197
I decided to postpone
law school another year.

550
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:39,364
After six weeks of tips,
I went to Barneys

551
00:24:39,366 --> 00:24:42,297
and asked for a dress that made
me look nothing like myself.

552
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,230
I'd overheard stories
about games that folded

553
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:47,696
after one bad night and I
needed this one to keep going.

554
00:24:47,698 --> 00:24:50,097
And I needed to bring
value to it.

555
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:52,265
I knew if I
wanted to cement my place

556
00:24:52,267 --> 00:24:54,130
there was one guy I needed
to team up with.

557
00:24:54,132 --> 00:24:55,297
Ten thousand.

558
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:56,964
And that was this man.

559
00:24:56,966 --> 00:24:59,396
The game had regulars
and the game had guests.

560
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,663
And four of the regulars
were famous actors.

561
00:25:01,665 --> 00:25:03,597
And I'm gonna call one of them
Player X.

562
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:04,863
I'm all in.

563
00:25:04,865 --> 00:25:05,930
Player X subscribed

564
00:25:05,932 --> 00:25:07,497
to the belief that money won

565
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:08,998
was twice as good
as money earned.

566
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,697
He lived to beat people
and take their money.

567
00:25:11,699 --> 00:25:13,429
Here's Player X
talking to one of the guests

568
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:14,696
into folding the winning hand.

569
00:25:14,698 --> 00:25:17,063
I swear on... look at me.

570
00:25:17,065 --> 00:25:19,466
I swear on my mother's life,
I have you.

571
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,597
Player X was the best
player at the table, and tonight...

572
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:27,067
this guy was the worst.

573
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,363
He's staring at his cards.

574
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:33,964
Even a reasonably good amateur

575
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:36,197
would know it was
mathematically the best hand.

576
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:38,430
Which in poker
is called "The Nuts."

577
00:25:38,432 --> 00:25:40,198
There was $47,000 in the pot

578
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,831
and the guest
was holding the nuts.

579
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,296
But he was starting
to get confused

580
00:25:43,298 --> 00:25:44,964
because a movie star
was talking to him.

581
00:25:44,966 --> 00:25:47,131
My mother's life man,
I'm not messing with you.

582
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:48,164
Why would you be telling me?

583
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,363
Either I am messing with you

584
00:25:49,365 --> 00:25:50,464
or you're new to the game.

585
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:51,697
You've had bad cards all night.

586
00:25:51,699 --> 00:25:53,563
You should've folded
after the flop

587
00:25:53,565 --> 00:25:55,197
and I don't wanna win
more of your money this way.

588
00:25:55,199 --> 00:25:56,499
I've got queens under here.

589
00:25:57,866 --> 00:25:59,000
Take your time.

590
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:14,530
- Fold.
- Fuck you.

591
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,564
- No!
- Oh.

592
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,530
A fish is a
particular kind of player.

593
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:28,131
A fish has money.

594
00:26:28,133 --> 00:26:30,731
A fish plays loose
and doesn't fold a lot.

595
00:26:30,733 --> 00:26:33,530
A fish is good...
but not too good.

596
00:26:33,532 --> 00:26:34,963
There's an ATM in the hall, bro.

597
00:26:34,965 --> 00:26:36,198
The Cobra Lounge may belong

598
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,631
to Dean Keith.

599
00:26:37,633 --> 00:26:39,131
But the game belonged
to Player X.

600
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:40,863
People wanted to say
they played with him.

601
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,196
The same way they wanted to say

602
00:26:42,198 --> 00:26:43,763
they rode on Air Force One.

603
00:26:43,765 --> 00:26:45,396
My job security
was gonna depend

604
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:47,030
on bringing him his fish.

605
00:26:47,032 --> 00:26:48,730
But where would I find people
with a lot of money

606
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,130
who didn't know how to spend it

607
00:26:50,132 --> 00:26:51,731
and liked to be
around celebrities?

608
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:53,463
If they say
they're interested in poker

609
00:26:53,465 --> 00:26:55,730
you give 'em my number,
I vet them.

610
00:26:55,732 --> 00:26:57,296
They end up playing in a game...

611
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:00,296
I'll give you a $1000
the first time they play.

612
00:27:00,298 --> 00:27:02,597
Five hundred every time
after that.

613
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:05,164
Be sure to mention
these guys are all regulars.

614
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,397
Is this true?

615
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:07,633
These guys play?

616
00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:12,731
The Commerce Casino is
off the 5 freeway in East L.A.

617
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:15,764
And no one's ever gonna confuse
it with Monte Carlo.

618
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:17,363
I'd watch the tables
for a while

619
00:27:17,365 --> 00:27:19,429
before I approached
a friendly-looking pit boss.

620
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:22,263
Third chair
at table eight can't lose.

621
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:25,330
Unless there are players
at his table who can win.

622
00:27:25,332 --> 00:27:27,964
You know about the game
at the Cobra Lounge, right?

623
00:27:27,966 --> 00:27:28,997
Sure.

624
00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:31,430
One thousand for every player
you send me.

625
00:27:31,432 --> 00:27:33,430
You get a piece
of what they lose.

626
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:34,931
No pros.

627
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:36,964
I'm Molly.

628
00:27:36,966 --> 00:27:38,563
Poker was my Trojan horse

629
00:27:38,565 --> 00:27:41,396
into the highest level
of finance, technology

630
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:43,264
politics, entertainment, art.

631
00:27:43,266 --> 00:27:44,797
All I had to do was listen.

632
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,764
The art world is controlled
by a few major dealers.

633
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:48,997
China's Telecom companies wanna
partner with other providers.

634
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:50,696
The owners don't mind
spending $30 million

635
00:27:50,698 --> 00:27:53,197
on an outfielder
that hits 320 with 110 RBI.

636
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:54,530
They alone control the market.

637
00:27:54,532 --> 00:27:56,898
They chose the artist
they wanna be important.

638
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,363
They don't mind
spending $10 million

639
00:27:58,365 --> 00:28:00,597
on a pitcher
who is 8-14 this season.

640
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,197
- It's gonna be Gephardt.
- They set the prices.

641
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:05,097
They even mark 'em up,
70, 80, 90 percent.

642
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:07,898
They're all very excited
about a company called Twitter.

643
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,230
Unregulated money.
Usually all cash. Unreported.

644
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:12,030
- His days are numbered.
- His days are numbered.

645
00:28:12,032 --> 00:28:13,396
I don't know how much longer
she's gonna be in that job.

646
00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:14,429
- She's done.
- She's gone.

647
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:15,863
All in.

648
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:16,898
People have asked me what

649
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,297
my goal was at that point.

650
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:19,931
What was my end game?

651
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:22,463
Back then, I would have
laughed at that question.

652
00:28:22,465 --> 00:28:24,229
I was raised to be a champion.

653
00:28:24,231 --> 00:28:25,764
My goal was to win.

654
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:27,563
At what and against whom?

655
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:29,963
- Those were just details.
- I'm all in.

656
00:28:29,965 --> 00:28:31,264
I had my own apartment now.

657
00:28:31,266 --> 00:28:32,396
I'll take it.

658
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:34,429
A new car...

659
00:28:34,431 --> 00:28:36,696
and $17,000 in a shoebox.

660
00:28:36,698 --> 00:28:38,667
Law school could wait
one more year.

661
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:43,930
Next, please. Come on through.

662
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:47,798
Step on up please. Thank you.
Come on through.

663
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,396
So. Here's all that's
gonna happen today.

664
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:51,831
Judge is gonna ask
each defendant

665
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:53,130
if they've read the indictment

666
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:55,363
or they'd like the court
to read it to them.

667
00:28:55,365 --> 00:28:57,696
Then the judge is gonna ask
how you plead.

668
00:28:57,698 --> 00:28:59,731
You're gonna answer,
"Not guilty."

669
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:01,163
I'll make it clear
for the record

670
00:29:01,165 --> 00:29:02,229
that I'm not your counsel

671
00:29:02,231 --> 00:29:03,496
but I am appearing
on your behalf

672
00:29:03,498 --> 00:29:04,563
at the arraignment.

673
00:29:04,565 --> 00:29:06,097
In propria persona.

674
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:08,396
In propria persona
means on your behalf.

675
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:09,663
- Yeah.
- No.

676
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,296
I'm saying it means
on your behalf.

677
00:29:11,298 --> 00:29:12,496
I am appearing on your behalf.

678
00:29:12,498 --> 00:29:13,531
In propria persona means

679
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:15,062
you're appearing on your behalf.

680
00:29:15,064 --> 00:29:16,399
Not my behalf.

681
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,497
I'll check that out,
but the point is...

682
00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:21,863
I'm not your lawyer.

683
00:29:21,865 --> 00:29:23,866
And I'll make that clear
for the record.

684
00:29:42,466 --> 00:29:44,531
That's us over there.

685
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,230
You know, why don't you
sit there?

686
00:29:46,232 --> 00:29:47,733
And you sit on the other side.

687
00:29:54,832 --> 00:29:57,830
You've gotta good judge.
He's a good guy.

688
00:29:57,832 --> 00:30:00,697
- Counsel, please...
- How about the prosecutor?

689
00:30:00,699 --> 00:30:02,531
Good morning, Your
Honor, Harrison Wellstone

690
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:04,931
Assistant U.S. Attorney
for the Southern District

691
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:07,230
joined at counsel table
by Assistant U.S. Attorney

692
00:30:07,232 --> 00:30:11,397
Eric Brennan and FBI
Special Agent Deborah D'Angelo.

693
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:12,863
Thank you.

694
00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:15,062
Are there any oral motions
at this time?

695
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,497
Switch with me.

696
00:30:18,665 --> 00:30:20,831
On behalf of the defendant...

697
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:23,597
Just in case your lawyer
doesn't mention it

698
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,931
next time you appear
in front of the judge

699
00:30:24,933 --> 00:30:27,898
you might wanna re-think
your clothes. Okay?

700
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,967
You look like the Cinemax
version of yourself.

701
00:30:31,431 --> 00:30:33,396
I sold my clothes
when the government seized

702
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,063
all of my money two years ago.

703
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:37,631
Which, incidentally,
was the last time I ran a game.

704
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:40,229
But I think
I already mentioned that.

705
00:30:40,231 --> 00:30:41,798
- Okay.
- Not guilty.

706
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,196
- Thank you, you may be seated.
- Hey. Switch back.

707
00:30:43,198 --> 00:30:46,931
Defendant number two.
Nicholas Segel.

708
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:49,397
Has the defendant seen
a copy of the indictment?

709
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:50,731
Yes, Your Honor.

710
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:52,230
Have you discussed it
with your lawyer?

711
00:30:52,232 --> 00:30:53,864
Yes.

712
00:30:53,866 --> 00:30:54,864
Switch back.

713
00:30:54,866 --> 00:30:56,364
Yes.

714
00:30:56,366 --> 00:30:58,996
- And how do you plead?
- Not guilty.

715
00:30:58,998 --> 00:31:01,062
Thank you,
you may have your seat.

716
00:31:01,064 --> 00:31:02,563
Your old boss.

717
00:31:02,565 --> 00:31:04,696
The one in the book
you called Dean Keith.

718
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:06,264
He was terrible to you.

719
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:08,229
Why cover up for him
by changing it

720
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:09,863
to "poor people bagels?"

721
00:31:09,865 --> 00:31:12,463
I promise you
it couldn't matter less.

722
00:31:12,465 --> 00:31:14,997
Has the defendant seen
a copy of the indictment?

723
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:18,296
- Just making conversation.
- Yes, your honor.

724
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:20,597
- Hey, switch back.
- Discussed with your lawyer?

725
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:23,631
- I have.
- How do you plead this time?

726
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:24,997
Not guilty.

727
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:26,764
Have a seat.

728
00:31:26,766 --> 00:31:29,696
Defendant number four.
Molly Bloom.

729
00:31:36,231 --> 00:31:38,798
Good morning, Your Honor.
Uh, Charles Jaffey

730
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,467
for the defendant,
just for the purposes...

731
00:31:48,498 --> 00:31:51,329
Well, it's good to see you,
Mr. Jaffey.

732
00:31:51,331 --> 00:31:52,800
Are you with us this morning?

733
00:31:55,598 --> 00:31:57,630
Mr. Jaffey?

734
00:31:57,632 --> 00:32:00,962
Uh, yes, sir.
Just, uh, one moment.

735
00:32:00,964 --> 00:32:04,697
- Switch back.
- Seriously?

736
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:06,996
You said you left ten times
that much on the street.

737
00:32:06,998 --> 00:32:10,962
In my office, when I said
the retainer was $250,000

738
00:32:10,964 --> 00:32:13,264
you said,
"I left ten times that much..."

739
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:14,631
Yeah.

740
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,929
Counsel! I need to record
your appearance.

741
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:20,763
If it please the court,
Your Honor, Just one moment.

742
00:32:20,765 --> 00:32:23,029
You're extended credit,
you're destitute

743
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:25,264
and you leave two and a half
million dollars on the street?

744
00:32:25,266 --> 00:32:26,797
I had to.

745
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,263
Didn't anyone try
to buy your debt sheet?

746
00:32:28,265 --> 00:32:30,631
Everyone tried to buy my debt
sheet. Is this...

747
00:32:30,633 --> 00:32:33,197
Why didn't you sell it like
you sold your clothes?

748
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:35,996
- I couldn't.
- Why?

749
00:32:35,998 --> 00:32:38,667
I couldn't be sure
how they were gonna collect.

750
00:32:41,932 --> 00:32:44,065
I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

751
00:32:49,265 --> 00:32:50,430
Counsel!

752
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:53,029
Yes, your Honor. Uh...

753
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:54,597
Charles Jaffey
for the defendant.

754
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,062
For the purposes
of this hearing only?

755
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,463
No, sir.
I am Molly Bloom's attorney.

756
00:32:58,465 --> 00:33:00,863
Uh, she's read the indictment,
discussed it with her lawyer.

757
00:33:00,865 --> 00:33:02,497
Waives the right
to have it read to her

758
00:33:02,499 --> 00:33:05,229
and pleads "Not guilty."

759
00:33:05,231 --> 00:33:07,196
Thank you, you may be seated.

760
00:33:07,198 --> 00:33:09,962
Defendant number five!
Ilian Gershen!

761
00:33:09,964 --> 00:33:11,997
Good morning, Your Honor.

762
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:13,599
I'm gonna have to keep
reading your book.

763
00:33:16,331 --> 00:33:18,530
There was a track
star of the 1930's

764
00:33:18,532 --> 00:33:20,663
named Matthew Robinson.

765
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,596
Matthew Robinson shattered
the Olympic record

766
00:33:22,598 --> 00:33:26,230
in the 200
at the Berlin Games in 1936.

767
00:33:26,232 --> 00:33:29,730
Absolutely shattered
the Olympic record...

768
00:33:29,732 --> 00:33:31,229
and came in second.

769
00:33:31,231 --> 00:33:34,129
The man who came in first
was Jesse Owens.

770
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:36,196
Jesse Owens went on
to be a legend.

771
00:33:36,198 --> 00:33:38,396
Matthew Robinson
went on to be a janitor

772
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:40,764
at a whites-only
middle school in Pasadena.

773
00:33:40,766 --> 00:33:43,862
The difference
was 4/10 of a second.

774
00:33:43,864 --> 00:33:45,263
As if that wasn't enough

775
00:33:45,265 --> 00:33:46,731
Matthew Robinson
had a little brother

776
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,763
who was also an athlete.

777
00:33:47,765 --> 00:33:49,865
His name was Jackie.

778
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:51,862
I have two younger brothers

779
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,696
who are overachievers as well.

780
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,129
While I was ranked third
in North America

781
00:33:56,131 --> 00:33:58,963
my brother Jeremy
was number one in the world.

782
00:33:58,965 --> 00:34:02,429
And while I was placing into
AP Chemistry as a sophomore

783
00:34:02,431 --> 00:34:03,862
my brother Jordan was doing it

784
00:34:03,864 --> 00:34:05,229
when he was 12-years-old
or something.

785
00:34:05,231 --> 00:34:06,763
I don't know.

786
00:34:06,765 --> 00:34:08,962
I was a hot shot student
and a hot shot skier

787
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:10,996
everywhere but my own house.

788
00:34:10,998 --> 00:34:14,097
As I got older, I began
to bait my father into fights

789
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:15,830
without really knowing
why I was doing it.

790
00:34:15,832 --> 00:34:17,899
What did everyone
learn in school today?

791
00:34:22,932 --> 00:34:25,430
Uh... I learned
that Sigmund Freud

792
00:34:25,432 --> 00:34:26,962
was both a misogynist
and an idiot.

793
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:28,897
And anyone who relies
on his theories

794
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:30,530
of human psychology is a quack.

795
00:34:30,532 --> 00:34:31,829
I don't know why you'd say that.

796
00:34:31,831 --> 00:34:33,897
You asked me what I
learned in school today.

797
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:35,666
- Is this Mrs. Linwood?
- Yup.

798
00:34:36,764 --> 00:34:38,430
Did she happen
to mention anything

799
00:34:38,432 --> 00:34:40,397
about his work
on the unconscious mind?

800
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,296
His dream analysis has
the credibility of a horoscope.

801
00:34:43,298 --> 00:34:44,897
But what got my attention

802
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:47,196
was that he opposed the women's
emancipation movement.

803
00:34:47,198 --> 00:34:48,463
He believed that a woman's life

804
00:34:48,465 --> 00:34:49,829
is about her
reproductive functions.

805
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:51,464
So you're really getting
to the nuts and bolts

806
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:52,696
of why middle-class
suburban white girls

807
00:34:52,698 --> 00:34:53,863
have been oppressed
for centuries.

808
00:34:53,865 --> 00:34:55,063
No, Mrs. Linwood was just...

809
00:34:55,065 --> 00:34:58,397
Barbara Linwood
doesn't like men, Molly.

810
00:34:58,399 --> 00:35:00,796
She doesn't like dicks,
dad, there's a difference.

811
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:02,065
Molly...

812
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:07,829
Don't disrespect me
like that at the table.

813
00:35:07,831 --> 00:35:08,862
I wasn't disrespecting you.

814
00:35:08,864 --> 00:35:10,631
I was disrespecting Freud.

815
00:35:10,633 --> 00:35:11,930
And it's the kitchen table

816
00:35:11,932 --> 00:35:13,496
not the tomb
of the unknown soldier.

817
00:35:13,498 --> 00:35:15,763
And I'm a professional
psychologist, not a quack.

818
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:17,197
- I never said you were...
- Yeah, you did.

819
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,533
And don't do it again.

820
00:35:21,532 --> 00:35:23,229
And don't ever use language
like that again.

821
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:25,896
Okay. Ignore my teachers,
watch my language

822
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:27,596
and respect the kitchen table.

823
00:35:27,598 --> 00:35:28,830
What else do I
need to do before

824
00:35:28,832 --> 00:35:30,229
I'm allowed
to disagree with you?

825
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:31,496
Make your own money

826
00:35:31,498 --> 00:35:34,196
so you can live
in your own house...

827
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,665
and eat your own food.

828
00:35:38,565 --> 00:35:40,630
I'd been running
the game for three years

829
00:35:40,632 --> 00:35:43,296
and saved $58,000.

830
00:35:43,298 --> 00:35:44,930
I was recruiting
and vetting players.

831
00:35:44,932 --> 00:35:46,329
- Keeping the books.
- Call.

832
00:35:46,331 --> 00:35:47,796
Collecting
and delivering checks.

833
00:35:47,798 --> 00:35:49,230
Meeting the needs
of all the players

834
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:50,663
through out the week
and still working

835
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:52,229
full time for Dean Keith.

836
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:54,497
Who made it clear that
if I quit the office job

837
00:35:54,499 --> 00:35:55,563
I'd lose the game.

838
00:35:55,565 --> 00:35:57,229
- Call.
- Eights, full of nines.

839
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:09,029
I thought he had trips too.

840
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:10,663
He was slow-playing
into the river

841
00:36:10,665 --> 00:36:12,630
and he hid the pocket eights
pretty well.

842
00:36:12,632 --> 00:36:14,364
It's a tough beat, man.

843
00:36:14,366 --> 00:36:16,799
- You owe the game...
- I know what I owe the game!

844
00:36:19,764 --> 00:36:20,863
I wanna talk to you a minute.

845
00:36:20,865 --> 00:36:22,329
- Okay.
- In the hall.

846
00:36:33,298 --> 00:36:34,632
Is he cheating?

847
00:36:35,765 --> 00:36:36,729
No.

848
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:39,030
- How would you know?
- I'd know.

849
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:40,364
He and Diego
aren't in bed together?

850
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:41,666
No.

851
00:36:42,532 --> 00:36:44,596
What about him and you?

852
00:36:44,598 --> 00:36:46,062
A 52 card deck produces

853
00:36:46,064 --> 00:36:48,596
hundreds of millions
of random patterns.

854
00:36:48,598 --> 00:36:50,896
But every time one of you loses
two weeks in a row

855
00:36:50,898 --> 00:36:52,397
you're sure something fishy
is going on?

856
00:36:52,399 --> 00:36:53,632
Come on.

857
00:36:56,533 --> 00:36:58,830
I'm gonna stop paying you.

858
00:36:58,832 --> 00:37:02,130
- What do you mean?
- As my assistant.

859
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:03,564
- Are you firing me?
- I'm not firing you.

860
00:37:03,566 --> 00:37:04,730
I'm just gonna stop paying you.

861
00:37:04,732 --> 00:37:06,097
You get paid once a week
from the game.

862
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,496
It doesn't seem fair.

863
00:37:07,498 --> 00:37:08,896
But I also have a job working
for you 24 hours...

864
00:37:08,898 --> 00:37:10,896
And if you didn't have a job

865
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:13,063
you wouldn't have the game.
You understand what I'm saying?

866
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,062
I understand each of the words
that you're saying but I don't...

867
00:37:15,064 --> 00:37:17,797
- Look!
- 24 hours a day, every day.

868
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:19,229
But you're gonna stop paying me
to do that job

869
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:21,464
because I'm making too much
money doing my second job?

870
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:23,230
And if I say no,
I'll lose both jobs?

871
00:37:23,232 --> 00:37:24,463
Because it doesn't seem fair?

872
00:37:24,465 --> 00:37:26,563
Business is bad right now.

873
00:37:26,565 --> 00:37:27,966
Welcome to the real world.

874
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:32,563
Alright, here it is.
Banks are loaning you money.

875
00:37:32,565 --> 00:37:33,897
And they shouldn't.

876
00:37:33,899 --> 00:37:35,497
You're a bad risk, they know it.

877
00:37:35,499 --> 00:37:36,963
So the debt service
on your loans

878
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:39,397
is close to 20%,
which is crazy.

879
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:41,397
Twenty percent is
barely survivable

880
00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:42,797
if it's a bridge loan.

881
00:37:42,799 --> 00:37:44,430
But, like for instance

882
00:37:44,432 --> 00:37:47,562
it's taken you 10 years
to build seven houses.

883
00:37:47,564 --> 00:37:49,529
All of which are worth
less than they were

884
00:37:49,531 --> 00:37:51,596
before you built them,
because the housing market

885
00:37:51,598 --> 00:37:53,763
is on a downward trajectory
for the first time

886
00:37:53,765 --> 00:37:54,930
in the history of houses.

887
00:37:54,932 --> 00:37:57,497
And that's why business
is doing bad.

888
00:37:57,499 --> 00:38:00,197
Not because you're paying me
$450 a week.

889
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,496
You're a business savant?

890
00:38:01,498 --> 00:38:02,962
I've read every piece of paper
in your office.

891
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:04,663
You're making thousands
in tips every week.

892
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:06,196
Why do you care about $450?

893
00:38:06,198 --> 00:38:07,997
Because I don't want to pick up
your dry cleaning for free!

894
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:11,329
Well, you don't have
bargaining power here!

895
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:13,899
You can refuse the pay cut
but you could lose the game.

896
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:17,399
Cash me out, please.

897
00:38:19,098 --> 00:38:20,529
I wasn't gonna wait for Dean

898
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:21,729
to take the game away from me

899
00:38:21,731 --> 00:38:24,097
before I put a plan in place.

900
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:25,662
The next morning,
I made appointments

901
00:38:25,664 --> 00:38:27,463
at the Four Seasons,
The Peninsula

902
00:38:27,465 --> 00:38:29,065
and the Beverly Hills Hotel.

903
00:38:30,198 --> 00:38:33,329
The suite was $5200 a night.

904
00:38:33,331 --> 00:38:34,997
I spent $17,000

905
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:37,662
on a shuffle master that was
installed in the table.

906
00:38:37,664 --> 00:38:39,695
Faster, more reliable shuffles.

907
00:38:39,697 --> 00:38:41,230
Less downtime between hands.

908
00:38:41,232 --> 00:38:42,897
Food was brought in
from Mr. Chow

909
00:38:42,899 --> 00:38:45,297
and available to eat
on the side tables.

910
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:46,630
There was Macallan 18

911
00:38:46,632 --> 00:38:48,630
Belvedere, 1942

912
00:38:48,632 --> 00:38:51,062
Remy Martin,
and a '88 Lafite Rothschild

913
00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:54,063
served by a bartender who'd
already memorized your drink.

914
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:57,096
Cohibas and Monte Cristo
were in the humidor.

915
00:38:57,098 --> 00:38:58,862
A professional stylist
turned me

916
00:38:58,864 --> 00:39:00,696
into what my defense attorney
would later call

917
00:39:00,698 --> 00:39:03,230
"The Cinemax version
of myself."

918
00:39:03,232 --> 00:39:05,529
I spent almost everything
I had in preparation

919
00:39:05,531 --> 00:39:06,996
for the phone call
I knew was coming.

920
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:14,863
- Hello.
- I want you to listen to me.

921
00:39:14,865 --> 00:39:16,797
- 'Cause you need to hear this.
- Where are you?

922
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:19,029
I need to tell you something
in plain English

923
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:20,596
and I need to know
that you understood it.

924
00:39:20,598 --> 00:39:23,130
- Dean.
- You are unimportant.

925
00:39:23,132 --> 00:39:24,563
Do you hear me?

926
00:39:24,565 --> 00:39:26,630
And you are fired.

927
00:39:26,632 --> 00:39:27,929
The job, the game...

928
00:39:27,931 --> 00:39:29,929
- You're fired.
- Can I ask why?

929
00:39:29,931 --> 00:39:31,929
How many of my friends
are you sleeping with?

930
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:33,229
I'm not sleeping
with any of 'em.

931
00:39:33,231 --> 00:39:34,696
That's not what I heard.

932
00:39:34,698 --> 00:39:37,330
Listen to me.
With a HAZMAT suit, I wouldn't...

933
00:39:37,332 --> 00:39:38,998
Can I give you some advice?

934
00:39:40,198 --> 00:39:41,629
Lose the bitchy air.

935
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:43,930
Lose the superior air.

936
00:39:43,932 --> 00:39:45,562
And go to the office
and get your stuff

937
00:39:45,564 --> 00:39:47,399
and be out of there
before I show up.

938
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:49,698
Hey, are you Molly?

939
00:39:50,366 --> 00:39:51,463
Yeah.

940
00:39:51,465 --> 00:39:52,863
I'm Leah, um...

941
00:39:52,865 --> 00:39:54,930
Dean asked me
to pack your personals.

942
00:39:54,932 --> 00:39:55,963
I appreciate it.

943
00:39:55,965 --> 00:39:57,963
He also asked me
to get the numbers

944
00:39:57,965 --> 00:40:01,329
of tonight's players
so I can confirm the list.

945
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:03,130
I'm really sorry.

946
00:40:03,132 --> 00:40:04,132
Don't be.

947
00:40:05,964 --> 00:40:07,462
My phone's in my car.

948
00:40:07,464 --> 00:40:08,696
Uh, I'll text you
all the numbers

949
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,329
you need when I get downstairs.

950
00:40:10,331 --> 00:40:12,763
I texted my replacement
a bunch of random numbers

951
00:40:12,765 --> 00:40:14,130
with 310 area codes.

952
00:40:14,132 --> 00:40:15,230
Then I sent a text

953
00:40:15,232 --> 00:40:16,529
to the players for tonight

954
00:40:16,531 --> 00:40:18,030
and told them
the game had been moved

955
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:21,763
to the Four Seasons Hotel,
Suite 1401.

956
00:40:21,765 --> 00:40:24,796
- Hey, how you doing?
- Drink?

957
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,297
- Thank you very much.
- Do you a part...

958
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:27,529
I'd love to.

959
00:40:27,531 --> 00:40:29,797
Yeah?
So this guy's producing it.

960
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:31,330
You should, uh, come down.

961
00:40:31,332 --> 00:40:33,863
- Amazing.
- Yeah, it'll be fun.

962
00:40:46,764 --> 00:40:48,932
Fellas, can I have your
attention for a moment?

963
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:56,532
Where's Dean?

964
00:40:58,231 --> 00:41:01,562
I'll be hosting a game in this
suite every Tuesday night.

965
00:41:01,564 --> 00:41:04,630
If you play tonight, you'll be
guaranteed a chair for a year.

966
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:07,563
If you prefer to play
at the Cobra Lounge...

967
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,699
there'll be no hard feelings.

968
00:41:15,564 --> 00:41:16,862
Let's play.

969
00:41:16,864 --> 00:41:18,429
The game is mine now.

970
00:41:18,431 --> 00:41:21,797
I incorporated and Molly Bloom
Event Planning was born.

971
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:24,762
I paid taxes and 1099'd
my employees.

972
00:41:24,764 --> 00:41:27,164
I never became romantically
or sexually involved

973
00:41:27,166 --> 00:41:28,529
with any of the players.

974
00:41:28,531 --> 00:41:30,197
The game would have
fallen apart.

975
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:33,029
This was back when I was
still making good decisions.

976
00:41:33,031 --> 00:41:34,730
And I went to a lawyer
to make absolutely sure

977
00:41:34,732 --> 00:41:36,529
all this was legal.

978
00:41:36,531 --> 00:41:38,062
- Are you taking a rake?
- No.

979
00:41:38,064 --> 00:41:39,930
Then you're not
breaking the law.

980
00:41:39,932 --> 00:41:41,663
- But can I give you advice?
- Please.

981
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,164
There's a saying
in my business.

982
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:46,029
Don't break the law
when you're breaking the law.

983
00:41:46,031 --> 00:41:48,363
- What do you mean?
- No drugs. No prostitutes.

984
00:41:48,365 --> 00:41:49,762
No muscle to collect debts.

985
00:41:49,764 --> 00:41:51,296
Oh, I don't do
anything like that.

986
00:41:51,298 --> 00:41:53,329
But you just said
I wasn't breaking the law.

987
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:55,363
You wanna keep it that way
because you don't wanna

988
00:41:55,365 --> 00:41:57,045
break the law when
you're breaking the law.

989
00:41:58,131 --> 00:41:59,930
Am I breaking the law?

990
00:41:59,932 --> 00:42:01,097
Not really.

991
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:03,197
We're able to find out
for sure, aren't we?

992
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:04,463
Laws are written down.

993
00:42:04,465 --> 00:42:06,197
You're not taking
a percentage of the pot?

994
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:07,396
No.

995
00:42:07,398 --> 00:42:09,963
You're running a square game.

996
00:42:09,965 --> 00:42:12,264
My game had a tricky ecosystem.

997
00:42:12,265 --> 00:42:13,796
These guys could buy anything.

998
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:15,296
But here, in this room

999
00:42:15,298 --> 00:42:16,896
you couldn't buy your win.

1000
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:19,362
You couldn't buy me,
you couldn't buy the girls.

1001
00:42:19,364 --> 00:42:21,763
And you couldn't buy
a seat at the table.

1002
00:42:21,765 --> 00:42:24,396
There's nothing as sweet
as a win you have to work for.

1003
00:42:24,398 --> 00:42:28,164
And the wins and loses were
compelling, and they were real.

1004
00:42:28,166 --> 00:42:30,429
Of course, it helped that the
players were gambling addicts.

1005
00:42:30,431 --> 00:42:31,899
Can I see you for a second?

1006
00:42:37,765 --> 00:42:39,362
Jay, you're famous.

1007
00:42:39,364 --> 00:42:41,395
You are an international
rock star.

1008
00:42:41,397 --> 00:42:43,429
Oh, I wasn't sure
you'd noticed.

1009
00:42:43,431 --> 00:42:45,030
You can't send
emails like that.

1010
00:42:45,032 --> 00:42:47,129
Well, it's not a federal
production, okay?

1011
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,896
I just invited you to Cabo
for the weekend.

1012
00:42:49,898 --> 00:42:52,262
The next woman you send
an email like that to

1013
00:42:52,264 --> 00:42:53,363
is not gonna be me.

1014
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:55,130
It's going to be someone else.

1015
00:42:55,132 --> 00:42:56,329
You're playing with fire.

1016
00:42:56,331 --> 00:42:58,096
I'm telling you that
I'm in love with you

1017
00:42:58,098 --> 00:43:00,595
and you are worried about me
getting blackmailed?

1018
00:43:00,597 --> 00:43:02,729
Oh, my, that just makes me
more into you.

1019
00:43:02,731 --> 00:43:05,463
Lemon head. They won't need
to blackmail you.

1020
00:43:05,465 --> 00:43:07,896
They can get just as
much money from TMZ.

1021
00:43:07,898 --> 00:43:09,997
And TMZ will give them
what they really want.

1022
00:43:09,999 --> 00:43:11,629
Tell me the truth.
Was mine the first love letter

1023
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:12,663
you've gotten from a player?

1024
00:43:12,665 --> 00:43:14,129
It was the seventh.

1025
00:43:14,131 --> 00:43:15,562
All digitally transmitted.

1026
00:43:15,564 --> 00:43:17,395
You are begging for
your life to be turned

1027
00:43:17,397 --> 00:43:19,429
into a very public hell.

1028
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:20,796
So that's a no on Cabo?

1029
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:22,595
Why don't you just give your
wife and kids a break

1030
00:43:22,597 --> 00:43:23,996
and run 'em over with a limo?

1031
00:43:23,998 --> 00:43:25,929
I love the way that
you talk to me.

1032
00:43:25,931 --> 00:43:26,931
Oh, God.

1033
00:43:32,764 --> 00:43:34,595
- I've had a thought.
- Yeah?

1034
00:43:34,597 --> 00:43:35,832
Raise the stakes.

1035
00:43:38,731 --> 00:43:39,732
To what?

1036
00:43:40,932 --> 00:43:43,933
50k buy-in. Blinds are 250/500.

1037
00:43:47,064 --> 00:43:49,398
- That's a 500 percent hike.
- Yeah.

1038
00:43:50,764 --> 00:43:52,164
I don't think it's a good idea.

1039
00:43:52,165 --> 00:43:53,925
Could you guys give me
the room for a second?

1040
00:43:55,932 --> 00:43:56,932
Sure.

1041
00:44:02,065 --> 00:44:03,563
The players that are losing
a $100,000 a week

1042
00:44:03,565 --> 00:44:04,962
are gonna be losing
half a million.

1043
00:44:04,964 --> 00:44:06,495
The players winning
a $100,000 a week...

1044
00:44:06,497 --> 00:44:08,328
Will have no one left
to play with.

1045
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:10,695
Players are gonna get hurt,
others are gonna get killed.

1046
00:44:10,697 --> 00:44:12,695
And some will drop out.
It's not sustainable.

1047
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:13,865
We'll lose the game.

1048
00:44:15,297 --> 00:44:16,662
Find new players.

1049
00:44:16,664 --> 00:44:19,129
He meant "Find new fish."

1050
00:44:19,131 --> 00:44:20,296
I went recruiting again.

1051
00:44:20,298 --> 00:44:22,163
First up was Donnie Silverman.

1052
00:44:22,165 --> 00:44:24,495
Donnie won the World Series
of Poker last year

1053
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:26,462
and got in touch with me
through one of the players.

1054
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:28,030
Are you fucking nuts?

1055
00:44:28,032 --> 00:44:30,295
Donnie Silverman won
the World Series of Poker.

1056
00:44:30,297 --> 00:44:31,729
You can watch it online.

1057
00:44:31,731 --> 00:44:34,128
He took 11 hands
at the final table.

1058
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,595
But he had the nuts
on eight of them.

1059
00:44:36,597 --> 00:44:38,863
And three of those...

1060
00:44:38,865 --> 00:44:41,295
Three were two outers with
four players still in the hand.

1061
00:44:41,297 --> 00:44:42,596
He ran hot.

1062
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:44,763
He doesn't lock his chips down,
he's reckless.

1063
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:48,195
He gives tons of action
and he's got $12 million.

1064
00:44:52,965 --> 00:44:55,799
You know,
I don't like playing poker.

1065
00:44:56,465 --> 00:44:57,596
Why do you play?

1066
00:44:57,598 --> 00:44:59,663
I like destroying lives.

1067
00:44:59,665 --> 00:45:00,866
Give him a chair.

1068
00:45:02,397 --> 00:45:05,595
The next recruit
was Brad Marion.

1069
00:45:05,597 --> 00:45:07,196
Who everyone called Bad Brad

1070
00:45:07,198 --> 00:45:10,996
because he was uniquely
terrible at this game.

1071
00:45:10,998 --> 00:45:13,428
If there was a worse
player in the world

1072
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:15,862
Brad would still find a way
to lose to him.

1073
00:45:15,864 --> 00:45:17,862
Sorry, I don't have a chair,
but you're welcome to a drink.

1074
00:45:17,864 --> 00:45:19,929
No, I just came to
introduce you to, uh, Brad...

1075
00:45:19,931 --> 00:45:21,829
I'm all in. Calling it.

1076
00:45:21,831 --> 00:45:23,662
- Yeah, I call.
- Sorry.

1077
00:45:23,664 --> 00:45:25,296
I just wanted to introduce
you to Brad Marion.

1078
00:45:25,298 --> 00:45:27,029
- He wants to play.
- Give me his information.

1079
00:45:27,031 --> 00:45:28,996
- I'll check him out.
- Derek's gonna vouch for him.

1080
00:45:28,998 --> 00:45:31,163
"Derek's gonna vouch for him"
meant Derek would cover

1081
00:45:31,165 --> 00:45:34,866
any losses if Brad didn't pay,
up to any amount.

1082
00:45:37,565 --> 00:45:39,362
- Hi, I'm Molly Bloom.
- Brad Marion.

1083
00:45:39,364 --> 00:45:40,897
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

1084
00:45:40,899 --> 00:45:43,162
But he could pay and had to.

1085
00:45:43,164 --> 00:45:46,061
Because he embraced the fallacy
of being pot committed.

1086
00:45:46,063 --> 00:45:47,462
I'm all in.

1087
00:45:47,464 --> 00:45:49,030
You've already invested so much

1088
00:45:49,032 --> 00:45:52,530
you might as well see it
through to the end.

1089
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:55,061
Bad Brad had raised
$700 million

1090
00:45:55,063 --> 00:45:57,929
for a fund that traded
oil futures and every week

1091
00:45:57,931 --> 00:46:00,930
he came to the game,
lost a $100,000 and tipped me

1092
00:46:00,932 --> 00:46:03,930
five thousand so he could
play the next week.

1093
00:46:03,932 --> 00:46:06,163
He wasn't getting any better...

1094
00:46:06,165 --> 00:46:07,899
and the guys were
feasting on him.

1095
00:46:11,998 --> 00:46:14,062
Can I get another 50?

1096
00:46:14,064 --> 00:46:16,399
- Can we talk for a second?
- Sure.

1097
00:46:18,464 --> 00:46:19,796
Brad, this game might not
be for you.

1098
00:46:19,798 --> 00:46:21,997
I know I'm no card shark.

1099
00:46:21,999 --> 00:46:23,466
No, you're not.

1100
00:46:25,899 --> 00:46:28,061
Here are your losses
after ten weeks.

1101
00:46:28,063 --> 00:46:30,695
And you've won... never.

1102
00:46:30,697 --> 00:46:33,061
It's actually
a statistical anomaly.

1103
00:46:33,063 --> 00:46:34,532
Yeah. I know.

1104
00:46:35,732 --> 00:46:36,796
I like playing with the guys.

1105
00:46:36,798 --> 00:46:38,529
I don't have that many friends.

1106
00:46:38,531 --> 00:46:40,562
Don't take my seat away.

1107
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:41,863
I can tip you more.

1108
00:46:41,865 --> 00:46:43,396
No.

1109
00:46:43,398 --> 00:46:44,797
Your tips are very generous.

1110
00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:46,829
How about I-I get you
some books.

1111
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:49,428
Or even, even a pro
to give you lessons?

1112
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:51,995
Yeah, maybe.

1113
00:46:51,997 --> 00:46:54,595
- Yeah, let me think about it.
- Okay.

1114
00:46:54,597 --> 00:46:57,463
Turned out Bad Brad
knew what he was doing.

1115
00:46:57,465 --> 00:46:58,962
He was getting customers.

1116
00:46:58,964 --> 00:47:00,730
He'd drop his
100K at the game

1117
00:47:00,732 --> 00:47:02,797
and pick up four million
for his hedge fund.

1118
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:04,563
- Tell him what's smart...
- Not me.

1119
00:47:04,565 --> 00:47:06,530
More on that later, but first

1120
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,830
Harlan Eustice.

1121
00:47:07,832 --> 00:47:09,163
Player X said he met Harlan

1122
00:47:09,165 --> 00:47:10,530
at the Commerce Casino

1123
00:47:10,532 --> 00:47:11,995
and that he'd be
good for the game.

1124
00:47:11,997 --> 00:47:13,896
But I wasn't seeing
what he was seeing.

1125
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:17,762
He played tight, folding after
the hole cards 64% of the time.

1126
00:47:17,764 --> 00:47:19,796
It wasn't clear
where his money came from.

1127
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:21,830
He produced backyard
wrestling videos

1128
00:47:21,832 --> 00:47:23,729
and other low-rent productions.

1129
00:47:23,731 --> 00:47:25,029
But worst of all

1130
00:47:25,031 --> 00:47:27,629
Harlan Eustice
was a good card player.

1131
00:47:27,631 --> 00:47:30,762
Why would Player X want someone
at the game who could beat him?

1132
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,463
I learned the answer
to that one the hard way.

1133
00:47:33,465 --> 00:47:35,829
- How was your flight?
- Just fine.

1134
00:47:35,831 --> 00:47:38,029
How are you paying for tickets
between L.A. and New York?

1135
00:47:38,031 --> 00:47:40,061
I had two million points
left on my Amex.

1136
00:47:40,063 --> 00:47:41,662
They took the card,
but let me keep the points.

1137
00:47:41,664 --> 00:47:42,862
Which I thought
was nice of them.

1138
00:47:42,864 --> 00:47:45,163
- You had meetings.
- Hmm?

1139
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:47,263
You had meetings in L.A.
about your book and life rights.

1140
00:47:47,265 --> 00:47:48,495
- I did.
- Was there any interest?

1141
00:47:48,497 --> 00:47:49,995
A company that owns
four thousand

1142
00:47:49,997 --> 00:47:50,896
video poker machines

1143
00:47:50,898 --> 00:47:52,595
wants to put my face on them.

1144
00:47:52,597 --> 00:47:54,763
Anything else?

1145
00:47:54,765 --> 00:47:56,562
"Treat Magazine"
made a generous offer.

1146
00:47:56,564 --> 00:47:57,896
- "Treat?"
- It's a new magazine.

1147
00:47:57,898 --> 00:47:59,696
For the high-end
photography enthusiast.

1148
00:47:59,698 --> 00:48:01,796
- They want you to pose naked.
- I'd be the April treat.

1149
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:03,562
I meant interest in your book.

1150
00:48:03,564 --> 00:48:05,462
Ah, yeah.

1151
00:48:05,464 --> 00:48:08,396
- Any offers?
- A few, I guess.

1152
00:48:08,398 --> 00:48:10,428
Couple...

1153
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,463
Five.

1154
00:48:11,465 --> 00:48:12,830
- Really?
- Yeah.

1155
00:48:12,832 --> 00:48:14,428
- And...
- I passed.

1156
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:15,829
You're destitute
and you passed on

1157
00:48:15,831 --> 00:48:17,428
five offers to turn
your book into a movie.

1158
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:18,462
You will be paid, Charlie.

1159
00:48:18,464 --> 00:48:19,629
I'm just curious as to why

1160
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:20,797
you passed on
what would appear to be

1161
00:48:20,799 --> 00:48:22,730
the only way out you have.

1162
00:48:22,732 --> 00:48:23,929
Creative differences.

1163
00:48:23,931 --> 00:48:25,730
- Okay.
- Should we start?

1164
00:48:25,732 --> 00:48:27,830
You know, I am gonna
figure you out.

1165
00:48:27,832 --> 00:48:29,029
Well, let me know
what you find.

1166
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:32,428
You see this?
This is discovery.

1167
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:34,830
Let's see what we discovered.

1168
00:48:34,832 --> 00:48:37,629
Over here we have
Peter Druzhinsky

1169
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,362
Peter Antonovich
and Peter Slobo.

1170
00:48:40,364 --> 00:48:41,562
The three Petes.

1171
00:48:41,564 --> 00:48:42,695
Now the three Petes run a chain

1172
00:48:42,697 --> 00:48:44,162
of corrupt medical clinics

1173
00:48:44,164 --> 00:48:46,296
and have been committing
insurance fraud

1174
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:49,529
wire fraud and mail fraud
on an epic scale.

1175
00:48:49,531 --> 00:48:50,763
Now, over here we have

1176
00:48:50,765 --> 00:48:53,928
the Ragnyada-Gershen
Organization.

1177
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,061
They're a worldwide
bookmaking operation

1178
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,462
handling hundreds of millions
of dollars a year

1179
00:48:58,464 --> 00:49:00,061
in illegal sports betting.

1180
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:01,229
And over here, we have

1181
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:03,896
the Alexander-Habib
Organization.

1182
00:49:03,898 --> 00:49:06,595
This is also an illegal
sports betting organization.

1183
00:49:06,597 --> 00:49:09,663
But this one,
financed by an art gallery

1184
00:49:09,665 --> 00:49:13,095
owned by Shillel Habib,
who everyone calls...

1185
00:49:13,097 --> 00:49:14,565
Shelly.

1186
00:49:18,297 --> 00:49:22,463
This is the Russian Mafia
and the three are tied together

1187
00:49:22,465 --> 00:49:25,563
in the indictment through...

1188
00:49:25,565 --> 00:49:26,733
a poker game.

1189
00:49:27,863 --> 00:49:29,797
- Were they tapping my phones?
- No.

1190
00:49:29,799 --> 00:49:30,829
Thank God.

1191
00:49:30,831 --> 00:49:31,861
They were tapping the phones

1192
00:49:31,863 --> 00:49:33,162
of everyone you talked to.

1193
00:49:33,164 --> 00:49:34,529
Okay.

1194
00:49:34,531 --> 00:49:36,295
They got you confirming
that you ran raked games

1195
00:49:36,297 --> 00:49:38,928
at the Plaza Hotel and various
locations in New York.

1196
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,228
They've also got
a confidential informant

1197
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:43,961
confirming that you ran
raked games at the Plaza Hotel

1198
00:49:43,963 --> 00:49:45,730
and various locations
in New York.

1199
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:49,429
You were in violation of 1955,
which is a part of the U.S. Code

1200
00:49:49,431 --> 00:49:52,562
that makes it illegal to run
an illegal gambling business.

1201
00:49:52,564 --> 00:49:54,061
You know what you did?

1202
00:49:54,063 --> 00:49:56,395
You finished writing a book
before the good part happened.

1203
00:49:56,397 --> 00:49:59,029
You really get a kick out
of yourself, don't you?

1204
00:49:59,031 --> 00:50:01,029
You know,
I don't like this picture.

1205
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:02,662
- Thank you.
- You're like the cat...

1206
00:50:02,664 --> 00:50:03,829
That ate the canary
and then told

1207
00:50:03,831 --> 00:50:05,228
the canary's
parents about it.

1208
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:06,495
It's the picture
the publisher wanted

1209
00:50:06,497 --> 00:50:07,530
and I didn't get a vote.

1210
00:50:07,532 --> 00:50:08,929
I liked the book, good story.

1211
00:50:08,931 --> 00:50:10,295
- Well told.
- Thank you.

1212
00:50:10,297 --> 00:50:11,563
I need you to tell
it again, though.

1213
00:50:11,565 --> 00:50:12,696
From the beginning,
and this time

1214
00:50:12,698 --> 00:50:14,362
without skipping over
the Russians.

1215
00:50:14,364 --> 00:50:15,696
Would you
like a glass of water?

1216
00:50:15,698 --> 00:50:17,531
I'd like a glass of Bourbon.

1217
00:50:20,431 --> 00:50:22,495
- One more thing.
- Yeah?

1218
00:50:22,497 --> 00:50:23,861
I need your hard drives.

1219
00:50:23,863 --> 00:50:25,429
- Going back how far?
- What do you mean?

1220
00:50:25,431 --> 00:50:28,229
Well, I kept my hard drives
when I'd buy a new laptop.

1221
00:50:28,231 --> 00:50:29,396
- You're kidding.
- No.

1222
00:50:29,398 --> 00:50:30,696
It had a record of who owed what

1223
00:50:30,698 --> 00:50:31,729
and spreadsheets on the players.

1224
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:32,861
It has more than that.

1225
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,262
Every time you charge your phone

1226
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:35,829
by plugging it into the computer

1227
00:50:35,831 --> 00:50:37,263
the computer takes a record

1228
00:50:37,265 --> 00:50:39,129
of all your text messages
and emails.

1229
00:50:39,131 --> 00:50:41,596
My laptop has a record
of all text messages and emails

1230
00:50:41,598 --> 00:50:43,096
received years ago on phones

1231
00:50:43,098 --> 00:50:44,795
that have been smashed
with an aluminum bat?

1232
00:50:44,797 --> 00:50:47,861
I wanna run a forensic imaging
on your hard drives.

1233
00:50:47,863 --> 00:50:49,962
Oh, no. Thanks anyway, but I'll
be destroying those hard drives.

1234
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,695
No, you can't do that,
they're evidence.

1235
00:50:51,697 --> 00:50:53,129
I'm going to blow them up,
I am literally gonna use

1236
00:50:53,131 --> 00:50:54,730
explosives and scatter
the remains in the sea.

1237
00:50:54,732 --> 00:50:56,595
Except you told me they exist.

1238
00:50:56,597 --> 00:50:57,730
You're gonna have
to pretend I didn't tell you.

1239
00:50:57,732 --> 00:50:59,196
- Can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

1240
00:50:59,198 --> 00:51:00,296
You wanted a lawyer that

1241
00:51:00,298 --> 00:51:01,630
wasn't even a little bit shady.

1242
00:51:01,632 --> 00:51:02,795
New information
has come to light.

1243
00:51:02,797 --> 00:51:03,828
- I see that was stupid.
- Molly.

1244
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:05,163
There are no hard drives.

1245
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:06,862
If you destroy evidence
and obstruct justice

1246
00:51:06,864 --> 00:51:08,696
on top of the charges
already brought against you

1247
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:11,396
in this case, you will be,
I promise, incarcerated.

1248
00:51:11,398 --> 00:51:13,829
You don't understand
what's in those text messages.

1249
00:51:13,831 --> 00:51:15,762
I understand you've had
boyfriends and there'll be

1250
00:51:15,764 --> 00:51:17,796
some exchanges that are a little
bit, you know, embarrassing...

1251
00:51:17,798 --> 00:51:20,530
I don't care about embarrassing
text messages from boyfriends

1252
00:51:20,532 --> 00:51:22,296
as there is not left
the smallest corner

1253
00:51:22,298 --> 00:51:23,630
of my private life

1254
00:51:23,632 --> 00:51:25,928
that isn't available
for public scrutiny.

1255
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:28,729
There are messages that
would destroy other lives.

1256
00:51:28,731 --> 00:51:30,496
There are messages
that would end careers

1257
00:51:30,498 --> 00:51:31,996
and obliterate families.

1258
00:51:31,998 --> 00:51:34,729
If those the text messages
were to be made public...

1259
00:51:34,731 --> 00:51:36,128
- They won't be.
- If they were...

1260
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:38,463
- They won't be.
- It would be catastrophic.

1261
00:51:38,465 --> 00:51:39,896
- I'm a lawyer, I'm legally...
- No.

1262
00:51:39,898 --> 00:51:42,095
Listen to me,
I am legally prohibited

1263
00:51:42,097 --> 00:51:43,096
from disclosing anything...

1264
00:51:43,098 --> 00:51:44,529
Someone leaked
my last deposition

1265
00:51:44,531 --> 00:51:46,129
to the National Enquirer,
Charlie.

1266
00:51:46,131 --> 00:51:47,728
- Butterball?
- My last lawyer's name...

1267
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,728
Was Butterman
and he was one of five people

1268
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,562
in the room besides me.

1269
00:51:51,564 --> 00:51:53,095
But the information
in that deposition

1270
00:51:53,097 --> 00:51:55,596
will be nothing compared
to the consequences

1271
00:51:55,598 --> 00:51:57,129
of those text messages...

1272
00:51:57,131 --> 00:51:59,695
Ah! I just got it.

1273
00:51:59,697 --> 00:52:00,829
Showing up everywhere.

1274
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:02,428
I couldn't figure out why you

1275
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,263
named some people
but not others.

1276
00:52:04,265 --> 00:52:06,129
I thought that maybe
some people paid you.

1277
00:52:06,131 --> 00:52:07,996
You were wrong.
But doesn't matter.

1278
00:52:07,998 --> 00:52:10,128
No, the only people you named
in that book were the ones

1279
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:13,462
that were already named in
the Bad Brad Marion deposition.

1280
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:14,828
- Which you think...
- I know.

1281
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:16,095
- Somebody leaked it.
- Sold it.

1282
00:52:16,097 --> 00:52:17,429
- To the tabloids.
- Yes.

1283
00:52:17,431 --> 00:52:18,828
- Maybe even Butterbean.
- Butterman.

1284
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,162
But I don't know who it was.

1285
00:52:20,164 --> 00:52:21,429
I watched Jenny McCarthy

1286
00:52:21,431 --> 00:52:22,728
beat you up
for naming the players.

1287
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:23,828
Why didn't you just say,
"Hey, those names

1288
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:25,496
are already public record?"

1289
00:52:25,498 --> 00:52:28,429
I don't know. 'Cause I wasn't
on "The View" under subpoena.

1290
00:52:28,431 --> 00:52:30,529
Can we please get back
to the emails and texts?

1291
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:32,128
Is that why you have
creative differences

1292
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:33,163
with the Hollywood offers?

1293
00:52:33,165 --> 00:52:34,429
Because they want information

1294
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,596
and you won't give them.

1295
00:52:35,598 --> 00:52:36,630
- I don't know you.
- Hm.

1296
00:52:36,632 --> 00:52:37,662
If what happened last time

1297
00:52:37,664 --> 00:52:39,061
were to happen this time

1298
00:52:39,063 --> 00:52:41,329
it would make
what happened last time...

1299
00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:42,629
What is this for?

1300
00:52:42,631 --> 00:52:44,495
It's got every text message
and email

1301
00:52:44,497 --> 00:52:46,829
I sent in the last year
as well as a variety

1302
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:48,861
of incriminating evidence
about my clients.

1303
00:52:48,863 --> 00:52:50,463
Now if anything
of yours get leaked

1304
00:52:50,465 --> 00:52:52,861
you can sell my phone
to the highest bidder

1305
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:55,529
and I'll lose my job
and get disbarred.

1306
00:52:55,531 --> 00:52:57,395
So in order to demonstrate
the sanctity

1307
00:52:57,397 --> 00:52:59,462
of your attorney-client
confidentiality

1308
00:52:59,464 --> 00:53:01,463
you're betraying
the confidentiality

1309
00:53:01,465 --> 00:53:02,665
of all your other clients?

1310
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,263
I know you're not
gonna look at it.

1311
00:53:06,265 --> 00:53:08,029
How do you know?

1312
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:09,032
I don't know.

1313
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:17,029
I'll fly home to Colorado...

1314
00:53:17,031 --> 00:53:18,931
and be back the next day
with the hard drives.

1315
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:22,961
Harlan Eustice was excited

1316
00:53:22,963 --> 00:53:24,928
about the surprise
40th birthday party

1317
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:27,229
he was throwing for
his wife in 24 hours.

1318
00:53:27,231 --> 00:53:29,728
I rented out the whole
courtyard of the Buffalo Club.

1319
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:31,462
It'll be about a hundred people.

1320
00:53:31,464 --> 00:53:34,162
Kumamoto oysters,
snow crab, lobsters.

1321
00:53:34,164 --> 00:53:36,695
He wasn't taking off
menu items to show off.

1322
00:53:36,697 --> 00:53:38,462
He was genuinely excited
about the party

1323
00:53:38,464 --> 00:53:39,694
he was giving his wife.

1324
00:53:39,696 --> 00:53:40,862
She doesn't know
anything about it.

1325
00:53:40,864 --> 00:53:41,895
She thinks we're having dinner

1326
00:53:41,897 --> 00:53:44,563
with her brother and his wife.

1327
00:53:44,565 --> 00:53:46,061
I liked Harlan.

1328
00:53:46,063 --> 00:53:48,563
But nobody else liked him
except Player X.

1329
00:53:48,565 --> 00:53:50,329
- He played tight.
- Fold

1330
00:53:50,331 --> 00:53:51,862
Didn't give a lot of action

1331
00:53:51,864 --> 00:53:53,662
and always got
his money in good.

1332
00:53:53,664 --> 00:53:55,496
Which means he was
running the odds.

1333
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:57,295
- Five thousand to call.
- No.

1334
00:53:57,297 --> 00:53:59,828
In other words,
he was playing poker.

1335
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:01,564
And the others were gambling.

1336
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:05,465
And he won.

1337
00:54:06,731 --> 00:54:09,229
By midnight, Harlan had
tripled his original

1338
00:54:09,231 --> 00:54:11,228
fifty thousand dollar buy-in.

1339
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:14,296
But everything came off
the rails with one hand.

1340
00:54:14,298 --> 00:54:15,662
And that's how it happens.

1341
00:54:15,664 --> 00:54:17,662
That's how you go full-tilt.

1342
00:54:17,664 --> 00:54:19,962
Harlan, the best player
at the table

1343
00:54:19,964 --> 00:54:22,762
the best player at most
tables was about to get

1344
00:54:22,764 --> 00:54:25,594
bluffed off the win by,
of all people...

1345
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:28,295
Bad Brad. How?

1346
00:54:28,297 --> 00:54:30,995
Because Harlan had never
played with Brad before

1347
00:54:30,997 --> 00:54:34,829
and didn't know yet
that Brad was bad.

1348
00:54:34,831 --> 00:54:38,229
Harlan's got a boat.
9's full.

1349
00:54:38,231 --> 00:54:39,694
Brad's got nothing.

1350
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:41,262
But his pre-flop
betting made it look

1351
00:54:41,264 --> 00:54:43,828
entirely accidently,
like there was

1352
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:45,095
a chance he had pocket kings.

1353
00:54:45,097 --> 00:54:46,295
Twenty thousand.

1354
00:54:46,297 --> 00:54:47,628
Which if true

1355
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:50,296
would give him
the better full house.

1356
00:54:50,298 --> 00:54:53,195
Brad's counting off $20,000,
which means he's going to call

1357
00:54:53,197 --> 00:54:56,062
and Harlan knows that if
Brad's gonna call and not raise

1358
00:54:56,064 --> 00:54:57,728
it means he didn't
have the boat.

1359
00:54:57,730 --> 00:54:59,363
And he's betting
a high two pair.

1360
00:54:59,365 --> 00:55:01,694
Probably kings and queens.

1361
00:55:01,696 --> 00:55:03,494
But then instead
of calling the bet

1362
00:55:03,496 --> 00:55:05,862
Brad pushes $72,000
into the pot.

1363
00:55:05,864 --> 00:55:06,897
I'm all in.

1364
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:09,861
Harlan looks at Brad.

1365
00:55:09,863 --> 00:55:11,762
Every tell Harlan knows about

1366
00:55:11,764 --> 00:55:14,728
carotid artery pumping,
stiff hands...

1367
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:16,762
Brad's doing the opposite.

1368
00:55:16,764 --> 00:55:18,695
Brad's betting represented
a huge hand

1369
00:55:18,697 --> 00:55:20,129
by calling on the flop

1370
00:55:20,131 --> 00:55:22,462
check raising the turn
and bombing the river.

1371
00:55:22,464 --> 00:55:23,962
Of course, Harlan didn't know

1372
00:55:23,964 --> 00:55:26,728
that Brad didn't know
what any of that meant.

1373
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:29,263
So Harlan, always
a good sport said...

1374
00:55:29,265 --> 00:55:31,263
Nice bet. I'm laying this down.

1375
00:55:31,265 --> 00:55:35,562
As he tossed in what he
didn't realize was the winning hand

1376
00:55:35,564 --> 00:55:37,329
Brad tosses in his cards too

1377
00:55:37,331 --> 00:55:39,561
and one of them flips
over and Harlan sees...

1378
00:55:39,563 --> 00:55:42,662
You didn't have pocket kings?

1379
00:55:42,664 --> 00:55:43,695
I didn't have any kings

1380
00:55:43,697 --> 00:55:45,896
except the one in the middle.

1381
00:55:45,898 --> 00:55:49,029
- You had two pair?
- I had one pair.

1382
00:55:49,031 --> 00:55:50,432
The nines in the middle.

1383
00:55:58,930 --> 00:55:59,931
Thank you.

1384
00:56:02,264 --> 00:56:04,329
It wasn't even that
it was that much money.

1385
00:56:04,331 --> 00:56:07,461
Harlan only lost
about $40,000 on the hand.

1386
00:56:07,463 --> 00:56:08,895
But a circuit breaker blew

1387
00:56:08,897 --> 00:56:11,096
and Harlan was
out for blood now.

1388
00:56:11,098 --> 00:56:13,195
Everyone's.

1389
00:56:13,197 --> 00:56:15,594
We have a
$112,000 on the table.

1390
00:56:15,596 --> 00:56:17,229
You want another 50?

1391
00:56:17,231 --> 00:56:18,528
Give me another 100, please.

1392
00:56:21,531 --> 00:56:23,461
Sign here for a 100,000.

1393
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:26,363
By 5 a. m., Harlan
was down half a million.

1394
00:56:26,365 --> 00:56:28,494
He'd abandoned everything
he knew about poker

1395
00:56:28,496 --> 00:56:29,961
and was playing
like a frat kid

1396
00:56:29,963 --> 00:56:32,597
swinging for a home run
on every hand.

1397
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:37,229
- Another 100 please.
- Hey, bud...

1398
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:39,032
Molly, please. Let's go.

1399
00:56:40,696 --> 00:56:42,165
Sign here for a 100.

1400
00:56:51,664 --> 00:56:54,163
Text messages were going
out letting everyone know

1401
00:56:54,165 --> 00:56:55,661
Harlan was bleeding.

1402
00:56:55,663 --> 00:56:56,729
Guys were coming by to play

1403
00:56:56,731 --> 00:56:58,295
for a couple hours before work.

1404
00:56:58,297 --> 00:57:00,295
They'd been losing
to him for months.

1405
00:57:00,297 --> 00:57:02,661
Everyone wanted a check
from Harlan Eustice.

1406
00:57:02,663 --> 00:57:03,862
If you go home now you can have

1407
00:57:03,864 --> 00:57:06,262
a few hours sleep
before Sheila's party.

1408
00:57:06,264 --> 00:57:07,430
Soon.

1409
00:57:08,964 --> 00:57:10,528
Come talk to me.

1410
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:12,664
Hi, guys.
Help yourself to some coffee.

1411
00:57:17,364 --> 00:57:19,196
You're on tilt.

1412
00:57:19,198 --> 00:57:20,529
Everybody knows it.

1413
00:57:20,531 --> 00:57:21,595
You're playing
without the weapons

1414
00:57:21,597 --> 00:57:22,798
you need to win.

1415
00:57:23,563 --> 00:57:24,765
You're right.

1416
00:57:25,664 --> 00:57:26,898
Alright, thank you.

1417
00:57:27,664 --> 00:57:29,464
Just give me $500,000.

1418
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:32,762
I just gotta get back to even.

1419
00:57:32,764 --> 00:57:34,196
That should be the second line

1420
00:57:34,198 --> 00:57:35,895
of every gambler's obit.

1421
00:57:35,897 --> 00:57:39,594
Mr. Feldstein died while
trying to get back to even.

1422
00:57:39,596 --> 00:57:40,761
Harlan never did.

1423
00:57:40,763 --> 00:57:42,028
And he never got to his wife's

1424
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:43,263
birthday party.

1425
00:57:43,265 --> 00:57:45,861
She filed for divorce
two days later.

1426
00:57:45,863 --> 00:57:48,129
There was one last punch coming

1427
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,132
that would put Harlan
on the floor for good.

1428
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:54,163
Harlan was heads up against
a guy named Frederick

1429
00:57:54,165 --> 00:57:55,865
who was Austrian royalty.

1430
00:57:57,898 --> 00:57:58,761
Call.

1431
00:57:58,763 --> 00:58:00,562
Harlan had pocket queens.

1432
00:58:00,564 --> 00:58:02,929
His Excellency had ace king.

1433
00:58:02,931 --> 00:58:06,129
They were both in 65K pre-flop.

1434
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:07,595
Flops queen seven-seven.

1435
00:58:07,597 --> 00:58:09,162
Harlan has a full house again.

1436
00:58:09,164 --> 00:58:10,896
Queens full of sevens.

1437
00:58:10,898 --> 00:58:13,494
With three rounds of betting
in front of him...

1438
00:58:13,496 --> 00:58:15,131
the Count has nothing.

1439
00:58:18,564 --> 00:58:20,928
- All in.
- And the Count goes all in.

1440
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,328
He wants Harlan
to think he's got

1441
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:23,528
two more sevens under there.

1442
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:25,163
- Call.
- "Nope," says Harlan.

1443
00:58:25,165 --> 00:58:28,494
He's not falling for this again
and he snap calls all in.

1444
00:58:28,496 --> 00:58:31,132
There's $750,000 on the table.

1445
00:58:32,597 --> 00:58:36,096
Diego burns a card
and deals a turn.

1446
00:58:36,098 --> 00:58:39,695
A king. Otto Von Bismarck
now has two pair.

1447
00:58:39,697 --> 00:58:41,662
Kings and sevens.

1448
00:58:41,664 --> 00:58:44,162
But two pair is nothing
next to a full house.

1449
00:58:44,164 --> 00:58:45,461
And at this point

1450
00:58:45,463 --> 00:58:46,661
the only hand left that can

1451
00:58:46,663 --> 00:58:48,430
beat a queen full house...

1452
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:51,564
is a king full house.

1453
00:58:52,997 --> 00:58:56,195
Captain Von Trapp
bluffed two pair

1454
00:58:56,197 --> 00:58:58,530
and rivered into kings full.

1455
00:58:59,563 --> 00:59:02,594
Motherfucker!

1456
00:59:02,596 --> 00:59:04,695
- Fuck you, fucking mechanic.
- Hey!

1457
00:59:04,697 --> 00:59:06,728
Fuck you, you bottom-dealing
party magician!

1458
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:08,196
Hey! Get out on the terrace.

1459
00:59:08,198 --> 00:59:09,962
You've been pulling this shit
on me for two days!

1460
00:59:09,964 --> 00:59:12,165
- Come on, come on.
- Party magician.

1461
00:59:14,296 --> 00:59:16,165
- You good?
- I'm okay, thanks.

1462
00:59:21,697 --> 00:59:23,528
What the hell?

1463
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:26,295
I'll apologize to Diego.

1464
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:28,262
Yeah. And you're gonna go home.

1465
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:29,931
I'm making a floor call,
that's it.

1466
00:59:31,596 --> 00:59:32,764
Did you hear me?

1467
00:59:34,063 --> 00:59:35,530
I don't have it.

1468
00:59:39,264 --> 00:59:40,732
A million two.

1469
00:59:41,597 --> 00:59:42,831
I don't have it.

1470
00:59:46,429 --> 00:59:47,731
I'm sorry.

1471
00:59:55,831 --> 00:59:57,098
Go home.

1472
00:59:59,197 --> 01:00:00,697
I'm very sorry.

1473
01:00:03,497 --> 01:00:06,165
You got to tell
Sheila the truth, okay?

1474
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:10,294
Tell her the truth.
Tell her what happened.

1475
01:00:10,296 --> 01:00:14,128
And I'm gonna help you.
I'm gonna get you to a meeting.

1476
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:16,828
We'll meet tomorrow
and figure out

1477
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:18,664
what to do about the money.

1478
01:00:32,296 --> 01:00:34,128
Harlan and I
didn't meet the next day.

1479
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,028
He just called me
and said everything was okay

1480
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:37,829
and showed up the next week
with a bank check

1481
01:00:37,831 --> 01:00:40,161
for a million, two hundred
thousand dollars.

1482
01:00:40,163 --> 01:00:42,561
Where did he
get the money from?

1483
01:00:42,563 --> 01:00:44,461
- I loaned it to him.
- Loaned it?

1484
01:00:44,463 --> 01:00:46,762
I get 50% of his wins
until the debt's paid off.

1485
01:00:46,764 --> 01:00:50,227
And then fifty percent for the
next two years with no exposure.

1486
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,896
You're getting 50% of the wins.

1487
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,828
- And no exposure on the losses?
- Yeah.

1488
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:56,562
First of all, he'll never
climb out of that.

1489
01:00:56,564 --> 01:00:58,494
That's sharecropper math.

1490
01:00:58,496 --> 01:01:01,162
It's also usury.
It's racketeering.

1491
01:01:01,164 --> 01:01:03,161
Second, you can't
stake a player

1492
01:01:03,163 --> 01:01:04,861
and play in the game
at the same time.

1493
01:01:04,863 --> 01:01:07,494
I've been doing it
for two years.

1494
01:01:07,496 --> 01:01:09,964
- You've been staking Harlan?
- Yeah.

1495
01:01:11,197 --> 01:01:13,862
- Jesus Christ.
- It's not cheating.

1496
01:01:13,864 --> 01:01:15,128
It creates
the opportunity for it.

1497
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,862
- Tell me how.
- Are you kidding me?

1498
01:01:16,864 --> 01:01:18,695
- Tell me how!
- You've interest in another...

1499
01:01:18,697 --> 01:01:19,828
You think I'm going
to take a dive?

1500
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:21,694
And if I did, who would care?

1501
01:01:21,696 --> 01:01:22,961
You fold your hole cards.

1502
01:01:22,963 --> 01:01:24,662
Five of clubs,
and a jack of hearts.

1503
01:01:24,664 --> 01:01:25,694
He's still in the game.

1504
01:01:25,696 --> 01:01:27,095
It would benefit him to know

1505
01:01:27,097 --> 01:01:28,127
that the five of clubs...

1506
01:01:28,129 --> 01:01:29,161
You think I'm signaling him?

1507
01:01:29,163 --> 01:01:30,194
I'm saying it can't

1508
01:01:30,196 --> 01:01:31,664
fucking happen again.

1509
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:42,062
- You disapprove of me.
- It's not personal.

1510
01:01:42,064 --> 01:01:43,694
It feels personal
when you chat up

1511
01:01:43,696 --> 01:01:45,362
every other guy
at the game except me.

1512
01:01:45,364 --> 01:01:47,762
When you stay late for a drink
with J.T. but never...

1513
01:01:47,764 --> 01:01:49,427
Have you visited his Oscar?

1514
01:01:49,429 --> 01:01:51,662
I think it's bolted
on the hood of his car.

1515
01:01:51,664 --> 01:01:54,028
It's noticeable,
when you go out of your way

1516
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:55,729
to demonstrate that you
have no interest in me.

1517
01:01:55,731 --> 01:01:57,595
You did the same thing to Dean.

1518
01:01:57,597 --> 01:01:59,562
These guys want to play cards
with me, not you!

1519
01:01:59,564 --> 01:02:00,996
Be that as it may...

1520
01:02:00,998 --> 01:02:02,695
You know who the biggest
winner in this game is?

1521
01:02:02,697 --> 01:02:03,761
- It's you.
- You know who...

1522
01:02:03,763 --> 01:02:04,861
The second biggest winner is?

1523
01:02:04,863 --> 01:02:06,564
- Look...
- It's you.

1524
01:02:07,998 --> 01:02:09,929
What are you taking home,
10,000 a night now?

1525
01:02:09,931 --> 01:02:11,961
That is my business,
literally.

1526
01:02:11,963 --> 01:02:14,028
Between you, the dealers
and the servers

1527
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,796
you're taking a lot of money
out of this game.

1528
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:17,462
Not as much
as I'm bringing to it.

1529
01:02:17,464 --> 01:02:18,795
That 10,000 is 10,000

1530
01:02:18,797 --> 01:02:20,228
that doesn't go in my pocket.

1531
01:02:20,230 --> 01:02:21,594
Again, my money is...

1532
01:02:21,596 --> 01:02:24,428
Your money is my money.

1533
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:26,428
Is it?

1534
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:28,897
I think we should talk
about capping your tips.

1535
01:02:31,963 --> 01:02:33,662
You want to get together
with the other players

1536
01:02:33,664 --> 01:02:37,095
who on my tax returns,
are called clients

1537
01:02:37,097 --> 01:02:39,227
and discuss putting
a ceiling on my wages?

1538
01:02:39,229 --> 01:02:41,161
That's right.

1539
01:02:41,163 --> 01:02:44,898
It'll be America's most closely
watched anti-trust case.

1540
01:02:46,497 --> 01:02:47,862
Right there, right then

1541
01:02:47,864 --> 01:02:51,061
that fast, I lost the game.

1542
01:02:51,063 --> 01:02:53,327
It was the next Tuesday,
game night.

1543
01:02:53,329 --> 01:02:56,394
He waited until he knew
I'd be on the way to the hotel

1544
01:02:56,396 --> 01:02:57,997
and then sent me a text.

1545
01:03:03,063 --> 01:03:04,828
It said, "We're playing
at Dave's tonight.

1546
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:06,194
No need to show up."

1547
01:03:06,196 --> 01:03:08,328
And I knew the truth
even before I answered

1548
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:09,965
the call that came next.

1549
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:18,327
You are so fucked.

1550
01:03:31,996 --> 01:03:34,094
There's no such word
as verticality.

1551
01:03:34,096 --> 01:03:36,995
- Hmm?
- In the book, on page 152.

1552
01:03:36,997 --> 01:03:39,328
"When you lose the game in L.A.
and come to New York

1553
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:41,395
you admire
the city's verticality."

1554
01:03:41,397 --> 01:03:42,428
It's a word.

1555
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:43,561
Once you're in New York

1556
01:03:43,563 --> 01:03:44,595
you talk about games

1557
01:03:44,597 --> 01:03:46,694
lasting all night, two nights.

1558
01:03:46,696 --> 01:03:50,462
Bein' up for days,
but you don't mention drugs.

1559
01:03:50,464 --> 01:03:51,928
There were drugs.
I'm two years clean.

1560
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:53,495
But you left the drugs
out of the book.

1561
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:55,562
You know what?
I'm not paying you $250,000

1562
01:03:55,564 --> 01:03:56,796
for your Amazon
customer review.

1563
01:03:56,798 --> 01:03:58,994
So far, you're not
paying me for anything.

1564
01:03:58,996 --> 01:04:00,695
I just emailed you
verticality

1565
01:04:00,697 --> 01:04:02,994
from Merriam-Webster's
Dictionary.

1566
01:04:02,996 --> 01:04:05,498
What's an advance
on a book like this?

1567
01:04:06,564 --> 01:04:08,698
The advance?

1568
01:04:10,364 --> 01:04:11,662
It depends.

1569
01:04:11,664 --> 01:04:13,361
If you guarantee the publishers

1570
01:04:13,363 --> 01:04:14,561
certain elements

1571
01:04:14,563 --> 01:04:16,528
then I can get you
a million and a half.

1572
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:18,095
Which you'd probably
double on sales

1573
01:04:18,097 --> 01:04:19,362
plus ancillary rights.

1574
01:04:19,364 --> 01:04:20,729
What kind of elements?

1575
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:23,728
- You have to use real names.
- Eli...

1576
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:25,929
There's a guy who sits
outside my Starbucks

1577
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:28,395
with a, uh,
with a cardboard sign

1578
01:04:28,397 --> 01:04:29,861
that says "Vietnam Vet."

1579
01:04:29,863 --> 01:04:31,729
And every morning,
I give him a quarter.

1580
01:04:31,731 --> 01:04:33,694
And right now,
the only difference

1581
01:04:33,696 --> 01:04:35,060
between you and him

1582
01:04:35,062 --> 01:04:36,662
is that you have
a story.

1583
01:04:36,664 --> 01:04:38,361
I'm one thousand
percent sure that

1584
01:04:38,363 --> 01:04:40,162
the homeless Vietnam vet
has a better one.

1585
01:04:40,164 --> 01:04:41,896
You have one asset.

1586
01:04:41,898 --> 01:04:43,494
Write your story
and I can get you

1587
01:04:43,496 --> 01:04:45,896
a million and a half,
and-and that's the floor.

1588
01:04:45,898 --> 01:04:47,796
Go big or go home

1589
01:04:47,798 --> 01:04:49,227
and live with your mother.

1590
01:04:49,229 --> 01:04:50,897
For the rest of your life.

1591
01:04:54,197 --> 01:04:55,665
What if I...

1592
01:04:58,264 --> 01:04:59,529
What if I told the publishers

1593
01:04:59,531 --> 01:05:02,694
that I-I would name the players

1594
01:05:02,696 --> 01:05:05,327
who are already named in
the Brad Marion Deposition?

1595
01:05:05,329 --> 01:05:06,597
All four?

1596
01:05:07,798 --> 01:05:09,495
I'll use the real names
of the players

1597
01:05:09,497 --> 01:05:11,328
who are already
named by Bad Brad.

1598
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:12,995
- What if I told them that?
- You spent eight years...

1599
01:05:12,997 --> 01:05:14,695
In Hollywood and
two years in New York

1600
01:05:14,697 --> 01:05:16,061
running the world's
most exclusive

1601
01:05:16,063 --> 01:05:18,327
glamorous and decadent
man cave.

1602
01:05:18,329 --> 01:05:19,895
So what do the
publishers get from you

1603
01:05:19,897 --> 01:05:21,897
about people with real names?

1604
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:26,164
My advance was $35,000.

1605
01:05:27,863 --> 01:05:29,227
Well, the first thing
I'm gonna do is

1606
01:05:29,229 --> 01:05:30,795
get you a minor role reduction.

1607
01:05:30,797 --> 01:05:32,628
Get the 12 points
knocked down to ten.

1608
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:34,294
- What's a minor role reduction?
- I'm going to argue...

1609
01:05:34,296 --> 01:05:36,927
To the prosecutor that you're,
uh, an employee that was

1610
01:05:36,929 --> 01:05:38,595
hired and fired
by the players.

1611
01:05:38,597 --> 01:05:40,994
- Not a chance.
- I think we got a good chance.

1612
01:05:40,996 --> 01:05:42,594
No, not a chance I'm letting
you make that argument.

1613
01:05:42,596 --> 01:05:44,928
- Why not?
- It's not true.

1614
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:46,362
Let me explain how
the point system works.

1615
01:05:46,364 --> 01:05:47,694
I know how it works.

1616
01:05:47,696 --> 01:05:49,694
Points correspond
with the prosecutor's

1617
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:51,127
sentencing recommendation.

1618
01:05:51,129 --> 01:05:52,327
You try to get a point reduction

1619
01:05:52,329 --> 01:05:53,629
based on a variety of factors

1620
01:05:53,631 --> 01:05:55,828
including, say,
prior criminal history

1621
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:57,861
which I don't have,
or whether the defendant

1622
01:05:57,863 --> 01:05:59,795
played a minor role,
which I certainly did not.

1623
01:05:59,797 --> 01:06:01,528
You really think this is
a good time to hog credit?

1624
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:02,795
- I built it from scratch.
- No.

1625
01:06:02,797 --> 01:06:04,060
There was already a game
at the Cobra Lounge

1626
01:06:04,062 --> 01:06:05,128
when you came along.

1627
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:06,661
The New York game is
what I'm talking about.

1628
01:06:06,663 --> 01:06:08,094
I built from scratch.

1629
01:06:08,096 --> 01:06:09,261
I wasn't fireable.

1630
01:06:09,263 --> 01:06:10,295
I made sure of that.

1631
01:06:10,297 --> 01:06:11,598
So, no.

1632
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:13,827
I wasn't really listening.

1633
01:06:13,829 --> 01:06:15,561
I'm refusing you permission

1634
01:06:15,563 --> 01:06:16,894
to seek a minor role reduction.

1635
01:06:16,896 --> 01:06:18,328
I'm refusing you permission

1636
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:19,861
to invalidate
my entire career.

1637
01:06:19,863 --> 01:06:22,127
- And I'm not caring.
- I built a successful...

1638
01:06:22,129 --> 01:06:23,630
Hey, do you want kids?

1639
01:06:25,463 --> 01:06:27,495
You interested
in having a family?

1640
01:06:27,497 --> 01:06:28,960
Very much.

1641
01:06:28,962 --> 01:06:30,628
I don't get you
some point reductions

1642
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:32,294
and the sentencing
recommendation guidelines

1643
01:06:32,296 --> 01:06:33,694
say eight to twelve years.

1644
01:06:33,696 --> 01:06:35,362
And that's before they
try to jam you up

1645
01:06:35,364 --> 01:06:36,927
more for money laundering.

1646
01:06:36,929 --> 01:06:39,162
The moment you changed the
Russian's money for chips...

1647
01:06:39,164 --> 01:06:40,927
I would've had to been aware
where the money was...

1648
01:06:40,929 --> 01:06:42,961
Find me twelve men and women
who'll believe

1649
01:06:42,963 --> 01:06:44,961
that you weren't aware
of exactly who was sitting

1650
01:06:44,963 --> 01:06:46,594
at your table
and where the money came from.

1651
01:06:46,596 --> 01:06:48,228
So, that's it.

1652
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:50,530
You were a cocktail waitress.

1653
01:06:55,297 --> 01:06:59,662
When I lost the L.A. game,
I told myself it was no big deal.

1654
01:06:59,664 --> 01:07:01,662
It was just supposed
to be an adventure

1655
01:07:01,664 --> 01:07:04,130
and a way to meet
influential people.

1656
01:07:05,862 --> 01:07:08,697
And I'd saved over $200,000.

1657
01:07:10,363 --> 01:07:13,061
But that was just a weak
firewall I'd hastily built

1658
01:07:13,063 --> 01:07:15,529
to keep out the humiliation
and depression

1659
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:16,996
I knew was coming.

1660
01:07:20,796 --> 01:07:22,630
It had to end sometime.

1661
01:07:23,929 --> 01:07:26,163
I just thought
it would be on my time.

1662
01:07:27,596 --> 01:07:30,394
The game had given me
an identity

1663
01:07:30,396 --> 01:07:32,860
respect and a defined place

1664
01:07:32,862 --> 01:07:35,861
in a world
that was inaccessible.

1665
01:07:35,863 --> 01:07:39,430
And in one irrational
heartbeat, it was taken away.

1666
01:07:41,463 --> 01:07:43,662
I was irrelevant...

1667
01:07:43,664 --> 01:07:45,797
and forgotten, overnight.

1668
01:07:49,129 --> 01:07:52,127
It'd been two weeks
since I lost the game...

1669
01:07:52,129 --> 01:07:54,095
and I made an appointment
to see someone.

1670
01:07:54,097 --> 01:07:56,860
Because now,
the humiliation and depression

1671
01:07:56,862 --> 01:07:58,827
had given way
to a blinding anger

1672
01:07:58,829 --> 01:08:02,497
at my powerlessness
over the unfair whims of men.

1673
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:07,361
It was that
there weren't any rules.

1674
01:08:07,363 --> 01:08:10,629
These power moves weren't
framed by right and wrong.

1675
01:08:10,631 --> 01:08:12,795
Just ego and vanity.

1676
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:15,528
Selfish whims with
no regard for consequence.

1677
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:17,294
No fairness, no justice.

1678
01:08:17,296 --> 01:08:20,094
And that giggling,
cackling call from Player X.

1679
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,961
You're so fucked.

1680
01:08:21,963 --> 01:08:23,960
I couldn't lose to that
green-screened little shit.

1681
01:08:23,962 --> 01:08:25,262
And I didn't want a therapist

1682
01:08:25,264 --> 01:08:27,894
to make me feel okay about it.

1683
01:08:27,896 --> 01:08:30,860
You know what makes you feel
okay about losing?

1684
01:08:30,862 --> 01:08:32,629
Winning.

1685
01:08:32,631 --> 01:08:34,494
I got on a plane to New York.

1686
01:08:36,829 --> 01:08:39,227
Wall Street. Madison Avenue.

1687
01:08:39,229 --> 01:08:41,528
Fifth Avenue. The Dakota.

1688
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:42,761
The San Remo.

1689
01:08:42,763 --> 01:08:44,295
The players were here.

1690
01:08:44,297 --> 01:08:46,161
I just had to bait the hook.

1691
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:49,662
This time,
I didn't have movie stars.

1692
01:08:49,664 --> 01:08:52,494
This time,
I used Playboy Playmates.

1693
01:08:52,496 --> 01:08:54,795
These weren't
just any Playmates.

1694
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,794
Jesse was
a Puerto Rican knockout

1695
01:08:56,796 --> 01:08:58,561
who grew up working
in card rooms

1696
01:08:58,563 --> 01:09:00,660
and was a good player herself.

1697
01:09:00,662 --> 01:09:02,961
I could stake her,
infiltrate other games

1698
01:09:02,963 --> 01:09:05,361
and poach
their big ticket players.

1699
01:09:05,363 --> 01:09:06,827
Shelby could write code

1700
01:09:06,829 --> 01:09:08,629
and run more thorough
background checks

1701
01:09:08,631 --> 01:09:11,194
than the T.S.A.

1702
01:09:11,196 --> 01:09:14,161
Winston was the daughter
of an American diplomat.

1703
01:09:14,163 --> 01:09:15,628
She's lived in nine
different countries

1704
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:17,428
and had the email addresses

1705
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:19,828
of half
the Saudi Royal Family.

1706
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:21,693
Who's the biggest
game in Manhattan?

1707
01:09:21,695 --> 01:09:25,162
On any given night, it's either
Teddy Chin or Tutti Toscano.

1708
01:09:25,164 --> 01:09:27,328
- But that's Manhattan.
- What do you mean?

1709
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,461
Biggest game in New York
is in Brooklyn.

1710
01:09:29,463 --> 01:09:30,928
Russian Jews.

1711
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:31,761
Buy-in's a 100k.

1712
01:09:31,763 --> 01:09:32,994
No one runs the game.

1713
01:09:32,996 --> 01:09:34,760
They just play and pay.

1714
01:09:34,762 --> 01:09:36,694
We couldn't promise anyone
they'd rub elbows

1715
01:09:36,696 --> 01:09:38,162
with movie stars.

1716
01:09:38,164 --> 01:09:39,228
But New York has one thing

1717
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:40,361
Hollywood doesn't.

1718
01:09:40,363 --> 01:09:41,795
The Yankees.

1719
01:09:41,797 --> 01:09:43,528
And there was one
Yankee in particular

1720
01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:44,828
that every man in America

1721
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:46,261
would line up to lose to.

1722
01:09:46,263 --> 01:09:47,595
Don't say his name out loud.

1723
01:09:47,597 --> 01:09:49,327
Write it on a cocktail napkin.

1724
01:09:49,329 --> 01:09:50,529
Crumple up the napkin up.

1725
01:09:50,531 --> 01:09:51,894
Put it in a glass of water

1726
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,461
so they can see
the ink dissolve.

1727
01:09:53,463 --> 01:09:54,794
- That's really necessary?
- No.

1728
01:09:54,796 --> 01:09:56,295
It's not at all necessary.

1729
01:09:56,297 --> 01:09:57,327
When do we tell them the game

1730
01:09:57,329 --> 01:09:58,628
is going to start?

1731
01:09:58,630 --> 01:09:59,828
Tell them it's been happening

1732
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:01,995
once a week for about six months

1733
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:04,427
at a location you won't
disclose right now.

1734
01:10:04,429 --> 01:10:06,127
There's a pretty long
waiting list for a chair

1735
01:10:06,129 --> 01:10:08,728
but Molly's here somewhere

1736
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:10,461
and I'll introduce you to her.

1737
01:10:10,463 --> 01:10:12,660
50K buy-in,
blinds are five and one?

1738
01:10:12,662 --> 01:10:14,797
Yeah, fifty...

1739
01:10:18,196 --> 01:10:19,228
Mol?

1740
01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:20,860
50K buy-in?

1741
01:10:20,862 --> 01:10:23,894
No, 250.

1742
01:10:23,896 --> 01:10:25,529
That's going to make noise.

1743
01:10:25,531 --> 01:10:28,164
Enough to be
heard on Rodeo Drive.

1744
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,761
The Gold Coast of Long Island

1745
01:10:33,763 --> 01:10:35,395
has been home
to the Vanderbilts

1746
01:10:35,397 --> 01:10:36,728
Roosevelts, Whitneys

1747
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:39,195
J.P. Morgan
and F.W. Woolworth.

1748
01:10:39,197 --> 01:10:42,628
It's an impossible ticket
to get, but I can talk to Molly.

1749
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:45,394
Tonight was a $10,000
per person fundraiser

1750
01:10:45,396 --> 01:10:46,693
to pay for major renovations

1751
01:10:46,695 --> 01:10:48,395
at the East Hampton Yacht Club.

1752
01:10:48,397 --> 01:10:49,861
Molly's around here somewhere.

1753
01:10:49,863 --> 01:10:51,761
I could introduce you, but I
wouldn't get my hopes up.

1754
01:10:51,763 --> 01:10:52,860
That's for real.

1755
01:10:52,862 --> 01:10:53,961
There was a charity event

1756
01:10:53,963 --> 01:10:55,428
for residents of the Hamptons

1757
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:56,529
who own yachts.

1758
01:10:56,531 --> 01:10:57,694
In my business, that's called

1759
01:10:57,696 --> 01:10:59,060
a target-rich environment.

1760
01:10:59,062 --> 01:11:01,895
I have to tell you
the initial buy-in is $250,000.

1761
01:11:01,897 --> 01:11:05,431
$250,000? That's almost as much
as my second car.

1762
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:08,362
Your friends come to the games?

1763
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:09,628
Mm-hm.

1764
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:10,694
It took only 7 weeks

1765
01:11:10,696 --> 01:11:12,228
of recruiting to get 10 players

1766
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:14,094
and 7 on a waiting list.

1767
01:11:14,096 --> 01:11:15,395
And in these circles

1768
01:11:15,397 --> 01:11:16,427
that was more than enough

1769
01:11:16,429 --> 01:11:18,561
to start the mythology.

1770
01:11:18,563 --> 01:11:20,462
By morning,
gamblers would be telling

1771
01:11:20,464 --> 01:11:23,027
and hearing stories
about this game in London

1772
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:25,261
Tokyo and Dubai.

1773
01:11:25,263 --> 01:11:26,327
At the end of that year

1774
01:11:26,329 --> 01:11:27,461
I reported an income

1775
01:11:27,463 --> 01:11:31,262
of $4,773,000.

1776
01:11:31,264 --> 01:11:34,861
Every square inch of it
legal and on the books.

1777
01:11:34,863 --> 01:11:37,494
I was the biggest game runner
in the world.

1778
01:11:37,496 --> 01:11:38,827
All tips.

1779
01:11:38,829 --> 01:11:40,362
I still hadn't taken a rake

1780
01:11:40,364 --> 01:11:42,627
and I still hadn't accidentally
recruited members

1781
01:11:42,629 --> 01:11:44,861
of a Russian crime syndicate.

1782
01:11:44,863 --> 01:11:47,661
In the beginning, I was using
drugs to stay awake.

1783
01:11:47,663 --> 01:11:49,895
First Adderall,
then Adderall crushed up

1784
01:11:49,897 --> 01:11:51,827
to defeat the time release.

1785
01:11:51,829 --> 01:11:53,827
Then coke, Valium, Vicodin

1786
01:11:53,829 --> 01:11:55,493
Percocet and more Adderall.

1787
01:11:55,495 --> 01:11:58,428
I rented a penthouse apartment
and installed plasma screens

1788
01:11:58,430 --> 01:12:00,162
for the sports bettors.

1789
01:12:00,164 --> 01:12:02,060
I had the lower stakes
games on Wednesdays

1790
01:12:02,062 --> 01:12:04,028
Thursdays and Sundays
at my place

1791
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:06,760
with Tuesday night at
the Plaza being the big game.

1792
01:12:06,762 --> 01:12:08,195
At 7:00, the dealers came

1793
01:12:08,197 --> 01:12:09,927
and the table was set up
and polished

1794
01:12:09,929 --> 01:12:11,494
and ten chairs
were placed around it

1795
01:12:11,496 --> 01:12:13,927
exactly 12 inches apart.

1796
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:15,894
I used custom chips
and two dealers

1797
01:12:15,896 --> 01:12:18,028
who worked an hour on,
an hour off

1798
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:21,262
with a new crew coming in
after 12 hours.

1799
01:12:21,264 --> 01:12:23,095
Casinos had discovered
that certain scents

1800
01:12:23,097 --> 01:12:25,460
make people more likely
to place big bets.

1801
01:12:25,462 --> 01:12:28,728
The Casinos pump those scents
in through the ventilation.

1802
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:31,961
I had custom candles made.

1803
01:12:31,963 --> 01:12:34,294
I'd been working
with a new dealer named "B."

1804
01:12:34,296 --> 01:12:37,095
Not like Beatrice,
just the initial.

1805
01:12:37,097 --> 01:12:38,895
She'd been working in
trashy card rooms

1806
01:12:38,897 --> 01:12:41,098
on the East Side
and we became friends.

1807
01:12:42,329 --> 01:12:43,628
Tone it down.

1808
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:45,931
The big players
don't like fast hands.

1809
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:51,760
Sarcastic dealing, cool.

1810
01:12:51,762 --> 01:12:54,760
You got to do it,
not doing it is insanity.

1811
01:12:54,762 --> 01:12:56,561
You must be able to see that.

1812
01:12:56,563 --> 01:12:58,994
You've been stiffed four
or five times.

1813
01:12:58,996 --> 01:13:01,494
You've got hundreds of thousands
on the street.

1814
01:13:01,496 --> 01:13:03,961
That's money you're
never gonna see again.

1815
01:13:03,963 --> 01:13:07,528
B had been suggesting
it for a long time.

1816
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:08,827
She was suggesting it again

1817
01:13:08,829 --> 01:13:10,395
because of an incident
the week before.

1818
01:13:10,397 --> 01:13:11,761
- Hey, Cole.
- Hey.

1819
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:14,394
- Come on in.
- Thanks, you got my check?

1820
01:13:14,396 --> 01:13:16,361
I do.

1821
01:13:16,363 --> 01:13:17,693
- It's right here.
- Thank you.

1822
01:13:17,695 --> 01:13:19,094
Hey can I show you
something on TV?

1823
01:13:19,096 --> 01:13:22,028
Umm, actually,
I'm in kinda a hurry.

1824
01:13:22,030 --> 01:13:23,864
It'll just take a second.
Have a seat.

1825
01:13:26,829 --> 01:13:29,426
This is last Tuesday's game.

1826
01:13:29,428 --> 01:13:31,261
Shit, Molly,
if the guys find out

1827
01:13:31,263 --> 01:13:34,162
you've got cameras on them,
they're gonna go nuts.

1828
01:13:34,164 --> 01:13:36,228
Yeah, that's you
in the seventh chair.

1829
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:37,394
Look at your stack of chips.

1830
01:13:37,396 --> 01:13:38,828
I've got a cab downstairs...

1831
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:42,262
Look at the time stamp.
1:06 a. m.

1832
01:13:42,264 --> 01:13:43,861
Let's fast forward to 1:07.

1833
01:13:43,863 --> 01:13:46,328
1:07,
you lose a hand to Boosty.

1834
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:48,560
- What is this?
- 1:08.

1835
01:13:48,562 --> 01:13:50,195
Our sheets say that
you didn't buy-in again

1836
01:13:50,197 --> 01:13:51,694
between 1:06 and 1:08.

1837
01:13:51,696 --> 01:13:53,827
But look at that,
your stack's bigger.

1838
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:56,261
- I can explain, it's just, uh...
- Okay, let's rewind.

1839
01:13:56,263 --> 01:13:58,161
This screen's got
the dealer changeover

1840
01:13:58,163 --> 01:14:00,528
while at the same time,
on this screen

1841
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:04,360
and... there we are.

1842
01:14:04,362 --> 01:14:08,360
This is why I can't reconcile
$57,000 from Tuesday's game.

1843
01:14:08,362 --> 01:14:10,928
A 7-11's got security cameras
on their slushy machine.

1844
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:12,628
I've got a million
dollars changing hands

1845
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:14,594
every two minutes, imbecile.

1846
01:14:14,596 --> 01:14:16,730
You don't think
I've got eyes on the table?

1847
01:14:19,196 --> 01:14:20,697
Relax.

1848
01:14:23,829 --> 01:14:25,727
I, uh, I owe people money.

1849
01:14:25,729 --> 01:14:28,060
I know. Why isn't it coming
from the trust fund?

1850
01:14:28,062 --> 01:14:31,195
I need my parents' permission
to get that much.

1851
01:14:31,197 --> 01:14:33,460
And they'd kill me. You don't
even understand what it's like.

1852
01:14:33,462 --> 01:14:35,528
People don't realize
trust fund kids.

1853
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:36,661
Are suffering
in this economy, too.

1854
01:14:36,663 --> 01:14:38,326
I realize what I did was wrong.

1855
01:14:38,328 --> 01:14:40,593
Did it take a lot of soul
searching to get you there?

1856
01:14:40,595 --> 01:14:41,995
Okay, okay, first of all

1857
01:14:41,997 --> 01:14:43,460
the guys that are making
the counterfeit chips

1858
01:14:43,462 --> 01:14:44,761
are taking you for a ride.

1859
01:14:44,763 --> 01:14:46,162
They know that
there are signatures

1860
01:14:46,164 --> 01:14:47,194
built into the chips.

1861
01:14:47,196 --> 01:14:49,961
Exact weight, infrared markings.

1862
01:14:49,963 --> 01:14:51,661
Breathe. Second.

1863
01:14:51,663 --> 01:14:53,528
Don't try this
at anyone else's game

1864
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:55,060
because if you do,
they are going to express

1865
01:14:55,062 --> 01:14:57,727
their anger in a much different
way than I am.

1866
01:14:57,729 --> 01:14:59,461
You owe me $57,000.

1867
01:14:59,463 --> 01:15:01,027
When I get it, you get the tape

1868
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:02,195
but until then

1869
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:04,326
you don't play in anyone's game.

1870
01:15:04,328 --> 01:15:07,360
So when Tuesday night
came, B was at it again.

1871
01:15:07,362 --> 01:15:09,228
Your exposure's crazy.

1872
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:11,360
It's not if, it's when.

1873
01:15:11,362 --> 01:15:13,228
You're gonna get blown up.

1874
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:15,727
Your risk is nuts.

1875
01:15:15,729 --> 01:15:18,162
If I took a rake, this game
would no longer be legal.

1876
01:15:18,164 --> 01:15:22,127
And if you can't cover,
this game will no longer exist.

1877
01:15:22,129 --> 01:15:23,895
You're the bank now.

1878
01:15:23,897 --> 01:15:26,564
You're guaranteeing the game.

1879
01:15:29,163 --> 01:15:30,493
If you see a hand

1880
01:15:30,495 --> 01:15:31,960
you don't want to carry

1881
01:15:31,962 --> 01:15:33,561
just look at me

1882
01:15:33,563 --> 01:15:35,327
flash me a number

1883
01:15:35,329 --> 01:15:37,564
and I'll take it off the table.

1884
01:15:38,763 --> 01:15:42,461
Most runners cap it
at five percent.

1885
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:45,396
- I'll see you out there.
- See you out there.

1886
01:16:03,563 --> 01:16:05,195
Two weeks later, around 2 a. m.

1887
01:16:05,197 --> 01:16:08,660
there was a pot that was up to
$1.3 million, pre-flop

1888
01:16:08,662 --> 01:16:11,894
with five players still in.

1889
01:16:11,896 --> 01:16:15,627
My hope was that the flop
would chase four of them off.

1890
01:16:15,629 --> 01:16:17,128
$200,000.

1891
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:18,930
Raise a $100,000.

1892
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:24,961
- $300,000 to you, sir.
- Call.

1893
01:16:24,963 --> 01:16:28,131
There was now 2.1
million on the table.

1894
01:16:31,063 --> 01:16:32,864
$300,000 to you, sir.

1895
01:16:34,496 --> 01:16:35,727
Plus 200.

1896
01:16:35,729 --> 01:16:37,396
$2.6 million.

1897
01:16:44,462 --> 01:16:46,493
Three million.

1898
01:16:46,495 --> 01:16:47,760
She was right.

1899
01:16:47,762 --> 01:16:49,794
I was extending credit.
Big numbers.

1900
01:16:49,796 --> 01:16:51,760
And it's not like
Harlan Eustice hadn't already

1901
01:16:51,762 --> 01:16:53,895
put the fear of God into me.

1902
01:16:53,897 --> 01:16:55,760
If I couldn't pay one time

1903
01:16:55,762 --> 01:16:58,261
that'd be the end of the game.

1904
01:16:58,263 --> 01:16:59,897
I was the house.

1905
01:17:03,196 --> 01:17:05,693
That's how quickly
I made the decision.

1906
01:17:05,695 --> 01:17:08,594
And just as quickly, B
calculated 2 percent of the pot

1907
01:17:08,596 --> 01:17:10,430
and took it off the table.

1908
01:17:12,862 --> 01:17:14,995
That was it,
I had just taken a rake

1909
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:19,529
in violation of
U.S. Criminal Code, 1955.

1910
01:17:24,429 --> 01:17:26,394
It's time to introduce
Douglas Downey

1911
01:17:26,396 --> 01:17:29,194
'cause Downey's gonna
take us all the way home.

1912
01:17:29,196 --> 01:17:31,028
Downey was a drunk,
and he'd stay after the game

1913
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:33,660
and hang out
while I did the books.

1914
01:17:33,662 --> 01:17:35,426
He was hard to understand
when he was drunk

1915
01:17:35,428 --> 01:17:36,628
and his conversation openers

1916
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:37,694
would always sound like

1917
01:17:37,696 --> 01:17:39,161
the title of a detective novel.

1918
01:17:39,163 --> 01:17:41,960
Victim of circumstance.

1919
01:17:41,962 --> 01:17:43,098
Yeah.

1920
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:48,493
Story of, you know...

1921
01:17:48,495 --> 01:17:51,796
Story of my proverbial,
you know...

1922
01:17:56,429 --> 01:17:59,126
- Life?
- Life.

1923
01:17:59,128 --> 01:18:01,528
He'd talk about his marriage.

1924
01:18:01,530 --> 01:18:04,393
I married young, Mol.

1925
01:18:04,395 --> 01:18:06,927
I married young
and I married dull.

1926
01:18:06,929 --> 01:18:11,095
If I'd been born in Greenwich
instead of Flushing...

1927
01:18:11,097 --> 01:18:13,027
He talked about
wanting a better life.

1928
01:18:13,029 --> 01:18:14,493
New Canaan...

1929
01:18:14,495 --> 01:18:17,494
Gone to... Rye Country Day

1930
01:18:17,496 --> 01:18:19,130
Princeton...

1931
01:18:20,997 --> 01:18:22,064
The life I'd have.

1932
01:18:23,295 --> 01:18:25,060
The wife I'd have?

1933
01:18:25,062 --> 01:18:26,996
I'd be a player.

1934
01:18:30,128 --> 01:18:31,996
Victim of circumstance.

1935
01:18:35,496 --> 01:18:38,961
Mol, these are things
I only say to you.

1936
01:18:38,963 --> 01:18:40,160
Good call.

1937
01:18:40,162 --> 01:18:41,394
And he'd talk about another

1938
01:18:41,396 --> 01:18:43,260
game he played in.

1939
01:18:43,262 --> 01:18:44,660
It was the Brooklyn game.

1940
01:18:44,662 --> 01:18:45,727
The Brighton Beach game

1941
01:18:45,729 --> 01:18:46,961
where they played all night

1942
01:18:46,963 --> 01:18:48,160
and all day.

1943
01:18:48,162 --> 01:18:50,627
The game that was
populated by Russians.

1944
01:18:50,629 --> 01:18:53,828
I'm the only Irish guy
they'll let play.

1945
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:57,361
Mol, these are the nicest
guys I've ever met.

1946
01:18:57,363 --> 01:19:00,661
Then one night, Douglas
Downey lost $80,000 at my game

1947
01:19:00,663 --> 01:19:01,960
and didn't have it.

1948
01:19:01,962 --> 01:19:04,028
Winston, can I have
the room, please?

1949
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:05,294
Sure.

1950
01:19:05,296 --> 01:19:06,797
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Mm.

1951
01:19:11,229 --> 01:19:13,059
You won a $190,000 last week.

1952
01:19:13,061 --> 01:19:16,961
- I owe Teddy Chin and Tutti...
- Right.

1953
01:19:16,963 --> 01:19:18,461
And some sports bets.

1954
01:19:18,463 --> 01:19:21,093
I'm a winner trapped
inside the body of a...

1955
01:19:21,095 --> 01:19:23,326
- Stop.
- Yeah.

1956
01:19:23,328 --> 01:19:25,593
The Brooklyn game.

1957
01:19:25,595 --> 01:19:27,361
Is everything I've heard true?

1958
01:19:27,363 --> 01:19:28,861
What have you heard?

1959
01:19:28,863 --> 01:19:30,426
The Russian's have deep pockets

1960
01:19:30,428 --> 01:19:31,827
bad at poker, give action

1961
01:19:31,829 --> 01:19:33,828
pay instantly
and wear a coat and tie.

1962
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:35,097
It's all true.

1963
01:19:39,295 --> 01:19:41,059
Bring me some of those players
and I'll give you

1964
01:19:41,061 --> 01:19:44,094
a piece of the game
until your 80K is paid down.

1965
01:19:44,096 --> 01:19:45,928
Loser is what I was gonna say.

1966
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:48,060
Winner trapped inside
the body of a...

1967
01:19:48,062 --> 01:19:49,394
- I know. Got it.
- Loser.

1968
01:19:49,396 --> 01:19:50,728
Can you bring me some players?

1969
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:53,060
I'm the only Irish guy
they'll let play.

1970
01:19:53,062 --> 01:19:55,059
Do you understand the deal
I'm offering you?

1971
01:19:55,061 --> 01:19:57,927
No, I'm saying this
because you're Irish

1972
01:19:57,929 --> 01:19:59,928
and they may not want
to play in your game.

1973
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:02,226
I'm the only Irish guy
they'll let play.

1974
01:20:02,228 --> 01:20:04,162
I'm not Irish.

1975
01:20:06,263 --> 01:20:09,895
- You're not?
- No.

1976
01:20:09,897 --> 01:20:11,126
Molly Bloom?

1977
01:20:11,128 --> 01:20:13,463
You're thinking
of the James Joyce character.

1978
01:20:15,263 --> 01:20:17,427
I always thought you were Irish.

1979
01:20:17,429 --> 01:20:19,226
I'm not.
Can you bring me some players?

1980
01:20:19,228 --> 01:20:20,627
Isn't there a famous book...

1981
01:20:20,629 --> 01:20:22,260
Okay, Douglas, focus up.

1982
01:20:22,262 --> 01:20:24,627
Yes, there's a book
by James Joyce called "Ulysses"

1983
01:20:24,629 --> 01:20:25,928
and there's a character
named Molly Bloom

1984
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:27,393
and that is why
you think I'm Irish

1985
01:20:27,395 --> 01:20:29,394
but now it's time
to move past that.

1986
01:20:29,396 --> 01:20:31,731
Can you bring me
some Brighton Beach players?

1987
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,694
If you're not Irish,
what are you?

1988
01:20:36,696 --> 01:20:38,827
I'm a Russian Jew.

1989
01:20:38,829 --> 01:20:41,660
The next week, I
had some new players.

1990
01:20:41,662 --> 01:20:43,027
Mike was the first one
to arrive.

1991
01:20:43,029 --> 01:20:44,959
- I'm Jesse.
- I'm Mike Davidoff.

1992
01:20:44,961 --> 01:20:46,694
Mike owned a
chain of medical clinics

1993
01:20:46,696 --> 01:20:49,026
and had already posted
with a wire transfer.

1994
01:20:49,028 --> 01:20:52,027
Next were the Gershen brothers.
Illya and Alexei.

1995
01:20:52,029 --> 01:20:54,660
They were in the business
of exporting steel to China.

1996
01:20:54,662 --> 01:20:56,728
Alexei brought a quarter
of a million dollars

1997
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:58,864
in cash, in a backpack.

1998
01:20:59,962 --> 01:21:03,060
Mr. Habib, good evening.
I'm Shelby.

1999
01:21:03,062 --> 01:21:05,894
I'm Shelly.
Only one letter's different.

2000
01:21:05,896 --> 01:21:08,261
Also I'm a billionaire. I think
I may have seen you naked.

2001
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:10,728
No. You would remember.

2002
01:21:10,730 --> 01:21:12,261
And then Shelly Habib.

2003
01:21:12,263 --> 01:21:14,161
The Habib family
owns the largest collection

2004
01:21:14,163 --> 01:21:17,828
of classical art in the world,
valued at 3 billion dollars

2005
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:19,560
and Shelly runs
the Hallie Gallery

2006
01:21:19,562 --> 01:21:20,727
on Madison Avenue.

2007
01:21:20,729 --> 01:21:22,293
As for tonight, I was not able

2008
01:21:22,295 --> 01:21:23,627
to put my hands on cash today

2009
01:21:23,629 --> 01:21:24,661
because I woke up this morning

2010
01:21:24,663 --> 01:21:26,093
after the banks had closed.

2011
01:21:26,095 --> 01:21:27,394
So I'm hoping you'll accept

2012
01:21:27,396 --> 01:21:29,664
this as temporary collateral.

2013
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:35,593
That is an authentic Monet?

2014
01:21:35,595 --> 01:21:38,460
Grabbed it right off the wall.

2015
01:21:38,462 --> 01:21:40,694
You came over here
carrying a Monet?

2016
01:21:40,696 --> 01:21:43,926
I was driven and I have security
outside the door.

2017
01:21:43,928 --> 01:21:46,460
Okay, Shelly.
Here's what I need you to do.

2018
01:21:46,462 --> 01:21:48,194
I need you to get this...

2019
01:21:48,196 --> 01:21:49,493
- What, four?
- Seven.

2020
01:21:49,495 --> 01:21:50,594
Seven million dollar

2021
01:21:50,596 --> 01:21:51,927
painting out of here right now.

2022
01:21:51,929 --> 01:21:54,094
- And you're, I assume, armed?
- Sure.

2023
01:21:54,096 --> 01:21:56,561
Security can't stand
in front of the door.

2024
01:21:56,563 --> 01:21:58,226
Fix this up, come on back

2025
01:21:58,228 --> 01:22:01,460
and I'll extend you credit
tonight up to one and a half.

2026
01:22:01,462 --> 01:22:03,493
You're a very
beautiful woman.

2027
01:22:03,495 --> 01:22:04,893
Please be careful
with the painting.

2028
01:22:04,895 --> 01:22:06,327
Always.

2029
01:22:06,329 --> 01:22:08,861
Mike, Illya,
Alexei and Shelly.

2030
01:22:08,863 --> 01:22:10,926
Those were the players
Doug Downey brought me.

2031
01:22:10,928 --> 01:22:13,927
As advertised,
they played loose, gave action

2032
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:16,461
lost to the regulars
and settled right away.

2033
01:22:16,463 --> 01:22:19,226
People have asked,
"Wasn't there any way to tell

2034
01:22:19,228 --> 01:22:20,993
"that some of the players
at your game were connected

2035
01:22:20,995 --> 01:22:22,827
"to one of the darkest,
deadliest

2036
01:22:22,829 --> 01:22:26,126
and far-reaching organized
crime syndicates in the world?"

2037
01:22:26,128 --> 01:22:28,427
No. There wasn't.

2038
01:22:28,429 --> 01:22:30,464
I'm gonna go all in.

2039
01:23:27,463 --> 01:23:29,927
I wish I had better news.

2040
01:23:29,929 --> 01:23:32,728
Harrison Wellstone didn't go
for the minor role reduction?

2041
01:23:32,730 --> 01:23:33,959
No.

2042
01:23:33,961 --> 01:23:35,761
He didn't buy that
I was a cocktail waitress?

2043
01:23:35,763 --> 01:23:38,860
- No.
- Aww. Is it because I wasn't?

2044
01:23:38,862 --> 01:23:41,426
Hey, I tried, which is what
you're not paying me to do.

2045
01:23:41,428 --> 01:23:42,760
So what now?

2046
01:23:42,762 --> 01:23:44,093
The Government
is expressing an interest

2047
01:23:44,095 --> 01:23:45,661
in you being
a cooperating witness.

2048
01:23:45,663 --> 01:23:46,927
- You don't say?
- Molly.

2049
01:23:46,929 --> 01:23:48,694
Who could've possibly seen that
coming?

2050
01:23:48,696 --> 01:23:50,394
- Let's have the conversation.
- It will be short.

2051
01:23:50,396 --> 01:23:51,994
Because I don't know anything
at all that can help them.

2052
01:23:51,996 --> 01:23:53,628
You don't know anything that can
help them convict

2053
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:55,294
the Russians, but you
know things that can help them.

2054
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:57,760
Did you know that
97 percent of Federal cases

2055
01:23:57,762 --> 01:23:58,993
never make it to trial?

2056
01:23:58,995 --> 01:24:00,759
Even though the chances
of being convicted

2057
01:24:00,761 --> 01:24:02,127
at trial is a little more than
one in a hundred?

2058
01:24:02,129 --> 01:24:03,926
If you want to go
to trial, that's fine.

2059
01:24:03,928 --> 01:24:06,293
But it's gonna cost you
in the area of $3,500,000

2060
01:24:06,295 --> 01:24:08,361
Which the Justice Department
knows I don't have

2061
01:24:08,363 --> 01:24:09,693
because they took
all of my money

2062
01:24:09,695 --> 01:24:11,194
in a civil forfeiture
which they can do

2063
01:24:11,196 --> 01:24:13,326
without a warrant,
because my property

2064
01:24:13,328 --> 01:24:14,959
doesn't have a presumption
of innocence.

2065
01:24:14,961 --> 01:24:17,227
Then after I'm arrested
by 17 agents

2066
01:24:17,229 --> 01:24:19,628
holding automatic weapons,
totally necessary

2067
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:21,094
not at all meant
to intimidate me.

2068
01:24:21,096 --> 01:24:23,126
I'm given two days
to hire a lawyer

2069
01:24:23,128 --> 01:24:25,127
and appear in a courtroom on
the other side of the country.

2070
01:24:25,129 --> 01:24:26,860
If you're saying
that everything that happens

2071
01:24:26,862 --> 01:24:28,793
from the moment
you are arrested is designed

2072
01:24:28,795 --> 01:24:30,794
to persuade you to plead guilty,
you are correct.

2073
01:24:30,796 --> 01:24:32,494
So tell me all the ways
I can help

2074
01:24:32,496 --> 01:24:34,161
'cause I really feel
I owe it to them.

2075
01:24:34,163 --> 01:24:35,661
Oh, speaking of owing

2076
01:24:35,663 --> 01:24:38,127
the IRS put a tax lien
on the money they took from me.

2077
01:24:38,129 --> 01:24:40,693
Are you ki... Alright.
None of that matters.

2078
01:24:40,695 --> 01:24:42,394
Taking my money wasn't a tax

2079
01:24:42,396 --> 01:24:44,294
I also need
to give them my money.

2080
01:24:44,296 --> 01:24:45,927
- Or they will take it again.
- None of that matters.

2081
01:24:45,929 --> 01:24:47,660
- It needed to be said.
- Not really.

2082
01:24:47,662 --> 01:24:49,560
So, to be clear, you're not
interested in entering

2083
01:24:49,562 --> 01:24:51,093
a cooperation agreement
with the prosecutors?

2084
01:24:51,095 --> 01:24:53,661
If I had testimony that would
lead to the conviction

2085
01:24:53,663 --> 01:24:55,427
of a bad guy, no one would have

2086
01:24:55,429 --> 01:24:57,094
to coerce me into cooperating.

2087
01:24:57,096 --> 01:25:01,261
But I don't. I have dirt.
I have dish. I have gossip.

2088
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:02,692
So my value to the prosecution

2089
01:25:02,694 --> 01:25:05,226
is exactly the same
as it is to Hollywood.

2090
01:25:05,228 --> 01:25:08,361
I'm here to ensure the
New York Post covers the trial.

2091
01:25:08,363 --> 01:25:09,660
I'm here to sell tickets.

2092
01:25:09,662 --> 01:25:11,893
Which is nonetheless
value to the prosecution.

2093
01:25:11,895 --> 01:25:14,327
So what we do
is leverage it to get

2094
01:25:14,329 --> 01:25:15,794
you a favorable sentencing
recommendation

2095
01:25:15,796 --> 01:25:19,193
or, better yet,
complete immunity. What?

2096
01:25:19,195 --> 01:25:20,794
Oh. Hey, honey.

2097
01:25:20,796 --> 01:25:22,763
- Hey, Stella.
- Hey.

2098
01:25:23,329 --> 01:25:24,361
Hey.

2099
01:25:24,363 --> 01:25:25,759
What does he have you doing now?

2100
01:25:25,761 --> 01:25:27,093
An essay on three poems

2101
01:25:27,095 --> 01:25:28,759
with what he believes
are a common theme.

2102
01:25:28,761 --> 01:25:31,093
Not an essay. Two paragraphs.

2103
01:25:31,095 --> 01:25:33,594
- Which three poems?
- Close, Rush and Walls.

2104
01:25:33,596 --> 01:25:36,560
Oh, I know those.
What's the common theme?

2105
01:25:36,562 --> 01:25:38,094
Things with one word titles.

2106
01:25:38,096 --> 01:25:40,127
Are you sure you're qualified
to be teaching poetry?

2107
01:25:40,129 --> 01:25:42,059
Hang on... And yes.

2108
01:25:42,061 --> 01:25:44,926
Anytime you wanna run away from
home, you can come live with me.

2109
01:25:44,928 --> 01:25:46,826
Then you'll discover
she doesn't have a home

2110
01:25:46,828 --> 01:25:49,160
and you'll come back to me.

2111
01:25:49,162 --> 01:25:50,693
This is good. Great.

2112
01:25:50,695 --> 01:25:52,460
Why don't you grab a snack
and start your homework

2113
01:25:52,462 --> 01:25:53,494
in one of the conference rooms?

2114
01:25:53,496 --> 01:25:55,059
Okay. See ya.

2115
01:25:55,061 --> 01:25:56,893
There's no law that says you
can't just hit him in the head.

2116
01:25:56,895 --> 01:25:58,528
There is a law that says that,
it's the first thing

2117
01:25:58,530 --> 01:25:59,926
I taught her to read.

2118
01:25:59,928 --> 01:26:00,996
Go.

2119
01:26:06,896 --> 01:26:09,692
My father used
to give us extra work.

2120
01:26:09,694 --> 01:26:11,726
Can I ask you a question?

2121
01:26:11,728 --> 01:26:14,193
You think I'm too hard on her?

2122
01:26:14,195 --> 01:26:17,293
I met a girl when I first moved
to L.A., she was 22.

2123
01:26:17,295 --> 01:26:19,460
Someone arranged through
a third party

2124
01:26:19,462 --> 01:26:20,760
to spend the weekend
with her in London.

2125
01:26:20,762 --> 01:26:22,094
You know what she got?

2126
01:26:22,096 --> 01:26:24,326
For a weekend? Five grand.

2127
01:26:24,328 --> 01:26:27,727
A bag. A Chanel bag she wanted.

2128
01:26:27,729 --> 01:26:31,464
Whatever you're doing
with Stella, double it.

2129
01:26:38,762 --> 01:26:40,896
Where's your father in all this?

2130
01:26:43,263 --> 01:26:45,059
You mean, physically?

2131
01:26:45,061 --> 01:26:47,695
He's in Colorado.

2132
01:26:50,096 --> 01:26:51,993
Your parents still together?

2133
01:26:51,995 --> 01:26:53,528
No.

2134
01:26:53,530 --> 01:26:55,994
You and your father close?

2135
01:26:55,996 --> 01:26:57,226
No.

2136
01:26:57,228 --> 01:26:59,793
Was he tough on you?

2137
01:26:59,795 --> 01:27:01,426
You know how many girls
at the Olympics

2138
01:27:01,428 --> 01:27:03,027
have demanding fathers?

2139
01:27:03,029 --> 01:27:05,930
- All of them?
- Well, that's right.

2140
01:27:08,694 --> 01:27:11,260
I was tough on him.

2141
01:27:11,262 --> 01:27:12,826
What do you mean?

2142
01:27:12,828 --> 01:27:15,394
Um...

2143
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:17,763
I was a brat.

2144
01:27:20,561 --> 01:27:22,464
Fathers don't care.

2145
01:27:24,195 --> 01:27:27,693
- I'd start fights with him.
- Why?

2146
01:27:27,695 --> 01:27:30,094
You're lying!

2147
01:27:30,096 --> 01:27:31,927
Why would I
start fights with him?

2148
01:27:31,929 --> 01:27:33,493
Yeah.

2149
01:27:33,495 --> 01:27:35,095
I put you through grad school!

2150
01:27:36,962 --> 01:27:38,528
I raised the kids.

2151
01:27:38,530 --> 01:27:42,660
I did every... God, everything!

2152
01:27:42,662 --> 01:27:43,727
No.

2153
01:27:43,729 --> 01:27:45,461
No, you listen to me.

2154
01:27:45,463 --> 01:27:47,660
All you do is cheat on me,
and lie to me

2155
01:27:47,662 --> 01:27:49,497
and lie to the kids!

2156
01:27:50,829 --> 01:27:53,397
You lie to your wife
and you lie to your kids.

2157
01:27:56,029 --> 01:27:57,962
I don't know.

2158
01:28:00,761 --> 01:28:03,293
For the record, the law in 1955

2159
01:28:03,295 --> 01:28:06,059
that I'm accused of breaking it,
defines gambling as betting

2160
01:28:06,061 --> 01:28:07,726
on games of chance.

2161
01:28:07,728 --> 01:28:09,426
- Yes.
- Poker isn't a game of chance.

2162
01:28:09,428 --> 01:28:11,592
Roulette's a game of chance.

2163
01:28:11,594 --> 01:28:15,427
- Poker's a game of skill.
- Still, I me...

2164
01:28:15,429 --> 01:28:17,763
I'll tell them everything
they want to know about me.

2165
01:28:19,996 --> 01:28:21,929
About me.

2166
01:28:22,995 --> 01:28:24,929
That's it.

2167
01:28:28,729 --> 01:28:30,793
Remember Bad Brad Marion?

2168
01:28:30,795 --> 01:28:33,526
It turns out his $700,000,000
hedge fund

2169
01:28:33,528 --> 01:28:36,094
wasn't what you would
call... real.

2170
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:37,727
It was a Ponzi scheme.

2171
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:39,859
He'd been falsely reporting
profits for years.

2172
01:28:39,861 --> 01:28:42,059
He wasn't even registered
with the SEC.

2173
01:28:42,061 --> 01:28:44,094
With the money given to him
by friends and family

2174
01:28:44,096 --> 01:28:46,059
and players at the game,
he bought several

2175
01:28:46,061 --> 01:28:47,427
Malibu Beach Houses

2176
01:28:47,429 --> 01:28:49,161
an airplane hanger
full of cars

2177
01:28:49,163 --> 01:28:52,127
another one with an airplane,
and a life he wanted.

2178
01:28:52,129 --> 01:28:55,193
When he was arrested,
he had $740 in the bank.

2179
01:28:55,195 --> 01:28:57,726
Brad cooperated with the FBI
and gave them hours

2180
01:28:57,728 --> 01:28:59,959
of testimony
on a range of subjects.

2181
01:28:59,961 --> 01:29:01,592
Including how three years
earlier

2182
01:29:01,594 --> 01:29:03,759
he lost $5,200,000

2183
01:29:03,761 --> 01:29:05,760
in an underground
celebrity poker game

2184
01:29:05,762 --> 01:29:08,227
that was run by a girl
named Molly Bloom.

2185
01:29:08,229 --> 01:29:09,560
His story was that
I had induced him

2186
01:29:09,562 --> 01:29:11,261
to play in a high stakes game.

2187
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:12,860
I just wanted to introduce you
to Brad Marion.

2188
01:29:12,862 --> 01:29:14,293
And that due to my enabling

2189
01:29:14,295 --> 01:29:15,626
he'd become a gambling addict.

2190
01:29:15,628 --> 01:29:17,692
...who made me
become a gambling addict.

2191
01:29:17,694 --> 01:29:19,093
Brad, this game might
not be for you.

2192
01:29:19,095 --> 01:29:20,660
Federal Bankruptcy lawyers

2193
01:29:20,662 --> 01:29:22,026
were brought in to recover
as much

2194
01:29:22,028 --> 01:29:24,060
of the boosted money
as they could.

2195
01:29:24,062 --> 01:29:27,194
I was sent a subpoena and flew
out to L.A. to be deposed.

2196
01:29:27,196 --> 01:29:29,460
Can you confirm
the names on the list

2197
01:29:29,462 --> 01:29:31,526
all played poker
with Brad Marion?

2198
01:29:31,528 --> 01:29:33,527
This list was provided
to you by Brad Marion?

2199
01:29:33,529 --> 01:29:35,027
I just need you
to confirm for the record

2200
01:29:35,029 --> 01:29:37,093
that your game included
but was not limited to...

2201
01:29:37,095 --> 01:29:39,692
I understand, what I'm trying
to get on the record is that

2202
01:29:39,694 --> 01:29:42,626
I'm not the one
who provided the list.

2203
01:29:42,628 --> 01:29:45,162
These names were provided
by Brad Marion.

2204
01:29:46,561 --> 01:29:48,994
So, under oath...

2205
01:29:48,996 --> 01:29:52,327
Yes. I can confirm
the list is accurate.

2206
01:29:52,329 --> 01:29:54,793
The L.A. players
and I were given a choice.

2207
01:29:54,795 --> 01:29:57,260
Testify against each other
in open court

2208
01:29:57,262 --> 01:30:00,993
or help make restitution to the
victims of Brad's Ponzi scheme.

2209
01:30:00,995 --> 01:30:04,194
I wrote the government
a check for $500,000 dollars.

2210
01:30:04,196 --> 01:30:07,261
And somewhere in an FBI field
office in New York

2211
01:30:07,263 --> 01:30:10,097
someone was pinning
my picture to a wall.

2212
01:30:11,562 --> 01:30:13,160
I was running six games a week

2213
01:30:13,162 --> 01:30:15,794
sometimes at two different
locations in a night.

2214
01:30:15,796 --> 01:30:19,227
And by this point,
I was addicted to drugs.

2215
01:30:19,229 --> 01:30:21,493
Adderall. Ambien. Xanax. Coke.

2216
01:30:21,495 --> 01:30:24,526
Alcohol, Valium,
Ativan, Trazadone.

2217
01:30:24,528 --> 01:30:27,693
Anything that could keep me up
for a few days

2218
01:30:27,695 --> 01:30:30,163
and knock me out
for a few hours.

2219
01:30:32,862 --> 01:30:36,027
But I wasn't just taking them
to stay awake anymore.

2220
01:30:36,029 --> 01:30:40,194
It was dark and friendless
where I was.

2221
01:30:40,196 --> 01:30:43,426
I felt like I was in a hole
so deep, I could go fracking.

2222
01:30:43,428 --> 01:30:47,126
It didn't feel like depression,
it felt more violent.

2223
01:30:48,594 --> 01:30:50,260
I was tired of living
in the frat house

2224
01:30:50,262 --> 01:30:51,860
I'd built for degenerates.

2225
01:30:51,862 --> 01:30:54,226
I was tired of the greed.

2226
01:30:54,228 --> 01:30:57,160
Mine, not theirs. Everybody's.

2227
01:30:57,162 --> 01:30:59,094
I was sick
of being high all the time.

2228
01:30:59,096 --> 01:31:01,359
I was sick
of living in the grey area.

2229
01:31:01,361 --> 01:31:02,960
I couldn't recognize myself

2230
01:31:02,962 --> 01:31:05,463
and what I recognized,
I couldn't stand.

2231
01:31:06,995 --> 01:31:09,726
After a game one night,
Douglas Downey surprised me

2232
01:31:09,728 --> 01:31:11,492
with a confession,
after opening

2233
01:31:11,494 --> 01:31:13,294
with another
detective story title.

2234
01:31:13,296 --> 01:31:15,560
Gut shot on the river.

2235
01:31:15,562 --> 01:31:17,927
- I want to say something.
- Okay.

2236
01:31:17,929 --> 01:31:21,893
- I want to say, um, something.
- Okay.

2237
01:31:21,895 --> 01:31:24,093
- I'm just gonna say...
- Cool.

2238
01:31:24,095 --> 01:31:28,659
Because there's a poem,
a famous, uh...

2239
01:31:28,661 --> 01:31:31,493
A poem about...

2240
01:31:31,495 --> 01:31:33,894
thoughts left unexpressed.

2241
01:31:33,896 --> 01:31:37,629
Two roads emerged
from the woods.

2242
01:31:38,928 --> 01:31:40,862
Do they explode?

2243
01:31:41,996 --> 01:31:45,160
I don't know.
Do you like poetry?

2244
01:31:45,162 --> 01:31:46,793
I did until a second ago.
I'm gonna call you...

2245
01:31:46,795 --> 01:31:48,930
I'm, I'm in love with you.

2246
01:31:51,129 --> 01:31:54,126
- This isn't happening.
- Plain and simple.

2247
01:31:54,128 --> 01:31:56,593
You're the woman
I've always dreamed of

2248
01:31:56,595 --> 01:31:57,860
and I've been dreaming...

2249
01:31:57,862 --> 01:32:00,060
Shh. Stop it.
Listen to me, Douglas.

2250
01:32:00,062 --> 01:32:02,459
I'm the woman all of you
have always dreamed of.

2251
01:32:02,461 --> 01:32:05,425
I'm the anti-wife.
I encourage your gambling.

2252
01:32:05,427 --> 01:32:06,960
I have drinks served
to you by models

2253
01:32:06,962 --> 01:32:09,425
who simultaneously
create the impression

2254
01:32:09,427 --> 01:32:11,094
that you're the kind of guy
who can score

2255
01:32:11,096 --> 01:32:12,592
a dime piece anytime you want.

2256
01:32:12,594 --> 01:32:15,161
It's nice for you in here.

2257
01:32:15,163 --> 01:32:17,292
Do you know who Circe was?

2258
01:32:17,294 --> 01:32:20,959
- Uh...
- Circe?

2259
01:32:20,961 --> 01:32:22,760
Used to play
in Teddy Chin's game?

2260
01:32:22,762 --> 01:32:25,994
Nope. Circe did not play
in Teddy's game.

2261
01:32:25,996 --> 01:32:27,894
She was the Greek goddess
of magic.

2262
01:32:27,896 --> 01:32:30,894
And she gave men feasts
with wine and honey

2263
01:32:30,896 --> 01:32:32,826
and then turned them into swine.

2264
01:32:32,828 --> 01:32:36,592
- Why?
- Fantastic question.

2265
01:32:36,594 --> 01:32:39,459
I would never do that to you.

2266
01:32:39,461 --> 01:32:41,759
Missed the point by miles,
but that's okay.

2267
01:32:41,761 --> 01:32:43,893
Oh.

2268
01:32:43,895 --> 01:32:45,559
Um, Molly.

2269
01:32:45,561 --> 01:32:49,093
Shelby and Winston
will close up.

2270
01:32:49,095 --> 01:32:50,730
I'll see you next week.

2271
01:32:56,428 --> 01:32:58,393
Here you go,
thanks a lot, Randy.

2272
01:32:58,395 --> 01:32:59,826
Thanks, Molly.

2273
01:32:59,828 --> 01:33:02,659
- Good morning.
- Morning, Pat.

2274
01:33:02,661 --> 01:33:06,292
Pat was my driver and security.

2275
01:33:06,294 --> 01:33:08,126
- Straight home?
- Yeah.

2276
01:33:08,128 --> 01:33:09,727
We didn't know
much more about each other

2277
01:33:09,729 --> 01:33:12,027
than we needed to know,
but I liked him.

2278
01:33:12,029 --> 01:33:13,962
We were friends.

2279
01:33:19,661 --> 01:33:23,627
I used to be
a competitive athlete.

2280
01:33:23,629 --> 01:33:25,093
I didn't know if you knew that.

2281
01:33:25,095 --> 01:33:27,226
What sport?

2282
01:33:27,228 --> 01:33:29,292
Skiing.

2283
01:33:29,294 --> 01:33:31,526
Freestyle.

2284
01:33:31,528 --> 01:33:33,662
Were you good?

2285
01:33:35,595 --> 01:33:37,729
I don't know.

2286
01:33:44,595 --> 01:33:46,493
- Hey, Molly.
- Pat asked me a favor.

2287
01:33:46,495 --> 01:33:48,559
He said there were a
couple of hedge fund guys

2288
01:33:48,561 --> 01:33:50,192
in New Jersey
who wanted to play

2289
01:33:50,194 --> 01:33:52,225
and he could score points
with them if he was able

2290
01:33:52,227 --> 01:33:53,492
to get them a meeting with me.

2291
01:33:53,494 --> 01:33:55,159
I said, "Sure," and set
the meeting

2292
01:33:55,161 --> 01:33:58,259
for 5 p. m. on a Thursday
at the Four Seasons Bar.

2293
01:33:58,261 --> 01:33:59,959
Knowing that if they were legit

2294
01:33:59,961 --> 01:34:02,094
they'd recognize someone
in the crowd at happy hour

2295
01:34:02,096 --> 01:34:04,226
at the Four Seasons right after
the closing bell.

2296
01:34:04,228 --> 01:34:06,794
It turns out I didn't
need to be that clever.

2297
01:34:06,796 --> 01:34:08,526
These weren't finance guys.

2298
01:34:08,528 --> 01:34:10,359
They were from the cast
of "Jersey Boys."

2299
01:34:10,361 --> 01:34:12,493
They looked around the bar
self-consciously.

2300
01:34:12,495 --> 01:34:13,859
They were out of their element.

2301
01:34:13,861 --> 01:34:15,393
And tough guys
try to look tougher

2302
01:34:15,395 --> 01:34:16,759
when they're insecure.

2303
01:34:16,761 --> 01:34:18,093
I had a good hunch
what they wanted

2304
01:34:18,095 --> 01:34:19,693
and I was gonna have
to shut down

2305
01:34:19,695 --> 01:34:21,560
this meeting quickly,
but without being rude

2306
01:34:21,562 --> 01:34:23,960
to Joey Bag-a-Donuts
and Secaucus Sal.

2307
01:34:23,962 --> 01:34:25,593
I'm Molly Bloom.
Nice to meet you.

2308
01:34:25,595 --> 01:34:27,260
- John G.
- And you are?

2309
01:34:27,262 --> 01:34:28,930
Paul.

2310
01:34:29,996 --> 01:34:32,626
How do we get a drink?

2311
01:34:32,628 --> 01:34:34,593
I don't remember
what the other guy ordered

2312
01:34:34,595 --> 01:34:35,994
but I'll never forget
what John G had.

2313
01:34:35,996 --> 01:34:37,626
He looked at the waiter
as if to say

2314
01:34:37,628 --> 01:34:39,059
that he could handle
himself just fine

2315
01:34:39,061 --> 01:34:41,060
among the Manhattan elite
and said...

2316
01:34:41,062 --> 01:34:42,996
I'll have an Appletini.

2317
01:34:44,594 --> 01:34:46,826
- Okay.
- So, how was your week?

2318
01:34:46,828 --> 01:34:50,160
My week? Uh, it was fine.
Thank you.

2319
01:34:50,162 --> 01:34:54,659
Pat said you guys might
be interested in a game?

2320
01:34:54,661 --> 01:34:57,426
We want to partner
with you.

2321
01:34:57,428 --> 01:34:59,926
- We've talked to Tutti, Will...
- Teddy Chin.

2322
01:34:59,928 --> 01:35:01,226
Teddy Chin.

2323
01:35:01,228 --> 01:35:03,592
We did a little work
with them too.

2324
01:35:03,594 --> 01:35:05,729
We can make
your life easier.

2325
01:35:07,594 --> 01:35:10,125
Nobody will fuck with you.

2326
01:35:10,127 --> 01:35:12,062
Nobody will stiff you.

2327
01:35:15,028 --> 01:35:19,826
I appreciate the offer,
but really, I'm fine.

2328
01:35:19,828 --> 01:35:22,626
I don't carry a big debt sheet.
I feel safe.

2329
01:35:22,628 --> 01:35:25,693
Ah-uh, you lied just then

2330
01:35:25,695 --> 01:35:28,026
when you said you don't carry
a big debt sheet.

2331
01:35:28,028 --> 01:35:30,359
You've got 2.8 million
on the street right now

2332
01:35:30,361 --> 01:35:31,994
right as we're sitting here.

2333
01:35:31,996 --> 01:35:33,627
We do our research.

2334
01:35:33,629 --> 01:35:35,626
That money should be
in your hands.

2335
01:35:35,628 --> 01:35:39,393
'Cause it's yours. It's yours.

2336
01:35:39,395 --> 01:35:40,759
And if you don't have it,
you got

2337
01:35:40,761 --> 01:35:42,896
to go into your pocket
to pay the wins.

2338
01:35:44,494 --> 01:35:46,560
Fellas, I'm sorry.

2339
01:35:46,562 --> 01:35:49,559
It's just a friendly game
with higher stakes.

2340
01:35:49,561 --> 01:35:51,459
It was really nice
to meet you though.

2341
01:35:51,461 --> 01:35:53,759
Let me know if there's ever
anything I can do for you.

2342
01:35:53,761 --> 01:35:55,793
I like to do favors.

2343
01:35:55,795 --> 01:35:58,460
They'll put your drinks
on my card.

2344
01:35:58,462 --> 01:36:00,126
There are some
gaps in my memory

2345
01:36:00,128 --> 01:36:01,793
which they say is common
when you've had

2346
01:36:01,795 --> 01:36:03,160
what's called, an event.

2347
01:36:03,162 --> 01:36:04,994
For instance, I don't remember
where I was

2348
01:36:04,996 --> 01:36:07,160
coming from when I walked
into my building.

2349
01:36:07,162 --> 01:36:09,159
Just that my doorman, Reggie,
said he had packages for me.

2350
01:36:09,161 --> 01:36:10,393
Ms. Bloom, I think
I got some things

2351
01:36:10,395 --> 01:36:11,492
for you in the package room.

2352
01:36:11,494 --> 01:36:13,058
- I'll bring them on up.
- Thanks.

2353
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:14,560
It was the first
night of two weeks off

2354
01:36:14,562 --> 01:36:16,425
for Christmas and New Year's.

2355
01:36:16,427 --> 01:36:20,660
And my plan was to take a bath
and try not to take drugs.

2356
01:36:20,662 --> 01:36:23,092
Reggie came up
with my packages.

2357
01:36:26,828 --> 01:36:29,692
Ahh, I'm sorry,
you're in the wrong...

2358
01:36:29,694 --> 01:36:31,795
Wait! Okay, hold on a second,
I have...

2359
01:36:36,528 --> 01:36:38,162
Not a sound.

2360
01:36:42,028 --> 01:36:43,325
Do you hear me?

2361
01:36:43,327 --> 01:36:45,225
I have money. It's all cash.

2362
01:36:45,227 --> 01:36:47,527
- Where?
- S-safe.

2363
01:36:47,529 --> 01:36:48,860
Where is it?

2364
01:36:48,862 --> 01:36:51,062
- It's in the closet.
- Show me.

2365
01:37:08,896 --> 01:37:11,396
Put the money
and jewelry in a bag.

2366
01:37:20,295 --> 01:37:22,429
Gold bars too.

2367
01:37:31,361 --> 01:37:32,425
Come on.

2368
01:37:32,427 --> 01:37:35,992
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.

2369
01:37:35,994 --> 01:37:39,827
It wasn't an offer they made.
It wasn't a suggestion.

2370
01:37:39,829 --> 01:37:42,826
This will be
your only reminder.

2371
01:37:42,828 --> 01:37:47,763
Your mother lives alone
in Telluride, Colorado. Right?

2372
01:37:50,194 --> 01:37:53,495
Right? Right, Molly?

2373
01:37:54,462 --> 01:37:55,893
She doesn't live there anymore.

2374
01:37:55,895 --> 01:37:57,829
Yes, she does.

2375
01:38:59,461 --> 01:39:03,226
I couldn't call a
doctor or go to an E.R.

2376
01:39:03,228 --> 01:39:05,763
They'd take one look at me
and call the police.

2377
01:39:12,829 --> 01:39:15,727
My eyes were swollen and black.

2378
01:39:15,729 --> 01:39:18,492
My lips were cut and bloody.

2379
01:39:18,494 --> 01:39:20,629
I couldn't feel my face.

2380
01:39:58,927 --> 01:40:00,926
Pat had set up the meeting

2381
01:40:00,928 --> 01:40:03,428
and he was how they knew
where I lived.

2382
01:40:06,327 --> 01:40:08,660
I stayed in my apartment
for two weeks

2383
01:40:08,662 --> 01:40:10,627
waiting for my face to heal...

2384
01:40:10,629 --> 01:40:13,463
and waiting for the phone call
I knew was coming.

2385
01:40:14,861 --> 01:40:17,226
But the call didn't come.

2386
01:40:17,228 --> 01:40:19,659
Where was the call from John G?

2387
01:40:19,661 --> 01:40:21,961
"So maybe you've had
a change of heart?"

2388
01:40:24,961 --> 01:40:28,095
After ten days, I opened my
front door for the first time.

2389
01:40:31,127 --> 01:40:33,959
People were coming back into
town after New Years in Cabo

2390
01:40:33,961 --> 01:40:36,462
and St. Bart's,
and South Beach.

2391
01:40:38,361 --> 01:40:41,893
My phone was blowing up with,
"When's the next game?"

2392
01:40:41,895 --> 01:40:44,029
But nothing from John G.

2393
01:40:45,728 --> 01:40:47,925
And then right there
on the front page

2394
01:40:47,927 --> 01:40:51,260
of the New York Times
from eight days ago...

2395
01:40:51,262 --> 01:40:55,095
nearly a 125 arrested
in sweeping mob roundup.

2396
01:40:56,395 --> 01:40:58,459
Those guys
were either laying low

2397
01:40:58,461 --> 01:41:00,592
or they were in custody.

2398
01:41:00,594 --> 01:41:03,062
Sometimes God happens fast.

2399
01:41:05,494 --> 01:41:07,692
My face had healed enough,
so that a little make-up

2400
01:41:07,694 --> 01:41:09,895
would cover the bruises
that were left.

2401
01:41:11,095 --> 01:41:13,426
I put together
a week of games.

2402
01:41:13,428 --> 01:41:16,825
One week of games to get
the 2.8 million I was owed

2403
01:41:16,827 --> 01:41:19,726
and then I was out, I was done.

2404
01:41:19,728 --> 01:41:22,592
One week of epic games.

2405
01:41:22,594 --> 01:41:24,492
I had some of my
London players in town

2406
01:41:24,494 --> 01:41:27,025
and the Russians had
visiting friends from Moscow.

2407
01:41:27,027 --> 01:41:29,892
Jesse and Shelby had already
started the game at the Plaza

2408
01:41:29,894 --> 01:41:32,626
and were reporting
heavy early action.

2409
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:35,260
I was on my way
when the phone rang.

2410
01:41:35,262 --> 01:41:37,396
It was Douglas Downey.

2411
01:41:38,595 --> 01:41:40,159
I'm on my way, Doug.

2412
01:41:40,161 --> 01:41:42,958
Wait, Molly. Wait.

2413
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:44,659
I'm hiding in the bathroom.

2414
01:41:44,661 --> 01:41:46,425
I just... I-I need you
to believe me, okay?

2415
01:41:46,427 --> 01:41:47,859
- I just...
- Whose bathroom?

2416
01:41:47,861 --> 01:41:49,359
I need you to believe me
because, uh...

2417
01:41:49,361 --> 01:41:51,626
Uh, at the suite, at the plaza.

2418
01:41:51,628 --> 01:41:53,025
Why are you hiding
in the bathroom?

2419
01:41:53,027 --> 01:41:55,691
I would never tell them
anything about you.

2420
01:41:55,693 --> 01:41:57,958
I said, "Guys,
you want me to go further

2421
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:01,159
"you want me to go other
places, I'll do it.

2422
01:42:01,161 --> 01:42:04,660
"But nothing about Molly,
she can't be touched.

2423
01:42:04,662 --> 01:42:06,993
- Just the Russians."
- Okay, you're drunk.

2424
01:42:06,995 --> 01:42:09,192
And a little difficult
to understand

2425
01:42:09,194 --> 01:42:11,126
so I'll see you in a few minutes
when I get there.

2426
01:42:11,128 --> 01:42:13,160
I was, uh...

2427
01:42:13,162 --> 01:42:15,795
I was... uh...

2428
01:42:17,728 --> 01:42:20,393
I was cited
for securities fraud.

2429
01:42:20,395 --> 01:42:22,058
It was scrubbed from my record.

2430
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:24,725
- That's why you don't know.
- Did you say Securities Fraud?

2431
01:42:24,727 --> 01:42:26,758
I would never help them
build a case against you

2432
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:30,193
I would have never give them
anything against you

2433
01:42:30,195 --> 01:42:32,725
I'd commit perjury
before I did that.

2434
01:42:32,727 --> 01:42:35,492
It was such bullshit,
it was 2006.

2435
01:42:35,494 --> 01:42:37,059
If you'd had an arrest,
I would've known.

2436
01:42:37,061 --> 01:42:39,326
- It was bullshit!
- Doug.

2437
01:42:39,328 --> 01:42:41,092
I told them I'll go further

2438
01:42:41,094 --> 01:42:44,559
I'll go other places,
but not you.

2439
01:42:44,561 --> 01:42:46,426
I love you, I, I love...

2440
01:42:46,428 --> 01:42:48,892
Doug, listen, I-I need you to
pull it together for a second.

2441
01:42:48,894 --> 01:42:51,092
Did they scrub your record,
because you've been informing?

2442
01:42:51,094 --> 01:42:53,892
Should I...
Should I have told you?

2443
01:42:53,894 --> 01:42:57,093
That's a question that'll,
that'll haunt me for all my...

2444
01:42:57,095 --> 01:42:58,492
Why are you hiding
in the bathroom?

2445
01:42:58,494 --> 01:43:00,626
...for my days, Molly.

2446
01:43:00,628 --> 01:43:04,626
Always know that I was
trying to protect you.

2447
01:43:04,628 --> 01:43:08,129
Five blocks away,
the FBI had raided my game.

2448
01:43:26,727 --> 01:43:28,225
I fully expected the lobby
to be filled

2449
01:43:28,227 --> 01:43:30,226
with guys wearing windbreakers,
but it wasn't.

2450
01:43:30,228 --> 01:43:32,292
Ms. Bloom. Haven't
seen you for a while.

2451
01:43:32,294 --> 01:43:34,594
- Yeah.
- You need a cab?

2452
01:43:40,461 --> 01:43:43,659
I guess you never made it
upstairs with the packages.

2453
01:43:43,661 --> 01:43:46,496
Maybe I didn't tip you enough
before Christmas.

2454
01:43:49,528 --> 01:43:52,160
Then you got into
a cab, took the cab to JFK

2455
01:43:52,162 --> 01:43:53,826
and flew to your mother's house
in Denver.

2456
01:43:53,828 --> 01:43:55,126
Telluride.

2457
01:43:55,128 --> 01:43:56,958
My mother lives in Telluride.

2458
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:58,992
- That was two years ago.
- Mm-hmm.

2459
01:43:58,994 --> 01:44:00,592
In a cab on the way
to the airport

2460
01:44:00,594 --> 01:44:02,658
I checked
my bank account balance.

2461
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:04,359
There should've had a little
over four million dollars

2462
01:44:04,361 --> 01:44:07,626
but instead, it said the balance
was zero, and there was a note

2463
01:44:07,628 --> 01:44:09,726
telling me to contact
the Justice Department.

2464
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:12,359
I just want to mention that she
also voluntarily checked herself

2465
01:44:12,361 --> 01:44:15,892
into 28-day rehab and has been
sober and clean for two years.

2466
01:44:15,894 --> 01:44:18,926
I don't care. Were the women
that worked for you call girls?

2467
01:44:18,928 --> 01:44:20,092
No, sir.

2468
01:44:20,094 --> 01:44:21,460
They never exchanged
sex for money?

2469
01:44:21,462 --> 01:44:22,758
No.

2470
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:24,058
Have you ever exchanged
sex for money?

2471
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:26,126
- No.
- I think he was talking to me.

2472
01:44:26,128 --> 01:44:28,192
I meant, no, she's not
answering that question.

2473
01:44:28,194 --> 01:44:29,992
- The purpose of this meeting...
- I know.

2474
01:44:29,994 --> 01:44:31,393
- Purpose of this meeting...
- We're off the record.

2475
01:44:31,395 --> 01:44:32,492
We're not off the record.

2476
01:44:32,494 --> 01:44:34,193
Do you see
a stenographer in here?

2477
01:44:34,195 --> 01:44:35,992
We're off the record in
as much as there is no record

2478
01:44:35,994 --> 01:44:37,859
but you're free to use
the information you're given

2479
01:44:37,861 --> 01:44:39,992
and we're not giving
the information for free.

2480
01:44:39,994 --> 01:44:41,926
I've been sitting at this table
for five hours

2481
01:44:41,928 --> 01:44:44,759
waiting for the opportunity
to implore you to do

2482
01:44:44,761 --> 01:44:48,092
the right thing while begging my
client for the last three weeks

2483
01:44:48,094 --> 01:44:49,858
to act in her own
best interest.

2484
01:44:49,860 --> 01:44:52,126
Neither of those things
should be hard.

2485
01:44:52,128 --> 01:44:54,659
The purpose of this meeting
is for you to meet Molly Bloom

2486
01:44:54,661 --> 01:44:56,826
and discover, as I have,
that she's not the person

2487
01:44:56,828 --> 01:44:58,058
the press has invented.

2488
01:44:58,060 --> 01:44:59,493
She's not under
Federal indictment

2489
01:44:59,494 --> 01:45:01,059
for getting bad press, Charlie

2490
01:45:01,061 --> 01:45:03,125
and the purpose of the meeting,
for me is to discover

2491
01:45:03,127 --> 01:45:05,459
if your client is willing to
cooperate with the government

2492
01:45:05,461 --> 01:45:07,892
in putting away
some bad people.

2493
01:45:07,894 --> 01:45:08,825
No.

2494
01:45:08,827 --> 01:45:10,092
You're not willing to cooperate?

2495
01:45:10,094 --> 01:45:13,993
Uh, no, I never traded
sex for money.

2496
01:45:13,995 --> 01:45:16,859
I'm still not sure if there's
a record but if there is

2497
01:45:16,861 --> 01:45:20,058
I want it to be certain
that was in it.

2498
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:22,125
It appears to me throughout
your career as a game runner

2499
01:45:22,127 --> 01:45:24,160
you were extremely diligent
about vetting players.

2500
01:45:24,162 --> 01:45:25,460
I was.

2501
01:45:25,462 --> 01:45:26,691
But you let four guys
play in the game

2502
01:45:26,693 --> 01:45:27,992
without knowing
they were connected?

2503
01:45:27,994 --> 01:45:30,829
Yeah, plus an FBI informant,
it's embarrassing.

2504
01:45:37,794 --> 01:45:41,260
I was high
at the end and...

2505
01:45:41,262 --> 01:45:43,425
doing my job badly.

2506
01:45:43,427 --> 01:45:47,160
I'll also add that in my limited
experience with the Russian mob

2507
01:45:47,162 --> 01:45:51,459
they don't immediately
present themselves as mobsters.

2508
01:45:51,461 --> 01:45:53,859
My experience with the Italian
mob on the other hand...

2509
01:45:53,861 --> 01:45:54,962
Help us.

2510
01:45:56,627 --> 01:45:58,059
I don't know anything
that can help you.

2511
01:45:58,061 --> 01:45:59,959
- Yes. Yes, you do.
- And if I did...

2512
01:45:59,961 --> 01:46:01,993
You can provide color.
You can paint a picture.

2513
01:46:01,995 --> 01:46:03,958
You can tell us Druzhinsky
wore a $100,000

2514
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:05,625
Patek Philippe
and even drove a Phantom.

2515
01:46:05,627 --> 01:46:07,293
You can tell us Illya Gershen
showed up

2516
01:46:07,295 --> 01:46:09,359
with a quarter million dollars
cash in a backpack and you can

2517
01:46:09,361 --> 01:46:11,458
tell us how much action Shelly
was taking on a sports bet.

2518
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:15,192
No one was allowed to place
sports bets inside the room.

2519
01:46:15,194 --> 01:46:16,325
They would have to go outside.

2520
01:46:16,327 --> 01:46:18,192
So I had no idea how much

2521
01:46:18,194 --> 01:46:19,859
anyone was taking or laying.

2522
01:46:19,861 --> 01:46:21,626
So now you're saying
you knew they were making

2523
01:46:21,628 --> 01:46:22,793
and taking sports bets.

2524
01:46:22,795 --> 01:46:24,492
That's the point of them
going outside.

2525
01:46:24,494 --> 01:46:26,459
They could have been calling
their mother for all I knew.

2526
01:46:26,461 --> 01:46:29,058
- Molly?
- Yes, sir.

2527
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:31,459
I don't believe you.

2528
01:46:31,461 --> 01:46:33,726
In Mike Davidoff's phone
intercepts alone

2529
01:46:33,728 --> 01:46:36,758
just Davidoff, your
name comes up 19 times.

2530
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:38,826
We need Molly... Get
Molly... Bring Molly...

2531
01:46:38,828 --> 01:46:40,692
It strongly suggests
that you were important

2532
01:46:40,694 --> 01:46:42,226
to his business, so it's hard
for me to believe

2533
01:46:42,228 --> 01:46:44,792
that someone with your savvy
and obvious intellect...

2534
01:46:44,794 --> 01:46:47,826
Talking about the drug...

2535
01:46:47,828 --> 01:46:50,558
Get Molly... Bring Molly...
We need Molly...

2536
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:53,861
It's... They're talking
about the drug ecstasy.

2537
01:46:55,928 --> 01:46:59,259
Shit. My office is next to yours
for two years

2538
01:46:59,261 --> 01:47:01,692
and I've seen you make
some bone-headed moves

2539
01:47:01,694 --> 01:47:03,691
but I've never seen
any prosecutor

2540
01:47:03,693 --> 01:47:06,492
step in it
the way you just did.

2541
01:47:06,494 --> 01:47:07,959
You should thank
all of the Gods that

2542
01:47:07,961 --> 01:47:09,293
there is no physical evidence
of that exchange.

2543
01:47:09,295 --> 01:47:11,059
- Hey, look.
- No, you look.

2544
01:47:11,061 --> 01:47:12,825
Weren't you going to implore me
to do the right thing?

2545
01:47:12,827 --> 01:47:16,160
This woman does not belong
in a RICO indictment.

2546
01:47:16,162 --> 01:47:18,058
Are you out of your minds?

2547
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:21,192
She does not belong
in a mob indictment.

2548
01:47:21,194 --> 01:47:24,725
She raked a game, that's it,
for seven months, two years ago.

2549
01:47:24,727 --> 01:47:27,293
And why? Because she was giving
credit in the millions

2550
01:47:27,295 --> 01:47:30,058
and she didn't want to use
muscle to collect.

2551
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:34,058
She has had opportunity after
opportunity to greatly benefit

2552
01:47:34,060 --> 01:47:37,459
herself by just telling
the real stories that she knows.

2553
01:47:37,461 --> 01:47:41,159
Okay? I have the forensic
imaging going back to 2007.

2554
01:47:41,161 --> 01:47:43,726
And I'm talking
about text messages, emails

2555
01:47:43,728 --> 01:47:46,559
movie stars, rock stars,
athletes, billionaires

2556
01:47:46,561 --> 01:47:48,892
all explicit,
some married with kids

2557
01:47:48,894 --> 01:47:50,792
and that's just
the tip of the iceberg.

2558
01:47:50,794 --> 01:47:52,625
What about the guy
that comes this close

2559
01:47:52,627 --> 01:47:54,525
to being the U.S. Ambassador
to Monaco?

2560
01:47:54,527 --> 01:47:57,160
He's withdrawn from
consideration at the last minute

2561
01:47:57,162 --> 01:47:59,992
no one knows why, she does.

2562
01:47:59,994 --> 01:48:02,492
CEOs with college-aged
mistresses

2563
01:48:02,494 --> 01:48:04,459
an SVP of an investment bank

2564
01:48:04,461 --> 01:48:06,859
who wanted Molly to put
a marked deck in a game.

2565
01:48:06,861 --> 01:48:08,591
The head of a movie studio
that texted her that

2566
01:48:08,593 --> 01:48:11,425
a particular movie star was too
black for his liking, I mean...

2567
01:48:11,427 --> 01:48:15,859
J. Edgar Hoover didn't
have this much shit on Bobby!

2568
01:48:15,861 --> 01:48:17,591
You know, she could
have written a best seller

2569
01:48:17,593 --> 01:48:19,192
and been set for life.

2570
01:48:19,194 --> 01:48:22,225
Easy, she's got the, she's got
the winning lottery ticket

2571
01:48:22,227 --> 01:48:24,061
and she won't cash it.

2572
01:48:26,094 --> 01:48:29,758
Your office took every dollar
she has in a constitutionally

2573
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:31,826
fucked up seizure
and then put the IRS on her

2574
01:48:31,828 --> 01:48:34,658
to tax what you seized,
I mean...

2575
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:36,126
I've been in those
strategy meetings.

2576
01:48:36,128 --> 01:48:38,324
You-you broke her back
so she couldn't possibly

2577
01:48:38,326 --> 01:48:39,958
afford to defend herself.

2578
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:42,793
And now she has an opportunity
to guarantee her freedom

2579
01:48:42,795 --> 01:48:45,858
by "providing color,"
and she still won't do it.

2580
01:48:45,860 --> 01:48:48,126
This woman does not belong
in a RICO indictment

2581
01:48:48,128 --> 01:48:50,093
she belongs
on a box of Wheaties!

2582
01:48:50,095 --> 01:48:53,193
So, yes, Harrison,
I am imploring you

2583
01:48:53,195 --> 01:48:54,826
to do the right thing.

2584
01:48:54,828 --> 01:48:56,525
She knows nothing
about the three Petes

2585
01:48:56,527 --> 01:49:00,691
nothing about Ragnyada, nothing
about RGO or insurance fraud.

2586
01:49:00,693 --> 01:49:03,459
Between the two of us, we've
appeared in front of this judge

2587
01:49:03,461 --> 01:49:05,892
28 times as prosecutors
and not once

2588
01:49:05,894 --> 01:49:08,592
has he deviated from
our sentencing recommendations

2589
01:49:08,594 --> 01:49:10,895
he's not gonna start now.

2590
01:49:12,961 --> 01:49:15,458
I know you've been putting this
bust together for three years

2591
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:18,825
and there's no one who doesn't
want to see mobsters go to jail

2592
01:49:18,827 --> 01:49:21,691
including and especially
the one person in the room

2593
01:49:21,693 --> 01:49:25,692
who's had one of them
put a gun in her mouth.

2594
01:49:25,694 --> 01:49:27,726
Probation, community service,
or better yet

2595
01:49:27,728 --> 01:49:29,193
just consider that all she did

2596
01:49:29,195 --> 01:49:31,292
was run a poker game
exactly the same way

2597
01:49:31,294 --> 01:49:35,961
every casino in America does
and drop the God damn charges!

2598
01:49:49,060 --> 01:49:51,395
Anything else
you'd like to add?

2599
01:49:53,327 --> 01:49:54,792
No.

2600
01:49:54,794 --> 01:49:57,095
There's nothing else
she'd like to add.

2601
01:49:58,894 --> 01:50:01,160
Uh, I'd like to talk
to Charlie in private

2602
01:50:01,162 --> 01:50:02,894
if that'd be okay with you?

2603
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:05,992
Yeah.

2604
01:50:05,994 --> 01:50:07,859
Why don't you just grab
some dinner for an hour

2605
01:50:07,861 --> 01:50:09,995
and meet me back at the office?

2606
01:50:26,294 --> 01:50:28,325
Huh? I'm sorry?

2607
01:50:28,327 --> 01:50:29,962
Did you want a hot dog?

2608
01:50:37,226 --> 01:50:39,160
I'll have a pretzel, please.

2609
01:51:13,060 --> 01:51:15,324
Here you go.

2610
01:51:15,326 --> 01:51:19,825
Hi. I would like to rent
a pair of skates, size 7.

2611
01:51:19,827 --> 01:51:22,424
But I don't have any money.

2612
01:51:22,426 --> 01:51:27,058
These are $800 dollar leather
Chanel gloves, I'll trade you.

2613
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:28,324
$800 dollar gloves?

2614
01:51:28,326 --> 01:51:31,527
And they keep hands just
as warm as the $10 dollar kind.

2615
01:51:33,261 --> 01:51:36,359
- Miss, are you alright?
- I'm fine.

2616
01:51:36,361 --> 01:51:38,425
I'm divesting.

2617
01:52:12,161 --> 01:52:14,462
- Hey, look out.
- Careful.

2618
01:52:15,461 --> 01:52:17,095
Hey, slow down.

2619
01:52:18,060 --> 01:52:20,292
Hey, miss, slow down.

2620
01:52:20,294 --> 01:52:21,559
Catch me.

2621
01:52:21,561 --> 01:52:23,395
Come on, catch me.

2622
01:52:29,995 --> 01:52:31,928
Hey, slow down!

2623
01:52:38,394 --> 01:52:40,628
- Bend your knee.
- Dad?

2624
01:52:41,426 --> 01:52:43,427
- Ah! Ah.
- Oh.

2625
01:52:44,527 --> 01:52:46,793
You alright?

2626
01:52:46,795 --> 01:52:49,462
- Sorry about that.
- I got you.

2627
01:52:50,026 --> 01:52:51,025
Sorry.

2628
01:52:51,027 --> 01:52:53,027
Takin' you off the ice
right now.

2629
01:52:57,227 --> 01:52:58,395
How's it goin'?

2630
01:53:13,261 --> 01:53:15,626
What're you doing in New York?

2631
01:53:15,628 --> 01:53:17,058
And how'd you know
I was at the skating rink?

2632
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:20,826
- I'm a doctor of the mind.
- Well, dad...

2633
01:53:20,828 --> 01:53:23,926
I'm here in New York,
because that's where you are.

2634
01:53:23,928 --> 01:53:27,726
I called your mom at the hotel
and she said you were here.

2635
01:53:27,728 --> 01:53:29,926
Listen, it's not a big deal,
but from what I saw out there

2636
01:53:29,928 --> 01:53:31,991
I think you're having
a small breakdown.

2637
01:53:31,993 --> 01:53:34,192
That's weird,
I can't think of why.

2638
01:53:34,194 --> 01:53:36,258
Probably because of the arrest
and not knowing

2639
01:53:36,260 --> 01:53:37,659
what's going to happen next.

2640
01:53:37,661 --> 01:53:40,662
Old man, do you really
not recognize sarcasm?

2641
01:53:41,894 --> 01:53:43,160
Do you?

2642
01:53:44,993 --> 01:53:46,825
Here, drink this.

2643
01:53:46,827 --> 01:53:49,124
I'm an alcoholic, I can't drink,
but thanks for remembering.

2644
01:53:49,126 --> 01:53:50,762
It's hot chocolate.

2645
01:53:51,794 --> 01:53:53,325
Okay.

2646
01:53:53,327 --> 01:53:54,892
And for diagnostic purposes

2647
01:53:54,894 --> 01:53:56,925
do you think that we're on
a cocktail lounge right now?

2648
01:53:56,927 --> 01:53:59,525
Seeing waiters
with trays of champagne?

2649
01:53:59,527 --> 01:54:01,662
Wanna check your pulse.

2650
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:09,658
- Have you found a pulse?
- Yeah.

2651
01:54:09,660 --> 01:54:11,759
Just admiring my watch.

2652
01:54:11,761 --> 01:54:13,658
I can see you're getting
warmed up, but I really

2653
01:54:13,660 --> 01:54:15,491
don't have the emotional
bandwidth to defend

2654
01:54:15,493 --> 01:54:17,525
my "as usual
irresponsible behavior."

2655
01:54:17,527 --> 01:54:19,091
I know, I got your email.

2656
01:54:19,093 --> 01:54:20,958
I get that I'm not
welcome in your life right now.

2657
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,525
As your father though,
you should know

2658
01:54:22,527 --> 01:54:24,991
I could give a shit
if I'm welcome or not.

2659
01:54:24,993 --> 01:54:28,725
But I'm not here in my capacity
as your father.

2660
01:54:28,727 --> 01:54:31,792
I'm indifferent to whether
your father lives or dies.

2661
01:54:31,794 --> 01:54:34,092
I'm a very expensive therapist
and I'm here to give you

2662
01:54:34,094 --> 01:54:35,992
one free session.

2663
01:54:35,994 --> 01:54:38,124
You think what I need
right now is a therapist?

2664
01:54:38,126 --> 01:54:41,060
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.

2665
01:54:42,993 --> 01:54:45,661
I have to be back
in my lawyer's office soon.

2666
01:54:47,226 --> 01:54:49,292
Do you like your lawyer?

2667
01:54:49,294 --> 01:54:51,592
I wasn't asking for money
when I called you, dad.

2668
01:54:51,594 --> 01:54:53,425
I just needed my dad.

2669
01:54:53,427 --> 01:54:55,759
God forbid you part
with a nickel.

2670
01:54:55,761 --> 01:54:58,525
Yeah, Tiny Tim, you grew up
on a lake and you've skied

2671
01:54:58,527 --> 01:55:00,526
all over the world,
were those work houses tough?

2672
01:55:00,528 --> 01:55:01,891
- I gotta go.
- Molly.

2673
01:55:01,893 --> 01:55:05,728
- I gotta go.
- Molly, sit the fuck down.

2674
01:55:15,827 --> 01:55:17,526
Alright, we're gonna do
three years of therapy

2675
01:55:17,528 --> 01:55:19,292
in three minutes.

2676
01:55:19,294 --> 01:55:20,591
How?

2677
01:55:20,593 --> 01:55:22,392
I'm gonna do what patients
have been begging

2678
01:55:22,394 --> 01:55:23,592
therapists to do
for a hundred years.

2679
01:55:23,594 --> 01:55:26,058
I'm just gonna give you
the answers.

2680
01:55:26,060 --> 01:55:28,258
- To what?
- Well, let's start with this.

2681
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:30,324
Why does a young woman,
who, at 22

2682
01:55:30,326 --> 01:55:34,158
has a gold-plated resume,
why does she run poker games?

2683
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:36,058
Why did I choose
to make a ton of money?

2684
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:37,258
That's a head scratcher.

2685
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:39,559
You were gonna be a success
at anything you wanted.

2686
01:55:39,561 --> 01:55:42,025
You know it. If you'd gone
to law school, you'd have...

2687
01:55:42,027 --> 01:55:44,325
You'd have owned
the law firm by now.

2688
01:55:44,327 --> 01:55:47,027
Why did you do
the other thing instead?

2689
01:55:47,660 --> 01:55:50,225
I don't know.

2690
01:55:50,227 --> 01:55:52,492
Drugs.

2691
01:55:52,494 --> 01:55:54,057
You didn't start with the drugs
until the end.

2692
01:55:54,059 --> 01:55:57,591
They weren't the problem,
they were the medicine.

2693
01:55:57,593 --> 01:56:00,594
It was so you could
control powerful men.

2694
01:56:03,260 --> 01:56:07,461
Your addiction was
having power over powerful men.

2695
01:56:11,694 --> 01:56:14,458
- Is that what you really think?
- No.

2696
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:16,025
I know it for sure.

2697
01:56:16,027 --> 01:56:18,891
You've now completed
your first year of therapy.

2698
01:56:18,893 --> 01:56:21,159
I saw an opportunity,
it wasn't about you.

2699
01:56:21,161 --> 01:56:22,992
Nah, it wasn't just about me.

2700
01:56:22,994 --> 01:56:25,894
- It wasn't at all about you.
- It was.

2701
01:56:26,728 --> 01:56:29,395
Second year, second question.

2702
01:56:32,261 --> 01:56:34,224
Do you think
you were a good husband?

2703
01:56:34,226 --> 01:56:35,726
What do you care?

2704
01:56:35,728 --> 01:56:37,525
I care because you were married
to my mother.

2705
01:56:37,527 --> 01:56:39,491
I care because
my father's an asshole.

2706
01:56:39,493 --> 01:56:41,292
Congratulations.

2707
01:56:41,294 --> 01:56:42,991
You've completed year two.

2708
01:56:42,993 --> 01:56:45,225
And for the record,
your father raised three kids

2709
01:56:45,227 --> 01:56:46,892
on a college professor's salary.

2710
01:56:46,894 --> 01:56:49,525
One of them
is a two-time Olympian

2711
01:56:49,527 --> 01:56:51,791
a sixth round draft pick
of the Philadelphia Eagles

2712
01:56:51,793 --> 01:56:54,324
and a leading philanthropist.

2713
01:56:54,326 --> 01:56:57,057
The other is a cardiothoracic
surgeon at Mass General

2714
01:56:57,059 --> 01:57:00,924
and the third managed to build
a multi million dollar business

2715
01:57:00,926 --> 01:57:03,762
using not much more
than her wits.

2716
01:57:05,594 --> 01:57:07,992
I'm about to plead guilty
in Federal Court.

2717
01:57:07,994 --> 01:57:09,725
Well, nobody's perfect.

2718
01:57:09,727 --> 01:57:12,559
The point is I did
a few things right.

2719
01:57:12,561 --> 01:57:13,958
Last question.

2720
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:15,392
No. I've to go.

2721
01:57:15,394 --> 01:57:19,428
Last question, Mol. I'll answer
it, but you have to ask it.

2722
01:57:22,226 --> 01:57:25,027
You have... to ask it.

2723
01:57:35,326 --> 01:57:38,359
Why didn't you like me
as much as my brothers?

2724
01:57:38,361 --> 01:57:40,160
There it is.

2725
01:57:42,728 --> 01:57:43,994
I did.

2726
01:57:45,661 --> 01:57:49,392
It only from time to time
appeared that I didn't.

2727
01:57:49,394 --> 01:57:51,458
It only appeared
that you didn't?

2728
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:52,591
Yeah.

2729
01:57:52,593 --> 01:57:55,592
That is some
Schedule 1 bullshit.

2730
01:57:55,594 --> 01:57:57,857
Why would...
"It only appeared..." What?

2731
01:57:57,859 --> 01:58:01,091
What? O-okay,
I had an attitude problem.

2732
01:58:01,093 --> 01:58:03,725
I talked back, I...

2733
01:58:03,727 --> 01:58:05,757
broke some normal
adolescent rules.

2734
01:58:05,759 --> 01:58:08,491
I snuck phone time after curfew

2735
01:58:08,493 --> 01:58:09,558
I took your car
when I wasn't allowed to.

2736
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:11,158
You drove it into a McDonalds.

2737
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:12,491
And kids get punished for that
but they don't...

2738
01:58:12,493 --> 01:58:13,891
Did you not see the McDonalds?

2739
01:58:13,893 --> 01:58:16,224
I mean, did you misunderstand
what drive-thru meant?

2740
01:58:16,226 --> 01:58:18,359
You'd turn into a different
person, your voice, your face...

2741
01:58:18,361 --> 01:58:20,662
It's because
I knew you knew.

2742
01:58:22,594 --> 01:58:24,559
I didn't hear what you said.

2743
01:58:24,561 --> 01:58:26,291
I said...

2744
01:58:26,293 --> 01:58:28,324
"I knew you knew."

2745
01:58:28,326 --> 01:58:29,724
You knew I knew what?

2746
01:58:29,726 --> 01:58:31,191
What do you, uh, think about

2747
01:58:31,193 --> 01:58:32,591
the following concepts?

2748
01:58:32,593 --> 01:58:35,092
Just going to run them
by you. Marriage?

2749
01:58:35,094 --> 01:58:37,425
It is a trap.

2750
01:58:37,427 --> 01:58:40,359
That I was cheating on mom.

2751
01:58:40,361 --> 01:58:41,925
I knew you knew.

2752
01:58:41,927 --> 01:58:44,690
- Society?
- It is a joke.

2753
01:58:44,692 --> 01:58:47,526
No. I didn't know
unt-until I was 20.

2754
01:58:47,528 --> 01:58:50,091
- People?
- I don't trust people.

2755
01:58:50,093 --> 01:58:52,392
No, you'd known
since you were five.

2756
01:58:52,394 --> 01:58:56,061
You saw me in my car and you
really didn't know what you saw.

2757
01:58:58,994 --> 01:59:00,761
I don't have any heroes.

2758
01:59:03,161 --> 01:59:06,994
You knew, honey, and I knew
you knew. And that's...

2759
01:59:08,793 --> 01:59:12,458
That's how I reacted
to the shame.

2760
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:15,057
And you reacted by showing...

2761
01:59:15,059 --> 01:59:17,527
seething contempt for me.

2762
01:59:18,659 --> 01:59:21,791
By driving my car
into McDonalds.

2763
01:59:21,793 --> 01:59:24,224
Wanting to have power over
powerful men?

2764
01:59:24,226 --> 01:59:25,757
No.

2765
01:59:25,759 --> 01:59:28,624
That was a red-herring
just to make you mad.

2766
01:59:28,626 --> 01:59:31,094
- You're such...
- You tripped over a stick.

2767
01:59:32,693 --> 01:59:36,259
Okay? Twelve years ago,
you tripped over a stick.

2768
01:59:36,261 --> 01:59:40,259
It was a one in a million thing.
You tripped over a stick.

2769
01:59:40,261 --> 01:59:42,558
That's what you did wrong.

2770
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:44,694
There's your session.

2771
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:52,425
It's funny how much faster
you can go

2772
01:59:52,427 --> 01:59:54,958
when you're not charging
by the hour.

2773
01:59:54,960 --> 01:59:57,492
I'm your father.

2774
01:59:57,494 --> 02:00:00,690
Trying to comprehend
how much I love you

2775
02:00:00,692 --> 02:00:03,558
would be like trying
to visualize the size

2776
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:05,494
of the universe.

2777
02:00:06,860 --> 02:00:09,225
I didn't know...

2778
02:00:09,227 --> 02:00:12,561
you'd got beaten up
until I read it in your book.

2779
02:00:14,059 --> 02:00:15,625
It was a hell of a way
to learn about it.

2780
02:00:15,627 --> 02:00:18,325
You should know
that I'm hirin' someone

2781
02:00:18,327 --> 02:00:19,458
to find the guy who did it.

2782
02:00:19,460 --> 02:00:21,424
Then, I'm hirin'
someone to kill him.

2783
02:00:21,426 --> 02:00:22,891
Don't even joke about that.

2784
02:00:22,893 --> 02:00:24,160
I'm not.

2785
02:00:26,060 --> 02:00:28,091
It wasn't a purse snatcher, dad.
It was the mafia...

2786
02:00:28,093 --> 02:00:30,058
I don't care
if it's the leader of Hamas.

2787
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:33,727
Someone put their hands
on you, they're gonna suffer.

2788
02:00:37,627 --> 02:00:40,462
- Dad, I'm fine.
- No, they're gonna suffer.

2789
02:00:41,994 --> 02:00:43,291
Dad...

2790
02:00:43,293 --> 02:00:44,991
- I'm, I'm alright.
- No.

2791
02:00:44,993 --> 02:00:46,627
They're gonna suffer.

2792
02:00:51,361 --> 02:00:53,161
Really, I'm fine.

2793
02:01:19,093 --> 02:01:21,025
- Did you know that...
- Oh!

2794
02:01:21,027 --> 02:01:22,791
I didn't see you.

2795
02:01:22,793 --> 02:01:24,259
Did you know that we know
what the center

2796
02:01:24,261 --> 02:01:27,458
of our galaxy smells like?

2797
02:01:27,460 --> 02:01:30,225
It smells like
rum and raspberries.

2798
02:01:30,227 --> 02:01:32,158
The center of the galaxy
is ethyl formate

2799
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:34,391
which is the same gas
that gives rum its smell.

2800
02:01:34,393 --> 02:01:36,590
And raspberries their taste.

2801
02:01:36,592 --> 02:01:38,292
Why do you know these things?

2802
02:01:38,294 --> 02:01:40,791
To stay busy during games,
I surfed the internet.

2803
02:01:40,793 --> 02:01:43,792
Then I started
taking online courses.

2804
02:01:43,794 --> 02:01:45,857
I'm 12 credits away
from a degree in Astronomy

2805
02:01:45,859 --> 02:01:47,994
I didn't even know
I was enrolled.

2806
02:01:50,993 --> 02:01:53,091
Hey.

2807
02:01:53,093 --> 02:01:55,760
I wanna thank you
for what you said tonight.

2808
02:01:59,527 --> 02:02:00,993
It was Stella...

2809
02:02:04,527 --> 02:02:06,690
who asked me to be your lawyer.

2810
02:02:06,692 --> 02:02:08,091
She read the book.

2811
02:02:08,093 --> 02:02:09,958
I accused her
of reading trash.

2812
02:02:09,960 --> 02:02:15,092
But she defended
the book impressively.

2813
02:02:15,094 --> 02:02:18,358
And then defended you.

2814
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:20,494
You're her role model.

2815
02:02:21,993 --> 02:02:23,927
I'm good with that.

2816
02:02:27,926 --> 02:02:30,061
There's a new offer
on the table.

2817
02:02:31,327 --> 02:02:32,490
What is it?

2818
02:02:32,492 --> 02:02:34,427
We hand over the hard drives.

2819
02:02:35,592 --> 02:02:36,792
I don't get it.

2820
02:02:36,794 --> 02:02:38,425
We hand over
the forensic imaging

2821
02:02:38,427 --> 02:02:40,259
of the emails and texts
in exchange for...

2822
02:02:40,261 --> 02:02:43,461
Exchange for, what could they
possibly offer me to do that?

2823
02:02:51,959 --> 02:02:54,394
I wrote it all down.
It's, um...

2824
02:03:02,261 --> 02:03:04,725
Your money back.

2825
02:03:04,727 --> 02:03:07,728
They'll give you all your money
back, plus interest.

2826
02:03:08,692 --> 02:03:11,490
It's over five million dollars.

2827
02:03:11,492 --> 02:03:13,960
Is that why they took it
in the first place?

2828
02:03:15,060 --> 02:03:16,557
So they could offer it
back to me?

2829
02:03:16,559 --> 02:03:18,024
Yeah. For what it's worth

2830
02:03:18,026 --> 02:03:20,058
if we went to trial,
you'd have to hand over

2831
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:21,958
the forensic imaging
and the discoveries.

2832
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:23,857
But that's different than
voluntarily handing it over...

2833
02:03:23,859 --> 02:03:26,423
Sure, but it's not really
voluntary anymore

2834
02:03:26,425 --> 02:03:28,291
when the alternative
is prison.

2835
02:03:28,293 --> 02:03:30,793
And that's what they're going
to recommend, 42 months.

2836
02:03:34,759 --> 02:03:36,491
Why do you keep breaking
eye contact with me?

2837
02:03:36,493 --> 02:03:38,691
I- I'm looking right at you.

2838
02:03:38,693 --> 02:03:40,457
You think I should do it.

2839
02:03:40,459 --> 02:03:42,024
You gotta let me keep
you out of prison.

2840
02:03:42,026 --> 02:03:43,325
You've seen
what's on those hard drives.

2841
02:03:43,327 --> 02:03:44,591
Yeah. Yeah.

2842
02:03:44,593 --> 02:03:45,657
It's a lot more
than a little color.

2843
02:03:45,659 --> 02:03:47,423
Yeah, but complete immunity.

2844
02:03:47,425 --> 02:03:48,992
Alright?
You get all your money back.

2845
02:03:48,994 --> 02:03:51,058
You'd be the first defendant
to walk out of a courtroom

2846
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:52,525
better off
than when you walked in.

2847
02:03:52,527 --> 02:03:54,558
Careers will be ruined.

2848
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:57,025
Families, wives, lives on both...

2849
02:03:57,027 --> 02:03:59,590
Hey, you know,
w- when a rich goes to jail

2850
02:03:59,592 --> 02:04:01,525
he spreads his money around,
his-his lawyer knows

2851
02:04:01,527 --> 02:04:02,992
how to take care of that.

2852
02:04:02,994 --> 02:04:05,891
He spreads his money around.
You don't have any.

2853
02:04:05,893 --> 02:04:08,791
The composition of female
inmates in a federal prison.

2854
02:04:08,793 --> 02:04:11,092
They did not commit
financial crimes.

2855
02:04:11,094 --> 02:04:13,624
They're drug dealers.
They get raped by prison guards.

2856
02:04:13,626 --> 02:04:15,092
Y- you will... You...

2857
02:04:15,094 --> 02:04:16,690
You will not be anonymous,
Molly.

2858
02:04:16,692 --> 02:04:18,192
You will be a target!

2859
02:04:18,194 --> 02:04:20,591
Children will read
their father's text messages

2860
02:04:20,593 --> 02:04:23,690
saying he wished
he'd never had kids.

2861
02:04:23,692 --> 02:04:25,758
- These guys...
- These guys, where are they?

2862
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:27,958
Why're you in this alone?
Where are your friends?

2863
02:04:27,960 --> 02:04:30,724
Where is the one guy saying,
"Hey, you know, Molly

2864
02:04:30,726 --> 02:04:32,557
"I know you're doing everything
to save my life.

2865
02:04:32,559 --> 02:04:34,691
What can I do for you?
Let me buy you a sandwich."

2866
02:04:34,693 --> 02:04:37,292
Where are they, Molly?
You kept their secrets.

2867
02:04:37,294 --> 02:04:39,259
Where are the people
you're protecting by not telling

2868
02:04:39,261 --> 02:04:40,590
the whole story in the book?

2869
02:04:40,592 --> 02:04:42,323
By settling
the Brad Marion suit.

2870
02:04:42,325 --> 02:04:44,357
By not taking
five million dollars

2871
02:04:44,359 --> 02:04:46,191
of your own money,
by going to jail!

2872
02:04:46,193 --> 02:04:47,524
Where did everybody go?

2873
02:04:47,526 --> 02:04:49,924
It's not their names
I'm protecting, Charlie.

2874
02:04:49,926 --> 02:04:51,390
- It's mine.
- Oh, that's great.

2875
02:04:51,392 --> 02:04:53,958
Well, we don't have
the luxury of integrity.

2876
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:56,124
- You have to take the deal.
- No.

2877
02:04:56,126 --> 02:04:57,957
You stay out of jail,
you get your money back.

2878
02:04:57,959 --> 02:04:58,892
You pay your debts.

2879
02:04:58,894 --> 02:05:00,124
- You start a new life!
- No.

2880
02:05:00,126 --> 02:05:01,858
Is this self-imposed punishment

2881
02:05:01,860 --> 02:05:03,792
for namin' four guys
in a book?

2882
02:05:03,794 --> 02:05:05,390
- It's not.
- You didn't do anything wrong.

2883
02:05:05,392 --> 02:05:08,958
I threw four people under
the bus for $35,000, Charlie.

2884
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:10,524
I noticed you kept that out of
your speech to the prosecutor...

2885
02:05:10,526 --> 02:05:11,924
No, don't do that to me.

2886
02:05:11,926 --> 02:05:13,457
I took advantage
of gambling addicts.

2887
02:05:13,459 --> 02:05:15,691
Donnie Silverman,
my brilliant find.

2888
02:05:15,693 --> 02:05:17,624
He lost six million dollars
on my table...

2889
02:05:17,626 --> 02:05:20,158
- Molly, stop. Stop. Uh-huh.
- Moved to Florida.

2890
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:22,124
Got a job as a substitute
teacher, then hanged himself.

2891
02:05:22,126 --> 02:05:23,892
- In his shower.
- Oh! And that's your fault.

2892
02:05:23,894 --> 02:05:25,758
- That's not your fault!
- Donnie Silverman's dead!

2893
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:28,857
Harlan Eustice is in jail
in Nevada wishing he was.

2894
02:05:28,859 --> 02:05:30,290
But that's not why
I'm saying no.

2895
02:05:30,292 --> 02:05:31,690
You're not saying no.

2896
02:05:31,692 --> 02:05:33,125
I was named
after my great grandmother.

2897
02:05:33,127 --> 02:05:35,025
- I don't care, you stay here...
- Molly Dubin Bloom...

2898
02:05:35,027 --> 02:05:36,757
- ... all night, you understand?
- ... is my name.

2899
02:05:36,759 --> 02:05:39,290
Until you understand nobody
gives a shit

2900
02:05:39,292 --> 02:05:40,390
about your good name.

2901
02:05:40,392 --> 02:05:42,192
- I do!
- Why?

2902
02:05:42,194 --> 02:05:43,391
- Because...
- Why?

2903
02:05:43,393 --> 02:05:44,891
- Because...
- Tell me why!

2904
02:05:44,893 --> 02:05:48,458
Because it's all I have left.

2905
02:05:48,460 --> 02:05:50,928
Because it's my name.

2906
02:05:54,325 --> 02:05:57,960
And I'll never have another.

2907
02:06:02,392 --> 02:06:05,092
Now, you read "The Crucible!"

2908
02:06:05,094 --> 02:06:08,291
Yeah. Everyone's right.
It's great.

2909
02:06:08,293 --> 02:06:09,728
It is great.

2910
02:06:16,927 --> 02:06:19,061
I want to go
into that courtroom...

2911
02:06:20,959 --> 02:06:22,426
and plead guilty.

2912
02:06:23,194 --> 02:06:25,828
No deals. No trades.

2913
02:06:31,026 --> 02:06:33,792
And you're very sure?

2914
02:06:33,794 --> 02:06:34,794
Yes.

2915
02:06:37,393 --> 02:06:39,091
All rise.

2916
02:06:39,093 --> 02:06:41,857
The business
of the court began.

2917
02:06:41,859 --> 02:06:45,258
We stood for the honorable
judge Dustin Foxman.

2918
02:06:45,260 --> 02:06:47,124
And counsel entered
their names for the record.

2919
02:06:47,126 --> 02:06:48,825
Assistant U.S. Attorney
Harrison Wellstone

2920
02:06:48,827 --> 02:06:50,423
for the Southern District
of New York...

2921
02:06:50,425 --> 02:06:52,558
- The docket was called.
- Docket number 1009...

2922
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:55,658
And some pro forma
instructions were given to counsel.

2923
02:06:55,660 --> 02:06:57,291
And I was asked a series
of questions

2924
02:06:57,293 --> 02:06:58,991
from a script
the judge had in front of him.

2925
02:06:58,993 --> 02:07:00,423
Molly Dubin Bloom.

2926
02:07:00,425 --> 02:07:01,524
How old are you?

2927
02:07:01,526 --> 02:07:02,924
Have you taken any drugs?

2928
02:07:02,926 --> 02:07:04,624
Medicine or pills, or had any

2929
02:07:04,626 --> 02:07:06,925
alcoholic beverages
in the past 48 hours?

2930
02:07:06,927 --> 02:07:07,857
Sudafed.

2931
02:07:07,859 --> 02:07:09,159
Is there anything about
the reasons

2932
02:07:09,161 --> 02:07:10,424
for you taking Sudafed

2933
02:07:10,426 --> 02:07:11,924
that would interfere
with what's going on...

2934
02:07:11,926 --> 02:07:13,992
87 questions
he was required to ask

2935
02:07:13,994 --> 02:07:15,924
before he'd permit me
to plead guilty.

2936
02:07:15,926 --> 02:07:17,423
Is your mind
clear today, Ms. Bloom?

2937
02:07:17,425 --> 02:07:18,792
- It is.
- Do you understand...

2938
02:07:18,794 --> 02:07:20,125
- What's going on here today?
- I do.

2939
02:07:20,127 --> 02:07:21,758
Under the constitution and laws

2940
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:23,491
of the United States,
you have a right

2941
02:07:23,493 --> 02:07:25,458
to plead to the charges
in the indictment.

2942
02:07:25,460 --> 02:07:27,423
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, Your Honor.

2943
02:07:27,425 --> 02:07:29,258
- And do you understand that?
- Yes, sir.

2944
02:07:29,260 --> 02:07:31,958
At that trial,
you would be presumed to be

2945
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:34,724
innocent and would not have
to prove that you were innocent.

2946
02:07:34,726 --> 02:07:36,558
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, sir.

2947
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:37,590
Yes, Your Honor.

2948
02:07:37,592 --> 02:07:38,625
Yes, sir.

2949
02:07:38,627 --> 02:07:40,092
If you plead guilty

2950
02:07:40,094 --> 02:07:41,558
and I accept your plea

2951
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:43,157
you will give up
your right to appeal

2952
02:07:43,159 --> 02:07:45,957
along with all other rights
I've enumerated.

2953
02:07:45,959 --> 02:07:48,525
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

2954
02:07:48,527 --> 02:07:50,190
Do you understand
that you are charged

2955
02:07:50,192 --> 02:07:53,525
in count 20 with operating
an illegal gambling business

2956
02:07:53,527 --> 02:07:56,324
in violation of Title 18
United States

2957
02:07:56,326 --> 02:07:59,424
Code Sections 1-9-5-5 and 2?

2958
02:07:59,426 --> 02:08:00,758
Yes, I understand.

2959
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:03,224
Understanding everything
you've been told

2960
02:08:03,226 --> 02:08:05,124
do you now wish
to enter a plea?

2961
02:08:05,126 --> 02:08:08,992
- Yes, sir.
- How do you plead to the charge?

2962
02:08:08,994 --> 02:08:10,427
Guilty, Your Honor.

2963
02:08:11,460 --> 02:08:14,557
Your plea has been so recorded.

2964
02:08:14,559 --> 02:08:16,190
And you may take your seat.

2965
02:08:16,192 --> 02:08:18,558
Before we move
to the sentencing phase

2966
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:20,661
I would like a word
with counsel, please.

2967
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:25,524
And then, something happened.

2968
02:08:25,526 --> 02:08:28,526
Pardon me, Mr. Jaffey,
just government counsel.

2969
02:08:31,126 --> 02:08:32,594
Yes, sir.

2970
02:08:37,060 --> 02:08:38,494
What's going on?

2971
02:08:40,225 --> 02:08:42,159
What are they doing?

2972
02:08:47,593 --> 02:08:51,028
- Wait for it.
- What?

2973
02:08:55,093 --> 02:08:57,727
Will the defendant please rise
for sentencing?

2974
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:04,525
Based on all available
information

2975
02:09:04,527 --> 02:09:06,291
this court manifestly disagrees

2976
02:09:06,293 --> 02:09:08,961
with the government's
sentencing recommendation.

2977
02:09:10,893 --> 02:09:12,724
This courthouse
is located within

2978
02:09:12,726 --> 02:09:14,725
spitting distance
of Wall Street.

2979
02:09:14,727 --> 02:09:16,691
I know this
from my personal experience

2980
02:09:16,693 --> 02:09:18,224
trying to spit at it.

2981
02:09:18,226 --> 02:09:19,824
The men and women
who work there will commit

2982
02:09:19,826 --> 02:09:21,924
more serious crimes
by lunchtime today

2983
02:09:21,926 --> 02:09:24,925
than the defendant has committed
in this indictment.

2984
02:09:24,927 --> 02:09:27,925
I simply don't see how
either the people or the cause

2985
02:09:27,927 --> 02:09:30,490
of justice are served
by locking Molly Boom in prison.

2986
02:09:30,492 --> 02:09:33,524
It was as casual as if he
was ordering lunch off a menu.

2987
02:09:33,526 --> 02:09:36,024
Ms. Bloom,
this court sentences you

2988
02:09:36,026 --> 02:09:38,223
to 200 hours
of community service.

2989
02:09:38,225 --> 02:09:40,891
One year
of supervised probation.

2990
02:09:40,893 --> 02:09:45,291
Drug testing
and a $200,000 fine.

2991
02:09:45,293 --> 02:09:47,524
This case is adjourned.

2992
02:09:47,526 --> 02:09:49,661
And that was that.

2993
02:09:50,994 --> 02:09:52,657
There was crying and hugging.

2994
02:09:52,659 --> 02:09:54,457
Jokes from my brothers.

2995
02:09:54,459 --> 02:09:58,056
Tough talk about how no one
messes with the Blooms.

2996
02:09:58,058 --> 02:10:02,024
And level-headed talk
about Christmas miracles.

2997
02:10:02,026 --> 02:10:05,057
Steaks and beer
bought by my father

2998
02:10:05,059 --> 02:10:06,557
and full reenactments.

2999
02:10:06,559 --> 02:10:08,658
And in the middle of it all

3000
02:10:08,660 --> 02:10:10,990
as grateful as you are

3001
02:10:10,992 --> 02:10:13,992
the reality starts creeping
toward you like the tide.

3002
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:19,691
And that's the first time
you have the thought.

3003
02:10:19,693 --> 02:10:22,424
What do I do know?

3004
02:10:22,426 --> 02:10:24,024
We've got a racer down!

3005
02:10:24,026 --> 02:10:25,858
We need a toboggan
and a back board!

3006
02:10:25,860 --> 02:10:28,758
I'm a felon,
I'm 35 years old

3007
02:10:28,760 --> 02:10:31,925
unemployed, and pled guilty
in a mob indictment.

3008
02:10:31,927 --> 02:10:33,825
Make way, people!
Make way!

3009
02:10:33,827 --> 02:10:35,658
Patrol here, move away!
Move away!

3010
02:10:35,660 --> 02:10:37,857
I owe the government
close to $2,000,000

3011
02:10:37,859 --> 02:10:40,657
in taxes assessed
on the civil forfeiture.

3012
02:10:40,659 --> 02:10:42,957
Plus, a $200,000 fine.

3013
02:10:42,959 --> 02:10:44,690
And you better believe
they're gonna come get it.

3014
02:10:44,692 --> 02:10:47,324
Clear a path!
Move back please!

3015
02:10:47,326 --> 02:10:49,825
I have a quarter of a million
dollars in legal bills.

3016
02:10:49,827 --> 02:10:52,158
I don't know what I'd say
in a job interview.

3017
02:10:52,160 --> 02:10:55,525
Or if I'll ever be given
a job interview.

3018
02:10:55,527 --> 02:10:57,291
I'll never be allowed
to vote again.

3019
02:10:57,293 --> 02:10:59,223
I'm going to
need a set of vitals.

3020
02:10:59,225 --> 02:11:01,457
And for some
reason, I'm not allowed

3021
02:11:01,459 --> 02:11:03,892
to go to Canada.

3022
02:11:03,894 --> 02:11:06,024
Molly, can you hear us?

3023
02:11:06,026 --> 02:11:09,757
Hips are stable.
Pelvis is stable.

3024
02:11:09,759 --> 02:11:11,224
Yeah.

3025
02:11:11,226 --> 02:11:12,825
- Her dad's here.
- What's her LOA?

3026
02:11:12,827 --> 02:11:14,557
- Uh, she's comin' around now.
- Open your eyes...

3027
02:11:14,559 --> 02:11:16,191
- If you can hear us.
- Okay, she's conscious.

3028
02:11:16,193 --> 02:11:17,990
- Molly, what day is it?
- You need to stay down, okay?

3029
02:11:17,992 --> 02:11:19,924
You need to go to a hospital.

3030
02:11:19,926 --> 02:11:21,758
What day?

3031
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:23,757
- Dad, I'm fine.
- Trust you not to move, Molly.

3032
02:11:23,759 --> 02:11:25,157
- Let go of my arm.
- You trying to get up, hon?

3033
02:11:25,159 --> 02:11:27,024
- Yeah.
- She wants to get up.

3034
02:11:27,026 --> 02:11:28,358
Our cameras
can't get in there

3035
02:11:28,360 --> 02:11:29,892
so we don't know...

3036
02:11:29,894 --> 02:11:31,158
I wonder if
Tracy's got an update

3037
02:11:31,160 --> 02:11:32,423
for us on the ground.

3038
02:11:32,425 --> 02:11:34,791
- She's moving.
- She's moving.

3039
02:11:34,793 --> 02:11:36,557
- You sure you're good?
- Yeah.

3040
02:11:36,559 --> 02:11:39,357
Okay, here we go.

3041
02:11:39,359 --> 02:11:42,890
We can see that she's
being helped to her feet now.

3042
02:11:42,892 --> 02:11:45,624
Molly Bloom is of course,
the sister of Jeremy Bloom

3043
02:11:45,626 --> 02:11:48,223
who holds the world's
number one ranking.

3044
02:11:48,225 --> 02:11:51,056
That's her long time coach
there, Ted Keene

3045
02:11:51,058 --> 02:11:52,825
and her father.

3046
02:11:52,827 --> 02:11:56,424
She came back from an injury
when she was just 13.

3047
02:11:56,426 --> 02:11:59,158
You know, you have to wonder
about the psychological toll

3048
02:11:59,160 --> 02:12:03,525
coming that close,
only to lose it like that.

3049
02:12:03,527 --> 02:12:06,290
Did anything good come of this?

3050
02:12:06,292 --> 02:12:07,493
Not really.

3051
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:13,323
But I learned
something encouraging.

3052
02:12:13,325 --> 02:12:15,391
I'm very hard to kill.

3053
02:12:15,393 --> 02:12:17,490
You and I both know
people who've never gotten over it.

3054
02:12:17,492 --> 02:12:19,691
I don't know if the
young woman we've just seen is

3055
02:12:19,693 --> 02:12:21,557
is one of those people,
we may not see her ski

3056
02:12:21,559 --> 02:12:23,825
competitively again, but I
think we're gonna see her.

3057
02:12:23,827 --> 02:12:25,890
Winston Churchill
defined success

3058
02:12:25,892 --> 02:12:28,724
as "The ability to move
from failure to failure

3059
02:12:28,726 --> 02:12:30,792
with no loss of enthusiasm."

3060
02:12:30,794 --> 02:12:33,525
So, I guess I'm pot-committed.

3061
02:12:33,527 --> 02:12:34,591
She'll be back.

3062
02:12:34,593 --> 02:12:35,624
Alright, up next at the gate

3063
02:12:35,626 --> 02:12:36,924
is Whitney Summerhill

3064
02:12:36,926 --> 02:12:39,761
who's currently
in 12th place after...
