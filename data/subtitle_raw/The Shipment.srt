190
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,730
I think it was a
great white shark.

sharks out here.

feet up in the air.

This is no ordinary shark.

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,990
What do you mean?

198
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,400
This is a flying shark.

199
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,200

All right.

203
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,670
When daddy was young,
he was navigating

204
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,760
in a small little
submarine, routine.

205
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,960
But we used to hear thumps
like that all the time.

206
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,860
And this one time, daddy's
friend Captain Ken Kennedy

207
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,345
and I decided to go up
top to check it out.

208
00:13:08,345 --> 00:13:09,970

when we got up there?

209
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,260
What did you see?

210
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,820
We saw the biggest fin.

211
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,365

like a scene from Jaws.

that thing was headed right

00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,620
for us.

215
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,970
And it was coming fast.

216
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,650
It hit the sub
with so much force

217
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,840
that it knocked Captain
into the waters.

218
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,550
Before you know it,
the shark was on him.

219
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,350

like a dog with a bone,
