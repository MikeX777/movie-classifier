1
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:10,877
There was a tremendous power of love in me, a girl.

2
00:00:11,372 --> 00:00:16,369
Now my power of love is dying.
I don't want to die.

3
00:00:26,037 --> 00:00:29,654
Hebrew subtitles: Ulpanei Elrom

4
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:53,602
My Michael

5
00:00:56,374 --> 00:00:59,968
Based on the novel of the same name by Amos Oz.

6
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:54,789
Jerusalem, 1950

7
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:35,544
What influence did Charles Dickens have on him?

8
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:39,360
Take David Copperfield's orphan, for example.

9
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:44,330
He is like Joseph the orphan from the town of Madmena
in the story of Peretz Smolenskin:

10
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:46,339
both

11
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:50,178
have endured every possible suffering.

12
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:56,809
Here's an additional detail, interesting and important,
in the work of Peretz Smolenskin -

13
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,114
Are you hurt?

14
00:02:58,149 --> 00:03:00,790
...Peretz Smolenskin's critique of society.

15
00:03:00,825 --> 00:03:08,263
We see his attitude towards man,
for example, in his story of Joseph the orphan...

16
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,544
It's cold in your Jerusalem.

17
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:16,254
What makes you think I'm from Jerusalem?

18
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:19,582
I saw you as a Jerusalemite right away.

19
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,273
They teach that in the geology department, too?

20
00:03:22,308 --> 00:03:27,902
David Copperfield is an orphan, just like Joseph the orphan,

21
00:03:27,937 --> 00:03:34,106
I've met a lot of violent people
violent people from all walks of life.

22
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:39,758
Hundreds of thousands of years ago, the sea covered the area,

23
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:42,695
The Judean mountains, Jerusalem, all that territory.

24
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,628
There are clear signs in the geologic strata,

25
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:46,773
testifying to that.

26
00:03:46,808 --> 00:03:50,597
There are fossilized fish remains, shark teeth,

27
00:03:50,632 --> 00:03:53,930
even found dinosaur footprints.

28
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:55,932
But that's not what I asked you.

29
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:59,460
I asked you how you knew
that I'm a Jerusalemite.

30
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:02,925
Look, I don't know much about you.

31
00:04:03,332 --> 00:04:08,281
I know geology better than you,
and I wanted to impress you.

32
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,487
But, uh, I don't know much about you.

33
00:04:10,522 --> 00:04:13,594
I don't know anything about you other than the fact
that you stumbled on the stairs today.

34
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:23,663
Hana, we have a beautiful apartment.
You should come.

35
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:28,249
Two large rooms, in the Rehavia neighborhood,
just above the store.

36
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:30,628
What's wrong, why are you smiling?

37
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:33,690
- Nothing.
- You got some kind of secret?

38
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:40,908
What rain!

39
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,107
- Take my gloves.
- Thank you.

40
00:04:45,397 --> 00:04:46,737
Let's go.

41
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:30,077
This is where I live.

42
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,731
I'm not inviting you for a cup of tea,
because my hostess is religious.

43
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:49,803
When I rented the room, I promised her
I wouldn't invite men over.

44
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:53,115
Good night.

45
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,965
Michael.

46
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,930
You forgot.

47
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,367
Thank you.

48
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:07,312
- Goodbye.
- Good night.

49
00:06:16,024 --> 00:06:19,421
- Hana?
- Hello, Mrs. Tarnopoler.

50
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:23,648
- Is it still raining?
- Just a little, not much.

51
00:06:23,887 --> 00:06:26,807
Sit down, I'll give you some tea.

52
00:06:26,842 --> 00:06:28,910
It's cold.

53
00:06:34,205 --> 00:06:37,141
You came home late today.

54
00:06:37,176 --> 00:06:39,170
Well?

55
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:44,351
Good morning.

56
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:45,760
Have you been waiting long?

57
00:07:45,795 --> 00:07:48,755
- No, not really.
- Let's go.

58
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:51,434
Let's go to the valley.

59
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,232
Water in the valley...

60
00:07:54,547 --> 00:07:57,361
...Deep in the earth, water dissolves ...

61
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,361
Inside is the hot core, outside is the lithosphere, -

62
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:21,310
hard rock shell.

63
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,469
Am I boring you?

64
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:31,427
No, no, no. Go on.

65
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:35,514
- What are you studying?
- Hebrew literature.

66
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,481
In the mornings, I work at a daycare center
as a teacher's aide.

67
00:08:43,414 --> 00:08:45,440
You're not a Jerusalemite?

68
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:47,816
No, I'm from Holon.

69
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:50,621
My father always wanted me to be a professor
at Jerusalem University,

70
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:53,675
because his father was a teacher in Poland.

71
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,027
Also a geologist?

72
00:08:56,062 --> 00:08:58,468
He was a teacher of the Tanakh.

73
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:03,404
Hanale received a dress as a gift from her mom.

74
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:07,180
Therefore, it was very dear to her.

75
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:18,375
However...

76
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,122
Hana.

77
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,182
- Hey. (chuckles)
- Hey. (chuckles)

78
00:09:27,506 --> 00:09:30,480
- Are you busy?
- A little.

79
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:37,445
- What are you doing?
- Preparing a play called "Hanaleh's Saturday Dress."

80
00:09:37,468 --> 00:09:40,844
Kids, let's all go see Sarah's teacher.

81
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,817
You don't want to go to Sarah's tutor?

82
00:09:48,507 --> 00:09:50,509
I'll throw you in there.

83
00:09:50,544 --> 00:09:53,745
And they will light candles and eat.....

84
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,190
Can you help me?

85
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,883
You were a spoiled brat, of course.

86
00:10:21,212 --> 00:10:23,373
That's right, indeed, I have been spoiled.

87
00:10:23,408 --> 00:10:27,481
Even the gym teacher at school
used to call me "Ganz the slacker."

88
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:33,187
If we'd met when we were kids,
you would have beaten me, of course.

89
00:10:33,222 --> 00:10:36,586
Be careful, I can beat you up now.

90
00:11:18,182 --> 00:11:20,993
I want to marry you.

91
00:11:24,638 --> 00:11:27,517
Please don't answer me now.

92
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,399
Before the war, I was playing with two Arab boys.

93
00:11:52,434 --> 00:11:59,637
I am the princess, they are my bodyguards.
I commanded them, I lorded it over them.

94
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:02,329
How far away it is.

95
00:12:29,524 --> 00:12:32,115
I'm not used to talking about it.

96
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,952
I always knew what was going on with my Michael.

97
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,260
And then, all of a sudden, surprise.

98
00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:39,466
Wedding.

99
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:46,298
You're taking away my genius, my Michael?

100
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,067
I'm just kidding.

101
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:54,292
- What are you studying at university?
- Hebrew literature. - Hebrew literature.

102
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:59,571
I have a book for you.
"Klozner's History of Hebrew Literature.

103
00:12:59,606 --> 00:13:01,818
I'll find it.

104
00:13:08,305 --> 00:13:10,476
Uh, excuse me. Just a minute.

105
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:11,628
Hello, Jehezkiel.

106
00:13:11,663 --> 00:13:14,984
They didn't. for lack of light.

107
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:16,073
Thank you.

108
00:13:16,108 --> 00:13:18,576
- Michael. - Hello.
- Hello. Hello.

109
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:21,000
I'd like you to meet her. This is Hana.

110
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:23,077
- This is Aunt Zhenya. - How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

111
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:25,560
Hello, Aunt Batia.
Please meet Hana.

112
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:27,830
Hello, Dvora.

113
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:32,003
- This is Hana. - Nice to meet you.
- Dvora.

114
00:13:32,038 --> 00:13:37,409
Mr. Kadishman, a friend of the family.
He found out that you come from a good family.

115
00:13:37,444 --> 00:13:39,776
Let's go in the other room.

116
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:43,590
Go sit down.

117
00:13:46,234 --> 00:13:48,130
See also.

118
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:52,864
You do know that Michael's father
is a small official in the municipality.

119
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,152
And his financial situation is pretty dire.

120
00:13:55,187 --> 00:13:58,776
He spends most of his paycheck
on Michael's education.

121
00:13:59,265 --> 00:14:04,183
Obviously, there's no way the family would agree
for him to drop out of school.

122
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:08,862
I'm going to let myself ask you an intimate question.

123
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:21,309
Did something happen
that the wedding can't be postponed?

124
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:25,090
No.

125
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,466
Then what's the rush?

126
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:33,107
I was engaged for six years
before I married my first husband.

127
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:35,867
Can't you wait a year?

128
00:14:39,654 --> 00:14:45,556
Know that financial difficulties
in the beginning of your life together can ruin it.

129
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:52,624
Right, within a month, two months,
sex supersedes all other problems.

130
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,345
But what happens then?

131
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,624
Our Michael is still in the clouds.

132
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:01,470
A genius in science and an infant in life.

133
00:15:01,505 --> 00:15:07,596
- What does your mother say about it?
- We're not going to see her until tomorrow.

134
00:15:08,213 --> 00:15:10,150
All right. Uh-huh.

135
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:17,969
Michael.

136
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:20,357
Sit down, please.

137
00:15:23,314 --> 00:15:26,893
- Do you have a suit for the wedding?
- Uh, no.

138
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:29,219
There's Joseph's costume.

139
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:33,267
It needs a little adjustment.
There's not much difference in size.

140
00:15:33,302 --> 00:15:35,003
No need to.

141
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:37,806
Hanche, why don't you say anything?

142
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:41,860
A girl is about to get married,
and a face like the Ninth of Av.

143
00:15:41,895 --> 00:15:44,788
Hanele is a gentle girl.

144
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:47,637
Take care of her.

145
00:15:47,672 --> 00:15:50,217
There's a lot of pain in it.

146
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:54,564
Doba, what do they want?

147
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:57,602
- They want to see the apartment...
- Is the apartment furnished?

148
00:15:57,637 --> 00:16:02,996
- Part of it, left over... - Can I see it?
- It's right here, please.

149
00:16:09,811 --> 00:16:14,132
- This place is quiet. - It is.
- Most of the neighbors here are religious.

150
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:18,146
A little noise from the yeshiva, but not terrible.

151
00:16:18,181 --> 00:16:22,021
- It's not critical. Not critical.
- It's good.

152
00:16:22,056 --> 00:16:24,855
You can see the furniture. Not much left.

153
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,204
No bed or table.

154
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,163
That's it.

155
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:33,014
My name is Glick. I live across the street here.

156
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:37,684
When you're done, please close the blinds
and bring me the key.

157
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:39,896
- All right. Uh-huh.
- And if you're interested, let me know.

158
00:16:39,931 --> 00:16:41,321
Then I'll tell the master.

159
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,741
- All right. Uh-huh. Thank you very much.
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

160
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,697
Tomorrow we'll buy furniture, get a bed,
clean up the apartment.

161
00:17:01,131 --> 00:17:03,098
Hedgehog.

162
00:17:16,773 --> 00:17:18,776
What about this table?

163
00:17:18,811 --> 00:17:21,871
It is what it is.

164
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:24,122
- You can't include the table in the price?
- Uh, no.

165
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:26,728
- But, I can't buy...
- If you can't buy it, don't buy it.

166
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:27,768
But, how much do you want for it?

167
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:30,369
I'll put the price here: 60 liras.

168
00:17:30,404 --> 00:17:34,378
- 60 lire a table? - This one's 100.
- 100 lira is a lot of money....

169
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:38,496
That's a lot of money, that's what I want.
100 lire, 100 lire.

170
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,278
If you, Mrs. Hana, scream at night.
two days before the wedding,

171
00:18:18,313 --> 00:18:21,927
it's clear that this is a sure sign
of some great misfortune. God forbid!

172
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:24,937
If I were your mother,
I wouldn't let you suddenly jump into marriage.

173
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:28,777
for some stranger
who happened to meet him on the street.

174
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:32,846
I mean, you could have accidentally met
a completely different person.

175
00:18:34,601 --> 00:18:37,474
You're getting married like life
is a Purim carnival.

176
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:42,189
A girl meets a stranger,
without knowing what he's made of,

177
00:18:42,224 --> 00:18:46,706
she makes arrangements with him; she sets her own wedding day,
as if there were no one else in the world but her.

178
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:49,612
I got married by matchmaking.

179
00:18:59,374 --> 00:19:01,041
Congratulations!

180
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:09,784
Congratulations! Where's Hana?

181
00:19:10,506 --> 00:19:13,046
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!
- Meet my mom.

182
00:19:13,081 --> 00:19:14,569
Congratulations!

183
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,923
- Michael, let's dance. - No, we're not.
- Let's go dancing.

184
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:07,440
Hanaleh took pity on him
and offered to help him.

185
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:10,484
When Hanale finished helping the coal miner,

186
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,725
she suddenly realized that her entire dress
was blackened with coal dust.

187
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,679
The beautiful new dress her mom made her,

188
00:21:17,714 --> 00:21:21,243
was covered in black spots.

189
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:25,474
Hanaleh was very unhappy,
and shed bitter tears.

190
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:28,686
And, uh, here's what happened, kids.

191
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:35,088
Suddenly a multitude of stars descended from the sky.
and, instead of dirty coal stains,

192
00:21:35,123 --> 00:21:38,167
gold stars appeared on Hanaleh's dress.

193
00:21:38,202 --> 00:21:40,968
Hanaleh is no longer afraid to go home.

194
00:21:41,003 --> 00:21:44,997
She runs straight to her mom and shows her
what a miracle has happened to her.

195
00:21:45,032 --> 00:21:47,352
Mom is very happy along with Hanaleh.

196
00:23:08,712 --> 00:23:11,094
- Michael.
- What?

197
00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:12,561
- Michael.
- What?

198
00:23:12,596 --> 00:23:15,136
I'm pregnant.

199
00:23:15,421 --> 00:23:20,077
- What?
- I'm pregnant.

200
00:23:21,537 --> 00:23:23,766
Are you sure about this?

201
00:23:33,321 --> 00:23:35,215
Hana.

202
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:41,075
When she eats, she has here.....
She doesn't swallow her pee,

203
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,464
she has here, inside.

204
00:23:43,499 --> 00:23:48,189
under the neck, there are two small pockets.

205
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,758
She pecks grains and fills her pockets.

206
00:23:51,793 --> 00:23:53,485
Gradually it's getting thicker and thicker.

207
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,836
Why? Because she's hoarding.
Do you know what "hoarding" means?

208
00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:58,539
It's collecting.

209
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,740
Hana.

210
00:24:02,196 --> 00:24:05,225
Gianni, hello.

211
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,008
- Hello. - I'm sorry I didn't call
Michael at work that you were coming,

212
00:24:08,043 --> 00:24:10,273
we would have left you a key.

213
00:24:13,381 --> 00:24:15,570
- Have you been waiting long?
- No, I haven't.

214
00:24:15,605 --> 00:24:17,457
Michael hasn't gotten home from work yet.

215
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:20,805
It's a good thing he's not here. I want to talk to you.

216
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:24,986
Come on in. I'll just take the groceries to the kitchen.

217
00:24:29,706 --> 00:24:31,546
We're settling in nicely.

218
00:24:45,094 --> 00:24:48,064
Come on, Hana, sit down, I want to talk to you.

219
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:50,533
We can sit over there.

220
00:25:00,878 --> 00:25:05,143
I heard this morning.
I left everything and came to Jerusalem.

221
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:09,542
Michael told me about your situation.

222
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:12,885
I don't understand you.

223
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,222
Why now?

224
00:25:16,073 --> 00:25:20,523
It's so bad timing, it'll ruin everything.

225
00:25:24,109 --> 00:25:27,354
Michael's exams ...

226
00:25:28,598 --> 00:25:31,055
Why don't you put it off?

227
00:25:32,126 --> 00:25:34,211
Like a child.

228
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,122
I'm sorry I came. I should have known.

229
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:46,076
It's just a 20-minute surgery,
like ripping out tonsils.

230
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:49,273
Hana.

231
00:25:51,412 --> 00:25:54,442
Wait, let me finish.

232
00:25:54,973 --> 00:25:57,093
I didn't mean...

233
00:25:57,128 --> 00:25:59,042
Don't think I'm mean.

234
00:25:59,077 --> 00:26:01,505
I think my suggestion makes sense.

235
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,261
If so, you can plan for it.

236
00:26:07,372 --> 00:26:11,342
Michael, why don't you say anything to her?

237
00:26:18,483 --> 00:26:22,786
You're standing there like a statue.
Okay, I'm leaving.

238
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:57,093
It's his silence... Silence.

239
00:26:57,128 --> 00:27:02,261
I'd get up now and leave immediately,
without even changing my dress.

240
00:27:02,296 --> 00:27:04,749
I'd get up and leave.

241
00:27:05,596 --> 00:27:09,791
Sometimes I wonder what I see in that man.

242
00:27:09,826 --> 00:27:12,385
What I know about him.

243
00:27:12,856 --> 00:27:18,186
If I had met someone else,
would the same thing happen?

244
00:27:49,783 --> 00:27:51,765
Michael.

245
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:57,246
We're like two strangers on the same bench
on a long train ride,

246
00:27:57,281 --> 00:28:02,621
must be polite,
be courteous, be courteous, be courteous, be courteous.

247
00:28:06,464 --> 00:28:12,243
I feel like something big
is about to happen. I'm waiting.

248
00:28:12,278 --> 00:28:15,517
Something has to happen on this trip.

249
00:28:15,552 --> 00:28:18,128
I'm waiting.

250
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,782
You're diligent.

251
00:28:59,086 --> 00:29:01,245
You don't have to mock me.

252
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:05,749
Villain.

253
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:10,466
Hana, you know it's stupid.

254
00:29:18,977 --> 00:29:23,361
- Do I look ugly to you?
- Hana.

255
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:26,123
So, why aren't you hugging me?

256
00:29:29,408 --> 00:29:31,735
Hana, indeed...

257
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:36,481
Have you forgotten what you asked for this morning?
You asked me not to touch you.

258
00:29:36,516 --> 00:29:39,066
I'm not touching you.

259
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,800
Hana, don't cry.

260
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,225
You know I love you.

261
00:30:12,088 --> 00:30:14,730
Tell me, what annoys you?

262
00:30:14,765 --> 00:30:17,632
So I don't make the same mistake again.

263
00:30:17,667 --> 00:30:19,321
Have a drink.

264
00:30:34,886 --> 00:30:37,677
- How's it going?
- Do you care?

265
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:42,074
Hana.

266
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:45,519
Hana, you know it's really hard for me too....

267
00:30:45,805 --> 00:30:47,977
It's not easy for me either.

268
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,387
I didn't think it was easy for you.

269
00:30:56,226 --> 00:30:58,391
Hana.

270
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:03,107
- Hana.
- What?

271
00:31:06,104 --> 00:31:08,707
You don't love me anymore?

272
00:31:10,594 --> 00:31:13,737
I'm sad. That's all.

273
00:31:22,246 --> 00:31:24,934
I'll take her now to the hospital in Tel Aviv.

274
00:31:24,969 --> 00:31:27,072
I'm the deputy chief of pediatrics,

275
00:31:27,107 --> 00:31:30,077
and I have every right
to demand responsible behavior.

276
00:31:30,112 --> 00:31:34,119
This is a hospital? It's a disgrace!
It's like some Asian hospital!

277
00:31:35,334 --> 00:31:41,166
Maybe I'm asking too much,
but I would ask you

278
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:46,405
to name him Zalman,
in honor of your grandfather, Michael.

279
00:31:47,768 --> 00:31:51,548
I propose that we put on the birth certificate
a double name--

280
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:54,432
Yair Zalman.

281
00:31:55,184 --> 00:31:57,858
The decision is yours.

282
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:10,577
Remember, other than the calcium tablets,
don't agree to take anything.

283
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:49,602
Yair, Zalman...

284
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:51,570
Quiet.

285
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:12,188
I saw that you were still awake,
and I thought that maybe, uh.

286
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,164
I work in the bedroom.

287
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:19,400
If you need anything, let me know.

288
00:33:19,923 --> 00:33:21,742
Good night.

289
00:33:52,301 --> 00:33:54,629
Come on, let it be sweet.

290
00:34:45,604 --> 00:34:49,693
The days are the same. Nothing happens.

291
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,765
Michael and I don't talk much.

292
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,303
Mostly silent.

293
00:34:55,534 --> 00:34:59,768
An outsider might think
we're at peace.

294
00:35:00,202 --> 00:35:03,316
The days are just like one another.

295
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:59,006
It's going to take some more time.

296
00:37:05,483 --> 00:37:06,685
Hi.

297
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,417
Tzion. Can you replace me?

298
00:37:09,452 --> 00:37:11,774
Come on, Hana, let's go out for a while.

299
00:37:13,656 --> 00:37:16,370
I'd like you to meet me. Hana, this is Tzion,
a friend of mine from work.

300
00:37:16,405 --> 00:37:17,549
- This is Hana, my wife.
- Nice to meet you, Tzion.

301
00:37:17,584 --> 00:37:20,035
Keep dividing. And then cook...

302
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,186
- Okay? - All right.
- Let's go outside.

303
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:29,069
All sections of the doctoral dissertation ...

304
00:37:29,104 --> 00:37:31,667
It's hard, but I'm making progress.

305
00:37:39,844 --> 00:37:42,706
- You want part of a sandwich?
- Uh, no.

306
00:37:44,678 --> 00:37:47,034
Everything for my father.

307
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,535
I really hope he's still honored
to write on letter envelopes:

308
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:59,447
"To Dr. Michael Gonen."
It's important to my father.

309
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,527
Never take anything from people
you don't know.

310
00:39:09,562 --> 00:39:10,981
Was it a bad man?

311
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:14,277
Yair, maybe this man
was wounded in the war.

312
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,435
Maybe he's a hero.

313
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,846
He wasn't a hero, he was a bad man.

314
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:21,240
Stop talking.

315
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:24,807
I'll eat a cookie and die to you.

316
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:30,159
- You'll never die.
- Stop this nonsense. We're done.

317
00:40:07,787 --> 00:40:11,832
- Mom, Dad. - Good morning.
- Zalman and Zalman are back.

318
00:40:12,178 --> 00:40:14,621
Good morning.

319
00:40:14,967 --> 00:40:16,750
Good morning.

320
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:19,855
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

321
00:41:43,287 --> 00:41:48,289
When I was a girl, we lived in Kiryat Shmuel,
on the border of the Katamon neighborhood.

322
00:41:48,324 --> 00:41:53,558
Near us, at the foot of the hill, stood the house of an Arab,

323
00:41:53,593 --> 00:41:56,277
Rashida Shahada.

324
00:41:56,312 --> 00:42:02,740
I played with his kids--
two twin boys.

325
00:42:03,386 --> 00:42:06,113
I was in love with both of them.

326
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,364
The war separated us.

327
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:42,454
Don't worry, Hana.

328
00:42:42,697 --> 00:42:44,858
It'll all be over soon.

329
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,645
I think this is a military exercise.

330
00:42:49,265 --> 00:42:53,103
- Where's the sweater?
- In my backpack. - Oh, good.

331
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:57,877
- Dad. - What? When are you coming back?
- In a few days.

332
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:00,978
Goodbye, Yair. Take care of mom.

333
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:09,028
It's a shame I have to leave now,
when you're not feeling well.

334
00:43:09,332 --> 00:43:11,584
Goodbye.

335
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:16,338
Don't worry. I'm just a communications guy.
Not a paratrooper.

336
00:43:19,304 --> 00:43:21,352
Bye.

337
00:43:40,055 --> 00:43:42,176
Are they coming again?

338
00:43:42,211 --> 00:43:44,787
What do they want from me?

339
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:48,733
Why? Why didn't they...

340
00:43:49,147 --> 00:43:52,710
I don't want to...

341
00:43:54,348 --> 00:43:56,777
I don't want to...

342
00:43:57,027 --> 00:44:01,830
Kids, what do you want me to do?

343
00:44:01,865 --> 00:44:04,283
I don't want to...

344
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:08,337
Why did they come again?

345
00:44:09,078 --> 00:44:11,451
Why...

346
00:44:13,267 --> 00:44:18,115
Again today... Gleek...

347
00:44:18,604 --> 00:44:21,211
What, what...

348
00:44:21,246 --> 00:44:22,946
Doba, come here.

349
00:44:23,136 --> 00:44:26,673
- Let's go home.
- Why again?

350
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,913
Army forces defeated Arab terrorists,
captured Kuntila and Ras al-Naqel,

351
00:44:31,948 --> 00:44:36,787
have taken up positions west of the junction of the roads
at Nahel, east of the Suez Canal.

352
00:44:36,822 --> 00:44:39,646
This operation exposed the vulnerability
of the Egyptian army

353
00:44:39,681 --> 00:44:44,351
"and was a retaliatory strike against the violation
of the vital peace of the citizens of Israel."

354
00:45:01,942 --> 00:45:05,208
Excuse me, Mrs. Gonen, is your husband home?

355
00:45:05,243 --> 00:45:07,830
No, he was drafted.

356
00:45:08,644 --> 00:45:11,331
I don't know what to do.

357
00:45:11,594 --> 00:45:14,269
She's been different lately.

358
00:45:14,304 --> 00:45:16,584
My wife, Doba.

359
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:18,741
She's not well.

360
00:45:18,776 --> 00:45:24,928
You know what I mean? She threw a candlestick at me
with a burning candle. On Saturday.

361
00:45:26,789 --> 00:45:31,393
So, I thought maybe
your husband could tell me what to do.

362
00:46:31,196 --> 00:46:33,497
- Hello, Mrs. Gonen. We've come to visit you.
- How do you do?

363
00:46:33,532 --> 00:46:36,962
- We heard you were sick.
- No, nothing, just a little weak.

364
00:46:36,997 --> 00:46:39,837
Come in, please, come in.

365
00:46:43,219 --> 00:46:47,268
- Where's Yair?
- He's at my friend Hadassah's.

366
00:46:50,097 --> 00:46:53,388
It's very nice of you to stop by.

367
00:46:56,527 --> 00:46:58,165
We thought maybe we could help in some way.

368
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,561
Perhaps Mrs. Gonen will allow me
go into the kitchen and make her tea?

369
00:47:01,596 --> 00:47:05,239
No, no, thank you,
I'll get up and make you something.

370
00:47:05,549 --> 00:47:09,148
Have you heard from Michael?

371
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,357
No.

372
00:47:11,647 --> 00:47:14,629
There's no need to worry, Mrs. Gonen.

373
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:20,571
In these great days, I think, although the disciples of Zeev Jabotinsky

374
00:47:20,606 --> 00:47:23,220
have been pushed out of key positions,

375
00:47:23,255 --> 00:47:28,288
but today his teachings are celebrating a great victory.

376
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:32,899
The State of Israel will henceforth change its image.

377
00:47:45,361 --> 00:47:50,296
- How's Doba doing?
- The doctor says there's hope.

378
00:47:51,951 --> 00:47:56,439
- Why are you sitting in your coat?
- We were just leaving.

379
00:47:57,204 --> 00:47:58,749
We're leaving.

380
00:47:59,029 --> 00:48:00,915
A speedy and speedy recovery.

381
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:04,716
Are you leaving already? Am I boring you?

382
00:48:04,978 --> 00:48:08,984
When Michael comes back,
I'll come play chess with him.

383
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,487
Thank you very much.

384
00:48:17,684 --> 00:48:19,061
Uh, hello?

385
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:20,761
Michael Gonen.

386
00:48:20,796 --> 00:48:22,887
Yes.

387
00:48:22,922 --> 00:48:26,481
Military Post 2801.

388
00:48:27,081 --> 00:48:29,080
Yes...

389
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:31,113
Uh, excuse me.

390
00:48:31,148 --> 00:48:34,037
Hello? The military commissioner?

391
00:48:34,072 --> 00:48:37,406
Yes... Michael Gonen.

392
00:48:37,441 --> 00:48:39,035
Yes?

393
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:42,780
But I haven't gotten anything from him since the war started.

394
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:47,151
I understand.

395
00:48:47,545 --> 00:48:49,566
All right. Uh-huh.

396
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,895
Thank you.

397
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,656
- What do you want with my baby?
- What does he want from me?

398
00:50:03,691 --> 00:50:04,953
What did he do to you?

399
00:50:04,988 --> 00:50:08,327
Crazy...

400
00:50:09,945 --> 00:50:11,158
What did he do to you?

401
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:12,924
- Leave it.
- Leave him.

402
00:50:12,959 --> 00:50:15,298
You should go to jail.

403
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:19,106
- What did she do to you?
- Crazy.

404
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,760
Let's go.

405
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:24,607
Come on, come on.

406
00:50:24,642 --> 00:50:27,260
You're gonna lie down for a while, you're gonna lie down.

407
00:50:36,545 --> 00:50:38,470
Michael?

408
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:44,100
Dad.

409
00:50:44,118 --> 00:50:45,599
Did you kill Arabs?

410
00:50:45,634 --> 00:50:49,012
No, Yair, the Jewish army almost got me
almost got me killed.

411
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:52,185
I feel almost like a war hero
from a Soviet movie.

412
00:51:01,052 --> 00:51:04,974
Such a man, for no reason, fell on the sidewalk.

413
00:51:05,009 --> 00:51:07,648
What's the point of this?

414
00:51:08,515 --> 00:51:13,449
And the formalities of the funeral
as if he were going abroad.

415
00:51:27,546 --> 00:51:31,426
It reminds me of a game
we used to play when we were kids.

416
00:51:31,461 --> 00:51:36,028
They'd line up in a long line, and the first one to throw the ball,
would run to the end of the line and be the last one out.

417
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:39,205
And so it went on and on
until the last one became the first one.

418
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,704
I don't remember who was considered the winner or why.

419
00:51:45,003 --> 00:51:47,950
Dad's dead. I'm the father now.

420
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:57,033
Yair.

421
00:51:57,668 --> 00:52:00,193
Again? What's wrong?

422
00:52:00,414 --> 00:52:01,636
What's wrong?

423
00:52:01,671 --> 00:52:04,835
The guys got mad. There was a fight, that's all.

424
00:52:12,206 --> 00:52:15,395
Yair, pet him. Okay.

425
00:52:15,485 --> 00:52:20,275
Every living creature needs affection and love.

426
00:52:28,508 --> 00:52:30,927
I love his restraint.

427
00:52:30,962 --> 00:52:34,579
But, I wish it would explode.

428
00:52:34,614 --> 00:52:36,331
I can still summon them,

429
00:52:36,366 --> 00:52:39,532
twins,
just like when we were kids,

430
00:52:39,567 --> 00:52:44,929
to come and take me,
to bring back the feeling of pain, of love.

431
00:53:04,267 --> 00:53:09,849
I once wanted to meet a man who was strong,
who could hardly control himself.

432
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:12,812
I'm not comparing.

433
00:54:03,457 --> 00:54:05,546
What are you saying...

434
00:54:07,072 --> 00:54:11,442
An egg, a tough egg.
Thought it would make a chicken.

435
00:54:47,973 --> 00:54:50,210
Joram is now studying for his exams,

436
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:53,914
and private lessons could help him, no doubt.

437
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:57,804
Mr. Gonen told me that you
studied Hebrew literature at the university.

438
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,780
That's right, it was a long time ago.

439
00:54:59,815 --> 00:55:03,370
Maybe you could
give him some of your time.

440
00:55:03,405 --> 00:55:08,709
Uh, okay. I'm usually free on Tuesdays,
after lunch.

441
00:55:08,744 --> 00:55:11,686
- Regarding payment...
- No, you don't.

442
00:55:11,721 --> 00:55:14,833
- We can't make demands of you.
- Maybe we can work it out somehow.

443
00:55:14,868 --> 00:55:17,957
Joram will be able to watch over Yair
as we leave.

444
00:55:17,992 --> 00:55:20,572
- Joram?
- Of course.

445
00:55:20,607 --> 00:55:23,420
- Next Tuesday, then? Would that be okay?
- It's fine.

446
00:55:23,455 --> 00:55:26,415
- Thank you very much, Mrs. Gonen. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

447
00:55:29,285 --> 00:55:31,934
Why do you always have your hands up?

448
00:55:33,414 --> 00:55:35,958
I'm explaining it to you. You can't, but it's okay.

449
00:55:35,993 --> 00:55:38,620
We'll start over, no big deal.

450
00:55:38,655 --> 00:55:41,025
I don't understand, don't give in.

451
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:41,892
Hana, I'm telling you,

452
00:55:41,927 --> 00:55:44,432
I received the journal of the British
of the Geological Society.

453
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:46,296
There's an article printed there by a professor from Cambridge,

454
00:55:46,331 --> 00:55:49,845
laying out an exciting new theory
of erosion processes.

455
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,902
He refutes everything I wrote.

456
00:55:50,937 --> 00:55:53,275
I'm forced to start my doctoral dissertation all over again.

457
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:56,527
Don't give in. Prove to that Englishman that you're right.

458
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:58,840
I can't. I'm explaining it to you.

459
00:55:59,991 --> 00:56:01,867
Why are you like this?

460
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,732
Hana, not possible. He's right, I'm convinced.

461
00:56:05,767 --> 00:56:07,821
You raise your hands.

462
00:56:10,312 --> 00:56:13,801
The British were forced to leave Israel.

463
00:56:13,836 --> 00:56:16,393
We made them.

464
00:56:22,736 --> 00:56:27,268
"In the flow of the cool waves you can see
"the whole surrounding landscape.

465
00:56:27,303 --> 00:56:31,039
Like a mirror, reflecting the jungle that has invaded it.

466
00:56:31,686 --> 00:56:36,103
Kill. Love.
In the tangles of life

467
00:56:36,138 --> 00:56:39,295
I wouldn't be tempted.

468
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:44,222
I'm enchanted by this island."

469
00:56:44,462 --> 00:56:46,881
Joram, are you here?

470
00:56:47,397 --> 00:56:50,931
- Yeah.
- I thought you were already on a faraway island,

471
00:56:50,966 --> 00:56:52,408
like our hero.

472
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:54,502
No, I'm listening.

473
00:56:54,825 --> 00:56:56,831
Focus.

474
00:56:58,491 --> 00:57:01,136
"It's not foreseeable that anyone would take
"seriously

475
00:57:01,171 --> 00:57:04,525
to his tropical reverie.

476
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,220
And there was no point in hurting his feelings.

477
00:57:07,255 --> 00:57:10,376
Powerful people don't show up in places so dangerous,

478
00:57:10,411 --> 00:57:12,479
where I ended up.

479
00:57:12,514 --> 00:57:14,111
On the nights of the full moon..."

480
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:18,724
Everyone was wondering when the English would leave the country,

481
00:57:18,759 --> 00:57:21,297
- the final release will come.
- Yeah.

482
00:57:21,332 --> 00:57:25,128
And so, they left the country, thank God,

483
00:57:25,163 --> 00:57:28,151
- and the Messiah hasn't come yet.
- Yes, he is.

484
00:57:48,371 --> 00:57:51,463
Honey, your husband helped me solve a problem
that I couldn't solve for six months.

485
00:57:51,464 --> 00:57:53,189
I really don't know how to thank you.

486
00:57:53,224 --> 00:57:55,880
Okay, see you Thursday.

487
00:57:56,268 --> 00:57:58,227
Goodbye.

488
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:11,161
Mom.

489
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,410
Mom.

490
00:58:15,641 --> 00:58:20,060
- What does the cat want?
- He wants to eat and sleep.

491
00:58:20,326 --> 00:58:22,489
Shall I get him a blanket?

492
00:58:22,746 --> 00:58:26,523
No, silly, cats don't need blankets.

493
00:58:26,778 --> 00:58:28,489
Why?

494
00:58:29,871 --> 00:58:33,821
Okay. Ask your dad. Dad's smarter than that.

495
00:58:33,856 --> 00:58:35,400
- Dad.
- What?

496
00:58:35,435 --> 00:58:38,007
Why don't cats need blankets?

497
00:58:38,042 --> 00:58:39,931
Look at this.

498
00:58:40,547 --> 00:58:42,820
See, he's got warm fur.

499
00:58:42,855 --> 00:58:49,097
Pet him, Yair. Every living thing
needs affection and love.

500
00:58:53,966 --> 00:58:55,810
Read.

501
00:59:04,255 --> 00:59:07,671
A religious young man writes poems about love?

502
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:45,521
- I've got a little work left, and then.
- Hello. - Hello. (chuckles)

503
00:59:45,556 --> 00:59:48,000
I'm gonna go work in the bedroom, okay?

504
00:59:48,035 --> 00:59:51,934
- Was everything okay?
- Yeah, fine. He slept the whole time.

505
00:59:54,881 --> 00:59:57,333
My shoes are too tight.

506
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:04,423
- Finished reading the book?
- There are still 3 more chapters to go.

507
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:08,403
I hope you finish reading before your next class.

508
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,812
- Good night.
- Good night.

509
01:00:30,396 --> 01:00:33,432
Joram, hello. Where are you going?

510
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:37,557
- To the youth movement club.
- We're going to fix Yair's teeth.

511
01:00:41,439 --> 01:00:43,474
Let's go.

512
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:24,489
- Take it, Joram. - No, thank you.
- Take it.

513
01:01:24,524 --> 01:01:27,016
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

514
01:02:03,671 --> 01:02:06,725
You have beautiful eyes, you know?

515
01:02:09,129 --> 01:02:11,107
Mrs. Gonen.

516
01:02:11,142 --> 01:02:14,064
Do I look like an ancient old woman to you?

517
01:02:14,395 --> 01:02:19,038
- Mrs. Gonen.
- Hana. You can call me Hana.

518
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:27,594
The varieties are listed
in order of decreasing concentration...

519
01:02:28,126 --> 01:02:30,021
"Bastard, your boy,

520
01:02:30,056 --> 01:02:32,997
standing there looking at me like a little man.

521
01:02:33,032 --> 01:02:37,852
- Mom, I'm going to play.
- Okay, Yair.

522
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:44,056
Information on the topic is summarized in Table 1.

523
01:02:44,091 --> 01:02:47,682
I see that I have to go through all of this myself.

524
01:02:47,717 --> 01:02:51,292
We started school together. You're done, and I'm stuck
on some stupid final paper,

525
01:02:51,327 --> 01:02:53,212
I'm just embarrassed.

526
01:02:53,247 --> 01:02:54,185
You helped me out.

527
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:57,026
Let's go to the other room
so we can keep working.

528
01:02:57,061 --> 01:02:59,450
Sweetie, you wouldn't get turned on
if I steal your man for half an hour?

529
01:02:59,485 --> 01:03:01,006
He needs to explain Davis to me.

530
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:05,078
Take it. For free. As a gift. Along with your Davis.

531
01:03:05,998 --> 01:03:08,115
Don't be sad.

532
01:03:24,188 --> 01:03:28,063
Michael, there's two of us, we're not one.

533
01:03:28,098 --> 01:03:33,066
There will always be two of us.
That's what's so awful.

534
01:03:33,683 --> 01:03:38,700
Understand, Michael, nothing depends
on you or me.

535
01:03:38,735 --> 01:03:43,105
It's hard for me to explain. Even the words resist me.

536
01:04:02,256 --> 01:04:05,046
I think I put it here.

537
01:04:05,346 --> 01:04:07,929
It's in the corner here, of course.

538
01:04:08,569 --> 01:04:10,460
Just a minute.

539
01:04:12,404 --> 01:04:15,198
Don't be afraid, Joram, come in.

540
01:04:18,173 --> 01:04:22,098
- Mrs. Gonen.
- What?

541
01:04:53,826 --> 01:04:55,948
Mrs. Gonen.

542
01:04:57,222 --> 01:05:01,746
One more time to ten. And she'll be ready. Loudly.

543
01:05:01,781 --> 01:05:05,665
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

544
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:09,079
Now look and get stamps.

545
01:05:17,171 --> 01:05:20,744
Careful with the teeth of the stamps, okay?

546
01:05:21,931 --> 01:05:23,982
- Daddy.
- Yeah?

547
01:05:24,017 --> 01:05:27,468
- I'll cut it off.
- I'll cut it off.

548
01:05:29,779 --> 01:05:32,132
Give it to me, I'll put it in.

549
01:05:32,964 --> 01:05:34,807
Michael.

550
01:05:34,842 --> 01:05:36,670
Thank you.

551
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:39,625
Here you go.

552
01:05:39,905 --> 01:05:43,090
Slowly, carefully, gently.

553
01:05:43,819 --> 01:05:48,517
- Dad. - What? There's a row of one country,
and a row of another country.

554
01:05:48,552 --> 01:05:50,279
- Stamps.
- That's right.

555
01:05:50,314 --> 01:05:54,352
- Same brand, here.
- Same stamp? Okay, put it down.

556
01:05:55,492 --> 01:05:57,908
See how I put it in. You want to put it in?

557
01:05:58,084 --> 01:06:00,194
Go ahead, put it in here.

558
01:06:02,306 --> 01:06:04,062
That's great!

559
01:06:06,248 --> 01:06:09,421
- One country.
- One country.

560
01:06:10,618 --> 01:06:14,187
- Here, more.
- Uh, yeah.

561
01:06:14,758 --> 01:06:18,608
Here, we've got a whole row. What country is this?

562
01:06:18,643 --> 01:06:21,914
- What country is this?
- What? Yair.

563
01:06:22,776 --> 01:06:26,618
- What did I say?
- Germany. - No.

564
01:06:27,194 --> 01:06:30,671
Children. get out of here.

565
01:06:30,706 --> 01:06:32,436
What do you want me to do?

566
01:06:32,471 --> 01:06:35,004
Why are they again...

567
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:36,003
Where?

568
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:38,380
Where's Glick?

569
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:25,117
Doba, it's gonna be okay.

570
01:07:25,152 --> 01:07:29,105
It's going to be all right, Doba. Don't worry.

571
01:07:54,146 --> 01:07:57,486
Mr. Gonen, perhaps you can help me?

572
01:07:57,521 --> 01:08:00,573
Step aside, Mr. Glick.
I'll help you with the questionnaire.

573
01:08:42,513 --> 01:08:45,393
- You're leaving?
- I got a leave of absence to help out.

574
01:08:45,428 --> 01:08:48,106
We're moving to Tel Aviv.

575
01:08:48,337 --> 01:08:53,174
- What are you gonna do next?
- Probably go to university.

576
01:09:00,403 --> 01:09:02,923
What of the distant island?

577
01:09:04,736 --> 01:09:06,397
Joram...

578
01:09:08,122 --> 01:09:10,935
I have to go. Goodbye.

579
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:44,703
I talked to him.

580
01:09:44,738 --> 01:09:48,178
He said the condition is much better.

581
01:09:49,163 --> 01:09:52,831
He said that maybe in a month.
you'd be coming home.

582
01:10:57,731 --> 01:11:02,965
Hana, that's enough. The tea is already stirred.
You drill the hole.

583
01:11:09,123 --> 01:11:11,072
Everyone's going to die.

584
01:11:11,331 --> 01:11:15,392
I'm gonna die, you're gonna die,

585
01:11:15,628 --> 01:11:20,588
Yoram, Glick, Kadishman, all will die.

586
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:26,144
All Jerusalem will die.

587
01:13:25,494 --> 01:13:27,777
Michael.

588
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:31,787
Say something.

589
01:13:36,902 --> 01:13:38,298
That's enough!

590
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:41,136
Stop being silent all day long!

591
01:13:42,026 --> 01:13:45,555
Stop acting like you're on a day-to-day basis,
like a clockwork alarm clock.

592
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:48,374
Hana, calm down!

593
01:13:50,997 --> 01:13:54,066
Why do you even live in the world, tell me?

594
01:13:54,688 --> 01:13:57,715
Hana, people, for the most part, don't live for ANYTHING.

595
01:13:58,137 --> 01:14:01,853
They live. Period.

596
01:16:03,776 --> 01:16:08,042
There was a tremendous power of love in me, a girl.

597
01:16:08,077 --> 01:16:13,428
Now my power of love is dying.
I don't want to die.
