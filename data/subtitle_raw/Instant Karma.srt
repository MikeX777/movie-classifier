173
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,791
What? I want to run away with you.

174
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:46,791
How much money can you bring
if we run away?

175
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,500
The 5 lakhs in my savings.

176
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,076
I'll finish it in two months.

177
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,375
After that you will have to earn
and provide for me.

178
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,875
If not, I'll run away from you too.

179
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,500
This is much better than
providing for you.

180
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,666
Find a rich girl for your needs.

181
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,725
Exactly!
That's what I'm doing right now.

182
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,625
- First time?
- Sir?

183
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,416
- Is this your first session here?
- Yeah.

184
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,166
- What's your name?
- Chitra.

185
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,166
We all have issues.

186
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,958
Depression is it's by-product.

187
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,833
Depression damages us
more than actual problems.

188
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,875
So, you may not find solutions here.

189
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:03,601
We can find ways to deal with
depression, if we discuss it.

190
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,000
Let's fight depression together!

191
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,958
LET'S FIGHT DEPRESSION TOGETHER!

192
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,541
We'll start the session
with my friend An and.

193
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:14,375
Hi

194
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:17,041
I fell in love
with a girl in college.

195
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,208
She looked breath-taking!

196
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,833
I decided I'd do anything
to make her happy.

197
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:24,875
I also went to the US for her.

198
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,833
But I got to know that her marriage
was arranged with someone else.

199
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,451
I would've been relieved if
what I had heard was a lie.

200
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,791
I returned to India immediately.

201
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,875
It's not about her getting married
to someone else.

202
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:44,541
I'm not able to digest the fact
that she is happy without me.

203
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:48,083
I could have tolerated it
if she despised me.

204
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,958
I realised she never loved me.
I couldn't stand that.

205
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,750
So, any progress?

206
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,267
Since I've been here, I've heard
a lot of issues...

207
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,250
Some bigger, some smaller than mine.

208
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,906
Most importantly, I understood that
I'm not alone in this.

209
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Chitra?

210
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:07,958
No problem.

211
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:12,333
Relax.

212
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:13,583
And take your own time.

213
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,375
How's the session, Chitra?

214
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:32,916
Hi!

215
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,375
Hi!

216
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,083
Now, the session
will start with Chitra.

217
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,458
Chitra!

218
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,166
It's been a while since you've
joined this program.

219
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,958
There is still no improvement.

220
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,833
If you want to get rid of your pain,
please share your story with us.

221
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Can I forget it?

222
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,458
My name is Chitra

223
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:10,666
I don't even know
who gave me that name.

224
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,333
I'm an orphan.

225
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:21,416
I've been unable to share my sorrows
since an early age.

226
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,458
I grew up in Mother Teresa's home
in Vizag.

227
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,875
I did my schooling there.

228
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:35,041
After my education,
I came to Hyderabad for a job.

229
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:40,250
There, I met Ajay.

230
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,291
I was alone until then.

231
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,333
But after I met Ajay...

232
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,041
I was so happy.

233
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,916
He fulfilled all my needs.

234
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,291
Happiness!

235
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,666
Family!

238
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:27,583
Where is Ajay?

239
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:31,000
We planned to come early
and go to the movies together.

240
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:34,375
But Ajay is stuck at work,
He told me to go home and get ready.

241
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,541
Oh, I see.

242
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,833
You just came back home.
Don't worry, I'll do it.

243
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,916
It's okay aunty, I'll do it.

244
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:08,208
- I'll do it, get ready to go.
- Okay

[Mobile ringing]

246
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,083
Yeah, Ajay.

247
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:23,083
I'm not Ajay, I'm a Sub-Inspector
at Gachibowli Police Station.

248
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:25,498
There's been an accident.
A man has been found dead.

249
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:28,500
We checked the belongings
found at the spot.

250
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,333
The victim seems to be Ajay,
your husband.

251
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,916
Chitra?

252
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,416
Uncle...

253
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:28,958
You'll keep thinking of him if you
stay at home all the time.

254
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:32,125
Start working to get a busy life
for some time...

255
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,833
To forget Ajay.

256
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:04,291
Ajay died in a car accident
within 6 months of our marriage...

257
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,041
My life turned into a nightmare.

258
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,500
I've lost all hope ever since.

259
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,583
We are sorry for your loss, Chitra.

260
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,958
Hope she takes this route.

261
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:36,833
I'll hitch a ride, get into her car.
And then weasel into her life.

262
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,541
Sorry, I didn't realise it was you.

263
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:56,208
- You can go ahead.
- It's okay. Get in.

264
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,583
- I don't want to trouble you.
- Not a problem, please come.

265
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,958
Thank you.

266
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,791
Actually, I'm sorry for your loss.

267
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:22,958
It's okay.

[Mobile Ringing]

269
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:29,666
Hello?

270
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,583
Hello madam, we're calling
from Jeevan Bheema insurance.

271
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,475
This call is in regard with your
husband's insurance policy claim.

272
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,833
Can you please talk to
my father-in-law about this?

273
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,166
You can find his number
in the documents.

274
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,416
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

275
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:47,166
Please stop there on the left,
I'll get down.

276

- There?
- Yeah, there.

00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,166
- Yea.
- It's okay.

278
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,333
Thank you.

279
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,000
What have you been up to?

280
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:04,898
You've been loitering
around of late.

281
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,101
You seem very busy all the time.

282
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,541
Did you bump into someone else?

283
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:10,958
Are you jealous?

284
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:15,833
Yeah, I met a girl called Chitra.
She attends the depression classes.

285
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,541
Sadly, her husband died just
6 months into their marriage.

286
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,500
I tried to trap her for my expenses.

287
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,708
Yesterday when I was in her car...

288
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:25,642
I overheard her husband's insurance
details, the pay-out could be a lot.

289
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:28,958
So, if I entrap her,
we can enjoy with her money.

290
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,083
What do you think?

291
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,666
Sounds like a solid plan,
but will she fall for you?

292
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:38,958
Not everyone is as easy as you.
But I will not give up that easily.

293
00:23:43,416 --> 00:23:46,083
Everybody looks financially
weak there.

294
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:47,583
Except for her!

295
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:50,541
She looks like a rich girl.

296
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,291
That's why I chose her.

297
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,541
I have to attend that morose
group session again.

298
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:02,208
I'll have to go early
and focus on her.

299
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,477
Good morning, all of you.

300
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:10,456
This session has been cancelled
since Madhusudhan sir is sick today.

301
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,041
He will meet all of you
in the next session.

302
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,375
I'm sorry.

303
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:25,434
Hey, it's you!

304
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:26,458
Are you okay?

305
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:27,625
Fine!

00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,892
- Get in the car.
- It's okay, you can go on.

307
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:31,083
It's okay, get in.

308
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,083
Care to join me for a coffee,
if you don't mind?

309
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:51,825
- Two cappuccinos.
- Okay, sir.

310
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:53,625
- Is that okay with you?
- Yeah.

311
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:59,333
I don't know how to open up
about this.

312
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,958
My ex-girlfriend is the reason
for my current state of mind.

313
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:06,666
Ah.

314
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:08,500
It's her birthday today.

315
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:12,416
No matter what I do, I've been
unable to forget about her.

316
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:17,125
It seems like I can't move on.

317
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:21,541
How is she happily married
to someone else?

318
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:26,333
Is it that easy to feign love?

319
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,750
Is it that easy to hurt someone?

320
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,625
Is it that easy to forget someone?!

321
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:35,041
Huh?

322
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,250
No.

323
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:45,833
I'm reminded of her everyday
in the quest of forgetting her.

324
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,333
Her betrayal is painful.

325
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:52,250
Most importantly, I'm unable to
erase her from my memory.

326
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,916
I feel conflicted, internally.

327
00:25:57,041 --> 00:25:58,458
Does everyone feel this way?

328
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,750

Hey!

330
00:26:04,508 --> 00:26:06,958
It's okay!
Don't worry.

331
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:12,083
Why are you upset when
she is the one at fault?

332
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:14,958
I am baffled because of this.

333
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:20,833
She is happy with someone else but I
constantly pine for her.

334
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,179
This is what I've been trying
to tell you.

335
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:25,958
You know she is happy with
someone else...

336
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:28,291
Yet her memories taunt you.

337
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:30,698
You have to end this, you know!

338
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,833
It isn't easy to forget someone.

339
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:39,916
You will regret crying over her
to this extent.

340
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:43,708
It's not worth it!

341
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:50,583
Okay, it's getting late.
I have to leave.

342
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:53,083
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Thanks for coming.

343
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:01,083
To hell with my life!

344
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:05,916
Keeping this act up is brutal.
I wonder how long it will take?

345
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,458
Get the receipt.

346
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:15,166
She only started talking to me
after I started crying like a baby.

347
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:17,666
Finally, you are on track with her.

348
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,833
Do you even know how hard it is to
ensnare a woman like that?

349
00:27:22,125 --> 00:27:25,125
No one is better at entrapment
than you.

350
00:27:26,375 --> 00:27:28,375
That knowledge helps me
put up with all this drama.

351
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:31,875
If I were a fool that dies for love,
I'd be dead many times over.

352
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:33,833
What's the plan?

353
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:37,041
The seed is sown. Now we wait.

Hello! That's my phone.
My name is An and.

355
00:27:57,708 --> 00:28:00,625
- I'm Chitra.
- Chitra from the depression group?

356
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:02,708
- I'm An and. We had coffee yesterday.
- Yeah.

00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,958
Actually, that's my phone.
I dropped it somewhere.

358
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:05,942
I've been looking
for it all morning.

359
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:06,750
Finally, you answered my call.

360
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,250
Yeah, I just found it
under my car seat.

361
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:15,583
Oh shit, It fell in your car?
It did not occur to me.

362
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:19,101
Tell me where you are, I'll come
there and collect my phone.

363
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:24,083
You know Xenex
at Madhapur 100 feet road?

Hey bro, how are you?

I was fine until you called me.
I don't know what will happen now!!

368
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:41,541
You should be
in the Intelligence Department!

369
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:44,208
I should stay as far as possible
from you.

370
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,875
Good joke.

371
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,250
But, I have a task for you.

372
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:50,750
- I need something for motions.
- To stop or to start?

373
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,500
Of course, to start.

374
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:55,333
- I'm talking with a customer.
- Oh!

375
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:57,101
To stop them of course.
Give me one full sheet.

376
00:28:57,125 --> 00:29:01,166
If you take a full sheet,
something down there won't work.

377
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,392
I'll give you two tablets. Take one
in the morning and evening, each.

378
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:04,432
She's already depressed.

379
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:06,041
She'll die if I give
her two tablets.

380
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:09,208
I'm talking with the customer.

381
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,750
Now tell me,
what if I won't do it?

382
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,059
Are you still talking
with the customer?

383
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:18,166
I'm talking to you this time.
What if I won't do it?

384
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:19,693
You still want to discuss options?

00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,750
You know about me, right?

386
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:22,875
I don't know pleading,
all I know is blackmailing.

If you don't comply...

388
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:25,250
I'll call your wife.

00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:27,791
My wife? What will you tell her?

390
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:32,666
I think revealing your Facebook and
Gmail passwords would be enough.

391
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,833
If you try to cleverly
change those passwords...

It's not a big deal for me
to figure them out again.

that person is someone she knows.

Or it was because you are busy
and might not be free.

694
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,000
So, I didn't message.

695
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:14,833
Oh god! I got confused.

696
00:51:16,208 --> 00:51:16,416
Huh?

697
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:19,750
I mean, I thought you would be busy.

698
00:51:54,166 --> 00:51:55,541
Why did Chitra kill Ajay?

699
00:52:11,125 --> 00:52:13,500
What is her plan?

700
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:14,958
What is she doing?

701
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:24,625
I'm not even educated enough
to understand these documents.

702
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:40,625
My husband is out of town.

703
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:43,000
As if, he'd do something if he's
in town.

704
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:47,291
Okay, I also need a small commercial
break, from this tension.

705
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:51,708
We'll arrange cash.

706
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:53,958
You need 3 photographs?

707
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:55,375
Okay!

708
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:56,166
Hi An and.

709
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:57,666
Hi, hi uncle.

710
00:52:57,833 --> 00:52:59,416
Yeah, okay. I'll talk to you later.

711
00:53:03,291 --> 00:53:04,291
How are you?

712
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,500
I'm fine uncle.

713
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:05,750
Its good.

714
00:53:06,333 --> 00:53:07,875
Look, An and is also here.

715
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:09,500
Yeah, he just arrived.

716
00:53:09,625 --> 00:53:10,625
- Yeah, okay.
- Hi, aunty.

717
00:53:11,041 --> 00:53:12,041
Okay.

718
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:13,750
Chitra.

719
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,333
Oh!

720
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:15,625
She's here too.

721
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:17,333
She is downstairs.

722
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,583
I am dead for sure.

723
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,916
Apparently she didn't know
that you were coming?

724
00:53:21,041 --> 00:53:22,250
No aunty, she didn't know.

725
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:23,416
Okay.

726
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:25,351
Would you like to have tea or
coffee?

727
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,375
No, aunty.

728
00:53:26,958 --> 00:53:28,441
I'll have a glass
of water, that's it.

729
00:53:28,475 --> 00:53:29,475
Okay!

730
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,476
Both of you are here today without
each other's knowledge. Why?

731
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,500
What's the matter?

732
00:53:34,666 --> 00:53:35,666
My karma, uncle.

733
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:38,000
We just spoke about you yesterday.

734
00:53:38,083 --> 00:53:39,625
So, I felt like seeing you.

735
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:41,750
That's why I came to meet you.

736
00:53:41,958 --> 00:53:44,416
Coincidentally, Chitra is also here.

737
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:47,583
The devil has arrived.

738
00:53:49,250 --> 00:53:50,250
What is this suddenly?

739
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:57,458
- It's been a while since I visited.
- Oh

740
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:03,958
Aunty, some of my packages...

741
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:06,291
Are still getting delivered
to this address.

742
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,125
I came to collect them.

743
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:10,541
I changed the address just now.

744
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:13,708
They'll come to the right address
from now on.

745
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:16,146
'Wow, she is putting up
a great show!'

746
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:17,708
Should we leave?

747
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:19,166
Yeah!

748
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:20,995
- See you later uncle.
- Bye!

749
00:54:27,791 --> 00:54:29,750
I have a little work,
I'll be back in 2 hours.

750
00:54:29,958 --> 00:54:31,833
Okay, it's alright.

751
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:33,892
- Should I get something for you?
- Nope. I don't need anything.

752
00:54:33,916 --> 00:54:34,958
Okay.

753
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:41,208
Why is she going out on a Sunday?

754
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:27,541
- Hi Sam.
- Hi.

755
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:29,416
- How are you?
- Fine. Fine.

756
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:36,642
Check all the files if you want,
properly.

757
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,291
If you have any doubt,
please call me.

758
00:55:38,416 --> 00:55:41,541
I strictly want it to be very
confidential. Just between you & me.

759
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:43,541
And I don't want anybody
to come in between...

760
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,125
Gosh! The devil has returned.

761
00:56:12,291 --> 00:56:14,166
Did she see me there?

762
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:23,989
I wanted to cover your eyes
and make you guess who it was.

763
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:25,721
Like what I was dealing with wasn't
enough.

764
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,333
What are you doing?

765
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:29,916
I don't know either.

766
00:56:31,666 --> 00:56:32,666
Read this.

767
00:56:38,083 --> 00:56:38,833
What is this?

768
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:40,458
Insurance papers.

769
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:41,583
Insurance papers?

770
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:43,041
Read it properly and sign it.

771
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:45,416
We are calling from Jeevan
Bheema Insurance...

772
00:56:45,708 --> 00:56:47,875
We have to talk about your
husband's insurance amount.

773
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,166
Insurance on my name?

774
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:51,541
That means, I'm also...

775
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:53,166
Huh, goddammit.

776
00:56:53,791 --> 00:56:55,851
I planned to get away with
her dead ex-husband's insurance.

777
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:57,583
Now I am stuck in this trap too.

778
00:56:57,958 --> 00:56:59,333
Should I sign now?

779
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,416
Of course.

780
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,916
She'll kill me either way.

781
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:07,583
Next page.

782
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:26,500
I'll going to have water.

783
00:57:27,291 --> 00:57:28,291
Would you like some too?

784
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,500
No.

785
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Who are you?

786
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:42,625
She's going to stay here from today.

787
00:57:42,958 --> 00:57:45,000
You'll take her to the
office every day?

788
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:45,666
No.

789
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:47,650
To take care of the household work!

790
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,916
I've been taking care
of all that work.

791
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:51,375
Exactly.

792
00:57:51,416 --> 00:57:52,809
That's the reason behind hiring her.

793
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:54,433
Why should you be bothered
with all that?

794
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:57,916
Look at all the love
you have for me. Bitch!

795
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:00,625
Nice to meet you,
What's your name?

796
00:58:00,958 --> 00:58:01,958
Dhanamma.

797
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:03,625
My name is An and.

798
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:05,541
You can start from tomorrow.

799
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:08,250
No, she's going to be staying here.

800
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,666
Is she staying nights too?

801
00:58:12,375 --> 00:58:14,541
Living here 24/7.

802
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:17,125
Apparently living here 24/7.

803
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:19,750
Okay, okay, nice, nice.
Cool.

804
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:20,958
Go ahead then!

805
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:22,958
Why did she hire her?

806
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:29,125
I thought I could escape but she
took a policy on my name.

807
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:32,206
I should live here
while I figure a way out of this.

808
00:58:33,375 --> 00:58:36,041
If I step out, she might
get me killed in an accident too.

809
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:38,408
I should only step outside
if it's absolutely necessary.

810
00:58:57,958 --> 00:58:58,958
Did she stab me?

811
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,750
Oh, it was her leg!

812
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:07,541
Get it off me, you imbecile.

813
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:30,625
'A newly married wife...'

814
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,101
'...within 2 months of marriage, '

815
00:59:32,125 --> 00:59:36,125
'Planned to kill her husband,
for insurance money.'

816
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,666
Why sort of content is this?

817
00:59:39,708 --> 00:59:41,333
'You'll be shocked
to know the reason.'

818
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:42,615
Bad timing in my life, I guess!

819
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:02,250
Hey.
Relax, relax, it's me.

820
01:00:02,416 --> 01:00:03,434
It's just me.
What happened to you?

821
01:00:03,458 --> 01:00:05,138
Nothing, nothing,
I was having a nightmare.

822
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:06,750
Let me get you some water.

823
01:00:07,583 --> 01:00:09,666
I must have fallen
asleep here last night.

824
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:26,583
Why did you sleep here?

825
01:00:26,875 --> 01:00:28,309
You might kill me
if I sleep next to you.

826
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,333
I'm asking you!

827
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:31,791
I felt cold in the night.

828
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,250
I thought you'd be disturbed
if I turned off the AC.

829
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:35,950
So, I came out and slept here.

830
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:39,708
You've been very thoughtful.

831
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:44,500
Okay, I'll get ready to go to work.

832
01:00:52,041 --> 01:00:53,750
Whoa! Is she trying to kill me?

833
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,650
Which curry would you like to have?

834
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:56,916
Your wish.

835
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:58,791
I was asked to make
whatever you prefer.

836
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:01,291
Brinjal.

837
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:02,541
What kind?

838
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:06,125
Make stuffed brinjal.

839
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:08,000
Okay, I'll make that.

840
01:01:08,833 --> 01:01:11,393
Oh god, is she a sorceress or did
someone perform sorcery on her?

841
01:01:12,458 --> 01:01:15,125
The way she looks,
the way she walks.

842
01:01:15,791 --> 01:01:17,000
Scary!

843
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,250
She deliberately hired this maid.

844
01:01:20,875 --> 01:01:22,500
When she saw me at her
in-law's house

845
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:24,151
She must have suspected something.

846
01:01:24,416 --> 01:01:26,208
That's why she placed the maid here.

847
01:01:26,791 --> 01:01:27,791
Something is fishy.

848
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:30,250
Her first victim was
a software engineer.

849
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:31,695
At least she plotted against him.

850
01:01:31,791 --> 01:01:33,631
There's no need to plot
against a fool like me.

851
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:35,625
She could kill me pretty easily.

852
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:38,625
I should find a way to escape.

853
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,958
That witch must have slept by now.

854
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:43,291
This is the right time.

855
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:52,541
[Doorbell ringing]

856
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:55,375
Hi!

857
01:01:57,583 --> 01:01:58,934
She is not at home.

858
01:01:58,958 --> 01:02:01,416
I didn't come for her.

859
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:02,916
She's not at home.

860
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,083
Only the maid can help you.

861
01:02:05,208 --> 01:02:06,041
The maid...

862
01:02:06,083 --> 01:02:08,208
Dhanamma! Aunty needs something.

863
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:14,250
What do you want?

864
01:02:14,458 --> 01:02:15,498
Do you have chilly powder?

865
01:02:15,541 --> 01:02:16,625
Yes.

866
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:22,976
Here you go.

867
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Thanks.

868
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:25,708
Hmmm.

869
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:36,875
Did she really fall asleep
or is she acting?

870
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:39,059
Or even worse is she
plotting her next move?

871
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:40,208
I have no idea.

872
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:44,000
Dear God! Please watch
over me tonight.

873
01:02:44,583 --> 01:02:45,583
Please.

874
01:02:56,875 --> 01:02:58,195
Looks like she's really sleeping.

875
01:02:58,291 --> 01:02:59,541
I should also crash.

876
01:03:04,208 --> 01:03:05,708
My life has turned into a joke.

877
01:03:06,208 --> 01:03:08,559
Instead of being turned on because
there's an aunty next to me...

878
01:03:08,583 --> 01:03:10,750
I'm scared for my life!
How pathetic am I?

879
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:14,500
Shit, I never even dreamt of
a situation like this in my life!

880
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:17,583
Why are you telling me all this?

881
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:18,754
Because, even if I tell you, you

882
01:03:18,788 --> 01:03:20,068
can't communicate
it with anyone!

883
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,041
As long as this witch is here

884
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:24,820
It'll keep getting harder for me.

885
01:03:25,083 --> 01:03:27,083
I should do something and
get out of this place.

886
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:33,791
[Mobile ringing]

887
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,083
Tell me

888
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:35,958
I need a knock-out drug
that can be mixed with milk.

889
01:03:36,041 --> 01:03:37,041
Condoms, please!

890
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:38,791
You need condoms?

891
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:40,958
Not condoms, any knock-out drug.

892
01:03:41,375 --> 01:03:43,041
I'm talking to the customer,
not you!

893
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,250
- Condoms?
- Yes.

894
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:46,583
You want it every day?

895
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:48,083
How?

896
01:03:48,416 --> 01:03:49,416
How?

897
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:51,125
Please attend to me first!

898
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:52,666
What's your budget?

899
01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:55,000
You are asking me for money?
Send something nice.

900
01:03:55,291 --> 01:03:56,666
I think you should listen to me...

901
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I'm not going to
entertain your questions.

902
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:01,051
Got it! Where do I send it?
How do I send it?

903
01:04:53,916 --> 01:04:57,166
I need to tell you something

904
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:02,291
Actually, I married you...

905
01:05:03,125 --> 01:05:04,666
...for your money.

906
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,625
Everything that I told
you until now, is a lie.

907
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:10,833
Yeah, I know.

908
01:05:13,041 --> 01:05:17,791
I joined the depression group,
to trap you.

909
01:05:22,833 --> 01:05:23,833
I know.

910
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:25,583
She knew this too?

911
01:05:25,791 --> 01:05:28,750
I thought you could be of help.

912
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,583
I acted accordingly.

913
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:33,708
Oh, my freaking God!

914
01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:34,851
That's the extent she can go to!

915
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:37,291
My cheap plans and I
never stood a chance against her.

916
01:05:38,041 --> 01:05:42,583
I don't feel like all that has
happened is fair.

917
01:05:42,833 --> 01:05:45,708
That's why I'm planning
to leave the house.

918
01:05:49,708 --> 01:05:51,625
You've fallen into this trap now.

919
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:54,250
You can't go back
on your own whim.

920
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:57,291
From now on, whatever we do...

921
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:58,708
We should do it together.

922
01:05:59,583 --> 01:06:00,625
Okay?

923
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:03,831
Together?
What do you mean?

924
01:06:04,291 --> 01:06:07,458
I knew you were a fraudster,
the very moment I met you.

925
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:10,375
All the plans you
hatched to ensnare me.

926
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:11,833
I know all about that.

927
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:16,583
And the thing which I know and
you don't, do you know what it is?

928
01:06:18,625 --> 01:06:23,500
I know that you know
everything about me.

929
01:06:24,166 --> 01:06:26,916
Only if we plan together...

930
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:29,708
We can figure out
a way out of this.

931
01:06:30,458 --> 01:06:30,916
Okay?

932
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:32,750
Did she get caught too?

933
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:36,833
What actually happened

934
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:47,250
I've faced a lot of
hardships since childhood.

935
01:06:47,458 --> 01:06:50,416
I thought this office
would end my troubles.

936
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:53,500
I met Ajay there.

937
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,541
Ajay?

938
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:24,666
What are you doing here?

939
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,833
I was just finishing up with work.

940
01:07:27,458 --> 01:07:30,250
I caught Ajay making
a huge mistake.

941
01:07:31,708 --> 01:07:33,541
Just a moment.

942
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:39,184
Something isn't right
about your story.

943
01:07:39,208 --> 01:07:40,208
Please tell me the truth.

944
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:43,500
Good.

945
01:07:44,125 --> 01:07:45,125
You caught me!

946
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:48,290
It was just a small doubt.

947
01:07:48,416 --> 01:07:49,416
That's why!

948
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:56,708
In fact,
it wasn't Ajay who got caught

949
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
It was me.

950
01:09:06,916 --> 01:09:08,625
I cannot accept your apology.

951
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,666
If you can't do it, tell me!
I will find someone else.

952
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:16,198
- Give me two day's time, sir.
- What two days? TWO DAYS?

953
01:09:21,125 --> 01:09:23,351
Sir, by tomorrow we'll finish it.

954
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:24,855
- What tomorrow?
- You there! Show me!

955
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:32,583
Rubbish, this will
take only two days?

956
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:35,000
All of you are a bunch of fools!

957
01:09:36,791 --> 01:09:39,166
You! Come to my cabin!

958
01:09:41,208 --> 01:09:42,248
What are you doing Chitra?

959
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,250
Shit!

960
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:53,458
Please, don't tell this to anyone.

961
01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:56,916
I'll give you how much ever
you'd like.

962
01:09:57,583 --> 01:09:59,303
What's all this?
What exactly are you doing?

963
01:10:01,333 --> 01:10:05,583
I've been copying
our project proposal details.

964
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:08,458
If we leak our proposal...

965
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:12,125
They will make a better proposal
and submit them to the client.

966
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,708
They are paying me for that.

967
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,101
But our company will face a loss.

968
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:18,125
So? Why should I care?

969
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,500
If we do this right,
we'll get 40 lakhs.

970
01:10:22,541 --> 01:10:24,061
You've made me your
accomplice already?

971
01:10:26,041 --> 01:10:27,041
That's not what I meant!

972
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:30,151
How much do you want?
Just tell me!

973
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:39,500
15 lakhs!
Is that enough?

974
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:46,018
Okay!

975
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:50,125
We started forging
office files together.

976
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:57,041
Is it okay?
It's safe right?

977
01:10:57,166 --> 01:10:58,166
Completely untraceable.

978
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:01,226
Not just cybercrime,
even CIA can't catch this.

979
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,250
Trust me!

980
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:36,416
If need be...

981
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:39,000
We'd delete the agreements
from the server as well.

982
01:11:40,958 --> 01:11:41,958
After that

983
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:46,333
I started making more
than I could ever dream of!

984
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:50,666
Ajay earned a lot too.

985
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:55,333
We created an offshore account
with the help of a C.A.

986
01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:57,625
We made sure all the money
went into that account.

987
01:11:58,125 --> 01:12:00,791
Later, we would
transfer it to our accounts.

988
01:12:07,333 --> 01:12:13,083
We started selling off
other teams' information too.

989
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:19,375
We planned it precisely.
No one suspected a thing.

990
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:24,166
I'd signal Ajay at the right time.

991
01:12:26,566 --> 01:12:28,066
Guys, let's go for a smoke?

992
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,416
Ajay would keep them distracted
until I signal led him again.

993
01:13:38,416 --> 01:13:39,583
My life is much better now.

994
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:41,333
I used to be broke.

995
01:13:41,416 --> 01:13:43,000
My salary was never enough.

996
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:45,270
Now I feel like I have
all that I need.

997
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:47,500
Should we get married?

998
01:13:51,166 --> 01:13:52,166
I mean it, Chitra!

999
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:00,708
Okay!

1000
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:15,041
You agreed instantly?

1001
01:14:16,708 --> 01:14:19,416
I was sharing
all the money until then.

1002
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:22,153
I thought if we were to get married,
I would get all of it.

1003
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:23,625
I could keep everything.

1004
01:14:25,208 --> 01:14:28,916
I thought if I saved up 10 crores,
I can run away to some place.

1005
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:35,041
If I didn't accept his proposal,
he could have threatened me.

1006
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:41,708
So, in the name of marriage,
I secured some time.

1007
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,940
That's a valid reason
to get married.

1008
01:14:45,416 --> 01:14:46,416
What happened next?

1009
01:14:48,666 --> 01:14:49,291
Sir!

1010
01:14:49,625 --> 01:14:50,333
Good morning sir!

1011
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:51,415
What the hell is going on?

1012
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:53,726
The application that
we planned to release...

1013
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:56,070
was released by another company,
10 days before our launch?

1014
01:14:56,208 --> 01:14:57,708
For God's sake, it's a big hit!

1015
01:14:58,125 --> 01:14:59,125
Uhh.. Sir, that...

1016
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:04,000
I don't know how and who did it!

1017
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:06,000
How could you not know?

1018
01:15:06,125 --> 01:15:07,725
Someone from our side
leaked the project.

1019
01:15:08,125 --> 01:15:09,833
- No, sir.
- I want them immediately.

1020
01:15:09,916 --> 01:15:10,916
Sir, actually...

1021
01:15:19,291 --> 01:15:20,291
How is it...

1022
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:22,416
Our boss...

1023
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:30,736
Do... do... do...

1024
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,000
Do you know
what is happening in the office?

1025
01:15:34,916 --> 01:15:36,833
The application which we were
executing...

1026
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:40,250
Someone else released it
with the same features.

1027
01:15:40,416 --> 01:15:41,416
How is it...

1028
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:43,625
- Ah...
- What actually happened?

1029
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:44,750
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

1030
01:15:48,083 --> 01:15:49,833
The case has been filed.

1031
01:15:50,666 --> 01:15:53,250
The criminals will be caught soon!

1032
01:15:57,916 --> 01:15:59,458
You all may go. Please, get out!

1033
01:16:00,458 --> 01:16:01,458
GET OUT!

1034
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:20,250
Hey!

1035
01:16:20,416 --> 01:16:21,416
How is the new car?

1036
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:23,833
What is this?

1037
01:16:24,166 --> 01:16:25,166
I got it for us, Chitra.

1038
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,541
Good, my son. Nice car!

1039
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:31,226
Did you take a loan?

1040
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:32,250
No, Dad!

1041
01:16:32,666 --> 01:16:35,166
A client gifted it for
my work on a project.

1042
01:16:35,875 --> 01:16:39,166
Oh! Nice.

1043
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:43,083
Do we really need this now?

1044
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:46,625
We can't raise suspicion
at this point.

1045
01:16:46,958 --> 01:16:49,375
If they suspect us,
our life will come crashing down.

1046
01:16:51,541 --> 01:16:52,541
Who will suspect us now?

1047
01:16:52,916 --> 01:16:54,236
Your dad was suspicious just now.

1048
01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:55,833
Won't others follow suit?

1049
01:16:56,083 --> 01:16:58,041
It's okay, I'll take care of it.

1050
01:16:58,500 --> 01:16:59,916
Don't ruin my mood like a fool.

1051
01:17:01,375 --> 01:17:03,416
I can't be as mechanical as you.

1052
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:06,083
- Just do whatever you want.
- Chitra!

1053
01:17:12,583 --> 01:17:15,541
Ajay, started losing it.

1054
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:56,083
All in!

1055
01:17:59,833 --> 01:18:00,833
I call!

1056
01:18:02,041 --> 01:18:03,041
Fuck!

1057
01:18:10,541 --> 01:18:14,083
[Mobile ringing]

1058
01:18:17,291 --> 01:18:18,291
Hello!

1059
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:21,833
I'm out with friends,
I'll come home later.

1060
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:23,278
Why are you always drinking Ajay?

1061
01:18:23,916 --> 01:18:25,076
When will I drink if not now?

1062
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:27,041
Hello?

1063
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:37,208
Drink guys! Won't you drink
even if the tab is on me?

1064
01:18:57,291 --> 01:18:58,291
Ajay

1065
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,580
You are drinking every day.

1066
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:03,708
Don't create a scene.
What will happen if I drink?

1067
01:19:04,291 --> 01:19:05,541
What do you mean by that?

1068
01:19:07,333 --> 01:19:08,666
You've been drinking every day.

1069
01:19:09,458 --> 01:19:11,000
And those weekly visits to clubs?

1070
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:12,416
Is it necessary?

1071
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:14,689
This is the time to have fun.

1072
01:19:14,723 --> 01:19:16,458
Should I do it after
retirement then?

1073
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:22,541
If you keep spending this way,
it's bound to raise suspicion.

1074
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:23,625
Try to understand.

1075
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,333
If you blurt this all out someday,
we will end up behind bars.

1076
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:30,791
All my hard work will go to waste.

1077
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:32,916
Why are you shouting?

1078
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:34,500
I'm a part of this too!

1079
01:19:35,125 --> 01:19:36,125
Don't over-react.

1080
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:37,833
You keep all your money.

1081
01:19:38,375 --> 01:19:39,735
I'll do whatever I want with mine.

1082
01:20:04,791 --> 01:20:08,666
We never thought we'd get caught.

1083
01:20:13,416 --> 01:20:15,541
Ajay, as I told you...

1084
01:20:15,791 --> 01:20:16,791
I can make sure

1085
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,250
you never land another job.

1086
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:22,583
- Sir.
- Stop!

1087
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:30,708
What do I have to gain from
doing something like that?

1088
01:20:31,041 --> 01:20:31,625
Now...

1089
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:34,291
Everyone does things,
for their own benefit.

1090
01:20:35,875 --> 01:20:38,416
Even I'm a human being,
just like you all.

1091
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:43,125
So, according to the deal
you make with me...

1092
01:20:43,541 --> 01:20:44,541
I will react.

1093
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:48,166
Didn't you understand?

1094
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:54,083
Otherwise, the crime I caught
on tape will be sent to the police.

1095
01:20:55,708 --> 01:20:58,583
In such a horrible situation...

1096
01:21:00,041 --> 01:21:01,333
This is a great deal.

1097
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:03,118
No one will be this generous.

1098
01:21:03,541 --> 01:21:06,250
Like, God sent.

1099
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:07,625
Forty percent.

1100
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:12,833
40 for you, 60 for me.

1101
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:19,208
Everyone is
a self-centred bastard.

1102
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:21,666
I thought it was just me until now.

1103
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,833
Although, women are no less.

1104
01:21:26,166 --> 01:21:29,833
It's hard to suspect and
catch women when they cheat.

1105
01:21:32,666 --> 01:21:34,583
This is a deal of a lifetime, Ajay.

1106
01:21:35,875 --> 01:21:39,583
Our company secured a
30 crore project from Rushaba.

1107
01:21:39,875 --> 01:21:44,833
If we sell that project to
Seoul's Okama company.

1108
01:21:45,458 --> 01:21:47,875
They'll give 20 crores instantly.

1109
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:49,750
Super deal!

1110
01:21:50,208 --> 01:21:52,541
This time the share will be
70 for me, 30 for you.

1111
01:21:55,166 --> 01:21:56,750
Okay, I'll do it.

1112
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:00,996
But only I'll deal with it.

1113
01:22:03,833 --> 01:22:04,833
Don't let Chitra know.

1114
01:22:04,958 --> 01:22:05,958
Oh!

1115
01:22:09,541 --> 01:22:10,541
Okay!

1116
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:13,791
Thank you, sir.

1117
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:14,958
Do it right.

1118
01:22:24,166 --> 01:22:24,791
Where's Ajay?

1119
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,125
He didn't come, sir, he's on leave.

1120
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:28,958
Leave?

1121
01:22:29,208 --> 01:22:30,208
Sir!

1122
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:31,850
Recently, Ajay has landed
a lot of money.

1123
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:33,818
He seems to be
enjoying a lot, sir.

1124
01:22:34,125 --> 01:22:35,666
I suspect he's up to something, sir.

1125
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:39,559
I'll take care of it,
you can go.

1126
01:22:39,583 --> 01:22:40,583
Okay, sir.

1127
01:22:53,041 --> 01:22:55,250
We've been offered a huge deal.

1128
01:22:56,541 --> 01:22:59,958
It's valued at 30 crores.

1129
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:04,500
If we give it to the other company,
they'll give us 20 crores.

1130
01:23:05,166 --> 01:23:07,291
I've already finalised it.

1131
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:12,458
I spoke with Ajay too.

1132
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:18,166
He wants to do it without you.

1133
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:23,000
I know that he is incompetent.

1134
01:23:26,541 --> 01:23:29,791
I want you to do this.

1135
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:31,208
Yeah, I will do it.

1136
01:23:33,333 --> 01:23:34,333
Done!

1137
01:23:35,333 --> 01:23:37,208
This is a one-year project.

1138
01:23:37,958 --> 01:23:41,041
I never thought Ajay
was capable of hiding such a thing.

1139
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:46,208
Why did our boss
offer it to Ajay first?

1140
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:50,291
I had no control over the situation.

1141
01:23:52,625 --> 01:23:55,791
They transferred the money
to the offshore account.

1142
01:23:57,541 --> 01:23:58,916
Give it to me in cash.

1143
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:05,916
After the project is done,
I'll delete all your videos.

1144
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:06,833
After that...

1145
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,500
You will be a free bird!

1146
01:24:11,208 --> 01:24:15,166
I couldn't trust anyone.
I was trapped.

1147
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,875
I couldn't let this go out of hand.

1148
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:24,041
Our company made a blueprint.

1149
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:28,583
We copied it secretly and
sent it to the Korean company.

1150
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:31,583
One crore was deposited
in our offshore account.

1151
01:24:34,041 --> 01:24:35,041
Hello!

1152
01:24:35,166 --> 01:24:36,686
Was the money deposited
in the account?

1153
01:24:39,291 --> 01:24:41,166
Just 5 minutes ago, sir!

1154
01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:44,291
Why didn't you tell me?

1155
01:24:45,416 --> 01:24:47,583
You called me before.

1156
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:51,750
Okay

1157
01:24:52,625 --> 01:24:55,583
Encash it immediately
and send 60% to me.

1158
01:24:56,166 --> 01:24:57,625
Yeah. Okay!

1159
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:27,416
Ajay needed money.

1160
01:25:28,125 --> 01:25:29,125
He checked his account.

1161
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:32,291
The 1 crore promised by the manager,
was not credited to his account.

1162
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:37,416
Our manager didn't call him.
He opened my mail to check.

1163
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:40,708
I didn't know that
he knew my password.

1164
01:25:41,375 --> 01:25:44,291
He found the message from the bank.

1165
01:25:44,541 --> 01:25:45,083
That was it.

1166
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:50,375
He knew that
I took up the job secretly.

1167
01:25:57,208 --> 01:25:58,208
One large, please.

1168
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:39,833
What's up, Ajay?

1169
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
You are a scamster!

1170
01:26:41,625 --> 01:26:43,585
You kept me in the dark
and got her to do the job.

1171
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:45,351
What are you talking about, Ajay?

1172
01:26:45,375 --> 01:26:47,875
You are a fool to trust her.

1173
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:51,333
You would have gotten your fair
share if I did the job.

1174
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,625
Now, she will take it all!

1175
01:26:55,583 --> 01:26:58,750
I won't let you get away
with what you did to me.

1176
01:26:59,916 --> 01:27:00,916
I will see to your end.

1177
01:27:01,208 --> 01:27:02,666
Ajay was very aggressive.

1178
01:27:02,833 --> 01:27:06,791
My manager feared that we would
get caught due to this.

1179
01:27:14,708 --> 01:27:17,791
Will you join hands with anyone?

1180
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:20,208
It was with me first,
it's him now?

1181
01:27:21,125 --> 01:27:24,083
What are you talking about?

1182
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:26,614
I know that you are dealing
with that manager by yourself.

1183
01:27:30,666 --> 01:27:32,026
You thought of it first. Remember?

1184
01:27:32,791 --> 01:27:34,708
Yes, I thought of it,
but I didn't do it.

1185
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:35,791
YOU DID IT!

1186
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:37,245
There's a lot of difference.

1187
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:39,250
Ajay, Relax!

1188
01:27:39,625 --> 01:27:41,583
After this project,
I'll give you a share too.

1189
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:42,625
What's the big deal?

1190
01:27:43,791 --> 01:27:44,791
Who wants your share?

1191
01:27:44,958 --> 01:27:45,958
I can do it too.

1192
01:27:47,166 --> 01:27:48,606
Anyway, you are doing well with him?

1193
01:27:49,083 --> 01:27:50,226
Do whatever you want with him.

1194
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:51,250
You don't need me.

1195
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:52,750
You only care for money.

1196
01:27:52,958 --> 01:27:54,158
You don't care about emotions.

1197
01:27:54,333 --> 01:27:56,125
Hello. Hello. Hello.
Calm down!

1198
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,833
You can't talk about emotions.

1199
01:27:58,875 --> 01:28:02,267
I know what you've been doing
with all the money and alcohol.

1200
01:28:02,291 --> 01:28:03,291
What?
What do you mean?

1201
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:09,125
I mean all the money
that you spent on those women.

1202
01:28:09,416 --> 01:28:11,208
You don't have a clue.

1203
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:13,250
You bloody...

1204
01:28:13,333 --> 01:28:14,333
Are you spying on me?

1205
01:28:17,666 --> 01:28:18,666
Try to remember...

1206
01:28:19,166 --> 01:28:22,958
Two years ago,
Priya from our office...

1207
01:28:23,458 --> 01:28:25,298
I know how you used her
and destroyed her life.

1208
01:28:26,708 --> 01:28:28,583
I let it go because
it was your weakness.

1209
01:28:29,916 --> 01:28:31,833
Why did you stay with me
despite all this?

1210
01:28:32,041 --> 01:28:32,625
Why?

1211
01:28:32,916 --> 01:28:33,916
You wanted to use me.

1212
01:28:35,625 --> 01:28:39,541
I won't let you get away with this.

1213
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,725
Ajay! Ajay! Ajay! Please!

1214
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,500
Please! Wait a minute.

1215
01:28:43,708 --> 01:28:47,333
Think about your parents.

1216
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:48,976
You didn't take care of them.

1217
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,900
Now you'll destroy their future too?

1218
01:28:52,771 --> 01:28:55,187
Why are you so concerned about them?

1219
01:28:55,604 --> 01:28:57,324
Why are you trying
to bait me with emotions?

1220
01:29:00,604 --> 01:29:02,146
They got married,
and gave birth to me.

1221
01:29:02,187 --> 01:29:03,229
They had to raise me.

1222
01:29:03,937 --> 01:29:05,312
Most useless parents!

1223
01:29:07,104 --> 01:29:08,163
They didn't do anything for me.

1224
01:29:08,187 --> 01:29:09,562
I made all this by myself!

1225
01:29:10,104 --> 01:29:12,021
Taking care of them
is already a big deal.

1226
01:29:12,396 --> 01:29:13,604
Bloody losers!

1227
01:29:13,979 --> 01:29:15,896
I don't care about them anyway!

1228
01:29:17,229 --> 01:29:20,062
I'll be watching you both!

1229
01:29:21,896 --> 01:29:25,479
Ajay would refuse to understand.
That was clear.

1230
01:29:26,687 --> 01:29:27,812
This time, I had no choice.

1231
01:29:27,854 --> 01:29:31,479
Nothing seems wrong for people
already on the wrong track.

1232
01:29:38,104 --> 01:29:40,396
Ajay cannot be a part of our plan.

1233
01:29:40,479 --> 01:29:43,312
We'll get caught before the pay-out.

1234
01:29:43,854 --> 01:29:47,187
If Ajay is involved, we won't get
even 10% of the pay-out.

1235
01:29:48,979 --> 01:29:52,271
Eliminating him is justified.

1236
01:29:53,354 --> 01:29:55,771
Anyway, Ajay was
squandering all the money.

1237
01:29:55,812 --> 01:29:58,093
And there was a chance
he would expose the matter at hand.

1238
01:29:58,896 --> 01:30:01,604
If he were dead,
you could get the 40%.

1239
01:30:01,646 --> 01:30:02,846
Isn't that why you killed him?

1240
01:30:07,062 --> 01:30:08,182
That wasn't the only reason.

1241
01:30:10,187 --> 01:30:11,187
Think about it

1242
01:30:12,104 --> 01:30:13,271
This is the only option.

1243
01:30:16,187 --> 01:30:19,604
I have all your videos.

1244
01:30:21,896 --> 01:30:23,896
So? You agreed to it?

1245
01:30:24,729 --> 01:30:26,009
Did Ajay give me another option?

1246
01:30:26,104 --> 01:30:27,312
That's also true

1247
01:30:28,187 --> 01:30:30,479
This guy's name is Khalid

1248
01:30:30,604 --> 01:30:31,604
Professional killer

1249
01:30:34,229 --> 01:30:36,396
If you inform him
about Ajay's movements...

1250
01:30:37,021 --> 01:30:40,604
He'll finish him off
at the appropriate time.

1251
01:31:14,541 --> 01:31:14,583
Varma sir asked me
to speak to you.

1252
01:31:15,354 --> 01:31:17,205
This is Khalid speaking

1253
01:31:17,229 --> 01:31:20,812
Ajay will be on the Gachibowli route
tomorrow evening in a red Audi.

1254
01:31:21,312 --> 01:31:25,437
Make it look like an accident
and kill him, to avoid suspicion.

1255
01:31:26,146 --> 01:31:27,146
Okay

1256
01:31:31,229 --> 01:31:33,517
(A car met with an accident
in Gachibowli today...)

1257
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:36,458
(Police said that the person
in the car died on the spot)

1258
01:31:37,083 --> 01:31:38,101
(The deceased's name is Ajay)

1259
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:40,208
(The victim was a software employee)

1260
01:31:53,312 --> 01:31:54,604
Come.
Sit.

1261
01:31:58,687 --> 01:31:59,687
What happened, sir?

1262
01:31:59,854 --> 01:32:01,054
You wanted to see me urgently?

1263
01:32:01,604 --> 01:32:04,830
There's a small change in the plan,
Chitra.

1264
01:32:04,854 --> 01:32:05,562
What is it?

1265
01:32:05,604 --> 01:32:06,604
Percentage!

1266
01:32:07,812 --> 01:32:10,937
You are alone now right?

1267
01:32:12,562 --> 01:32:15,479
The society will be watching you.

1268
01:32:15,812 --> 01:32:18,979
So, I'll be taking Ajay's share too.

1269
01:32:20,833 --> 01:32:23,479
You can also live peacefully.

1270
01:32:23,625 --> 01:32:26,187
So, keep 10% with you.

1271
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:28,875
Transfer the rest to me.

1272
01:32:30,271 --> 01:32:31,646
What the f...?

1273
01:32:32,937 --> 01:32:34,146
One moment.

1274
01:32:35,562 --> 01:32:36,562
Tell me, sir.

1275
01:32:36,708 --> 01:32:38,333
Khalid! Did you record it?

1276
01:32:38,562 --> 01:32:39,604
I did sir!

1277
01:32:40,021 --> 01:32:41,771
Varma sir, asked me to talk to you.

1278
01:32:43,021 --> 01:32:46,896
Ajay will be on the Gachibowli route
tomorrow evening in a red Audi.

1279
01:32:47,396 --> 01:32:51,146
Make it look like an accident
and kill him to avoid suspicion.

1280
01:32:51,896 --> 01:32:55,021
Now he is blackmailing me,
with the call recording.

1281
01:32:55,646 --> 01:32:58,146
Please, take your seat.

1282
01:33:03,771 --> 01:33:06,062
This is absolutely unfair.

1283
01:33:11,104 --> 01:33:15,538
We've lost the right to use
the word unfair a long time ago.

1284
01:33:15,562 --> 01:33:17,021
Don't you think so?

1285
01:33:21,187 --> 01:33:22,867
I understand you
want to keep Ajay's share.

1286
01:33:23,104 --> 01:33:24,562
What is this 10%?

1287
01:33:27,937 --> 01:33:29,437
My Guru once told me...

1288
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:31,521
90 is my lucky number.

1289
01:33:33,271 --> 01:33:37,896
So, if I give you 10%,
everything will work in my favour.

1290
01:33:39,354 --> 01:33:40,354
So...

1291
01:33:41,354 --> 01:33:44,687
Don't drag this matter out.

1292
01:33:47,979 --> 01:33:49,396
You are a smart girl.

1293
01:33:55,187 --> 01:33:57,604
When the amount is
transferred to you.

1294
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:02,021
Encash it and give it to me.

1295
01:34:04,187 --> 01:34:10,187
Or else, I'll ensure everyone
hears your sweet voice on the call.

1296
01:34:15,729 --> 01:34:18,771
That's alright but,
why did you marry me?

1297
01:34:19,979 --> 01:34:21,604
Everything was clear with Ajay.

1298
01:34:22,646 --> 01:34:24,771
Why didn't I leave their parents?

1299
01:34:25,896 --> 01:34:27,336
That's another doubt
you have, right?

1300
01:34:31,562 --> 01:34:32,646
After Ajay's death...

1301
01:34:32,687 --> 01:34:34,896
I wanted to get rid of them.
That was the plan.

1302
01:34:35,771 --> 01:34:37,979
I was thinking of a way out.

1303
01:34:38,312 --> 01:34:41,312
Then Ajay's father,
came to me with an envelope.

1304
01:34:41,396 --> 01:34:43,021
This is Ajay's insurance cheque.

1305
01:34:45,312 --> 01:34:46,646
Keep it with you, uncle.

1306
01:34:46,979 --> 01:34:47,979
Why would I need it?

1307
01:34:48,437 --> 01:34:51,312
It might not be of help now,
but it might help later.

1308
01:34:52,437 --> 01:34:53,729
When later?

1309
01:34:54,271 --> 01:34:55,646
You might not like it now.

1310
01:34:55,979 --> 01:34:57,062
But it's necessary.

1311
01:34:57,479 --> 01:34:59,062
You might not be able
to forget Ajay.

1312
01:34:59,896 --> 01:35:01,687
It's not right for you to take
too long.

1313
01:35:02,771 --> 01:35:04,312
You have to get married again.

1314
01:35:07,021 --> 01:35:07,896
No, uncle!

1315
01:35:07,937 --> 01:35:09,104
Don't say that!

1316
01:35:09,354 --> 01:35:11,271
I would like to find you a nice guy
to marry...

1317
01:35:12,271 --> 01:35:13,771
And hand this money to you.

1318
01:35:14,021 --> 01:35:15,937
That's all we need in life.

1319
01:35:16,604 --> 01:35:19,062
This money belongs to you, uncle.

1320
01:35:19,979 --> 01:35:22,646
You have to keep it
for your financial security.

1321
01:35:22,812 --> 01:35:24,896
If something happens to me someday

1322
01:35:25,437 --> 01:35:27,562
What will you do?

1323
01:35:28,604 --> 01:35:30,729
We won't need 2 crores anytime soon.

1324
01:35:31,021 --> 01:35:32,812
This isn't the age
to enjoy it either.

1325
01:35:33,521 --> 01:35:34,937
What can we do with this money?

1326
01:35:35,062 --> 01:35:37,479
I'll hand this money over to you
as soon as you get married.

1327
01:35:38,187 --> 01:35:39,646
You'll be sorted for life.

1328
01:35:40,312 --> 01:35:41,646
That will make us really happy.

1329
01:35:42,146 --> 01:35:43,826
They made up their mind,
to get me married.

1330
01:35:44,646 --> 01:35:46,326
I'd be stuck if I
married a man they chose.

1331
01:35:48,271 --> 01:35:51,896
I knew your malicious intentions
the moment I met you.

1332
01:35:52,312 --> 01:35:53,771
I thought if I married you...

1333
01:35:54,187 --> 01:35:57,521
I could throw some money at you
and leave you.

1334
01:35:58,312 --> 01:35:59,854
All my problems would be solved.

1335
01:36:00,896 --> 01:36:02,646

The project is done.

1339
01:36:18,021 --> 01:36:21,479
I need the money in two days.

1340
01:36:22,771 --> 01:36:27,021
Or else, you know what could happen.

1341
01:36:36,812 --> 01:36:38,521
I have to pay the
manager right away.

1342
01:36:38,937 --> 01:36:44,187
Paying him is not the problem,
But will he leave me alone later?

1343
01:36:44,562 --> 01:36:46,979
Okay, I'll pull you
out of this mess.

1344
01:36:47,729 --> 01:36:50,229
In exchange I'd like a share
out of whatever you may get.

1345
01:36:50,687 --> 01:36:51,854
Get me out of this and...

1346
01:36:52,187 --> 01:36:53,627
I'll give you however much you want.

1347
01:36:54,062 --> 01:36:56,479
I don't need a lot,
just give me 50 lakhs.

1348
01:36:56,521 --> 01:37:00,021
I'll get 20 crores,
I could give you more.

1349
01:37:00,896 --> 01:37:03,062
I don't need that much,
just 50 lakhs is enough

1350

If I ask more, you may
plan to kill me. I'm not greedy.

1351
01:37:09,437 --> 01:37:11,229
Okay. Tell me the plan.

1352
01:37:30,146 --> 01:37:31,729
Yes! I got it!

1353
01:37:31,937 --> 01:37:33,687
First, call the Korean company guy.

1354
01:37:33,729 --> 01:37:35,455
Tell him that you'll finish
the project by tomorrow.

1355

Ask them to transfer money
to your account by tomorrow evening.

1356
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:41,602
Make sure they transfer it to
your offshore account.

1357
01:37:41,896 --> 01:37:44,396
Should we encash it immediately
and give it to the manager?

1358
01:37:44,646 --> 01:37:45,966
- Will you let me finish?
- Sorry.

1359
01:37:46,354 --> 01:37:46,956
Go on!

01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:49,354

I'll set him up.

There's another building.

I'll use a pair of binoculars
to keep an eye on you.

1394

He'll come there and exit his car
to come upstairs

the floor you're on,

Apply fake blood to your dress.

1399
01:42:26,604 --> 01:42:29,437
It should look like someone
just stabbed you with a knife.

1400
01:42:42,646 --> 01:42:44,771
Now the real story begins.

1401
01:42:54,708 --> 01:42:56,601
The bag next to you will be empty.

1402
01:42:56,625 --> 01:42:58,771
He'll think someone must have
killed you for money.

1403
01:43:00,354 --> 01:43:03,021
He'll assume someone knew that
you were coming with money.

1404
01:43:03,479 --> 01:43:04,206
That they killed you...

1405
01:43:04,230 --> 01:43:05,708
And ran away with the money.

1406
01:43:06,354 --> 01:43:07,979
This will be a massive shock to him.

1407
01:43:08,437 --> 01:43:11,062
He will have no choice
but to run away.

1408
01:43:11,771 --> 01:43:12,771
That's my plan.

1409
01:43:14,896 --> 01:43:15,896
How is my plan?

1410
01:43:18,104 --> 01:43:19,521
It's perfect!

1411
01:43:20,396 --> 01:43:22,288
He'll assume I'm dead.

1412
01:43:22,312 --> 01:43:23,979
He won't even think about me
anymore.

1413
01:43:24,625 --> 01:43:29,521
Even if he suspects something later,
he will keep his mouth shut.

1414
01:43:32,229 --> 01:43:33,354

1420

On the 7th floor.

- Yeah!

1427

His car is here.

1428
01:45:23,604 --> 01:45:25,021
He's on the first floor.

Hello?
What happened?

1432
01:46:00,354 --> 01:46:01,979
I'm dying here.

1433
01:46:02,562 --> 01:46:05,271
I saw him on the third floor,
but then he disappeared abruptly.

1434
01:46:07,146 --> 01:46:07,854

1435
01:46:08,104 --> 01:46:09,312

I can't wait anymore,
should I go and check?

to come at my beck and call!
