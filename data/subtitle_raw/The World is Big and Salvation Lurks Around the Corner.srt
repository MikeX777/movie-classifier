1
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
My life began on 15.09.1976

2
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Somewhere on the Balkans where Europe ends but never begins.

3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is my mother. Tender and good, she lives mostly in the world of books and music.

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hesitant and beautiful, like the tapestries that she embroiders.

5
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
My father always being restless, he is always in a hurry not to miss something.

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Planning, looking for new ways and he walks along them until the end.

7
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
In the expectation of my birth my granny was feverishly looking for sugar, for the event.

8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Desperately addicted to sweets, she was convinced that the world was spinning around a sugar cube.
Did they brought sugar?

9
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's how they called her: Sweet Granny. 

10
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
When sugar disapeared from the shops the bitter taste of despair.
Sugar? No, there isn't.

11
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But the world is big and she knew that sugar-cane was growing somewhere.

12
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Sugar?
But, hey lady, please where are you going?!
We have a queue here! Aren't you ashamed?
You went before all of us!

13
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The cafe, the secret capital of the backgammon players.

14
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That day my grandpa had an important battle. 

15
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The backgammon king was going to be proclaimed.

16
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:33,000
They call my grandpa Baj Dan. Dan - from Yordan, and baj is a honorable address to a man who has a special attitude to dice.

17
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Baj Dan - the dice master. 

18
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
They had been playing from the morning. It was getting on for the result ...

19
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
... and in this very moment I decided to show up.

20
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This is a tolumbichka, this is baklavichka, this is maslenka ...
Zlatke, where did you find sugar?

21
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Fidel Castro sent to us from Cuba.
The world is big and salvation lurks around the corner.

22
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
For my grandson Alexander, cheers!
Cheers!

23
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Thus my story begins.

24
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The story of Alexander Georgiev, pet name - Sashko.

25
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The world is big and evertbody calls you whatever he wants.

26
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The kids ... they had a car accident. Sashko is alive in a hospital ... Yana and Vasko ... 

27
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Hello!

28
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
How are you?
Do you understand me?

29
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What is your name?
Do you understand me?

30
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't know. 
What is your name?

31
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I don't remember, I ... 

32
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Good day! How can I help you?
Good day! I am looking for my grandson, Alexander Georgiev. 
A moment ... 

33
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Room 17, this way.

34
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Here I am Sashe! I'm here. Come here, my boy! 

35
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
How are you, my child? It's me, your grandpa Yordan from Bulgaria! 

36
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Didn't you recognize me? You are okay?

37
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Tell me you're okay! 
I don't know, I ... I, please ... I ...don't know you ... I ...
Sashe!

38
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Look at me! It's me, your grandpa. 

39
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I come from home. Remeber? 

40
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Your Sweet Granny?! She made baklava for you when you were child?!
Remember?

41
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I taught you to play backgammon?! The song ... do you remeber? 

42
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He who knows, plays backgammon. He who doesn't know ... 1, 2, 3 
What's going on?

43
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Please, tell this man to go away, I ... I don't know who he is ... 
Please, leave the room!

44
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Sashe!

45
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
He who knows, plays backgammon. He who doesn't know ... Play bravely and fearlessly. 

46
00:12:52,003 --> 00:13:07,000
In the worst case you'll get beaten! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (2) 
"djushesh"

47
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Be careful! Grandpa throws!

48
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Sorry, they should have warned you beforehand 

49
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
that your grandson wouldn't recognize you. I will talk to him and inform him.

50
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
How is he, doc? will he be okay? 

51
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Fortunately, Mr. Georgiev hasn't been physically affected seriously. 

52
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
He has a retrograde amnesia. 
Amnesia?

53
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:36,000
Yes. He doesn't remember anything before the accident.

54
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Because of the trauma a slight biochemical disbalance has appeared in the cortex.

55
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But with the help of the modern medicines we can successfully control the illness.

56
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Even if he does not recover his memory, there are social programs

57
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
which will help him manage.
So that he live like a ... cretin?

58
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
My grandson has lost his past.
I will help him!

59
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Calm down, Mr. Balabanov.
He doesn't even know that his parents are dead.

60
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This news could harm him seriously. We will decide when is the best time to tell him.

61
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You want me to lie?
Everything is for his well being.

62
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yes, I understand ... yes, yes.
(BG: says you!)

63
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Grandpa may I throw?
Be careful!

64
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Peyo, bring some rakiya! Today, it's my treat! 

65
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yordan Balabanov's grandson asked for the dice!
Bravo!!! Come on, cheers!!!

66
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Cheers for the young master! 
Aaah, like father, like son!

67
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Cheers for the master, may you become the best!!!

68
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Ivane, make way for the youth!

69
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Come on, master! Now ... a man's word!

70
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We don't play for money, only for honor.

71
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I didn't hear a man's word. Do you promise?

72
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I promise!

73
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Take the dice! You have to trust the dice, my boy.

74
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Think of two numbers! 

75
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Six and one.
Throw, let's see!

76
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Bravo! Well done!

77
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Bravo, my kid, see how have you grown up!
Bravo, granny's sugar cube!

78
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Can you see how you grow up when you listen?

79
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:55,000
Come near the table and fold these napkins!
Where are the candles?

80
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You're going to blow the candles now, aren't you? The matches?

81
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Sashe, your grandpa! 

82
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Give it, Give it!
Give it.Don't tease the boy!

83
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Happy birthday, Sashko!
Break this backgammon from play!

84
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Ehaaa, thank you grandpa!

85
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
This time you've outdone yourself. 

86
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Now a photograph! Prepare!
Come on, cheese!

87
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Alexander Georgiev's home. Unfortunately, I am not home. Please, leave a message after the signal.
Thanks!

88
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Good evening, Mr. Georgiev,it's Vitechek from the translators' bureau.

89
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
We expect your translation for the vacuum cleaner PX510

90
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You had promised that you would be ready a week ago. Please, call back!

91
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I brought you some pictures. 

92
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Who are these?
Your mother and your father. 

93
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Sweet Granny, this is you, this is me, your mother, and your father.

94
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I don't remember them. 

95
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Sashe, this was your birthday. You got 7.

96
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You really don't remember? 
No! Really!

97
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:29,000
All of these are unknown to me. I don't remember any of them. Mum, dad, I don't remember myself! Enough of this!

98
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Sashe, you will remember everything! 

99
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You will remember everything ...

100
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
This backgammon ... I made it for you. 

101
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I found it at your place last night. 

102
00:22:47,003 --> 00:22:50,000
You came into my home? How?

103
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Not very legally ... 

104
00:22:55,003 --> 00:23:04,000
Illegally ... ?
You arrive, you rush in ... good ... good, super ... 

105
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You're probably my grandfather ... You've come all the way from Bulgaria! A great gesture!

106
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But, please, it's already time to go away now. Please, leave me alone, I don't remember you!

107
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Sashe, ... Sashe,
I don't remember you!

108
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Grandpa and Grandma - Yordan, Sladka (Sweet)?

109
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
If you don't feel like talking ... let's play one game of backgammon.

110
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I don't enjoy this kind of games.

111
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Let's play just one game. 

112
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I am not lucky. 
Backgammon has nothing to do with luck.

113
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I taught you once. Come on!

114
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
You see? You haven't forgotten. 

115
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
"Epetsi".
This isn't very good, is it?

116
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It's good, it's good. There's no bad dice, there's only a bad player.

117
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It depends on how you play it. You have to move your pieces so as to take them out first.

118
00:25:35,003 --> 00:25:39,000
But at the same time you have to obstruct your opponent to do the same.

119
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You put barriers - kapii. 

120
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Two pieces.

121
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
See, "epetsi", the smallest dice but it works very well.

122
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:59,000
You close the Bosphorus from one side, Dardanelles from the other

123
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
and your enemy is captured in the middle of the Black Sea not being able to move at all.

124
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
This is "djushesh", you can't throw more than that.

125
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
But you could lose despite the "djushesh". Especially now that my "six" is blocked.

126
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But ... there is always the next throw. 

127
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Aaah, the man can't hit the board, give him a trough to throw there.

128
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Our home militia has come to keep watch over us ... and you're showing such a bad game. 

129
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Comrade militiaman, why are you looking at me ... so warmly? 

130
00:26:55,003 --> 00:27:00,000
You've been here not once, you must have learnt it already?!

131
00:27:00,003 --> 00:27:03,000
Let's play one game?

132
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You don't want? Because those who don't play never lose. 

133
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
But here we all play.

134
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
So if you play the kibitzer, you could get a board on your head.

135
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
He's leaving.

136
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Vasko, Vasko!
You are summoned in the "Staff" section.

137
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Ah, Georgiev! 

138
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
The situation is not very good, Georgiev!
Why, what happened?

139
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Interesting things. You served as a soldier in Samokov - rocket corps.

140
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:51,000
While you were on duty you quarel with the superior and you beat him up. That's what it reads here.

141
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Six months in the garrison prison. They expel you from the Comsomol.

142
00:28:57,003 --> 00:29:00,000
You are released from the army in 1971. 

143
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:06,000
You apply to study in Sofia but you skip to inform that you were expelled from the Comsomol.

144
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You submit fake record from the army. Here's a copy.

145
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
The comrades didn't notice it then and they accepted you.

146
00:29:16,003 --> 00:29:19,000
You graduated, but one day everything comes to light.

147
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
What should I do with you?  

148
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You're capable boy as I see. 

149
00:29:30,003 --> 00:29:35,000
You have a wife and a child may they be alive and well.
Everybody makes mistakes.

150
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You're still young. Life is before you. 

151
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
What do you want from me? 

152
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Your father-in-law - Yordan Balabanov, whom they call Baj Dan.

153
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
He was a  cyclist, he won the Tour if Bulgaria in 1954.

154
00:30:02,003 --> 00:30:05,000
He gets a scholarship and studies for 2 years in GDR.

155
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
During the events in Hungary he organizes students protests.

156
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
He was sent back to Bulgaria and ... what does he do?

157
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
He blows up Stalin's monument with dynamite.

158
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Sentenced to death, reprieved.

159
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
15 years round the prisons and still he hasn't learned sense.

160
00:30:26,003 --> 00:30:28,000
He doesn't stop flapping his mouth.

161
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
He speaks against the authority he mocks with it. 

162
00:30:32,003 --> 00:30:36,000
He's only interested in backgammon.
I don't think so.

163
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
We won't bother him for the time being despite the private buisness with the backgammon boards.

164
00:30:42,003 --> 00:30:46,000
In the workshop downstairs - in the basement. 
What do you want from me?

165
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
You record his words against the authorities. Legibly and meticulously.

166
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
The other players' words too. Your coleagues' too if they happen to drop something. 

167
00:30:57,003 --> 00:31:00,000
You bring the information to me. 

168
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Sign this declaration.

169
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Let me think for a while. 
Think, but not for too long ...

170
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And ... if I don't sign?
Bad things follows. Very bad. 

171
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
We'll take away your diploma, you will be fired, your wife too.

172
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Prison for falsifying documents.

173
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Is this enough? I could continue. 

174
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Bad thing ... but what to do.

175
00:32:28,003 --> 00:32:32,000
One never knows what will befall him.

176
00:32:32,003 --> 00:32:35,000
I hope the boy gets better. 

177
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:39,000
I noticed that I haven't seen him for a while. 

178
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
But I didn't know about the accident.
One more tea?

179
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Do you know his friends? 
No, he was always alone. 

180
00:32:55,003 --> 00:33:00,000
What about his girlfriend?
I haven's seen any. 

181
00:33:00,003 --> 00:33:04,000
He's confused, he has accepted the facts.

182
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I've been observing him for three weeks now.

183
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
He lies in bed all day long.

184
00:33:14,003 --> 00:33:18,000
as though he's waiting for the Last Judgement.

185
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'll take this cane for 1 or 2 days.
Yes, please.

186
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Thank you!

187
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Dear comrades, we've lost the great friend of Bulgaria,

188
00:33:40,003 --> 00:33:48,000
the general secretary of the CC of SUCP, comrade Leonid Brezhnev.

189
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Our hearts are filled with sorrow.

190
00:33:53,003 --> 00:33:57,000
I suggest that we send a telegram of condolence to the Soviet Embassy.

191
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Because, despite death our friendship is undestructable.

192
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
The friendship between Soviet Union and People's Republic of Bulgaria,

193
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:36,000
between SUCP and BCP. SUCP, BCP/ SUCP, BCP ... 

194
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Ah, Georgiev!

195
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That's the way!
You will succeed in this life, Georgiev, you will succeed!

196
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Vasko, you're soaking!
Do you want something to warm you?

197
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yes!
Let's paly one game.

198
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
You want to tell me something?

199
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
You are holding up my game. I cannot go further. 

200
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Look around, there is always a move.

201
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Whatever I throw, it's sensless. 

202
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:30,000
When the situation seems hopeless you change the tactics.

203
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:40,000
How?
Risk. Play bravely!

204
00:37:40,003 --> 00:37:43,000
No matter the outcome.

205
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Come on, turn this thing off. 
There's news in a while.

206
00:38:15,003 --> 00:38:17,000
News?
Yes.

207
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Now I will show you some news!

208
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Get up!
Are you out of you mind?
You have to move, boy!

209
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Unglue from this TV!They brainwash you!

210
00:38:31,003 --> 00:38:35,000
Get up or I will get you out along with the bed!

211
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Get up!
You're crazy!
Come on!

212
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
At last! The boy could jump heh! You can even more!

213
00:38:51,003 --> 00:38:57,000
Leave me alone!
I will get you out of that room!
Please stop, it hurts! Enough!

214
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
And don't mess with my life!
Great life you have!

215
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Among cacuum cleaner boxes, you translate guide books!

216
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Lying here, moaning, grumbling like an old woman!

217
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
You need a change, boy! There's nothing better than change!

218
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Coward! 
Enough!

219
00:39:22,003 --> 00:39:25,000
I promise, I will beat you until you go with me.

220
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Here's your news.
Okay, I'm going!

221
00:39:30,003 --> 00:39:33,000
See what you've done!

222
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Sweet Granny wants to see you, I am bringing you home!

223
00:39:37,003 --> 00:39:39,000
Where home?
Bulgaria. 

224
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:44,000
No, I am not going anywhere, I am ill and ...
So you're ill ... I will cure you right away!

225
00:39:45,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Stop it!
Mr. Balabanov!

226
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Mr. Balabanov you can't do this. You can't just leave the room like that!

227
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Dear nurse Baumgartner, we know each other well already.

228
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I am the new physician and I prescribe movement, fresh air and conversing!

229
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:10,000
We stop the pills and we're going for coffee!
Come on!

230
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Now, we're heading to "Mars"!

231
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
The next one is mine!

232
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
You beat me again!
This depends only on you!

233
00:41:07,003 --> 00:41:11,000
On me? Dice is just chance!
Chance? Yes!
How come, Sashe?!

234
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,000
You hold the dice in your hands, don't you?
with what force are you throwing them, the angle ...

235
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
You need 4, this is the only way to beat me.

236
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Bravo, master, first victory. We'll celebrate, huh?
You start getting better!

237
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
You say this!
I will show you something. Backgammon has 6 "kapii".

238
00:41:41,003 --> 00:41:48,000
Here they are! The most important are the Royal and the Heavenly one.

239
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
"kapii" are taken in order. Today you took the first "kapia".

240
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
You need 5 more, when you get them you'll be ready.

241
00:42:01,003 --> 00:42:04,000
You will remember everything.

242
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
I am a bit scared.
Of what?

243
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I am scared that ... when my mother and father come ... I will not recognize them.

244
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Just like I couldn't recognize you. Tell me who are they, and ... who am I.

245
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,000
You're Alexander. Not everybody has the good fortune to be named Alexander.

246
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Did you renounce Satan?
I did.

247
00:42:58,003 --> 00:43:01,000
Did you combine with Christ?
Yes, I did.

248
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Do you believe in Him?
I do.

249
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Come here.

250
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
How do we name him?
Alexander.

251
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I decided that we leave.
What?

252
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
To the west - Germany.

253
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
I'm serious. We'll do it this summer. 

254
00:43:55,003 --> 00:44:00,000
As if we're going on a sea vacation.
But ...
We have to leave.

255
00:44:00,003 --> 00:44:04,000
What about Sashko?
Sashko is coming with us. 

256
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
There he'll have better future.

257
00:44:08,003 --> 00:44:12,000
You'll see.
Do you hear yourself?

258
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
We're not going anywhere.

259
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
How dare you? This is a hospital!

260
00:44:42,003 --> 00:44:51,000
We're drinking.
You brought alcohol. You undermine the treatment.
This is irresponsible.

261
00:44:51,003 --> 00:44:54,000
This is a fantastic therapy, Dr. Schneider.

262
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Medicines and lies.

263
00:44:58,003 --> 00:45:01,000
He's been here for more than a month now.

264
00:45:01,003 --> 00:45:04,000
You are not competent.

265
00:45:04,003 --> 00:45:07,000
Out! Go out or I'll call the guards.

266
00:45:07,003 --> 00:45:11,000
Who are you threatening, huh?

267
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Sashe ... Sashe, those jerks won't help you. They don't care about you.

268
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
They lie to you. 
What for?

269
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:48,000
See ... dear, your mother and your father, they won't come.

270
00:45:48,003 --> 00:45:51,000
Never.

271
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
How ... never.
They are dead, Sashe.

272
00:45:59,003 --> 00:46:06,000
They died in the accident. You were together.

273
00:46:06,003 --> 00:46:12,000
No, no, no, it's not true ...
It is, my boy, it is true!

274
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:26,000
They won't come. But you can catch them in your memory.

275
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:39,000
When you come back where I come from, there ... there ... where you come from.

276
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I will help you.
Now out!

277
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:46,000
Please leave the room. 

278
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Don't touch me!

279
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Sashe, pull yourself together and go away from here.

280
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Come on.

281
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Fuck you!

282
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
For the New Year I wish that me, and Sashko to begin a new life.

283
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:33,000
To the west. Free, rich and happy. Agree?

284
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Agree.

285
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Come on, quickly!
Happy New Year!!! (1983)

286
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Leave these things, I will buy you real paintings from there.
There's no room for my things but there's enough for this woodwork.

287
00:48:53,003 --> 00:48:57,000
This woodwork is a present for Sashko from your father and you stuff the suitcase with trash.

288
00:48:57,003 --> 00:49:01,000
Anything that doesn't concern your flee is trash.
My flee?

289
00:49:01,003 --> 00:49:06,000
Can't you see I'm doing this for us? If it dependet on you we would have lived here all our lives here in this den.

290
00:49:06,003 --> 00:49:09,000
Den? You lived in a den before you married me!

291
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Is there anything mine that matters to you? I'm asking you!
Quiet, your parents will hear. 
Let them hear!

292
00:49:14,003 --> 00:49:17,000
I can't stand this any more. I can't hide from them any more, I can't lie them.

293
00:49:17,003 --> 00:49:21,000
God knows when am I going to see them again.

294
00:49:21,003 --> 00:49:24,000
I won't come.
You won't come?
I won't.

295
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:28,000
You come, or you do whatever you want

296
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Sashe, come dear.
Everything' alright, Sashe!

297
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
A little child was picking blueberries.
He sang songs and gathered two baskets.

298
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:26,000
But he got lost in the woods. It started to get dark.
The kid remembered his mother and started crying.

299
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Let me see him.
Here he is!

300
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:38,000
It was so dark in the wood. No light, no woodman, no bird were there.
Will the child get scared? Will he stop? 

301
00:50:38,003 --> 00:50:41,000
No, his mum's waiting for him, she does.

302
00:50:41,003 --> 00:50:53,000
At once he looks at distance, in defiance to the wind,
a thin, glowing strip - this was the white path.

303
00:50:53,003 --> 00:51:03,000
"Follow me", said the path, "you'll have to walk for a whole hour, but I promise I will bring you home."

304
00:51:03,003 --> 00:51:14,000
The child ran towards home. The path ran with him too. And just in front of mummy's home the path stopped the child.

305
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
It took you so long! I think you took the second "kapia".

306
00:52:05,003 --> 00:52:08,000
Let's play one game.

307
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Sashe, come to say goodbye to granny and grandpa.

308
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Sashe, if one day you want to tell me something very important, tell it to a cloud that is flowing in the sky.

309
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
When it comes here it will tell me about it. 
Like through the mail?

310
00:53:12,003 --> 00:53:17,000
Exactly!
How do we throw the dice?

311
00:53:17,003 --> 00:53:24,000
I think of one number, throw and win.
Bravo, master!

312
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Listen to your parents ... granny's sugar cube!

313
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
May my mum and dad rest in peace.
May they rest in peace.

314
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
What is this for?
We'll travel by this.

315
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Can't we take a bus or plane?
Who travels by bycicle?

316
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:56,000
This is not a bycivle but a tandem. There is an enormous difference between the vehicles you just mentioned and ours.

317
00:55:56,003 --> 00:56:03,000
What is it?
We can see the sky, feel the road, the motion, the air.

318
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
We travel, we are not transported. 

319
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Give me the luggage.

320
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Have a pleasant journey and be healthy

321
00:56:18,003 --> 00:56:22,000
I prepared some sweets for the trip. 

322
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:29,000
Alex, you have a fantastic grandpa. Listen to him

323
00:56:29,003 --> 00:56:32,000
Thank you, "komshu" (Tr: neighbour)!

324
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Thank you for everything!
Thank you!

325
00:56:37,003 --> 00:56:40,000
Alexander Georgiev, are you ready for jorney?
No, we don't have helmets.

326
00:56:40,003 --> 00:56:43,000
Is it allowed to ... 
Yes, I asked the Pope!

327
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
He said yes. Come on!

328
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
What are those tricks? I won't do the whole work.

329
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I am leading, this is more important

330
00:57:52,003 --> 00:57:59,000
You don't have a clue where you want to go. I am the brain, you are the muscle!

331
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Hey, watch the road we'll kill ourselves!
Where are we going?
Turkey,

332
00:58:05,003 --> 00:58:08,000
India, China

333
00:58:08,003 --> 00:58:12,000
Silk Road!
Ah, yes, Tokyo!
Yes.

334
00:58:12,003 --> 00:58:16,000
To Tokyo by boat and then by plane to America. 

335
00:58:16,003 --> 00:58:23,000
Then with the tandem through the prairies, to the Grand Canyon, New York.

336
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Then people will cry: "Here are the champions!" and they will offer us ice cream.

337
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Why do we carry around this pot?
For your granny.

338
00:58:36,003 --> 00:58:40,000
She will plant this flower in the garden.
You are crazy.

339
00:58:40,003 --> 00:58:43,000
Everybody says this.

340
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I have to pee.
Not now. Quickly!

341
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,000
This is the border. This is Italy out there.

342
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Now, come on.

343
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
No, no, come on, quickly! 

344
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
The commandant asks you to sign.

345
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,000
What's this?
This is a declaration that you voluntarily accept the rules of the lager.

346
01:02:25,003 --> 01:02:31,000
But here everything is in Italian ...
I'm sorry but you have to sign.

347
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Why did you escape?

348
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,000
In Bulgaria I was made to spy my relatives. They would have put me in prison if I denied.

349
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:07,000
I just want to add something ... 
It's futile he's heard enough already. Come on.

350
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Here, this part is Eastern Europe, over there are the Arabians.

351
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,000
These are the Czechs. In those rooms are the Romanians. There are the Hungarians.

352
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Don't worry, everything will be alright. Let me explain ... 

353
01:03:30,003 --> 01:03:34,000
You applied for political asylum. The bad thing is that Italy doesn't offer such.

354
01:03:34,003 --> 01:03:38,000
You must choose another country and apply there, which will take time.

355
01:03:38,003 --> 01:03:43,000
There aren't many options. Australia, South Africa, Argentina.

356
01:03:43,003 --> 01:03:49,000
USA is possibility but only if somebody sends declaration that he knows you and guarantee for you.

357
01:03:49,003 --> 01:03:52,000
This is the situation. 

358
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Cheer up!

359
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
It's ready.

360
01:04:09,003 --> 01:04:11,000
Thanks, Chicago, come to introduce you.

361
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Pleased to meet you, I am Ivo Chicago.
Thanks, Yana.

362
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Sasho.
Sasho, ah, there's some spot here ...

363
01:04:25,003 --> 01:04:31,000
Ha, I got you, one for me!
Come on, you make yourselves comfortable here, then I'll show you where the food is.
Thank you, guys

364
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Here our diet consists of pasta. Pasta in the morning, pasta in the evening, pasta at lunch ... 

365
01:04:51,003 --> 01:04:57,000
Pasta in the workdays but in holidays - surprise! - pasta again. That's it.

366
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I like pasta, with bolognese.
Bolognese, bolognese from Bologna.

367
01:05:05,003 --> 01:05:14,000
In the begining I liked them a lot too, but ... then bolognese, molognese ... all of them are shit! You'll hate them.

368
01:05:14,003 --> 01:05:19,000
Yes, if I eat them a whole month, probably I would hate them too.
I've been eating them for 3 years already.

369
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
What?
Yes, yes, 3 years.

370
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Me, only 9 months. 

371
01:05:29,003 --> 01:05:32,000
My and my sister have been here for about 2 years already.

372
01:05:32,003 --> 01:05:39,000
And we're here just for a while.
Huh, everybody say so. You'll hang around here for 3 or 4 years as easy as anything.

373
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I'm leaving.
Yana, where're you going?
Home!

374
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Leave me alone! Take me home! Do you hear me? I hate you!

375
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Today we'll talk about imagination. 

376
01:06:20,001 --> 01:06:23,000
What? Imagination?
Yes, Imagination. 

377
01:06:23,003 --> 01:06:28,000
The elixir of every game.
Tell me, what is this car?

378
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Some rattle-trap.
Oooh, this is a brand new limousine.
Oh, is it?

379
01:06:32,003 --> 01:06:37,000
Ah, yes, it's true.
But who's in?

380
01:06:37,003 --> 01:06:40,000
Where should I know?
Imagine!

381
01:06:40,003 --> 01:06:44,000
A depressed man. 
And why's he depressed?

382
01:06:44,003 --> 01:06:50,000
He owes an enormous credit. And next to him an appalling, fat woman is sitting.

383
01:06:50,003 --> 01:06:55,000
Who's throwing his money out of the window instead of throwing herself.

384
01:06:55,003 --> 01:06:59,000
You start very well.
What about the next car?

385
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,000
A beautiful woman. Making the radio louder.

386
01:07:04,003 --> 01:07:08,000
What do they say on the radio?
Where should I know?
Try to remember!

387
01:07:08,003 --> 01:07:11,000
I can't.
Imagine.

388
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Some babbling, where should I know?
Coughing, sneezing, ... an interview with a pop singer.

389
01:07:19,003 --> 01:07:25,000
A crazy old bitch: "I'm sorry, but shouldn't you be dead already?"
"Oh, yes, yes, thank you!"

390
01:07:25,003 --> 01:07:29,000
That was mean! It wasn't bad. Come on.
You're annoying me!

391
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:31,000
Tell me about the radio.
Stop this dullness!

392
01:07:31,003 --> 01:07:39,000
Tell me about the radio.
Ok, radio, radio, radio ... Dear listeners this is Radio Balkan.

393
01:07:39,003 --> 01:07:43,000
Yes, good day!
Information about the traffic

394
01:07:43,003 --> 01:07:50,000
The traffic is heavy on A22. Oh, an emergency announcment from Sweet Granny:

395
01:07:50,003 --> 01:07:54,000
"Don't forget to water my flower! And eat well!"

396
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:58,000
No, Sweet Granny, no, we won't forget.

397
01:07:58,003 --> 01:08:02,000
The weather: heavy snowfall and strong wind.

398
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Caution! Caution!

399
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:13,000
To all the luminaries! It's coming ... One ...

400
01:08:13,003 --> 01:08:16,000
One ... one ... sirtaki!

401
01:08:16,003 --> 01:08:21,000
It will meet you and challenge you.
Turbulent masses moving.

402
01:08:21,003 --> 01:08:26,000
From north to south, from west to east, and then from south to north ... 

403
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:42,000
That was good, Sashe! Very good! You might be a good player.

404
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Like you?
Ah, not that good!

405
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Oh, my God!

406
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
You didn't know that they would cross the border?

407
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:17,000
You live in the same house, you eat on the same table but you didn't know?

408
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Eh, they didn't know, they didn't know ... 
But we ...

409
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Come on, show me the workshop now.

410
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
You don't want to? Let me lead you then.

411
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Big manufacture happened here!

412
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
You do business here, huh?

413
01:09:55,003 --> 01:09:59,000
When we add the things that your son-in-law wrote about you ... 

414
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
and the words that you speak against the authorities ... 

415
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
and assisting an escape over the border ... 

416
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Here we are again in prison.

417
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Many years await you.

418
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Put him the handcuffs!

419
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Sitting there in the cafe, I learned some things about backgammon.

420
01:10:26,003 --> 01:10:31,000
But I liked most what you said about the board on the head.

421
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Write just your father's address. They'll know it's from us and will know we're ok.

422
01:11:13,003 --> 01:11:17,000
Two words at least!
If you write anything the card will never reach them.

423
01:11:17,003 --> 01:11:23,000
They'll keep it in the millitia, so you put only the address, with your handwriting.

424
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Stoyane, how much is this?
They'll be enough to reach Trieste and buy an ice-cream for the boy.

425
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Daddy, buy me this car.
We don't have money, Sashe.
Please, buy it!
I told you, we don't have money, come on!

426
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Where's the kid?

427
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:52,000
It's okay, dear! You dreamed! I'm with you, everything's fine, Sashe!

428
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Sasho, where were you? Say something, Sasho!
I want to go home.

429
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
We'll go to grandma and grandpa with the car.

430
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Do you want me to show you something?
Grandpa told me this, when I want to tell him something

431
01:16:33,003 --> 01:16:38,000
I whisper it to a cloud, then the cloud goes to grandpa and tells him what I told it.

432
01:16:38,003 --> 01:16:40,000
See!

433
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Grandma, grandpa, do you hear me? I have a new friend. Her name's Marta.

434
01:16:52,003 --> 01:17:00,000
Mum and dad are fine we eat pasta all the time. I miss you but I don't cry

435
01:17:00,003 --> 01:17:04,000
because daddy told me to behave like a man. 

436
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:35,000
They're alive! Thank you, God, they're alive! Do you hear, Dane, they're alive!

437
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Cheers!
Cheers!

438
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
What are you doing, Sashe?
I take my pills. 
What pills?

439
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Anti-depressant, coenzyme, this is for the immune system.
Let me see them.

440
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:18,000
This ... what was its name? For ... brain breathing ... 

441
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
How could you do that?

442
01:19:24,003 --> 01:19:31,000
Now where would I ... 
Now your brain will breathe with this. Guaranteed!

443
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Come on!

444
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,000
You're crazy!

445
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,000
A breath-taking view!
Yes, it is.

446
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Bravo, Sashe, we climbed the top.
You managed!

447
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
You took another "kapia".

448
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Slow down!

449
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I can't. 
Stop! Slower!

450
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
We don't have brakes!
Stop, we'll kill ourselves!

451
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I can't, jump!

452
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Grandpa!

453
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Grandpa, where are you?

454
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Why are you shouting so much!?
Where am I? I'm here!

455
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:12,000
Switzerland - 3 000 000. Austria - 2, France - 3.

456
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Damned rates just for crossing the border!

457
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
How much is it for Germany?
2 000 000

458
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Why Germany, Vasko? I'm for the USA. Where the high houses, the skyscrapers are. 

459
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
I have a brother there in Chicago. He has a house at the Lake Michigan.

460
01:22:36,003 --> 01:22:41,000
People respect him much there. They value him. I expect his invitation any moment now.

461
01:22:41,003 --> 01:22:45,000
And then ... :D

462
01:22:45,003 --> 01:22:48,000
Come on, it's your turn. 
You hurry too much for my victory, wait a minute.

463
01:22:48,003 --> 01:22:53,000
It's true that a donkey and backgammon player understand only thrashing, but still ...

464
01:22:53,003 --> 01:22:57,000
Come on, bang on the head ... that's enough for you. 

465
01:22:57,003 --> 01:23:00,000
You're a great master, Vasko.

466
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:07,000
2 000 000 is too much, damned. Too much.
Money is not a problem for you. 

467
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
How come? This is 2 000 000, where would I find it?

468
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Listen, there is something like bar here.

469
01:23:16,003 --> 01:23:19,000
Just opposite the train station. 

470
01:23:19,003 --> 01:23:23,000
They play all kinds of games there. Even backgammon but ... for money.

471
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I don't play for money.
Stay here then. 

472
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
It has a garage too.

473
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Avanti, avanti ... 
What "avanti", fuck you! I won't eat this shit!

474
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Somebody get up and say clearly what's going on here.

475
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Mr. Commandant!
What do you exactly want?

476
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Mr. Sfortza, I will explain.

477
01:25:41,003 --> 01:25:45,000
We are refugees from a dictatorship.

478
01:25:45,003 --> 01:25:52,000
We are not criminals. We have human rights! You keep us here for years.

479
01:25:52,003 --> 01:25:55,000
You turn us into prisoners.

480
01:25:55,003 --> 01:26:00,000
We don't want our children to grow here. People forgot their profession!

481
01:26:00,003 --> 01:26:04,000
Stop!
We won't take this any more!

482
01:26:04,003 --> 01:26:08,000
We all know that you get 10 $ a day per each one of us.

483
01:26:08,003 --> 01:26:13,000
For us! But you keep them for yourself. That's why we stay here for years.

484
01:26:13,003 --> 01:26:18,000
I've been here for 2 years, too.
Me - 2 years.
Give us back our documents.

485
01:26:18,003 --> 01:26:24,000
Strike! Strike!

486
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Quiet!
We want faster procedures, better food and language courses.

487
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Today we go on a hunger strike.

488
01:26:41,003 --> 01:26:45,000
That's what we've decided.
Who's on the strike? 

489
01:26:45,003 --> 01:26:49,000
All of us. We are all on a strike. 

490
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:52,000
Whoever is on strike to raise their hands.

491
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Very good!
Nobody should have the illusion that

492
01:27:18,003 --> 01:27:23,000
a democratic country would tolerate anarchy and chaos.

493
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I have every right to bringing you back there, where you came from. 

494
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:37,000
We don't need thrashers and vagabonds.

495
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Leave the canteen immediately!

496
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Wretches! You'll rot here!

497
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:03,000
... What?
We'll earn some money.

498
01:29:03,003 --> 01:29:08,000
Count me out. This is illeagal.
Ok, you stay here.

499
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
How much's the game?
20

500
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Come on, 20.

501
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
100, 100 ... 100 ... 

502
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Let me see. Does it hurt?

503
01:30:23,003 --> 01:30:29,000
You're okay! Bastards! Come on!

504
01:30:29,003 --> 01:30:35,000
They've beaten you a little but ... we won some money.

505
01:30:35,003 --> 01:30:38,000
You are not mad, are you? We're going to the sea.

506
01:30:38,003 --> 01:30:44,000
You are crazy! Crazy! We almost died, they've beaten me,

507
01:30:44,003 --> 01:30:48,000
they've robbed me! The only thing left is to arrest me. 

508
01:30:48,003 --> 01:30:56,000
I'm not going further! Give my regards to Bulgaria!
But, Sashe, I'm sorry! Where are you going, Sashe?

509
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Sashe, get off! Get off!!!
Go, go, come on!

510
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
You owe me 8 X the first bet.

511
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:36,000
One more game?
Enough for today.

512
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Somebody else?

513
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
How much do you bet?

514
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:04,000
100 000
This is nothing. 

515
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Good, come on!

516
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:39,000
We'll meet again, there's no way that we don't meet.
The world is small, you'll visit me in Chicago. Yane, cheer up!

517
01:33:39,003 --> 01:33:45,000
Sashe, listen to your parents but ... not too much.
Thank you so much.

518
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
God be with you!

519
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:52,000
We'll spend the night here.
Ok.

520
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Back, back! Go back to the girl! Introduce yourself, ask her where is she from. Should I teach you?

521
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:45,000
That was just a dance.
Dance? Yap-yap I saw how she looked at you. Go back immediately!

522
01:38:45,003 --> 01:38:52,000
But ... I ... 
Don't mumble ... look at you, young, healthy, goodlooking and what is he doing?

523
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Go back immediately or I'll force you!

524
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,000
But I live in Germany.

525
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:45,000
We're going to the beach, are you coming?
Yes. 

526
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:25,000
I don't remember anything before the accident.
I can write and read. 

527
01:41:25,003 --> 01:41:30,000
I know how to use the telephone but I don't know who are the people from my telephone directory.

528
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Now I am gathering my memories again ...

529
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,000
What do you do?
I study ballet. 

530
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
and I work in a salsa-club.

531
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:55,000
When I saw you yesterday there was something sad in you but beautiful.

532
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,000
I wanted you to hug me.

533
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Now where are you going?
Bulgaria. I was born there.

534
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:16,000
We travel with my grandfather and a tandem.
What?

535
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Yes, you both look great.

536
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:30,000
As for me, I'm going back to Germany.

537
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:36,000
The fact that I don't remember my past has its good sides.

538
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,000
It's as though you are the first girl I've been with.

539
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Probably I am ... 

540
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:55,000
The first ... and the only one.

541
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:04,000
So what's her name?
Maria.

542
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Did you fall in love?
Yes.

543
01:43:07,003 --> 01:43:15,000
Bravo, you didn't discredit me. You took the "Heavenly kapia" - the best one.

544
01:43:16,003 --> 01:43:20,000
There are only two left.

545
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Hey, stop there! 

546
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:35,000
I've been here years ago with my mother and father. I want to look around.

547
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:44,000
What's your name?
Alexander Georgiev. My father - Vasil, my mother - Yana.

548
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Sasho, is this you? I am Ivo (the:) Chicago.

549
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Don't you recognize me?

550
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:03,000
See ... I got you again. Two for me.

551
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:14,000
How are your mother and father, Sashe?
They passed away.

552
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Come on!?

553
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Stoyan too, do you remeber uncle Stoyan? The one who knew many languages.

554
01:45:24,003 --> 01:45:30,000
Not long after your departure he got very ill and in about half an year he passed away.

555
01:45:30,003 --> 01:45:35,000
May he rest in peace. And your mother and father too.

556
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,000
What about you?
What about me?

557
01:45:40,003 --> 01:45:45,000
What happened with America?
I never got the invitation from my brother.

558
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:55,000
I tried to call many times but ... 
Probably he didn't need me. He might have died, who knows.

559
01:45:55,003 --> 01:46:00,000
How come dead?
You probably think that people in America never die?

560
01:46:00,003 --> 01:46:04,000
They die like flies. Don't you watch TV? 

561
01:46:04,003 --> 01:46:10,000
You are sitting somewhere, eating your burger, drinking your drink and suddenly

562
01:46:10,003 --> 01:46:15,000
some guy, who's at odds with the world, comes in with a gun that big and he starts shooting in order ... 

563
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Eh, America is hopeless case! I stayed here, Sashe, here. In the lager.

564
01:46:24,000 --> 03:32:30,000
A guard.

565
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Good morning!

566
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Good morning, Sashe!
Where's grandpa?

567
01:48:57,003 --> 01:49:01,000
Early in the morning he left for Bulgaria with the train. He left the board for you.

568
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:40,000
"For new Bulgaria!"

569
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Sashko! Sashe, granny's sugar cube!

570
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Sashko, my grandson!
Come on, Sashe! Welcome! What a man have you become!

571
01:53:27,003 --> 01:53:40,000
He became bigger than us! (song)

572
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:47,000
We'll see him now if he took after his grandpa.
Eeeeh, of course!
Be careful not to cry afterwards.

573
01:53:47,003 --> 01:53:51,000
Oh, no, no ... 
If you're going to withdraw, now is the time to do it.
no, no, no, I'm not ... 

574
01:53:51,003 --> 01:53:56,000
You're not?
No?
No. Come on!!!

575
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Now, the winner would become the one who first get two games in a row. 

576
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:11,000
If it gets dark and we still haven't got a winner, you'll throw the dice.

577
01:54:11,003 --> 01:54:17,000
The one who throws the bigger number he'll become the King of Backgammon. Is it clear? 

578
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Now, let's see, who'll be the first.

579
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Come on, this is for the  kibitzers.

580
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:18,000
All the day none of the players could win two games more than the other.

581
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:28,000
It got dark. Then it became clear that dice must decide who's the King of Backgammon.

582
01:56:28,003 --> 01:56:34,000
Just one throw. The one who throws the bigger nuber wins.

583
01:59:54,000 --> 02:00:01,000
I threw six and seven. Nowhere and never such a thing had happened.

584
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I took the "Royal kapia" - the last one.

585
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:14,000
I was cured. 

586
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:55,000
I could start from the begining. To dream, to play, to lose and to win.

587
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:02,000
To be, now and forever. Because as my grandpa said: 

588
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:07,000
"The world is big and salvation lurks around the corner"
