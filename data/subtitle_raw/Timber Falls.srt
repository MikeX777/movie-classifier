1
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,830
Sarah, run away.

2
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,950
Beautiful.

3
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,830
Leave that.

4
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,630
Good morning.

5
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,550
How can I help you?

6
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:43,830
You are here for the first time
and do not know where to begin.

7
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,350
Something like that.

8
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,870
Allow me here to start.

9
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,630
How long are you off?

10
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,390
A few days until Sunday.

11
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,590
With a reasonable pace,
you get the top tomorrow.

12
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,510
Is there a recommended path?
- Do you experience?

13
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,150
Yes, we have ...
- No, something like this never.

14
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,350
For novices,
I recommend Willow Creek to

15
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,870
or Donner path.

16
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,630
We monitor those routes.

17
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,470
If you lost another route,

18
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,470
it may take
we find for you.

19
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,430
You can find a few people ...
- Many people live here?

20
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,630
A few generations of families as
these mountains their home.

21
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,070
Most of them are friendly.

22
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,190
Respect their country
and they will respect you.

23
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,950
Do you have a first aid kit?
- Yes, we do.

24
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,430
Do not mind him, I am a nurse.
- Super.

25
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,190
Good for you, the question was
if you have a first aid kit?

26
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,190
Yes, we do.
- Great.

27
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,070
See how easy that was?

28
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,350
Thank you

29
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,870
Are you receiving?

30
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,550
We let them in the car.

31
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,110
I love him with me.
- Why?

32
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,830
From habit.
- Are you serious?

33
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,510
If we have a problem, I prefer
a phone to me, that does not work,

34
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,310
than no phone.

35
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,710
Are you ready?

36
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,430
Then we go.

37
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,710
Hey, Einstein,

38
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,070
we will leave the tent here,
or will we take him?

39
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,270
I just wanted to check
or you attention.

40
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,190
I wear this.

41
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,790
It will go well.
- No chance.

42
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:05,390
School Reunions should
but for two things ...

43
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,550
Oh yeah?

44
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,670
The so-called glorious
days of popularity revive

45
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,630
or find out,

46
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:14,310
you're a cow,
because your ex has become a super model.

47
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,310
What were you?
- A 'stoner'.

48
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,110
And what does that mean?

49
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,070
How should I know?
I was always stoned. "

50
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,230
What do you think?

51
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,030
Donner The path ...

52
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,230
or others?

53
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,550
The guide indicates that the
paths have beautiful views.

54
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,670
Well, we are no Lewis and Clark.

55
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,870
Let us choose one of these paths,
the Ranger recommended.

56
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,310
Good morning.

57
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,110
Have you people help?

58
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,630
We consider our network
route options.

59
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,230
Never mind,
you can not choose wrong.

60
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:11,270
The Ranger advised the Donner trail ...
- Or at Willow Creek.

61
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,190
I think Sam
only those two know.

62
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,310
If I had to choose,
Donner path I would take.

63
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,750
Willow Creek brings you quickly to the top
but there is not much to see.

64
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,630
The path winds Donner
to Peddler's Peak.

65
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,670
The view there is very beautiful.

66
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,070
What do you think?

67
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,790
That's a very nice ring.

68
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,950
Thank you

69
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:43,670
It is certainly not a traditional wedding,
but God has the same meaning.

70
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,750
How long have you been married?
- We are not married.

71
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,790
Sorry.
- Not yet anyway.

72
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,630
I got the ring of my father,
then graduated.

73
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:58,510
I am a stupid man.
I gotta deal with my own affairs.

74
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,990
Does not, it's okay.

75
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,190
Which of the two,
has the most open spots?

76
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,070
Open spaces?

77
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,830
None of these two
has many open spaces.

78
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,230
But that path,
Timber Falls ...

79
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,030
has many open spaces
and beautiful vistas.

80
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,950
And the most beautiful waterfalls,
you've ever seen.

81
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,910
That sounds perfect.

82
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,110
But I'll let you decide.

83
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,750
You have no one like me need
you time.

84
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,870
Thank you

85
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,310
Yes, thank you

86
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,510
Thanks for your help.

87
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,670
'Not yet'?

88
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,830
You use your chances, right?

89
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,630
If I see an opportunity ...

90
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,910
That way they spoke,

91
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,150
with waterfalls.
What do you think?

92
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:53,190
I think you will be eaten by a bear
and that no Ranger in the neighborhood is

93
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,590
I and the rest of you,
the mountain down to bear.

94
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,950
We go to Timber Falls.

95
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:10,150
Who are Lewis and Clark actually?

96
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,390
You were really stoned at school.

97
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,510
I unwind here.

98
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,150
That's funny.

99
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,950
I am not affected,
since you omdeed me.

100
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,270
You know no more,
when you gave me.

101
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,030
February 27, 2006.

102
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,310
What are you good.

103
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,190
Hey Lonnie, Brody,

104
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,590
look at this.

105
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,270
It seems ...

106
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,590
whether a party is.

107
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:08,390
No, man, no party.
We ...

108
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,950
on the road to the mountain.

109
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,630
You are more on the way,
or not then?

110
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,030
If a peach.

111
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,950
You must be careful
what you are doing here.

112
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,950
You never know who is meekijkt.

113
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,110
We have learned our lesson,
Thank you.

114
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,670
You guys are city people, huh?

115
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,990
From Charleston for sure.

116
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,230
You will see how the others live?

117
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,150
We are not from Charleston.
We are from Virginia.

118
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,590
We are the weekend here.
And you, you live here?

119
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,110
It is always easy,
for city people to recognize.

120
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:52,950
They try to be nice,
but if they do not.

121
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,670
I think ...

122
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,350
You made us the scare,
that's all.

123
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,430
We want to go.
Can I return?

124
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,470
What you found, you may keep.

125
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,630
Not so rough.

126
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,030
Where are you going?

127
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,390
We just know each other.

128
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,750
We want no problems, okay?
We just want to again.

129
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,470
How do you think we
make problems?

130
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,590
I tell you what ...

131
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,110
Keep you from the 'spirit'?

132
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,790
The what?
- The 'spirit'.

133
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,550
Drink.
- Do you like the 'spirit'?

134
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,030
Sure.
- You know what we do.

135
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,910
You ...

136
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,710
Try this out, city boy.

137
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,910
Come on, test again.

138
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,990
Something you have never tasted, huh.

139
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,910
$ 50.
- What?

140
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:53,510
He is open, now you must buy it.
$ 50 per pot.

141
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,350
Or maybe we can ...

142
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,950
do a barter.

143
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,590
And?

144
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,990
Okay, I grab my wallet.

145
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,310
That's a good idea.

146
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,230
$ 50 seems a bargain.

147
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,670
Pay the man.

148
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,990
This is yours.

149
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,550
It was nice doing business with you.
Take care.

150
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,910
Is everything okay?
- Yes, fine.

151
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,750
Excuse me.

152
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,550
Do you know how many people they die?
I mean children?

153
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,630
I stopped counting.

154
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,190
I thought ...

155
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,190
I do not know what I thought
what do you want me to do?

156
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,950
Put the gun away.
- Disposal ...

157
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,390
Here?

158
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,270
I can not throw away.
One child, someone can find it.

159
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,390
Throw the ball away and when we come home,
you throw that gun away.

160
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,190
Please.

161
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,030
Are they all?
- Yes, everyone.

162
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,190
Thank you.

163
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,230
You are welcome.

164
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,310
Sorry, I wish you not to scare,
I wanted ...

165
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,070
I wanted to hack a path Friday.

166
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,150
The previous week,
we had heavy rain showers

167
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,670
and there are trees
and branches broken off.

168
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,830
One of the newcomers
This was yesterday, but ...

169
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,510
you know how that goes, if you make good
want, you can do better.

170
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,070
It is okay, but we thought
that this route was not patrolled.

171
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,630
Right, that normally happens, but

172
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,510
this is one of my favorite places.
I even think of excuses to come here.

173
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,750
Yes, it is beautiful.

174
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,590
There are other waterfalls,
but ...

175
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,430
no one calls like this like this.

176
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,710
You need me
to believe

177
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,510
look for yourself.
How long do you?

178
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:33,510
This is a short trip
We wanted a few days out of town.

179
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,870
What city, Charleston?

180
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,470
If Charleston is, I understand you.

181
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,790
The smell there feet.

182
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,310
I must go there once a year,
for my health check.

183
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:48,390
Because for one or the other
reason, my doctor here do not.

184
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,830
That place is not for me,
you do?

185
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,910
We are not from Charleston.
- But it seems so similar.

186
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,710
We live in Alexandria,
lying in DC.

187
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,910
Alexandria, I have ever been.

188
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,670
That's a few years ago.

189
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,510
I found that city fun.

190
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,870
There are many beautiful churches,
I remember.

191
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,950
What church are you?

192
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,070
I am not sure. Sheryl ...

193
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,670
what church are we?

194
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,190
At this moment no one.

195
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:31,630
The sun sets and the path
He was not free, so ...

196
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,670
Excuse me, sir.

197
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,190
My name is Clyde.

198
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,550
Clyde, you know a place where we are tonight
can camp?

199
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,830
Yes, tell me that you like.

200
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,190
I think Five Corners
will be perfect.

201
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,510
Just follow this path,
It is a beautiful lake.

202
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,030
That sounds good.
- Yes, that sounds good, thank you.

203
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,950
That is part of the work.

204
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:00,710
Have a nice time and care to.

205
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,190
Good evening.
- Thank you.

206
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,110
Unbelievable.
- Yes, beautiful.

207
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,550
The Ranger said,
that close to one more.

208
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:42,950
I would have to commit a murder.
- Wait, it's so dark.

209
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,950
Let's wait until tomorrow.

210
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,710
You know what you're doing?

211
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,310
No, you still see it.

212
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:06,030
That was the worst food ever.

213
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,430
You've cooked.
- That's right.

214
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,390
You know what this evening
would make perfect?

215
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,830
'Moonshine'.

216
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,510
We have a pot full of.

217
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,590
In fact ...

218
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:23,470
I have enough
for all the church people.

219
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,070
Of Charleston?
- Yes, our new residence.

220
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,830
I begin with you.
You want what?

221
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,950
What do you want?

222
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,110
I want sex with you.

223
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:48,590
That's not really Christian.
- I am for the Old Testament.

224
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,190
And ...

225
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,670
what does that mean?

226
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,070
I have no idea

227
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,070
but I think that the worst is
of the two books.

228
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:19,070
I liked it,
what that woman said about us.

229
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,990
What they said about us?

230
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,790
They thought that we were married.

231
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,110
You are stubborn.

232
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:33,910
I would not really his girlfriend,
I do not occasionally would tease.

233
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,590
Yes, every time you do,

234
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,790
I feel the bad.

235
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,030
I feel than balls.

236
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,150
Sorry, that was not me.

237
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,310
Where are you going?

238
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,590
The fire part.

239
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,790
Damn.

240
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:22,830
Why is he so angry.

241
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,590
What is it?

242
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,630
Where is she?

243
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,750
Calm down, man.

244
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,110
Where is she?
- Who? What are you talking about?

245
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,230
What did you do to her?
- I have done nothing.

246
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:48,270
Where is she?
- Are you deaf, I do not know.

247
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,070
You killed her towel
Where is she?

248
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,270
I have found a towel.
- What?

249
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,390
I have found a towel.
- You found him?

250
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,950
Is that your story?
Stop lying, or I make you.

251
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,150
I can just as well finish.

252
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:07,590
Kill me, I swear.
I found the towel on the path.

253
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,870
I swear.

254
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,910
I thought that you had in you,
city kid.

255
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,550
Too bad you lost your piece.

256
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,590
That is not every day along.

257
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,230
Especially when comrades like you.
- Keep your mouth.

258
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:38,990
You hope that you find her,
before I find her,

259
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:42,110
I will continue its
pleased to address to

260
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,990
and if I'm ready,

261
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,710
cutting her eyes out
and fuck her skull.

262
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:47,910
Asshole.

263
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,670
Where are you?

264
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,630
Help.

265
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,830
Michael, can you hear me?

266
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,270
Look who's awake.

267
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,590
Where am I?

268
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,150
In my house, Michael.

269
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,430
You scared me.

270
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,270
I thought that I had lost you.

271
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:42,310
This clip has fortunately not broken your bone.
You have a severe bruising.

272
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:47,030
This will not comfort you now,
but believe me, that's a good thing.

273
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,270
Excuse me.

274
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:55,870
This old terminal is a source of infection,
so we have to wound cleaning, right?

275
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,990
We will use the evening primrose.

276
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,510
It used the Indians
once.

277
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:11,310
To ... for everything to heal.

278
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,230
I use it so well.

279
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,950
Try to relax.

280
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,270
Thank you.

281
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,110
Thank you for your help.

282
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,950
You do not thank me.

283
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:30,510
We are here for each other,
the only way we can survive.

284
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:36,030
Sorry, but I know your name.

285
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:39,670
Earth,
what am I a bad score geefster,

286
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,710
my name is lda.
lda Forester.

287
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,950
I need your help.

288
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,110
I work as fast as I can, sweetheart.

289
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,470
It is not about me,
but my girlfriend, Sheryl.

290
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,910
You've met her yesterday.

291
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,750
I think it is something.

292
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,910
I woke up and she was gone.
I've searched but I could not find her.

293
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,910
We need someone to call the Rangers,
we must find her.

294
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,990
Did you phone?

295
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,870
No, excuse me.

296
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,230
I did not need.

297
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:16,150
I have a transmitter,
we can inform the central.

298
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:20,070
Once we are ready with you.
- I 'm fine, please.

299
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,750
Wil you lose your leg?
Because that is the question.

300
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:28,190
If we are ready, okay?
Bite it.

301
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,510
I do not lie.

302
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,950
You'll feel the pain, honey.

303
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,270
It is good.

304
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,590
It is almost ready.

305
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,830
It is over.

306
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,710
Look.

307
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,390
We will primulas to do
then you again as good as new.

308
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:20,950
Ida, please, that station.
The transmitter would transmit a message?

309
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:24,990
Of course, I care for it.

310
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,150
Ida, are you there?

311
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,030
He searches me.

312
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,990
Why?
- I do not know.

313
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,230
It has something to do with the missing
Sheryl of it.

314
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,710
I normally do.

315
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,750
Ida.
- I'll al

316
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,830
What took so long?

317
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,670
What do you, Brody?

318
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,550
I am looking for a tourist.

319
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:04,150
Is he alone?

320
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:07,190
He had a girlfriend with him.
I am looking for him now.

321
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,790
Excuse me,
I have seen no one for days.

322
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,790
Why are you looking for him?

323
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,310
He worked Darryl's face with a rifle.

324
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,270
He left him bleeding behind.

325
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,710
My God.
- He almost killed him.

326
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,270
If you see someone, you do not know
light in me.

327
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,750
Of course.

328
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,590
Well.

329
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,110
He is gone.

330
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,230
Brody and his boys suits.

331
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,150
This cousin of his, it had earned.

332
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,790
What did the Ranger?
Does he talk to me?

333
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,790
Excuse me,
I could reach anyone.

334
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,070
Goddamn.

335
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,350
Please ...

336
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:05,390
abuse the name of God
in this house.

337
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,990
Excuse me.

338
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,510
Drink this.

339
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,830
They are on patrol
and so will be back.

340
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,550
We try again to reach
and then we find Sheryl.

341
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,110
I swear.

342
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:33,390
She is determined to go up
and do not know where she is.

343
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,350
That happens a lot more.

344
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,430
Drink this, Michael.
You will feel better.

345
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,030
Good?

346
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,710
How do you know my name?

347
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,750
Pardon?

348
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,310
You called me Michael.

349
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,230
You said the net.

350
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:57,190
And earlier al
Nobody calls me Michael.

351
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,950
They will have your mistakes.
You should have told me.

352
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,350
I said that I called Mike.

353
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,750
Only my grandmother,

354
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,510
who is dead,
called me Michael.

355
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,190
How would I need to know your name?

356
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:15,310
On my license and credit card,
the name Michael.

357
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,110
If you my wallet
have stolen from the campsite,

358
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,190
would you know.

359
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:25,030
Accuse me of the steal
your wallet?

360
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,870
I saved your life twice.

361
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,990
Why would I steal your wallet?

362
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,950
Drink your primulas.

363
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,830
Where are you going?
- I own the Ranger calls.

364
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,430
I go in that room.

365
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,430
I can not let you.

366
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,190
Where is Sheryl?

367
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,470
She is in there, huh?

368
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,750
You are all sinners right.

369
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,590
I saw your last night,

370
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:02,190
you spuugden God in the face
and its laws,

371
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,350
indulgent to the sins
of meat.

372
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,830
You and your whore girlfriend

373
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,550
will pay for your sins.

374
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,830
Hello?

375
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:02,230
Is everything okay?

376
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,590
I untie you.

377
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,630
Ok.

378
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:08,990
Is everything okay?

379
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:12,910
I must get something
release it to you, okay.

380
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:24,590
He will come back.

381
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:27,350
He will come back.
Who, dear?

382
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,830
Fast.
- Okay.

383
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:32,950
Is it?

384
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:54,350
Sheryl, run away.

385
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,630
Help!

386
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:54,590
What's happening with you?

387
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:58,030
It haunts me ...
- Calm down.

388
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,470
He haunts me.

389
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:03,030
I can not rope to tie.
Who follows you?

390
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:06,590
There is no one, check it out.

391
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,870
Behind you is none
see you.

392
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:11,150
You see, there is none.

393
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,950
Calm down.
Everything is good.

394
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:16,710
Everything is good.

395
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,430
Everything is good.

396
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,550
What is wrong?

397
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,990
How can you let her escape,
Deacon?

398
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:40,390
If you want something
well done,

399
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:41,910
you must do.

400
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:03,670
So.

401
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:05,670
Perfect.

402
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:07,990
So beautiful as a summer day.

403
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,110
It's almost time.

404
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:50,310
In his letter to the Korintiлrs
Apostle Paul writes,

405
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:52,750
'Because there is so much immorality,

406
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:56,070
every man,
his wife have

407
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:58,430
and every woman,
her own husband.

408
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:02,710
The man will be marital obligations
meet women

409
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,990
and other women in the male. "

410
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:09,550
In the presence of our Lord
Jesus Christ

411
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,910
I ask you, Mike and Sheryl,

412
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:14,630
you accept the holy band
of marriage?

413
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:24,790
I ask again.

414
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,750
You accept the sacred band,
of marriage?

415
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,710
By the power entrusted to me,
I declare you husband and wife.

416
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:40,990
Why are you doing this?

417
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,110
We have you done nothing.

418
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:46,870
You may now kiss the bride.

419
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:52,310
You bastards are sick.

420
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:56,390
Skip never another language,
in this house.

421
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:59,910
Now kiss the bride,
he cut her lips off.

422
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:09,990
I love you.

423
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:29,430
Let her go.

424
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:32,830
Let her go, damn it.

425
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,110
lda, wait.

426
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:38,230
Please, do not.

427
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,670
Whatever you want

428
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:42,510
I will give you.

429
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:45,190
I know.

430
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,110
Okay, mister.

431
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:25,150
There is a chair behind you.

432
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,310
Sit down.

433
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,390
I get the mustache out of your mouth

434
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:33,190
and then we talk
of man to man.

435
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:35,950
Please, let us go.

436
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:37,590
It's not too late.

437
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:39,950
We will tell it to anyone.

438
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:45,470
How well do you know the Bible, Michael?
- Jesus, God damn it.

439
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:50,790
I said you had
careful with that language.

440
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,270
Get the clothes.

441
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:01,430
Have you enough?

442
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:08,550
Okay.

443
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:10,510
I ask again.

444
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:12,430
How well do you know the Bible?

445
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:18,790
Not very good.

446
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,470
I want you, Deacon.

447
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:37,790
I want you to fuck me,

448
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:39,470
hard.

449
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,910
I will tell you a story,
about Judas.

450
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:52,230
Judas was one of Jesus's disciples.

451
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:57,470
But he led the Romans
to the particular prison and death,

452
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:59,710
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

453
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,670
Supposedly he
now next to the Devil,

454
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:06,310
with forever in hell burning soul,
because of this sin.

455
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:09,950
But I have my own theory.

456
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:12,470
The death of Jesus was predicted,

457
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:15,550
thousands of years,
Judas before even existed.

458
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:18,590
And to the prediction
to emerge,

459
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:21,150
Jesus had to die.

460
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,630
I can not believe

461
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:26,630
that Judas wanted,
you do?

462
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:28,110
Not me.

463
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,510
Someone had to do it.

464
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:34,070
And Judas helped Jesus.

465
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:38,470
He helped him to die for us,
our souls to save.

466
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:41,830
And I believe,
that Judas is in heaven,

467
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:43,590
despite his sin.

468
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:47,470
Because he did what God wanted.

469
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:14,270
Deacon, go to her.

470
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,350
Forward, out of here, go.

471
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:24,710
That I'm sorry, honey.

472
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:27,590
My brother is not healthy.

473
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:35,230
This is not only his fault.

474
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:38,230
My father was a good
Christ in him.

475
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:41,670
And when that terrible accident
and all those scars.

476
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:43,790
The loss of his voice.

477
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,550
I have spoken with him

478
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,470
and others is over,
will not happen to you.

479
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:53,270
He promised me.

480
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:56,190
Son,

481
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:58,390
you're in trouble.

482
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:03,630
You and Sheryl are sinners,
in the eyes of the Lord.

483
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:06,990
Relationships, marriage,
are sinful.

484
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:11,550
And you are damned souls,
to forever burn in hell.

485
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:13,670
But me and Ida,

486
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:16,150
give you an opportunity,

487
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:19,590
to save your souls
and correct life.

488
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:22,110
But you will need to maintain

489
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:25,830
and the strength and determination
your character must show

490
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:28,550
but that you will succeed.

491
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,230
Because that that is what must be done.

492
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,110
I get it from your mouth

493
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:40,510
and we will give you some tea.

494
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,510
There is in primulas.

495
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:45,430
This helps you relax
and rest, okay?

496
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,630
Please, do not.

497
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:49,990
Let us go,
let us go home.

498
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:52,270
Drink the tea.

499
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:03,230
That's better.
Good girl.

500
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:07,590
I almost forgot
to call

501
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:09,590
how does it feel to be married?

502
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:12,230
Why are you doing this?

503
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:15,630
I thought that you would be happy.

504
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:20,550
Everything I wanted in my life,
was married and a baby.

505
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:23,310
The Lord blessed me with Clyde,

506
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:27,750
but the children is a problem.

507
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:34,830
She soon becomes pregnant,
but they do not get the end.

508
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:39,430
Timothy was the hardest.

509
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:41,990
He took the eighth Monday

510
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:48,670
This city had some strange doctor
ideas about his condition.

511
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,310
It always breaks my heart.

512
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:55,270
That woman is a born mother.

513
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:00,110
What exactly do you want from us?

514
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,070
Listen.

515
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:12,350
You are young and strong.

516
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:15,310
Unlike me.

517
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:18,950
For you will be easier.
- What?

518
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:20,990
What would be easier?

519
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,070
You'll get a baby.

520
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,310
My baby.

521
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,670
Honey?

522
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:53,590
What did you do to her?

523
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:56,230
They will have a few hours sleep,
but she is okay.

524
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,590
Here you have some water.

525
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:04,110
lda is in a few hours back
and checks to see whether you have done.

526
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:05,350
If that is not the case,

527
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:08,670
will your little girl, if you see her,
part missing

528
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:11,110
set us on the test.

529
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:13,510
View it.

530
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:17,590
We know that something is not.

531
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:20,110
Try not to feel pressure.

532
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:23,030
We are ready to go
as long as it lasts.

533
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:27,350
Just do your best every time
and the miracle take place.

534
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:31,870
Are you really crazy?

535
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:44,070
What was I talking about that language?

536
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:50,950
Deacon will be outside,
for the door.

537
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:53,470
This is the only door
there are no windows.

538
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:55,510
This room is
six feet under the ground.

539
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:58,550
You can scream so hoarse,
but nobody will hear you.

540
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:06,190
Well, we'll let you come alone.

541
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:09,990
I was almost forgotten.

542
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:28,350
Will this time be?
- Yes.

543
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:29,750
Promise me that, Clyde?

544
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:32,750
Promise.
- I promise.

545
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:41,430
Sheryl, honey, wake up.

546
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:44,310
Sheryl, come.

547
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:24,630
I was not clear yesterday?

548
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:26,750
No, I ...

549
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:29,030
Did you know what you expected?

550
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:30,750
Yes, but how do you expect ...

551
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:32,870
You have clearly not understood.

552
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:35,870
You have not even tried.

553
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:38,310
What you ask us, is insane.

554
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:39,790
You guys are sick.

555
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:42,710
Yes, when sex was a sin,
it was okay,

556
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:45,030
but now she is your wife,
it is sick?

557
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:46,550
Unbelievable.

558
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,030
I had warned you.

559
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:04,670
Where is Mike?

560
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:09,910
What do you do with him?

561
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:14,110
Make sure you prefer,
about what will happen to you.

562
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:27,470
What are you doing?

563
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:33,830
You do not have to do.

564
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:37,510
Please.

565
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:41,470
Wait.

566
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:56,590
You think a lot smarter than me to be, huh?

567
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,230
No.
- It is true.

568
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:04,230
With your excellent schools
and nice jobs and stuff.

569
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,870
I see it in your eyes, honey.

570
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:10,950
You will be surprised
but I was an excellent student.

571
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:13,030
Always tienen.

572
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:17,350
Except for science
and all that nonsense about Darwin.

573
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:20,270
I had a teacher, Mr. Billings.

574
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:22,630
He told us that in the future,

575
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:26,830
people will be born,
without the influence of evolution.

576
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:31,150
I ontstak in anger,
explanation on how they gave,

577
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:33,110
the creations of God.

578
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:35,070
"No, sir," I said to him.

579
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:37,870
"I am a descendant
of Heavenly Father

580
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:40,230
and not some dirty ape. "

581
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:45,510
I think Mr. Billings
and Mr. Darwin will be welcomed,

582
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:51,110
because you girl, will evolve.

583
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:03,750
Wait, wait.

584
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:06,070
You need not to do this.

585
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:24,870
Stop please.
Okay, enough.

586
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:30,510
lda, please, do not.

587
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:35,310
Do you think that I great job as you,
pain would like to do?

588
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:37,350
However, if you and your husband
not obey,

589
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:39,710
my hands are tied.

590
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:43,630
I get it, Ida.
You can not do.

591
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:46,790
There are many women that a baby
can not express.

592
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:49,390
I understand your pain.

593
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:52,910
You know nothing of me,

594
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:55,430
or what I witnessed.

595
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:06,710
Wait.

596
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:12,510
I am on your side.

597
01:03:13,350 --> 01:03:15,230
Let me help you.

598
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:17,670
Please, let me help you.

599
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:28,350
You are helped by the rules.

600
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:45,430
Clyde.
- Good morning, Brody.

601
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:50,870
I was last in your house.

602
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:52,670
Ida said that al

603
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:57,590
Have you seen or heard something,
about those tourists?

604
01:03:58,390 --> 01:04:02,870
Yes, now you say,
I saw him and his girlfriend go.

605
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:06,270
And when was that?

606
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:09,790
Yesterday evening,
at dusk, I thought.

607
01:04:09,870 --> 01:04:11,270
Nonsense.

608
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,150
You may believe what you want.

609
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:17,630
I saw their car still in the parking lot,
last night.

610
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:20,110
They left not just before dusk.

611
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:23,510
Maybe this morning then
the car is now no more.

612
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:27,870
We feel something not good.
With you and lda ...

613
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:29,630
I have no time.

614
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:33,230
Let my arm loose, Brody.

615
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:37,750
What do you know that tourists,
you tell me?

616
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:41,590
I said a moment ago, I saw them leave.

617
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:44,270
Let it go.

618
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:07,910
How do you think I should do?

619
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:11,870
Wil you some extra motivation for us?

620
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:17,270
You do not want to, you have lovely bride
suffering through a day like today?

621
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:18,910
You will not get away.

622
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:20,710
We have friends, family,

623
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:23,710
they will come looking for us,
they know where we are, they find us.

624
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:25,670
Perhaps ...

625
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:28,710
but your car will not be found.

626
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:51,350
Are they gone?

627
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:53,270
What?

628
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,190
Yes, they are gone.

629
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:57,990
This mess is
me huge bang.

630
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,910
Everything is good.
- My God, Mike.

631
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:14,270
What have they to you?
- I'm okay.

632
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,190
You're not okay,
we are not okay.

633
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:21,670
What should we do?

634
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:24,230
I do not know.

635
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:27,550
Maybe we should do
what they want.

636
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:29,070
What?

637
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:30,990
If they stop,
you things to do ...

638
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:33,350
No certainly not.

639
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:39,950
Remember, once you are pregnant,
they murder me.

640
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:42,430
And if you like, you

641
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:44,670
they will murder you too.

642
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:50,190
Reasons enough for them
no child to give.

643
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:55,230
I do not talk about sin,
I am so sinful as pie.

644
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:03,470
I get us here,
I promise you.

645
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:06,790
Well.

646
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:19,750
Goei Demo gene, Sam.

647
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:23,510
Today is no different as different,
So, wipe that smile off your face.

648
01:07:24,830 --> 01:07:28,390
Sam, do you remember that couple in Virginia still,
that arrived here Friday?

649
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,910
Friday?
Yes, when there was a set to

650
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:33,070
but they told not
where they came from.

651
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:35,470
The mother of that girl
this morning has been three times,

652
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:38,190
she says that she no longer
her daughter has heard.

653
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:40,830
She is yesterday and today
nor her work published.

654
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:47,990
They certainly knew that she wanted to park?
- Yes, she has a reward be offered.

655
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:49,590
Damn.

656
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:52,550
Make sure what photos get faxed,
I lies in the patrols.

657
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:08,430
It is time.

658
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:20,070
You do not have to look.
There is nothing happening.

659
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:25,710
Michael, I appreciate your honesty,

660
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:28,350
I understand you
particular situation.

661
01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:32,190
But this punishment will have to follow.

662
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:34,710
Clyde, Evelyn here, please reply.

663
01:08:42,190 --> 01:08:43,510
Say it ...
- Help.

664
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,030
Get him outta here.

665
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:51,430
We sit down here.

666
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:52,550
Make sure he keeps his mouth.

667
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:54,590
... photos received.

668
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:57,550
If you can, get there a few
and check the environment, okay?

669
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:04,390
Clyde, did you hear that?

670
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:07,670
I've heard.

671
01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:22,790
Stop the drugs away.

672
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:31,790
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

673
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:34,790
Evelyn, dear.

674
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:37,110
When you start something with me?

675
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:40,230
With such a remark,
will never be.

676
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:43,990
You are nothing,
than a cold forceps.

677
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:48,550
I was wondering whether you guys a few walkers
have seen the last days?

678
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:50,190
What is this about?

679
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:59,190
Is that missing?
- That seems to be the case.

680
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:01,350
Why, have you seen them?

681
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:05,910
Have you already talked about Clyde?
- All Rangers are searching.

682
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:08,150
The family praises a reward.

683
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:09,950
How much?

684
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:13,070
I do not know exactly
I think a reasonable amount.

685
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:18,510
Lonnie and I will look at them.

686
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:20,550
We do what we can,
to help.

687
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:24,150
Hey, if you change your mind,

688
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:26,510
I will give you a rough ride.

689
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:29,230
Get out, pervert.

690
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:32,670
Lonnie in the car.

691
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:25,990
We are not violent people.

692
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:28,470
It gives us pain, to hurt you.

693
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:33,870
I know it yet, which Deacon,
there seems to kick.

694
01:12:34,510 --> 01:12:37,510
Look, I mean it now.

695
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:40,590
The disobedience,
the curse.

696
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:42,990
The sooner you give us
what we want

697
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:45,710
the less you will
and your wife something.

698
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:50,990
So if I see it,
did you find us alive.

699
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:53,030
You need us, point.

700
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:55,630
The park staff
and the police looking for us,

701
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:59,390
you panicked.
Your whole plan is in tatters.

702
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:01,070
So stop with that
sucks rod in fire prod,

703
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,350
to make me afraid,
because it does you.

704
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:08,710
You are just a bunch
fucking sick freaks.

705
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:55,590
What was that?

706
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:07,470
Get off her.

707
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:10,030
Go there.
- What have you done?

708
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:11,950
What did you do to her?

709
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:33,030
Okay, it starts from the hand.

710
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:36,390
The longer your business slows down,

711
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:38,750
the more risk
that something happens.

712
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:45,710
Deacon I just turned away.

713
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:48,110
He knows,
that he has done something wrong.

714
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:52,070
Everything you need to do
your marital obligations to fulfill

715
01:14:52,230 --> 01:14:53,990
than I love him from the neighborhood.

716
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,390
Do you think God wants
you have children?

717
01:14:57,990 --> 01:15:00,230
Kill them so maybe hell,
for their birth?

718
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:03,590
Because you a couple fucking monsters,
not baby deserve?

719
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:08,110
Take that back.

720
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:18,270
Torture me,
do what you fucking want.

721
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:21,550
I will you never give a child.

722
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:27,150
What brave.

723
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:31,510
Well.

724
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:33,990
I will not torture you.

725
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:38,550
I torture her.

726
01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:42,790
Deacon I can recall.

727
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:44,790
Him going to go.

728
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:48,870
There are more holes,
where you do not baby it is.

729
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:52,430
Or perhaps we shall trimming.

730
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:56,750
Everything we need is the brains,
the heart and uterus.

731
01:15:58,670 --> 01:16:00,990
She has no fingers needed.

732
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:05,350
She has toes not required.

733
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:11,590
She has no need nose.

734
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:13,190
Whether the ears.

735
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:15,150
I can cut her eye.

736
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:18,750
So, you give me my baby?

737
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:22,030
My child?
Born from the marriage?

738
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:24,550
Saved from his sinful income parents.

739
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:28,030
Raised in the fear of God
and his name panegyrical.

740
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:38,910
So there you have us for?

741
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:42,430
For a baby to get
born from a marriage?

742
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:46,150
I'll tell a damn joke,
I'm already pregnant.

743
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:48,390
Eight weeks, since yesterday.

744
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:55,270
I tried a good time to find
to tell.

745
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:09,870
No, it can not.

746
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:18,870
Gently.

747
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:24,790
It's locked, we disappear.

748
01:17:24,910 --> 01:17:27,110
I turn in a window.
- Save you a window in?

749
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:38,310
We can not go inside.

750
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:40,070
If you do not want to go
then not.

751
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:43,150
Then not.
Go to the lookout.

752
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:45,910
Lijster shit.

753
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:02,350
What are you doing?

754
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:19,550
He lult from his neck.

755
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:23,070
I turn him on his beak.
Asshole.

756
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:19,110
What the hell?

757
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:35,470
Help, we are here.
Help.

758
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:15,470
Ida, you know, what needs to be done.

759
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:18,470
Clyde no, I get her an abortion.

760
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:22,310
We can do her pregnant
leave and everything is good.

761
01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:24,030
Abortion?

762
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:26,830
No, we do not.

763
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:29,670
It is no sin,
a devil to abort.

764
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:34,510
There is a poster on the wall, Ida.
Michael is right.

765
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:38,790
Now that a reward is awarded, believe you,
that Lonnie and Brody are the only ones?

766
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:42,470
There will be many people searching.

767
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:47,150
We must do so,
that they never found.

768
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:52,710
We find another pair.
- Not again, no.

769
01:20:52,870 --> 01:20:55,110
Excuse me.
It's too dangerous.

770
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:58,510
We find a different pair.
A better pair.

771
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:00,590
It is not fair

772
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:06,670
lda ...

773
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:12,190
I go inside
and do what needs to be done.

774
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:47,830
Mike, you're right.
They search you.

775
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:51,350
But they will not find you.

776
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:13,150
Believe me, Clyde, I understand the
particular situation,

777
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:16,710
but there is a criminal
be distributed.

778
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:25,270
One down.

779
01:22:42,950 --> 01:22:44,390
What is it?

780
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:46,230
There is no ammo.

781
01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:12,430
No, God.

782
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:25,390
Burn in hell, Michael.

783
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:28,550
I tried to save your soul,
I tried to save you.

784
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:33,230
And what do I thank?
You kill my Clyde.

785
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:37,270
I send hand to hell.

786
01:23:49,510 --> 01:23:51,590
Damn, I save it.

787
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:59,030
The walkietalkie of Clyde,
search him

788
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:02,030
and call the Rangers Post.

789
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:08,830

796
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:52,350
Rangers Post.
Are you still there?

797
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:22,710
Honey.

798
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:26,110

805
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:58,830
