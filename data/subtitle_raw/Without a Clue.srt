1
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,551
I told ya.

2
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:58,558
A quick tunnel job and up the stairs,
as pretty as you please.

3
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,987
That's worth over 10,000 Pounds.

4
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,282
- We're going to be rich
- Not this time, gentlemen.

5
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,619
Sherlock Holmes!

6
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,541
Watson?

7
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,420
Right you are, Holmes.

8
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:32,592
Run, Archie. Run or we'll swing for it!

9
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:37,472
Don't let those ruffians escape.

10
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,777
I am inspector Lestrade.
You are under...

11
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:58,743
There's no escape, my friend.

12
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:13,508
This will be a pleasure.

13
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,475
- Well done, Watson.
- Are you all right, Holmes?

14
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:27,647
Quite, which is more than I can say
for John Clay,

15
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,443
one of London's least notorious thieves.

16
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:35,655
inspector, I have your man.

17
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,660
Come on, sonny.

18
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,997
Well, Mr. Holmes...

19
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,458
..I don't know how, but
you've done it again.

20
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,377
Thank you, inspector.
That's high praise indeed,

21
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:54,341
coming from such a
workmanlike detective.

22
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:59,220
And now, if you have
nothing further to add,

23
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:04,142
I hereby declare this case...closed.

24
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:08,188
Good We've got kippers for breakfast

25
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,358
Just a minute.

26
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,287
- You idiot!
- What?

27
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,790
Confound you!

28
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,042
What did I...? What did
I...? What did I say?

29
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,169
Watson, what did I say wrong?

30
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:37,217
I did everything you said,
exactly as you said it.

31
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,679
All right, what did I do?

32
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,141
You're not going to tell me, are you?

33
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,061
All right. You want
to know what's wrong?

34
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,564
- Well, I said I did, didn't I?
- I'll tell you what's wrong.

35
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,859
- Don't declare a case is closed...
- Just a minute, Watson.

36
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,070
- My public awaits.
- until I say...

37
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,280
..it's closed.

38
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:26,409
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Morning, Mr. Holmes.

39
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,245
Sir, how did you know
somebody was tunneling

40
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,039
into the Royal Gallery?

41
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,751
That was very interesting.
There was fresh dirt in the building next door.

42
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,962
Um, fresh dirt...

43
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,132
Would you like to
elaborate on that, sir?

44
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,844
It was an elementary deduction
based on the clues at hand.

45
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,681
But didn't Scotland Yard
see the very same clues?

46
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:53,812
- I see AND observe.
- Isn’t that rather redundant?

47
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,196
Describe the front of this building.

48
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:06,825
Without looking
describe the front of this house

49
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,537
- Well, it's brick.
- Yes.

50
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,790
- It's got...black railings, I think.
- That's right.

51
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:17,002
And... And windows.

52
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,129
How many windows?

53
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,881
How many?

54
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,092
I don't know.

55
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:28,013
Quite so. He sees, but
he does not observe,

56
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:33,893
whereas I see AND observe and thus
bring many notorious blackguards to justice.

57
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,230
Hear, hear, sir!

58
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,695
Did I put that reporter in his place?

59
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,823
Just for the record...

60
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,701
..how many windows are there
in the front of this building?

61
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:53,997
I haven't the foggiest idea.

62
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,876
There are fifteen windows, you fool!

63
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,044
Fifteen!

64
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,421
Yes.

65
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,592
Not only that...

66
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:10,013
Not only that,
but the reporter you just embarrassed,

67
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,140
he knows how to type.

68
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:17,771
He's somewhat near-sighted
and recently returned from a holiday.

69
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,898
And how do you know that, Watson?

70
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,567
Elementary. From the
creases on his wrists

71
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,529
- where a typist presses against the table.
- Watson, do you think

72
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:30,575
this is a good likeness of me?

73
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,996
Wonderful story, by the way,
but on page two you have me

74
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,416
- admitting a mistake.
- A writer must write of which he knows.

75
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,544
Oh, do you think that's
really necessary?

76
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:45,090
I mean, tarnishing the
image, and all that.

77
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,217
Hello!

78
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,843
What have we here?

79
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,305
Something's afoot.

80
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,904
How many times have I told you
to stay away from my experiments?

81
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,241
Something wrong?

82
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,789
I seem to spend an increasing amount
of my precious time

83
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,959
correcting your blunders,
both private and public.

84
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,504
Oh, I see. It’s the Clay case.

85
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,799
Are you still in a snit over that?

86
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:32,637
- if you want my opinion...
- I beg your pardon? Opinion, did you say?

87
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,057
Oh, my God. Not that speech again.

88
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,852
May I remind you, for
your information, sir,

89
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:43,481
- that your opinions are my opinions.
- Oh piffle!

90
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,109
I created the character
of Sherlock Holmes,

91
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:50,655
and hired you merely to play the part,
snatching you, as it were, from the gutter.

92
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,825
Hardly the gutter, old boy.

93
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,912
- After all, I was once an actor of note.
- Whose last play, I believe,

94
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,583
ran a total of one half
of one performance.

95
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:07,005
I'll have you know,
Shadow Of Death with Reginald Kincaid

96
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,966
was a towering work
decades ahead of its time.

97
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:13,219
Lesson Number Two -
Advanced Bowing

98
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,682
My only regret was that it ended
before the climactic third-act duel.

99
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:21,269
Too bad you didn't have
a chance to see it.

100
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,689
I've no use for theatrical swordplay.

101
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,567
All I ask is that you
obey a few simple rules.

102
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,903
Not the least of which
is a case is not closed

103
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,821
until I say it's closed.

104
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:36,326
I think you underestimate
my own native deductive abilities.

105
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,453
Listen. You hear those footsteps?

106
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:44,084
I'd say this was a woman about 5' 5",
weighed about 12 1/2 stone, age 54.

107
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,586
Voila.

108
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,218
Blown yourseif up again?

109
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,221
Watson, it's for you -
your Baker Street Irregulars.

110
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,972
Hello, boys.

111
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,768
Wiggins, give it back.

112
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:10,068
Just trying to earn a living.
We heard you was looking for us, Doctor.

113
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:17,492
Yes, boys. There's been some trouble
concerning the break-in at the Royal Gallery.

114
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:21,746
What? We heard that er...Mr. Holmes
declared the case closed.

115
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,415
All right, all right.

116
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:28,253
That will prove, after some creative writing,
to be merely a ruse on Mr. Holmes's part.

117
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:32,048
No, something's not right.
John Clay does not deal in works of art.

118
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,175
I need you boys to have a look around.

119
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,761
Eyes sharp, ears quick.
A copper for your trouble,

120
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,722
and a shilling for what you learn.

121
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,266
We'll do our best won't we lads?
- Yeah

122
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,685
Don't let us keep you, boys.
Come on, out!

123
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:45,687
Don't worry about a thing, Doctor.

124
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:49,733
We know how much
you could use some real assistance.

125
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:55,697
There you are. You're making
a laughing stock of me. How can I be...

126
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:58,366
How can I be expected to
maintain a character,

127
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,994
when you belittle me
in front of those hooligans?

128
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:04,956
Character? Are we talking of the same man
who once declared with total conviction

129
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:08,752
that the late Colonel Howard had been
bludgeoned to death by a blunt "excrement"?

130
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:12,172
is it my fault
if you have such poor handwriting?

131
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,466
Anyway, it was just a little mistake.

132
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:18,303
- He's been at it again.
- I never liked that woman.

133
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:21,556
Come in, Mrs. Hudson.

134
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:27,645
- I found it under a loose board in the stairwell.
- Thank you, Mrs Hudson.

135
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:32,025
An occasional libation enables me
to stiffen my resolve.

136
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,277
Your resolve should be pickled by now.

137
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,697
I don't believe that either of you realise
what pressure I'm under.

138
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,116
Do you know what it's like
to commit to memory

139
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:45,455
a never-ending list of clues and deductions
to be parroted back to Lestrade and reporters?

140
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:50,835
Bloodstains on a toothpick, cigar ash,
new soil in the garden next door.

141
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,671
Endless twaddle!

142
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,758
Twaddle? Are you referring
to the systematic gathering of evidence

143
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,302
and the logical
deductions based thereon?

144
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,180
I am referring to twaddle!

145
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:08,853
And you would be well served to include fewer
of these dreary details in future chronicles,

146
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,231
and place greater emphasis on me.

147
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:17,654
I am, after all, the one
the public really cares about.

148
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:23,326
Would you be so kind
as to excuse us for a moment?

149
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,745
Careful Watson Careful

150
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,289
Remember your blood pressure.

151
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:33,753
And good riddance
to bad rubbish I must say

152
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,382
Am I to understand
that you are giving me notice?

153
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:44,848
Let's just say that the curtain has come down
on yet another miserable performance.

154
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,726
Right. Watson...

155
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:53,189
..I was once a figment
of your imagination.

156
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:59,904
But now Sherlock Holmes
belongs to the whole world.

157
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:10,957
At last we're free of that ungrateful baggage,
eh, Mrs. Hudson?

158
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:17,172
From now on, things are going to be
much more pleasant around here.

159
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,008
An actor?!

160
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,428
Nothing the matter. Nothing at all.

161
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,596
Back to work.

162
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,097
Hold my...

163
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,267
Hold my calls.

164
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:36,441
We'll start at the beginning...

165
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,068
..shall we?

166
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,195
It was about nine years ago.

167
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:45,033
One of my patients was a Scotland Yard
inspector investigating the Paxton murder.

168
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,369
I gave him the name of the murderer,

169
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,705
but gave credit to a
nonexistent detective.

170
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:55,627
At the time, I was hoping
for an appointment to the staff

171
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,004
of a rather conservative
medical college.

172
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,799
I knew that they'd
frown on my little er...

173
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,218
- Hobby?
- Exactly.

174
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,345
Well, I didn't get the appointment.

175
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:10,433
Instead, what I got was a quite unanticipated
public demand to meet this Sherlock Holmes.

176
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:15,230
So you hired this Reginald Kincaid?

177
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,981
He was an actor.

178
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:21,695
Unfortunately, he was also a gambler,
a womaniser and a drunkard.

179
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:25,532
John, you have jeopardised
the integrity of English literature.

180
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,660
Still, I should have known.

181
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:32,706
He was always borrowing
large sums of money off me and...

182
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,833
..never paying me back.
- The cad.

183
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,086
Oh, don't worry.
We deducted it from your royalties.

184
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,047
Now, tell me, who else knows of this?

185
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,425
No-one.

186
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,052
Except Mrs. Hudson and the Irregulars.

187
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:49,097
But it's time now for the public
to learn the truth.

188
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,682
The truth?

189
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,518
Certainly.

190
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,148
No-one will want to read of that twit again.
His popularity will plummet.

191
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,943
- They'll be desperate for my new creation.
- What new creation?

192
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,696
John Watson, the Crime Doctor.

193
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:08,658
I could have it ready
for your very next issue.

194
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,911
Sit down, John.

195
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:19,252
John, erm...people buy
The Strand Magazine

196
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:23,256
expecting to read a story
in which Sherlock Holmes solves the case,

197
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:26,259
not the er...Crime Surgeon.

198
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,969
Crime Doctor.

199
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:32,766
Crime doctor, crime surgeon, crime dentist -
who cares, really?

200
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:36,686
Let's face it, Sherlock Holmes
is worth a fortune to the magazine.

201
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,563
You're stuck with him, I'm afraid.

202
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:43,068
Norman, I'll write what I want.
There's nothing you can do.

203
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,278
The devil, there isn't.

204
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,155
Doctor Watson?

205
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:51,117
- Here come out of there You can't go in there!
- What in the world?

206
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,996
- What is this?
- Sorry, Doctor, but we found something.

207
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,123
- Down by the docks.
- Excellent.

208
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:01,461
- Hello, ducks. Do you work here?
- if you'll excuse us, we have work to do.

209
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:06,966
Watson, I'm warning you, it's Sherlock Holmes
or we'll sue you for everything you're worth.

210
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:10,762
And I mean everything.

211
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:16,893
Damn. Anyone seen my watch?

212
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,731
- There it is, Doctor.
- Camden Paper Mill.

213
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,858
Burned about four this morning.

214
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,195
- Same time as the Clay robbery.
- On the button!

215
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:31,408
Good lad! Now we're getting somewhere.
Come on. Let's take a look around.

216
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,827
Went up like a torch, they say.

217
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:39,165
Well, it's full of wood
pulp and paper, you see.

218
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:42,002
I'm sorry, sir. No-one's
allowed in this area.

219
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:45,130
It’s quite all right, I assure you.
I’m Dr John Watson.

220
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,257
Er, nobody's sick here, sir.

221
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:51,469
You...you don't understand.

222
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:55,181
- John Watson.
- The Crime Doctor.

223
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:59,853
- That's right. John Watson, the Crime Doctor.
- Crime Doctor?

224
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,063
Never heard of him

225
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:06,735
Though er...your name
sounds a bit familiar.

226
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:11,072
All right, I'm Dr John Watson,

227
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:14,743
author of The Sherlock Holmes Mysteries.

228
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,870
Sherlock Holmes?

229
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,580
Yes.

230
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,957
THE Sherlock Holmes?

231
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,335
Yes.

232
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:28,465
Me and the wife have read
every one of his stories.

233
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,549
All right

234
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:33,762
- Now, if you'll excuse me.
- I'm sorry, Doctor, I still can't let you in.

235
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,348
Strict orders about
that, I'm afraid, but...

236
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:40,185
Mr. Holmes - did he send you here?

237
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:43,897
He certainly did not!

238
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:49,361
Well, perhaps the next time,
you should check with him first, eh?

239
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:53,073
Save yourself a trip.

240
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,575
You try and fight crime in this city,

241
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,994
and all you hear about
is Sherlock Holmes.

242
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:01,581
"What's he like? When
will you see him next?"

243
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:02,916
Never, that's when.

244
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,376
Never!

245
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,544
Doctor, dear, keep your voice down.

246
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:10,298
- Why should l?
- Because you have visitors

247
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,553
Inspector Lestrade and a Lord Smithwick.

248
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,145
Of the Treasury?

249
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:35,782
Gentlemen won't you come up?

250
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,867
Oh yes thank you very much

251
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:42,914
- So Mr. Holmes is in is he?
- Doctor Watson will see you

252
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:49,045
although he is quite busy
at his scholarly pursuits

253
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,759
Gentlemen.

254
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,432
Good afternoon, inspector.

255
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:04,561
Doctor, this is Lord Smithwick,
Her Majesty's Chancellor of the Exchequer.

256
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,772
- My pleasure, sir.
- His Lordship wishes to see Mr. Holmes.

257
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:11,359
I'm sorry to say he's
not here at the moment.

258
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:14,154
Oh, how disappointing!

259
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:19,034
Sir, I really don't think Mr. Holmes'
involvement in this case is at all necessary.

260
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,618
I quite agree.

261
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,454
You do?

262
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,582
However, the Crime Doctor
is at your disposal.

263
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:29,919
Who the deuce is the Crime Doctor?

264
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:34,049
Mmm, most amusing,
but this is a matter of the gravest urgency.

265
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,968
When do you expect Mr. Holmes?

266
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,846
Not for a while. He's out of town.

267
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:43,016
Good afternoon.

268
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:46,144
Well...too bad.

269
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,855
I'm sure we'll be able
to get along quite well

270
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,815
- without Mr. Holmes.
- Wait!

271
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,151
Today's Friday isn't it?

272
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:56,196
Yes, of course it is. Silly me.

273
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,907
Holmes is supposed to be back tonight.

274
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:04,037
- How fortunate.
- Very well. We shall return at seven tonight.

275
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:06,498
Come along, lnspector.

276
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,208
Till then, gentlemen.

277
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:15,590
- I'm afraid we've made this trip for nothing
- Your Lordship I must ask you

278
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,510
Where did you get that hat?

279
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,970
Where did you get that tile?

280
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:25,392
Isn’t it a nobby one?
It’s just the proper style

281
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:29,771
I would like to have one
just the same as that

282
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:34,484
Where'er I go they shout,
"Hello! Where did you get that hat?"

283
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:38,655
Where did you get that hat?
Where did you get that tile?

284
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:42,909
Good evening. Have you seen Peter Brandy
anywhere? He's disappeared.

285
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,994
- Hello Connie love
- Hello.

286
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:47,288
Ow!

287
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,959
All right!

288
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:54,212
Who did it?

289
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,716
Come on! Which one of you pinched me?

290
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,427
- Pinched, you say?
- That's right.

291
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:04,848
May I be of...some assistance?

292
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:09,978
The name is Holmes. Sherlock Holmes.

293
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:14,274
Constance Payton, sir.
Pleased to meet you.

294
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:15,692
Charmed.

295
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:18,403
Now, let's see.

296
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:22,907
By careful observation
of the patrons of these premises,

297
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:29,831
I have been able to deduce the identity
of the fiend who pinched you.

298
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:33,251
Me! Did it again!

299
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:41,343
- Thank you, my good man.
- Thank you, sir.

300
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,680
I'll make this brief.

301
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:49,392
I'll make this brief.

302
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,728
I'll make this brief.

303
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,272
I need to see some money, Mr. Holmes.

304
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,608
- It’s been five days now.
- See here, my good man.

305
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:02,072
- Go ahead sir It's on me
- Thank you, sir.

306
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,743
- Watson.
- Hello. How are things?

307
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,870
Couldn't be better. Good health.

308
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:11,206
I'll miek this brafe.

309
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,292
I'll make this brief. I
want you to come back.

310
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:18,046
- Like I predicted, you need me.
- I do not need you.

311
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:20,715
Then what are you here for?
I didn't call for you.

312
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:23,093
All right, I need you,
for this one blasted time.

313
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:26,763
One time, and that's all?
You're going to have to do better than that.

314
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,432
Don't push me
You've already run out of money

315
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:33,269
This is because you lack the necessary skills
to gain decent employment.

316
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:37,857
Ah-ha. Wrong, Watson. You see...

317
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:42,362
..I have been honing my ability
of elementary deductions to a razor's edge.

318
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,739
Observe. Excuse me, sir?

319
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:47,409
How are things on the Subcontinent?

320
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,204
- I beg your pardon?
- You are a reporter just back from India?

321
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:55,041
I'm a barrister,
and I've never been to India in my life.

322
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,919
- But you do read The Times?
- Of course.

323
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:00,046
There you have it.

324
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,716
My card.

325
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:09,347
I'll ask you just once more.
Are you coming with me or not?

326
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:12,642
I would rather waltz naked
through the fires of hell.

327
00:23:12,684 --> 00:23:15,478
I can see coming here was a mistake.

328
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,609
Excellent deduction, Watson.
Keep up the good work.

329
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:28,158
Ah, gentlemen! And what can I do for you?
A mystery to be solved?

330
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:32,746
You might say that.
There's a little matter of a gambling debt.

331
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:37,083
And the mystery is
why you ain't paid it.

332
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:41,338
Gentlemen, you are dealing
with Sherlock Holmes.

333
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:44,299
A man of honour and character
beyond reproach.

334
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:50,263
There he is.
That's the bloke who pinched my bum.

335
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:55,393
Pardon me Pardon me

336
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:58,730
Excuse me, love.

337
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,697
Didn't I say seven o'clock?

338
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:10,283
Forgive me for being late, gentlemen.

339
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:13,244
Is Mr. Holmes with you?

340
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:20,335
Ah, well, um...actually, Lord Smithwick,
a short time ago I received a wire from Holmes

341
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:26,966
instructing me to take down the details and
begin the investigation without him, as it were.

342
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,051
What?!

343
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:31,971
Believe it or not,
I am every bit Holmes's equal as a detective.

344
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:33,306
Doctor Watson!

345
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:37,852
I happen to know
that you recently recovered from an illness,

346
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:39,354
that you smoke a pipe,

347
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:42,399
probably rosewood,
and you spent time in China...

348
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,486
- Doctor, this is no time for parlour games.
- I'm not playing parlour games.

349
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:50,198
Doctor, this is a matter
for professionals.

350
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,284
- You've got to help me
- Holmes, you're back.

351
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,120
So good to see you.

352
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:59,040
My, this is a clever disguise!
A drunken lout. lt's very realistic.

353
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:02,002
There's two men.
This woman said I pinched her...

354
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:06,214
She said I pinched her bum.

355
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:19,978
Gentlemen, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

356
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:26,276
Ah, Lestrade.

357
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:30,488
It’s good to see the department's
letting you out at night again.

358
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,781
Lord Smithwick.

359
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:33,908
Trouble at the Exchequer?

360
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,619
Well, to be honest, it...

361
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:39,372
Wait. How did you know?

362
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:43,251
The same way that I can tell
you've recently recovered from an illness,

363
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:46,671
smoke a pipe, probably rosewood,

364
00:25:46,713 --> 00:25:49,090
and have spent some time in...China.

365
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:51,760
Amazing!

366
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:53,887
Thank you.

367
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:58,558
Lord Smithwick, before we start,
perhaps a little sherry?

368
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,643
I wish we could,

369
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:07,359
but the matter which brings me here
involves the fate of the entire Empire.

370
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,486
I see. Perhaps a whisky, then?

371
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:11,863
Perhaps later.

372
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:14,407
Why don't you tell me the details
and omit nothing?

373
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,451
Watson, pay close attention.

374
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,828
- Do you know what these are?
- I do.

375
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,123
- So do l.
- The plates for the Bank of England's ?5 notes.

376
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:24,668
- Undoubtedly.
- Or very good imitations.

377
00:26:24,709 --> 00:26:26,211
- Precisely.
- Exactly.

378
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:31,341
Indeed. Well, now, that's cleared that up.
How about that whisky?

379
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:35,011
- May l?
- Oh, I suppose so.

380
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,096
Er, Inspector...

381
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:41,309
Just two nights ago,
these clever forgeries were exchanged

382
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:43,436
for the genuine plates.

383
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,398
The real plates
are in the hands of some foreign power.

384
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:48,358
Or someone even more treacherous.

385
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,528
The kingdom could find itself awash
in counterfeit notes.

386
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:57,575
And I don't have to tell YOU
what that would mean.

387
00:26:58,201 --> 00:26:59,536
Yes, you do.

388
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:04,666
Oh, er, it would mean, quite simply,
economic ruin for England.

389
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:11,548
Nobody would know which ?5 notes were real
and which weren't.

390
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:15,969
Gentlemen, I accept this case.

391
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:19,806
My fee will be ?500.

392
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:22,642
Payable in ?10 notes.

393
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:27,397
- Good evening.
- Yes, good night.

394
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:31,943
We can all rest a little
easier now, lnspector.

395
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:33,653
- Yes.
- Drive on, my good man.

396
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:36,448
I don't suppose
it would make any difference

397
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:40,410
if I said I have grave
doubts about Mr. Holmes.

398
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:48,209
I must confess, I feel a bit prouder
knowing Sherlock Holmes is British.

399
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:56,092
Do you suppose he took
the case, Professor?

400
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,471
Watson?

401
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:04,517
My dear boy, how could he resist?

402
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,103
This is working out so very well.

403
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:09,856
Drive on.

404
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:32,462
Gentlemen, I am here.

405
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:35,924
Mr. Holmes at last

406
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:39,928
Welcome to Her Majesty's Royal Mint

407
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:44,140
This is one of my
long-time employees, Mr...

408
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:45,975
- Hadlers, sir.
- Oh, Hadlers, yes.

409
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:49,145
Inspector Lestrade was inquiring
about the vaults

410
00:28:49,187 --> 00:28:53,983
It’s my guess that it's an inside job
by someone with a key.

411
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:57,529
YOU have that key, don't you, Hadlers?

412
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,030
Me, sir? No.

413
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:02,867
lnspector, please.
Mr. Holmes will take over now.

414
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:05,286
That's quite all right, Lord Smithwick.

415
00:29:05,328 --> 00:29:08,248
As a matter of fact, Lestrade,
you can be of some help.

416
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:10,375
- Of course.
- Hold my coat.

417
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,795
It’s hot in here.

418
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,676
So this is where the
printing plates are kept?

419
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:21,052
Er, yes, sir.

420
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:25,348
Yes. Very interesting ind...

421
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:33,356
No harm done.

422
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:37,902
Tell me, how many people
have access to this vault?

423
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:42,741
Three persons only - myself,
the Commissioner for Seals and Engravings,

424
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:45,452
and the Printing Supervisor Peter Giles.

425
00:29:45,493 --> 00:29:48,246
I should like to speak
to this...third person.

426
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:51,958
He didn't turn up for work this morning,
Your Lordship.

427
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,003
We've already done some checking on Giles,
Your Lordship.

428
00:29:55,045 --> 00:29:58,673
He is a widower with
one child named Lesley.

429
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:05,680
I've seen her once or twice myself, sir.
A very pretty girl...in an unusual sort of way.

430
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:08,892
- Pretty?
- Oh, yes, sir. Quite.

431
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:11,019
Watson, make a note of that.

432
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:15,732
Though Mr. Giles himself
seemed slightly uncomfortable

433
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:18,610
when I complimented
him on her appearance.

434
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:21,279
No no no

435
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:24,908
Surely you can't believe
that Peter Giles was involved?

436
00:30:24,949 --> 00:30:27,577
Why, the man's worked
here for over 30 years.

437
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:31,164
And he was very religious, too.
Wouldn't you say so, er....?

438
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:34,793
Hadlers. Oh, yes, sir.
He was always quoting from the Psalms.

439
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:38,380
The Psalms? One of my favourite books.

440
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:42,092
The Bible, wasn't it?

441
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:46,763
I suppose you'll want to speak
to this Peter Giles, Holmes?

442
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:50,266
Actually, I've never been one
for religious talks myself.

443
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:53,103
On the other hand,
no leads must be overlooked.

444
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:55,397
And you can rest assured, Your Lordship,

445
00:30:55,438 --> 00:31:00,026
we shall be investigating
the daughter as well.

446
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,945
I must be going.

447
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:05,865
Come here!
You ninny! What are you doing over there?

448
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:07,992
Amazing fellow, really.

449
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:11,788
All right, now go. Go!

450
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:17,043
Open this door.

451
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:21,881
Giles, open the door.
lt's Sherlock Holmes.

452
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:27,053
Stand back, Watson. I'll break it down.

453
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:31,349
Whoa, boy!

454
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:36,229
Half a tick, Mr. Holmes.

455
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:43,153
You can't go
walking into someone's residence,

456
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:50,493
poking about their personal possessions,
disturbing their privacy.

457
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:53,329
That's for Scotland Yard.

458
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:56,958
Hello? Anybody home?

459
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:00,211
Giles?

460
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:01,713
Nobody home.

461
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:07,010
- Inspector, you're treading on the mail.
- Sorry. Get those.

462
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:10,180
Nice tidy little place.
Oh, a French postcard.

463
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:13,016
Really? I knew a chap
who collected these once.

464
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:16,519
He had this wonderful one
of two women and a... Oh!

465
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:18,813
It’s just a picture of the Eiffel Tower.

466
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:23,985
- Quite a bit of correspondence there, Doctor.
- I'd say Giles hadn't been home for days.

467
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:28,114
- Anything of interest in that card, Mr. Holmes?
- It says, "Having a gay time here

468
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:30,784
but need a holiday.
Will see you on Monday.

469
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:33,078
L."

470
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:36,081
Now, I wonder who that can be.

471
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:38,833
L. Is that an old
friend? A secret lover?

472
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,252
It’s my guess it's his daughter Lesley.

473
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:46,091
I'll wager you're right, Inspector.

474
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:48,802
That's right. Let him deduce everything.

475
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:52,263
When Lestrade returns,
go about your sleuthing routine.

476
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:55,975
- The full treatment?
- Whatever it takes to keep him occupied.

477
00:32:56,017 --> 00:33:01,314
Well, it would appear
as if Mr. Giles has taken himself a holiday.

478
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:04,859
I expected no less.

479
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:11,032
if you'll allow me.

480
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:24,379
- Very interesting up here Watson
- Excuse me.

481
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:36,433
Yes.

482
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:41,646
My word!

483
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:47,694
Don't touch that!

484
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:52,657
There may be fingerprints.

485
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:55,076
The Book of Psalms.

486
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,203
Ah, as I anticipated.

487
00:33:57,245 --> 00:34:01,875
The Bible.
All starting to fit together rather neatly,

488
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:04,544
I'd say.

489
00:34:10,383 --> 00:34:12,844
Ah-ha!

490
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:17,724
Stay with me Lestrade

491
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:21,686
Investigating crime calls for
the searching out of patterns

492
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:24,064
Now, take the patterns in this carpet.

493
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:26,358
Rosettes,

494
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,610
and what appears to
be cherubs, isn't it?

495
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:32,072
ls that a cherub? Yes, a cherub.

496
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:34,908
Dr Watson.

497
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:36,618
What have you there?

498
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,037
Oh, this.

499
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,581
Er, I... I just found
this in the fireplace.

500
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:44,501
Careful. It might be evidence.

501
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:46,920
Really?

502
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:49,923
E-R-M-E-R-E.

503
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:55,261
What do you make of it?

504
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:58,473
Are you blind, Lestrade?
Tell him, Watson.

505
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:05,313
Correct me if I'm wrong, Holmes,
but this piece of paper is part of a map.

506
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:06,731
A location.

507
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:09,901
- Um...
- Ermere.

508
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:12,946
- Erm Ermere?
- Cashmere

509
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:16,491
- Cashmere
- Ermere

510
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:18,743
Ermere. Ermere.

511
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:21,079
Windermere! Lake Windermere!

512
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:22,580
Brilliant, inspector.

513
00:35:22,622 --> 00:35:26,668
The Lake District is a perfect place to hide.
Nobody goes there this time of year.

514
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,045
We'll just wire up to Windermere

515
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:32,882
and see if Giles has
made his appearance yet.

516
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:35,593
And don't you worry, Mr. Holmes.

517
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:41,057
We'll have this case
wrapped up in no time.

518
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:47,480
Unique, actually. Very creative, Watson.

519
00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:51,067
Something that would never have occurred
to the likes of me.

520
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:58,908
lmagine a Sherlock Holmes adventure
in which Lestrade solves the blooming case!

521
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:04,080
Calm yourself. There's a healthy chunk
of mystery yet to be solved.

522
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:07,167
It's to Windermere for
us, where, I assure you,

523
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:11,129
the game is still afoot.

524
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:29,981
As was his habit, Sherlock Holmes
sat in the railway carriage lost in thought.

525
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:33,985
You can hear the girls declare,
he must be a millionaire

526
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:39,324
You can hear them sigh
and wish to die...

527
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,955
Are you Sherlock Holmes?

528
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:51,086
I am indeed, madam.
Would you like my autograph?

529
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:53,922
You put my old man in jail, you did.

530
00:36:53,963 --> 00:37:00,053
From these moments of quiet,
intense reflection would inevitably spring

531
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:03,056
some new...insight.

532
00:37:03,098 --> 00:37:06,559
Stop it, you silly cow!

533
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:10,188
Go on, then! Scared?

534
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:18,697
Sorry about that, Watson.

535
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:27,038
- What are you doing?
- Thinking.

536
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:31,459
Right. I'm going to think too.

537
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:42,262
What shall we think about, Watson?

538
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:15,253
Mr. Holmes...

539
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:17,422
..allow me to introduce myself.

540
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:24,596
I am the Right Honourable
Gerald Fitzwalter Johnson, Lord Mayor.

541
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:26,806
And this is my daughter

542
00:38:26,848 --> 00:38:28,516
Christabel.

543
00:38:28,558 --> 00:38:30,226
Hello, Mr. Holmes.

544
00:38:30,268 --> 00:38:34,522
We're enthusiastic readers
of your articles in The Strand

545
00:38:34,564 --> 00:38:39,319
My daughter in particular
reads each one several times

546
00:38:39,361 --> 00:38:42,864
Don't even think about it.

547
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:45,241
I believe we have
something for you, sir.

548
00:38:45,283 --> 00:38:49,329
A man matching this Mr. Giles's description
arrived two nights ago.

549
00:38:49,371 --> 00:38:54,042
Ah, this is Andrews,
a dock worker here on the lake.

550
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:57,045
He remembers the man quite well.

551
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:58,463
Andrews, this is Mr. Holmes.

552
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:02,759
Come to our fair community
to investigate a matter of great importance.

553
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:06,888
You may begin, Mr. Holmes.

554
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:14,979
What makes you remember this man
so clearly, Mr. Andrews?

555
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:18,650
I remember this man...

556
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:21,778
- Your hat.
- Oh, aye.

557
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,322
I remember this man so clearly

558
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:26,950
because he was carrying
a brown leather suitcase.

559
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,077
The suitcase was fastened to his wrist

560
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,247
with a pair of silver handcuffs.

561
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:37,002
It was very heavy and he commented
on the weight several times.

562
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:39,129
He asked Donald Ayres...

563
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,256
- A local boatman.
- Oh, aye.

564
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:49,597
..a local boatman, to transport him
across the lake to a cottage he had rented.

565
00:39:56,146 --> 00:40:01,192
- Psst.
- Watson, make a note of that.

566
00:40:11,327 --> 00:40:15,582
I'm sure Holmes would like
to speak to this boatman Donald Ayres.

567
00:40:15,623 --> 00:40:18,084
Yes, indeed.

568
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:21,838
Yes, well, the thing of it is,
no-one has seen the fellow

569
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,966
- or the man with the suitcase.
- You mean they've gone missing?

570
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:30,889
Yes. Well, my theory,
if you'll permit me, Mr. Holmes, is this.

571
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,309
- The storm may have done both of them in.
- They went out in a storm?

572
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:35,435
Watson, please.

573
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:38,438
They went out in a storm?

574
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,193
Yes, the lake can get very rough
at this time of the year.

575
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:46,529
Ah, here we are.

576
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:51,743
Our finest hotel - the Shakespeare Arms.

577
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:57,957
Oh, Mr. Holmes,
we're all so proud to have you here.

578
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:01,628
The Duke's absolutely beside himself.

579
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,754
The Duke?

580
00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:05,507
Er, the D-O-G.

581
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:06,758
The Duke, yes.

582
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,719
Sherlock Holmes and Doctor...

583
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:13,098
- John Watson.
- John Watson.

584
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,891
Now, if you'll just follow me,

585
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:19,979
I'll have your luggage taken upstairs.

586
00:41:21,898 --> 00:41:22,941
Now, then, Dukey.

587
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:28,154
You stay down here
while I take the gentlemen upstairs.

588
00:41:28,196 --> 00:41:31,282
He's taken quite a fancy
to you, Mr. Holmes.

589
00:41:31,324 --> 00:41:36,204
He doesn't like everybody, you know.

590
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:40,250
Fetch.

591
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:43,503
What he likes is the summer...

592
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:47,465
..and all them ramblers.

593
00:41:48,508 --> 00:41:51,177
The King Lear Room, Mr. Holmes.

594
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:54,889
The finest we've got.

595
00:41:58,351 --> 00:42:00,437
Yours is on upstairs, Doctor.

596
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:04,024
Be careful of the carpet.
The mice have been at it.

597
00:42:04,065 --> 00:42:06,568
We call this the Hamlet Room.

598
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:11,698
And it does have a
lovely view of the lake.

599
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,617
Now, if you'll excuse me, Doctor...

600
00:42:14,659 --> 00:42:16,161
Watson.

601
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:22,667
Watson. I'll just go and see
if Mr. Holmes is all right.

602
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:56,993
Watson, would you mind
swapping rooms with me?

603
00:42:57,035 --> 00:42:59,746
I once played King Lear,
and, quite frankly,

604
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:03,375
that room would revive memories
of rotten fruit.

605
00:43:03,416 --> 00:43:09,589
- One room's the same as another to me.
- Thank you.

606
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:15,053
What a dreary place this is.

607
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:18,431
Excuse me,
but you are Sherlock Holmes, aren't you?

608
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:22,852
Well, that depends. Do you have a relative
who was recently sent to prison?

609
00:43:22,894 --> 00:43:25,397
Me? Why, no!

610
00:43:25,438 --> 00:43:27,649
Well, yes, then. I am Sherlock Holmes.

611
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:31,903
Well, we would all consider it an honour
if you'd have a drink with us.

612
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:33,947
A drink?

613
00:43:33,988 --> 00:43:42,372
I was just saying to my good friend
Doctor Watson what a lovely village this is.

614
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:52,549
I'll have a double whisky, please.

615
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:55,135
Just to ward off the
chill of the evening.

616
00:43:55,176 --> 00:44:00,306
A double whisky for Mr. Holmes, please.
A toast to the greatest detective in all the world.

617
00:44:00,348 --> 00:44:02,017
Hear hear!

618
00:44:02,058 --> 00:44:04,436
Thank you, gentlemen. I am touched.

619
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:06,563
I can vouch for that.

620
00:44:06,604 --> 00:44:08,815
You, sir, remind me of
someone I encountered

621
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:11,901
during the curious affair
of the Manchurian mambo.

622
00:44:11,943 --> 00:44:16,906
- Holmes, could I have a word?
- Yes?

623
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,076
I believe that was the Manchurian mamba,
Holmes.

624
00:44:20,118 --> 00:44:22,245
Mamba, mambo - what's the difference?

625
00:44:22,287 --> 00:44:25,290
Very little, other than one
is a deadly poisonous snake

626
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:29,461
and the other
is a rather festive Caribbean dance.

627
00:44:29,502 --> 00:44:32,213
It was a night just like any other,

628
00:44:32,255 --> 00:44:34,341
when someone knocked at the door.

629
00:44:34,382 --> 00:44:40,055
I opened it and there were these Manchurians
doing this rather festive Caribbean dance.

630
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:43,475
Manchurian mambo!

631
00:44:43,933 --> 00:44:46,603
Steady, Watson.

632
00:44:46,644 --> 00:44:49,397
Just get through it one more time,

633
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:52,525
then you're rid of the fellow.

634
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:55,904
What a pleasant thought.

635
00:44:55,945 --> 00:44:59,616
I feel much better. Quite euphoric.

636
00:44:59,657 --> 00:45:04,621
But as the snake struck at me,
I danced out of the way.

637
00:45:04,662 --> 00:45:08,291
And if it hadn't been
for my flawless footwork,

638
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:13,380
I'd be standing here a dead man today.

639
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:16,341
What about another drink, Mr. Holmes?

640
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:19,052
Gentlemen, I have to
be up early tomorrow,

641
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:22,972
and I need all my wits about me.

642
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:26,768
Perhaps just one more.

643
00:45:33,274 --> 00:45:36,945
Holmes, sweet Holmes.

644
00:45:47,872 --> 00:45:53,962
You're not the Hound of the Baskervilles,
you know.

645
00:46:08,143 --> 00:46:09,519
Fresh air.

646
00:46:09,561 --> 00:46:13,064
That's what I need.

647
00:46:22,532 --> 00:46:24,617
That's better.

648
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:27,203
Aaargh!

649
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:39,591
Watson! Help!

650
00:46:39,632 --> 00:46:43,553
Jesus. What now, Holmes?

651
00:46:46,264 --> 00:46:48,683
Help me, Watson!

652
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:51,936
Watson wake up!

653
00:46:56,649 --> 00:46:59,069
Help!

654
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:02,697
For God's sake!

655
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:05,283
Watson!

656
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:08,411
Hang on. I'm coming.

657
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:10,872
- Please help me!
- Hang on

658
00:47:10,914 --> 00:47:14,000
- Here I am.
- Quickly.

659
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:16,211
For heaven's sake. Give me your hand.

660
00:47:16,252 --> 00:47:18,880
- Are you there?
- Yes, I'm here. Hold out your hand.

661
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:20,340
Well done.

662
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:23,510
- Pull quickly. Pull harder.
- I am pulling, old boy.

663
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:25,637
- Pull, pull, pull! That's it.
- Stop it.

664
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:30,642
- Steady on, old boy!
- Don't let go!

665
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:35,105
Jolly good.

666
00:47:38,024 --> 00:47:39,067
Fascinating.

667
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:41,569
This railing appears
to have been cut by someone.

668
00:47:41,611 --> 00:47:44,572
Get him off!

669
00:47:57,335 --> 00:47:59,421
Good morning, gentlemen.

670
00:47:59,462 --> 00:48:01,881
- Morning.
- Morning.

671
00:48:01,923 --> 00:48:05,135
This is the cottage Giles leased
from a company in London.

672
00:48:05,176 --> 00:48:07,053
Allow me to show you the way.

673
00:48:07,095 --> 00:48:10,265
Mr. Mayor, don't move.

674
00:48:10,306 --> 00:48:15,103
Not until Mr. Holmes has had a chance
to inspect the area for clues.

675
00:48:15,145 --> 00:48:18,023
By God, I've trained you well, Watson.

676
00:48:18,064 --> 00:48:21,901
Now, follow me closely.

677
00:48:27,282 --> 00:48:31,995
- What am I looking for?
- Footprints.

678
00:48:32,037 --> 00:48:33,705
Right.

679
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:37,250
- Have I found any yet?
- No, not yet.

680
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:41,629
Right. Let me know when I do.

681
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:53,475
Hello? Anyone at home?

682
00:48:56,394 --> 00:48:58,855
Hello?

683
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:06,821
Well, if Giles was headed here,

684
00:49:06,863 --> 00:49:09,699
it's obvious he never arrived.

685
00:49:09,741 --> 00:49:12,452
Mr. Holmes.

686
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:15,622
They've found...Donald Ayres.

687
00:49:15,663 --> 00:49:17,999
Who?

688
00:49:23,546 --> 00:49:25,215
Dreadful! Dreadful!

689
00:49:25,256 --> 00:49:28,635
Stand back, lads. Stand
back. Leave it to me.

690
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:31,262
- All taken care of.
- Constable, please.

691
00:49:31,304 --> 00:49:33,556
Not until Mr. Holmes has had a chance

692
00:49:33,598 --> 00:49:38,311
to investigate the body for clues.

693
00:49:57,205 --> 00:49:59,290
Yes.

694
00:49:59,332 --> 00:50:02,669
lt is my opinion that he is dead.

695
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:05,839
He's a genius.

696
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:17,100
Thank you, sir.
Two first-class tickets to London.

697
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:25,316
Well, Mr. Holmes, any theories?

698
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:30,739
Indeed. Obviously Giles and Ayres were caught
in a storm too far from the shore to swim for it.

699
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:35,410
Yes, and with that heavy suitcase attached
to his wrist and the lake being so deep.

700
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:38,413
Quite. Pulled the poor
wretch to the bottom,

701
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:43,835
struggling futilely,
flailing desperately,

702
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:49,758
as the cold, black water
sealed his fate for ever.

703
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:53,970
- Well, it's certainly been a lark. Thank you.
- Thank you very much indeed.

704
00:50:54,012 --> 00:50:56,431
We must be off.
Pleasure meeting you, Mr. Mayor.

705
00:50:56,473 --> 00:51:00,143
And the same, Doctor.

706
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:13,490
Now, we know for a fact
that Giles was on the boat.

707
00:51:13,531 --> 00:51:15,867
No, we don't.

708
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:21,331
Oh. Well, we do know for a fact
that Giles arrived in Windermere.

709
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:23,249
No, he didn't.

710
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:25,377
He didn't?

711
00:51:25,418 --> 00:51:28,380
I thought he did.

712
00:51:28,421 --> 00:51:35,553
Ah. Well, we really know that Giles
was behind the theft of the printing plates.

713
00:51:35,595 --> 00:51:38,723
No, he wasn't.

714
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:41,184
Fine.

715
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:46,940
Just trying to get things straight.

716
00:51:46,981 --> 00:51:48,817
Tell me something, Watson.

717
00:51:48,858 --> 00:51:51,569
Is there anything we do know for a fact?

718
00:51:51,611 --> 00:51:52,654
Yes.

719
00:51:52,696 --> 00:51:54,739
What?

720
00:51:54,781 --> 00:52:02,205
That, without doubt,
there is an evil mastermind behind all of this.

721
00:52:04,749 --> 00:52:07,711
Professor Moriarty?

722
00:52:07,752 --> 00:52:09,838
Oh, for God's sake.

723
00:52:09,879 --> 00:52:13,717
You didn't tell me that homicidal maniac
was involved in this.

724
00:52:13,758 --> 00:52:16,136
Because I knew you'd behave this way.

725
00:52:16,177 --> 00:52:19,389
Bravo! Another triumph
for deductive reasoning.

726
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:21,558
Don't you think you're overreacting?

727
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:26,021
Oh, pardon me.
Wasn't I the one who he tried to kill last night?

728
00:52:26,062 --> 00:52:28,606
- Merely a technicality.
- Maybe for you, mate.

729
00:52:28,648 --> 00:52:31,026
Think, man.

730
00:52:31,067 --> 00:52:34,904
Who was supposed to sleep in that room?

731
00:52:34,946 --> 00:52:37,240
That's true. You were.

732
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:39,117
Moriarty knows...

733
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:41,244
..I am the only match
for his evil genius.

734
00:52:41,286 --> 00:52:44,914
- Are you sure he's not trying to kill me?
- Of course not.

735
00:52:44,956 --> 00:52:48,960
He knows you're an idiot.

736
00:52:49,836 --> 00:52:52,630
Thank God.

737
00:53:06,102 --> 00:53:10,857
Whoa, there. Steady, steady. Stand.
There we are, miss.

738
00:53:10,899 --> 00:53:13,777
We're here.

739
00:53:19,324 --> 00:53:20,742
Thank you.

740
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:24,287
Ta very much, miss. Walk on.

741
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:27,290
Miss Lesley Giles?

742
00:53:27,332 --> 00:53:28,917
Yes?

743
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:36,174
Doctor John Watson at your service,
and this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

744
00:53:36,216 --> 00:53:39,511
Sherlock Holmes?

745
00:53:39,678 --> 00:53:41,262
But what do you want with me?

746
00:53:41,304 --> 00:53:45,767
The Government suspects that your father
has stolen the printing plates for the ?5 note.

747
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:47,602
What?

748
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:52,023
They also believe that he is at the bottom
of Lake Windermere, drowned like a rat.

749
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:54,317
Oh!

750
00:54:00,615 --> 00:54:01,658
Father?

751
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:03,660
Watson, get some water, please.

752
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:06,496
Of course.

753
00:54:07,914 --> 00:54:10,458
Father.

754
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:16,214
Sorry for the fright, Miss Giles.

755
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:18,883
Unfortunately, you fainted
before Holmes could add

756
00:54:18,925 --> 00:54:23,013
that he personally believes your father
not only innocent, but alive.

757
00:54:23,054 --> 00:54:24,931
Really?

758
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:27,851
Holmes believes
your father has been abducted.

759
00:54:27,892 --> 00:54:31,271
Abducted? By who?

760
00:54:31,396 --> 00:54:34,190
Abductors.

761
00:54:34,816 --> 00:54:40,655
You see, Miss Giles, your father
was described to us as fanatically neat.

762
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:45,160
A fact confirmed
by the immaculateness of this very place.

763
00:54:45,201 --> 00:54:52,042
I took the opportunity to have a look around,
and it is extremely tidy.

764
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:56,963
One must ask, therefore,
why such a compulsively neat man...

765
00:54:57,005 --> 00:55:01,509
..would leave an unmade bed,
unless he was snatched from that very bed.

766
00:55:01,551 --> 00:55:03,553
Oh, dear God!

767
00:55:03,595 --> 00:55:07,140
Then a man posing as your father
was sent to Windermere,

768
00:55:07,182 --> 00:55:09,267
where a mock drowning was staged,

769
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:14,105
unfortunately costing the life of an innocent
boatman named Ayres, forcibly drowned.

770
00:55:14,147 --> 00:55:17,567
- Murdered.
- Why?

771
00:55:19,277 --> 00:55:22,322
Why, you ask.

772
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:24,949
Because...

773
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:27,035
Fill in the details, Watson.

774
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:34,542
Because someone wanted us to believe that
your father and the printing plates were lost

775
00:55:34,584 --> 00:55:36,336
at the bottom of the lake.

776
00:55:36,378 --> 00:55:40,423
Thus Scotland Yard
and that poor misguided fool Lestrade

777
00:55:40,465 --> 00:55:43,468
would foolishly believe
that the case was closed,

778
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:50,892
leaving the true villain free to wreak havoc
with the economy of the Empire.

779
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:54,771
All quite...elementary.

780
00:56:01,027 --> 00:56:03,822
Let me go!

781
00:56:07,742 --> 00:56:09,828
Mr. Holmes!

782
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:11,204
Have courage, Miss Giles.

783
00:56:11,246 --> 00:56:14,165
You're not getting away that easy.

784
00:56:14,207 --> 00:56:16,209
Put me down!

785
00:56:16,251 --> 00:56:17,585
Put me down!

786
00:56:17,627 --> 00:56:20,630
You don't know who you're dealing with,
my friend.

787
00:56:20,672 --> 00:56:22,632
My name is Sherlock Holmes.

788
00:56:22,674 --> 00:56:25,635
Put me down!

789
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:33,852
That's my foot

790
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:37,105
That's my foot!

791
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:40,859
Look out!

792
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:44,070
Leave her!

793
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:48,491
Sorry about this, Miss Giles.

794
00:56:48,533 --> 00:56:50,243
Sorry about this, Miss Giles?!

795
00:56:50,285 --> 00:56:54,789
- Hurry.
- He's got my bleedin' shoe!

796
00:56:54,831 --> 00:56:58,501
- They've gone.
- I know. I chased them away.

797
00:56:58,543 --> 00:57:01,755
Oh, you brave, brave man.

798
00:57:01,796 --> 00:57:05,550
Danger is my trade, but not yours.

799
00:57:05,592 --> 00:57:08,094
It's unsafe for you to
sleep alone tonight...

800
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:09,721
..unattended.

801
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:11,848
Yes, we insist you stay with us.

802
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:15,769
- Oh, but surely I'd be an imposition.
- Think nothing of it, my dear.

803
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:23,735
lndeed, Holmes will be working all night anyway,
so you can have his room.

804
00:57:26,905 --> 00:57:29,991
Interesting. Of Italian manufacture.

805
00:57:30,033 --> 00:57:32,118
What?

806
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,704
This shoe - brand-new.

807
00:57:34,746 --> 00:57:38,166
Oh, yes. Very interesting.

808
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:41,336
Do you think...?
Do you think she's ready for bed yet?

809
00:57:41,378 --> 00:57:46,174
And, if I'm not mistaken, caked with mud
mainly found in the vicinity of the Thames.

810
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:48,426
The Thames, yes, yes.

811
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:52,931
Poor girl. Poor beautiful girl.

812
00:57:53,098 --> 00:57:55,975
Some sleep would do her good.

813
00:57:56,017 --> 00:58:02,732
I can picture her lying there,
her eyes closed, gently breathing.

814
00:58:02,774 --> 00:58:04,859
Her breasts heaving

815
00:58:04,901 --> 00:58:12,409
as her supple, nubile young body...
caresses the cool, limpid sheets.

816
00:58:14,786 --> 00:58:16,871
Yes, Thames it is.

817
00:58:16,913 --> 00:58:20,709
Near Southwark. Interesting, isn't it?

818
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,544
To say the least.

819
00:58:22,585 --> 00:58:26,673
Why would common ruffians
be wearing imported shoes?

820
00:58:26,715 --> 00:58:29,300
Not second-hand mind you but brand-new

821
00:58:29,342 --> 00:58:31,678
Ooh!

822
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:35,015
Agh!

823
00:58:35,056 --> 00:58:37,350
- What was that?
- What?

824
00:58:37,392 --> 00:58:41,646
Oh, if it's not one thing...

825
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:46,067
Oh, I'm sorry.
I suppose I must be still rather nervous.

826
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:48,194
You may rest easy, miss.

827
00:58:48,236 --> 00:58:51,614
No-one will disturb you tonight.
Isn't that so, Holmes?

828
00:58:51,656 --> 00:58:52,991
Quite.

829
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:55,160
Good night.

830
00:58:55,201 --> 00:58:58,079
Good night.

831
00:59:34,824 --> 00:59:37,452
Mr. Holmes?

832
00:59:37,494 --> 00:59:41,373
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realise you were still asleep.

833
00:59:41,414 --> 00:59:46,044
Asleep? Who can sleep
when there's work to be done?

834
00:59:46,086 --> 00:59:48,171
Dr Watson seems to have gone out.

835
00:59:48,213 --> 00:59:49,547
Really?

836
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:52,801
I wonder where.

837
00:59:53,551 --> 00:59:59,224
Who knows? He has very little patience
with detective work.

838
00:59:59,265 --> 01:00:02,143
Often becomes quite bored.

839
01:00:02,185 --> 01:00:04,771
- Yes?
- Yes.

840
01:00:04,813 --> 01:00:07,607
Your job must be very difficult.

841
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:10,193
One does get rather...tense.

842
01:00:10,235 --> 01:00:12,320
Oh, I can imagine.

843
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:14,447
The hardest thing...

844
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:19,869
..is to find ways to
relieve that tension.

845
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:27,877
So you play the violin?

846
01:00:28,461 --> 01:00:32,048
Only if worst comes to worst.

847
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:36,094
Well, I really don't want
to add to that tension, so

848
01:00:36,136 --> 01:00:42,308
- I think I'd better go and finish getting dressed.
- No, please. I assure you.

849
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:45,645
An occasional break is quite refreshing.

850
01:00:45,687 --> 01:00:49,024
- My mind thrives on diversity.
- Mr. Holmes!

851
01:00:49,065 --> 01:00:53,611
What? What? How many times
have I got to tell you to knock?

852
01:00:53,653 --> 01:00:57,323
Have you no respect
for people's privacy?

853
01:00:57,365 --> 01:01:03,496
Right. You've gone quite far enough,
overstepping the bounds of propriety.

854
01:01:03,538 --> 01:01:08,126
Come along, my dear. You'll be much safer
with me. We'll have tea downstairs.

855
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:11,171
- Now, there's a good idea.
- You have visitors.

856
01:01:11,212 --> 01:01:14,466
Such carryings-on
and in the middle of the day

857
01:01:14,507 --> 01:01:18,511
This is a respectable Presbyterian house,
I assure you.

858
01:01:18,553 --> 01:01:20,764
Take no notice, sir.
The woman drinks a bit.

859
01:01:20,805 --> 01:01:23,433
Come in. Welcome. Good
morning, inspector.

860
01:01:23,475 --> 01:01:27,562
Holmes. I've informed Lord Smithwick
of the findings in Windermere.

861
01:01:27,604 --> 01:01:29,773
Though the case did not
turn out as we hoped,

862
01:01:29,814 --> 01:01:33,693
Her Majesty did insist on rewarding you
for your efforts.

863
01:01:33,735 --> 01:01:39,032
A reward? Who am I
to go against the wishes of the Queen?

864
01:01:39,074 --> 01:01:42,577
Stunning, isn't it?

865
01:01:43,078 --> 01:01:45,038
I'm overwhelmed.

866
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:49,834
Pity you had to go all the way to Windermere
merely to confirm my theories.

867
01:01:49,876 --> 01:01:53,380
Think nothing of it, old man.
if I hadn't gone to Windermere,

868
01:01:53,421 --> 01:01:56,299
I could not have confirmed MY theories,

869
01:01:56,341 --> 01:02:00,303
namely that YOUR theories
are completely wrong.

870
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:02,972
- What's that?
- This is utter nonsense, sir.

871
01:02:03,014 --> 01:02:06,017
He refuses to accept
that I solved this case before he did.

872
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:07,686
- Hello.
- Giles is dead.

873
01:02:07,727 --> 01:02:11,022
The plate's lost, case closed.

874
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:13,858
Neither Giles nor the plates
were ever in Windermere.

875
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,568
Case open.

876
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:18,154
Really?

877
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:26,621
Well, gentlemen. I see Holmes
has taken you into his confidence.

878
01:02:26,663 --> 01:02:30,917
Did he also tell you that we expect
to conclude this case within three days?

879
01:02:30,959 --> 01:02:32,002
No.

880
01:02:32,043 --> 01:02:37,340
I'll let you fill in
the details, Holmes.

881
01:02:38,925 --> 01:02:41,469
Let me assure you, Lord Smithwick,

882
01:02:41,511 --> 01:02:45,974
that come...Friday, you
shall have your plates.

883
01:02:46,016 --> 01:02:49,769
You must succeed, Mr. Holmes...

884
01:02:49,811 --> 01:02:53,523
..before news of the theft leaks out...

885
01:02:53,565 --> 01:02:56,609
..and causes widespread panic
throughout the Empire.

886
01:02:56,651 --> 01:02:57,694
Steady, sir.

887
01:02:57,736 --> 01:03:00,155
Steady.

888
01:03:00,196 --> 01:03:03,825
That is exactly why the Empire,
now more than ever,

889
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:07,162
needs all of us to remain
calm and composed.

890
01:03:07,203 --> 01:03:11,124
Oh, you're right, of course.
We must remain composed.

891
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:14,919
- Composed
- And calm.

892
01:03:17,255 --> 01:03:20,425
- Friday? Are you out of your bloody mind?
- Steady on, old boy.

893
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:23,720
You've made some excellent discoveries
this morning.

894
01:03:23,762 --> 01:03:28,892
Get your coat on. We have a cab waiting.

895
01:03:28,933 --> 01:03:30,393
What discoveries?

896
01:03:30,435 --> 01:03:34,356
For one thing, the Royal Mint purchased
its paper from the Camden Paper Mill.

897
01:03:34,397 --> 01:03:38,193
- You make these things up, don't you?
- Mr. Holmes.

898
01:03:38,234 --> 01:03:43,823
Mr. Holmes. Those men, they were here
about my father, weren't they?

899
01:03:43,865 --> 01:03:46,326
- Oh, Dr Watson, good morning.
- Miss Giles.

900
01:03:46,368 --> 01:03:48,995
Is there any news? Anything at all?

901
01:03:49,037 --> 01:03:51,748
Sadly, no.

902
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:54,292
But take heart, miss.

903
01:03:54,334 --> 01:03:58,838
Last night something occurred to Holmes and
he suddenly realised how stupid he'd been.

904
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,340
Really?

905
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:03,385
- Well, I didn't exactly say stupid.
- Yes, you did.

906
01:04:03,426 --> 01:04:05,929
And now he's off to
continue the investigation.

907
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:07,931
Oh, perhaps I could come too.

908
01:04:07,972 --> 01:04:12,435
Trust me, miss,
the moment he knows anything, he'll tell you.

909
01:04:12,477 --> 01:04:13,520
Thank you.

910
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:16,981
- Cabbie.
- Go on.

911
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:31,079
What's that?

912
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:36,418
A reply to a telegram
I sent late last night.

913
01:04:36,459 --> 01:04:41,840
- You might let me in on the joke, old boy.
- In due time.

914
01:04:41,881 --> 01:04:43,800
Doctor! Doctor!

915
01:04:43,842 --> 01:04:46,177
- Doctor Watson!
- Cabbie

916
01:04:46,219 --> 01:04:48,263
Stop.

917
01:04:48,304 --> 01:04:50,473
You was dead right, Doctor. All of 'em,

918
01:04:50,515 --> 01:04:52,892
just sitting there, waiting for Customs.

919
01:04:52,934 --> 01:04:58,314
Wonderful. Just as I
thought. Hop in, lad.

920
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:03,111
Driver! Southwark Docks.

921
01:05:13,329 --> 01:05:17,000
Here will do, cabbie.

922
01:05:19,878 --> 01:05:21,171
Thanks, guvnor.

923
01:05:21,212 --> 01:05:23,840
Wiggins.

924
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:44,569
Here they are, Doctor.
We found 'em here this morning.

925
01:05:44,611 --> 01:05:45,653
Wonderful.

926
01:05:45,695 --> 01:05:49,949
All these crates, full
of imported shoes.

927
01:05:49,991 --> 01:05:52,535
And the ship?

928
01:05:52,577 --> 01:05:55,914
Got in this morning from Germany.
Two days late, she was.

929
01:05:55,955 --> 01:06:00,543
Excellent. You've done well, my boy.

930
01:06:00,585 --> 01:06:04,506
We'll take it from here.

931
01:06:11,012 --> 01:06:13,890
Picture it.

932
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:18,436
Two, three, maybe four
of Moriarty's henchmen

933
01:06:18,478 --> 01:06:22,941
waiting here under cover of darkness
for that ship, but it's delayed.

934
01:06:22,982 --> 01:06:25,985
They wait. They become bored.

935
01:06:26,027 --> 01:06:29,280
Being men of no moral fibre whatsoever,

936
01:06:29,322 --> 01:06:34,285
they can't resist helping themselves
to a new pair of shoes!

937
01:06:34,327 --> 01:06:39,374
Do you think they have these in brown?

938
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:58,393
I hate ltalian shoes.

939
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:16,244
Moriarty.

940
01:07:16,286 --> 01:07:20,540
- Moriarty?
- Without doubt.

941
01:07:23,877 --> 01:07:26,588
This one.

942
01:07:28,298 --> 01:07:31,718
Go on bust it open

943
01:07:44,606 --> 01:07:47,525
What's tinte?

944
01:07:47,567 --> 01:07:49,444
German for ink.

945
01:07:49,486 --> 01:07:52,906
He smuggled it in
to avoid the attention of Scotland Yard.

946
01:07:52,947 --> 01:07:55,867
Marvelous. He already
has the paper he needs.

947
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:58,578
He got it from the Camden Paper Mill,

948
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:01,623
burning the place to the ground
to cover the theft.

949
01:08:01,664 --> 01:08:06,419
And the John Clay case was staged
simply to throw me off the scent.

950
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:10,548
What's the German for pen?

951
01:08:12,801 --> 01:08:15,053
Hold it! What's all this, then?

952
01:08:15,095 --> 01:08:17,555
Blast!

953
01:08:19,432 --> 01:08:22,310
You can't be moving things about.

954
01:08:22,352 --> 01:08:25,730
lt has to be cleared through Customs,
and all that.

955
01:08:25,772 --> 01:08:29,859
Sorry, Professor. I
thought it was deserted.

956
01:08:29,901 --> 01:08:32,946
Sorry indeed.

957
01:08:34,155 --> 01:08:40,620
I went to all this trouble
for the sake of discretion...

958
01:08:42,038 --> 01:08:46,918
..and then you allow this to happen.

959
01:08:47,293 --> 01:08:49,713
Well?

960
01:09:05,061 --> 01:09:07,147
Do you have your revolver with you?

961
01:09:07,188 --> 01:09:10,400
Yes, somewhere.

962
01:09:16,948 --> 01:09:20,994
Come on. Let's not be all day about it.

963
01:09:21,036 --> 01:09:27,417
- Yes, here it is.
- I'm going to let you have some bullets for it.

964
01:09:27,459 --> 01:09:34,674
Try not to shoot yourself.
At least, not until I give the signal.

965
01:09:45,602 --> 01:09:48,313
Moriarty.

966
01:09:50,774 --> 01:09:53,193
Damn.

967
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:26,309
- Holmes!
- What?

968
01:10:36,861 --> 01:10:39,489
Come on!

969
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:45,286
Die, Moriarty.

970
01:10:53,461 --> 01:10:55,046
Come on!

971
01:10:55,088 --> 01:10:59,968
They can't follow us down the canal.

972
01:11:00,176 --> 01:11:05,390
How demeaning to be set upon by nitwits.

973
01:11:14,357 --> 01:11:16,901
Watson.

974
01:11:22,907 --> 01:11:25,452
Watson?

975
01:11:28,455 --> 01:11:32,500
What are you doing? Watson?

976
01:11:32,542 --> 01:11:34,961
Damn!

977
01:11:38,882 --> 01:11:42,552
Oh, Watson, look out!

978
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:07,994
Watson?

979
01:12:08,036 --> 01:12:10,580
Watson?

980
01:12:11,831 --> 01:12:15,043
Watson? Watson?

981
01:12:24,636 --> 01:12:28,056
No luck, sergeant.

982
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:34,604
- Anything?
- No, sir.

983
01:12:34,646 --> 01:12:40,819
The tide may have carried the body
miles down river.

984
01:13:16,688 --> 01:13:17,731
Mr. Holmes...

985
01:13:17,772 --> 01:13:20,233
..is it true?

986
01:13:20,275 --> 01:13:24,362
Yes, I'm afraid it's true.

987
01:13:28,241 --> 01:13:32,203
Mrs. Hudson, I am so sorry.

988
01:13:32,245 --> 01:13:38,251
He was such a good man.
I can't believe he's gone.

989
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,962
I know it's difficult
at such a time, but...

990
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:47,177
..if it's any consolation,
we still have Mr. Holmes.

991
01:13:47,427 --> 01:13:51,514
Did I say something wrong?

992
01:14:00,357 --> 01:14:02,609
Oh!

993
01:14:06,404 --> 01:14:10,075
I seem to have overestimated
the amount of rope required.

994
01:14:10,116 --> 01:14:12,577
One more thing I've botched.

995
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:15,789
Mr. Holmes! What would Dr. Watson say?

996
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:18,750
He would have volunteered
to kick the chair from under me.

997
01:14:18,792 --> 01:14:20,293
He would not.

998
01:14:20,335 --> 01:14:22,796
He said this was going to be
our last case together.

999
01:14:22,837 --> 01:14:24,673
Mr. Holmes.

1000
01:14:24,714 --> 01:14:27,425
Mr. Holmes!

1001
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:31,388
You mustn't blame yourself.
You can still avenge the Doctor's death

1002
01:14:31,429 --> 01:14:35,100
by capturing this Professor Moriarty
and rescuing my father.

1003
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:36,935
Oh, what a good idea!

1004
01:14:36,976 --> 01:14:40,021
While I'm at it,
I'll bring in the Loch Ness Monster.

1005
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:42,899
Please, Mr. Holmes. I don't understand.

1006
01:14:42,941 --> 01:14:46,236
I am not a detective. I
never solved anything.

1007
01:14:46,277 --> 01:14:49,280
- Dr Watson did.
- Oh, nonsense. You're just upset.

1008
01:14:49,322 --> 01:14:52,325
I couldn't detect horse
manure if I stepped in it.

1009
01:14:52,367 --> 01:14:54,869
Please, Mr. Holmes!

1010
01:14:54,911 --> 01:14:57,372
Sorry.

1011
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:17,892
- Another one, Mr. Holmes?
- Yes, please.

1012
01:15:17,934 --> 01:15:20,186
Stop.

1013
01:15:20,228 --> 01:15:23,023
Perhaps not.

1014
01:15:23,064 --> 01:15:28,737
I'm afraid my grief has
exceeded my resources.

1015
01:15:31,072 --> 01:15:37,620
- It's on the house, Mr. Holmes.
- Why, thank you, Henry.

1016
01:15:37,996 --> 01:15:40,874
Mr. Holmes.

1017
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:44,169
Thank goodness.

1018
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:48,631
Mrs. Hudson said we might find you here.

1019
01:15:48,673 --> 01:15:52,469
We want to offer you our condolences.

1020
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:56,181
Pity about Dr Watson.

1021
01:15:56,264 --> 01:16:03,480
I trust, however, it will have no bearing
on the outcome of the case.

1022
01:16:03,521 --> 01:16:04,564
What?

1023
01:16:04,606 --> 01:16:08,985
You vowed to solve the case by Friday.

1024
01:16:09,027 --> 01:16:12,614
Ah, well, you see...

1025
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:20,038
..the fact... The fact of the matter is,
you see, Lord Smithwick, is Dr Watson...

1026
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,500
I believe what Mr.
Holmes is trying to say

1027
01:16:23,541 --> 01:16:26,753
is that it was Dr Watson
who first made that pledge.

1028
01:16:26,795 --> 01:16:30,465
And er...with all due respect,

1029
01:16:30,507 --> 01:16:34,302
I am sure he did not fully understand
the complexities of the case.

1030
01:16:34,344 --> 01:16:36,930
As I have tried to point
out to Your Lordship,

1031
01:16:36,971 --> 01:16:41,518
Her Majesty should rely on the counsel
of trained criminologists such as myself.

1032
01:16:41,559 --> 01:16:48,024
Though well-meaning,
the good Doctor was...no detective.

1033
01:16:49,567 --> 01:16:52,278
As I was about to say, Lord Smithwick,

1034
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:58,493
Dr Watson was decidedly precise
in his estimate of the closure of this case.

1035
01:16:58,535 --> 01:17:00,829
Have no fear.

1036
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:07,043
You shall have the plates in your hands
come Friday.

1037
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:14,384
Mrs. Hudson?

1038
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:17,345
- What?
- The game's afoot.

1039
01:17:17,387 --> 01:17:19,639
Oh!

1040
01:17:20,598 --> 01:17:25,937
Dr Watson always said,
"Start by listing everything you know."

1041
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:28,231
So, let us begin.

1042
01:17:28,273 --> 01:17:31,317
Number...one.

1043
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:33,153
Moriarty.

1044
01:17:33,194 --> 01:17:36,698
Isn't he wonderful?

1045
01:17:38,033 --> 01:17:42,037
He is behind all this.
That's one thing we know.

1046
01:17:42,078 --> 01:17:45,540
Very good. We are progressing nicely.

1047
01:17:45,582 --> 01:17:47,667
Now, the next thing we know.

1048
01:17:47,709 --> 01:17:50,587
Number two.

1049
01:17:54,466 --> 01:18:00,638
This might take a while.
I'll away and get some tea.

1050
01:18:01,222 --> 01:18:03,641
What?

1051
01:18:14,861 --> 01:18:17,655
All right.

1052
01:18:18,031 --> 01:18:23,953
Let's go back to number one.
Perhaps the clue's in Moriarty's name.

1053
01:18:23,995 --> 01:18:26,581
Clever people often do that.

1054
01:18:26,623 --> 01:18:29,417
Er, amity.

1055
01:18:29,668 --> 01:18:32,212
Rarity.

1056
01:18:33,004 --> 01:18:35,090
I've got it!

1057
01:18:35,131 --> 01:18:38,176
His real name is Arty Morty.

1058
01:18:38,218 --> 01:18:42,847
What the hell am I talking about?

1059
01:18:43,056 --> 01:18:45,225
I found a ?5 note floating in the river.

1060
01:18:45,266 --> 01:18:48,853
- Lucky you!
- But it's only half-printed.

1061
01:18:48,895 --> 01:18:54,025
I suppose it's only worth ?2 10s, then.

1062
01:18:55,944 --> 01:18:58,363
Er...

1063
01:18:59,364 --> 01:19:00,407
Everyone knows

1064
01:19:00,448 --> 01:19:06,037
that the normal ?5 note carries a serial number
which contains five digits.

1065
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:09,791
- Six digits.
- Six digits. This one contains only three.

1066
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:12,293
2-3-4.

1067
01:19:12,627 --> 01:19:13,962
What does that mean?

1068
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:22,387
Here, her father's a printer, ain't he?
Maybe he's trying to tell us where he is.

1069
01:19:22,429 --> 01:19:25,181
What can these numbers mean?

1070
01:19:25,223 --> 01:19:27,308
They could be a measurement, an address.

1071
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:29,936
- An amount. 234 of something.
- A page number.

1072
01:19:29,978 --> 01:19:32,605
- Did your father have a favourite book?
- I...

1073
01:19:32,647 --> 01:19:35,817
- He did. The Bible.
- Yes.

1074
01:19:35,859 --> 01:19:39,904
I have a Bible. It's at my bedside.

1075
01:19:39,946 --> 01:19:42,323
Is there something on page 234?

1076
01:19:42,365 --> 01:19:44,784
Page numbers vary
from Bible to Bible,

1077
01:19:44,826 --> 01:19:48,538
but chapter and verse
is the same in every Bible.

1078
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,999
Did your father have
a favourite book of the Bible?

1079
01:19:51,041 --> 01:19:53,626
Yes he did

1080
01:19:53,668 --> 01:19:55,754
The Book of Psalms.

1081
01:19:55,795 --> 01:19:58,965
Psalms, Psalms.
Twenty-third Psalm, verse four.

1082
01:19:59,007 --> 01:20:03,053
"Yea, though I walk
through the valley of...

1083
01:20:03,094 --> 01:20:05,180
..the shadow of death."

1084
01:20:05,221 --> 01:20:07,849
- Does that mean something?
- Yes

1085
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:11,644
- That means the Orpheum Theatre.
- What?

1086
01:20:11,686 --> 01:20:13,772
What are you talking about?

1087
01:20:13,813 --> 01:20:18,193
I'm sorry, Mr. Holmes,
but I just don't understand.

1088
01:20:18,234 --> 01:20:20,111
The Shadow Of Death,

1089
01:20:20,153 --> 01:20:23,782
a gripping drama, was the last play
presented at the Orpheum.

1090
01:20:23,823 --> 01:20:27,827
It closed after only one night,
but not without garnering some praise.

1091
01:20:27,869 --> 01:20:29,954
Harris in The Daily Telegram said,

1092
01:20:29,996 --> 01:20:32,332
"In an otherwise dismal evening,

1093
01:20:32,374 --> 01:20:35,418
Reginald Kincaid provided
some welcome laughs."

1094
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:38,838
Laughs? You said it
was a gripping drama.

1095
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,967
It's unimportant now, isn't it?

1096
01:20:43,009 --> 01:20:45,553
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

1097
01:20:45,595 --> 01:20:47,972
- Cab.
- Oh dear

1098
01:20:48,014 --> 01:20:53,186
The Fleet River runs under that part of town.
The Orpheum Theatre stands right on top of it.

1099
01:20:53,228 --> 01:20:56,815
He could be onto something.
There's tunnels and caverns all under there.

1100
01:20:56,856 --> 01:20:59,150
Ju...just a moment!

1101
01:20:59,192 --> 01:21:01,653
We haven't got a moment, Mrs. Hudson.

1102
01:21:01,695 --> 01:21:02,737
Wiggins,

1103
01:21:02,779 --> 01:21:05,573
- fetch Scotland Yard.
- Oh, let me, Mr. Holmes.

1104
01:21:05,615 --> 01:21:08,827
I'm sure they'll be much more inclined
to listen to me.

1105
01:21:08,868 --> 01:21:10,745
Good idea. Wiggins, on the back.

1106
01:21:10,787 --> 01:21:13,123
The Orpheum Theatre.
We haven't a moment to lose.

1107
01:21:13,164 --> 01:21:18,294
Right you are, guv. Come on. On you go.

1108
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:30,640
You know, I kind of liked you better
when you was a coward.

1109
01:21:30,682 --> 01:21:33,018
Shh!

1110
01:21:34,561 --> 01:21:37,772
- The stage door's round the back. Go ahead.
- YOU go ahead.

1111
01:21:37,814 --> 01:21:41,234
Wiggins, go ahead.

1112
01:21:44,487 --> 01:21:46,906
Back!

1113
01:21:51,578 --> 01:21:55,165
There you go, gents.

1114
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:57,792
Moriarty.

1115
01:21:57,834 --> 01:22:01,129
There you go, my good man.

1116
01:22:01,171 --> 01:22:03,548
- Keep the change.
- A fiver!

1117
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:05,508
God bless you, guvnor.

1118
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:08,428
- Think nothing of it. I print my own.
- Print my own?

1119
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:11,890
That's a good one!

1120
01:22:12,557 --> 01:22:17,520
Still, we can't afford to waste them.

1121
01:22:54,974 --> 01:22:58,687
We shall move the
barge out at high tide.

1122
01:22:58,728 --> 01:23:01,314
I shall miss this place...

1123
01:23:01,356 --> 01:23:03,858
..somewhat.

1124
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:07,737
Go around the front, and when the police
get here, tell them what happened.

1125
01:23:07,779 --> 01:23:09,614
Right you are, guv.

1126
01:23:09,656 --> 01:23:13,702
And er...the best of British luck to you both.
You're going to need it.

1127
01:23:13,743 --> 01:23:17,038
And don't move until they get here.

1128
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:19,416
Mrs. Hudson.

1129
01:23:19,457 --> 01:23:22,168
Up we go.

1130
01:23:33,638 --> 01:23:34,681
Hold on to that.

1131
01:23:34,723 --> 01:23:37,434
Slowly. Slowly.

1132
01:23:37,475 --> 01:23:40,687
Slowly. Slowly.

1133
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:47,777
Where are we going, Mrs. Hudson?

1134
01:23:47,819 --> 01:23:48,987
Where are we going?

1135
01:23:49,029 --> 01:23:51,740
Don't kick the...

1136
01:23:51,781 --> 01:23:54,492
..bucket.

1137
01:24:51,174 --> 01:24:53,510
Hmm.

1138
01:24:57,055 --> 01:24:59,599
Let go!

1139
01:25:01,142 --> 01:25:04,896
Are you quite serious?

1140
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:25,125
- Mr. Holmes.
- Yes?

1141
01:25:25,166 --> 01:25:27,794
Do you do this kind of thing on purpose?

1142
01:25:27,836 --> 01:25:30,797
Shh. Listen.

1143
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:36,553
Nothing, Professor. Probably rats.

1144
01:25:36,594 --> 01:25:39,723
Ah, yes. Rats.

1145
01:25:45,937 --> 01:25:48,356
I think...

1146
01:25:48,398 --> 01:25:52,777
I think it's louder over here.

1147
01:25:53,319 --> 01:25:56,197
It might...

1148
01:26:02,662 --> 01:26:06,708
Oh, I am so dreadfully sorry.

1149
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:10,170
On the contrary.
I think we're making very good progress.

1150
01:26:10,211 --> 01:26:12,547
Shh.

1151
01:26:45,872 --> 01:26:50,043
There's a hole in the wall.

1152
01:27:00,428 --> 01:27:04,599
I'm not staying round here.

1153
01:27:12,816 --> 01:27:16,486
Daddy wouldn't buy me

1154
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:19,531
A bow-wow

1155
01:27:19,781 --> 01:27:21,449
Bow-wow

1156
01:27:21,491 --> 01:27:25,662
There the ink's not dry yet

1157
01:27:26,371 --> 01:27:29,040
More paper over here

1158
01:27:29,082 --> 01:27:31,876
Hand over.

1159
01:27:40,343 --> 01:27:45,390
You've done a splendid job, Mr. Giles.

1160
01:27:47,475 --> 01:27:50,854
The Queen herself
could hardly tell the difference.

1161
01:27:50,895 --> 01:27:52,981
However...

1162
01:27:53,023 --> 01:27:57,027
..this one seems
to have been only half-printed.

1163
01:27:57,068 --> 01:27:59,154
It was found on the bank of the river.

1164
01:27:59,195 --> 01:28:02,699
I've got a pussycat

1165
01:28:03,908 --> 01:28:05,994
And I'm very fond of that

1166
01:28:06,036 --> 01:28:08,288
A reject.

1167
01:28:08,329 --> 01:28:10,415
It must have slipped away.

1168
01:28:10,457 --> 01:28:13,752
- And the tide carried it out?
- Hm, the tide, that's all.

1169
01:28:13,793 --> 01:28:18,006
Suppose we have a look at this reject
Shall we?

1170
01:28:18,048 --> 01:28:20,508
2-3-4.

1171
01:28:23,053 --> 01:28:26,348
Oh, yes, clever.

1172
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:30,977
How many of these rejects
accidentally slipped away?

1173
01:28:31,019 --> 01:28:32,103
Er well I

1174
01:28:32,145 --> 01:28:37,400
No matter. Shame that the only person capable
of deducing your clue is currently lying

1175
01:28:37,442 --> 01:28:41,112
at the bottom of the Thames.

1176
01:28:41,154 --> 01:28:45,075
What are you doing here?

1177
01:28:45,617 --> 01:28:49,621
I told you to keep an eye on that imbecile
He may yet stumble onto something

1178
01:28:49,662 --> 01:28:51,748
He has.

1179
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:54,626
Oh, they know all about this place.

1180
01:28:54,668 --> 01:28:57,337
Luckily for you
they sent me to fetch Scotland Yard

1181
01:28:57,379 --> 01:29:01,132
All right. No Scotland Yard. Fine.

1182
01:29:01,174 --> 01:29:03,134
No need to panic.

1183
01:29:03,176 --> 01:29:04,719
Mm-hm.

1184
01:29:04,761 --> 01:29:08,473
I need a good plan. Attack.

1185
01:29:08,515 --> 01:29:11,768
Attack with what?

1186
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:14,062
Ah.

1187
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:18,775
Clever enough to get us this far

1188
01:29:18,817 --> 01:29:22,028
That's no good.

1189
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:25,448
Start packing.

1190
01:29:27,033 --> 01:29:31,454
ln spite of this latest piece of foolishness,
you've done your job well.

1191
01:29:31,496 --> 01:29:35,542
Your reward will be a quick
and relatively painless departure.

1192
01:29:35,583 --> 01:29:39,170
Not so fast Moriarty

1193
01:29:42,674 --> 01:29:44,300
Watson.

1194
01:29:44,342 --> 01:29:48,179
I've been waiting hours
for your arrival...

1195
01:29:48,221 --> 01:29:50,223
..Professor.

1196
01:29:50,265 --> 01:29:53,893
- Dr Watson, thank God you're here. These...
- Please, my dear.

1197
01:29:53,935 --> 01:29:57,480
Ingenious, planting a spy in our midst.

1198
01:29:57,522 --> 01:30:00,984
That staged attack at
Giles' was quite realistic.

1199
01:30:01,026 --> 01:30:07,157
However, a cable to France revealed
a rather unique fact about the real Miss Giles.

1200
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:14,497
Something of an embarrassment
to the Giles family, I should think.

1201
01:30:29,095 --> 01:30:33,683
Perhaps you would like to meet
the real Lesley Giles.

1202
01:30:33,725 --> 01:30:36,561
Lesley. Lesley.

1203
01:30:36,603 --> 01:30:40,398
All right. Back to first plan.

1204
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:41,483
Attack.

1205
01:30:41,524 --> 01:30:44,569
Pity you won't be able to share
my greatest triumph,

1206
01:30:44,611 --> 01:30:48,406
the forcing of an empire to its knees.

1207
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:55,080
But you will be allowed
to see these two die...before you.

1208
01:31:03,129 --> 01:31:04,631
Right.

1209
01:31:04,673 --> 01:31:07,717
Don't anybody move.

1210
01:31:07,759 --> 01:31:11,221
Otherwise there'll be
an impromptu roasting.

1211
01:31:11,262 --> 01:31:14,140
Has it occurred to you, Mr. Holmes,

1212
01:31:14,182 --> 01:31:16,267
that if you set fire to that money,

1213
01:31:16,309 --> 01:31:19,062
you will burn to death yourself?

1214
01:31:19,104 --> 01:31:21,272
Er...

1215
01:31:21,314 --> 01:31:24,693
Of course it has.

1216
01:31:25,902 --> 01:31:28,697
Put out those flames!

1217
01:31:28,738 --> 01:31:33,952
Damn it to hell!
Don't just stand there!

1218
01:31:35,453 --> 01:31:36,871
Moriarty!

1219
01:31:36,913 --> 01:31:39,624
Look out!

1220
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:45,296
Get your backs into it. Come on!

1221
01:31:50,051 --> 01:31:52,137
I thought you were dead.

1222
01:31:52,178 --> 01:31:55,849
You may yet be right.

1223
01:31:58,518 --> 01:32:03,064
I'm not done with you yet Watson

1224
01:32:17,162 --> 01:32:19,706
Come on

1225
01:32:19,748 --> 01:32:22,083
Come on Put sand on it

1226
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:23,918
Get some water in here

1227
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:25,670
Clear those boxes!

1228
01:32:25,712 --> 01:32:29,090
Leave this to me.

1229
01:32:34,971 --> 01:32:36,681
There, there, my dear.

1230
01:32:36,723 --> 01:32:40,977
We're in a tinderbox in here

1231
01:32:42,437 --> 01:32:45,565
What was that?

1232
01:32:47,275 --> 01:32:50,862
- Come here, you cowards.
- Get clear of the mains.

1233
01:32:50,904 --> 01:32:54,574
Professor the gas mains
They could blow in the heat

1234
01:32:54,616 --> 01:32:59,704
Keep them pinned down.
I'll get the plates.

1235
01:32:59,746 --> 01:33:04,376
It's all over now, my pretty one.

1236
01:33:08,338 --> 01:33:12,884
You're disappointed, aren't you?

1237
01:33:20,433 --> 01:33:22,852
Hell!

1238
01:33:31,986 --> 01:33:33,029
Brilliant!

1239
01:33:33,071 --> 01:33:39,536
Watson, why didn't you kill him
when you had the chance?

1240
01:33:39,661 --> 01:33:43,748
Rock of ages, cleft for me

1241
01:33:46,126 --> 01:33:50,213
Let me hide myself in thee

1242
01:33:52,966 --> 01:33:55,135
Rock of ages...

1243
01:33:55,176 --> 01:33:57,971
Go on, hurry up!

1244
01:33:58,013 --> 01:34:02,976
Get moving. Come on. Come on, George.

1245
01:34:05,812 --> 01:34:11,109
- Let's get out of here.
- The back door!

1246
01:34:26,916 --> 01:34:30,337
Get your hands up!

1247
01:34:31,504 --> 01:34:35,175
It's safe, Professor.

1248
01:34:43,099 --> 01:34:44,225
Come on.

1249
01:34:44,267 --> 01:34:47,437
This is an escape, not a cakewalk.

1250
01:34:47,479 --> 01:34:52,692
Oh, please. Don't wait for me, will you?

1251
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:55,612
Oh!

1252
01:34:55,653 --> 01:34:57,906
Oh, mercy me!

1253
01:34:57,947 --> 01:35:03,411
Oh, my dear! That must
have been so painful.

1254
01:35:03,453 --> 01:35:05,914
Hello?

1255
01:35:06,831 --> 01:35:08,792
There he is!

1256
01:35:08,833 --> 01:35:10,794
You hold them off.

1257
01:35:10,835 --> 01:35:14,422
Just like I told you

1258
01:35:15,256 --> 01:35:19,636
- Oh, my head.
- It's all right, dear. It's still there.

1259
01:35:19,678 --> 01:35:22,472
Dr Watson!

1260
01:35:23,014 --> 01:35:26,685
- Ah. Sorry, Mrs. Hudson.
- Come on Watson There's a fire down here

1261
01:35:26,726 --> 01:35:31,564
It became necessary for me to stage my death,
so I might work unobserved for a few days.

1262
01:35:31,606 --> 01:35:37,654
And I must say,
you've caused quite a bit of grief.

1263
01:35:37,696 --> 01:35:40,532
You needn't bother with her.
She's an imposter.

1264
01:35:40,573 --> 01:35:43,326
She's not Lesley Giles? Then who is?

1265
01:35:43,368 --> 01:35:45,787
I am.

1266
01:35:47,664 --> 01:35:51,084
There you have it.

1267
01:35:52,836 --> 01:35:56,506
Ladies and gentlemen,

1268
01:35:56,631 --> 01:36:01,177
you seem to be blocking my exit.

1269
01:36:03,346 --> 01:36:06,766
Kindly step aside.

1270
01:36:15,734 --> 01:36:17,318
Watson...

1271
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:22,323
..remove these people from the stage.

1272
01:36:25,076 --> 01:36:27,620
Locked.

1273
01:36:30,582 --> 01:36:34,127
Ordinarily, I do not bother
with halfwits and buffoons.

1274
01:36:34,169 --> 01:36:37,380
Buffoon, is it?

1275
01:36:40,008 --> 01:36:41,593
Buffoons, is it?

1276
01:36:41,634 --> 01:36:44,554
- He'll be killed.
- I quite doubt it, Mrs. Hudson.

1277
01:36:44,596 --> 01:36:46,890
He's in his element now.

1278
01:36:46,931 --> 01:36:49,267
I warn you, sir...

1279
01:36:49,309 --> 01:36:54,731
..I've killed as many
as six men in a week.

1280
01:36:54,814 --> 01:36:59,152
Eight, if you count matinees.

1281
01:37:07,410 --> 01:37:13,291
"The brilliant swordsmanship
of Reginald Kincaid...

1282
01:37:13,333 --> 01:37:16,586
..was almost worth the
price of admission,"

1283
01:37:16,628 --> 01:37:20,715
raved the critic of The...

1284
01:37:20,799 --> 01:37:23,051
..Cotswold Press.

1285
01:37:23,093 --> 01:37:27,847
All right, put your shoulders to it, men.
Let's have it down.

1286
01:37:27,889 --> 01:37:32,435
The rest of you, round the back.

1287
01:37:37,357 --> 01:37:40,735
Right, my friend!

1288
01:37:54,916 --> 01:37:58,837
He really is quite good.

1289
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:12,976
- Follow me.
- Follow him, lads.

1290
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:27,574
Trying to be funny eh?

1291
01:38:29,534 --> 01:38:33,038
Don't anybody move!

1292
01:38:33,538 --> 01:38:37,876
Stay where you are, everyone.

1293
01:38:40,754 --> 01:38:42,422
Right.

1294
01:38:42,464 --> 01:38:45,592
I have killed before,
and I can assure you,

1295
01:38:45,633 --> 01:38:48,845
I have absolutely no compunction
about doing so again.

1296
01:38:48,887 --> 01:38:52,849
You are not dealing with an amateur,
you know.

1297
01:38:52,891 --> 01:38:56,186
Oh, well played.

1298
01:39:01,191 --> 01:39:03,568
Once more unto the breach, dear friends.

1299
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:06,488
Holmes, no!

1300
01:39:06,821 --> 01:39:08,531
Dr Watson, you're alive.

1301
01:39:08,573 --> 01:39:13,953
Astounding observation, inspector.
We must discuss it.

1302
01:39:13,995 --> 01:39:16,664
Well done

1303
01:39:16,706 --> 01:39:19,501
Oh, hello.

1304
01:39:33,473 --> 01:39:34,974
Stop!

1305
01:39:35,016 --> 01:39:39,813
Stand back, Watson. I'm about to bring
the world's greatest criminal to justice,

1306
01:39:39,854 --> 01:39:44,984
- and nothing's going to stop me.
- Have you forgotten the gas mains?

1307
01:39:45,026 --> 01:39:47,570
Aaargh!

1308
01:40:08,883 --> 01:40:12,095
More pressure. Come on, boys.
Come on, more pressure.

1309
01:40:12,137 --> 01:40:14,222
Pump harder. Come on.

1310
01:40:14,264 --> 01:40:16,057
More pressure.

1311
01:40:16,099 --> 01:40:19,144
Congratulations, Mr. Holmes.

1312
01:40:19,185 --> 01:40:24,941
Her Majesty wishes to offer you
her sincerest appreciation for a job well done.

1313
01:40:24,983 --> 01:40:30,113
Oh, and you too, Dr Watson.
Mr. Giles tells me

1314
01:40:30,155 --> 01:40:33,408
that you both deciphered the clue.

1315
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:36,244
I doubted if anyone would understand it.

1316
01:40:36,286 --> 01:40:39,122
- Child's play.
- Twenty-third Psalm.

1317
01:40:39,164 --> 01:40:41,708
Shadow Of Death.
Elementary.

1318
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:44,711
No, no, no, no. No, I...

1319
01:40:44,753 --> 01:40:50,258
I was referring to the
serial number. 2-3-4.

1320
01:40:50,967 --> 01:40:56,639
The address of the theatre.
234 Beacon Street.

1321
01:40:57,098 --> 01:40:59,726
Amazing!

1322
01:41:02,771 --> 01:41:05,774
- Watson...
- Don't worry, I'll fix it in the story.

1323
01:41:05,815 --> 01:41:09,069
The arrests were made
and the rest of the story you know

1324
01:41:09,110 --> 01:41:12,989
I don't mean to toot my own horn,
you understand.

1325
01:41:13,031 --> 01:41:16,076
Ah, Mr. Holmes. Nice bit of work, this.

1326
01:41:16,117 --> 01:41:18,411
But as I was telling Miss Giles,

1327
01:41:18,453 --> 01:41:21,081
had it not been for the timely arrival
of Scotland Yard,

1328
01:41:21,122 --> 01:41:23,249
I doubt it would have
turned out so well.

1329
01:41:23,291 --> 01:41:29,756
Of course, I realise
you would never admit such a thing.

1330
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:32,300
On the contrary, lnspector.

1331
01:41:32,342 --> 01:41:36,304
Indeed, Holmes was telling me
how indispensable you were.

1332
01:41:36,346 --> 01:41:41,810
As a matter of fact, Miss Giles,
it is to Lestrade, and Lestrade alone,

1333
01:41:41,851 --> 01:41:44,020
that you owe your deepest gratitude.

1334
01:41:44,062 --> 01:41:45,522
Really?

1335
01:41:45,563 --> 01:41:47,565
Miss Giles is on the stage, you know.

1336
01:41:47,607 --> 01:41:50,068
In Paris.

1337
01:41:50,110 --> 01:41:54,572
A revue called Les Femmes Faux.

1338
01:41:56,449 --> 01:42:00,120
An actress? What a surprise.

1339
01:42:00,161 --> 01:42:04,958
There's more surprises yet to come.

1340
01:42:26,104 --> 01:42:28,189
- Good morning.
- Morning, sir.

1341
01:42:28,231 --> 01:42:31,317
Excuse me, sir. Is it true
that Moriarty is dead?

1342
01:42:31,359 --> 01:42:35,238
Never assume, gentlemen. Never assume.

1343
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:39,242
Mr. Holmes, how did you know
where Moriarty was hiding out?

1344
01:42:39,284 --> 01:42:44,581
It was an elementary deduction
based on the clues at hand, I can assure you.

1345
01:42:44,622 --> 01:42:47,500
- But how is it that Scotland Yard did not...?
- Perhaps...

1346
01:42:47,542 --> 01:42:53,340
Perhaps Scotland Yard
did not have the invaluable assistance,

1347
01:42:53,381 --> 01:42:59,137
the keen insight
and the extraordinary patience

1348
01:42:59,763 --> 01:43:03,183
of Dr John Watson.

1349
01:43:09,314 --> 01:43:12,108
My friend.

1350
01:43:17,447 --> 01:43:19,532
Hear, hear! Quite right, man.

1351
01:43:19,574 --> 01:43:22,452
Hear, hear!

1352
01:43:23,036 --> 01:43:28,166
Now, gentlemen and ladies, I have
an announcement of some consequence.

1353
01:43:28,208 --> 01:43:32,087
With the safe return of the plates
to the Royal Mint,

1354
01:43:32,128 --> 01:43:36,174
I must inform you that
this is my last case.

1355
01:43:36,216 --> 01:43:37,717
Oh, no!

1356
01:43:37,759 --> 01:43:40,845
Sherlock Holmes is retiring.

1357
01:43:40,887 --> 01:43:43,431
Surely not, sir. That cannot be!

1358
01:43:43,473 --> 01:43:45,892
- I don't believe it.
- Dr Watson, is it possible?

1359
01:43:45,934 --> 01:43:48,186
Of course it's not possible.

1360
01:43:48,228 --> 01:43:51,106
Mr. Holmes is merely pulling your leg.
Aren't you, Holmes?

1361
01:43:51,147 --> 01:43:54,651
Sherlock Holmes retire when there is
murder and mayhem at every turn?

1362
01:43:54,693 --> 01:43:59,739
Already several adventures have begun to take
shape which can be solved by no-one else.

1363
01:43:59,781 --> 01:44:01,032
Right, Holmes?

1364
01:44:01,074 --> 01:44:04,828
Right you are, Watson.

1365
01:44:07,914 --> 01:44:11,209
And so, without further ado...

1366
01:44:11,251 --> 01:44:15,171
..I hereby declare this case...

1367
01:44:15,213 --> 01:44:17,924
..closed.
