ON THE EDGE

21
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,291
We're at the Russian Fencing Cup
with only minutes

22
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,208
to go until the Semifinals.

23
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:29,875
Women's Sabre is ballet with a blade.

24
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,750
Fencing is the second fastest sport.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,750
Only a bullet is faster than a Sabre.

26
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:55,041
Come on. Hey. Wake up.
They've announced you twice already.

27
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:15,375
Kira Yegorova. Where's she from?
Do you know of her?

28
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,708
Yeah. She's only done junior competitions.

29
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:20,208
This is her first senior championship.

30
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,208
So, did you sleep well?

31
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,291
U-huh.

32
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,125
I'll briefly go over the basic
rules. The bout lasts to 15 touches.

33
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,333
A point is awarded to the
one who touches first.

34
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,500
Only the touches
above the waist count.

35
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,708
On guard! Ready?

36
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:44,791
Excuse me.

37
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,333
What on Earth's the matter?

38
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,333
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:52,500
Is she stalling on purpose?

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,416
-Good strategy!
-I like her more by the minute.

41
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:57,666
And Nina is getting annoyed with her.

42
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,875
-Do you mind our presence?
-No.

43
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,291
On guard! Ready? Fence!

44
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,833
That... What was that right now?

45
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,791
An impressive speed.

46
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:25,916
Fence!

47
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,458
It's the second one-light action and it's
impressive.

48
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,250
She's not bad. Huh?

49
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:38,833
Halt!

50
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:41,791
She's lacking versatility though.
She's got just a handful of means.

51
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,500
Her technique is weak too.

52
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,625
Fence!

53
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:48,541
And what are you going to do about her
speed?

54
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,166
I'll drag her into a positioning bout.

55
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,416
Uhm. Well, go ahead, try it.
I'm intrigued to see it.

56
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,666
Fence! Halt!

57
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,708
I think we're witnessing the birth of a
new star here.

58
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,833
but watch the debutant annihilate her.

59
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:03,125
Pogodina can't seem to do
anything about it.

60
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,666
Looks like we have a sensation.

61
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,875
The debutant shamelessly beats the
national team's second-best fencer.

62
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,250
And goes to the Final
to have a face-off with the team's leader.

63
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,708
So, it's the Final.

64
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,083
Our national team's leader
is Alexandra Pokrovskaya.

65
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,583
She's a legendary Sabre fencer.

66
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:37,333
At 34 years old, she's a multi-time World
and European champion.

67
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:42,166
And the only summit she hasnâ€™t been able
to conquer is getting the Olympic gold.

68
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,458
Go on.

69
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:48,500
The highly experienced Pokrovskaya
versus nineteen-year-old Kira Yegorova.

70
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,625
(breathes heavily)

71
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,208
Fence!

72
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:04,000
Pokrovskaya's attack is impeccable. It's
truly textbook stuff.

73
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:06,125
I think this bout's outcome is
as good as determined.

74
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:08,375
You are being way too assumptive here.

75
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,583
Halt!

76
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:29,791
It's three nil for Pokrovskaya. It
exceedingly looks like a wipe-out.

77
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,625
On guard! Ready? Fence!

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Halt!

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,166
Woah-woah-woah!
Yegorova miscalculated her attack

80
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,875
and accidentally hit Pokrovskaya
in the face with her guard.

81
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,291
Let me see.

82
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:54,958
It's alright. I just need to stop the
bleeding, that's all.

83
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,333
She hit through the mask.

84
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:03,000
Is your head hurting? Are you dizzy?
Can you continue?

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,083
U-huh.

86
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,291
Alexandra's courage is certainly
praiseworthy.

87
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,541
It takes a lot to decide to continue
the bout after a hit like that.

88
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:14,208
Fencer on my left, it's the yellow card.

89
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,208
I'm not so sure Yegorova
really deserved this yellow card.

90
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,291
Are you alright?

91
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,125
After all, it was just an accident.

92
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,000
1:3
Yegorova's first hit.

93
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,375
Kira finally opens the score.

94
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:40,125
Wow, an immense speed, just take a look
at her. This girl in on fire.

95
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:45,875
Fence!

96
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,125
Another attack by Yegorova.

97
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,416
It certainly looks like the fall
has thrown Pokrovskaya off her stride.

98
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,833
She finds it hard to get back on track.

99
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,625
That was a hit!
This is the Pokrovskaya we know.

100
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:08,708
Fence!

101
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,666
Just take a look at how one second
has changed everything.

102
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,541
What a fantastic Final.
I've got to say,

103
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,583
watching their face-off
is a real treat.

104
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,333
Fence!

105
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,000
Halt!

106
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:33,291
Well, well, well. This should be
interesting.

107
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,041
Who will the referee give this point to?

108
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,583
Probably no one as the replay clearly
shows that it was a double hit.

109
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,458
Attack from the right. A hit to the left.

110
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:45,125
Hmm. Strangely the point is awarded to
Pokrovskaya.

111
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,833
How's that fair?
It was clearly a double hit.

112
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,416
Was that a point for her
lifetime achievements?

113
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,291
Kira, quit that. Or you'll get a red card.

114
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,875
Left fencer. Mask on.

115
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,125
Experience beat youth, after all.
Pokrovskaya takes the gold.

116
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:27,833
The Final is sure controversial.

117
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,916
Yes, but in terms of how emotionally
charged and intense it was,

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,916
this fight was one of the best I've seen.

119
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,041
Congratulations.

120
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:45,000
Why don't you just
skip the next championship altogether?

121
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,583
They'll give the victory
to you all the same.

122
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,583
Well, it is likely you won't even be at
the next championship

123
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,875
to see it happen with your own eyes.

124
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,541
DAD

125
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,125
Watch where you're going!

126
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,416
What is it that you want?

127
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:34,250
KIRA YEGOROVA

128
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,666
KIRA YEGOROVA 19 YEARS OLD
LEFT-HANDED

129
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,333
Oh, hi, Kira.

130
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,625
Hello. What took you so long?

131
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,541
I'm sorry, they held me back
at the championship.

132
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,833
Where is your medal?

133
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,416
Well, I threw it away, you see.

134
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,083
If you lost, why not just say so?

135
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,875
Will it take you long
to change your clothes?

136
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,041
The swimmers are partying already.
They're waiting for you.

137
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,666
U-huh. I'll go pick a swimsuit, shall I?

138
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:16,833
Kira.

139
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,125
Come on, don't get offended, ok?
I was just kidding.

140
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:25,833
I am not offended. I am just allergic to
chlorine.

141
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,750
How is this my fault?

142
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,791
I am also allergic to morons.

143
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,333
Oh, I see.

144
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,708
If you keep swinging
your Sabre like that,

145
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,916
you'll scare away
all the men around you. U-huh?

146
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,375
Woah-woah-woah. Is that an attack?

147
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,291
Iâ€™ll go see the swim team. You're coming?

148
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,291
No, I don't feel like going.

149
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:58,875
Oooh, well, I sure will go. You see, I'm
not allergic to chlorine, not me.

150
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:01,583
Besides, Semyonov is going to be there.

151
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,500
Be careful or you might get wet too
soon.

152
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,583
Ah. Don't you worry.

153
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,875
Stop staring.

154
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:51,583
Ah! Kostya.

155
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,583
- Sorry.
- You startled me.

156
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:56,000
Considering how quick
your reaction is, I guess

157
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,875
I can almost call it a compliment.
Hello.

158
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,958
Indeed, you're very lucky that my sport
is not boxing.

159
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,083
Yeah.

160
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,500
A good concert?

161
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,833
Well, there was everyone but
Beethoven.

162
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,250
- Uh.
- What's the matter? Let me see.

163
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,083
I cut my finger, that's all. I need a
bandage.

164
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:13,416
Don't tell me you started cooking 'cause
I won't believe it. Here.

165
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,208
Just leave it to me.

166
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,000
I just cut my finger. It's nothing.

167
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,458
Hmmm.

168
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,416
I can do it all myself. Do you mind?

169
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,916
I don't mind. Take it.

170
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,000
Congratulations, you won.

171
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:48,416
Thank you.

172
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,083
This is... What cup number was it?

173
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,375
Seven.

174
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:02,708
I was wondering, why don't they just
give it to you to keep, for good?

175
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,250
Has there finally emerged someone
worthy of a mention in your diary?

176
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,625
Well, who is this girl?

177
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:25,083
This girl right here is someone I almost
lost to today.

178
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:38,166
Is she really that strong? She doesn't
look it though.

179
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,708
If anything, she looks frail.

180
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,791
Maybe it's just me who became weaker.

181
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:50,250
Oh, come on. How many of these girls
did you face throughout your life?

182
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:51,375
I'm not so sure.

183
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,000
She's nineteen years old.

184
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:01,208
Has neither brains nor technique
and just charges at you like mad.

185
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,208
Without even knowing what
her next move will be.

186
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,250
But there was a moment there

187
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,708
when she just started killing me.

188
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,625
A cut then another

189
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:23,208
a cut then another a cut then another.

190
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:41,333
How pretty.

191
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah, I do indeed look just like a zebra
now.

192
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,541
U-huh. A bar-code. A very trendy look.

193
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,625
Damn, I'm sick and tired of people
posting their seaside picks.

194
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,916
That's it, girls, I've realized something.
I want to have a rest.

195
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,666
Why don't you tell Gavrilov about it?

196
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,583
He'll easily organize a seaside and
a good rest for you.

197
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,041
With no right to return
to the national team.

198
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:09,500
By the way, I wonder,
who will go to the Grand Prix?

199
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,750
Alexandra?

200
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,291
-Huh?
-What do you think?

201
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:21,250
In Belgium we'll have a day between
the individual and the team contests.

202
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,416
So what?

203
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,041
What? Chocolate and waffles, of
course.

204
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,500
Aren't you worried that your pants
might tear at the seam?

205
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:30,875
With the training Gavrilov makes us
do? Are you kidding?

206
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:35,083
Gavrilov's coaching someone? I wonder
who got the honor?

207
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:41,708
Halt!

208
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,041
So what? Are you tired?

209
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,541
Not at all, I just warmed up.

210
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,500
So, I suppose, now it's clear who will
go to the competition.

211
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,416
Alright then, let's proceed, shall we?

212
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,666
So, it's the tierce, then the quarte
followed by an advance-lunge, got it?

213
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,833
- U-huh.
- Go on.

214
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,208
What did I just tell you?
Do not attack me, you should parry.

215
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,750
Do not try to be faster than me.

216
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,875
Try to trick me instead.
Understand? Go on then.

217
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:15,125
Halt, halt.

218
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,500
You are too hasty again. There's no need
for you to show me how fast you are.

219
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,791
I already know you're fast.

220
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,291
Understand that we're not playing
whoosh-whoosh-whoosh here.

221
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,958
Here, we are playing jazz.

222
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,333
Can I try again?

223
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:31,583
No, you can't. There are no second
chances here. Certainly not in a fight.

224
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,250
Right, that's enough for today.

225
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:54,500
My greetings to the national
Sabre fencing elite. Congratulations.

226
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,541
The Olympic season was started

227
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,958
with an appalling level of fencing

228
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,291
at the national championship.

229
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,333
As a result,
I've got two bits of news for you.

230
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,125
I'll start with a good one.

231
00:17:09,916 --> 00:17:11,791
No one is expecting us to win.

232
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:16,708
Now it's time for the bad. I am not
taking any tourists to the Olympics.

233
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:19,833
I'll either take there a
team capable of winning it

234
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,125
or I'll simply take no one.

235
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,625
Now, the Olympic race has begun.

236
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:30,833
For some, it's their first time.
Others have already been on this journey.

237
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,708
I hope it won't come as a surprise to you

238
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,791
that this will be a tough journey.

239
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:41,083
Your opponents come with an intention
to take away your victory.

240
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:45,250
I want you to be merciless
when dealing with them.

241
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,958
But first and foremost I want you
to show no mercy to yourselves.

242
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:53,875
Alexandra, catch up with her,
go on.

243
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,000
Halt!

244
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:03,333
Now, put on all of your electric
gear, pair up and proceed to sparring.

245
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:11,541
Today I want you to start
training on the first piste. Right there.

246
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,250
You referee, I'll start.

247
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:52,333
So what, are you going to waste time again
or shall we just start?

248
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,708
It's alright. Today I'll beat you as is.

249
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,791
Ready? Fence!

250
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,083
Ready? Fence!

251
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,333
Look, Sergey, she will injure her
at this rate.

252
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,083
It's okay. Let them figure it out.

253
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,041
Ready? Fence!

254
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,125
Are you alright?

255
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,208
Yes, never better.

256
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,000
Do you want to stop the bout?

257
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:44,666
Let's keep going.

258
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:47,416
Ready?

259
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,416
Fence!

260
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,000
Ready? Fence!

261
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,333
How are you?

262
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,958
Wonderful. That was quite an awesome
training. It's fun here with you.

263
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,000
I mean, how are your wounds?

264
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,916
They are pretty cool scratches.

265
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They are straight, red and they ache â€“
just the way I like it.

266
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:28,541
Now, listen... You can't impress
anyone here with your strong will.

267
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,625
Since this is clearly not
some amateur fencing club.

268
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,291
This is national team.

269
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:40,375
We are a team here. We are more than
just a team though. We're a family.

270
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,833
Right. Some family you are. I just can't
wait to become a part of it.

271
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:51,000
Well, it's not up to you to decide,
but the team.

272
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,291
By the way, you could have
stopped the bout. I did offer you to.

273
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,083
Yeah? And what was the point of your
being there? To look pretty?

274
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,791
Listen, give me this.

275
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,166
You can keep trying to show-off your
strong will for as long as you want.

276
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,666
Yes, hush-hush-hush.
I know it really hurts.

277
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,416
But then make sure
to stock on bandages.

278
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,958
It sounds like a threat.

279
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,250
It sounds the way that
you want to hear it.

280
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:18,000
As for threats, one needs to grow up
before starting to receive them.

281
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:22,625
One might find acting on one's threat
is impossible due to one's old age.

282
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:27,291
Now, listen, little one. Without you
here, weâ€™ll manage perfectly fine.

283
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:30,250
However, without the team
there'll simply be no you.

284
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,500
You won't manage.

285
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,875
And that's why you keep holding on to
each other and to all your accolades.

286
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:38,041
And keep talking about
how your team is your family.

287
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,166
I came here for my victories.

288
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,375
And to achieve my goals I don't need
a team. All I need to win is my Sabre.

289
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,125
Everyone here has a Sabre.

290
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:50,708
And you already saw what they're
capable of.

291
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,250
She moves pretty well, doesn't she?

292
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:27,333
Her speed is the only thing she's got,
actually. Just that, nothing else.

293
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:28,708
You're wrong though.

294
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,333
This girl has a very good instinct.

295
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:39,166
She's a predator. And she knows how to
kill it on the piste.

296
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:42,166
While your killer instinct
has somewhat faded.

297
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,250
Are you actually admiring her, huh?

298
00:22:50,458 --> 00:22:52,125
It's not her we're talking about right
now, it's you.

299
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,250
Hmm.

300
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:56,916
The Olympic season is in full swing.
And you're out of shape.

301
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,708
The Olympic season has only just
begun. I've still got plenty of time.

302
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,083
No, you've got no time at all.

303
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:04,500
And besides, these Olympic games
are going to be your last.

304
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,541
While right now you're - let's
just be honest about it.

305
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:07,625
Alright.

306
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:11,250
Right now, you're much weaker that you
were before the previous Olympic games.

307
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,125
So, how exactly are you
planning to win, huh?

308
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:19,416
However, you could achieve it
with the help of this girl.

309
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:21,083
She's way too impertinent.

310
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:26,250
She's too cocky for the team.
She's way too unruly.

311
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:31,458
Well, that's good she's impertinent.
And it's actually good that she's unruly.

312
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:34,541
A wild and cheeky monkey
is just the one you need.

313
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,583
You've got to learn
to make her play by your rules.

314
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,583
You've got to make her do the work
for you. You are the team leader.

315
00:23:53,583 --> 00:23:56,750
Have you gone completely mad? What
if it did actually hit me?

316
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,750
It didn't hit you though.

317
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,666
Did no one ever tell you it was rude
to look through other people's stuff?

318
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:17,250
Well, in fact, when it comes to parties,
it stops being just your business.

319
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,750
Did you stop to think about me at all?

320
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:19,833
What do you care?

321
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:23,208
I care because the invitation clearly
states it's a plus-one.

322
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:26,125
Alright, it's all yours. Happy now?

323
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:34,875
Well. Kira, I'm sorry. But this plus-one
thing won't work unless you come.

324
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:44,458
Oh wow. You look like a lady.

325
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:49,041
Do you really want me to go there
dressed like this?

326
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,750
Well, if you really don't like
it,

327
00:24:50,833 --> 00:24:53,166
why don't you pick something
from your own clothes?

328
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:58,291
But you should know, that this
is a very expensive dress.

329
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:01,666
I bought it at a sale when the
discount on it was 70 percent.

330
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:05,375
I basically pried it from
the hands of one crone.

331
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:09,375
Wait, what is this thing here? What is
this stain? Did you eat a burger in it?

332
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:14,458
Well, as I've just told you, I bought it
at a sale with a discount and a stain.

333
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,333
That's why it now comes
with a pretty little

334
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:19,083
clutch that you can
use to cover the stain.

335
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,166
Like that.

336
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:44,291
Alexandra Pokrovskaya, the best athlete
of the year.

337
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:47,833
Thank you.

338
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,708
Alexandra, you've got so many awards that
you could open your own Sports Museum.

339
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:57,333
Thank you. Of course I'll strive not to...
become one of the exhibits of this museum.

340
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:02,500
Alexandra, this is a present
from me personally.

341
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:04,458
It's a seventeeth century Spanish sabre.

342
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:07,208
Oh. I'll put it here for now.

343
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:13,166
Thank you.

344
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,083
It's utterly surprising,
isn't it,

345
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:29,041
how a whole life can fit into a twenty-
second-long video clip.

346
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:35,875
I think I would like to add to this video
all the training, injuries and defeats.

347
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,875
Then we'd all have to stay here and
watch the video for twenty years.

348
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,083
Thank you all.

349
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:57,041
I'll go to the table
before it's all cleared out.

350
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:58,291
Do you want
some sparkling wine?

351
00:26:58,375 --> 00:26:59,416
No.

352
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,208
That's a beautiful dress.

353
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,708
You've got a stain on
it lower down there.

354
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:14,000
I just put on the first garment that I
grabbed.

355
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:15,416
But thank you for
this information.

356
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,083
You are welcome.
I understand that it's probably not often

357
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:19,875
that you get to go to
this type of parties.

358
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,708
Strictly speaking it's
an honorary retirement

359
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:23,291
send-off so I wouldn't
call it a party.

360
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:27,875
In fact, I would love to retire, you know.
But there's no worthy successor.

361
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:29,333
Hope you have a great evening.

362
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:32,208
Thank you.

363
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:34,208
â€¦gladlyâ€¦

364
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:39,208
She's such an old bitch.

365
00:27:39,583 --> 00:27:41,083
But she's still very good at fencing.

366
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:42,541
Good job you had no sabres on you

367
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:44,208
otherwise you'd have started
fencing here and now.

368
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,875
My congratulations.

369
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,458
Sure, I'd do it.

370
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:04,375
So, you've decided you want to rock our
little fencing world?

371
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:05,500
No, the world.

372
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,000
Where did a girl like you come from?

373
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:18,125
From Grizovets. Do you have more
interesting places here, in Moscow?

374
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:45,833
I'm terribly hungry now.
Do you have any food?

375
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:50,041
Did you have a fight with a bear?

376
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,875
No. With my teammates over a locker.

377
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:10,083
If I don't eat something right now,
someone will get in trouble.

378
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:11,625
Here's some food for you.

379
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:25,375
Do you ever go anywhere
without your Sabre?

380
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:28,041
Not without this one.

381
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,125
Was it a present?

382
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:31,166
My dad's gift to me.

383
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:33,041
Was it him who got you into fencing?

384
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:36,333
U-huh. He called me D'Artagnan.

385
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,833
Promised me a hairclip.
So I agreed to go.

386
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:44,333
And when I found out you were allowed
to hit people with sabres there,

387
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:47,875
I loved it even more.
Because I was a wild child, you know.

388
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:49,666
And now you've calmed down, is that
right?

389
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:54,583
U-huh. During my first year of fencing
training I would just accost people.

390
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:58,375
I would chase them down the piste
brandishing my Sabre.

391
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:01,625
They would just
disqualify me.

392
00:31:02,458 --> 00:31:05,958
My dad would go argue
with the judgesâ€¦ and defend me.

393
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,708
So, you are your daddy's little girl then?

394
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:12,666
I didn't have much of a choice though.

395
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:17,208
My mom... One morning she
just woke up and suddenly

396
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:20,166
realized that she was
way too good for our little town.

397
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:24,000
She just packed her bags and left.
I never saw her ever again.

398
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:26,958
A daddy's girl is not a bad title though.

399
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:28,041
U-huh.

400
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:32,000
If only he'd stay off the booze.

401
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:37,083
This one's mine.

402
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:42,416
I'm beginning to understand why
Pokrovskaya is so afraid of you.

403
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:33,708
I can slow down a bit.

404
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:41,666
She's got a fast attack. Her high speed
allows her to cut down the distance,

405
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:44,916
her counter-time is always short,

406
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:48,958
one thing she never uses
is compound attacks.

407
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:53,208
Positioning bout is her true weakness,
how do I drag her into it?

408
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,958
One year is not enough to prepare
an inexperienced girl for the Olympics.

409
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:08,166
Gavrilov... what are you playing at?

410
00:33:11,958 --> 00:33:12,958
WORLD CUP PARIS

411
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:15,166
Sheâ€™s the best newcomer
at the World Cup in Orleans.

412
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,750
An up to now unknown Russian fencer
Kira Yegorova makes it to the Final.

413
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,500
Yes! Yes!

414
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,625
It's a resounding victory for Yegorova.

415
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:28,625
What an amazing performance
for a debutante.

416
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:32,041
Alexandra Pokrovskaya,
Russia's national team leader

417
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:35,958
loses to the young Korean Sabre fencer
and is out of the competition.

418
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:43,083
Kira Yegorova bags
a sensational victory

419
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:45,416
for her very first
international competition.

420
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,000
Here, she was already nicknamed
Russian Panther

421
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,875
for her remarkable speed
and rapid attacks.

422
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:59,708
The pace. Keep the pace. Alexandra,
keep up with her. Come on. Keep up.

423
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:03,083
That's slow. Way too slow, Pokrovskaya.

424
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,416
Do you need a ride?

425
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,666
No, thank you. I'm not
that tired actually. I'll walk.

426
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:56,458
Go on. Get in. Or are you scared of me?

427
00:35:05,916 --> 00:35:08,041
You did a very good job in France.

428
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:11,750
A surprisingly good job.

429
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:14,125
- Surprising to whom exactly?
- Everyone.

430
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,833
At your age it's really more...
of a coincidence.

431
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:22,708
So, don't relax just yet.

432
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:24,458
That's right.
I'm not at that age yet

433
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:27,666
where they give you awards
for your lifetime achievements.

434
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:31,916
You know, in this field, your lifetime
achievements are all your victories.

435
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:35,041
Anything else is just cheap popularity.

436
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,583
It must be easy to
philosophize about things

437
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:41,083
when you drive an expensive car
and live on Tverskaya.

438
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,416
It's on Kutuzovsky.

439
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,916
I don't give a monkey's.
You know what though?

440
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,500
I didnâ€™t come all the way here
for no reason, on a whim.

441
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:50,583
I'm going to get what's mine. Trust me.

442
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:55,125
In the professional... sports,
those who just seek perks,

443
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:57,166
are highly unlikely
to stay there long.

444
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:02,333
Stop the car. Iâ€™ll take a subway train.

445
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,625
I've been meaning to ask you...
How expensive is your car?

446
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:23,125
I don't know. It was a gift for my
winning silver at the Olympic Games.

447
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:27,666
Ah! That is, for losing. That's cool, hey?

448
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:54,250
- What?
- What is it you're listening to? Doping?

449
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:55,333
U-huh.

450
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:00,375
You want a dose?

451
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,958
GRAND PRIX
GENEVA

452
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:45,500
I've got to say, you have
a rather aggressive fencing tactics.

453
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:49,125
It would be interesting to know what you
think about when you get on the piste?

454
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:52,375
- To kill the opponent.
- That sounds quite cruel.

455
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:55,833
I don't believe you would accuse
a predator for killing its prey,

456
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,750
now, would you?
It's the same thing here, really.

457
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:20,416
Careful, don't get crushed.

458
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:23,250
It's your fault for winning
so many prizes.

459
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:26,958
Come here.

460
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:29,375
- What for?
- A photoshoot with a star.

461
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:30,500
Oh!

462
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:34,041
Right. Now say cheese.

463
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:42,583
Come here.

464
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:01,833
You know, I've been thinking...

465
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:05,166
How would you like to join me on my tour?

466
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:08,208
We'll arrange a few days' holiday for you.

467
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,208
You'll relax,
we'll finally spend time together.

468
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:14,625
What for? I'm not tired at all actually.

469
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:17,250
I am in great shape.

470
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:20,750
Do you know what nickname
they've given her?

471
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:24,583
Russian Panther.
Everyone's talking about her.

472
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,333
I simply must defeat her.

473
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,416
And what if... you can't do that?

474
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,041
How's that?

475
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,583
Well, you can't
always be number one.

476
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:40,041
Sooner or later there'll come a time
when you'll have to go.

477
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:43,666
U-huh. Yes. I'll have to.
I'll have to go.

478
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:48,833
But I, Alexandra Pokrovskaya,

479
00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:51,583
will decide for myself
when it's time for me to go. Understand?

480
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:54,166
It won't be up to some useless
little punk. Skank.

481
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:55,708
A self-important nobody.

482
00:39:56,833 --> 00:40:00,833
You're a nobody. You're...
She's a nobody.

483
00:40:00,916 --> 00:40:04,458
Do you get it, she's a total...
nobody.

484
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,791
It's only a victory
at the Olympics that truly matters.

485
00:40:07,916 --> 00:40:09,958
And you won't be anywhere near there.
Do you hear me?

486
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,791
She won't even be anywhere near there.

487
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:13,791
Because these are going
to be my Olympic games,

488
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:18,208
and this is my medal, this freaking
gold Olympic medal is mine to take.

489
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:24,166
Alexandra. Hush, hush. Just calm down
please. Please, calm down.

490
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,791
U-huh.

491
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:33,041
This... medal... is just a piece of metal.

492
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:37,791
What's important... is... us.

493
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,458
This piece of metal is...

494
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:44,875
my entire lifeâ€™s goal.
Understand?

495
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:04,208
Hello.

496
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:08,000
Oh! Hello there.

497
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:19,000
Well, hello, Sabre girl. So what...
are you ready to be the cover girl?

498
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:27,250
Moscow Grand Prix is one of the
most important contests of this season.

499
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:29,708
The tension is so thick one
could almost cut it with a knife.

500
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:32,458
Well, it's not surprising really.
The stakes here are just too high.

501
00:43:32,541 --> 00:43:34,583
Today's results will
determine who of the fencers

502
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:36,750
will go to the Olympics
and who'll stay home.

503
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:44,083
Support your daughter
from the bleachers.

504
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:46,083
I'm asking you to put yourself
in my shoes.

505
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:48,875
I simply can't understand why it is
that you won't let me go in there.

506
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:51,541
I'm just here to see my daughter.
Kira Yegorova. She's an athlete

507
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:53,708
here, she's my... I'm her dad,
you see? I just want...

508
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:55,166
I can't go there and call her.

509
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:57,791
Please, show understanding to my
situation, let me in.

510
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:59,250
Phone her on her mobile.

511
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:02,458
You basically took the world of fencing
by storm. Can you reveal your secret?

512
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:03,750
There's no secret at all.

513
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:06,416
All it is, is that I want to win
more than any of my opponents do.

514
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,958
Look, there's your daughter.

515
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:10,708
Is it hard for you to perform today
being this contest's favorite?

516
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:12,208
- No. On the contrary, it's quite nice.
- Kira!

517
00:44:12,291 --> 00:44:13,291
Kira.

518
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:16,000
Well, it's not exactly what I meant to
ask. You are a star now...

519
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:17,666
Kira. Hello.

520
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:24,333
Who knew you had
such strict rules here. Heh.

521
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:26,750
I was telling them,
my daughter is there, I'm her father.

522
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,833
I just want to see her.
That's why I came to Moscow.

523
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,375
What did you come here for? Huh?
Who on earth let you in here?

524
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:36,041
Who did? Well,
a lady came and showed me in. I'm sorry...

525
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:38,791
if I arrived
here at a bad time but...

526
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:40,125
So what?

527
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:42,541
So what? Well,
I just wanted to come and see you.

528
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:45,125
I... just saw you on TV,
there was a news program.

529
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:46,958
And, well,
you know what's happening at home...

530
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:49,375
What did you barge in here for? To beg
me for money, eh?

531
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:53,916
Kira, I... I'm here now... I'm in Moscow,
I've got a job here now.

532
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,625
What do you need Moscow for? What
do you need Moscow for?!

533
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:58,125
Well. I apologize if you are...

534
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:01,750
Here, take this money for the commuter
train ticket just make sure to get lost.

535
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,166
Just get lost, will you!

536
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,916
Kira, why are you like that?

537
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,583
We've reached the Final
where we'll see the fight between

538
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:21,125
our two best female Sabre fencers,
Pokrovskaya and Yegorova.

539
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:22,916
Alexandra looks simply fantastic.

540
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,791
She has in cold blood defeated
all of her opponents one by one.

541
00:45:25,875 --> 00:45:28,000
Kira, on the other hand,
seems to me a bit worked-up.

542
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:30,916
Yes, but I'm sure that Yegorova
will pull herself together in the Final.

543
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,291
Since the winner of this
fight will go to the Olympic games

544
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:35,291
in the rank of
the national team's leader.

545
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:40,708
Kira, didn't your dad stay here to
support you?

546
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:01,000
Pokrovskaya deals the first hit.

547
00:46:04,833 --> 00:46:07,083
Just look at it, Pokrovskaya scores again.

548
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:10,458
So far this fight has been going
according to her plan.

549
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:15,125
I don't understand what's going on.
Kira is simply not herself today.

550
00:46:20,666 --> 00:46:24,250
Yes! There's no way this girl is going to
give up so easily.

551
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:35,208
Pokrovskaya is gaining an advantage.

552
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:38,708
Kira's fencing speed
is simply fascinating.

553
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:41,875
Wow, what an awesome hit.

554
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,750
Wow. Defence and retaliation in a jump.
Great job, Kira.

555
00:46:55,833 --> 00:46:58,250
Finally, we see Kira that we know and
love.

556
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,291
Kira is catching up.
What a great fight this is.

557
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,875
Neither of them wants to give in.

558
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:05,791
Could it really be that Kira will end
up beating Pokrovskaya

559
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:07,958
and taking her place on the throne?

560
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:27,125
Oh, wow. This is truly unfortunate.

561
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:33,791
How are you?

562
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:35,458
My leg.

563
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,375
- Your knee?
- U-huh.

564
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:41,666
- Does this hurt?
- U-huh.

565
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,416
- And now?
- No.

566
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:51,083
Give me the deep freeze spray.

567
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:54,791
Unfortunately, situations like
this often happen in fencing.

568
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:57,375
Regardless of all the
protective clothes the athletes have,

569
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,541
it is still a combat
involving serious weapons.

570
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:03,750
The injury is not too serious,
but I'd recommend playing it safe.

571
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:08,791
If it's nothing serious,
then I will go on.

572
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:17,875
All I can say is, well done,
Yegorova. Despite her injury, she decides

573
00:48:17,958 --> 00:48:20,625
to continue the fight.
That takes a strong will.

574
00:48:41,958 --> 00:48:44,250
En-garde, pret, allez.

575
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:54,625
Well, it looks like her fall is taking
a toll on Yegorova after all.

576
00:48:54,708 --> 00:48:57,458
She's definitely having problems
with her knee.

577
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:18,208
Yes!

578
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:24,541
Alexandra Pokrovskaya wins
this highly important competition.

579
00:49:24,625 --> 00:49:26,625
Now the Olympic Games await her.

580
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:38,458
Unfortunately Kira couldn't
overcome the consequences of her fall.

581
00:49:38,541 --> 00:49:42,083
Yes. While Pokovskaya has once
again proven that she is not going to give

582
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:43,916
her throne to anyone without a fight.

583
00:49:58,375 --> 00:50:03,750
Oh well... your ligament is
ruptured. That's a nasty injury.

584
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,625
Alright then.
You'll need physiotherapy for a while.

585
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:11,875
Yes, I got that part but when
can I resume my training?

586
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:15,000
I need to prepare for a
competition that's in two weeks.

587
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,041
Kira, you didn't get me...

588
00:50:21,125 --> 00:50:24,833
You'll need three months for the
injury to fully heal. At the very least.

589
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:28,375
This season is over for you, Kira.

590
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:32,000
Wait, what? It's not over.

591
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:34,666
It just makes no sense.
I don't even feel any pain at all.

592
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:38,083
Of course, you donâ€™t. But just
because you've taken painkillers.

593
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:46,583
Take one every morning and evening. We'll
start with these and see how it goes.

594
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:50,333
I don't need these pills,
I'm totally healthy.

595
00:50:52,791 --> 00:50:57,416
Listen to me, Kira. Right now,
any sharp movement that you make,

596
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,375
can cause your ligament
to tear completely.

597
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:03,041
And then you'll need a
surgery. The best case scenario?

598
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:06,916
Your career just ends.

599
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,583
What you need right now is just to calm
down and have some rest.

600
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,083
And later on we will
think of some solution.

601
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:29,458
I need to be at my training.

602
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:32,041
Didn't you hear what
the doctor just told you?

603
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:34,416
Don't you understand that you
can develop a permanent limp?

604
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,291
I don't give a monkey's.
To get to the games,

605
00:51:36,375 --> 00:51:39,083
Iâ€™ve been swinging my Sabre
in a lousy sports hall since I was eight!

606
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:41,333
The winning place is mine! I won't
give it up to anyone.

607
00:51:41,416 --> 00:51:43,458
- Do you understand?
- Listen, what are you stupid?

608
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:48,750
Right, I'm already running late for my
training.

609
00:51:48,833 --> 00:51:52,166
Look, I'm sorry. Please, wait.
That's not how I meant it, you know.

610
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,416
Everythingâ€™s fine.

611
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:57,125
Kira, listen. Could you just
calm down a bit, please?

612
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:59,583
But I am calm. Let go.

613
00:52:24,583 --> 00:52:26,458
- Are you leaving right now?
- Yes.

614
00:52:28,208 --> 00:52:32,833
I don't know how I forgot that it
was today. The time just really flies.

615
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:42,666
Would you like me to
drive you to the airport?

616
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,625
No, don't bother. I've called a taxi.

617
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:47,708
Hm.

618
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:04,083
Hmm. Thank you.

619
00:53:04,416 --> 00:53:05,458
Look, Kostya.

620
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:10,750
I understand that Iâ€™ve
always been a difficult person.

621
00:53:11,833 --> 00:53:13,666
Especially lately, to be fair.

622
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:16,500
You have never been like this before.

623
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:21,458
What do you expect? I simply had
to fight for the right to keep my place.

624
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:24,083
There is just no other choice.

625
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,625
Well, I believe...

626
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:30,083
one should remain a good
person no matter what.

627
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,041
Is that right?

628
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,833
Well, it's easy for you to say, you know.

629
00:53:36,916 --> 00:53:40,750
You don't have to fight to keep your place
as the first violin in the orchestra.

630
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:54,916
Keep your hand steady!

631
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:00,500
Oh! Yegorova. Hello.

632
00:54:01,208 --> 00:54:02,291
Hello.

633
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:04,708
How are you?

634
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,250
I'm okay.

635
00:54:06,958 --> 00:54:09,708
That's good news,
I'm glad for you. Now go do the work.

636
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:11,750
Vasily Ivanovich there is free.

637
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:17,750
Come on, come on, everyone, keep
training, go on.

638
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:38,541
Halt, Yegorova.

639
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,750
Are you sure you're alright?

640
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:51,916
Come on,
letâ€™s go get on the piste.

641
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:08,750
Inside cut with a
lunge. Parry of prime.

642
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:13,291
Then, riposte with cut at
the right flank. Understood?

643
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:29,541
Itâ€™ll be fine now.

644
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:36,750
You've got a ligament rupture. It will
take it at least three months to be fine.

645
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:39,791
And that's when
you should return.

646
00:55:40,166 --> 00:55:42,041
Can I, please, give it another go?

647
00:55:42,125 --> 00:55:45,541
Didn't I tell you,
nobody gets any second chances in here.

648
00:55:48,208 --> 00:55:51,541
Right, everyone else,
get back to your training, come on.

649
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:29,208
Aren't you sick and tired already
of Gavrilov's tyrannical ways?

650
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,083
Well then,
why didn't you tell it to his face?

651
00:56:32,958 --> 00:56:35,250
Everyone's brave in the locker room.

652
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:40,458
Alexandra could have said something
since she's our team's captain.

653
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:45,250
We don't have any team to talk about.
We're all on our own here.

654
00:57:42,666 --> 00:57:44,083
So what, let's proceed?

655
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:45,208
U-huh.

656
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:49,708
Come on, as always.

657
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,541
Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, wait a minute.

658
00:57:58,958 --> 00:58:00,500
Is there a problem, hey?

659
00:58:02,666 --> 00:58:06,125
I got distracted. Everything's fine.

660
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:10,458
Alexandra, having trained you for
twenty-five years, I can tell by your hits

661
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:13,583
what you've had for breakfast
so don't tell me everything's fine.

662
00:58:17,458 --> 00:58:18,833
It was me who broke her.

663
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:22,041
Oh, I see.

664
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:28,916
It was a fight.
And you defeated her in it.

665
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,916
I just went and pushed her off the piste.
You did see that!

666
00:58:34,041 --> 00:58:35,125
So I did.

667
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:40,458
Listen, you've worked so
hard to get where you are now.

668
00:58:40,541 --> 00:58:42,666
As a result,
you're at the top of your game now.

669
00:58:42,708 --> 00:58:46,416
You've become much stronger.
Your instinct has finally awoken.

670
00:58:51,375 --> 00:58:53,000
Well, what did you expect?

671
00:58:53,333 --> 00:58:57,208
Did you want to become strong but
also remain nice at the same time?

672
00:58:57,291 --> 00:59:01,000
That's just not how it works.
Everything in life has its price.

673
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:04,250
So, quit complaining.
And thinking of others.

674
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:08,083
Right now, there's just you and your
future win at the Olympic Games.

675
00:59:08,166 --> 00:59:09,708
Or am I being wrong here?

676
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:24,208
On guard.

677
00:59:27,333 --> 00:59:28,541
When you do it like this,
it really suits you.

678
00:59:28,625 --> 00:59:29,791
- Like this?
- U-huh.

679
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:40,416
You've got about half an hour
to change your mind

680
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,750
and thus avoid completely
merging with this bed.

681
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:53,750
Hello.

682
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:09,541
You should have warned we that you'd come,

683
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:11,625
then I would put on some
make-up and a dress.

684
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:17,083
It's fine like this.
Can't you bend your leg at all?

685
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:21,875
Should I, maybe,
wag my tail for you as well?

686
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:27,583
If this is weighing on your conscience,
you can just apologize and get lost.

687
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:31,666
I do believe you realize that fencing is
very different from ball room dancing.

688
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:33,958
People get much more
serious injuries here.

689
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:37,041
Well, you can go back to
your room and pity yourself.

690
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:43,208
You still have a chance
to rejoin our national team.

691
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,541
Gavrilov doesn't
give second chances.

692
01:00:49,458 --> 01:00:53,000
It's fine, I'll get over it. It
could happen to anybody.

693
01:00:53,125 --> 01:00:55,625
You're not just anybody, you know
that yourself.

694
01:00:55,791 --> 01:00:57,083
What you need is to keep training.

695
01:00:57,166 --> 01:01:00,833
How? I feel pain just
getting out of my bed.

696
01:01:06,791 --> 01:01:08,291
I will help you with it.

697
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:14,250
You can go and stick
your help you know where.

698
01:01:23,125 --> 01:01:25,000
-Let down your hair.
-Like this?

699
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,250
Hey, wait for me there.
I'll quickly get ready.

700
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:08,208
So what, I thought it was really cool.

701
01:03:08,291 --> 01:03:10,916
- Yes, it was.
- How about going to our place?

702
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,250
- Nuh, guys, let's not.
- Oh, come on.

703
01:03:13,333 --> 01:03:16,666
- The girls must be wondering where I am.
- Weâ€™ll get some alcohol, it will be cool.

704
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:20,291
Hands off. Alright, guys, it's been fun
partying with you, but I'll go home now.

705
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:22,916
- Hey, give me a kiss.
- Hey now, what do you think you're doing?

706
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,041
That's it, calm down.
I said, get your hands off me.

707
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:27,708
- Calm down.
- I said, get your hands off me!

708
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,000
Shut up!

709
01:03:31,916 --> 01:03:33,083
Shut up you bitch!

710
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:38,125
Shut up!

711
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:47,208
I told you to calm down.

712
01:03:49,916 --> 01:03:52,625
Listen to me, you bitch,
if you put up a fight...

713
01:04:48,541 --> 01:04:50,375
I'm ready to resume training.

714
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:53,083
What has happened?

715
01:04:54,166 --> 01:04:57,458
You gave me your promise that you'll help
me with it. I'm going to keep training.

716
01:04:57,541 --> 01:04:58,875
Do you understand me?

717
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:15,333
Here, hold this.

718
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:29,416
Here... it's here that I've
trained throughout my childhood.

719
01:06:40,916 --> 01:06:42,541
Rock-n-Roll's hall of fame?

720
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:02,125
Right, first of all... you need to
learn how to go easy on yourself.

721
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:06,250
There's no one here you need to impress.
And you could easily tear your ligaments.

722
01:07:06,333 --> 01:07:08,125
You sure know how to pep-talk.

723
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:11,458
Is it psychological support that you
need or shall we start training already?

724
01:07:11,541 --> 01:07:13,458
I wonder what you're capable of.

725
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:16,333
I sure can hold a Sabre in my hands.

726
01:07:18,791 --> 01:07:22,250
Wonderful. Now all you
need is just to learn to fence.

727
01:07:27,458 --> 01:07:31,416
Get comfortable. This will be your
workplace for the following month.

728
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,833
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely.

729
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:46,833
I need to find out whether Russian
Panther knows how to defend herself.

730
01:07:47,083 --> 01:07:49,416
Are you scared that I might bite you?

731
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:26,500
Are you okay?

732
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:28,625
We should proceed.

733
01:08:35,875 --> 01:08:37,750
I don't need any of it.

734
01:08:37,833 --> 01:08:41,000
Do you want to know if I can defend
myself? I can't do anything anymore.

735
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:43,416
Got it? I can't do
anything anymore!

736
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:48,375
Is that all?
Now listen to what I will say.

737
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,291
I'm not here to pity you
or be a shoulder to cry on.

738
01:08:52,375 --> 01:08:55,000
All fencers get injured and
keep fighting through the pain.

739
01:08:55,083 --> 01:08:58,791
So just get used to it.
Either that or, if not, then just leave.

740
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:35,375
On guard.

741
01:09:41,666 --> 01:09:45,833
You must adapt to your injury. You
must completely change who you are.

742
01:09:46,666 --> 01:09:51,125
Pain is a good thing. It helps discard
irrelevant thoughts and be more focused.

743
01:09:51,208 --> 01:09:54,000
You must learn to use
this pain to your advantage.

744
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,041
You won't be able to
jump like you did before.

745
01:09:58,125 --> 01:10:00,333
So, you'll need
to alter your fencing style.

746
01:10:00,416 --> 01:10:02,208
And this is akin to
learning to walk again.

747
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:04,166
But this is your only chance.

748
01:10:28,458 --> 01:10:31,541
To win, you don't need to be
stronger or faster than your opponent.

749
01:10:31,625 --> 01:10:34,916
What you need is to be smarter.
You must trick your opponent.

750
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,666
Make them believe that you're weak.
Fencing is about trickery.

751
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:42,291
Trick everyone else and
don't let them trick you.

752
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:12,375
Hello.

753
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:19,458
Hi there. What are you doing here at
this late hour?

754
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:20,875
And you?

755
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,125
- We are training here.
- Can we have your autograph?

756
01:11:27,041 --> 01:11:30,791
On the condition that you won't tell
anyone that you saw us here. - Come on.

757
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:32,958
Alexandra.

758
01:11:37,833 --> 01:11:39,833
- Take it. - Thanks a lot.
-Dasha.

759
01:11:42,541 --> 01:11:44,750
- Will you sign it for me too?
- Okay.

760
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:47,375
Why did you have to tie her up here?

761
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:53,708
She wouldn't listen to adults.
So she needed to be disciplined.

762
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:55,625
So cool.

763
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:03,791
We'll be rooting for you
at the Olympic Games.

764
01:12:40,041 --> 01:12:42,833
Do you still remember
your first Olympic Games?

765
01:12:47,666 --> 01:12:49,166
All that was so long ago.

766
01:12:50,416 --> 01:12:54,583
So much so that back then, Russian Panther
was knee-high to a grasshopper.

767
01:12:55,125 --> 01:12:59,250
Seriously... what's so special about
the Olympics? I don't understand.

768
01:13:00,166 --> 01:13:04,750
Well... The Olympic games,
they're like...

769
01:13:06,208 --> 01:13:07,250
Mount Everest.

770
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:13,833
Everybody wants to conquer that
summit but main thing is to make it there.

771
01:13:14,958 --> 01:13:18,916
I know about Everest. I have read...
there're all these corpses.

772
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:23,208
They lie there frozen and nobody
even remembers their names.

773
01:13:25,041 --> 01:13:27,000
Yeah. It's the same
with the Olympics.

774
01:13:27,958 --> 01:13:29,625
They only remember champions.

775
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:32,750
This is quite sad. Also, not helpful.

776
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:37,208
It never gets any easier.

777
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:44,875
When I first started up in fencing,
in the beginning,

778
01:13:46,083 --> 01:13:48,208
I was too afraid
to touch a Sabre.

779
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:51,458
And of course I wouldn't dream of
hitting an opponent with that thing.

780
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:52,875
- What? No way.
- Yes.

781
01:13:53,708 --> 01:13:57,000
Gavrilov even wanted to make me
leave. He'd say, 'If you can't hit anyone,

782
01:13:57,083 --> 01:13:59,083
why don't you go to
the class next door

783
01:13:59,166 --> 01:14:01,458
and learn gymnastics
instead and do splits'.

784
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:06,208
But I would return every day.

785
01:14:06,916 --> 01:14:08,791
And every day Gavrilov
kept on telling me,

786
01:14:08,875 --> 01:14:11,541
'You're not the right
monkey for this sport.

787
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:15,833
So, why are you here?
You are not going to succeed in it.

788
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:19,750
I would cry my eyes
out after each training.

789
01:14:23,666 --> 01:14:25,666
So why didn't you leave back then?

790
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:28,166
Because I am very stubborn.

791
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:35,791
And you're just like that.

792
01:14:45,041 --> 01:14:46,166
So, it's Everest?

793
01:15:15,166 --> 01:15:19,833
Alexandra, can you explain it to me...
what for?

794
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:28,083
It was my idea, I asked her to.

795
01:15:29,583 --> 01:15:30,666
You?

796
01:15:37,333 --> 01:15:42,250
Did your mentor explain to you the reason
why I took you on the national team?

797
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:44,875
No?

798
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:49,666
I only ever took you on
the team so that Alexandra

799
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:53,500
could have a sparring partner so
that she would become stronger.

800
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:59,833
You happened to be perfect for that
role. A wild and talented little monkey.

801
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:04,625
Of course, you could have made it to the
Olympic Games, but then you got injured.

802
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:06,708
That's unlucky.
These things happen.

803
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:09,750
So... That's it,
you've played your part here.

804
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,041
Is that yours?

805
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,166
Alexandra. So,
you haven't actually answered my question.

806
01:16:40,125 --> 01:16:41,208
What for?

807
01:16:42,708 --> 01:16:47,416
If only you knew just how much I hate all
these talks of yours about monkeys, huh.

808
01:16:48,541 --> 01:16:52,291
My whole life I've been the most
obedient little monkey for you.

809
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:59,875
Do you remember what I
told you when you came to me

810
01:16:59,958 --> 01:17:02,708
as a little girl and asked to
teach you how to fence?

811
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,041
Yes.

812
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:09,583
Do you remember what your reply was?

813
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,833
- I'd do whatever it takes.
- What else?

814
01:17:16,875 --> 01:17:19,416
- That I'll do whatever it takes.
- What else?

815
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:24,125
I said, I was ready to be a bad person.

816
01:17:25,625 --> 01:17:28,375
That. Your problem, Alexandra,

817
01:17:28,458 --> 01:17:32,083
is that you're constantly trying
to be good for everyone.

818
01:17:33,208 --> 01:17:36,791
To be kind. Being a good person
is not a profession though.

819
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:41,583
People don't win Olympic games by
being kind-hearted. This doesn't happen.

820
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:44,833
Understand that this girl still
has her whole life ahead of her.

821
01:17:44,916 --> 01:17:47,041
But for you this is
the very last chance.

822
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:49,708
These will be your very
last Olympic Games.

823
01:17:51,666 --> 01:17:53,875
Yes. It is indeed my last chance. Yes.

824
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,625
And, trust me,
I am actually going to take it.

825
01:17:56,708 --> 01:18:01,458
But the way I want to do it. With dignity.
So that I don't feel ashamed later.

826
01:18:01,625 --> 01:18:04,041
Ashamed is what you'll
be when years from now

827
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:06,250
you'll be retired and
telling your grandchildren

828
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:09,875
about the time when you had your very
last Olympics and you failed to win it.

829
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:02,666
It's been a while since you and I
had a meal together.

830
01:19:04,708 --> 01:19:07,500
I never fed you something as awful as
this junk food.

831
01:19:07,541 --> 01:19:11,416
Do you remember when... you made
soup for me for the first time?

832
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:16,166
That time I... put way
too much pepper into it.

833
01:19:18,083 --> 01:19:20,541
- It was all pepper.
- I took it stoically.

834
01:19:26,458 --> 01:19:28,125
Dad, let's just go back home.

835
01:19:28,875 --> 01:19:31,458
Who needs this Moscow
or the national team?

836
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:34,958
Let's just live like
all normal people do.

837
01:19:36,791 --> 01:19:37,875
Let's go then.

838
01:19:39,333 --> 01:19:42,083
I bet... I can find work
in our Grizovets too.

839
01:19:43,166 --> 01:19:44,458
They've got a factory.

840
01:19:44,541 --> 01:19:48,125
We'll go for barbeques in the pine grove
just like we did before.

841
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:54,083
Just don't get rid of your Sabre,
alright?

842
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:59,291
We'll use it as a skewer to put meat on.

843
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,708
Aren't you ashamed to be mocking your
daughter like that?

844
01:20:04,791 --> 01:20:07,666
Aren't you ashamed to be
saying such utter nonsense?

845
01:20:07,916 --> 01:20:11,125
'Who cares about this Olympics?
Who cares about this Olympics!'

846
01:20:11,208 --> 01:20:15,291
Was it in vain that I sacrificed my sleep
on weekends to take to your trainings?

847
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:17,000
Actually, I went there by myself.

848
01:20:17,083 --> 01:20:19,250
Thatâ€™s more reason to be ashamed now.

849
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
And by the way,
I... have started saving money now.

850
01:20:26,708 --> 01:20:29,791
To be able to afford going
to your first ever Olympics.

851
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:39,833
You're my D'Artagnan.

852
01:20:58,750 --> 01:20:59,791
Well.

853
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:04,916
What are you standing?
Start the warm-up.

854
01:21:10,541 --> 01:21:11,791
Oh! Look, who's here.

855
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:16,416
Mademoiselle Yegorova.
Is there something you want?

856
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,583
It's just that we have
a national team's training now.

857
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:21,666
And you're standing here,
looking reproachful.

858
01:21:22,125 --> 01:21:25,333
Yes. I want to prove
that this place is mine.

859
01:21:27,208 --> 01:21:28,750
Yeah? That's interesting.

860
01:21:29,875 --> 01:21:34,333
Alone on the piste, with no partner?
I'm afraid that's not possible.

861
01:21:38,833 --> 01:21:40,125
I'll be her partner.

862
01:22:23,041 --> 01:22:26,875
Well, what can I say to that, Alexandra.
What a fantastic performance.

863
01:22:29,583 --> 01:22:33,458
But if it's alright with you,
I'd like to continue our training.

864
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:38,083
Come on. Well, ladies,
approach your targets.

865
01:23:27,666 --> 01:23:28,666
Right.

866
01:23:41,833 --> 01:23:43,833
OLYMPIC GAMES
RIO DE JANEIRO

867
01:23:44,875 --> 01:23:47,625
Kira, donâ€™t you run a risk by coming here,
by coming here,

868
01:23:47,708 --> 01:23:50,375
to the Olympics with an
injury that hasnâ€™t fully healed?

869
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:53,625
I am totally fine.

870
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:56,833
Actually,
I think you are risking even more

871
01:23:56,916 --> 01:23:59,250
trying to tease
the world-famous Russian Panther.

872
01:23:59,541 --> 01:24:04,416
Okay, the last thing I would wanna do is
to tease the world-famous Russian Panther.

873
01:24:04,666 --> 01:24:08,000
But if itâ€™s all the same to you,
Iâ€™d like Kira to answer the question.

874
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:10,833
How did you manage
to recover so quickly?

875
01:24:12,625 --> 01:24:15,958
That's all thanks to the fact that we've
got the best healthcare in the world.

876
01:24:16,041 --> 01:24:17,041
Okay.

877
01:24:18,666 --> 01:24:21,708
Your team had a pretty tough season.

878
01:24:21,791 --> 01:24:25,458
Problems with injuries and team line-up.
Has it been hard in this situation

879
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:28,000
to motivate the team
to stay focused on winning?

880
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:32,583
No, it hasn't. These are Russian women.

881
01:24:33,166 --> 01:24:35,250
If they lack anything,
it's definitely not motivation.

882
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:36,458
I see.

883
01:24:37,583 --> 01:24:38,625
Kira!

884
01:24:45,583 --> 01:24:48,000
You did very well back there. Awesome job.

885
01:24:50,416 --> 01:24:52,666
You helped me quite a bit too. Thank
you.

886
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:58,416
So, you got what you wanted, then.
You're at the Olympic Games.

887
01:24:59,791 --> 01:25:02,666
Yes. Even though many doubted I would.

888
01:25:03,291 --> 01:25:06,625
I didn't doubt it.
It's just that I was worried for you.

889
01:25:07,041 --> 01:25:09,208
I didn't want you to run such risks.

890
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:13,166
I will be rooting for you.

891
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:45,500
This is the biggest moment in an
athleteâ€™s life. This is the Olympics.

892
01:25:45,666 --> 01:25:48,541
This is the summit that someone
will conquer today.

893
01:25:48,625 --> 01:25:51,208
This is the strongest competition line-up
in my memory.

894
01:25:56,333 --> 01:26:00,041
Excuse me, please. Could we switch
the channel to women's fencing?

895
01:26:00,125 --> 01:26:01,458
Huh? Switch to what?

896
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:06,583
Guys, his wife is performing
at the Olympics.

897
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:13,916
Yes, we're expecting
today to be very tense.

898
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,625
The strongest Sabre fencers will be
fighting for the right to go to the Final.

899
01:26:17,666 --> 01:26:21,208
Nina Pogodina, Kira Yegorova,
Alexandra Pokrovskaya.

900
01:26:21,666 --> 01:26:24,333
Today we have to support
all of our female athletes.

901
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:27,791
There are no opponents among them.
They'll be fighting there for us.

902
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:32,333
Pokrovskaya is a true legend
of Russia's national team.

903
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,083
Well done you.

904
01:26:40,583 --> 01:26:43,916
From the get-go, in the very first bout
she's showing off her fantastic skill.

905
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,916
Yes, Pokrovskaya's
confident attacks

906
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,791
leave us no doubt regarding
her ultimate goal of coming here.

907
01:26:48,833 --> 01:26:50,916
She won't settle for anything
less than Olympic gold.

908
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,375
Kira Yegorova. She is that very girl
who recently took

909
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:56,666
the world of fencing by storm
and has already managed to stir things up.

910
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:08,750
Kira looks very confident.

911
01:27:12,833 --> 01:27:14,375
Victory goes to Kira Yegorova!

912
01:27:14,458 --> 01:27:15,458
Yes!

913
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:19,250
Russian Sabre fencers
are performing remarkably.

914
01:27:19,375 --> 01:27:22,416
If that's their coach's strategy,
he must be ingenious.

915
01:27:23,625 --> 01:27:24,833
Good job, Alexandra.

916
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:32,166
Look at that! The Russian Panther
keeps winning on one leg.

917
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:35,791
As the saying goes,
a wounded animal is very dangerous.

918
01:27:37,375 --> 01:27:40,333
Pogodina makes an unfortunate mistake
in the second half of the bout.

919
01:27:40,416 --> 01:27:43,416
Sadly, it means the end
of these Olympic Games for her.

920
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,000
The Russians suffer
their first losses,

921
01:27:47,083 --> 01:27:49,458
while they still have their main
opponents to look forward to.

922
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:51,375
I wonder, can anybody stop them?

923
01:27:53,041 --> 01:27:55,291
Well, we've made it
to the semifinals.

924
01:27:55,541 --> 01:27:57,708
Here, Pokrovskaya will face
the legendary de Galier.

925
01:27:57,750 --> 01:28:00,833
It was her who snatched the gold from
Alexandra at the previous Olympic Games.

926
01:28:00,916 --> 01:28:04,875
De Galier is in impeccable form.
She is the World Champion

927
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:08,541
and the main contestant for the victory.
And sheâ€™s got a lot of confidence.

928
01:28:08,625 --> 01:28:12,166
Pokrovskaya has no chance.
This will be the end of her story.

929
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:17,750
De Galier deals a blow.

930
01:28:18,625 --> 01:28:21,208
Sooner or later Russiaâ€™s
luck had to run out.

931
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:31,333
Alexandra's main task now is
to control her emotions.

932
01:28:39,791 --> 01:28:43,000
Pokrovskaya is taking a pause
after the first period.

933
01:28:46,833 --> 01:28:49,708
Why are you afraid of her?
Stop overthinking it.

934
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
- I can't.
- But you have to.

935
01:28:52,458 --> 01:28:54,541
Break through this barrier.
Just smash through it.

936
01:28:54,625 --> 01:28:57,166
If you're losing, just keep going.
You got it? I can't hear you.

937
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:58,291
I got it!

938
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,916
And move smoother. Come on. Do it.

939
01:29:13,291 --> 01:29:15,333
Look at that, Pokrovskaya is now angry.

940
01:29:15,416 --> 01:29:16,416
Good.

941
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:18,791
Yes!

942
01:29:18,875 --> 01:29:21,708
Yes! Pokrovskaya is catching up
to her opponent!

943
01:29:22,916 --> 01:29:24,083
A hit by de Galier.

944
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:28,208
And by Pokrovskaya again.

945
01:29:28,291 --> 01:29:30,041
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

946
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:36,333
It's a win!

947
01:29:36,416 --> 01:29:38,875
That's amazing.
The bout seemed as good as lost.

948
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:42,125
But Alexandra by some miracle managed
to change the tides and won the fight.

949
01:29:42,208 --> 01:29:45,833
What an incredible bout that was.
Pokrovskaya goes to the Final.

950
01:29:45,916 --> 01:29:48,250
Indeed, Pokrovskaya
is a remarkable fencer.

951
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:53,291
Russia! Russia! Russia! Russia!

952
01:29:53,750 --> 01:29:57,666
That's it. Well done! Well done you!
You beauty!

953
01:29:57,916 --> 01:30:00,208
- I actually beat her!
- You beat her beautifully.

954
01:30:00,291 --> 01:30:03,333
Right. Go have a rest.
Restore your energy for the next fight.

955
01:30:09,916 --> 01:30:12,916
Alexandra. You really need to stop...
overthinking it.

956
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,416
- U-huh.
- Do you hear me?

957
01:30:16,708 --> 01:30:20,375
U-huh. In just fifteen cuts
you'll become an Olympic champion.

958
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:22,583
Do you hear me?
Fifteen cuts, Alexandra.

959
01:30:39,958 --> 01:30:43,958
You let in way too many of her hits.
It's all because you just barge forward.

960
01:30:44,041 --> 01:30:45,833
Without watching your opponent.

961
01:30:45,916 --> 01:30:48,208
What else? Why don't you
just tie me to the piste?

962
01:30:48,333 --> 01:30:49,500
I would if I could.

963
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:54,166
Ok now, listen to me.

964
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:56,500
I know this fencer.

965
01:30:56,916 --> 01:31:00,416
She's going to provoke you.
It's crucial that you stay calm.

966
01:31:01,166 --> 01:31:03,666
And just keep doing what we've practiced.

967
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:05,916
Focus on her torso, and pay attention.

968
01:31:07,875 --> 01:31:12,458
Kira will be fighting an experienced
Sabre fencer from South Korea Kin Gan Xin.

969
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:17,125
Before Yegorova came into picture,

970
01:31:17,208 --> 01:31:19,583
Xin was deemed the fastest
female Sabre fencer.

971
01:31:26,291 --> 01:31:27,916
Xin scores the first point.

972
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:36,333
Yegorova keeps getting hit
again and again.

973
01:31:38,875 --> 01:31:40,250
Yes! Yegorova scores.

974
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:46,166
Don't you take your eyes off her.

975
01:31:46,708 --> 01:31:48,375
Xin prevents Kira from catching up.

976
01:31:48,666 --> 01:31:49,708
Come on, come on.

977
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:04,541
It's a shame that Yegorova's injury
stops her from giving it her all.

978
01:32:05,166 --> 01:32:08,291
I don't get how they let her perform
in the Olympics if her knee's injured?

979
01:32:08,375 --> 01:32:11,208
Because it's different from your
football where a slightest touch

980
01:32:11,291 --> 01:32:13,291
makes you fall down on the
ground and start crying.

981
01:32:13,583 --> 01:32:15,625
Kira now has a short pause to regroup.

982
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:24,416
Calm yourself down.
Just take a good look at her.

983
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:45,625
And she scores.

984
01:32:49,833 --> 01:32:50,875
Yes!

985
01:32:50,958 --> 01:32:53,041
Now this is the Russian
Panther we know and love.

986
01:32:54,083 --> 01:32:55,375
Attack her. Attack her.

987
01:32:56,166 --> 01:32:59,125
Yegorova is on a roll.
Nobody can stop her now.

988
01:33:02,041 --> 01:33:03,041
Yes!

989
01:33:04,666 --> 01:33:05,666
Yes!

990
01:33:06,541 --> 01:33:07,666
Yes!

991
01:33:07,750 --> 01:33:12,208
You can call it whatever you like:
a big surprise, pure luck, a coincidence.

992
01:33:12,291 --> 01:33:14,208
But she did it.

993
01:33:14,458 --> 01:33:17,416
Now this nineteen-year-old
girl from the town of Grizovets

994
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,666
is in the Olympic Games final.

995
01:33:40,416 --> 01:33:44,041
It is common for athletes to be
dissatisfied with their coaches.

996
01:33:44,291 --> 01:33:46,833
They consider them bad. That's inevitable.

997
01:33:47,833 --> 01:33:49,416
And I'm ready for that...

998
01:33:52,625 --> 01:33:55,708
But I just want you to know
that all I've ever done...

999
01:33:55,958 --> 01:33:58,458
I've done it for the sake of your victory.

1000
01:34:02,375 --> 01:34:06,625
You're a fighter. You know it yourself
there can be no friends on the piste.

1001
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:09,875
The piste is the place
for just one thing and it's the fight.

1002
01:34:09,958 --> 01:34:12,500
It's quite simple:
either kill or be killed.

1003
01:34:16,166 --> 01:34:18,791
I am begging you, please,
just switch off your feelings.

1004
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:20,500
And switch on your instinct.

1005
01:34:21,875 --> 01:34:25,666
Remember what you were like
when you defeated her in that fight.

1006
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:27,708
This Olympics is yours, Alexandra.

1007
01:34:28,208 --> 01:34:29,333
And you must win it.

1008
01:34:49,041 --> 01:34:53,875
So, it's the Olympic Games Final.
And it's going to be Russian.

1009
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:57,250
Yes, these are Alexandra
Pokrovskaya and Kira Yegorova

1010
01:34:57,333 --> 01:35:00,416
who will fight for the title
of the Olympic champion.

1011
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:02,791
Thank you.

1012
01:35:14,333 --> 01:35:19,125
Words simply can't describe it.
Everyone is so excited to see the Final.

1013
01:35:19,375 --> 01:35:23,375
Regardless of this fight's outcome,
it will definitely make history.

1014
01:35:24,916 --> 01:35:28,666
And look, the coach of Russian Sabre
fencers goes and sits in the audience.

1015
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:30,666
I suppose, it's the only right choice.

1016
01:35:30,750 --> 01:35:34,708
It's up to Pokrovskaya and Yegorova now
to decide which of them is the best.

1017
01:35:35,541 --> 01:35:36,708
Go on, girl.

1018
01:35:38,375 --> 01:35:41,000
Thanks to all the drama of this fight,
for one day,

1019
01:35:41,083 --> 01:35:43,958
sabre fencing has become
the most popular Olympic sport.

1020
01:35:44,916 --> 01:35:48,666
The entire world is waiting to see the
outcome of this face-off.

1021
01:35:49,208 --> 01:35:52,500
Wow, who would have thought
Iâ€™d root for Russians so much!

1022
01:35:58,291 --> 01:36:00,000
Can I have some water please?

1023
01:36:26,541 --> 01:36:29,125
Yes, it really looks like it's going
to be a very difficult fight

1024
01:36:29,208 --> 01:36:32,708
and most of all emotionally difficult.
There's no 'us' and 'them' here.

1025
01:36:32,791 --> 01:36:35,250
Both of the fencers
are certainly worthy of this victory.

1026
01:36:54,916 --> 01:36:55,916
Yes!

1027
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,416
Yes!

1028
01:36:59,291 --> 01:37:01,500
So, it's Pokrovskaya who scores first.

1029
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:09,125
Pokrovskaya is off
to a very confident start:

1030
01:37:09,208 --> 01:37:10,583
her experience really shows.

1031
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:22,375
Meanwhile, Yegorova is not her usual self.
As she lets in the third cut in a row.

1032
01:37:22,458 --> 01:37:25,916
Yes, but Alexandra too seems
to be unhappy. What's going on?

1033
01:37:26,583 --> 01:37:28,041
Although I don't quite understand

1034
01:37:28,083 --> 01:37:30,750
what Pokrovskaya could be
unhappy about in this situation.

1035
01:37:34,333 --> 01:37:37,000
Pokrovskaya scores again.
She's obliterating her.

1036
01:37:37,833 --> 01:37:39,083
What's up with Kira?

1037
01:37:41,375 --> 01:37:43,583
Don't you dare doing that, you understand?

1038
01:37:43,666 --> 01:37:46,791
- But these are your Olympic Games.
- I don't need a victory of this kind.

1039
01:37:46,875 --> 01:37:48,125
Fight me!

1040
01:37:49,708 --> 01:37:52,750
Throwing fights is not what
I taught you to do. Fight me!

1041
01:38:16,375 --> 01:38:17,916
Yes! Good job!

1042
01:38:18,375 --> 01:38:21,166
And it's Yegorova's first hit.
Has Kira awaken from her sleep?

1043
01:38:26,416 --> 01:38:27,416
Yes!

1044
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:29,000
Yegorova scores once again.

1045
01:38:31,333 --> 01:38:32,500
An awesome hit!

1046
01:38:33,791 --> 01:38:35,416
A splitting attack from Pokrovskaya.

1047
01:38:35,875 --> 01:38:38,208
Kira just can't seem
to break into the lead.

1048
01:38:43,416 --> 01:38:44,833
Yegorova scores again!

1049
01:38:46,708 --> 01:38:49,625
And again! Kira narrows the gap.

1050
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,250
Come on, darling, come on.

1051
01:38:53,750 --> 01:38:55,458
Pokrovskaya retaliates.

1052
01:38:57,958 --> 01:38:59,625
And Yegorova scores again!

1053
01:39:05,416 --> 01:39:07,166
Yegorova evens the score.

1054
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:08,375
Yes!

1055
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:16,041
It looks like Kira's knee injury
is giving her trouble.

1056
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:18,041
The timing couldn't be worse.

1057
01:39:46,708 --> 01:39:47,750
Yes!

1058
01:39:50,791 --> 01:39:53,666
Pokrovskaya takes lead.
The score is 14:13.

1059
01:39:54,083 --> 01:39:57,041
She's just one hit away from victory.

1060
01:40:04,208 --> 01:40:06,375
You must not just
adapt to your injury.

1061
01:40:06,708 --> 01:40:08,791
You must completely change who you are.

1062
01:40:08,875 --> 01:40:11,708
You must learn to use this pain
to your advantage.

1063
01:40:22,208 --> 01:40:25,000
Yes! Yes! Well done!

1064
01:40:25,375 --> 01:40:29,541
Kira successfully overcomes her emotions
and lands a very important hit.

1065
01:40:30,708 --> 01:40:33,541
The current score is fourteen all.
Now it will be this final hit

1066
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:36,041
that will determine
who the gold medal will go to.

1067
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:33,166
Yes! Yes!

1068
01:41:33,291 --> 01:41:35,375
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1069
01:41:38,625 --> 01:41:40,708
Yes!

1070
01:41:49,291 --> 01:41:52,791
Your daughter is an Olympic champion!
Do you understand it?

1071
01:42:20,208 --> 01:42:22,291
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1072
01:42:48,541 --> 01:42:50,333
What a great fight. Go on guys.

1073
01:42:57,083 --> 01:42:59,208
The award ceremony completes
the first stage

1074
01:42:59,291 --> 01:43:00,541
of the competition.

1075
01:43:00,625 --> 01:43:02,458
The final was just fantastic!

1076
01:43:03,083 --> 01:43:05,541
But the Olympics aren't over yet
for our atheletes.

1077
01:43:06,291 --> 01:43:09,083
And tomorrow our female Sabre fencers
will have a team competition.

1078
01:43:09,166 --> 01:43:11,500
This is a chance to win
another gold medal.

1079
01:43:13,583 --> 01:43:16,791
We congratulate Kira Yegorova,
who earned her gold medal

1080
01:43:16,875 --> 01:43:19,416
in a tense fight
with Alexandra Pokrovskaya.

1081
01:43:19,833 --> 01:43:22,041
And we understand how Alexandra feels.

1082
01:43:22,541 --> 01:43:24,208
But tomorrow they have
a team competition.

1083
01:43:24,291 --> 01:43:27,458
So Pokrovskaya and Yegorova
will have to get past today's rivalry

1084
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:28,958
and perform as one team.

1085
01:44:34,666 --> 01:44:35,708
Congratulations.

1086
01:44:42,541 --> 01:44:45,250
You deserved this gold medal. You did.

1087
01:44:50,083 --> 01:44:53,000
If it weren't for your help,
I would have never made it here.

1088
01:44:56,750 --> 01:44:57,791
May I?

1089
01:45:10,375 --> 01:45:14,666
This is the thing I've spent
my entire life on.

1090
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:30,625
I was always afraid
this moment would come.

1091
01:45:33,916 --> 01:45:35,916
The moment when I'd have to leave.

1092
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:43,500
Damn. Why is this so hard?

1093
01:45:47,708 --> 01:45:50,708
- There's still a team competition.
- Yes, I know that.

1094
01:45:53,416 --> 01:45:54,833
Now you've become the team's leader.

1095
01:45:54,916 --> 01:45:55,916
- No.
- Yes.

1096
01:45:56,166 --> 01:45:59,541
No, I'm just a girl who knows how to
swing her Sabre, that's all.

1097
01:46:00,333 --> 01:46:04,583
You are the team's captain.
Alexandra, we won't manage without you.

1098
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:08,666
We really need you now.

1099
01:46:24,458 --> 01:46:25,833
- Hello.
- Hello.

1100
01:46:27,583 --> 01:46:31,416
Hello. Kostya. I'm very glad
to hear your voice.

1101
01:46:32,208 --> 01:46:35,166
Alexandra, wait. You know,

1102
01:46:36,125 --> 01:46:38,791
I can't even imagine
how you must be feeling right now.

1103
01:46:39,166 --> 01:46:40,666
Or what you're going through.

1104
01:46:43,583 --> 01:46:45,000
I just want you to know

1105
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:48,708
that I believe in you
even more than you do.

1106
01:46:59,166 --> 01:47:00,250
Thank you.

1107
01:47:07,041 --> 01:47:08,416
Pokrovskaya scores a point.

1108
01:47:08,833 --> 01:47:11,000
Well done. Alexandra is on fire today.

1109
01:47:11,166 --> 01:47:12,750
It's the final fight
of the Olympics

1110
01:47:12,833 --> 01:47:16,375
and Russian female team is fighting
the French fencers for the gold medals.

1111
01:47:17,083 --> 01:47:19,458
Yes!
The emotions are running high!

1112
01:47:19,708 --> 01:47:22,250
It's amazing what's happening
on the sports arena.

1113
01:47:25,583 --> 01:47:27,875
The fight is continued by Kira Yegorova.

1114
01:47:28,958 --> 01:47:30,833
Come on, come on, till the end!

1115
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:34,416
The match is extremely tense.

1116
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:37,333
It's Nina Pogodina's turn.

1117
01:47:37,583 --> 01:47:39,083
Come on, Nina! Well done!

1118
01:47:40,083 --> 01:47:42,500
It's back to Pokrovskaya. She lands a cut.

1119
01:47:42,583 --> 01:47:43,875
Good job, girls!

1120
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:46,250
Our girls are the best today.

1121
01:47:47,541 --> 01:47:49,541
Alexandra Pokrovskaya
is back on the piste.

1122
01:47:49,625 --> 01:47:53,500
Right now, the fate of the Olympic gold
can be determined by just one cut.

1123
01:48:04,375 --> 01:48:08,250
- Yes!
- Yes! We are Olympic champions!

1124
01:48:08,333 --> 01:48:10,583
We are Olympic champions!

1125
01:48:10,666 --> 01:48:13,208
And Alexandra Pokrovskaya
receives the award

1126
01:48:13,291 --> 01:48:15,666
she's been striving for her whole life.

1127
01:48:48,083 --> 01:48:50,208
Yes!

1128
01:48:52,041 --> 01:48:53,750
That's it! We are Olympic champions.

1129
01:48:53,833 --> 01:48:55,166
We are Olympic champions!

1130
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:58,958
And Sofiya Velikaya receives the award
she's been striving for her whole career.

1131
01:48:59,041 --> 01:49:01,958
Time's up, time's up, time's up,
time's up, time's up, time's up!

1132
01:49:03,791 --> 01:49:06,041
Yes! We've got a winner!

1133
01:49:06,125 --> 01:49:08,125
Inna Deriglazova.

1134
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:11,750
Oh wow! Yana Egorian!

1135
01:49:12,291 --> 01:49:16,916
Getting gold
at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.

1136
01:49:19,416 --> 01:49:21,833
It's a win for Sofia Pozdniakova
and she cries with joy.

1137
01:49:21,916 --> 01:49:23,000
It's a happy ending.
