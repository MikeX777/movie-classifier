1
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:29,885
THE MAN WHO HAS
NO IMAGINATION HAS NO WINGS

2
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:12,752
We should've stayed at the hotel!

3
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,062
Which way did he go?

4
00:02:10,738 --> 00:02:13,516
This is a temple. What're you scheming?

5
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:15,547
It's for a birthday.

6
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:16,673
Whose?

7
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,088
You must be nuts!

8
00:02:22,112 --> 00:02:24,380
They're gone. Why still on me?

9
00:02:24,404 --> 00:02:25,650
So? You're not a girl.

10
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,220
Me?

11
00:02:27,654 --> 00:02:29,618
You almost killed me. Some thanks!

12
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,065
Let me apologize.

13
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,546
Just stay away from me,

14
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,768
that's all I want.

15
00:02:37,112 --> 00:02:38,380
You spell trouble.

16
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:40,415
You coward! If you're chicken...

17
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:46,899
No, don't go!

18
00:02:47,695 --> 00:02:51,288
It's for the
store. No one's around.

19
00:02:55,944 --> 00:02:57,525
And a pack of smokes.

20
00:02:57,736 --> 00:02:58,790
Come on.

21
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:16,515
Don't you like soccer?

22
00:03:18,276 --> 00:03:20,337
Can I have chiclets?

23
00:03:20,652 --> 00:03:21,993
Please?

24
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:27,163
And some candy, too.

25
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:30,330
You speak good French.

26
00:03:31,026 --> 00:03:33,038
Where'd you learn? From movies?

27
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:42,274
Bet you didn't know
Jackie Chan is in Enter the Dragon.

28
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,146
Thanks.

29
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:54,306
It's Bruce Lee.

30
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:58,275
Oh really?

31
00:03:58,775 --> 00:04:01,890
If I prove it's Jackie Chan,

32
00:04:02,274 --> 00:04:03,760
tell me your name?

33
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:09,010
Who's that?

34
00:04:22,816 --> 00:04:23,917
Zohra.

35
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:29,672
See how glad they are to hear your name?

36
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:38,432
If they saw that
smile, they'd win the World Cup.

37
00:04:54,315 --> 00:04:55,315
Thanks.

38
00:04:59,814 --> 00:05:05,611
THREE MONTHS LATER

39
00:05:25,021 --> 00:05:26,028
Hello.

40
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:29,218
The first time I met Zohra...

41
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:30,884
A ticket, please.

42
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:33,141
Was to take her to the mall.

43
00:05:34,438 --> 00:05:35,438
Thanks.

44
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,081
Excuse me.
I need to get here.

45
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:39,581
That's the mall.

46
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:40,956
Take the 28,

47
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,183
or wait for the 82.

48
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,877
It's not...?

49
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:47,206
Wrong bus, right stop.

50
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,413
Ok.

51
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:49,437
Alright.

52
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:52,345
Alright, thanks.

53
00:05:58,646 --> 00:05:59,955
I'm done in 2 stops.

54
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:01,704
I'll drop you off after.

55
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,474
Thank you.

56
00:07:08,393 --> 00:07:10,740
Gimme the price, please!

57
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:13,447
It's on sale: 4.49â‚¬.

58
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:14,984
No problem.

59
00:07:15,142 --> 00:07:17,661
Have a good day. Bye.

60
00:07:17,685 --> 00:07:20,910
Sorry, I'm closing the register.

61
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:22,995
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye, Zohra!

62
00:07:25,393 --> 00:07:26,830
Wait, wait!

63
00:07:28,518 --> 00:07:30,077
Leaving without me?

64
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:31,730
I wouldn't dare.

65
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:40,951
In a few months,

66
00:07:40,975 --> 00:07:44,472
Zohra had become
one of the most popular cashiers.

67
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:47,581
And a happy woman.

68
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,909
Omar could make her laugh.

69
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:00,450
Laugh, nardinamuk!

70
00:08:00,474 --> 00:08:01,866
Laugh until she cried.

71
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,047
Why're you laughing?

72
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:11,281
As much as Zohra loved her life,

73
00:08:17,182 --> 00:08:19,002
he hated his.

74
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,078
Want your food?

75
00:08:38,306 --> 00:08:43,032
Sure, back home Zohra'd had
only weeks to get to know her husband.

76
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,574
See this?

77
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:46,115
See, it's better.

78
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:47,481
Fill it up.

79
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:50,835
He could be so annoying!

80
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:53,323
The number's not in your contacts.

81
00:08:53,347 --> 00:08:54,593
Controlling.

82
00:08:56,222 --> 00:08:57,615
The trouble with Omar

83
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:01,345
was that he spent more
time looking at guys eying Zohra

84
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:03,592
than looking at Zohra.

85
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,916
Then one day...

86
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,356
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

87
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:25,640
I dunno. It's in my locker or in Nico's.

88
00:09:26,262 --> 00:09:28,467
Just check.

89
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:31,954
If it's not there, then check Antoine's.

90
00:09:32,054 --> 00:09:33,863
I'll call you back. 'Later.

91
00:09:33,887 --> 00:09:35,516
All set?

92
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:46,321
Called twice. Just tell me.
You answered, so you know who it is.

93
00:09:46,345 --> 00:09:49,112
The first time I look at your phone...

94
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:50,191
Thank you.

95
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:51,928
Hi.

96
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,955
How's it going?

97
00:10:01,345 --> 00:10:02,590
Thanks.

98
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:05,640
- Can I take a napkin?
- Sure.

99
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,445
Thanks. Bye.

100
00:10:08,136 --> 00:10:12,070
Omar came more and
more often to see Zohra, let's say,

101
00:10:12,094 --> 00:10:13,627
unexpectedly.

102
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:21,070
How're you doing?

103
00:10:21,094 --> 00:10:22,483
And you?

104
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,527
Ok.

105
00:10:23,594 --> 00:10:25,236
A guy or a girl?

106
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,075
I don't know.

107
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:27,736
You don't know? You picked up twice.

108
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,070
They hung up.

109
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:30,528
- Answer me.
- No.

110
00:10:30,552 --> 00:10:32,903
- You don't know?
- No, I don't.

111
00:10:32,927 --> 00:10:34,236
Look. I'm not lying.

112
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,111
- Cut it out.
- You know damn well.

113
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,319
Stop it! Give
me my phone back.

114
00:10:38,343 --> 00:10:40,152
- Is it a guy...
- You're a pain!

115
00:10:40,176 --> 00:10:41,611
- Tell me.
- I want my phone.

116
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:42,902
Here's your phone!

117
00:10:42,926 --> 00:10:44,818
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

118
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:45,962
- Zohra!
- Lay off!

119
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:49,701
Zohra?

120
00:10:50,093 --> 00:10:52,057
I didn't mean to.

121
00:10:54,343 --> 00:10:56,110
Show me your face.

122
00:10:56,134 --> 00:10:58,626
But even if he'd crossed a limit...

123
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:01,027
Damn, come on. I didn't mean to.

124
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:02,488
Zohra hadn't reached hers.

125
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:10,281
I have conjunctivitis.

126
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:37,979
That's what was crazy.

127
00:11:40,174 --> 00:11:43,960
She was more upset
about not getting pregnant.

128
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:03,378
You know, Zohra,

129
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:06,398
I've had conjunctivitis twice.

130
00:12:10,923 --> 00:12:12,232
The first time I let it go.

131
00:12:12,256 --> 00:12:15,994
It kept apologizing.
I wanted to believe it.

132
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:17,912
Follow me?

133
00:12:18,173 --> 00:12:19,173
Yeah.

134
00:12:19,923 --> 00:12:25,097
The second time, I sent two
homies, and they sure took care of it.

135
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,000
No salad dressing.

136
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:31,055
They forgot it again.

137
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:33,464
It wound up in the hospital.

138
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:37,503
- Who?
- My second conjunctivitis.

139
00:12:37,797 --> 00:12:39,618
I'm sure they'd take care of yours.

140
00:12:41,673 --> 00:12:42,534
Of my eyes?

141
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:44,217
His knees!

142
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,290
But it'll open your
eyes. You won't need...

143
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:50,848
Gotta get back!

144
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,530
See ya later.

145
00:12:55,713 --> 00:12:56,939
There she goes,

146
00:12:56,963 --> 00:12:58,640
the evasion queen.

147
00:13:01,796 --> 00:13:02,946
I have cataracts.

148
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:05,463
Uveitis.

149
00:13:07,463 --> 00:13:09,379
Macular degeneration.

150
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:12,836
She could learn Wikipedia by heart.

151
00:13:12,963 --> 00:13:15,502
Sooner or later
it blows up in your face.

152
00:13:31,962 --> 00:13:32,962
Pathetic!

153
00:13:46,503 --> 00:13:50,911
Wife-beating apparently
skyrockets on game nights.

154
00:13:51,336 --> 00:13:52,728
But hang on,

155
00:13:52,752 --> 00:13:56,811
I'm not saying sports
events cause domestic violence.

156
00:13:56,835 --> 00:14:01,339
That would mean violent
people aren't responsible for their acts.

157
00:14:01,794 --> 00:14:03,646
I'm not saying it's the game's fault,

158
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,354
but don't say it's booze,

159
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,479
because only 1
in 4 perpetrators is drunk.

160
00:14:08,503 --> 00:14:11,102
That still makes 3 sober assholes

161
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:14,561
who manage to blame
their behavior on adrenaline

162
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:16,166
or their favorite team.

163
00:14:17,502 --> 00:14:21,561
As the World Cup is an
additional factor of domestic violence,

164
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:25,274
some people will
cross the limit for the first time.

165
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:27,279
The good news

166
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:30,076
is that Zohra had finally reached hers.

167
00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:32,251
Zohra!

168
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:37,457
Go! Shut the door. Please!

169
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:38,645
Go.

170
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,477
Move!

171
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:42,369
Don't do this, please.

172
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:44,268
Hands off my bus, dammit!

173
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:45,682
Get outta here!

174
00:14:46,084 --> 00:14:47,185
Get lost.

175
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:48,809
Zohra, get off, please.

176
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:51,757
Get off the bus, please. Look at me.

177
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,259
Out of the way, dammit!

178
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,223
How's it going?

179
00:17:06,704 --> 00:17:09,722
6 YEARS LATER

180
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:13,680
Daddy?
You coming with us?

181
00:17:13,704 --> 00:17:15,970
- Where to?
- Away for the weekend.

182
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:19,554
What? It's next weekend.
Your mommy got mixed up again.

183
00:17:19,578 --> 00:17:22,179
- This weekend is the carnival.
- Really?

184
00:17:22,203 --> 00:17:24,762
We can't miss that.

185
00:17:24,786 --> 00:17:26,262
We can't miss the carnival.

186
00:17:26,286 --> 00:17:29,720
Having a little girl in
their life didn't change much.

187
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:30,929
Actually, it did.

188
00:17:30,953 --> 00:17:33,887
Now, when Zohra tried to leave,

189
00:17:33,911 --> 00:17:36,834
Omar didn't even
have to clean up his act.

190
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:40,606
He'd figured out quick
that if their daughter stayed,

191
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:43,256
her mom would come back.

192
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:46,493
...call SOS battered women...

193
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:06,985
What is it, sweetie?

194
00:18:07,493 --> 00:18:08,978
I'm thirsty.

195
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:17,079
No, you'll wake Daddy!

196
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:18,678
Here.

197
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:29,861
Why do you sleep on the couch?

198
00:18:33,741 --> 00:18:35,515
You really want to know?

199
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:44,814
- Do you get it now?
- Yes.

200
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:52,072
There.

201
00:18:54,158 --> 00:18:55,356
What is it?

202
00:18:57,075 --> 00:18:58,320
What's the matter?

203
00:19:01,449 --> 00:19:03,462
Is that why your dad left?

204
00:19:05,115 --> 00:19:05,882
What?

205
00:19:05,949 --> 00:19:08,249
Because your mom snored?

206
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:12,592
I don't remember, sweetie.

207
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:15,394
You really don't remember him?

208
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,096
I remember at night,

209
00:19:21,282 --> 00:19:24,175
when I was about
your age and it was late,

210
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:26,834
my dad would still be at work.

211
00:19:27,114 --> 00:19:29,511
I'd try to wait up for him.

212
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:32,382
I'd keep my eyes wide open like this,

213
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:33,987
wide open,

214
00:19:35,906 --> 00:19:39,356
and then I'd hear...

215
00:19:42,657 --> 00:19:43,657
Hear that?

216
00:19:52,614 --> 00:19:53,923
What was it?

217
00:19:53,947 --> 00:19:55,923
It was his kung fu movie.

218
00:19:55,947 --> 00:19:59,685
I knew he was
home, so I could go to sleep.

219
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,015
Nighty-night now.

220
00:20:10,697 --> 00:20:13,284
I wouldn't want my dad to be gone.

221
00:20:20,737 --> 00:20:23,181
No one's going anywhere, sweetie.

222
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:24,728
Promise?

223
00:20:25,737 --> 00:20:26,840
Promise.

224
00:20:46,861 --> 00:20:50,408
Zohra knew she could
stick around for her daughter,

225
00:20:51,861 --> 00:20:53,634
but not take it anymore.

226
00:21:15,486 --> 00:21:17,354
Trouble is, on the Internet

227
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:20,471
there's anything and everything.

228
00:21:24,402 --> 00:21:26,319
Especially a lot of crap.

229
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:35,964
But with patience,

230
00:21:37,235 --> 00:21:39,726
Zohra finally found her master.

231
00:21:44,026 --> 00:21:46,336
Hi, I'm Jean-Yves Sylvain.

232
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,474
If you have to
fight it out, call my name.

233
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:51,544
As a bodyguard,

234
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:54,169
world-known martial arts instructor

235
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:55,752
and police consultant,

236
00:21:55,776 --> 00:21:59,419
I'll teach you the
most effective techniques,

237
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,838
formidable street-fighting skills.

238
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,810
You'll be surprised.

239
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,834
We've all seen
jealous husbands or hotheads

240
00:22:13,858 --> 00:22:16,168
always ready with a slap.

241
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:19,335
The Harveys, the
Kevins... Not only in movies.

242
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,335
They're all over, around the corner,

243
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,126
on the bus, sometimes even at home.

244
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,043
As a result, you lose everything: Face,

245
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:28,709
self-esteem, self-respect,

246
00:22:28,733 --> 00:22:31,958
and sometimes a few teeth.

247
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:33,958
One blow, two if need be.

248
00:22:33,982 --> 00:22:35,334
Grab an ear, pull back.

249
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:37,000
Not too far back.

250
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:38,223
About here and bam!

251
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,295
A straight kick in the legs.

252
00:22:45,608 --> 00:22:48,386
Thank you. Have a nice day.

253
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,859
For weeks, Zohra
was all about Jean-Yves.

254
00:22:55,191 --> 00:22:56,334
She was hooked.

255
00:22:56,358 --> 00:22:57,698
Grab an ear, pull back.

256
00:22:58,856 --> 00:23:01,205
One blow, two if need be.

257
00:23:01,565 --> 00:23:03,333
Either an elbow to the throat,

258
00:23:03,357 --> 00:23:06,541
or my favorite
in this case, right here.

259
00:23:06,565 --> 00:23:08,249
I guarantee a K.O.

260
00:23:08,273 --> 00:23:10,832
A guy grabs you,
don't do too much damage.

261
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,082
Raise your hands...

262
00:23:12,106 --> 00:23:15,077
The more space Jean-Yves took up,

263
00:23:16,148 --> 00:23:17,585
the less Zohra had.

264
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:19,441
Easy in there!

265
00:23:25,564 --> 00:23:30,069
Any other woman would've
signed up for a self-defense class.

266
00:23:30,897 --> 00:23:32,191
But not Zohra.

267
00:23:39,897 --> 00:23:43,730
Between 5G and the grapevine,
Omar would've known in a flash.

268
00:23:43,897 --> 00:23:45,498
Good job, sweetie!

269
00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:47,582
Get me a Sprite.

270
00:24:56,478 --> 00:24:57,820
Come on!

271
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:02,233
I don't believe this!

272
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:10,942
It's not me. This is the second time!

273
00:25:12,976 --> 00:25:13,976
What?

274
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,746
That.

275
00:25:22,851 --> 00:25:23,851
Yes.

276
00:25:47,184 --> 00:25:49,244
What? I ran into something.

277
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,703
WANTED Floor technician.

278
00:26:22,016 --> 00:26:23,022
Of course.

279
00:26:23,058 --> 00:26:25,645
I know the gym.
My daughter goes there.

280
00:26:26,724 --> 00:26:27,724
Yes.

281
00:26:30,223 --> 00:26:31,230
Alright.

282
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,536
I'll call you back.

283
00:26:36,848 --> 00:26:40,012
Ok, I'll wait for
your call. Fine. Thanks.

284
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:42,267
What's this, Zohra?

285
00:26:43,641 --> 00:26:45,658
- What's the phone rule?
- I'm on my break.

286
00:26:45,682 --> 00:26:47,166
How's it going?

287
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:50,408
I know it's rough at home sometimes.

288
00:26:50,432 --> 00:26:52,636
If you need a bodyguard,

289
00:26:53,432 --> 00:26:55,033
I'll give you a good rate!

290
00:26:55,057 --> 00:26:56,542
3 hours, 4 times a week.

291
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:59,346
6 on Wednesday,
there are a lot of clubs.

292
00:27:00,139 --> 00:27:01,338
After you.

293
00:27:08,139 --> 00:27:11,062
Can I do my hours after closing?

294
00:27:11,306 --> 00:27:13,157
It's easier with my daughter.

295
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:14,823
And it would be empty.

296
00:27:14,847 --> 00:27:16,198
No night shift here.

297
00:27:16,222 --> 00:27:18,714
Ok, no problem. I'll work it out.

298
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:21,854
- As long as the job's done.
- It will be. Don't worry.

299
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,710
Give us a few days,

300
00:27:24,971 --> 00:27:28,031
and we'll get back
to you with an answer, ok?

301
00:27:28,055 --> 00:27:29,406
Yes, with pleasure.

302
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,724
Hello, Chang!

303
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:32,989
He's the janitor?

304
00:27:33,013 --> 00:27:36,197
Not officially, but
the last one had a burnout,

305
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,448
so his uncle Chang covers for him.

306
00:27:38,472 --> 00:27:41,202
He's harmless, just an old yokel.

307
00:27:42,055 --> 00:27:44,594
- Where from?
- Peking.

308
00:27:44,721 --> 00:27:46,697
I'll leave you.

309
00:27:46,721 --> 00:27:48,196
See you soon.

310
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,898
See you soon. Bye.

311
00:28:29,386 --> 00:28:31,571
Channel his aggression to divert it,

312
00:28:31,595 --> 00:28:33,362
divert the other's aggression.

313
00:28:33,386 --> 00:28:36,029
And always strike with determination.

314
00:28:36,053 --> 00:28:36,962
Cause pain.

315
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:41,320
The techniques you'll see
will enable you to finally feel safe

316
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,694
and regain
self-confidence. Essential.

317
00:28:43,718 --> 00:28:46,528
Inside, both in
your mind and in your home.

318
00:28:46,552 --> 00:28:49,666
Outside of your
body and out in the street.

319
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:58,111
Sure. Look.
Wait for the slow motion.

320
00:28:58,135 --> 00:29:00,243
You can see the crossbar.

321
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:05,635
Well?

322
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:06,922
He's on defense.

323
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:09,235
Every strike is decisive.

324
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:12,134
All your energy in every hit.

325
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:14,985
A single hit might not be enough.

326
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:18,219
A series of hits makes it effective.

327
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:22,193
I go in with a cross kick about here,

328
00:29:22,217 --> 00:29:23,128
and bam!

329
00:29:23,176 --> 00:29:25,485
A straight kick.

330
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:27,138
I go for the neck. Bam!

331
00:29:28,468 --> 00:29:30,048
I hit the throat.

332
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:31,611
Respiratory arrest.

333
00:29:31,635 --> 00:29:33,215
Then I hit the thighs.

334
00:29:34,675 --> 00:29:38,526
You feel the power. If
you want to move on to the knees,

335
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:42,192
the whole locomotor
apparatus is damaged. You can't walk.

336
00:29:42,216 --> 00:29:43,817
The adversary is out of commission.

337
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:46,692
Always strike vital points.

338
00:29:46,716 --> 00:29:49,234
Focus on the target

339
00:29:49,258 --> 00:29:52,276
and use 1000% of your energy.

340
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,503
Breathing is important...

341
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:18,588
What're you doing?

342
00:30:36,006 --> 00:30:37,395
Kitchen.

343
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:39,995
Kitchen?

344
00:30:44,298 --> 00:30:46,982
No, not kitchen!

345
00:31:25,004 --> 00:31:26,564
Let's get this straight:

346
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:29,318
I can work out after the job is done.

347
00:31:30,212 --> 00:31:32,063
Report me if you want.

348
00:31:32,087 --> 00:31:34,484
When I go, the place is spotless. Right?

349
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:36,993
You're kitchen!

350
00:31:37,588 --> 00:31:39,552
My place isn't the kitchen!

351
00:32:03,378 --> 00:32:04,538
"Draw your kitchen?"

352
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:08,484
What's that mean?

353
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,687
Hey you! Closed!

354
00:32:11,711 --> 00:32:13,053
Why're you here?

355
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:18,029
Zina is at Marion's.

356
00:32:18,544 --> 00:32:20,645
I thought we'd catch a movie.

357
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:22,346
Sure. Great.

358
00:32:23,544 --> 00:32:24,885
Thank you, sir.

359
00:32:30,044 --> 00:32:31,241
Thanks.

360
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:35,495
- Why's he got your bag?
- No locks.

361
00:32:38,543 --> 00:32:39,742
Gimme that.

362
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:43,231
Those hands aren't for cleaning.

363
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:47,144
It'll pay for plane
tickets and Christmas gifts.

364
00:32:47,168 --> 00:32:49,102
And you lost the Clichy job.

365
00:32:49,126 --> 00:32:50,935
Gonna bring that up again?

366
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:52,014
I swear!

367
00:33:04,043 --> 00:33:06,809
If you must fight in a jar,

368
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:08,942
train in a jar.

369
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:12,903
Find that in a fortune cookie?

370
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:19,059
What's he mean by "jar"?

371
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:22,393
A jar is a small receptacle.

372
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,423
What's it mean?

373
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,998
A small receptacle.

374
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:31,106
- And what's "draw your kitchen" mean?
- Just, draw your kitchen!

375
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,507
Yeah, but... "Draw your kitchen"?

376
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:45,555
Mommy!

377
00:33:47,082 --> 00:33:49,933
How are you,
sweetie? Have a good day?

378
00:33:49,957 --> 00:33:51,730
Yeah? Did you learn lots?

379
00:34:32,872 --> 00:34:36,322
Where there's a will, there's a way...

380
00:35:04,455 --> 00:35:05,891
Hey, kitchen!

381
00:38:19,156 --> 00:38:20,556
- Yes?
- It's not working.

382
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:27,171
Merry Christmas.

383
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:06,287
Excuse me.

384
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,580
I've got the kitchen down pat.

385
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,877
How was your day?

386
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:18,051
Here, sweetie.

387
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:20,877
- Mom?
- Yes, sweetie.

388
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:24,043
Marion invited me
to the shore this summer.

389
00:40:24,067 --> 00:40:25,252
Can I go?

390
00:40:25,276 --> 00:40:26,276
What?

391
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:27,834
I didn't understand.

392
00:40:27,901 --> 00:40:31,206
Marion invited me
to the shore this summer.

393
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:36,238
- You know we have to ask Dad.
- You know he'll say no.

394
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:45,042
You know what? Let me handle this.

395
00:40:45,066 --> 00:40:47,606
Handle it how? Tell me.

396
00:40:50,442 --> 00:40:52,334
Come on. Why?

397
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:53,748
Because.

398
00:40:59,191 --> 00:41:01,041
Why won't you tell me?

399
00:41:01,065 --> 00:41:03,625
Don't sell the
pelt until you kill the bear.

400
00:41:03,649 --> 00:41:05,125
What'd you say?

401
00:41:05,149 --> 00:41:07,375
Don't sell the
pelt until you kill the bear.

402
00:41:07,399 --> 00:41:08,932
What's that mean?

403
00:41:10,232 --> 00:41:12,083
Know what a Djerba-Paris costs?

404
00:41:12,107 --> 00:41:15,250
We have a week
to reschedule for no charge.

405
00:41:15,274 --> 00:41:17,958
Like last year when you got the job.

406
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:23,417
I think it's good at
her age to meet new people.

407
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:25,208
She'll never see her grandma.

408
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,286
Oh, please.

409
00:41:26,316 --> 00:41:29,541
Her grandma's
outlived Michael Jackson, Bowie,

410
00:41:29,565 --> 00:41:32,915
Johnny Hallyday, Prince,
and that poor kid on Koh Lanta.

411
00:41:32,939 --> 00:41:34,019
I wouldn't worry.

412
00:41:34,273 --> 00:41:36,573
She's fit as a fiddle, hamdullah.

413
00:41:42,772 --> 00:41:45,360
Don't sell the
pelt until you kill the bear?

414
00:41:49,231 --> 00:41:52,824
Sometimes the bear
won't give you the time of day.

415
00:42:13,606 --> 00:42:14,945
I'm talking to you.

416
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:44,696
In the end,

417
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,656
Zohra came to realize that sometimes

418
00:42:49,437 --> 00:42:52,503
it's best to sell the pelt first.

419
00:42:52,936 --> 00:42:55,476
CANCEL / CONFIRM

420
00:43:06,728 --> 00:43:08,021
CONFIRM

421
00:43:11,353 --> 00:43:14,323
Your flight change has been recorded.

422
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:17,807
Excuse me!

423
00:43:19,894 --> 00:43:20,948
I'm coming.

424
00:43:29,102 --> 00:43:31,066
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

425
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:38,116
Yeah, I changed
the ticket. That's right.

426
00:43:39,726 --> 00:43:41,356
I'm sick of you.

427
00:43:41,602 --> 00:43:43,134
You're in for it!

428
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:58,785
The travel agency emailed me.

429
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:01,396
- Why're you here?
- You changed the ticket?

430
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:04,059
Yes.

431
00:44:04,893 --> 00:44:05,893
I got open...

432
00:44:34,932 --> 00:44:36,082
Stop it!

433
00:44:36,558 --> 00:44:37,995
What the hell?

434
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:42,825
He hits you and you don't fight back!

435
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:44,534
Why do I teach you?

436
00:44:44,558 --> 00:44:45,851
No more lessons!

437
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:17,321
End of the line, everyone out!

438
00:46:17,345 --> 00:46:19,310
I'm going back to the depot.

439
00:46:19,678 --> 00:46:20,972
Everyone out, please.

440
00:46:21,429 --> 00:46:24,159
Sorry, engine
trouble. Back to the depot.

441
00:46:25,678 --> 00:46:27,212
Thank you!

442
00:46:35,803 --> 00:46:37,337
What're you doing?

443
00:46:38,345 --> 00:46:39,926
Tell me what happened.

444
00:46:51,219 --> 00:46:53,695
A friend of mine's leaving her place.

445
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:55,252
A one-bedroom.

446
00:46:55,511 --> 00:46:56,871
5 min from Zina's school.

447
00:46:57,469 --> 00:46:58,716
What do you say?

448
00:47:05,969 --> 00:47:08,028
What're you waiting for?

449
00:47:08,802 --> 00:47:10,528
Where is this going?

450
00:47:11,343 --> 00:47:12,902
What is it you want?

451
00:47:12,926 --> 00:47:14,486
Nothing. Let me out.

452
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:16,762
It's a way out. What do you want?

453
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:18,738
Open up.

454
00:47:19,385 --> 00:47:20,151
Open up.

455
00:47:20,218 --> 00:47:21,986
Think she can't take a divorce?

456
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:23,063
No!

457
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:25,444
- You can't understand.
- Why not?

458
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:26,810
You don't have kids.

459
00:47:37,634 --> 00:47:41,516
There're dozens of them
at school. She won't stand out.

460
00:47:42,301 --> 00:47:44,277
5 min away from her school.

461
00:47:44,301 --> 00:47:47,193
You go home after
work, you're alone with your kid.

462
00:47:47,217 --> 00:47:48,511
Yeah...

463
00:47:51,758 --> 00:47:53,771
How do you want this to end?

464
00:48:05,425 --> 00:48:06,984
He plays soccer with her.

465
00:48:07,008 --> 00:48:10,650
He watches cartoons,
does coloring books, juggles.

466
00:48:10,674 --> 00:48:13,067
He takes her hands
and she walks on his feet.

467
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:14,526
He plays and tickles.

468
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:18,095
He knows how to
make her laugh, he makes faces.

469
00:48:18,258 --> 00:48:20,510
She'll leave with him.

470
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:28,050
Open up. Please.

471
00:48:43,048 --> 00:48:45,827
You can keep finding reasons to stay.

472
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,415
I've run out of reasons to shut up.

473
00:49:04,672 --> 00:49:08,028
No, wait, Zina. Don't open the door.

474
00:49:10,172 --> 00:49:11,648
Hello, ma'am.

475
00:49:11,672 --> 00:49:14,979
Police. We'd like to
speak with Mr. Omar Hamidi.

476
00:49:15,506 --> 00:49:16,607
What's going on?

477
00:49:16,631 --> 00:49:17,923
I'll call you back.

478
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,481
Tell me what's going on.

479
00:49:21,423 --> 00:49:22,907
Police.

480
00:49:23,213 --> 00:49:26,135
- Mr. Omar Hamidi?
- Yes. What's going on?

481
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:30,856
Come with us.
We'll discuss it at the station.

482
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,565
Like hell I'm coming. Now?

483
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:34,739
Yes, right now.

484
00:49:38,338 --> 00:49:40,158
Domestic violence.

485
00:49:47,005 --> 00:49:50,070
Can't it wait? I
could come to the station...

486
00:49:50,670 --> 00:49:53,272
Can I just talk to my...

487
00:49:53,296 --> 00:49:55,188
Wait, just a minute.

488
00:49:55,212 --> 00:49:57,729
I don't understand. What's this about?

489
00:49:57,753 --> 00:50:00,855
Domestic violence.
We need to talk to your husband.

490
00:50:00,879 --> 00:50:03,802
- Let's go quietly.
- This isn't the time.

491
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:04,855
It's in your best interest.

492
00:50:04,879 --> 00:50:07,562
- Go to your room.
- Why are they here?

493
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,363
Come with us, please.

494
00:50:09,629 --> 00:50:11,313
No, wait a minute!

495
00:50:11,337 --> 00:50:14,105
We have an
important game. He can't leave.

496
00:50:14,129 --> 00:50:15,271
Can't it wait?

497
00:50:15,295 --> 00:50:16,479
Go, sweetie.

498
00:50:16,503 --> 00:50:17,812
Calm down.

499
00:50:17,836 --> 00:50:19,354
Can I have a second, please?

500
00:50:19,378 --> 00:50:20,396
What do they want?

501
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,426
Come here, sweetie.

502
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,062
Give me a second.

503
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:26,062
Sweetie, the nice policemen

504
00:50:26,086 --> 00:50:28,099
are looking for a bad guy.

505
00:50:28,336 --> 00:50:29,854
So I'm leaving with them,

506
00:50:29,878 --> 00:50:32,187
and if I can help them, that's great.

507
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:34,895
But I'll be back for your game, ok?

508
00:50:36,253 --> 00:50:38,073
I promise I'll be there.

509
00:50:38,628 --> 00:50:40,160
Gimme a smile.

510
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,659
I won't be long.

511
00:50:42,918 --> 00:50:45,218
Look out for tackles.

512
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,367
Let's go.

513
00:50:48,668 --> 00:50:50,968
Are the cuffs necessary?

514
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:40,429
We won! We won!

515
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:45,601
- Not at all.
- You sure?

516
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:48,184
Yeah. Will you be alright?

517
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:49,601
Yeah, I'm fine.

518
00:51:49,625 --> 00:51:51,809
I'll come tomorrow at 10, ok?

519
00:51:51,833 --> 00:51:52,744
Sure.

520
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:54,853
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

521
00:51:55,292 --> 00:51:56,292
Zina?

522
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,142
Sweetheart.

523
00:51:58,166 --> 00:51:59,725
You were perfect, habibti.

524
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:01,091
Any news from Dad?

525
00:52:01,874 --> 00:52:03,766
Yes, he's
coming home. Don't worry.

526
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:04,702
Did you film us?

527
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:06,891
I filmed it all. Listen.

528
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:09,016
Wanna sleep at Marion's?

529
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,957
No, I wanna see Dad.

530
00:52:11,541 --> 00:52:12,641
Ready to go?

531
00:52:12,665 --> 00:52:14,475
Alright, off you go.

532
00:52:14,499 --> 00:52:15,559
You'll see him tomorrow.

533
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:17,517
We'll watch the video with him.

534
00:52:17,541 --> 00:52:18,258
Thanks.

535
00:52:18,332 --> 00:52:19,818
So long.

536
00:53:53,287 --> 00:53:54,720
So?

537
00:53:54,744 --> 00:53:56,278
How'd it go?

538
00:54:06,078 --> 00:54:07,898
2 to 1 for Trappes.

539
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:15,030
She's at Marion's.

540
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,194
What for?

541
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,194
We need to talk.

542
00:54:58,826 --> 00:55:00,551
Did you film them?

543
00:55:01,993 --> 00:55:03,046
Yes.

544
00:55:23,658 --> 00:55:25,095
Fix me something?

545
00:56:16,823 --> 00:56:18,021
What about me?

546
00:56:18,865 --> 00:56:20,877
Not asking me how I am?

547
00:56:24,156 --> 00:56:25,354
I mean...

548
00:56:30,738 --> 00:56:32,131
The police in front of Zina.

549
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:34,168
- I didn't call them.
- Oh, yeah?

550
00:56:35,072 --> 00:56:36,606
Then why isn't she here?

551
00:56:36,905 --> 00:56:39,828
Why do we
need to talk? I smell a trap.

552
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:41,245
I'm leaving.

553
00:56:41,281 --> 00:56:42,631
No, Zina!

554
00:56:42,655 --> 00:56:43,673
Not without her.

555
00:56:43,697 --> 00:56:47,722
Think I'll let her
leave with a hick like you?

556
00:56:48,406 --> 00:56:49,556
See?

557
00:56:49,822 --> 00:56:52,073
You do it to yourself.

558
00:56:52,446 --> 00:56:53,549
All by yourself.

559
00:56:53,821 --> 00:56:55,929
Then you go and blame me.

560
00:56:57,572 --> 00:56:59,584
You have a short memory.

561
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:01,839
I'm warning you.

562
00:57:01,863 --> 00:57:04,066
If you leave, it's desertion.

563
00:57:04,572 --> 00:57:06,214
If you take Zina,

564
00:57:06,238 --> 00:57:07,915
it's kidnapping.

565
00:57:09,154 --> 00:57:12,124
Go share a room
in an overcrowded shelter.

566
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:45,655
Yes.

567
00:57:46,278 --> 00:57:47,332
Daddy!

568
00:57:48,278 --> 00:57:50,045
- Hey, Zina.
- We lost.

569
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:51,171
Excuse me.

570
00:57:51,444 --> 00:57:53,212
She insisted on coming home.

571
00:57:53,236 --> 00:57:56,045
I'm so sorry.
Your phone was off.

572
00:57:56,069 --> 00:57:58,369
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

573
00:57:58,611 --> 00:58:01,342
- You ok?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

574
00:58:02,403 --> 00:58:03,603
Have a nice evening.

575
00:59:05,774 --> 00:59:07,021
Thank you.

576
01:02:08,184 --> 01:02:10,005
Have a good day.

577
01:02:44,683 --> 01:02:45,738
Back off!

578
01:02:53,141 --> 01:02:55,586
Back off. Leave me alone!

579
01:02:59,683 --> 01:03:00,866
Is there a problem?

580
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:02,903
No, there's work.

581
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:05,084
It's a juvie fest.

582
01:03:05,391 --> 01:03:07,158
They'll scatter on their own.

583
01:03:07,182 --> 01:03:08,302
What's the matter?

584
01:03:08,974 --> 01:03:11,465
Could security do its job...

585
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:22,127
- Back to work?
- Yes, of course.

586
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:57,905
Leave me alone. Stop it!

587
01:04:04,847 --> 01:04:06,812
Don't touch me!

588
01:04:12,222 --> 01:04:14,425
I said leave me alone!

589
01:04:18,389 --> 01:04:19,697
Leave her alone.

590
01:04:19,721 --> 01:04:21,447
Are you nuts?

591
01:04:22,137 --> 01:04:23,623
Got a problem?

592
01:04:30,513 --> 01:04:31,854
Run for it!

593
01:05:06,845 --> 01:05:07,850
Where is it?

594
01:05:09,136 --> 01:05:10,279
What now?

595
01:05:10,303 --> 01:05:11,453
My money.

596
01:05:12,303 --> 01:05:15,278
What money? There's
no stashed money in this house.

597
01:05:15,302 --> 01:05:17,699
So we each have our own money?

598
01:05:18,094 --> 01:05:20,346
That's not why we married.

599
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:25,529
You have 30 sec to tell me where it is.

600
01:05:25,553 --> 01:05:26,989
After that, you pass out.

601
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:31,903
Mommy!

602
01:05:32,677 --> 01:05:33,945
Guess what I learned!

603
01:05:33,969 --> 01:05:35,049
Daddy's sleeping.

604
01:05:35,386 --> 01:05:36,487
Did you do it?

605
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:38,523
I'll be right there, sweetie.

606
01:05:41,884 --> 01:05:45,236
I knew you could do it! I knew it.

607
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:48,326
It was nice to see her gain confidence.

608
01:05:49,176 --> 01:05:51,956
But confidence is one thing,

609
01:05:52,343 --> 01:05:54,259
cockiness is another.

610
01:06:24,509 --> 01:06:27,287
Hi. Do you know where Zina is?

611
01:06:27,342 --> 01:06:29,642
She left with her dad.

612
01:06:29,716 --> 01:06:31,943
Ok, thank you.

613
01:06:31,967 --> 01:06:34,314
Have a nice evening. Bye.

614
01:06:39,632 --> 01:06:41,400
You've reached Dad's voicemail.

615
01:06:41,424 --> 01:06:43,275
- No, Zina...
- Leave a message!

616
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:44,354
Yeah.

617
01:06:44,550 --> 01:06:46,514
Yeah, it's me.

618
01:06:46,966 --> 01:06:49,889
Let me know
where you are. Call me back.

619
01:07:00,215 --> 01:07:01,941
You've reached Dad's voicemail.

620
01:07:01,965 --> 01:07:03,690
- No, Zina...
- Leave a message!

621
01:07:03,714 --> 01:07:04,857
Yeah, it's me.

622
01:07:04,881 --> 01:07:05,936
Where are you?

623
01:07:05,965 --> 01:07:08,409
Call me back. I
keep leaving messages.

624
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:14,066
Omar, it's me.

625
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:16,399
Call me to tell
me what you're doing.

626
01:07:16,423 --> 01:07:19,537
I could join you.
You must be having fun.

627
01:07:19,756 --> 01:07:21,912
We could have a blast together.

628
01:07:22,673 --> 01:07:24,690
Call me back.
What're you up to?

629
01:07:24,714 --> 01:07:26,273
Omar, it's me. It's me.

630
01:07:26,297 --> 01:07:27,112
Call me back.

631
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:30,148
I have her passport.
You can't go anywhere.

632
01:07:30,172 --> 01:07:32,148
And you know she'd choose me.

633
01:07:32,172 --> 01:07:34,689
Before a judge, she'd say Mommy.

634
01:07:34,713 --> 01:07:36,232
Why are you doing this?

635
01:07:36,256 --> 01:07:37,273
Let's settle this.

636
01:07:37,297 --> 01:07:38,315
You're going nowhere.

637
01:07:38,339 --> 01:07:39,773
I'm here. Call me.

638
01:07:39,797 --> 01:07:41,106
Where are you? Call me.

639
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:42,482
Call me back.

640
01:07:42,506 --> 01:07:43,559
Fast.

641
01:07:47,964 --> 01:07:50,167
- Practice!
- I can't tonight.

642
01:08:13,129 --> 01:08:14,129
Sweetheart.

643
01:08:16,754 --> 01:08:18,288
Don't leave like that.

644
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,729
- Are you ok?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

645
01:08:20,753 --> 01:08:22,575
Are you sure? Yeah?

646
01:08:24,628 --> 01:08:25,979
Where were you?

647
01:08:26,003 --> 01:08:29,021
- I left you a message.
- I didn't get a message.

648
01:08:29,045 --> 01:08:30,563
My battery died.

649
01:08:30,587 --> 01:08:31,687
Where were you?

650
01:08:31,711 --> 01:08:33,854
Hey, relax. Everything's fine.

651
01:08:33,878 --> 01:08:37,021
We went to see
the national team practice.

652
01:08:37,045 --> 01:08:39,968
And we got her
ball autographed. That's all.

653
01:08:40,795 --> 01:08:42,998
Sweetie, tell your mom to relax.

654
01:08:49,545 --> 01:08:50,550
Zina!

655
01:09:15,126 --> 01:09:17,043
Is what Daddy said true?

656
01:09:18,668 --> 01:09:20,057
What did he say?

657
01:09:20,626 --> 01:09:23,406
That you want to leave us.

658
01:09:37,334 --> 01:09:39,634
Do your homework before dinner.

659
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:55,419
Isn't that what you wanted?

660
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,458
Don't talk so much in class.

661
01:10:18,416 --> 01:10:19,519
Zina?

662
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:24,936
Say goodbye!

663
01:10:30,873 --> 01:10:33,849
A residence permit
not based on marital status

664
01:10:33,873 --> 01:10:36,030
will be issued within a month.

665
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:40,795
But it's absolutely
essential that you press charges.

666
01:10:44,457 --> 01:10:45,457
Zohra?

667
01:10:45,582 --> 01:10:49,750
If you don't, you'll
be accused of desertion.

668
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,717
He could play the victim.

669
01:10:54,082 --> 01:10:56,238
I want him to accept our separation.

670
01:10:58,373 --> 01:11:00,723
In 3 months,
school's out. Then I'll do it.

671
01:11:00,747 --> 01:11:02,713
And in the meantime?

672
01:11:04,498 --> 01:11:06,031
I'll manage.

673
01:11:35,121 --> 01:11:36,561
We're having sushi tonight.

674
01:11:41,871 --> 01:11:43,308
Look, Mommy!

675
01:11:46,247 --> 01:11:48,067
I love it, Daddy!

676
01:11:48,955 --> 01:11:51,445
Zina, not in here, sweetie.

677
01:12:01,787 --> 01:12:06,263
This means that this
summer I'm taking you to Nabeul.

678
01:12:06,287 --> 01:12:07,555
Ever heard of it?

679
01:12:07,579 --> 01:12:11,388
I'm taking you to the
beach. All day long in the sand.

680
01:12:11,412 --> 01:12:13,638
And after the swimming pool, no rest.

681
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:16,513
We'll go to the Royal Resort.

682
01:12:16,537 --> 01:12:18,789
The hotel Daddy booked.

683
01:12:19,828 --> 01:12:20,882
Look.

684
01:12:22,078 --> 01:12:23,899
What's it say?

685
01:12:27,286 --> 01:12:30,209
"Open ticket."

686
01:12:30,786 --> 01:12:32,223
What's it mean?

687
01:12:32,619 --> 01:12:34,824
That you can go visit your friend.

688
01:12:35,078 --> 01:12:37,090
- I can, really?
- Yes, really.

689
01:12:41,993 --> 01:12:43,623
Look at your mom. Excuse me...

690
01:12:43,785 --> 01:12:45,510
Is she looking jealous?

691
01:12:45,701 --> 01:12:48,886
Yes, that's the
jealous eye. I know it well.

692
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:51,636
That is the angry eye.

693
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:54,535
Am I right or am I right? I'm right.

694
01:12:54,577 --> 01:12:58,261
Angry eye rising. Almost there.

695
01:12:58,285 --> 01:12:59,291
Now!

696
01:12:59,952 --> 01:13:01,533
Now! See?

697
01:13:01,993 --> 01:13:02,993
I know her.

698
01:13:05,536 --> 01:13:07,259
Here. Give her this.

699
01:13:08,867 --> 01:13:11,024
You have a present too, Mommy.

700
01:13:21,326 --> 01:13:23,146
Aren't you opening it?

701
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:35,029
What is it?

702
01:13:41,367 --> 01:13:43,427
Martial Arts of Shaolin.

703
01:13:46,075 --> 01:13:47,656
The first time I saw your mom,

704
01:13:47,866 --> 01:13:51,172
the very first time,
she was watching that on TV.

705
01:13:51,492 --> 01:13:53,792
- Imitating all the movements.
- Really?

706
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,445
Um... Yes.

707
01:13:58,575 --> 01:14:00,426
I don't remember, sweetie.

708
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:03,084
You do! I'm sure
she does it at her gym.

709
01:14:05,449 --> 01:14:07,749
Please, Mom, can you show me?

710
01:14:07,865 --> 01:14:09,926
Sweetheart, I'm serving dinner.

711
01:14:10,282 --> 01:14:12,091
Look what Daddy set up.

712
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:15,277
The DVD's already in place.

713
01:14:18,907 --> 01:14:20,344
Eat up, sweetie.

714
01:14:27,906 --> 01:14:30,673
Omar could shower
them with gifts and sushi,

715
01:14:30,697 --> 01:14:33,669
at this point, open or closed tickets

716
01:14:33,823 --> 01:14:35,692
were no longer the issue.

717
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:55,188
Couscous doesn't hit back.

718
01:18:02,898 --> 01:18:04,048
Ok...

719
01:18:04,482 --> 01:18:05,632
sweetie.

720
01:18:05,773 --> 01:18:09,458
- You'll watch the game on the tablet.
- I don't mind.

721
01:18:09,482 --> 01:18:13,650
See you in 7 beddy-byes.
We've never been apart so long.

722
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:16,037
Love you to bits.

723
01:18:17,773 --> 01:18:19,124
Be careful, ok?

724
01:18:19,148 --> 01:18:20,308
Take care, sweetie.

725
01:18:21,065 --> 01:18:22,374
Behave, you two.

726
01:18:22,398 --> 01:18:23,874
Otherwise,

727
01:18:23,898 --> 01:18:27,683
I will come and gobble you up!

728
01:18:28,772 --> 01:18:31,024
Ok, be good!

729
01:18:31,481 --> 01:18:32,481
Love you.

730
01:18:40,147 --> 01:18:42,664
- Thanks so much.
- Don't worry, it'll go great.

731
01:18:42,688 --> 01:18:44,332
Yes, I know.

732
01:18:44,356 --> 01:18:45,457
Have fun.

733
01:18:45,481 --> 01:18:47,790
Take care of yourself. Get some rest.

734
01:18:47,814 --> 01:18:49,040
Count on me.

735
01:18:49,064 --> 01:18:51,938
- If she doesn't behave...
- I'll drown her.

736
01:18:52,646 --> 01:18:53,747
Try not to.

737
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:55,928
Ok, take care.

738
01:18:56,021 --> 01:18:57,507
Bye, Sofian.

739
01:18:59,313 --> 01:19:01,565
Bye, Mommy! Love you!

740
01:20:54,809 --> 01:20:56,485
The divorce papers.

741
01:20:57,351 --> 01:20:59,459
With a child custody proposal.

742
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,379
We have plenty of time to talk about it.

743
01:21:06,517 --> 01:21:07,332
By now,

744
01:21:07,517 --> 01:21:09,960
Zina is well on
the road with her friend.

745
01:21:11,974 --> 01:21:13,749
No need for open tickets.

746
01:22:03,847 --> 01:22:04,853
Ok.

747
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,980
If I win, you sign, no complaints.

748
01:22:17,889 --> 01:22:18,889
If you win?

749
01:22:19,722 --> 01:22:21,112
And make sure Zina...

750
01:22:30,013 --> 01:22:31,068
This isn't fair.

751
01:22:32,596 --> 01:22:34,705
Because whether you win or I win,

752
01:22:35,055 --> 01:22:37,067
I'm the one who goes to jail!

753
01:22:43,638 --> 01:22:46,513
If you win, you can
slap me around once a month.

754
01:22:50,471 --> 01:22:51,471
You're on.

755
01:23:50,219 --> 01:23:51,705
Fuck, man!

756
01:25:01,632 --> 01:25:02,830
No!

757
01:25:02,965 --> 01:25:04,307
Wait.

758
01:25:10,508 --> 01:25:12,358
- You forgot your origins.
- I know where I'm from.

759
01:25:12,382 --> 01:25:15,257
Your boss doesn't
call you "sand nigger."

760
01:25:15,549 --> 01:25:16,842
Hit him, instead.

761
01:25:38,048 --> 01:25:40,012
I can throw a leg around, too.

762
01:27:24,044 --> 01:27:25,044
Yes?

763
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:27,015
Everything ok?

764
01:27:27,668 --> 01:27:28,770
Are you sure?

765
01:27:28,794 --> 01:27:29,799
Yes!

766
01:31:06,328 --> 01:31:08,148
- You good, gorgeous?
- Yes.

767
01:31:08,203 --> 01:31:09,553
- Where ya goin'?
- Mommy's.

768
01:31:09,577 --> 01:31:11,014
- Where?
- Mommy's!

769
01:31:11,535 --> 01:31:12,886
Mommy's?

770
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:15,354
A FEW WEEKS LATER

771
01:31:15,494 --> 01:31:17,841
Off we go to Mommy's, then.

772
01:31:24,618 --> 01:31:25,480
No.

773
01:31:25,535 --> 01:31:26,638
Yes!

774
01:31:28,993 --> 01:31:30,470
Don't erase anything.

775
01:31:30,494 --> 01:31:31,882
I won't, don't worry.

776
01:31:33,452 --> 01:31:34,553
Coming.

777
01:31:36,701 --> 01:31:37,516
Hi, Mom!

778
01:31:37,575 --> 01:31:38,583
Hey, pumpkin.

779
01:31:38,617 --> 01:31:39,911
Well...

780
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:48,551
Zina's bag.

781
01:31:48,575 --> 01:31:50,828
- Should I put it here?
- Yeah.

782
01:31:51,409 --> 01:31:54,379
There's a slip to sign for Monday.

783
01:31:57,075 --> 01:31:58,178
Ok.

784
01:32:02,034 --> 01:32:03,177
Cup of coffee?

785
01:32:03,201 --> 01:32:05,134
- Sure.
- Ok.

786
01:32:05,158 --> 01:32:06,596
I'd love one.

787
01:32:31,491 --> 01:32:35,371
Sorry. Actually, I
won't have time for that coffee.

788
01:32:35,407 --> 01:32:36,796
I hope...

789
01:32:37,365 --> 01:32:38,467
Ok.

790
01:32:38,491 --> 01:32:41,701
So I'm off. I have to be somewhere.

791
01:32:42,573 --> 01:32:44,490
I'll be back on Wednesday.

792
01:32:45,907 --> 01:32:47,248
I'll call you.

793
01:32:49,449 --> 01:32:50,550
See ya.

794
01:32:51,782 --> 01:32:53,747
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, Dad!

795
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:02,492
- Mommy?
- Yes, sweetie.

796
01:33:05,031 --> 01:33:05,941
What is it?

797
01:33:05,989 --> 01:33:07,090
Listen to this.

798
01:33:07,114 --> 01:33:08,312
What is it?

799
01:33:08,614 --> 01:33:09,573
You just learned that?

800
01:33:09,614 --> 01:33:10,716
I did.

801
01:33:34,071 --> 01:33:36,276
Seriously? Is that it?

802
01:33:36,447 --> 01:33:38,506
Don't you want
to see, I don't know...

803
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:41,339
Zohra meditating?
Zohra doing tutorials?

804
01:33:41,363 --> 01:33:42,322
Or Zohra teaching?

805
01:33:42,363 --> 01:33:43,589
Knees facing forward.

806
01:33:43,613 --> 01:33:44,380
You don't?

807
01:33:44,447 --> 01:33:46,839
Can we at least see what happened

808
01:33:46,863 --> 01:33:48,506
right after Zohra messed up Omar?

809
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:49,344
Thank you.

810
01:33:49,405 --> 01:33:51,338
Recap: Zohra's
just messed up Omar,

811
01:33:51,362 --> 01:33:53,338
she hides out in her favorite spot,

812
01:33:53,362 --> 01:33:56,286
and guess who's
there? Remember them?

813
01:33:56,529 --> 01:33:57,755
Yes, them.

814
01:33:57,779 --> 01:34:00,130
The mall and parking lot thugs,

815
01:34:00,154 --> 01:34:02,755
who waited for
the final to loot stores.

816
01:34:02,779 --> 01:34:03,779
Except that...
