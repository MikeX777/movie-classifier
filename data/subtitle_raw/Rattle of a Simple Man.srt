1
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:40,501
Who do we appreciate?

2
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:43,292
U-N-I-T-E-D!

3
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,459
United!

4
00:00:44,542 --> 00:00:46,917
U-N-I-T-E-D! United!

5
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:02,001
- Hello, Mrs Winthram.
- Have you seen my son, Percy?

6
00:01:02,084 --> 00:01:03,792
Percy? He's around somewhere, love.

7
00:01:03,876 --> 00:01:05,001
- Jack!
- Yeah?

8
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:07,834
- Percy Winthram, is he with George's lot?
- Aye, he's up at the back, love.

9
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:09,667
- Second coach on the right.
- Oh, yes. Ta.

10
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:11,167
- Second coach on the right, love.
- Thank you, love.

11
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:15,334
Okay, that's your lot.

12
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:19,959
Excuse me.

13
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:22,167
Have you seen Percy Winthram?

14
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:25,084
- Percy Winthram, your mother's here.
- His what?

15
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:26,459
His mother!

16
00:01:38,584 --> 00:01:39,751
What is it, Mum?

17
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:42,834
Well, on the telly it said there were
going to be some cold winds.

18
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:46,459
- So I brought you your pullover.
- Oh, Mum, you needn't have bothered.

19
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:48,917
'Ere now, keep warm and wrapped up,
won't you, love?

20
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:49,917
Of course.

21
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:52,209
I shall miss ya.

22
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:56,834
Oh, look, Mum, go off home.
You're going to make me a laughing stock.

23
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,084
Eh, but you've forgotten your rattle.

24
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:00,584
Thanks anyway.

25
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:03,792
- Right. Ta'ra, love.
- Ta'ra. Ta'ra, love.

26
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:09,251
Did Mummy bring your dummy, lovey,
did she then?

27
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:11,834
He don't need a dummy.

28
00:02:11,917 --> 00:02:14,001
He's got his rattle!

29
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:21,917
'Ere, wh-wh-what are we
going to do, Ging?

30
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:25,417
I don't know what you're gonna do
but I know what I'm bloody after.

31
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:27,167
- What?
- Oh, what a youth!

32
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,834
- I want to see Eros.
- Eros?

33
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:30,709
- You wanna see what?
- Yeah, it's a wonderful—

34
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:32,292
Eros! Come on!

35
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:39,542
Sorry.

36
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:48,834
Come on, lads!
We've got lots of lovely girls in here!

37
00:04:48,917 --> 00:04:50,834
They're on show now.

38
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:53,709
Girls, lovely nudes, on show now.

39
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:56,667
Come on, come on. You coming in?

40
00:05:00,376 --> 00:05:02,292
I think it's disgusting.

41
00:05:02,376 --> 00:05:04,834
- Disgusting.
- It is that.

42
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:07,001
- Let's get in!
- Yeah!

43
00:05:07,084 --> 00:05:09,709
Eh! You're all married!

44
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:12,959
Can't you stop talking shop?

45
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:14,709
Let's get in, lads.

46
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,376
Come on, don't worry about him.

47
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:19,417
Come on, hurry up. Come on, Bert!

48
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:23,042
Coming in, guv?
Or shall I send you one up?

49
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:26,001
All right.

50
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:27,751
I'll have a beer.

51
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:30,334
- But nothing else.
- Okay, guv. All right.

52
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:51,751
Come on, lads.

53
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,167
Oh, look…

54
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:56,042
Ee! Don't they look lovely?

55
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:58,126
Amazing!

56
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:31,667
Eh, Ging, I-I-let's ask her to c-come
and have a d-drink with us, eh?

57
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:34,501
Oh, do me a favour.
She's common, dead common.

58
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:37,084
Well, I thought she had
a very nice smile.

59
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:39,209
Oh, bloody hell.

60
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:45,001
Eh, wait.
Now there's a bit of class.

61
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:47,876
Right, lads, she's mine.

62
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:50,626
Hey, lay off, Ging.

63
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:51,792
Why?

64
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:54,792
Well, she's a lady,
anyone can see that.

65
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:56,251
A lady?

66
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,959
I bet she's got a bedsitter
within spitting distance.

67
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:01,417
Leave this to the experts.

68
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:03,001
- Oh!
- Sorry, love.

69
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:06,167
- Did you want something, sir?
- Yeah, come with me, love.

70
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:10,084
Give this little girl five double
whiskies for us, would you, lad?

71
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:13,917
Keep the change.

72
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:20,417
Would a bonnie lass like you care to take
a drink with a handsome lad like me?

73
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:23,417
No, thanks.

74
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:25,501
Oh, come off your high horse, love.

75
00:07:26,084 --> 00:07:27,751
What's it worth to you?

76
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:31,584
I said no thanks.

77
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,292
Oh, come on, love!

78
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:34,751
Bloody hell!

79
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:36,709
You just burnt me fingers.

80
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:38,542
No, ducky, you did that.

81
00:07:50,376 --> 00:07:53,209
- Hey, what happened, Ging?
- I burnt me hand, that's what happened.

82
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:55,334
Gonna have a right blister.

83
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:58,417
The lady said don't forget
your <i>petty</i> cash.

84
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:04,126
What on earth did you say to her?

85
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:06,959
I asked her when it were high tide
at London Bridge, you twit!

86
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:09,542
I told you she were a lady.

87
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:11,459
You can't be coarse with girls like that.

88
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:13,751
- No, h-he's right, you know.
- Oh, give over.

89
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:15,251
You think you could do better?

90
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:17,667
I'd have to have me brains tested
if I couldn't.

91
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:20,001
- You want a bet?
- Bet?

92
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:22,584
- Aye, bet.
- What do you mean "bet"?

93
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,667
I'll tell you what I mean.

94
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:27,334
- Fifty quid against that motorbike of yorn.
- Oh…

95
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:29,417
Go on, Perc!

96
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:30,792
Oh, no, no.

97
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:34,667
- What, a 500cc twin-exhaust against £50?
- Mm-hm.

98
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:36,417
- £50.
- Why not?

99
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:42,251
- What would I have to do?
- Just see her home.

100
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,042
All right.

101
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,626
And sleep with her.

102
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:53,334
'Ere, better phone your mother, Perc.

103
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:55,709
No, it'll make his dad jealous.

104
00:08:57,126 --> 00:08:59,501
Eh, I'd stick to playing darts, Perc.

105
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:01,876
It's the only bull's-eye you'll ever get.

106
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:11,876
You're on!

107
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,084
You mean you'll bet?

108
00:09:14,626 --> 00:09:16,834
- Yeah.
- Right, done!

109
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:20,459
Oh, no, no, no, Perc, lad, don't.
Don't, Perc.

110
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:22,334
You've lost before you begin.

111
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:24,626
I'm as good as you lot any day!

112
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:25,917
Mind now.

113
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:27,376
- Oh…
- Bloody hell.

114
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:28,792
No chance.

115
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:49,292
Eh, do you think he'll do it?

116
00:09:49,376 --> 00:09:51,834
He's as much chance as me
becoming a bishop.

117
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:55,876
Excuse me.

118
00:09:58,626 --> 00:10:01,709
I… My name's Winthram.

119
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:04,001
Percy Winthram. I come from Manchester.

120
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:06,876
I'm sorry about Ginger.

121
00:10:07,626 --> 00:10:09,126
I hope you're not offended.

122
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:16,834
We've all come up for
the Cup Final, you know.

123
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,167
We all work in a cotton mill.

124
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,709
Research department.

125
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:24,417
Testing tensile strengths of new fabrics.

126
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,626
I went down to Manchester once.

127
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:29,167
- Up.
- Up?

128
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:32,459
You go up, to Manchester.

129
00:10:32,542 --> 00:10:34,459
Well, so long as you get there.

130
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,417
Eh? Oh, yes!

131
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:41,959
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

132
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,501
Oh, heck, I wish you would.

133
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:54,417
Ted. The gentleman insists.

134
00:10:56,376 --> 00:10:58,251
And I'll have another whisky!

135
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:07,501
Hot?

136
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,167
Yes, I am a bit.

137
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:14,084
Your hand's trembling.

138
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:15,584
I'm a bit cold as well.

139
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:27,251
- What are they waiting for?
- Who?

140
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:30,917
Oh, that's just Ginger and the lads.

141
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:34,917
Why do they call him Ginger?
His hair's brown.

142
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:38,167
Cos he's hot stuff with the girls.

143
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:40,501
Oh, he is, is he?

144
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:44,709
Oh, I've been waiting weeks for this trip.

145
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:46,792
Butterflies in the stomach.

146
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:48,542
Oh, it's daft.

147
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:52,417
We come up here every year
and, well, it's always the same.

148
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:57,917
As soon as the match is over
and Saturday's finished,

149
00:11:58,001 --> 00:11:59,334
it's all dead for me.

150
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:02,459
It's all over so soon.

151
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:03,626
Is it?

152
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:07,792
Well, there's the coach at midnight.

153
00:12:07,876 --> 00:12:10,584
Getting all cold and Sunday-ish.

154
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:14,792
And all the chaps bragging
about the beer they've drunk

155
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:16,542
and the women they've met.

156
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:19,376
Then there's the long drive home,

157
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:20,751
with the headache.

158
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:23,292
Not that I'm grumbling, you understand.

159
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:26,959
I mean, I'm an happy man.
Oh, I'm a very happy man.

160
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:29,209
But nothing to brag about, hmm?

161
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,084
Well, I do my share.

162
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,084
Then you'll need something
to brag about tonight, won't you?

163
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:39,001
Well, what do you say?

164
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:42,626
You mean it?

165
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:44,292
Why not?

166
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,042
Well, I don't know. It…

167
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:51,501
You…

168
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:55,042
Okay then, it's settled.

169
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,334
G-G-Ging!

170
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:06,667
P-P-Perc!

171
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:11,376
- Come on, lads.
- Eh, where are we going?

172
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,167
- Your cigarettes, sir.
- I w-want to buy a drink

173
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,292
for that one with the big… feathers.

174
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:17,459
Thinking of sex with my 50 quid at stake?

175
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:20,834
Obscene brute. Keep it.
Come on, lads, come on.

176
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,251
- Where shall I tell him?
- Oh, he knows.

177
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:32,292
Aye.

178
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,417
Here we go.

179
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:42,126
- Oh!
- Hey, tax—taxi!

180
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:44,876
Oh…

181
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,751
- Follow that cab!
- Eh, James Bond, exciting!

182
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:49,542
Just like television!

183
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,792
- First time in London?
- Eh?

184
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:02,626
No, I've been here before.

185
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:06,459
You've never done this before
though, have you?

186
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:07,667
What?

187
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:09,876
This.

188
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:15,959
Of course.

189
00:14:17,001 --> 00:14:18,834
Scout's honour?

190
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:20,917
I… I've had dozens of girls.

191
00:14:21,001 --> 00:14:22,209
Oh?

192
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:24,084
Millionaire, are you?

193
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:26,084
No, I wouldn't say that.

194
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:29,167
But I drew out £30 for this trip.

195
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:34,251
Well, you won't need all that, darling,
not unless you're staying the week.

196
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:37,084
Look, I have to be back
at the mill on Monday.

197
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,167
In any case, I've promised
to take me mother…

198
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:44,251
You've all got mothers, haven't you?

199
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:46,584
Behind every man is a mum.

200
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,709
Look, I act as I please.

201
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:51,167
I'm… I'm 33, you know.

202
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:53,501
You must be to have had so many girls.

203
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:21,751
Are you sure now?

204
00:15:24,584 --> 00:15:26,084
Positive.

205
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:36,876
Percy! Perc!

206
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,501
Surprise, surprise!

207
00:15:39,584 --> 00:15:42,209
We've c-come to wish you luck, Percy.

208
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:44,667
Don't do anything we wouldn't do, lad!

209
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:46,917
Remember, you've got your coach,
leaves at midnight.

210
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:50,042
And for 50 quid I expect the whole hog,
that's bet!

211
00:15:50,126 --> 00:15:52,417
Now listen, lads…

212
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:53,917
Percy.

213
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:56,667
- Are you running out on me?
- No. No!

214
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:59,459
- Of course not. I…
- Come on then!

215
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:06,417
- The whole hog, mind!
- I know, I know.

216
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:07,626
Shh!

217
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:16,084
Well, I never thought he'd get that far.

218
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:18,751
Do what? He's not up the stairs yet.

219
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:21,751
First boozer you come to, mate,
and step on it!

220
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:28,917
Well, come on, man!
Don't worry about them.

221
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:29,876
I don't.

222
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:38,334
Never a dull moment.

223
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:41,626
Up we go. I live on the top,
three flights up.

224
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:46,501
Cyrenne!

225
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:49,959
- Hi, Willie!
- Cyrenne <i>mia!</i>

226
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,417
- Mm!
- Mwah!

227
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:53,376
- Got a shilling for the meter, guv'nor?
- Er, yes, yes.

228
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,834
- How you blowing, Dad?
- Oh, I've got a cold. After last night.

229
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:59,751
Mm. Well, you shouldn't
run around with nothing on.

230
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:01,501
Strip poker was your idea!

231
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:04,459
Here's your shilling.

232
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:08,542
Oh!

233
00:17:08,626 --> 00:17:10,042
I like him.

234
00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:12,459
He's a genuine antique. Mmm!

235
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:13,709
You wait!

236
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:15,376
- Just you wait!
- Love!

237
00:17:18,626 --> 00:17:20,417
Come on.

238
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:28,584
You can get out. I've got enough
to put up with without that.

239
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,334
Hi, Sally. Trouble?

240
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,209
- Pay no attention to him.
- You sure?

241
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:34,084
I should think not.

242
00:17:38,042 --> 00:17:41,126
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go on, pop off!

243
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,667
Well, come in, darling.
I'm not going to eat you.

244
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:26,876
Well, make yourself at home.

245
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:53,251
I…

246
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:06,292
Don't we… sort of talk or anything?

247
00:19:07,126 --> 00:19:08,542
What for?

248
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:11,251
Well… you know.

249
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:15,626
I just thought we could…

250
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:18,334
You know.

251
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,459
What's the matter, darling?

252
00:19:21,542 --> 00:19:23,084
Have you lost your courage?

253
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:24,292
No.

254
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:25,667
Not at all.

255
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,084
I'm game for anything.

256
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:31,709
And anything goes, eh, darlin'?

257
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:33,209
Whoo!

258
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,751
Are you married?

259
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:39,667
No, you're not, are you?

260
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:42,792
Well, go on.

261
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:48,667
I won't look.

262
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:57,001
- Well, don't be shy.
- I'm not.

263
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:06,376
It's… It's just… Well…

264
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:07,709
It's just…

265
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:13,834
It… It seems so cold-bloodied, so to speak.

266
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:16,876
Well, it's a question of time,
isn't it, darling?

267
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:20,042
I mean, we can't meet the family
and go for walks, not in half an hour.

268
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:22,042
But I don't mind.

269
00:20:22,126 --> 00:20:25,792
Look, nobody's forcing you to make love.

270
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:29,626
I mean, if you'd rather,
we'll make a pot of tea and then,

271
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:31,959
- when you're ready, you can scoot.
- I'm not.

272
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:35,126
- Not what?
- I'm not paying for nothing.

273
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:37,667
Who asked you to?

274
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:40,042
Who even mentioned money?!

275
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:43,667
- Well, I naturally expected…
- Good!

276
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,667
You pay for my time, don't you?

277
00:20:46,751 --> 00:20:50,334
I don't give a damn how you spend it,
but you pay for it.

278
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:00,792
- I get the cash, you get the key.
- I…

279
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:02,292
Ooh!

280
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,501
I feel umpty.

281
00:21:05,584 --> 00:21:07,167
I really do!

282
00:21:08,626 --> 00:21:10,751
I've got a splitting headache.

283
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:12,917
Oh!

284
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:17,167
What a comedown.

285
00:21:17,251 --> 00:21:19,709
Shaking his rattle,
tossing his hat in the air.

286
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,417
"See you tomorrow, lads!

287
00:21:21,501 --> 00:21:24,792
Don't tell Mother,
you might make Dad jealous.

288
00:21:24,876 --> 00:21:26,167
Up the Wrens!"

289
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,542
Marvellous!

290
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:32,459
Could I have a glass of water
and an aspirin, please?

291
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:35,251
Oh! Everybody's Romeo.

292
00:21:35,334 --> 00:21:36,751
Ooh!

293
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:43,209
And don't be sick on my bed.

294
00:21:44,126 --> 00:21:45,126
Here.

295
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:47,126
Ta.

296
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:50,834
Ooh! Me head's
full of little men with hammers.

297
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:59,292
I'm sorry I lost me nerve just now.

298
00:21:59,376 --> 00:22:01,126
Ah, think nothing of it.

299
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:06,709
Will you tell your mother
about your naughty night?

300
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,209
Don't be so daft.

301
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:10,917
What about the lads, Percy,
what'll you tell them?

302
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:12,084
Well…

303
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:17,001
Yes, you think about it, Percy.

304
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:19,251
I often do with fellas like you.

305
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:22,209
Do you say,

306
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:24,876
"I'm glad I didn't,"
people like you, Percy?

307
00:22:26,084 --> 00:22:30,084
Or does the story expand
into dark brown chuckles?

308
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:32,126
"Oh, ho-ho! What a night, eh?

309
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:34,667
What a night, chaps!"

310
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:37,584
Well, Percy?

311
00:22:41,584 --> 00:22:43,417
I don't know what to say.

312
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:47,959
I… I've never spoken to a lady
like this before.

313
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:50,251
I mean, you're so blunt.

314
00:22:50,334 --> 00:22:52,417
Won't you be blunt with Ginger?

315
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:55,126
Well, that's between men.

316
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:57,626
And this is between people.
Aren't men people?

317
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,792
Well, yes, but…

318
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:03,417
Why do you do this sort of thing?

319
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:07,709
What sort of thing?

320
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:08,792
Well…

321
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,251
I suppose everybody asks you that.

322
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:13,876
Mm-hmm.

323
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,417
Usually bank managers
who are writing plays.

324
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:19,667
Or Bible punchers with helping hands.

325
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:22,584
Oh, yes. One of them calls every Thursday.

326
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:26,834
Pair of watery eyes,
begs to hear my problems. Oh, brother!

327
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:32,001
He may be a kindly person who's
genuinely interested in your welfare.

328
00:23:32,626 --> 00:23:34,876
Yes, Percival.

329
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:38,667
Like the time he asked me
to undress while he listened.

330
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,834
Well…

331
00:23:40,917 --> 00:23:43,876
there were only genuine interest
in my question.

332
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:46,959
I'm not perverted.

333
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:49,001
I've no problems.

334
00:23:49,084 --> 00:23:50,167
Haven't you?

335
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:54,084
Now, look, miss, you asked me…
Well, as good as.

336
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:56,626
In that club. "Come along," you said.

337
00:23:56,709 --> 00:23:59,334
- Well, it wasn't at gunpoint, you know.
- No, but…

338
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:02,751
Well, I was tipsy.

339
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:04,542
I was a bit merry.

340
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:06,459
Now, if you must know…

341
00:24:07,334 --> 00:24:09,709
I feel very ashamed.

342
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:13,501
Oh! You're ashamed?

343
00:24:13,584 --> 00:24:15,751
Well, that's marvellous!

344
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:21,084
I can just see you in Manchester
in that pub tomorrow night.

345
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:24,417
They'll be Ginger and Chalky and Fred,

346
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:28,001
and they'll be you in the middle
looking ashamed.

347
00:24:28,084 --> 00:24:33,209
"Ee, I was so ashamed, Ginger,"
says Percival.

348
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:39,251
And Ginger says, "Oh, I'm proud
that you was ashamed, Percival."

349
00:24:39,334 --> 00:24:42,626
And then all the gentlemen
join hands and shout,

350
00:24:42,709 --> 00:24:45,751
"Good old, Percy, pass the Bible!"

351
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:49,334
I tell you, he will never do it,
you mark my words.

352
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:53,209
- Oh, you s-shouldn't be t-too sure, Ging.
- What? He stands no chance!

353
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:57,917
But how would you know? I mean, you've
got no proof if he says he has and he hasn't.

354
00:24:58,001 --> 00:25:00,709
No, I mean, you c-can't
catch him in fl… in flagra-gra…

355
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:02,417
Oh, shut up, Chalky.

356
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:06,042
Listen, I've known Perc all his life.
He lives next door.

357
00:25:06,126 --> 00:25:10,459
As far as women are concerned,
his braces is strapped round his ears.

358
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:13,126
I mean, look at the way he lives his life.
Bloody hell.

359
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:15,792
Monday he takes his mother to the pictures.

360
00:25:15,876 --> 00:25:19,292
Tuesday it's billiards.
Wednesday he cleans his bike.

361
00:25:19,376 --> 00:25:21,001
My bike now.

362
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:23,709
Thursday it's telly at my place
and Friday it's darts.

363
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:25,209
I know!

364
00:25:25,292 --> 00:25:27,459
Have you ever seen Percy
with a bird, have you?

365
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:29,042
- Well-well-well…
- Shut up!

366
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:30,709
Have you?

367
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:32,917
You never know when they're
going to break out though.

368
00:25:33,001 --> 00:25:35,376
Oh, don't give me that!

369
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:36,959
Hey, love.

370
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:39,042
How many boozers
between here and Victoria?

371
00:25:39,126 --> 00:25:41,084
Oh, about 87 as the crow flies.

372
00:25:41,167 --> 00:25:43,917
- Well, come on, lads, another 86 to go.
- Eh!

373
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,751
- Oh! Come on.
- Marvellous!

374
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:48,542
- Hang on!
- Marvellous.

375
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:55,709
I… I'd just like to say…

376
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:59,501
Oh, I feel awful about this, Cyrenne.

377
00:26:00,334 --> 00:26:01,792
Truly ashamed.

378
00:26:03,167 --> 00:26:04,876
Oh! Well, get you.

379
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:07,751
I suppose you think you're slumming
mixing with me?

380
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:10,626
You with your "ee ba gum"
and your "up for the Cup".

381
00:26:11,376 --> 00:26:13,292
It just so happens

382
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:17,751
that I have travelled the world
and I speak three languages.

383
00:26:19,126 --> 00:26:21,626
I went to Oxford, with honours.

384
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:23,917
I'm an M.A., if you wish me to boast.

385
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:25,376
Really?!

386
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,376
That's very good.

387
00:26:27,459 --> 00:26:31,542
My father was a general
and my brother runs a country club.

388
00:26:31,626 --> 00:26:33,876
I was brought up with people like that.

389
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,542
£30? Huh!

390
00:26:35,626 --> 00:26:39,334
I've spent your £30 on a hat
or on a… a sudden whim.

391
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:44,126
Believe me, I don't give a
galloping damn if you die of shame,

392
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:47,001
or disappear in ever decreasing circles.

393
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:53,751
I must have drunk some stuff tonight.

394
00:26:56,292 --> 00:26:58,376
Eh, seven pints.

395
00:26:59,209 --> 00:27:00,626
And as many whiskies.

396
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:08,792
Is this just a cupboard here?

397
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:10,459
Yes.

398
00:27:11,584 --> 00:27:12,542
Oh.

399
00:27:15,042 --> 00:27:17,126
Seven pints.

400
00:27:25,626 --> 00:27:27,834
You… Er, excuse me.

401
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,834
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh…

402
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,417
It's no trouble.

403
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,626
It's a nice kitchen.

404
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:55,626
Yes, I'm glad you like it.

405
00:27:56,501 --> 00:27:58,001
I own this house, you know.

406
00:27:58,084 --> 00:27:59,626
I bought the mortgage.

407
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,542
Eh, you're lucky.

408
00:28:02,626 --> 00:28:04,626
I wish I owned a house.

409
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:11,667
Do you have a bathroom here?

410
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:13,001
Er, no.

411
00:28:13,084 --> 00:28:14,209
Oh…

412
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:18,751
There's one on the landing below!

413
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:20,084
Oh, thank you!

414
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:21,959
Oh, Percy!

415
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:23,292
Yes?

416
00:28:23,376 --> 00:28:25,001
Key!

417
00:28:25,084 --> 00:28:26,542
Oh, thanks.

418
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:39,834
- 'Ere, what the hell…
- Er, excuse me.

419
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:52,626
Oh, so sorry. I'm so sorry.

420
00:29:02,126 --> 00:29:03,917
I can't take this anymore.

421
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:07,876
Don't be daft, you'll ruin everything
if you interfere now!

422
00:29:10,126 --> 00:29:11,334
It's not locked.

423
00:29:14,876 --> 00:29:16,542
You might have said straight away.

424
00:29:16,626 --> 00:29:18,667
Well, you might have asked straight away.

425
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:23,292
It's not the sort of thing a gentleman
or a manly person does.

426
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:26,417
- Up in Scunthorpe, you mean?
- Anywhere.

427
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:30,584
Oh, well, we do it in London all the time.

428
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:33,376
And it's not Scunthorpe, it's Manchester.

429
00:29:36,459 --> 00:29:37,751
What's the time?

430
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:40,042
Quarter past nine.

431
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:41,417
Quarter past nine.

432
00:29:43,251 --> 00:29:44,459
Why?

433
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:46,376
Income tax.

434
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:14,751
You have quite a nice figure.

435
00:30:14,834 --> 00:30:17,501
- Quite nice hair too.
- I'm glad you like it.

436
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:21,084
Yes. Well…

437
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:25,376
Thanks for the glass of water
and the aspirin.

438
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:28,084
It was very nice of you.

439
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:31,501
As a matter of fact,

440
00:30:31,584 --> 00:30:34,334
I think you must be a very nice person.

441
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,084
Underneath it all.

442
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,917
Yes. Er, no!

443
00:30:40,751 --> 00:30:42,751
I really mean that.

444
00:30:42,834 --> 00:30:47,001
I… I've never talked with anyone
as interesting as you.

445
00:30:47,084 --> 00:30:51,126
You see, you don't often
meet girls who are original.

446
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:52,834
And you certainly are.

447
00:30:53,876 --> 00:30:58,167
I don't think I've ever had
such an interesting night, never.

448
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:02,917
Go and light the gas under the kettle,
we'll have a nice cup of tea, eh, love?

449
00:31:03,001 --> 00:31:04,917
Oh! Thanks.

450
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:10,792
Be all right here, will they?

451
00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:12,876
No, put it on the one next door.

452
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,417
But there isn't one…

453
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:19,167
You do say some weird things,
you do really.

454
00:31:22,251 --> 00:31:25,001
What I really need is a good cup of tea.

455
00:31:26,209 --> 00:31:29,501
Well, that lets me out,
doesn't it?

456
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:34,209
Oh, there's some biscuits,
if you'd like some, on the shelf.

457
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:41,042
There's only two.

458
00:31:41,126 --> 00:31:42,876
One each, lovely!

459
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:24,959
Oh, heck!

460
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:28,584
Let's have a double whisky apiece.
Come on, come on.

461
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:30,709
We only got beer on your round.

462
00:32:32,376 --> 00:32:35,334
- I'll pay.
- I should bloody well think so.

463
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:38,334
- Must water the horse.
- Oh!

464
00:32:51,376 --> 00:32:54,542
That's not asking, that's begging.
Just get him outside.

465
00:32:55,751 --> 00:32:57,959
I'll do better than that.

466
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,959
I'll bring him home for you.

467
00:33:03,084 --> 00:33:05,917
I wonder if Perc has given up yet.

468
00:33:08,084 --> 00:33:10,376
Fred, a packet of fags.

469
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,584
Don't look, but I'm getting the eye.

470
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:27,709
- Getting the eye?
- Bloody shut up!

471
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:30,584
The only time you don't stutter
you drop a clanger.

472
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:31,792
Eh, Ozzie.

473
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:35,792
I'm getting the eye.
Don't look, don't look!

474
00:33:36,459 --> 00:33:38,459
Tell me what she's like.

475
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:39,834
Where?

476
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:42,209
Standing by the bar, over yonder.

477
00:33:42,876 --> 00:33:44,417
Sit down, you nit!

478
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,126
Well?

479
00:33:47,209 --> 00:33:48,834
Cor, smashing.

480
00:33:49,584 --> 00:33:53,334
Right, lads, I think I've just got time
for a little slap and tickle.

481
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:55,834
Oh, G-Ging, remember your wife.

482
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:58,001
I'm on holiday, aren't I?

483
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:05,917
Excuse me, miss, you don't mind me asking
but haven't I seen you on the telly?

484
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:20,667
Cyrenne?

485
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:23,667
- Where are you?
- Out here.

486
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:31,626
Cuckoo!

487
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:33,584
- Cuckoo, cuckoo.
- What are you doing?

488
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:36,417
Talking to Thingummy and Whatsit.

489
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:39,209
Oh, hello! Cheep-cheep.

490
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:41,417
Cheep-cheep, cheep-cheep.

491
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:42,792
Oh, hello.

492
00:34:42,876 --> 00:34:44,834
- Cuckoo!
- Hey.

493
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:47,334
This is really something.

494
00:34:48,334 --> 00:34:51,167
Eh, it's just like Hollywood.

495
00:34:51,251 --> 00:34:54,042
- Hello, cheep-cheep.
- Cuckoo, cuckoo.

496
00:34:54,751 --> 00:34:56,126
Cuckoo.

497
00:34:57,042 --> 00:35:01,917
Why did you call them Thingummy and Whatsit?

498
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,709
Because one's a boy and one's a girl,

499
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:07,876
and only they know which.

500
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:10,084
Then how do you know they are?

501
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:12,917
Because they spend all their time
kissing each other.

502
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,167
Get away!

503
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:17,501
- Do they?
- Hmm.

504
00:35:19,459 --> 00:35:20,834
Would you like a biscuit?

505
00:35:21,542 --> 00:35:23,792
- Are you sure you can spare it?
- Of course.

506
00:35:23,876 --> 00:35:25,084
Thank you.

507
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:42,417
Do you have normal meals?

508
00:35:43,084 --> 00:35:44,792
No, they give us special food.

509
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,917
- No, I meant—
- Extra vitamins.

510
00:35:47,001 --> 00:35:48,876
Erm, technicolour pills.

511
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:54,167
What I meant was, do you have
lunches and suppers and… Oh, forget it!

512
00:35:55,209 --> 00:35:58,209
I'm sorry, pet. Sorry!

513
00:35:59,084 --> 00:36:00,792
I'm not sulking.

514
00:36:00,876 --> 00:36:02,459
I don't sulk.

515
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:03,917
Well, good.

516
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:08,584
Have you…

517
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,542
Do you have any parents?

518
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:14,001
Not anymore.

519
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:15,376
What happened?

520
00:36:16,626 --> 00:36:20,959
My mother died when I was 12
and my father shortly after.

521
00:36:21,042 --> 00:36:22,126
Ah!

522
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:24,751
What do you mean "ah!"?

523
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:26,751
I… I can see now…

524
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:29,126
You don't have to be sorry for me.

525
00:36:30,876 --> 00:36:33,209
We were perfectly brought up.

526
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:37,042
We had old family retainers who
looked after us, my brother and me.

527
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:42,334
We lived in a huge, stone-flagged mansion
in Hampshire.

528
00:36:43,626 --> 00:36:47,626
As a child I remember
the upward-sweeping bannisters.

529
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:49,667
Velvet walls.

530
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:53,084
Mmm! The smell of mahogany.

531
00:36:54,001 --> 00:36:58,084
I never really knew my father.
He was always away fighting.

532
00:36:58,167 --> 00:37:01,042
- Fighting who?
- Oh, I don't know. Fighting anybody.

533
00:37:02,209 --> 00:37:04,959
I spent my time painting and writing.

534
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:07,417
I designed all this, you know.

535
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:10,626
And when I was 14, I wrote a book.

536
00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:12,459
Thirty chapters.

537
00:37:13,126 --> 00:37:14,917
And when I was 12…

538
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:17,667
I did something else.

539
00:37:21,209 --> 00:37:23,626
I do hope I'm not keeping you up.

540
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:29,459
Well, I am usually in bed by this time,
but tonight I feel like dancing.

541
00:37:30,126 --> 00:37:31,751
Can you dance?

542
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:35,667
As a matter of fact,
I used to run a dancing school.

543
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:39,542
- Really?
- Don't be so soft. Of course I didn't!

544
00:37:39,626 --> 00:37:41,917
You make me so mad
the things you say.

545
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:45,834
It wasn't, "Shall we dance?" or,
"Let's dance." It was, "Can you?"

546
00:37:45,917 --> 00:37:49,084
- Well, not everyone can dance.
- Well, I can.

547
00:37:50,626 --> 00:37:54,709
You make me feel as if I've come
up the Thames on a pogo stick.

548
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:58,459
Every topic that crops up,
you've got the cupboardful.

549
00:37:59,417 --> 00:38:02,834
Family retainers, mahogany and generals.

550
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:05,334
You paint and you write.

551
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:08,584
- Thirty chapters?
- Well, it wasn't a very good book.

552
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:10,626
- At 14?
- Terribly immature.

553
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:12,667
"Premature" would be a better word.

554
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:17,417
Takes me half an hour
to sign a Christmas card.

555
00:38:17,501 --> 00:38:21,126
Ooh, never mind!

556
00:38:21,209 --> 00:38:24,167
You do all that clever research stuff
at the mill.

557
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:28,626
Oh, I… I only collate the figures
the boffins have turned out.

558
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:32,834
Oh, I suppose I am clever enough
at figures.

559
00:38:32,917 --> 00:38:36,459
But you wouldn't want to spend the night
joining figures together, would you?

560
00:38:36,542 --> 00:38:38,501
Not on paper.

561
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:45,042
It's all right, I know what you mean.

562
00:38:45,709 --> 00:38:47,084
And that's another thing.

563
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:51,667
I wouldn't do or say things to the women
at the mill like you say to me.

564
00:38:51,751 --> 00:38:53,751
Well, you might have more fun
if you did.

565
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:57,376
Look, I'm no prude, you know.
Don't think that.

566
00:38:57,459 --> 00:38:59,584
I'm 33, you know.

567
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:02,251
I've been out with plenty of women, plenty.

568
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:05,834
You've never slept with one though,
have you?

569
00:39:05,917 --> 00:39:07,126
You're…

570
00:39:08,167 --> 00:39:11,834
You're a right devil! You're so cheeky.

571
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:15,792
I reckon you'd walk into Marks & Spencer's
and shout, "Woolworths!"

572
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:17,917
Well, don't you think
it's about time you did?

573
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:19,584
Did what?

574
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:21,209
Oh…

575
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:24,542
All right.

576
00:39:24,626 --> 00:39:27,459
I am like a chaplet peg with women.

577
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:29,292
But I'm not worried.

578
00:39:29,376 --> 00:39:30,584
I'm average.

579
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,584
You're stretching it a bit
at 33, aren't you?

580
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:35,626
No, I'm not!

581
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:38,834
The people you meet aren't a cross-section.

582
00:39:38,917 --> 00:39:44,584
I believe there are lots of folk like me
who haven't the facets for making friends.

583
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:47,792
Doesn't mean we have to go round
writing on walls, you know.

584
00:39:47,876 --> 00:39:51,251
I'm not warped or retarded.
If anything, it's you.

585
00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:54,876
Me?!

586
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,376
Well, thank you very much!

587
00:40:01,209 --> 00:40:03,626
I'm sorry if I said anything to annoy you.

588
00:40:03,709 --> 00:40:08,084
- But you could hardly appreciate how I feel.
- Then ram this past your halo, Percy.

589
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:12,167
I'm no different from anyone else.
I eat ordinary food.

590
00:40:12,251 --> 00:40:15,792
I wear my best clothes in church and I
never read dirty books before breakfast.

591
00:40:16,626 --> 00:40:18,376
You don't half take offence.

592
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,084
Hey…

593
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:25,501
- You're not crying, are you?
- Oh, no, of course not.

594
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:30,834
It's just that I wouldn't like to leave you,
well, you know.

595
00:40:33,751 --> 00:40:35,709
Everyone leaves me "well, you know".

596
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:38,792
Sometimes they'd swagger.

597
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:41,501
Sometimes they bluster.

598
00:40:42,126 --> 00:40:44,001
But mostly they just creep away.

599
00:40:52,959 --> 00:40:54,751
Would you like another cup of tea?

600
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,334
He's good for me, Mama!

601
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:06,709
He's awful good!

602
00:41:19,251 --> 00:41:20,376
Percy.

603
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:24,001
Are you a Scout master?

604
00:41:27,459 --> 00:41:29,542
What'd be wrong in that?

605
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:36,876
- What's that?
- That's for me. I'm wanted.

606
00:41:39,251 --> 00:41:41,792
How are you? Come in.

607
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:43,917
Hey, what's cooking?

608
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,917
Food and drink, my sweet.
Nectar and ambrosia.

609
00:41:47,001 --> 00:41:48,501
We've got a whole ham, look!

610
00:41:48,584 --> 00:41:50,751
Wow!

611
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:52,709
- Yeah!
- Whee!

612
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:54,959
- Smell that. Paella.
- Eurgh!

613
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:58,167
- You'll be dog sick.
- Fair enough. We'll bring up the past together.

614
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:01,626
- Well…
- Oh, come on.

615
00:42:01,709 --> 00:42:04,001
A party isn't a party without my Cyrenne <i>mia.</i>

616
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:07,292
Well, hang on a second. I'll find out.

617
00:42:07,376 --> 00:42:08,501
Come on! Hey!

618
00:42:09,459 --> 00:42:10,667
Percy!

619
00:42:15,501 --> 00:42:18,209
Look, darling, do you really want to stay?

620
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:20,459
Well, I don't want to stop you.

621
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:23,042
- Yes.
- Whatever happens?

622
00:42:28,792 --> 00:42:31,917
- No go, Willie, my boyfriend won't let me.
- Tell him to come too!

623
00:42:32,001 --> 00:42:35,126
That's sweet of you, Willie,
but he prefers a nice cup of tea.

624
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:37,167
Have a good time, darling.

625
00:42:42,167 --> 00:42:45,251
- There.
- Look, I don't want to stop you having…

626
00:42:45,334 --> 00:42:48,084
Well, you said you wanted
to stay, didn't you?

627
00:42:55,292 --> 00:42:57,084
Come on, I'm waiting.

628
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:08,501
Well, come on, let's have you, man!

629
00:43:17,459 --> 00:43:19,709
Oh, come on, Percival!

630
00:43:21,126 --> 00:43:22,417
It's no use, I can't dance.

631
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:28,167
Well, I'll be damned.

632
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:31,417
And you made such a hell of a scene
when I said the wrong thing.

633
00:43:31,501 --> 00:43:32,751
I know.

634
00:43:32,834 --> 00:43:34,292
I told a lie.

635
00:43:34,376 --> 00:43:37,917
It's just I wanted to say there was
something I could do, that's why.

636
00:43:39,001 --> 00:43:42,667
Oh! Well, you know I gave up
a really swinging party

637
00:43:42,751 --> 00:43:45,417
with lashings of booze for you, darling?

638
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:46,876
Nobody twisted your arm.

639
00:43:50,084 --> 00:43:51,542
Do you play tiddlywinks?

640
00:43:52,501 --> 00:43:55,501
No, I do not play tiddlywinks.

641
00:43:56,459 --> 00:43:58,709
- You play darts though.
- Yes.

642
00:43:59,876 --> 00:44:03,042
Why, have you got a dartboard?

643
00:44:03,126 --> 00:44:04,459
Oh!

644
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:33,042
Well, Percival, what <i>are</i> we going to do?

645
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,876
Go!

646
00:44:39,959 --> 00:44:42,376
One, two, three, four…

647
00:44:42,459 --> 00:44:44,501
- Get it in, Chalky. Go on. Come on.
- Six, seven…

648
00:44:44,584 --> 00:44:46,417
Eight, nine, ten!

649
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:48,251
- He's done it!
- Chalky, that was very good.

650
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:49,959
- Can you do another one? Come on.
- Oh!

651
00:44:50,042 --> 00:44:52,251
- I bet you can't.
- Me eyeballs are filling with froth!

652
00:44:52,334 --> 00:44:53,376
Come on…

653
00:44:53,459 --> 00:44:56,667
Ah, I did no more than any
of the other lads in battle.

654
00:44:56,751 --> 00:45:00,792
I didn't want a decoration but the Queen insisted.
'Ere, have another drink.

655
00:45:00,876 --> 00:45:03,209
Oh, no, really, I'm well on the way as it is.

656
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:06,251
- You are? Well, have another.
- No, no.

657
00:45:06,334 --> 00:45:08,709
Come on, tell me some more of your stories.

658
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:12,417
Oh, I've got a multitude of interesting tales,

659
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,876
but, ah, there's such a noise in here.

660
00:45:17,042 --> 00:45:19,209
And rather vulgar.

661
00:45:19,292 --> 00:45:23,084
Yes, well, erm,
we could go back to my flat but…

662
00:45:23,167 --> 00:45:27,334
Oh, no, no. I would not dream of imposing.

663
00:45:27,417 --> 00:45:29,667
- You wouldn't?
- No, no!

664
00:45:29,751 --> 00:45:31,417
- How far is it?
- Just round the corner.

665
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:32,751
Well, what are we waiting for?

666
00:45:32,834 --> 00:45:34,542
- Let's have one for the road. Come on.
- You are an old button.

667
00:45:34,626 --> 00:45:36,334
'Ere, miss.

668
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:40,042
Give me a double gin
in a small-looking glass.

669
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,042
I've never had so much fun, never!

670
00:45:57,084 --> 00:45:58,917
- Ah!
- Ah-ha!

671
00:45:59,001 --> 00:46:01,209
Ah, I've done it again!

672
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:04,209
Brains, boy, that's your strongpoint.

673
00:46:06,709 --> 00:46:10,626
Oh, who are we fooling?
It only gets worse like this.

674
00:46:11,376 --> 00:46:13,376
Don't worry, my pet.

675
00:46:13,459 --> 00:46:17,709
She'll come one day and your
trembling lips will blossom into poe…

676
00:46:17,792 --> 00:46:20,834
Ooh, where are my blasted tissues?

677
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:29,376
Oh, she'll come and <i>she</i> won't laugh.

678
00:46:29,459 --> 00:46:31,542
Well, she's taking a heck of a time.

679
00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:33,126
What, at 33?

680
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:36,751
No, beautiful age, everyone says so, beautiful.

681
00:46:36,834 --> 00:46:39,959
She'll come from somewhere, sometime.

682
00:46:40,042 --> 00:46:41,626
Maybe tomorrow.

683
00:46:43,042 --> 00:46:48,792
Ah, just imagine, sweet 33 and still
full of excitement and naughty thoughts.

684
00:46:49,792 --> 00:46:53,376
Ah, I can't remember my first kiss
or my first dance.

685
00:46:53,459 --> 00:46:56,167
I've been kissing and dancing since…

686
00:46:56,251 --> 00:46:58,209
Oh, God knows! Since Adam.

687
00:47:01,959 --> 00:47:05,334
I painted a picture of a naked boy
when I was 12.

688
00:47:06,376 --> 00:47:09,376
- Oh, I daresay we all—
- From life, darling.

689
00:47:10,209 --> 00:47:13,792
I made this kid strip off and pose
by an old water butt.

690
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:18,001
Anyway, it rained and he caught a cold.

691
00:47:18,084 --> 00:47:19,959
I took the painting to school.

692
00:47:20,042 --> 00:47:22,751
Oh, I caused a scandal, a riot, in fact.

693
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:26,709
You should have seen the teachers.
My dear, they sent me home.

694
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:30,959
They telephoned my parents. Reporters came.
Big splash in the local rag.

695
00:47:31,042 --> 00:47:33,251
Altogether it was a bloody good do.

696
00:47:33,334 --> 00:47:35,251
Did you say "parents"?

697
00:47:35,334 --> 00:47:38,084
Oh, my step-mother.
My father married again.

698
00:47:38,167 --> 00:47:41,251
Well, by the time I was 16
I was really whopping it up.

699
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:45,376
You've really had quite a life, haven't you?

700
00:47:45,459 --> 00:47:47,417
I wish you'd give me a few tips.

701
00:47:49,584 --> 00:47:51,042
Come here, love.

702
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:58,792
Tell me.

703
00:48:01,959 --> 00:48:04,959
Well, there's nothing to tell,
that's the trouble.

704
00:48:06,542 --> 00:48:09,709
Well, I live with, er, family, you see.

705
00:48:09,792 --> 00:48:12,959
I must get somewhere on my own.
It's time I did.

706
00:48:14,251 --> 00:48:18,126
I mean, you can't take friends
back home, really.

707
00:48:18,209 --> 00:48:21,251
There's only the spare parlour
and, even if I did,

708
00:48:21,334 --> 00:48:23,876
me mum would make it a ceremony.

709
00:48:23,959 --> 00:48:28,126
You know, fussing and bringing out
the posh spoons and dressing up.

710
00:48:28,959 --> 00:48:32,001
I'm not grousing.
Me mum's a wonderful woman.

711
00:48:32,084 --> 00:48:34,417
Oh, she's wonderful but…

712
00:48:35,126 --> 00:48:38,959
Well, I once took home
a girl called Cherry.

713
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:41,501
Just a friend, nothing more.

714
00:48:41,584 --> 00:48:43,334
But what a palaver.

715
00:48:43,417 --> 00:48:46,126
There's me mum twittering away.

716
00:48:46,209 --> 00:48:49,709
Nudging me father.
Little sidelong looks at each other.

717
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:51,542
Ah! I froze up.

718
00:48:51,626 --> 00:48:54,376
I mean, you don't know.

719
00:48:54,459 --> 00:48:58,167
You've got to be sure before you
bring the posh spoons out.

720
00:48:58,917 --> 00:49:00,709
Anyway, I froze up.

721
00:49:01,334 --> 00:49:02,834
And Cherry?

722
00:49:02,917 --> 00:49:04,417
She crystallised.

723
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:07,834
I didn't see her for dust.

724
00:49:09,084 --> 00:49:11,042
And what about all those other dates?

725
00:49:12,042 --> 00:49:15,751
Well, everything goes fine
until near the end.

726
00:49:15,834 --> 00:49:17,834
Then it's always the same.

727
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:22,626
That same, long, agonising walk
back to their gate.

728
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:26,292
Oh, truly agonising, believe me.

729
00:49:26,959 --> 00:49:30,209
Talk about a dumb-bell.
I mean, it's got blood compared to me.

730
00:49:31,959 --> 00:49:36,001
I worry about this goodnight kissing
all the way to the gate.

731
00:49:36,084 --> 00:49:37,959
Well, can't it wait until the next night?

732
00:49:39,417 --> 00:49:41,334
I'm afraid not.

733
00:49:41,417 --> 00:49:43,417
I don't get a return match.

734
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:48,792
Mind you, I've done plenty of ordinary kissing.

735
00:49:48,876 --> 00:49:51,251
At parties and, well…

736
00:49:52,417 --> 00:49:55,001
Just at parties, I suppose.

737
00:49:57,126 --> 00:49:59,876
But when I get to that gate…

738
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:06,126
and she says thanks for a nice evening
or some such phrase,

739
00:50:06,209 --> 00:50:08,459
and I know she's expecting…

740
00:50:09,584 --> 00:50:13,167
she's expecting me to get romantic.

741
00:50:13,751 --> 00:50:16,001
Oh, everything goes to pot.

742
00:50:18,334 --> 00:50:20,792
Can't you let yourself go for once?

743
00:50:23,334 --> 00:50:25,209
I did for once.

744
00:50:27,001 --> 00:50:28,917
And the girl laughed and she said…

745
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:31,292
Oh!

746
00:50:31,376 --> 00:50:33,084
What? Said what?

747
00:50:34,917 --> 00:50:36,501
She said…

748
00:50:36,584 --> 00:50:39,876
"You'd better stick to training
Boy Scouts, Percy."

749
00:50:41,292 --> 00:50:43,042
I am…

750
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:45,001
You guessed it right.

751
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,751
I am a Scout master.

752
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:49,834
What's wrong with it?

753
00:50:49,917 --> 00:50:54,209
I'm fed up of being embarrassed
when I tell people about it.

754
00:50:55,709 --> 00:50:58,792
Oh, life's a mess, it really is.

755
00:50:58,876 --> 00:51:03,209
Oh, don't worry, my pet.
It'll all sort itself out.

756
00:51:03,292 --> 00:51:06,209
You know what?
I even asked Ginger.

757
00:51:07,084 --> 00:51:11,042
He's a smooth type, you know.

758
00:51:11,126 --> 00:51:14,126
He has one dance with a girl

759
00:51:14,209 --> 00:51:18,584
and he disappears for half an hour
and comes back looking smug.

760
00:51:20,251 --> 00:51:23,334
So, I asked him, straight out.

761
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:28,042
I said, "What do you say to a woman
when you've got her to yourself?"

762
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,876
And he said, "Come on and I'll show you."

763
00:51:30,959 --> 00:51:35,376
He stopped the first girl we met in the corridor
and started making love to her.

764
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:36,501
In the corridor?

765
00:51:36,584 --> 00:51:39,542
The neck of the man! Eh, fantastic!

766
00:51:39,626 --> 00:51:42,667
Even with me there!
Even so far as to tell her that…

767
00:51:43,959 --> 00:51:46,501
Still, I'll not repeat it.

768
00:51:46,584 --> 00:51:49,792
Oh, come on, Percy, tell me!

769
00:51:50,709 --> 00:51:52,084
Oh, well…

770
00:51:52,167 --> 00:51:53,459
Well…

771
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:54,626
He said…

772
00:51:55,376 --> 00:51:56,542
"What…

773
00:51:56,626 --> 00:51:57,959
What…

774
00:51:58,042 --> 00:51:59,834
What beautiful breasts you have."

775
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:02,417
And I feel a chump now for telling you.

776
00:52:02,501 --> 00:52:06,126
Ah, there's nothing in it, I realise that.

777
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:08,626
Everyone's broadminded these days.

778
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:13,001
I mean, people talk quite openly about things
my grandmother would have fainted at.

779
00:52:13,626 --> 00:52:16,251
Well, didn't your grandmother
have breasts, Percy?

780
00:52:17,209 --> 00:52:19,084
Well, y…

781
00:52:19,167 --> 00:52:21,042
Well, I know mine did.

782
00:52:21,126 --> 00:52:23,584
She had a gigantic bust

783
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:27,501
which entered the room several seconds
before she did. She was very proud of it.

784
00:52:28,334 --> 00:52:32,126
You're not old-fashioned, darling,
you're unbelievable.

785
00:52:32,209 --> 00:52:33,751
I'm all right.

786
00:52:36,001 --> 00:52:38,459
Yes, that's it.

787
00:52:38,542 --> 00:52:40,042
You'll be all right.

788
00:52:43,501 --> 00:52:46,001
And you're not missing much, you know.

789
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:51,251
Haven't you heard them say
that love is an overrated hobby?

790
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,417
Well, they're right, it is.

791
00:53:00,334 --> 00:53:02,417
Now, you go and put on your coat

792
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:06,209
and your lovely long scarf
and toddle off and catch that coach,

793
00:53:06,292 --> 00:53:08,542
and forget all about me.

794
00:53:08,626 --> 00:53:10,709
What… What are you going to do?

795
00:53:10,792 --> 00:53:13,501
I'm going to have a nice hot bath.

796
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:23,501
What did I do?

797
00:53:23,584 --> 00:53:26,501
It's no good, Percy,
I'm going back to the club.

798
00:53:26,584 --> 00:53:29,126
We don't mix, not even for a bet.

799
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:31,292
You knew? How?

800
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:36,959
That's a very small club, my pet,
and men have very big voices.

801
00:53:37,792 --> 00:53:41,167
But don't think I go around saying
come along to any old chap.

802
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:43,959
It just tickled my fancy to have
a motorcycle for a rival.

803
00:53:45,084 --> 00:53:47,459
Now don't miss that coach.

804
00:53:51,292 --> 00:53:53,126
'Ere, bloody hell, how much further?

805
00:53:53,209 --> 00:53:55,417
I thought you said it was
just round the corner.

806
00:53:55,501 --> 00:53:57,084
It is, darling.

807
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:59,917
- This corner. Come on.
- Come on.

808
00:54:08,001 --> 00:54:09,376
Here we are.

809
00:54:11,001 --> 00:54:12,584
Aw!

810
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:14,209
Oh! 'Ere!

811
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:16,626
'Ere, don't be naughty. Wait a minute.

812
00:54:16,709 --> 00:54:18,792
No, come on, give us a kiss.

813
00:54:18,876 --> 00:54:20,751
All in good time.

814
00:54:20,834 --> 00:54:23,167
- Shh!
- I've got a coach to catch.

815
00:54:23,251 --> 00:54:24,417
Shh!

816
00:54:28,667 --> 00:54:31,709
- 'Ere, don't! That's it.
- I haven't got long.

817
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:33,959
There!

818
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:37,209
Ooh! Oh, you are strong.

819
00:54:37,292 --> 00:54:38,459
Oh, I fancy you.

820
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:42,792
Let me pop upstairs and get something
more comfortable on, hmm?

821
00:54:43,501 --> 00:54:46,417
- Well, can I come with you?
- I won't be a minute!

822
00:54:48,042 --> 00:54:50,542
You are a greedy boy.

823
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,417
'Ere, steady!

824
00:55:11,251 --> 00:55:13,792
- What the hell are you doing with my wife?
- Oh!

825
00:55:13,876 --> 00:55:15,126
Joe!

826
00:55:15,209 --> 00:55:17,917
- Yeah, well… well, I had no idea…
- 'Ere, don't… don't hurt him.

827
00:55:18,001 --> 00:55:19,501
On my life, I had… No, no, no!

828
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:21,001
- I'll have ya!
- My mistake, entirely my mistake!

829
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:23,709
I… I didn't know.
I were just ready for off.

830
00:55:23,792 --> 00:55:25,292
I… Night-night.

831
00:55:30,667 --> 00:55:32,042
Phew!

832
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:34,501
Close call!

833
00:55:35,334 --> 00:55:37,501
Oh, what the hell?

834
00:55:57,126 --> 00:55:58,834
I thought you were going?

835
00:55:58,917 --> 00:56:01,042
It's all right, I am.

836
00:56:01,126 --> 00:56:03,292
I just waited to tell you,

837
00:56:03,376 --> 00:56:05,876
I'd have been proud to know you.

838
00:56:05,959 --> 00:56:07,751
Bet or no bet.

839
00:56:07,834 --> 00:56:09,042
Good.

840
00:56:16,751 --> 00:56:18,709
And there's one other thing.

841
00:56:19,792 --> 00:56:23,834
I'm not quite certain what
we decided with regard to, er…

842
00:56:24,792 --> 00:56:26,001
terms.

843
00:56:26,084 --> 00:56:27,209
Oh?

844
00:56:27,292 --> 00:56:29,834
Well, leave a shilling and piece of string
on the mantle shelf.

845
00:56:29,917 --> 00:56:31,001
Eh?

846
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:32,751
Oh…

847
00:56:34,959 --> 00:56:37,334
I wanted to, you know.

848
00:56:37,417 --> 00:56:39,542
Oh, I wanted to, Cyrenne.

849
00:56:39,626 --> 00:56:42,542
I wanted to kiss you and hold you.

850
00:56:42,626 --> 00:56:44,334
I wanted to love you!

851
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:46,792
Look! Look!

852
00:56:56,376 --> 00:56:59,667
Just me! This is just my luck!

853
00:56:59,751 --> 00:57:01,167
Never mind.

854
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,126
I don't. I'm used to it.

855
00:57:03,209 --> 00:57:05,292
The lights always go out.

856
00:57:06,667 --> 00:57:08,376
Why not make the most of it?

857
00:57:11,001 --> 00:57:15,751
Oh, if you could be warm again, Cyrenne,
you know, warm,

858
00:57:15,834 --> 00:57:18,292
like you were earlier, I think…

859
00:57:18,959 --> 00:57:20,626
I think I could.

860
00:57:23,876 --> 00:57:24,959
Yes?

861
00:57:28,209 --> 00:57:29,667
Mario.

862
00:57:33,834 --> 00:57:36,251
- Hey, what the…
- Friend of the family, Percy.

863
00:57:36,334 --> 00:57:38,084
Forgive his bad manners.

864
00:57:39,292 --> 00:57:41,209
Is this how it ends then?

865
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:44,917
I'm afraid so.

866
00:57:46,542 --> 00:57:49,209
- Good luck with Ginger.
- Go on, hop it!

867
00:57:53,876 --> 00:57:57,084
Thanks for the cup of tea and everything.

868
00:58:01,001 --> 00:58:02,084
Percy.

869
00:58:06,376 --> 00:58:08,126
Souvenir for Cyrenne?

870
00:58:09,334 --> 00:58:10,709
If you like.

871
00:58:14,459 --> 00:58:16,417
What friends you have!

872
00:58:16,501 --> 00:58:18,834
- Why do you care?
- I care a lot.

873
00:58:18,917 --> 00:58:22,251
Listen, I'm not interested
in getting insulted by you!

874
00:58:31,792 --> 00:58:34,501
Oh, come on, come on.

875
00:58:35,126 --> 00:58:37,751
Oh, lovely, eh?

876
00:58:37,834 --> 00:58:39,084
Eh?

877
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:42,001
Let's go!

878
00:58:44,042 --> 00:58:45,501
Get in!

879
00:58:49,876 --> 00:58:51,751
Hey, you bastard!

880
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:05,334
Oh, well.

881
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:06,709
That's that.

882
00:59:09,667 --> 00:59:11,042
Shall we dance?

883
00:59:15,917 --> 00:59:18,084
Coming for a walk, eh?

884
00:59:18,917 --> 00:59:20,126
Ah!

885
00:59:21,376 --> 00:59:22,542
Come on.

886
00:59:31,709 --> 00:59:32,792
Eh, Fred.

887
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:41,709
Hello, you've been quick.

888
00:59:41,792 --> 00:59:44,001
Eh, it doesn't take long when
you know what you're doing.

889
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:46,334
- You mean you…
- Of course.

890
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:50,126
- I reckon this calls for a celebration.
- It does that! I'm buying.

891
00:59:50,209 --> 00:59:53,042
- Four Scotches, please, love.
- My word, that's what I like, in't it?

892
00:59:53,126 --> 00:59:54,209
What?

893
00:59:55,917 --> 00:59:57,959
- That good time bitch!
- What's the matter?

894
00:59:58,042 --> 01:00:00,917
- I've been rode, that's what's the matter.
- Rode?

895
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:03,501
Not here you haven't.
We run a straight house.

896
01:00:03,584 --> 01:00:07,126
I know, love. I know who did it
and I know where and when.

897
01:00:07,209 --> 01:00:08,834
- Well, I…
- Hold that.

898
01:00:08,917 --> 01:00:11,251
Think I'm up from
the bloody country, do they?

899
01:00:11,334 --> 01:00:14,001
- Bloody green. I'll be right back.
- Well, do you want us to come and help?

900
01:00:14,084 --> 01:00:16,917
No, this is something I've got to do myself.
Oh, pay for the drinks.

901
01:00:36,584 --> 01:00:38,126
No, not in there, please!

902
01:00:38,209 --> 01:00:40,251
Come on, come!

903
01:00:42,876 --> 01:00:44,084
- Come on!
- No, please!

904
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:45,251
Come on!

905
01:00:54,126 --> 01:00:56,334
Hello, Mama.

906
01:00:59,042 --> 01:01:00,459
Hello, Papa.

907
01:01:00,542 --> 01:01:01,834
Cyrenne!

908
01:01:06,501 --> 01:01:07,626
Hello, Mama!

909
01:01:07,709 --> 01:01:10,209
Oh, the Contessa comes calling.
Great honour.

910
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:11,501
Oh, Mama.

911
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:13,251
Why has she come back here?

912
01:01:13,334 --> 01:01:15,209
You slumming or something?

913
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:17,751
I brought her here,
so we can sort things out.

914
01:01:17,834 --> 01:01:19,209
Two Bolognese.

915
01:01:19,292 --> 01:01:20,167
Number four.

916
01:01:20,251 --> 01:01:22,209
Sort out Lady Muck? Yeah, big deal!

917
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:25,501
Oh well, now I know why I'm here!

918
01:01:25,584 --> 01:01:29,167
To drag me back through the mud.
Funny coming from you, Ricky!

919
01:01:29,251 --> 01:01:33,667
And you? Spying, acting like a guardian.

920
01:01:33,751 --> 01:01:35,584
What kind of brother
do you think you are?

921
01:01:35,667 --> 01:01:36,709
Enough, shut up!

922
01:01:36,792 --> 01:01:40,251
- You shut up!
- Please, don't get on my nerves!

923
01:01:40,334 --> 01:01:43,376
Son, don't waste your breath on her!
She's useless.

924
01:01:43,459 --> 01:01:45,542
A disgrace, and she deserves all she gets.

925
01:01:45,626 --> 01:01:48,709
Enough, Mama!
Why don't you ever leave her alone?

926
01:01:48,792 --> 01:01:51,167
I'm not surprised Cyrenne is fed up with us!

927
01:01:51,251 --> 01:01:53,626
As usual, you jump to her defence!

928
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:55,417
No, I'm not defending her!

929
01:01:55,501 --> 01:01:57,542
No! She should never
step foot back into our house!

930
01:01:57,626 --> 01:01:59,501
Our home has always been
an honest and decent one.

931
01:01:59,584 --> 01:02:02,626
Mama is right, you say sorry to her.

932
01:02:02,709 --> 01:02:08,376
That's rich! You take me, say and do
whatever you want and I have to say sorry?

933
01:02:08,459 --> 01:02:11,084
- Yes.
- No! Go to hell, all of you!

934
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:12,876
All right, all right. That's enough.

935
01:02:12,959 --> 01:02:14,834
Two Bolognese, table four, ready!

936
01:02:14,917 --> 01:02:18,709
But I didn't call the order!
It was Dario! Why do I have to do it?

937
01:02:18,792 --> 01:02:21,959
- Good Lord, just take them!
- Where the hell has he gone? Dario!

938
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:23,626
Do like Mama says!

939
01:02:25,626 --> 01:02:26,751
Cyrenne.

940
01:02:27,792 --> 01:02:30,126
We're opening a new place, real snooty.

941
01:02:30,209 --> 01:02:31,876
Drinks, pianist, the lot.

942
01:02:32,917 --> 01:02:34,917
Me and Uncle Arty are putting up the money.

943
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,876
Bully for you.

944
01:02:36,959 --> 01:02:38,834
We want you on the cash desk.

945
01:02:38,917 --> 01:02:40,459
- Keep it in the family.
- No go, Ricky.

946
01:02:40,542 --> 01:02:42,626
I've given up slaving in caves.

947
01:02:42,709 --> 01:02:45,334
You waste your time. Let her go.

948
01:02:45,417 --> 01:02:47,876
Be still, Mama, I'm trying to keep
my sister off the streets.

949
01:02:51,542 --> 01:02:53,084
Yes, we know, sis.

950
01:02:54,459 --> 01:02:55,751
We all know.

951
01:02:56,459 --> 01:02:58,667
You didn't think it was a secret?

952
01:02:58,751 --> 01:03:00,334
Why you do this?

953
01:03:00,417 --> 01:03:02,834
Holy Mother, why you do it, huh?

954
01:03:02,917 --> 01:03:04,876
I hadn't been home two days.

955
01:03:05,501 --> 01:03:08,001
Two days off the ship
and I meet old Toskie.

956
01:03:08,667 --> 01:03:11,751
"I've seen your sister picking up men
in a drinking club," he said.

957
01:03:12,792 --> 01:03:15,542
So, er, me and Mario, we watched.

958
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:16,876
Yes.

959
01:03:17,667 --> 01:03:19,542
We've been watching you
for the last three nights.

960
01:03:20,292 --> 01:03:22,626
Well, there's a nice brotherly gesture.

961
01:03:22,709 --> 01:03:26,001
Where you learn this?
To give yourself to men?

962
01:03:26,084 --> 01:03:28,376
To bring shame on our name,
on our house?

963
01:03:28,459 --> 01:03:31,501
- Where you learn it, huh?
- You know, Mama!

964
01:03:31,584 --> 01:03:33,292
You know where I learnt it.

965
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:35,084
Why should Mama know?

966
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:37,001
Everyone worried.

967
01:03:37,084 --> 01:03:40,792
Everybody weeping about the family,
about Mama, Ricky, Mario.

968
01:03:40,876 --> 01:03:42,834
No one weeping about me. Marvellous!

969
01:03:42,917 --> 01:03:45,417
My own sister a prostitute.

970
01:03:46,001 --> 01:03:49,334
- A filthy, dirty—
- Don't call me filthy!

971
01:03:49,417 --> 01:03:51,167
You don't know.

972
01:03:51,251 --> 01:03:53,167
You don't know, Ricky.

973
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:57,167
You played with your friends in the sun,
but I was the girl.

974
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,334
I had to slave in this scum-ridden kitchen

975
01:04:00,417 --> 01:04:02,292
and my friends were these!

976
01:04:05,167 --> 01:04:08,001
Once I dropped my cloth
behind that stove over there

977
01:04:08,084 --> 01:04:11,334
and when I brought my arm out
it was covered with those crawling…

978
01:04:15,709 --> 01:04:17,751
Why do you hate me, Mama?

979
01:04:18,417 --> 01:04:19,876
No, don't turn away.

980
01:04:20,626 --> 01:04:22,709
Why? Tell me, why do you hate me?

981
01:04:25,542 --> 01:04:27,042
Is it because of him?

982
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:29,042
Is it?

983
01:04:29,126 --> 01:04:32,376
Is it because he pawed me
and squeezed past me?

984
01:04:32,459 --> 01:04:35,376
Is it because of the day he…
he pushed me into the bedroom?

985
01:04:44,584 --> 01:04:46,501
I never told anyone, Papa.

986
01:04:47,459 --> 01:04:49,251
Not anyone, not till today.

987
01:04:51,751 --> 01:04:53,709
But Mama knew anyway.

988
01:04:57,042 --> 01:04:58,751
She's lying. Tell me she's lying.

989
01:05:00,501 --> 01:05:01,751
It's an excuse.

990
01:05:03,501 --> 01:05:06,001
Nobody's perfect, Ricky.

991
01:05:06,709 --> 01:05:09,167
We are none of us <i>perfetto.</i>

992
01:05:10,001 --> 01:05:11,542
Not even yourself.

993
01:05:22,626 --> 01:05:23,626
Mama.

994
01:05:26,042 --> 01:05:28,167
Finish the greens for tomorrow.

995
01:05:32,459 --> 01:05:33,917
I'm sorry, sis.

996
01:05:35,292 --> 01:05:37,042
I never knew anything about it.

997
01:05:37,126 --> 01:05:38,376
Ah, forget it.

998
01:05:38,459 --> 01:05:39,792
Got a light?

999
01:05:42,376 --> 01:05:44,876
You know I wanted
to marry you once, Ricky?

1000
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:48,292
When I was seven I used to tell people,
"I'm going to marry Ricky when I grow up."

1001
01:05:53,834 --> 01:05:55,417
How are the kids, Ricky?

1002
01:05:56,334 --> 01:05:57,834
Oh, they're fine.

1003
01:05:57,917 --> 01:06:01,292
Ricky Junior goes to school now
and Sophia, you should see her.

1004
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:04,209
She's going to be a heartbreaker
when she grows up.

1005
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:05,292
Yeah?

1006
01:06:05,376 --> 01:06:09,042
Ooh, I've got some stamps for them,
foreign stamps, I've been saving them up.

1007
01:06:09,126 --> 01:06:12,001
Hey, Ricky, why don't we go over
and take them to them now?

1008
01:06:12,084 --> 01:06:13,459
Oh, it's too late now, sis.

1009
01:06:13,542 --> 01:06:15,876
Margot always have them in bed early.
She's very strict.

1010
01:06:15,959 --> 01:06:17,626
Tomorrow then, huh?

1011
01:06:17,709 --> 01:06:21,334
- Tomorrow? Well, tomorrow's a bit tricky too.
- Where are they?

1012
01:06:21,417 --> 01:06:22,751
Well then, let's make it Thursday.

1013
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:25,292
Well…

1014
01:06:26,751 --> 01:06:28,417
Look, sis,

1015
01:06:28,501 --> 01:06:29,626
Margot knows.

1016
01:06:31,042 --> 01:06:32,709
Like I said, she's very strict.

1017
01:06:33,542 --> 01:06:35,167
She might not like the kids to…

1018
01:06:49,667 --> 01:06:50,876
Cyrenne!

1019
01:06:54,251 --> 01:06:56,334
Cyrenne! Cyrenne, wait!
I'll drive you home!

1020
01:07:37,126 --> 01:07:39,917
Oh, I'm dreaming.

1021
01:07:40,001 --> 01:07:43,584
I must be bloody dreaming.

1022
01:07:43,667 --> 01:07:46,751
- Quiet. We'll soon take care of you.
- Oh!

1023
01:07:57,959 --> 01:07:59,209
- Hey.
- Huh?

1024
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:00,334
Hey.

1025
01:08:00,417 --> 01:08:01,417
Oh.

1026
01:08:02,542 --> 01:08:04,501
I thought you'd gone back to Scunthorpe.

1027
01:08:04,584 --> 01:08:07,376
It's Manchester, as you know very well.

1028
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:08,917
Oh, is it?

1029
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:10,376
Eh, is it all right?

1030
01:08:10,459 --> 01:08:13,667
- I mean, that chap.
- Oh, that was my brother Mario.

1031
01:08:13,751 --> 01:08:15,751
The one that runs the country club?

1032
01:08:17,001 --> 01:08:18,792
It's not a country club.

1033
01:08:18,876 --> 01:08:20,709
It's a caff.

1034
01:08:20,792 --> 01:08:23,001
Well, it's the same thing, in't it really?

1035
01:08:23,084 --> 01:08:25,501
Except country club sounds posher.

1036
01:08:25,584 --> 01:08:27,042
We all put on airs.

1037
01:08:27,751 --> 01:08:30,459
- No, not you, Percy, you don't.
- Oh, everyone does.

1038
01:08:30,542 --> 01:08:31,626
'Ere.

1039
01:08:32,334 --> 01:08:33,542
Oh, ta.

1040
01:08:35,626 --> 01:08:36,959
Well…

1041
01:08:37,042 --> 01:08:39,501
what have you been doing with yourself?

1042
01:08:39,584 --> 01:08:41,292
I've been round the block.

1043
01:08:43,501 --> 01:08:45,001
Seven times.

1044
01:08:45,084 --> 01:08:47,084
Eh, a policeman followed me last time.

1045
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,042
- What did you do that for?
- I were thinking.

1046
01:08:53,459 --> 01:08:56,709
Do you ever talk to yourself? I do.

1047
01:08:56,792 --> 01:09:01,042
At home, I go for long walks
round the town and I talk to myself.

1048
01:09:01,126 --> 01:09:05,917
You know, sometimes if I haven't finished
the conversation by the time I get back home,

1049
01:09:06,001 --> 01:09:07,917
I… I go round again.

1050
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:12,501
Couldn't you find the lads?

1051
01:09:12,584 --> 01:09:14,001
I didn't try.

1052
01:09:14,084 --> 01:09:18,917
I've been telling myself about you,
round and round that block.

1053
01:09:19,001 --> 01:09:22,626
No wonder that copper followed me.
He must have thought I were off me bonce.

1054
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:24,834
Look, Cyrenne.

1055
01:09:25,626 --> 01:09:29,001
You went cold on me, didn't you?
You lost interest.

1056
01:09:29,084 --> 01:09:31,709
Look, what I mean is, if it's your…

1057
01:09:33,251 --> 01:09:35,542
Look, you go with men, don't you?

1058
01:09:35,626 --> 01:09:38,126
Surely, I'm not so dull that even you could…

1059
01:09:38,917 --> 01:09:41,917
Can't you see what tonight's
been like for me?

1060
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:43,751
Oh…

1061
01:09:43,834 --> 01:09:47,084
I'm walking through Manchester,

1062
01:09:47,167 --> 01:09:49,376
market square, say, at 3:00am,

1063
01:09:49,459 --> 01:09:54,209
and suddenly, there's a gigantic building
where the chip shop was.

1064
01:09:54,292 --> 01:09:58,042
It shouldn't be there, I know that, but it is.

1065
01:09:58,126 --> 01:09:59,959
I open the door,

1066
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:02,876
and it's full of a million people I've never met

1067
01:10:02,959 --> 01:10:05,959
and they're all laughing
and shouting and singing,

1068
01:10:06,042 --> 01:10:09,542
and there's lights ablaze
and there's the music blaring.

1069
01:10:10,167 --> 01:10:13,376
And then… an exciting woman,

1070
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:16,417
oh, a sweet, wonderful,

1071
01:10:16,501 --> 01:10:20,084
exciting woman grabs me by the hand.

1072
01:10:20,167 --> 01:10:23,459
She hurtles me right into the middle of it all!

1073
01:10:23,542 --> 01:10:25,584
- At 3:00am in the morning!
- Whee!

1074
01:10:25,667 --> 01:10:28,542
And you thought of nothing then
but the eight o'clock buzzer.

1075
01:10:29,917 --> 01:10:31,459
Do you think I'm daft?

1076
01:10:34,501 --> 01:10:36,126
I think you're wet.

1077
01:10:39,834 --> 01:10:41,709
Ah! Are you hungry?

1078
01:10:41,792 --> 01:10:43,876
Why, have you found some more biscuits?

1079
01:10:43,959 --> 01:10:47,084
No, but Willie will give us
a bite to eat if I ask him to.

1080
01:10:47,167 --> 01:10:49,084
- By heck, I'd like that.
- Come on then.

1081
01:10:52,084 --> 01:10:54,001
These stairs!

1082
01:11:09,584 --> 01:11:10,709
Hey!

1083
01:11:10,792 --> 01:11:11,709
Shh!

1084
01:11:25,626 --> 01:11:26,751
Willie!

1085
01:11:27,792 --> 01:11:28,917
Willie!

1086
01:11:29,542 --> 01:11:30,917
Hey, Willie.

1087
01:11:31,001 --> 01:11:33,542
It isn't Willie. It's Mike.

1088
01:11:33,626 --> 01:11:36,209
Oh, sorry. Where's the food?

1089
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:39,042
Where the hell do you think?
On the table.

1090
01:11:39,126 --> 01:11:40,209
Oh, ta.

1091
01:11:46,709 --> 01:11:48,001
Shh!

1092
01:11:49,292 --> 01:11:51,251
Here. Help yourself.

1093
01:11:51,334 --> 01:11:54,001
- Will it be all right?
- Well, we're invited.

1094
01:11:54,709 --> 01:11:56,376
- There we are.
- Thanks.

1095
01:11:56,459 --> 01:11:58,876
- Now, can you get up?
- Aye.

1096
01:12:04,667 --> 01:12:06,626
Oh, here, love.

1097
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:11,334
Put that in the Red Cross box.

1098
01:12:11,417 --> 01:12:13,542
Oh, how very generous.

1099
01:12:13,626 --> 01:12:17,167
And if you want some more practice
there's a lad in number 11 unconscious.

1100
01:12:17,251 --> 01:12:18,876
He fell down the stairs.

1101
01:12:18,959 --> 01:12:20,334
Oh, splendid.

1102
01:12:29,751 --> 01:12:32,459
- What college did you go to?
- Mm?

1103
01:12:32,542 --> 01:12:34,709
You say you went to Oxford.
What college?

1104
01:12:34,792 --> 01:12:36,709
One for women, naturally.

1105
01:12:36,792 --> 01:12:38,584
You must have been marvellous.

1106
01:12:38,667 --> 01:12:41,459
I'd have given my eye teeth
to have gone on to college.

1107
01:12:41,542 --> 01:12:43,376
Oh, it was.

1108
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:46,167
It was all singing and dancing,

1109
01:12:46,251 --> 01:12:48,834
and… and parties by the river.

1110
01:12:49,542 --> 01:12:53,292
Sometimes a whole bunch of us
would take a punt out and float,

1111
01:12:53,376 --> 01:12:54,959
just float.

1112
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:58,209
With bottles of wine and meat pies.

1113
01:12:58,292 --> 01:12:59,584
David…

1114
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:01,959
He's an earl's son.

1115
01:13:02,709 --> 01:13:04,542
He once got the pole stuck

1116
01:13:04,626 --> 01:13:07,626
and we left him in the middle of the river
like a monkey up a stick.

1117
01:13:07,709 --> 01:13:09,917
Eh, son of an earl, eh?

1118
01:13:10,001 --> 01:13:12,334
Mmm. Poor David.

1119
01:13:13,251 --> 01:13:15,417
He asked me to marry him, you know.

1120
01:13:15,501 --> 01:13:18,459
But I said he was too young.
He sulked for weeks.

1121
01:13:19,126 --> 01:13:21,251
Anyway, he wasn't supposed to go with girls.

1122
01:13:21,334 --> 01:13:24,167
It ruined his baseball or something.

1123
01:13:24,251 --> 01:13:25,834
Ah!

1124
01:13:25,917 --> 01:13:28,042
Baseball, you say, at Oxford?

1125
01:13:28,126 --> 01:13:31,417
They have baseball for Americans at Oxford.
He was American.

1126
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:34,917
- The son of an earl?
- Mmm.

1127
01:13:36,459 --> 01:13:38,876
That was David. I was talking about Phillip.

1128
01:13:40,376 --> 01:13:43,251
I must have lost track somewhere.

1129
01:13:44,417 --> 01:13:48,834
If you were always singing and dancing,
how did you get an M.A.?

1130
01:13:48,917 --> 01:13:51,542
- Well, my father bought it.
- You're father bought an M.A.?

1131
01:13:51,626 --> 01:13:54,751
Mmm. You can do anything with money.

1132
01:13:54,834 --> 01:13:56,834
My father was never short.

1133
01:13:57,626 --> 01:13:59,876
Every time he used to come to see me

1134
01:13:59,959 --> 01:14:01,917
he'd push a fiver into my hand.

1135
01:14:03,376 --> 01:14:05,376
"Have fun, sweetie," he'd say.

1136
01:14:05,459 --> 01:14:08,334
He sounds a grand chap.

1137
01:14:08,417 --> 01:14:10,542
Pity he died so early.

1138
01:14:10,626 --> 01:14:12,626
I mean, he might have helped…

1139
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:14,292
Now, look.

1140
01:14:14,376 --> 01:14:16,459
Seeing as he's not around…

1141
01:14:16,542 --> 01:14:20,251
Now, don't get insulted but…

1142
01:14:21,792 --> 01:14:23,584
Have fun, sweetie.

1143
01:14:26,126 --> 01:14:27,917
- What's this for?
- Nothing.

1144
01:14:28,001 --> 01:14:29,459
Go on!

1145
01:14:29,542 --> 01:14:31,542
Have fun, sweetie.

1146
01:14:37,042 --> 01:14:39,917
I'm afraid you've crept up
behind me, Percival.

1147
01:14:41,084 --> 01:14:44,709
Eh, heck, I can't have spent all that.

1148
01:14:45,709 --> 01:14:48,167
Crickey, I must have had some wallop.

1149
01:14:50,417 --> 01:14:51,959
Well…

1150
01:14:52,042 --> 01:14:53,834
- that's the way it goes.
- Thank you.

1151
01:14:53,917 --> 01:14:55,084
No!

1152
01:14:55,167 --> 01:14:57,001
That's for you.

1153
01:15:00,376 --> 01:15:02,084
There's still time.

1154
01:15:12,959 --> 01:15:15,417
Well… shall we do the dishes?

1155
01:15:16,834 --> 01:15:19,459
Dishes, on a Saturday night?

1156
01:15:20,126 --> 01:15:23,126
My dirty-minded friends
would never speak to me again.

1157
01:15:28,751 --> 01:15:31,001
Time, please, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's have your glasses, please.

1158
01:15:31,084 --> 01:15:32,792
- Come along, please.
- Drink up, love.

1159
01:15:35,542 --> 01:15:36,751
Hey!

1160
01:15:38,584 --> 01:15:40,626
All right, all right.

1161
01:15:40,709 --> 01:15:42,042
Joke over.

1162
01:15:42,126 --> 01:15:43,667
Hey!

1163
01:15:43,751 --> 01:15:45,376
Whose husband did that?

1164
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:47,751
Oh, well, for once in your life,
you're right.

1165
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:52,292
- Now, be a gentleman and buy me a pint.
- Impossible on both counts.

1166
01:15:52,376 --> 01:15:54,834
Let's have you, come on now.
Haven't you got no homes?

1167
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:57,626
Oh, to say that we're
not gentlemen is insulting.

1168
01:15:57,709 --> 01:16:00,084
To say there's no more beer is obscene.

1169
01:16:00,167 --> 01:16:02,376
Bloody hell. Come on,
let's go find Chalky and go.

1170
01:16:02,459 --> 01:16:03,751
- Right.
- Chalky?

1171
01:16:03,834 --> 01:16:06,542
- Chalky?
- Eh, there's something soft under my feet.

1172
01:16:13,709 --> 01:16:18,001
You may think me strange
but I enjoy washing up.

1173
01:16:18,084 --> 01:16:20,209
I mean, I get a real kick out of it.

1174
01:16:20,292 --> 01:16:24,334
You see, most folk can't bear the sight
of dirty dishes, but not me.

1175
01:16:24,417 --> 01:16:29,292
I love it. Oh, it must be marvellous
having a cosy little kitchen all of your own.

1176
01:16:31,459 --> 01:16:33,709
Have you got a dog or a cat?

1177
01:16:33,792 --> 01:16:35,709
No. Why?

1178
01:16:37,501 --> 01:16:38,917
Something to love.

1179
01:16:41,209 --> 01:16:43,834
You know, Bill Hedges up at the mill,

1180
01:16:43,917 --> 01:16:46,501
he has a daughter aged 16.

1181
01:16:46,584 --> 01:16:48,501
And he's only 34.

1182
01:16:49,667 --> 01:16:53,584
It must be marvellous
having someone like that.

1183
01:16:54,292 --> 01:16:57,876
While you're still young.
You know, fluffy and high heels.

1184
01:16:57,959 --> 01:17:00,251
Someone you've made yourself.

1185
01:17:01,334 --> 01:17:03,334
It must be marvellous.

1186
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:06,001
Having her love you and call you Dad.

1187
01:17:07,876 --> 01:17:10,584
I often imagine myself with a daughter.

1188
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:12,042
But never a wife.

1189
01:17:12,792 --> 01:17:14,792
It's funny,

1190
01:17:14,876 --> 01:17:17,167
I see myself as a widower.

1191
01:17:17,251 --> 01:17:19,042
The wife died young.

1192
01:17:19,876 --> 01:17:21,917
I never bother how, she's just dead.

1193
01:17:24,542 --> 01:17:25,959
Percy…

1194
01:17:26,042 --> 01:17:28,501
when did you go on your last holiday?

1195
01:17:28,584 --> 01:17:30,792
Last August. I went to Morecambe.

1196
01:17:32,584 --> 01:17:34,334
Did you enjoy yourself?

1197
01:17:34,417 --> 01:17:35,626
Oh, aye.

1198
01:17:35,709 --> 01:17:38,209
Went swimming and horse riding.

1199
01:17:38,292 --> 01:17:39,542
Went hiking.

1200
01:17:39,626 --> 01:17:40,876
By yourself?

1201
01:17:40,959 --> 01:17:42,376
Beg your pardon?

1202
01:17:42,459 --> 01:17:43,667
By yourself?

1203
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:45,834
No.

1204
01:17:46,667 --> 01:17:50,084
Well, I palled up with
a married couple at the hotel.

1205
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:53,667
They took quite a fancy to me, cos
I were always making them laugh.

1206
01:17:53,751 --> 01:17:56,167
Oh, it's a marvellous place, Morecambe.

1207
01:17:57,084 --> 01:18:00,959
Think I'll, er, go somewhere else
next year though.

1208
01:18:02,376 --> 01:18:03,292
Well…

1209
01:18:04,209 --> 01:18:05,542
that's the lot.

1210
01:18:12,334 --> 01:18:14,542
£50 is a lot of money.

1211
01:18:14,626 --> 01:18:15,834
Aye.

1212
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:18,542
It's a nice motorbike too.

1213
01:18:19,376 --> 01:18:22,667
500cc, twin exhausts.

1214
01:18:25,251 --> 01:18:28,626
A fella could have a really
crazy holiday with £50.

1215
01:18:29,334 --> 01:18:31,084
I only spent 30 on Morecambe.

1216
01:18:33,001 --> 01:18:34,459
I meant a holiday for two.

1217
01:18:34,542 --> 01:18:36,126
Oh, aye, you could that.

1218
01:18:37,167 --> 01:18:39,876
Would you like to come
on holiday with me, Percy?

1219
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:42,959
Oh, aye, when do we start, now?

1220
01:18:43,042 --> 01:18:44,584
Now or in the morning.

1221
01:18:45,376 --> 01:18:47,459
You… You're not…
You're not serious?

1222
01:18:48,542 --> 01:18:49,917
Very serious.

1223
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:53,042
Well, the mill won't close without you.

1224
01:18:53,126 --> 01:18:54,501
No, but…

1225
01:18:55,209 --> 01:18:56,251
Afraid?

1226
01:18:56,834 --> 01:18:57,959
Me?

1227
01:18:58,042 --> 01:18:59,376
Why, should I be?

1228
01:19:00,292 --> 01:19:02,084
Of what Mummy would say.

1229
01:19:02,917 --> 01:19:05,667
The boss or the lady next door.

1230
01:19:07,126 --> 01:19:09,459
Do you mean, for us to go together?

1231
01:19:09,542 --> 01:19:11,917
Sort of… together?

1232
01:19:12,876 --> 01:19:15,417
You'd be my Sunday boy, Percy.

1233
01:19:18,334 --> 01:19:21,459
You'd have everything I've saved
from the rest of the world.

1234
01:19:21,542 --> 01:19:23,751
Just a week, no strings on my side.

1235
01:19:23,834 --> 01:19:25,209
Just a week.

1236
01:19:26,334 --> 01:19:29,084
And then I'll wave you goodbye
at the coach station and…

1237
01:19:30,292 --> 01:19:33,292
we'd both have something,
well, something nice for…

1238
01:19:33,376 --> 01:19:35,542
For when the eight o'clock buzzer goes.

1239
01:19:36,334 --> 01:19:37,751
Shall we?

1240
01:19:37,834 --> 01:19:40,126
What about money? I'm not rich.

1241
01:19:42,376 --> 01:19:44,126
Ginger's paying.

1242
01:19:44,792 --> 01:19:46,084
Ooh, he…

1243
01:19:46,626 --> 01:19:49,001
What wouldn't I give.

1244
01:19:50,042 --> 01:19:53,709
That plum in Ginger's mouth
would shrivel to a currant.

1245
01:19:53,792 --> 01:19:57,501
It's a cheeky idea. It's dead cheeky.

1246
01:19:58,667 --> 01:20:00,626
I've had me two weeks this year.

1247
01:20:02,167 --> 01:20:04,626
Well, they weren't exactly a success,
were they?

1248
01:20:05,251 --> 01:20:06,667
Who said so?

1249
01:20:07,751 --> 01:20:09,084
You did.

1250
01:20:10,792 --> 01:20:12,292
Between the lines.

1251
01:20:15,834 --> 01:20:17,667
Must be pretty obvious.

1252
01:20:18,792 --> 01:20:20,167
It wasn't much good.

1253
01:20:21,376 --> 01:20:22,417
It never is.

1254
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,292
I don't enjoy Christmas either.

1255
01:20:26,084 --> 01:20:27,459
Well?

1256
01:20:32,334 --> 01:20:35,209
You know, I'm trembling inside.

1257
01:20:36,542 --> 01:20:39,751
I don't have much confidence.
Do you follow?

1258
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:42,292
I've left it a bit late.

1259
01:20:42,376 --> 01:20:44,542
I'm not 33.

1260
01:20:45,292 --> 01:20:49,376
I'm 39 and I don't think I could
come up to your expectations.

1261
01:20:49,459 --> 01:20:51,001
I know I can't!

1262
01:20:51,084 --> 01:20:54,376
And I'm not going on holiday
to be ridiculed the first time we —

1263
01:20:54,459 --> 01:20:56,584
if you'll excuse me —
we go into the bedroom.

1264
01:20:56,667 --> 01:20:58,459
I'm being blunt, but there it is.

1265
01:21:01,417 --> 01:21:03,542
You've arrived too late.

1266
01:21:06,376 --> 01:21:08,792
Take a chance, Percy, why not?

1267
01:21:09,834 --> 01:21:11,376
Because…

1268
01:21:11,459 --> 01:21:14,459
I'm afraid I'm not a man!

1269
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:16,876
I'm afraid I'm effeminate or something.

1270
01:21:18,167 --> 01:21:21,334
You see, all the fellas I grew up with,

1271
01:21:21,417 --> 01:21:23,376
I went to school with,

1272
01:21:23,459 --> 01:21:25,084
they're all married.

1273
01:21:25,167 --> 01:21:28,667
They're all settled down.
They've all got children, except me.

1274
01:21:30,001 --> 01:21:34,376
And I'm scared of finding out
there's something different about me.

1275
01:21:35,626 --> 01:21:37,667
I'm afraid.

1276
01:21:38,959 --> 01:21:40,209
I'm just…

1277
01:21:41,209 --> 01:21:42,459
afraid.

1278
01:21:46,876 --> 01:21:48,709
I wanted to go on holiday.

1279
01:21:49,751 --> 01:21:52,417
I would have liked to have gone to Switzerland
but anywhere would have done.

1280
01:21:52,501 --> 01:21:56,084
Blackpool, Morecambe, Ashby-de-la-Zouch.

1281
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:04,042
All right.

1282
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:05,876
Where?

1283
01:22:08,334 --> 01:22:11,001
I know! Brighton.

1284
01:22:11,084 --> 01:22:13,876
There's a train at midnight.
We can be there by one o'clock.

1285
01:22:13,959 --> 01:22:15,417
Oh, suitcases.

1286
01:22:15,501 --> 01:22:16,876
Suitcases.

1287
01:22:16,959 --> 01:22:19,042
I've left my suitcases with Willie.

1288
01:22:19,126 --> 01:22:20,501
Come here a minute.

1289
01:22:30,292 --> 01:22:32,376
Now go and fetch that suitcase.

1290
01:22:45,209 --> 01:22:46,501
Very good.

1291
01:22:47,417 --> 01:22:48,876
Very good indeed.

1292
01:22:50,167 --> 01:22:51,209
Ooh!

1293
01:23:03,792 --> 01:23:05,834
- Where's Willie?
- Bridal suite.

1294
01:23:05,917 --> 01:23:07,251
Oh. Thank you.

1295
01:23:12,001 --> 01:23:13,792
Willie!

1296
01:23:13,876 --> 01:23:15,417
Who is it?

1297
01:23:15,501 --> 01:23:19,417
Willie, I'm sorry, darling,
it's my suitcase, I need it.

1298
01:23:19,501 --> 01:23:21,584
- Suitcase?
- Mm-hm, where is it?

1299
01:23:21,667 --> 01:23:23,334
I don't know, somewhere around.

1300
01:23:24,209 --> 01:23:26,501
Oh, no, I lent it to Sally, I think.

1301
01:23:26,584 --> 01:23:28,209
Wow, what a nerve!

1302
01:23:28,292 --> 01:23:30,417
- Where are you going?
- On my honeymoon.

1303
01:23:35,001 --> 01:23:37,751
Oh, come on, Chalky, will you?

1304
01:23:37,834 --> 01:23:39,292
- I want to take it home!
- Bloody hell!

1305
01:23:39,376 --> 01:23:41,959
- It's not worth dying for! Coaches!
- You'll get run over!

1306
01:23:42,042 --> 01:23:45,292
I feel like doing something really mad!

1307
01:23:47,001 --> 01:23:50,501
Hey! Hey! Hey! Eh!

1308
01:23:58,417 --> 01:24:01,376
Don't be such a damn fool!

1309
01:24:01,459 --> 01:24:03,126
What's the matter with you?

1310
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:11,292
Oh, if only my mother could see me now.

1311
01:24:17,167 --> 01:24:18,876
Take it easy.

1312
01:24:18,959 --> 01:24:20,917
You're going to be all right, lad.

1313
01:24:21,917 --> 01:24:23,626
You're going to do all right.

1314
01:24:34,376 --> 01:24:35,251
Hello.

1315
01:24:35,334 --> 01:24:38,542
I'm-a wish-a speak Cyrenne, yes?

1316
01:24:38,626 --> 01:24:40,917
Who? I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

1317
01:24:41,001 --> 01:24:44,876
Please, I wanna speak Cyrenne.

1318
01:24:47,376 --> 01:24:49,209
Please, you ask her, huh?

1319
01:24:49,292 --> 01:24:51,917
Cause no trouble. I am the father.

1320
01:24:52,001 --> 01:24:54,626
Father? Whose father?

1321
01:24:54,709 --> 01:24:57,167
What for you make things worse, huh?

1322
01:24:57,251 --> 01:25:00,126
I got to try, Mama. It's no harm.

1323
01:25:00,209 --> 01:25:02,167
Hello? Listen.

1324
01:25:02,251 --> 01:25:05,167
It's a-very bad.
I understand what you do.

1325
01:25:05,251 --> 01:25:07,376
Cause no trouble. Ring later.

1326
01:25:08,209 --> 01:25:09,542
I am the father.

1327
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:27,459
Your father just phoned.

1328
01:25:28,917 --> 01:25:30,501
He says he'll call again.

1329
01:25:32,167 --> 01:25:35,084
Seems he's come back
from the dead, doesn't it?

1330
01:25:36,084 --> 01:25:38,042
My… my step-father?

1331
01:25:38,126 --> 01:25:39,376
Oh?

1332
01:25:39,459 --> 01:25:41,459
When did your mother remarry?

1333
01:25:43,292 --> 01:25:45,417
A few years ago.

1334
01:25:45,501 --> 01:25:48,626
You said she died when you were 12.

1335
01:25:56,542 --> 01:25:58,626
Now it makes sense!

1336
01:26:00,626 --> 01:26:03,959
Since when has there been
an Italian general in the British Army?

1337
01:26:04,042 --> 01:26:05,876
Who says it was the British Army?

1338
01:26:05,959 --> 01:26:08,834
Oh, come off it, will you?

1339
01:26:08,917 --> 01:26:10,876
Your dad's sporting a foreign accent.

1340
01:26:10,959 --> 01:26:14,042
Said he was phoning from the café
or the country club,

1341
01:26:14,126 --> 01:26:16,917
or whatever you call it. The one
he runs with your brother, right!

1342
01:26:17,001 --> 01:26:18,792
Well done, full marks.

1343
01:26:18,876 --> 01:26:21,917
A rent book for an house you own.

1344
01:26:22,001 --> 01:26:24,542
An M.A. your father bought!

1345
01:26:25,709 --> 01:26:27,251
Is your mother still alive?

1346
01:26:28,167 --> 01:26:29,501
Is she?

1347
01:26:31,084 --> 01:26:33,459
Yes, yes, yes, she's alive. Satisfied?

1348
01:26:33,542 --> 01:26:35,834
Your own flesh and blood!

1349
01:26:35,917 --> 01:26:37,626
To say they were dead!

1350
01:26:37,709 --> 01:26:39,542
Oh, that's awful!

1351
01:26:39,626 --> 01:26:42,126
I could never forgive you for that.

1352
01:26:42,876 --> 01:26:45,209
Aren't they good enough for you,
is that it?

1353
01:26:45,292 --> 01:26:48,959
A little Italian couple or Greek,
or whatever it is?

1354
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:51,667
- Oh, it doesn't matter.
- Doesn't matter!

1355
01:26:52,501 --> 01:26:54,334
I trusted you!

1356
01:26:54,417 --> 01:26:56,542
It shows what a yob I am.

1357
01:26:56,626 --> 01:26:58,667
You've ridiculed me.

1358
01:26:58,751 --> 01:27:01,667
I couldn't even visit a bathroom
without getting a belly laugh.

1359
01:27:01,751 --> 01:27:05,834
You were so clever with
your universities and your generals.

1360
01:27:05,917 --> 01:27:08,417
I gave you £5 to laugh at me!

1361
01:27:09,334 --> 01:27:11,209
That was your idea.

1362
01:27:12,834 --> 01:27:14,126
I know.

1363
01:27:15,417 --> 01:27:18,709
And I'll tell you another one.
Oh, you'll curl up at this.

1364
01:27:19,626 --> 01:27:22,001
If the holiday had gone well,

1365
01:27:22,084 --> 01:27:24,501
I was thinking of marriage.

1366
01:27:24,584 --> 01:27:27,417
You and me, marriage, eh?

1367
01:27:27,501 --> 01:27:29,209
Isn't that a scream?

1368
01:27:30,876 --> 01:27:32,834
Oh, do me a favour, love.

1369
01:27:32,917 --> 01:27:36,251
The first morning you'd have crawled away
with your tail between your legs.

1370
01:27:36,334 --> 01:27:38,584
Would I? Would I?

1371
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:40,001
We'll see!

1372
01:27:41,209 --> 01:27:44,917
I'm as good as you are any day,
in fact, I'm better!

1373
01:27:45,501 --> 01:27:47,626
What are you waiting for? More money?

1374
01:27:48,376 --> 01:27:49,751
Get undressed.

1375
01:27:54,959 --> 01:27:56,209
All right.

1376
01:28:05,251 --> 01:28:06,417
Chalky!

1377
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:14,084
Come on!

1378
01:28:15,126 --> 01:28:17,667
- Up United!
- Come on!

1379
01:28:18,667 --> 01:28:20,667
- Go on, push him!
- Up United!

1380
01:28:20,751 --> 01:28:21,709
Go on!

1381
01:28:24,042 --> 01:28:26,251
Eh, lovely!

1382
01:28:26,334 --> 01:28:28,626
Let's get down to steady drinking.

1383
01:28:28,709 --> 01:28:31,917
- 'Ere are, Fred.
- Percy will have to hurry up.

1384
01:28:32,001 --> 01:28:34,501
She'll have eaten him by now
and spat out the bones.

1385
01:28:35,292 --> 01:28:36,542
Oh!

1386
01:28:37,709 --> 01:28:40,251
Everything's washed up.

1387
01:28:40,334 --> 01:28:43,001
I thought you were so honest.

1388
01:28:43,084 --> 01:28:45,792
So exciting, so different.

1389
01:28:46,501 --> 01:28:48,334
I expect too much.

1390
01:28:49,709 --> 01:28:51,417
It's because I'm lonely.

1391
01:28:51,501 --> 01:28:54,167
I am so damned lonely!

1392
01:28:55,001 --> 01:28:57,459
Would you like a heavenly chorus?

1393
01:28:57,542 --> 01:29:01,959
Or you could do a Charlie Chaplin
down the middle of the Euston Road,

1394
01:29:02,042 --> 01:29:06,042
shuffling over the brow of a hill
with the traffic lights blinking mistily.

1395
01:29:06,834 --> 01:29:09,001
What a bloody fuss!

1396
01:29:10,001 --> 01:29:12,292
There's no call for swearing.
It is not clever.

1397
01:29:13,126 --> 01:29:17,417
If I've told you that the moon's green
or God's a woman,

1398
01:29:17,501 --> 01:29:20,292
I'm no different person from the one
you appreciated ten minutes ago!

1399
01:29:20,376 --> 01:29:23,959
- So shove that in your old mill chimney!
- Oh, no, I'll not have that!

1400
01:29:24,042 --> 01:29:25,542
You're a snob!

1401
01:29:25,626 --> 01:29:29,126
You're a one hundred per cent,
cast-iron, elastic-belted snob!

1402
01:29:29,209 --> 01:29:31,084
Not at all, I am no such thing!

1403
01:29:31,167 --> 01:29:33,292
Yes, you are!

1404
01:29:33,376 --> 01:29:36,917
You were ashamed until I told you
that my father was a general.

1405
01:29:37,001 --> 01:29:39,501
Then everything changes.

1406
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:42,792
You kiss my feet, you share my supper.

1407
01:29:42,876 --> 01:29:45,709
You've set up some kind of
a mission tent in my parlour.

1408
01:29:45,792 --> 01:29:50,834
You've used my flat and my time to bolster
what's left of your tatty old weekend.

1409
01:29:50,917 --> 01:29:52,917
You even go off and come back for more.

1410
01:29:53,001 --> 01:29:56,459
Seven times round the block,
planning my redemption.

1411
01:29:57,251 --> 01:30:02,334
But not once asking yourself if I care
a pig's bottom what you've planned.

1412
01:30:02,417 --> 01:30:04,292
Oh, lovely. Lovely!

1413
01:30:04,376 --> 01:30:06,792
Lovely language for a young lady!

1414
01:30:06,876 --> 01:30:09,126
If there was any planning to be done,
you did it.

1415
01:30:09,209 --> 01:30:12,501
You planned me out of £5 and a holiday.

1416
01:30:12,584 --> 01:30:16,626
At the end of which time, no doubt, you'd
have planned me out of everything else.

1417
01:30:16,709 --> 01:30:18,542
Me Premium Bonds, the lot!

1418
01:30:18,626 --> 01:30:21,459
My life's my own and I live as I please.

1419
01:30:21,542 --> 01:30:26,459
Every two-bit hero thinks he can
come in here and reorganise my life!

1420
01:30:26,542 --> 01:30:30,126
- Bloody marvellous!
- I have asked you to watch your language.

1421
01:30:30,209 --> 01:30:31,792
There's the door.

1422
01:30:31,876 --> 01:30:33,626
Nobody's stopping you.

1423
01:30:33,709 --> 01:30:35,501
Go on, slam it.

1424
01:30:35,584 --> 01:30:38,001
And shout "bum" through the keyhole.

1425
01:30:38,084 --> 01:30:40,626
By heck, your language!

1426
01:30:43,376 --> 01:30:44,876
Look…

1427
01:30:44,959 --> 01:30:47,584
the lies I tell are useful to me.

1428
01:30:47,667 --> 01:30:52,501
They're old friends, the people I invent.
I laugh with them and cry with them.

1429
01:30:54,501 --> 01:30:56,292
You think you've had a hard time?

1430
01:30:58,501 --> 01:31:02,167
Once my step-father came
into my room without knocking.

1431
01:31:02,251 --> 01:31:03,959
I wasn't wearing much.

1432
01:31:05,501 --> 01:31:09,251
After an unpatriotic incident, which
I won't bother to shock you with,

1433
01:31:09,334 --> 01:31:11,001
I left home.

1434
01:31:11,584 --> 01:31:13,626
Are you with me so far, padre?

1435
01:31:13,709 --> 01:31:14,876
Yes.

1436
01:31:14,959 --> 01:31:18,667
Maybe I exaggerated the incident,
I don't know. Maybe I wanted to.

1437
01:31:20,126 --> 01:31:22,751
Anyway, I grew up very quickly.

1438
01:31:22,834 --> 01:31:26,084
I examined my assets from the front
to the back to the sides

1439
01:31:26,167 --> 01:31:27,667
and I said to myself,

1440
01:31:28,376 --> 01:31:31,084
"Cyrenne, you've struck oil."

1441
01:31:32,667 --> 01:31:37,834
So once in a while, I lunch with Lady…
Lady this or that.

1442
01:31:38,834 --> 01:31:42,501
I spend £20 an ounce
on Woolworths' fragrant scent.

1443
01:31:43,376 --> 01:31:48,709
I race down Oxford lanes
with some dashing virgin boy.

1444
01:31:50,251 --> 01:31:52,834
And when the going's rough,
the general's there,

1445
01:31:52,917 --> 01:31:56,709
with lovely tales of Samarkand
and Rumble-Jumble-Pur.

1446
01:31:58,042 --> 01:32:01,334
I don't give a toot what anyone thinks!

1447
01:32:01,417 --> 01:32:03,834
I lead a goddamn wonderful life!

1448
01:32:03,917 --> 01:32:08,167
And as for the rest of my saga,
I deserve a bloody M.A.!

1449
01:32:10,292 --> 01:32:13,334
I have told you to watch your language.

1450
01:32:16,084 --> 01:32:18,667
I bet you could be Ginger if you really tried.

1451
01:32:19,917 --> 01:32:22,001
Are you coming to bed or aren't you?

1452
01:32:32,251 --> 01:32:34,251
The coach! God heavens, I'll miss it!

1453
01:32:36,959 --> 01:32:39,209
Oh, I'd just like to say,

1454
01:32:39,292 --> 01:32:42,001
I am glad I called, I'm damn glad.

1455
01:32:42,751 --> 01:32:45,292
I think you're quite a brave
and handsome woman.

1456
01:32:48,167 --> 01:32:50,334
Thanks very much for our little chat.

1457
01:32:53,542 --> 01:32:54,751
Oh!

1458
01:33:02,334 --> 01:33:04,042
'Ere, are all your lot here?

1459
01:33:04,126 --> 01:33:06,001
No, Percy Winthram's missing.

1460
01:33:06,084 --> 01:33:10,417
Oh, struth! Look, we've got three in jail,
five missing, believed drunk.

1461
01:33:10,501 --> 01:33:13,126
Well look, he's had it,
we're not waiting any longer.

1462
01:33:13,209 --> 01:33:14,417
Wagons away!

1463
01:33:22,251 --> 01:33:24,167
Hey!

1464
01:33:25,542 --> 01:33:26,709
Hang on!

1465
01:33:26,792 --> 01:33:28,584
Hang on! Oh, whoa!

1466
01:33:28,667 --> 01:33:31,251
- Ging! Ging!
- Come on, Perc!

1467
01:33:32,792 --> 01:33:34,501
- Ging!
- Come on!

1468
01:33:34,584 --> 01:33:35,709
Oh!

1469
01:33:38,376 --> 01:33:39,417
Well?

1470
01:33:39,501 --> 01:33:40,584
Eh?

1471
01:33:40,667 --> 01:33:42,251
Never mind about that. Well?

1472
01:33:42,876 --> 01:33:44,834
- Well what?
- Well bloody what!

1473
01:33:44,917 --> 01:33:47,084
What do you mean, well what?
Did you or didn't you?

1474
01:33:48,584 --> 01:33:50,959
It's in our shed at the bottom of the garden.

1475
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:52,751
I'll collect it Monday.

1476
01:34:30,709 --> 01:34:32,626
Eh, stop! Go on, stop! Eh!

1477
01:34:33,417 --> 01:34:35,376
Stop the bus, I wanna get off!

1478
01:34:35,459 --> 01:34:36,834
'Ere, Perc, what's up?

1479
01:34:39,959 --> 01:34:41,792
You're too late, the bike's mine!

1480
01:34:41,876 --> 01:34:43,917
Keep it! You can't ride
to heaven on a bike!

1481
01:35:15,084 --> 01:35:17,084
I forgot me rattle.
