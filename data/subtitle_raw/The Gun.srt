1
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,150
I picked up a pistol.

2
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,110
Need to do something with it.

3
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:14,110
The present situation is
better than anytime.

4
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,130
Let's go see Nishikawa, after a long time.

5
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:32,130
To threaten or protect someone...

6
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,140
I'm sorry, sorry.

7
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,150
Even shoot to kill easily.

8
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,150
What happened? Let's go.

9
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,150
- What are you standing up to?
- Saying goodbye.

10
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,160
Listen to me.

11
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,160
After all, it looks stupid
just send me home

12
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,160
I have been consulted in various ways
because it's crying

13
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,100
I was a nice person, really

14
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,100
I encouraged you seriously?

15
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,100
Oh I'm sorry for you.

16
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,110
Always like a beast well sure.

17
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,110
No.
Nishikawa didn't want me to say beast.

18
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,110
Not what has just begun.

19
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,120
Longing for American culture.

20
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,120
From defeat to the present...

21
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,120
What's that.

22
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Ae for Japanese...
Isn't it dangerous?

23
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,130
Possibility to do something with a handgun.

24
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,130
The joy of having a handgun.

25
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,130
That stimulation is important.

26
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,140
Long time no see.

27
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,140
Ah, such a long time.

28
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,140
Hey boring
shall we go to the dining room together?

29
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,150
No.. okay.

30
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,150
I really like this lecture.

31
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,150
Begins on September 3, 1945.

32
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:01,090
7 years throughout the occupation...

33
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,090
I'm hungry.

34
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,100
Hey.

35
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,100
No no no I'm not myself.

36
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,110
I emailed you last night
the story...

37
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,110
The cute one is for you
I'll do it.

38
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,110
So it's no good today.

39
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,120
Me recently I have no sex at all.

40
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Seriously.

41
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,120
Don't go crazy.

42
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,130
nothing, it doesn't matter if I'm gone, right?

43
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:43,130
If you are always
did it do well?

44
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,140
Cheers! Whistle.

45
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,140
Excuse me.

46
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,140
Ah coming!

47
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,150
Akani! It's a crab!

48
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,150
It will be a crab platter
crab! Crab!

49
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,150
I am sorry.

50
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,090
Look at this, I like crabs.

51
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,090
- Hokkaido? Origin hokkaido?
- From Tokyo...

52
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,090
What what what? Stop it...

53
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,110
I'll definitely do it today.

54
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,120
Not pretty.

55
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,120
For me today it doesn't matter.

56
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,120
Good, good, good..

57
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,130
I'll do it I'll do it!

58
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,130
Let's go karaoke.
We go to karaoke next?

59
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,130
I understand.

60
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,140
Let's drink again in a little quiet place.

61
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,140
I'm not interested in this woman, but...

62
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:30,100
Thanks to the pistol
I was in a good mood.

63
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,120
No...

64
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,090
Did you wake up? Sorry.

65
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,130
The people who hated me doesn't bother me.

66
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,130
Wait a sec!

67
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,070
Let's do it because we only need one more time.
You want to do it again?

68
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,070
Speaking like this will get angry.

69
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,070
If you really want to do it.

70
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,080
Be quiet, wait for the coffee.

71
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,080
Yes please

72
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,090
I have a boyfriend
let's meet when we like each other.

73
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,090
That's fine, right?

74
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,100
Yes America and others support.

75
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,110
The Syrian Democratic army, which is mainly kurdish power,
fully surround the city...

76
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,110
Coffee beans Columbia supremo.

77
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,110
Next time come to play.

78
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,120
Yup the Syrian Democratic army.

79
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,120
It is estimated that there are 3000 people in lacka city
against islamic state combatants...

80
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,130
I'll eat this fruit every morning
because it's delicious to eat.

81
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,130
Arakawa, itabashi-ku, Tokyo.

82
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,130
The man is lying down
there is a 110 call.

83
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,130
The police officer who rushed
I found the body of a man.

84
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,140
Dawn last night
near arakawa in itabashi-ku, Tokyo.

85
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,140
The body of a man was discovered.

86
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,140
Men with guns
there is a mark that was shot in the head

87
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,150
5 days after death
seems to have passed.

88
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,150
Men seems to be in his 40s to mid 50s.

89
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,150
Identity not yet clear.

90
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,160
At the metropolitan police department
see this as shooting.

91
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,160
Including the whereabouts of guns that seem to be weapons
investigating.

92
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
Next is sports.

93
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,170
Marlin's ichiro is in the history of media
carved its name.

94
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,170
Ichiro goes to cubs...
Ichiro is amazing.

95
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,180
What's wrong? Something is blue.

96
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,180
What?

97
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,180
Why is your face

98
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,120
June 11 since the pirates

99
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
I got a chance to start ichiro.

100
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,120
Sorry, bathroom.

101
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,140
All right?

102
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,160
All right?

103
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,160
I spit a little.

104
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,160
Really?

105
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,160
Okay, sorry.

106
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,180
What...

107
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,080
Wait! Hey what!

108
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,110
I hate it!

109
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,140
Through the act of polishing a pistol.

110
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,140
A pistol and deeper communication
I thought I could get it.

111
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Hello.

112
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,170
Mom? What's wrong?

113
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,170
Hmm?

114
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,170
What is that?

115
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,110
It's ok.

116
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,110
I'm sorry, I'm a little busy
yeah yes.

117
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,120
It was an empty room until yesterday.

118
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
Have you moved.

119
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,100
How easily you can kill your opponent.

120
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,100
Such human desires.

121
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,110
This silver color embodies.

122
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,110
Symbol of death.

123
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,110
Tanatos itself

124
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,090
I'm telling you to stop!

125
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,090
It hurts! It's a rush!

126
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,100
Sorry! Sorry!

127
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
You're saying it's sour!

128
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,100
Sorry!

129
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
Ah!

130
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,110
The voice of the last woman

131
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,110
I heard it next door.

132
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,110
You are? Hmm?

133
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,110
I did it.

134
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,120
How was it, tell me.

135
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,120
From now on
it seems to let me do it.

136
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,130
Are you going out?

137
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:43,130
Just do it
I had a friend and it was convenient.

138
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,140
Nishikawa is a terrible guy

139
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,140


140
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,140
Dangerous hmm?

141
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,140
Who has said that.
you're silly.

142
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,150
What the fucking shit.

143
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,150
Jabbe.

144
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,080
Now I have do a part-time.

145
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,090
It's like picking up in the next town.

146
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,090
Yes yes.

147
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,090
You're definitely back.

148
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,100


149
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,110
University is boring, isn't it?

150
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,110
I think I'll quit recently.

151
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,110
But it's only two years from now.

152
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,120
Why don't you skip it?

153
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
I don't really understand.

154
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,120
Yeah, it's subtle.

155
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,120
There is something interesting.

156
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:51,130
Hey you,
you don't really remember?

157
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,080
I'm sorry where did we meet?

158
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,080
Look, at the club for a year
there was a new party.

159
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,090
Then at that time, we come out together
I went to eat.

160
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:13,090
Remember? Ah.

161
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:17,090
Eh...

162
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,100
Yoshikawa..

163
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,100
Yoshikawa Yuko.

164
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,100
You has changed a lot,
that time your hair was short, right?

165
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,100
It might have been short.

166
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,110
There have been various things since then
I went to America homestay.

167
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:35,110
I recently returned to school again.

168
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:39,110
It was boring over there
this may be more.

169
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,120
Could I drink coffee too.

170
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
Where is the coffee?

171
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,120
Over there thank you

172
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,090
I want to do something fun.

173
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,090
What do you want to do.

174
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,100
Yeah I can't understand it myself
so thinking about you

175
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,100


176
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,110


177
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,110
Do you have sex?

178
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,120
Eh? No matter what.

179
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,120
So do you plan for that?

180
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Can I get a cigarette?

181
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:13,070
When I first met you
I feel like it was fun

182
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:22,090
With a woman named Yoshiko Yuko
dare to take a long time.

183
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:28,090
Let's purposely become intimate
the idea came to me.

184
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,130
It hurts! Hahaha.

185
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:10,130
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

186
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,180
What's wrong?

187
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,120
Aah, I'm a little drunk.

188
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,120
I'm just resting like this
are you alright?

189
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,130
But there's something strange around here, so
please go home early.

190
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,130
Dangerous? What happened?

191
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:17,130
Recently, the snatch case
it happens a lot.

192
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,140
It's aimed at young women,
snatched?

193
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,140
By the way, recently.

194
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,140
A warning sign you often see.

195
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,140
Well men have to be careful too.

196
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,150
As soon as possible.

197
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:33,150
Excuse me.

198
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,150
Thank you.

199
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,150
Then

200
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,170
I'm sorry.

201
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,170
Something?

202
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:56,170
Maybe drugs
did you find it around here?

203
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,170
Eh?

204
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:03,070
That's why drugs are like that.
Found around here.

205
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:20,130
Excuse me.

206
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,130
Why do such things do you ask?

207
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:29,140
Recently, a police officer with a dog
you often see it.

208
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,140
Is there a drug dog?

209
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,140
In any such case
I wonder if there was.

210
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,150
Oh, but this is on investigation...

211
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,150
No, I don't know.

212
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,150
One of the drug groups came
a few days ago.

213
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,160
It is true that the metropolitan police department arrested..
oh dear.

214
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Um... excuse me
why such a question?

215
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,160


216
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,160


217
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,110
Ah.

218
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,110
Graduation thesis
I'm doing deviance theory.

219
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:10,110
Such as drugs and suicide
data and preventive measures

220
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:13,120
I'm learning could be a little worried.

221
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,120
Graduation thesis is.

222
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,120
Are you in college? That's right

223
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,130
Professor
don't rely only on books.

224
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:28,130
Actually in the police and juvenile schools
we go visit.

225
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,130
What do you say.

226
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,140
So I asked around a little bit.

227
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,140
Excuse me, when I get drunk
because the number of people will increase a little.

228
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,150
I see.

229
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,150
I hope we can cooperate

230
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,150
I also have a job.

231
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,150
As soon as possible.

232
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,150
Thank you.

233
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,160
Thank you for your hard work.

234
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,100
If you have a handgun.

235
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,100
Would have been more nervous.

236
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,110
At that time
unbearable anxiety and fear

237
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:12,110
I was interested in stimulation.

238
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,110
From now on
let's carry a handgun.

239
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,100
Aim slim
to Allah and his apostles

240
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,100
I just declared my unbelief
the death penalty is imposed.

241
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,100
Islamic consensus.

242
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,110
Shooting a handgun

243
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:21,110
I often think about that.

244
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:24,110
Someday to shoot a pistol.

245
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:27,120
That's true.

246
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,120
Because this is a pistol.

247
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,130
Huh.

248
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:04,080
Yup there is something like that.

249
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,080
What are you thinking
I don't know

250
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,080
I don't really understand what it is

251
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:19,100
I'm the one who gets rid of the thoughts
that I hate.

252
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,100
Something great
I felt like saying.

253
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,100
That's not the case now.

254
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,110
It's weird to say
that kind of use.

255
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:37,110
That's a lie
you're making fun of many people

256
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:41,110
I hate it's good.

257
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,130
Give me a cigarette.

258
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:06,080
Because of you
it's become a habit again.

259
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,110
Nishikawa!

260
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,110
Let's go

261
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,110
I saw oh?

262
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:47,120
She's a good woman.

263
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,120
Eh, she? No way.

264
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,120
But I'm thinking..
so you haven't done it yet?

265
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,130
But that's good
as expected it looks good

266
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,060
I have a good body.

267
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,070
Did you fall in love? No way.

268
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:09,070
No...

269
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,070
Let's do that.

270
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,080
Let's go drink today.

271
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,080
- Tell us something.
- No, it's no good today

272
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,080
I will go shopping again ok.

273
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,090
Okay, not shopping.

274
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,090
Sometimes it's a sardine
sometimes it's always you.

275
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:30,090
Let's talk about women

276
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Hello.

277
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:40,100
Hmm? Now university yeah.

278
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,110
Mother? What.

279
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,110
Keisuke.

280
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,110
My parents
neither are true parents

281
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:54,120
I was in the facility.

282
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,120
Eh?

283
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,120
Is it really critical?

284
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,130
Hmm? Are you surprised?

285
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,130
I like that expression

286
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,130
I like this kind of face.

287
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:10,130
Yeah.

288
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:13,140
Ah, dad it's been a while.

289
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,140
Yeah that's right.

290
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,140
Why dad?
I've been home since this time.

291
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,150
Ah yes.

292
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,150
No, I'll go.

293
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:29,150
You're dying and you want to meet?

294
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:33,160
Whichever is okay to be honest

295
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:37,160
I didn't go to see you
it's scary if you get a grudge.

296
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,160
Oh yeah.

297
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,170
It's a pinch this month
I wonder if you can send about 10,000 yen.

298
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:46,170
No, I made a lot of effort.

299
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,170
I'm really sorry.

300
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:51,170
Yeah I understand

301
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:54,180
I'll get in touch with you.

302
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:58,180
Mom seems to be crying,
making fun of me.

303
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,120
"I'm already old."

304
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,120
Ah, it's already a class.

305
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,120
Bye again.

306
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:16,130
Alright, from now on
I'll go with that girl.

307
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:19,140
Uh! Is that cute child?

308
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,140
No, it's the one I did last time.

309
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,140
Why are you there? You're in love that woman.

310
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:30,150
Because I have to do it just to be able to do it,
is it a loss?

311
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:34,150
Oh... well no.

312
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,150
But for that cute girl
I have to go unnoticed.

313
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,160
Oh yeah.

314
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,160
Bye.

315
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,160
You can't be serious.

316
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:01,100
Huh phone's okay?

317
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,140
Hello.

318
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,140
What's wrong with that scar?

319
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,150
Oh!

320
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:17,110
You smell!

321
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:21,120
It hurts! I hate it! Stop!

322
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:27,120
Let's do it!
What's your name! Ah!

323
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:40,140
4-34-1 takashimadaira, itabashi-ku.

324
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:43,140
Well... room 102.

325
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,140
This is not the first time.

326
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,140
In tomorrow I'll be there.

327
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:54,150
Uh... the apartment name
could you tell me?

328
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:59,150
Why are you crying

329
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:03,090
I hate it!

330
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:05,090
Ah!

331
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,100
What happened?

332
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,100
Now it's a station.

333
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,110
Let's meet.

334
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:21,110
Well then in the university? Yup.

335
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,120
Hey.

336
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:42,130
I'm sorry I'm not good today.

337
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:49,140
There's no reason why it happens sometimes.

338
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,140
But.

339
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,140
Can you be with someone I'm glad.

340
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:59,150
Because she wore jeans,
a little boring.

341
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:03,090
What about your boyfriend?
Are you listening?

342
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:07,090
Boyfriend? There's no one.

343
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,090
Isn't it? You're kidding?

344
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,090
It's not a lie.

345
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,100
Man is good for a while

346
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:20,100
I'm fed up, when I'm done.

347
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:24,110
Do you feel lost.

348
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:27,110
Feeling worn

349
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:31,110
I don't know for men.

350
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,120
Is it worn out.

351
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:37,120
Somehow I feel like I understand

352
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,120
I don't know.

353
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,120
So what happened?

354
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:50,130
If you don't want to say
you don't have to say.

355
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,140
No, nothing.

356
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,140
It's a common thing.

357
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,080
But it's common
can't you answer me?

358
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,080
Don't laugh.

359
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,090
Walk a while?

360
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:22,100
What about me?

361
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,100
What?

362
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,100
Nothing.

363
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,110
Something strange for me today

364
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:36,110
I'm sorry

365
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:40,120
I'm sure I apologize.

366
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,120
What?

367
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,120
But there are times like that.

368
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,130
When no matter what you think.

369
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,130
There is.

370
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:57,130
So don't worry.

371
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,100
Wait, wait no.

372
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:46,110
Hey, can you come to my room?
but it's messy.

373
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:49,120
Why?

374
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,120
Ah... It's too late.

375
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,120
It's close to my house.

376
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,120
Oh stop.

377
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:04,070
If I go to your room now
I can't stand it

378
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,070
I'm weak.

379
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:11,070
You're weak now.

380
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:17,080
I may use you for that.

381
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,080
But like other guys
I have no confidence

382
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,090
I want to take good care of you.

383
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:26,090
Well think about it.

384
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,090
After getting well.

385
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:33,090
You can always call me.

386
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,100
To see her smile

387
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,100
I was satisfied

388
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,110


389
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,120
Thanks dear.

390
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,120
Here?

391
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:13,140
I don't really understand.

392
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,140
Many things have come to mind.

393
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:23,140
But something made
me feel good today.

394
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:29,150
Maybe in this way.

395
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,150
From now on I might rely on you.

396
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,160
Thank you.

397
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,160
Yup.

398
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,170
See ya.

399
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:47,170
Good night good night.

400
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,130
Until now.

401
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:20,140
I never tried to grasp.
something like this

402
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:53,150
Make it easy...

403
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,100
Oh!

404
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,130
Thank you.

405
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:35,130
It's toru, nice to meet you.

406
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:50,140
There are many friends here, so let's go.

407
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,150
What is your school like?
I'm doing alright.

408
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:01,090
Your parents seem to be fine
thanks to you.

409
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:04,090
From now on
because your blood-connected father.

410
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:06,090
You'll be nervous too.

411
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:09,100
What is superfluous I thought.

412
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:13,100
Hear that you will come
I was relieved and happy.

413
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:17,110
But why do you want to see me?

414
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:19,110
I know your feelings.

415
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:23,110
Maybe death is in front of you.

416
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:27,120
for various reaons,
you might want to apologize.

417
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,120
Yeah I think so.

418
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:45,130
This is it.

419
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:52,140
Sakuma-San Sakuma-San.

420
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,140
Sakuma.

421
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,140
Your son came here.

422
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:12,090
Creepy, his eyes and nose are similar to me.

423
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:16,100
Are you Toru?

424
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,100
If I shake my head here

425
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,100
I thought it would be interesting.

426
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:28,110
Toru.

427
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:31,110
Forgive me.

428
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:37,110
Will you give me

429
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,120
I got an interesting idea

430
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:48,130
I don't care anymore.

431
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:51,130
So get well soon.

432
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:59,140
Ah, ah!

433
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:01,040
What!

434
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,080
Sit down

435
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,090
I'm not toru

436
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:14,090
I'm sorry.

437
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,100
How was it?

438
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,100
Didn't look too alike.

439
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,100
Thank you! Eh?

440
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:30,110
Sakuma-San?

441
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:34,110
Sakuma!

442
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:03,060
What the...

443
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:05,060
What.

444
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:15,080
Are you sleeping?

445
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,080
Yes.

446
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:21,080
Excuse me, it's police.

447
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:25,090
I'm sorry.

448
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,090
I have something to ask you.

449
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:31,090
Do you have time now?

450
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:35,100
What is it? Suddenly
it's like a drama.

451
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,100
you really show a badge or something.

452
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,100
It's not a big deal.

453
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:45,110
It's not a stray cat.

454
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:49,110
It's a terrible story
I want to know something.

455
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:54,110
Near your home it's a park there.

456
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:59,120
And then I don't know anything.

457
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:04,130
Well, I'm visiting and going around.

458
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:09,130
Well me too I have a cat.

459
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:13,130
Really a terrible person
I'm sorry.

460
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:16,140
That's what police mean
are you carrying investigation?

461
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,140
Yeah.

462
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:23,140
Well that I'm not investigating.

463
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,150
The problem is.

464
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,150
Out of the cat's body.

465
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:32,150
The bullet was found.

466
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:36,160
It's a bullet 357 Magnum bullet.

467
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,160
It's powerful.

468
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:43,160
Too much that in Japan
it's the type that hasn't been released

469
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,170
I mean, the guy who played the cat.

470
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:50,170
Had a pistol
does that mean? Right?

471
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:57,180
In this case, even if the police is strange,
isn't it strange? Hmm?

472
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,180
Is that so yeah.

473
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:03,120
It's tough
I have to catch it quickly.

474
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:08,120
White jacket
you don't have around the waist

475
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,130
I have after all.

476
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:15,130
I have been witnessed you.

477
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:20,130
Well that.

478
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:24,140
Well here to talk, well that's it.

479
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:27,140
You see your neighbors no?

480
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:30,140
Even if you put it in a little
is that okay?

481
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,150
No, that's a little... I'm sorry

482
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:35,150
I'm sorry it's messy

483
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,150
I'm a detective, ha ha
I won't steal anything.

484
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:40,150
A stranger um...

485
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:43,160
I don't want to put it inside
is this normal?

486
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,160
Nmm.

487
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:48,160
Is that so? Yes.

488
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:55,170
Well then
would you like to talk in a coffee shop near you?

489
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:59,170
You too,
I doubt you chould clear it up.

490
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:05,110
I'll be waiting.

491
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,160
At that time

492
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,170
I heard a sound like a gunshot
there is a person.

493
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:01,100
On that day
a young man in a white jacket

494
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:05,100
I saw running near here
some people say.

495
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:12,110
To your parents before
you tried to send a photo stand.

496
00:53:12,110 --> 00:53:15,120
Is it a wedding anniversary or something?

497
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:20,120
It broke due to the negligence of the store.

498
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,120
When I heard that story

499
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,130
I was a little surprised.

500
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,130
You then.

501
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:31,130
If not angry
I'm sorry I don't have one.

502
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:35,140
Compensation for the amount of money
I heard you didn't receive it.

503
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:42,140
The clerk who witnessed and the clerk at that time
was the same clerk.

504
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:47,150
I remember well.

505
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:50,150
The day a cat was shot when?

506
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:53,150
Certainly recently around here
I ran back

507
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:55,160
I have to get back to my room soon.

508
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:58,160
What are you doing?

509
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,100
Up to that do I have to say?

510
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,100
Well for reference only

511
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:07,100
I kept her waiting in the room.

512
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:11,110
I made dinner and waited
are you right?

513
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:14,110
That thing is
I really don't care

514
00:54:14,110 --> 00:54:18,110
I'm really worried there is.

515
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:21,120
Why you then.

516
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:25,120
With your right hand in your pocket
did you run?

517
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:30,120
I don't remember well, but my smartphone was about to fall...

518
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,130
You know the arakawa incident, right?

519
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:36,130
Eh?
It's a case where a man was killed.

520
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:38,130
You know

521
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:41,140
I saw it on TV yup.

522
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:45,140
With bullets coming out of the man's head.

523
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:48,140
The bullet that came out of the cat's body.

524
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:51,150
It was the same kind.

525
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:53,150
Please give me a favor.

526
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:55,150
Is it a murder this time?
Okay...

527
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:58,150
Drink coffee it's almost over.

528
00:54:58,150 --> 00:55:00,150
Welcome

529
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:13,100
2 blends. Yes.

530
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:17,100
That badge
can you show me again?

531
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:23,110
Eh? Why?
No, I'm really a detective.

532
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,130
Here you go.

533
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:41,130
Excuse me. yes.

534
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:43,130
Something to write
can you lend me.

535
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,130
Ah yes.

536
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:51,140
Is this alright? Thank you.

537
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:56,140
Aida...For that reason
I can't think of being suspected.

538
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:02,050
Ok.

539
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:07,090
Let's get started.

540
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:13,090
Yup.

541
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:20,100
Actually I just lied to you.

542
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:25,110
Bullet from a cat
I don't sure if it was true.

543
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:29,110
It's also unknown if the cat was shot.

544
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:31,110
Eh? However.

545
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:35,120
The information that you heard a gunshot is sure.

546
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:40,120
Unfortunately cats
it's burned at the public health center.

547
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:45,120
From there
the bullet never came out.

548
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:49,130
Cats.

549
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:54,140
Clearly it seems that it was an artificial corpse.

550
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:02,080
Arakawa incident.

551
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:07,080
As a murder case involving gangsters
I'm investigating...

552
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:11,090
Me originally in charge of the case

553
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:15,090
I am a student
it doesn't matter at all.

554
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:18,090
Sorry I made you wait.

555
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:38,110
I'm digging that case.

556
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:43,120
From the beginning
I think that man is a suicide.

557
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:47,120
That corpse.

558
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:53,130
For being shot
it's too unnatural

559
00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:56,130
One single shot to the right temple.

560
00:57:56,130 --> 00:58:01,070
How to kill like that drama
there is no one who can do it.

561
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:03,070
It's not like shooting a gun.

562
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:07,070
It's originally an ugly scene.

563
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:10,080
Shooting messed up.

564
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,080
The person who was shot is off the key point.

565
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:18,090
Struggling struggling I'm dying.

566
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:23,090
As humans I was shot by a gun

567
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:26,090
I can't die right away.

568
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:29,100
By the time I die.

569
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:33,100
It takes a long time.

570
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:39,110
Yeah the man committed suicide.

571
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:43,110
And at the scene

572
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:46,110
I stopped by accident.

573
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:49,120
Ah maybe.

574
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:55,120
Someone who used to have a normal life

575
00:58:55,120 --> 00:59:00,130
I took away the remaining handgun

576
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:03,060
I think so.

577
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:08,070
The guy who picked up the pistol.

578
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:11,070
That guy

579
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:17,080
I'll shoot the animals first
I was wondering.

580
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:23,080
Then I heard that I heard a gunshot.

581
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:27,090
The dead cat corpse

582
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:29,090


583
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:33,090
To be honest, I was a little excited.

584
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,100
While putting your right hand in your pocket.

585
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,100
Young man.

586
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:46,110
Even if the gift to the parents is broken

587
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:49,110
I didn't make one sad face
that man.

588
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:51,110
but smiling.

589
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:56,120
I was running with excitement
witness testimony.

590
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:01,120
Very interesting.

591
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:05,130
That is it, it's your guessing.

592
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:09,130
The resolution of the case
it all starts with guessing.

593
01:00:09,130 --> 01:00:12,130
You need proof for that, right?
I have proof.

594
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:16,140
Then try saying that
your attitude.

595
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:21,140
There is no mistake
you have a pistol

596
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:25,140
I'm sure.

597
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:29,150
You and this case

598
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:32,150
I wanted to listen badly.

599
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:37,150
Really I want to hear your story.

600
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:45,170
When I first met you and said I'm police.

601
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:50,170
You're trying to hide your upset.

602
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:54,170
If there is no annoyance
you don't have to do that

603
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:58,180
and what a strange person.

604
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:01,120
When I shoot a cat

605
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:06,120
I'm sure it happened suddenly.

606
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:09,120
Still doing that.

607
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,130
You talk theoretically.

608
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:16,130
Even somewhere superficial.

609
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:20,130
It's just a lie.

610
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:23,140
But that's not proof.

611
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:26,140
You need proof, right?

612
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:29,140
Well there is no evidence.

613
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:33,150
From you.

614
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:36,150
Only evidence you are saying.

615
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:39,150
The criminal is.

616
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:44,160
Often the evidence
I want to hear it...

617
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,160
May I go back?

618
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,160
Not too persistent
I'll call the police.

619
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,170
How about another one?
Two blends.

620
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:53,170
Yes.

621
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:07,110
You.

622
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:11,110
Next time I want to shoot a human
don't you think.

623
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,120
Hah?

624
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:18,130
Humans come after cats.

625
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:22,130
Even if there are bullets left
maybe one or two more.

626
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:25,130
Get your pistol right now.

627
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:29,140
If you hate it
throw it away somewhere.

628
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:32,140
If you shoot, you will definitely get caught.

629
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:34,140
If you don't want to get caught.

630
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:38,140
Disassemble and put together with other junk
throw it away.

631
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:43,150
Then everything is over.

632
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:50,160
Killing people.

633
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:54,160
It may be strange, but.

634
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:00,170
Ordinary reason I can't say.

635
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:14,110
Like it.

636
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:19,110
My life will not be terrible.

637
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:23,120
You are young.

638
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:29,130
Sorry I made you wait

639
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:49,150
I will come again.

640
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:07,100
Thank you very much.

641
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:22,120
Ah.

642
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,120
You can understand what you say!

643
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:30,120
You said I would do it here!
Are you stupid!

644
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:37,130
You.

645
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:41,140
Next time I want to shoot a human
you're thinking.

646
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:53,150
Oh really? I really...

647
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:56,150
Humans come after cats.

648
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:58,150
Take care of yourself!

649
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:01,090
Fool!

650
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:04,090
It hurts..!

651
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:06,090
It doesn't hurt!

652
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:09,100
Already! Quit!

653
01:05:19,110 --> 01:05:23,110
If you shoot, you will definitely get caught.

654
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:26,110
If you don't want to get caught.

655
01:05:26,110 --> 01:05:30,110
Disassemble and put together with other junk
throw it away.

656
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:35,120
Throw it away somewhere.

657
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:08,090
Huh.

658
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:31,110
All right?

659
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,120
I've always liked it.

660
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,120
Eh? I can't stand it.

661
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:44,120
What are you saying?
What are you talking about?

662
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:47,130
Let's stop!

663
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:49,130
Huh.

664
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,130
Hey, stop it!

665
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:53,130
Quit! Oh!

666
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:56,140
Ow! Aa.

667
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:02,080
Why are you laughing.

668
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:07,080
Oh? What are you saying?
I'm not laughing.

669
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,080
Why are you laughing!

670
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:16,090
Huh.

671
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:42,120
Shoot people.

672
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:46,120
Pistols were built to shoot people.

673
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:51,120
Can kill people easily
it was built to be able to

674
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:54,120
I have it.

675
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:59,130
To shoot people
I think of it in my head.

676
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:01,030
Inevitable.

677
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:14,080
Then why with a pistol
shouldn't you shoot people?

678
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:18,090
Shouldn't you kill.

679
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:28,100
A person who can die.

680
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:33,100
Including me
overflowing in the world.

681
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:38,110
Conveniently here too.

682
01:08:38,110 --> 01:08:42,110
Hey, let's go to another house.

683
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:44,110
Hahaha!

684
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:47,110
Are you coming?
I was coming!

685
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:50,120
Sorry! I was waiting!

686
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,120
Drink! Let's drink!

687
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,120
Who's the kid?

688
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,130
just a relative's child.

689
01:08:59,130 --> 01:09:01,060
Then it's no good.

690
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:03,060
No, all right I sleep outside.

691
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:06,070
Look, sleep outside sorry.

692
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:08,070
Hahahaha...

693
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:13,130
The woman next door is in the supermarket

694
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:19,140
Tuesday or Thursday 8pm-9pm
I often went.

695
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:17,130
Do you want to try it on?

696
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:20,130
No I will just take it.

697
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:37,150
with handgun
I felt like I was alive.

698
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:33,140
What is it?

699
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:36,140
Is it cheating again? Good

700
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:39,150
I'm counting on you, daddy
only when this happens.

701
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:42,150
Ah dangerous
look ahead.

702
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:49,160
Wow!

703
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,160
Excuse me.

704
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,160
Is it alright?

705
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:08,110
Yes.

706
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:17,120
Hey what? So Sudden.

707
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,120
Wait inside.

708
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:23,120
Let's enter the room.

709
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:27,120
Stop.

710
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:33,130
Hey, stop it.

711
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:35,130
Hey you.

712
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:42,140
Stop it!

713
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:45,140
Are you out of your mind!

714
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:55,150
Hentai!

715
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:02,050
Ah.

716
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,120
Welcome.

717
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:36,120
What is it?
Sorry to keep you waiting.

718
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:44,130
Who? Shinji no.

719
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:47,130
With Misato
I did everything for Denny's...

720
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:49,130
What's wrong?

721
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:52,140
Nothing.

722
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:57,140
Hey, really
I want you to tell me.

723
01:15:57,140 --> 01:16:01,080
But don't go to college say dj.

724
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:04,080
Every Saturday seems to be.

725
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,090
Shinji's name
you can put it in for free.

726
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:10,090
Excuse me. yes.

727
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:14,090
One blend please
I have one blend.

728
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:18,100
You made fun of it, right? About me.

729
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:24,100
Don't play around
I feel like that.

730
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:28,110
Would you explain to me

731
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:31,110
I have to be clear that if
I'm the bad guy.

732
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:37,120
A good dj is on the way back from the event...

733
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,120
Hey, are you listening?

734
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:42,120
You should say something.

735
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:47,120
"I hate you"
"I didn't like that.."

736
01:16:49,130 --> 01:16:52,130
It's not a big deal.

737
01:16:52,130 --> 01:16:54,130
Hey Nishikawa.

738
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:58,140

739
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:00,140

740
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:08,080
You seems to be strange.

741
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:16,090
I have no idea what you are thinking.
thank you very much.

742
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:20,090
From the beginning
I was interested.

743
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:22,100
You're fun.

744
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,100
Training of training.

745
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:26,100
You shouldn't train.

746
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,100
But what happened?

747
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:31,100
Don't you know
what I'm thinking?

748
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:35,100
I don't know.

749
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:42,120
I don't care about that.
What? I can't hear that.

750
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:45,120
That's why I don't care.

751
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,120
I don't care.

752
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,120
Of course you don't understand

753
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:54,130
I'm dead, you're dead.

754
01:17:54,130 --> 01:17:58,130
My father died
someone there is dead.

755
01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:01,070
Well I'm not dead yet
which is fine.

756
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:03,070
I don't care that.

757
01:18:03,070 --> 01:18:06,070
No big deal anyway.

758
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:09,080
There's no such a thing.

759
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,080
Anyway, I...

760
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:14,080
Wahtever you like.

761
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:18,080
That's the case, then we

762
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,090
For example.

766
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:51,120

Ah.

769
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,100
Good evening, it's 7 o'clock.

772
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:53,110
Use a baby bottle
if you killed them by giving them drugs

773
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:57,120
21-year-old mother was arrested.

774
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:01,120
Ito mika
before the incident on sns.

775
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:05,120
The child posted that it was annoying
despite being a real child.

776
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:09,130
With children etc. Who were entrusted from the facility
I explained it to my friends.

777
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:11,130
For interrogation the suspect.

778
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:15,130
In a baby bottle
I didn't put any tablets.

779
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:18,140
Denying the charges.

780
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:43,160
In short.

781
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:46,170
If you kill it.

782
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:48,170
That child too.

783
01:20:48,170 --> 01:20:52,170
Crawfish scissors
will stop tearing.

784
01:20:52,170 --> 01:20:54,170
In short.

785
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:58,180
If you kill it.

786
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:00,180
Like me.

787
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:05,080
will be able to
live a peaceful life

788
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:21,130
In short, kill it.

789
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:30,140
In short, kill it.

790
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:55,160
It's a big deal.

791
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:00,170
Not a big deal.

792
01:23:00,170 --> 01:23:10,110
Kill people.

793
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:10,100
Really not a Bacca.

794
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:13,100
Hah, really.

795
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:19,110
Killing people.

796
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:22,110
It may be strange, but.

797
01:24:22,110 --> 01:24:27,120
Ordinary reason I can't say.

798
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:34,120
Fuck!

799
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,120
Why!

800
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:38,120
I can't do it.

801
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:41,130
Why.

802
01:25:41,130 --> 01:25:44,130
Uh.

803
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:34,110
I'm going to join today
will you come?

804
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:37,120
It looks pretty cute.

805
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,120
See you again
seriously stingy.

806
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:42,120
This may be the best so far.

807
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:44,120
May be the most cutey.

808
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:49,120
There is no point in living
I knew.

809
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:53,130
I decided to live till I die.

810
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:57,140
The big change is the realm of sex.

811
01:26:57,140 --> 01:27:01,070
By the war with America
4 years American movies wasn't released

812
01:27:01,070 --> 01:27:04,080
in Japan...

813
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:08,080
Nishikawa see you then.

814
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:10,080
Again.

815
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:32,100
Maybe.

816
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:34,100
Maybe we could.

817
01:27:36,110 --> 01:27:39,110
You got a problem.

818
01:27:41,110 --> 01:27:44,120
Inside me
there are similar ones...

819
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,120
Yes.

820
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:49,120
problems...

821
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:55,130
What is it.

822
01:27:55,130 --> 01:28:02,070
It may be cured
it may not be cured.

823
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:05,070
Even if it doesn't heal.

824
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:13,970
I might be able to ease it.

825
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:22,080
But now I'm angry.

826
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:29,090
But I'll wait.

827
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:59,120
I have to do it
there was something that didn't happen.

828
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:38,100
This is the side
I couldn't leave it.

829
01:31:22,130 --> 01:31:27,140
Soon, Tokaijin exit.

835
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,170

836
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:06,110
So late, this guy!
Please answer the phone!

837
01:32:06,110 --> 01:32:10,110
Ah? How many hours did you wait.

838
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,120
Eh?

839
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,120
Don't come in

840
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:18,120
I'm not going to enter.

841
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:21,130
Oh, I'm in trouble.

842
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:24,130
This is MA.

843
01:32:25,130 --> 01:32:27,130
Tell me what.

844
01:32:28,130 --> 01:32:30,140

01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:35,140
Hahahahaha.

847
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:38,140
It's annoying, so get off.

848
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:41,140
Pick it up.

849
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:53,160
Oh you.

850
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:55,160

Oh I understand.

853
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:03,100

857
01:33:47,150 --> 01:33:49,150
This is different.

858
01:33:50,150 --> 01:33:52,150
This is nothing.

859
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:52,140
Throw that gun away

860
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:56,150
You don't need that

861
01:34:56,150 --> 01:35:00,150
You don't need it in your life.

862
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:39,120
What? It's funny.

863
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:44,130
