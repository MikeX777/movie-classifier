1
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:09,375
Help!

2
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,458
Help!

3
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,708
Where am I?

4
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,708
This is my home.

5
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,625
Mr. and Mrs. Wang

6
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,541
Sit.

7
00:07:31,291 --> 00:07:32,291
Let's eat.

8
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,374
What a large fish!

9
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,416
It's nothing special.

10
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,333
Your cooking is as good as ever.

11
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,082
Chuqi's grades are out.

12
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,500
You're top of the class as usual.

13
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,083
Kunqiao,

14
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,915
how was your week?

15
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:52,916
Same as usual.

16
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,625
I just checked,
today marks exactly 3 years.

17
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,083
You still don't plan to turn yourself in?

18
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,750
I,

19
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,375
I plan to.

20
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,499
Mr. and Mrs. Wang,

21
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,208
thank you for treating me as family.

22
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,459
Dad, let me.

23
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,291
Sorry,

24
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,958
for ruining everybody's appetite.

25
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,375
Give it to Kunqiao.

26
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,208
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

27
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,000
I want a divorce.

28
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,208
I want a divorce.

29
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:34,958
What are you talking about?

30
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,624
This butterfish tastes fishy once cold.

31
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:38,250
Hurry and eat.

32
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:39,791
I think it's fishy already.

33
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,625
Why don't you go rest.

34
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,375
Kunqiao,

35
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:01,791
have you noticed,

36
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,708
there's no TV in the living room,

37
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,791
no newspapers, no magazines.

38
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,041
Because I think they're all garbage,

39
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:13,333
they don't do my kids any good.

40
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,375
You're right.

41
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,333
Mr. and Mrs. Wang really do know about education.

42
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,125
Really.

43
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:26,166
Of course, the children are also talented and hard-working.

44
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,625
Do you know?

45
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,375
Chutong is very interested in drawing,

46
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,333
and she's gifted.

47
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,833
But she needs encouragement

48
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:44,041
to reaffirm her interest and ambition.

49
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,083
Kunqiao,

50
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,708
I know you can draw.

51
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:57,166
I also know my daughter sneaks over to draw with you.

52
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,291
I can turn a blind eye,

53
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,375
but you should know,

54
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,708
you're not here as an art teacher

55
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,583
living in my basement.

56
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,166
Freedom is a great luxury,

57
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:15,375
I'm trying my best

58
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:16,875
to give you

59
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,875
and my daughter

60
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,000
some freedom, within limits.

61
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,376
For example, my children growing up in this home,

62
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,749
they can study music or drawing.

63
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,416
That is their freedom.

64
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,812
But they can't leave this family.

65
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:36,500
They can't choose to do whatever they want in the future.

66
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,791
This is where their freedom ends.

67
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,333
Kunqiao,

68
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,750
it's getting late.

69
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Dad,

70
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,830
You've had enough to drink.

71
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,291
You go to bed first.

72
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,666
I'm going to read in the study.

73
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:39,416
Where am I?

74
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,333
This is my home.

75
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,083
I saw you passed out in front of the hospital

76
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,458
Don't you remember?

77
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,375
There was a car accident.

78
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,666
Many died.

79
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,416
What time is it?

80
00:12:58,791 --> 00:12:59,791
What time?

81
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:01,958
What time?

82
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,833
How can you not remember anything?

83
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,791
Eat something first.

84
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,291
Thank you.

85
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,208
Why did you park by the side of the road?

86
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:32,708
People saw you talking to my son.

87
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,416
What did you do to him?

88
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,333
Were you intimidating him?

89
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,250
What did you say?

90
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,625
I can't remember a thing.

91
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:51,791
What you're saying...

92
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,916
I'm sorry.

93
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,333
Who is it?

94
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,500
I'll check.

95
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,250
Parents of Si An,

96
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,208
a student.

97
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,416
It's late.

98
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,125
What's the matter?

99
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,166
That bus driver still hasn't been found?

100
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,458
Not yet.

101
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,416
I hope he can turn himself in.

102
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,916
But from a legal standpoint,

103
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,791
he's not liable for anything.

104
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:39,208
How can that be?

105
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,958
Why on earth did he park on the roadside?

106
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,999
The school's parents' meetings had proven

107
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,200
that he couldn't stand children from well-off families.

108
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,582
He had malicious intent

109
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,143
and was driving dangerously on purpose.

110
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,291
I've been organizing Si An's belongings,

111
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:53,875
take a look.

112
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,791
Look who he drew here.

113
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,208
That's enough.

114
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,749
He'll be found sooner or later.

115
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,957
We should work on preparing

116
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,375
the legal procedures for this.

117
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:09,271
I hope he spends the rest of his life in prison.

118
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:10,708
That would be letting him off easy.

119
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,875
I think if we can find him,

120
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,500
and we families work together,

121
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,665
we can make him disappear.

122
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,749
What are you talking about?

123
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,750
Have you gone mad?

124
00:16:18,751 --> 00:16:19,875
Lynching wouldn't be right.

125
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,332
But I can understand how you feel.

126
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,666
How can you possibly understand?

127
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,874
Chuqi didn't die.

128
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,125
You're going too far.

129
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,540
We're all victims,

130
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:30,812
we should be working together.

131
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:32,375
Since when were we working together?

132
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,790
Ever since that parents' meeting, there is no "together".

133
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,874
Had we stood together that day,

134
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,083
that bus driver would have been let go.

135
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,791
Feigning kindness,

136
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,541
talking about fairness.

137
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,333
Now look,

138
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,750
our Si An is gone forever,

139
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,041
and the bus driver's missing.

140
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,291
Nobody's clear what happened between the driver and Chuqi.

141
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:55,854
If you won't find him, I will.

142
00:16:55,855 --> 00:16:57,207
He's not getting away with this.

143
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,040
We will be on our way.

144
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,041
I'm terribly sorry.

145
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:00,083
Let go!

146
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,541
I'm afraid I can't help you.

147
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,125
I'll take you to the police.

148
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,291
I remember now.

149
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,250
I saved a child.

150
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,250
I carried him and ran

151
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,375
and eventually made it to a small clinic.

152
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,208
That's my son.

153
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,416
I saved your son?

154
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,416
How is he?

155
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:52,083
He's crippled.

156
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,583
He asked me to pull over.

157
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,666
He gave me 100

158
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,958
to tie his shoes.

159
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,083
I parked the bus and got
off to tie his shoes.

160
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,500
Just then, a truck

161
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,958
crashed into the school bus

162
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,833
You can explain to them.

163
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:26,083
I'm calling the police.

164
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:28,208
I can't leave,they'll kill me.

165
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:30,875
Please,

166
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,041
let me hide.

167
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:38,083
Calm down first.

168
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,375
Ultimately,
Chuqi might be responsible too.

169
00:18:41,376 --> 00:18:43,499
How about we let
him stay here first.

170
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,708
We'll figure things out later.

171
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,458
How are your sketches today?

172
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,416
I learned a new song in class today.

173
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:40,958
I'll play it for you.

174
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,479
Dinner will be ready when we're back,

175
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,541
there's no time.

176
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:45,875
Just listen for a bit.

177
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:00,708
Here.

178
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:02,916
Chuqi,

179
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,416
come here.

180
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,208
Have you been feeling better?

181
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,375
You must stick to the rehab.

182
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:11,791
Okay?

183
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,541
Want a drink before dinner?

184
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,750
A coffee.

185
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,458
Not bad.

186
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:37,791
You're gifted.

187
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:39,833
It's no use.

188
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:43,333
Only you think so.

189
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,166
Whatever,

190
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:46,791
just focus on your drawing.

191
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,958
Not everybody who draws

192
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:50,791
has an imagination like yours.

193
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:52,958
I certainly don't.

194
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:00,958
Got to go.

195
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,625
I saw everything.

196
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,415
What did you see?

197
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:43,832
I saw you sneak into the basement

198
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,458
to find that murderer.

199
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:49,082
If you keep going,
I'll tell Dad.

200
00:22:49,083 --> 00:22:50,165
That murderer

201
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:53,041
ought to be locked in there and starved to death.

202
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,125
If he's a murderer,

203
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:57,791
then what are you?

204
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,166
Tell me.

205
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:03,040
Isn't this what you wanted?

206
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,771
Everybody who bullied you is now dead.

207
00:23:04,772 --> 00:23:06,082
You must be overjoyed.

208
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,041
Nonsense!

209
00:23:07,042 --> 00:23:08,500
That's not true.

210
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,416
How can you do that to your brother?

211
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:21,416
Are you okay?

212
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:41,937
Ms. Wang Chutong?

213
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,333
I'm your mother's friend.

214
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,583
I haven't seen her in some time.

215
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:51,500
She won't return my
calls or my messages.

216
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:53,208
But

217
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:56,175
she often calls me in the middle of the night

218
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,166
but doesn't say a word.

219
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:00,229
When I call, she just hangs up.

220
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,500
I can't even be sure it's her who called.

221
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:05,041
I'm very worried about her.

222
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:06,583
What's to worry about?

223
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,375
Any woman having an affair will have troubles,

224
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:12,291
especially in a family like ours.

225
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,183
She says she wants to leave your family.

226
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,791
What do you want me to do?

227
00:25:20,916 --> 00:25:21,916
Let you two be together?

228
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:23,875
Yes.

229
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,833
I never thought she would consider divorce,

230
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,583
but things are different now.

231
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,541
She's pregnant.

232
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:31,361
An accident.

233
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:33,166
She's always wanted another child.

234
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,979
It's not that she doesn't like you two,

235
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,229
she's just not happy.

236
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,541
This is none of my business,

237
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:40,791
I'm going home.

238
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:42,351
Your mother's always worried about you.

239
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,833
She doesn't to leave you alone in the house.

240
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:46,500
She wants you to leave with her.

241
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:48,291
Really.

242
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:49,583
Come with us.

243
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:52,500
Also, she says something's not right in the house.

244
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:54,083
She keeps sensing

245
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,485
that there's a ghost in the house.

246
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:01,375
Our family is a bit off.

247
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:03,416
But,

248
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:06,125
who that ghost is still isn't clear.

249
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,250
My brother.

250
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,458
How did you know I was here?

251
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:33,833
I followed you.

252
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:35,541
Why?

253
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:39,583
I wanted to protect you.

254
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,750
Thanks.

255
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,240
Your mother isn't feeling well.

256
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:13,207
Let's just eat this.

257
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:14,958
Then I'll bring this bowl to Mom.

258
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,781
I said your mother's
not feeling well.

259
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:19,541
Just eat.

260
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:42,125
Don't forget what you promised me.

261
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,375
Aren't you letting down your daughter?

262
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,750
What are you doing?

263
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:50,083
It's late, why aren't you sleeping?

264
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,250
I can't sleep,

265
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:54,041
eating some ice cream.

266
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,041
Can't sleep either?

267
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,500
Have some.

268
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Don't bother.

269
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:24,208
If you want to go, just go.

270
00:29:36,416 --> 00:29:37,625
I'm going back to my room.

271
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:40,291
If you leave, don't come back.

272
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,625
Chuqi,
I'm going to your school today.

273
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:53,500
What for?

274
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:56,208
It's nothing, just some things to take care of.

275
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:10,083
Please come here to talk about Wang Chuqi.

276
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,396
Yes, We all know.

277
00:31:12,397 --> 00:31:16,250
Wang Chuqi excelled at his previous school,

278
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,165
moreover, he's repeating a grade at this school.

279
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:23,625
But academic performance assesses only one ability.

280
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:27,332
Chuqi doesn't interact much with other students,

281
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,458
and he barely does any extracurricular activities.

282
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:32,041
If this continues,
the dynamic between him and other students

283
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:33,041
I understand.

284
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:35,458
So, Chuqi,

285
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:37,291
don't fall asleep in class.

286
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:40,083
Don't read books you're not supposed to in class.

287
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:43,541
Let's try to fit in with the other students.

288
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:47,415
But I hope the teachers can forgive him

289
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:49,666
especially after what he's gone through.

290
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:50,916
Yes?

291
00:32:02,166 --> 00:32:03,166
Chutong,

292
00:32:03,416 --> 00:32:04,707
is that your mom?

293
00:32:04,708 --> 00:32:07,374
She's pretty, like a movie star.

294
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:08,541
Wait a second.

295
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:10,333
You play first.

296
00:32:16,625 --> 00:32:17,625
What are you looking at?

297
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:26,750
Somebody tattled on you?

298
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
It's nothing.

299
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,666
I haven't been listening in class.

300
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:33,458
Well,
you've already done it once.

301
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:35,625
I guess sleeping is more important

302
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:43,458
Play in a bit?

303
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:44,666
Yes.

304
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:01,458
Dad, my trumpet class tomorrow
was rescheduled to the morning.

305
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:03,291
Can I eat lunch outside?

306
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,333
Okay.

307
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,500
Thanks Dad.

308
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:12,083
Mom's not feeling well anyways,

309
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,583
I'm taking her to the hospital tomorrow morning.

310
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:27,250
Nobody will be home tomorrow.

311
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:30,250
Or, let's go out and play.

312
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:35,000
Yu Kunqiao,

313
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:37,286
Are you really planning on just staying here forever?

314
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:40,333
Don't you get sick of being here so long?

315
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:04,125
Yu Kunqiao,

316
00:34:05,083 --> 00:34:07,541
let's leave this house together, okay?

317
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,083
Say something.

318
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:15,582
Why won't you talk?

319
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,582
Speak.

320
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:21,583
You don't know how lucky you are to have a family like this.

321
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,082
Why are you in my room?

322
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:47,875
Get out.

323
00:34:47,876 --> 00:34:50,041
Dad's bringing Mom to the hospital tomorrow.

324
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:51,666
Do you know why?

325
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,374
Get out.

326
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:55,207
Mom's pregnant.

327
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:56,750
Dad doesn't want the child.

328
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:58,791
That's their business.

329
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,583
It doesn't concern you.

330
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,458
If you dare betray this family,

331
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,291
betray me and Dad,

332
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:07,833
just try.

333
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,208
Everybody sit.

334
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,666
Sit back down.

335
00:36:22,791 --> 00:36:25,125
I'll give you 100 to tie my shoes.

336
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:28,791
I'm asking you to tie my shoes, you hear me?

337
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:32,583
What are you doing?

338
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:40,583
Don't think you can do anything just because your family's rich.

339
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,541
I'm begging you,

340
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:45,250
tie my shoes.

341
00:36:46,416 --> 00:36:49,416
Otherwise they won't let me off.

342
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:58,166
Tie his shoes.

343
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:56,750
Everybody stay where you are!

344
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,333
Don't move!

345
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:08,833
Who's there?

346
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:11,833
Who is it?

347
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:16,291
Chutong, is that you?

348
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:19,750
Chutong?

349
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:29,000
It's late, why aren't you sleeping?

350
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,000
What are you giving me?

351
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:56,208
Tie my shoes.

352
00:39:58,583 --> 00:39:59,583
What are you saying?

353
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:04,666
What's wrong, Chutong?

354
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:08,166
What are you doing?

355
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,708
My sister's just sleepwalking,

356
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,250
I'll bring her back.

357
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:36,125
Return this to your sister.

358
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,208
Everybody's gone out.

359
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:06,625
Have this for lunch.

360
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:26,375
Bring the bowl upstairs later.

361
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,166
Chutong,

362
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:04,708
Chutong, I put the bowl away.

363
00:43:19,125 --> 00:43:20,125
Chutong

364
00:43:40,666 --> 00:43:41,833
Coward.

365
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:46,021
Aren't you curious what's inside the study?

366
00:43:46,022 --> 00:43:48,333
Your father must keep it locked for a reason.

367
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:52,708
Come upstairs with me,

368
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:57,750
What are you doing?

369
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:01,875
I have some new drawings,
come take a look.

370
00:44:24,416 --> 00:44:27,291
So, all the house's photographs are by your father?

371
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,083
They're by his friend.

372
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:30,665
A foreigner.

373
00:44:30,666 --> 00:44:32,166
But I hear he's passed away.

374
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:35,541
All the photographs in this house

375
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:36,750
are done by him.

376
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,291
He was Dad's good friend during college in New York.

377
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:43,625
When they were younger, they wanted to open a photo studio.

378
00:44:43,791 --> 00:44:46,125
Later, Dad was called back to run the family business,

379
00:44:46,126 --> 00:44:47,583
and start a family.

380
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:50,125
I heard his friend never forgave him,

381
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:52,665
and that he later disappeared.

382
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:54,416
Dad tried to find him,

383
00:44:55,541 --> 00:44:58,416
but 'til his death, they never met again.

384
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:00,458
Your father studied photography,

385
00:45:00,459 --> 00:45:02,416
so he must be able to appreciate drawing.

386
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:06,249
He says he's not interested,

387
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:07,666
but that may not be true.

388
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:09,500
You still don't get it.

389
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,312
He never became a photographer,

390
00:45:12,313 --> 00:45:13,875
and he won't let me draw.

391
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:18,083
He wants to impose that same kind of torment on others.

392
00:45:18,958 --> 00:45:21,916
Besides, he's never really cared about me.

393
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:25,708
Right, last night

394
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:27,958
you sleepwalked to my room.

395
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:30,458
Do you remember what you said?

396
00:45:30,459 --> 00:45:31,541
What you did?

397
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:34,083
Last night?

398
00:45:36,416 --> 00:45:38,208
Maybe you had a nightmare?

399
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:40,958
I never have nightmares.

400
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:46,125
In the end, Chuqi brought you back upstairs.

401
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:47,958
Ask him if you don't believe me.

402
00:45:57,666 --> 00:45:59,416
You never have nightmares?

403
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:08,416
Okay,

404
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:09,875
I'm going back down.

405
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:40,000
Chutong

406
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:46,125
Chutong

407
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:48,125
Chutong

408
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,300
Chutong, is there somebody else in the house?

409
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:56,625
Chutong, who's there?

410
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,208
Chutong

411
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:14,625
Chutong

412
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:20,500
Chutong, are you okay?

413
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:22,958
Chutong, what's wrong?

414
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:24,541
Tell me where it hurts.

415
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:25,791
My leg.

416
00:48:30,291 --> 00:48:31,521
What on earth happened?

417
00:48:31,522 --> 00:48:33,374
I heard people come into the house,

418
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:34,958
there were footsteps running down the stairs.

419
00:48:34,959 --> 00:48:36,833
I also heard Chutong scream.

420
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:39,250
So I ran up,
but the door was locked.

421
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:41,333
There was nobody here when we came back.

422
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:42,828
And this door wasn't locked.

423
00:48:47,666 --> 00:48:48,666
Was somebody here?

424
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:50,833
No.

425
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:52,291
Is he telling the truth?

426
00:48:58,125 --> 00:49:00,791
If he says it's
true, then it's true.

427
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:05,500
Let's take Chutong to the hospital.

428
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:06,708
Let's go.

429
00:49:38,541 --> 00:49:39,875
What are you looking for?

430
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:42,291
Nothing.

431
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:45,958
It just seems strange.

432
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,208
Is Kunqiao lying?

433
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:56,375
You can't think that Chutong is lying?

434
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:00,208
Maybe both are.

435
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,250
Madam, why are you here?

436
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:41,875
Thank you.

437
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:52,125
Kunqiao.

438
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,666
If you need anything,

439
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:56,208
I'll bring it for you next time.

440
00:50:58,375 --> 00:50:59,083
It's okay,

441
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:00,375
I'm all set.

442
00:51:28,541 --> 00:51:29,541
Here,

443
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:32,833
sit.

444
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:46,333
What kind of person do you think my husband is?

445
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:48,333
Successful career,

446
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:50,791
beautiful family.

447
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:56,791
He has it all.

448
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,375
When my husband was younger,

449
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:07,583
he wanted to be a photographer while abroad.

450
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:11,333
Then his family called him back to run the family business.

451
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,750
He refused.

452
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:17,833
Do you know how they got him back?

453
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:20,958
They froze his credit cards

454
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:22,608
and terminated his rental contract.

455
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:24,604
They wouldn't give him a dime.

456
00:52:24,605 --> 00:52:26,833
In the end, he had to comply and come back.

457
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,166
Without his wealthy family,

458
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:35,791
he was just a poor student who couldn't pay the bills.

459
00:52:36,541 --> 00:52:38,958
Ultimately, he had to succumb to his family.

460
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:41,791
And not just himself,

461
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:44,750
but his wife as well.

462
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,000
I think this family,

463
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,750
came about from his sacrifices.

464
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:15,291
Madam,
I really didn't hurt Chutong.

465
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,875
Chutong, Chuqi, you're back.

466
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:28,166
Dad,

467
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:30,666
can Kunqiao not eat at this table going forward?

468
00:54:30,875 --> 00:54:32,082
He hurt Sister.

469
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:33,125
Eat your food,

470
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:34,746
it's none of your business.

471
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:37,125
Why are you defending him?

472
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:38,981
-Isn't your leg his fault?
-Shut up.

473
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:43,125
Dad,

474
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:46,208
I saw Sis get into a stranger's car the other day.

475
00:54:46,541 --> 00:54:47,666
I told her to get out.

476
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:48,958
Did I offend you?

477
00:54:49,541 --> 00:54:50,416
Do you have to tattle?

478
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:51,327
Why must you hide from Dad?

479
00:54:51,334 --> 00:54:52,458
Who do you think you are?

480
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,583
Put the knife down.

481
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:01,791
We're one family.

482
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:03,875
Let's eat a proper meal.

483
00:55:06,958 --> 00:55:08,708
How long do you want to keep pretending?

484
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:10,333
He won't turn himself in.

485

Traditional Wedding Vows Examples

486
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,291
I'm happy to have the honor of becoming your wife.

487
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:24,041
I know in your heart, cameras are #1.

488
00:56:24,042 --> 00:56:26,083
But I hope I can become #2.

Yu Kunqiao

492
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:22,416
Madam, what is it?

493
00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:24,458
Come up for a minute.

494
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:29,583
I think Chutong she

495
00:57:30,583 --> 00:57:33,375
Chutong may be possessed by a ghost.

496
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:36,458
Madam,

497
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:38,666
what are you talking about?

498
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:41,000
I also know by who.

499
00:57:43,125 --> 00:57:44,125
Madam,

500
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:46,291
is that blood?

501
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:48,125
Where are you hurt?

502
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:51,750
This ghost possessing Chutong, you also know her.

503
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:53,375
Trust me just this once.

504
00:57:54,666 --> 00:57:55,707
I'll take you to find her.

505
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:56,833
Madam, what on earth is going on?

506
00:57:56,833 --> 00:57:57,993
That child helped you before.

507
00:57:58,541 --> 00:57:59,687
Madam, let go of me.

508
00:57:59,688 --> 00:58:00,916
She shouldn't have died.

509
00:58:01,625 --> 00:58:02,333
What's wrong with you?

510
00:58:02,334 --> 00:58:03,708
Don't you remember?

511
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:15,125
What is it?

512
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:16,125
Are you hurt?

513
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,458
What the hell is going on?

514
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:26,458
I don't know.

515
00:58:28,666 --> 00:58:29,666
Is everybody okay?

516
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,291
Listen to me.

517
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,260
There's something not right with this house.

518
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:38,291
I really saw Lulu.

519
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:39,292
Nonsense!

520
00:58:45,458 --> 00:58:46,458
Since everybody's okay,

521
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:48,416
go back to bed.

522
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:02,708
Don't think I don't know what you're doing.

523
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:05,791
Chutong,

524
00:59:06,208 --> 00:59:07,208
bring her upstairs.

525
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,312
What are you still doing here?

526
00:59:47,313 --> 00:59:48,333
I'm just worried.

527
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:49,416
There's no injury.

528
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:51,083
It's just duck blood.

529
00:59:52,291 --> 00:59:55,583
You two stop that ghost
nonsense, got it?

530
01:00:04,708 --> 01:00:07,791
Lulu,
Don't be afraid 来 Come here.

531
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:12,457
Lulu, tell everybody.

532
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:15,458
What have you observed?

533
01:00:15,791 --> 01:00:17,957
Is it like what the others say?

534
01:00:17,958 --> 01:00:19,957
Does he go too fast,

535
01:00:19,958 --> 01:00:22,166
swerve, and drive dangerously?

536
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
No.

537
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:31,665
He's not a bad person.

538
01:00:31,666 --> 01:00:35,208
But my classmates always like to bully him.

539
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,250
Everybody heard her.

540
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,250
The class monitor can attest,

541
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,291
Yu Kunqiao has worked at the school for so many years,

542
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:47,708
and he's an orphan.

543
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:50,000
Really, he doesn't have it easy.

544
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:53,833
Let's all give him another chance.

545
01:00:55,291 --> 01:00:57,916
Yu Kunqiao,
why don't you apologize?

546
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:16,250
What?

547
01:02:17,458 --> 01:02:18,915
I learned a new song,

548
01:02:18,916 --> 01:02:19,708
I want to play it for you.

549
01:02:19,709 --> 01:02:22,208
I'm not in the mood,
close the door.

550
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:33,666
Why are you entering?

551
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,041
Go back to your room.

552
01:02:36,583 --> 01:02:38,833
Can I stay here for a bit?

553
01:03:04,541 --> 01:03:06,250
Want to sketch with me?

554
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:19,500
Where are you two going?

555
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,500
I'm going to sketch.

556
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:23,041
I'm going with her.

557
01:03:30,166 --> 01:03:31,625
Chuqi, go back to your room.

558
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:45,188
You're not going to stop me, are you?

559
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:49,124
Why would I stop you?

560
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,500
Ask Kunqiao to go with you.

561
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:53,000
He needs to get out too.

562
01:04:16,541 --> 01:04:19,166
Mr. Wang Come back soon.

563
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:25,375
Help me find something.

564
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:52,750
This is a good spot for sketching.

565
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:55,583
Are we going too far?

566
01:06:04,625 --> 01:06:06,333
Let's not go back.

567
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:11,208
What are you saying?

568
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:15,916
Let's just keep going along this river.

569
01:06:16,416 --> 01:06:17,416
We can be free.

570
01:06:22,083 --> 01:06:23,333
Where is it, Mom?

571
01:06:24,958 --> 01:06:26,458
All the way inside.

572
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:27,833
Do Mom a favor.

573
01:06:58,583 --> 01:06:59,958
A bit further inside.

574
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:14,291
The shelf above.

575
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:18,375
Is it this, Mom?

576
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,500
Mom

577
01:07:32,708 --> 01:07:34,562
It's getting late, let's go back.

578
01:07:34,563 --> 01:07:36,250
If we're too late, Sir won't be happy.

579
01:07:36,541 --> 01:07:37,957
I'm not going back,

580
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:39,358
if you want, you can go back alone.

581
01:07:39,458 --> 01:07:41,229
I used to think maybe you're just scared.

582
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:43,000
But now I realize you're just running away.

583
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:45,416
Don't you want to choose a normal life?

584
01:07:46,958 --> 01:07:47,958
Yes.

585
01:07:48,208 --> 01:07:50,208
Your family's rich, you have choices.

586
01:07:51,083 --> 01:07:52,083
What choices do I have?

587
01:07:52,084 --> 01:07:54,271
Some don't even if they are rich.

588
01:07:54,272 --> 01:07:56,125
Think of the children on that bus.

589
01:07:56,458 --> 01:07:57,625
Did they have choices?

590
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:02,000
Was that really an accident?

591
01:08:02,708 --> 01:08:04,125
What are you hiding from?

592
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:07,858
You drove that school bus everyday.

593
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:10,541
The students' names, how they look,

594
01:08:11,166 --> 01:08:12,500
you really don't remember?

595
01:08:17,083 --> 01:08:18,083
Let me help.

596
01:08:23,708 --> 01:08:26,083
Don't you feel at all responsible for that accident?

597
01:08:26,084 --> 01:08:28,374
Or are you just a coward?

598
01:08:28,375 --> 01:08:30,646
You don't really believe we view you as family?

599
01:08:30,647 --> 01:08:32,875
Don't you feel that this family is very strange?

600
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:34,416
She's not your mother.

601
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:41,125
What did you say?

602
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:43,875
She's not your mother.

603
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,625
She's the mother of Lulu, the class monitor.

604
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:57,083
If you don't want to draw, I'm going back.

605
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,500
Yu Kunqiao,

606
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:07,750
stop!

607
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:13,708
Now that you remember,
why are you going back?

608
01:09:14,833 --> 01:09:16,833
Aren't you afraid to stay in a home like that?

609
01:09:17,708 --> 01:09:19,208
You shouldn't go back.

610
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,291
You should go to the police station.

611
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:24,250
Kunqiao

612
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:29,791
Yu Kunqiao,
I'm begging you not to go back.

613
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:31,666
Yu Kunqiao!

614
01:09:37,666 --> 01:09:38,666
Dad!

615
01:09:39,791 --> 01:09:40,791
Dad!

616
01:09:41,625 --> 01:09:42,625
Dad!

617
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:46,915
Who locked you in there?

618
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:47,916
It was Mom.

619
01:09:48,541 --> 01:09:49,750
Why did she lock you in there?

620
01:09:50,041 --> 01:09:51,041
I don't know.

621
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:50,916
We've been married for so long,

622
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:54,375
How great would it be to get rid of these cameras?

623
01:10:57,583 --> 01:10:59,703
Why haven't you taken Chuqi to shoot photos recently?

624
01:11:00,583 --> 01:11:02,375
He's always liked photography,

625
01:11:02,666 --> 01:11:03,875
just like you two.

626
01:11:04,833 --> 01:11:06,958
Not like her sister, who likes to draw like I do.

627
01:11:08,208 --> 01:11:09,958
Sister and brother, from different fathers.

628
01:11:10,333 --> 01:11:13,000
So it's normal for their interests to be different.

629
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,396
But do you love them equally?

630
01:11:15,397 --> 01:11:16,708
Stop talking nonsense.

631
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:19,208
Chuqi's here.

632
01:11:26,166 --> 01:11:28,750
Do you remember what I said at our wedding?

633
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:34,653
The most precious thing to you was your camera collection,

634
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:37,500
but I hoped I could come in second place.

635
01:11:40,291 --> 01:11:41,958
Only later, I realized,

636
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:44,458
I couldn't even be third place,

637
01:11:45,708 --> 01:11:47,250
because you have Chuqi.

638
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:49,124
You two have a son.

639
01:11:49,125 --> 01:11:50,125
Enough.

640
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:52,250
Drop the act.

641
01:11:58,083 --> 01:12:00,791
Chuqi, this is your camera.

642
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:05,166
All the cameras and lenses in this room are yours.

643
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:06,499
Do you like them?

644
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:07,250
I don't know photography.

645
01:12:07,251 --> 01:12:08,541
It's okay if you're not good.

646
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:10,041
He can teach you.

647
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:12,833
You're his little genius photographer.

648
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:13,958
Here.

649
01:12:13,959 --> 01:12:15,333
Let me see your eyes,

650
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:22,458
（Roy）

651
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:29,416
Ah, you're not Chuqi.

652
01:12:29,833 --> 01:12:32,415
Chuqi should have gray eyes.

653
01:12:32,416 --> 01:12:33,625
Give me the camera.

654
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:35,833
Chuqi is gone,

655
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,250
This camera

656
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:40,666
is gone too!

657
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:49,541
-Stop!
-All of it, gone!

658
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:00,750
Sister and brother, from different fathers.

659
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,437
But I hoped I could come in second place.

660
01:13:02,438 --> 01:13:03,750
Ah, you're not Chuqi.

661
01:13:04,208 --> 01:13:06,833
Chuqi should have gray eyes.

662
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:12,583
Give the driver 100,

663
01:13:13,125 --> 01:13:14,791
get him to tie your shoes.

664
01:13:18,291 --> 01:13:20,000
If Chuqi tells you to go, you go.

665
01:14:27,208 --> 01:14:28,541
Why are you burning my drawings?

666
01:14:29,375 --> 01:14:30,541
And my mom's things?

667
01:14:43,375 --> 01:14:44,416
Come eat.

668
01:14:46,541 --> 01:14:47,541
Chutong,

669
01:14:49,625 --> 01:14:50,833
look who's back.

670
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,500
Kunqiao,

671
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
sit.

672
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:27,583
You've had a difficult few years,

673
01:15:28,416 --> 01:15:30,333
you've suffered a great deal because of me.

674
01:15:31,166 --> 01:15:33,250
I want to apologize to you,

675
01:15:34,958 --> 01:15:35,791
Xiaoxue.

676
01:15:35,792 --> 01:15:37,833
Don't call her by my mother's name.

677
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:44,041
Chutong, give me some time.

678
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:46,958
Let me say some things to your mother.

679
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:53,166
Xiaoxue, do you remember?

680
01:15:53,958 --> 01:15:55,250
We had an opportunity

681
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:58,125
to build a wonderful family.

682
01:15:59,666 --> 01:16:00,750
Your daughter?

683
01:16:02,333 --> 01:16:03,415
Asleep by now.

684
01:16:03,416 --> 01:16:04,541
She's with my sister.

685
01:16:04,958 --> 01:16:08,416
By the way,
last time you asked me to find Roy.

686
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:11,541
I went to the art school and asked everybody.

687
01:16:11,875 --> 01:16:13,435
A lot of people haven't seen him since.

688
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Forget it.

689
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:20,541
Anyways, our photo studio has closed already.

690
01:16:21,416 --> 01:16:24,500
Roy must be done with me.

691
01:16:25,458 --> 01:16:26,778
We'll never see each other again.

692
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,250
Well, for those foreigners,

693
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:32,583
it's hard for them to understand Chinese families.

694
01:16:43,916 --> 01:16:46,271
Actually now I worry about these "suitable" women

695
01:16:46,272 --> 01:16:48,000
that my family's arranged for me.

696
01:16:49,416 --> 01:16:53,291
The thought of spending your life with somebody unfamiliar,

697
01:16:55,416 --> 01:16:56,416
that's what I fear.

698
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,833
You know what condition I negotiated with my father?

699
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:02,125
I said,

700
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:05,041
Just don't force me to marry a stranger.

701
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,333
Then why don't I marry you?

702
01:17:15,541 --> 01:17:17,083
But don't get too excited yet,

703
01:17:18,208 --> 01:17:20,128
I have a daughter that needs taking care of too.

704
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:30,125
Actually, we became acquainted with each other

705
01:17:30,416 --> 01:17:32,541
as friends,

706
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:34,625
all the way to this day.

707
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:36,916
And I know,

708
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:40,416
in your heart, cameras are #1.

709
01:17:43,375 --> 01:17:46,916
But I hope I can come in second place.

710
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,125
Are you happy today?

711
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:55,083
Yes.

712
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:56,250
Xiaoxue,

713
01:17:57,625 --> 01:17:58,625
thank you.

714
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:01,958
Please take your places, we're ready for pictures.

715
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:06,250
Stand still.

716
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:14,125
Let's have more children.

717
01:18:15,541 --> 01:18:16,541
If you agree,

718
01:18:17,791 --> 01:18:19,311
I'll book tickets to New York tonight.

719
01:18:20,166 --> 01:18:21,875
Everybody, look this way please.

720
01:18:21,876 --> 01:18:23,500
Look this way, okay.

721
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:24,708
Ready.

722
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,375
One, two, three, smile!

723
01:18:41,375 --> 01:18:42,375
Mr. Wang,

724
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:44,958
it's been a long long time.

725
01:18:45,208 --> 01:18:46,916
It's only yourself this time?

726
01:18:47,458 --> 01:18:48,208
No.

727
01:18:48,209 --> 01:18:50,041
This is my wife, Sherry.

728
01:18:50,666 --> 01:18:51,812
Nice to meet you.

729
01:18:51,813 --> 01:18:52,916
Nice to meet you too.

730
01:18:54,166 --> 01:18:55,291
Well, let's go this way then.

731
01:18:55,291 --> 01:18:56,291
Let's go

732
01:18:59,666 --> 01:19:00,666
What?

733
01:19:03,833 --> 01:19:04,833
Nothing.

734
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
He's awake.

735
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:22,791
He's awake.

736
01:19:23,208 --> 01:19:24,833
He's opening his eyes.

737
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:29,958
Mom, Brother's eyes are gray.

738
01:19:53,916 --> 01:19:54,916
Xiaoxue,

739
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:58,625
I didn't realize doing this would hurt you so much,

740
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:01,750
leading you to leave me forever,

741
01:20:02,583 --> 01:20:03,666
as well as this family.

742
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:07,750
But I never understood

743
01:20:08,833 --> 01:20:11,082
why you'd abandon Chuqi and Chutong.

744
01:20:11,083 --> 01:20:12,083
Dad,

745
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,375
Stop!

746
01:20:19,583 --> 01:20:21,125
But I owe you my gratitude

747
01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:23,750
for giving me such a good son.

748
01:20:25,708 --> 01:20:26,708
At the time,

749
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,250
I viewed Chuqi as my only hope.

750
01:20:30,875 --> 01:20:32,291
He was my everything,

751
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:35,458
But I never imagined,

752
01:20:44,791 --> 01:20:45,791
Xiaoxue,

753
01:20:46,916 --> 01:20:48,708
is this God's punishment?

754
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,041
Made me lose the person I loved the most,

755
01:20:54,666 --> 01:20:56,333
and the person who loves me the most.

756
01:21:21,375 --> 01:21:22,458
Sorry.

757
01:21:37,416 --> 01:21:39,166
If it weren't for me,

758
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:46,208
Wang Chuqi might still be alive.

759
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:48,833
Sorry.

760
01:21:51,708 --> 01:21:52,708
Sorry.

761
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:57,125
I shouldn't have stopped the bus

762
01:21:57,416 --> 01:21:58,541
to tie his shoes.

763
01:21:59,583 --> 01:22:01,187
If I didn't smoke that cigarette,

764
01:22:01,188 --> 01:22:03,875
是不会发生车祸的
there wouldn't have been an accident.

765
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:10,500
With everything that's been said,

766
01:22:11,416 --> 01:22:13,375
Let's just finish this meal

767
01:22:15,291 --> 01:22:16,833
and everybody goes their own way.

768
01:22:17,291 --> 01:22:20,750
Everybody can start a new life.

769
01:22:30,625 --> 01:22:31,833
What are you saying?

770
01:22:32,583 --> 01:22:34,083
Family is forever.

771
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:41,833
This time I'll do better.

772
01:22:45,875 --> 01:22:47,458
I'll be good to your child too.

773
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:54,750
Look,

774
01:22:56,041 --> 01:22:58,833
it's not a coincidence that we've become a family.

775
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:01,375
I give you all my word,

776
01:23:02,333 --> 01:23:03,916
as long as I'm alive,

777
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:06,458
I'll work hard to keep

778
01:23:07,041 --> 01:23:08,500
this family together.

779
01:23:12,625 --> 01:23:13,625
Chutong,

780
01:23:17,916 --> 01:23:18,916
eat.

781
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:24,041
Once this is all over,

782
01:24:25,333 --> 01:24:27,041
let's live together, okay?

783
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:48,458
Sorry for the wait.

784
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:49,500
Sorry for the wait.

785
01:24:51,041 --> 01:24:53,666
Because,
this is a 4-year-old case.

786
01:24:54,958 --> 01:24:56,208
4 years?

787
01:24:58,125 --> 01:24:59,125
3 years.

788
01:25:04,416 --> 01:25:05,776
Officer, can I ask some questions?

789
01:25:06,416 --> 01:25:08,687
His attorney and secretary are in it,

790
01:25:08,688 --> 01:25:10,541
and we still haven't got any clues.

791
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:12,708
Sorry, you can't go in now.

792
01:25:13,166 --> 01:25:15,291
Mr. Wang isn't available for interviews now.

793
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:17,666
I'm the lawyer representing Mr. Wang.

794
01:25:18,125 --> 01:25:19,750
You can talk to me.

795
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:23,333
Mr. Wang,
I know you're badly injured.

796
01:25:23,666 --> 01:25:24,791
But there are a few things

797
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:26,415
I want to ask you.

798
01:25:26,416 --> 01:25:28,583
You're breaking the law.

799
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:29,916
It's alright.

800
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:32,916
Come in.

801
01:25:36,250 --> 01:25:38,166
I knew this day would come eventually.

802
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:45,250
We've started an investigation into your family.

803
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,291
There are a few things I want to ask.

804
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:52,375
Your family's quite unusual.

805
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:57,458
Last night,
we took statements from everybody.

806
01:25:59,083 --> 01:26:01,250
Your ex-wife's daughter, Wang Chutong,

807
01:26:03,583 --> 01:26:06,791
the mother of a victim from that accident, Pan Chen Lu,

808
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:12,125
and your adopted son, Chen Xiaoqi.

809
01:26:17,041 --> 01:26:18,458
我想问你的是hat I want to ask is,

810
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:21,250
Why are you making a home out of nothing?

811
01:26:21,958 --> 01:26:23,041
In this household,

812
01:26:23,625 --> 01:26:26,500
what is Yu Kunqiao's role?

813
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,957
A breakthrough has occurred in the investigation of the

814
01:26:31,958 --> 01:26:33,166
recent Shihe International School bus incident.

815
01:26:33,166 --> 01:26:36,208
After extensive evidence gathering by police, the truck
driver, Mr. Xu, has been found responsible for the accident.

816
01:26:36,209 --> 01:26:39,187
Speeding and fatigue were likely factors in his death.

817
01:26:39,188 --> 01:26:42,165
The suspect, Mr. Yu, Shihe International School's bus driver,

818
01:26:42,166 --> 01:26:44,416
after investigation, has been found not directly liable.

819
01:26:44,417 --> 01:26:46,500
He was acquitted in the initial trial.

820
01:27:10,125 --> 01:27:11,250
Want some?

821
01:27:44,041 --> 01:27:45,041
Mr. Wang,

822
01:27:47,041 --> 01:27:48,791
can we exchange phone numbers?

823
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:02,500
This is mine.

824
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:07,708
Mr. Wang, time is up.

825
01:28:18,166 --> 01:28:21,416
She's the mistress of the head of Panshi Enterprises,

826
01:28:22,291 --> 01:28:23,458
best to keep your distance.

827
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:25,208
What happened?

828
01:28:25,209 --> 01:28:28,062
She was dependent on alimony payments to get by.

829
01:28:28,063 --> 01:28:29,354
Now that her child is gone,

830
01:28:29,355 --> 01:28:31,166
she won't receive another dime from alimony.

831
01:28:31,333 --> 01:28:34,041
So she's rushing to find somebody new.

832
01:28:34,416 --> 01:28:37,166
We went through the same thing,

833
01:28:37,333 --> 01:28:39,291
so it was natural for us to be together.

834
01:28:40,083 --> 01:28:41,916
Then, how do you explain Chen Xiaoqi?

835
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:46,708
Mr. Wang,
I I'm You're Chen Xiaoqi's father.

836
01:28:46,709 --> 01:28:47,832
Yes.

837
01:28:47,833 --> 01:28:49,208
What is it?

838
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,333
Wait outside the car for me.

839
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Let's speak inside.

840
01:28:54,416 --> 01:28:55,416
Okay.

841
01:28:57,375 --> 01:28:58,666
If you back out now,

842
01:29:00,791 --> 01:29:02,208
I worry the other parents

843
01:29:03,458 --> 01:29:05,833
will say it's not because of financial reasons,

844
01:29:08,083 --> 01:29:09,500
but because

845
01:29:10,041 --> 01:29:11,458
Chen Xiaoqi,

846
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:15,124
after all, did survive.

847
01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:16,624
How can you say that?

848
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:18,750
Of course I'm the same as the other parents.

849
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,958
I want to fight this case to the end.

850
01:29:22,166 --> 01:29:23,833
Even though Xiaoqi survived,

851
01:29:25,458 --> 01:29:27,541
he's disabled for life.

852
01:29:28,041 --> 01:29:29,666
Though we own a factory,

853
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,165
business hasn't been good for a long time.

854
01:29:33,166 --> 01:29:34,583
I worry in the end,

855
01:29:35,416 --> 01:29:37,625
even if we sell it to treat his leg,

856
01:29:38,166 --> 01:29:39,500
the money won't be enough.

857
01:29:39,501 --> 01:29:41,458
Backing out is your decision,

858
01:29:42,125 --> 01:29:44,041
but the school's paid you compensation.

859
01:29:44,458 --> 01:29:45,458
What people will say,

860
01:29:46,125 --> 01:29:47,646
you must have some idea.

861
01:29:47,647 --> 01:29:49,208
How is that possibly enough?

862
01:29:49,833 --> 01:29:51,749
His mother died young.

863
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:53,707
At least he's a good student

864
01:29:53,708 --> 01:29:55,291
and just tested into Shihe.

865
01:29:57,208 --> 01:29:59,291
But I never imagined this would happen.

866
01:30:00,166 --> 01:30:01,583
I managed to get remarried,

867
01:30:02,083 --> 01:30:03,583
and my wife just had a baby.

868
01:30:04,125 --> 01:30:06,958
Now all my money is going towards this lawsuit and medical treatments.

869
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:09,708
My wife and I fight about this every day.

870
01:30:09,916 --> 01:30:12,333
Also,
there are even people who say

871
01:30:14,166 --> 01:30:16,750
that Xiaoqi called the driver out of the bus,

872
01:30:16,751 --> 01:30:18,875
and that he's culpable.

873
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:22,916
Only you, Mr. Wang,
have never brought this up.

874
01:30:23,375 --> 01:30:24,875
You're the most reasonable.

875
01:30:26,583 --> 01:30:27,625
Mr. Wang,

876
01:30:28,958 --> 01:30:30,500
you must understand.

877
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:36,125
I wanted to help their family,

878
01:30:36,666 --> 01:30:37,875
so I adopted him.

879
01:30:41,375 --> 01:30:43,958
Even if I could understand your desire to help,

880
01:30:45,083 --> 01:30:46,375
but I want to know,

881
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,708
why would you change his name to

882
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,250
Wang Chuqi?

883
01:30:55,708 --> 01:30:56,937
Don't worry, Mr. Wang.

884
01:30:56,938 --> 01:30:59,000
I'll prepare materials for another appeal.

885
01:30:59,001 --> 01:31:00,874
We won't give up.

886
01:31:00,875 --> 01:31:02,208
There are lots of reporters outside,

887
01:31:02,209 --> 01:31:03,583
should we dodge them?

888
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:04,458
No need.

889
01:31:04,791 --> 01:31:05,832
Mr. Wang,

890
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:07,749
can you answer a few questions Mr. Wang?

891
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:10,583
The second ruling has come out for Shihe International Schools' bus driver.

892
01:31:10,584 --> 01:31:12,665
The driver, Yu Kunqiao, was found not guilty.

893
01:31:12,666 --> 01:31:13,708
Some parents have threatened,

894
01:31:13,709 --> 01:31:15,229
that even if he's found not guilty,

895
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:16,562
they won't let him off.

896
01:31:16,563 --> 01:31:18,166
Can I ask if this is true?

897
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:21,250
I've never heard of such a thing.

898
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:30,562
I believe the law is just.

899
01:31:30,563 --> 01:31:32,583
But the court has ruled twice against you.

900
01:31:33,875 --> 01:31:36,916
So we are continuing to appeal.

901
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:38,582
Mr. Wang, are you sure?

902
01:31:38,583 --> 01:31:39,583
到了三审
For a third trial,

903
01:31:39,584 --> 01:31:41,833
the chances of overturning are slim to none.

904
01:31:43,291 --> 01:31:44,666
Even if we lose the third trial,

905
01:31:46,208 --> 01:31:47,791
for Yu Kunqiao,

906
01:31:48,458 --> 01:31:50,166
he has no escape from moral condemnation.

907
01:31:51,208 --> 01:31:54,687
But so far, online opinion has been sympathetic to the bus driver.

908
01:31:54,688 --> 01:31:57,958
They say it's incessant bullying by students that caused the tragedy.

909
01:31:58,208 --> 01:31:59,208
What do you think?

910
01:32:00,708 --> 01:32:01,708
I don't know about this.

911
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:04,166
Let me ask a different way.

912
01:32:04,375 --> 01:32:05,646
This school bus accident,

913
01:32:05,647 --> 01:32:08,854
the victims' families have brought in an all-star team of lawyers

914
01:32:08,855 --> 01:32:11,396
determined to prosecute the school and the driver.

915
01:32:11,397 --> 01:32:14,187
Yet, after spending so much time and social resources,

916
01:32:14,188 --> 01:32:16,312
the driver has still been acquitted.

917
01:32:16,313 --> 01:32:17,750
Is it fair to say that

918
01:32:18,208 --> 01:32:21,000
money and status can't overcome everything?

919
01:32:28,708 --> 01:32:29,875
Are you a family member?

920
01:32:31,666 --> 01:32:32,250
Hm.

921
01:32:32,666 --> 01:32:34,186
Finally, somebody's come to visit him.

922
01:32:34,708 --> 01:32:35,958
Don't worry,

923
01:32:36,208 --> 01:32:37,375
it's not life threatening.

924
01:32:37,666 --> 01:32:39,458
He's suffered a brain contusion

925
01:32:39,916 --> 01:32:41,541
so he's been in a coma.

926
01:32:42,166 --> 01:32:44,207
But he's stable,

927
01:32:44,208 --> 01:32:45,583
he'll likely regain consciousness.

928
01:32:48,833 --> 01:32:52,666
But then,
he may have some temporary amnesia,

929
01:32:53,333 --> 01:32:56,083
but with good care, he should gradually recover.

930
01:32:58,375 --> 01:33:00,479
By the way, since you're family,

931
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,125
remember to take care of his paperwork.

932
01:33:03,833 --> 01:33:04,833
Mr. Wang,

933
01:33:04,834 --> 01:33:07,750
can you tell us about everybody's current mindset?

934
01:33:10,458 --> 01:33:11,625
Our mindset,

935
01:33:15,541 --> 01:33:17,166
the mindset of every parent,

936
01:33:18,541 --> 01:33:21,000
the feeling of losing one's own flesh and blood is the same.

937
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:27,083
We all believe that the law

938
01:33:27,916 --> 01:33:29,708
will protect the good and punish the evil.

939
01:33:32,583 --> 01:33:33,916
But it's not always the case.

940
01:33:37,291 --> 01:33:38,291
This time,

941
01:33:40,666 --> 01:33:42,333
Dad needs your help.

942
01:33:43,125 --> 01:33:46,416
I'll pay the attorney fees for the Chen family's appeal.

943
01:33:46,791 --> 01:33:49,291
I'll pay off the debts of the Chen factory in full.

944
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,750
The additional money and conditions Mr. Chen requested,

945
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:00,416
I agree in full.

946
01:34:01,208 --> 01:34:02,521
If the child agrees,

947
01:34:02,522 --> 01:34:05,166
restrict visits to a minimum in the first few years.

948
01:34:06,458 --> 01:34:07,499
I only hope

949
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:10,125
the adoption papers can be ready in a day or two,

950
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:17,291
and that he can adopt my surname.

951
01:34:28,041 --> 01:34:29,249
Reservation under Mr. Wang.

952
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:30,250
One second.

953
01:34:42,791 --> 01:34:43,791
Yes,

954
01:34:45,458 --> 01:34:46,708
I'll get back to you.

955
01:34:50,666 --> 01:34:52,661
Excuse me for calling
you so suddenly.

956
01:34:57,041 --> 01:34:58,041
Waiter.

957
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:18,583
Sorry, I'm not feeling well.

958
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:24,000
I'm sorry, I must go.

959
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:31,410
I want to ask you a question.

960
01:35:31,958 --> 01:35:32,958
Perhaps I'm overstepping,

961
01:35:36,166 --> 01:35:37,333
would you like to continue

962
01:35:37,708 --> 01:35:38,833
being a mother?

963
01:35:48,916 --> 01:35:51,083
Here are the two we cast for Si An's parents.

964
01:35:51,416 --> 01:35:53,541
They're small-time actors from local troupes.

965
01:35:53,833 --> 01:35:55,375
No filmography whatsoever.

966
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:58,708
I've settled the contract terms with them.

967
01:35:59,833 --> 01:36:01,958
It includes confidentiality agreements

968
01:36:01,959 --> 01:36:05,208
and a lifelong renunciation of acting.

969
01:36:06,583 --> 01:36:07,541
Mr. Wang,

970
01:36:07,542 --> 01:36:10,583
his blood pressure and oxygen saturation have normalized.

971
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:13,583
According to the doctor, he'll likely wake up soon.

972
01:36:13,584 --> 01:36:15,708
Can we know when?

973
01:36:16,416 --> 01:36:17,708
It's unclear.

974
01:36:18,291 --> 01:36:19,957
Give me more time,

975
01:36:19,958 --> 01:36:21,375
I should be able to predict it.

976
01:36:48,541 --> 01:36:49,541
Here am I?

977
01:36:52,333 --> 01:36:53,458
This is my home.

978
01:36:56,458 --> 01:36:57,333
Who is it?

979
01:36:57,334 --> 01:36:58,416
Parents of Si An,

980
01:36:59,791 --> 01:37:00,874
a student.

981
01:37:00,875 --> 01:37:02,250
And we families work together,

982
01:37:02,666 --> 01:37:04,250
we can make him disappear.

983
01:37:05,333 --> 01:37:07,791
-I'm calling the police.
-I can't leave,they'll kill me.

984
01:37:09,083 --> 01:37:10,750
Please let me hide.

985
01:37:14,541 --> 01:37:15,833
Why do this?

986
01:37:16,750 --> 01:37:18,958
I don't intend to trap him forever.

987
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:21,791
I just want him to face his wrongdoings.

988
01:37:22,416 --> 01:37:24,729
As soon as Yu Kunqiao discovers his conscience

989
01:37:24,730 --> 01:37:25,791
and turns himself in,

990
01:37:26,166 --> 01:37:27,208
he'll realize

991
01:37:27,958 --> 01:37:30,166
The courts have already found him not guilty,

992
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:32,041
he's free.

993
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:39,000
And I also promise,

994
01:37:39,708 --> 01:37:42,000
I'll then let this family disband.

995
01:38:00,833 --> 01:38:02,791
Would you get some fresh air with me?

996
01:38:10,708 --> 01:38:11,708
Mr. Wang,

997
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:15,083
I'm still curious.

998
01:38:15,458 --> 01:38:16,812
Although Yu Kunqiao claims

999
01:38:16,813 --> 01:38:19,458
that you've never restricted his personal freedom,

1000
01:38:19,958 --> 01:38:20,958
but you,

1001
01:38:21,416 --> 01:38:23,125
did the thought of

1002
01:38:24,541 --> 01:38:27,333
illegally imprisoning him ever cross your mind?

1003
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:42,791
It's me.

1004
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:52,500
Okay.

1005
01:39:02,541 --> 01:39:03,541
Mr. Wang,

1006
01:39:06,166 --> 01:39:07,333
Yu Kunqiao has decided

1007
01:39:08,041 --> 01:39:09,361
not to press charges against you.

1008
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:12,583
He said he's grateful to you for treating him like family.

1009
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:15,708
But you still have some legal liabilities.

1010
01:39:16,750 --> 01:39:19,208
We will notify you about your court date.

1011
01:39:35,583 --> 01:39:36,625
Mr. Yu,

1012
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:39,750
Mr. Yu,

1013
01:39:42,083 --> 01:39:44,000
you're not criminally liable.

1014
01:39:46,333 --> 01:39:47,750
Since you're not bringing charges,

1015
01:39:48,125 --> 01:39:49,291
you can go home.

1016
01:40:41,583 --> 01:40:43,041
I still need more time.

1017
01:41:35,458 --> 01:41:37,229
I finished learning last time's song.

1018
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:38,500
I want to play it for you.

1019
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:56,250
Brother,

1020
01:43:56,958 --> 01:43:58,916
I keep thinking, what is a home?

1021
01:44:00,125 --> 01:44:03,458
Home should be a shelter that can protect us.

1022
01:44:04,125 --> 01:44:05,916
Now that I've experienced so much,

1023
01:44:06,083 --> 01:44:08,500
I feel that we can protect our home too.

1024
01:44:09,625 --> 01:44:12,333
The last generation's mistakes don't have to be our burdens.

1025
01:44:13,291 --> 01:44:14,666
If it's okay,

1026
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:16,916
I'd like us to still be family.

1027
01:44:18,666 --> 01:44:19,666
Let's

1028
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,375
start anew.
