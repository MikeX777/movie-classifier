1
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,763
- I still remember my days in Aberystwyth.

2
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,090
Many many years ago I
graduated from the oldest

3
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,570
university in Wales and
home to the oldest school

4
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,970
of international politics in the world.

5
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,880
I'm really glad that
Aberystwyth is able to

6
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,970
host this grand award ceremony today...

7
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,110
But of course, you might
say as a politician,

8
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,460
I would naturally endorse my
alma mater that might be true,

9
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,030
but for me, I will always
support what is right and good.

10
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,523
Thank you very much.

11
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,720
- Okay, and now for our final recipient.

12
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,070
This lady, this amazing lady

13
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,633
has selflessly served our community.

14
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,080
She's one of our leading
specialists here in the hospital.

15
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,700
She's worked tirelessly to raise funds

16
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,750
for children's cancer
research and treatment

17
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,780
but in addition to that,

18
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,860
she's provided support
for teenage pregnancies

19
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,440
and many of our local families
have benefited directly

20
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,080
from her work, and let's
face it, who can forget

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,343
how she led us on that London marathon?

22
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,730
Yeah, that was so much fun.

23
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,800
Okay, we must recognize the brilliant work

24
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,460
of this amazing lady.

25
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,146
Please welcome Dr. Zara
from St. Luke's Hospital.

26
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:27,534
- Thank you so much, thank you, thank you.

27
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:29,840
Wow.

28
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,903
Wow, it's amazing.

29
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,540
I am so honored to be
receiving this award, really.

30
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,550
Because I remember relocating
from Los Angeles five years

31
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,690
ago with my mom to this
amazing town and my friends

32
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,640
thought I was going to the
end of the world and truly

33
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,150
the train line literarily terminates here,

34
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,930
I must say, but I've got say, it's been

35
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,350
one of the best decisions
of my life, and I would like

36
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,700
to dedicate this award
it to all the amazing

37
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,340
kids we've worked with over
the years and to their families

38
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,850
for making our job so much easier.

39
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,180
And to all the medical
doctors from St. Luke's,

40
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,010
seated in the audience
today, who have also worked

41
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:12,950
with me on these projects.

42
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,564
I want to say thank you and God bless.

43
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:17,573
Thank you.

44
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:24,224
More drinks, Alex!

45
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,810
- Okay, here we go again.

46
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,145
To the smartest doctor.

47
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,264
- I'm so sorry, but it's
not safe for you to go home.

48
00:03:54,264 --> 00:03:56,210
You need to stay here.

49
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,313
- Good morning Mrs. Jones?

50
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,350
Okay, so take a deep breath, good?

51
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,240
We just want to keep you
under observation, for a few

52
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,400
more days, run some
test and if you're good,

53
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,340
we'll send you home.

54
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,460
Is that okay?

55
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,910
All right, so nurse, take
her back to the ward.

56
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,940
- Doctor Zara, a woman
in labor was just rushed

57
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,010
into the emergency room.

58
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:25,843
- Oh, really?

59
00:04:25,843 --> 00:04:26,676
How long has she been there?

60
00:04:26,676 --> 00:04:27,913
- Not that long.
- Okay.

61
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:07,145
- We are here for your daughter,

62
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:09,036
What is your...

63
00:05:09,036 --> 00:05:09,910
- I'm listening, I'm listening.

64
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,870
- Yeah, what is the problem that you're

65
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,970
dragging your feet about?

66
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,253
- Alhaji, I am not dragging my feet,

67
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,360
most especially now that
Halima is 13 years old.

68
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,940
I know she is big enough to
be in her husband's house

69
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,310
but you people have to exercise

70
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,550
a little more patience for me--

71
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,667
- Ibrahim, have you changed your mind?

72
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,790
Are you not giving me your
daughter in marriage again?

73
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,900
- I have not change my
mind, Sani, but you know

74
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,025
there are necessary things
that Halima needs to go

75
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:45,580
to her husband's house with, those are the

76
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,527
things I am trying to fix.

77
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,983
- Fix the date,

78
00:05:51,295 --> 00:05:53,253
I will take care of all the expenses.

79
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,177
Halima.

80
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:55,344
Ma!

81
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,492
- What did Mama Adamu say?

82
00:05:58,492 --> 00:05:59,600
- She said...

83
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,257
- Mr. Bird now came to the
ground and say, "Mrs. Tortoise,

84
00:06:02,257 --> 00:06:04,257
"your husband say you
put all the hard things

85
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:07,080
"in the house, that he's
going to fall on them, oh!"

86
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,310
So she did, the tortoise
now come to the ground.

87
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:16,029
That is how the tortoise broke his back.

88
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,660
- Halima, what are you
doing here all alone?

89
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,990
Why are you not with
your brother and sister?

90
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,597
You should come in and rest.

91
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:36,409
You know next week is your big day.

92
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:39,880
- Ma, I don't want to marry now.

93
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,000
- Halima, you are too young
to understand these things.

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,160
You are young and this is the right time.

95
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,290
When you are old and worn
out, who will marry you?

96
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,700
And Sani has been so generous.

97
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,730
See all the gifts he showers
on the us every now and then?

98
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,530
It seems he's the right one for you.

99
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,577
- Why me?

100
00:06:59,577 --> 00:07:02,204
I don't want go with him.

101
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:05,600
- Halima, your father
wants the best for you.

102
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,660
Since you're the eldest, he
wants you to get married first,

103
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,453
before your younger one, Tani.

104
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,600
She has been betrothed over a year now.

105
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,250
She is waiting for you to get
married so hers can come next.

106
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,003
Can't you see how excited she is?

107
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,023
- Mother, please.

108
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,600
- Halima, you are very young and healthy

109
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,370
and very soon you will become a mother.

110
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,337
See my Halima, getting
married to a very rich man!

111
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,003
Your friends and their mother
will be so jealous of you!

112
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,670
- It's been three months
since our last session.

113
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,070
- Is it already three months?

114
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,440
- Yes, where have you been?

115
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,530
- I had to take care of my mom.

116
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,063
- What happened to your mother?

117
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,150
- She's been suffering from
exhaustion from her last trip

118
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,810
and now I can't believe she's planning

119
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,300
another trip to Africa.

120
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,760
- You know that's what keeps her going?

121
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,700
- Yes, but she's been doing it for years.

122
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,170
Traveling every year for
her medical missions.

123
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,870
- One of those missions saved you.

124
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,553
- I know.

125
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,693
Maybe I just miss when it
was just the two of us.

126
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,400
- You feel she's not proud of you anymore?

127
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,233
- No,

128
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,273
she is.

129
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,724
- Do you think you might go with her

130
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:27,124
on one of her trips someday?

131
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:30,802
- I don't know.

132
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:31,635
- Why don't you go?

133
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:34,133
- Because told you before my life is here.

134
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,570
- When do we break this wall?

135
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,403
- What wall?

136
00:08:39,403 --> 00:08:41,340
- Your fears?
- I don't have any fears.

137
00:08:42,637 --> 00:08:45,860
- We have been going around
in circles each session.

138
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,003
When do you let me in?

139
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,550
- Maybe I need to trust completely.

140
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,910
- You don't trust me?

141
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,743
- I, it--

142
00:08:58,875 --> 00:08:59,708
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,975
Hospital.

144
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,393
I have to leave now.

145
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,130
- Your next appointment is on Thursday.

146
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,487
- Okay, thank you.

147
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,100
- Thousands of women are
dying in Africa due to

148
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,720
the lack of medical care
and this is a serious

149
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,760
gynecological problem.

150
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,140
It was reported that more
than two million women

151
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,970
in the world suffer from
a condition called fistula

152
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,860
and one would have thought
in this 21st century,

153
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,333
that cases of fistula should not exist.

154
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,400
- You asked to see me?

155
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,996
- Oh yeah, have a seat.

156
00:09:35,996 --> 00:09:38,244
I have an interesting proposition for you.

157
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,807
- It's not about going back
to Sierra Leone, is it?

158
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:41,550
- Oh, come on, I thought you liked it.

159
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,980
- I do, I do, but I got
back home two weeks ago

160
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,090
and Jamie was walking, you
know little toddler steps,

161
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,923
and I missed it.

162
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,400
I need a break.

163
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,350
- How old is Jamie?

164
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,713
- He's 14 months.

165
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,600
Why don't you ask Zara?

166
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,320
Sound like the Pharmco guys
gave a good presentation.

167
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,800
- Oh boy, did they ever, and
we can't possibly miss out

168
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,790
on the funds they can
make available to us.

169
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,120
- You should really ask Zara.

170
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,340
She does so much charity work here.

171
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,480
It's almost as if she's trying
to make up for something.

172
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,770
- Yeah.

173
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,240
It's funny, you know, she
gives her hundred percent,

174
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,604
but when you bring up Africa,
she shies away from it.

175
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:16,230
I don't know, beats me.

176
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,470
- Well, the fact that I'm
from there doesn't necessarily

177
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,570
mean that I know it more than anyone here.

178
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,247
- Okay Zara,

179
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,690
Pharmco Pharmaceutical is
investing over sixty percent

180
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,790
in our community hospital fund.

181
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,453
It's only fair that we reciprocate.

182
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,795
Don't you want to be a part of the team?

183
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:33,820
- I'm already part of the team!

184
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,910
I don't need to go to
Africa with a company whose

185
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,680
only interest is in making
profit all in the name of

186
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,380
charity, and I don't need
to prove anything to anyone.

187
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,472
- I want you to think about this.

188
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,400
- How was your meeting with Dr. Brown?

189
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,930
- He wants me to go to Africa
with Pharmco Pharmaceutical.

190
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,140
Can you imagine that?

191
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,340
- That sounds great!

192
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,620
- Great?
- Yeah.

193
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,970
Maybe we could go together.

194
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,220
- I don't even want to talk about that.

195
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,483
I'm not going there.

196
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,400
- Why?

197
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,233
What's wrong with that?

198
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,140
- Come on Alex, Dr. Brown
just wants to look good

199
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,530
in front of the board.

200
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,350
That's Dr. Brown.

201
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,183
You know?

202
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,230
- I wonder why he hasn't ask me?

203
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,900
- Maybe you should got ask him also.

204
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,517
I told him to, you know...

205
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,330
Just sit tight
for a couple of minutes.

206
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,840
It's nearly ready.

207
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,160
- Yeah, I told him to ask doctor...

208
00:11:35,867 --> 00:11:37,420
All right, it'll
be just two more minutes,

209
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,085
nearly there.

210
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:44,085
- Um...

211
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,820
Uh, Mom?

212
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,000
Yeah?

213
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,093
Um, yes,

214
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:51,973
are you okay?

215
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,090
Yes, you want me to come?

216
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,530
Okay, I'll be there now.

217
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,590
Alex, my mom, I need to go to my mom now.

218
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,571
I need to leave.

219
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:02,220
- What?

220
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,053
Zara?

221
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,870
- Hi darling.

222
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,426
- He's gotten a ring

223
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:21,420
- Who?
- Alex!

224
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,253
- Oh, show me!

225
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,090
- Well, I freaked out and I left.

226
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,240
- So he didn't ask you?

227
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,060
- Well he was about to.

228
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,590
The whole candle lit dinner,
the whole atmosphere.

229
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,070
I just freaked out.

230
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,730
I'm not ready.

231
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,563
- Come here.

232
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,810
It's natural to be afraid.

233
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,770
But Alex is a good man.

234
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,603
- I know.

235
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,070
Maybe I'm not just good enough.

236
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,450
- Look, I've always told you,

237
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,510
don't judge yourself so harshly.

238
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,753
You are beautiful, successful,

239
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:57,940
you're one of the best
doctors in the town.

240
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,403
Why on earth would you think
you're not good enough?

241
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:02,236
- I don't know.

242
00:13:02,236 --> 00:13:04,403
Maybe I've gotten nervous.

243
00:13:06,547 --> 00:13:08,500
Are you still planning
your trip to Africa?

244
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,649
- Yes, I am.

245
00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:10,513
Are you going to come with me this time?

246
00:13:10,513 --> 00:13:12,060
It will be fun.

247
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,620
- Mom, I've told you, I'm needed here.

248
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,710
- Wow, great!

249
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,687
She's almost due for delivery.

250
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:18,610
- We are really looking forward to it.

251
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,593
We're so excited.

252
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:25,510
- Um, however, from what I'm seeing here,

253
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,340
her pelvic is too narrow
for a natural birth,

254
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,948
so she might need to deliver
through Caesarean section.

255
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:34,951
- No, no, no, no, no, we
expected natural birth.

256
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:36,982
- I know, we have to consider the risk.

257
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,156
I mean, Caesarean section is not--

258
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:39,280
- No, no, no, we have read lots

259
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,692
of self help books on natural birth

260
00:13:40,692 --> 00:13:42,642
and we are convinced it's right for us.

261
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:46,943
- Are you her husband?

262
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,003
- She is my fiancee.

263
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,900
- What do you think?

264
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,960
I mean, it's your body.

265
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,630
I'm here to lay down all the medical facts

266
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,453
for you to help you make a decision.

267
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,020
- Em, well, I would
prefer a natural birth.

268
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,400
- I know, we are not in anyway
discouraging natural birth.

269
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,170
I mean it's the best way, but if we sense

270
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,940
any kind of possible
complications, you know,

271
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,317
we take precaution so that
mother and child are not at risk.

272
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,250
- Now don't try to scare us.

273
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,750
We want natural birth, doctor,

274
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,500
and that's what we've decided on.

275
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,610
- I couldn't believe those
two, acting as if I suggested

276
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,093
the worst option to them.

277
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,880
- We advise and the patients decides.

278
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,720
- Well they're even
lucky to have a choice.

279
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,000
Some people don't.

280
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,770
I didn't have a choice.

281
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,348
It was very painful.

282
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,190
- What was painful?

283
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,973
- Leaving her or the
thought of not knowing.

284
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,903
- Do you have any regrets?

285
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,670
- I can't let go of
the pain, of the shame.

286
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,420
- Why do you come here every Thursday?

287
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,273
- I don't know.

288
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,930
I guess I'm supposed to
be talking to a shrink.

289
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,483
- Are you willing to look
inside yourself and heal?

290
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,413
- Welcome, yes.

291
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,503
- I need more.

292
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,900
- How is my beautiful daughter doing?

293
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,310
- We are almost done.

294
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,970
My magic fingers are giving
her the best make-over

295
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,790
this town has ever experienced.

296
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,700
Look at her, like a princess!

297
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,586
Even the old Sani will not recognize her.

298
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:10,540
- Ah, Dillaliya, Sani is a
nice one, and I know he's going

299
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,680
to take good care of my Halima.

300
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,250
- Oh, I'm sure, his other
wives seem to be doing okay.

301
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,260
Though I heard his mother is a handful,

302
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,910
giving his wives so much trouble.

303
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,630
- Dillaliya, his mother is
a good woman, and I know

304
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,313
she's going to be fine with them.

305
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,620
- Oh please, ignore the way I'm talking.

306
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,980
It's just everyone seems to
think I have a big mouth,

307
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,070
but Halima is so beautiful--

308
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,170
- I think your job is
done, right, Dillaliya?

309
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,683
- Yes, yes.

310
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,290
- My daughter, all your
friends are going to be jealous

311
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,350
of you because you're
marrying a rich husband.

312
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,710
And even those who cannot find husbands

313
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,161
for their own daughters.

314
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:53,664
Cheer up, my dear.

315
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:55,047
Cheer up.

316
00:16:55,903 --> 00:17:00,841
Hadiza!

317
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:32,038
- Now here is the dowry.

318
00:17:49,124 --> 00:17:50,541
- It is complete,

319
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:55,071
may God bless this marriage.

320
00:18:48,197 --> 00:18:50,691
- Ah, doctor, I can't take it anymore!

321
00:18:52,773 --> 00:18:55,680
- I don't want you to
push unless I tell you to.

322
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,780
I want you to save all your energy, okay?

323
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,613
- Shut up!

324
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,648
Doctor, I can't take it anymore.

325
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:03,860
- I'm here, baby.

326
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,742
- Don't call me baby!

327
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:07,713
Take him out, take him out, take him out!

328
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,546
- Please, I need you to leave now.

329
00:19:11,595 --> 00:19:13,620
Let's move her now to the theater, please.

330
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,121
- Cut me open, I don't care.

331
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:18,788
Get it out of me!

332
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,922
Thank you doctor, I'm really grateful.

333
00:19:27,922 --> 00:19:29,440
- No problem.

334
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,343
- And uh, I'm so sorry, doctor.

335
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,620
I'm glad you did the operation.

336
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,340
- It's all right, there's no problem.

337
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,457
The most important thing is
that mother and child are safe.

338
00:19:39,457 --> 00:19:40,431
How're you feeling?

339
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:43,500
- A bit tired, but I'm okay.

340
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,750
- Oh, Mom.

341
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,840
- Oh, hi darling.
- Hi.

342
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,560
- I didn't want to leave
without seeing you.

343
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,060
- I didn't know you were coming in today.

344
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,740
- My trip has been moved forward,

345
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,163
so I needed to do my final check ups.

346
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,103
- Oh, okay.

347
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,540
- Are you okay, darling?

348
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,570
- I'm fine.

349
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,050
When are you leaving?

350
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,811
- In a week.
- Okay, I--

351
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:05,853
The test results.

352
00:20:05,853 --> 00:20:06,686
- Oh, thanks.

353
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:09,780
Here's your results, Mama.

354
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,140
Okay, mom, you are good to go.

355
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,990
Clean and healthy.

356
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,650
- I need to be on my way.

357
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,423
- I was exactly like you when
I married my first husband.

358
00:20:21,423 --> 00:20:23,370
That was before he died.

359
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,260
Poor man, he had a fragile heart!

360
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,560
But after then, I married
my second husband,

361
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,547
which is Sani's father,
Sani, your husband, eh?

362
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,810
Sani's father loved me.

363
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:39,320
He could not get his hands
off me, but after a while

364
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,770
he too died, he too had
a fragile heart.

365
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,110
But don't worry.

366
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,140
You see, I like you.

367
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,070
You are very strong.

368
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,117
Look at your bones, you'll give
me a lot of grand children.

369
00:20:51,117 --> 00:20:51,991
Hm?

370
00:20:51,991 --> 00:20:53,869
- You stubborn boy.

371
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:55,424
What is wrong with you,
what is wrong with you?

372
00:20:55,424 --> 00:20:56,257
What is wrong with you?

373
00:20:56,257 --> 00:20:58,170
- Hey, woman, stop beating him!

374
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,300
- Halimagida, this boy is very stubborn!

375
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,240
- Is okay, is okay.

376
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,503
Go, go, go to your brothers.

377
00:21:03,503 --> 00:21:05,440
Hey, hey, afternoon.

378
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,399
Where's my mother?

379
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,463
- She's over there.

380
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:10,290
- What about my new wife, Halima?

381
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,123
Where is she?

382
00:21:11,123 --> 00:21:13,007
- She's equally there, she's with Hajia.

383
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:14,143
- Ah! Halima!

384
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,213
Halima!

385
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,133
Ah, good afternoon, Ma!

386
00:21:21,426 --> 00:21:22,259
Halima!

387
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:24,500
- I was just having a little
discussion with your new wife.

388
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,886
What a beautiful addition she is.

389
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,333
- Halima, my wife, how are you?

390
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,650
Let's go in, let's go in, my wife.

391
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,860
Halima, my wife.

392
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:51,890
My pretty one, this is
for you, as my new wife.

393
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:57,637
I want you to always look
nice and beautiful for me, hm?

394
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,563
You are welcome.

395
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,420
- Is there something you
need to talk to me about?

396
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,963
- No, why?

397
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,970
- Just wondering.

398
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,563
- I'm just remembering my dad.

399
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,593
And I miss him so much.

400
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,907
- You know, I'm here for you.

401
00:23:08,907 --> 00:23:13,907
- Yeah, I know.

402
00:23:17,245 --> 00:23:18,078
- Halima.

403
00:23:27,044 --> 00:23:28,211
My pretty one.

404
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,980
You know you are mine now, eh?

405
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,470
Don't do that.

406
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,284
Come close to your husband.

407
00:23:35,284 --> 00:23:36,735
Come!
- Don't hurt me.

408
00:23:36,735 --> 00:23:38,091
- Hey, shh!

409
00:23:38,091 --> 00:23:39,770
I'm not going to hurt you.

410
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,613
Come, come, come to me!

411
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,294
Hey, hey, hey--

412
00:23:45,353 --> 00:23:46,340
Listen, listen to me!

413
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,173
Listen!

414
00:23:47,173 --> 00:23:48,870
Keep quiet, shut up!

415
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:52,263
I paid a lot of money
to have you as my wife!

416
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,847
I waited for you all these years,

417
00:23:55,847 --> 00:23:58,700
but still you want to struggle with me.

418
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,916
Stop it, stop it, I said!

419
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,473
Did your mother not prepare
you for the role of a wife?

420
00:24:31,994 --> 00:24:34,773
Do not be stubborn with me, you hear me?

421
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:38,953
When I come here next time,
I expect complete submission!

422
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:55,910
Halima!

423
00:24:56,752 --> 00:24:58,422
- I think this one is okay.

424
00:24:58,422 --> 00:24:59,255
- Eh.

425
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,573
- Halima.

426
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,100
What is wrong with you?

427
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,403
Why haven't you bothered to join

428
00:25:11,403 --> 00:25:13,433
the rest of us to do some cleaning?

429
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,720
Why are you locked up in here?

430
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,070
Come, let me clean you up.

431
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,810
- He beats me, all my body is paining me.

432
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,713
I don't want to see him again.

433
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,733
- Sorry, he didn't beat you.

434
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,210
I'm sure that's his own way to show you

435
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,550
how much he loves you.

436
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,087
- I don't want to see him again.

437
00:25:40,087 --> 00:25:42,153
I don't want to see him again.

438
00:25:42,153 --> 00:25:43,830
- It's okay, Halima.

439
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,987
You are young, but you will
understand soon enough.

440
00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:51,991
- Stop, uncle, please.

441
00:25:54,998 --> 00:25:55,831
No, no!

442
00:25:57,786 --> 00:25:59,703
Uncle stop, uncle stop.

443
00:26:16,265 --> 00:26:17,932
- Thank you so much.

444
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,442
- That's him, right?

445
00:26:30,442 --> 00:26:31,810
- Alex!

446
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,000
What are you doing here?

447
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,650
- You're cheating on me with him?

448
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,257
- Have you been following me
and what are you talking about?

449
00:26:38,257 --> 00:26:40,010
- I'm talking about you
sneaking out every Thursday

450
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,390
to see another man.

451
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,223
I trusted you, Zara.

452
00:26:42,223 --> 00:26:44,410
- No, I trusted you not
to invade my privacy.

453
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,440
- Your privacy?

454
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,460
Are we private now?

455
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,840
- Listen Alex, I'm not going

456
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,030
to take this crap from you or any man.

457
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,550
I need to sort myself out.

458
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,330
- Oh, so that's what you are
doing, sorting yourself out?

459
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,520
- You're damn right,
that's what I'm doing,

460
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,530
sorting myself out.

461
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,363
What is this?

462
00:26:58,363 --> 00:26:59,270
You sneaking up on me?

463
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,540
I mean, that is so creepy.

464
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,650
I'm done

465
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,070
- Zara come back here.

466
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,413
Zara, I'm talking to you!

467
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:16,580
- Where are you coming from?

468
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,898
Is everything all right?

469
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:19,985
- He beats me.

470
00:27:19,985 --> 00:27:23,058
My whole body is paining me.

471
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:23,891
- Halima!

472
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:26,470
He is your husband.

473
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,420
He can do anything.

474
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,660
- Halima, have you come to visit us?

475
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,590
How is...

476
00:27:40,229 --> 00:27:41,396
You're crying?

477
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,700
What happened?

478
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,043
- He beats me.

479
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:46,963
- He beats you?

480
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,250
How can he beat you?

481
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,933
He's your husband, Halima.

482
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,164
By the way, what did
you do to provoke him?

483
00:27:57,164 --> 00:27:57,997
- Nothing.

484
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,763
- Now go back to your husband's
house and learn to love him.

485
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:06,587
- At this hour?

486
00:28:06,587 --> 00:28:08,420
It's late.
- It's late?

487
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:14,570
Go back to your husband house
and make his home your home.

488
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,773
- Please, no.

489
00:28:19,121 --> 00:28:21,012
Halima, don't worry.

490
00:28:21,012 --> 00:28:23,752
I will take you home tomorrow, yeah?

491
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:28,752
Let's go.

492
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,203
My in-law, I have brought her.

493
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,150
- She ran away?

494
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,940
- Um, yes...

495
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,220
No, she's--

496
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,640
- I understand, I understand.

497
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,757
No problem at all, no problem.

498
00:28:55,363 --> 00:28:57,530
Greet your husband for me.

499
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,957
Where did you go to?

500
00:29:03,957 --> 00:29:06,957
I'm asking you, where did you go to?

501
00:29:26,072 --> 00:29:28,610
- Zara's not speaking to me.

502
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,141
- Why?

503
00:29:30,141 --> 00:29:31,391
- I don't know.

504
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,660
- Zara goes in and out of her moods.

505
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,903
She'll come around.

506
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,583
- I hope so.

507
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,000
She's...

508
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,973
She's seeing a shrink.

509
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,490
- It's nothing unusual these days.

510
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,993
- No, I mean she's dating one.

511
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,853
- Are you sure?

512
00:30:02,805 --> 00:30:05,273
- No, I don't know.

513
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,363
I'm confused.

514
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,890
- Well, you've been together a long time,

515
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,440
and I know she loves you.

516
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,990
I don't think Zara would
do such a thing like that.

517
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,200
- I'm afraid she might
have broken up with me.

518
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,490
- Why do you think that?

519
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,550
- We had an argument.

520
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:25,210
I've never seen her so angry.

521
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,253
- Oh, Alex.

522
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,993
Don't worry, I'll talk to her.

523
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,633
- Alex is gone.

524
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:27,517
You two really--

525
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,763
- Why didn't you tell me?

526
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,303
- Because there was nothing definite.

527
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:44,313
I tried to, but you were
too scared to hear me out.

528
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:48,369
- Are you sure she's really alive?

529
00:31:52,055 --> 00:31:53,940
- Like you, I had my doubts,

530
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,213
but what I found is very hopeful.

531
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:02,563
The nurse confessed, but
I don't know anything yet.

532
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:07,273
On my last trip I was able to
get the address of Madam Kojo,

533
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,373
and I'm hoping to get more
information on this trip.

534
00:32:14,537 --> 00:32:16,373
- Oh, god Mom, what do I do?

535
00:32:19,515 --> 00:32:23,270
- All these years I have watched you grow

536
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:28,193
into a wonderful, successful
doctor and daughter.

537
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,603
And all of these years,

538
00:32:31,603 --> 00:32:34,480
I have watched you suffering silently.

539
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,710
So I think

540
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,940
maybe if you could find out

541
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,523
if your child is alive or dead,

542
00:32:43,292 --> 00:32:46,057
then you can put an end to your suffering.

543
00:32:46,057 --> 00:32:48,364
- Mom, I don't want to go back there,

544
00:32:48,364 --> 00:32:51,499
I don't want to go back there.

545
00:32:51,499 --> 00:32:52,376
- Oh, I know.

546
00:32:52,376 --> 00:32:53,209
- I just can't.

547
00:32:53,209 --> 00:32:55,017
- That's why I'm doing the job for you.

548
00:32:57,021 --> 00:33:01,013
He's one of the most important
men in your country now.

549
00:33:03,105 --> 00:33:04,619
Listen you have to go.

550
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:06,702
- I can't, I can't do this,
Mom, I just can't do this.

551
00:33:06,702 --> 00:33:09,540
- You have to.
- I can't do this.

552
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,327
- You must, you must.

553
00:33:12,208 --> 00:33:15,028
- Mom, your hands are cold.

554
00:33:15,028 --> 00:33:15,861
Mom, Mom?

555
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:16,694
Mom!

556
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:17,861
You okay, Mom?

557
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:20,862
Mom?

558
00:33:22,058 --> 00:33:23,450
- We've manage to stabilize
her, but we're gonna have

559
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,020
to keep her under observation
for next couple of weeks.

560
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,990
- For a week?
- Yes.

561
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,270
- Oh my gosh, she going
to be so devastated.

562
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,790
She's suppose to be on her
medical tour to Africa.

563
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,080
- She would never make it.

564
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,150
She's dehydrated, exhausted
and her heart's in no condition

565
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,930
to be under any strenuous activities.

566
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,190
She will be fine, though.

567
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,420
- I know.

568
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,570
Thanks.

569
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,993
- Dr. Zara, I will look after your mother.

570
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:47,963
- Thank you so much.

571
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:52,560
- Oh, hi darling.

572
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,720
- How are you going?

573
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,840
- What day is it?
- Saturday.

574
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,563
- But my trip.
- It's been canceled.

575
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,963
- We can't disappoint those women.

576
00:34:10,403 --> 00:34:11,653
They are depending on me.

577
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:19,160
We have over 1,000 women
waiting to be treated.

578
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,340
- I know Mom, but right
now we're really more

579
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,490
concerned about your
health and you should.

580
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,590
Relax, okay?

581
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,590
How are you feeling?

582
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:29,720
You still have the headache?

583
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,553
And your back?

584
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,490
I need you to relax, okay?

585
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,890
The doctor's gonna take care of you, okay?

586
00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,887
Just relax, all right, Mom, 'kay?

587
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,050
Alex, it took my a lot
to write this letter

588
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,963
and I'm sorry to leave the
country without seeing you.

589
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,070
I know I have been acting
weird lately and...

590
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,170
But there are just some
things in my past that I need

591
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,653
to confront, some truth
that I need to know.

592
00:35:10,616 --> 00:35:15,616
You have been amazing and I
cannot ask for anyone better,

593
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,020
but for us to move forward
in our relationship,

594
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,690
I need to sort some things out, you know?

595
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:22,673
Like I said to you.

596
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,090
I'm going back home and I just hope

597
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:29,183
everything goes as I planned.

598
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,173
Be patient with me.

599
00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:33,764
I will always love you.

600
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:03,100
Thank you so
much for picking me up.

601
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,130
- It's my pleasure.

602
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,220
When your mother told me that her daughter

603
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,403
was coming to help, I was overjoyed.

604
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,030
She's told me so much about
you, that I've actually

605
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,670
been looking forward to meeting with you.

606
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,980
- Well, we finally meet.

607
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,420
She has also said good
things about you too.

608
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,310
- Oh, thank you.

609
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,633
And thanks for coming to come
help in our small hospital.

610
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,080
Your mother has been of such
great help all these years.

611
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,290
- Well, I just pray that I
will be able to help the little

612
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,540
that I can before she
comes on her next trip,

613
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,895
because I know she would.

614
00:36:38,728 --> 00:36:40,805
I'm sure you would.

615
00:36:40,805 --> 00:36:43,170
But first I will take you to your hotel.

616
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,490
- Okay.
- And then tomorrow

617
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,930
I'll come pick you to the hospital.

618
00:37:03,494 --> 00:37:05,380
- Your mother told me
that you're pregnant.

619
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,960
Congratulations.

620
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,042
Your husband did not waste at all.

621
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,763
Don't mind me.

622
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,950
I hope there's no problem and
that your mother in-law is

623
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,600
not giving you too much problems?

624
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,830
What about the small, small witches?

625
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,423
Your husband's wives?
- No.

626
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,070
- If you need anything
there, don't hesitate.

627
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,257
Just come and ask me, eh?

628
00:37:31,257 --> 00:37:32,090
- Okay.

629
00:37:33,546 --> 00:37:35,160
Thank you.

630
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,590
- Be walking gently, eh?

631
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,423
Okay.

632
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:38,353
- Take care of yourself.

633
00:37:42,203 --> 00:37:43,483
- Look at my daughter!

634
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,460
Isn't she beautiful?
- She's beautiful.

635
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,980
- She'll give me a grandchild
one of these days, very soon.

636
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,930
She has proven that she is the
true daughter of her mother.

637
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,568
Hello, how are you?

638
00:38:01,568 --> 00:38:03,160
Halima, what took you so long?

639
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,072
- I saw my mother's friend Dillaliya.

640
00:38:06,072 --> 00:38:07,072
- Dillaliya?

641
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:09,191
Dillaliya?

642
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
That village gossip!

643
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,720
I can't wait to deal with
that woman one of these days.

644
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,203
We don't want that kind of
association in this family.

645
00:38:28,487 --> 00:38:30,071
Huh,

646
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:30,904
Dillaliya?

647
00:38:47,545 --> 00:38:48,717
Matron, good morning!

648
00:38:48,717 --> 00:38:49,550
- How are you?

649
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,905
Very good.

650
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,490
- So that's the nurses' station,

651
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,886
and here we have the--

652
00:39:07,886 --> 00:39:09,097
- Good morning, matron.

653
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,420
What are we going to do with this case?

654
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,410
- Which one is this?

655
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,160
- The one with the failing surgery.

656
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:19,390
- Oh, Dr. Zara, Mrs. Robin's daughter.

657
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,050
She'll be spending a few weeks with us.

658
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,810
- Oh, she's the one?

659
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:23,793
It's a pleasure to have you here.

660
00:39:23,793 --> 00:39:25,430
- It's a pleasure to be here.

661
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,700
- You're welcomed.
- Thank you.

662
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,200
- Have you talked to Dr.
Londi about this case?

663
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,073
- He's on leave.

664
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:32,940
- Since when?

665
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,690
Over a week now.

666
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,793
- Who authorize it?

667
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:38,290
- Don't know.

668
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:40,993
- Not a worry, I'll handle this.

669
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:43,973
- Everything okay?

670
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,400
- Much as I hate to admit it,

671
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,234
we'll definitely be
needing your help here.

672
00:39:51,234 --> 00:39:54,393
- Oh, how many surgeries
do you carry out in a day?

673
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,153
- One.

674
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,733
If we're lucky, maybe two.

675
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,810
These are trying times.

676
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:06,480
It used to be like 10 a day,
but with no more support,

677
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,283
everyone just keep silent
about the condition.

678
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:17,240
- There are lots of women here.

679
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,370
- Every time I see them my heart bleeds.

680
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:22,310
But we are looking for
more preventives ways

681
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:24,243
to keep them out of this condition.

682
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,380
- Can I see the file on the girl?

683
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,550
- Oh yeah, and that's the girl.

684
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,383
- Oh.

685
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,463
- I can't understand why
her surgeries keep failing.

686
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,250
- Well, I can see here that
the hole on her bladder

687
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,010
has been closed, but the bladder function

688
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:50,670
has still not been restored,
and I think we have to start

689
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:53,303
by doing a urodynamics examination on her.

690
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,230
What more can we do to stop this?

691
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,540
- We have been battling
with this condition now

692
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,420
for the past 10 years now.

693
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,980
Yet they still fall victim.

694
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,870
They still believe in early
marriages, female circumcision,

695
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,120
and giving birth at home.

696
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,833
- Let me handle this case.

697
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,963
- You were meant to observe today.

698
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,240
- I have seen enough from
a distance, I can tell you.

699
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,010
Where do all these women come from?

700
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,563
- From all over the country.

701
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,556
It's no longer the thing of the north.

702
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:31,180
We have so many woman out there

703
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,590
who don't even believe
they can still be cured.

704
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,750
- I need to do one more operation on her.

705
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:36,750
Prepare her.

706
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,938
- Fatima! Fatima!

707
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,663
She's not here?

708
00:42:09,663 --> 00:42:10,496
- No she's not.

709
00:42:10,496 --> 00:42:12,123
- I think you should go and
find this woman by yourself.

710
00:42:12,123 --> 00:42:13,462
- I don't know her house Hajia.

711
00:42:13,462 --> 00:42:14,604
- Where's Sani?

712
00:42:14,604 --> 00:42:15,798
Let him to go and look for her.

713
00:42:15,798 --> 00:42:16,631
I should call Sani.

714
00:42:16,631 --> 00:42:19,874
- Let them go and look for her!

715
00:42:19,874 --> 00:42:20,853
- Hajia, he's here

716
00:42:20,853 --> 00:42:21,957
Why don't you go

717
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:24,013
and find the birth attendant now?

718
00:42:24,013 --> 00:42:26,250
- Ma, I don't know, I don't know.

719
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,813
I don't know where she is.

720
00:42:27,813 --> 00:42:30,396
I said you should
go to Adamu's compound,

721
00:42:30,396 --> 00:42:32,298
ask them they will tell
show you where she is.

722
00:42:32,298 --> 00:42:33,601
- Okay.

723
00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:35,184
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

724
00:42:52,526 --> 00:42:53,359
- I still feel we should
take her to the hospital.

725
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,790
- No, Hajia, no worries,
I already check her.

726
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:59,723
Her tummy worries, when her
tummy rests she will deliver.

727
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,490
- Why don't you give
her at least something?

728
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:05,323
- Okay, give her this--

729
00:43:05,323 --> 00:43:06,950
- She's carrying my grandchild.

730
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,203
- Give her this one.

731
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:16,241
- I don't trust this, I
think we should take Halima

732
00:43:16,241 --> 00:43:17,074
to the hospital--

733
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:43,230
Let's go to the hospital!

734
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:05,730
- Alhaji, have you seen my shop?

735
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:09,713
Alhaji just look at my
babes and make your pick.

736
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,860
- Who is she?

737
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,493
- Wow, she's new in the business.

738
00:44:18,836 --> 00:44:20,270
- I think I like to go with this one,

739
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,240
I can go for her.

740
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,373
- Okay, I'll deliver her to you.

741
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,280
Be the first to taste her.

742
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,113
- Hey!

743
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:28,963
Madam Kojo!

744
00:44:38,386 --> 00:44:40,100
- She bit your ears?

745
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,620
You think you can ruin my business?

746
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:46,620
You little rat, you almost made
me lose a valuable customer.

747
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,190
Take her away and do to her what we do

748
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:51,069
to disobedient servants.

749
00:44:51,069 --> 00:44:52,284
You can do anything.

750
00:44:52,284 --> 00:44:54,701
Stupid girl, make her suffer.

751
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,090
- Good afternoon.

752
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,940
- Um, I'm looking for Madam Kojo.

753
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,183
- Madam Kojo?

754
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:28,177
- Well, where can I find her?

755
00:45:29,123 --> 00:45:30,173
- I don't know.

756
00:45:34,203 --> 00:45:36,870
- Ragamu, where is, where is it?

757
00:45:39,047 --> 00:45:41,453
- Look around here, ask the
people around this area,

758
00:45:41,453 --> 00:45:42,857
they will tell you.

759
00:45:42,857 --> 00:45:45,774
- But she used to live here before.

760
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,640
- He said when we get to
Ragamu, we should ask of her.

761
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,113
Do you know how to get there

762
00:47:13,113 --> 00:47:15,689
or I should I just call someone else?

763
00:47:15,689 --> 00:47:16,522
- Ragamu?

764
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,253
- Yes.

765
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:22,150
- That's quite far away from town.

766
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:24,760
I didn't know the new doctor is a local.

767
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,090
- No I was just talking to the driver

768
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,120
to see if he can get me there.

769
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,360
- Oh, okay.

770
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,400
Well, Dr. Londi.

771
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,036
- Oh, Dr. Zara.

772
00:47:34,036 --> 00:47:35,410
- Oh?

773
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:37,680
- Oh, yes, I was actually
looking forward to meeting you.

774
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,143
I heard you were on leave.

775
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:42,993
- As you can see obviously
I'm back to the same struggle.

776
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,280
I could drive you down there.

777
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,130
I mean, I mean to Ragamu.

778
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,253
- Oh, no, don't worry, doc,
the driver will take me.

779
00:47:52,328 --> 00:47:53,880
- All right, you're welcomed.

780
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,100
I hope you don't crash and
burn under the pressure.

781
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,157
- I hope not too.

782
00:47:58,421 --> 00:48:00,743
- Okay, I heard you fixed the girl.

783
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,002
Her case has been quite challenging.

784
00:48:06,002 --> 00:48:08,102
- Well, I'm happy that I could be of help.

785
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:12,340
- Modest, I would say for
a doctor of your caliber.

786
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,810
Well, um, they will keep
coming with the same cases

787
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:18,200
over and over again, so
roll up your sleeves.

788
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,870
Nice to meet you.

789
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:20,703
- Same here.

790
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,170
- Well, hope you enjoy it.

791
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,620
- I hope so.

792
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:28,020
- Your mom always do,
whenever she comes around.

793
00:48:56,688 --> 00:48:59,323
- Halima, come, come, come, come.

794
00:48:59,323 --> 00:49:01,750
What's wrong with you, huh?

795
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,078
Why you wet?

796
00:49:03,911 --> 00:49:04,744
Why you dripping?

797
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,147
Let me check you.

798
00:49:10,078 --> 00:49:11,411
This is serious.

799
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,300
- Matron, Nurse Ramatu just told me that

800
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,833
Dr. Londi wants to quit?

801
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,560
- He's not the first one to do that.

802
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,393
- Why?

803
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:38,650
- Doctor, there is no money
in treating fistula patients.

804
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:42,253
It's a job of passion,
no financial reward.

805
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:45,420
We pick them up after medical school,

806
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,950
train them as fistula
surgeons, the next thing,

807
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,383
they want to move to
the teaching hospitals.

808
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:55,333
- How have you been
coping all these years?

809
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,703
- God.

810
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:01,570
In my many years on this job,

811
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:03,120
your mother knows about it all.

812
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,360
I just believe that when
we take pity on the poor,

813
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,903
poor in health, we lend to God.

814
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:14,740
- But is there no way
they get their payment

815
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,890
directly from the government?

816
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:21,240
- Oh yes, we have sent a proposal
to the ministry of health,

817
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:25,217
we told them, "Pay them
and retain them here

818
00:50:25,217 --> 00:50:26,777
"as fistula surgeons."

819
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:31,620
We can only train because we have to,

820
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,883
but we can't force them to stay.

821
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,570
- Dr. Londi, think about it.

822
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:42,853
- Think about what, Zara?

823
00:50:42,853 --> 00:50:44,520
I can't do this anymore.

824
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,350
I've got a wife, I've
got one, two, three kids,

825
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:49,220
I've got aged parents,
I've got cousins, siblings

826
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,970
all staying in my place,
waiting for manna to fall

827
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:53,580
from heaven, and you know?

828
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,960
I am the provider of that manna.

829
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,225
Don't you understand?

830
00:50:57,225 --> 00:50:58,058
- But you save the little you can.

831
00:50:58,058 --> 00:51:00,696
You are a medical doctor,
your duty is to save lives.

832
00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:04,670
- But guess what, I did
not sign a vow of poverty.

833
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:05,877
There are so many opportunities out there

834
00:51:05,877 --> 00:51:08,593
and I'm going in search of one, please.

835
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,750
Now listen, it's rather
depressing going home in this gear

836
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:17,063
everyday and with the smell.

837
00:51:24,072 --> 00:51:24,905
I've made up my mind.

838
00:51:24,905 --> 00:51:27,930
You're not going to get
Londi this time, honestly.

839
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:32,930
I'm gone, Londi, you're gone,
Londi, you gone.

840
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,400
- What are you doing here?

841
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,813
- Halima, come here, come.

842
00:51:58,141 --> 00:51:58,974
Come here.

843
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:01,083
Sit.

844
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:05,427
Halima, do not let them get to you, okay?

845
00:52:05,427 --> 00:52:08,320
- I don't know what is wrong with me.

846
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,800
- Nothing is wrong with
you, my dear, nothing.

847
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,400
- Oh please!

848
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,700
Why you lie to her?

849
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:16,510
She obviously some kind of
abomination to have this

850
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:18,700
kind of disease.

851
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:21,290
- Isn't that the same thing
that happened to Ayesha?

852
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:22,360
They said she committed adultery.

853
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,203
- Mariam, keep quiet!

854
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,330
You both should be ashamed of yourselves.

855
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,888
This poor girl have just
lost her baby recently.

856
00:52:30,888 --> 00:52:32,332
Where is your conscience, you two?

857
00:52:32,332 --> 00:52:34,415
Where is your conscience?

858
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:39,387
Come, let me clean you up, okay?

859
00:52:39,387 --> 00:52:40,864
Don't worry, you'll be okay.

860
00:53:35,899 --> 00:53:37,703
- Open the door for me.

861
00:53:37,703 --> 00:53:38,703
- All right.

862
00:53:41,876 --> 00:53:43,027
Halimagida, you're here.

863
00:53:43,027 --> 00:53:43,860
- Can I come in?

864
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,693
- Welcome.

865
00:53:44,693 --> 00:53:45,693
- Thank you.

866
00:54:03,827 --> 00:54:04,660
- Hello.

867
00:54:56,564 --> 00:54:57,563
(Screaming

868
00:54:57,563 --> 00:54:58,646
- Push, push!

869
00:55:04,065 --> 00:55:05,910
- Madam Kojo.

870
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:07,493
Do you remember me?

871
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:16,633
It's Zara.

872
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:21,673
Where's my child?

873
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,450
Where is my baby?

874
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,850
Mom, she couldn't tell me anything.

875
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:50,647
It looks like I will never
know what happened to her.

876
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,991
I don't even know why I came
here in the first place.

877
00:55:54,991 --> 00:55:56,250
Mom, I just need to find her,

878
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:59,000
that's all I want is to find her.

879
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:00,853
Zara.

880
00:56:00,853 --> 00:56:01,890
- Yes?

881
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:03,190
You're in Africa.

882
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:05,900
Get closure on this so you
can move on with your life.

883
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:37,570
- The whole village is
talking about Halima

884
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:40,470
and this dreaded disease she
has brought to our household.

885
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:44,405
- I don't know what to do.

886
00:56:44,405 --> 00:56:46,259
- You don't know what to do?

887
00:56:46,259 --> 00:56:48,637
Hey, son, you don't know what to do?

888
00:56:48,637 --> 00:56:51,490
Well if you don't know what to do, I do.

889
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:54,050
I will arrange to send
her to the buka's house.

890
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:56,330
Because I even suspect
that this is an evil attack

891
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,693
or even witchcraft, Sani.

892
00:56:59,148 --> 00:56:59,981
- Hajia!

893
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,500
- Can you imagine the amount
the money that we spent on

894
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,500
that girl and her family
only for them to turn around

895
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,560
and make us a laughing
stock in this village?

896
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,489
Don't forget, Sani, the possibility

897
00:57:12,489 --> 00:57:16,373
that she may have even committed adultery.

898
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,051
- I disvirgined the girl.

899
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:22,330
And she has remained in
the confines of this home

900
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:23,820
since I married her.

901
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:26,037
- What about that time that she ran away?

902
00:57:26,037 --> 00:57:28,186
What about when she ran away
and we couldn't find her

903
00:57:28,186 --> 00:57:29,019
until her mother brought her?

904
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:31,860
Do you know if she went in
search of her old boyfriends?

905
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,280
And then the other time, do you remember?

906
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,110
When I sent her to call
Adamu's mother for me,

907
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,717
she went away and never came
back, when she got here,

908
00:57:36,717 --> 00:57:38,180
she said she's got lost.

909
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,111
Got lost, Sani, in this tiny village,

910
00:57:40,111 --> 00:57:43,111
where the even cockroaches can
find their way to the stream.

911
00:57:43,111 --> 00:57:44,052
Don't be naive, Sani.

912
00:57:44,052 --> 00:57:45,163
Don't be naive!

913
00:57:45,163 --> 00:57:46,110
- They are saying our whole household

914
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:48,790
is infected with disease, Halimagida

915
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:49,623
- Everyone smell, you know?

916
00:57:49,623 --> 00:57:51,830
And people should stop
coming to our house.

917
00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:54,380
We are just coming from Kiki's place.

918
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,550
It's Fatima.

919
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:56,383
Fatima!

920
00:57:56,383 --> 00:57:57,216
- What is it, Mariam?

921
00:57:57,216 --> 00:58:00,445
You people should leave
the poor girl alone.

922
00:58:00,445 --> 00:58:01,510
- Have I not warned you before,

923
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,010
have I not told not to take her out?

924
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:04,963
- But mama, she has to go out.

925
00:58:06,951 --> 00:58:09,070
- Hey, it's enough!

926
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,030
Halima, we will have put
you in a room where you stay

927
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,690
for a while before I decide
on what to do with you.

928
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:16,733
No going out and no cooking.

929
00:58:24,902 --> 00:58:26,902
- What is the emergency?

930
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:29,070
- All the doctors have resigned.

931
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:29,903
- What?

932
00:58:29,903 --> 00:58:32,320
- As soon as Dr. Londi left,
they all got discouraged.

933
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,890
Right now we have a back
log of women waiting for

934
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:38,460
repairs and we are short
of medical supplies.

935
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,293
- What are we going to do?

936
00:58:39,293 --> 00:58:41,117
I mean, who is going to
pay for their surgeries?

937
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:43,740
- People in the rural area
cannot even afford to pay

938
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,310
for the first procedures in the surgery.

939
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:48,210
- Can't leave them here.

940
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:49,753
Who is the current Minister of Health?

941
00:58:49,753 --> 00:58:52,030
- Miss Zara Robbins.

942
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:55,440
I am quite touched by
your zeal on fistula.

943
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,180
This is the ministry of health

944
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:01,890
and we do supervise every
kind of medical condition

945
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:04,010
We've been working on Fistula for years.

946
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:09,010
But we have some budget
constraints at the moment.

947
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:12,290
I will suggest you try
the office of the MDGs.

948
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:13,890
Maybe they can help you for now.

949
00:59:14,736 --> 00:59:16,440
- What do we do, Dillaliya?

950
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,560
- Didn't I say it?

951
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,759
I knew that Sani's mother is a witch.

952
00:59:19,759 --> 00:59:21,800
Look at what has befallen
our pretty Halima

953
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,438
in the hands of that wicked family.

954
00:59:23,438 --> 00:59:25,855
- Dillaliya? Solution please.

955
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:36,643
- Who told you to take
her out of this compound?

956
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:39,720
Is it not enough that the
whole village is talking

957
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,410
about this dreaded disease that
she brought upon our family?

958
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:43,700
You had to go and parade her around,

959
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,360
round the whole village?

960
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,540
- Mama, We just went to the
market to pick up some fish.

961
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,800
You know she hasn't left this house since.

962
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,270
- What do you mean, she has
not left the house since?

963
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:53,290
Since she brought this
disease unto our family,

964
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:56,103
do you know the kind of disgrace
that my son has received?

965
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,002
Young lady, this is not the
time to cry, let me tell you.

966
01:00:01,002 --> 01:00:02,210
Do you understand that?

967
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:05,854
You stay in your room until
we decide what to do with you.

968
01:00:05,854 --> 01:00:08,333
- We will wait for our
husband to tell us what to do.

969
01:00:10,748 --> 01:00:12,180
- Fatima!

970
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:13,520
Your husband!

971
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,430
Let me remind you in case you
have forgotten, that he is

972
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:19,453
my son and I make the
decision here in his absence.

973
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:22,470
So you don't stand there
and tell me anything

974
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:23,860
about anything.

975
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:26,798
Now, you go to your room
and go and do your cooking

976
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:28,710
and while you are at
it Fatima, clean her up

977
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:30,623
before the whole house starts smelling.

978
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:45,880
- Go back to your father.

979
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,640
Go and let your family
share in this embarrassment.

980
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,370
Why should I be the only one to suffer?

981
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:52,653
What did I do wrong?

982
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:56,724
I waited for you, bought
gifts for your family,

983
01:00:56,724 --> 01:00:58,030
married you the right way.

984
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,990
What was my crime?

985
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,100
Please go!

986
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,990
Whatever your sins are,

987
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:05,149
I will not suffer along with you.

988
01:01:05,149 --> 01:01:06,589
- Husband, please.

989
01:01:06,589 --> 01:01:07,894
- Who is your husband?

990
01:01:07,894 --> 01:01:09,690
You are the one who
knows who you slept with

991
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:12,517
that gave you this terrible disease.

992
01:01:12,517 --> 01:01:14,372
- Halimagida, please I beg you.

993
01:01:14,372 --> 01:01:16,817
I didn't sleep with anyone.

994
01:01:16,817 --> 01:01:19,017
Please don't chase me away.

995
01:01:19,017 --> 01:01:20,860
My parents won't receive me.

996
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:23,013
- Why won't they reject you, you witch?

997
01:01:26,613 --> 01:01:29,007
I don't know what made
me waste my money on you.

998
01:01:29,007 --> 01:01:31,020
The whole house smells.

999
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,160
My friends can no longer
come and pay me a visit,

1000
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,420
and to worsen it you can't
bear children anymore.

1001
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:39,660
Who will want to sleep
with a rotten pig like you?

1002
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,051
Who?

1003
01:01:41,051 --> 01:01:41,884
Hey, listen to me!

1004
01:01:41,884 --> 01:01:42,908
- What happened, huh?

1005
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:44,491
Halima!
- Excuse me!

1006
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:49,049
If I see you near her,

1007
01:01:49,049 --> 01:01:52,666
you'll pack your things
to your father's house.

1008
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:53,994
- Please, please,

1009
01:01:53,994 --> 01:01:56,928
she's just a little girl,
Hajia, please, please!

1010
01:02:13,553 --> 01:02:15,371
- Hajia please.

1011
01:02:15,371 --> 01:02:17,157
- Hajia, please, see the
little girl in front to you.

1012
01:02:17,157 --> 01:02:19,074
Please beg out husband.

1013
01:02:22,467 --> 01:02:23,300
- Please.

1014
01:02:27,464 --> 01:02:28,297
- Come on.

1015
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:32,947
Don't worry, it's going to be okay.

1016
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:41,539
- Please Halimagida, please.

1017
01:02:41,539 --> 01:02:44,879
She's our daughter, where will she go?

1018
01:02:44,879 --> 01:02:45,890
She's not a witch, please
don't listen to them.

1019
01:02:47,975 --> 01:02:48,808
- Please.

1020
01:02:55,284 --> 01:02:56,214
- She has to go.

1021
01:02:56,214 --> 01:02:57,456
- Where will she go?

1022
01:02:57,456 --> 01:02:59,289
There's nowhere to go.

1023
01:03:04,749 --> 01:03:08,618
- My hands are tied,
there is nothing I can do.

1024
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,742
- She needs us now, she needs us.

1025
01:03:10,742 --> 01:03:11,575
- Please.

1026
01:03:14,882 --> 01:03:15,716
- Please.

1027
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,430
What kind of a man are you?

1028
01:03:46,623 --> 01:03:48,040
- Halima, Halima.

1029
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:10,522
- I wish I would die.

1030
01:04:10,522 --> 01:04:12,500
The dead are better than me.

1031
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,100
- Don't say that, my daughter.

1032
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,820
There must be a solution.

1033
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:16,970
I brought food for you.

1034
01:04:25,257 --> 01:04:26,090
Eat.

1035
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,210
- I heard there's a new doctor in town

1036
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,623
who can cure your disease.

1037
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:45,470
I came with some clothes and food for you.

1038
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:48,540
I'll come and pick you up
tomorrow evening, okay?

1039
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:49,787
I'll take you there.

1040
01:04:58,118 --> 01:05:01,118
- Fatima, where are you coming from?

1041
01:05:02,863 --> 01:05:05,520
Sit down, you went to Usuman's house.

1042
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,443
Why did you have to stay that long?

1043
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:11,160
- Um, when I was coming, uh--

1044
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,040
- Anyway, just sit down, join us.

1045
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,773
We are having a family discussion.

1046
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:22,180
As I was saying, everyone in
the village is now thinking

1047
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:25,173
that there is something
wrong with this family,

1048
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,283
but thank God that Halima is out of here.

1049
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:33,270
So, the best thing to do
now is to marry another wife

1050
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:35,820
since I have divorced her.

1051
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:39,023
We need to cleanse this
home and restore my dignity.

1052
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:44,003
- Our husband, we need to
be careful this time around.

1053
01:05:45,903 --> 01:05:48,538
I mean, why'd you rush?

1054
01:05:48,538 --> 01:05:51,573
I think we should recover
from this Halima issue first.

1055
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:55,160
- Halimagida, Mariam is right.

1056
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,133
And also we are here to
take very good care of you.

1057
01:05:59,947 --> 01:06:03,110
You don't know what
another wife might bring.

1058
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:06,070
We have been living in
peace for a while now.

1059
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:07,240
Please, mai gida,

1060
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,596
don't invite anymore evil into our midst.

1061
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:12,393
- Let me make this clearer.

1062
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:17,643
He is not asking for your
opinion on this matter.

1063
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:22,733
He is only sharing his
intentions with you.

1064
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:26,663
His very good intentions.

1065
01:06:28,804 --> 01:06:33,760
- Halimagida, as for me, since
you have made up your mind,

1066
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,387
I don't have anything to say.

1067
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:57,193
- You are a witch, you are
a witch, you are a witch!

1068
01:06:59,036 --> 01:07:01,354
You need to see the condition of--

1069
01:07:01,354 --> 01:07:02,276
- Doctor Mutanga!

1070
01:07:02,276 --> 01:07:03,970
- What is it again?

1071
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:05,820
- We have another case, so.

1072
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:06,864
- Another case?

1073
01:07:06,864 --> 01:07:07,697
Another case.

1074
01:07:07,697 --> 01:07:08,530
- How?

1075
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:12,607
Because of this disease
you carry,.

1076
01:07:12,607 --> 01:07:13,873
- I have told you, don't drop that woman.

1077
01:07:14,706 --> 01:07:17,714
Don't drop that woman there!

1078
01:07:17,714 --> 01:07:19,547
I thought this was
supposed to be a hospital!

1079
01:07:19,547 --> 01:07:22,252
Either you serve life, or to kill.

1080
01:07:22,252 --> 01:07:23,460
- Don't drop that woman!

1081
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:24,894
Come, come back here!

1082
01:07:24,894 --> 01:07:25,727
Come back here!

1083
01:07:25,727 --> 01:07:27,537
Come back, I can't carry this one!

1084
01:07:32,971 --> 01:07:35,050
- Please we are here to see the doctor.

1085
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:36,103
My friend needs help.

1086
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:52,470
- Fill this form.

1087
01:07:54,368 --> 01:07:55,800
- We can't read or write.

1088
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,140
- Well, sit down there.

1089
01:07:57,140 --> 01:08:00,327
When Ike comes, he will help you fill it.

1090
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:26,773
- I know.

1091
01:08:37,031 --> 01:08:42,031
- Oh, man, fu...

1092
01:08:42,188 --> 01:08:43,228
- Dr. Mutanga!

1093
01:08:43,228 --> 01:08:47,997
- No, no, go and, go and
put on the generator.

1094
01:08:47,997 --> 01:08:49,997
I am operating here now.

1095
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:56,980
- Why didn't anybody tell me?

1096
01:08:58,150 --> 01:08:59,832
We used the last one this month.

1097
01:08:59,832 --> 01:09:03,096
- Okay, nurse give him some money, eh?

1098
01:09:03,096 --> 01:09:05,194
And you, just hurry up
and put on the generator.

1099
01:09:05,194 --> 01:09:06,669
I'm seriously doing something here.

1100
01:09:06,669 --> 01:09:11,669
- Dr. Mutanga, I no get any money.

1101
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,570
- My friend give him the money.

1102
01:09:15,570 --> 01:09:17,017
What's your problem?

1103
01:09:17,017 --> 01:09:17,860
And I warned you people,

1104
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:20,702
no speaking Pidgin English in this place.

1105
01:09:20,702 --> 01:09:21,535
- Ah!

1106
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:25,350
- I don't know how to
handle her case, honestly.

1107
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:27,610
I don't know where to start from.

1108
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:30,730
See, where is the pen?

1109
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:32,856
- Doctor, it's on your head.

1110
01:09:32,856 --> 01:09:33,970
- Oh, sorry.

1111
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:38,473
See, the only kind of cases we
handle here are child birth,

1112
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:44,750
you know, appendix, malaria,
two plus or three plus,

1113
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:48,533
typhoid, eczema, meningitis, all this.

1114
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:53,350
But this case, I don't even
have the kind of equipment

1115
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:55,709
to perform that kind of surgery.

1116
01:09:55,709 --> 01:09:57,910
- But doctor, they told
us that you are very good.

1117
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:59,777
- I'm very good, honestly.

1118
01:09:59,777 --> 01:10:03,080
But I'm sorry, I cannot

1119
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,585
help your friend.

1120
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,113
Nurse!

1121
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:23,270
- Thank you so much, and
we are very grateful for,

1122
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:25,510
you know, assisting us
in such a short notice.

1123
01:10:25,510 --> 01:10:26,650
- Anytime.

1124
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:30,280
Are you still doing the mobile
clinic in the rural villages?

1125
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:33,140
- Oh, yes, I and some doctors
are going round the villages

1126
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:35,950
to operate on these women, and
since they can't come to us,

1127
01:10:35,950 --> 01:10:36,990
we have go to them.

1128
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:39,210
- Of course, of course,
that's the best strategy.

1129
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:41,210
I'll be on my way now, but remember,

1130
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,420
we're always there to help.

1131
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:43,857
- Thank you, thank you very much.

1132
01:10:43,857 --> 01:10:44,769
Thank you.
- Thank you.

1133
01:10:44,769 --> 01:10:45,769
- Thank you.

1134
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,300
- Ayesha!

1135
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:58,660
How are you doing?

1136
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:02,010
Look at you, looking all fine and pretty.

1137
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:03,480
- Thank you.

1138
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,290
- You're going to be discharged next week.

1139
01:11:05,290 --> 01:11:07,404
- I know, Matron told me.

1140
01:11:07,404 --> 01:11:10,080
I hear you're going to the villages?

1141
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:13,060
- Mhm, next week, in
a few weeks, actually.

1142
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:16,423
- Doctor, please can you start with mine?

1143
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:22,350
I know this girl that has this
condition and she has been

1144
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:24,463
abandoned by her husband and family.

1145
01:11:25,697 --> 01:11:27,670
I would like you to help her.

1146
01:11:27,670 --> 01:11:29,580
I can take you around the villages.

1147
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:32,080
- I doubt if you're
strong enough to do that.

1148
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,513
- Doctor, please.

1149
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,883
Let me go with your team.

1150
01:11:36,883 --> 01:11:41,360
I understand the language
and can assist in any way.

1151
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,930
- Okay, I will think
about it, but right now

1152
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:47,968
I need you to go to
your bed and rest, okay?

1153
01:11:47,968 --> 01:11:48,801
- Okay.

1154
01:11:48,801 --> 01:11:49,850
- I'll let you know.

1155
01:11:53,465 --> 01:11:54,395
- Help!

1156
01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:55,951
Somebody help me!

1157
01:11:55,951 --> 01:11:56,932
- What happened to her?

1158
01:11:56,932 --> 01:11:58,160
- She has been in labor for days now.

1159
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,127
- How many days?

1160
01:11:59,127 --> 01:12:01,127
- Four days.
- Four days?

1161
01:12:14,025 --> 01:12:14,858
Oh, she's bleeding.

1162
01:12:14,858 --> 01:12:17,120
More gauze, more gauze, more gauze.

1163
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:18,037
More gauze.

1164
01:12:24,296 --> 01:12:25,323
No! Wake up!

1165
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,193
God.

1166
01:12:46,481 --> 01:12:48,480
- I heard what happened.

1167
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,370
- If only they had
brought her early enough!

1168
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:53,890
If only they had brought her here on time!

1169
01:12:53,890 --> 01:12:56,900
- This happens while we are
still trying to save many.

1170
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:58,999
We can't save every life.

1171
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:00,930
- But I could have saved this one.

1172
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:02,450
Why do they bring her
here when they allow her

1173
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:03,590
to give birth at home?

1174
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:04,800
What is the point?

1175
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,710
Her records show she
attended antenatal care here,

1176
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:08,820
but when she's about to give birth,

1177
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:10,510
she's locked up with some quacks!

1178
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:12,860
And then she's about to die, they remember

1179
01:13:12,860 --> 01:13:14,037
there's a freaking
clinic around the corner!

1180
01:13:14,037 --> 01:13:16,390
What's wrong with all these people?

1181
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:19,270
- These people do not know any better.

1182
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:23,500
Hey, you don't have to
be so hard on yourself.

1183
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:26,040
We can't entirely comprehend it.

1184
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:29,860
It's hard enough that they allow
little babies to give birth

1185
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:34,860
to babies with no
professional help whatsoever.

1186
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:37,860
We don't have all the answers,

1187
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:40,250
but we are doing all we can.

1188
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,700
- No!

1189
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,120
We need to do more.

1190
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:46,430
We can't keep losing these women.

1191
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:47,780
I mean there has to be way!

1192
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:55,382
If they can't come to
us, we will go to them.

1193
01:13:55,382 --> 01:13:57,080
Yesterday
Honorable Musa received

1194
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:59,910
an award of excellence from
the Speaker of the House

1195
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:01,243
for his contribution.

1196
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:06,110
Honorable Musa said he was very
elated to receive the award,

1197
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:06,943
and that he will--

1198
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:08,553
- He's one of the few I like.

1199
01:14:11,517 --> 01:14:12,350
- Okay.

1200
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:18,840
- Some of the doctors have
indicated their interest.

1201
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,530
- Oh, that's wonderful, that's great.

1202
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:24,870
So that means we can start
with the nearest village.

1203
01:14:24,870 --> 01:14:25,703
- That's right.

1204
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:28,537
- Do you want some tea?

1205
01:14:29,377 --> 01:14:31,476
- Oh no, I'm just fine, thank you.

1206
01:14:31,476 --> 01:14:33,124
- Okay.

1207
01:14:42,723 --> 01:14:45,287
- So if you know anybody that has VVF,

1208
01:14:45,287 --> 01:14:49,489
anybody that has fistula, our
bus is set up in that place,

1209
01:14:49,489 --> 01:14:52,733
tell the person to come
so we can repair them.

1210
01:15:19,134 --> 01:15:20,884
Go, go, go!

1211
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,591
- What is going on, Ayesha?

1212
01:15:43,591 --> 01:15:46,341
- It's the girl I told you about.

1213
01:15:47,545 --> 01:15:48,378
- Why are they stoning her?

1214
01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:50,199
I don't understand.
- I don't know.

1215
01:15:50,199 --> 01:15:51,970
Please do something!

1216
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:53,263
- Matron!

1217
01:15:53,263 --> 01:15:54,435
Did you see what is going on?

1218
01:15:54,435 --> 01:15:55,271
- Yes, I've seen it all.

1219
01:15:55,271 --> 01:15:57,077
- They can't just stone her
like that, are they crazy?

1220
01:15:57,077 --> 01:15:59,637
Come on, come
on, come here, come back!

1221
01:15:59,637 --> 01:16:01,162
Doctor Zara, come back.

1222
01:16:01,162 --> 01:16:02,401
No, no, no, let's go, let's go.

1223
01:16:02,401 --> 01:16:03,240
Not now.

1224
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,316
Get into the car.

1225
01:16:04,316 --> 01:16:05,149
- They can't just do that.

1226
01:16:05,149 --> 01:16:08,270
Listen, just get
into the car now, please!

1227
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:09,103
Please!

1228
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:11,880
- Take your food.

1229
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:16,600
What more do you want
me to do for you, huh?

1230
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,650
Tell me, what do you want?

1231
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:20,673
- I want my childhood back.

1232
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:23,363
I want to be a girl again,

1233
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:29,380
playing in my father's compound
with the other children.

1234
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:30,213
Laughing,

1235
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,413
clapping,

1236
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:34,963
staying by my mother,

1237
01:16:36,730 --> 01:16:38,233
helping out in the kitchen,

1238
01:16:40,339 --> 01:16:43,183
listening to folklore under the moon.

1239
01:16:48,347 --> 01:16:49,783
Can you get that for me?

1240
01:16:51,135 --> 01:16:51,968
Can you?

1241
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,333
- Halima.

1242
01:16:57,540 --> 01:17:00,483
- Did you hear what happened
to me in the market?

1243
01:17:00,483 --> 01:17:04,072
- Yes, I heard what happened
to you in the market, Halima,

1244
01:17:04,072 --> 01:17:05,943
but you have to be strong.

1245
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,533
Stop crying.

1246
01:17:08,533 --> 01:17:11,403
Have to believe things will
work out themselves somehow.

1247
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,153
- Yes, what do you want?

1248
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:24,347
- Please, what is wrong with her?

1249
01:17:24,347 --> 01:17:26,288
- What's your problem in
what is wrong with her?

1250
01:17:26,288 --> 01:17:28,650
Are you her for gossip or you
want to hear it from my mouth?

1251
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:29,990
- I'm only here to help.

1252
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:31,760
- Which help, which help?

1253
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,160
Didn't you hear what happened
to her at the village?

1254
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:35,560
- I saw what happened today.

1255
01:17:41,230 --> 01:17:43,033
I came with the medical team.

1256
01:17:49,630 --> 01:17:51,810
- We went to the hospital.

1257
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:54,433
They could not help, so leave us alone.

1258
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:57,080
- Please don't talk like that.

1259
01:17:58,322 --> 01:18:01,110
I understand what you are going through.

1260
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:03,140
I went through the same thing too,

1261
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:05,363
but now I'm dry.

1262
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:10,044
- Just go, go, I don't
want to go anywhere.

1263
01:18:10,044 --> 01:18:11,468
Go, go!

1264
01:18:13,710 --> 01:18:14,543
Go!

1265
01:18:14,543 --> 01:18:15,960
- Halima, Halima.

1266
01:18:16,996 --> 01:18:20,120
- I know you know where she is.

1267
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:23,223
You don't know the guilt I
carried with me all these years.

1268
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:27,933
I just want to know that she is happy,

1269
01:18:29,026 --> 01:18:32,000
or if she's in a good home, or?

1270
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,050
Just anything.

1271
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:38,561
I beg you, tell me something,
just tell me just anything.

1272
01:18:38,561 --> 01:18:39,700
I beg you.

1273
01:18:39,700 --> 01:18:42,193
- She was struck with
stroke a few years back,

1274
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:44,690
but she's recovering.

1275
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:47,203
She speaks like, once in a while.

1276
01:18:48,049 --> 01:18:49,670
- Who are you?

1277
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:53,490
- My name is Rita and I'm her daughter.

1278
01:18:53,490 --> 01:18:56,240
- Well, I just want to know
what she did with my child.

1279
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:01,710
- She told me about her.

1280
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:04,690
She said it was the biggest
regrets of her life.

1281
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:06,330
- I don't care about that.

1282
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:09,810
I'm sorry your mother was
such a horrible person.

1283
01:19:09,810 --> 01:19:11,920
All I need to know is to find my baby.

1284
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:13,140
I want to know where my child is.

1285
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:14,440
That's all I want to know.

1286
01:19:17,967 --> 01:19:19,517
- Um.

1287
01:19:19,517 --> 01:19:23,130
There's a woman in Kuma
village, her name is Hadiza,

1288
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:25,760
but I don't know if she still lives there.

1289
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:29,503
- Just give me any information,
anything, I can find her.

1290
01:19:29,503 --> 01:19:31,150
- I don't know much.

1291
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:35,290
I'm so sorry, but be rest
assured, if I find something,

1292
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:38,442
I'll definitely contact you.

1293
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:38,843
- Hello?

1294
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:47,003
Hello?

1295
01:20:51,230 --> 01:20:52,063
Hello?

1296
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,510
Good afternoon.

1297
01:20:59,510 --> 01:21:00,927
- Good afternoon.

1298
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,333
- Please sir, we are looking for Hadiza.

1299
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:07,940
- Is everything all right?

1300
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:11,330
- Yes, no problem, but is this her house?

1301
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:12,500
- Yes, this is her house.

1302
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:15,793
I'm her husband but she
has gone to the market.

1303
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:18,690
Is anything the matter, please?

1304
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:21,935
- No, no, no, no, we are just
very close friends of hers

1305
01:21:21,935 --> 01:21:23,185
and we came to visit her.

1306
01:21:23,185 --> 01:21:24,840
- Oh.

1307
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:28,283
You are welcome, yes, yes, just a minute.

1308
01:21:32,368 --> 01:21:34,466
Come and have a sit.

1309
01:21:34,466 --> 01:21:35,845
Come and sit here and wait for her.

1310
01:21:35,845 --> 01:21:36,678
- Okay.

1311
01:21:36,678 --> 01:21:37,545
As well.

1312
01:21:37,545 --> 01:21:38,878
You are welcome.

1313
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:48,133
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

1314
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:01,090
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1315
01:22:01,090 --> 01:22:02,420
She's my daughter!

1316
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:05,280
- She is mine, she was stolen from me.

1317
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:06,900
- Get out, get out!

1318
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:10,490
- Listen Hadiza, this is the mother.

1319
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:12,720
- You have no right to come in here.

1320
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:16,460
- Please, I beg you, I don't
want to lose her a second time.

1321
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:17,630
I just need to see her face.

1322
01:22:17,630 --> 01:22:19,720
I just want to make sure that she's fine.

1323
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:20,938
That's all I ask, please.

1324
01:22:20,938 --> 01:22:22,510
- Leave my house before
I do something drastic.

1325
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:23,343
Leave!

1326
01:22:23,343 --> 01:22:25,220
- I know it's difficult
for you, but please--

1327
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:26,632
- Leave my house!

1328
01:22:36,700 --> 01:22:37,533
Get out!

1329
01:22:37,533 --> 01:22:38,430
Get out!

1330
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:39,263
- Get up!

1331
01:22:40,806 --> 01:22:42,553
Now leave the house.

1332
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:45,860
Leave the house.

1333
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:47,410
I said leave my house!

1334
01:22:47,410 --> 01:22:49,460
- I'm on my way to the hospital, my dear.

1335
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:53,113
That doctor, their operation,

1336
01:22:53,979 --> 01:22:54,812
they were operating women,

1337
01:22:54,812 --> 01:22:57,380
operating women, operating women,

1338
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,493
that's what they've been saying,

1339
01:22:59,493 --> 01:23:01,560
Even at the village square, she said that,

1340
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,280
she was telling them, I heard.

1341
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,400
She was telling them,

1342
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,730
you know me I don't say what I don't see.

1343
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:09,397
She was telling them
that operation, hospital,

1344
01:23:10,283 --> 01:23:13,885
pregnant hospital, everything hospital.

1345
01:23:42,649 --> 01:23:43,649
- Oh my god.

1346
01:23:45,459 --> 01:23:46,980
- The whole thing is burned down!

1347
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,985
- Who could have been
responsible for this?

1348
01:23:49,985 --> 01:23:50,818
- I don't know!

1349
01:23:50,818 --> 01:23:53,663
- I told you, Dr. Zara,
these people can be crazy.

1350
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:00,853
Come on, come on, come on.

1351
01:24:00,853 --> 01:24:01,686
Doctor Zara.

1352
01:24:03,852 --> 01:24:04,880
- Where are all the people?

1353
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:09,061
- We have to look for them, we
have to look for all of them.

1354
01:24:09,061 --> 01:24:10,661
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

1355
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:15,970
- Why is our children
burning our hospital down?

1356
01:24:15,970 --> 01:24:17,703
The only community hospital,

1357
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:21,310
and these people have come to help us.

1358
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:22,900
Our children are doing it.

1359
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:24,077
Do you know of it?

1360
01:24:24,077 --> 01:24:25,200
It is not us.

1361
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:29,180
- Why is it not you, is your
children who are doing it.

1362
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:31,733
You better go and warn them.

1363
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:33,083
This will not happen again.

1364
01:24:44,252 --> 01:24:45,085
- Who's next?

1365
01:24:45,085 --> 01:24:45,918
- Oh, she's next, she's ready now.

1366
01:24:45,918 --> 01:24:47,857
- Oh, how are we doing?

1367
01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:08,860
- I learnt that some new
doctors came into the village.

1368
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:10,510
- Are you sure they can help her?

1369
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:13,380
You said the other doctor rejected her.

1370
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:17,840
- They rejected her, but
this one is different,

1371
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,570
because Amina, Rabu's
daughter just got well.

1372
01:25:20,570 --> 01:25:23,297
My prayer now is that
Halima agrees to go with me.

1373
01:25:23,297 --> 01:25:25,954
- Let's go and talk to her, let's go.

1374
01:25:28,297 --> 01:25:29,593
Halima!

1375
01:25:29,593 --> 01:25:31,986
Halima, Halima, Halima!

1376
01:25:31,986 --> 01:25:33,870
- Halima!

1377
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:37,124
- Please, go and get the doctor!

1378
01:25:37,124 --> 01:25:38,535
Please, please.

1379
01:25:38,535 --> 01:25:43,535
Oh my god, Halima.

1380
01:25:43,985 --> 01:25:44,818
- Help!

1381
01:25:46,912 --> 01:25:48,185
Help, help!

1382
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:51,154
Hospital, hospital please, help Halima!

1383
01:25:51,154 --> 01:25:52,124
Halima, please!

1384
01:25:52,124 --> 01:25:54,461
Help, help, please, help!

1385
01:25:54,461 --> 01:25:55,878
- Halima, Halima!

1386
01:26:00,547 --> 01:26:01,380
Please.

1387
01:26:02,431 --> 01:26:05,180
- Pick her up, pick her up right how.

1388
01:26:05,180 --> 01:26:06,013
- Halima!

1389
01:26:18,394 --> 01:26:20,523
- Move it, move it!

1390
01:26:20,523 --> 01:26:22,129
Wait there, move it!

1391
01:26:59,537 --> 01:27:02,973
- I'm sorry for abandoning
you when you needed me most.

1392
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:07,170
- I'm not your real mother.

1393
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:11,140
I needed a child so badly,

1394
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:14,983
so when my friend told me she
could help, I had to do it.

1395
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:20,883
She's your mother.

1396
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:24,870
I just met her.

1397
01:27:24,870 --> 01:27:28,053
She came all the way to look for you.

1398
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:35,273
- I'm so sorry.

1399
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:40,153
I didn't know you were still alive.

1400
01:27:41,710 --> 01:27:43,710
I thought you were dead.

1401
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:46,861
But I'll do everything in my power

1402
01:27:46,861 --> 01:27:49,718
to make sure you are okay, okay?

1403
01:27:49,718 --> 01:27:53,218
Everything to make sure that you are well.

1404
01:28:00,276 --> 01:28:01,109
- Mama.

1405
01:28:02,496 --> 01:28:03,329
- No!

1406
01:28:04,833 --> 01:28:06,990
Hold on, let me check your pulse.

1407
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,407
Oh my god, nurse!

1408
01:28:09,416 --> 01:28:10,969
Nurse!

1409
01:28:10,969 --> 01:28:13,347
Oh my god, don't die!

1410
01:28:13,347 --> 01:28:14,427
No!

1411
01:28:14,427 --> 01:28:16,510
- Halima, no, Halima, no!

1412
01:29:01,433 --> 01:29:02,266
- Oh god!

1413
01:29:16,787 --> 01:29:17,745
- Make her suffer!

1414
01:29:17,745 --> 01:29:18,662
Silly girl!

1415
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:35,975
- Why are they marrying them off?

1416
01:29:35,975 --> 01:29:36,808
That's the reason.

1417
01:29:36,808 --> 01:29:38,400
Marry them off, they get
pregnant, and then at the end

1418
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,730
of the day, you throw them
away like piece of trash.

1419
01:29:40,730 --> 01:29:43,220
This needs to stop, and
that's the only thing I want.

1420
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:46,470
The government has to do
something, everyone has to stand up

1421
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:48,640
to make sure that we restore
our healthcare system.

1422
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:49,580
That is all I ask for.

1423
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:51,830
Restore our healthcare system.

1424
01:29:51,830 --> 01:29:52,663
- Well said.

1425
01:29:52,663 --> 01:29:53,496
We do wish you well.

1426
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:56,433
In case you want to
reach out to Doctor Zara

1427
01:29:56,433 --> 01:29:58,307
to support this cause,
you can send your money...

1428
01:29:58,307 --> 01:30:03,176
- Who is this women who is
talking all over the place?

1429
01:30:03,176 --> 01:30:06,289
- Um, I don't, I don't know.

1430
01:30:06,289 --> 01:30:11,289
You don't know?

1431
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:14,783
You were sent a letter and
you did nothing about it?

1432
01:30:16,804 --> 01:30:20,457
- I'm sorry your lordship,
we had other pressing issues.

1433
01:30:22,513 --> 01:30:25,740
- What issue could be more
pressing than this lunatic doctor

1434
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:28,863
who will do anything to
paint this country bad.

1435
01:30:30,730 --> 01:30:34,340
I want you to get to her and let her know

1436
01:30:34,340 --> 01:30:38,263
that the assembly is interested
in this case, whether the

1437
01:30:38,263 --> 01:30:39,513
bill is passed or not,

1438
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:43,480
convince her that we care.

1439
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:48,360
- We are have tried as much
as we can to really help,

1440
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,150
but without enough government
support there is so

1441
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:51,593
little we can do.

1442
01:30:51,593 --> 01:30:54,982
Ah.

1443
01:30:54,982 --> 01:30:56,057
She's everywhere!

1444
01:30:56,057 --> 01:30:57,890
Now get on it!

1445
01:30:57,890 --> 01:30:59,233
- All right, your excellency.

1446
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:06,557
- Yes come to our mother hospital.

1447
01:31:06,557 --> 01:31:07,390
Just come down.

1448
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:13,020
Where are you people from?

1449
01:31:16,235 --> 01:31:17,068
Wait.

1450
01:31:31,492 --> 01:31:32,325
Alex!

1451
01:31:33,492 --> 01:31:34,325
Oh my god.

1452
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:38,010
What are you doing here?

1453
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:40,717
- I thought someone show
come and keep an eye on you.

1454
01:31:40,717 --> 01:31:43,110
- I'm sorry for running
off on you like that.

1455
01:31:43,110 --> 01:31:46,302
- You better not do it again.

1456
01:31:46,302 --> 01:31:48,427
- Thank you so much for coming.

1457
01:31:48,427 --> 01:31:49,622
Thank you.

1458
01:31:57,296 --> 01:31:59,713
Mister speaker!

1459
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:09,543
- Please sit down.

1460
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:20,300
Honorable colleagues,

1461
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:23,410
distinguished ladies and gentlemen,

1462
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:29,520
before we go on, I'd like to

1463
01:32:31,670 --> 01:32:32,610
say that I,

1464
01:32:35,390 --> 01:32:38,420
I have decided to take
over the chairmanship

1465
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:43,420
of this committee on this
issue, because of the gravity,

1466
01:32:46,194 --> 01:32:49,063
and the seriousness that it deserves.

1467
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:55,390
The whole country is asking questions

1468
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:00,513
and we must have the answer to give them.

1469
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:03,153
Dr. Zara Robbins,

1470
01:33:04,090 --> 01:33:05,323
the floor is yours.

1471
01:33:24,610 --> 01:33:27,300
- Thank you, honorable speaker,

1472
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:29,473
for this wonderful opportunity.

1473
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:37,270
I'm standing in front of
you today, not just because

1474
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:43,730
I'm a woman, but first, I am
a human being, and as such

1475
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:48,323
my fundamental human rights
needs to be protected.

1476
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:53,820
The African woman can
be described as the most

1477
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:57,140
endangered species of our world.

1478
01:33:57,140 --> 01:34:02,140
Culture conditions her from
cradle to a life of submission

1479
01:34:02,150 --> 01:34:06,850
and subservience against
her natural inclination for

1480
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:09,930
freedom and self-determination.

1481
01:34:09,930 --> 01:34:14,173
She is at birth a child
to be loved and cared for,

1482
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:19,470
but as she gains age and
consciousness of her environment,

1483
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:24,265
archaic traditions discard
and discount her social value

1484
01:34:24,265 --> 01:34:27,860
to a mere object to be used and given away

1485
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:30,403
to almost anything to almost anybody!

1486
01:34:31,630 --> 01:34:35,213
That I am alive today is a miracle.

1487
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:43,793
You all might wonder what is my story?

1488
01:34:49,290 --> 01:34:54,290
My daughter Halima died
in my arms few days ago

1489
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,163
from fistula.

1490
01:34:58,530 --> 01:35:01,593
She was rushed to the hospital
almost in a state of coma,

1491
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:06,637
the fistula has resulted
in giving her septicemia

1492
01:35:09,024 --> 01:35:09,924
and then she died.

1493
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:15,673
I'm a medical doctor, I
have saved so many lives,

1494
01:35:17,650 --> 01:35:20,183
but the one person that I cared about,

1495
01:35:22,890 --> 01:35:25,130
the one person that I
just wanted for one day

1496
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:28,833
to tell her how much I loved her.

1497
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:32,660
The one person I could
have given everything for

1498
01:35:33,970 --> 01:35:35,623
or could have done anything for,

1499
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:38,123
ended up dying in my arms.

1500
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:45,690
And you know what?

1501
01:35:47,410 --> 01:35:52,030
I am not different from all
these women who go through

1502
01:35:52,030 --> 01:35:54,603
this trauma every day.

1503
01:35:57,610 --> 01:35:58,803
I am just lucky.

1504
01:36:01,510 --> 01:36:05,340
My parents died or rather they
where killed by the rebels

1505
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:07,840
who invaded our village
and killed everyone.

1506
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:08,690
I escaped

1507
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:13,613
and ran to my aunty's house,

1508
01:36:15,830 --> 01:36:17,430
but she wasn't please to see me.

1509
01:36:18,990 --> 01:36:19,830
- Silly girl!

1510
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:22,947
Why are you just coming back, eh?

1511
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:25,740
Can't you talk?

1512
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:29,697
It now takes you forever to
bring water from the backyard.

1513
01:36:29,697 --> 01:36:34,480
Her husband
was nice to me at first,

1514
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:38,751
showered me with gifts,
looked at me in awkward ways

1515
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:42,010
that I did not understand
until eventually.

1516
01:36:42,929 --> 01:36:43,846
Uncle stop!

1517
01:36:45,186 --> 01:36:46,103
No, no, no!

1518
01:36:47,732 --> 01:36:48,649
No, no, no!

1519
01:36:50,268 --> 01:36:51,279
Uncle stop!

1520
01:36:53,544 --> 01:36:55,294
- Why are you crying?

1521
01:36:56,965 --> 01:36:59,060
- Uncle raped me.

1522
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:00,460
- Uncle raped you?

1523
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:02,567
What are you talking about?

1524
01:37:03,413 --> 01:37:04,580
Hear this, evil child.

1525
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:06,923
After you have killed
your parents, now you want

1526
01:37:06,923 --> 01:37:08,550
to destroy my home?

1527
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:09,383
God forbid!

1528
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:12,573
Look at your mouth, rape?

1529
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:16,210
How do you know what rape is?

1530
01:37:16,210 --> 01:37:18,894
Huh, Zara you cannot live in
this house with me any longer.

1531
01:37:20,370 --> 01:37:22,830
I said go, go, you must go!

1532
01:37:22,830 --> 01:37:24,780
My aunty had to chase me away.

1533
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:27,973
I found myself on the streets.

1534
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:30,403
I was hawking

1535
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:33,770
and then two men kidnapped me

1536
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:38,893
and took me to a woman called Madam Kojo.

1537
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:43,550
Madam Kojo, who felt she
owned me and could do anything

1538
01:37:43,550 --> 01:37:47,363
with me, forced me into prostitution.

1539
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:53,190
And it was at that point
that I realized that

1540
01:37:53,190 --> 01:37:54,790
I was carrying my uncle's child.

1541
01:37:57,970 --> 01:38:00,720
But Madam Kojo had her plans.

1542
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:02,350
She had other plans.

1543
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:04,623
She lied to me that my baby died.

1544
01:38:04,623 --> 01:38:05,456
My baby!

1545
01:38:08,383 --> 01:38:11,541
And then I developed fistula.

1546
01:38:11,541 --> 01:38:12,374
- What?

1547
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:18,623
- Not again.

1548
01:38:18,623 --> 01:38:19,456
- What is it?

1549
01:38:19,456 --> 01:38:21,679
Must you do this every day?

1550
01:38:21,679 --> 01:38:23,258
- How can you do this kind of a thing?

1551
01:38:23,258 --> 01:38:24,673
Look at my body.

1552
01:38:24,673 --> 01:38:26,950
I can't take this anymore.

1553
01:38:26,950 --> 01:38:28,850
- Off to the witch who did this house.

1554
01:38:33,799 --> 01:38:34,632
Go on!

1555
01:38:36,830 --> 01:38:39,580
- Which kind of evil child is this?

1556
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:41,563
From one problem to the other.

1557
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:44,193
Now you are born,

1558
01:38:45,690 --> 01:38:50,313
now your pikin' die, now
you still do piss for house,

1559
01:38:51,730 --> 01:38:52,813
witchcraft.

1560
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:57,238
Please return to wherever
they brought you from.

1561
01:38:57,238 --> 01:39:00,050
This witchcraft is not
good for my business.

1562
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:02,549
Return, I beg leave my house.

1563
01:39:02,549 --> 01:39:04,120
Leave my house now!

1564
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:05,550
The whole house is smelling.

1565
01:39:05,550 --> 01:39:08,363
- I felt so ashamed that I meant nothing.

1566
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:13,633
I believed everything my aunty
told me, that I was evil,

1567
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:20,200
that I killed my parents, that
I allowed my uncle rape me,

1568
01:39:21,683 --> 01:39:24,313
that everything happened
to me that I deserved,

1569
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,147
that I'm such a horrible person.

1570
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:30,730
But you know what?

1571
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:36,250
The death of my daughter
made me realize that no!

1572
01:39:36,250 --> 01:39:37,083
I don't.

1573
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:39,033
I don't deserve it,

1574
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:44,890
I deserve to be happy, I
deserve to be protected.

1575
01:39:44,890 --> 01:39:46,493
I deserved to be loved.

1576
01:39:48,495 --> 01:39:50,350
Just that I wish I could show the love

1577
01:39:50,350 --> 01:39:52,860
that I got from my adopted
mother to my daughter,

1578
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:56,510
who found me on the streets
repaired me of fistula

1579
01:39:56,510 --> 01:39:58,563
and then changed my life.

1580
01:40:01,070 --> 01:40:03,400
Today I stand before you

1581
01:40:04,470 --> 01:40:05,740
to speak for the rights

1582
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:08,273
and welfare of the daughters of Africa,

1583
01:40:09,410 --> 01:40:11,520
to speak against their abuse and reduction

1584
01:40:12,550 --> 01:40:14,370
to the status of material gifts.

1585
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:15,893
Especially at a tender age.

1586
01:40:17,070 --> 01:40:20,920
The practice of underaged
marriage, female circumcision,

1587
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:23,590
lack of access to medical
care and education

1588
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:25,673
is a gross abuse of womanhood.

1589
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:32,380
I insist that the final and
most decisive anti-fistula

1590
01:40:32,530 --> 01:40:35,070
effort should commence now.

1591
01:40:35,070 --> 01:40:39,040
Time has come for us to
put a stop to this menace.

1592
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,650
Time has come for us to save ourselves

1593
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:44,560
from this crippling scourge.

1594
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,843
We need to enforce the Child Right Act.

1595
01:40:48,816 --> 01:40:51,060
We need to pass the national health bill,

1596
01:40:51,060 --> 01:40:54,900
create an agency for the
eradication of Fistula

1597
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:59,283
in order to achieve our
millennium developmental goals.

1598
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:02,493
And in all,

1599
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:07,423
I beg you, please,

1600
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:10,913
let these young girls
have their childhood,

1601
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:15,730
because when it is taken away from them,

1602
01:41:15,730 --> 01:41:17,500
you can never get it back.

1603
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:25,130
And in all of this today.

1604
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:29,133
I confront my abuser,

1605
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:33,003
who amazingly is one of you.

1606
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,202
Honorable Musa Abudullahi.

1607
01:41:40,579 --> 01:41:42,760
I ask the honorable assembly
not only to grant me

1608
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:46,250
the wishes of these women,
but also bring to judgment

1609
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:49,100
to Honorable Musa for the
crime he committed against

1610
01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:52,283
a young girl many years ago.

1611
01:42:02,161 --> 01:42:03,411
- Order! Order!

1612
01:42:46,588 --> 01:42:49,200
- It's with pleasure that
we unveil this center

1613
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:52,780
dedicated to Halima, the little
girl that died of fistula.

1614
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:54,540
May God rest her soul.

1615
01:42:54,540 --> 01:42:57,110
I hereby declare the
official laying foundation

1616
01:42:57,110 --> 01:43:01,872
of Halima Fistula Hospital
and School of Education open.

1617
01:43:05,430 --> 01:43:06,263
- Thank you so much.

1618
01:43:06,263 --> 01:43:08,096
- Thank you very much.
