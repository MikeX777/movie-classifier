1
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,433
I've talk a lot about her

2
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,478
You might be disappointed

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,868
You must like her

4
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,999
I like her...

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,992
...everyone courted her
here at the beach...

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,953
...she ignored everyone

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,478
They all came for her
graduation

8
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,313
We went everywhere
to look for lights

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,710
We lit them

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,234
all over the countryside

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,749
...everywhere...

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,593
She was happy
when she saw them

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,678
...I'd never seen her
that happy

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,716
What did she do?

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,360
She said: "Don't ever
put them out"

16
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,796
Go ahead

17
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,516
My heavens

18
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,756
You didn't forget...

19
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,917
Forget?

20
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,838
...just think, it's
exactly 10 years

21
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,275
That's right, come

22
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,792
My son is here...
can he come?

23
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,155
Of course...

24
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,156
I'm coming

25
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,959
I've got large pants

26
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,150
My son Nicola...
grown, huh?

27
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,836
- Yes...
- You remember him smaller

28
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,078
If you look around...

29
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,839
...you'll see weeds
everywhere

30
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,876
See the weeds?

31
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,635
Lots of cracks?

32
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,314
- Look at all those cracks...
- And the shutters?

33
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,279
Let's hurry and
go to the beach

34
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,754
...The professor is there...

35
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,308
He didn't want me
to call you

36
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,958
The people for
the party are here

37
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,238
...are we disturbing you?

38
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,196
Do you remember Vanni,
the cook's son?

39
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,710
Can you give us an indication
or shall I take care of it?

40
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,560
You take care of it

41
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,235
Say goodbye and follow me

42
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,077
Goodbye...

43
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,432
First the Germans arrived,
then the refugees

44
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,953
Now the vacationers

45
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,431
...it's no man's land. Do
you remember how it was?

46
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,550
- And my graduation party?
- Yes...

47
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,154
And the meal?

48
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,197
My mother prepared it

49
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,194
I'd like to see everything
as it was

50
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,278
I slept in that room there

51
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,236
From the walls to the sofas
everything as it was

52
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,233
We're not organized

53
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,678
...I've changed jobs

54
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,228
I thought it would be

55
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,278
a little garden
refreshment party

56
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,035
My daughter is graduating
with an A average!

57
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,678
She's the youngest
in her class

58
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,473
Do you know what that means
for her father and myself

59
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,189
- to live such a moment?!
- We need carpenters,

60
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,160
upholsterers and
bricklayers here

61
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,948
...the war has just finished
and everything is missing

62
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,791
Don't talk to me about costs!

63
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,838
We can't find anything

64
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,472
The professor was against
my calling you

65
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,313
You expect us to think
of everything

66
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,153
...I now have a pasta
factory...

67
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,708
My son is learning now

68
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,951
What did one do before?

69
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,793
Explain that to your son, huh?

70
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,032
If one had to change a faucet

71
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,953
...he'd call the plumber

72
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,952
No...

73
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,998
...he'd roll his sleeves up.

74
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,398
And instead he's making
cream puffs

75
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,793
I had the professor
get up at six

76
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,118
I made him cancel his
appointments and...

77
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,590
...come here for nothing

78
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,711
- It's not our fault
...at all

79
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,797
Your attitude and that of
your son confirms that

80
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,839
If I'd called Silvano,

81
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,037
he'd already be painting

82
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,437
- But he's a lifeguard
- Silvano can do everything

83
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,518
What did you study?

84
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,629
A little of everything

85
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,118
Do you know what
a "degree" is?

86
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,069
Do you know what
graduation means?

87
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,519
Yes...

88
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,075
Well then, explain
it to your father

89
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,959
Graduation means...

90
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,513
...having done well
in school

91
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,390
...and then...

92
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,435
I don't know...

93
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,952
- What should we do?
- Everything!

94
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,632
Did she convince us or
did we convince her?

95
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,156
She convinced us

96
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,237
- How did it go?
- So, so...

97
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,357
Wear a nice English suit

98
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,000
Go get undressed

99
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,558
Give me back my watch

100
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,950
You're downtrodden

101
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,952
No, she cornered us

102
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,439
How was the meeting
after so many years?

103
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,189
She didn't even ask me
how I was

104
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,988
This has to be fixed,
that has to be painted

105
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,078
That's what she said

106
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,118
Did you talk about the kiss?

107
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,196
No...

108
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,840
Does she know about
your factory?

109
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,037
Yes, but... Are the shoes
mine or yours?

110
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,038
Wear something classic

111
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,953
on our next meeting

112
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,154
- Are you finished?
- Yes!

113
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,758
Tie...

114
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,593
...shoes... shirt...

115
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,999
...pants... jacket... and pen

116
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,959
You put these on,
Giorgini...

117
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,550
Giorgini, you're beautiful

118
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,631
...a love...

119
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,118
The "cannoli" burned

120
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,351
- And the cream?
- That's been saved

121
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,953
It's a little bitter

122
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,998
The children is summer
camps eat them

123
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,273
Father be more careful.
Nicola and I are busy

124
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,229
They've come
to collect the rent

125
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,954
You go deliver

126
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,953
- II've got to see your mother
- Say hello for me

127
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,954
- It's me
- I see him

128
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,878
Everything is going well

129
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,515
Mrs. Franchi
wants me with her

130
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,277
Did she come back? Have
you already seen each other?

131
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,476
This morning

132
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,436
The worse they treat you
the more you chase them...

133
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,952
She's never treated
me badly

134
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,712
I must prepare
the whole house

135
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,797
She only trust me and
doesn't talk about prices

136
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,073
Did you accept?

137
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,072
Yes, she always pays

138
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,430
And now...

139
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,675
Take a shower

140
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,118
He's a pig... if you
knew what he tells me

141
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,394
You'll never change

142
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,078
- I've never liked you
- You either

143
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,118
But you used to take me
behind the shed

144
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,759
Why did you marry me?

145
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,118
Because of my father

146
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,269
I've come for those two
you adopted

147
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,759
- One works
- And the other?

148
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,877
- Steals?
- He's getting on

149
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,150
Why did you adopt
those children?

150
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,070
I like them

151
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,438
You had one and
you left him with me

152
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,159
He was too stupid... like you

153
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,233
...he would have grieved me

154
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,031
I'll make a carreer
for Nicola!

155
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,236
Send those two to work for me

156
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,870
The bread comes out good
if the ingredients are good

157
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,396
...and even the day
to come is good

158
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,115
How did it come out?

159
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,797
Good.

160
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,440
We must take that work

161
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,556
I don't agree

162
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,918
They live with your mother

163
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,078
...they are only workers

164
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,278
They must respect you

165
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,149
Are you orphans?

166
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,959
Get on and be quiet

167
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,278
Take the tools

168
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,069
- What are your names?
- Davide e Dario.

169
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,190
I've been told...

170
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,590
that one of you is a smart
aleck... not with me

171
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,788
- Clear?
- Yes...

172
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,959
My son Nicola.
Shake hands

173
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,953
It's rusty

174
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,556
Shall I do it?

175
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,234
Do you know how?

176
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,596
Done

177
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,189
Let's close

178
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,796
No one must enter here

179
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,029
Did you see the weeds?

180
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,877
- See the windows?
- And the shutters?

181
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,955
Who is there?

182
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,349
Who should work?

183
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,876
You...

184
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,318
- Who are you?
- Vacationers!

185
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,798
Vacationers... we
always come here

186
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,193
We're not refugees

187
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,239
The Latin professor
is here for her

188
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,194
Where did you get
the stuff?

189
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,194
Inside...

190
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,394
- How did you get in?
- From the beach

191
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,677
My father will take
care of them

192
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,354
This is a private property

193
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,559
We must work

194
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,279
If the owner comes,
she might fire us

195
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,318
Where shall we go
for the weekend?

196
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,478
- I don't know...
- You don't know?!

197
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,238
Well then, why did
we fight this war?

198
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,278
To have the owners
come back?

199
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,272
- And where will we go?
- There's the beach

200
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,955
Oh! We stay in the desert...

201
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,873
and you here living it up!

202
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,953
Don't sent them away...

203
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,838
Finish eating and then leave

204
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,396
Thank you...

205
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,429
Hurry...

206
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,597
- Let's start from here
- Move

207
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,154
Aren't you changing?

208
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,358
We'll bring everything inside

209
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,638
Let's haul everything
on the cart

210
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,192
Porelli...

211
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,874
...a phone call...

212
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,235
...in an hour from Bologna...

213
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,799
What are you doing here?

214
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,838
I'm waiting for a phone call

215
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,515
For you

216
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,911
Hello?

217
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,954
I can't hear

218
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,349
It's me

219
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,276
Madam...

220
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,115
- How is the work?
- I had to hire

221
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,112
some technicians...
they're not expensive

222
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,112
I'm coming Saturday

223
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,795
...my daughter
is arriving today

224
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,075
Alright

225
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,679
Madaam, may I ask you
a question?

226
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,791
10 years ago, the day
war was declared

227
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,399
...do you remember
what happened?

228
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,553
...I always think
about it and...

229
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,958
- Sir...
- I'm talking!

230
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,357
- With who?
- They've already hung up

231
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,068
- Vanni!
- Sandra!

232
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,960
...it's the daughter...

233
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,955
You've become a woman

234
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,398
They are my friends

235
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,274
They're going to help me
organize the party

236
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,113
He's the son
of the cook

237
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,156
How is it going?

238
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,516
- Fine...
- My friends are curious

239
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,950
Will you be on time?

240
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,913
- Do you need a hand?
- Lf necessary,

241
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,589
we'll even work
during the night

242
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,638
Will they pull out
these weeds?

243
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,632
Of course!

244
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,552
- And the buffet?
- I'd put it under the porch

245
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,313
Who will prepare it?

246
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,392
Them?! Are they
capable of it?

247
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,119
My mother trusts them.
She's known them a long time

248
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,950
The party will be wonderful!

249
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,598
...my father is an expert...

250
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,353
- What do you do?
- In the pastry business

251
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,069
I'm just beginning

252
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,879
I'm sorry about
this new work

253
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,520
It's an experience

254
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,195
- Are you from Bologna?
- Yes... how can you tell?

255
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,830
You seem presumptuous
but actually...

256
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,356
...you're not at all...
like us...

257
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,159
Is he bothering you?

258
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,915
- We chatted
- Keep on working

259
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,960
- He's naive
- No...

260
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,600
He is for his age

261
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,713
...I'm fond of him
because he's that way

262
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,959
I'm grateful to him...

263
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,149
...for being that way

264
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,317
- Are you courting her?
- I'm trying...

265
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,598
- I've got a plan
- What?

266
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,513
To conquer her!

267
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,108
More cakes?!

268
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,714
I don't have meat

269
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,678
Did grandfather
make them?

270
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,033
...They're rancid...
- They taste like fish

271
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,958
- Terrible?
- Lf you close your eyes

272
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,954
they're like fried soles

273
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,756
Try it...

274
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,436
Taste it?

275
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,357
Whatch out... for the bones

276
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,870
- Let's hope Sandra passes
- Of course

277
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,079
I'm very hungry

278
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,113
Will she have
a good average?

279
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,953
- At least a B
- Of course

280
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,790
We have children and cannot
sleep away from home

281
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,311
My sister lives with her
family in Bologna

282
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,476
...we have a bathroom
there... they don't...

283
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,037
...when we're not there,
they wash

284
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,756
That's how we're organized

285
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,477
We thought you'd
leave at dusk

286
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,472
...and we'd come over...

287
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,358
I't's night already and
the children are tired

288
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,715
Alright

289
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,759
- You can stay here
- It's not anything special

290
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,238
Don't be difficult

291
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,078
Bring the mattresses...
only for the children

292
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,310
- And Dario?
- He's speaking outside

293
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,960
Let's call him

294
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,039
II don't think he'll come

295
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,515
I won't pay him

296
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,513
Our mother really
embarasses us

297
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,034
I sslept in a cemetery

298
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,277
Sleeping like this...

299
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,313
...all together like refugees

300
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,477
...just to show that we
go on vacation too

301
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,074
Look here

302
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,831
It's a list of new things

303
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,199
- Who has it?
- As long as you order,

304
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,192
I'll take care of getting it

305
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,392
...it will take
a few days but...

306
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,472
...if your family
is interested

307
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,949
What do you do here?

308
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,952
I work for that
big-nosed man

309
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,954
...the party for a...

310
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,112
I don't know her

311
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,158
but if you want,
I can have you invited

312
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,638
- See you tomorrow
- II can't

313
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,673
- Why?
- I'm busy

314
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,399
If you don't come,
then just disappear

315
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,948
- And the money?
- You'll get it at the end

316
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,678
- I'll think about it
- Think about it

317
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,319
- How is it going?
- You leave me here alone!

318
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,075
- Go to bed
- Goodnight!

319
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,033
You go to bed too

320
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,271
You've changed
since that kiss

321
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,635
Go to bed

322
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,998
Sandra... is it you?

323
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,872
- Yes, it's me
- I thought...

324
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,558
...it was my father

325
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,679
Weren't you busy
this morning?

326
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,789
Put everything back

327
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,758
Sorry I'm late

328
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,599
...I have a radio...

329
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,278
Look for a song

330
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,433
You made it, huh?
It was easy...

331
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,270
- Is my wife here?
- I haven't seen her

332
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:30,515
My niece would like
to see the works

333
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,475
...without being noticed...
Who is inside?

334
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,633
- IMy technicians
- Send them on the beach

335
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,834
- Now?!
- Now...

336
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,555
Alright...

337
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,472
Hurry up!

338
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,630
Vai, muoviti!

339
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,438
The collaborators are
in the water

340
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,554
While I check the work,
you ceck the car

341
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,955
- Are you staying tonight?
- Yes...

342
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,510
My father's always been
madly in love with her

343
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,433
She doesn't know

344
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,432
Once there had been a
relationship between them

345
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,198
Continue

346
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,671
She must have gone with
him and he went crazy

347
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,270
- You're behind
- A little...

348
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,117
Don't tell my wife I came

349
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,149
There are some bills

350
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,240
Are we spending too much?

351
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,278
I advanced everything

352
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,318
...I have no more cash
- Write an account

353
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,790
and my wife will stop by

354
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,836
- I've already written one
- Write some more

355
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,194
He's got a lover!

356
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,953
That swine betrays her!

357
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,753
That way you've got
some hope!

358
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,753
Forget it...
send me those two

359
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,431
I'm writing down the hours
you worked, not to be wrong...

360
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,437
- For you...
- What is it?

361
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,440
The receipt for your hours

362
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,830
- What shall I do with it?
- Keep it

363
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,999
...in the end you'll have
a nice boundle

364
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,231
- Not bad
- Send Dario over

365
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,797
I know...

366
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,878
...why you want
to look good...

367
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,714
because of what
happened before the war

368
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,233
- On June 10, 1940
- I didn't know that

369
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,352
Right here... in this room

370
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,519
...June 10, in 1940
at six o' clock

371
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,433
I was bringing her some tea...

372
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,593
...She jumped on top of me
and said: "We're at war!"

373
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,513
And she...

374
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,999
Kissed me here...

375
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,874
...here... I've been thinking
of that kiss...

376
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,748
ever since

377
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,518
she could have given it to
her husband, to her daughter

378
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,957
...but no...

379
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,716
She gave it to me

380
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,993
I didn't separate from
my wife for that

381
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:08,954
I know

382
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,840
there's a big age difference
between ujs

383
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,354
but in life, every one
has a right

384
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,432
...to live a lovely obsession
- A dream

385
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,953
And now she acts as
if nothing happened

386
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,716
...I don't know
what to do

387
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,558
What will you do with
the money you earn?

388
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,952
I'll set up a chewing gum
factory

389
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,431
- How do you make it?
- You take these and cut them

390
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,955
And cook them with water
vapor and sugar

391
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,350
When they're cooked,
you wrap and sell them

392
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,669
But it's poisonous!

393
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,355
No, that's how
the Americans make it

394
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,556
Make a bubble

395
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,590
I can't

396
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,677
Come on, let's do something

397
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,470
Are you crazy?
The Latin professor is here

398
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,396
Sleep...

399
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,595
Dario stopped here.
He had things to do

400
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,515
Go and call him

401
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,389
- He's with a girl
- Your mother gave me

402
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,597
two orphans, not only one

403
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,949
- Where is Dario?
- On the beach

404
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,791
- Does your father know?
- Of course

405
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,755
Dario, you know I have
to take you back home?

406
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,196
I'll go by myself

407
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,472
What where you
talking about?

408
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,516
We were kissing

409
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,953
You'll have one next year

410
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,352
- What?
- A new radio

411
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,348
- Well?
- Let's go

412
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,995
Sandra, bring us
a bottle of water

413
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,755
...They're thirsty...

414
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,912
Sandra's professor

415
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,039
Don Emilio.

416
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,596
Water

417
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,793
We were expecting
you yesterday

418
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,519
Thieves broke into
Nando's store

419
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,751
All the radios

420
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,674
Don Emilio, if you want
to change, go inside

421
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,798
I'll fix you a cold drink

422
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,279
Let's go on the beach.
Here with these workers...

423
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,954
It will be completely
different

424
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,068
Don Emilio, come
dive into the water!

425
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,556
Give the radio back!

426
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,436
Understand?

427
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,191
To the water!!

428
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,830
Help!

429
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,431
- You're way ahead
- We're doing alright

430
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,715
Please be seated

431
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,350
Roberta, do you want
to freshen up?

432
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,354
- Who is he?
- A lawyer...

433
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,629
- Who can it be?
- Maybe a policeman...

434
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,838
Will you bring
the radio back?

435
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,672
- How does it look??
- Fine!

436
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,517
...as long as it's sunny,
we can film exteriors

437
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,633
Shall we go?

438
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,917
The appointment is
for Next Saturday

439
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,512
See you Saturday.

440
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:13,510
He'll film the party

441
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,076
He's a lawyer but
filming is his hobby

442
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,552
Last year he did a film
on me... in the snow

443
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,315
It will participate in
some competitions

444
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,270
See you Sunday

445
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,475
The expenses

446
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:04,517
This is the list of what
is left to do

447
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,117
- An orchestra?!
- There will be a tenor

448
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,716
among the guests...
we need an orchestra

449
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,428
I'm here alone

450
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,273
my collaborators only
have good will

451
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:28,912
I've advanced everything.
I've spent alla my money

452
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,238
...and now I've had it...

453
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,279
You're a little tired

454
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,358
...that's why I come
to see you

455
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,198
Shall we go inside a bit?

456
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,030
Close the door

457
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,274
Here's an installment

458
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,556
It doesn't matter

459
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,359
- You want them all together?
- Yes...

460
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,956
...all of it at the end
- Why?

461
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,637
Before the war...

462
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,199
...many things happened
and some I can't remember

463
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,593
but that afternoon...

464
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:54,519
...when war broke out...

465
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,677
I kissed you

466
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,877
I didn't remember well.
You said: "We're at war!"

467
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,872
Then I kissed you

468
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,198
Is he good looking?

469
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,078
Who, the lawyer?

470
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,439
He's facinating. Too bad
he's got that idiot wife

471
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,838
Why did you ask me
about that kiss?

472
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,638
To know where I stand

473
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,678
- Here he is!
- Hadn't he left?

474
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:20,076
One of these days the two of
us must talk about everything

475
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,198
Mother, we're here!

476
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,113
- Who?
- The two orphans!

477
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,117
Shall I take the radio back?

478
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,949
No, I'll do it

479
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,308
We really risked...

480
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,188
Finally...

481
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,158
Ladies should
remain deated

482
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,073
- Some tea?
- In a restaurant?!

483
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,877
- Some tea
- And you?

484
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,758
Nothing

485
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,231
Both of the boys steal

486
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,357
- I didn't know...
- I've taken them

487
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,711
and I'll keep them...
but you should know

488
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,598
Is that all you wanted?

489
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,469
I must tell you...

490
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,353
...something personal...
- Are you afraid of me?

491
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,318
That money...

492
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:07,393
What for?

493
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,948
I need a loan

494
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:23,596
- How did it go?
- Fine

495
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,235
We must prepare the party

496
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,676
Nicola must not be like us

497
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,752
...he should make
new acquaintences

498
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,590
You'll ruin him besides
ruining yourself

499
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:46,319
- What are you saying?
- You ended a marriage for that

500
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,238
...now the company

501
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:55,235
You made me marry
someone I didn't like

502
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,279
This is the menu

503
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,240
The lady is not responsable

504
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:04,756
People do not always
fall in love immediately

505
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,276
...at times she's in love
and he isn't

506
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,113
But not with you

507
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,800
Isn't it? Not with me?

508
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,958
It's just an advance

509
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,078
I want to decide the menu

510
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,198
Isn't Sandra coming?

511
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,953
You like it?

512
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,998
- You like it?
- We'll be a nice quartet

513
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,955
...you with her and
me with the daughter

514
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:07,350
How do you dream
these idiocies up?

515
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:12,550
At night... I'm happy
only if you are

516
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,713
I can picture the four
of us in a nice car

517
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,109
Dario didn't lose
time with her

518
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,432
They're going together

519
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,160
That's how you do it,
according to him

520
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,789
You don't know how
to treat women

521
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,433
Be careful how you paint

522
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,353
Be more courageous

523
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,910
...don't do anything stupid

524
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,838
- You talk to her
- No...

525
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,434
I'll stay outside

526
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,359
I'm a friend...

527
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,558
...Sandra...

528
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,360
I'm Nicola Porelli

529
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:02,232
The pastry man on the beach

530
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,877
It's for the orchestra

531
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,949
They're kids from here.
They imitate American music

532
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,358
...I don't know
if you like these

533
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,479
...yes, American records

534
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,953
- Excuse me...
- How are you

535
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,952
How are you?!

536
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,516
We're expecting you

537
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,433
We're expecting you

538
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,958
- You didn't have
the courage, huh?

539
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,550
She speaks
in that certain way...

540
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,559
Clear?

541
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,068
They imitate American
music... perfectly

542
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,553
This is a good orchestra?

543
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,313
Maybe

544
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:54,317
Can you play it all?

545
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,755
We will later

546
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,354
Are you free Saturday?

547
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,194
Yes, also Sunday,
Monday and Tuesday

548
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,953
I'm busy in Thursday

549
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:10,716
There will be food...
but learn how to play

550
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:15,319
- Nobody is to wear a T-shirt
- He imitates a horse well

551
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,120
See you Saturday

552
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:30,953
The whole piece, ok?

553
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,631
He organized the party

554
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,359
He got fired from the hotel

555
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,955
- I quit
- Thet pressed charges

556
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,320
There'll be 70 people

557
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,356
- Stand up dinner?
- Yes

558
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,079
- How many plates?
- Tarts, cakes, etc...

559
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,118
- A family gathering
- I was told

560
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:18,199
...you have plates
and glasses

561
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,631
forks and spoons

562
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,111
I also have
towels and sheets

563
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,951
You're one of us

564
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,718
Unload boys

565
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,756
The garden

566
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,958
It's modest

567
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,478
The buffet will go
under the porch

568
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,755
...a few tables there...

569
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,397
- We're leaving tomorrow
- About time...

570
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,678
My daughter ran away

571
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,592
...She cried all night...
what a terrible character

572
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,948
She's coming to the party

573
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,838
- She's crazy!
- She said she'd been invited

574
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:45,948
We want to see
if she comes

575
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,149
...my husband will stay...

576
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,278
We are going back

577
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,358
If you don't mind,
They will stay

578
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,399
I do mind!

579
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,116
Great help!

580
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,670
Guess who's here?

581
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,189
Her!

582
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,632
That's marvelous!
Nice work!

583
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,198
Mother is sleeping here
tomorrow night

584
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,712
My son found an orchestra

585
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,437
Bring up the suitcases

586
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,398
- Excuse me...
- Put them over there

587
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,709
Let's arrange the presents

588
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,436
- Such nice presents...
- Why didn't you stay there?

589
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:49,592
They're all girls talking
with each other

590
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,517
So what?

591
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,956
...you could have
stopped to talk

592
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,878
...I don't think
she likes you

593
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:07,308
I'd like you to make
friends like them

594
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,118
...they're well
educated people

595
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,958
If a person speaks well

596
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,278
...they already like them

597
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,798
You must get used
to it... learn

598
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,911
- Shall I go back up?
- Go ahead

599
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,358
Shall I talk to her?

600
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,957
- Try
- And say what?

601
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,199
Something interesting

602
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:00,518
Who is it? Come in!

603
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,038
- How do I look?
- Very well

604
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,794
- What's your name?
- Nicola!

605
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:13,236
We finished the works today

606
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:15,556
Sit down...

607
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:23,919
This is Lucia, Marisa
and Alessandra

608
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,950
- Are you sleeping here?
- No...

609
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,954
...we're catching
the 8 o'clock train

610
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,551
Go out... I must
try my dress on

611
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,475
You stay

612
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:51,357
I'm not ashamed of men

613
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,958
You must be used to see
a woman undress

614
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,396
Well...

615
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,110
Where's my son?

616
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,953
Is he saying idiocies?

617
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:26,190
- No...
- Sure?

618
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,875
You're son is taking
us to the station

619
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,355
- Nicola...
- What's the matter?

620
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,949
- Are you alright?
- Of course I'm alright

621
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,628
Are you happy?

622
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,431
How did it go?
Tell me

623
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:18,116
She got undressed and wanted
me to tell her nice things

624
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:21,677
But her girlfriends
were behind the door

625
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,513
I didn't say anything
aand she got mad

626
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:29,230
She said she's engaged

627
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:32,278
She apologized
at the station

628
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,432
Did that hurt you?

629
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,432
She wasn't so pretty
undressed

630
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,958
You've got to look
good today, father

631
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,635
I feel fine

632
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,029
- And you?
- Very well

633
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,878
How did the bread
come out?

634
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,958
- Perfect
- Good sign...

635
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,679
...things will go well today

636
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,990
Hurry...

637
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,992
Thanks for the hospitality

638
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:42,396
Here we are

639
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,034
- What can you do?
- She goes to school

640
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,509
- . And reads and writes
- And you?

641
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,076
I'm a ticket vendor

642
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:58,311
You clean the bathroom
and you iron the tablecloths

643
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:14,115
Are you happy "she"is here?

644
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,358
Be careful, the stuff
is itemized

645
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:23,679
- What is your present?
- I've done enough

646
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,918
Quality merchandize

647
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,673
...Honestly come by...

648
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,075
Even the dogs:
Poodles, setters...

649
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:46,473
They're difficult to find

650
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:56,479
Can you find colored
lights, like in a fair?

651
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,436
Yes

652
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,633
Like those of the past

653
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,514
- What's your name?
- Sandra

654
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,199
Same as the party girl

655
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,398
- Do you like Dario?
- Yes

656
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,792
- Why?
- He's handsome

657
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,953
So are you

658
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,069
How will the party be?

659
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,958
After all you've done

660
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:06,239
it will be marvelous

661
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,679
Sandra's party

662
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,954
Where is the kitchen?

663
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,799
What have you done?

664
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,276
They don't burn?

665
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,431
I feel a nice warmth

666
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,158
Turn them off.
It's a surprise

667
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,514
It's a little modern.
I don't know

668
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:55,309
- if I can get used to it
- Don't be difficult

669
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:22,799
- What's written on it?
- "II Castello" restaurant

670
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,951
- And here?
- "Pensione Corallo"

671
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:37,160
It's stuff from...

672
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:40,550
If you want I'll take it all away

673
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,874
He's the head waiter.
It's all his

674
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:51,992
- Read
- "II Capriolo" restaurant

675
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,398
Couldn't you find
something else?

676
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,552
If you want I'll leave and

677
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:03,473
- take everything away
- No...

678
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:30,598
Take the writing off
the plates with acid

679
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,678
- Alright, madam
- Madam...

680
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,274
...these are my collaborators

681
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:41,750
Melloni, the head waiter:
Davide, Dario, the assistants

682
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,798
Mr Zucchi, his daughter,

683
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,395
- the father, my son...
- That's all

684
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:02,038
I couldn't introduce her

685
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:05,670
She's a beautiful,
sentimental woman

686
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,399
It's not true!

687
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:13,519
You're in agreement with
her! You've always lied!

688
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,872
She's a liar and a viper!

689
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,474
You always want
to be right!

690
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,711
The last word
is always yours!

691
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,952
You shouldn't have trusted
people like that. I told you!

692
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,798
Don't change the subject.
That's not the problem!

693
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:36,394
You're a liar!

694
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,631
You're stingy!

695
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:43,234
She found everything out

696
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:50,149
One can never disturb
you. You're a worm

697
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,429
What are you doing here?

698
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,359
Nothing...

699
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,953
Go back to work

700
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,275
- Close the door
- With me inside?

701
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,237
Yes...

702
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,155
She didn't graduate

703
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:24,632
She didn't graduate

704
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,154
What?

705
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,519
She said that
during the war

706
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,830
some documents were lost

707
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:38,038
She swore to have passed
the exams...

708
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,839
but it wasn't true

709
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:44,153
It must be some mistake

710
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:47,755
No... she hoped nobody
would find out

711
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:52,909
- What now?
- The guests will come...

712
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,958
and it will be a tragedy

713
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,673
I don't feel like
cancelling it

714
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,513
and I say this also for you

715
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:07,157
For me?

716
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:11,753
My husband says the party
has been poorly organized

717
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,560
I wanted...

718
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,754
something that
resembled my party...

719
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,149
Swear that you won't
tell anyone

720
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,953
- I swear it
- Are you fond of me?

721
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:36,200
You've always been faithful

722
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,278
You kissed me 10 years ago

723
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:43,638
...it was something important...

724
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:47,113
Really? I kissed you?

725
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,753
Are you crazy?

726
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:01,748
...that's ridiculous...

727
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,948
Who cares

728
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,274
What are we wearing?

729
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,910
We'll rent the clothes

730
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,549
You must be tired...
go to bed

731
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,868
- And the black pants?
- Women look at men

732
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,750
from the waist up

733
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,876
...Sure?
- Yes

734
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,436
Everyone go away.
I must film the titles

735
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,476
Camera, action

736
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:08,831
Go away. I must
film the arrival scene!

737
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:14,958
Camera!

738
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,951
Action!

739
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,756
Applaud

740
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,516
Beautiful

741
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,433
Did you iron my dress?

742
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,159
Madame will come
down shortly

743
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,069
They didn't give her...

744
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,190
...the diploma

745
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:56,751
She had forged the votes
on the register

746
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,157
Some guests have
already arrived

747
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:31,989
They know, huh?

748
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,959
The professor is coming
right away

749
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,674
And you?

750
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,272
Has my daughter
come down?

751
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,072
There was a surprise
for you

752
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,955
You don't have
black pants?

753
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:34,758
You're mother
is not coming

754
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,957
because she's ashamed

755
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,317
Go up and smile

756
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,839
Action!

757
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:00,109
Watch the steps!

758
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,753
Thank you for coming

759
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,833
You can start playing

760
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,960
Like it?

761
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:35,510
- Is it ready?
- Almost

762
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:55,958
- She didn't graduate
- I know

763
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,952
They're disgusting

764
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:09,310
Take it away

765
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,555
Disgusting

766
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,318
They gave them back

767
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,231
Neither Gaia nor myself
took care of things

768
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:32,957
Eat, they're excellent

769
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:36,112
- But...
- Action!

770
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,553
They look like asses

771
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,596
The cake!

772
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:25,956
L'aurora di bianco vestita...

773
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:56,988
Where did they get
that orchestra?

774
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,195
- And Gaia?
- She's sick

775
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:05,195
- She was fine yesterday
- Yes she was, but today...

776
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:10,757
They say she stayed in Bologna
because she was embarassed

777
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:16,674
I'm sorry for what
happened to Sandra

778
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,956
I'm sorry...

779
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,829
But madam is...

780
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:27,229
...very upset
- I don't know...

781
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,959
Repeat!

782
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:59,558
Even the laurel

783
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:06,397
Let's go right now.
The joke is over

784
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:16,959
Is it true you never
received a diploma?

785
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:21,352
The party is marvelous,
anyway

786
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:25,634
You don't know what
a real party is like

787
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:28,634
Forgive us...

788
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:37,751
I'll organize it
the next time

789
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:45,798
Thanks.
You were wonderful

790
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,110
Not really

791
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:53,950
They swiped three forks

792
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,436
They took them as souvenirs

793
01:26:57,160 --> 01:27:01,836
We'll take care of the bill
another time

794
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:05,716
It was a success

795
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:12,593
- I don't know
- Goodnight

796
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:18,029
- We're going
- We'll take them to teh train

797
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,113
Be careful with the truck

798
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:25,431
- Alright
- Goodbye

799
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:28,756
Thank you

800
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:45,159
- I'm here...
- We're going

801
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:49,796
This envelope contains
what we owe you

802
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:52,953
I don't want it

803
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,998
No diploma, no party

804
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,316
It's true, but you
earned the money

805
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:04,789
I don't want it...
he doesn't

806
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,678
It's free...

807
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,278
If he doesn't want it,
don't insist

808
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,079
Right

809
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:24,588
It's the first real present
I'm giving you

810
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,636
I knew from the beginning

811
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:34,748
that the party was for
you... and I accepted

812
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:40,358
...you knew that, huh?

813
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:44,069
Who cares about your
husband and daughter

814
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,119
It was to make you happy

815
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:50,549
People in love
give presents

816
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,479
Look... there's
a surprise for you

817
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,958
The same lights
as on that day

818
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,673
You remember?

819
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:13,433
You wanted them turned
on until morning

820
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:19,559
We can do the same tonight

821
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,960
We'll leave them on

822
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:06,435
- Finally
- Where were you?

823
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:09,273
- Are you hungry?
- A little

824
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:13,517
I only have some bread

825
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:21,192
...it came out well so
that's a good sign
