00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,589
 BOY (READING): One night
 a woman fell from a boat

2
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,310
 into the ocean.

3
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:15,849
 No one saw her fall.

4
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,439
 The wa-- the waves were rough.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,249
 -Soon she glue--
 grew-- glue tight.

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,899
 Then something
 bumped against her.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:38,629
 "A shark" she thought. "Oh, no!"

8
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,969
 It was not a shark.

9
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,979
 It was a dolphin.

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:48,739
 Grint-- grinit-- grinily, it
 pushed her towards the shore.

11
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:54,049
 Water-- shallow water at last.

12
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:04,889
 The-- she care-- ca-- cake--
 cleared up-- cleared up.

13
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,159
 Clare--

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,329
 LUIS MACIAS (VOICEOVER):
 This is my son Alejandro.

15
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,229
 During first grade,
 we transferred him

16
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,579
 to a private school
 near our house.

17
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,229
 He was tested for
 reading and math

18
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,309
 and we were shocked to find out
 that he was behind in reading.

19
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,269
 In an effort to
 help him catch up,

20
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,109
 he met with the school's
 resource teacher

21
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,569
 and he met with a reading tutor.

22
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,229
 Unfortunately, he was
 still behind at the end

23
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,249
 of first grade.

24
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,099
 So, at the recommendation of
 his teacher and the principal,

25
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,629
 we held him back.

26
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,419
 I will always
 regret that decision

27
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,169
 because it is something that
 still haunts him to this day.

28
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,439
 Halfway through second
 grade, it was my mother

29
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,889
 who suggested to us that we
 have him tested for dyslexia.

30
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,629
 We did and the results came back
 that he was indeed dyslexic.

31
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,369
 We went his school and told
 the principal and his teacher

32
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,069
 that he had been
 diagnosed and that he

33
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,319
 was going to need
 accommodations.

34
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,959
 And the schools actually
 really good about that.

35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,409
 At this same meeting, I
 remember asking the principal

36
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,099
 about the best way of telling
 Al that he was dyslexic.

37
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,448
 And I remember the principal
 telling us that she didn't want

38
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,119
 to use the D word and
 that labelling children is

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,929
 a bad thing and we
 shouldn't do it.

40
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,169
 I thought that was a really
 strange answer because here was

41
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,679
 a child who was struggling
 and he knew he was struggling.

42
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,879
 I felt that we should
 tell him and we

43
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,389
 should help him understand
 what dyslexia is

44
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,409
 and what it means for him.

45
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,249
 So we did.

46
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,909
 Since then, [INAUDIBLE]
 confidence has soared.

47
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,479
 And with the help of the
 school's resource teacher,

48
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,069
 in now a private
 dyslexia tutor, he

49
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,899
 has become a much
 stronger reader

50
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,109
 and continues to improve.

51
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,779
 Learning about dyslexia
 and embracing it

52
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,499
 has changed our
 lives for the better.

53
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,769
 MAUREEN O'CONNOR
 (VOICEOVER): Dyslexia

54
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,949
 is a neurologically
 based disability.

55
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,239
 It affects the
 ability of the child

56
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,879
 to, or the person to
 acquire written language.

57
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,389
 -It's very heredity-- hereditary
 and it's-- it's generally

58
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,499
 if there's a father who
 is dyslexic or a mother,

59
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,429
 one of their children
 is going to be,

60
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,609
 it's going to be dyslexia.

61
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,379
 Sometimes even, it won't
 affect the mother and father

62
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,849
 but when you, when you talk to
 find out, well, there's an aunt

63
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,459
 or there's an uncle
 or there's somebody

64
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,719
 in-- in their family who has
 had a similar, a similar problem

65
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,249
 with acquiring a
 written language.

66
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,739
 It can be unexpected and
 that the child appears

67
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,199
 to be very bright, which
 dyslexic children are

68
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,039
 very bright.

69
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,739
 And in many cases, the
 high cognitive ability

70
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,179
 can almost work against them.

71
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,739
 They're compensating so much.

72
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,229
 And people don't realize that
 they're really struggling.

73
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,669
 And so, they may go on and
 perhaps do average work.

74
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,509
 But maybe they were meant
 to do more than that.

75
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,809
 You know, maybe they were
 meant to do above average work

76
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,359
 and they were meant to be
 super, super successful students

77
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,839
 and they never get their chance
 because the right tools were

78
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,409
 not there to find
 out what was really

79
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,939
 going-- going on with them.

80
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,339
 -Um, before Kendall was
 diagnosed with dyslexia,

81
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,869
 she was frustrated.

82
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,979
 I was frustrated.

83
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,489
 It was very difficult.

84
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,479
 I assumed she was
 being stubborn.

85
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,049
 KAREN HOPE (VOICEOVER):
 It was very hard on her

86
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:17,179
 when it came time to read
 because the teachers kept

87
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,828
 telling me "you need to
 spend more time with her,

88
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:19,898
 spend more time with her."

89
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,449
 And I felt like we were
 adequately spending the time

90
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,849
 she needed to learn how to read.

91
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,599
 She just couldn't pronounce
 the words, follow the story,

92
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,969
 she didn't know how to read.

93
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,709
 -Early on in Logan's
 school career,

94
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,599
 I would say as
 early as preschool,

95
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,158
 we noticed struggles.

96
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,639
 Struggles learning is
 letters, his numbers,

97
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,049
 retaining that information
 is in his head.

98
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,149
 LEANN HARBAUGH (VOICEOVER): When
 we would talk to the teachers,

99
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,869
 almost always, we would hear
 that he's not reading at grade

100
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,369
 level, that he's struggling
 with his spelling.

101
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,408
 We would also get some
 reports about behavior issues

102
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:55,609
 because he was struggling and
 sometimes he would just give up

103
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,549
 and then there's nothing
 to do in the classroom,

104
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,019
 because you don't understand
 what you're reading,

105
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,819
a second grader, if
 they're [? greater ?],

106
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,759
 can become a behavior problem.

107
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,859
 -Jessica was in third
 grade when we kind of

108
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,649
 hit a wall here at
 home with homework.

109
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,239
 She had been fine up until
 then and-- and then it

110
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,299
 came to a point
 where she would just

111
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,319
 get frustrated
 almost immediately.

112
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,079
 LINDA PUPICH (VOICEOVER):
 She would spend hours just

113
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,639
 doing simple things
 that were sent home.

114
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,179
 And there were like tears, a lot
 of late nights, a lot of fits.

115
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,469
 We slowly started to see her
 self-confidence just tank.

116
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,479
 I mean, it just went
 down, and down, and down.

117
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,099
 She started to
 feel really stupid

118
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,329
 and didn't want to go to
 school and it was a hard time.

119
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,249
 -I noticed that Lauren
 was having difficulties

120
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,179
 between kindergarten
 and then first grade.

121
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,739
 Actually in kindergarten,
 her teacher approached us

122
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,529
 toward the end of the
 school year and said,

123
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,349
 "I think that Lauren needs
 some extra help with reading."

124
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,479
 LISA KURYLA
 (VOICEOVER): She's not

125
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,689
 grasping some of the concepts.

126
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,189
 She had difficulty
 decoding words.

127
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,319
 She would recognize
 the word and then not

128
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,269
 be able to say it
 again 10 seconds later.

129
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,479
 And that was when I noticed
 that were-- were some issues.

130
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,319
 -Before Cole was diagnosed
 with dyslexia, doing homework

131
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,619
 was a very stressful time of the
 day, both for us and for him.

132
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:24,129
 Part of it is because we didn't
 know what his troubles were.

133
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,829
 DAN MCDERMOTT (VOICEOVER):
 We didn't understand it.

134
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,699
 DEE MCDERMOTT (VOICEOVER): I
 had heard from his teachers

135
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,749
 that, you know, he
 was being lazy, not

136
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,709
 wanting to do his work.

137
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,259
 So that's what I thought it was.

138
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,809
 And in reality, he
 wasn't grasping it.

139
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,319
 So it was frustrating
 for both of us.

140
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,209
 As a parent, I just I thought
 he could do better, you know.

141
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,269
 And because I was listening
 to them telling me

142
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,539
 he was lazy, so.

143
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,009
 -It was just very frustrating.

144
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,169
 And I remember him crying
 and then I would cry

145
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,269
 and then it just
 became horrible.

146
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,259
 So it was not a good
 time at all for us.

147
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,589
 CORNELL AMERSON
 (VOICEOVER): First grade

148
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,329
 was much like kindergarten,
 you know with color and playing

149
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,889
 with the toy and all that.

150
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,579
 -And I remember sitting at
 the table in the classroom.

151
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,969
 You know that's the way the
 teacher had everything set up.

152
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,979
 And we can play with
 the toys instead,

153
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,739
 but you had to
 finish your homework

154
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,999
 assignment, usually
 classroom assignments.

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,009
 And I'm sitting here,
 trying to figure out,

156
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,939
 well I don't get it, I don't
 understand it, you know.

157
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,649
 I'm looking at these words
 'cause at that particular time,

158
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,519
 I didn't know how to read.

159
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,249
 I don't know if
 you're suppose to know

160
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,069
 how to read in the first grade.

161
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,159
 I knew I didn't know how
 to read in first grade.

162
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,179
 So by the time I
 got to second grade,

163
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,158
 it was-- I was just there, just
 looking at um this book and all

164
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,029
 these words and supposed
 to know this stuff.

165
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,759
 CORNELL AMERSON (VOICEOVER):
 And because I didn't, I

166
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,999
 didn't pass.

167
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,459
 I failed, in fact,
 they held me back.

168
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,369
 Then um the rest of
 it is pretty much

169
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,029
 a blur some what but I kind of
 figured out that I wasn't going

170
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,559
 to get this and this is as
 far as I was going to go.

171
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,949
 So what I did was learned
 how to be quiet, try

172
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,109
 to be as invisible
 as possible, you

173
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,719
 know I'm saying
 because you don't want

174
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,659
 to draw any attention
 to yourself.

175
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,799
 And I was aware that the
 other kids was getting it.

176
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,500
 I wasn't.

177
00:08:08,501 --> 00:08:12,019
 And so drawing is
 what I pretty much

178
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,769
 start doing to keep my-- I mean
 other then just being feeling

179
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,449
 like part of furniture,
 giving myself something

180
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,499
 to do while sitting I was there.

181
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,369
 I knew there was a problem but
 it seem like nobody around me

182
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,579
 seem to respond to it, you know.

183
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,749
 My mother was trying to be
 supportive of my circumstances

184
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,558
 because she knew something
 wasn't quite right.

185
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:38,509
 And I do remember her buying
 like um, um paper and pencils

186
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,519
 and would sit me
 down and try to work

187
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,489
 with me and all
 this kind of stuff.

188
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,949
 But my father, his
 thing was, he just

189
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,849
 plainly-- he said I
 was stupid and dumb

190
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,469
 and never amount to
 anything because he was

191
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,609
 in agreement with the
 teachers and stuff.

192
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,419
 So, you know, he made
 matters a little,

193
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,499
 he made it a lot worse
 than it should've been.

194
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,119
 Presently, I'm
 suffering from that.

195
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,829
 I'm paying a great cause
 because I'm shy of everything

196
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,669
 because at 49, I have
 no formal education.

197
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,879
 Never been to high school.

198
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,099
 Uh, never been to college.

199
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,189
 My schooling stopped at,
 to me, in the second grade,

200
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,339
 as far as I'm concerned.

201
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,189
 I think that's where
 it all stopped,

202
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,169
 to be perfectly honest.

203
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,629
 When I failed, somebody
 should've did something.

204
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,019
 When I was um grade school, I
 had always wanted to actually

205
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:31,059
 be a pilot because I
 love airplanes, you know,

206
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,539
 then and now.

207
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,849
 But as time went
 on with my drawing,

208
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,099
 I started realizing I was
 more interested in designing

209
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,189
 aircraft, more so than
 flying an aircraft.

210
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,489
 So now, I'm to the
 point where I want

211
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,579
 to get into
 designing spacecraft.

212
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,049
 But unfortunately, due
 to my circumstances,

213
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,279
 it's just-- that's just
 a dead dream right now.

214
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,479
 And I hate that.

215
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,619
 I really hate that.

216
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,119
 MARK HARBAUGH (VOICEOVER): Uh,
 school for me was not easy.

217
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,399
 It had various different
 levels of failure,

218
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,389
 had various different
 levels of success.

219
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,839
 Especially in my
 elementary days,

220
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,299
 I definitely had the
 teachers that saw me as lazy,

221
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,929
 wasn't trying.

222
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,519
 And I had the teachers
 that, you know,

223
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,359
 just viewed it as, oh,
 he'll get it some day.

224
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,349
 And in high school, I was
 definitely a C student.

225
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,979
 -I mean, the only thing
 I got an A in was Gym.

226
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,479
 And I was happy that
 it was my one A.

227
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,589
 And-- but although I
 liked history so I would

228
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,769
 do fairly well in history.

229
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,529
 But English and Math, uh
 any of that stuff was big

230
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,089
 struggles for me.

231
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:50,069
 Um, when I took my ACT for the
 first time to get into college,

232
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,289
 I think I scored a 13 on
 it, which wasn't great.

233
00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:00,369
 But then somehow through
 the resource in high school,

234
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,589
 I got to take the ACT again
 and I scored a 19 on it.

235
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:10,709
 And that time, it was read to
 me and it was also non-timed.

236
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:15,359
 I still remember to this day,
 sitting with my high school

237
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,549
 adviser, as you're getting ready
 to start looking at colleges,

238
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:23,579
 and he said, You should
 stop thinking about college.

239
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,799
 Start looking into
 trade schools.

240
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,199
 And you know it's
 probably the path

241
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,359
 that you're going
 to end up in life."

242
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:41,619
 And I walked out-- um, I walked
 out of that situation feeling

243
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:47,099
 OK, you can accept that
 or you can change it.

244
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,039
 And the way you're
 going to change it

245
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,439
 is um by not giving
 up, you know.

246
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,589
 It's easy to throw in the
 towel and say, OK I'm dumb,

247
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,290
 I'm stupid.

248
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,629
 This is your lot in life.

249
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:03,049
 But I knew I wasn't dumb,
 I knew I wasn't stupid.

250
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,459
 I had value, I had
 a lot to offer.

251
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,439
 Um, I found myself.

252
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,509
 I'm-- I was very social.

253
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,889
 I was very creative.

254
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,859
 I didn't have problems
 speaking in public,

255
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,879
 so you know, to
 me that piece was

256
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,419
 the part that I was
 going to go for.

257
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,669
 Um, so then when
 I went to college,

258
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:23,389
 I knew that I had
 to find a school

259
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:26,389
 that was not the
 big mega school.

260
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:31,139
 If I had a big mega school,
 I would have been lost.

261
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,489
 So I found a smaller school.

262
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,409
 I went to Bradley University.

263
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,289
 The classroom sizes was smaller.

264
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,849
 It was only about 4,000
 students on campus.

265
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,049
 The teachers were
 actually, the classes

266
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,339
 were actually taught by the
 professors, first as a TA.

267
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,919
 Average class size
 was 25 to 30 kids.

268
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,449
 So it was almost like
 going to high school

269
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,619
 but you had more independence.

270
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,469
 I mean I knew my professors
 and I would go to my professors

271
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,559
 and they would work with me.

272
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,369
 So that to me was huge.

273
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,769
 And again, I had to take
 the philosophy-- and I

274
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:05,599
 joke about it today to my
 kids, I said Cs get degrees.

275
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,649
 Because that's
 what I had to get.

276
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,129
 I add to get Cs.

277
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,039
 I get Bs every once in awhile.

278
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,599
 But at the end of the
 day, I got a degree.

279
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,819
 And I'm happy for that.

280
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,169
 HOLLY YORK (VOICEOVER): Some of
 the common myths about dyslexia

281
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:23,769
 fall under common questions
 and common characteristics

282
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,470
 of dyslexia.

283
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,129
 -For example, reversals.

284
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,469
 Many people think that
 individuals with dyslexia

285
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,019
 see things backwards.

286
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,599
 When in fact, that is a myth.

287
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,209
 They don't see things backwards.

288
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,139
 It's actually a
 neurologically-- a

289
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,709
 neurological issue
 within the brain.

290
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,599
 Another myth is that
 dyslexia is rare.

291
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,439
 And in fact,
 dyslexia is not rare.

292
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,069
 One out of five people have
 dyslexia and most of them

293
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:53,109
 will go undiagnosed their
 whole life and will struggle.

294
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,289
 -Some of the myths is that
 it's a vision problem.

295
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,599
 And it's not a vision problem.

296
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,789
 It cannot be corrected by
 colored lenses or overlays.

297
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,009
 It cannot be corrective by
 any kind of vision therapy.

298
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,449
 Efficient therapy does collect a
 problem that it's not dyslexia.

299
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,509
 There's a common misconception
 that it's a hearing problem

300
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,279
 or auditory processing
 problem, which

301
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,409
 is different than
 phonological processing.

302
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,439
 -Another thing people believe
 is that dyslexics cannot read.

303
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,689
 That is absolutely not true.

304
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,749
 Dyslexics can read,
 up to a point.

305
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,179
 But around third
 grade, if not sooner,

306
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,309
 they hit the wall in
 reading development.

307
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,089
 Another myth is
 that people believes

308
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,659
 dyslexics will never read well.

309
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,589
 In fact, dyslexics can
 become excellent readers,

310
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,109
 great spellers,
 wonderful writers

311
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,259
 if they are given the
 proper intervention.

312
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,379
 -Often times, I'm told,
 "Well, that's just

313
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,679
 kind of a junk term.

314
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,689
 It doesn't mean
 anything anymore."

315
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:50,719
 I even recently had a parent
 that took their child's

316
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,799
 results, after being diagnosed
 with dyslexia to the principal,

317
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,499
 and the principal said,
 "It does not exist.

318
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,749
 There's no such
 thing as dyslexia."

319
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,179
 -Some of the
 comments, the stories

320
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,269
 that we get from parents--
 you, you're not sure

321
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,169
 if you want to laugh or
 you want to cry about them.

322
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,829
 Because they're just,
 they don't make any sense.

323
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,579
 We'll have a parent
 say you know,

324
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,149
 "My child's in third
 grade and he's not reading

325
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,819
 but the teachers telling me that
 he's not trying hard enough."

326
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,399
 Or "he's just a little slow."

327
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,479
 Or "he'll grow into it."

328
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,509
 -You know, I had one parent tell
 me, who is from a very affluent

329
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,579
 school district, when her
 child was in first grade,

330
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:35,369
 that the teacher said to them or
 might have been administrator,

331
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,779
 that not everybody's
 child can be smart.

332
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,289
 And somebody has to stock
 the shelves at Walmart.

333
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:43,009
How do you tell that
 to a first grader?

334
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,569
How do you sell them
 that short that early?

335
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,739
 -If I could do anything for
 the children and individuals

336
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:59,459
 with dyslexia, it is to
 root out this insidious myth

337
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:04,539
 that children who can't learn
 to read are dumb or are stupid

338
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,849
 or not working to potential.

339
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,919
 What I want everyone to
 understand that there is

340
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,919
 reading and there
 is intelligence.

341
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,589
 And the reading circuit
 is about putting together

342
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:21,089
 all these parts with a
 child's intelligence.

343
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,919
 The intelligence of a
 child is not shown by

344
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,689
 whether they can
 learn to read or not.

345
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:33,839
 And it is an assumption that
 is shared by so many people

346
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,219
 and makes children who can't
 learn to read feel stupid.

347
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,319
 STEWART HUDSON
 (VOICEOVER): So we

348
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,129
 have a big problem in
 American education.

349
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,229
 The problem many of us
 are trying to work on

350
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,759
 in this field that affects
 anywhere from 2.5 million to 10

351
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,349
 million school kids,
 we're not allowed

352
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,269
 to name when we're working
 with kids in schools, dyslexia.

353
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,849
 -But what I think is
 important about labeling

354
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,209
 is the context matters.

355
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,559
 Labeling is not always bad,
 neither is it always good.

356
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,139
 And it can be disabling if
 what you're saying to a child

357
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,818
 is that dyslexia is a
 litany of deficiency,

358
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,439
 a list of things
 you ain't good at.

359
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,419
 Doesn't have to be that way.

360
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,239
 But we have a duty.

361
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,999
 We, who are adults, have a
 duty to change perceptions

362
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,169
 so that people understand
 the talents that go along

363
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,649
 with dyslexia and
 those who have it

364
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,879
 and the way their
 brains operate.

365
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,379
 It's a package of strengths
 and some areas of challenge.

366
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,479
 More to the school
 system, however,

367
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,009
 is labeling is sometimes
 relieving to a child

368
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,619
 and that's true whether
 it's a mental health

369
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,279
 issue or a learning
 issue or a health

370
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,899
 issue that's beyond a
 mental health issue.

371
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,549
 People need to get a
 hand hold on something

372
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,649
 in order to know
 it's not about them.

373
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,199
 That whatever they're
 contending with it,

374
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,489
 it might be a challenge,
 is not a character flaw.

375
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,299
 -I know that people don't like
 to refer to the word dyslexia.

376
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,259
 Administrators, teachers,
 even parents, perhaps,

377
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,899
 don't want to acknowledge
 that that's it.

378
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,699
 Or say the word or address it.

379
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,739
 But all I can say for
 a parents prospective

380
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,619
 is we saw our son hit a wall.

381
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,739
 Emotionally, we were
 frightened for him

382
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,139
 because he was shutting
 down on every level, felt

383
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,859
 so frustrated, felt so
 unworthy really, and incapable.

384
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,659
 And that word dyslexia
 changed everything for him.

385
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,639
 It gave a reason for why he
 struggled so much so that he

386
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,989
 wanted to do his end of
 the year fifth grade report

387
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,389
 and presentation on dyslexia,
 presented it to his classroom,

388
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,019
 felt empowered like
 this is why I struggle.

389
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,639
 There's actually a word for
 it, there's a reason for it,

390
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,369
 I'm not stupid, I'm not lazy.

391
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,539
 I work hard, probably
 harder than most of you

392
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,689
 have to work for
 maybe a lesser grade.

393
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,059
 But this is why.

394
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:55,149
 And so that word gave
 him purpose and meaning

395
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,889
 and it really did change
 everything for him.

396
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,089
 We were able to point to
 other people, professionals,

397
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,529
 inventors, presidents,
 lots of people

398
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,559
 in powerful positions
 who had dyslexia, too.

399
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,209
 And it-- it allowed him to
 believe in himself again.

400
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,409
 Like, oh, I can do it, too.

401
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,359
 And I can excel at
 other things and I

402
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,389
 can be-- I can be successful.

403
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,259
 -Well after the diagnosis,
 we reviewed the material,

404
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,669
 my husband and I with the
 physician that diagnosed her.

405
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,689
 We had some interest--
 you know, a list of things

406
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,249
 that we could do
 to help Kendall.

407
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,669
 We brought information
 back to her teachers

408
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,919
 and to the principal
 and we spoke with them.

409
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,869
 The teacher still did not quite
 understand what dyslexia was.

410
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,579
 That was kind of difficult.

411
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,039
 She tried, I mean, she
 tried to figure, you know,

412
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,619
 try to help us and
 figure out what that

413
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,949
 was but the
 understanding is it's not

414
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,399
 there yet quite
 in the community.

415
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,919
 I mean, she didn't
 grasp the concept

416
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,789
 that this wasn't something that
 she was just going to outgrow.

417
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,279
 Now talking with Kendall,
 she was a little bit more

418
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,709
 disappointed and devastated.

419
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,209
 She didn't quite understand it.

420
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,249
 You know, "I'm just
 like everybody else."

421
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,889
 She didn't want to go
 to resource classes.

422
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,239
 She didn't want to do the things
 that you needed to progress

423
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,439
 with her reading and with for
 understanding and how to learn.

424
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,939
 And then once we sat
 down on several occasions

425
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,589
 and we went through the
 different information with her,

426
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:20,209
 one day she was like, wow,
 mommy this is working.

427
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,109
 You know she'd sit down
 and do her homework

428
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,559
 and she wasn't as
 frustrated, there

429
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,019
 wasn't as much crying, you
 know, more temper tantrums.

430
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,209
 And I think she's understanding
 that you know, this is OK.

431
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:31,829
 This is you know, this is OK.

432
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,139
 This is who I am and
 I'm special and I'm

433
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,249
 going to use what I have
 and it's not a bad thing.

434
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,259
 -Personally, I think Cole
 when he was first diagnosed,

435
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,989
 he was very embarrassed about
 the fact that he had dyslexia.

436
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,379
He was always saying,
 "Why do I have this?"

437
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,099
You know "How come
 I get everything?"

438
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,729
 And it wasn't until I
 sat him down one day,

439
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,589
 because he was getting
 teased at school,

440
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,539
 that I suggested his tutor
 come into his classroom

441
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,249
 and talk to the kids
 because he doesn't have

442
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,799
 a physical disability
 that they see.

443
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,559
 DEE MCDERMOTT (VOICEOVER):
 And ever since then, Cole's

444
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,249
 become more proud of the
 fact that he has dyslexia

445
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,359
 and it's not such a
 curse to him anymore.

446
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,519
 MAUREEN O'CONNOR (VOICEOVER):
 Most public schools give

447
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,609
 a standard battery of tests that
 has three reading tests on it.

448
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:23,899
 It has a test of comprehension,
 a test of vocabulary,

449
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,619
 and a decoding test.

450
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,029
 -And that's it.

451
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,319
 Some have a fluency test.

452
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,899
 Um and so they take those,
 they average them together

453
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,869
 and then they tell you,
 well what you know,

454
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,199
 what the average is
 and where your child

455
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,509
 lives on that on
 a standard scale.

456
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,929
 But you need to know more about
 a child's reading than that.

457
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,859
 You need to have a
 good decoding survey,

458
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,559
 you have to know where is
 the breakdown in the reading,

459
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,260
you know?

460
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:50,449
Where, where is it happening?

461
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,069
Is it happening at
 the decoding level?

462
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,979
Is it happening at the
 comprehension level?

463
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,579
Is it happening at the word
 level with, with vocabulary?

464
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,129
 And you don't get that from
 a regular public school

465
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,920
 evaluation.

466
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,089
 -When a parent thinks that
 their child might have dyslexia

467
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,199
 and they're looking to
 find somebody to test them,

468
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,009
 to determine whether or
 not that is their problem,

469
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,839
 they need to make sure that they
 are looking for a person who

470
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,499
 is qualified to test
 their child with dyslexia.

471
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,999
 So that person needs to have
 a real understanding of what

472
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,109
 dyslexia is, they need to ask
 them for what types of tests

473
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,109
 they're going to be using.

474
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,839
 And there are lists of
 tests that are accepted

475
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,869
 in the dyslexia community as
 having the ability to determine

476
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,799
 whether or not somebody
 has to dyslexia.

477
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,179
 They need you to
 believe in dyslexia

478
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,199
 and that it's-- that it's real.

479
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,289
 And be able to use the
 term in their reports,

480
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,419
 that they give them a really
 nice long report that shows

481
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,949
 them what their
 scores are and how

482
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,259
 that, that backs
 up their diagnosis.

483
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,549
 So it needs to be
 very detailed and it

484
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,079
 needs to be explained
 in the parent in the way

485
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,579
 that they understand.

486
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,829
 And they need to have the
 educational level that would

487
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,659
 qualify them to be
 able to do that.

488
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,239
 -For parents who are just
 getting the knowledge,

489
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,369
 the information that their
 child is being diagnosed

490
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:09,549
 with dyslexia, it
 can be very scary.

491
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,399
 And I believe it's scary
 because they don't understand

492
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,389
 or they don't have
 enough information.

493
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,879
 And I think it's important
 that they take a deep breath

494
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,359
 and make a commitment
 to do some research

495
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,149
 and read the good books
 that are out there.

496
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,339
 It's not a death
 sentence at all.

497
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,479
 And the more
 information they have,

498
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,809
 um the better they're
 going to feel.

499
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:40,509
 And the exciting part is
 with that information,

500
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,059
 they're going to be able to
 help your child learn to read.

501
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,569
 And that's the goal.

502
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,519
 It's the parent, I
 believe, that is so afraid

503
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,169
 that they keep their
 eyes shut and they

504
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,779
 don't get the information
 they need so they can't

505
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,839
 parent that child and
 advocate for that child.

506
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,429
 And then the child
 struggles to learn to read.

507
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,089
 And we want to get past that.

508
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:01,809
 We want the child to learn
 to read and then become

509
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:06,039
 the whole human being that
 the child wants to be.

510
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,469
 LISA STANKUS (VOICEOVER):
 A dyslexic person

511
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,539
 primarily needs two things.

512
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,369
 They need Orton
 Gillingham tutoring

513
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,469
 and they need accommodations.

514
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,739
 And those are the two
 things to fight for.

515
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,819
 Now, you might and
 most likely will

516
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,749
 have to go and seek elsewhere,
 outside of the school

517
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:25,149
 to get the Orton
 Gillingham tutoring.

518
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,949
 But that is critical
 and it is attainable.

519
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,579
 It is something you can provide.

520
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,449
 And so you, as a
 parent, have to weigh.

521
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,929
 Am I going to wait
 for the school

522
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,519
to catch up and figure this out?

523
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,869
 Or am I going to take
 the bull by the horns

524
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:43,029
 and seek the help that
 I know my child needs,

525
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,559
 that I know is successful,
 research-based, scientifically

526
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,389
proven, and most
 supportive for my child?

527
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,049
 I just got to do it.

528
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:56,609
 -I've used Orton Gillingham
 for probably 25 years

529
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:00,839
 and it's just a
 successful program.

530
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,749
 I think it's successful
 because it is so structured.

531
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,779
 You don't leave room for error.

532
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,079
 You teach every letter,
 you teach every sound.

533
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,909
 Um, you don't go on
 until the child knows

534
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,929
 what has been previously taught.

535
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,949
 You're always
 building on success.

536
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,029
 I think the
 multi-sensory part of it

537
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,449
 is one of the most
 important parts.

538
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:27,109
 The child hears it, they
 see it, they feel it.

539
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,459
 -There are several Orton
 Gillingham-based programs

540
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,549
 tutors may use to teach
 dyslexics to read.

541
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:36,699
 It is really, really important
 that the tutor is well-trained

542
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,679
 and certified in the program
 in which they'll be using.

543
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,329
 As a tutor, I have
 seen firsthand

544
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,699
 the impact tutoring
 can have on a child.

545
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,659
 When they start with me,
 they're an emotional mass,

546
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:54,359
 they're very low self-esteem,
 failing in school.

547
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,159
 After their proper
 intervention and hard work,

548
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,469
 they have become
 successful students,

549
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,819
 their confidence
 is growing and they

550
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:06,039
 have got to the point where
 they actually enjoy reading.

551
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,639
 -Actually last summer, after
 Logan had been tutoring

552
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,259
 for about a year
 and a half, he read

553
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,999
 two novels over the summer.

554
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,339
 Just so unusual.

555
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,059
 Come up into his bedroom
 and he'd be reading a book.

556
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,229
 And so that was amazing.

557
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:23,059
 Um we have noticed and even
 the standardized tests scores

558
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,849
 that just came home
 this summer, what

559
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,679
 an improvement his
 were over last year.

560
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,559
 So we know, we now.

561
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,269
 I can see his
 spelling improving.

562
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,259
 I can see his writing.

563
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,039
 And he still struggles
 with getting LE thoughts

564
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,819
 on paper and there
 still other tools

565
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,869
 that we use to help with that.

566
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,789
 But we are definitely
 seeing an improvement.

567
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,559
 LEANN HARBAUGH (VOICEOVER):
 And just his self-esteem,

568
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,469
 that he's capable,
 and able to do it,

569
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,939
 has been really,
 really neat to see.

570
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,139
 LINDA PUPICH
 (VOICEOVER): Every day,

571
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,859
 I see a little light
 coming in her face

572
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,989
 when she does something,
 spell something,

573
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,789
 when she read something
 that she wasn't

574
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,789
 able to do before the tutoring.

575
00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:01,259
 And Alexia is in third grade,
 her sister, and Alexia,

576
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,969
yelled down "How do
 you spell whatever?"

577
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,299
 -And Jess yelled
 out how to spell it.

578
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,689
 And I was like, oh, yay!

579
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,079
 Hooray@ And um-- so I
 see many celebrations

580
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,519
 every day in her progress.

581
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,749
 And it's so exciting to
 me, to see her confidence

582
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,859
 just build and build and build.

583
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,159
 KAREN HOPE (VOICEOVER):
 From the moment

584
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,369
 she was diagnosed, until now,
 where it's, what, two years

585
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,179
 later, she's just
 done phenomenally.

586
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,549
 She actually had the
 choice last year in school,

587
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,589
 towards the halfway
 through the school,

588
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:31,559
 if you wanted to participate
 in spelling tests.

589
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,509
 And it was her choice
 and she chose to do so.

590
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,899
 And she did very well.

591
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,619
 -Her Maths skills
 went up greatly

592
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,219
 and she's reading
 and wanting to read.

593
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,129
 She no longer, you know, comes
 home and says "I hate reading.

594
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,269
 I don't want to read ever."

595
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,599
 KAREN HOPE (VOICEOVER):
 She's asking

596
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,669
 me to order certain
 books for her.

597
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,799
 You know, certain
 books that she's

598
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,499
 now interested
 in, chapter books.

599
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,459
 I mean that's a huge step for us
 because she wants to know what

600
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,189
 the next chapter's--
 what's the next book about.

601
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,929
 -So it's-- she's
 excited about reading.

602
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,669
 She's excited about school.

603
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:03,169
 And for us, that's
 just is a joy.

604
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,389
 It's joy to see in her.

605
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,629
 SUSAN BARTON (VOICEOVER):
 Classroom accommodations are

606
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:12,239
 essential for students with
 dyslexia who have either not

607
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,749
 gotten the right type of
 intervention yet or it

608
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,329
 hasn't-- may haven't had it long
 enough that the gap is closed.

609
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,789
 -Classroom accommodations
 are something

610
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,049
 the regular teacher
 does to do two things.

611
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:25,179
 One, to avoid accidentally
 humiliating this child.

612
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,349
How do humiliate a
 child with dyslexia?

613
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:31,359
 You accidentally reveal their
 weaknesses to their friends.

614
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,679
 So things they shouldn't do,
 ask them to read out in class,

615
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,039
 make them participate
 in a spelling bee,

616
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,829
 have them come up to the
 board and write the answers

617
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,709
 to the homework where they'll
 see his spelling issues

618
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,959
 and his handwriting
 issues and so on.

619
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,519
 The most important
 thing for a teacher

620
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,489
 is to keep his
 struggles private.

621
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,679
 His academic struggles are
 nobody else's business but his,

622
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,259
 the parents, and the teacher's.

623
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,319
 Nobody else should
 be aware of it.

624
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,439
 But there are other types of
 accommodations that teachers

625
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,159
 should also provide so that he
 can access the same curriculum

626
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,569
 as everyone else can
 prove this knowledge,

627
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,619
 even though we cannot
 yet read, write,

628
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,109
 and spell at grade level.

629
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,969
 So for instance, he needs to
 learn what's in the textbook

630
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,989
 but he can't read what's
 in the textbook, yet.

631
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:19,859
 So allow him to listen
 to his textbook on audio.

632
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,829
 He knows the answer
 to questions.

633
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,109
 Trust me, he spent
 hours, and hours,

634
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,179
 and hours studying for tests.

635
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,649
 But he can't write
 down the answers

636
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:28,139
 that he knows in
 acceptable forms

637
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,729
 so allow him to just
 do oral testing.

638
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,119
 If he does have to write answers
 or essays, grade it on content

639
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,519
 and ignore the spelling.

640
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,989
 Simple, easy things
 that costs no money.

641
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:43,699
 They don't require
 changing the curriculum.

642
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,979
 They just require an
 awareness by the teacher

643
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,209
 that these are necessary.

644
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,969
 And how to provide them
 in a way that doesn't make

645
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,919
 him look different.

646
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,319
 CAROLYN COWEN (VOICEOVER): Early
 intervention in the classroom,

647
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,969
 even before they
 get to the classroom

648
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,939
 if you possibly can
 do it, can really

649
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,109
 make a big difference
 in the outcomes.

650
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,989
 -And the sooner, the
 better because their brains

651
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,519
 are more plastic
 when they're younger.

652
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,679
 The sooner, the better because
 if they can-- if you can short

653
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,639
 circuit that
 failure cycle, which

654
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,679
 carries lifelong
 scars, all the better.

655
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,029
 Outside the classroom,
 it's also important.

656
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:25,789
 They need all kinds of supports
 that feed their self-image

657
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,819
 because most of the
 day in the school,

658
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:32,399
 they're getting negative
 messages about themselves.

659
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,339
 So if there are things that can
 be done that allow them to do--

660
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,819
 to work on their strengths,
 or do things that they enjoy,

661
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,739
 positive support from the family
 or activities, all of that

662
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,979
 is really important because
 it feeds their self-esteem.

663
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,619
 And they have to have
 a healthy sense of self

664
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,919
 to do that fight, to do that
 battle during the school day.

665
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,159
 -Despite their
 areas of struggle,

666
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,659
 dyslexics tend to be gifted
 in other areas, people skills.

667
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,589
 They can make outstanding
 teachers, politicians,

668
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:09,079
 motivational speakers,
 and community leaders.

669
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,229
 They tend to have
 amazing visual abilities.

670
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:17,689
 This helps them to become
 amazing artists, sculptures,

671
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:21,169
 filmmakers,
 hairdressers, architects.

672
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,369
 Dyslexics can become
 strong athletes

673
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:27,129
 based on their intuition
 and discipline skills.

674
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,269
 And due to their
 logical and hands-on way

675
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,299
 of learning and
 thinking, they can

676
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,599
 excel in the scientific
 areas, such as medicine,

677
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,569
 engineering, and computers.

678
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,799
 -They're not afraid
 to take risks,

679
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,449
 which is a wonderful quality.

680
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:45,419
 It can be frustrating if you're
 the parent of an eight-year-old

681
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,389
 child who's jumping
 out of trees or doing

682
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,149
 things that are
 seemingly impulsive.

683
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:55,669
 But it's a great quality, if
 you struggle with some things

684
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:59,139
but you pick yourself back up
 and you say, "You know what?

685
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,179
 I'm going to try it a
 different way this time."

686
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,029
 There are an estimated
 35%, they say,

687
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,709
 of entrepreneurs are dyslexic.

688
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,079
And an entrepreneur is
 a risk taker, right?

689
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,539
 It's somebody who sees
 things differently.

690
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:17,279
 We talk about the out-of-the-box
 thinkers who might look

691
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,189
 at something completely
 differently than the average

692
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,549
 person and come up with an idea
 that no one else has thought

693
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:29,339
 of, because of those
 skills, those talents.

694
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,419
 -I think it's
 tremendously important

695
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:35,889
 to foster the strengths if you
 have a child with dyslexia.

696
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:39,829
 I think that they spend a lot
 of their early educational

697
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:44,059
 experience in what
 feels like failure.

698
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,329
 And as parents and people
 who know them intimately,

699
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,289
 there's so much more than that.

700
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:52,109
 And they might need
 some convincing

701
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,749
 in those early years.

702
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,589
 DEBORAH LYNAM (VOICEOVER): So,
 really celebrate and give them

703
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:59,509
 many, many opportunities
 to feel and experience

704
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,379
 what success is like.

705
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,049
 Because for many of our kids,
 it can be the lifeline that

706
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,449
 gets them through
 the rough patches.

707
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:11,699
 -Becoming an Illinois
 Supreme Court Judge probably

708
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:17,319
 is the results of my
 entire life having someone

709
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,059
 helping me along the
 way and directing me.

710
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,039
 For instance, when
 I was a little girl,

711
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,299
 I really didn't
 do well in school.

712
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:31,899
 Now I know why is because I
 had dyslexia, have dyslexia.

713
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,699
 But people would encouraged
 me, "You know, you are doing

714
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,559
 really well." it's
 not-- it's OK.

715
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,169
 My mom and dad
 never really cared

716
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:42,239
 whether I got As, I got Cs.

717
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,359
 But what they did encourage
 me to be was a happy kid.

718
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,979
 ANNE BURKE (VOICEOVER):
 Do what you like to do.

719
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,319
 So off I went.

720
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,079
 -I went to be a gym teacher
 for the Chicago Park District.

721
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,619
 Very successful.

722
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,639
 I ran programs for several
 hundred kids, day camps.

723
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,699
 Started the Special Olympics in
 1968 and was very successful.

724
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,689
 I got married and
 my husband encourage

725
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:07,719
 me to go to law school.

726
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,138
 He says "You know
 all these things

727
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:10,988
 about kids with disabilities.

728
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:13,789
 You should be using
 it to help them."

729
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:15,079
 And I said, "But law school.

730
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,029
 You know I could hardly
 read, I can't spell."

731
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,609
 He said "I'll help you."

732
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:21,819
 So I did.

733
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,309
 And it was-- I was successful.

734
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,599
 I got Cs.

735
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,109
 I only got one or two As
 my whole law school career.

736
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,779
 CAROLYN COWEN (VOICEOVER):
 But I had that person

737
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,809
 encouraging me about
 what I could do.

738
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:36,408
 JOE KURYLA (VOICEOVER): Some of
 Lauren's strengths, creativity,

739
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:39,319
 art, that's something that
 we've been pretty happy about.

740
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,809
 When she draws something
 or paint something,

741
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,789
 it's it's-- she
 does a really nice

742
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,178
 job with that kind of a thing.

743
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,519
 She also has a really
 good big picture

744
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,569
 understanding of
 things, it even Math.

745
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:55,009
 She's not great at math but she
 understands at a high level,

746
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,789
 the concept, you know the
 macro level of what's going on.

747
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:01,429
 Getting the nuts and bolts
 is kind of difficult for her

748
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,289
 to put all of that
 together but man, she

749
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:05,359
 does understand what's going on.

750
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,089
 Socially, she's a very
 socially aware young girl.

751
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,349
 -And she's very well liked by
 I think everybody in her class.

752
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:15,819
 Every, everyone in her school
 really seems to like, really.

753
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,499
 They hug her when they see her.

754
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,629
 And then she seems
 to really have

755
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,019
 a great rapport with
 just about everybody.

756
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,699
 -I see dyslexia as
 a gift, especially

757
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,579
 in Jessica with her heart
 for other struggling people.

758
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,609
 And I think that
 for her, um that's

759
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:34,959
 grown a sense of compassion
 in her and a love for people

760
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,579
 that she might not have had
 if she hadn't had to walk

761
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,229
 through this journey the
 way that she has already.

762
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,479
 And um to me, that's
 a gift because I

763
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,239
 get the blessing of that,
 as well bu her love.

764
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,669
 But she's so good
 with other people

765
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:53,339
 and a couple weeks ago, she
 told her tutor there one day she

766
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,979
 might like to help kids that
 are struggling like she is.

767
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,809
 And it almost made
 me cry because it's

768
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:05,609
 just such a gift that she
 could find a purpose in what

769
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:09,529
 the world wants to say
 is no good or a stigma

770
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:12,959
 or stupid, that
 she could find hope

771
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,669
 in that and in a way to
 make it a good thing.

772
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,699
 STEWART HUDSON (VOICEOVER): We
 need to be very mindful of not

773
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:21,259
 making enemies of
 those we need to be

774
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,919
 part of changing
 American education.

775
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,349
 My sister's a school
 teacher in Wyoming.

776
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,219
 My sister-in-law is a
 special education school

777
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,239
 teacher in Pittsburgh,
 Pennsylvania.

778
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,939
 Around the Thanksgiving
 dinner table,

779
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,289
 I get in trouble talking
 bad about teachers,

780
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,989
 nor do I want to.

781
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,579
 But if you remember the
 phrase "Army Strong,"

782
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,959
 I think we need to
 come up with something

783
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,709
 called "Teacher Strong."

784
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,139
 And if you're going to
 be "Teacher Strong,"

785
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,039
 you are going to have to
 endure that you are operating

786
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,009
 in a very big system
 that does not always

787
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,649
 provide you the
 rewards you deserve.

788
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,409
 You're going to have to find
 a way, as many teachers do

789
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,129
 and I admire them for it,
 to provide your own reward.

790
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,319
 So remind yourself you're
 there for the kids.

791
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,309
 And to take some risk.

792
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:07,419
 It's not easy and it is not
 often rewarded by the system

793
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,629
 but it is rewarded by what
 teachers care about most,

794
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,879
 and that is results
 with the kids.

795
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,359
 Now I want to be
 clear, this means

796
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,539
 high standards for teachers.

797
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,599
 This means doing the things you
 need to do in a system to take

798
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,469
 those who are really
 not motivated by doing

799
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:26,709
 well and giving them
 something else to do.

800
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,589
 But for those who
 are doing well,

801
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,769
 find more and more ways of
 celebrating their success.

802
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:32,589
 None of this is easy.

803
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,369
 I don't want it to
 sound Pollyannish.

804
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:37,659
 And I'm not doing this just to
 have a good Thanksgiving dinner

805
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,509
 with my sister
 and sister-in-law.

806
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,879
 I believe in this very deeply.

807
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,879
 I've the greatest amount of
 admiration for what teachers do

808
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,569
 and yet we know that teachers
 need to be part of a change.

809
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,909
 -I think most teachers want
 the best for their students.

810
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,899
 I think they really want
 to do all that they can.

811
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:57,459
 I think they want um
 children who are achieving.

812
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,309
 I think they want-- they're
 in teaching because they love

813
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,689
 children and that's
 what they want to do.

814
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,729
 I think sometimes just
 because of the situations,

815
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:08,499
 the many children,
 the lack of materials,

816
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,789
 um the administrative
 complaints.

817
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:17,819
 There's a million things in
 a day that can pull you down.

818
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:22,269
 And I think um that--
 that also can affect

819
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,949
 the way that we
 look at children.

820
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,169
 A child who can't
 read all of a sudden

821
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,279
 becomes a problem,
 instead of a challenge.

822
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,349
 I think you have to look at
 kids as, as a whole child.

823
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:37,409
 You can't look at, well,
 this one can't read

824
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,899
 and this one can't do Math
 and this one can write.

825
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,569
 You have to look at
 them and you always

826
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,679
 have to look at them
 in terms of what

827
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,559
are the things that they can do?

828
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,069
 If you look at their gifts
 and you concentrate on those,

829
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,179
 you're going to be able
 to help with the deficits.

830
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,559
 -We've got to start
 with the universities

831
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,949
 because if the
 teachers coming out

832
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,419
 don't know anymore
 than the teachers

833
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,199
 from 30 or 40 years ago,
 we're not fixing anything.

834
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,429
 We need the
 universities to start

835
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:05,429
 working in their programs.

836
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,009
 They need to do--
 especially special ED

837
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,259
 teachers, the reading teachers.

838
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:12,139
 These teachers need to
 know it dyslexia is.

839
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,169
 I had a couple friends
 that went back to college

840
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,749
 and they said they learned
 more about dyslexia from me

841
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,399
 then they learned in
 any of their classes.

842
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,269
 And one did go back with
 a special ED certificate.

843
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,229
 And she said maybe
 we got five minutes

844
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,729
 about dyslexia, if that.

845
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:28,709
 And that's now.

846
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:32,089
 I mean, I might have expected
 that 20 years ago but not now.

847
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,869
 -When we work with
 teachers, they--

848
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:36,389
 they say we want
 this information.

849
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,739
 They email us all the time,
 they come into our classes

850
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,529
 and they say we really
 want this information.

851
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,989
 And then they always in
 in big capital letters

852
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,759
 with an explanation
 point, "Why didn't I

853
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,589
learned this in teacher
 training school?"

854
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,429
 So they really want
 this information

855
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,889
 and they have-- and the
 ones that are going out

856
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,209
 there and getting it
 themselves, I applaud them.

857
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,259
 But it's not as many
 as it needs to be.

858
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,049
 -Every teacher
 should be required

859
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:03,299
 to have one course on
 dyslexia in order to graduate.

860
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,070
What it is?

861
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:05,539
What the warning signs are?

862
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,589
How to help?

863
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,879
What won't help?

864
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,479
 Because unfortunately, dyslexia
 follows them all life long.

865
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,180
 So I'll tell you.

866
00:40:12,181 --> 00:40:13,879
 I've talk to a lot of
 junior high teachers

867
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,319
 and high school teachers
 who say "I can't believe

868
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,759
 how many children I have coming
 in as a freshman in high school

869
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,359
 who are reading at
 the third grade level.

870
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,869
What am I supposed
 to do with them?

871
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,509
 How do I teach them
 high school science

872
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,849
when they can't read the book?"

873
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,779
 So it's not just
 elementary school teachers

874
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,349
 who need to know about this.

875
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:35,949
 All teachers in public
 schools and private school

876
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:39,249
 should have a class on
 dyslexia before they're

877
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,159
 allowed to hit the classroom.

878
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,979
 So they'll understand
 what they're looking at

879
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,689
 and what needs to be done
 and they can warn parents,

880
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,289
 so that parents can
 take action early.

881
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:53,069
 -I think the biggest
 challenge to raise awareness

882
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:58,289
 with educators on what is
 dyslexia um it was first

883
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,269
 getting the states
 to acknowledge

884
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:03,529
 that dyslexia is
 neurobiological.

885
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:09,629
 A lot of states don't even have
 it at all, don't recognize it.

886
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:13,589
 And thus, these kids who
 could be identified so early,

887
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:17,559
 they could be screened
 in pre-K and kindergarten

888
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,799
 and then provided
 in general education

889
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,139
 great supports that really
 aren't that difficult.

890
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,339
 And science tells us,
 work for these children.

891
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,719
 They'll be all reading by
 the second or third grade

892
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,239
 or almost all, at
 least 98% of them.

893
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,019
 So the states have
 to acknowledge it.

894
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,429
 Our policymakers have
 to acknowledge it.

895
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:42,179
 And then we have to give
 the tools to our teachers.

896
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,709
 MARYANNE WOLF (VOICEOVER): When
 anyone asks what we could do

897
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,979
 about children with
 dyslexia, the first thing

898
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:53,789
 I want the world to
 know is that it exists.

899
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:59,349
 -It is a-- it is a different
 organization of a brain that

900
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,219
 is a wonderful brain, a
 brand that it has been

901
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,849
 here long before reading occurs.

902
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:09,099
 So the absolute first thing
 is a re-conceptualization

903
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,749
 of dyslexia for everyone.

904
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:17,659
 The second is that understanding
 is made available to the child,

905
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:22,239
 to the parent, to the
 peers, and to the teachers,

906
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,029
 and to the school systems,
 not just in this country,

907
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,679
 but around the world.

908
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,599
 Literacy affects everyone.

909
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,819
 Our children with
 dyslexia should never

910
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,779
 be deprived of
 access to literacy.

911
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,519
 This is probably one of our
 most interesting brains,

912
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,409
 as a species.

913
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:46,849
 We cannot have it lost in
 its contribution to society.

914
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:50,879
 -Right now, much of what
 we know about dyslexia

915
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,189
 comes from the careful
 work of many, many people

916
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:57,049
 over many years,
 showing the importance

917
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,659
 of phonological ability,
 and the importance

918
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,729
 of early environment,
 stimulative language,

919
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:06,209
 proper instruction
 in how to read.

920
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:08,289
 Reading can be miss-taught.

921
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:11,729
 We have very-- it's very easy
 to create what are called

922
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:16,669
 curriculum casualties, where you
 do not appreciate how reading

923
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:20,399
 is built and what
 should be reinforced.

924
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,549
 Emphasizing phonological skills,
 phonics, alphabetic principle,

925
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:27,649
 vocabulary-- these are things
 that have been recommended

926
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:31,989
 by the National Reading Panel
 that are healthy and important.

927
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:34,899
 Currently, brain science
 doesn't add much to that.

928
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,849
 But it offers a promise that
 we can begin to understand

929
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:41,009
 differences between
 people that are

930
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:44,139
 very subtle and
 yet very profound.

931
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:49,519
 -I think in this day and age,
 with-- after 20, 30 years

932
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,149
 of science that has proven
 one, that dyslexia does indeed

933
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:57,659
 exist, that's not reading,
 writing backwards,

934
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,869
 and that there's
 real methodology

935
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:04,349
 to help these children learn--
 that the time has come.

936
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,019
 We've got to stop the cycle.

937
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:11,729
 And want-- we need
 parents to speak out.

938
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:13,599
 And then-- that's
 one reason we came

939
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,779
 up with decoding
 dyslexia groups.

940
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:19,249
 -We are looking to raise
 dyslexia awareness.

941
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:22,929
 We're hoping to get parents
 to resources and supports

942
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:25,129
 in a timely fashion,
 quicker than we

943
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:27,099
 may have gone there ourselves.

944
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,519
 And we also want to make sure
 that we're out there sharing

945
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,479
 our story with policymakers
 and people who actually

946
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,139
 have the ability
 to affect change.

947
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:39,009
 From that three point
 mission statement,

948
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:42,399
 we've developed also talking
 points or policy goals.

949
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,349
 And those are to have a unified
 definition of dyslexia in state

950
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:51,939
 education codes, to
 mandate early screening,

951
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:55,239
 early intervention,
 teacher training,

952
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,300
 and access to a
 sister technologies.

953
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:03,169
 LUIS MACIAS (VOICEOVER):
 Dyslexia is a global issue.

954
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:05,809
 It affects up to 20%
 of the population.

955
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,599
 That's a lot of people.

956
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,549
 Every classroom has
 at least one student

957
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,799
 who struggles to some
 degree with reading,

958
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,259
 writing, and spelling.

959
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,499
 Parents are frustrated
 because they don't understand

960
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,179
 why and teachers who want
 to help these students

961
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,639
 but don't know how.

962
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,909
 One word, dyslexia,
 can change all that.

963
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:26,169
 But it requires
 knowledge, understanding,

964
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:29,549
 and support to move forward.

965
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:32,569
 Parents-- it's really important
 to know that it's never

966
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:35,029
 too late to get help for
 your struggling child.

967
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:37,799
 No matter how old they are
 when they are diagnosed,

968
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,649
 you can get them help.

969
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:41,569
 They can become
 proficient readers

970
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:43,869
 and they can get their
 self-esteem back.

971
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,949
 It's not a hopeless situation.

972
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:48,309
 But it does require
 work on your part.

973
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:50,249
 You will have to do research.

974
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,779
 You will have to educate
 yourself so that you can learn

975
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,209
 how best to support
 your child at home

976
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:57,869
 and advocate for him in school.

977
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,169
 Teachers-- how many of you
 have students in your classroom

978
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:05,449
who seem so smart but yet
 they struggle so much?

979
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:08,319
 How often have you been banging
 your head against the wall,

980
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,259
 trying to figure out what you
 can do to help this child,

981
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,369
 believing there is
 an answer but not

982
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,769
knowing where to
 find that answer?

983
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:19,129
 Take it upon yourself to
 learn more about dyslexia.

984
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:21,059
 You can help give
 parents an answer

985
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,069
 and you can be the reason
 a child with dyslexia

986
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:26,549
 will find the road
 to success, instead

987
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,159
 of the road of
 constant struggle.

988
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,899
 Schools-- if your primary
 function is to educate all

989
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,649
 children, then you cannot
 keep turning a blind eye

990
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,519
 to something that
 affects one out

991
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,009
 of five of your
 student population.

992
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:42,519
 Dyslexia is real.

993
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,139
 And please understand
 that early dyslexia

994
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,799
 screening and
 intervention is smart.

995
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,219
 It makes sense.

996
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:52,459
 It saves time and money
 and most importantly, it

997
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:55,829
 removes roadblocks that can
 keep our children with dyslexia

998
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,169
 from reaching their
 full potential.

999
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:01,789
 And finally, policymakers--
 you have the ability

1000
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:04,979
 to pass laws that make it
 mandatory for all schools

1001
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:08,059
 to screen every single
 student for dyslexia.

1002
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,209
 And to also provide
 children with dyslexia

1003
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:12,589
 was scientifically
 proven instruction.

1004
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:15,539
 You also have the ability
 to pass laws that require

1005
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,889
 every teacher training college
 to include at least one course

1006
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:21,799
 on dyslexia, so that new
 teachers can be better

1007
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,759
 prepared to meet the needs
 of all their students.

1008
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,429
 With all of the dyslexia
 research that exists,

1009
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,209
 there is no reason why a child
 who struggles with reading,

1010
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:32,589
 writing, and spelling
 cannot get the help they

1011
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:35,449
 need to become
 successful students.
