Synched by ShooCat

3
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:30,113
There's a tornado watch
for a portion of West Texas.

4
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:33,074
Brian Chadwick is with the county
sheriff's office in Sweetwater.

5
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,785
We're trying to get the word out to
the community to brace themselves.

6
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,247
We hope this thing's not gonna
develop into a real funnel...

7
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,666
but after Saragosa, we're
not taking any chances.

8
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,878
The National Weather Service says
the storm is moving northeast...

9
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:48,923
and with the exception of some rain, it
shouldn't affect the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

10
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:53,845
That's news, sports and weather. I'm
Frank Castle for KGAB talk radio news.

11
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,643
From the heart of
the Lone Star state,

12
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,938
it's time for Dallas'
most popular talk show,

13
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,359
Night Talk
with Barry Champlaign.

14
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,402
# Bad to the bone #

15
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,864
The KGAB phone lines are open
and ready for your call...

16
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,492
at 555-TALK.

17
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,162
And now your host for Night
Talk, Barry Champlaign.

18
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,207
- The worst news
of the night is that...

19
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:26,628
three of four people say they'd rather
watch TV than have sex with their spouse.

20
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:30,006
The second worst news is that some
kids needed money for crack last night,

21
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:33,468
so they stuck a knife in the throat
of an 80-year-old grandmother...

22
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,679
down on Euclid Avenue
right here in Dallas.

23
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,598
One night
in one American city.

24
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,142
Multiply that by hundreds of
cities and what have you got?

25
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,145
A country where culture means
pornography and slasher films,;

26
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,273
where ethics means payoffs,
graft, insider trading,;

27
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,527
where integrity means Iying,
whoring and intoxication.

28
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,196
This country is
in deep trouble, people.

29
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,866
This country is rotten to the core and
somebody better do something about it.

30
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,788
Take your hand out of that bowl of
Fritos, throw away your National Enquirer,

31
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,749
and pick up the phone,
hold it up to your face...

32
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,127
and dial 555-TALK.

33
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,714
Open your mouth and tell me what we're
gonna do about the mess this country's in.

34
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,550
Talk radio- it's the last
neighborhood in town.

35
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,593
People don't talk
to each other anymore.

36
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,721
Let's go to
the first caller.

37
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,099
A lot of problems with the
country today have a lot do...

38
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:25,186
- with the continued exploitation
of the third world countries.

39
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,982
Wait. Third world countries? Where'd
you learn that phrase, in college?

40
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,943
Do you know what it means?
You're getting off the track.

41
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,154
We're not getting off the track,
we're getting on.

42
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:37,157
Josh, go back to college. When
you graduate, give me a call.

43
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,451
A prime example of that
uniquely American institution;

44
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,453
the concerned
bleeding-heart liberal...

45
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,205
looking for people with
problems he can call his own.

46
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,750
Francine in Oakline.
I'm a transvestite.

47
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,044
I'm trying to save money
for an operation...

48
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:53,882
What interest do you think your adventures
in surgery hold for my listeners?

49
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,885
It's something I have to talk
about. I don't. Night Talk.

50
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,305
Let me put you on hold. You slip
some testosterone into Barry's coffee?

51
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,599
The guy's possessed tonight.
He's a little tense.

52
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,977
Get outta here!

53
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:09,272
Sometimes I come home from work and
we have dinner together, you know?

54
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,984
No, I don't know. You have
dinner at the table with your cat?

55
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:16,237
With a tablecloth and
candles? No, Barry.

56
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,032
Just her own plate on the floor. Good.

57
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:23,620
But we eat the same things. Like if I
have a pork chop, she has a pork chop.

58
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,872
If I have a veal,
she has a veal.

59
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,333
Glenn, take my advice.

60
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,544
Stop hangin' around with
the pussy. Go find some.

61
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,005
I'm listening, Michael.
What's up?

62
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:39,427
Yeah, I heard your little
advertisement there for the pizza place.

63
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,681
Yeah, Jericho's Pizza. I love
that pizza. Don't you like it?

64
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,517
You sound like you'd love
it. I enjoy Jericho's Pizza.

65
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,311
What I wanted to say to you
tonight, Mr. Champlaign, was...

66
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,189
I have an interest in this place,
or at least, some friends of mine...

67
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:55,068
Just use one-syllables, Billy,
if it's difficult. Oh, Michael.

68
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,487
Hey, smart guy.
Just use one-syllable...

69
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,907
Smart guy?
We're being- Smart guy.

70
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,201
We got somebody with
a little lip on us tonight.

71
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,538
Hey.
Don't call me "Hey."

72
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:10,458
This is not a conversation. This
is a monologue. I talk, you listen.

73
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,753
Understand me?
Oh, yeah, we're listening.

74
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,588
Yes? Go ahead.

75
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:20,051
I don't want you makin' any more
comments about the pizza joint.

76
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,221
Do you have relatives that run the
place? People gotta make money on this.

77
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,306
Uncle Vinnie or someone?
There are people...

78
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,559
You know what, Michael?
You're a meatball.

79
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,270
- Debbie in Highland Park.
- My name is Debbie.

80
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,897
Hello, Debbie.
How old are you?

81
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,525
I'm 23.
Uh-huh.

82
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,652
What do you do?
I don't do anything.

83
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,697
When was the last time
you did something?

84
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,450
I don't know.
About a month ago.

85
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,870
What'd you do a month ago?
I went swimmin'!

86
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:50,165
Mm-hmm.
What do you do for money?

87
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,751
I got my brother.
I haven't made any.

88
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,753
Debbie, you're a leech.

89
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,464
Don't you think it's time you got
off your duff, started making money?

90
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,967
Well, not really.
I got everything I want.

91
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,720
But, Debbie, what do you need? Well...

92
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,098
What are you missing that
you need? A guy. A boyfriend.

93
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:10,018
A guy? What do you have
to offer a guy?

94
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,354
Well...

95
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,773
I have nice,
shiny long hair...

96
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,025
A guy could buy
himself a wig.

97
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,570
You can tell I don't have a wig.
It never falls off.

98
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,406
You're terrific, darling.
But seriously, Debbie.

99
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,577
Aren't you shooting for anything more
in life than looking for a free meal?

100
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:29,496
Not really.

101
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,248
You wanna lie around till you
find somebody to take care of you.

102
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,793
Yeah.
You're dynamic, darling.

103
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:38,046
Rhonda from Garland on the line.
Rhonda, you're on Night Talk.

104
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,048
Barry, I want to
express my views...

105
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:43,176
What are you doing, Steve?
Looking at this Dietz guy.

106
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,638
...up in New York City, givin'
out needles to drug addicts.

107
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,307
They have to do it to stop
AIDS. Clean needles help.

108
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,810
It's immoral for the
government of this country...

109
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,562
tax dollars to be
goin' to addicts.

110
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,440
But it's all right for our tax
dollars, four billion of them,

111
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,567
to go into a system
that's a complete joke.

112
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:02,112
More drugs than ever
are coming into this country.

113
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,572
Our courts, our jails
are clogged with cases.

114
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,617
The other night up in New York City,
crack dealers killed another cop.

115
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,787
Any kid who wants a hit
can get one. That's right.

116
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,248
When are we gonna
wake up, Rhonda?

117
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:17,836
When are we going to admit that drug
prohibition is not working in this country?

118
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,838
I think-
Know what I think?

119
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:23,216
I think we should legalize all
drugs, as sinister as that sounds.

120
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,177
That's the dumbest thing
I ever heard. Is it?

121
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,680
A junkie could go to a
drugstore, More stuff, Laura.

122
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,057
sign his name,
get the stuff for a buck...

123
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,310
then he doesn't have to rob or
kill for his habit. Thanks, Ellen.

124
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,479
You cannot let children
have drugs.

125
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,442
Why not? They're gonna
get it anyway. Why not?

126
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,320
In America today we're talking about
shooting up in the eighth grade.

127
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,489
We have a moral obligation
to the children.

128
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,075
Know what the most
dangerous drug is?

129
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,494
It's heroin.
No, it's legal.

130
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,289
It's tobacco.
It kills 350, 000 people a year.

131
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,625
You know how much coke, crack,
heroin, pot kill every year?

132
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,503
Four thousand people. Will you
listen to sense? Hello? Let me check.

133
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,048
Will you listen to logic,
please?

134
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,509
The only people who benefit
from prohibition...

135
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,678
are the gangsters
makin' the money on it,

136
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,389
the politicians condemning
it and gettin' your vote.

137
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:14,976
And who foots the bill?
You, Rhonda Q Sucker!

138
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,562
I beg your pardon!
It would end tomorrow.

139
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:22,567
The $200 billion drug problem in this
country could disappear overnight.

140
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,780
Legalize the damn stuff. Do it
today, right after this message.

141
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,199
I'm Barry Champlaign.
This is Night Talk.

142
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,744
We're gonna go to a message. I'll
be right back after I shoot up.

143
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,954
Who's the schlub?

144
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,458
Barry, Dan and I wanted to tell you
before the show we have some good news.

145
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,671
Barry? Dan, I can't talk
right now. I gotta take a leak.

146
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,881
I'll catch you later,
okay?

147
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:49,052
Stu, cool it with the baseball calls
and the transvestites. How's the lines?

148
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,388
I got five hanging on
already. Give me 45.

149
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,432
You got it. Barry, I'd like
you to meet Chuck Dietz,

150
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,352
V.P. in charge of advertising,
Metro Wave, Chicago.

151
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,897
Really? Very nice to meet
you. It's my pleasure.

152
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,274
I've been reading all
your press clippings...

153
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,902
and listening to tapes
of your shows for weeks.

154
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,030
And?
And you're really something.

155
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,199
You're very funny.
I try to amuse.

156
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,077
I'm in the middle of a show. I've
gotta move it along. Genius at work.

157
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:18,248
Metro Wave's picking up the show starting
Monday, linking it to a national feed.

158
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,418
Some people at Humphrey's Coffee
want to sponsor the show nationally.

159
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,461
We're at cold; 30, Bar.

160
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,798
Wait a minute. The show's going
national starting Monday night?

161
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,842
When did this happen?

162
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:32,095
- Don't I get a say in this? You know about this?
- Yeah.

163
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,764
Dan
- We didn't know anything about it until tonight.

164
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,434
No sense getting you all
excited until it panned out.

165
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,395
Chuck is here to be the eyes and
ears of Metro Wave, so to speak.

166
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,480
So to speak.
Fifteen, Bar.

167
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,358
Why don't you go ahead.
We can talk later.

168
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,280
We got a hot show. We're talking Larry King here
- coast to coast.

169
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,824
It's always a hot show,
Dan. Stu, find me a catheter.

170
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:56,244
Extra hot. We'll get a
contract for six months. Jawohl.

171
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,164
You're listening
to the best talk in Texas.

172
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,751
Barry Champlaign on KGAB.
You know about this?

173
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:06,463
Yeah. Chill, will you, Barry?
The bucks don't suck. Stand by.

174
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,506
555-TALK.
Yo.

175
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,971
Metro Wave Broadcasting
is a giant media corporation...

176
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,266
specializing
in broadcast radio.

177
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,102
It has 357
affiliate stations...

178
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,813
in the United States
and Canada.

179
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,982
Two minutes ago
I received a phone call...

180
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,903
from the man who controls
those 357 stations...

181
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,365
the president of
Metro Wave Broadcasting.

182
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:37,452
He asked me if Metro Wave
could pick up this show,

183
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:42,165
pick up Barry Champlaign for national
syndication, beginning Monday night.

184
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,542
I've had
these offers before,

185
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,921
and I've been asked in the past
if I could ever soften my touch,

186
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:51,341
go a little easier, and my
answer has always been the same;

187
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:54,552
Take it or leave it.

188
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,056
He took it.

189
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,892
And so,
beginning Monday night,

190
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,896
this show, Night Talk,
begins national broadcasting.

191
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,273
That means the nation
is listening.

192
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:11,152
You better have something
to say. I know I do.

193
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,154
And we have Chet from Mesquite
on the line.

194
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,824
Hello, Chet.
Hello?

195
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,368
You think you're so smart.
Hello?

196
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,247
Why are you always talkin'
about the drugs and niggers...

197
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,374
and homos and Jews?

198
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,835
Isn't there anything else to
talk about? You know what I hate?

199
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,337
I hate people who tell me what
they don't wanna talk about.

200
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:32,298
You don't wanna talk about blacks
and gays, why'd you bring them up?

201
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,259
Sounds like you like
talking about them.

202
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,095
Tell me what you wanna talk
about, or get off the phone.

203
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,681
Why don't you start telling
the truth? About what?

204
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:44,728
You know. People behind your
show, people who pay the bills.

205
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,480
Talking about the sponsors
now. Don't you act dumb with me.

206
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,524
What kind of a name
is Champlaign?

207
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,527
I want you to cancel my plane
reservations for tonight. You changed it?

208
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,237
I'm gonna come in tomorrow. Maybe
because it sounded too Jewish.

209
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,449
Call Freddie. Tell him to call me
tomorrow. Change the name, get a nose job,

210
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,576
same old story.
Chet, come on!

211
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:03,288
He started out a bit shaky. Your
attitude reminds me of a story.

212
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,874
Last summer
I visited Germany.

213
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,335
Wanted to take a look
at Hitler's homeland.

214
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,462
Are you familiar
with Adolf Hitler, Chet?

215
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,006
I'm familiar
with Adolf Hitler.

216
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,508
I bet you are.

217
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:20,221
I decided to visit the remains of a
concentration camp on the outskirts of Munich:

218
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,223
Dachau.

219
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:26,811
You join a tour group, go out by bus,
get out at the gate. It's chilling.

220
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:30,273
A sign over the gate says,
"Arbeit Macht Frei. "

221
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:35,779
It means, "Work will make you free"
- something the Nazis told their prisoners.

222
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:39,949
You still listening to me,
Chet? I'm counting your lies.

223
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,035
Good. I wanna make sure
you're hearing them.

224
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:46,956
I'm walking around this concentration
camp, and I see something on the ground.

225
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:50,960
I picked it up.
Guess what I found, Chet?

226
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:55,507
A tiny Star of David.
Very old.

227
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,927
Who knows? It might've belonged to
one of the prisoners at the camp.

228
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,137
Maybe a small boy
torn from his parents...

229
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,807
as they were dragged off
to the slaughterhouse.

230
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:08,144
I kept that Star of David.

231
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:12,732
I know I shouldn't have, but I did.
I keep it right here on my console.

232
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,734
I like to hold it
sometimes.

233
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:18,988
In fact, well...
I'm holding it right now.

234
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,951
I like to hold it in my hand
to give me courage.

235
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:26,663
Maybe some of the courage that small
boy had as he faced unspeakable evil...

236
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,666
can enter me as I face
the trials in my own life...

237
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,502
as I face the cowardly
and the narrow-minded.

238
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,797
The bitter, bigoted people who
hide behind anonymous phone calls...

239
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,133
full of hatred
and poisonous bile.

240
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,968
The gutless,
spineless people...

241
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:43,304
like you, Chet,
who make me puke!

242
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:47,726
Keep talkin', Jewboy.
Life is short.

243
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,856
Stu, let's send
a microwave oven out to Chet.

244
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,608
And we have Kent on the line.
Yeah, Kent?

245
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,111
I need help.
Shoot.

246
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,197
I like to party
with my girlfriend.

247
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,742
How old are you?
Nineteen.

248
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,202
How old's your girlfriend?
Seventeen.

249
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:10,081
Okay, go ahead. So we
like to party, you know?

250
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:14,544
When you're partying, where
are your parents? On a vacation.

251
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:17,088
He's so excited about it.
Look at him.

252
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,924
I think it's Fiji.
Is that right?

253
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:23,762
Is there a place called Fiji? Excuse
me. I'm gonna take care of some stuff.

254
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:27,557
Your parents are on vacation in a
place called Fiji, and you're partying.

255
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:30,894
Yeah, that's what I wanted
to ask you about, Bar.

256
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,564
See, we've been partying
for a couple of days. Uh-huh.

257
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:37,400
Smokin' coke, crack.

258
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,487
Free-base.

259
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,366
Sounds pretty sordid, Kent. You've
been smoking crack with your girlfriend.

260
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,077
What else you been up to?
Drinkin'.

261
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,162
Mm-hmm.
I don't know.

262
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:53,667
I drank a bottle of 100-proof whiskey
yesterday 'cause I was gettin' paranoid.

263
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,962
Jill was doin' some acid
with some Valium.

264
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,048
It was...

265
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:03,593
Kent, you need to call a
doctor, have your stomach pumped.

266
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:07,430
Let me give you a number to
call. That's why I'm callin' you.

267
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,350
Why?
It's Jill.

268
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,522
She's been sleepin' a long time
- No, no, no.

269
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,608
She's been sleepin'
and she won't wake up.

270
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:22,862
Don't waste my time with this baloney.
When you get outta detox, give me a call.

271
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,240
She's turnin' blue.
She's turning blue?

272
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:29,869
Great. Just give Stu your address
and we'll send an ambulance there now.

273
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:32,956
Give Stu your address, we'll
send an ambulance in two minutes.

274
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,334
I can't! I can't! I'm gonna
get your address. Kent, hello?

275
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,170
Hello?

276
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,967
I'm really glad people like Kent
are out there and I'm inside here.

277
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,136
We're gonna go to
a little commercial break now.

278
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:50,807
Whoo-whee! Jericho's Pizza, down
Route 111 at the Jericho Turnpike.

279
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,561
They got pizza you'll never forget. One
slice, you don't have to eat for a week.

280
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:59,607
I saw a guy in there combing his hair with
his stuff off the plate. Jericho's Pizza.

281
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:03,445
We have the news and weather coming up,
then we'll be back with more Night Talk.

282
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,575
Here's your mail.
You read it.

283
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,373
What's the problem tonight?
Fight with the old lady?

284
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,585
No, there's no problems.
Throwing me some real curve balls.

285
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:22,088
What's wrong with curve
balls, Bar? Some call.

286
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,341
It's a hoax.
How can you be sure?

287
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,552
A hoax. Stu, who's this
Henry? You didn't give me this.

288
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,846
Who's Denise from Fort
Worth? I didn't get that.

289
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,682
- Maybe Laura should take the calls.
- These people were stiffs.

290
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,185
You want stiffs, I'll
give you stiffs. No, Stu.

291
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,480
I don't want stiffs. Am I
speaking English? Read my lips.

292
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,107
Keep the show moving,
give me stuff I can work with.

293
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:44,361
You having trouble understanding
me? No, I'm not having trouble.

294
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,072
As a matter of fact,
I read you loud and clear.

295
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,074
Good!

296
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,497
Barry?

297
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,500
Barry.

298
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:02,504
Honey, just relax.
Everything's under control.

299
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,506
It's my ass on the line,
not yours.

300
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:08,468
All you have to do
is just be nice.

301
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,720
Okay?
Just for tonight.

302
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,308
You be nice, Laura.
It's what you're good at.

303
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,896
You're not gonna lose
even with a 15...

304
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,483
Jerry, I'm gonna put you on
hold. Something wrong, Barry?

305
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:26,069
I can't work with him breathing
down my neck. I want him out now!

306
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,531
I have your contract right here. Why
don't you take it and look it over.

307
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,158
You dump it on me the Friday
before it's gonna happen.

308
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,911
You stick some putz
in the middle of my studio.

309
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,996
I feel like I'm auditioning
for my own job!

310
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,165
Barry, calm down.
You don't care.

311
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:42,085
Just stick me out there,
see how it goes.

312
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,713
Doesn't work out, flush Barry
down the toilet, right?

313
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:49,884
You're not gonna get me to apologize
for getting you a slot on national radio.

314
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,262
I worked very hard on this deal,
and I'm happy with it.

315
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,931
If you're not,
we tear up the contract,

316
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,475
we don't do
the Metro Wave hookup.

317
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:01,479
Big mistake, guy. I think it's worth the
gamble because I think the show is good.

318
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:06,651
Barry, you are good. And it will
blow them away everywhere it's heard.

319
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,320
Dietz goes with the deal.
Grin and bear it.

320
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,907
You do your job,
I'll do mine.

321
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:15,285
Did you run Sani Clean
before the news?

322
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,912
Yes, I did.
You up with your log?

323
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:21,416
There's a Harry's, a Firestone,
a logo. They're all on track.

324
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,626
Good. Don't let it get to
you. It's been a strange night.

325
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,546
There's nothing strange about it.
How long you been working here?

326
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,674
Four months. How long you
been sleeping with him?

327
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,926
Listen, Ellen.
I was gonna cheer you up.

328
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,638
Metro Wave, the network, is picking
up the show. We're going national.

329
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:39,517
Oh, my God. In Chicago
too? Yeah, in Chicago too.

330
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:43,021
It's not that simple-
You must be so excited!

331
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,357
Yeah, of course
I'm excited.

332
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,443
We got this character here from
the company keeping an eye on me.

333
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:53,114
I'll be right off the phone. Ellen,
will you tell him you're talking to me?

334
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:56,618
I like this stuff. Nights like
tonight are what it's all about.

335
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,912
You either get used to it
or you get lost.

336
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,248
That's what his wife did
- left him. So did the two producers who were here before you.

337
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,334
But big Stu stayed,
didn't he?

338
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:08,713
I don't have to take his shit. I'm
not his wife. You're not, but I am.

339
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,965
This is not the best time
forme to talk.

340
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:14,469
Yeah, yeah.
I'm sorry I'm calling so late.

341
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,681
It's just that This is
important. Barry, 20!

342
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:21,351
I need your help with something.
I never ask you for anything and...

343
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,520
Barry...

344
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:26,356
Can you come to Dallas
over the weekend, till Tuesday?

345
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:30,860
What? I need someone
here I can trust. It's...

346
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,697
- It's important.
- Damn it! Come on!

347
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,074
I don't think he's
gonna let me. Forget it.

348
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,368
Forget it.
Don't come.

349
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,578
He answered,
"The night he didn't come home. "

350
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:44,290
No, that happened all the time.
Ellen?

351
00:18:44,374 --> 00:18:46,376
I'm thinking, okay?

352
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,628
Five, Bar.

353
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:53,299
Allright. Sunday? You pick me
up at the airport. Strap in, Bar.

354
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,719
Yeah, I'll be there.
Here we go.

355
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,930
- Look, I gotta go. Bye.
- You're listening to the best talk in Texas.

356
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:01,558
The phone lines are open, and
your calls are invited now...

357
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,394
at 555-TALK.

358
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,732
Bob, what a relief.
How you doing tonight?

359
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,942
Terrific.
Very well, thank you.

360
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:13,820
I hope you're not gonna get
too busy to take my calls.

361
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,948
No show is complete without
your call. How are the legs?

362
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:20,076
They're fine
- an ache or two. But you know what I say?

363
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,162
When they give you lemons,
make lemonade.

364
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:25,457
You can't cry over spilled
milk. Cry, and you cry alone.

365
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,334
You can't lose
what you never had.

366
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,669
Because you don't know
what you got until you lost it.

367
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:32,047
So don't lose hope.
This too shall pass.

368
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,592
Because today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

369
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:39,512
Yeah, and it's always darkest
before dawn. Bob, could I just...

370
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:44,809
People think that life in a wheelchair
must be the worst thing in the world.

371
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,811
That's not the way
I look at it.

372
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,606
I imagine the worst thing
in the world would be...

373
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:53,151
bein' unthankful for all the good
things that come our way everyday.

374
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,071
The smiles on little children,
flowers bloomin',

375
00:19:56,154 --> 00:20:00,158
little birds chirpin', sittin' on the
buddin' branches on a bright spring day.

376
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:05,246
Why, hell, just the sun comin'
up every day is a miracle.

377
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,500
I couldn't agree with you more,
especially that part about the sun.

378
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:12,462
We get bogged down in our daily troubles
and we forget about the simple things.

379
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:15,465
Oh, I forgot one more thing
to be thankful for.

380
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:18,718
What's that?
The Barry Champlaign show.

381
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:21,763
Thank you, Bob.
Listen, we gotta run.

382
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,808
Know you can't, but we can. So God bless you
- One more thing.

383
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,852
Don't put all your eggs in one
basket. A bird in the hand...

384
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,521
- Good night. And we have-
- Debbie, you still there?

385
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:34,401
- Turn your radio down. Stop crying.
- Well, I'm black.

386
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,987
Good for you.
What do you want? A medal?

387
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:42,450
Well, no, I don't. Don't play
with me like them other people.

388
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:44,953
I want you to know...

389
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:49,708
that I enjoy listening to your show,
and I want to say, I like you Jews.

390
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,253
Well, I like you blacks.
I think everyone should own one.

391
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:56,089
What I mean to say is,

392
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,134
Uh-huh. I have many
friends who are Jewish.

393
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:02,554
Really? How many?
Well, three or four.

394
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:05,306
I wouldn't call that "many."
They're very nice people.

395
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,517
They're educated
and they're good in business.

396
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,854
John, I don't know how to break this to you,
but you'll never get in the B'nai B'rith.

397
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,606
You're black. Don't you know
how Jews feel about blacks?

398
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:17,902
They hate you! They see you schwartzes on
the street, they cross to the other side.

399
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:21,906
You know those slums in south Dallas
where the rats eat babies for breakfast?

400
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:26,411
Jews own those slums! What do you mean, I
love Jews? Are you some kind of Uncle Tom?

401
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:29,414
What the hell you know about
Uncle Tom? I think brotherhood...

402
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:33,084
I don't care what you think!
No one does!

403
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:36,629
You wanna know why? Because you're
trying to kiss the master's butt.

404
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:39,674
What? You call me up, try to get
deep on how much you love Jews.

405
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,719
You're Iying. You hate them.
You hate me!

406
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:46,389
I don't kiss nobody's butt!
Sure you do! You kiss my butt.

407
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,975
You're kissing my butt right now.
If you weren't, you'd hang up on me.

408
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,436
I don't wanna hang up on you!
Then I'll do you the favor.

409
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,230
- Night Talk.
Debbie, you're on.

410
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,232
Barry?
Mm-hmm.

411
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:58,234
This is Debbie again.

412
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:00,236
Oh, Debbie. Right.

413
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:04,115
She of the long hair,
my zombie queen, my fantasy.

414
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:07,285
How are you, my belle?
Bad.

415
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:10,997
I've been thinkin' about
what you said.

416
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:15,418
I wanna ask you somethin'.
Yeah?

417
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,088
What's wrong with me?
What?

418
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:21,132
Chet's back. You've had Debbie on twice.
I don't think you should take the call.

419
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:24,469
Barry? I can handle
it. Just shoot it to me.

420
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:28,473
This is too important. I'm not gonna jump
through hoops tonight just because of this...

421
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,559
Please,
tell him to put it on.

422
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:36,106
Yeah, Debbie, look,
you should see the shape I'm in.

423
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:40,276
I mean, nothing a good plastic surgeon
or a glass of cyanide wouldn't fix.

424
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:43,947
I mean, you're young. You got
your whole life ahead of you.

425
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,825
Why don't I go anywhere?

426
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,411
Well, you gotta
stand up first.

427
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:53,415
I mean, every journey
begins with a single step.

428
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:56,501
You gotta go for it,
pumpkin.

429
00:22:56,584 --> 00:23:00,797
Me and Linda used to go out,
but she moved to Houston.

430
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,218
Yeah- Heh!
Listen, Debbie, Debbie.

431
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:09,681
You got two arms and two legs? Yeah.

432
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:13,184
Are you blind?
No.

433
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:16,312
You got a belly button?
Yeah.

434
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,233
Two belly buttons?
No, I got one.

435
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,527
Are you sure?
Have you looked lately?

436
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,447
Yeah. I got one.
You're gonna be fine.

437
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,157
You're gonna be just fine.

438
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:31,578
And we have... Chet from
Mesquite on the line. Chet?

439
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:34,831
So now everyone in the country
can hear your big mouth flap.

440
00:23:34,873 --> 00:23:36,916
Chet, so nice
to hear from you again.

441
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,002
Shouldn't you be out burning
crosses or molesting children?

442
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,547
I'd rather be talking to you.
How about training pit bulls?

443
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,549
Think you're so smart.

444
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:48,762
You get the package
I sent down to the station?

445
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:52,140
Package?

446
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:56,061
You got it, I know you did.
You sent me a present?

447
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,521
I couldn't decide whether
to use a timer or not.

448
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:00,857
You'll have to find that out
when you open it.

449
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:03,735
You're telling me
you sent me a bomb in the mail?

450
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:07,072
Wrapped in brown paper. I know
you're lookin' at it right now.

451
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:08,865
You just take some C-4,

452
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:14,204
roll it in a pile of nuts and bolts
and pebbles, and it does the job.

453
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,706
Sounds interesting, Chet.
I didn't receive your package.

454
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:19,042
Sure you sent it to the
right address? You got it.

455
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:22,545
If I were you, I'd have my pretty
assistant give the police a call.

456
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:24,714
Take the bomb squad
ten minutes to get there.

457
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:27,592
Why should I call
the bomb squad, Chet?

458
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:31,429
Because some pinheaded redneck moron
tells me there's a bomb in my mail?

459
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,431
He who laughs last...

460
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,433
Shut up!

461
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,560
Night Talk.
Denise, you're on.

462
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:40,814
I'm scared, Barry. What
are you scared of, babe?

463
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:44,109
Nothin' specifically,
but on the other hand...

464
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:46,236
it's like everywhere I go...

465
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,363
Mm-hmm. Yeah?

466
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,699
Barry, you know,
we've got...

467
00:24:50,782 --> 00:24:53,159
a garbage disposal in our
kitchen sink. Yeah, it's fine.

468
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:55,578
Tell Dan my mail
is my business.

469
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,541
This is not funny. You tell
Dan my mail is my business.

470
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:03,628
You know how that feels when you have
to reach down there into that gook...

471
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:06,423
and put your hand around?

472
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:08,967
Who knows what
could be down there?

473
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:12,387
Dan, I hope you're not calling the cops.
If you are, I'm gonna get really pissed off.

474
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,723
Get off the phone
or I walk.

475
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:18,393
There's germs you can't even
see. Don't waste my time, man.

476
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:21,104
Hang it or I walk!
They grow there.

477
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:23,314
Hang it up! They come back up the pipes.

478
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:28,069
- Salmonella, yeast, cancer, even
the common cold. Who knows?

479
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:31,573
But, Barry, even without
all of that, what if...

480
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:33,575
and I'm just sayin'
what if...

481
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:37,620
what if that disposal came on
while your hand was down there?

482
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:41,458
And it goes around and around
- Denise, tell me something.

483
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:46,296
You're telling me that you're afraid of the
garbage disposal in your mother's kitchen?

484
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,799
Well, it's not just
the garbage disposal.

485
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:52,886
I like things
to be clean, Barry.

486
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:54,888
How often does
this happen?

487
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:57,515
Couple times since
I've been here.

488
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,810
Like the houses on our street. Used
to be we knew who lived on our street.

489
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:04,939
But that was years ago. Now all
different kinds of people live here...

490
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:08,109
foreigners,
people with accents.

491
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:11,654
Are they sanitary? Why
don't you ask one of them?

492
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:14,574
That would be a nice idea to
just go to somebody's house...

493
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,826
and knock on their door,

494
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:20,997
but what if a serial murderer
lived there?

495
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:23,500
What if Ted Bundy
lived there?

496
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:27,379
What if he was sittin' inside watchin'
television, and I came to the door?

497
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:32,258
"Why, you just come right on
in here, Denise, " he'd say.

498
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:35,303
That's why I don't go to
strange people's houses anymore.

499
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:39,683
I keep the doors locked at all times,
but that's not gonna solve anything.

500
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:43,603
You're not gonna stop a plane from
crashin' onto your house, are you?

501
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:48,274
No. The mailman brings
me unsolicited mail.

502
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:52,362
The postage stamp could've been
licked by somebody with AIDS.

503
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:56,658
My mother's a threat to my life
just by persistin' to go out there.

504
00:26:56,741 --> 00:27:00,036
- Out where? Where does your mother go?
- Barry...

505
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:04,207
Barry, did you know there's this
terrible dust storm in California?

506
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:07,377
It has these fungus spores
in it, and these spores...

507
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:09,921
get into people's lungs
and their bloodstream...

508
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:12,757
and it grows,
and then it kills them.

509
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:16,594
Strange air.
Strange air, Barry.

510
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:19,180
Oh, I hear my mother's key
in the door.

511
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:24,894
Strange air.
Well, uh...

512
00:27:24,936 --> 00:27:29,399
That about wraps up another thrilling
episode with the man you love to love.

513
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:32,569
Gotta go home now,
take care of the goldfish.

514
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:37,532
Stay tuned, 'cause Monday's when
Night Talk begins national syndication,

515
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:40,285
allowing the good folks of Dallas
to have verbal intercourse...

516
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:42,454
with the rest of the U.S.A.

517
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:44,748
But don't go away yet.

518
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:48,084
If you've got any psychological
problems or you're just plain suicidal,

519
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:52,047
Dr. Sheila Fleming is here, and she'll
be glad to give you some dubious advice.

520
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,801
Or if you're just a level headed, happy,
normal person, you can turn the radio off.

521
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:01,139
Until Monday, this is Barry
Champlaign reminding you that...

522
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:06,269
sticks and stones can break your
bones, but words cause permanent damage.

523
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:10,607
# Bad to the bone
B- B-B-B-Bad #

524
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:14,444
It's time to strap him up and wheel
him away for his weekend therapy.

525
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:18,073
But Barry Champlaign will be back
with more Night Talk Monday...

526
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:20,283
on KGAB, Dallas.

527
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:24,829
Barry, my man.
What's happenin'?

528
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:29,501
The coach is here. You're gonna say
a few words and then give him the cup,

529
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:31,795
and then he's gonna talk. Yeah.

530
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:35,882
Now, you're gonna be
introduced by Mel in the booth.

531
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,927
Got it.
You hear the show last night?

532
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,263
A great show.
Great show.

533
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:45,308
Listen, I never got that autographed
picture that you promised...

534
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:47,852
so I can hang it
in my restaurant.

535
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:50,480
You were supposed to send it over
three weeks ago. It slipped my mind.

536
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:53,900
Slipped your mind? What mind? What
could be more important than that Dino?

537
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:58,279
I'll send it over first thing
tomorrow. Don't go to any trouble.

538
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:00,281
No trouble.
Where is he?

539
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,867
There he is.

540
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:05,995
Stick around. You are the
greatest, Barry! All right.

541
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,164
See you.
See you later.

542
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:10,500
He's a great guy, huh? Of course he is.

543
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,336
He thinks you're God.
What bit you in the ass?

544
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:18,341
You're pissed' cause I tell you to get
a picture for the guy, which is your job.

545
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:22,512
I'm pissed because you haven't said two
words to me all week except to boss me around.

546
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:26,307
We work together. That's the deal.
I'm the boss. I boss you around.

547
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:29,811
It's more than that. It's like you're
always angry with me. Excuse me.

548
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:32,731
You're Barry Champlaign,
aren't you? Yeah.

549
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:35,525
Can I have an autograph?
Thanks. Sure thing.

550
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,819
Hi.
Hi.

551
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:41,281
Here you go.
Thanks a lot.

552
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,616
I love your show.

553
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,702
Okay, see you later.

554
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:47,704
Back in the cage.

555
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:50,457
I used to listen to your show
when I was in high school.

556
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,335
I'm supposed to be doing my homework, and
- Barry?

557
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:57,714
You wanna make it out
to Joe Bob, please? Sure.

558
00:29:57,797 --> 00:30:01,301
You should have called. I would
have come and tucked you in.

559
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:03,678
Thanks, Barry.
God bless.

560
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:06,431
God bless you,
Joe Bob.

561
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:10,060
The show going national is
important. Let's work together.

562
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:13,813
Just be a little more careful
around this guy Dietz.

563
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:16,232
This is a big thing,
Barry.

564
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,819
Right. I'm not greasing
my way up a pole.

565
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:23,073
I resent it that when I talk to
you like your producer... All right.

566
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:25,325
you treat me
like a girlfriend,

567
00:30:25,408 --> 00:30:29,621
and when I talk to you like your
girlfriend, you treat me like your wife.

568
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:33,416
I'm not following the drift
of this conversation.

569
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,087
We work together, we
sleep together. That's it.

570
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:40,256
I didn't know when we started seeing each
other I was enrolling in a self-help course.

571
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:42,634
If I'm angry,
that's who I am.

572
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:46,471
For better or for worse, that's
what got me where I am today.

573
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:49,641
If you think it's tough on the outside,
just be thankful you weren't born me.

574
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:53,103
I've gotta be out of my mind
picking a fight with you.

575
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:55,271
You a little moody today?
Is that the problem?

576
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:59,275
Excuse me. Are you
Mr. Barry Champlaign?

577
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,403
Uh, maybe.

578
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:04,989
Could I have your autograph? Sure, sure.

579
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:07,867
You do a great job
on the show.

580
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:09,994
I couldn't do it without you. Thank you.

581
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:12,956
I listen to your show
all the time.

582
00:31:12,997 --> 00:31:15,917
I think you're a sick,
foul-mouthed, disgusting man,

583
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:20,422
and you make people really
nauseous 365 days a year.

584
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:24,175
It just goes to show what masochists
people are, they listen 365 days a year.

585
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:26,553
I don't know why they leave your
show on the air. Let's get outta here.

586
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:30,890
Everybody I know hates it. It
makes me wanna throw my radio out.

587
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:33,351
Let's go. If you don't like
the show, why do you listen?

588
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:36,396
'Cause I'm waitin' for a better
program that's on later.

589
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:40,233
Waiting for another program? There
are 30 other shows on in Dallas.

590
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:42,986
You listen to my show
every night. Makes sense.

591
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:46,656
I feel real sorry for you, and I think
you should be ashamed of yourself.

592
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:49,576
- You're such a pathetic nerd.
- I should be ashamed?

593
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:54,164
At least I don't show up in public, half in
the bag, making an utter jerk out of myself.

594
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:58,293
You have no credibility. You
like what I do. You need me.

595
00:31:58,376 --> 00:32:02,172
But you have no sense of humor, which
is why you can never enjoy the show,

596
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:04,966
which is why you're a loser, like
all people who have no sense of humor.

597
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:08,136
And you are categorically
one of them. Good-bye.

598
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:11,306
- Furthermore- - Lady, what
the hell is the matter with you?

599
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:18,480
What'd you do? What
happened to your suit? Jesus.

600
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:21,107
All right,
you're gonna be fine.

601
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:24,569
Come on. Let's go.

602
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:29,032
All of us are here for something very
important and exciting at S.M. U.,

603
00:32:29,074 --> 00:32:31,368
and I think you know
what I'm talking about.

604
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:35,705
Who's ready for a new beginning?
How about Mustang football this fall?

605
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:38,041
That's what I thought.

606
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:46,424
Now
- Now, to introduce the new man in charge of football here at S.M.U.,

607
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:50,345
our own KGAB radio personality-
the man you love to love...

608
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:53,682
ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Barry Champlaign!

609
00:32:56,935 --> 00:33:02,065
Thank you. On my way
over here tonight, I...

610
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:05,110
I was finding out that...

611
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:21,334
They love me.
They really love me.

612
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,921
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's calm down.

613
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:38,685
A different kind of welcome
than I've ever experienced.

614
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:52,449
Barry?

615
00:33:55,869 --> 00:33:58,121
Barry!

616
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:01,624
Barry.

617
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,589
Hello? Laura, it's Dan. Is Barry there?

618
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:09,591
Hang on a second.

619
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,304
It's Dan.
Hmm?

620
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:16,306
Did I wake you up?
I'm sorry.

621
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:19,142
No, I always get up ten hours
before I have to go to work.

622
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:21,811
It's Sunday, your day off
from self-loathing.

623
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:25,106
You said you didn't want Dietz breathing
down your neck, so we had a drink.

624
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:30,570
He's a sharp guy. Loves you, loves the show.
You should sit down with him, have a chat.

625
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:32,864
Is he gonna give
you orders now?

626
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:36,659
I figured you'd look at it that way,
so I set up a meeting for Sunday brunch.

627
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:39,204
What? He's got some great ideas, Bar.

628
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:41,331
The guy wouldn't know an idea
if it crawled on his kneecap.

629
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:43,416
Just hold your horses
for one minute.

630
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,170
Chuck and I decided before we hit national
air we should establish a few ground rules.

631
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:51,216
Ground rules? What is this, Dan?
A radio station or an airport?

632
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:54,427
Will you shut the fuck up and
listen? No, I won't listen to you.

633
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:59,391
I knew that when that corporate cannibal
came into my studio I was in trouble.

634
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:02,310
What difference does it make
to you? It's just a show, right?

635
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:06,773
Are you saying I don't care? Nobody cares
more than I do. I don't wanna hear it.

636
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:10,902
I'm gonna come in tomorrow night, I'm
gonna do the same show I do every night.

637
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:14,656
And blow the deal.
If it means that, yes.

638
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:17,659
I do my show, or I don't
do a show. Good-bye.

639
00:35:17,742 --> 00:35:20,412
You f...

640
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,375
I gotta take a piss.

641
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,051
Hello?
Is Barry there?

642
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:38,888
Who's calling, please? Look, I'm
in a rush. Could you just get Barry?

643
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:42,142
Barry, phone again!
It's a woman!

644
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:45,645
Get her number. I'll call
her back. He'll call you back.

645
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:48,690
It's a pay phone. I can't
call you back. Who is this?

646
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:52,569
Look, just tell Barry
it's his ex-wife. Huh!

647
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:56,406
It's a pay phone. She can't you
call back. It's your ex-wife.

648
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:58,450
Shit.

649
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:04,622
Give me that. Ellen, hi. I'm
down at the airport. Remember?

650
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:08,084
What airport? Dallas. What
do you think? It's Sunday.

651
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:11,379
You told me to be here.
Uh, well, great.

652
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:13,882
Are you too busy,
or are you coming to get me?

653
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:17,927
Yeah. No, I'm not busy.
I'm just doing some work here.

654
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:20,096
Who answered the phone? I
thought you said you were alone.

655
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:25,226
It's just my secretary. Look,
Ellen, what airline are you on?

656
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:28,146
American Airlines.
Maybe I should just leave.

657
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:30,648
No, you stay there. I'll
see you in 20 minutes, okay?

658
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,152
You better be here. Yeah,
I'll see you in 20 minutes.

659
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:36,571
Are you allright? I'm fine.
I'll see you in 20 minutes.

660
00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:38,073
Okay. See ya. Bye.

661
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,410
I gotta get her now.

662
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:44,412
Where are my shoes?

663
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:50,210
What?
Don't give me that look.

664
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,588
Hey.

665
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:57,467
Hey, come here. She wants to
be here for the national show.

666
00:36:57,509 --> 00:37:00,595
What am I supposed to do?
Say no? Huh?

667
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:06,059
What did Dan want?

668
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:08,561
Wants me to come in
and kiss Dietz's ass.

669
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:10,855
I told him
to kiss my microphone.

670
00:37:17,862 --> 00:37:20,824
Look, uh...

671
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:24,327
Can you clean up around here
a bit before you go? Huh?

672
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:27,288
Where's my shoes?

673
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:32,043
I'll call you later,
okay?

674
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:47,100
You look nice.
Thanks.

675
00:37:47,183 --> 00:37:49,269
You look great.
You look good too.

676
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:52,230
Except for my wrinkled clothes. Except for
- I miss you, so what?

677
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:54,983
So what have you been doing? I hate when
you call me in the middle of the night.

678
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:58,987
Lou is so pissed off at me,
I had a fight.

679
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,490
I had a fight at the end of this
with Lou. You're too good for Lou.

680
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:06,619
Don't start, Barry.
Barry, don't start.

681
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:08,163
You been going to a health
club? You're such a jerk.

682
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:11,624
Excuse me? You been going to
a health club or something?

683
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,960
Why?
You look dynamite.

684
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:17,714
I left you. I look
dynamite 'cause I left you.

685
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:21,468
Jesus. I spend time,
a little, on my own self.

686
00:38:21,551 --> 00:38:24,763
I'm working too. I'm not
at someone's beck and call.

687
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:27,390
Ellen this, Ellen that.
I want this, I want that.

688
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:32,395
I may not have worked for you
- You just have to bring him food. Is that basically it?

689
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:35,148
Don't start. "Bring me
another plate of spaghetti. "

690
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:37,150
You're such
a troublemaker.

691
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:39,861
Why doesn't he go to the health
club? Probably can't fit in the door.

692
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:42,697
He does. Barry!

693
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:45,825
Hey, I have no bad feelings
about Lou.

694
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:48,244
I'm glad he's so lucky.

695
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:51,956
You know, I'm glad that somebody's
treating you nice for a change.

696
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,752
I have some time for myself.
It's kinda, you know, it's...

697
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:59,923
When I was with you, I spent
so much time taking care of you,

698
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:03,093
and Lou sometimes
even takes care of me.

699
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:06,262
Um...

700
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:08,515
I don't know.
It's a different lifestyle.

701
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:10,642
You're like a carnival,

702
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:14,771
and he's more like
homogenized milk.

703
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:21,695
Why are you staring at me?

704
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:25,198
I miss you.

705
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:28,451
I miss you too.

706
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,500
What's this hold
you have on me?

707
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,296
Love.

708
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:43,967
I'm sorry. I'm not supposed to
say stuff like that. I forgot.

709
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,512
Barry, what do you want me to
do? Fall in love with you again?

710
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:49,514
Is that what this is about? I
don't want you doing anything.

711
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:54,602
I mean, you're here. That's all I
- I'm happy that you're here.

712
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:58,982
I- I don't know- I have to
go at the end of the day...

713
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:01,317
or tomorrow...

714
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:03,653
and I can't keep coming
back and forth.

715
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:07,657
I- You know,
you've got success.

716
00:40:07,741 --> 00:40:11,327
You know, the most important thing is,
you've got to start loving yourself.

717
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:14,122
You got that. You are good.
You are wonderful.

718
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:18,001
Now, feel it and know
you have to have a life.

719
00:40:18,084 --> 00:40:21,296
Find someone with a soul. Mm-hmm.

720
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:24,466
Don't just fall in love
with some girl's body.

721
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,720
I mean, you do like a
girl's body, didn't you?

722
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:32,974
The only problem was I got
caught. Yeah, what can you do?

723
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:35,268
Maybe you should've stayed
at your mom's that day.

724
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,855
Tony, keep the taper nice
and tight around the waist.

725
00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:41,399
Judge wants to look hot
for his old lady.

726
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:44,569
Don't you think these lapels are
too much for an awards ceremony?

727
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:47,238
Judge, everyone's gonna be wearing
these lapels by this time next year.

728
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:49,657
Wait and see. You need
a shirt to go with that.

729
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:51,868
What do you think about
that referendum coming up?

730
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:54,371
I was gonna ask you the
same question. Perfect.

731
00:40:54,412 --> 00:40:58,083
Throwin' this in free of charge. Gift
from me and Teddy. Very kind of you.

732
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:00,919
Judge, you bring out the
woman in me. You're gorgeous.

733
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:02,921
Hey, good-looking.

734
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:06,716
Tony, why don't you show the
judge back to the dressing rooms.

735
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,844
I'll just take this
up for you. Thank you.

736
00:41:09,928 --> 00:41:13,390
Been out shopping? Buy any
see-through undies? Uh-huh.

737
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:16,768
I thought we'd have
lunch together.

738
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:19,020
Love to, babe.
Having lunch with the judge.

739
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,189
He's gonna help me out with that
zoning variance for the nightclub.

740
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:23,608
Okay, work's important.
What about dinner?

741
00:41:23,692 --> 00:41:26,236
I can't.
Moe Thompson's stag party.

742
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,530
City Council president.
Come on.

743
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:32,992
Make sure there are no women. Hey.

744
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:37,247
Tomorrow night, you and me, dinner,
just the two of us. The Caprice?

745
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:42,085
Promise? Flowers? Mariachi
bands? I promise. Tablecloths.

746
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:44,170
Barry.
Music. What, Vince?

747
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:47,549
Someone you gotta meet. Guess who
this is. Go ahead, guess. What, Vince?

748
00:41:47,632 --> 00:41:49,592
I have no idea.
Your Cousin Al.

749
00:41:49,634 --> 00:41:52,387
No. What a joker.
Jeff, say something.

750
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,724
What is this, performing seal
time? Cut another caller off.

751
00:41:57,726 --> 00:42:00,729
You're history. Ptt!
You're on Talk of the Town.

752
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:04,274
You're Jeff Fisher.

753
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:07,318
In my store. I can't believe it.
I listen to your show all the time.

754
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,613
You're great, man. You look
different than I thought.

755
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:14,409
You thought I'd be 6'2", in spurs? Yeah.

756
00:42:14,492 --> 00:42:17,245
This is my wife, Ellen.
Nice to meet you.

757
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:21,791
- Yeah, the craziest people
call in that show.

758
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:23,460
I think of calling
myself sometimes.

759
00:42:23,543 --> 00:42:27,213
You're too shy, right?
I can tell.

760
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:29,632
Don't I listen all the
time? He thinks you're God.

761
00:42:29,674 --> 00:42:32,969
Thank you, sir. Wish we had
your picture. We could put it up.

762
00:42:33,053 --> 00:42:35,221
I'll send you one.
You've got quite a voice.

763
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:37,223
Voice?
You ever do radio?

764
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:40,602
I've thought of doing some
radio. Only came in for a second.

765
00:42:40,685 --> 00:42:43,813
I gotta run. Listen, Vince,
send the jacket to my home.

766
00:42:43,855 --> 00:42:47,567
- Uh- Uh- What's your name?
- Barry. Barry Golden. Yeah.

767
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:50,528
Anytime you're in the
neighborhood, stop by the station.

768
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:52,989
Love to show you around, let you
say a couple of words, Yeah, sure.

769
00:42:53,031 --> 00:42:55,450
sell some suits,
plug the store.

770
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:58,953
My secretary'll send the picture. Don't
forget the sleeves. Nice meeting you.

771
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:00,497
Bye-bye!
Bye!

772
00:43:00,538 --> 00:43:04,334
The topic is
fantasy love affairs.

773
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:07,545
Who would you like to have
a love affair with?

774
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:11,508
We're here with our good friend,
Barry. What's your name this week?

775
00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:15,011
Barry Champlaign, man. Barry
Champlaign, man, is here,

776
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:17,597
and he has said "his wife." Mm-hmm.

777
00:43:17,681 --> 00:43:19,599
These are supposed to be
famous people,

778
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:22,018
unless your wife's gotten around
a lot more than I think she has.

779
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:24,145
Come on. Your wife's
not listening, okay?

780
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:27,107
Who would you really like to
get up close and personal with?

781
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:31,403
Marie Osmond, I think, is very
sexy. That's one for Marie Osmond.

782
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:35,240
In black leather, yeah.
The studio fish is blushing.

783
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:39,244
She is sex incarnate, man.
She's a Mormon, isn't she?

784
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:43,915
Mormons believe in bigamy. Marie,
I want to marry you right now.

785
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:47,377
Come down to the station.
I want you, Marie.

786
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,548
Okay! We'll take another caller.
Yeah, you're on Talk of the Town.

787
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:55,719
Yeah, you know what I think? You
two are a couple of liberal pinkos.

788
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,598
That's what I think. Are you
two homos? Is that what you are?

789
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:02,600
You know what you are,
my friend, you are history.

790
00:44:02,684 --> 00:44:05,562
Wait.
The caller has a point.

791
00:44:05,603 --> 00:44:08,398
It's true, sir, indeed,
Jeff Fisher and I are lovers.

792
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,485
Have been for the last 15 years. In
fact, we're holding hands right now.

793
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:15,321
Probably nigger lovers too.
Yeah, what race are you, sir?

794
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:17,323
I'm white,
and I'm proud of it.

795
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:20,285
As one white man to another,
let me ask you a question.

796
00:44:20,368 --> 00:44:24,247
Do you know how much white Americans
spend every year on suntan lotion?

797
00:44:24,289 --> 00:44:29,294
$165 million!

798
00:44:29,377 --> 00:44:31,921
That's a lot of money to spend
just to turn brown.

799
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:34,466
You know why they wanna turn
brown? Jeff, do you know why?

800
00:44:34,549 --> 00:44:37,135
Let's take another caller.
This is an interesting question.

801
00:44:37,218 --> 00:44:40,263
They wanna turn brown because
they secretly want to be black.

802
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:42,390
You know why they wanna be black?
These and other questions...

803
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:44,392
Because they feel
sexually inferior.

804
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:46,936
You're a smart-mouth homo.
That's what you are.

805
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,105
Okay, okay.
You're an inbred throwback...

806
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:54,319
Ha-hoo! It's a Texas rodeo, yes
indeed. We'll hose 'em down...

807
00:44:54,402 --> 00:44:57,947
and be right back
after this commercial break.

808
00:45:01,493 --> 00:45:03,912
When I say "cut, "
you stop talking.

809
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:09,584
We've been through this before.
You're fun and the audience likes you,

810
00:45:09,668 --> 00:45:12,295
but I'm not gonna lose
my license over this shit.

811
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:14,631
Why would you lose
your license?

812
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:18,510
It's called Standards and Prac
- Jeff, pick up seven.

813
00:45:18,593 --> 00:45:23,306
Thank you. Standards and Practices.
You ever heard of it? Yeah?

814
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,102
Oh, he's funny, yeah.

815
00:45:27,185 --> 00:45:29,270
Yeah, right, yeah, sure.

816
00:45:29,354 --> 00:45:31,690
Sells suits.

817
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:34,150
Tomorrow at 10:00?

818
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:36,653
I'll ask him.
Hold on.

819
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:40,573
Can you come in tomorrow
morning, meet the boss at 10:00?

820
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:42,492
- What for?
What I would do is...

821
00:45:42,534 --> 00:45:44,744
have a swimming pool
and a sauna...

822
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:47,038
Boring. Come on,
you could do better than that.

823
00:45:47,122 --> 00:45:49,165
Line four. Nancy, what would
you do with a million bucks?

824
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:51,209
Barry,
I just love your show.

825
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:54,671
Send me your measurements and a nude
photograph, and I'll get back to you.

826
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:56,631
Line one, Frank in Grapevine.
Yeah, Frank?

827
00:45:56,715 --> 00:45:59,759
I'm a Chicano-
Good for you. I'm a Jew.

828
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:03,013
Now, this is serious, dude.
Wrong show.

829
00:46:03,054 --> 00:46:07,559
Look, Stu, I don't think we've had a decent
answer to this question all night long.

830
00:46:07,642 --> 00:46:11,187
Now, come on, people,
you gotta give me a good answer,

831
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:13,189
Yeah, hold on.
or I'm gonna punish ya.

832
00:46:13,231 --> 00:46:15,108
Okay, let's go to...

833
00:46:15,191 --> 00:46:18,778
Let's go to
- Here, talk to Barry. Come on. Talk to Barry.

834
00:46:18,862 --> 00:46:22,782
Line one, you're on. Say something,
anything. Ready? Say something.

835
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:27,203
Say something. Uh,
yeah, this is Cheryl Ann.

836
00:46:27,245 --> 00:46:30,331
What are you gonna do with
a million bucks, Cheryl Ann?

837
00:46:30,415 --> 00:46:34,336
If I had a million bucks, I would
buy my own radio transmitter...

838
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:36,629
and start my own
talk show,

839
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:39,049
so I wouldn't have to listen
to your voice.

840
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:42,344
If you hate my voice so much,
why don't you change the station?

841
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:45,180
I can't.
Why not.

842
00:46:45,263 --> 00:46:49,559
I'm in prison, and the warden
picks the shows we listen to.

843
00:46:49,642 --> 00:46:52,312
Good. You're Iying. You love my voice.

844
00:46:52,395 --> 00:46:54,731
I hate your voice.
You love my voice.

845
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:58,526
It's a love-hate situation. You
can't get enough of my voice.

846
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:01,780
Come on. Admit it.
You're full of it!

847
00:47:01,863 --> 00:47:04,824
If you don't love my voice,
then hang up. Come on. Hang up.

848
00:47:04,908 --> 00:47:07,369
You love me. Come on.
Hang up. Hang up!

849
00:47:07,452 --> 00:47:10,747
I hate you,
Barry Champlaign!

850
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:13,291
Beautiful. I love it.

851
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:17,045
Not good enough. Folks,
you let me down once again.

852
00:47:17,128 --> 00:47:19,464
For that,
you must be punished.

853
00:47:19,547 --> 00:47:23,051
This is the Bee Gees, and this
one's going out to you, Cheryl Ann,

854
00:47:23,134 --> 00:47:27,138
singing "Saturday Night Fever"
ten times in a row.

855
00:47:27,222 --> 00:47:30,767
- Best call we've had in
a couple of weeks, I swear.

856
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:33,561
That was great, honey. We gotta
get Cheryl Ann calling more often.

857
00:47:33,645 --> 00:47:36,147
They're eating this stuff up, Barry.
See that piece in the paper today?

858
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:39,734
The thing about me looking for
a bodyguard? Great publicity.

859
00:47:39,818 --> 00:47:41,903
You want this ten times
in a row, seriously?

860
00:47:41,986 --> 00:47:44,197
No, make it three times.
I'll be back in a minute.

861
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,324
Three it is.
Beautiful show. I love it.

862
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:48,326
# Burn, baby, burn #

863
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:52,956
# Burn, baby, burn #
In here?

864
00:47:53,998 --> 00:47:55,959
Ooh.

865
00:48:09,305 --> 00:48:12,600
That was great.
The kiss or the call?

866
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:16,021
Dan just gave me
some good news.

867
00:48:16,104 --> 00:48:18,314
I'm getting
the 10:00 a.m. slot.

868
00:48:18,356 --> 00:48:20,692
He's hiring a producer
just for my own show.

869
00:48:20,775 --> 00:48:26,197
Oh, Barry, that's wonderful.
Yeah. You wanna do it?

870
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:29,826
Huh? You'd be the best person to do it.

871
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:34,956
You're smart, you're hardworking,
you do everything I tell you to do.

872
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,836
Um, Barry, I think you
better get someone else.

873
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:43,465
I don't think it's a good
idea. It's a great idea.

874
00:48:43,506 --> 00:48:45,091
Come on.
You gotta do it.

875
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:49,679
No, I don't think so. Do
it. Come on. I need you.

876
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:55,310
Barry, if I work for you, the
fun would go out it, you know?

877
00:48:55,352 --> 00:48:59,314
There'd be a lot of tension. It
might even screw up our marriage.

878
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:03,818
Fuck our marriage. Come on.
This is important. I need you.

879
00:49:03,902 --> 00:49:07,489
Don't you want the show to be as good
as it can be? Aren't you behind me?

880
00:49:07,572 --> 00:49:11,868
You gotta be joking.
Of course I'm not joking.

881
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:14,329
You just said,
"Fuck our marriage."

882
00:49:16,998 --> 00:49:18,917
I'm joking.

883
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,420
This is getting really boring.
I'm gonna switch it, all right?

884
00:49:25,298 --> 00:49:27,217
I just thought that...

885
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:30,929
Forget it.

886
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,520
I'm very proud of you.

887
00:49:40,438 --> 00:49:42,524
It's wonderful for you.

888
00:49:44,734 --> 00:49:46,695
Come on. Okay?

889
00:49:47,987 --> 00:49:51,282
Hmm?
Come on. Okay?

890
00:49:59,457 --> 00:50:05,046
Barry?

891
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:07,590
Baby, I don't wanna go
in the sink.

892
00:50:07,632 --> 00:50:09,884
Yeah! In the sink!

893
00:50:13,388 --> 00:50:15,640
I don't wanna go
in the sink.

894
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:18,685
Oh-ho!
Hi, Ellen!

895
00:50:18,768 --> 00:50:21,062
Hi, Stu.

896
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:24,065
Are you having a party?
Yeah, a sink party.

897
00:50:25,817 --> 00:50:30,822
Oh, uh, hi, hon. My mother wasn't
feeling well, so I decided to come home.

898
00:50:32,157 --> 00:50:35,035
Ellen, I thought you
and your mother were...

899
00:50:36,244 --> 00:50:38,621
uh-
Eh...

900
00:50:38,705 --> 00:50:42,417
Um, what...

901
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:44,586
what are you two up to?

902
00:50:46,379 --> 00:50:50,300
Look, I better go out and
come back in. Barry, come back.

903
00:50:51,384 --> 00:50:54,637
You cut me off!

904
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:58,892
Hey, Theresa, come here.
Come with Stuey,

905
00:50:58,975 --> 00:51:03,772
and have a Stuey sandwich
with Mimi and Stuey.

906
00:51:16,659 --> 00:51:18,119
You want one?

907
00:51:18,161 --> 00:51:20,121
No.

908
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:43,019
He became a millionaire.
How about that?

909
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:45,313
Brings back memories.

910
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:49,401
A lot of changes. I'm
nicer, I make more money...

911
00:51:49,484 --> 00:51:51,820
and I only hang up
on one out of seven.

912
00:51:51,903 --> 00:51:56,533
...with Dallas' own Mr.
Popularity, Barry Champlaign.

913
00:51:56,616 --> 00:52:00,078
I'm Sidney Greenberg, reminding
you that it's not how much you take,

914
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:03,123
it's how much
you take home.

915
00:52:03,206 --> 00:52:05,125
Hey!

916
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:08,336
How's Chicago? You look great.
Great. You look great too.

917
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,380
Ellen, what are you
doing here?

918
00:52:10,422 --> 00:52:13,008
I couldn't miss
Barry's premiere.

919
00:52:13,091 --> 00:52:16,136
Yeah, we only have a couple of
minutes. You mind if I steal Barry?

920
00:52:16,219 --> 00:52:19,014
You know where the green room is.
Have a cup of coffee. We'll catch up.

921
00:52:19,097 --> 00:52:21,057
Sure. Bye.

922
00:52:26,104 --> 00:52:30,066
Evening, Barry. I have
two minutes. What is it?

923
00:52:30,108 --> 00:52:33,820
I'll make it brief. I know
you've got your show to do.

924
00:52:33,903 --> 00:52:37,323
Barry, we've run into some
slight scheduling problems...

925
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:39,325
concerning
the national feed.

926
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:42,454
We're gonna have to delay it
for at least a couple of weeks.

927
00:52:49,794 --> 00:52:52,297
Hi, Stuey.

928
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:56,051
Ellen! Holy cow!
I knew you'd show up.

929
00:52:56,134 --> 00:53:01,389
Jesus, let me look at you here. Are
you taking young pills or something?

930
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:03,641
Wanna step into my crib
with me? You must be excited.

931
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:05,810
Oh, yeah, I'm jumping out
of my skin. You kidding me?

932
00:53:05,894 --> 00:53:08,813
I called my mother and told her we're
gonna broadcast all over the country.

933
00:53:08,897 --> 00:53:12,859
She says, "Stuart, that's
beautiful. What country?"

934
00:53:12,942 --> 00:53:15,362
Good to see you.
It's good to see you.

935
00:53:15,445 --> 00:53:18,573
Hi, I'm Laura Nicholson. I
spoke to you on the phone. Hi.

936
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:20,992
Oh, it's nice to meet you.
You must be Barry's secretary.

937
00:53:21,076 --> 00:53:25,830
No, actually, I'm his producer. We're
going in a few seconds. Excuse me.

938
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:32,170
Let's go. From the heart
of the Lone Star state,

939
00:53:32,253 --> 00:53:36,508
it's time for Dallas' most
popular talk show, Night Talk...

940
00:53:36,591 --> 00:53:40,970
- with Barry Champlaign.
- # Bad to bone #

941
00:53:41,012 --> 00:53:44,891
The KGAB phone lines are open
and ready for your call...

942
00:53:44,974 --> 00:53:46,935
at 555-TALK.

943
00:53:46,976 --> 00:53:51,648
Nice to meet you. Nice to
meet you. Isn't this exciting?

944
00:53:51,731 --> 00:53:53,274
I've just received
some terrible news.

945
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:55,610
Night Talk will not be broadcast
nationally tonight...

946
00:53:55,694 --> 00:53:58,571
due to the usual corporate,
big business, inefficiency,

947
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,490
sloppiness and bureaucracy.

948
00:54:00,573 --> 00:54:02,742
I've just been informed
of a scheduling problem.

949
00:54:02,826 --> 00:54:05,954
Nothing personal, nothing
logical, just business as usual.

950
00:54:06,037 --> 00:54:10,458
Maybe the show will go national
next week, maybe next month.

951
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,919
No one seems to know.
I'm sorry.

952
00:54:13,003 --> 00:54:16,006
I feel I've let you,
the listeners, down.

953
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:17,966
But I've been in this business long
enough to know you can lose the battle...

954
00:54:18,008 --> 00:54:19,968
and still win the war.

955
00:54:20,176 --> 00:54:24,514
Night Talk still has a purpose,
a standard to which it must rise,

956
00:54:24,597 --> 00:54:27,183
and I will not let you down
on that score.

957
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:30,478
This show is about saying
what's got to be said.

958
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,564
That's what
we're gonna do here tonight.

959
00:54:32,647 --> 00:54:34,816
Tonight, anything goes.

960
00:54:34,899 --> 00:54:38,653
I wanna hear you. I want you to
tell me what you really think.

961
00:54:38,737 --> 00:54:43,658
No holds barred. Call
555-TALK. I'm sorry.

962
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:49,122
The door is open.
Hit me with your best shot.

963
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:53,835
Night Talk.
Jerry from Rockwell.

964
00:54:54,919 --> 00:54:56,880
You're on.
Barry.

965
00:54:56,963 --> 00:54:59,549
Have you ever entertained
one single doubt...

966
00:54:59,632 --> 00:55:01,551
about the truth
of the Holocaust?

967
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,228
I think we've had
this conversation before, sir.

968
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:15,774
When you make these accusations against Jews,
when you start questioning the Holocaust,

969
00:55:15,857 --> 00:55:19,194
I think you should have some facts
available, and the facts are available.

970
00:55:19,277 --> 00:55:22,530
Well, of course. We'd love to
sit down and debate them with you.

971
00:55:22,614 --> 00:55:25,033
Uh-huh. Well, who's "we"? Am
I talking to a "we" or a "you"?

972
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:27,494
Well, Barry, we're
organized in our belief...

973
00:55:27,577 --> 00:55:30,622
the same way the Zionists
are organized in their belief.

974
00:55:30,705 --> 00:55:33,667
We could debate it. It would
be very easy and simple.

975
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,252
It would be far more simple and
valuable for you to get in touch with,

976
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:38,463
let's say, the Holocaust
Museum down in Washington.

977
00:55:38,546 --> 00:55:40,465
Uh-huh. They'll send you
the names of all the Jews...

978
00:55:40,548 --> 00:55:42,467
who died during World War ll.

979
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:46,096
They have all this information. I mean, the
first one to say if somebody made a mistake...

980
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:50,058
They say six million died? It could've
been five million or seven million.

981
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,477
It could be two also.

982
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:56,231
Is that the issue? That two
million innocent people died?

983
00:55:56,314 --> 00:55:59,776
Why should one single innocent
person die, Jew or non-Jew? I agree.

984
00:55:59,859 --> 00:56:04,489
But the Zionists are using this issue
and the guilt on the American public...

985
00:56:04,572 --> 00:56:06,491
to extort from us
our tax dollars.

986
00:56:06,574 --> 00:56:09,494
The figures we have say
every family in Israel...

987
00:56:09,577 --> 00:56:12,622
gets over$10, 000
of our taxes.

988
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:15,208
Well, you'll never see more
collective poverty than in Israel.

989
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:18,545
I urge you to take a trip there. All you
got to do, Barry, is go to West Virginia.

990
00:56:18,628 --> 00:56:21,506
What does West Virginia have to
do with it? Or Nebraska or Idaho,

991
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:24,426
where you'll see farmer after
farmer biting the dust, Mm-hmm.

992
00:56:24,467 --> 00:56:26,720
losing their farms, can't
get decent loans. Yeah.

993
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:29,097
If we had the loans and grants
that are sent to Israel,

994
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:32,642
we wouldn't be losing our farms,
which is the backbone of this country.

995
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:35,937
And what if a woman competes with you
in the marketplace and takes your job?

996
00:56:35,979 --> 00:56:39,107
What if black men start dating
and marrying white women? Oh!

997
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:41,109
And what if homosexuals
are teaching your children?

998
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:43,111
And what if you're afraid
to walk the streets at night?

999
00:56:43,153 --> 00:56:46,031
What if you see yuppies getting rich while
you're standing in the unemployment line?

1000
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:48,950
And what if your government
sends you to Vietnam...

1001
00:56:48,992 --> 00:56:51,453
to fight a war they have
no chance of winning?

1002
00:56:51,494 --> 00:56:54,622
And what if your country
is slipping away, lost?

1003
00:56:54,664 --> 00:56:56,666
I know the argument, friend.

1004
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:00,295
It's the great theory of
history. I've heard it before.

1005
00:57:00,378 --> 00:57:02,339
It says,
"When things ain't good,

1006
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,549
"instead of getting down
and doing something about it,

1007
00:57:04,632 --> 00:57:08,053
instead of changing your life, it's a hell
of a lot easier to blame somebody else."

1008
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:10,055
And it just don't wash
in my book.

1009
00:57:10,138 --> 00:57:12,599
Well, that's a very nice
speech, Barry, Mm-hmm.

1010
00:57:12,682 --> 00:57:16,144
but it seems to me you're making
pretty good money on that station.

1011
00:57:16,227 --> 00:57:18,480
And since you're an outsider
to these parts and all,

1012
00:57:18,563 --> 00:57:21,399
it seems difficult, I guess, to relate
to the common-folk problems out here.

1013
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:24,527
There is no room for self-pity,
sir, in my life or yours.

1014
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:28,573
Now, you ought to read the Turner Diaries,
Barry, by William Pierce. It's all there.

1015
00:57:28,656 --> 00:57:30,575
Mm-hmm.
It says...

1016
00:57:30,658 --> 00:57:32,786
Yes, I'm familiar with that novel
- a product of the enlightened man.

1017
00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:36,122
Now, let me finish!
Barry, I got Beauty on five.

1018
00:57:36,206 --> 00:57:39,209
What it does is lays out the plan
for the coming revolution. Mm-hmm.

1019
00:57:39,292 --> 00:57:43,254
See, the word "America, "Barry, means
"heavenly kingdom" in the gothic language.

1020
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:45,674
Yeah. It's the real new
Jerusalem of Scripture.

1021
00:57:45,757 --> 00:57:48,259
It shows you how the Jews
are impostors who took...

1022
00:57:48,343 --> 00:57:50,637
Yeah, yeah, yeah. For those
of you who don't know it,

1023
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,100
it starts idiotically enough in
the year 1991. That's correct.

1024
00:57:55,183 --> 00:57:59,229
It's written as a diary by a young,
white, racist, electrical engineer...

1025
00:57:59,312 --> 00:58:02,232
who joins an underground
paramilitary organization...

1026
00:58:02,315 --> 00:58:04,651
known as "The Order."
That's right.

1027
00:58:04,734 --> 00:58:06,695
Oh, am I doing all right?
Oh, great.

1028
00:58:06,736 --> 00:58:09,072
They institute a revolution
against ZOG,

1029
00:58:09,155 --> 00:58:12,367
the Zionist Occupied Government
of America.

1030
00:58:12,409 --> 00:58:15,578
And along the way, they kill
all the mongrel races...

1031
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:18,581
Jews, blacks,
homosexuals, feminists...

1032
00:58:18,665 --> 00:58:20,959
and other mud people.

1033
00:58:21,042 --> 00:58:23,670
It's an idiotic book written for
people with bubble gum brains...

1034
00:58:23,753 --> 00:58:26,172
who never got out of the fourth
grade, watching reruns of The Blob.

1035
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:28,967
Easy, Barry.
You're part of the problem.

1036
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:31,136
You're another Jew,
another weed-eating Jew,

1037
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:33,138
in control of the media
of this country.

1038
00:58:33,221 --> 00:58:36,933
And from there, you pass judgement
on that which you don't know.

1039
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:40,645
And there will come a day for you,
Barry, and thousands of others like you...

1040
00:58:40,729 --> 00:58:43,314
who have slept with black women,
who have lied to us...

1041
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:46,568
when you will hang from your neck
with a placard around it saying,

1042
00:58:46,609 --> 00:58:49,571
"I betrayed my race. "

1043
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:55,869
Well, what can you say to
a paranoid schizophrenic...

1044
00:58:55,952 --> 00:58:58,955
who's a coward for hanging up, except
that I guess the day that I hang,

1045
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:01,666
I'll probably defend the asshole
who hung me.

1046
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:06,004
Talk radio. Free speech
isn't really free at all.

1047
00:59:06,087 --> 00:59:09,549
It's actually a little bit like Russian
roulette. A very expensive commodity.

1048
00:59:09,632 --> 00:59:12,093
You never know what's gonna come up
the next time you push the button.

1049
00:59:12,135 --> 00:59:14,512
Yeah, you're on Night Talk.
I changed my name...

1050
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:17,557
and didn't have any trouble
getting Social Security.

1051
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:20,935
My birth certificate has
my name spelled differently.

1052
00:59:20,977 --> 00:59:23,188
And I-
Hello?

1053
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:26,941
Yeah, it's very interesting.
What's your view on lesbian priests?

1054
00:59:27,025 --> 00:59:29,611
My view on what?
How about masturbation?

1055
00:59:29,694 --> 00:59:31,738
You got any view on that?
No, I don't.

1056
00:59:31,821 --> 00:59:34,866
How about that law in Arizona
where it's a felony...

1057
00:59:34,949 --> 00:59:36,910
to go around with
an erection in your pants?

1058
00:59:36,993 --> 00:59:40,413
What do you think about that? Well,
I-I'm not really calling about that.

1059
00:59:40,497 --> 00:59:42,248
Mm-hmm. If they wanna
do it, let 'em do it.

1060
00:59:42,332 --> 00:59:44,250
Yeah, what?

1061
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:46,294
Kent's on three. I don't
think you should take the call.

1062
00:59:46,336 --> 00:59:48,963
Lose him, Barry.
Barry? Hello?

1063
00:59:49,047 --> 00:59:52,133
Yeah, yeah. Well, that's just fine
for you. Tell him to shoot it to me.

1064
00:59:52,175 --> 00:59:54,469
Hello, Barry? Hello?
Well, good, good.

1065
00:59:54,552 --> 00:59:56,763
That's good for you.

1066
00:59:56,846 --> 00:59:58,973
Gee, tonight's just
a walk down memory lane.

1067
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:01,309
And we have Kent with us
once again.

1068
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:04,604
Yeah, Kent. I didn't
mean to hang up on you.

1069
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:08,191
Yeah, but you did. Listen, Kent,
you're a fake. You're a hoax.

1070
01:00:08,274 --> 01:00:10,777
You call up with some fake-o story
about how you and your girlfriend...

1071
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,113
are taking drugs
and she's O.D.'d...

1072
01:00:13,196 --> 01:00:15,281
and your parents are in Acapulco. Fiji.

1073
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:17,283
Oh, Fiji, right.
An important detail.

1074
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:19,703
You're just this poor, mixed-up
kid. You don't know what to do.

1075
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:23,748
I think she's dead!
What are you trying to tell me?

1076
01:00:23,832 --> 01:00:26,668
That your girlfriend O.D.'d? Now
she's dead? I don't know, okay?

1077
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:31,006
I just can't get her to wake
up! Yeah, we heard that already.

1078
01:00:31,047 --> 01:00:33,091
There's foam coming
out of her mouth. What?

1079
01:00:33,174 --> 01:00:35,427
Foam coming out of her mouth.

1080
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:38,680
Let's dump this guy, now.
It's Barry's show, boss.

1081
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:40,682
That's it. That's it.
Listen!

1082
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:42,934
My parents are in Fiji,
okay?

1083
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:46,312
And the stuff about my girlfriend
- Yeah, what?

1084
01:00:46,396 --> 01:00:48,481
She
- Come on, Kent. Spit it out.

1085
01:00:48,565 --> 01:00:51,818
No, you'll cut me off!
I won't cut you off, Kent.

1086
01:00:51,901 --> 01:00:54,696
You promise?

1087
01:00:54,779 --> 01:00:57,866
I promise I won't
cut you off, Kent.

1088
01:00:59,951 --> 01:01:04,039
I made the whole thing up!

1089
01:01:11,463 --> 01:01:13,965
Kent? I lied. I'm cutting you off. What?

1090
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:16,634
Get the hell out of here. No,
please! Look, I'm not Iying!

1091
01:01:16,718 --> 01:01:18,678
I gotta talk to you.
You gotta talk to me?

1092
01:01:18,762 --> 01:01:21,139
What are you gonna talk about?
Your mother just slit her wrists?

1093
01:01:21,222 --> 01:01:23,141
She's bleeding to death?

1094
01:01:23,224 --> 01:01:25,977
How about your father? Got a shotgun
in his mouth? Gonna blow his brains out?

1095
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:28,521
Tell me, who else is dead?
Come on. Who's dead, Kent?

1096
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:30,815
Who's dead? Who's dead?
Tell me, who's dead?

1097
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:33,068
No one's dead!
No one's dead, Barry.

1098
01:01:33,151 --> 01:01:35,111
Come on. Look.

1099
01:01:35,153 --> 01:01:37,739
I just wanted to talk. We're
talking. You got two seconds. Talk.

1100
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:40,617
Okay, I listen to you all
the time, you know. Mm-hmm.

1101
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:43,411
I think about what you say, Bar. Yeah.

1102
01:01:43,495 --> 01:01:46,206
You say such cool stuff.
Mm-hmm.

1103
01:01:46,289 --> 01:01:49,125
Well, I just didn't know
what to say, you know.

1104
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:53,088
Look, I wanted to meet you.

1105
01:01:53,129 --> 01:01:55,215
Now you're goofing on me.
You wanted to meet me?

1106
01:01:55,298 --> 01:01:58,551
You can meet me anytime you want.
I'm right here in the station.

1107
01:01:58,635 --> 01:02:01,096
You're at the station? I'm not
the president, for God's sakes.

1108
01:02:01,137 --> 01:02:03,431
I'm right here, downtown,
in the studio.

1109
01:02:03,473 --> 01:02:06,226
So I could just come down?
You could just come down.

1110
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:08,728
Now? Right now?
Now.

1111
01:02:10,063 --> 01:02:12,440
What do you mean, right now? Right now.

1112
01:02:12,524 --> 01:02:16,236
I'll just come down.
I'm on the air, Kent.

1113
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:19,489
Please?

1114
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:23,326
Sure, Kent. Why not?
Come on down. Really?

1115
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,328
I'd love to meet you.
Just hurry up. Allright!

1116
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:27,789
I'm halfway through the show. We're
at the end of the first hour...

1117
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:30,750
of exciting and intellectual
conversation here on Night Talk.

1118
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:32,961
Don't go away. We have the
news and the weather coming up.

1119
01:02:33,044 --> 01:02:35,463
And then we'll be back
with more Night Talk.

1120
01:02:37,507 --> 01:02:39,467
Barry.
Dan.

1121
01:02:39,509 --> 01:02:41,594
Laura, call down and tell
Security there's a kid coming.

1122
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:44,097
Dan, you want anything?
Coffee? Tea? Insulin?

1123
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:46,099
Crack?
We have it all right here.

1124
01:02:46,182 --> 01:02:48,643
Barry, you should ask me if you
wanna have a guest on the show.

1125
01:02:48,685 --> 01:02:51,312
Why? 'Cause I'm the
boss, Barry. That's why.

1126
01:02:51,396 --> 01:02:53,648
Dan, I'll do my job,
you do yours, okay?

1127
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:55,775
He is not coming on the show.
That's it. We have too much riding...

1128
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:58,695
on what's going on here tonight.
What's going on here tonight?

1129
01:02:58,778 --> 01:03:02,115
If they think for one minute that
you're undependable, it's over.

1130
01:03:02,198 --> 01:03:04,534
Dan, Metro Wave bought my show.
All right?

1131
01:03:04,617 --> 01:03:07,412
This is my show.
I put who I want on my show.

1132
01:03:07,495 --> 01:03:10,123
If I wanna have Charlie Manson on
my show, I'll put him on the show.

1133
01:03:10,206 --> 01:03:13,084
Or Ted Bundy
- Or how about this. I have David Berkowitz,

1134
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:15,128
Bernard Goetz,
John Hinckley on.

1135
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:17,797
We do a special on gun
control. How would that be?

1136
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:20,842
Or how about that postman from
Oklahoma who killed 14 people, Dan?

1137
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:23,678
He killed his boss. We
bring him on the show. Cut.

1138
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:25,764
We bring you on as a
special guest. Out. Out.

1139
01:03:25,847 --> 01:03:28,308
We're gonna bring these guys on the
show. We'll have a terrific show.

1140
01:03:28,391 --> 01:03:30,518
Oh, boy, this'll be great.

1141
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:33,438
That's funny stuff, Barry,
the mailman who killed his boss.

1142
01:03:33,521 --> 01:03:36,191
Did you see what the mailman
brought me today?

1143
01:03:36,232 --> 01:03:38,360
Huh?

1144
01:03:38,401 --> 01:03:41,029
We got half the wackos
within 20 miles of this place...

1145
01:03:41,112 --> 01:03:43,907
saying how much they wanna
"burn your Jew ass."

1146
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:47,911
Think about that, Barry. The time it
takes to sit down and write that on paper,

1147
01:03:47,994 --> 01:03:50,330
put it in an envelope, lick
it, send it to the station.

1148
01:03:50,413 --> 01:03:52,874
And I've got boxes
of this shit in my office.

1149
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:56,044
These people
are dead serious.

1150
01:03:56,086 --> 01:03:59,547
All I'm suggesting is that you simply
pull it back, just for a little bit.

1151
01:03:59,631 --> 01:04:01,549
I think you're a little
out of your depth, Dan.

1152
01:04:01,633 --> 01:04:04,969
I think it's time
- Just stop talking and listen to me for two minutes!

1153
01:04:05,053 --> 01:04:06,971
You don't have an audience
in here now to cheer you on.

1154
01:04:07,055 --> 01:04:10,892
You do whatever you want to tonight,
Barry. Have fun. Blow the deal.

1155
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:13,436
I'm not gonna say I don't care,
because I worked very hard on this.

1156
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:16,940
- I worked my ass off on this.
- This is my life you're talking about.

1157
01:04:17,023 --> 01:04:21,820
No, what you are, Barry, is a fucking
suit salesman with a big mouth.

1158
01:04:21,903 --> 01:04:24,239
Let's call a spade a spade.

1159
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,449
It's a job.
That's all it is.

1160
01:04:26,533 --> 01:04:29,035
You can come in here and start predicting
Armageddon if you want to, Barry.

1161
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:31,079
But it's still a job.

1162
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:33,915
A job you did not even know
how to do...

1163
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:35,959
until I taught it to you!

1164
01:04:36,042 --> 01:04:38,878
What do you think you're doing
in here, changing the world?

1165
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:42,924
This is a talk show, Barry,
and you are a talk show host.

1166
01:04:43,008 --> 01:04:46,094
Alan does the drive time, Jerry
does the home handyman stuff,

1167
01:04:46,177 --> 01:04:50,098
Sheila does the shrink stuff, Sid does the
financial stuff, and you hang up on people.

1168
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,308
That's your job.

1169
01:04:52,392 --> 01:04:54,477
Now, you're very good at it.
You're the joker in my deck,

1170
01:04:54,561 --> 01:04:56,855
and I'm very happy
for your success.

1171
01:04:56,938 --> 01:04:58,857
But you work for me!

1172
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:00,859
I'm your boss.

1173
01:05:02,944 --> 01:05:05,905
You wanna have the kid
on the show? Have him on!

1174
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:09,075
But you get one thing straight.
You fuck up my deal,

1175
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:11,870
and you go back to selling
double-knit suits.

1176
01:05:25,091 --> 01:05:27,052
I'm glad you take it
all so seriously, Barry,

1177
01:05:27,135 --> 01:05:29,888
but you gotta learn when to stop
or it's gonna kill you.

1178
01:05:34,517 --> 01:05:38,355
Go get the kid. The kid
is not a good idea, Barry.

1179
01:05:38,438 --> 01:05:41,149
You're on his side, aren't you? No,
I want you to think about the show.

1180
01:05:41,232 --> 01:05:45,820
You could lose everything that you've
worked for and everything I've worked for.

1181
01:05:45,904 --> 01:05:47,947
Get the kid.

1182
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,116
It's very important to Barry.

1183
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:52,160
It's a very important moment
in his life.

1184
01:05:52,243 --> 01:05:55,121
Yes, he is important to me.
He is important.

1185
01:05:57,707 --> 01:06:00,669
Look, Lou,
he's a fuckin' basket case.

1186
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:03,505
Lou- Allright, allright.
Forget it. Forget it.

1187
01:06:03,546 --> 01:06:07,217
I'll just stay to see the show tonight,
and then I'll be home tomorrow, okay?

1188
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:09,511
Love you.

1189
01:06:09,594 --> 01:06:11,971
Yeah. Hey.

1190
01:06:12,055 --> 01:06:14,349
Just pretend I'm visiting
a sick relative.

1191
01:06:14,432 --> 01:06:16,434
All right?

1192
01:06:16,518 --> 01:06:18,895
Bye.

1193
01:06:18,978 --> 01:06:20,897
Yeah.

1194
01:06:27,904 --> 01:06:30,907
Night Talk. We're back. This is
the spirit of Barry Champlaign.

1195
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:33,785
Joe, hit me with your
best shot. Yeah, Barry.

1196
01:06:33,868 --> 01:06:36,246
I've been driving a cab now
for about 11 years.

1197
01:06:36,329 --> 01:06:39,416
I've met all kinds. I
know people. I wish I did.

1198
01:06:39,499 --> 01:06:41,418
Let me tell you
something, friend.

1199
01:06:41,501 --> 01:06:45,296
That kid who just called, what he
needs is a good bust in the chops.

1200
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:48,717
Think that would do it, Joe? Kid
like that needs some discipline.

1201
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,928
Discipline?
I got two kids, Barry.

1202
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:55,015
They give me any trouble,
I just take off my belt.

1203
01:06:55,098 --> 01:06:57,392
They see the belt,
that's it.

1204
01:06:57,434 --> 01:07:02,355
How old are your children, Joe? Little
girl's five, boy's three and a half.

1205
01:07:02,439 --> 01:07:07,402
You hit them with a belt?
Brush, belt, newspaper. Whatever.

1206
01:07:07,485 --> 01:07:11,239
Hey, they're either gonna get it from
me or they're gonna get it out there.

1207
01:07:11,322 --> 01:07:14,242
Joe, I think you need
professional help. What's that?

1208
01:07:14,284 --> 01:07:16,244
You need to get together with
Jerry. He can hold them down...

1209
01:07:16,286 --> 01:07:18,580
while you hit them with a belt.
What the hell are you talking about?

1210
01:07:18,663 --> 01:07:21,082
You're hitting your kids with
brushes and belts. You're psychotic.

1211
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:24,753
You're a psycho. Yeah? And
what are you, friend, a faggot?

1212
01:07:24,794 --> 01:07:27,922
Coming from a pinhead like you,
that's a complement.

1213
01:07:28,006 --> 01:07:31,551
How about I come on down there to
that station of yours right now...

1214
01:07:31,634 --> 01:07:34,471
and bust your little
faggot face right in?

1215
01:07:34,554 --> 01:07:36,931
Who's gonna help, your brother? You
don't say nothin' about my brother.

1216
01:07:36,973 --> 01:07:39,517
Your brother hangs around Harry
Heinz Blvd., doesn't he? He's a pimp.

1217
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:41,644
And your wife, she's a
hooker, isn't she? My wife?

1218
01:07:41,728 --> 01:07:44,481
What do you beat her with,
a baseball bat?

1219
01:07:44,564 --> 01:07:46,483
Hmm?

1220
01:07:47,817 --> 01:07:51,446
Well, I know where
you live, partner.

1221
01:07:51,488 --> 01:07:54,574
Allright?
I know what you look like.

1222
01:07:54,657 --> 01:07:58,411
Mm-hmm.
Sweet dreams, sweetheart.

1223
01:08:00,497 --> 01:08:02,415
I can't wait.

1224
01:08:02,499 --> 01:08:05,794
Vincent, you're on Night Talk.
Say something interesting.

1225
01:08:05,835 --> 01:08:08,630
Yeah. Uh-
Yeah.

1226
01:08:08,713 --> 01:08:12,092
I've been listening to
you for five years. Uh-huh.

1227
01:08:12,175 --> 01:08:14,969
Yup, and the guys down here at
the store put you on every night.

1228
01:08:15,053 --> 01:08:17,430
Yup. And we sit around
and laugh at you...

1229
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:19,808
Yup. because you're
such a jerk-off and...

1230
01:08:19,891 --> 01:08:22,185
Yeah, all right.
Night Talk. Agnes, yeah.

1231
01:08:22,268 --> 01:08:25,313
Barry, can I ask you a question? Hit me.

1232
01:08:25,397 --> 01:08:29,567
I wouldn't hit you
for the world, sweetheart.

1233
01:08:29,651 --> 01:08:33,363
I Love Lucy. Now, why don't
they make more of them? What?

1234
01:08:33,446 --> 01:08:36,324
What do you want to talk
to Barry about?

1235
01:08:36,366 --> 01:08:38,827
You wanna rape somebody?

1236
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:42,414
Why don't you go home and take
a cold shower. That'd be better.

1237
01:08:42,497 --> 01:08:45,667
Those shows are ancient, Agnes. Lucille
Ball must be at least 105 years old.

1238
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:48,795
The rest of the cast is dead.
No. Now, she's not that old.

1239
01:08:48,878 --> 01:08:52,173
I saw her on the show the other
night, and she looked to be around 35.

1240
01:08:52,215 --> 01:08:55,343
And that Ricky Ricardo,
boy, can he play the bongos.

1241
01:08:55,385 --> 01:08:58,096
Nobody can be this stupid. Are you
serious, Agnes? You know what year this is?

1242
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:00,890
Yeah, John,
you're on Night Talk.

1243
01:09:00,974 --> 01:09:02,892
Remember me, Barry?

1244
01:09:02,976 --> 01:09:05,520
I called and said
I was in Turtle Creek.

1245
01:09:05,603 --> 01:09:07,981
Well, I...

1246
01:09:08,064 --> 01:09:10,817
I raped three women since then.

1247
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:15,947
Do you remember me? I'm
not sure. Refresh me, John.

1248
01:09:16,031 --> 01:09:19,659
I'm thinking about raping another
one, Barry. I saw her this morning.

1249
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:23,329
What are you doing to me, Stu? You're
killing me right here on the air.

1250
01:09:23,413 --> 01:09:26,916
- Oh, could we relax, please?
- These women I raped aren't turning me in.

1251
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,377
How come? Well, tell
me where you are, John,

1252
01:09:29,461 --> 01:09:31,796
and I'll make sure
you get some help.

1253
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,883
You have my word on that. I'm
just so tired of raping women. I...

1254
01:09:34,966 --> 01:09:38,136
I'm so tired
of raping women!

1255
01:09:38,219 --> 01:09:42,724
I
- I got rage for them! I got rage for them! John.

1256
01:09:42,807 --> 01:09:44,893
When was the last time
you raped a woman?

1257
01:09:46,519 --> 01:09:49,272
In Greenville
a couple weeks ago.

1258
01:09:49,356 --> 01:09:51,983
She was-
She was struttin' around...

1259
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:54,652
like she was something else.

1260
01:09:56,279 --> 01:09:58,740
Yeah, I-I understand, John.
I sympathize.

1261
01:09:58,782 --> 01:10:00,742
We all get angry.

1262
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:03,745
Where did the rape
actually occur?

1263
01:10:03,787 --> 01:10:06,956
It was in the backseat
of her car.

1264
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,376
She pulled into
the Jack in the Box parking lot.

1265
01:10:09,459 --> 01:10:12,754
I jumped in and said,
"Okay, I'm-"

1266
01:10:12,796 --> 01:10:16,675
It was nighttime, sometime.
I don't know.

1267
01:10:19,427 --> 01:10:22,472
How old are you, John?
I'm 40.

1268
01:10:22,555 --> 01:10:25,100
I was in the pen 12 years.
Are you taping this for me?

1269
01:10:25,183 --> 01:10:29,312
I didn't get no therapy. They didn't
do nothin' for me! Let me hook this up.

1270
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:33,233
They didn't- They didn't-
They didn't bother to help me!

1271
01:10:33,316 --> 01:10:38,113
Barry, I'm gonna rape somebody.
I'm gonna do it. But why?

1272
01:10:38,196 --> 01:10:41,116
I gotta!
It's an irresistible compulsion.

1273
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:44,285
It's like- It's like
tryin' to quit smoking.

1274
01:10:44,369 --> 01:10:47,205
Barry, I can't help myself.

1275
01:10:47,288 --> 01:10:49,290
I can't...

1276
01:10:49,374 --> 01:10:52,419
Yeah, all right. You have
this irresistible compulsion.

1277
01:10:52,502 --> 01:10:55,505
John, the last time we spoke,

1278
01:10:55,588 --> 01:10:57,966
you said that
jogging helped you.

1279
01:10:58,049 --> 01:11:00,719
Up and down Turtle Creek.

1280
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:03,555
Jogging up and down the
Turtle Creek. Turtle Creek!

1281
01:11:03,638 --> 01:11:08,268
I could name you every duck
in Turtle Creek!

1282
01:11:08,351 --> 01:11:12,647
John, have you decided
who you're gonna rape next?

1283
01:11:14,232 --> 01:11:16,901
I got her picked out,
staked out and ready.

1284
01:11:17,986 --> 01:11:20,363
I always wanted her.

1285
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:23,992
What is it about her
that you like?

1286
01:11:24,075 --> 01:11:29,831
What is it about a piece of strawberry
pie or a piece of pumpkin pie?

1287
01:11:29,873 --> 01:11:33,251
I mean, I don't know.
She could be black or white,

1288
01:11:33,335 --> 01:11:37,297
Hispano, Japanese,
pretty, fat, ugly.

1289
01:11:39,883 --> 01:11:42,218
I wanna rape them all!

1290
01:11:42,302 --> 01:11:46,264
All right, John, calm down. I
wanna help you. I'm your friend.

1291
01:11:48,099 --> 01:11:50,352
Are you my buddy, Barry?

1292
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:54,189
I'm your buddy, John.

1293
01:11:55,774 --> 01:11:58,360
I can't help myself.
I gotta go do it.

1294
01:11:58,401 --> 01:12:02,155
You can help yourself. You're not
gonna do it, John. No, I gotta do it.

1295
01:12:02,238 --> 01:12:04,366
No, you're not
gonna do it, John.

1296
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:06,951
Now, listen to me.
I'm gonna go do it.

1297
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:09,871
No, no, no. Think about
what you're saying, John.

1298
01:12:09,954 --> 01:12:14,584
John?

1299
01:12:14,668 --> 01:12:16,586
He's gone.

1300
01:12:27,597 --> 01:12:30,558
Another lost soul
goes into the Dallas night.

1301
01:12:31,935 --> 01:12:36,981
We-We have a police trace
on this.

1302
01:12:37,065 --> 01:12:39,317
If anybody knows
anything about this man...

1303
01:12:39,401 --> 01:12:43,530
or is in Turtle Creek or
sees someone in a phone booth,

1304
01:12:43,613 --> 01:12:45,615
please call us here
at KGAB.

1305
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:50,286
The number to call is,
is 555-TALK.

1306
01:12:54,332 --> 01:12:56,376
Uh, let's hear
from our sponsors...

1307
01:12:56,459 --> 01:12:58,920
Pasty Mate Roach
and Termite Cleaners.

1308
01:12:58,962 --> 01:13:01,464
Listen closely.

1309
01:13:01,548 --> 01:13:04,217
The sound
of cockroaches mating...

1310
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:08,096
enhanced 500 times.
They couldn't trace it.

1311
01:13:08,138 --> 01:13:10,348
Right, I should've kept him on
for another three hours.

1312
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:13,601
You know, I once had
a cup of Humphrey's coffee.

1313
01:13:13,685 --> 01:13:15,729
I was spitting blood
for three weeks.

1314
01:13:15,812 --> 01:13:18,398
You should try
the decaffeinated, Barry.

1315
01:13:18,732 --> 01:13:23,111
This is great.
Oh, wait. Don't tell me.

1316
01:13:23,153 --> 01:13:25,113
He seems
pretty harmless.

1317
01:13:25,155 --> 01:13:27,240
Come on, kid, sit down.
This is your chair.

1318
01:13:27,323 --> 01:13:29,284
This is your microphone.
Speak directly into it.

1319
01:13:29,325 --> 01:13:31,286
Keep your mouth about
six inches away from it.

1320
01:13:31,327 --> 01:13:35,707
These are your headphones so you can
hear the show. These are the ground rules.

1321
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:37,709
What?
The ground rules.

1322
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:40,628
No last names, no brand names,
no phone numbers over the air.

1323
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:44,632
Other than that, act and speak
normally. This is Mr. Barry Champlaign.

1324
01:13:44,674 --> 01:13:48,136
You're Barry.

1325
01:13:48,178 --> 01:13:50,597
You got him.
All right.

1326
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,807
What's wrong with him?
He's star struck.

1327
01:13:52,849 --> 01:13:55,185
Hey, kid, say something. I need
a level. Check, check. Check one.

1328
01:13:55,268 --> 01:13:57,479
Here we go on five,

1329
01:13:57,562 --> 01:14:01,399
four, three, two, one.
Stu.

1330
01:14:01,483 --> 01:14:05,653
Strap in, bitch.
Here we go.

1331
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:08,907
We're back. I'm Barry Champlaign.
You're listening to Night Talk.

1332
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:11,451
We have a very special guest
with us tonight.

1333
01:14:11,534 --> 01:14:13,495
Kent. Say hello
to everybody, Kent.

1334
01:14:13,536 --> 01:14:15,622
All right.

1335
01:14:15,705 --> 01:14:18,166
My sentiments exactly.

1336
01:14:18,249 --> 01:14:22,253
We've brought Kent on board to get an
inside look at the future of America.

1337
01:14:22,337 --> 01:14:24,589
Kent is the classic
American youth...

1338
01:14:24,673 --> 01:14:29,010
energetic and resourceful,
spoiled, perverse and disturbed.

1339
01:14:29,052 --> 01:14:31,846
Would you say that's an accurate
description, Kent? Yep, sure.

1340
01:14:31,888 --> 01:14:35,934
What do you call that haircut?
I don't know. Rock and roll!

1341
01:14:36,017 --> 01:14:38,687
Are you high right now,
Kent?

1342
01:14:39,729 --> 01:14:41,940
Am I high?
Are you on drugs,

1343
01:14:42,023 --> 01:14:44,526
or is this your naturally
moronic self?

1344
01:14:48,321 --> 01:14:50,782
Watch the drool. You're
getting it all over the console.

1345
01:14:55,912 --> 01:14:57,831
I can't believe
I'm here, man.

1346
01:14:59,582 --> 01:15:02,794
Hey. Wow. Does this thing really work?

1347
01:15:02,877 --> 01:15:05,547
You're sitting in
a radio station, Kent.

1348
01:15:05,588 --> 01:15:07,549
You're sitting in front
of a live mike.

1349
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:09,551
When you speak, thousands
of people hear your voice.

1350
01:15:09,592 --> 01:15:12,220
It penetrates their minds.

1351
01:15:17,392 --> 01:15:19,310
Okay, okay.
No, listen.

1352
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:23,231
I wanna send that one out to Diamond
Dave and Billy the bass player...

1353
01:15:23,314 --> 01:15:26,818
and all the babes
at the Valley View Mall.

1354
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,866
We're discussing
America here tonight, Kent.

1355
01:15:32,949 --> 01:15:34,868
Do you have any thoughts
on that subject?

1356
01:15:36,036 --> 01:15:38,079
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry.

1357
01:15:38,163 --> 01:15:40,874
I broke your train of thought. Please,
keep going. This is exhilarating.

1358
01:15:40,957 --> 01:15:43,043
No, I know.

1359
01:15:43,126 --> 01:15:45,503
It's not like I'm not political
or nothin'. You know, I mean...

1360
01:15:45,587 --> 01:15:49,007
I like Bruce.
He's political.

1361
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:52,010
Bruce Springsteen, yes.
A very deep, political thinker.

1362
01:15:52,093 --> 01:15:54,512
He's a communist, isn't he?

1363
01:15:54,596 --> 01:15:56,514
No, he's from New Jersey.

1364
01:15:56,598 --> 01:16:00,226
His ex is pretty nice.
Mm-hmm. Whose ex?

1365
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:02,896
Bruce's. Bruce Springsteen's
wife. Yes, what about her?

1366
01:16:02,979 --> 01:16:05,106
Julienne.
Hi, Julienne.

1367
01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:08,735
She was a model.
You know that, Bar?

1368
01:16:08,818 --> 01:16:11,112
All those guys
got models, Bar.

1369
01:16:11,154 --> 01:16:15,116
I mean, Mick and Jerry,
Keith and Patty,

1370
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,744
Prince and...

1371
01:16:17,827 --> 01:16:21,456
Prince.

1372
01:16:21,539 --> 01:16:23,458
You know, Bar,
Bingo.

1373
01:16:23,541 --> 01:16:25,460
models only hang around with
guys they think are coolest.

1374
01:16:25,543 --> 01:16:29,589
Look at you, man. You're a
big guy, famous star and all.

1375
01:16:29,673 --> 01:16:32,842
I mean, you got that fine babe
right over there...

1376
01:16:32,926 --> 01:16:35,095
who works for you, man.

1377
01:16:38,181 --> 01:16:41,643
So hey, if you got some
cash and you're cool,

1378
01:16:41,726 --> 01:16:44,062
you get to have a model.

1379
01:16:44,145 --> 01:16:46,815
So you wouldn't call yourself a
women's libber then, Kent, huh?

1380
01:16:46,856 --> 01:16:50,068
Yeah, I would, Bar. I mean,
everybody being liberated, you know.

1381
01:16:50,151 --> 01:16:53,113
Women, South Africans, all
those kind of people, you know.

1382
01:16:53,196 --> 01:16:55,448
I saw a show
about all that stuff...

1383
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:58,743
about how revolution's
a pretty important thing.

1384
01:16:58,827 --> 01:17:03,206
We're gonna have a lot more
revolutions where people get together,

1385
01:17:03,289 --> 01:17:06,167
solidarity and that
and...

1386
01:17:06,209 --> 01:17:08,294
You know,
like that song by Megadeath.

1387
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:10,338
# Peace sells
but who's buying #

1388
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:13,675
# Peace sells but who's
buying # Ah, come on!

1389
01:17:16,886 --> 01:17:18,888
Hey, plus-
Oh, I saw this other show...

1390
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:21,349
about how in the future they're
gonna have these two-way TV sets.

1391
01:17:21,391 --> 01:17:23,643
People will be able to see
each other and everything.

1392
01:17:23,685 --> 01:17:27,355
And then there's, like, no way they're
gonna be able to stop the revolution.

1393
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:31,484
Who won't be able
to stop it, Kent?

1394
01:17:31,568 --> 01:17:36,156
Big Brother, the government,
corporations.

1395
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:39,159
They're a bunch of fascists. They
wanna control everybody's mind.

1396
01:17:39,242 --> 01:17:42,162
But, hey, freedom's
an important thing,

1397
01:17:42,245 --> 01:17:44,581
just like you
always say, Bar.

1398
01:17:46,082 --> 01:17:48,001
You say
the best things, Bar.

1399
01:17:48,084 --> 01:17:50,045
I listen to you
all the time.

1400
01:17:50,128 --> 01:17:52,088
You're great.
Kent, you're an idiot.

1401
01:17:52,172 --> 01:17:54,341
I sincerely hope you do not
represent the future of this country,

1402
01:17:54,424 --> 01:17:56,343
because if you do
we are in sad shape.

1403
01:18:11,441 --> 01:18:14,402
Bar, man,
you're so funny, man.

1404
01:18:14,486 --> 01:18:18,531
That's why I love to listen to your show.
That's why all the kids listen to you, man.

1405
01:18:18,573 --> 01:18:20,533
Plus, these goons
push you around, you know.

1406
01:18:20,575 --> 01:18:22,535
All the kids
listen to you, Bar.

1407
01:18:22,577 --> 01:18:25,080
You are the best thing
on the radio!

1408
01:18:25,163 --> 01:18:28,708
Kent, we discuss a lot of
serious subjects on this show...

1409
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:32,379
sad things, frightening
things, tragic things.

1410
01:18:33,838 --> 01:18:36,132
Doesn't any of that
bother you?

1411
01:18:36,216 --> 01:18:38,927
Nope.

1412
01:18:38,968 --> 01:18:41,221
Why not?

1413
01:18:42,681 --> 01:18:45,392
It's just a show. It's one
big rock video, huh, Kent?

1414
01:18:45,475 --> 01:18:47,769
Yeah!

1415
01:18:51,856 --> 01:18:55,110
No.
Come on, Bar.

1416
01:18:57,821 --> 01:19:00,240
It's your show.

1417
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:06,746
Yeah, that it is, that it is.
It's my show.

1418
01:19:06,788 --> 01:19:09,290
Let's go back to the callers
on my show.

1419
01:19:09,374 --> 01:19:11,918
Uh, Julia,
you're on Night Talk.

1420
01:19:12,002 --> 01:19:13,962
Barry, hello.
Now, you know, darlin',

1421
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:15,964
I think these people who've
been callin' you tonight...

1422
01:19:16,006 --> 01:19:17,966
are a bunch of
I don't know what's.

1423
01:19:18,008 --> 01:19:22,554
It's crazy. And that crazy kid you
got on there, now, that's terrible.

1424
01:19:22,637 --> 01:19:27,100
I've been listenin' to your show
for five years straight, Barry,

1425
01:19:27,183 --> 01:19:29,269
and I love you and your show.

1426
01:19:29,352 --> 01:19:32,647
I think it's terrific that more
folks are gonna be listenin'.

1427
01:19:32,731 --> 01:19:36,109
I just hope you have time for
your longtime friends there, Bar.

1428
01:19:36,192 --> 01:19:38,403
I always have time
for my friends, Julia.

1429
01:19:38,486 --> 01:19:40,447
Aw, you're terrific.

1430
01:19:40,530 --> 01:19:43,742
Your show's terrific.
I don't know what else to say.

1431
01:19:43,825 --> 01:19:46,745
Well, tell me something, Julia,
since you listen all the time.

1432
01:19:46,828 --> 01:19:48,747
What is it
you like about the show?

1433
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:51,708
Well, I don't know.

1434
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:54,085
A lot of things.

1435
01:19:54,169 --> 01:19:57,839
Well, what, for instance?
Well, I love you, Bar.

1436
01:19:57,881 --> 01:20:00,258
Uh-huh, that's a given. Okay,
what about me do you love?

1437
01:20:00,342 --> 01:20:03,386
Well, you're very funny.
Uh-huh.

1438
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:07,098
And I love to hear you talk about
all the things you have to say.

1439
01:20:08,308 --> 01:20:10,518
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Let's get back to the show.

1440
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,520
The show must serve
some kind of purpose for you.

1441
01:20:12,562 --> 01:20:15,315
Well, now, I wouldn't say that.
What would you say?

1442
01:20:15,398 --> 01:20:17,484
Well, I don't know. What
do you mean, you don't know?

1443
01:20:17,567 --> 01:20:19,486
You said that at least five times
already. What don't you know?

1444
01:20:19,569 --> 01:20:21,654
You've been listening to this show for five
years. You don't know why you listen to it?

1445
01:20:21,696 --> 01:20:23,656
Well, I just said-
I heard what you just said.

1446
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:26,534
You said you don't know why you listen
to this show. Why don't I tell you why.

1447
01:20:26,576 --> 01:20:28,953
You listen so that you can feel
superior to the other losers who call in!

1448
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:30,955
Barry!
Don't "Barry" me!

1449
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:34,000
You've got sawdust between your ears
instead of brains. Just listen to you!

1450
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:36,419
If I sounded as stupid as you, I'd
be too embarrassed to open my mouth!

1451
01:20:36,503 --> 01:20:39,214
I'm hanging up!
Good, and don't call back.

1452
01:20:40,799 --> 01:20:42,717
Nothing more boring
than people who love you.

1453
01:20:43,176 --> 01:20:44,719
Yeah, you're on Night Talk.

1454
01:20:44,803 --> 01:20:47,514
I just have one thing
to ask you, Barry.

1455
01:20:47,597 --> 01:20:49,516
Hit me.

1456
01:20:49,599 --> 01:20:53,228
Are you as ugly-looking
as you sound? Uglier.

1457
01:20:53,269 --> 01:20:56,773
Yeah, I thought
you'd say something like that.

1458
01:20:56,856 --> 01:21:00,443
But as usual,
you avoid the question.

1459
01:21:01,986 --> 01:21:05,490
What's the question?
I think you know the question.

1460
01:21:07,492 --> 01:21:11,454
Is an animal a vegetable or a
mineral? The question is obvious.

1461
01:21:11,538 --> 01:21:14,082
Why does an intelligent fellow
like yourself...

1462
01:21:14,165 --> 01:21:19,337
spend so much energy
hurting other people?

1463
01:21:19,421 --> 01:21:21,840
Hmm?
Do you not love yourself?

1464
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:27,929
I think you're very
lonely, Barry.

1465
01:21:27,971 --> 01:21:32,100
I'm sorry for you, because
you don't know how to love.

1466
01:21:35,311 --> 01:21:37,856
Night Talk. Ralph.

1467
01:21:39,107 --> 01:21:41,443
They always say that,
don't they?

1468
01:21:43,319 --> 01:21:46,865
"Why are you so angry"?

1469
01:21:46,948 --> 01:21:49,409
Well, they don't understand
me and you, Barry.

1470
01:21:49,492 --> 01:21:52,579
We're the kind of people,
we feel too much.

1471
01:21:52,662 --> 01:21:54,581
Are we, Ralph?

1472
01:21:56,666 --> 01:21:59,461
Yeah, my name is Cheryl Ann.
I'll hold.

1473
01:22:01,046 --> 01:22:04,382
Who knows? I mean,
take, for instance, cancer.

1474
01:22:04,466 --> 01:22:07,135
What is cancer?
What are you doing, Ellen?

1475
01:22:08,845 --> 01:22:12,307
He's all alone out there.
So what?

1476
01:22:16,311 --> 01:22:18,229
He's going down in flames,
Dan.

1477
01:22:20,148 --> 01:22:22,400
It's Barry's show,
Ellen.

1478
01:22:22,484 --> 01:22:25,362
Let Barry
do Barry's show.

1479
01:22:25,445 --> 01:22:28,448
Well, what are they gonna do
with my TV set?

1480
01:22:28,531 --> 01:22:30,784
We watch it. That's what
people do with TV sets.

1481
01:22:30,825 --> 01:22:35,163
What do they see? They see people
killing people, babies starving, floods.

1482
01:22:35,205 --> 01:22:37,165
And for what?
For nothing!

1483
01:22:37,207 --> 01:22:40,001
For beer commercials
and Tampax ads,

1484
01:22:40,043 --> 01:22:42,504
MTV, a yacht, the ocean,

1485
01:22:42,545 --> 01:22:44,506
a diamond earring,
a racehorse.

1486
01:22:44,547 --> 01:22:47,467
Well, I guess so.

1487
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:51,179
I guess so. All I know is
what I read in the papers.

1488
01:22:51,262 --> 01:22:56,309
And that's a lot of talk. Barry,
it's talk. Talk, talk, talk.

1489
01:22:56,351 --> 01:22:58,478
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk,
talk, talk! Ralph, Ralph, Ralph!

1490
01:22:58,561 --> 01:23:01,231
Tell me something.
I'm curious.

1491
01:23:01,314 --> 01:23:03,692
How do you dial a phone
with a straightjacket on?

1492
01:23:03,733 --> 01:23:06,194
Barry.

1493
01:23:06,236 --> 01:23:08,822
I don't know much about God
and I never was very religious,

1494
01:23:08,863 --> 01:23:13,493
but you can't help feeling
like something is wrong,

1495
01:23:13,576 --> 01:23:17,372
like nobody's
driving the train,

1496
01:23:18,456 --> 01:23:21,167
the system,

1497
01:23:21,209 --> 01:23:23,545
'cause too many people
are gettin' sick.

1498
01:23:25,046 --> 01:23:28,758
And the traffic,
it's just jamming up.

1499
01:23:29,884 --> 01:23:34,139
And even the weather,
not so good lately.

1500
01:23:34,222 --> 01:23:38,685
Barry, I just don't
- I don't get it, Barry. I just don't get it.

1501
01:23:38,768 --> 01:23:41,980
You don't get it, wimp? Here's
what you get! You get $1.59,

1502
01:23:42,063 --> 01:23:44,816
That's it. go down to the drugstore,
buy a pack of razor blades,

1503
01:23:44,899 --> 01:23:48,069
and slash your
fuckin' wrists, pinhead!

1504
01:23:48,153 --> 01:23:52,157
That's it, kid.
Come on.

1505
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:53,825
What?
Get him out of here, now!

1506
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,332
Hey, Barry!

1507
01:24:05,295 --> 01:24:07,589
Get the fuck off me,
you fuckin' son of a bitch!

1508
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:09,716
Thank you, Dallas!
Good night!

1509
01:24:09,799 --> 01:24:11,718
You allright, Barry?
Standby.

1510
01:24:15,722 --> 01:24:17,640
I'm confused, Barry.

1511
01:24:21,144 --> 01:24:23,104
What did you say
your name was?

1512
01:24:23,146 --> 01:24:25,190
Cheryl Ann.

1513
01:24:25,273 --> 01:24:28,318
It's about my ex-husband.

1514
01:24:28,401 --> 01:24:32,864
He's back in town and, well,
I haven't seen him for a while.

1515
01:24:35,492 --> 01:24:38,286
What are you confused about,
Cheryl Ann?

1516
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:40,288
Well, let me first say...

1517
01:24:40,372 --> 01:24:43,583
that I left my ex-husband
for very good reasons.

1518
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:46,753
Did it- Let's not
get into them, okay?

1519
01:24:46,836 --> 01:24:50,131
And he's anything but perfect.

1520
01:24:50,173 --> 01:24:54,803
He smokes, he drinks,
he loves to argue.

1521
01:24:54,886 --> 01:24:57,806
Sounds like my kind of guy.
Yeah.

1522
01:25:00,684 --> 01:25:02,644
He is a little bit like you.

1523
01:25:02,686 --> 01:25:07,107
Yeah, well, we gotta move
it along here, Cheryl Ann.

1524
01:25:07,148 --> 01:25:09,109
You wanna get to the point?

1525
01:25:10,318 --> 01:25:13,780
I have, um,
feelings for him.

1526
01:25:15,657 --> 01:25:17,575
What kind of feelings?

1527
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,704
Nice feelings.

1528
01:25:20,787 --> 01:25:22,914
Um...

1529
01:25:22,997 --> 01:25:24,958
This is hard to say.

1530
01:25:26,042 --> 01:25:28,378
Sexual feelings?

1531
01:25:28,461 --> 01:25:32,007
It's not just that.
I mean, yes, of course, but...

1532
01:25:34,134 --> 01:25:36,845
I still love him.

1533
01:25:36,928 --> 01:25:39,681
It's not the same
with my husband.

1534
01:25:39,723 --> 01:25:41,683
We had something,

1535
01:25:41,725 --> 01:25:44,269
and... I want him.

1536
01:25:46,396 --> 01:25:48,481
I want him inside of me.

1537
01:25:50,942 --> 01:25:52,986
I want to take care of him.

1538
01:25:55,363 --> 01:25:57,824
I want to be with him.

1539
01:26:00,452 --> 01:26:02,370
You wanna be close to him.

1540
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:05,540
Yes.

1541
01:26:07,042 --> 01:26:09,002
You wanna hold him.

1542
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:12,839
Oh, yes.

1543
01:26:14,341 --> 01:26:16,843
You wanna relive
the feelings you two had.

1544
01:26:18,219 --> 01:26:20,138
Yes, Barry.

1545
01:26:22,557 --> 01:26:24,517
You don't love
your husband?

1546
01:26:25,977 --> 01:26:27,896
No. Well, I...

1547
01:26:27,979 --> 01:26:30,315
You tell him
that you love him.

1548
01:26:30,398 --> 01:26:32,567
You lie to him and
you tell him that you love him.

1549
01:26:32,609 --> 01:26:35,695
I do love him.

1550
01:26:35,779 --> 01:26:38,156
I love him as a friend.

1551
01:26:39,657 --> 01:26:41,785
Friend.

1552
01:26:41,868 --> 01:26:44,079
Everyone's your friend.

1553
01:26:45,413 --> 01:26:47,415
Not like my ex-husband.

1554
01:26:48,792 --> 01:26:51,336
There's a passion there
for his soul and...

1555
01:26:55,131 --> 01:26:59,719
I- I thought I wanted a
simple life, but I-I was wrong.

1556
01:27:01,346 --> 01:27:03,556
I want my old life back.

1557
01:27:05,725 --> 01:27:07,644
Sounds like
you made a mistake.

1558
01:27:08,812 --> 01:27:10,814
Should've stuck with
the first guy.

1559
01:27:12,023 --> 01:27:15,485
Yeah, well, what was I
supposed to do?

1560
01:27:21,783 --> 01:27:23,910
I love you, Barry.

1561
01:27:29,791 --> 01:27:34,087
Ever hear the story of the little
dog who had a bone in his mouth?

1562
01:27:34,129 --> 01:27:37,924
And he's trotting over this
bridge and he looks over...

1563
01:27:38,008 --> 01:27:40,301
and sees his reflection
in the water.

1564
01:27:40,343 --> 01:27:42,345
Thinks it's another dog.

1565
01:27:42,429 --> 01:27:45,265
That dog has a bone
in his mouth too.

1566
01:27:45,306 --> 01:27:49,144
The dog wants both bones, so he
barks at the little dog in the water,

1567
01:27:49,185 --> 01:27:51,396
trying to scare him.

1568
01:27:51,479 --> 01:27:53,815
Bone drops out of his mouth.

1569
01:27:53,857 --> 01:27:56,484
Loses both bones.

1570
01:27:59,571 --> 01:28:02,490
What has that got to do
with what I just said?

1571
01:28:02,532 --> 01:28:05,201
Babe, I don't know
what to tell you.

1572
01:28:05,285 --> 01:28:07,245
You blew it!

1573
01:28:07,328 --> 01:28:09,873
You know, women like you
are never happy.

1574
01:28:09,956 --> 01:28:13,335
What do you want me to say? Leave
your husband? Go back to your ex?

1575
01:28:13,418 --> 01:28:15,337
Your ex doesn't want you.

1576
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:19,466
He's got women all over the
place. He doesn't need you.

1577
01:28:19,507 --> 01:28:24,137
He's not some suburban zombie like
your husband. He's out there having fun.

1578
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:27,974
Did you ever think of that? Maybe
your ex-husband doesn't want you?

1579
01:28:28,016 --> 01:28:31,519
Hmm? He came on to me.
He said he wanted me.

1580
01:28:31,603 --> 01:28:34,189
You're Iying again.
He said he still loved me.

1581
01:28:34,272 --> 01:28:38,026
You're Iying! You're a sexually
unsatisfied woman living in a dream world!

1582
01:28:38,068 --> 01:28:41,363
I feel sorry for you!

1583
01:28:41,446 --> 01:28:43,365
So why don't you stick
with Mr. America there,

1584
01:28:43,448 --> 01:28:47,160
go out and buy yourself a heavy-duty
vibrator, and knock yourself out.

1585
01:28:48,661 --> 01:28:51,539
We reap what we sow.

1586
01:28:51,581 --> 01:28:54,000
Follow me, Cheryl Ann?

1587
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:12,143
Probably frigid.
And we have Theresa on the line.

1588
01:29:13,395 --> 01:29:15,730
The day will come
for you, Barry.

1589
01:29:15,772 --> 01:29:20,318
And there will be
a reckoning,

1590
01:29:20,402 --> 01:29:24,197
an adding up
and a totaling.

1591
01:29:25,323 --> 01:29:29,536
Those who turned away
will be turned upon.

1592
01:29:29,577 --> 01:29:34,249
And I don't care
what your story is, Barry.

1593
01:29:34,332 --> 01:29:39,879
You are responsible, and there
will be no confusion at your trial.

1594
01:29:41,589 --> 01:29:46,219
It will be short,
and necks will crack.

1595
01:29:47,929 --> 01:29:51,725
The whips will strip your back
bare to the bone,

1596
01:29:51,766 --> 01:29:54,602
and your children
will cry for you...

1597
01:29:54,644 --> 01:29:58,273
as they are slaughtered
before your eyes.

1598
01:30:00,942 --> 01:30:03,069
You...

1599
01:30:03,153 --> 01:30:08,074
The Jews will hang high
over the streets.

1600
01:30:10,243 --> 01:30:12,746
You will be buried in piles.

1601
01:30:12,787 --> 01:30:14,789
You dig your own holes.

1602
01:30:17,417 --> 01:30:21,588
I am here merely to tell you
that the day will come.

1603
01:30:23,506 --> 01:30:25,467
It will.

1604
01:30:29,304 --> 01:30:32,015
Believe it or not,
you make perfect sense to me.

1605
01:30:35,143 --> 01:30:37,062
I should hang.

1606
01:30:38,146 --> 01:30:40,065
I'm a hypocrite.

1607
01:30:41,399 --> 01:30:43,818
I ask for sincerity,
and I lie.

1608
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:47,739
I denounce the system
as I embrace it.

1609
01:30:49,783 --> 01:30:54,412
I want money and power
and prestige.

1610
01:30:54,496 --> 01:30:56,873
I want ratings and success.

1611
01:30:56,956 --> 01:31:02,337
I don't give a damn about you
or the world. That's the truth.

1612
01:31:02,379 --> 01:31:08,009
For this, I could say I'm
sorry, but I won't. Why should I?

1613
01:31:08,677 --> 01:31:11,846
I mean, who the hell are
you anyways, you audience?

1614
01:31:13,056 --> 01:31:15,016
You're on me every night
like a pack of wolves,

1615
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:19,562
'cause you can't stand facing
what you are and what you've made.

1616
01:31:19,646 --> 01:31:22,524
Yes, the world
is a terrible place.

1617
01:31:22,607 --> 01:31:25,819
Yes, cancer and garbage
disposals will get you.

1618
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:27,821
Yes, a war is coming.

1619
01:31:27,862 --> 01:31:30,031
Yes, the world is shot to hell,
and you're all goners.

1620
01:31:30,115 --> 01:31:33,201
Everything's screwed up, and
you like it that way, don't you?

1621
01:31:34,703 --> 01:31:37,664
You're fascinated
by the gory details.

1622
01:31:39,332 --> 01:31:42,002
You're mesmerized
by your own fear.

1623
01:31:43,753 --> 01:31:48,466
You revel in floods,
car accidents.

1624
01:31:49,551 --> 01:31:51,469
Unstoppable diseases.

1625
01:31:55,348 --> 01:31:57,517
You're happiest
when others are in pain.

1626
01:31:59,227 --> 01:32:02,272
That's where I come in,
isn't it?

1627
01:32:02,355 --> 01:32:05,108
I'm here to lead you by the
hands through the dark forest...

1628
01:32:05,191 --> 01:32:09,112
of your own hatred
and anger and humiliation.

1629
01:32:10,196 --> 01:32:12,115
I'm providing a public service.

1630
01:32:13,283 --> 01:32:15,952
You're so scared.

1631
01:32:16,036 --> 01:32:17,954
You're like a little child
under the covers.

1632
01:32:18,038 --> 01:32:21,916
You're afraid of the bogeyman,
but you can't live without him.

1633
01:32:21,958 --> 01:32:25,420
Your fear, your own lives,
have become your entertainment.

1634
01:32:28,465 --> 01:32:31,301
Next month, millions of people are
gonna be listening to this show,

1635
01:32:31,384 --> 01:32:33,803
and you'll have
nothing to talk about!

1636
01:32:35,263 --> 01:32:37,474
Marvelous technology
is at our disposal.

1637
01:32:37,557 --> 01:32:41,311
Instead of reaching up to new heights,
we're gonna see how far down we can go.

1638
01:32:41,394 --> 01:32:45,899
How deep into the muck
we can immerse ourselves.

1639
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:48,401
What do you wanna
talk about, hmm?

1640
01:32:49,444 --> 01:32:51,905
Baseball scores?

1641
01:32:51,946 --> 01:32:53,907
Your pet?

1642
01:32:54,991 --> 01:32:56,951
Orgasms?

1643
01:32:59,996 --> 01:33:02,665
You're pathetic.

1644
01:33:02,749 --> 01:33:05,669
I despise each
and every one of you.

1645
01:33:06,795 --> 01:33:09,214
You got nothing,

1646
01:33:09,297 --> 01:33:11,216
absolutely nothing.

1647
01:33:12,801 --> 01:33:16,721
No brains, no power, no future.

1648
01:33:18,348 --> 01:33:20,308
No hope.

1649
01:33:21,643 --> 01:33:23,603
No God.

1650
01:33:25,021 --> 01:33:27,482
The only thing
you believe in is me.

1651
01:33:29,442 --> 01:33:31,361
What are you
if you don't have me?

1652
01:33:33,446 --> 01:33:35,949
I'm not afraid, see?

1653
01:33:36,032 --> 01:33:39,869
I come in every night, make my case,
make my point, say what I believe in!

1654
01:33:39,953 --> 01:33:43,331
I tell you what you are.
I have to. I have no choice.

1655
01:33:44,374 --> 01:33:46,334
You frighten me.

1656
01:33:48,294 --> 01:33:51,589
I come here every night, tear into
you, I abuse you, I insult you,

1657
01:33:51,673 --> 01:33:53,591
and you just keep
coming back for more.

1658
01:33:53,675 --> 01:33:56,011
What's wrong with you?
Why do you keep calling?

1659
01:33:56,094 --> 01:33:58,930
I don't wanna hear it anymore.
Stop talking!

1660
01:33:59,014 --> 01:34:00,932
Go away!

1661
01:34:03,727 --> 01:34:06,938
You're a bunch of yellow-bellied,
spineless, bigoted,

1662
01:34:07,022 --> 01:34:09,482
quivering, drunken,
insomniatic,

1663
01:34:09,524 --> 01:34:13,445
paranoid, disgusting, perverted,
voyeuristic, little obscene phone callers.

1664
01:34:13,528 --> 01:34:16,072
That's what you are.

1665
01:34:16,156 --> 01:34:18,783
Well, to hell with you.

1666
01:34:18,867 --> 01:34:22,620
I don't need your fear and your
stupidity. You don't get it.

1667
01:34:22,704 --> 01:34:24,622
It's wasted on you.

1668
01:34:27,417 --> 01:34:29,878
Burros before swine.

1669
01:34:39,888 --> 01:34:43,808
If one person out there
had any idea...

1670
01:34:43,892 --> 01:34:46,519
of what I'm talking about...

1671
01:34:51,733 --> 01:34:53,693
Fred, you're on Night Talk.

1672
01:34:53,735 --> 01:34:56,404
Yes. You see, Barry,

1673
01:34:56,488 --> 01:34:59,866
I know it's depressing that so many
people don't understand you're just joking.

1674
01:34:59,908 --> 01:35:01,868
Jackie, you're on Night Talk.

1675
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:05,622
Hello. I've been listening for years,
and I find you a warm and intelligent...

1676
01:35:05,705 --> 01:35:07,624
Arnold.

1677
01:35:07,707 --> 01:35:10,627
What you were saying before about
loneliness, I'm an electrical engineer...

1678
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:14,714
Lucy. My mother is from Waco and wants
to know if you went to high school...

1679
01:35:14,756 --> 01:35:19,094
Larry. Why do people insist
on calling homosexuals normal?

1680
01:35:19,135 --> 01:35:22,514
Ralph!
I'm in my house.

1681
01:35:22,597 --> 01:35:24,724
I'm at home,

1682
01:35:24,766 --> 01:35:28,061
which is where
you should be, Barry.

1683
01:35:28,103 --> 01:35:32,273
Hey, I'm not far away.
You could come over if you want.

1684
01:35:32,315 --> 01:35:34,901
We're the same kind of people.

1685
01:35:34,943 --> 01:35:38,405
I have beer, soup.

1686
01:35:41,533 --> 01:35:43,451
I'm here.

1687
01:35:44,202 --> 01:35:46,121
Come over later.

1688
01:35:47,956 --> 01:35:51,292
I'll wait.

1689
01:35:56,923 --> 01:35:59,426
Barry, there's 60 seconds
left in the show.

1690
01:36:13,982 --> 01:36:16,359
This is dead air, Barry.

1691
01:36:16,443 --> 01:36:18,361
Dead air.

1692
01:36:51,853 --> 01:36:54,314
I guess we're stuck
with each other.

1693
01:36:56,066 --> 01:36:58,193
This is Barry Champlaign.

1694
01:37:24,552 --> 01:37:26,971
Barry.

1695
01:37:33,269 --> 01:37:37,649
That was great.
I feel very good about this.

1696
01:37:37,732 --> 01:37:41,611
I'm gonna talk to the lawyers, and we'll
get started on this deal right away.

1697
01:37:41,695 --> 01:37:44,781
We're gonna be seeing
a lot more of each other.

1698
01:37:44,864 --> 01:37:46,783
I'll be in touch.

1699
01:37:49,577 --> 01:37:51,538
Barry.

1700
01:37:56,584 --> 01:37:59,087
That was great.

1701
01:38:01,006 --> 01:38:03,425
You pulled it off, champ.
Congratulations.

1702
01:38:04,509 --> 01:38:07,178
I'll see you tomorrow.

1703
01:38:07,262 --> 01:38:09,180
Dan.

1704
01:38:11,683 --> 01:38:14,102
What if I don't come in
tomorrow night?

1705
01:38:15,186 --> 01:38:17,105
You'll come in tomorrow,
Barry.

1706
01:38:18,314 --> 01:38:20,275
You always do.

1707
01:38:29,325 --> 01:38:32,287
She left, huh?
Yep. I don't blame her.

1708
01:38:33,913 --> 01:38:38,918
Her best line was, "Barry
Champlaign's a nice place to visit,

1709
01:38:39,002 --> 01:38:41,463
but I wouldn't want
to live there."

1710
01:38:43,548 --> 01:38:45,925
The show's a washout, Stu.

1711
01:38:45,967 --> 01:38:49,429
Give me a break, will you?
We're going national, man.

1712
01:38:49,512 --> 01:38:53,099
Besides, it's not that
important. It's just one show.

1713
01:38:54,726 --> 01:38:58,271
If it's not that important, why
am I doing it? I don't know, Barry.

1714
01:38:58,313 --> 01:39:00,357
You don't like the heights,
don't climb the mountains.

1715
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:04,235
You know what I mean? It's
like that kid just said:

1716
01:39:04,319 --> 01:39:07,155
"Man, this is your show."

1717
01:39:07,197 --> 01:39:09,157
Where you headed?

1718
01:39:10,533 --> 01:39:15,789
I don't know. Go to
Ellen's hotel, try to talk.

1719
01:39:15,830 --> 01:39:18,375
That's good.
Tomorrow, Barry.

1720
01:39:18,458 --> 01:39:20,377
Before I take
the first caller this evening,

1721
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:23,046
Tomorrow, Stu. I'd like to
comment on something I saw...

1722
01:39:23,129 --> 01:39:26,508
in the parking lot
on the way into the station.

1723
01:39:26,549 --> 01:39:30,345
There was a man standing there,
Walk you to your car?

1724
01:39:30,428 --> 01:39:32,347
obviously mentally disturbed.

1725
01:39:32,430 --> 01:39:35,183
It made me think about something
we don't often talk about.

1726
01:39:37,852 --> 01:39:40,438
Wanna grab a burger,
just talk?

1727
01:39:46,027 --> 01:39:48,446
I'm too old for you,
Laura.

1728
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:50,448
Ow.

1729
01:39:51,991 --> 01:39:56,621
I mean, you don't
know about Vietnam,

1730
01:39:56,705 --> 01:39:59,416
Easy Rider, Beatles.

1731
01:39:59,499 --> 01:40:01,584
Start over, Grandpa.

1732
01:40:03,503 --> 01:40:06,256
I can't.

1733
01:40:06,339 --> 01:40:08,717
I'm inside this thing.

1734
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,719
You're not.

1735
01:40:13,263 --> 01:40:15,724
You know what
my greatest fear is?

1736
01:40:16,808 --> 01:40:18,727
Being boring.

1737
01:40:19,811 --> 01:40:23,023
You're not boring.

1738
01:40:23,064 --> 01:40:28,028
I'm afraid that the whole
audience is gonna get up and leave.

1739
01:40:33,825 --> 01:40:35,910
I get confused sometimes
about this love stuff.

1740
01:40:35,994 --> 01:40:41,416
I don't know what people mean
when they say that they're in love,

1741
01:40:41,499 --> 01:40:43,418
but...

1742
01:40:45,337 --> 01:40:49,257
but I do know that I don't think
you're the bad guy you think you are.

1743
01:40:53,261 --> 01:40:55,221
Yes, I am.

1744
01:40:56,264 --> 01:40:58,600
I'll take a rain check
on that burger.

1745
01:41:16,951 --> 01:41:20,872
Excuse me, Barry.
Barry. Mr. Champlaign.

1746
01:41:20,955 --> 01:41:24,125
I hate to bother you. Do you think
you could give me an autograph, please?

1747
01:41:24,167 --> 01:41:26,670
Some show tonight.
Sure.

1748
01:41:26,753 --> 01:41:29,631
What'd you say your name was?
You're dead, fucker.

1749
01:42:13,341 --> 01:42:15,260
You come on down
to these parts,

1750
01:42:15,343 --> 01:42:18,221
you start telling people their
business and insulting their race,

1751
01:42:18,304 --> 01:42:20,974
you end up like Champlaign,
I'll tell you that right now.

1752
01:42:21,016 --> 01:42:24,561
I listened to his show the
night that he was killed.

1753
01:42:24,644 --> 01:42:28,273
There was this drug-crazed
kid bothering him.

1754
01:42:28,356 --> 01:42:32,736
When people smoke that crack
stuff, they go berserk, you know?

1755
01:42:32,819 --> 01:42:34,738
I hope they catch
that kid.

1756
01:42:34,821 --> 01:42:38,158
But they ought to listen to
that show. He was on the air.

1757
01:42:38,199 --> 01:42:41,077
I didn't think he was gonna
get shot or anything,

1758
01:42:41,161 --> 01:42:43,288
but that show was strange.

1759
01:42:43,371 --> 01:42:47,459
I mean, I got to be on his show the
last day. That was his last show.

1760
01:42:47,542 --> 01:42:50,879
I feel kinda like my whole
life is different, you know?

1761
01:42:50,962 --> 01:42:53,715
Like I'm kinda blessed.

1762
01:42:53,798 --> 01:42:57,385
But like I told Barry,
you know, I mean, hey,

1763
01:42:57,469 --> 01:43:01,723
life is kinda just like
a big party thrown by God,

1764
01:43:01,765 --> 01:43:04,225
and I'm the new
toastmaster, Bar.

1765
01:43:18,656 --> 01:43:21,076
Like Barry always said,

1766
01:43:21,159 --> 01:43:24,579
if you didn't like him,
turn him off.

1767
01:43:26,623 --> 01:43:28,917
But they didn't have
to kill him.

1768
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:33,129
I think that young boy that had come
in on the show, I think he did it.

1769
01:43:33,213 --> 01:43:35,131
I'll tell you
how I feel about it.

1770
01:43:35,215 --> 01:43:37,133
I think if you steal something,
they oughta cut your hands off.

1771
01:43:37,217 --> 01:43:39,219
If you rape somebody, they ought
a cut your you-know-what off.

1772
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:42,180
I never called him.

1773
01:43:42,263 --> 01:43:44,391
And now I'm sorry.

1774
01:43:44,474 --> 01:43:46,434
He never even hung up on me.

1775
01:43:48,436 --> 01:43:51,314
I miss him. You know how when
you have a cast on your arm...

1776
01:43:51,398 --> 01:43:53,566
and they cut it off,
you miss having it?

1777
01:43:53,608 --> 01:43:57,529
He was like a cast
on my arm. I miss him.

1778
01:43:57,612 --> 01:44:00,407
He was like a hot-fudge sundae
with fresh pecans.

1779
01:44:00,448 --> 01:44:03,284
Now, I knew I shouldn't listen
to him 'cause he always got me...

1780
01:44:03,326 --> 01:44:06,830
so dog-dang riled up till I
was like to smash my radio.

1781
01:44:06,913 --> 01:44:11,167
He did a whole show once on which
way to roll your toilet paper.

1782
01:44:11,251 --> 01:44:15,505
Over or under?
People responded for hours.

1783
01:44:15,588 --> 01:44:17,799
Some got so angry,
they hung up.

1784
01:44:17,882 --> 01:44:21,678
I called almost every night.
I loved Barry.

1785
01:44:21,761 --> 01:44:24,472
Didn't care much for the fellow
who answered the phone, though.

1786
01:44:24,556 --> 01:44:27,392
You know, he always forgot
I was waiting on the line.

1787
01:44:27,475 --> 01:44:31,229
Didn't I read he was having some
kind of problem with his wife?

1788
01:44:31,312 --> 01:44:34,274
Yes, he was
insensitive and nasty,

1789
01:44:34,315 --> 01:44:37,277
but he was a strong, masculine
presence on the radio.

1790
01:44:37,318 --> 01:44:40,405
Why would anyone
do such a thing?

1791
01:44:40,488 --> 01:44:44,659
Oh, well, there's another
bright star in God's heaven.

1792
01:44:44,743 --> 01:44:48,830
My view is that you don't give
a group like the neo-Nazis...

1793
01:44:48,913 --> 01:44:50,832
access to the airways
like he did.

1794
01:44:50,915 --> 01:44:53,835
Basically, I couldn't stand
Barry Champlaign.

1795
01:44:53,918 --> 01:44:57,839
I was in love with his voice.
I was in love with his voice.

1796
01:44:57,881 --> 01:45:00,175
He was in love
with his own voice.

1797
01:45:00,216 --> 01:45:06,014
My first thought was that I couldn't
believe anyone could hate him that much.

1798
01:45:06,056 --> 01:45:11,394
Disagree or dislike, but
not hate him. Not kill him.

1799
01:45:13,563 --> 01:45:16,358
My second thought was...

1800
01:45:16,441 --> 01:45:20,070
that he always wondered
if there was a God.

1801
01:45:20,153 --> 01:45:23,573
Barry said he had to wait
until the evidence was in.

1802
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:28,078
Now you know, Barry.

1803
01:45:28,161 --> 01:45:29,871
Now you know.

1804
01:45:30,705 --> 01:45:35,168
Now, we know that whatever the law
says, it speaks to those under the law...

1805
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:39,631
so that every mouth
maybe stopped...

1806
01:45:39,714 --> 01:45:43,802
and the whole world
may be held accountable to God.

1807
01:45:43,885 --> 01:45:45,804
The world is crazy, crazy!

1808
01:45:45,887 --> 01:45:49,099
Barry was rude, but
he was a funny guy too.

1809
01:45:49,182 --> 01:45:51,643
He insulted my mother
when I called,

1810
01:45:51,726 --> 01:45:54,145
but this is why we have
freedom of speech.

1811
01:45:54,229 --> 01:45:57,315
I hope that when
they remember Barry,

1812
01:45:57,399 --> 01:46:00,360
they remember
what he said...

1813
01:46:00,443 --> 01:46:02,987
and not the style
in which he said it.

1814
01:46:03,071 --> 01:46:04,989
It was karmic.

1815
01:46:05,073 --> 01:46:07,075
You just can't put out
that much bad karma...

1816
01:46:07,158 --> 01:46:09,119
without it coming
back at you.

1817
01:46:09,202 --> 01:46:12,122
Barry and I worked together
for over seven years.

1818
01:46:12,205 --> 01:46:16,126
Whenever you threatened him over the air,
man, he'd stick it right back in your face.

1819
01:46:16,209 --> 01:46:18,128
It was like his dick
was flapping in the wing...

1820
01:46:18,211 --> 01:46:20,922
and he liked to see
if he could get an erection.

1821
01:46:21,006 --> 01:46:25,552
The guy had a little dick, but
he liked to flap it out there.

1822
01:46:25,635 --> 01:46:28,513
Then they cut if off.
Now he's dead.

1823
01:46:28,596 --> 01:46:31,266
I don't know if you
understand that analogy,

1824
01:46:31,349 --> 01:46:33,268
but it's the clearest one
I can make.
