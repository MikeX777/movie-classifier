Charlotte? Come and see Jen's baby.

5
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,960
Hello. Hi.

6
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,240
How are you?

7
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,480
I'm good.

8
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,000
We're having a little nap.

9
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,840
So, how are you finding it?

10
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,400
Great. She is a little joy,
honestly.

11
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,800
Do you want a hold?
Oh, no, I couldn't.

12
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,480
Yeah, go on. Come on.

13
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,320
There we go.

14
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,040
There.

15
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,120
There, that's it.

16
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,440
Yeah.

17
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,000
Aawww. She likes you.

18
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,480
Really? She's not normally this good
with strangers, honestly.

19
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,000
Oh, she can be
a right madam sometimes.

20
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,960
I bet you're looking forward
to getting back to work.

21
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,080
Yeah, yeah.

22
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,440
I'm back in June.

23
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,320
Erm...

24
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,800
But you know what, I think
I might just stay at home,

25
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,760
do the whole mum thing instead,
you know?

26
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,360
What about your career?

27
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,720
Of course. Yeah, I know,
but, erm...

28
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,280
Well, now Tom's been made partner,
I can kind of relax a bit.

29
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,320
Tom's been made a partner?

30
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,440
Has it... Has it not
been announced yet?

31
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,760
Oh, sorry.

32
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,360
Hmm.

33
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,720
Oh, bigmouth strikes again, eh?

34
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,160
OK.

35
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,840
Oh.

36
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,920
Oh, sweetie.

37
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,800
Come back to Mummy.

38
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Oh!

39
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,760
I'm so, so sorry, Charlotte.

40
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,520
Please, send me
the dry-cleaning bill.

41
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,760
It's fine.
Charlotte, do you have a minute?

42
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,080
Sure.

43
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,440
Bye, Charlotte, nice to see you.

44
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,280
You too.

45
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,120
Yes. Yeah, that's better.

46
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,760
Has she got any teeth yet?
Yeah, she's got two.

47
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,960
Come on, baby. Yes.
Show us your little teeth.

48
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, lovely little smile. Yeah.

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,880
She's a happy
little girl, isn't she?

50
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,320
This is shit!

51
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,680
Of course I can market
over Mina, I just did.

52
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,920
Well, then stop trying
to feed me such utter bullshit.

53
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,320
Well, what's the procedure?
We went through a procedure.

54
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,200
It's constructive dismissal,
that's what it is, Simon.

55
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,840
I was promised equity in the merger

56
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,280
and now you're trying
to get rid of me.

57
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,000
I've been here three years
longer than Tom.

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,920
Look, he wouldn't even be in
a position to sell the agency

59
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,680
if it wasn't for my input.

60
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,120
Why are you doing this to me?

61
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,200
This is my world.

62
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,200
Plea...

63
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,200
Right.

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,840

I can see that.

68
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,360
What have I told you
about smoking in my home?

69
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,520
I'm sorry.

70
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,960
I said smoking was unacceptable.

71
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,560
Do you remember me saying that?

72
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,680
Yes.

73
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,240
OK.

74
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,160
Well, as I've warned you before,

75
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
I don't want you
to clean for me any more.

76
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,480
OK, I not charge you this week.

77
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,280
It's not about the money,
Maya, it's about trust.

78
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,400
I really need this job.

79
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,680
You should've thought about that
before you polluted my apartment.

80
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,680
I want you to leave, now, please.

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,200
You do a good job.

86
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,880
Just...

87
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,440
please use the terrace
if you want to smoke.

88
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,840
What's that?

89
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Is mine.

90
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,200
Well, it's not, is it?

91
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,440
It's mine...

92
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,720
and you're going to
give it back to me. No!

93
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,160

not going through an agency!

OK, well, well... Let's go inside
and sit down for a while.

100
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,840
You've had an accident.

101
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,160
It was not accident.

102
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,880
You give me pills
and then I need to go.

103

109
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,680
I have to go now.

110
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,800
I think you should sit
and rest a while longer.

111
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,560

I feel terrible.

166
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,000
I've been at a client lunch
all afternoon,

167
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,240
and all I could think about was
getting over here.

168

I'm on your side.

..David asked me to take over your
accounts that...

172
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,960
Look, you know, I did as much as I
could do, but...

173
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,960
But I want you to know...

174

what it is, I'll do it.

First thing tomorrow morning, I'm
going to hook you up with Sally,

178
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,200
my head-hunter. She's brilliant.

179
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,200
There's nothing you can do, Tom.

180
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,720
Yes, I can. I really can.

181
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,120
Look, Sally will get you
a brilliant job, she's...

182
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,320
I couldn't care less.

183
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,840
It's about the baby.

184
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,440
What?

185
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,920
I know how horrible it must have
been for you, and...

186
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,560
You know, especially on top of everything
else that happened yesterday, but...

187
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry,

188
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,240
but I swear to you on little Grace's
life that I had no idea Jen was

189
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,240
going to bring her into the office
yesterday.

190
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,200
She did it on the spur of the moment.
I need you to leave, now, Tom.

191
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,120
No.

192
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,160
No...

193
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,000
We need to work through this.

194
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,720
The last thing I want is for all of
this to get in the way of us.

195
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,880
And...

196
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,880
I've got a free pass for
the whole night.

197
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,360
Come on.

198
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,200
What are you doing?

199
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,880
If you don't leave now, I'm going to
call your wife.

200
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,040
Right. I tried.

201
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,360
What a waste of time.

202
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,040
DOOR CLOSES

203
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,880
SHE CRIES

204
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,960
OK.

205
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,560
Mmmm.

206
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,440
Oh, what's this?
Healthy...

207
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,720
OK, what...?

208
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,760
Hang on. Mmm.

209
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,200
Softer, softer.

210
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
Softer, softer.

211
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,280
Softer, softer.

212
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,520
OK, bye. Thank you.

213
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,760
LIFT: 'Going up. Doors closing.'

214
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,440
'Doors opening.'

215
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,000
Shit.

216
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,200
BABY MURMURS

217
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,440
BABY CRIES

218
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,600
Shh, shh, shh.

219
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

220
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,120
I'm sorry.

221
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,520
I know. I know.

222
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,640
Ssshhhh.

223
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,960
Shh, shh, ssshhhh.

224
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,400
Sorry.

225
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,120
I'm so sorry.

226
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,800
And we've got a pink rose.

227
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,240
And rose rhymes with no-o-o-ose.

228
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,440
And pebbles. Clip-clop, clippety-clop,
clip-clop, clippety-clop.

229
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,280
It's like a horse's hooves.

230
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,960
Clip-clop, clippety-clop.

231
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,400
Shh, shh, shh, what's the matter?

232
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,720
Hmm? What's the matter?

233
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,160
What else should we look at?
Shall we look at the river?

234
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,080
See the river.
Can you see any boats?

235
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,480
Can we see any boats?

236
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,120
Oh!
BABY BURPS

237
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,680
Oh, oh, oh, dear.

238
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,400
Dear, dear.

239
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,440
Oh, dear, dear.

240
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,640
Oh, what a lovely baby!

241
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,400
Oh, I startled you there.

242
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,080
So sorry about that.

243
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,800
Oh, aren't you a beautiful
little girl?

244
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,880
Just like your mummy, eh?

245
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,600
Thank you. What's her name?

246
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,880
Um... Rosy.

247
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,200
Oh, that's a lovely name.

248
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,080
Agnes. I'm just saying hello to
the new neighbours.

249
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,080
We're moving in next week.

250
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,160
So, hope to see you again soon.

251
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,480
Bye-bye, Rosy.

252
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,360
Rosy.

253
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,920
Rosy.

254
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,600
Yeah.

255
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,960
Given the circumstances,
I want nine months gross

256
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,120
and I'm keeping the car.

257
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,000
OK.

258
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,960
Six months plus bonus.

259
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,200
And I want this resolved as soon
as possible, Simon.

260
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,160
Thank you. Bye.

261
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:58,520
BABY CRIES

262
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,840
What's the matter? Eh?

263
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,880
'Good evening, you're through to
the NHS 111 service.

264
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,200
'Can I take the number you're
dialling from, please?'

265
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,480
I've got a baby here and she's
really burning up.

266
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,200
'OK, if you could just let me have
that number you're calling from.'

267
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,160
Can you not help me? She's really sick.
'I'm afraid I must have that number first.'

268
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,120
BABY WAILS

269
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,920
God. Shh, shh, shh, sshhh.

270
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,720
It's OK.

271
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,720
Hi. All right?

272
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,760
You remember your Auntie Charlotte,
don't you?

273
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,600
Oh, two kisses now, eh?

274
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,600
You look fucking terrible, you do.

275
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,600
A nice pad, though, eh, Char?

276
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,880
Oh, my God, look at that view!

277
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,440
Come on, love, let's have a look.

278
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,720
Are we all right going out, Char?

279
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,960
Yeah. Come on, kid, let's have
a look.

280
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,080
Oh, my God!

281
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,920
It's gorgeous, isn't it?

282
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,080
Whooooo!

283
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,480
We're in London for the weekend.

284
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,400
Ah.

285
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,760
Let's have a look.

286
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,520
Well, she's all right.

287
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,160
I don't understand.

288
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,520
She was burning up before.

289
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,640
Yeah, well, babies get temperatures
all the time, it's no big deal.

290
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,720
I'm sorry, I didn't know what else
to do.

291
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,680
Well, even know-it-alls like you
can't know everything, eh, Char?

292
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,000
She's beautiful, isn't she?

293
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,120
She is, yeah.

294
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,080
Ah.

295
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,680
Little pudding.

296
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,240
There you go.

297
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,280
Ta.

298
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:37,520
So, she... She had cancer?

299
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,640
Yeah, breast cancer.

300
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,680
How old was she?

301
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,760
32.
What, and she had no other family?

302
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,840
No, not that I know of.

303
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,800
So, you've decided to take
the kid on?

304
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,080
Well, it was the least I could do.

305
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,080
I wish you'd contacted me sooner.

306
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,760
It just happened so quick,

307
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,400
we didn't even have time to tell
the authorities and whatnot.

308
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,880
I was worried she'd get taken
into care.

309
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,920
Right.

310
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,680
You want to stay clear of the
Social.

311
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,720
Be careful, yeah?

312
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,000
Thanks for the clothes.

313
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,720
That's all right, they were just, you know,
sitting in a cupboard, doing nothing.

314
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,560
It's a great help.

315
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,280
And it means a lot.

316
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,960
Um...I stink, can I borrow
your shower?

317
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,240
Yeah, but don't go using
all the hot water, young lady.

318
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,800
Yeah. You girls think money
grows on the bloody trees.

319
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,320
What are you up to?
I'm playing with my sister.

320
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,000
She's not your sister,
she's your cousin.

321
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,360
I want her to be my sister.

322
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:15,280
Why's that?
So I can play with her every day.

323
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,400
I think Rosy would like that.

324
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,880
Shit.

325
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,920
Hi.
Hiya. I saw you drop your box.

326
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,080
What? You know, on telly.

327
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,200
The old CCTV.

328
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,520
Can't tell you how much I love
this flat, Char.

329
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,720
It's amazing.

330
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,560
Are you all right?

331
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,120
Um... Yeah, yeah.

332
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,160
I've, um...

333
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,600
I've, I've left something at work,
I've come all this way home.

334
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,120
Can you just mind Rosy for a bit
longer while I go and sort it?

335
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,040
Oh, you are joking, aren't you?
We've come all this way to see you.

336
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,570
I'll be really quick.
Oh, it's fine.

337
00:51:47,595 --> 00:51:49,680
It's not like I'm not used
to you running off, eh?

338
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,600
Look, OK, tonight, when we get back,

339
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,000
I promise we'll sit down and we'll
have a good drink and a natter.

340
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,560
Right.

341
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,040
Stop by the chippy on the way back,
yeah? Yeah!

342
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,080
DOOR SHUTS

343

00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,080
Can I help you?
I didn't mean to barge in, I'm...

349
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,920
I live in the new apartments and...

350
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,760
I've been having trouble with
vandals.

351
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,320
Right. Well, I thought you might
have the CCTV footage.

352
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,240
What building would that be?

353
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,400
Westhill Tower.
OK, let's take a look.

354
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:22,000
Sorry about this place, eh?
Throw these flats up,

355
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,640
don't bother sorting out security.

356
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,960
They haven't even built us
an office yet.

357
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,840
I can't give out footage to
anyone except the police.

358
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,200
Oh. But I tell you what,
you report it to them,

359
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,640
and I'll see if I can get a picture
of the little bastards.

360
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,840
Great. I'll do that.
Thank you.

361

he's found your vandals on the CCTV.

380
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,560
She's beautiful.

381
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:46,120
Just like her mother.
I need to put her down.

You were so long, I had to give her
a sandwich and put her to bed.

390
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,400
It's only fishcakes.

391
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,160
Oh, don't bother me,
I am Hank Marvin.

392
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,720
One fish is bigger than the other,
so I'll give you more chips, right?

393
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,560
Is this the only vinegar
you've got, Char?

394
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,920
Yes, sorry.

395
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,840
And you forgot the gravy. No,
actually, down here in civilisation,

396
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:31,160
we don't do gravy on chips.

397
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,000
Oh, right.

398
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,960
Well, in that case, I better get us
a drink to wash it down with, eh?

399
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,040
Nice try with Westhill Tower.

400
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:49,720
Unfortunately, I spent a year
manning a checkpoint in Basra.

401
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:53,280
Kind of teaches you to remember
where you've seen a car before.

402
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:04,640
So, then, seeing as it's
so posh down here,

403
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,920
I thought we better make it
champagne.

404
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:09,640
What's this? Drinking the evidence?

405
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,360
What? Nothing.

406
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,640
Here, give it here.
You'll do someone an injury.

407
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,200
You don't mind, do you, Char?

408
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,200
There's loads of bottles in
the fridge.

409
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,000
No, it's... I just don't want any.

410
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,440
Oh, come on, sis.

411
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,280
No, really, I'm fine. Right, Rog,
pour Char a glass, will you?

412
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,960
Come on, you should be celebrating,
you've had a payoff.

413
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,160
Wow.

414
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,720

celebrate.

terrible he is,

417
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,040
can't handle his drink at all.

418
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,520
We've had, what, seven, eight pints,

419
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:09,400
and he has thrown up all
over himself.

420
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,160
Jesus! Seriously, right there in
the middle of the pub,

421
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,520
he is all over the place.

422
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,960
He's going, "Oh, my wife's going to
kick me out," you know,

423
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,920
"She said if I come home like this
one more time we're finished."

424
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,640
I said to him, "Chill out, pal.

425
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,600
"When you go home, have a £20 note
in your hand and say some geezer

426
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,680
"threw up on you and gave it to you
for the dry-cleaning."

427
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:31,200
So, he goes home, wife takes one
look at him, tries to chuck him out,

428
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,640
he goes, "No, no, no, no, no.

429
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,440
"When I was on the train home,
some geezer threw up on me,

430
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,520
"gave me a score for the
dry-cleaning."

431
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,080
She goes, "But you've got 40 quid
in your hand."

432
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,360
He goes, "Yeah. The other 20 quid is
from the geezer that shat in my pants."

433
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,520
You... You're full of shit.

434
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,080
No, straight up.

435
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:10,000
So, um...

436
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,280
So, what's the deal with
these vandals then, Char?

437
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,200
What? You know, the vandals.

438
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,240
What's been going on?

439
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,680
Oh, something went on in
the car park a few days back,

440
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,920
but I found it all on CCTV.

441
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,840
Oh, here you are,
let's have a look, then.

442
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:30,160
We can do if you want.
What do you reckon, Charlotte?

443
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,320
No. No?

444
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,200
No, you're right.
Save it for the police.

445
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,240
Let's have some more of this.

446
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,600
I know what you dodgy southerners
are like, eh?

447
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,200
Trying to take advantage of
young defenceless women.

448
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,840
No, no, you can trust me.

449
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:51,120
Yeah, right.
No, seriously, in a bad situation,

450
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,960
I'm the kind of guy you can rely on.

451
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,760
What do you want?

452
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,040
What do I want?

453
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,960
I want the toilet.

454
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,920
It's down the hall, you nutter.

455
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,120
Lovely.

456
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,800
What's the matter with you?

457
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,240
I want him out of here.

458
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,480
Oh, I knew it.
You're jealous, aren't you?

459
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:34,920
You don't know what you're getting
yourself into.

460
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,280
Don't you give me that
concerned sister bollocks.

461
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,240
Look, listen!

462
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,560
He is trouble. Oh, Jesus.

463
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,160
You can't handle a bloke liking me
instead of you, can you, eh?

464
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,480
He's trying to intimidate me.

465
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,765
You don't half rate yourself,
Char, always have done.

466
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:49,879
You think you're too good
for the rest of us. No!

467
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,952
You called me once in two years
and I come running down like a twat.

468
01:04:52,977 --> 01:04:54,600
You're a stuck-up,
self-centred cow.

469

You didn't even care
when your own dad died.

470
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,320
I paid for the funeral.

471
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,720
You didn't turn up for it, though,
did you? I was in Cape Town!

472
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:04,880
You didn't show up for the whole two
years that he was ill, either, Char.

473
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,600
OK. OK, I accept
there are issues...

474
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,560
You're too fucking right there's
issues...

475
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,640
But, please!

476
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,120
Please...

477
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,160
Listen to me.

478
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,160
We have got to get him out of here.

479
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:20,920
And then we're going to pack our stuff,
we're going to go back up North...

480
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,120
..and we're going to see each other
all the time, I promise.

482
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:27,680

Oh, sorry, sweetheart.

just having a little bit of fun, eh?

511
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:31,160
Come on, let's get you back to bed.
Come on, darling.

512
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,360

01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,280
What about the memory stick?
Yeah, yeah, that as well.

532
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,320
Don't do that.

533
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:06,160
I'm just giving myself another
option.

01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,840
Well, if you dick me about,

537
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,760
I could always take the kid as well.

538
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,400
Right.

539
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,440
Thanks for the chips.
Fishcake wasn't great, but hey-ho.

540
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,400
Oh, yeah. Your car.

541
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,640
What? I'm having your car as well.
Give me the keys.

542
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,480
Um...

543
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,800
Well, I'll need it on Thursday to
come to your office.

544
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,720
Fuck me, you've got an answer for
everything, haven't you?

545
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,440
All right.

546
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:49,800
But bring the paperwork with you.

547
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,440
Money. Give me some money.

548
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,400
I haven't got much on me. But you're
minted. Give me your wallet.

549
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:05,880

I don't know.

Yeah, that's the thing,
they don't badge them no more.

555
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,320
Can't nick 'em no more, either.

Give me the stick first.

Still got it all on the hard drive,
remember.

Hello, boss. Has your breakfast menu
started yet?

569
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,680
'Breakfast starts at 6.30, sir.'

570
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,640
All right, I'll get a...

571
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,920
..Chicken Royale and a chocolate
shake.

572
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,280
'Any fries with that, sir?'

573
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:13,640

That's it, boss-man. 'Thank you.'

576
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,360
What did you do with it, then?

577
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,080
What? The body.

578
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,120
What did you do with it?

579
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,600
Dump it somewhere? Burn it?

580
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,640
No.

581
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,240
What, then?

582
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,080
The river.

583
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,000
So, it will turn up, then.

584
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,480
It already has.

585
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:08,600
Yeah, they always do.

586
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,760
It's something to do with the currents, you
know, they never quite make it out to sea.

587
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,160
My uncle used to work on
a Woolwich Ferry, you see.

588
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,080
Uncle Frank.

589
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,520
Lovely bloke.

01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,880
Of course, you know the funny thing,
don't you?

593
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,280
I never would have found that footage if
you hadn't come sniffing round the office.

594
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:51,720
We never bother checking anything
unless it gets reported.

595
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:52,760
HE LAUGHS

596
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,360
Hey, this is nice, this, isn't it?

597
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,920
I need to go home, now.

598
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,160
Don't be like that.

599
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,800
Look, you've had your money.

600
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,040
Take me home.

601
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:10,960
Just trying to be friendly.

602
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,440
You're going the wrong way.

603
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:31,360
I'm going straight to work. You can
drive yourself home from there.

604
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:35,200
You don't want to do that.

605
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,640
I'm going to have to.
My shift finishes in 15 minutes,

606
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,800
and if I ain't there when Ravi gets
in, he'll grass me up.

607
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,880
Well, what about your bike?

608
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:46,200
It's well over 20 minutes
from your place on a bike.

609
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,560
I'll pick it up later.

610
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,880
Well, I need to get back to see
to Rosy.

611
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,160
Sarah's there. What's the biff?

612
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,960
Look, why don't you forget about
work?

613
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,000
We can...

614
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,120
We can hang out.

615
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,440
I can go back to the bank and get
some more money out.

616
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,880
Look, I'd love to,

617
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,240
but if I don't show up,
they'll know something's wrong.

618
01:17:11,240 --> 01:17:13,800
And this could get very messy if
we're not careful, babe.

619
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,760
No, the best thing we can do is
act normal.

620
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,760
I mean, all right,
you've made a mistake,

621
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,000
you're trying to put it right.

622
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,840
It's all good. But not everyone's
going to see it like that, are they?

623
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:30,080
So, it's very important that we don't
attract any attention to ourselves.

624
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:50,960
What the fuck?!

625
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,800
Fuck.

626
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,440
Open this door.

627
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,720
Open this fucking door!

628
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,200
Open this fucking door!

629
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:15,960
Shit.

630
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,680
Fucking loser...

631
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,440
Come on, you. Get up!

632
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:31,480
What? Now, did you tell him where
you're from last night?

633
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,480
What? Did you tell him where you're
from?

634
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,800
Oh, for God's sake, Char,
just leave it, will you?

635
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:38,520
Look, it's important nobody knows
I'm moving back up North.

636
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,640
Now, look, I'm being serious.

637
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,320
We are leaving in 15 minutes,
so get up!

638
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,720
What, you want to move back today?

639
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,320
Yes! I can't put you up, you know.

640
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,800
Well, I'll book a hotel!

641
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:17,120
Stacy. Stace.

642
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:19,600
Stacy, love. All right, trouble?

643
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:20,720
Eh?

644
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,720
How do you work this thing, Char?

645
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,400
Have you not got any instant?

646
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,040
Look, we haven't got time for this.

647
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,120
I can't go anywhere until I've had
my coffee.

648
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:35,840
I will buy you a Starbucks.

649
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,000
BANGING Open the door!
Open this fucking door!

650
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,800
Let me in! Is that Roger?

651
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,800
Right, I'm not having this.

652
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,240
Sarah, no! No! Roger, mate...
Don't, don't, don't!

653
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,280
Roger...

654
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,920
Get over here! Get here!

655
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,480
Fucking bitch!

656
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:54,760
Did you think you could just burn it
down and it would go away? Did you?!

657
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,040
I don't know! Did you?!

658
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,480
You fucking bitch, trying to mug me
off, you fuck!

659
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,800
Where's that memory stick?
Where's the stick?!

660
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:04,200
You don't know who you're dealing
with, you stuck-up Tampax mug!

661
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:07,720
Try and burn me out, try and make
me disappear like your cleaner?

662
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:10,120
Fucking bitch, get off me!
You fucking touch me?!

663
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,880
You fucking bitch!

664
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:14,040
You are fucking... You are fucked!

665
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:16,800
Where are you going?!
Where are you going?!

666
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,200
You're going nowhere!
Give me that stick!

667
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,480
I want it now! I threw...
I threw it away. Bollocks you did!

668
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,520
SHE SCREAMS

669
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,280
It's in my coat! It's in my coat.

670
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,640
What pocket? Fuck!

671
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,240
Give me that stick!

672
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:48,040
What difference does it make?
You can still have the money!

673
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,360
It makes a lot of difference now.
I'm taking the baby.

674
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,440
What? I know people, and that is
50 large in my pocket.

675
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:55,640
I will give you 50...
I'm having all your money!

676
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:57,760
I'm having the motor,
I'm having the baby!

677
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,960
So, just do as you're told and you
can go back to your nice shiny life.

678
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,440
There's nothing you can do. It was
never your kid in the first place.

679
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,480
It's mine now.

680
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:13,680
We...

681
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:19,800
We can work this out. Yeah?

682
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:58,240
The first time I saw him was when
he burst in this morning.

683
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,120
And you've never met him before?

684
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,000
No.

685
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,080
Never heard her talk about him?

686
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,480
No, I don't think so, no.

687
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:10,720
Did you notice anything else out of
the ordinary about your sister when

688
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:11,760
you came to stay?

689
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:15,720
ROSY GURGLES

690
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:16,920
Who's this?

691
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,520
It's my sister, Rosy.

692
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:24,720
Hello.

693
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,400
You want your mummy?

694
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:33,760
Here's Mummy.

695
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,240
Thank you.

696
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,280
Thank you.

697
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,640
It's OK.

698
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,000
Ssshhhh.

699
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:58,840
It's OK.

700
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:01,960
It's OK.
