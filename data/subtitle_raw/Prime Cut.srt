1
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,571
Take five.

2
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,429
Special order.

3
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,140
Hello.

4
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,878
Good night, sir.

5
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,089
Jake.

6
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,939
Go cool it, baby.

7
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,651
That broad, she could write a dirty book
and make it a bestseller in two weeks.

8
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,661
Jimmy, give us some drinks here.

9
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,425
How you been, Nick?
Been looking all over town for you.

10
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,296
Okay. How about yourself, Jake?

11
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:32,463
I got some trouble.
Big trouble in Kansas City with Mary Ann.

12
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,868
He's getting fat as a water rat.

13
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,138
He owes us a lot, Nick.
Close to a half a million.

14
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,902
He's skimming his own cream
and sticking Kansas right up my ass.

15
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,074
I need you to straighten him out.

16
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,376
So what's the tab?

17
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,713
$50,000.

18
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:51,115
Any way it cuts.

19
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,820
- Any way?
- Any way.

20
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,051
Go get yourself a bagman.

21
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:59,597
No, Nick, it's bigger than that. I need you.

22
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,361
Well, Jake, I'm kind of taking my ease.

23
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,401
Why don't you use your own boys?

24
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,605
I did, Nick.

25
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:11,536
I sent Kelly down there.
I sent Maguire down to look for him.

26
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,136
He found him in 10 feet of cowflop.

27
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,606
They found Maguire
floating down the Missouri.

28
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,712
And then I sent down Murphy.

29
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,355
Shaughnessy, bring that over here.

30
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,451
Take a look at that, Nick.

31
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,559
Go ahead, take a look.

32
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:53,582
Brings back bad memories, Nick.
Weenie and Mary Ann.

33
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,980
The pigsfoot brothers.
They knocked down on everyone.

34
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,957
And we knew them when.

35
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,370
I'll need some boys.

36
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,666
Delaney.

37
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:15,835
O'Brien.

38
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,269
Shaughnessy here.

39
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,043
They're good men, Nick.
They're young, but they're good...

40
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,947
and what's going on in this town,
the best I got.

41
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,825
Okay, they'll do fine.

42
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:41,162
Attaboy, Nick. See you around.

43
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,103
You'd better watch out.

44
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,373
You might have yourself another Clarabelle.

45
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,938
I never did have any taste, Nick.

46
00:11:56,015 --> 00:12:00,111
When you get to Kansas City,
don't say hello to Clarabelle for me.

47
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,085
What should I do with these, Mr. Devlin?

48
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,286
- Did you know Murphy?
- Yeah.

49
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,125
- Was he a good guy?
- Yeah, he was a good guy.

50
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,722
Then bury him.

51
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,299
Report for Chicago remains unchanged.

52
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,364
The heat wave continues into the fifth day...

53
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,774
with temperatures in the mid 90s
and high humidity.

54
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,143
All parts of the Midwest
are similarly affected...

55
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:31,308
and no relief is expected
for at least the next four to six days.

56
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,546
Meanwhile, conditions in the East
from Washington to New England...

57
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,987
are relatively cool,
with highs reaching the mid 80s.

58
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,187
That's news and weather for now,
more of the same at 9:00.

59
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,956
Now, back to Walter.

60
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,898
A whiff of the old times, eh, Nick?

61
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,934
- I'll take it, kid.
- Thanks.

62
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,614
Jump in, kid.

63
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:07,377
Would you meet my mother, Mr. Devlin?

64
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,813
Sure.

65
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,084
He's coming to meet you, Mom.

66
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,685
Oh, look, it's Mr. Devlin.

67
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,524
Nick says he wants to meet you, Mom.

68
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:28,197
- It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- The same, I'm sure, Mr. Devlin.

69
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,139
- How do you do?
- Hello.

70
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,441
Mom, I never saw anyone do that.

71
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,277
Jump in.

72
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,653
Corned beef and cabbage, eh, kid?

73
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,189
- Coffee, Nick?
- Yeah, okay.

74
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,064
I've never been to KC.

75
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,205
- It's all farmland, huh?
- Yeah.

76
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,339
- What do they grow there?
- Wheat, corn.

77
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,835
Jesus, what a bare-ass town.

78
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,790
Hang a left here.

79
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,663
Stay put.

80
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:13,618
One, three. One, four.

81
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,462
One, five. One, six.

82
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:22,961
One, seven. One, eight.

83
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,663
One, nine.

84
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:30,369
- What the...
- Nice to see you're in the same old rat hole.

85
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,507
I didn't expect to see you here, Nick.

86
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:43,916
You want some, Nick? It's kosher kiel.

87
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,033
Too bad, Weenie. That's your hot dog hand.

88
00:18:57,102 --> 00:19:00,629
You tell Mary Ann that I'm here,
and not to get any fancy ideas...

89
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,970
about turning me or any of my boys
into hamburger.

90
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,531
You got it?

91
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,144
Not hamburger.

92
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:12,206
Irish stew! Then grease!

93
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,569
Nice day.

94
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,278
We're all closed down. It's a private sale.

95
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,619
Country hospitality. Shit!

96
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,964
No, absolutely. She's great.

97
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:22,562
This guy says to the girl:
"That's not my ring, that's my wristwatch."

98
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,500
Nick.

99
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,239
Mary Ann.

100
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:36,311
- You're a sight for the old eyes.
- You, too.

101
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:39,009
How's life been treating you?
I heard you're back East.

102
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,312
Chicago.

103
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,280
Chicago?

104
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:48,625
- You know some of the guys, don't you?
- Yeah, I know some of the guys.

105
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,905
- You eat guts?
- Yeah.

106
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,210
I like them.

107
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,644
Talk now, eat later.

108
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,587
- You micks-
- Yeah, we got bad tempers.

109
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:33,666
George, slice up some more
meat there, will you?

110
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:36,033
Give them anything they want.

111
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,004
Dig in, guys.

112
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,101
Come on, dig in, will you?

113
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:43,209
American beef is better. Eat more meat.

114
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,679
I gotta talk some business here
with my friend Nick from Chicago.

115
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,958
Pretty fancy place you got here.

116
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,928
I thought you and Weenie
were in the meatpacking business.

117
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,866
Well, cow flesh, girl flesh.
It's all the same to me.

118
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,969
What they're buying, I'm selling.

119
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:08,736
What do you want, Nick?

120
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,241
The $500,000 you stiffed Chicago.

121
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,601
Nobody liked the hot dogs, Mary Ann.

122
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,707
- Maybe Jake'll like steak next time.
- Don't push.

123
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,043
Come on, Nick, smarten up.

124
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,910
Chicago's crumbling.

125
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:26,014
There's nothing left there anymore
but kids and old men.

126
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:29,857
What hasn't been burned down
has been shot out, picked over.

127
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:32,791
If it still moves, it's stuck in Joliet.

128
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:37,399
The East, who's running it?
Black boys? Puerto Ricans?

129
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,334
They got their own way of doing things.

130
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:42,339
- You talk their spic talk?
- SÃ­.

131
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,672
What do they got anybody wants,
rats and garbage?

132
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,770
You know what Chicago is?

133
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:53,006
Chicago is a sick old sow,
grunting for fresh cream.

134
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,809
What it deserves is slop.

135
00:25:56,788 --> 00:26:00,053
Someday, they're gonna
boil that town down for fat.

136
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,789
Here, it's different. This is the heartland.

137
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,990
Everybody wants what I got. Grade A.

138
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,894
Prime stuff, raised special.

139
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,099
Of course, we gotta keep them
a little doped up.

140
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:19,807
Uppers, downers,
all the livestock gets their shots.

141
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,111
Help me, please.

142
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,776
Why don't you come in with me, Nick?
It's good business.

143
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:32,687
No. You wallow in your own sewer.
Just get it up for Chicago.

144
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,523
It's the weekend, you know.
The banks are closed.

145
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,894
Banks get opened.
Easy or hard, they get opened.

146
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:44,793
You be at the fair tomorrow.
I'll give you what you want.

147
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,631
How much is girl flesh to go these days?

148
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,767
Well, the Blue Book is $20,
but for you it be $15.

149
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,038
Let's just say I'm taking her on account.

150
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,178
Yeah, real smart.
You and Jake, you think you're big men.

151
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:02,242
Walk in anywhere, you take down
your pants and I'll take down mine.

152
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,117
We'll see who's the biggest man.

153
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,623
Why don't we just ask Clarabelle?

154
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,954
How's the thumb, Weenie?

155
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:18,359
If it still hurts, why don't you
stick it in your mouth and suck?

156
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:53,838
Here, take care of things for me,
would you, please?

157
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:05,648
- Nicholas Devlin.
- Nick.

158
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,150
- Hello, Jerry. How are you?
- Good to see you, Nick.

159
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,949
- Have your reservations all ready.
- Good.

160
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,151
Show Mr. Devlin the Chicago Suite.

161
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:20,391
They used to call it the Presidential Suite,
but they don't stop in Kansas anymore.

162
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:23,161
Anything you need Nick, just ask.
You look fine.

163
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,134
You look good, too, pal.

164
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:31,034
- I'll take her.
- She's light as a baby.

165
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,536
Shay, she'll need some things.

166
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:38,480
Send somebody up
from the dress department.

167
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:56,957
All right, who deals?

168
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,380
All right, I put my ante in.

169
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,414
This is gonna cost you, fellas.

170
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,389
I open.

171
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:31,999
Hello, kid.

172
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,196
Hi.

173
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,411
I never saw anything so pretty.

174
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:51,779
It smells good.

175
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,414
I go the limit.

176
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,117
Straight Havana.

177
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:57,553
I've got a good nose.

178
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,894
- Smell a friend from a mile away, huh?
- You bet.

179
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:08,330
- What's your name?
- Nick. What's yours?

180
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,600
- Poppy.
- Hello, Poppy.

181
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,639
Am I your present?

182
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:21,176
No.

183
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,316
Protective custody.

184
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,887
Well, I guess that's not so bad.

185
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:21,238
Is this one okay?

186
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,668
There. Am I all right?

187
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,335
Just fine.

188
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,705
- Two, sir?
- Two, please.

189
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,699
- Would you prefer the dinner, sir?
- Yes, we'll have the dinner.

190
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:03,042
I believe the young lady
would like the consommÃ©...

191
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,611
and I'll have the vichyssoise.

192
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:46,014
Connie, white Jersey, $2,500.

193
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,581
We're gonna have the best fair ever.

194
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:51,247
Yep, we got the best damn fair ever.

195
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,447
Let me see that.

196
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,250
I'll get some liniment for that.

197
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:04,999
Shorthorn.

198
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,232
- It ain't gonna sting, is it?
- No.

199
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,073
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

200
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,347
- That's gonna heal just fine.
- Yeah.

201
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,651
See? It didn't hurt a bit.

202
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,092
- Not you, you old wart.
- You old cheese.

203
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,598
Goddamn old weevil, you!

204
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:39,466
- You old sow belly!
- You goddamn cowgut!

205
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,441
Okay.

206
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:59,455
I sure am glad you're my brother, Mary Ann.

207
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,390
Black Angus...

208
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,900
- Say you'll spit!
- I won't!

209
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:11,957
Say it!

210
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:15,005
Minneapolis. Frieda, Guernsey...

211
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:24,172
- You turd-head!
- You old skinny shit!

212
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,107
Glorybelle...

213
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,484
Hereford.

214
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:33,854
- How do you like our country ways?
- I've seen worse.

215
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,552
I think I got myself a smart-ass city slicker.

216
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:42,122
Uncut fresh coke, $85,000.

217
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,293
Mary Ann, you're a son of a bitch.

218
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,928
White Jersey, $2,000.

219
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,298
Yeah?

220
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,811
Poppy, white Jersey, on account.

221
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,545
On account? On account of what?

222
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:01,247
On account of Chicago, you little sheeny.

223
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:04,252
Chicago, Jezebel, Hereford...

224
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:12,854
For 100 years, men have slaughtered
these magnificent animals.

225
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:17,100
Ironically, the largest mammals
that walk the earth...

226
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,658
You going out?

227
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,098
You tore my shirt, you dummy.

228
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,604
I'm sorry.

229
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:26,472
Yeah, I'm going to that
Chamber of Commerce soirÃ©e.

230
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,945
I'll pick up Clarabelle down at the boat.

231
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,847
Do you suppose Clarabelle's
got an old dress she don't need?

232
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,011
What?

233
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,216
- I sort of wanna borrow a dress.
- What are you talking about?

234
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,953
She's got a lot of dresses up there
and I'd just like to-

235
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:44,927
Her dresses don't fit you.

236
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,930
- Mary Ann.
- Yeah, go on.

237
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,697
She buys enough to stuff a silo.

238
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,365
Don't bust a gut.

239
00:37:56,374 --> 00:38:00,105
I never knew a man before,
not even to talk to.

240
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,311
Well, where did they keep you?

241
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:06,009
In the orphanage with the other girls.

242
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,012
And where was that?

243
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:12,487
It was in Missouri.
It's the only home I really remember.

244
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,421
It was in the country.

245
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,156
Then you have nobody?

246
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:18,593
Just Violet.

247
00:38:18,663 --> 00:38:19,687
Who?

248
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:23,359
Violet. The other girl that was with me.
She's my sister.

249
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:27,367
Well, not truly, but we're closer than that.

250
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,275
Violet and me,
we'd climb into each other's bed...

251
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:35,574
when it was really cold in the wintertime,
and hug each other really close.

252
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,547
Sometimes, we'd touch each other...

253
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:41,449
and dream how men's hands
would feel on us.

254
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,857
I'd talk to her in a really deep voice
and I'd say, "I love you, Violet."

255
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:50,185
And I'd kiss her so she wouldn't cry.

256
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,390
We tried to run away once.

257
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,796
But the old woman caught us.

258
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:05,565
She said we couldn't leave,
that we were being raised up special.

259
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,443
But that when we were done, there'd be
lots of handsome men loving us forever.

260
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:16,210
You didn't really believe that, did you?

261
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:20,951
No. You could tell they were lying,
but it didn't matter much...

262
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,823
'cause in the spring,
we'd run out into the fields...

263
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,692
and there'd be sunshine and new rain...

264
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:30,598
and I'd be a squirrel, and a rabbit,
and a badger...

265
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:33,364
and then I'd fall down and feel the earth...

266
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:37,430
and in an instant, I'd know that being alive
was just everything.

267
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:39,975
I like that.

268
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,001
Do you truly?

269
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,680
Truly.

270
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,750
Say my name.

271
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:49,979
Poppy.

272
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:52,889
Say it again.

273
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:27,577
Violet?

274
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,759
Violet's a real pretty name.

275
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,374
Put it on.

276
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:22,936
You're beautiful, Violet. Yeah, you are.

277
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:27,577
You're as beautiful as anybody I ever seen.

278
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,612
If you do real good...

279
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:34,207
I'll take you to the fair.

280
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,152
Yeah, I will.

281
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:14,081
Jayhawker Fair souvenirs.
Who's gonna have one?

282
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:17,851
...will be declared ineligible
to be shown to judges.

283
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,455
Those entering in the wrong categories
will be disqualified...

284
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,290
- ... here in the flank. Got that?
- Yep.

285
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:33,459
Knock them down and win a prize.

286
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,324
Cotton candy coming up.

287
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:08,833
A young girl at a fair
and she doesn't see anything but her man.

288
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,775
- I love him.
- Do you, now?

289
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:14,142
Well, he's a fine one.

290
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,771
He is, isn't he?

291
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:19,742
He is who he is.

292
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:22,618
If you could see under this jacket,
you'd know.

293
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:26,417
Four slugs I took in this gut.
But Nick wouldn't let me die.

294
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,220
Was it in the war?

295
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,224
You might say that.

296
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,196
Very good.

297
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:39,534
How about you?
You want to shake my hand? All right.

298
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:43,835
Good. Got your hair cut, didn't you?
Used to be way down to there.

299
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:46,302
Okay, here we are.

300
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:51,213
Third prize for you,
you old sweet doll, you, you little devil.

301
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:56,014
Here you are, first prize. Congratulations.

302
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:58,245
Joe.

303
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:01,917
Okay. Take it to the ranch, will you?

304
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,597
- I'll just lighten you up.
- Thank you.

305
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,999
Real fine beef you got there, sonny.

306
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,833
Count them out, Joe.

307
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,036
Come on.

308
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,341
He's a pet.

309
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:24,003
You go home and fatten up
another one for me, hear?

310
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,851
Do you wanna buy a goat?

311
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:30,277
No.

312
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:51,939
He's the expert from Chicago.
I heard people talking.

313
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:55,573
Well, what do you think? Was it all right?

314
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,671
Right tasty. It's smooth.

315
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,309
The milk?

316
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,414
Well?

317
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:09,151
Well, the fact is, I think
I'd better have a little more.

318
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,168
Full body.

319
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:24,201
You're certainly a man who knows his milk.

320
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:27,266
Well, you're certainly a woman
who knows milk.

321
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:32,347
First prize.

322
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,314
Violet!

323
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:50,963
Violet, it's so good to see...

324
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,969
Violet? It's me, Poppy.

325
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,564
She ain't feeling so good.

326
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:04,780
We're gonna work real hard
and get a first next year, aren't we?

327
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,611
Huh? Right?

328
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:08,446
How about you?

329
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:10,543
Nick, we were waiting on you.

330
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:12,714
Judging the price of kids, huh?

331
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,781
No, not these little hunkers.
I wouldn't give them away.

332
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:18,225
They're right smart Kansas kids.

333
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,895
- What are you looking at?
- Me. Hello, Nick.

334
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,764
Clarabelle.

335
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,659
Well, it looks just like old times.

336
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:28,437
Hello, Shay.

337
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,870
- Your old bull won first prize.
- Hey, how about that?

338
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,607
Don't she look swell, Nick?

339
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,909
She dresses better than the Governor's wife.

340
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,509
Clarabelle could always think ahead.

341
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:46,586
You haven't changed a bit, Nick.

342
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:49,091
Nobody does. Not where it counts.

343
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:51,989
I'll have to chew on that for a while.

344
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:54,656
No. You ain't gonna chew on anything.

345
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,424
Just go and talk to the Senator.

346
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:59,298
See you around, Nick.

347
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:03,833
What do you think of all this, Nick?

348
00:49:05,142 --> 00:49:06,871
I think it stinks.

349
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:08,742
You would.

350
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:11,538
All you know is concrete.

351
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:14,143
You know, my family were Americans...

352
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:17,015
when yours was still digging the bugs
out of Irish potatoes.

353
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,612
Go on, wave a flag and make me laugh.

354
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,955
Wait a minute.
You think I don't know this country?

355
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,695
I know it. This is my country.

356
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:31,594
I give it just what it wants: dope and flesh.

357
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:35,331
Something up the arm,
something to lick around the belly.

358
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:37,965
Did you have a good time last night?

359
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,211
Joe.

360
00:49:58,428 --> 00:50:01,886
Joe. I thought you were back
in New York with Uncle Frank.

361
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:03,432
Times change.

362
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:10,167
- Don't they?
- This is not Chicago, Nick.

363
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,337
No Loops, no taxis.

364
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:14,706
This is my country.

365
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:17,607
You just bought the farm.

366
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,615
Not me. You.

367
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,285
Mary Ann, the turkey shoot's about to begin.

368
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,220
Let's win us a prize.

369
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,488
Just let my boys show you around.

370
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,662
You little...

371
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,634
Violet!

372
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,346
That ain't fair.

373
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,710
- I'll go for the car. Keep looking.
- Yeah.

374
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:44,951
Center target.

375
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:46,928
Contestant number two.

376
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:51,100
We'll shoot off all of our turkeys later on.

377
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:59,135
Six hits to center target.

378
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:02,870
Contestant number three, you may fire.

379
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:19,755
Will the young lady and gentleman
in their Sunday go-to-meeting clothes...

380
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:22,696
- please clear the track?
- Out of my way, all of you. Now move.

381
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:26,300
You are dangerously close to the firing line.

382
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,902
Go, go, go.

383
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:33,805
Contestant number three
scored five hits to center target.

384
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,367
No, I'm sorry.

385
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,615
Over there.

386
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:49,984
- How you kids doing?
- Fine.

387
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:51,455
Just... Out of my way. Move.

388
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:36,459
Damned if I see him anywhere.

389
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:37,625
Me, neither.

390
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:40,295
Maybe they're still hiding in the woods.

391
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:41,225
- How you doing, kid?
- Okay.

392
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,928
I'm sorry it was a lousy fair.

393
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:45,833
But what...

394
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:48,830
They're trying to kill you.

395
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,597
Well, that's nothing new.

396
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:56,001
- How's your spunk, kid?
- Okay.

397
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,603
Okay, let's go.

398
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,317
What have they done to Violet?

399
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,553
The same thing
they would have done to you.

400
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:37,547
Get up!

401
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:36,238
There they are!

402
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,044
Now!

403
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:07,759
- Take care of her.
- Yeah.

404
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,025
Oh, and find some wheels
to fit between those.

405
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:12,624
- I'll see you back at the hotel.
- Yeah, Nick, okay.

406
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:14,363
Thanks for the lift, kid.

407
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:17,463
Look, buy your club a case of beer.

408
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:19,333
Hello, Nick.

409
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:22,030
Hello, Clarabelle.

410
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:26,673
I thought you might come around
to see an old friend.

411
01:02:30,279 --> 01:02:32,804
Well, I certainly wouldn't miss you.

412
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:36,414
I gave all my sailors a long shore leave.

413
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:39,011
Well, they probably needed the rest.

414
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,888
Haven't you heard, Nick? I'm a good woman.

415
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:47,089
What's it like to be married?

416
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,855
- Well, it's-
- To Mary Ann?

417
01:02:55,872 --> 01:03:00,241
He does just fine for me.
He loves me better than his blue-ribbon bull.

418
01:03:01,344 --> 01:03:04,313
And I have a house in the Riviera
in my own name...

419
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:07,816
and a ton of Hong Kong gold
stuffed in a Swiss bank...

420
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:10,880
and a cosmetic factory, fancy-smelling.

421
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:14,122
Pig grease, and fat, and slop.

422
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:18,090
And I live in a yacht named Clarabelle.

423
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:20,891
And it feels great.

424
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:28,197
- You've won.
- Yeah.

425
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:36,469
- We've come a long way, Nick.
-604 miles.

426
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:40,875
They tell good stories about you now.

427
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,277
- Good tough ones.
- Hard ones.

428
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:51,622
What did you come here for,
Mary Ann or me?

429
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:52,956
Mary Ann.

430
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:01,562
Mary Ann's in the icehouse freezing things.

431
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,973
Me, I'm already thawed.

432
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,804
Miss Chicago?

433
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:14,772
Stick Chicago.

434
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,514
But I've missed you, Nick.

435
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:20,556
- It was great being your girl.
- Yeah, but we wore it out.

436
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:23,091
No. We could still make it together again.

437
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:26,617
I'm very young,
and I wouldn't even mind being a widow.

438
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:36,461
You're really something, Clarabelle.

439
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,732
You really are.

440
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:46,881
Did you set up Mary Ann against Chicago...

441
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:50,042
just for old times' sake?

442
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:52,550
I don't run Mary Ann.

443
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:57,558
I just push a man as far as he will go
and hope to hell it's the graveyard.

444
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:59,959
Then you'd better make it quick.

445
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,422
'Cause I'm liable to beat you to it.

446
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:27,990
What the hell are you doing?

447
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:30,218
Kicking your ass down to Missouri.

448
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:31,817
Son of a bitch!

449
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:58,047
Code 2.

450
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:03,649
- Mary Ann's boys broke in, Nick.
- They used a sawed-off shotgun.

451
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:05,318
- What about the girl?
- They got her.

452
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:08,124
Shaughnessy and I,
we were in the garage getting a new car.

453
01:06:08,197 --> 01:06:09,858
- Everything's in it.
- Let's go.

454
01:06:44,133 --> 01:06:46,033
Let's get out of here.

455
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:17,392
Violet?

456
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:37,415
Weenie was all through with me.

457
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,246
Really through.

458
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,792
He said they could love me for a nickel.

459
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:56,527
He brought Poppy here,
and he made her watch.

460
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:25,862
God damn them, Shay.

461
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:29,464
God damn them, kid.

462
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,862
- They'll be waiting.
- Yeah.

463
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:04,362
All staked out.

464
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:08,635
Yeah.

465
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:14,510
It don't bother me.

466
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:17,241
Don't it, kid?

467
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,247
Nope.

468
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:42,872
God damn them, Shay.

469
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:54,077
Come on, Big!

470
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:16,436
You stay here. I'll be back for you.

471
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,163
Just do as you're told, friend,
and keep moving.

472
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:16,865
Faster.

473
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:26,781
Turn in here. Do it!

474
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:02,967
He's coming in.

475
01:19:55,357 --> 01:19:57,188
You're up next, Nick.

476
01:20:41,937 --> 01:20:43,234
Mary Ann?

477
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:10,088
Nick!

478
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:00,030
Kill me, Nick.

479
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:06,175
Finish me off, Nick.

480
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:10,577
Do it!

481
01:23:14,923 --> 01:23:16,788
You would for a beast.

482
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,627
You're a man.

483
01:23:20,795 --> 01:23:22,660
There's no difference.

484
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:24,665
You're wrong.

485
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:27,264
There is.

486
01:24:31,433 --> 01:24:33,128
Well, what do you want?

487
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:34,896
Them. All of them.

488
01:24:37,839 --> 01:24:39,864
Say, who do you think you are?

489
01:24:41,009 --> 01:24:42,636
J. Edgar Hoover.

490
01:24:43,912 --> 01:24:46,437
- This is an orphanage.
- And I'm adopting.

491
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:48,379
- Shay, get them out.
- A pleasure, Nick.

492
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:52,819
You can't come in...
Hey, wait a minute. I know you.

493
01:24:52,887 --> 01:24:54,320
You sure do.

494
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:00,925
You've got fine style.

495
01:25:00,995 --> 01:25:02,986
Glad you think so, Nick.

496
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:08,702
Olive. Hi, Daisy. How are you?

497
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:23,373
Where are you taking me?

498
01:25:24,152 --> 01:25:25,676
Tell me where.

499
01:25:26,354 --> 01:25:27,582
Chicago.

500
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:30,951
Chicago. What's it like?

501
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:35,190
Well, it's windy...

502
01:25:36,498 --> 01:25:37,829
and calm...

503
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,391
and peaceful as any place anywhere.
