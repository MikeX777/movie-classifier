1
00:00:29,718 --> 00:00:34,497
Based on a true story

2
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,766
First edition
blood sand and gold

3
00:00:41,696 --> 00:00:42,766
1990 August

4
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:45,608
Iraq's Saddam Hussein

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,773
Leading an army of 12
million invaded Quetta

6
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,709
Controlled the
nation within a short time

7
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,517
Iraq who ignored
the public's objection

8
00:00:53,508 --> 00:00:54,680
refuse to retreat

9
00:00:54,776 --> 00:00:56,653
With United
States as the leader

10
00:00:56,645 --> 00:00:58,647
multinational
joint army of 50 million

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,661
Near Quetta's borders rapidly

12
00:01:02,517 --> 00:01:04,724
After new year of 1991 January

13
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,496
with the retreating
deadline getting nearer

14
00:01:08,523 --> 00:01:09,501
Under such

15
00:01:09,524 --> 00:01:10,502
critical condition

16
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,606
Japan accepted the invitation to
join the arm forces from U.S.

17
00:01:13,628 --> 00:01:15,608
Pressured under the

18
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:17,634
no. 19 statutory law

19
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:20,736
Get out

20
00:01:21,536 --> 00:01:22,640
Dear Lily Alice

21
00:01:22,637 --> 00:01:23,672
boycott you

22
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:25,540
Classy

23
00:01:26,675 --> 00:01:27,710
But how do you
want me to help you

24
00:01:27,742 --> 00:01:29,619
If you didn't
sleep with that woman

25
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:34,591
Alright looks like we
took some advertisement papers

26
00:01:34,783 --> 00:01:36,694
With her pants

27
00:01:36,685 --> 00:01:38,596
begged her not to
get involve in this

28
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:43,559
Alright alright

29
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:45,567
Take good care of Beck

30
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:48,631
And bring me some good stuffs

31
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:51,607
I'll take care of everything

32
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:55,578
Thank you for calling me

33
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,575
After that

34
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:03,551
If we go
according to my instincts

35
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:06,583
from 80 billion
dollars to 100 billions dollars

36
00:02:06,748 --> 00:02:09,752
If its one of us
then say 90 billion

37
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,566
90 billion dollars
easy for you to say

38
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:16,635
No I didn't say that

39
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:17,636
the Washington suggested it

40
00:02:17,726 --> 00:02:21,606
40 billion dollar was added
last year have you forgotten

41
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:24,611
Total there's 130 billion

42
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,772
what do you want
me to tell the people

43
00:02:29,604 --> 00:02:30,605
Good tea

44
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,520
If you're really networking

45
00:02:35,644 --> 00:02:40,684
Networking'? You can't
say this is networking

46
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:42,550
What do you mean

47
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:45,595
Japan will not send their army

48
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,599
The opponent knows
about this weakness

49
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:51,571
So you can't bargain anymore

50
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:54,569
For democracy
and help them fight

51
00:02:54,596 --> 00:02:55,666
is the youngsters' mission

52
00:02:55,697 --> 00:02:56,675
Its because of statutory law

53
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:58,541
no. 19 that we...

54
00:02:58,566 --> 00:02:59,636
The other party
should know very well

55
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:01,544
But they insist that

56
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:03,571
backup is possible

57
00:03:04,673 --> 00:03:06,744
Of course they're
not interested in our

58
00:03:06,775 --> 00:03:09,722
country's backup army theory

59
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:13,522
But it's the
multinational's decision

60
00:03:13,581 --> 00:03:15,652
Bring merciful is
not working anymore

61
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,596
I'm afraid
there's no options anymore

62
00:03:19,654 --> 00:03:20,758
Its because of this we

63
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:22,598
should do this
with determination

64
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:24,626
This is what the
other party wants

65
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:26,765
Normally facing
this kind of situation

66
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:28,604
you'll enter into a dilemma

67
00:03:28,763 --> 00:03:31,505
Logic doesn't work

68
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,770
It'll only make
the matters worst

69
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:35,503
Put it simply just use
money and get out of it

70
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,805
You take people as fools

71
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:41,647
Fujiwara-kun are
you satisfied with this

72
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:46,754
Japan already lost in this war

73
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:50,558
Of course there's no country

74
00:03:50,552 --> 00:03:52,532
can go against U.S. now

75
00:03:52,654 --> 00:03:56,568
The problem of
this war is the people

76
00:03:56,558 --> 00:04:00,665
are not prepared for this war

77
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:03,766
Do you know what
you're talking about

78
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,704
Regretfully

79
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:33,630
January 17 joint
military starred to

80
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:35,732
invade Iraq

81
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:39,541
This is "War of Desert"

82
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:41,645
After a week

83
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:44,809
Japan decided to
pump 15 billion dollars in

84
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:46,677
Bore 5 more billion

85
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:48,745
its affecting our budget

86
00:04:49,677 --> 00:04:51,623
But nobody shows any gratitude

87
00:05:09,597 --> 00:05:13,511
Second edition Sergeant Kuhio

88
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:30,621
What are you looking at

89
00:05:30,652 --> 00:05:31,653
Trees

90
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:32,721
Trees

91
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,710
Everyone come and have a look

92
00:05:55,643 --> 00:06:00,592
Here stand properly

93
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:03,751
Look over here

94
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:08,591
This is Kuri-take
mushroom and its poisonous

95
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,570
you might die if you eat it

96
00:06:11,593 --> 00:06:12,697
Mushrooms are
definitely nice to eat

97
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:13,762
But this really looks like

98
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:15,536
a real mushroom

99
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,509
lot of people mistaken it

100
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:40,755
You don't like children right

101
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:40,753
This is Kuri-take and it's
a type of poisonous mushroom

102
00:07:43,718 --> 00:07:45,789
Its really poisonous

103
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:49,564
When we invaded Panama

104
00:07:49,557 --> 00:07:51,503
The remaining army died

105
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:53,494
after eating these

106
00:07:54,662 --> 00:07:55,663
Panama?

107
00:08:01,602 --> 00:08:05,573
Panama is over there

108
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:23,568
They called me in the morning

109
00:08:23,558 --> 00:08:26,664
and they're more than willing
to make us the wedding dress

110
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:28,506
Really

111
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,668
Because it's a Japanese bride

112
00:08:30,698 --> 00:08:33,645
so I asked them to
use Kimono as the theme

113
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:36,646
They manage to get the

114
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:38,617
special materials

115
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,550
Where they used it for
Princess Diana's wedding dress

116
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:41,676
Mr. Kemo

117
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,711
Mr. Kemo?

118
00:08:44,645 --> 00:08:45,783
Italy called someone Kemo

119
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,760
to find high quality silk

120
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,620
Have you checked

121
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,760
Because you said
you asked for help

122
00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:56,531
from the dresser who
made Princess Diana's dress

123
00:08:57,725 --> 00:08:58,703
Harder

124
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:00,762
Harder

125
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:05,509
Fighting jet's uniform

126
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:07,604
when the pilot is flying

127
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:08,774
Will automatically
tighten up at the calf's

128
00:09:09,537 --> 00:09:10,641
If you don't make up your mind

129
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:11,741
you'll lose your pride

130
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,780
So the pilot's calf

131
00:09:13,808 --> 00:09:16,618
will be more
stiff than normal people

132
00:09:19,614 --> 00:09:20,718
Thank you

133
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:22,652
Its your turn

134
00:09:23,684 --> 00:09:24,754
Forget about me

135
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,520
Quick from the arm that's
why you need to sleep facing up

136
00:10:00,788 --> 00:10:04,565
You don't wear bra when
you're wearing a bath robe right

137
00:10:06,794 --> 00:10:08,637
Change another hand

138
00:11:46,594 --> 00:11:47,698
I don't hate children

139
00:11:47,762 --> 00:11:49,571
I think so too

140
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:52,642
I feel unbelievable myself too

141
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:54,476
why do I have to say such thing

142
00:11:54,669 --> 00:11:58,617
So I came here to
apologize really sorry

143
00:12:00,775 --> 00:12:01,753
Will you still be here

144
00:12:01,776 --> 00:12:03,722
I'll send these
documents over first

145
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:04,745
Please wait for a while

146
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:12,720
<i>Come in</i>

147
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:14,623
Sorry to disturb

148
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:23,503
I'm leaving now

149
00:12:23,731 --> 00:12:25,677
Wait stop

150
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:27,568
Just a kiss

151
00:12:27,602 --> 00:12:28,603
Kiss?

152
00:12:28,636 --> 00:12:29,706
Can't do it here

153
00:12:30,738 --> 00:12:32,513
I don't mean that

154
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,679
didn't you say we
must keep a distance

155
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:38,484
Don't you remember

156
00:12:40,648 --> 00:12:41,626
Yesterday didn't you forgive

157
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:43,526
me over the phone

158
00:12:44,518 --> 00:12:45,519
Phone?

159
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:53,537
I know you're drunk

160
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:55,598
but you really don't remember

161
00:12:56,497 --> 00:12:58,499
Yes just like that

162
00:12:58,532 --> 00:13:00,603
its over between us

163
00:13:01,535 --> 00:13:02,775
But we love each other so much

164
00:13:03,604 --> 00:13:05,515
That's what I hate the most

165
00:13:10,745 --> 00:13:12,656
When do you want
to pass up the report

166
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,557
about the child
observing the mushroom

167
00:13:14,548 --> 00:13:15,583
One day he'll hand up

168
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:01,536
Please register

169
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:02,596
check in please

170
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:04,601
check in please

171
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:03,661
You might be right

172
00:15:03,657 --> 00:15:05,637
about me disliking children

173
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,538
That time it could be

174
00:15:07,561 --> 00:15:09,700
I'm thinking about something

175
00:15:10,664 --> 00:15:12,507
lot of things happened lately

176
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:15,611
But do you really know

177
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,613
I can see it too

178
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:18,649
5 minutes ago

179
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:21,516
where and what were you doing

180
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:26,624
I lied I don't
have such capability

181
00:15:27,782 --> 00:15:30,729
I just finished
my mission yesterday

182
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:33,527
was at 1 million
and 6000 feet in the sky

183
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:35,498
After doing such job

184
00:15:35,523 --> 00:15:38,504
you'll still have some
form of instincts with you

185
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:39,762
You're a pilot

186
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:42,732
I forgot to introduce myself

187
00:15:42,763 --> 00:15:45,710
my name is
Johansen Elizabeth Kuhio

188
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,704
Marines from the U.S.

189
00:15:47,735 --> 00:15:50,614
Pilot for the land army

190
00:15:56,777 --> 00:15:58,654
Is she American

191
00:15:58,746 --> 00:16:00,623
My father's ancestors were

192
00:16:00,648 --> 00:16:01,718
born in Hawaii

193
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,554
So looks like a Japanese

194
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,690
Japanese is fluent

195
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:09,790
Yes French German

196
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,533
Japanese were taken
up after I join the army

197
00:16:14,628 --> 00:16:17,609
I'm always around
here because of my duties

198
00:16:17,731 --> 00:16:21,543
Staying in the
hotel opposite the forest

199
00:16:22,536 --> 00:16:24,516
Very expensive right

200
00:16:24,605 --> 00:16:27,711
Oh sorry you're
still working right

201
00:16:43,657 --> 00:16:44,658
Who was that

202
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:46,635
U.S. pilot

203
00:16:46,694 --> 00:16:47,764
The person
mentioned in the phone

204
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:49,570
is the one that
said something weird

205
00:16:49,597 --> 00:16:50,598
When all of you went for patrol

206
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:51,699
Phone?

207
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:54,644
Not only Mr. Takahashi

208
00:16:54,668 --> 00:16:56,773
you called me too

209
00:16:57,605 --> 00:16:59,642
I caught a flu because of this

210
00:16:59,707 --> 00:17:00,708
sorry

211
00:17:00,774 --> 00:17:02,776
I gain extra one kilogram

212
00:17:02,776 --> 00:17:04,551
I don't care about that

213
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:09,591
I know its urgent

214
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,756
but I'll go back very soon

215
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:15,529
Did Mr. Tabe Goro came

216
00:17:16,657 --> 00:17:18,637
He called to say
he's going to be late

217
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:19,660
Oh when he comes

218
00:17:19,693 --> 00:17:21,695
tell him that this
month's payment will be late

219
00:17:21,795 --> 00:17:23,672
The receipt is written

220
00:17:23,664 --> 00:17:24,768
a little bit
more time is alright

221
00:17:26,534 --> 00:17:27,569
Then there is

222
00:17:29,637 --> 00:17:32,584
Then depending on you

223
00:17:35,776 --> 00:17:37,756
Do you have a cheaper room

224
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:39,690
Are there any

225
00:17:39,713 --> 00:17:40,691
<i>cheaper rooms'?</i>

226
00:17:53,694 --> 00:17:55,605
Before learning English

227
00:17:55,629 --> 00:17:57,540
you have to be polite to people

228
00:17:57,565 --> 00:17:58,703
Have you read this before

229
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,540
Yes

230
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:02,636
Once is not enough

231
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,616
you must know it
from back to front

232
00:18:05,573 --> 00:18:07,575
As my wife

233
00:18:07,575 --> 00:18:09,486
you have to attend
all kinds of functions

234
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:10,749
Must know the
current issues very well

235
00:18:11,512 --> 00:18:13,514
So I'm learning English

236
00:18:14,682 --> 00:18:16,525
I like English

237
00:18:16,517 --> 00:18:17,587
In high school

238
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:20,690
I got second place
in English language

239
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:24,662
But because I have
to help out at home

240
00:18:24,692 --> 00:18:25,727
Wrapped it inside

241
00:18:35,536 --> 00:18:38,608
The rest will be
sent over after a week

242
00:18:42,576 --> 00:18:43,748
After this mission finished

243
00:18:44,511 --> 00:18:46,548
I'll report to Commander Johan

244
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:48,527
about me getting married

245
00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:50,523
Remember you
said after you join us

246
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:52,528
The army will supply us

247
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:54,726
with 5 million yen

248
00:19:00,561 --> 00:19:01,631
Oh that's salary receipt

249
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:08,706
So little money
after a long day work

250
00:20:51,605 --> 00:20:54,552
I'm doubting I should buy

251
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:58,581
Exactly the same as the
one I saw in Nice last year

252
00:20:58,712 --> 00:21:00,658
But the price is different

253
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:13,527
Please be careful

254
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:14,562
Thank you

255
00:21:17,664 --> 00:21:23,580
Excuse me how much is that

256
00:21:24,738 --> 00:21:27,651
Including the
tax is 390 thousands

257
00:21:29,543 --> 00:21:30,647
I bought it

258
00:21:32,613 --> 00:21:33,614
Please wait

259
00:21:39,653 --> 00:21:42,497
Thank you for your suggestion

260
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:45,561
please do visit

261
00:22:00,707 --> 00:22:02,709
Are you paying with credit card

262
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,545
I don't want

263
00:22:14,588 --> 00:22:15,566
How dangerous

264
00:22:20,727 --> 00:22:21,762
Why

265
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,701
Here where is that

266
00:22:27,634 --> 00:22:32,743
You're asking for
directions its there

267
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:35,713
Turn right over there

268
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:38,588
walk for hundred meters
and you can see a flower shop

269
00:22:38,645 --> 00:22:39,646
I don't understand

270
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,760
What do you mean
didn't I say its there

271
00:22:42,516 --> 00:22:43,494
I don't understand

272
00:22:43,684 --> 00:22:45,755
That see over there

273
00:22:45,786 --> 00:22:47,527
Its not there its here

274
00:22:47,521 --> 00:22:48,522
Over there right

275
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:53,629
Its not there its here

276
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,641
Reached

277
00:23:11,678 --> 00:23:13,658
No its not there

278
00:23:14,748 --> 00:23:17,558
Why don't you know
how to open the car door

279
00:23:18,518 --> 00:23:19,656
Enough don't touch anymore

280
00:23:40,641 --> 00:23:42,712
Sorry I want to
give it to you as a gift

281
00:23:42,709 --> 00:23:44,746
that's why I came
and find you immediately

282
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:50,762
Although its still a
bit early but if you do

283
00:23:59,626 --> 00:24:01,503
Your Japanese is really fluent

284
00:24:01,561 --> 00:24:04,701
No although my
father is Hawaiian

285
00:24:04,765 --> 00:24:07,644
But he's always
mistaken as Japanese

286
00:24:07,768 --> 00:24:11,739
So he decided to learn Japanese

287
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,776
But to be able to speak so well

288
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:17,756
Mr. Kuhio is really capable

289
00:24:19,546 --> 00:24:22,618
Ms. Michiko is really capable

290
00:24:22,749 --> 00:24:23,750
Oh how should I put it

291
00:24:24,718 --> 00:24:29,565
Ms. Michiko
doesn't like this job right

292
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,770
Yes I hate it

293
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,707
I don't like to
socialize from the start

294
00:24:36,697 --> 00:24:40,509
and it bothers me to stay here

295
00:24:41,535 --> 00:24:44,675
But to be seen
as a career woman

296
00:24:44,705 --> 00:24:47,743
Kuhio is scarier

297
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:52,680
Looked through me
just after a while

298
00:24:57,617 --> 00:24:59,494
Everyone said that too right

299
00:24:59,486 --> 00:25:00,658
Ms. Michiko

300
00:25:01,722 --> 00:25:06,762
Said that you
really love this job

301
00:25:07,661 --> 00:25:09,732
Because you're
good in socializing

302
00:25:09,763 --> 00:25:12,607
very confident and strong

303
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,543
I'm impressed

304
00:25:15,635 --> 00:25:16,739
I'm very strong too

305
00:25:16,737 --> 00:25:19,741
we can be good partners

306
00:25:27,614 --> 00:25:28,649
Cheers

307
00:25:36,656 --> 00:25:37,657
Thank you

308
00:25:37,758 --> 00:25:39,499
Oh thank you for the hard work

309
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:47,668

317

Its important to do lunchboxes

318
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,510
as important as world peace

319
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:39,554
I like the ocean
that I see beside you

320
00:26:50,764 --> 00:26:52,573

You can go back earlier today

324
00:27:05,745 --> 00:27:09,750
Oh then I'm hanging up

325
00:28:00,767 --> 00:28:03,714
This is really
small is it a real prawn

326
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,511
Who are you

327
00:28:07,607 --> 00:28:12,579
Oh Mr. Tatsuno long time no see

328
00:28:13,613 --> 00:28:14,648

329
00:28:15,782 --> 00:28:16,760
Where's the boss

330
00:28:18,518 --> 00:28:20,498
Looks like he gone out

331
00:28:21,655 --> 00:28:22,690
Then I'll be waiting

332
00:28:23,757 --> 00:28:29,503

333
00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:34,569
maybe they'll
come back tomorrow

334
00:28:34,668 --> 00:28:35,669
Where did you go

335
00:29:58,752 --> 00:30:00,527
Do you know what is this

336
00:30:01,688 --> 00:30:03,668
When you're in danger

337
00:30:03,657 --> 00:30:06,604
Lock on your target

338
00:30:06,593 --> 00:30:08,504
and reflect the sun

339
00:30:08,595 --> 00:30:09,699
Then you can
tell your own location

340
00:30:09,696 --> 00:30:11,505
to the helicopter

341
00:30:11,564 --> 00:30:13,544
It can transfer up to 160 km

342
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:15,638
its our life saver to us

343
00:30:16,703 --> 00:30:17,704
O

and light in the class

346
00:30:23,677 --> 00:30:25,588

348
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:33,754

357
00:32:28,568 --> 00:32:31,515
The rest give it

358
00:32:32,539 --> 00:32:33,540
Have you heard about it

00:32:33,773 --> 00:32:35,684

370
00:33:55,622 --> 00:33:56,692
Its not for you

371
00:33:58,691 --> 00:34:00,637
Who did you go with your lover'?

372
00:34:03,496 --> 00:34:04,702
Don't you say yes

373
00:34:04,731 --> 00:34:07,610
keep saying world
peace or whatsoever

374
00:34:08,501 --> 00:34:09,571
That person is alright

375
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:13,774

380
00:34:25,752 --> 00:34:27,561
How many times you made me cry

381
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:28,657
and still you dare say it

382
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:30,758
Helped you to
clear your property debt

383
00:34:30,757 --> 00:34:32,532

384
00:34:32,725 --> 00:34:33,726
This time you visit me

385
00:34:33,726 --> 00:34:35,535
for similar reasons right

386
00:34:35,562 --> 00:34:36,563
I tell you this

387
00:34:36,596 --> 00:34:38,701
I will not give
you a single cent

388
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:42,480
Its not property debt its goods

389
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:44,571
Although its bad but
I'll give you back soon

390
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:45,708
I'll work and return it to you

391
00:34:45,738 --> 00:34:47,547
Its useless for
you to say anything

392
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,747
Why did he fetch sister

393
00:34:52,779 --> 00:34:55,521
that man doesn't have a car

394
00:34:55,682 --> 00:34:57,628
What do you know

395
00:34:58,518 --> 00:35:01,624
As a spy don't even
want to drive on a rest day

396
00:35:01,654 --> 00:35:02,632
Is it a SPY

397
00:35:03,523 --> 00:35:04,558
Not I'm not

398
00:35:04,557 --> 00:35:07,538
plus its not rest day

399
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,733
He's doing some special job

400
00:35:09,729 --> 00:35:11,572
I'm helping him

401
00:35:11,598 --> 00:35:12,633
Special job is?

402
00:35:13,499 --> 00:35:15,604
If I can tell you its
not troublesome anymore

403
00:35:15,768 --> 00:35:19,614
Its secret secret mission

404
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,679
Mission what
does that person do

405
00:35:42,729 --> 00:35:45,608
That person is the
first person in this place

406
00:35:46,532 --> 00:35:47,567
I can see that

407
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,773
With Ms. Maria

408
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:51,715
the salary is
different too right

409
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:55,620
Ms. Michiko there's Mr. Tajima

410
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:58,621
Everyone is thinking whether
she's the mistress or not

411
00:36:09,789 --> 00:36:11,700

416
00:36:29,575 --> 00:36:30,713
Can you come over and talk now

417
00:36:32,512 --> 00:36:33,616
Its not that convenient now

418
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:36,626
Its good news to Ms. Michiko

419
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,613
What are you
talking about don't do this

420
00:36:56,636 --> 00:36:59,515
Ms. Michiko will
put the blame on me

421
00:37:15,621 --> 00:37:16,599
That day asked
you to accompany me

422
00:37:16,622 --> 00:37:18,499

423
00:37:18,558 --> 00:37:19,559

427
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:29,772
Oh I feel its too troublesome

428
00:37:30,803 --> 00:37:35,582
Oh what about that American

429
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:36,709
Sergeant?

430
00:37:36,743 --> 00:37:37,778
Is a good man right

431
00:37:38,544 --> 00:37:39,522
It's a weirdo

432
00:37:39,545 --> 00:37:40,649
suddenly he'll do sit up

433
00:37:40,747 --> 00:37:43,694
Maybe because
he's from the natives

434
00:37:44,584 --> 00:37:45,562
I'm looking at

435
00:37:45,585 --> 00:37:46,563
"taxidermy" will
definitely be very excited

436
00:37:46,586 --> 00:37:47,564
(In order to conserve the
birds' most original species

437
00:37:47,587 --> 00:37:48,565
permanent animal specimens)

438
00:37:48,654 --> 00:37:49,632

with the natives

441
00:37:52,692 --> 00:37:54,603
Only happiness

442
00:38:01,601 --> 00:38:02,773
No need to find anymore

443
00:38:21,587 --> 00:38:25,694
(Stop the night
flying training immediately)

444
00:39:43,603 --> 00:39:44,638
hello you can hear me

445
00:39:45,538 --> 00:39:46,608
Now I'm in Israel's sky

446
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:48,582
In the pilot room

447
00:39:48,774 --> 00:39:51,550
Now we're locking
Saddam's resident as a target

448
00:39:52,612 --> 00:39:53,682
When you go back to Japan

449
00:39:53,713 --> 00:39:55,715
there's a very important war

450
00:39:56,549 --> 00:39:58,756
So you can to prepare the four
wheel drive when you go back

451
00:39:58,784 --> 00:40:00,525
Four wheel drive?

452
00:40:02,555 --> 00:40:03,533
Wait

453
00:40:03,556 --> 00:40:04,557

454
00:40:05,725 --> 00:40:07,705
You're dating
with my sister right

455
00:40:08,761 --> 00:40:10,638
Your Japanese is
very fluent right

456
00:40:10,763 --> 00:40:12,504
Heard that you're an American'?

457
00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:16,602
Hey

458
00:40:17,536 --> 00:40:18,606
Are you listening

459
00:40:19,605 --> 00:40:21,642
My English is not bad right

460
00:40:22,642 --> 00:40:24,644
Last time Suga learn English

461
00:40:24,677 --> 00:40:26,748

were in the marines

462
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:28,683
Of course she taught
me a lot of other things

463
00:40:28,714 --> 00:40:30,660
other than English

464
00:40:30,683 --> 00:40:32,720
We can communicate in Japanese

465
00:40:32,718 --> 00:40:33,696
no problem

466
00:40:38,758 --> 00:40:40,533

469
00:40:45,665 --> 00:40:47,508
No I will not kill you

470
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:49,603
Its "Don't kill me" right

471
00:41:17,596 --> 00:41:18,597

472
00:41:23,569 --> 00:41:25,742

ordered please call me

473
00:41:39,585 --> 00:41:40,586

the shop you'll first

other party has come or not

476
00:41:46,525 --> 00:41:47,560
I changed to this table

477
00:41:47,593 --> 00:41:48,799

478
00:41:55,801 --> 00:41:57,678

Sorry to let you wait

480
00:42:16,722 --> 00:42:19,532
Royalty? Royal blood'?

481
00:42:24,597 --> 00:42:25,735
My sister is not an idiot

482
00:42:26,766 --> 00:42:30,509
But parents died
when we were young

483
00:42:31,504 --> 00:42:32,642
Have to work
really hard to earn money

484
00:42:32,671 --> 00:42:34,651
to keep me the
useless brother alive

485
00:42:35,574 --> 00:42:37,747
So I haven't' been in
any relationships before

486
00:42:39,512 --> 00:42:40,513
Just like this

00:42:42,782 --> 00:42:46,594

517
00:44:32,491 --> 00:44:33,492

Just call and confirm

525
00:46:02,681 --> 00:46:03,682
who's on the other side

526
00:46:04,717 --> 00:46:05,718
Plus

527
00:46:06,619 --> 00:46:07,620
Are you trying to ask

528
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,600

sis and give it back to me

529
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:11,563

530
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,737

00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,603
sister's money is my money

532
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:18,734
You get it from the other woman

533
00:46:19,498 --> 00:46:20,499
You can get it from
the other woman right

534
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:23,738
I know it's a
bit difficult for you

535
00:46:25,571 --> 00:46:27,778
Just like this can you put

536
00:46:37,783 --> 00:46:39,763
Who called just now

537
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:41,691
Oh my ex-girlfriend

538
00:46:42,788 --> 00:46:44,563
Too naive

539
00:47:25,597 --> 00:47:26,598
Welcome

540
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,557
The voice is really nice

541
00:47:53,592 --> 00:47:56,539
Have you heard of
Queen Elizabeth before

542
00:47:56,762 --> 00:47:58,503
Yes of course

543
00:47:58,797 --> 00:48:01,641
My mom is Queen Elizabeth

544
00:48:01,633 --> 00:48:02,703
sister's husband

545
00:48:02,735 --> 00:48:05,614
Which means its
her sister-in-law

546
00:48:05,738 --> 00:48:08,514
Really impressive

547
00:48:08,607 --> 00:48:09,585
There's a social
circle that is only available

548
00:48:09,608 --> 00:48:10,586
to the royal blood

549
00:48:10,642 --> 00:48:11,780
Although that social circle's

550
00:48:11,777 --> 00:48:14,519
existence is unknown

551
00:48:15,547 --> 00:48:16,719
Yes..a circle
with a lot of people

552
00:48:16,715 --> 00:48:18,490
Then everyone does investments

553
00:48:18,517 --> 00:48:19,495
such circle

554
00:48:19,752 --> 00:48:21,663
The participants are all VIP

555
00:48:21,687 --> 00:48:22,688
so they're able to obtain

556
00:48:22,688 --> 00:48:25,567
Information that are
not available to outsiders

557
00:48:25,691 --> 00:48:28,501
All in all they
will not let the

558
00:48:28,527 --> 00:48:31,565
royal members make any losses

559
00:48:35,734 --> 00:48:36,769
Ms. Michiko

560
00:48:37,669 --> 00:48:39,774
You should participate too

561
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:42,585
Partner with me

562
00:48:43,609 --> 00:48:44,644
Partner with you'?

563
00:48:45,744 --> 00:48:47,587
But first you have to hand in

564
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:49,559
deposit of
fifty thousands pounds

565
00:48:49,581 --> 00:48:51,686
Convert into yen
is around ten million

566
00:48:51,717 --> 00:48:52,718
But the money will double up

567
00:48:52,751 --> 00:48:54,731
really fast and
return it back to you

568
00:48:56,688 --> 00:48:59,601
Oh but I don't
have so much money

569
00:48:59,725 --> 00:49:01,762
If I'm the one
who introduce you in

570
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,706
you have to pay
thirty thousands only

571
00:49:03,762 --> 00:49:06,538
No twenty five thousands

572
00:49:06,565 --> 00:49:07,600
shouldn't be a problem

573
00:49:11,703 --> 00:49:12,738
Oh really sorry

574
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:16,645
Sounds like I really

575
00:49:16,675 --> 00:49:19,554
want to earn money like that

576
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,523
Its not like that

577
00:49:23,682 --> 00:49:24,660
What I said just now is to

578
00:49:24,683 --> 00:49:25,718
COVE!' Up my nervousness

579
00:49:26,585 --> 00:49:29,532
I'll feel
embarrass to say it directly

580
00:49:30,789 --> 00:49:33,565
Actually what I want to say is

581
00:49:33,559 --> 00:49:34,663
please partner up with me

582
00:49:38,697 --> 00:49:40,506
Come to think
of it I don't even

583
00:49:40,532 --> 00:49:42,569
care whether I
can make money or not

584
00:49:42,668 --> 00:49:45,615
Just like what Michiko knows

585
00:49:45,604 --> 00:49:46,742
antics are costly

586
00:49:46,772 --> 00:49:48,547
That's why I starred doing that

587
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:51,619
Plus depending on
the insider information

588
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:53,487
The money you earned is always

589
00:49:53,512 --> 00:49:55,651
more than what you expected

590
00:49:57,783 --> 00:50:00,559
Then can you please help me

591
00:50:00,552 --> 00:50:02,725
fill the money up

592
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:09,606
Actually I want to
be independent myself

593
00:50:10,596 --> 00:50:11,631
But the money I need to spend

594
00:50:11,663 --> 00:50:13,609
seems to be more than expected

595
00:50:14,566 --> 00:50:15,601
An outsider's opinion

596
00:50:15,601 --> 00:50:17,581
will normally decide
the success or failure

597
00:50:17,603 --> 00:50:18,673
Even if it's a vase

598
00:50:18,704 --> 00:50:20,650
The money spent to decorate
is cannot be taken lightly

599
00:50:23,742 --> 00:50:25,688
Ha-ha excuse me

600
00:50:25,711 --> 00:50:28,590
I'm being rude

601
00:50:28,714 --> 00:50:30,660
I don't feel
anything rude about it

602
00:50:31,717 --> 00:50:34,789
I really like to work

603
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:37,701
Just like what Mr. Kuhio says

604
00:50:41,593 --> 00:50:43,766
Understood me as your partner

605
00:50:43,795 --> 00:50:47,538
will support you Ms. Michiko

606
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:49,739
You can't be my partner

607
00:50:50,569 --> 00:50:51,741
Because I'm already married

608
00:50:53,672 --> 00:50:54,707
But still I'm very happy

609
00:50:56,642 --> 00:50:58,644
I'm really happy too

610
00:50:58,777 --> 00:51:01,690
Hahaha I lied to you

611
00:51:01,747 --> 00:51:04,489
I'm not married

612
00:51:59,605 --> 00:52:00,640
Welcome

613
00:52:50,589 --> 00:52:54,560
Guest this guest...

614
00:53:37,736 --> 00:53:38,806
Stop

615
00:53:41,573 --> 00:53:42,608
Go towards the right

616
00:53:44,776 --> 00:53:45,777
Yes over there

617
00:53:50,782 --> 00:53:51,760
Wind

618
00:54:17,542 --> 00:54:19,715
Rika is off today

619
00:54:21,747 --> 00:54:24,557
I came to find you

620
00:54:29,755 --> 00:54:31,735
Rika is a good girl

621
00:54:32,557 --> 00:54:33,627
Someone who can
communicate very well

622
00:54:34,659 --> 00:54:36,536
Ms. Rika I don't know

623
00:54:36,528 --> 00:54:38,667
why I'm more afraid

624
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:39,731
Afraid?

625
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,772
Why are you afraid

626
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:45,782
I finally understand
after I think for a while

627
00:54:47,506 --> 00:54:48,507
Ms. Haru

628
00:54:49,574 --> 00:54:52,612
I like you

629
00:55:00,619 --> 00:55:02,530
Consider it as
love at first sight

630
00:55:03,522 --> 00:55:05,502
Actually I thought
there's no such thing

631
00:55:05,524 --> 00:55:07,765
as love as first sight

632
00:55:08,727 --> 00:55:10,502
All the while I feel
those who fell in love

633
00:55:10,495 --> 00:55:12,475
at first sight are fools

634
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:14,573
Come to think of it

635
00:55:14,566 --> 00:55:16,671
maybe I've become one too

636
00:55:17,669 --> 00:55:21,481
But I feel really happy

637
00:55:24,643 --> 00:55:26,714
That mistress is happy too

638
00:55:29,614 --> 00:55:33,494
I want to date
you seriously can

639
00:55:36,755 --> 00:55:38,496
sorry

640
00:55:39,758 --> 00:55:41,669
You have a boy friend'?

641
00:55:43,595 --> 00:55:44,699
Its not like that

642
00:55:44,729 --> 00:55:45,730
Why don't you accept me

643
00:55:47,732 --> 00:55:51,509
I'm just a nobody sorry

644
00:55:51,503 --> 00:55:52,504
Wait

645
00:55:52,637 --> 00:55:53,638
Ms. Haru did something happen

646
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,541
Nothing

647
00:55:56,575 --> 00:55:57,645
We're chatting about some

648
00:55:57,676 --> 00:55:59,587
private matters

649
00:55:59,744 --> 00:56:01,724
Private matters

650
00:56:01,713 --> 00:56:06,526
its working hours now

651
00:56:06,718 --> 00:56:07,696
You as a U.S army

652
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:08,720
is that free

653
00:56:09,621 --> 00:56:10,691
Aren't you in war right now

654
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:12,725
You think that
with that uniform

655
00:56:12,757 --> 00:56:14,566
all the
Japanese will respect you

656
00:56:14,593 --> 00:56:15,594
Mr. Takahashi

657
00:56:15,727 --> 00:56:17,536
I told you this place

658
00:56:17,529 --> 00:56:19,509
is a place to
keep living things

659
00:56:19,764 --> 00:56:21,607
Who do you think you are

660
00:56:22,567 --> 00:56:23,739
Plus have you really care about

661
00:56:23,768 --> 00:56:25,577
the children before

662
00:56:26,771 --> 00:56:28,478
Let's go

663
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,780
Do you have kids

664
00:56:31,509 --> 00:56:32,510
Kids

665
00:56:33,712 --> 00:56:34,690
Now not

666
00:56:34,713 --> 00:56:36,693
but in the
future I'll have many

667
00:56:37,515 --> 00:56:39,791
Protecting the kids is
our responsibility right

668
00:56:41,753 --> 00:56:43,562
So that's the
reason we have war right

669
00:56:45,624 --> 00:56:46,762
If war was a good or bad thing

670
00:56:47,525 --> 00:56:48,663
Definitely that's a bad thing

671
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,501
But doesn't matter
whether it's a good or bad thing

672
00:56:50,495 --> 00:56:51,565
whatever needs to
happen has to happen

673
00:56:51,796 --> 00:56:53,571
That's the reason why we exist

674
00:56:53,565 --> 00:56:54,566
In order to
protect your own country

675
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:55,737
You didn't even put
a tiny bit of effort

676
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,747
What do you
understand as a Japanese

677
00:57:01,573 --> 00:57:03,678
It happened last year

678
00:57:03,675 --> 00:57:05,677
my brothers died

679
00:57:06,778 --> 00:57:08,689
He's the partner in charged

680
00:57:08,713 --> 00:57:10,750
good friend of many years

681
00:57:11,783 --> 00:57:12,761
That day

682
00:57:12,784 --> 00:57:15,765
we were flying as usual

683
00:57:16,521 --> 00:57:17,659
Fighting to
death with our enemies

684
00:57:18,523 --> 00:57:19,501
But

685
00:57:19,524 --> 00:57:20,594
that time we wanted to
escape from enemy's attack

686
00:57:20,625 --> 00:57:22,536
When we were getting
ready to attack the enemy

687
00:57:22,627 --> 00:57:24,629
Suddenly the oxygen was cutoff

688
00:57:24,629 --> 00:57:25,699
The generator stopped too

689
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:27,710
everything went out of control

690
00:57:27,766 --> 00:57:30,576
I want to save
him but that time

691
00:57:30,602 --> 00:57:34,550
the plane was
starting to crack up

692
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:36,676
His neck bone

693
00:57:36,708 --> 00:57:40,713
was hit by the
mirror that crashed

694
00:57:40,745 --> 00:57:42,554
The body was gone

695
00:57:44,616 --> 00:57:46,721
Don't you have any friend

696
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,729
Really sorry Mr. Kuhio

697
00:57:47,786 --> 00:57:49,493
Japanese!!

698
00:57:51,723 --> 00:57:53,532
Japanese!!!

699
00:58:05,537 --> 00:58:06,777
Don't point fingers at people

700
00:58:15,613 --> 00:58:16,751
What about that pilot

701
00:58:22,721 --> 00:58:23,722
Not really clear

702
00:59:26,751 --> 00:59:28,492
Take the umbrella

703
00:59:30,488 --> 00:59:31,489
Oh nothing

704
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:32,567
Oh so this is it

705
01:00:14,666 --> 01:00:15,770
Ms. Nagano Nin No.7

706
01:00:19,637 --> 01:00:23,585
Thank you for waiting thank you

707
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,525
Why are you here

708
01:00:36,654 --> 01:00:39,567
I asked the
administration to help me check

709
01:00:40,725 --> 01:00:42,671
Your phone is alright

710
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,543
Look at this

711
01:00:51,769 --> 01:00:54,545
The designing draft is here

712
01:00:55,707 --> 01:00:59,484
Asked what kind of
materials do you like

713
01:00:59,777 --> 01:01:02,485
Of course those two type
were chosen by Mr. Kabaku

714
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:03,752
Its not bad

715
01:01:04,716 --> 01:01:06,662
Asked us to reply
as soon as possible

716
01:01:06,651 --> 01:01:08,722
I personally feel its not bad

717
01:01:19,664 --> 01:01:20,699
Chosen that

718
01:01:32,777 --> 01:01:35,656
Although its really not bad

719
01:01:40,752 --> 01:01:43,699
Then this one

720
01:01:43,721 --> 01:01:45,598
This is correct right

721
01:01:45,657 --> 01:01:49,628
But you have to pay
the deposit when you reply

722
01:01:49,694 --> 01:01:51,696
Can you gather 10 million now

723
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:00,709
Looks like you're
poorer than I thought

724
01:02:01,573 --> 01:02:04,577
Because we open up a new shop

725
01:02:05,643 --> 01:02:07,589
But still its around 10 million

726
01:02:07,579 --> 01:02:08,580
Oh that one is

727
01:02:09,514 --> 01:02:10,515
Then you can only cancel it

728
01:02:10,782 --> 01:02:12,591
Then you have to give up

729
01:02:14,619 --> 01:02:15,689
Its not that

730
01:02:21,693 --> 01:02:25,607
I know I'll go and get it now

731
01:02:50,788 --> 01:02:53,701
Good evening I'm Michiko

732
01:03:00,565 --> 01:03:04,513
Mr. Kuhio please
don't come to Ginza anymore

733
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:06,537
Why

734
01:03:07,672 --> 01:03:09,743
Because I don't want
to see you in the shop

735
01:03:10,708 --> 01:03:13,587
If you want to meet privately

736
01:03:16,748 --> 01:03:18,750
I found a really nice a partner

737
01:03:19,584 --> 01:03:20,756
Those troublesome procedures

738
01:03:20,752 --> 01:03:22,754
I'll go and get it done

739
01:03:23,788 --> 01:03:26,530
They asked me to
sign the contract fast

740
01:03:26,524 --> 01:03:28,561
because the
house is high in demand

741
01:03:29,627 --> 01:03:35,634
You need another sum of
money to bail yourself out right

742
01:03:36,634 --> 01:03:37,704
Looks like it

743
01:03:39,637 --> 01:03:42,709
How come I feel that I'm conned

744
01:03:44,776 --> 01:03:46,619
When I was asked

745
01:03:46,644 --> 01:03:49,648
I feel that the woman in
Ginza will answer like that

746
01:03:50,782 --> 01:03:53,592
There isn't lies or so

747
01:03:53,584 --> 01:03:56,758
just doing what you hope for

748
01:03:59,691 --> 01:04:05,539
What is money to you right

749
01:04:16,674 --> 01:04:17,744
Go to the washroom

750
01:04:31,522 --> 01:04:33,627
We're from the police station

751
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:36,502
Want to ask about your customer

752
01:04:36,527 --> 01:04:39,599
Tajima Ryuuji

753
01:04:39,697 --> 01:04:41,506
What happen to Mr. Tajima

754
01:04:41,632 --> 01:04:42,633
Didn't you watch the news

755
01:04:43,634 --> 01:04:45,671
Got arrested in the
work place this morning

756
01:04:46,571 --> 01:04:47,549
Really

757
01:04:47,772 --> 01:04:49,547
1 billion and 300 million

758
01:04:49,774 --> 01:04:51,481
1 billion?

759
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,557
Come to think of it

760
01:04:57,582 --> 01:05:00,563
his money is not clean

761
01:05:00,585 --> 01:05:01,620
Is it accomplice

762
01:05:01,719 --> 01:05:05,724
Accomplice?
Don't get me involve

763
01:05:07,558 --> 01:05:08,764
That we'll investigate

764
01:05:33,651 --> 01:05:35,653
All of you are detectives right

765
01:05:37,555 --> 01:05:38,727
Let all the fools go

766
01:05:39,624 --> 01:05:41,535
Fools'? Who

767
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,576
The error in the spellings

768
01:05:51,569 --> 01:05:55,517
didn't the other
victims make a report

769
01:06:01,712 --> 01:06:03,589
That's Kuhio

770
01:06:04,549 --> 01:06:05,550
Kuhio?

771
01:06:05,583 --> 01:06:07,585
The Kuhio who con
people in marriage

772
01:06:07,785 --> 01:06:09,628
Now its Sergeant

773
01:06:11,756 --> 01:06:13,497
Are you laughing

774
01:06:14,625 --> 01:06:20,735
Its nonsense really nonsense

775
01:06:27,538 --> 01:06:28,539
Coke

776
01:06:28,606 --> 01:06:29,607
Ok

777
01:06:32,777 --> 01:06:34,620
You did it on
purpose didn't you

778
01:06:34,745 --> 01:06:36,486
When did you arrive

779
01:06:48,526 --> 01:06:49,561
What's this

780
01:06:49,694 --> 01:06:53,574
Convert into 1 O
million its around

781
01:06:53,731 --> 01:06:56,541
Why is it so troublesome

782
01:06:56,634 --> 01:06:57,704
Please put it to good use

783
01:07:00,805 --> 01:07:03,581
How much is one U.S. dollar now

784
01:07:04,675 --> 01:07:07,656
I don't want to
get near you anymore

785
01:07:07,645 --> 01:07:09,522
and cause trouble

786
01:07:10,515 --> 01:07:12,722
Don't misunderstand its not that
I want both of you to break up

787
01:07:13,684 --> 01:07:14,685
Plus the money
you took from sister

788
01:07:14,685 --> 01:07:16,494
is not so little right

789
01:07:16,654 --> 01:07:19,533
I didn't cheat her

790
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:37,745
You have to treasure it

791
01:07:37,775 --> 01:07:42,622
her hard earned money

792
01:07:43,514 --> 01:07:49,658
You can con it
from the wine server

793
01:07:52,657 --> 01:07:53,761
Prepare the money for me

794
01:07:53,791 --> 01:07:55,702
I'll contact you
as soon as possible

795
01:08:36,567 --> 01:08:37,739
My name is Senoka haru

796
01:08:39,503 --> 01:08:40,573
Ms. Haru

797
01:08:43,574 --> 01:08:44,712
From the kids

798
01:08:44,709 --> 01:08:46,689
I took back your mirror

799
01:08:47,511 --> 01:08:48,785
I'll take and
give it back to you

800
01:08:49,513 --> 01:08:50,583
Your base right

801
01:08:51,582 --> 01:08:52,652
But now

802
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:55,654
we're doing some
emergency training

803
01:08:55,686 --> 01:08:58,565
Its not good if he comes in

804
01:08:58,589 --> 01:08:59,659
Better for me to go back

805
01:08:59,757 --> 01:09:03,534
Oh really sorry

806
01:09:03,527 --> 01:09:06,531
and I apologize for last time

807
01:09:06,697 --> 01:09:07,675
Nothing

808
01:09:08,633 --> 01:09:10,544
Then I'll be more
than happy to follow

809
01:09:13,537 --> 01:09:14,515
Hello'?

810
01:09:27,785 --> 01:09:29,526
Find me

811
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:34,565
We can't accept this

812
01:09:35,693 --> 01:09:37,673
You know all of us are

813
01:09:37,662 --> 01:09:39,767
working really hard

814
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:43,677
But you said you
can't pay us any salary

815
01:09:43,701 --> 01:09:45,544
what's going on

816
01:09:47,738 --> 01:09:50,548
Really sorry everyone

817
01:10:25,543 --> 01:10:26,681
You're alone today

818
01:11:13,724 --> 01:11:16,671
Its not like that

819
01:11:16,694 --> 01:11:17,695
What do you mean
its not like that

820
01:11:18,662 --> 01:11:20,539
Kissed and touched before right

821
01:11:26,704 --> 01:11:27,682
Aren't you angry

822
01:11:28,539 --> 01:11:29,677
There's nothing
to be angry about

823
01:11:30,741 --> 01:11:32,743
Your lover and your
friends did such thing

824
01:11:33,544 --> 01:11:34,614
But we're not lovers anymore

825
01:11:34,645 --> 01:11:35,623
it has nothing to do with me

826
01:11:37,548 --> 01:11:38,549
So sly

827
01:11:39,517 --> 01:11:40,689
Sly? Why

828
01:11:41,719 --> 01:11:42,697
You should know

829
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,495
I like Mr. Shinagawa

830
01:11:45,556 --> 01:11:46,557
You like him'?

831
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:47,591
Don't you know

832
01:11:47,691 --> 01:11:48,692
I really didn't know

833
01:11:48,726 --> 01:11:50,637
Then get angry now

834
01:11:50,694 --> 01:11:52,537
Alright don't be so loud

835
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:53,770
you'll disturb other people

836
01:11:53,798 --> 01:11:55,505
Shut up

837
01:11:55,733 --> 01:11:57,576
You decide to
really just leave like that

838
01:11:59,737 --> 01:12:00,715
Haru

839
01:12:00,738 --> 01:12:04,550
although it's a bit
weird to say such thing now

840
01:12:04,675 --> 01:12:05,653
But still I feel that

841
01:12:05,676 --> 01:12:06,654
American is suspicious

842
01:12:07,545 --> 01:12:08,523
You better be careful

843
01:12:08,779 --> 01:12:10,588
I told you it has
nothing to do with you

844
01:12:48,586 --> 01:12:49,656
Am I really sly

845
01:12:54,692 --> 01:12:56,467
Excuse me

846
01:12:56,493 --> 01:12:58,769
to say something
that doesn't make sense

847
01:12:59,496 --> 01:13:04,570
No Ms. Haru is not sly

848
01:14:27,785 --> 01:14:29,628
The hunters

849
01:14:33,657 --> 01:14:34,692
Nothing

850
01:14:45,636 --> 01:14:48,515
Have you been to Hawaii

851
01:14:50,741 --> 01:14:55,747
Then let's go next time
for the blue sky and ocean

852
01:14:56,714 --> 01:14:58,557
Friends are not bad too

853
01:14:58,549 --> 01:15:00,722
and I want to
introduce you to my parents

854
01:15:01,785 --> 01:15:03,765
Your parents are in Hawaii?

855
01:15:05,556 --> 01:15:08,560
They bought a
house after they retire

856
01:15:08,592 --> 01:15:10,629
and they have barbeque everyday

857
01:15:11,729 --> 01:15:12,730
Looks fun

858
01:15:15,566 --> 01:15:19,571
Although both of us
can be really happy too

859
01:15:23,674 --> 01:15:24,652
Haru

860
01:15:24,675 --> 01:15:27,747
we're working for world peace

861
01:15:27,778 --> 01:15:30,759
Of course I am proud of this

862
01:15:31,615 --> 01:15:34,721
But still I get
misunderstood at times

863
01:15:34,752 --> 01:15:39,565
Just like last time in
order to fulfill my dreams

864
01:15:39,556 --> 01:15:42,765
sacrifices are necessary

865
01:15:43,694 --> 01:15:46,538
When we attacked and
thought about the kids

866
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:48,737
who lost their parents

867
01:15:48,799 --> 01:15:50,779
We get emotional

868
01:15:52,536 --> 01:15:54,641
Last time the
friend I mentioned

869
01:15:54,671 --> 01:15:56,548
he has a young child

870
01:15:56,673 --> 01:15:59,586
Enemy or friends
it doesn't matter

871
01:15:59,643 --> 01:16:00,747
Just that nobody
can take away the right

872
01:16:00,744 --> 01:16:03,486
of the children to
have their parents with them

873
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:05,560
So I discussed with my friend

874
01:16:05,549 --> 01:16:07,551
Must prepare a trust fund

875
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,689
for the children's future

876
01:16:09,553 --> 01:16:10,725
Not only those
American children

877
01:16:10,721 --> 01:16:12,496
but also the kids from Iraq

878
01:16:12,523 --> 01:16:13,695
Kids from all over the world

879
01:16:14,558 --> 01:16:16,731
Wants to get
Japanese's help too

880
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:21,737
Haru let's do this together

881
01:16:22,733 --> 01:16:25,612
Actually I told Ms. Rika

882
01:16:25,636 --> 01:16:26,671
but regretfully

883
01:16:26,703 --> 01:16:28,683
She couldn't understand

884
01:16:31,708 --> 01:16:35,656
Because I have a
really low salary

885
01:16:35,712 --> 01:16:38,716
Thank you the most
important thing is the heart

886
01:16:39,616 --> 01:16:41,721
Indeed Haru
understands me the most

887
01:16:46,623 --> 01:16:48,500
Really happy to be able to help

888
01:16:49,493 --> 01:16:51,598
What time do you
finish work tomorrow

889
01:16:54,731 --> 01:16:58,770
I resigned today

890
01:17:00,704 --> 01:17:03,685
Why its quite a good job

891
01:17:04,575 --> 01:17:05,679
Its really
suitable for Ms. Haru

892
01:17:05,709 --> 01:17:06,710
what a waste

893
01:17:07,644 --> 01:17:08,748
Its better to continue right

894
01:17:34,671 --> 01:17:38,585
Oh you're back

895
01:17:43,514 --> 01:17:45,755
The mission came
suddenly in midnight

896
01:17:45,782 --> 01:17:48,524
couldn't contact you

897
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:53,566
You're worried
about my job thank you

898
01:17:53,757 --> 01:17:55,703
Nothing compare with lunchbox

899
01:17:55,726 --> 01:17:57,797
world peace is more important

900
01:18:04,801 --> 01:18:08,749
I slipped when I
was passed the forest

901
01:18:10,707 --> 01:18:16,487
There're still mission
today you can go back first

902
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:17,715
Nothing

903
01:18:18,715 --> 01:18:21,559
Its very late too

904
01:18:22,586 --> 01:18:24,657
I'll prepare the
meals and wait for you

905
01:18:26,557 --> 01:18:30,528
Oh depending on you then

906
01:20:01,585 --> 01:20:02,689
Good afternoon

907
01:21:00,544 --> 01:21:01,522
Just go in

908
01:21:01,578 --> 01:21:02,750
Leave me alone I'm
waiting for somebody

909
01:21:03,513 --> 01:21:04,583
Go and work

910
01:21:05,549 --> 01:21:06,653
Didn't you say you
don't want to work anymore

911
01:21:13,623 --> 01:21:15,500
Hey since yesterday

912
01:21:15,525 --> 01:21:16,799
I didn't eat anything

913
01:21:43,587 --> 01:21:45,567
Will it taste
better if we eat together

914
01:21:58,502 --> 01:21:59,606
Going to the beach

915
01:22:00,804 --> 01:22:02,545
Beach'?

916
01:22:17,587 --> 01:22:19,567
What can you catch here

917
01:22:21,525 --> 01:22:22,595
Butterfish

918
01:22:24,561 --> 01:22:27,565
This fish has different colours

919
01:22:27,564 --> 01:22:28,702
under different environment

920
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,602
The color is light
when its in shallow place

921
01:22:32,636 --> 01:22:35,674
and it'll be darker
if its in deeper place

922
01:22:40,510 --> 01:22:42,683
The fish you
catch here is black

923
01:22:48,485 --> 01:22:49,657
Very deep right

924
01:22:50,787 --> 01:22:52,528
Yes

925
01:22:55,659 --> 01:22:59,607
I thought about dying
before because I'm too foolish

926
01:23:01,798 --> 01:23:03,505
But if I really die then
I'll really be foolish

927
01:23:03,533 --> 01:23:04,534
that why I didn't die

928
01:23:06,703 --> 01:23:09,684
What's wrong what happened

929
01:23:10,574 --> 01:23:11,609
This

930
01:23:20,584 --> 01:23:24,589
This is 2800 yen right

931
01:23:26,623 --> 01:23:27,761
The story about your
friend who passed away

932
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:29,634
you got it from the movie right

933
01:23:30,794 --> 01:23:31,772
Why do you say that

934
01:23:33,697 --> 01:23:35,506
Lately the jet fighters

935
01:23:35,499 --> 01:23:37,570
are able to emit air

936
01:23:37,634 --> 01:23:39,614
Its impossible for
that kind of thing to happen

937
01:23:39,736 --> 01:23:40,737
Do you know

938
01:23:41,605 --> 01:23:43,676
Ms. Haru you misunderstood

939
01:23:43,673 --> 01:23:45,482
the story is true

940
01:23:45,575 --> 01:23:47,680
My good friend McLuhan is true

941
01:23:47,677 --> 01:23:48,678
McLuhan'?

942
01:23:48,745 --> 01:23:49,746
Yes McLuhan

943
01:23:49,779 --> 01:23:51,725
Didn't you say
its Johnny last time

944
01:23:52,549 --> 01:23:54,529
You heard wrongly I think

945
01:23:54,551 --> 01:23:55,723
I said McLuhan

946
01:23:55,752 --> 01:23:58,494
Don't be stupid I
remember it clearly

947
01:23:58,555 --> 01:23:59,659
Because when I
was in kindergarten

948
01:23:59,689 --> 01:24:01,498
I name my dog Johnny

949
01:24:07,597 --> 01:24:11,511
Why did you find
me I don't have money

950
01:24:13,637 --> 01:24:15,514
Why is it me

951
01:24:22,612 --> 01:24:23,716
- Ms. Haru let go
- Why

952
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:25,521
It'll break It'll break

953
01:24:25,549 --> 01:24:26,584
Enough answer me

954
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:27,720
Why me

955
01:26:27,637 --> 01:26:28,615
Their accomplice?

956
01:26:31,574 --> 01:26:32,609
I have to be clear first

957
01:26:32,609 --> 01:26:34,611
I'm your savior

958
01:26:35,745 --> 01:26:37,486
Who are you

959
01:26:39,716 --> 01:26:41,753
How much did he cheat from you

960
01:26:48,491 --> 01:26:49,629
Everyone is really stupid

961
01:26:55,732 --> 01:26:59,578
Hey don't move

962
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:05,620
My sister said 2 hours

963
01:27:05,642 --> 01:27:10,614
whether to go to police
station or go home up to you

964
01:28:00,497 --> 01:28:02,568
Just like what
I keep telling you

965
01:28:02,565 --> 01:28:05,603
under the
restriction of law no.19

966
01:28:05,668 --> 01:28:07,511
Have to bear the responsibility
as a joint country

967
01:28:07,537 --> 01:28:10,711
Who wouldn't pay

968
01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:14,688
can you call this joint country
with this kind of relationship

969
01:28:14,744 --> 01:28:16,553
Its totally like
a sub-U.S company

970
01:28:16,713 --> 01:28:19,751
Its because of people like you

971
01:28:19,783 --> 01:28:20,761
that we got looked down

972
01:28:21,551 --> 01:28:22,529
First you have to declare our

973
01:28:22,552 --> 01:28:23,530
position to Japan clearly

974
01:28:23,653 --> 01:28:24,631
U.S. and the world

975
01:28:24,687 --> 01:28:26,530
How can we be so thick face

976
01:28:38,701 --> 01:28:41,477
Japan is really lonely

977
01:28:44,707 --> 01:28:51,625
Lonely more like
we're being ignored

978
01:28:53,483 --> 01:28:54,587
Didn't realise at all

979
01:28:54,617 --> 01:28:57,598
really sorry I
wouldn't be staying here anymore

980
01:29:02,625 --> 01:29:04,605
Thank you

981
01:29:05,728 --> 01:29:06,763
Yes its only

982
01:29:06,763 --> 01:29:10,575
but not bad for a place to die

983
01:29:13,603 --> 01:29:14,604
Let's die together

984
01:29:14,637 --> 01:29:17,550
it'll come true when we die

985
01:29:20,743 --> 01:29:25,743
What do you mean
its true initially

986
01:29:32,789 --> 01:29:38,740
Its true so want
to prove to everyone

987
01:29:41,531 --> 01:29:42,703
I don't understand

988
01:29:42,732 --> 01:29:44,473
Johansen. Elizabeth.

989
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:45,570
Kushio is not related

990
01:29:45,702 --> 01:29:47,704
Nothing to do with
the American pilot too

991
01:29:47,737 --> 01:29:52,550
I like the you in front of me

992
01:29:52,542 --> 01:29:54,749
just like this

993
01:30:06,556 --> 01:30:07,557
I know

994
01:30:54,537 --> 01:30:55,515
Die

995
01:31:00,743 --> 01:31:03,781
Can you allow me to be
stubborn for once before I die

996
01:31:05,782 --> 01:31:09,594
Let's eat the lunch
box in our shop together

997
01:31:11,688 --> 01:31:12,723
Now?

998
01:31:16,759 --> 01:31:18,500
Ok

999
01:31:59,769 --> 01:32:00,770
I'm eating now

1000
01:32:01,804 --> 01:32:03,613
Please

1001
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,535
Delicious

1002
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:27,503
Really

1003
01:32:27,563 --> 01:32:29,543
Delicious hamburger

1004
01:32:29,632 --> 01:32:31,612
Yes this is the most
popular order in the shop

1005
01:32:31,634 --> 01:32:33,705
Its uniquely set
up with egg yolk sauce

1006
01:32:34,537 --> 01:32:35,607
So it seems

1007
01:32:45,648 --> 01:32:46,718
I'm cold

1008
01:32:53,723 --> 01:32:56,636
Haru

1009
01:33:15,645 --> 01:33:17,591
Get out of the way

1010
01:33:41,604 --> 01:33:42,742
The last dinner

1011
01:33:44,774 --> 01:33:47,721
Yes the last dinner

1012
01:34:07,530 --> 01:34:12,775
I was born in Hokkaido

1013
01:34:12,802 --> 01:34:19,549
my house is big

1014
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:22,683
There're a lot of roses

1015
01:34:23,613 --> 01:34:26,651
The neighbours called
my house "Rose Garden"

1016
01:34:49,605 --> 01:34:52,745
Dad operates a few supermarkets

1017
01:34:52,775 --> 01:34:55,654
but he let other
people manage them

1018
01:34:56,612 --> 01:35:03,621
My parents are always
at home and play with me

1019
01:35:22,705 --> 01:35:26,517
You parents
thought you that too

1020
01:35:28,678 --> 01:35:33,718
All the while you're
sitting like that right

1021
01:35:35,685 --> 01:35:41,499
Yes indeed I was
told most of the time

1022
01:35:48,731 --> 01:35:50,642
Wait

1023
01:35:51,567 --> 01:35:52,568
What're you doing

1024
01:35:57,506 --> 01:35:58,576
So I said don't hit anymore

1025
01:35:58,641 --> 01:36:00,643
You don't care about it

1026
01:36:08,584 --> 01:36:09,756
After you enter the old house

1027
01:36:09,752 --> 01:36:12,494
the strongest
junior baseball team

1028
01:36:15,591 --> 01:36:17,662
Because I run fast that's
why I took the guarding position

1029
01:36:20,563 --> 01:36:22,543
But our pitcher is really good

1030
01:36:22,665 --> 01:36:24,736
So basically the ball
didn't come to my side

1031
01:36:26,569 --> 01:36:28,606
Because I'm really free that's
why I keep looking at the sky

1032
01:36:35,511 --> 01:36:37,616
That's why I like planes

1033
01:36:39,715 --> 01:36:40,716
After that...

1034
01:36:49,759 --> 01:36:54,708
After that I
underwent strict training

1035
01:36:56,499 --> 01:36:58,706
And became American's pilot

1036
01:37:00,770 --> 01:37:02,716
Until now

1037
01:37:02,705 --> 01:37:07,552
I fight for world peace

1038
01:37:34,537 --> 01:37:35,641
Really delicious

1039
01:37:39,608 --> 01:37:40,746
Then die

1040
01:37:47,516 --> 01:37:48,722
Who will die first

1041
01:37:52,521 --> 01:37:53,693
I won't shoot

1042
01:37:55,725 --> 01:37:56,760
That's right

1043
01:38:06,802 --> 01:38:08,713
You will not die like this

1044
01:38:10,606 --> 01:38:14,486
Its nothing my shooting is good

1045
01:38:15,778 --> 01:38:17,519
Close your eyes

1046
01:38:26,789 --> 01:38:28,632
Close your eyes!

1047
01:38:33,496 --> 01:38:35,476
But this is not
a real gun right

1048
01:38:39,535 --> 01:38:40,605
This is a real gun

1049
01:38:43,672 --> 01:38:45,515
I learn before

1050
01:38:46,542 --> 01:38:48,544
Learn a lot of things

1051
01:38:57,686 --> 01:38:59,563
Then what should I do

1052
01:39:00,790 --> 01:39:04,602
Nothing you'll die soon enough

1053
01:39:05,661 --> 01:39:06,639
Just now in the hamburger

1054
01:39:06,662 --> 01:39:07,732
I put some
poisonous mushroom inside

1055
01:39:09,532 --> 01:39:10,567
Although its just 200 grams

1056
01:39:17,673 --> 01:39:18,708
Found you

1057
01:39:24,713 --> 01:39:25,714
Wait

1058
01:39:37,726 --> 01:39:40,707
Let me go

1059
01:39:41,630 --> 01:39:42,700
Wait

1060
01:39:45,568 --> 01:39:48,708
I want to ask why
did he treat me this way

1061
01:39:48,771 --> 01:39:50,478
Its late

1062
01:39:50,573 --> 01:39:51,779
Since I'm dying soon

1063
01:39:52,541 --> 01:39:53,781
We ate poisonous mushroom

1064
01:39:55,611 --> 01:39:56,681
Did he really eat is

1065
01:39:56,779 --> 01:39:58,554
I ate it both of us ate it

1066
01:39:59,782 --> 01:40:02,729
You're too sly spit it out

1067
01:40:05,488 --> 01:40:08,560
Spit it out! Spit it out

1068
01:40:13,529 --> 01:40:15,702
That man ate with guilt

1069
01:40:16,499 --> 01:40:17,500
O

1070
01:40:17,633 --> 01:40:19,510
I cheated him and
asked him to eat it

1071
01:40:19,768 --> 01:40:21,577
Isn't that poisonous mushroom

1072
01:40:21,737 --> 01:40:22,715
Its really bitter

1073
01:40:22,738 --> 01:40:25,514
its impossible
that he'll eat it

1074
01:40:26,542 --> 01:40:27,646
You guys eat
normal mushroom right

1075
01:40:45,761 --> 01:40:48,537
Must be because

1076
01:40:54,637 --> 01:40:56,639
He really likes you

1077
01:40:59,675 --> 01:41:00,779
That's why he cheated me

1078
01:41:16,559 --> 01:41:20,632
So I don't understand

1079
01:42:28,530 --> 01:42:29,565
That's all

1080
01:42:56,759 --> 01:42:57,760
Are you an American

1081
01:43:06,769 --> 01:43:09,545
<i>Its Japanese sorry</i>

1082
01:43:25,721 --> 01:43:26,791
Are you Tom

1083
01:43:29,725 --> 01:43:30,760
What

1084
01:43:31,527 --> 01:43:32,733
You're Tom Watts

1085
01:43:35,531 --> 01:43:38,512
I'm Johansen. Elizabeth.

1086
01:43:38,534 --> 01:43:39,672
Kuhio

1087
01:43:39,768 --> 01:43:42,749
How many women did you
cheated using that name

1088
01:43:43,772 --> 01:43:44,773
I didn't cheat

1089
01:43:45,774 --> 01:43:47,651
They too are longing for it

1090
01:43:48,544 --> 01:43:51,548
I did what they want

1091
01:43:52,514 --> 01:43:54,687
Stop talking
using that kind of tone

1092
01:43:58,654 --> 01:43:59,689
Stand up

1093
01:44:01,757 --> 01:44:04,499
I want to give
you something special

1094
01:46:32,608 --> 01:46:34,208
(Kuhio)

1095
01:47:34,770 --> 01:47:36,647
Fellows

1096
01:47:36,738 --> 01:47:39,617
The first proposal

1097
01:47:39,775 --> 01:47:41,550
That's it

1098
01:47:41,576 --> 01:47:43,647
let's start on our next step

1099
01:47:43,712 --> 01:47:44,747
Understood

1100
01:47:45,781 --> 01:47:48,625
If you move forward
it's the enemy's base

1101
01:47:48,684 --> 01:47:52,530
Its difficult for battle

1102
01:47:52,621 --> 01:47:54,658
But the victory
will definitely be ours

1103
01:47:54,790 --> 01:47:55,768
I truly believe

1104
01:47:55,791 --> 01:47:57,498
fearless battle

1105
01:47:57,526 --> 01:47:58,561
Understood

1106
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:10,640
The last plane
stopped at Virginia

1107
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:15,517
Went over there with a F14

1108
01:48:15,610 --> 01:48:19,649
20 to 23 miles
away from enemy's base

1109
01:48:19,681 --> 01:48:21,627
One shot by one shot we shoot

1110
01:48:21,650 --> 01:48:22,685
In total we shoot 8 shots

1111
01:48:22,751 --> 01:48:25,527
Then when we go for
emergency gathering...

1112
01:48:25,554 --> 01:48:26,589
Please be quiet
