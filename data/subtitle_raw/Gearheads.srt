1
00:01:38,496 --> 00:01:39,498
Three more to go in our

2
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:40,700
final qualifier tonight,

3
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:42,535
and it's hidden taking control.

4
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:44,436
Close behind is
Slegger and Williams,

5
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:46,239
double wide and three and four,

6
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,073
now all bunched up

7
00:01:47,105 --> 00:01:48,307
heading to the
front straight away.

8
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,680
Side by side, rim to rim,

9
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:56,348
takes a high line,
Bill needs to go slow.

10
00:02:04,256 --> 00:02:06,859
Slides into one and two.

11
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:11,164
There's the white,
one more time,

12
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,431
wants the future spot,

13
00:02:12,463 --> 00:02:13,633
so does Snider.

14
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:15,501
Still, holding onto
the lead is Hinton.

15
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:16,668
Here we go, here we go,

16
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:18,871
back into the straight away.

17
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:23,276
It's game on, and the
turns are leading.

18
00:02:23,308 --> 00:02:24,843
Now four, into the finish line.

19
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:26,546
It's gonna be Hinton and Snider

20
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,680
in tonight's feature,

21
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,281
coming up next.

22
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,449
<b>GEARHEADS</b>

23
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:09,525
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

24
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:24,604
And here we go, it's race time.

25
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,538
Powering in to an early
lead in tonight's feature

26
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:27,939
is Walter,

27
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:30,309
who got a another full house
here inside of our town.

28
00:03:30,342 --> 00:03:31,711
Thanks again for filling
up those bleachers

29
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:33,413
every Friday night.

30
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,848
Here comes Bobby Dunlap
Senior on the high line,

31
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,782
into turn four, he
overtakes Walter,

32
00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:39,284
opening up some distance.

33
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:41,921
Nobody hangs onto
a lead like Dunlap.

34
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:45,358
He's in his rocking chair now.

35
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,492
Still in second,

36
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:48,527
it's Walter, double
wide out of turn four.

37
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,295
We have Phillips and Baker.

38
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,730
It's Bobby Dunlap Senior,

39
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,700
made them all choke on
that red dust once again.

40
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:58,503
He has his mechanic Lucas here.

41
00:03:58,537 --> 00:04:01,907
Been almost unbeatable since
18 and a half years ago.

42
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:04,544
Seems nobody can build a car
like that, their car good.

43
00:04:12,383 --> 00:04:13,785
Running high now
down to the low line,

44
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:16,354
old Bobby D's been turning
left and doing all right,

45
00:04:16,387 --> 00:04:18,290
so if he thinks there's
a groove way down there,

46
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,492
maybe he's right.

47
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:29,935
Two to go.

48
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,306
What's going
on with the 55?

49
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:35,507
He's spinning loose.

50
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,377
Real loose.

51
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:42,281
Does the steering
wheel even work?

52
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:44,517
He out of control.

53
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,286
Hit the brakes, Bobby.

54
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,355
Get the fire trucks over there.

55
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:52,458
Bobby!

56
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:06,072
Bobby.

57
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:09,875
Bobby Junior.

58
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,946
I know you're down there.

59
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,834
Deputy Clarke.

60
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:38,471
Fishin'

61
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,675
What do you say
we go for a ride?

62
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,381
Look, Bobby.

63
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:49,647
I told you before,

64
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,815
if you missed another day

65
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:53,752
the school is gonna
come down on you.

66
00:05:57,723 --> 00:05:59,391
I ain't goin'
to summer school.

67
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,795
Well, I understand.

68
00:06:02,827 --> 00:06:05,497
But maybe a different learning
environment is what you need.

69
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:10,536
It's called work study.

70
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:15,441
Luke?

71
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:19,512
There's no way man.

72
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,713
There ain't no way.

73
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:22,180
Bobby, Bobby.

74
00:06:22,213 --> 00:06:24,983
He's the only one who
even returned my call.

75
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,555
It's eight bucks an hour.

76
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,202
Don't tell those
global warmies.

77
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:45,603
This baby burns a
full gallon of gas

78
00:06:45,637 --> 00:06:47,506
just turning over.

79
00:06:55,613 --> 00:06:57,215
Can I help you, sir?

80
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:58,551
Sir?

81
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,951
That's what I'm talkin' about.

82
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:07,492
Is there any specials today?

83
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,632
Hey.

84
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:18,536
I was steaks today,

85
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:20,572
and everybody picked
up their to goes.

86
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,576
What do you call this?

87
00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:26,979
I call it free.

88
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,216
Here.

89
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,551
Put a bunch of mustard on it.

90
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:34,920
Won't even taste
the burned parts.

91
00:07:34,952 --> 00:07:36,822
The burned parts?

92
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:09,288
Look at that.

93
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:10,689
Dude.

94
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:12,757
That chick is
hillbilly white trash.

95
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:15,728
I'm gonna make her mine.

96
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:18,664
Ho ho.

97
00:08:19,564 --> 00:08:21,233
Check this out.

98
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:22,701
Well if the whole trailer park

99
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:24,269
didn't come down here today.

100
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:26,805
So say hello?

101
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:35,615
Let's tune him up.

102
00:08:58,003 --> 00:08:59,972
Another smart-ass t-shirt.

103
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:03,174
Probably burns the flag too.

104
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:05,144
Hey pal.

105
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,046
Sorry about the whole eye thing.

106
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:08,313
You know, I heard you
were talking all kinds

107
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:11,716
of mess about me, so
I had to represent.

108
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:14,620
So what?

109
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:15,754
You all like, what?

110
00:09:15,787 --> 00:09:17,690
Straight up gangsters
or something?

111
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:19,324
You know what?
That's it.

112
00:09:19,357 --> 00:09:22,627
Hey, hey hey.
Calm down, calm down.

113
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,928
Listen, man.

114
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:26,932
I came down here to
apologize to you.

115
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:28,133
I just found out

116
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:29,936
that you didn't even do it.

117
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,673
I made the extra effort
to come and find you.

118
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:36,274
I swear.

119
00:09:36,307 --> 00:09:38,744
What do ya say?

120
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,350
See, was that so hard, man?

121
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,052
Now listen, pal.

122
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:49,922
You see that girl over there.

123
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,591
Do you know her?

124
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,060
Naw, I've never
seen her before.

125
00:09:56,094 --> 00:09:59,031
She's white trash,
just like you.

126
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:00,632
Shut up, Dale.

127
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,635
I'm trying to talk
to my friend here.

128
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:07,873
So what's her deal?

129
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,776
She got a name?

130
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,780
Dude, you really
wanna know her name?

131
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,350
Go read her name tag.

132
00:10:22,754 --> 00:10:24,856
You hear this guy?

133
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,693
Listen up, buddy boy.

134
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:29,894
That little shiner

135
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:32,898
is nothing compared
to what's coming.

136
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,272
I will own your ass.

137
00:10:50,347 --> 00:10:52,717
Nice seeing ya, fellas.

138
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,437
It's just dancing,

139
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,872
but with less clothes.

140
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:49,774
Bobby, is that you?

141
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,181
No, I'm not gonna tell you
this again, Jamie Monroe.

142
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:58,317
What you do with your
body is your business,

143
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,951
and I will never
judge you for it,

144
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,721
but there is no way I
am ever gonna do that.

145
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,057
Hold on one second.

146
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:08,293
Come on, girl.
Don't be shy.

147
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:09,927
Later.

148
00:12:09,961 --> 00:12:10,962
There's a
whole lot of money down here.

149
00:12:12,563 --> 00:12:14,199
More than you'll make
selling chickens.

150
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:17,769
So when did you
say I can start?

151
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:47,432
I hear they had to wake
you up off the bar last week.

152
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,269
Must've been over served.

153
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,506
I got a friend
coming in to work.

154
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:56,107
I told you I could get somebody.

155
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:02,980
You ain't drinkin' no more?

156
00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:05,150
Ain't drinkin' any less.

157
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,350
School sent me over.

158
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,385
Told me to give you that.

159
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:10,107
All right.

160
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,976
I need these parts.

161
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:14,446
Tools are here,
parts go in there.

162
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:19,685
Okay, but how
do I know what...

163
00:15:24,154 --> 00:15:25,624
All right then.

164
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,033
Darling, you ready?

165
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:39,071
Honey, don't do that.

166
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,205
You'll ruin your makeup.

167
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:41,240
Come on.

168
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:44,009
It'll be fine.

169
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:45,143
You're lookin' real hot.

170
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:46,478
They'll love you.

171
00:15:48,046 --> 00:15:49,415
I don't know.

172
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:53,352
I don't know if I
can do this, Jamie.

173
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:55,086
Of course you can.

174
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,655
Just smile and make
'em feel special.

175
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:02,394
I gotta go work the floor
while they still love me.

176
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:06,565
So hot.

177
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:10,436
You're gonna make a ton of
cash of of them mill boys.

178
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:14,466
Here you go, boys.

179
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:22,339
Well, thank you, sweetheart.

180
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:23,741
You're welcome.

181
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:27,178
So why ain't you up there?

182
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:33,317
Jeez.
Mind your manners, boy.

183
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:35,087
Apologize to the lady now.

184
00:17:36,453 --> 00:17:38,089
That, that's all right.

185
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,392
Someone's gotta keep
bringing the beers.

186
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:13,125
Welcome
ladies and gentleman,

187
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:15,459
and thank you for making
it down to the speedway.

188
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:17,895
The cars are warm and
the drivers are ready.

189
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:21,133
It's now time to get
onto our time trials.

190
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:22,166
The last group is
coming off the track,

191
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,536
and that's it for our hot laps.

192
00:18:24,568 --> 00:18:26,471
We have many generations
with us tonight,

193
00:18:26,503 --> 00:18:29,140
in the true tradition
of dirt track racing.

194
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:34,211
Come on, Travis.

195
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:36,180
We should leave her alone.

196
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:38,182
She doesn't know what
she's missing out on.

197
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:40,685
She should be serving me,

198
00:18:40,718 --> 00:18:43,855
not greasy burgers
and burnt toast.

199
00:18:46,257 --> 00:18:48,259
So that Dunlap,

200
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:51,195
he's been working with that
whack job up at the junk yard.

201
00:18:54,231 --> 00:18:59,203
Is that right?

202
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:09,248
So he didn't say a word?

203
00:19:10,914 --> 00:19:12,651
Barely two.

204
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,521
Crazy drunk if you ask me.

205
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,432
Bobby Junior, why
won't you talk to me?

206
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:34,939
What do you want me to say?

207
00:19:48,252 --> 00:19:50,288
I gotta get to work.

208
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,961
See ya.

209
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:03,500
What are you doing
creeping around here?

210
00:20:03,534 --> 00:20:06,270
I say you here,
I figured I'd come say hey.

211
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:07,706
Yeah?

212
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,008
Yeah, just got a
new lift kit in my truck,

213
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,475
and I thought maybe
you and I could

214
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:13,377
go for a drive sometime.

215
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:15,513
That is if you're single.

216
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:17,282
I'll think about it.

217
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:21,620
You think about it.

218
00:22:15,465 --> 00:22:17,935
And here
we go, it's race time.

219
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,403
Powering into an early lead

220
00:22:19,436 --> 00:22:21,438
in tonight's feature is Walter.

221
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:23,375
We've got another full
house here in Solder town.

222
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:24,842
Thanks again for filling
up those bleachers

223
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,778
every Friday night.

224
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,879
Here comes Bobby Dunlap
Senior on the high line,

225
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:31,048
into turn four, he
overtakes Walter,

226
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:32,450
opening up some distance.

227
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:35,552
Nobody hangs onto
a lead like Dunlap.

228
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:44,062
He and his mechanic Lucas here,
he's been almost unbeatable

229
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:46,431
since 18 years ago.

230
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:51,635
Seems nobody can
build a car like that.

231
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,808
Riding high, and now
bound to the low line,

232
00:22:57,842 --> 00:23:00,078
old Bobby D's been turning
left and doing all right,

233
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:01,813
so if he thinks there's
a groove way down there,

234
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:03,582
well, maybe he's right.

235
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,536
Checkered flag!

236
00:23:24,568 --> 00:23:26,471
Really racking up
them points now.

237
00:23:26,503 --> 00:23:29,440
He's definitely in contention
for the Martin Cup once again.

238
00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:54,865
Okay, I'll see
you tomorrow night.

239
00:23:54,898 --> 00:23:57,033
Thanks, Higgy.

240
00:23:57,034 --> 00:23:58,003
Hey.

241
00:23:59,036 --> 00:24:00,505
You're doing a good job.

242
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:37,040
I need 16 15 inch tires
with the rim separate.

243
00:24:37,074 --> 00:24:42,547
Okay.

244
00:24:46,683 --> 00:24:48,787
Do you got an impact
wrench or something?

245
00:24:51,788 --> 00:24:55,192
It's out of sorts.

246
00:24:59,596 --> 00:25:01,266
You've got to be joking.

247
00:26:53,877 --> 00:26:54,980
All right.

248
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:03,788
Hey there, Daisy Duke.

249
00:27:06,323 --> 00:27:08,726
I got a big race tomorrow night.

250
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,260
Yeah?

251
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:14,232
Yeah, I think you
need to be there.

252
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:15,667
Is that right?

253
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:18,202
That's right.

254
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:23,740
Caution
lights are down.

255
00:27:23,773 --> 00:27:25,809
Here we go, only three more
for the checkered flag.

256
00:27:25,843 --> 00:27:27,178
Tilman powers into the hotline.

257
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:28,813
The number 27 won't let...

258
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,394
Coming out of turn four, on
the front, straight away.

259
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:57,041
There's the light.

260
00:27:57,074 --> 00:27:58,843
One more time.

261
00:27:59,777 --> 00:28:00,878
Tilman on back straight away,

262
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:02,413
now in the final turn.

263
00:28:03,847 --> 00:28:05,082
Checkered flag!

264
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:07,050
He's gonna beat Travis
Tilman in victory lane

265
00:28:07,084 --> 00:28:08,753
for the fifth time this summer.

266
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:10,755
Really racking up
them points now.

267
00:28:10,788 --> 00:28:13,758
He's definitely in contention
for the Martin cup once again.

268
00:28:17,127 --> 00:28:18,795
What's up?

269
00:28:18,828 --> 00:28:21,798
Well, I'm gonna need you
to move them cars up there,

270
00:28:21,832 --> 00:28:23,201
to down there.

271
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,769
Yeah, but...

272
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:27,305
You'll figure it out.

273
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:21,226
Lucas.

274
00:29:25,195 --> 00:29:27,964
Hey, Lucas.

275
00:29:34,971 --> 00:29:37,008
Lucas.

276
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,809
Come on, man.

277
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:41,945
I can't do this.

278
00:29:43,247 --> 00:29:44,783
I don't drive.

279
00:29:48,952 --> 00:29:50,954
Can't you just tow 'em?

280
00:32:37,253 --> 00:32:40,958
I will own your ass.

281
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,161
Lucas.

282
00:32:44,193 --> 00:32:45,596
Come on, man.

283
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,499
I can't do this.

284
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:52,135
I don't drive.

285
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:08,519
That Travis Tilman
sure doesn't like to lose.

286
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:11,154
While other drivers may
not like his aggressive,

287
00:33:11,188 --> 00:33:12,456
sometimes dangerous style,

288
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:15,125
he certainly knows how
to rack up the victories.

289
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,164
Hey.

290
00:33:21,198 --> 00:33:22,432
You see me out there?

291
00:33:22,465 --> 00:33:23,700
I sure did.

292
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:28,072
You see me win?

293
00:33:28,105 --> 00:33:29,507
I did.

294
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:31,608
Should we go celebrate?

295
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,177
Let's go.

296
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:28,265
There you are.

297
00:34:28,297 --> 00:34:30,433
Here, hold this.

298
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:31,802
What is this?

299
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,173
See...

300
00:34:36,206 --> 00:34:39,210
Motion creates electricity.

301
00:34:39,242 --> 00:34:42,278
Electricity creates motion.

302
00:34:42,311 --> 00:34:46,317
And it all starts with
magnetism from the poles.

303
00:34:59,228 --> 00:35:02,599
It's all in there.

304
00:35:06,603 --> 00:35:08,239
Yeah, this
baby's a beaut.

305
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:10,273
440, dual exhaust,
heated seats.

306
00:35:10,306 --> 00:35:12,175
Can't beat that with a bet.

307
00:35:12,909 --> 00:35:15,245
How's it run without nitrous?

308
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:20,551
Inhalation, compression.

309
00:35:21,617 --> 00:35:24,322
Ignition, exhaust.

310
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:28,192
Art.

311
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,827
Pardon me.

312
00:35:32,228 --> 00:35:34,164
Mastery of hand.

313
00:35:34,197 --> 00:35:37,367
Confidence of stroke.

314
00:36:57,614 --> 00:36:59,317
What the?

315
00:37:13,429 --> 00:37:16,000
How can you stand so
close to those speakers?

316
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,336
I said how can you
stand so close to those...

317
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:21,372
It's the only way
to take it, buddy.

318
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,474
Yeah, well, it
almost blew me over.

319
00:37:24,507 --> 00:37:26,409
Woo yes, sound
waves will do that.

320
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:28,445
They push things around.

321
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:30,681
And if you're looking
for maximum heavyocity...

322
00:37:35,351 --> 00:37:38,321
Damn, I ain't never heard
no car sound like that.

323
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:40,456
Yeah, you can tune 'em
up, you can tune 'em down

324
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:42,425
any which way.

325
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:43,926
Just like a motor.

326
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:46,931
Woo!

327
00:37:48,431 --> 00:37:50,000
Humbuckers and horse power,

328
00:37:50,032 --> 00:37:51,969
now that's what
I'm talking about.

329
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:54,505
Woo.

330
00:37:55,472 --> 00:37:58,575
So what in the heck you
doin' here so early?

331
00:37:58,608 --> 00:37:59,977
It's two o'clock.

332
00:38:00,976 --> 00:38:02,846
What, in the afternoon?

333
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:06,484
Man.

334
00:38:07,884 --> 00:38:10,487
I must've got
accidentally drunk.

335
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:13,423
I'll put the coffee on.

336
00:38:19,396 --> 00:38:21,999
Yeah, it's Friday night.

337
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:23,534
You ain't goin' nowhere

338
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:26,003
'till that whole
paycheck is gone.

339
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:27,871
Congratulations.

340
00:38:27,903 --> 00:38:29,739
New guy pays all night.

341
00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:31,709
Hell yeah, I'm
fixin' to get wilder

342
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,911
than a filler goat
tonight, boys.

343
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:35,478
Woo.

344
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,927
Lucas.

345
00:38:51,494 --> 00:38:52,630
Higgy.

346
00:38:55,431 --> 00:38:57,367
New girl in town?

347
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,369
Naw, it's Jamie's friend.

348
00:38:59,402 --> 00:39:00,737
Chill.

349
00:39:01,905 --> 00:39:03,607
Sick of the farm I guess.

350
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:10,413
Another round?

351
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:16,420
Save it for the dancers, sir.

352
00:39:18,454 --> 00:39:19,422
How 'bout a lap dance?

353
00:39:19,456 --> 00:39:20,691
Get off of me!

354
00:39:24,894 --> 00:39:27,097
Get out of here now.

355
00:39:45,181 --> 00:39:48,851
So, when did your sister start

356
00:39:48,885 --> 00:39:52,156
working at the strip club?

357
00:39:56,525 --> 00:39:58,928
What do you mean?

358
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:01,465
You know it can get
pretty rough in there.

359
00:40:02,498 --> 00:40:03,833
What happened?

360
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,083
What, are you gonna pick
her up on your handle bars?

361
00:40:53,516 --> 00:40:55,485
I'll meet you outside.

362
00:40:58,188 --> 00:40:59,523
Hey.

363
00:40:59,556 --> 00:41:01,492
Hey, you out of your mind?

364
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,894
Bobby, what are
you doin' here?

365
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:05,528
Yeah, I could ask
you the same thing.

366
00:41:06,996 --> 00:41:09,032
I work here.

367
00:41:13,603 --> 00:41:14,605
Are you all right?

368
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:26,849
Since when are you driving?

369
00:41:26,882 --> 00:41:29,152
What are you doing
working at that place?

370
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:32,722
You saw that sheriff's notice.

371
00:41:33,789 --> 00:41:34,824
We can't make that kind of money

372
00:41:34,858 --> 00:41:36,494
working at the corner store.

373
00:41:38,094 --> 00:41:40,097
Lucas told me what
happened tonight.

374
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:45,001
Who were they?

375
00:41:47,704 --> 00:41:50,508
Bobby, I ain't strippin'
if that's what your thinkin'.

376
00:41:52,342 --> 00:41:54,512
I didn't need that
image in my head.

377
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,750
Shut up.

378
00:42:02,351 --> 00:42:03,820
Look, I just...

379
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:07,525
I just don't wanna
lose the house.

380
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,930
Yeah, me neither.

381
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:18,067
So you know Lucas?

382
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:23,039
Yeah, he was Daddy's
mechanic and partner.

383
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,976
Don't you remember?

384
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:31,314
I was five when Dad died.

385
00:42:32,815 --> 00:42:36,018
He and Daddy would be
in that garage for hours,

386
00:42:36,052 --> 00:42:39,557
and their heads buried
under the hood of some car.

387
00:42:41,657 --> 00:42:44,661
He don't act like he knows me.

388
00:43:00,876 --> 00:43:02,612
Hey, you're back?

389
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,114
Everything all right
with your sister?

390
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:07,318
Hey now, you're gonna
damage the equipment.

391
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:11,355
Did you have that machine

392
00:43:11,387 --> 00:43:14,625
hooked up to my Daddy's car?

393
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,363
Is that how he died?

394
00:43:20,362 --> 00:43:22,165
Look, it's not
that simple, Bobby.

395
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,835
Hey now.

396
00:43:24,867 --> 00:43:26,603
It's time I told ya.

397
00:43:27,336 --> 00:43:29,739
Now, that night
your Daddy and I,

398
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,708
we were testing out a theory.

399
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:35,144
Hey, but we lost control.

400
00:43:39,782 --> 00:43:40,784
Hey.

401
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:42,719
You know what gets me?

402
00:43:42,751 --> 00:43:44,721
Is you never told me.

403
00:43:44,753 --> 00:43:46,155
You never said a damn word.

404
00:43:47,023 --> 00:43:49,727
Bobby, your Daddy
and I had a plan.

405
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,663
We just didn't know
how far it would go.

406
00:43:53,762 --> 00:43:54,931
Bobby!

407
00:43:58,867 --> 00:44:01,270
My family
owns all of this.

408
00:44:04,873 --> 00:44:06,809
The lake looks
beautiful to me.

409
00:44:07,876 --> 00:44:09,079
So do you.

410
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,782
Travis.

411
00:44:15,784 --> 00:44:17,086
C'mon, you know you want it.

412
00:44:18,922 --> 00:44:19,889
Travis.

413
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:22,358
Travis, stop it.

414
00:44:23,726 --> 00:44:24,728
Travis stop it!

415
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,929
Don't.

416
00:44:25,961 --> 00:44:27,130
Don't you wanna
be with a winner?

417
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:30,900
Where are you goin'?

418
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:35,739
Where are you goin', Mae?

419
00:47:07,422 --> 00:47:08,557
That night,
your Daddy and I,

420
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:11,060
we were testing out a theory.

421
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:13,297
We were manipulating
time and space.

422
00:47:14,664 --> 00:47:18,268
Hey, but we lost control.

423
00:47:24,974 --> 00:47:27,577
Is that how he died?

424
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:30,012
Look, it's
not that simple, Bobby.

425
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,655
Bobby Dunlap
Junior's car has left the track

426
00:47:38,688 --> 00:47:41,324
in a crash eerily similar to
the one that claimed the life

427
00:47:41,356 --> 00:47:43,360
of his father 12 years ago.

428
00:47:57,507 --> 00:47:59,476
We regret to inform you
that Bobby Dunlap Junior

429
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:02,512
did not survive the crash.

430
00:48:14,456 --> 00:48:15,925
Bases loaded,
bottom of the ninth,

431
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:18,261
two outs, here comes the pitch,

432
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,999
he got all of that one.

433
00:48:23,032 --> 00:48:24,300
Home run, baby!

434
00:48:26,034 --> 00:48:28,203
That was awesome.

435
00:48:32,307 --> 00:48:33,242
Hey.

436
00:48:35,043 --> 00:48:36,545
Can I help you?

437
00:48:36,579 --> 00:48:38,048
Can we talk?

438
00:48:39,148 --> 00:48:40,284
Please.

439
00:48:52,661 --> 00:48:55,130
What do you got there?

440
00:48:55,164 --> 00:48:58,134
Travis, what are
you doing here?

441
00:48:58,166 --> 00:49:00,737
Why haven't you
been returning my calls?

442
00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:02,072
Don't you remember?

443
00:49:03,438 --> 00:49:05,207
Why you bringing that up?

444
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,543
We need to talk.

445
00:49:13,248 --> 00:49:14,350
Are you okay?

446
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:17,052
Ain't like hitting girls, is it?

447
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:24,193
You picked the wrong day, man.

448
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:31,501
Are you all right?

449
00:49:31,534 --> 00:49:34,269
I almost had him, you know.

450
00:49:34,302 --> 00:49:35,739
I saw that.

451
00:49:37,206 --> 00:49:40,210
Come on, let's go get some ice.

452
00:50:06,235 --> 00:50:07,437
You sure this is his place?

453
00:50:07,469 --> 00:50:09,571
Yeah, that's it right there.

454
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:12,074
That redneck sucker
punched the wrong guy.

455
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:15,044
Yeah, he got you good.

456
00:50:15,077 --> 00:50:16,612
Shut up, Dale.

457
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:18,148
Help me find a way inside.

458
00:50:32,394 --> 00:50:34,663
Yo, this don't
look like his room.

459
00:50:34,697 --> 00:50:36,700
Might be his sister's.

460
00:50:57,619 --> 00:51:00,123
This might get
us a little profit.

461
00:51:00,155 --> 00:51:02,625
Maybe even a new
exhaust manifold.

462
00:51:06,394 --> 00:51:07,396
Bingo.

463
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:31,654
They took it all.

464
00:51:36,324 --> 00:51:38,293
Bobby Junior.

465
00:51:38,327 --> 00:51:40,163
I heard what happened.

466
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,700
Yeah, they took all the
money Michelle had saved.

467
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,301
I know you're totally
against the idea

468
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:46,469
of racing and everything,

469
00:51:46,501 --> 00:51:49,105
but, the prize is
10,000 dollars.

470
00:51:53,342 --> 00:51:55,912
It's worth a shot.

471
00:51:55,945 --> 00:51:57,580
This is what
it's all about, folks.

472
00:51:57,612 --> 00:51:59,882
Passing down the tradition
through your family

473
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,217
and your good buddies.

474
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:02,585
Dirt track racing
is real racing.

475
00:52:02,617 --> 00:52:05,855
Home grown, served up
right here at the speedway.

476
00:53:21,864 --> 00:53:23,567
Lucas.

477
00:53:28,036 --> 00:53:32,675
Hey Lucas.

478
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,281
Lucas.

479
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:50,527
Hey...

480
00:53:53,362 --> 00:53:54,697
About before...

481
00:53:57,766 --> 00:54:00,469
Me too.

482
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:06,242
For everything, Bobby.

483
00:54:07,876 --> 00:54:12,949
Sorry.

484
00:54:17,452 --> 00:54:18,822
Beautiful.

485
00:54:19,688 --> 00:54:25,761
This place in the morning.

486
00:54:30,398 --> 00:54:31,900
Hey Lucas...

487
00:54:35,771 --> 00:54:38,341
Can you do me a favor?

488
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:44,847
Can you teach me how to race?

489
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:51,420
I've been waitin'
for you to ask.

490
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:06,936
You ready?

491
00:55:08,704 --> 00:55:12,642
Now, until you crash
or hit the wall,

492
00:55:12,675 --> 00:55:15,979
a man never truly
understands racin'.

493
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,916
A good driver has
concern for the wall,

494
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:21,918
but he pushes past it.

495
00:55:22,751 --> 00:55:27,523
A complete racer has
respect, but no fear.

496
00:55:31,092 --> 00:55:32,861
All right.

497
00:55:32,894 --> 00:55:36,032
Good talk.

498
00:55:52,981 --> 00:55:56,518
Hell, we got all day.

499
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:29,485
That dog will hunt.

500
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:06,822
Pretty sight, ain't it?

501
00:57:08,724 --> 00:57:12,195
Yeah, Lucas, this
may sound crazy, but,

502
00:57:14,262 --> 00:57:16,465
I swear I can hear music.

503
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:20,669
You feel it right down
to the bone, don't ya?

504
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:24,840
The rhythm of them cylinders,

505
00:57:24,873 --> 00:57:26,842
it's like a symphony.

506
00:57:29,677 --> 00:57:33,048
When you start driving with
your ears, not just your eyes,

507
00:57:34,115 --> 00:57:37,619
you begin to understand
what you're doing here,

508
00:57:37,652 --> 00:57:40,522
what you're all about.

509
00:57:44,293 --> 00:57:45,695
Took your Daddy a
lot longer than that

510
00:57:45,728 --> 00:57:48,998
to hear that orchestra play.

511
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:08,550
All right, watch out
for snakes and spiders.

512
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:12,622
It's like your
Daddy used to say,

513
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,557
if you're not doing something
with what you learn,

514
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:16,925
you ain't worth a damn.

515
00:58:20,896 --> 00:58:22,664
It's your Daddy's old backup.

516
00:58:25,701 --> 00:58:28,505
I reckon he'd want
you to have it.

517
00:58:31,739 --> 00:58:35,978
Damn, I don't
know what to say.

518
00:59:12,914 --> 00:59:14,284
Hey Michelle.

519
00:59:15,951 --> 00:59:17,786
Looks like I got a ride.

520
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:19,588
Do you know this guy?

521
00:59:19,621 --> 00:59:21,757
Yeah, that's my brother.

522
00:59:21,789 --> 00:59:23,692
He's a cutie ain't he?

523
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,827
Don't even think about it.

524
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:26,962
Okay, okay.

525
00:59:29,231 --> 00:59:31,267
See you tomorrow.

526
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,818
Yeah,
this is the place.

527
01:00:27,755 --> 01:00:31,226
Eenie meenie miney, hose.

528
01:00:48,242 --> 01:00:49,846
My goodness.

529
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,882
What happened?

530
01:00:54,449 --> 01:00:57,952
Well, I stepped out.

531
01:00:57,985 --> 01:01:00,722
Lucas, what
happened to the car?

532
01:01:02,123 --> 01:01:04,393
Somebody broke in.

533
01:01:05,994 --> 01:01:08,364
They sure knew what
they were doin'.

534
01:01:09,831 --> 01:01:11,768
Why would anybody
wanna do this?

535
01:01:14,503 --> 01:01:16,239
Bad ethics.

536
01:01:18,106 --> 01:01:19,809
Can we fix it?

537
01:01:20,409 --> 01:01:24,146
Whoever it was, wasn't just
trying to mess up the paint.

538
01:01:24,179 --> 01:01:26,749
The race is in
less than a week.

539
01:01:28,282 --> 01:01:30,853
Well, that doesn't give
us much time now, does it?

540
01:01:34,356 --> 01:01:36,359
Hey, hand me that
wrench, would ya?

541
01:01:48,336 --> 01:01:49,338
Lucas.

542
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:51,140
Yeah?

543
01:01:52,775 --> 01:01:54,376
What if I don't win?

544
01:01:55,911 --> 01:01:58,012
Well...

545
01:01:58,045 --> 01:01:59,715
You never know.

546
01:02:03,485 --> 01:02:06,189
I mean, you've
seen me out there.

547
01:02:07,889 --> 01:02:09,190
I ain't the fastest,

548
01:02:09,224 --> 01:02:12,461
and I definitely ain't
the most experienced.

549
01:02:13,862 --> 01:02:16,999
Well, none of that
is gonna matter none.

550
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,369
You mean none of
that's gonna matter.

551
01:02:20,402 --> 01:02:22,371
Well, you got somethin'
none of them got.

552
01:02:24,539 --> 01:02:25,641
Like what?

553
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:29,778
You're gonna say I have
heart or spirit or something.

554
01:02:29,811 --> 01:02:31,346
No, more important.

555
01:02:32,347 --> 01:02:34,483
You got your Daddy's blood,

556
01:02:34,516 --> 01:02:37,052
and I swear that
man had motor oil

557
01:02:37,085 --> 01:02:39,021
coursin' through his veins.

558
01:02:41,389 --> 01:02:43,192
What if that ain't enough?

559
01:02:44,358 --> 01:02:48,364
Well, it's what you got.

560
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:18,387
You're not gonna do
something to the car, are you?

561
01:04:22,324 --> 01:04:24,427
You don't have to
worry about any of this.

562
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:28,530
You just keep your
wheels on the track.

563
01:04:32,967 --> 01:04:35,070
This is my path.

564
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:17,979
Ain't this excitin'?

565
01:05:19,547 --> 01:05:23,018
Welcome to the show.

566
01:05:27,621 --> 01:05:30,960
Yep.

567
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:36,999
The rumors are true.

568
01:05:37,032 --> 01:05:38,401
You're paintin' again.

569
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:44,006
Where are you off to?

570
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:44,974
I was gonna see Bobby,

571
01:05:45,007 --> 01:05:49,043
see if Bobby needed
help with his project.

572
01:05:49,077 --> 01:05:50,947
I thought he was
finished with that.

573
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:56,152
Hopefully today he will be.

574
01:06:00,422 --> 01:06:01,623
Where's Bobby?

575
01:06:01,655 --> 01:06:03,726
He got called up
for his time trials.

576
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:06,996
Should be finishing
up about now.

577
01:06:07,028 --> 01:06:07,996
I missed it?

578
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:10,432
Yeah, he got bumped
up on the list.

579
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:17,440
Wait, here he comes.

580
01:06:21,643 --> 01:06:23,612
Well, how'd you do?

581
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:29,751
Made the cut.

582
01:06:29,784 --> 01:06:31,452
That's great.

583
01:06:31,485 --> 01:06:33,054
How'd Tilman do?

584
01:06:34,088 --> 01:06:35,190
He's up now.

585
01:06:37,224 --> 01:06:39,060
Well, don't worry about him.

586
01:06:41,096 --> 01:06:43,164
You'll see him soon enough.

587
01:06:46,467 --> 01:06:48,503
Don't forget to
come on down to the midway.

588
01:06:48,536 --> 01:06:49,637
Under the bleachers,

589
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:51,205
you get your racing
gear, good food,

590
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:53,208
and an ice cold drink.

591
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,344
Lots of flavors not be missed...

592
01:06:58,346 --> 01:07:00,282
Careful now.

593
01:07:00,315 --> 01:07:02,251
Don't wanna over tighten it.

594
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:03,285
It seemed like it
was running a bit,

595
01:07:03,318 --> 01:07:05,421
retching the heat.

596
01:07:05,454 --> 01:07:07,589
Yeah, that oughta do it.

597
01:07:07,621 --> 01:07:09,157
Now start 'up.

598
01:07:20,402 --> 01:07:21,637
Right on pitch!

599
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:25,273
You should really pull
out of those turns now.

600
01:07:34,882 --> 01:07:37,118
You come a long way,

601
01:07:38,385 --> 01:07:39,422
and

602
01:07:41,822 --> 01:07:44,393
I'm proud of ya.

603
01:07:44,425 --> 01:07:45,827
Thanks, Luke.

604
01:07:47,461 --> 01:07:48,730
Yeah, well...

605
01:07:50,164 --> 01:07:52,768
Check them tires, I'm
gonna go grab a beer.

606
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:57,306
And
by the way, folks,

607
01:07:57,338 --> 01:07:58,606
don't forget to
stop by the Via W,

608
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:00,108
women's auxiliary bake sale

609
01:08:00,141 --> 01:08:01,509
by the concession stand.

610
01:08:01,543 --> 01:08:02,878
They're selling
mouth-watering cheery,

611
01:08:02,911 --> 01:08:03,846
and apple crumble pies

612
01:08:03,878 --> 01:08:06,214
made from scratch and
ready for the table.

613
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:09,485
All proceeds go to disabled
veterans in the local VA.

614
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:11,320
This is a great cause
run by some great ladies,

615
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:13,255
so let's get out there
and show your support

616
01:08:13,288 --> 01:08:14,121
for the veterans.

617
01:08:14,155 --> 01:08:16,257
God bless ya, and
God bless America.

618
01:08:17,225 --> 01:08:19,695
Knock 'em dead, Bobby Junior.

619
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:20,796
I will.

620
01:08:21,896 --> 01:08:23,099
Thanks, Mae.

621
01:08:25,332 --> 01:08:27,135
For everything, I mean,

622
01:08:27,168 --> 01:08:28,470
you've been amazing.

623
01:08:30,271 --> 01:08:31,474
I'm just happy I could help.

624
01:08:34,242 --> 01:08:36,212
Racers,
please lead your cars...

625
01:08:37,444 --> 01:08:39,280
I gotta...

626
01:08:39,314 --> 01:08:40,483
You'll do great.

627
01:08:42,783 --> 01:08:43,784
All right, drivers.

628
01:08:43,818 --> 01:08:45,787
This'll be a 25 lap race.

629
01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:48,590
The first one to cross
the finish line wins.

630
01:08:48,622 --> 01:08:50,424
We'll be running in
Durrow rules tonight boys.

631
01:08:50,457 --> 01:08:52,560
That means nothing stops
unless you flip over

632
01:08:52,594 --> 01:08:54,229
or catch on fire.

633
01:08:54,261 --> 01:08:55,898
At that point, a yellow
flag will come out,

634
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:57,599
a truck will push
you off the track.

635
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:00,769
Prize tonight's 10,000.

636
01:09:00,801 --> 01:09:02,837
Let's have a good race, boys.

637
01:09:13,715 --> 01:09:15,417
You picked the
wrong horse, Mae.

638
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:18,854
I don't know what
you're talking about.

639
01:09:18,886 --> 01:09:21,756
The kid's a natural.

640
01:09:22,823 --> 01:09:24,192
What'd he say?

641
01:11:06,060 --> 01:11:07,762
Here we go, the
big race final.

642
01:11:10,532 --> 01:11:12,601
Three time champion of
this 10,000 dollar race.

643
01:11:12,634 --> 01:11:13,502
He always

644
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:17,338
And get this, driving
in the 55 car,

645
01:11:17,372 --> 01:11:19,408
is newcomer, Bobby
Dunlap Junior.

646
01:11:25,012 --> 01:11:26,347
Dunlap looks past the past,

647
01:11:26,381 --> 01:11:28,284
but doesn't

648
01:11:30,118 --> 01:11:32,087
Bobby Junior is the son
of the great track legend,

649
01:11:32,119 --> 01:11:33,755
Bobby Dunlap Senior,

650
01:11:33,787 --> 01:11:34,922
and just as surprising,

651
01:11:34,956 --> 01:11:36,525
seeing his old equipment
man, Lucas, here,

652
01:11:36,557 --> 01:11:38,359
who seems to have
come out of retirement

653
01:11:38,393 --> 01:11:40,095
to get behind this young racer.

654
01:11:40,127 --> 01:11:41,063
Good luck, Bobby Junior,

655
01:11:41,095 --> 01:11:42,797
you're certainly gonna need it.

656
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:44,032
Racing may be Bobby Junior's...

657
01:11:45,533 --> 01:11:46,935
This is the first time
we see what this kid has

658
01:11:46,967 --> 01:11:49,305
what it takes to capture
the checkered flag.

659
01:12:03,484 --> 01:12:05,119
Tilman's trying to
pick up the final lead

660
01:12:05,153 --> 01:12:06,922
for the Martin Cup.

661
01:12:06,954 --> 01:12:08,090
Here we go.

662
01:12:08,122 --> 01:12:09,657
Turn green, turn
force into a file.

663
01:12:11,792 --> 01:12:13,362
Up to the high line.

664
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:14,696
Dunlap, he's gonna
take the low line,

665
01:12:14,729 --> 01:12:16,731
turning one and two.

666
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:18,367
He's gonna power away now.

667
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:20,469
Tilman, he's gonna try to
build up some momentum.

668
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,938
He's been on the high
line to make 'em up.

669
01:12:28,443 --> 01:12:30,612
Bobby Dunlap Junior has made
his way through the path,

670
01:12:30,645 --> 01:12:32,881
he's maneuvered
into second place.

671
01:12:32,913 --> 01:12:35,082
Challenging Tillman, we've
got lots of decent showman

672
01:12:35,115 --> 01:12:36,585
going on right now.

673
01:12:37,786 --> 01:12:41,056
These drivers want that 10,000
dollars something fierce.

674
01:12:44,591 --> 01:12:46,827
Travis Tilman and Bobby Junior
battling it out man to man,

675
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:48,095
machine to machine,

676
01:12:48,128 --> 01:12:49,730
this could come down
to the final stretch.

677
01:12:49,764 --> 01:12:51,400
He turns one and two,

678
01:12:51,432 --> 01:12:53,068
Dunlap looks to make
a move down low,

679
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:55,569
slips underneath
into three and four.

680
01:12:55,603 --> 01:12:57,572
If he flunks it, he's gonna
have to take it from Tilman,

681
01:12:57,604 --> 01:12:59,106
who's trying going on.

682
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:00,876
The back, straight away,
making a run for it.

683
01:13:00,908 --> 01:13:03,677
White flag, one more
time, it's game on now.

684
01:13:03,711 --> 01:13:04,945
It's Tilman and Dunlap.

685
01:13:04,979 --> 01:13:06,515
Tilman gonna take the high line,

686
01:13:06,547 --> 01:13:07,748
Bobby Junior's gonna
take the low line

687
01:13:07,782 --> 01:13:10,152
into three and four.

688
01:13:32,073 --> 01:13:33,575
He slams the door on Tilman.

689
01:13:33,608 --> 01:13:35,644
Here we go, it's
Tilman and Dunlap.

690
01:13:35,676 --> 01:13:37,578
Dunlap powers into
a lead out of four,

691
01:13:37,612 --> 01:13:39,815
now on the front, straight
away, it's Dunlap.

692
01:13:39,847 --> 01:13:41,115
Dunlap for the win,
and Bobby Junior

693
01:13:41,149 --> 01:13:45,020
takes the checkered flag.

694
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:50,525
And the Dunlap legacy
has been passed on

695
01:13:50,557 --> 01:13:52,493
to the next generation.

696
01:14:08,542 --> 01:14:15,483
Bobby Junior, we'll see
you in victory lane.

697
01:14:30,832 --> 01:14:31,900
Michelle!

698
01:14:31,932 --> 01:14:33,601
Woo!

699
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:35,971
Woo!

700
01:14:40,307 --> 01:14:41,609
Thank you, thank you.

701
01:14:43,077 --> 01:14:44,213
Woo!

702
01:14:47,582 --> 01:14:48,917
Thanks.

703
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:53,222
Man.

704
01:14:54,255 --> 01:14:55,556
Yeah.

705
01:15:37,832 --> 01:15:40,001
Bobby,

706
01:15:40,033 --> 01:15:42,570
It's clear to me that
you are exactly the man

707
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:44,306
your father would
have wanted you to be.

708
01:15:47,307 --> 01:15:49,610
Your Daddy would be proud,

709
01:15:49,644 --> 01:15:51,713
just like I am.

710
01:15:53,146 --> 01:15:55,617
Enclosed is the key to the shop.

711
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:59,086
You'll find the title and
other paperwork laid out

712
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:00,689
on the desk.

713
01:16:00,721 --> 01:16:02,657
It's yours now.

714
01:16:04,091 --> 01:16:06,360
I got some traveling to do.

715
01:16:06,394 --> 01:16:09,731
A journey that you've
helped me to brave.

716
01:16:11,632 --> 01:16:14,668
'Cause the truth is, well,

717
01:16:14,702 --> 01:16:18,640
the truth is different
for each man, ain't it?

718
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,876
But I reckon maybe that's
what we do on this earth.

719
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:27,815
We search for truth, and
if we're lucky, we find it

720
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:31,886
in who we are, and what we do.

721
01:16:35,355 --> 01:16:37,592
I was fortunate to meet
you and your Daddy.

722
01:16:40,194 --> 01:16:43,198
If I see him first, well,

723
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:45,900
I'll be sure to say hello.

724
01:16:48,101 --> 01:16:49,770
Good luck to you, Bobby.

725
01:16:50,738 --> 01:16:53,208
Your friend, Lucas.
