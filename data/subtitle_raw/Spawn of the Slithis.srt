1
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,084
- Come on.
- You can't catch this.

2
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:58,552
You can't catch it.

3
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,321
Told you, you can't
 catch this one.

4
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:02,223
- Don't throw it hard!

5
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,032
Here, come here quick!

6
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:06,153
Geez, I've never seen
 anything like it.

7
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,422
It looks kind of Patches
and Dakota, don't it?

8
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:11,292
I wonder if Mr. Payne knows.

9
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,663
Gary, where you goin'?

10
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:17,431
Come on chicken
 they won't hurt you.

11
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,266
They're dead.

12
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,302
Hey, Gary, wait up.

13
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:48,862
- Hey, Jeff.

14
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,732
There's an article in the
 Outlook here that says

15
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,834
they found two dogs near
 the Sherman Canal in Venice

16
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,336
that had been mutilated.

17
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,070
Police think it's some
 kind of ritualistic thing,

18
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,573
like those cattle they
 found in Colorado last year.

19
00:04:00,508 --> 00:04:01,642
- That sounds gruesome.

20
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,379
They've got some
 very strange people

21
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,780
walking around those canals.

22
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,751
- No, it's like
 that German Shepard

23
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,186
that I saw last week
 on the marina jetty,

24
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,189
when I was taking pictures
 of the outrigger races.

25
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,758
- Wayne, you said
 you found a dead dog

26
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,493
not a mutilated carcass.

27
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,429
- That's what was so odd.

28
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,397
The thing looked like
 it had been butchered.

29
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:25,733
It didn't look like an
animal sacrifice at all.

30
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,036
- Whatever that's
 supposed to look like.

31
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:31,038
Wayne, come on or I'm
gonna be late for work.

32
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:33,206
- It was more like the
flesh on Dakota had been

33
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,209
sucked right off the
 bones clean, you know?

34
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,612
- Will you hurry up or we're
 both gonna be late, come on.

35
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,647
- It wasn't a thing of beauty,

36
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:41,582
but I honestly couldn't imagine

37
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:42,816
anything human doing what I saw.

38
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,018
It was more like
 a piranha attack.

39
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,754
- Wayne, do you realize
that you've got a exam

40
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:48,689
in your first
 period class today?

41
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:52,259
Now what's gonna happen when
 you show up 10 minutes late?

42
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,861
- Well, I'll scratch the
first three questions,

43
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,496
and maybe one of the
kids will pass the test.

44
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,798
Sometimes I wonder
about our communication.

45
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,033
I'm talking enigma and
 you're talking exam.

46
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,435
- No, I'm not.

47
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:04,071
I'm just talking about
 getting to work on time, okay.

48
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:22,315
- Jack, wake up.

49
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,018
Jack, I now you're awake.

50
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,521
Now go see what that noise was.

51
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,558
- Helen, I know what it was.

52
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:33,326
It was that damn dog of yours.

53
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,395
- Go be sure.

54
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,800
- I'm sure.

55
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,077
- Maybe he's sick or hurt.

56
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,212
With this crazy business
going on around here,

57
00:06:52,212 --> 00:06:53,046
who can tell.

58
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,185
- Oh, Helen.

59
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:01,755
It's 3:00 a.m.

60
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:06,193
If the dog is sick, he can
 only get better or worse,

61
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:10,197
and right now either
 one is fine with me.

62
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,505
Christ, all right!

63
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:20,240
But if that damn dog has broken
through the screen again,

64
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,374
that's it he's out!

65
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:22,710
It's the pound!

66
00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:32,720
- Jack, I don't know why you

67
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,054
have to put on all your clothes.

68
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,490
You're only going
 to the living room.

69
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,291
Wear that nice
 robe I bought you.

70
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,995
- For 42 years I have
 gotten out of bed

71
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,064
and put on my clothes.

72
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:45,733
I detest bath robes.

73
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,401
Why you bought it is
 still a mystery to me.

74
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:52,272
Now, unless you want to go
 check on the dog, shut up!

75
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:53,440
- All right.

76
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,274
- Regal?

77
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:58,445
Damn.

78
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,049
Damn mutt that's it!

79
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,751
- Jack, what is it?

80
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:05,152
Is Regal alright?

81
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,154
- No, of course, he's all right.

82
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,789
In and out like a tornado.

83
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:11,391
You're gonna have a mess
 to clean up in the morning.

84
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:17,264
- Jack!

85
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,231
Jack!

86
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:40,080
- You know I couldn't believe
 that six period class.

87
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,381
I mean, I've gotta
 be wasting their time

88
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,951
because they're
certainly wasting mine.

89
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:45,218
There's a 12th
 grade group of kids

90
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,687
that are supposedly
 headed for college,

91
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,756
and some of them can't
 even formulate a sentence.

92
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,223
- Well, they've been passed
 up through the prerequisites,

93
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,759
or they wouldn't
be there, right?

94
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,762
- I know.

95
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,296
The system forces
 the instructors

96
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,231
to keep 'em moving,
 prepared or not,

97
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,668
which is just another
 reason why I'm getting

98
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:03,170
more turned off to
 teaching every day.

99
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,638
- You're getting turned off,

100
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,139
and then you're leaving the
 teaching to incompetents

101
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,375
like your esteemed
colleague, Mr. Blakely.

102
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,110
No, the good teaches
 are bailing out,

103
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,680
and then the Blakleys are
 just destroying young minds.

104
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,948
- This good teacher is about
 to blow some young minds

105
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,718
like when I fail half the
 kids in the Lighthouse staff.

106
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:20,087
It's the worst high school
 newspaper in the state.

107
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,955
- Ah.

108
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,057
- Marti Mason hit me with her
 favorite simile again today,

109
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,393
like a melted
 Popsicle in the sun.

110
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,295
She found it somewhere, and I
 swear she manages to lose it

111
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,262
at least once in every issue.

112
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,497
- Mr. Connors!

113
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,065
- Speaking of you know who.
 - Why me?

114
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,300
- Mr. Connors, listen to this.

115
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,567
- Now last
night the Venice Beach.

116
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:35,535
- It's about that
 article you read us

117
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:36,837
in Outlook the other day.

118
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,371
- In their
 small canal side home.

119
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,240
Police police and spokesman
 Commander Phillip Reed

120
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,209
released word today
 that an investigation

121
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,845
is currently underway to find
 the individuals responsible

122
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,980
for the mutilation murders
 of long time residents

123
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,749
Jack and Helen Dunn.

124
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,118
While this is the first such
 attack on the human populous,

125
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,586
the police reported that last
 week a similar mutilation

126
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,689
incident occurred
 involving several animals.

127
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,291
- See Mr. Connors,
that's what you read us.

128
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,460
- Okay, Marti, I'll read the
 rest in tomorrow's paper.

129
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,394
- Okay, Mr. Connors,
 I just thought

130
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,796
it was kind of funny, you know.

131
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:03,731
- Thank you, Marti.

132
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,401
- Does she always listen
to the news station?

133
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,703
- Oh, constantly,
 especially in class,

134
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,038
she's a teenage news junky.

135
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,511
You know, I think I'll
 see if the Dunn's address

136
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,413
is listed in the phone book.

137
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,682
It might be, long
 time resident and all.

138
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,217
- Why do you want the address?

139
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,856
- I'm not sure.

140
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:32,525
After finding that dog on the
 jetty, then those animals,

141
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,730
now this, it's kind
 of interesting.

142
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:38,999
- I think it's morbid.

143
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,102
Wayne, there's a lot
 of degenerate people

144
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,570
living around those canals.

145
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,073
Why don't you just
 stay out of it?

146
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:49,209
- Jeff, I'm just gonna take
 a look around that's all,

147
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,080
and call it the old
 journalist curiosity.

148
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:06,493
- Wayne, you are
 not a journalist.

149
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,728
You're a high school
 journalism teacher.

150
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,065
- After that class
today, I'm not so sure.

151
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,333
Look it's not
 going to involve me

152
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,802
if I just drive by
 the Dunn's place.

153
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:16,303
I mean, just drive by!

154
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,595
Hello, anybody home?

155
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,075
Hello?

156
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,921
- Okay, wiseguy, spread 'em.

157
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:49,122
Who are you and what
 are you doing here?

158
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,023
Spread 'em!

159
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,027
- Jesus, you scared me.

160
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,228
My name is Wayne Connors.

161
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,497
I'm a journalism teacher
at the high school.

162
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:58,498
I got identification.

163
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,200
- Okay, show it to me.

164
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,134
Slowly.

165
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:01,969
- Okay.

166
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:08,408
Here's my school ID,

167
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:12,045
my LAPD press card,
 my driver's license.

168
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,381
My new address is right
there on the back.

169
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:17,017
I got a gas credit card.
- You know, Mr. Connors.

170
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,485
These cards don't
 give you the right

171
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,187
to break into a
 private residence.

172
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:22,889
- No, of the course not.

173
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,124
I just knocked on the
door, and it swung open.

174
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,358
I guess, somebody
 forgot to close it.

175
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,227
- Well, a neighbor
 reported a prowler,

176
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,596
and you're lucky that I
got here before he did

177
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,164
because he's got
a loaded shotgun

178
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,333
and he's just spooked
 enough to use it.

179
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:36,803
Damn cold!

180
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,972
- Gesundheit.
 - Yeah, whatever.

181
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:42,342
- You should try of
these eucalyptus drops.

182
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:45,012
It'll make your eyes water,
 but they really work try one.

183
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,517
Say weren't you involved

184
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:52,052
in the initial
 investigation of this thing?

185
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,286
- Oh, I was.

186
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,488
If it hadn't been
 so damn vicious,

187
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,689
I could've had the day off

188
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,725
and probably gotten
 over this cold.

189
00:15:58,725 --> 00:15:59,993
- Well, those drops will help.

190
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:02,129
But tell me something.

191
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,363
Did the experts make anything

192
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:04,998
out of this mud on the carpet?

193
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:06,166
- Oh, they saw it, sure.

194
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,334
Figured it was tracked in

195
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,901
from somewhere
 around the building.

196
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:12,105
It's damp down here in these
canals, a lot of mud and water.

197
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,973
- Did they find any
 footprints or impressions?

198
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,508
- Hmm, I don't think so.

199
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,644
They couldn't tell much from
 the mud one way or another.

200
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:21,014
A little odd, I guess, but
 nothing too remarkable.

201
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,749
Now look, Mr. Connors,

202
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,584
I'm not going to arrest you.

203
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:26,753
But I want you to
 stop prowling around.

204
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,621
This area is off limits

205
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,590
until the investigation is over.

206
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,092
Do you understand?

207
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:33,726
- I do, and thank you.

208
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,462
I'm sorry I caused
 you any trouble.

209
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,705
- What a find.

210
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:57,984
- Hello?

211
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:08,861
- Wow!

212
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:13,366
A lot of stuff you got here.

213
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,603
- Where did you get
 this substance, Wayne?

214
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:17,970
- In Venice.

215
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,239
In fact, I found it
 over in the canal area

216
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,474
where that couple
 was murdered, why?

217
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:24,877
- Mainly 'cause it's like
 nothing I've ever seen before.

218
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,747
It seems to be protoplasmic,

219
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,416
and what you've brought me is,

220
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,685
and I'm only guessing,
 some kind of exoskeleton.

221
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,022
It is organic there's
 no doubt about that,

222
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:38,825
but it's also inorganic.

223
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,460
- So it's not mud?

224
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,994
- This stuff
 intrigues me though.

225
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,331
I'll keep it around and
make some further tests.

226
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,032
Maybe something will surface.

227
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:47,834
- Well, many thanks, Dr. John.

228
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,336
- You just give me a day or two,

229
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:52,172
and the mad doctor will come
 up with something.

230
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:53,005
- Oh, boy.

231
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:05,352
Come in.

232
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:06,786
- It's locked.

233
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,121
- Don't come in.

234
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,424
Here don't you move
 till I get back.

235
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,864
Hi, Dr. John, how are you?

236
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,434
- Hi, Dr. John.
- Hi, Jeff.

237
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,403
- Pull up a chair.

238
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:24,971
- Let's see.

239
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:29,142
- So, how you doing?

240
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:30,443
- Oh, I'm just fine.

241
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,712
I'm even better after
 this last move here.

242
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,348
Hmm, you're dead, Wayne.

243
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,017
- It's compulsive she
 cheats all the time.

244
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:40,253
If I didn't let her one once
 in a while, she'd never play.

245
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,389
- Can I get you a
 beer or something?

246
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:43,623
- Yeah, I'd love one.

247
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,430
- Well, I take it you've
come up with something

248
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,931
and in only two days.

249
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:55,034
- Uh-huh, and this
 is straight science fiction.

250
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:57,637
- So let's hear it.

251
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:00,407
- Well, first of all,

252
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:05,645
that substance that you brought
me was slightly radioactive.

253
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,248
Now not dangerously so,

254
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:10,550
but it does register high.

255
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,986
- That eternal stimulus
you were talking about.

256
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,622
- Now listen to this.

257
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,690
About 20 years ago,

258
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,060
a nuclear reactor at the
 experimental test facility

259
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,331
at Lake Sherwin,
Wisconsin was discovered

260
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,899
to be leaking an
 infinitesimal amount

261
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,902
of radioactive
byproduct into the lake.

262
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,771
This instillation, by the
 way, is the forerunner

263
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,573
of our modern day
 nuclear power plant,

264
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:36,376
like the one two miles
 down the coast here.

265
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:37,977
- What does this got to
do with the mud I found?

266
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,246
- Well, now stay with me.

267
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:42,215
This is the background
 phase of a two-story.

268
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:44,984
Along with the report
 on the nuclear litter

269
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:49,322
was another report damn near
 hidden and virtually ignored.

270
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:51,190
It told of the effects
 the spill had on

271
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,394
a certain stagnant
 lagoon adjoining Sherwin.

272
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:57,063
It seems that the
 silt in the lagoon

273
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,566
had picked up a bit
 of the radioactivity

274
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:02,001
and had become
 extremely absorptive.

275
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,371
The bacteria, the algae,

276
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,072
and even some of
 the more advanced

277
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,441
primitive life forms
 living in the lagoon.

278
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:10,209
- I am totally
 lost at this point.

279
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,644
- Well, now you won't be.

280
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:14,146
According to the two scientists
that discovered this silt

281
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,750
it had literally involved,
 for lack of a better word,

282
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,320
into a form of
protoplasm that took on

283
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,755
the characteristics of
 whatever it absorbed

284
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:25,157
and mutated into something
 totally different.

285
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,128
Scientists named this
 organic mud, Slithis.

286
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,603
- Why?

287
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:37,970
- For the same reason your
 parents named you Jeff.

288
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,406
Who knows?

289
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,073
At any rate what should've
 been the discovery

290
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,810
of the century went
 virtually unnoticed.

291
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,046
Locked up tighter than a
 drum because of AEC's fear

292
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:49,782
that notoriety over
this Slithis would cause

293
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:52,352
an uproar over the nuclear leak,

294
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,920
which undoubtedly it would have.

295
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,225
- That's a story, John.

296
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:02,094
- But you ain't heard
 the best part yet.

297
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:02,929
- There's more.

298
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:06,232
- One of the scientists
 who originally discovered

299
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:09,902
this Slithis is now working
 for Crest Oil Company.

300
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:12,238
Apparently, the idea
 of using radiation

301
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:14,607
to create new life
 stuck with him.

302
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,109
- There's a bit of the
 Frankenstein in all of us.

303
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,345
- Exactly.

304
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:20,112
So he convinced the
 big shots at Crest

305
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,814
to fund his experiments.

306
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:25,418
He maintained that in
 creating instant life

307
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:28,855
he was also creating the
ingredients necessary

308
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:32,058
for the formation of
 natural petroleum.

309
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:33,826
- Oh, sure by combining
organic matter,

310
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,227
a little bit of bacteria,

311
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,729
and substituting the
 pressure of a million years

312
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:39,231
of environmental change with
 a dose of radioactivity.

313
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:40,333
- To get to the point,

314
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:46,439
it appears that substance
 that you brought me

315
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:49,041
is something very
similar to the Slithis.

316
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:54,246
A freak combination of
 natural radioactivity

317
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:57,850
and the elements that science
 has not be able to duplicate.

318
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,489
- Who's the scientist
 that's been working for Crest?

319
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,057
- Oh, right Erin
 Burrick is his name,

320
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,460
and I believe he lives
 somewhere in the Malibu hills

321
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,562
if my sources are correct.

322
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:12,865
- Didn't you say that
 there is some other scientist?

323
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:16,803
- Unfortunately, he overdosed
 on radiation a few years ago

324
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:18,805
at the Brown Ferry
 nuke in Alabama.

325
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,774
It's a hazardous line of work.

326
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,277
Goodnight, Jeff.

327
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,112
- Goodnight Dr. John.

328
00:22:26,112 --> 00:22:28,681
- Oh, and Wayne.
- Hmm?

329
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:30,683
- Let me know if you
 decide to pursue this.

330
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,820
I sense your interest,
and I feel the same way.

331
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,088
- You'll be the first
 to know, and thanks.

332
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:36,923
- Mm-hmm.

333
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:47,934
- Deadly stuff
 that radioactivity.

334
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,604
- Wayne, you were
 handling that dirt.

335
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:52,872
- That Slithis.

336
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,141
You heard Dr. John say
 it wasn't dangerous.

337
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:59,378
- Well, I heard Dr. John
say a lot of things,

338
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,313
and it's all totally ridiculous.

339
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:03,750
I don't understand
 very much of this.

340
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,652
But just I want you
 to stay out of it.

341
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,522
You've satisfied your
 journalist curiosity now,

342
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:10,590
so leave it be.

343
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,527
- Honey, listen.

344
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,898
I don't understand it either.

345
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,568
But I know there's
something going on here.

346
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,102
And if the police think
this is the work of some

347
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:25,304
bizarre cultist with all
 that mutilation business,

348
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:26,906
well they're way off base.

349
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,340
There's a big story here.

350
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,011
It's just the spot for
a freelancer to step in

351
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:34,046
and make himself an
 overnight reputation.

352
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,748
- You got a great job
 at the high school.

353
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,817
Why can't you just be satisfied?

354
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:40,887
- Because I find myself hating
 it more and more every day.

355
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:42,655
It's okay for now.

356
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,757
But I want more than that.

357
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,226
This Slithis thing could
 be the perfect opportunity.

358
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:51,498
- Okay, if you wanna mess
 around with radioactivity

359
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:54,834
and cultists, you go right
 ahead and you have fun,

360
00:23:54,834 --> 00:23:57,403
but just don't you dare
mention it around me.

361
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:00,406
Move.

362
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,440
- Hey, Bunk, man.

363
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,242
We need some bread.

364
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:37,944
- I got some bread.

365
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:38,811
I got some bread.

366
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,748
What I gotta do is take a leak.

367
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:48,020
You crapped your pants?
- No, I just farted.

368
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,422
- You crapped your
pants again, god dammit.

369
00:24:58,565 --> 00:25:00,700
- Hey, man, you're a mess.

370
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:04,837
- Sure, man, I'm high,

371
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,273
higher than these
 goddamn buildings,

372
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:09,175
higher than the
 price of the wine.

373
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:48,147
Preston, you snot rag.

374
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:48,981
Get up.

375
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:55,588
Wake up, man.

376
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,936
Australia wasn't shit.

377
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,773
It didn't mean
 nothing after Nam.

378
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:16,342
All the whores
 were just the same.

379
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,145
Why shouldn't they be?

380
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:20,246
They were just whores.

381
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:28,788
Dammit.

382
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:33,425
Goddamn it.

383
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:38,264
But you ain't so smart, buddy.

384
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:41,300
Of course, I got more.

385
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,002
I've got it hidden
 right up there.

386
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:49,969
Gotcha, man!

387
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:14,526
What's he doin'
 swimming in there?

388
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:20,199
Hey, man, ain't you cold?

389
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:24,670
That dude needs some wine.

390
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:32,544
Hey, man.

391
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,846
Want some wine?

392
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,719
Buddy, you need some antifreeze.

393
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:46,859
Hey, man.

394
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:49,328
Hey.

395
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:11,884
- In another
 shocking Venice mutilations,

396
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:14,720
Kristen Darnel, a
32-year old stewardess,

397
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,322
was violently
 murdered last night

398
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:18,424
in her Rondo Court apartment.

399
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:20,993
Neighbors report of hearing
 nothing out of the ordinary

400
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:23,295
around two o'clock the time
 that the police experts

401
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:25,164
believe the murder took place.

402
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:27,066
This latest killing
 brings to three

403
00:29:27,066 --> 00:29:28,667
the total number
 of Venice residents

404
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:31,170
murdered in the last nine days.

405
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,572
This in addition to
reports of numerous dogs

406
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,174
and other house pets
 in the area slain

407
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:37,676
in a similar
 ritualistic fashion.

408
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:41,647
Even the area transients
are banding together

409
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,515
hoping for strength in numbers.

410
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,218
The local street people,
 normally known to be loaners,

411
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:49,088
have begun setting up a
 network of protected shelters

412
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:50,923
in safe areas.

413
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:53,759
- Sure we're
 scared, damn scared.

414
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:54,994
Why not?

415
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:56,896
Most of us ain't got no
place to hide anyway,

416
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:58,330
and the cops ain't
 gonna bust their butts

417
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,765
trying to protect us.

418
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:02,401
I sleep sometimes in the
 john down there by the beach.

419
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:05,137
Them stalls ain't got no
locks on 'em, you know.

420
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,839
- The police
in a attempt to prove

421
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,708
their human
 sacrifice/death cult theory

422
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:11,844
have questioned many
 of the various sects,

423
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:14,513
unconventional social
 and religion groups,

424
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:16,815
which abound in the Venice area.

425
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,218
According to police spokesman
 Commander Philip Reed.

426
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:22,922
- With the additional personal
 assigned to this case,

427
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:25,491
we feel that we can
 successfully handle

428
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:27,793
any threat to the Venice area.

429
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:30,596
Our investigation
 is well underway,

430
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:33,399
and we have several
 important clues.

431
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:37,303
We are following up these
 leads as fast as possible.

432
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:39,671
- Despite police
 reassurances however,

433
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,108
Venice residents are
 bordering on panic.

434
00:30:42,108 --> 00:30:45,111
Streets are deserted, houses
 have become fortresses,

435
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:49,148
and the smell of fear hangs
 like a stench over the canals.

436
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:00,586
- What are you doin'?

437
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:04,756
- Hi.

438
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,925
- What are you doin' here?

439
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:08,894
- Just looking around.

440
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:11,230
Why?

441
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,431
This your camp?

442
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,300
- Yeah, that's right
 this is my camp.

443
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:16,802
Everything's here is mine, man.

444
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:21,140
- Great, look I'm sorry I
thought the area was abandoned.

445
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,308
- Well, you were wrong.

446
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,244
- Yeah, I can see that now.

447
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:31,217
You around here last night?

448
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:33,685
- Why, what's it to you?

449
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,322
- There was some trouble a
 few blocks down the canal.

450
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,296
- Well, I didn't hear
 nothin', man, not a sound.

451
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:51,137
- Look, pal.

452
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:54,406
How you wanna handle
your trip is up to you.

453
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:57,309
But we're talking about some
 very nasty murders here.

454
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,377
If you didn't see what happened,

455
00:32:58,377 --> 00:32:59,945
maybe whoever was with you did.

456
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:05,317
Now you can talk to me

457
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,119
or you can talk to the police.

458
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:09,388
- I don't need the cops, man.

459
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:11,757
I get hassled enough by
 the damn kids around here.

460
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:13,125
They're always ripping me off.

461
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:15,761
No, I wasn't alone.

462
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:17,129
Another guy was over, okay?

463
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:19,865
- What's his name?

464
00:33:19,865 --> 00:33:20,699
- It was a dude named Bunky.

465
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,770
- Yeah.
 - That's it Bunky.

466
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,173
He hangs out at the Plaza
 by the bike path, man.

467
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,442
We was just juicing
 and shootin' the shit.

468
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:32,578
I passed out.

469
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,047
I woke up he was gone.

470
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:37,949
It's okay though, man.

471
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,119
He didn't have nothin' to do
 with that scene up the street.

472
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,720
- Yeah, I'm sure of that.

473
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,654
But it looks like you two guys

474
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:44,090
are the only possible witnesses.

475
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,924
If you were out cold,

476
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:48,894
then it must have been
Bunky who saw something.

477
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:49,828
What does he look like?

478
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:54,533
- He's about 5'6, 5'7, I guess.

479
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:55,367
- How old?

480
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:57,803
- About my age, 24, 25.

481
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:04,676
- Okay, my name's
 Wayne, by the way.

482
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,378
- Yeah, Preston, man.

483
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,183
- Okay, Preston.

484
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:13,985
Thanks.

485
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:14,920
I'll be seeing you.

486
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:18,257
- Hey, man.

487
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:23,462
If you see Bunky, tell him
 he left his stuff here, man.

488
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,598
I don't dig messes.

489
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:46,712
- Say, uh.

490
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:49,114
I'm looking for a friend,

491
00:35:49,114 --> 00:35:51,116
actually a friend of a
 friend, name is Bunky?

492
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:54,186
- Uh-huh.

493
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:58,190
What do you want with Bunky?

494
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,491
- Personal business,

495
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,627
to tell him he left
some stuff with Preston.

496
00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:04,396
- Good Samaritan, huh?

497
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:09,968
Well, thank you, neighbor
 we'll tell him about Preston,

498
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:12,271
and let him know
 that you want to chat

499
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:14,806
with him about some
 personal business.

500
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:17,743
What's your name, man?

501
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,379
- Look I just wanna talk
to Bunky where is he?

502
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:23,549
- Hey, what's it worth
to you, Good Samaritan?

503
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,185
- Oh, about a half a
 gallon of decent wine.

504
00:36:29,455 --> 00:36:30,289
- Deal.

505
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,693
Bunky's over at Rosa's crib,

506
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,596
Cooney's Boarding
 House 223 Driftwood.

507
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:43,869
I don't think he's
feeling too good today.

508
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:45,704
So Rosa let him hang
 out for a while.

509
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:50,876
And a bottle of wine's
about five bucks worth.

510
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,011
Inflation, you understand?

511
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:00,018
- Here you are.

512
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:01,320
- Thanks.

513
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,554
Good Samaritan.

514
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:05,557
Alright, man.

515
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:09,261
All right.

516
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:40,859
- Yeah.

517
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:42,828
- Bunky?

518
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,731
I'm a friend of Preston's.

519
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:49,401
I got something he
 asked me to bring you.

520
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:01,413
- What do you got?

521
00:38:01,413 --> 00:38:03,815
- Information.

522
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:04,983
Can I come in?

523
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,120
- Why not?

524
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,689
Maybe I could use some company.

525
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:48,259
- Preston, uh,

526
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:50,796
asked me to tell
 you that you left

527
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:53,331
some of your goods at
 his place last night.

528
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,834
- Last night?

529
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:57,703
- That's right.

530
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:00,271
After he passed out

531
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:04,242
and you saw whatever
 it was you saw.

532
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:07,312
- How do you know
 about that, Ace?

533
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:11,116
- Well, I don't, not exactly.

534
00:39:12,884 --> 00:39:13,719
But,

535
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:20,091
you did see something.

536
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,027
What was it?

537
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:29,167
- Man, I don't know
 what the hell I saw.

538
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,604
It looked like a big
 slimy goddamn lizard,

539
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,607
something that crawled
 out of a sewer.

540
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:37,142
Mouth like a sucker fish.

541
00:39:42,914 --> 00:39:44,282
Maybe I didn't see nothin'.

542
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,418
I was drinking yesterday.

543
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:47,986
I don't know always
 remember right.

544
00:39:47,986 --> 00:39:49,588
- Nah, Bunky, you saw something.

545
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,628
- I saw something all right.

546
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:01,066
I cut my hand when I
 fell and my bottle broke.

547
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,434
This I know is real.

548
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:04,436
Seven stitches at
 the free clinic.

549
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:06,538
- Bunky, will you come with me

550
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:07,939
and tell this to the police?

551
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,241
- The cops?

552
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,343
You snapping.

553
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:14,412
Them I got no use for.

554
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:17,849
Besides they wanna
 talk to me about a

555
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:20,452
condo break in up
 on the Peninsula.

556
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:22,153
Nah, no authorities,
 man, no way.

557
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:25,491
If they should suddenly find me,

558
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:28,193
I didn't see a damn thing
 'cause I was here all night.

559
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,430
You better split, man.

560
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,571
- Thank you, Doctor,
 I certainly appreciate

561
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:40,572
you taking the time.

562
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:42,841
Right 8:30 will be fine.

563
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,076
See you then.

564
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:45,877
Bye.

565
00:40:49,014 --> 00:40:50,248
Hey, Jeff.

566
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:51,783
That was our man Burrick.

567
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,119
He sounds a little odd, but
 he seems friendly enough.

568
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,688
I can meet him at his
place in Malibu at 8:30.

569
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:57,489
Wanna go?

570
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,891
- Yes, I'll go.

571
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:09,167
- Near the marina there is a

572
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:12,303
medium-sized nuclear
 energy facility

573
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,072
just a mile or so
 down the coast.

574
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:18,309
Now it is not inconceivable
 that this facility

575
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,612
may have leaked some
 radioactive material.

576
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,683
Of course, the radioactivity
 is the catalytic ingredient

577
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:26,518
that causes the abiogenesis.

578
00:41:27,653 --> 00:41:29,788
If you're familiar
 with my work, however

579
00:41:29,788 --> 00:41:31,489
you'll know that
 I've had no success

580
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,325
in creating Slithis under
 laboratory conditions.

581
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,394
- I thought...

582
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:40,031
What if the Slithis had evolved

583
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,501
beyond the point of
your initial discovery?

584
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,072
What if it evolved into
a creature so complex

585
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:50,275
that it sought out the nutrition
necessary to keep it alive?

586
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:55,380
- Evolved from the
 simple life form

587
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,551
that we discovered into
something more complex?

588
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:03,922
I certainly wouldn't say
that it wasn't possible.

589
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:07,492
- But what would
 cause it to change?

590
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:11,797
- Why the
radioactivity, my dear.

591
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:14,766
It has the most
 astounding affect

592
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:18,236
on all living organisms.

593
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,142
We found that the Slithis

594
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:26,111
would incorporation
 the characteristics

595
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:27,813
of anything it absorbed.

596
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,348
Now given the proper nutrients,

597
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:33,018
the growth potential
 would be endless.

598
00:42:33,018 --> 00:42:35,654
I have no idea what shape

599
00:42:35,654 --> 00:42:39,591
or form this growth
 would eventually take.

600
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:40,859
- In other words, the form which

601
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,028
most suited its need to survive.

602
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:45,731
- The job
 of an imagination

603
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:48,600
more fertile than my own.

604
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,102
- Doctor, to prove any this?

605
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:52,370
- You would first find

606
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,873
the source of the radioactivity.

607
00:42:54,873 --> 00:42:58,143
Now if it is the
nuclear energy facility,

608
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:00,445
security's tight, and
 they'll admit to nothing.

609
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,916
Through analysis of the soil,
 off the shore of the plant,

610
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:09,154
however, one could
 accurately determine

611
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:12,858
such basic elements in an
 investigation of this nature.

612
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:16,227
- Howdy, Captain,
 can I help you?

613
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:18,897
- Yeah, I'm looking
 for Chris Alexander.

614
00:43:18,897 --> 00:43:20,598
- Oh, my nephew.

615
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,533
I hope there's no problems.

616
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,670
- I just wanna charter his
 boat for an hour that's all.

617
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:26,271
- Oh, he's on the
 boat in the back.

618
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:27,505
You come right
 through this opening,

619
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:29,775
you'll find him up
 on the top here.

620
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:31,209
- Thank you.
 - Sure thing.

621
00:43:47,192 --> 00:43:48,026
- Chris.

622
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:55,533
- What can I do for you?

623
00:43:57,803 --> 00:43:58,603
Up here.

624
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:04,042
Like the spirit of the sea, eh?

625
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:06,244
More often heard than seen.

626
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:08,646
Again, I ask what
 can I do for you?

627
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:13,819
- I'm Wayne Connors I'm a
 friend of Peter Tanakas.

628
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:18,189
I need the services of
 a diver with a boat,

629
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:19,925
and he said you
 might be interested.

630
00:44:19,925 --> 00:44:21,459
And you might give me
 a break on the price.

631
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:22,460
It's a small job.

632
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:27,498
- I might be interested.

633
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,967
How small?

634
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:30,836
- Just the few hours
 I need some soil samples

635
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:33,271
taken off the shore of
 the Imperial Energy Plant.

636
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:35,240
- I'll come down.

637
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:48,519
So, my main man Peter is
watching out for me, eh?

638
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,556
Christopher Columbus
 Alexander at your service.

639
00:44:51,556 --> 00:44:53,358
- Glad to meet you.

640
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:55,426
- Good, let's shake
 like you white folks.

641
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:56,661
None of that tricky nigger shit.

642
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:58,229
It takes too long.

643
00:44:58,229 --> 00:44:59,064
Now then,

644
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,167
what did you have in
 mind for the dive?

645
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:03,068
- Well, I don't
know much about it,

646
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:04,903
but it's just routine.

647
00:45:04,903 --> 00:45:08,206
- Routine, just
 in, down, and out?

648
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,075
Are you with the Sierra
Club by any chance?

649
00:45:10,075 --> 00:45:12,510
- Oh, no, nothing like
 that see I'm a journalist.

650
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,845
I'm doing a series
 of articles on

651
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:15,513
California's changing coastline,

652
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:18,283
and I need some soil samples
 to back up a few theories.

653
00:45:18,283 --> 00:45:19,584
- It doesn't matter.

654
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:21,019
As long as I'm paid,

655
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:22,821
the reason for your
 tests make no difference.

656
00:45:24,122 --> 00:45:25,656
- How much will it cost me?

657
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:28,726
- Well, let's see since you
 are a friend of my man Peter

658
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,029
and I'm working for my
 uncle on an account,

659
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:33,164
how does 30 plus fuel sound?

660
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:35,500
- That sounds fair.

661
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,802
- It is.

662
00:45:36,802 --> 00:45:38,804
Tomorrow is my day of freedom.

663
00:45:38,804 --> 00:45:42,207
Meet me at the ocean side
 dock, number 22, at 10:00

664
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:44,175
and you can buy a
 few hours of my life.

665
00:45:46,945 --> 00:45:48,413
- You know I don't
 know how to take you.

666
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:51,216
- Be cool and maybe we'll learn
about one another together.

667
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,962
- How fast can
 this mini tug roll, Chris?

668
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:05,897
- Oh, about six knots.

669
00:46:05,897 --> 00:46:08,633
This boat wasn't built
 for comfort or speed.

670
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:11,269
Reliability is the watch
word on the Creation.

671
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,403
- Suits your needs, huh?

672
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:13,604
- There you go.

673
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,807
It totes my gear and
holds the fish I catch,

674
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,109
and the payments
 are right, I own it.

675
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,178
The only possession
 my family ever owned.

676
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:55,213
- I appreciate
 your helping me.

677
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:56,381
I wish I could tell you more,

678
00:46:56,381 --> 00:46:58,216
but I don't know anymore.

679
00:46:58,216 --> 00:46:59,885
- And what
 do I need to know?

680
00:46:59,885 --> 00:47:01,920
You want some soil
 and water samples.

681
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,354
You're paying for the fuel.

682
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:04,789
I'm just along for the dive.

683
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:13,164
- Go in as
 far as you have to.

684
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,699
Closer to the shore the better.

685
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:15,633
- I can go all the way

686
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:16,968
to the power plant if you want.

687
00:47:18,103 --> 00:47:20,305
- Well, maybe halfway.

688
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:34,986
- You've got
 lots of tubes there.

689
00:47:34,986 --> 00:47:37,755
I'll just bring you samples
 from three or four areas.

690
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:39,424
You won't need too
 many because the floor

691
00:47:39,424 --> 00:47:41,392
hits its deepest
 point pretty quick.

692
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:43,461
Then levels for a long way out.

693
00:47:43,461 --> 00:47:45,796
- Alright, good you
bring 'em up and I'll mark 'em.

694
00:48:28,673 --> 00:48:30,908
Alright, this should do it.

695
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:41,953
- I'm waterlogged to the bone.

696
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:44,222
Man it is dark down there.

697
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:45,656
- You didn't see anything

698
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:46,824
out of the ordinary
 down there did you?

699
00:48:46,824 --> 00:48:49,160
- Nah, not even any fish,

700
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,828
which are odd because
 they usually like

701
00:48:50,828 --> 00:48:53,298
the warm waters off
 these power plants.

702
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:54,265
- Oh.

703
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,533
- Yeah.

704
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:58,303
Well, at least I found a
spot not to go fishing.

705
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:01,172
Let me dry off and
 we'll head for home.

706
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:08,879
- You sure, I only dropped
 the stuff off this morning

707
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,248
is why I'm asking.

708
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:12,183
Okay, it's fine with me.

709
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:14,152
Well, what about the water?

710
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:14,986
Right.

711
00:49:17,922 --> 00:49:20,258
Great I'll be by to
 see you then tomorrow.

712
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,860
Yeah, bye.

713
00:49:24,062 --> 00:49:24,895
- Well?

714
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:28,199
- Yes and no.

715
00:49:30,668 --> 00:49:32,203
There was Slithis
 in the water samples

716
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:34,072
from about 20 yards out.

717
00:49:34,072 --> 00:49:37,075
Not exactly like the
 first droppings I
 gave him but similar.

718
00:49:38,443 --> 00:49:41,279
None of the water samples
showed any radioactivity though.

719
00:49:42,513 --> 00:49:44,149
- Is that what you expected?

720
00:49:44,149 --> 00:49:46,051
- I would've confirmed
 a current leak.

721
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:49,920
See the Slithis means that
 there was a leak sometime.

722
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,590
Impossible to determine when
 though according to Dr. John.

723
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,959
- Wayne, I just can't imagine

724
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:56,594
how you're gonna
convince anybody

725
00:49:56,594 --> 00:49:59,297
that there's a slime
 creature feasting

726
00:49:59,297 --> 00:50:01,132
on the residents of Venice.

727
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:04,402
I love you very, very much,

728
00:50:04,402 --> 00:50:06,271
and I don't believe
 a word of it.

729
00:50:09,074 --> 00:50:11,976
- Well, just wait till
 I suggest the idea

730
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:13,544
to the police tomorrow morning.

731
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:21,619
- So, you weren't too
 surprised when the police

732
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:23,621
didn't think much
 of your theory, huh?

733
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:25,456
- Yeah, but I had
 to give it a shot.

734
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:27,692
The aggregation was that
Lieutenant Prentiss.

735
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,026
Says he's in charge
 of a 120 men.

736
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,895
He shouldn't be in
 charge of pencils.

737
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,564
- Well, so the cops
 aren't interested.

738
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:34,665
What's your next step?

739
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:36,967
- Well, I got an idea.

740
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:39,770
Apparently, the
creature moves on land,

741
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,772
but primarily it's a
 water animal, right?

742
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:46,311
So, what if we cut off the
 only access to the canals?

743
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:51,048
- In theory, no
 more Venice murders.

744
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,650
- Right, the damn thing
would go on out looking

745
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,720
for more food and hopefully
 go right on out to sea.

746
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,489
- So how do you plan
to close off the canal?

747
00:50:58,489 --> 00:50:59,857
- Well, the water
 level of the canals

748
00:50:59,857 --> 00:51:01,392
is determined by the tides.

749
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:04,028
High tide lots of water, low
 tide and the canals are dry.

750
00:51:04,028 --> 00:51:06,897
So we wait for low tide, and
 then close off the water lock

751
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,499
at the mouth of the grand canal.

752
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:09,734
Deprived of that root,

753
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:11,536
the creature can't get
 to the upper canals.

754
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:13,138
- Somebody's gonna
 raise holy hell

755
00:51:13,138 --> 00:51:14,405
when they notice that the water

756
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,441
isn't coming back
 in with the tide.

757
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:17,375
Now wait a minute
 what do you mean

758
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,076
we close off the water lock?

759
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,748
You know this is
 probably illegal.

760
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:26,217
- Yeah, this is gonna be
tougher than I thought.

761
00:51:26,217 --> 00:51:27,918
It's two locks and
 a lot of fence.

762
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:33,324
A key where did you get a key?

763
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:34,359
- An old college friend of mine

764
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:36,261
is a resident oceanologist here.

765
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:39,997
All it takes is a
phone call.

766
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:29,514
- Okay, with any luck at all

767
00:52:29,514 --> 00:52:31,416
no one will notice
 this until tomorrow,

768
00:52:31,416 --> 00:52:33,751
and we'll see what
 happens tonight.

769
00:52:33,751 --> 00:52:36,554
- Three, two, one.

770
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:38,289
- You got a race.

771
00:52:47,064 --> 00:52:48,966
Changing direction.

772
00:52:57,308 --> 00:52:59,410
Reason to get a
 $50 turtle there.

773
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:01,145
Gary's gonna bring
 out a no-time winner

774
00:53:01,145 --> 00:53:03,047
by names of Legs Magert.

775
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:06,317
That's has an almost
 racing win of zip.

776
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:10,555
- Five, four,
 three, two, one.

777
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:12,590
- The gate is up!, man, look!

778
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:15,526
Many of them fishing
 out the gate.

779
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:16,461
Look at this!

780
00:53:18,062 --> 00:53:20,831
The Magician's
 going to the line!

781
00:53:21,999 --> 00:53:25,436
The Magician in a total
finish for the event!

782
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:29,407
The Magician wraps
 it up, racing!

783
00:53:29,407 --> 00:53:30,641
These are the monsters.

784
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:31,842
These are the ones you
 gotta watch out for.

785
00:53:31,842 --> 00:53:33,478
They've been known
 to attack spectators.

786
00:53:33,478 --> 00:53:36,046
For the beginner's racing
 Sheryl's gonna bring out Moe.

787
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,015
- Come on
 let's get out of here.

788
00:53:38,015 --> 00:53:40,918
- It's
 a maiden entry.

789
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:46,424
The winner!

790
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:49,527
The winner in a time
 of 22 seconds flat,

791
00:53:49,527 --> 00:53:52,330
Richards, Richards breeding.

792
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:07,812
- That place
was like a zoo tonight.

793
00:54:07,812 --> 00:54:09,380
A lot crazier than usual.

794
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,248
- I know I've
 never seen anything like it.

795
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,617
- So now I'm gonna
show you something else

796
00:54:12,617 --> 00:54:14,118
you've never seen before.

797
00:54:14,118 --> 00:54:16,987
The Marina del Rey from
 the rear deck of my boat.

798
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:17,888
- Sounds like fun.

799
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:21,626
- Who was the girl
 you were with tonight?

800
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:22,860
- Oh, that's my cousin.

801
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,195
That's who I'm staying
with while I'm out here.

802
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:27,832
- Yeah, you said you
were visiting from, uh?

803
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:31,769
- Souska, North
Dakota, population 611.

804
00:54:34,339 --> 00:54:35,906
- Alright, the big time, huh?

805
00:54:37,475 --> 00:54:39,477
You know I saw you get
 checked three times tonight,

806
00:54:39,477 --> 00:54:42,146
so, I guess, you're
 old enough to party.

807
00:54:42,146 --> 00:54:44,815
But you do look younger.

808
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:47,117
- Oh, would it make a
 difference if I were?

809
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,588
- Not really, depending
on how much though.

810
00:54:50,588 --> 00:54:52,857
- Oh, back home everyone has ID.

811
00:54:52,857 --> 00:54:55,560
I'm only 18, but I
don't act like it, do I?

812
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,027
- No, absolutely not.

813
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:59,464
You come across much
 older, at least 20,

814
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:02,467
and I'm an instant
 dirty old man.

815
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:07,972
So what do you do in
 Souska, North Dakota?

816
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:10,207
What does anybody do in
Souska, North Dakota?

817
00:55:11,342 --> 00:55:12,877
- Well, practically
 everyone leaves.

818
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:14,211
That's what I'm about to do.

819
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:15,713
That's why I'm out here now.

820
00:55:15,713 --> 00:55:18,549
I'm just getting
things together.

821
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:20,250
'Cause back home the
 only work is in the

822
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,986
ball bearing factories.

823
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:23,988
Souska's famous for
 its ball bearings.

824
00:55:25,222 --> 00:55:26,391
- I can't believe it.

825
00:55:26,391 --> 00:55:29,326
- Well, it's true
Souska's a factory town.

826
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,628
- And so what are you
 gonna do out here?

827
00:55:30,628 --> 00:55:32,663
- I don't know I
 really don't care.

828
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,499
It's just different,
 it's exciting.

829
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:35,833
- And it's not Souska, right?

830
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:37,101
- Right.
 - Yeah, right.

831
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:41,205
- So how long have
 you lived on a boat?

832
00:55:41,205 --> 00:55:44,008
- Oh, a couple of years now.

833
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:46,777
But I'm getting
 the old bug again,

834
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:50,147
and I'll be doing some more
 travelling pretty soon.

835
00:55:50,147 --> 00:55:53,217
- My cousin and I were
 in Hawaii last summer.

836
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:54,051
- Hmm.

837
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,888
You know you are
 really nice looking

838
00:55:57,888 --> 00:56:01,025
with such a nice tight body.

839
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,227
- Well, I played
a lot in school,

840
00:56:03,227 --> 00:56:04,995
you know sports and things.

841
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:06,931
- Yeah, that too.

842
00:56:39,163 --> 00:56:41,466
Hey, listen I gotta
 go to the john,

843
00:56:41,466 --> 00:56:42,733
so why don't you go
 on out onto the boat.

844
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,201
Maybe pour us a
 little wine, huh?

845
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:46,303
- Alright, well,
which one is it?

846
00:56:46,303 --> 00:56:48,639
- Big cruiser, see
 end of the dock.

847
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,141
The light are on and the
 cabin door should be open.

848
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,376
- Okay.
- Okay.

849
00:58:27,471 --> 00:58:28,873
- Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

850
00:58:28,873 --> 00:58:30,107
I thought it was Doug.

851
00:58:30,107 --> 00:58:32,376
I was waiting, and
 I heard his car.

852
00:58:32,376 --> 00:58:33,611
I'm really sorry.

853
00:58:33,611 --> 00:58:35,980
- It's alright you
 just scared me.

854
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,816
- My name is Rex I live
 in the building next door.

855
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:39,984
- Hi, I'm Jennifer.

856
00:58:39,984 --> 00:58:40,818
- Okay.

857
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:45,590
- Great a party, huh?

858
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,424
What's all the commotion?

859
00:58:47,424 --> 00:58:49,760
- Huh, nothing much
 I was waiting for you

860
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,929
and watching a
 little TV down below,

861
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:54,131
and I kind of caught
Jennifer here off guard.

862
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:55,365
- Yeah, well I'll bet.

863
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,101
Just leaving though
 weren't you, Rex?

864
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:59,604
- Yeah, I guess I was.

865
00:58:59,604 --> 00:59:00,838
Nice meeting you Jennifer,

866
00:59:00,838 --> 00:59:03,207
and again I apologize
 for the shock, bye.

867
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:05,275
- It's all right it
 was nice meeting you.

868
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,817
- Rex is a good guy, but
he hangs around a lot.

869
00:59:12,817 --> 00:59:15,219
Just a frustrated
 boat owner, I guess.

870
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:16,420
Let's go below.
- Okay.

871
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,697
It's a nice place to live.

872
00:59:26,697 --> 00:59:29,099
- Yeah, I try to make it
 as comfortable as possible.

873
00:59:45,883 --> 00:59:47,517
And I am sorry about Rex.

874
00:59:47,517 --> 00:59:50,554
I mean, I was surprised
as you must have been.

875
00:59:50,554 --> 00:59:52,990
- Well, you know good
 fences make good neighbors

876
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,192
or at least that's the way
 Robert Frost felt about it.

877
00:59:55,192 --> 00:59:58,195
- And he was right at least
 where Rex is concerned.

878
00:59:58,195 --> 00:59:59,296
How about that wine?

879
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:00,297
- Hmm, that'd be great.

880
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:01,832
- Okay.

881
01:00:01,832 --> 01:00:04,935
Hit the music, okay?
 - Okay.

882
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:38,869
Thank you.
 - Red wine

883
01:00:38,869 --> 01:00:40,337
from chilled glasses,

884
01:00:41,806 --> 01:00:43,340
and with a flick of the switch,

885
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:46,777
instant atmosphere.

886
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,279
To us.

887
01:01:02,426 --> 01:01:04,128
What time is your curfew?

888
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:05,129
- Why would you ask that?

889
01:01:05,129 --> 01:01:06,130
- I was just wondering.

890
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:07,364
- Yeah, I'll bet.

891
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:13,838
Oh, yeah.

892
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:15,773
- You're tense?
- Cold.

893
01:01:16,807 --> 01:01:17,875
- Yeah, give me this.

894
01:01:19,243 --> 01:01:20,610
Turn around.

895
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:21,611
Turn around.

896
01:01:23,113 --> 01:01:24,348
Your tense up here.

897
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:28,152
And here can you feel this?

898
01:01:28,152 --> 01:01:29,787
- Oh, yeah, I can.

899
01:01:29,787 --> 01:01:30,821
- And down in here?

900
01:01:31,956 --> 01:01:32,790
- Yes.

901
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:44,101
- Come on let's go below.

902
01:01:44,101 --> 01:01:45,903
- No, I shouldn't.
 - Come on, come on.

903
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:59,349
- Hey, what was that?

904
01:01:59,349 --> 01:02:00,150
- That's nothing.

905
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:02,820
I'm moored at the
 end of the dock

906
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:05,389
and I catch the wave from
 every passing boat that all.

907
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:07,691
- Well, you know you
 left the cabin door open.

908
01:02:08,592 --> 01:02:10,094
I wish you'd lock it.

909
01:02:10,094 --> 01:02:11,628
I know it's silly but with
 your friend hanging around--

910
01:02:11,628 --> 01:02:13,864
- Hey, listen, listen, listen.

911
01:02:13,864 --> 01:02:16,066
If it'll make you comfortable,
 I'll do it all right.

912
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,567
I mean, I like my privacy too.

913
01:02:20,304 --> 01:02:25,042
Why don't you get naked
while I'm gone, alright?

914
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:25,876
- Okay.

915
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:44,995
- Doug?

916
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:50,367
Doug?

917
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:54,104
Doug?

918
01:04:21,025 --> 01:04:25,029
- Look I said no comment
and I mean no comments!

919
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:27,697
Come in.

920
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:30,834
Well?

921
01:04:30,834 --> 01:04:31,635
- Lieutenant, there's
 some guy named

922
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:33,070
Connors here to see you.

923
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:35,705
- Oh, yes, I know Connors,
 Brown, bring him in.

924
01:04:37,007 --> 01:04:37,841
- Connors.

925
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:42,446
- Well, very good, Brown.

926
01:04:42,446 --> 01:04:43,547
Hold all calls.

927
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,186
- Good evening, Lieutenant.

928
01:04:49,186 --> 01:04:51,321
- No, no it isn't.

929
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:53,690
It is an insidious evening

930
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,692
following a disastrous morning.

931
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,396
I suppose you've
 heard the latest?

932
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:00,931
- Mm-hmm, two more.

933
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:04,901
This time in the marina.

934
01:05:07,271 --> 01:05:08,672
That's why I'm here.

935
01:05:08,672 --> 01:05:12,476
- I assume that had something
 to do with your visit.

936
01:05:12,476 --> 01:05:15,579
- I know you don't think very
 much of my theory, Lieutenant.

937
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:16,613
But this time I've got evidence

938
01:05:16,613 --> 01:05:18,415
that's a bit more substantial.

939
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:20,084
- Well, get on with it, Connors.

940
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:22,019
- Last night's murders
took place in the marina

941
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:25,389
because I shut off the
creature's access to the canals.

942
01:05:25,389 --> 01:05:28,292
Yesterday afternoon I closed
 the lock at the marina jetty.

943
01:05:29,726 --> 01:05:31,928
- It's against the law to
 tamper with those locks.

944
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,663
You should've been arrested.

945
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:35,399
- But I wasn't.

946
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:36,733
Look I'm trying
 to help you people

947
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:38,702
stop this horrible business.

948
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:40,870
I've been doing the work your
 police officers haven't been

949
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,306
because they've been
too busy trying to prove

950
01:05:42,306 --> 01:05:44,541
this ridiculous
mutilation cult garbage!

951
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:45,909
- Alright, Connors.

952
01:05:45,909 --> 01:05:49,946
It's obvious that you
 are trying to help us.

953
01:05:51,748 --> 01:05:54,084
And if I were not dissatisfied

954
01:05:54,084 --> 01:05:56,053
with this mutilation
 theory myself,

955
01:05:57,487 --> 01:06:00,424
you would not be sitting
 in my office at this time.

956
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:05,695
But, I do not believe one word

957
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,531
of your slither story!

958
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,335
- Slithis.

959
01:06:12,236 --> 01:06:15,172
- Oh, pardon me, Slithis story.

960
01:06:18,275 --> 01:06:22,746
But, what I saw this afternoon

961
01:06:22,746 --> 01:06:24,414
it was a blood bath.

962
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:28,218
In the interest
 of public safety,

963
01:06:28,218 --> 01:06:30,720
I am willing to
 consider everything.

964
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:34,124
Therefore, I will have one
 of my police scientists

965
01:06:34,124 --> 01:06:35,825
talk even with you.

966
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:41,331
Sergeant, ask Risling
to come in for a moment.

967
01:06:43,767 --> 01:06:47,804
- So then this incredibly
 adaptable mutation

968
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:50,774
has involved into a
 humanoid creature.

969
01:06:52,209 --> 01:06:54,411
But Mr. Connors why is
 it murdering people?

970
01:06:55,245 --> 01:06:56,080
- Not murdering.

971
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,414
It's feeding on them.

972
01:06:57,414 --> 01:07:00,016
See it attacks and
eats whatever's around.

973
01:07:01,251 --> 01:07:02,452
Look, when I sampled the mud

974
01:07:02,452 --> 01:07:04,154
off the shore of
the power plant,

975
01:07:04,154 --> 01:07:06,556
my diver said he saw
 no sea life at all,

976
01:07:06,556 --> 01:07:08,192
no fish, nothing.

977
01:07:08,192 --> 01:07:09,726
It's stands to reason
 that the creature

978
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:11,528
has eatin' himself out
of his spawning grounds,

979
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,330
and he's moved on
 looking for food.

980
01:07:14,498 --> 01:07:15,999
Now it hit a good
 area in the canals,

981
01:07:15,999 --> 01:07:20,036
fish, dogs, people,
 so it returned.

982
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:22,306
Yesterday afternoon I cut
 off the creature's access

983
01:07:22,306 --> 01:07:24,341
to the canals and it
 moved on down the channel

984
01:07:24,341 --> 01:07:25,775
and onto one of the boats.

985
01:07:27,077 --> 01:07:28,745
Now maybe if there had
been water in the canal

986
01:07:28,745 --> 01:07:30,314
when we closed it off,
 the creature would've gone

987
01:07:30,314 --> 01:07:32,349
over the embankment and
 across the road I don't know.

988
01:07:32,349 --> 01:07:33,883
I don't believe we're
 dealing with anything

989
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,385
that's ever existed
 before, so there's no way

990
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:37,053
of predicting what
 it's going to do.

991
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,856
- Well, I'm not
 going to question the
 possibility of Slithis

992
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:42,559
because organic
 mud may well exist.

993
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,894
Although, it borders
 on a abiogenesis,

994
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,531
which was disproven by Louis
 Pasteur back in the 1800,

995
01:07:47,531 --> 01:07:48,998
but that's neither
 here nor there.

996
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:51,368
What I can't accept is the
 idea that this thing has been

997
01:07:51,368 --> 01:07:54,204
living off the coast all this
 time and no one's noticed it.

998
01:07:54,204 --> 01:07:55,038
- Risling.

999
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:57,374
The point is moot.

1000
01:08:00,544 --> 01:08:03,980
I have just finished chatting
 with the plant manager

1001
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:07,284
at the Imperial
Nuclear Energy station,

1002
01:08:07,284 --> 01:08:10,154
and he assures me
 that his facility

1003
01:08:10,154 --> 01:08:14,124
has not had any radioactive
 leak of any kind

1004
01:08:14,124 --> 01:08:17,894
since this plant was
 constructed in 1965!

1005
01:08:17,894 --> 01:08:20,664
- Of course, he did
 I told you he would.

1006
01:08:20,664 --> 01:08:23,233
Did you expect him to
 admit something like that!

1007
01:08:24,868 --> 01:08:27,971
- Unless Risling feels
 that some further

1008
01:08:27,971 --> 01:08:30,474
conversation would be
of a productive nature,

1009
01:08:30,474 --> 01:08:32,676
I believe we will
 close this subject.

1010
01:08:32,676 --> 01:08:34,211
Risling?

1011
01:08:34,211 --> 01:08:35,579
Very well.

1012
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:38,815
Mr. Connors, again I
 am going to thank you

1013
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:43,587
for your display
 of public spirit.

1014
01:08:43,587 --> 01:08:47,857
But I'm very busy, and my
 department is very busy!

1015
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:52,862
Risling will escort you
out for the last time!

1016
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:58,402
- Brother that is one
 crazy story, but who knows.

1017
01:08:58,402 --> 01:09:00,537
- Stranger things
have come to pass,

1018
01:09:00,537 --> 01:09:03,373
like the existence
 of Slithis itself.

1019
01:09:03,373 --> 01:09:05,041
- Well, actually two
 of my people fishing

1020
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:08,445
off the coast of Jamaica
 netted an ill-like creature

1021
01:09:08,445 --> 01:09:11,080
that the expert thought
extinct for centuries.

1022
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,617
In the sea all
 things are possible.

1023
01:09:13,617 --> 01:09:14,451
- Oh, really.

1024
01:09:15,352 --> 01:09:16,720
- But not probable.

1025
01:09:19,055 --> 01:09:21,024
I won't be the loan
 dissenter here.

1026
01:09:21,024 --> 01:09:23,460
Whatever you guys
decide is fine with me.

1027
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,362
- I never thought I'd hear it.

1028
01:09:25,362 --> 01:09:27,063
- Yes, I never
 thought I'd say it.

1029
01:09:28,064 --> 01:09:29,499
- Tell me something.

1030
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:31,768
If this Slithis does
 retain the traits you say,

1031
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:34,238
why won't it return
 to its spawning beds?

1032
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:35,772
- You mean the area
 we found the samples?

1033
01:09:35,772 --> 01:09:36,840
- Right.

1034
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,774
- John?
- Hey.

1035
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:39,008
While I am thinking of it.

1036
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,344
If there is a
 creature down there,

1037
01:09:40,344 --> 01:09:42,145
you might have gotten me eatin'.

1038
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,615
- It was a chance I had to take.

1039
01:09:45,615 --> 01:09:47,050
- White boy, please.

1040
01:09:48,452 --> 01:09:51,955
- Hey, Chris, have you
 got a small sonar tracker?

1041
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:53,156
- I think I can get one.

1042
01:09:53,156 --> 01:09:55,259
A friend of mine
 will loan it to me.

1043
01:09:55,259 --> 01:09:56,860
- I like it.

1044
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,795
All we do is wait out there
 until we detect the creature,

1045
01:09:58,795 --> 01:10:00,397
and then follow it in.

1046
01:10:00,397 --> 01:10:03,433
- And if the thing exists,
 that'll spot it alright?

1047
01:10:03,433 --> 01:10:04,668
- Yeah, but what then?

1048
01:10:04,668 --> 01:10:05,602
I mean, assuming
 that you spot it.

1049
01:10:05,602 --> 01:10:07,337
- We catch the bad ass mother.

1050
01:10:07,337 --> 01:10:09,439
I've got netting that'll
hold a great white.

1051
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:11,608
I guarantee it won't get away,

1052
01:10:11,608 --> 01:10:13,477
and I know a couple of
 guys that would love

1053
01:10:13,477 --> 01:10:14,744
to join to us on a monster hunt.

1054
01:10:14,744 --> 01:10:16,179
- Okay.
- Okay.

1055
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,615
Hell with the police.

1056
01:10:18,615 --> 01:10:20,517
Dr. John, you and Jeff

1057
01:10:20,517 --> 01:10:21,985
you wait by the canal entrance.

1058
01:10:21,985 --> 01:10:23,253
When we pick up the creature

1059
01:10:23,253 --> 01:10:24,354
and see he's headed
 towards the canals,

1060
01:10:24,354 --> 01:10:25,522
you close off the lock.

1061
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:27,791
- How are we gonna know?

1062
01:10:29,259 --> 01:10:31,661
- Yeah, there's a couple of
 radios I can get at school.

1063
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:32,862
I think I can get them
 out with no problem.

1064
01:10:32,862 --> 01:10:34,831
They're good for
 up to a mile or so.

1065
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:36,866
- And then when we
 close off the canal,

1066
01:10:36,866 --> 01:10:38,067
you guys follow the big boy

1067
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,336
wherever his appetite leads him.

1068
01:10:39,336 --> 01:10:41,271
- Right, send in the
 hue and cry as we go!

1069
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:43,407
- Oh, no, if this thing is real,

1070
01:10:43,407 --> 01:10:46,209
we ain't going to say anything
 to anyone until it's caught,

1071
01:10:46,209 --> 01:10:47,644
and I'm going to catch it.

1072
01:10:47,644 --> 01:10:49,012
- All right.

1073
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,532
- Sun's
 going down quick.

1074
01:11:08,532 --> 01:11:09,733
It should be a clear night.

1075
01:11:09,733 --> 01:11:11,000
- But in case it's not,

1076
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,102
I have Mike and Nicolas
to hook up the generator

1077
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,137
and the night lights.

1078
01:11:20,577 --> 01:11:22,546
The sonar is working okay,

1079
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:24,848
and I borrowed this
 spotlight in case we need it.

1080
01:11:24,848 --> 01:11:26,249
It's one powerful mother.

1081
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:28,585
- I hope this radio
 is gonna be all right.

1082
01:11:28,585 --> 01:11:30,086
It worked out fine at school.

1083
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,366
- And I brought this too.

1084
01:11:44,534 --> 01:11:46,603
- Yeah, I noticed.

1085
01:11:49,573 --> 01:11:51,074
I don't know if that's
 gonna be of any use though.

1086
01:11:51,074 --> 01:11:53,743
Remember the Dunns
unloaded a whole pistol

1087
01:11:53,743 --> 01:11:56,346
into that creature
 and nothing happened.

1088
01:11:56,346 --> 01:11:58,482
- This ain't a pistol, my man.

1089
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,955
Think we'll be here all night?

1090
01:12:05,955 --> 01:12:07,424
- I don't know.

1091
01:12:07,424 --> 01:12:09,092
Since it's never been
spotted during the day,

1092
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:11,260
I guess it does all
its forging after dark.

1093
01:12:12,462 --> 01:12:14,163
Maybe it's irritated
 by the boat traffic,

1094
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:15,665
and waits until it dies down.

1095
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:17,233
I don't know what
 senses this thing has,

1096
01:12:17,233 --> 01:12:20,470
so I don't know how it
 reacts to its environment.

1097
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:21,505
- It's got an appetite.

1098
01:12:21,505 --> 01:12:22,706
That's its downfall.

1099
01:12:24,207 --> 01:12:27,544
Give Mike and Nicolas a
 hand with the nets, will ya?

1100
01:12:27,544 --> 01:12:28,378
- Yeah, okay.

1101
01:12:59,409 --> 01:13:00,677
What time is it?

1102
01:13:01,511 --> 01:13:03,279
Oh, about 1:30.

1103
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:08,852
- Time isn't going
 by slow, it stopped.

1104
01:13:08,852 --> 01:13:09,853
- It feels that way.

1105
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:20,329
Wayne!

1106
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:21,164
- What?

1107
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,737
- It's real it's over there
 about 20 feet off the barge.

1108
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,172
Okay, okay.

1109
01:13:29,172 --> 01:13:31,608
Now when it really starts
moving, let it get enough head,

1110
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:32,809
so the engines don't spook it.

1111
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:34,644
- I just hope we
 can keep up with it.

1112
01:13:35,545 --> 01:13:36,613
This is it.

1113
01:13:36,613 --> 01:13:37,581
Wake up on deck.

1114
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:38,482
We got something.

1115
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:42,619
- Right back towards the marina.

1116
01:13:43,887 --> 01:13:45,589
Now don't lose it.

1117
01:13:45,589 --> 01:13:48,625
- Don't worry I couldn't lose
 junior here even if I tried.

1118
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:51,728
According to the sonar
 this thing is sized large.

1119
01:13:51,728 --> 01:13:53,329
- Straight for
 the canal entrance.

1120
01:13:53,329 --> 01:13:54,598
Hello, Jeff, hello, Jeff.

1121
01:13:56,533 --> 01:13:58,267
- Hi, honey, we're
 about to fall asleep.

1122
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,936
- Well, wake up
 because we're on our way.

1123
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:01,270
The creature is heading
right for the opening.

1124
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,039
Tell John to close off the lock.

1125
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:04,541
- What there really
 is something?

1126
01:14:04,541 --> 01:14:07,110
- We're following
 it now get John moving!

1127
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:08,778
- Dr. John, Dr. John wake up.

1128
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:09,713
- Huh, what is it?

1129
01:14:09,713 --> 01:14:10,947
- They're headed this way.

1130
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:11,881
They're tracking the
 thing towards us.

1131
01:14:11,881 --> 01:14:12,682
Wayne says to close the lock.

1132
01:14:12,682 --> 01:14:13,683
- Okay.

1133
01:14:37,006 --> 01:14:38,942
- Wayne,
 John's got it sealed.

1134
01:14:38,942 --> 01:14:40,744
- Good, now stay
 awake and keep your eyes open.

1135
01:14:40,744 --> 01:14:42,879
I don't know what
 you should expect.

1136
01:14:42,879 --> 01:14:44,814
- We see
 what we shall see.

1137
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:46,516
- Jeff,
 Chris says we're in

1138
01:14:46,516 --> 01:14:47,651
about as far as we can go.

1139
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:49,352
The creature's
 getting close to you,

1140
01:14:49,352 --> 01:14:50,253
but it's difficult
 to say just how close

1141
01:14:50,253 --> 01:14:52,255
because of the rocks.

1142
01:14:52,255 --> 01:14:53,089
- We're watching.

1143
01:14:54,858 --> 01:14:55,792
Wayne, I hear something.

1144
01:14:55,792 --> 01:14:57,126
- What's going on?

1145
01:14:57,126 --> 01:14:58,795
- Maybe I can see something.

1146
01:15:01,765 --> 01:15:03,232
- Okay, it must
 be heading for the boats.

1147
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:05,535
I should pick it up on
 the tracker pretty quick.

1148
01:15:34,397 --> 01:15:35,865
- Get the car quick!

1149
01:15:35,865 --> 01:15:37,100
Get in the car!

1150
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,674
- Wayne!

1151
01:15:48,244 --> 01:15:49,846
Wayne, it's coming!

1152
01:15:50,814 --> 01:15:51,748
Wayne!
 - the transmission's

1153
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:52,916
locked down inside the car!

1154
01:15:55,719 --> 01:15:56,686
- Wayne!

1155
01:15:56,686 --> 01:15:57,821
Wayne!

1156
01:16:15,438 --> 01:16:16,773
- Jeff!

1157
01:16:39,996 --> 01:16:41,765
- Get out of the car!

1158
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,960
- Dr. John!

1159
01:17:11,895 --> 01:17:12,729
Dr. John!

1160
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:16,065
Oh, Dr. John, are you alright?

1161
01:17:16,065 --> 01:17:17,066
- I'm okay.

1162
01:17:17,066 --> 01:17:17,901
I'm okay.

1163
01:17:23,072 --> 01:17:24,440
- Wayne, Wayne we're all right.

1164
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,475
Dr. John's not hurt.

1165
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,044
Wait the monster's
 not following him.

1166
01:17:28,044 --> 01:17:29,312
I think it's dead!

1167
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:31,580
- No, it's alive we got
it on the scanner again.

1168
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:32,816
It's headed for the harbor.

1169
01:17:32,816 --> 01:17:34,217
I think the thing was
 trying for the canal

1170
01:17:34,217 --> 01:17:35,051
when it ran into you.

1171
01:17:35,051 --> 01:17:36,419
- We gotta move.

1172
01:17:36,419 --> 01:17:38,354
Nicolas, keep your eyes open.

1173
01:17:38,354 --> 01:17:39,555
- Jeff, we're gonna follow it.

1174
01:17:39,555 --> 01:17:40,790
Head it off before
 he reaches the boats.

1175
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:42,558
Now you and John wait
for us at Chris's slip.

1176
01:17:42,558 --> 01:17:45,628
- Wayne, be
 careful, I love you.

1177
01:17:45,628 --> 01:17:47,663
- The things making
 a crazy move,

1178
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,265
but it doesn't
 seem to be injured.

1179
01:17:49,265 --> 01:17:51,234
- The son of a bitch
 probably can't feel pain.

1180
01:17:51,234 --> 01:17:52,535
You know if it gets
 in the docking area

1181
01:17:52,535 --> 01:17:53,669
under the boats we've lost it.

1182
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:55,104
- I've got that covered.

1183
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:57,073
We're gonna get it to
 chase after us for a while.

1184
01:17:57,073 --> 01:17:58,607
- How?

1185
01:17:58,607 --> 01:18:00,744
- I've got 30 gallons
 of chum in the tank.

1186
01:18:00,744 --> 01:18:01,945
If the big boy is hungry,

1187
01:18:01,945 --> 01:18:03,713
I'll give him all he can handle.

1188
01:18:03,713 --> 01:18:06,149
Remember, brother, this
thing is just a fish.

1189
01:18:06,149 --> 01:18:07,616
I'm one hell of a fisherman.

1190
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:08,852
Take over the helm.

1191
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:26,269
Here, pour this fragrant
garbage over the port

1192
01:18:26,269 --> 01:18:27,771
while I reverse our direction.

1193
01:18:32,742 --> 01:18:34,643
Dinner is served
you big bastard.

1194
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:35,644
Fish head soup.

1195
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:48,257
Okay, you ready to put the
 hook to the slimy beast.

1196
01:18:49,993 --> 01:18:52,395
- I guess, what's the plan?

1197
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:54,097
- We're gonna net it,
 drag it off to sea,

1198
01:18:54,097 --> 01:18:55,731
wear it down and pull it in.

1199
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:58,301
- Pull it in, we just saw that
 son of a bitch demolish a car

1200
01:18:58,301 --> 01:18:59,535
and you're gonna pull it in?

1201
01:18:59,535 --> 01:19:00,804
How about calling
 the Coast Guard?

1202
01:19:00,804 --> 01:19:03,272
- No way, this
 thing belongs to us.

1203
01:19:03,272 --> 01:19:06,309
Besides if this creature is
 shy of boats like you say,

1204
01:19:06,309 --> 01:19:08,411
an open call to the Coast
 Guard is gonna bring out

1205
01:19:08,411 --> 01:19:09,946
every boat in the harbor.

1206
01:19:09,946 --> 01:19:12,048
The thing will then
 head right out to sea.

1207
01:19:13,016 --> 01:19:14,417
- You sure about the nets?

1208
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:16,652
- Hey, man, strongest still.

1209
01:19:20,023 --> 01:19:21,190
- Let's do it.

1210
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,959
- Okay, I'll slow her down.

1211
01:19:25,394 --> 01:19:26,229
Nicolas.

1212
01:19:28,197 --> 01:19:29,598
Move forward and keep watch.

1213
01:19:31,467 --> 01:19:32,969
Now dump what you've got left.

1214
01:19:34,237 --> 01:19:35,704
Right next to the side.

1215
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:38,107
When we spot it below
 surface, we toss the net.

1216
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:41,544
Oh, shit.

1217
01:19:43,246 --> 01:19:44,747
- What happened?

1218
01:19:44,747 --> 01:19:46,349
- I don't know, but I don't
 wanna be sitting without power

1219
01:19:46,349 --> 01:19:47,917
when that thing
 finishes the chum.

1220
01:19:47,917 --> 01:19:49,385
Mike, take the helm.

1221
01:19:52,555 --> 01:19:53,389
Let's go below.

1222
01:20:07,503 --> 01:20:08,604
Dammit.

1223
01:20:08,604 --> 01:20:09,839
Engine's overheated.

1224
01:20:09,839 --> 01:20:11,207
Bring me a bucket of water.

1225
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:32,661
I can't wet it now.

1226
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:34,663
If I crack the block, that's it.

1227
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:35,999
- What caused it to overheat?

1228
01:20:35,999 --> 01:20:37,833
- I don't know maybe
 the water pump.

1229
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:40,469
I can fix it but not
 until it cools down.

1230
01:20:40,469 --> 01:20:42,538
Close the door the guys
 on deck don't have to know

1231
01:20:42,538 --> 01:20:43,606
what's happening here.

1232
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:48,077
- I don't see a
 damn thing out here.

1233
01:20:48,077 --> 01:20:50,446
Mike, turn on the
 big lamp, will you?

1234
01:20:53,149 --> 01:20:54,650
- Oh, hell, this
 thing isn't working.

1235
01:20:54,650 --> 01:20:56,585
I'm gonna have to
 find a flashlight.

1236
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:06,562
- Take your time.

1237
01:21:07,897 --> 01:21:09,398
Not much happening out here.

1238
01:21:16,505 --> 01:21:17,406
- Oh, Mike!

1239
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,242
- Look out!

1240
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,043
Use the shotgun.

1241
01:22:08,324 --> 01:22:11,995
Wayne, the net we can snare him.

1242
01:22:24,707 --> 01:22:25,608
Whoa!

1243
01:22:28,011 --> 01:22:29,112
Wayne!

1244
01:22:43,926 --> 01:22:45,028
Wayne!

1245
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:53,088
- He's dead now.

1246
01:24:54,623 --> 01:24:56,091
- Then let's get
rid of the nasty

1247
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,127
son of a bitch over the side.

1248
01:24:59,828 --> 01:25:00,629
- No!

1249
01:25:01,464 --> 01:25:03,199
We gotta take it back.

1250
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:04,633
Proof.

1251
01:25:04,633 --> 01:25:05,468
- Of what?

1252
01:25:07,069 --> 01:25:09,104
Mike, Nicolas gone.

1253
01:25:10,206 --> 01:25:12,007
The two of us damn near dead.

1254
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:16,078
That's garbage there.

1255
01:25:16,912 --> 01:25:18,247
Wayne smell it, man.

1256
01:25:19,415 --> 01:25:21,784
It came from the
 sea now it's dead.

1257
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:22,751
Send it back!

1258
01:25:44,307 --> 01:25:45,140
It's better, man.

1259
01:25:46,542 --> 01:25:50,012
That thing doesn't belong
 with us, with anyone.

1260
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:58,020
- Yeah, okay.

1261
01:26:01,957 --> 01:26:03,659
Yeah, what the hell.
