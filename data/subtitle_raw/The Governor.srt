1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,399
Wait a minute, where to?

2
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,552
What cleaning at this time?

3
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,235
But this is not you!

4
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,397
You think you are a man now?

5
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,828
Shame on you Faruk,
where have you been?

6
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,708
I was worried. You didn't
answer your phone either?

7
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,436
I was strip club hopping Melek.

8
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,073
Faruk?

9
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,675
- Well then, Mr. Ömer, see you later.
- Of course.

10
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,513
- Master, what the heck does he want again?
- What could he, me.

11
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,476
I don't get his insistency...

12
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,630
Come on Levent, get in the car,
we're late.

13
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,393
I am here master...

14
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,400
No sir, he didn't accept it again.

15
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,995
I got it sir, will talk to you later.

16
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,233
To the airport.

17
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,925
Gentlemen! Every city has its needs.
Its deficiencies, mistakes...

18
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,565
...its questioning, stuffy, left alone
people. That's when you get into...

19
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,512
...the picture and say, I am here... you
roll up up your sleeves and startfighting...

20
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,352
...so that those people
can live a better life.

21
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,115
You start sweating so that city can
be in peace with its government...

22
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,311
That's when the nation's love
and devotion follow you.

23
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,032
Manager, those night clubs are like a
knife stabbed into the heart of this city.

24
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,645
Dear governor, you are so right.

25
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,645
But owners of the management
had prepared...

26
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,605
...all necessary papers and
done their application.

27
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,240
They also cut the music at midnight
we are in desperate straits...

28
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:39,360
So there is nothing to be done legally...

29
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:40,685
What do you mean there is nothing?

30
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,280
People who live at that street
have no life security.

31
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,200
How can a hospital, mosque, school and
a night club coexist in the same place?

32
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:48,952
How did those men
get their permit president?

33
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,358
Sir, couple of managements had applied
before we came in charge.

34
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,190
And?

35
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,000
They got their permit by taking
advantage of legal gaps in the system.

36
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:57,716
And?

37
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,480
After we were elected, other managements
pointed at those couple as an example...

38
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:04,278
...therefore we had to give them
their new permits as well.

39
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,205
I got it, got it.

40
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,160
Now you will take the chief of police
force with you and go to that street.

41
00:05:10,195 --> 00:05:12,879
Then you will close down all those
managements one by one...

42
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,280
Dear governor, how could it be?
We don't have any legal support.

43
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,436
It can and it will.
I am the legal support.

44
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:20,558
If they ask,
tell them it's the governor.

45
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,955
I mean which one is more important?

46
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,360
Our citizens safety or keeping
those night clubs open?

47
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:27,200
Certainly our citizens dear governer.

48
00:05:27,235 --> 00:05:28,235
Well done president.

49
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Dear governor, we will immediately
enforce your instructions sir.

50
00:05:31,595 --> 00:05:34,600
Yes chief ASAP. Those night clubs
will shut down today.

51
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:35,396
Then I, actually we...

52
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,400
...will take our wives and walk up and
down at that street all together.

53
00:05:40,435 --> 00:05:43,360
Then people will see, that
street is safe and it's ours.

54
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:45,191
That street belongs to Denizli people.

55
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,112
End of the meeting, come on.

56
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,565
Come on, chief.

57
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,999
Prove me good president, come on.

58
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,365
Based on an announcement, Tarik Sarac,
the management president of...

59
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,440
...Sarac Holding company lost his life
after an armed attack yesterday afternoon.

60
00:06:05,475 --> 00:06:07,925
He will be buried today at 2p. m.

61
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,111
Based on police headquarters explanation
an illegal left organization...

62
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,818
...took the responsibility of the attack.
The police announced that...

63
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:18,437
...they will be doing a large scaled
national operation on the issue.

64
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,960
- My love did you come?
- Nop, I didn't.

65
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,920
- How are you?
- Good, you?

66
00:06:38,955 --> 00:06:39,875
Good.

67
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,485
Are we leaving right now?

68
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,832
Yes. Let's go and eat some food
immediately, I am hungry like a wolf.

69
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,805
You're logged in for your e-mail,
I am logging you out.

70
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,070
Yeah I was checking it while
waiting for you. You can close it.

71
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,349
OK.

72
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,037
- Let's go.
- Come on.

73
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,756
Denizli Karahayit M.T.A. Research center

74
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,996
Samples from 20th meter are done too.
I think we definitely found it master.

75
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,829
Based on the reports, we did. I hope all
our efforts won't be for nothing.

76
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,875
I hope so.

77
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,551
Will you be able to hit the road
tomorrow? Did you call Ankara?

78
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,519
Yes I will master... I talked with
Mr. Ahmet, they are waiting for me.

79
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,876
Good, may it go well... Ok I am leaving.
Will see you in the morning.

80
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,393
- See you later master.
- May your work go well.

81
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,951
USA and Turkey are two friend countries
that act together on many issues...

82
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,725
...such as middle-east politics.

83
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,240
Turkey that can become self-dependent
and powerful with its energy sources...

84
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:08,800
...and economy is also
for the advantage...

85
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:12,429
...of our strategic partner; USA.

86
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,840
Our country, just like the others...

87
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,925
...will meet the necessary inspection...

88
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,034
...requirements and will create
alternative energy sources.

89
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,805
Nuclear energy is our
priorority in these days...

90
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,479
...when many resources and
oil are about to be exhausted.

91
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,857
Our main purpose here
is to make national...

92
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:31,874
...services continue in most easiest and...

93
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,918
...cheapest ways without
interrupting the...

94
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:37,876
...production and consumption
of our country.

95
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,125
Considering our current
technologic deficiencies...

96
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:48,080
...best way to reach our underground
wealth is by benefitting from...

97
00:08:48,115 --> 00:08:51,436
...our friend countries' technologies
based on our interest.

98
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,480
Multi-national and long term investment
partnerships on mines such as oil...

99
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:59,109
...gold and boron has
benefited our country.

100
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,989
Follow it.

101
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,833
Ömer. Are you sure?
This is very serious.

102
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,639
I know Faruk.

103
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,160
Sarp got the first tests
done in the university.

104
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:30,798
Result is positive.

105
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,240
If the sample's uranium values turn
out to be expected on top of this...

106
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:36,800
There will be a chaos.

107
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,875
Right, I hope they won't walk on us.

108
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,190
They will dear, they will.

109
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,840
There are guys who wait on alertjust to
make sure nothing good happens to...

110
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,798
...this country. Those will
come after us as well.

111
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,470
Stop by my house tonight.
We'll see what we can do.

112
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,997
Melek has been asking about you anyways.

113
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,389
- This will be an excuse for her to
finally see you. - See you tonight.

114
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,109
Ömer...

115
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,840
Let's take a walk together
before you enter my house tonight.

116
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,800
At that night time?
What kind of walk?

117
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:09,960
Walk bro, usual walk you know.

118
00:10:09,995 --> 00:10:10,925
Ok, calm down.

119
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,325
Tonight, first the walk
then dinner.

120
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,032
- First walk then dinner.
- All right cool.

121
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,948
He's asking the kind of walk! What kind of
walk can it be... Walk is walk.

122
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,709
Open it.

123
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,309
What's it?

124
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,353
I'm drinking sugar-free.
Let's see.

125
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,245
Dear governor, welcome.

126
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,920
- Simit seller, how have you been?
- Thank you sir, how about yourself?

127
00:11:32,955 --> 00:11:34,672
- Not bad.
- Welcome Mr. Governor.

128
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,354
Welcome Mr. Governor.

129
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,880
- How is your business going?
- Thanks Mr. Governor.

130
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:42,996
- Sir welcome.
- Hello.

131
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,149
Dear governer, eat some
sunflower seeds before you leave.

132
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,525
Yilmaz.

133
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,199
The street has been great,
it's been so peaceful.

134
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,679
- Here you go. - Thank you.
- Ömer.

135
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,480
Do you have a plastic bag,
we should't throw the peel.

136
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,085
Go ahead sir throw it.

137
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,480
Since our streets has gotten rid of those
bastards. Go ahead and throw it.

138
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:02,720
I will clean it up till the morning.
Throw it.

139
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,600
All right. Ok.

140
00:12:04,635 --> 00:12:06,636
Hello.

141
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,073
- Thank you.
- You still have more to go?

142
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,833
Yes a lot more.
My head can't get it no more.

143
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,110
Then let's sleep I will wake you up
early in the morning and you can work.

144
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,233
Let me finish it, I want it to end. If I go
to bed now, I won't be able to sleep well.

145
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,870
Ok.

146
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:52,752
Then I should remind you how much
you'll be missing and I am gone.

147
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,953
- You'll see when this project ends.
- Yeah right.

148
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,474
- Good night.
- Ok good luck.

149
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,631
Cheers to my old friends and to Istanbul,
where I missed a lot.

150
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,032
Yes, let's talk about our subject.

151
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,440
Ceyda, alternative energy sources and
especially nuclear energy are very...

152
00:13:22,475 --> 00:13:25,876
...important nowadays, just like
you said during the panel today.

153
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,360
Ok, we may have enough oil for 40 years
for us in Iraq and in whole middle-east.

154
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:35,478
But we need to consider
the future afterwards.

155
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,559
Future coming years' oil is uranium.

156
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,440
And we are seeking to be the suitors
of that with the support of you, our...

157
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:49,878
...precious friends. We did some
research. We discovered rich...

158
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,714
...uranium beds in foremost Denizli
and many other cities.

159
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,559
Mr. Kamil is the general manager of
American Stones which has been operating...

160
00:13:59,594 --> 00:14:04,719
...for 4 years in Denizli. He'd like to
add a new marble quarry to his factory.

161
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,836
And he finished all legal application
process. Now Ceyda, my request...

162
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,550
...from you is that you help Mr. Kamil
on land designation he wants.

163
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,472
I will do my best sir.

164
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,640
Considering how Turkish government
loves foreigner investors...

165
00:14:21,675 --> 00:14:24,871
...I don't think it will be hard at all.
Right Mr. Ender?

166
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,718
No doubt.

167
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,229
Foreign investment is the product
with the brightest pack.

168
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,273
Opposed force was
convicted 28 years ago.

169
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,876
Good.

170
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,999
Are all this preparation just because
Uranium was found in Denizli?

171
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,605
What good does it do unless
you can process it?

172
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,840
Unfortunately, our country doesn't have
neither the science nor the technology to...

173
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:53,277
...process that metal.
- None. India has it, Iran has it.

174
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,470
I mean if they don't keep bothering
we could have it as well.

175
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,920
- Faruk, Chernobyl.
- Don't start Melek.

176
00:15:01,955 --> 00:15:04,309
Hiroshima, Nagasaki.

177
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,600
What's important is that energy needs
to be used for the development...

178
00:15:08,635 --> 00:15:11,910
...and relief of the country not
for armament purposes.

179
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,638
Japan is particulary the country where
nuclear energy is being used the most.

180
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,080
Whether or not having uranium
is not as important as...

181
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,991
...being able to claim the value of it.

182
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,594
That area's MTA manager is Ömer Ucar.

183
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,309
And he has been working on the land
that we want to have for a long time.

184
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,469
I offered Ömer Ucar a job position
with great conditions many times.

185
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,458
But I wasn't able to convince him.

186
00:15:37,493 --> 00:15:39,876
What can be done about this you think?

187
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,635
Do you have any idea on what kind
of project he is working on Mr. Kamil?

188
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,760
No, but he mentioned it as a project
he has been working on...

189
00:15:47,795 --> 00:15:50,205
...for many years during
our last meeting.

190
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,199
Ceyda, do you think this guys
knows what we know?

191
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,645
I don't think so.

192
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,240
If that was the case, he would have
needed to get a permit for the samples...

193
00:15:57,275 --> 00:16:00,471
...from MTA Ankara, and I'd have been
informed about that.

194
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,670
Let's say he found Uranium.

195
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,837
If he sends it to Ankara,
what can we do?

196
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,074
A council starts an inspection after
samples are received in MTA.

197
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,834
There is nothing I can do
about that step sir.

198
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,869
Understood.

199
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,320
Then, samples shouldn't
reach Ankara no matter what.

200
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:27,600
Are you taking the samples to Ankara?

201
00:16:27,635 --> 00:16:28,794
Levent is taking them.

202
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,276
If the results are positive, then we'll
go to ministry together.

203
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,912
Hope so Faruk.

204
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,920
- We will need huge support
from the government. - Definitely.

205
00:16:39,955 --> 00:16:41,194
Definitely.

206
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,752
That's if they want to of course.

207
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,269
Not that far dear... No one can dare
to look into the eye of the nation...

208
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,754
...and lie them about a subject that
would benefit our country.

209
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,630
What if that nation is
looking somewhere else?

210
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,276
What is they are being brainwashed
with fake agendas and crises?

211
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,508
Then it is ourjob to wake those
people up, ourjob my mate.

212
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,317
- Ömer.
- Thanks dear.

213
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,715
How is Sarp? He never calls.

214
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,918
To be honest I don't know either.

215
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,588
- He is love drunk nowadays.
- What love?

216
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,085
- Call that donkey for me.
- Don't call him at this time.

217
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,635
- It's so inappropriate dear.
- Of course we call at this time, when else can we call?

218
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,750
It's ringing.

219
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:28,796
Hello.

220
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,437
Why are you whispering?
I guess your little lady is sleeping huh?

221
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,318
Yes she is bro, what's up?

222
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,430
I can't hear what you're saying,
talk louder.

223
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,480
I said she is sleeping, sleeping.
What do you want from me at this time?

224
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:45,313
Look at him. He is obstinating
his brother. Give it to me.

225
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,836
Hello.

226
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,034
- Faruk bro!
- Damn right Faruk bro.

227
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,125
What's up with you not
calling not asking us?

228
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,549
On top of it, were you just obstinating
my 40 year old friend?

229
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,840
- Not at all bro, would I ever do that.
- Of course you wouldn't, couldn't anyways.

230
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,798
- Enough. Don't make a fuss over the kid.
Give me that phone. - Melek stop.

231
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,195
- Sarp How are you?
- I am fine Melek sis. Fine.

232
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,830
I'm doing the only thing I've been doing
in last 5 years working. How are you?

233
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,470
I am fine too.
So, how is it going with Ayþe?

234
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,040
- Tell him to take Ayþe too and come here.
- Did you hear what Faruk just said?

235
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:19,837
I did, I did Melek sis.

236
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,518
School has been
very hectic.

237
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,073
Ayþe is working on her
master thesis.

238
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,000
It's really hard for us
to come there at this point.

239
00:18:26,035 --> 00:18:28,833
Well manage an appropriate
time and come.

240
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,430
I hope so Melek sis,
I miss you you all.

241
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,760
Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield,
William Mckinley, John F. Kennedy.

242
00:18:38,795 --> 00:18:42,116
Ender what do those name mean to you?

243
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,393
In the history of USA, there was an
assasination to every one president out of ten.

244
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,999
Yes I am not proud of this but,
things have to keep working somehow.

245
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,793
The foremost requirement to be big is to
get what you want, whenever you want.

246
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,578
Now are you telling that a
small administrator from...

247
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:06,157
...a small city of a small country
will be an obstacle?

248
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,445
Sir I actually meant.

249
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,316
Bull. I don't think that governor will
have the courage to stand in front of us.

250
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,194
And if he does, whatever is necessary
will be done without a doubt.

251
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,560
Dear governor. Don't you think shutting
down the club managements...

252
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:27,028
...at Istiklal st. Is a bit of
an arbitrary operation?

253
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,879
Arbitrary?

254
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,358
Arbitrary?

255
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,879
Now listen my friends...

256
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,019
Government should first of all
destroy the elements...

257
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,759
...that are threatening for
the safety of our citizens.

258
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,071
This is the purpose of a
government's existence.

259
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,685
It is the fundamental duty.

260
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,874
That duty involves its police,
its soldiers, its justice and laws.

261
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,719
This has nothing to do with being a socialist
government or democracy for that manner.

262
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,998
Citizens should be able
to trust its government.

263
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,548
We provided that trust,
what's so bad about that?

264
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,118
Sir, how about the alcohol ban and
Murat the 4th comparison?

265
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,279
My friends...

266
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,920
We are not opposed to no one's drinking, we
don't have the right to say don't drink either.

267
00:20:12,955 --> 00:20:15,229
We didn't ask
why do you sell alcohol either.

268
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,510
But, freedom...

269
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,592
...doesn't mean that anyone can behave
however they want.

270
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,593
Personal freedom ends, when it stops
someone else's freedom.

271
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,354
Sir have you been threatening by
the management owners?

272
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,200
Threat? Did we receive any Veysel?

273
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:32,405
No sir.

274
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,793
Now my friends...

275
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,640
The first condition to have trust and
peace in this country is if honorable...

276
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:41,805
...people are as brave as
the dishonorable ones.

277
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,765
And if couple of swag men ever
dare to threaten a governor...

278
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,555
...then it is my obligation as
the governor to stand in front of them.

279
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,685
Yes?

280
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,994
Yilmaz is calling.

281
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,269
Connect him.

282
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,079
How are you Ms. Ceyda?

283
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,318
Thank you sir how about yourself?

284
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,749
Thanks Ms. Ceyda.

285
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,232
I am sorry, apparantly you had called
but I couldn't answer the phone.

286
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,238
They called from Denizli MTA. I had to
prepare the lab immediately.

287
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,869
How come?

288
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,670
Is it uranium?

289
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,359
Ok Mr. Ahmet. Please keep
me updated. Later.

290
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,115
I see... Ok.

291
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,080
What happened to that land in Heybeli Island?
Did you receive the construction permit?

292
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,310
No problem there sir.
Thanks to you.

293
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,908
Don't even mention it.

294
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,760
A foreign investment at this scale is
a big chance not only for Denizli...

295
00:22:19,795 --> 00:22:21,671
...but for our country as well.

296
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,912
Unfortunately, there are still minds who
approach foreign stocks with suspicion.

297
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,798
I am sure your positive writings on that
matter would be very beneficial.

298
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,435
- Don't even doubt I, of course sir.
- Thank you.

299
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,594
Sir there has been talks on how you will
get back into politics in the lobby.

300
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,240
It would be a lie if I say I didn't think
about it, but of course it would be with...

301
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:48,677
...a new party that fits our mission. We
are continuing to work on that subject.

302
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,279
When the right time comes we will
certainly need your help.

303
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,439
This is done too.

304
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,834
Master, see you later.

305
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,510
Later.

306
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,520
I will call you
when I get to Ankara.

307
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:48,476
- Have a nice trip.
- Good bye.

308
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,110
Stop.

309
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,756
Stop.

310
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,030
Stop.

311
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,789
Yes.

312
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,911
M.T.A vehicle?

313
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,194
Levent.

314
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,035
Let me go.

315
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,632
It's not Levent right?

316
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,113
That's not Levent,
it's not him... Let me go...

317
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,674
Levent.

318
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,237
Ok calm down.
Its passed now.

319
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,433
Guys take Mr. Ömer to the headquarters.
Ok, calm down...

320
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,199
Levent.

321
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,800
Why in the hell you didn't
cover the body?

322
00:26:31,835 --> 00:26:33,233
Quick, come on quick.

323
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,915
How did it happen?

324
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,240
Chief, he couldn't take the
curve and rolled down.

325
00:26:39,275 --> 00:26:40,958
Ok, I am going to the head office.

326
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,874
- Crime scene?
- They will be here in a minute.

327
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,759
Ömer!

328
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,670
May your life be spared.
Come on sit down.

329
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,072
I am so sorry Mr. Ömer.

330
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:01,077
I can't believe this,
we were just together today.

331
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,351
That's how it is Ömer...
That's how this fucking world is.

332
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,193
How did it happen Tahir?

333
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,074
Sir, he couldn't take the curve
and rolled over the cliff.

334
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,318
We loaded the samples to the vehicle
together around 1 p. m.

335
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,031
And he hit the road.

336
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,605
I received the news
half an hour later.

337
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,160
There were many boxes on the ground of the
scene, they were spilled all over the place.

338
00:29:03,195 --> 00:29:05,116
Are those what
you mentioned as samples?

339
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,394
Yes...

340
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,797
He was taking them
to Ankara for an inspection.

341
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,149
What inspection?

342
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,918
We had been doing some work in
that area on Uranium for 3 months.

343
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,559
Uranium?

344
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,708
I am flying to Denizli early
in the morning sir.

345
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,565
Howcome?

346
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,565
I will ask a permission from dear
governor for an investment...

347
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,752
...that will be made by an international company to Denizli.
- From Faruk?

348
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,880
Yes, I don't think there will
be any problems but...

349
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,999
No worries, I will call
Faruk myself if needed.

350
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,599
No doubt.

351
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,233
Uður, send the crime scene team
towards the upper curve.

352
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,045
Tell them to investigate tire marks
on the ground very well.

353
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,914
Also, I want to know which car do
these broken glass piece belong to.

354
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,559
Sarp?

355
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,918
I am fine, fine. Don't worry.

356
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,990
We need to get used to these stuff.

357
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,199
I'll prepare my baggage.

358
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,231
I am coming to Denizli too.

359
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,399
You are coming too?

360
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,125
I don't think this is
a right time Ayþe.

361
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,913
I'm not interested whether
or not the time is right.

362
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,151
I just think that I should be with you
during these times that's it.

363
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,838
Why are you looking at me like that?

364
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,551
I love you so much.

365
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,516
I love you so much too.

366
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,285
Chief?

367
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,719
Come in Ugur.

368
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,430
Chief, glass pieces from the scene
belongs to rear stop lights of the jeep...

369
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,115
...engineer Levent was driving. Also, tire
marks belongs to his vehicle as well.

370
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,240
There were some other tire marks close.

371
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,835
To the cliff's edge
that blong to another vehicle.

372
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,560
Those marks ends right
by the edge of the cliff.

373
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,685
- So you are saying that there is
another vehicle in this. - Yes chief.

374
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,400
Talk with the traffic and learn if there
was any accident reports in that area.

375
00:34:46,435 --> 00:34:47,594
Got it.

376
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,634
Send a team to the industry
for an investigation.

377
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,840
Update all the patrols on this.

378
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:54,034
Yes sir.

379
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,353
Brother.

380
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:01,517
I couldn't take care of Levent.
I couldn't protect him.

381
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,599
Brother...

382
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,038
Sir I postponed all your meetings...

383
00:36:19,073 --> 00:36:21,196
...before the funeral to afternoon.

384
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,405
Ms. Ceyda?

385
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,317
I explained the situation to
her dear governor.

386
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,153
She said that she will be
joining the funeral herself.

387
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,085
Good.

388
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,556
One more thing, Chief Tahir is
waiting for you in your room.

389
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,520
- Tahir?
- Yes sir.

390
00:36:33,555 --> 00:36:34,509
Really?

391
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,633
Good morning Tahir.

392
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,995
Tahir.

393
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,760
Dear governor, forgive me.

394
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,273
It's ok sit, sit.

395
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,634
Dear governor I am so sorry.

396
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,392
Sit down bro it's ok.

397
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,880
I was looking for a car till
the morning, so I fell asleep like that.

398
00:37:03,915 --> 00:37:05,029
What's going on?

399
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,589
I bothered you to present
just that dear governor.

400
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,200
We found another vehicle's tire
marks on the ground where engineer...

401
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:12,811
...Levent had the accident.

402
00:37:12,846 --> 00:37:14,388
What does that mean Tahir?

403
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,914
It means this sir.

404
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,749
There is either someone who caused
the accident or at least witnessed it.

405
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,070
We lost a young man who served
his country with honor.

406
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,395
He sweated himself so that our society
could be more improved and peaceful.

407
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,116
He tried to discover new treasures
for us deep underground.

408
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,513
He spent a lifetime in soil.

409
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:56,680
He loved the soil, very much.

410
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,398
Who knew it is time to give him to soil
that he loves very much forever.

411
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,272
I am sorry.

412
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,518
Welcome Ms. Ceyda, Mr. Governer
is waiting for you, this way.

413
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,353
Dear governor?

414
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,508
Ms. Ceyda, please come in.

415
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,920
- Welcome.
- Thank you sir.

416
00:38:53,955 --> 00:38:55,751
This way please.

417
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,714
Unfortunately, we happen to meet
on a sorrowful day.

418
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,634
Unfortunately Ms. Ceyda. We lost
a very precious young man.

419
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,677
Right sir. It is very hard to digest.

420
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,796
Yes, hard, very hard situation.

421
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,713
I should have gone.

422
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,429
What does that have do with anything
bro? Please don't do this for god's sake.

423
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,712
Let's leave this place, I feel like
the walls are coming over me.

424
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,199
Dear...

425
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,395
Sir, this company will make a 2 billion
dollars worth investment for the first 5 years.

426
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,837
They also signed prudential, long term deals
with many other, multi-nation companies.

427
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,645
Nice, nice.

428
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,114
And the company is a claimant
for bigger marble reserves.

429
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,430
I see.

430
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,556
Necessary permits are taken
from the ministry.

431
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,995
You can see them in
the folder in front of you.

432
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,910
As we know, your signature is needed
in order to complete the file.

433
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,152
But Ms. Ceyda, I can't see
the name of the region here.

434
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,793
Excuse me sir.

435
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,719
Karahayit sir.

436
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,035
Karahayit?

437
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,396
MTA is currently working in that region.

438
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,435
I know sir.

439
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,960
If you know that, you must as well
know that the young man we buried...

440
00:40:45,995 --> 00:40:48,030
...today was working for that region.

441
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,318
You are right sir, but as you know
our ministry has some agreements...

442
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,685
...with foreign investors.

443
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,280
Don't make me start with your ministry and
the foreign investors and their agreements.

444
00:40:56,315 --> 00:40:57,508
I don't give
a damn about your ministry.

445
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,479
I don't care.
What a nerve, what boldness!

446
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,485
You misundertand sir.

447
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,432
No I didn't.
There is no misunderstanding.

448
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,391
I just don't want to hear anything
related to this right now.

449
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,549
Dear governor, you are acting arbitrary.

450
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,795
Arbitrary? I don't think so Ms. Ceyda.

451
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,231
Because I am not in the mood,
no mood no signature.

452
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,996
Now please excuse me.

453
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,513
Excuse me.

454
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,394
That's not good.

455
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,076
That guy won't give a yes easily.

456
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,791
It is in your hands to make him.

457
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,036
It's not that simple. This governor is
not like other guys you know.

458
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,633
All right then.

459
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,597
I will inform Mr. Peterson.

460
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,070
Faruk what is this topic with
Ms. Ceyda all about?

461
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,436
Ms. Ceyda asked Karahayit from me.

462
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,318
A factory is a suitor for a marble
business. The ministry stands behind them.

463
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,630
And?

464
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,110
- And what?
- You're giving away the land?

465
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,116
Listen for a minute, stop and listen.
I'm not giving no one anything.

466
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,994
You can't give away that land to anyone.
That's Leven't land.

467
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,819
Did I say any different?

468
00:42:49,854 --> 00:42:51,479
Listen for a second listen.

469
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,958
Ms. Ceyda came with a file
signed by the ministry...

470
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,760
...it only lacks my signature...
You need to hurry up and...

471
00:43:01,795 --> 00:43:04,718
...get that report from
MTA as soon as possible.

472
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,233
How soon is that?

473
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,915
I will try to put it off
as much as I can.

474
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,668
But I don't think we have much time.

475
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,634
Those guys came with
a billion-dollar investment huh.

476
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,315
Faruk, what you're saying is hard.

477
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,000
It might take months for another
engineer to replace Levent.

478
00:43:21,035 --> 00:43:22,877
How can I find one
in such short notice?

479
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,269
Here.

480
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,794
- No way.
- Of course not.

481
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,830
- If one of you could give me a reason why not.
- Are you going to quit from school?

482
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,598
No bro, but I was considering
the permission option.

483
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,114
Don't be arrogant.

484
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,959
Ömer, wait let the kid explain.

485
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,513
Bro, wells are ready, there
is no other digging work.

486
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,757
If I am in, we can finish
this job in a week.

487
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,834
Fine. We might
consider it. Maybe.

488
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,558
I can enter the wells too.

489
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,155
Sure. What are you planning
to do in the well dear?

490
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,670
Are you going to teach samples
how to speak English?

491
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,400
Look Melek, see? Solidarity is in
this country's people's fabric.

492
00:44:11,435 --> 00:44:13,725
That's the spirit of a strong army.

493
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,069
What would happen to
your situation with the school?

494
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,360
Not important Ömer bro, since
I am writing my thesis nowadays...

495
00:44:18,395 --> 00:44:21,245
...profesors don't mind
it If I don't go to school.

496
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,239
And like Faruk bro said, it is important
to stick together during these days.

497
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,479
Well down dear, very good.

498
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,725
Are you in English literature major?

499
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,115
No Melek sis, American
language and literature.

500
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,314
Really, that's needed too of course.

501
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,037
- Ok Ayþe then ok.
- Perfect.

502
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,276
Since I got the job, if you excuse
me I need to call my family.

503
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,885
How did you get this girl yo?

504
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,119
You're right Ömer. You caught a mouse
since you've been a cat once.

505
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,996
Ok, got it.

506
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,394
Who the hell does this guy thinks he is?
We don't have much time left.

507
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,360
We need to finish the job
from a higher power position.

508
00:45:21,395 --> 00:45:23,920
Don't worry, Ceyda is taking care of it.

509
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,515
How?

510
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,877
Ceyda is finishing the job from up.

511
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,231
- You couldn't persuade him huh?
- Unfortunately.

512
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,509
I am not surprised at all. Faruk is
a hard man. So what should we do then?

513
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,757
I need help, maybe if you talk with him.

514
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:57,913
If I talk with him huh?
Sure why not.

515
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,118
Phone.

516
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,552
But sir... It's yet...

517
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,717
I got it. Don't worry.

518
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,993
See you later.

519
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,520
Sir, our delegate is on the line.

520
00:46:41,555 --> 00:46:42,794
Connect it.

521
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,557
How are you dear delegate?
Thanks I am fine.

522
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,914
I was going to ask
your favor on a matter.

523
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,338
3 days later.

524
00:46:59,373 --> 00:47:01,677
What the hell.

525
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,558
Connect it.

526
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,429
How are you?
I am fine thank you.

527
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,713
Sure ok yeah... I see sir, I see.

528
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,593
I will take care of it eventually.

529
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,034
Have a good day to you too sir.

530
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:48,638
What is it again, what is it?
Who? Send her in.

531
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,709
Our lady has come for
a second round Veysel.

532
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,630
Let her come sir, if she comes,
the consequences will come as well.

533
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,908
- Dear governor.
- Ms. Ceyda.

534
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,878
- Wouldn't you like to sit?
- No sir it's better like this.

535
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,755
However you like, go ahead.

536
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,240
I'm bothering you with
the same subject sir.

537
00:48:19,275 --> 00:48:21,595
When am I getting the
necessary papers?

538
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,991
You are not getting any Ms. Ceyda.

539
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,469
Excuse me?

540
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:33,895
You're not getting it, because the
region that was mentioned has been...

541
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:40,070
...declared as a afforestation
field, by the command of the governor.

542
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,798
What? When?

543
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:49,472
It's been 3 or 5 minutes maybe.
Right Veysel?

544
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:55,518
- Yes sir, just happened.
- You don't have such authority.

545
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,473
No I do.

546
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,114
You know what this means don't you?

547
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,558
Yes I know Ms. Ceyda.

548
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,157
I see dear governor.
Excuse me.

549
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,752
You are excused.

550
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:31,758
- Bro, I think this will finish by tomorrow.
- I think so too.

551
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,793
What happened bro?

552
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:48,068
I am so glad you are here. If not,
I wouldn't be able to handle it.

553
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,235
- Coffee?
- Please.

554
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,525
Sir, didn't happen.

555
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,870
It is impossible to persuade him,
unfortunately this is I could do.

556
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,797
Yes sir, you too.

557
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,520
I'm hungry. How nice it would have been
to have a watermelon and some cheese.

558
00:50:55,555 --> 00:50:58,193
Ok. Your food will be
ready in an hour.

559
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,640
Why didn't eat from the delivery food
son, why are you torturing the girl.

560
00:51:01,675 --> 00:51:03,073
I am not hungry yet bro.

561
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,240
- You mean you are spoiled.
- That too.

562
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,669
Yes.

563
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,552
What?

564
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,397
Understood.

565
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,148
Sarp!

566
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,633
Sarp!

567
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,318
Ömer bro, help me.

568
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:37,914
Ayþe.

569
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:52,830
Ayþe.

570
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,117
Ömer bro, do something.

571
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,954
Ayþe...

572
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,553
Bro bro... Hold me, I am going down.

573
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,590
Bro bro, I am here bro.

574
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,870
Bro I am here, I'm here bro.

575
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,751
Bro. Answer me for god's sake.

576
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,075
Did you hear what that woman just said?
I don't have the authority.

577
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,670
Like I was going to learn
authority from you.

578
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,356
- Not at all sir...
- Not at all of course.

579
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,193
What is it again?

580
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,152
Dear governor.

581
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,240
Dear governor, dear governor.

582
00:55:03,275 --> 00:55:04,639
Dear governor.

583
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,992
Dear governor.

584
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,192
Dear governor.

585
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,325
Bro please don't die, please don't.

586
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,080
Sarp, hold this and
tie it up to the machine.

587
00:55:35,115 --> 00:55:37,230
Send it quick.

588
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,269
Extraordinary problems has
extraordinary solutions Ceyda.

589
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,360
Sir maybe so, but I am not sure
if this much was needed or not.

590
00:56:49,395 --> 00:56:52,750
You can be sure! Big steps
are taken in big projects.

591
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:56,833
Sometimes it's necessary to sacrifice
some people, no big deal.

592
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,360
Yes but the death of two engineers
in the same region?

593
00:57:00,395 --> 00:57:02,191
Call it an uncertain death.

594
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:08,360
But won't uncertain death will make it
harder to get the designation for the land?

595
00:57:08,395 --> 00:57:12,876
Contrary, it will speed it up.
We cut the problem from the root.

596
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:22,953
Thousands of people died in Chile.
One of them was a head of state.

597
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:29,916
The whole world knew him
and no one even knows your MTA manager.

598
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,509
You know what's the best characteristics
of Turkish people that I love?

599
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:41,550
You forget quick. No one will remember
any of these after 3 days.

600
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,752
I see.

601
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,357
Where is my son?

602
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,791
Where is Ömer?

603
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,475
I am sorry Remzi dad.

604
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,672
Where is Ömer?

605
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,599
- Dad...
- Where is your brother?

606
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,830
Come on Remzi dad sit here.

607
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,515
Where is Ömer?
Take me to my Ömer!

608
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:28,152
What are you looking at Ugur?

609
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,118
Chief.

610
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,034
Chief.

611
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,040
Some of the screws that were holding this
steel bulk are spilled all over the place.

612
01:00:41,075 --> 01:00:45,640
But the rest is in its place. But they
are bent towards opposite directions.

613
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:46,868
Give me that.

614
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,920
Look around, let's see if there is any
key or something to open the screws.

615
01:01:17,955 --> 01:01:18,645
Yes sir.

616
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,750
Chief, do you think it is homicide?

617
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,832
- Is there something?
- Yes chief.

618
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,672
A woman's glasses.

619
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:31,040
- I think it's Ms. Ayþe's.
- Should we take it chief?

620
01:01:31,075 --> 01:01:33,554
- What time is it?
- 11:45 a. m.

621
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,598
My shitty head! If you find
anything update me.

622
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,845
I will try to make it to the funeral.

623
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,200
Turn this place upside down, every inch,
and keep your mouth shut.

624
01:01:41,235 --> 01:01:42,553
Yes chief.

625
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,672
Let's pray for the decedent's soul.

626
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,033
My son.

627
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,871
My brave one.

628
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,552
Ömer...

629
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,510
This soil is yours.

630
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:25,033
It's your land now.
I didn't separate you from your soil.

631
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:46,512
This village's river's water.

632
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:50,440
We had washed you with
your deceased mother...

633
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:54,911
...when you were born. Your life water.

634
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,591
Accept it son.

635
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:35,276
Death, where are you?
Which wrong are you knocking I wonder.

636
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,592
Dad we are here.

637
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,113
Dad.

638
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:13,589
The scent of my Ömer,
scent of my Ömer.

639
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,720
Scent of my Ömer.

640
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,793
Ömer...

641
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:37,397
Dad. Dad don't.

642
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,231
I'm fed up Melek.

643
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:33,550
I'm fed up from losing
the people I love.

644
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:41,029
I'm tired of burying them
with my own hands.

645
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,710
I know my dear.

646
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,713
I lost a lifelong friend.

647
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,718
I can't stand it no more.

648
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:19,560
After this point, every way to go
are the same. If I don't have my Ömer.

649
01:09:19,595 --> 01:09:26,113
I will wait for my day in my house, my soil.

650
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:47,634
Dad...
There is no going like this.

651
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,993
What happened to your hand?

652
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:24,069
That day... when I was trying...

653
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,230
When will you be back?

654
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,636
I don't know, don't know.

655
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:11,272
Dear... I'm so sorry again.

656
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,990
I love you...

657
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,552
Welcome.

658
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,595
- You did a good job.
- Shut up.

659
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:23,196
Calm down.

660
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,271
Why are we here?

661
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,636
Are you scared?

662
01:13:32,360 --> 01:13:34,078
Yes I am.

663
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:40,914
I was scared of you, from
myself, I was. When is the flight?

664
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:47,113
- We'll leave soon. Was it your first?
- What first?

665
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,554
First time that you killed someone?

666
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:56,845
Things that are offered to you,
your life standard.

667
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:02,159
What do I have? What was offered to me?
I don't even have a life on my own.

668
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:11,040
You are wrong. You do have your own
life and you choose what to live.

669
01:14:11,075 --> 01:14:14,589
What do you say?
Did I want to kill Sarp's bro.

670
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:23,635
Look, questions that you are not supposed to
ask will have answers that won't satisfy you.

671
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,231
You are an employee, and
you do whatever duty is given to you...

672
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:32,348
...and keep on living your daily life.
Be aware of what you are in.

673
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,800
I am but you should be aware of this.

674
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,075
Since I came back to Turkey, I succeed
every mission that was given to me.

675
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:44,557
Collecting information from the school
and from the computer of the man I sleep...

676
01:14:44,592 --> 01:14:48,595
...with every night a murder in a business
center that had security like an army.

677
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,916
Whatever the mission was,
I did it successfully.

678
01:14:52,600 --> 01:15:00,632
But this last one. Ömer bro. Why did I
have to do it why did you make me do it.

679
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,594
Police, clean up and disappear.

680
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,553
Yes, I wish it wasn't this way...

681
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:13,954
...but it was and the life you
think you don't own keeps going.

682
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:19,271
- You need to forget this.
- I need forget it.

683
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:28,868
Mr. Peterson organized a party
for you and is waiting impatiently.

684
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:31,470
Ok then let's go.

685
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:33,191
Stop!

686
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,277
What are you suspicious of Tahir?

687
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,351
The glasses dear governor.

688
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,085
Is there something?

689
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,395
Yes chief, a woman's eyeglasses.

690
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:07,280
Ms. Ayþe's probably,
I will try to catch the funeral.

691
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:09,350
- Should we take it chief?
- No, I'll handle it.

692
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:49,669
Since I came back to Turkey, I succeed
every mission that was given to me.

693
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:53,196
Collecting information from the school
and from the computer of the man I sleep...

694
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:58,628
...with everynight a murder in a business
center that had security like an army.

695
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,669
Whatever the mission was,
I did it successfully.

696
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:19,631
Agents keep living their lives
after a certain training period.

697
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:23,754
Organization activates
them whenever it wants.

698
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:26,195
I will prepare my baggage.

699
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,558
You are coming too?

700
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:35,309
I don't think it's the right time Ayþe.

701
01:19:39,640 --> 01:19:42,598
- I can get into the wells too.
- Ok Ayþe Ok.

702
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:47,875
You mean my brother's murderer is...

703
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,834
Understood.

704
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,118
Ömer bro. Help.

705
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,115
And the marble factory.

706
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,553
What was it really about.

707
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,518
For now an old minister.

708
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:44,285
The consultant of the factory that
belongs to the organization...

709
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:49,155
...if they let us to work on it, other thing
might come up as well dear governor.

710
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:55,273
- If you excuse me I need to
go the headquarters. - Sure Tahir go, go.

711
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,955
I will come to see the manager anyways.

712
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,715
- May god give you patience.
- Thanks.

713
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,833
Thanks.

714
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:42,829
What kind of a world is this Faruk
bro. The woman you love betrays you...

715
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,909
...and you pay it by
losing your brother.

716
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:53,597
The one who betrays doesn't
have a right to choose who to betray.

717
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:59,357
A month later.

718
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,070
Yes dear minister, I am about leave soon.

719
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:07,430
There's lots of information. A big
organization is surfacing from the tragedy.

720
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:10,553
And unfortunately, some government
officials are involved in it too.

721
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,315
All of them are documented sir,
all of them.

722
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:23,280
The most important one is the flag. I took
over from honorable people 15 years ago.

723
01:22:23,315 --> 01:22:26,033
Wait wait Faruk, are you?

724
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:31,830
Yes sir, I exactly mean that... exactly...

725
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:35,990
Unless the road signs fool me and cause
me to end up in the opposite lane...

726
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,205
...I will be with you
before the night falls.

727
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:41,312
What are you thinking?
What do you have in your hand?

728
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:45,638
For now, I can say that it's not
an accident as it seems.

729
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:48,035
Faruk if it is not then...

730
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:54,480
Yes dear minister, it's like that.
If the documents I have won't be enough.

731
01:22:54,515 --> 01:22:56,365
I am ready so resign in your presence.

732
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,756
I am calling the prime minister right
now and will inform him on this.

733
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,079
I will see you tonight.

734
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,351
However you'd like dear minister.

735
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:09,958
I will be careful dear minister,
don't worry I will be.

736
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:20,273
Connect me to the line
of prime minister's office.

737
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,914
Sir, I will bother you later on.

738
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,952
Excuse me sir.

739
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:37,320
- Dear governor.
- Come veysel come.

740
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,272
- Is everything ready?
- Yes sir.

741
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,960
I checked every document twice sir.

742
01:23:40,995 --> 01:23:42,279
Ok then.

743
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:48,885
If only we can solve this
case without messing it up.

744
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:52,435
The account responsible for all the
sorrows will be closed right dear governer.

745
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,709
Yes it will Veysel, it will.

746
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:02,310
It won't bring back gone people maybe,
but the case will close.

747
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:08,075
Yes Mr. Veysel... this place is
under your safekeeping.

748
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:12,836
Don't worry about here sir,
just arrive there safe that's it.

749
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:16,318
Thanks Veysel.

750
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:22,993
My long journey friend.

751
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,510
Come on come on.

752
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,319
- Lady Melek, what's the occasion?
- Good.

753
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:34,640
You didn't sleep last night didn't eat
anything either. It didn't feel right.

754
01:25:34,675 --> 01:25:38,030
I made little something...
you can eat on the road.

755
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,389
Yilmaz.

756
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:01,872
- Yes, traveller needs to be on the road.
- Come on

757
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,478
- Melek!
- Faruk!

758
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:09,755
May your roads be open.

759
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,318
Ok then.

760
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:19,388
Governor Vali Faruk Yazici lost his life
after staying in coma for 6 days.

761
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:25,520
The documents inside his briefcase are
still missing despite all searching efforts.

762
01:29:25,555 --> 01:29:28,353
The End
