1
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,556
Charlotte is off
to a violent start in 2019

2
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,256
with more homicides in
the first month of a year

3
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,456
than we've seen in decades.

4
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,386
Homicide's not taking a break

5
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,646
this holiday weekend.

6
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,497
It's unfortunate.

7
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,456
In three days,
three people killed

8
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,326
in three separate crimes in Charlotte.

9
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,896
First, a person shot to death

10
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,666
in a luxury apartment complex

11
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,026
in the heart of uptown.

12
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,076
Then a body discovered in
a grocery store parking lot

13
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,506
in University City,

14
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,423
and now,

15
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,146
a man shot and killed in a motel room.

16
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,606
Right after the teen was killed,

17
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,365
shots rang out at the crime scene,

18
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,596
Sending police, passersby,
even our own news crew

19
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,053
ducking for cover.

20
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,026
Four people killed in four
shootings this weekend alone.

21
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,306
Out with new crime stats.

22
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,756
Overall violent crime is up 11%.

23
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,434
You can see homicide's up
the most, a whopping 230%.

24
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,693
Police say most of the
incidents involve teens,

25
00:03:18,717 --> 00:03:21,283
oftentime repeat offenders
who are responsible.

26
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:24,416
Officers say many times victims
are not always willing to

27
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,876
help put the crooks behind
bars before it's too late.

28
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,546
A call coming in at 5:43 am

29
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,396
for a shooting on Ohaus
Court in north Charlotte.

30
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,326
I heard six rounds go off.

31
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,016
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

32
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,236
Police say the gunfire
came from outside the house.

33
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,736
Violent crime in Charlotte,

34
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,386
well, we found out today what
everyone has already known.

35
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,154
Numbers of violent crimes,
including homicides

36
00:03:47,178 --> 00:03:49,446
way up in the Queen City.

37
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,377
Homicides.

38
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:51,396
Oh my God.

39
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,786
Now up to 35 this year.

40
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,916
All of a sudden I just heard gunfire.

41
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,023
Many of them still unsolved.

42
00:03:58,047 --> 00:03:59,007
If you a man and you did it,

43
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,713
be a man and man up and say you did it.

44
00:04:00,737 --> 00:04:01,986
I just want justice.

45
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,796
These killings
keeping Charlotte on a

46
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,156
record-breaking road,

47
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,123
on track to have one of
the deadliest years ever.

48
00:08:07,335 --> 00:08:08,168
Shit.

49
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,541

And that's it.

735
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,096
You ain't got nothing on KB?

736
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,376

Get some bitches together.

745
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,516
We don't have enough money.

746
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,756
We broke.

747
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,929
Is there any way we
can talk about a budget

748
00:46:21,953 --> 00:46:23,696
on what we're trying to get done?

749
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,529
A budget?

750
00:46:24,553 --> 00:46:25,363
At least 50 thousand.

751
00:46:25,387 --> 00:46:27,066
They're killing everybody in my city,

752
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,146

753
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:32,009

Bird mother fucking county.

00:46:32,033 --> 00:46:34,196
You know what I'm detecting with y'all?

755
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,506
I'm detecting a whole bunch of bullshit.

756
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:39,016
So, if y'all don't get
me no evidence soon,

And how to break these cases.

766
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,606
That's what you need to
put in the God damn song.

767
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,430
But you know what you can do?

768
00:47:46,454 --> 00:47:47,347

See they hanging out

1331
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,038
Same spot where a nigga just got killed.

1332
01:12:10,062 --> 01:12:12,400
Niggas don't care bro.

1333
01:12:12,424 --> 01:12:14,806
We'll deal with that in a minute

1334
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,886

1335
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:18,249
I need to let you in on something.

1336
01:12:18,273 --> 01:12:20,206
I don't need you to do
that shit that you did

1337
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:21,621
in the Captain's office again.

1338
01:12:21,645 --> 01:12:22,848
What you talking about,

01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:24,256

It's that right there, them jokes.

1342
01:12:27,765 --> 01:12:29,846
There's a time and a place for everything

1343
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:31,956
and that's not the place
nor was that the time.

1344

You right, you right.

1345
01:12:32,971 --> 01:12:34,626
If you want him to take us serious,

1346
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,326
we gotta take ourselves serious.

1347
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:37,160
You right man.

1348
01:12:37,184 --> 01:12:39,086
All I wanted to be was a cop.

1349
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:41,072
And that's what I
need you to be is a cop.

1350
01:12:41,096 --> 01:12:44,136
Playing jokes and acting
like everything is a game

1351
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,586
is gonna end us in a situation

1352
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:46,826

1353
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:48,176

1354
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,167
You right.

1355
01:12:49,191 --> 01:12:51,032

1357
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:54,086

1358
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:56,916

1372
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:17,749

I heard about it but
I ain't do that shit.

1377
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:24,462
I don't know nothing about that.

1378
01:13:24,486 --> 01:13:27,240
You got any drugs, any
guns, any weapons on you?

1379
01:13:27,264 --> 01:13:29,640
I ain't trying to get stabbed

1380
01:13:29,664 --> 01:13:30,531
Spread 'em, spread 'em, spread 'em good.

1381
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:37,141
This mother fucker got a screwdriver.

1382
01:13:37,165 --> 01:13:37,975
What he doing?

1383
01:13:37,999 --> 01:13:39,221
Fixing bicycles with it?

1384
01:13:39,245 --> 01:13:40,100
Turn your ass around.

1385
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:41,210
What are you doing with a screwdriver?

1386
01:13:41,234 --> 01:13:42,062
I coulda got stabbed with this.

1387
01:13:44,544 --> 01:13:45,354
What's your name?

1388
01:13:47,165 --> 01:13:48,506
You don't know nothing

I heard about it but
I ain't do that shit.

01:13:52,947 --> 01:13:54,360
I can't chill out this mother fucker?

1393
01:13:54,384 --> 01:13:57,250
Get your ass out of this piece.

1394
01:13:57,274 --> 01:13:59,310
Hey, hey, hey!

1395
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:00,936

Fix your bicycle.

1397
01:14:03,232 --> 01:14:04,786
Sick of this shit.

1398
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:06,640
We gotta catch this mother fucker.

1399
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:14,887
Peace God, what's the signs with you?

1400
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,262

Yeah we blessed today.

1403
01:14:21,513 --> 01:14:22,920
Add three more ciphers to that.

1404
01:14:24,776 --> 01:14:25,585
Peace God.

1405
01:14:25,609 --> 01:14:26,516
You did the knowledge and
that situation that we built

1406
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:27,422
on the past day?

1407
01:14:30,444 --> 01:14:31,337
All right listen,

1408
01:14:31,361 --> 01:14:33,470
you know and understand right
now you got to pull back

1409
01:14:33,494 --> 01:14:35,236
from everything that you're doing.

1410
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:38,126
I do got to step back and
put somebody else in the plate.

1411
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:40,356
But I'm thinking about
leaving it all alone, man.

1412
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:41,190
You know what I mean

1413
01:14:41,214 --> 01:14:43,246
'cause there's too much
stuff going on right now.

1414
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:44,678
Listen, God, you got to
know and understand one thing.

1415
01:14:44,702 --> 01:14:47,446
You know that flag that you
wearing right there, man?

1416
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:49,800
That's a universal flag
when and what it stand for.

1417
01:14:49,824 --> 01:14:52,696
Also right about now you
got to see that's here.

1418
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:55,976
So all that master cipher,
that's going to come in some way,

1419
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,376
some form of fashion, you got
too much hustle on your body.

1420
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,357
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1421
01:14:59,381 --> 01:15:00,872
You also got a queen that stand by you.

1422
01:15:00,896 --> 01:15:04,016
You can pull back and
let your team go forward.

1423
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:04,850
You understand what I'm saying?

1424
01:15:04,874 --> 01:15:07,066
You got to know and understand
like today's mathematics

1425
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:09,046
wisdom sight for all
being a born of wisdom.

1426
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:12,326
So do this wisdom is wise
words spoken by a wise man,

1427
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:15,046
but down dealing with supreme
alphabet that's wisdom,

1428
01:15:15,070 --> 01:15:17,676
cipher that shows the proof,
the truth in the square.

1429
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:19,546
And you are that man
that's within that square.

1430
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:21,646
So you hold all that in
your palm of your hands.

1431
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:22,552
You feel me?

1432
01:15:23,674 --> 01:15:25,276
Aight man, the ball in your court,

1433
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:28,726
but you got to make
some type of move ASAP.

1434
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:31,786
Yeah, God, one more thing I
wanted to build on your with.

1435
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:33,906
No nephew, boy?

1436
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:34,842
Why what's up?

1437
01:15:34,866 --> 01:15:36,746
He got a show coming up,

1438
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:39,050
but he got to go to the
radio station tomorrow,

1439
01:15:39,074 --> 01:15:42,086
but I need you to DJ for me at the show.

1440
01:15:42,110 --> 01:15:42,919
Let's say less man,

1441
01:15:42,943 --> 01:15:43,752
you know I'm gonna be right there

1442
01:15:43,776 --> 01:15:44,586
doing what I gotta do, man.

1443
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:46,626
I'ma put that divine justice down for it.

1444
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:47,967
Say less peace God.

1445
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:53,793
Come in.

1446
01:15:56,730 --> 01:15:57,821
What's happening Captain?

1447
01:15:57,845 --> 01:16:00,996
Aight, where your partner
at Detective Coffee and Donut?

1448
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:03,456
I just dropped him off at the house.

1449
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,297
He was sick,

1450
01:16:04,321 --> 01:16:05,519
throwing up all over the place.

1451
01:16:05,543 --> 01:16:07,941
So, I just came up here to figure out

1452
01:16:07,965 --> 01:16:09,836
where we at and let you
know what we've got.

1453
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:11,240
Oh I guess he ate something out there

1454
01:16:11,264 --> 01:16:13,512
at the Sugar Shack huh?

1455
01:16:13,536 --> 01:16:14,451
I don't know.

1456
01:16:14,475 --> 01:16:15,956
Them pieces of bad butt.

1457
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:18,390
Tom Bone been heard about
slinging that bone around,

1458
01:16:18,414 --> 01:16:20,866
but he'd been throwing
it at the wrong bitches.

1459
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:22,440
Some rabid bitches.

1460
01:16:22,464 --> 01:16:23,469
I don't know nothing about that.

1461
01:16:23,493 --> 01:16:24,586
Okay.

1462
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:26,490
Trying to figure out what's
going on up here, Captain.

1463
01:16:26,514 --> 01:16:27,401
All right, well I'm gonna let you know.

1464
01:16:27,425 --> 01:16:29,753
Well, Officer Dan been doing a little more

1465
01:16:29,777 --> 01:16:31,786
than what y'all been doing.

1466
01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:33,946
He came through and let me know these two,

1467
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:35,096
they got something to do with that murder

1468
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:37,160
over there in Lakeview on Jones Street.

1469
01:16:37,184 --> 01:16:38,866
You think they got anything
to do with that stabbing

1470
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:39,700
that happened over there?

1471
01:16:39,724 --> 01:16:41,581
I don't know nothing about no stabbing.

1472
01:16:41,605 --> 01:16:46,409
'Cause they dropping bodies
after body, after body.

1473
01:16:46,433 --> 01:16:49,686
That's why I need y'all to
do some real detective work.

1474
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:51,306
Bring them in for questioning

1475
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:53,840
and that way we can figure
out what's really going on.

1476
01:16:53,864 --> 01:16:54,673
Aight.

1477
01:16:54,697 --> 01:16:55,530
Look at 'em.

1478
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,826
How about these guys over here?

1479
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:00,030
We got anything else on them

1480
01:17:00,054 --> 01:17:01,806

1481
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:03,956
Ain't got a word.

01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:06,676

01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:07,631

1485
01:17:09,662 --> 01:17:10,471

01:17:10,495 --> 01:17:11,305

1488
01:17:13,303 --> 01:17:14,461

1489
01:17:14,485 --> 01:17:15,902
Get the hell out.

1490
01:17:19,365 --> 01:17:20,217
Don't let the doorknob hit you

1491
01:17:20,241 --> 01:17:22,273

1492
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:24,766
Next we gonna get into this new record.

1493
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:26,676

1494
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:27,510

1498
01:17:33,003 --> 01:17:35,032
He's up in New York making a lot of moves.

1499
01:17:35,056 --> 01:17:37,976
So, me and him came up with the song man

1500
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,286
and just something we
threw on the internet

1501
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:41,946
and it took off with a mind of its own,

1502
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:42,780
you know what I'm saying?

1503
01:17:42,804 --> 01:17:44,680

01:17:49,584 --> 01:17:50,394

01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:00,716
you know what I'm saying?

1513
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:02,936
So the generation before me,

1514
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:04,080
they made no way for me.

1515
01:18:04,104 --> 01:18:06,006
So I had to make a way for me

1516
01:18:06,030 --> 01:18:07,470
and the generation coming after me.

1517
01:18:07,494 --> 01:18:09,026
Time waits for no man.

1518
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:09,859
Time waits for no woman.

1519
01:18:09,883 --> 01:18:10,697
