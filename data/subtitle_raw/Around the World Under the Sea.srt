1
00:03:20,423 --> 00:03:22,077
How deep is he now?
- 400 feet.

2
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,747
Craig, Doug here.
How are you doing, boy?

3
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:43,882
I'm switching over to O-2-3,
I'll turn up from there

4
00:03:43,969 --> 00:03:46,145
and then we'll have
a sonar check, out.

5
00:03:46,232 --> 00:03:47,799
'Okay, steady to go, boy.'

6
00:03:51,672 --> 00:03:52,717
Hello, beautiful.

7
00:03:59,985 --> 00:04:02,074
What about that chopper,
they are still waiting

8
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:03,423
for my permission
to come aboard.

9
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,294
I'll talk to them.

10
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:08,646
Doug here. Brinkman, if we
slow down and take you aboard

11
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:10,343
we'll lose contact below.

12
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,606
Then please terminate
your mission and ask Dr. Mosby

13
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:15,130
to surface at once.
I'm taking you both back

14
00:04:15,217 --> 00:04:18,177
to Federal Science Council
in Washington, urgent.

15
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:21,397
Oh, right in the middle
of a test. Yeah alright, okay.

16
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:22,572
Hey, look.

17
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:33,975
Craig?
- Yeah, go ahead, Doug.

18
00:04:34,062 --> 00:04:36,412
I want you to surface,
but there's a pod of whales

19
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:39,633
above you, so maintain present
depth now until I tell you.

20
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,679
Roger, Doug.
I'll maintain this depth.

21
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:43,158
Watch out
for those whales now.

22
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:44,682
Yeah, Doug, I'm watching.

23
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:54,082
Must be headed for their
breeding lagoons.

24
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,431
Let's drop closer.

25
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:00,741
What's he doing?
That'll make 'em dive.

26
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:05,354
Get me the chopper.

27
00:05:08,444 --> 00:05:10,011
It's too late,
he's spooked 'em.

28
00:05:30,118 --> 00:05:32,468
Alright, come up now, Craig.
The whales have passed.

29
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:36,516
How do you do, Craig?
- Stand by, Doug.

30
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,136
Craig!

31
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,138
Doug, I'm taking water in.

32
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,967
You build up air pressure?
- Roger, that's a maximum.

33
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:56,144
Then abandon.
- I'm coming up fast. Hang on.

34
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,712
I said abandon.
Get out of there, you hear?

35
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:01,802
I can't, the hatch's stuck.
Left a dent from the collision.

36
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:03,673
Break out the floatation gear.

37
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:05,545
Underwater team, on the double.
Man your station.

38
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,504
How deep is he?
- 150 feet.

39
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:10,376
Don't go away, pal,
I'll be right down.

40
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:23,693
That's it. Give me a wrench.

41
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:27,741
I'll start off.
You follow me down.

42
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:29,482
Give me my air down below.

43
00:08:58,065 --> 00:08:59,414
Rat!

44
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,725
Be quiet, they're not rats.
They're guinea pigs.

45
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:07,074
Hold these.

46
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,558
Got you, come here.

47
00:09:14,603 --> 00:09:15,691
Craig, come on.

48
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:22,611
I've caught them all.
- Well, that's nice.

49
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:24,309
We've got work
to do, boy.

50
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:27,007
I'm sorry, I have to go.
- The guinea pigs.

51
00:09:27,094 --> 00:09:28,269
Oh, yes.

52
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:31,707
You Americans,
always in such a hurry.

53
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:39,324
'Of death and destruction
on a worldwide rampage'

54
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:42,370
'these films show the tragic
effects of a tidal wave'

55
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,937
'on a population centre.'

56
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:50,117
How do we relate this?
- Had to start because of him.

57
00:09:50,204 --> 00:09:52,206
Who's that?
- The vice president.

58
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:57,646
Vice President.

59
00:10:06,568 --> 00:10:10,007
'Giant waves strike in costal
cities first and always catching

60
00:10:10,094 --> 00:10:13,314
the population unaware
and unprotected.'

61
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:16,230
'Although three fourths of all
earthquakes originate beneath'

62
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:19,799
'the oceans, cities far in-land
cannot escape devastation.'

63
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:26,110
'This Turkish city,
hundreds of miles from the coast

64
00:10:26,197 --> 00:10:29,939
'was struck by a quake
lasting only 27 seconds'

65
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:33,639
'taking a toll of
15,000 lives.'

66
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:37,251
'As the casualty lists grow, the
pattern of earthquake activity'

67
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:40,124
'becomes clearer and
the need for scientific study'

68
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:42,039
'and action becomes imperative.'

69
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:51,918
All of these earthquakes,
Mr. Vice President

70
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:54,834
have happened during the first
few months of this year.

71
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:58,229
Six times the average number,
three times the average strength

72
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:00,840
and we feel there are more
coming of greater intensity.

73
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:03,408
Is there any way
to foretell, where or when?

74
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:06,237
Professor Hamaru has developed
a theory of forecasting.

75
00:11:10,023 --> 00:11:13,331
Sir, we cannot prevent
earth or sea quakes.

76
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:16,073
But we can erect
a warning system.

77
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,032
We have a new vehicle,
The Hydronaut

78
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:21,339
which is capable of
establishing that system.

79
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:23,471
Did she prove that
on her shake down?

80
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,387
I don't know, it just returned,
little scarred from a typhoon.

81
00:11:26,474 --> 00:11:30,739
But with a perfect score.
She was tested at 26,000 feet.

82
00:11:30,826 --> 00:11:33,046
She's fully automatic
and can circle the globe

83
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:35,222
on one cartridge
of nuclear fuel.

84
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:38,312
The Hydronaut was built along
lines of Dr. Doug Standish

85
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,009
and engineered
by Dr. Craig Mosby.

86
00:11:40,097 --> 00:11:42,751
Mr. Vice President.
- How are you, sir?

87
00:11:42,838 --> 00:11:45,754
I'm glad you got here,
I heard it wasn't easy.

88
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:48,583
Well, I had help.

89
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,151
This warning system, once
established around the world

90
00:11:51,238 --> 00:11:53,501
would give us time
to evacuate the cities

91
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,417
if an earthquake with an
intensity of the one in Alaska

92
00:11:56,504 --> 00:12:00,987
were to hit Japan without
warning, millions would die.

93
00:12:01,074 --> 00:12:03,511
This is the warning device.
It's so sensitive

94
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,252
that before an
earthquake happens

95
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,950
before it's seen or heard,
this device senses it.

96
00:12:08,037 --> 00:12:10,083
Obviously, we call
it a sensor.

97
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,390
The sensing devices are all
on this section here.

98
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:15,175
'Let me show it to you.'

99
00:12:15,262 --> 00:12:19,397
These...veins here
will transmit the information

100
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:21,442
to a seismographic centre.

101
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:25,446
And down below...in here

102
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:29,798
is an explosive charge
that anchors this device

103
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:32,497
in place on
the ocean floor.

104
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:36,457
Now, Mr. Vice President,
if we plant these sensors

105
00:12:36,544 --> 00:12:39,895
around the world under the sea,
then pressure points along here

106
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:43,072
and through here and anchor
them in the crust of the earth

107
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,379
we'll have the early
warning system we need.

108
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:48,643
Well, this means a great deal
of risk, doesn't it?

109
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,733
We know less about the oceans
than we do the moon.

110
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,431
You're willing
to take on this risk?

111
00:12:53,518 --> 00:12:55,128
Well, that's why
we're here.

112
00:12:55,215 --> 00:12:57,304
Gentlemen, I'd like you
to proceed on the assumption

113
00:12:57,391 --> 00:12:59,088
that I can get
the necessary appropriation

114
00:12:59,176 --> 00:13:00,699
for the voyage
of The Hydronaut.

115
00:13:00,786 --> 00:13:01,874
Great.

116
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:39,738
Yeah, we've got pretty good
visibility on this sub.

117
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:42,871
We've got a TV camera topside
and we've got one out there

118
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,960
in the bow
and one under the hull.

119
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:47,441
Watch, let's see
if we can pick up Doug.

120
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:48,660
Ah, there he is.

121
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:50,488
'Look, see him?'

122
00:13:50,575 --> 00:13:52,925
'He's X-raying the hull from
any damage after the typhoon.

123
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:55,275
Should be in,
in a minute or two.

124
00:13:55,362 --> 00:13:58,191
What about that crazy
color on the hull?

125
00:13:58,278 --> 00:14:00,149
It's pretty wild, isn't it?

126
00:14:00,237 --> 00:14:01,890
But it's international
rescue color.

127
00:14:01,977 --> 00:14:04,284
Now, you know, the sub
will change color

128
00:14:04,371 --> 00:14:07,374
as we go deeper, it moves from
yellow red through to green.

129
00:14:07,461 --> 00:14:09,855
What about your crew,
have you decided who you want?

130
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:11,987
Yeah. Now we've got
to have Phil Volker.

131
00:14:12,074 --> 00:14:14,903
He's designed half the
electronic gear on board.

132
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,645
And we decided to go for
Orin Hillyard as the geologist.

133
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,387
But here's where the hang up
comes, we want to combine

134
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:22,476
our doctor and our marine
biologist in one.

135
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:25,914
Doug and I don't agree on this,
I wanna go for Bob Johnson.

136
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:28,047
Yup, I'm for a new comer
on the field.

137
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:29,353
Hello there, Gus.
- Hi, doctor.

138
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,789
Nice to see you.

139
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:32,399
He's done some
very impressive research

140
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:35,010
in Marine Biology.
M.E. Hanford, from England.

141
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:37,099
I'm sure you've read
some of his published material

142
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:38,492
the last couple of years.

143
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:40,581
Her material.

144
00:14:40,668 --> 00:14:42,148
What?
- What?

145
00:14:42,235 --> 00:14:44,759
The M.E. stands for
Margaret Elizabeth.

146
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:48,328
Very attractive too. She just
finished a research for me.

147
00:14:48,415 --> 00:14:50,287
Now, shall we make it, Johnson?

148
00:14:50,374 --> 00:14:51,984
Why, because
Hanford's a woman?

149
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:54,726
Half the doctors in Russia
are women, not a bad example

150
00:14:54,813 --> 00:14:55,901
for the rest to follow.

151
00:14:55,988 --> 00:14:57,337
He's got a point.

152
00:14:57,424 --> 00:14:59,774
You want a woman on a submarine
for four months?

153
00:14:59,861 --> 00:15:01,646
She's a scientist
and so are we.

154
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,822
Brinkman says you met her
in the science building..

155
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:04,910
...under a desk.

156
00:15:04,997 --> 00:15:06,694
Her?
- That was M.E. Hanford?

157
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,827
What do you say now?
- No! No.

158
00:15:08,914 --> 00:15:10,872
Alright, don't worry,
first we've got to get

159
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,614
Phil Volker and Hank Stahl,
without them we can't start.

160
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:16,095
Stahl, he lives at the bottom
of the Caribbean Bay

161
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:18,097
studying underwater survival,
you'll never get him.

162
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,534
We've got to. At the depth's
we're gonna dive

163
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:23,581
we can't plant our sensors
without his breathing gases.

164
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:26,235
I'll get him, no matter
how deep he is. I'll get him.

165
00:18:12,227 --> 00:18:15,056
Well, Dr. Hamaru is all wrong.
I want no part of it.

166
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:20,018
Well, then we can't do it.

167
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:22,107
I mean it.

168
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:24,544
Without you, it'd be impossible.
No one has your knowledge

169
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:27,199
of breathing gases
at deep pressures.

170
00:18:27,286 --> 00:18:29,680
We've got to be able
to get in and out of the sub.

171
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:32,117
What do you want with
a garage mechanic like me.

172
00:18:32,204 --> 00:18:35,294
I bet you've got guys with fancy
degrees who'll work for you.

173
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:38,427
Yeah, sure. You're just
a big dumb hot head.

174
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:40,865
Dr. Hamaru, warned me
about that line of yours.

175
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:42,736
Well, I am.
I didn't go to college

176
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:45,130
You know how I started
under water?

177
00:18:45,217 --> 00:18:49,003
Cropping keel for buck fifty
an hour, learn or drown.

178
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,223
You can give us all lessons.
- Soft soap.

179
00:18:53,181 --> 00:18:54,792
Is it...rabbits underwater?

180
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:58,709
How did you accomplish this?

181
00:18:58,796 --> 00:19:01,625
Oh, that's
an artificial gill..

182
00:19:01,712 --> 00:19:05,063
...that allows them
to breathe underwater.

183
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:08,196
There's no garage mechanic, eh?

184
00:19:08,283 --> 00:19:10,503
Now this, what's this?
- Uh.

185
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,463
Oh, these are embryo's,
shark embryo's.

186
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:16,857
'They're called swell shark'

187
00:19:16,944 --> 00:19:20,034
Here, look. Right there.
See him turning around?

188
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:30,523
See, he's trying to free himself
from the nourishing egg yolk.

189
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,482
'There, see. He's trying
to break the umbilical cord.'

190
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,397
'They always do that
just before they hatch.'

191
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:37,443
See him fighting
to get out of there?

192
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,576
'Look at that strength,
he wants to be born.'

193
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:45,886
How's that for
their will to live?

194
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:47,627
What about people,
their will to live?

195
00:19:47,714 --> 00:19:48,976
The millions who'll die

196
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,109
if we don't put down
our warning system.

197
00:19:51,196 --> 00:19:53,459
People! Sharks, animals, they
kill each other for reason

198
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:54,852
because they're hungry.

199
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:56,462
People kill each other
for nothing.

200
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:59,291
Wait a minute. There might be
some people like that.

201
00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:01,293
It doesn't apply
to the whole human race.

202
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,035
Boren was right.
He did say you're hard to reach.

203
00:20:04,122 --> 00:20:06,167
You let me in.
I haven't reached you yet.

204
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:08,256
Go ahead and reach me.

205
00:20:08,343 --> 00:20:10,868
Alright. What about yourself?
You are people.

206
00:20:10,955 --> 00:20:13,610
You know that you built your
house over an earthquake fault

207
00:20:13,697 --> 00:20:15,742
that you're about 50 miles
from the Martinique Volcano?

208
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:19,050
If we complete our system, we
can give you an advance warning.

209
00:20:19,137 --> 00:20:21,879
I couldn't care less, doctor.
Let 'em all go.

210
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:24,316
You don't mean that.

211
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:28,102
Well, maybe there are
a few human beings up there.

212
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:31,671
Dr. Hamaru, Gus Boren..

213
00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:35,632
...Dmitri, my crazy Russian
chess-playing friend.

214
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:40,637
Hey, Dmitri. I just moved
my bishop from D2 to F4.

215
00:20:40,724 --> 00:20:42,987
Let's see you get
out of that one.

216
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:45,859
Shortwave.
It's his move.

217
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:47,208
It's your move, Mr. Stahl.

218
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,649
I couldn't care less.

219
00:20:52,736 --> 00:20:56,130
I got it made done here. I got
my research, my books, my music.

220
00:20:56,217 --> 00:20:59,177
Why'd I leave for idiots
who'll blow themselves up?

221
00:20:59,264 --> 00:21:01,092
You really think you can keep
on escaping like this?

222
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:03,572
That it's not going
to bother your conscience.

223
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,618
Conscience, doctor?
What conscience?

224
00:21:05,705 --> 00:21:06,837
You've got one.

225
00:21:08,665 --> 00:21:10,057
Here.

226
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:16,107
This'll help you
get back home safely.

227
00:21:17,064 --> 00:21:18,718
To civilization.

228
00:21:18,805 --> 00:21:20,807
No, thanks. I wouldn't want
to salve your conscience.

229
00:21:20,894 --> 00:21:22,722
You'll never make it
without my breathing gas.

230
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:24,550
And you know it.
- That's right.

231
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:28,336
Don't gamble on me coming out
after you, 'cause I wont.

232
00:21:28,423 --> 00:21:31,339
I can't believe that a man with
your intelligence will let

233
00:21:31,426 --> 00:21:34,603
a few million people die when
he could keep it from happening.

234
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:37,171
I'm talking about you. You don't
have enough air in your tanks.

235
00:21:37,258 --> 00:21:38,869
What difference
does it make?

236
00:21:38,956 --> 00:21:41,262
I'm not on your preferred list
of people worth saving, am I?

237
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:44,962
Here's a man who is. I don't
think you even read this.

238
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:46,833
"Japan has borne seven
cataclysms from the sea

239
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,836
"in 29 years. If the one
which I fear is coming

240
00:21:49,923 --> 00:21:51,577
"strikes my country,
my dear Hank

241
00:21:51,664 --> 00:21:53,666
it'll be worse than Hiroshima."

242
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,858
What the hell's
the matter with you?

243
00:25:05,945 --> 00:25:07,904
Trying to kill yourself?

244
00:25:07,991 --> 00:25:11,168
No, I knew
you'd come through.

245
00:25:11,255 --> 00:25:12,909
Well, just in case,
you didn't.

246
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:22,005
Of all the lousy tricks!

247
00:25:22,092 --> 00:25:24,137
You had that thing
on top of you all the time?

248
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,835
I'm sorry. But you
left me no alternative.

249
00:25:28,881 --> 00:25:30,448
Now that you've come
this far

250
00:25:30,535 --> 00:25:32,537
how about going all
the way with this?

251
00:25:32,624 --> 00:25:35,540
'That's a real
floatin' laboratory.'

252
00:25:35,627 --> 00:25:38,456
We've also got the crew.

253
00:25:38,543 --> 00:25:42,373
Well, right now my partner's
working on Orin Hillyard.

254
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,809
At Harper Island.

255
00:25:53,906 --> 00:25:55,386
You'll be alright.

256
00:25:55,473 --> 00:25:59,346
Decompress for 20 minutes
and he'll be back to normal.

257
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,174
Watch me from here.
Close the hatch.

258
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:07,876
Hi, I'm Dr. Craig Mosby.
- Jack Smith.

259
00:26:07,964 --> 00:26:09,443
Hi, Jack, how are you?

260
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,141
I've an appointment
with Orin Hillyard.

261
00:26:11,228 --> 00:26:12,533
Is he still down below?
- Yeah.

262
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,231
Can I go down
and see him?

263
00:26:19,105 --> 00:26:21,455
Sure. Yellow flag's still up.
- Thank you very much.

264
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:28,593
Oh, Jack, you got a lot of
divers in wet suits down there?

265
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,682
Yeah.
- How'll I know who's Orin?

266
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:32,162
You'll know.
- Okay.

267
00:26:41,562 --> 00:26:43,825
'Anything the matter?'
- What?

268
00:26:43,912 --> 00:26:49,309
No, no, uh...could've sworn
I've seen those legs before.

269
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:59,145
Jack.
- Yes.

270
00:26:59,232 --> 00:27:00,886
Was that Dr. Mosby?
- Yeah.

271
00:29:49,446 --> 00:29:50,534
'Lift him easy.'

272
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:00,805
What the hell is
going around here?

273
00:30:00,892 --> 00:30:02,459
'Swing him over.'

274
00:30:02,546 --> 00:30:04,548
'Set him right on
to the deck.'

275
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:05,679
'Easy now.'

276
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,556
Who's the idiot inside
this diving suit?

277
00:30:15,036 --> 00:30:17,517
Dr. Mosby, I presume.

278
00:30:17,604 --> 00:30:19,824
Orin. Orin, what the devil
are you doing?

279
00:30:19,911 --> 00:30:21,956
Oh, we're testing out
some new mining gear.

280
00:30:22,043 --> 00:30:24,481
I wanted you out
of that water fast.

281
00:30:24,568 --> 00:30:25,743
Why?

282
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:41,106
Ha-ha. Thank you.

283
00:30:41,193 --> 00:30:43,282
'Thank you very much.'

284
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:45,328
Oh, Maggie, you know
Craig Mosby?

285
00:30:45,415 --> 00:30:48,592
'Maggie Hanford.'
- Yes, I think we've met.

286
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:51,377
It's nice seeing you again.
- Hello, Dr. Mosby.

287
00:30:51,464 --> 00:30:54,946
Orin, are you alright?
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine. I'm..

288
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:56,252
Excuse me, please.

289
00:30:58,515 --> 00:31:00,256
What's the matter
with her?

290
00:31:00,343 --> 00:31:02,693
We got a phone message
for you from Dr. Boren.

291
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,434
You're first choice
for medic is unavailable

292
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:06,392
and there's no time
to shop around.

293
00:31:06,479 --> 00:31:07,654
We're getting
new tremors.

294
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,395
Oh, yeah, big ones.
- Ah, boy.

295
00:31:09,482 --> 00:31:12,006
Ah, Boren says you've got
to take Maggie

296
00:31:12,093 --> 00:31:13,399
even if you don't
want her.

297
00:31:13,486 --> 00:31:15,488
And, uh, unfortunately

298
00:31:15,575 --> 00:31:19,710
that was the part of
the conversation she overheard.

299
00:31:19,797 --> 00:31:22,582
Well, I better go talk to her.
- Yeah. I think I would.

300
00:31:27,587 --> 00:31:29,676
Dr. Hanford.
- Yes.

301
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:32,723
I'm sorry about that message.
I hope you'll understand.

302
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:36,466
'Let me be the first to welcome
you aboard the Hydronaut.'

303
00:31:36,553 --> 00:31:40,644
Orin and I shall be there. We
already know the starting date.

304
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:42,472
Well?

305
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,083
I hope Doug is having an easier
time recruiting Dr. Volker.

306
00:32:15,505 --> 00:32:17,942
Phil, I'll keep you on
the sonoscope.

307
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:20,379
'How long do you think
you're gonna be?'

308
00:32:20,466 --> 00:32:23,556
We'll be back in half an hour.
- 'I'll keep watching you.'

309
00:32:23,643 --> 00:32:25,950
Phil, will you tell me
why the guided tour

310
00:32:26,037 --> 00:32:29,649
in this half-pint sub of yours?
I've seen all these coral reefs.

311
00:32:29,736 --> 00:32:31,042
Patience.

312
00:32:50,017 --> 00:32:52,846
You know why I'm down here.
Come on, give me an answer.

313
00:32:52,933 --> 00:32:55,980
You came to me with the premise
of a recruiting sergeant.

314
00:32:56,067 --> 00:32:59,418
The least you can do
is to humor me for a few minutes

315
00:32:59,505 --> 00:33:01,464
while I show you
my latest gadgetry.

316
00:33:14,564 --> 00:33:16,653
Apparently, I've
succeeded in establishing

317
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,481
electronic communication
with another specie.

318
00:33:24,051 --> 00:33:26,706
You watch.

319
00:33:30,144 --> 00:33:31,929
I talk.
He learns.

320
00:33:32,016 --> 00:33:34,105
You watch,
I'll make him turn.

321
00:33:36,934 --> 00:33:37,891
To the left.

322
00:33:41,155 --> 00:33:42,635
You need me?

323
00:33:45,072 --> 00:33:47,161
That's right.

324
00:33:47,248 --> 00:33:49,468
Well, I'll come.

325
00:33:49,555 --> 00:33:52,428
At a price.

326
00:33:52,515 --> 00:33:55,343
And just how high
is your price?

327
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:56,475
Look, there's a manta ray.

328
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:19,542
It's attracted
to the color of the submarine.

329
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:21,500
Ha-ha, and the dolphin's
attracted to the manta.

330
00:34:30,074 --> 00:34:31,423
And now..

331
00:34:34,905 --> 00:34:36,341
...the grand finale.

332
00:34:38,778 --> 00:34:40,824
What are you going
to do with the mine?

333
00:34:55,447 --> 00:34:57,014
Now, I'll make him
drop it.

334
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,455
Don't worry. It won't
explode on contact.

335
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,506
Now, he'll pick
it up again.

336
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:20,864
What are you
up to now?

337
00:35:20,951 --> 00:35:22,996
You see the bottom
of that boat up there.

338
00:35:25,695 --> 00:35:28,132
Well?
- Watch.

339
00:35:40,318 --> 00:35:41,406
That is magnetic.

340
00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:46,237
Poor thing.

341
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:48,195
It takes quite
an intelligence to understand

342
00:35:48,282 --> 00:35:50,154
the devious mind
of a human being.

343
00:35:50,241 --> 00:35:51,721
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

344
00:35:51,808 --> 00:35:53,244
Excuse me.

345
00:35:53,331 --> 00:35:56,682
I arm the mine from here.
We head for the surface.

346
00:36:14,178 --> 00:36:15,005
Fifteen seconds.

347
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:19,313
Turn your boat.
You're gonna blow her up?

348
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,186
She looks new.
It $20 worth of paint.

349
00:36:22,273 --> 00:36:24,580
I like to dress up
my demonstrations.

350
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:41,118
Impress you?

351
00:36:41,205 --> 00:36:44,730
Mm-hm. I suppose that's
just what you had in mind.

352
00:36:44,817 --> 00:36:46,079
Why?

353
00:36:46,166 --> 00:36:48,516
I want the Hydronaut
to make one dive for me.

354
00:36:48,604 --> 00:36:50,910
For me, personally.

355
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:53,609
'You personally?
A dive for what?'

356
00:36:53,696 --> 00:36:57,700
To salvage four million dollars
worth of transistor crystals.

357
00:36:57,787 --> 00:36:59,484
You mean a treasure hunt?

358
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:01,442
Phil, I came to talk
to you about people.

359
00:37:01,529 --> 00:37:03,488
Thousands, millions of life.
- That's for you.

360
00:37:03,575 --> 00:37:07,448
I'm talking about millions
of dollars...for me.

361
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:09,625
I don't buy.

362
00:37:09,712 --> 00:37:11,539
I don't go.

363
00:37:11,627 --> 00:37:13,759
Our mission is to
plant warning sensors.

364
00:37:13,846 --> 00:37:16,719
I know that. We take care
of my mission after yours.

365
00:37:16,806 --> 00:37:18,285
I can't commit
the crew.

366
00:37:18,372 --> 00:37:20,374
Don't worry.
How'd you say? Cut them in.

367
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:22,246
What makes you think
they'll go along with you?

368
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:23,769
Haven't you heard?

369
00:37:23,856 --> 00:37:26,554
It's better to be a rich
scientist than a poor one?

370
00:37:26,642 --> 00:37:28,644
If I didn't need you,
I'll tell you

371
00:37:28,731 --> 00:37:30,733
to go to the bottom
of the ocean.

372
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,779
The earth's crust
is crumbling, Douglas.

373
00:37:33,866 --> 00:37:35,346
You've no choice.

374
00:37:38,001 --> 00:37:39,655
We'll leave a week
from today.

375
00:37:50,753 --> 00:37:52,624
Alright, fellas, come on now.

376
00:37:52,711 --> 00:37:54,365
That's not chopped liver.

377
00:37:54,452 --> 00:37:56,193
Get up. Put it on
the floor there.

378
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,760
'Get it loaded.'

379
00:37:57,847 --> 00:37:59,326
'Easy, come on.'

380
00:38:15,038 --> 00:38:18,084
That's a set of whiskers
I haven't seen before.

381
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:20,260
It's hydro electronic.

382
00:38:20,347 --> 00:38:22,349
From below to the surface,
surface to Syncom

383
00:38:22,436 --> 00:38:25,135
Syncom to Washington.
It's quite simple, really.

384
00:38:25,222 --> 00:38:27,746
We're all loaded.
Where's the dame?

385
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:30,618
The dame is exercising
her rights as a lady.

386
00:38:30,706 --> 00:38:32,011
She's late.

387
00:38:49,768 --> 00:38:52,902
Check. Good.
- Okay.

388
00:38:52,989 --> 00:38:54,947
Do you know what's
holding Maggie up?

389
00:38:55,034 --> 00:38:58,429
I understand she's exercising
a dame's right to be late.

390
00:38:58,516 --> 00:39:00,561
We can't sail without
a cook, you know.

391
00:39:00,648 --> 00:39:05,218
Margaret Hanford is as handy
with a skillet as a scalpel.

392
00:39:05,305 --> 00:39:07,394
You, um, you know
Maggie Han?

393
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:14,358
'Hello, there.
A lady coming aboard.'

394
00:39:25,978 --> 00:39:28,241
Hi, how do you do?
We were worried.

395
00:39:28,328 --> 00:39:30,853
Thank you, Orin.

396
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,246
Hello, Dr. Mosby.
- Doctor.

397
00:39:35,727 --> 00:39:37,642
Philip.
- Hello, Maggie.

398
00:39:39,818 --> 00:39:42,255
And you must be Mr. Stahl.
It's a privilege.

399
00:39:42,342 --> 00:39:45,737
Just call me Hank.
- Just call me Maggie, Hank.

400
00:39:45,824 --> 00:39:48,261
Excuse me.
I have to get my hatbox.

401
00:39:48,348 --> 00:39:50,046
Hatbox?
- Hatbox?

402
00:39:53,484 --> 00:39:55,703
Hatbox.

403
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:58,402
You'll love it.
It's absolutely adorable.

404
00:40:02,885 --> 00:40:08,194
Iddie and Biddie.
- Iddie and...Biddie?

405
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:09,674
For oxygen analysis.

406
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:15,636
Well, I see
we're all here now.

407
00:40:15,723 --> 00:40:18,248
It's a real pleasure.
- Thank you.

408
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:19,945
Get into the ward room,
everyone.

409
00:40:22,469 --> 00:40:24,515
What the devil is that?
- Oh, uh, this.

410
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:27,039
That's Iddie
and Biddie, buddy.

411
00:40:35,787 --> 00:40:37,441
That's very clever.

412
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:59,593
Dr. Mosby. Dr. Mosby?

413
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,508
Yeah, right in here.

414
00:41:03,815 --> 00:41:06,078
Thanks. Look at this.
- Here you are, doctor.

415
00:41:06,165 --> 00:41:08,864
You sign for the sub should be
all civilian, we'll cast off.

416
00:41:08,951 --> 00:41:10,996
Aha.
- All civilian?

417
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:14,521
You mean the ladies out?
- Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am.

418
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:17,568
Thanks, Doug.
- We're the whole crew?

419
00:41:17,655 --> 00:41:19,875
Well, the Gemini capsule
only had two.

420
00:41:19,962 --> 00:41:22,660
Thank you, sir. I wish you
and your crew all the best.

421
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:23,791
Thank you.

422
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:25,532
Please try not
to scratch her up.

423
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,360
We'll do our best.

424
00:41:27,447 --> 00:41:29,797
As you already know, of course,
the program calls for us

425
00:41:29,885 --> 00:41:31,234
to put down 50 sensors.

426
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:33,801
Now...here is where
the first one goes.

427
00:41:33,889 --> 00:41:37,544
The east end of a Puerto Rico
trench. Got that?

428
00:41:37,631 --> 00:41:39,938
Looks like the first one's
gonna be the toughest.

429
00:41:40,025 --> 00:41:41,766
'I, uh, assume that
after signing on'

430
00:41:41,853 --> 00:41:44,073
'no on has had
any second thoughts.'

431
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,901
Okay, good.

432
00:41:45,988 --> 00:41:48,381
Well, I don't see any reason
why we shouldn't get underway.

433
00:41:48,468 --> 00:41:50,079
Man your stations.

434
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:51,907
I thought we were
a civilian boat.

435
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:57,956
Man your stations,
please.

436
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,138
Ten degrees.

437
00:42:19,064 --> 00:42:22,502
Doug, I'm adding negative ions
to our atmosphere.

438
00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:25,853
Make us feel a little better
first time down.

439
00:42:25,941 --> 00:42:29,466
Hmm. Take a whiff of this.
I feel better already.

440
00:42:53,011 --> 00:42:54,447
We're coming over
the trench.

441
00:43:01,933 --> 00:43:04,370
We made that in 500 feet.
1500 more to go.

442
00:43:07,504 --> 00:43:10,028
Keep it moving.
Look out.

443
00:43:10,115 --> 00:43:12,726
Here. Make the drop.
Sensor number one.

444
00:43:15,164 --> 00:43:16,948
Orin, come up
and take over the scope.

445
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:21,170
Easy.

446
00:43:32,094 --> 00:43:33,834
We're coming in over target.
Stand by.

447
00:43:39,144 --> 00:43:40,145
That's it.

448
00:43:46,325 --> 00:43:47,761
You all set?
- It's fine.

449
00:43:47,848 --> 00:43:48,849
Let's get outta here.

450
00:43:55,682 --> 00:43:59,556
Bring the pressure up inside
to...eight tons per square inch.

451
00:44:06,041 --> 00:44:07,651
We left an empty tank
in there.

452
00:44:27,758 --> 00:44:29,412
Sensor in position.

453
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:30,500
Roger.

454
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:32,850
This is it.

455
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:43,208
Sensor down.
Anchor it.

456
00:44:43,295 --> 00:44:44,949
Here goes.
Number one.

457
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:57,788
Here.

458
00:45:13,325 --> 00:45:15,458
Signal works great.
- Is it reaching Washington?

459
00:45:15,545 --> 00:45:17,547
I know my theory
and calculations are right

460
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:19,026
as far as
the ocean agrees.

461
00:45:19,114 --> 00:45:20,724
Craig, alert Washington.
- Roger.

462
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:25,642
Hello, Seismo Washington.
This is Hydronaut.

463
00:45:25,729 --> 00:45:27,818
Hello, Seismo Washington.
This is Hydronaut. Over.

464
00:45:49,144 --> 00:45:51,624
'Hello, Seismo? Hello, seismo.'

465
00:45:51,711 --> 00:45:54,061
'Overseas call coming in
from the Hydronaut.'

466
00:45:54,149 --> 00:45:56,325
Hydronaut calling.
It's the Hydronaut calling, sir.

467
00:45:58,327 --> 00:46:00,938
Hello, Hydronaut.
This is Seismo Washington. Over.

468
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:03,897
Standby for Dr. Standish,
over.

469
00:46:03,984 --> 00:46:06,378
Seismo, this is Hydronaut
from 30,000 feet

470
00:46:06,465 --> 00:46:08,075
in the Puerto Rico trench.

471
00:46:08,163 --> 00:46:11,862
No, I said 30,000. The chart
at this point is 5,000 feet off.

472
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:17,955
Our first sensor is planted.
Are you receiving it's signal?

473
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:21,001
The first sensor is down,
Dr. Boren.

474
00:46:21,088 --> 00:46:23,439
Doug, this is Gus Boren,
you alright?

475
00:46:23,526 --> 00:46:26,137
Hi, Gus. Ah, yeah, fine.
Everything routine. All well.

476
00:46:26,224 --> 00:46:27,921
Brink's gone to check
the reception now.

477
00:46:28,008 --> 00:46:30,620
Okay.
- What's happening?

478
00:46:30,707 --> 00:46:33,449
They're checking.

479
00:46:33,536 --> 00:46:36,191
Pressure, strain, gravity, clear
as bell from the next room.

480
00:46:36,278 --> 00:46:38,845
It's alive down there. They must
be right over the pole.

481
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:40,934
The reception
is as clear as a bell.

482
00:46:41,021 --> 00:46:43,502
Our signal is coming
through fine.

483
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:46,026
The message says you better
get out of there now.

484
00:46:46,113 --> 00:46:49,029
Okay. We'll get back on course.
Hydronaut signing off.

485
00:46:49,116 --> 00:46:51,031
Well, our first one
is down, uh.

486
00:46:51,118 --> 00:46:52,511
Let's get back
upstairs.

487
00:46:52,598 --> 00:46:54,861
Stations, everybody.
- Six miles straight up.

488
00:46:58,038 --> 00:46:59,649
Alright. Standby
to blow ballast.

489
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:52,484
Oh, the air.

490
00:47:52,571 --> 00:47:54,399
Isn't it wonderful?

491
00:47:54,486 --> 00:47:56,923
Now don't tell me
you don't like submarines.

492
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:59,665
Six miles down.

493
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:01,972
Yes, and that's only
the first one too.

494
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:05,845
How many more
are there?

495
00:48:05,932 --> 00:48:08,587
Forty nine.

496
00:48:08,674 --> 00:48:10,285
It's a bit confining
down there.

497
00:48:12,722 --> 00:48:15,028
'Maggie, don't worry.'

498
00:48:15,115 --> 00:48:17,030
'We're in good hands.'

499
00:48:17,117 --> 00:48:20,947
Orin, I'm glad you're here.
It makes things a lot easier.

500
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:28,607
According to maritime law,
Doug could perform a marriage.

501
00:48:28,694 --> 00:48:31,175
Oh, Orin, can you imagine
spending a honeymoon

502
00:48:31,262 --> 00:48:32,872
on a submarine
with four other men?

503
00:48:34,831 --> 00:48:37,050
Yes, well, I have to admit
it's far from ideal.

504
00:48:39,314 --> 00:48:40,402
Thanks anyway.

505
00:48:55,547 --> 00:48:57,723
What is this,
Big Brother is watching?

506
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,899
Well, it's better than
what you get on the television.

507
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:04,556
Clear the deck. Standby to dive,
on the double.

508
00:49:04,643 --> 00:49:07,124
Well, how do you do,
Captain Bligh?

509
00:49:13,391 --> 00:49:15,480
Dr. Hanford.

510
00:49:15,567 --> 00:49:19,571
I asked you not to wear perfume
aboard this submarine.

511
00:49:19,658 --> 00:49:21,312
I'm not wearing any.

512
00:50:59,149 --> 00:51:00,150
Maggie.

513
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:05,503
Yes.
- 'Bring me a cup of coffee.'

514
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:41,017
It's never the same.

515
00:51:41,104 --> 00:51:42,148
But always beautiful.

516
00:51:50,896 --> 00:51:55,292
Sometimes when I'm here alone
looking out there..

517
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:59,035
...I feel I'm in
a some kind of a dream.

518
00:51:59,122 --> 00:52:01,037
You always
were a dreamer.

519
00:52:01,124 --> 00:52:03,648
A dreamer
and a scientist.

520
00:52:03,735 --> 00:52:05,911
They don't quite go together.
do they?

521
00:52:37,639 --> 00:52:39,641
I still don't know
which part of me

522
00:52:39,728 --> 00:52:42,339
was attracted to you
in the beginning.

523
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:44,167
The dreamer.

524
00:52:44,254 --> 00:52:46,125
No, I think you're wrong.

525
00:52:46,212 --> 00:52:47,562
I think it was
the scientist.

526
00:52:54,525 --> 00:52:57,136
I remember the first time
I saw you, you looked so..

527
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,839
...efficient.

528
00:53:03,926 --> 00:53:07,886
Do you think maybe we could pick
it up again where we left off?

529
00:53:07,973 --> 00:53:09,845
You're dreaming again.

530
00:53:09,932 --> 00:53:13,196
You know as well as I do.
It's quite, quite finished.

531
00:53:13,283 --> 00:53:15,285
Really?

532
00:53:15,372 --> 00:53:17,156
Are you so certain?

533
00:53:46,316 --> 00:53:48,231
A mountain,
and you didn't see it?

534
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:50,712
That sonar must have been
going like a fire alarm.

535
00:53:50,799 --> 00:53:53,497
Only the two of you up here
while everybody's asleep.

536
00:53:53,584 --> 00:53:55,586
Just what're trying for?
- Are you her father?

537
00:53:55,673 --> 00:53:57,806
That's just...
- 'What're you, two boy scouts?'

538
00:53:57,893 --> 00:53:59,503
You're supposed
to be scientists.

539
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:01,157
When'll you start
acting like that?

540
00:54:01,244 --> 00:54:03,333
Stay outta this.
- Knock it off, knock it off.

541
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:08,817
Maggie, take a look at Hank.
He got tossed out of his bunker.

542
00:54:11,254 --> 00:54:13,256
Orin, give her a hand.

543
00:54:19,436 --> 00:54:22,482
You didn't start reversing until
you actually saw the cliff?

544
00:54:22,569 --> 00:54:24,223
What about the sonar?

545
00:54:25,834 --> 00:54:27,139
I was on visual.

546
00:54:27,226 --> 00:54:29,185
Why didn't you see
that rock sooner?

547
00:54:29,272 --> 00:54:31,840
Because I wasn't looking.
- What were you looking at?

548
00:54:31,927 --> 00:54:33,798
It's none of you business.

549
00:54:35,626 --> 00:54:38,020
Oh, it isn't, eh?

550
00:54:38,107 --> 00:54:40,587
Now, look. I'm aware
that I made a mistake.

551
00:54:40,675 --> 00:54:43,155
I'm aware that I've made a
complete, utter fool of myself.

552
00:54:43,242 --> 00:54:45,114
I'm sorry.

553
00:54:45,201 --> 00:54:47,420
Now, if you don't mind
we'll leave it at that.

554
00:54:51,468 --> 00:54:54,123
What do you think of having her
aboard now, huh?

555
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:56,386
I think you better start
simmering down, Craig boy.

556
00:54:56,473 --> 00:54:59,302
We want to get
this job finished.

557
00:54:59,389 --> 00:55:02,348
And our job is
to put down sensors, right?

558
00:55:02,435 --> 00:55:05,700
Yeah, that's-that's our job.
Put down sensors.

559
00:55:17,712 --> 00:55:19,714
Have got you the answer
to Hydronaut's question?

560
00:55:19,801 --> 00:55:21,890
I'm just sending
it out now.

561
00:55:28,723 --> 00:55:32,422
A-N-F-S-Q-7, answer my request.

562
00:55:32,509 --> 00:55:34,337
Top priority reply.

563
00:55:34,424 --> 00:55:36,861
Computer analysis as follows.

564
00:55:36,948 --> 00:55:38,602
Rook takes queen.

565
00:55:40,604 --> 00:55:42,040
Check.

566
00:55:46,828 --> 00:55:48,481
Rook takes queen?

567
00:55:54,792 --> 00:55:57,621
Rook takes
Black's queen.

568
00:55:57,708 --> 00:55:59,144
Oh, pretty cocky,
aren't we?

569
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,277
Playing a little over your head,
aren't you, buddy?

570
00:56:01,364 --> 00:56:03,409
Maybe,
don't you think

571
00:56:03,496 --> 00:56:05,542
a little incentive
might make us play better.

572
00:56:05,629 --> 00:56:08,066
Well, what sort of stakes
did you have in mind?

573
00:56:08,153 --> 00:56:09,328
Something friendly.

574
00:56:09,415 --> 00:56:11,417
If I lose,
I do something for you

575
00:56:11,504 --> 00:56:13,942
and if I win...then
you do me a favor.

576
00:56:14,029 --> 00:56:18,076
Favor? What for example?
- Oh, I don't know.

577
00:56:18,163 --> 00:56:20,122
Let's wait and see
how the game goes.

578
00:56:27,651 --> 00:56:30,828
Say, Doug, I've been
wondering for a long time..

579
00:56:30,915 --> 00:56:33,831
...how you got Phil to come in
this voyage with us.

580
00:56:33,918 --> 00:56:37,008
I know how you got me, that was
a fair shuffle, but Phil..

581
00:56:37,095 --> 00:56:39,054
I gotta be telling you
about this, something

582
00:56:39,141 --> 00:56:40,707
that he needs
your okay for.

583
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:44,233
Something he needs
my okay..

584
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:50,543
Yes, yes, now I seem to remember
on that first dive, him saying

585
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:54,069
"If I don't make your dive,
you won't make mine".

586
00:56:54,156 --> 00:56:56,419
What dive?
- He'll talk to you about it.

587
00:56:56,506 --> 00:56:58,508
Yeah, so that's how
you hooked him, huh?

588
00:56:58,595 --> 00:57:00,466
You promised him one dive,
for what?

589
00:57:00,553 --> 00:57:02,860
I'd rather he told...
- I'm asking you.

590
00:57:02,947 --> 00:57:05,297
I'm on this ride
for Dr. Hamaru, not for him.

591
00:57:05,384 --> 00:57:07,125
At least listen to him.

592
00:57:07,212 --> 00:57:09,519
Anything that he's in on,
I'm on the outside of.

593
00:57:09,606 --> 00:57:12,348
Now look, you hooked me once,
you're not gonna hook me twice.

594
00:57:12,435 --> 00:57:16,831
What's the deal?
- I needed him and I needed you.

595
00:57:16,918 --> 00:57:18,528
That's the only way I could
get you both to come along.

596
00:57:18,615 --> 00:57:22,053
'You didn't have your mind?'
- 'No, I didn't.'

597
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,186
'You don't have to do
what he's asking you to do.'

598
00:57:24,273 --> 00:57:26,231
'You're dynamite right,
I don't.'

599
00:57:28,755 --> 00:57:29,974
Position?

600
00:57:36,851 --> 00:57:40,202
Doug, we're approaching Ceylon.
We're 50 miles off the target.

601
00:57:40,289 --> 00:57:45,207
And we're getting
some shock waves.

602
00:57:45,294 --> 00:57:47,426
Okay, Craig. We're
approaching the Fumaroles.

603
00:57:47,513 --> 00:57:49,124
Better get ready, Hank.

604
00:57:54,869 --> 00:57:57,088
Standby for sensor drop.
- Oh, roger.

605
00:57:59,656 --> 00:58:03,094
I want you to know, that if
Doug hadn't already promised

606
00:58:03,181 --> 00:58:05,575
I wouldn't go
on this dive of yours.

607
00:58:05,662 --> 00:58:08,404
I know that. If I needed
to ask you for your consent

608
00:58:08,491 --> 00:58:10,101
I wouldn't have come.

609
00:58:19,415 --> 00:58:22,026
Everybody, into
the control room.

610
00:58:27,858 --> 00:58:28,903
Fumaroles.

611
00:58:30,687 --> 00:58:32,732
Alright, standby
for exterior heat readings.

612
00:58:34,604 --> 00:58:35,997
120 degrees.

613
00:58:44,744 --> 00:58:45,876
130.

614
00:58:50,837 --> 00:58:51,926
140 degrees.

615
00:58:52,883 --> 00:58:55,581
165 degrees.

616
00:58:55,668 --> 00:58:58,106
Orin, what's the temperature
in the center of the fumaroles?

617
00:58:58,193 --> 00:59:00,935
Anywhere from 290 degrees to 320
degrees, boiling under pressure.

618
00:59:01,022 --> 00:59:04,112
We go in there, we're gonna
be in one big pressure cooker.

619
00:59:04,199 --> 00:59:06,418
Okay, boss,
how do you figure it?

620
00:59:09,682 --> 00:59:11,771
It's gonna be hot,
alright.

621
00:59:11,858 --> 00:59:15,036
'We'll have to get those sensor
in as close as possible.'

622
00:59:15,123 --> 00:59:18,474
'Have to do it by hand.
We'll have to swim it in.'

623
00:59:18,561 --> 00:59:22,173
What do you say, Orin?
- Yeah, there's no other way.

624
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,436
I know it's my job
to pick the spot.

625
00:59:24,523 --> 00:59:26,134
I'll come with you.

626
00:59:29,528 --> 00:59:31,269
Okay, let's break out
the hot suits.

627
00:59:34,925 --> 00:59:36,796
Take over, Craig.
- Yeah.

628
00:59:36,883 --> 00:59:38,233
How about
the breathing gas?

629
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,278
You told me to
get it ready, didn't you?

630
00:59:40,365 --> 00:59:41,888
Maggie.

631
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:53,900
Alright, I'm settling
down in the bottom.

632
01:00:10,961 --> 01:00:13,616
This will help boost your
resistance to the heat.

633
01:00:13,703 --> 01:00:16,053
'When it gets hot there,
this gas is gonna taste sweet.'

634
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,924
'But just keep
breathing normally.'

635
01:00:18,012 --> 01:00:19,491
Mag will be reading you.

636
01:00:19,578 --> 01:00:21,972
Keep talking. I'll know how
your are by your voices.

637
01:00:22,059 --> 01:00:24,453
Alright, let's put them
under pressure.

638
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,194
You okay, boy?
- Alright.

639
01:00:26,281 --> 01:00:27,543
Come on.

640
01:00:50,174 --> 01:00:52,568
Maggie, get up to control room.
Monitor them on the viewer.

641
01:01:02,404 --> 01:01:04,754
Stay with me.

642
01:01:08,975 --> 01:01:10,803
Are they out?
- Yes.

643
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:12,370
Put them on the TV.

644
01:01:14,416 --> 01:01:15,721
Put them on
the loudspeaker.

645
01:01:23,294 --> 01:01:24,948
Phil, Orin?

646
01:01:25,035 --> 01:01:26,384
Can you hear me?
Acknowledge.

647
01:01:26,471 --> 01:01:29,039
'Orin here, receiving you.'

648
01:01:29,126 --> 01:01:31,868
Phil?
- Receive you, loud and clear.

649
01:01:34,697 --> 01:01:37,961
I want to hear Peter Piper.
Orin, you first.

650
01:01:38,048 --> 01:01:40,442
'Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers.'

651
01:01:40,529 --> 01:01:42,531
Phil.

652
01:01:42,618 --> 01:01:46,274
'A peck of pickled peppers
did Peter Piper picked.'

653
01:01:46,361 --> 01:01:49,625
'If Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.'

654
01:01:49,712 --> 01:01:51,975
'Where's the peck of pickled
peppers Peter Piper picked?'

655
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:06,729
Alright, Maggie?

656
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:29,926
Phil, give me
a heat reading.

657
01:02:30,013 --> 01:02:34,322
A 175 degrees.
Inside, it's a comfortable 80.

658
01:02:34,409 --> 01:02:36,759
Come on, keep repeating
Peter Piper.

659
01:02:36,846 --> 01:02:39,501
'Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers.'

660
01:02:39,588 --> 01:02:41,807
'A peck of pickled peppers
Peter Piper picked.'

661
01:02:45,811 --> 01:02:47,987
'...peppers Peter,
Peter Piper picked.'

662
01:02:48,074 --> 01:02:50,033
'Peter Piper..'

663
01:02:53,776 --> 01:02:55,038
Orin!

664
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:57,519
Orin, can you hear me?
He's in trouble.

665
01:02:57,606 --> 01:03:00,174
Phil, Orin's in trouble.
Get to him quick.

666
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:05,179
Phil, do you read me? Over.

667
01:03:09,705 --> 01:03:11,228
Phil! Answer me.
Answer me, Phil.

668
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,756
Keep trying to contact.
- Phil, come in, Phil.

669
01:03:20,585 --> 01:03:21,934
Phil! Phil, do you read me?

670
01:03:29,638 --> 01:03:30,900
Phil's going for him.

671
01:03:51,399 --> 01:03:54,140
Don't risk it. It's too hot
out there for this suit.

672
01:03:54,228 --> 01:03:56,186
Orin's already picked
the spot for the sensor.

673
01:03:56,273 --> 01:03:58,580
I'll just get in there
and get out fast.

674
01:03:58,667 --> 01:04:01,235
Now, come on. Get out of here.
Put me under pressure.

675
01:04:23,822 --> 01:04:26,347
Standby to pick up
Phil and Orin.

676
01:04:26,434 --> 01:04:28,087
Come on, Maggie.
- Craig, look. Doug's gone out.

677
01:04:33,658 --> 01:04:36,008
Doug! Doug!
- Gimme that. Doug! Doug!

678
01:04:39,534 --> 01:04:40,883
Wait a minute. He doesn't
have a radio on.

679
01:05:28,931 --> 01:05:32,282
Get him up!
- Hold it! Hold it!

680
01:05:32,369 --> 01:05:33,805
Come on, get him out.

681
01:05:33,892 --> 01:05:34,893
Watch the arm.

682
01:05:53,738 --> 01:05:58,134
Maggie, come and take
a look at Orin.

683
01:05:58,221 --> 01:06:01,137
Phil, what happened down there?
Didn't you hear me calling you?

684
01:06:01,224 --> 01:06:02,704
Hell, no.
I didn't hear anything.

685
01:06:02,791 --> 01:06:05,228
I just turn around
and saw him.

686
01:06:05,315 --> 01:06:08,971
Must have been a die out failure
or something with the heat.

687
01:06:09,058 --> 01:06:10,625
Yeah, the heat.

688
01:06:13,454 --> 01:06:16,152
I hope there's no failure
when I anchor the sensor.

689
01:06:19,938 --> 01:06:21,940
How's Orin?
- He's alright, I think.

690
01:06:22,027 --> 01:06:24,247
Alright, standby
to take Doug aboard.

691
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:41,656
Oh, I've never been
so hot in my life.

692
01:06:43,484 --> 01:06:45,703
Ah, pretty hot.

693
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:49,359
Alright. How's Orin?
- He's okay.

694
01:06:52,754 --> 01:06:54,408
What happened to you
down there, Phil?

695
01:06:54,495 --> 01:06:56,801
He says he didn't
hear us.

696
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:58,673
I didn't hear you.

697
01:07:01,545 --> 01:07:04,026
Is Doug aboard yet?
- Yes.

698
01:07:04,113 --> 01:07:06,376
Alright, I'm anchoring
the sensor.

699
01:07:37,973 --> 01:07:39,931
You can reduce
the danger of the bends.

700
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:42,194
Oh, boy, you're just a dumb,
old hard-hat, alright.

701
01:07:42,281 --> 01:07:44,458
Just like Doug says you are.

702
01:07:48,026 --> 01:07:51,900
Now, If I could find me
a mermaid built just like that.

703
01:08:03,912 --> 01:08:05,566
For once that guy and I agree

704
01:08:05,653 --> 01:08:07,611
on what would make
a really tasty dish.

705
01:08:08,699 --> 01:08:11,485
'Hello.'
- Hello.

706
01:08:11,572 --> 01:08:13,922
A swim in the middle
of the Bay of Bengal.

707
01:08:14,009 --> 01:08:15,880
Not every girl can
make that claim.

708
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:18,883
What happens if a big,
hungry shark comes along?

709
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:20,189
Shark?

710
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:23,279
Or wolf?

711
01:08:33,898 --> 01:08:35,770
Maggie.

712
01:08:35,857 --> 01:08:38,512
What'd you say to making a
salvage dive in the Hydronaut?

713
01:08:38,599 --> 01:08:41,515
Has Doug okayed it?
- Yes, but..

714
01:08:41,602 --> 01:08:43,952
I need everyone's consent.

715
01:08:44,039 --> 01:08:47,433
Yours and Hank's, and Orin's.

716
01:08:47,521 --> 01:08:49,348
Philip, Orin's very
grateful to you

717
01:08:49,435 --> 01:08:51,873
for going into the fumaroles
to help him.

718
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,092
And so am I.

719
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:56,965
Well, in that case, there's
something you can do for me.

720
01:08:59,184 --> 01:09:01,230
Well, then I'd say Orin
owes a speedy recovery

721
01:09:01,317 --> 01:09:04,233
to this particular mixture, huh?

722
01:09:06,931 --> 01:09:10,848
Well, looks like something
topless is going on topside.

723
01:09:13,851 --> 01:09:15,636
Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy.

724
01:09:15,723 --> 01:09:16,854
You'll blow a gasket.

725
01:09:18,334 --> 01:09:20,162
Share and share alike,
all of us.

726
01:09:20,249 --> 01:09:21,859
Then why should Hank object?

727
01:09:21,946 --> 01:09:24,949
Oh, he seems to hate everything
connected with civilization.

728
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:28,692
But don't worry, I'm working
on a special approach to Hank.

729
01:09:28,779 --> 01:09:33,436
Could you, uh, possibly,
sort of persuade Orin for me?

730
01:09:33,523 --> 01:09:35,133
I'll tell you what?

731
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:38,180
If you get Hank to agree,
I'll get Orin.

732
01:09:42,053 --> 01:09:44,578
Dr. Hanford,
can I see you, please?

733
01:09:49,452 --> 01:09:50,584
Close the hatch.

734
01:09:56,502 --> 01:09:57,982
Yes?

735
01:09:58,069 --> 01:10:00,898
Doctor, I don't know quite
how to tell you this.

736
01:10:00,985 --> 01:10:03,858
Except, turn it off.
- What are you talking about?

737
01:10:03,945 --> 01:10:06,600
Are you trying to tell me,
you don't know the affect

738
01:10:06,687 --> 01:10:08,776
you're having on
the men on this sub?

739
01:10:08,863 --> 01:10:12,823
I'm not trying to have an affect
on anybody, especially you.

740
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:14,651
'Why?'

741
01:10:14,738 --> 01:10:17,393
Because I haven't tried to drag
you behind the conning tower?

742
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,830
Maybe it's because I haven't
asked you to co-pilot me

743
01:10:19,917 --> 01:10:21,876
on a midnight watch.
Is that it?

744
01:10:21,963 --> 01:10:24,618
You wouldn't notice
whatever I did.

745
01:10:24,705 --> 01:10:28,447
I've noticed you
the first time I saw you.

746
01:10:28,534 --> 01:10:30,928
I noticed the way
your hair was fixed.

747
01:10:31,015 --> 01:10:33,496
I noticed your eyes..

748
01:10:33,583 --> 01:10:35,498
...and that perfume.

749
01:10:35,585 --> 01:10:37,892
I can still smell that.

750
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:40,590
But that was Washington
and we are on a submarine

751
01:10:40,677 --> 01:10:43,549
and as long as we are
on this submarine

752
01:10:43,637 --> 01:10:45,247
I've turned you off.

753
01:10:45,334 --> 01:10:49,338
To me, you are M.E. Hanford.

754
01:10:49,425 --> 01:10:51,470
Doctor of medicine,
and that's all.

755
01:10:53,037 --> 01:10:55,431
Which is all I've been
since I came aboard.

756
01:11:00,175 --> 01:11:02,699
Now, look..

757
01:11:02,786 --> 01:11:06,616
We've got, maybe one more
month in this submarine.

758
01:11:07,965 --> 01:11:10,228
And after that..

759
01:11:10,315 --> 01:11:14,537
...after we get our work done..

760
01:11:14,624 --> 01:11:17,496
...we have a whole lifetime.

761
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:20,586
A lifetime to find out..

762
01:11:20,674 --> 01:11:22,588
...what our feelings are
for each other.

763
01:11:41,042 --> 01:11:42,783
You men are
in beautiful shape.

764
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:44,698
Well, I might say
the same about you.

765
01:11:44,785 --> 01:11:46,395
Thank you, doctor.

766
01:11:46,482 --> 01:11:48,876
You, uh, you're pretty
rough on a man's blood pressure.

767
01:11:48,963 --> 01:11:51,574
If I weren't a happily
married man with few kids..

768
01:11:51,661 --> 01:11:54,751
I might be causing
a little trouble, too.

769
01:11:54,838 --> 01:11:57,232
Are you thinking about
what happen with Phil?

770
01:11:57,319 --> 01:12:00,626
Do you think it was my fault?
- Well, let's put it this way.

771
01:12:00,714 --> 01:12:03,325
If you weren't there,
it wouldn't have happened.

772
01:12:03,412 --> 01:12:06,371
Where shall I hide myself?

773
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:08,112
In your work, I guess.
- I do.

774
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:10,201
I know. You've been
doing a great job, but...

775
01:12:10,288 --> 01:12:11,420
I'm a problem.

776
01:12:11,507 --> 01:12:13,074
You men gave
us our freedom

777
01:12:13,161 --> 01:12:15,467
but sometimes it's difficult
to cope with.

778
01:12:15,554 --> 01:12:17,948
We'd better learn how to cope,
because you'll be there

779
01:12:18,035 --> 01:12:20,124
working right along beside us.

780
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:22,997
Whether it's in outer space
or deep under the ocean.

781
01:12:23,084 --> 01:12:24,520
You'll be there.

782
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:42,538
Check!

783
01:13:25,581 --> 01:13:27,235
Look at them,
thousands of them.

784
01:13:27,322 --> 01:13:29,977
Must be in some kind of a
special layer in the ocean.

785
01:13:38,681 --> 01:13:40,335
Where did they go?
- Don't look at me.

786
01:13:40,422 --> 01:13:43,164
I didn't do it.

787
01:13:43,251 --> 01:13:45,340
Hank got to be through
collecting his samples by now.

788
01:13:54,436 --> 01:13:58,005
Uh, sensor number 41.
Nine more to go.

789
01:13:58,092 --> 01:14:00,007
You two, plant this one, huh?

790
01:14:00,094 --> 01:14:01,269
Okay, Phil?

791
01:14:05,751 --> 01:14:07,275
Where's Maggie?
- In the lab.

792
01:14:07,362 --> 01:14:09,712
Let me tell you.
Just not an ocean out there.

793
01:14:09,799 --> 01:14:11,714
It's a veritable
minestrone.

794
01:14:11,801 --> 01:14:13,977
What?
- You've never seen such food.

795
01:14:14,064 --> 01:14:17,720
Enough to feed a billion fish.
Look at that!

796
01:14:17,807 --> 01:14:20,114
Yeah. But what is it?
- It's food. It's food.

797
01:14:20,201 --> 01:14:21,942
Hey, Maggie.

798
01:14:22,029 --> 01:14:23,682
Maggie, I got something...
- Wait! Wait! Wait!

799
01:14:23,769 --> 01:14:26,033
I know, I know. You gotta
close the hatch.

800
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,252
Come on, hurry it up,
will you?

801
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:30,385
Come on. Come on!

802
01:14:30,472 --> 01:14:31,995
Okay?
- Okay, yeah, go.

803
01:14:32,082 --> 01:14:34,084
Hey, Maggie!

804
01:14:34,171 --> 01:14:35,477
Look out, fellas.

805
01:14:37,261 --> 01:14:38,523
What's with him?

806
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:40,438
Ah, he found
some minestrone.

807
01:14:40,525 --> 01:14:41,831
Mine..

808
01:14:41,918 --> 01:14:43,485
Put us under pressure,
will you?

809
01:14:43,572 --> 01:14:44,747
Oh, yeah.

810
01:14:46,401 --> 01:14:47,619
Phil, hold this, will you?

811
01:14:47,706 --> 01:14:49,795
Maggie. Maggie, look.

812
01:14:49,883 --> 01:14:52,798
Look at this.
Look at that food.

813
01:14:52,886 --> 01:14:55,627
There's life in there so big,
you don't need a microscope.

814
01:14:55,714 --> 01:14:57,368
But check it out
anyway, will you?

815
01:14:57,455 --> 01:15:00,067
I gotta feed Doug.
Hey, Doug, Doug.

816
01:15:00,154 --> 01:15:01,503
'Hey, Doug.'

817
01:15:06,073 --> 01:15:09,424
Hey, Doug, Doug. I gotta
get out there again.

818
01:15:09,511 --> 01:15:12,166
Wanna get full set of samples.
- Hold it, Hank. Hold it.

819
01:15:12,253 --> 01:15:14,995
But the stuff out there
isn't even in the books.

820
01:15:15,082 --> 01:15:16,910
Okay, while they're
planting the sensor.

821
01:15:16,997 --> 01:15:18,650
That'll give you ten minutes.
- Ten minutes.

822
01:15:18,737 --> 01:15:19,782
Hank wait.
- Not now.

823
01:15:22,002 --> 01:15:25,005
Doug, have a look at this.

824
01:15:25,092 --> 01:15:26,920
What?

825
01:15:27,007 --> 01:15:28,225
There.

826
01:15:52,684 --> 01:15:54,382
Craig.
- Yeah, Doug.

827
01:15:54,469 --> 01:15:56,123
Tell Hank to wait.

828
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:57,689
Well, I can't. He's gone.

829
01:15:57,776 --> 01:15:59,604
Well, call him back.
- Well, I can't, Doug.

830
01:15:59,691 --> 01:16:02,042
He hasn't got a radio.

831
01:16:02,129 --> 01:16:04,174
Ah, never mind,
forget it.

832
01:16:04,261 --> 01:16:06,176
You're worried
about him, aren't you?

833
01:16:06,263 --> 01:16:10,354
Huh? Oh, uh, it was just
a silly thought I had, but..

834
01:16:10,441 --> 01:16:13,140
Hank said there's a lot of fish
there like a feeding ground.

835
01:16:13,227 --> 01:16:14,793
You gave me this article.

836
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,058
I read about, uh, little fish
being eaten by the big fish

837
01:16:18,145 --> 01:16:20,974
and the big fish being eaten
by the bigger fish.

838
01:16:37,903 --> 01:16:39,688
Position is good.
Move it over.

839
01:16:48,349 --> 01:16:50,699
Doug, I'm planting the sensor.
- Okay, Craig.

840
01:16:54,224 --> 01:16:55,138
Alright.

841
01:17:04,452 --> 01:17:06,758
Sensor down.
- Okay, boy, I'll anchor it.

842
01:17:48,626 --> 01:17:50,628
Sensor's coming through fine.

843
01:17:50,715 --> 01:17:52,587
Where's Hank?
Did you see him?

844
01:17:52,674 --> 01:17:54,763
No, he's got five
or six minutes, though.

845
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:56,939
Oh, boy, I wish
we had him inside.

846
01:17:57,026 --> 01:17:58,941
Philip, you got Hank
in your scope?

847
01:17:59,028 --> 01:18:02,553
Yes, but I'm getting
something else.

848
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,166
About 300 yards behind him,
moving along the bottom.

849
01:18:06,253 --> 01:18:08,124
Looks like another sub.
Or a whale?

850
01:18:08,211 --> 01:18:10,474
Whale?

851
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:12,911
Whales might dive this deep but
never travel along the bottom.

852
01:18:12,998 --> 01:18:14,478
I see something.

853
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:15,697
It's moving fast.

854
01:18:48,338 --> 01:18:49,948
I've lost him.

855
01:18:50,035 --> 01:18:51,646
He must be between
the ballast tank.

856
01:18:55,171 --> 01:18:56,390
Craig, Doug, look.

857
01:18:59,088 --> 01:19:01,656
Where's Hank?
- I can't see him anywhere.

858
01:19:01,743 --> 01:19:04,398
He must be under the sub.
- 'Well, I hope so.'

859
01:19:04,485 --> 01:19:06,530
Get in the airlock.
See if you can help.

860
01:19:11,753 --> 01:19:13,842
Hank come in yet?
- 'He hasn't.'

861
01:19:13,929 --> 01:19:16,105
Doug, you must do something.
- I don't know what. Phil.

862
01:19:16,192 --> 01:19:17,672
What can you do
electronically?

863
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,413
Oh, nothing, His capacity
is higher than ours.

864
01:19:28,683 --> 01:19:30,685
There he is.

865
01:19:30,772 --> 01:19:32,556
I get the..
- Hey!

866
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:33,818
Come on..
- Easy, easy.

867
01:19:37,822 --> 01:19:39,041
'Hank.'

868
01:19:40,782 --> 01:19:41,696
Hank, you alright?
- Yeah.

869
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:46,222
It's caught in the tow.

870
01:19:49,965 --> 01:19:51,227
Bring out a sensor.

871
01:19:51,314 --> 01:19:53,055
A sensor?
- Bring out a sensor.

872
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:00,976
Done?
- Yeah.

873
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:06,286
Alright, send it down easy.

874
01:20:08,026 --> 01:20:09,289
Lower, lower.

875
01:20:24,304 --> 01:20:25,740
Doug.
- Yes, Craig.

876
01:20:25,827 --> 01:20:27,394
Hank's aboard.
Anchor the sensor.

877
01:20:27,481 --> 01:20:29,222
What?
- Anchor the sensor.

878
01:20:29,309 --> 01:20:31,441
What are you talking about?
- Blow it! Just blow it.

879
01:20:31,528 --> 01:20:32,573
Okay, got you.

880
01:20:50,591 --> 01:20:52,767
Hydronaut calling
Seismo, Washington.

881
01:20:52,854 --> 01:20:54,290
Seismo.

882
01:21:05,823 --> 01:21:08,652
Roger, Hydronaut.
Understand, signing off.

883
01:21:11,481 --> 01:21:14,397
They're approaching the location
for the last sensor.

884
01:21:14,484 --> 01:21:17,008
Send for the American.

885
01:21:17,095 --> 01:21:20,577
Reports an earthquake
of 6.5 on the Richter scale.

886
01:21:20,664 --> 01:21:22,927
You'll get a warning
system in time.

887
01:21:23,014 --> 01:21:25,408
Even after they
put the last one down.

888
01:21:25,495 --> 01:21:28,672
Will the system interlock?
- Well, we'll know soon enough.

889
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:30,413
Standby on your regional map.

890
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:35,592
The last one.

891
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:38,203
Let's give her our
blessing and let it go.

892
01:21:38,291 --> 01:21:41,816
Hank, standby to inform Seismo
as soon as it's anchored.

893
01:21:41,903 --> 01:21:44,122
And if the whole
system works then..

894
01:21:44,209 --> 01:21:46,168
...my dive.

895
01:21:46,255 --> 01:21:47,778
Alright, here she goes.

896
01:21:53,567 --> 01:21:54,829
Anchor it.

897
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:09,583
Dr. Boren, Dr. Hamaru.

898
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:11,672
The last sensor's down
and the signal's perfect.

899
01:22:11,759 --> 01:22:13,021
Get me the Hydronaut.

900
01:22:16,677 --> 01:22:17,982
Are all the sub
system's working?

901
01:22:18,069 --> 01:22:20,028
Signal okay. Roger.

902
01:22:20,115 --> 01:22:21,508
Coming through.
- Fine here.

903
01:22:21,595 --> 01:22:22,770
Okay, check.

904
01:22:24,032 --> 01:22:25,729
Alright, standby
for an interlock.

905
01:22:27,905 --> 01:22:30,647
Well, doctor, this was
your conception.

906
01:22:30,734 --> 01:22:32,562
Or misconception.

907
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:38,351
It's interlocked.
It's okay.

908
01:22:39,526 --> 01:22:41,005
Call the Hydronaut.

909
01:22:41,092 --> 01:22:42,659
'Hello, Hydronaut.'

910
01:22:42,746 --> 01:22:45,183
'I think if it's closed,
and it works perfectly.'

911
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:47,664
'The system works.
It really, really works.'

912
01:22:47,751 --> 01:22:49,318
We did it!
We did it!

913
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,453
Great, great.

914
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:56,456
Hey, gang, guaranteed not
to be over 10 minutes old.

915
01:22:56,543 --> 01:22:59,546
It'll have you gone in 90
seconds without a hangover.

916
01:22:59,633 --> 01:23:02,026
Hey, who is minding the store?
Get back it.

917
01:23:02,113 --> 01:23:04,377
Sure, but gimme time
to try one on.

918
01:24:05,786 --> 01:24:07,352
You know, we never did really

919
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:10,399
settle on just what
we're playing for.

920
01:24:10,486 --> 01:24:12,967
Anything you say.

921
01:24:13,054 --> 01:24:15,404
Anything?

922
01:24:15,491 --> 01:24:18,189
You don't want to take
a look at that last move?

923
01:24:18,276 --> 01:24:21,018
No, no, no.
You go ahead and name it.

924
01:24:21,105 --> 01:24:23,456
Well, according to an agreement
I have with Douglas here

925
01:24:23,543 --> 01:24:26,371
I need your consent
for a salvage dive.

926
01:24:26,459 --> 01:24:28,983
And I also need
your breathing gas.

927
01:24:29,070 --> 01:24:32,552
If I win, you help me.

928
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:34,945
And if you lose, no dive.

929
01:24:43,214 --> 01:24:45,216
You're checkmate in two moves.

930
01:24:47,305 --> 01:24:48,959
No that's impossible.

931
01:24:51,614 --> 01:24:53,877
Why, because you couldn't
outfox me with that

932
01:24:53,964 --> 01:24:55,488
rat-thing
computer of yours?

933
01:24:58,708 --> 01:25:01,058
Didn't you think
it was wrong to use it?

934
01:25:01,145 --> 01:25:04,061
Wasn't it wrong to piggyback
your treasure dive on this sub?

935
01:25:04,148 --> 01:25:05,715
No.

936
01:25:05,802 --> 01:25:07,630
Then maybe you ought
to ask your computer

937
01:25:07,717 --> 01:25:09,023
whether it's right or wrong?

938
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:10,590
Maybe it'll know
the difference.

939
01:25:10,677 --> 01:25:12,330
Or maybe it'll get
a nervous breakdown

940
01:25:12,417 --> 01:25:13,941
in trying to figure it out.

941
01:25:17,248 --> 01:25:20,208
The computer I used
was conceived by me

942
01:25:20,295 --> 01:25:22,732
designed by me
and engineered by me.

943
01:25:22,819 --> 01:25:24,821
It's merely an electronic
extension of my own mind

944
01:25:24,908 --> 01:25:26,519
I've a perfect right to use.

945
01:25:26,606 --> 01:25:29,173
That makes no difference.
You lost.

946
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,784
No dive.

947
01:25:41,882 --> 01:25:43,579
Using the computer
to figure his moves.

948
01:25:47,061 --> 01:25:49,716
About three weeks ago,
on my night watch..

949
01:25:49,803 --> 01:25:52,196
...I found a teletype
from Washington.

950
01:25:52,283 --> 01:25:54,503
He's getting his information
from some big stupid called

951
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:56,940
MX2NR2.

952
01:25:57,027 --> 01:25:58,725
Does it make any
difference to you

953
01:25:58,812 --> 01:26:00,857
that the big stupid
belongs to him?

954
01:26:02,903 --> 01:26:04,600
That he designed it?

955
01:26:04,687 --> 01:26:07,255
You don't really believe he
designed that thing, do you?

956
01:26:07,342 --> 01:26:09,518
I have seen it.
You think he designed it?

957
01:26:09,605 --> 01:26:11,564
From top to bottom.

958
01:26:13,696 --> 01:26:15,959
He-he really did?
- Yup.

959
01:26:19,354 --> 01:26:21,356
Takes a real brain
to build one of those.

960
01:26:23,053 --> 01:26:25,534
Real big brain.

961
01:26:25,621 --> 01:26:28,015
But he still felt
he had to cheat to beat me.

962
01:26:29,973 --> 01:26:32,933
Any guy with that much talent,
who wants something that bad

963
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:35,283
that he feels he has
to cheat to get it.

964
01:26:46,511 --> 01:26:48,731
Let the pirate
have his treasure.

965
01:27:09,317 --> 01:27:10,579
Nothing.

966
01:27:11,624 --> 01:27:13,103
Look at this.

967
01:27:19,457 --> 01:27:21,242
Nothing.

968
01:27:21,329 --> 01:27:22,983
'Oh, I'm sure you'll find it.'

969
01:27:28,815 --> 01:27:31,034
That, uh..

970
01:27:31,121 --> 01:27:32,514
Go back. Back, back, back.
Reverse, reverse.

971
01:27:35,256 --> 01:27:37,214
Phil, you were right.
- There. You're right.

972
01:27:37,301 --> 01:27:39,913
'The propeller.'
- 'That's nice.'

973
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,741
Well, what are you waiting for?

974
01:27:44,308 --> 01:27:45,919
I'll give you a hand, Phil.

975
01:28:49,547 --> 01:28:51,158
Good luck, boy

976
01:28:51,245 --> 01:28:53,987
When I come back, we're all
going to be very rich.

977
01:28:54,074 --> 01:28:56,554
If the stuff is still there.
- Yeah.

978
01:29:04,954 --> 01:29:05,955
Phil's going out.

979
01:29:57,572 --> 01:29:59,792
Dr. Boren.
Dr. Boren, Dr. Hamaru.

980
01:30:02,490 --> 01:30:04,492
What's happening?
- Must be a malfunction.

981
01:30:04,579 --> 01:30:06,929
'Dr. Boren, there's an
outside call for you.'

982
01:30:07,016 --> 01:30:09,453
Put him on the loudspeaker.

983
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:11,891
'This is Canal Zone,
Seismic station.'

984
01:30:11,978 --> 01:30:15,242
'We want to relay transmission
from Lufthansa aircraft'

985
01:30:15,329 --> 01:30:18,593
'approximately 250 miles,
south west of Canal Zone.'

986
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,334
This is Washington.
Go ahead, Lufthansa.

987
01:30:22,815 --> 01:30:24,512
Seems to be an island
in eruption

988
01:30:24,599 --> 01:30:27,210
or an island which
is coming out of the sea.

989
01:30:27,297 --> 01:30:28,864
Heavy formation
of steam clouds.

990
01:30:28,951 --> 01:30:30,387
Black material
thrown up continuously.

991
01:30:30,474 --> 01:30:31,867
Get the Hydronaut.

992
01:30:31,954 --> 01:30:33,608
'There's time for one pass.'

993
01:30:33,695 --> 01:30:37,220
'My position is 130 degrees,
12 minutes 18 seconds west.'

994
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:39,832
'11.15, 22 north.'

995
01:30:39,919 --> 01:30:42,312
Contact the air force.
Nearest base.

996
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:44,358
Request reconnaissance.
Televideo if available.

997
01:30:46,708 --> 01:30:47,752
Hydronaut here.

998
01:30:50,712 --> 01:30:53,106
Hydronaut, this is Dr. Boren.
- Oh, hello, Gus. What's up?

999
01:30:53,193 --> 01:30:55,717
Hi, Doug. There's an underwater
volcanic disturbance

1000
01:30:55,804 --> 01:30:57,588
a 100 miles due, south of you.

1001
01:30:57,675 --> 01:31:00,374
We need an additional
sensor dropped in there.

1002
01:31:00,461 --> 01:31:03,072
How close to the disturbance
you want us to drop it?

1003
01:31:03,159 --> 01:31:04,421
As close as possible.

1004
01:31:04,508 --> 01:31:07,120
We need it to fill
a gap in the grid.

1005
01:31:07,207 --> 01:31:09,339
The volcano is
103 west, 11 north.

1006
01:31:09,426 --> 01:31:13,213
103 west, 11 north, right?
- 'Right.'

1007
01:31:14,736 --> 01:31:16,477
Okay, Gus.
We'll do our best.

1008
01:31:20,481 --> 01:31:23,310
They're out there.
I was right. I saw them.

1009
01:31:23,397 --> 01:31:24,746
They're out there
by the cage.

1010
01:31:25,703 --> 01:31:27,662
Millions of them.

1011
01:31:27,749 --> 01:31:29,577
I know the market value
of those crystals.

1012
01:31:31,927 --> 01:31:34,234
Hank, Pill come in yet?
- He just came in.

1013
01:31:34,321 --> 01:31:36,627
Well, lock off the sea hatch.
We're leaving.

1014
01:31:36,714 --> 01:31:38,020
What do you mean
we're leaving?

1015
01:31:38,107 --> 01:31:39,892
What about the salvage?

1016
01:31:50,076 --> 01:31:51,425
Well, there it is, Doug.

1017
01:31:51,512 --> 01:31:54,123
No islands, deep water,
easy access all the way.

1018
01:31:54,210 --> 01:31:56,517
That's what I figured.
- Why?

1019
01:31:56,604 --> 01:31:58,214
Orders.

1020
01:31:58,301 --> 01:32:00,956
It's there. We just have
to pick up with our hands.

1021
01:32:01,043 --> 01:32:03,132
I'm sorry, Phil.
Washington said now.

1022
01:32:03,219 --> 01:32:05,874
We had a deal, when you planted
the last sensor we...

1023
01:32:05,961 --> 01:32:08,964
It's not the last one,
they want us to put one more.

1024
01:32:09,051 --> 01:32:10,748
We'll lose them.
So many of them.

1025
01:32:10,835 --> 01:32:13,142
We won't. No, I took
a fix on them.

1026
01:32:13,229 --> 01:32:15,318
It'll only take
a couple of hours.

1027
01:32:15,405 --> 01:32:17,668
Later, we'll get
to your crystals later.

1028
01:32:17,755 --> 01:32:19,975
Stations everybody.

1029
01:32:20,062 --> 01:32:21,498
Can't they wait?

1030
01:32:21,585 --> 01:32:23,674
No, it's an underwater volcano.

1031
01:32:28,549 --> 01:32:30,203
Dr. Boren, transmission
from the air force.

1032
01:32:30,290 --> 01:32:32,945
Reconnaissance
plane's coming through.

1033
01:32:33,032 --> 01:32:35,948
'This is air force,
Roger Niner-Two-Niner-Two.'

1034
01:32:36,035 --> 01:32:37,732
'I have your island on camera.'

1035
01:32:37,819 --> 01:32:40,604
'Are you receiving
our transmission? Over.'

1036
01:32:40,691 --> 01:32:43,694
Roger, Air Force Recon.
We have it. Over.

1037
01:32:43,781 --> 01:32:46,784
'My position, a quarter mile
due south of disturbance.'

1038
01:32:46,871 --> 01:32:49,265
'Altitude 1500 feet.'

1039
01:32:49,352 --> 01:32:52,138
'New eruption starting on edge
of older one.'

1040
01:32:52,225 --> 01:32:54,575
'Heavy fall out
of hot ashes.'

1041
01:32:54,662 --> 01:32:58,405
'Estimated height of vapor
clouds, 3500 feet.'

1042
01:32:58,492 --> 01:33:01,060
'Deep underwater,
faint red glow visible.'

1043
01:33:01,147 --> 01:33:03,192
'Estimated depth, 800 feet.'

1044
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:04,672
Get the Hydronaut.

1045
01:33:06,935 --> 01:33:08,893
We must have a sensor
in that area.

1046
01:33:08,981 --> 01:33:11,113
It's the only way we'll
make a reliable prediction

1047
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:12,593
on what coastlines
are threatened.

1048
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:14,421
Tell him to approach the area
with utmost caution.

1049
01:33:27,608 --> 01:33:30,219
And the time to get
that sensor in is now.

1050
01:33:33,266 --> 01:33:35,050
You were right.

1051
01:33:47,062 --> 01:33:50,631
Origin of the shock waves,
500 meters to port.

1052
01:33:50,718 --> 01:33:52,024
On the bottom of 800 feet.

1053
01:34:16,526 --> 01:34:18,137
It's like a hell itself.

1054
01:34:30,497 --> 01:34:32,107
Orin, what do you think?

1055
01:34:32,194 --> 01:34:34,240
If we got to the sensor
there in about

1056
01:34:34,327 --> 01:34:36,198
three-four hundred yards,
that'll be alright.

1057
01:34:36,285 --> 01:34:38,896
Three or four hundred yards?

1058
01:34:38,983 --> 01:34:40,072
See that shelf over there?

1059
01:34:53,172 --> 01:34:55,043
I'll take another look at it.
- Yeah.

1060
01:35:35,344 --> 01:35:37,259
I'll get the sensor
ready for the drop.

1061
01:35:46,094 --> 01:35:48,575
Here. Look through these.
They're filtered.

1062
01:35:52,187 --> 01:35:54,537
Doug, the sensor is ready.
- Okay, drop it.

1063
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:56,148
Alright, here we go.

1064
01:36:44,065 --> 01:36:45,501
Craig, Craig.

1065
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,591
Phil, Hank, come up forward.

1066
01:37:19,883 --> 01:37:21,363
We're buried.

1067
01:37:23,713 --> 01:37:26,063
Question is..

1068
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:27,543
How deep?

1069
01:37:32,287 --> 01:37:34,550
Craig, the airlock,
what shape is it in?

1070
01:37:34,637 --> 01:37:36,857
No good at all.
It's all stowed in.

1071
01:37:36,944 --> 01:37:39,903
The breathing gases and the
scuba gear is down there too.

1072
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:41,340
Orin.
- Yeah.

1073
01:37:41,427 --> 01:37:43,124
The eruption,
is it growing or dying?

1074
01:37:43,211 --> 01:37:44,343
It's growing.

1075
01:37:46,388 --> 01:37:49,261
Phil, if we do
reach the surface

1076
01:37:49,348 --> 01:37:51,306
we'll have to give them
a fix, can you do it?

1077
01:37:51,393 --> 01:37:54,614
I'll rig up something
to send out a signal.

1078
01:37:54,701 --> 01:37:57,007
How much air we got
left in here?

1079
01:37:57,094 --> 01:37:58,618
Six adults, one hour.

1080
01:37:58,705 --> 01:38:00,663
No, no, no.
We'll need two hours.

1081
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:04,319
If I can lower metabolic rate,
that might give us two hours.

1082
01:38:04,406 --> 01:38:05,799
Can you?
- I can try.

1083
01:38:05,886 --> 01:38:07,627
Alright.

1084
01:38:07,714 --> 01:38:10,369
Now, this is what we better do.
There's no other way.

1085
01:38:10,456 --> 01:38:13,415
I'll blow us out of this
rock pile up to the surface.

1086
01:38:13,502 --> 01:38:15,504
Doug, you're gonna
blow this up in half?

1087
01:38:15,591 --> 01:38:18,768
Can you think any other way?
- No. It's the only way.

1088
01:38:18,855 --> 01:38:20,640
Then get all the plastic
dynamite we've got

1089
01:38:20,727 --> 01:38:22,424
and put it into AFCOM.

1090
01:38:22,511 --> 01:38:24,121
Detonators, primer cords,
the works.

1091
01:38:24,208 --> 01:38:26,123
Others, gather all the
mattresses, pillows, blankets

1092
01:38:26,210 --> 01:38:28,474
anything soft you can find
and bring it here.

1093
01:38:28,561 --> 01:38:29,866
Hurry now, we gotta move fast.

1094
01:38:35,916 --> 01:38:37,570
We're buried from here down.

1095
01:38:37,657 --> 01:38:39,049
Let's not knock 'em.
Grab that axe.

1096
01:38:39,136 --> 01:38:40,355
Alright.

1097
01:38:40,442 --> 01:38:41,617
Go ahead.

1098
01:38:43,967 --> 01:38:46,274
Get rid of that
paddle first, huh?

1099
01:38:57,024 --> 01:38:58,939
Alright, give Craig a hand.

1100
01:38:59,026 --> 01:39:01,376
Get all that dynamite in here
as fast as you can.

1101
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:15,085
Get four of these
dynamite boxes.

1102
01:39:15,172 --> 01:39:16,217
Okay.

1103
01:39:20,308 --> 01:39:22,310
Alright, move ahead.

1104
01:39:22,397 --> 01:39:24,094
Let me see what
I can salvage here.

1105
01:39:56,692 --> 01:39:59,260
Airlock's underwater.
I salvaged this tank.

1106
01:39:59,347 --> 01:40:01,436
Good boy. This is
not a dynamite, is it?

1107
01:40:01,523 --> 01:40:03,351
No, there's more coming.
- Alright, hurry up.

1108
01:40:03,438 --> 01:40:04,613
'Alright.'

1109
01:40:22,370 --> 01:40:23,589
Work fast.

1110
01:40:31,771 --> 01:40:33,250
Shape it into corners.

1111
01:40:37,037 --> 01:40:38,473
It's gotta blow out.
Or else..

1112
01:40:54,446 --> 01:40:55,838
Maggie.

1113
01:40:58,754 --> 01:41:00,800
Which leads do I use?

1114
01:41:00,887 --> 01:41:03,150
Take a lead from
the main distributer panel.

1115
01:41:03,237 --> 01:41:04,847
We can ground
it anywhere in here.

1116
01:41:04,934 --> 01:41:05,979
Got it?
- Yeah.

1117
01:41:06,066 --> 01:41:07,807
Gimme the black one.

1118
01:41:11,506 --> 01:41:12,507
Okay.

1119
01:41:12,594 --> 01:41:14,422
It's no.

1120
01:41:14,509 --> 01:41:15,641
Got it?

1121
01:41:20,254 --> 01:41:22,256
The guinea pigs.
What about the guinea pig?

1122
01:41:22,343 --> 01:41:24,650
Guinea pigs?
Women and men first.

1123
01:41:24,737 --> 01:41:26,173
'Leave every cubic incubator
we've got.'

1124
01:41:29,089 --> 01:41:30,830
Alright, there's a spare
mattress down in the lab.

1125
01:41:38,577 --> 01:41:41,188
Leave it alone. It's gotta do.
Come on, get out here.

1126
01:41:41,275 --> 01:41:42,581
We got no time.

1127
01:41:45,148 --> 01:41:48,064
Phil, We are all set.
How about you?

1128
01:41:48,151 --> 01:41:49,936
You connected up?
- They are all connected.

1129
01:41:53,374 --> 01:41:54,767
Everybody here,
where's Hank?

1130
01:41:54,854 --> 01:41:56,159
Hank.

1131
01:41:56,246 --> 01:41:57,596
Hank!

1132
01:41:57,683 --> 01:42:00,163
Hank, get outta there.
- Yeah, I'm coming.

1133
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:01,991
Get back here, come on.
Come forward.

1134
01:42:02,078 --> 01:42:04,124
I'm coming.
- Come on up here.

1135
01:42:10,391 --> 01:42:12,393
Get up there.
Get in.

1136
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,612
Hurry. Hurry.

1137
01:42:22,751 --> 01:42:25,406
Mind the wires.
Avoid the explosion.

1138
01:42:25,493 --> 01:42:27,887
Mind the wires.
- I'll watch 'em, get up there.

1139
01:42:27,974 --> 01:42:29,192
Hurry up.
We haven't time.

1140
01:42:34,894 --> 01:42:36,548
Wrap this stuff around you, now.

1141
01:42:38,332 --> 01:42:39,725
Alright.

1142
01:42:39,812 --> 01:42:42,554
Brace yourselves.
Here goes.

1143
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:55,523
Anchor up.

1144
01:43:02,661 --> 01:43:04,314
We're not freed.

1145
01:43:11,887 --> 01:43:14,237
No, no, we are not moving.

1146
01:43:24,030 --> 01:43:26,685
Hung up on something.

1147
01:43:26,772 --> 01:43:29,122
If we had gone for those
crystals, we'd be rich

1148
01:43:29,209 --> 01:43:30,297
and alive.

1149
01:43:32,299 --> 01:43:34,040
I'm gonna go out there
and cut us lose.

1150
01:43:36,216 --> 01:43:38,522
Craig, cut us down.
- 'Give him a hand.'

1151
01:43:38,610 --> 01:43:40,002
Yeah.

1152
01:43:44,528 --> 01:43:46,792
Here.
- What are we doing this for?

1153
01:43:46,879 --> 01:43:49,055
We are gonna have
to equalize the pressure..

1154
01:43:49,142 --> 01:43:50,099
...gradually.

1155
01:43:53,668 --> 01:43:55,539
Hank.

1156
01:43:55,627 --> 01:43:56,932
You're first.

1157
01:43:58,542 --> 01:43:59,631
Hank.

1158
01:43:59,718 --> 01:44:00,980
Did you hear me?

1159
01:44:01,067 --> 01:44:02,068
Yeah.

1160
01:44:06,072 --> 01:44:07,943
Stand by, I'm gonna open it.

1161
01:44:42,195 --> 01:44:44,197
'They're not easy.'
- 'Let it out easy.'

1162
01:44:46,242 --> 01:44:49,419
Orin.
- Yeah, Dough.

1163
01:44:49,506 --> 01:44:51,465
Give me some flares.
- Okay.

1164
01:44:54,511 --> 01:44:56,165
'‘How many do you want?'
- Two.

1165
01:44:57,819 --> 01:44:59,255
Here you go.

1166
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:05,044
Alright, the pressure
is equalized.

1167
01:45:05,131 --> 01:45:06,785
That's as high
as it will go.

1168
01:45:06,872 --> 01:45:08,569
Should we open it up?
- Open it up.

1169
01:45:14,836 --> 01:45:17,534
Sorry, but I have to take
a little more than my share.

1170
01:45:49,828 --> 01:45:51,525
Alright.

1171
01:46:02,057 --> 01:46:05,757
You said we'd have
a whole lifetime.

1172
01:46:05,844 --> 01:46:07,759
There's not much of
a lifetime left.

1173
01:46:09,761 --> 01:46:11,719
We'll make it.

1174
01:46:12,459 --> 01:46:14,940
We'll make it.

1175
01:46:34,133 --> 01:46:36,048
There's a float.

1176
01:46:36,135 --> 01:46:38,441
Yeah, good.

1177
01:46:43,707 --> 01:46:45,274
Come on, hand me a mask.

1178
01:47:56,519 --> 01:47:58,478
I got Doug, gimme a hand.
- Yeah.

1179
01:47:58,565 --> 01:48:00,872
'I cut the cables.
We must be rising.'

1180
01:48:16,888 --> 01:48:19,847
Well, the time has come
to show and share the light.

1181
01:48:19,934 --> 01:48:22,676
So there's a crystal for you.

1182
01:48:22,763 --> 01:48:25,026
One for you.

1183
01:48:25,113 --> 01:48:26,462
One for you.
- Thank you.

1184
01:48:26,549 --> 01:48:29,552
One for you.

1185
01:48:29,639 --> 01:48:34,079
No, you don't get one. You blew
the bloody submarine in half.

1186
01:48:34,166 --> 01:48:36,908
Well, I'd rather be a poor alive
scientist than a rich dead one.

1187
01:49:02,542 --> 01:49:03,935
Hold on, we are turning over.
