1
00:00:01,858 --> 00:00:03,066
Florence, 1518

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,519
- This one?
- Yes.

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,037
- What are you doing here?
Can't you see?

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,559
Hiding?

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,039
I'm working.

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,709
He is working!
What a good fellow.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,554
Drawing naked men for the monks.

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,553
I'm going to teach you to respect your masters.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,517
I have no masters.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,555
No?

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,233
Then what are you doing in that workshop?

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,679
Working gold for them.

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,035
And they throw you out?
- I left them!

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,470
They were stealing money from my wages!

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,118
And what were you stealing?

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,557
You lying slug!

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,479
You are jealous of my hands,
God guide my hands to work gold!

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,432
You'll never work gold again!

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,472
Come on!

20
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,238
Well, come on... come on.

21
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,435
I kill you all, bastards!

22
00:01:57,489 --> 00:02:00,032
CELLINI
A VIOLENT LIFE

23
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,594
Who are you?

24
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,279
Porzia.

25
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,555
You are beautiful, Porzia...
Too beautiful to be out by yourself.

26
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,194
Come with me.

27
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,832
Who can resist an invitation like that?

28
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,196
But there is something you should know: I can't pay you.

29
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,239
Perhaps you can.
I believe you did this.

30
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,310
Where did you get it?
That is no business of yours.

31
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,794
You're Benvenuto Cellini, aren't you?

32
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,437
How do you know my name?

33
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,871
Who told you that I was in Rome?
Come with me and you'll find out.

34
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,148
Porzia.

35
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,879
Porzia.

36
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,833
This is a man.

37
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,334
And a very handsome man, too.

38
00:05:11,534 --> 00:05:13,999
Would you like to spend the
night with the great lady?

39
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,718
Shut up, whore.

40
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,836
You are Benvenuto Cellini?

41
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,559
Answer me.

42
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,156
This is your idea of a joke?

43
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,351
Did you draw this snake?

44
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,115
- I just told you.
I've never seen you before.

45
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,157
Huh?.. I understand.

46
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,393
No, you don't.

47
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,758
But no matter.

48
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,355
They tell me you're a goldsmith?

49
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,239
Perhaps.

50
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,352
What is it to you?

51
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,116
You think diamonds could be mounted better?

52
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,432
If I mount them, yes.

53
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,954
Show me how you do it.

54
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,188
You draw far too well for a goldsmith.

55
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,840
And you understand drawing far too well for a woman.

56
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,918
Why did you pretend not to know who I was?

57
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,037
Because I only know what my eyes tell me.

58
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,516
And what your eyes tell you now?

59
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,033
That you are vain and ambitious.

60
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,596
Why start with my virtues?

61
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,035
What else?

62
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,799
That you are poor.

63
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,990
Isn't that why I am here?

64
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,917
Isn't a poor goldsmith just what you need?

65
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,109
Take it and bring it back melted your way.

66
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,478
Are you sure you'll see these diamonds again?

67
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,554
No, but I'm sure I'll see you again...one way or another.

68
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,318
Get out of my way.

69
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,272
Hey you, someone wants to see you.

70
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,595
Who?

71
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,679
Porzia.

72
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,676
Why such a strange face, signor Cellini?

73
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,433
You look so you've never see me before.

74
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,392
What are these games?

75
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,071
Where exactly am I?

76
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,309
Porzia?

77
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,118
You are in the house of Sigismundo Chigi, the Pope's banker.

78
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,475
A banker?

79
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,199
You just met his wife Sulpizia.

80
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,554
That is you.

81
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,155
- No, Sulpizia is Sulpizia and I...
Porzia.

82
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,631
- You enjoy making fun of me, don't you?
Enormously.

83
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,432
What's the point of this farce?

84
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,918
It's about time we had a farce.

85
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,437
All the dramas in this palace, it's so gloomy.

86
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,910
Money, power, treachery, blood.

87
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,352
I can only play my own part in life.

88
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,637
Wouldn't you like to play a part with me?

89
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,515
I will bid you goodbye, my lady.

90
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,638
What a fool you are.

91
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,749
Perhaps.

92
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,831
It's just a game.

93
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,554
Doesn't it excite you?

94
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,235
Two women who are really one... or vice versa.

95
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,712
Didn't you know that all women have two souls?

96
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,679
I don't see the souls, just the bodies.

97
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,317
What does it matter to you whether is Porzia or Sulpizia?

98
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,630
Isn't the life only the shadow of a dream, and we are only shadows?

99
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,396
When you kiss a woman, it could be her or someone else..

100
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,988
... it depends on how you kiss her.

101
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,792
You don't love me enough yet.

102
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,751
I'm not taking anymore bets.

103
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,912
There will be two more.

104
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,997
I bet three ducats on that.

105
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,274
Have you got them?

106
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,954
I'll have them, soon I will be the richest man in town.

107
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,712
It's true, so they say.

108
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,429
- What do they say?
- That you find a rich woman.

109
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,109
Come on, run, unfortunate one!

110
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,236
I won, I won!

111
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,558
I won.

112
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,479
Thank you, my beauty.

113
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,676
...today with you...

114
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,552
It's your fault, I am ruined!

115
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,952
Leave him alone!

116
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,714
Who the devil are you?

117
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,030
Someone who doesn't like seeing a child being beaten.

118
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,998
This is my son, I beat him when I want.

119
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,869
- How much not to beat your son?
- Never again?

120
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,995
Never again.

121
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,519
Is it enough?

122
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,598
Who are you, sir?

123
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,028
Who am I?

124
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,512
Someone who wants everything
and then discover..

125
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,413
... it means nothing to him, like these three ducats.
Are you a dreamer?

126
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,518
A great artist,..

127
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,469
who can take a hand of earth like this...

128
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,919
... and turn it into a beautiful living thing for all eternity.

129
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,590
So, raise... Come on.

130
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,277
Raising... Gently, carefully.

131
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,515
- Want a rosary?
- No thanks.

132
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,990
Beautiful... How much is it?

133
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,151
Are you sure the lady will like it?

134
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,196
- Do you?
-Not a bit

135
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,032
it's just like a..

136
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,236
You have great talent.

137
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,914
What's the matter?

138
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,311
Don't you want to be paid?

139
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,629
I didn't work for money.

140
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,876
I worked for you.

141
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,391
Don't you know the proverb?

142
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,996
When the poor give to the rich, the devil laughs.

143
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,837
Well, let him laugh.

144
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,749
What is that you really want?

145
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,396
An introduction to the Pope.

146
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,550
I won't introduce you to the Pope,..

147
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,114
... but I will send him your jewels.

148
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,754
And what's more

149
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,199
I'll give you money to make your workshop worthy of you.

150
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,038
And in return, you will give me a fifth if the price

151
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,236
... of every piece you sell.

152
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,117
Only a fifth?

153
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,998
Why not half?

154
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,956
Yes, you're right, you will give me half.

155
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,996
I never divided anything with anyone.

156
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,958
You will with me.

157
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,871
And if I don't accept?

158
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,039
Why should I?

159
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,752
Because I know that gold jewels' bussiness.

160
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,154
And?

161
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,513
And your hands are good bussiness.

162
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,672
Teach me, I pray you.

163
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,593
- What would you know?
How to become a courtyard.

164
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,678
Can you swear, are you a gambler, do you mock your neighbour.?

165
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,633
Are you a heretic, a slanderer, a scandal monger?

166
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,438
Are you an agent and a patient?

167
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,958
- Wait, what is an agent and a patient?
- Well, husband and wife.

168
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,600
But women no longer frequent the court.

169
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,390
This is because is forbidden to take a wife.
One takes a husband.

170
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,559
Is he a new player or do my eyes deceive me?

171
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,320
No, Your Holliness, your eyes have not deceived you.

172
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,153
Do I know him?
- I say so.

173
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,471
How do you become a heretic?

174
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,394
When someone tells you that at court, goodness, discretion

175
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,308
love and integrity, try to say: "I don't believe it".

176
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,038
I don't believe it.

177
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,516
- What is your name, my son?
- Benvenuto Cellini...

178
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,192
I am a Florentine.

179
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,755
Cellini.. Cellini?

180
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,879
The son of Master Giovanni... engineer to the house of Medici.

181
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,218
He served Your Holliness well,
when you were cardinal in Florence.

182
00:22:06,556 --> 00:22:11,624
Haven't you a soul?
Of course I have, if I hadn't to be sladed.

183
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,596
My friend, seek for it your breast.

184
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,548
Here...
..it is.

185
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,793
What do you think, Benvenuto, whose soul are they talking about?

186
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,154
About mine.

187
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,589
But now it is no longer mine, it belongs to Your Holiness.

188
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,956
Your flattery is about as good as your play.

189
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,913
Why did you come here?

190
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,231
My father - may he rest in peace - told me to.

191
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,712
He came to me in a dream.

192
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,870
He was crying and said:..

193
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,430
... if you don't play for Pope,
you won't have my blessing.

194
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,149
What scoundrels are these Florentines,
even dead ones.

195
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,239
- How do you become an envious?
Hate other people's good fortune.

196
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,486
- How do you mock your neighbor? - Telling stories.

197
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:11,310
- How to spew poison? - telling the truth.

198
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,313
My father told me that I could serve
your holliness even better with my own art.

199
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,994
I am a goldsmith and sculptor.The best that is

200
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,273
Holy father, holy father, I know who this man is.

201
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,246
The Florentine authorities notifies his presence in Rome

202
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:28,432
to the Most reverend inquisitor.

203
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,636
Go on.

204
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,191
He had already been condamned for brawling, violence and lechery.

205
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,678
- It's true? - I was just a boy.

206
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,513
When he was brought before the Florentine court ...

207
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,750
... for the attempting murder of a young jeweler ...

208
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,435
- I had to defend my honor. -...and sentenced to death.

209
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,636
He must be send over to the Florentines
but they can hang him.

210
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,197
Look at this, fine example of people's splendor.

211
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:13,111
Why don't you make me a silver bowl where I can throw the bones.

212
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,749
Let me tell you how it should be.

213
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,072
A spout, you will make me a spout,
must be in the shape of a faun, you understand?

214
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,398
He will be suported but two naked nymphs with slightly bent legs.

215
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,109
Better, on second thoughts,
make them almost naked...almost.

216
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,512
Which is it to be today - are you Porzia, who came for love, ..

217
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,955
... or Sulpizia for money?

218
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,278
Who did you corrupt to go to the Pope?

219
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,476
A cardinal? .. A swiss guard?

220
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,439
A musician.

221
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,197
What did you pay him with?

222
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,754
A smile.

223
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,714
I am the one to get you work.

224
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,189
You'd be a fool to try on your own.

225
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,114
You'll never understand the way is Pope, cardinals and nobles.

226
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,270
You are an earthly creature ...

227
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,757
... they belong to heaven.

228
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,713
They think they do.

229
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:08,032
Our agreement was that I bought you, and only I will sell you.

230
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,670
Want some? ... Beans.

231
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,638
Who is the boy?

232
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,997
My apprentice ... Why?

233
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,394
Get rid of him.

234
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,428
If I knew what moves your heart, my lady , perhaps I'll do it ..

235
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,953
... but since I don't understand, the boy stays with me.

236
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,114
Paolino ... leave  me alone with the lady.

237
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,157
Are you in love with him?

238
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,673
What are you doing?

239
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,519
You are crazy.

240
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,628
No, but I will find out. - Porzia, Sulpizia? ..

241
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,951
- Game is over, understand?
No.

242
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,116
I'll have you murdered.

243
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,156
I swear, they'll find your body in the Tiber.

244
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,113
Benvenuto?

245
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,516
Benvenuto, where are you?

246
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,838
It's me, Porzia.

247
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,428
Porzia.

248
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,598
You are in danger, Benvenuto.

249
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,478
You must get away.

250
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,953
Look behind you.

251
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,149
Careful, you break my neck.

252
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,636
This is the left one, idiot.

253
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,031
What is this man doing here?

254
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,271
Your Holiness, you called me.

255
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,749
Did I? .. I dont remember.

256
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,639
Ah, yes.

257
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,599
I 've heard you've been behaved badly, licentious,
quarrelsome, arogant

258
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,358
I received a complaint from the Bishop of Salamanca.

259
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,477
He says you made him a silver vase ...

260
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,632
... and demanded payment on delivery.

261
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,628
- Is that true? - Absolutely true.

262
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,832
Good ... I'can't stand the bishop of Salamanca.

263
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,311
You may come closer.

264
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,754
What really happened with a certain lady?

265
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,558
Simply this.

266
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,790
I told her I was born a free man
and I wanted to live as a free man.

267
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,236
I wanted to belong to myself and not to others.

268
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,473
If anyone wanted me they should ask me.

269
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,312
Leave us alone.

270
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,952
My dear Benvenuto, do you think such words are appropriate in here?

271
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,316
I can't make up my mind whether I have to throw you out or ...

272
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,712
... or to envy you.

273
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,952
When they made me Pope, I also thought that I would be free.

274
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,793
But free to do what?

275
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,192
I seem to have everything, but there is one final temptation.

276
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,591
Do you know what the ultimate temptation is, Benvenuto ... for the Pope?

277
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,558
Sainthood.

278
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,398
I believe I shall be damned for wanting it.

279
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,602
But who knows, perhaps I served the Lord ..... exactly as I am.

280
00:32:41,802 --> 00:32:44,872
Or perhaps He has no better material to work with

281
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,479
I don't like the word "freedom" coming from a mouth of a  Florentine.

282
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,047
It reminds me of when my family when thrown out of Florence - ..

283
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:04,275
... sedition, desorder, republicanism.

284
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,952
And you ...you annoy me.

285
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,039
You want to make too much noise in the world,
you are greedy for something.

286
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,639
What is it?

287
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,360
- Your money, Holliness. - What did you say?

288
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,351
Let me show you.

289
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,351
Here is a coin made by your predecessor's careless engravers.

290
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,432
Does Is seem worthy of the great Pope?

291
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,755
Appoint me Master of engravers of the Mint

292
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,389
... and I will make you the most beautiful coins in the world.

293
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,276
With your face on them.And your name

294
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,350
You will endure for all eternity.

295
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,032
I wasn't quite what I had in mind- to be remembered because of a penny.

296
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,791
Not just a penny, Holliness, a penny made by Benvenuto Cellini.

297
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,675
The plague is send by God?

298
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,959
- Who told you that?
The barber.

299
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,590
-On account of our sins? - In account of your sins, master.

300
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,793
Don't open it.

301
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,713
- Open up, Benvenuto. - It's Rosso.

302
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,993
Open the door, you scoundrel ... I heard you.

303
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,640
- You are alone? - Of course I'm alone.

304
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,911
- Go, Paolino. Are you locking out the oldest friends?

305
00:34:31,355 --> 00:34:32,560
Come on, open up!

306
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,314
Rosso(Red).

307
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,753
- Benvenuto, ...you're broke.
You liar!

308
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,430
I brought Faustina with me.

309
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,349
Haven't you heard of Faustina? .. Half of Italy knows her.

310
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,159
The intimate friend of noblemen, cardinals...

311
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,676
Come on, you're exaggerating. - And the village priests too.

312
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,806
Look at her,

313
00:34:59,006 --> 00:35:02,231
She's like Michelangelo's "Sibyl" ..

314
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,632
who's falling from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.

315
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,234
Flesh, as only he knew how to paint it.

316
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,750
Actually, if you looked at her naked,
you would understand what I mean

317
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,749
She ... she bought this for me.

318
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,118
I was down begging outside churches

319
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,991
- Where are they from? - From Venice.

320
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,719
From Venice? .. Get out of here all of you.

321
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,712
- What's the matter with you?
There is a plague in Venice, they'll carry us.

322
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,475
On the contrary, looking at you I'd say you had it.

323
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,799
not to mention scabies, frenchpox(syphilis)

324
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,136
colics, otitis media ... and  diarrhea.

325
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,870
- Who's she? - She is my darling daughter ...

326
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,670
You wouldn't think so, would you?
She's so thin and ugly.

327
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,997
Pantasilea!

328
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,392
Has it this beggar shag has the place they call a convenience

329
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,553
... where a lady can relieve herself decently?

330
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,190
I'm dying for a piss.

331
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,394
Faustina, read my hand.

332
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,151
And how much will you give me?

333
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,310
I will paint your portrait dressed up like a princess.

334
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,473
No, ... do it naked, I prefere that.

335
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,518
... I always feel better that way.

336
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,630
Your master did this?

337
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,040
How is he like? - He is wonderful.

338
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,989
- Is that what he says? - He really is.

339
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,472
Men are all alike.

340
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,835
No, he is not like anyone.

341
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,237
The others beat you or they want what they want.

342
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,551
No, sometimes he does tell lies
but I've find out why he does.

343
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,552
Sometimes he invent things ... stories.

344
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,757
- And people believe them? - He believes them.

345
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,749
You will have a lot of money, but not now.

346
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,518
Not yet.

347
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,356
So much money.

348
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,678
But you have a long, long way.

349
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,759
That's enough.

350
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,639
What's the matter?

351
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,112
What else have you seen?

352
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,431
Faustina, I want to know.

353
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,113
Sickness.

354
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,628
Here.

355
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,155
He is already sick, he has a tapeworm inside.

356
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,956
Listen, Rosso, why don't you read Faustina's hand ..

357
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,669
so we can find out with who she's gonna sleep tonight.

358
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,354
What do we do now?

359
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,791
What would you like to do?

360
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,110
One guess.

361
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,517
Rosso is asleep.

362
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,913
You're the one I want.

363
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,114
I know.

364
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,396
But there is only one bed.

365
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,113
You live like a peasant, and spend like a lord.

366
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,276
This will double your pleasure.

367
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,830
It's not for me, it's for him.

368
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,837
Rosso is a great painter, but is shy.

369
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,876
I wouldn't say so.

370
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,110
He has no luck with women.

371
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,393
Go to bed, Faustina, but afterwards..

372
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,194
tell him you did it for love.

373
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,673
Are you just good or are you ...

374
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,318
Is it the boy?

375
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,995
Have you got to sleep down there?

376
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,078
I'm just good.

377
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:32,272
It's not very wise to leave your door open ...

378
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,828
... when the man with the scythe walks.

379
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,117
But I closed it myself.

380
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,394
Then the devil must have opened it
to take you with him to his golden kingdom of darkness.

381
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,471
Can't defy me.

382
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,596
I can save you.

383
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,871
I can save you.

384
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,194
Who are you?

385
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,195
I am the doctor of the damned.

386
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:29,158
Benvenuto, are you talking to yourself?

387
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,072
What's the matter with you?

388
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,199
He's gone!

389
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,472
- Rosso, have you seen him? See him?

390
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,673
He is raving.

391
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,238
It was the devil himself.

392
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,828
He's ill.

393
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,870
He is ill.

394
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,871
How do you know?

395
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,276
He was up there with you, wasn't he?

396
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,917
Well, well, well, my girl lost her virginity.

397
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,637
You slept with him, didn't you, you little slut!

398
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,871
No wonder he's raving.
Just look at him!

399
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,157
This man has the plague!

400
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,069
The plague?

401
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,472
Get away from me ... Don't touch, don't touch me!

402
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,470
Rosso...

403
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,597
- Don't.
Rosso, stay with me!

404
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,195
Don't touch him, come here at once!

405
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,032
No, I'm staying with him.

406
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,839
You think the plague spare little whores like you?

407
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,035
Come on.

408
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,753
Don't leave me, I'm afraid!

409
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,593
Go away, don't touch me.

410
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,714
What are you doing here, goldsmith?

411
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,709
I need your help.

412
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,873
You ask for help from someone who tried to kill you?

413
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,878
I am sick.

414
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,231
You're just dreaming.

415
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,752
I've got the plague.

416
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,550
We all got the plague.

417
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,633
Please.

418
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,631
Say: my love.

419
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:11,749
Say it.

420
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,756
Please, ...

421
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,751
... my love.

422
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,912
Yes, you finally found your Porzia again.

423
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,752
She was my sister, the other side of my soul.

424
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,835
If we'd been one you might have loved us both.

425
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,638
Now get out.

426
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,599
No..

427
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,956
let me stay with her.

428
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,075
I want to die with her.

429
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,993
Go and die among your own kind.

430
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,716
Master, master, master!

431
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,189
Paolino, where am I?

432
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,475
You are here in the workshop, with me!

433
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,032
Fetch a doctor...

434
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,558
... the one who was here last night - the devil.

435
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,869
The devil?

436
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,831
I send for the barber.

437
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,194
It's him.

438
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,912
Tell me, Master Cellini, have you slept with anyone recently?

439
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,959
Yes, yes.

440
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,673
When?

441
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,878
Last night.

442
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,069
That's bad.

443
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:14,711
Don't you know it could be fatal during the plague?

444
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,438
What kind of creature?

445
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,714
A young girl.

446
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,392
How young?

447
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,993
Just a child.

448
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,594
Then perhaps there is still hope.

449
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,240
He has to drink to be purified ..

450
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:34,199
... if we can manage to disolve the humours.

451
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,919
Fetch some water, boy.

452
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,388
He's drowning!

453
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,597
Better to drown than die of the plague.

454
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,909
Is this what you call a plague?

455
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,516
I dont know what to call it.

456
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,831
I don't understand the meaning of such wondrous event.

457
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,359
I do.

458
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,033
Since time doesn't produce the same circumstances

459
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,190
the fortune always remains the same.

460
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,072
It is now certain ..

461
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,470
... that the Emperor Charles wanted to start a war king of Naples.

462
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,516
descending for this purpose from the Alps.

463
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,269
It would be a sin to give such a beautiful coin in the hands of the venturous ..

464
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,034
... usurers, gamblers,.

465
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,350
At least they know their value, your Holiness.

466
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,790
As a result, Your Holiness may find himself crushed, ..

467
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,474
between the mortar and the pestle.

468
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,755
Does he think I'm a clove of garlic?

469
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,909
Who wrote this?

470
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,356
Your legate in Germany at the court of the Holy Emperor Charles.

471
00:52:00,426 --> 00:52:05,442
Tell him that His Holiness knows the designs of
providence without his assistance.

472
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,278
Not to mention those of the most cristian, I wonder, emperor.

473
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,759
You convinced me, you can have the mint.

474
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,752
Six silver scud a month, as wages.

475
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:27,112
Not including the cost of the material, naturally.

476
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:31,154
Clement, Clement, repent before it's too late.

477
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,355
Expiate your sins because your Rome is a New Babylon.

478
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,950
Is a nest of vices, corruption and death.

479
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:45,310
Everything will be destroyed by the flame
of the Antichrist, marching down from the Alps.

480
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,279
Listen.

481
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,793
Expiation

482
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,313
Anathema.

483
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:12,279
Forgive me, Holiness, I didn't know what I was saying.

484
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,878
Someone spoke for me ... Sorry.

485
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,588
Forgive me.

486
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,272
You may retire.

487
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,949
Recite a "Miserere"

488
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,599
And one for me too.

489
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,235
I should have him hung.

490
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,875
No, they are too many.

491
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,913
Rome is full of madmen preaching death ...

492
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,479
... it's all one hears

493
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:50,400
Are you? Are you afraid of death, Benvenuto?

494
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,918
When I was a boy, I saw a salamander in a fire.

495
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,951
She fought and twisted, but it didn't burn and didn't die.

496
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,798
It was an omen.My omen

497
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,598
I  shall never die.

498
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,396
More anguished you whores!

499
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,313
Use some feeling into it.

500
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:31,076
There is nothing to laugh about that, Faustina,
they just killed your son, for Goodnes sake

501
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,918
Show us some grief.

502
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,428
That's better.

503
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,833
Now try to weep.

504
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,270
And you three, up on the cross.

505
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:06,435
- The son of God is dead!- But we are still alive!

506
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,234
Benvenuto.

507
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,991
My God, who is this beautiful love treat?

508
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,987
She's called Pomona.
Why?

509
00:55:24,022 --> 00:55:25,287
Why?

510
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:31,193
Pomona, this is Rosso Fiorentino, a great painter,

511
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,157
and once a great friend of mine.

512
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,155
Once?

513
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,513
Before you ran off and left me to die.

514
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:45,279
But there is nothing wrong with you ..

515
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,636
... and you manage to land with this beautiful creature!

516
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,074
Come, Pomona.

517
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:03,720
I want you to meet Giulio Romano, ..

518
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,754
and Gianfrancesco Penni.
Wonderful painters.

519
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,311
Both of them.
Great friends of mine!

520
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:18,875
I wish you have died,
so I could have forget all about you.

521
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,959
You have changed.

522
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,199
How changed?
Into a whore, you mean?

523
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,079
Thanks to you.

524
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,748
- Where are you going? - To move my bowels.

525
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,035
Do I need permission?

526
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,232
Or hers?

527
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,518
I love this shade of yellow.
There is a lot of it.

528
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,879
And this carmine too.

529
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,673
Especially a wood

530
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,193
Gorgeous.

531
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,351
When I was in the convent...

532
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,589
You, liar..

533
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,468
The only place you were ever in was a whorehouse.

534
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,558
even before you had hair between your legs.

535
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:11,996
Come away.

536
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:16,358
- What about you, Pomona? - I was never in a convent.

537
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,071
- Three ducats. - No.

538
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,518
- Five. - No.

539
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,911
Up to now you've cost me nothing.

540
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:27,590
I said no,

541
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:29,798
I didn't say I wanted your money.

542
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,474
Have  you forgotten?

543
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,630
I'll beat you!

544
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,479
I'm marrying  a tinker

545
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,278
For God sake, why?

546
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:50,193
So I don't have to sleep in different bed every night
and end up with bastards like you.

547
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,112
So why are you crying?

548
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,555
Because I won't see you anymore

549
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,677
... and I won't be a saint in your paintings.

550
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,352
I loved that.

551
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,910
You are a bunch of Godless sinners, ..

552
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,712
... but you do lovely saints

553
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,313
Yes, saints.

554
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:11,515
Naked men, naked women,

555
00:58:11,715 --> 00:58:14,553
animals, billy goats, monsters, Gods!

556
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,516
This whore was so rich and her house was so fancy

557
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,519
then one day when the Spanish ambassador needed to spit, ..

558
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:29,265
...  he did it straight in the face of one of her servants
so as not to dirty the carpet.

559
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:33,396
See, grief is distorting their bodies.

560
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,997
What's the matter, aren't you feeling well?

561
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,435
No, not very.

562
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,474
Don't tell me you're pregnant.

563
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,595
Pregnant?

564
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,148
This always happens sooner or later.

565
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,717
- Let's see.
- No... no.

566
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,552
- Come on.
No, please.

567
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,278
Show Mother Faustina.

568
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,237
Look, it should be done like this.

569
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,675
- Well, show me. - No no.

570
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,793
No no no.

571
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,836
She is a man.

572
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,836
She is a man.

573
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,269
No.

574
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,636
Benvenuto told me it was just a joke.

575
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,191
Pomona is a man.

576
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,956
You have to decide who you prefere - boys or girls?

577
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,998
What a pity, I almost fell in love with her already.

578
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,675
Beauty.

579
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:53,595
Beauty isn't a natural condition, it's artificial.

580
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:58,391
Beauty has to be invented

581
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,868
... like your horses, Julio,
like my golden lilies, ..

582
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,878
Rosso's colors.

583
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,636
Glassmaker colors....and vulgars.
Figures as flat as pancakes

584
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,398
And you call yourself a Raphael's disciple?

585
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,471
Raphael is been dead only for 9 years.

586
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,516
You're right Penni, Raphael is dead.

587
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,256
I wonder what have you
done with his colors,

588
01:00:20,456 --> 01:00:23,230
his skies, his methods of depicting
light and shadow, his flesh tones?

589
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,828
We shit on them, isn't that right friends?

590
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:31,651
You're disgusting.
You dirt his name.

591
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,353
Whose? Raphael?

592
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,591
The one who smacked his lips on the Pope's ass?

593
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,269
Raphael.

594
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:42,595
Raphael.

595
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,434
Raphael.

596
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,113
Raphael.

597
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,671
You heard what he said, Benvenuto, he insulted Raphael.

598
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,557
Yes, but why are you so excited?

599
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,110
Rosso says nasty things about everyone, even about God.

600
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,918
Do you remember how the abbot of the monastery of the Holy Trinity ...

601
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,719
...comisioned your first painting?

602
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:49,157
He run out of Florence when he saw it.

603
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:54,111
Shouting that he had never seen so many devils in a place before.

604
01:01:55,080 --> 01:02:00,359
And you used to steal your mother's tin spoons
to make false coins.

605
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:10,356
Benvenuto, you saved my life this afternoon.

606
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,077
Yes, I did, although you don't deserve it.

607
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:24,238
Can you lend me a few thousands ducats?

608
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,833
A woman?

609
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,757
No, I'm leaving.

610
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,752
I'm frightened, Benvenuto.

611
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:35,371
The troops of the empire
are coming this way-

612
01:02:35,571 --> 01:02:37,470
Mercenaries-30 thousand of them.

613
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,318
They are heading for Naples.

614
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,188
Rome is a golden cow, they 'll rip her belly along the way.

615
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:51,199
This is not my calf, someone will do something

616
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,509
Hear that?

617
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,321
They toll for Giovanni delle Bande Nere....

618
01:02:56,521 --> 01:02:58,710
he was killed in Gadagnola a week ago., ..

619
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:03,715
... he was the last real soldier, ...
...which is coming to an end.

620
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:59,750
And I saw a woman sitting on a bright red beast ..

621
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,029
Having 7 heads and 10 horns.

622
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,873
She was covered in gold and precious stones and pearls

623
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,235
having a golden cup in her hand, ..

624
01:05:09,214 --> 01:05:13,029
full of abomination and filthiness and fornication.

625
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:18,589
And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints,
and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus

626
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,838
... and she was that great city, Rome!

627
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:25,650
All the men report to the gates!

628
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:27,353
Do you think that prayers will save you?

629
01:05:28,107 --> 01:05:32,595
And in one day should come to her the wrath of God,
they will all burn with fire.

630
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:33,715
To the gates!

631
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,598
And the whole city will be engulfed in flames, God will make his judgment.

632
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,234
Did you  hear me? .. To arms!

633
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,836
- Where is the river? - Over there.

634
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:48,989
Let's go back.

635
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,310
What? .. It was your idea.

636
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,073
I know,  but now I'm afraid. So am I.

637
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:56,755
-Well, then. Let's go back. - No.

638
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,193
We've seen enough.

639
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:00,589
No, that we're here we must behave like men.

640
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:03,148
I'm not a big man... a little man.

641
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,552
Little man.

642
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,314
Listen, Paolino, you go back home now.

643
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,960
- No, not alone. - Yes, alone.

644
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:21,954
Go back yo the house, shut yourself in , keep a close eye on things.

645
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,759
At a time like this, the city is full of robbers.

646
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:27,759
If I don't come back, it's all yours.

647
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,159
Do what I say!

648
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,588
Yes, master.

649
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,193
Holy Father, I've been looking for you everywhere.

650
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:16,956
You must come with me.

651
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:21,548
Let me die here.

652
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,756
Save yourself.

653
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:58,712
Help, pull me up.

654
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,639
The Pope!

655
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,034
The Pope!

656
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:35,509
You're facing a catastrophy, Your Holiness.

657
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,436
Camillo Orsini, who defended the Tarioni gate, has been overcome.

658
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:43,120
Captain Giulio de Ferrara was killed.

659
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:47,919
Rome is at the mercy of Germans, Spaniards, Bohemians  and Italians  as well

660
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,598
There are 30 thousand imperial soldiers in the city.

661
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:55,759
These are not soldiers, Holy father, just a bunch of thieves and murderers.

662
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,835
Fool!
You're responsible for all this.

663
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:02,443
The imperial generals asked him twice to negociate.

664
01:13:02,723 --> 01:13:05,515
All they requested, your Holliness, was money, provisions

665
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,875
and free passage to Naples ...

666
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,132
And twice he refused them...
I told him to.

667
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:14,549
If only the romans have forces.

668
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:15,988
They did.

669
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,788
More then a thousand died at the gates.

670
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,873
All is not lost.

671
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:25,078
Within three days the Duke of Urbino will be here with his Venetian troupes.

672
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:28,596
The duke will never arrive... and nor anyone else.

673
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,156
We can't wait any longer.

674
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,471
I have already send Marc Antonio Altieri to the imperial camp...

675
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:38,632
... with an offer of surrender to the Constable of Bourbon.

676
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,233
The constable of Bourbon is dead.

677
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,197
How would you know? - I killed him.

678
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,874
Let me pass, let me show the Pope..

679
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,555
... what a German Antichrist wants to do with his church.

680
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,631
Take care of your eyes, brothers.

681
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:53,996
This unhappy man was Cardinal Christopher Nomalo.

682
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,479
Was, brothers, was.

683
01:13:55,560 --> 01:14:00,270
The Lord gave up his altar and cursed his sanctuary ...

684
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:05,237
for the sins of his prophets and the inequity of his priests..

685
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:12,155
The Lord has thrown down and has no pity.

686
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,030
The Lutheran Antichrist came to Rome, ..

687
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:20,112
... to hang the Pope with a golden cord.

688
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:24,519
Forgive me, brothers ... This is my fault.

689
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,431
I'm alone to blame.

690
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:35,116
I thought in my heart that neither gold nor steel 
was needed to save us..

691
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,510
... only my sacred presence  .

692
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,352
I was the one who was blind.

693
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:45,751
I confess it before this poor suffering creature.

694
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:49,877
Mea culpa ... Mea culpa.

695
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,470
Mea massima culpa.

696
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:55,951
Mea culpa.

697
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,633
Come on, get it here.

698
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:05,669
Like this.

699
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,238
Reload.

700
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,359
Fire.

701
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,155
Get back cannon position.

702
01:15:21,013 --> 01:15:22,573
Why is no one here.

703
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,273
What are you doing here, you bastards?

704
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,193
I cut you to pieces!
No, my wife is down there.

705
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:31,192
Yes, being raped and disemboweled by those savages.

706
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:35,199
If I shoot you, then you will have hope to save your families from being killed ..

707
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,316
... and if you don't shoot, I'll kill you.

708
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,993
Give me that.

709
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,157
I hit it, hit it.

710
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,435
Go to the east side.

711
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,394
Where is the core.

712
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:36,671
Are you having a good time, Benvenuto?

713
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:40,594
Wonderful, much better than my art.

714
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:04,471
Come on, for the glory of God!

715
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,358
We are not afraid of you.

716
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:20,873
It's me, Holy Father, Benvenuto.

717
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,750
I want to confess.

718
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:43,157
The Venetians have abandoned us,
the troops are looting the palaces...

719
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:45,717
are killed.

720
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,958
Pier Luigi Fornese is filling his castle, ..

721
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:53,387
... the son of the cardinal is filling his castle

722
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:56,028
with treasures stolen from the churches of Rome.

723
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:58,069
And you?

724
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:00,153
Want to confess?

725
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,674
Yes, for all my kilings.

726
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,591
A lot of them, Benvenuto?

727
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,233
How many, tell me?

728
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:12,798
I can't say, Holy Father, but many...so many!

729
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,950
Did you hear that, most eminent Cardinals?

730
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,954
There is a man who is actually killing our enemies ..

731
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:26,670
... there is a man who is trying to save our beloved city.

732
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,754
Come forward, come and listen to him.

733
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,315
Well, Benvenuto, give us some details.

734
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:50,664
Yesterday ... I saw a Spanish prince down there, in the fields.

735
01:18:51,005 --> 01:18:53,074
having some trenches repaired.

736
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:55,955
Go on.

737
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,474
But far away, about three kilometers.

738
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:03,513
So I took my firing piece (shell) and loaded it with the finest gunpowder.

739
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:09,676
I calculated the trajectory and distance, and fired.

740
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:16,869
Out of vanity this prince carried a big sword,
and he was holding it in front of him like this.

741
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,913
My cannonball struck him directly ...

742
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:26,828
... and I swear to you, the sword himself cut him in half.

743
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:28,954
In half?

744
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,238
In half, Holy Father.

745
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,753
Amazing.

746
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:35,039
A terrible sight.

747
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,314
No no.

748
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:41,599
Yes, that's why I need to confess.

749
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,277
You already confessed.

750
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,317
Give me absolution.

751
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,316
"Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis"

752
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,718
For all the crimes ..

753
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,031
... which I did for the Roman Apostolic Church.

754
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:56,348
Ego te absolvo

755
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:00,669
And for the ones that I'll have yet to commit.

756
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,994
You always ask a great deal, don't you, Benvenuto?

757
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,515
"Ego te absolvo a peccatis tuis"

758
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:10,717
In the name of the Father the Son and the Holy spirit.

759
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,470
What are you doing here?

760
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:41,672
Conditions for the surrender of the castle known as Sant Angelo ...

761
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:47,398
 signed on June 5, 1527 from the birth of Christ ...

762
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,310
... by the imperial captains: ..

763
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,870
... Prince Filibert D'Orange, count of Foerberg, ..

764
01:21:54,320 --> 01:22:01,317
... Giovanni d' Urbino, Andrea Mendoz and myself - Gian Bartolomeo Dekinara.

765
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:06,555
His Holiness Clement VII entrust himself to the mercy ...

766
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:12,192
...of most Catholic Emperor Charles V pledging himself ...

767
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:17,631
... to conceal gold and valuables for the sum of 400,000 gold ducats.

768
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:23,792
In guarantee of which sum, which can be paid in three installments, ..

769
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,468
... the castles  ...and Ostia, ..

770
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:30,972
... Civitavecchia, Modena, Parma and Piacenza,
are to be handed over

771
01:22:31,172 --> 01:22:35,033
... together with the most eminent cardinals Salviati, ...

772
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,712
... Ridolfi ...

773
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,236
... and Ricasoli.

774
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,034
Why me?

775
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:13,240
I am not responsible for what His Holiness has done.

776
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,992
They will be imprisoned.

777
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:18,356
And in case of defaulted payment, put to death.

778
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:23,511
Pope Clement will remain a prisoner
in the castle until the payment is consigned.

779
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:27,354
He will be granted 10 bronze scudos a day.

780
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,430
Dear Master Cellini.

781
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:31,430
When did I became dear to you, master Cavalgino?

782
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:34,519
His Holiness wishes to ask you for a favor.

783
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:37,910
One that is highly secret and of a great importance to the church.

784
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:43,678
Benvenuto, I ask you to do for me, for the church, ..

785
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:49,671
... what no Pope had dared to ask for a thousand years.

786
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,154
I do not understand, Holiness.

787
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:55,834
Use your head, idiot.

788
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:00,279
How do you think we're going to pay the ransom of 400,000 ducats?

789
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:03,833
From St. Peter's gold.

790
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,476
Start with this cross.

791
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:10,839
Start what?

792
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:13,879
We want you to separate gold from the other metals.

793
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:17,873
Melt it down and recast it into 5 pound lingots.

794
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:19,916
- No. - You're the goldsmith.

795
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:22,353
But not a fool.

796
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:25,312
Why me?

797
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:28,196
Everything will be forgiven to you, Holiness.

798
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,516
But who knows the questions a poor devil like me will have to answer one day..

799
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,875
Why were you there, Benvenuto?

800
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,428
What profit did you make out from it?

801
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:41,715
It was sacrilege, Benvenuto.

802
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,594
I forgive you in advance.

803
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:53,516
In any case, the matter is already decided.

804
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:59,075
Master Cellini has agree to do this favour for the church.

805
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,549
Watch him day and night ..

806
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:04,677
... don't let him out of your sight for a moment.

807
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,316
Chalice with decoration, ..

808
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:51,274
... weight one quarter of a pound.

809
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,436
Primitive but beautiful.

810
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,078
I'm not an artist.

811
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,231
You don't have to be an artist, just a man.

812
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,710
I wonder where she came from.

813
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:22,037
Somewhere on the other side of the world.

814
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:28,070
Her gold may have come from stealing, usury, blood, ..

815
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:31,400
and yet she may be worth of miracles.

816
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:36,471
Pull out the eyes out before you melt it down.
