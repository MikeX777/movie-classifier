Production

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,710
That not-too-tall man with a round belly

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,238
is Napoleon Bonaparte,
the Emperor of the French.

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,235
He climbed up the hill to take a look
at his Grand Army.

11
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:11,040
With pride did he look at campsite bonfires
stretching as far as the horizon,

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,477
the long rows of tents and rifles
set like trestles,

13
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,720
the thousands of his soldiers,
horses and cannons,wagons and teams.

14
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,712
He could see his dignified marshals,

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,473
generals glistening with gold,

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,755
colonels and squadron leaders,

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,354
captains and lieutenants,

18
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,908
fifers with their long fifes

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,151
and drummers ready to play their marches.

20
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,956
The little Jean Francois was among them.

21
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,874
His uniform was faded, his boots cracked,

22
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,032
but Jean Francois didn't care,

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,877
as he had his admirable beautiful drum with him.

24
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,879
The Russian Tsar is too sure of himself.

25
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,879
What do you think?

26
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,871
Declare a war, Sire!

27
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,713
Silence! It's my task to give orders.

28
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,678
The war's been declared.

29
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,277
Forward, always forward!

30
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,708
Forward, always forward!

31
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,193
After breakfast, of course.

32
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,393
Don't you know which way is the way forward?

33
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,391
This is the one.

34
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,552
Go marching right ahead of your shadow
in the morning

35
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,599
and right behind it in the afternoon,
and you'll reach the target soon.

36
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,229
Now, I won't get lost for sure.

37
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,518
Forward, always forward!

38
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,433
Viva the Emperor!

39
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,149
Forward!

40
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,674
Get formed!

41
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,552
To the right wing!

42
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,437
To the left wing!

43
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,429
March on!

44
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,309
I'll be marching right ahead of my shadow.

45
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,432
The battle isn't going too well, Ithink.

46
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,956
Everyone's marching in a different direction.

47
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,473
Where are you going?

48
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,869
Forward, always forward!

49
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,837
That's right.

50
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,959
I'lljoin them with my Grand Army soon.

51
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,719
Watch those cannonballs!

52
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,757
Halt!Who are you?

53
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,038
Ah,we've captured a Frenchman.

54
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,308
I'm going to be marching straight forward,
obeying the Emperor's order, if you don't mind...

55
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,312
To Moscow,you mean?

56
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,075
Nay... If only I could decide it...

57
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,871
Ah,yeah...

58
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,228
I can see you've captured an officer.

59
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,517
But do we still have to be marching
forward, always forward?

60
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,036
Yeah, in a couple of minutes.

61
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,677
I've run out of medals
but will decorate you with this.

62
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,555
Whew... Anyone having a footstool?

63
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,757
You could put your feet on my drum,

64
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,719
but please don't you scratch it with your spurs.

65
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:43,392
You're right, such a nice drum
can't be destroyed.

66
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,714
This is Moscow burning.

67
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:10,959
The town's dwellers set fire on it so it
couldn't give shelter to the French army.

68
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:24,233
Put out the fire!

69
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,832
Yes Sir!

70
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,434
What to put it up with? We've got no buckets.

71
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,192
Indeed.

72
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,430
We can use our drums instead...

73
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,517
Why didn't you say it straight away?
Don't stand like that! Put the fire out!

74
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,716
I'll relax for a little while.

75
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,236
Where's everybody gone?

76
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,598
Where is the Emperor,the Grand Army?

77
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,318
Are you the only one to have stayed in Moscow?

78
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,988
Okay, let's go,the three of us: me first,
then my shadow and then,you.

79
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,591
I am Jean Francois,the Grand Army's drummer.

80
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,357
And who's that one there? Napoleon?

81
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,830
It's my friend the Billy Goat.

82
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,752
A nice one, indeed.

83
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,432
Are you theTsar?

84
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,756
Ha-ha! I am General Morozov.

85
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:07,473
I've lost my army in this snowstorm.
Didn't you see them, by any chance?

86
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,076
No, I'm going forward, always forward.
As I'm ordered to.

87
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,393
What I'm doing is retreating, always retreating.
It's the tactics.

88
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,270
Let's go together then.
Perhaps we'll find our armies.

89
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,551
Let's first have a bit to eat,will we?

90
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,918
Excellent!We'll make a snow soup.

91
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,310
You take a portion offresh clean snow.

92
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,550
What else?

93
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,231
Nothing,you can't spoilthe taste.

94
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,915
Isn't it delicious?

95
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,353
It is...

96
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,436
Don't say anything else,
I feel awkward when flattered.

97
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:20,193
There's the ocean.
Are you willing to go any further?

98
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,033
I've got to march forward, always forward.

99
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,912
And I had to retreat, always retreat,
that's why we marched together.

100
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,595
But now, I'm changing my direction.

101
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,592
Changing your tactics?

102
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,992
Where's my army at last?

103
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,588
Goodbye, General! Bye, Billy Goat!

104
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,831
Goodbye!

105
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,036
Jean Francois sailed fast forward.

106
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:13,235
When hewas hungry, hewould take Emperor
Napoleon's hairpin away and fished.

107
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,917
When he got bored, he'd sing combat songs.

108
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:27,555
One day, a wave dropped him on a sandy coast.

109
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,835
By my scalp - may I preserve it for ever!
The Cockeyed Deer is chasing us!

110
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,115
I'm Jean Francois.

111
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,351
Lully Bull, at your service.

112
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,960
I've got to be marching ahead of my shadow,
couldn't you possibly turn in that direction?

113
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,715
No I couldn't, but, by my scalp - may I
preserve it for ever!

114
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,839
You'll make up for your lost time,
I promise you.

115
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,637
Lully Bull and Jean Francois arrived
in a small town

116
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:54,719
where Professor Jim Crackey lived -
thescholar, inventor, and great weirdo.

117
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,118
Jean Francois, Emperor Napoleon's drummer.

118
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,679
Whassat?

119
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,309
This is Jean Francois,
and my name is Lully Bull.

120
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,469
Bull?

121
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,039
Lully Bull!

122
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,556
Ah, bull-loon... Oh,there it is!

123
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:27,275
A balloon!You should've said it straight away:
you needed a balloon!

124
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:47,113
By my scalp - may I preserve it for ever!
I'd prefer meeting a Cockeyed Deer instead!

125
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,031
A real balloon!

126
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,913
Forward, always forward!

127
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,639
Fare you well!

128
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,473
A hell of a boy, by my scalp!

129
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,510
May you preserve it for ever, Lully Bull! Bye!

130
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,633
Jean Francois flied away with his balloon,

131
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:32,193
a favorablewind pushing him fast forward.

132
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:49,116
Waterloo has been the most horrible battle
I've ever fought.

133
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,433
Especially,from the moment I lost it.

134
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:02,274
The enemy's chasing us!The enemy!

135
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,557
Yeah... Now they'll put allthe guilt on me.

136
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,752
Aren't you going in the wrong direction?

137
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,354
Forward I go, always forward.

138
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,228
In the morning, I lead my shadow;
afternoon, I follow it.

139
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,235
You've marched round the globe,
without setting the direction

140
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,995
with a saber or cannon fire.

141
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,196
What a great march...

142
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,669
Aren't you going with me, Emperor?

143
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,197
What's an emperor without an army?

144
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:14,676
You march on by yourself, and take care
about your admirable drum.

145
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:16,360
Forward, always forward!
