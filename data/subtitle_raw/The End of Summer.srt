So meticulous.
Let me see that.

33
00:02:57,396 --> 00:02:59,763
Hey, does my eye look strange today?

34
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,391
Looks the same to me.

35
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,822
Someone got you a nice gift.

36
00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:12,452
I bought it myself.

37
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:16,406
He's here.

38
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,017
- Welcome.
- Good evening.

39
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:25,192
You came alone?

40
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:28,227
She'll be here soon.
I told her to come at seven.

41
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:31,144
I'll have a whiskey on the rocks.

42
00:03:36,642 --> 00:03:39,737
She said she had to deliver a
painting before coming here.

43
00:03:40,313 --> 00:03:41,747
I see.

44
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:46,916
Listen. You say she's a real catch.
I hope you know what I'm looking for.

45
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,314
Oh, I'm well aware.

46
00:03:49,222 --> 00:03:50,918
Your late wife was very pretty...

47
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:53,251
...and when we went
to Arima this past spring....

48
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,258
No need to mention that.

49
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:59,726
There's a slight catch though.

50
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:02,594
What's that?

51
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:05,694
She had a son with her late husband.

52
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:08,435
I don't mind.
I'm in the same situation.

53
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:11,345
What did her former husband do?

54
00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:14,739
- He taught at Osaka University.
- A professor, huh?

55
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,521
He didn't run a sake brewery?

56
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:19,791
He said the family
business wasn't for him.

57
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,689
A professor's widow....

58
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:26,621
A member of the intelligentsia.

59
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:33,330
She should be here any minute.

60
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:36,372
Wouldn't it be better if I
wasn't sitting here?

61
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:39,403
- Oh?
- I'll stay out of sight for now.

62
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:42,103
When she arrives, I'll act
like I ran into you by chance.

63
00:04:42,313 --> 00:04:45,477
- Where will you be?
- Just right over there. Okay?

64
00:04:47,785 --> 00:04:49,981
- It's a great idea.
- Hey, Mr. Isomura.

65
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:53,196
If you like her, give me a signal.

66
00:04:53,648 --> 00:04:55,480
Okay, I'll rub my nose.

67
00:04:58,696 --> 00:05:00,255
Here you go.

68
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:04,797
Where did he go?

69
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:09,868
- What's all this about signals?
- We were just talking baseball.

70
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,308
Right over here.

71
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:17,644
- Welcome.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

72
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:19,612
Please have a seat.

73
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,383
Would you like anything?

74
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:28,549
I'm fine, thank you.

75
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:33,197
- Maybe later.
- Enjoy your stay.

76
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:39,400
Thanks for coming out here tonight.

77
00:05:40,071 --> 00:05:43,564
Not at all.
What did you wish to discuss?

78
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:48,172
Well, I haven't seen you in ages, and
the anniversary of Mother's death is soon.

79
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:51,645
I just wanted to catch up.
Hello there.

80
00:05:56,554 --> 00:05:59,353
- Hello, Kitagawa.
- It's been awhile.

81
00:06:01,426 --> 00:06:03,088
Yeah, not since Rokko.

82
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:07,129
Please, have a seat. Please.

83
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,232
Just for a little while, then.

84
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:15,597
- Who's this?
- She's from my wife's family.

85
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,400
- The Kohayagawas.
- I see.

86
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:20,440
I've heard about your family.
From around Midosuji right?

87
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:24,614
I work at my friend's art gallery.

88
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:27,418
I see. That's great.

89
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,589
Here's my card.

90
00:06:30,888 --> 00:06:33,687
I run a small steel mill
over by Sakaigawa.

91
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:36,587
Mr. Isomura has always helped me out.

92
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,530
It's very nice to meet you.

93
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,307
Your job seems very elegant.

94
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,687
I suppose so....

95
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,712
Do you have any paintings of
oxen at your gallery?

96
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,612
- Sorry?
- You know, cows.

97
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,357
I collect cow related things.
You see, I was born in the year of the ox.

98
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:07,687
This is a cow too.

99
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:12,159
If you had a cow painting lying around,
I'd love to take a look at it.

100
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,661
A Japanese painting?
Or perhaps a different style?

101
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:20,600
What do you think?
Should I leave it up to her?

102
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,605
- Good idea.
- I'll leave it up to you.

103
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:26,011
I'll look for one.

104
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,047
I think that Noriko may be visiting today.

105
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,744
Please excuse me while I use the phone.

106
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,020
Is there a phone?

107
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,890
- What do you think?
- Looks good. Very good.

108
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,365
- Wonderful.
- She's great.

109
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,138
You do know my tastes.
She's the right age too.

110
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,242
- Hey, I'm counting on you.
- Oh?

111
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,279
We should grab dinner.
First, let's have a drink. Hey.

112
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,984
Gin fizz sounds good right?
Three gin fizzes.

113
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:15,023
- This is great. This is better than great.
- Glad to hear it.

114
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:20,924
This calls for a celebration. A toast.

115
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,987
I'm home.

116
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:45,418
- Welcome back.
- Hi.

117
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,427
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

118
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,699
I was invited out,
but I declined and hurried home.

119
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,836
Does this look correct?
Try again.

120
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,570
This goes here, right?
So this won't work this way.

121
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,275
Think it over.

122
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,755
What did you want to discuss?

123
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,851
Well?

124
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:28,396
I was told to meet with
a prospective husband again.

125
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,570
Again? You're so popular.

126
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,338
Not like that one. This one is serious.

127
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,877
Even Fumiko is encouraging me.

128
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,581
What's he like?

129
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,176
His father is the president of a bank...

130
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,581
...but he works for a beer company.

131
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,756
Sounds good.

132
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:56,662
- It's not that easy. I'm stuck.
- What do you mean?

133
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,530
I don't really want to get married yet.

134
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,769
You'll have to eventually though.

135
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:09,307
- Why don't you meet him, at least?
- But....

136
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,938
If you don't like him, just say no.

137
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:17,078
Neither Father nor Fumiko will force you
into something that you don't want to do.

138
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,716
- You think so?
- Of course.

139
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,317
The thing is,
the store isn't doing so well...

140
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,050
...so Father really wants me to marry him.

141
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,652
I understand.

142
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,197
I have to go.

143
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,763
Is it that late?
If you hurry you can...

144
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,904
...catch the train that
leaves at 16 past the hour.

145
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,835
I'll come again some other time.

146
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,405
Thanks for talking to me, Noriko.

147
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,208
You're welcome, anytime.

148
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,411
Oh, I bought some sweets.

149
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,581
I'll have some the next time I visit.

150
00:10:57,656 --> 00:11:00,319
- See you later, Minoru.
- Goodbye.

151
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,726
You should hurry.

152
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,430
I'll see you later.

153
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,600
Take care.

154
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,230
Bye.

155
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:46,931
I heard that Okaden is going to
merge with Katsura Masamune.

156
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,576
Oh? I heard that rumor.

157
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,042
Who'd you hear the news from?

158
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,974
Do you know Kaneko?

159
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,845
- From Katsura Masamune.
- Yeah, I know him.

160
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,578
I ran into him yesterday,
and he mentioned it.

161
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,851
So I got him drunk to get some details.

162
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,592
Hello? Yes, he's here.

163
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,762
It's your wife, sir.

164
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:20,349
- Any response from Mr. Yamayoshi?
- Not yet.

165
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,976
Hello? Hello?

166
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,470
Yeah, it's me.
What do you need?

167
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,312
My uncle from Osaka just arrived.

168
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,412
If you have some time,
I wanted you to stop by.

169
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:36,813
Okay, see you then.

170
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,361
- He said he'll be right over.
- I see.

171
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,128
So, how do they feel about the situation?

172
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,797
He met her 2 or 3 days ago.

173
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,266
- Seemed very interested.
- I see.

174
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,477
What has Akiko said?

175
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,611
Well, I haven't explained it to Akiko yet.

176
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,218
So Akiko met her prospective
husband without even knowing it?

177
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:14,020
- That's right.
- That's not going to work.

178
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:17,695
Do you think Akiko will like him?

179
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,663
I think it's a pretty good match.

180
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:22,927
What do you think?

181
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:27,204
Hopefully she'll find him attractive.

182
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:31,234
Thing is, he's not a scholar like Koichi.

183
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,707
I'm worried about that.

184
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,807
He runs a steel mill.

185
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,409
That might not bother her too much.

186
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,642
Agreed.

187
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,520
That's for her to decide.

188
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,617
He's home.

189
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,955
Welcome.

190
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,835
- It's good to see you again.
- Good to see you.

191
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:58,437
It's been awhile.

192
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,436
Yanosuke has a
prospective husband for Akiko.

193
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,835
- I see.
- I think it's a good opportunity.

194
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,106
I see.

195
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:11,616
We've also got Noriko to deal with.

196
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:15,147
If they both got married,
it would be ideal.

197
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:16,956
Indeed.

198
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,352
- See how Akiko feels about this.
- And you, Father?

199
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,661
Well, I'll certainly encourage her...

200
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,625
...but do talk to her.

201
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:31,294
- Where are you off to?
- I forgot an errand.

202
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,436
If you're going out, I'll tag along.

203
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,369
Don't bother. Relax and stay awhile.

204
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:42,240
I guess he's busy too.

205
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:46,110
I don't know what he's up to,
but he's been going out often lately.

206
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,283
I see. It's good to see him
up and about.

207
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:52,548
Did Noriko decide
to meet with her suitor?

208
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,483
Yes, over at the New Osaka Hotel.

209
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,394
That's good news. I'm glad to hear it.

210
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,767
It's going to be a scorcher.

211
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,449
Yes. Yes. Where?

212
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,952
From six, right? I'll go.
I'll invite her too.

213
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:43,415
Are you free tonight?

214
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,756
I am. Why?

215
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:50,257
Mr. Teramoto is leaving
in the next 2 or 3 days.

216
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:56,836
- For Sapporo?
- Yeah, so everyone's going out tonight.

217
00:15:57,673 --> 00:15:59,869
I see. So it's finalized now.

218
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:06,343
I see.

219
00:16:11,153 --> 00:16:12,451
So he's leaving....

220
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,890
Cheers.

221
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,699
- To your health.
- And happiness.

222
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,464
Thank you, everybody.

223
00:17:05,874 --> 00:17:08,469
- So you're really going, eh?
- Do you get a raise?

224
00:17:09,478 --> 00:17:10,605
Nothing big.

225
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,673
You'd be surprised how little
teaching assistants make.

226
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,214
But you could become an
assistant professor.

227
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,117
Not much better.

228
00:17:18,921 --> 00:17:21,891
Anyway, you should all
come up to ski sometime.

229
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:25,618
I want to, but the train fare
to Sapporo is so expensive.

230
00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:29,995
In honor of you, we'll at
least make it to Mount Ibuki.

231
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,700
<i>How can I say it?</i>

232
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:34,730
<i>You do not know</i>
<i>How my love for you burns within me</i>

233
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:36,906
<i>Like the blazes of wormwood on Ibuki</i>

234
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,803
Are you flirting with us now?

235
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:44,938
That was fun.

236
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:48,434
Hanging out with everybody
makes it hard to leave.

237
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:52,638
How long are you going to be gone?

238
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:57,850
They told me 4 or 5 years,
but who knows.

239
00:18:58,854 --> 00:19:01,085
If you can, you should
come visit me sometime.

240
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,552
I'm serious.

241
00:19:07,696 --> 00:19:10,461
Tonight was fun. It made me happy.

242
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,363
I'll write you some letters.

243
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:15,264
I hope you'll do the same.

244
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:18,438
- I will.
- I'm serious.

245
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,707
What a fun night.

246
00:19:22,611 --> 00:19:23,909
I don't want to leave.

247
00:19:57,146 --> 00:19:58,739
<i>Add these up.</i>

248
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:17,999
The total is 33,455 yen.

249
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:21,563
- And you?
- The same.

250
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,865
- How much?
- 33,455 yen.

251
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:28,940
33,455 yen.

252
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,341
It's even worse than I thought.

253
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:37,177
There's nothing we can do. Smaller
companies can't compete these days.

254
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:40,087
- You think?
- Let me see the sales slip.

255
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,190
- This one?
- No, the earlier one.

256
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:47,487
This is the one.

257
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:58,965
How's it going? Mighty hot today.

258
00:21:02,077 --> 00:21:03,511
Where is Hisao?

259
00:21:03,946 --> 00:21:05,574
He left a minute ago.

260
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:06,882
Know where he went?

261
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:10,978
- To Katsura Masamune.
- I see. I'll go over there too.

262
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:15,185
Take care.

263
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,667
He's been going out a lot lately.

264
00:21:25,634 --> 00:21:27,933
He does leave often.
One wonders where he goes.

265
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:30,738
Hey, listen.

266
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,453
You know how he's been
going out? I think it's a bit fishy.

267
00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:53,260
His family is worried about him too.
So I want you to go....

268
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:56,164
- To his home?
- No, no. Just follow him.

269
00:21:56,765 --> 00:21:59,826
- Right now?
- Yes, I want you to see where he goes.

270
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:48,710
- Hey, Roku!
- Hello.

271
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,072
Where are you off to?
Come join me for a minute.

272
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:05,926
Have a seat. Sit.

273
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:08,162
Thank you.
Excuse me.

274
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:13,668
You want anything?

275
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,699
- Anything's fine.
<i>- Shiratama</i> sound good?

276
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,103
Sounds great.

277
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:23,638
Add a <i>shiratama</i> to my order.

278
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,575
Quite a coincidence, running into you.

279
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,077
I'm out collecting some debts.

280
00:24:32,788 --> 00:24:35,348
I see. A hard worker.

281
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:41,263
It's hot today.

282
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,191
Yes, the summer refuses to end.

283
00:24:48,303 --> 00:24:49,862
Where are you headed?

284
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:52,399
Who are you collecting from today?

285
00:24:53,642 --> 00:24:55,474
Oh, here and there....

286
00:24:57,546 --> 00:24:58,980
Hey....

287
00:24:59,714 --> 00:25:02,206
- Do you have any cigarettes?
- Yes.

288
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:04,283
- Let me have one.
- Please.

289
00:25:07,022 --> 00:25:08,388
"Peace," huh?

290
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,949
You're smoking the good stuff.

291
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,794
Sorry.

292
00:25:14,162 --> 00:25:15,721
Listen....

293
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:20,592
- I already know.
- What do you mean?

294
00:25:21,036 --> 00:25:22,504
Don't worry.

295
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:24,696
Hey....

296
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,606
Hisao sent you, didn't he?

297
00:25:28,043 --> 00:25:31,309
No, sir, not at all.
That's not the case at all.

298
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:33,272
I see.

299
00:25:34,483 --> 00:25:35,883
So who asked you to do it?

300
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:38,819
The debts.

301
00:25:39,154 --> 00:25:42,784
Oh, the debts. I'm never told to do it.
I just get up and go.

302
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,155
I see. That's very impressive.

303
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:48,621
Hey, is that <i>shiratama</i> ready yet?

304
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:52,228
He's busy. He has to collect debts all day.

305
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:55,403
- Hurry, will you?
- Coming right up, sir.

306
00:26:00,408 --> 00:26:02,309
You really are a hard worker, Roku.

307
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,232
Anybody home?

308
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,143
Hello there.

309
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:43,984
How good of you to visit, despite the heat.
Please, come in.

310
00:26:45,554 --> 00:26:46,817
Don't mind if I do.

311
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:49,018
By all means.

312
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,359
- It's so hot this year.
- I'll say.

313
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:03,435
Is the store busy these days?

314
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:06,667
Actually, this is the slowest time of year.

315
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:10,045
Sake shops can't make
money without new rice crops.

316
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,552
- Something funny happened just now.
- What's that?

317
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:22,789
Our store manager was following me.

318
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:28,559
- Why?
- I've been coming here recently, right?

319
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,394
My family's worried about me.

320
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,999
So, just now...

321
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,674
...I pulled the manager into a nearby cafe.

322
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:46,077
He had "Peace" cigarettes
on him, so I took one...

323
00:27:46,648 --> 00:27:48,378
...but he was so nervous...

324
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,075
...that he ended up paying for
the <i>shiratama</i> I got him.

325
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:54,547
Is that so? Good for you.

326
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:04,358
- Did you want sugar in your barley tea?
- Don't worry about it.

327
00:28:16,478 --> 00:28:19,346
- Strange, isn't it?
- What is?

328
00:28:19,914 --> 00:28:23,715
If I hadn't taken that exact train
on that day in Mukoumachi...

329
00:28:23,918 --> 00:28:25,284
...I wouldn't have seen you.

330
00:28:25,887 --> 00:28:29,153
It's true. That's destiny for you.

331
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,152
Yes, destiny is a strange thing.

332
00:28:33,728 --> 00:28:37,688
- It's been 19 years.
- And of all places.

333
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,434
We've both changed so much.

334
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,162
On the way home from
a bicycle race, no less.

335
00:28:46,107 --> 00:28:47,939
Like life and the flow of water....

336
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,705
Indeed. The world has changed
so much around us.

337
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,007
- It's not much of a world anymore.
- I miss the old days.

338
00:28:55,684 --> 00:28:59,348
- Remember the cafe at Uji?
- Yes. Hanayashiki.

339
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:01,616
We used to go there often.

340
00:29:02,357 --> 00:29:06,658
It was such fun to have you
take me out on long vacations.

341
00:29:09,264 --> 00:29:10,698
Yes, going to see the snow...

342
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,098
...chasing fireflies....

343
00:29:14,402 --> 00:29:16,962
Do you remember that night,
when the moon was beautiful?

344
00:29:18,106 --> 00:29:19,438
How could I forget?

345
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:21,972
It's the night
you turned me into a woman.

346
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,905
- We've known each other forever.
- Indeed.

347
00:29:27,215 --> 00:29:29,582
Yuriko is going to turn 21.

348
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:31,078
How times flies.

349
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,019
We should go visit Uji again.
Just the two of us.

350
00:29:34,222 --> 00:29:36,248
Sounds good. I'd be delighted.

351
00:29:37,158 --> 00:29:38,956
- Care for some sake?
- Sounds good.

352
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:09,387
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

353
00:30:11,326 --> 00:30:12,487
Your father is here.

354
00:30:13,762 --> 00:30:15,196
Oh yeah?

355
00:30:25,168 --> 00:30:26,966
Welcome back.

356
00:30:28,605 --> 00:30:30,972
Hi, Father. When did you get here?

357
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:33,034
Have a seat.

358
00:30:33,576 --> 00:30:37,672
I have to leave again. I forgot something.
But stay awhile.

359
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:40,117
You're going out again?

360
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,616
Yep. I'll see you later. Bye.

361
00:30:43,953 --> 00:30:45,319
Bye.

362
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,828
Father, when are you going to get me
that mink stole you promised me?

363
00:30:54,297 --> 00:30:57,096
Oh, that thing?
It's still too hot for a scarf.

364
00:30:57,867 --> 00:30:59,859
Well if I don't start asking now....

365
00:31:00,303 --> 00:31:01,931
Oh I know, I know.

366
00:31:07,443 --> 00:31:08,775
That girl is full of energy.

367
00:31:36,206 --> 00:31:39,040
Oh, hello.
Nice to see you.

368
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,569
Good afternoon.

369
00:31:43,613 --> 00:31:45,741
Yuriko, George is waiting for you.

370
00:31:47,584 --> 00:31:49,314
Hurry up now.

371
00:31:54,724 --> 00:31:56,215
I'm going, Mother.

372
00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:00,622
Don't stay out too late.

373
00:32:24,153 --> 00:32:28,557
- Who was that?
- An American. He works in Kobe.

374
00:32:29,525 --> 00:32:30,993
That's who she dates?

375
00:32:32,228 --> 00:32:36,495
She's a typist. Sometimes she
brings home strange things.

376
00:32:37,033 --> 00:32:39,559
I see. It's not a big deal?

377
00:32:42,238 --> 00:32:45,538
Things are different from
when we were young.

378
00:32:45,842 --> 00:32:47,743
These days, kids take care of themselves.

379
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:50,873
Try one of these black things.

380
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:54,741
- What is it?
- Yuriko brought it home.

381
00:32:55,518 --> 00:32:57,146
She said they're shark eggs.

382
00:33:01,057 --> 00:33:02,320
Shark eggs, huh?

383
00:33:03,493 --> 00:33:05,257
Pretty small for a shark.

384
00:33:05,528 --> 00:33:06,621
I think so too.

385
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,159
Take those home, if you like.
We have plenty more.

386
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:12,067
Thanks.

387
00:33:15,972 --> 00:33:17,440
Tastes good.

388
00:33:20,076 --> 00:33:21,271
Let's have a drink.

389
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:22,604
Thank you.

390
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:53,574
So what did you do?

391
00:33:53,976 --> 00:33:55,103
Not to worry.

392
00:33:55,812 --> 00:33:58,611
He thought he had lost me,
but I followed him the whole time.

393
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:00,144
Where did he go?

394
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,919
It looked like an inn.
The lanterns said "Sasaki."

395
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,678
- Sasaki?
- You know them?

396
00:34:04,887 --> 00:34:07,288
Continue your story.
What was the woman like?

397
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:11,024
She was slender, maybe
in her early forties.

398
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:14,123
A bit older, no? 47 or 48.

399
00:34:14,731 --> 00:34:16,222
- You know her?
- Never mind.

400
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:21,231
I hoped their relationship would be
another casualty of the war.

401
00:34:21,604 --> 00:34:22,572
Tell me more.

402
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:26,498
Mr. Yamaguchi.... Did he have a
daughter with that woman?

403
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:28,701
- A daughter?
- Twenty-one years old, very pretty.

404
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:31,608
- No.
- But she was calling him "Father."

405
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:35,151
He's the only one who believes
that she is his daughter.

406
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:36,419
Anything else?

407
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:40,989
I heard a <i>shamisen</i> playing for about 30
minutes, accompanied by his singing.

408
00:34:41,457 --> 00:34:43,153
He was singing a <i>nagauta.</i>

409
00:34:43,526 --> 00:34:46,018
No, no. That's a <i>hauta</i>, not a <i>nagauta.</i>

410
00:34:49,866 --> 00:34:51,994
- That song, right?
- Yes, that's the one.

411
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:53,462
I knew it.

412
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,704
That's all he ever sings.

413
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,298
Who is that woman?

414
00:34:57,707 --> 00:34:58,834
- From Gion?
- Nope.

415
00:34:59,075 --> 00:35:00,634
- From Minami?
- She's not a Geisha.

416
00:35:00,843 --> 00:35:02,675
- She's an old flame.
- An old flame?

417
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,240
Mr. Kohayagawa used to
be a carefree man.

418
00:35:06,949 --> 00:35:09,509
Even his parents had to
deal with that woman.

419
00:35:10,553 --> 00:35:11,919
I see.

420
00:35:12,121 --> 00:35:16,559
Just when I thought things were calming
down, we've got another headache.

421
00:35:42,685 --> 00:35:45,154
- I'm putting your clothes here.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

422
00:36:11,848 --> 00:36:13,407
Welcome back.

423
00:36:15,518 --> 00:36:16,781
What is it you need?

424
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:18,453
The postcard from Mr. Yamayoshi.

425
00:36:22,792 --> 00:36:23,816
Here it is.

426
00:36:25,761 --> 00:36:27,559
Hey, Father's at it again.

427
00:36:28,231 --> 00:36:30,894
She supposedly lives in Kyoto.

428
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:34,327
Where in Kyoto?

429
00:36:34,871 --> 00:36:36,897
- She's called Sasaki.
- Sasaki?

430
00:36:37,273 --> 00:36:38,866
Tsune Sasaki.

431
00:36:42,845 --> 00:36:45,405
She's the woman that Father
used to see in Osaka.

432
00:36:46,549 --> 00:36:48,814
- That's the one.
- I see.

433
00:36:49,685 --> 00:36:51,586
I was still young back then...

434
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:55,185
...but I remember her bringing
Father home late at night...

435
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:57,489
...and Mother crying because of it.

436
00:36:58,094 --> 00:36:59,426
Yeah. That's her.

437
00:36:59,962 --> 00:37:01,328
The old flame is flaring up.

438
00:37:01,864 --> 00:37:05,892
I wish Father would act
appropriately for his age.

439
00:37:07,703 --> 00:37:09,763
I wonder if he even
worries about the store.

440
00:37:12,074 --> 00:37:15,374
Now I wish he was just wasting his
money at the bicycle races.

441
00:37:16,712 --> 00:37:18,010
One thing after another.

442
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:19,574
Unbelievable.

443
00:37:21,183 --> 00:37:24,483
Just be sure that you don't
interrogate Father over this.

444
00:37:25,021 --> 00:37:27,957
- Why not?
- Well, of course it's better to keep quiet...

445
00:37:28,157 --> 00:37:30,956
- ...unless it comes up.
- No, I'm going to speak to him.

446
00:37:31,193 --> 00:37:33,389
No, no. He's an old man.

447
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,692
Well, then he should act like one.

448
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,995
You know how he is.

449
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,769
What are you saying?

450
00:37:44,407 --> 00:37:46,672
Is that an excuse
to do as you please?

451
00:37:47,143 --> 00:37:48,304
That's not what I mean.

452
00:37:48,744 --> 00:37:52,203
But at this point, Father's
personality isn't going to change.

453
00:37:52,982 --> 00:37:54,450
I'll yell at him until it does.

454
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:57,213
Don't bother. You'll just
make a mess of things.

455
00:38:04,894 --> 00:38:06,260
That was a good bath.

456
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,660
Hey, listen to this.

457
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,502
I was thinking while taking a bath...

458
00:38:16,706 --> 00:38:19,073
...that for the anniversary of
your mother's death...

459
00:38:19,275 --> 00:38:23,235
...we should stop by her grave, and then
have lunch over at Arashiyama.

460
00:38:23,546 --> 00:38:25,310
We did the formal ceremony last year.

461
00:38:26,082 --> 00:38:27,983
Yes, that sounds good.

462
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:31,279
Mother really liked Arashiyama.
What do you think?

463
00:38:33,222 --> 00:38:34,713
Arashiyama in Kyoto, right?

464
00:38:35,424 --> 00:38:36,551
Of course it's in Kyoto.

465
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:40,919
Mother liked Kyoto, but you
really seem to love it there.

466
00:38:41,731 --> 00:38:42,699
What do you mean?

467
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:46,636
You seem to be going there often. Is
something captivating your attention?

468
00:38:47,203 --> 00:38:48,603
What?

469
00:38:51,774 --> 00:38:53,970
- Listen--
- Be quiet. I said be quiet!

470
00:38:56,078 --> 00:38:57,410
Father...

471
00:38:57,613 --> 00:39:00,845
...are you going to do the same thing
that made Mother cry so long ago?

472
00:39:02,852 --> 00:39:05,185
What? What do you mean?

473
00:39:05,388 --> 00:39:07,084
I already know everything.

474
00:39:07,957 --> 00:39:08,925
Know what?

475
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:12,020
Why can't we go to Arashiyama?

476
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:15,463
Who knows what you
mean by "Arashiyama."

477
00:39:16,265 --> 00:39:18,757
Hey. Hey, look at me.

478
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:22,737
You two suspect me of doing something?

479
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,866
- Right?
- No, not at all.

480
00:39:29,111 --> 00:39:31,637
Having Roku follow after me?

481
00:39:32,682 --> 00:39:35,049
Is there something that you
wouldn't want him to see?

482
00:39:35,584 --> 00:39:36,950
What?

483
00:39:38,054 --> 00:39:41,513
The reason I've been
going to Kyoto often...

484
00:39:42,425 --> 00:39:46,624
...is to discuss the store's affairs
with an old friend of mine.

485
00:39:46,996 --> 00:39:47,964
Watch what you say.

486
00:39:48,631 --> 00:39:50,429
Who's this old friend?
Give me a name.

487
00:39:50,966 --> 00:39:53,458
Let me guess. Is it Sasaki?

488
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,803
No. It's Yamada.

489
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,609
- You know.
- Never heard of him.

490
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,339
That's your problem.

491
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:08,183
I've asked him for various favors
concerning the store.

492
00:40:09,285 --> 00:40:11,254
Since you can't seem to keep it in order.

493
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,950
- Well, then....
- That's enough.

494
00:40:14,156 --> 00:40:15,488
No, it's not. Be quiet.

495
00:40:16,125 --> 00:40:17,616
- Tell me, Father....
- What?

496
00:40:17,827 --> 00:40:19,955
Are you really worried about the store?

497
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,596
- Of course!
- If it's that serious...

498
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:24,494
...why don't you go over there again?

499
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,026
- What?
- Hurry up and get ready.

500
00:40:28,037 --> 00:40:31,974
There's no need to go today.
I spoke with him yesterday.

501
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:35,243
No, these things should be
taken care of immediately.

502
00:40:35,511 --> 00:40:37,002
You should leave right away.

503
00:40:38,647 --> 00:40:40,206
Not today.

504
00:40:41,217 --> 00:40:42,549
I've already taken my bath.

505
00:40:43,252 --> 00:40:44,720
I'll prepare another.

506
00:41:12,648 --> 00:41:13,707
Go ahead, Father.

507
00:41:15,818 --> 00:41:18,447
Go and ask for his help.

508
00:41:20,456 --> 00:41:23,290
So you guys don't believe me, huh?

509
00:41:24,326 --> 00:41:25,294
Fine, I'll go!

510
00:41:27,263 --> 00:41:30,199
If you're so suspicious...

511
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:33,727
...be sure to have Roku follow me!
Ridiculous!

512
00:41:44,513 --> 00:41:47,005
It's sad that you can't trust your father.

513
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:53,553
Hey, I'm going.

514
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,715
Be sure to follow me!

515
00:41:56,659 --> 00:41:58,059
Make sure to see where I go!

516
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:12,373
I'm leaving! Let's go!

517
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:17,903
Here I go! Watch me!

518
00:42:22,885 --> 00:42:24,945
Fools. This is nonsense.

519
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:32,555
Should we let him go?
Will he be okay?

520
00:42:32,862 --> 00:42:35,491
He'll be fine. He didn't
even take his wallet.

521
00:42:36,165 --> 00:42:38,396
He'll wander around the
block and come home.

522
00:42:38,968 --> 00:42:40,368
You think?

523
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,672
- I hope so....
- He needs the exercise.

524
00:43:18,507 --> 00:43:19,839
You're in the way.

525
00:43:35,424 --> 00:43:39,555
Mother, is that man really my father?

526
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:44,564
- Why do you ask?
- I was just thinking...

527
00:43:45,367 --> 00:43:48,394
...when I was small, wasn't
it somebody else?

528
00:43:49,171 --> 00:43:52,869
I feel like I called him "Father" as well.

529
00:43:53,442 --> 00:43:54,432
Is that so?

530
00:43:56,078 --> 00:43:57,444
Perhaps.

531
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,373
So which one is my real father?

532
00:44:02,284 --> 00:44:03,775
Why does it matter?

533
00:44:04,987 --> 00:44:06,546
It's up to you.

534
00:44:07,756 --> 00:44:09,315
You don't know?

535
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:12,993
I mean, I guess I don't mind either one.

536
00:44:13,595 --> 00:44:15,461
I was born and here I am.

537
00:44:16,265 --> 00:44:17,790
That's all that matters.

538
00:44:18,701 --> 00:44:21,569
Yes, that's right.
Think of it that way.

539
00:44:25,808 --> 00:44:27,709
- Hey.
- What?

540
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:30,973
Is this father rich?

541
00:44:31,747 --> 00:44:34,911
I'm sure he is. He owns a sake brewery.

542
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:39,610
I see. He still hasn't
gotten me the mink stole.

543
00:44:41,223 --> 00:44:42,521
It's in the way that you ask.

544
00:44:43,826 --> 00:44:45,158
It's all in how you ask.

545
00:44:46,862 --> 00:44:51,732
I see. Well he's certainly my father until
he gets me that mink stole.

546
00:44:52,668 --> 00:44:54,500
That sounds good.

547
00:44:58,273 --> 00:45:00,504
I'm here. I came back.

548
00:45:04,477 --> 00:45:06,105
Well, hello.

549
00:45:06,479 --> 00:45:07,606
Hi, Father.

550
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:10,339
Cleaning the floors?

551
00:45:11,818 --> 00:45:13,013
Staying at home today, eh?

552
00:45:16,356 --> 00:45:19,326
Here, let me do that.
I'm part of the family, after all.

553
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:26,529
Father, you have to take off your
<i>tabi</i> if you're going to do that.

554
00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:29,896
You're right. Very observant.

555
00:45:31,371 --> 00:45:35,502
I forgot my wallet at home, so I
was wandering around broke.

556
00:45:36,009 --> 00:45:39,207
The cigarette shop lent me 1,000 yen.

557
00:45:39,646 --> 00:45:40,944
I'll get you some <i>shiratama.</i>

558
00:45:41,514 --> 00:45:43,244
I don't want any <i>shiratama.</i>

559
00:45:43,716 --> 00:45:44,684
Father...

560
00:45:45,585 --> 00:45:47,213
...won't you buy me that mink stole?

561
00:45:47,921 --> 00:45:48,945
I'll get it for you.

562
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,738
You're good at that, Father.

563
00:47:30,356 --> 00:47:31,380
Hello.

564
00:47:32,759 --> 00:47:34,955
Good to see you.

565
00:47:35,662 --> 00:47:37,631
I'm sorry about the other night.

566
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:40,129
Don't worry about it.

567
00:47:42,769 --> 00:47:46,672
Were you able to find
any ox paintings?

568
00:47:46,873 --> 00:47:48,273
I'm still trying....

569
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:51,074
He's quite amusing, isn't he?

570
00:47:54,047 --> 00:47:56,073
He's an interesting fellow.

571
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,610
Did Fumiko speak with you?

572
00:48:03,156 --> 00:48:05,284
I see. What do you think?

573
00:48:07,126 --> 00:48:12,463
It's very sudden.
I would like some time to think it over.

574
00:48:12,665 --> 00:48:17,433
Yes, certainly. Please do.

575
00:48:17,637 --> 00:48:20,664
Your father is very worried about you.

576
00:48:21,074 --> 00:48:23,305
I'm sorry to trouble everyone.

577
00:48:23,643 --> 00:48:25,305
Not at all.

578
00:48:26,012 --> 00:48:29,449
Would you like to meet with him again?

579
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:33,945
He would really like to.
What do you think?

580
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:39,453
He was disheartened
after you left early the other day.

581
00:48:48,334 --> 00:48:51,498
I hear that you're going to Arashiyama
for Mother's memorial service.

582
00:48:53,439 --> 00:48:54,998
Yes, that's what I heard.

583
00:48:55,208 --> 00:48:57,404
You're going, right?

584
00:48:57,877 --> 00:49:02,110
It should be beautiful there
at this time of year.

585
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:56,594
Pass that to me.

586
00:49:59,506 --> 00:50:01,668
- Hisao?
- Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

587
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:05,744
- You don't drink much?
- Beer fills me up rather quickly.

588
00:50:08,615 --> 00:50:13,383
Say, brother, I'm surprised
at how fast the moss grew.

589
00:50:14,521 --> 00:50:15,489
The moss?

590
00:50:16,023 --> 00:50:18,356
The gravestone was covered with moss.

591
00:50:19,092 --> 00:50:21,027
Indeed it was.

592
00:50:21,228 --> 00:50:23,754
They do say "until the moss grows."
It was rather quick.

593
00:50:23,964 --> 00:50:26,160
Time flies, doesn't it?

594
00:50:26,366 --> 00:50:31,600
It's already been six years since
Koichi died and Akiko became a widow.

595
00:50:34,274 --> 00:50:35,537
Where is Akiko?

596
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:39,413
She went out with Noriko.

597
00:50:39,827 --> 00:50:41,377
I see.

598
00:50:44,885 --> 00:50:46,547
About Akiko....

599
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:48,984
Her suitor seems very interested.

600
00:50:49,189 --> 00:50:51,818
He has two children.

601
00:50:52,025 --> 00:50:53,857
A girl and a younger boy.

602
00:50:54,061 --> 00:50:56,826
He's glad that Akiko also has a child.

603
00:50:57,197 --> 00:51:00,099
That's good. What do you think?

604
00:51:01,301 --> 00:51:02,894
That's good to hear.

605
00:51:03,103 --> 00:51:06,596
The issue is how Akiko
feels about the situation.

606
00:51:07,074 --> 00:51:10,340
You know,
feelings can't determine everything.

607
00:51:10,544 --> 00:51:14,311
Akiko is still young.
She has a future.

608
00:51:14,514 --> 00:51:17,541
Is she going to stay single forever?

609
00:51:17,751 --> 00:51:18,946
That would be unfortunate.

610
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:21,212
I suppose so.

611
00:51:21,421 --> 00:51:25,552
Akiko is one thing, but how
is Noriko feeling about her situation?

612
00:51:25,759 --> 00:51:28,024
She's already met her suitor.

613
00:51:28,261 --> 00:51:30,992
Fumiko, have you asked her?

614
00:51:31,465 --> 00:51:34,526
Yes, I did speak with her.

615
00:51:35,302 --> 00:51:36,429
What did she say?

616
00:51:37,204 --> 00:51:39,105
She was being rather ambiguous.

617
00:51:40,107 --> 00:51:41,632
She's still unsure.

618
00:51:43,543 --> 00:51:44,875
I see.

619
00:51:45,078 --> 00:51:47,479
She needs to decide soon.

620
00:51:47,681 --> 00:51:51,777
I think it's a great match.
Especially if her suitor is interested.

621
00:51:52,419 --> 00:51:55,981
I agree, but my wife says that
you must not rush into these things.

622
00:51:56,189 --> 00:51:58,124
No, she should hurry.

623
00:51:58,325 --> 00:52:02,194
Don't you think so, Fumiko?

624
00:52:02,396 --> 00:52:03,887
Brother?

625
00:52:05,665 --> 00:52:08,658
Well, I suppose it can't hurt.

626
00:52:09,669 --> 00:52:12,764
With so many captains,
this ship will end up in the mountains.

627
00:52:12,973 --> 00:52:16,410
You all need to listen to how she feels.

628
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:21,310
Father, don't you need to go
somewhere now that we're in Kyoto?

629
00:52:22,516 --> 00:52:23,484
Excuse me?

630
00:52:30,724 --> 00:52:33,159
- Another?
- Thank you.

631
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:51,200
There they are.

632
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:05,988
Really? And then what?

633
00:53:06,193 --> 00:53:09,652
He ate everything
that they put in front of him.

634
00:53:09,863 --> 00:53:14,028
Then he loosened his belt!
He ate so much.

635
00:53:14,234 --> 00:53:16,135
He must have been famished.

636
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,198
I suppose.

637
00:53:18,405 --> 00:53:22,809
After the dinner at the hotel,
we were walking through Nakanoshima--

638
00:53:23,009 --> 00:53:25,604
You two were alone?

639
00:53:25,812 --> 00:53:28,805
Yes, everyone insisted.

640
00:53:29,282 --> 00:53:31,376
I see. What happened?

641
00:53:31,585 --> 00:53:35,249
He asked me
if I disliked Western cuisine.

642
00:53:35,455 --> 00:53:37,185
So I said, "What about you?"

643
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:42,556
And after eating all that food,
he said that he isn't too fond of it!

644
00:53:42,762 --> 00:53:44,162
Such a peculiar man!

645
00:53:44,664 --> 00:53:46,724
He sounds entertaining.

646
00:53:46,933 --> 00:53:48,162
What happened next?

647
00:53:48,568 --> 00:53:52,801
He saw that nobody was around,
so he grabbed my hand and squeezed it.

648
00:53:54,641 --> 00:53:56,269
And what did you do?

649
00:53:56,476 --> 00:53:59,674
- I squeezed right back.
- And then?

650
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:04,409
He said that my hand
was cold and wouldn't let go.

651
00:54:04,618 --> 00:54:06,610
His hand was warm.

652
00:54:06,953 --> 00:54:10,913
But when we were near other people,
he would try to let go in a hurry.

653
00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:14,253
So I wouldn't let go
of his hand on purpose.

654
00:54:14,561 --> 00:54:15,620
And then?

655
00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:20,062
Oh, Akiko, you're making me
do all the talking!

656
00:54:20,267 --> 00:54:22,293
How are things?

657
00:54:22,769 --> 00:54:23,964
What do you mean?

658
00:54:24,171 --> 00:54:26,140
The suitor that Uncle Yanosuke set up.

659
00:54:27,674 --> 00:54:29,700
Oh, I'm already an old lady....

660
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:31,808
That'll be 100 yen.

661
00:54:32,345 --> 00:54:33,540
What?

662
00:54:33,747 --> 00:54:38,208
You promised me that you'd give me
100 yen each time you called yourself old.

663
00:54:38,418 --> 00:54:40,353
Oh, you're right!

664
00:54:42,923 --> 00:54:44,915
- Here you go, 100 yen.
- Why, thank you.

665
00:54:46,593 --> 00:54:48,824
Masao, be careful.

666
00:54:54,968 --> 00:54:58,564
Minoru, please keep an eye on him.

667
00:55:04,911 --> 00:55:08,313
So how do you feel about your proposal?

668
00:55:08,682 --> 00:55:10,480
I mean, I'm just....

669
00:55:13,653 --> 00:55:16,020
I haven't said anything yet!

670
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:19,250
I jumped the gun.

671
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:25,196
Such gorgeous weather.

672
00:55:43,717 --> 00:55:46,653
Today was quite fun indeed.

673
00:55:46,853 --> 00:55:48,879
It's nice to go on excursions like that.

674
00:55:49,089 --> 00:55:51,684
- Yes, we should do it more often.
- Certainly.

675
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:54,258
It was such a nice day too.

676
00:55:55,362 --> 00:55:59,390
Yes, it was. Don't you agree, Fumiko?

677
00:56:01,034 --> 00:56:03,868
Yes, but I feel bad for Father.

678
00:56:04,671 --> 00:56:07,436
- Why?
- We made it all the way to Kyoto.

679
00:56:07,641 --> 00:56:10,736
This again? You're so stubborn.

680
00:56:12,412 --> 00:56:14,574
Father, would you like to get some rest?

681
00:56:14,814 --> 00:56:17,579
Sounds like a good idea.

682
00:56:17,784 --> 00:56:20,253
The time is right.

683
00:56:20,954 --> 00:56:22,923
Noriko, please help him.

684
00:56:23,123 --> 00:56:26,491
Good night.

685
00:56:32,365 --> 00:56:36,803
Did you have to bring it up?
He was in such a good mood.

686
00:56:37,237 --> 00:56:40,435
It's better that I said something.
I should have said more.

687
00:56:42,509 --> 00:56:44,944
I should probably leave as well.

688
00:56:46,846 --> 00:56:47,973
It's still early.

689
00:56:48,181 --> 00:56:50,047
Yes, but....

690
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:53,482
Minoru, we should get going.

691
00:56:57,824 --> 00:56:59,452
We're going, dear.

692
00:57:01,328 --> 00:57:02,921
You should stay a while.

693
00:57:03,129 --> 00:57:05,155
Oh, I know, but....

694
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:07,167
It's Father!

695
00:57:07,367 --> 00:57:09,927
- What?
- He's collapsed!

696
00:57:23,216 --> 00:57:24,275
Father?

697
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:28,648
- Father!
- Father.

698
00:57:28,855 --> 00:57:31,222
Noriko, call a doctor.

699
00:57:32,692 --> 00:57:33,955
Father.

700
00:57:48,041 --> 00:57:51,307
Hello, 30-1051, please.

701
00:58:01,771 --> 00:58:05,139
Hello, 30-1051, please.

702
00:58:53,556 --> 00:58:54,854
How does he look?

703
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:59,391
He should be okay,
barring another attack.

704
00:58:59,595 --> 00:59:01,461
You know, he's rather old though.

705
00:59:42,405 --> 00:59:44,067
Hello, Aunt Teruko.

706
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:50,580
- What happened?
- What's going on?

707
00:59:50,813 --> 00:59:52,509
He looked fine this afternoon.

708
00:59:53,683 --> 00:59:55,584
We came home,
and all of a sudden....

709
00:59:55,785 --> 00:59:57,151
How does he look?

710
00:59:57,353 --> 00:59:58,878
It was a heart attack.

711
00:59:59,088 --> 01:00:02,320
The doctor said he should be okay
if nothing worsens overnight.

712
01:00:02,525 --> 01:00:03,823
I see.

713
01:00:04,026 --> 01:00:05,722
Have you told everyone?

714
01:00:05,928 --> 01:00:08,022
Yes, I sent out a telegram.

715
01:00:08,231 --> 01:00:10,791
I see. Let's go see him.

716
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:31,007
It was so sudden.

717
01:01:31,213 --> 01:01:32,681
Very much so.

718
01:01:32,882 --> 01:01:35,681
I wasn't expecting it.

719
01:01:35,885 --> 01:01:38,411
Did he have heart problems before?

720
01:01:38,621 --> 01:01:41,455
No, a bad liver.

721
01:01:42,725 --> 01:01:44,785
Who is the man who just arrived?

722
01:01:44,994 --> 01:01:46,758
His younger brother.

723
01:01:47,129 --> 01:01:50,190
- From Nagoya?
- No, he's from Tokyo.

724
01:01:50,399 --> 01:01:54,461
The woman who came here earlier today
is from Nagoya. She's his younger sister.

725
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:56,532
So she's the older sister of the....

726
01:01:56,739 --> 01:01:59,299
No, no. Listen up.

727
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:03,843
The woman from Nagoya and the wife
of the gentleman from Osaka--

728
01:02:04,046 --> 01:02:05,537
Wait, now I'm confused.

729
01:02:05,781 --> 01:02:11,015
Okay, the wife of the man
from Osaka is Mr. Kohayagawa's--

730
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:12,620
He was an orphan, you know.

731
01:02:12,822 --> 01:02:16,520
Is his dead wife's younger sister.

732
01:02:16,859 --> 01:02:18,623
I see.

733
01:02:18,861 --> 01:02:20,056
Very complicated.

734
01:02:20,262 --> 01:02:23,027
The Kohayagawa family
is complicated indeed.

735
01:02:38,381 --> 01:02:42,148
Auntie, you must be tired.
Would you care to rest?

736
01:02:42,852 --> 01:02:45,344
Oh, no. I'm fine.

737
01:02:45,554 --> 01:02:46,522
What about you?

738
01:02:47,189 --> 01:02:49,090
I'm fine.

739
01:02:50,359 --> 01:02:53,887
Are you sure? You must be exhausted
from riding the train all night.

740
01:02:54,096 --> 01:02:56,725
No, I'm fine.

741
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,860
Have you been busy lately?

742
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:02,732
Yes, relatively.

743
01:03:02,938 --> 01:03:03,997
And you?

744
01:03:04,206 --> 01:03:07,802
Busy as usual.

745
01:03:10,279 --> 01:03:11,247
How's he doing?

746
01:03:11,847 --> 01:03:14,942
He's sound asleep for now.

747
01:03:15,518 --> 01:03:18,010
That's a good sign.

748
01:03:18,387 --> 01:03:19,946
He needs to recover.

749
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:24,583
This must be difficult for you, Hisao.

750
01:03:25,161 --> 01:03:26,356
Such a critical time.

751
01:03:27,263 --> 01:03:30,722
Yes, it's hard.

752
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:35,201
I think he's through the worst of it.

753
01:03:35,404 --> 01:03:36,963
He seems to be stable.

754
01:03:37,373 --> 01:03:39,103
Yes.

755
01:03:39,642 --> 01:03:42,271
I hope so.

756
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:44,940
It's already 5.

757
01:03:45,347 --> 01:03:50,684
If he's okay,
I'd like to return to Nagoya.

758
01:03:51,053 --> 01:03:52,885
I left things unattended.

759
01:03:53,422 --> 01:03:55,982
Same here.

760
01:03:56,192 --> 01:03:58,218
- Are you busy?
- Yes.

761
01:03:58,427 --> 01:04:00,623
I have a large meeting to attend.

762
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:02,321
You too, Auntie?

763
01:04:02,531 --> 01:04:04,227
Yes.

764
01:04:04,467 --> 01:04:07,437
I suppose I could stay...

765
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:10,339
...but we're building a new factory.

766
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,140
I do wish that both of you would stay.

767
01:04:14,343 --> 01:04:16,812
Everything's up in the air right now.

768
01:04:17,012 --> 01:04:21,177
Yes, I agree. You never know....

769
01:04:27,356 --> 01:04:29,154
What's wrong?

770
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:31,259
What is it?

771
01:04:35,164 --> 01:04:36,792
Father!

772
01:04:44,306 --> 01:04:45,740
Father?

773
01:04:45,941 --> 01:04:46,965
Are you okay?

774
01:04:47,176 --> 01:04:49,111
Should you be up?

775
01:04:51,881 --> 01:04:54,646
I slept quite well.

776
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:56,148
I have to use the bathroom.

777
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:22,371
What happened?

778
01:05:22,578 --> 01:05:23,944
Is he all right?

779
01:05:24,146 --> 01:05:26,445
I tried to stop him.

780
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:32,487
Well, this is a good sign.

781
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,269
I'm so glad that he's okay.

782
01:05:48,404 --> 01:05:49,667
I'm so relieved.

783
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:49,458
Father has all of his energy back.

784
01:06:49,665 --> 01:06:50,633
Yes.

785
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:53,928
I can't believe how worried we were.

786
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:11,278
You throw like a girl, Grandpa!

787
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,922
Just give me one more chance!

788
01:07:16,158 --> 01:07:17,387
Where is Minoru?

789
01:07:17,593 --> 01:07:19,585
- On a hiking trip.
- Where to?

790
01:07:19,795 --> 01:07:20,854
Mount Rokko.

791
01:07:21,063 --> 01:07:23,794
I wish I could spend my Sunday
doing that.

792
01:07:23,999 --> 01:07:27,492
He invited me, but I didn't want
to ruin the kid's fun...

793
01:07:27,703 --> 01:07:29,035
...being so....

794
01:07:30,272 --> 01:07:32,798
- What?
- One hundred yen.

795
01:07:33,008 --> 01:07:34,203
I didn't say it.

796
01:07:34,410 --> 01:07:35,969
Oh, come on!

797
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:48,921
Would you like some help?

798
01:07:49,124 --> 01:07:51,559
No, this is the last of it.

799
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,730
Can you hand that to me?

800
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:56,660
This?

801
01:08:01,437 --> 01:08:04,134
Even on a Sunday,
Hisao is quite busy.

802
01:08:04,339 --> 01:08:06,467
Yes, with this and that.

803
01:08:06,675 --> 01:08:11,136
He says that smaller companies
just can't make it these days.

804
01:08:11,346 --> 01:08:13,838
But Father is against a merger.

805
01:08:14,049 --> 01:08:15,711
It must be difficult.

806
01:08:16,151 --> 01:08:19,883
Okaden was in a similar situation.
I'm sure we'll follow suit eventually.

807
01:08:20,089 --> 01:08:23,150
It's hard to beat big companies.

808
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:31,424
He wants to hold off while Father is still
healthy, but who knows what will happen.

809
01:08:36,472 --> 01:08:39,840
That was fun.
Great exercise.

810
01:08:40,375 --> 01:08:43,834
It's good to see you so energized.

811
01:08:44,046 --> 01:08:47,676
Yes, I had everybody terribly worried.

812
01:08:47,883 --> 01:08:50,114
But I'm fine now.

813
01:08:50,886 --> 01:08:52,354
See?

814
01:08:54,056 --> 01:08:55,581
Father.

815
01:08:55,791 --> 01:08:56,884
What is it?

816
01:08:57,192 --> 01:08:59,388
I wanted to apologize.

817
01:08:59,595 --> 01:09:04,124
- About what?
- I was being very hard on you.

818
01:09:04,333 --> 01:09:07,303
Don't worry about it.

819
01:09:07,536 --> 01:09:08,629
I'm used to it.

820
01:09:08,937 --> 01:09:10,872
Don't say that.

821
01:09:11,073 --> 01:09:15,306
I would have been
devastated if you had died.

822
01:09:16,445 --> 01:09:19,313
Don't be silly.
I won't die so easily.

823
01:09:19,515 --> 01:09:25,045
I have too many things to think about,
including Akiko and Noriko's situation.

824
01:09:25,254 --> 01:09:27,450
I'm sorry...

825
01:09:27,656 --> 01:09:28,988
...to have worried you.

826
01:09:29,191 --> 01:09:32,286
Still undecided, eh?

827
01:09:33,061 --> 01:09:35,155
Oh, can you sew this?

828
01:09:47,242 --> 01:09:48,870
Are you tired, Grandpa?

829
01:09:49,077 --> 01:09:52,275
- Not at all.
- Then let's play hide-and-seek!

830
01:09:52,481 --> 01:09:53,540
Hide-and-seek, eh?

831
01:09:53,749 --> 01:09:56,116
- Okay, wait one minute.
- Oh, hurry up.

832
01:09:56,318 --> 01:09:57,308
One second.

833
01:09:57,519 --> 01:09:59,613
Hurry!

834
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:03,625
<i>Hurry!</i>

835
01:10:10,866 --> 01:10:12,664
Am I intruding?

836
01:10:16,338 --> 01:10:18,136
What are you doing?

837
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:20,031
Writing a letter.

838
01:10:20,375 --> 01:10:21,343
To whom?

839
01:10:23,412 --> 01:10:24,710
I can't say.

840
01:10:33,055 --> 01:10:34,546
I know.

841
01:10:34,756 --> 01:10:36,054
What?

842
01:10:36,258 --> 01:10:38,056
To whom you're sending it.

843
01:10:38,861 --> 01:10:40,887
It's to the man who eats a lot.

844
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:43,128
No, no.

845
01:10:43,632 --> 01:10:46,124
How are things going with him?

846
01:10:46,335 --> 01:10:49,897
Nothing new.
I'm supposed to give him a response.

847
01:10:50,539 --> 01:10:52,337
What do you think?

848
01:10:53,976 --> 01:10:56,036
I don't have a single reason
to decline.

849
01:10:56,645 --> 01:10:58,170
Then you should just do it.

850
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:01,682
That's easy for you to say.

851
01:11:02,017 --> 01:11:05,647
Why? He seemed like a nice person.

852
01:11:06,121 --> 01:11:12,254
If I did marry him, I know that
everyone would be relieved.

853
01:11:12,461 --> 01:11:14,054
But I can't.

854
01:11:14,930 --> 01:11:18,025
You're in love with someone, aren't you?

855
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:25,700
Yes, you are. I knew it.

856
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:33,576
Who is he?

857
01:11:36,885 --> 01:11:38,854
What is he like?

858
01:11:39,688 --> 01:11:44,217
Remember when I went skiing at
Mount Ibuki with Takako and the others?

859
01:11:44,426 --> 01:11:46,520
Is that the one?

860
01:11:46,728 --> 01:11:50,062
I think I met him
at the Hankyu department store. Right?

861
01:11:51,867 --> 01:11:53,995
That's him, isn't it?

862
01:11:55,604 --> 01:11:57,300
Have you been meeting with him?

863
01:11:59,308 --> 01:12:00,537
No, he lives in Sapporo.

864
01:12:00,742 --> 01:12:04,440
Sapporo?
That's quite far.

865
01:12:04,746 --> 01:12:07,978
So that letter is for him?

866
01:12:08,216 --> 01:12:09,616
I'm just replying.

867
01:12:09,818 --> 01:12:11,912
Oh, sure, sure.

868
01:12:14,957 --> 01:12:16,448
Just a reply.

869
01:12:17,993 --> 01:12:22,260
I don't know how Father
and the others feel...

870
01:12:22,464 --> 01:12:25,593
...but the important thing
is to marry without regret.

871
01:12:25,801 --> 01:12:28,100
You're the one who has to live with it.

872
01:12:29,204 --> 01:12:31,503
That's what I think too.

873
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,474
Anyone would find it
to be a difficult decision.

874
01:12:36,078 --> 01:12:37,944
Is that including you?

875
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:41,579
I was happy. I had no regrets.

876
01:12:41,783 --> 01:12:46,778
Despite all the worrying everyone does
on my behalf, I'm still quite happy.

877
01:12:47,189 --> 01:12:50,591
So are you planning
on staying single forever?

878
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:53,390
I'm still considering...

879
01:12:53,595 --> 01:12:56,793
...whether or not I can maintain this life.

880
01:13:07,373 --> 01:13:08,534
Grandpa, you're it!

881
01:13:08,741 --> 01:13:11,472
Oh, no! Again?

882
01:13:12,111 --> 01:13:14,546
I'm pretty tired now.
I think it's time to quit.

883
01:13:14,747 --> 01:13:16,340
Oh, come on!

884
01:13:16,749 --> 01:13:20,413
I just remembered
that I had an errand to run.

885
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:23,180
No, you're it!
Close your eyes!

886
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:27,156
Okay, I give up. This is it though.

887
01:13:28,361 --> 01:13:30,489
You better not peek!

888
01:13:37,036 --> 01:13:39,403
You're peeking!

889
01:13:40,139 --> 01:13:41,732
Okay, okay.

890
01:13:41,941 --> 01:13:43,933
Face that way.

891
01:14:16,909 --> 01:14:18,400
What are you doing?

892
01:14:19,412 --> 01:14:22,143
Hide-and-seek. I'm it.

893
01:14:22,548 --> 01:14:25,279
Are you ready?

894
01:14:51,243 --> 01:14:54,179
Are you ready?

895
01:15:04,623 --> 01:15:07,821
Are you ready?

896
01:15:19,271 --> 01:15:22,173
Are you ready?

897
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:26,602
<i>I'm ready!</i>

898
01:15:31,144 --> 01:15:34,342
<i>Are you ready?</i>

899
01:15:36,322 --> 01:15:39,053
<i>I'm ready!</i>

900
01:15:43,529 --> 01:15:46,124
<i>Are you ready?</i>

901
01:15:46,332 --> 01:15:48,927
<i>I'm ready!</i>

902
01:15:52,071 --> 01:15:54,472
Are you ready?

903
01:15:54,673 --> 01:15:57,074
<i>I'm ready!</i>

904
01:15:57,343 --> 01:15:59,710
Are you ready?

905
01:15:59,912 --> 01:16:01,813
<i>I'm ready!</i>

906
01:16:03,182 --> 01:16:06,084
Are you ready?

907
01:16:06,485 --> 01:16:09,284
I'm ready!

908
01:16:16,328 --> 01:16:18,820
I'm ready!

909
01:16:21,267 --> 01:16:23,566
I'm ready!

910
01:16:32,812 --> 01:16:36,715
I don't know how young people
feel about things these days...

911
01:16:36,916 --> 01:16:42,116
...but I think it's stifling to live
with someone who has no character.

912
01:16:42,321 --> 01:16:44,881
In my case, as an example...

913
01:16:45,091 --> 01:16:49,620
...if a man was a little wild before I
married him, I wouldn't be too bothered...

914
01:16:49,829 --> 01:16:52,924
...but I would never marry
a man who lacks character.

915
01:16:53,132 --> 01:16:55,567
You can alter behavior,
but you can't alter character.

916
01:16:57,403 --> 01:16:59,565
You're right.

917
01:17:05,077 --> 01:17:06,306
What is it?

918
01:17:09,348 --> 01:17:10,372
Where's Grandpa?

919
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,876
I don't know.

920
01:17:12,084 --> 01:17:14,315
You haven't seen him?

921
01:17:15,888 --> 01:17:16,878
What are you doing?

922
01:17:17,089 --> 01:17:19,524
Hide-and-seek.
Grandpa didn't come this way?

923
01:17:19,725 --> 01:17:21,455
Nope.

924
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:24,095
I wonder where he went.
I can't find him anywhere.

925
01:17:24,296 --> 01:17:26,060
Oh, yeah?

926
01:17:26,398 --> 01:17:27,661
Hey!

927
01:17:28,701 --> 01:17:31,796
There's Grandpa!

928
01:18:55,854 --> 01:18:58,119
Well, that's too bad.

929
01:18:58,324 --> 01:19:00,088
Should've bet on the other one.

930
01:19:00,559 --> 01:19:04,655
Yes. I was thinking
that it might be a 3-2 finish.

931
01:19:06,131 --> 01:19:08,760
Well, that's that.

932
01:19:17,443 --> 01:19:19,912
Regret won't get us anywhere.

933
01:19:20,112 --> 01:19:23,480
Shall we go to Osaka to eat?
How does <i>udonsuki</i> sound?

934
01:19:23,682 --> 01:19:26,982
Let's go home to take
a bath and have a drink.

935
01:19:27,186 --> 01:19:29,621
No, no. Let's go to Osaka.

936
01:19:30,589 --> 01:19:32,455
To Osaka!

937
01:20:16,902 --> 01:20:18,666
She's taking forever!

938
01:20:18,871 --> 01:20:20,840
Yes, she is.

939
01:20:21,707 --> 01:20:23,471
Is that all you have to say?

940
01:20:23,676 --> 01:20:25,440
I wonder what happened.

941
01:20:27,246 --> 01:20:28,942
"I wonder what happened."

942
01:20:29,148 --> 01:20:32,050
That's what I want to ask you.

943
01:20:32,918 --> 01:20:34,181
What happened indeed.

944
01:20:35,688 --> 01:20:37,748
I wonder why she's late.

945
01:20:37,956 --> 01:20:40,482
She said that she would try to come.

946
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:44,992
Try? Why didn't you say so earlier?

947
01:20:45,197 --> 01:20:47,223
She said, "I'll try"?

948
01:20:47,433 --> 01:20:51,131
Aren't we being a bit ambiguous?

949
01:20:51,337 --> 01:20:53,329
Don't you think so?

950
01:20:55,341 --> 01:20:57,742
First of all, this is something...

951
01:20:57,943 --> 01:21:00,037
...that you brought upon me, am I right?

952
01:21:00,279 --> 01:21:01,269
That's right.

953
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:04,882
Then why don't you show
some responsibility, huh?

954
01:21:05,884 --> 01:21:09,286
I wish I hadn't met her,
if this was the case.

955
01:21:09,488 --> 01:21:12,686
Why did you introduce us
in the first place?

956
01:21:12,891 --> 01:21:16,623
A man falling in....

957
01:21:18,864 --> 01:21:24,326
A man falling in love with a woman
at first sight is serious stuff, you know?

958
01:21:24,536 --> 01:21:26,334
Am I right?

959
01:21:26,538 --> 01:21:27,665
Well?

960
01:21:27,873 --> 01:21:31,810
Am I talking nonsense here?
Am I wrong?

961
01:21:32,911 --> 01:21:35,073
This stinks.

962
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,908
Let's get a drink somewhere else.

963
01:21:37,316 --> 01:21:38,511
Well, wait....

964
01:21:38,717 --> 01:21:41,687
Let's wait a bit longer.
She said she had the cow painting.

965
01:21:42,755 --> 01:21:46,590
A bit longer?
We've already waited for 2 hours!

966
01:21:46,792 --> 01:21:47,885
Painting be damned.

967
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,852
- Let's go.
- One more drink.

968
01:21:51,063 --> 01:21:55,057
No, no. I'm full of alcohol already.

969
01:21:57,870 --> 01:22:01,136
"I'll try to."
Give me a break.

970
01:22:01,507 --> 01:22:03,772
She's not coming.

971
01:22:04,042 --> 01:22:06,170
This is terrible.

972
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:20,982
Look on the bright side.

973
01:22:21,193 --> 01:22:23,219
It means he's healthy.

974
01:22:23,762 --> 01:22:25,230
I suppose.

975
01:22:25,431 --> 01:22:29,425
I just wish he'd say something
to us before disappearing.

976
01:22:29,802 --> 01:22:31,134
That's true.

977
01:22:31,336 --> 01:22:35,068
He's a merry fellow, that's for sure.

978
01:22:35,274 --> 01:22:39,507
This morning he claimed that
he had knocked on the gates of heaven.

979
01:22:39,711 --> 01:22:41,612
What shall we do with him...?

980
01:22:44,249 --> 01:22:45,774
The phone's ringing.

981
01:22:57,629 --> 01:23:00,121
Hello. Yes, this is she.

982
01:23:04,937 --> 01:23:06,371
What was that?

983
01:23:09,741 --> 01:23:11,334
We'll be right over.

984
01:23:13,645 --> 01:23:15,705
Noriko!

985
01:23:18,183 --> 01:23:19,151
Who was that?

986
01:23:19,351 --> 01:23:22,321
- Father is ill.
- Who called?

987
01:23:22,588 --> 01:23:27,117
The Sasakis in Kyoto. They said to
rush over. It was a young woman's voice.

988
01:23:27,326 --> 01:23:28,350
What could it be?

989
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,928
I'm not sure, but she said
Father had collapsed again.

990
01:23:32,264 --> 01:23:33,926
Sounds serious.

991
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,193
We must go.

992
01:23:36,401 --> 01:23:37,369
Who called?

993
01:23:37,569 --> 01:23:41,336
Father is ill again. Get ready
and head over there with your brother.

994
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:43,634
Let's go.

995
01:24:46,872 --> 01:24:49,364
They're taking so long.

996
01:24:49,908 --> 01:24:53,003
They should be here soon.

997
01:24:53,612 --> 01:24:54,978
You know...

998
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:57,513
...I really lost out today.

999
01:24:57,716 --> 01:24:58,684
How's that?

1000
01:24:58,884 --> 01:25:02,116
My mink stole is gone.

1001
01:25:02,588 --> 01:25:06,787
Had I known, I would have
had him buy it for me sooner.

1002
01:25:07,025 --> 01:25:09,620
I saw a gorgeous one in Kawaramachi.

1003
01:25:10,963 --> 01:25:14,092
Have George buy one for you.

1004
01:25:14,299 --> 01:25:16,029
George can't afford it.

1005
01:25:16,234 --> 01:25:19,466
The best he can do is a purse.

1006
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:23,641
Someone's here.

1007
01:25:26,578 --> 01:25:28,638
Good evening.

1008
01:25:28,847 --> 01:25:31,976
- Hello, Yuri.
- Hello.

1009
01:25:32,184 --> 01:25:33,880
Oh, it's just George.

1010
01:25:34,086 --> 01:25:36,317
It's not George.
Tonight it's Harry.

1011
01:25:36,521 --> 01:25:37,682
I'll see you later.

1012
01:25:37,889 --> 01:25:40,620
Come home early tonight.

1013
01:25:40,826 --> 01:25:44,058
I suppose you promised him
you'd go out.

1014
01:25:44,963 --> 01:25:46,727
I'll be home early.

1015
01:26:07,953 --> 01:26:10,184
Bye, Mother.

1016
01:26:12,124 --> 01:26:13,717
Hello.

1017
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:52,026
What a day it was....

1018
01:26:53,098 --> 01:26:57,399
We shouldn't have gone out today.

1019
01:26:58,603 --> 01:27:02,301
I guess today wasn't
as good a day as you thought it'd be.

1020
01:27:07,846 --> 01:27:10,372
So unfortunate....

1021
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:14,745
And it was so hot.

1022
01:27:20,125 --> 01:27:22,094
Is anybody home?

1023
01:27:22,461 --> 01:27:23,986
Is anybody home?

1024
01:27:42,129 --> 01:27:43,757
Good evening.

1025
01:27:45,599 --> 01:27:47,864
My name is Kohayagawa.

1026
01:27:49,003 --> 01:27:52,269
Please, do come inside.

1027
01:27:53,908 --> 01:27:56,139
How is he doing?

1028
01:27:58,612 --> 01:28:00,513
Please come in.

1029
01:28:45,192 --> 01:28:48,458
It happened so suddenly.

1030
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:51,763
The time was 8:23.

1031
01:28:59,874 --> 01:29:02,844
He looks so peaceful.

1032
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:16,718
I'm not sure what time he came over,
but we went out together.

1033
01:29:16,924 --> 01:29:21,521
He insisted on going to Osaka,
but I managed to convince him otherwise.

1034
01:29:21,729 --> 01:29:26,133
I was washing my hands over there,
and he was sitting over here...

1035
01:29:26,333 --> 01:29:30,498
...and I thought he looked rather ill,
when he suddenly grabbed his chest.

1036
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:32,464
I see.

1037
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:36,140
I had a doctor come right away...

1038
01:29:37,478 --> 01:29:39,743
...but it was too late.

1039
01:29:41,215 --> 01:29:43,081
I see.

1040
01:29:45,553 --> 01:29:48,580
He was in such pain.

1041
01:29:48,956 --> 01:29:50,652
I see.

1042
01:29:51,225 --> 01:29:53,558
Did he have any final words?

1043
01:29:55,162 --> 01:29:58,394
"Is this it? Is this really it?"

1044
01:29:58,632 --> 01:30:00,726
He said that twice.

1045
01:30:05,005 --> 01:30:06,371
I see.

1046
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:09,676
It was so sudden.

1047
01:30:11,178 --> 01:30:14,080
Life is so fragile.

1048
01:31:05,099 --> 01:31:09,594
Do you think there are more
crows than usual today?

1049
01:31:11,739 --> 01:31:13,173
Yes, there are.

1050
01:31:13,374 --> 01:31:14,967
Think someone died?

1051
01:31:15,175 --> 01:31:17,838
Perhaps.

1052
01:31:19,079 --> 01:31:22,516
But there's no smoke coming from
the chimney of the crematorium.

1053
01:31:24,418 --> 01:31:26,751
Yes, you're right.

1054
01:32:10,731 --> 01:32:12,700
Are you tired, Fumiko?

1055
01:32:14,234 --> 01:32:16,635
No, not too tired.

1056
01:32:17,805 --> 01:32:20,138
You have much to deal with
as well, Hisao.

1057
01:32:23,143 --> 01:32:25,112
What is the company going to do?

1058
01:32:25,312 --> 01:32:28,976
I've been thinking it over,
but it just makes my head hurt.

1059
01:32:29,183 --> 01:32:30,913
A merger?

1060
01:32:31,552 --> 01:32:33,817
I think it may be inevitable.

1061
01:32:35,723 --> 01:32:37,919
What can you do...?

1062
01:32:40,227 --> 01:32:42,628
Father was worried about it.

1063
01:32:42,830 --> 01:32:46,358
I think the best thing would be
to merge with a large company...

1064
01:32:46,567 --> 01:32:50,026
...and continue to work under them.

1065
01:32:50,504 --> 01:32:53,474
A salaried man, eh?

1066
01:32:54,174 --> 01:32:56,075
Yes, it's an option.

1067
01:32:56,643 --> 01:32:59,875
Father was always so undependable...

1068
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:03,539
...but it seems
that he was the only thing...

1069
01:33:03,751 --> 01:33:07,085
...keeping the Kohayagawas afloat.

1070
01:33:23,804 --> 01:33:26,330
I feel bad for Hisao.

1071
01:33:27,074 --> 01:33:29,100
I was really hoping...

1072
01:33:29,309 --> 01:33:31,972
...that Father would be with us
until you were married.

1073
01:33:32,646 --> 01:33:36,742
I was up all night
thinking about what to do...

1074
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:41,479
...and I think that I should do
what makes me happy.

1075
01:33:42,422 --> 01:33:44,618
What are you saying?

1076
01:33:45,092 --> 01:33:52,056
With Father dead, I feel like I should marry
the suitor that everyone picked for me.

1077
01:33:53,066 --> 01:33:55,661
But I don't think I could live with that.

1078
01:33:57,971 --> 01:34:02,500
Doing that might be beneficial
to the Kohayagawa household...

1079
01:34:02,709 --> 01:34:08,910
...but I think I'll regret it
if I'm not honest about my feelings.

1080
01:34:09,116 --> 01:34:11,244
It's a hard decision.

1081
01:34:11,451 --> 01:34:14,114
What are you going to do?

1082
01:34:14,788 --> 01:34:15,915
I think....

1083
01:34:16,323 --> 01:34:17,484
Yes?

1084
01:34:18,025 --> 01:34:20,017
I think I should go to Sapporo.

1085
01:34:20,794 --> 01:34:22,524
I see.

1086
01:34:22,729 --> 01:34:26,632
I personally thought
that it would be best to do so.

1087
01:34:26,834 --> 01:34:30,601
Really?

1088
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:37,301
You're young. I want you
to be as happy as possible.

1089
01:34:57,664 --> 01:35:00,327
- Have you checked the calendar?
- Yes.

1090
01:35:00,534 --> 01:35:03,732
Then let's make the funeral
the day after tomorrow. The obituary?

1091
01:35:03,937 --> 01:35:05,565
It'll be in tomorrow's paper.

1092
01:35:05,772 --> 01:35:09,072
I see. So that's done.

1093
01:35:09,276 --> 01:35:11,541
Oh, what about lunch?

1094
01:35:11,745 --> 01:35:14,271
Yes, I called about that too.

1095
01:35:14,481 --> 01:35:15,642
Should we get cars?

1096
01:35:15,849 --> 01:35:19,149
It's across the river,
so we'd have to make a detour.

1097
01:35:19,353 --> 01:35:22,380
It's close enough to walk.
You can accompany them.

1098
01:35:23,657 --> 01:35:24,750
Eight people, right?

1099
01:35:24,958 --> 01:35:26,358
No, it's nine.

1100
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,552
Hey, it's the madam from Nagoya.

1101
01:35:31,498 --> 01:35:34,696
Hello, ma'am.
Right over there, please.

1102
01:35:34,902 --> 01:35:37,201
Thank you.

1103
01:35:43,744 --> 01:35:45,542
Auntie.

1104
01:35:45,746 --> 01:35:47,374
Please....

1105
01:35:49,349 --> 01:35:51,511
This is quite a shock.

1106
01:35:51,718 --> 01:35:54,119
What happened?

1107
01:35:54,321 --> 01:35:55,755
Was it his heart?

1108
01:35:57,090 --> 01:35:59,059
Yes, it was very sudden.

1109
01:35:59,726 --> 01:36:02,855
I suppose it's better than being
bedridden, just wasting away.

1110
01:36:03,196 --> 01:36:04,630
Yes, that's true.

1111
01:36:06,033 --> 01:36:09,197
So he had no final words?

1112
01:36:10,570 --> 01:36:11,560
He said:

1113
01:36:11,772 --> 01:36:16,710
"Is this it? Is this really it?"

1114
01:36:18,645 --> 01:36:19,908
That's all?

1115
01:36:21,848 --> 01:36:24,079
How happy-go-lucky.

1116
01:36:24,284 --> 01:36:28,722
After doing as he pleased for
all those years, that's all he had to say?

1117
01:36:28,922 --> 01:36:31,357
What a silly man.

1118
01:36:31,992 --> 01:36:36,987
I'm sure he wanted to go on like that
forever, but you can't be too greedy.

1119
01:36:37,931 --> 01:36:39,923
Yes, I've heard that before.

1120
01:36:40,834 --> 01:36:42,996
Oh, hello.

1121
01:36:43,837 --> 01:36:45,703
Hello.

1122
01:36:46,039 --> 01:36:50,977
We humans can't come to terms
with death until it's too late.

1123
01:36:51,178 --> 01:36:54,740
Even people like my brother
who did as he pleased.

1124
01:36:54,948 --> 01:36:57,076
On his deathbed,
even Toyotomi Hideyoshi said:

1125
01:36:57,284 --> 01:37:01,312
"It's as if my glorious life
was but a dream within a dream."

1126
01:37:01,521 --> 01:37:03,149
Indeed he did.

1127
01:37:03,824 --> 01:37:05,156
Where's your uncle from Tokyo?

1128
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:08,258
I haven't seen him.

1129
01:37:08,462 --> 01:37:11,455
He must be very busy.

1130
01:37:12,532 --> 01:37:18,836
If this was the case, he should have just
died when we were all gathered earlier.

1131
01:37:19,673 --> 01:37:23,508
He did as he pleased his whole life,
sold the family heirlooms...

1132
01:37:23,744 --> 01:37:28,682
...spent all of his money, and angered me
with his irresponsibility...

1133
01:37:28,882 --> 01:37:33,445
...but he was also quite happy.
It's a rarity these days.

1134
01:37:34,087 --> 01:37:36,647
Not that it matters much...

1135
01:37:36,923 --> 01:37:39,688
...once you're dead.

1136
01:39:36,409 --> 01:39:37,900
Hey, look.

1137
01:39:38,111 --> 01:39:40,307
Somebody did die.

1138
01:39:40,514 --> 01:39:42,073
There's smoke now.

1139
01:39:43,583 --> 01:39:45,950
Indeed there is.

1140
01:40:02,435 --> 01:40:05,769
It's not a big deal if an elderly person
were to have died...

1141
01:40:05,972 --> 01:40:09,374
...but it would be tragic
if it were somebody young.

1142
01:40:09,576 --> 01:40:13,240
Yes, but no matter how many die...

1143
01:40:13,446 --> 01:40:18,180
...new lives will be born
to take their place.

1144
01:40:18,652 --> 01:40:20,780
You're right.

1145
01:40:20,987 --> 01:40:23,286
It's the cycle of life.

1146
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:18,071
It'll be lonely here without you.

1147
01:41:18,511 --> 01:41:20,207
Sister...

1148
01:41:20,413 --> 01:41:23,941
...once I go to Sapporo,
I want you to visit.

1149
01:41:24,150 --> 01:41:25,550
I would like to see you.

1150
01:41:25,752 --> 01:41:28,517
Of course I'll come visit.

1151
01:41:28,722 --> 01:41:30,418
It's so far....

1152
01:41:31,958 --> 01:41:35,554
What are you going to do now?

1153
01:41:36,196 --> 01:41:37,994
Me?

1154
01:41:38,198 --> 01:41:41,293
I'm happy as I am.

1155
01:41:41,501 --> 01:41:47,304
Minoru's still growing up.
I think this would be best for him.

1156
01:41:47,941 --> 01:41:49,910
That sounds like something you'd say.

1157
01:41:51,311 --> 01:41:54,179
I don't know about that.

1158
01:41:55,348 --> 01:41:59,581
Let's catch up.
We shouldn't be too late.
