2
00:00:48,646 --> 00:00:53,650
I don't want any of you newspapermen
trying a hidden camera stunt on me.

3
00:00:53,651 --> 00:00:56,278
This isn't a public exhibition.

4
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:59,198
And you folks who have never seen
anything of this kind before,

5
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,078
remember, no talking.

6
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:06,288
No matter what anybody says or does,
you keep quiet.

7
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:09,008
Even if John Allen himself should
talk to you,

8
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,900
don't dare answer him.

9
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,755
It doesn't seem quite fair no to talk.

10
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:16,175
We ought to try to make his last few
minutes as pleasant as possible.

11
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,300
Oh, shut up!

12
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:20,100
I'm not worried about him.

13
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:23,267
He'll faint dead away
as soon as the show starts.

14
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:26,803
- All set?
- Yes, sir.

15
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:29,197
Well then, we'll start the parade.

16
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:41,000
Why doesn't he want us to answer
John Allen if he talks to us?

17
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:44,708
Why did you come up here anyway?
There ain't gonna be any legs in this show.

18
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:50,679
Well, you see, I'm taking a lot
of sociology courses at college.

19
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,384
So Prof. Summers, he teaches us, you know,

20
00:01:53,385 --> 00:01:55,780
thought it would be a good thing if
one of us could report to the group...

21
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:57,780
...the actual process of an execution.

22
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,809
So he selected me and got me
a pass from the governor.

23
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,910
College boy, huh?

24
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,800
Well, you'll get your belly
full of it up here alright.

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,999
Doctor?

26
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:11,311
You tell me, will you? Why can't
we answer John Allen back?

27
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:14,306
It's because Allen is living
on his nerve now.

28
00:02:14,407 --> 00:02:17,351
If he talks at all it will be
to keep up his courage.

29
00:02:17,452 --> 00:02:19,212
He really doesn't expect an answer.

30
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:21,290
If you gave him one, it would likely
throw him off.

31
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:24,043
And we'd have a devil of a time
with him, hysteria and all that,

32
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,564
fighting to keep out of the chair.

33
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:27,945
I don't know about that. He seemed
pretty cool when I talked to him.

34
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:29,800
- When was that?
- Yesterday.

35
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:31,354
What did he have to say?

36
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:34,455
Does he still persist that we're
burning him at the wrong time?

37
00:02:34,465 --> 00:02:37,000
- Yep.
- There's something in what he says, too.

38
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:38,201
I don't know about that.

39
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:43,800
Look, doctor, when that current's
turned on, how long will it take before...

40
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:47,400
- ...it's all over?
- You mean before I'll pronounce him dead?

41
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:50,000
No, before he actually is dead.

42
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:53,000
Will he pass out as soon
as the current hits him?

43
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:54,001
- No.
- He won't?

44
00:02:54,022 --> 00:02:55,800
I thought it was all over
just like that.

45
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,201
Not with a powerful fellow
like John Allen.

46
00:02:58,398 --> 00:03:00,300
His body will be paralyzed,

47
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:05,389
but his brain will continue to
function for... maybe two seconds.

48
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,158
Gee!

49
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:11,900
Those will be the longest
two seconds he ever lived.

50
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:15,700
Long enough for him to relive
his whole life.

51
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:18,137
He's due now.

52
00:03:27,615 --> 00:03:32,487
...and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die.

53
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:39,200
He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

54
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,838
I know that my redeemer liveth
and that he shall...

55
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:46,761
...and stand at the latter day
upon the earth.

56
00:03:46,762 --> 00:03:50,850
And though after my skin
and bones destroyed...

57
00:04:22,726 --> 00:04:24,694
John!

58
00:04:24,861 --> 00:04:28,680
- John Allen!
- That's me. What is it, big boy?

59
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:32,600
- My drill went dead. Is the plug in?
- Wait, I'll see.

60
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:39,900
Yeah, it's in. What's wrong?

61
00:04:39,932 --> 00:04:42,999
- Got a screwdriver?
- Wait a minute.

62
00:04:53,485 --> 00:04:55,637
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

63
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:57,450
- What time is it?
- Near five.

64
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,150
I don't want to be late quitting.
I ain't giving this outfit no free overtime.

65
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,200
Anyway, not when I have
a heavy date on.

66
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,100
Say, listen, Bud, I don't think I'm gonna
horn in on your party tonight.

67
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:08,794
Getting stuck up all of a sudden,
are you?

68
00:05:08,795 --> 00:05:10,436
Me and Annie ain't good enough
for you anymore.

69
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:13,337
Oh, it ain't that and you know it.
It's only that...

70
00:05:13,967 --> 00:05:16,903
Well, I don't know who the dame is
Annie's gonna bring along for me.

71
00:05:16,904 --> 00:05:20,600
- I ain't so keen about a blind date.
- Ah, she'll be alright.

72
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:24,120
Annie knows you're particular
about dames. She'll get you a good number.

73
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:26,623
Yeah? Well what about that truck horse
she picked out for me last time?

74
00:05:26,624 --> 00:05:29,770
- I gave her the devil for it, didn't I?
- A lot of good it did me.

75
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:31,999
I was stuck with her for
a whole evening.

76
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:35,598
Boy, all that dame wanted to do
was eat. Eat and dance.

77
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:38,010
I felt like I was handling
the rear end of a fire truck.

78
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:41,264
I told Annie that.
She knows better now.

79
00:05:41,265 --> 00:05:44,100
Now you call her up and tell her it's
cold turkey with me for tonight.

80
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:47,571
A can't do that now, John,
Annie's got a dame all set up.

81
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:50,380
Well, what's this one to be like?

82
00:05:50,408 --> 00:05:53,043
I don't know, but she ain't
gonna be no fireman's delight.

83
00:05:53,194 --> 00:05:56,280
This baby's gonna be alright.
She's got class, Annie says.

84
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,077
- Works in a laundry
- Well I hope she's got class.

85
00:06:00,078 --> 00:06:02,830
Hey, listen now, I ain't promised
you no Peggy Joyce.

86
00:06:02,831 --> 00:06:05,882
Oh, that's all right. I ain't
expecting anything much.

87
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,171
After all a laundry is where
you send your dirty clothes.

88
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:11,948
Hey, you know, Bud...

89
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:17,537
Working this way, 20, 25 stories
up in the air, you know...

90
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:19,832
It kinda gives a fellow ideas.

91
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:24,787
You know, you meet a guy
or a girl down there...

92
00:06:24,888 --> 00:06:26,648
...and they think they're hot stuff,
they amount to something.

93
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:28,810
Well, there ain't nothing wrong
in them being that, is there?

94
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:31,213
No, nothing wrong,
nothing like that, but...

95
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:36,492
I don't know... when you get
up here and look down on them...

96
00:06:36,794 --> 00:06:39,871
Well, you get a different slant
on the whole thing.

97
00:06:40,772 --> 00:06:45,735
You know, they only seem like...
like just a crawling bunch of little flies.

98
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:48,488
Look at them, look at them
crawling down there.

99
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:52,000
A banker, and a lawyer,
and a fancy dame.

100
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:54,821
All the rest of them thinking
they're doing big things.

101
00:06:54,922 --> 00:06:57,224
Making speeches, and getting
into the papers and...

102
00:06:57,225 --> 00:06:59,727
cheating and hating each other.

103
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:04,180
I'll betcha God gets a big laugh
out of this old world.

104
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,868
Hey, listen, if you're gonna talk
carelesslike about God,

105
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,696
don't pick out no six-inch
girder to do it on.

106
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:12,741
Don't it ever hit you that way too?

107
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:16,336
Look, John, you and me's been bunking
together for more than two years now,

108
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:19,256
...and I ain't never heard you pull off
anything like this before.

109
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,252
- You got me scared.
- It scares me too sometimes.

110
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:26,593
You're in a bad way.
Better take some aspirins.

111
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:30,245
First thing I know you'll be going sour on me.
You'll be clipping some of them coupons...

112
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,886
...and getting yourself a study
book to carry around.

113
00:07:32,906 --> 00:07:34,808
That mightn't be a bad idea at that.

114
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:37,119
Oh, no, not while you're
bunking with me.

115
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,700
- I ain't gonna live with no lily.
- Well, don't you worry.

116
00:07:40,857 --> 00:07:43,860
The girl I'm gonna fall for
is gonna have real class.

117
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:46,188
I ain't seen no poodle dogs
chasing you.

118
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,217
Yeah, well she's gonna have
an education.

119
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,200
A girl you can learn something from.

120
00:07:51,228 --> 00:07:53,195
Ain't no use in both of
us being dumb.

121
00:07:53,296 --> 00:07:57,083
Hey, what do you want to go bothering
your head about that education bunk for?

122
00:07:57,084 --> 00:08:00,871
Ain't you making 62.50 a week?
Well, what more do you want?

123
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:04,977
A guy told me that $62.50 is more
than what a college professor makes.

124
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:08,762
Do you want to be a college professor, not
have any dough to blow in on a good time?

125
00:08:08,764 --> 00:08:11,674
No, it ain't the money, Bud,
it ain't that. It's only...

126
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:14,151
Gee, I don't know, there's...

127
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,479
There's so much in the world
I don't know.

128
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,200
One thing you sure don't know is
when you're well off.

129
00:08:20,343 --> 00:08:22,200
Yeah, I guess you're right, Bud.

130
00:08:22,353 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't know why I should be wanting
them kind of things.

131
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,800
You know, it's being up here
so close to the sky...

132
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:31,552
...makes a guy think crazy.

133
00:08:31,573 --> 00:08:34,100
You leave the stinking racket
to the guys what gets paid for it.

134
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,142
You know, like college professors.

135
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:40,300
You and me, we ain't got no time to think.
We got work to do.

136
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:43,218
- Oh, you said it.
- There's only one thing we gotta think about.

137
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:47,608
When we get our arms around
a dame, how far can we go?

138
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:53,380
Hello?

139
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,788
Oh, hello.

140
00:08:55,975 --> 00:08:58,900
Yeah, sure.
I did? How much?

141
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,353
Thirty-eight bucks? Oh boy!

142
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:06,216
Yeah, sure!
Where's the payoff?

143
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,400
Don't worry, I'll be there on time.

144
00:09:09,455 --> 00:09:11,818
John! John!

145
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,200
John! John!

146
00:09:15,428 --> 00:09:18,900
Hey John, can you top it? I pulled
a winner, Peach Blossom in the third.

147
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:21,176
- Yeah, how much did you make?
- Thirty-eight bucks.

148
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:23,137
- Gee, not bad.
- Not bad?

149
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:25,400
Thirty-eight bucks without
lifting a finger.

150
00:09:25,401 --> 00:09:28,001
Say, where would I be if I could
pull one like that every day?

151
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,780
You lost over thirty-eight
on the ponies last month alone.

152
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:34,129
Aw, that don't count. The bookie's
paying off in front of Tony's place.

153
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,903
I'll phone the girls to meet us there,
we'll go out and throw the works.

154
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,940
Say, you ain't gonna blow in
the whole 38!

155
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:43,869
I sure am. You don't spend easy
money fast, no more will come to you.

156
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,500
Oh, yeah, but it seems crazy to spend
all that jack on a couple of dumb dames.

157
00:09:48,556 --> 00:09:51,700
I ain't gonna spend it on the dames.
It's on us.

158
00:09:51,753 --> 00:09:54,500
A couple of ties for you
and a silk shirt for me.

159
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,500
I seen a beauty the other day,
I'm gonna get it. Blue silk it was.

160
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:00,701
What's left of the thirty-eight
goes to the girls.

161
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:04,333
Why did I only have two bucks
on that night?

162
00:10:04,434 --> 00:10:07,786
If I'd had 20 smacks on them
I'd have made... let me see...

163
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:10,657
- I got 38 for two, that's er...
- 380.

164
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:14,388
Three-eighty, that's right!
Can you imagine it, three-eighty.

165
00:10:14,436 --> 00:10:16,100
Yeah, you might just as soon
have lost your twenty.

166
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:19,280
Not me, I've hit my stride,
I'm on a lucky streak now.

167
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:22,537
Last time you hit a lucky streak
I had to pay all the room rent.

168
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,533
Oh, what a guy. No wonder
the girls don't like you.

169
00:10:25,634 --> 00:10:28,200
Oh, they like me well enough.

170
00:10:28,302 --> 00:10:31,346
Say, didn't that fire wagon
slobber all over me?

171
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:34,300
That's because you were
feeding her good.

172
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:38,201
If Annie's got you a thin one this time,
I'll bet she won't even give you a tumble.

173
00:10:38,219 --> 00:10:40,631
Yeah, well that will her tough luck.

174
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:44,952
I ain't wasting any time on losing any sleep
over any dame that comes out of a laundry.

175
00:10:47,031 --> 00:10:48,857
You know? You know, John,

176
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:50,958
you oughtn't to razz a dame
you ain't never seen before.

177
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:54,200
After all, she's taking just
as big a chance as you are.

178
00:10:54,658 --> 00:10:57,226
Yeah? Say, now look here.

179
00:10:57,468 --> 00:11:01,230
Any time I take a dame out
she knows what it is to be out.

180
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:04,177
- I satisfy.
- Oh, yeah?

181
00:11:04,268 --> 00:11:09,200
# Oh, boy, I'm lucky G-boy, #
# I'm lucky, this is my lucky day #

182
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:30,854
Boy, 38 bucks and nothing to do but
spend them, and am I gonna spend them.

183
00:11:30,895 --> 00:11:32,863
I betcha that bookie won't
even show up.

184
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,786
Oh, he'll be here, he can't
afford to pull a trick like that.

185
00:11:35,787 --> 00:11:37,664
I've been laying bets
with this guy for months.

186
00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:39,280
Yeah, well, how many times
have you won?

187
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:43,242
Take it from me, John, a guy don't
get rich slaving away for wages.

188
00:11:43,313 --> 00:11:45,047
It's the guys that...

189
00:11:53,498 --> 00:11:56,010
Gee, that's a hot job.

190
00:11:56,211 --> 00:11:57,881
I didn't notice.

191
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:00,813
Aw, lay off of that fly stuff,
you're down on the level now.

192
00:12:00,915 --> 00:12:02,983
You know, I'm sorry I dated
Annie up tonight.

193
00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:05,000
With all the extra coin
coming in I coulda...

194
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:08,698
No, Bud, that stuff is alright
when a guy is on the loose.

195
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:11,293
- But what about you and Annie?
- I ain't married yet, am I?

196
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,162
- You're engaged.
- Don't tie me down yet.

197
00:12:14,163 --> 00:12:17,483
Till the preacher makes me say love,
honor and obey,

198
00:12:17,584 --> 00:12:19,928
I can still have a little fun.

199
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:26,024
Gee, she had a nifty leg.
I shouldn't have let her get away.

200
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:29,000
Hey, Bud!
Hello there!

201
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:31,632
Say, I pulled a fast one
on you this time, didn't I?

202
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:34,550
- Sure did. How Much you got coming to you?
- Thirty-eight smacks is what you said.

203
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:38,989
- That's right, and here it is.
- Come make my hands filthy.

204
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,403
Say, how about something on the nose
of Letonia tomorrow?

205
00:12:41,404 --> 00:12:42,899
Uh-uh, I'm blowing this.

206
00:12:42,904 --> 00:12:46,215
I got a three-horse parlay that looks
like anybody's money. It pays 55 per 10.

207
00:12:46,216 --> 00:12:48,316
- 55, huh?
- And it's a sure thing.

208
00:12:48,355 --> 00:12:51,200
The last time Buddy played a sure
thing I had to pay all the room...

209
00:12:51,201 --> 00:12:52,281
Aw, forget that.

210
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,083
You oughta come in on this thing too, fella.
It's tips like this that make a fella rich.

211
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:57,450
No thanks, I'll save my money
and stay poor.

212
00:12:57,671 --> 00:13:01,074
Alright, it's up to you. This one can't miss,
Bud, I got inside info on it.

213
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:03,259
I know, straight from the
horse himself.

214
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,700
Say, Bud, if I was you, I'd sink
the whole 38 smacks on this streak.

215
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:10,780
- Let me see, 38, that'd pay me...
- 210.

216
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,000
210, that's right, can you
imagine it? 210!

217
00:13:13,023 --> 00:13:14,883
That's a lot of money to make
without lifting a finger.

218
00:13:14,884 --> 00:13:16,600
Yeah, well it's a lot to lose too.

219
00:13:16,624 --> 00:13:19,980
I won't lose, I told you I was hitting
a lucky streak and this is it, I feel it.

220
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,500
- How much will it be, the whole works?
- Yeah.

221
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,800
Well, how about the silk
shirt and my tie?

222
00:13:23,821 --> 00:13:27,200
Tomorrow night I'll buy you a dozen
ties, I'll dress you in ties, I'll...

223
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,835
Say, wait. I just remembered something.

224
00:13:34,936 --> 00:13:37,200
I can't play anything
on the ponies this time.

225
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:39,101
- Well, what's the matter now?
- Nothing, it's just that...

226
00:13:39,102 --> 00:13:41,372
...I got something else I gotta
do with this jack.

227
00:13:41,552 --> 00:13:43,900
Well, what more can you do with it
than make it grow five times?

228
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:46,159
Now, this is how that parlay shapes up.
In the second place...

229
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,040
Nope, no, I ain't gonna play it.

230
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,100
See me tomorrow and maybe I'll lay
something on them then.

231
00:13:50,223 --> 00:13:52,800
Alright, it's up to you.
It's your loss.

232
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:54,201
Don't forget what I told you.

233
00:13:56,027 --> 00:13:59,983
I'm certainly glad you've decided to
quit playing Santa Claus to them bookies.

234
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,400
- Now, if you sock that dough away, you...
- Look, John.

235
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,078
You hang around here till Annie
and the girlfriend get here,

236
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:06,600
and you tell them that, er...

237
00:14:06,623 --> 00:14:09,900
Tell I was here, see, and I, er...
I got took sick kinda suddenlike...

238
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:11,200
...and I had to go home, see?

239
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:13,255
What'll I tell them that for?

240
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:19,643
Oh, no, Bud, I can't do...

241
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:22,014
Well, there goes the 38.

242
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:32,349
- Hi, girls.
- We don't know you.

243
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,227
Oh yes, you do. I'm the guy
who just said hello to you.

244
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:37,856
You got anything special
on for tonight?

245
00:14:37,957 --> 00:14:40,333
Yeah, we were just gonna get
a bite to eat at the Astor.

246
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:44,421
Come off, come off, you got the Astor mixed
up with the Owl Dining Car, ain't you?

247
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:47,326
- The Owl ain't so bad at that.
- You said it.

248
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:50,447
How about letting me sit across from you
and squirt grapefruit in your eye?

249
00:14:50,448 --> 00:14:51,800
Like they do in the movies.

250
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:54,200
- I ain't particular.
- That goes double for me.

251
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:57,300
Now remember, don't try to pull
no Astor stunts on me.

252
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:59,264
I don't come from the Bronx.

253
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,435
A couple of drinks in a speak, dance
and maybe a movie.

254
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:05,550
A little party afterwards.
That's the program for the evening.

255
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:08,390
- Are you on?
- My name's written over everything you said.

256
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,587
- Atta baby.
- Hey!

257
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:13,488
Who's the smiley lieutenant
down there?

258
00:15:15,232 --> 00:15:19,200
He's got a little business to attend
to first then he's going to join us.

259
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,074
I'll be right back.

260
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:27,362
Well, looks like we eat.

261
00:15:27,706 --> 00:15:29,178
Boy, it's all fixed.

262
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,449
Say, Bud, I don't want to go anywhere
with those two tomatoes.

263
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:33,380
Why not?
- I won't be able to shake Annie...

264
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:34,600
...and that other dame.

265
00:15:34,729 --> 00:15:37,780
And I ain't playing no papa to
two girls, I ain't no Turk.

266
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,100
Ah, you can lose them.

267
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:42,521
Look, if you get into a jam with them,
tell them you gotta make a phone call, see?

268
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:45,500
Then step into some corner drugstore,
and while they're waiting outside...

269
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,354
you sneak out the side door, get it?

270
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,200
Hey, what's holding up the party?

271
00:15:50,227 --> 00:15:52,800
Just giving the boyfriend a few tips
on the love racket.

272
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:55,600
If he's that green, what kind
of an evening am I going to have?

273
00:15:55,711 --> 00:15:58,373
- Bud, here she comes now.
- Who?

274
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,374
Annie.

275
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,500
- Look who she's brought with her.
- The firewagon.

276
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:07,500
Say, I thought you told her...
I'm gonna beat it!

277
00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:09,980
Look, John, you can't do that.
What am I going to do with the girls?

278
00:16:10,005 --> 00:16:12,700
Push them off the pier. I ain't gonna
play fireman again tonight.

279
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,600
I'm sorry but the heavy sugar's
coming down the street.

280
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,200
- The party's off.
- It's off?

281
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,127
That's a hot way to treat
a couple of ladies.

282
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:25,400
Well, looks like we don't eat.

283
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:28,650
- Hello, honey.
- Hello, Bud.

284
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:30,751
What's the idea?

285
00:16:30,752 --> 00:16:33,152
- What's the matter with her?
- I thought you said the laundry.

286
00:16:33,153 --> 00:16:36,353
- Listen, she's the best I could do.
- I don't believe you.

287
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:38,254
I think you're trying to put
something over on me again.

288
00:16:38,255 --> 00:16:39,255
Where's the boyfriend?

289
00:16:39,256 --> 00:16:42,150
He ain't here and he ain't never
going to be here.

290
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:43,901
- What's the matter?
- He's sick.

291
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,600
- When did all this happen?
- I'll talk to you later.

292
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:50,451
- Ain't I going to have a boyfriend tonight?
- Not unless you go down to the firehouse.

293
00:16:50,452 --> 00:16:52,100
Firehouse, what for?

294
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:54,000
What's the use of us standing
around chinning?

295
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:56,601
- Ain't we going anyplace?
- Yeah, I feel hungry.

296
00:16:56,602 --> 00:16:58,402
Yeah, we're going someplace.

297
00:16:58,403 --> 00:17:01,800
- We're going down to a drugstore.
- Drugstore? What for?

298
00:17:01,824 --> 00:17:03,904
I gotta make a phone call.

299
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:35,705
- Hey, what's the matter with you?
- Say, where do you think you are, home?

300
00:17:35,706 --> 00:17:38,500
- This is a dance hall, ain't it?
- Sure it's a dance hall, and that's all it is.

301
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:41,601
I got a right to dance and you
gotta dance with me, I paid for it.

302
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,702
You pay to dance with your feet,
not your hands.

303
00:17:43,703 --> 00:17:45,600
I dance my own way, come on.

304
00:17:45,601 --> 00:17:47,201
And I dance my way.

305
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:49,302
Say, what's the matter here?

306
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:53,400
Ask him. He just bought the place.
Paid a dime for it.

307
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:56,000
I paid a dime for you and I want
a nickel change.

308
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:57,300
What's happened, brother?

309
00:17:57,301 --> 00:17:59,171
Oh, I tried to dance with
the girl nice and...

310
00:17:59,172 --> 00:18:00,972
Come on, sure, I'll fix you out.

311
00:18:38,373 --> 00:18:41,373
Alright now, let's forget about it,
Shirley, come on, get in line.

312
00:18:41,374 --> 00:18:42,664
Atta girl.

313
00:18:47,474 --> 00:18:49,174
I want one ticket.

314
00:18:53,075 --> 00:18:54,675
Alright, right this way, brother.

315
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,676
Yes, there are nice girls all over.

316
00:19:00,477 --> 00:19:03,077
Here you are, Shirley, here's a nice
fellow for you. Dance with him.

317
00:19:20,678 --> 00:19:23,778
Say, big boy, you sure are
a swell little hoofer.

318
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:26,179
You ain't so bad yourself.

319
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,999
I'll improve, if only I can get
some practice.

320
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,400
Say, um...

321
00:19:33,501 --> 00:19:37,901
Do you girls have to dance with
everybody who has a ticket?

322
00:19:37,902 --> 00:19:39,152
Why not?

323
00:19:39,153 --> 00:19:43,853
Well, it must be sort of tough letting
every guy paw you.

324
00:19:43,854 --> 00:19:47,500
They don't paw me, not if they know
what's good for them.

325
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:50,901
Yeah, I guess you do learn
to take care of yourself.

326
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,900
Is this your first time up here?

327
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:57,301
Yeah.

328
00:19:58,302 --> 00:20:01,000
I came up here by accident.

329
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,801
A big accident.

330
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,502
What's the gag?

331
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,903
Oh, you wouldn't understand.
It ain't important anyway.

332
00:20:13,404 --> 00:20:18,900
You know... you don't seem like
these other girls.

333
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:21,601
You seem more refined like.

334
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:23,802
Go ahead, where's the rest of it?

335
00:20:23,803 --> 00:20:25,803
- Rest of what?
- The story.

336
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:29,904
I'm different. I don't belong here,
and you're gonna take me out of it.

337
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:32,105
No, I'm not, why should I?

338
00:20:32,806 --> 00:20:34,696
Don't you want to put me
in a show?

339
00:20:34,697 --> 00:20:37,497
Ain't you got a friend that knows
a big producer?

340
00:20:37,498 --> 00:20:41,098
- Not me.
- You're the first guy that ain't then.

341
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:44,899
Say, do they all try to pull
that stuff on you?

342
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,900
All. Except the ones that try the little
apartment on the avenue line.

343
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:51,101
Well, you wouldn't fall for that
sort of thing, would you?

344
00:20:51,102 --> 00:20:53,302
I'm still here, ain't I?

345
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:56,003
Not that I'm going to stay here.

346
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,904
I got ambition. And someday
I'm gonna get them, see?

347
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:01,405
I hope you do.

348
00:21:04,406 --> 00:21:07,206
Well, how about the next one?

349
00:21:07,207 --> 00:21:10,207
- I'm willing.
- Where's your ticket?

350
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,408
Well... I only got one.

351
00:21:12,409 --> 00:21:14,909
Do you know any more Scotch stories?

352
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,010
Come on, let's dance it out anyway
and I'll get a ticket later.

353
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,480
I can't. Gotta have a ticket.

354
00:21:20,481 --> 00:21:23,481
Well, you wait here for me
and I'll go get one.

355
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:27,282
Get a handful of them so's we can
dance a lot together.

356
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:28,683
Huh?

357
00:21:29,384 --> 00:21:31,000
Alright.

358
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:51,101
- How about this one, baby?
- I'm waiting for a guy.

359
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:53,702
Yeah? Since when are you
reserving him?

360
00:21:55,303 --> 00:21:58,103
Oh, alright. You needn't get
sore about it.

361
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,804
Say, where's the blond girl
that was here?

362
00:22:12,805 --> 00:22:15,905
She's out dancing. Dance with me.

363
00:22:15,906 --> 00:22:18,106
No, thanks, I'll wait.

364
00:22:30,707 --> 00:22:32,507
- Hey!
- Fresh guy, huh?

365
00:22:32,508 --> 00:22:34,008
What's the matter here,
what's the matter?

366
00:22:34,009 --> 00:22:36,000
You try that again and I'll
break your neck!

367
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:37,001
More trouble.

368
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:40,280
Just because he paid a dime to dance with
me he thinks that entitles him to privileges.

369
00:22:40,281 --> 00:22:42,600
Oh, who wants any
privileges with you?

370
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:45,600
A dime would be too much for
a bimbo like you!

371
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:49,001
What are you trying to do,
wreck this place?

372
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:51,322
You get your things, Shirley,
and clear out. And stay out.

373
00:22:51,323 --> 00:22:53,663
Now wait a minute. You don't have
to take it out on her.

374
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,624
This is between me and that guy.

375
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,375
Yeah, well I ain't going to argue
with her or with you, see?

376
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,376
Get out of here both of you
before the cops come!

377
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,400
Here, take him in the back room.

378
00:23:01,401 --> 00:23:04,400
Well, what are you all standing around for?
Come on, enjoy yourselves.

379
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:06,901
Everybody dance, music, music!

380
00:23:29,202 --> 00:23:31,802
It was wonderful of you to stick up
for me the way you did.

381
00:23:31,803 --> 00:23:35,103
Oh, that was nothing. That guy
was just aching for a sock.

382
00:23:35,104 --> 00:23:36,804
And he sure got it.

383
00:23:37,105 --> 00:23:41,485
Gee, I never thought anybody would think
enough about me to stand up for me that way.

384
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,586
Oh, I would have done
the same for any girl.

385
00:23:43,587 --> 00:23:46,287
- Oh... I thought...
- What?

386
00:23:47,088 --> 00:23:48,688
Nothing.

387
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:52,189
Say, do you know...
That's what's the trouble with your job.

388
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,440
You know, it makes the guy
think you're...

389
00:23:54,941 --> 00:23:57,041
Well, what he said you were.

390
00:23:57,642 --> 00:24:00,742
You hadn't ought to work
there anymore.

391
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:02,443
I don't.

392
00:24:02,444 --> 00:24:04,944
Gee, and it was my fault
you got canned.

393
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:08,145
Oh, no! Nothing would have happened
if I hadn't slapped him myself.

394
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:11,146
But then I couldn't let him play
around with me that way, could I?

395
00:24:11,147 --> 00:24:15,047
- No, not if you're decent.
- Well, that's one thing I am.

396
00:24:15,048 --> 00:24:18,848
And they work in a tough joint, but everybody
that knows me knows I'm on the level.

397
00:24:18,849 --> 00:24:21,549
Well, that's the only way
for a girl to be.

398
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:27,450
But why, why do you work
in a dump like that?

399
00:24:27,451 --> 00:24:30,100
Because I can make more money
that way than any other business.

400
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:33,901
You see, I got a family
to take care of.

401
00:24:33,902 --> 00:24:36,202
My mother and father, I mean.

402
00:24:36,203 --> 00:24:37,503
Oh.

403
00:24:37,804 --> 00:24:40,004
They're both sick.

404
00:24:40,005 --> 00:24:42,305
I keep them on a farm in Idaho.

405
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:44,556
You're not handing me a line,
are you?

406
00:24:44,557 --> 00:24:46,027
Alright, if that's what you think!

407
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:48,028
No, no, only it sounds like,
you know...

408
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,629
It's the truth, that's all.

409
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:53,630
Yeah... Well, what are you
going to do now?

410
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:55,431
I don't know.

411
00:24:55,432 --> 00:24:57,800
Gee, I get kind of scared when
I think about being all alone...

412
00:24:57,801 --> 00:24:59,541
...in New York without any money.

413
00:25:00,442 --> 00:25:02,000
Yeah.

414
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,501
What do you do for a living?

415
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,602
Oh, I'm a riveter.

416
00:25:06,603 --> 00:25:09,103
That's where you get such
a big muscle, ain't it?

417
00:25:09,104 --> 00:25:10,404
Yeah.

418
00:25:11,405 --> 00:25:13,505
You make good money
at it too, don't you?

419
00:25:13,506 --> 00:25:15,306
Sixty-two fifty per.

420
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:17,457
Boy, you and Rockefeller.

421
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:20,758
Yeah. You know, that's more than
most college professors make.

422
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:24,059
- Or so my buddy says.
- I'll bet he's right.

423
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,100
The fellows that put up these
big steel skyscrapers...

424
00:25:26,101 --> 00:25:28,461
...are more important than any
college professor.

425
00:25:28,462 --> 00:25:30,862
Oh, no, I wouldn't say that.

426
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:33,773
I think education is the biggest
thing in the world.

427
00:25:33,774 --> 00:25:37,000
Not that I'm against education.
I got a good one myself.

428
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:40,301
- You have?
- Yeah, I went a year to high school.

429
00:25:40,302 --> 00:25:43,382
- No kidding.
- I wish I could have stuck it out but...

430
00:25:43,383 --> 00:25:46,583
Like I told you, the folks were sick
and I had to help them.

431
00:25:46,584 --> 00:25:49,084
Yeah, well that sure is tough.

432
00:25:49,785 --> 00:25:52,885
You know, I haven't learned any myself.

433
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:55,286
I wish I had.

434
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:58,166
Do you know what I was
planning on doing?

435
00:25:58,167 --> 00:25:59,800
Before I lost my job, I mean.

436
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:01,481
I got ambition, see?

437
00:26:01,482 --> 00:26:04,982
And I was planning on...
on going to some business college...

438
00:26:04,983 --> 00:26:06,883
...and finishing my education that way.

439
00:26:06,884 --> 00:26:07,884
You were?

440
00:26:07,885 --> 00:26:10,385
Yeah, that's why I was glad
I worked nights.

441
00:26:10,386 --> 00:26:12,200
It gave me the daytime to study.

442
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:15,541
But, gee, now that I'm out of work...

443
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:18,900
Hey, my Buddy's girl, Annie...

444
00:26:18,901 --> 00:26:21,801
See, she works in the paper box factory.

445
00:26:21,802 --> 00:26:24,582
Maybe I could get her to speak
to her boss about taking you on.

446
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,083
Oh, no, that wouldn't give me
time to study.

447
00:26:27,684 --> 00:26:31,984
Never mind. I'll speak to Tony myself.
I'm sure he'll take me on again.

448
00:26:31,985 --> 00:26:33,800
Oh, no, no. Say, that would
give all those fellows...

449
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,600
...a chance to get fresh
with you again.

450
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:37,201
It'll only be for a short time.

451
00:26:37,202 --> 00:26:40,402
It sure is tough on a
pretty girl, ain't it?

452
00:26:40,403 --> 00:26:42,503
Do you really think I'm pretty?

453
00:26:43,804 --> 00:26:47,104
- Why, yeah!
- I'm glad you think so.

454
00:26:48,705 --> 00:26:51,405
It's the first time I ever heard a fellow
say it that I was glad he did.

455
00:26:51,406 --> 00:26:53,806
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

456
00:26:54,707 --> 00:26:58,207
Oh but, I guess at that I won't be
seeing you anymore, will I?

457
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:01,808
Oh, I don't know.
I haven't thought about it.

458
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:03,909
But you want to?

459
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:07,710
Why, yes, I guess so.

460
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:11,111
It'll make it so much easier for me.
At the dance hall, I mean.

461
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:12,412
- Yeah?
- If the fellows knew...

462
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:15,680
...I had a big guy like you looking out for
me, they wouldn't try and get fresh then.

463
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:17,681
Yeah, I bet you they wouldn't, huh?

464
00:27:19,282 --> 00:27:20,880
And then, when I was studying,

465
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:22,971
there'd be lots of times I wouldn't know
what things meant.

466
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:25,172
I won't have anybody to ask.

467
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:30,473
- But if you was around.
- Oh, no, no I couldn't help you that way.

468
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:34,200
You know, I don't know
anything about books.

469
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:37,501
I'll bet you do.
But even if you don't...

470
00:27:37,502 --> 00:27:39,702
...we could study them out together.

471
00:27:39,703 --> 00:27:41,600
That's what we could do.

472
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:44,200
Yeah?

473
00:27:46,002 --> 00:27:48,302
Say, that would be something like.

474
00:27:48,303 --> 00:27:51,303
That's what I'd like awful much to do
if you let me, mister...

475
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:55,500
- John Allen's the name.
- Shirley Day's mine.

476
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:59,101
Well, I'm certainly glad
to meet you, Miss Day.

477
00:27:59,102 --> 00:28:02,302
And I sure am glad to
meet you, Mr. Allen.

478
00:28:03,503 --> 00:28:05,203
Well.

479
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:08,404
Yeah.

480
00:28:08,405 --> 00:28:10,335
She's got you dizzy, that's what.

481
00:28:10,336 --> 00:28:12,636
I thought you had more sense
than fall for the first dame...

482
00:28:12,637 --> 00:28:15,337
...that sighs at you and tells you
how wonderful you are.

483
00:28:15,338 --> 00:28:17,988
Here me and Annie's been chasing
around trying to get you interested...

484
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:21,300
...in some nice little home girl.
But no, this one's too fat,

485
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:23,101
this one worked in a laundry.

486
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:27,880
While we go chasing around trying to find
a Peggy Joyce for you, what do you do?

487
00:28:27,901 --> 00:28:31,101
You go out and get yourself
hard-tied by a dance-hall Jane.

488
00:28:31,102 --> 00:28:34,302
You was the guy that didn't have
no use for women.

489
00:28:34,303 --> 00:28:38,000
They was all flies, and you got such
a big laugh looking down on them.

490
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:41,900
- Yeah, but I get a big kick out of Shirley.
- Ah, you could do better with a mule.

491
00:28:41,901 --> 00:28:44,101
You think I'm stuck on her,
but I ain't.

492
00:28:44,102 --> 00:28:46,502
I got my eyes open,
I know what I'm doing.

493
00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:48,400
But do you know what she's doing?

494
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:49,700
That's what counts.

495
00:28:49,701 --> 00:28:51,380
She ain't after nothing from me.

496
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:54,681
Oh, no, she's sweet, and pure,
and innocent.

497
00:28:54,682 --> 00:28:58,082
- She really is on the level.
- Don't make me laugh.

498
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:00,700
- How much has she got out of you so far?
- Not a red cent.

499
00:29:00,701 --> 00:29:03,980
- Have you offered her any?
- Oh, just before she got her job back,

500
00:29:03,981 --> 00:29:06,081
when she was in a jam,
I offered her a ten-spot.

501
00:29:06,082 --> 00:29:07,682
Yeah, but she wouldn't have it.

502
00:29:07,683 --> 00:29:10,483
She's no dummy!
She can add!

503
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:14,984
Why take a tenner today when
you can get 62.50 every week?

504
00:29:14,985 --> 00:29:18,185
Oh, Bud, the only thing you've got
against her is where she works.

505
00:29:18,786 --> 00:29:21,176
You've got the kid all wrong.
The only reason she works there...

506
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:23,500
...is because she needs a lot
of money to help her folks.

507
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:26,151
So that's the racket, huh?

508
00:29:26,152 --> 00:29:28,352
The mother needs an operation.

509
00:29:28,353 --> 00:29:30,423
The kid brother's gotta have
his eyes treated...

510
00:29:30,424 --> 00:29:31,524
Oh, nothing like it.

511
00:29:31,525 --> 00:29:35,400
I don't doubt she makes a lot of money but
I bet she don't make it all by dancing.

512
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:39,881
Now listen, Bud.

513
00:29:39,882 --> 00:29:42,442
Even when you say that
I don't get sore.

514
00:29:42,443 --> 00:29:45,043
And if I were stuck on her,
I'd get sore, wouldn't I?

515
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:47,700
- I guess.
- But I ain't sore.

516
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:49,999
So don't that prove to you
I know where I'm at?

517
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Why are you hanging around her
so much for then?

518
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:54,201
She's good company, she knows things.

519
00:29:54,202 --> 00:29:56,682
- She goes to school.
- She goes to school!

520
00:29:56,683 --> 00:29:58,999
- Yeah.
- I'll say she's a wise hen.

521
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,060
She's found out you're nuts
about that education stuff...

522
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:02,751
...and she's trying to hook you
with that bait.

523
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,152
Oh, nothing like it. She went to school
long before I ever met her.

524
00:30:06,153 --> 00:30:09,000
Listen, John, that dame don't
need to go to school.

525
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:11,401
- She knows everything.
- Yeah.

526
00:30:11,402 --> 00:30:13,302
Where are you taking her tonight?

527
00:30:13,303 --> 00:30:15,703
She's got the night off,
we're going to the library.

528
00:30:15,704 --> 00:30:17,304
A fellow there's giving a lecture.

529
00:30:19,205 --> 00:30:21,555
- She's going to a lecture with you.
- Yeah.

530
00:30:21,556 --> 00:30:23,556
Boy, this is the tipoff.

531
00:30:23,557 --> 00:30:27,850
When a dancing Jane sits through a lecture
with a guy there's only one answer.

532
00:30:27,901 --> 00:30:29,900
She's got designs on him.

533
00:30:29,901 --> 00:30:32,801
Now look here, don't
you worry about me, Bud.

534
00:30:32,802 --> 00:30:35,002
There ain't a chance of her
roping me in.

535
00:30:35,003 --> 00:30:36,500
That's what a lot of guys have said...

536
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,601
...but I've noticed the marriage license
bureau ain't going out of business.

537
00:30:39,602 --> 00:30:41,802
Yeah, well it ain't gonna get
any of my trade.

538
00:30:41,803 --> 00:30:43,103
Not yet anyway.

539
00:30:43,104 --> 00:30:47,304
I'm wise to Shirley. I know she'd
like to tie one on me.

540
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:49,605
Why not? I'm a good buy.

541
00:30:49,606 --> 00:30:52,706
Yeah, but I'm just a little bit
too smart for her.

542
00:30:52,707 --> 00:30:55,307
Alright, John, but remember this.

543
00:30:55,308 --> 00:30:59,999
When it comes around to playing with a dame
or pounding on a stick of dynamite,

544
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,800
the real smart guy chooses
the dynamite.

545
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:04,501
Okay!

546
00:31:04,502 --> 00:31:09,999
Now, if you're a good boy, when Papa comes
home he'll bring you a nice big lollipop.

547
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,800
- Make it a red one.
- Right.

548
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:14,401
Come home sober.

549
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:31,400
# Gave you my love #
# Gave you my kisses #

550
00:31:31,401 --> 00:31:35,001
# Now that it's over I see #

551
00:31:35,002 --> 00:31:39,000
# You knew you hurt somebody #

552
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:42,601
# But why did it have to be me #

553
00:31:42,602 --> 00:31:46,902
# You took my love #
# Played with my kisses #

554
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:50,203
# Somehow it never could be #

555
00:31:50,204 --> 00:31:54,204
# You knew you hurt somebody #

556
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:57,905
# But why did it have to be me #

557
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,806
# Oh, didn't you know #

558
00:32:00,807 --> 00:32:05,500
# Didn't I show I cared #

559
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:08,507
# Oh, loving you so #

560
00:32:08,508 --> 00:32:13,208
# Couldn't my heart be spared #

561
00:32:13,209 --> 00:32:15,909
# Heaven above... #

562
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,210
I told you I didn't want
to come here.

563
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:21,700
I wanted to go to that lecture.

564
00:32:21,712 --> 00:32:25,512
There's plenty of time to go there, honey.
We can take in the second show.

565
00:32:25,513 --> 00:32:28,913
No, there ain't no second show
in a lecture.

566
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:31,374
Well, it can't be very good they
if they don't run it twice.

567
00:32:32,975 --> 00:32:37,075
- Aw, come on, let's have another drink.
- No, no, no.

568
00:32:38,076 --> 00:32:40,300
If it's the money that's
worrying you, I'll pay for it.

569
00:32:40,301 --> 00:32:42,401
No, it' ain't the money and you know it.

570
00:32:46,002 --> 00:32:49,302
I just don't like the stuff
they serve here.

571
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:51,900
There's going to be another
act in a little while.

572
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:54,801
- Let's stay and see that.
- No, it ain't gonna be any good.

573
00:32:56,402 --> 00:32:59,202
Nobody's any good in here.

574
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,803
They're just flies.

575
00:33:02,804 --> 00:33:06,904
- I want another drink.
- Say, you've had enough already.

576
00:33:08,305 --> 00:33:11,605
A girl like you oughtn't to drink
all the stuff you do.

577
00:33:11,606 --> 00:33:14,406
I have to. It makes me
forget my troubles.

578
00:33:15,707 --> 00:33:18,000
What troubles have you got?

579
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:20,441
Oh, John, if you only knew how
I've had to suffer in that dance hall,

580
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:21,870
you'd take me out of it.

581
00:33:21,871 --> 00:33:24,400
Why should I take you out of it?

582
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:31,100
What troubles have you
got there anyway?

583
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:35,901
- Who makes you trouble?
- The girls. They're so jealous.

584
00:33:35,902 --> 00:33:40,102
And the boss, Tony. I'm beginning to be
afraid of him, John.

585
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:42,303
What's the matter with him?

586
00:33:42,304 --> 00:33:44,404
I don't like the way he looks at me.

587
00:33:45,905 --> 00:33:48,405
What way does he look at you?

588
00:33:48,406 --> 00:33:50,606
Oh... you know.

589
00:33:52,007 --> 00:33:53,307
Ahh!

590
00:33:53,308 --> 00:33:56,008
Hey there! Another cup of tea.

591
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:58,409
- And bring the bottle this time.
- Yes, ma'am.

592
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:01,110
No more for me.

593
00:34:17,411 --> 00:34:19,811
Leave the bottle, I said!

594
00:34:24,512 --> 00:34:26,712
Come on, come on, let's go to
that lecture.

595
00:34:26,713 --> 00:34:30,253
- Not yet, honey.
- But you said you would.

596
00:34:30,254 --> 00:34:32,254
I wanna see the manager first.

597
00:34:32,255 --> 00:34:34,655
- What for?
- To see if he won't take me on.

598
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:39,756
You don't want to take a job
dancing here like that, would you?

599
00:34:39,757 --> 00:34:42,000
Half undressed.

600
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:44,101
Wouldn't you want me to?

601
00:34:44,902 --> 00:34:47,602
What difference would it make to me?

602
00:34:47,603 --> 00:34:50,000
Wouldn't it make just a little
bit of difference?

603
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:53,101
Now look here, Shirley.

604
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:56,502
- I like you a whole lot, see?
- Yeah?

605
00:34:57,203 --> 00:34:59,203
And that's all.

606
00:34:59,204 --> 00:35:01,504
That's as far as it goes.

607
00:35:01,505 --> 00:35:03,205
Oh, John!

608
00:35:04,706 --> 00:35:07,800
Oh, come on, don't start that again.

609
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:11,000
I can't stand it, not when I'm drunk.

610
00:35:13,401 --> 00:35:14,701
You know...

611
00:35:15,902 --> 00:35:18,202
I think I'm a little drunk.

612
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:21,683
Oh, John, be nice to me.

613
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:25,184
- I'm so lonely.
- Alright, alright, I'll be nice.

614
00:35:25,185 --> 00:35:27,585
Oh, John!

615
00:35:30,786 --> 00:35:33,586
Hey... you know, I like that.

616
00:35:33,587 --> 00:35:38,387
- Wouldn't you like to have more?
- That ain't a bad idea.

617
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:44,988
No... I don't want any more.

618
00:35:46,189 --> 00:35:48,289
I don't want anything.

619
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,190
Now look here, Shirley.

620
00:35:53,091 --> 00:35:57,591
You're a good kid, see, a good kid.

621
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:02,000
But you ain't for me.

622
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:04,001
That's a nice thing to say.

623
00:36:04,002 --> 00:36:06,902
Alright, it doesn't matter.

624
00:36:07,903 --> 00:36:09,703
I know you don't care
a rap about me.

625
00:36:09,704 --> 00:36:13,000
Sure I do, Shirley, I care
about you a whole lot.

626
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:16,200
- I said I did.
- You never kissed me.

627
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:19,601
I did. Just a while ago.

628
00:36:19,602 --> 00:36:22,332
I don't mean like that.
I mean kissing me because you must do it!

629
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,888
Because you can't keep yourself back.

630
00:36:23,889 --> 00:36:26,500
Because your whole inside
burns up just for me.

631
00:36:26,501 --> 00:36:30,201
- Oh, shush...
- That's how I am for you.

632
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:36,302
- Shirley...
- Yes, John?

633
00:36:36,303 --> 00:36:38,203
I know what you mean.

634
00:36:39,004 --> 00:36:41,804
Yeah, that's how I want you now.

635
00:36:41,805 --> 00:36:45,200
- No, John, you don't love me.
- Yes, I do. I do, Shirley.

636
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:02,901
Will you have this woman to be
your wedded wife,

637
00:37:02,902 --> 00:37:05,102
to live together in lawful state
of matrimony...

638
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:10,153
will you love her, comfort her, honor
and keep her in sickness and in health,

639
00:37:10,154 --> 00:37:15,254
and, forsaking all others, keep only
unto her as long as you both shall live?

640
00:37:15,255 --> 00:37:17,055
Say "I will", John.

641
00:37:17,056 --> 00:37:19,656
I'll say anything you want me to.

642
00:37:19,657 --> 00:37:22,557
- Only I got to have you.
- John!

643
00:37:22,558 --> 00:37:26,100
I want another drink.
Hey, waiter!

644
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:29,000
I'm afraid he's too drunk for me
to go on with the ceremony.

645
00:37:29,001 --> 00:37:31,301
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
- Yes, he does.

646
00:37:31,302 --> 00:37:34,302
- Come on, John, say "I will"!.
- Say, where's my drink?

647
00:37:34,303 --> 00:37:37,203
Say, what sort of service...
Hey, waiter!

648
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:40,104
Never mind him. There's ten bucks
in this for you.

649
00:37:40,105 --> 00:37:42,505
That ought to take place of the
two words he's gotta say.

650
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,456
Will you have this man to be
your wedded husband,

651
00:37:49,457 --> 00:37:51,657
to live together in the lawful state
of matrimony...

652
00:37:51,658 --> 00:37:56,658
will you love him, comfort him, honor
and keep him in sickness and in health,

653
00:37:56,659 --> 00:38:01,359
and, forsaking all others, keep only
unto him as long as you both shall live?

654
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,860
I will.

655
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:04,561
Got a ring?

656
00:38:04,862 --> 00:38:06,562
Here it is.

657
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:10,363
- Hm, all prepared, hm?
- For three weeks.

658
00:38:10,364 --> 00:38:12,674
With this ring I do thee wed.

659
00:38:12,675 --> 00:38:15,175
With all my worldly goods I do thee endow.

660
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:17,176
Come on, John, put this on me.

661
00:38:17,177 --> 00:38:18,977
What for?

662
00:38:18,978 --> 00:38:20,558
Now look here.

663
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:23,159
If you ain't going to that lecture,

664
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,260
come on, let's dance.

665
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,661
That music's getting me.

666
00:38:27,662 --> 00:38:29,862
There ain't no music here, John,
what's the matter with you?

667
00:38:29,863 --> 00:38:32,163
Sure there is, can't you hear it?

668
00:38:32,764 --> 00:38:35,664
Say, what are you trying to do,
make me out drunk?

669
00:38:39,265 --> 00:38:42,900
- What's he doing here?
- Never mind, I'll put it on myself.

670
00:38:44,101 --> 00:38:46,601
- There.
- Congratulations.

671
00:38:46,602 --> 00:38:50,102
- Now, John, you may kiss her.
- Kiss who?

672
00:38:51,503 --> 00:38:53,503
Oh... Shirley?

673
00:38:54,204 --> 00:38:56,504
You bet I'll kiss her.

674
00:38:56,505 --> 00:39:03,000
I'll kiss her and there won't be anything
left to her, only my kisses.

675
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:07,881
Let go of me, John, we'll fall.

676
00:39:07,882 --> 00:39:12,442
Not a chance. I've got you now
and I'm gonna hold on to you.

677
00:39:12,443 --> 00:39:15,343
Not a chance.

678
00:39:15,344 --> 00:39:18,644
Not a chance...
Over here, here we go.

679
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:24,500
Hello, Bud!
Hey, look what I brought home.

680
00:39:24,501 --> 00:39:27,301
- That's Shirley.
- What's the idea?

681
00:39:27,302 --> 00:39:29,982
You shouldn't have brought her up here,
John. You know the landlady don't...

682
00:39:29,983 --> 00:39:32,683
Oh, she'll let this girl in alright.

683
00:39:32,684 --> 00:39:36,884
- That's my friend, Shirley.
- So that's your game, huh?

684
00:39:36,885 --> 00:39:39,200
Gonna get him in a jam
so's he'll have to marry you.

685
00:39:39,201 --> 00:39:42,400
Oh, no, no... I ain't gonna marry her.

686
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:45,101
I ain't gonna marry anybody.

687
00:39:45,102 --> 00:39:48,802
No, sir.
Hey, look here, Bud.

688
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,703
You better clear out of here, see?

689
00:39:51,704 --> 00:39:56,304
You can't stay here with us.
It wouldn't be respectable.

690
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:04,305
Yeah! I'll get out.

691
00:40:05,406 --> 00:40:07,986
I ain't gonna let you pull your
old army game in him.

692
00:40:07,987 --> 00:40:10,887
- Who's pulling the army game?
- You are and you know it.

693
00:40:10,888 --> 00:40:14,090
You got him drunk so's he'd get all hot over
you and now you're framing him to marry you.

694
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:17,081
I don't have to frame anything,
Mr. Wise-guy.

695
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,082
We're married already.

696
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,683
You're what?

697
00:40:22,084 --> 00:40:24,784
- John! John!
- What's the matter now?

698
00:40:24,785 --> 00:40:26,800
Did you let this dirty little egg
rope you in?

699
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:28,801
Hey, that's no way to talk
about his wife!

700
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:32,402
- You filthy little rat you!
- What's the matter now?

701
00:40:32,403 --> 00:40:36,903
I can't stay here any longer.
I gotta take her to that lecture.

702
00:40:36,904 --> 00:40:39,704
- Come on, John.
- That's all I'm gonna do.

703
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:43,705
There ain't a chance she's
taking me for a ride.

704
00:40:43,706 --> 00:40:48,106
- I'm just a little bit too smart for her.
- Take it easy now, will you?

705
00:40:50,507 --> 00:40:52,437
I ain't gonna let you get
away with this.

706
00:40:52,438 --> 00:40:55,600
Oh, what are you sore about anyway?
I ain't taking nothing away from you.

707
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:58,090
He ain't the kind of man you're
used to playing around with.

708
00:40:58,091 --> 00:41:00,051
- He's s square shooter.
- Well, ain't I?

709
00:41:00,052 --> 00:41:03,152
Yeah, I know your kind.
And so do lots of other guys I'll bet.

710
00:41:03,153 --> 00:41:05,853
Only they was all too smart to let you
ring the wedding bells on them.

711
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:10,100
But this poor guy. Didn't take you long
to find out he couldn't hold his liquor.

712
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:11,201
Say listen, brother.

713
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,702
Until you can talk the signature
off of this...

714
00:41:13,703 --> 00:41:16,700
you're only wasting your breath
making nasty cracks about me.

715
00:41:16,701 --> 00:41:18,999
Hm, you got a license and everything, eh?

716
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,200
How much did you have to pay extra to
get this at night? And got him drunk, too.

717
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:25,100
He wasn't drunk when I got it,
he was perfectly sober.

718
00:41:25,101 --> 00:41:28,301
But he wanted to celebrate our wedding.
That's how he got tanked up.

719
00:41:28,302 --> 00:41:29,902
I don't believe you.

720
00:41:29,903 --> 00:41:31,803
I notice you ain't let up none.

721
00:41:31,804 --> 00:41:35,280
No, you had to keep your head clear so
you could steer him into this, didn't you?

722
00:41:35,281 --> 00:41:38,000
He's a little white angel, ain't he?
It's me that's all bad, eh?

723
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:40,751
The worst thing you ever did
was getting born.

724
00:41:40,752 --> 00:41:42,020
It's a good thing he's passed out.

725
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:43,800
If he was sober, you wouldn't
dare insult me like this.

726
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,901
If he was sober you wouldn't
be here like this!

727
00:41:46,802 --> 00:41:49,332
Oh, it's all over, ain't it?

728
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:51,463
I'll be good to him, honest I will.

729
00:41:51,464 --> 00:41:54,064
- He won't ever be sorry he married me.
- No.

730
00:41:55,365 --> 00:41:58,665
Come on, let's you and me
be friends too.

731
00:41:58,666 --> 00:41:59,999
Not me!

732
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,900
If he had taken you because
he wanted to, I wouldn't interfere.

733
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:05,980
Since you put this over on him with
your cheap dirty tricks,

734
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,000
I ain't gonna let you get away with it?

735
00:42:07,001 --> 00:42:09,601
Alright then, you've had your say
now listen to mine!

736
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:12,900
He's married to me, right,
square and legal.

737
00:42:12,901 --> 00:42:15,201
And since I'm his wife and partner
to all that's his,

738
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:17,402
you just get out of here, see?

739
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,403
My husband's waiting for me.

740
00:42:21,404 --> 00:42:23,604
And I ain't gonna keep him waiting.

741
00:42:33,305 --> 00:42:36,300
Alright, I'll get out.

742
00:42:36,301 --> 00:42:38,001
But get this.

743
00:42:38,002 --> 00:42:40,602
I'll make you sorry for what
you've done to him.

744
00:42:47,503 --> 00:42:51,000
You said you'd bring me home
a lollipop, big boy.

745
00:42:51,701 --> 00:42:55,600
And you did alright.
And a red one at that.

746
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,601
Welcome home, Shirley.

747
00:43:32,202 --> 00:43:33,902
Cigarette?

748
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,703
Oh, Bud, how long are you
gonna keep sore at me?

749
00:43:37,904 --> 00:43:39,184
- I ain't sore at you.
- Yes, you are.

750
00:43:39,185 --> 00:43:40,600
You've been this way ever
since the night I...

751
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:42,701
- Do you blame me?
- Well, it's my funeral ain't it?

752
00:43:42,702 --> 00:43:44,002
Only because you won't
listen to me.

753
00:43:44,003 --> 00:43:46,803
I can't, I gotta play square.
After all I married her.

754
00:43:46,804 --> 00:43:49,904
Yeah, when you were so cockeyed drunk
you didn't know what you was doing.

755
00:43:49,905 --> 00:43:53,145
Well, whether I was drunk or sober I'm
married to her now, see, and I gotta stick.

756
00:43:53,146 --> 00:43:55,006
No, you ain't. I ain't gonna let you.

757
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,407
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're too good to be tied to her.

758
00:43:57,408 --> 00:43:59,508
- Maybe I wanna be.
- Oh, no you don't.

759
00:43:59,509 --> 00:44:03,209
It's only because you're so fine that
you don't want to do anything to hurt her.

760
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:06,410
But I ain't fine, see?
And I ain't afraid to hurt her.

761
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:09,311
I can't walk out on her if that's what
you're after. It wouldn't be fair.

762
00:44:09,312 --> 00:44:11,712
I know her kind. She's a softy.

763
00:44:11,713 --> 00:44:13,353
She got tired of grubbing
for her own keep,

764
00:44:13,354 --> 00:44:16,154
you look like three squares and
flop to her so she hooked you.

765
00:44:16,155 --> 00:44:17,700
I don't think so.

766
00:44:17,701 --> 00:44:19,700
You've only been married
to her three weeks.

767
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:21,901
Where's all that dough
you had in the bank?

768
00:44:21,902 --> 00:44:23,600
On her back already, ain't it?

769
00:44:23,601 --> 00:44:24,881
She had to have decent clothes.

770
00:44:24,882 --> 00:44:28,182
A riveter's wife don't need
silk lingerie and silk pajamas.

771
00:44:28,183 --> 00:44:30,383
Not a night gown, mind you, pajamas!

772
00:44:30,384 --> 00:44:31,984
That shows you what she's like.

773
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:36,285
- More rivets!
- You'll have to wait a minute.

774
00:44:36,286 --> 00:44:41,056
Oh, Bud! Why are you so
bitter against her?

775
00:44:41,057 --> 00:44:43,200
Because I... Well...

776
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:46,100
You're the kind of guy I wished
I could have been myself.

777
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:48,671
That's why I'm so broke up about
this tramp getting you.

778
00:44:48,672 --> 00:44:49,672
Don't call her that.

779
00:44:49,673 --> 00:44:51,873
That's all she is. Don't you think
I know the breed?

780
00:44:51,874 --> 00:44:53,644
She lied to you about her
parents, didn't she?

781
00:44:53,645 --> 00:44:55,800
Said they was out on a farm in Idaho.

782
00:44:55,801 --> 00:44:58,501
All the time they was living in
a booze joint on 10th Ave.

783
00:44:58,502 --> 00:45:01,702
Yeah, I don't know why she lied
to me about them.

784
00:45:01,703 --> 00:45:04,000
I do. She's lied to you about
other things.

785
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,301
And she'll keep on lying to you
the rest of her life.

786
00:45:06,302 --> 00:45:07,600
She was born crooked.

787
00:45:07,601 --> 00:45:09,371
It ain't in her nature to play
square with a man.

788
00:45:09,372 --> 00:45:13,100
Don't say that! She's on the level
that way, with men I mean.

789
00:45:13,101 --> 00:45:14,600
- I know she is.
- Yeah?

790
00:45:14,601 --> 00:45:17,700
Where'd she get all them glad rags
she was dolled up in when she come to you?

791
00:45:17,701 --> 00:45:21,401
From dancing?
She only made 5c a dance.

792
00:45:21,402 --> 00:45:24,000
There's a limit to how much you can make
adding up pennies in a night.

793
00:45:24,001 --> 00:45:27,900
She wouldn't have made enough to buy them
clothes not even if she was a merry-go-round.

794
00:45:27,901 --> 00:45:30,051
- She's worked hard.
- Sure she has.

795
00:45:30,052 --> 00:45:31,900
And I'll tell you where she did it too.

796
00:45:31,901 --> 00:45:34,201
The same place she still goes
every afternoon.

797
00:45:34,202 --> 00:45:36,602
- She goes to the movies.
- Yeah?

798
00:45:36,603 --> 00:45:39,480
Now look here, Bud. There's a limit
to what I'll stand for.

799
00:45:39,481 --> 00:45:42,331
- You'll stand for all I've got to give you.
- No I won't!

800
00:45:42,332 --> 00:45:45,232
What she's done before
we got married that's out, see?

801
00:45:45,233 --> 00:45:47,400
You and me haven't been
holiness ourselves.

802
00:45:47,401 --> 00:45:51,080
She's my wife now, and you and everybody
else has got to respect her.

803
00:45:51,091 --> 00:45:53,351
- Your wife? Tony's wife!
- Don't say that.

804
00:45:53,352 --> 00:45:56,002
Yes, his wife. Anybody else's wife that
wanted. I could have had her myself!

805
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,500
Shut up you!

806
00:45:57,501 --> 00:45:58,801
Bud!

807
00:45:58,902 --> 00:46:00,402
Bud!

808
00:46:00,503 --> 00:46:01,803
Bud!

809
00:46:02,604 --> 00:46:04,204
Bud!

810
00:46:16,205 --> 00:46:19,200
- You gonna play that all day long?
- Why not?

811
00:46:19,201 --> 00:46:21,541
It's the only fun I can get
around here.

812
00:46:21,542 --> 00:46:23,642
You ain't no happiness boy
these days.

813
00:46:24,443 --> 00:46:27,200
You don't like me to play it
just because it was his.

814
00:46:27,801 --> 00:46:29,901
Oh, alright!

815
00:46:30,002 --> 00:46:33,222
How long are you gonna
keep on being like this?

816
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:35,700
Makes me sick to look at you.

817
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:37,400
Why don't you go out
and get yourself a job?

818
00:46:37,701 --> 00:46:42,000
- I can't get one. I've tried.
- You can go back to riveting.

819
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:44,002
You know the boss would take
you on again as soon as you got better.

820
00:46:44,003 --> 00:46:46,200
No, I can't go back to that.

821
00:46:46,501 --> 00:46:48,201
Not ever since Bud...

822
00:46:48,902 --> 00:46:51,002
I can't climb.

823
00:46:51,703 --> 00:46:55,103
When I get up there...
my had swims.

824
00:46:55,704 --> 00:46:57,504
I get sick, afraid.

825
00:46:57,505 --> 00:46:59,999
- I gotta hold on.
- Oh, rats!

826
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,600
One minute he was standing
there talking to me.

827
00:47:02,601 --> 00:47:06,001
And the next he... he was flying
through space.

828
00:47:06,002 --> 00:47:10,202
His fingers clawing, trying to catch hold
of something and nothing for him to grab.

829
00:47:10,803 --> 00:47:12,603
And then when he hit...

830
00:47:12,604 --> 00:47:15,604
I see, well it's going to be up to me
to go back to work.

831
00:47:15,605 --> 00:47:18,505
No, you don't!
You stay right here!

832
00:47:18,506 --> 00:47:21,306
I'm going to make all the money
that comes into this house!

833
00:47:21,307 --> 00:47:22,500
Well, do it then!

834
00:47:22,501 --> 00:47:25,000
I ain't anxious to go back to the hall
and let the girls give me the laugh...

835
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:27,441
...for marrying a guy and then
having to support him.

836
00:47:27,442 --> 00:47:29,500
You keep away from that dance hall.

837
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:30,820
What am I supposed to be doing...

838
00:47:30,821 --> 00:47:33,100
while you're hanging on to
a hunk of steel crying...

839
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:36,301
"I can't do it, I can't climb,
I'm afraid!"

840
00:47:36,302 --> 00:47:39,602
Were you ever up that high
with only six inches of steel...

841
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:41,703
...as a foothold between you and hell?

842
00:47:41,704 --> 00:47:44,204
What have you got to live for
if you're so afraid of dying?

843
00:47:46,105 --> 00:47:49,005
By the way, have you got
any life insurance?

844
00:47:51,506 --> 00:47:54,006
Oh, what a guy.

845
00:47:58,007 --> 00:48:00,407
Keep on using that same tonic.

846
00:48:00,408 --> 00:48:02,108
It's all the medicine you need.

847
00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:03,209
Yes, doctor.

848
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:05,810
I don't think it'll be necessary
for me to come back again.

849
00:48:05,811 --> 00:48:07,811
How long is he gonna be
laid up, Doctor?

850
00:48:07,812 --> 00:48:09,512
Well, that's up to him.

851
00:48:09,513 --> 00:48:11,483
You know, Mr. Allen,

852
00:48:11,484 --> 00:48:15,284
I think your trouble's much more
mental than physical.

853
00:48:15,285 --> 00:48:17,785
It's my nerves, Doctor.

854
00:48:17,786 --> 00:48:21,800
They're troublesome things. Knock you out
when they get the best of you.

855
00:48:21,801 --> 00:48:24,000
- Yeah.
- But you got to knock them out.

856
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:26,101
It can be done, you know.

857
00:48:26,102 --> 00:48:28,102
Get a grip on yourself.

858
00:48:28,103 --> 00:48:29,999
- Oh, Doctor.
- Hm?

859
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
- About your bill.
- Oh, yes.

860
00:48:32,001 --> 00:48:36,101
My visit and the medicine, $9.

861
00:48:36,102 --> 00:48:38,332
Well, what I wanted to say was...

862
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:41,100
You wouldn't mind waiting
for it, Doctor?

863
00:48:41,101 --> 00:48:44,601
I haven't got the nine dollars
just now.

864
00:48:44,602 --> 00:48:46,102
Is it that bad, son?

865
00:48:46,103 --> 00:48:48,603
- But you said I'll get well soon.
- Yes.

866
00:48:48,604 --> 00:48:52,000
When I get back to working
I'll pay you back with interest.

867
00:48:52,001 --> 00:48:54,400
That's all right, don't worry.

868
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:55,901
Just get well.

869
00:48:56,602 --> 00:48:58,102
Goodbye.

870
00:49:01,203 --> 00:49:02,733
Oh, Mrs. Allen.

871
00:49:04,534 --> 00:49:07,134
If there's no money, how about food?

872
00:49:07,135 --> 00:49:10,385
Our credit's still good.
I'll see he gets it somehow.

873
00:49:10,386 --> 00:49:12,886
That'll be fine.
But get him out in the open.

874
00:49:12,887 --> 00:49:15,567
- This place is so stuffy.
- It's that maid!

875
00:49:15,568 --> 00:49:17,900
- I'll see about it right away, Doctor.
- Good, good.

876
00:49:17,901 --> 00:49:19,601
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Doctor.

877
00:49:20,002 --> 00:49:22,000
Lizzie! Hey, Lizzie!

878
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:24,001
- Yessum?
- Come up here!

879
00:49:26,402 --> 00:49:27,902
Can you imagine me living
in a place...

880
00:49:27,903 --> 00:49:30,200
...that even a stranger has to make
cracks about us being dirty?

881
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:31,751
- You want me, Mrs. Allen?
- I sure do!

882
00:49:31,752 --> 00:49:33,800
What's the idea of passing up this place
when you're cleaning the rooms?

883
00:49:33,801 --> 00:49:36,001
Oh, it's no use starting
anything, Shirley.

884
00:49:36,002 --> 00:49:37,802
Well, there's going to be trouble
anyway, Mrs. Allen.

885
00:49:37,803 --> 00:49:39,223
Mrs. Smith said to me this morning...

886
00:49:39,224 --> 00:49:42,450
...cause you ain't paid your rent for
so long she's gonna ask you to get out.

887
00:49:42,451 --> 00:49:43,751
But she can't do that.

888
00:49:43,752 --> 00:49:46,422
That's a nice one. Put a sick man
out in the street, eh?

889
00:49:46,423 --> 00:49:48,300
Says you owe her fifteen bucks.

890
00:49:48,301 --> 00:49:52,500
But I'll pay her, I'll pay it all back to
her as soon as I get back to work.

891
00:49:52,501 --> 00:49:54,301
That's what I told her, Mr. Allen.

892
00:49:54,302 --> 00:49:58,602
She says herself you was always on time
with your rent when you was living with...

893
00:49:59,703 --> 00:50:01,000
Before she came.

894
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:03,401
Oh, so that's the story they're
telling downstairs, is it?

895
00:50:03,402 --> 00:50:05,500
Soon as he married me he got broke.

896
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:07,600
No, no, she didn't say that, Shirley.

897
00:50:07,601 --> 00:50:09,701
Look here, you go tell Mrs. Smith
I want to see her.

898
00:50:09,702 --> 00:50:11,752
I'm gonna give that gossiper
a little surprise.

899
00:50:11,753 --> 00:50:15,443
Oh, I'll tell her, but I wouldn't advise
you to start nothing funny with her.

900
00:50:15,444 --> 00:50:18,744
- Her brother's a cop, you know.
- You go tell her what I said.

901
00:50:19,745 --> 00:50:22,100
Oh, it's no use starting
anything, Shirley.

902
00:50:23,001 --> 00:50:25,881
You'd better start packing
what little's left of our things.

903
00:50:25,882 --> 00:50:27,500
Oh, no, we ain't leaving here.

904
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:29,500
But she won't trust us
for any more.

905
00:50:29,501 --> 00:50:32,000
I ain't asking her to. I'm gonna
pay what's owed her.

906
00:50:32,001 --> 00:50:33,701
What with?

907
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:40,880
- Where'd you get that?
- Oh, don't get excited.

908
00:50:40,881 --> 00:50:42,051
- Where'd you get it?
- Borrowed it.

909
00:50:42,052 --> 00:50:43,800
- Who from?
- Tony.

910
00:50:43,801 --> 00:50:44,901
Tony?

911
00:50:44,902 --> 00:50:46,462
It's an advance, I'm going back
to work for him.

912
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:48,143
But I told you I didn't want you to.

913
00:50:48,144 --> 00:50:50,624
I ain't going back to dancing.
He's putting on a floor show.

914
00:50:50,625 --> 00:50:52,325
I'm going to do a specialty,
a sing and dancing act.

915
00:50:52,326 --> 00:50:54,426
- You're lying.
- I am not!

916
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:56,927
That's a nice note. You ain't got
a dime to your name.

917
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,728
Then when I use my brains
and my talent to get some...

918
00:50:58,729 --> 00:51:00,350
...you start thinking dirty things
about me.

919
00:51:00,351 --> 00:51:02,400
I know why Tony gave you
that money.

920
00:51:02,401 --> 00:51:05,000
Bud warned me.

921
00:51:05,001 --> 00:51:07,701
- But I wouldn't listen to him.
- Bud, always Bud!

922
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:09,980
That guy's still messing into with my life
even after he's dead.

923
00:51:09,981 --> 00:51:11,981
You give that money back,
give it back, do you hear?

924
00:51:11,982 --> 00:51:15,082
- I won't let you keep it, I tell you.
- I ain't asking you if I can, I'm doing it.

925
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:18,333
I could have walked out any time these past
months and left you flat, couldn't I?

926
00:51:18,334 --> 00:51:20,234
I could be living like a queen
if I had wanted to.

927
00:51:20,235 --> 00:51:23,235
But I didn't do it, did I?
I've had offers, yes, plenty of them.

928
00:51:23,236 --> 00:51:25,136
Even since I teamed up with you.

929
00:51:25,137 --> 00:51:26,600
But I turned them all down.

930
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:29,601
And what for? To struggle
along with you.

931
00:51:29,602 --> 00:51:31,300
Well, I'm through struggling, see?

932
00:51:31,301 --> 00:51:34,401
I'm at the end of my rope and I don't
want to hang so I'm hauling in.

933
00:51:34,402 --> 00:51:35,902
Get the idea?

934
00:51:35,903 --> 00:51:38,103
Alright, then take that money
and clear out of here.

935
00:51:38,104 --> 00:51:40,804
Oh, no, whether you want me
or not, I stick.

936
00:51:40,805 --> 00:51:42,705
There's no use you putting
on an act, John.

937
00:51:42,706 --> 00:51:44,506
You didn't know where the money
came from, you took it...

938
00:51:44,507 --> 00:51:46,907
...and ate what it bought and it
didn't poison you, I notice.

939
00:51:46,908 --> 00:51:48,888
Now that you know, what difference
does it make?

940
00:51:48,889 --> 00:51:51,100
I didn't know what kind of
money it was.

941
00:51:51,801 --> 00:51:54,461
Oh, I don't know what keeps
me from killing you.

942
00:51:54,462 --> 00:51:56,862
If you did, the goose would stop
laying the golden eggs.

943
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:59,463
- I hate you!
- I don't doubt it.

944
00:51:59,464 --> 00:52:03,000
But I'm gonna do that song and dance
at Tony's like I said I was.

945
00:52:03,001 --> 00:52:07,701
And get this. No matter what you do, whether
you're taking the money or not, I am.

946
00:52:11,402 --> 00:52:12,702
Come in.

947
00:52:13,803 --> 00:52:15,803
You want to see me, Mrs. Allen?

948
00:52:15,804 --> 00:52:19,000
It's Mr. Allen, he's got
something for you.

949
00:52:20,101 --> 00:52:22,001
Yes, Mr. Allen?

950
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,999
Here.

951
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,100
Here's the rent I owe you.

952
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:37,501
Fifteen dollars is all you owe.

953
00:52:37,652 --> 00:52:39,102
Thanks.

954
00:53:10,003 --> 00:53:12,703
Well, big boy, what do I
look like now?

955
00:53:13,304 --> 00:53:15,004
You look just like what you are.

956
00:53:15,005 --> 00:53:18,705
Yeah, I look like the wife of
John Allen the good provider.

957
00:53:20,606 --> 00:53:22,006
Get those things out of here.

958
00:53:22,707 --> 00:53:25,207
- Take those clothes off.
- Oh, no, I just put them on.

959
00:53:25,208 --> 00:53:29,308
A few jealous cats are gonna see what
it means to make a successful marriage.

960
00:53:29,309 --> 00:53:32,409
Now see here!
I ain't standing for this any longer.

961
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,910
I stood for you paying the rent
because I couldn't help myself.

962
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:37,211
But if you go out with them things on,

963
00:53:37,212 --> 00:53:39,612
advertise what you brought me to,
you can stay out.

964
00:53:39,613 --> 00:53:43,473
You got it backwards, big boy.
I'm feeding the kitty now, see?

965
00:53:43,474 --> 00:53:46,000
There ain't anybody gonna bring
that kind of money into this house.

966
00:53:46,001 --> 00:53:47,001
That kind of money.

967
00:53:47,002 --> 00:53:50,402
Since when did you begin to examine
a dollar and see who it's father was?

968
00:53:50,803 --> 00:53:55,603
What do you want to stay here for
when you're doing so well by yourself?

969
00:53:55,604 --> 00:53:59,704
I found out that a missus can get away
with things that a miss can't.

970
00:53:59,705 --> 00:54:02,999
That's why all the girls all look up to me
and try to get tips on how I do it.

971
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,600
Yeah, you give them the tips alright.

972
00:54:06,601 --> 00:54:09,501
You'll have them as low as you are
before you're through.

973
00:54:09,802 --> 00:54:11,702
Why shouldn't I give them a hand?

974
00:54:11,703 --> 00:54:13,603
That is, the ones that are worth it.

975
00:54:13,604 --> 00:54:15,700
I've only found one so far.

976
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:18,901
You'd be interested in her.
You introduced her to me.

977
00:54:18,902 --> 00:54:21,202
- I never introduced you to any girl.
- Sure you did!

978
00:54:21,203 --> 00:54:23,103
At Bud's funeral.

979
00:54:24,204 --> 00:54:26,304
- Annie?
- That's the one.

980
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,400
She's been around a couple of times...

981
00:54:27,401 --> 00:54:29,600
...to see if I couldn't get Tony
to take her on at the hall.

982
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:31,151
You mean...

983
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:34,402
- You mean you're gonna put Annie on...
- Why shouldn't I give her a break?

984
00:54:34,403 --> 00:54:36,003
- You can't do that.
- Do what?

985
00:54:36,004 --> 00:54:40,104
You can't... you can't make
a tramp out of Annie!

986
00:54:40,105 --> 00:54:43,200
Who's making anything out of her?
She's tired of working at the box factory.

987
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:44,301
None of the fellows ever take her out...

988
00:54:44,302 --> 00:54:45,802
...and she wants me to put her
next to some good times.

989
00:54:45,803 --> 00:54:48,903
You can't do that! She was Buddy's steady
company. He was going to marry her.

990
00:54:49,404 --> 00:54:51,404
I don't care what you do
to yourself or to me.

991
00:54:51,405 --> 00:54:53,205
But you can't do anything
like that to her.

992
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,456
- Say, do you think I...
- Leave her alone, do you hear?

993
00:54:55,457 --> 00:54:58,257
- Don't make me laugh, it'll crack my lips.
- Now listen to me, Shirley.

994
00:54:58,258 --> 00:55:00,800
You can do what you want to your own life
but don't go messing into Bud's.

995
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:03,201
Who's messing into it?
Did I go after his girl?

996
00:55:03,202 --> 00:55:05,602
No! She comes up and makes
a proposition herself.

997
00:55:05,603 --> 00:55:07,703
And anyway, is she any better
than I am?

998
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:10,904
If it's all right for me to work this way,
why is she too good for it?

999
00:55:14,005 --> 00:55:16,605
Here's a buck in case you run
out of cigarettes or something.

1000
00:55:36,706 --> 00:55:38,606
Hiya, John!

1001
00:55:40,407 --> 00:55:42,207
- What do you want?
- Ain't you seen the papers?

1002
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:44,708
- What about the papers?
- The horses.

1003
00:55:44,709 --> 00:55:47,500
The horses? You mean the ones I...

1004
00:55:47,501 --> 00:55:49,800
You sure picked them pretty
this time, John.

1005
00:55:49,801 --> 00:55:51,201
You mean the horses won?

1006
00:55:51,202 --> 00:55:53,700
The whole layout. Niftiest parlay
I've ever seen.

1007
00:55:53,701 --> 00:55:55,901
- In the second Jean King comes up...
- How much?

1008
00:55:56,302 --> 00:55:58,402
- How much did I make?
- $388!

1009
00:55:58,403 --> 00:56:01,303
- 388?
- Not bad for a vice, huh?

1010
00:56:01,304 --> 00:56:03,564
I'll bet that partner of yours sure
would like to have been in on this.

1011
00:56:03,565 --> 00:56:06,565
I didn't have no partner!
I was in this alone.

1012
00:56:06,566 --> 00:56:08,466
I mean the fellow you used
to bunk with.

1013
00:56:08,467 --> 00:56:10,577
- Bud?
- Yeah, that's him.

1014
00:56:10,578 --> 00:56:12,600
Remember how he always
used to play for a big kill?

1015
00:56:12,601 --> 00:56:15,900
All the boys are talking about this.
They want to know where you got your tip.

1016
00:56:15,901 --> 00:56:17,400
No, no. it was not tip.

1017
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,401
Yeah... yes, it was.

1018
00:56:21,202 --> 00:56:23,800
I got it from Bud, that's who.

1019
00:56:23,853 --> 00:56:26,103
- Which Bud?
- Yeah, he made me lay that bet.

1020
00:56:26,104 --> 00:56:27,800
He showed me how to play
them horses.

1021
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,031
Hey, what are you talking about?
He's been under the ground for months.

1022
00:56:30,032 --> 00:56:32,832
- Where's the money, where is it?
- Don't get excited, you'll get it.

1023
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,133
Three hundred and eighty-eight.

1024
00:56:34,134 --> 00:56:37,034
You'll be able to clear up
a lot of debts with $388.

1025
00:56:37,035 --> 00:56:38,600
Yeah, you bet I will.

1026
00:56:38,601 --> 00:56:40,701
I'll clear them all off.

1027
00:56:40,702 --> 00:56:43,402
Yeah, that's what Bud would
have wanted me to do.

1028
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:45,673
That's why he showed me how
to play them horses.

1029
00:56:45,674 --> 00:56:48,800
- Say, I wouldn't talk like that.
- Yes, I've got it all written down here.

1030
00:56:48,801 --> 00:56:51,101
Nine dollars for the doctor.

1031
00:56:51,102 --> 00:56:53,202
Fifteen for the back room rent.

1032
00:56:53,203 --> 00:56:54,603
And then seven and a half.

1033
00:56:54,604 --> 00:56:56,504
I've got it all written down here.

1034
00:56:56,505 --> 00:56:58,505
Here, give me a pencil,
give me a pencil quick.

1035
00:56:58,506 --> 00:57:00,406
I can remember every cent of it.

1036
00:57:00,407 --> 00:57:03,407
There... nine dollars...

1037
00:57:03,408 --> 00:57:06,208
Fifteen... seven and a half...

1038
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:08,309
There.

1039
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:11,710
And this dollar!

1040
00:57:13,011 --> 00:57:13,811
Yeah...

1041
00:57:15,412 --> 00:57:18,012
That's a hundred and sixty-two.

1042
00:57:18,013 --> 00:57:20,400
A hundred and sixty-two dollars.

1043
00:57:21,201 --> 00:57:23,501
Not counting what he gave her.

1044
00:57:23,502 --> 00:57:26,666
But this is the only part of it
I've got to clear off!

1045
00:57:26,667 --> 00:57:27,967
What are you saying?

1046
00:57:27,968 --> 00:57:31,000
- Here, give me the money, give me $162.
- There's three hundred and eighty-eight.

1047
00:57:31,001 --> 00:57:33,131
No, I don't want it!
I only want 162!

1048
00:57:34,832 --> 00:57:38,300
No... No, I...

1049
00:57:38,301 --> 00:57:40,401
I gotta have another ten.

1050
00:57:40,402 --> 00:57:42,802
Yeah, I gotta have another ten-spot.

1051
00:57:42,803 --> 00:57:45,703
Yeah, that's for... never mind.

1052
00:57:45,704 --> 00:57:47,404
Give me 172.

1053
00:57:47,405 --> 00:57:50,605
- Take it all.
- I don't want it, I want 172!

1054
00:57:52,006 --> 00:57:53,906
That's mine, isn't it?

1055
00:57:54,607 --> 00:57:57,907
I didn't get this from him
or from her, did I?

1056
00:57:57,908 --> 00:57:59,608
Take it easy, take it easy!

1057
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,409
Yeah, yeah...

1058
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:03,110
Yeah, I gotta take it easy.

1059
00:58:03,711 --> 00:58:07,111
Yeah, I got a lot of things to do.

1060
00:58:07,112 --> 00:58:09,712
Give me a cigarette, will you?

1061
00:58:09,713 --> 00:58:11,513
Yeah, that'll steady me a bit.

1062
00:58:11,514 --> 00:58:13,314
Light it for me, will you?

1063
00:58:13,315 --> 00:58:16,215
Eighty, ninety, a hundred and ten...

1064
00:58:16,216 --> 00:58:19,116
A hundred and fifty,
a hundred and fifty-two...

1065
00:58:19,717 --> 00:58:22,217
A hundred and sixty.

1066
00:58:22,218 --> 00:58:23,999
Sixty-one, two...

1067
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,200
There, take that back.

1068
00:58:26,601 --> 00:58:28,001
Thanks.

1069
00:58:28,702 --> 00:58:32,002
Yeah... yeah, I got something to do.

1070
00:58:33,103 --> 00:58:36,103
Yeah, just a minute, just a minute.

1071
00:58:48,204 --> 00:58:50,444
- You see this?
- It's a teacup.

1072
00:58:50,445 --> 00:58:52,200
Yeah, that's what you think it is.

1073
00:58:52,201 --> 00:58:54,701
But it ain't, it's more than that.

1074
00:58:54,702 --> 00:58:57,102
I've carried it with me
wherever I've gone.

1075
00:58:57,103 --> 00:58:59,603
I've had to hide it so she
wouldn't find it.

1076
00:59:00,404 --> 00:59:03,804
Once this was filled with
bootleg liquor.

1077
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:06,105
That's what started it all.

1078
00:59:06,106 --> 00:59:09,200
And then it was filled with the blood
of my dearest friend.

1079
00:59:09,201 --> 00:59:11,200
My buddy, you understand?

1080
00:59:11,201 --> 00:59:14,201
And now it's filled with
rotten money, see?

1081
00:59:14,902 --> 00:59:18,100
But I'm gonna clean it all out now, see?
That's what I need the money for.

1082
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:20,701
I'm gonna pay it all back,
I gonna be free!

1083
00:59:21,602 --> 00:59:23,002
Yeah!

1084
00:59:23,003 --> 00:59:24,703
I'm gonna be free!

1085
00:59:39,504 --> 00:59:42,404
- How much are they?
- Only sixty-five bucks.

1086
00:59:43,405 --> 00:59:45,805
Well, I ain't asking you for
real ones, Tony.

1087
00:59:45,806 --> 00:59:48,206
I suppose I'll have to buy
them for you.

1088
00:59:48,207 --> 00:59:50,107
Give me the money.
I got them all picked out.

1089
00:59:50,108 --> 00:59:51,808
Oh, you have, eh?

1090
00:59:52,709 --> 00:59:55,509
You knew I'd give in, didn't you?

1091
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:01,980
- John!
- What are you doing here?

1092
01:00:01,981 --> 01:00:04,100
- What did you come here for anyway?
- You!

1093
01:00:04,122 --> 01:00:05,900
What are you trying to do,
spoil everything?

1094
01:00:05,901 --> 01:00:07,801
Oh, no, I'm going to set
everything straight.

1095
01:00:07,802 --> 01:00:10,000
What is this, a frame-up?
Are you two trying to frame me?

1096
01:00:10,001 --> 01:00:11,701
Oh, no, Tony, I ain't in on this,
I swear it!

1097
01:00:11,702 --> 01:00:14,302
Trying to pull the outraged husband
gag on me, are you?

1098
01:00:14,303 --> 01:00:16,000
- Well, we'll see about that.
- You stay where you are!

1099
01:00:16,001 --> 01:00:17,401
- What is this?
- Look!

1100
01:00:17,402 --> 01:00:19,102
I've got it all written down here.

1101
01:00:19,103 --> 01:00:20,983
Nine dollars for the doctor,
fifteen for the room rent...

1102
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:23,300
- What is this anyway?
- Forty-five dollars more for the rent.

1103
01:00:23,301 --> 01:00:25,601
And here's for the food.
I've got it all written down here.

1104
01:00:25,602 --> 01:00:28,602
- It all adds up to $162.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1105
01:00:28,603 --> 01:00:30,000
What do you think you're doing
anyway, John?

1106
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,900
I'm trying to square things
with myself, that's what.

1107
01:00:31,901 --> 01:00:34,500
$162, that's what I took off of him.

1108
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:37,801
Well, I've got the $162 now,
I'm giving them back.

1109
01:00:37,802 --> 01:00:40,102
Here it is, a hundred and sixty-two.

1110
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:41,980
You can count it if you want to,
it's all there.

1111
01:00:41,981 --> 01:00:44,181
- I don't want your money!
- You can't get out of it that way!

1112
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,782
It's yours, take it, see?

1113
01:00:45,783 --> 01:00:48,283
- And now, you!
- Tony!

1114
01:00:48,284 --> 01:00:50,900
Yeah, it was you who made
a rat out of me.

1115
01:00:50,901 --> 01:00:54,101
Made me ashamed so I couldn't
hold my face up.

1116
01:00:54,102 --> 01:00:56,502
But I paid him off now.

1117
01:00:56,503 --> 01:00:58,700
And as soon as I've paid you I'm gonna
be square with everyone.

1118
01:00:58,701 --> 01:01:00,801
- Tony!
- No, I ain't gonna hurt you, Tony.

1119
01:01:00,802 --> 01:01:02,902
It was a business deal
with you, see?

1120
01:01:02,903 --> 01:01:04,803
- But her!
- Give me another chance, John,

1121
01:01:04,804 --> 01:01:08,504
- I'll play fair, I swear I will.
- Oh, no, you can't, Shirley.

1122
01:01:08,505 --> 01:01:11,705
Buddy was right.
You were born rotten.

1123
01:01:11,706 --> 01:01:15,000
And now you're trying to make
other girls as rotten as you are.

1124
01:01:15,001 --> 01:01:17,171
No, I ain't... I won't touch that Annie
girl if you don't want me to.

1125
01:01:17,172 --> 01:01:18,972
No, no, it ain't her especially.

1126
01:01:18,973 --> 01:01:21,073
She only helped put me
wise to you.

1127
01:01:21,074 --> 01:01:25,374
You told me to think about where the money
comes from that I've been spending.

1128
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,600
Well, I have thought about it.

1129
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:30,201
- And that's why I'm here.
- Tony, he's going to kill me!

1130
01:01:30,202 --> 01:01:33,342
- Yeah, I'm gonna kill you.
- No! No!

1131
01:01:33,343 --> 01:01:35,443
If I don't, you're gonna
go on like this.

1132
01:01:35,444 --> 01:01:37,644
From Tony to another man
and from him to somebody else.

1133
01:01:37,645 --> 01:01:39,845
Always making yourself cheaper
and dirtier.

1134
01:01:39,846 --> 01:01:42,456
No I won't, no I won't! If you let me alone,
I swear I'll be on the level.

1135
01:01:42,457 --> 01:01:44,157
Yeah, that's what you think now,
but you won't.

1136
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:47,158
It will be the best thing for all
of us if I stop it right now.

1137
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:51,159
Help! Help!

1138
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:59,260
And so, young man, my personal
desire is to be lenient with you...

1139
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:02,261
...in view of certain extenuating
circumstances in the case.

1140
01:02:02,262 --> 01:02:06,262
Unfortunately, however, I am bound
by the dictates of the law.

1141
01:02:06,999 --> 01:02:09,900
Just why you didn't permit your council
to make any defense for you...

1142
01:02:09,901 --> 01:02:11,301
I don't know.

1143
01:02:11,302 --> 01:02:14,502
It seems to me you could very well
have pleaded justification.

1144
01:02:14,503 --> 01:02:17,000
Or you might have pleaded
temporary insanity.

1145
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:20,301
The evidence of the detectives
who arrested you at the steelworks...

1146
01:02:20,302 --> 01:02:22,802
...indicates a least a temporary
mental derangement.

1147
01:02:23,303 --> 01:02:27,203
However, since you refused to take
advantage of any of these defenses,

1148
01:02:27,404 --> 01:02:32,304
there is no alternative left me than to find
you guilty of murder in the first degree...

1149
01:02:32,305 --> 01:02:34,905
...and sentence you to death
in the electric chair.

1150
01:02:36,006 --> 01:02:38,406
Is there anything you wish to say...

1151
01:02:38,407 --> 01:02:40,907
...before I pass formal sentence
upon you?

1152
01:02:46,308 --> 01:02:52,900
All that you said about the
shooting being premeditated,

1153
01:02:53,501 --> 01:02:55,901
is quite true, Your Honor.

1154
01:02:55,902 --> 01:02:58,702
Yeah, I did it just like you heard.

1155
01:02:59,503 --> 01:03:02,803
I was never quite sure when
I'd be able to do it.

1156
01:03:02,804 --> 01:03:05,804
But something inside of me
kept hoping that...

1157
01:03:05,805 --> 01:03:09,005
...someday, somehow I'd be able to.

1158
01:03:10,306 --> 01:03:13,999
Maybe that's why I played the ponies.

1159
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,900
Played them without really knowing why.

1160
01:03:16,901 --> 01:03:19,701
As soon as that bookie told me
how much I'd won,

1161
01:03:19,702 --> 01:03:22,442
I knew at once what I had to do.

1162
01:03:22,443 --> 01:03:25,500
No, I wasn't crazy, Your Honor.

1163
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,801
I knew all along what I was doing.

1164
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:29,702
Yeah, I was...

1165
01:03:29,703 --> 01:03:33,303
What I can't understand now...

1166
01:03:33,304 --> 01:03:36,404
is why you're giving me
the chair for that.

1167
01:03:36,905 --> 01:03:40,105
You... you've got it all wrong, see?

1168
01:03:41,206 --> 01:03:46,006
If you'd have burned me
when I was living off of her,

1169
01:03:46,607 --> 01:03:50,107
that would have been the right
time to do it, see?

1170
01:03:51,508 --> 01:03:55,808
At first I thought I'd only take what
I needed, what I had to have.

1171
01:03:55,809 --> 01:03:59,409
It wasn't my fault I had to have it
and I couldn't get it myself.

1172
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:04,910
But I knew where it was coming from.

1173
01:04:04,911 --> 01:04:07,211
And I took it just the same.

1174
01:04:07,212 --> 01:04:11,000
That's when you should have
given me the chair!

1175
01:04:11,001 --> 01:04:14,501
I sunk as low as a guy can get.

1176
01:04:14,502 --> 01:04:17,302
Yeah, but nobody did anything to me.

1177
01:04:19,003 --> 01:04:25,103
And then I got that break with
the ponies like I was telling you.

1178
01:04:25,104 --> 01:04:27,404
And when I got it,
what did I do with it?

1179
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:30,005
Blow it in on a good time? No!

1180
01:04:30,806 --> 01:04:35,206
I went out and I paid off my
debt to him...

1181
01:04:35,207 --> 01:04:36,607
...and to her.

1182
01:04:36,608 --> 01:04:41,008
Yeah, I did it so I could hold
my face up again.

1183
01:04:41,999 --> 01:04:45,209
And for that you want to kill me.

1184
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:52,410
Well, don't you see? You're killing
me at the wrong time.

1185
01:04:52,411 --> 01:04:56,811
If you'd have killed me
when I was a rat,

1186
01:04:56,812 --> 01:04:59,100
I'd have thanked you for it,
but you didn't.

1187
01:04:59,101 --> 01:05:02,401
And now that I've squared everything
off you want to kill me.

1188
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:04,802
Well it ain't fair!

1189
01:05:06,003 --> 01:05:12,203
It ain't fair to let a rat live
and kill a man.

1190
01:05:12,204 --> 01:05:14,804
No, it ain't reasonable!

1191
01:05:14,805 --> 01:05:17,005
It don't make sense.

1192
01:05:18,506 --> 01:05:21,306
I won't let you do it, I tell you!

1193
01:05:21,307 --> 01:05:23,607
I won't!

1194
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:30,708
You're only gonna make me sick
like I was when Buddy fell.

1195
01:05:31,809 --> 01:05:35,209
You're gonna bring that fever
back on me again.

1196
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:40,010
No, I don't want to get sick.
I can't!

1197
01:05:40,011 --> 01:05:43,811
I got a lot of things to explain
to you yet.

1198
01:05:44,912 --> 01:05:48,912
You're bringing that fever
back on me again.

1199
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:53,213
The blood's rushing to my head.

1200
01:05:53,214 --> 01:05:58,999
Oh, I'm getting all dizzy...
My thoughts are all getting jammed up.

1201
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Stop it, you!
Stop it!

1202
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:09,300
Stop it! What are you doing?
Stop it, stop it!

1203
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:14,700
Buddy... don't go away!

1204
01:06:14,999 --> 01:06:17,201
Wait for me.

1205
01:06:17,202 --> 01:06:19,402
I'm coming.

1206
01:06:19,403 --> 01:06:22,903
Bud! Wait for me!

1207
01:06:31,204 --> 01:06:32,804
All right, Doctor.

1208
01:06:45,705 --> 01:06:54,000
