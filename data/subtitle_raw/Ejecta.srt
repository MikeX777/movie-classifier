2
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:20,439
Tonight the universe is
no bigger than my head.

3
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:25,095
It's time to make room
 for some visitors.

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,969
So, dio they talk to you?

5
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:36,710
What, in their own voice
you mean? No.

6
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:39,991
Well, they...they talk through me.

7
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:43,084
They speak inside my mind

8
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:45,599
We're on target.

9
00:00:45,624 --> 00:00:47,624
I can feel them.

10
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:49,649
Steady...

11
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:54,328
Sorry about the build up.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,431
I could feel them.
I could...I could hear them inside.

13
00:01:01,744 --> 00:01:03,744
Pretty much on me.

14
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,948
They had this...meeting.

15
00:01:06,973 --> 00:01:08,973
and then they left.

16
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:12,977
Stay alert.

17
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:16,049
See if you can get it.

18
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:17,875
And that was it?

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,517
No, that wasn't it.

20
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:21,869
They left something behind.

21
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:24,317
Something inside of me that's
been there ever since.

22
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:27,835
Approaching the house. Stay tight.

23
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:31,410
When I'm awake, it hurts.

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,440
But when I'm...

25
00:01:33,465 --> 00:01:36,730
When I'm not, it
floods me with these

26
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:38,933
nightmares.

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,150
Nightmares, no. Nightmares, it's
not nightmares.

28
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:45,802
It...it's not a thing, it...
it's a feeling.

29
00:01:45,827 --> 00:01:49,011
It...it's not pain, it's not...
it's not fear.

30
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:53,572
It...it's something else. It's
something much, much worse.

31
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,330
Go, go. Move.

32
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:01,589
Go. You hit.

33
00:02:02,926 --> 00:02:05,292
Why don't you take
a few painkillers

34
00:02:05,317 --> 00:02:06,737
before bed, just
knock yourself out?

35
00:02:06,818 --> 00:02:08,818
I've tried everything.

36
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,593
Everything.

37
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:14,124
Everything?

38
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:17,983
And it just never works.

39
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,397
No fatigue. Stroke.

40
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:26,205
Got you.

41
00:02:28,369 --> 00:02:30,925
Please stay tight. Stay tight!

42
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:36,581
Fuck! What the fuck!

43
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:38,724
You should get some help.

44
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,732
Oh, I've...

45
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:44,419
I've seen doctors.

46
00:02:44,677 --> 00:02:48,072
And they say I'm in
peak of physical health.

47
00:02:48,103 --> 00:02:50,989
All I need is a little more sleep.

48
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:52,740
-What the hell did you do?
-Something was there.

49
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:53,793
What are you doing?

50
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:55,660
I saw it, sir. It was
right behind Stevenson.

51
00:02:55,684 --> 00:02:57,130
What the fuck?

52
00:02:57,154 --> 00:02:58,763
So, did you try it?

53
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:00,788
No.

54
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:05,702
All I allow myself is a few

55
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,374
hours of sleep every few days.

56
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:14,408
Go ahead, move! Bring it in!

57
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:15,586
Target's on you.

58
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,485
Take it! Take it!
Target's on you! Go, go, go!

59
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,766
Pull out! Pull out!

60
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,790
If a doctor tells you to sleep,

61
00:03:21,814 --> 00:03:24,373
maybe you should sleep.
-You don't understand.

62
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:27,254
There is something inside of
me that...

63
00:03:27,278 --> 00:03:30,405
a comfortable pillow

64
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:33,145
will not fix!
-Will! I believe you, I do.

65
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:35,456
I'm making this
film so that other

66
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,688
people will believe you,too.

67
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:38,789
I don't care if people
believe me or not.

68
00:03:38,813 --> 00:03:42,152
Yes, you do. We've been
discussing it for years.

69
00:03:42,176 --> 00:03:43,053
If you don't care what

70
00:03:43,078 --> 00:03:44,176
other people think,

71
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,452
then what do you want?

72
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:49,066
I just want someone to
tell me how to make it stop!

73
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:53,526
How to pull it out
of my head!

74
00:03:54,107 --> 00:03:56,679
I cannot...cannot close
my eyes

75
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,384
for them to tear them out!

76
00:03:58,385 --> 00:03:59,757
Alright, men!

77
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:01,782
Put a bullet through my head!

78
00:04:05,294 --> 00:04:07,306
I fear that...

79
00:04:07,307 --> 00:04:08,648
that...

80
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:10,864
The...the...anticipation...

81
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:13,632
of...of...this feeling...

82
00:04:13,656 --> 00:04:15,656
eats away at my life.

83
00:04:16,886 --> 00:04:18,147
Hold your fire!

84
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:20,697
I need that man alive,
do you hear me?

85
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,586
Put your goddam gun away, rookie.

86
00:04:23,812 --> 00:04:25,343
Bullets through and through.

87
00:04:27,798 --> 00:04:30,359
But he's alive.

88
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:33,538
Do you understand?

89
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:35,749
Tell me what it feels like.
Does it hurt?

90
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:37,990
It hurts! OK?

91
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:40,014
It...it hurts.

92
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:44,888
Do you know how
to follow orders, soldier?

93
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:47,404
Do you know how
to follow orders?

94
00:04:47,428 --> 00:04:49,960
You almost killed one of
my men in my target.

95
00:04:52,256 --> 00:04:53,468
Copy that.

96
00:04:54,648 --> 00:04:56,648
Don't worry about it, soldier.

97
00:05:04,663 --> 00:05:06,663
This is how we follow orders, soldier.

98
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,748
No!

99
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:08,866
No!

100
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:16,383
I've always found it strange

101
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:17,747
that humans even bother
to

102
00:05:17,772 --> 00:05:19,772
try and imagine the end of the world.

103
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:23,303
Staging areas,

104
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,327
ships to flee on,

105
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:28,097
lotteries for tickets
off the planet.

106
00:05:29,613 --> 00:05:31,152
We're all so stupid.

107
00:05:32,644 --> 00:05:35,711
The beginning of the end
as they say.

108
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:38,907
But that's long
begun by now.

109
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:41,525
Truth is when it hits,

110
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,452
You will simply cease

111
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,477
to do the stupid little things

112
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:47,022
that you do.

113
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,047
Just like that.

114
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,875
Ten month...

115
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,657
if it's the big one...

116
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,728
like the sun storm of 1859,

117
00:05:56,752 --> 00:05:58,752
the carrying event

118
00:05:58,776 --> 00:05:59,906
as it's called,

119
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:03,641
Then there's no
such thing as tomorrow.

120
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:08,356
She lifts up the sun
like a fiery wing.

121
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,614
It whips back and snaps.
She breaks loose.

122
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,638
Cosmic inferno like a

123
00:06:13,663 --> 00:06:14,810
moveable hell

124
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,815
sprays millions and millions of miles
as if it were nothing.

125
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,346
A cough. A sneeze.

126
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,650
And then, it hits us.

127
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,675
Yes indeed.

128
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:27,699
It's going to hit us.

129
00:06:27,723 --> 00:06:29,723
And when it hits us,

130
00:06:29,747 --> 00:06:32,372
When it comes crashing through

131
00:06:32,396 --> 00:06:34,396
our flimsy atmosphere,

132
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,420
the good will collapse,

133
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:39,615
the magnetic poles reverse,

134
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,756
And you know what that means?

135
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,787
The entire surface of the planet

136
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:47,968
heaves. Its molten heart bursts!

137
00:06:47,993 --> 00:06:52,572
And we all drown in
a lake of eternal fire!

138
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:57,525
Then we go to Jesus!

139
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:04,285
Maybe we could just get a
little lecture.

140
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,668
That's all for now, folks.

141
00:07:10,872 --> 00:07:12,872
I have a scar. I'm telling you.

142
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:16,443
Just show it off and
bang! There it was on the radar.

143
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:19,931
I don't know, man.
I wouldn't get too excited.

144
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:23,894
Seen him before.
Ha, ha, ha. As was our cliche.

145
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,783
Opened his eyes. Almost
blew over our head.

146
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:29,085
Never seen him so
sure of himself.

147
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:36,311
Sir?

148
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:39,131
Are you okay?

149
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:42,099
Can we get you something?

150
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,490
Who are you?

151
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:50,967
We're the good guys.

152
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,879
We're here to help.

153
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:56,592
Whose blood is that on your shirt?

154
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,616
Mine.

155
00:07:58,617 --> 00:07:59,927
They shot me.

156
00:07:59,952 --> 00:08:01,952
They shot you because you ran.

157
00:08:02,568 --> 00:08:04,569
Bad things happen when you disobey.

158
00:08:04,594 --> 00:08:06,139
It's best if you
 learn that now.

159
00:08:06,982 --> 00:08:08,443
Let me go.

160
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:10,467
Sit still and let's talk.

161
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:12,991
We lost a rookie tonight.

162
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:14,699
He was a good kid.

163
00:08:14,723 --> 00:08:16,723
I don't know about you,

164
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,321
but we want to end
the bloodshed.

165
00:08:18,346 --> 00:08:19,192
-And you can help us

166
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:21,723
by giving us some answers.
-I don't know anything.

167
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:23,152
Oh, come now,
that's not true.

168
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:25,176
What about...

169
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,200
the planets in our solar system?

170
00:08:27,224 --> 00:08:29,403
I'm sure you know those.

171
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:32,676
-Mars...
-Saturn. Thank you, agent.

172
00:08:33,348 --> 00:08:35,324
I have a feeling he's aware. Now.

173
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,684
I'm curious

174
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,708
what he knows about
things from

175
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,931
a little further away.

176
00:08:44,955 --> 00:08:46,173
Let me go!

177
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:52,974
-Let me go!
-You need to calm down!

178
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,795
Just...relax.

179
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,743
I told you...

180
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:03,788
to sit still, old man.

181
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:06,632
And you don't listen very well, do you

182
00:09:06,657 --> 00:09:08,250
spider Nevi?

183
00:09:32,436 --> 00:09:35,082
Please have Heather
prep the prep helmet.

184
00:09:38,332 --> 00:09:40,332
Now! Please and thank you.

185
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:03,651
William Cassidy. I
must apologize.

186
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:06,643
William Cassidy is our guest...

187
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,385
He's part of our team.

188
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,830
You know, you look a little bit rough.

189
00:10:14,595 --> 00:10:16,595
I have to admit. But I

190
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:18,629
I did not expect that you
 would look quite so old.

191
00:10:22,824 --> 00:10:26,029
Might be time to update the
profile picture on your website.

192
00:10:31,677 --> 00:10:33,270
William, I would like
you and I

193
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:35,317
to hit the reset button right now.

194
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,625
I want to like you and
I want you to like me.

195
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,392
I'm a firm believer in
straightforward conversation.

196
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:45,259
If you and I would have
a straightforward conversation

197
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:47,012
between friends,

198
00:10:47,395 --> 00:10:48,524
then we'll have a

199
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:50,036
wonderful outcome today.

200
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,934
It's so easy.

201
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,197
Don't you agree?

202
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,335
I will assume that you agree,

203
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,546
and that you're not
 being difficult right now

204
00:11:01,993 --> 00:11:06,305
So, let's start with
 a very easy question.

205
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:09,313
What happened last night?

206
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:14,283
I'm going to ask you
a few questions on camera, OK?

207
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:16,307
Is that all?

208
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:18,463
Yeah.

209
00:11:21,606 --> 00:11:23,118
OK? Yeah.

210
00:11:24,104 --> 00:11:26,813
So sorry about the confusion
before, but

211
00:11:26,837 --> 00:11:28,656
Can I ask you

212
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:31,601
if my name rings a bell
at all?

213
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,742
Why? What is it again?

214
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:37,427
Joe.

215
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,965
Joe Sullivan?

216
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,990
I got an email
from you the other night.

217
00:11:43,718 --> 00:11:44,740
No.

218
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:54,017
I never give out...
personal information online ever.

219
00:11:56,477 --> 00:11:57,619
OK.

220
00:12:00,962 --> 00:12:02,055
I'm here with...

221
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,518
Bill Cassidy.

222
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,754
Let me just say that

223
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:08,733
I have been following
your story for years.

224
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,944
And I'm doing a documentary.

225
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,452
Extra-Terrestrial activity.

226
00:12:14,476 --> 00:12:17,299
Things...beyond our atmosphere.

227
00:12:19,158 --> 00:12:21,158
So, it's obviously
a pleasure to meet you.

228
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:25,721
Yeah...Uh...

229
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:28,336
So the first question is:
You were abducted by

230
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:29,912
aliens thirty-nine years ago?

231
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:35,513
I never said abducted.

232
00:12:38,122 --> 00:12:40,491
Something came to me.

233
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,812
OK, good, That's what I want.

234
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:46,836
I want to hear what
happened in your own words.

235
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,727
My own words?

236
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:57,462
I met

237
00:12:58,593 --> 00:13:00,674
an advanced

238
00:13:00,951 --> 00:13:02,038
life

239
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:06,326
form...from somewhere else.

240
00:13:09,676 --> 00:13:11,365
You met them. What
does that mean?

241
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,123
They came here

242
00:13:15,717 --> 00:13:17,717
through the front door,
just like you.

243
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:20,679
And you just let them in?

244
00:13:21,171 --> 00:13:22,296
No.

245
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:28,187
I didn't have much choice.

246
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:32,554
They threatened you?

247
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:34,702
No.

248
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:40,976
They control me.

249
00:13:47,434 --> 00:13:48,766
So, what did they look like?

250
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:15,397
Hit William hard.

251
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,753
Please.

252
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:25,706
That's it, agent.

253
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,987
Thank you!

254
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:30,142
I'm sorry, William.

255
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:34,717
Sometimes you really have
to hit that reset button.

256
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:39,795
Now that you are clear

257
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:42,327
on what our expectations are,
you should accept them.

258
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:45,006
On the one hand,
you could disclose the

259
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,030
events of the twelve
hours or so,

260
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,054
And on the other hand,

261
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:52,324
just not really hand at all, it's
more of a toolbox

262
00:14:53,082 --> 00:14:54,457
of devices

263
00:14:56,402 --> 00:14:59,746
that you really never
want to have to see.

264
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:06,031
Tell me everything
you know, William.

265
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:11,296
I know all of you people.

266
00:15:13,824 --> 00:15:15,054
Strange, William.

267
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:17,703
Very, very strange
you with your

268
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:19,203
history.

269
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:22,398
You've been staring
at the sky

270
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:24,422
for decades now.

271
00:15:24,938 --> 00:15:26,542
Posting your theories online?

272
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:28,668
Unbelievable ideas,
some would say.

273
00:15:31,012 --> 00:15:34,463
We've had our eye on you
most of your life, now.

274
00:15:36,163 --> 00:15:39,476
Sorry. No autographs today.

275
00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:47,316
Last night, there was a
coronal mass injection.

276
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,210
You know about it. You were
a part of it. Historic.

277
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:54,866
Bigger than the Carrington event.

278
00:15:55,673 --> 00:15:57,031
This is kidnapping.

279
00:15:57,406 --> 00:15:59,634
It knocked something
out of the sky. Didn't it, William?

280
00:16:01,954 --> 00:16:03,279
Do you want to know what I

281
00:16:03,304 --> 00:16:04,591
can't get my head around?

282
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,611
There are so many
people out there just like yourself,

283
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:10,636
Colorful folks, just like you,

284
00:16:11,808 --> 00:16:15,302
who have knowledge of
or had experience with visitors.

285
00:16:17,114 --> 00:16:19,757
Yours was what?
Thirty-nine years ago?

286
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:24,254
How wonderfully vindicating
it must be for you...

287
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:27,824
to have one crash in
your backyard just last night!

288
00:16:27,848 --> 00:16:30,114
Or is that just too
much coincidence

289
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:32,457
for your weak little
story to pair?

290
00:16:33,246 --> 00:16:35,246
It's separate.

291
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,252
You find it funny
they're hitting me.

292
00:16:46,432 --> 00:16:48,432
Squaring with the enemy.

293
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:56,041
Over the years it's
gotten more drastic.

294
00:16:56,752 --> 00:16:59,649
Usually I just wake
up in bed screaming.

295
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:03,751
Sometimes, I wake up
in other places.

296
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:06,837
Yeah? Like where?

297
00:17:07,532 --> 00:17:11,695
In front of the computer, staring
at sites I've never heard of.

298
00:17:12,546 --> 00:17:14,015
Sometimes outside.

299
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,515
I've woken up walking
down the highway.

300
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,850
I've woken up floating on water.

301
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:25,567
No shorts...I...

302
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,696
I woke up two states over.

303
00:17:32,555 --> 00:17:35,414
Two weeks had passed.
I had no idea how I got there.

304
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:37,438
It had been erased from my memory.

305
00:17:40,774 --> 00:17:42,774
Once, I woke up in a field

306
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:45,446
fifteen miles from here.

307
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:49,642
I was covered in blood.

308
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:53,072
There was a horse

309
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:56,158
on the ground in front of me.

310
00:17:56,926 --> 00:18:00,332
It...it...had...been cut

311
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:02,574
down the center.

312
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:04,801
Its insides

313
00:18:05,135 --> 00:18:06,903
removed and laid out

314
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:08,927
and displayed in the grass

315
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:12,202
like an internal...road map.

316
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:17,470
Why don't we talk
about something else for a second?

317
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:20,360
Like...

318
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,610
tonight's mass ejection.

319
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:26,946
Yeah, it should...should
be interesting.

320
00:18:28,385 --> 00:18:29,493
Yeah...

321
00:18:29,924 --> 00:18:31,245
Solar flares in.

322
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,275
traveled millions of miles here and burst
through our atmosphere tonight.

323
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,488
Yeah.

324
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:38,876
There's nothing else here
that should be interesting on the ship.

325
00:18:39,555 --> 00:18:41,657
They say it's going to
interfere with the whole grid.

326
00:18:41,681 --> 00:18:43,196
World-wide blackout.

327
00:18:44,032 --> 00:18:45,415
Grounded all the flights.

328
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:46,782
Systems...

329
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:49,204
...might get knocked out
of the sky.

330
00:18:50,287 --> 00:18:52,095
All the transit's been shut down.

331
00:18:53,302 --> 00:18:54,744
I look forward to it.

332
00:18:57,158 --> 00:18:59,432
Nature has a way of
mixing things up.

333
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:04,965
Humans really are
not in control.

334
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:21,684
We'd like you to hook
up the platform.

335
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:24,577
Let's put a couple of
holes into William's head.

336
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:26,201
And see what we see.

337
00:19:33,494 --> 00:19:35,494
You want to know
 more about it?

338
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:40,954
No?

339
00:19:40,978 --> 00:19:42,171
Well, it's too bad.

340
00:19:42,484 --> 00:19:45,281
It's less destructive if
you know what to expect.

341
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:51,992
Is that comfortable?
-Heather!

342
00:19:52,661 --> 00:19:54,016
Please don't do that.

343
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:58,377
It's just...when our subjects
are more comfortable,

344
00:19:58,402 --> 00:19:59,990
we actually get better results.

345
00:20:00,014 --> 00:20:03,161
Just...stop talking.

346
00:20:03,186 --> 00:20:05,339
And finish.

347
00:20:05,363 --> 00:20:06,690
Yes, Doctor.

348
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,537
Doctor, we got something.

349
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,142
It's about time!

350
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,274
What I got here?

351
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:31,156
equals square circle.

352
00:20:31,181 --> 00:20:33,181
It appears we have an abandoned truck.

353
00:20:33,205 --> 00:20:35,096
The back of the truck is clear.

354
00:20:35,121 --> 00:20:36,939
The truck is clear.
-Copy that.

355
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:38,775
Some blood.

356
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:41,470
Something else.

357
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:48,132
Protecting...

358
00:20:48,157 --> 00:20:50,157
You know what we're
looking at here, William?

359
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:53,852
I've made this truck.

360
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,626
Hey, your insides seem valuable.

361
00:20:58,024 --> 00:21:00,644
Must be your pest
helmet, doc.

362
00:21:03,941 --> 00:21:05,941
I'm seeing a bunch of blood.

363
00:21:13,134 --> 00:21:14,376
Doctor?

364
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:16,759
You're gonna want
to see this.

365
00:21:17,883 --> 00:21:19,079
OK, bring it in.

366
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:20,422
Copy that.

367
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,954
There's a substance here.

368
00:21:23,306 --> 00:21:24,689
What is it?

369
00:21:25,453 --> 00:21:26,689
Definitely foreign.

370
00:21:27,697 --> 00:21:28,822
Sir?

371
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:33,385
It's not human.

372
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,072
Care to tell me what
you know about this truck, Bill?

373
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:45,705
No.

374
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:49,431
So, you might feel a
little sting here.

375
00:21:49,456 --> 00:21:52,341
That's not really a sting.
Kind of...kind of like a

376
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:55,630
hot blade slowly digging around
in your head.

377
00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:57,113
What is this thing?

378
00:21:57,137 --> 00:21:59,996
Oh! So now you're interested.

379
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:06,316
It pulls your thoughts
out of your mind.

380
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,358
No, we don't really know
how it actually works,

381
00:22:09,383 --> 00:22:12,211
we usually get the results
we're looking for.

382
00:22:12,235 --> 00:22:13,774
Unfortunately,there's some

383
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,403
undesirable side effects
for the subjects.

384
00:22:17,499 --> 00:22:20,192
You know, it took a
hundred years before

385
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:22,647
anybody could figure out
how to turn it on.

386
00:22:23,437 --> 00:22:24,796
Isn't that interesting?

387
00:22:27,903 --> 00:22:29,616
What happened last night, Bill?

388
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:38,762
That's a funny one.

389
00:22:41,587 --> 00:22:43,587
Can I have some more, please?

390
00:22:48,586 --> 00:22:50,620
Did I tell you that we
have figured out

391
00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:52,602
how it pulls your mind out
of your head

392
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:55,782
but we have no idea
how to put it back in?

393
00:22:57,136 --> 00:22:58,343
They're so...

394
00:22:58,368 --> 00:23:00,368
Give me some more juice.

395
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:04,415
Keep at it, girl!
Turn it up!

396
00:23:45,516 --> 00:23:47,140
Turn it off!

397
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:52,453
Check her!

398
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:56,836
What the fuck
just happened here?

399
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:03,633
Take that off.

400
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,039
You crazy?

401
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:24,102
Good?

402
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:28,099
Please take that device
off of your friend's head.

403
00:24:28,494 --> 00:24:29,509
Now.

404
00:25:02,856 --> 00:25:04,856
I order you.

405
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,332
Get rid of her!

406
00:25:17,636 --> 00:25:19,636
Is that the camera, soldier?
Bring it in.

407
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,930
Put it on the monitor.

408
00:25:27,451 --> 00:25:28,643
Thank you, soldier.

409
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:36,529
Hey, everybody.

410
00:25:36,554 --> 00:25:38,308
Joe Sullivan here.

411
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:40,331
Sully_5433

412
00:25:40,355 --> 00:25:42,576
I just got the most
 amazing email last night.

413
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,972
While I was sleeping,

414
00:25:43,995 --> 00:25:46,221
I got contacted by a god.

415
00:25:46,246 --> 00:25:48,037
OK? Hello Joe Sullivan.

416
00:25:48,062 --> 00:25:50,804
I would like you to come
meet me at the address below tomorrow.

417
00:25:50,827 --> 00:25:52,827
Spider Nevi. Spider Nevi...

418
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,851
He's the whale of astronomy.

419
00:25:55,546 --> 00:25:57,687
People have been trying to
 find this guy for years.

420
00:25:57,711 --> 00:25:59,212
But he doesn't want
to be found.

421
00:25:59,236 --> 00:26:01,236
He's off the radar, he's off
the grid,

422
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,969
not even the government
knows where he is.

423
00:26:03,984 --> 00:26:06,305
He contacted me.

424
00:26:06,329 --> 00:26:09,782
Maybe...maybe he wants
me to film him.

425
00:26:09,806 --> 00:26:11,027
Maybe he wants to talk about

426
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:12,247
the mass ejections tonight.

427
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:15,240
I mean, There are some crazy
shit going on in the atmosphere

428
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:16,724
and he decides to contact me?

429
00:26:16,748 --> 00:26:18,801
I mean, this guy's been blogging

430
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:20,591
about an alien
experience for years,

431
00:26:20,615 --> 00:26:22,455
the things that he's
writing about, the

432
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,241
concepts and the ideas,
they're just so...

433
00:26:27,272 --> 00:26:29,186
Anyway...I'm backed up.

434
00:26:29,211 --> 00:26:30,827
I'm going to need the help. Let's go.

435
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:54,654
That's where we're going.
Right over that ridge.

436
00:26:54,678 --> 00:26:56,607
I've got zero idea if
 this is anywhere close

437
00:26:56,632 --> 00:26:58,674
to real or a total scam.

438
00:26:58,699 --> 00:27:00,070
All we know is what
this guy looks

439
00:27:00,095 --> 00:27:01,565
like and that he
goes by Spider-man

440
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:04,190
Fuck. That sounds made up.

441
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,346
Not sure what to make of this.

442
00:27:08,213 --> 00:27:09,698
What the hell?

443
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:13,589
Jesus...the tanks...?

444
00:27:14,672 --> 00:27:16,672
I wonder if we can get closer?

445
00:27:29,284 --> 00:27:30,757
Howdy.

446
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:33,710
Hi sir.

447
00:27:34,408 --> 00:27:35,867
My name is Joe Sullivan.

448
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:37,891
Hi, Joe. Is that a camera?

449
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:41,297
Uh? -Yeah.
Are you filming me right now?

450
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,058
-No sir.
-I don't believe you.

451
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:44,506
You're a liar. Why
you got a camera

452
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:45,793
sitting there pointing at me?

453
00:27:45,818 --> 00:27:48,504
-I'm making a film. Uh...
-Oh, you're making a movie.

454
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:49,542
I am, sir.

455
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,104
You think there are
some interesting

456
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:52,504
people up here, aren't there?

457
00:27:54,396 --> 00:27:55,801
Go fuck yourself today.

458
00:27:59,351 --> 00:28:00,575
What about tomorrow?

459
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:04,371
Hi. Hi there.

460
00:28:04,491 --> 00:28:06,396
My name is...Joe.

461
00:28:07,944 --> 00:28:09,764
Hey! I'm Joe Sullivan.

462
00:28:11,651 --> 00:28:12,686
How you doin'?

463
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,186
Hello.

464
00:28:17,083 --> 00:28:18,530
My name is Joseph Sullivan.

465
00:28:18,554 --> 00:28:19,927
Filmmaker.

466
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,332
Astronomer.

467
00:28:21,357 --> 00:28:22,880
It's really stupid.

468
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,443
Alright. Here we go.

469
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:35,779
This is perfect.

470
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,889
Hello?

471
00:28:41,824 --> 00:28:42,913
Hello!

472
00:28:45,178 --> 00:28:46,351
Anybody here?

473
00:28:50,843 --> 00:28:53,382
He's coming...Jesus!

474
00:28:56,064 --> 00:28:57,523
Oh.

475
00:28:58,009 --> 00:28:59,547
Hey. Ha.

476
00:28:59,548 --> 00:29:01,076
You...just...

477
00:29:01,101 --> 00:29:02,321
snuck up on me there.

478
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,470
Hi, I'm...I'm Joe.

479
00:29:10,117 --> 00:29:11,384
It's...

480
00:29:13,841 --> 00:29:15,096
Uh...

481
00:29:17,163 --> 00:29:18,775
Joe Sullivan. You...

482
00:29:19,585 --> 00:29:21,079
You sent me an...

483
00:29:21,103 --> 00:29:22,632
...email last night?

484
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Uh...you're Spider Nevy?

485
00:29:29,014 --> 00:29:30,133
Um...

486
00:29:30,157 --> 00:29:32,340
Listen, I...I just...

487
00:29:32,365 --> 00:29:34,335
want to talk to you
for a few minutes

488
00:29:36,886 --> 00:29:38,206
on camera if...if...

489
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,578
Uh, I'm not going to

490
00:29:41,603 --> 00:29:43,386
take up too much of
your time, I just...

491
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:46,883
I assume you want
to tell your story.

492
00:29:46,908 --> 00:29:48,751
You know, I'm a filmmaker, I'm not

493
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:52,789
I'm not some weirdo.
I have read everything you've written...

494
00:29:53,371 --> 00:29:55,621
...I've watched everything you
have posted online...

495
00:29:55,645 --> 00:29:57,645
...And I believe your story
and I

496
00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:59,578
and I'm not here to debunk

497
00:29:59,602 --> 00:30:01,602
I'm not here to make fun
of you or

498
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:04,141
eh...you know.

499
00:30:06,352 --> 00:30:08,352
Um...I'm here to...

500
00:30:08,376 --> 00:30:11,599
listen...that's...that's all
I'm here to do.

501
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,992
I mean,hey...if this isn't
a good time, I can always

502
00:30:19,729 --> 00:30:21,195
I can always come back or...

503
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,916
you know, we can just...

504
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,940
you can give me one of
those beers and...

505
00:30:26,437 --> 00:30:27,997
We don't even have
to talk on camera or

506
00:30:28,022 --> 00:30:29,872
anything like that. I can
just put it down and

507
00:30:29,985 --> 00:30:31,492
just talk.

508
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,283
Oh...

509
00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:46,816
No...no...no...

510
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,840
No...no...

511
00:31:31,655 --> 00:31:33,655
Aah!

512
00:31:42,991 --> 00:31:44,556
Fascinating.

513
00:31:45,511 --> 00:31:47,192
Completely.

514
00:31:47,217 --> 00:31:48,822
Fascinating.

515
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,880
I have put that

516
00:31:52,905 --> 00:31:54,905
on hundreds of people.

517
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:58,961
And there is never
anything left, any, nothing.

518
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:04,336
But William...

519
00:32:05,286 --> 00:32:07,922
There's still plenty
of you in there isn't there?

520
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:10,774
Something's different.

521
00:32:12,016 --> 00:32:15,249
It is? What? What's different?

522
00:32:15,444 --> 00:32:17,444
It's changed.

523
00:32:18,421 --> 00:32:20,421
It's stronger.

524
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,445
More vicious.

525
00:32:24,463 --> 00:32:25,719
I'm sorry.

526
00:32:26,852 --> 00:32:29,304
I'm sorry. I don't
want to see you in pain.

527
00:32:31,545 --> 00:32:33,467
You and I, Bill,

528
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,959
we share a mission.

529
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,413
I'm not going to have a mission.
-Yeah.

530
00:32:39,437 --> 00:32:41,342
Yes, you do.

531
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:43,881
Oh, but you do have a mission.

532
00:32:43,905 --> 00:32:47,090
That same creature that contacted you

533
00:32:47,114 --> 00:32:49,372
contacted us. Do you know when, Bill?

534
00:32:49,396 --> 00:32:53,989
One thousand three hundred
and sixty-five years ago.

535
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:59,123
And we have been trying
to return the call ever since.

536
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:02,538
We can help each other.

537
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:04,562
Then...

538
00:33:04,586 --> 00:33:07,486
we can help you
find the proof that you need.

539
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:11,970
I don't need anybody to find proof.

540
00:33:13,376 --> 00:33:15,633
I just want it to stop.

541
00:33:16,133 --> 00:33:18,524
I know, I know,

542
00:33:18,548 --> 00:33:21,488
I understand. We
can help you.

543
00:33:23,309 --> 00:33:25,309
Where is it, Bill?

544
00:33:27,263 --> 00:33:28,911
Is it with Joe Sullivan?

545
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:31,779
It's not with anybody.

546
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:35,521
OK.

547
00:33:35,553 --> 00:33:38,177
Come on. Come
on, William.

548
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:41,275
I feel like I'm being
much more honest

549
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,578
with you than you are
with me right now.

550
00:33:43,602 --> 00:33:45,602
He'll hurt anybody.

551
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:48,078
Erase anybody.

552
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:07,483
So, Bill, what are we
going to see out here tonight?

553
00:34:08,287 --> 00:34:10,022
Fluctuations in the sky.

554
00:34:10,413 --> 00:34:14,179
Colors are ripples as it
bursts through the sky's atmosphere.

555
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:17,943
This energy is traveling
1,500 miles a second.

556
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:21,920
and almost 500 million
miles to get to us, and when it hits,

557
00:34:21,945 --> 00:34:24,347
Ugh. Ugh..

558
00:34:24,372 --> 00:34:25,400
Bill?

559
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:26,501
Ugh.

560
00:34:26,526 --> 00:34:27,663
Bill, are you alright?

561
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:29,687
Ugh,- there is something
out there. -Ugh,

562
00:34:30,191 --> 00:34:31,402
I think it...

563
00:34:32,527 --> 00:34:34,090
Oh, my God, Bill, look.

564
00:34:35,229 --> 00:34:37,840
Oh! Look. Look at it, Bill.

565
00:34:38,528 --> 00:34:42,220
Look. Seriously.
What's happening, Bill?

566
00:34:52,034 --> 00:34:53,519
What's happened?

567
00:34:53,823 --> 00:34:56,393
-They're here. I can feel them.
Who's here?

568
00:34:57,394 --> 00:34:59,728
Bill, who's here?

569
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:02,409
They found me. And
they've come back.

570
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,610
What are you saying?
-Look. Look. You see?

571
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:08,416
Don't you see?
-Please, just tell me.

572
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,584
Tell me what I'm
looking at here.

573
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,920
Look...I told you.

574
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:16,504
They didn't believe me.

575
00:35:22,406 --> 00:35:24,139
Platoon. It's coming.

576
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,381
Look. Come on.

577
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:29,229
Up there. It's...It's...
Follow, follow me, follow.

578
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:31,254
Look.

579
00:35:41,904 --> 00:35:42,999
No.

580
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:47,452
No! Bill, don't.

581
00:35:47,452 --> 00:35:49,452
Bill.

582
00:35:49,477 --> 00:35:50,836
-Bill...
-Shh!

583
00:35:50,861 --> 00:35:52,085
Bill, wait!

584
00:35:52,806 --> 00:35:53,884
Wait!

585
00:35:55,313 --> 00:35:56,492
Wait!

586
00:35:56,517 --> 00:35:59,698
Wait. Wait.
Bill, I don't know where I'm going.

587
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,558
Bill...

588
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:04,231
Shit!

589
00:36:04,256 --> 00:36:05,350
Joe!

590
00:36:06,268 --> 00:36:07,496
Over here!

591
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:40,020
Hang on, Bill.

592
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:44,958
My God!

593
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,771
Look at this!

594
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:11,701
Oh...

595
00:37:12,453 --> 00:37:14,760
Look! Over here, too.

596
00:37:14,784 --> 00:37:15,953
My God!

597
00:37:19,384 --> 00:37:20,452
Oh...

598
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:07,583
Oh, my God!

599
00:38:13,841 --> 00:38:15,934
Don't get too close, Bill.

600
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,825
Oh...

601
00:38:35,695 --> 00:38:36,806
Bill!

602
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,032
Run.

603
00:38:39,056 --> 00:38:40,234
Run!

604
00:38:41,031 --> 00:38:42,476
Bill! Bill!

605
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:44,500
Shit!

606
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:54,826
Bill, I need you to tell me

607
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:58,230
what it is we are
 looking at here.

608
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,769
What do you think
you are looking at?

609
00:39:02,364 --> 00:39:05,856
William, I'm going to
ask you one more time.

610
00:39:08,255 --> 00:39:10,255
Tell me what it is
that you found there.

611
00:39:20,105 --> 00:39:22,229
Is this some sort of
game you're playing

612
00:39:22,254 --> 00:39:24,067
to get people to
believe your story?

613
00:39:25,872 --> 00:39:27,872
Spray paint, cardboard,

614
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:30,012
camera tricks, and
post on-line for your

615
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:31,966
conspiracy buddies.
is that what this is?

616
00:39:32,684 --> 00:39:35,661
Or are we looking at something
significant here?

617
00:39:35,662 --> 00:39:36,671
Yeah.

618
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:39,286
It's significant.

619
00:39:40,683 --> 00:39:43,730
If you are fucking with me

620
00:39:43,754 --> 00:39:45,446
I will make sure you
leave this building

621
00:39:45,471 --> 00:39:48,885
cut up into a thousand pieces,
burned and pissed on.

622
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:54,681
I haven't much option
here. Sounds like I'm losing.

623
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:17,432
All units...

624
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,905
we have significant evidence
to indicate that

625
00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:22,071
an unidentified flying object has

626
00:40:22,096 --> 00:40:26,567
split apart in our atmosphere and
crashed onto Cassidy's property.

627
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:31,607
A small pod has landed in the

628
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:34,482
forest and the main
unit is in the pod.

629
00:40:36,174 --> 00:40:37,763
Find me this ship.

630
00:40:44,091 --> 00:40:46,091
We're going to fucking die
out here.

631
00:40:46,115 --> 00:40:48,855
Shut your mouth, soldier.

632
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:51,551
Move quickly and quietly.

633
00:41:02,284 --> 00:41:04,284
Appears to be a...substance

634
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,876
similar to what we saw at the truck.
-OK, sample it for the lab.

635
00:41:09,603 --> 00:41:10,900
We got something.

636
00:41:13,587 --> 00:41:15,587
The impact is obvious.

637
00:41:17,432 --> 00:41:19,220
Seven touchdown.

638
00:41:20,197 --> 00:41:22,564
So that's it? That's the
second crash site.

639
00:41:22,588 --> 00:41:25,687
Find the pod.
-Surrounding area is burnt.

640
00:41:26,148 --> 00:41:27,711
There's nothing left.

641
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,735
There's no ship.

642
00:41:29,759 --> 00:41:31,372
No pod. Nothing.

643
00:41:33,466 --> 00:41:37,278
You see what we see? There's nothing
here. I repeat, nothing is here.

644
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:40,028
We need to move on.

645
00:41:40,502 --> 00:41:42,330
No, that's...that's the right site.

646
00:41:42,355 --> 00:41:43,901
Doctor, there is no fucking ship.

647
00:41:43,925 --> 00:41:46,776
Something must have come and gone.
Open your god damned eyes.

648
00:41:46,811 --> 00:41:48,811
Ah!

649
00:41:49,664 --> 00:41:51,518
Bill?

650
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,416
Bill!

651
00:41:56,281 --> 00:41:57,617
Oh,Jesus!

652
00:41:57,618 --> 00:41:59,295
No yelling.

653
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,695
Oh, God. Sorry.

654
00:42:04,109 --> 00:42:06,109
Oh, let's see whats happening

655
00:42:08,545 --> 00:42:10,248
There's something out there.

656
00:42:10,273 --> 00:42:12,273
You're fucking...what?

657
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,925
I see...I see it.

658
00:42:17,566 --> 00:42:19,011
What is it, Bill?

659
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:21,035
Bill?

660
00:42:21,985 --> 00:42:23,192
Bill, what is it?

661
00:42:25,568 --> 00:42:26,675
Look!

662
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,700
Shh...Bill!

663
00:42:28,724 --> 00:42:29,905
Wait!

664
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,201
Bill!

665
00:42:31,224 --> 00:42:32,239
Bill!

666
00:42:37,377 --> 00:42:38,512
It's erased.

667
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,309
Bill...

668
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,130
No...No...

669
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:07,740
What the fuck is that?

670
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:11,756
I'm gonna shit my pants, man.

671
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,414
What the fuck was that?

672
00:43:18,479 --> 00:43:19,758
Did you see it?

673
00:43:30,628 --> 00:43:31,771
I don't know, Joe.

674
00:43:45,742 --> 00:43:47,742
Bill, Bill, wait!

675
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:48,447
Wait, wait!

676
00:43:48,472 --> 00:43:50,512
-I knew you had a
goddamned camera.

677
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,212
Bill?

678
00:44:02,942 --> 00:44:04,174
Ah!

679
00:44:11,902 --> 00:44:13,148
Ah!

680
00:44:20,289 --> 00:44:21,612
Bill!

681
00:44:24,798 --> 00:44:26,206
Bill!

682
00:44:34,602 --> 00:44:35,868
Bill!

683
00:44:40,292 --> 00:44:43,461
Move...fucking move. Shit!

684
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,360
Oh, fuck. Move!

685
00:45:07,385 --> 00:45:08,885
I don't want to die.

686
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:11,376
Fuck! Oh, shit!

687
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,400
Oh...Ah...

688
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:15,587
Where...where am
I going?

689
00:45:15,611 --> 00:45:17,116
Where am I going? Fuck.

690
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,140
What the...?

691
00:45:19,853 --> 00:45:21,164
Ow!

692
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:30,728
Shit! The light!

693
00:45:35,752 --> 00:45:38,334
Oh, oh, fuck.
What is this?

694
00:45:38,358 --> 00:45:39,646
What the...what the fuck?

695
00:45:41,687 --> 00:45:42,968
Things are about to get

696
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:44,108
very nasty right now.

697
00:45:56,177 --> 00:45:59,226
We don't really know
what they were originally designed for

698
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:03,406
All I know, is that they
cause immense pain.

699
00:46:04,781 --> 00:46:07,758
And shut off your body's
coping mechanism.

700
00:46:09,149 --> 00:46:11,258
Your body's designed
to shut off.

701
00:46:11,945 --> 00:46:13,945
But with the D-83 shackles,

702
00:46:15,282 --> 00:46:17,282
It keeps the pain switch
turned on.

703
00:46:28,067 --> 00:46:29,476
It's your last chance.

704
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,591
Where is that ship?

705
00:46:40,614 --> 00:46:41,763
Turn it on!

706
00:46:46,799 --> 00:46:49,214
Yeah, you want to
tell me where the ship is now, Bill?

707
00:46:52,928 --> 00:46:54,408
You had enough now?

708
00:46:59,266 --> 00:47:00,293
Hey, you want more?

709
00:47:04,285 --> 00:47:06,285
Come on, Agent! Turn it
up! Give him more!

710
00:47:13,528 --> 00:47:20,558
Ahh! Ahh! Ahhh!
Ahhh! Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh

711
00:47:31,924 --> 00:47:34,433
You're gonna need more
power than that!

712
00:47:50,928 --> 00:47:52,064
Hey!

713
00:47:56,234 --> 00:47:57,288
Bill?

714
00:47:58,078 --> 00:47:59,312
Bill?

715
00:47:59,969 --> 00:48:01,094
Bill, come on.

716
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,227
Is it out there?

717
00:48:02,251 --> 00:48:04,031
Oh, please don't be out there.

718
00:48:04,055 --> 00:48:05,443
Oh, fuck.

719
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:07,177
Oh, shit.

720
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,560
Weird. Oh. Oh.

721
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:11,583
I'll just...I'll just...

722
00:48:11,608 --> 00:48:15,881
OK, OK, OK. OK. Ok.

723
00:48:17,374 --> 00:48:18,757
That's just me.

724
00:48:19,466 --> 00:48:20,781
It's fine.

725
00:48:25,044 --> 00:48:26,656
Oh, fuck! Oh, God!

726
00:48:33,213 --> 00:48:35,218
Why are running?
You running away?

727
00:48:35,242 --> 00:48:36,862
Gotta get way back to the cam.

728
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,518
Up the stairs.

729
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,542
Shit! get the door!

730
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,348
That's not enough!

731
00:48:49,362 --> 00:48:50,372
Oh, shit.

732
00:49:01,799 --> 00:49:03,482
Bill? Bill!

733
00:49:04,092 --> 00:49:05,506
Take the camera!

734
00:49:10,499 --> 00:49:12,499
-Look!
-The shelf!

735
00:49:20,672 --> 00:49:21,887
The noise.

736
00:49:23,278 --> 00:49:25,278
Bill, what's that on
the fucking roof?

737
00:49:27,653 --> 00:49:29,652
Bill, how did they get on
the roof?

738
00:49:30,352 --> 00:49:31,677
Oh, fuck!

739
00:49:39,111 --> 00:49:41,360
Son of a bitch!

740
00:49:59,462 --> 00:50:01,999
It's back. At the car site.

741
00:50:02,023 --> 00:50:04,023
Back up, back up!

742
00:50:04,047 --> 00:50:06,047
Ahhhhhh!

743
00:50:06,072 --> 00:50:08,072
Ah! Ah!

744
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:11,284
You can do it.

745
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,614
Stevens!

746
00:50:12,637 --> 00:50:14,479
Ok, what happened, soldier?
I lost my feed.

747
00:50:14,504 --> 00:50:16,662
Something grabbed Stevens
at the grid.

748
00:50:16,686 --> 00:50:18,686
Stevens!!!!

749
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:20,710
Anybody got eyes on him?

750
00:50:20,734 --> 00:50:23,410
Go ahead into his last location.

751
00:50:23,434 --> 00:50:24,879
Did he say what he saw?

752
00:50:24,903 --> 00:50:28,388
Negative. All we heard was
too fucked up sound, then silence.

753
00:50:29,185 --> 00:50:32,224
It ain't human. It's got to
be extra-terrestrial.

754
00:50:32,248 --> 00:50:34,248
Stevens!!

755
00:50:34,272 --> 00:50:37,973
Stay close. keep your
eyes open.

756
00:50:37,997 --> 00:50:40,309
Stevens! Stevens.

757
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:42,333
Stevens. Stevens!

758
00:50:52,197 --> 00:50:54,197
Got a bunch of them live.

759
00:50:56,247 --> 00:50:57,767
Stevens is gone.

760
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:00,947
Fuck!

761
00:51:01,661 --> 00:51:02,971
Tracks.

762
00:51:06,812 --> 00:51:08,812
That side...

763
00:51:12,213 --> 00:51:13,508
Both of you.

764
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:18,827
Ok, keep following. I want
you to find something,

765
00:51:19,472 --> 00:51:20,528
 Find some answers here.

766
00:51:37,117 --> 00:51:38,463
Nothing for a while.

767
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:40,893
It's been about an hour.

768
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:44,496
I was thinking...I think
he's gone.

769
00:51:48,644 --> 00:51:50,644
Nothing's moved out there.

770
00:51:50,668 --> 00:51:52,067
I don't know.

771
00:51:54,424 --> 00:51:55,981
What are we gonna do?

772
00:51:59,285 --> 00:52:01,314
I just want to be backing
off that truck and

773
00:52:01,339 --> 00:52:02,541
getting the fuck out of here.

774
00:52:02,566 --> 00:52:04,566
Yeah, well, just stay put.

775
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:08,136
I'll haunt after daylight.

776
00:52:09,485 --> 00:52:10,995
Huh..

777
00:52:12,614 --> 00:52:13,847
We got a gun.

778
00:52:16,176 --> 00:52:17,699
If we could see it,
we can shoot it.

779
00:52:28,803 --> 00:52:30,715
It's just you and
me in the end of the world.

780
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:35,375
Uh...

781
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,676
Yeah.

782
00:52:39,082 --> 00:52:41,082
Let's get out of here.

783
00:52:44,266 --> 00:52:45,645
Ok.

784
00:52:56,476 --> 00:52:58,476
It's a fucking light!

785
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,156
Jesus freaking Christ.

786
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:25,128
Clear.

787
00:53:25,153 --> 00:53:26,292
Yeah.

788
00:53:27,344 --> 00:53:29,344
Where is the truck keys?

789
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:31,369
What? Wait a minute, truck keys?

790
00:53:32,721 --> 00:53:34,721
What the hell does it look like?

791
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:36,745
Ahh!

792
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:41,691
Jesus, fuckin bullshit!

793
00:53:41,692 --> 00:53:42,728
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

794
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:44,326
Where's the gun?

795
00:53:44,351 --> 00:53:46,843
It...it...it  bounced out of my hand.
I don't know.

796
00:53:46,844 --> 00:53:48,052
Did you forget?

797
00:53:48,077 --> 00:53:50,077
Maybe...I don't know.

798
00:53:50,834 --> 00:53:52,834
What about the roof?

799
00:53:53,873 --> 00:53:55,873
Bill!
Here!

800
00:53:55,897 --> 00:53:57,897
Here, over here!

801
00:53:59,894 --> 00:54:02,021
Can that thing get through
that fucking bed?

802
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:05,076
Ok! Move! hey!

803
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,896
One...two...three...

804
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,920
Fuck it!

805
00:54:11,634 --> 00:54:13,845
3...2...1! The door!

806
00:54:17,145 --> 00:54:19,145
We can't stay here.

807
00:54:19,169 --> 00:54:21,169
Where else are we gonna go?

808
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:49,188
It's gone.

809
00:55:21,705 --> 00:55:22,890
Bill!

810
00:55:22,914 --> 00:55:24,127
I fucked my ankle.

811
00:55:24,151 --> 00:55:26,478
No, no, no,no...move...

812
00:55:33,569 --> 00:55:36,028
Got them...?
Not on one key

813
00:55:36,029 --> 00:55:37,710
What does it look like?

814
00:55:37,735 --> 00:55:39,735
I'm gonna get the gun.
No! No!

815
00:55:39,759 --> 00:55:41,759
Don't do that. Bill, don't, don't...

816
00:55:41,783 --> 00:55:44,252
No, Bill. Don't leave me with
that thing .

817
00:55:44,276 --> 00:55:47,431
Bill, Bill! please!

818
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,455
Please! Please!

819
00:55:50,048 --> 00:55:51,275
Fuck!

820
00:55:51,299 --> 00:55:52,287
Shit!

821
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:55,529
Bill, Bill.
-Shh!

822
00:55:55,553 --> 00:55:57,553
Bill!
-Shh!

823
00:56:03,744 --> 00:56:05,044
Where did it go?

824
00:56:05,068 --> 00:56:07,068
It was crawling right there.

825
00:56:07,091 --> 00:56:09,091
Ok, let's get out of here!

826
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,918
Hold on...
-No. Let's go!

827
00:56:11,941 --> 00:56:14,113
I think it's dead.
Dead?

828
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:17,641
What? What?
It was bleeding very loud

829
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:21,059
and it collapsed though there.

830
00:56:21,082 --> 00:56:23,863
It stopped.
Ok, great.

831
00:56:23,887 --> 00:56:25,710
That's fucking cool.

832
00:56:25,735 --> 00:56:27,735
Wait there.
No.

833
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,108
No. No, fuck you.

834
00:56:31,327 --> 00:56:33,327
Uh! Ah!

835
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:09,119
We have confirmation of contact.

836
00:57:09,996 --> 00:57:11,143
Yes.

837
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:14,494
A video recording, sir.

838
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:18,033
I'm going to see it now.

839
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,305
You have my full
understanding, sir.

840
00:57:26,962 --> 00:57:28,500
I will be waiting your arrival.

841
00:57:47,259 --> 00:57:49,259
Fuck, come on, Bill!

842
00:57:49,284 --> 00:57:50,812
Bill, Bill, where are you?

843
00:57:54,031 --> 00:57:56,031
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

844
00:57:57,813 --> 00:57:59,813
Oh....

845
00:57:59,837 --> 00:58:02,322
Ah! Ah!

846
00:58:02,347 --> 00:58:03,622
Bill!

847
00:58:04,136 --> 00:58:05,307
Bill!

848
00:58:05,331 --> 00:58:07,714
Oh! Bill, Bill!!

849
00:58:07,739 --> 00:58:10,245
You've got to see this!

850
00:58:10,284 --> 00:58:12,284
What? What?

851
00:58:12,309 --> 00:58:14,309
Who's in your camera?

852
00:58:16,184 --> 00:58:18,184
What are you doing?

853
00:58:18,208 --> 00:58:19,394
Come here.

854
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:21,730
My god!

855
00:58:32,785 --> 00:58:34,202
Hello?

856
00:58:35,535 --> 00:58:37,140
Who are you?

857
00:58:44,322 --> 00:58:45,699
I knew it was you!

858
00:58:48,257 --> 00:58:50,257
I've been waiting.

859
00:58:52,847 --> 00:58:55,441
Please, I...I'm needing help.

860
00:58:58,845 --> 00:59:00,845
Destroy them. I'm...
I'm nothing.

861
00:59:02,353 --> 00:59:04,353
I'm nothing!

862
00:59:05,531 --> 00:59:07,531
Ahhhh!

863
00:59:07,555 --> 00:59:09,555
Ahhh! Ahhh!

864
00:59:10,509 --> 00:59:12,509
Enough with the screaming already.

865
00:59:15,337 --> 00:59:16,157
It doesn't matter now.

866
00:59:16,182 --> 00:59:18,344
I've contacted council.
They will be here

867
00:59:18,369 --> 00:59:19,985
in a matter of hours.

868
00:59:21,743 --> 00:59:24,154
You'll be in their hands now
and let me tell you, Bill,

869
00:59:24,178 --> 00:59:26,458
their hands are a lot
 rougher than mine.

870
00:59:29,029 --> 00:59:31,029
We're moving...we've got some sound...

871
00:59:35,422 --> 00:59:37,422
It's here.

872
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:40,274
creature is here.

873
00:59:42,007 --> 00:59:44,359
No! Hold your fire!

874
00:59:44,383 --> 00:59:46,273
Hold your fire, god damn it!

875
00:59:46,297 --> 00:59:48,297
Fucking idiots!

876
00:59:50,891 --> 00:59:53,752
You fucking chicken
shit morons!

877
00:59:54,714 --> 00:59:57,088
Don't just stand there
staring! Go get them.

878
00:59:59,151 --> 01:00:00,862
Toggle that.

879
01:00:01,402 --> 01:00:02,886
Fuck me.

880
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:07,449
There's a man.

881
01:00:09,379 --> 01:00:11,379
He's pretty fucked up.

882
01:00:12,715 --> 01:00:15,210
He's gotten the same substance
as the crash site.

883
01:00:15,234 --> 01:00:18,422
Oh, my God, I don't
 believe it. That's...

884
01:00:18,446 --> 01:00:20,031
That's Joe Sullivan.

885
01:00:20,055 --> 01:00:23,453
Repeat. Same substance from the truck.

886
01:00:23,477 --> 01:00:25,477
And at the crash sight.

887
01:00:25,501 --> 01:00:26,839
Is he alive?

888
01:00:29,698 --> 01:00:31,308
He'll survive.

889
01:00:32,058 --> 01:00:34,058
Bring him to me now.

890
01:00:34,735 --> 01:00:35,903
Copy.

891
01:00:41,514 --> 01:00:43,514
Did you hear that, William?

892
01:00:44,748 --> 01:00:46,748
We're going to have a guest.

893
01:01:53,146 --> 01:01:55,146
You sure it's dead?

894
01:01:55,388 --> 01:01:57,388
It's not breathing.

895
01:02:27,813 --> 01:02:29,813
Uh, Bill...

896
01:02:29,837 --> 01:02:32,591
We should...We should
call someone.

897
01:02:34,497 --> 01:02:36,497
You focus on what you're doing.

898
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,200
Listen...What is that?

899
01:02:48,738 --> 01:02:50,906
Whoa! Oh!

900
01:02:50,939 --> 01:02:53,427
Get the tape! Run!

901
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:57,904
Bill.

902
01:02:58,725 --> 01:02:59,928
Hey Bill.

903
01:03:00,807 --> 01:03:02,186
Why don't we call the cops?

904
01:03:02,736 --> 01:03:04,210
No,we should...

905
01:03:04,235 --> 01:03:06,137
We call the cops
and they can come

906
01:03:06,162 --> 01:03:08,039
and then they can
call whenever and

907
01:03:08,071 --> 01:03:10,377
We can call the army and the national guard

908
01:03:10,402 --> 01:03:12,997
This isn't right. I need
we need  the new suppliers.

909
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:14,331
Wow...

910
01:03:14,356 --> 01:03:16,356
Shit. I don't feel good.

911
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,067
I wanna go home.

912
01:03:18,092 --> 01:03:20,512
Yeah...I wanna go home.
Bill, there's something wrong.

913
01:03:20,536 --> 01:03:24,387
Can you focus for a goddamned second?

914
01:03:25,247 --> 01:03:26,496
Good.

915
01:03:35,695 --> 01:03:37,657
-I saw that.
-I'm sorry.

916
01:03:37,712 --> 01:03:39,712
Will you clean that
shit up?

917
01:03:40,575 --> 01:03:41,915
What?

918
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,680
What are you talking about?

919
01:03:45,704 --> 01:03:48,798
- Clean that shit up!
-I'm sorry, Bill.

920
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:52,049
Bill. Bill!

921
01:03:53,783 --> 01:03:57,361
Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe. Joe. Joe.
Shit!

922
01:03:57,869 --> 01:04:00,947
-Fuck...
-I'm sorry about that.

923
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:04,292
Before...the police...the camera.

924
01:04:04,659 --> 01:04:06,799
Is all in here. Cassidy, Bill.

925
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:07,712
Shh...

926
01:04:07,737 --> 01:04:09,737
This is his.

927
01:04:09,761 --> 01:04:11,439
It's so important.

928
01:04:11,837 --> 01:04:13,837
You're going to get the camera.

929
01:04:14,173 --> 01:04:16,173
And then you are gonna operate it.

930
01:04:16,197 --> 01:04:18,197
And I want you to see this. Are
you ready?

931
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:20,221
Come. Come closer.

932
01:04:20,245 --> 01:04:21,874
Over here. Come on.

933
01:04:22,538 --> 01:04:23,710
Look.

934
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:25,060
Look at this. Look.

935
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:27,085
See?

936
01:04:27,108 --> 01:04:29,755
Isn't it lovable?
It's good.

937
01:04:30,998 --> 01:04:32,998
The same thing that's
 inside of here

938
01:04:33,022 --> 01:04:35,022
is inside of me

939
01:04:35,593 --> 01:04:38,180
There's something bigger 
controlling us both.

940
01:04:44,427 --> 01:04:46,427
And I've got you.

941
01:04:49,288 --> 01:04:50,623
What's that?

942
01:04:50,811 --> 01:04:52,460
What?

943
01:04:52,484 --> 01:04:54,484
What's that? What's going on?

944
01:04:55,885 --> 01:04:57,273
We gotta go!

945
01:05:04,969 --> 01:05:06,087
Look.

946
01:05:08,867 --> 01:05:10,867
I got a visual! There he is!

947
01:05:10,892 --> 01:05:13,159
Target's on me. Take them!
take them!

948
01:05:13,183 --> 01:05:14,970
Target's on you. Go! Go!

949
01:05:14,995 --> 01:05:16,995
Pull out! Pull out!

950
01:05:24,022 --> 01:05:25,511
in time, men.

951
01:05:27,472 --> 01:05:29,472
It's on you!

952
01:05:43,953 --> 01:05:45,574
My name is Joseph Sullivan.

953
01:05:45,598 --> 01:05:48,392
What you've just seen is 100

954
01:05:59,474 --> 01:06:01,994
That's not exactly how you
thought it would end, huh?

955
01:06:03,871 --> 01:06:05,510
Don't worry, William.

956
01:06:05,534 --> 01:06:08,230
That's not the end for you.

957
01:06:08,254 --> 01:06:11,895
It's just the start of a long life.

958
01:06:11,919 --> 01:06:13,919
Locked up in a cage...

959
01:06:13,943 --> 01:06:15,979
squealing like a dog

960
01:06:16,003 --> 01:06:18,487
while they stuff you like a pig.

961
01:06:20,917 --> 01:06:22,917
I'm not afraid of you.

962
01:06:49,769 --> 01:06:51,173
What do you want?

963
01:06:52,498 --> 01:06:53,696
You!

964
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:56,490
do...suffer!

965
01:06:58,142 --> 01:07:01,243
We will find you!

966
01:07:02,789 --> 01:07:04,267
No you won't.

967
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:06,916
We are in a heavily 
guarded facility here.

968
01:07:07,727 --> 01:07:11,727
You brought us!

969
01:07:14,688 --> 01:07:17,090
Listen to me, you
cocky fuck!

970
01:07:18,462 --> 01:07:21,790
We ripped apart your
granddaddy in the sixties

971
01:07:22,587 --> 01:07:25,455
We'll rip apart you
just the same!

972
01:07:26,121 --> 01:07:29,541
You will suffer

973
01:07:29,565 --> 01:07:31,565
most!

974
01:07:49,048 --> 01:07:53,587
You will suffer most!!!

975
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:07,449
We're approaching the facility
with Joe Sullivan.

976
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:11,027
He's not conscious. 
I hope you're ready for this.

977
01:08:12,023 --> 01:08:13,363
Aboart!

978
01:08:13,387 --> 01:08:16,015
Aboart! Do not bring
Joe Sullivan here!

979
01:08:16,562 --> 01:08:18,562
Kill subject immediately.

980
01:08:22,856 --> 01:08:24,617
Do not bring him here!

981
01:08:28,529 --> 01:08:29,841
Kill him!

982
01:08:55,905 --> 01:08:57,637
There's been a breach!

983
01:08:58,449 --> 01:09:00,449
Officer! Let him locked out!

984
01:09:53,067 --> 01:09:54,340
What happened?

985
01:10:03,953 --> 01:10:05,359
They're here.

986
01:10:26,517 --> 01:10:28,921
Please...let me go...

987
01:10:31,413 --> 01:10:32,796
Help me.

988
01:10:33,781 --> 01:10:35,781
What do I do? Tell me.

989
01:10:36,744 --> 01:10:39,643
Please, I don't want to die.

990
01:10:42,679 --> 01:10:44,268
They won't let you die.

991
01:10:48,124 --> 01:10:49,721
Please tell me something.

992
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,256
Something that you know.

993
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:52,413
Please.

994
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:55,882
I know they're like me.

995
01:10:56,999 --> 01:11:00,838
They may be something more
than is humanly possible.

996
01:11:02,245 --> 01:11:05,198
I can't imagine what 
they'll do to you.

997
01:11:21,067 --> 01:11:23,067
I guess it's over.

998
01:12:35,256 --> 01:12:36,486
Please...

999
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:38,924
Take it up.

1000
01:12:40,373 --> 01:12:41,494
Make it stop.

1001
01:12:46,169 --> 01:12:47,737
Make it end.

1002
01:12:49,503 --> 01:12:50,853
I'm begging you.

1003
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:31,177
Well...

1004
01:14:32,654 --> 01:14:35,019
Congratulations, internet.

1005
01:14:35,043 --> 01:14:36,316
You win.

1006
01:14:36,558 --> 01:14:38,558
You deep dulled Sully.

1007
01:14:40,527 --> 01:14:42,527
I drove for fourteen hours

1008
01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:44,863
To an address

1009
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:47,608
that did not have Spider Nevy

1010
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:52,194
I didn't even see the abducter. So...

1011
01:14:53,319 --> 01:14:56,789
All in all, it ends to an epic fail.

1012
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:01,039
I promised you guys a white whale and...

1013
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:05,286
I give you nothing. All I've got to
show for is this headache. So...

1014
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:10,060
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

1015
01:15:15,224 --> 01:15:17,224
I'll get back after it tomorrow.

1016
01:17:37,168 --> 01:17:39,980
Hello everybody. My name
is Ashley Winnington-Ball

1017
01:17:40,005 --> 01:17:43,092
and today we're going to
look directly at the sun.

1018
01:17:43,116 --> 01:17:46,137
mass coronal ejection.

1019
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:48,207
Sounds odd, huh?

1020
01:17:48,231 --> 01:17:49,591
As a matter of fact it is.
