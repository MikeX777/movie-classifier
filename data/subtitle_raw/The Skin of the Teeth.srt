1
00:00:02,081 --> 00:00:02,752
(film reel whirring)

2
00:00:02,881 --> 00:00:05,236
(chimes jingling)

3
00:00:05,361 --> 00:00:07,875
(shining music)

4
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,279
{ominous music)

5
00:00:21,401 --> 00:00:23,597
(horn honking)

6
00:00:23,721 --> 00:00:26,235
(door clicking)

7
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:41,798
(sighs)

8
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:51,995
(pills rattling)

9
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:40,916
(door grating)

10
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,157
(sizzling)

11
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:42,320
(knocking)

12
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:43,397
- Just a minute.

13
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:47,401
(sirens wailing in the distance)

14
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:57,197
(posh music)

15
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:06,437
Hi.

16
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,596
- [Josef] Hi.

17
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:08,711
- Come on in.

18
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,317
- And uh, somebody let
me inside the building.

19
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:17,398
Uh, and I'm sorry I'm
late, but the trains were--

20
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:18,272
- No problem.

21
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:26,192
- This is a really nice place.

22
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,550
- Thanks.

23
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:29,354
- And, uh, 1, I brought some wine.

24
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:32,197
- Thank you.

25
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:34,073
- You're welcome.
- Very nice of you.

26
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:42,230
Can I take your jacket?

27
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:43,760
- (laughs) Yeah.

28
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:44,598
Yeah.

29
00:03:44,721 --> 00:03:46,394
- You know you're really very cute, Joe.

30
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:48,876
- Usually I don't like it
when people call me that.

31
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:50,435
<i>(Josef chuckles)
Uh, can 1 use your bathroom?</i>

32
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:51,596
- It's right in there.

33
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,315
(water sloshing)

34
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:13,317
(thudding)

35
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:40,435
Make yourself at home.

36
00:04:40,561 --> 00:04:41,881
I'll be ready in a minute.

37
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:45,753
(sophisticated music)

38
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:54,035
(knife grating)

39
00:05:01,161 --> 00:05:02,913
- Isn't it hard to find what you want?

40
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:09,479
- T like how it looks.

41
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:20,072
- This, uh, (laughs)

42
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:21,680
this feels all grown up.

43
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:22,916
(Josef laughs)
- Yeah.

44
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:26,192
Cheers.
- Cheers.

45
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:35,434
Oh, this is good. (laughs)

46
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:36,312
um,

47
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:42,200
and um, how long you been living here for?

48
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:43,072
- About five years.

49
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:43,872
- [Josef] Ah, (laughs)

50
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,594
I've only been here a year
and I already moved out twice.

51
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:46,552
- Uh-huh, T know how it goes, man.

52
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:49,321
<i>Twas like that when 1
first moved here too.</i>

53
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:51,193
Where did you say you were from again?

54
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:52,641
- Um, Murmage.

55
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:56,592
- Excuse me?

56
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:58,120
- [Josef] Murmage?

57
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:01,715
- I'love Murmage.

58
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,111
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

59
00:06:05,161 --> 00:06:06,276
I love to murmage.

60
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:07,914
I love murmaging.

61
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,600
There's nothing I love more

62
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:11,678
than a cold murmage on the Murmage.

63
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:13,553
(Josef laughs)

64
00:06:13,681 --> 00:06:16,241
That's just about Mississippi, actually.

65
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:19,114
Most of us only say our own
name, like uh, like Pokemon.

66
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:20,231
(John laughs)

67
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:22,875
Yeah. (laughs)

68
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:23,752
- How's the wine?

69
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:27,761
- It's way better than the
seven bucks I spent on it.

70
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:30,395
And uh, it's exactly
the right temperature.

71
00:06:33,121 --> 00:06:34,316
- Yours is in the fridge.

72
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,760
(Josef laughs)

73
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:43,114
- And um, is this your usual routine?

74
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:46,592
- (laughs) Excuse me?

75
00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:47,916
- [Josef] I mean, you know.

76
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,111
- [John] No.

77
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:50,117
- For dates.

78
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:50,912
- [John] Oh.

79
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:52,918
- For uh, guys who come in here.

80
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,076
- [John] Mm-hm.

81
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:55,919
- The, the, the food, the wine, the music,

82
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,156
I mean.
- Mm-hm, yeah.

83
00:06:57,281 --> 00:06:58,077
- It's good!

84
00:06:58,201 --> 00:06:58,872
(Josef laughs)

85
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,036
It is good.

86
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:02,038
I'm sorry, it's not a bad thing.

87
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:05,995
Um, I'm uh, (laughs) I'm feeling seduced.

88
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:08,874
(John and Josef laughing)

89
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:11,356
- Well, I'm not sure you can seduce

90
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,915
somebody you've already fucked.

91
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:17,560
Would you like some more wine?

92
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,198
- Yeah.

93
00:07:20,321 --> 00:07:21,550
- All right.

94
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:24,195
(elegant music)

95
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:33,116
(gentle music)

96
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:40,432
- I'm on the couch. (laughs)

97
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:42,552
- (laughs) Apparently.

98
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,080
Oh hey, hey, hey.

99
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:50,874
(glasses clinking)

100
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,077
(Josef chuckles)

101
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:06,239
- Okay, what's your deal, all right?

102
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,317
- I'm sorry?

103
00:08:07,441 --> 00:08:09,193
- I mean who, who are you?

104
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:13,280
1, I know who you are, I, I think.

105
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:15,438
<i>1, 1don't know, 1 was
pretty drunk that night.</i>

106
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,393
- I don't know, you seemed like
you were having a good time.

107
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:18,317
It was nice.

108
00:08:19,481 --> 00:08:20,710
- You live in the city.

109
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:22,275
Uh, you work at a hedge fund.

110
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,472
Blah, blah, and blah, that, that's boring.

111
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:26,638
I mean, that's really boring.

112
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:28,195
I wanna know the real you.

113
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:29,834
Like who are you?

114
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:30,917
What makes John tick?

115
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:37,032
- So young.

116
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:39,192
I don't know.

117
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:41,071
Why don't you start?

118
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:43,272
- All right.

119
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:47,353
I wanna change the world.

120
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:48,676
- From the reception desk?

121
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:50,872
- Whoa, hold on, I don't do that anymore.

122
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:52,753
1, I told you that?

123
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:54,394
T work in film now.

124
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:55,192
- Okay.

125
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:57,153
Okay, so, I guess, you know,

126
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:00,234
1 grew up in the middle of nowhere.

127
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:01,271
Right?

128
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:03,438
My parents were born there.

129
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:05,313
Their parents were born there.

130
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:07,720
Nobody ever left.

131
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:08,512
Ever wanted to leave,

132
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:10,951
ever thought of thinking of
leaving in the first place,

133
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:12,037
I think, I don't know.

134
00:09:12,161 --> 00:09:14,357
But I was different.

135
00:09:14,481 --> 00:09:16,552
But it still took me 20 years, really.

136
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,796
And um, now I'm here

137
00:09:17,921 --> 00:09:21,516
and I see all this hot, great mess,

138
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:24,155
and, and it makes you think differently.

139
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:27,592
It's um, one thing to know
something else is out there.

140
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:28,756
It's another to see it.

141
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,116
To feel it.
- Mm-hm.

142
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:34,513
- Damn, I don't know, man, I don't know.

143
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,440
I know I sound really naive or idealistic

144
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:38,835
or you know, whatever,

145
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:40,838
but that's why--
- Whatever, that's beautiful.

146
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:41,951
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

147
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:42,912
You're something, you know that?

148
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:43,792
(Josef laughs)

149
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:45,514
- Shut up, what about you?
- Seriously.

150
00:09:45,641 --> 00:09:46,995
(Josef laughs)
- What about me?

151
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:48,077
- Yeah.

152
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:49,157
- Ugh, I don't know.

153
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:51,591
- Whoa, whoa, come on, I (laughs)

154
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:53,712
I just sat here and told you my whole

155
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:55,878
you know, shebang, the whole thing.

156
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:57,321
You gotta give me something.

157
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:01,032
- Uh,

158
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:05,196
I guess,

159
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:10,033
for me, it's about the little things.

160
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:12,356
- What do you mean?

161
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:13,630
- What do you mean what do I mean?

162
00:10:13,761 --> 00:10:17,914
I mean the little things, I
mean like my stuff, my house.

163
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,998
My friends, my family,

164
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:24,319
having a me-shaped place in the world.

165
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:27,910
- [Josef] That's it?

166
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:28,712
- What do you mean that's it?

167
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:29,672
Yeah.

168
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:30,711
You're kind of a dick, Joe.

169
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:32,957
- Oh whoa, I mean, in a cute way right?

170
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:33,752
That's what matters. (laughs)

171
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:35,474
- You know you actually remind me

172
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,559
<i>of a guy 1 used to party
With back in the day.</i>

173
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:40,672
He was a lot of fun at
three in the morning.

174
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:43,832
(door rattling)

175
00:10:43,961 --> 00:10:46,316
- Um, what do you mean you
used to party with him?

176
00:10:48,201 --> 00:10:49,032
- [John] You know.

177
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,793
We went out sometimes.

178
00:10:53,201 --> 00:10:57,115
- Did you, um, did you
guys do stuff together?

179
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:59,755
- [John] Uh, yeah, we, uh, hooked up.

180
00:11:02,081 --> 00:11:05,153
- No, no, I mean, you know.

181
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:07,795
Did you guys take stuff together?

182
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:19,472
- Occasionally.

183
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:25,351
(wine sloshing)

184
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:27,757
I mean, you're young in the city,

185
00:11:27,881 --> 00:11:29,633
it seems like the obvious thing to do.

186
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:34,596
- I mean, yeah, tell me more, I wanna...

187
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:35,392
Like, what did you do?

188
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:37,000
Like, what was the best experience?

189
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,113
- Best part is

190
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,078
um, forgetting everything.

191
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:49,314
Everything heavy just falls away.

192
00:11:50,681 --> 00:11:51,955
And nothing is frightening.

193
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:55,152
And everything is possible.

194
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:57,640
Aside from that, you're not missing much.

195
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:00,275
- (laughs) Wow.

196
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:03,432
Wow, um, I think I left my phone upstairs.

197
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:05,598
You mind if I check if it's--

198
00:12:05,721 --> 00:12:06,597
- Sure, it's on the bed.

199
00:12:06,721 --> 00:12:07,472
- Thanks.

200
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,036
(gentle music)

201
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:28,515
(zipper whirring)

202
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:30,312
(Josef sighs)

203
00:12:30,441 --> 00:12:33,593
(melancholy rock music)

204
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:52,112
- [John] Did you find it?

205
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:53,276
- Yeah.

206
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:56,393
(dark shoegaze music)

207
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:22,601
I'm not feeling too great actually

208
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:25,600
you know, I think I might head...

209
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,392

- Do you, you make it often?

221
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:53,678

222
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:57,351

230
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:26,952
- Tall blond?

7 Woken it's time for
discussion I decide &

235
00:14:45,321 --> 00:14:50,031
- He's, uh, he's talking to
someone on the couch, uh,

236
00:14:51,401 --> 00:14:52,152
a guy.

237
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,714
It looks like he's getting intimate.

238
00:14:56,641 --> 00:14:57,392
- Is he hot?

239
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:00,120
Not the blond guy, the other guy.

240
00:15:02,881 --> 00:15:03,677
- Very.

241
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:07,112

<i>- Oh, Tdon't, uh, Tdon't
think 1 should keep watching.</i>

244
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:15,192
- Come on.

245
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:17,312

Um, they're getting closer.

248
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:29,237
Now they're kissing.

249
00:15:30,161 --> 00:15:32,038
Now the blond guy put his head up.

250
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,397
He just gave me a thumbs up!

251
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:36,272
What?

252
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:39,272
He lets you watch him?

253
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:40,277
- He watches me too!

254
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:43,833
Don't worry, not tonight, he's on a date.

255
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:48,951
(John laughs)

256
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,799
Relax, it's fine.

257
00:15:51,881 --> 00:15:52,757
It's New York.

258
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:55,031
I always assume everybody's watching.

259
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:56,117
- That kind of weirds me out.

260
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:58,232
I don't know.

261
00:15:58,361 --> 00:15:59,112
- I've nothing to hide.

262
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:02,711
- It's not about hiding, you
know, it's, it's about privacy.

263
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:06,440
- I bet you get embarrassed
kissing in public too.

264
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:12,158
I just assume these days
everybody has my information.

265
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,920
- That's different.

266
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:19,481
- Idon't know, I think,

267
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:22,070
there's a certain power

268
00:16:22,201 --> 00:16:24,317
to living out in the open, you know?

269
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,911
7 Would you take it off ;

270
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,190
- You want some more wine?

271
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:32,317
<i>1 mean, you barely touched
your chocolate cake.</i>

272
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:36,318
- You know, um...

- Are you okay?

286
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:11,919
(Josef grunts)

287
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:12,792
- Yeah, mm-hm.

288
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:15,832
- Josef.
- Hm?

289
00:17:15,961 --> 00:17:18,237
Huh?

290
00:17:18,361 --> 00:17:19,760
- What's going on?

291
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:24,921
- [Josef] Nothing. (laughs)

292
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:29,797
- Did you take something, Josef?

293
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:32,399
Josef, did you take something, Josef?

294
00:17:32,521 --> 00:17:34,319
- [Josef] Uh...

295
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:35,670
- What did you take?
- Uh--

296
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:36,791
- You need to tell me what you took.

297
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:40,994
- It was, uh, it was
small and, uh, and white.

298
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:43,954
- Did you find it in my bedroom?

299
00:17:45,361 --> 00:17:46,112
Fuck's sake.

300
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,274
You shouldn't have done that, Josef.

301
00:17:51,161 --> 00:17:51,832
That wasn't for you.

302
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:54,919
- I'm sorry, what's it for?

303
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,076
- [John] It's hard to explain.

304
00:17:57,121 --> 00:17:57,872
- I mean, what?

305
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,031
- It's experimental.

306
00:18:01,561 --> 00:18:02,881
- Cool.

307
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:06,073
(laughs) I don't know what that means.

308
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:07,271
- You're gonna be okay.

309
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:09,152
All right?

310
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:12,511
I'm gonna take care of you. (laughs)

311
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:14,512

00:18:31,761 --> 00:18:33,957
And, uh, I'm gonna get a drink.

320
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:35,276
- [Josef] Okay.

321
00:18:35,401 --> 00:18:36,880
- [John] Don't worry too much.

322
00:18:37,001 --> 00:18:38,594
Side effects shouldn't be too bad.

323
00:18:38,721 --> 00:18:39,552
You only took one.

324
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:48,315
(dreamlike music)

325
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:26,160
- Oh wow!
- All right.

326
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:29,239
- [Josef] You look, um, you look great.

327
00:19:29,361 --> 00:19:30,590
- You've seen me before.

328
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:31,597
- [Josef] (laughs) Oh no,
it was dark that night,

329
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:33,632
and it was, I couldn't see nothing.

330
00:19:33,761 --> 00:19:35,115
- You really don't remember
anything of that night,

331
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:35,912
sure you don't?

332
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,351
- [Josef] Um, not a single detail.

333
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:40,870
(laughs) Oh, did I do
anything embarrassing then?

334
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:41,672
- No.

335
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:43,599
No, it was cute actually,
you were having a good time.

336
00:19:43,721 --> 00:19:44,438
It was nice.

337
00:19:44,561 --> 00:19:45,232
- [Josef] Mm-hm.

338
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:46,431
Who were you texting?

339
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,750
- Somebody I had on backup.

340
00:19:49,881 --> 00:19:52,031
- Ah, okay.

341
00:19:52,161 --> 00:19:53,356

(Josef laughs)

345
00:19:56,801 --> 00:19:59,554
(expressive music)

346
00:20:46,881 --> 00:20:48,633
(Josef clears his throat)

347
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:50,399
(John chuckles)

348
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:51,272
Wow.

349
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:55,072
Yeah.

350
00:20:56,161 --> 00:20:56,992
It's the belt really, actually,

351
00:20:57,121 --> 00:20:59,476
that kind ties it all together, you know?

352
00:21:01,281 --> 00:21:03,557
- (laughs) I know, I know, right?

353
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:06,271
This song, it's good!

354
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:07,357
- You like this song?

355
00:21:09,081 --> 00:21:11,118
- Like it's, it's, it's, I
mean it's really good, like--

356
00:21:11,241 --> 00:21:12,072

- Yeah.

360
00:21:18,081 --> 00:21:19,151
- Let's dance.

361
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:20,872
Let's dance.

362
00:21:21,001 --> 00:21:23,515
(Josef giggles)

363
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:32,154
How could you be a worse dancer than I am?

364
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:34,113
- Huh, it's not loud enough.

365
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:38,396
- Fuck, Joe, Jesus!

366
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:40,792
That's stupid!

367
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:42,355
I have neighbors, you know.

368
00:21:42,481 --> 00:21:43,152
- Now it's too quiet.
- Okay!

369
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:45,795
All right, all right, all right.

370
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:48,438
- Yeah.
- Okay?

371
00:21:48,561 --> 00:21:49,312
- Yeah, that's good.
- You all right?

372
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:50,192
- Yeah.
- Feeling good?

373
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:52,119
- Feeling good.
- All, right, okay.

374
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:53,276
So now can you just--
- Huh?

375
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:55,233
- Okay, just like that, nice and slow.

376
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:56,192
All right?

377
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:57,436
Just follow my lead.

378
00:21:58,401 --> 00:21:59,835
All right.

379
00:21:59,961 --> 00:22:00,632
Nice and slow.

380
00:22:00,761 --> 00:22:03,230
(shadowy music)

381
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:06,560
(thudding)
Oh fuck!

382
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:11,119
- I'm so sorry, John, are you okay?

383
00:23:12,081 --> 00:23:13,640
You okay, hm?

384
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:15,399
(John groans)
Come on, John.

385
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:16,192
- I'm fine.

386
00:23:16,321 --> 00:23:17,800
- Okay, um--
- Ah!

387
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:18,717
- [Josef] I'm gonna get
you some ice, all right,

388
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:20,479
but you gotta get up first, come on.

389
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:22,080
- I'm okay, I'm all right.
- Okay okay okay.

390
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:23,794
- I'm all right.
- Come on, get up.

391
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:25,070
Get up, please.

392
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:27,277
Sit you down right here.

393
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:28,152
Okay?

394
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:36,914
John, come on, sit down.

395
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:41,112
You okay?

396
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:44,955
(heavy breathing)

397
00:23:46,121 --> 00:23:47,156
John?

398
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:50,751
(labored breathing)

399
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:52,952
(John cries out)

400
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:54,560
(heavy thudding)

401
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:56,115
Fuck!

402
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:57,561
(John grunts)

403
00:23:57,681 --> 00:24:00,275
(heavy thudding)

404
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:08,357
(body thuds)

405
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:40,638
(phone rings)

406
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:42,672
- [Dispatcher] 911, what's your emergency?

407
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:45,952
Hello?

408
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:48,832
Hello?

409
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:55,672
(pounding on the door)

410
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:56,552
- Hello?

411
00:24:56,681 --> 00:24:57,876
It's the police!

412
00:24:58,001 --> 00:24:59,116
(pounding on the door)

413
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:01,039
We received a noise complaint!

414
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:02,754
Please open the door!

415
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:03,951
(pounding on the door)

416
00:25:04,081 --> 00:25:05,674
Sir, we're gonna count to five

417
00:25:05,801 --> 00:25:09,556
and then we'll have to
force this door open.

418
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:10,432
Onel

419
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:13,072
Twol

420
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:15,638
Three!

421
00:25:17,441 --> 00:25:18,192
Four!

422
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:21,760
Five!

423
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:22,552
(door bangs)

424
00:25:22,681 --> 00:25:25,275
(troubled music)

425
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:28,994
(people murmuring)

426
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:39,715
(sirens wailing)

427
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:44,791
(chattering on police radio)

428
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:11,952
- Hey.

429
00:26:13,001 --> 00:26:13,957
Word of advice.

430
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:19,598
You act like you're guilty,
they're gonna treat you like it.

431
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:21,352
Understand?

432
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:00,916
- I'm Detective Locarno.

433
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:02,315
That's Detective Matthews.

434
00:27:24,321 --> 00:27:26,597
What's, ah--
- What,

435
00:27:26,721 --> 00:27:27,472
what time is it?

436
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:30,997
- It's a little after one.

437
00:27:31,121 --> 00:27:33,715
- (laughs) Okay.

438
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,031
- What's your name?

439
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:57,912
- Josef.

440
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:00,191
Uh, Josef King.

441
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:03,875
- How you feeling tonight, Joe?

442
00:28:04,001 --> 00:28:05,150
- I'm, I'm okay,

443
00:28:06,561 --> 00:28:07,312
I guess.

444
00:28:08,841 --> 00:28:09,512
- You want anything?

445
00:28:09,641 --> 00:28:11,314
You want, like, water or coffee?

446
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:12,192
- Ah, I'm okay.

447
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:14,792
Yeah.

448
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:20,792
- Can't imagine how you must
be feeling tonight, Joe--

449
00:28:20,921 --> 00:28:21,672
- Josef.

450
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:29,272
- Josef.

451
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,111
T know this must be hard for you

452
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:34,118
but I'm just gonna have to
ask you a couple questions.

453
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:35,151
All right?

454
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:36,794
- Yeah, I, I can do that, mm-hm.

455
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:40,235
- There's no wrong answers here, Joe.

456
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:43,035
Just need you to tell me
to the best of your ability

457
00:28:43,161 --> 00:28:44,390
exactly what happened tonight.

458
00:28:44,521 --> 00:28:45,875
Do you think you can do that?

459
00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:47,592
- Okay.

460
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:52,671
Um, I went on a date, all right?

461
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:55,270
Uh, we got a little dinner.

462
00:28:56,641 --> 00:28:57,711
Got a little drunk.

463
00:28:57,841 --> 00:28:59,559
Then we started to dance.

464
00:28:59,681 --> 00:29:02,195
And then he went crazy!

465
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:03,959
Uh, he started to,

466
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:14,754
started to scream, bashing
his head against the wall.

467
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:18,351
1 tried to help him, but
I didn't know what to do!

468
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:20,040
He kept doing it again and again,

469
00:29:20,161 --> 00:29:21,834
and then he wasn't moving anymore.

470
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:23,634
1 tried to call an ambulance, but

471
00:29:24,641 --> 00:29:25,836
I panicked.

472
00:29:25,961 --> 00:29:27,838
1, I didn't know what to do!

473
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:30,191
Uh, when the police showed up

474
00:29:30,321 --> 00:29:32,039
1, I didn't open the door because

475
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:33,560
I was scared that you might think

476
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:35,080
I had something to do with it.

477
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:36,718
- I see, okay.

478
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:39,793
Um, you're doing great, Joe.

479
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:40,638
Great job.

480
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:45,153
Um, how much did you
have to drink tonight?

481
00:29:55,201 --> 00:29:57,317
- Uh, a, a few glasses of wine.

482
00:29:57,441 --> 00:29:59,876
- Did you know that there
were psychoactive drugs

483
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:01,036
in the apartment?

484
00:30:04,321 --> 00:30:05,072
- What?

485
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:08,193
(laughs) Nah, nah, no.

486
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:09,072
Um,

487
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:10,872
psychoactive?

488
00:30:11,001 --> 00:30:11,797
- It's all right if you did!

489
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:12,638
It's all right if you did.

490
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:14,354
I just need to know exactly what happened.

491
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:15,710
-1, I didn't know that.

492
00:30:18,121 --> 00:30:18,838
- Good job, Joe.

493
00:30:18,961 --> 00:30:19,757
You're doing fine.

494
00:30:26,281 --> 00:30:27,680
- Am I under arrest?

495
00:30:27,801 --> 00:30:28,950
- No, not, not right now, no.

496
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:35,639
- Can I have some water?

497
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:36,557
- Not right now.

498
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:51,590
I'm gonna ask you to do
something for me, Josef.

499
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:00,276
It's totally within your
right to refuse to do this.

500
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:01,072
But if you do,

501
00:31:01,201 --> 00:31:04,159
I'm gonna have to start treating
you more like a suspect.

502
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:09,472
- Okay.

503
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:12,394
- T want to examine your clothing.

504
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:14,831
T want to just see if everything lines up,

505
00:31:14,961 --> 00:31:16,031
if your story checks out.

506
00:31:16,161 --> 00:31:18,277
All right, do I have
your consent to do that?

507
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:20,312
- Okay.

508
00:31:20,441 --> 00:31:21,397
- That's all right?
- Uh-huh.

509
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:22,192
- All right.

510
00:31:22,321 --> 00:31:22,992
Excellent.

511
00:31:23,121 --> 00:31:23,872
- All right.

512
00:31:33,721 --> 00:31:35,792
- [Detective Locarno] Well?

513
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:41,232
- Um, yeah, I'll get changed now.

514
00:32:26,761 --> 00:32:27,910
- There you go.

515
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:47,192
No, no!

516
00:32:47,321 --> 00:32:48,550
You can keep those.

517
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,600
Thank you, Josef.

518
00:32:58,721 --> 00:33:01,156
I just need some biographical
information now on you.

519
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:02,476
Uh, for the records.

520
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:05,312
When I ask you a question

521
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,557
I need you to answer out loud.

522
00:33:07,681 --> 00:33:09,035
- [Josef] Yeah.

523
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:10,310
- Full sentences, please.

524
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:16,836
- Yeah, uh, you can, uh,
(laughs) ask me some questions.

525
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:19,280
- Thank you, Josef.

526
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:20,630
Not so difficult, right?

527
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:25,519
Uh, state and spell your name for me.

528
00:33:26,441 --> 00:33:28,955

agency, and what we do--

550
00:34:34,081 --> 00:34:34,832
- How big?

551
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:36,632
- What?

552
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,396
- How big's your agency?

553
00:34:40,321 --> 00:34:43,074
- Well, there's the owner.

554
00:34:43,201 --> 00:34:44,396
- [Detective Locarno] Okay.

555
00:34:44,521 --> 00:34:45,955
- And then

556
00:34:47,401 --> 00:34:48,232
there's me.

557
00:34:50,561 --> 00:34:51,596
- Two people, that's it?

558
00:34:51,721 --> 00:34:52,472
- [Josef] Yeah.

559
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:55,440
- How much talent do you manage?

560
00:34:58,681 --> 00:34:59,796
Clients, Joe.

561
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:00,592
How many clients you got?

562
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:02,951
- Uh, (laughs) we're in
discussion with a number

563
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:04,151
of potential clients at this--

564
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:04,998
- How many?

565
00:35:06,761 --> 00:35:07,512
- Uh,

566
00:35:08,881 --> 00:35:09,757
at present,

567
00:35:09,881 --> 00:35:11,519
we currently have

568
00:35:12,521 --> 00:35:15,479
a single, primary client.

569
00:35:17,801 --> 00:35:18,677
- One client.

570
00:35:24,601 --> 00:35:25,921
So let me get this straight.

571
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:28,990
You

572
00:35:29,121 --> 00:35:30,634
and one guy--
- Woman.

573
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:31,671
A woman.

574
00:35:31,801 --> 00:35:35,590
- You work with one
woman, who has one client.

575
00:35:35,721 --> 00:35:36,517
That's it.

576
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:39,232
What do you do?

577
00:35:41,921 --> 00:35:43,480
- T identify possible projects

578
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:45,194
and implement outreach strategies.

579
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:48,637
- How much money you make?

580
00:35:48,761 --> 00:35:50,354
- Why does that matter?

581
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:51,391
- You really want to be telling me

582
00:35:51,521 --> 00:35:52,875
what matters right now, Joe?

583
00:35:57,201 --> 00:35:59,078
All right, we'll let that one go.

584
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,521
Uh, how old are you?

585
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:03,392
-21

586
00:36:04,601 --> 00:36:08,037
(Detective Matthews laughs)

587
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:08,957
25.

588
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:09,832
- Hm.

589
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:13,880
- (laughs) All right, 26!

590
00:36:14,001 --> 00:36:16,197
(laughs) Okay, okay.

591
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:18,392
- Isn't your late 20s still, like

592
00:36:18,521 --> 00:36:21,559
a little old to be trying
to make it in film?

593
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:25,151
- I think 26 is still your mid-twenties?

594
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:29,672
- Is that true?

595
00:36:55,441 --> 00:36:57,432
- How well did you know Jesse Burstner?

596
00:36:59,921 --> 00:37:00,672
- Who?

597
00:37:02,121 --> 00:37:03,191
- The deceased.

598
00:37:06,681 --> 00:37:07,432
So,

599
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:09,472
not well.

600
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:12,470
- Uh,

601
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:14,194
he didn't, didn't, um--

602
00:37:14,321 --> 00:37:15,675
- How did you know Jesse?

603
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:16,552
- I,

604
00:37:18,681 --> 00:37:19,352
I--

605
00:37:19,481 --> 00:37:20,710
- That's John to you.

606
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:23,793
- I'mean, I knew him obviously, you know?

607
00:37:23,921 --> 00:37:27,039
But I didn't really know him.

608
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,880
We were just starting to get
to know each other, you know.

609
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:33,637
- What was the nature
of your relationship?

610
00:37:35,841 --> 00:37:37,957
- Uh, too soon to say.

611
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:41,756
- Was it sexual?

612
00:37:41,881 --> 00:37:43,440
- Was what sexual?

613
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:47,236
- Was the relationship with
John, Jesse, was it sexual?

614
00:37:47,361 --> 00:37:49,352
- I think so? (laughs)

615
00:37:49,481 --> 00:37:51,552
- You don't know if you
had a sexual relationship?

616
00:37:51,681 --> 00:37:53,877
- (laughs) Of course I do.

617
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:55,230
I think.

618
00:37:58,441 --> 00:38:02,036
Yes we did have a sexual relationship.

619
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:02,832
(laughs) I mean--

620
00:38:02,961 --> 00:38:03,632
- Are you a,

621
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:05,240
are you a top?

622
00:38:10,241 --> 00:38:11,276
Are you a top?

623
00:38:13,321 --> 00:38:13,992
- Idon't, I mean--

624
00:38:14,121 --> 00:38:16,317
- It's a simple question, really.

625
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:20,878
Do you fuck or do you get fucked?

626
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:22,400
- Oh, I don't accept the dichotomy

627
00:38:22,521 --> 00:38:25,274
implied by your question. (laughs)

628
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:27,752
- Josef.

629
00:38:31,721 --> 00:38:32,472
- Yeah.

630
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:36,712
- I'need an answer to my question, Josef.

631
00:38:37,681 --> 00:38:39,319
- Are you allowed to ask that?

632
00:38:39,441 --> 00:38:40,158
- Sure, why not?

633
00:38:41,401 --> 00:38:42,357
- Privacy?

634
00:38:42,481 --> 00:38:43,232
- Joe.

635
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:47,239
Privacy is for people
in houses and offices.

636
00:38:47,361 --> 00:38:48,954
Privacy isn't for people like you.

637
00:38:50,921 --> 00:38:52,320
So I'll just, I'll ask you again.

638
00:38:52,441 --> 00:38:54,751
Um, you know.

639
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:58,317
Uh, do you fuck or do you get fucked?

640
00:38:58,441 --> 00:38:59,192
- I guess

641
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,191
I'm more of a bottom.

642
00:39:04,281 --> 00:39:06,795
- So your preferred sexual activity

643
00:39:06,921 --> 00:39:09,435
is just bend over and let
another man fuck you in the ass.

644
00:39:09,561 --> 00:39:12,917
- Uh, (laughs) I don't
think I'd put it that way.

645
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:15,671
- How would you put it?

646
00:39:16,761 --> 00:39:17,512
- What?

647
00:39:18,681 --> 00:39:21,480
- How would you describe your
preferred sexual activity?

648
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:25,593
- Oh, um, I guess

649
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:27,075
I would say that,

650
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:29,272
hm,

651
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:30,550
I like to

652
00:39:33,441 --> 00:39:36,513
dick-tate the terms?

653
00:39:40,321 --> 00:39:42,756
(Josef laughs)

654
00:39:44,961 --> 00:39:46,156
Right?!

655
00:39:46,281 --> 00:39:47,316
(Josef laughs)

656
00:39:47,441 --> 00:39:50,115
(Detective Matthews laughs fakely)

657
00:39:50,241 --> 00:39:51,231
That's great!

658
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:52,032
That's great!

659
00:39:52,161 --> 00:39:54,801
Can I have some water? (laughs)

660
00:39:57,321 --> 00:39:58,959
Oh! (laughs)

661
00:39:59,081 --> 00:39:59,752
Oh, dick-tate.

662
00:39:59,881 --> 00:40:03,033
<i>'Can 1, can 1 please have some water? '?</i>

663
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:04,560
Oh man.

664
00:40:04,681 --> 00:40:05,876
- Uh, come with me.

665
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:06,957
- Oh.

666
00:40:07,081 --> 00:40:08,116
- Her, not you.

667
00:40:40,721 --> 00:40:41,472
Get in.

668
00:40:42,921 --> 00:40:44,639
You asked for water?!

669
00:40:44,761 --> 00:40:47,435
(water splashing)

670
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:50,396
Three times!

671
00:40:50,521 --> 00:40:53,195
(water splashing)

672
00:41:19,401 --> 00:41:22,120
Uh, so Josef.

673
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:25,359
What time did you get to
Jesse's apartment tonight?

674
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:29,152
Why don't you sit down?

675
00:41:29,281 --> 00:41:31,272
You're gonna get tired
just standing there.

676
00:41:34,441 --> 00:41:35,237
- T'want a lawyer.

677
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:42,079
- Josef, think about what
you're asking for, all right?

678
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:43,919
Up to now, it's been two guys,

679
00:41:44,041 --> 00:41:45,475
just you and me talking, all right?

680
00:41:45,601 --> 00:41:46,750
As soon as you ask for a lawyer

681
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:48,519
it becomes something totally different.

682
00:41:48,641 --> 00:41:49,915
Something serious.

683
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:56,200
- I

684
00:41:56,321 --> 00:41:57,197
Want a lawyer.

685
00:42:04,281 --> 00:42:05,157
- It's your choice.

686
00:42:19,761 --> 00:42:21,081
- And uh,

687
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:23,795
weren't you supposed to read
me my rights or something?

688
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:26,635
- We did, you don't remember?

689
00:42:57,601 --> 00:42:59,672
(knocking)

690
00:43:11,321 --> 00:43:12,072
- Hello?

691
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:15,917
- [Amanda] Hello?

692
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,357
This is Amanda Hastler.

693
00:43:19,481 --> 00:43:21,313
Do I have your permission to enter?

694
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:25,033
- Um, I, I, I guess so?

695
00:43:27,081 --> 00:43:29,231
- [Amanda] This is Amanda Hastler.

696
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:31,072
Do I have your permission to enter?

697
00:43:31,201 --> 00:43:33,112
- Yes, you have my permission!

698
00:43:35,921 --> 00:43:36,797
- Mr. King?

699
00:43:36,921 --> 00:43:39,276
(eerie music)

700
00:43:45,641 --> 00:43:46,836
Hello, Mr. King.

701
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:51,679
I'm Amanda Hastler.

702
00:43:51,801 --> 00:43:53,075
I'm a public defender.

703
00:43:53,201 --> 00:43:54,191
I'm your lawyer.

704
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:56,472
- Ow.

705
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:57,272
Okay then.

706
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,915
(strange music)

707
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:03,392
Won't you have a seat?

708
00:44:03,521 --> 00:44:06,195
(perplexed music)

709
00:44:16,841 --> 00:44:21,039
The county has briefed me on
the particulars of your case.

710
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:24,232
It's all gonna be okay.

711
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:26,955
<i>- They tortured someone just
because 1 asked for water.</i>

712
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:30,634
- That must have been very hard.

713
00:44:32,441 --> 00:44:33,397
- They can't do that.

714
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:37,392
Well?

715
00:44:38,721 --> 00:44:40,041
- What?

716
00:44:40,161 --> 00:44:42,994
- Aren't you gonna tell
somebody, or do something?

717
00:44:43,121 --> 00:44:44,953
- T'want you to focus on you, Josef.

718
00:44:45,961 --> 00:44:48,475
(shadowy music)

719
00:44:54,681 --> 00:44:57,150
<i>This is the defense 1
have prepared for you.</i>

720
00:44:57,281 --> 00:45:00,114
(questioning music)

721
00:45:02,761 --> 00:45:06,675
- Um, don't you want me to
tell you what happened first?

722
00:45:07,721 --> 00:45:09,678
- No, absolutely not.

723
00:45:11,681 --> 00:45:13,831
Please, just read it, Mr. King.

724
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,440
You'll find it's very good.

725
00:45:15,561 --> 00:45:18,075
(bizarre music)

726
00:45:35,761 --> 00:45:36,796
What's the matter with you?

727
00:45:36,921 --> 00:45:37,911
- Oh, uh, sorry.

728
00:45:40,161 --> 00:45:40,878
(Josef coughs)

729
00:45:41,001 --> 00:45:43,754
(mysterious music)

730
00:45:51,921 --> 00:45:53,017
- The county seems to think

731
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:55,396
they have a strong case against you.

732
00:45:57,001 --> 00:45:58,150
- Oh, um,

733
00:46:00,361 --> 00:46:02,875
they're only confident
because they're so stupid.

734
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:05,390
(creepy music)

735
00:46:10,481 --> 00:46:11,835
- I'm gonna arrange for you

736
00:46:11,961 --> 00:46:13,918
to speak with the prosecutor tonight.

737
00:46:16,081 --> 00:46:19,278
We need to convince them
that you're a good person.

738
00:46:20,441 --> 00:46:21,112
- Mm-hm.

739
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:23,755
(shadowy music)

740
00:46:27,881 --> 00:46:30,017
- Have you made your phone call?

741
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:32,271
- Uh, I don't think so.

742
00:46:32,401 --> 00:46:33,152
- Oh, do I not.

743
00:46:36,401 --> 00:46:37,721
You should call someone.

744
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:39,912
- [Josef] Who?

745
00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:40,712
- I don't know.

746
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:43,071
Your family, your employer.

747
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:45,511
Isn't anyone gonna miss you tomorrow?

748
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:50,272
- Not really.

749
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:54,235
(perplexed music)

750
00:46:58,361 --> 00:47:00,637
- I'm gonna have them bring a phone.

751
00:47:01,521 --> 00:47:04,035
{ominous music)

752
00:47:09,721 --> 00:47:11,837
(knocking)

753
00:47:47,641 --> 00:47:49,678
(beeping)

754
00:47:53,841 --> 00:47:56,515
(phone ringing)

755
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:58,200
- [Dispatcher] 911, what's your emergency?

756
00:48:00,481 --> 00:48:01,232
Hello?

757
00:48:02,281 --> 00:48:03,032
Hello?

758
00:48:06,961 --> 00:48:08,235
- I think they're sleeping.

759
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:20,677
(knocking)

760
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:42,757
- Hey.

761
00:48:45,641 --> 00:48:46,392
- Hello?

762
00:48:53,481 --> 00:48:55,836
(phone beeps)

763
00:49:11,401 --> 00:49:13,915
(phone ringing)

764
00:49:22,921 --> 00:49:26,232
- [Dispatcher] 911, what's your emergency?

765
00:49:29,881 --> 00:49:30,632
Hello?

766
00:49:32,961 --> 00:49:35,794
(dial tone droning)

767
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:39,596
(phone beeps)

768
00:49:43,601 --> 00:49:45,558
(Detective Matthews laughs)

769
00:49:45,681 --> 00:49:49,356
- Joe, Joey, Josef.

770
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:53,475
Are you surprised?

771
00:49:55,281 --> 00:49:56,316
- Not really.

772
00:49:56,441 --> 00:49:57,954
- Not even a little?

773
00:50:02,601 --> 00:50:05,593
- Aren't there people watching?

774
00:50:05,721 --> 00:50:07,155
- Silly Joey.

775
00:50:09,281 --> 00:50:11,192
We don't have the budget for that.

776
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:35,394
You people turn me on so much.

777
00:50:38,641 --> 00:50:39,358
- Gays?

778
00:50:39,481 --> 00:50:42,633
(Detective Matthews laughs)

779
00:50:42,761 --> 00:50:45,719
(head thudding)

780
00:50:45,841 --> 00:50:46,592
- No.

781
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:51,116
- Blacks?

782
00:50:51,241 --> 00:50:52,231
- Guess again.

783
00:50:52,361 --> 00:50:53,112
- Men?

784
00:50:55,601 --> 00:50:57,000
- Suspects.

785
00:50:59,281 --> 00:51:00,271
Watching you

786
00:51:02,681 --> 00:51:04,592
all scared and

787
00:51:06,241 --> 00:51:08,517
guilty and helpless

788
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:12,272
quivering under the
harsh light of the law.

789
00:51:22,641 --> 00:51:23,517
It gets me

790
00:51:24,641 --> 00:51:26,120
ah

791
00:51:26,241 --> 00:51:27,515
Every

792
00:51:27,641 --> 00:51:28,472
single

793
00:51:29,321 --> 00:51:30,152
time.

794
00:51:33,641 --> 00:51:37,475
(Detective Matthews groans)

795
00:51:37,601 --> 00:51:41,310
(Detective Matthews screeches)

796
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:46,796
(Josef coughs)

797
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:56,550
Josef.

798
00:51:56,681 --> 00:51:58,592
I could tell them anything

799
00:51:58,721 --> 00:52:00,473
and they would believe me over you.

800
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:14,314
I could say

801
00:52:15,641 --> 00:52:17,120
you tried to escape,

802
00:52:19,441 --> 00:52:20,670
that you assaulted me.

803
00:52:23,401 --> 00:52:25,677
You wouldn't want that.

804
00:52:25,801 --> 00:52:26,472
Would you?

805
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:29,195
(dramatic music)

806
00:52:37,801 --> 00:52:39,235
No!

807
00:52:39,361 --> 00:52:41,477
No, you don't know what's out there!

808
00:52:41,601 --> 00:52:44,036
(urgent music)

809
00:52:51,081 --> 00:52:51,832
Ma'am.

810
00:52:53,481 --> 00:52:54,676
- Who are you talking to?

811
00:52:57,881 --> 00:52:58,632
- Her.

812
00:52:59,921 --> 00:53:02,276
(scary music)

813
00:53:05,241 --> 00:53:05,912
Bow.

814
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:08,794
(foreboding music)

815
00:53:10,601 --> 00:53:11,750
- Listen, we...

816
00:53:13,281 --> 00:53:14,157
Good evening, ma'am.

817
00:53:14,281 --> 00:53:16,750
(strange music)

818
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:23,361
We need his lawyer present.

819
00:53:23,481 --> 00:53:25,916
(spooky music)

820
00:53:53,761 --> 00:53:54,512
Counselor.

821
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:56,712
- Detective.

822
00:53:56,841 --> 00:53:59,355
(bizarre music)

823
00:55:08,681 --> 00:55:09,352
Your move.

824
00:55:09,481 --> 00:55:12,314
(suspenseful music)

825
00:55:36,721 --> 00:55:40,112
(Detective Locarno snorts)

826
00:55:50,921 --> 00:55:53,515
You don't have to answer
that if you don't want to.

827
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:56,394
(mysterious music)

828
00:56:21,361 --> 00:56:22,112
Sh!

829
00:56:23,161 --> 00:56:23,832
Careful.

830
00:56:23,961 --> 00:56:26,475
(strange music)

831
00:56:31,201 --> 00:56:33,954
(terrifying music)

832
00:56:42,321 --> 00:56:44,597
(head thuds)

833
00:56:47,801 --> 00:56:50,395
(birds chirping)

834
00:57:36,321 --> 00:57:38,597
(door bangs)

835
00:58:00,681 --> 00:58:03,639
- (laughs) I don't think you're
supposed to smoke in here.

836
00:58:05,241 --> 00:58:06,834
- What are they gonna do, arrest me?

837
00:58:07,801 --> 00:58:10,315
(flame crackling)

838
00:58:10,441 --> 00:58:11,237
- What did you do?

839
00:58:13,721 --> 00:58:14,472
- Nothing.

840
00:58:17,481 --> 00:58:18,596
- Then why are you here?

841
00:58:21,241 --> 00:58:22,390
- That's a good question.

842
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:25,360
They think that I killed someone.

843
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:29,632
- Did you?

844
00:58:31,721 --> 00:58:33,837
- Potato, potahto.

845
00:58:34,881 --> 00:58:38,351
(Joshua and Josef laughing)

846
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:41,397
- Can I have one?

847
00:58:59,121 --> 00:58:59,872
- Inhale.

848
00:59:02,601 --> 00:59:03,750
Look, just take this one.

849
00:59:08,721 --> 00:59:11,395
(flame crackling)

850
00:59:12,801 --> 00:59:14,280
Enough, enough!

851
00:59:19,401 --> 00:59:21,517
- That's it? (laughs)

852
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:22,392
- Did you inhale?

853
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:25,754
Did you breathe the smoke into your lungs

854
00:59:25,881 --> 00:59:27,633
or did you just hold it in your mouth?

855
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:31,161
(flame crackling)

856
00:59:33,281 --> 00:59:34,077
Now exhale.

857
00:59:35,761 --> 00:59:38,401
(Josef coughs)

858
00:59:38,521 --> 00:59:41,240
(Josef laughs)

859
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:42,715
- Never got it before.

860
00:59:43,841 --> 00:59:46,196
(door clicks)

861
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:19,440
- Hello, Josef.

862
01:00:19,561 --> 01:00:21,154
How are you feeling?

863
01:00:21,281 --> 01:00:22,351
- Okay, I, uh...

864
01:00:23,601 --> 01:00:25,080
- We need a new strategy.

865
01:00:27,201 --> 01:00:28,555
Liesje Burstner wants to meet you.

866
01:00:28,681 --> 01:00:30,194
1 think that's a good idea.

867
01:00:30,321 --> 01:00:31,117
- Who?

868
01:00:31,241 --> 01:00:32,800
- Jesse's sister.

869
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:36,272
- Oh.

870
01:00:36,401 --> 01:00:38,517
- Her support could mean a lot.

871
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:44,792
Josef?

872
01:00:46,961 --> 01:00:48,281
Is it all right with you?

873
01:00:50,401 --> 01:00:51,152
- Yeah.

874
01:00:53,041 --> 01:00:54,361
Okay, yeah, yeah.

875
01:01:03,881 --> 01:01:04,951
- Wait here a moment.

876
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:09,155
(knocking)

877
01:01:09,281 --> 01:01:11,795
(door clicking)

878
01:01:24,201 --> 01:01:25,111
Try this on.

879
01:02:03,881 --> 01:02:04,757
Raise your arms.

880
01:02:12,641 --> 01:02:13,392
Roll it up.

881
01:02:36,681 --> 01:02:37,432
There.

882
01:02:43,241 --> 01:02:44,879
- You see a lot of cases like mine?

883
01:02:48,801 --> 01:02:50,838
- I see cases like yours all the time.

884
01:03:01,481 --> 01:03:02,232
Take a seat.

885
01:03:14,601 --> 01:03:15,352
Get up.

886
01:03:19,721 --> 01:03:20,472
Get up.

887
01:03:21,961 --> 01:03:22,837
- Good to meet you.

888
01:03:27,201 --> 01:03:28,077
- I was wrong.

889
01:03:29,161 --> 01:03:29,832
- What?

890
01:03:29,961 --> 01:03:30,632
What do you mean?

891
01:03:30,761 --> 01:03:31,990
- Idon't want to talk to him.

892
01:03:33,081 --> 01:03:33,752
- [Detective Locarno] Are you sure?

893
01:03:33,881 --> 01:03:35,110
- I don't want to talk about Jesse.

894
01:03:35,241 --> 01:03:36,675
- He told me his name was John.

895
01:03:39,321 --> 01:03:40,675
- Of course he did.

896
01:03:40,801 --> 01:03:41,916
I want to go now.

897
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:42,872
- I'll take you to another room.

898
01:03:43,001 --> 01:03:44,355
We just have a few more questions.

899
01:03:44,481 --> 01:03:45,437
- No.

900
01:03:45,561 --> 01:03:46,232
- [Detective Locarno] Ma'am.

901
01:03:46,361 --> 01:03:47,840
- Oh I can't.

902
01:03:47,961 --> 01:03:49,235
I can't.

903
01:03:49,361 --> 01:03:51,477
I've been answering your
questions all night.

904
01:03:52,921 --> 01:03:54,275
1 was his sister.

905
01:03:57,081 --> 01:03:59,470
I want to hold on to
the person that he was.

906
01:03:59,601 --> 01:04:00,352
With me.

907
01:04:04,121 --> 01:04:05,555
T want my grief.

908
01:04:05,681 --> 01:04:06,432
My sadness.

909
01:04:08,641 --> 01:04:09,551
If I tell you about him

910
01:04:09,681 --> 01:04:11,831
he becomes the person
that you can understand.

911
01:04:12,721 --> 01:04:13,756
The facts that I can tell you,

912
01:04:13,881 --> 01:04:15,918
but he was much more than that.

913
01:04:17,801 --> 01:04:20,520
I want to hold on to
the person that he was.

914
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:23,040
T want to remember him for everything.

915
01:04:24,481 --> 01:04:25,391
Not just part of it.

916
01:04:27,761 --> 01:04:28,910
I knew more than anyone else,

917
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:31,510
and with every little bit that fades,

918
01:04:32,601 --> 01:04:33,750
and he dies again.

919
01:04:34,641 --> 01:04:35,961
And again and again.

920
01:04:37,561 --> 01:04:39,871
1 don't want to talk about him anymore.

921
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:40,991
- I'm, I'm sorry.

922
01:04:46,361 --> 01:04:48,477
(knocking)

923
01:04:52,721 --> 01:04:55,759
Um, Detective Locarno?

924
01:04:57,401 --> 01:05:00,120
Um, I wanted to make a complaint

925
01:05:00,241 --> 01:05:02,357
about inappropriate treatment.

926
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:03,960
Um, Detective Matthews really--

927
01:05:04,081 --> 01:05:05,401
- Who?

928
01:05:05,521 --> 01:05:06,670
What?

929
01:05:06,801 --> 01:05:07,996
Who are you talking about?

930
01:05:08,881 --> 01:05:10,280
- Detective Matthews.

931
01:05:10,401 --> 01:05:12,074
- Idon't know what
incident you're referring to

932
01:05:12,201 --> 01:05:14,431
but there is no Detective Matthews here.

933
01:05:14,561 --> 01:05:16,518
- She looks just like my lawyer and,

934
01:05:16,641 --> 01:05:17,790
but um,

935
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:18,752
she

936
01:05:20,481 --> 01:05:21,630
didn't have any pants on.

937
01:05:25,041 --> 01:05:27,794
Um, those questions were

938
01:05:29,161 --> 01:05:29,957
inappropriate.

939
01:05:31,921 --> 01:05:34,310
Those question you asked me about my job

940
01:05:34,441 --> 01:05:36,239
and being gay

941
01:05:36,361 --> 01:05:38,034
and sex and

942
01:05:39,841 --> 01:05:40,592
what I like.

943
01:05:41,801 --> 01:05:43,200
It was,

944
01:05:43,321 --> 01:05:44,197
it was homophobic.

945
01:05:46,441 --> 01:05:48,876
- Kid, I've been a cop
in the city for 23 years.

946
01:05:49,801 --> 01:05:50,632
I don't know what you were doing tonight

947
01:05:50,761 --> 01:05:52,593
but I was doing my job.

948
01:05:52,721 --> 01:05:54,837
If you think otherwise, call your lawyer.

949
01:05:54,961 --> 01:05:56,440
1 like her, she's very good.

950
01:06:02,081 --> 01:06:03,515
Listen, it's been a long night.

951
01:06:04,441 --> 01:06:05,795
Let's just forget about this.

952
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:28,272
- Well.

953
01:06:29,201 --> 01:06:31,317
That didn't go as well
as I would have liked.

954
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:40,997
Now what happens is

955
01:06:41,121 --> 01:06:44,432
the county decides whether
or not to release you

956
01:06:44,561 --> 01:06:45,312
or charge you.

957
01:06:47,121 --> 01:06:48,998
Depending on the decision

958
01:06:49,121 --> 01:06:50,759
after that your options can be--

959
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:53,270
- Ms. Hayser.

960
01:06:53,401 --> 01:06:54,072
- Hastler.

961
01:06:54,201 --> 01:06:54,872
- Oh, sorry.

962
01:06:55,001 --> 01:06:56,150
Um,

963
01:06:56,281 --> 01:06:57,191
Ms. Hastler.

964
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,354
1 think I should tell you something.

965
01:07:04,641 --> 01:07:05,961
- Go ahead.

966
01:07:06,081 --> 01:07:08,436
- Um, my parents,

967
01:07:08,561 --> 01:07:09,312
my family

968
01:07:10,601 --> 01:07:12,000
are kind of

969
01:07:12,121 --> 01:07:13,441
kind of important.

970
01:07:13,561 --> 01:07:15,040
In the city.

971
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:16,390
In politics.

972
01:07:16,521 --> 01:07:18,353
We're kind of a

973
01:07:18,481 --> 01:07:19,960
important family

974
01:07:20,081 --> 01:07:20,832
here.

975
01:07:21,961 --> 01:07:25,079
And you know my last name is King, right?

976
01:07:25,201 --> 01:07:25,997
- Mm-hm.

977
01:07:26,881 --> 01:07:28,997
- My parents are Kings.

978
01:07:29,121 --> 01:07:31,078
They are the Kings.

979
01:07:37,361 --> 01:07:38,157
I'm adopted.

980
01:07:43,721 --> 01:07:44,677
- You're a King.

981
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:46,912
- Yeah.

982
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:50,591
- You're the adopted son
of David and Jessica King?

983
01:07:50,721 --> 01:07:51,472
- Yeah.

984
01:07:53,561 --> 01:07:54,357
- Are you shitting me?

985
01:07:54,481 --> 01:07:55,152
- No, no!

986
01:07:55,281 --> 01:07:56,476
No, they really are my parents.

987
01:07:56,601 --> 01:07:58,558
You can look it up and see everything.

988
01:07:58,681 --> 01:08:01,150
I mean there's, there's
pictures and stuff, you know.

989
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:05,840
- And you thought this
might be helpful to mention?

990
01:08:05,961 --> 01:08:07,235
Why didn't you say something earlier?

991
01:08:07,361 --> 01:08:08,795
- Idon't like using it.

992
01:08:08,921 --> 01:08:10,753
They're just my parents.

993
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,030
- I have to go tell them.

994
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:19,600
There's no way the county will
bring charges against a King.

995
01:08:19,721 --> 01:08:21,120
Not now.

996
01:08:21,241 --> 01:08:23,152
Give me a few minutes,
I'll see what I can do.

997
01:08:33,601 --> 01:08:35,797
Would you mention my name to your father?

998
01:08:35,921 --> 01:08:38,231
If you feel like it's
appropriate, of course.

999
01:08:39,601 --> 01:08:41,592
- Uh, yeah.

1000
01:08:41,721 --> 01:08:42,677
Yeah, of course.

1001
01:08:44,841 --> 01:08:45,592
- Great.

1002
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:48,637
(knocking)

1003
01:09:57,441 --> 01:09:59,478
(banging)

1004
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:03,272
- You're free to go, Mr. King.

1005
01:10:07,521 --> 01:10:08,556
- Where's, um,

1006
01:10:10,761 --> 01:10:11,717
Ms. Hastler?

1007
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:14,310
I wanted to thank her.

1008
01:10:17,761 --> 01:10:18,831
- She's busy.

1009
01:10:20,881 --> 01:10:21,677
I'll let her know.

1010
01:10:24,121 --> 01:10:24,872
- Okay.

1011
01:11:19,601 --> 01:11:20,352
Hello?

1012
01:14:15,681 --> 01:14:18,400
(perplexing music)
