00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:22,093
Okay, hold on.

3
00:03:26,462 --> 00:03:27,995
Are you really
selling everything?

4
00:03:27,997 --> 00:03:29,533
Yeah. Need the money.

5
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:36,341
These are nice.

6
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,905
Thanks.

7
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:39,840
Do I want to know
where you got them?

8
00:03:39,842 --> 00:03:40,877
Does it matter?

9
00:03:42,044 --> 00:03:42,946
No.

10
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:46,651
How much do you want?

11
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:48,719
Thirty.

12
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,919
Fifteen.

13
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:52,856
Twenty.

14
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:55,792
I'll do twenty.

15
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,173
- Not that.
- Excuse me.

16
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:12,777
- Excuse yourself.
- Wait outside.

17
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:18,081
This is extortion.

18
00:04:28,658 --> 00:04:30,161
Your mom had good taste.

19
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:32,864
Keep it.

20
00:04:34,197 --> 00:04:37,632
Hey, if I ever see you in my house
again, I'll break your arms.

21
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:39,634
Yeah, I'll still have both
my legs to kick you in the...

22
00:04:39,636 --> 00:04:40,671
Hey, asshole!

23
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,042
And tell your sister
to brush her teeth.

24
00:04:55,985 --> 00:04:58,688
I could take in that guy, I
just needed like thirty seconds.

25
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:01,957
Now he'll just keep coming back.

26
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,757
What did you
even do to him?

27
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,026
Nothing. Nothing.

28
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:06,129
Yeah. Bullshit.

29
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:48,072
Hit it, Robert.

30
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:55,480
Hey, grandma.

31
00:06:14,064 --> 00:06:15,500
What'll t be today?

32
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,036
Another shitty
soap opera this is?

33
00:06:20,237 --> 00:06:22,937
Or UFC?

34
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:25,072
Where's the rest
of her pills for this week?

35
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:26,808
I don't know.

36
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,846
- Oh, we ran out.
- When?

37
00:06:30,112 --> 00:06:31,680
Sunday?

38
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,985
That was five days ago.
Why are you telling me now?

39
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:37,017
Does it matter?
It's not like they work.

40
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:38,252
Oscar.

41
00:06:38,254 --> 00:06:40,788
I'll go to pharmacy tomorrow.

42
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,093
No, it's fine. I got it.
I've signed this.

43
00:06:44,124 --> 00:06:44,794
And stop being a shit at school.

44
00:06:46,163 --> 00:06:52,233
"Oscar's been involved in three
physical altercations this week".

45
00:06:52,235 --> 00:06:53,668
Say "ah".

46
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,072
"He's been displaying behaviors that
are against our bullying policy.

47
00:06:57,074 --> 00:06:59,242
Please contact the school
immediately to schedule a meeting".

48
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,678
Nope.

49
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:07,084
Sean!

50
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:08,752
Seany!

51
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:19,961
Man, get your scrawny ass down
here, come take me to this party.

52
00:07:19,963 --> 00:07:21,930
- Give me a minute.
- All right. I'm coming up.

53
00:07:21,932 --> 00:07:24,264
No, no, stay there. I'm coming.

54
00:07:24,266 --> 00:07:26,002
I'm cooking down here, bro.

55
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:28,939
Uh...

56
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,339
I'm heading out.

57
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:33,375
There's some cash
on the kitchen counter.

58
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:35,646
Just order a pizza
and look after grandma.

59
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,085
Just you and me.

60
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:46,221
Hey, man, why you never
invite me upstairs?

61
00:07:46,223 --> 00:07:47,223
It's messy.

62
00:07:49,392 --> 00:07:51,828
- Where did you get the gas?
- Hey, don't worry about it.

63
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:56,798
Yo, the night
is going to be epic.

64
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,067
Yeah? We don't even
like these people.

65
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:00,668
They don't even like me.

66
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,372
True.

67
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:07,442
Bro, how about you just try to be
like a teenager for one night?

68
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:10,211
Then you go back to being
a single mom in the morning.

69
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:11,649
All right, now unlock the door.

70
00:08:15,084 --> 00:08:16,885
Okay, bro, my bad about the mom.

71
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:17,922
It's fine.

72
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:24,392
No, no, you got to push.

73
00:08:24,394 --> 00:08:25,392
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

74
00:08:25,394 --> 00:08:27,130
The starter's shit,
you got to push the car.

75
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:40,474
Whoa, whoa!

76
00:08:40,476 --> 00:08:41,312
Hold up!

77
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:44,914
Starter, my ass.

78
00:08:52,254 --> 00:08:53,691
What's going on?

79
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:00,398
That's a fun night.

80
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,234
Damn.

81
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:09,873
Come on bro, we're here,
baby. We're here.

82
00:09:11,475 --> 00:09:13,407
Look at the drink stand.

83
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:14,844
What's going on, bro?

84
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:17,114
Hey! What's happening?

85
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:21,849
Snap.

86
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:24,752
You know they got drinks...
drinks over there?

87
00:09:24,754 --> 00:09:26,090
Yo, give me five, all right?

88
00:09:38,902 --> 00:09:40,037
Nathan!

89
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:47,502
Yep.

90
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:48,404
She looks good.

91
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:52,040
I think she's
with that Tom guy now.

92
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:53,273
- For real?
- Mm-Mm.

93
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:54,943
Nah, I don't think
that's official.

94
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,411
I mean, Chris Harris says he's been making
out with her every day after homecoming.

95
00:10:57,413 --> 00:10:58,515
Really?

96
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,318
But you know we talk shit.
You know that guy talks shit.

97
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,353
All right, my man
is a professional shit-talker.

98
00:11:05,355 --> 00:11:08,623
So, you... right? That
can't... that's not true.

99
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,291
She's... yeah, she's going
to... she's coming right over.

100
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:13,427
How is it going?
Can't handle the cool kids?

101
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:15,298
- I'm here for a refill.
- Refill.

102
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:23,039
Huh? You need me. I'm coming right
now, bro. I'm coming right now.

103
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,546
What's new? How's your grandma?

104
00:11:32,548 --> 00:11:34,449
- She's good. Yeah.
- Good.

105
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:35,820
- It's so sweet.
- Yeah.

106
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:37,388
Yeah.

107
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,391
Actually she's not.

108
00:11:41,457 --> 00:11:44,191
She's like completely out of it.

109
00:11:44,193 --> 00:11:46,262
Most days she doesn't
talk much anymore.

110
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:48,966
Yeah.

111
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,001
It sucks.

112
00:11:53,937 --> 00:11:54,971
Your stepmom?

113
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:57,040
Still a bitch.

114
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:04,945
- Is that real?
- Yeah.

115
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:08,215
Got it a couple
months ago. It's...

116
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:11,087
It means I'm the way
and the truth and the light.

117
00:12:12,254 --> 00:12:13,423
Tom got one too.

118
00:12:15,357 --> 00:12:18,258
That was like a two
for one thing.

119
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,459
That's cute.

120
00:12:19,461 --> 00:12:21,164
Yeah. We thought so.

121
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,535
So, you guys
are like serious now?

122
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,141
I don't know about serious,
but we have fun.

123
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:34,044
You mean you have sex.

124
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,381
Jesus.

125
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:40,381
- Sean, really?
- So, yeah, I'm right.

126
00:12:40,383 --> 00:12:41,418
Yeah, you're right.

127
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:45,420
Look, I don't know even know
why you would care.

128
00:12:45,422 --> 00:12:47,021
You haven't spoken more
than two words to me

129
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:48,555
since we got off high school.

130
00:12:48,557 --> 00:12:50,691
I get that you were
going through a lot.

131
00:12:50,693 --> 00:12:53,361
Don't do that.
I don't want your pity.

132
00:12:53,363 --> 00:12:54,364
That's not what that is.

133
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:59,168
I would have been there
in a second if you asked.

134
00:13:00,403 --> 00:13:01,471
But you weren't.

135
00:13:06,543 --> 00:13:08,443
Have a great night.
I hope that you're good.

136
00:13:08,445 --> 00:13:11,079
Yeah. I'm awesome.

137
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,115
Bet you are.

138
00:13:16,653 --> 00:13:17,454
Alex.

139
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,455
What?

140
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:22,158
Can't we just talk?

141
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,461
Like not here?

142
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:28,065
Will you call me?

143
00:13:29,032 --> 00:13:31,134
I got a new phone.
I don't have your number.

144
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:34,170
Sorry.

145
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:42,312
Jesus, Sean.

146
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,949
Now you have it.

147
00:13:50,653 --> 00:13:52,020
- Hey.
- Hey.

148
00:13:52,022 --> 00:13:53,490
Road's waiting. You coming?

149
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:03,031
Have fun.

150
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:04,401
We will. Sweet to have you.

151
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:25,990
Do you feel it?

152
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,623
I feel butterflies.

153
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:31,562
It's okay. Just a moment.

154
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:43,567
Hey, yo!

155
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:47,767
Yo, yo, yo, yo. Yo, I need you to come and
introduce yourself again to this girl

156
00:15:47,769 --> 00:15:49,302
so that she says her name again.

157
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:50,872
It's like the "Yeladarah",
but I can't...

158
00:15:50,874 --> 00:15:52,242
I think I'm done.

159
00:15:53,408 --> 00:15:55,276
- For real?
- Yeah.

160
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:57,114
Maybe it's written
in her underwear.

161
00:15:58,748 --> 00:15:59,583
Genius.

162
00:16:00,817 --> 00:16:02,550
Quite the mob.

163
00:16:02,552 --> 00:16:04,384
Go home safe, alright?

164
00:16:04,386 --> 00:16:05,721
I care about you.

165
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,794
Alex!

166
00:16:16,365 --> 00:16:17,234
Alex!

167
00:16:34,517 --> 00:16:35,419
Shit.

168
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,208
Alex!

169
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,244
Alex!

170
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:40,350
Alex.

171
00:17:45,555 --> 00:17:46,720
Shit.

172
00:17:46,722 --> 00:17:47,924
What am I doing?

173
00:19:09,638 --> 00:19:10,439
Hey.

174
00:19:14,477 --> 00:19:15,679
Just get her legs.

175
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:57,084
<i>Behind me.</i>

176
00:19:57,086 --> 00:19:58,654
<i>I got your back. Cover me!</i>

177
00:20:00,123 --> 00:20:01,424
<i>I need a distraction!</i>

178
00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:04,491
<i>Goddamn it, Callaghan,
watch your back!</i>

179
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:05,728
<i>Protect your black ass!</i>

180
00:20:10,098 --> 00:20:12,999
<i>Overnight temperature has
been dropped into the sixties</i>

181
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:14,471
<i>and tomorrow's forecast...</i>

182
00:20:50,006 --> 00:20:50,707
Hey.

183
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:11,894
Are you okay?

184
00:21:36,018 --> 00:21:37,019
What happened to you?

185
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:46,563
If you tell me where you live,
I can take you back home.

186
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,138
There.

187
00:22:01,544 --> 00:22:02,879
Are you sure you're okay?

188
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,682
You're welcome.

189
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:02,805
You need me to call the police?

190
00:23:03,873 --> 00:23:04,774
Anyone?

191
00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:08,879
Here, help yourself.

192
00:23:59,662 --> 00:24:00,230
Hello?

193
00:24:03,065 --> 00:24:03,566
Hello?

194
00:24:05,634 --> 00:24:06,967
Okay, I'm hanging up.

195
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:07,836
<i>Please...</i>

196
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:09,873
<i>don't.</i>

197
00:24:11,707 --> 00:24:13,243
Alex? You okay?

198
00:24:14,143 --> 00:24:14,944
Yeah.

199
00:24:17,712 --> 00:24:19,115
What happened? Where are you?

200
00:24:25,654 --> 00:24:27,654
Where am I?

201
00:24:27,656 --> 00:24:29,291
Casey's Diner on 65.

202
00:24:53,182 --> 00:24:54,049
Hey.

203
00:24:59,922 --> 00:25:01,287
What happened?

204
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:04,193
She showed up half naked.
So, I gave her some clothes.

205
00:25:06,862 --> 00:25:08,961
I should call the cops.

206
00:25:08,963 --> 00:25:11,067
Please don't.
I'll take her home. Alex.

207
00:25:13,201 --> 00:25:13,903
Come on.

208
00:25:16,872 --> 00:25:17,407
Let's go.

209
00:25:26,781 --> 00:25:28,417
You can crash
at my place if you want.

210
00:25:31,353 --> 00:25:35,859
Just to give you a chance to sleep
off whatever you took at the party.

211
00:25:59,414 --> 00:26:00,416
You want to change?

212
00:26:44,393 --> 00:26:45,228
Hey.

213
00:26:46,428 --> 00:26:49,232
Yeah. Your nose is bleeding.

214
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:54,304
Just hold that.

215
00:26:56,305 --> 00:26:57,941
Just... wait.

216
00:27:00,276 --> 00:27:01,341
Okay.

217
00:27:01,343 --> 00:27:02,445
Lean your head back.

218
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:04,480
Okay.

219
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:08,384
Just... just... okay, okay.

220
00:27:14,423 --> 00:27:15,325
Let me see.

221
00:27:21,997 --> 00:27:24,134
Yeah, okay. I think it stopped.

222
00:27:33,442 --> 00:27:34,911
You won't even...

223
00:28:15,483 --> 00:28:20,053
<i>President Trump has not retreated

224

<i>One way of John Street is temporarily closed

227
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:16,142

228
00:29:16,144 --> 00:29:18,378
<i>...forbidding drivers

229
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,279
Sure thing.

230
00:29:20,281 --> 00:29:23,986
<i>Police have been on scene since last week
cautioning drivers and issuing tickets.</i>

231
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:28,020
<i>Officers say drivers tell them
they don't see the sign</i>

232
00:29:28,022 --> 00:29:29,855
<i>or that they don't see
the danger.</i>

233
00:29:29,857 --> 00:29:35,030
<i>But police say the risk is real for both
motorists and construction workers.</i>

234
00:29:36,397 --> 00:29:38,198
<i>An eventful night
in the Plano Valley.</i>

235
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,969
<i>The southland blackout left three
hundred thousand homes without power.</i>

236
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:46,139
<i>The result of an electrical
surge at a large transformer.</i>

237
00:29:46,141 --> 00:29:49,241
<i>It lit up the night's sky

238
00:29:49,243 --> 00:29:52,144
<i>prompting a flood of calls

239
00:29:52,146 --> 00:29:55,684
<i>Some have suggested
a meteor or northern lights.</i>

<i>Vandals have a struck a hole at near

<i>High Street near Hillcrest Park's been

<i>Residents complained that fast-moving

244
00:30:13,402 --> 00:30:14,604
Is that you, Janey?

245
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,474
You're not Janey.

246

251
00:30:57,078 --> 00:30:58,347
Oh, fuck.

252
00:31:12,528 --> 00:31:13,596
Good morning, sweetheart.

253
00:31:17,332 --> 00:31:18,267
Where's your brother?

254
00:31:20,134 --> 00:31:22,305
Chocolate for breakfast, really?

255
00:31:25,441 --> 00:31:28,177
I'm going to the store.
Get that mess cleaned up.

256
00:31:47,229 --> 00:31:48,163
Sean?

257
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,836
Shit!

258
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:06,373
Hey, Sean, you got to see this.

259
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:08,440
Look, this... this girl, you got
to see what she can do.

260
00:33:08,442 --> 00:33:09,742
She has some crazy
powers or something.

261
00:33:09,744 --> 00:33:12,211
- What, Alex?
- Alex?

262
00:33:12,213 --> 00:33:14,413
We need to get you home. They think
you're like missing or something.

263
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:16,850
No, no, no, listen,
you have to see this.

264
00:33:16,852 --> 00:33:17,718
Where's grandma?

265
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,253
- She's gone. She went out.
- What?

266
00:33:20,255 --> 00:33:21,854
She's fine. She went out.

267
00:33:21,856 --> 00:33:23,957
- Grandma!
- No, she's fine. She's totally fine.

268
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:26,625
- What do you mean?
- I mean, she's completely okay. She's back to normal.

269
00:33:26,627 --> 00:33:27,561
What...

270
00:33:27,563 --> 00:33:28,598
Good morning.

271
00:33:38,472 --> 00:33:41,610
What's the matter with you two? Come
on, help me put this stuff away.

272
00:33:43,244 --> 00:33:44,544
You're okay.

273
00:33:44,546 --> 00:33:45,715
Of course I'm okay.

274
00:33:48,817 --> 00:33:51,617
Sorry, this is Alex.

275
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:52,754
I know. We've met.

276
00:33:54,189 --> 00:33:57,257
You know, some notice would be nice
if someone's going to stay over.

277
00:33:57,259 --> 00:34:00,496
I mean, this place looks
like a circus for the night.

278
00:34:01,762 --> 00:34:03,665
No offense.

279
00:34:05,933 --> 00:34:07,667
You know, you got
Sean all love sick.

280
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:09,769
- Jesus, grandma.
- Don't you 'Jesus' me.

281
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:13,740
You don't think she could see it?
Look, your face is all flushed.

282
00:34:13,742 --> 00:34:14,644
It's lovely.

283
00:34:15,911 --> 00:34:18,813
Sean, set the table. Alex, how
would you like your eggs?

284
00:34:26,487 --> 00:34:29,291
Haven't seen my grandma like
that in, I don't know how long.

285
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:31,527
That was crazy.

286
00:34:34,528 --> 00:34:36,498
Hopefully, she still
remembers how to drive.

287
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:55,550
Okay, we should hurry.

288
00:34:56,818 --> 00:34:59,222
Can't really have the cops coming
to my house looking for you.

289
00:35:01,356 --> 00:35:02,258
Okay.

290
00:35:05,827 --> 00:35:06,929
What did he give you?

291
00:35:07,996 --> 00:35:08,961
Who?

292
00:35:08,963 --> 00:35:11,766
What do you mean, who?
Tom, your boyfriend.

293
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:15,367
Someone gave you a pill
at the party.

294
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:16,970
I can't remember anything.

295
00:35:16,972 --> 00:35:20,276
Then why didn't you ask him to pick you
up when you're out with friends. Why me?

296
00:35:31,887 --> 00:35:32,788
Right.

297
00:35:43,764 --> 00:35:44,733
Where are you going?

298
00:35:48,003 --> 00:35:49,372
Your house is that way.

299
00:35:55,409 --> 00:35:56,842
Seriously?

300
00:35:56,844 --> 00:35:58,346
You don't remember
where you live?

301
00:35:59,514 --> 00:36:00,950
Tell Tom to get better drugs.

302
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:05,117
Or you could just get
a better boyfriend.

303
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:05,987
Okay.

304
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:10,393
That was a joke.

305
00:36:31,847 --> 00:36:34,012
Alex, where the hell
have you been?

306
00:36:34,014 --> 00:36:34,884
I'm sorry.

307
00:36:36,385 --> 00:36:38,521
They found all of your stuff
by the reservoir.

308
00:36:39,454 --> 00:36:40,722
We thought you were dead.

309
00:36:42,157 --> 00:36:43,693
Why don't you step in, son?

310
00:36:48,963 --> 00:36:50,498
Mister Lainey, please.

311
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,066
It's his wife.

312
00:36:53,068 --> 00:36:55,471
Hi, yeah. She just walked
through the door.

313
00:36:56,771 --> 00:36:58,405
You're fine, right?

314
00:36:58,407 --> 00:36:59,041
Alex!

315
00:37:01,675 --> 00:37:04,079
I... I don't know.

316
00:37:31,106 --> 00:37:32,007
Alex!

317
00:37:35,043 --> 00:37:37,646
Just talk to them. You
didn't do anything wrong.

318
00:37:53,027 --> 00:37:55,228
What? What is it?

319
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,865
We shouldn't have come here.

320
00:38:00,168 --> 00:38:01,967
What's over those mountains?

321
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:04,706
I don't know. Just
hundred miles of desert.

322
00:38:14,014 --> 00:38:15,882
It's not just desert.

323
00:38:15,884 --> 00:38:17,686
- What?
- Alex!

324
00:38:27,963 --> 00:38:30,966
Alex. Honey, just open
the door, please.

325
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:41,874
Alex.

326
00:38:41,876 --> 00:38:43,175
Can you just open
the door for me?

327
00:38:43,177 --> 00:38:44,512
Alex, open the door.

328
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,012
I think I should go.

329
00:38:47,014 --> 00:38:48,680
Alex!

330
00:38:48,682 --> 00:38:50,885
Alex, open
the goddamn door right now!

331
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:54,122
Alex, open the door right now!

332
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:31,124
Alex!

333
00:39:31,126 --> 00:39:32,325
What? How did...?

334
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:34,159
Alex! Come back here!

335
00:39:34,161 --> 00:39:34,797
Alex.

336
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:39,632
Alex.

337
00:39:39,634 --> 00:39:41,568
Wait! Where are you going?

338
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,872
I don't belong here.

339
00:39:44,873 --> 00:39:46,242
Alex? Alex!

340
00:39:48,577 --> 00:39:49,011
Alex!

341
00:39:52,246 --> 00:39:53,047
Alex!

342
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,719
Slow down!

343
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:15,969
<i>Caucasian female,
five-seven, Alex Lainey, seventeen.</i>

344
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:19,771
<i>Caucasian male, five-eight, seventeen
in black and white number one,</i>

345
00:40:19,773 --> 00:40:22,076
<i>one, six, sending out
AMBER Alert.</i>

346
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:28,146
You can just go back and tell them
that I forced you to come with me.

347
00:40:28,148 --> 00:40:30,552
You did force me. You
pushed me out of window.

348
00:40:35,623 --> 00:40:37,025
How did you know
you could do that?

349
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:42,662
I didn't know. It just happened.

350
00:40:42,664 --> 00:40:44,133
That doesn't just happen.

351
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,777
You got to tell
me something, just

352
00:40:55,943 --> 00:40:58,581
anything so I don't feel
like I'm losing my mind.

353
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:08,757
I was under water.

354
00:41:11,826 --> 00:41:14,762
It's like I was drowning...
I was drowning.

355
00:41:17,264 --> 00:41:18,634
I should be dead.

356
00:41:23,204 --> 00:41:25,307
But there was something
in the water with me.

357
00:41:36,351 --> 00:41:37,820
I can still feel it.

358
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:44,626
What does it feel like?

359
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:25,901
So, you're like...

360
00:42:26,867 --> 00:42:27,735
what, like

361
00:42:29,737 --> 00:42:31,339
magnetic or something?

362
00:42:32,873 --> 00:42:33,908
I don't know.

363
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,416
Wait.

364
00:42:49,923 --> 00:42:51,090
Okay. Do it again.

365
00:42:51,092 --> 00:42:52,258
Do what again?

366
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,360
Your thing. Do it again.

367
00:42:54,362 --> 00:42:57,329
I don't know how to do it.
I don't... it just happens.

368
00:42:57,331 --> 00:42:58,866
Just do what you did.

369
00:43:13,815 --> 00:43:15,384
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

370
00:43:16,451 --> 00:43:18,219
Wait, wait, wait,
just put it back.

371
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,789
Just let me try
one more time.

372
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,222
Alex.

373
00:43:57,224 --> 00:43:58,226
Is it working?

374
00:44:00,994 --> 00:44:02,830
Damn it, I thought
that I had it.

375
00:44:36,998 --> 00:44:38,432
We need to get off the road.

376
00:44:58,052 --> 00:44:59,121
What can I get you?

377
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:05,260
Sprite, Cherry Coke and two
chicken fingers with fries.

378
00:45:20,407 --> 00:45:21,375
You okay?

379
00:45:26,481 --> 00:45:27,349
I'm fine.

380
00:45:34,422 --> 00:45:35,688
It's Cherry Coke.

381
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:37,358
I know you hate that diet stuff.

382
00:45:38,927 --> 00:45:41,063
Well, you used to.

383
00:45:50,405 --> 00:45:53,108
You seriously don't
remember anything?

384
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,212
You know when you have a dream

385
00:45:59,447 --> 00:46:01,646
and it's so intense

386
00:46:01,648 --> 00:46:03,551
you think that
it's actually happening?

387
00:46:06,086 --> 00:46:08,422
But then by the time you
brush your teeth, it's all gone.

388
00:46:11,224 --> 00:46:13,059
That's how my life feels.

389
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:15,360
I know that all this stuff
happened, I just...

390
00:46:15,362 --> 00:46:17,265
I can't remember any of it.

391
00:46:19,233 --> 00:46:21,536
Up until last night
when you picked me up.

392
00:46:30,077 --> 00:46:31,313
I'm glad you called me.

393
00:46:35,615 --> 00:46:36,652
Do you mean that?

394
00:46:39,353 --> 00:46:40,187
Yeah.

395
00:46:47,762 --> 00:46:49,664
I feel like we're
Bonnie and Clyde.

396
00:46:51,699 --> 00:46:53,501
I don't know who that is.

397
00:46:55,202 --> 00:46:57,369
Chicken tenders.

398
00:46:57,371 --> 00:46:58,338
Thank you.

399
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,606
Now listen, this ain't
none of my business

400
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,477
but those boys over there have
been watching you for a while.

401
00:47:08,449 --> 00:47:10,349
Can I get this to go?

402
00:47:10,351 --> 00:47:11,286
Sure, baby.

403
00:47:13,588 --> 00:47:15,123
- Let's go.
- What's wrong?

404
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:27,168
Hey, you're Alex Lainey, right?

405
00:47:28,635 --> 00:47:30,404
I know you guys
are like fugitives.

406
00:47:35,742 --> 00:47:37,278
Dude, what did I tell you?

407
00:47:38,713 --> 00:47:40,278
See?

408
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,646
I thought you were dead.

409
00:47:41,648 --> 00:47:43,250
Where the hell have you been?

410
00:47:45,485 --> 00:47:46,587
Did he kidnap you?

411
00:47:48,255 --> 00:47:49,023
No.

412
00:47:49,923 --> 00:47:51,322
Whatever, just get
in the truck, Alex.

413
00:47:51,324 --> 00:47:53,391
She's not going with you.

414
00:47:53,393 --> 00:47:55,126
I don't even know
who you are, man.

415
00:47:55,128 --> 00:47:57,365
I'm taking you home
to your family.

416
00:47:58,432 --> 00:47:59,465
Let's go.

417
00:47:59,467 --> 00:48:00,398
Hey.

418
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,666
- Alex.
- Sean!

419
00:48:01,668 --> 00:48:03,170
- Sean!
- Alex!

420
00:48:40,775 --> 00:48:42,508
You need to get in the car.

421
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:43,775
Sorry, who are you?

422
00:48:43,777 --> 00:48:45,510
If you want to make it through
the night, get in the car now.

423
00:48:45,512 --> 00:48:47,445
- Thanks, we're fine.
- No, you're not.

424
00:48:47,447 --> 00:48:49,481
- There are people looking for you.
- Yeah, we know that.

425
00:48:49,483 --> 00:48:51,550
I'm not talking about police.

426
00:48:51,552 --> 00:48:53,454
Hey. You don't recognize me?

427
00:48:55,655 --> 00:48:57,259
I gave you a ride last night.

428
00:49:03,498 --> 00:49:05,534
They'll find her
just like I did.

429
00:49:09,603 --> 00:49:12,804
I'm guessing you have a lot of questions
about what's happening to you.

430
00:49:12,806 --> 00:49:14,208
I can give you some answers.

431
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:16,445
But you need to trust me.

432
00:49:19,246 --> 00:49:21,880
Really nice of you.
I think we're...

433
00:49:21,882 --> 00:49:22,817
Alex.

434
00:49:25,652 --> 00:49:26,420
Alex.

435
00:49:29,322 --> 00:49:30,658
This is a bad idea.

436
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:51,378
Put this on.

437
00:49:55,483 --> 00:49:57,282
What is it?

438
00:49:57,284 --> 00:49:58,252
It's made of lead.

439
00:50:01,556 --> 00:50:02,657
Like at the dentist.

440
00:50:04,659 --> 00:50:05,460
Why?

441
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,362
Protection.

442
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,869
Protection from what?

443
00:50:17,605 --> 00:50:18,539
From her.

444
00:50:34,255 --> 00:50:36,921
I've seen this stuff on
YouTube. It's all bullshit.

445
00:50:36,923 --> 00:50:42,728
You're right. Most of it is grainy home
video of flying saucers, abduction stories.

446
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:45,530
They're just distractions
to throw in the six o'clock news

447
00:50:45,532 --> 00:50:48,670
to make sure that any real evidence
will get lost in the noise.

448
00:50:50,938 --> 00:50:52,340
But it's hard to hide now.

449
00:50:53,641 --> 00:50:54,943
Everyone has a camera.

450
00:50:56,643 --> 00:50:59,378
So, you're saying
those are like,

451
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,313
- what, alien spaceships?
- No, no, no, no.

452
00:51:02,315 --> 00:51:04,883
Not spaceships, just light.

453
00:51:04,885 --> 00:51:06,521
No mass to slow you down.

454
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,559
The people who are
looking for her are terrified

455
00:51:14,561 --> 00:51:16,730
because they have no idea
what they're dealing with.

456
00:51:17,831 --> 00:51:19,768
And how could you
possibly know that?

457
00:51:21,302 --> 00:51:22,202
Because I worked for them.

458
00:51:24,038 --> 00:51:26,273
They used to send me
to clean up the mess.

459
00:51:27,474 --> 00:51:29,608
Change hospital records.

460
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:30,711
Destroy evidence.

461
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,780
Whatever I had to.

462
00:51:35,449 --> 00:51:37,851
Are there others like me?

463
00:51:41,322 --> 00:51:41,890
Yes.

464
00:51:42,923 --> 00:51:45,826
There were seven other
close proximity centers.

465
00:51:49,996 --> 00:51:50,731
More?

466
00:51:52,032 --> 00:51:54,333
What happened to them?

467
00:51:54,335 --> 00:51:56,338
None of them survived
more than six hours...

468
00:51:58,371 --> 00:51:59,240
until you.

469
00:52:03,943 --> 00:52:06,512
- I'm going to die?
- No, you're not going to die.

470
00:52:06,514 --> 00:52:09,514
Look, she's fine. Show him
what you can do. You get...

471
00:52:09,516 --> 00:52:11,885
you can do... you just... Alex.

472
00:52:18,626 --> 00:52:19,657
Alex.

473
00:52:19,659 --> 00:52:20,494
Hey.

474
00:52:22,063 --> 00:52:26,065
Every minute you're with her, you've
been exposed to a kind of radiation.

475
00:52:26,067 --> 00:52:28,700
You need to get as far away
as can you from her.

476
00:52:28,702 --> 00:52:30,401
I'm not leaving her,
she needs my help.

477
00:52:30,403 --> 00:52:33,541
No, no, no, no. There is
nothing more you can do.

478
00:52:44,751 --> 00:52:48,387
When your hair starts falling out
and you're too weak to stand,

479
00:52:48,389 --> 00:52:49,891
you will wish
you took my advice.

480
00:52:57,565 --> 00:52:58,400
Why here?

481
00:53:00,434 --> 00:53:03,434
Why not like
Washington or Tokyo?

482
00:53:03,436 --> 00:53:04,605
Because we called it.

483
00:53:14,949 --> 00:53:18,950
In 1997, Chinese radio
telescopes picked up a signal,

484
00:53:18,952 --> 00:53:20,918
thousands of years old.

485
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,787
It was mathematical.

486
00:53:22,789 --> 00:53:26,925
Simple equations that create
infinitely complex symbols

487
00:53:26,927 --> 00:53:28,797
like characters
from a new language.

488
00:53:29,896 --> 00:53:31,333
Well, new to us.

489
00:53:39,606 --> 00:53:40,842
So, we built this.

490
00:53:45,445 --> 00:53:46,845
What does it do?

491
00:53:46,847 --> 00:53:49,748
Every night we project
the symbols into the sky,

492
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:52,019
hoping whoever sent it
first is watching.

493
00:53:53,987 --> 00:53:56,357
We called and they answered.

494
00:53:59,893 --> 00:54:00,961
She's the proof.

495
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:03,530
What?

496
00:54:07,934 --> 00:54:09,003
You were right.

497
00:54:10,003 --> 00:54:11,139
It's not just desert.

498
00:54:18,813 --> 00:54:20,479
So, what do we do?

499
00:54:20,481 --> 00:54:22,884
I know the protocols.
I can buy you some time,

500
00:54:23,851 --> 00:54:25,753
so we can figure out the
best way to go public with it.

501
00:54:28,054 --> 00:54:29,823
We will leave first
thing in the morning.

502
00:54:31,492 --> 00:54:33,061
I think we should get some rest.

503
00:54:35,528 --> 00:54:36,831
The trailer next door is empty.

504
00:54:37,731 --> 00:54:38,767
You can sleep there.

505
00:54:48,242 --> 00:54:49,474
Sean?

506
00:54:49,476 --> 00:54:50,476
<i>Oscar.</i>

507
00:54:50,478 --> 00:54:52,244
Where are you?

508
00:54:52,246 --> 00:54:54,813
What the hell's going on? There's like a whole
bunch of cops that are looking for you.

509
00:54:54,815 --> 00:54:55,682
<i>Is it her?</i>

510
00:54:56,684 --> 00:54:57,685
<i>It's her, isn't it?</i>

511
00:54:58,585 --> 00:54:59,650
<i>She showed you?</i>

512
00:54:59,652 --> 00:55:00,154
Yeah.

513
00:55:01,856 --> 00:55:04,222
See? I told you I wasn't lying.

514
00:55:04,224 --> 00:55:05,724
<i>Yeah.</i>

515
00:55:05,726 --> 00:55:06,661
<i>You were right.</i>

516
00:55:08,628 --> 00:55:09,630
<i>How's grandma?</i>

517
00:55:10,664 --> 00:55:13,201
She's great actually.
When are you coming back?

518
00:55:15,202 --> 00:55:16,068
Soon.

519
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:17,105
<i>Like, when?</i>

520
00:55:21,074 --> 00:55:21,842
Oscar.

521
00:55:24,244 --> 00:55:25,610
Oscar.

522
00:55:25,612 --> 00:55:27,147
<i>I can't hear you. Sean?</i>

523
00:55:28,581 --> 00:55:29,248
<i>Hello?</i>

524
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:30,784
I... I can't hear you.

525
00:55:31,985 --> 00:55:33,721
- Sean?
- Oscar.

526
00:55:36,789 --> 00:55:37,759
I love you.

527
00:55:38,692 --> 00:55:39,527
What?

528
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,963
<i>I said I love you.</i>

529
00:55:45,164 --> 00:55:46,634
<i>Just come home.</i>

530
00:56:05,152 --> 00:56:06,721
You sure that's a good idea?

531
00:56:08,222 --> 00:56:09,524
Do you trust him?

532
00:56:10,257 --> 00:56:11,693
- Cal?
- Yeah.

533
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,096
I mean, I don't know. It's...

534
00:56:17,565 --> 00:56:19,298
It's a lot.

535
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,902
It's kind of a crazy day.

536
00:56:25,806 --> 00:56:27,208
You're like part alien?

537
00:56:28,275 --> 00:56:30,075
It's not funny.

538
00:56:30,077 --> 00:56:30,912
No?

539
00:56:31,844 --> 00:56:32,846
That's what he says.

540
00:56:34,782 --> 00:56:35,617
Hell.

541
00:56:37,217 --> 00:56:39,851
You don't believe
anything he said?

542
00:56:39,853 --> 00:56:40,855
I don't know.

543
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:43,024
I don't know what I am.

544
00:56:48,027 --> 00:56:49,963
It's okay. I'm cool with it.

545
00:56:53,634 --> 00:56:54,702
Really?

546
00:57:08,114 --> 00:57:09,616
Where did you get this?

547
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,989
You gave it to me.

548
00:57:21,295 --> 00:57:23,097
I wish I could remember more.

549
00:57:24,864 --> 00:57:25,866
You're lucky.

550
00:57:31,771 --> 00:57:34,338
There's so much
I wish I could forget.

551
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:35,309
Like what?

552
00:57:37,277 --> 00:57:38,146
Just like

553
00:57:41,047 --> 00:57:44,051
my mom leaving, my grandma
getting sick right after,

554
00:57:46,387 --> 00:57:47,855
what happened between us.

555
00:58:02,068 --> 00:58:03,267
What?

556
00:58:03,269 --> 00:58:04,369
Nothing.

557
00:58:04,371 --> 00:58:06,039
- What is that?
- It's...

558
00:58:08,942 --> 00:58:12,012
I think it's from when you pushed me out
the window. I think your hand was there.

559
00:58:13,047 --> 00:58:14,148
Does it hurt?

560
00:58:15,114 --> 00:58:16,083
It's all right.

561
00:58:20,086 --> 00:58:21,655
I don't want to hurt you.

562
00:58:31,731 --> 00:58:33,300
I think we should get some rest.

563
01:01:52,331 --> 01:01:53,567
Move, move, move!

564
01:01:54,802 --> 01:01:56,333
- ...perimeter.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

565
01:01:56,335 --> 01:01:57,904
No sign of break-in.

566
01:02:01,641 --> 01:02:02,375
Hello, Cal.

567
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:05,911
I didn't expect
to see you again.

568
01:02:05,913 --> 01:02:07,945
You didn't even say goodbye.

569
01:02:07,947 --> 01:02:09,951
Well, I see you stole
some of our stuff.

570
01:02:12,952 --> 01:02:14,054
How did you find me?

571
01:02:15,021 --> 01:02:16,590
We assumed you'd
try tracking it yourself.

572
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:18,960
Anything?

573
01:02:21,327 --> 01:02:22,295
She stable?

574
01:02:25,398 --> 01:02:26,366
Twenty-eight hours.

575
01:02:27,467 --> 01:02:29,066
Incredible.

576
01:02:29,068 --> 01:02:31,202
She's different
from the others, Kate.

577
01:02:31,204 --> 01:02:33,304
You need to see
that for yourself.

578
01:02:33,306 --> 01:02:34,375
I plan to.

579
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:39,644
We have her. She's on the move.

580
01:02:39,646 --> 01:02:40,579
Heading southwest on...

581
01:02:40,581 --> 01:02:42,483
They're just trying
to connect with us.

582
01:02:43,483 --> 01:02:44,919
Take care of yourself, Cal.

583
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:19,653
Alex!

584
01:03:22,655 --> 01:03:23,523
Alex.

585
01:03:24,757 --> 01:03:26,691
Sean, just let me get on the
bus and get out of your life.

586
01:03:26,693 --> 01:03:28,360
I don't want you out of my life.

587
01:03:28,362 --> 01:03:30,494
Alex, I don't want
you out of my life.

588
01:03:30,496 --> 01:03:31,264
Sean.

589
01:03:32,532 --> 01:03:35,300
You're sick and I'm
making you sicker.

590
01:03:35,302 --> 01:03:37,369
- That's what Cal said.
- No, Cal was wrong, okay?

591
01:03:37,371 --> 01:03:39,003
Cal was wrong.

592
01:03:39,005 --> 01:03:42,206
My grandma hasn't said a word in two years
and then you show up and suddenly she's...

593
01:03:42,208 --> 01:03:44,575
she's speaking and she's normal.

594
01:03:44,577 --> 01:03:47,280
That's not some coincidence.
You did that.

595
01:03:49,215 --> 01:03:50,347
That's crazy.

596
01:03:50,349 --> 01:03:51,516
- Yeah.
- It's not true.

597
01:03:51,518 --> 01:03:52,619
Yeah, it's crazy.

598
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:55,253
It is.

599
01:03:55,255 --> 01:03:57,692
Or maybe it's the first thing
that makes any sense.

600
01:03:59,626 --> 01:04:01,358
Door's closing.

601
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:03,196
One minute, please.
Just give us one minute.

602
01:04:06,333 --> 01:04:08,302
You can get on that bus
but I'm coming with you.

603
01:04:14,206 --> 01:04:15,976
You're going to get
yourself killed.

604
01:04:28,255 --> 01:04:29,356
I'm not dead yet.

605
01:06:32,878 --> 01:06:33,847
Is there a problem?

606
01:06:42,489 --> 01:06:44,458
Everybody, stay
in your seat, please.

607
01:06:52,731 --> 01:06:54,231
Don't let them take me.

608
01:06:54,233 --> 01:06:55,402
Just keep your head down.

609
01:07:25,364 --> 01:07:26,866
- Get off!
- That's it, yeah.

610
01:07:29,268 --> 01:07:30,834
Don't hurt her!

611
01:07:30,836 --> 01:07:32,470
What are you doing to her?

612
01:07:32,472 --> 01:07:33,240
Alex!

613
01:07:34,306 --> 01:07:37,976
Alex! Leave her alone!

614
01:07:37,978 --> 01:07:39,476
Leave her alone!

615
01:07:39,478 --> 01:07:40,513
Alex!

616
01:07:41,648 --> 01:07:42,947
Alex!

617
01:07:42,949 --> 01:07:45,786
Let her go! Let her go!

618
01:07:49,389 --> 01:07:50,490
Alex!

619
01:09:43,869 --> 01:09:45,338
What are you doing to her?

620
01:09:46,538 --> 01:09:47,875
We're trying to help her.

621
01:09:51,411 --> 01:09:52,578
I want to see her.

622
01:09:55,515 --> 01:09:56,680
Sean.

623
01:09:56,682 --> 01:09:57,917
I want to see her!

624
01:10:00,619 --> 01:10:02,986
The radiation that's been
emitted has hurt a lot of people

625
01:10:02,988 --> 01:10:04,957
and it seems
to be contained in Alex.

626
01:10:05,992 --> 01:10:08,492
You've had secondary exposure
which has made you very sick.

627
01:10:08,494 --> 01:10:12,532
So, until we can get our hands
around this, you can't get near her.

628
01:10:13,766 --> 01:10:14,667
I'm sorry.

629
01:11:14,661 --> 01:11:18,495
You've been given a localized paralytic
agent to immobilize you from the neck down.

630
01:11:18,497 --> 01:11:20,565
It's for your own safety.

631
01:11:20,567 --> 01:11:21,801
Do you understand?

632
01:11:25,872 --> 01:11:27,408
Nice to meet you, Alex.

633
01:11:34,546 --> 01:11:37,784
We've been trying to establish contact
with this phenomena for a long time.

634
01:11:39,018 --> 01:11:42,189
We're like children
trying to say our first words.

635
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:47,561
All the money and resources we've
invested, it didn't matter.

636
01:11:48,895 --> 01:11:49,963
They chose your friend.

637
01:11:51,965 --> 01:11:53,600
We don't know
if it was even intentional,

638
01:11:55,033 --> 01:11:59,169
but we believe they're using Alex
as a way to communicate with us.

639
01:11:59,171 --> 01:11:59,939
What are they?

640
01:12:01,841 --> 01:12:04,878
That's a tough
question to answer.

641
01:12:05,944 --> 01:12:11,717
Our technology has had little success
getting information from them or it.

642
01:12:20,894 --> 01:12:24,631
We know that they're radiating in the
full EM spectrum and that they're old.

643
01:12:26,099 --> 01:12:29,002
So old that they may have been
there from the beginning.

644
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:31,638
Beginning of what?

645
01:12:32,671 --> 01:12:33,539
The Big Bang.

646
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:36,242
Creation, everything.

647
01:12:40,313 --> 01:12:43,083
We want to know where
they came from and why they're here.

648
01:12:43,983 --> 01:12:47,250
We think they've been attempting to
integrate their consciousness with ours.

649
01:12:47,252 --> 01:12:49,019
You're seeing this?

650
01:12:49,021 --> 01:12:53,958
Up until now those efforts have
proved problematic. Our biology rejected them.

651
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:55,125
Is she conscious?

652
01:12:55,127 --> 01:12:56,095
People died.

653
01:13:00,065 --> 01:13:01,268
She's seeing something.

654
01:13:28,994 --> 01:13:30,197
Would you excuse me?

655
01:13:36,668 --> 01:13:39,669
She's going into cardiac arrest.
We need to intubate. Let's go!

656
01:13:39,671 --> 01:13:43,240
<i>Warning: Radiation
levels have exceeded safety limits.</i>

657
01:13:43,242 --> 01:13:45,012
All right. Shut it down, now.

658
01:13:57,155 --> 01:14:00,894
<i>Warning: Radiation levels
have exceeded safety limits.</i>

659
01:14:33,993 --> 01:14:36,863
<i>Proceed to designated
quarantine zones.</i>

660
01:14:57,149 --> 01:14:58,050
Alex.

661
01:15:23,109 --> 01:15:24,111
Alex...

662
01:15:29,948 --> 01:15:31,117
<i>Alex...</i>

663
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:40,027
<i>Alex...</i>

664
01:17:39,177 --> 01:17:40,113
Alex.

665
01:17:42,148 --> 01:17:43,182
Alex Lainey.

666
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:40,006
Is this us?

667
01:19:28,554 --> 01:19:29,623
It's okay.

668
01:21:00,779 --> 01:21:02,014
Am I dead?

669
01:21:07,286 --> 01:21:08,421
That's good.

670
01:22:10,582 --> 01:22:11,518
Alex...

671
01:22:13,551 --> 01:22:14,520
Alex.

672
01:22:15,887 --> 01:22:17,487
Don't go.

673
01:22:17,489 --> 01:22:18,490
Just stay.

674
01:22:24,296 --> 01:22:25,298
Let her go.

675
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:29,402
We're here.

676
01:22:30,469 --> 01:22:31,837
It'll get better now.

677
01:24:40,899 --> 01:24:41,868
Oh!

678
01:24:43,636 --> 01:24:46,606
Son of a... bag of tits. Shit!

679
01:24:53,511 --> 01:24:54,514
That was sick.

680
01:24:55,581 --> 01:24:56,783
Come on, let's go.

681
01:24:59,484 --> 01:25:00,987
Would have been sicker
if I landed.

682
01:25:02,954 --> 01:25:03,890
You'll get it.

683
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:09,996
You think they're going
to watch you forever?

684
01:25:11,829 --> 01:25:12,631
Yeah.

685
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:02,978
