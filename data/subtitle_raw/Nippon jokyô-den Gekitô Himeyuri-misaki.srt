Shinji, this is no time to be daydreaming!

15
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:13,863
I'm worried about my gas,
so I can't go any faster.

16
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:18,566
OK. I'll do something about that,
so just use what you have.

17
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,869
OK!

18
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,732
Don't dilly-dally!

19
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,514
See you later!

Isamu...

26
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,957
I guess that's where it all is.

27
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,016
Shall we have a little fun?

28
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:54,023
In other words, he's saying
he can't just give a pig that

29
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,298
wandered into a military zone back
that easily, so how about a date?

30
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,428
I think it might work out.

31
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,670
Let's challenge him
to a barrel with this.

32
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,586
You got a deal.

33
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,135
He said he wants
a date and a kiss and

34
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,578
if he loses he'll
give us two barrels.

35
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,273
Are you sure?

36
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,376
No way!
Is this truck number 32

37
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,646
This is the new addition
to Yonamine Transport.

38
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,414
This one is good.

39
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,682
It's great about getting a new
truck, but we have no gas.

40
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,024
We have to do something.

41
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,961
I told the boss, but...

42
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,931
Hey!

43
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,060
Look, we got three barrels!

44
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,002
Where did you get that?

45
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,438
The boss won it in a poker match.

46
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,746
You did it again. I thought
I told you not to do that.

47
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,214
The new truck is here...

48
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,984
We're going to have a party tonight!

49
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,334
What's tomorrow's schedule like?

50
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,108
This is it...

51
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,047
I'll drive tomorrow, so could
you watch the office?

52
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:34,242
I can't let you take
all the burden yourself.

53
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,924
Don't worry about it.

54
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,758
I'm just doing what my parents
did to build this company

55
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,923
to what it is today.

56
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,258
But...

57
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:50,896
If they didn't die in the war,
you wouldn't be doing this...

58
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,170
Don't talk about that!

59
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,871
I thought I made you promise
me that you wouldn't treat me

60
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,676
like a girl until I rebuild this
company to what it used to be.

61
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,821
I'm sorry.

62
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,264
Isamu... you look happy.
Did something happen?

63
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,767
We got a new truck, so I can
drive starting tomorrow.

64
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,942
You're finally a full-fledged driver.

65
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,876
Don't get too close in front
of all these people.

66
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,539
Why?

67
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:37,642
Our boss lost someone
she loved in the war.

68
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,714
I didn't know that.

69
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:52,496
Gunso, are you thinking about
the main island again?

70
00:08:55,902 --> 00:09:00,135
I'm fine when I'm working, but
I start to remember the past

71
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,040
when I come to places like this.

72
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,840
Was your home in Kumamoto?

73
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,675
Why don't you go home once?

74
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:17,146
Everyone thinks I was shot and
killed after escaping a POW camp.

75
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,523
I can't go home now...

76
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:35,003
I'm sure my wife
forgot about me by now.

77
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,619
Who are those guys?

78
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,557
They're some yakuza that
came from the main island.

79
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,356
They're always like this.

80
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,256
Don't let them get to you.

81
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,501
Would you like some flowers?

82
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,071
Give me one.

83
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,848
Me, too!

84
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,894
They're such cheap flowers.

85
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:33,855
Is this the only kind of flowers
you have in Okinawa?

86
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:38,064
I bet you have better flowers...

87
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,070
Stop that!

88
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,475
Are you all right?

89
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,411
You're quite a beauty.

90
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,419
You shouldn't be using
things like that...

91
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,862
The people of Okinawa
fight one on one.

92
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,928
I'm Okinawan.

93
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:16,499
I can't fight with a woman, but
anyone want to take me on?

94
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,568
I'll take you on.

95
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:29,144
I'm Daisuke Iba.
Third level Shuriken.

96
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,216
I'm Kensaku Yashiro. Judo.

97
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,846
That's it.

98
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,415
The fight is over.

99
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,823
We fight until someone dies.

100
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,422
Get out of the way.

101
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:49,800
Are you dissatisfied with my judgment?

102
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,861
Your judgment?

103
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:54,670
I don't need to be humiliated.
Teach me something.

104
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,198
Very well.

105
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,006
Stop right there.

106
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:06,482
You're quite the brave one.

107
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,783
I'm Iwamatsu.

108
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,155
I hear you own a trucking company.

109
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,148
I'm Yuri Yonamine.

110
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:20,489
I run a business as well.

111
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:24,697
Can we just call it water under
the bridge and talk business?

112
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,604
Unfortunately, I have work to do, so...

113
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,989
I'm sorry we got in
the way of your work.

114
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,328
I'll buy all of that.

115
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,995
I'll hold it.

116
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,834
Thank you.

117
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:07,535
I wish you would stop
doing this kind of work.

118
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:08,536
Yes...

119
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:13,375
But, my village has a lot of
debt and we all have to

120
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,844
work or we won't be
able to repay the debt.

121
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,551
Where is your village?

122
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:21,583
Aragusuku in Gushikami.

123
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,722
Aragusuku?

124
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,292
Boss, I'll take her home.

125
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,735
I'm fine.
I always walk home when I'm late.

126
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,106
Why don't you stay
at my place tonight?

127
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,976
I'll take you home with
my car in the morning.

128
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,112
Thank you.

129
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,450
What happened to your leg?

130
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:56,122
I hurt it when I was little in the war.

131
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,331
What about your family?

132
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,858
My grandmother and I
are the only survivors.

133
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,137
Have a good night's rest.

134
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,838
This cave is completely
surrounded by the U.S.

135
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,970
We will prepare ourselves
to proudly sacrifice our lives

136
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,709
for our country.

137
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,584
Follow me!

138
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,086
For those who don't follow me,
I want you to use

139
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:32,285
the weapons I just gave
you to take your lives.

140
00:16:55,547 --> 00:17:00,610
Father... Mother...

141
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:06,925
You're still young.
You don't have to die. Escape.

142
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:16,334
I don't need this anymore.

143
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:27,542
I have a younger sister that
is about the same age as you.

144
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:30,846
I was told she died in an air raid.

145
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,754
Don't die.

146
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,700
Be careful.

147
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,008
Thank you very much.

148
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,880
I'll walk you home.

149
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,621
Do you know the house that was here?

150
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:31,365
No. Did it belong to someone you knew?

151
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,635
It's where my mother was born.

152
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:39,108
So you're from this village, too.

153
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:47,111
Yes, but all of my
relatives died in the war.

154
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,381
I haven't been here in a long time.

155
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,690
Sachiko, what happened
to you last night?

156
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,101
Your grandma was waiting for you.

157
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,641
I stayed at her place
since it was too late.

158
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:13,805
Thank you.
I'm Keisuke Asada, the mayor here.

159
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,042
I'm Yuri Yonamine.

160
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,914
Yuri?

161
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:23,045
So you're Rika's daughter.
She used to live here.

162
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,045
Yes.

163
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,020
Is that so?

164
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,089
I've heard about you.
I'm glad to see you doing well.

165
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:40,966
Your mother and I used to play
together when we were little.

166
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:47,035
This used to be a
quiet village back then.

167
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:51,004
This became a battleground
during the war where most

168
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:55,544
of the families in
this village have died.

169
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,188
How about your family?

170
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:05,460
Yes, my parents and my siblings.

171
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,525
I was away at war...

172
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:13,664
I'm still happy to be alive
even with this injury.

173
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,408
How about your mother?

174
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:23,439
She died with my father near Mabuni.

175
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,577
I see.

176
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:31,589
I'm sure you had a hard
time after the war.

177
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,615
No...

178
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,993
I was preoccupied with work
and never even had time to

179
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:39,860
think about my mother's hometown at all.

180
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:42,425
I learned for the first time
yesterday that you're

181
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,232
all struggling here.

182
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:47,034
Please tell me if there's
anything I can do.

183
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:56,843
We borrowed a lot of money
to start this sugarcane field.

184
00:21:56,848 --> 00:22:00,409
This land was bare until
last year and we felt we

185
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:04,822
had to do something, so
we borrowed some money

186
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,918
from a loan company and
planted these sugarcanes

187
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:11,054
from seedlings that we got from Hawaii.

188
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:14,897
The sugarcane is doing well,
but we aren't able

189
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,666
to pay the monthly interest
on the loan, and if we don't

190
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:23,870
do something, all of our profits
will be taken away after November.

191
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:27,004
I'm responsible for all of this,
but everyone has

192
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,913
been helping selling flowers and such...

193
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,649
How much did you borrow?

194
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,985
12,000 dollars.

195
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:44,419
Our village is so poor.

196
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,330
We don't have anything we
could soil to make money.

197
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:56,574
All we have are just these things.

198
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,576
Are there more?

199
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,669
Yes.

200
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:03,046
We found a lot when we
were cultivating the land.

201
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,709
We put them all at that
garbage dump over there.

202
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:10,018
Price for scrap has gone up.
Why don't you sell these?

203
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:16,358
We thought about it, but we don't
have any means to transport it.

204
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:18,693
I'll help you.

205
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,598
But, you have other
jobs to take care of.

206
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,468
I don't mind. Please allow me.

207
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,098
Yuri...

208
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,659
Hey! The truck is here!

209
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,627
What do you think you're doing?

210
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,961
I'm sorry.

211
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,763
Sony?

212
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:31,361
We work here. Be careful, you fool!

213
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,276
I'm the supervisor here.

214
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,378
Please have a seat.

215
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:53,050
You seem quite busy.

216
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,492
Let me get right to the point.

217
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:58,690
How much per ton will you
give us for today's delivery?

218
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:02,132
It doesn't look like you have
anything of much value.

219
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:05,467
It would help us greatly if you
would buy it at market price.

220
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,338
Our village depends on it.

221
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,538
The policy says that we only
need to pay you a service fee

222
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:17,175
for bringing the scrap since the U.S.
military takes care of all of that.

223
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,345
Yes, but it goes for 50 dollars
per ton when handed off

224
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:25,313
to the U.S. military and 10 times as
much when it's sold to the main island.

225
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,520
We can have you take it back
if you're going to be trouble.

226
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,394
We're the only ones that have
been granted special rights

227
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:35,856
to gather these scraps.

228
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:39,861
You should watch your attitude here.

229
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,641
I apologize if I was rude.

230
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,667
I'm making a request.

231
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,510
We haven't settled our fight
from last night either.

232
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:54,543
Let me think about it.

233
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,924
Will you be able to pay for it now?

234
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,792
After it sells.

235
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:06,458
That's fine. Thank you very much.

236
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,208
Aren't you the mayor of Aragusuku?

237
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,238
Yes.

238
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,271
I'm asking you this as a personal favor.

239
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,749
Could you deliver this to my family?

240
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,449
I can't leave this place since
they're watching me.

241
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,549
Watching you?

242
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,327
They're putting the scraps
on a black market ship.

243
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,696
What?

244
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:41,757
Please...

245
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:59,878
I heard rumors, but
I can't believe it's true.

246
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:04,515
Boss, we found this in the
scrap that they just brought.

247
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,355
Is it a live bomb?

248
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:12,559
No, this is an old Japanese artillery.

249
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,760
It belonged to the Japanese military?

250
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,827
Boss, I heard about a cave
near Aragusuku that they

251
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,897
used as a storage for artillery.

252
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,804
This might be...

253
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,000
Are there a lot of caves near Aragusuku?

254
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,145
Yes.

255
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:32,344
If the storage is untouched
then there must be a lot.

256
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,320
The U.S. military doesn't know
about it, so this would be a

257
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,779
huge treasure chest to send to Hong Kong.

258
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,122
This is interesting.

259
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:45,256
Let's get that artillery and
make some money.

260
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:50,827
Iba, I want you to be the
lead and check it out.

261
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:52,403
Yes.

262
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,169
Stop.

263
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:04,347
You can't go through past this point.

264
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,377
On whose orders?

265
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,217
We're representatives of the military.

266
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,052
Just do as we say.

267
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,885
Get out of here.

268
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,743
How's it going?

269
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,614
I want you to be thorough.

270
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:01,072
What are you doing?

271
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,234
Stop!

272
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:08,269
The sugarcane is our livelihood!

273
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,111
Stop!

274
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,346
Please make them stop.

275
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,685
We need to do this for
our excavation project.

276
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,679
I hope you're going to
compensate us for this.

277
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,920
Just plant it again.

278
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:21,915
You...

279
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:28,889
There are a lot of soldiers'
remains in this cave!

280
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:34,802
I'm responsible for this property until
all of those remains are removed!

281
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,574
I won't let you do this!

282
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:39,134
Just do as you want.

283
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:41,511
I'm going to go ahead with out plans.

284
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,250
Ma'am!

285
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,904
And you call yourselves Japanese?

286
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:16,075
Do you know how hard these people
worked to plant this sugarcane?

287
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,540
Mr. Iba, you're an Okinawan.
I'm sure you understand.

288
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:27,221
Just get out of here.

289
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:30,160
I'm not going to move until
you leave this place.

290
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,630
Yuri, let me handle this.

291
00:30:33,765 --> 00:30:37,599
Mr. Iwamatsu, if you insist
on continuing your work,

292
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,832
then I have a plan as well.

293
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,000
I'm going to confirm with
the military whether your

294
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,405
actions are legal or not.

295
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,839
That's fine.

296
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:48,174
I have a friend that's an officer.

297
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,275
Would you like me to
introduce you to him?

298
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:56,152
I'm going to ask about your black
market in Hong Kong as well!

299
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:01,154
I don't know what you're
talking about, but do

300
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,127
whatever you want!

301
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,293
Help me!

302
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:14,704
Boss, it seems he asked
them to deliver a message.

303
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,336
I just wanted to send my
wife and kids some money.

304
00:31:18,343 --> 00:31:22,610
I was paying you so well.
You're such a fool.

305
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:49,365
I was able to figure most of it out.

306
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:50,842
How was it?

307
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,311
Toyo Industries is registered
under a foreign name and

308
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,712
it seems Iwamatsu owns
the rights to the company.

309
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:58,045
It seems they use that
foreigner to get the ship

310
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:01,041
to transport the scraps to Hong Kong.

311
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,817
Unfortunately, I don't know what port.

312
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,620
What's the foreigner's name?

313
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,285
James Harrison.

314
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,556
That's all I need to know.

315
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,187
I'm going to see the general.

316
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:12,720
I'll go with you.

317
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,425
No, I'll be fine by myself.

318
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,366
Please pretend that you
don't know anything if

319
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,062
the U.S. military asks you.

320
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,880
Mayor!

321
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,755
Mr. Asato!

322
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:50,929
Yuri...

323
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:55,133
Please take care of the sugarcane field.

324
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,077
Mr. Asato!

325
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:10,444
You must be Mr. Nakagami.

326
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:14,009
I work for the Iwamatsu group.
I'm here to pick you up.

327
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,884
Please...

328
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,521
Iwamatsu group?

329
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:24,359
You have the wrong person.

330
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,854
Wait a minute. Just get in.

331
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:35,534
Sit there and wait.

332
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:38,033
Are you deaf?

333
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,875
You fool!

334
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:49,453
Don't be rude to our guest.

335
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:58,591
Mr. Nakagami, I'm sorry for the
way my boys are behaving.

336
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:02,294
I'm Gunji Iwamatsu of the
Iwamatsu group of Kyushu.

337
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,565
I guess you know who I am.

338
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:09,768
I'm Nakagami from Tokyo,
but what do you want from me?

339
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:15,512
This is a newspaper
from the main island.

340
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,915
There's a huge article.

341
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:21,351
NAKAGAMI GROUP LEADER...
NATIONWIDE SEARCH!

342
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,480
I received a message from
my office in Kyushu that

343
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,153
you were going to
enter Okinawa illegally.

344
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,867
I thought it would be rude
if we ignored that message,

345
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,894
so I sent my boys to pick you up.

346
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,534
Please enjoy yourself
while you're here.

347
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:47,303
Thank you for your
hospitality, but I've

348
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:50,872
been a lone wolf my entire life.

349
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:54,648
I don't want to be obligated to anyone.

350
00:35:54,652 --> 00:36:00,557
I fought against the Americans
here during the war.

351
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:08,323
I lost a lot of men...

352
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,199
...And there are those I want to see.

353
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:14,500
So, please don't worry about me.

354
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:17,770
I just want to relax
and walk around town.

355
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,447
If that's what you want.

356
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:27,680
But please let us know if
we can be of any help.

357
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:35,457
Would you be able to loan me a car?

358
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:36,984
Sure.

359
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:05,155
That guy...

360
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:28,236
Oh, be quiet.

361
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:33,076
He's so persistent.

362
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,227
Be careful!

363
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,408
Right back at you!

364
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,842
Is there some rule that
says I can't pass you?

365
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,869
We drive on the right
in Okinawa, so if you

366
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,506
want to pass someone
you pass them on the left.

367
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:07,951
I forgot. I was wrong.

368
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:11,580
But you sure are rough.
I can't believe you're a woman.

369
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,921
I'm not a woman.

370
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,188
Do what you want.

371
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:28,965
What's with that guy?

372
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,590
Where are you headed for?

373
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:54,223
To Aragusuku.

374
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:57,292
Were you hired by Iwamatsu, too?

375
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,828
No, but I'm surprised
you're so informed.

376
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,874
You're going to help him
dig up some artillery, rights?

377
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,434
Artillery?

378
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,502
I'm going to see some friends.

379
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:13,006
So you were in the
battle here in Okinawa?

380
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:16,247
We lost the war while I was
injured in the hospital.

381
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:24,427
I'm going to see the man
who saved my life.

382
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:28,194
I heard he's the mayor of Aragusuku now.

383
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,691
Is his name Asato?

384
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:32,760
Yes, do you know him?

385
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:38,266
Mr. Asato died.

386
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,271
Died?

387
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:45,981
We're laying him to rest today.

388
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:54,216
Hurry up!

389
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,454
Don't dilly-dally!

390
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,927
I know!

391
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,728
Hurry up!

392
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,664
Hurry up!

393
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,232
It looks like it would be around here.

394
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,673
Carry this.

395
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,320
That's so dangerous.

396
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:28,683
So are you saying Iwamatsu's
boys did this to him?

397
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:32,782
I can't confirm it,
but I'm sure they did.

398
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,326
He was a good man.

399
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,594
He would never have any enemies.

400
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,624
How dare they...

401
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:49,230
But, aren't you a yakuza like them?

402
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,951
Yoshiko...

403
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:15,627
Yoshiko...

404
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:23,037
Mom...

405
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:28,343
Mom!

406
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:35,250
Mom!

407
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:21,524
Mr. Iwamatsu.

408
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:22,795
Young lady...

409
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,598
I need to talk to you.

410
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,434
Let's have a drink.

411
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,098
This is no time to be drinking.

412
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,940
You...

413
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:36,140
Three mothers have died
because of you.

414
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:38,171
So what?

415
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:41,345
Mr. Iwamatsu, let's have you
pay for their compensation

416
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:45,311
and for the scrap that
we delivered to you.

417
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:49,852
Unfortunately, we'll be
handing it over to the

418
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:55,321
U.S. military since there were some
hazardous materials in that delivery.

419
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:57,733
We have nothing to do
with the three that died.

420
00:43:57,735 --> 00:44:01,330
They were careless, that's all.

421
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:03,807
You forced them to work there!

422
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,003
We didn't force anyone.

423
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:13,243
This is the deed for the land that the
mayor used as collateral to get the loan.

424
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,709
I paid it off for them.

425
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:21,055
We settled it by having the
people of Aragasuku pay

426
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:24,289
this off by working for us.

427
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:30,823
We have the new mayor's signature as well.

428
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:33,701
Do you still have more to say?

429
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,399
Go on home.

430
00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:38,875
Mr. Iwamatsu, I'm still not convinced.

431
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:41,436
If you insist on continuing
what you're doing, I'll

432
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:44,437
go directly to the GHQ myself.

433
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:48,009
I won't die that
easily like Mr. Asato.

434
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,383
You!

435
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,497
Don't be pulling things like that
in front of people.

436
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:09,073
Mr. Iwamatsu, it looks like you
have a lot going on here.

437
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:12,532
I know where that storage
that you're looking for is.

438
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:18,172
You?

439
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,343
I was the leader of the
heavy artillery regiment.

440
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:27,517
So I've been to the cave many
times to retrieve weapons.

441
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,151
Where is it?

442
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,718
Calm down.

443
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,561
It's been a while, so my
memory isn't too clear yet.

444
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,534
Why don't we sit down
and talk about it?

445
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,527
I have something to talk
to you about later.

446
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:43,029
Let me handle this and go on home.

447
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,411
Mr. Nakagami, please have a seat.

448
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:07,154
Please give this to the
children from today...

449
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:11,532
How about rethinking
what you're doing?

450
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:16,864
I have a criminal record,
so Iwamatsu was the only

451
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:18,968
one who would hire me.

452
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:42,422
I made Iwamatsu agree that he would
stop all work until I finish my research.

453
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,299
He's such a greedy fool.

454
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,862
I don't have to do any research.

455
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:49,464
And?

456
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:54,568
I want to borrow your truck.

457
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:57,570
If my calculations are correct,
we should be

458
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:00,175
able to transport all of the
artillery in three days

459
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:02,551
using all three trucks all day.

460
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:07,650
I talked to Shinwa Industries
to do this sale under the table.

461
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:14,319
That should take care of the debt.

462
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:18,493
I understand what you want to do, but

463
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,971
please get the money for the
children that lost

464
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,939
their mothers from Iwamatsu first.

465
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,341
We can use the money that we'll
get from selling the artillery.

466
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,209
I need you to do this or
I won't be able to trust you.

467
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:31,238
You're in the same business
as Iwamatsu, right?

468
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:34,650
The village people aren't going
to work for you otherwise.

469
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,050
Yes, I am a yakuza.

470
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:42,287
But I'm not like Iwamatsu.

471
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:45,853
I was known as Nakagami of Ginza.

472
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,161
I've never scammed a commoner.

473
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:51,624
Then I would like you to do
the right thing here.

474
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:54,161
I want to take revenge for Mr. Asato.

475
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:55,866
Don't you understand that?

476
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,035
I can't go to that village until
we compensate the children

477
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,408
for losing their mothers.

478
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,971
I was the reason why
this whole thing started.

479
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:05,710
All right.

480
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,651
I won't ask for your help!
You're so stubborn!

481
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,848
You're the one that's stubborn!

482
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:14,085
I can't believe you're a woman.

483
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:17,823
The Okinawan women I met
during the war were much cuter.

484
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,546
I think you should trust him.

485
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:06,838
The Okinawan women I met
during the war were much cuter.

486
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:33,883
Who's there?

487
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,657
It's you.

488
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,501
What are you doing here?

489
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,540
You're that girl?

490
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,726
Don't die.

491
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,292
Ma'am.

492
00:53:58,301 --> 00:54:00,360
I have some great news.

493
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,067
The fishermen have been
bringing up loads of

494
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,565
abandoned artillery
that are under water.

495
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,805
They just want the gunpowder, so they

496
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:10,473
don't know what to do with the scraps.

497
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,450
It seems they have enough
to fill two truckloads.

498
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:16,010
We can sell that without going
through Iwamatsu.

499
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:18,784
Yes, it's Shinwa Industries'
jurisdiction, so we should

500
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:22,656
be able to get enough to
compensate the children.

501
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:24,127
Let's go!

502
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:30,889
Thank you.

503
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,913
Gunso! Are you all right?

504
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:50,409
I can't move my legs.

505
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:52,612
Hold on!

506
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:08,636
It's a time bomb.

507
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,299
Boss, get out!

508
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,435
You, too!

509
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:16,310
It's a time bomb.
I must have triggered the timer.

510
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,448
Hurry! Get out of here.

511
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:23,613
Tell the everyone to take cover.

512
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,130
Run!

513
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,235
Please run!

514
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,668
What happened?

515
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,235
Mr. Nakagami, there's a man
stuck under a time bomb.

516
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:50,611
A time bomb?

517
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:56,047
Boss... don't worry about me.
Please get out of here.

518
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,480
Boss.

519
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:04,226
Mr. Nakagami..

520
00:56:07,497 --> 00:56:09,397
The timer is moving.

521
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:11,697
Get me some tools and don't
let anyone come

522
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,398
within 500 meters of this place.

523
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:15,803
Get out of here.

524
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:17,068
I'm going to help.

525
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:18,563
You fool!

526
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,134
I said go!

527
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:51,724
Gunso, do you remember
any military songs?

528
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:58,235
Sing it to me.

529
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:12,905
Ma'am!

530
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:44,443
It's done.

531
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:52,621
Thank you, Mr. Nakagami.

532
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,496
Yuri...

533
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,432
I came here because I wanted
to talk to you again.

534
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:20,213
I've become someone not
worthy of respect, but

535
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:25,177
you should go back to being
the cute girl you used to be.

536
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:28,556
You'll be happier that way.

537
01:00:29,759 --> 01:00:32,592
Please don't ruin the dream
of a man who

538
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:35,860
came all the way here to see you.

539
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:47,865
I don't like men from the main island.

540
01:00:56,986 --> 01:01:00,923
My late mother always said
people from the

541
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:04,587
main island were very nice,
but they all just

542
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:09,594
passed through Okinawa.

543
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:18,173
They never looked at the
reality of this island.

544
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:24,269
Those people who just
pass through this island

545
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,545
will never know how we really feel.

546
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:36,656
But, I'll help you from tomorrow.

547
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:26,366
It's here.

548
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:49,856
It's a pit viper.

549
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,889
It's over here.

550
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:33,473
Some of these still have their fuses,
so tell your men to be careful.

551
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:35,469
Yes.

552
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:40,377
Be careful.

553
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:01,433
Please let us help you.

554
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:04,668
This is dangerous, so please
don't come near here.

555
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:10,602
Thank you.

556
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:15,178
It's heavy.
Please be careful.

557
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:17,949
The rest of you can come this way.

558
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:21,450
Thank you.

559
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:40,665
That Nakagami...

560
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:42,974
Start the preparations.

561
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:46,040
Do whatever you need to do
to stop Nakagami.

562
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,881
I won't let you tell me no.

563
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,751
I understand.

564
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,996
Get it ready.

565
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:50,578
Thank you.

566
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:57,478
They're coming!

567
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:25,312
You idiot!

568
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:40,453
Isamu!

569
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,291
Isamu!

570
01:06:44,633 --> 01:06:46,158
Kanamaru!

571
01:06:47,503 --> 01:06:49,301
Isamu!

572
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:53,031
Nakagami, I'm here to take your life!

573
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:04,246
Do you work for Iwamatsu?

574
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:06,749
Mr. Iba...

575
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,030
Don't kill him.

576
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:54,628
Please spare his life. Please!

577
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:57,265
Yuri... He's...

578
01:07:57,273 --> 01:08:00,334
Mr. Iba... Go...

579
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:40,540
Isamu...

580
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:52,485
They were going to get
married next month.

581
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:12,245
Yes?

582
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:15,775
Is a man by the name of
Tetsu Nakagami here?

583
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:18,515
He's on suspicion of entering
illegally with a fake passport.

584
01:09:18,521 --> 01:09:20,956
We're going to search the premises.
Get out of my way.

585
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,925
Wait...

586
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:32,124
Please wait!

587
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:34,501
There's no one by that name here.

588
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:56,448
Iwamatsu ratted me out.

589
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:01,492
Don't be foolish.

590
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:04,467
Okinawa is not like Japan.
It's controlled by the U.S.

591
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:13,231
Let me handle Iwamatsu.

592
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:22,346
You should go back to the main island.

593
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:02,886
How do I get there?

594
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:10,393
I guess a person from Nagoya
can't communicate with

595
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:11,833
a person from Okinawa.

596
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:13,598
Nakagami...

597
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:20,132
No, he's not a fish monger.

598
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:21,041
Be quiet!

599
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:22,635
Nakagami!

600
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:24,135
Are you crazy?

601
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:25,272
That's right! What?

602
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:33,848
Excuse me. Let me cross.

603
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:39,089
It's so hot here in Okinawa.

604
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:04,209
Why I am running?
I didn't do anything.

605
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:11,926
I'm from Kanto...

606
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:14,157
Kanto is a big area...

607
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:18,100
I was born near Sumida River.

608
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:21,364
My grandparents were born
in Asakusa, too.

609
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:23,532
Please...

610
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:30,669
It's here.

611
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:32,204
Is he really here?

612
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:34,478
Gunso... this man is
looking for Mr. Nakagami.

613
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:36,815
Nice to meet you.

614
01:12:36,819 --> 01:12:38,548
Is that the office?

615
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:43,357
Ouch!

616
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,350
Hey!

617
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,125
Come out here!

618
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:52,300
Hide!

619
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:54,167
Boss...

620
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,900
I'm sorry, I didn't know it was you.

621
01:12:56,905 --> 01:12:58,464
I'm so sorry.

622
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:01,842
Why are you under the truck?

623
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:05,041
I've come to rescue you.

624
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:10,319
It's been a while.

625
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:12,185
That's dirty!

626
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:13,848
Fool.

627
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:15,290
Ouch.

628
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,801
Boss, the coast is clear.

629
01:13:34,843 --> 01:13:37,039
This is the only kind of place
I can have a drink

630
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:38,604
since they're all after me.

631
01:13:38,614 --> 01:13:40,412
Thank you for waiting.

632
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,975
How did you get here?

633
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:43,952
From Kagoshima...

634
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:46,284
That's creepy...

635
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:49,586
There's a hole...

636
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,582
The ear...

637
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:57,889
I entered here illegally.

638
01:13:57,933 --> 01:13:59,526
I'm sorry.

639
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:00,593
Yes...

640
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:03,467
Have some.

641
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:06,133
This? No way!

642
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:13,746
How did it go in Tokyo?

643
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:16,411
The Daitokai group came
to apologize to us.

644
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:20,048
One of their men testified that
you weren't at the scene.

645
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:21,819
I see.

646
01:14:21,824 --> 01:14:26,193
Boss... please come home
as soon as possible.

647
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:29,256
We have more territory and more jobs.

648
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:32,268
Everyone is waiting for you.

649
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:34,361
I did it...

650
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:38,330
It stinks.

651
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,037
I didn't think it would be good
to bring cash, so

652
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:44,307
I brought the checkbook and your stamp.

653
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,945
I'm not going home to Tokyo.

654
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:54,287
What did you just say?

655
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,348
I'm leaving the group.

656
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:04,395
I want you to talk it over with
everyone and manage the group.

657
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:06,959
Boss, are you serious?

658
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:16,142
I'll pay my respects
once I'm done here.

659
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:24,142
I have a favor to ask of you.

660
01:15:26,955 --> 01:15:31,984
Could you let me write any amount
I want as a severance pay?

661
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:35,622
Please tell them this
is my last request.

662
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:47,673
Boss... never mind about the money...

663
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:54,541
I guess it wasn't a good idea to
come to a place that's so hot.

664
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:57,383
You really do go senile...

665
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:24,672
Can't you walk faster?

666
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:29,314
Listen up!
You all have a 12,000 dollar debt!

667
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:31,377
You better work hard!

668
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:44,800
Boss, I have a favor to ask of you.

669
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,734
Could you stop making the women
and elderly do this hard labor?

670
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:50,603
- It's too dangerous.
- We don't have time.

671
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,938
We need to clean it all up
by today or tomorrow if

672
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:55,035
we want to put it on that
boat to Hong Kong.

673
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:57,205
But, we've had an accident before...

674
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:01,906
Who do you think you are
talking to me like that?

675
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:04,511
You can't even do one thing right.

676
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,947
Boss...

677
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:12,021
I can't take this anymore.

678
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:15,826
Please let me leave.

679
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:17,389
What?

680
01:17:17,399 --> 01:17:19,128
Please...

681
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:24,431
Boss...

682
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:27,238
Who do you think took you
in when you were

683
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:31,076
homeless and made you into
the man you are today?

684
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,781
How dare you forget that.

685
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:36,785
Iba, I'll take care of you later.

686
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:51,499
Hurry up!

687
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:02,341
She was hiding in the village.

688
01:18:06,214 --> 01:18:08,239
What do you think she could do?

689
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:10,081
What?

690
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,350
She's for our enjoyment!

691
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:23,724
Get back to work!

692
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:26,695
Let me go!

693
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,947
Help me!

694
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:43,611
Stop!

695
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:29,460
Look over there!

696
01:19:30,465 --> 01:19:32,524
Stay down.

697
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:46,014
They're threatening the
people with their guns

698
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:48,813
and doing things I can't bear to watch.

699
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:56,247
They have the entire village surrounded
and there's no way you can get in.

700
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,432
Here's 20,000 dollars.

701
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:14,739
Give this to the people of Aragusuku.

702
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:24,849
Just do as I say.

703
01:20:26,254 --> 01:20:28,416
Mr. Nakagami..

704
01:20:28,423 --> 01:20:30,517
Boss!

705
01:20:35,697 --> 01:20:37,096
Sachi...

706
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:39,800
Are you all right?

707
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:45,505
Mr. Iba...

708
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,305
Take him inside.

709
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:00,381
Mr. Iba!

710
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:09,086
Where is she?

711
01:21:12,934 --> 01:21:15,494
She's safe.

712
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:17,631
She's right here.

713
01:21:19,007 --> 01:21:22,170
Thank you, Mr. Iba.

714
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,508
I...

715
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:39,086
...couldn't even repay
you for your kindness.

716
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:40,084
No...

717
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:43,660
You're one of us!

718
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:51,401
Thank you.

719
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:55,771
Mr. Iba!

720
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:27,969
Mr. Nakagami!

721
01:22:27,976 --> 01:22:29,410
Get off!

722
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,503
I'm coming with you.

723
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:34,005
This is not something
a woman should do.

724
01:22:41,823 --> 01:22:43,348
Fool!

725
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:50,190
I'm not going back to the main island.

726
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:52,360
Just let me do as I please.

727
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:16,680
Boss!

728
01:23:17,892 --> 01:23:19,485
Boss!

729
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:24,198
Miss Yuri!

730
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:39,268
Surround them!

731
01:24:43,611 --> 01:24:45,306
Find him!

732
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:52,512
There he is!

733
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:07,596
Mr. Nakagami!

734
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:14,674
Go!

735
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:44,768
Mr. Nakagami..

736
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:46,240
Yuri!

737
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:55,616
Find him!

738
01:25:58,453 --> 01:26:00,854
Don't let him get away!

739
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:06,155
Please go back to the main island.

740
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,890
I don't want to be a man
who just passes by.

741
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:17,596
I came here...

742
01:26:17,605 --> 01:26:20,404
...because I wanted to see you.

743
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:30,559
Mr. Nakagami!

744
01:29:30,565 --> 01:29:32,897
Never mind about me!
Go after him!

745
01:32:03,651 --> 01:32:07,519
Okinawa belongs to America.

746
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:11,618
No matter what the reason,
the crimes you have committed

747
01:32:11,626 --> 01:32:14,095
are heinous, however...

748
01:32:14,095 --> 01:32:16,826
Yuri Yonamine, you are
declared innocent and

749
01:32:16,831 --> 01:32:19,300
will be released immediately.

750
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:23,971
According to Tetsu Nakagami's
statement and our investigation,

751
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:30,377
we determined that he shall hold
the burden of this crime.

752
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:33,814
Please wait!

753
01:32:33,848 --> 01:32:35,976
He will be executed.

754
01:32:39,754 --> 01:32:41,586
Please wait!

755
01:32:41,589 --> 01:32:43,250
I did it!

756
01:32:43,257 --> 01:32:45,555
Please wait!

757
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:48,052
He didn't do it!

758
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:52,992
Mr. Nakagami!

759
01:32:56,037 --> 01:32:58,028
Don't die!

760
01:33:01,542 --> 01:33:03,169
Don't die!

761
01:33:03,177 --> 01:33:04,975
Mr. Nakagami!

762
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:13,687
Don't die!

763
01:33:13,688 --> 01:33:16,658
Mr. Nakagami!

764
01:34:30,798 --> 01:34:34,496
TETSU NAKAGAMI

765
01:35:40,668 --> 01:35:46,471
THE END
