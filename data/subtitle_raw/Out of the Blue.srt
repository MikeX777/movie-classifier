1
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:11,758
Good morning Rabelais.

2
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,051
Good morning Rabelais.

3
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,136
Good morning Rabelais.

4
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,127
He's burying a bone in
Mrs. Earthleigh's zinnias.

5
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:49,837
Who's burying a bone, dear?

6
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,840
That bachelor's dog from 10B.

7
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,968
I think it's going to
be hotter than yesterday.

8
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:57,220
They found another.

9
00:02:57,387 --> 00:02:58,387
Another what, dear?

10
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:01,224
Body, wrapped in a
blood stained blanket.

11
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:03,267
The fourth inside of a month.

12
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,019
It must be a fiend.

13
00:03:05,186 --> 00:03:07,563
Women are warned not
to go out after dark

14
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,149
until the Greenwich Village
Murderer has been caught.

15
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:12,819
Greenwich Village Murderer indeed.

16
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,154
He's probably from Uptown.

17
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:18,324
I, for one, shan't set
foot out of this building.

18
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:21,035
We've always been safe so far.

19
00:03:23,496 --> 00:03:24,622
There they are now.

20
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,457
- Who dear?
- The Earthleighs.

21
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:30,336
You forgot the sugar again!

22
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:33,005
Oh, yes dear.

23
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:37,218
He forgot the sugar again.

24
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:39,762
He's so forgetful.

25
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,437
That old maid on the 12th
floor's watching us again.

26
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:50,773
She's there every morning
at 8:05 like clockwork.

27
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,316
Don't look now Arthur!

28
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,114
Oh, oatmeal, oh yes.

29
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:59,615
It's Saturday.

30
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:01,951
Oh, we're in for
another scorcher,

31
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:03,619
should be cooler in Connecticut.

32
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:06,080
I do wish you were
coming with me.

33
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:07,331
Now Mae.

34
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:09,098
Well I was only
thinking of your comfort.

35
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,128
Cecelia does have that
breeze from the river.

36
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:14,464
The river gets that
breeze from Cecilia.

37
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:19,385
Arthur, you know I don't
like jokes about my sister.

38
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,680
My train leaves at 6:30.

39
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:24,682
You'll be there on time?

40
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:25,849
Of course, dear.

41
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,852
Oh, I hate leaving you alone.

42
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:30,688
If it weren't
Cecelia's anniversary,

43
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:33,399
but you must admit in the
seven years we've been married,

44
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:35,568
I haven't left you
alone very often.

45
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:38,029
Uh huh, that's right, dear.

46
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:40,239
And I appreciate it.

47
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:44,202
Arthur, can't you read
your newspaper on the bus?

48
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,245
I like to read it sitting down.

49
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:50,708
Arthur!

50
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,877
You're not going to smoke?

51
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:54,587
But this is not in the house!

52
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:56,756
All right, if you
must be technical

53
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:58,174
I'll bring you an ashtray.

54
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:01,052
Arthur, look!

55
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:02,762
My zinnias!

56
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:06,516
It's that dog, that artist's dog!

57
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,686
I knew, you see, a bone,
he's buried a bone!

58
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,688
Keep that for evidence.

59
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,982
Oh my poor, poor little zinnias.

60
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:19,445
Arthur, that dog has got to go.

61
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:21,823
This time you must be firm.

62
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,675
What do you
expect me to do about it?

63
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,077
What any man would do
to protect his own home.

64
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:28,037
This calls for action.

65
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:29,223
Of course, if you're afraid.

66
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:31,332
No, of course I'm not afraid.

67
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:34,460
Well, I'll talk to
him, here take this.

68
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:58,067
Why don't you answer it?

69
00:05:58,234 --> 00:05:59,026
Hello?

70
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,528
Galleo?

71
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:02,864
This is your neighbor,
Arthur Earthleigh.

72
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,491
My wife just unearthed a
bone in her flower box.

73
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:06,677
Tell her if no one calls for it

74
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:09,078
in 30 days she can keep it.

75
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:11,873
The bone happens to
belong to your dog.

76
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,308
Tell your wife she
can keep the bone,

77
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:14,792
I'll get my dog another.

78
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,087
But she doesn't want the bone!

79
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:20,089
Then why did she dig it up?

80
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:21,090
Now see here Galleo,

81
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:22,967
you've got to keep
him off this terrace.

82
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:25,219
No, no, he's got
to get rid of him.

83
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,929
You've got to get rid of him.

84
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:28,639
Get rid of Rabelais!

85
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:31,142
I'll get rid of you first!

86
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:32,309
Indeed, sir.

87
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,186
And just how do you
propose to do that?

88
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:37,231
There are ways,
Mr. Earthleigh.

89
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:38,917
You've got to get
rid of that dog today.

90
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:41,235
Now, give him away, sell him.

91
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:46,449
Mr. Galleo, please,
such language!

92
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:48,659
My wife is right at my elbow!

93
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,077
Well I'll bet she is

94
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,246
and gnawing on
Rabelais's bone no doubt.

95
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,473
Now look here, Mr. Earthleigh,

96
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,625
I don't mind your wife
stealing my dog's bone

97
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,419
but if you return that bone to
me in first class condition,

98
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,379
I'm willing to forget
the whole thing.

99
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:03,257
What's the matter?

100
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,051
He wants the bone back.

101
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,510
Arthur, really.

102
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:08,846
Mention the renting agent.

103
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,183
Galleo, if you
don't do what we say,

104
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,143
I'll notify the renting
agent immediately.

105
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,396
Oh, come on now, Earthleigh,
after all we're neighbors,

106
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,815
we both live on the 10th floor.

107
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:23,402
Do me a favor will
you, jump off!

108
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:28,616
Well?

109
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:29,783
He hung up.

110
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,543
Well don't just stand
there like a totem pole.

111
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:33,662
Do something!

112
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,580
I'll do something.

113
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:36,374
What?

114
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,210
Oh, well, I'll see my lawyer.

115
00:07:39,377 --> 00:07:40,544
Fine!

116
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,230
And tell him about the
parade of women that streams

117
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,215
through that bachelor's
apartment day and night.

118
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:46,050
Oh, those are his models.

119
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:47,343
Well, some of them must be.

120
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:11,200
Oh hello, pardon me.

121
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,786
- Have you a Mister...?
- 10B, step in.

122
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:18,165
- I'm looking for Mr. Galleo...
- I know, 10B.

123
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,332
Step in.

124
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,881
But how did you know
I wanted Mr. Galleo.

125
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:29,468
Well because you've got the
face and the figure for 10B.

126
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:30,928
- I have?
- Mm-hm.

127
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,306
Come in.

128
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,103
Hello Rabelais.

129
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,230
Well it's about
time you got here.

130
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:43,941
Mr. Galleo, I'm Deborah Tyler,

131
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:47,611
I tried to get you on the phone
but you're not listed so I...

132
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,214
That's all right,
I'll be right with you.

133
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:50,406
Just take off your clothes.

134
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:54,660
I beg your pardon?

135
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,590
Get undressed, as soon
as I finish breakfast

136
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:59,081
we'll go to work.

137
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,416
Just a minute, please.

138
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,918
Oh, I bet forgot to
bring a bathing suit, hm.

139
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,129
Well, there are couple in there.

140
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:07,131
Mr. Galleo, I'm not a model.

141
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:09,467
I came to see you
about Rabelais.

142
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:13,220
Rabelais, did he bury a
bone in your zinnias too?

143
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,221
What?

144
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,891
Did Arthur Earthleigh send you?

145
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:18,267
Who?

146
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:20,328
That guy next door, he just
phoned me about Rabelais.

147
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,021
Has he made you an offer?

148
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:23,856
I'll meet any terms
he may have proposed.

149
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:25,524
You can have your
choice, a flat rate,

150
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,234
pick of the litter or both.

151
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,737
Say, uh, who are you anyway?

152
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:32,239
Deborah Tyler, I own Zantippy.

153
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,406
That so?

154
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:34,158
What's Zantippy.

155
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:35,826
My prize Shepherd.

156
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,119
Oh.

157
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,597
When your Rabelais
took best of breed

158
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:41,123
at the Philadelphia show,
I'm from Philadelphia,

159
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,752
I decided then my Zantippy must
someday meet your Rabelais.

160
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,378
That's why I'm here.

161
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,089
Just a minute, Miss Tyler.

162
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,132
Rabelais, leave the room.

163
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:55,653
You see there's a
little wolf in Rabelais

164
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,324
and I wouldn't want him to
get the wrong impression.

165
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:58,348
Oh, I see.

166
00:09:58,474 --> 00:09:59,594
Now what's your proposition?

167
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:00,935
Anything you ask.

168
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,771
Anything?

169
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:06,190
Yes, I'll give anything
to arrange this match.

170
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:07,357
Sold.

171
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:10,736
You
haven't named a price.

172
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:13,030
Well you see Rabelais
really doesn't need any money.

173
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,037
He leads a very happy
life here in the village.

174
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,159
He has all the bones
he can possibly handle

175
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:18,911
and I don't want puppies.

176
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:21,205
Mr. Galleo, I came
here on business.

177
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:22,390
Art is my business,

178
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,041
I would like you to pose for me.

179
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,208
You're not serious?

180
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,710
Why not?
You pose for me,

181
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,077
Zantippy gets Rabelais and
they live happily ever after.

182
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:30,506
But I don't know the...

183
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:32,675
You have an interesting neck.
Your hands are good.

184
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:34,602
Of course, the face could
be a little longer.

185
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,138
It will be a little longer
if you don't get serious.

186
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,184
We'll try some quick
sketches just as you are...

187
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:41,684
No, no, better get
into a bathing suit.

188
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:44,311
Now, but, I have
a fitting at 10:30

189
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,188
and shopping and
a luncheon date.

190
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,435
I thought you were so crazy

191
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,191
to have Zantippy meet Rabelais.

192
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:50,358
Oh I am, but...

193
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,236
Well, then let's not
waste time talking,

194
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:55,030
I think I can find a bathing
suit that will fit you.

195
00:10:58,576 --> 00:10:59,576
Some iced tea dear?

196
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:05,583
Oh, relaxing always
makes me so tired.

197
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,294
It isn't the relaxing,

198
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,921
I think the heat
takes it out of us.

199
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,423
He's got another.

200
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,215
Another what, dear?

201
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,050
Another girl.

202
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,928
This one's prettier than
that redhead he had Thursday.

203
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:20,890
In broad daylight, where
do they think they are?

204
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,142
Parading around like that.

205
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:25,769
Nobody's forcing
you to look, dear.

206
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,526
Doris will never believe this.

207
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,153
Doris?

208
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,047
A friend I'm visiting, we
were roommates at Bryn Mawr.

209
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,949
Oh, I think half profile
will be better for this,

210
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:41,285
the light in your eyes
is nicer from that angle.

211
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,373
Sorry.

212
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,753
I just felt like doing
what comes naturally.

213
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,545
Naturally.

214
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,130
I really must be going.

215
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,089
Why, you've missed your
fitting your lunch date

216
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:55,674
and your tea date.

217
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,360
I can still make my
cocktail date if I hurry.

218
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,945
Oh, phone them and
tell them to come over,

219
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,013
I'll whip up some cocktails.

220
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,516
Please let me go.
Doris is waiting.

221
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:16,237
Ah, I wonder what we
ever saw in her, Rabelais?

222
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,863
She has ice in her veins.

223
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,089
All aboard!

224
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:38,259
- Stamford, Davenport.
- Mae, oh, excuse me, Mae.

225
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,969
- New Haven.
- You're late.

226
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,655
I know, I stopped to get
you a going away present.

227
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,055
Oh, chocolates, Arthur,

228
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,182
you know what they
do to my figure.

229
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:46,892
I'll bet you forgot
to see the lawyer.

230
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:48,703
No I didn't, saw
him first thing this morning.

231
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:49,353
You did!

232
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,604
What did he say?

233
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,523
Well, we may be better
off than we thought.

234
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,067
He's having the renting agent
write a letter to Galleo.

235
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:56,694
And if he doesn't
get rid of his dog,

236
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,860
we can have him evicted.

237
00:12:57,987 --> 00:12:59,113
Oh, wonderful.

238
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,699
I've always wanted that
apartment for Cecelia.

239
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:04,511
Well I'll take back
that better off.

240
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:05,929
I, uh, bought you a book
so you'll have something

241
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,454
to do while I'm away.

242
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,248
Above Reproach?

243
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:10,416
By Douglas Lord.

244
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,209
Mm, it's quite good.

245
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:14,420
I read the first three
chapters under the dryer.

246
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,672
Yeah, well then I'll
start with chapter four.

247
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,091
My train comes in
tomorrow night at 10:15 Arthur

248
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:21,093
and try to be on time.

249
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,095
Shall we synchronize
our watches?

250
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:25,889
Now, remember, don't
rush around in this heat,

251
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:27,975
don't spend over $2 for dinner,

252
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:31,312
nothing fried in deep
fat and no spaghetti.

253
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,872
Well, goodbye, and
have a good time.

254
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,398
Goodbye, you
have a good time.

255
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:36,066
Yeah, where?

256
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:40,154
Providence
and Boston, all aboard!

257
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,436
Good evening sir.

258
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,271
Hi. I guess there's no room.

259
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:16,899
Oh, we've got lot of
room, just wait 10 minutes.

260
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,386
You can enjoy
yourself by the bar.

261
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:19,484
I don't drink.

262
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,072
Well, you can eat some peanuts.

263
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,115
Check the gentleman hat.

264
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,283
Uh, this way please.

265
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:39,213
Yes sir.

266
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,506
Oh, no thanks,

267
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,092
I'm just waiting for
a table, on the wagon.

268
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,428
Those are habit forming too.

269
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:50,432
Above Reproach.

270
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,184
I don't believe it.

271
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:53,435
Sounds ghastly.

272
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,647
Well, I haven't read it yet.

273
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,440
Did I hear you say
you were on the wagon?

274
00:14:58,607 --> 00:14:59,607
So am I.

275
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:01,485
Technically.

276
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,904
This is a health
drink, made with lemons

277
00:15:04,071 --> 00:15:06,490
and cucumbers and
juniper berries.

278
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,242
Full of vitamins.

279
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:09,743
Couple of these
before every meal

280
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,453
and you'll never have scurvy.

281
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,664
Couple of those and
you'll never have the meal.

282
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,374
Danny, we want more vitamins.

283
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:16,291
No, no, no.

284
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,168
Not for me, just ginger ale.

285
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:22,297
Ginger ale, oh that's
very bad for you.

286
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:25,384
Do you know what happens to
people who drink ginger ale?

287
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:26,677
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

288
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,180
Fix him one of these, Danny.

289
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:31,515
No, really, I...

290
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:32,766
Do you want to have scurvy?

291
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,643
Ew, no!

292
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:38,897
You see, I've got to be
very careful, bad heart.

293
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:43,569
I'm liable to pop off right in
the middle of a conversation.

294
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,654
That's too bad,
I'm awfully sorry.

295
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,158
Well, here's to us.

296
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,081
Good?

297
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:59,126
Well it's like, like uh...

298
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,420
It's like drinking
a spring twilight.

299
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:04,590
Say, that's very poetic.

300
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,926
I used to write poetry when
I first came to the village.

301
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,093
Didn't pay.

302
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,680
Then I drifted into interiors.

303
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,850
You know my shop, Olive
and Patricia Interiors?

304
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,017
I'm Olive.

305
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,063
If you ever need any
chintzes, think of me.

306
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,191
Well, it wouldn't take a chintz

307
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,318
to make a man think
of you.

308
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:26,069
Shall we switch to martinis?

309
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,239
Would they mix with this?

310
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,427
They better or I'll
complain to the management.

311
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:33,911
Your table is ready sir.

312
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,163
- Oh.
- Oh no, let me.

313
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,080
I invited you.

314
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,416
Oh no, I wouldn't think of it.

315
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,251
I insist.

316
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,878
Well, all right.

317
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,594
Charge it, Danny.

318
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,555
Now, you must
have dinner with me.

319
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:54,890
I'll pay for dinner.

320
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,184
Thanks.

321
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:07,986
He's at it again.

322
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:09,279
In all this heat?

323
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,074
Nothing bothers him.

324
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:15,536
Well, aren't you
glad you stayed?

325
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:18,997
Where else in New York could
you dine so comfortably?

326
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,351
Just how long will it take
to finish this painting of me?

327
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:24,127
Ah, who knows, Da
Vinci took 20 years

328
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,546
to paint the Mona Lisa.

329
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,141
You're right. It's
absolutely wrong.

330
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,401
Thank you sir.

331
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:48,944
To us Duke.

332
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,591
Know what they
charge for that brandy?

333
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,656
90 cents a shot!

334
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:55,200
Why I have a fifth
of really fine brandy

335
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:58,036
at my apartment and
it only cost $6.60.

336
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,705
Imagine the profits
they make here,

337
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,165
why there must be 100 shots
of brandy in a bottle,

338
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,293
at 90 cents a shot!

339
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,254
Why that's $900 a bottle.

340
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:14,052
Either their profit is enormous
or my arithmetic is lousy.

341
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:20,267
Did you say you had some
brandy at your apartment?

342
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:23,103
Olive, you have a fine memory.

343
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:29,151
Would you, I mean, I'm just
around the corner at 35 East?

344
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,570
Would you, uh.

345
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:33,155
You talked me into it, let's go.

346
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:36,199
Well, I think it would
be better if you follow me,

347
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,160
I mean, our going in together

348
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:40,287
might start the
elevator boy talking.

349
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:44,166
You make it sound
very intriugish.

350
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,084
35 East.

351
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,753
Apartment 10A.

352
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,674
Oh, and uh, here's
$1 for the cab.

353
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,051
You better call a taxi.

354
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,928
- Taxi!
- Oh, not in here.

355
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:58,095
Outside.

356
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
Oh.

357
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,016
Eh, well, au revoir.

358
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,694
Keep the change my good man.

359
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:29,252
Nice poochy, nice poochy.

360
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,547
My good woman, that
dog is not a pooch.

361
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:36,134
And I am not your good
woman, so that makes us even.

362
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,143
10?

363
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,310
Yes, please.

364
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:54,903
Greenwich Village
Fiend still at large.

365
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,905
Story on page nine.

366
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,074
Would you like me to
turn to page nine?

367
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:02,202
Yes, please. A
girl just isn't safe

368
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,162
on the streets anymore is she?

369
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,329
You're so right.

370
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,542
Who knows where the
fiend may strike next.

371
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:12,170
On a deserted sidewalk,
under a shadowy tree,

372
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:15,757
or even in a crowded elevator.

373
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,056
Are you following me?

374
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,891
I'm sorry to
disappoint you madam,

375
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,102
but I'm not the Greenwich
Village Murderer.

376
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,312
Well, you slay me.

377
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,231
Touche.

378
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,275
Sashay.

379
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,954
- That you Olive?
- Hiya, Cookie!

380
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,038
Whoo!

381
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:50,584
Are you that glad to see me?

382
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,791
Well, it's a little late,
Olive, and I was afraid...

383
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:53,919
That I wasn't coming.

384
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,881
- Uh huh.
- Don't be silly Arthur.

385
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,048
Oh, uh, how did you know.

386
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,341
You forgot your book.

387
00:20:58,508 --> 00:20:59,134
Oh.

388
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:00,385
Your name is in it.

389
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:03,054
Arthur.

390
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,223
Arthur of the Round Table.

391
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:09,144
My knight in shining spectacles.

392
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,689
So this is where you live.

393
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:15,108
Your wife decorated?

394
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,275
Yes.

395
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:24,201
I like it.
It's in such exquisite bad taste.

396
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:25,647
I could have fun with this room.

397
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,138
I don't want to
have fun with the room

398
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:28,222
I'd like to have a
little fun in it.

399
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,623
What is it?

400
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,167
Ew, put that down,
Mae likes to find things

401
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:33,668
just as she left them.

402
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:36,421
Mae may not find anything
the way she left it.

403
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:38,590
I was enticed to this
place with the promise

404
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:40,926
of some very good brandy.

405
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,093
Here it is.

406
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,806
You know, brandy is
very good for my heart.

407
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:49,059
My doctor says it's
a vascular dilator

408
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:51,728
and my heart is liable
to stop like that

409
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:53,688
if I don't have
brandy periodically.

410
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:56,066
You don't think
you've had too much?

411
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,233
Oh, not too much.

412
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:00,570
Or I couldn't say, periodically.

413
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,951
I like it here, with a few
changes you could live in it.

414
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,417
What are you doing!

415
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:17,546
Oh, it's a lovely piano Arthur.

416
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:18,922
Why hide it.

417
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,800
Did you buy it on time?

418
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,135
Olive, it's after 10:30.

419
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,428
No music.

420
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:27,597
Oh stop acting
like a babysitter.

421
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:30,308
Oh, keep it there,
my wife's pineapples.

422
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:34,563
Relax Arthur and have some
fun, you'll live longer.

423
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,192
Sit down Arthur
and be comfortable.

424
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:41,736
You know something?

425
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:45,991
I'm beginning to like
you a lot, you're cute.

426
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,237
Well I like you too, Olive.

427
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,327
And I like you too, Arthur.

428
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,162
You know, if I
really let myself go,

429
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,248
I could fall in love with you.

430
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:54,415
But I'll bet you're used

431
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,960
to having women tell
you that, aren't you?

432
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,879
Well it's been some time.

433
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,088
Has it?

434
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,646
Now we're alone.

435
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,819
Could I get you some coffee?

436
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,408
Caffeine is very
bad for my heart.

437
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,619
Well, I think I'd better
make some for myself.

438
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:32,495
Don't run away Arthur.

439
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,956
Come over here closer.

440
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:36,499
You're beginning to blur.

441
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,460
Er, Olive.

442
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:39,794
Yes, Arthur?

443
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:42,088
Let's call it an
evening shall we?

444
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:44,174
Okay, it's an evening.

445
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:47,177
No, no, I mean, I think
I'd better take you home.

446
00:23:47,344 --> 00:23:49,804
That's taking a lot for granted.

447
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:50,971
But why?

448
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,600
How do you know I've got a home?

449
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,101
Well, I...

450
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,478
You're the cutest thing.

451
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,232
Olive, I'm going
to take you home.

452
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,860
Say, are you trying to
give me the brush off?

453
00:24:04,027 --> 00:24:05,111
Not exactly.

454
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,572
If you want me
to go, just say so.

455
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:09,199
I can take a hint.

456
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:12,219
A house doesn't have
to fall on my head.

457
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:12,953
I'll take you.

458
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,913
Oh no, you won't.

459
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,248
It's got to be a clean break.

460
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:20,168
No long drawn out farewells.

461
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:25,799
Oh, isn't that just like a man.

462
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:29,844
To send me out into the
night without my shoes.

463
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:32,889
I thought you were the one
friend I could call my friend,

464
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,367
but you're just
like all the rest.

465
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:35,517
I'll get a taxi.

466
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:38,979
Don't bother about
me, I'll be all right.

467
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,689
Get me a taxi, take me home.

468
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:41,856
Gallantry, gallantry.

469
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,567
Gallantry is dead.

470
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:46,486
Cold stone dead.

471
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:49,990
I hate men, all men.

472
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,450
Cruel, heartless, hideous.

473
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:55,245
Promising this and
promising that.

474
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:58,832
Then welshing this
and welshing that.

475
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,088
Hello?

476
00:25:55,597 --> 00:25:57,807
Oh, I'm coming.

477
00:25:58,683 --> 00:25:59,683
I'm coming.

478
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,028
♪ La, la, la ♪

479
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:10,820

480
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:13,948

482
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,534
Who's that?

483
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:18,620
- Come in.
- Who is it?

484
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:19,913
It's me.

485
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,872
Special delivery.

486
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,039
Open the door!

487
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,123
I can't, it's locked.

488
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,876
Not you, I'm talking to you.

489
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:26,544
I'm not dressed yet!

490
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:29,214
Is the lock stuck,
should I call the janitor?

491
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,091
No, I'll open it.

492
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:33,968
You don't have
to, I'll be out in a minute.

493
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:38,640
Good morning, special.

494
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:39,807
Oh, thank you.

495
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:40,975
I signed for it.

496
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,769
Well give
it to me and hurry up.

497
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:43,937
Here I come.

498
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,149
But my head is bending low.

499
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:49,818
What are you doing here?

500
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,027
Dressing.

501
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:52,194
Zip me please.

502
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,072
That, why,
that belongs to Mae,

503
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,073
it's her favorite housecoat.

504
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,491
Mine too.

505
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,368
My dress is a sight.

506
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:01,746
You shouldn't have let me
sleep in my clothes, Arthur.

507
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:03,164
Zip me.

508
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:04,934
Oh, I'd thought you'd
gone home, why didn't you?

509
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,793
And leave you all by yourself

510
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,753
to face the morning after alone?

511
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:12,507
What have you done
to the guest room?

512
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:15,009
Why you've changed everything.

513
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:16,216
Where are all the doodads?

514
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,054
I mean the things that
were on the things?

515
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:21,057
You mean all those
antimacassars and doilies?

516
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:24,144
Oh, I stashed them away in
one of the bureau drawers.

517
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,563
Oh, I hope I can remember
where everything was.

518
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:28,857
Grouchy this morning, aren't ya?

519
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,233
You need some breakfast.

520
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,484
I'm not hungry!

521
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,737
What a lovely, lovely morning.

522
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:36,304
Let's go for a drive
in the country,

523
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:37,615
you do have a car don't you?

524
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:38,533
Yes, I do, Olive.

525
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,844
You want me to take you home?

526
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:40,970
You should go home you know.

527
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:41,994
Should I?

528
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:45,281
If I didn't distinctly remember
your asking me up here,

529
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:47,167
I'd think I wasn't welcome.

530
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,210
Don't you like me anymore, Duke?

531
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:50,044
Oh yes.

532
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:51,211
But it's Sunday.

533
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,672
So it is.

534
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:53,590
So it is.

535
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:55,341
But it's a lovely Sunday.

536
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,218
Let's have breakfast
on the terrace.

537
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:58,219
No, no, no.

538
00:27:58,386 --> 00:27:59,220
You mustn't.

539
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:00,180
Why not?

540
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:02,223
I'll bet it's a lovely view.

541
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,892
You can't go out there.

542
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:06,561
What do you mean,
pushing me around?

543
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:10,732
You can't push me around
like an old beach umbrella.

544
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:13,776
Look, if I give you
breakfast will you go home?

545
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:16,529
Fine, just some
Melba toast and brandy.

546
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:17,947
Don't go to any trouble.

547
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:19,425
I'm going to have
some black coffee

548
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:20,992
and you're going
to have some too.

549
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:23,203
Oh no, you don't.

550
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,163
Just because you're
a caffeine addict,

551
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,332
don't think you can
drag me down with you.

552
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:30,084
Ew, Olive, please stay sober.

553
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:32,253
Doctor's orders, Duke.

554
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,588
Hm.

555
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,131
You forgot your
special delivery.

556
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:36,298
Hm.

557
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:38,091
From Mae?

558
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:39,218
No, my lawyer.

559
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:42,597
What did you do?

560
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:44,557
It's about a dog.

561
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:45,724
A neighbor's dog.

562
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,103
I'll start the coffee.

563
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:58,321
Copy of letter to
Mr. David Galleo.

564
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:03,409
Dear Mr. Galleo, acting on the
complaint of your neighbors,

565
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,993
you must either dispose of
your dog within 24 hours,

566
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:09,415
Or vacate the
premises immediately.

567
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:20,927
Good morning.

568
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:22,094
Come in, Deborah.

569
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:25,515
This is Sunday, and
you are Mr. Galleo,

570
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:28,059
the impulsive young artist
just panting to paint me?

571
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:31,562
24 hours, dispose of my dog.

572
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:33,273
Why, I'll tear
them limb from limb

573
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,316
and let Rabelais
bury their bones.

574
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:36,483
Remember me?

575
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:38,653
The name's Tyler, Deborah Tyler.

576
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,197
We met yesterday,
you asked me to pose.

577
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:42,591
Oh, what are you
bringing that back for,

578
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,450
don't you know it's
your death warrant?

579
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:47,495
Here, read this, that's
what's the matter with me!

580
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,456
They can't do this.

581
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:52,208
Or can they?

582
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,668
You know what I'm going to do,

583
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:56,629
I'm going next door and
crack that guys' skull.

584
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:57,880
I wouldn't do that.

585
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,367
Why not, let them
send me to jail.

586
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:00,745
That wouldn't solve the problem.

587
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:02,093
What do you want me to do?

588
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,887
Gather up my dog, put my tail
between my legs and sneak out?

589
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:06,889
David, you've got to
be sensible about this.

590
00:30:07,056 --> 00:30:08,182
Sensible?

591
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:09,410
You mean let them
walk all over me.

592
00:30:09,434 --> 00:30:11,311
Let them tell me how
to live and where.

593
00:30:13,521 --> 00:30:15,315
Go ahead, let off steam.

594
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,233
But I think my way's better.

595
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,152
And what is your way?

596
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,404
Well it's the dog
they object to, right?

597
00:30:21,571 --> 00:30:24,115
Why not give Rabelais a little
vacation in the country.

598
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:26,617
While he's gone, we'll find
a place that likes dogs.

599
00:30:26,784 --> 00:30:27,952
What do you mean,

600
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,346
a little vacation
in the country?

601
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,164
I know just the
place, in Westchester.

602
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:34,584
Zantippy was there for her
first litter, it's very nice.

603
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:35,460
A kennels!

604
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:36,753
I won't do it.

605
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,379
I won't put Rabelais
into a kennels.

606
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,175
- Thatta boy.
- Come on boy.

607
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:46,137
Give him Zantippy's
quarters, those were nice.

608
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:47,638
Goodbye Rabelais.

609
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:49,349
You want anything, just bark.

610
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:52,393
He'll be all right, really.

611
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,395
And you'll have
him back very soon.

612
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:56,397
I'm going to be
lost without him.

613
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:57,315
I know.

614
00:30:57,482 --> 00:30:58,941
I've always had a dog myself.

615
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:01,045
Debby, will you stick with
me for the rest of the day?

616
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:02,987
You mean, try to
take your dog's place?

617
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:04,794
I'm afraid you could
never take his place.

618
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:06,199
Well thanks for the trade last.

619
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:07,992
Why Rabelais' almost human.

620
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,159
So am I.

621
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:10,328
Now seriously speaking,

622
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:11,680
you don't know how much
I think of that dog.

623
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:12,705
Yes, I do.

624
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:13,915
I'll stick with you.

625
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:15,208

Mm-hm.

667
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:05,920
It's been a lovely evening.

668
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,714
Why the past tense?

669
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:10,174
The evening is just beginning.

670
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,179
Oh David, you have
a one track mind.

671
00:34:15,346 --> 00:34:16,931
Why don't you want to be kissed?

672
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:19,684
Might be habit forming.

673
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,435
Oh, and what do I have to do?

674
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:23,771
Get into striped
pants and cutaway

675
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:25,773
and wait for you at the
alter while you drift

676
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,568
down the aisle in orange
blossoms and lace?

677
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,611
Just for a kiss?

678
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:32,154
Not at all.

679
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,532
Just a simple country
wedding would suit me fine.

680
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,909
Debby, I value your
intelligence to highly

681
00:34:37,076 --> 00:34:39,537
to insult you with any
rational thoughts of marriage.

682
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:43,291
Are men still
saying that to girls.

683
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:46,377
And what makes you so
wise, that college degree?

684
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:49,005
Did they give courses in
the technique of love?

685
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:52,800
Yes, David, and I
majored in resistance.

686
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:29,712
I'll bet you thought it
was a special delivery.

687
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:31,130
Surprise.

688
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,090
On account of I
drank all of yours up

689
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:35,217
and I thought maybe your
wife would ask questions.

690
00:35:35,343 --> 00:35:36,969
Look Olive, I've
got to meet the train.

691
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:38,696
I was just leaving
to go to the station.

692
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,115
Maybe you'd better
keep the brandy.

693
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:42,183
But we didn't have
our farewell toast.

694
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,101
Olive, please, the train!

695
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:46,312
You didn't have
to sneak out on me.

696
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:48,105
Well I was nervous,
I wanted to check up

697
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:49,732
to see that everything
was in order.

698
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:51,817
Well, why didn't you say so.

699
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:53,778
I'd have been glad to
come back and help you.

700
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,624
Well it's all finished
now, shall we leave?

701
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:58,574
Just one last one
for farewell, Arthur.

702
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,159
It'll only take a minute.

703
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:02,203
But I washed all the glasses.

704
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:05,331
No drink, no go.

705
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:07,667
Olive, my wife's
train is traveling

706
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,794
in this direction
at 90 miles an hour.

707
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:13,172
I don't care if
your wife's train runs

708
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:16,550
right through this
room, do I get my drink?

709
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,886
Okay.

710
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:20,638
If you leave as soon
as you've had it.

711
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:22,485
You know what I'd like
to drink to, Arthur?

712
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:26,268
I'd like to drink to
Mrs. Average Housewife.

713
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:28,813
The backbone of our nation.

714
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:31,190
Is your wife the
backbone of our nation?

715
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:33,484
You leave Mae's
backbone out of this.

716
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:34,971
All right, then let's drink to...

717
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:37,363
Eh, just drink, no conversation.

718
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,530
All right, Arthur.

719
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:41,534
Now, we're signing off.

720
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:44,704
Hospitality is dead.

721
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,497
Cold stone dead.

725
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:59,343
Arthur, I just
realized something.

726
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,970
I love you.

727
00:37:01,137 --> 00:37:02,447
You can't! It's too late
and I only have a few minutes

728
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:03,824
to meet the train
and Mae will be furious...

729
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:05,182
Oh Mae, Mae.

730
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:07,476
We've done nothing
wrong, Arthur.

731
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,562
If you want me to
I'll stay right here

732
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:12,106
and explain the
whole thing to Mae.

733
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:14,108
Don't even joke
about such a thing.

734
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:16,402
You are joking aren't you?

735
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:18,946
You men are all alike.

736
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:21,157
Only thinking of yourselves.

737
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:23,200
You take the best
years of a girl's life.

738
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:24,511
I haven't known you for years.

739
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:25,695
Certainly not the best years.

740
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:27,705
The principle remains the same.

741
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:29,832
I'm not getting any
younger, Arthur.

742
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:32,752
That's completely
irrelevant, a non sequitur.

743
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:36,088
You watch your
language, Mr. Earthleigh.

744
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:37,631
Just because you picked me up

745
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:40,176
in a public bar doesn't
mean I'm not a woman

746
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:41,469
with a woman's feelings.

747
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:43,035
Oh Olive, will you
listen to reason,

748
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:44,430
we've got to get out of here.

749
00:37:45,473 --> 00:37:46,640
You pushed me.

750
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:47,951
All right, I pushed
you, I apologize,

751
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:49,226
but get up, we've got to go!

752
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:51,061
I wouldn't go anywhere with you.

753
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:53,063
I wouldn't be seen
walking in public...

754
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,356
I'm going to count three

755
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:56,734
and if you don't get
out of here I'm, one.

756
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:58,569
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself,

757
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:00,696
threatening me, you fiend.

758
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:02,615
And me with a weak heart.

759
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:04,325
I feel faint Arthur.

760
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:06,368
Well you're not fooling me, two!

761
00:38:06,535 --> 00:38:09,079
Arthur Earthleigh,
it isn't even a name.

762
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:10,080
It's a lisp.

763
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:11,247
- Three!
- Four!

764
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:13,769
- You're going home right now.
- Five, six.

765
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:15,544
- Quiet, sh.
- Seven!

Viola, the night

779
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,815
Excuse me.

780
00:39:17,982 --> 00:39:20,734
Another body found! Hey, extra!

781
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,069
Read all about it.

00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:25,114

Oh!

Oh.

786

Florence!

787
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:35,583
Please dear, I'm concentrating.

788
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:36,792
There's been a murder!

789
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:38,586
Will you ever remember
to shut the door?

790
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,129
I saw the body, I saw it.

791
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:41,296
Achoo!

792
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,800
Oh dear, if I catch cold
I'll never forgive you.

793
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:46,176
Body?

794
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:47,177
What body?

795
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:49,013
Send for the police.

796
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:50,848
Get me Mr. Galleo's apartment.

797
00:40:00,232 --> 00:40:01,232
David.

798
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:02,984
Phone's ringing.

799
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,864
It does that quite often.

800
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:08,198
Pay no attention.

801
00:40:08,365 --> 00:40:10,326
Better answer it.

802
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,581
Hello.

803
00:40:15,748 --> 00:40:17,249
Excuse me for disturbing you,

804
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,960
but I thought
you'd like to know.

805
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:24,006
There's a body on your
terrace. A dead body.

806
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:28,052
Oh, thank you very much.
Just leave it there.

807
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:43,317
What's the matter?

808
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:44,484
Oh!

809
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:48,321
Is she dead?

810
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:49,405
I don't think so.

811
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:53,243
How did she get here?

812
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:56,997
Get some smelling salts
in the medicine chest.

813
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:05,381
Ah, feeling any better?

814
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:08,926
How did I get here?

815
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:10,094
You tell me.

816
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:14,598
Oh, I know you, you're
the man with the dog.

817
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:16,183
I used to be.

818
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,244
There were no smelling
salts so I brought brandy.

819
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:19,603
I'll forgive you.

820
00:41:20,813 --> 00:41:24,900
Say do you know a
man about so low

821
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:26,235
by the name of Earthleigh?

822
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:28,237
Sure, he's my neighbor.

823
00:41:28,404 --> 00:41:29,154
He struck me.

824
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:30,155
He struck you?

825
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:31,322
No!

826
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,534
He knocked me cold
or else I fainted.

827
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:35,244
You see, I have a bad heart.

828
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:37,371
And when I pass out
I really pass out.

829
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:39,873
People tell me I
look positively dead.

830
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,376
Then Earthleigh must
have thought he killed you.

831
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,336
So he dumps you on my terrace.

832
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:47,089
Why that's terrible I
never heard of such a thing.

833
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:48,507
How do you like that.

834
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:50,968
You can't even bury a
bone on his terrace,

835
00:41:51,135 --> 00:41:53,637
but he can throw his
old dead bodies on mine.

836
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:55,305
Who's an old dead body!

837
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:57,850
Well he thought you were.

838
00:41:58,017 --> 00:42:01,020
Oh, isn't he a heel
though, that Earthleigh.

839
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:03,230
Why I might really
have been dead.

840
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:05,149
We ought to report
him to the police.

841
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:06,942
Oh, no, don't do that.

842
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:09,319
The scandal would
ruin me socially.

843
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:16,744
I'm afraid it's too late.

844
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,246
Sounds like somebody's
already called the police.

845
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:21,957
Wait a minute, girls.

846
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:24,501
This may be my chance
to get back Rabelais.

847
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:26,837
You'll have to help me
Deborah, and you too.

848
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:29,089
Anything you say, handsome.

849
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:31,884
It's right in line with
my good neighbor policy.

850
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:33,051
Now listen.

851
00:42:34,261 --> 00:42:35,596
- This the place?
- 10-4.

852
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:37,365
We don't need the assistance
of the junior crime club.

853
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,391
Yes, but I'm the one
who found the body.

854
00:42:39,558 --> 00:42:40,601
And I'm the accomplice.

855
00:42:40,768 --> 00:42:42,144
You're what?

856
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:44,188
I mean, we live together,
just above the crime.

857
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:46,106
Okay you two.

858
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:47,542
The rest of you go on home
and listen to your radios.

859
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:49,276
You'll hear about
it faster that way.

860
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:57,910
Come in.

861
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,412
We're from homicide

862
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:01,330
and we'll have to take
a look at your terrace.

863
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:02,664
I'll take it.

864
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:04,225
Oh, was one
of you ladies the one

865
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,085
who thought she saw
a body on my terrace?

866
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,251
I saw it.

867
00:43:07,336 --> 00:43:08,629
I'm afraid the lady's mistaken.

868
00:43:08,796 --> 00:43:09,505
No, I'm not.

869
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,590
I definitely saw a body.

870
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,095
Is this the body?

871
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,475
Well, is it?

872
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:25,104
Come on, was it?

873
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,107
Well it looked more dead.

874
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:29,900
Hysteria no doubt.

875
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:33,112
No, I tell you, I saw a
woman's body lying prone

876
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,488
on that terrace.

877
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:38,075
I always lie prone after
posing, it relaxes me.

878
00:43:38,242 --> 00:43:41,036
Oh,

879
00:43:41,203 --> 00:43:43,330
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.

880
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:45,391
Well, we're sorry
we've disappointed you.

881
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:47,167
We'll try to do
better the next time.

882
00:43:47,334 --> 00:43:48,585
I'd have a sworn it.

883
00:43:48,752 --> 00:43:51,296
If I hadn't seen her alive,
I'd have sworn she was dead.

884
00:43:51,463 --> 00:43:52,631
Come dear.

885
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:54,192
Nobody's got better
eyesight than I have.

886
00:43:54,216 --> 00:43:56,301
She was lying flat on her back.

887
00:44:01,807 --> 00:44:02,933
Success.

888
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:09,189
Oh, there's a body in there!

889
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:10,356
A body?

890
00:44:16,947 --> 00:44:19,199
Girls, I want you
to meet my first wife.

891
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:22,035
I keep her here purely
for sentimental reasons.

892
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:23,662
How do you do?

893
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:25,306
You ought to feed her
better, she looks anemic.

894
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,291
My first model when I
couldn't afford a live one,

895
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:29,084
given to me by an
artist who could.

896
00:44:29,251 --> 00:44:32,921
Pillar to post, poor thing
I know just how she feels.

897
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:35,424
This whole thing has
unnerved me terribly.

898
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:37,134
I'm just a bundle of nerves.

899
00:44:37,301 --> 00:44:40,053
You don't mind if I take a
little of your stimulant do you?

900
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:42,931
Another minute in that closet
and I'd have had an attack.

901
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:45,684
I'll just have to start
taking better care of myself.

902
00:44:51,106 --> 00:44:52,106
You know Olive,

903
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:54,359
I'm very glad you
unearthed this dummy.

904
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:56,195
They are about the same size.

905
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:57,404
She's skinnier.

906
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:58,697
She's our corpus delicti,

907
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:00,449
she's been in that
closet too long.

908
00:45:00,616 --> 00:45:02,492
It's about time she
had a decent burial.

909
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:07,164
Cecelia's coming in tomorrow

910
00:45:07,331 --> 00:45:09,166
to look at that man's apartment.

911
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:10,733
I hope he is stubborn
about that dog

912
00:45:10,876 --> 00:45:12,169
so we can have him evicted.

913
00:45:12,336 --> 00:45:13,336
Good evening.

914
00:45:13,462 --> 00:45:15,088
To bad you folks
didn't get here sooner.

915
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:16,673
You missed all the excitement.

916
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,175
Ow!

917
00:45:18,342 --> 00:45:20,636
Arthur, be more careful.

918
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:21,802
What excitement?

919
00:45:21,887 --> 00:45:22,888
The police just left.

920
00:45:23,055 --> 00:45:24,848
The old maids on
12 found a body.

921
00:45:25,015 --> 00:45:26,892
The old maids?
How'd it get there?

922
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:28,339
If those old maids found a body,

923
00:45:28,477 --> 00:45:30,187
they wouldn't report
it to the police.

924
00:45:30,354 --> 00:45:31,772
It was on the
terrace next to yours.

925
00:45:31,939 --> 00:45:34,650
Galleo's. One of his
models, I understand.

926
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:36,193
You mean, she was murdered?

927
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,819
Well it was...

928
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,088
Er, wait a minute son, we
don't care to hear anymore,

929
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:40,192
this is none of our affair.

930
00:45:40,322 --> 00:45:43,242
- Yeah but...
- But never mind.

931
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:44,408
Okay.

932
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,387
As soon as I hang
up my good things,

933
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:05,097
I'm gonna call
those two old maids

934
00:46:05,264 --> 00:46:06,584
and find out what
really happened.

935
00:46:06,682 --> 00:46:08,684
Oh, no, no Mae, let's
keep our nose out of this.

936
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,478
Why it might be a nasty scandal.

937
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:13,939
Arthur, what are
you so nervous about?

938
00:46:14,106 --> 00:46:14,731
Hm?

939
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:15,983
You've been nervous

940
00:46:16,149 --> 00:46:17,709
ever since you met
me five minutes late.

941
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:18,860
Something wrong?

942
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:21,321
Oh no, everything
is lovely, it's uh,

943
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:24,032
well it's just that I'm
so happy to have you home.

944
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:25,951
Oh how sweet.

945
00:46:26,118 --> 00:46:27,953
Did you have an awful
time without me.

946
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,163
Yes Mae, you have no idea.

947
00:46:31,957 --> 00:46:34,376
I think I'll get a
little fresh air.

948
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,318
Psst, Earthleigh.

949
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:02,154
Good evening neighbor,
uh, come here.

950
00:47:02,321 --> 00:47:04,031
I would like to have
a word with you.

951
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:06,033
If it's about your dog
it's out of my hands.

952
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:07,659
It isn't about my dog.

953
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:09,453
It's about the dead body.

954
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:11,079
The dead body?

955
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:14,291
Yes, I found a body on my
terrace about an hour ago.

956
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:16,752
- An hour ago?
- It was still warm.

957
00:47:17,586 --> 00:47:18,879
- You don't say?
- Mm hm.

958
00:47:19,046 --> 00:47:20,255
How did she get there?

959
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:22,257
Oh, you're brilliant Earthleigh.

960
00:47:22,424 --> 00:47:24,217
How did you guess it was a she?

961
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:26,970
Oh, well, so many
of them lately are.

962
00:47:27,137 --> 00:47:30,557
Exactly, and I might be
suspected of all those murders.

963
00:47:30,724 --> 00:47:32,559
What do you suppose I
ought to do about it?

964
00:47:32,726 --> 00:47:33,726
Arthur?

965
00:47:34,561 --> 00:47:36,605
For one thing,
speak a little softer.

966
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:39,107
Neighbor, I'm gonna
ask you to help me,

967
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:41,860
to show a little neighborliness.

968
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:42,778
What do you mean?

969
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:44,237
Well you see I'm an artist.

970
00:47:44,404 --> 00:47:47,741
A bohemian, everyone's ready
to think the worst of me.

971
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:50,869
But you, you're a
respectable man,

972
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:54,498
you're in business, no one
would suspect anything of you.

973
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:56,184
Just think of what
a story it will make

974
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:57,709
if I'd told him the truth.

975
00:47:57,876 --> 00:47:59,503
What a switch that would be.

976
00:47:59,669 --> 00:48:02,089
Arthur,
what's keeping you!

977
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:03,673
I'm coming.

978
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,385
Really Mr. Earthleigh
was dumping that poor girl

979
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:11,181
on my terrace your idea of
a decent Christian burial?

980
00:48:11,348 --> 00:48:13,850
I didn't have time to think.
I had to get rid of her.

981
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:16,436
And you're more accustomed
to handling women than I am.

982
00:48:16,603 --> 00:48:18,230
Not dead ones.

983
00:48:18,397 --> 00:48:19,606
Arthur!

984
00:48:19,773 --> 00:48:20,857
Did you call the police?

985
00:48:21,024 --> 00:48:22,418
They were here but
I got rid of them.

986
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:24,861
Uh, they don't suspect yet.

987
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:26,071
What do you want me to do?

988
00:48:26,238 --> 00:48:29,074
Not much, just help
me get rid of the body.

989
00:48:29,241 --> 00:48:31,201
I'll do anything you say.

990
00:48:31,368 --> 00:48:32,808
All right, I'll
call you at midnight.

991
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:33,703
Be prepared.

992
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,247
Prepared?

993
00:48:35,414 --> 00:48:37,666
Yes, old clothes,
there'll be digging to do.

994
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:41,253
Oh, uh, and one more thing.

995
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:46,174
Take care of this,
my eviction notice.

996
00:48:46,341 --> 00:48:48,176
This is blackmail, Mr. Galleo.

997
00:48:48,343 --> 00:48:50,762
You're so right,
Mr. Earthleigh.

998
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:08,654
Yes.

999
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:11,408
Yes, of course.

1000
00:49:11,575 --> 00:49:14,077
Yeah, I understand, right away.

1001
00:49:15,245 --> 00:49:17,247
Who was that Arthur?

1002
00:49:17,414 --> 00:49:18,665
That was the boss.

1003
00:49:18,832 --> 00:49:22,169
The big boss. Wants me to
drive him to the airport.

1004
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:24,504
At this time of night?

1005
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:27,424
Well, planes
leave at all hours, Mae.

1006
00:49:45,692 --> 00:49:48,153
Oh no, Olive,
that's going too far.

1007
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,863
I think she should have candles.

1008
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,448
- No, Olive.
- Yes.

1009
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,074
Whose body is this anyway?

1010
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:56,995
Oh yours, you zombie.
But I don't want it too well lit.

1011
00:49:57,162 --> 00:49:59,706
That was my trouble
when I was alive.

1012
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:01,333
Always too well lit.

1013
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:03,793
She does look like me though.

1014
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,795
Makes me feel kind of sad.

1015
00:50:05,962 --> 00:50:07,380
Poor Olive.

1016
00:50:07,547 --> 00:50:09,049
You were a good girl.

1017
00:50:09,216 --> 00:50:13,386
No one can say you were ever
anything but kind and good.

1018
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:16,973
Whose fault was it that
you ended up like this?

1019
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,768
Men, that's whose fault it was.

1020
00:50:19,935 --> 00:50:23,188
Men.

1021
00:50:23,355 --> 00:50:25,106
Arthur, you're not going

1022
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:27,150
to wear that outfit
to the airport.

1023
00:50:27,317 --> 00:50:28,527
Why not?

1024
00:50:28,693 --> 00:50:30,403
What would your boss think?

1025
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,197
You look like a tramp.

1026
00:50:32,364 --> 00:50:35,075
Well maybe he'll take
pity and offer me a raise.

1027
00:50:35,242 --> 00:50:38,578
You talk to him tonight about
that vice president's job.

1028
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:41,706
Tonight's the perfect time
to get in some spade work.

1029
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:49,089
Olive you shouldn't be here.

1030
00:50:49,256 --> 00:50:51,007
Don't you think you
ought to go home?

1031
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:53,134
In this?

1032
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:55,061
There are some dresses
in the models' closet,

1033
00:50:55,095 --> 00:50:56,295
grab one of those and beat it.

1034
00:50:56,429 --> 00:50:59,140
I want to go along
and see the fun.

1035
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:02,310
Maybe you can show us
how that can be arranged.

1036
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:04,688
Whose funeral is this anyway?

1037
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:06,064
Go home, Olive.

1038
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:08,900
Oh, there's Earthleigh now.

1039
00:51:09,067 --> 00:51:11,111
Into the closet, Olive.

1040
00:51:11,278 --> 00:51:12,278
Into the closet, Olive.

1041
00:51:12,362 --> 00:51:13,905
Out of my apartment, Olive.

1042
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:15,240
Go home, Olive.

1043
00:51:15,407 --> 00:51:18,910
Pillar to post, post to
pillar, where will it all end?

1044
00:51:19,077 --> 00:51:20,203
Sh, quiet, Olive!

1045
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:21,204
I'll take this
along for company.

1046
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:22,872
You do love company, don't you.

1047
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:31,172
Ah, what a well dressed
gravedigger will wear.

1048
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:34,050
Please, I'm in
no mood for joking.

1049
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:36,094
Well, there she is.

1050
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:38,221
You wouldn't want to have
a last look would you.

1051
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:39,388
No, thanks.

1052
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:40,472
I didn't think so.

1053
00:51:42,851 --> 00:51:44,894
As a matter of fact,
I was counting on it.

1054
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:50,585
Well, what are you
standing around moping for?

1055
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:51,609
Get a move on.

1056
00:51:51,735 --> 00:51:52,861
Do you want your rod?

1057
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:54,338
Quit talkin' so much
and do as you're told,

1058
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:55,488
of course I want my rod.

1059
00:51:55,655 --> 00:51:56,448
Loaded?

1060
00:51:56,615 --> 00:51:58,867
Sure, what do you think? Dope!

1061
00:51:59,034 --> 00:52:00,314
Is that young
lady to be trusted?

1062
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:01,596
Better be

1063
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:02,954
I know the most
perfect spot down

1064
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:05,040
in Westchester where
we can bury the body.

1065
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:06,206
- Westchester?
- Mm-hm.

1066
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:07,083
Here's your rod.

1067
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,084
Oh, what's that thing for!

1068
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:09,753
Oh, better safe than sorry.

1069
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:12,255
Say you'd better have a drink
old man, steady your nerves.

1070
00:52:12,422 --> 00:52:13,482
There's a bottle over there.

1071
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:14,966
Are you still here,

1072
00:52:15,133 --> 00:52:17,135
I thought I told you to
get that freight elevator.

1073
00:52:17,302 --> 00:52:18,571
I don't think I
know how to work it.

1074
00:52:18,595 --> 00:52:19,929
Okay half wit, I'll go with you.

1075
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:21,514
You stay here.

1076
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:18,738
Galleo! Oh, is
that you Galleo?

1077
00:53:18,905 --> 00:53:20,091
The strangest thing
just happened.

1078
00:53:20,115 --> 00:53:21,157
What's the matter?

1079
00:53:21,324 --> 00:53:22,426
Oh I feel faint now.

1080
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,243
Well you'd better
have another drink.

1081
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:24,410
But the bottle's gone,

1082
00:53:24,536 --> 00:53:25,763
it disappeared when
my back was turned.

1083
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:27,187
Ah, you're
imagining things.

1084
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:28,432
No, no the bottle
was there and then...

1085
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:30,375
Ah, you see it's still there.

1086
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,425
Uh oh, too late.

1087
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:40,135
Oh come on, no time to waste.

1088
00:53:41,761 --> 00:53:42,761
Give me a hand.

1089
00:53:45,515 --> 00:53:48,268
Here we go, ups-a-daisy.

1090
00:53:57,402 --> 00:54:02,240
Oh, it's a sad world. Sic transit
gloria... what was her name?

1091
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:03,241
Olive.

1092
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:05,368
Well, goodbye Olive.

1093
00:54:05,535 --> 00:54:06,870
Goodbye boys.

1094
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:15,211
Did you hear that voice?

1095
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:16,671
What voice?

1096
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:18,232
Earthleigh, you've
got to steal yourself,

1097
00:54:18,256 --> 00:54:19,591
you've got a tough night ahead.

1098
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,658
Did anyone see you?

1099
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:47,619
Ah, don't talk so much.

1100
00:54:47,786 --> 00:54:49,430
I don't know why I
didn't just turn you in,

1101
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:51,331
instead of helping
you out like this.

1102
00:54:51,498 --> 00:54:54,167
I guess I'm just a sucker
for a guy in a jam.

1103
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:56,169
Had some pretty
close shaves myself.

1104
00:54:56,336 --> 00:54:58,087
Never murder though,
I draw the line there.

1105
00:54:58,254 --> 00:55:00,507
Olive Jensen's death was
a regrettable accident,

1106
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:03,218
nothing more and you know it.

1107
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:06,054
Oh, red hair.

1108
00:55:06,221 --> 00:55:08,449
Evidence like this could send
you straight to the hot seat.

1109
00:55:08,473 --> 00:55:11,518
Oh, oh, uh, maybe we'd
better put it in the trunk.

1110
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:13,144
No, just blow it away.

1111
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:14,145
Oh, well you blow it.

1112
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:15,312
Oh, you blow it.

1113
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:31,162
Case the street.

1114
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:32,329
Gotcha.

1115
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:42,298
Everything is jake.

1116
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:44,092
Let's go.

1117
00:55:59,107 --> 00:56:00,441
It's a cop.

1118
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:02,944
Cop? Do you want
to get us all hanged?

1119
00:56:03,111 --> 00:56:06,239
You want to get us all hanged?

1120
00:56:06,406 --> 00:56:08,032
Let's go.

1121
00:56:12,871 --> 00:56:14,372
Sh!

1122
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:15,248
Butterfingers!

1123
00:56:15,415 --> 00:56:17,292
Sh!

1124
00:56:20,795 --> 00:56:22,715
Well, well, if it isn't
my friend Mr. Earthleigh.

1125
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:24,007
May I help you?

1126
00:56:24,173 --> 00:56:25,173
Oh no, thanks.

1127
00:56:26,551 --> 00:56:28,052
No trouble at all.

1128
00:56:28,219 --> 00:56:29,929
Oh, thank you very much.

1129
00:56:30,096 --> 00:56:32,098
That's all right, good night.

1130
00:56:32,265 --> 00:56:34,267
Good night.

1131
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,287
Earthleigh,
pull yourself together.

1132
00:56:54,454 --> 00:56:57,123
Come on.

1133
00:57:17,352 --> 00:57:19,103
I thought you said
this car could do 90.

1134
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,355
No, no!

1135
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,523
Come on step on
it, we can lose him.

1136
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:23,858
90!

1137
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:28,863
95!
No!

1138
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:30,114
- 100!
- Oh, could you.

1139
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:31,824
Step on it.

1140
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:55,180
Driver's license.

1141
00:57:57,308 --> 00:57:58,535
Where do you think
you're going to, a fire?

1142
00:57:58,559 --> 00:57:59,644
No, to a funeral.

1143
00:57:59,811 --> 00:58:01,062
Very funny.

1144
00:58:01,229 --> 00:58:02,289
What have you got in the trunk?

1145
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:04,065
A dead body.

1146
00:58:04,232 --> 00:58:06,025
Oh wise guy eh?

1147
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:07,402
Judge will take care of you.

1148
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:09,529
No respect for the dead.

1149
00:58:09,696 --> 00:58:11,489
Hey please, be quiet.

1150
00:58:11,656 --> 00:58:13,157
Take it easy from here on, bud.

1151
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:15,325
Keep it down.

1152
00:58:16,452 --> 00:58:18,913
Take care of that big
shot, you got influence.

1153
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:34,721
You're not taking
Olive to a dog kennel?

1154
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:36,597
Not Olive she was a nice girl.

1155
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:37,807
I'm picking up Rabelais.

1156
00:58:39,976 --> 00:58:41,352
I called them to get him ready.

1157
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:42,729
Your dog? At this hour?

1158
00:58:42,895 --> 00:58:44,188
An alibi my good man,

1159
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:45,749
in case anyone wonders
what you were doing

1160
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:46,813
in the woods at this hour.

1161
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:48,109
And stick to it pal,

1162
00:58:48,276 --> 00:58:50,778
even if they drive spikes
under your fingernails.

1163
00:58:50,945 --> 00:58:54,073
Remember, we're in this
thing together, no squealers.

1164
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,616
- Hey you Rabelais.
- Hi, Rabelais.

1165
00:58:55,783 --> 00:58:57,201
Come here, boy.

1166
00:58:57,368 --> 00:58:59,537
Come on, get in the back.
Get under there boy.

1167
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:04,959
- Thank you, I appreciate it.
- Good night.

1168
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:13,968
Get out.

1169
00:59:22,435 --> 00:59:23,561
Bring the spade.

1170
00:59:23,728 --> 00:59:24,728
Gotcha.

1171
00:59:38,326 --> 00:59:40,304
You go wait in the car.
If you see anything, signal.

1172
00:59:40,328 --> 00:59:41,829
I'll stand guard here.

1173
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:43,247
Gotcha.

1174
00:59:43,414 --> 00:59:46,459
Two by 2 1/2 by 3 1/2
oughtta do, start digging.

1175
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:11,150
Uh huh, that's just right.

1176
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:17,240
Ah, you take that end there.

1177
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:20,618
Well, one, two.

1178
01:00:21,911 --> 01:00:23,162
Wait a minute.

1179
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:24,431
Wouldn't you like
to say a few words,

1180
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:27,291
something short and to
the point, but reverent.

1181
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:29,292
Well.

1182
01:00:29,335 --> 01:00:31,212
She was a good girl.

1183
01:00:31,379 --> 01:00:32,380
She had a good heart.

1184
01:00:32,547 --> 01:00:34,090
A weak one, but a good one.

1185
01:00:34,257 --> 01:00:35,550
That's right.

1186
01:00:35,716 --> 01:00:37,969
No one could say anything but
that she was good and kind.

1187
01:00:38,136 --> 01:00:39,762
That's right, good and kind.

1188
01:00:39,929 --> 01:00:41,139
Thank you Arthur,

1189
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:43,185
that's exactly what Olive
would want you to say.

1190
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,768
Here we go.

1191
01:00:49,605 --> 01:00:51,107
Wouldn't you like
to do the honors?

1192
01:00:51,274 --> 01:00:52,793
I think you should throw
in the first spade.

1193
01:00:52,817 --> 01:00:54,819
- Oh no, no, thanks.
- Oh, go ahead.

1194
01:00:54,986 --> 01:00:56,279
Go ahead, yeah.

1195
01:01:01,534 --> 01:01:05,079
Olive Jensen, how
long she been missing?

1196
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:07,248
- Four days.
- Mm-hm.

1197
01:01:07,415 --> 01:01:08,708
Four days.

1198
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:11,502
Ever stay out before?

1199
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:13,588
Never more than three days.

1200
01:01:15,548 --> 01:01:16,548
Mm-hm.

1201
01:01:17,258 --> 01:01:19,844
Suspicious circumstances.

1202
01:01:20,011 --> 01:01:21,095
Description?

1203
01:01:21,262 --> 01:01:22,722
Well I though this might help.

1204
01:01:22,889 --> 01:01:25,433
It's several years old, but
it's still very much like her.

1205
01:01:30,229 --> 01:01:31,647
I'd sure hate

1206
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:33,750
to think the Greenwich Village
Murderer mutilated that.

1207
01:01:33,774 --> 01:01:35,318
I wouldn't worry too much, lady.

1208
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:37,820
A dame like that could
be missing five days

1209
01:01:37,987 --> 01:01:39,989
under the most
pleasant circumstances.

1210
01:01:40,156 --> 01:01:41,824
But you will try and find her.

1211
01:01:41,991 --> 01:01:43,159
Will we?

1212
01:01:43,326 --> 01:01:45,745
Well, here is my
address and phone number.

1213
01:01:45,912 --> 01:01:47,955
What's her address
and phone number?

1214
01:01:48,122 --> 01:01:49,248
The same.

1215
01:01:49,415 --> 01:01:51,209
Oh I hope nothing's
happened to Olive.

1216
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,002
I hope she's alive.

1217
01:01:53,169 --> 01:01:55,504
So do we lady, so do we.

1218
01:02:11,187 --> 01:02:13,189
Good morning, Deborah.

1219
01:02:14,273 --> 01:02:16,150
Are you still here?

1220
01:02:16,317 --> 01:02:17,568
I seem to be.

1221
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:18,735
Won't you come in?

1222
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:25,575
Where's David?

1223
01:02:25,701 --> 01:02:26,702
Asleep.

1224
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:27,620
Asleep?

1225
01:02:27,787 --> 01:02:29,664
Oh, we were up until all hours.

1226
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:33,084
He told me all about the
funeral, I nearly died.

1227
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:35,503
Quite cozy aren't we?

1228
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:37,004
Won't you sit down.

1229
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:38,005
How 'bout a cup of coffee?

1230
01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:39,172
I have some on the stove.

1231
01:02:39,257 --> 01:02:41,550
No thank you, I had
my breakfast hours ago.

1232
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:45,930
Cigarette?

1233
01:02:46,097 --> 01:02:47,348
No, thanks.

1234
01:02:47,515 --> 01:02:50,768
You know, I wish I'd
been at my funeral.

1235
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:52,687
I wish you had too.

1236
01:02:52,853 --> 01:02:54,188
Must have been a scream.

1237
01:02:54,355 --> 01:02:55,648
Davy told me all about it.

1238
01:02:55,815 --> 01:02:57,984
I never laughed so
much in my life.

1239
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,236
You should have
come back with him.

1240
01:03:00,403 --> 01:03:02,196
I bet you missed me terribly.

1241
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:03,363
You're not going?

1242
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:05,199
Davy wants you to
pose, doesn't he?

1243
01:03:05,366 --> 01:03:06,867
Why don't you do it?

1244
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:10,871
You have nice eyes,
your legs are good,

1245
01:03:11,038 --> 01:03:13,332
and that henna in your
hair could be toned down.

1246
01:03:13,499 --> 01:03:14,250
If I didn't
know you so well,

1247
01:03:14,417 --> 01:03:16,294
I'd say that was a dirty crack.

1248
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,421
You don't know me
at all, and it is!

1249
01:03:18,587 --> 01:03:19,797
What'll I tell David?

1250
01:03:21,173 --> 01:03:24,093
Tell him Zantippy has changed
her mind about Rabelais.

1251
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,178
She prefers someone
more discriminating.

1252
01:03:33,227 --> 01:03:35,354
Oh no, please, not again.

1253
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:38,190
You're not a
child, you're a grown man.

1254
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:42,153
Honestly when I think of you
out in the rain at midnight,

1255
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,071
changing your boss's
tire, wallowing in mud

1256
01:03:44,238 --> 01:03:46,008
up to your elbows,
catching your death of cold

1257
01:03:46,032 --> 01:03:48,409
It's not my fault
if we got a flat tire.

1258
01:03:48,576 --> 01:03:50,119
I didn't say it was.

1259
01:03:50,286 --> 01:03:52,246
You're always making
issues, Arthur.

1260
01:03:52,413 --> 01:03:54,433
Well I feel better now, I
think I'll go to the office.

1261
01:03:54,457 --> 01:03:56,125
You'll do no such thing.

1262
01:03:56,292 --> 01:03:58,652
If it hadn't been for your boss
you wouldn't have this cold.

1263
01:03:58,711 --> 01:03:59,837
I have a notion to call

1264
01:04:00,004 --> 01:04:01,356
and give him a good
piece of my mind.

1265
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:03,174
Oh, no, no, Mae, don't do that.

1266
01:04:03,341 --> 01:04:04,443
I'm going to get
you some hot lemonade,

1267
01:04:04,467 --> 01:04:06,635
you need something
to make you sweat.

1268
01:04:06,802 --> 01:04:07,636
Sweat?

1269
01:04:07,803 --> 01:04:09,083
I've done enough
of that already.

1270
01:04:57,853 --> 01:04:58,853
- Arthur?
- Yes!

1271
01:04:59,355 --> 01:05:01,357
Why Arthur, you look as
if you've seen a ghost.

1272
01:05:01,524 --> 01:05:03,317
A ghost, oh.

1273
01:05:03,484 --> 01:05:04,484
Where are you going?

1274
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:05,319
I want to see my lawyer.

1275
01:05:05,486 --> 01:05:06,904
- Like that?
- Oh.

1276
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,447
Arthur I refuse to let you leave

1277
01:05:08,614 --> 01:05:09,698
this house with that cold.

1278
01:05:09,865 --> 01:05:11,134
Well then, I'll have
to leave without it.

1279
01:05:11,158 --> 01:05:12,201
I gotta see my lawyer.

1280
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:16,455
Hey, corpus delicti, come here,

1281
01:05:16,622 --> 01:05:18,040
I've got something for you.

1282
01:05:18,207 --> 01:05:19,333
Hiya, cookie!

1283
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,209
Deborah not here yet?

1284
01:05:20,376 --> 01:05:21,752
My new dress.

1285
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,919
Hasn't she phoned?

1286
01:05:22,962 --> 01:05:26,340
Oh David, it's beautiful.

1287
01:05:26,507 --> 01:05:28,134
You shouldn't have
been so extravagant.

1288
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,177
Oh, well shrouds
come high this year.

1289
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:32,138
Say, come on and eat,
I want you out of here

1290
01:05:32,304 --> 01:05:33,304
when Deborah arrives.

1291
01:05:33,389 --> 01:05:35,057
I could kiss you for this.

1292
01:05:35,224 --> 01:05:37,059
Mm, I hope she's
not going to be late.

1293
01:05:37,226 --> 01:05:40,062
I want to try something new,
something entirely different.

1294
01:05:40,229 --> 01:05:42,273
I wouldn't waste time
planning it if I were you.

1295
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,233
Deborah's not coming back.

1296
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,651
Back, was she here?

1297
01:05:45,818 --> 01:05:47,236
Oh, hours ago.

1298
01:05:47,403 --> 01:05:50,156
She's probably half way
to Philadelphia by now.

1299
01:05:50,322 --> 01:05:51,907
Well why didn't she wait?

1300
01:05:52,074 --> 01:05:54,660
I don't think Deborah
likes you anymore.

1301
01:05:54,827 --> 01:05:55,953
She said to tell you

1302
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,955
Zantippy doesn't care
for Rabelais either.

1303
01:05:58,122 --> 01:05:59,540
- Oh, fine.
- Oh, come on

1304
01:05:59,707 --> 01:06:02,501
and have some coffee and
forget Philadelphia, David.

1305
01:06:02,668 --> 01:06:05,212
Go home Olive, you should
have gone home last night.

1306
01:06:05,379 --> 01:06:07,089
I didn't have anything to wear.

1307
01:06:07,256 --> 01:06:08,716
Well you have now.

1308
01:06:08,883 --> 01:06:10,217
Oh, I should have
carried you home

1309
01:06:10,384 --> 01:06:11,504
when I found you passed out,

1310
01:06:11,594 --> 01:06:13,194
instead of letting
you sleep it off here.

1311
01:06:13,345 --> 01:06:15,055
You're just like all the rest.

1312
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:17,391
You take the best years
of a girl's life...

1313
01:06:17,558 --> 01:06:19,018
Olive, go home!

1314
01:06:19,185 --> 01:06:20,644
If I find you here
when I come back,

1315
01:06:20,811 --> 01:06:22,229
I'll throttle you.

1316
01:06:22,396 --> 01:06:24,857
Come on Rabelais we've got to
square things with Deborah.

1317
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:28,860
I'll go.

1318
01:06:29,862 --> 01:06:31,447
I can take a hint

1319
01:06:38,496 --> 01:06:40,557
What's that dog left on
your terrace now, Earthleigh?

1320
01:06:40,581 --> 01:06:42,666
I wish it were only
a question of a dog.

1321
01:06:42,833 --> 01:06:44,001
This is murder.

1322
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:45,312
Don't tell me you
took the law and dog

1323
01:06:45,336 --> 01:06:46,605
in your own hands and killed it.

1324
01:06:46,629 --> 01:06:48,064
Well unfortunately
it isn't that simple.

1325
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:49,673
Look, here read that.

1326
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,217
Have you seen this girl?

1327
01:06:52,468 --> 01:06:54,720
Police are seeking the
whereabouts of Olive Jensen,

1328
01:06:54,887 --> 01:06:56,096
missing five days.

1329
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:58,015
It is feared she
may be the victim

1330
01:06:58,182 --> 01:06:59,767
of Greenwich Village Murderer.

1331
01:07:00,976 --> 01:07:02,853
Earthleigh, have you
murdered this woman?

1332
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,380
I won't talk until
I see my lawyer.

1333
01:07:04,522 --> 01:07:05,689
Well, who do you think I am?

1334
01:07:05,856 --> 01:07:08,192
- You, oh you, of course!
- All right.

1335
01:07:08,359 --> 01:07:10,194
Now, when did this happen?

1336
01:07:10,361 --> 01:07:11,070
Well it was done last night.

1337
01:07:11,237 --> 01:07:12,655
What time precisely?

1338
01:07:12,821 --> 01:07:14,073
My wife's train
got in at 10:15.

1339
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,366
And I had to get rid of her.

1340
01:07:15,533 --> 01:07:17,201
Well isn't murder
going a little far

1341
01:07:17,368 --> 01:07:18,494
to get rid of your wife?

1342
01:07:18,661 --> 01:07:20,162
No, not my wife,
this Olive person.

1343
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:21,556
If she was found
in my apartment,

1344
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:22,740
my wife would have killed me.

1345
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:24,875
Don't you or your wife
know any simpler way

1346
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:26,042
of getting rid of people?

1347
01:07:26,168 --> 01:07:27,461
I mean figuratively.

1348
01:07:27,628 --> 01:07:30,089
Figuratively, this is
beyond anything figurative.

1349
01:07:30,256 --> 01:07:32,424
Murder is a fact, a
fact you can't recall.

1350
01:07:32,591 --> 01:07:34,351
And without looking in
any book in my office,

1351
01:07:34,468 --> 01:07:35,678
I can tell you it's a crime

1352
01:07:35,844 --> 01:07:37,930
to kill anybody
in New York State.

1353
01:07:38,097 --> 01:07:40,099
Well I'm not entirely
ignorant of the law.

1354
01:07:40,266 --> 01:07:44,311
Well, how long was
her, the body, cold.

1355
01:07:44,478 --> 01:07:45,896
Ever since I met her.

1356
01:07:46,063 --> 01:07:47,783
No, no, I
don't mean cold socially,

1357
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:49,275
I mean cold physically.

1358
01:07:49,441 --> 01:07:51,610
Oh, about 18 hours.

1359
01:07:51,777 --> 01:07:53,529
And you failed to
notify the police?

1360
01:07:53,696 --> 01:07:54,822
Well I thought about it,

1361
01:07:54,989 --> 01:07:56,216
but I didn't know
what to tell them.

1362
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,158
I didn't want to get
involved in this thing.

1363
01:07:58,325 --> 01:07:59,743
Where'd you hide the body?

1364
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:03,038
I folded it in half, neatly,
and put it in an old trunk.

1365
01:08:03,205 --> 01:08:04,205
Are you serious?

1366
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:05,749
And last night, in Westchester,

1367
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:08,711
I buried the trunk behind The
Man's Best Friend Kennels.

1368
01:08:08,877 --> 01:08:10,796
Murder, concealment,

1369
01:08:10,963 --> 01:08:12,840
attempt to evade the
processes of law.

1370
01:08:13,007 --> 01:08:14,967
Earthleigh, are you
in your right mind?

1371
01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:15,884
Don't get personal!

1372
01:08:16,051 --> 01:08:17,136
I have to get personal!

1373
01:08:17,303 --> 01:08:18,905
Do you think it's going
to help my reputation

1374
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:20,365
if you go to the
electric chair for this?

1375
01:08:20,389 --> 01:08:21,974
Well then sue my
estate for damages.

1376
01:08:22,141 --> 01:08:24,143
Ordinarily I don't
take criminal cases.

1377
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:25,811
Ordinarily I
don't commit crimes.

1378
01:08:25,978 --> 01:08:27,247
So if you'll make
an exception for me,

1379
01:08:27,271 --> 01:08:28,271
I'll make one for you.

1380
01:08:28,355 --> 01:08:29,481
All right.

1381
01:08:29,648 --> 01:08:31,900
Now when was the last
time you saw her alive.

1382
01:08:32,067 --> 01:08:33,068
About an hour ago.

1383
01:08:33,235 --> 01:08:35,195
Well, her or her ghost.

1384
01:08:35,362 --> 01:08:37,740
But you buried her in a trunk
in Westchester last night!

1385
01:08:37,906 --> 01:08:39,950
But I saw her in my
apartment an hour ago.

1386
01:08:40,117 --> 01:08:42,202
Even Houdini couldn't
get out of a trunk buried

1387
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:43,409
in Westchester that quick.

1388
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:44,121
Well you don't know Olive.

1389
01:08:44,288 --> 01:08:45,581
What shall I do?

1390
01:08:45,748 --> 01:08:46,915
Do?

1391
01:08:47,082 --> 01:08:48,162
You've done enough already.

1392
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:49,436
Now wait a minute, let me think.

1393
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:50,586
Listen.

1394
01:08:50,753 --> 01:08:52,553
If you will follow my
instructions implicitly,

1395
01:08:52,588 --> 01:08:53,898
you'll have nothing
to worry about.

1396
01:08:53,922 --> 01:08:55,716
- Really?
- Absolutely.

1397
01:08:55,883 --> 01:08:58,260
I will take the
entire responsibility

1398
01:08:58,427 --> 01:08:59,779
and you can forget
the whole thing.

1399
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:01,096
Oh, well this is wonderful.

1400
01:09:01,263 --> 01:09:03,849
Now first, you must
tell me everything.

1401
01:09:04,016 --> 01:09:05,517
Deny it to everyone else.

1402
01:09:05,684 --> 01:09:07,019
You never knew the woman,

1403
01:09:07,186 --> 01:09:08,622
you don't know
anything about a body,

1404
01:09:08,646 --> 01:09:10,481
you've never seen a trunk.

1405
01:09:10,648 --> 01:09:12,149
And if anyone questions you,

1406
01:09:12,316 --> 01:09:15,110
you are to be shocked,
hurt and indignant.

1407
01:09:20,616 --> 01:09:22,618
- Well, it's about time.
- Not interested.

1408
01:09:22,785 --> 01:09:24,370
Oh Deborah, quit
being so Philadelphia,

1409
01:09:24,536 --> 01:09:26,080
I've been waiting
for you all day long,

1410
01:09:26,246 --> 01:09:27,665
I've done 20 crossword puzzles.

1411
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:28,957
Congratulations.

1412
01:09:29,124 --> 01:09:30,393
I never asked her
to stay all night.

1413
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:31,657
I just couldn't get rid of her.

1414
01:09:31,752 --> 01:09:33,087
You can't blame
me for being angry

1415
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:34,397
when I find a woman
making herself

1416
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:35,881
at home in your apartment.

1417
01:09:36,048 --> 01:09:38,300
I was just as angry, I
practically threw her out.

1418
01:09:38,467 --> 01:09:39,802
Deborah, she's not my type.

1419
01:09:39,968 --> 01:09:41,136
Don't you believe me?

1420
01:09:41,303 --> 01:09:43,806
Oh, this is beginning to
sound like a domestic quarrel.

1421
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:44,973
Well, I wish it were.

1422
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:48,686
I wish it were.

1423
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:51,438
Deborah, my tailor's
just around the corner.

1424
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:53,816
I could own striped pants
and cut away this evening.

1425
01:09:53,982 --> 01:09:54,982
How about it?

1426
01:09:56,318 --> 01:09:57,398
Did you hear that Rabelais,

1427
01:09:57,486 --> 01:09:59,154
your boss is proposing marriage.

1428
01:10:00,906 --> 01:10:02,146
Let's make it a double wedding,

1429
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:03,468
Zantippy and Rabelais
and you and me.

1430
01:10:03,492 --> 01:10:05,369
Well, could I let
you know at dinner?

1431
01:10:05,536 --> 01:10:07,663
I'll stop by for you at 7:30.

1432
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:10,207
No, I'll stop by for you.

1433
01:10:10,374 --> 01:10:13,419
Not that I don't trust you,
but I'll stop by for you.

1434
01:10:16,505 --> 01:10:17,631
Come on Rabelais.

1435
01:10:40,612 --> 01:10:42,489
Ah, you're not going
to wake up here.

1436
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:58,630
I'm supposed to be
playing this, dear.

1437
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:01,133
Excuse me.

1438
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:02,468
If this comes out,

1439
01:11:02,634 --> 01:11:05,220
I shall have made the greatest
scientific contribution

1440
01:11:05,387 --> 01:11:08,390
to the game of Patience
since, since Canfield.

1441
01:11:08,557 --> 01:11:09,557
Oh!

1442
01:11:10,476 --> 01:11:11,476
Oh!

1443
01:11:12,186 --> 01:11:14,104
What's wrong now, dear?

1444
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:17,065
Seeing things again?

1445
01:11:17,232 --> 01:11:18,232
Oh!

1446
01:11:23,363 --> 01:11:24,198
Hello?

1447
01:11:24,364 --> 01:11:25,616
Mrs. Earthleigh?

1448
01:11:25,783 --> 01:11:27,868
There's a body on your terrace.

1449
01:11:28,035 --> 01:11:30,704
Sorry, I don't believe
I heard you correctly.

1450
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:33,457
There's a body on your terrace.

1451
01:11:33,624 --> 01:11:36,668
On my terrace,
that's impossible!

1452
01:11:48,138 --> 01:11:49,681
Can we help you?

1453
01:11:49,848 --> 01:11:51,367
We thought we'd see you
before we called the police.

1454
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:53,185
I can't imagine
how she got there.

1455
01:11:53,352 --> 01:11:54,686
Where am I?

1456
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:56,897
Hi, girls.

1457
01:11:57,064 --> 01:11:58,774
- Oh, poor thing.
- Poor dear.

1458
01:11:58,941 --> 01:11:59,983
You're not dead.

1459
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:01,230
- No.
- We thought you were.

1460
01:12:01,276 --> 01:12:02,486
Help me get her to the couch.

1461
01:12:02,653 --> 01:12:04,422
In the cupboard there's
some brandy, bring it to me.

1462
01:12:04,446 --> 01:12:07,032
Just lie down here,
lie down here quietly.

1463
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,119
You've had an awful shock,
haven't you poor dear.

1464
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:11,703
Do you think you could
have a sip of brandy?

1465
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:12,663
I'll try.

1466
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:13,956
Don't mind the taste,

1467
01:12:14,122 --> 01:12:15,391
just think of the
good it will do you.

1468
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:16,959
There, feel better?

1469
01:12:18,168 --> 01:12:20,045
Maybe just a little more brandy?

1470
01:12:20,212 --> 01:12:21,564
- Oh.
- Oh, do you think she should?

1471
01:12:21,588 --> 01:12:22,965
Oh, it's a stimulant.

1472
01:12:23,131 --> 01:12:25,968
Now don't try to talk,
just tell us what happened?

1473
01:12:27,261 --> 01:12:28,887
He tried to kill me.

1474
01:12:29,054 --> 01:12:30,639
- Mr. Galleo?
- The artist?

1475
01:12:30,806 --> 01:12:33,100
- That bohemian?
- That monster.

1476
01:12:33,267 --> 01:12:34,601
Did he strike you?

1477
01:12:34,768 --> 01:12:37,354
Oh please don't
make me talk about it.

1478
01:12:37,521 --> 01:12:39,356
Maybe she needs a
little more stimulant.

1479
01:12:39,523 --> 01:12:41,191
Just give me the bottle.

1480
01:12:41,358 --> 01:12:42,943
You want us to call the police?

1481
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:46,029
Oh no, think of my
family, my reputation.

1482
01:12:46,196 --> 01:12:49,074
Oh are you a debutante, dear?

1483
01:12:50,409 --> 01:12:54,746
Yes, I came out in '38 and
I haven't been home since.

1484
01:12:56,248 --> 01:12:58,458
Were you posing for that fiend?

1485
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:00,919
He begged me to pose for him,

1486
01:13:01,086 --> 01:13:03,297
he told me he'd
make me immortal.

1487
01:13:03,463 --> 01:13:06,216
No punishment is bad
enough for a man like that.

1488
01:13:06,383 --> 01:13:08,343
I hope they string him up.

1489
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:10,220
Some ice water, my dear.

1490
01:13:10,387 --> 01:13:14,141
Oh my, she's fainted again!

1491
01:13:14,308 --> 01:13:15,517
Now, now what?

1492
01:13:15,684 --> 01:13:17,453
Oh, I don't know, I
wish my husband were here.

1493
01:13:17,477 --> 01:13:18,645
He'd know what to do.

1494
01:13:34,745 --> 01:13:35,972
Good evening Mae, I've
got a surprise for you.

1495
01:13:42,044 --> 01:13:43,170
Arthur!

1496
01:13:43,337 --> 01:13:44,379
What's wrong!

1497
01:13:44,546 --> 01:13:46,089
Maybe he's allergic to flowers.

1498
01:13:46,256 --> 01:13:48,537
Is that what she meant when
she said he'd know what to do?

1499
01:13:48,634 --> 01:13:51,261
- Oh Arthur.
- Oh, what happened?

1500
01:13:51,428 --> 01:13:52,554
You fainted.

1501
01:13:52,721 --> 01:13:54,640
I told you not to go
out in your condition.

1502
01:13:54,806 --> 01:13:55,891
How'd she get here?

1503
01:13:56,058 --> 01:13:57,535
That Galleo tried to
murder her then left her

1504
01:13:57,559 --> 01:13:58,977
for dead on our terrace.

1505
01:13:59,144 --> 01:13:59,895
Is that what she told you?

1506
01:14:00,062 --> 01:14:00,812
I mean, she's not dead is she?

1507
01:14:00,979 --> 01:14:02,189
Oh no, no, just unconscious.

1508
01:14:02,356 --> 01:14:03,482
We gave her some brandy

1509
01:14:03,649 --> 01:14:05,567
and I don't think the
poor dear's used to it.

1510
01:14:07,069 --> 01:14:08,671
I wish Galleo and his dog
would stop dropping things

1511
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:09,863
on our terrace.

1512
01:14:10,030 --> 01:14:10,781
Shouldn't
we call the police?

1513
01:14:10,948 --> 01:14:12,157
Police, for heaven's sake no.

1514
01:14:12,324 --> 01:14:13,408
Well why not?

1515
01:14:13,575 --> 01:14:15,335
Oh, well, I don't want
them to find her here.

1516
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:16,453
But why not?

1517
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,205
Well, they might
want to question her.

1518
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:19,665
Our consciences are clear.

1519
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:22,042
Yeah, but think
of the notoriety.

1520
01:14:22,209 --> 01:14:23,269
After all, I'm a business man,

1521
01:14:23,293 --> 01:14:24,878
a respected member of society.

1522
01:14:25,045 --> 01:14:27,231
And a mother with a daughter
of the American Revolution.

1523
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:28,465
This calls for action.

1524
01:14:29,967 --> 01:14:31,885
What are you gonna do with her?

1525
01:14:32,052 --> 01:14:33,132
Where are you going Arthur?

1526
01:14:33,261 --> 01:14:35,013
- To Galleo's.
- Oh no!

1527
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:37,808
He's a dangerous man, a
murderer, he might kill you both.

1528
01:14:37,975 --> 01:14:39,518
I'm not afraid.

1529
01:14:39,685 --> 01:14:41,812
My isn't he brave.

1530
01:14:41,979 --> 01:14:44,272
Yes, but I think we'd
better call the police.

1531
01:14:44,439 --> 01:14:46,233
We might really need them now.

1532
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,240
Oh, uh, let me,
where is the telephone?

1533
01:14:48,276 --> 01:14:49,276
In the bedroom.

1534
01:14:54,116 --> 01:14:55,659
What have you got there?

1535
01:14:55,826 --> 01:14:58,161
The body we buried last
night, it's come back.

1536
01:14:58,328 --> 01:15:00,330
But it's going to
haunt you, not me.

1537
01:15:00,497 --> 01:15:02,124
Oh, oh, what's that?

1538
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:03,709
Olive's twin
sister, it's a dummy.

1539
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:05,919
That's what we buried
in Westchester, pal.

1540
01:15:06,086 --> 01:15:07,295
Why you double crossing...

1541
01:15:07,462 --> 01:15:08,862
Uh uh, wait a
minute, just a minute.

1542
01:15:09,006 --> 01:15:10,298
Remember, you started all this.

1543
01:15:10,465 --> 01:15:13,093
From now on keep your
unconscious bodies off my terrace.

1544
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:15,053
I've got more to do
than clean up after you.

1545
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,638
Well, why did you dig her up?

1546
01:15:16,805 --> 01:15:20,058
Your lawyer dug her up and
he kept the trunk for evidence.

1547
01:15:20,225 --> 01:15:21,476
- Evidence?
- Mm-hm.

1548
01:15:21,643 --> 01:15:23,228
This wire came with the body.

1549
01:15:23,395 --> 01:15:26,314
It seems you're about to sue
me Earthleigh for blackmail,

1550
01:15:26,481 --> 01:15:28,066
defamation of character, fraud,

1551
01:15:28,233 --> 01:15:30,110
intimidation and trespassing.

1552
01:15:30,277 --> 01:15:32,195
I ought to punch
you in the nose.

1553
01:15:32,362 --> 01:15:33,655
I ought to punch you.

1554
01:15:33,822 --> 01:15:35,949
Leaving Olive on my terrace
for my wife to find.

1555
01:15:36,116 --> 01:15:37,116
Go ahead!

1556
01:15:38,493 --> 01:15:40,412
You owe me a
punch, I owe you one,

1557
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:42,080
let's considered
blows exchanged.

1558
01:15:42,247 --> 01:15:44,291
You have a black eye,
I have a bloody nose.

1559
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:46,001
Honor has been satisfied.

1560
01:15:46,168 --> 01:15:47,603
And Olive has a place
to sleep it off.

1561
01:15:47,627 --> 01:15:49,588
Oh no you don't,
I'm expecting Deborah,

1562
01:15:49,755 --> 01:15:51,190
I've had enough trouble
on account of Olive,

1563
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:51,965
get her out of here.

1564
01:15:52,132 --> 01:15:52,632
Where am I gonna take her?

1565
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:53,425
Back to my wife?

1566
01:15:53,592 --> 01:15:54,760
She'll call the police.

1567
01:15:54,926 --> 01:15:56,279
Can't you control
that wife of yours?

1568
01:15:56,303 --> 01:15:57,804
Oh, I don't know.

1569
01:15:57,971 --> 01:16:00,223
- I've never tried.
- I wish she was my wife.

1570
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:01,516
You know what I'd do?

1571
01:16:01,683 --> 01:16:03,060
No, but I wish
she was your wife.

1572
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:04,436
Well, that's your problem,

1573
01:16:04,603 --> 01:16:05,883
but don't try
leaving Olive here,

1574
01:16:05,937 --> 01:16:07,773
because the next time
I'll take her right back

1575
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:09,691
to Mae with a full explanation.

1576
01:16:09,858 --> 01:16:11,068
Now beat it.

1577
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:13,445
And take her with you, I've
got to finish dressing.

1578
01:16:59,407 --> 01:17:00,742
What happened?

1579
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:02,869
What happened next door?

1580
01:17:03,036 --> 01:17:05,122
Don't you worry about
what happened next door.

1581
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:07,415
That Galleo isn't gonna
bother us anymore.

1582
01:17:07,582 --> 01:17:09,000
I told him what I was gonna do

1583
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:10,937
if he dumped any more of his
old dead girlfriends over here.

1584
01:17:10,961 --> 01:17:12,712
- But we've called the police.
- We?

1585
01:17:12,879 --> 01:17:14,214
- I did.
- Police!

1586
01:17:14,381 --> 01:17:16,174
Why don't you two mind
your own business.

1587
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:17,652
If you two want to know
what's good for you,

1588
01:17:17,676 --> 01:17:18,510
you're gonna learn
to keep your nose

1589
01:17:18,677 --> 01:17:19,886
out of your neighbors affairs.

1590
01:17:20,053 --> 01:17:21,656
You can get into serious
trouble poking around

1591
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,389
where you're not wanted.

1592
01:17:22,556 --> 01:17:23,723
Now go home!

1593
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:24,890
And stay home!

1594
01:17:25,934 --> 01:17:27,954
- Arthur, what are...
- You get your hat and gloves!

1595
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:29,187
- What?
- You heard,

1596
01:17:29,354 --> 01:17:32,232
oh, I'm sorry dear,
I was carried away.

1597
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:33,775
Get your hat and gloves dear,

1598
01:17:33,942 --> 01:17:35,443
I was going to take
you out to dinner.

1599
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:37,195
That's a lovely idea.

1600
01:17:37,362 --> 01:17:38,572
What about the police?

1601
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:40,675
We called them because we
thought you were in danger.

1602
01:17:40,699 --> 01:17:42,635
Mae, didn't you think I
could take care of myself?

1603
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:45,245
What kind of a husband
do you think you've got?

1604
01:17:45,412 --> 01:17:47,164
I am beginning to wonder.

1605
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:48,330
Well, go get fixed up

1606
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,458
and I'll take you out to
a nice air cool place.

1607
01:18:06,433 --> 01:18:08,059
Hey, where have I
seen you before lady?

1608
01:18:08,226 --> 01:18:10,312
I remember, she
was the body in 10B.

1609
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:11,730
The artist model.

1610
01:18:11,897 --> 01:18:13,064
That's right.

1611
01:18:13,231 --> 01:18:15,066
Can't be you they've
murdered this time.

1612
01:18:15,233 --> 01:18:16,401
They found another body?

1613
01:18:16,568 --> 01:18:18,488
It's them old maids again,
this time it's in 10A.

1614
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:19,690
If this one's a false alarm,

1615
01:18:19,779 --> 01:18:22,157
we're gonna lock them
two old biddies up!

1616
01:18:24,868 --> 01:18:26,588
- Oh, too late.
- Now just a minute you two.

1617
01:18:26,703 --> 01:18:28,246
We've got some
questions to ask you.

1618
01:18:28,413 --> 01:18:29,456
What about?

1619
01:18:29,623 --> 01:18:31,166
Well it ain't
information Please?

1620
01:18:34,836 --> 01:18:36,713
Oh David, I'm...

1621
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,049
David, she's still here!

1622
01:18:39,216 --> 01:18:40,926
Oh, it's just a dummy
darling, remember?

1623
01:18:41,092 --> 01:18:42,427
Back from the grave to haunt us.

1624
01:18:45,972 --> 01:18:47,057
Olive!

1625
01:18:47,224 --> 01:18:48,350
Dummy!

1626
01:18:48,516 --> 01:18:49,351
Deborah, so help me,
Earthleigh left her.

1627
01:18:49,517 --> 01:18:50,685
Oh fine.

1628
01:18:50,852 --> 01:18:52,172
Deborah, you've
got to believe me.

1629
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:53,831
Make it a good story David,
take all the time you want.

1630
01:18:53,855 --> 01:18:54,606
Oh, what's the use.

1631
01:18:54,773 --> 01:18:55,857
Come on.

1632
01:18:56,024 --> 01:18:57,168
Help me bring her
to, she'll tell you.

1633
01:18:57,192 --> 01:18:58,294
Snap out of it, come on Olive.

1634
01:18:58,318 --> 01:18:59,318
Snap out of it.

1635
01:18:59,444 --> 01:19:00,904
We know nothing about a body.

1636
01:19:01,071 --> 01:19:03,114
We're shocked,
hurt and indignant.

1637
01:19:03,281 --> 01:19:05,041
Those old maids must
have been seeing things.

1638
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:07,035
Let's check their
story with the old maids.

1639
01:19:07,202 --> 01:19:08,411
Is that necessary?

1640
01:19:08,578 --> 01:19:10,389
Yes, it's necessary and
you can come along just

1641
01:19:10,413 --> 01:19:11,790
to see the job well done.

1642
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:23,134
It's no use, she's
really out this time.

1643
01:19:23,301 --> 01:19:25,053
Shouldn't we call a
doctor, her heart?

1644
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:27,055
Oh, she's got a heart
like a race horse.

1645
01:19:27,222 --> 01:19:29,224
There, she's coming to now.

1646
01:19:29,391 --> 01:19:31,685
Davy, darling, I'm back.

1647
01:19:31,851 --> 01:19:33,311
Was it all just a bad dream?

1648
01:19:33,478 --> 01:19:36,523
Olive, tell Deborah the
truth, tell her the truth now!

1649
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:38,608
I love him, you can't have him.

1650
01:19:38,775 --> 01:19:40,443
Oh, that's all, Mr. Galleo.

1651
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:41,778
Listen to me, Deborah.

1652
01:19:41,945 --> 01:19:43,071
I'll take you next door,

1653
01:19:43,238 --> 01:19:45,240
I'll prove this by
Earthleigh himself.

1654
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,926
She's out again, you'd
better look after her.

1655
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,201
I'm leaving.

1656
01:19:48,368 --> 01:19:49,637
Oh Deborah, stick with me,
you've got to believe me.

1657
01:19:49,661 --> 01:19:51,055
I'll show you what
I think of Olive.

1658
01:19:51,079 --> 01:19:53,331
I'll take her right
back where she belongs.

1659
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:59,212
I won't be a part
of this monstrous lie.

1660
01:19:59,379 --> 01:20:00,755
We both saw the body.

1661
01:20:00,922 --> 01:20:02,757
There was an attempted murder

1662
01:20:02,924 --> 01:20:04,884
and Mr. And Mrs.
Earthleigh knew it.

1663
01:20:05,051 --> 01:20:06,678
They saw her right
in their living room.

1664
01:20:06,845 --> 01:20:08,430
We saw no attempted murder.

1665
01:20:08,596 --> 01:20:10,265
We're shocked,
hurt and indignant.

1666
01:20:10,432 --> 01:20:11,742
These old ladies
keep seeing bodies

1667
01:20:11,766 --> 01:20:13,126
like black spots
before their eyes.

1668
01:20:13,226 --> 01:20:14,894
- Liver trouble.
- He's lying.

1669
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:16,688
All of us saw the body.

1670
01:20:16,855 --> 01:20:18,523
We saw it first
from our terrace.

1671
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:20,608
That's right, come
here and I'll show you.

1672
01:20:20,775 --> 01:20:23,153
I was in
here playing solitaire.

1673
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,196
I stepped out for a
breath of fresh air,

1674
01:20:25,363 --> 01:20:28,325
crossed over to the rail,
looked down, there it was.

1675
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,160
Oh!

1676
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:33,246
There it is again!

1677
01:20:34,956 --> 01:20:38,001
Now tell me you don't see that
Mr. Earthleigh, tell me that.

1678
01:20:38,168 --> 01:20:39,461
Uh, this is where I came in.

1679
01:20:42,964 --> 01:20:44,275
And that's exactly how
she came to be there,

1680
01:20:44,299 --> 01:20:45,550
you've got to believe me.

1681
01:20:45,717 --> 01:20:47,385
Look, Olive is Arthur
Earthleigh's girl,

1682
01:20:47,552 --> 01:20:49,179
she doesn't mean anything to me.

1683
01:20:50,513 --> 01:20:52,932
There he is, David Galleo,
arrest that man, Officer,

1684
01:20:53,099 --> 01:20:53,850
he's the murderer.

1685
01:20:54,017 --> 01:20:55,143
Murderer?

1686
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:56,102
He's the one my
husband's been shielding,

1687
01:20:56,269 --> 01:20:57,354
I don't know why.

1688
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,689
But I've kept quiet
long enough, arrest him.

1689
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:00,958
Better
come along, Galleo.

1690
01:21:00,982 --> 01:21:02,067
Oh, what for?

1691
01:21:02,233 --> 01:21:03,669
If you did what this
lady said you did,

1692
01:21:03,693 --> 01:21:05,945
we've got enough on you to
get your charcoal broiled.

1693
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:13,036
Will you kindly tell
me what the charges are?

1694
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:22,253
Oh you poor girl,
are you all right?

1695
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:24,297
Cheers everybody,
having a party?

1696
01:21:24,464 --> 01:21:27,425
Will somebody please
explain what's going on here?

1697
01:21:27,592 --> 01:21:29,844
I can explain the
whole thing with the help

1698
01:21:30,011 --> 01:21:32,097
of my friend and
neighbor, Mr. Earthleigh.

1699
01:21:32,263 --> 01:21:34,432
You leave Mr.
Earthleigh out of this.

1700
01:21:34,599 --> 01:21:37,352
How can I, Mr. Earthleigh
is very much in it.

1701
01:21:37,519 --> 01:21:38,978
Aren't you, Arthur.

1702
01:21:39,145 --> 01:21:40,998
If Arthur's done anything
wrong it's all your fault.

1703
01:21:41,022 --> 01:21:43,566
You and your dog and your women.

1704
01:21:43,733 --> 01:21:46,069
I suppose you're the new
favorite of his harem.

1705
01:21:46,236 --> 01:21:47,821
My dear Mrs. Earthleigh.

1706
01:21:47,987 --> 01:21:50,865
Why don't you climb down from
that stepladder respectability

1707
01:21:51,032 --> 01:21:52,534
and look at people at eye level.

1708
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,077
You might like them.

1709
01:21:54,244 --> 01:21:54,953
Really?

1710
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,204
Has it come to this.

1711
01:21:56,371 --> 01:21:57,851
When a decent married
woman must stand

1712
01:21:57,997 --> 01:21:59,165
in her own living room

1713
01:21:59,332 --> 01:22:01,835
and be insulted by a
woman of your type.

1714
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:03,169
Oh!

1715
01:22:03,336 --> 01:22:04,462
Arthur!

1716
01:22:04,629 --> 01:22:06,005
Arthur, she struck me!

1717
01:22:06,172 --> 01:22:07,507
- Well, I'm sorry.
- You're sorry!

1718
01:22:07,674 --> 01:22:08,954
I'm sorry I didn't do it myself.

1719
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:10,427
Arthur!

1720
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:11,428
Sit down, Mae.

1721
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:12,929
He's out of his mind.

1722
01:22:13,096 --> 01:22:14,096
I said sit down.

1723
01:22:14,139 --> 01:22:15,223
- What?
- Sit down!

1724
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:17,100
Oh Arthur,
what's come over you?

1725
01:22:17,267 --> 01:22:18,810
I don't know, but it feels good.

1726
01:22:18,977 --> 01:22:20,817
It started when I said
goodbye to you Saturday.

1727
01:22:20,937 --> 01:22:22,856
I've had a very exciting
Saturday and Sunday.

1728
01:22:23,022 --> 01:22:24,065
Hectic, but exciting.

1729
01:22:24,232 --> 01:22:25,608
Not a dull moment.

1730
01:22:25,775 --> 01:22:27,586
I drank and dined and
listened to low-down music

1731
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,112
with a very entertaining
young woman.

1732
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:30,738
She was crazy, but fun.

1733
01:22:30,905 --> 01:22:31,906
Oh, Arthur!

1734
01:22:32,073 --> 01:22:33,283
Don't interrupt me!

1735
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:35,219
It was only by accident that
she spent the night here

1736
01:22:35,243 --> 01:22:36,762
and she changed that
stuffy little guest room

1737
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:38,204
of yours all around.

1738
01:22:38,371 --> 01:22:39,371
And it looked fine.

1739
01:22:39,414 --> 01:22:40,414
But I put it back

1740
01:22:40,457 --> 01:22:41,767
because you wouldn't
have liked it that way.

1741
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:43,227
Well I'm gonna have the
whole place done over

1742
01:22:43,251 --> 01:22:45,295
by Olive and Patricia Interiors.

1743
01:22:45,462 --> 01:22:46,671
That's a splendid idea.

1744
01:22:46,838 --> 01:22:48,678
Yeah, and furthermore,
I'm going to have a dog.

1745
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:49,840
I like dogs.

1746
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:51,166
Rabelais' about to be a father

1747
01:22:51,217 --> 01:22:52,278
and I'm putting in
my bid right now

1748
01:22:52,302 --> 01:22:53,622
for the biggest
pup in the litter.

1749
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:54,846
It's yours.

1750
01:22:55,013 --> 01:22:57,474
And furthermore I've
never liked this thing!

1751
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:01,895
And there goes your pineapple!

1752
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,857
Officers, officers do
something, he's gone mad.

1753
01:23:06,024 --> 01:23:07,150
You bet I've gone mad.

1754
01:23:07,317 --> 01:23:08,151
I see a plea of
insanity coming up.

1755
01:23:08,318 --> 01:23:09,318
Of course I'm crazy,

1756
01:23:09,402 --> 01:23:10,796
crazy to put up with
this all these years.

1757
01:23:10,820 --> 01:23:12,197
Let me at that other pineapple.

1758
01:23:12,363 --> 01:23:13,591
Now look here Mister,
we didn't come here

1759
01:23:13,615 --> 01:23:15,408
to referee any family squabbles.

1760
01:23:15,575 --> 01:23:18,119
Just tell us, who was
murdered and by who.

1761
01:23:18,286 --> 01:23:20,038
No one was murdered by whom

1762
01:23:20,205 --> 01:23:21,485
and no one attempted any murder,

1763
01:23:21,623 --> 01:23:24,209
it was all a big joke,
a practical joke.

1764
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:25,375
Who are you?

1765
01:23:26,419 --> 01:23:30,173
Olive Jensen's the name,
Miss Olive Jensen to you.

1766
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:31,508
Olive Jensen?

1767
01:23:31,674 --> 01:23:32,818
You're the woman who's
been missing for five days.

1768
01:23:32,842 --> 01:23:34,385
Yes, and why
haven't you found me!

1769
01:23:34,552 --> 01:23:36,804
What kind of a police
department have we got?

1770
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:38,973
Why I might have
been lost forever.

1771
01:23:41,601 --> 01:23:42,435
They found him.

1772
01:23:42,602 --> 01:23:43,728
Found who, dear?

1773
01:23:43,895 --> 01:23:45,438
The Greenwich Village Murderer,

1774
01:23:45,605 --> 01:23:48,650
captured in a rooming
house on 96th Street.

1775
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:52,028
I always knew he
was from Uptown.

1776
01:23:52,195 --> 01:23:55,573
There they are now,
two minutes late.

1777
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:56,950
Who, dear?

1778
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:59,035
The Earthleighs.
Oh.

1779
01:24:00,245 --> 01:24:03,081
Mae, you forgot the sugar again.

1780
01:24:03,248 --> 01:24:04,248
Yes, dear.

1781
01:24:16,010 --> 01:24:17,010
Oh.

1782
01:24:28,231 --> 01:24:28,856
Good morning!

1783
01:24:29,023 --> 01:24:30,149
Good morning neighbor.

1784
01:24:31,109 --> 01:24:32,109
Good morning.

1785
01:24:33,736 --> 01:24:36,030
Oh David, you've
forgotten the cream again.

1786
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:38,198
Yes, dear.

1787
01:24:40,618 --> 01:24:43,246
Oh, he forgot the cream again.

1788
01:24:44,372 --> 01:24:46,291
He's so forgetful.
