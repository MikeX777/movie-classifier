1
00:00:45,472 --> 00:00:50,322
More ancient than the earliest
records of Chinese civilization...

2
00:00:51,123 --> 00:00:52,775
are legends.

3
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:03,667
Legends of great warriors,
of knights and wizards,

4
00:01:03,668 --> 00:01:05,103
and mysterious monks

5
00:01:05,104 --> 00:01:07,672
who could perform wondrous feats.

6
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:14,243
In these fabulous beings

7
00:01:14,244 --> 00:01:16,898
was embodied the essence
of good and evil.

8
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:20,467
They had the power to fly

9
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:23,688
and the strength to defeat whole armies.

10
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:37,875
These fables thrived
until about 100 years ago,

11
00:01:37,876 --> 00:01:40,618
and then a new legend was born.

12
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,191
According to the Chinese
astrological calendar,

13
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:19,411
1940 was the year of the dragon.

14
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:23,024
Bruce Lee was born on the
27th of November of that year.

15
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:25,287
The place was San Francisco.

16
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,463
His father, Lee Hoi-Chuen,

17
00:03:27,464 --> 00:03:29,813
was a leading comic actor in Hong Kong,

18
00:03:29,814 --> 00:03:32,686
and was appearing in a
touring Cantonese opera troupe,

19
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:34,470
something like the Chinese equivalent

20
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:36,211
of a vaudeville show.

21
00:03:36,212 --> 00:03:38,213
His wife, Grace, who was half-German,

22
00:03:38,214 --> 00:03:40,433
was accompanying him.

23
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:45,699
The tour over, the Lee family
returned to Hong Kong

24
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,657
when Bruce was 3 months old.

25
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:50,442
A family portrait
in their Nathan road flat

26
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:53,837
shows Bruce at the center.

27
00:03:53,838 --> 00:03:56,231
Bruce considered his first film role

28
00:03:56,232 --> 00:03:58,102
was in The Beginning of a Boy

29
00:03:58,103 --> 00:04:00,540
which he made when he was six.

30
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,846
Two years later, he played a leading role

31
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:05,109
inMy Son, Ah Chung.

32
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,242
Much of the material
written about Bruce Lee

33
00:04:07,243 --> 00:04:10,288
states that he never appeared
in films with his father.

34
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:13,291
These rare scenes from My Son, Ah Chung

35
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:15,119
prove the opposite.

36
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,599
Interestingly,

37
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,514
this was the first
of their films together

38
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:21,866
in which Bruce had a more
important role than his father.

39
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,744
The theme of this film was fairly typical

40
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:32,963
of many of the more than
20 he appeared in

41
00:04:32,964 --> 00:04:36,750
before returning
to San Francisco in 1958.

42
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:38,926
InAh Chung, Bruce Lee is an orphan,

43
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:42,800
whose only education is
what he can find on the street.

44
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:12,743
Hey, you little brat.
Put that down, you!

45
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:19,209
Uncle.

46
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:29,803
In what is almost a preview in miniature

47
00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:31,543
of a scene in Enter The Dragon,

48
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:33,415
Bruce picks up a broomstick and attacks.

49
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,677
Why did you hit me for?

50
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:35,679
Why did you steal?

51
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,289
It's not your business.

52
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:41,903
You're a thief.

53
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,822
I'll get you, you pig!

54
00:05:48,823 --> 00:05:50,475
Now then tell me the truth.

55
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,477
Where were you last night?

56
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,089
Are you scheming against me, eh?

57
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,960
You little devil, you!

58
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:59,615
Are you going to tell me
the truth, are you?

59
00:05:59,616 --> 00:06:01,791
Come along, speak up, I say.

60
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:04,359
Tell me the truth, you little devil.

61
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,013
You've been nothing but trouble

62
00:06:06,014 --> 00:06:07,579
ever since you came here.

63
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,494
I'll see that you'll get a good fighting.

64
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:10,758
Oh!

65
00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:21,159
You beat up my brother,
I'll chop off your head!

66
00:06:27,818 --> 00:06:30,342
You devil!

67
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:33,127
I'll kill you.

68
00:06:33,128 --> 00:06:34,519
How much of his own character

69
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,347
did Bruce bring to these roles?

70
00:06:36,348 --> 00:06:38,219
And how much were his screen characters

71
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,439
beginning to infuse
into his own personality?

72
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,441
As time went on, Bruce would play

73
00:06:43,442 --> 00:06:45,487
more and more of the kind of role

74
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,838
that could be described
as a problem youth.

75
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,971
Many of these reflected themes

76
00:06:50,972 --> 00:06:53,669
of films popular in the
United States at the time,

77
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,932
films like Blackboard Jungle.

78
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:59,502
One of Bruce's films is
called Boys on the Street.

79
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:04,549
If we watch him closely
in the many street brawls

80
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,508
with which these films abound,

81
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,031
we can already see the beginnings

82
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:10,773
of the trademarks
of expression and gesture

83
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:13,428
which he would later make
so very much his own.

84
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:15,169
Yes, I got a big mouth,

85
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,519
but I can back it up with my fist.

86
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,129
You want to pick a fight?

87
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,652
You said it, you asked for it.

88
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:21,698
Hey, stop it.

89
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:23,351
Paper Tiger, after all.

90
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:24,787
Stop it, will you?

91
00:07:24,788 --> 00:07:26,006
You kids shouldn't fight here.

92
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:28,487
This is my place, now get out of here.

93
00:07:31,447 --> 00:07:34,449
Coward, I dare you follow me.

94
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,451
Hey, he took my box.

95
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:36,651
Get him.
Come on.

96
00:07:40,717 --> 00:07:41,979
Hey, you!

97
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:16,013
These kids really have guts.

98
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:23,628
You want some more?

99
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:27,458
I took your shoeshine box to
get you your first square-off.

100
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:29,678
Now you know I mean business.

101
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:30,767
Come on, kids.

102
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:32,986
Come on, kids, let's go.

103
00:08:32,987 --> 00:08:36,337
Oh, come on, let's go.

104
00:08:36,338 --> 00:08:38,948
Snapshots from
the Lee family's photo album

105
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:41,951
show Bruce growing to be
a handsome young man,

106
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:44,562
with a normal interest in girls

107
00:08:44,563 --> 00:08:47,870
and motorbikes.

108
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,004
Although he was bright,
Bruce was not a good student,

109
00:08:51,005 --> 00:08:53,093
at least not in the scholastic sense.

110
00:08:53,094 --> 00:08:56,357
He was more interested
in learning martial arts.

111
00:08:56,358 --> 00:08:57,749
Bruce always maintained

112
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,708
that his first teacher was his father,

113
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:01,362
who was a devotee of the fighting forms

114
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:03,016
known as Tai Chi.

115
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:05,409
But his first real teacher was Yip Man,

116
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,413
a master of the Wing Chun style.

117
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:10,850
The roots of Wing Chun

118
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:13,026
reach back to the famed Shaolin Temple.

119
00:09:13,027 --> 00:09:16,246
As this demonstration from
the filmWarriors 2 shows,

120
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:19,423
it emphasizes lightness and quickness

121
00:09:19,424 --> 00:09:21,513
rather than power and strength.

122
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:26,369
Stretch out two fingers.

123
00:09:28,564 --> 00:09:31,088
You must try to catch it
when I let it go.

124
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,310
Pick it up.

125
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:38,182
Do you realize why you can't catch it?

126
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:42,490
Because when your eyes see it fall,

127
00:09:42,491 --> 00:09:45,623
your brain signals
your hand nerves to react,

128
00:09:45,624 --> 00:09:47,974
but there's a delay.

129
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:51,325
So we're aiming to minimize that delay.

130
00:09:51,326 --> 00:09:53,109
That's why Wing Chun concentrates

131
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,937
on touch and speed.

132
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:57,636
Practice, there's no other way.

133
00:09:59,987 --> 00:10:02,902
The wooden man
is a Wing Chun training aid

134
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:06,689
used to develop quickness
and flexibility in attack.

135
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:10,518
Your enemy will not stand still.

136
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,000
Your reactions must be
one step ahead of his.

137
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:15,392
Otherwise you're dead.

138
00:10:15,393 --> 00:10:17,133
Therefore, your fists have got to strike

139
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:18,353
with the speed of light.

140
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:25,099
Try again.

141
00:10:36,153 --> 00:10:38,372
But kung fu was not Bruce's only interest

142
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:39,808
outside movies at that time.

143
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:41,810
He was quite a snappy dancer,

144
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:45,683
and in 1958, won a Hong Kong
cha-cha champion.

145
00:10:45,684 --> 00:10:47,772
But somehow, even his achievements

146
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,818
on the dance floor led back to kung fu.

147
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:51,559
This is Siu Hon Sung,

148
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,822
another of Bruce Lee's kung fu teachers.

149
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:58,174
He explains how Bruce
negotiated a deal with him.

150
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:03,266
One day Bruce took me to a coffee shop.

151
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:07,401
He said, "You're a master
of your styles of gung fu,

152
00:11:07,402 --> 00:11:10,970
and I'm a pretty good cha-cha dancer.

153
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,710
Why don't we do a deal?

154
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:16,497
You teach me gung fu,
I'll teach you cha-cha."

155
00:11:16,498 --> 00:11:19,587
Now an average person
would take 3 to 4 weeks

156
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:22,459
to learn my basic moves,

157
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,463
but Bruce took only 3 nights
to master the moves.

158
00:11:26,464 --> 00:11:28,988
So much for my cha-cha lessons.

159
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:32,556
Bruce didn't even give me time
to learn the basic beat.

160
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:35,603
The Orphan was the second last film

161
00:11:35,604 --> 00:11:38,171
Bruce would make
before leaving for America.

162
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:39,955
In it, he played the most extreme

163
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:42,827
of his delinquent loner roles.

164
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:44,264
His final film in Hong Kong

165
00:11:44,265 --> 00:11:46,353
was a complete contrast of The Orphan,

166
00:11:46,354 --> 00:11:48,442
and to any role before or after.

167
00:11:48,443 --> 00:11:51,010
The Thunderstorm
is probably the only film

168
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,882
in which he doesn't have
one single fight scene.

169
00:11:53,883 --> 00:11:56,058
Although there are
confrontations in the film,

170
00:11:56,059 --> 00:11:58,147
all the emphasis in The Thunderstorm

171
00:11:58,148 --> 00:11:59,975
is on the character's refusal

172
00:11:59,976 --> 00:12:02,760
to be drawn to fight
under any provocation.

173
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:04,893
This reluctance, at least initially,

174
00:12:04,894 --> 00:12:06,895
was a character device
that would feature heavily

175
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:08,853
in all of Bruce's later films.

176
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,246
Mary.

177
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:13,032
Can I help you,
Mr. Chan?

178
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:16,122
Mary, mom knows you're leaving us.

179
00:12:16,123 --> 00:12:18,733
It's hard to find jobs these days.

180
00:12:18,734 --> 00:12:21,127
She wants me to give you $100.

181
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:23,216
Oh, thank her for me, please,

182
00:12:23,217 --> 00:12:25,087
but I just can't take her money.

183
00:12:25,088 --> 00:12:30,136
I'm really sorry about today.

184
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:31,659
My brother didn't mean it.

185
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,269
He's sorry.

186
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,663
I promise he won't do it again.

187
00:12:35,664 --> 00:12:38,013
That's what he told me to tell you.

188
00:12:38,014 --> 00:12:40,624
Don't apologize,
Mr. Chan.

189
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,627
Well, anyway, I'm not your maid anymore.

190
00:12:43,628 --> 00:12:46,674
Mary, I've never treated you like a maid.

191
00:12:46,675 --> 00:12:48,851
I'm your friend, Mary. Leave her alone!

192
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:58,468
Mr. Wong.

193
00:12:58,469 --> 00:12:59,904
Sorry about today.

194
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,602
Chan, just leave my sister alone.

195
00:13:01,603 --> 00:13:04,083
David, what's wrong with you?

196
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:07,260
Mr. Chan was merely
offering to help us out.

197
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:08,913
We're from a poor family.

198
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,394
My sister will marry
a simple working man.

199
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:13,396
Yes, cooking meals,

200
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:16,095
washing clothes, bearing children...

201
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:18,836
these are what she'll be doing.

202
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:20,577
Any thoughts of going to school

203
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:23,580
or marrying a very wealthy man

204
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:26,105
will just bring her disappointment.

205
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,976
That's only one way of looking at it.

206
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:30,239
I think... Chan, I'm warning you.

207
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,415
Warning? Yes.

208
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,723
If I see anyone from
your family seeing my sister

209
00:13:35,724 --> 00:13:39,248
or coming to my neighborhood,
I'm gonna kill him.

210
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:41,424
David!

211
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:42,730
Are you out of your mind?

212
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:45,602
Mr. Chan, I think
you better excuse us.

213
00:13:45,603 --> 00:13:48,127
All right.

214
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:53,001
Mr. Wong, I know
you dislike me very much.

215
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:56,701
However, I still want to be your friend.

216
00:13:58,616 --> 00:13:59,877
Let's shake hands.

217
00:13:59,878 --> 00:14:02,707
I don't follow foreign habits.

218
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:06,754
It is quite likely that
Bruce would've returned

219
00:14:06,755 --> 00:14:08,495
to San Francisco anyway,

220
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:10,758
as he needed to do so
by the time he was 18

221
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:13,021
to confirm his American citizenship,

222
00:14:13,022 --> 00:14:15,023
but the fact that things were hotting up

223
00:14:15,024 --> 00:14:18,331
in his constant confrontations
with rival street gangs

224
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:20,985
and that his mother had
to stand guarantor for him

225
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,639
to avoid police prosecution

226
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,989
probably hastened his departure.

227
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,168
Bruce Lee took the next
steamer to the city of his birth.

228
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,865
On the way, he made a little extra money

229
00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:33,434
giving dance lessons.

230
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:40,223
From San Francisco,
he moved quickly to Seattle.

231
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:58,762
A Chinese restaurant called Ruby Chows

232
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:00,286
provided him with accommodation

233
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:02,157
in return for work.

234
00:15:02,158 --> 00:15:06,205
He served in the restaurant
and lived in the attic.

235
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,817
Once established,
a dramatic change occurred.

236
00:15:09,818 --> 00:15:11,514
He enrolled in high school

237
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:15,736
and the school dropout
became a diligent student.

238
00:15:15,737 --> 00:15:17,955
He still practiced kung fu passionately,

239
00:15:17,956 --> 00:15:20,872
but not longer on other people.

240
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,667
Graduating from high school,

241
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:37,105
he went to university
to study philosophy.

242
00:15:37,106 --> 00:15:38,715
His art teacher still treasures

243
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:42,284
two of the drawings he did at the time.

244
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:43,851
Bruce was a good student.

245
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:47,289
And his work with me
was always very ambitious,

246
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:52,903
and I've no doubt that he was
the same in all his classes.

247
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:54,688
For the ambitious Bruce Lee,

248
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:57,343
it was not enough to be
a good martial artist.

249
00:15:57,344 --> 00:15:59,476
He had to be the best.

250
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,440
He taught kung fu

251
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:09,398
to a group of fellow students,

252
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,878
one of whom was a 19-year-old girl

253
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:12,794
called Linda Emery.

254
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:18,364
They were married
and moved into this small

255
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:20,888
but comfortable house.

256
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:23,020
The former bully and man about town

257
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:25,284
became the ideal husband and father

258
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,939
to Brandon and later Shannon.

259
00:16:39,473 --> 00:16:42,475
A kung fu demonstration
at Long Beach in 1964

260
00:16:42,476 --> 00:16:44,172
turned out to be one
of the most important events

261
00:16:44,173 --> 00:16:46,000
in Bruce Lee's life.

262
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:47,306
It was seen by an acquaintance

263
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:48,829
of a television producer

264
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,134
who was looking for someone to play

265
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,353
Charlie Chan's number one son

266
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:53,442
in a proposed series.

267
00:16:53,443 --> 00:16:54,748
A screen test of Bruce was arranged.

268
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:56,532
Tell us your name,

269
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:58,105
your age and where you were born.

270
00:16:59,493 --> 00:17:00,928
My last name is Lee.

271
00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:02,364
Bruce Lee.

272
00:17:02,365 --> 00:17:04,584
I was born in San Francisco in 1940.

273
00:17:04,585 --> 00:17:06,368
I'm 24 right now.

274
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:09,806
And you worked in movies
and pictures in Hong Kong?

275
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:12,331
Yes, since I was around 6 years old.

276
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,637
And when did you leave Hong Kong?

277
00:17:14,638 --> 00:17:16,813
1959, when I was 18.

278
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:18,206
I see.

279
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:20,208
Now look over to me, Bruce, as we talk.

280
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:23,646
I understand you
just had a baby boy.Yeah.

281
00:17:23,647 --> 00:17:25,561
And you've lost a little
sleep over it, have you?

282
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:27,215
Three nights.

283
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:29,086
And tell the crew what time

284
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,175
they shoot the pictures in Hong Kong.

285
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,221
Oh, it's mostly in the morning

286
00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:35,702
because it's kind of noisy in Hong Kong,

287
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:39,227
you know, around
three million people there.

288
00:17:39,228 --> 00:17:41,708
So every time when they have picture,

289
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:43,971
it's mostly, say around,

290
00:17:43,972 --> 00:17:46,843
12 a.m. to 5 a.m.
in the morning.

291
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:48,584
I see.

292
00:17:48,585 --> 00:17:50,847
Look directly into the camera, Bruce.

293
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:52,545
Directly at it.

294
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:54,547
And now give me a three-quarter this way.

295
00:17:54,548 --> 00:17:56,331
And hold it.

296
00:17:56,332 --> 00:17:58,464
And give me a profile
that way, all the way.

297
00:17:58,465 --> 00:18:00,204
Good, hold it.

298
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:03,382
Now come back to a profile
on the other side.

299
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:04,818
Now hold that.

300
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:07,864
Give me a three-quarter on that side.

301
00:18:07,865 --> 00:18:10,214
And then give me a right
into the camera again.

302
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,260
All right, now the camera will pull back.

303
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:14,480
And, Bruce,

304
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:16,830
first show me the movements

305
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:19,615
in the classical Chinese theater.

306
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:21,443
Classical Chinese theater?

307
00:18:21,444 --> 00:18:23,184
Well, you know, what we
talked about in the office.

308
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,751
How they walk and how they start to move.

309
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:26,970
Well, in a Chinese opera,

310
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:28,885
they have the warrior

311
00:18:28,886 --> 00:18:31,018
and then the scholar.

312
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:34,630
The way the warrior walk
will be something like this.

313
00:18:34,631 --> 00:18:38,765
Walking this way,
straight, come out, bend,

314
00:18:38,766 --> 00:18:41,158
straight and then walk out again.

315
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:42,291
An ordinary scholar,

316
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:44,901
will be just like a female,

317
00:18:44,902 --> 00:18:48,427
a weakling, 90 pounds...

318
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:51,778
He'll be just walking,
you know, like a girl, real...

319
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:53,214
shoulder up and everything.

320
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,563
So by the way they walk,

321
00:18:54,564 --> 00:18:55,956
you can immediately tell who they are.

322
00:18:55,957 --> 00:18:58,393
Right. What character
they represent.

323
00:18:58,394 --> 00:19:01,352
Now show us some gung fu movements.

324
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:02,963
Well, it's hard to show it alone,

325
00:19:02,964 --> 00:19:04,573
but I will try to do my best.

326
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:07,141
All right. Maybe one of
the fellows will walk in.

327
00:19:07,142 --> 00:19:08,403
Yeah, it would be...

328
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:09,536
Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.

329
00:19:09,537 --> 00:19:11,320
Come on, Lee, get in there!

330
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:17,500
Although accidents
do happen, but, you know...

331
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:20,415
There are various kinds of strikes.

332
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,809
It depends on where you hit

333
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,680
and what weapon you will be using.

334
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:27,683
To the eye, you would use fingers.

335
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:29,206
Don't worry, I won't.

336
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:32,296
To the eyes or straight at the face,

337
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:35,474
from the waist everything on.

338
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:37,084
Hold it, just a minute.

339
00:19:37,085 --> 00:19:38,694
Let's move this gentleman around this way

340
00:19:38,695 --> 00:19:40,522
so you're doing it more into the camera.

341
00:19:40,523 --> 00:19:41,742
Okay, swell.

342
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:47,050
And then there is bent-arm strike

343
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:49,357
using the waist again

344
00:19:49,358 --> 00:19:50,881
into a back fist.

345
00:19:52,709 --> 00:19:53,970
Let's have the assistant director

346
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:55,538
back up this way.

347
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,541
Okay, go ahead.
Continue.

348
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:02,065
And then, of course,
kung fu is very sneaky.

349
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:06,461
You know, the Chinese,
they always hit low,

350
00:20:06,462 --> 00:20:09,725
from high go back to the groin.

351
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:11,248
Now turn around the other
way, would you, Bruce?

352
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:13,468
Okay. Yeah.

353
00:20:13,469 --> 00:20:15,078
Would you want me to...

354
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,863
These are just natural reactions.

355
00:20:16,864 --> 00:20:19,082
Right, right. That is
a natural reaction.

356
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,215
Right into the camera. Cheat
into the camera a little bit.

357
00:20:21,216 --> 00:20:22,304
Show us again.

358
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:23,696
All right. Go ahead.

359
00:20:23,697 --> 00:20:27,264
There is a finger jab, there is a punch,

360
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:29,266
there is the back fist and then low.

361
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:31,138
Of course, then they use leg,

362
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:33,749
straight to the groin or come up

363
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,012
or if I can back up a little bit,

364
00:20:36,013 --> 00:20:39,581
they start back from here
and then come back.

365
00:20:39,582 --> 00:20:42,584
All right. He's kind of worried.

366
00:20:42,585 --> 00:20:44,630
For various reasons,

367
00:20:44,631 --> 00:20:46,370
the series was never produced,

368
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,155
but it did lead to the role of Kato

369
00:20:48,156 --> 00:20:50,287
in the series The Green Hornet.

370
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:51,854
While the show itself was not exactly

371
00:20:51,855 --> 00:20:53,900
an overwhelming success...

372
00:20:53,901 --> 00:20:56,555
it lasted 30 half-hour episodes...

373
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:58,252
Bruce received favorable reviews

374
00:20:58,253 --> 00:21:01,864
and was probably more
popular than the star.

375
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:03,518
He had a small part in Marlowe

376
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:05,215
with James Garner.

377
00:21:05,216 --> 00:21:08,305
And then came Longstreet.

378
00:21:08,306 --> 00:21:09,438
I'll be kicking you.
You ready?

379
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:12,136
Ready. One and two!

380
00:21:17,185 --> 00:21:20,318
You all right? That guy's fantastic!

381
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,277
Now what is this...

382
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:24,844
what is this thing you do?

383
00:21:24,845 --> 00:21:27,455
In Cantonese, Jeet Kune Do,

384
00:21:27,456 --> 00:21:29,239
the way of the intercepting fist.

385
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,024
Intercepting fist, huh?

386
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:32,547
Or foot.

387
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:34,942
Come on, touch me any way you can.

388
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:40,338
You see?

389
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:42,949
To reach me, you must move to me.

390
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,167
Your attack offers me

391
00:21:44,168 --> 00:21:46,430
an opportunity to intercept you.

392
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,998
In this case, I'm using
my longest weapon,

393
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:53,263
my side kick, against the
nearest target, your kneecap.

394
00:21:53,264 --> 00:21:56,179
This can be compared
to your left jab in boxing,

395
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,746
except it's much more damaging.

396
00:21:57,747 --> 00:21:59,487
I see.

397
00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:00,576
Well, speaking of a left jab...

398
00:22:00,577 --> 00:22:02,055
Oh.

399
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:05,928
This time I intercept
your emotional tenseness.

400
00:22:05,929 --> 00:22:08,452
By now, Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do classes

401
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:12,195
were so famous
he could charge $275 an hour,

402
00:22:12,196 --> 00:22:14,850
and even then he could pick
and choose his students,

403
00:22:14,851 --> 00:22:17,244
students like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,

404
00:22:17,245 --> 00:22:19,464
Steve McQueen and James Coburn.

405
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:28,647
However, Bruce Lee's overriding ambition

406
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:30,518
was Hollywood.

407
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:32,738
But Hollywood was not responding.

408
00:22:32,739 --> 00:22:34,740
The movie roles were not forthcoming,

409
00:22:34,741 --> 00:22:36,480
and it was a bitter disappointment

410
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:37,873
when he was passed up for the lead

411
00:22:37,874 --> 00:22:40,528
in the TV seriesKung Fu.

412
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:43,488
He returned once again to Hong Kong.

413
00:22:58,895 --> 00:23:01,157
Hong Kong, 1970.

414
00:23:01,158 --> 00:23:03,725
Apart from one brief visit in 1968,

415
00:23:03,726 --> 00:23:06,381
Bruce Lee had been away for 12 years.

416
00:23:10,907 --> 00:23:14,214
Arriving in Hong Kong,
he first approached

417
00:23:14,215 --> 00:23:16,782
what was then Hong Kong's
biggest movie studios.

418
00:23:16,783 --> 00:23:18,784
None of the studio bosses
seemed to recognize

419
00:23:18,785 --> 00:23:20,699
the potential in Bruce.

420
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,005
He was just another actor, they said.

421
00:23:23,006 --> 00:23:25,442
Who could tell?

422
00:23:25,443 --> 00:23:28,445
One who could, it seems,
was Raymond Chow,

423
00:23:28,446 --> 00:23:31,274
the head of a small new
studio, Golden Harvest.

424
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:33,494
Good morning. Good morning.

425
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,889
The director says
it's his best work so far.

426
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,412
Well, I've seen it once

427
00:23:38,413 --> 00:23:39,935
and I think it's absolutely terrific.

428
00:23:39,936 --> 00:23:41,633
All right, let's roll, then.

429
00:23:45,376 --> 00:23:48,944
Raymond Chow was first
and foremost a filmmaker.

430
00:23:48,945 --> 00:23:50,598
Although now the corporate head

431
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,731
of his new Golden Harvest studio,

432
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:54,080
his production background

433
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:55,864
led him to constant contact

434
00:23:55,865 --> 00:23:57,737
with producers, directors and writers.

435
00:24:51,486 --> 00:24:53,530
On the busy Hong Kong grapevine,

436
00:24:53,531 --> 00:24:55,968
Chow had heard
of Shaw's unsuccessful offer

437
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:57,970
and made sure he saw
a demonstration Bruce gave

438
00:24:57,971 --> 00:24:59,623
on a local TV station

439
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:01,583
before returning
to the U.S.

440
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,629
The demonstration Bruce gave

441
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,415
on the TV show was very impressive.

442
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:09,764
He side kicked

443
00:25:09,765 --> 00:25:12,549
five 1-inch pots and broke four.

444
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,900
In addition, he kicked

445
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:17,511
and broke a 1-inch pot dangling.

446
00:25:17,512 --> 00:25:20,993
Now that takes tremendous
amount of strength

447
00:25:20,994 --> 00:25:22,429
and perfect timing.

448
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,648
But what impressed me more

449
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,172
was when I talked to him

450
00:25:26,173 --> 00:25:28,609
on a long distance call.

451
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,132
He picked the most popular

452
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:33,179
Hong Kong-made
action picture at that time

453
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,052
and asked a very blunt question.

454
00:25:37,053 --> 00:25:40,012
He asked me whether
that was the best we could do.

455
00:25:40,013 --> 00:25:41,883
I had to say yes.

456
00:25:41,884 --> 00:25:44,059
He then assured me

457
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,061
with sincerity and confidence

458
00:25:46,062 --> 00:25:48,847
that he could do much better.

459
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:51,501
How could I doubt this man?

460
00:25:51,502 --> 00:25:53,329
Raymond Chow offered Bruce Lee

461
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,636
a two-picture deal with Golden Harvest.

462
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,594
Bruce signed and flew to Thailand

463
00:25:57,595 --> 00:25:59,859
to start work on The Big Boss.

464
00:26:06,474 --> 00:26:08,997
The Big Boss, released asFists of Fury

465
00:26:08,998 --> 00:26:10,433
in the U.S.A.,

466
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:11,913
was made on a modest budget

467
00:26:11,914 --> 00:26:13,480
under fairly appalling conditions

468
00:26:13,481 --> 00:26:16,309
in the small village
of Pak Chong in Thailand.

469
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:20,922
For the first time,
Bruce Lee was in his element.

470
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:22,576
Here was not the aesthetic philosophizing

471
00:26:22,577 --> 00:26:24,360
of Long street.

472
00:26:24,361 --> 00:26:26,623
Here were not the quick
economical knock-downs

473
00:26:26,624 --> 00:26:28,321
of The Green Hornet.

474
00:26:28,322 --> 00:26:30,497
And most certainly,
here was not the hard,

475
00:26:30,498 --> 00:26:32,194
sharp economy of movement

476
00:26:32,195 --> 00:26:34,338
that Bruce Lee had been
teaching his students.

477
00:26:36,243 --> 00:26:39,767
Here suddenly was a whole new style

478
00:26:39,768 --> 00:26:42,117
of martial arts choreography.

479
00:26:42,118 --> 00:26:45,468
Rich, red-blooded, extravagant,

480
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:47,602
and bursting with power and energy.

481
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:57,917
And the public loved it!

482
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:05,010
In Hong Kong, it broke

483
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:06,708
all previous box office records.

484
00:27:08,101 --> 00:27:10,973
Bruce Lee was a star.

485
00:27:28,686 --> 00:27:30,992
Bruce Lee is incredible.

486
00:27:30,993 --> 00:27:32,994
Well, Bruce Lee didn't
like to waste any time.

487
00:27:32,995 --> 00:27:34,430
He wouldn't beat about the bush.

488
00:27:34,431 --> 00:27:35,779
He got very direct.

489
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,172
Is Bruce Lee your hero?

490
00:27:37,173 --> 00:27:38,521
Yes.

491
00:27:38,522 --> 00:27:41,742
Tell me what you like about him.

492
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,309
He always wins the bad guys

493
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:45,224
and he is a very quick mover.

494
00:27:45,225 --> 00:27:46,442
A question of body movement,

495
00:27:46,443 --> 00:27:48,749
the choreography, the timing...

496
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,185
in fact, the overcoming

497
00:27:50,186 --> 00:27:52,448
of the limitations of the human body.

498
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:53,710
I mean, he's not an action man

499
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:55,538
like Eastwood or Bronson.

500
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:57,540
I suppose he's more like a Nureyev.

501
00:27:57,541 --> 00:27:59,716
Both Bruce Lee and Raymond Chow

502
00:27:59,717 --> 00:28:01,675
were delighted with the
success of The Big Boss

503
00:28:01,676 --> 00:28:05,026
and set about finalizing
plans for the next film.

504
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:07,637
WithThe Big Boss a huge success,

505
00:28:07,638 --> 00:28:09,378
Raymond Chow allocated a larger budget

506
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:10,901
to the next film

507
00:28:10,902 --> 00:28:12,555
and agreed that Bruce would play

508
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:14,167
a larger role in producing it.

509
00:28:22,305 --> 00:28:23,740
In the meantime,

510
00:28:23,741 --> 00:28:25,612
Linda and the family moved to Hong Kong

511
00:28:25,613 --> 00:28:27,657
and set up house
in suburban Kowloon Tong.

512
00:28:27,658 --> 00:28:29,746
This 11-room, 2-story villa

513
00:28:29,747 --> 00:28:31,748
with its small Japanese-style garden

514
00:28:31,749 --> 00:28:33,533
may not have turned heads in Hollywood,

515
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:35,013
but for crowded Hong Kong,

516
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:37,232
it was nothing short of a palace.

517
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:40,410
There was room for the family
and friends to relax.

518
00:28:56,078 --> 00:28:58,340
Bruce divided his time at home

519
00:28:58,341 --> 00:29:00,212
between his study

520
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:02,649
and his exercise equipment,

521
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,079
which seemed to be everywhere.

522
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:14,617
The second film was called
The Chinese Connection

523
00:29:14,618 --> 00:29:17,055
in America, but was released in Hong Kong

524
00:29:17,056 --> 00:29:19,927
and elsewhere asFist Of Fury.

525
00:29:19,928 --> 00:29:21,798
This film took the cinematic expression

526
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:25,020
of rage and pure
destructive fury to new limits.

527
00:30:08,411 --> 00:30:11,587
It also put weapons in the hands
of Bruce Lee for the first time

528
00:30:11,588 --> 00:30:14,155
in the form of the deadly nunchakus,

529
00:30:14,156 --> 00:30:17,028
two sticks joined by a thong or chain.

530
00:30:59,288 --> 00:31:01,202
Not surprisingly,

531
00:31:01,203 --> 00:31:04,379
Fist Of Fury again
smashed box office records,

532
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,687
including the one Bruce Lee
had so recently set.

533
00:31:07,688 --> 00:31:09,036
Bruce was soon at work again

534
00:31:09,037 --> 00:31:10,994
developing ideas for his next film.

535
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:13,997
He went location hunting all over Italy

536
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:17,044
and finally, he decided on Rome.

537
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:18,263
He brought over Bob Wall,

538
00:31:18,264 --> 00:31:20,178
a top U.S. martial artist

539
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:21,744
and established champion

540
00:31:21,745 --> 00:31:23,050
who would make a formidable opponent

541
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:25,314
in his new film Way of the Dragon.

542
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,194
From Korea, he added Tae Kwon Do expert

543
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:37,805
Hwang In-Shik.

544
00:31:45,552 --> 00:31:47,422
As well as being the star,

545
00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:48,902
Bruce Lee wrote and directed

546
00:31:48,903 --> 00:31:50,383
Way of The Dragon.

547
00:33:22,213 --> 00:33:24,824
The result is another sell-out success

548
00:33:24,825 --> 00:33:27,000
to the extent that in Hong Kong

549
00:33:27,001 --> 00:33:29,394
the showing of the film had to
be suspended at some theaters

550
00:33:29,395 --> 00:33:31,352
while the police worked out ways

551
00:33:31,353 --> 00:33:34,008
to handle the traffic jams
and massive crowds.

552
00:33:38,012 --> 00:33:41,188
Nora Miao, a dynamic
young Hong Kong actress

553
00:33:41,189 --> 00:33:44,800
co-stared with Bruce in all
but the last of Bruce's films.

554
00:33:44,801 --> 00:33:46,889
Here she discusses the recurring themes

555
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,804
of Bruce Lee's films.

556
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:50,937
When did you first start to know him?

557
00:33:50,938 --> 00:33:54,941
Um, our families have known each other

558
00:33:54,942 --> 00:33:57,683
ever since I was a little kid.

559
00:33:57,684 --> 00:34:01,077
But then at that time,
Bruce went to the States

560
00:34:01,078 --> 00:34:03,036
and he was very young, too.

561
00:34:03,037 --> 00:34:04,820
So I didn't get to meet him

562
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:07,170
until he came back to Hong Kong

563
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:09,912
for his first movies for Golden Harvest.

564
00:34:09,913 --> 00:34:12,437
But surprisingly I didn't
meet him in Hong Kong.

565
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:14,090
Really, where did you meet him?

566
00:34:14,091 --> 00:34:16,179
I actually met him in Thailand,

567
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,225
where we were filming The Big Boss.

568
00:34:18,226 --> 00:34:20,096
I see, talking about his movies,

569
00:34:20,097 --> 00:34:22,055
a lot of people observe that

570
00:34:22,056 --> 00:34:24,362
there are a lot of
autobiographical elements

571
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:25,972
in Bruce Lee's movies.

572
00:34:25,973 --> 00:34:29,236
Did you experience
or did you find any incidents

573
00:34:29,237 --> 00:34:33,066
that he tried to relate his
experience through his movies?

574
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:34,720
Did you find any?

575
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:35,809
In a way, yes.

576
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:38,245
He always related his films

577
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:40,987
to his growing up in foreign country.

578
00:34:40,988 --> 00:34:43,859
And he likes to play the part of a man

579
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,601
arriving in a strange land.

580
00:34:46,602 --> 00:34:49,735
InThe Big Boss,
he was alone in a new town

581
00:34:49,736 --> 00:34:52,564
trying to succeed in a new job.

582
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:55,436
Even the country, Thailand, is strange.

583
00:34:55,437 --> 00:34:59,397
He has no friends and does
not know his potential enemies.

584
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:01,007
Now this is a good town

585
00:35:01,008 --> 00:35:03,139
and it's very different to back home.

586
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,404
So be careful,
don't get into fights, Chang.

587
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:07,883
Remember your promise.

588
00:35:07,884 --> 00:35:10,233
You're on your own from now on.

589
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:12,453
Don't worry, uncle.

590
00:35:12,454 --> 00:35:15,717
InFist of Fury he was
a student returning home

591
00:35:15,718 --> 00:35:17,632
to find everything had changed.

592
00:35:17,633 --> 00:35:20,418
His teacher murdered
and his school and race

593
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:22,986
insulted by a foreign-led rival school.

594
00:35:43,746 --> 00:35:46,444
InWay of the Dragon,
Bruce is a country boy

595
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:48,663
from a Hong Kong village who goes to Rome

596
00:35:48,664 --> 00:35:50,710
to help in a Chinese restaurant.

597
00:36:07,509 --> 00:36:09,554
The isolation of Bruce's character

598
00:36:09,555 --> 00:36:12,295
is further underlined
by the barrier of language.

599
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:15,342
Here, he can't make himself
understood enough

600
00:36:15,343 --> 00:36:16,866
to get something to eat.

601
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:20,695
Mommy!

602
00:36:20,696 --> 00:36:23,219
Bruce went to the States
when he was very young.

603
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,352
And from what Bruce told me,

604
00:36:25,353 --> 00:36:28,486
he felt that, being a foreigner,

605
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:32,490
he had to do his best in whatever he did.

606
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:35,580
And also, perhaps,

607
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:39,671
he was such a good
martial artist, you know.

608
00:36:39,672 --> 00:36:45,198
In times, people
tend to pick fights with him.

609
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:47,853
InThe Big Boss, the pendant Bruce wears

610
00:36:47,854 --> 00:36:52,335
is a reminder of a promise
he has made to avoid violence.

611
00:36:52,336 --> 00:36:55,382
In his films, Bruce never went
looking for a fight.

612
00:36:55,383 --> 00:36:57,210
Well, not initially, anyway.

613
00:36:57,211 --> 00:36:59,778
Invariably, his character would resist

614
00:36:59,779 --> 00:37:01,431
intolerable provocation

615
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:03,738
before violence
was virtually forced on him.

616
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:05,392
Yeah, we're very thirsty, sweetheart.

617
00:37:05,393 --> 00:37:07,350
We need to cool off, come on.

618
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:09,004
Leave me alone, you're hurting me.

619
00:37:09,005 --> 00:37:11,616
Come on, we'd like
to have a little bit of fun.

620
00:37:11,617 --> 00:37:13,879
Don't meddle, no fighting.

621
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,533
Remember your promise.

622
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:16,751
If you don't leave me alone,

623
00:37:16,752 --> 00:37:19,493
I'm going to call the police.

624
00:37:19,494 --> 00:37:22,235
Please.

625
00:37:22,236 --> 00:37:26,021
Then only when he was pushed
beyond his ability to resist

626
00:37:26,022 --> 00:37:28,372
did he become the attacker,
the aggressor.

627
00:37:38,557 --> 00:37:39,948
All right.

628
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:41,907
Hold it.

629
00:37:41,908 --> 00:37:45,128
Now you get out of here, I'm warning you.

630
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:49,305
You bastards can't push us around.

631
00:37:49,306 --> 00:37:52,047
You want to fight?

632
00:37:52,048 --> 00:37:54,268
I'll take you on.

633
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,927
Personally I think
Bruce was a great actor,

634
00:38:01,928 --> 00:38:06,279
a very good director
and a very good filmmaker.

635
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,325
And his main ambition in life

636
00:38:09,326 --> 00:38:12,633
is to introduce Chinese kung fu

637
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:15,680
and Chinese movies to the whole world.

638
00:38:15,681 --> 00:38:20,206
And he wanted to show that the Chinese

639
00:38:20,207 --> 00:38:22,512
could be just as good as anybody else.

640
00:38:22,513 --> 00:38:24,427
In all of Bruce's films,

641
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:27,169
the enemy were always
foreigners, non-Chinese.

642
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,606
Even when he was pounding

643
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:29,998
the life out of his compatriots,

644
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:31,696
it was made abundantly clear

645
00:38:31,697 --> 00:38:35,134
that they were misguided
pawns of a foreign boss.

646
00:38:35,135 --> 00:38:36,744
InThe Big Boss,

647
00:38:36,745 --> 00:38:39,573
he works in an ice factory run by Thais.

648
00:38:39,574 --> 00:38:41,619
The Thai foreman and his gang

649
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:44,971
bully the Chinese workers into servility.

650
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:03,642
Get to work!
Inside!

651
00:39:04,991 --> 00:39:06,556
To hell with you, man!
You lousy pig!

652
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:07,993
Bastard.

653
00:39:07,994 --> 00:39:09,908
It took the brutal and bloody murder

654
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:12,671
of his Chinese fellow workers
to push Bruce over the edge.

655
00:39:46,728 --> 00:39:49,425
In Fist of Fury, the Japanese
are the enemy.

656
00:39:49,426 --> 00:39:52,559
Delivers an insulting
message to Bruce's school.

657
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,517
The characters read,

658
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:56,956
"The Chinese are the Sick Man of Asia."

659
00:40:00,568 --> 00:40:02,264
Well, clear a space there.

660
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:04,919
My friends here promise
to put up a good fight.

661
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:09,185
Must be someone.
Who's your champion, huh?

662
00:40:12,928 --> 00:40:17,062
Mm, so many here and not
one of you with any courage.

663
00:40:17,063 --> 00:40:19,151
What's the matter with the lot of you?

664
00:40:19,152 --> 00:40:22,068
You afraid of us, huh?

665
00:40:31,904 --> 00:40:34,949
Later in the film, a sign
on a park gate is an insult

666
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,734
that cannot be ignored.

667
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:38,736
Hey, you.
What do you want?

668
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:40,041
I will pass.

669
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:42,001
No, no, not allowed, I'm afraid.

670
00:40:55,449 --> 00:40:56,798
And that?

671
00:40:58,104 --> 00:41:00,322
You're the wrong color, so beat.

672
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:02,935
Hey, you, come here.

673
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:14,989
You... you were wanting to get in here?

674
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:17,862
No, no, no, no.
Tell you what.

675
00:41:17,863 --> 00:41:19,951
There's only one thing you need to do.

676
00:41:19,952 --> 00:41:22,389
Pretend you're a dog
and I'll take you in.

677
00:41:50,025 --> 00:41:53,158
InWay Of The Dragon,
which takes place in Rome,

678
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:55,290
the underworld is trying to extort money

679
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:57,902
from the Chinese restaurant
where Bruce is working.

680
00:41:57,903 --> 00:42:00,426
Almost every day, Italian thugs

681
00:42:00,427 --> 00:42:02,994
go to the restaurant
to harass the Chinese,

682
00:42:02,995 --> 00:42:06,649
forcing them to agree
to the payments they demand.

683
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,564
May I help you?

684
00:42:08,565 --> 00:42:11,306
May you help me?

685
00:42:11,307 --> 00:42:12,526
Sure.

686
00:42:18,314 --> 00:42:21,534
Invariably, these foreigners'
assaults on Bruce

687
00:42:21,535 --> 00:42:23,188
and those who he championed

688
00:42:23,189 --> 00:42:25,190
were not just personal or physical,

689
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:26,887
but strongly racial,

690
00:42:26,888 --> 00:42:28,584
leaving Bruce no other alternative

691
00:42:28,585 --> 00:42:30,325
but to demonstrate the effectiveness

692
00:42:30,326 --> 00:42:32,285
of Chinese martial arts.

693
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:47,039
Movement number four, dragon seeks path.

694
00:42:49,345 --> 00:42:51,304
Dragon whips his tail.

695
00:43:35,522 --> 00:43:38,132
Bruce's screen personality as a hero

696
00:43:38,133 --> 00:43:40,134
was undeniable and unshakable.

697
00:43:40,135 --> 00:43:43,485
How much of that personality
has been transferred

698
00:43:43,486 --> 00:43:47,228
or injected into his real life?

699
00:43:47,229 --> 00:43:48,664
I would say without a doubt,

700
00:43:48,665 --> 00:43:50,666
the screen image of Bruce

701
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:54,279
was very much like
the Bruce in real life.

702
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,673
He was so energetic that even
when he was among friends,

703
00:43:57,674 --> 00:44:00,982
his gestures were very physical.

704
00:44:04,638 --> 00:44:09,294
And even when he was relaxing,
he looked very restless.

705
00:44:09,295 --> 00:44:11,557
Left, right, left, right, left.

706
00:44:11,558 --> 00:44:13,994
One, two, left, right.

707
00:44:13,995 --> 00:44:16,170
Hup two, three, four.

708
00:44:16,171 --> 00:44:17,432
Left, right, left...

709
00:44:17,433 --> 00:44:20,435
Hey, what's going on there?

710
00:44:20,436 --> 00:44:22,307
Hup two, three, four.

711
00:44:22,308 --> 00:44:24,570
One, two, three, four.

712
00:44:24,571 --> 00:44:28,574
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

713
00:44:28,575 --> 00:44:30,315
Hup two, three, four.

714
00:44:30,316 --> 00:44:32,578
A-one, two, three, four.

715
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:36,582
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right.

716
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:39,759
One, two, three, four.

717
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,848
Bruce didn't drink,

718
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:45,070
so the parts he played didn't
know how to drink either.

719
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:53,121
Well, Chang, how about a little drink?

720
00:45:02,696 --> 00:45:04,305
You're quite a drinker.

721
00:45:04,306 --> 00:45:05,960
You put it away like water.

722
00:45:31,116 --> 00:45:33,422
That will make you feel better.

723
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:11,938
In his movies,
his relationship with women

724
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:14,027
is usually shy and awkward,

725
00:46:14,028 --> 00:46:16,377
often coy and invariably wholesome.

726
00:46:16,378 --> 00:46:18,162
Mai, you've grown very pretty.

727
00:46:18,163 --> 00:46:20,947
Well, if I was 10 years younger, I'd...

728
00:46:20,948 --> 00:46:23,255
Chang, meet our younger sister, Chow Mai.

729
00:46:25,779 --> 00:46:27,823
This is Chang, our cousin.

730
00:46:27,824 --> 00:46:29,652
How are you?
It's hot.

731
00:46:55,809 --> 00:46:57,724
Chang.
Let me go.

732
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:25,359
I must go.

733
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,970
I'll see you later.

734
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,123
While there are occasional
hints of romantic feelings,

735
00:47:50,124 --> 00:47:52,604
Bruce's leading ladies
are usually treated more like

736
00:47:52,605 --> 00:47:53,997
one of the boys.

737
00:47:55,782 --> 00:47:58,218
Overt sexuality is only alluded to

738
00:47:58,219 --> 00:48:00,873
when the encounter is with a prostitute,

739
00:48:00,874 --> 00:48:03,354
and then only when
Bruce's lack of sophistication

740
00:48:03,355 --> 00:48:04,790
allows it to happen.

741
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:08,010
The foreigners here are quite friendly.

742
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:09,621
You'll see.

743
00:48:09,622 --> 00:48:11,797
When people smile, you smile back.

744
00:48:11,798 --> 00:48:12,998
It's only right.

745
00:48:16,672 --> 00:48:20,633
While you're here,
just don't be so uptight.

746
00:48:42,437 --> 00:48:44,873
In the only bedroom scene
Bruce ever filmed,

747
00:48:44,874 --> 00:48:47,528
a prostitute first gets him drunk,

748
00:48:47,529 --> 00:48:49,749
and even then he goes to sleep.

749
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:58,496
In his films, Bruce Lee
was at his best as a fighter

750
00:48:58,497 --> 00:49:00,324
rather than a lover.

751
00:49:00,325 --> 00:49:02,326
But he was very concerned
that he would be typecast

752
00:49:02,327 --> 00:49:05,024
as a one-character performer.

753
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,852
InFist of Fury, he used the device

754
00:49:06,853 --> 00:49:08,332
of disguising himself,

755
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:09,855
perhaps with the object

756
00:49:09,856 --> 00:49:12,423
of demonstrating his dramatic range,

757
00:49:12,424 --> 00:49:14,207
here as a news vendor.

758
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:15,513
You see what they're doing?

759
00:49:15,514 --> 00:49:17,036
Forcing my hand.

760
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,994
But where can I find him in this place?

761
00:49:18,995 --> 00:49:22,346
Sir, why not try

762
00:49:22,347 --> 00:49:24,086
to get back to Jingwu school,

763
00:49:24,087 --> 00:49:25,828
see if he's turned up there, huh?

764
00:49:37,362 --> 00:49:40,408
Here as a telephone repairman.

765
00:50:02,038 --> 00:50:03,387
Good afternoon there.

766
00:50:03,388 --> 00:50:04,866
I'm from the telephone company.

767
00:50:04,867 --> 00:50:06,172
Oh.

768
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:07,652
What on earth took you so long?

769
00:50:07,653 --> 00:50:09,218
We haven't got all day, you know.

770
00:50:09,219 --> 00:50:12,744
Just got my orders minutes ago.

771
00:50:12,745 --> 00:50:14,963
These vignettes were more
comedic than convincing.

772
00:50:14,964 --> 00:50:16,443
But later around the time

773
00:50:16,444 --> 00:50:18,271
he was working on Game Of Death,

774
00:50:18,272 --> 00:50:19,707
he was experimenting with a whole range

775
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:21,144
of new characters.

776
00:50:42,949 --> 00:50:47,256
He makes a very believable
blind swordsman,

777
00:50:47,257 --> 00:50:50,259
his version of a character
called Zatoichi,

778
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,739
who appeared in several Japanese films

779
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,525
popular in Asia at the time.

780
00:50:58,443 --> 00:50:59,643
Tagashira!

781
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,991
Surprisingly, these characters

782
00:51:25,992 --> 00:51:28,820
were all developed
from classical archetypes,

783
00:51:28,821 --> 00:51:31,736
and most were associated
with traditional weaponry,

784
00:51:31,737 --> 00:51:33,607
contrary to his declared philosophy

785
00:51:33,608 --> 00:51:34,914
of the martial arts.

786
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,012
It is not possible to say

787
00:51:47,013 --> 00:51:49,710
how he would've developed
these characters,

788
00:51:49,711 --> 00:51:51,495
but it is interesting to conjecture

789
00:51:51,496 --> 00:51:53,279
what Bruce Lee would have made of roles

790
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,412
like the classic period Chinese swordsman

791
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:57,458
in films like Duel to the Death.

792
00:52:30,883 --> 00:52:33,450
For some time, actor James Coburn,

793
00:52:33,451 --> 00:52:35,060
writer Stirling Silliphant

794
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:37,323
and Bruce had been trying to put together

795
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:40,413
a project to be called Silent Flute.

796
00:52:40,414 --> 00:52:42,807
Finally, 20th Century-Fox
agreed to do it,

797
00:52:42,808 --> 00:52:44,896
but on a tiny budget

798
00:52:44,897 --> 00:52:47,638
and providing it could be shot in India.

799
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:49,509
Bruce and his colleagues spent weeks

800
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:52,077
location hunting there and in Nepal.

801
00:52:52,078 --> 00:52:54,688
India, they decided, was a waste of time,

802
00:52:54,689 --> 00:52:56,821
but it was in Nepal
that pagodas like these

803
00:52:56,822 --> 00:52:59,824
gave Bruce an inspiration
for Game of Death.

804
00:52:59,825 --> 00:53:01,956
Bruce never crystallized the plot,

805
00:53:01,957 --> 00:53:04,045
but it went something like this:

806
00:53:04,046 --> 00:53:06,570
there would be a great
martial arts training center

807
00:53:06,571 --> 00:53:08,528
based in a many-storied pagoda.

808
00:53:08,529 --> 00:53:10,661
Each level would be guarded by a master

809
00:53:10,662 --> 00:53:13,272
of a different martial art.

810
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,841
Bruce began to accumulate
the people he wanted to use.

811
00:53:16,842 --> 00:53:18,042
Dan Inosanto...

812
00:53:30,377 --> 00:53:32,596
The Korean seventh-degree Hapkido master

813
00:53:32,597 --> 00:53:33,902
Ji Han Jae.

814
00:53:50,005 --> 00:53:51,876
He began doing screen tests.

815
00:53:51,877 --> 00:53:54,269
This footage of the tests and outtakes

816
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,185
has never been publicly shown before.

817
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:13,506
In his still-incomplete
concept for Game Of Death,

818
00:54:13,507 --> 00:54:15,726
his ultimate objective would be to get to

819
00:54:15,727 --> 00:54:17,537
whatever was at the top of the pagoda.

820
00:55:57,263 --> 00:55:59,525
In the middle of this,
producer Fred Weintraub

821
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:01,309
had finally convinced Warner Bros.

822
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:02,876
To co-produce a project

823
00:56:02,877 --> 00:56:04,312
with the partnership of Raymond Chow

824
00:56:04,313 --> 00:56:06,140
and Bruce Lee.

825
00:56:06,141 --> 00:56:08,448
This was to be Enter The Dragon.

826
00:56:14,019 --> 00:56:16,498
At last, Bruce Lee was to play the lead

827
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:18,849
in a Hollywood movie.

828
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:21,155
He applied all his energies
to his performance

829
00:56:21,156 --> 00:56:23,680
and worked closely
with director Robert Clouse

830
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:26,509
in staging all the martial
arts action in the film.

831
00:59:14,547 --> 00:59:16,983
Bruce Lee first formally
set out his methods

832
00:59:16,984 --> 00:59:18,419
in this early book,

833
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:22,293
Chinese Kung Fu, published in 1963.

834
00:59:22,294 --> 00:59:24,730
He also illustrated it
with precise drawings

835
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:26,864
which highlighted
every detail of the text.

836
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,838
The photographs were taken
in the parking lot

837
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:47,039
next to Ruby Chow's.

838
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,888
Two martial art students demonstrate

839
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:54,065
how some of these moves work in action.

840
01:01:30,465 --> 01:01:32,075
During his career,

841
01:01:32,076 --> 01:01:34,468
Bruce had never failed
to enlighten his peers

842
01:01:34,469 --> 01:01:37,689
with his in-depth
analysis of martial arts.

843
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:40,474
Well, gung fu is originated in China.

844
01:01:40,475 --> 01:01:44,739
It is the ancestor of karate and jujitsu.

845
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,480
It's more of a compete system

846
01:01:46,481 --> 01:01:47,873
and it's more fluid.

847
01:01:47,874 --> 01:01:49,222
By that I mean it's more flowing.

848
01:01:49,223 --> 01:01:50,832
There is continuity in movement

849
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:52,834
instead of one movement,

850
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:54,749
two movement and then stop.

851
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,751
The best example would be
a glass of water.

852
01:01:56,752 --> 01:02:01,756
Why? Because water is the
softest substance in the world,

853
01:02:01,757 --> 01:02:05,760
but yet it can penetrate
the hardest rock or anything,

854
01:02:05,761 --> 01:02:08,894
granite, you name it.

855
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:11,505
Water also is insubstantial.

856
01:02:11,506 --> 01:02:14,465
By that I mean
you cannot grasp hold of it.

857
01:02:14,466 --> 01:02:17,642
You cannot punch it and hurt it.

858
01:02:17,643 --> 01:02:19,731
So every gung fu man
is trying to do that,

859
01:02:19,732 --> 01:02:22,212
to be soft like water and flexible

860
01:02:22,213 --> 01:02:24,910
and adapt itself to the opponent.

861
01:02:24,911 --> 01:02:29,001
A karate punch is like an iron bar, wang!

862
01:02:29,002 --> 01:02:31,786
A gung fu punch is like an iron chain

863
01:02:31,787 --> 01:02:33,788
with an iron ball attached to the end,

864
01:02:33,789 --> 01:02:35,051
and it go wang!

865
01:02:35,052 --> 01:02:37,531
And it hurts inside.

866
01:02:37,532 --> 01:02:39,794
Well, gung fu can be practiced

867
01:02:39,795 --> 01:02:41,927
alone or with a partner.

868
01:02:41,928 --> 01:02:44,147
Practicing alone may involve forms.

869
01:02:44,148 --> 01:02:46,888
Some imitate a crane,

870
01:02:46,889 --> 01:02:50,240
a monkey, a praying mantis.

871
01:02:50,241 --> 01:02:52,894
This is a crane form.

872
01:02:52,895 --> 01:02:54,245
Start off.

873
01:03:00,903 --> 01:03:03,427
Many of the moves Bruce used in his films

874
01:03:03,428 --> 01:03:05,690
were designed more for a dramatic effect

875
01:03:05,691 --> 01:03:07,692
than as examples of Jeet Kune Do.

876
01:03:07,693 --> 01:03:09,607
It is also true

877
01:03:09,608 --> 01:03:12,871
that much was an accurate
exposition of his art.

878
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,788
Here he deals with
an attempted grab and throw,

879
01:03:19,966 --> 01:03:24,665
followed unwisely by an
attempt to sneak up behind.

880
01:03:24,666 --> 01:03:27,581
A defense and counter
to a clubbing attack

881
01:03:27,582 --> 01:03:28,975
from the side.

882
01:03:37,157 --> 01:03:39,419
A deadly two-handed knife attack

883
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,135
is foiled with the help of a jacket.

884
01:03:45,861 --> 01:03:48,341
Nunchaku against a sword.

885
01:03:48,342 --> 01:03:52,258
Even Bruce admits that
this a very uneven contest

886
01:03:52,259 --> 01:03:54,869
and would normally be avoided.

887
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:57,002
And it's not a situation
which many students today

888
01:03:57,003 --> 01:03:58,570
are likely to encounter.

889
01:04:08,362 --> 01:04:10,233
When used effectively,

890
01:04:10,234 --> 01:04:12,932
the wooden staff is an
excellent weapon against knives.

891
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:25,900
A seemingly impossible situation,

892
01:04:25,901 --> 01:04:28,121
an empty-handed defense against a sword.

893
01:04:34,345 --> 01:04:36,041
Only with incredible speed

894
01:04:36,042 --> 01:04:37,782
and almost psychic anticipation

895
01:04:37,783 --> 01:04:40,046
could anyone survive.

896
01:04:50,143 --> 01:04:52,057
Bruce was absolutely insistent

897
01:04:52,058 --> 01:04:54,059
about physical fitness.

898
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:55,539
He said, "Training is one of the most

899
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:57,976
neglected phases of athletics.

900
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,412
Too much time is given

901
01:04:59,413 --> 01:05:00,848
to the development of the skills

902
01:05:00,849 --> 01:05:02,415
and too little to the development

903
01:05:02,416 --> 01:05:05,592
of the individual
for participation."

904
01:05:05,593 --> 01:05:07,942
As I worked with him,
I don't think anyone ever

905
01:05:07,943 --> 01:05:10,554
trained as hard as Bruce did.

906
01:05:10,555 --> 01:05:11,946
I don't think anyone
in the world ever trained

907
01:05:11,947 --> 01:05:14,515
as dedicated a trainer as Bruce was.

908
01:05:16,213 --> 01:05:18,039
It is a popular belief that Bruce Lee

909
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,651
was born with an exceptional physique.

910
01:05:20,652 --> 01:05:23,436
Nothing could be further from the truth.

911
01:05:23,437 --> 01:05:26,570
As a child, he was rather frail.

912
01:05:26,571 --> 01:05:29,312
Reportedly, he never ate well at home,

913
01:05:29,313 --> 01:05:31,052
a habit which seemed to persist

914
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:34,230
even when he returned
to the United States.

915
01:05:34,231 --> 01:05:37,233
It was only through many
years of constant exercise

916
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:39,626
and finally reappraising
his dietary habits

917
01:05:39,627 --> 01:05:41,062
that he built himself

918
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:42,586
into the superb physical specimen

919
01:05:42,587 --> 01:05:44,066
he was to become.

920
01:05:59,734 --> 01:06:02,214
Bruce's emphasis on physical fitness

921
01:06:02,215 --> 01:06:05,304
opened up a new path
for martial art students.

922
01:06:05,305 --> 01:06:07,001
They followed his advice

923
01:06:07,002 --> 01:06:08,699
of applying modern exercising techniques

924
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:11,005
to the field of martial arts.

925
01:06:11,006 --> 01:06:13,747
They learned to appreciate
Bruce's outlook.

926
01:06:13,748 --> 01:06:15,358
"One may know all the fighting techniques

927
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,795
in the world, but if one is not fit

928
01:06:17,796 --> 01:06:20,277
one does not stand
a chance in a real fight."

929
01:06:26,544 --> 01:06:29,763
His fame and following grew and grew.

930
01:06:29,764 --> 01:06:32,636
Whole magazines were devoted
to one aspect or another

931
01:06:32,637 --> 01:06:35,291
of his life and career.

932
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:38,511
In the world of martial arts
and action movies,

933
01:06:38,512 --> 01:06:39,992
Bruce Lee was king.

934
01:06:51,177 --> 01:06:54,005
This is noted Taiwanese
actress Betty Ting Pei.

935
01:06:54,006 --> 01:06:56,747
Her undeniable charms had been revealed

936
01:06:56,748 --> 01:06:59,619
to good advantage in numerous film roles,

937
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,883
often as a seductress or femme fatale.

938
01:07:02,884 --> 01:07:05,712
For some three months, her
name had been romantically linked

939
01:07:05,713 --> 01:07:07,888
with that of Bruce Lee,

940
01:07:07,889 --> 01:07:10,195
as had many others in the past.

941
01:07:10,196 --> 01:07:12,719
Whether there is any truth
behind any of the stories

942
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,373
of these liaisons

943
01:07:14,374 --> 01:07:16,767
remains a matter of speculation.

944
01:07:16,768 --> 01:07:19,683
Certainly, though, it could
not have been a disadvantage

945
01:07:19,684 --> 01:07:21,337
for any ambitious young actress

946
01:07:21,338 --> 01:07:22,904
to be linked with Bruce Lee.

947
01:07:25,777 --> 01:07:29,693
On the afternoon of July 20th, 1973,

948
01:07:29,694 --> 01:07:32,957
Bruce Lee went to the
apartment of Betty Ting Pei.

949
01:07:32,958 --> 01:07:35,394
They were to meet Raymond
Chow later for dinner,

950
01:07:35,395 --> 01:07:37,571
an appointment
Bruce Lee was never to keep.

951
01:07:39,356 --> 01:07:41,357
He was rushed to hospital
in an ambulance.

952
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:43,881
Betty had phoned Raymond
Chow at the restaurant saying

953
01:07:43,882 --> 01:07:45,578
Bruce had laid down with a headache

954
01:07:45,579 --> 01:07:47,363
and she couldn't rouse him.

955
01:07:47,364 --> 01:07:49,060
Chow rushed to Betty's apartment.

956
01:07:49,061 --> 01:07:51,498
Doctors were called,
and finally an ambulance.

957
01:07:53,457 --> 01:07:55,762
Bruce Lee was certified dead on arrival

958
01:07:55,763 --> 01:07:57,374
at Queen Elizabeth Hospital.

959
01:08:00,202 --> 01:08:02,074
Hong Kong was stunned.

960
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:10,821
And as the word spread,
people read with shock

961
01:08:10,822 --> 01:08:12,040
and disbelief.

962
01:08:13,433 --> 01:08:15,782
The next day, thousands of people

963
01:08:15,783 --> 01:08:17,305
jammed the streets

964
01:08:17,306 --> 01:08:19,351
around the Kowloon Funeral Parlor.

965
01:08:19,352 --> 01:08:21,440
Several hundred
extra police were detailed

966
01:08:21,441 --> 01:08:24,269
to try to control the crowd.

967
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:26,837
No one could believe
that someone like Bruce Lee,

968
01:08:26,838 --> 01:08:30,363
so young, so fit, could just die.

969
01:08:42,506 --> 01:08:44,855
But Betty Ting Pei would say nothing.

970
01:08:44,856 --> 01:08:47,161
Bruce was my very best friend,

971
01:08:47,162 --> 01:08:49,425
but now he's gone.

972
01:08:49,426 --> 01:08:51,122
Bruce trusted me a lot.

973
01:08:51,123 --> 01:08:53,037
But at that time, I didn't want to

974
01:08:53,038 --> 01:08:55,300
nor do I need to explain anything.

975
01:08:55,301 --> 01:08:58,912
Because of our relationship,
I've been blamed unfairly.

976
01:08:58,913 --> 01:09:00,784
His death came as a shock

977
01:09:00,785 --> 01:09:03,308
and there has been
a lot of pressure on me.

978
01:09:03,309 --> 01:09:05,789
But I'll never let anything

979
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:08,792
spoil the relationship I had with Bruce.

980
01:09:08,793 --> 01:09:12,100
At the funeral, Linda arrived
with Raymond Chow.

981
01:09:36,473 --> 01:09:37,951
Above a portrait of Bruce

982
01:09:37,952 --> 01:09:40,476
is a banner in Chinese reading,

983
01:09:40,477 --> 01:09:42,261
"A star
sinks in a sea of art."

984
01:09:48,006 --> 01:09:50,443
All around are draped
thousands of tributes.

985
01:09:55,666 --> 01:09:59,669
Relatives and close friends
bow in respect.

986
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:02,454
Linda and the two children
are draped in the traditional

987
01:10:02,455 --> 01:10:03,935
white robes of mourning.

988
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:48,196
Members of the funeral party
filed past the open coffin.

989
01:10:51,765 --> 01:10:54,115
Few can hide their grief.

990
01:11:03,734 --> 01:11:07,433
Linda and the children take
a last look as they too leave.

991
01:11:47,995 --> 01:11:49,909
The public controversy

992
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:51,824
about Bruce Lee's death was still raging,

993
01:11:51,825 --> 01:11:53,826
but it was only at the Hong Kong airport,

994
01:11:53,827 --> 01:11:55,480
about to board a plane

995
01:11:55,481 --> 01:11:57,613
that was carrying
Bruce's body to Seattle,

996
01:11:57,614 --> 01:12:00,398
that Linda finally broke her silence.

997
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:02,792
It is my wish that the newspapers

998
01:12:02,793 --> 01:12:04,663
and the people of Hong Kong

999
01:12:04,664 --> 01:12:07,361
will stop speculating
on the circumstances

1000
01:12:07,362 --> 01:12:10,060
surrounding my husband's death.

1001
01:12:10,061 --> 01:12:13,367
Although we do not have
the final autopsy report,

1002
01:12:13,368 --> 01:12:15,369
I hold no suspicion of anything

1003
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:16,936
other than natural death.

1004
01:12:16,937 --> 01:12:19,852
I myself do not hold any person

1005
01:12:19,853 --> 01:12:22,986
or people responsible for his death.

1006
01:12:22,987 --> 01:12:25,858
Fate has ways we cannot change.

1007
01:12:25,859 --> 01:12:27,686
The only thing of importance is that

1008
01:12:27,687 --> 01:12:30,602
Bruce is gone and will not return.

1009
01:12:30,603 --> 01:12:33,997
He lives on in our memories
and through his films.

1010
01:12:33,998 --> 01:12:37,087
Please remember him
for his genius, his art

1011
01:12:37,088 --> 01:12:41,265
and the magic he brought
to every one of us.

1012
01:12:41,266 --> 01:12:43,397
For we who knew him very well,

1013
01:12:43,398 --> 01:12:45,878
his words and thoughts
will remain with us forever

1014
01:12:45,879 --> 01:12:48,839
and influence the rest of our lives.

1015
01:12:58,762 --> 01:13:01,633
In Seattle awaits Linda's family

1016
01:13:01,634 --> 01:13:04,724
and more bereaved relatives and friends.

1017
01:13:26,398 --> 01:13:28,617
And a second funeral.

1018
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:33,447
Beside the coffin was placed

1019
01:13:33,448 --> 01:13:38,626
a yin and yang symbol of Jeet Kune Do.

1020
01:13:38,627 --> 01:13:40,324
Among the many who came
to pay their respects

1021
01:13:40,325 --> 01:13:43,501
were friends and coworkers
like Dan Inosanto,

1022
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:45,895
Jim Kelly, Robert Clouse

1023
01:13:45,896 --> 01:13:47,636
and other actors and producers.

1024
01:14:12,096 --> 01:14:15,533
Former students James Coburn
and Steve McQueen

1025
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:18,319
silently recalled their
memories of their master.

1026
01:14:20,234 --> 01:14:23,411
Bruce's mother said her last goodbyes.

1027
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:29,460
And finally, Linda and the children,

1028
01:14:29,461 --> 01:14:31,028
Brandon and Shannon.

1029
01:14:59,447 --> 01:15:02,232
Coburn, McQueen and the other pallbearers

1030
01:15:02,233 --> 01:15:07,978
throw their white gloves
on the flower-decked casket.

1031
01:15:17,030 --> 01:15:20,641
And at last, it was over.

1032
01:15:20,642 --> 01:15:22,687
Or was it?

1033
01:15:22,688 --> 01:15:24,863
Back in Hong Kong, the inquest started,

1034
01:15:24,864 --> 01:15:27,779
and once again the public
began to speculate wildly

1035
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:29,433
on Betty Ting Pei's role

1036
01:15:29,434 --> 01:15:31,914
in relation to Bruce's untimely death.

1037
01:15:31,915 --> 01:15:36,396
At that time, there was a lot of talk,

1038
01:15:36,397 --> 01:15:38,398
scandalous rumors about us.

1039
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:41,184
I was under a lot of pressure,

1040
01:15:41,185 --> 01:15:43,316
but I told myself,

1041
01:15:43,317 --> 01:15:46,189
silence is the best answer.

1042
01:15:46,190 --> 01:15:50,715
I treasured Bruce's friendship very much.

1043
01:15:50,716 --> 01:15:53,587
That's why I have put up with the gossip

1044
01:15:53,588 --> 01:15:55,763
without saying anything to anyone.

1045
01:15:55,764 --> 01:15:59,028
The experts argued over
the results of the autopsy

1046
01:15:59,029 --> 01:16:01,465
until the court was satisfied

1047
01:16:01,466 --> 01:16:04,685
Bruce Lee had died of cerebral edema,

1048
01:16:04,686 --> 01:16:07,079
swelling of the brain
caused by hyper sensitivity

1049
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,734
to an ingredient of Equagesic,

1050
01:16:09,735 --> 01:16:13,433
the tablet he took
to relieve his headache.

1051
01:16:13,434 --> 01:16:17,176
The verdict, death by misadventure.

1052
01:16:17,177 --> 01:16:19,483
Bruce has left us.

1053
01:16:19,484 --> 01:16:23,704
For movies, it was the fall of a star.

1054
01:16:23,705 --> 01:16:28,318
For his fans, they have lost
their most respected idol,

1055
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:34,150
but most important, his family
lost their dearest one.

1056
01:16:34,151 --> 01:16:37,849
But for myself, I have lost
a very dear friend.

1057
01:16:37,850 --> 01:16:39,459
The coroner's verdict

1058
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:42,462
took some of the pressure
off Betty Ting Pei.

1059
01:16:42,463 --> 01:16:45,117
She resumed her film career.

1060
01:16:45,118 --> 01:16:47,119
But her subsequent evasive
public statements

1061
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,556
about Bruce Lee's death did
nothing to quell persistent

1062
01:16:49,557 --> 01:16:51,950
and popular rumors that Bruce had died

1063
01:16:51,951 --> 01:16:54,387
while they were making love.

1064
01:16:54,388 --> 01:16:56,389
Before long, she became a devout Buddhist

1065
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:58,565
and took to long periods of fasting.

1066
01:16:58,566 --> 01:17:01,786
It was not until 10 years after the event

1067
01:17:01,787 --> 01:17:04,136
that Betty Ting Pei went
on Hong Kong television

1068
01:17:04,137 --> 01:17:06,660
and for the first time denied that

1069
01:17:06,661 --> 01:17:08,358
she and Bruce had sexual relations

1070
01:17:08,359 --> 01:17:10,012
on the day of his death.

1071
01:17:10,013 --> 01:17:11,927
All she had done, she said,

1072
01:17:11,928 --> 01:17:13,972
was to let Bruce rest in her bed

1073
01:17:13,973 --> 01:17:16,323
and to give him the
painkiller for his headache.

1074
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:20,631
Letters continued to arrive

1075
01:17:20,632 --> 01:17:23,373
from Bruce's fans long after his death.

1076
01:17:23,374 --> 01:17:24,983
And there were others who saw it

1077
01:17:24,984 --> 01:17:27,246
as a great opportunity to be exploited.

1078
01:17:27,247 --> 01:17:30,511
Imitators on the screen
appeared by the score.

1079
01:17:54,927 --> 01:17:58,408
But there was one last
real Bruce Lee film.

1080
01:17:58,409 --> 01:18:00,453
He had shot many thousands
of feet of film

1081
01:18:00,454 --> 01:18:03,065
for Game of Death.

1082
01:18:03,066 --> 01:18:06,024
After his death, an extensive
worldwide search was done

1083
01:18:06,025 --> 01:18:08,113
to find someone who could possibly

1084
01:18:08,114 --> 01:18:10,899
double for Bruce in the missing scenes.

1085
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:19,430
Many candidates were flown
to Hong Kong for screen tests.

1086
01:18:48,894 --> 01:18:52,375
And from the film footage
of these screen tests,

1087
01:18:52,376 --> 01:18:54,116
two look-alikes were finally selected

1088
01:18:54,117 --> 01:18:56,118
to enact the missing scenes.

1089
01:18:56,119 --> 01:18:57,728
To complete the film,

1090
01:18:57,729 --> 01:19:00,252
Raymond Chow brought back Robert Clouse,

1091
01:19:00,253 --> 01:19:03,125
the director who had worked
with Bruce on Enter The Dragon.

1092
01:19:03,126 --> 01:19:05,953
On the first day of the
recommencement of filming,

1093
01:19:05,954 --> 01:19:09,348
the entire cast and crew took
part in a simple ceremony,

1094
01:19:09,349 --> 01:19:12,090
offering food and wine
and burning incense

1095
01:19:12,091 --> 01:19:15,355
to the spirit of Bruce Lee.

1096
01:19:21,666 --> 01:19:23,493
Well, how would you compare

1097
01:19:23,494 --> 01:19:25,408
Enter The Dragon with Game Of Death?

1098
01:19:25,409 --> 01:19:27,758
Right.

1099
01:19:27,759 --> 01:19:30,282
Enter The Dragonwas done about,

1100
01:19:30,283 --> 01:19:32,154
I guess, 6 or 7 years ago,

1101
01:19:32,155 --> 01:19:35,809
and, um, was, uh,

1102
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:39,509
the, uh, last picture that Bruce made.

1103
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:41,511
And then, of course, now Game Of Death.

1104
01:19:41,512 --> 01:19:46,429
It's a very large film.

1105
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:48,344
Production is large.

1106
01:19:48,345 --> 01:19:53,175
Most of the leading actors
are from United States.

1107
01:19:53,176 --> 01:19:54,959
Hugh O'Brian, Gig Young,

1108
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,050
Dean Jagger, Colleen Camp, so on.

1109
01:20:00,444 --> 01:20:03,837
It did really very well on the film.

1110
01:20:03,838 --> 01:20:05,100
It's interesting

1111
01:20:05,101 --> 01:20:09,060
because the film was about a third done

1112
01:20:09,061 --> 01:20:10,670
before Bruce died.

1113
01:20:10,671 --> 01:20:13,847
There's a good question
in some people's mind

1114
01:20:13,848 --> 01:20:16,546
as to whether Bruce did die.

1115
01:20:16,547 --> 01:20:17,591
Of course, I've always been

1116
01:20:17,592 --> 01:20:19,418
a fan of Bruce Lee's

1117
01:20:19,419 --> 01:20:22,465
as millions of people
have throughout the world,

1118
01:20:22,466 --> 01:20:26,469
Russell, so I was actually
very thrilled to be in

1119
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:29,080
something which I consider

1120
01:20:29,081 --> 01:20:32,083
in many ways not historical,

1121
01:20:32,084 --> 01:20:36,696
but to capture the footage

1122
01:20:36,697 --> 01:20:39,221
that Bruce Lee had already shot

1123
01:20:39,222 --> 01:20:41,092
when he unfortunately died.

1124
01:20:41,093 --> 01:20:43,442
A traditional Chinese lion dance

1125
01:20:43,443 --> 01:20:45,227
has always been a powerful means

1126
01:20:45,228 --> 01:20:47,011
of bringing in good fortune

1127
01:20:47,012 --> 01:20:49,318
and dispelling evil spirits.

1128
01:20:49,319 --> 01:20:51,015
It's not so surprising

1129
01:20:51,016 --> 01:20:53,191
that the reworked plot
of the prophetically titled

1130
01:20:53,192 --> 01:20:55,541
Game of Death found room
for a chase scene

1131
01:20:55,542 --> 01:20:57,544
through just such a spell.

1132
01:20:59,329 --> 01:21:01,721
Not all the action would be kung fu.

1133
01:21:01,722 --> 01:21:03,767
Top Hollywood stuntmen
were brought to Hong Kong

1134
01:21:03,768 --> 01:21:05,291
for these exciting scenes.

1135
01:21:07,206 --> 01:21:09,773
You all right, Billy?

1136
01:21:09,774 --> 01:21:12,124
Yeah. All right. Love it.

1137
01:21:23,527 --> 01:21:24,745
Is Billy okay?

1138
01:21:26,225 --> 01:21:27,879
Nice one, nice one.

1139
01:21:52,556 --> 01:21:55,297
There were many who thought
it could never be done,

1140
01:21:55,298 --> 01:21:57,516
but in 1978, Game Of Death

1141
01:21:57,517 --> 01:21:59,301
was finally completed,

1142
01:21:59,302 --> 01:22:02,217
and fans all over the
world could see at last

1143
01:22:02,218 --> 01:22:03,784
the final work of Bruce Lee.

1144
01:23:46,322 --> 01:23:47,522
How do you like that?

1145
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:05,024
Today, his popularity
has hardly diminished.

1146
01:26:05,025 --> 01:26:06,765
He's still a popular feature of movie

1147
01:26:06,766 --> 01:26:09,812
and martial arts magazines
of many countries.

1148
01:26:09,813 --> 01:26:13,163
The Bruce Lee imitators
have faded into obscurity,

1149
01:26:13,164 --> 01:26:16,471
but perhaps a new
young star like Jackie Chan

1150
01:26:16,472 --> 01:26:18,821
can rise to the same heights,

1151
01:26:18,822 --> 01:26:22,215
a different kind of star
with his own unique style.

1152
01:26:22,216 --> 01:26:23,783
Hold it!
Get down!

1153
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:26,655
What's going on?

1154
01:26:26,656 --> 01:26:28,092
Look out!

1155
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:47,458
But even a star like Jackie Chan

1156
01:26:47,459 --> 01:26:50,330
does not claim to be the new Bruce Lee.

1157
01:26:50,331 --> 01:26:52,333
There will never be a new Bruce Lee.

1158
01:26:55,685 --> 01:27:00,384
Bruce Lee has gone,
but his spirit lives on.

1159
01:27:00,385 --> 01:27:03,083
This is Bruce Lee, the legend.
