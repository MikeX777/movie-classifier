00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:55,574
<i>Happy Halloween,
Happy Halloween.</i>

2
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:59,511
<i>Postal Service. Who's got mail?
The Postal Service. Don't let them get me.</i>

3
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:03,882
<i>Bright light. Bright light. Stay out
of the light. Stay out of the light.</i>

4
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:05,884
<i>Whose clothes is that?
Whose bra? Whose bra?</i>

5
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,687
<i>Sally the salvia plant.
Makes good beer. Makes good beer.</i>

00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:12,791
<i>God Particle. God Particle.
Oh, fuck, who's that? Nice butt.</i>

7
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:16,762
<i>Two minutes. I got to take my meds. I got
to take my meds. I got to take my meds.</i>

8
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:20,666
<i>I'm out of Xanax. I got to take new Xanax.
Where's my Xanax?</i>

9
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:22,634
<i>Two minutes till 8:00.
Two minutes till 8:00.</i>

10
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:25,254
<i>I got to take a pill.
I got to take a pill.</i>

11
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:27,873
<i>Just a... just a half. I got to take
a pill. I got to take new Xanax.</i>

12
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:32,844
<i>Take the half. Take the half. Which one?
Which one? Which one do I... take the half.</i>

<i>Who's the girl? Who's the girl?
One minute till 8:00.</i>

00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:39,518
<i>Vodka. Vodka. One minute,
one minute till 8:00.</i>

15
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,553
<i>Eight o'clock. Eight o'clock.
Eight o'clock.</i>

16
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,601
<i>What happened last night?</i>

17
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:01,907
<i>Did I solve the equation?</i>

18
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:12,884
<i>Nice butt.</i>

19
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,305
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

20
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:36,308
<i>How long was I out? Ahh!</i>

21
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:31,998
Okay.

22
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:42,000
What the?

23
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:43,935
Ooh!

24
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:45,704
Whoa!

25
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:58,450
- Uh...
- We have to go.

26
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,424
What? Why?

27
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:35,915
Get down!

28
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,253
- Seriously?
- Shh!

29
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:45,857
- I'm gonna scream if you don't...
- No!

30
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:52,797
Don't make me scream rape!

31
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,066
- No, please.
- I'm gonna!

32
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:58,570
I'll let you go,
just don't stand in the window.

33
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,139
What? Why?

34
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:04,226
I'll tell you in the car.

35
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:07,312
- You're gonna take me to class?
- There are no more classes.

36
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:10,248
- Dude, I think you did too much last night...
- We have to go!

37
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:14,252
- Would you let me up, will you?
- Will you stay out of the light?

38
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,887
Just get off of me!

39
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,279
- We don't have much time.
- Well, I'm still not entirely sure what's going on.

40
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:45,917
Or where the fuck I am. So if you want to
enlighten me, I'd really appreciate it.

41
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:49,321
- It's not good.
- What's not good?

42
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,923
- I got the call.
- Ah, why didn't you just say so?

43
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,594
- Well, in that case, we'd really better go, huh?
- Yes, we must.

44
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:58,764
- Perfect.
- You ready?

45
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,933
No! Holy shit, weirdo! I'm gonna
stand up now. Is that okay?

46
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:02,935
No!

47
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:05,237
Why not?

48
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,942
- Don't let them see you.
- Who is out there?

49
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,312
Has there been
another school shooting?

50
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,750
The Postal Service.

51
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:24,022
- You mean the mailman?
- Not exactly.

52
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,626
- Are you missing some mail?
- We have to go.

53
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:30,196
Why?

54
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,300
It's our destiny.

55
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,639
Jesus, what's with you, man?

56
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:44,175
You almost had me!
You almost had me.

57
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,277
- Stay down!
- Ow!

58
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,849
Get off! Ow! Get off me.

59
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:57,222
- Ah!
- All right, freak. Let's get one thing straight.

60
00:10:57,224 --> 00:11:00,091
You seem to be a relatively confused
person, and I'm all for that usually,

61
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:02,394
given my own state of being
most of the time.

62
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,696
Hell, I think we naturally probably
had a pretty good time last night

63
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:07,032
considering how shitty
my head feels right now,

64
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:10,201
and the increasingly embarrassing
fact that I have no clothes on,

65
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:14,305
but alas, I am in no mood to
play Twister with you anymore,

66
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:18,977
and frankly, I need to grab my gear and
need to make it to Psych class in...

67
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,882
Now.
So I'm gonna say this again.

68
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,950
You're gonna let me
leave this room,

69
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,286
and I'm gonna forget
this shit ever happened

70
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,789
and spare you
the humiliation of campus police

71
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,511
coming to bust your little
whatever that is!

72
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,063
Armageddon.

73
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:42,934
- Huh?
- Emergency survival gear. I packed.

74
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,936
- You packed?
- Yeah.

75
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:47,772
- For Armageddon?
- To make it to the launch pad.

76
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:51,142
- Launchpad?
- Yes, in Pasadena. Outside Los Angeles.

77
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:52,911
And who's outside?

78
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:57,949
Have you seen
the movie Terminatrix?

79
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:11,730
The Postal Service.

80
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:17,936
I really should go. I have an extra
ticket, but if you're not interested...

81
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,871
I need a ticket? To where?

82
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:23,908
- Can you let go of my balls, please?
- Oh, sorry.

83
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,065
Hey.

84
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:57,836
What the fuck?

85
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,286
Holy shit.

86
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:13,912
- Psst! Hey!
- Ha!

87
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,046
You!

88
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,255
- Dude!
- Oh! Ooh!

89
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,295
Dude!

90
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:32,931
Hey!

91
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,062
Hello?

92
00:16:07,734 --> 00:16:09,233
I think they're here.

93
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:12,537
- Who?
- I don't know, the mail guy?

94
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,539
I knew they'd come.
I really have to go now.

95
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,441
You can't leave me here.

96
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:19,077
- Why not?
- Because.

97
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:22,680
- Because why?
- Because...

98
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:30,655
I'm pregnant.

99
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,324
Ah, shit!

100
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,596
Really?

101
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,164
Yeah. Fuck!

102
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,735
Grab what you can.
Suunnee's out back! Let's go!

103
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,427
This is Suunnee.

104
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:13,264
- This is your car?
- Yeah, it's my baby. Why? What's wrong?

105
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:16,634
- Are you okay?
- Am I okay? Are you okay?

106
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,271
- First, how about a little help here?
- Oops, sorry.

107
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,749
Oh! Ouch.

108
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,419
Take off those goddamn
bug-eyed goggles.

109
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:39,757
Are you honestly making me carry
around a sex doll in an icebox?

110
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:44,595
Careful. It's
a floatation device.

111
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:48,199
Floatation? Seems awfully anatomically
correct for a pool floaty.

112
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,534
What are we,
going on vacation here?

113
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:51,636
I don't know
if you're gonna understand.

114
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:54,605
- Try me.
- Okay, if the universe we're in, we're just one dimension.

115
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,075
Based on my probability
calculations of the multiverse,

116
00:17:57,077 --> 00:18:00,545
there's an 18.46% chance we're
gonna need this blood transfusion.

117
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:05,383
And in an outcome, 14.75% chance
we might need the hot babe floaty,

118
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:07,351
12.5%, the solar cells.

119
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,620
Whoa whoa whoa,
slow down there, Einstein.

120
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:12,190
I can barely understand
a word you're saying.

121
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:13,758
- Multi what?
- Multiverse.

122
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,460
- Multi hearse?
- Multiverse.

123
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,795
- Purse?
- Verse. Multiple universe.

124
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,398
Look, man, I don't even remember
having sex with you last night,

125
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,366
but I can assure you
it's not gonna happen again.

126
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:24,569
Let alone multi-whatever-
you're-thinking.

127
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,671
Multiverse. Quantum mechanics.

128
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:33,678
- Wait, what major are you?
- Theoretical Physics.

129
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,747
- What major are you?
- General Studies.

130
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:37,849
What's that?

131
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:42,420
It's a combination
of psychology, art, and music.

132
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,106
That's fantastic.

133
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:46,890
Look, brain queef, why are
we bringing a surfboard

134
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:49,494
and do-it-yourself floatation
doll to some launch pad?

135
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:51,696
Should I grab
my bikini and guitar?

136
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:53,831
And where the fuck
is everybody, anyway?

137
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,836
Look, Ms. General Studies,

138
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:01,239
you clearly won't get this.

139
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,307
- Educate me.
- Okay.

140
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,644
Have you ever
heard of entanglement?

141
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,713
You mean what I can't
remember what we did last night?

142
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:12,383
Not that entanglement.
Spooky Action at a Distance.

143
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,685
Jesus, man! It doesn't
matter if I'm near or far.

144
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:18,456
- It's not happening again!
- Not necessarily.

145
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,159
Time is an illusion.

146
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:26,531
As far as we know it, it's never
actually not happening.

147
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,400
Let me take it
from the top. All right.

148
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,802
The first discoveries
of quantum physics

149
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:34,705
were that the observation
itself creates changes

150
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:38,676
in the outcome of the event,
but the future affects the past.

151
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:48,419
Then Spooky Action at a Distance
Theory was conceived of in the 1930s,

152
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,688
and it wasn't
until 30 years later

153
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,393
that Freedman and Clauser's pioneering
experiments proved particles entangle.

154
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,863
Almost like mirror
each other and therein,

155
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:04,468
can relate like two rolling dice
that always land on the same numbers.

156
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,972
Even across space-time
at inconceivable distances.

157
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,711
This is what makes
teleportation possible,

158
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,813
which I wrote
my freshman thesis on.

159
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:20,785
See, we can literally jump dimensions
if we deal with it on a quantum level,

160
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:23,221
particle by particle.

161
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,489
Almost like stepping
through a wormhole.

162
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:33,631
Boom, boom.
Here - there, instantaneously.

163
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:36,634
Same place, same time, even.

164
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:37,868
Boom, boom.

165
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:39,437
So.

166
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:45,876
If we can get to the launch pad by
November 11th, at 11/11, 11:00 a.m.

167
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,511
<i>we can get off this Earth.</i>

168
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,783
We can meet my family
at International Space Station.

169
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,952
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa, Thomas Edison.

170
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:57,521
November 11th?
That's, like, in two weeks.

171
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:59,323
Yeah. In this dream I had,

172
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,592
my counselor told me there are
many ways this could play out.

173
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,728
In one,
I was told to bring this.

174
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,398
In another, we might need this.

175
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,901
- In another, we might need this.
- Told by who, McGillicutty?

176
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:12,436
The counselor.

177
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,939
Oh, good.
That's a little better.

178
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:18,342
I was hoping we wouldn't go too far
without talking to a specialist.

179
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:19,344
Good.

180
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:24,915
Where is this counselor?

181
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:30,288
You see yours when you're
meant to see yours.

182
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:37,528
I'd like to see a counselor right now.
Right fucking now.

183
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,563
You should've
kept your pants on, Kara.

184
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,433
You should've kept
your god damn pants on!

185
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:44,886
Sister Mary had it right.

186
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,247
Maybe complete abstinence is
better than perfect moderation.

187
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:50,308
Maybe this is the lesson
I'm finally meant to learn.

188
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:51,943
Whatever.

189
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,478
Holy shit!

190
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:58,516
Holy shit!

191
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,618
Where the fuck is Bernie?

192
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,888
- Who?
- Bernie, my purse.

193
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:07,825
I had him when we left, and then you
made me carry all this stupid shit,

194
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:09,760
and the strap probably broke.

195
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,796
- Blame it on me now...
- Fucking...

196
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:17,094
Wow, what the fuck was that?

197
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:19,463
Sounded like
a gravitational ripple.

198
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,766
- Cool.
- A what?-?

199
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:25,403
Two black holes
collided 4 billion years ago.

200
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:29,807
- I was expecting that last week.
- But it came from over there.

201
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,442
- No, it didn't.
- Yes, it did.

202
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:33,778
- Not necessarily.
- Oh, whatever.

203
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,500
I'll be right back.

204
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,952
Just remember,
if you go around that corner,

205
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:44,855
we may not be in the same
dimension anymore.

206
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,624
Well, I got to get Bernie.

207
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:09,814
There you are.

208
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:22,893
<i>Agent 1, they are out of the room.
You are clear to proceed.</i>

209
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:11,101
Hey.

210
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,737
- Huh?
- Do you need some help?

211
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:15,940
Oh, yeah, sure, thanks, man.

212
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27,184
I figure we need
to get some food.

213
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:28,986
I don't know about you,
but I'm starving.

214
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:30,821
Yeah, I could
really go for some food.

215
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:33,591
- What are you in the mood for?
- Uh, anything healthy.

216
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:36,994
Me too. I'm on this diet.
I'm at 8.2% body fat,

217
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:39,863
and I have to go below 5% to
match Brad Pitt in<i> Fight Club</i>.

218
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:44,168
- Well, why is that, exactly?
- I'm shooting a music video.

219
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:47,738
- You... you're a musician?
- Oh, yeah.

220
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:51,342
- What kind of music?
- I'm a rapper.

221
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,863
Music is the common language
of vibration energy.

222
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:15,065
It bonds us.

223
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:18,302
It transcends us into
higher versions of ourselves.

224
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:25,075
Creativity itself, quite literally
is the intersection of dimensions.

225
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:28,312
We're gonna need it
where we're going!

226
00:28:57,203 --> 00:29:01,138
- Oh, I got that.
- Okay, take it easy.

227
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,442
- Okay, you just need to be careful.
- Just trying to be helpful.

228
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:10,147
Thank you. Get in.
I'll take care of Tank.

229
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,218
Okay.

230
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,875
Uh... What the fuck is this?

231
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:38,909
It's a mini fridge.

232
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:42,913
- What for?
- Drinks.

233
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:45,516
- For when you drive?
- Oh, God, no. I don't drink and drive.

234
00:29:45,518 --> 00:29:49,119
- So this is for guests?
- Of course.

235
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,941
I figure if I'm gonna drive,
I'm gonna have style.

236
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:14,545
I always wanted
a muscle car. Ready?

237
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:08,999
Salvia was a secret plant.
They were hiding it for a real long time.

238
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:11,635
- Who was?
- The government and the tribes.

239
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:17,174
It's known as Sage of the Diviners.
Ska Maria Pastora.

240
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:20,878
Seared sage is believed to be an
incarnation of the Virgin Mary.

241
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:25,415
Mazatec shamans
use it for religious purposes.

242
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:28,585
Its natural habitat
is in the cloud force

243
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:32,055
in the isolated Sierra Mazateca
of Oaxaca, Mexico,

244
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:36,093
but it's really believed
to be brought to the planet...

245
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:40,330
not to have,
like, originated here.

246
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:45,535
- Why?
- Because its reproductive system is so different.

247
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:47,271
It's very hard to figure out.

248
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:49,439
It's, like, it was
just one plant found,

249
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:52,676
like it was
a four-dimensional... accident

250
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:55,112
that just slipped out
or crashed on some asteroid.

251
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:59,182
Either way,
I think it caused my DR.

252
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:02,052
- Your what?
- Derealization.

253
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:05,522
- What's that?
- It's like being stoned all the time.

254
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:11,328
I'm very sensitive to light.
I have panic attacks.

255
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,931
It could be
neurological or psychological.

256
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,499
How many times did you do it?

257
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,235
Salvia? Three or four times.

258
00:32:18,237 --> 00:32:21,338
- Wow.
- You lose a thousand years in your mind.

259
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,241
There's no time limit.
That's the problem.

260
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:27,311
Just like it should be
in fourth dimension. All is one.

261
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:29,479
Gravitational force
is tearing you apart.

262
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:33,150
Eventually, it takes, like,
15 minutes to get back to your reality.

263
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,621
And it was so crazy.
I took another dose right away.

264
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:42,125
I needed to figure it out,
so I took 120 extract.

265
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:45,228
- People usually do five.
- Oh, whoa!

266
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:59,042
<i>The spirit
of Salvia is always a woman,</i>

267
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:03,013
<i>and I experienced a cube
in a cube in a cube situation.</i>

268
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:05,148
<i>I get pushed away
from the future.</i>

269
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,251
<i>You think that you can never come
back, that you're stuck.</i>

270
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:11,755
<i>You also become objects,
like a person's shoe</i>

271
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:14,691
<i>or something quantizable.</i>

272
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:44,421
<i>Agent 1,
terminate search. Pursue the target.</i>

273
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:46,323
<i>Sending new coordinates now.</i>

274
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:59,803
<i>And then... I was
there, at the source.</i>

275
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:02,572
<i>All was one.</i>

276
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,410
<i>Singularity...</i>

277
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:10,113
<i>Until I started sweeping back.</i>

278
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:12,783
<i>When you come back,
you come back part by part.</i>

279
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:17,621
<i>You feel an insane pull of something
else different at the top of your head.</i>

280
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:21,792
<i>Like a connection to the Cosmo,
and you have no idea what's going on.</i>

281
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:24,227
<i>Because when you're on it,
you have no idea.</i>

282
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,780
<i>You don't remember
you smoking it.</i>

283
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:29,332
<i>Eventually, it takes, like,
15 minutes to get back to yourself.</i>

284
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:33,770
And everyone goes to the same
place when you're on salvia.

285
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:36,106
Everyone sees the same stuff.

286
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:39,810
- Really?
- Yeah.

287
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,780
Everyone who does it describes
the same kind of thing.

288
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:46,516
<i>The woman. The cubes.</i>

289
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:49,619
No way.

290
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:58,261
Yeah. I almost wish I never
smoked it in my entire life.

291
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:03,200
Yet, I cannot name anything that
has been as profound as that.

292
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,136
Where'd you get it?

293
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:14,744
The deep web. The vinyl highway.

294
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:18,248
Once you smoke it...
the doors open.

295
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:23,687
It's not like LSD. Once you have
it, you can never take it back.

296
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:26,223
The door cannot be shut.

297
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:30,327
- No ticket back?
- No round-trip ticket.

298
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:33,430
No round-trip ticket?

299
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:37,901
And do not operate mechanical
machinery while on it.

300
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:43,473
You have to have a sitter.
You can't do it by yourself.

301
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:47,177
Perceptions are gone.
You're not seeing anything.

302
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:53,583
Excessive laughter and crying.
Both at the same time.

303
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:56,686
- Drooling.
- Drooling?

304
00:35:57,556 --> 00:35:58,556
Ick.

305
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:02,626
Ah, dude? We have to go.

306
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:25,916
Woah!

307
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,522
Man, don't worry. I'm a perfect driver.
I never had a speeding ticket.

308
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,728
<i>Ah, damn it.</i>

309
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,263
What's wrong?

310
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:14,965
I forgot something.

311
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:25,342
What? What are you doing?

312
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,244
It's fine. It will
take me a second.

313
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:30,013
You're literally out of your mind.
The mail guy is there.

314
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:32,649
- No, no, it's fine.
- No, no, it's not fine!

315
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:52,736
- Holy shit!
- What?

316
00:37:52,738 --> 00:37:56,539
- That's... Him!
- What?

317
00:37:56,908 --> 00:38:00,310
- Gun it!
- I can't do that. It would be very dangerous.

318
00:38:00,312 --> 00:38:01,678
Gun. It.

319
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:04,014
Don't you see?

320
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:07,651
- Don't you see?
- See what?

321
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:22,732
Oh.

322
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:26,569
- What the fuck, man?
- What the fuck?

323
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:30,473
What the fuck? What the fuck?
What the fuck was that?

324
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:34,377
Jesus. You almost shot
us through space-time.

325
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:39,549
Are you insane?
You're insane. He's insane.

326
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:43,086
Or maybe he's on salvia.
Or maybe I'm on salvia.

327
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:44,721
Did you give me salvia?

328
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:47,991
Everybody needs
to calm the fuck down.

329
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,364
He's coming. He's coming.
He is on his way here.

330
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:57,867
Everything's fine. I have no idea
what you're freaking out about.

331
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:02,038
What I'm freaking out about?
Your little head got me into this mess.

332
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,940
Your big head better get me out!

333
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:09,646
Okay. Fine. Forget about it.
I don't need to get it anyway.

334
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:32,001
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

335
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:34,938
Oh, my God,
oh, my God, Oh, my God!

336
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:55,024
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God! Jesus...

337
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:58,561
I know.
I know it's been a while.

338
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:02,732
Don't be mad. Like, a long time.

339
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,969
- What? We're fine.
- Do not tell me we are fine!

340
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:09,472
I don't know why you're so worked up.
I mean, it's not that big a deal.

341
00:40:09,474 --> 00:40:12,409
What in the Holy Grail
are you talking about?

342
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:14,110
Did you not see him?

343
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,880
- See who?
- Your mail dude. Whatever.

344
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:19,983
- You mean you saw the Postal Service?
- Yes!

345
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:25,488
- You saw the Postal Service?
- Yeah, I saw the guy.

346
00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:27,624
What did he look like?

347
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:33,596
He looked like... like a guy.

348
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,199
- That's good. Very general.
- He's like an agent guy!

349
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:38,701
- Like an agent?
- Yeah, you know?

350
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:42,071
- Like, with that look.
- That look like...?

351
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:46,142
- The Terminatrix look.
- Wow.

352
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:49,078
- Fuck wow!
- Interesting.

353
00:40:49,748 --> 00:40:52,682
Interesting? Aren't you
trying to avoid them?

354
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:55,218
Like, for Armageddon reasons?

355
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,754
- No.
- No?

356
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:02,559
Do you mind if I smoke?

357
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:04,561
- No.
- Great.

358
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,737
No, yes,
I mind if you fucking smoke!

359
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:16,806
No? No?

360
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:21,110
- You're not trying to run from the agent guy?
- No. Why would I do that?

361
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:27,484
Correct me
if I'm wrong here, Einstein.

362
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:30,987
Does the sexy guy
in the cool glasses

363
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:34,057
have anything to do with our
mission to get across the county?

364
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:40,530
- Probably.
- And what exactly is his probable role in this equation?

365
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:44,934
I don't know. He probably has a high
probability of being your counselor.

366
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:48,238
Oh, my counselor?
Why is he my counselor?

367
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,207
I don't know.
You saw him. I didn't.

368
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:54,644
Which makes me
to believe that like I said,

369
00:41:54,646 --> 00:42:00,183
what reality you're living in is
yours, and what I'm in is mine.

370
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:04,220
Has anyone ever told you that you're
not exactly right in the head?

371
00:42:04,756 --> 00:42:06,289
Singularity is within, man.

372
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:09,225
- The sooner you...
- You let me out of this fucking car!

373
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:11,528
- Whoa!
- Let me out!

374
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,664
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Let me out! Let me out!

375
00:42:20,105 --> 00:42:25,208
Like, like... oh! Oh! Like...

376
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,311
I just... I just need to... I...

377
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:32,749
- Get off of me!
- Ah, okay, okay, okay!

378
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:37,620
This is, like...
This is, like, it?

379
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:40,023
I mean, is he my punishment?

380
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:43,660
'Cause I didn't
treat Mom and Dad with respect?

381
00:42:44,763 --> 00:42:49,232
Dad was always an asshole, and Mom,
she just did it for the money, right?

382
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:54,237
I didn't want to find
their smutty videos

383
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,773
in the VCR player
Christmas morning!

384
00:42:56,775 --> 00:43:00,777
I didn't ask to be stuck between
their fucked up battles of infidelity

385
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:04,347
and I needed glasses
way before 8th grade!

386
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:08,718
You want me to repent?

387
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,323
Am I supposed to confess?

388
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:15,325
How?

389
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:19,028
There's nobody left
to confess to!

390
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:26,169
And even if there was, I mean, it's
not my fault I was made this way, God!

391
00:43:26,905 --> 00:43:28,905
They put me in Catholic School,

392
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:33,876
which if you haven't been paying
attention, is fucked up!

393
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:41,017
You think I wanted to have my virginity
taken by a dirty priest at 15?

394
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:44,788
I didn't taunt him.

395
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,190
They made us wear these
little skirts and knee socks.

396
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:50,960
Sick, twisted fucks.

397
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:56,065
- It's a good look.
- Shut up!

398
00:43:57,936 --> 00:44:01,671
Sure, there's a little
part of me that liked it.

399
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:06,009
But isn't that what you do?

400
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:10,713
You put us in these
shitty situations...

401
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,183
that we have to
fucking deal with?

402
00:44:14,185 --> 00:44:18,788
That are impossible to begin with,
and then you give us the choice?

403
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,890
Do good or evil.

404
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:28,031
Well, let me say this again:
Go fuck yourself!

405
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:29,666
Fuck yourself!

406
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:33,269
I've had just about enough
of the cards I've been dealt,

407
00:44:34,673 --> 00:44:37,106
and now you give me this guy?

408
00:44:39,778 --> 00:44:40,943
No disrespect.

409
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,446
You don't look like Satan.

410
00:44:44,683 --> 00:44:47,884
I figured he'd be a little bit
sexier than you!

411
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:53,189
But that's the joke, right?

412
00:44:55,093 --> 00:44:58,161
It's like tailored to me.
It's so specific.

413
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:04,400
I get it. This is Hell.

414
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:10,239
You can tell me.
This is it, isn't it?

415
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:12,141
Well, I can't
tell you that for sure,

416
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:14,944
but I'd rather not get into
religion with you right now, okay?

417
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:18,748
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you're right.

418
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:21,718
Let's not talk about God.

419
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:24,454
Let's not talk about God.

420
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,324
- What are we going to do?
- Yeah, good, okay.

421
00:45:28,326 --> 00:45:32,462
What we're gonna do is,
we're gonna get back into Suunnee,

422
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:35,398
- and we're gonna drive.
- Oh, we're gonna drive?

423
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,434
Where are we gonna drive?
To Pasadena?

424
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:41,204
- Yeah.
- If we're gonna drive, then I want...

425
00:45:41,206 --> 00:45:43,973
I want... I want my guitar.

426
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:48,444
If I am gonna have to do this with
you, I need my guitar.

427
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:49,979
Oh, sure.

428
00:45:51,216 --> 00:45:54,817
We need your guitar.
I didn't know you played guitar.

429
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:56,219
Yeah, I do.

430
00:45:56,221 --> 00:46:00,490
- I'm a singer/songwriter.
- You're a singer/songwriter?

431
00:46:00,492 --> 00:46:05,328
- I am.
- Like, uh, Taylor Swift?

432
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,530
No, not like Taylor Swift.

433
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,168
Not like bad Taylor Swift. Why?
What's wrong with Taylor Swift?

434
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:18,007
It's nothing, nothing. It's nothing personal.
It's just, uh, not my thing, that's all.

435
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:20,343
You know, just don't.
Just get back in the car.

436
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:22,328
- Okay, well...
- Get back in the car!

437
00:46:22,329 --> 00:46:24,312
- Just get back in the goddamn car and just let me...
- What'd I say?

438
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:26,082
- What'd you say?
- What'd I say?

439
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:30,453
- What'd I say?
- What'd you say? What'd you say? Amazing!

440
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,021
Just kill it!

441
00:46:33,258 --> 00:46:36,893
- What the fuck is that sound?
- The bowling ball.

442
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:43,499
- You mean my brain.
- I'm sorry, man.

443
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,869
The first few times I tried to
wrap my head around quantum theory,

444
00:46:46,871 --> 00:46:48,888
it's, like, crazy, man.

445
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,906
They say if you think
you understand it, you don't.

446
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:52,975
And I was just
trying to make small talk.

447
00:46:52,977 --> 00:46:58,481
So give this to me again. Do you or
do you not see the car following us?

448
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:04,187
- I'm sorry.
- You don't?

449
00:47:04,189 --> 00:47:07,156
It's true. Unless I'm tripping,
or maybe you are.

450
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,826
If that's the case, it'd be
a good time to share it.

451
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:16,933
Okay, so I'm
officially losing it.

452
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:18,935
No, I tried
to explain this to you.

453
00:47:18,937 --> 00:47:23,005
I'm gonna listen
again. I'm gonna listen.

454
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:26,008
Go ahead.

455
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:08,017
So like I said, it's got nothing
to do with me or my reality.

456
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:12,421
Ah, yes, multiverse.

457
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:18,227
- So who are you running from?
- Nobody.

458
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:32,108
But you said to go and to stay
out of the light and the mailman.

459
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:34,110
The Postal Service?

460
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:36,111
Yeah, he needs to be avoided.
I hate getting bills.

461
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:38,447
Bills? Like, credit card bills?

462
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:43,252
No, last time I got the mail,
I got a recall notice on my car,

463
00:48:44,055 --> 00:48:46,022
and I can't give Suunnee up.

464
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:49,659
I mean, I'm just trying to get
to the launch pad on time.

465
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:51,560
Will you stay out of the light?

466
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:53,095
Don't let them see you.

467
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,747
Launchpad.

468
00:48:54,748 --> 00:48:56,398
Emergency survival
gear. I packed.

469
00:48:58,169 --> 00:49:00,670
It could be
neurological or psychological.

470
00:49:00,672 --> 00:49:03,973
And meet my family,
and you're pregnant,

471
00:49:03,975 --> 00:49:08,110
and I'm not leaving my baby mama and
future offspring on the dying Earth.

472
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:11,614
I am not
fucking pregnant, you dip!

473
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:30,166
- You lied to me?
- Lied to you? Yes!

474
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:37,640
You lied to me. That's, like...

475
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:40,476
The worst thing you can do.

476
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,012
Are you out of your mind?

477
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:51,520
It's okay. This is good news.

478
00:49:51,522 --> 00:49:54,023
I'm on the pill
for just this reason.

479
00:49:55,193 --> 00:49:56,325
Good news?

480
00:49:57,595 --> 00:49:58,527
Yeah.

481
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:02,064
Though, it does cause
some erratic mood swings.

482
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:04,567
I might change the prescription.

483
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:09,405
I thought I
was going to be a dad.

484
00:50:11,142 --> 00:50:13,676
Uh, oh, man.

485
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:16,045
Well, I'm sorry.

486
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:18,714
Are you serious?

487
00:50:21,085 --> 00:50:22,451
Yeah, I'm serious.

488
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:25,455
Oh.

489
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:29,126
I, uh...

490
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:31,795
I...

491
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:37,233
I just said that so you'd
take me with you.

492
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,504
All you had to do was ask.

493
00:50:41,506 --> 00:50:46,409
<i>I got to take my meds. I
got to take my meds. I got to take a half.</i>

494
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:51,047
<i>I got to take my meds. I got to
take my meds. I got to take a half.</i>

495
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:55,317
<i>No, I got to take a whole pill. I got
to take my meds. I got to take my meds.</i>

496
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:13,069
- So can I still use that ticket?
- Yeah, not that important.

497
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:15,504
So I don't need a ticket?

498
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:17,840
Not that paper ticket, anyway.

499
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:20,576
Besides, I have most important
trip tickets in the fridge.

500
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:25,448
Let me ask you something.

501
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:27,316
Shoot.

502
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:29,718
You don't see
that guy right there?

503
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,293
Interesting.

504
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:40,463
- You do?
- I do.

505
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:41,864
Ha!

506
00:51:41,866 --> 00:51:44,834
- Holy shit!
- Ah-ha!

507
00:52:07,692 --> 00:52:08,858
Fuck!

508
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:12,895
- I think I get it! I think I get it!
- What? What the fuck do you get?

509
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:15,498
- It makes sense.
- None of this makes any sense.

510
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,234
- Oh, it makes perfect sense.
- Tell me, Einstein.

511
00:52:18,236 --> 00:52:20,736
- Tell me what you have on this!
- That's exactly right.

512
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:22,771
Einstein couldn't get it,
but I think I did.

513
00:52:22,773 --> 00:52:25,641
- What are you fucking talking about?
- Multiverse.

514
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:27,643
Quantum Mechanics
versus Relativity.

515
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,645
Shut up and say something
that makes sense!

516
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:32,164
Okay, listen,
this is what you got to know.

517
00:52:32,165 --> 00:52:34,682
About a hundred years ago, Einstein
turned everything in physics on its ass

518
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:37,620
with his theory of relativity.
And that had to do with time and space,

519
00:52:37,622 --> 00:52:39,255
kind of being the same thing.

520
00:52:39,257 --> 00:52:41,857
<i>Space-time! Space-time!</i>

521
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:44,260
<i>Meanwhile, there were
these other physicists</i>

522
00:52:44,262 --> 00:52:46,829
<i>dealing with probability and working
at completely different math.</i>

523
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:49,498
<i>Like, radically different,
and logic as you know it</i>

524
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:52,084
<i>was just thrown out the window.</i>

525
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,669
<i>So much that Einstein himself
was plagued by the entire notion.</i>

526
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:57,173
<i>Anguished by how two
diametrically opposed theories</i>

527
00:52:57,175 --> 00:52:59,608
<i>about how the world
works could coexist.</i>

528
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:03,179
<i>Quantum, the world of the
small and our everyday reality.</i>

529
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:05,915
<i>Us, planets, etcetera.</i>

530
00:53:05,917 --> 00:53:08,317
<i>Gravity and space
and all that theorizing</i>

531
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:11,820
<i>led us to this strange,
troubling problem that exists today.</i>

532
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:15,824
<i>The laws of the small do not
connect up to the laws of the large.</i>

533
00:53:16,427 --> 00:53:21,830
And the small, the quantum theory,
has never, ever, been proven wrong.

534
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:25,301
So where does that leave us?

535
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:28,571
The mysterious Linchpin
of the whole Standard Model!

536
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:30,706
The standard particle itself
was just discovered,

537
00:53:31,342 --> 00:53:34,777
which brings us to super
symmetry versus the multiverse.

538
00:53:34,779 --> 00:53:38,380
- Oh, here we go again!
- No, quite the opposite.

539
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:41,167
On one side is
the multiverse concept.

540
00:53:41,168 --> 00:53:43,953
The Google the possible probable
outcomes of every little energy molecule.

541
00:53:43,955 --> 00:53:46,255
The Google of yous
and versions of your life,

542
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:48,857
theoretically live in totally
different realities.

543
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:52,361
Just the idea of self makes life
feel completely random and pointless.

544
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:55,231
Then, and here's
where it gets interesting.

545
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:57,266
It's already interesting enough!

546
00:53:57,268 --> 00:53:59,768
On the other side,
with super symmetry,

547
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:03,939
everything is in this almost
improbable inconceivable harmony.

548
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:05,874
A miracle of specificity.

549
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:09,478
A truly enlightening equilibrium
that only leads us to think

550
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,983
that the universe must be a
product of intelligent design: God!

551
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:19,755
- There is a god?
- That's hard to say.

552
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:23,459
Some people call the Higgs
boson particle God, yes.

553
00:54:23,461 --> 00:54:27,429
- So I am in Hell?
- Uh, maybe, but it's okay.

554
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,898
- I think I solved it.
- You solved it?

555
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,034
- The connection.
- Between what?

556
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:33,836
The quantum
and classical theories.

557
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:36,438
- You did?
- I did.

558
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:39,808
At least... I think I did.

559
00:54:40,645 --> 00:54:41,777
<i>I was wasted.</i>

560
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:46,282
<i>Using the new Higgs boson weight
to finish my senior equation.</i>

561
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:49,952
<i>And then I stood up and went
to the bathroom to take a dump.</i>

562
00:54:50,655 --> 00:54:53,555
Then, it hit me.

563
00:54:55,026 --> 00:54:56,725
- It hit you?
- Yeah.

564
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:59,395
- On the toilet?
- Yes.

565
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:05,634
What Einstein couldn't figure
out, you did while taking a dump?

566
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:24,887
Is that a periscope?

567
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:27,723
- Kind of.
- Did you make it yourself?

568
00:55:27,725 --> 00:55:28,757
Yeah, how'd you guess?

569
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:30,092
You got a little, uh...

570
00:55:31,796 --> 00:55:32,796
Mm.

571
00:55:34,065 --> 00:55:35,798
Anyway, when I was
on the toilet,

572
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,034
I remember feeling
this giant wave of energy

573
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:42,905
just rush through me
like a moment of uniformity.

574
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:45,541
I was everywhere in the same
place, like, the same time.

575
00:55:45,543 --> 00:55:47,509
<i>The whole universe
and I were one.</i>

576
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:50,746
I took a deep breath,
and then... and then imploded.

577
00:55:50,748 --> 00:55:53,515
<i>You imploded with the universe?</i>

578
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:54,957
<i>Yeah, like I had sex with her.</i>

579
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:58,454
You had sex with the universe?

580
00:55:58,456 --> 00:56:00,956
Yeah, see, the crazy thing is,

581
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:04,927
all we know only makes 5% of the
entire value of the universe.

582
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:09,398
Now, with the Higgs weight,
I can solve my senior equation,

583
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,834
which all comes down
to dark matter.

584
00:56:12,436 --> 00:56:15,070
- Is that, like, Darth Vader?
- Kind of.

585
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:17,539
And it's negative. Dark energy.

586
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:20,075
- Is that like the force?
- Yes! We don't know what they are.

587
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:22,811
The Higgs and weight of the God
Particle was the missing clue.

588
00:56:22,813 --> 00:56:24,980
Now, I'm using it
to calculate the probability

589
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:27,015
of the Big Crunch
or the Big Rip.

590
00:56:27,017 --> 00:56:28,384
Is that like gas?

591
00:56:28,386 --> 00:56:30,018
It's how the universe ends.

592
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:32,821
It's either a squish or a poof,

593
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:34,423
and I wrote it down and then...

594
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,028
Huh? I must've been right!

595
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:43,399
Why?

596
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,769
Because my calculation was an
observation that changed the outcome.

597
00:56:47,872 --> 00:56:50,105
Now, instead of being
in the center of the equilibrium

598
00:56:50,107 --> 00:56:52,574
between super symmetry
and the multiverse...

599
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:57,613
The worst possible
thing has happened.

600
00:56:57,615 --> 00:57:00,449
The multiverse itself
is entangled!

601
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:06,522
<i>The multiverse has entangled.</i>

602
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:07,790
Nice.

603
00:57:07,792 --> 00:57:11,493
Now, all I have to do
is figure out what he wants.

604
00:57:11,495 --> 00:57:14,496
Well, maybe we should
just ask him.

605
00:57:14,498 --> 00:57:18,500
- Huh.
- I mean, why are you driving away from him, exactly?

606
00:57:18,502 --> 00:57:21,103
I don't know. It just seemed
like the right thing to do.

607
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:26,208
I agree. I agree, it did seem like
the right thing to do at the time...

608
00:57:27,077 --> 00:57:30,712
but now
that it's this space-time,

609
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:33,949
maybe we should reconsider.

610
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:08,584
What are you thinking about?

611
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:10,752
I don't know.

612
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:14,623
What are you thinking about?

613
00:58:14,625 --> 00:58:17,559
I don't know.
I'm just so confused.

614
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:19,528
It's okay.
You're a General Studies major.

615
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:21,830
You guys don't know
anything about everything.

616
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,766
Fuck you, multi whatever!

617
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:26,768
Get us the fuck out
of this dimension!

618
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,670
No need to be ashamed.

619
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,571
Your brain picked the major it could
handle at its fullest capacity.

620
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:32,941
Everyone has their own paths.
Some are farmers, they're happy.

621
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:35,744
- Holy shit, he's back!
- He's back?

622
00:58:35,746 --> 00:58:39,681
There's just no getting rid of this guy.
Who the fuck is he?

623
00:58:41,252 --> 00:58:43,619
- Well, let's ask him.
- Sure,

624
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:45,821
let's get this over with,
for God's sakes.

625
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:49,525
Hey!

626
00:58:52,162 --> 00:58:54,263
Can we help you?

627
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:07,643
What do you want from us?

628
00:59:15,286 --> 00:59:16,618
Oh, fuck!

629
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:19,788
Fine, you can have him.

630
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:22,224
- Oh, fuck no!
- Oh, yes.

631
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:25,561
- Oh, no! Hell no!
- What's he gonna do to you?

632
00:59:25,563 --> 00:59:26,995
Rape your brain?

633
00:59:26,997 --> 00:59:30,098
- Probably!
- And is that a bad thing?

634
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,135
It sounds a lot better than what
we're currently going through here!

635
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:41,710
What do you want with me?

636
00:59:50,621 --> 00:59:52,154
He wants your head!

637
00:59:52,156 --> 00:59:54,022
- He's not getting my head.
- Why not?

638
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:55,591
'Cause it's my head, not yours!

639
00:59:56,694 --> 00:59:58,126
Okay, okay.

640
01:00:00,965 --> 01:00:04,833
What do you need

641
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:08,036
his head for?

642
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:25,120
To solve the problem.

643
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,659
He speaks.

644
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,028
See?

645
01:00:33,864 --> 01:00:35,697
See? It wasn't so bad.

646
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:40,636
Shit.

647
01:00:40,638 --> 01:00:41,670
What?

648
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:43,105
What, shit?

649
01:00:46,176 --> 01:00:48,744
What's wrong?
You solved it already, right?

650
01:00:48,746 --> 01:00:50,245
We just need to give it to him.

651
01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:54,783
I can't.

652
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:58,120
What? Why? Why can't you?

653
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:02,658
- It's gone.
- What do you mean, it's gone?

654
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:07,262
- I threw it away.
- No, I thought you had some blowjob with the universe.

655
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:08,664
Where did it go?

656
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:11,266
I... I wrote it.

657
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:12,668
Yeah?

658
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:15,037
I...

659
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:19,074
Oh, no. Oh, no!

660
01:01:19,977 --> 01:01:21,743
You didn't?

661
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:23,078
I did.

662
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:26,448
- You didn't do that.
- Yeah.

663
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:29,885
You wiped your ass with the answer to the
greatest question in the human history.

664
01:01:29,887 --> 01:01:32,320
I did do that.

665
01:01:33,424 --> 01:01:36,758
Jesus Christ, man! No wonder
everything's gone to hell

666
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,960
in a hand basket.
God's fucking pissed.

667
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:40,696
I think so. I had no idea!

668
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:42,698
- You had no idea?
- I had no idea!

669
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:45,200
All you had to do was ask.

670
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,836
- Oh, my God, he's got a gun!
- No!

671
01:01:51,975 --> 01:01:54,342
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.
- What are you doing?

672
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:58,013
- You can't escape him. He's everywhere.
- Oh, God.

673
01:01:58,015 --> 01:02:00,449
- Oh, God.
- Maybe he's our counselor.

674
01:02:00,451 --> 01:02:02,718
I mean, he is like God.

675
01:02:04,288 --> 01:02:08,356
- I really think he's God.
- God doesn't need me to solve the world's problems.

676
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:11,026
He already solved his by creating
this universe and not being in it.

677
01:02:11,028 --> 01:02:13,095
He just gets to observe.

678
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:15,931
- Whatever, just drive.
- Okay, okay.

679
01:02:16,734 --> 01:02:19,768
Hey, that actually makes sense.

680
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:22,204
Did God abandon me

681
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:24,773
or did I abandon him?

682
01:02:25,509 --> 01:02:31,747
Life is some, like, rigged
metaphysical SAT test

683
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:33,749
with unfair questions.

684
01:02:35,986 --> 01:02:37,486
I failed.

685
01:02:39,022 --> 01:02:42,190
I mean, I won
the genetic lottery, man.

686
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:44,893
My parents love me
in their own way.

687
01:02:46,063 --> 01:02:48,463
I didn't go hungry
or long for anything.

688
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,901
I was actually pretty spoiled,
to tell you the truth.

689
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:57,372
They weren't Catholic, but they
sent me to Catholic School

690
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:59,307
so I could get a good education.

691
01:03:00,144 --> 01:03:01,543
And what happened?

692
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:08,383
I hated it.
I hated them... and God.

693
01:03:10,888 --> 01:03:13,455
I mean, I didn't see any proof.
I saw the opposite.

694
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:16,224
Dirty men looking up skirts.

695
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:22,798
Sex Ed was about how to abstain,
not science.

696
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:26,268
Fucking hypocrites!

697
01:03:27,437 --> 01:03:28,870
But...

698
01:03:31,074 --> 01:03:33,008
if there really is a god...

699
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:39,181
then his particle, it's, like,

700
01:03:39,183 --> 01:03:41,149
the bonus question for mankind,

701
01:03:41,852 --> 01:03:44,386
and your revelation from him...

702
01:03:45,189 --> 01:03:47,455
is a gift from him.

703
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:49,958
To flush that shit down
the toilet?

704
01:03:50,928 --> 01:03:53,128
You might as well have just
flipped God the bird.

705
01:03:56,033 --> 01:03:59,000
It's, like,
Noah and the Arc now.

706
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:02,170
He's just rebooting mankind.

707
01:04:02,973 --> 01:04:04,372
Think, Toby, think.

708
01:04:04,374 --> 01:04:08,877
Yeah, think!
Think. Take your time.

709
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:12,314
Take your... wait for it!

710
01:04:12,316 --> 01:04:15,450
Space-time!

711
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:18,453
- I crack myself up.
- Glad you're so amused.

712
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:22,224
God works
in mysterious ways, man.

713
01:04:24,261 --> 01:04:25,594
Where is this counselor?

714
01:04:25,596 --> 01:04:26,895
You'll see yours...

715
01:04:30,234 --> 01:04:31,474
when you're meant to see yours.

716
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:34,603
Do you remember how we met?

717
01:04:35,305 --> 01:04:38,139
I have no idea who you are

718
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:39,875
or where you came from.

719
01:04:40,644 --> 01:04:43,044
The last thing I remember
is Halloween

720
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:45,580
and doing shots at the Bluewhale

721
01:04:45,582 --> 01:04:48,550
for their Bottomless
Tuesday Costume Game Night.

722
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:52,120
So that's not what you
wear all the time?

723
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:54,956
Is that what you wear
all the time?

724
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:56,391
Don't answer that.

725
01:04:57,661 --> 01:05:00,262
- It's only Saturday.
- That's entirely possible.

726
01:05:00,264 --> 01:05:04,432
I could've OD'd. For all
you know, I could be an angel.

727
01:05:04,434 --> 01:05:06,134
Absolutely not.

728
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:10,171
Or a fantasy
of your OCD imagination.

729
01:05:10,173 --> 01:05:13,308
Unlikely. I have OCD,
not schizophrenia.

730
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,243
Makes it hard
to have friends, honestly.

731
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,112
Hey, let's make a calendar

732
01:05:17,114 --> 01:05:19,114
of everything
that's happened so far.

733
01:05:19,483 --> 01:05:20,582
Write it out, would you?

734
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:28,390
<i>Everything in physics for the last
hundred years was coming down to Tuesday.</i>

735
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:31,927
<i>The biggest experiment in human history.
The CERN particle collider</i>

736
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:35,263
<i>announced the weight of the missing clue
to the Standard Model of quantum mechanics,</i>

737
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:39,434
<i>the Higgs boson.
The God Particle itself.</i>

738
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,403
<i>That night, physicists
around the world learned</i>

739
01:05:41,405 --> 01:05:43,438
<i>what could be the bridge
between classical physics,</i>

740
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,573
Einstein, and quantum mechanics.

741
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:48,176
It meant I could finish
my senior thesis,

742
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:50,211
"The Theory of Everything."

743
01:05:50,213 --> 01:05:53,114
<i>It was right there
at the worst spot: 125.09</i>

744
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:59,287
<i>plus minus 0.24GeV/c2</i>

745
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:04,359
<i>and I thought that weight could
leave every answer still in question.</i>

746
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,228
I started
the equation right away.

747
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:11,399
<i>Worked straight through.</i>

748
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:15,170
<i>And I could hear people
starting to party for Halloween.</i>

749
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:18,473
<i>I couldn't get invited
anywhere, so...</i>

750
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:21,543
<i>I remember I broke open the skull
vodka my dad shipped me from home</i>

751
01:06:21,545 --> 01:06:23,812
<i>and kept on working.</i>

752
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:26,080
- Skull vodka?
- Yeah, my dad's a physicist too,

753
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:30,285
he knew that the announcement could
mean that I could solve the equation.

754
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:46,634
- I opened it early.
- I would have too.

755
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:48,437
Really?

756
01:06:51,308 --> 01:06:56,711
<i>Anyway, I kept drinking shots.
Blacked out.</i>

757
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:01,149
<i>Next thing I remember, there's
someone breaking into my room,</i>

758
01:07:02,052 --> 01:07:04,452
<i>and it's a hot girl.</i>

759
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:06,287
Well, thank you.

760
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:09,057
You're welcome.
It's never happened for me.

761
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:13,528
- What? You mean you're a...
- You don't have to say it.

762
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,531
Are you trying to tell me
that I took your virginity?

763
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:19,567
Maybe. I don't remember, anyway.
It doesn't matter.

764
01:07:19,569 --> 01:07:23,138
<i>We're making out, and I realized
I still have to go number two,</i>

765
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:27,509
<i>and, you know, I...
It was there on the toilet.</i>

766
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:31,613
And it was seeing your face...

767
01:07:31,615 --> 01:07:35,784
<i>like an angel, and the event
horizon was in your eyes,</i>

768
01:07:35,786 --> 01:07:38,420
<i>and singularity
came up within me.</i>

769
01:07:38,422 --> 01:07:41,056
And I was just fucked
by enlightenment.

770
01:07:41,591 --> 01:07:45,060
<i>I finished, and I wrote it down.</i>

771
01:07:46,329 --> 01:07:50,265
<i>And ran out of toilet paper
and I had to wipe,</i>

772
01:07:50,267 --> 01:07:51,800
<i>so, um...</i>

773
01:07:55,272 --> 01:07:59,841
and I flushed. There was
just this big bang suck...

774
01:08:01,645 --> 01:08:07,348
<i>but it went down the toilet,
and it spiraled and swirled.</i>

775
01:08:08,118 --> 01:08:11,619
My observational shit
changed the outcome.

776
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:13,688
<i>The future affects the past.</i>

777
01:08:16,126 --> 01:08:19,527
I must've opened portals
all over the place!

778
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:22,397
Toilet wormholes everywhere!

779
01:08:23,233 --> 01:08:25,467
<i>New rules of physics.</i>

780
01:08:25,469 --> 01:08:27,335
If you go around that corner,

781
01:08:27,337 --> 01:08:30,238
we may not be
in the same dimension anymore.

782
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,775
Halloween was the end
of the world as we know it.

783
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:37,545
Total chaos. Mass hysteria.

784
01:08:37,547 --> 01:08:41,116
Apocalypse.
Dogs and cats living together.

785
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:44,219
Everyone stepping
in and out of dimensions.

786
01:08:44,221 --> 01:08:47,188
Every door, every turn
could be a dimension.

787
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:49,757
Society completely collapsed!

788
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:53,661
Do you have anything to eat?

789
01:08:53,663 --> 01:08:55,630
Of course.
Check the mini fridge.

790
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,335
Okay, so what you're trying
to tell me is that you

791
01:09:00,337 --> 01:09:02,670
solving that stupid
equation entangled

792
01:09:02,672 --> 01:09:04,239
the multiverse?

793
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:16,851
Ah, salvia! That's why they
delivered all that beer.

794
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:20,722
<i>- Beer? I like beer.
- They evacuated the planet.</i>

795
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:24,325
I still don't get
who evacuated the planet.

796
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:27,662
Of course. Who else?

797
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:32,367
I mean, evacuated.
It's a strong word.

798
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:34,402
Everyone just got uploaded.

799
01:09:37,807 --> 01:09:40,808
<i>- Uploaded?
- To the cloud.</i>

800
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:44,245
The cloud? You mean the sky?

801
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:47,282
Yeah, the sky.

802
01:09:47,284 --> 01:09:48,883
By God?

803
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:50,385
He's an agent.

804
01:09:50,387 --> 01:09:51,819
I told you he was God.

805
01:09:51,821 --> 01:09:53,621
He's with AmasNoogle.

806
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:56,191
Oh, I like AmasNoogle!

807
01:09:56,193 --> 01:09:59,194
<i>I get my shoes on there
and my makeup and my movies</i>

808
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:02,764
- and my homework.
- I mean, it's pretty simple.

809
01:10:02,766 --> 01:10:07,402
So simple. You just click, and
a purse is there the next day.

810
01:10:07,404 --> 01:10:09,571
It's so fast, so cheap.

811
01:10:09,573 --> 01:10:10,905
Shit.

812
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:18,346
<i>AmasNoogle tricked me.
They sent an agent to get</i>

813
01:10:18,348 --> 01:10:20,348
<i>my equation
because it's the bridge.</i>

814
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:22,984
The bridge to their global cyber
consciousness.

815
01:10:22,986 --> 01:10:26,521
AI and to protect the world
from total collapse,

816
01:10:26,523 --> 01:10:30,291
AmasNoogle probably saved everyone
to the cloud big data style until...

817
01:10:30,293 --> 01:10:32,827
- Until what?
- Until AmasNoogle can figure out

818
01:10:32,829 --> 01:10:35,663
what the fuck to do to protect
its revenue, obviously.

819
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:37,765
- How do they solve it?
- They can't,

820
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:39,801
not without imploding
the bridge in the code,

821
01:10:39,803 --> 01:10:42,637
which is my equation.
AmasNoogle isn't a person.

822
01:10:42,639 --> 01:10:46,441
It's just a computer now.
And only life and blood

823
01:10:46,443 --> 01:10:49,010
can experience
transcendent enlightenment.

824
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:53,281
Only we know
what spiritual truth is.

825
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:58,820
The disconnect is between their
digital consciousness algorithm

826
01:10:58,822 --> 01:11:00,788
and my organic moment
of enlightenment.

827
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:02,857
So what do we have to do?

828
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:06,494
What we have to do is undo

829
01:11:06,496 --> 01:11:07,929
the damage of my flush.

830
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:09,864
Upload the equation,

831
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:12,834
fill the gap in information,
and<i> voilà</i>.

832
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,903
- The equation you wiped your ass with?
- Yeah.

833
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:16,905
Awesome.

834
01:11:18,575 --> 01:11:20,675
Are we still going
to the launch pad?

835
01:11:20,677 --> 01:11:22,510
No, there's nobody there.

836
01:11:23,546 --> 01:11:24,846
It's okay. I just have to think.

837
01:11:29,519 --> 01:11:32,387
Uh, what you doing?

838
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:37,325
It just helps me think.

839
01:11:38,762 --> 01:11:41,496
- That little skateboard?
- Fingerboard.

840
01:11:41,498 --> 01:11:43,031
They say it's good
for scientists

841
01:11:43,033 --> 01:11:45,333
and businesspeople
to calm the nerves.

842
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:47,802
Mkay.

843
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,814
Um... I really hate
to be a bother here

844
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:02,784
but is that really necessary?

845
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:05,988
Yeah.

846
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:08,456
Okay, just checking.

847
01:12:12,062 --> 01:12:16,531
- He's still following us.
- I think he's waiting for me to solve the equation again.

848
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:18,733
Uh... Do you have a plan?

849
01:12:19,369 --> 01:12:20,668
Um...

850
01:12:21,371 --> 01:12:24,439
Okay, 'cause you did say
at one point

851
01:12:24,441 --> 01:12:25,807
that you had a plan...

852
01:12:25,809 --> 01:12:27,742
Yeah, - ...for everything.

853
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:30,111
I... I'm formulating.
There's... there've been a lot

854
01:12:30,113 --> 01:12:32,747
- of interesting developments.
- Yes, surely.

855
01:12:32,749 --> 01:12:35,083
I mean,
I don't mean to be tacky,

856
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:38,920
but we are, you know,
the last people on the planet,

857
01:12:38,922 --> 01:12:40,355
so there's that!

858
01:12:42,492 --> 01:12:44,492
Holy shit!

859
01:12:44,494 --> 01:12:46,894
- Holy shit, what?
- You are a genius!

860
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:48,930
- What'd I do?
- I mean, I am after realizing

861
01:12:48,932 --> 01:12:50,631
the value of what you just said.

862
01:12:50,633 --> 01:12:53,768
You're a genius? You're special.

863
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:56,871
You said
you don't want to be tacky,

864
01:12:56,873 --> 01:13:00,608
but we're the last people
on the planet, so...

865
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:05,079
Look, I am in no way shape or
form having sex with you again.

866
01:13:05,081 --> 01:13:08,116
Not in this lifetime.
Not in this reality.

867
01:13:08,118 --> 01:13:12,653
Not in your reality or in his or in any of
those other fucking mes and yous out there

868
01:13:12,655 --> 01:13:14,989
thinking
about probabilistic bullshit.

869
01:13:14,991 --> 01:13:17,392
No, tachyons.
The hypothetical particles

870
01:13:17,394 --> 01:13:19,727
that travel faster
than the speed of light,

871
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,562
which nothing
technically can do.

872
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:24,532
I am once in my life
not thinking about sex.

873
01:13:24,534 --> 01:13:28,102
It might have happened in the
past, but it's not happening again.

874
01:13:28,104 --> 01:13:30,705
- Mm, yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

875
01:13:30,707 --> 01:13:33,741
I mean it really is if I can
get us to that dimension.

876
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:36,411
- No, it's not.
- You're not getting it.

877
01:13:36,413 --> 01:13:39,580
- We have to go back.
- What?

878
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:41,916
We have to go back.

879
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,117
Go back where?

880
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:46,087
Go back... go back in...

881
01:13:46,089 --> 01:13:48,723
- In what?
- Space-time!

882
01:13:56,866 --> 01:14:00,935
And how, pray tell,
do you expect us to do that?

883
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:04,739
Simple. Tachyons exist in a dimension
on the other side of the speed of light

884
01:14:04,741 --> 01:14:07,975
at such a high energy level
that they can travel backwards

885
01:14:07,977 --> 01:14:11,479
through time.
So, hypothetically,

886
01:14:11,481 --> 01:14:14,182
we just need enough energy
to step through a wormhole

887
01:14:14,184 --> 01:14:17,785
without being ripped apart
by gravitational forces.

888
01:14:26,596 --> 01:14:28,529
Gah, for God's sakes!

889
01:14:28,531 --> 01:14:31,032
Are you trying to tell me
Suunnee's a time machine?

890
01:14:31,034 --> 01:14:34,101
- Not a time machine.
- Not a time machine?

891
01:14:34,103 --> 01:14:37,104
Not a time machine
but a space-time sling.

892
01:14:39,542 --> 01:14:42,543
Yes, exactly,
'cause I was really hoping

893
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:44,979
you weren't taking me back
to the past in a DeLorean.

894
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:48,616
I'd rather a souped-up
muscle car that currently

895
01:14:48,618 --> 01:14:50,885
has a mini fridge
jammed up at my vajayjay,

896
01:14:50,887 --> 01:14:53,621
a sex floaty, and a surfboard...
on the roof!

897
01:14:53,623 --> 01:14:55,623
You know,
I'm trying to solve this here...

898
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,959
and you're being antagonistic.

899
01:14:57,961 --> 01:15:00,528
Can you grab us a few drinks out
of the fridge, please?

900
01:15:02,565 --> 01:15:05,633
No, no, no, not those. Those.

901
01:15:05,635 --> 01:15:07,268
I made those myself.

902
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:09,537
I'm just trying
to live in reality.

903
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:12,573
- Ah, there's your problem.
- I give up. Bring the agent

904
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:14,709
back, please.
Can I go ride with him?

905
01:15:14,711 --> 01:15:16,844
- Technically, no.
- Why not?

906
01:15:17,814 --> 01:15:20,047
Because he's straddling
the organic in digital system.

907
01:15:20,049 --> 01:15:22,650
If he wants it to be solved,
he's gonna have me do it

908
01:15:22,652 --> 01:15:25,686
in my organic space.
In my loaf of bread.

909
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:29,924
You see now that
these dimensions overlap.

910
01:15:29,926 --> 01:15:32,994
Only we are still in line
within my super symmetry dump,

911
01:15:32,996 --> 01:15:35,930
and if he does anything
to us now,

912
01:15:35,932 --> 01:15:40,635
he may alter the potential to
undo what's been done then there.

913
01:15:41,571 --> 01:15:43,237
Is that a turtle?

914
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:47,208
This is Tank,
my California desert tortoise.

915
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:50,077
He's currently 85 years old.

916
01:15:50,914 --> 01:15:54,215
He's been hibernating, so
he's gonna be a little groggy.

917
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:57,151
No food, no water for months.

918
01:15:59,756 --> 01:16:02,223
He hasn't gone to the bathroom
since first semester.

919
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:05,793
I rescued him when they developed
the desert with wind turbines.

920
01:16:06,696 --> 01:16:09,297
See, with everything,
there's a plus and a minus.

921
01:16:09,299 --> 01:16:12,833
There's no living organism
more adept at storing energy,

922
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:16,037
and we're gonna need
a lot of it.

923
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:19,574
Physics, my dear friend,
is about interlocking forces.

924
01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:21,876
Dark energy has dark matter.

925
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:24,912
Suunnee has Tank.

926
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:27,949
We can use opposing forces.
Nature and machine

927
01:16:27,951 --> 01:16:31,085
to slingshot us
through space-time.

928
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:33,955
- You're feeling better.
- Yes.

929
01:16:33,957 --> 01:16:36,591
Me too. This makes sense.

930
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:38,092
So what's next?

931
01:16:38,795 --> 01:16:40,127
Hello, Tank.

932
01:16:40,129 --> 01:16:41,963
- We go back.
- Yes.

933
01:16:41,965 --> 01:16:45,833
Let's... wait,
I'm so sorry. I missed that.

934
01:16:45,835 --> 01:16:48,636
- How do we do that again?
- Like this.

935
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:15,931
Aah.

936
01:17:19,369 --> 01:17:23,304
Whoa! Dude,
you're freaking me out.

937
01:17:24,941 --> 01:17:28,342
Oh, dude, don't do this.
Don't freak me out anymore.

938
01:17:28,344 --> 01:17:30,111
I swear, I'll go back to church.

939
01:17:30,113 --> 01:17:32,213
No, no, it's okay.

940
01:17:32,215 --> 01:17:34,749
Just close your eyes too
and drink your beer.

941
01:17:34,751 --> 01:17:38,252
We have to do it together
to achieve our super symmetry.

942
01:17:38,254 --> 01:17:41,255
No, you're fucking nuts, man!

943
01:17:41,257 --> 01:17:43,691
I'm not gonna close
my goddamn eyes

944
01:17:43,693 --> 01:17:46,227
while we're driving 60 miles
an hour down the highway

945
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:48,829
with a turtle
on the dashboard in reverse!

946
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:50,231
Tank is a tortoise.

947
01:17:50,933 --> 01:17:52,266
Huge difference.

948
01:17:52,268 --> 01:17:53,701
Turtle, tortoise.

949
01:17:53,703 --> 01:17:55,169
I'm not doing it.

950
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:57,138
Fine, stay here.
Break the universe.

951
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:59,407
- No big deal.
- Oh, don't! Don't you dare

952
01:17:59,409 --> 01:18:02,009
mind fuck my Catholic guilt!

953
01:18:02,812 --> 01:18:07,281
No, actually, we need you
to just clear your mind

954
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:12,453
and channel my moment
of enlightenment and let go.

955
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:25,793
- Oh... shit!
- Keep them closed. It's beginning to happen.

956
01:19:26,863 --> 01:19:29,296
Oh... shit!

957
01:19:29,298 --> 01:19:31,165
Just keep them closed!

958
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:33,200
No matter what happens!

959
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:35,836
Keep them closed.

960
01:19:36,873 --> 01:19:38,439
Oh, fuck.

961
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:40,407
Closed.

962
01:19:44,814 --> 01:19:49,950
- Oh!
- Oh, shit!

963
01:19:59,362 --> 01:20:01,328
Oh, fuck!

964
01:20:21,417 --> 01:20:24,084
<i>- Hello?
- Yes?</i>

965
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:27,154
<i>- Damn it.
- What's wrong?</i>

966
01:20:27,957 --> 01:20:29,390
<i>I thought you'd be gone.</i>

967
01:20:30,426 --> 01:20:34,128
<i>- So what happened?
- Singularity.</i>

968
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:36,530
<i>Yeah, but where are we?</i>

969
01:20:36,532 --> 01:20:40,301
<i>The question
is not where but when, where?</i>

970
01:20:40,303 --> 01:20:43,604
<i>Dude,
I'm seriously not in the mood</i>

971
01:20:43,606 --> 01:20:46,273
<i>- for this shit anymore.
- Just give it a second.</i>

972
01:20:46,275 --> 01:20:49,109
<i>- I'm just almost done.
- What? With what?</i>

973
01:20:52,281 --> 01:20:54,148
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

974
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:57,551
<i>- What the fuck? Oh, my God!
- I'm sorry.</i>

975
01:20:57,553 --> 01:21:00,521
<i>- Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus!
- I know, I'm sorry.</i>

976
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:02,223
<i>Are you kidding me right now?</i>

977
01:21:07,964 --> 01:21:09,430
I just can't!

978
01:21:09,432 --> 01:21:11,265
It was the only way.

979
01:21:11,267 --> 01:21:13,634
I just don't know why
this is happening to me.

980
01:21:13,636 --> 01:21:15,469
This is when it happened.

981
01:21:15,471 --> 01:21:17,238
Are you sure?

982
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,373
I don't feel any,
like, universe-gasm

983
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:23,210
crawling up in this...
this shit, literally.

984
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:25,512
I just need you to stop,
for a little bit.

985
01:21:25,514 --> 01:21:29,283
Let me do this. I was dreaming,
and I was thinking,

986
01:21:29,986 --> 01:21:33,954
and... it hit me.
And I wrote on the toilet paper.

987
01:21:33,956 --> 01:21:36,257
Because people do that.
They keep pens in the bathroom

988
01:21:36,259 --> 01:21:38,559
and solve quadratic equations
while sitting on the throne.

989
01:21:40,263 --> 01:21:42,930
Bathrooms are considered sacred
by the Greek philosophers

990
01:21:42,932 --> 01:21:45,099
and used for deep connections
with one's brain.

991
01:21:45,101 --> 01:21:48,535
While relaxing for hours
are my best thinking on the pot.

992
01:21:48,537 --> 01:21:50,905
Well, let me not stop
Mother Nature.

993
01:21:50,907 --> 01:21:54,108
Yeah, let's give it
an old faith, shall we?

994
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:56,277
Oh, I want to have faith!

995
01:21:56,279 --> 01:21:58,112
For the first time
in my goddamn life,

996
01:21:58,114 --> 01:21:59,580
I can honestly say that...

997
01:22:00,283 --> 01:22:02,683
Wait, what are you doing?

998
01:22:02,685 --> 01:22:04,919
- I'm writing.
- You're what?

999
01:22:04,921 --> 01:22:08,155
- I rap.
- You're rapping now?

1000
01:22:08,157 --> 01:22:10,591
Yeah, I'm writing. I'm feeling lit.
Freestyle. It helps me think.

1001
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:13,627
- You're feeling it?
- Yeah. It's coming.

1002
01:22:13,629 --> 01:22:15,629
What is?

1003
01:22:35,151 --> 01:22:37,284
No, no! No, it's not working.

1004
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:39,954
No...

1005
01:22:41,991 --> 01:22:45,159
Oh. Oh, my God.

1006
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:11,185
No, no, no!

1007
01:23:20,396 --> 01:23:24,665
Creativity itself is
an intersection of dimensions.

1008
01:24:38,841 --> 01:24:41,708
- Did you get it?
- I got it. I got it!

1009
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:43,277
Write it down, quickly!

1010
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:45,846
I got it. Just give me a minute.

1011
01:24:47,283 --> 01:24:48,382
Take all the time you need.

1012
01:24:49,318 --> 01:24:51,218
Just don't use it to...

1013
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:53,387
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know.

1014
01:24:58,194 --> 01:25:02,496
- Is that it? Oh.
- That's it.

1015
01:25:02,498 --> 01:25:05,332
Oh, God, I love it. Oh!

1016
01:25:06,202 --> 01:25:08,168
Let's not talk
about God right now.

1017
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:10,637
Sure, whatever you want,
big boy. Whatever you want.

1018
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:13,140
You're my big boy, aren't you?

1019
01:25:13,142 --> 01:25:16,510
- Oh, yeah.
- I am? Really?

1020
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:20,781
No. I mean yes.

1021
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:24,384
Just stay focused. Just write.

1022
01:25:24,386 --> 01:25:27,387
Okay, okay, sure. Uh-oh. Oh.

1023
01:25:29,558 --> 01:25:33,160
- Are you... you okay?
- Uh, oh, no.

1024
01:25:33,162 --> 01:25:35,629
- You still got it?
- Oh, God.

1025
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:39,133
- No.
- Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no.

1026
01:25:39,135 --> 01:25:42,369
- No! No! No! No! No! No!
- No, no, no, no, no.

1027
01:25:42,371 --> 01:25:47,774
- Oh, God, oh, God,
- oh, God! Fucking God!

1028
01:25:47,776 --> 01:25:51,145
Oh, gee, ah! It's gone.

1029
01:25:53,782 --> 01:25:55,849
I shouldn't have this on.

1030
01:26:09,465 --> 01:26:11,565
Happy Halloween.
Happy Halloween.

1031
01:26:11,567 --> 01:26:13,233
Happy Halloween.

1032
01:26:19,775 --> 01:26:21,508
<i>Where is this counselor?</i>

1033
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:23,410
<i>You see yours</i>

1034
01:26:23,412 --> 01:26:25,212
<i>when you're meant to see yours.</i>

1035
01:26:26,749 --> 01:26:29,683
<i>It's believed to be an
incarnation of the Virgin Mary.</i>

1036
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:35,455
I mean, it's not my fault!
I was made this way, God!

1037
01:26:35,457 --> 01:26:40,460
Did God abandon me?
Or did I abandon him?

1038
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:45,265
<i>Salvia.</i>

1039
01:26:45,267 --> 01:26:51,238
<i>Time is an illusion. Mazatec shamans
use it for religious purposes.</i>

1040
01:26:52,608 --> 01:26:55,442
You came through
the wormhole with me.

1041
01:27:06,488 --> 01:27:10,791
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy Name.

1042
01:27:10,793 --> 01:27:13,961
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

1043
01:27:13,963 --> 01:27:16,463
on Earth as it is in heaven.

1044
01:27:17,533 --> 01:27:20,234
Give us this day
our daily bread.

1045
01:27:22,271 --> 01:27:24,671
And forgive us our trespasses,

1046
01:27:24,673 --> 01:27:28,542
as we forgive those who have
trespassed against us.

1047
01:27:28,544 --> 01:27:31,878
And lead us not into temptation...

1048
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:36,283
But deliver us from evil.

1049
01:27:36,285 --> 01:27:39,686
For thine is the kingdom

1050
01:27:39,688 --> 01:27:43,724
and the power...

1051
01:27:43,726 --> 01:27:46,593
And the glory!

1052
01:27:47,463 --> 01:27:51,898
Now and forever and ever!

1053
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:55,535
It's back! It's good.
I got it. Yeah.

1054
01:27:56,772 --> 01:28:00,440
Holy shit. It worked.

1055
01:28:02,978 --> 01:28:05,279
I get it.

1056
01:28:05,281 --> 01:28:08,715
And you're the proof,
and that toilet paper

1057
01:28:08,717 --> 01:28:12,319
is like the Shroud of Turin.
Wait, if that makes you, like,

1058
01:28:12,321 --> 01:28:14,721
the Messiah,
then does that make me...

1059
01:28:16,058 --> 01:28:18,558
Wow. Fuck!

1060
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:24,364
You know, and they say she
wasn't a virgin at all, either.

1061
01:28:24,366 --> 01:28:27,434
I'm sorry. It's just my penis.

1062
01:28:27,870 --> 01:28:30,570
You know, when I have to think,
I have to think with both heads,

1063
01:28:30,572 --> 01:28:32,439
and what you said
distracted me with your...

1064
01:28:32,441 --> 01:28:33,940
Wait, no, wait.

1065
01:28:33,942 --> 01:28:36,076
Just you don't, don't, don't.

1066
01:28:37,379 --> 01:28:39,713
- Just stay focused and write.
- Okay, okay, yeah, yeah.

1067
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:45,686
Hey.

1068
01:28:47,890 --> 01:28:50,457
- He's back.
- He is?

1069
01:28:50,459 --> 01:28:53,927
Yeah, he's here. He's just waiting.
You know, for the equation.

1070
01:28:53,929 --> 01:28:56,363
I just thought
I should let you know.

1071
01:28:56,365 --> 01:28:57,631
- Stay focused.
- Okay, I know.

1072
01:29:02,871 --> 01:29:05,505
He's good. He's got it.

1073
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:07,341
Nothing to worry about.

1074
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:10,377
Looks like
it's all gonna be okay.

1075
01:29:19,755 --> 01:29:21,355
Do I know you?

1076
01:29:22,558 --> 01:29:24,391
You remind me of somebody.

1077
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:26,660
Oh, shit.

1078
01:29:28,397 --> 01:29:31,064
Yep, that's it.

1079
01:29:32,568 --> 01:29:34,634
I mean,
I had such a thing for him.

1080
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:39,906
He was my 9th grade
New Testament teacher.

1081
01:29:39,908 --> 01:29:41,375
Father Daniel.

1082
01:29:41,977 --> 01:29:46,046
He'd read psalms about our sins,

1083
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:48,582
and then he'd tell me
to stay after class...

1084
01:29:49,651 --> 01:29:51,084
in my uniform.

1085
01:29:52,054 --> 01:29:56,022
I would just get so...

1086
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:04,097
You know, if I were in another
dimension right now, I...

1087
01:30:04,099 --> 01:30:05,432
This is it!

1088
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:08,001
- This is it?
- Yep.

1089
01:30:08,003 --> 01:30:10,904
- I'm so glad that all worked out.
- Me too.

1090
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:13,073
- What a ride.
- Well?

1091
01:30:14,476 --> 01:30:16,977
So we just give this
to you now, right?

1092
01:30:49,845 --> 01:30:53,680
Is this the answer you're
looking for, headmaster?

1093
01:30:54,516 --> 01:30:56,850
Wait, did I miss something?

1094
01:30:56,852 --> 01:30:59,719
Huh? No. No, nothing.

1095
01:30:59,721 --> 01:31:02,856
- Why?
- You're, like, flirting with him.

1096
01:31:02,858 --> 01:31:05,459
- No.
- Are you into him?

1097
01:31:05,928 --> 01:31:07,727
What? No!

1098
01:31:09,832 --> 01:31:13,800
- Yeah.
- No.

1099
01:31:13,802 --> 01:31:15,035
- Yeah.
- No!

1100
01:31:15,037 --> 01:31:17,003
- Uh-huh. Yes.
- No!

1101
01:31:17,005 --> 01:31:19,673
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- No.

1102
01:31:19,675 --> 01:31:21,875
- Yeah.
- I'm really not. No, I'm not.

1103
01:31:21,877 --> 01:31:24,177
- No, you're wrong.
- Yes!

1104
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:25,980
No.

1105
01:31:26,849 --> 01:31:27,948
Yes.

1106
01:31:27,950 --> 01:31:28,950
No.

1107
01:31:29,718 --> 01:31:31,084
- Yep.
- No!

1108
01:31:31,086 --> 01:31:32,619
- Uh-huh.
- No!

1109
01:31:32,621 --> 01:31:34,054
- Yes!
- No!

1110
01:31:34,056 --> 01:31:36,957
- Yep!
- No!

1111
01:31:36,959 --> 01:31:42,529
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1112
01:31:42,531 --> 01:31:45,232
I mean, maybe. Why?

1113
01:31:45,234 --> 01:31:48,034
Really? Why?

1114
01:31:48,036 --> 01:31:50,570
'Cause we just...

1115
01:31:50,572 --> 01:31:52,272
We just, what?

1116
01:31:52,274 --> 01:31:54,274
We just we're, like...

1117
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:56,776
What?

1118
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:02,549
I mean, you know,
it was holy, like, wow.

1119
01:32:02,551 --> 01:32:04,684
Holy, like, wow?

1120
01:32:04,686 --> 01:32:07,153
- For me.
- Yeah, exactly.

1121
01:32:07,155 --> 01:32:10,290
Oh, wait.
We didn't sleep together yet.

1122
01:32:10,292 --> 01:32:14,828
- We didn't?
- No. The broken condom isn't there.

1123
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:17,063
Oh, my God. Thank you.

1124
01:32:17,065 --> 01:32:18,965
Thank you, Lord!

1125
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:28,041
Wow.

1126
01:32:29,278 --> 01:32:32,812
- Hello?

Can you let go off my balls?

1148

Balls please.

1149
01:39:58,393 --> 01:40:01,227
Balls, balls, balls please.

1150
01:40:01,229 --> 01:40:03,296
- Correct?
- Yeah.

1151
01:40:03,665 --> 01:40:07,533
Can you let go
off my balls, please?

1152
01:40:07,535 --> 01:40:09,135
The balls sounds not right.

1153
01:40:09,771 --> 01:40:11,537
Can you let go
off my balls, please?

1154
01:40:11,539 --> 01:40:13,306

01:40:32,127 --> 01:40:33,767
Good. Give me two
seconds between...
