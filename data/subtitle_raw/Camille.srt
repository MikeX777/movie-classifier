1
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,970
From 2013 to 2015, civil war

2
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:28,967
tore the Central African Republic apart.

3
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:31,617
Seleka and Anti-Balaka militias clashed,

4
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,420
pitting Muslims and Christians against each other.

5
00:00:34,574 --> 00:00:36,417
Thousands of people were killed,

6
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,337
a million were displaced.

7
00:00:40,065 --> 00:00:42,638
Camille Lepage covered the conflict

8
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:46,132
from October 2013 to May 2014.

9
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:14,625
Central African Republic – May 12, 2014

10
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,318
Blue Unit, Blue Unit!

11
00:01:41,313 --> 00:01:42,657
Blue listening.

12
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,650
There's a convoy advancing in our direction.

13
00:01:48,878 --> 00:01:52,103
A truck and a dozen motorcycles.

14
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:55,751
David, can you see if they're armed?

15
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:58,247
Affirmative. They're armed. I see AKs...

16
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:00,858
They're armed. It's a group of Anti-Balaka.

17
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:02,279
What do we do?

18
00:02:04,122 --> 00:02:07,079
I repeat. Anti-Balaka approaching.

19
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:10,036
Prepare to establish contact. Take no risks.

20
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,839
Ok, preparing to establish contact.

21
00:02:14,337 --> 00:02:15,719
David, stay above.

22
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:17,255
In position.

23
00:02:23,668 --> 00:02:26,586
Stefan, to the left. Galiano, to the right.

24
00:02:32,922 --> 00:02:36,110
Calm down! I can't hear what you're saying.

25
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,721
Turn off the engines.

26
00:02:38,874 --> 00:02:40,756
Lower your weapon.

27
00:02:42,138 --> 00:02:44,826
Can we come forward?

28
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:48,129
What's going on?

29
00:02:48,282 --> 00:02:50,318
Lower your weapon.

30
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:55,886
Calm down.

31
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,031
Does anyone speak French here?

32
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:07,214
Everyone, calm down.

33
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,134
What's going on?

34
00:03:09,364 --> 00:03:10,170
Look.

35
00:03:10,746 --> 00:03:12,474
What's underneath?

36
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:24,225
Blue Unit, there are five bodies in the vehicle.

37
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:27,642
Four Central Africans and one white woman.

38
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:49,454
Perpignan – September 7, 2013

39
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,978
Festival of Photojournalism "Visa pour l'image"

40
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:02,548
Pardon.

41
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:20,730
Thanks.

42
00:07:21,153 --> 00:07:23,073
Got it all? – Yeah.

43
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,545
Don't take any risks.

44
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:41,735
I promise.

45
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:42,734
You promise?

46
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:45,690
You said that last time and took some anyway.

47
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:48,839
Be careful.

48
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:12,494
The Central African Republic (CAR).

49
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:14,414
Since their coup in March 2013,

50
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,487
Seleka rebels have sowed terror.

51
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:19,905
On November 16, they assassinate a judge.

52
00:08:33,998 --> 00:08:38,606
Bangui – November 22, 2013

53
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,748
You're all students? – All of us.

54
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,474
What are you studying? – Us three, Economy.

55
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,279
At the university over there?

56
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:52,391
You're a journalist? – Yeah.

57
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:55,118
You work for? – I'm a photographer.

58
00:08:55,271 --> 00:08:58,190
You have to talk about us and our situation.

59
00:08:58,343 --> 00:09:00,916
That's why I'm here. – Tell the world.

60
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,026
We're sick of it! We want the truth.

61
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:05,831
We're suffering.

62
00:09:11,361 --> 00:09:12,666
Is this the campus?

63
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:14,049
Yeah!

64
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:18,081
You have class here? – We live here.

65
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:28,564
Leïla, are you Muslim? – No, I'm Christian.

66
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:30,138
But isn't your name...

67
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:31,943
My father's Muslim.

68
00:09:38,318 --> 00:09:39,930
Keep your shoes on.

69
00:09:40,084 --> 00:09:43,233
I'm not the President! It says "no exceptions."

70
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:46,266
You're our guest. We don't mind.

71
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:49,146
So whose room is this?

72
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,951
The boys' room.

73
00:09:51,105 --> 00:09:53,370
Just boys? – Yes, four of us.

74
00:09:53,524 --> 00:09:54,791
This is my bed.

75
00:09:54,945 --> 00:09:56,404
And that's your guitar? – Yep.

76
00:09:56,558 --> 00:09:59,630
Everyone, get together for a group photo.

77
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:02,010
Smile!

78
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:10,266
No running water?

79
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,801
No, we go downstairs to get it.

80
00:10:12,954 --> 00:10:14,030
Since when?

81
00:10:14,183 --> 00:10:16,065
Over ten years.

82
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:18,100
Decades.

83
00:10:19,175 --> 00:10:22,708
Did the coup change things? – A lot.

84
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,087
Like what? – Lots of robbing, killing.

85
00:10:26,241 --> 00:10:28,967
Lots of violence. – Like during the mutinies.

86
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:30,158
No, no...

87
00:10:30,311 --> 00:10:32,423
Before the Muslims, things were good.

88
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:35,150
Why accuse the Muslims? – It's true.

89
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:38,375
Muslims aren't all Seleka. Look at Abdou.

90
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:40,026
We're the first victims.

91
00:10:40,218 --> 00:10:42,906
My cousin was robbed and tortured.

92
00:10:43,444 --> 00:10:45,825
Our entire neighborhood was pillaged.

93
00:10:46,017 --> 00:10:47,514
You're talking about one cousin.

94
00:10:47,668 --> 00:10:49,204
I don't agree.

95
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,465
It's different. – Muslims brought the Seleka.

96
00:10:54,657 --> 00:10:56,807
Don't lump them all together.

97
00:10:56,961 --> 00:10:58,420
It's the Muslims!

98
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,338
You support the Seleka, don't you? – Idiot.

99
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,833
I'm gonna engage you. – You should!

100
00:11:04,986 --> 00:11:06,484
What does "engage" mean?

101
00:11:06,638 --> 00:11:09,134
I'm gonna smack him! He's a thug!

102
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:11,130
I'm 25 years old. – 25?

103
00:11:12,014 --> 00:11:15,047
You're not scared coming to a country in crisis?

104
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:16,929
Am I too old or too young?

105
00:11:17,082 --> 00:11:18,042
Too young!

106
00:11:18,196 --> 00:11:21,230
You're not afraid of the shooting?

107
00:11:21,383 --> 00:11:23,610
I'm interested. – Really?

108
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:25,377
Interested in what?

109
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,874
What good does it do us?

110
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:30,714
Your pictures. – What do we get out of it?

111
00:11:30,868 --> 00:11:32,519
When you protest,

112
00:11:32,673 --> 00:11:33,748
what do you get?

113
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,358
We do it for the country.

114
00:11:37,511 --> 00:11:39,162
It's the same for me.

115
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,578
If I wanted to become rich, I wouldn't be here.

116
00:11:43,732 --> 00:11:45,690
I'm here because...

117
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:48,148
I want to show what's happening.

118
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,337
I want to support your country,

119
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,255
and incite people to come help.

120
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:54,714
Are you married?

121
00:11:54,868 --> 00:11:56,711
You always talk about money!

122
00:11:56,865 --> 00:11:58,746
We can talk about other things.

123
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:01,473
Are you married?

124
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:02,548
No.

125
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:05,466
Any children? – No.

126
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,001
Are your parents worried? – Yes.

127
00:12:08,154 --> 00:12:09,767
Aren't they afraid?

128
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:11,687
Yes, but they let me come.

129
00:12:11,841 --> 00:12:13,492
And you're not afraid?

130
00:12:13,953 --> 00:12:15,988
I'm interested in telling your story.

131
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,447
You're interested, ok,

132
00:12:17,601 --> 00:12:20,097
but aren't you afraid of the Seleka?

133
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,018
No.

134
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:37,070
It's 150. Don't pay him more.

135
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:41,140
We'll see you tomorrow. – See you then!

136
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:18,657
Chicken shawarma with garlic sauce.

137
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,154
And cabbage.

138
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:25,530
How's your family?

139
00:13:25,684 --> 00:13:28,410
How's your family? – Fine, thank you. You?

140
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:37,204
Give me 500 francs. – I did this morning!

141
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,970
Give 500!

142
00:13:39,124 --> 00:13:40,084
We're hungry.

143
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:41,121
Here.

144
00:13:42,887 --> 00:13:44,308
Share it.

145
00:13:46,113 --> 00:13:48,455
Share it! That's all I have.

146
00:15:13,473 --> 00:15:15,047
Early December 2013.

147
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:18,388
The capital is calm, but war wages in the North.

148
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,729
The Seleka are pillaging and burning villages.

149
00:15:21,882 --> 00:15:24,878
The population forms self-defense militias:

150
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:25,838
the Anti-Balaka.

151
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:35,630
Rodrigue, come here. Prepare table 7.

152
00:15:37,665 --> 00:15:39,470
What do you want? – A beer.

153
00:15:39,623 --> 00:15:41,812
What about some sauerkraut? – No.

154
00:15:48,878 --> 00:15:51,834
Excuse me, are you journalists?

155
00:15:52,065 --> 00:15:54,100
Yes. What gave us away?

156
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,711
My name is Camille. I'm a photographer.

157
00:15:57,863 --> 00:15:59,860
I'm François, journalist.

158
00:16:00,014 --> 00:16:02,778
François Quessemand from Le Monde. – Exactly.

159
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:03,892
I'm Camille Lepage.

160
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,388
I sent you some pictures via email.

161
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,655
Ok. I didn't reply?

162
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:09,729
No. – I'll do it soon.

163
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:12,071
I wanted to know if by chance

164
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:14,106
you needed a photographer.

165
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:16,948
I'm accompanied by this ravishing creature.

166
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,791
Hi. – Michaël Zumstein.

167
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,366
Pleased to meet you.

168
00:16:21,287 --> 00:16:22,401
Mathias Fincher.

169
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,972
Your pictures of Gaza in the New York Times

170
00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:27,162
were simply...

171
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,543
They were amazing. – Thank you.

172
00:16:31,271 --> 00:16:34,305
So, what are your plans here?

173
00:16:34,497 --> 00:16:36,110
We hope to go north tomorrow.

174
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,644
Toward Bossangoa?

175
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,641
You're interested in the Anti-Balaka?

176
00:16:40,794 --> 00:16:42,753
I heard they might attack Bangui.

177
00:16:42,906 --> 00:16:44,327
That's the rumor.

178
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:45,748
With machetes...

179
00:16:47,054 --> 00:16:49,242
Can I come in the car with you?

180
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:55,194
Frankly, alone it's hard financially.

181
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:58,497
We would've been happy to, but...

182
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,110
It's not possible.

183
00:17:00,263 --> 00:17:02,145
At least, not this time.

184
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,412
Sorry.

185
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,332
Another time?

186
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:09,172
Ok, fine. Enjoy your meal.

187
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,729
Let's call it!

188
00:18:34,074 --> 00:18:35,150
Call the gozo!

189
00:18:51,623 --> 00:18:53,966
Do you know any Anti-Balaka?

190
00:18:58,574 --> 00:19:01,300
Yes, lots of people from my neighborhood.

191
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:02,951
Friends, too.

192
00:19:03,105 --> 00:19:05,217
So you know lots of people there?

193
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:08,097
Even my cousin is there.

194
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,362
How long has he been there?

195
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,780
Last month. The Seleka came for him.

196
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:16,161
But he escaped.

197
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:17,505
Near Bossangoa?

198
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:19,770
Yeah, near Paoua, Bossangoa.

199
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:21,191
Are they still there?

200
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,380
Yes.

201
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:27,220
And if I wanted to meet them?

202
00:19:28,948 --> 00:19:30,446
It's tricky.

203
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:32,404
It'll be complicated.

204
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:34,094
Djotodia, resign!

205
00:19:41,812 --> 00:19:43,425
The Seleka just killed again!

206
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,806
Take pictures! The world has to know!

207
00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:50,414
Djotodia, resign!

208
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:04,065
Djotodia, resign!

209
00:21:14,394 --> 00:21:15,623
A journalist!

210
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:17,774
Leave her alone!

211
00:21:24,762 --> 00:21:27,412
Look! I work here often.

212
00:21:27,566 --> 00:21:29,370
I'm here all the time. It's ok.

213
00:22:25,934 --> 00:22:27,124
It's Camille.

214
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,540
Come in.

215
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,268
What's going on?

216
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,495
The Seleka came last night.

217
00:22:35,649 --> 00:22:37,223
Why didn't you call me?

218
00:22:37,415 --> 00:22:38,798
They were everywhere.

219
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:40,679
What were they looking for?

220
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,444
Cyril. They must've spotted him at the protest.

221
00:22:43,598 --> 00:22:45,249
Because of his rap.

222
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:47,745
All I did was sing. – Against the Seleka!

223
00:22:47,937 --> 00:22:49,434
Someone snitched.

224
00:22:49,588 --> 00:22:51,546
You think they were looking for you?

225
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,966
I'm absolutely sure of it.

226
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:56,846
They were everywhere in the building.

227
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:58,190
They'll come back.

228
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:00,071
That's what scares me.

229
00:23:00,225 --> 00:23:02,490
We all hid on the roof yesterday.

230
00:23:02,644 --> 00:23:04,910
Do you have a place to go? – His sister's.

231
00:23:05,063 --> 00:23:06,791
But they're everywhere!

232
00:23:06,945 --> 00:23:09,326
They won't look for you there.

233
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:11,668
Staying here is too dangerous.

234
00:23:13,818 --> 00:23:16,314
Call if anything happens. – Ok.

235
00:23:16,468 --> 00:23:17,620
Wait...

236
00:23:17,774 --> 00:23:19,386
Here. Take it.

237
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:42,887
Did you want to go with him?

238
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,001
No.

239
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:48,609
Cyril's your boyfriend!

240
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:49,799
What?

241
00:23:49,953 --> 00:23:50,836
Tell me!

242
00:23:53,063 --> 00:23:54,561
Come on, you can tell me!

243
00:23:54,714 --> 00:23:57,210
Tell you what? – That he's your boyfriend.

244
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,129
Is it Abdou?

245
00:24:01,242 --> 00:24:03,585
With his crazy eyes!

246
00:24:11,111 --> 00:24:12,993
Want another? – Yes, thanks.

247
00:24:13,146 --> 00:24:14,106
Rodrigue?

248
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,601
Can we have another round, please?

249
00:24:19,214 --> 00:24:23,169
For my generation, it was Bosnia, Sarajevo.

250
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,703
It was insane.

251
00:24:25,895 --> 00:24:27,278
And I continued...

252
00:24:28,238 --> 00:24:29,966
Iraq, Afghanistan...

253
00:24:30,772 --> 00:24:34,074
I feel like I've had several lives, like a spy.

254
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:39,028
You never felt like staying put?

255
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,065
Not really.

256
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:44,788
Strange thing, going from country to country.

257
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,746
No... – Isn't it frustrating?

258
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:48,628
No, it's exciting.

259
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:54,042
Even without getting to know the people?

260
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:56,078
Getting to know the people? – Yeah.

261
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:57,921
Are you kidding?

262
00:24:58,074 --> 00:25:01,415
You can't from opposite sides of the camera.

263
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:04,180
What can you build? You're going back to France.

264
00:25:04,334 --> 00:25:05,985
You don't get to know people.

265
00:25:06,177 --> 00:25:09,018
You can't imagine what they're going through.

266
00:25:09,556 --> 00:25:12,321
You're screwed if you do that. Be careful!

267
00:25:15,124 --> 00:25:17,390
Well, I don't know...

268
00:25:21,076 --> 00:25:23,265
How about you? Get anything published?

269
00:25:23,457 --> 00:25:26,030
In South Sudan, I worked for AFP.

270
00:25:26,183 --> 00:25:29,140
Then I had some photos published.

271
00:25:29,716 --> 00:25:31,828
Right now, it's pretty rough.

272
00:25:32,212 --> 00:25:34,670
If France intervenes, you'll have work.

273
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:36,551
Did you contact Libération?

274
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:38,932
Wrote to the photo department. Nothing.

275
00:25:39,086 --> 00:25:41,044
Doesn't surprise me. Call Maria.

276
00:25:41,198 --> 00:25:43,310
Maria Malagardis. On my behalf.

277
00:25:43,463 --> 00:25:45,191
Ok. What does she do?

278
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:47,111
She's in charge of Africa.

279
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,225
Ok.

280
00:25:48,993 --> 00:25:50,375
Thanks a lot.

281
00:25:50,913 --> 00:25:51,950
It's nothing.

282
00:26:06,196 --> 00:26:10,074
Thursday, December 5, 2013

283
00:26:41,217 --> 00:26:43,329
Not now, not now. Tomorrow.

284
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,247
Easy!

285
00:26:49,972 --> 00:26:51,546
Go home! – It's fine!

286
00:27:20,922 --> 00:27:23,956
You're nuts walking here. – I had to leave!

287
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,223
Are the Anti-Balaka attacking?

288
00:27:25,415 --> 00:27:26,836
They were repelled.

289
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:30,023
The north of town is being hit: PK10, Boy-Rabe.

290
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,713
You can't stay over there.

291
00:27:31,866 --> 00:27:33,210
We'll find you a room here.

292
00:27:33,364 --> 00:27:35,169
I'll pay three times that.

293
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:36,935
However much you want.

294
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,314
Where is this van?

295
00:27:40,698 --> 00:27:41,505
Find a car?

296
00:27:44,346 --> 00:27:45,230
Hey.

297
00:27:45,383 --> 00:27:46,612
No one can bring it?

298
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:49,492
Out of 3,500 guys, no one can bring a van?

299
00:27:49,646 --> 00:27:51,642
I don't give a shit. I'm paying!

300
00:27:52,218 --> 00:27:54,638
Fuck me! The only vehicle in Bangui.

301
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:56,442
I know. – No driver?

302
00:27:56,596 --> 00:27:59,284
Nope. Know why? They're all afraid.

303
00:27:59,438 --> 00:28:02,318
I found 2 grenades in the glove compartment.

304
00:28:02,471 --> 00:28:04,929
I sent him home with twice the pay

305
00:28:05,082 --> 00:28:06,004
and kept the vehicle.

306
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:08,654
Mathias! We have to get going.

307
00:28:08,807 --> 00:28:10,266
Bringing your chick? – Shut up.

308
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:12,110
Have a problem with chicks?

309
00:28:12,263 --> 00:28:13,684
Thanks all the same.

310
00:28:15,066 --> 00:28:17,447
She's funny. – Yeah, hilarious.

311
00:28:31,732 --> 00:28:33,498
It's deserted.

312
00:28:43,636 --> 00:28:45,172
Hello, François Quessemand,

313
00:28:45,326 --> 00:28:46,593
from Le Monde.

314
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:50,394
Any update on the French intervention?

315
00:28:52,852 --> 00:28:54,887
Are they deploying today?

316
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,076
Hello? I was...

317
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,612
Ask where.

318
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:00,378
He hung up on me.

319
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:04,910
We're going to the hospital.

320
00:29:05,063 --> 00:29:07,367
Then to PK5 on the Muslim side.

321
00:29:07,521 --> 00:29:09,518
Stop! – What the hell is that?

322
00:29:11,054 --> 00:29:12,244
Holy shit.

323
00:31:32,634 --> 00:31:35,130
12:40 pm, Community Hospital morgue

324
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,242
The stench...

325
00:32:01,857 --> 00:32:03,700
See the ones that just arrived?

326
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:06,388
There are some outside, too. Go see.

327
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:27,278
Gimme a sec.

328
00:32:30,926 --> 00:32:32,538
Fuck! You never listen!

329
00:32:32,692 --> 00:32:34,074
Don't talk to me like that!

330
00:32:34,228 --> 00:32:35,956
You keep getting in the way!

331
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,684
She's always in front!

332
00:32:37,838 --> 00:32:39,719
We keep telling you. – Ballbreaker!

333
00:32:39,873 --> 00:32:41,524
Go fuck yourself!

334
00:32:42,138 --> 00:32:43,943
The CAR is holding its breath.

335
00:32:44,135 --> 00:32:46,593
Since last March, chaos has been complete.

336
00:32:46,746 --> 00:32:50,279
The French Army may intervene in coming days.

337
00:32:50,433 --> 00:32:53,159
They're awaiting the UN's green light

338
00:32:53,313 --> 00:32:55,079
and a resolution in coming hours.

339
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:57,114
The French have to come, for fuck's sake!

340
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:59,226
They're waiting for the UN's mandate.

341
00:32:59,418 --> 00:33:02,567
It's a bloodbath. They just need to come!

342
00:33:02,721 --> 00:33:06,830
We've intervened without a mandate too many times.

343
00:33:06,983 --> 00:33:08,327
That's what you don't get.

344
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:11,476
Mandate, my ass! It won't change a thing.

345
00:33:12,705 --> 00:33:14,471
We're out front.

346
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:20,039
Yes, in front of the shop.

347
00:33:34,516 --> 00:33:35,898
The Seleka went door to door,

348
00:33:36,052 --> 00:33:38,241
they killed my neighbor and came to my place.

349
00:33:38,394 --> 00:33:41,236
Where were you? – I hid behind the fridge.

350
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,772
The others, under the bed.

351
00:33:42,926 --> 00:33:45,806
Luckily, they didn't find us.

352
00:34:15,258 --> 00:34:16,564
Ladies and gentlemen,

353
00:34:16,948 --> 00:34:21,210
the situation in the CAR has become alarming

354
00:34:21,364 --> 00:34:22,977
and frightening.

355
00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:25,242
Massacres are still going on

356
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,855
as I speak.

357
00:34:27,086 --> 00:34:28,660
In the face of such chaos,

358
00:34:28,814 --> 00:34:30,580
the Security Council

359
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:33,345
unanimously adopted a resolution

360
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:36,417
to provide security,

361
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:39,066
restore stability

362
00:34:39,258 --> 00:34:41,447
and protect the population.

363
00:34:42,138 --> 00:34:45,134
France will support this operation.

364
00:34:47,438 --> 00:34:48,513
Shut up.

365
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:51,009
...we owe assistance and solidarity...

366
00:34:51,162 --> 00:34:52,276
Work's on its way.

367
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,196
I give them 10 min to call.

368
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:57,767
"Small country!" It's bigger than France.

369
00:34:57,921 --> 00:34:59,457
"A country that is our friend."

370
00:35:04,372 --> 00:35:06,100
Yes, speaking.

371
00:35:07,636 --> 00:35:08,980
It's Libération!

372
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:13,127
Can I send them tonight?

373
00:35:13,281 --> 00:35:14,625
What else? Show me.

374
00:35:15,393 --> 00:35:18,119
C'mon, agree already! – Not that one.

375
00:35:18,503 --> 00:35:21,306
Not that one? – This one and the other one.

376
00:35:22,151 --> 00:35:23,687
Hit send.

377
00:35:27,105 --> 00:35:28,948
Here's to your publication.

378
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:31,482
To Camille!

379
00:35:32,135 --> 00:35:33,095
To France!

380
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:44,270
December 8, 2013

381
00:35:44,423 --> 00:35:46,958
Arrival of French troops in the CAR

382
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:07,809
Walk!

383
00:36:23,322 --> 00:36:25,396
We're pillaging the Muslims.

384
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:31,578
December 10, 2013 – Fouh Mosque

385
00:37:32,289 --> 00:37:34,746
...several armored troop vehicles.

386
00:37:34,938 --> 00:37:36,436
Boali Camp command

387
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,894
says the imminent French reinforcement

388
00:37:39,047 --> 00:37:40,929
coming from Cameroun and Gabon

389
00:37:41,082 --> 00:37:42,734
already has a dissuasive effect.

390
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:45,767
But witnesses speak of pillaging and violence

391
00:37:45,921 --> 00:37:46,958
in certain neighborhoods.

392
00:37:47,534 --> 00:37:49,185
The torrential rain

393
00:37:49,377 --> 00:37:52,948
may calm Christian and Muslim armed gangs.

394
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,868
Many casualties yesterday.

395
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,055
80 bodies, some burnt, inside a mosque,

396
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,898
many cadavers along the roads,

397
00:38:00,052 --> 00:38:03,700
and 50 bodies were brought to the local morgue.

398
00:38:03,854 --> 00:38:07,694
The wounded need treatment in a climate of fear.

399
00:38:07,847 --> 00:38:11,034
The streets are clear of traffic. A supermarket...

400
00:38:39,335 --> 00:38:40,526
During Seleka disarmament,

401
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,484
the Anti-Balaka went on the offensive

402
00:38:42,638 --> 00:38:46,132
hunting down the last Muslims in poorer districts.

403
00:38:46,286 --> 00:38:47,745
France watched, helpless,

404
00:38:47,937 --> 00:38:49,626
the rising tide of violence.

405
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:05,870
Keep driving.

406
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,473
Keep going.

407
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:16,276
Don't stop.

408
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,774
We're the press!

409
00:39:18,311 --> 00:39:19,694
We're the press!

410
00:39:20,922 --> 00:39:21,729
Calm down!

411
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:23,226
Accelerate.

412
00:39:23,418 --> 00:39:24,686
Journalist!

413
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:27,719
We're the press! Calm down!

414
00:39:27,873 --> 00:39:28,833
Easy!

415
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,575
We're through.

416
00:39:46,151 --> 00:39:47,111
It's over.

417
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,676
That's too much.

418
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:22,439
5,000 is too expensive.

419
00:40:22,593 --> 00:40:25,166
And for pay-on-arrival?

420
00:40:27,969 --> 00:40:29,082
Just a minute.

421
00:40:29,236 --> 00:40:30,580
You have enough?

422
00:40:30,734 --> 00:40:32,730
I'll pay half now, half on arrival.

423
00:40:32,884 --> 00:40:34,420
I can give you the money.

424
00:40:34,574 --> 00:40:36,762
No, it's ok. – I can lend you money.

425
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:39,489
My brother will pay the other half.

426
00:40:39,642 --> 00:40:42,330
You have enough for the trip and 3 days of food?

427
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:43,559
I'm good, thanks.

428
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:44,980
It's fine.

429
00:40:45,134 --> 00:40:47,399
Take care of yourself. – Thanks.

430
00:40:48,014 --> 00:40:49,473
Call when you reach Cameroun.

431
00:40:49,626 --> 00:40:51,201
I'll stay in touch.

432
00:40:51,354 --> 00:40:52,775
I need your number there.

433
00:40:52,929 --> 00:40:56,078
I'll call you once I get there.

434
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,026
He's pay-on-arrival.

435
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:09,940
2,500 now.

436
00:41:16,737 --> 00:41:18,311
Take care of yourself.

437
00:41:22,228 --> 00:41:23,226
Goodbye.

438
00:41:26,682 --> 00:41:27,911
We stay in touch?

439
00:41:28,065 --> 00:41:29,255
We stay in touch.

440
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,111
Come in.

441
00:42:35,687 --> 00:42:36,801
What are you doing here?

442
00:42:37,607 --> 00:42:39,988
I was looking for you. – How are you?

443
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,484
It's been days since you disappeared.

444
00:42:42,638 --> 00:42:45,210
I'm sorry. I've been so busy with work.

445
00:42:45,364 --> 00:42:47,399
Don't drop friends like that!

446
00:42:47,553 --> 00:42:49,012
I thought you might've left.

447
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,009
I'm sorry. How are you?

448
00:42:51,162 --> 00:42:52,391
It's heated in your neighborhood.

449
00:42:52,545 --> 00:42:55,233
People are fleeing because they're scared.

450
00:42:55,386 --> 00:42:57,306
They're taking shelter at the airport.

451
00:42:57,498 --> 00:42:58,727
Have you fled too?

452
00:42:58,881 --> 00:43:00,110
No, I'm not scared.

453
00:43:00,263 --> 00:43:03,374
We're waiting to see how things evolve.

454
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,522
We will die here!

455
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,516
Obey the soldiers! Move back!

456
00:44:17,294 --> 00:44:19,137
Shit, it's gory.

457
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,361
You were there all day? – Yeah.

458
00:44:24,014 --> 00:44:26,049
They're cutting his dick off.

459
00:44:27,354 --> 00:44:29,198
Did you photograph that too?

460
00:44:29,351 --> 00:44:32,001
Her baptism by fire. – What a baptism...

461
00:44:33,575 --> 00:44:34,535
Ok, I'm sending it.

462
00:44:34,689 --> 00:44:36,494
You can't send that!

463
00:44:36,647 --> 00:44:39,642
Would you rather we took pictures of the sunset?

464
00:44:39,796 --> 00:44:43,060
Imagine if the victim's family sees these photos.

465
00:44:43,367 --> 00:44:44,750
Bullshit argument.

466
00:44:44,903 --> 00:44:46,977
In France, you'd think differently.

467
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:49,550
This isn't France. People are getting macheted!

468
00:44:50,241 --> 00:44:53,006
Where's these photos' journalistic value?

469
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:55,233
It's gratuitous. – Gratuitous?

470
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:58,612
They tell the story of what's happening here!

471
00:44:58,766 --> 00:44:59,841
Gratuitous, my ass.

472
00:44:59,994 --> 00:45:02,183
They tell that Africans are savages?

473
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:04,026
Are you fucking nuts?

474
00:45:04,372 --> 00:45:06,138
We're not inventing the violence!

475
00:45:06,292 --> 00:45:08,596
Ever wonder if it's not for our benefit?

476
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:12,282
"Take pictures!" They're putting on a show.

477
00:45:51,566 --> 00:45:53,178
I was a friend of Leïla's.

478
00:45:53,332 --> 00:45:55,674
We met at the university.

479
00:45:55,828 --> 00:45:58,209
She told me about you. You're Camille?

480
00:45:58,362 --> 00:46:01,204
Thank you. – I was very fond of her.

481
00:46:01,473 --> 00:46:02,778
That's kind of you.

482
00:46:03,086 --> 00:46:04,238
Thank you.

483
00:46:05,198 --> 00:46:06,158
My condolences.

484
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:29,639
The Seleka forced an elder out of this house

485
00:47:29,793 --> 00:47:31,406
and Leïla tried to intervene.

486
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:32,826
They called her a slut!

487
00:47:33,018 --> 00:47:34,286
She said, "My name is Leïla."

488
00:47:34,439 --> 00:47:35,514
A Muslim name.

489
00:47:35,668 --> 00:47:38,433
"How dare you say that!" And they killed her.

490
00:47:38,586 --> 00:47:41,505
We'll never have peace with the Muslims here.

491
00:47:41,697 --> 00:47:42,926
Cyril is right!

492
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:44,654
We must clean the country.

493
00:47:44,807 --> 00:47:48,110
But it's their country, too! They were born here.

494
00:47:48,263 --> 00:47:49,031
They're all the same!

495
00:47:49,185 --> 00:47:51,489
We take them in and look what they do!

496
00:47:51,642 --> 00:47:54,561
It won't go unpunished. – Meaning what?

497
00:47:55,636 --> 00:47:57,863
That's your answer? Use your head!

498
00:47:58,055 --> 00:48:00,743
You're lecturing me? That's the problem with you!

499
00:48:00,935 --> 00:48:02,663
You think this is your country.

500
00:48:02,855 --> 00:48:04,775
This isn't your home, ok?

501
00:48:04,929 --> 00:48:07,118
Colonization is over! – What's your point?

502
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:08,730
You destroy all our leaders.

503
00:48:08,884 --> 00:48:11,034
You killed Boganda, ousted David Dacko.

504
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:12,225
And Bokassa, too!

505
00:48:12,417 --> 00:48:14,375
And Patassé! – You wreak havoc!

506
00:48:14,529 --> 00:48:16,103
Who is "you"? Me?

507
00:48:16,295 --> 00:48:18,177
You think you're different?

508
00:48:19,137 --> 00:48:22,017
You're the same. All you want is your photos!

509
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:24,398
You come, you take, and you leave!

510
00:49:12,244 --> 00:49:14,049
You're a great photographer.

511
00:49:16,506 --> 00:49:17,735
You are.

512
00:49:19,271 --> 00:49:20,538
And you know it.

513
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:39,278
You need to protect yourself.

514
00:49:40,276 --> 00:49:42,119
It's time to think about you.

515
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,809
I mean it.

516
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:47,188
It's important.

517
00:49:47,802 --> 00:49:49,761
It's important, darling.

518
00:49:50,644 --> 00:49:53,601
Otherwise, you won't be able to continue.

519
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,628
You need to take a step back, have some fun.

520
00:50:05,006 --> 00:50:06,695
Let's go for a walk.

521
00:50:07,233 --> 00:50:08,193
Ok?

522
00:50:09,153 --> 00:50:09,882
Come on.

523
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:17,562
Put your shoes on!

524
00:50:17,716 --> 00:50:19,406
I don't feel like it.

525
00:50:19,866 --> 00:50:20,865
Come on, Camille.

526
00:50:23,476 --> 00:50:24,474
It'll be good for you.

527
00:50:24,628 --> 00:50:26,241
I'm so tired.

528
00:50:30,926 --> 00:50:33,690
No, wait! She's cheating!

529
00:50:35,303 --> 00:50:36,801
You used both hands!

530
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:41,370
Angers – December 25, 2013

531
00:50:41,716 --> 00:50:43,444
You'd never stooped so low!

532
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,170
She's been my cross to carry for years!

533
00:50:46,593 --> 00:50:48,551
For 5 years, she was covered in pimples!

534
00:50:48,705 --> 00:50:50,510
No! You're so mean!

535
00:50:50,663 --> 00:50:52,660
You can't make fun of that!

536
00:50:52,814 --> 00:50:53,966
She kept whining,

537
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:57,230
"I'm ugly, I'm fat, no one loves me!"

538
00:50:57,383 --> 00:50:58,535
Only I could stand her.

539
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:00,148
You loved me.

540
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,761
Yes, I loved you.

541
00:51:01,914 --> 00:51:04,103
Then, she bloomed into a photographer!

542
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:05,409
Have you heard?

543
00:51:05,908 --> 00:51:07,905
She decided to save Africa!

544
00:51:08,097 --> 00:51:11,207
She said, "All those poor little black people!

545
00:51:11,361 --> 00:51:12,666
It's not fair!

546
00:51:12,858 --> 00:51:15,393
I will speak out for those who suffer!

547
00:51:15,546 --> 00:51:17,966
Cursed countries don't exist! I'm going!

548
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:20,654
Mom, can you help me out for a few months?

549
00:51:20,807 --> 00:51:22,458
I mean a few years!"

550
00:51:23,879 --> 00:51:27,028
"I won't do an internship, Mom. Don't insist.

551
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,986
No, I won't work in France!

552
00:51:29,178 --> 00:51:30,983
I have important battles to fight."

553
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:33,210
Wait, hello?

554
00:51:33,364 --> 00:51:35,015
The New York Times?

555
00:51:35,169 --> 00:51:36,282
Yes, yes...

556
00:51:36,436 --> 00:51:38,087
It's the New York Times!

557
00:51:38,241 --> 00:51:40,468
Yes, it's Camille Lepage.

558
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,850
Camille 'The Page'."

559
00:51:42,887 --> 00:51:44,999
Loser alert! – Thanks a lot.

560
00:51:45,153 --> 00:51:47,457
Then one day, I was at the dentist's

561
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:50,106
and I read a magazine in the waiting room.

562
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:54,945
What do I see? Camille’s 5-page photo spread.

563
00:51:56,097 --> 00:51:58,094
Fuck! That's my sister!

564
00:51:58,247 --> 00:52:01,358
Hey guys! You, with the cavity, look at this!

565
00:52:01,511 --> 00:52:03,316
My sister took these!

566
00:52:03,969 --> 00:52:06,081
I was so proud.

567
00:52:06,234 --> 00:52:08,116
Look what she's achieved.

568
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:09,383
All that to say,

569
00:52:09,575 --> 00:52:11,418
little sis', I wasn't very supportive,

570
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,145
because I had doubts.

571
00:52:14,337 --> 00:52:17,140
It seemed impossible to me.

572
00:52:18,023 --> 00:52:19,214
But...

573
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:21,287
you did it.

574
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,937
What you've done is amazing.

575
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:26,548
I'm so proud of you. – We all are.

576
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:28,430
There's no reason to be.

577
00:52:29,466 --> 00:52:31,233
You crazy or what?

578
00:52:31,386 --> 00:52:33,652
If France intervened, it's because of you.

579
00:52:33,806 --> 00:52:35,726
But what will it change for them?

580
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:39,834
I don't know what to tell you.

581
00:52:39,988 --> 00:52:41,255
Boys?

582
00:52:41,946 --> 00:52:43,674
Zero in that department.

583
00:52:44,711 --> 00:52:45,441
Zero?

584
00:52:45,594 --> 00:52:46,708
Not even one.

585
00:52:47,169 --> 00:52:49,550
When's the last time you had sex, girl?

586
00:52:49,703 --> 00:52:51,585
Please don't start!

587
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:57,537
What happened?

588
00:53:00,954 --> 00:53:02,337
It's complicated.

589
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:04,334
Not even a flirt with a student?

590
00:53:04,487 --> 00:53:05,332
No.

591
00:53:10,362 --> 00:53:12,244
You met people, didn't you?

592
00:53:12,743 --> 00:53:13,895
Of course.

593
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:18,887
But being white over there sucks.

594
00:53:22,612 --> 00:53:25,185
You meet people, but ultimately...

595
00:54:04,698 --> 00:54:06,695
The star is back? – How are you?

596
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:09,038
When'd you get back? – A few days ago.

597
00:54:09,191 --> 00:54:11,649
You going back? – Not sure yet.

598
00:54:12,263 --> 00:54:13,914
How was it over there?

599
00:54:15,258 --> 00:54:16,295
Cheers!

600
00:54:16,794 --> 00:54:18,983
Was it hard, Camille? – What?

601
00:54:19,175 --> 00:54:20,711
All the violence.

602
00:54:20,865 --> 00:54:23,630
The horrible images. Did you see all that?

603
00:54:23,783 --> 00:54:25,127
What? – Did you see that?

604
00:54:25,281 --> 00:54:26,510
Yep. – It's nuts.

605
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:28,852
Yep, totally.

606
00:54:29,082 --> 00:54:30,810
Another one, please.

607
00:54:59,802 --> 00:55:02,030
Pleased to meet you. We can kiss hello.

608
00:55:02,682 --> 00:55:04,794
Shall we go to my office?

609
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:08,788
Coffee? – No, thank you.

610
00:55:12,474 --> 00:55:14,049
Jill, this is Camille.

611
00:55:14,202 --> 00:55:16,314
She took the CAR pictures for us.

612
00:55:16,468 --> 00:55:18,158
Nice to meet you. Great job.

613
00:55:18,311 --> 00:55:20,078
Thomas, this is Camille Lepage.

614
00:55:20,231 --> 00:55:22,727
You did a great job. – Thank you.

615
00:55:24,762 --> 00:55:25,991
Excuse me.

616
00:55:27,642 --> 00:55:29,678
None of it interests you?

617
00:55:30,484 --> 00:55:33,364
I'm proposing totally different things.

618
00:55:33,518 --> 00:55:36,705
We've already talked about the CAR.

619
00:55:36,897 --> 00:55:38,126
We're done.

620
00:55:38,279 --> 00:55:39,815
Unless something new happens.

621
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:41,159
Things are happening!

622
00:55:41,313 --> 00:55:42,657
Hundreds of thousands of refugees.

623
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:45,498
People are dying! What more do you want?

624
00:55:45,652 --> 00:55:46,420
I know.

625
00:55:47,188 --> 00:55:48,993
What about Ukraine?

626
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:52,641
What do you say? How about going to Ukraine?

627
00:55:52,794 --> 00:55:53,486
I don't understand.

628
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:56,020
Jan Andersen is going for us.

629
00:55:57,633 --> 00:55:59,092
What do you think?

630
00:56:02,586 --> 00:56:04,199
Me going to Ukraine?

631
00:56:06,042 --> 00:56:07,732
I'm talking about the CAR.

632
00:56:07,886 --> 00:56:10,689
You're not going to become a specialist of CAR.

633
00:56:12,378 --> 00:56:14,030
Think about Ukraine.

634
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:12,858
Easy, easy.

635
00:57:13,319 --> 00:57:14,625
I'm here to see Cyril.

636
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:17,006
He's a student.

637
00:57:17,428 --> 00:57:18,849
You want a cigarette?

638
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:21,383
Yeah. Give me a cigarette.

639
00:57:24,071 --> 00:57:26,874
Do you know him? He's tall and thin.

640
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,063
No? He didn't come here?

641
00:57:31,098 --> 00:57:32,750
Give me three. – No.

642
00:57:34,247 --> 00:57:35,783
I'm giving you one.

643
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,932
What's your name? – Death Defier.

644
00:57:40,737 --> 00:57:42,004
And you? – Five Minutes.

645
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:44,078
Five Minutes? And you're Two Minutes?

646
00:57:44,231 --> 00:57:46,074
Who's One Minute?

647
00:57:46,535 --> 00:57:48,609
I'm Yanguiré. Who are you?

648
00:57:48,762 --> 00:57:49,684
Camille.

649
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:52,372
Why're you here? – I'm looking for my friend.

650
00:57:52,526 --> 00:57:53,255
You're a spy.

651
00:57:53,409 --> 00:57:55,598
I'm just looking for Cyril.

652
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:59,169
He's not here? Ok, I'm going then.

653
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,703
You're pretty.

654
00:58:02,164 --> 00:58:03,393
Thanks. – I love you.

655
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:04,430
You love me?

656
00:58:04,583 --> 00:58:06,772
That was fast!

657
00:58:07,425 --> 00:58:08,385
That was fast!

658
00:58:08,577 --> 00:58:09,882
Don't touch my bag.

659
00:58:10,036 --> 00:58:11,495
Stop.

660
00:58:12,993 --> 00:58:15,335
Easy! Calm down!

661
00:58:25,434 --> 00:58:26,894
Get back to your posts!

662
00:58:27,047 --> 00:58:28,007
Why are you here?

663
00:58:28,161 --> 00:58:30,196
I was looking for my friend Cyril.

664
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,348
Who is Cyril?

665
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,652
A friend. He's not here. I'll go.

666
00:58:33,806 --> 00:58:34,842
Do I look stupid?

667
00:58:34,996 --> 00:58:36,686
No, I didn't mean... – Give me that!

668
00:58:36,839 --> 00:58:38,030
To the office!

669
00:58:38,183 --> 00:58:40,602
I don't need to go to the office. Wait!

670
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:41,754
Give me my phone.

671
00:58:41,908 --> 00:58:43,098
Forget the office.

672
00:58:43,252 --> 00:58:45,326
My taxi is waiting. Easy!

673
00:58:45,479 --> 00:58:47,207
I'm going. – Move!

674
00:59:29,294 --> 00:59:30,446
Back off!

675
01:00:09,767 --> 01:00:12,110
Good day to you, sir. – At ease.

676
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:20,250
Hello.

677
01:00:27,316 --> 01:00:28,545
Speak out loud!

678
01:00:28,852 --> 01:00:29,889
Yes, that's me.

679
01:00:32,615 --> 01:00:34,190
Why did you come in secret?

680
01:00:34,343 --> 01:00:36,263
I didn't. I have an authorization.

681
01:00:39,758 --> 01:00:41,908
I don't understand what you're saying.

682
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:47,476
I'm not with RFI radio. – You're a spy!

683
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:49,242
A spy? – Yes!

684
01:00:58,958 --> 01:01:00,570
Calm down!

685
01:01:09,364 --> 01:01:11,092
I don't... – We're not criminals!

686
01:01:11,246 --> 01:01:13,511
You don't know what's going on here.

687
01:01:13,665 --> 01:01:15,201
You say what suits you.

688
01:01:15,354 --> 01:01:16,890
I've been here a long time.

689
01:01:17,044 --> 01:01:19,041
I was here when Judge Bria was killed.

690
01:01:19,194 --> 01:01:20,039
Were you?

691
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:23,188
I was with Tanguy Rézidou's family

692
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,492
when they pulled out the body. I was here.

693
01:01:25,646 --> 01:01:28,065
And when Fleury Doumana was killed, I was here.

694
01:01:28,257 --> 01:01:30,638
On December 5, I went to Boy-Rabe.

695
01:02:05,351 --> 01:02:07,194
You've been here since December?

696
01:02:09,498 --> 01:02:10,804
Do you like it here?

697
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:13,722
It's my new home.

698
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:19,713
You have a gun. Does that mean you're a chief?

699
01:02:21,134 --> 01:02:22,554
They trust me.

700
01:03:31,943 --> 01:03:34,170
They are young. My age.

701
01:03:34,324 --> 01:03:36,513
We can laugh together, make jokes...

702
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:39,854
Do they realize the violence they commit?

703
01:03:40,007 --> 01:03:42,657
Do they realize how horrific their actions are?

704
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:44,577
When someone has killed,

705
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:47,150
can you see it in their eyes?

706
01:04:49,895 --> 01:04:52,430
You sure you want to come with us?

707
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:54,004
I'm sure!

708
01:07:45,191 --> 01:07:46,650
Thank you!

709
01:08:17,486 --> 01:08:20,174
Did you get some sleep? – Yeah.

710
01:08:29,735 --> 01:08:31,540
Can I take your picture?

711
01:08:32,154 --> 01:08:32,961
Yes.

712
01:08:42,446 --> 01:08:44,020
What does that mean?

713
01:08:47,745 --> 01:08:49,089
I don't understand.

714
01:08:49,242 --> 01:08:52,391
He says, you're tiring with your pictures.

715
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:55,732
I don't speak French.

716
01:08:59,073 --> 01:09:00,839
My pictures tire you out?

717
01:09:00,993 --> 01:09:01,722
No.

718
01:09:02,874 --> 01:09:04,756
It bothers you? – Yes.

719
01:09:05,447 --> 01:09:07,060
It's not a problem.

720
01:09:07,713 --> 01:09:10,631
So many photos. Too many.

721
01:09:38,164 --> 01:09:39,508
What did he say?

722
01:09:42,926 --> 01:09:45,767
The Chief must come...

723
01:09:46,804 --> 01:09:50,030
quickly, so we can attack in Bambari.

724
01:09:50,183 --> 01:09:53,332
The Seleka have already caused a lot of trouble.

725
01:09:54,369 --> 01:09:55,175
Understand?

726
01:09:55,329 --> 01:09:56,634
You're in a hurry to go?

727
01:09:56,788 --> 01:09:57,518
Yes.

728
01:10:03,162 --> 01:10:04,852
You're not afraid of dying?

729
01:10:05,006 --> 01:10:05,850
No.

730
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:10,650
I'm fighting for my country.

731
01:10:10,804 --> 01:10:11,994
If I die...

732
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:17,601
that's a good thing.

733
01:10:17,754 --> 01:10:20,404
Because I'm fighting for my country.

734
01:10:20,634 --> 01:10:25,012
If I die, my little boy will...

735
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:30,311
He'll be sad?

736
01:10:30,465 --> 01:10:31,194
Yes.

737
01:10:33,767 --> 01:10:35,956
My French isn't good.

738
01:10:37,223 --> 01:10:40,487
You're doing a good job. I understand you.

739
01:13:28,602 --> 01:13:29,486
Fire!

740
01:15:07,444 --> 01:15:08,596
I don't understand.

741
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,167
That's bath water?

742
01:15:17,966 --> 01:15:18,926
A little.

743
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:26,644
I'll take this off.

744
01:16:44,903 --> 01:16:46,746
The Seleka killed her husband

745
01:16:46,938 --> 01:16:48,014
and her son.

746
01:16:49,242 --> 01:16:52,007
My aunt spent two months in the bush.

747
01:16:52,929 --> 01:16:55,118
Living on roots and leaves.

748
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:01,031
The Seleka killed a lot of people here.

749
01:17:02,106 --> 01:17:04,218
You understand the hell we live in?

750
01:17:07,367 --> 01:17:09,057
You've killed too.

751
01:17:09,518 --> 01:17:11,630
What's the idea? An eye for an eye?

752
01:17:11,783 --> 01:17:14,471
If everyone thinks like that, nothing will change.

753
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:17,889
You hunt down the Fulani, too. You never let up.

754
01:17:18,042 --> 01:17:19,578
And you wonder why they rebel?

755
01:17:19,732 --> 01:17:21,153
Don't talk to me like that.

756
01:17:21,537 --> 01:17:24,340
I didn't bring you here to get lectured.

757
01:17:25,377 --> 01:17:26,452
If you're not happy,

758
01:17:26,606 --> 01:17:27,988
go back to Bangui.

759
01:17:37,204 --> 01:17:37,857
Here.

760
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:41,390
Eat.

761
01:17:43,079 --> 01:17:45,038
You're not eating with us?

762
01:17:50,145 --> 01:17:52,679
You're her guest. You have to eat. Eat.

763
01:18:05,044 --> 01:18:07,118
You're getting better at that.

764
01:18:10,766 --> 01:18:11,841
Thank you.

765
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:17,946
Thank you.

766
01:18:20,327 --> 01:18:23,361
I told her how you helped me pay for the taxi

767
01:18:23,514 --> 01:18:25,473
when the Seleka came for me.

768
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:27,738
She thinks you saved my life.

769
01:18:27,892 --> 01:18:30,004
No, thank you for your kindness.

770
01:18:31,348 --> 01:18:34,113
What do you think about what Cyril does?

771
01:18:34,804 --> 01:18:37,492
What do you think about the Anti-Balaka?

772
01:18:59,265 --> 01:19:01,569
She wants you to take me to France

773
01:19:01,722 --> 01:19:02,682
for a better life.

774
01:19:02,836 --> 01:19:04,948
But if everyone leaves for France...

775
01:19:05,178 --> 01:19:07,598
This is where things need to change.

776
01:19:07,751 --> 01:19:09,556
The country needs to be re-built.

777
01:19:14,087 --> 01:19:16,199
I love your country.

778
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:20,154
See, I'm here, not in France.

779
01:19:20,308 --> 01:19:21,652
I don't live in France.

780
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:42,618
Here.

781
01:20:00,743 --> 01:20:02,279
All good? – Thank you.

782
01:20:02,433 --> 01:20:04,007
Have everything you need?

783
01:21:30,561 --> 01:21:33,479
Sometimes I wake up wondering what I'm doing here.

784
01:21:34,209 --> 01:21:37,511
Alone in the middle of this war that's not mine.

785
01:21:39,892 --> 01:21:41,735
What would I be doing in France?

786
01:21:43,271 --> 01:21:45,306
I'd have a job somewhere.

787
01:21:45,575 --> 01:21:47,764
We'd go for drinks and dance all night.

788
01:21:49,108 --> 01:21:50,145
Narcisse?

789
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:54,138
Why do I feel so good here?

790
01:21:57,978 --> 01:22:00,436
I'll always be a foreigner to them.

791
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:01,857
A white woman.

792
01:22:05,159 --> 01:22:06,004
And yet,

793
01:22:06,158 --> 01:22:08,961
I feel more at home here than anywhere else.

794
01:22:09,114 --> 01:22:11,150
I've always wanted to be here.

795
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:13,761
Alive like never before.

796
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:18,369
With my brothers.

797
01:22:19,137 --> 01:22:20,673
My human brothers.

798
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:39,527
How are you?

799
01:22:39,681 --> 01:22:40,718
Good.

800
01:22:56,270 --> 01:22:58,228
Hey! – How are you, Camille?

801
01:22:58,420 --> 01:22:59,457
And you? – Good.

802
01:24:21,594 --> 01:24:22,746
On May 12, 2014,

803
01:24:22,938 --> 01:24:25,550
Camille Lepage was caught in an ambush

804
01:24:25,703 --> 01:24:29,082
with the Anti-Balaka she was accompanying.

805
01:24:29,236 --> 01:24:32,001
Camille, the chief and three fighters

806
01:24:32,154 --> 01:24:34,036
were killed instantly.

807
01:25:01,146 --> 01:25:02,759
This film is based on true events.

808
01:25:02,913 --> 01:25:04,833
It is dedicated to all the victims

809
01:25:04,986 --> 01:25:06,830
of the Central African Republic crisis.
