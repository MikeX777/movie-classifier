(♪ Binge: Elizabethan Serenade )

385
00:38:47,545 --> 00:38:51,791
After the rise of Rock and Roll,
my interest in popular music waned,

386
00:38:51,966 --> 00:38:55,880
and as it declined,
my love of classical music increased.

387
00:38:56,053 --> 00:39:01,213
Sibelius, Shostakovich,
and my beloved Bruckner.

388
00:39:01,392 --> 00:39:04,761
Then, in my overwrought
adolescent state of mind,

389
00:39:04,937 --> 00:39:06,479
I discovered Mahler

390
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:11,854

to his every overwrought note.

391
00:39:12,027 --> 00:39:15,942

And on the train coming home,
slightly the worse for wear,

00:42:01,238 --> 00:42:04,939
howling at the papist moon.

431
00:42:07,494 --> 00:42:09,570
But no religious divide in my street,

432
00:42:09,747 --> 00:42:14,124
just quiet acceptance that Catholics
did everything in mysterious Latin,

433
00:42:14,293 --> 00:42:17,496
while Protestants sang,

Although sometimes,

436
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:27,923
it felt as if one's entire world
was one, long Sunday afternoon.

437
00:42:28,098 --> 00:42:31,016
Nothing to do. Nowhere to go.

438
00:42:32,102 --> 00:42:34,807
Then Mum or one of my sisters
would say,

439
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,854
"Let's have a day out next week.'

440
00:42:37,024 --> 00:42:41,650
And the ensuing seven days
were streaked and gilded.

441
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:45,980
But you still had to wait.

442
00:42:46,158 --> 00:42:49,028
Those days, queuing was de rigueur.

443
00:42:49,203 --> 00:42:53,035
Queuing modestly for modest
entertainment at the local fete.

444
00:42:53,207 --> 00:42:56,077
In posh parts of the city,
like Stoneycroft,

445
00:42:56,251 --> 00:43:00,201
where they sounded their 'H's
and knew what sculleries were.

446
00:43:04,093 --> 00:43:06,630
A jumble sale, a fancy dress parade,

447
00:43:06,804 --> 00:43:09,639
a foot race, with someone collapsing
with heat stroke

448
00:43:09,807 --> 00:43:14,018
because the temperature rose
a couple of degrees above freezing.

449
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:22,603
The Scouts, darts
and a May Queen crowned.

450

A Nation deprived of luxury,
relishing these small delights.

451
00:43:28,617 --> 00:43:33,528
Decorated prams and bicycles,
a smattering of applause.

453
00:43:41,171 --> 00:43:44,789

00:44:30,053 --> 00:44:33,968
now, as unacceptable

00:44:48,864 --> 00:44:53,193

deckchairs and the floral clock.

Sand in the egg sandwiches.

471
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:59,864
Tea at three, then a snooze.

472
00:45:01,084 --> 00:45:03,326
New Brighton rock as sweet as sick

473
00:45:03,503 --> 00:45:07,122
and gobstoppers that would last
until your middle age.

474
00:45:11,428 --> 00:45:15,640
A ride or two, then the miniature railway.

475
00:45:15,807 --> 00:45:18,808
Then maybe to the dance,
maybe a jive,

476
00:45:18,977 --> 00:45:22,927
maybe a gin and orange,
and maybe... love.

01:00:42,191 --> 01:00:45,477
In my end is my beginning.

519
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:55,120
"We meet our destiny on the road
we take to avoid it.' [Carl Jung]

520
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:03,283
I said to my soul, be still
and let the dark come upon you

521
01:01:03,462 --> 01:01:06,547
which shall be the darkness of God.

522
01:01:06,716 --> 01:01:11,294
I said to my soul, be still
and wait without hope,

523
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:14,044
for hope would be hope
for the wrong thing.

524
01:01:14,223 --> 01:01:18,007
Wait without love, for love
would be love of the wrong thing.

525
01:01:18,186 --> 01:01:20,012
There is yet faith.

526
01:01:20,188 --> 01:01:24,019
But the faith, the love and the hope
are all in the waiting -

527
01:01:24,192 --> 01:01:27,395
the rest is not our business -

528
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:29,812
at the still point of the turning world,

529
01:01:29,989 --> 01:01:34,117
suspended in time
between pole and tropic.

530
01:01:34,285 --> 01:01:37,369
And all is always now.

531
01:01:37,538 --> 01:01:39,994
Home is where one starts from.

532
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:43,036
As we grow older,
the world becomes stranger,

533
01:01:43,211 --> 01:01:47,078
the pattern more complicated
of dead and living.

534
01:01:47,256 --> 01:01:49,926
There is a time for the evening
under starlight;

535
01:01:50,092 --> 01:01:55,169
a time for the evening under lamplight;
the evening with the photograph album.

536
01:01:55,348 --> 01:02:00,888
Love is most nearly itself
when here and now cease to matter.

537
01:02:01,062 --> 01:02:04,929
I said to my soul, be still

538
01:02:05,107 --> 01:02:09,816
and accept this, my chanson d'amour
for all that has passed.

539
01:02:09,987 --> 01:02:13,902
But where, oh, where are you
the Liverpool I knew and loved?

540
01:02:14,075 --> 01:02:16,648
Where have you gone without me?

541
01:02:16,827 --> 01:02:21,074
And now I'm an alien in my own land.

542
01:02:21,249 --> 01:02:24,783
"O Tempora o mores.'

543
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:28,495
Oh, the times, oh, the fashions.

544
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:33,541
Tread gently, stranger
as you softly turn the key

545
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:39,093
To unlock time and cause the years
to fall towards their end

546
01:02:39,267 --> 01:02:42,600
Speak low, Love, but speak wisely

547
01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:46,139
For frail time hangs by a thread
above the world

548
01:02:46,315 --> 01:02:49,435
With only hope to keep us safe

549
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:54,568
Tap lightly at the door,
then close it with a silent shock

550
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:58,904
But never, ever yield to the night

551
01:03:01,789 --> 01:03:05,869
(♪ Faure: Dolly Suite )

552
01:03:13,384 --> 01:03:19,339
(♪ Piano plays nursery song)

553
01:04:49,522 --> 01:04:52,973
We shall return with hope
to the good earth.

554
01:04:53,943 --> 01:04:59,447
And you, my dear children,
you are the earth.

555
01:05:07,873 --> 01:05:12,037
But, I reason earth is short

556
01:05:12,211 --> 01:05:14,453
And anguish absolute

557
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:17,203
And many hurt

558
01:05:17,383 --> 01:05:19,210
But what of that?

559
01:05:21,929 --> 01:05:24,716
I reason, we could die:

560
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:29,552
The best vitality cannot excel decay

561
01:05:29,728 --> 01:05:32,564
But what of that?

562
01:05:33,274 --> 01:05:37,106
I reason that in heaven,
somehow it will be even

563
01:05:37,278 --> 01:05:40,481
Some new equation given

564
01:05:41,824 --> 01:05:43,900
But what of that?

565
01:05:44,076 --> 01:05:50,613
(♪ Horn note sings out)

566
01:06:13,856 --> 01:06:17,023
(Bells chime)

567
01:06:35,085 --> 01:06:37,707
We shall not cease from exploration.

568
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:42,043
And the end of all our exploring
will be to arrive where we started

569
01:06:42,218 --> 01:06:44,755
and to know the place for the first time.

570
01:06:45,554 --> 01:06:47,761
Through the unknown remembered gate,

571
01:06:47,932 --> 01:06:52,475
when the last of earth left to discover
is that which was the beginning.

572
01:06:52,645 --> 01:06:58,434
A condition of complete simplicity
costing not less than everything.

573
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:01,398
And all shall be well

574
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:06,612
And all manner of thing
shall be well.

575
01:07:13,457 --> 01:07:15,829
If all the world and Love were young

576
01:07:16,001 --> 01:07:18,575
And truth in every shepherd's tongue

577
01:07:18,754 --> 01:07:21,459
These pretty pleasures might me move

578
01:07:21,632 --> 01:07:24,835
To live with thee, and be thy love

579
01:07:25,010 --> 01:07:28,545
But time drives flocks from field to fold

580
01:07:28,722 --> 01:07:31,474
When rivers rage and rocks grow cold

581
01:07:31,642 --> 01:07:34,215
And Philomel becometh dumb

582
01:07:34,395 --> 01:07:37,396
The rest complains of cares to come

583
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:44,192
The flowers do fade, and wanton fields
to wayward winter reckoning yields

584
01:07:44,363 --> 01:07:46,984
A honey tongue, a heart of gall

585
01:07:47,157 --> 01:07:50,740
Is Fancy's spring but Sorrow's fall

586
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:54,363
Thy gowns, thy shoes,
thy beds of roses

587
01:07:54,873 --> 01:07:58,040
Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies

588
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:02,539
Soon break, soon wither,
soon forgotten

589
01:08:02,715 --> 01:08:06,712
In folly ripe, in reason rotten

590
01:08:06,885 --> 01:08:09,258
Thy belt of straw and ivy buds

591
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:12,466
Thy coral clasps and amber studs

592
01:08:12,641 --> 01:08:15,975
All those in me no means can move

593
01:08:16,145 --> 01:08:19,311
To come to thee and be thy love

594
01:08:19,481 --> 01:08:22,981
But could youth last and love still breed

595
01:08:23,152 --> 01:08:26,817
Had joys no date nor age no need

596
01:08:26,989 --> 01:08:30,737
Then those delights
my mind might move

597
01:08:30,909 --> 01:08:35,121
To live with thee and be thy love

598
01:08:40,919 --> 01:08:42,995
We are being gathered in...

599
01:08:44,256 --> 01:08:47,043
...at gloaming.

600
01:08:54,808 --> 01:08:57,180
Is it sleep?

601
01:08:57,353 --> 01:09:00,057
Or is it death?

602
01:09:00,856 --> 01:09:06,313
(Mahler: Resurrection,
triumphant chorus sings)

603
01:11:24,249 --> 01:11:26,705
Goodnight, ladies.

604
01:11:26,877 --> 01:11:30,460
Goodnight, sweet ladies.

605
01:11:30,631 --> 01:11:32,041
Goodnight.

606
01:11:32,633 --> 01:11:33,961
Goodnight.

607
01:11:34,802 --> 01:11:37,043
Goodnight.

608
01:11:39,056 --> 01:11:43,516
(♪ Liszt:
Consolation No.3 In D Flat Major)
