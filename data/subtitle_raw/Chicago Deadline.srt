1
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,626
Three doors down, Ed.

2
00:01:19,627 --> 00:01:20,627
15.

3
00:01:20,628 --> 00:01:22,545
She has no business here, anyway.

4
00:01:22,546 --> 00:01:24,214
I'll be glad to get her out.

5
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:26,508
First thing you know, I'll have trouble.

6
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:29,135
And Ed, don't mention the Rialto.

7
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:31,221
And don't be noisy.

8
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:33,932
There's a sick girl next door.

9
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:34,767
Ed!

10
00:01:34,768 --> 00:01:36,018
Do you hear me?

11
00:01:40,773 --> 00:01:43,107
Come in.

12
00:01:43,108 --> 00:01:45,735
- Hello.
- How do you do?

13
00:01:45,736 --> 00:01:47,278
It's all right, Minerva.

14
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:48,696
I just came to take you home.

15
00:01:48,697 --> 00:01:49,822
How did you know my name?

16
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:51,783
Are you a detective?

17
00:01:51,784 --> 00:01:53,535
No, I'm only a newspaper reporter.

18
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:54,410
Do you mind.

19
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:55,246
I'm not going home.

20
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:56,829
I'm going to lead my own life.

21
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,664
Oh?

22
00:01:57,665 --> 00:01:58,499
This kind of life?

23
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,667
I only came here because
it was closer to the station

24
00:02:00,668 --> 00:02:01,876
and I was going to move.

25
00:02:01,877 --> 00:02:03,628
Oh, sure, sure.

26
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:06,047
My mother's worried about me, isn't she?

27
00:02:06,048 --> 00:02:07,007
Al little.

28
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:09,592
She called the police, the
Missing Persons Bureau,

29
00:02:09,593 --> 00:02:12,053
the papers, the animal shelters.

30
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:17,059
The last I heard she was
trying to get the governor.

31
00:02:17,142 --> 00:02:18,351
Come on now, let's go.

32
00:02:18,352 --> 00:02:19,644
Will there be a story?

33
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:20,979
Only if the governor answers.

34
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:25,651
What's the matter?

35
00:02:26,694 --> 00:02:28,570
Miss Maggie!

36
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:29,571
Miss Maggie!

37
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:52,469
Take a good look, Minerva.

38
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:56,056
You could end up in a
place like this, too.

39
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:30,883
Dead!

40
00:03:30,884 --> 00:03:32,675
Lying there, her face all twisted.

41
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:35,303
I never thought she was sick as all that.

42
00:03:35,304 --> 00:03:37,222
Stop your blabbering.

43
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:43,145
Ed, get that little brat
in the next room out quick!

44
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:50,527
Ed, Ed, what'll I do?

45
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:52,571
Call the police.

46
00:03:52,613 --> 00:03:53,612
Oh, dear!

47
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:05,625
How long has she lived here, Maggie?

48
00:04:05,626 --> 00:04:06,794
Er, five days.

49
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:07,753
Ever been here before?

50
00:04:07,754 --> 00:04:09,837
Never laid eyes on her.

51
00:04:09,838 --> 00:04:10,922
Hi!

52
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:11,757
Hello, Adam.

53
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:13,216
What are you doing here?

54
00:04:13,217 --> 00:04:14,217
I saw your car downstairs,

55
00:04:14,218 --> 00:04:16,344
thought there might be something.

56
00:04:16,345 --> 00:04:18,596
Some dame kicked off.

57
00:04:18,597 --> 00:04:19,430
Yeah?

58
00:04:19,431 --> 00:04:20,264
What killed her?

59
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:21,100
Hemorrhage.

60
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:22,475
TB, I'd say.

61
00:04:22,476 --> 00:04:23,726
What's her name, Maggie?

62
00:04:23,727 --> 00:04:25,311
Rosita.

63
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:26,396
Rosita what?

64
00:04:26,397 --> 00:04:28,064
Rosita Jean something.

65
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:29,399
It's a French name.

66
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,359
You can look at it on the register.

67
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,193
It's there.

68
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:33,028
How long has she been sick?

69
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:35,863
Well, she was sick when she came.

70
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:36,989
Find anything around?

71
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,159
Not so much as a letter.

72
00:04:40,786 --> 00:04:42,036
That's funny.

73
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:43,454
Isn't it?

74
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:45,248
What's going on, Adams?

75
00:04:45,249 --> 00:04:46,999
You know anything about this, do you?

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,545
Now what would I know
about Rosita Whosis?

77
00:04:50,546 --> 00:04:52,631
Careful with your hand.

78
00:04:55,426 --> 00:04:57,093
How old do you think she is, Jack?

79
00:04:57,094 --> 00:04:58,093
25, 26.

80
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,556
Not much more than a youngster.

81
00:05:01,557 --> 00:05:03,725
Good looking, too, even like this.

82
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:06,519
Eight years ago she'd have
made Minerva look like a dog.

83
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,687
Who's Minerva?

84
00:05:07,688 --> 00:05:08,855
Oh, just a friend of mine.

85
00:05:08,856 --> 00:05:09,815
What happens to her now?

86
00:05:09,816 --> 00:05:13,192
Morgue for three days,
unless somebody identifies her.

87
00:05:13,193 --> 00:05:14,902
Eight years.

88
00:05:14,903 --> 00:05:16,487
Funny, I wonder what happened

89
00:05:16,488 --> 00:05:19,575
to this one during those eight years.

90
00:05:23,704 --> 00:05:24,829
I can't get anything.

91
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,248
Nobody ever heard of the dame.

92
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:28,833
Somebody has to.

93
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:30,002
Pick a number.

94
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:38,927
Now, look!

95
00:05:38,928 --> 00:05:41,053
I don't know any Rosita.

96
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:43,347
And secondly, I wouldn't
touch her dead or alive

97
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:45,391
with a 10 foot pole.

98
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:46,393
Now lay off!

99
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:49,730
Poor girl.

100
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:52,107
Yes, I recall her.

101
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,860
She visited a patient
here, oh, some time ago.

102
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:57,737
She used to come in and see me.

103
00:05:57,738 --> 00:05:59,614
A little dark-haired girl.

104
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:01,657
A very sweet child.

105
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:02,534
I'm so sorry.

106
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:04,327
Do you remember
whom she visited, sister?

107
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:05,287
I'm afraid not.

108
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:07,538
I only remember her because of our talks.

109
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:08,415
Did you know her family?

110
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,167
No, I don't think she ever mentioned.

111
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:12,919
Is there anything I can do?

112
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,961
We'll let you know.

113
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:15,464
Thank you, sister.

114
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:28,142
- Yes?
- Hello, G.G.?

115
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:30,645
- Yes?
- This is Adams.

116
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:32,980
- Who?
- Adams from The Journal.

117
00:06:32,981 --> 00:06:34,065
We're trying to learn-

118
00:06:34,066 --> 00:06:36,567
How did you get my private number?

119
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:39,695
If you'll answer a few
questions, I might tell you.

120
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:41,739
- Well?
- We'd like to learn

121
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,910
what you can tell us
about Rosita Jean D'Ur.

122
00:06:45,911 --> 00:06:47,829
I can tell you nothing.

123
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,914
I'm afraid that's not quite true.

124
00:06:49,915 --> 00:06:50,749
Why do you ask?

125
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,959
She was found dead this morning.

126
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,378
In a cheap hotel.

127
00:06:57,923 --> 00:06:58,757
Hello?

128
00:06:58,758 --> 00:07:01,217
If The Journal or any other
newspaper connects my name

129
00:07:01,218 --> 00:07:02,927
with this woman, I'll sue them.

130
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:05,763
Is that clear, Mr. Adams?

131
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:10,601
Hey, who's the big shot
whose initials are G.G.T.?

132
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:12,144
G.G. who?

133
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:14,313
- Never heard of him, Ed.
- Hey, it could be Temple.

134
00:07:14,314 --> 00:07:15,148
Who?

135
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:17,484
G.G. Temple, vice-president
of the Ayckroyd Trust.

136
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:18,776
Get me the Ayckroyd Trust.

137
00:07:18,777 --> 00:07:19,610
Gribbe wants you.

138
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:20,444
Yeah, okay.

139
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:21,237
He's a big shot, you know.

140
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:22,196
A foreign handicapped man.

141
00:07:22,197 --> 00:07:23,031
Rough.

142
00:07:23,032 --> 00:07:24,949
- All kinds of dough.
- Ayckroyd Trust.

143
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,242
Mr. Temple, please.

144
00:07:26,243 --> 00:07:29,203
- Hey, what is all this?
- Mr. Temple's office.

145
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:30,830
I'd like to speak to Mr. Temple.

146
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:32,583
This is the District Attorney's office.

147
00:07:32,624 --> 00:07:35,126
- Just a moment, please.
- Hello?

148
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:37,003
- Hello, Mr. Temple?
- Yes.

149
00:07:37,004 --> 00:07:39,714
Mr. Temple, we're trying
to check on the death of-

150
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:42,008
Adams, get off the ribbon

151
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:43,634
and go over to the Board of Trade.

152
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:45,678
Gribbe, when you were
younger and not so fat-

153
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:47,847
There's a rumor that
Winchester's resigned.

154
00:07:47,848 --> 00:07:50,057
Did you ever ask clean questions?

155
00:07:50,058 --> 00:07:52,643
What are you talking about?

156
00:07:52,644 --> 00:07:54,980
Here, take a look at this.

157
00:07:56,481 --> 00:07:59,775
Little dark-haired girl
who looked so sweet.

158
00:07:59,776 --> 00:08:01,777
How did you ever come to this?

159
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:04,655
The police are searching
today for the family or friends

160
00:08:04,656 --> 00:08:07,158
of a beautiful 26-year-old girl who...

161
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:09,410
Run 100 words about the pity of it all.

162
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:12,246
Doesn't look like much to me.

163
00:08:12,247 --> 00:08:15,207
With the Vice-president
of the Ayckroyd Trust in it?

164
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,752
With a nun who said she was
a very sweet little girl,

165
00:08:17,753 --> 00:08:19,795
and with a hoodlum who
spits over the phone

166
00:08:19,796 --> 00:08:21,964
every time you mention her name.

167
00:08:21,965 --> 00:08:23,507
Put it all together, what do you got?

168
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:27,094
I wonder what kind of
a girl she really was.

169
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:28,096
For you, Ed.

170
00:08:28,138 --> 00:08:29,555
Where did you get this?

171
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:30,848
I borrowed it.

172
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:32,934
- Yeah.
- I got your Superior number.

173
00:08:32,935 --> 00:08:34,685
Oh, put it on.

174
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:37,271
- Hello?
- Hello, Tommy?

175
00:08:37,272 --> 00:08:39,398
Yes, who is this?

176
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:40,942
A friend of Rosita's.

177
00:08:40,943 --> 00:08:42,568
Oh.

178
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:45,988
I'd like to see you and talk to you.

179
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:46,988
Oh.

180
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:50,576
This isn't the police, is it?

181
00:08:50,577 --> 00:08:52,244
No, it's just a friend.

182
00:08:52,245 --> 00:08:53,829
Is she in trouble?

183
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,457
She died this morning, Tommy.

184
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:00,627
Hello?

185
00:09:01,546 --> 00:09:04,716
Tommy!

186
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:09,262
How did she...

187
00:09:10,514 --> 00:09:11,513
T.B.

188
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:16,185
Will you identify the body?

189
00:09:16,186 --> 00:09:17,020
Yes.

190
00:09:17,021 --> 00:09:19,105
Can you be at the Morgue at six?

191
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:20,105
Yes.

192
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:23,734
Ask for Adams, Ed Adams.

193
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:24,820
You got that?

194
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:27,071
Good bye.

195
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:27,906
I don't know.

196
00:09:27,907 --> 00:09:29,615
If you got a story, we probably
couldn't print it anyway.

197
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:32,451
Don't waste too much time on it.

198
00:09:32,452 --> 00:09:33,286
Hey, some fun.

199
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:34,704
- This is a dame.
- Mandor.

200
00:09:34,705 --> 00:09:36,247
May I speak to Belle, please?

201
00:09:36,248 --> 00:09:37,248
- Belle who?
- What's the matter,

202
00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:38,083
you got so many Belles there

203
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:39,125
you need an index or something?

204
00:09:39,126 --> 00:09:40,960
Well don't get so tough about it!

205
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:42,963
See who this party is.

206
00:09:43,797 --> 00:09:44,881
Hello, Belle?

207
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:47,091
Yes.

208
00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:50,386
It's a friend of Rosita's.

209
00:09:50,387 --> 00:09:51,346
Rosita?

210
00:09:51,347 --> 00:09:52,722
Don't you remember?

211
00:09:52,723 --> 00:09:55,599
A pretty dark-haired little girl.

212
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,226
Well, I don't know.

213
00:09:57,227 --> 00:09:59,145
Where does she live?

214
00:09:59,146 --> 00:10:01,230
She died this morning, Belle.

215
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:03,816
That's why I'm calling.

216
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,192
Died?

217
00:10:05,193 --> 00:10:06,403
She couldn't...

218
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:09,488
I can't talk to you now.

219
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:10,489
I have to go out.

220
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,783
Now look, you're not
gonna get into any trouble.

221
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:13,951
I don't know her.

222
00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:15,578
I never heard of her.

223
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:16,830
Leave me alone!

224
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:21,208
- Mandor.
- Look, operator,

225
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:22,710
there's five bucks in it for
you if you find out where Belle

226
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:25,171
is going when she goes out.

227
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:26,423
I'll be right over.

228
00:10:26,465 --> 00:10:27,798
Hey, there's nobody
there by the name of Purdy.

229
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,216
It's a Marcia Grantland.

230
00:10:29,217 --> 00:10:30,051
I can't get hold of her.

231
00:10:30,052 --> 00:10:31,011
There seems to be a party going on.

232
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:33,345
6900, Albion, apartment C.

233
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:34,765
N.Y., New York.

234
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,391
Ask what they have on those guys.

235
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:38,559
What am I, a stooge?

236
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,019
Hey, where are you going?

237
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,020
Out to have fun.

238
00:10:44,107 --> 00:10:45,691
Mandor Hotel.

239
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:47,818
What did you do to
our little Belle, son?

240
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:48,653
Where'd she go?

241
00:10:48,654 --> 00:10:50,780
She didn't say.

242
00:10:50,781 --> 00:10:51,822
Thanks.

243
00:10:51,823 --> 00:10:52,948
What did you say to her?

244
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:53,784
Why?

245
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:55,201
She checked out.

246
00:10:55,202 --> 00:10:56,285
How long did she live here?

247
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:57,828
Over a year.

248
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:58,662
Take all of her things?

249
00:10:58,663 --> 00:10:59,497
A bag.

250
00:10:59,498 --> 00:11:00,373
Will send for the rest.

251
00:11:00,374 --> 00:11:02,291
You must be dynamite.

252
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:03,959
Yeah, I must be.

253
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,087
I must be loaded.

254
00:11:19,392 --> 00:11:20,227
Why, hello!

255
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:21,393
Come on in.

256
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:22,229
Thank you.

257
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,896
Are you a friend of
Hazel's or of George's?

258
00:11:23,897 --> 00:11:26,107
Er, George, good old George.

259
00:11:26,108 --> 00:11:27,733
Throw your hat anywhere.

260
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:28,609
Thank you.

261
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,486
We're about to cut the cake.

262
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:31,403
I wouldn't miss that for the world.

263
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:34,490
- See you later.
- Hey, where's your glass?

264
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:36,534
I just came in.

265
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:38,327
Well, thank you very much.

266
00:11:38,328 --> 00:11:39,246
Here you are.

267
00:11:39,247 --> 00:11:40,496
Oh, thank you.

268
00:11:40,497 --> 00:11:42,039
Well, it's like everybody showed.

269
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,583
I guess nobody could
believe it until they saw it.

270
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:47,378
I still don't believe it.

271
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:48,963
Here's to you.

272
00:11:48,964 --> 00:11:50,422
Thanks.

273
00:11:50,423 --> 00:11:52,091
Who are you?

274
00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:53,634
Ed Adams.

275
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:55,219
Hello, Ed.

276
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,345
Hello?

277
00:11:56,346 --> 00:11:57,596
Leona.

278
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:58,849
Hello, Leona.

279
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:02,101
Who are you a friend of?

280
00:12:02,102 --> 00:12:03,519
George's.

281
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,896
Oh, George has been holding out.

282
00:12:05,897 --> 00:12:08,900
I mean, are you looking for anybody?

283
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:11,318
Marcia Grantland.

284
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:13,112
It would be Marcia.

285
00:12:13,113 --> 00:12:14,780
Wouldn't it?

286
00:12:14,781 --> 00:12:16,240
You want me to find her?

287
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:17,741
No, not right now.

288
00:12:17,742 --> 00:12:18,741
Well!

289
00:12:19,536 --> 00:12:20,787
Have some more.

290
00:12:21,872 --> 00:12:24,331
Marcia's been holding out, too.

291
00:12:24,332 --> 00:12:26,208
Can't say that I blame her.

292
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:28,502
She is a bit secretive sometimes.

293
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:30,172
Yeah, that's true.

294
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:36,468
I don't think she'd like
you looking at me like that.

295
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:37,888
Leona, darling.

296
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:39,972
Hello, Janet.

297
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:42,099
Darling, what do you think about Hazel?

298
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,019
She finally made it, didn't she?

299
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,312
Oh, my goodness!

300
00:12:46,313 --> 00:12:47,813
You've just been decorated.

301
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:48,648
Pardon me.

302
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:51,442
Let's move out of here
before we get trampled.

303
00:12:51,443 --> 00:12:52,276
Where can we go?

304
00:12:52,277 --> 00:12:53,236
I'd like to talk to you.

305
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:54,571
Well, come on.

306
00:12:58,366 --> 00:12:59,365
Here.

307
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:04,079
Leona?

308
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,497
Yes?

309
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:07,250
Do you know Rosita?

310
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:09,419
Who?

311
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,711
Rosita Jean D'Ur.

312
00:13:10,712 --> 00:13:13,130
I little dark-haired girl.

313
00:13:13,131 --> 00:13:15,841
You do get around, don't you?

314
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:18,594
No, I'm just checking out what you know.

315
00:13:18,595 --> 00:13:20,012
Are you?

316
00:13:20,013 --> 00:13:21,847
Are you, really?

317
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:23,933
Your face is flushed, baby.

318
00:13:23,934 --> 00:13:25,559
All right.

319
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,770
I guess I had it coming to me.

320
00:13:27,771 --> 00:13:28,979
I'm a little dizzy.

321
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,858
I don't get along very
well with champagne.

322
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:36,904
And you shouldn't have
looked at me like that.

323
00:13:36,905 --> 00:13:39,240
Well, wait a minute.

324
00:13:40,325 --> 00:13:41,324
Sorry.

325
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:43,495
Have fun, kiddies.

326
00:13:43,496 --> 00:13:44,663
Don't mind me.

327
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:51,877
What's the matter?

328
00:13:51,878 --> 00:13:53,629
That was Marcia Grantland.

329
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,799
Your girlfriend, remember?

330
00:13:56,633 --> 00:13:57,801
Do you mind?

331
00:13:58,718 --> 00:14:00,177
Who are you, Ed?

332
00:14:00,178 --> 00:14:01,762
I'm a reporter.

333
00:14:01,763 --> 00:14:03,931
Do you want to tell me about it?

334
00:14:03,932 --> 00:14:06,308
You could come along with me.

335
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:07,351
Where?

336
00:14:07,352 --> 00:14:10,105
Why not see where it takes you?

337
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:12,438
Hi-ho!

338
00:14:15,652 --> 00:14:18,112
Come on, now, drink your coffee.

339
00:14:18,113 --> 00:14:19,030
Don't you think a dash of brandy

340
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:21,532
would make it a bit more piquant?

341
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:24,493
Don't you think you'd
better get sober first?

342
00:14:24,494 --> 00:14:27,955
I have been misinformed
about newspapermen.

343
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:30,374
Look, I want you with a clear
head and a working memory.

344
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:32,751
But I've told you everything I know.

345
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:36,880
I only met Rosita twice or
three times at parties a couple

346
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:38,340
of years ago.

347
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:39,842
Come on, drink your coffee.

348
00:14:39,843 --> 00:14:42,261
Well, anyway, as a
reporter you're a dud.

349
00:14:42,262 --> 00:14:46,432
Why, I could have gotten
much more out of me.

350
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:48,642
The guy you asked for just came in.

351
00:14:48,643 --> 00:14:49,768
John Spingler?

352
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:51,979
At the end of the bar.

353
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,689
As a matter of fact
you should be plying me

354
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,276
with liquor and loosening me up.

355
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:00,154
- Spingler?
- Yeah.

356
00:15:00,155 --> 00:15:01,822
Did you hear about Rosita?

357
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:03,157
What about her?

358
00:15:03,158 --> 00:15:03,991
She's dead.

359
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:04,826
Something?

360
00:15:04,827 --> 00:15:06,702
No, thanks.

361
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:07,536
That's too bad.

362
00:15:07,537 --> 00:15:08,413
How?

363
00:15:08,414 --> 00:15:09,705
T.B.

364
00:15:09,706 --> 00:15:10,623
I'm from The Journal.

365
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:12,541
We're trying to find
somebody who can tell us

366
00:15:12,542 --> 00:15:13,584
something about her.

367
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:14,419
Why?

368
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,961
So we can notify her family.

369
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:17,129
They want to bury her.

370
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:17,964
I don't know her.

371
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:22,469
But I'll take her to her
funeral if you keep me quiet.

372
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:38,067
I'll pick you up between nine and 10.

373
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:40,069
Ed, are all reporters this busy?

374
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,197
Or is it just those
interested in dead people?

375
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:44,656
10:30 at the latest.

376
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:47,076
Then we'll try a little
of that loosening up.

377
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:48,745
See you later, baby.

378
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:12,601
Yeah?

379
00:16:12,602 --> 00:16:14,353
I wanna see Solly Wellman.

380
00:16:14,354 --> 00:16:16,188
Who are you?

381
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:17,941
Why don't you stop?

382
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:22,778
Hello, Solly.

383
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:25,114
I'm Adams from The Journal.

384
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:25,949
Mm-hmm.

385
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,074
What do you want?

386
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:29,451
I want to find out where
Rosita Jean D'Ur came from.

387
00:16:29,452 --> 00:16:31,954
We'd like to send her home.

388
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:33,372
What have I got to do with that?

389
00:16:33,373 --> 00:16:35,290
Well, you know her.

390
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,500
Who says so?

391
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:37,960
She does.

392
00:16:37,961 --> 00:16:39,044
What did she say?

393
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:42,214
She said, "If anything happens
to me, get a hold of Solly.

394
00:16:42,215 --> 00:16:44,716
He'll know what to do."

395
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:46,593
Who did she say it to?

396
00:16:46,594 --> 00:16:49,221
- Me.
- You're a liar.

397
00:16:49,222 --> 00:16:50,682
How do you know?

398
00:16:51,766 --> 00:16:55,145
Try again.

399
00:16:57,021 --> 00:17:00,023
Okay, Solly, I'll level with you.

400
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:01,192
Rosita's dead.

401
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:04,278
If you give us a lead and identify her,

402
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:06,697
she'll be buried and sent out of town.

403
00:17:06,698 --> 00:17:09,616
The cops will forget about everything.

404
00:17:09,617 --> 00:17:12,369
Otherwise, if she isn't identified

405
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,204
and the body isn't claimed,

406
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:16,458
they're gonna keep looking.

407
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:20,169
What killed her?

408
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,003
Hemorrhage.

409
00:17:21,004 --> 00:17:21,838
T.B.

410
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,255
- All alone?
- Sure.

411
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:25,257
There's no trouble about it there.

412
00:17:25,258 --> 00:17:28,594
We'd just like to notify her folks.

413
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:30,512
She hasn't any folks.

414
00:17:30,513 --> 00:17:33,474
If we were sure of that we'd quit.

415
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:36,018
How long did you know her?

416
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:37,436
A couple of years.

417
00:17:37,437 --> 00:17:39,771
Remember the first time you met her?

418
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:41,190
Yeah.

419
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:43,400
She was a sweet kid, wasn't she?

420
00:17:43,401 --> 00:17:44,400
Yeah.

421
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:49,156
One of the most
beautiful girls I ever saw.

422
00:17:49,157 --> 00:17:50,449
Seeing her lying there

423
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,703
in that cheap flea-bitten hotel, alone.

424
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:58,875
Who threw her to the wolves, Solly?

425
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:06,047
Adams!

426
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,677
That's enough.

427
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,973
Some other time when
you check that artillery.

428
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:16,934
Get this, Adams.

429
00:18:16,935 --> 00:18:18,560
I don't know Rosita.

430
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:19,895
I never heard of her.

431
00:18:19,896 --> 00:18:21,730
If I were you, you didn't either.

432
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:22,564
Drop it.

433
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:23,398
Forget it.

434
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:24,358
She's poison.

435
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,358
Go!

436
00:18:38,498 --> 00:18:40,416
Ed, Howard wants you.

437
00:18:46,673 --> 00:18:49,424
Hello, Ed.

438
00:18:49,425 --> 00:18:50,424
Hi.

439
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:52,636
What does Howard want?

440
00:18:52,637 --> 00:18:55,430
I can't keep up with
a genius like yourself.

441
00:18:55,431 --> 00:18:57,015
But you've done something.

442
00:18:57,016 --> 00:18:59,643
There's a detective and
G.G. Temple in there.

443
00:18:59,644 --> 00:19:00,603
Temple?

444
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:03,605
Hey, watch out for this for me, will you?

445
00:19:03,606 --> 00:19:04,898
Just in case I get pinched or have

446
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:07,192
to run out of here too fast to pick it up.

447
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:08,528
All right, Ed.

448
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:12,697
Come in.

449
00:19:14,242 --> 00:19:15,660
Oh, hello, Adams.

450
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:19,788
You know both these gentlemen.

451
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:21,123
Yes, I think so.

452
00:19:21,124 --> 00:19:22,541
Mr. Temple has just been telling me

453
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:25,085
about a phone call he had from you.

454
00:19:25,086 --> 00:19:26,086
Yes, sir.

455
00:19:26,087 --> 00:19:28,589
He's also been explaining
that his connection

456
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,550
with this Jean D'Ur woman
was entirely respectable.

457
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:34,219
He told the police all he knows about her.

458
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,096
Yes, sir.

459
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:36,638
Where are you getting
your information, Ed?

460
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:39,641
How did you learn that
Mr. Temple knew this girl?

461
00:19:39,642 --> 00:19:40,642
I don't think it's anybody's business

462
00:19:40,643 --> 00:19:43,186
how a reporter gets his information.

463
00:19:43,187 --> 00:19:45,772
There's no crime involved in this case.

464
00:19:45,773 --> 00:19:46,940
As far as I know.

465
00:19:46,941 --> 00:19:48,609
They're trying to identify the girl.

466
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,735
Well, so am I, boss.

467
00:19:49,736 --> 00:19:50,777
It happens to by our business.

468
00:19:50,778 --> 00:19:52,446
And it happens to be mine also.

469
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,197
Your business as I understand it is

470
00:19:54,198 --> 00:19:55,407
to write the news factually.

471
00:19:55,408 --> 00:19:58,160
Not a lot of irresponsible insinuations.

472
00:19:58,161 --> 00:20:00,037
I haven't written
anything yet, Mr. Temple,

473
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:02,831
except the simple story of a girl's death.

474
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:06,251
Do you intend to
connect me with this girl?

475
00:20:06,252 --> 00:20:07,544
That depends.

476
00:20:07,545 --> 00:20:10,422
It's obviously factual, as
you put it, that you knew her.

477
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:12,591
It's also obviously factual
that you're scared out

478
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:14,301
of your pants or you wouldn't be here.

479
00:20:14,302 --> 00:20:15,720
Adams!

480
00:20:16,804 --> 00:20:17,929
Okay, boss.

481
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,351
Why are you so interested in this girl?

482
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:24,603
Simply routine.

483
00:20:24,604 --> 00:20:28,649
A kid dies alone in a cheap
hotel, without friends,

484
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,610
relatives or anyone caring
whether she's buried in a grave

485
00:20:31,611 --> 00:20:33,070
or in an ash-can.

486
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:35,781
That's all the story
there is to it, at first.

487
00:20:35,782 --> 00:20:39,368
Just a simple little human interest yarn.

488
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:41,203
Then you start bouncing
the corpse down the street

489
00:20:41,204 --> 00:20:44,373
and suddenly you have the
whole place all to yourself.

490
00:20:44,374 --> 00:20:46,166
That interests me.

491
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:49,044
How did you get
Mr. Temple's private number?

492
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:50,879
Maybe he goes around
writing it on the walls

493
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,964
of pay stations.

494
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:54,257
Ed, I know you too well.

495
00:20:54,258 --> 00:20:57,219
You don't fool around with
a little thing like this,

496
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,388
unless you've got something.

497
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:00,388
What is it?

498
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:02,308
Sorry.

499
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:04,518
You will tell us, Ed.

500
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:05,811
Really?

501
00:21:05,812 --> 00:21:07,229
Adams, you know perfectly well

502
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,814
that The Journal can't have any part

503
00:21:08,815 --> 00:21:11,066
in the withholding of evidence.

504
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:11,901
I know that, sir.

505
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:13,151
Unless you really have something.

506
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:14,070
We drop it.

507
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:16,947
Simply because this girl once
knew a few prominent people,

508
00:21:16,948 --> 00:21:18,532
So we forget that when you mention

509
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:20,409
the name Rosita Jean
D'Ur people run and hide,

510
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,952
check out of hotels,

511
00:21:21,953 --> 00:21:23,870
and we aren't even curious
about why they do that.

512
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:25,080
Who runs and hides?

513
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:26,039
Anyone I ask about her.

514
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,874
Look at Temple.

515
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:27,916
Why is he here?

516
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:29,835
Because he's afraid he might
get his name might be linked up

517
00:21:29,836 --> 00:21:32,087
with some dame nobody ever heard of?

518
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:33,338
Don't be silly.

519
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:34,339
How do you find these people?

520
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:37,092
- I have visions.
- Adams!

521
00:21:37,093 --> 00:21:38,510
Look, Mr. Howard.

522
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:40,262
I don't like privileged people.

523
00:21:40,263 --> 00:21:42,472
And I don't like being kicked around.

524
00:21:42,473 --> 00:21:44,307
So far I've just been digging.

525
00:21:44,308 --> 00:21:46,977
But I'm beginning to get a
pretty dirty smell in both

526
00:21:46,978 --> 00:21:47,937
of my nostrils.

527
00:21:47,938 --> 00:21:49,813
Ed, without the paper
behind you you're no better

528
00:21:49,814 --> 00:21:51,273
than any other witness.

529
00:21:51,274 --> 00:21:53,483
Okay, if you want to look
like the big clown of all times,

530
00:21:53,484 --> 00:21:54,901
go ahead, pinch me.

531
00:21:54,902 --> 00:21:57,779
I'll talk to you later, Adams.

532
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,779
Yes, sir.

533
00:22:02,452 --> 00:22:04,619
Well, Howard, if you can't control

534
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,538
this man perhaps the publisher can.

535
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,626
- Yes?
- Boss, that was no act.

536
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:13,378
I meant what I said.

537
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:14,880
Give me a break, will you?

538
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:16,798
Stall them until I can talk to you.

539
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,759
Ed, I'm afraid I'll have

540
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,427
to break the appointment, Miss Lee.

541
00:22:20,428 --> 00:22:23,221
Yeah, I'm going to be a bit
busy here for some time.

542
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:24,474
Thanks, boss.

543
00:22:37,487 --> 00:22:39,322
It's Rosita, isn't it?

544
00:22:40,281 --> 00:22:41,280
Yes.

545
00:22:42,158 --> 00:22:43,157
Thanks.

546
00:22:48,247 --> 00:22:50,874
Look, Tommy, I can get names,
dates and facts easily,

547
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:53,043
enough to write a story.

548
00:22:53,044 --> 00:22:56,880
But that's not going to
tell Rosita's side of it.

549
00:22:56,881 --> 00:22:58,924
On the other hand, if you talk a little,

550
00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:01,510
I'll give her every break I can.

551
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:06,348
How about the chance to
make her warm, human, alive?

552
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:08,517
Instead of a dame with the wrong people.

553
00:23:08,518 --> 00:23:11,102
How do I know I can trust you?

554
00:23:11,103 --> 00:23:15,525
I saw her just a few
minutes after she died, Tommy.

555
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,736
She was your sister, wasn't she?

556
00:23:19,737 --> 00:23:21,363
Yes.

557
00:23:21,364 --> 00:23:23,490
Were you born here in Chicago?

558
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:24,658
Yes.

559
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:25,992
Live here all your life?

560
00:23:25,993 --> 00:23:30,748
No, my father died when we
were kids and we moved away.

561
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:34,334
Amarillo, Texas.

562
00:23:34,335 --> 00:23:36,503
How did you know?

563
00:23:36,504 --> 00:23:38,755
Is your mother still alive, Tommy?

564
00:23:38,756 --> 00:23:40,340
No.

565
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:42,927
Have you a picture of Rosita?

566
00:23:46,764 --> 00:23:50,100
This was taken, oh, years ago.

567
00:23:50,101 --> 00:23:52,102
Just before she was married.

568
00:23:54,772 --> 00:23:56,106
Tell me about Amarillo.

569
00:23:56,107 --> 00:23:59,943
There isn't much, we had a
little ranch outside of town.

570
00:23:59,944 --> 00:24:01,486
Rosita didn't like it there.

571
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:02,572
She ran away.

572
00:24:03,865 --> 00:24:06,032
She was only about 17.

573
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:06,993
My mother and I were crazy,

574
00:24:06,994 --> 00:24:09,160
wondering and worrying about her.

575
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:10,579
Then we got a letter from her.

576
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,663
She was in San Francisco.

577
00:24:11,664 --> 00:24:13,248
She had a job there.

578
00:24:13,249 --> 00:24:16,793
That's where this picture
was taken in Frisco.

579
00:24:16,794 --> 00:24:20,422
I went up there as soon
as we heard from her.

580
00:24:20,423 --> 00:24:23,134
She was a pretty kid, wasn't she?

581
00:24:24,844 --> 00:24:26,261
More than that.

582
00:24:26,262 --> 00:24:28,388
There was something about her, always.

583
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:30,474
I don't know what it was.

584
00:24:31,475 --> 00:24:34,895
Sort of a challenge
to every man she'd meet.

585
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:37,565
But then, she looked so young,

586
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:42,068
that's what hit me first when I found her.

587
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:42,903
In Frisco?

588
00:24:42,904 --> 00:24:43,863
Yeah.

589
00:24:43,864 --> 00:24:48,283
Her boarding house people sent
me to a roller-skating rink.

590
00:24:48,284 --> 00:24:51,077
A big place down in Divisadero Street.

591
00:24:51,078 --> 00:24:53,496
She wasn't hard to pick out in the crowd.

592
00:24:53,497 --> 00:24:56,499
You know how you can spot
someone that you're fond of.

593
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,293
She was just 18 then.

594
00:24:58,294 --> 00:24:59,836
She wore her hair like that.

595
00:24:59,837 --> 00:25:01,838
She was with Paul Jean D'Ur.

596
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:04,132
I didn't know who he was then,
of course, and I was so glad

597
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:06,551
to see her I didn't pay much attention.

598
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:09,387
I didn't even think until
later how she smiled at him,

599
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:11,431
hung on to his arm like
there were no one else

600
00:25:11,432 --> 00:25:13,851
in the building but that guy.

601
00:25:14,769 --> 00:25:17,103
Oh, Paul isn't it wonderful?

602
00:25:17,104 --> 00:25:17,939
What?

603
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,023
Everything.

604
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:22,860
I'm so happy it scares me.

605
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:26,321
Well, suppose being as lonely

606
00:25:26,322 --> 00:25:28,573
as you were you'd met someone else.

607
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:30,742
It could have happened, you know?

608
00:25:30,743 --> 00:25:33,536
What would have gone on then?

609
00:25:33,537 --> 00:25:34,372
Nothing.

610
00:25:34,373 --> 00:25:36,122
A complete zero.

611
00:25:36,123 --> 00:25:36,916
That's my point.

612
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:37,999
Zero, zero, zero.

613
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,418
Stop talking like an architect.

614
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:41,253
Well.

615
00:25:41,254 --> 00:25:43,088
Tell me we're going to be happy.

616
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:45,215
We're going to be happy.

617
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,552
Tell me everything's going to be fine.

618
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:53,264
You're the only thing
in the world, Rosita.

619
00:25:53,265 --> 00:25:54,264
Trust me.

620
00:25:55,226 --> 00:25:56,434
I do.

621
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,689
Rosita!

622
00:26:01,315 --> 00:26:02,983
Tommy!

623
00:26:02,984 --> 00:26:04,109
Tommy!

624
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,860
Oh, I don't believe it.

625
00:26:05,861 --> 00:26:07,320
Why didn't you let me know?

626
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:08,155
How are you?

627
00:26:08,156 --> 00:26:09,489
Oh, Tommy, I'm fine.

628
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,366
Mom's all right?

629
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:11,409
Oh, sure, sure.

630
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,575
You're worried about me.

631
00:26:12,576 --> 00:26:14,369
Well, naturally.

632
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,620
Thanks, Tommy.

633
00:26:15,621 --> 00:26:18,999
Oh, thanks for your letter and for coming.

634
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,167
Oh, Paul, this is my brother.

635
00:26:21,168 --> 00:26:22,794
Paul Jean D'Ur.

636
00:26:22,795 --> 00:26:23,628
Hello.

637
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:24,505
He seemed like a nice enough fellow

638
00:26:24,506 --> 00:26:26,756
and I had nothing against him really, but,

639
00:26:26,757 --> 00:26:28,633
it hit me hard when she
said they were going

640
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:30,468
to be married the next Sunday.

641
00:26:30,469 --> 00:26:34,890
I don't know why, but I had
a funny feeling about it.

642
00:26:37,768 --> 00:26:39,811
- Good night.
- Good night.

643
00:26:42,606 --> 00:26:45,984
You're not asking me, you've
made up your mind already.

644
00:26:45,985 --> 00:26:49,487
Tommy, everything in the
world is tied up here for me.

645
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:52,615
He's fine and good, I'm sure.

646
00:26:52,616 --> 00:26:56,119
We've talked and talked,
I know all about him.

647
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,998
We found that we want the same things.

648
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:00,958
Look.

649
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:03,043
Remember the fan you gave me?

650
00:27:03,044 --> 00:27:04,753
He painted it for me.

651
00:27:04,754 --> 00:27:06,755
Isn't it beautiful?

652
00:27:06,756 --> 00:27:07,964
He wanted to be an artist.

653
00:27:07,965 --> 00:27:09,632
He tried very hard.

654
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:11,885
But he says he hasn't got it.

655
00:27:11,886 --> 00:27:14,345
That hurt him terribly.

656
00:27:14,346 --> 00:27:16,556
I felt so sorry for him.

657
00:27:16,557 --> 00:27:18,892
What's this job of his in New York?

658
00:27:18,893 --> 00:27:20,518
In an architect's office.

659
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,188
He's a draughtsman now,
but he'll be an architect.

660
00:27:23,189 --> 00:27:24,774
He'll take Paul on.

661
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:29,278
Tommy, we're awfully in love.

662
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:31,947
We need each other.

663
00:27:34,241 --> 00:27:35,700
Good luck, kid.

664
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:38,745
She said she wanted an
impressive ceremony.

665
00:27:38,746 --> 00:27:39,871
I guess it was.

666
00:27:39,872 --> 00:27:41,498
It was a big church.

667
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:43,124
You should have seen Rosita.

668
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:44,209
She looked like she thought no one

669
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,544
had ever gotten married before.

670
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:49,964
Well, we piled her into
that junk he called his car.

671
00:27:49,965 --> 00:27:52,801
I honestly didn't think
they'd make the Bay Bridge.

672
00:27:52,802 --> 00:27:53,761
But it didn't worry them.

673
00:27:53,762 --> 00:27:56,930
They didn't have any money,
that didn't worry them either.

674
00:27:59,475 --> 00:28:01,476
Paul did pretty well in New York.

675
00:28:01,477 --> 00:28:05,563
I had a job traveling but I'd
hear from them occasionally.

676
00:28:05,564 --> 00:28:06,563
And then...

677
00:28:07,316 --> 00:28:08,316
Yes?

678
00:28:08,317 --> 00:28:11,486
Paul was killed in
an automobile accident.

679
00:28:11,487 --> 00:28:12,737
When was that?

680
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:14,739
About four years ago.

681
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,865
Did they have any children?

682
00:28:15,866 --> 00:28:16,865
No.

683
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:19,702
If they had, it might
have been different.

684
00:28:19,703 --> 00:28:22,413
Something had happened
between them before he died.

685
00:28:22,414 --> 00:28:23,706
I don't know what it was.

686
00:28:23,707 --> 00:28:26,584
She never talked about it.

687
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:28,128
Then she came here.

688
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:30,130
But she stayed pretty much to herself.

689
00:28:30,131 --> 00:28:34,092
She had jobs in a movie house, hat store,

690
00:28:34,093 --> 00:28:36,761
But they never lasted long.

691
00:28:36,762 --> 00:28:38,681
Did she usually quit?

692
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:44,394
There always seemed to
be the wrong guy around.

693
00:28:44,395 --> 00:28:47,188
Then, then she got a job in an art store.

694
00:28:47,189 --> 00:28:48,023
She liked that.

695
00:28:48,024 --> 00:28:50,609
She knew a lot about paintings.

696
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:56,198
I, I can't tell you any more.

697
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,910
Tommy, it's better
than my trying to guess.

698
00:29:00,911 --> 00:29:01,953
No.

699
00:29:01,954 --> 00:29:03,037
I can't.

700
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:05,665
Tell me just her side of the story.

701
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:08,168
Did you ever see her here in Chicago?

702
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:09,502
On my birthday.

703
00:29:09,503 --> 00:29:10,461
Always.

704
00:29:10,462 --> 00:29:11,297
She'd never forget it.

705
00:29:11,298 --> 00:29:15,133
Even if I hadn't seen her in a year.

706
00:29:15,134 --> 00:29:16,509
What is it?

707
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,677
I was thinking.

708
00:29:17,678 --> 00:29:20,430
Why don't you get married again?

709
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:22,765
- I'm afraid.
- Why?

710
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:25,226
I'd like you to understand,

711
00:29:25,227 --> 00:29:26,562
but you can't.

712
00:29:26,604 --> 00:29:28,522
But give me a chance.

713
00:29:30,274 --> 00:29:34,485
When you see a marriage
die, Tommy, it's ugly.

714
00:29:34,486 --> 00:29:37,238
When one of you stops being in love,

715
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:39,032
or whatever you want to call it,

716
00:29:39,033 --> 00:29:40,950
If it could just be snuffed out quickly

717
00:29:40,951 --> 00:29:43,786
for you both at the same time,

718
00:29:43,787 --> 00:29:44,872
but it isn't.

719
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:49,334
Cut the cake, Tommy.

720
00:29:52,254 --> 00:29:56,132
Then the next time, this
year, we were both broke.

721
00:29:56,133 --> 00:29:59,010
We'd been laughing about it.

722
00:29:59,011 --> 00:30:02,055
Until I looked up and saw her standing

723
00:30:02,056 --> 00:30:04,724
at the window, looking at the rain.

724
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:06,184
It's not going to let up.

725
00:30:06,185 --> 00:30:09,854
Why don't you let me get
you a room here tonight?

726
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:11,023
Rosita, honey!

727
00:30:11,982 --> 00:30:13,483
What's the matter?

728
00:30:13,484 --> 00:30:16,653
We're such fools, the both of us.

729
00:30:16,654 --> 00:30:18,947
We're too sorry for people.

730
00:30:18,948 --> 00:30:22,200
Our trouble is we see
the other guys' side.

731
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:23,493
Are we weak, Tommy?

732
00:30:23,494 --> 00:30:25,912
Is that what's wrong with us?

733
00:30:25,913 --> 00:30:29,123
Let's spit in their
eyes for a change, huh?

734
00:30:29,124 --> 00:30:32,543
Tommy, why are we
different from other people?

735
00:30:32,544 --> 00:30:35,880
All I ever wanted was a little happiness

736
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:37,840
and someone to love.

737
00:30:37,841 --> 00:30:38,717
We'll go away, honey.

738
00:30:38,718 --> 00:30:41,928
I'll get a new job someplace.

739
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:45,014
I'm tired of running away.

740
00:30:45,015 --> 00:30:47,600
That was the last
time [ talked with her.

741
00:30:47,601 --> 00:30:48,643
But I saw her again.

742
00:30:48,644 --> 00:30:50,144
At least I think I did.

743
00:30:50,145 --> 00:30:53,022
One afternoon on the elevated platform.

744
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:54,482
I didn't recognize her at first.

745
00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:56,192
She looked so tired.

746
00:30:56,193 --> 00:30:57,777
I guess she was ill.

747
00:30:57,778 --> 00:31:00,655
But I'm sure it was Rosita.

748
00:31:00,656 --> 00:31:01,655
Rosita!

749
00:31:04,368 --> 00:31:05,369
Hey, Rosita!

750
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:12,875
She must have heard me.

751
00:31:12,876 --> 00:31:13,669
I don't know.

752
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,086
It was like one of those mixed up things

753
00:31:15,087 --> 00:31:17,088
in a dream where everything's in the way

754
00:31:17,089 --> 00:31:18,965
and you can't get there.

755
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:21,301
If she didn't hear me, it was bad luck.

756
00:31:21,302 --> 00:31:23,387
Just a couple of seconds.

757
00:31:24,471 --> 00:31:26,306
If I could have caught up with her,

758
00:31:26,307 --> 00:31:27,141
I might have been able to-

759
00:31:27,142 --> 00:31:29,600
Ed, Peter's holding a call
for you through the board.

760
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:30,477
Never mind.

761
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:32,478
He said it's important,
about a Rosita somebody.

762
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:34,605
Said to tell you it's juicy.

763
00:31:34,606 --> 00:31:37,317
All right, all right.

764
00:31:37,318 --> 00:31:39,360
Tommy, I'm sorry for her, honestly.

765
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:40,570
Go on, take your call.

766
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:42,447
You don't care what she really was.

767
00:31:42,448 --> 00:31:43,407
All she did was die.

768
00:31:43,408 --> 00:31:45,700
Hasn't she even got a right to do that?

769
00:31:45,701 --> 00:31:46,700
Tommy!

770
00:31:47,995 --> 00:31:48,994
Tommy!

771
00:31:55,711 --> 00:31:56,544
Hello?

772
00:31:56,545 --> 00:31:57,378
Ed?

773
00:31:57,379 --> 00:31:58,212
I got Blacky Franchot.

774
00:31:58,213 --> 00:31:59,048
He just called in.

775
00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:00,798
- You remember him.
- Yeah.

776
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,009
Big shot mobster, about a year or two ago.

777
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:06,012
Yeah, Ed, he won't
talk to anybody but you.

778
00:32:06,013 --> 00:32:09,057
And he's been down to
the morgue to see Rosita.

779
00:32:09,058 --> 00:32:11,476
- All right, put him on.
- Here's your party, Ed.

780
00:32:11,477 --> 00:32:12,852
Hello, Blacky, this is Adams.

781
00:32:12,853 --> 00:32:14,771
You were asking around about Rosita.

782
00:32:14,772 --> 00:32:16,397
I can tell you about her.

783
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:18,399
How soon can you get up here?

784
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,817
- Where?
- 786, Randolph,

785
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:22,153
apartment 5, second floor.

786
00:32:22,154 --> 00:32:24,322
- 20 minutes, 15.
- Hurry!

787
00:33:53,704 --> 00:33:54,703
Blacky!

788
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,375
Blacky, this is Ed Adams.

789
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:01,878
You gotta hold on.

790
00:34:01,879 --> 00:34:02,963
Who did this?

791
00:34:05,424 --> 00:34:08,259
What's this got to do with Rosita?

792
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,428
I loved her.

793
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,430
Who did it, Blacky?

794
00:34:32,201 --> 00:34:35,870
- Journal.
- Hello, give me the desk.

795
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:38,206
- Hello?
- Hello, Gribbe?

796
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:39,373
It's Ed Adams.

797
00:34:39,374 --> 00:34:42,461
- Where are you?
- Blacky Franchot's.

798
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:47,048
He called me, you know about that.

799
00:34:47,049 --> 00:34:47,883
I was late.

800
00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:50,092
Somebody else beat me to it.

801
00:34:50,093 --> 00:34:53,262
They, uh, put a hole in him.

802
00:34:53,263 --> 00:34:55,014
He just copped out.

803
00:34:55,015 --> 00:34:55,891
Langden, get down there.

804
00:34:55,892 --> 00:34:57,683
Boyd, find Paige.

805
00:34:57,684 --> 00:34:59,310
- Did he talk?
- No.

806
00:34:59,311 --> 00:35:01,521
Well, it definitely
links the Rosita dame.

807
00:35:01,522 --> 00:35:03,648
You sure he didn't say anything about her?

808
00:35:03,649 --> 00:35:04,732
- I told you no.
- Well he could a.

809
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:06,734
He could've said he was crazy about her,

810
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:07,694
in his last breath.

811
00:35:07,695 --> 00:35:08,736
Blacky Franchot.

812
00:35:08,737 --> 00:35:09,862
What happened to him?

813
00:35:09,863 --> 00:35:10,696
He was knocked off.

814
00:35:10,697 --> 00:35:11,656
Oh, that's fine.

815
00:35:11,657 --> 00:35:12,491
Get over there.

816
00:35:12,492 --> 00:35:13,950
Take the cameraman with you, and hurry.

817
00:35:13,951 --> 00:35:15,076
Sit right there, Ed.

818
00:35:15,077 --> 00:35:16,912
Pig's on his way with a camera.

819
00:35:16,954 --> 00:35:18,622
Hey, here's Langdon.

820
00:35:28,549 --> 00:35:30,091
Hello, Adams.

821
00:35:30,092 --> 00:35:31,300
Hello, Solly.

822
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:32,300
Sit down.

823
00:35:33,971 --> 00:35:35,346
What's going on?

824
00:35:35,347 --> 00:35:37,306
Citizen just got plugged.

825
00:35:37,307 --> 00:35:38,933
Who was it?

826
00:35:38,934 --> 00:35:40,893
Blacky Franchot.

827
00:35:40,894 --> 00:35:42,478
Dead?

828
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:43,438
Yeah.

829
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:47,066
Do any talking before he went out?

830
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:48,902
Not to me he didn't.

831
00:35:49,945 --> 00:35:51,445
Relax.

832
00:35:51,446 --> 00:35:52,947
Where do you want to go?

833
00:35:52,948 --> 00:35:55,866
I was going home to bed.

834
00:35:55,867 --> 00:35:58,036
Without medical attention.

835
00:35:59,204 --> 00:36:01,039
Give me the address.

836
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,083
No, thanks.

837
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:07,253
It's funny how you keep turning up.

838
00:36:07,254 --> 00:36:08,463
It's hilarious.

839
00:36:08,505 --> 00:36:11,549
How was it you were around back there?

840
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,842
He called me.

841
00:36:12,843 --> 00:36:14,135
How did he know about you?

842
00:36:14,136 --> 00:36:17,138
I haven't the faintest idea.

843
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:18,514
What did he want?

844
00:36:18,515 --> 00:36:21,684
He wanted to tell me about Rosita.

845
00:36:21,685 --> 00:36:23,060
And he didn't.

846
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:24,060
No.

847
00:36:25,314 --> 00:36:27,898
What did Rosita have to do with this?

848
00:36:27,899 --> 00:36:29,233
Nothing.

849
00:36:29,234 --> 00:36:30,526
Look, Solly, I don't care how many

850
00:36:30,527 --> 00:36:32,862
are killed or who does it.

851
00:36:32,863 --> 00:36:33,904
Naturally not.

852
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:36,073
You being a reporter.

853
00:36:36,074 --> 00:36:38,159
Was she Blacky's girl?

854
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,162
Blacky's, yours, mine.

855
00:36:42,414 --> 00:36:44,707
I know a guy who thinks
she was the greatest kid

856
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:46,000
that ever lived.

857
00:36:46,001 --> 00:36:48,085
Stone, okay.

858
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:50,463
I'm gonna find out, Solly.

859
00:36:50,464 --> 00:36:53,550
Nobody likes to hurt reporters, Ed.

860
00:36:54,468 --> 00:36:55,636
You know that.

861
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,012
I'm glad to hear you say that.

862
00:36:58,013 --> 00:36:59,305
Nobody likes to but sometimes

863
00:36:59,306 --> 00:37:02,516
a wise guy brings it on himself.

864
00:37:02,517 --> 00:37:07,396
Solly, why do you shake when
I mention the name Rosita?

865
00:37:07,397 --> 00:37:08,899
Why does everyone?

866
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,322
I'm not shaking.

867
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:18,324
You're hiding behind a gun.

868
00:37:18,325 --> 00:37:19,867
For the last time, Adams,

869
00:37:19,868 --> 00:37:20,702
drop it!

870
00:37:20,703 --> 00:37:22,621
Or I'll be the berry.

871
00:37:27,084 --> 00:37:28,752
Let him out, Bill.

872
00:37:44,267 --> 00:37:45,309
Sorry, baby.

873
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,769
I gave you up long ago.

874
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,603
Come here.

875
00:37:47,604 --> 00:37:48,438
No, no, I'm afraid to kiss you.

876
00:37:48,439 --> 00:37:50,940
I feel I'm taking up
too much of your time.

877
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:52,024
Where's your phone?

878
00:37:52,025 --> 00:37:56,195
You mean to say you
aren't through working yet?

879
00:37:56,196 --> 00:37:58,447
What you people need is a union.

880
00:37:58,448 --> 00:37:59,949
We've got one.

881
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:03,537
Well, who's the head
of it, Captain Blye?

882
00:38:04,454 --> 00:38:06,831
- Journal.
- Give me the desk.

883
00:38:06,832 --> 00:38:08,833
- Gribbe.
- Hello, George.

884
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:11,752
I know who killed Blacky
Franchot but I can't prove it.

885
00:38:11,753 --> 00:38:13,505
I can't risk telling you.

886
00:38:13,547 --> 00:38:16,966
Yeah, sure, but just give me an idea.

887
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:19,760
You'd find me in a
burdock patch out in Cicero

888
00:38:19,761 --> 00:38:21,679
12 hours after you catch this guy.

889
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,265
Uh, where did you get
to, Ed, who did you see?

890
00:38:24,266 --> 00:38:26,016
Nothing doing.

891
00:38:26,017 --> 00:38:26,977
Where are you?

892
00:38:26,978 --> 00:38:28,728
I'm at a place, uh,

893
00:38:28,729 --> 00:38:31,898
gotta shake down a personal witness.

894
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,649
Okay, but stay away from here.

895
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,151
Anstruder's heard about it and he wants

896
00:38:35,152 --> 00:38:36,527
to know how you got to Blacky.

897
00:38:36,528 --> 00:38:38,028
He's getting out a warrant for you.

898
00:38:38,029 --> 00:38:39,613
- Give me your phone number.
- Nothing doing.

899
00:38:39,614 --> 00:38:41,407
Ed, what's the matter with you?

900
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:44,160
- I'm tired.
- Well so am [!

901
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:47,247
Ed.

902
00:38:47,248 --> 00:38:48,414
Hm?

903
00:38:48,415 --> 00:38:51,459
Blacky Franchot was killed?

904
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,752
Yeah.

905
00:38:55,881 --> 00:38:56,715
Ed.

906
00:38:56,716 --> 00:38:59,258
Forget about Rosita and that little book.

907
00:38:59,259 --> 00:39:00,426
Please.

908
00:39:00,427 --> 00:39:01,426
54 names.

909
00:39:02,554 --> 00:39:04,681
Each one with a different picture of her.

910
00:39:04,723 --> 00:39:08,268
She was a dame, a saint,
a gangster's girl.

911
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,979
And a sister who remembered birthdays.

912
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,733
You're only going to get into trouble.

913
00:39:14,775 --> 00:39:16,276
Blacky Franchot.

914
00:39:17,235 --> 00:39:19,488
Fixed with Blacky Franchot.

915
00:39:21,406 --> 00:39:23,532
How did she fit in?

916
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:24,992
How does it happen that after she's dead

917
00:39:24,993 --> 00:39:28,829
the guy who's in love
with her gets knocked off?

918
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,915
Do you know, Leona?

919
00:39:30,916 --> 00:39:31,915
No.

920
00:39:33,752 --> 00:39:36,171
Do you think she loved him?

921
00:39:37,714 --> 00:39:39,633
Yes, I think she did.

922
00:39:41,718 --> 00:39:43,177
Goon.

923
00:39:43,178 --> 00:39:46,472
Oh, I'm only guessing, I don't know.

924
00:39:46,473 --> 00:39:47,556
Don't lie to me baby,

925
00:39:47,557 --> 00:39:51,060
you know I'm gonna get it out of you.

926
00:39:51,061 --> 00:39:51,895
All right.

927
00:39:51,896 --> 00:39:53,604
I knew her.

928
00:39:53,605 --> 00:39:57,608
We had an apartment together
when she met Blacky.

929
00:39:57,609 --> 00:40:00,486
He lived on the same floor.

930
00:40:03,073 --> 00:40:05,992
I'll beat your little brains out.

931
00:40:14,751 --> 00:40:15,960
Sorry.

932
00:40:15,961 --> 00:40:18,003
I'd rather you didn't bother.

933
00:40:18,004 --> 00:40:18,838
Get hurt?

934
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:19,673
No.

935
00:40:19,674 --> 00:40:22,132
I'd like it very much if
you'd just leave me alone.

936
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:24,510
I said I was sorry and
I'll explain it if you like.

937
00:40:24,511 --> 00:40:26,136
I'm Blacky Franchot and I didn't remember

938
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:27,930
the name Rosita Jean D'Ur either

939
00:40:27,931 --> 00:40:30,349
when I saw it on the
box, but it bothered me.

940
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,268
Then I remembered Rosita Ditmond,

941
00:40:32,269 --> 00:40:36,856
lived out on Franklin
Park, went to grade school.

942
00:40:36,857 --> 00:40:38,649
Blacky Franchot.

943
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:39,692
Edgar Franchot?

944
00:40:39,693 --> 00:40:41,694
The shy little kid, two
classes ahead of you.

945
00:40:41,695 --> 00:40:43,112
Mop of black hair.

946
00:40:43,113 --> 00:40:44,196
No.

947
00:40:44,197 --> 00:40:45,322
- You don't believe me?
- No.

948
00:40:45,323 --> 00:40:46,490
How would I know?

949
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:48,242
You could have found out some way.

950
00:40:48,243 --> 00:40:49,160
Okay.

951
00:40:49,161 --> 00:40:53,038
But is it all right now
if I say that I'm sorry?

952
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:54,124
I guess so.

953
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:57,209
I've been meaning to come in see you.

954
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,503
But your old shyness held you back.

955
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:00,796
I've been busy.

956
00:41:00,797 --> 00:41:02,214
But I've watched you come in and go out.

957
00:41:02,215 --> 00:41:03,799
I've seen the Joes you go out with.

958
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,093
A bunch of babysitters.

959
00:41:06,094 --> 00:41:08,220
What are you afraid of?

960
00:41:08,221 --> 00:41:09,055
Afraid?

961
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:12,058
Yeah, I've been worried about you.

962
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:15,519
Why the name Jean D'Ur?

963
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,645
I was married.

964
00:41:16,646 --> 00:41:18,272
Had a babysitter?

965
00:41:18,273 --> 00:41:19,107
Why?

966
00:41:19,108 --> 00:41:21,650
He'd never let a girl like you get away.

967
00:41:21,651 --> 00:41:23,694
He was killed.

968
00:41:23,695 --> 00:41:24,696
Oh, tough.

969
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:27,823
What are you doing now?

970
00:41:27,824 --> 00:41:29,450
I work in an art store.

971
00:41:29,451 --> 00:41:31,035
Want a better job?

972
00:41:31,036 --> 00:41:34,955
I don't want anything,
Edgar Blacky Franchot.

973
00:41:34,956 --> 00:41:36,290
A better job,

974
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:38,000
or somebody to worry about me?

975
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:42,963
Or to talk over the nostalgic
days of Franklin Park?

976
00:41:42,964 --> 00:41:43,881
Hi.

977
00:41:43,882 --> 00:41:44,715
Leona.

978
00:41:44,716 --> 00:41:45,550
This is Mr. Franchot.

979
00:41:45,551 --> 00:41:47,259
We met on the stairs.

980
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,094
Oh.

981
00:41:48,095 --> 00:41:49,803
He's an old schoolmate of mine,

982
00:41:49,804 --> 00:41:50,639
he says.

983
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,307
What have you been doing to find out?

984
00:41:53,308 --> 00:41:55,559
Thanks for the psychology lesson.

985
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,730
And, uh, I'll try to improve the jobs.

986
00:42:21,044 --> 00:42:22,336
No go?

987
00:42:22,337 --> 00:42:23,587
I wish you wouldn't.

988
00:42:23,588 --> 00:42:25,547
The delivery boys come at all hours.

989
00:42:25,548 --> 00:42:28,133
This is the first one you
brought back personally.

990
00:42:28,134 --> 00:42:30,552
Look, I'm all ready for you.

991
00:42:30,553 --> 00:42:31,553
You like spaghetti?

992
00:42:31,554 --> 00:42:32,721
I cooked it myself.

993
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:35,140
Well, I told Tony how to cook it.

994
00:42:35,141 --> 00:42:36,517
No, thanks.

995
00:42:36,518 --> 00:42:37,352
Okay.

996
00:42:37,353 --> 00:42:38,353
I'm sorry.

997
00:42:40,063 --> 00:42:44,817
What did you mean the other
day when you said I was afraid?

998
00:42:44,818 --> 00:42:48,363
If you'll have one
glass of wine with me.

999
00:42:50,657 --> 00:42:53,660
I can explain it best from my angle.

1000
00:42:56,287 --> 00:42:59,874
Four years ago I bought
a girl a mink coat.

1001
00:43:00,959 --> 00:43:03,712
I made payments on it for a year.

1002
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,881
I used to stand outside her
building nights just looking up

1003
00:43:07,882 --> 00:43:09,133
at her windows.

1004
00:43:09,134 --> 00:43:13,888
Trouble is I stood there
one of the wrong nights.

1005
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:17,308
Since then I've never been pushed around.

1006
00:43:19,894 --> 00:43:22,563
You've been going at it
differently with those babysitters

1007
00:43:22,564 --> 00:43:25,607
of yours, but it's the same idea.

1008
00:43:25,608 --> 00:43:29,529
Who is the guy gave you
the K.O., your husband?

1009
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,824
You couldn't be hurt ever again.

1010
00:43:33,825 --> 00:43:35,284
No, not even you.

1011
00:43:35,285 --> 00:43:36,702
You think that's good?

1012
00:43:36,703 --> 00:43:38,370
I know it is.

1013
00:43:38,371 --> 00:43:40,247
So you're not afraid.

1014
00:43:40,248 --> 00:43:41,623
If you were through with someone,

1015
00:43:41,624 --> 00:43:44,461
you'd throw them away like a burnt match.

1016
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:45,753
That's it.

1017
00:43:45,754 --> 00:43:50,424
I don't think I believe
anything you tell me.

1018
00:43:50,425 --> 00:43:51,676
Yes, you can.

1019
00:43:52,886 --> 00:43:55,262
What do you do, Blacky?

1020
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:57,222
I put things together.

1021
00:43:57,223 --> 00:44:00,100
Somebody has an idea and needs
some money I find the money.

1022
00:44:00,101 --> 00:44:02,436
Right now I'm putting together a show.

1023
00:44:02,437 --> 00:44:03,520
What kind of show?

1024
00:44:03,521 --> 00:44:06,065
Something they call "Happy Days".

1025
00:44:06,066 --> 00:44:07,524
Wanna be in it?

1026
00:44:07,525 --> 00:44:08,610
No, thanks.

1027
00:44:09,611 --> 00:44:13,030
Blacky, who was the
principal of our old school?

1028
00:44:13,031 --> 00:44:15,741
There you got me.

1029
00:44:15,742 --> 00:44:18,160
How did you find out about me?

1030
00:44:18,161 --> 00:44:19,578
A postcard got to my box.

1031
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:20,455
What difference does it make?

1032
00:44:20,456 --> 00:44:23,791
I could have gone to the same school.

1033
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:27,461
Except that you would have remembered me.

1034
00:44:27,462 --> 00:44:31,340
Maybe I wouldn't have stood
outside the wrong building.

1035
00:44:31,341 --> 00:44:34,344
If you hadn't married the wrong guy.

1036
00:44:38,723 --> 00:44:41,142
The spaghetti's getting cold.

1037
00:44:42,102 --> 00:44:44,686
If I don't stay, you'll say I'm afraid.

1038
00:44:44,687 --> 00:44:46,939
Wouldn't that be right?

1039
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:50,901
Blacky, I think I can prove
that you're not irresistible.

1040
00:44:50,902 --> 00:44:53,946
She was afraid of him
in the beginning, I think.

1041
00:44:53,947 --> 00:44:56,448
Funny how a man can frighten a girl

1042
00:44:56,449 --> 00:44:58,742
and attract her at the same time.

1043
00:44:58,743 --> 00:45:01,620
And he was an appealing guy.

1044
00:45:01,621 --> 00:45:02,913
And careful.

1045
00:45:02,914 --> 00:45:04,998
Never a false move.

1046
00:45:04,999 --> 00:45:06,291
At first I thought it was an act.

1047
00:45:06,292 --> 00:45:10,921
Like he was trying to move in
slowly so no one would notice.

1048
00:45:10,922 --> 00:45:13,716
But if you ever saw them together.

1049
00:45:13,758 --> 00:45:16,677
Like that night at the "Happy Days" party,

1050
00:45:16,678 --> 00:45:18,595
after the opening of the show.

1051
00:45:34,487 --> 00:45:35,946
Blacky.

1052
00:45:35,947 --> 00:45:37,489
Solly wants to see you.

1053
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:38,866
Okay, Spingler.

1054
00:45:38,867 --> 00:45:39,784
Be right back.

1055
00:45:39,785 --> 00:45:41,035
Don't get lost.

1056
00:45:57,177 --> 00:45:58,385
Where do you suppose
they get the energy?

1057
00:45:58,386 --> 00:46:00,637
They've been doing that now
for three straight hours.

1058
00:46:00,638 --> 00:46:02,723
They've been pointing
to this for months.

1059
00:46:02,724 --> 00:46:04,349
Are you in theatricals, too.

1060
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:06,519
No, I'm in an art store.

1061
00:46:07,437 --> 00:46:08,271
Oh.

1062
00:46:08,272 --> 00:46:09,938
Do you model?

1063
00:46:09,939 --> 00:46:10,773
No, no.

1064
00:46:10,774 --> 00:46:13,442
I sell the pictures they hang over sofas.

1065
00:46:13,443 --> 00:46:16,320
One large picture or several small ones?

1066
00:46:16,321 --> 00:46:18,530
Large pictures are definitely out.

1067
00:46:18,531 --> 00:46:20,157
Of course, six small ones will do.

1068
00:46:20,158 --> 00:46:21,491
For a long sofa?

1069
00:46:21,492 --> 00:46:22,618
Otherwise four.

1070
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:25,913
It's also smart to match the
color with the upholstery.

1071
00:46:25,914 --> 00:46:27,581
There's plenty of room to dance.

1072
00:46:27,582 --> 00:46:28,707
Would you care to?

1073
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:30,292
Yes, of course.

1074
00:46:33,087 --> 00:46:35,005
What do you do with a man like that?

1075
00:46:35,006 --> 00:46:38,217
Who has so much money he
files it away under M.

1076
00:46:38,218 --> 00:46:40,844
And who's idea of fun was
to find something he wanted

1077
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:44,014
and then start a campaign to get it.

1078
00:46:44,015 --> 00:46:45,724
Rosita didn't know either.

1079
00:46:45,725 --> 00:46:47,726
Other than to stay away from him

1080
00:46:47,727 --> 00:46:52,357
and put the flowers in water
and send the presents back.

1081
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:57,109
Blacky.

1082
00:46:58,279 --> 00:46:59,278
Blacky.

1083
00:47:01,616 --> 00:47:02,615
Blacky.

1084
00:47:05,454 --> 00:47:06,454
Put them out!

1085
00:47:06,496 --> 00:47:07,871
Put them out!

1086
00:47:07,872 --> 00:47:10,499
- Blacky!
- Go away, please.

1087
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,417
- Blacky.
- Go away, Rosita,

1088
00:47:12,418 --> 00:47:13,710
I don't want you to see me like this.

1089
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:16,338
- Blacky, darling!
- Go away, please!

1090
00:47:16,339 --> 00:47:18,423
- Can I call a doctor.
- No, no.

1091
00:47:18,424 --> 00:47:20,175
You don't understand.

1092
00:47:20,176 --> 00:47:21,261
Go, will you!

1093
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,772
Go away from me, Rosita.

1094
00:47:33,773 --> 00:47:35,274
I'm licked.

1095
00:47:35,275 --> 00:47:36,358
I gotta get away.

1096
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:38,193
I can't fight them.

1097
00:47:38,194 --> 00:47:39,569
I'm a buster, Rosita.

1098
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:40,862
I'm licked.

1099
00:47:40,863 --> 00:47:43,283
We'll both go away, Blacky.

1100
00:47:46,577 --> 00:47:48,328
She took him away to
some place in the country.

1101
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:49,663
But Blacky couldn't stand it.

1102
00:47:49,664 --> 00:47:51,665
His nerves were shot.

1103
00:47:51,666 --> 00:47:54,376
He told her he was leaving for her sake.

1104
00:47:54,377 --> 00:47:55,376
And he ran.

1105
00:47:56,921 --> 00:47:59,798
I was on the road with a
show when she came back.

1106
00:47:59,799 --> 00:48:01,758
You saw her again, baby?

1107
00:48:01,759 --> 00:48:04,262
She wrote a couple of times.

1108
00:48:05,096 --> 00:48:06,930
It was a funny letter.

1109
00:48:06,931 --> 00:48:08,265
What do you mean?

1110
00:48:08,266 --> 00:48:11,518
Well, she didn't say
anything at all, really.

1111
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,063
But if you read them over a second time,

1112
00:48:15,064 --> 00:48:16,899
she sounded so lonely.

1113
00:48:18,776 --> 00:48:22,571
All in all, 
 heard she was doing fine.

1114
00:48:22,572 --> 00:48:24,157
With G.G. Temple.

1115
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:27,160
How strange.

1116
00:48:29,329 --> 00:48:32,332
Give me some coffee, will you, baby?

1117
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:34,876
All right.

1118
00:49:14,374 --> 00:49:15,457
Hiya, Tommy.

1119
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:17,794
- How's Rosita, Ed?
- Hi, Ed.

1120
00:49:17,835 --> 00:49:18,835
Well, Ed, what's new?

1121
00:49:18,836 --> 00:49:20,337
He's just gonna read a breakout.

1122
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:23,256
The narrative of the old
economy security market,

1123
00:49:23,257 --> 00:49:26,760
nothing which, of course,
is very important to us.

1124
00:49:26,761 --> 00:49:29,055
- It says here...
- What have you got?

1125
00:49:29,097 --> 00:49:31,223
Wires from New York.

1126
00:49:31,224 --> 00:49:33,725
"Cavanaugh and Bat
must be Jerry Cavanaugh

1127
00:49:33,726 --> 00:49:35,560
and his fighter Bat Bennett.

1128
00:49:35,561 --> 00:49:39,147
They're en route to your city
for fight tonight at stadium.

1129
00:49:39,148 --> 00:49:42,902
Last mailing address
care of Hotspur Shaner."

1130
00:49:44,028 --> 00:49:46,071
Give me a couple of
duckets for that fight.

1131
00:49:46,072 --> 00:49:47,739
These characters are hot.

1132
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:48,574
Why?

1133
00:49:48,575 --> 00:49:51,284
Written in the book with
pencil and it's still fresh.

1134
00:49:51,285 --> 00:49:53,537
That means they're the latest entry.

1135
00:49:53,538 --> 00:49:54,913
What else have you got?

1136
00:49:54,914 --> 00:49:57,332
None of these ever heard of her.

1137
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:58,458
What about Belle Dorset?

1138
00:49:58,459 --> 00:50:01,086
Oh, nothing yet, but
I got a picture of her.

1139
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,962
Look.

1140
00:50:01,963 --> 00:50:02,797
It's Ronnie Bland.

1141
00:50:02,798 --> 00:50:05,882
And look who's peeking
out from behind her.

1142
00:50:05,883 --> 00:50:06,716
Solly Wellman.

1143
00:50:06,717 --> 00:50:07,552
Yeah.

1144
00:50:07,553 --> 00:50:09,636
Hey, let's pick me another dame, shall we?

1145
00:50:09,637 --> 00:50:10,471
You stick with Belle Dorset.

1146
00:50:10,472 --> 00:50:12,806
Yeah, but I'd like one that I can find.

1147
00:50:12,807 --> 00:50:14,558
Also I want you to
check on John Spingler,

1148
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,560
the man with a heart of gold.

1149
00:50:16,561 --> 00:50:19,646
He never heard of Rosita, but
he's offering to bury her.

1150
00:50:19,647 --> 00:50:20,481
Yeah, and somebody else did, too.

1151
00:50:20,482 --> 00:50:23,066
Haymes at the morgue got a
money order for 500 bucks.

1152
00:50:26,362 --> 00:50:28,530
Hey, take pictures for me, will you?

1153
00:50:28,531 --> 00:50:30,157
Tomorrow morning.

1154
00:50:30,158 --> 00:50:33,368
I want a simple place and a quiet funeral.

1155
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:35,579
No circusing around.

1156
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,581
Pig's been taking care of that.

1157
00:50:37,582 --> 00:50:40,000
Anything you say.

1158
00:50:40,001 --> 00:50:42,210
You can always get Bat
to make up a fortune.

1159
00:50:42,211 --> 00:50:43,045
Yes, we'll do that.

1160
00:50:43,046 --> 00:50:45,130
- Mr. Temple!
- See you Sunday.

1161
00:50:45,131 --> 00:50:46,506
Right.

1162
00:50:46,507 --> 00:50:48,550
Thanks for the 500.

1163
00:50:48,551 --> 00:50:50,719
I don't know what you're talking about.

1164
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,556
You read where Blacky
Franchot was killed, didn't you?

1165
00:50:54,557 --> 00:50:56,433
By an odd coincidence
I happened to be there

1166
00:50:56,434 --> 00:50:57,976
when he went out.

1167
00:50:57,977 --> 00:51:00,395
You knew Franchot, didn't you, Mr. Temple?

1168
00:51:00,396 --> 00:51:03,523
Belle Dorset, Solly Wellman.

1169
00:51:03,524 --> 00:51:05,984
At least they were at the party you gave

1170
00:51:05,985 --> 00:51:07,903
to the Happy Days Company.

1171
00:51:07,904 --> 00:51:09,613
You met Rosita there.

1172
00:51:09,614 --> 00:51:12,115
I didn't give that
party, I was just a guest.

1173
00:51:12,116 --> 00:51:14,618
And I don't know any of the
people you're talking about.

1174
00:51:14,619 --> 00:51:18,663
But I did meet Rosita there
and I told that to the police.

1175
00:51:18,664 --> 00:51:20,165
I also told them that I'd found her

1176
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:24,169
a cheap grasping little thing
who tried to blackmail me.

1177
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:26,505
You're a liar, Temple.

1178
00:51:26,506 --> 00:51:29,132
You found her to be a
girl you were crazy about.

1179
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:31,635
But she wouldn't have
anything to do with you.

1180
00:51:31,636 --> 00:51:33,845
Till Franchot was run off.

1181
00:51:33,846 --> 00:51:37,224
Now who would you get
to do a chore like that?

1182
00:51:37,225 --> 00:51:38,392
Solly Wellman?

1183
00:51:39,393 --> 00:51:43,021
You know what you are,
Temple, and so do I.

1184
00:52:12,426 --> 00:52:15,011
We've saved it for a month now.

1185
00:52:15,012 --> 00:52:16,681
Too long altogether.

1186
00:52:17,598 --> 00:52:19,599
But in the spring she comes in.

1187
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,018
A very sweet little girl.

1188
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:24,271
I couldn't sell it on her.

1189
00:52:24,272 --> 00:52:25,730
When was the last time she came?

1190
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:28,275
Oh, five weeks, maybe four.

1191
00:52:28,276 --> 00:52:29,484
How did she look?

1192
00:52:29,485 --> 00:52:30,819
Did she look good?

1193
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:34,239
She was thin, too pale, maybe.

1194
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,116
She wanted to see it.

1195
00:52:36,117 --> 00:52:39,119
She wanted to be sure we hadn't sold it.

1196
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,454
You can sell it to me
now, Mrs. Schleffler.

1197
00:52:41,455 --> 00:52:43,541
No, this I couldn't do.

1198
00:52:45,334 --> 00:52:48,128
You don't believe she's dead, do you?

1199
00:52:48,129 --> 00:52:49,629
I read it in the paper.

1200
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:52,842
But you see, I got to have the receipt.

1201
00:52:54,635 --> 00:52:56,511
She kept coming in to
see it, but she never

1202
00:52:56,512 --> 00:52:57,762
had the $12.

1203
00:52:57,763 --> 00:53:01,016
- She was poor, maybe.
- But no, she was not.

1204
00:53:01,017 --> 00:53:03,768
- Maybe she is busy.
- Or maybe she never thought

1205
00:53:03,769 --> 00:53:06,062
of it until things got tough.

1206
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:08,565
When she had to have
something to cling to.

1207
00:53:08,566 --> 00:53:10,985
So you liked her very much.

1208
00:53:12,361 --> 00:53:13,863
I never met her.

1209
00:53:14,822 --> 00:53:16,157
Hello, wizard.

1210
00:53:17,033 --> 00:53:19,702
What's gonna happen around here?

1211
00:53:22,496 --> 00:53:24,956
Why should anything happen around here?

1212
00:53:24,957 --> 00:53:27,542
40 minutes after Blacky
Franchot left your dame

1213
00:53:27,543 --> 00:53:30,211
in the morgue, he's dead.

1214
00:53:30,212 --> 00:53:31,379
What did the dame have to do with it?

1215
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,547
Now look, Jack, if I knew I-

1216
00:53:32,548 --> 00:53:35,258
You knew enough to be at
Blacky's before he went out.

1217
00:53:35,259 --> 00:53:38,887
There's only one way that
you can cut the lead on us,

1218
00:53:38,888 --> 00:53:39,972
only one way.

1219
00:53:40,973 --> 00:53:43,433
You were in her room at
the hotel ahead of us.

1220
00:53:43,434 --> 00:53:45,393
Oh, Jack, you don't think
I would hold out on you,

1221
00:53:45,394 --> 00:53:46,228
would you?

1222
00:53:46,229 --> 00:53:47,354
Heh.

1223
00:53:47,355 --> 00:53:50,523
You found a diary or
an address book there.

1224
00:53:50,524 --> 00:53:51,983
I told you I have visions.

1225
00:53:51,984 --> 00:53:53,653
You wanna search me?

1226
00:53:55,571 --> 00:53:57,989
By the way, have you got a warrant for me?

1227
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:59,616
Could have.

1228
00:53:59,617 --> 00:54:01,409
What's he doing here?

1229
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:02,869
Looking at fans.

1230
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:03,953
Fans?

1231
00:54:03,954 --> 00:54:06,247
Yeah, Rosita's fan.

1232
00:54:06,248 --> 00:54:07,208
All right!

1233
00:54:07,209 --> 00:54:08,541
Now look, Jack,

1234
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:10,168
We're going at this all wrong.

1235
00:54:10,169 --> 00:54:13,380
I'm after the story of a girl
and you're after a Killer.

1236
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:15,924
I'll do everything I can to
help you, but don't box me in.

1237
00:54:15,925 --> 00:54:18,134
If the guys who killed Blacky Franchot

1238
00:54:18,135 --> 00:54:19,803
find me trading with you,

1239
00:54:19,804 --> 00:54:22,389
you'll have
another corpse on your hands.

1240
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:25,433
Somebody's gonna shoot
you sooner or later.

1241
00:54:25,434 --> 00:54:27,268
- Come on.
- Where to?

1242
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:30,438
Wherever you'd go if we weren't along.

1243
00:54:30,439 --> 00:54:31,940
I haven't any idea.

1244
00:54:31,941 --> 00:54:34,234
Then we'll just ride around.

1245
00:54:34,235 --> 00:54:35,736
That'll be nice.

1246
00:54:36,987 --> 00:54:41,158
I'd like to leave a $2
deposit on the fan, please.

1247
00:54:47,832 --> 00:54:50,751
Three, four, five and five is 10.

1248
00:54:53,295 --> 00:54:54,171
Thank you, very much.

1249
00:54:54,172 --> 00:54:55,673
It's a pleasure.

1250
00:55:00,928 --> 00:55:01,970
Where to?

1251
00:55:01,971 --> 00:55:04,973
As I remember, 3675, Belmont Avenue.

1252
00:55:04,974 --> 00:55:07,475
A gent named Hotspur Shaner.

1253
00:55:07,476 --> 00:55:10,103
There may be a resemblance,
but I can't be sure,

1254
00:55:10,104 --> 00:55:12,439
my eyes are not good.

1255
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,567
What did the other girl
who lived here call herself?

1256
00:55:15,568 --> 00:55:18,278
I don't know what I
have to do with this case.

1257
00:55:18,279 --> 00:55:20,030
I've read about this Rosita of yours,

1258
00:55:20,072 --> 00:55:22,365
but any attempt to connect
me with such a person

1259
00:55:22,366 --> 00:55:24,075
is nothing short of ridiculous.

1260
00:55:24,076 --> 00:55:26,661
As a matter of fact we
didn't say you were connected.

1261
00:55:26,662 --> 00:55:29,914
Mr. Adams knows more about it than we do.

1262
00:55:29,915 --> 00:55:32,917
Would you mind telling
us her name, Mr. Shaner?

1263
00:55:32,918 --> 00:55:33,960
Ellen Ransom.

1264
00:55:33,961 --> 00:55:36,796
And you you'll find you can't
drag her through your paper.

1265
00:55:36,797 --> 00:55:40,383
She was one of the finest
young women I've ever known.

1266
00:55:40,384 --> 00:55:42,761
And she acted as your housekeeper.

1267
00:55:42,762 --> 00:55:44,345
How long was she here?

1268
00:55:44,346 --> 00:55:46,431
- Not for a month.
- When?

1269
00:55:46,432 --> 00:55:48,559
She came just after Christmas.

1270
00:55:48,601 --> 00:55:50,310
How did you meet her if
you say you can't get out

1271
00:55:50,311 --> 00:55:51,479
of this house?

1272
00:55:52,605 --> 00:55:54,898
I see no reason why I
should answer any more

1273
00:55:54,899 --> 00:55:56,107
of your questions.

1274
00:55:56,108 --> 00:55:57,942
Perhaps you'd better, Mr. Shaner.

1275
00:55:57,943 --> 00:56:00,612
You said that the girl
resembled the picture.

1276
00:56:00,613 --> 00:56:02,864
How did you meet her?

1277
00:56:02,865 --> 00:56:04,908
My nephew brought her here.

1278
00:56:04,909 --> 00:56:08,745
Would you mind telling
us your nephew's name?

1279
00:56:08,746 --> 00:56:10,705
John Shaner.

1280
00:56:10,706 --> 00:56:12,291
Or John Spingler.

1281
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:15,710
It's quite a family resemblance.

1282
00:56:15,711 --> 00:56:18,630
John Spingler runs a bar
down in the North side.

1283
00:56:18,631 --> 00:56:20,548
I saw him yesterday offer to bury her.

1284
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:22,759
He was down at the morgue to see her.

1285
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,843
It's not the same girl.

1286
00:56:23,844 --> 00:56:25,887
It can't be, I can't believe it.

1287
00:56:25,888 --> 00:56:26,722
Why not?

1288
00:56:26,723 --> 00:56:27,931
You knew the real Rosita.

1289
00:56:27,932 --> 00:56:30,141
The one the papers are
writing about is a phony.

1290
00:56:30,142 --> 00:56:31,559
But you are the newspapers.

1291
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,270
She's what you've made of her.

1292
00:56:34,271 --> 00:56:35,523
Public image.

1293
00:56:36,732 --> 00:56:37,900
It's not mine.

1294
00:56:39,318 --> 00:56:41,653
I think I know her better than you do.

1295
00:56:41,654 --> 00:56:45,574
That's why I want to
write the truth about her.

1296
00:56:47,535 --> 00:56:49,869
What caused her to leave you, Mr. Shaner?

1297
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:51,538
I've never known.

1298
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:54,708
I'll get it.

1299
00:56:57,378 --> 00:56:58,712
Oh, hello, Pete.

1300
00:57:01,006 --> 00:57:02,715
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, Pete.

1301
00:57:02,716 --> 00:57:03,716
How did he get here?

1302
00:57:03,717 --> 00:57:05,677
He got another vision.

1303
00:57:05,678 --> 00:57:06,928
Sure did.

1304
00:57:06,929 --> 00:57:08,930
We oughta be able to use him.

1305
00:57:08,931 --> 00:57:10,473
Is this Hotspur Shaner?

1306
00:57:10,474 --> 00:57:11,307
Yeah.

1307
00:57:11,308 --> 00:57:12,142
What's going on?

1308
00:57:12,143 --> 00:57:13,476
What's John Spingler to you?

1309
00:57:13,477 --> 00:57:15,103
May I ask who you are?

1310
00:57:15,104 --> 00:57:16,062
Peterson, homicide.

1311
00:57:16,063 --> 00:57:16,897
I don't understand.

1312
00:57:16,898 --> 00:57:19,066
We found your name on
a paper in his pocket.

1313
00:57:19,108 --> 00:57:19,900
In his pocket?

1314
00:57:19,901 --> 00:57:22,610
They picked him up in a
ditch a couple of hours ago.

1315
00:57:22,611 --> 00:57:23,445
Is he dead?

1316
00:57:23,446 --> 00:57:25,154
He certainly looked like he was when I-

1317
00:57:25,155 --> 00:57:26,073
Ed!

1318
00:57:26,115 --> 00:57:27,532
Ed!

1319
00:57:27,533 --> 00:57:29,368
Ed, you're a lunkhead!

1320
00:57:39,879 --> 00:57:41,254
Could you explain the killing?

1321
00:57:41,255 --> 00:57:43,172
The Evening Mirror bureau,

1322
00:57:43,173 --> 00:57:44,382
from the blotter, just came in.

1323
00:57:44,383 --> 00:57:46,093
Well, add this to it
with my compliments.

1324
00:57:46,135 --> 00:57:48,761
Spingler was another
one of Rosita's friends.

1325
00:57:48,762 --> 00:57:49,597
Rosita?

1326
00:57:49,598 --> 00:57:51,973
- You sure, Ed?
- Looks like a chain reaction.

1327
00:57:51,974 --> 00:57:52,808
Jimmy!

1328
00:57:52,809 --> 00:57:54,017
A chain reaction?

1329
00:57:54,018 --> 00:57:55,101
That's good, Ed.

1330
00:57:55,102 --> 00:57:55,936
What a gal.

1331
00:57:55,937 --> 00:57:58,313
You better come in and give
us a copy of that book.

1332
00:57:58,314 --> 00:57:59,148
Oh, no I don't.

1333
00:57:59,149 --> 00:58:00,315
I'll put a couple of men on it.

1334
00:58:00,316 --> 00:58:01,733
- No, no.
- Where are you?

1335
00:58:01,734 --> 00:58:03,985
Sorry, but I have to get out of here.

1336
00:58:03,986 --> 00:58:05,571
Hang on.

1337
00:58:15,122 --> 00:58:18,791
I was fondest of her than
anybody I ever worked for.

1338
00:58:18,792 --> 00:58:20,376
And now she's dead.

1339
00:58:20,377 --> 00:58:22,837
You haven't told me
why you left her, Hazel.

1340
00:58:22,838 --> 00:58:24,213
It wasn't exactly I left.

1341
00:58:24,214 --> 00:58:27,675
She left me on account of that man.

1342
00:58:27,676 --> 00:58:28,761
Mr. Temple?

1343
00:58:29,595 --> 00:58:30,595
You quarreled?

1344
00:58:30,596 --> 00:58:31,430
She and him.

1345
00:58:31,431 --> 00:58:35,558
I knew there was something
wrong the minute they came in.

1346
00:58:38,771 --> 00:58:40,897
Why, Miss Rosita!

1347
00:58:43,108 --> 00:58:44,984
What is it, honey?

1348
00:58:44,985 --> 00:58:45,819
Get out!

1349
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:46,903
But, Mr. Temple-

1350
00:58:46,904 --> 00:58:49,490
- Get out!
- Please, go, Hazel.

1351
00:58:51,075 --> 00:58:54,160
Now, tell me
again what you think of me.

1352
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:56,621
I can't talk to you.

1353
00:59:00,292 --> 00:59:02,961
I told you, I won't talk
to you about it now.

1354
00:59:02,962 --> 00:59:04,337
What will you do about it?

1355
00:59:04,338 --> 00:59:05,255
Where did you go.

1356
00:59:05,256 --> 00:59:06,464
Back to Bradshaw's, huh?

1357
00:59:06,465 --> 00:59:07,674
Please, don't!

1358
00:59:12,805 --> 00:59:14,222
I thought I told you to get out.

1359
00:59:14,223 --> 00:59:15,932
But Miss Rosita.

1360
00:59:15,933 --> 00:59:17,225
She has locked herself in the room.

1361
00:59:17,226 --> 00:59:19,227
You won't be needed any more.

1362
00:59:19,228 --> 00:59:20,979
You can go for the night.

1363
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:21,814
Yes, sir.

1364
00:59:21,815 --> 00:59:23,856
She was gone when I came
back in the morning.

1365
00:59:23,857 --> 00:59:26,901
She left me my money then
she mailed me my references.

1366
00:59:26,902 --> 00:59:27,736
When was that?

1367
00:59:27,737 --> 00:59:29,112
About a year ago.

1368
00:59:29,113 --> 00:59:31,364
Did you see her again?

1369
00:59:31,365 --> 00:59:33,992
After the scream you heard a noise.

1370
00:59:33,993 --> 00:59:35,618
- A thud.
- Yes, sir.

1371
00:59:35,619 --> 00:59:38,204
Was it like a body
falling down to the floor?

1372
00:59:38,205 --> 00:59:39,039
I don't know.

1373
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,039
It could be.

1374
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,499
I was so flustered.

1375
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,835
Do you suppose he hurt her?

1376
00:59:43,836 --> 00:59:45,087
I don't know.

1377
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,717
They're bad stories
they're writing about her.

1378
00:59:50,718 --> 00:59:51,885
Yes, I know.

1379
00:59:52,928 --> 00:59:53,927
Thank you.

1380
01:00:18,328 --> 01:00:21,330
He missed it a mile.

1381
01:00:21,331 --> 01:00:23,500
Come here, look at this!

1382
01:00:25,711 --> 01:00:27,295
Oh, oh, my.

1383
01:00:28,797 --> 01:00:31,550
Gee, who worked you over, mister?

1384
01:00:34,845 --> 01:00:36,764
Hey, do you need a job?

1385
01:00:41,351 --> 01:00:42,935
How's your head?

1386
01:00:42,936 --> 01:00:44,437
Looks bigger than Gribbe's.

1387
01:00:44,438 --> 01:00:46,439
By the way, Gribbe
sent a man over to Hazel.

1388
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,273
She's okay.

1389
01:00:47,274 --> 01:00:48,149
They didn't get to her.

1390
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:48,984
That's good.

1391
01:00:48,985 --> 01:00:50,068
Tommy Ditmond's outside.

1392
01:00:50,069 --> 01:00:50,985
You want to see him?

1393
01:00:50,986 --> 01:00:51,819
Yeah, send him in.

1394
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:52,654
Yeah.

1395
01:00:52,655 --> 01:00:53,863
Oh, and incidentally,
Anstruder's got a couple

1396
01:00:53,864 --> 01:00:56,283
of clods out looking for you.

1397
01:01:01,872 --> 01:01:02,706
Hello, Tommy.

1398
01:01:02,707 --> 01:01:04,665
Nothing I told you meant
anything to you, did it?

1399
01:01:04,666 --> 01:01:06,125
Look what you've been writing about her.

1400
01:01:06,126 --> 01:01:06,960
Dirty filth!

1401
01:01:06,961 --> 01:01:08,377
What kind of a guy are you anyway?

1402
01:01:08,378 --> 01:01:09,670
Why do you have to do this to her?

1403
01:01:09,671 --> 01:01:10,797
I didn't write that story, Tommy.

1404
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:11,631
Don't welsh.

1405
01:01:11,632 --> 01:01:12,466
Don't be yellow, too.

1406
01:01:12,467 --> 01:01:14,050
I've been digging up the
facts and running them in.

1407
01:01:14,051 --> 01:01:15,176
If it's been distorted, blame the desk.

1408
01:01:15,177 --> 01:01:16,177
You're making her look
like the lowest kind-

1409
01:01:16,178 --> 01:01:17,136
Tommy, will you wait.

1410
01:01:17,137 --> 01:01:17,971
You said you were sorry for her.

1411
01:01:17,972 --> 01:01:19,472
I am sorry, truly sorry.

1412
01:01:19,473 --> 01:01:20,307
You promised.

1413
01:01:20,308 --> 01:01:21,557
I know, but she wasn't news then.

1414
01:01:21,558 --> 01:01:23,976
Who made her news?

1415
01:01:23,977 --> 01:01:28,022
All right, cut me down if
it'll make you feel any better.

1416
01:01:28,023 --> 01:01:29,982
Maybe I was kidding you at first.

1417
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,818
But I'm not now.

1418
01:01:31,819 --> 01:01:33,653
Maybe I'm a heel and a rat.

1419
01:01:33,654 --> 01:01:35,154
But I didn't start out to be.

1420
01:01:35,155 --> 01:01:37,115
I was only following a story from a slant

1421
01:01:37,116 --> 01:01:39,033
that anybody else would've.

1422
01:01:39,034 --> 01:01:40,786
Now I'm caught in it.

1423
01:01:42,496 --> 01:01:46,415
You haven't any idea how
tight I'm caught in it.

1424
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:48,835
Tommy, I'm doing everything
I can to help her.

1425
01:01:49,711 --> 01:01:50,503
Ed!

1426
01:01:50,504 --> 01:01:51,503
Oh, sorry.

1427
01:01:54,299 --> 01:01:57,886
You didn't get hurt
seriously, did you, Ed?

1428
01:01:59,471 --> 01:02:01,639
Not by the mugs, no.

1429
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,349
Who's been writing this stuff?

1430
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,392
I have, myself.

1431
01:02:04,393 --> 01:02:06,227
What have you been using, a paintbrush?

1432
01:02:06,228 --> 01:02:07,728
This isn't Rosita.

1433
01:02:07,729 --> 01:02:08,521
What is?

1434
01:02:08,522 --> 01:02:09,398
That rather brings us to the point.

1435
01:02:09,399 --> 01:02:11,858
I'm sorry for not running
the paper to please you, Adams,

1436
01:02:11,859 --> 01:02:13,442
but if we knew more about the girl,

1437
01:02:13,443 --> 01:02:15,236
we might probably do different.

1438
01:02:15,237 --> 01:02:16,279
Now, George.

1439
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,321
Ed, I hate to say this,

1440
01:02:17,322 --> 01:02:20,449
but George seems to feel
that you're holding out.

1441
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:21,617
I have to do it my way.

1442
01:02:21,618 --> 01:02:22,785
What about Temple?

1443
01:02:22,786 --> 01:02:24,787
What about her relationship with Franchot-

1444
01:02:24,788 --> 01:02:26,414
I'm sorry, I have to do it my way.

1445
01:02:26,415 --> 01:02:28,166
If you have anything you're concealing,

1446
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:30,543
any leads that we ought to know-

1447
01:02:30,544 --> 01:02:31,670
I have 100.

1448
01:02:32,713 --> 01:02:34,922
I know too much, yet not enough.

1449
01:02:34,923 --> 01:02:39,093
When I get it all together,
I'll give it to you, my way.

1450
01:02:39,094 --> 01:02:39,928
I don't know what you want.

1451
01:02:39,929 --> 01:02:44,056
You've got two murders and
a sensational mystery woman.

1452
01:02:44,057 --> 01:02:44,892
If that isn't good enough,

1453
01:02:44,893 --> 01:02:46,434
you'd better get yourself
another reporter.

1454
01:02:46,435 --> 01:02:47,894
- Ed!
- I'm sick,

1455
01:02:47,895 --> 01:02:49,729
I'm filled up to my feet with it.

1456
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:51,063
Hey, where are you going?

1457
01:02:51,064 --> 01:02:53,274
I'm going to the bar then to the fight.

1458
01:02:53,275 --> 01:02:56,068
Oh, Gribbe, if you wanna
keep your hands in fiction,

1459
01:02:56,069 --> 01:02:58,196
why don't you write about the little girl

1460
01:02:58,197 --> 01:03:03,202
who was beat up by the
vice-president of the Ayckroyd Trust?

1461
01:03:03,952 --> 01:03:04,994
Yeah.

1462
01:03:04,995 --> 01:03:06,579
Thanks a lot.

1463
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:08,664
Seems our dear little Belle
Dorset once had a mother

1464
01:03:08,665 --> 01:03:11,334
that lived at 3640 West Randolph Street.

1465
01:03:11,335 --> 01:03:12,418
Any good?

1466
01:03:12,419 --> 01:03:14,670
"Rositas icy fingers reached
out from the morgue today

1467
01:03:14,671 --> 01:03:16,839
to bring death to..."

1468
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,174
He's a gruesome fellow, isn't he?

1469
01:03:18,175 --> 01:03:19,508
What's your assignment for tonight?

1470
01:03:19,509 --> 01:03:20,343
Keep you out of trouble.

1471
01:03:20,344 --> 01:03:21,178
- You know how?
- No.

1472
01:03:21,179 --> 01:03:22,595
Find Solly Wellman and stick to him.

1473
01:03:22,596 --> 01:03:23,679
Don't let him out of your sight.

1474
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,849
That way you'll keep me in good
health and keep Temple home.

1475
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:27,809
Temple?

1476
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:29,268
Why are you giving this to me, Ed?

1477
01:03:29,269 --> 01:03:30,103
What's wrong?

1478
01:03:30,104 --> 01:03:31,437
Just write it from a news angle.

1479
01:03:31,438 --> 01:03:32,272
I won't.

1480
01:03:32,273 --> 01:03:34,482
I'm interested in another
side of the story.

1481
01:03:34,483 --> 01:03:35,399
Oh, the dame, huh?

1482
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,235
But why, Ed?

1483
01:03:36,236 --> 01:03:38,819
Maybe because she isn't here to tell me.

1484
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:40,112
You know how it is, Pig.

1485
01:03:40,113 --> 01:03:42,823
You meet a girl, she starts
to tell you all about herself.

1486
01:03:42,824 --> 01:03:43,991
Oh, I don't know.

1487
01:03:43,992 --> 01:03:46,828
About her family, what happened
to her when she was a kid.

1488
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:48,788
About some guy she was in love with.

1489
01:03:48,789 --> 01:03:50,581
Rosita's guy stole the book.

1490
01:03:50,582 --> 01:03:52,708
How she was kicked around.

1491
01:03:52,709 --> 01:03:54,543
If you care anything at all about her,

1492
01:03:54,544 --> 01:03:56,545
you start to see it all through her eyes.

1493
01:03:56,546 --> 01:03:58,047
We got a lot of seeing to do, brother.

1494
01:03:58,048 --> 01:04:00,049
She was as loose as ashes.

1495
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:00,884
That's not true.

1496
01:04:00,885 --> 01:04:03,469
You see, Pig, you're tabbing
on circumstantial evidence.

1497
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:05,012
Okay, okay.

1498
01:04:05,013 --> 01:04:06,931
There's the story.

1499
01:04:06,932 --> 01:04:09,308
Not Gribbe's icy fingers from the morgue,

1500
01:04:09,309 --> 01:04:11,310
but the story of a girl
who was kicked around

1501
01:04:11,311 --> 01:04:12,561
because she had an overdose of sympathy,

1502
01:04:12,562 --> 01:04:14,313
loyalty or kindness.

1503
01:04:14,314 --> 01:04:15,274
Or something.

1504
01:04:15,275 --> 01:04:16,274
You know, possibly it's because

1505
01:04:16,275 --> 01:04:18,651
I haven't been drinking enough.

1506
01:04:18,652 --> 01:04:21,279
Do you mind if I know where we're going?

1507
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,407
To the fight, see Bat versus somebody.

1508
01:04:24,408 --> 01:04:26,784
You mean you're going to watch a fight?

1509
01:04:26,785 --> 01:04:27,619
Yeah, come on.

1510
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,204
See you later, Pig.

1511
01:04:32,457 --> 01:04:34,375
Ed, haven't you had enough?

1512
01:04:34,376 --> 01:04:37,586
Why do we have to go to fights?

1513
01:04:37,587 --> 01:04:39,213
I told you.

1514
01:04:39,214 --> 01:04:43,634
To see Bat Bennett and
his manager Cavanaugh,

1515
01:04:43,635 --> 01:04:47,764
If my hunch is right,
they'll be the last link.

1516
01:04:47,806 --> 01:04:48,598
They should be.

1517
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:51,518
They're the last entry in the book.

1518
01:04:52,436 --> 01:04:55,355
So, if we're lucky we'll wind it up.

1519
01:04:58,442 --> 01:05:03,363
Honey, what did you take as
a sedative before you met me?

1520
01:05:05,782 --> 01:05:08,035
Are you all right?

1521
01:05:08,076 --> 01:05:09,075
Sure.

1522
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:15,499
Did it ever occur to
you to get an honest job?

1523
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,336
I see what you mean.

1524
01:05:49,326 --> 01:05:50,118
Take your seat.

1525
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,536
I'll be down later.

1526
01:05:52,537 --> 01:05:54,122
This way, please.

1527
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,834
Just the kind of a
rotten trick a guy like you-

1528
01:05:58,835 --> 01:06:01,754
Look, Bat, I was
only taking care of your end.

1529
01:06:01,755 --> 01:06:02,588
Bat Bennett?

1530
01:06:02,589 --> 01:06:03,507
That's right.

1531
01:06:03,508 --> 01:06:04,757
Stay out of there, mister.

1532
01:06:04,758 --> 01:06:06,300
I tell you, keep away
from me or I'll kill you!

1533
01:06:06,301 --> 01:06:08,469
Let me talk to you, Bat, come on,

1534
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:09,345
You dirty fink.

1535
01:06:09,346 --> 01:06:10,180
Lay off, Jerry!

1536
01:06:10,181 --> 01:06:13,182
Bat, these guys are
like this all the time.

1537
01:06:13,183 --> 01:06:14,433
Only one fight away from championship

1538
01:06:14,434 --> 01:06:16,852
and I thought I knew fighters.

1539
01:06:16,853 --> 01:06:17,853
What's the matter, Jerry?

1540
01:06:17,854 --> 01:06:19,021
You read the paper?

1541
01:06:19,022 --> 01:06:20,272
I told every blockhead in the place

1542
01:06:20,273 --> 01:06:23,776
if he got hold of a paper
before this fight...

1543
01:06:23,777 --> 01:06:24,611
Who are you?

1544
01:06:24,612 --> 01:06:26,028
Adams, from The Journal.

1545
01:06:26,029 --> 01:06:27,029
Get out of here.

1546
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:28,781
I'd sit down if I were you, Jerry.

1547
01:06:28,782 --> 01:06:29,616
What's the idea?

1548
01:06:29,658 --> 01:06:31,117
I don't talk to any reporters.

1549
01:06:31,118 --> 01:06:32,201
I gotta get out there.

1550
01:06:32,202 --> 01:06:33,120
He'll get murdered.

1551
01:06:33,121 --> 01:06:34,787
He was pretty crazy
about her, wasn't he?

1552
01:06:34,788 --> 01:06:35,996
Who?

1553
01:06:35,997 --> 01:06:36,915
Rosita.

1554
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:38,624
I don't know what you mean.

1555
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:39,584
Oh, yes you do.

1556
01:06:39,585 --> 01:06:42,378
You met her at Hotspur Shaner's.

1557
01:06:42,379 --> 01:06:44,255
What gives you that idea?

1558
01:06:44,256 --> 01:06:45,090
You wouldn't know about it,

1559
01:06:45,091 --> 01:06:47,425
but it's on the same line in the book.

1560
01:06:47,426 --> 01:06:48,343
What book?

1561
01:06:48,344 --> 01:06:49,802
I said you wouldn't know about it.

1562
01:06:49,803 --> 01:06:52,430
He knew her as Helen Ransom, didn't he?

1563
01:06:52,431 --> 01:06:54,390
That's why he didn't
want him to see a picture

1564
01:06:54,391 --> 01:06:55,558
of her in the paper.

1565
01:06:55,559 --> 01:06:57,935
I don't know what you're talking about.

1566
01:06:57,936 --> 01:07:00,521
He'd get laughed out of
every ring in the country.

1567
01:07:00,522 --> 01:07:02,898
A wonderful comic character.

1568
01:07:02,899 --> 01:07:04,525
You'd better give, Jerry.

1569
01:07:04,526 --> 01:07:07,820
I'm gonna get it out of
you one way or another.

1570
01:07:07,821 --> 01:07:09,864
Look, is money any good in your racket?

1571
01:07:09,865 --> 01:07:11,157
No, not now, no.

1572
01:07:11,158 --> 01:07:14,160
Well, will you give us a break?

1573
01:07:14,161 --> 01:07:15,745
That all depends.

1574
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:17,872
Okay.

1575
01:07:17,873 --> 01:07:20,875
But now you gotta take care of me.

1576
01:07:20,876 --> 01:07:22,126
You know Shaner?

1577
01:07:22,127 --> 01:07:23,252
I spent the afternoon with him.

1578
01:07:23,253 --> 01:07:25,629
Well, we met the dame there all right.

1579
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:27,715
I've known the guy a long while,

1580
01:07:27,716 --> 01:07:30,217
I used to drop in and play chess with him.

1581
01:07:30,218 --> 01:07:32,761
But he kept her as a kind of a mystery.

1582
01:07:33,763 --> 01:07:35,806
It never bothered me, but it did Bat.

1583
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,892
He tried not to show it,
but he's about as tough

1584
01:07:37,893 --> 01:07:40,728
to read as a circus poster.

1585
01:07:40,729 --> 01:07:42,563
Thank you, my dear.

1586
01:07:42,564 --> 01:07:44,482
Can I get you a glass of beer?

1587
01:07:44,483 --> 01:07:46,066
No, thanks.

1588
01:07:46,067 --> 01:07:47,651
Well, good night.

1589
01:07:47,652 --> 01:07:48,737
Good night.

1590
01:07:56,578 --> 01:07:57,870
Bat, please!

1591
01:07:57,871 --> 01:08:00,080
Do you want me to raise a racket?

1592
01:08:00,081 --> 01:08:00,957
Bat, this is unfair.

1593
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:02,082
Sure it is.

1594
01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:03,001
When do I see you?

1595
01:08:03,002 --> 01:08:04,126
You don't.

1596
01:08:04,127 --> 01:08:05,753
Look, why can't I tell that old guy

1597
01:08:05,754 --> 01:08:07,421
so I can see you and take you out?

1598
01:08:07,422 --> 01:08:08,714
No, Bat.

1599
01:08:08,715 --> 01:08:09,549
What gives, anyway?

1600
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:11,259
What do you get out of living like this?

1601
01:08:11,301 --> 01:08:12,092
I told you before.

1602
01:08:12,093 --> 01:08:13,011
It doesn't matter.

1603
01:08:13,012 --> 01:08:14,053
Look, honey, I don't care

1604
01:08:14,054 --> 01:08:15,721
if you want to be a mystery woman,

1605
01:08:15,722 --> 01:08:19,058
you can be Joe Sawlings
niece, I don't care.

1606
01:08:22,812 --> 01:08:24,146
I figure it's easy.

1607
01:08:24,147 --> 01:08:26,065
Bat's been giving me trouble with dames

1608
01:08:26,066 --> 01:08:28,859
and here it is on a platter.

1609
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:31,278
The regular Blue-Plate Special.

1610
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,697
He was really daffy about her.

1611
01:08:33,698 --> 01:08:35,407
He'd hang around afternoons and drive her

1612
01:08:35,408 --> 01:08:38,994
to the stores, just to talk to her.

1613
01:08:38,995 --> 01:08:40,829
Can you figure?

1614
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:42,831
It's a perfect setup.

1615
01:08:42,832 --> 01:08:44,625
I could handle her.

1616
01:08:44,626 --> 01:08:47,878
She wouldn't be suing us
or wanting us to marry her.

1617
01:08:47,879 --> 01:08:50,297
I'm a wise guy, all right.

1618
01:08:50,298 --> 01:08:52,466
So I tell her the score.

1619
01:08:52,467 --> 01:08:53,592
She was a funny dame.

1620
01:08:53,593 --> 01:08:55,428
She didn't say a word.

1621
01:08:56,346 --> 01:08:58,305
Just put your hand in
the same glove, baby,

1622
01:08:58,306 --> 01:09:00,432
and believe me, it'll be a chance glove.

1623
01:09:00,433 --> 01:09:02,059
They can't stop it.

1624
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:05,938
And I guarantee it will
be well worth your while.

1625
01:09:05,939 --> 01:09:07,982
Don't get any cute ideas, though.

1626
01:09:07,983 --> 01:09:09,942
I'm running the show.

1627
01:09:09,943 --> 01:09:11,610
Any time you forget it,

1628
01:09:11,611 --> 01:09:13,487
I talk to Shaner and a few other parties

1629
01:09:13,488 --> 01:09:17,032
around town who might want to
know where you're hiding out.

1630
01:09:17,033 --> 01:09:18,032
Okay?

1631
01:09:20,495 --> 01:09:21,494
Okay.

1632
01:09:22,414 --> 01:09:25,040
And don't tell the old man we talked.

1633
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:25,834
No.

1634
01:09:25,835 --> 01:09:27,167
I'll handle him.

1635
01:09:27,168 --> 01:09:28,961
Trust Jerry Cavanaugh.

1636
01:09:28,962 --> 01:09:30,463
- Sure.
- So long.

1637
01:10:04,789 --> 01:10:06,624
She left Shaner.

1638
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:09,668
She wrote him a note that
didn't say much in blue.

1639
01:10:09,669 --> 01:10:11,837
It broke the old man all up.

1640
01:10:11,838 --> 01:10:14,673
And Bat, well, it worked okay.

1641
01:10:14,674 --> 01:10:18,010
But he finally tabbed her
for a phony and got mad.

1642
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:20,387
That's when he really started fighting.

1643
01:10:20,388 --> 01:10:23,558
Then tonight he reads about
her in the paper, that's all.

1644
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,851
He blamed himself and he blames me.

1645
01:10:25,852 --> 01:10:26,851
Can you figure?

1646
01:10:28,396 --> 01:10:29,230
Look!

1647
01:10:29,231 --> 01:10:31,440
I gotta get outta here.

1648
01:10:31,441 --> 01:10:32,441
Look, Adams, you'll give us a break.

1649
01:10:32,442 --> 01:10:34,485
You'll fix it for us, won't ya?

1650
01:10:34,486 --> 01:10:36,570
Yeah, sure.

1651
01:10:41,493 --> 01:10:43,578
Two, three, four, five.

1652
01:10:58,343 --> 01:11:01,179
Come on, break it up, break it up.

1653
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:07,185
One, two, three, four,

1654
01:11:10,021 --> 01:11:11,439
five, six, seven.

1655
01:11:17,404 --> 01:11:19,488
- Journal.
- Desk.

1656
01:11:19,489 --> 01:11:20,989
Hey, Ed, have you gone crazy?

1657
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:21,989
Where are you?

1658
01:11:22,659 --> 01:11:23,492
Hello.

1659
01:11:23,493 --> 01:11:24,327
It's Pig.

1660
01:11:24,328 --> 01:11:25,452
Cut him in.

1661
01:11:25,453 --> 01:11:26,246
Ed?

1662
01:11:26,287 --> 01:11:27,079
Pig just called in.

1663
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:27,913
I got him here now.

1664
01:11:27,914 --> 01:11:28,748
Hello, Pig.

1665
01:11:28,749 --> 01:11:29,873
- Hello, Ed?
- Yeah, Pig.

1666
01:11:29,874 --> 01:11:31,083
You were right, Great Heart.

1667
01:11:31,084 --> 01:11:32,084
Pig, for crying out-

1668
01:11:32,085 --> 01:11:33,669
Will you shut up,
George, and let me talk.

1669
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:34,504
Look, Ed,

1670
01:11:34,505 --> 01:11:35,963
I found Solly and followed him.

1671
01:11:35,964 --> 01:11:38,090
He met Temple in the suite at the Maywood.

1672
01:11:38,091 --> 01:11:39,258
That's where I am now.

1673
01:11:39,259 --> 01:11:40,676
They talked about 40 minutes.

1674
01:11:40,677 --> 01:11:42,636
Then Solly left down the stairs.

1675
01:11:42,637 --> 01:11:43,762
So I went for the elevator.

1676
01:11:43,763 --> 01:11:45,514
While I'm waiting I hear a shot.

1677
01:11:45,515 --> 01:11:49,893
So I went back to the room,
got in and found Temple,

1678
01:11:49,894 --> 01:11:52,479
on the floor with a
bullet through his head.

1679
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,565
- DOA.
- Pig, sit there.

1680
01:11:54,566 --> 01:11:55,607
Don't let anyone in.

1681
01:11:55,608 --> 01:11:57,568
Lock the doors, stay by the phone.

1682
01:11:57,569 --> 01:11:58,986
- Ed.
- Yeah?

1683
01:11:58,987 --> 01:12:00,279
Where are you?

1684
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,114
- At the stadium.
- What is it?

1685
01:12:01,115 --> 01:12:02,322
What have you got on him?

1686
01:12:02,323 --> 01:12:04,450
Temple was financing
Solly and his rackets.

1687
01:12:04,451 --> 01:12:05,784
- Is it proved?
- No,

1688
01:12:05,785 --> 01:12:08,078
but we can blow it wide open now.

1689
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:09,955
Give a tip for me, George.

1690
01:12:09,956 --> 01:12:12,040
Police are looking for Solly Wellman.

1691
01:12:12,041 --> 01:12:14,668
Last known address, 880, North State.

1692
01:12:14,669 --> 01:12:18,255
For the killings of Blacky
Franchot and John Spingler.

1693
01:12:18,256 --> 01:12:19,256
Are they?

1694
01:12:19,257 --> 01:12:20,507
They will be when they read it.

1695
01:12:20,508 --> 01:12:21,884
Well, what about Rosita?

1696
01:12:21,885 --> 01:12:23,343
What have you got on her?

1697
01:12:23,344 --> 01:12:24,928
And what was her angle on Temple?

1698
01:12:24,929 --> 01:12:27,931
Was Solly using her as a lever on Temple?

1699
01:12:27,932 --> 01:12:29,141
What about him?

1700
01:12:29,142 --> 01:12:33,062
- I'll call you back.
- Hey, what's the racket?

1701
01:12:43,031 --> 01:12:45,200
Is that him, Lieutenant?

1702
01:12:55,084 --> 01:12:55,919
No siren.

1703
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,002
I don't want to catch him.

1704
01:12:57,003 --> 01:12:59,171
And keep out of sight.

1705
01:13:26,157 --> 01:13:27,366
Hello, Belle.

1706
01:13:27,367 --> 01:13:28,366
I'm Adams.

1707
01:13:29,077 --> 01:13:29,911
Remember?

1708
01:13:29,912 --> 01:13:32,204
I'm the fellow that called
you yesterday about Rosita.

1709
01:13:32,205 --> 01:13:34,039
Didn't Solly mention it?

1710
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:35,332
Yeah, and he mentioned
you were trying hard

1711
01:13:35,333 --> 01:13:37,167
to get your head blown off.

1712
01:13:37,168 --> 01:13:39,044
I'm afraid it's the other way around.

1713
01:13:39,045 --> 01:13:41,797
A little while ago when he
left the suite of G.G. Temple

1714
01:13:41,798 --> 01:13:44,508
at the Maywood Hotel I
hear he got careless.

1715
01:13:44,509 --> 01:13:47,469
Got run over by a police
car, shot or something.

1716
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:49,805
I didn't have time to get it straight.

1717
01:13:49,806 --> 01:13:53,141
You were in such a hurry to let me know.

1718
01:13:53,142 --> 01:13:56,729
There'll be a news
broadcast in 15 minutes.

1719
01:13:58,189 --> 01:14:00,357
How did you find me?

1720
01:14:00,358 --> 01:14:01,525
What do you want?

1721
01:14:01,526 --> 01:14:03,151
A couple of answers.

1722
01:14:03,152 --> 01:14:04,486
Why pick on me?

1723
01:14:04,487 --> 01:14:06,822
I don't have anything
against you personally, Belle.

1724
01:14:06,823 --> 01:14:09,491
Except for your checking
out of the hotel like that.

1725
01:14:09,492 --> 01:14:12,202
As a matter of fact, I
feel very sorry for you.

1726
01:14:12,203 --> 01:14:13,287
So many do.

1727
01:14:13,288 --> 01:14:15,998
I'm a sentimental
guy, did you know that?

1728
01:14:15,999 --> 01:14:16,833
I've heard.

1729
01:14:16,834 --> 01:14:17,833
And you're in a jam.

1730
01:14:17,834 --> 01:14:19,252
Do you want help?

1731
01:14:20,587 --> 01:14:22,129
How?

1732
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:24,965
Oh, no, we trade first.

1733
01:14:24,966 --> 01:14:28,886
What happened between Rosita
and Temple when they broke up?

1734
01:14:28,887 --> 01:14:29,887
Who knows?

1735
01:14:29,888 --> 01:14:32,389
She couldn't stand living such a life.

1736
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:34,474
So, one of Solly's
men, Spingler by name,

1737
01:14:34,475 --> 01:14:37,477
took her to his uncle's and hid her out.

1738
01:14:37,478 --> 01:14:40,856
I don't know what you're talking about.

1739
01:14:40,857 --> 01:14:41,691
That's all right.

1740
01:14:41,692 --> 01:14:43,901
I know most of the story anyway.

1741
01:14:43,902 --> 01:14:46,778
I just want to get a few bridges from you.

1742
01:14:46,779 --> 01:14:47,778
Adams.

1743
01:14:48,781 --> 01:14:51,200
What do you know about Solly?

1744
01:14:52,744 --> 01:14:56,080
I know that he killed Blacky Franchot.

1745
01:14:57,290 --> 01:14:59,958
Why would he bother
with a drip like that?

1746
01:14:59,959 --> 01:15:01,752
He had to, Belle.

1747
01:15:01,753 --> 01:15:05,422
Have you any idea how Blacky
hated that boyfriend of yours?

1748
01:15:05,423 --> 01:15:07,799
You see, Blacky was in love with a girl.

1749
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,510
A girl that was going to
make everything up to him.

1750
01:15:10,511 --> 01:15:13,430
But Solly changed all of that.

1751
01:15:13,431 --> 01:15:16,224
You see, Temple had fallen for her.

1752
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:18,268
But it was just that drip
Blacky who was standing

1753
01:15:18,269 --> 01:15:19,354
in the way.

1754
01:15:19,395 --> 01:15:21,146
So Solly handled him.

1755
01:15:21,147 --> 01:15:24,566
He had Blacky beaten up and run out.

1756
01:15:24,567 --> 01:15:26,151
Everything's fine.

1757
01:15:26,152 --> 01:15:27,402
Solly's in the chips,

1758
01:15:27,403 --> 01:15:28,904
Blacky doesn't dare make a move

1759
01:15:28,905 --> 01:15:31,156
for fear they'll do something to Rosita.

1760
01:15:31,157 --> 01:15:32,908
Fine until he goes down to the morgue

1761
01:15:32,909 --> 01:15:35,118
and sees her lying there.

1762
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:38,664
From there on, it's
either Solly or Blacky.

1763
01:15:38,665 --> 01:15:40,457
And Solly knows that.

1764
01:15:40,458 --> 01:15:42,751
He gets there first.

1765
01:15:42,752 --> 01:15:43,836
I know how...

1766
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,926
You are a sentimental creature, Adams.

1767
01:15:50,927 --> 01:15:52,094
What are you?

1768
01:15:52,095 --> 01:15:55,430
A guy who'd break a girl apart for a buck.

1769
01:15:55,431 --> 01:15:58,809
Without enough guts, do
your own strong arming.

1770
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:01,228
Without enough guts, to stand
there unless some monkeys

1771
01:16:01,229 --> 01:16:02,479
behind you with a gun.

1772
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,064
You've talked enough.

1773
01:16:05,733 --> 01:16:06,567
You stupid fool!

1774
01:16:06,568 --> 01:16:07,901
Get out of here!

1775
01:16:07,902 --> 01:16:09,904
Open up, police!

1776
01:16:31,342 --> 01:16:32,593
I have to go,

1777
01:16:35,638 --> 01:16:37,473
I tried to explain, I,

1778
01:16:38,891 --> 01:16:41,394
Gribbe wouldn't understand me,

1779
01:16:42,603 --> 01:16:45,063
I got, I gotta finish.

1780
01:16:45,064 --> 01:16:47,065
Ed, please, don't.

1781
01:16:47,066 --> 01:16:51,069
I gotta wind it up, I gotta talk to him.

1782
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:55,032
Belle, Solly, I, don't you understand?

1783
01:16:55,033 --> 01:16:57,035
You'll have to go now.

1784
01:17:11,966 --> 01:17:14,593
I know you've arrested Belle Dorset.

1785
01:17:14,594 --> 01:17:17,387
That was a fine catch, an unarmed woman.

1786
01:17:17,388 --> 01:17:19,222
But what about Solly Wellman?

1787
01:17:19,223 --> 01:17:20,016
Where is he?

1788
01:17:20,017 --> 01:17:21,892
Do you realize one of my men was shot?

1789
01:17:21,893 --> 01:17:23,977
Do you think I'm gonna
quiddle my thumb while-

1790
01:17:23,978 --> 01:17:24,812
George!

1791
01:17:24,813 --> 01:17:26,688
Holan can't get a thing out of Belle.

1792
01:17:26,689 --> 01:17:28,482
Tell him to stay there until he does.

1793
01:17:28,483 --> 01:17:29,775
Send Gorin over.

1794
01:17:29,776 --> 01:17:30,984
- Beat it out of her.
- Take it easy, George.

1795
01:17:30,985 --> 01:17:32,861
We got her all squared up.

1796
01:17:32,862 --> 01:17:34,863
We should have him in a matter of hours.

1797
01:17:34,864 --> 01:17:36,573
Like Anstruder got him?

1798
01:17:36,574 --> 01:17:38,325
He walks right out of his hands

1799
01:17:38,326 --> 01:17:39,618
and you can't find a trace of him.

1800
01:17:39,619 --> 01:17:42,370
What kind of Police Department
are you running down there?

1801
01:17:42,371 --> 01:17:43,705
A man doesn't just get
up out of a hospital bed

1802
01:17:43,706 --> 01:17:46,458
and then walk out without
anyone seeing him.

1803
01:17:46,459 --> 01:17:47,584
Apparently this man did.

1804
01:17:47,585 --> 01:17:48,710
But doctor, I told you.

1805
01:17:48,711 --> 01:17:50,879
I brought him his
breakfast at seven o'clock

1806
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,631
and then half an hour later his friend-

1807
01:17:52,632 --> 01:17:53,632
Friend?

1808
01:17:53,633 --> 01:17:54,716
Pig, the fool!

1809
01:17:54,717 --> 01:17:55,801
The man is out of his senses.

1810
01:17:55,802 --> 01:17:57,427
He's in a serious condition.

1811
01:17:57,428 --> 01:17:59,346
Doctor, please, may I use the phone?

1812
01:17:59,347 --> 01:18:02,475
I refuse any further responsibility.

1813
01:18:28,251 --> 01:18:29,668
Well?

1814
01:18:29,669 --> 01:18:31,336
What's the matter with the old Sol?

1815
01:18:31,337 --> 01:18:33,255
Why did you tell me they got Solly?

1816
01:18:33,256 --> 01:18:36,007
Not till I can show
him to you in the morgue.

1817
01:18:36,008 --> 01:18:38,552
You're too afraid of
him, you know you are.

1818
01:18:38,553 --> 01:18:41,054
You'd be too if you had sense.

1819
01:18:41,055 --> 01:18:42,222
You hate him, don't you, Belle?

1820
01:18:42,223 --> 01:18:44,307
You won't get anything out of me.

1821
01:18:44,308 --> 01:18:45,643
Deadly afraid.

1822
01:18:46,519 --> 01:18:47,561
All right, come on.

1823
01:18:47,562 --> 01:18:48,396
Where?

1824
01:18:48,397 --> 01:18:49,938
Take a little ride
to the funeral parlor.

1825
01:18:49,939 --> 01:18:50,773
Oh, no!

1826
01:18:50,774 --> 01:18:51,773
Maybe if you see Rosita.

1827
01:18:51,774 --> 01:18:52,608
I won't!

1828
01:18:52,609 --> 01:18:53,985
You can't make me.

1829
01:18:54,026 --> 01:18:55,527
You can take her, Pig.

1830
01:18:55,528 --> 01:18:57,070
Oh, no, you can't!

1831
01:18:57,071 --> 01:18:58,488
If they see me going down there with you,

1832
01:18:58,489 --> 01:19:00,240
they'll be sure I've talked.

1833
01:19:00,241 --> 01:19:01,075
That's the general idea.

1834
01:19:01,076 --> 01:19:02,784
- Come on.
- Oh, no, no!

1835
01:19:02,785 --> 01:19:04,370
One or the other.

1836
01:19:06,581 --> 01:19:08,123
What do you want?

1837
01:19:08,124 --> 01:19:10,876
Not much and I'll keep you in the clear.

1838
01:19:10,877 --> 01:19:13,503
You see, they're burying
Rosita this morning.

1839
01:19:13,504 --> 01:19:14,880
Her brother will be there
and a few other people

1840
01:19:14,881 --> 01:19:16,339
that loved her.

1841
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:20,428
I'd like it fine if I
didn't have to lie to them.

1842
01:19:28,352 --> 01:19:30,937
Now tell me about the
night Temple got drunk.

1843
01:19:30,938 --> 01:19:33,023
He talked too much
because he always got crazy

1844
01:19:33,024 --> 01:19:34,316
when he drank.

1845
01:19:34,317 --> 01:19:36,693
He told Rosita what they'd done to Blacky.

1846
01:19:36,694 --> 01:19:38,445
She was gonna walk out on him.

1847
01:19:38,446 --> 01:19:39,821
Temple knocked her down.

1848
01:19:39,822 --> 01:19:41,865
He thought he'd killed her.

1849
01:19:41,866 --> 01:19:43,742
He got panicky.

1850
01:19:43,743 --> 01:19:45,702
He called Solly like a fool.

1851
01:19:45,703 --> 01:19:48,246
You know what Solly'd do with that.

1852
01:19:48,247 --> 01:19:49,207
You tell me.

1853
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:50,540
Temple passed out.

1854
01:19:50,541 --> 01:19:53,251
Later on, Solly told him he had killed her

1855
01:19:53,252 --> 01:19:54,753
then gotten rid of her.

1856
01:19:54,754 --> 01:19:57,047
That wrapped Temple up for Solly.

1857
01:19:57,048 --> 01:19:59,841
He was such a wise guy.

1858
01:19:59,842 --> 01:20:02,636
But he actually intended
to get rid of her.

1859
01:20:02,637 --> 01:20:05,889
Spingler, he'd always liked her.

1860
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:08,892
And the wise guy was dumb
enough to get him to do it.

1861
01:20:08,893 --> 01:20:12,145
So Spingler double-crosses
Solly, takes the girl

1862
01:20:12,146 --> 01:20:15,023
and hides her out at his uncle's.

1863
01:20:15,024 --> 01:20:18,902
Solly thinks he's got her
out of the way permanently.

1864
01:20:18,903 --> 01:20:20,528
He's riding high.

1865
01:20:20,529 --> 01:20:24,699
Until she shows up at the
morgue some eight months later.

1866
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:27,119
And I start asking questions.

1867
01:20:28,955 --> 01:20:29,914
Thanks, Belle.

1868
01:20:29,915 --> 01:20:31,581
You said you'd keep me clear.

1869
01:20:31,582 --> 01:20:32,500
I will.

1870
01:20:32,501 --> 01:20:34,418
Nobody crosses Solly.

1871
01:20:50,434 --> 01:20:52,186
Step on it, driver.

1872
01:20:53,062 --> 01:20:54,604
Don't turn around!

1873
01:20:59,652 --> 01:21:02,112
Nobody crosses Solly.

1874
01:21:02,113 --> 01:21:03,197
She meant us.

1875
01:21:10,162 --> 01:21:11,998
Hurry it up, driver.

1876
01:21:13,249 --> 01:21:14,416
Hey, you know something?

1877
01:21:14,417 --> 01:21:16,835
We're like a couple of clay pigeons.

1878
01:21:18,879 --> 01:21:21,215
Hey, what's going on here?

1879
01:21:22,925 --> 01:21:23,925
Nothing doing.

1880
01:21:23,926 --> 01:21:25,176
If I pull up they blast.

1881
01:21:25,177 --> 01:21:27,637
I'm ain't gonna be no innocent bystander.

1882
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,559
Split out the next alley.

1883
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:33,394
We'll jump.

1884
01:21:33,395 --> 01:21:35,103
You better jump fast, buddy.

1885
01:21:35,104 --> 01:21:36,063
You get the cops.

1886
01:21:36,064 --> 01:21:38,733
I don't think they'll see you.

1887
01:22:01,005 --> 01:22:02,256
Get the door.

1888
01:22:03,132 --> 01:22:04,591
Come on.

1889
01:22:04,592 --> 01:22:06,593
Get in there.

1890
01:22:18,272 --> 01:22:20,273
Come on, get out of here.

1891
01:22:20,274 --> 01:22:21,273
On top!

1892
01:22:27,573 --> 01:22:29,075
Check that door!

1893
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:35,413
- It's locked.
- Come on!

1894
01:23:43,441 --> 01:23:45,358
How many left?

1895
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:46,358
One.

1896
01:23:58,956 --> 01:24:01,040
All right, Adams.

1897
01:24:01,041 --> 01:24:02,042
Come on out.

1898
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:36,951
Forget what I said to
you before, will you?

1899
01:24:36,952 --> 01:24:38,244
Sure.

1900
01:24:38,245 --> 01:24:40,413
Are you gonna finish this?

1901
01:24:40,414 --> 01:24:42,207
It's yours if you want it.

1902
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:46,461
I think you're the only
one that ever understood it.

1903
01:24:46,462 --> 01:24:47,755
Thanks, Tommy.

1904
01:24:54,011 --> 01:24:55,010
Ed.

1905
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:56,722
Are you crazy?

1906
01:24:56,723 --> 01:24:58,973
Are you trying to kill yourself?

1907
01:24:58,974 --> 01:25:00,225
I've been frantic.

1908
01:25:00,226 --> 01:25:02,060
Are you all right, Ed?

1909
01:25:02,061 --> 01:25:05,689
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Take your seats, please.

1910
01:25:07,066 --> 01:25:10,235
Please, please, sit down over here.

1911
01:25:10,236 --> 01:25:11,653
You must come with me.

1912
01:25:11,654 --> 01:25:13,613
You must come back to the hospital.

1913
01:25:13,614 --> 01:25:15,282
No, just a minute.

1914
01:25:17,535 --> 01:25:22,373
If you won't do it for me,
Ed, I know she'd want you to.

1915
01:25:24,917 --> 01:25:27,919
You're a good kid, Leona.

1916
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,879
Get a car out in front for me, will you?

1917
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,839
Are you sure you're all right?

1918
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:34,593
Yeah, I'm all right, but hurry.

1919
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:41,015
Look down upon us, our Heavenly Father,

1920
01:25:41,016 --> 01:25:46,021
and in Your tender mercy show
compassion for our frailty.

1921
01:25:46,397 --> 01:25:51,235
Show those who sorrow here the
means to bear their sorrow.

1922
01:25:52,945 --> 01:25:55,154
Strengthen the afflicted.

1923
01:25:55,155 --> 01:25:59,326
Take into Thy keeping her,
whom we knew and loved.
