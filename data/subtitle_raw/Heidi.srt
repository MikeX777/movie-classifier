1
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,660
Heidi!

2
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,100
Put those on!

3
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,460
Oh, not everything. I'm so hot.

4
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,940
Well, keep on your Sunday dress...

5
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,100
and your coat.

6
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,540
- Hurry up!
- Oh, all right.

7
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:02,779
Come a long way?

8
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:04,420
Yes. From Mayenfeld.

9
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,379
We had a ride part of the way on a cart.

10
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,219
Can you tell me the way to Adolph Kramer's?

11
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,859
Did you say Adolph Kramer?

12
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:17,100
I did.

13
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,299
A stranger hereabouts, aren't you?

14
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:21,900
Yes. Why?

15
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:23,580
You must be, or you would have...

16
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,580
nothing to do with that old heathen!

17
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,140
Heathen or not, I'm taking his
granddaughter to live with him.

18
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,579
Well do you know what kind of a man he is?

19
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:34,460
That's none of my affair.
Which path do I take?

20
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,899
There, by the church.

21
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:38,019
If you listen to us, you'll never take it.

22
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,540
Um-

23
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:12,379
Umm.

24
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:28,459
Hey! Turk!

25
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:38,579
Everybody knows you can't
turn your back on old Turk.

26
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:41,739
Well, old Turk isn't much of a gentleman.

27
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:44,059
What's your name?

28
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:45,899
I'm Peter, the goat general.

29
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,019
Who are you?

30
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:52,138
I'm Heidi, and I'm going to live
with Adolph Kramer, my grandfather.

31
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,699
Live with him? Aren't you scared to?

32
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:58,019
Why should I be afraid of my grandfather?

33
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,939
You'll find out. If ever
he gets good and mad at you...

34
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:04,499
he'll probably cut your head off.

35
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:05,699
Like this!

36
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:07,739
Oh.

37
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:09,218
I don't care what you say.

38
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:11,739
She's my niece, and I can
do what I please with her.

39
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:16,219
Come along. Come along. Hurry!

40
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:35,378
I'm Dete, the sister of Gretchen...

41
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:37,859
who married your son Tobias.

42
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,258
I've brought their orphan to live with you.

43
00:05:41,378 --> 00:05:43,618
I've taken care ofher for six years...

44
00:05:43,698 --> 00:05:46,098
but I've got a job in Frankfurt now-

45
00:05:46,218 --> 00:05:48,218
a rich family-

46
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:50,818
and I can't be bothered with her anymore,

47
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:53,858
I know you hated Tobias and Gretchen...

48
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:55,978
but you've got to take
their daughter just the same.

49
00:05:58,378 --> 00:06:00,658
Get out of here.

50
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:05,178
Here she is! Her name's Heidi!

51
00:06:13,818 --> 00:06:16,098
How do you do, Grandfather?

52
00:06:16,218 --> 00:06:18,658
I'm very glad to see you.

53
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:28,738
Aren't you going to show me our house?

54
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:51,538
Oh. It's a very fine house, isn't it?

55
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,017
Whew!

56
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:33,698
Where am I going to sleep?

57
00:07:56,657 --> 00:07:59,738
Grandfather! I found my bed.

58
00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:02,817
I'll sleep on the hay.

59
00:08:12,298 --> 00:08:15,857
But I suppose I ought
to have a sheet and coverlet.

60
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:22,337
I say, I suppose I ought
to have a sheet and coverlet.

61
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:26,697
Well...

62
00:08:26,777 --> 00:08:28,697
I've always had a sheet and coverlet...

63
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:32,217
but if there aren't any,
I could sleep under the hay.

64
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:37,577
Could I use these?

65
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:15,977
Grandfather, it's a beautiful bed.

66
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,777
Would you like to come and see?

67
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,217
Oh! Is that for me?

68
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:31,096
Thank you.

69
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:00,256
Ow.

70
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:06,336
Now I've got a table all my own.

71
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:18,696
Hello, laddie.
Is this Blind Anna's cottage?

72
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:22,216
- Yes. She's my grandmother.
- Thank you.

73
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:28,696
I do not know this Adolph Kramer,
but the village thinks...

74
00:11:28,816 --> 00:11:30,696
the child should be taken away from him.

75
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:33,056
You've just come to Dorfli, Herr Pastor...

76
00:11:33,136 --> 00:11:35,416
or you'd understand why.

77
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:38,575
They say you have known
Kramer for 50 years.

78
00:11:38,695 --> 00:11:41,936
- What sort of a man is he?
- Who knows?

79
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:46,096
He was a grand young man,
except for his wild temper.

80
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:49,896
And his son grew up just like him.

81
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:53,575
Tobias wanted to marry
a girl from Mayenfeld.

82
00:11:53,695 --> 00:11:58,856
Adolph disliked her and forbade it,
but the boy married her...

83
00:11:58,976 --> 00:12:02,095
just the same and brought her home,

84
00:12:02,215 --> 00:12:04,615
Adolph turned them away in a rage...

85
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:08,215
and told Tobias never to come back...

86
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:11,095
until he'd given up the girl.

87
00:12:11,215 --> 00:12:14,256
But why should the village
hate him and fear him so?

88
00:12:14,336 --> 00:12:18,895
Feuds and weeds grow quickly, Herr Pastor.

89
00:12:18,975 --> 00:12:22,376
The people of the village
sided with the boy...

90
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:24,535
and the father cursed them...

91
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:29,575
and went and built himself
a hut on the mountain.

92
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:33,616
Since that day, he's never
spoken to a living soul.

93
00:12:33,736 --> 00:12:37,215
Frau Anna, is the child safe with him?

94
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:39,255
God knows.

95
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:43,895
Living alone like that
has made him a strange creature.

96
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:51,415
I like to hear the church bells,
don't you, Grandfather?

97
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:55,775
- Get to bed.
- Shall I say my prayers out here with you?

98
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:59,175
- I told you to go to bed!
- Yes, Grandfather.

99
00:13:01,536 --> 00:13:04,855
I think I'll go to bed now,
Grandfather. Good night!

100
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:12,055
And God bless Grandfather,
and please make him like me.

101
00:13:12,135 --> 00:13:15,215
And please make me
a good little girl. Amen.

102
00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:23,535
And please make Aunt Dete stay
in Frankfurt for a long, long time.

103
00:13:23,655 --> 00:13:25,895
Amen.

104
00:14:12,814 --> 00:14:17,174
- Is this for me?
- Yes.

105
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:22,455
It's the most beautifulest
chair I ever saw.

106
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:24,455
Thank you, - Mm.

107
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:33,375
- What are you making?
- Cheese.

108
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:35,335
Could I help?

109
00:14:38,454 --> 00:14:40,534
Stir.

110
00:14:40,654 --> 00:14:42,974
Do please help me tie my apron.

111
00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:52,294
Agh!

112
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:03,294
Thank you.

113
00:15:10,774 --> 00:15:13,174
- Are these ours, Grandfather?
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:15:13,254 --> 00:15:15,974
- What are their names?
- Swanly and Bearly.

115
00:15:16,094 --> 00:15:18,574
You don't look much like a swan...

116
00:15:18,694 --> 00:15:20,614
and you don't look anything like a bear.

117
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:22,974
I think you're a beautiful goat.

118
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:25,774
I wonder if you give black milk?

119
00:15:25,854 --> 00:15:29,253
- You can milk Bearly.
- But I don't know how to milk a goat.

120
00:15:29,373 --> 00:15:32,894
Well, then, it's time
you learned. This way.

121
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:09,973
You may as well stand still.
I'm going to do it.

122
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:17,334
Oh, please, Swanly. Don't be so st-

123
00:16:17,414 --> 00:16:20,214
stubborn.

124
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,334
Oh!

125
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:33,853
Bearly's a very warm goat, isn't she?

126
00:16:58,453 --> 00:17:00,894
Pretty hard work, isn't it, Grandfather?

127
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:02,974
Is this the last load?

128
00:17:03,094 --> 00:17:07,534
Not quite. The rabbit's fur
is thick. It'll be a hard winter.

129
00:17:30,813 --> 00:17:32,973
We don't care if it's a hard winter, do we?

130
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,013
There's wood to keep us warm
and cheese to eat...

131
00:17:36,093 --> 00:17:38,013
and lots of hay for Swanly and Bearly.

132
00:17:55,613 --> 00:17:58,093
May I go with Peter today?

133
00:17:58,213 --> 00:18:00,773
It may be the last time before the snows.

134
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:03,013
All right. All right.

135
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:05,692
But be back early for your lessons.

136
00:18:05,812 --> 00:18:08,213
I will.

137
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:11,413
Are you sure you can get along without me?

138
00:18:13,253 --> 00:18:15,213
I'll try.

139
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:50,332
- You're supposed to be asleep.
- My eyes couldn't stay shut.

140
00:18:50,452 --> 00:18:52,492
Look what I found!

141
00:18:56,453 --> 00:18:58,333
Well.

142
00:18:58,453 --> 00:19:00,853
Do you think there's any music left in it?

143
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:02,933
We'll see.

144
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:12,612
I'm afraid it's all tired out.

145
00:19:12,732 --> 00:19:14,692
Hm.

146
00:19:18,652 --> 00:19:19,772
Oh!

147
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,972
This looks like a wonderful story!

148
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:24,453
What's it about?

149
00:19:24,532 --> 00:19:28,092
It's about magic wooden shoes.

150
00:19:28,212 --> 00:19:30,893
All right, Grandfather, I'm ready.

151
00:19:31,012 --> 00:19:33,772
Now...

152
00:19:33,892 --> 00:19:37,332
a long, long time ago...

153
00:19:37,412 --> 00:19:40,452
there was a little Dutch girl named Netje,

154
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:52,052
Have you seen my new shoes

155
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:54,252
They are made out of wood

156
00:19:54,372 --> 00:19:56,412
Such nice little shoes

157
00:19:56,532 --> 00:19:58,851
Don't you think they look good

158
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:01,211
I can dance all around

159
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:03,492
With the greatest of ease

160
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:05,652
I can jump from the ground

161
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,972
To the top of the trees

162
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:15,532
I'll tell you something I'm going to try

163
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:19,332
Put on your shoes and away we'll fly

164
00:20:22,491 --> 00:20:25,852
We'll take a trip wherever we choose

165
00:20:25,972 --> 00:20:29,572
We'll dance and skip
in our little wooden shoes

166
00:20:44,051 --> 00:20:47,892
How many miles will you travel with me

167
00:20:47,971 --> 00:20:51,372
One mile or two miles and maybe three

168
00:20:51,492 --> 00:20:55,211
We'll make a stop wherever we choose

169
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:58,931
We'll skip and hop
in our little wooden shoes

170
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:27,771
Wasn't our journey a nice holiday

171
00:22:27,891 --> 00:22:31,571
We'll take another some other day

172
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:36,171
We'll take a trip wherever we choose

173
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:44,170
We'll dance and skip
in our little wooden shoes

174
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,730
- Hello.
- Oh!

175
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:26,131
- You come to see us?
- Yes, dear.

176
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,570
- I am Pastor Schultz.
- How do you do, Pastor Schultz?

177
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,850
How do you do, Frau Schultz?

178
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,890
Oh, no. I'm Fraulein Elsa,
the schoolmistress.

179
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,011
Oh, you'd make a very nice Frau Schultz.

180
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:44,210
You're mending
your grandfather's coat. How nice.

181
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:48,050
It's his Sunday coat, but he never
wears it. He doesn't go to church.

182
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,930
Perhaps we could persuade him to go,
Would you like that?

183
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,330
The pastor and Fraulein Elsa
have come to see us. Isn't that nice?

184
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,330
- Good day, neighbor.
- Well?

185
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,210
- We've come to ask about the child.
- Go inside, Heidi.

186
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,890
Save your breath.
I have nothing to say to you.

187
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,850
- That seems to settle it.
- No, it doesn't.

188
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:22,450
I'm sorry to insist, neighbor,
but school will open soon.

189
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:26,449
- I'll not send Heidi to school.
- What will you do with her, then?

190
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:29,450
She will thrive up here
with the goats and the birds.

191
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,969
- What will she learn from them?
- At least she will learn no evil!

192
00:24:33,089 --> 00:24:35,970
That's hardly enough schooling for a child.

193
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,970
I'll teach her all that's necessary.

194
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,290
And you'll teach her religion too?

195
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:43,489
The mountains will teach her
the only religion worth having...

196
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:45,769
as I have found out.

197
00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:49,570
Come back to Dorfli, neighbor. This is
no life up here for you and the child-

198
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,530
at enmity with God and man.

199
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:55,610
I know what they think of me in Dorfli,
and they know what I think of them.

200
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:01,770
- It's better that we keep apart.
- I should not like to appeal to the law.

201
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:06,889
Heidi shall not go to school
or to church, either. That is final!

202
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:09,569
I'm sorry, neighbor. May God help you.

203
00:25:09,689 --> 00:25:12,650
And if any man try
to take Heidi away from me...

204
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,930
God help him, !

205
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:22,049
I used to go to Sunday school
when I lived in Mayenfeld.

206
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:29,809
Are you going to be my
Sunday school teacher too?

207
00:27:37,848 --> 00:27:40,249
We'll have our first lesson now.

208
00:27:56,048 --> 00:27:58,608
I'd like to read this story. Shall I?

209
00:28:03,488 --> 00:28:05,528
"A certain man had two sons...

210
00:28:05,648 --> 00:28:07,928
and the...

211
00:28:08,008 --> 00:28:12,608
Y- O-U-N-G-E-R-"

212
00:28:12,728 --> 00:28:14,048
Younger.

213
00:28:14,168 --> 00:28:18,208
"And the younger of them
said to his father...

214
00:28:18,328 --> 00:28:23,568
'Father, give me the P-O-R-"'

215
00:28:23,647 --> 00:28:25,568
These are pretty hard words.

216
00:28:25,648 --> 00:28:27,568
Perhaps you'd better help me.

217
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:34,048
"Give me the portion of goods
that fall unto me."

218
00:28:34,168 --> 00:28:37,888
And he divided unto them his levy...

219
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:41,408
and the younger son
gathered all together...

220
00:28:41,528 --> 00:28:44,128
and took his journey into a far country.

221
00:28:44,248 --> 00:28:47,167
You know this story by heart.

222
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:49,247
Yes. By heart.

223
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:52,328
Does the son ever go home to his father?

224
00:28:53,847 --> 00:28:54,928
And the son said...

225
00:28:55,008 --> 00:28:56,928
"Father, I have sinned against heaven...

226
00:28:57,048 --> 00:28:58,768
and in thy sight...

227
00:28:58,848 --> 00:29:03,528
and am no more worthy
to be called thy son."

228
00:29:03,648 --> 00:29:05,848
But the father said to his servants...

229
00:29:05,968 --> 00:29:09,368
"Bring forth the best robe,
and put it on him...

230
00:29:09,488 --> 00:29:13,367
and put a ring on his hand
and shoes on his feet...

231
00:29:13,487 --> 00:29:18,528
for this my son was dead
and is alive again.

232
00:29:18,648 --> 00:29:20,888
He was lost...

233
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:25,008
and is found."

234
00:29:36,327 --> 00:29:39,247
"If a man have a hundred sheep...

235
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:43,247
and one of them be gone astray...

236
00:29:43,327 --> 00:29:46,728
doth he not leave the 90 and 9...

237
00:29:46,848 --> 00:29:49,567
and goeth into the mountains...

238
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,567
and seeketh that which has gone astray?

239
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,168
And if-"

240
00:30:16,687 --> 00:30:18,767
Peter, what is it?

241
00:30:18,887 --> 00:30:22,647
The grandfather and Heidi
have come to church.

242
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:29,407
"And if so be that he find it...

243
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,087
verily, I say unto you...

244
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:35,087
he rejoiceth more of that sheep...

245
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,567
than of the 90 and 9
which went not astray."

246
00:30:44,447 --> 00:30:52,447
Holy God we praise thy name

247
00:30:53,967 --> 00:31:01,967
Lord of all we bow before thee

248
00:31:03,407 --> 00:31:11,407
All on earth thy scepter claim

249
00:31:12,966 --> 00:31:20,966
All in heaven above adore thee

250
00:31:22,527 --> 00:31:30,527
Fill the heavens with sweet accord

251
00:31:31,966 --> 00:31:39,966
Holy, holy holy, Lord

252
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:45,646
Holy

253
00:31:45,766 --> 00:31:53,766
Holy, holy Lord

254
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:57,407
Good day, Adolph.

255
00:31:57,487 --> 00:31:58,487
Good day.

256
00:31:58,526 --> 00:32:00,606
Good to see you and the child.

257
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,166
You're looking well.

258
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:06,206
Here comes the grandfather now.

259
00:32:06,326 --> 00:32:10,127
So the old eagle
has come down from his perch.

260
00:32:10,247 --> 00:32:12,207
It was lonely for Heidi.

261
00:32:12,327 --> 00:32:15,166
Adolph, you're an old fraud.

262
00:32:15,286 --> 00:32:17,566
Don't give me away.

263
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,206
Well-

264
00:32:23,166 --> 00:32:26,886
I ask the Herr Pastor to forgive
the words I said on the mountain.

265
00:32:27,006 --> 00:32:30,406
The words are forgotten, neighbor.
This is a happy day for all of us.

266
00:32:30,486 --> 00:32:33,406
I hope we shall see you here often.

267
00:32:33,486 --> 00:32:37,126
- What do you say, Heidi?
- Well, I think everybody...

268
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:39,246
really ought to go to church on Sunday...

269
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:42,326
and I think there
ought to be a Frau Schultz.

270
00:33:06,005 --> 00:33:10,365
Aunt Dete, what-what do you want here?

271
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:12,326
Where's your grandfather?

272
00:33:12,445 --> 00:33:15,886
He's up on the mountain cutting some logs.

273
00:33:16,006 --> 00:33:18,805
Get on your coat and mittens.
We're going away.

274
00:33:18,925 --> 00:33:20,766
I don't want to go away!

275
00:33:20,846 --> 00:33:23,565
- What?
- I want to stay here.

276
00:33:23,685 --> 00:33:26,526
I love the grandfather, and he loves me.

277
00:33:26,606 --> 00:33:29,166
It's my birthday,
and we're going to have a party.

278
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:33,006
Look. He made me these for a present.

279
00:33:33,086 --> 00:33:37,086
There's Swanly and Bearly. And we're going down
to the village to get sausage and butter...

280
00:33:37,206 --> 00:33:39,086
because the grandmother
and Peter are coming.

281
00:33:39,206 --> 00:33:42,645
Well, he won't mind you
going on a little trip with me.

282
00:33:42,765 --> 00:33:45,445
- Where?
- Just to Frankfurt.

283
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:47,525
You can come back whenever you like.

284
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:49,926
- I don't want to go to Frankfurt.
- You will do as I say!

285
00:33:50,046 --> 00:33:52,966
- Where are your clothes?
- I've got to ask the grandfather first.

286
00:33:53,045 --> 00:33:55,965
- Where are they?
- In there.

287
00:33:57,885 --> 00:34:01,326
Now, there is nothing to worry about.

288
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:05,726
We'll have a sleigh ride to Mayenfeld
and a nice trip on a train.

289
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:08,245
And I'll buy you a present
for your birthday.

290
00:34:08,325 --> 00:34:12,565
- Can I come right back for my party?
- Didn't I tell you you could?

291
00:34:12,685 --> 00:34:15,565
Can I bring some soft rolls
for the grandmother?

292
00:34:15,685 --> 00:34:18,125
You see, she hasn't many teeth
and can't eat her black bread.

293
00:34:18,246 --> 00:34:20,526
Oh, yes. Come! Hurry up! Hurry up!

294
00:34:20,646 --> 00:34:23,105
First, I must go up the mountain
and tell the grandfather where I'm going.

295
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:26,325
There isn't time. We might miss our train!
I'll send word back to him!

296
00:34:26,405 --> 00:34:28,365
But I'd rather tell him myself.

297
00:34:33,245 --> 00:34:36,925
Do you think if I put
my birthday shoes by the fire...

298
00:34:37,005 --> 00:34:40,125
- he'd know I'm coming back?
- Yes, yes, of course.

299
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,245
Now, come along!

300
00:35:01,205 --> 00:35:03,565
Heidi?

301
00:35:14,484 --> 00:35:16,644
Heidi?

302
00:35:21,485 --> 00:35:23,485
Heidi!

303
00:35:25,845 --> 00:35:29,884
Heidi! Where are you?

304
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:50,565
- Good day, little Heidi.
- Good day, Herr Pastor.

305
00:35:50,645 --> 00:35:53,885
- Are you going away?
- Yes, to Frankfurt with Aunt Dete.

306
00:35:54,005 --> 00:35:57,404
I'm taking her for a little trip,
Herr Pastor. It's her birthday.

307
00:35:57,484 --> 00:36:02,084
- Oh, how kind of you. Pleasant journey to you, Fraulein.
- Thank you.

308
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:08,524
Oh, there's the grandfather.
I must go tell him.

309
00:36:08,604 --> 00:36:12,924
- Sit down! Drive on!
- Grandfather!

310
00:36:13,044 --> 00:36:15,524
Have you seen her? Heidi! She's gone!

311
00:36:15,645 --> 00:36:18,524
Don't you know?
Her aunt has taken her to Frankfurt.

312
00:36:18,604 --> 00:36:20,684
She's stolen her! Where are they?

313
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,764
Stolen? There.

314
00:36:25,204 --> 00:36:27,364
Heidi!

315
00:36:54,324 --> 00:36:57,724
- I don't think I'll go any farther.
- Oh, yes, you will.

316
00:37:16,124 --> 00:37:18,324
Aunt Dete, tell them to stop!

317
00:37:18,443 --> 00:37:20,843
Keep quiet. I can't stop the train.

318
00:37:20,964 --> 00:37:24,364
You've got to. It's getting late.
I'll never get back tonight!

319
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:27,924
Of course you won't.
Sit down and keep still.

320
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:34,764
- Then you-you knew all the time?
- Well, what if I did?

321
00:37:37,803 --> 00:37:41,204
There's going to be
sausage and butter at my party...

322
00:37:41,284 --> 00:37:43,684
and I won't be there.

323
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:46,603
And-And the grandfather will be lonely.

324
00:38:26,644 --> 00:38:28,804
Do you remember what I told you?

325
00:38:28,884 --> 00:38:30,964
I'm to say to the lady...

326
00:38:31,044 --> 00:38:33,124
"How do you do, Fraulein Rottenmeier?"

327
00:38:33,243 --> 00:38:36,283
And to Klara,
"How do you do, Fraulein Klara?

328
00:38:36,403 --> 00:38:39,284
I hope you will be well soon."

329
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:41,604
But why are we going to their house?

330
00:38:41,724 --> 00:38:44,123
You'll find out when we get there.

331
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:05,723
"The quality of a young lady's breeding...

332
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:09,203
is indicated by her deportment
when elders are present.

333
00:39:09,283 --> 00:39:13,563
At such times, her manner
should be sedate and diffident."

334
00:39:13,683 --> 00:39:16,042
It's time for them to be here, Fraulein.

335
00:39:16,122 --> 00:39:19,403
Remember, Klara, no excitement.

336
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:22,403
You're still an invalid.

337
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:24,722
"The habit of interruption...

338
00:39:24,843 --> 00:39:26,722
should always be frowned upon.

339
00:39:26,842 --> 00:39:31,042
The well-bred young lady always
waits until her elders are silent."

340
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:33,442
I wonder what she'll be like.

341
00:39:33,563 --> 00:39:36,843
Your father expects a healthy,
unspoiled, mountain child...

342
00:39:36,923 --> 00:39:40,243
of your age to share your studies.

343
00:39:40,363 --> 00:39:43,683
Personally, I think
the whole plan is a mistake.

344
00:39:43,803 --> 00:39:47,603
Papa thought it might be good
for me to have a playmate.

345
00:39:47,683 --> 00:39:50,762
But you have me.

346
00:39:50,882 --> 00:39:53,563
Don't I give you my entire
time and devotion?

347
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:57,563
Yes, and it's very kind of you...

348
00:39:57,683 --> 00:39:59,883
but I don't have much fun.

349
00:40:02,683 --> 00:40:04,843
Whoa!

350
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:21,403
Now, remember.

351
00:40:24,482 --> 00:40:26,483
My word!

352
00:40:32,483 --> 00:40:34,563
Well, come on.

353
00:40:34,683 --> 00:40:37,083
Announce us.

354
00:40:37,163 --> 00:40:39,482
Where did you pick up that?

355
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:43,762
- That is my niece.
- How unfortunate for the poor child.

356
00:40:43,882 --> 00:40:47,082
Are you the king here?
You look like a king.

357
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,042
Ah, little fraulein, if only
the rest of the world...

358
00:40:51,122 --> 00:40:53,682
could see through your eyes.

359
00:40:53,802 --> 00:40:55,242
Hmm, quite a personage...

360
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:58,962
under that extraordinary hat.

361
00:41:00,322 --> 00:41:02,923
They are here, Fraulein.

362
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:07,123
- Andrews, what is she like?
- Highly intelligent.

363
00:41:07,243 --> 00:41:10,682
- Don't be misled by the hat.
- Show them in,

364
00:41:30,442 --> 00:41:32,842
How do you do, Fraulein Rottenmeier?

365
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:35,081
- What is your name?
- Heidi.

366
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,321
Heidi? Ridiculous.

367
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:39,922
What name did they give
you when you were baptized?

368
00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:42,122
I don't remember that.

369
00:41:42,242 --> 00:41:44,482
Are you being impudent?

370
00:41:44,562 --> 00:41:47,202
No, Fraulein. She didn't understand.

371
00:41:47,322 --> 00:41:50,481
- She was baptized Adelheid.
- Hmm.

372
00:41:50,602 --> 00:41:54,242
She looks too young. How old is she?

373
00:41:54,321 --> 00:41:57,882
She's older than she appears.
She's nearly 11.

374
00:41:57,962 --> 00:42:00,322
Aunt Dete doesn't tell the truth.

375
00:42:00,442 --> 00:42:04,682
I'm eight years old today.

376
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:06,962
Grandfather was going to
give me a birthday party.

377
00:42:07,082 --> 00:42:08,962
How far have you gone in school?

378
00:42:09,082 --> 00:42:11,042
I've never gone at all.

379
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:35,281
How do you do, Fraulein Klara?
I hope you will be well soon.

380
00:42:35,361 --> 00:42:39,281
Not fraulein. I'm just Klara,
and I'll call you Heidi.

381
00:42:39,361 --> 00:42:43,122
- Why do you sit in that chair with wheels?
- I can't walk.

382
00:42:43,242 --> 00:42:45,442
I fell last summer and hurt my back.

383
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:48,881
That's when Fraulein Rottenmeier
came to take care of me.

384
00:42:48,961 --> 00:42:52,881
Then you couldn't climb the mountain
with Goat Peter, Swanly and Bearly.

385
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:55,401
Who are they? Are they friends of yours?

386
00:42:55,521 --> 00:42:57,161
Yes. They're the grandfather's goats...

387
00:42:57,281 --> 00:43:00,081
and Peter, he's the goat general.

388
00:43:00,162 --> 00:43:02,562
Oh, tell me about them.

389
00:43:02,682 --> 00:43:05,881
That's enough! You will take
that impossible child back!

390
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:08,041
You'll have to give me
more expense money then...

391
00:43:08,161 --> 00:43:10,281
and the 50 marks Herr Sesemann promised.

392
00:43:10,361 --> 00:43:12,041
You dare to speak to me like that?

393
00:43:12,361 --> 00:43:15,641
- I'll not give you one pfennig!
- You'd better.

394
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:19,081
I've brought just the kind of child
Herr Sesemann asked for...

395
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:22,241
unless you have
your own reasons for not wanting her.

396
00:43:22,361 --> 00:43:25,041
Get out, and take your
wretched niece with you!

397
00:43:25,161 --> 00:43:27,001
All right, but you'll give me the money...

398
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:29,401
or I'll write to Herr Sesemann.

399
00:43:29,521 --> 00:43:32,720
You think I don't know
what your little game is?

400
00:43:32,841 --> 00:43:35,241
A rich widower and his sick child.

401
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:38,401
You don't want Klara
to get well... not yet...

402
00:43:38,521 --> 00:43:40,401
not until you've made him think...

403
00:43:40,521 --> 00:43:43,560
his little darling can't live without you.

404
00:43:43,681 --> 00:43:47,241
Now you can get rid of
the "impossible child" yourself!

405
00:43:47,361 --> 00:43:49,801
Sell her to the Gypsies, for all I care!

406
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,921
I'm afraid the grandfather will be worried.

407
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,360
He didn't know I was going away,
so I must go back tomorrow.

408
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,401
- Didn't Dete tell you?
- What?

409
00:43:57,521 --> 00:44:00,041
- That you're to live here with me,
- No, she didn't tell me.

410
00:44:00,161 --> 00:44:05,320
You see, my mama's dead, and my papa's
business keeps him in Paris most of the time.

411
00:44:05,441 --> 00:44:09,280
- And I haven't anyone to play with.
- I can't live here!

412
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,600
I'm going back to the
grandfather right away!

413
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,840
- Indeed, you are.
- No, I like her!

414
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,840
Andrews will take you home in the morning.

415
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,761
- No, I want her to stay!
- That is for me to decide.

416
00:44:18,841 --> 00:44:23,401
- I know what is best for you, Klara.
- No! No! Papa sent for her, and you've got to wait till he comes home!

417
00:44:23,521 --> 00:44:27,361
Klara, you're not strong enough for this
excitement. You'll make yourself ill.

418
00:44:27,481 --> 00:44:30,760
Yes, I will, I know I will
if you don't let me keep Heidi!

419
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,801
- But, Klara, I can't stay!
- Quiet, dear.

420
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:37,400
Quiet. Remember what
a sick little girl you are.

421
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,640
You do want me to get well,
don't you, Fraulein?

422
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,000
- How can you ask?
- Then-Then please let me keep Heidi.

423
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:50,360
- Very well. For the present.
- You can't keep me here!

424
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,601
The grandfather is waiting.
He doesn't know where I am!

425
00:44:53,721 --> 00:44:56,200
Dinner is served.

426
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,200
You'll like it here, Heidi.

427
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,760
We'll have such good times together.

428
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,441
And Fraulein can send word
to your grandfather.

429
00:45:06,561 --> 00:45:08,961
No, no! Aunt Dete must take me home!

430
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,160
Dinner is waiting.
We will attend to that tomorrow.

431
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,880
- Then it's all right? I can go?
- I said in the morning, Adelheid.

432
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,760
Adelheid...

433
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,840
I am waiting.

434
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,640
For what we are about to receive...

435
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,599
the Lord make us truly thankful.

436
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,400
God bless Grandfather
and Swanly and Bearly...

437
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,600
and please make me a good little girl.

438
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,280
- Amen.
- Ha!

439
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,000
You may serve.

440
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:20,320
Remember, Klara, only a little,

441
00:46:32,399 --> 00:46:37,039
- Must you hoard your food, Adelheid?
- It's for the grandmother.

442
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:39,399
I'm going to take it home with me tomorrow.

443
00:46:39,479 --> 00:46:41,559
Put it back.

444
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:48,960
- What's that?
- It's technically known as false hare.

445
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,599
I think you'll find it rather tasty.
Will you serve yourself?

446
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:56,119
I think I'd rather just have some cheese.

447
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,200
Evidently our little friend
has no idea of table manners.

448
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,400
Bring me the tray, Andrews.

449
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,400
Now watch, Adelheid.

450
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,759
This is the way
civilized people serve themselves,

451
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,799
Stop!

452
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:34,799
Oh, dear, what a pity.

453
00:47:38,919 --> 00:47:40,479
You may go.

454
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,719
This is not humorous.

455
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:49,959
You are not in your barbarous hut
in the Alps now, but in a cultured home.

456
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:53,319
Adelheid, !

457
00:47:53,439 --> 00:47:56,559
Did I actually see you yawn?

458
00:47:56,679 --> 00:48:00,479
- I'm horrified!
- Don't scold her.

459
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:03,079
She's had such a hard day.

460
00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:07,599
I am trying to be patient, Klara.

461
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:11,759
But it is the height of impropriety
to yawn at the dinner table.

462
00:48:11,879 --> 00:48:14,799
Ayawn at any time
is a sign of disrespect...

463
00:48:14,879 --> 00:48:16,919
and lack of control,

464
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:19,718
It shows the attention is wandering...

465
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:23,439
and that the young person is not
interested in the improvement of her mind.

466
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:25,798
Oh!

467
00:48:45,198 --> 00:48:48,078
Why, it's really more than it's worth.

468
00:48:56,678 --> 00:48:59,439
- You're going for the child?
- I am.

469
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:01,859
You're not walking all the way
to Frankfurt? It's over 100 miles.

470
00:49:01,879 --> 00:49:05,518
- I shall get there.
- Let us lend you enough railway fare.

471
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:07,518
That's kind of you, Franz...

472
00:49:07,638 --> 00:49:09,518
but my legs will carry me.

473
00:49:09,638 --> 00:49:12,519
I have money to bring us back on the train.

474
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:15,878
Auf Wiedersehen. - Good luck,
Adolph. - Godspeed to you, neighbor.

475
00:49:48,918 --> 00:49:51,358
Well, Little Miss Hasty Pudding.

476
00:49:51,478 --> 00:49:54,078
I heard Goat Peter's horn.
He must be looking for me.

477
00:49:54,198 --> 00:49:57,038
- Goat Peter?
- Yes. There. Don't you hear it?

478
00:49:57,118 --> 00:50:00,878
I say, it's a little chilly outside
for this sort of thing, isn't it?

479
00:50:00,958 --> 00:50:03,518
Let's try the window. Come on.

480
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:18,317
Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

481
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:25,643
Oh, it isn't Goat Peter at all.
It's only fresh fish.

482
00:50:25,763 --> 00:50:27,645
You'd better get dressed, little fraulein.

483
00:50:27,765 --> 00:50:29,727
Breakfast will be soon.

484
00:50:31,089 --> 00:50:35,173
Well, I never thought I'd
turn out to be a lady's maid.

485
00:50:37,014 --> 00:50:40,617
There. Hurry up.

486
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:46,103
Breakfast in 10 minutes, Adelheid.

487
00:50:46,223 --> 00:50:48,385
We insist on punctuality in this household.

488
00:50:48,465 --> 00:50:51,268
"Punctuality."

489
00:50:52,268 --> 00:50:54,390
Don't dawdle.

490
00:51:09,204 --> 00:51:11,086
"Adelheid-"

491
00:51:11,206 --> 00:51:13,808
Well, I... Shh!

492
00:51:17,052 --> 00:51:22,617
It is the height of punctuality
to yawn at the dinner table.

493
00:51:22,737 --> 00:51:25,420
Isn't Heidi the funniest little thing?

494
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,582
I'm so glad she's going to stay.

495
00:51:27,702 --> 00:51:29,944
- Is she?
- Yes, but she doesn't know it.

496
00:51:30,064 --> 00:51:32,786
The poor dear thinks
she's going home today.

497
00:51:32,906 --> 00:51:35,629
But she'll be happier here.
Don't you think so?

498
00:51:35,709 --> 00:51:37,631
I'll have some new dresses made for her.

499
00:51:37,711 --> 00:51:40,634
Do you think you could manage a new hat?

500
00:51:43,557 --> 00:51:46,039
Oh, Heidi!

501
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:48,801
It's lovely!

502
00:51:48,921 --> 00:51:52,325
I wonder where Aunt Dete is.
It's time we started.

503
00:51:52,405 --> 00:51:54,807
Oh, uh, don't think about that now.

504
00:51:54,927 --> 00:51:58,331
We're going to have our lessons
with Fraulein in a minute.

505
00:51:58,411 --> 00:52:01,333
Well, maybe I could just this once...

506
00:52:01,413 --> 00:52:03,415
if there's time.

507
00:52:03,535 --> 00:52:05,417
I'll be sorry to leave you.

508
00:52:05,537 --> 00:52:07,419
I hope you begin to walk soon...

509
00:52:07,539 --> 00:52:09,941
and not have to sit in that chair.

510
00:52:10,021 --> 00:52:12,944
Fraulein says perhaps
I'll never walk again.

511
00:52:13,025 --> 00:52:15,947
Well, Goat Peter said
I'd never learn to read...

512
00:52:16,027 --> 00:52:19,631
but the grandfather
told me I could, and I did.

513
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:26,117
Your back feels just like mine.

514
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:29,960
And your legs do too.

515
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,283
I should think you could walk
if you wanted to enough.

516
00:52:33,363 --> 00:52:35,765
- Why don't you try?
- Oh, I wouldn't dare.

517
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:38,288
- Why not?
- I might fall.

518
00:52:38,368 --> 00:52:40,930
Lean on me. I'm pretty strong.

519
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:43,453
Do you really think I could walk?

520
00:52:43,573 --> 00:52:45,975
We'll try, then we'd find out.

521
00:52:46,055 --> 00:52:48,297
Come on, put your hand on me.

522
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,942
No, no, I can't!

523
00:52:53,062 --> 00:52:55,464
- Don't ever tell Fraulein!
- I won't.

524
00:53:03,272 --> 00:53:05,594
- What's that?
- A monkey.

525
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,442
I'd better let her in.
She's sitting in the snow.

526
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:16,404
Oh, Fraulein wouldn't like it.

527
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,566
She wouldn't want her to catch cold.

528
00:53:18,686 --> 00:53:21,288
Besides, I've never met a monkey. Have you?

529
00:53:21,408 --> 00:53:23,370
No. Not to speak to.

530
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,216
Oh, she says she's very cold.

531
00:53:30,857 --> 00:53:34,420
Come on! Come on!

532
00:53:42,388 --> 00:53:44,630
How are you?

533
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:46,952
She has very nice manners.

534
00:53:47,073 --> 00:53:50,835
Fraulein Rottenmeier
would like you. Come on.

535
00:53:55,401 --> 00:53:58,763
Doorbell when the hall's being washed down!

536
00:53:58,883 --> 00:54:02,167
- I want-a Louise.
- You want what?

537
00:54:02,287 --> 00:54:05,689
- Louise, a-my monkey.
- Monkey? You've been misinformed.

538
00:54:05,769 --> 00:54:08,172
This is not the zoo!

539
00:54:41,484 --> 00:54:44,366
You'd make a very nice schoolteacher.

540
00:54:55,576 --> 00:54:59,020
She wants you to name
the principal rivers of Europe.

541
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:03,024
I'm afraid that's too hard.
Can't you ask me something easier?

542
00:55:11,592 --> 00:55:15,355
If you young ladies have finished with
you vulgar display of lack of restraint...

543
00:55:15,475 --> 00:55:17,557
we will begin our lessons.

544
00:55:23,202 --> 00:55:26,045
Andrews! Andrews! Help! Help!

545
00:55:26,165 --> 00:55:28,807
Did you call?

546
00:55:28,928 --> 00:55:31,330
Take that thing out of here!

547
00:55:34,213 --> 00:55:37,255
My word. A gorilla!

548
00:55:39,457 --> 00:55:41,659
Well, don't stand there fiddle-faddy.

549
00:55:41,779 --> 00:55:43,661
Take that beast out of here!

550
00:55:43,781 --> 00:55:46,425
This is no laughing matter!

551
00:55:46,545 --> 00:55:48,507
Yes, uh, scat, ! Do you mind? Scat, !

552
00:55:48,627 --> 00:55:50,147
Aah!

553
00:55:51,269 --> 00:55:55,193
Get him off! Get him off!

554
00:55:55,273 --> 00:55:57,715
Oh, oh, oh!

555
00:56:09,806 --> 00:56:12,889
- Oh, I'm most awfully sorry. This is most undignified.
- How dare you!

556
00:56:13,009 --> 00:56:17,133
This is really not my fault.
Can I help you up at all? There we go!

557
00:56:17,253 --> 00:56:20,216
Well!

558
00:56:22,738 --> 00:56:26,061
Get him out of here, !

559
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,304
Oh, my God!

560
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:37,272
You might try putting salt on her tail.

561
00:56:37,392 --> 00:56:40,394
- Ah, what we need is strategy.
- Can I get it for you?

562
00:56:40,514 --> 00:56:42,998
No, thank you. I think I've got it.

563
00:56:43,118 --> 00:56:44,999
Now the rest of you draw fire.

564
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,282
I'll attack from the rear.

565
00:56:51,285 --> 00:56:53,086
Come here, little monkey!

566
00:56:53,166 --> 00:56:55,649
Come here, ! come, ! come, !

567
00:56:55,729 --> 00:56:59,452
- Come on! Come on!
- Here, monkey!

568
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:08,461
This has gone far enough!

569
00:57:11,264 --> 00:57:14,026
Come on in.

570
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,633
Louise! Louise!

571
00:57:20,753 --> 00:57:23,715
- She'll come down now. Here's your papa.
- Come, Louise.

572
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:29,641
Better get out quickly
before she finds her tongue.

573
00:57:29,761 --> 00:57:34,805
- Here you are.
- What's the matter with you?

574
00:57:41,251 --> 00:57:43,173
- Who let that beast in?
- I did.

575
00:57:43,253 --> 00:57:46,177
- But she was so cold out in the snow.
- That's no concern of ours.

576
00:57:46,257 --> 00:57:48,819
Please, Fraulein, it was
my fault as much as hers.

577
00:57:48,939 --> 00:57:52,342
Such conduct is inexcusable!
She shall be punished severely!

578
00:57:52,422 --> 00:57:54,344
Don't you touch her! I'll write Papa!

579
00:57:54,424 --> 00:57:57,187
Oh, I'm sorry, dear. Don't excite yourself.

580
00:57:57,267 --> 00:57:59,189
I'd forgotten it might upset you.

581
00:57:59,269 --> 00:58:02,512
Adelheid, you shall spend
the rest of the day in your room.

582
00:58:02,592 --> 00:58:05,314
I can't do that.
Aunt Dete is going to take me home.

583
00:58:05,394 --> 00:58:07,396
Your aunt went away this morning.

584
00:58:07,476 --> 00:58:10,279
She... went away?

585
00:58:10,399 --> 00:58:12,321
But she's coming back.

586
00:58:12,441 --> 00:58:16,885
- No, she's not. I discharged her.
- But she's got to take me home!

587
00:58:17,005 --> 00:58:19,768
I'm afraid not.
She cares nothing about you.

588
00:58:19,848 --> 00:58:23,452
- She told me to sell you to the Gypsies.
- Oh, Fraulein, don't.

589
00:58:23,572 --> 00:58:27,455
I doubt whether you will
ever see your Aunt Dete again.

590
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:03,008
- What does this mean?
- You mustn't stop me!

591
00:59:03,088 --> 00:59:06,091
What have you got in that hat?

592
00:59:06,211 --> 00:59:09,975
- Oh. So you were running away.
- I wasn't running away.

593
00:59:10,095 --> 00:59:12,097
I was just going home by myself.

594
00:59:12,217 --> 00:59:16,661
- Andrews, throw these rolls in the dustbin.
- Oh, no.

595
00:59:16,741 --> 00:59:19,463
They're for the grandmother.
She can't eat her black bread.

596
00:59:19,543 --> 00:59:21,625
Throw that wretched hat in the dustbin too.

597
00:59:21,705 --> 00:59:24,949
Oh, no. Not my hat. I need that to go home.

598
00:59:25,069 --> 00:59:27,471
That is all, Andrews.

599
00:59:29,673 --> 00:59:33,117
If you stop me, I'll run away again!
I can't stay here!

600
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:35,119
There aren't any pine trees
or any mountains!

601
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:37,601
The grandfather doesn't know where I am!

602
00:59:37,721 --> 00:59:39,803
- You've got to let me go!
- Stop this nonsense!

603
00:59:39,923 --> 00:59:41,965
You're not going home until I send you!

604
00:59:42,085 --> 00:59:44,167
Now you march upstairs!

605
00:59:46,529 --> 00:59:50,092
You leave your room again
today, you'll be whipped!

606
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:11,993
Come on, little fraulein. Keep the chin up.

607
01:00:12,113 --> 01:00:14,876
Here's your precious bonnet.

608
01:00:17,038 --> 01:00:19,800
Don't you think we ought to put it
under the bed to avoid the dustbin?

609
01:00:22,602 --> 01:00:24,684
Try and cheer her up, dear, will you?

610
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:28,368
Oh, Heidi, I-

611
01:00:28,448 --> 01:00:31,251
I didn't know you wanted
to go home so much.

612
01:00:31,371 --> 01:00:33,333
But you mustn't run away again.

613
01:00:33,413 --> 01:00:36,696
- Promise you won't.
- Oh, no. I couldn't promise.

614
01:00:36,816 --> 01:00:38,778
You must, Heidi.

615
01:00:38,858 --> 01:00:41,020
Papa's coming home for Christmas.

616
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:43,022
That's only two weeks more.

617
01:00:43,142 --> 01:00:46,185
If-If you still feel homesick then...

618
01:00:46,305 --> 01:00:48,867
I'll ask him to send you back.

619
01:00:48,988 --> 01:00:52,231
Are you sure he will?

620
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:54,833
Oh, yes. He'll do it for me.

621
01:00:56,435 --> 01:00:58,397
I won't run away.

622
01:00:58,477 --> 01:01:00,959
I promise.

623
01:01:08,445 --> 01:01:10,849
Come in.

624
01:01:15,293 --> 01:01:17,375
I'm all new to meet Klara's papa.

625
01:01:17,455 --> 01:01:19,537
And, I must say, very impressive.

626
01:01:19,657 --> 01:01:20,857
And just look at this!

627
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:23,019
I was hoping for a new hat.

628
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:25,021
But I'm not going to wear my new clothes...

629
01:01:25,101 --> 01:01:27,023
- when I go home tonight.
- No?

630
01:01:27,103 --> 01:01:29,025
The grandfather might not know me.

631
01:01:29,105 --> 01:01:30,867
You're going to leave us tonight, are you?

632
01:01:30,947 --> 01:01:33,269
Yes. Klara's gonna ask her papa to send me.

633
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:36,873
He'll be here in a few moments, and I've
come to tell you that when you meet him...

634
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:39,395
you're to say, "How do
you do, gracious sir?"

635
01:01:39,475 --> 01:01:42,077
- And make him a little curtsy.
- What's that?

636
01:01:42,197 --> 01:01:45,881
Well, it's uh-

637
01:01:48,003 --> 01:01:49,644
That's a funny way to say how do you do.

638
01:01:49,724 --> 01:01:52,167
I daresay, but don't you think
you ought to practice it?

639
01:01:54,008 --> 01:01:56,731
How do you do, gracious sir?

640
01:01:56,852 --> 01:01:58,893
Yes, I think that ought to do.

641
01:02:13,948 --> 01:02:15,869
A merry Christmas to you, sir.

642
01:02:15,949 --> 01:02:17,971
- Merry Christmas to you, Andrews.
- Thank you, sir.

643
01:02:17,991 --> 01:02:20,354
- Everything all right?
- Oh, yes, sir. Quite all right.

644
01:02:20,474 --> 01:02:22,435
Quite all right.

645
01:02:23,556 --> 01:02:28,000
- Merry Christmas, Karl.
- Merry Christmas to you, sir.

646
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,202
Welcome, Herr Sesemann.

647
01:02:30,322 --> 01:02:32,364
Oh, thank you, Fraulein Rottenmeier.

648
01:02:32,485 --> 01:02:35,207
- How is Klara?
- As well as may be expected...

649
01:02:35,327 --> 01:02:37,249
considering what we've been through.

650
01:02:37,369 --> 01:02:39,491
I didn't want to disturb you by writing...

651
01:02:39,571 --> 01:02:42,734
- but the child Dete brought is impossible.
- Indeed!

652
01:02:42,814 --> 01:02:47,739
Her manners are dreadful, and she excites
Klara to do things beyond her strength.

653
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:49,941
I've been seriously worried.

654
01:02:50,021 --> 01:02:53,625
I'm sorry to hear that.
Why didn't you send the girl away?

655
01:02:53,745 --> 01:02:56,627
Klara took an absurd fancy to the child...

656
01:02:56,747 --> 01:02:58,709
and I hadn't the heart to cross her.

657
01:02:58,789 --> 01:03:02,153
You know I'm foolishly fond of dear Klara.

658
01:03:02,233 --> 01:03:05,195
But I hope you'll act immediately
for the sake of Klara's health.

659
01:03:05,315 --> 01:03:08,839
- Papa, Papa, I'm waiting, !
- Coming, dear.

660
01:03:08,959 --> 01:03:11,361
We will discuss this later, Fraulein.

661
01:03:12,803 --> 01:03:16,726
- Oh, Papa, I'm so glad to see you.
- Oh, darling.

662
01:03:18,648 --> 01:03:22,692
Klara, what has happened? I expected-

663
01:03:22,812 --> 01:03:24,974
That is, Fraulein told me-

664
01:03:25,054 --> 01:03:27,857
But you haven't looked so well
since your accident.

665
01:03:27,977 --> 01:03:30,579
Of course. Because I've been so happy.

666
01:03:30,659 --> 01:03:34,903
- It's Heidi. My little companion.
- Heidi?

667
01:03:35,023 --> 01:03:38,146
Thank you a thousand times
for letting me have her.

668
01:03:38,266 --> 01:03:42,190
But Fraulein seems to think
she excites you beyond your strength.

669
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:47,034
I like to be excited, and she makes
something funny happen all the time.

670
01:03:47,154 --> 01:03:50,478
Oh, Papa, she's the dearest little thing.

671
01:03:50,598 --> 01:03:54,602
Well, my darling, something
has had an amazing effect on you.

672
01:03:54,682 --> 01:03:58,244
I didn't have much
to look forward to before.

673
01:03:58,326 --> 01:04:00,728
Now when I wake up, I think...

674
01:04:00,848 --> 01:04:04,050
"I'm going to spend the day with Heidi!"

675
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:07,534
I don't see why Fraulein doesn't like her.

676
01:04:07,654 --> 01:04:10,656
Nor I. It's very odd.

677
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:17,343
This, sir, is Fraulein Heidi.

678
01:04:19,305 --> 01:04:21,507
How do you do, Heidi?

679
01:04:21,627 --> 01:04:23,669
How do you do, Sir Gracious?

680
01:04:27,593 --> 01:04:32,197
I didn't do it very well.
Shall I try it again?

681
01:04:32,317 --> 01:04:35,360
I don't think that could be improved upon.

682
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,882
We're going in to the
Christmas tree in a minute.

683
01:04:37,962 --> 01:04:40,885
You'll never guess
what your present is, will he, Heidi?

684
01:04:40,965 --> 01:04:43,887
Let me see. Is it animal,
vegetable or mineral?

685
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:46,731
Well, I suppose it's sort of animal.

686
01:04:46,811 --> 01:04:50,213
I know. It's a Shetland pony.

687
01:04:57,501 --> 01:05:00,743
We're ready for the
ceremony, Herr Sesemann.

688
01:05:00,823 --> 01:05:03,025
Come on, Sir Gracious!

689
01:05:07,109 --> 01:05:08,991
Here we go.

690
01:05:09,111 --> 01:05:11,834
Remember, don't excite yourself.
You'll tire easily.

691
01:05:11,954 --> 01:05:13,916
Yes, Fraulein.

692
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:32,213
Silent night

693
01:05:32,333 --> 01:05:35,056
Holy night

694
01:05:35,176 --> 01:05:37,738
All is calm

695
01:05:37,818 --> 01:05:40,460
All is bright

696
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:45,906
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child

697
01:05:46,026 --> 01:05:51,471
Holy Infant, so tender and mild

698
01:05:51,592 --> 01:05:57,116
Sleep in heavenly peace

699
01:05:57,236 --> 01:06:02,642
Sleep in heavenly peace

700
01:06:02,722 --> 01:06:05,364
Silent night

701
01:06:05,444 --> 01:06:08,207
Holy night

702
01:06:08,287 --> 01:06:10,929
All is calm

703
01:06:11,049 --> 01:06:13,572
All is bright

704
01:06:13,652 --> 01:06:18,937
Round yon virgin Mother and child

705
01:06:19,057 --> 01:06:24,422
Holy Infant, so tender and mild

706
01:06:24,502 --> 01:06:32,502
Sleep in heavenly peace

707
01:06:35,913 --> 01:06:38,675
Silent night

708
01:06:38,755 --> 01:06:41,317
Holy night

709
01:06:41,437 --> 01:06:44,041
All is calm

710
01:06:44,161 --> 01:06:46,883
All is bright

711
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:52,368
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child

712
01:06:52,489 --> 01:06:57,733
Holy Infant so tender and mild

713
01:06:57,853 --> 01:07:03,419
Sleep in heavenly peace

714
01:07:03,539 --> 01:07:08,623
Sleep in heavenly peace

715
01:07:08,743 --> 01:07:11,306
Lovely, Heidi! Lovely.

716
01:07:16,911 --> 01:07:19,354
Merry Christmas to you all...

717
01:07:19,434 --> 01:07:21,476
and thank you for another
year's faithful service.

718
01:07:21,556 --> 01:07:23,838
Our Christmas greetings to you,
sir, and Fraulein Klara.

719
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:26,320
A long life and good health to you both.

720
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,483
- Thank you, Andrews.
- We're very grateful, sir.

721
01:07:29,563 --> 01:07:31,645
- Karl.
- Thank you, sir.

722
01:07:31,765 --> 01:07:33,807
- Fritz.
- Thank you very much, sir.

723
01:07:33,928 --> 01:07:36,490
- Merry Christmas, Frieda.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

724
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:39,492
We'll wait till we've had our presents.

725
01:07:39,572 --> 01:07:43,296
He thinks it's going to be an animal.

726
01:07:43,376 --> 01:07:46,900
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you, sir.

727
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,021
For your Christmas,
Fraulein. And thank you...

728
01:07:49,142 --> 01:07:51,824
for the efficient management
of my household.

729
01:07:51,944 --> 01:07:55,347
Thank you, Herr Sesemann.
I've always felt like a mother to Klara.

730
01:07:55,427 --> 01:07:58,150
Now, Papa, my present to Heidi first.

731
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:01,673
- Oh, Klara. Your back.
- Oh.

732
01:08:01,793 --> 01:08:03,835
I forgot.

733
01:08:03,955 --> 01:08:05,957
That one, Papa.

734
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:13,845
- Happy Christmas to you, my dear.
- Thank you.

735
01:08:21,451 --> 01:08:25,295
To Klara, from her doting papa.

736
01:08:31,261 --> 01:08:34,423
Turn it upside down,
then right-side up, Heidi.

737
01:08:42,591 --> 01:08:45,194
It's the grandfather's house!

738
01:08:45,274 --> 01:08:48,637
He's bringing in the wood.

739
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:50,719
Can I keep it for always?

740
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:52,801
Longer than that.

741
01:08:52,881 --> 01:08:56,004
Oh! Heidi, look!

742
01:08:57,606 --> 01:09:00,848
- Oh!
- It's lovely.

743
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:03,331
Now it's my turn. I don't see...

744
01:09:03,451 --> 01:09:05,613
my Shetland pony around anywhere.

745
01:09:05,693 --> 01:09:08,096
Shall we give him his present now?

746
01:09:08,216 --> 01:09:10,458
You hold my doll, Fraulein.

747
01:09:14,221 --> 01:09:17,264
Now watch, Papa. You stand over there.

748
01:09:26,472 --> 01:09:29,596
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not.

749
01:09:33,118 --> 01:09:35,040
- Klara, stop!
- Wait!

750
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:44,970
Lean on me until you get started.

751
01:09:51,936 --> 01:09:53,498
Now, try hard.

752
01:10:11,955 --> 01:10:14,998
Merry Christmas, Papa.

753
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:17,120
Oh, my darling.

754
01:10:17,201 --> 01:10:19,523
My darling child.

755
01:10:44,546 --> 01:10:47,188
They told me you might never walk again.

756
01:10:47,308 --> 01:10:50,872
- How did you? How did it happen?
- Heidi taught me.

757
01:10:50,992 --> 01:10:53,314
Heidi-

758
01:10:55,636 --> 01:10:58,198
I was afraid, but she made me try.

759
01:10:58,318 --> 01:11:00,400
We did a little more every day.

760
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,404
You dear child, you've worked a miracle.

761
01:11:03,484 --> 01:11:05,486
Oh, no. It was the grandfather.

762
01:11:05,606 --> 01:11:08,008
Goat Peter said I'd never learn to read...

763
01:11:08,088 --> 01:11:10,050
but the grandfather said
I could if I wanted to...

764
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:12,212
and I did.

765
01:11:12,332 --> 01:11:14,494
So I thought Klara
could walk if she wanted to...

766
01:11:14,614 --> 01:11:16,496
and she did.

767
01:11:16,616 --> 01:11:19,818
You've given me the happiest
Christmas of my life.

768
01:11:19,938 --> 01:11:23,502
And I've had a nice Christmas present too.

769
01:11:23,622 --> 01:11:25,504
Shall I get ready to go home now?

770
01:11:25,624 --> 01:11:28,026
No. I have another
Christmas present for you-

771
01:11:28,106 --> 01:11:30,268
a home with us as long as you live.

772
01:11:30,388 --> 01:11:33,512
- No. I couldn't do that.
- Why not?

773
01:11:33,632 --> 01:11:35,594
The grandfather's been waiting for me...

774
01:11:35,674 --> 01:11:37,636
such a long time.

775
01:11:37,716 --> 01:11:41,519
Oh, Heidi, I hoped
you wouldn't want to go now.

776
01:11:45,002 --> 01:11:47,084
Yes, I'd like to be that...

777
01:11:47,205 --> 01:11:50,007
but I've got to go home.

778
01:11:50,127 --> 01:11:54,371
Papa, I told Heidi you'd
let her go if she wanted to.

779
01:11:54,491 --> 01:11:57,895
But you don't understand, dear.
You'll be my own daughter.

780
01:11:57,975 --> 01:12:00,697
You'll have clothes like Klara's...

781
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,899
everything just like hers...

782
01:12:03,019 --> 01:12:04,901
and grow up to be a great lady.

783
01:12:05,021 --> 01:12:07,823
- Now, wouldn't you like that?
- No, thank you.

784
01:12:07,943 --> 01:12:10,145
I want to go home to my grandfather.

785
01:12:10,267 --> 01:12:13,749
- I can't let you do that.
- But Klara promised!

786
01:12:13,869 --> 01:12:18,513
- I... I'm sorry, Heidi.
Someday you'll understand.

787
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,323
Papa, I did promise you'd send her home.

788
01:12:29,764 --> 01:12:32,647
But dear, you don't know
what her grandfather's like.

789
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:34,969
Dete told me that he was
a very brutal man...

790
01:12:35,089 --> 01:12:36,971
feared by everyone.

791
01:12:37,091 --> 01:12:40,895
No, Heidi will be
much happier here with us.

792
01:12:45,499 --> 01:12:48,742
You! You've spoiled everything!

793
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:50,904
Don't break my snowstorm!

794
01:12:54,508 --> 01:12:56,550
Fraulein Rottenmeier, !

795
01:12:58,191 --> 01:13:00,112
What is the meaning of this?

796
01:13:00,192 --> 01:13:02,756
Forgive me, Herr Sesemann,
I-I was beyond myself.

797
01:13:02,876 --> 01:13:06,799
You must realize I cannot
have you longer in my employ.

798
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,362
- Yes, Herr Sesemann.
- I'll give you a month's salary.

799
01:13:09,442 --> 01:13:12,284
You will arrange to leave tomorrow.

800
01:13:23,014 --> 01:13:25,577
Grandfather.

801
01:13:25,697 --> 01:13:28,419
Grandfather.

802
01:13:29,821 --> 01:13:32,143
I'll never see you again.

803
01:14:05,093 --> 01:14:08,777
- Looking for somebody?
- My granddaughter.

804
01:14:08,897 --> 01:14:10,939
You might find her at the theater.

805
01:14:11,059 --> 01:14:14,783
Every youngster in town tries
to get there on Christmas day.

806
01:14:14,903 --> 01:14:18,146
Yes. She might be there. Thank you.

807
01:14:24,312 --> 01:14:27,795
- What is it, Grandpa?
- I'm looking for my granddaughter.

808
01:14:27,915 --> 01:14:31,638
- But you can't go inside.
- I must see if she's here.

809
01:14:31,718 --> 01:14:33,640
Sorry, sir. The performance is just over.

810
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:35,642
You better wait over there.

811
01:14:35,722 --> 01:14:37,964
All right.

812
01:14:52,138 --> 01:14:56,982
Santa Claus!

813
01:14:57,102 --> 01:15:02,027
- Santa Claus!
- Santa Claus!

814
01:15:10,154 --> 01:15:13,117
Santa Claus!

815
01:15:13,198 --> 01:15:16,120
Oh, Heidi, see the funny
Santa Claus over there?

816
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,441
Where? I can't see.

817
01:15:17,562 --> 01:15:19,443
Papa, please take us over to see him.

818
01:15:19,563 --> 01:15:22,366
We better not, dear. You've had
too much excitement for one day.

819
01:15:22,446 --> 01:15:27,691
- But Heidi hasn't seen him.
- Never mind. I don't care.

820
01:15:29,813 --> 01:15:32,976
Heidi! Heidi, where are you?

821
01:15:33,056 --> 01:15:35,298
It's the grandfather calling me!

822
01:15:35,419 --> 01:15:37,781
It couldn't be your grandfather, Heidi.

823
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:40,343
It sounded just like him.

824
01:15:42,825 --> 01:15:45,989
You must be mistaken, dear. Your grandfather
is 100 miles away on his mountain.

825
01:15:46,069 --> 01:15:49,791
I'm almost sure I heard him.
I know it was his voice!

826
01:15:49,911 --> 01:15:53,955
Grandfather! Grandfather! Where are you?

827
01:15:54,035 --> 01:15:56,999
Heidi! Heidi!

828
01:16:03,445 --> 01:16:05,567
Whoa!

829
01:16:17,097 --> 01:16:19,820
Don't you worry.
That wasn't your grandfather.

830
01:16:26,706 --> 01:16:29,429
Heidi! Heidi!

831
01:16:33,793 --> 01:16:36,196
- Heidi!
- What do you want?

832
01:16:36,276 --> 01:16:38,278
I thought this was the sleigh.

833
01:16:38,398 --> 01:16:40,360
It must be the right street.

834
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,442
Heidi!

835
01:16:42,522 --> 01:16:44,483
Schutzmann,

836
01:16:44,604 --> 01:16:47,844
That old fellow is acting very strangely.
I think you'd better keep an eye on him.

837
01:16:54,292 --> 01:16:57,816
Is my granddaughter here?
A child named Heidi.

838
01:16:57,896 --> 01:17:01,779
Your granddaughter? It isn't likely.

839
01:17:01,899 --> 01:17:03,781
I'll see for myself!

840
01:17:03,901 --> 01:17:06,063
Come here! What are you doing here?

841
01:17:06,183 --> 01:17:09,747
I'm looking for my granddaughter.
She may be in this house!

842
01:17:11,709 --> 01:17:14,111
- Come! Come!
- You better come with us.

843
01:17:14,191 --> 01:17:17,754
She's in one of these houses.
I'll not leave till I find her!

844
01:17:17,874 --> 01:17:22,119
- What is this?
- You can't disturb people!

845
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:26,763
Herr Wachtmeister,
I heard her cry out from the sleigh.

846
01:17:26,883 --> 01:17:28,765
I tell you, she's in some trouble.

847
01:17:28,885 --> 01:17:32,889
We can't have you beating on
all the doors of Frankfurt at this hour!

848
01:17:33,009 --> 01:17:36,611
- I must find her.
- Of course. Of course.

849
01:17:36,731 --> 01:17:38,934
But she can come to no harm tonight.

850
01:17:39,055 --> 01:17:42,857
If you're still worried in the morning,
we'll investigate your story.

851
01:17:42,977 --> 01:17:45,500
I tell you, I must find her tonight!

852
01:17:46,581 --> 01:17:50,665
- Lock him up.
- The cells are full, Herr Wachtmeister.

853
01:17:50,785 --> 01:17:53,628
Naturally, naturally. Christmas night.

854
01:17:53,748 --> 01:17:56,471
- Put him in the detention room then.
- But, Herr Wachtmeister-

855
01:17:56,591 --> 01:17:58,673
Take him away.

856
01:18:08,001 --> 01:18:10,524
Stop that.

857
01:18:10,604 --> 01:18:12,766
Christmas comes but once a year

858
01:18:12,846 --> 01:18:15,088
Ja, and with it comes too much beer.

859
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:19,932
Christmas comes but once a year

860
01:18:20,012 --> 01:18:22,615
With it comes too much beer

861
01:18:53,884 --> 01:18:57,287
Heidi. Get up.

862
01:18:57,408 --> 01:18:59,570
And be very quiet.

863
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:02,292
Why? What's the matter?

864
01:19:02,412 --> 01:19:04,815
We're going away.

865
01:19:04,895 --> 01:19:07,897
Oh, is it morning already,
and you're going to take me home?

866
01:19:08,017 --> 01:19:10,420
Yes, that's it. We're going home.

867
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,581
But I thought Andrews was going to take me.

868
01:19:12,702 --> 01:19:16,986
Shh. He can't. You're to go
with me. Now dress quickly.

869
01:19:24,353 --> 01:19:28,157
If You are a just and merciful God...

870
01:19:28,277 --> 01:19:30,439
then help me...

871
01:19:30,519 --> 01:19:33,281
in this hour in my need.

872
01:19:34,643 --> 01:19:36,444
Hurry up!

873
01:19:36,524 --> 01:19:39,767
But first I must go and say good-bye
to Klara and her papa.

874
01:19:39,887 --> 01:19:43,451
No, you can't disturb them so early.
I said good-bye for you.

875
01:19:43,531 --> 01:19:45,533
Oh, wait. I forgot.

876
01:19:47,535 --> 01:19:49,697
Don't do that again!

877
01:20:02,949 --> 01:20:06,152
Heidi! Heidi!

878
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:28,533
I'll put a stop to that.

879
01:20:28,613 --> 01:20:31,016
Ah, let the poor chap enjoy his Christmas.

880
01:20:33,818 --> 01:20:36,180
Why, it isn't morning at all.

881
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:39,023
- It's still night.
- Shh! It's a long way.

882
01:20:39,143 --> 01:20:41,065
You've got to catch an early train.

883
01:20:54,837 --> 01:20:57,600
- This isn't the right way!
- I know what I'm doing!

884
01:20:57,721 --> 01:20:59,883
I don't think I'll go with you.
I'll wait for Andrews.

885
01:21:00,003 --> 01:21:02,045
He will have to find you first.

886
01:21:09,491 --> 01:21:11,653
Let me go! Let me go!

887
01:21:28,789 --> 01:21:32,673
- This is the child.
- Ah.

888
01:21:32,793 --> 01:21:34,835
Nice little girl.

889
01:21:36,477 --> 01:21:38,679
Let me go! I want my grandfather!

890
01:21:38,799 --> 01:21:41,161
- You'll never see your grandfather again.
- Come on!

891
01:21:41,281 --> 01:21:43,884
Come on. Ayyy!

892
01:21:45,485 --> 01:21:50,090
- Heidi! Heidi!
- Grandfather, ! Grandfather, !

893
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:52,932
Grandfather! Grandfather!

894
01:21:53,052 --> 01:21:55,574
- Heidi!
- Grandfather, !

895
01:21:55,694 --> 01:21:56,896
Grandfather, she's hurting me!

896
01:21:59,738 --> 01:22:01,740
Grandfather, take me home!

897
01:22:06,544 --> 01:22:08,506
What happened? What's the matter?

898
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:13,552
That old man stole my child.

899
01:22:13,672 --> 01:22:15,112
Hey, you! Stop!

900
01:22:17,395 --> 01:22:18,395
Stop!

901
01:22:26,604 --> 01:22:29,726
- They've stolen my sled.
- Who owns this one?

902
01:22:29,847 --> 01:22:31,848
- I do.
- Get in, and follow that man.

903
01:22:31,969 --> 01:22:33,850
- What happened?
- Stolen sleigh!

904
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:35,492
Follow that man with the child!

905
01:23:50,962 --> 01:23:52,604
Stop!

906
01:23:55,286 --> 01:23:56,928
Stop, or I'll shoot!

907
01:23:58,130 --> 01:23:59,410
Whoa!

908
01:24:00,812 --> 01:24:02,374
You broke out of jail.

909
01:24:02,494 --> 01:24:05,016
You took a sled that did not belong to you.

910
01:24:05,136 --> 01:24:06,056
You stole that child, !

911
01:24:06,137 --> 01:24:08,740
- He didn't steal me!
- I tell you, she's mine!

912
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:10,621
Silence!

913
01:24:10,701 --> 01:24:12,463
Herr Captain, we have found the woman.

914
01:24:12,583 --> 01:24:14,985
Good. Bring her in.

915
01:24:15,105 --> 01:24:17,468
- Is this your child?
- Yes, Herr Captain.

916
01:24:17,548 --> 01:24:18,869
No, I'm not!

917
01:24:18,989 --> 01:24:21,872
Is this the man who struck you
and took her away from you?

918
01:24:21,952 --> 01:24:24,314
- Yes.
- She's lying!

919
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:28,237
I don't know who she is or what
she's doing, but Heidi is mine!

920
01:24:28,318 --> 01:24:30,840
That's enough! You will be held for trial.

921
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:32,762
You stupid fools!

922
01:24:32,882 --> 01:24:36,325
- Can't you see what you're doing?
- Lock him up, !

923
01:24:36,445 --> 01:24:39,568
You can't! You're not going
to take her away from me again!

924
01:24:39,689 --> 01:24:42,091
No! No, you mustn't take him away!

925
01:24:42,171 --> 01:24:46,175
He's telling the truth!
He is my grandfather.

926
01:24:46,295 --> 01:24:49,857
My really and truly grandfather!
Please! Please let him go!

927
01:24:49,937 --> 01:24:51,859
- Come on! Don't be hysterical.
- Grandfather!

928
01:24:51,939 --> 01:24:54,503
We'll want you for the trial,
Take your child home,

929
01:24:54,623 --> 01:24:57,345
I am not her child! She's a bad lady!

930
01:24:57,465 --> 01:24:59,427
She tried to sell me to the Gypsies!

931
01:25:00,949 --> 01:25:02,429
Please.

932
01:25:02,549 --> 01:25:04,752
Please let the grandfather take me home.

933
01:25:04,872 --> 01:25:07,194
He didn't mean to do anything bad.

934
01:25:07,314 --> 01:25:09,596
I'll work hard and pay back
for everything he broke.

935
01:25:09,717 --> 01:25:12,639
- So will Swanly and Bearly.
- Pay no attention to her.

936
01:25:12,759 --> 01:25:14,721
She'll be all right when I get her to bed.

937
01:25:14,801 --> 01:25:17,524
I won't go with her!
She broke my snowstorm...

938
01:25:17,604 --> 01:25:21,648
and sent my Aunt Dete away so she
couldn't take me home to the mountains!

939
01:25:21,768 --> 01:25:25,972
If you don't believe me
just ask Herr Sesemann.

940
01:25:26,092 --> 01:25:31,136
- He'll tell you the truth.
- Herr Sesemann?

941
01:25:31,256 --> 01:25:34,020
What has Herr Sesemann to do with this?

942
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:36,982
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
- He has too.

943
01:25:37,102 --> 01:25:39,984
Aunt Dete brought me
there to play with Klara.

944
01:25:40,105 --> 01:25:43,148
- I taught her her how to walk.
- Oh, this is ridiculous.

945
01:25:43,228 --> 01:25:44,830
- Come along.
- Just a minute.

946
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:48,673
Well, now, Lieutenant... Perhaps
we'd better send for Herr Sesemann.

947
01:25:48,794 --> 01:25:52,836
Oh, absurd! We-Well, we visited
the Sesemann house tonight.

948
01:25:52,957 --> 01:25:55,079
Christmas, you know.
My sister's governess there.

949
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:58,602
It would be highly improper
to disturb Herr Sesemann at this hour!

950
01:25:58,682 --> 01:26:00,644
I think you'd better wait until we hear...

951
01:26:00,764 --> 01:26:03,847
what Herr Sesemann has got to say.

952
01:26:03,967 --> 01:26:07,851
Grandfather! Grandfather!

953
01:26:16,179 --> 01:26:19,141
Dear, dear, dear.

954
01:26:19,261 --> 01:26:23,305
Seems quite impossible.
Nothing emerges from the spigot.

955
01:26:23,425 --> 01:26:25,828
- Not that way!
- Oh.

956
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:30,352
That way.

957
01:26:30,472 --> 01:26:32,635
My word!

958
01:26:32,755 --> 01:26:37,479
I say, Bearly's
a very warm goat, isn't she?

959
01:26:37,599 --> 01:26:41,643
- Of course, silly. All goats are warm.
- How cozy.

960
01:26:41,763 --> 01:26:44,845
Heidi, ! Heidi, ! They're coming, !

961
01:26:44,925 --> 01:26:47,167
Really ought to master this.

962
01:26:51,772 --> 01:26:54,175
Let's have a race to the grandfather.

963
01:26:59,499 --> 01:27:01,581
Well, well.

964
01:27:01,701 --> 01:27:03,663
Oh, Grandfather, this is Klara.

965
01:27:03,783 --> 01:27:06,466
And just think-she beat me running!

966
01:27:06,546 --> 01:27:08,788
And I beat Herr Sesemann.

967
01:27:08,908 --> 01:27:11,110
How do you do?

968
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:14,233
This is the grandmother and Goat Peter.

969
01:27:15,274 --> 01:27:17,796
And this is Pastor Schultz
and Frau Schultz.

970
01:27:17,916 --> 01:27:19,958
I guess I can't deny it this time.

971
01:27:20,078 --> 01:27:21,840
They were married yesterday.

972
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:24,042
Come, sit down, all of you!

973
01:27:24,122 --> 01:27:27,286
You must be starved
after your climb up the mountain.

974
01:27:30,088 --> 01:27:32,650
Bless us, O Lord, in these Thy gifts...

975
01:27:32,770 --> 01:27:34,352
which we are about to
receive from Thy bounty.

976
01:27:34,372 --> 01:27:38,456
And please make every little boy and
girl in the world as happy as I am. Amen.
