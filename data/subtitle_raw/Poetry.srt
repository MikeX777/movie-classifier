IT STILL SEEMS LIKE MY SON IS ALIVE

15
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:27,771
- Ms. YANG Mija
- Here

16
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:29,006
This way

17
00:04:44,798 --> 00:04:46,288
What's wrong?

18
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:48,332
My arm

19
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:51,863
My right arm feels prickly

20
00:04:58,411 --> 00:04:59,810
Does it hurt here?

21
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:03,007
No, it doesn't hurt,
it just feels prickly

22
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:05,380
Like...

23
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:08,181
That thing is passing through

24
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:10,715
What's it called?

25
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:14,425
It's been like this lately

26
00:05:15,795 --> 00:05:20,232
It's... like energy

27
00:05:21,034 --> 00:05:23,502
- Electricity?
- Right, electricity!

28
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:26,800
It's like electricity's
passing through

29
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:30,910
I'm forgetting words lately

30
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:36,714
Yesterday, I couldn't
remember,'bleach'

31
00:05:36,783 --> 00:05:39,183
I could only remember, 'Clorox.'

32
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,351
We used to call bleach, 'Clorox'
back in the old days

33
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:45,550
How long have you
been like this?

34
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:48,656
For the past couple of days

35
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:53,592
No, your forgetfulness
When did it start?

36
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,100
When did it start?

37
00:05:55,201 --> 00:05:58,762
Maybe this summer or spring?

38
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:02,206
How old are you, ma'am?

39
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:07,746
Sixty five, no, sixty six

40
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:15,480
Your arm's prickly because
the muscles are in knots

41
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:17,681
Start some light exercising

42
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:24,123
I'm more concerned that you
can't remember words

43
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:27,032
It could be a bad sign

44
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:32,138
I recommend you get an
overhaul at a big hospital

45
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:34,239
A big hospital?

46
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:38,843
Yes, like a big general hospital
in Seoul

47
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:41,409
I'll write a reference for you

48
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:47,585
I'm at the hospital

49
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:50,219
My arm feels prickly

50
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,022
It's continues feeling prickly

51
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,287
I kept telling myself to see
a doctor and I finally did

52
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:03,929
Who else would come
with me, you idiot?

53
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,941
Your mom's okay

54
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:16,940
Others my age usually suffer
from neuralgia or arthritis

55
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,413
I'm okay

56
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:23,582
Don't cry, mom...

57
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:27,617
How could you be so cruel!

58
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:31,494
How could you...

59
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:34,098
You can't go way like this!

60
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:38,103
Where are you! Where did she go!

61
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:41,635
Oh god!

62
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,140
You cruel wench!

63
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:55,286
Where is she?
Where!

64
00:07:57,423 --> 00:07:58,481
Mom...

65
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,985
- Hello
- You're here

66
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,686
You're a little late

67
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,756
I went to the hospital

68
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,697
He called twicel received two calls, asking
why you weren't coming

69
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:52,636
Dad, the maid's on her way up

70
00:09:12,632 --> 00:09:14,964
This one, this one

71
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:18,966
Sit still! I told you
to sit still!

72
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:20,497
Stop it!

73
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,098
How will I undress you
if you resist like this?

74
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:27,576
Right, that's it
Pull this leg out

75
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:31,179
That's how you do it

76
00:09:43,463 --> 00:09:45,863
Is it hot? It's okay, isn't it?

77
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:49,126
Sit still!

78
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:51,935
Sit still, I say! Stop it!

79
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:54,433
- Why are you shouting?
- What?

80
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:55,574
What's that?

81
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:59,372
My hearing... so why?

82
00:10:01,214 --> 00:10:04,945
Your hearing is fine so
why I am shouting?

83
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:06,783
I'm sorry

84
00:10:07,887 --> 00:10:09,445
I won't shout again

85
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:27,929
Sir, I'll be leaving

86
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,133
Goodbye

87
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:31,639
- Done?
- Pardon?

88
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:35,845
- I said, are you done?
- Yes, I'm done

89
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,280
- Already?
- What do you mean?

90
00:10:40,553 --> 00:10:42,748
It's already been 3 hours

91
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:45,823
I did the laundry, the cleaning
and all my chores

92
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:02,999
Good

93
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:07,339
Thank you, sir

94
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:09,445
Don't...

95
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:12,284
tell anyone...

96
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:14,714
I gave it to you

97
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,589
Okay

98
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,267
How generous!

99
00:11:38,678 --> 00:11:40,168
Thank you

100
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:44,948
Did he yell at you today?

101
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:46,916
Of course he did

102
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:49,677
I doesn't matter cause
I yelled back at him

103
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:51,655
Here

104
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,520
- He gave me 10,000Won
- He did?

105
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,124
But he told me not to tell anyone

106
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:03,862
When it's only 10,000Won

107
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,333
My father-in-law is
notorious for being stingy

108
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:11,676
He must really like you. To give
you an amount like that

109
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:15,579
Anyway, do you always look
so chic like that?

110
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:19,410
Do I look chic?
I'm not chic at all

111
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,811
Where is it? Not again

112
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:25,184
What are you looking for?

113
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:29,492
What's that thing?
I can't remember the word

114
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,495
What you put money in

115
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:34,063
It's this big

116
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,326
A wallet?

117
00:12:36,169 --> 00:12:37,431
That's it, a wallet!

118
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:40,605
Where's my wallet?

119
00:12:41,107 --> 00:12:43,098
What's this?

120
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:50,207
I'm so out of it these days

121
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:58,588
At the hospital
I saw something...

122
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:03,322
A local middle school girl's
body was found in the river

123
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:05,489
And brought to the hospital

124
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:11,060
They said it was suicide
by jumping off the bridge

125
00:13:12,271 --> 00:13:17,072
The poor girl's mom was
totally out of her mind...

126
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,707
- I'll be on my way.
- See you the day after tomorrow

127
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:52,309
The deadline's over

128
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:00,850
What're you drying?

129
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:05,356
Did your daughter call?

130
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:15,557
LITERARY CLASS FORTHE PUBLIC
YOU CAN ALSO BE A POET!

131
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,040
Are you home, Wook?

132
00:14:27,914 --> 00:14:31,782
Why's the music on so loud?

133
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:33,645
You'll bring down the house

134
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:42,691
What's wrong?

135
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:44,524
Are you feeling sick?

136
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:46,787
Don't bother

137
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:29,373
I called you during the day
but you weren't answering

138
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:31,709
I never got your call

139
00:15:31,877 --> 00:15:34,744
How can you say that
when I called twice

140
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:36,312
I'm not lying

141
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:41,011
It's cause my mobile's junk
Buy me a new one

142
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:42,577
I'm annoyed with my mobile

143
00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:45,384
You just bought it, so why
do you need a new one?

144
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:49,861
- But I had it for 1 and 1/2 yr
- No you didn't

145
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:53,557
I got it during the 1 st semester
of my 2nd year

146
00:15:54,767 --> 00:16:00,000
Which only shows how
carelessly you've used it

147
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:04,509
You're sprouting a moustache,
but acting like a child

148
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,437
Why'd you call anyway?

149
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:12,846
I heard a girl in your school
killed herself...

150
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:14,579
by jumping into the river

151
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:17,479
I wanted to ask you about it

152
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:19,454
Ask me what?

153
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:24,628
Who she was, why'd she
kill herself that young

154
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:27,755
I don't know her that well

155
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:30,199
What's her name?

156
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:32,696
Why do you need her name?

157
00:16:32,772 --> 00:16:35,104
Aren't you in the same grade?

158
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:37,471
I don't know everyone
in the same grade

159
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:47,712
Grandma can't afford a new
mobile. Ask your mom for one

160
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:51,521
What? That's not fair!

161
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:24,884
Hey! Play with a bit
more spirit

162
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,156
This is no fun

163
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,021
Just try

164
00:17:29,762 --> 00:17:33,061
The doctor told me to exercise

165
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,111
What are you doing?

166
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:55,278
Where are you going?

167
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:57,121
Gotta go see my buddies

168
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,152
You shouldn't go out
at this hour!

169
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:11,866
The electricity bill's
quite high this month

170
00:18:12,304 --> 00:18:14,602
Wook's always on the computer...

171
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:16,598
playing music all the time

172
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:19,503
He even sleeps with the music on

173
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:22,112
How am I supposed to scold him?

174
00:18:23,182 --> 00:18:24,843
Well what can I say?

175
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,813
He's the master of the house

176
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:30,214
What?

177
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:32,981
The Cultural Center

178
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:35,725
To learn poetry

179
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:39,160
What? Right

180
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:41,864
I do have a poet's vein

181
00:18:41,934 --> 00:18:44,960
Right. I do like flowers
and say odd things

182
00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:15,832
I'm here for the literary class

183
00:19:15,935 --> 00:19:19,132
Literary class?
But it's all closed

184
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:21,464
I know...

185
00:19:22,508 --> 00:19:25,875
But can't you accept
one more person?

186
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:27,742
I don't know...

187
00:19:28,814 --> 00:19:31,078
I really want to take this class

188
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:33,975
How should we deal with this?

189
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:42,223
To write poetry, you must
see WELL

190
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:45,497
The most important thing
in life is seeing

191
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:50,164
SEE
See. It's to see

192
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:52,236
- We live seeing things
- Right

193
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:54,704
It's important to see everything
surrounding us well

194
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:58,105
Now, I've brought
something with me

195
00:19:59,044 --> 00:19:59,976
What is it?

196
00:20:00,045 --> 00:20:02,104
- An apple
- Yes, it's an apple

197
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:05,075
I went out of my way to bring it

198
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:07,151
I'm a well-prepared teacher

199
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:11,483
Others are not as well-prepared
as I am

200
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,427
Now, about this apple

201
00:20:23,802 --> 00:20:27,670
How many times have you
seen an apple?

202
00:20:27,806 --> 00:20:28,898
A thousand?

203
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:31,101
Ten thousand?

204
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:33,271
A million? Wrong

205
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:37,343
You've never seen
an apple before

206
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:38,405
Not even once

207
00:20:38,717 --> 00:20:41,311
Up till now, you haven't
seen an apple for real

208
00:20:42,855 --> 00:20:45,323
To really know what an apple is...

209
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:48,517
to be interested in it,
to understand it,

210
00:20:48,994 --> 00:20:51,554
to converse with it
is really seeing it

211
00:20:51,997 --> 00:20:56,627
Gazing at it for a while
and observing its shadow...

212
00:20:56,702 --> 00:21:00,365
feeling its every curve,
turning it around,

213
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:03,074
taking a bite out of it,

214
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:06,576
imagining the sunlight
absorbed in it...

215
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:08,872
That is really seeing it

216
00:21:09,081 --> 00:21:13,450
If you really see something,
you can feel...

217
00:21:13,886 --> 00:21:15,547
something naturally,

218
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:17,756
like water gathering in a spring

219
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,420
You should prepare
paper and a pencil,

220
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:22,788
and wait for the moment to come

221
00:21:23,295 --> 00:21:25,354
Empty white paper...

222
00:21:25,698 --> 00:21:29,964
A world of pure potential,
a world before creation...

223
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:32,333
This is the perfect
moment for a poet

224
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:35,999
Hold your pencil over
that pure paper...

225
00:21:37,076 --> 00:21:38,634
I love pencils

226
00:21:39,478 --> 00:21:43,244
When I place a well-sharpened
pencil over a piece of paper,

227
00:21:43,616 --> 00:21:46,517
I feel full

228
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:51,353
My heart flutters with the hope
of writing a good poem

229
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:54,218
I love sharpening pencils

230
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:55,917
The very fun of a pencil
is hand-sharpening it

231
00:21:56,028 --> 00:21:57,495
I used to be good at
sharpening pencils

232
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:58,528
Pardon?

233
00:21:59,431 --> 00:22:02,958
I was told to be a
good pencil-sharpener

234
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:07,200
I sharpened all my brothers'
and sisters' pencils

235
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:10,266
Is that so? Then, ma'am

236
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:12,536
Why don't you sharpen
my pencil some day

237
00:22:14,046 --> 00:22:18,107
By the time this 1 month
class ends,

238
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:21,184
I want you all to have written
a poem, okay?

239
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:23,884
Everyone has to write one poem

240
00:22:24,323 --> 00:22:26,052
You need to write
to really know

241
00:22:26,091 --> 00:22:27,558
You'll never know if
you don't write

242
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:30,595
So you have to write yourself

243
00:22:30,796 --> 00:22:33,026
Who has written a poem
at least once before?

244
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:39,527
And who hasn't?

245
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:44,836
Okay

246
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:48,269
Now you will be writing
your own poem...

247
00:22:48,347 --> 00:22:50,315
for the first time in your life

248
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,281
- Okay?
- Okay

249
00:23:47,272 --> 00:23:48,296
Who is it?

250
00:23:49,108 --> 00:23:50,097
My friends

251
00:23:50,275 --> 00:23:53,039
Why are your friends
here? It's late

252
00:23:53,145 --> 00:23:54,305
We need to talk

253
00:23:54,379 --> 00:23:58,213
About what? Haven't you seen
enough of each other?

254
00:24:00,385 --> 00:24:01,283
Hello, ma'am

255
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,684
Good evening

256
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:27,705
Why's the door locked?

257
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:31,310
What?

258
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:32,906
Why did you lock the door?

259
00:24:34,553 --> 00:24:38,011
Aren't you boys hungry?
Want some apples?

260
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:41,191
No, stop bothering us
It's annoying

261
00:24:52,638 --> 00:24:56,506
Apples are better for eating
than looking at

262
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:31,907
What are you looking at?

263
00:25:32,644 --> 00:25:33,770
The tree

264
00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:37,310
Why are you looking up the tree?

265
00:25:37,883 --> 00:25:39,714
To see it well

266
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:42,981
To feel it,

267
00:25:43,222 --> 00:25:45,281
to understand its thoughts and...

268
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,790
listen to what it says to me

269
00:26:00,906 --> 00:26:01,998
Hello?

270
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:04,934
Who?

271
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:07,444
Kibum's dad?

272
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,745
Yes, of course I know Kibum...

273
00:26:12,584 --> 00:26:15,781
who always hangs out
with Wook

274
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:18,483
Of course

275
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:23,320
He was at our place last night

276
00:26:25,631 --> 00:26:27,121
What's the matter?

277
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,558
Is something wrong?

278
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:36,203
Not now.

279
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:43,543
I... have to go to my poetry class

280
00:26:45,217 --> 00:26:46,650
Poetry!

281
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,011
Poetry!

282
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:53,981
I'll be done by
12pm

283
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:57,294
The Cultural Center

284
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:00,855
Yes

285
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:03,867
Okay, I'll see you then

286
00:27:18,684 --> 00:27:20,413
Writing poetry is...

287
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:23,517
all about finding beauty
Understand?

288
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:26,281
It is about discovering
true beauty...

289
00:27:26,358 --> 00:27:28,451
in everything we see
in front of us...

290
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,593
in our everyday life

291
00:27:32,264 --> 00:27:33,731
True beauty...

292
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:36,797
Not things just
looking beautiful

293
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:41,572
Every single one of you...
carries poetry in your heart

294
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:46,075
But you've imprisoned them
It's time to free your poetry

295
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:50,142
Your poetry trapped inside
should get their wings...

296
00:27:50,248 --> 00:27:51,806
and fly away

297
00:27:53,552 --> 00:27:54,746
Sir

298
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,154
When does a 'poetic
Inspiration' come?

299
00:27:57,856 --> 00:27:59,824
When does a 'poetic inspiration'
come?

300
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:04,524
Yes, as much as I try,
it won't come

301
00:28:04,696 --> 00:28:07,631
I'd like to know,
when does it come?

302
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,292
It doesn't. You must go
and beg for it

303
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,066
You must pray but even
this guarantees nothing

304
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:16,834
It's too precious
to give itself out

305
00:28:16,942 --> 00:28:20,378
That's why you must
go and beg for it

306
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:22,003
Where must I go?

307
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:26,511
It's not in some special place,

308
00:28:26,651 --> 00:28:28,881
but somewhere you must
wander around for

309
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:31,684
It isn't waiting for you
with a name plate...

310
00:28:31,923 --> 00:28:33,117
saying, 'poetic inspiration'

311
00:28:33,225 --> 00:28:34,624
The clear thing is,

312
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,388
it is somewhere nearby,
not far away

313
00:28:37,496 --> 00:28:40,488
It's there, right where
you stand

314
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:44,968
I told you poetry can be found
even in the dishwashing basin

315
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:48,704
Where are you?

316
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:51,737
The car with blinking lights?

317
00:28:58,884 --> 00:29:00,112
- Hello
- Hello

318
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:01,718
You're Wook's grandma,
aren't you?

319
00:29:01,787 --> 00:29:03,414
- Are you Kibum's dad?
- Yes

320
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:05,880
Let's get in the car

321
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:09,557
Where are we going?

322
00:29:11,463 --> 00:29:14,261
You know our boys' group of six?

323
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:17,392
The boys' parents are getting
together for lunch

324
00:29:17,736 --> 00:29:19,636
You can come with me
I'll take you there

325
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:42,093
What kind of class
are you taking?

326
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:46,253
I'm learning poetry
Twice a week

327
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:47,624
Poetry?

328
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:50,398
You mean singing
traditional poetry?

329
00:29:51,436 --> 00:29:53,836
No, actually writing poetry

330
00:29:55,674 --> 00:29:57,164
Why are you learning poetry?

331
00:29:58,076 --> 00:29:59,168
I wonder myself

332
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:01,838
Why am I learning poetry?

333
00:30:04,716 --> 00:30:08,584
Long ago, I must've been
in the third grade...

334
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,979
when we used to have
poetry contests in the fall

335
00:30:14,126 --> 00:30:17,527
After one contest, my teacher
told me,

336
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:20,622
"Mija, you'll become
a poet one day"

337
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,596
Then, recently I saw the
literary class poster

338
00:30:26,004 --> 00:30:28,802
And it reminded me of
the comment...

339
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:31,903
my teacher made 50 years ago

340
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:35,375
So you want to be a poet?

341
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:39,749
For now, my goal is
to write one poem

342
00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:44,522
Our teacher told us to write
one poem until the class ends

343
00:30:45,657 --> 00:30:48,148
When I told my daughter
about this,

344
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,760
she said I always had
a poet's vein

345
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:53,088
I always loved flowers...

346
00:30:53,932 --> 00:30:56,366
and would say odd things

347
00:30:57,636 --> 00:31:00,332
Your daughter's Wook's
mom, right? Where's she now?

348
00:31:04,376 --> 00:31:09,746
We talk about everything on
the phone. We're good friends

349
00:31:09,915 --> 00:31:11,439
Friends forever

350
00:31:13,518 --> 00:31:15,986
Anyway, what's this all about?

351
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:20,289
Let's just go there first

352
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,754
You'll see after you hear
what they have to say

353
00:31:23,595 --> 00:31:26,928
It's not good news, right?
I can feel it

354
00:31:27,832 --> 00:31:28,856
Right

355
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:31,559
It is bad news

356
00:31:35,073 --> 00:31:37,701
A large spicy fish stew
and steamed spicy angler fish...

357
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:39,770
-
- And 3 bottles of beer
- Okay

358
00:31:39,878 --> 00:31:41,243
I don't see your boss today

359
00:31:41,313 --> 00:31:43,679
He's away on business in Seoul

360
00:31:43,782 --> 00:31:45,647
- So, he's not coming today?
- No

361
00:31:46,051 --> 00:31:47,916
- We'll have the beer first
- Yes, sir

362
00:31:54,893 --> 00:31:59,057
Soonchang's dad, why
don't you start explaining

363
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:05,201
Let's start when the beers come
We need to lift the mood...

364
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,602
Do we need alcohol now?

365
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:10,499
Let's start since we don't
have much time

366
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:14,605
Then I'll start

367
00:32:16,815 --> 00:32:22,082
I'll give you a short recap as
some of you have no idea

368
00:32:23,188 --> 00:32:27,989
Recently, a girl at our boys'
school, killed herself

369
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:29,855
Her name's PARK Heejin

370
00:32:30,061 --> 00:32:33,497
Her folks run a farm nearby

371
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,236
She kept a diary stating
six male students...

372
00:32:39,337 --> 00:32:43,501
raping her for months
until her death

373
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,705
Reading her diary, her folks
reported this to the school...

374
00:32:50,949 --> 00:32:54,077
who called the boys in to talk

375
00:32:54,352 --> 00:32:56,320
The six all admitted...

376
00:32:57,188 --> 00:33:00,157
to the crime, so I guess
it must be true

377
00:33:00,692 --> 00:33:02,250
At first, it started
with two boys,

378
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:04,192
KWON Soonchang

379
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,929
That's my son

380
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:11,197
- And KIM Jongchul
- Yes, that's my son

381
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:14,167
It's those two who started it

382
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:19,767
And as time passed,
all six of them joined in

383
00:33:19,878 --> 00:33:22,369
They say they didn't
coerce her at first

384
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:27,475
- That she liked doing it
- Who would believe that?

385
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:32,456
It would only incite
more anger

386
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:34,754
Yes, you're right

387
00:33:34,826 --> 00:33:35,815
Ladies first

388
00:33:36,027 --> 00:33:39,827
They said, the girl was
short and plain-looking

389
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:42,662
So I can't understand
why they did it

390
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:44,529
And if she was tall and pretty?

391
00:33:45,136 --> 00:33:48,799
Where in school did they do it?
And for six months?

392
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:50,875
They said they did it in
the science lab

393
00:33:51,476 --> 00:33:55,378
KOO Taeyeol being leader of the
Science Club, had the lab keys

394
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:57,604
That's my son

395
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:00,711
The lab's located in
a secluded area

396
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:02,810
And rarely had classes or
was tended to

397
00:34:02,887 --> 00:34:04,377
So, nobody knew

398
00:34:04,556 --> 00:34:06,990
Although I feel sorry for...

399
00:34:07,058 --> 00:34:08,457
the dead girl,

400
00:34:08,993 --> 00:34:12,292
now's the time for us to
worry about our own boys

401
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:14,762
That's why I called
everyone here

402
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:17,562
Joint action is crucial now

403
00:34:18,603 --> 00:34:21,299
Right, we should act as a group

404
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:26,433
Cheers, ma'am

405
00:34:33,518 --> 00:34:35,247
The girl's parents...

406
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:39,990
- run a farm?
- Yes, but her dad died...

407
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:42,826
a few years ago from
a motorcycle accident

408
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:47,228
The mom has been raising the
girl and her brother alone

409
00:34:47,332 --> 00:34:49,493
We need to calm the mom

410
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:53,664
Fortunately, it seems she
hasn't told anyone else

411
00:34:55,073 --> 00:34:58,065
But we can't tell
what she's thinking

412
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:02,836
Nevertheless, in order to
console the victim's family...

413
00:35:03,148 --> 00:35:05,946
So the point is, the
compensation money

414
00:35:06,217 --> 00:35:07,343
That's right

415
00:35:08,553 --> 00:35:11,954
Regarding the money,
we should reach an agreement

416
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:14,582
I discussed this with the school...

417
00:35:14,659 --> 00:35:17,059
and 30 million Won would be
the proper amount

418
00:35:17,162 --> 00:35:20,029
So that makes it
5 million Won per person

419
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:24,434
Who else knows about this?

420
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:26,867
The principal and a few
other teachers...

421
00:35:26,938 --> 00:35:28,769
and one or two in the police

422
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:31,774
Our talks with the school and
the police are going well so far

423
00:35:31,876 --> 00:35:34,504
The school doesn't want this
to get leaked outside

424
00:35:34,612 --> 00:35:37,382
And the police doesn't
want to investigate...

425
00:35:37,382 --> 00:35:39,873
unless the victim's family
press charges

426
00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:45,287
The problem is that a local
newspaper sniffed something...

427
00:35:45,356 --> 00:35:47,916
and are calling the school,
asking questions

428
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:51,187
The local press is insidious,
so watch your mouth

429
00:35:52,864 --> 00:35:54,855
What's she doing over there?

430
00:35:56,434 --> 00:35:58,834
What a clueless old lady

431
00:35:59,037 --> 00:36:01,938
What's she doing at
a moment like this?

432
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,735
Did you say she's
Wook's grandma?

433
00:36:03,842 --> 00:36:05,935
Is she raising him by herself?

434
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:07,534
Her daughter left Wook...

435
00:36:07,645 --> 00:36:11,877
with her mom after her divorce
and is in Busan now

436
00:36:12,317 --> 00:36:14,444
Unlike her looks,
she's barely getting by

437
00:36:14,552 --> 00:36:18,113
She lives off government subsidy
and her part-time maid job

438
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,457
I think her daughter's
not sending her money

439
00:36:21,526 --> 00:36:24,620
Then how's she gonna pay
the 5 million Won she owes?

440
00:36:25,163 --> 00:36:29,099
She has no choice. Her
grandson's future depends on it

441
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,666
Ma'am

442
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:38,639
Are you writing a poem?

443
00:36:39,377 --> 00:36:40,935
Just taking notes

444
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:43,173
We always have to take
notes like this

445
00:36:43,314 --> 00:36:44,679
What have you written there?

446
00:36:46,351 --> 00:36:47,375
Blood...

447
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:49,683
A flower as red as blood

448
00:36:51,189 --> 00:36:53,214
They really are blood red

449
00:36:57,795 --> 00:37:00,286
Do you know the floral
meaning of cockscomb?

450
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:01,963
It's 'shield'

451
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:04,558
Actually, it looks like a shield

452
00:37:06,037 --> 00:37:08,267
A shield that protect us

453
00:37:15,113 --> 00:37:17,445
Let's go inside and
get something to eat

454
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:48,476
Awe, not curry again!

455
00:37:48,546 --> 00:37:50,673
What's wrong?
You like curry

456
00:37:50,882 --> 00:37:55,148
- I had it for lunch at school
- Really? I didn't know

457
00:38:20,011 --> 00:38:21,808
Did you pack your gym suit?

458
00:38:22,146 --> 00:38:24,046
It's physical education day,
right?

459
00:38:24,148 --> 00:38:24,944
I packed it

460
00:40:10,388 --> 00:40:11,514
Hello?

461
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:15,117
Yes, hello

462
00:40:16,894 --> 00:40:21,695
What? With the vice principal?

463
00:40:23,134 --> 00:40:24,294
Yes

464
00:40:25,503 --> 00:40:26,970
What time?

465
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:30,664
Not many at school
know about this

466
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:33,575
The discipline instructor
here and I know

467
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:37,044
And only the dead girl's
homeroom teacher knows

468
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:39,208
But not the boys' homeroom
teachers

469
00:40:39,283 --> 00:40:42,684
I told the girl's teacher not to
disclose this to anyone...

470
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:46,852
as it will destroy the boys'
future and the school

471
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:50,086
So you should watch what you say

472
00:40:50,328 --> 00:40:52,694
You don't have to worry
about us, sir

473
00:40:53,498 --> 00:40:55,398
Since the boys' future are at stake,

474
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,024
we are being careful

475
00:40:57,135 --> 00:40:59,330
You cannot even sleep-talk

476
00:40:59,403 --> 00:41:04,238
Above all, hurry and settle
with the girl's family

477
00:41:04,308 --> 00:41:06,105
How did you decide
on the compensation?

478
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:12,241
Everything considered, we've
decided to pay 30 million Won

479
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,978
We believe that amount
will be adequate

480
00:41:15,052 --> 00:41:18,818
So, have you all agreed on
the 30 million Won?

481
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,648
Yes, of course

482
00:41:21,092 --> 00:41:25,791
Someone can't pay yet,
but everyone has agreed

483
00:41:26,564 --> 00:41:30,500
Just hurry and settle things
with the girl's family

484
00:41:31,102 --> 00:41:33,332
Okay.

485
00:41:55,092 --> 00:42:00,655
<i>All ye be awake and pray to</i>
<i>stand before of the Son of Man</i>

486
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:10,939
INFORMATION: REQUIEM MASS
FOR AGNES, PARK HEEJIN

487
00:42:17,882 --> 00:42:21,579
<i>And I will raise them up</i>
<i>on the last day</i>

488
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:24,085
<i>These are the Lord's words</i>

489
00:42:24,388 --> 00:42:27,551
<i>Praise Christ our Lord</i>

490
00:42:29,293 --> 00:42:33,457
<i>Today, we are gathered here</i>
<i>to offer this Requiem Mass</i> to...

491
00:42:33,564 --> 00:42:37,193
<i>Agnes PARKHeejin who</i>
<i>left us a few days ago</i>

492
00:42:37,568 --> 00:42:42,403
<i>We lament this precious life</i>
<i>taken at the youthful age of 16</i>

493
00:42:42,473 --> 00:42:47,638
<i>But we believe in God's words,</i>
<i>'He who believes in</i> me...

494
00:42:47,712 --> 00:42:50,579
<i>will live, even though he dies'</i>

495
00:42:51,015 --> 00:42:54,644
We believe God will comfort
Agnes' soul...

496
00:42:55,086 --> 00:42:58,055
and grant her the
happiness in Heaven...

497
00:42:58,122 --> 00:43:01,751
she never found on earth

498
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:04,589
So we pray for Agnes...

499
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:07,297
that God will embrace...

500
00:43:07,365 --> 00:43:10,664
the pain she had endured

501
00:43:10,735 --> 00:43:15,172
So she will have eternal life
in Heaven

502
00:43:15,573 --> 00:43:18,064
As one heart, we offer our...

503
00:43:18,175 --> 00:43:21,542
most devoted prayer

504
00:43:21,612 --> 00:43:23,136
All rise

505
00:43:24,982 --> 00:43:28,782
For our Father who has raised
Christ from the dead,

506
00:43:28,886 --> 00:43:31,878
let us pray for Agnes'
salvation

507
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:35,686
Lord, let Agnes who has received
eternal life through...

508
00:43:35,793 --> 00:43:40,924
the sacrament of Baptism,
join the line of saviors

509
00:43:41,198 --> 00:43:45,100
Lord, please hear our prayer...

510
00:43:45,202 --> 00:43:49,298
For Agnes who has accepted
the Blessed Sacrament,

511
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:53,844
but has left us
This is our utmost appeal...

512
00:43:53,945 --> 00:43:58,712
that you raise her again to be
back in your embrace

513
00:43:58,983 --> 00:44:02,646
Lord, please hear our prayer

514
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:08,716
We also pray for her mourning
family and relatives

515
00:44:08,826 --> 00:44:12,660
Please grant them peace
in their hearts

516
00:44:12,897 --> 00:44:16,628
Lord, please hear our prayer

517
00:44:16,701 --> 00:44:21,297
We pray in the name of
Christ our Lord

518
00:44:21,472 --> 00:44:24,032
Amen

519
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:08,273
- Something wrong?
- What?

520
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:10,447
Is something wrong?

521
00:46:10,548 --> 00:46:12,846
Nothing's wrong
Why do you ask?

522
00:46:13,384 --> 00:46:16,148
You're very quiet

523
00:46:17,121 --> 00:46:21,888
You're always chirping
away like a skylark

524
00:46:22,193 --> 00:46:25,026
When was I chirping
away like a skylark?

525
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:29,229
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp

526
00:46:30,968 --> 00:46:33,562
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp

527
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,769
What's with the face?

528
00:46:42,146 --> 00:46:44,046
You look mad

529
00:46:44,815 --> 00:46:46,612
Smile

530
00:46:46,984 --> 00:46:48,417
I shouldn't smile

531
00:46:48,586 --> 00:46:49,917
Why not?

532
00:46:51,021 --> 00:46:55,981
Men used to tell me not to smile
cause it made them fall for me

533
00:46:56,393 --> 00:46:59,089
They all went gaga over
me when I smiled

534
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:03,189
You'll do the same if I smiled

535
00:49:10,427 --> 00:49:11,724
Come out!

536
00:49:12,696 --> 00:49:13,890
Now!

537
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:23,071
Look at the mess you've
sloughed off!

538
00:49:23,207 --> 00:49:26,973
Snack wrappings, socks,
tissue, the remote control!

539
00:49:30,247 --> 00:49:32,442
How many times has
grandma told you?

540
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:34,881
That even animals clean up
after themselves!

541
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:42,288
Your socks, too!

542
00:50:01,345 --> 00:50:04,940
<i>Tomorrow the discomfort index</i>
<i>will be quite high due</i> to...

543
00:50:05,015 --> 00:50:06,744
<i>the heat and humidity</i>

544
00:50:06,817 --> 00:50:11,948
<i>Especially, it will rate the</i>
<i>highest between 3-4pm</i>

545
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:13,751
<i>Let's take a look at the</i>
<i>clouds on the surface map</i>

546
00:50:14,191 --> 00:50:17,126
<i>A few cloud masses are</i>
<i>passing through the south...</i>

547
00:50:17,227 --> 00:50:20,492
<i>and thin mist is scattered</i>
<i>along the central region</i>

548
00:50:20,564 --> 00:50:24,056
<i>Tomorrow, high pressure is</i>
<i>moving towards the Yellow Sea</i>

549
00:50:24,134 --> 00:50:26,364
<i>Jeju Isle and South Jeolla region...</i>

550
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:03,367
Get up, get up!

551
00:51:05,809 --> 00:51:07,140
Get up!

552
00:51:07,311 --> 00:51:09,541
Grandma has something
to say to you!

553
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,853
Get up!

554
00:51:18,789 --> 00:51:20,518
I said, get up!

555
00:51:23,961 --> 00:51:25,690
Why did you do it?

556
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:28,027
Why did you do it?

557
00:52:27,991 --> 00:52:29,288
Why are you stopping?

558
00:52:30,027 --> 00:52:31,551
I don't feel like eating

559
00:52:33,363 --> 00:52:36,423
What does grandma like
the most in the world?

560
00:52:39,069 --> 00:52:40,502
Do you know or not?

561
00:52:41,538 --> 00:52:42,698
I know

562
00:52:43,207 --> 00:52:44,469
What is it?

563
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:48,640
'Food going into Wook's mouth'

564
00:52:48,779 --> 00:52:50,110
Very good

565
00:53:05,529 --> 00:53:10,159
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOMENT
OF MY LIFE

566
00:53:11,235 --> 00:53:16,298
I was raised by my grandma

567
00:53:16,673 --> 00:53:20,871
So to me, my grandma was my mom

568
00:53:21,278 --> 00:53:24,509
My grandma really loved songs

569
00:53:24,581 --> 00:53:27,311
But she didn't know how to sing,

570
00:53:27,384 --> 00:53:32,253
because she was always
working so hard

571
00:53:33,223 --> 00:53:37,421
When I was really young,

572
00:53:38,962 --> 00:53:44,127
we had this large white paper,
the kind you use for rituals

573
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:47,666
I wrote lyrics on the paper

574
00:53:48,138 --> 00:53:52,268
And I taught my grandma to sing...

575
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:57,513
by pointing at each verse
with a chopstick

576
00:53:59,116 --> 00:54:04,748
I think this the most beautiful
moment of my life

577
00:54:06,123 --> 00:54:07,750
What was the song?

578
00:54:09,192 --> 00:54:10,887
'The Young Boat Woman'

579
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:16,766
My grandma passed
away last year

580
00:54:19,436 --> 00:54:22,337
I remember I sang this song
for my grandma...

581
00:54:22,472 --> 00:54:25,930
whenever I visited her place

582
00:54:26,577 --> 00:54:32,516
Because she always asked
me to sing it for her

583
00:54:32,716 --> 00:54:36,812
So, I always sang it for her

584
00:54:39,222 --> 00:54:42,157
I married very late

585
00:54:42,225 --> 00:54:46,389
And my first child was born
when I was almost forty

586
00:54:46,463 --> 00:54:49,159
Because it was my first
delivery at a late age,

587
00:54:49,232 --> 00:54:51,632
the doctors kept me on my toes...

588
00:54:51,835 --> 00:54:54,998
I held it out for 10 months and
finally labor pains began

589
00:54:55,105 --> 00:54:59,371
I never experienced such
pain before in my life

590
00:54:59,476 --> 00:55:01,910
Anyway, finally amidst the
pain, my baby was born...

591
00:55:02,012 --> 00:55:08,542
and I felt... something
slipping out...

592
00:55:08,785 --> 00:55:13,745
this fiery hot mass
like the sun

593
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,723
The moment the baby
burst into its first cry,

594
00:55:16,827 --> 00:55:19,955
was the most beautiful,
most amazing...

595
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:24,193
and emotional moment for me

596
00:55:24,835 --> 00:55:29,932
I don't have any
beautiful memories

597
00:55:30,307 --> 00:55:31,706
I'm sorry

598
00:55:34,978 --> 00:55:40,006
For 20 years, I lived in
a basement room

599
00:55:40,484 --> 00:55:44,477
Six years ago, I finally leased
an apartment in this town...

600
00:55:45,188 --> 00:55:49,818
which had a low deposit
and monthly rent

601
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,994
So I moved here

602
00:55:54,364 --> 00:55:57,800
I guess that was my
most beautiful moment

603
00:55:58,902 --> 00:56:01,530
I spread-eagle on the floor...

604
00:56:01,938 --> 00:56:07,740
feeling that I owned the world

605
00:57:12,409 --> 00:57:17,244
THE SOUND OF BIRDS SINGING
WHAT ARE THEY SINGING?

606
00:58:57,047 --> 00:58:59,140
<i>To write poetry</i> is...

607
00:58:59,783 --> 00:59:04,277
to remember mother's hands,
joint swollen,

608
00:59:05,255 --> 00:59:08,622
washing the white rice
at cold dawn...

609
00:59:08,692 --> 00:59:10,523
during winter solstice

610
00:59:10,627 --> 00:59:11,787
Are you here alone?

611
00:59:11,828 --> 00:59:14,763
Yes, I heard there's
a poetry reading

612
00:59:15,198 --> 00:59:18,802
Yes, please take a seat

613
00:59:18,802 --> 00:59:21,862
To write poetry is to wake alone
deep in the night weeping

614
00:59:21,938 --> 00:59:25,840
It is to build a
solid cornerstone...

615
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:28,805
to raise a pillar...

616
00:59:28,912 --> 00:59:32,313
in your broken heart

617
00:59:32,949 --> 00:59:37,511
It is to calm the bare corner
of the window,

618
00:59:37,587 --> 00:59:42,251
shaking all night,
with all your might

619
00:59:42,626 --> 00:59:48,189
It is to empty out without
hesitation...

620
00:59:48,298 --> 00:59:51,426
the rancid water that
keeps rising

621
00:59:54,004 --> 00:59:58,134
It is to create a forest of
empty void

622
00:59:59,509 --> 01:00:03,240
PEOPLE WHO LOVE POETRY
FRIDAY POETRY RECITAL

623
01:00:07,984 --> 01:00:10,145
They say people who
love poetry...

624
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:13,778
are those who always
have flowers in their heart

625
01:00:14,224 --> 01:00:18,160
Our Ms. CHO Mihye not only
has flowers in her heart,

626
01:00:18,461 --> 01:00:22,192
but has a pretty one
covering her heart

627
01:00:22,265 --> 01:00:23,493
Thank you

628
01:00:24,301 --> 01:00:29,238
Next will be Mr. LEE Dongkyu
in a red T-shirt...

629
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:33,435
who will be reciting, Ms. CHO's
'A Green-colored Cicada'

630
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,745
I always hear the sound of...

631
01:00:43,186 --> 01:00:45,620
a cicada emanating
from your back

632
01:00:46,189 --> 01:00:51,024
It cries, chirr, chirr,
rubbing its eyes

633
01:00:51,962 --> 01:00:55,523
As the stain of last summer's
forget-me-nots fade from...

634
01:00:56,232 --> 01:00:59,793
my fingertips, the cicada keeps
crying from your back

635
01:01:00,136 --> 01:01:01,569
I, too am crying...

636
01:01:01,805 --> 01:01:04,569
rubbing my wings

637
01:01:08,945 --> 01:01:12,312
This poem talks about
a green-colored cicada,

638
01:01:12,415 --> 01:01:14,940
but I thought of
an ordinary cicada

639
01:01:15,452 --> 01:01:18,683
In search of its mate,
the cicada...

640
01:01:19,255 --> 01:01:21,189
for a short few days, cries

641
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:25,091
to its fullest as if it's
smashing summer to pieces

642
01:01:25,528 --> 01:01:28,395
I wonder if I could do the same

643
01:01:28,898 --> 01:01:33,733
Living as passionately
as the cicada

644
01:01:34,037 --> 01:01:35,834
This thought continues to linger

645
01:01:35,905 --> 01:01:37,065
Thank you

646
01:01:41,711 --> 01:01:45,015
That was quite a commentary
from the heart

647
01:01:45,015 --> 01:01:49,679
He must have worn a red T-shirt
to show his burning passion

648
01:01:49,786 --> 01:01:54,416
Next will be Mr. PARK Sangtae
who's come after a long time

649
01:01:54,624 --> 01:01:57,525
Although his leg is not well
from an accident,

650
01:01:57,627 --> 01:02:00,653
he has kindly brought us
a large watermelon

651
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:04,997
Greetings

652
01:02:06,002 --> 01:02:08,436
- I was actually here before
- Oh, I see...

653
01:02:08,505 --> 01:02:10,268
- You weren't here last week
- Right

654
01:02:10,473 --> 01:02:13,169
So, saying 'after a long time'
would be inappropriate

655
01:02:13,209 --> 01:02:14,642
My mistake

656
01:02:14,744 --> 01:02:16,211
- Have you learned your lesson?
- Yes

657
01:02:22,018 --> 01:02:24,748
'The Rose Thorn's Reason'

658
01:02:25,989 --> 01:02:28,651
Don't try to steal me

659
01:02:29,592 --> 01:02:33,995
The day thorns within me rise
like goosebumps all over my body

660
01:02:34,431 --> 01:02:37,832
I dream of self-obliteration
with a crimson smile

661
01:02:38,034 --> 01:02:42,494
Don't try to break me
for being beautiful

662
01:02:42,872 --> 01:02:45,306
The kiss on red lips is...

663
01:02:45,508 --> 01:02:49,171
the desperate passion
for virginity

664
01:02:49,712 --> 01:02:53,273
Do not love me anymore

665
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:59,345
As the seasons' wheels
keep rolling on

666
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:02,585
I'm no expert,

667
01:03:03,093 --> 01:03:05,493
but what a mighty good
picture of the rose

668
01:03:05,595 --> 01:03:10,225
It is simply saying,
'do not eat me up'

669
01:03:12,535 --> 01:03:14,833
Here is the word, 'kiss'

670
01:03:15,171 --> 01:03:21,940
I thought about its
Chinese saying

671
01:03:22,445 --> 01:03:23,935
A kiss means...

672
01:03:24,047 --> 01:03:28,507
tongues coming and going
between two attached lips,

673
01:03:28,751 --> 01:03:32,346
so it would be 'Sulwang Sulreh'.
(tongue comes, tongue goes)

674
01:03:36,893 --> 01:03:41,262
A kiss means lips crashing
into each other

675
01:03:41,364 --> 01:03:45,232
Then what do you call
two cars crashing together...

676
01:03:45,301 --> 01:03:47,201
in a Chinese saying?

677
01:03:47,537 --> 01:03:49,004
Guhwang Guhreh
(car comes, car goes)

678
01:03:50,573 --> 01:03:53,508
So a car instead of
tongue, right?

679
01:03:53,576 --> 01:03:56,670
You're thinking too hard

680
01:03:56,779 --> 01:04:00,374
Two cars crashing together is...

681
01:04:01,251 --> 01:04:02,718
It's a 'Gyotong Sagoh'

682
01:04:02,819 --> 01:04:04,411
Car accident

683
01:04:06,689 --> 01:04:12,958
I hurt my leg in a car accident

684
01:04:13,062 --> 01:04:16,156
I'm staying at the hospital
now, but I slipped out today

685
01:04:17,467 --> 01:04:21,904
You know what I thought
when I hurt my leg?

686
01:04:22,672 --> 01:04:25,800
That it would be nice
if this here...

687
01:04:26,075 --> 01:04:28,976
my third leg popped out,

688
01:04:29,245 --> 01:04:34,342
to help me balance myself

689
01:04:35,585 --> 01:04:37,746
I still have to stay at the hospital,

690
01:04:38,021 --> 01:04:42,253
but next time, I'll be back
in great shape.

691
01:04:45,929 --> 01:04:49,990
- Can I sit here?
- Yes, of course

692
01:04:50,733 --> 01:04:54,032
I have something to ask you

693
01:04:54,137 --> 01:04:55,866
About what?

694
01:04:56,573 --> 01:04:59,167
Your poems are wonderful

695
01:04:59,475 --> 01:05:02,672
I still have a long way to go

696
01:05:03,246 --> 01:05:07,012
You said you started poetry
recently

697
01:05:07,116 --> 01:05:09,346
How could you write
such amazing poems?

698
01:05:09,986 --> 01:05:15,583
Well, in this case,
it came easily

699
01:05:16,226 --> 01:05:19,923
As I wrote a line, words
I was never aware of...

700
01:05:20,129 --> 01:05:23,929
unraveled like a thread of silk

701
01:05:24,267 --> 01:05:28,601
Like I was swimming
and floating in poems

702
01:05:28,838 --> 01:05:32,205
I wrote as if I was
a flying butterfly

703
01:05:33,943 --> 01:05:35,968
If only I could do the same!

704
01:05:36,379 --> 01:05:41,476
I've been trying to write poetry
myself, but I couldn't

705
01:05:42,352 --> 01:05:48,257
When I started to write
poetry, I also fiercely sought...

706
01:05:48,324 --> 01:05:49,814
poetic inspiration

707
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:53,219
But it made things more difficult

708
01:05:53,863 --> 01:05:57,162
The point is the feeling

709
01:05:58,134 --> 01:06:02,002
If you have the feeling,
you can write poetry

710
01:06:03,339 --> 01:06:06,137
But I do feel things...

711
01:06:07,343 --> 01:06:13,179
Then write them down honestly,
like you're taking notes

712
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:15,982
That's the most honest thing

713
01:06:31,234 --> 01:06:32,667
Hello

714
01:06:35,204 --> 01:06:37,866
It's not so stinky today

715
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:39,373
I guess you didn't shit yourself

716
01:06:43,813 --> 01:06:45,280
What's this?

717
01:06:46,449 --> 01:06:51,443
- Get this out for me
- What kind of pill is it?

718
01:06:51,621 --> 01:06:53,486
Why are you taking this pill?

719
01:06:54,257 --> 01:06:55,656
Are you sick?

720
01:06:56,392 --> 01:07:01,261
I'm not sick. It's just a nutrient

721
01:07:01,331 --> 01:07:04,562
Why take a nutrient
all the sudden?

722
01:07:05,134 --> 01:07:08,535
Why are you being such a nag?

723
01:07:09,072 --> 01:07:11,836
Just get it out for me

724
01:08:56,946 --> 01:08:58,311
Please

725
01:08:58,581 --> 01:09:00,981
Let go! Stop it!

726
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:04,819
Before I die,

727
01:09:05,054 --> 01:09:09,423
I wanna do it just for once

728
01:09:11,427 --> 01:09:14,021
I don't need anything else

729
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:16,527
Just for once...

730
01:09:17,834 --> 01:09:20,325
I wanna be a man

731
01:09:20,536 --> 01:09:22,060
It's my wish

732
01:09:22,972 --> 01:09:24,303
Let go of me!

733
01:09:25,241 --> 01:09:27,766
Who do you think I am?

734
01:09:29,946 --> 01:09:33,074
What was that pill you took?

735
01:09:39,655 --> 01:09:41,953
What kind of pill is this?

736
01:09:42,391 --> 01:09:45,292
It's that thing you call
Viagra, right?

737
01:09:54,871 --> 01:09:56,736
You go dry and dress yourself!

738
01:09:56,873 --> 01:09:58,898
No one else will from now on!

739
01:10:30,439 --> 01:10:31,463
Ms. YANG Mija!

740
01:10:31,541 --> 01:10:32,269
Here!

741
01:10:33,009 --> 01:10:34,909
Go to Room 1, please

742
01:10:34,977 --> 01:10:36,001
Okay

743
01:10:45,955 --> 01:10:47,252
Hello

744
01:10:47,356 --> 01:10:49,051
Please have a seat

745
01:11:01,304 --> 01:11:03,499
Oh, those are camellias!

746
01:11:05,341 --> 01:11:07,775
I just love camellias

747
01:11:08,411 --> 01:11:11,710
Flowers of winter,
flowers of pain...

748
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:14,472
Are camellias flowers of pain?

749
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:18,077
Yes, red flowers represent pain

750
01:11:18,588 --> 01:11:22,718
White is virginity, yellow is glory

751
01:11:23,626 --> 01:11:26,424
I've been studying lately
to write poetry

752
01:11:26,596 --> 01:11:28,530
Poetry? Are you a poet?

753
01:11:29,098 --> 01:11:32,226
No, I'm just trying to
write a poem

754
01:11:33,202 --> 01:11:34,760
Did you come alone?

755
01:11:35,004 --> 01:11:37,438
Nobody's with you?

756
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:39,371
I came by myself.
Why do you ask?

757
01:11:39,542 --> 01:11:42,705
I'd prefer talking to
someone else

758
01:11:42,812 --> 01:11:45,372
Why? Is there something wrong?

759
01:11:46,949 --> 01:11:48,507
The test results say...

760
01:11:49,852 --> 01:11:52,821
you've got Alzheimer's

761
01:11:53,255 --> 01:11:55,450
Often called, 'dementia'

762
01:11:55,825 --> 01:11:58,919
No, I'm fine

763
01:11:59,128 --> 01:12:00,857
You're fine for now

764
01:12:01,063 --> 01:12:03,293
Since it's at a very early stage

765
01:12:03,532 --> 01:12:06,000
But the disease has already
progressed

766
01:12:06,936 --> 01:12:11,066
You're occasionally
forgetting words for now,

767
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:14,839
but gradually your
memory loss will worsen

768
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:20,415
At first, you won't
recall nouns...

769
01:12:20,449 --> 01:12:23,145
and then verbs

770
01:12:23,386 --> 01:12:24,819
You know verbs, right?

771
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:28,352
Of course I know verbs

772
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:31,552
But nouns are the most important

773
01:12:31,694 --> 01:12:34,857
Right, nouns are most important

774
01:12:42,071 --> 01:12:43,732
Those are fake

775
01:12:50,646 --> 01:12:52,136
I'm at the hospital

776
01:12:53,015 --> 01:12:56,143
To get my test results

777
01:12:56,919 --> 01:12:58,045
Huh? What?

778
01:12:58,154 --> 01:12:59,746
The doctor says I'm okay

779
01:12:59,922 --> 01:13:01,048
She told me to exercise

780
01:13:01,524 --> 01:13:03,082
Exercise more

781
01:13:03,459 --> 01:13:06,587
The doctor also told me
to write poetry a lot

782
01:13:11,967 --> 01:13:13,594
Okay

783
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:20,270
Could you go to that place...

784
01:13:20,443 --> 01:13:21,637
Ah...

785
01:13:22,778 --> 01:13:26,942
Dongseoul, what was it?
It was a Dongseoul something...

786
01:13:27,349 --> 01:13:33,345
Where there are a lot of
cross-country buses

787
01:13:33,422 --> 01:13:35,947
- The bus terminal?
- Right, the bus terminal

788
01:13:36,225 --> 01:13:39,422
I get like this

789
01:14:18,167 --> 01:14:23,205
TIME PASSES AND
FLOWERS FADE

790
01:14:23,205 --> 01:14:27,164
<i>Wet lipstick on the wine glass</i>

791
01:14:28,444 --> 01:14:32,175
<i>With my yearning for you</i>

792
01:14:32,348 --> 01:14:34,475
- Which room is she in?
- Room No. 5

793
01:14:34,617 --> 01:14:35,584
Room No. 5?

794
01:14:36,552 --> 01:14:41,649
<i>I've been grabbing onto</i>
<i>the rope I had to release,</i>

795
01:14:41,724 --> 01:14:46,457
<i>but now's the time to let go</i>

796
01:14:48,998 --> 01:14:54,664
<i>You may have forgotten...</i>

797
01:14:55,571 --> 01:15:00,941
<i>my name by now</i>

798
01:15:02,545 --> 01:15:08,313
<i>But I crudely raise...</i>

799
01:15:09,084 --> 01:15:14,454
<i>a wineglass again because of you</i>

800
01:15:16,392 --> 01:15:22,331
<i>Now I wanna take off</i>
<i>my dress of attachment...</i>

801
01:15:22,965 --> 01:15:29,063
<i>and drink a glass of oblivion</i>

802
01:15:31,707 --> 01:15:32,867
Ma'am!

803
01:15:33,442 --> 01:15:34,909
You're really good!

804
01:15:35,511 --> 01:15:37,536
Oh my, don't embarrass me

805
01:15:37,713 --> 01:15:41,945
I got bored waiting for you,
so I was killing time

806
01:15:42,017 --> 01:15:44,850
You must have broken many
hearts back in the days

807
01:15:45,054 --> 01:15:47,716
You've got great appeal

808
01:15:48,657 --> 01:15:50,386
In fact,

809
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:52,954
I have too many stories to tell
about my past

810
01:15:53,028 --> 01:15:55,519
Anyway, what brings you here?

811
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,296
It's just that...

812
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:05,138
Regarding the 5 million
I have to pay

813
01:16:05,407 --> 01:16:08,399
Can you lend me the money?

814
01:16:09,044 --> 01:16:11,535
I've got no one else to ask

815
01:16:13,148 --> 01:16:15,514
Oh my...

816
01:16:16,518 --> 01:16:17,678
Ma'am

817
01:16:18,454 --> 01:16:20,319
Don't do this

818
01:16:22,024 --> 01:16:23,286
I know

819
01:16:23,759 --> 01:16:25,386
I do, but...

820
01:16:26,028 --> 01:16:29,054
there's no way
I can get the money

821
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:31,428
So I'm asking you

822
01:16:33,402 --> 01:16:34,926
I will pay you back

823
01:16:35,971 --> 01:16:39,065
I'll even work here

824
01:16:39,909 --> 01:16:43,436
I'll do anything

825
01:16:43,712 --> 01:16:45,270
I'm sorry, but...

826
01:16:46,181 --> 01:16:49,150
I don't have the money
to lend you

827
01:16:49,718 --> 01:16:52,881
And there's no job for
you at a karaoke

828
01:16:52,988 --> 01:16:55,081
Then what shall I do?

829
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:58,286
I'll have to rob a bank, then

830
01:16:58,427 --> 01:17:00,395
Talk to Wook's mom

831
01:17:00,496 --> 01:17:02,088
Why won't you tell her?

832
01:17:02,331 --> 01:17:04,629
You said you talked about
everything with her...

833
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:06,596
and that you were
friends forever

834
01:17:09,305 --> 01:17:12,206
I go to a Catholic church

835
01:17:12,975 --> 01:17:16,308
And our church is quite
old and beautiful

836
01:17:17,446 --> 01:17:19,710
In the front yard at springtime,

837
01:17:20,382 --> 01:17:21,940
buds...

838
01:17:22,618 --> 01:17:24,916
that spring from the branches...

839
01:17:25,287 --> 01:17:27,084
are a grass green color...

840
01:17:28,057 --> 01:17:30,116
which looks so sad

841
01:17:30,326 --> 01:17:32,760
It's so pretty that it looks sad

842
01:17:32,895 --> 01:17:38,026
So I would brush my hand
over the buds...

843
01:17:38,801 --> 01:17:42,032
saying, "how pretty you are"

844
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:46,431
They say it's a sign that
I'm getting older

845
01:17:48,010 --> 01:17:51,844
I might get sick or
be in agony, but...

846
01:17:51,914 --> 01:17:53,211
I'm happy

847
01:17:53,315 --> 01:17:54,942
I am happy

848
01:17:56,352 --> 01:18:00,288
Now I am in love

849
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:03,722
But it's so beautiful...

850
01:18:04,426 --> 01:18:05,825
and painful

851
01:18:07,029 --> 01:18:13,264
It's painful because it's love
that cannot be

852
01:18:13,936 --> 01:18:18,566
He's married like me

853
01:18:19,308 --> 01:18:24,336
I always thought I despised him

854
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:27,180
He really has a bad temper

855
01:18:28,217 --> 01:18:33,280
But one day, we were
leaving from a night shift...

856
01:18:33,422 --> 01:18:38,553
and ended up sleeping together

857
01:18:38,927 --> 01:18:41,521
It just happened once, but...

858
01:18:42,364 --> 01:18:49,361
I couldn't erase that memory

859
01:18:49,671 --> 01:18:53,437
The more I tried, the more
it reminded me of him

860
01:18:54,943 --> 01:18:57,878
If only he hadn't been
in my sight

861
01:18:58,814 --> 01:19:02,272
They say, 'out of sight,
out of mind'

862
01:19:02,851 --> 01:19:06,582
But he wasn't intended
to be out of my sight

863
01:19:08,424 --> 01:19:12,724
I cried and laughed like crazy

864
01:19:15,564 --> 01:19:21,901
But the suffering is
driving me to death

865
01:19:24,039 --> 01:19:28,635
But even the suffering
is beautiful

866
01:19:30,779 --> 01:19:34,510
I recall a moment when
I was very young

867
01:19:35,651 --> 01:19:41,783
It might be the very
first memory of mine

868
01:19:43,392 --> 01:19:48,625
I was too young to
remember how old I was

869
01:19:49,565 --> 01:19:50,862
Three?

870
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,697
Maybe four?

871
01:19:53,435 --> 01:19:55,562
I guess mom was sick

872
01:19:55,904 --> 01:19:59,340
So my older sister
was taking care of me

873
01:20:00,609 --> 01:20:05,569
We're seven years apart

874
01:20:07,816 --> 01:20:10,512
In the living room,

875
01:20:11,553 --> 01:20:14,249
the red curtains are
drawn closed

876
01:20:17,126 --> 01:20:20,289
But through a slight opening,

877
01:20:20,696 --> 01:20:23,631
the sunlight is seeping in

878
01:20:26,702 --> 01:20:29,865
Now I can see half
of my sister's face

879
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:35,376
The other half is hidden
in the shadows

880
01:20:35,477 --> 01:20:39,277
I think she dressed
me in pretty clothes

881
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:45,442
"Mija, come here. Come here"

882
01:20:46,054 --> 01:20:48,420
She is saying, clapping
her hands

883
01:20:49,057 --> 01:20:51,855
I am tottering to her

884
01:20:52,261 --> 01:20:56,664
Although I was so little,
I knew my sister loved me...

885
01:20:57,266 --> 01:20:59,393
as she told me to come to her

886
01:20:59,568 --> 01:21:02,162
I felt so good

887
01:21:03,805 --> 01:21:05,602
And so happy

888
01:21:07,176 --> 01:21:09,303
'I am really pretty'...

889
01:21:09,578 --> 01:21:11,603
was how I felt

890
01:21:13,182 --> 01:21:15,275
"Mija, come here"

891
01:21:16,118 --> 01:21:18,382
"Hurry over here, Mija"

892
01:25:23,231 --> 01:25:25,165
Thank you

893
01:25:29,871 --> 01:25:33,034
What brings you here?
You're all wet from the rain

894
01:25:34,142 --> 01:25:36,133
Give me the keys
to the 3rd floor

895
01:25:36,311 --> 01:25:37,573
Are you coming back to work?

896
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:41,039
What changed your mind?

897
01:25:41,249 --> 01:25:44,150
I thought you'd never come back

898
01:26:26,561 --> 01:26:28,324
What are you looking for?

899
01:26:51,887 --> 01:26:53,184
Take this

900
01:26:57,225 --> 01:26:58,249
Now

901
01:30:12,153 --> 01:30:14,018
Ah, here she comes

902
01:30:14,889 --> 01:30:16,186
- Thank you
- You're welcome

903
01:30:19,461 --> 01:30:21,691
Well hello, ma'am!

904
01:30:23,031 --> 01:30:24,396
Yes, hello

905
01:30:24,499 --> 01:30:26,763
You're Wook's grandma, right?

906
01:30:27,168 --> 01:30:30,001
Yes. And who are you?

907
01:30:30,338 --> 01:30:34,331
I write for the 'Kyungkang Times'

908
01:30:34,442 --> 01:30:36,706
It must be hard for you
these days, right?

909
01:30:36,911 --> 01:30:39,175
Well, it's okay

910
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:40,577
Let's see

911
01:30:41,116 --> 01:30:43,050
Why don't we sit over here

912
01:30:47,889 --> 01:30:50,983
You look amazing, ma'am

913
01:30:52,994 --> 01:30:55,485
How nice of you

914
01:30:56,097 --> 01:31:00,898
How are the settlements going?

915
01:31:01,035 --> 01:31:03,060
Not that great, I guess

916
01:31:03,171 --> 01:31:04,297
How come?

917
01:31:04,672 --> 01:31:08,369
Is the victim's side refusing
your amount?

918
01:31:08,543 --> 01:31:12,206
I don't know for sure, but...

919
01:31:12,547 --> 01:31:16,347
the girl's mom doesn't
want to settle, I guess

920
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:18,885
I see, the girl's mom...

921
01:31:19,621 --> 01:31:24,581
With a case like that, it's
usually money problems

922
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,695
But are there reasons
other than money?

923
01:31:29,197 --> 01:31:32,098
- I don't know, but...
- Yes?

924
01:31:35,703 --> 01:31:36,727
What's wrong?

925
01:31:36,838 --> 01:31:37,862
No, I can't...

926
01:31:37,972 --> 01:31:38,996
You can't, what?

927
01:31:39,307 --> 01:31:40,399
What's the matter?

928
01:31:40,475 --> 01:31:41,965
Please sit for a moment, ma'am

929
01:31:42,076 --> 01:31:43,043
No!

930
01:31:43,111 --> 01:31:46,274
I just have a few more
questions. Wait!

931
01:32:02,297 --> 01:32:07,064
'We're trying to settle
with the girl's mom,

932
01:32:07,168 --> 01:32:09,261
but she's refusing'
Is that what you said?

933
01:32:11,139 --> 01:32:13,369
I don't fucking believe this

934
01:32:14,175 --> 01:32:17,269
Didn't we tell you to
watch your mouth?

935
01:32:17,345 --> 01:32:20,508
That guy from finally got his tip...

936
01:32:21,082 --> 01:32:24,313
after sniffing out the school and
police station almost every day

937
01:32:24,385 --> 01:32:27,548
She didn't say anything
specific yet

938
01:32:28,289 --> 01:32:30,621
But it's never late to move now

939
01:32:30,725 --> 01:32:34,525
If only the girl's mom keeps
quiet, we'll be okay

940
01:32:34,696 --> 01:32:36,186
There's not much time

941
01:32:38,099 --> 01:32:39,794
Come later, okay?

942
01:32:39,901 --> 01:32:41,698
I'm in an important meeting

943
01:32:47,809 --> 01:32:51,404
How about meeting
the girl's mom yourself?

944
01:32:51,546 --> 01:32:54,913
- Who me?
- Yes

945
01:32:55,016 --> 01:32:58,918
You go meet and persuade
the girl's mom

946
01:32:59,287 --> 01:33:03,815
What could I say to her?

947
01:33:03,958 --> 01:33:06,256
I can't do it

948
01:33:06,361 --> 01:33:09,057
Just plead with her
heart-to-heart

949
01:33:09,130 --> 01:33:10,563
Woman-to-woman

950
01:33:11,132 --> 01:33:15,159
You can be better than us

951
01:33:15,270 --> 01:33:17,101
Right, sounds like a plan

952
01:33:17,605 --> 01:33:21,939
A poor old lady, raising
her grandson alone pleads...

953
01:33:22,043 --> 01:33:23,442
woman-to-woman

954
01:33:23,544 --> 01:33:25,671
Shedding a little tears

955
01:33:25,813 --> 01:33:26,871
Yes, let's do that

956
01:33:27,215 --> 01:33:28,375
Ma'am

957
01:33:29,484 --> 01:33:33,420
Meet her immediately
I'll drive you there, tomorrow

958
01:33:56,010 --> 01:33:57,944
Call me when you're done
I'll come to pick you up

959
01:33:58,012 --> 01:34:02,210
I'll take the bus. There
I see a bus stop

960
01:34:05,153 --> 01:34:06,916
I can get home by myself

961
01:34:06,988 --> 01:34:09,752
Anyway, call me if you need a
ride. Do a good job

962
01:34:09,824 --> 01:34:12,292
Everything depends on you now
You do understand?

963
01:34:14,062 --> 01:34:15,120
Yes

964
01:34:30,011 --> 01:34:31,808
Your outfit stands out too much

965
01:34:31,879 --> 01:34:34,177
It really doesn't fit in with
the neighborhood

966
01:34:34,816 --> 01:34:37,250
Then what should I do?
Should I go back?

967
01:34:37,952 --> 01:34:40,284
I can come again in
different clothes

968
01:34:40,388 --> 01:34:42,652
You can't just leave now

969
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:44,587
Your words hold the key

970
01:34:44,659 --> 01:34:47,253
Don't say anything
to upset her, okay?

971
01:34:47,328 --> 01:34:49,159
You grasp the situation, right?

972
01:34:49,564 --> 01:34:51,361
I'll try

973
01:35:11,919 --> 01:35:13,318
Excuse me

974
01:35:17,859 --> 01:35:19,486
Is anyone there?

975
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,355
Where did everyone go?

976
01:36:39,874 --> 01:36:41,535
Are you here for someone?

977
01:36:44,278 --> 01:36:48,681
I guess everyone's out?

978
01:36:49,183 --> 01:36:52,880
The gate was open so I invited
myself in, but no one's here

979
01:36:52,987 --> 01:36:57,447
The mom's out in the fields
What brings you here?

980
01:36:57,892 --> 01:37:01,953
I have to talk to her

981
01:37:02,563 --> 01:37:04,724
She'll be back around sunset

982
01:37:04,866 --> 01:37:07,562
Why don't you go to
the fields to find her

983
01:37:08,169 --> 01:37:09,932
Where's that?

984
01:37:10,271 --> 01:37:13,001
Over there you'll find
a plastic greenhouse

985
01:37:13,074 --> 01:37:17,738
Go past it and there's a field
near a brook. She'll be there

986
01:37:40,735 --> 01:37:43,397
How fussy you are

987
01:38:29,383 --> 01:38:32,253
THE APRICOT THROWS ITSELF
TO THE GROUND

988
01:38:32,253 --> 01:38:35,245
IT IS CRUSHED AND TRAMPLED
FOR ITS NEXT LIFE

989
01:38:54,709 --> 01:38:56,074
Hello

990
01:38:57,478 --> 01:38:59,002
Yes, hello

991
01:39:00,248 --> 01:39:02,182
Isn't the weather nice?

992
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:04,878
Yes, the weather's being helpful

993
01:39:06,087 --> 01:39:10,581
This place is quite nice
The scenery is so beautiful

994
01:39:11,659 --> 01:39:14,389
It makes me want to live here

995
01:39:14,462 --> 01:39:17,431
It's not an easy place
to live though

996
01:39:18,933 --> 01:39:21,493
I found an apricot
on my way here

997
01:39:22,036 --> 01:39:24,630
Many have fallen to the ground

998
01:39:25,706 --> 01:39:28,869
I took a bite and
it tasted quite good

999
01:39:30,244 --> 01:39:32,735
Fallen apricots have
a better taste

1000
01:39:32,813 --> 01:39:34,713
The one still on trees
are too puckery to eat

1001
01:39:34,815 --> 01:39:37,181
Yes, you're right

1002
01:39:37,418 --> 01:39:38,885
It tasted good

1003
01:39:39,153 --> 01:39:41,678
When I saw the apricots
on the ground,

1004
01:39:41,789 --> 01:39:44,349
I thought they were
full of yearning

1005
01:39:44,525 --> 01:39:46,516
Throwing themselves
to the ground...

1006
01:39:46,594 --> 01:39:48,858
be crushed and trampled on,

1007
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:51,260
they prepare for their next life

1008
01:39:52,466 --> 01:39:57,369
For the first time, I realized
this about apricots

1009
01:39:59,674 --> 01:40:02,666
There were also garden zinnias
growing near the apricot trees

1010
01:40:02,743 --> 01:40:05,712
And how pretty they
fall to the ground

1011
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:11,416
I felt so blessed to
walk in such beauty

1012
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:17,150
I love flowers so much, I get
happy just to see them

1013
01:40:18,125 --> 01:40:21,526
Gazing at flowers
makes me feel full...

1014
01:40:22,530 --> 01:40:24,589
that I don't even need to eat

1015
01:40:25,099 --> 01:40:27,932
You must like flowers
cause you're pretty

1016
01:40:28,202 --> 01:40:30,193
You think I'm pretty?

1017
01:40:30,271 --> 01:40:32,034
Why thank you

1018
01:40:33,774 --> 01:40:36,174
I do like to dress up a bit

1019
01:40:38,179 --> 01:40:40,409
How's the crop coming along
this year?

1020
01:40:40,948 --> 01:40:42,779
It's so so

1021
01:40:44,018 --> 01:40:47,647
I hope it's a good harvest,
so you'll earn a lot

1022
01:40:48,356 --> 01:40:50,824
Prices will drop on a good year,

1023
01:40:50,925 --> 01:40:52,916
while it's as tough on a bad year

1024
01:40:53,127 --> 01:40:54,617
Nothing's easy, you know?

1025
01:40:54,695 --> 01:40:56,390
Yes, but...

1026
01:40:56,931 --> 01:40:58,922
I hope everything goes well

1027
01:41:01,068 --> 01:41:02,194
Then...

1028
01:41:03,037 --> 01:41:04,402
have a good day

1029
01:41:04,772 --> 01:41:06,672
- Yes, goodbye
- Bye

1030
01:42:10,571 --> 01:42:11,765
Well...

1031
01:42:12,006 --> 01:42:13,200
I...

1032
01:42:13,707 --> 01:42:15,265
couldn't meet her

1033
01:42:16,010 --> 01:42:18,001
No one was home

1034
01:42:18,979 --> 01:42:21,504
So I left after waiting
for a while

1035
01:42:22,216 --> 01:42:23,513
I'm sorry

1036
01:42:24,752 --> 01:42:25,912
Excuse me?

1037
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:27,587
I'm sorry because...

1038
01:42:27,888 --> 01:42:31,725
I just returned without
meeting her

1039
01:42:34,862 --> 01:42:36,329
Die...

1040
01:42:36,530 --> 01:42:37,963
as you love

1041
01:42:38,732 --> 01:42:41,599
To the point that the Vairocana
Buddha...

1042
01:42:41,702 --> 01:42:43,397
hangs suspended...

1043
01:42:43,504 --> 01:42:45,472
by a finger

1044
01:42:46,474 --> 01:42:49,102
Die as you wait

1045
01:42:50,010 --> 01:42:53,639
To the point that
the Amitabha Buddha...

1046
01:42:53,714 --> 01:42:55,978
severs its head
to use as a pillow

1047
01:42:56,116 --> 01:42:57,845
Until dawn passes...

1048
01:42:57,952 --> 01:43:00,750
the iron bell for
offerings to Buddha...

1049
01:43:00,821 --> 01:43:02,482
does not ring

1050
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:05,955
I sit by the columns of
Buseok Temple...

1051
01:43:06,026 --> 01:43:07,926
throughout my life

1052
01:43:08,062 --> 01:43:12,522
Unable to offer you even
one bowl of rice

1053
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:17,137
But within a tear, I build a
temple and then tear it down

1054
01:43:17,571 --> 01:43:21,871
Above a rock hanging in the sky,
I build a temple

1055
01:43:26,881 --> 01:43:28,644
'Die as you Love'

1056
01:43:28,716 --> 01:43:32,482
Yes, I'd like to die as I love

1057
01:43:32,853 --> 01:43:34,878
It's a poem that
hits you strong...

1058
01:43:34,989 --> 01:43:37,287
like when you take
a cold shower

1059
01:43:37,358 --> 01:43:38,382
Next is...

1060
01:43:38,492 --> 01:43:42,258
Mr. PARK Sangtae who will
read AHN Dohyun's poem

1061
01:43:45,399 --> 01:43:47,390
I ask you

1062
01:43:48,636 --> 01:43:50,126
This is the title of the poem

1063
01:43:53,340 --> 01:43:58,539
Do not even dare kick at
the ashes of burnt coal

1064
01:44:00,147 --> 01:44:02,843
Have you ever been...

1065
01:44:03,117 --> 01:44:05,813
a burning person to another?

1066
01:44:07,588 --> 01:44:08,782
That's the end

1067
01:44:10,057 --> 01:44:11,991
It's a good poem
cause it's short

1068
01:44:12,526 --> 01:44:15,689
The emcee mentioned shower

1069
01:44:15,763 --> 01:44:18,493
The recent heat wave makes you
shower everyday, right?

1070
01:44:19,366 --> 01:44:23,666
Well I did some research
on showers

1071
01:44:25,372 --> 01:44:28,375
Do you know the
5 stages of showering?

1072
01:44:28,375 --> 01:44:29,273
No

1073
01:44:29,376 --> 01:44:30,502
You don't?

1074
01:44:30,878 --> 01:44:32,539
The five stages are...

1075
01:44:33,213 --> 01:44:34,475
Stage 1

1076
01:44:34,582 --> 01:44:35,640
Take shower!

1077
01:44:37,418 --> 01:44:38,646
Stage 2

1078
01:44:39,720 --> 01:44:40,914
Spread-eagle!

1079
01:44:42,323 --> 01:44:43,483
Stage 3

1080
01:44:44,158 --> 01:44:45,182
Get boner!

1081
01:44:46,894 --> 01:44:48,156
Next is...

1082
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:49,954
Plug into!

1083
01:44:52,399 --> 01:44:54,526
And last but not least...

1084
01:44:54,602 --> 01:44:56,263
Oh, thank, yer!

1085
01:44:58,539 --> 01:44:59,904
Thank you very much

1086
01:45:00,608 --> 01:45:04,704
Good health requires occasional
physical stimulation

1087
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:09,106
I'm out of the hospital
and back at work

1088
01:45:09,883 --> 01:45:12,545
If you every visit
the police station,

1089
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:14,087
please stop by to see me

1090
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:22,927
So he works at
the police station?

1091
01:45:24,098 --> 01:45:26,089
Yes he does
Pretty funny, isn't he?

1092
01:45:27,234 --> 01:45:29,998
We're here to love poetry

1093
01:45:30,337 --> 01:45:33,773
To love poetry is to seek
beauty, right?

1094
01:45:34,008 --> 01:45:36,772
But he's always
talking dirty like that

1095
01:45:37,645 --> 01:45:40,409
It's like he's insulting poetry

1096
01:45:41,782 --> 01:45:44,444
He actually has a good heart

1097
01:45:44,785 --> 01:45:47,049
He used to work at the Seoul
Police Station,

1098
01:45:47,121 --> 01:45:50,318
but after reporting
internal corruption,

1099
01:45:50,391 --> 01:45:52,586
he was demoted to this
country police station

1100
01:45:52,693 --> 01:45:53,921
Really?

1101
01:45:54,695 --> 01:45:57,459
It doesn't look like that

1102
01:46:21,121 --> 01:46:22,247
Mr. PARK!

1103
01:46:23,557 --> 01:46:26,151
- Mr. PARK!
- Yes, yes, yes

1104
01:46:27,528 --> 01:46:29,359
- This lady...
- Yes?

1105
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:31,921
She says you're insulting poetry

1106
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:38,970
How come our chic
big sister thinks that?

1107
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:43,203
To recite poetry is
to love it, right?

1108
01:46:43,277 --> 01:46:44,403
So?

1109
01:46:44,745 --> 01:46:47,407
To love poetry is...

1110
01:46:47,481 --> 01:46:49,915
seeking true beauty

1111
01:46:50,084 --> 01:46:54,487
True beauty... That's
a tough one for me

1112
01:46:54,588 --> 01:46:56,078
I'm not that intelligent,
you know

1113
01:46:56,190 --> 01:46:57,452
Anyway, go on

1114
01:46:57,624 --> 01:47:00,024
At a place you're supposed
to seek beauty,

1115
01:47:00,127 --> 01:47:01,822
she says you're always...

1116
01:47:02,429 --> 01:47:04,897
talking dirty

1117
01:47:06,333 --> 01:47:08,198
Sorry, big sister!

1118
01:47:09,136 --> 01:47:12,299
I apologize for insulting poetry

1119
01:47:12,940 --> 01:47:14,271
I promise to repent

1120
01:47:14,341 --> 01:47:16,901
And to show you I will,
let me pour you a glass

1121
01:47:18,612 --> 01:47:20,239
I can't drink

1122
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:21,711
Just one glass

1123
01:47:21,782 --> 01:47:26,378
They say you should drink or
fall in love to write poetry

1124
01:47:31,458 --> 01:47:33,153
Attention everyone!

1125
01:47:33,827 --> 01:47:34,851
You all know...

1126
01:47:35,329 --> 01:47:36,887
the poet, KIM Yongtak, right?

1127
01:47:36,964 --> 01:47:38,363
- Yes
- Good evening

1128
01:47:38,465 --> 01:47:42,799
I saw him drinking in the other
room and dragged him over

1129
01:47:45,639 --> 01:47:46,833
Greetings!

1130
01:47:47,574 --> 01:47:49,974
Actually I wasn't dragged here

1131
01:47:50,377 --> 01:47:53,369
I heard our 'Love Poetry'
members were here,

1132
01:47:53,447 --> 01:47:55,506
so I volunteered to
drop by and say hello

1133
01:47:55,883 --> 01:47:58,977
I was here with my young
poet friends for a drink

1134
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:01,349
This man next to me...

1135
01:48:01,722 --> 01:48:03,519
is the poet, HWANG Myungseung

1136
01:48:09,863 --> 01:48:11,990
- Please join us for a drink
- Okay

1137
01:48:12,399 --> 01:48:14,060
- Join us as well
- Okay

1138
01:48:14,168 --> 01:48:16,796
Good evening, sir

1139
01:48:16,870 --> 01:48:19,805
Uh? Are you also
a member of this group?

1140
01:48:20,007 --> 01:48:22,237
No, I'm not

1141
01:48:22,442 --> 01:48:25,934
But I came to the reading
and ended up here

1142
01:48:26,046 --> 01:48:29,243
Anyway, in an era when
poetry is dying away,

1143
01:48:29,449 --> 01:48:32,680
I am so thankful and happy
that there are people like you...

1144
01:48:32,753 --> 01:48:34,516
who love poetry

1145
01:48:35,155 --> 01:48:36,850
- Sir
- Yes?

1146
01:48:37,191 --> 01:48:39,421
Why are you saying
poetry is dying away?

1147
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:41,892
But it is. Unfortunately,

1148
01:48:42,129 --> 01:48:46,031
the day will come when
people no longer read...

1149
01:48:46,466 --> 01:48:47,956
or write poetry anymore

1150
01:48:48,035 --> 01:48:50,697
Poetry deserves to die!

1151
01:48:50,904 --> 01:48:55,603
He's still young, but he's a
poet with superb sensibility

1152
01:48:55,876 --> 01:48:58,367
This year, he was nominated for
the Sowol Literature Awards

1153
01:48:58,579 --> 01:49:00,342
And his poems are
quite provocative

1154
01:49:00,714 --> 01:49:04,810
'The color of the sky,
like a cat dead for a month'

1155
01:49:04,918 --> 01:49:06,579
Verses like this

1156
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:08,080
Sir

1157
01:49:08,555 --> 01:49:10,887
How can I write poetry?

1158
01:49:13,026 --> 01:49:14,516
It's difficult, isn't it?

1159
01:49:14,595 --> 01:49:15,994
To write poetry

1160
01:49:16,129 --> 01:49:17,596
It is so difficult

1161
01:49:18,232 --> 01:49:20,097
As hard as I try,

1162
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:22,860
I can't seem to write poetry

1163
01:49:23,604 --> 01:49:26,266
How can I write poetry?

1164
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:29,736
You said in your class...

1165
01:49:29,977 --> 01:49:33,174
that we all carry poetry
in our heart...

1166
01:49:33,513 --> 01:49:35,504
And that the poetry
trapped inside...

1167
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:38,414
should get their wings
and fly away

1168
01:49:40,954 --> 01:49:43,081
Did you really say that?

1169
01:49:43,590 --> 01:49:46,650
Wow, bravo!

1170
01:49:50,063 --> 01:49:53,499
To welcome the two poets here,

1171
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:55,465
I'd like to dedicate a song

1172
01:50:42,983 --> 01:50:45,281
What are you doing here
alone, big sister?

1173
01:50:48,455 --> 01:50:49,615
Are you okay?

1174
01:50:51,391 --> 01:50:52,449
Are you drunk?

1175
01:51:10,644 --> 01:51:12,578
Why are you crying, big sister?

1176
01:51:12,779 --> 01:51:14,440
Is something wrong?

1177
01:51:18,585 --> 01:51:20,246
Is it because of poetry?

1178
01:51:20,487 --> 01:51:21,977
Because you can't write any?

1179
01:53:12,365 --> 01:53:14,356
What's got into you?
On a Sunday?

1180
01:53:15,635 --> 01:53:17,626
I thought you'd be
sleeping all day

1181
01:53:36,690 --> 01:53:38,590
Gimme something to eat
I'm hungry.

1182
01:54:17,430 --> 01:54:19,591
Swirl it, swirl

1183
01:54:41,388 --> 01:54:42,878
I swirl pretty well, don't I?

1184
01:54:55,101 --> 01:54:56,398
Hello there

1185
01:54:56,703 --> 01:54:58,398
Wook's grandma's here

1186
01:54:58,805 --> 01:55:01,273
I see you have guests
I can come back later

1187
01:55:01,308 --> 01:55:03,003
No, please come in

1188
01:55:03,743 --> 01:55:06,837
They're people you know,
so please come in

1189
01:55:10,083 --> 01:55:10,947
Hello

1190
01:55:11,017 --> 01:55:13,417
Please say hello,
this is Heejin's mom

1191
01:55:15,822 --> 01:55:17,312
Hello

1192
01:55:17,958 --> 01:55:20,552
She is PARK Jongwook's
grandma

1193
01:55:20,961 --> 01:55:23,555
She visited your house
the other day

1194
01:55:25,365 --> 01:55:28,027
She felt so bad and sorry...

1195
01:55:28,134 --> 01:55:30,728
that she went alone
to apologize,

1196
01:55:31,004 --> 01:55:33,165
but she couldn't meet you
Isn't that right?

1197
01:55:37,811 --> 01:55:41,975
Is Heejin's brother entering
mid. School next year?

1198
01:55:42,115 --> 01:55:43,309
Yes

1199
01:55:43,850 --> 01:55:45,613
Is he getting good grades?

1200
01:55:45,685 --> 01:55:47,118
I hope he is

1201
01:55:47,854 --> 01:55:49,515
- He's so so
- I see

1202
01:55:50,790 --> 01:55:52,951
He should study hard

1203
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:56,090
Because his mom's managing
so hard on her own

1204
01:55:58,398 --> 01:56:00,161
Where are you going, ma'am?

1205
01:56:04,638 --> 01:56:05,696
Ma'am!

1206
01:56:06,673 --> 01:56:08,641
Why did you just leave?

1207
01:56:08,942 --> 01:56:11,934
Do you have the money ready?

1208
01:56:12,912 --> 01:56:14,174
Actually,

1209
01:56:14,414 --> 01:56:16,109
no

1210
01:56:16,516 --> 01:56:18,450
I came here to tell you that

1211
01:56:18,551 --> 01:56:20,109
Just in case you'd be waiting

1212
01:56:20,186 --> 01:56:21,881
Then what shall we do?

1213
01:56:23,790 --> 01:56:25,690
It's urgent

1214
01:56:26,026 --> 01:56:28,995
The talks are going well
with the girl's mom

1215
01:56:29,129 --> 01:56:31,461
It was really hard to make
her come all this way

1216
01:56:31,531 --> 01:56:34,557
That reporter helped us
arrange this meeting, okay?

1217
01:56:34,668 --> 01:56:37,501
How can you say you don't
have the money now?

1218
01:56:40,040 --> 01:56:41,837
Didn't you talk to
your daughter?

1219
01:56:42,542 --> 01:56:44,134
Not yet

1220
01:56:45,312 --> 01:56:47,780
Why not? You should have

1221
01:56:49,049 --> 01:56:52,485
Don't you understand
the situation?

1222
01:57:22,849 --> 01:57:25,647
Say, "grandpa, I love you,"
okay?

1223
01:57:25,752 --> 01:57:27,686
She's getting prettier
by the day

1224
01:57:28,121 --> 01:57:29,554
Let's see how she can kiss

1225
01:57:30,090 --> 01:57:32,115
Say, "I love you"
On the lips

1226
01:57:36,696 --> 01:57:37,720
Now, it's your turn

1227
01:57:37,797 --> 01:57:38,991
Who is it?

1228
01:57:43,903 --> 01:57:45,165
Good

1229
01:57:46,306 --> 01:57:48,536
Grandpa stinks

1230
01:57:51,511 --> 01:57:52,705
Oh, ma'am!

1231
01:57:53,246 --> 01:57:54,873
This is so sudden

1232
01:57:54,981 --> 01:57:57,006
Yes, it is so sudden, right?

1233
01:57:57,283 --> 01:57:59,683
Uh, right. What brings you here?

1234
01:57:59,919 --> 01:58:02,581
I have to talk to Mr. KANG

1235
01:58:10,764 --> 01:58:11,492
Don't!

1236
01:58:11,731 --> 01:58:13,062
Okay, don't!

1237
01:58:47,367 --> 01:58:51,030
PLEASE GIVE ME 5 MILLION WON
I BEG YOU, DON'T ASK WHY

1238
01:58:55,975 --> 01:58:59,536
I wanna say I'm borrowing
the money,

1239
01:59:00,246 --> 01:59:02,339
but I can't because it's useless

1240
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:06,013
Why should I?

1241
01:59:23,536 --> 01:59:27,063
WHY SHOULD I GIVE YOU
MONEY WITHOUT A REASON

1242
01:59:32,579 --> 01:59:35,548
So you're here to talk to
my father-in-law?

1243
01:59:35,815 --> 01:59:37,544
I guess it's something serious?

1244
01:59:38,218 --> 01:59:40,413
It's nothing serious

1245
01:59:40,687 --> 01:59:44,453
I just came for the money
he owes me

1246
01:59:44,657 --> 01:59:46,022
He owes you money?

1247
01:59:46,526 --> 01:59:47,857
What money?

1248
01:59:49,329 --> 01:59:50,421
Dad

1249
01:59:50,530 --> 01:59:52,998
Do you owe her money?

1250
02:00:23,963 --> 02:00:26,727
IS THIS BLACKMAIL?

1251
02:00:29,102 --> 02:00:31,195
It doesn't matter
whatever you think

1252
02:00:31,738 --> 02:00:33,729
I won't make any excuses

1253
02:00:40,847 --> 02:00:43,816
Yes, yes. Taeyeol's dad
said he'll be here soon

1254
02:00:43,983 --> 02:00:46,383
And Byungjin's dad
has an appointment,

1255
02:00:46,519 --> 02:00:49,147
but he'll join us an hour later

1256
02:00:49,222 --> 02:00:51,486
Yes, yes. Come in. Yes

1257
02:00:51,558 --> 02:00:52,525
Enjoy your meal

1258
02:00:59,332 --> 02:01:02,824
So you finally got the money?

1259
02:01:05,171 --> 02:01:07,401
Then I'll be on my way

1260
02:01:07,473 --> 02:01:09,703
Sit. What's the rush?

1261
02:01:18,985 --> 02:01:20,543
It's all cash

1262
02:01:21,354 --> 02:01:23,379
Did you really rob a bank?

1263
02:01:24,724 --> 02:01:28,854
- So the mom settled?
- Yes, she settled

1264
02:01:28,928 --> 02:01:32,489
Once the 30 million Won is
paid, it'll all be over

1265
02:01:32,665 --> 02:01:36,123
Since you paid your share,
NO PROBLEM!

1266
02:01:36,235 --> 02:01:37,634
Now everything's okay

1267
02:01:37,837 --> 02:01:40,499
That's why we're here for
a small celebratory drink

1268
02:01:40,673 --> 02:01:42,937
Since everyone has suffered

1269
02:01:43,977 --> 02:01:47,174
So is it all over now?

1270
02:01:48,047 --> 02:01:49,446
Totally?

1271
02:01:49,882 --> 02:01:52,180
It's hard to say it's totally over

1272
02:01:52,418 --> 02:01:55,751
If the victim's an adult,
a settlement is enough

1273
02:01:55,855 --> 02:01:57,755
But in the case of a minor,

1274
02:01:58,124 --> 02:02:00,615
if someone informs the police,
an investigation's required

1275
02:02:00,693 --> 02:02:05,460
But we cleaned up everything
with the school and the press...

1276
02:02:05,598 --> 02:02:07,896
and reached a settlement
with the girl's mom

1277
02:02:08,067 --> 02:02:10,262
So there's nothing to
worry about anymore

1278
02:02:10,970 --> 02:02:14,406
I'm sure you haven't eaten yet,
why don't you join us?

1279
02:02:14,607 --> 02:02:16,734
- I have to go
- Really?

1280
02:03:25,611 --> 02:03:26,737
What?

1281
02:03:26,879 --> 02:03:27,777
Let's go!

1282
02:03:28,114 --> 02:03:29,172
Why?

1283
02:03:34,921 --> 02:03:36,115
Good bye, ma'am

1284
02:03:47,767 --> 02:03:49,064
Enjoy your meal

1285
02:03:58,678 --> 02:03:59,838
Is it good?

1286
02:04:04,150 --> 02:04:05,447
Is it?

1287
02:04:09,288 --> 02:04:11,347
Take a bath when
you get home

1288
02:04:12,391 --> 02:04:13,415
Why?

1289
02:04:14,460 --> 02:04:15,825
Just because

1290
02:04:16,362 --> 02:04:19,388
Take a bath and cut your nails

1291
02:04:21,100 --> 02:04:24,433
Since you recently got a haircut,
you won't need one

1292
02:04:25,171 --> 02:04:27,002
You should look decent

1293
02:04:27,473 --> 02:04:29,270
And your mom's
coming tomorrow

1294
02:04:30,443 --> 02:04:32,138
Why's she coming?

1295
02:04:33,412 --> 02:04:35,972
I told her to come

1296
02:04:36,516 --> 02:04:39,178
It's been a while since
you've seen her

1297
02:04:59,205 --> 02:05:01,036
Look here

1298
02:05:01,140 --> 02:05:03,631
This part's still dirty

1299
02:05:04,410 --> 02:05:07,379
Was it too precious to clean?

1300
02:05:09,649 --> 02:05:15,849
You need to scrub the back of
your heels when you take a bath

1301
02:05:16,756 --> 02:05:19,554
Why do you even need
a scrubbing towel?

1302
02:05:19,926 --> 02:05:22,258
Is it just for fun or
to use as a pocketchief?

1303
02:05:23,462 --> 02:05:25,657
You're always like this

1304
02:05:25,898 --> 02:05:28,298
You even bathe half-heartedly!

1305
02:05:28,501 --> 02:05:30,901
Even when you wash your face,
you just pat water on...

1306
02:05:31,571 --> 02:05:33,471
like a cat

1307
02:05:33,606 --> 02:05:36,905
Why won't you scrub your
ears and neck thoroughly?

1308
02:05:37,677 --> 02:05:39,770
You should always...

1309
02:05:41,047 --> 02:05:42,981
keep your body clean

1310
02:05:43,382 --> 02:05:45,873
A clean body makes a clean mind

1311
02:06:46,612 --> 02:06:48,307
Nice shot!

1312
02:06:53,019 --> 02:06:54,111
Great!

1313
02:06:55,388 --> 02:06:56,548
Perfect!

1314
02:07:12,939 --> 02:07:14,167
- Hey, boy
- Yes?

1315
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:17,607
Come here. It's okay.

1316
02:07:28,654 --> 02:07:29,552
Big sister

1317
02:07:29,655 --> 02:07:31,748
Want me to teach you a trick?

1318
02:07:32,258 --> 02:07:34,726
Your form ain't right,
Detective PARK!

1319
02:07:34,994 --> 02:07:38,691
What's wrong with my form?
I look cool enough

1320
02:07:47,640 --> 02:07:49,369
Big sister, your serve

1321
02:07:54,513 --> 02:07:55,912
Nice shot!

1322
02:07:56,382 --> 02:07:57,576
Great!

1323
02:07:58,351 --> 02:08:00,683
Our big sister's great!

1324
02:09:44,957 --> 02:09:47,425
...trying to look cute
with your eyes like this

1325
02:09:47,993 --> 02:09:50,018
Then how should
my eyes be like?

1326
02:09:50,262 --> 02:09:51,661
They should look like this

1327
02:10:08,214 --> 02:10:10,944
Since it's the last day,

1328
02:10:11,517 --> 02:10:12,882
you've brought me flowers

1329
02:10:12,985 --> 02:10:13,952
Thank you

1330
02:10:14,687 --> 02:10:16,120
I'm touched

1331
02:10:18,124 --> 02:10:19,489
Actually

1332
02:10:19,959 --> 02:10:22,291
We didn't bring it

1333
02:10:22,394 --> 02:10:24,794
Ms. YANG Mija placed it
there and left

1334
02:10:24,897 --> 02:10:26,057
Ms. YANG Mija?

1335
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,161
She's even written a poem

1336
02:10:30,836 --> 02:10:32,428
But where has she gone?

1337
02:10:35,608 --> 02:10:38,668
Did anyone else bring a poem?

1338
02:10:39,178 --> 02:10:41,840
You were supposed to write
one poem by today

1339
02:10:42,748 --> 02:10:44,181
Anyone with a poem?

1340
02:10:46,685 --> 02:10:48,346
No one?

1341
02:10:49,622 --> 02:10:52,989
So the only one who has
written a poem is Ms. YANG

1342
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:56,352
It's too difficult

1343
02:10:56,762 --> 02:10:57,922
No it's not

1344
02:10:58,097 --> 02:11:00,190
It's not difficult to write
a poem, but

1345
02:11:00,366 --> 02:11:03,392
to have the heart to write one

1346
02:11:03,702 --> 02:11:05,260
The heart to write a poem

1347
02:11:05,371 --> 02:11:06,599
Anyway,

1348
02:11:06,839 --> 02:11:08,739
Ms. YANG is not here, but

1349
02:11:09,175 --> 02:11:12,303
let's see what kind of poem
she has written

1350
02:11:12,978 --> 02:11:15,105
I'll read it on her behalf

1351
02:11:15,981 --> 02:11:18,108
The title is, 'Agnes' Song'

1352
02:11:18,951 --> 02:11:21,579
'Agnes' Song' by YANG Mija

1353
02:11:39,638 --> 02:11:40,662
Mom...

1354
02:12:24,783 --> 02:12:27,149
<i>How is it over there?</i>

1355
02:12:28,487 --> 02:12:30,478
<i>How lonely is it?</i>

1356
02:12:33,492 --> 02:12:36,586
<i>Is it still glowing red at sunset?</i>

1357
02:12:37,696 --> 02:12:41,792
<i>Are the birds still singing on</i>
<i>the way to the forest?</i>

1358
02:12:45,170 --> 02:12:50,836
<i>Can you receive</i>
<i>the letter I dared not send?</i>

1359
02:12:53,412 --> 02:12:55,710
<i>Can I convey...</i>

1360
02:12:56,048 --> 02:12:58,448
<i>the confession I dared not make?</i>

1361
02:12:59,351 --> 02:13:03,378
<i>Will time pass and roses fade?</i>

1362
02:13:05,257 --> 02:13:07,748
<i>Now it's time to say goodbye</i>

1363
02:13:09,094 --> 02:13:11,892
<i>Like the wind that lingers</i>
<i>and then goes,</i>

1364
02:13:12,698 --> 02:13:14,359
<i>just like shadows</i>

1365
02:13:16,201 --> 02:13:18,692
<i>To promises that never came,</i>

1366
02:13:19,738 --> 02:13:22,707
<i>to the love sealed till the end</i>

1367
02:13:24,710 --> 02:13:29,010
<i>To the grass kissing</i>
<i>my weary ankles</i>

1368
02:13:31,150 --> 02:13:34,586
<i>And to the tiny footsteps</i>
<i>following me</i>

1369
02:13:42,161 --> 02:13:43,958
<i>It's time to say goodbye</i>

1370
02:13:47,232 --> 02:13:49,700
<i>Now as darkness falls</i>

1371
02:13:49,902 --> 02:13:52,427
<i>Will a candle be lit again?</i>

1372
02:13:55,107 --> 02:13:57,598
<i>Here I pray...</i>

1373
02:13:58,577 --> 02:14:01,842
<i>nobody shall cry...</i>

1374
02:14:04,283 --> 02:14:07,616
<i>and for you to know...</i>

1375
02:14:08,887 --> 02:14:11,014
<i>how deeply I loved you</i>

1376
02:14:16,662 --> 02:14:20,257
<i>The long wait in the middle</i>
<i>of a hot summer day</i>

1377
02:14:21,967 --> 02:14:25,869
<i>An old path resembling</i>
<i>my father's face</i>

1378
02:14:28,040 --> 02:14:32,670
<i>Even the lonesome wild flower</i>
<i>shyly turning away</i>

1379
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:37,376
<i>How deeply I loved</i>

1380
02:14:40,018 --> 02:14:46,446
<i>How my heart fluttered at</i>
<i>hearing your faint song</i>

1381
02:14:49,995 --> 02:14:53,055
<i>I bless you</i>

1382
02:15:00,272 --> 02:15:02,763
<i>Before crossing the black river</i>

1383
02:15:03,242 --> 02:15:06,109
<i>With my soul's last breath</i>

1384
02:15:10,048 --> 02:15:12,812
<i>I am beginning to dream...</i>

1385
02:15:14,920 --> 02:15:17,821
<i>a bright sunny morning...</i>

1386
02:15:18,690 --> 02:15:21,591
<i>again I awake,</i>
<i>blinded by the light...</i>

1387
02:15:22,361 --> 02:15:24,625
<i>and meet you...</i>

1388
02:15:25,831 --> 02:15:28,299
<i>standing by me</i>
