1
00:00:02,567 --> 00:00:03,786
Be strong.

2
00:01:18,904 --> 00:01:22,038
You can do this.
Everyone's counting on you.

3
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:31,830
Hello. You could knock, thanks.

4
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:33,919
Dad wants you downstairs...

5
00:01:33,963 --> 00:01:35,965
Hey, wait a second.
Are those my socks?

6
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:37,923
- What? We have the same ones.
- No.

7
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:39,621
Yours are the purple ones,
mine are the pink,

8
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:41,318
so, you better
take them off now, Talia...

9
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:42,798
- Skank.
- Bitch.

10
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:43,712
Hey, you know what?

11
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:45,888
- Mom!
- Oh, and you know what?

12
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:47,672
You are never borrowing
my car again because...

13
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:49,132
- I don't wanna borrow your stupid car.
- ...the last time you did,

14
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:50,612
you and your friends
left potato chips...

15
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:51,526
- I don't eat potato chips!
- ...all over the back of it,

16
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:53,156
not to mention no gas in my car.

17
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,115
Dad, gave you a gas card Jazz!
Oh, you know what?

18
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:56,855
Not all of us rely on dad.

19
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:58,553
- Are you done?
- No!

20
00:01:58,596 --> 00:02:00,404
Actually, there's quite a lot
more that I could say.

21
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:02,122
Girls, good morning.

22
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:04,472
Yeah, it was a good morning till
Jazz came bursting in my room

23
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:06,169
bitching about everything.

24
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:08,040
Jazz, lighten up!

25
00:02:08,084 --> 00:02:09,912
- Thank you, Mom.
- Oh, really?

26
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:13,089
I don't wanna hear impossible.
I wanna hear "I'm Possible".

27
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,700
And I don't care
about your kid's ball game,

28
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:18,050
your poker tournament,
or your sister's ass.

29
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:21,837
The only reason for you being
on the face of this planet today

30
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,187
is to be in Dallas at 2:00.

31
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:27,582
Get the contract signed
and keep your job.

32
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,346
- You got it?
- I understand that, Mr. Medici, but...

33
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:30,193
Good.

34
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:36,852
Okay. You're right. Yeah. No,
I'll... I'll get it done today. I'm sorry.

35
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:38,419
- You're right, sir.
- Okay.

36
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,691
I haven't heard from you all week.

37
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:53,216
Can you take about 4 minutes
and get me caught up to speed

38
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,957
on what's been going on
in your life.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,047
4 minutes to explain
the last 168 hours?

40
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:00,310
Okay.

41
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:04,184
Well, let's see.

42
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:09,450
Short version, Leah and I bought
tickets to see a Broadway show.

43
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:12,017
Oh, and I got new speakers
for my car

44
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:13,845
and they sound like,
totally awesome.

45
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:17,545
Oh, and I won. I won a free month
of tanning at the Golden Spas.

46
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:19,353
You know those, like,
little raffle ticket things

47
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:21,026
they have next
to the cash register?

48
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:26,118
Listen to yourself! I'm not
interested in any of that trivial crap.

49
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:28,860
Can you tell me something
about your future, your career,

50
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:30,993
something that I would be
interested in.

51
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:32,081
Yeah.

52
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:36,825
I've been doing really good
in my studies.

53
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:39,871
I aced my exam on Tuesday.

54
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:44,876
And, today is cheer tryouts.

55
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,316
So, I'm recruiting new members and I'm
getting ready for the competitions next week.

56
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:52,232
Well, it's very important
that you win those competitions.

57
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,408
- You know, those competitions...
- Yes, Daddy. I know!

58
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:58,412
My mother's a state champ. My sisters are
state champs. I have a lot to live up to.

59
00:03:58,455 --> 00:04:01,850
- You've told me every day since I was 5.
- Well then, good.

60
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:03,504
You know what's expected of you.

61
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:09,684
Why does everyone
have to be so powerful?

62
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:14,341
Can't we just like, I don't know,
be what we want to be?

63
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:17,866
Well sure, if what you wanna be
is #1 then yes.

64
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:22,697
- Well, we did place at prelims.
- "Place"?

65
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,743
- Yeah.
- What do you mean, "place"?

66
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:27,789
Do you even know
what the word means?

67
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:31,053
Place is an undescribed area.

68
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:35,057
I mean, if my firm placed
on every case we took on,

69
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,407
you and your mother would be
buying clothes off the rack.

70
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:42,673
I mean, just using one wrong word
can lead a client to jail

71
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:44,849
and change their life forever.

72
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:47,722
You really need to understand
what words mean.

73
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:51,029
- Second place.
- I'm sorry?

74
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:55,991
I said, we got second place.

75
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:00,038
You're really not listening
to what I'm saying, are you?

76
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:02,302
Second place is first loser.

77
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:04,608
Sweetie, I... got to go.

78
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,786
And can you kill that lipstick?
It makes you look like a hooker.

79
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:34,377
What?

80
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:35,770
You know what!

81
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,251
Calling your daughter a hooker,
Gio? Come on.

82
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:41,210
I mean,
she's probably in there crying.

83
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:43,299
I'm the one that should be crying.

84
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,346
I mean, c'mon,
what do you want me to do?

85
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:51,176
I didn't call her a hooker,
I said she looked like one.

86
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,656
It's the same difference.

87
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:55,137
A hooker wearing my socks no less.

88
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,880
You know if she touches my stuff again,
Dad, you need to take away her car,

89
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:02,492
or better yet you need to take away
her credit card 'cuz heaven forbid,

90
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:04,233
she can't buy a new outfit
every two weeks.

91
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:07,018
Okay. Love you.

92
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:08,542
Mother...

93
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:14,722
And who cares
if she doesn't win state?

94
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:18,421
I mean, there is no need for her to
feel like she let the whole family down.

95
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,424
Let's assume you're right.
Let me ask you a question.

96
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:23,295
Don't give me
that lawyer bullshit, Gio.

97
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,385
We're not in a court room,
we're in my kitchen.

98
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:31,478
Don't be like your father, Gio.

99
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:35,482
That was different, and we agreed
never to bring that up again, Priscilla.

100
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:37,484
No, it's not different.

101
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:41,879
Don't you see? You are treating her
exactly the way your father treated you.

102
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:46,144
I'm not about to spend 24 months
with a shrink her like I did with you.

103
00:06:47,058 --> 00:06:51,280
Look, I'm sorry
but you have got to back off.

104
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:57,721
You know the number one reason
why most men die before their wives?

105
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,550
They want to.

106
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:03,118
Yeah. And the number 2 reason?

107
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:05,163
Poison in the coffee.

108
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:09,429
Have a good day.

109
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,312
Did you wanna see me?

110
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:33,148
That's six complaints
from parents, Mitch.

111
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:36,281
Two letters from the board,

112
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:40,285
and as the principal, I am being held
accountable for all of it and I don't like it.

113
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:42,505
And?

114
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:44,942
And... we've been over this!

115
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:46,944
That's enough.

116
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:51,340
No more derogatory name calling
to these students.

117
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:55,039
You cannot be
calling them pussies and faggots

118
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,650
or anything else for that matter.

119
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,262
And just so that we don't have
this conversation again,

120
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:04,222
from now on, you will address
each student by their jersey number.

121
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:06,355
Not their name, their number.

122
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:08,966
Not their nickname, their number.

123
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:11,186
Understood?

124
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:14,319
All this because I called some boys
that are one year removed

125
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:16,278
from fighting
for this country a name?

126
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:18,802
This ain't the military.
They can quit.

127
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:19,934
No, Mitch.

128
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:22,023
It's more than that, okay?

129
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:25,505
It's forcing them to workout
and then playing them hurt,

130
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:29,030
and then calling them babies or
mommy's boys when they don't want to.

131
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:31,815
Look, I know you're not
physically beating on these kids

132
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:34,122
and that you practically
live on that field...

133
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:35,558
Hold on.

134
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:37,168
Beats the players up?

135
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:39,170
I'm the one that gets beat up.

136
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:41,738
I'm the one who plays hurt.
Check your records.

137
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:43,697
I've never taken a day off
during the season

138
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,699
in the eleven years
I've been here.

139
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:49,180
I've destroyed two marriages because
of the time that I put in around here.

140
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,922
Nobody's saying that you're
not trying to do your job.

141
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:54,011
Wait a minute, don't tell me
you're whacking me?

142
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:55,883
- I have a right...
- Relax.

143
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,581
Nobody's gonna lose their jobs
over this.

144
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,322
Well,
it certainly wouldn't be mine.

145
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:01,584
What are you talking about?

146
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:05,675
I think it's pretty obvious.
You need to understand.

147
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:07,677
Football at Seneca is a religion.

148
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,420
A choice. And let's not forget
a source of revenue.

149
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:17,426
Look, there will always be that handful
of malcontents who need to be dealt with.

150
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:19,689
And it's your job
to shut those people up.

151
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,126
Do you need me for anything else?

152
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:25,347
No, thank you.

153
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,091
- Coach.
- Yes.

154
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:36,750
You just keep them boys winning,
whatever it takes.

155
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:41,668
Whatever it takes.

156
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,847
At least the Vice Principal
wants a winner around here.

157
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,380
Are my eyes puffy?

158
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:00,121
No, babe. You look great.

159
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:01,209
What is that?

160
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:04,865
Oh. My. God.

161
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:09,913
Oh, my God.

162
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,835
I guess it's safe here, right?

163
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,578
You know, these retro cars
are really coming back in style.

164
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,275
Really?

165
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:25,537
- No!
- No!

166
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:34,677
But seriously, do you have to park
this "thing" next to my car?

167
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:36,723
It's a parking lot.

168
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:40,378
Yeah, but when the tow truck comes
to take it away, it could scratch my car

169
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:42,163
which is probably worth
more than your house.

170
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:45,035
Oh, and...

171
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:46,602
Have a good day, short bus.

172
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,516
Let's go.

173
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,699
I'm totally nervous about how
today is gonna be. Hi, Principal Banks.

174
00:10:56,743 --> 00:10:59,006
- I'll see you at tryouts, babe.
- Bye.

175
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:00,311
- Hey, girls.
- Hi.

176
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:02,444
- Big day for the Cougars.
- Yes.

177
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:04,315
I want y'all to pick
some winners for me.

178
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:06,013
We'll do our best.

179
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:08,232
We need some champions 'cuz
you're gonna be gone next year.

180
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:09,407
I mean, you know.

181
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:10,780
Well, it's gonna be hard
to beat this.

182
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,411
You certainly are a part
of history here so...

183
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:15,283
- Thanks Mr. Banks.
- ...just do what you can.

184
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:17,241
- 'Kay, bye.
- Alright, y'all be good.

185
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:19,200
A part of history here?

186
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:21,071
So is your name
on the bathroom wall.

187
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:24,292
Oh, what? You jealous
'cuz yours isn't up there?

188
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:27,208
Oh, not at all, sweetie.
Mine's right under yours.

189
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:29,123
Except it says,
"Call for a better time."

190
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,341
Good one.

191
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:31,473
Right.

192
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,217
We are so gonna get that.

193
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,609
What about her girlfriend?

194
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:39,699
Who wears sweatpants to school?

195
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:40,874
I wear sweatpants.

196
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,224
She does wear pants
around her ankles.

197
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,052
Accurate.

198
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:47,402
Wait. They're coming.
Hurry up. Get in the stalls.

199
00:11:57,194 --> 00:11:58,761
Really?

200
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,112
That is frigin' disgusting.

201
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:03,723
Can you not do that in my face?

202
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:08,292
In fact, can you not do that
in my school?

203
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:10,164
We're sorry.

204
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:13,210
Look. I get it.

205
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:17,258
Ugly girls can't get guys so you hook up
with each other. It makes total sense.

206
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:19,434
I mean, I guess you could
hook up with other ugly guys

207
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:23,003
and have ugly kids but, you
just can't fix ugly, I suppose.

208
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:24,700
Look, we didn't mean
to offend you, okay?

209
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,572
Oh, you didn't offend me,
my little bulldyke. No.

210
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:30,750
Make me wanna throw up my intestines
in the toilet? Yeah, maybe.

211
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:33,840
Speaking of toilets...

212
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:34,884
Girls.

213
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,024
Okay, girls, we're ready to begin.

214
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:46,504
Hi there, how are you?
What's your name?

215
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:48,811
- Marie Carter. Senior.
- Marie Carter.

216
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:50,770
Senior. How are you?

217
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:53,250
There you go. Good luck.
Please take a picture.

218
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:54,121
Next.

219
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:56,277
Hi there, what's your name?

220
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:59,561
- Trish Malone, junior.
- Hi.

221
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:00,997
There you go. Good luck.

222
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,956
- Get your picture taken, please.
- You know...

223
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,261
- I got it by memory.
- Next.

224
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:08,439
- Hi.
- Lori Cobalt, freshman.

225
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:11,051
Lori. You're so cute. I like it.

226
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:12,400
- There you go.
- Thanks.

227
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:14,402
- Good luck. Get your picture taken.
- Smile.

228
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:15,577
Next.

229
00:13:16,926 --> 00:13:18,885
- Hi there.
- Hi. Lisa Mullin.

230
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:21,409
- Sophomore.
- Oh. Cute bracelet.

231
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:23,541
I love that. Nikki, that's so you.

232
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:25,195
Check it out.

233
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:27,458
Oh, so cute. Give it to me.

234
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:32,724
- I'm just kidding... relax.
- It's so cute. Here you go.

235
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:35,640
Talia forgot to wear
her contacts this morning.

236
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:36,816
What do you mean?

237
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,382
Next.

238
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:40,254
Hi, Maddie McKinem. Freshman.

239
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:42,299
There you go.

240
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,435
Next.

241
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:49,306
Did you just give that girl
a form?

242
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,960
Oh, I don't know. Which one?

243
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:51,918
The one over there.

244
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:52,962
Get it back.

245
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:54,007
Okay.

246
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,313
Demi.

247
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:57,923
Can you get the form back
from that loser...

248
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,839
Now! Please.

249
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:01,710
Next.

250
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,495
- Hi.
- Hi.

251
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:05,670
Julie Klein, sophomore.

252
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:06,541
Turn around, Julie.

253
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:09,370
Okay, you'll do.
Great. Here you go.

254
00:14:09,413 --> 00:14:11,459
- Good luck. - Read it over.
- Have your parents sign it.

255
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:12,764
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

256
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:13,983
Look at these girls.

257
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,594
Yup, Geek.

258
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,466
- Accurate.
- Anorexic.

259
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:19,859
- True.
- Daddy issues.

260
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,077
- Also true.
- Okay, hey!

261
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:22,644
I didn't line 'em up. Okay?

262
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:23,732
You're picking them.

263
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:24,733
Next.

264
00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:25,952
I said next!

265
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:32,219
Hi. Elle Wurthmore. Freshman.

266
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,444
Hello?

267
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:42,011
What the hell is that on her face?

268
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:44,535
Hi. Elle, is it?

269
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:47,712
We, We've reached
our limit today. Sorry.

270
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,072
- Oh, oh, my...
- Clearly, you're in the wrong place.

271
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:04,164
This is for the Seneca Cougars,
not the Kruegers.

272
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:06,601
Don't fall asleep!

273
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:07,994
But the school paper said that...

274
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:10,126
I know what the school paper
said. I wrote it.

275
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,954
But we've reached our limit.

276
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:14,174
- So, I'm sorry, Miss...
- Wurthmore.

277
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,654
Wurthmore. Of course.

278
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,290
You know what? Maybe you could try
the drama club. I hear they're looking.

279
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,921
Peter Pan, fly away.

280
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:23,270
Tragic.

281
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:25,925
It's Wurthmore.

282
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,491
More like Worth-less.

283
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:29,798
Next!

284
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:46,162
Do you ever not wanna go to work
because the weather's so nice?

285
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:48,121
Today is one of those days.

286
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:50,732
Gorgeous day outside.
Lots of sunshine.

287
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:53,822
Thanks for hanging out with us
on WMNT The Mint Radio.

288
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:55,128
It's 7:06.

289
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:57,826
Really, Mom?

290
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:00,220
I think that was loud enough to
wake up the whole Davidson family

291
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:01,612
and they live 3 blocks down.

292
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:05,138
What are you talking about?
I didn't hear anything.

293
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,749
Can you leave me some money?

294
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:10,271
I'm going over to Kendra's and we want
to buy from the ice cream truck.

295
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:13,711
What did I tell you?
No more ice cream!

296
00:16:13,755 --> 00:16:17,106
You're getting a belly already
from eating all that crap at Kendra's.

297
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,979
- And I'm not raising a fat kid.
- I'm not fat.

298
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,894
Yeah, not yet, but if you keep
eating all that crap, you're gonna be.

299
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:25,288
You need to be more selective
of who your friends are.

300
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:27,116
I never hung out with fat people.

301
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,684
Okay...
Then, can I order a fruit cup?

302
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:31,468
I think they have fruit cups
on the truck.

303
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:33,993
Yeah, that's okay.

304
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:36,125
- Who's it?
- It's Daddy.

305
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:39,172
Alright, give me the phone.
I'll meet you downstairs in a few. Okay?

306
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,743
Listen, babe. Little change
in plans. I'm really sorry.

307
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:47,484
I'm not gonna be able to make it
by this morning.

308
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:49,660
I got a shot to close
that deal I've been waiting on.

309
00:16:49,704 --> 00:16:52,707
I'm at my sister's house now and she's gonna
drive me to the airport in a little bit.

310
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,319
Oh, come on, Cody. You promised.

311
00:16:56,363 --> 00:16:57,842
Won't you please come
and work for my dad,

312
00:16:57,886 --> 00:16:59,670
then we can spend
more time together.

313
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:02,630
This is huge for us.
Hold on, my phone's dying.

314
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:07,983
And besides, nobody just works
for your father.

315
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,724
He possesses their soul.

316
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:11,943
Alright, be safe.

317
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:14,361
Because I'm gonna need you in a few weeks
for our marriage. That's kinda important.

318
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:19,038
And tell your cheerleading crew
that tonight isn't a bachelorette party.

319
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,691
Bye.

320
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:25,653
- Oh, no, no donuts. No donuts.
- Oh, c'mon. Really?

321
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:27,263
- Please!
- Go get ready for school.

322
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:29,178
We have to take your uncle
to the airport.

323
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:31,006
Really, bro? Donuts?

324
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:33,182
How did she take it?

325
00:17:33,226 --> 00:17:35,010
It's Talia, but I love her.

326
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:36,403
Well, here.

327
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:40,015
You can give her this
when you get back.

328
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,756
It's more her style
than mine anyway.

329
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,497
You truly are the best.

330
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,628
5 more minutes guys.

331
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:47,153
- Can we have pretzels?
- Just one.

332
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:49,894
- Can we have two?
- Just one.

333
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:14,876
- Hey, Talia?
- What, Jazz?

334
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:17,052
- Show me how to get down.
- Okay!

335
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,550
- You guys are good.
- Thank you.

336
00:19:20,594 --> 00:19:22,161
You liked it?

337
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:24,337
My luscious, leopard lady...

338
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:26,295
Excuse me, ma'am, sorry...

339
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,254
Woo! Who saw the dance moves?

340
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:29,907
- Jeez!
- C'mon, bro!

341
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:32,388
Come on. Ma'am. I'm so...

342
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:33,563
You know what?

343
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,130
That stain will definitely
come out.

344
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,740
My mom got the same dress.

345
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,742
She wears it all the time.

346
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:41,136
- Are you kidding?
- Yeah. It's a nice dress.

347
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,357
- Guys, seriously?
- What?

348
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,011
Demi, can you just shut up?
Shut up! Just order us food, please.

349
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:49,057
Hey, Hey, Jen.
Have you seen Talia?

350
00:19:49,753 --> 00:19:51,581
Try the terrace.

351
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,694
I just tried to say hello to her but
she's in one of those moods again.

352
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:55,716
Well, some jackass
just spilled a drink on her.

353
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,413
Yeah.
That's no reason to blow me off.

354
00:19:57,457 --> 00:19:59,589
She's a little upset.
What do you expect?

355
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,983
You should know her by now.
You're her business partner.

356
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:06,944
On paper. Her father controls everything
in her life including our business.

357
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:08,317
You should know that
better than anyone.

358
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:09,643
Unfortunately, I do.

359
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:11,427
Yeah. So, you...

360
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:12,582
- Do you want to come with us
or go with Tommy? - With you.

361
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:14,082
- Okay.
- Wait, have you met Lucy?

362
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:16,215
Hi.

363
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,370
She's the new CFO of
Harley Medici cosmetics.

364
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,087
Oh, yeah.

365
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,610
No offense, but, Jen?

366
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:22,612
When are you guys gonna start
hiring some hot guys?

367
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:24,266
Stay away from this one.

368
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,486
- Listen, we gotta go but good luck upstairs.
- Thanks.

369
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:35,799
How is it possible
that out of everyone

370
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:37,279
bumping into each other
down there,

371
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:40,108
you're the only one who gets
a drink spilled on them.

372
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:43,459
Are you kidding me? I thought he was coming
up to me and then all of a sudden "boom".

373
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:45,331
He like, goes into the other girl.

374
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:47,333
I'm so not the hot topic anymore.

375
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:48,464
Stop!

376
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:50,423
You're getting married
in two weeks

377
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:52,860
and you're worried about
being in the spotlight?

378
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:55,254
I don't know, it's like
I feel like I'm getting old.

379
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:58,387
And, you know, I had my child
when I was too young.

380
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,654
Abby is doing great in school

381
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:03,827
and I just bumped into your
business partner down there.

382
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:08,484
And the cosmetics company is doing great.
You're with an amazing guy.

383
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:10,486
I don't know, I just...

384
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:14,185
I feel like me and the girls should
come over again tomorrow and talk.

385
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:17,232
Whatever, I have to make that
speech tomorrow at the reunion.

386
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,758
Talia, there is no reunion!

387
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:25,762
I don't know if this is coming from
the alcohol, or the prescriptions,

388
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:29,940
or even if you're gonna remember
this tomorrow but there's no reunion.

389
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:32,726
You're so messing with me!

390
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:33,683
I'm not!

391
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:34,989
Yeah, you are.

392
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:39,298
Look, I know you're sick
and tired of hearing it from us

393
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:43,345
but please, just do it for Abby.

394
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,096
Right? After last night who knows.
Leah drover her home.

395
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:57,272
Are you and your mom
still doing to the shower?

396
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,056
We weren't invited.

397
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:00,754
Hold on.

398
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:04,018
Skyann, get that spoon
out of your mouth.

399
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:07,848
One of these days, you are gonna
fall down and knock all of your teeth out

400
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:11,242
and all the kids at school are gonna
call you a freak. Is that what you want?

401
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:12,722
No, I don't wanna be a freak.

402
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,594
What did we say about freaks?

403
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:17,248
Freaks eat their lunch by themselves
and they don't have any friends.

404
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:19,947
And no daughter of mine
is going to be a freak.

405
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,169
So just stop running around
and watch TV or something.

406
00:22:22,189 --> 00:22:23,211
Alright. Sorry, Mom.

407
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:28,129
Sorry, what was I saying?
We weren't invited.

408
00:22:28,172 --> 00:22:30,285
Yeah, of course you're invited.
You're in the wedding party.

409
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:32,351
I sent out the shower invites.

410
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:33,656
Shut up!

411
00:22:34,178 --> 00:22:35,354
That dog.

412
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:38,095
The neighbor's dog
is in your yard again.

413
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:39,880
Hey, let me call you back.
Leah just got here.

414
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:42,143
I will call you back.

415
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:43,405
Bye.

416
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:47,540
Why don't you just call
animal control?

417
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:48,454
On who?

418
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:49,890
The dog or the neighbors?

419
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:51,848
Is that the new guy on the phone?

420
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:53,894
No. That was dead
before it even started.

421
00:22:54,677 --> 00:22:56,418
It's Demi.
She was gonna bring Skyann over

422
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:58,855
but as usual, Vinny was late so...

423
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:00,857
Of course, he was. He's a scumbag.

424
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:02,293
Yeah.

425
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:04,470
What were you guys talking about?

426
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:07,473
Talia and how nice
it must be to have Daddy

427
00:23:07,516 --> 00:23:09,388
that pays for private school
for Abby.

428
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:13,174
I personally think that she needs
more help than she's getting.

429
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,874
She's on the meds and mixing them with the
alcohol, I mean, that's not helping any.

430
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:20,616
- Yeah.
- I was with her 'til 3 in the morning.

431
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:24,011
What's her deal
with the whole reunion thing?

432
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,969
You should have seen her.

433
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:28,102
I'm not kidding.

434
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:30,885
I don't know where she's going but she
thinks she has this big speech to make.

435
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:33,194
I'm worried about her.

436
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:34,325
I'm not.

437
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,720
Okay, where did that come from?

438
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:40,419
I don't mean it like that,
I just mean that, you know,

439
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,333
she's had everything
handed to her.

440
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:44,640
You think she's co-owner
of this cosmetic company?

441
00:23:44,684 --> 00:23:47,251
You don't think Daddy had
something to do with those contracts?

442
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:48,296
Must be nice.

443
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:52,256
I mean, I just live.
I barely get by. You know?

444
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:57,218
Like, I have to go to court to get support
from my ex, and then my bills are behind.

445
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:59,568
Like, I haven't paid my mortgage
in two months.

446
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:03,920
Speaking of mortgages,
you remember her?

447
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:05,618
Trish?

448
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:12,451
Trish Ma... Home Alone Malone.

449
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:13,974
Yeah, how could I forget her?

450
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:15,454
I mean,
we used to torment that girl.

451
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:19,370
She married a New York lawyer.

452
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:22,635
And I just showed them a
2 million dollar home last week.

453
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:25,507
Does this lawyer have
any brothers?

454
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:28,554
Or sisters? I mean, I'm not picky.

455
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:32,601
You know what's sad?

456
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:35,343
I didn't even recognize her
but she knew exactly who I was.

457
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:38,781
I have no idea
how many trainers it took

458
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:42,132
but she sure as hell does not
look like that anymore.

459
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,787
Did she say anything about us?

460
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:45,658
No.

461
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,226
She did mention Talia
and what a bitch she was.

462
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,794
Yeah, well, we all followed
her lead in high school.

463
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:55,494
Yeah, but we followed her lead, so,
we didn't become one of her victims.

464
00:24:56,364 --> 00:24:59,802
And come on, somewhere along the way,
we did become her friend.

465
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:02,936
What's wrong?

466
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:06,461
Sophie's been coming home
crying lately.

467
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:10,552
I guess some kids on the bus were making
fun of her for where she got dropped off

468
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:14,469
and then, you know, they were
like making fun of her clothes and...

469
00:25:16,384 --> 00:25:19,909
I don't know. I'm doing what I can,
you know? Like, I just feel bad.

470
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:21,868
I can't imagine feeling like that.

471
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:23,347
She's five.

472
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:26,481
They're just kids being kids.
It's not even the same.

473
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,702
It's not kids just being kids. Do you
remember Trish Malone when we were five?

474
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:32,835
She hid from us in the bathroom.

475
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:35,359
She ate her lunch in there so,
she didn't have to deal with us.

476
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:44,586
- Do you believe in karma?
- What?

477
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,589
Karma, you know, like if you
do something, and like...

478
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:50,287
Yeah, I know what karma is,
Nikki. I'm not an idiot.

479
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:53,116
We were all the same.

480
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,859
We were all assholes, bitches, whatever
you wanted to call us, that's what we were.

481
00:25:56,903 --> 00:25:58,426
But if karma were going to happen,

482
00:25:58,469 --> 00:26:00,078
don't you think
it would've happened by now?

483
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:03,474
Why do you even have
the Paw Print out?

484
00:26:03,518 --> 00:26:05,085
I don't know,
Talia at the reunion.

485
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:07,172
I guess I just wanted to think
about good times, you know?

486
00:26:07,696 --> 00:26:08,654
Okay.

487
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,526
How about this?

488
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,398
Why don't we crash
Talia's reunion?

489
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:16,618
Dressed like that?

490
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:18,664
Why not?

491
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:20,927
I mean, let's make our own
theme, "Come As You Are".

492
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,059
I mean, you think she's home?

493
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:24,887
Should we call her?

494
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:26,062
I'll call her.

495
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:29,718
Alright.
I mean cool, use my phone.

496
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:32,199
I wouldn't go through pictures
if I were you.

497
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:33,157
You're disgusting.

498
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:35,942
I mean, you could,
if you're into that, that's cool.

499
00:26:35,985 --> 00:26:38,988
Hey, it's Abby.

500
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:11,760
Hey, it's Abby.
Mom and I aren't home right now.

501
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:14,023
If you leave your name and number,
we'll call when we return.

502
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:15,285
Thanks. Bye.

503
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:21,161
Hey, Talia, it's Leah.

504
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:24,686
Listen, I'm with Nikki right now and we were
just gonna stop by to see what you were doing,

505
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:30,170
but apparently, we missed you, so,
I will give you a ring on your cell

506
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:32,302
and hopefully you didn't leave
for the reunion yet.

507
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:33,826
Alright, I'll see you in a bit.

508
00:27:56,587 --> 00:27:59,895
Oh, Mama Mia. Come to Daddy.

509
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,553
You better not be messing with me.

510
00:28:05,596 --> 00:28:07,033
I know you must know
about the reunion.

511
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:10,863
Sorry to interrupt.
I'm Mario Tressi, limo driver?

512
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:13,517
Is that the luggage
for the car, Ma'am?

513
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,694
Obviously,
they're there for the car.

514
00:28:16,172 --> 00:28:18,000
The guy is so annoying.

515
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:22,875
Wait, hold on. The address is on
the bottom, assuming you could read?

516
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:28,358
No, it's just that
he's annoying, and... Wait!

517
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:31,187
The luggage. It costs more than your
house. Would you please be careful?

518
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,407
My apologies, Ma'am.

519
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,235
...nothing, this guy's retarted.

520
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:36,889
He's like, 35 minutes late.

521
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:38,412
Whatever, there goes his tip.

522
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:47,551
Alright, let's see what we got.

523
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:54,297
Seneca High School.

524
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:55,777
I'll talk to you later.

525
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:56,865
Alright, bye.

526
00:28:58,214 --> 00:29:00,564
Hello?

527
00:29:04,307 --> 00:29:05,787
Everything okay, Ma'am?

528
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:07,006
Hello?

529
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:08,204
Are you going to open up
the door for me?

530
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,660
Oh, yes, Ma'am, right away.

531
00:29:11,532 --> 00:29:13,644
And stop calling me Ma'am.
You're making me feel old.

532
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:14,361
Yes, Ma'am.

533
00:29:14,404 --> 00:29:16,102
Of course, of course.

534
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:19,105
Mario Tressi, Black Tie Classics,

535
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:22,543
hoping that you'll consider us
for all your limousine needs.

536
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:25,459
I can think of a few
other needs too.

537
00:29:25,502 --> 00:29:28,810
I don't have to have the car back 'til
Monday. If you know what I mean.

538
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:29,768
Perfect.

539
00:29:30,725 --> 00:29:31,900
Is Abby inside?

540
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:34,816
- Yeah, she's inside.
- Okay, great.

541
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,385
Oh, and by the way, I absolutely
love the reunion themed attire.

542
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:39,995
Why? What's wrong with my clothes?

543
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:42,345
Nothing, great concept, I mean,
if they don't recognize you,

544
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:44,347
they'll at least recognize
the same outfit.

545
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:47,481
Is there anything else derogatory or
negative that you want to say to me?

546
00:29:47,524 --> 00:29:50,440
No. I'm good. Thanks.

547
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,298
Are you kidding?

548
00:31:05,341 --> 00:31:06,908
You scared the shit outta me.

549
00:31:06,952 --> 00:31:08,127
Sorry.

550
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,736
I thought maybe
something happened to you.

551
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:15,656
- Where is everyone?
- I don't know. Maybe they parked out back.

552
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:39,898
Hello?

553
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:41,725
Hello?

554
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,382
Are you here with the reunion?

555
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:53,650
You scared the shit outta me.

556
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:54,956
That's the second time now.

557
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,610
What? You fell asleep again?

558
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:58,351
Yeah, I fell asleep standing up.

559
00:31:59,134 --> 00:32:00,396
Where the hell is everyone?

560
00:32:01,397 --> 00:32:02,224
I don't know.

561
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:05,010
Could be a surprise party for you.

562
00:32:06,446 --> 00:32:10,537
I mean you are a Seneca High
Goddess legend, right?

563
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,669
Well, yeah. I used to be.

564
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:14,671
Yeah.
Well, I'd say you still got it.

565
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:17,892
Perhaps you'd like
to freshen up a bit

566
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,676
before you make
your grand entrance?

567
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,287
Yeah, that's a good idea.

568
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,332
Stay here. I'll be back.

569
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:47,661
Hello?

570
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,407
Hello?

571
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:56,496
Hello?

572
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:24,176
- We are so gonna get that.
- - What about her girlfriend?

573
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:27,179
- Who wears sweatpants to school?
- I wear sweatpants.

574
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:29,529
She does wear pants
around her ankles.

575
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:31,357
Accurate!

576
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,707
Wait. They're coming.
Hurry up. Get in the stalls.

577
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:44,848
Really?

578
00:33:45,762 --> 00:33:48,026
That is frigin' disgusting.

579
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:49,679
Can you not do that in my face?

580
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,989
In fact,
don't do that in my school.

581
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,425
We're... sorry.

582
00:33:56,469 --> 00:33:58,906
No, look, I get it.

583
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:04,520
Ugly girls can't get guys, so, you hook up
with each other. It makes total sense.

584
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:06,609
I mean, you could actually
hook up with ugly guys

585
00:34:06,653 --> 00:34:09,482
and have ugly babies,
but you can't fix ugly.

586
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:11,049
Look, we didn't mean
to offend you.

587
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:13,616
Oh, you didn't offend me,
you little bulldyke.

588
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,270
No.

589
00:34:15,314 --> 00:34:17,707
Make me wanna throw up
my guts in the toilet? Yeah, maybe.

590
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:22,190
Actually, speaking of toilets...
Girls!

591
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,892
Why are you being so mean?

592
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:41,688
Mario?

593
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:43,646
Mario?

594
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:50,392
Mario!

595
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:54,222
Mario!

596
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,539
Mario?

597
00:35:06,582 --> 00:35:09,019
I don't know what just happened
but I'm losing my mind!

598
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:10,412
I swear to God!

599
00:35:10,456 --> 00:35:12,371
Hey, I'm only the tour guide.

600
00:35:12,414 --> 00:35:15,200
You wanted a reunion?
Now you've got it.

601
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:19,900
Who is this?

602
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:21,316
By your words
you shall be justified.

603
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:23,686
By your words
you shall be condemned.

604
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:43,315
...you just can't fix
ugly, I suppose.

605
00:35:43,924 --> 00:35:47,101
...ugly girls...
You can't fix ugly, I suppose.

606
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:04,988
Do you even know
what the word means?

607
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:09,297
Place is an undescribed area.

608
00:36:10,994 --> 00:36:16,174
I mean, just using one wrong word
can lead a client to jail.

609
00:36:23,485 --> 00:36:27,054
You really need to understand
what words mean.

610
00:36:37,804 --> 00:36:42,243
Can you come to the principal's office,
please, sweetie?

611
00:37:36,602 --> 00:37:38,299
Mr. and Mrs. Medici.
How you doing?

612
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:40,325
Thank you for coming in.
My name is Principal Banks.

613
00:37:40,345 --> 00:37:41,433
Yeah, I know who you are.

614
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:42,782
Just, how long is this gonna take?

615
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:44,087
And what's this about?

616
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:45,567
It shouldn't be long.

617
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:47,070
As soon as we get
your daughter Talia in here...

618
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,048
Oh, sweetie.

619
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:51,573
What's going on?

620
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:53,445
- Nothing.
- Talia, please sit.

621
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:56,361
Daddy. You disrupting the entire
planet again and my schedule no less.

622
00:37:56,404 --> 00:37:58,319
- What schedule?
- What are you even doing here?

623
00:37:58,363 --> 00:38:00,321
One, I am a part of this family,

624
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:03,150
and two, I have a reputation
to protect and the family name

625
00:38:03,193 --> 00:38:05,195
which, by the way, you are
so carelessly destroying.

626
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:07,285
Okay, Jazz. That's enough.

627
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:10,940
Talia, did you throw toilet
water in somebody's face?

628
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:13,378
What? No! I did no such thing.

629
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:16,163
Case closed.

630
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:18,774
She said she didn't do it.

631
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:21,342
It's not something my daughter
would do.

632
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:27,827
Okay, Rebecca, can you come in
here for a second, please?

633
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:37,532
Rebecca? We have rules here
against making up stories

634
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:39,926
in an attempt to get another
student suspended.

635
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:43,059
She threw water...

636
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:45,671
No, no. That's okay.
You're dismissed.

637
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:50,415
Well, I guess we'll be on our way.

638
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,720
C'mon, sweetie.

639
00:38:51,764 --> 00:38:54,723
Yeah, just hold on
for a second. Just...

640
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:00,076
What do you say
we give Talia two days off just,

641
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,211
you know, make the other side
think that she's suspended.

642
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:05,212
What?

643
00:39:05,778 --> 00:39:07,997
Woah, woah, woah.

644
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:11,174
Did you not just hear
what my daughter said?

645
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:12,785
She didn't do it.

646
00:39:12,828 --> 00:39:15,048
Your logic makes no sense
whatsoever.

647
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:16,658
And I'm agreeing with you,
Mr. Medici.

648
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:18,486
I just think that we can...

649
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:22,664
Just because some bimbo comes
in here and makes false accusations

650
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:24,971
because she's jealous
of my daughter,

651
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:28,801
she's gonna have a permanent
suspension on her record?

652
00:39:28,844 --> 00:39:30,106
Gio, calm down.

653
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,412
No, I won't calm down.

654
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:33,719
Okay, alright.
This conversation's over.

655
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:36,112
I can't... I can't allow...

656
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:39,729
When it comes to my daughter,
it's over when I say it's over,

657
00:39:39,749 --> 00:39:41,770
so, you can just sit back down.

658
00:39:41,814 --> 00:39:42,815
- Gio!
- Dad.

659
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:44,100
Who do you think
you're talking to?

660
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,905
I am the principal,
this is my house.

661
00:39:46,558 --> 00:39:49,430
You don't get to come into
my office and disrespect me.

662
00:39:49,474 --> 00:39:50,866
Okay, enough! I did it.

663
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:53,042
Okay? I splashed the tramp.

664
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:26,641
Hello?

665
00:40:29,862 --> 00:40:30,863
Hello?

666
00:40:30,906 --> 00:40:32,517
Talia, where are you?

667
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,649
I don't know.

668
00:40:35,563 --> 00:40:41,221
I was at Seneca and now,
I'm in some kind of jail.

669
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:44,267
A jail? Just go find the locker.

670
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:45,617
What lockers?

671
00:40:47,183 --> 00:40:48,968
Just find the locker.

672
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:06,088
See something you like, Colten?

673
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:08,047
Keep walking.

674
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:11,920
Who is that?

675
00:42:17,186 --> 00:42:19,014
Hey. Hi. What's your name?

676
00:42:19,058 --> 00:42:21,016
I'm Tricia
but you guys can call me Trish.

677
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,453
I can see your trash.

678
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:24,803
Your skirt short enough?

679
00:42:24,846 --> 00:42:27,153
Look, I didn't mean to start
any trouble.

680
00:42:27,196 --> 00:42:28,589
I mean, it's just a skirt.

681
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:31,331
Oh, honey, that skirt
is the least of your problems.

682
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:33,551
I mean, did you put
your makeup on in the dark?

683
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,770
Like she would do any better
in the light.

684
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:39,382
So, where you from, Trash?

685
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:41,863
It's Trish. And Idaho.

686
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:45,258
Oh, that's sweet.
I mean, she admitted it.

687
00:42:45,301 --> 00:42:46,172
She's a hoe.

688
00:42:46,215 --> 00:42:47,695
I said Idaho.

689
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:50,959
- Can you not touch my stuff?
- Hey!

690
00:42:51,743 --> 00:42:54,006
Listen,
you potato picking prostitute.

691
00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:56,356
There are 5 girls around here
the boys can look at

692
00:42:56,399 --> 00:42:58,706
and you are certainly
not one of them. Got it?

693
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:03,276
I certainly wasn't looking for attention
from any boys and I'm not a prostitute.

694
00:43:03,842 --> 00:43:04,756
Do you see this?

695
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:07,541
It's definitely not her shade.

696
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,369
Is anything her shade?

697
00:43:09,412 --> 00:43:12,198
But around here,
I tell you what you'll be.

698
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:13,329
Understand?

699
00:43:14,026 --> 00:43:16,724
Go back to
where you came from, Trash.

700
00:43:19,727 --> 00:43:22,904
Who has a picture of themselves
in their locker anyway?

701
00:43:22,948 --> 00:43:24,471
Accurate.

702
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,214
- We got us a slut here, boys.
- Bye!

703
00:43:28,257 --> 00:43:29,955
Also accurate.

704
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:34,612
Honey, are you okay?

705
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:36,570
- What happened?
- I don't know.

706
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,813
I was just getting my books and
these girls, they started insulting me...

707
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,661
I'm sorry, sweetheart, one second.

708
00:43:40,705 --> 00:43:42,358
Hey. Hold up a second,
I have to talk to you.

709
00:43:42,968 --> 00:43:44,186
I'm so sorry.

710
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,754
Sweetheart,
there are policies against this.

711
00:43:46,798 --> 00:43:49,191
I just don't know exactly
what they are.

712
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:52,717
I would say speak to the janitor
and get this graffiti taken care of.

713
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,024
You are not allowed to have
anything derogatory on your locker.

714
00:43:56,068 --> 00:43:57,722
You could get in really
big trouble for that.

715
00:43:57,765 --> 00:43:59,898
Okay?

716
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:02,941
Yeah, did you get my voicemail? I'm sorry,
sweetheart. Are we still on for tonight?

717
00:44:26,098 --> 00:44:28,274
I don't wanna be here anymore.

718
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,930
Hey.

719
00:44:33,279 --> 00:44:34,106
It's okay.

720
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:36,543
Stop.

721
00:44:37,544 --> 00:44:38,414
Stop it.

722
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:40,460
Stop it!

723
00:44:53,908 --> 00:44:56,650
Stop it!

724
00:44:58,608 --> 00:45:00,112
We got ourselves
a slut here, boys.

725
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:04,832
Trash.

726
00:45:57,276 --> 00:45:58,103
Mom!

727
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:20,560
Do you have a girlfriend, Gabe?

728
00:46:20,603 --> 00:46:22,780
No girlfriend?
More like a boyfriend.

729
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:25,217
He definitely doesn't swing this way.
C'mon, look at him.

730
00:46:27,306 --> 00:46:32,180
Hey, Talia, did you remember to bring
a uniform for little Miss Gabe-y Wurton?

731
00:46:32,224 --> 00:46:35,009
Oh, right.

732
00:46:35,053 --> 00:46:39,318
You know, I haven't gotten
his skirt size yet.

733
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:43,931
Stand up, sweetie. C'mon.

734
00:46:45,324 --> 00:46:49,067
The water boy can't go out
on the field without a uniform.

735
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:52,244
Turn.

736
00:46:52,287 --> 00:46:55,334
I'm thinking like a real
short skirt, don't you think?

737
00:46:55,377 --> 00:46:57,292
Yeah?

738
00:46:57,336 --> 00:46:59,579
Maybe something that shows your butt
cheeks kind of like Nikki always does.

739
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:00,774
Accurate.

740
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,735
Or you could always go commando
like Pam does.

741
00:47:05,779 --> 00:47:09,304
I think they're more than grateful
for the motivation I provide.

742
00:47:09,348 --> 00:47:10,653
Shut up.

743
00:47:10,697 --> 00:47:12,090
Trust me. We're grateful.

744
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,702
Hey! Really?

745
00:47:16,137 --> 00:47:21,316
But you know, we really don't wanna see
your jewels dangling when we lift you up.

746
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,883
- You know what I mean, Gabe?
- Not too.

747
00:47:22,927 --> 00:47:24,885
Bye!

748
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:31,299
No!

749
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:11,209
Hello?

750
00:49:11,818 --> 00:49:12,645
Hello?

751
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:15,735
Who is this?

752
00:49:15,778 --> 00:49:18,172
What do you mean
who is this? It's your fiancé.

753
00:49:18,912 --> 00:49:20,131
How do I know it's you?

754
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:23,263
Excuse me?
What the hell's going on?

755
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:26,833
Where are you?

756
00:49:26,876 --> 00:49:29,311
I'm in the auditorium.
Everybody's here waiting for you.

757
00:49:29,444 --> 00:49:30,271
I...

758
00:49:31,055 --> 00:49:32,099
I'm at Seneca.

759
00:49:32,143 --> 00:49:35,581
I'm at Seneca I think,
I'm not sure.

760
00:49:35,624 --> 00:49:36,974
Yeah, I'm at Seneca too.

761
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,889
You are? Where are you?

762
00:49:39,933 --> 00:49:41,587
I'm in the auditorium.

763
00:49:44,416 --> 00:49:47,288
There's really a reunion?

764
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:49,856
Hello?

765
00:49:53,425 --> 00:49:54,252
Hello?

766
00:50:41,168 --> 00:50:43,082
And I know
we've all come a long way.

767
00:50:43,649 --> 00:50:45,651
Welcome back after fifteen years.

768
00:51:22,601 --> 00:51:27,693
Today,
I learned a lot about myself...

769
00:51:30,217 --> 00:51:36,702
that I'm selfish, I'm egotistical,

770
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:47,365
I'm self-centered,
and I'm a bully.

771
00:51:48,844 --> 00:51:54,720
In high school, it's supposed to be
some of the best memories of your life.

772
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:08,516
And I know that I've ruined them
for a lot of you people...

773
00:52:12,738 --> 00:52:13,869
and I'm sorry.

774
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:19,788
That's just all I've ever known.

775
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,388
Seriously,
is computers a real skill?

776
00:52:54,432 --> 00:52:55,868
No, it's such a waste of time.

777
00:52:55,911 --> 00:52:57,304
When are we ever gonna
use computers?

778
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:00,699
Nice try.

779
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:06,618
Well, well, well.
What do we have here?

780
00:53:06,661 --> 00:53:07,880
What are you doing?

781
00:53:07,923 --> 00:53:08,881
Give me that! That's my...

782
00:53:08,924 --> 00:53:10,752
- Give it to me!
- Hey!

783
00:53:10,796 --> 00:53:12,145
Watch it.

784
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:17,281
"Dear Mom..."

785
00:53:17,324 --> 00:53:18,610
- Awww.
- It's a love letter.

786
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,501
- It's personal.
- Don't even try.

787
00:53:20,545 --> 00:53:23,417
- "I hate Seneca. The girls are so..."
- Seriously?

788
00:53:23,461 --> 00:53:26,028
- Move along, tramp, let's go.
- Busy here.

789
00:53:26,768 --> 00:53:28,553
"These girls are all bullies."

790
00:53:29,162 --> 00:53:30,424
Hi, Ms. Price.

791
00:53:30,468 --> 00:53:31,904
Let's keep it to a minimum.

792
00:53:31,947 --> 00:53:34,646
Of course, Ms. Price. Of course.

793
00:53:36,561 --> 00:53:40,347
"These girls are all bullies and
they make me feel like the biggest loser."

794
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:46,397
"I hate Talia. I hate her so much.

795
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,748
I'm afraid to give you this letter but
I keep thinking about killing myself

796
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:51,140
and I want you to help me."

797
00:53:51,184 --> 00:53:54,318
You want your mother
to help you kill yourself?

798
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:57,495
Sweetheart, listen.
It's really not that hard.

799
00:53:57,538 --> 00:54:00,759
Instead of putting bleach in your hair,
just put it in your mouth.

800
00:54:00,802 --> 00:54:04,110
Or, I have razors. You clearly
don't know how to use one

801
00:54:04,153 --> 00:54:05,590
but I can help you out.

802
00:54:05,633 --> 00:54:07,940
- You think that we're the bullies?
- Accurate.

803
00:54:07,983 --> 00:54:10,595
We didn't make you a loser.
Your mom did.

804
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:12,684
- It's in your blood, babe.
- Genetics.

805
00:54:12,727 --> 00:54:14,468
So, you might as well
just kill yourself.

806
00:54:14,512 --> 00:54:16,078
I'm sure she probably
won't even care,

807
00:54:16,122 --> 00:54:18,080
and you know,
at least you'll be famous.

808
00:54:18,124 --> 00:54:19,256
Bye!

809
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,124
I'm done.

810
00:55:03,256 --> 00:55:04,083
I quit.

811
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:12,265
It's over when I say it's over.

812
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:10,497
You know what's expected of you.

813
00:56:16,285 --> 00:56:19,201
I'm not interested
in any of that trivial crap.

814
00:56:19,245 --> 00:56:21,900
Can you tell me something
about your future, your career,

815
00:56:21,943 --> 00:56:26,774
something that I would be
interested in.

816
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,478
By your words
you shall be justified,

817
00:56:34,521 --> 00:56:36,697
by your words
you shall be condemned.

818
00:58:03,044 --> 00:58:07,788
Don't be like your father.

819
00:58:16,275 --> 00:58:18,928
Can you do something about that lipstick?
It makes you look like a hooker.

820
00:58:22,629 --> 00:58:24,936
One wrong word
can lead a client to jail.

821
00:58:24,979 --> 00:58:29,897
One wrong word
can lead a client to jail.

822
00:58:37,383 --> 00:58:44,390
One wrong word
can change your life forever.

823
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:47,306
...forever.

824
00:58:48,089 --> 00:58:49,221
...forever.

825
00:59:25,953 --> 00:59:27,607
Okay, girls, we're ready to begin.

826
00:59:29,043 --> 00:59:31,350
Hi there. How are you?
What's your name?

827
00:59:31,393 --> 00:59:33,744
- Marie Carter. Senior.
- Marie Carter.

828
00:59:33,787 --> 00:59:36,660
Senior? How are you?
Here you go. Good luck.

829
00:59:36,703 --> 00:59:38,444
Please take a picture. Next.

830
00:59:40,141 --> 00:59:42,840
- Hi there, what's your name?
- Trish Malone, Junior.

831
00:59:42,883 --> 00:59:43,951
Get your picture taken, please.

832
00:59:43,971 --> 00:59:45,669
You know, I got it by memory.

833
00:59:45,712 --> 00:59:46,626
Next.

834
00:59:47,845 --> 00:59:49,542
- Can you hear me?
- Lori, you're so cute.

835
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,978
Don't listen to her.

836
00:59:51,022 --> 00:59:52,632
I like it. There you go.
Good luck.

837
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:53,744
Get your picture taken.
Next! Smile.

838
00:59:53,764 --> 00:59:55,374
Don't listen to her!

839
00:59:56,941 --> 00:59:58,159
Hello?

840
01:00:00,727 --> 01:00:03,991
- Hi, Julie Klein. Sophomore.
- Turn around, Julie.

841
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:07,908
Okay, you'll do. Great.
Here you go. Good luck.

842
01:00:07,952 --> 01:00:10,171
- Read it over, have your parents sign it.
- Thank you. Next.

843
01:00:11,129 --> 01:00:12,391
I said next!

844
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,221
Don't do it.
Give her the application.

845
01:00:17,135 --> 01:00:18,397
Hi...

846
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,051
Elle Wurthmore. Freshman.

847
01:00:23,402 --> 01:00:24,490
Hello?

848
01:00:24,533 --> 01:00:26,492
What the hell is that on her face?

849
01:00:26,535 --> 01:00:27,406
Shut up!

850
01:00:27,449 --> 01:00:29,016
Elle, is it?

851
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,061
Elle Wurthmore.

852
01:00:30,104 --> 01:00:31,236
I know you can hear me.

853
01:00:31,279 --> 01:00:33,978
Give her the application.

854
01:00:34,021 --> 01:00:35,719
I'm sorry. We reached our limit.

855
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:37,372
Give her the God damn application.

856
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:38,678
Wurthmore?

857
01:00:38,722 --> 01:00:39,897
Don't say it!

858
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,376
More like Wurth-less.

859
01:02:55,336 --> 01:02:58,513
By your words
you shall be justified,

860
01:02:59,123 --> 01:03:02,604
by your words
you shall be condemned.

861
01:03:06,304 --> 01:03:10,221
Can't you do anything right?
You never fail to disappoint me.

862
01:03:10,264 --> 01:03:12,614
How many times
do I have to tell you?

863
01:03:13,572 --> 01:03:15,139
Are you serious?

864
01:03:15,182 --> 01:03:16,990
You aren't at all
how I thought you'd be.

865
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:18,426
You're going to have
to suck it up.

866
01:03:18,446 --> 01:03:19,883
Why are you the way you are?

867
01:03:19,926 --> 01:03:21,536
What's wrong with you?

868
01:03:22,973 --> 01:03:24,801
You're gonna have to try harder.

869
01:03:25,323 --> 01:03:27,020
You make us look like failures.

870
01:03:27,978 --> 01:03:29,544
You can't be that worthless.

871
01:03:29,588 --> 01:03:31,265
Why can't you be
more like your sister.

872
01:03:31,285 --> 01:03:33,157
- What's wrong with you.
- Shut up!

873
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,507
- This is the best you can do?
- Shut up!

874
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,335
- Shut up!
- Look at you.

875
01:03:37,378 --> 01:03:39,728
Please.

876
01:03:39,772 --> 01:03:41,406
When are you gonna live up to your
potential? Don't stop until you win.

877
01:03:41,426 --> 01:03:42,886
You're worthless.
You're worthless.

878
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:45,038
I'm sorry!

879
01:04:07,495 --> 01:04:09,889
I'm so sorry.

880
01:04:17,897 --> 01:04:19,072
What is my name?

881
01:04:21,335 --> 01:04:22,902
It's Elle, right?

882
01:04:23,729 --> 01:04:25,383
Elle what?

883
01:04:26,906 --> 01:04:28,125
Wurthmore.

884
01:04:31,693 --> 01:04:32,956
I don't know.

885
01:04:34,131 --> 01:04:37,569
- Everyone thought that you...
- I killed myself?

886
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,441
No.

887
01:04:40,485 --> 01:04:42,922
I didn't kill myself.

888
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:44,489
You killed me.

889
01:04:44,532 --> 01:04:47,361
Over and over and over again.

890
01:04:48,623 --> 01:04:52,192
All I ever wanted
was to be accepted.

891
01:04:53,193 --> 01:04:55,892
I used to imagine
what life would be like

892
01:04:56,718 --> 01:04:59,243
to be a part
of the cheerleading squad

893
01:05:01,506 --> 01:05:03,464
and the day of the tryouts,

894
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:08,252
I rehearsed for hours
and hours on end.

895
01:05:08,295 --> 01:05:10,689
A simple hello
would've made my day.

896
01:05:13,866 --> 01:05:14,954
"Worthless".

897
01:05:17,696 --> 01:05:19,959
I got "worthless".

898
01:05:22,309 --> 01:05:24,529
My life has been turned
upside down.

899
01:05:25,312 --> 01:05:28,054
I died because of you.

900
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:35,757
I'm so sorry.

901
01:05:38,673 --> 01:05:40,937
How does this make you feel?

902
01:05:52,426 --> 01:05:54,385
This is the choice you made.

903
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:09,617
I'm egotistical, I'm self-centered,
and I'm a bully.

904
01:06:10,227 --> 01:06:15,972
In high school, it's supposed to be
some of the best memories of your life

905
01:06:16,711 --> 01:06:22,239
and I know that I've ruined
them for a lot of you people.

906
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:25,693
Talia, hey, it's Nikki.

907
01:07:25,737 --> 01:07:28,653
I know you didn't get in
'til like 3 AM or something,

908
01:07:28,696 --> 01:07:30,307
but there's no way
you're still sleeping

909
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:32,961
so, can you just please
pick up the phone?

910
01:07:33,005 --> 01:07:36,269
Leah's left like four messages
and she's flipping out.

911
01:07:37,488 --> 01:07:38,315
Hello?

912
01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:42,796
Okay, well whatever. We're gonna be
there in like 20 minutes anyway.

913
01:07:43,276 --> 01:07:44,277
Bye.

914
01:08:24,622 --> 01:08:25,449
Hello?

915
01:08:26,058 --> 01:08:27,190
Hey, what's up, Jim?

916
01:08:28,452 --> 01:08:30,149
Sorry to hear that.

917
01:08:30,193 --> 01:08:32,020
So, obviously,
you're not gonna make it.

918
01:08:33,021 --> 01:08:35,111
I completely understand.

919
01:08:35,154 --> 01:08:38,026
Listen, my granddaughter Abby's
picking me up any minute now

920
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:41,247
and I still have to learn the speech
that she wrote for me.

921
01:08:42,248 --> 01:08:45,121
Alright, we'll take care of everything
down at work. Don't worry about it.

922
01:08:45,164 --> 01:08:47,166
Alright, I gotta run.

923
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:48,950
Alright, bye-bye.

924
01:08:48,994 --> 01:08:49,821
Pap?

925
01:08:51,301 --> 01:08:52,650
What are you doing?

926
01:08:52,693 --> 01:08:54,086
It's 12:37.

927
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,435
Grandma's already left.

928
01:08:57,002 --> 01:08:58,505
Have you even looked over
the speech that I wrote for you?

929
01:08:58,525 --> 01:09:00,658
Yeah, I have everything
right here.

930
01:09:00,701 --> 01:09:04,052
Yeah, I can see that you have them,
but have you read them?

931
01:09:04,096 --> 01:09:06,054
Well, I looked at everything.

932
01:09:06,098 --> 01:09:08,840
Can't I just say
what I want to say?

933
01:09:08,883 --> 01:09:11,364
And can't you just allow me to...

934
01:09:11,408 --> 01:09:13,105
Alright. Alright.

935
01:09:13,758 --> 01:09:14,672
Thank you.

936
01:09:16,456 --> 01:09:18,676
You know you get that
from your grand mom.

937
01:09:19,807 --> 01:09:21,157
Let's go.

938
01:09:26,814 --> 01:09:28,120
Come on.

939
01:09:28,599 --> 01:09:29,861
Foundation color.

940
01:09:30,383 --> 01:09:31,689
Much more suitable.

941
01:09:37,434 --> 01:09:38,261
Okay.

942
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,005
Pap.

943
01:09:46,051 --> 01:09:47,270
Like your grandmother.

944
01:09:59,282 --> 01:10:00,196
One more time?

945
01:10:03,111 --> 01:10:05,940
I think I got the first part down.

946
01:10:12,643 --> 01:10:18,562
What is it that makes someone
feel so lost and alone

947
01:10:18,605 --> 01:10:24,394
that they would take
their own life?

948
01:10:25,351 --> 01:10:26,744
What are you trying to do?

949
01:10:26,787 --> 01:10:28,224
Butcher my speech?

950
01:10:30,443 --> 01:10:31,357
I'm sorry.

951
01:10:33,272 --> 01:10:34,360
I should've done more.

952
01:10:36,275 --> 01:10:39,496
We had the best doctors,
had the best medication...

953
01:10:40,323 --> 01:10:41,193
Stop.

954
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:45,328
Just stop, will you?

955
01:10:47,025 --> 01:10:50,942
Every year, I have to hear
the same thing again and again.

956
01:10:53,161 --> 01:10:56,252
None of us knew what was going
on in my mom's head.

957
01:10:57,862 --> 01:10:59,255
We did try.

958
01:11:00,081 --> 01:11:02,606
And she did have the best doctors

959
01:11:02,649 --> 01:11:06,914
and she was on every medication
that she could've been.

960
01:11:09,917 --> 01:11:12,920
And I was the one that found her.

961
01:11:15,314 --> 01:11:16,750
Not you, remember?

962
01:11:16,794 --> 01:11:18,665
I found my mom.

963
01:11:30,895 --> 01:11:37,118
I run one of the most successful
anti-bullying

964
01:11:37,162 --> 01:11:42,428
and suicide prevention organizations
in the world because of her.

965
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:46,954
Stop beating yourself up

966
01:11:46,998 --> 01:11:50,001
and look around
at what she did for us

967
01:11:50,044 --> 01:11:52,308
instead of what she did to us.

968
01:11:58,401 --> 01:11:59,750
I love you.

969
01:12:04,537 --> 01:12:06,452
The car's outside.

970
01:12:07,758 --> 01:12:10,151
Here, I have to go grab
a few things

971
01:12:10,195 --> 01:12:13,285
but we'll go over this again
in the car before we get there.

972
01:12:13,938 --> 01:12:15,418
You're gonna do great.

973
01:12:15,461 --> 01:12:16,332
Got it?

974
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,290
Good.

975
01:12:22,468 --> 01:12:23,687
Let's go, Pap.

976
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:27,081
You can do this.

977
01:12:27,952 --> 01:12:29,345
Everybody's counting on you.
