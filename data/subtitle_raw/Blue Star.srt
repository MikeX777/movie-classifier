1
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,341
Hey, catch the ball.

2
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,504
That's like it!

3
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:05,451
Hey, Ranjith!

4
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:06,692
Can you see the relay?

5
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:07,743
Are you able to watch?

6
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:09,552
Moron, I have to take a shower.

7
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:11,678
Bloody mug-face!
Stop yelling continuously.

8
00:03:11,785 --> 00:03:13,321
-Sister, please bear with me.-Don't' shake the antenna.

9
00:03:13,346 --> 00:03:14,628
Hey, Aathur woman.

10
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,710
My boy has been begging to you.

11
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:19,159
What's the hurry?
Why can't you take a shower later?

12
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:21,055
Hey, old hag. Let Susila akka come...

13
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:21,938
-I'll tell her about this.-Hold it right there.

14
00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:24,352
-Susila is not a Queen of England.
-Granny...

15
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:25,685
-I can handle her.
-...please stay calm!

16
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:27,607
Calling me an old hag!

17
00:03:27,884 --> 00:03:30,107
As if you are young lady...

18
00:03:30,203 --> 00:03:31,748
-...and we're holding your youth.-Granny, calm down.

19
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:33,203
Make the run.

20
00:03:33,337 --> 00:03:34,633
Hey, hold the antenna!

21
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:37,703
-Some sons I have, I say.-Hey, hold it right there!

22
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:40,118
Laying all day in the house is useless,
with no jobs.

23
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:40,860
Get down from the roof!

24
00:03:40,977 --> 00:03:42,907
Bloody! You would've hurt yourself.

25
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:44,368
Always watching TV.

26
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:45,396
-Hey!-Stop chiding only me.

27
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:46,709
-You don't question the eldest.
-Get lost!

28
00:03:46,891 --> 00:03:49,024
Ma, how many times should I ask you
to get cable TV?

29
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:50,477
Of course, you see money is raining.

30
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:53,234
Children of God should not watch TV.

31
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,383
I don't have fifty rupees per month
to waste on cable TV.

32
00:03:55,493 --> 00:03:57,516
Ma, it's best you get cable TV.

33
00:03:57,587 --> 00:03:58,836
I can't be holding the antenna
on the roof.

34
00:03:58,891 --> 00:03:59,898
I don't care about it.

35
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:01,078
I'm not the help in this house.

36
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,844
Hey, you too watch the match.

37
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:04,664
Hey, you'd know if you climb the roof.

38
00:04:04,696 --> 00:04:06,216
-Eh?
-You don't even tell me the score.

39
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,883
The roof can't bear my weight.

40
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:09,471
As if you're Mike Tyson!

41
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:11,368
Why can't you get cable for the house?

42
00:04:11,423 --> 00:04:13,711
I will bear the charges
from my pension money.

43
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,946
Listen, I've told you many times.

44
00:04:16,016 --> 00:04:18,102
Don't you dare interfere
when I'm disciplining them?

45
00:04:18,195 --> 00:04:20,552
They never touch the books.

46
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:22,125
Whether it's inside or outside the house...

47
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,993
All they care is about cricket.

48
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:26,789
I keep tearing them down,
and you keep putting up posters.

49
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:27,883
I will continue to tear them down.

50
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,125
One day, I will break the bat
and use it as firewood.

51
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:31,430
This is a challenge from Children of God.

52
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,362
[sings "Unnai Paartha" - Kadhal Mannan]

53
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,388
-Amma!-What is it?

54
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:31,373
Please come over here.

55
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:34,864
What is it?

56
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:36,732
I think it's going to rain.

57
00:05:36,787 --> 00:05:38,404
Ask Kamatachi to bring down
the clothes from the terrace.

58
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:43,047
Kamatchi!

59
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:44,677
It's going to rain.

60
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,215
Go and bring down the clothes.

61
00:05:55,844 --> 00:05:56,489
Get lost!

62
00:05:57,463 --> 00:05:59,880
Hey, Kavitha, please come with me.

63
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:01,419
Get lost!

64
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:14,642
Yours Truly,
Sachin Rajesh

65
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,167
Kamatchi, did you see my Maths notebook?

66
00:06:30,863 --> 00:06:33,253
It's surprising to see you look for books.

67
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:34,876
You see...

68
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:37,611
Tomorrow the teacher won't be
coming to the class.

69
00:06:39,527 --> 00:06:41,643
So, he asked me
to teach the class tomorrow.

70
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,432
I have to prepare for it.

71
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,378
My brother is a Maths genius!

72
00:06:49,705 --> 00:06:50,448
Oh!

73
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:55,020
He's very fluent with "Two" tables.

74
00:06:56,017 --> 00:06:58,837
Rajesh, why don't you teach Kavitha too?

75
00:06:59,049 --> 00:07:00,213
Poor thing does not know anything.

76
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:05,018
I'll have my revenge when you get caught
with your boyfriend.

77
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:08,471
My brother is not good at Maths.

78
00:07:08,972 --> 00:07:11,495
But he's an amazing at cricket.

79
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,464
He just not plays the sport.
He plays it to win!

80
00:07:14,737 --> 00:07:16,579
He'd do anything to win.

81
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:18,833
He's a cricket fanatic!

82
00:07:19,587 --> 00:07:22,626
But yeah... he's a little crazy!

83
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:44,833
Is the bus late today?

84
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:46,482
Brother, drop me at the SR gate.

85
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:47,638
They don't seem to get caught.

86
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:50,427
-Machi, that girl is checking you out.
-I'm checking her out too.

87
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:15,115
â™ª Step aside, my dear â™ª

88
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:16,317
â™ª If brushed against,
Fire will catch on â™ª

89
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:17,130
â™ª Taking the opportunity â™ª

90
00:08:17,155 --> 00:08:19,155
â™ª We boys want to show off
With swag! â™ª

â™ª We are Arakkonam folks â™ª

94

â™ª The sassy folks you see at the market
Are my people â™ª

95
00:08:24,948 --> 00:08:26,513
â™ª Welcome, my Chief
Take a seat â™ª

96
00:08:26,557 --> 00:08:27,779
â™ª We gonna throw the ball
Strike it â™ª

97
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:29,181
â™ª Show your might â™ª

98
00:08:29,216 --> 00:08:30,798
â™ª If someone troubles
Give them back â™ª

100
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:33,578
â™ª Show them your brawn â™ª

101

â™ª Show them who you are
They cannot ignore you â™ª

102
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:42,773
Hey, stop the car.

103
00:08:43,062 --> 00:08:45,397
We must clear this ground and level it.

104
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:47,726
The former owner has been
fooling people...

105
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,927
into thinking the land belongs
to the temple.

106
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,787
We should keep up the charade!

107
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,302
Do you see the bullock cart?

108
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,226
-From that point till here.
-Fine, work up the deal.

109
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,805
â™ª Cross your legs and sit
You belong to the clan of Ravana â™ª

â™ª It is time you rise
Do it right away â™ª

111
00:09:13,614 --> 00:09:16,493
â™ª We are gonna stand on the roof

â™ª Let us dance to the music â™ª

117
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:35,906
It's okay you continue.
I'll wait for you.

118
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:37,250
Tomorrow I need to come early.

119
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,001
-What time will she come out?
-It's time!

120
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,837
-What's your name?
-Thaenmozhi!

121
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,140
-Your name?
-Anandhi!

122
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:44,070
-Where do you live?
-Perumbachai!

123
00:09:44,546 --> 00:09:45,842
Do you know Ranjith?

124
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:46,899
I know him!

125
00:09:47,017 --> 00:09:48,517
That Anna is an amazing guy.

126
00:09:48,626 --> 00:09:50,735
Whenever he rides the bus,
we have fun!

127
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:52,188
Give my regards to Ranjith.

128
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:53,922
Okay!

129
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:01,567
Machi... Hmm....

130
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:02,776
â™ª Step aside â™ª

131
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:03,447
â™ª Step aside â™ª

132
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:04,739
â™ª Step aside I say â™ª

133
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:05,638
â™ª Step aside â™ª

134
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:06,248
â™ª Step aside â™ª

135
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:07,450
â™ª Step aside I say â™ª

136
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:10,541
-Here, take it.
-Ma, this is atrocious!

137

â™ª We are the mighty ones
Don't you challenge Blue Star â™ª

â™ª We are the mighty ones
Don't you challenge Blue Star â™ª

139
00:10:19,294 --> 00:10:20,485
â™ª Come on. Throw the ball â™ª

140
00:10:20,546 --> 00:10:21,786
â™ª You shouldn't indulge â™ª

141
00:10:22,174 --> 00:10:25,088
â™ª We'll skin you upside down
Off you go â™ª

142
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,276
-Hurry up!
-Anna, 100 grams for me.

143
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,002
-Hey, we'll go inside and eat.
-Hey, hide it well.

144
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:35,735
â™ª Where's Arakkonam?
Right here! â™ª

145
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:38,106
â™ª Where's Arakkonam?

â™ª Hey, train to Madras
We're important people â™ª

156
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,419
â™ª If we pick head,
We get tail â™ª

157
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,649
â™ª This is Arakkonam style-u â™ª

Hey, Paruthi, I told you to bowl offside.

168
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:30,948
You never pay heed to me.

169
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,846
I get you.
But I don't know to bowl offside.

170

00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,412
Vivaan!

173
00:12:05,655 --> 00:12:06,859
Your body alignment is off!

174
00:12:07,153 --> 00:12:09,057
Your body alignment should be
in line with your leg.

175
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,784
Are you cow herders?

176
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,590
Don't you have any sense?

177
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,042
This is last warning!

178
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,088
Bowl well.

179
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:25,981
If you continue to play this way...

180
00:12:26,552 --> 00:12:28,427
Under 16 district level...

181
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:29,926
No!

182
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:56,619
That was a super ball!

183
00:12:56,785 --> 00:12:58,463
You bowl well!

184
00:13:04,848 --> 00:13:06,729
-Are you a cow herder?
-No, sir.

185
00:13:07,012 --> 00:13:08,747
I'll throw you out!
Understand?

186
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:09,862
Don't you have any sense?

187
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,006
If you continue to bowl this way...

188
00:13:12,184 --> 00:13:13,760
I will throw you out!

189
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:14,468
Got that!

190
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,335
Son, come over here.

191
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:20,341
Your body alignment is not
the issue; you bowled a wide.

192
00:13:20,825 --> 00:13:21,887
It's in the right posture.

193
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,868
When you release the ball
your bowling arm is wavering.

194
00:13:27,636 --> 00:13:29,099
How do I fix it?

195
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:33,340
Your bowling arm is natural.

196
00:13:34,443 --> 00:13:35,778
So don't worry about it.

197
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:40,414
How do we use the non-bowling arm?

198
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:42,394
To aim!

199
00:13:43,092 --> 00:13:45,648
If you sharply aim the stumps...

200
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,310
When you release the ball,

201
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:51,013
your non-bowling arm should follow
the bowling arm.

202
00:13:52,262 --> 00:13:52,918
Like this!

203
00:13:54,098 --> 00:13:54,715
Like this!

204
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:57,356
Okay?

205
00:13:58,526 --> 00:13:59,394
Understood?

206
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:04,278
-That was a super ball!
-You bowl well!

207
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:13,785
Hey!

208
00:14:14,989 --> 00:14:17,371
Hey, I've been waiting for you.

209
00:14:17,513 --> 00:14:18,551
-Give it to me.
-Let go!

210
00:14:21,388 --> 00:14:22,076
What happened?

211
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,187
You completely ignored me!

212
00:14:24,786 --> 00:14:26,168
Like you didn't notice me at the station.

213
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:29,747
Hey, I was discussing the match
with the boys.

214
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,006
So I didn't realize it.

215
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:34,068
Why don't you talk to me
about cricket?

216
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:51,488
It's not like I don't watch cricket.

217
00:14:52,706 --> 00:14:54,519
Since childhood I've been watching cricket.

218
00:14:54,598 --> 00:14:55,207
Is it?

219
00:14:56,114 --> 00:14:56,731
Out!

220
00:14:57,488 --> 00:14:58,753
Fine, tell me,
who's your favourite player?

221
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:02,067
I like Chris Gaines.

222
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:05,273
So, you do watch cricket!

223
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:08,192
Why do you sound surprised
at anything I say?

224
00:15:09,086 --> 00:15:11,214
Is cricket reserved only for boys
to watch and play?

225
00:15:11,325 --> 00:15:13,528
-I did not mean it that way.
-Please explain then!

226
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:18,018
You'd know a woman's prowess
if you let us play cricket.

227
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:26,723
Why do you like Chris Gaines?

228
00:15:26,865 --> 00:15:28,153
More than a batsman and a bowler...

229
00:15:28,456 --> 00:15:30,323
I like the all-rounder the best!

230
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,184
You don't say!

231
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:33,778
I'm an all-rounder, too, Anandhi!

232
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,942
That's why I like you a lot!

233
00:15:36,513 --> 00:15:37,013
Hey!

234
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:41,035
What?

235
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:43,427
You called me a...

236
00:15:45,148 --> 00:15:47,303
Don't speak like this in front
of my Amma.

237
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:50,230
Listen, I can't watch my mouth.

238
00:15:50,853 --> 00:15:53,195
I speak my heart.
And I have no regrets.

239
00:15:53,778 --> 00:15:56,466
My dear, it's your mouth and your wish.

240
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,200
You speak your heart!

241
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,898
But my Amma is way above you.

242
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:02,873
Hell's going to break loose.

243
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:16,752
Have you ever watched me play?

244
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:18,964
I have seen you play.

245
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:23,320
You run fast after hitting the ball
like Michael Bevan.

246
00:16:24,796 --> 00:16:25,515
Hey!

247
00:16:26,268 --> 00:16:27,112
It's fun to watch!

248
00:16:33,114 --> 00:16:35,676
Tell me something.
Why do you like to be a keeper?

249
00:16:35,926 --> 00:16:38,504
A keeper has a clear view of the ground.

250
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,090
When a new batsman arrives
and taps the bat on the ground...

251
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:44,910
I can judge in which direction
he's going to bat.

252
00:16:45,122 --> 00:16:47,110
Based on that I'll change the fielding
and bowling line up.

253
00:16:47,822 --> 00:16:49,822
That's why I like to be the wicket keeper.

254
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:51,183
It's fun!

255
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:57,059
I'll inform when I play at Welfare School.

256
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:57,957
Would you like to come and watch?

257
00:16:58,732 --> 00:16:59,880
As if I'd get permission.

258
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:03,551
Even if you play for Indian team...

259
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:05,903
I can only watch you play on the TV.

260
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,184
You're going to play at the
playground in the next town.

261
00:17:10,473 --> 00:17:11,887
I won't get a chance to watch.

262
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:15,481
Listen, Ranjith...

263
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,692
do you wish to play for Indian team?

264
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:19,535
I have better business to tend to.

265
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,266
I want to play for our town.

266
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,024
-It's a long story.
-What? Tell me.

267
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:32,562
Every week on Sunday my mother
will take me to the church.

268
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:37,166
But my heart will only yearn to
play cricket at the playground.

269
00:17:37,716 --> 00:17:41,554
Every year, during the temple carnival,
they organize a cricket tournament.

270
00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:45,099
In that tournament, our team Blue Star...

271
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:48,504
versus town's team Alpha
is a huge match to look for.

272
00:17:49,054 --> 00:17:51,349
Are you folks ready?
Please chant with me!

273
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:56,851
Because this match is considered
equal to the India-Pakistan match.

274
00:17:56,935 --> 00:17:58,153
It will be sensational!

275
00:18:01,356 --> 00:18:03,293
The match fell on a Sunday.

276
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,308
Hey, look to the front.

277
00:18:04,388 --> 00:18:05,153
And I was stuck in the church.

278
00:18:05,286 --> 00:18:06,965
And I was a substitute in the match.

279
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:11,593
When they asked everyone
to close their eyes to pray...

280
00:18:12,606 --> 00:18:15,215
"Hey, Ranjith, now is the time."

281
00:18:15,466 --> 00:18:17,934
"Get up and run."
And I ran to the playground.

282
00:18:18,739 --> 00:18:19,215
Hey!

283
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:21,670
My brother, too, followed me.

284
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,254
If you ask me cricket or Jesus?

285
00:18:29,684 --> 00:18:33,552
I pray to Jesus that Blue Star team
should win the match.

286
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:36,598
On that day the ground was
swarming with people.

287
00:18:37,301 --> 00:18:40,957
The Alpha Boys who always feel
they're above us...

288
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:42,614
When it comes to cricket...

289
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,328
every time they taste defeat.

290
00:18:45,981 --> 00:18:48,437
The main reason for it is Emmanuel Anna.

291
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:51,817
The reason why I am crazy about cricket...

292
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,820
I would say
it's because of Emmanuel Anna.

293
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:57,687
Not just me...

294
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:01,052
But boys from neighboring towns
and cities...

295
00:19:01,328 --> 00:19:03,365
love the game of Emmanuel Anna.

296
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:11,871
He's our Kapil Dev,
Vivian Richards and everything.

297
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:13,563
His game is fantastic!

298
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:16,126
The wickets were raining down.

299
00:19:16,701 --> 00:19:18,998
Kaali Anna was hurt on that day.

300
00:19:19,466 --> 00:19:21,711
As I was a substitute
they sent me in to play.

301
00:19:21,982 --> 00:19:24,405
At first, I was very nervous.

302
00:19:24,554 --> 00:19:25,556
I could not play.

303
00:19:25,922 --> 00:19:27,188
Emmanuel Anna came to me...

304
00:19:27,341 --> 00:19:28,817
He asked me not to fear.

305
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:31,043
He asked me to play stroke
and he'll handle the rest.

306
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,908
His words of wisdom gave me courage.

307
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:36,827
And I started to play.

308
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:40,223
I was running to score a run...

309
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:41,772
I got run out.

310
00:19:43,396 --> 00:19:44,973
I was full of tears.

311
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,421
But he never complained.

312
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,410
Instead he came and appreciated my game...

313
00:19:51,687 --> 00:19:52,976
and gave me a pat on my shoulder.

314
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:53,613
Awesome!

315
00:19:57,379 --> 00:20:01,511
Gopalan was anxious
that Emmanuel would win again.

316
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,176
He wanted to win this match
at any cost.

317
00:20:06,765 --> 00:20:09,402
Last two balls
and we need six runs to win.

318
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:10,828
And it's the last wicket.

319
00:20:11,114 --> 00:20:12,625
The bowler bowled the ball.

320
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,492
Emmanuel Anna played an amazing shot.

321
00:20:19,848 --> 00:20:21,652
The ball was flying high in the air.

322
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,027
Everyone is looking at the ball.

323
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,726
Vinayagam fielded in straight
and caught the ball.

324
00:20:25,852 --> 00:20:27,672
But he stepped on the boundary
while he caught the ball.

325
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:29,155
All of us saw him step on the boundary.

326
00:20:29,557 --> 00:20:30,631
He too knew it.

327
00:20:30,922 --> 00:20:33,971
-Out! Out!-But he swore he did not step on it.

328
00:20:34,348 --> 00:20:36,121
The entire crowd is saying it's Out.

329
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:37,937
But our team said it's a six!

330
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,776
The umpire was clueless.

331
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:43,135
If the umpire says it's Out,
the colony folks will fight.

332
00:20:43,316 --> 00:20:45,316
And if he gives it a six,
the village folks will fight.

333
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,500
But the umpire went neutral...

334
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,173
and declared it dead ball.

335
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:53,694
Emmanuel Anna said he'll handle it
and stood in the ground.

336
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:55,693
But the Gopalan...

337
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,926
knew it's impossible to win
with Emmanuel

338
00:20:57,982 --> 00:20:59,429
and instigated a fight.

339
00:20:59,742 --> 00:21:01,956
He instigated a fight
and asked to beat them up.

340
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:04,294
And people from the other side
came running to fight.

341
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:06,559
On seeing it, our folks,
too, started to run.

342
00:21:06,672 --> 00:21:08,445
A huge fight broke out.

343
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:11,445
The village and the colony folks
fought each other.

344
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:19,531
In this riot,
Mani hacked Emmanuel Anna's leg.

345
00:21:20,603 --> 00:21:21,828
Don't spare anyone.
Beat them all.

346
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,345
Since that incident the two teams
were banned...

347
00:21:33,518 --> 00:21:36,626
to play against each other.
A written order was issued by the Police.

348
00:21:37,994 --> 00:21:40,968
After that, there was no cricket
tournament during the Temple carnival.

349
00:21:41,388 --> 00:21:44,317
Even if we play cricket on that ground,
it'll be at different times.

350
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:48,184
The team that first places the stone
on the ground can play.

351
00:21:48,502 --> 00:21:49,697
It does not matter who.

352
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:54,639
At present,
I'm the Captain of the Blue Star team.

353
00:21:57,715 --> 00:21:59,383
Rajesh is the captain of Alpha Boys.

354
00:22:00,075 --> 00:22:01,442
Rajesh is a good player.

355
00:22:02,161 --> 00:22:03,176
But he is quite weird.

356
00:22:03,903 --> 00:22:06,637
Alpha Boys claim to be
the best players in town.

357
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:07,707
I want to defeat them.

358
00:22:08,757 --> 00:22:10,692
We do play with other teams.

359
00:22:10,988 --> 00:22:14,159
Until now we both never played
against each other.

360
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:15,457
I'm waiting for that day.

361
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,281
I'm not getting a chance.
I'm waiting for the right chance.

362
00:22:18,644 --> 00:22:20,566
No matter where a match
is organized

363
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,122
they won't even prepare a chart
that involves us.

364
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:27,914
They claim as far as Emmanuel Anna leg
was fine Blue Star won...

365
00:22:28,106 --> 00:22:32,171
And they mock us everywhere we go.

366
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:36,132
The match where they hacked
Emmanuel Anna's leg...

367
00:22:36,617 --> 00:22:39,586
I want to play against them
in a Temple carnival's match...

368
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,881
And make them realize hacking
Emmanuel Anna's leg was wrong...

369
00:22:42,015 --> 00:22:44,031
Also, prove them Blue Star is still
a winning team...

370
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,280
...as a captain!

371
00:22:45,554 --> 00:22:47,562
I want to show them we're
the best team in Arakkonam.

372
00:22:47,851 --> 00:22:48,544
That's enough for me.

373
00:22:49,046 --> 00:22:51,530
Wait! When shall I teach you cricket?

374
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,435
Yeah, right! My folks won't approve.

375
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:56,570
It's not going to happen.

376
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,371
Shut up and leave!

377
00:22:58,539 --> 00:22:59,931
-Hey!-Too much you are.

378
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:01,196
Hey, Anandhi!

379
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:12,943
Ma!

380
00:23:13,764 --> 00:23:14,521
-Ma!
-What is it?

381
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:16,060
Why did he take my shirt?

382
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:17,544
-Oh, God!
-Does he not have a shirt?

383
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:20,412
I neatly wash and press my clothes.

384
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,717
And he wears them after my hard work.

385
00:23:22,085 --> 00:23:25,600
Hey, he's younger to you but keeps
his clothes washed and pressed.

386
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:26,858
You don't seem to change.

387
00:23:27,342 --> 00:23:29,427
Hey, it's your brother.
Let him use it.

388
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:30,795
He has two pairs of hands and legs.

389
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:32,209
-Too much!
-Step aside.

390
00:23:33,623 --> 00:23:34,693
One day I'll get you.

391
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:39,224
It's a never-ending fight for clothes
between you two.

392
00:23:39,475 --> 00:23:40,467
As if anything good comes out of it.

393
00:23:40,615 --> 00:23:43,958
If I see you both near the playground,
there is no food for you guys.

394
00:23:44,224 --> 00:23:47,084
Stop nagging the boys all the time.

395
00:23:47,303 --> 00:23:50,092
They never pray to the Lord.

396
00:23:50,186 --> 00:23:52,436
Only then will they be blessed with a
career in medicine or become a collector.

397
00:23:52,874 --> 00:23:54,990
No one in this house fear the God.

398
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,022
How often should I ask you to
get me a pot of water?

399
00:23:58,108 --> 00:23:58,967
You don't seem to move.

400
00:24:01,904 --> 00:24:02,442
Damn!

401
00:24:02,952 --> 00:24:04,952
It's best you stick to
what I asked you of.

402
00:24:05,022 --> 00:24:06,256
If I find out you were gawking
at women...

403
00:24:06,281 --> 00:24:08,740
-As if you'd spare me.
-Appa, get one for me too.

404
00:24:09,021 --> 00:24:10,561
All of you pile on chores for me.

405
00:24:10,756 --> 00:24:12,036
Some children I have.

406
00:24:17,382 --> 00:24:18,123
Susila!

407
00:24:19,428 --> 00:24:20,083
Susila!

408
00:24:23,185 --> 00:24:24,201
Why did he come here?

409
00:24:24,459 --> 00:24:27,388
Even a day late,
they send men home for collection.

410
00:24:34,114 --> 00:24:35,449
Do I have to remind you?

411
00:24:35,514 --> 00:24:37,880
My, Mama, sent for as you did not
pay last month's interest.

412
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:39,568
I missed my payment this month.

413
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,622
I'll pay you next month without fail.

414
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:42,263
You have an excuse every month.

415
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:45,037
You know to borrow money
but don't pay on time.

416
00:24:45,106 --> 00:24:47,715
I'm facing a crunch this month.
I'll pay you next month.

417
00:24:47,771 --> 00:24:49,841
I'll be back tomorrow.
It's best you pay up.

418
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,316
I will pay up!

419
00:24:55,302 --> 00:24:56,333
Why are you glaring?

420
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:59,443
Ma, why did you borrow from him?

421
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,865
In this area, no one else
is ready to lend money.

422
00:25:01,897 --> 00:25:03,131
Ma, how much did you borrow?

423
00:25:03,662 --> 00:25:04,763
It's mere one thousand rupees.

424
00:25:04,842 --> 00:25:07,982
I consolidated the previous petty loans
and borrowed from him.

425
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:08,772
But you see...

426
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:10,021
Ma!

427
00:25:11,864 --> 00:25:14,068
Month end the scholarship money
will be credited.

428
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,279
Pay him with that money.

429
00:25:15,358 --> 00:25:18,615
Hey, I have to pay donation to church
with the scholarship money.

430
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:21,646
Stop glaring and go take a bath.

431
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:22,818
The water is getting cold.

432
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:39,758
What happened?
Why do you have a long face?

433
00:25:48,383 --> 00:25:49,313
I have mentioned earlier...

434
00:25:50,463 --> 00:25:51,407
about Rajesh!

435
00:25:53,915 --> 00:25:56,423
I think my mother took a loan from him.

436
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:06,039
He came home....

437
00:26:07,564 --> 00:26:08,923
and called my mother by her name.

438
00:26:12,945 --> 00:26:14,093
He is as old as me.

439
00:26:28,134 --> 00:26:29,032
How much do you owe him?

440
00:26:30,266 --> 00:26:31,578
I will give you my chain.

441
00:26:32,344 --> 00:26:34,787
You just replace it with a fake one.

442
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,320
I'll manage.

443
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,449
Thank you for asking though.

444
00:26:45,281 --> 00:26:46,843
Why can't you keep smiling?

445
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:49,726
But you keep a sour face like Dravid.

446
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,702
Hey, don't you have any sense?

447
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:04,446
Why are you being close with him?

448
00:27:04,672 --> 00:27:07,164
Is this why you deck up in the morning
to meet him?

449
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,529
Aren't you ashamed?

450
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:10,774
Why are you yelling at me?

451
00:27:11,271 --> 00:27:12,852
I know how to carry myself.
You shut up!

452
00:27:12,962 --> 00:27:14,720
-Ranjith, look.
-I'm talking to you!

453
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:17,048
Hey, Anandhi, you better listen to me.

454
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:19,173
Stop! Shall I tell your parents?

455
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:20,592
Go ahead! I'll handle it.

456
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:22,170
-I'm talking to you...
-Hey, what's your problem?

457
00:27:22,665 --> 00:27:25,782
Hey, I'm speaking to my cousin.
What's to you?

458
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:28,351
-Get lost!
-How dare you push me?

459
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:30,740
Pipe down!

460
00:27:31,505 --> 00:27:33,055
Hey, get lost!

461
00:27:33,704 --> 00:27:34,912
You made a mistake by hitting me.

462
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:37,047
Stay right here! I'll mess you up!

463
00:27:37,118 --> 00:27:38,125
Hey, get lost!

464
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:47,067
Anandhi, come on, let's go.

465
00:27:50,608 --> 00:27:51,569
You go ahead. I'll follow.

466
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,310
Hey, how come they're playing?

467
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:36,471
I have no idea.

468
00:28:37,902 --> 00:28:39,183
Why the hell are they playing?

469
00:28:39,924 --> 00:28:41,057
Did you place the stone last night?

470
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:42,162
Hey, Ravi!

471
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:43,762
I did place the stone.

472
00:28:44,535 --> 00:28:46,370
What do they think of themselves?

473
00:28:48,206 --> 00:28:50,037
My uncle renovated this playground.

474
00:28:52,221 --> 00:28:53,838
-Hey!
-Looks like they're planning a meeting.

475
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:55,066
Why are you people playing now?

476
00:28:55,222 --> 00:28:55,941
What's the matter?

477
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:58,371
They placed the stone first
and claim to play first.

478
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,808
Hey, who threw away the stone?

479
00:29:01,121 --> 00:29:02,443
We placed it first!

480
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,417
You, people, threw it away
and kept your stone.

481
00:29:04,683 --> 00:29:06,542
-Hey, don't point fingers.
-What else do you want me to point?

482
00:29:07,108 --> 00:29:09,116
What the hell?
Can't you see we're talking?

483
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:10,580
You too talk!

484
00:29:11,536 --> 00:29:13,824
Don't act too smart!

485
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:15,106
I'll break your jaw!

486
00:29:15,161 --> 00:29:17,355
Hey, don't you understand?

487
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:19,355
We placed the stone first.

488
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,150
It's best you guys pack up and leave.

489
00:29:22,745 --> 00:29:23,580
-Before I lose it.
-Hey!

490
00:29:24,253 --> 00:29:26,565
-Didn't we place the stone first?
-Yes we did!

491
00:29:27,527 --> 00:29:28,370
Let them wait.

492
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,698
You threw away our stone...

493
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,881
You must've done it on purpose.

494
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:34,050
Fine, let's come to an agreement.

495
00:29:34,114 --> 00:29:35,246
Let flip a coin and decide.

496
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,613
Let's play three balls each team.

497
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:39,386
Whoever scores high...

498
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:40,715
they'll get play first on the ground.

499
00:29:41,004 --> 00:29:42,441
-You have a point.
-Okay?

500
00:29:44,346 --> 00:29:45,527
Rajesh, don't agree.

501
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:47,420
Hey, they're talking nonsense.

502
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:49,722
Hey! They're scared!

503
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:51,417
Look at them chicken out.

504
00:29:51,668 --> 00:29:52,956
-Hey!
-Look at their faces!

505
00:29:53,075 --> 00:29:54,863
Hey! Hey! Hey! Calm down!

506
00:29:54,948 --> 00:29:56,722
Calm down!
Obviously, they'll be scared.

507
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,040
-Poor thing!
-Hey, who said we're scared!

508
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,055
Flip the coin!

509
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:05,089
Tails!

510
00:30:06,003 --> 00:30:07,682
Heads! We choose batting.
Bring it on!

511
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:09,095
Hey, get lost!

512
00:30:09,378 --> 00:30:10,447
Hey, give me the bat!

513
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:12,815
I said give me the bat.

514
00:30:12,885 --> 00:30:13,564
Don't spare them.

515
00:30:13,643 --> 00:30:14,956
-This is our chance to beat them.
-I'm going to ram them!

516
00:30:15,074 --> 00:30:16,230
I'll show them the prowess of Alpha boys!

517
00:30:16,286 --> 00:30:17,206
Hey, bring me the bat!

518
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:21,714
Hey, we'll handle them.

519
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:28,699
Awesome Anna.
Let's play.

520
00:30:31,698 --> 00:30:32,943
Here you go, Sam.

521
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,240
Come on, Sam!

522
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:43,143
Come on! Come on, bowl!

523
00:30:43,706 --> 00:30:45,769
Come on, bowl, Sam.

524
00:30:47,121 --> 00:30:47,632
Bowl!

525
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:54,606
Damn!

526
00:30:54,674 --> 00:30:55,644
Hey, catch it.

527
00:30:56,003 --> 00:30:58,191
Super! Super, Rajesh! Well played.

528
00:30:58,313 --> 00:30:58,988
Hey!

529
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:03,770
-Get lost!
-We'll get him in the next ball.

530
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:08,723
Sam, don't get worked up.
Calmly bowl.

531
00:31:08,748 --> 00:31:09,664
We'll get them!

532
00:31:32,967 --> 00:31:34,434
Sam, that's good bowling!

533
00:31:38,627 --> 00:31:41,302
Good bowling! Sam! Sam!

534
00:31:54,052 --> 00:31:55,170
Machan, catch the ball.

535
00:31:58,891 --> 00:31:59,718
Damn!

536
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:05,310
Get lost!

537
00:32:08,608 --> 00:32:09,389
Yeah!

538
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:14,670
Machi, don't worry.
We'll make it.

539
00:32:15,124 --> 00:32:15,734
Yeah!

540
00:32:15,981 --> 00:32:17,685
8 runs in 3 balls.
How do we make it?

541
00:32:25,424 --> 00:32:26,049
Susila!

542
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,777
We have to make it.
If not, it'll be embarrassing.

543
00:32:29,826 --> 00:32:31,125
The match is not over yet.

544
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:41,429
Come on, Ranjith!

545
00:32:42,153 --> 00:32:43,459
Nail it brother!

546
00:32:45,803 --> 00:32:47,575
Come on, Ranjith.
You can do it!

547
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:48,944
Come on, Ranjith!

548
00:32:49,464 --> 00:32:50,323
Don't spare them!

549
00:32:50,465 --> 00:32:52,291
Hereafter, we'll be the first ones
to play on this ground.

550
00:32:53,188 --> 00:32:54,888
Come on, Rajesh!

551
00:32:56,869 --> 00:32:58,694
Come on! To this side.
To this side.

552
00:32:58,745 --> 00:33:00,285
That's about it. Perfect!

553
00:33:03,917 --> 00:33:06,119
Come on, Ranjith! Come on, Ranjith!

554
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,255
Come on!

555
00:33:25,484 --> 00:33:27,857
Come on! You can do it.
Don't worry.

556
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,047
-Oh, no!
-There goes your chance.

557
00:33:43,194 --> 00:33:44,558
Get out of the ground!

558
00:33:45,492 --> 00:33:46,781
Rajesh that was amazing.

559
00:33:46,978 --> 00:33:48,169
Guys eat dust!

560
00:33:51,232 --> 00:33:53,915
Current, the bat is broken.
What would they do now?

561
00:34:00,092 --> 00:34:01,121
They're done for good!

562
00:34:01,358 --> 00:34:02,977
Hey, German!

563
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:07,071
-Hey, where's he going?
-We're doomed!

564
00:34:07,116 --> 00:34:07,798
I pity them!

565
00:34:08,063 --> 00:34:09,993
-What is he doing?
-I don't know.

566
00:34:18,185 --> 00:34:20,243
-Look at him.
-Did he get him a stump?

567
00:34:22,635 --> 00:34:23,856
What the hell is he doing?

568
00:34:29,172 --> 00:34:31,040
Come on, Ranjith!

569
00:34:35,942 --> 00:34:37,980
Ranjith, Anna, don't spare them.

570
00:34:45,758 --> 00:34:47,157
Come on! Come on, Rajesh!

571
00:34:47,643 --> 00:34:48,885
Machan, bowl hard!

572
00:35:15,689 --> 00:35:17,149
Hey, Current, don't lose the catch.

573
00:35:39,176 --> 00:35:39,957
Damn!

574
00:35:53,348 --> 00:35:55,657
Now, do you realize which team
is incredible?

575
00:35:55,682 --> 00:35:59,462
Aren't you ashamed to be proud
over a three ball match?

576
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:01,628
You could not even win a three ball match!

577
00:36:02,695 --> 00:36:04,676
I dare you to play another match!

578
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,152
If we defeat you here...

579
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,880
the people won't know
about our achievements.

580
00:36:09,316 --> 00:36:11,233
Shall we play a match
during this temple carnival?

581
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:12,239
Are you ready?

582
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:24,048
Until there's a competition,
everyone is best in their own eyes.

583
00:36:24,623 --> 00:36:26,036
Instead of locking horns in vain.

584
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,488
Let's play a match,
and we'll know who's the best.

585
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:28,659
What do you say Ravi?

586
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:30,028
Sure let's play!

587
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:32,653
Do you think the people will agree
to a match during the carnival?

588
00:36:32,945 --> 00:36:34,053
That too between these two teams!

589
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,048
Hey, I'll speak to my Mama.

590
00:36:40,374 --> 00:36:42,014
We have to play a match
during the carnival.

591
00:36:44,087 --> 00:36:45,067
I will defeat them!

592
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,854
I will defeat them in front of the people.

593
00:36:50,487 --> 00:36:52,979
This is to inform the people
of the village...

594
00:36:53,108 --> 00:36:54,521
Tomorrow in our village

595
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,368
there will be a panchayat meeting.

596
00:36:56,561 --> 00:37:01,191
All the men, women, elders, and youngsters
are requested to participate...

597
00:37:01,314 --> 00:37:05,447
and grace the meeting with your presence!

598
00:37:05,521 --> 00:37:08,859
Ranjith, we should somehow play
a match against them.

599
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,727
Hey, Emman Anna is coming.
Let me talk to him.

600
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:14,546
Hey, Ranjith!

601
00:37:14,611 --> 00:37:16,188
-Huh!
-I heard you came looking for me.

602
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:17,406
What's the matter?

603
00:37:22,524 --> 00:37:24,910
Anna, after your last match...

604
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:26,848
there was no tournament conducted
on this ground.

605
00:37:27,146 --> 00:37:29,757
You should convince the elders
to organize a match.

606
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:31,113
Please Anna!

607
00:37:33,396 --> 00:37:35,335
During this carnival,
we have to organize a match.

608
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:39,219
The old case is still unsolved.

609
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:42,926
Despite graduates,
they're not able to find a job.

610
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,128
They're affluent.

611
00:37:45,352 --> 00:37:46,580
Why do we have to poke the bear?

612
00:37:46,652 --> 00:37:48,571
During that incident
we should've ended it good.

613
00:37:49,212 --> 00:37:49,876
We missed it!

614
00:37:51,348 --> 00:37:53,365
-A cricket match is crucial!
-He is right!

615
00:37:53,544 --> 00:37:56,961
Our boys are at each other's throats
as there's no opportunity to play.

616
00:37:58,262 --> 00:38:00,350
The problem that originated during
a match should end with a game.

617
00:38:01,854 --> 00:38:04,162
Sports bring discipline.

618
00:38:04,426 --> 00:38:05,150
Understood?

619
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,049
This carnival there should be
a cricket match.

620
00:38:08,303 --> 00:38:09,391
Yes, there should be a match!

621
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,978
Are you not happy
that the village is at peace?

622
00:38:12,053 --> 00:38:13,102
Hey, calm down!

623
00:38:13,294 --> 00:38:15,887
It's not like only a match
will cause fights.

624
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:19,443
Like Emmanuel mentioned
sports brings discipline.

625
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:20,842
Also the boys will keep order.

626
00:38:20,943 --> 00:38:22,852
Many have landed a job
because of sports.

627
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:25,267
Listen sports is important.

628
00:38:26,066 --> 00:38:27,323
Fine, do as you wish.

629
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,800
Hey, that's awesome!

630
00:38:28,855 --> 00:38:31,177
As far as there's unity
it's good for the village.

631
00:38:31,232 --> 00:38:33,256
I hope you don't lose to them.

632
00:38:33,336 --> 00:38:35,338
Sister, donate as much as you can.

633
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,818
It's for the God. Please donate.

634
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:42,085
Listen Gopal...

635
00:38:42,381 --> 00:38:43,649
you should handle everything this time.

636
00:38:43,743 --> 00:38:47,647
No matter the cost I'll bear it all
for the deity's ritual.

637
00:38:47,855 --> 00:38:50,554
-Go ahead tell him.
-This time, there's folk dance...

638
00:38:51,532 --> 00:38:52,552
a band,

639
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:55,068
-And cricket...
-What?

640
00:39:00,748 --> 00:39:02,438
My nephew did mention about it.

641
00:39:05,164 --> 00:39:06,932
-On the temple's ground?
-Yes!

642
00:39:12,855 --> 00:39:14,481
Is it imperative to organize a match?

643
00:39:15,267 --> 00:39:15,955
Yes, Mama!

644
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:17,931
We need to play against them.

645
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:21,531
Didn't you renovate the ground
for the boys to play?

646
00:39:28,498 --> 00:39:30,089
-Inspector is your man.
-So?

647
00:39:30,216 --> 00:39:32,829
Request him to provide security.

648
00:39:33,155 --> 00:39:34,418
Fine, you people carry on!

649
00:39:34,786 --> 00:39:36,664
-I'll discuss and get back.
-Sure!

650
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:40,284
Look at him glare at us.

651
00:39:40,398 --> 00:39:42,308
We'll handle him during the match.

652
00:39:54,655 --> 00:39:56,920
Hey, will you pass the exam this year?

653
00:39:57,142 --> 00:39:58,406
You don't go to coaching class.

654
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,519
But you're punctual as a Romeo.

655
00:40:06,972 --> 00:40:08,662
-Anna, one ink pen.
-Sure!

656
00:40:17,296 --> 00:40:19,461
Anna, this is the twenty bucks
I owe you from before.

657
00:40:19,749 --> 00:40:21,172
-Thank you, Anna.
-I don't want it.

658
00:40:21,524 --> 00:40:22,066
Let's go!

659
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:26,545
Hey, what are you doing?

660
00:40:26,692 --> 00:40:28,468
Anna, don't touch this currency.

661
00:40:28,696 --> 00:40:30,194
I will go home and bring another currency.

662
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:31,374
-Hey!
-I promise!

663
00:40:31,935 --> 00:40:34,016
-You can keep my watch.
-I understand.

664
00:40:34,385 --> 00:40:35,777
I see you daily. I understand.

665
00:40:35,878 --> 00:40:37,333
You can keep it.
You can pay me tomorrow.

666
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:43,246
"The moment when your fingers
touched this lifeless twenty bucks."

667
00:40:43,503 --> 00:40:46,762
"The twenty bucks would double up
with joy."

668
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:49,509
"But I am alive, and when will you
grace me with your touch."

669
00:41:02,816 --> 00:41:04,506
We've seen them play with other teams.

670
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:06,203
We should not underestimate them.

671
00:41:06,732 --> 00:41:07,811
All of the them are good players.

672
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:09,160
They call themselves a cricket team.

673
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:11,950
Ranjith!

674
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:15,447
Sam!

675
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:17,552
And Bharath!

676
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:19,375
If we get their wickets,
we're good.

677
00:41:21,473 --> 00:41:22,270
Rajesh!

678
00:41:24,512 --> 00:41:25,421
Venkatesh!

679
00:41:25,988 --> 00:41:28,295
And then Current Kunji!

680
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,278
A match after years of gap.

681
00:41:32,667 --> 00:41:35,052
Let's not worry and play with grit!

682
00:41:35,371 --> 00:41:37,296
Weren't you waiting for this day?

683
00:41:38,801 --> 00:41:39,603
Stop showing your teeth!

684
00:41:39,816 --> 00:41:41,883
I'm talking about something else.

685
00:41:42,546 --> 00:41:43,370
Ranjith...

686
00:41:44,006 --> 00:41:46,665
You and your team have a weakness.

687
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,235
What is it?

688
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:50,872
Your fielding is off.

689
00:41:51,496 --> 00:41:52,220
Fielding is off?

690
00:41:53,123 --> 00:41:53,840
Care to explain?

691
00:41:54,255 --> 00:41:56,470
When a fielder throws the ball
to the stumps

692
00:41:56,574 --> 00:41:58,107
another fielder does not cover him.

693
00:41:58,815 --> 00:42:01,144
-Throw here.
-You're giving away an overthrow.

694
00:42:01,258 --> 00:42:03,118
And to catch the ball only one is running.

695
00:42:03,244 --> 00:42:06,149
Only if two run to the ball
one can get it and throw.

696
00:42:08,536 --> 00:42:11,695
But during a wicket
everyone run to the ball.

697
00:42:11,734 --> 00:42:12,738
And lose the catch.

698
00:42:14,713 --> 00:42:16,553
During that time if one says "leave it."

699
00:42:16,626 --> 00:42:17,813
The others should move away.

700
00:42:27,653 --> 00:42:29,125
I may not be right.

701
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:31,012
Cricket is not going to put
food on the table.

702
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:32,324
It will!

703
00:42:33,198 --> 00:42:34,355
If you play well, it will.

704
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:36,268
He will get a job at ICF.

705
00:42:37,042 --> 00:42:38,050
I will make the application.

706
00:42:38,594 --> 00:42:40,320
Wait and watch the appointment letter
will come home.

707
00:42:40,479 --> 00:42:42,894
When the coal dispenser's son

708
00:42:42,987 --> 00:42:44,776
gets appointed as a Railway officer,
it brings pride.

709
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:47,071
Yeah right. That too in this village.

710
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,135
Pride is in abundance.

711
00:42:48,229 --> 00:42:51,056
You speak about pride in vain.

712
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:53,312
You pride will be pissed on.

713
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:01,339
It'll be embarrassing to lose to them.

714
00:43:02,862 --> 00:43:05,184
Where are you throwing the ball?
Throw to the stumps.

715
00:43:06,403 --> 00:43:07,760
-Hey!
-Hey, that's it!

716
00:43:09,936 --> 00:43:10,938
Hey, look at him.

717
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:13,386
Bowl!

718
00:43:15,488 --> 00:43:17,488
That's a doughnut, my friend.

719
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,864
It's a delicious treat to eat.

720
00:43:19,411 --> 00:43:20,717
What the hell are you doing?

721
00:43:20,988 --> 00:43:22,124
Can't you follow the ball?

722
00:43:22,194 --> 00:43:23,878
If you're not interested
don't come to play.

723
00:43:31,149 --> 00:43:32,571
Look at them losing it.

724
00:43:32,638 --> 00:43:35,142
Hey, Mathi, don't run your mouth;
focus on practice.

725
00:43:35,603 --> 00:43:37,677
Hey, they're looking.
Don't go!

726
00:43:39,381 --> 00:43:40,894
Hey, come on bowl!

727
00:43:45,424 --> 00:43:47,639
Hey, Ravi, you've been bowling wide.
Are you not interested?

728
00:43:50,543 --> 00:43:53,270
Now do you realize
who's the best team?

729
00:44:05,049 --> 00:44:06,391
We have to chase them away!

730
00:44:07,247 --> 00:44:08,440
Our victory is confirmed.

731
00:44:08,707 --> 00:44:09,417
How can you tell?

732
00:44:11,847 --> 00:44:12,770
Come to the playground you'll know.

733
00:44:13,558 --> 00:44:15,241
After this they won't be able to face us.

734
00:44:22,224 --> 00:44:22,813
Hey!

735
00:44:23,388 --> 00:44:24,044
Hey, watch out!

736
00:44:24,332 --> 00:44:26,719
Parents send them to study
and they're romancing.

737
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,091
Could you give me your picture?

738
00:44:34,821 --> 00:44:35,629
For what?

739
00:44:37,046 --> 00:44:39,014
My nephew is refusing to eat food.

740
00:44:39,131 --> 00:44:41,197
I'm going to use your picture
to scare him. So that he'll eat.

741
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:42,873
You're incorrigible!

742
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:45,639
I hate the weekends.

743
00:44:52,533 --> 00:44:55,195
Hey, don't you love me?

744
00:44:55,593 --> 00:44:57,943
I asked for you picture.
Can't you ask for mine?

745
00:45:07,003 --> 00:45:07,841
Impressed!

746
00:45:11,305 --> 00:45:13,708
-Hey!
-Let go of my hand.

747
00:45:14,122 --> 00:45:15,770
-Come on...
-I have to go home.

748
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:17,322
I'll get my friend's bike
and drop you home.

749
00:45:17,408 --> 00:45:18,423
Drop me home?

750
00:45:18,492 --> 00:45:20,091
Why don't you stay at my place
for a couple of days?

751
00:45:20,139 --> 00:45:21,907
Let go of my hand.
I have to go home.

752
00:45:27,082 --> 00:45:27,679
Hey!

753
00:45:29,683 --> 00:45:30,371
What happened?

754
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,769
Hey, I'm speaking to you!

755
00:45:33,176 --> 00:45:33,871
Ranjith!

756
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,557
Hey!

757
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:18,513
Ranjith, freshen up and get ready.

758
00:46:19,137 --> 00:46:20,862
I have to pray today.

759
00:46:25,444 --> 00:46:27,347
I'm speaking to you
and you're ignoring.

760
00:46:27,454 --> 00:46:28,732
Get up! I said, get up!

761
00:46:29,109 --> 00:46:30,067
-I said, get up!
-Ma! Ma!

762
00:46:30,643 --> 00:46:32,028
Hey, what is it?

763
00:46:32,455 --> 00:46:34,227
How dare you raise your voice?

764
00:46:34,446 --> 00:46:36,250
For sure the God will intervene.

765
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,055
Watch out for the judgement day.

766
00:46:39,176 --> 00:46:40,114
What's wrong with you?

767
00:46:40,466 --> 00:46:41,943
All these years you were
fighting with him.

768
00:46:42,067 --> 00:46:43,970
Now when I threw water on him
you're reacting.

769
00:46:44,605 --> 00:46:46,885
Ma, you threw water on my book.

770
00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:49,012
Show me. Hey!

771
00:46:49,246 --> 00:46:51,231
Hey, where did you get the twenty bucks?

772
00:46:52,224 --> 00:46:53,594
Did you steal it from your
Appa's pocket?

773
00:46:54,383 --> 00:46:57,018
Since morning your Appa has been
eating my ears off.

774
00:46:57,188 --> 00:46:59,546
Ma, do I look like a thief to you?

775
00:46:59,934 --> 00:47:01,447
If I ask Appa is going to give me money.

776
00:47:01,628 --> 00:47:03,233
It must be your eldest son.
Ask him.

777
00:47:03,406 --> 00:47:04,393
Always nagging me.

778
00:47:04,436 --> 00:47:06,523
What would you do with so much money?

779
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,045
-Give it to me.
-Let go. I'm leaving.

780
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,584
Eventually you will come to me.

781
00:47:09,649 --> 00:47:12,873
Sam, granny bought you many things.

782
00:47:12,937 --> 00:47:15,295
Buy me some betel nuts, son.

783
00:47:15,392 --> 00:47:15,846
Get lost, Gran!

784
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:17,908
Hey, why are you getting dressed up?

785
00:47:18,022 --> 00:47:19,762
-Nothing Ma.
-Bring me a pot of water.

786
00:47:19,793 --> 00:47:20,759
Ma, is Ranjith home?

787
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,423
I'm coming!

788
00:47:22,463 --> 00:47:24,153
Are you guys headed to the playground.

789
00:47:24,218 --> 00:47:25,127
No Ma!

790
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,027
I heard about a match on the carnival day.

791
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,166
Please don't participate in it.

792
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,559
There are evil people out there.

793
00:47:29,717 --> 00:47:31,144
I will take care of him.
Don't worry!

794
00:47:31,225 --> 00:47:33,559
Ranjith, if I see you near that place...

795
00:47:33,591 --> 00:47:34,525
Ma, don't worry.

796
00:47:34,568 --> 00:47:36,833
Don't go over there.
It'll end up in a fight.

797
00:47:36,892 --> 00:47:38,795
At least you buy me betel nuts.

798
00:47:38,908 --> 00:47:40,392
I will surely buy it
on my way back home.

799
00:47:40,595 --> 00:47:41,759
Hey! Hey!

800
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,271
If I diligently pray...

801
00:47:44,379 --> 00:47:47,348
there will be no match
and everyone will be wasted.

802
00:47:50,386 --> 00:47:52,511
In Arakkonam district, Perumbachai village

803
00:47:52,614 --> 00:47:55,113
in accord to
Maariamman temple carnival

804
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,386
cricket tournament is organized.

805
00:47:56,778 --> 00:47:58,231
What makes it important is...

806
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:00,590
due to an incident six years ago

807
00:48:00,738 --> 00:48:03,269
a decision was made not to
conduct any matches.

808
00:48:03,449 --> 00:48:04,800
I'm sure everyone is aware of it.

809
00:48:04,894 --> 00:48:06,517
As two villages are going to
come together.

810
00:48:06,587 --> 00:48:09,207
-Mano, you pad up.-Due to Annan Gopalan's effort...

811
00:48:09,232 --> 00:48:12,079
the people and the elders of this village
have decided to conduct this match.

812
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:17,730
Aasir Annan is felicitating
Annan Gopal with a garland.

813
00:48:18,181 --> 00:48:18,931
The next match...

814
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:21,126
It's between Perumbachai colony
Blue Star team

815
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:24,415
versus Perumbachai's Alpha team.

816
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,095
Who are these guys
in white uniforms?

817
00:48:28,174 --> 00:48:29,572
Boss, over here. Over here!

818
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:31,899
They look like league players.

819
00:48:32,064 --> 00:48:33,391
Hey, where did you bring us?

820
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:37,728
You can park here!

821
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:38,908
Anna, who are they?

822
00:48:41,503 --> 00:48:42,430
Who are they?

823
00:48:42,484 --> 00:48:43,477
This is new!

824
00:48:44,878 --> 00:48:46,058
Welcome, Boss. Welcome!

825
00:48:49,867 --> 00:48:52,070
I request you to play for our team.

826
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,468
Hello, we are league players.

827
00:48:54,914 --> 00:48:56,924
-Hear me out...
-Wait! Who are the opponents?

828
00:48:56,969 --> 00:48:58,156
They're colony boys from our village.

829
00:48:59,014 --> 00:49:01,053
If we play in your team
they won't stand a chance.

830
00:49:01,368 --> 00:49:02,945
That's what we want!

831
00:49:03,095 --> 00:49:04,657
They brought in league players.

832
00:49:04,751 --> 00:49:06,243
How can they bring in league players?

833
00:49:06,369 --> 00:49:08,938
It's specified in the form that we can
bring in players from outside.

834
00:49:09,165 --> 00:49:11,066
Hey, we'll handle them!

835
00:49:11,977 --> 00:49:13,633
We don't have a kit.
But nothing to worry.

836
00:49:14,859 --> 00:49:15,780
We can face anyone we want.

837
00:49:15,967 --> 00:49:17,420
We'll play the game!

838
00:49:17,984 --> 00:49:19,173
Take this as advance.

839
00:49:19,655 --> 00:49:21,053
After the match I'll pay you balance.

840
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:24,905
Where do we sit?

841
00:49:24,996 --> 00:49:27,243
-We're running out of time.
-Over here.

842
00:49:27,307 --> 00:49:29,096
Team captains come to the field
and toss the coin.

843
00:49:29,235 --> 00:49:31,128
Hey, Ravi, Vasanth, hurry up!

844
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:32,829
-Get going.-The other teams are waiting.

845
00:49:32,897 --> 00:49:35,070
-Come on. Hurry up.
-There's no space over here.

846
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,329
The match is about to begin.

847
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:40,415
If you speak to the boys.
They'll be inspired.

848
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:42,226
-Hello!
-You mean these guys?

849
00:49:43,068 --> 00:49:44,674
No need. We can handle it.

850
00:49:44,788 --> 00:49:46,788
-I think he did not ask before.
-If we win the toss pick batting.

851
00:49:46,946 --> 00:49:48,274
Ask both the captains
to come to the field.

852
00:49:49,617 --> 00:49:51,089
-Head or tail?
-Head!

853
00:49:52,843 --> 00:49:54,329
The coin is being tossed.

854
00:49:54,446 --> 00:49:55,299
Play well.

855
00:49:55,465 --> 00:49:57,293
Hey, give them a new ball.

856
00:50:00,134 --> 00:50:01,172
Anna, did you lose the toss?

857
00:50:01,219 --> 00:50:02,320
Can't you make it on time?

858
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:04,960
Opening batsmen:
Nandagopalan-Sunil

859
00:50:05,025 --> 00:50:07,797
Bharath is bowling now.

860
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:12,422
-That's fantastic bowling!
-Super Bharath!

861
00:50:12,477 --> 00:50:14,773
Bharath is a star bowler.

862
00:50:14,866 --> 00:50:16,404
-Next ball...
-Great bowling.

863
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,211
This is a fantastic ball, too.

864
00:50:18,297 --> 00:50:19,429
Super Bharath!

865
00:50:19,486 --> 00:50:20,720
I thought he'd strike,
but he missed it.

866
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,643
The game is getting interesting.

867
00:50:22,743 --> 00:50:24,792
It's been a while
since a match this interesting.

868
00:50:25,174 --> 00:50:27,297
-The batsman is checking the soil.
-Why is he checking the soil?

869
00:50:27,367 --> 00:50:29,321
Come on, come on, Bharath!

870
00:50:29,431 --> 00:50:30,954
Maintain offside!

871
00:50:32,682 --> 00:50:34,518
That's a fantastic shot!

872
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:37,472
The ball flew over the boundary.

873
00:50:37,518 --> 00:50:39,299
-It's a Six!
-Awesome!

874
00:50:39,401 --> 00:50:40,041
Super Boss!

875
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,909
Nandagopalan scored the first six
of the match.

876
00:50:43,453 --> 00:50:46,312
Let's wait and watch
Nandagopalan's game.

877
00:50:46,999 --> 00:50:48,119
Come on, keep bowling.

878
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:51,119
Machan, we're going to win!

879
00:50:51,167 --> 00:50:52,222
Come on, Bharath!

880
00:50:57,375 --> 00:50:58,328
Good shot!

881
00:51:04,776 --> 00:51:05,711
Catch the ball.

882
00:51:07,165 --> 00:51:08,729
Four!

883
00:51:09,852 --> 00:51:10,398
Strike!

884
00:51:15,181 --> 00:51:15,972
Hit it!

885
00:51:26,978 --> 00:51:28,964
Sam, think before you bowl.

886
00:51:29,032 --> 00:51:29,907
It's so funny.

887
00:51:30,496 --> 00:51:32,938
Playing with these kids is like
net practice for us.

888
00:51:33,054 --> 00:51:34,245
-It's boring.
-You play your game.

889
00:51:34,438 --> 00:51:35,240
Watch me now!

890
00:51:37,537 --> 00:51:39,660
Come on! Come on!
Keep it up!

891
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:43,730
Come on, keep up the pace!
Bowl!

892
00:51:47,988 --> 00:51:50,097
That's it! You nailed it Sam.

893
00:51:50,122 --> 00:51:51,472
-Hey!
-Oh, no!

894
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:53,523
As expected, for his team...

895
00:51:53,608 --> 00:51:54,549
-What's wrong with you?-...he made a wicket.

896
00:51:54,651 --> 00:51:56,437
Sam is rocking with his performance.

897
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,937
The next batsman is, Venkat.

898
00:52:01,001 --> 00:52:01,680
What is it?

899
00:52:04,762 --> 00:52:05,589
Over here.

900
00:52:07,508 --> 00:52:09,453
Howzzzat! Yes!

901
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:11,496
-That's great, Bharath!
-Hey!

902
00:52:11,624 --> 00:52:13,577
The score is at 58 for 2 wickets.

903
00:52:13,602 --> 00:52:14,922
Come on, Rajesh!

904
00:52:14,984 --> 00:52:18,245
The next batsman is the captain
of Alpha team, Rajesh.

905
00:52:18,414 --> 00:52:20,719
He's a fantastic right-hand batsman.

906
00:52:21,148 --> 00:52:22,187
Sam is bowling.

907
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,586
There goes an amazing boundary.

908
00:52:24,735 --> 00:52:26,375
Rajesh, keep it up.
Keep scoring!

909
00:52:26,445 --> 00:52:27,282
Throw it here!

910
00:52:27,843 --> 00:52:29,016
Continuous boundaries!

911
00:52:29,106 --> 00:52:30,308
Super!

912
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:35,992
He scored on all sides of the field.

913
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:36,886
Fantastic shot!

914
00:52:38,529 --> 00:52:40,529
-Stay there.
-Boss, we can score.

915
00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:42,037
That's it!

916
00:52:42,172 --> 00:52:44,177
-Another single...
-Boss, 1 run?

917
00:52:45,437 --> 00:52:47,444
-There he goes again.
-Make the catch.

918
00:52:47,663 --> 00:52:49,179
That's a sixer!

919
00:52:51,036 --> 00:52:52,061
Nothing to worry.

920
00:52:52,343 --> 00:52:54,702
Sam, let them score.
Don't worry.

921
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:56,002
It was a fluke!

922
00:52:56,077 --> 00:53:02,996
In this tournament,
Alpha team is playing a great match.

923
00:53:03,487 --> 00:53:06,101
Sam is getting ready to bowl.

924
00:53:06,772 --> 00:53:08,022
Here comes the next ball.

925
00:53:08,328 --> 00:53:10,202
-It's going to the off side.
-Catch Ranjith!

926
00:53:14,128 --> 00:53:15,223
Great catch, Ranjith!

927
00:53:21,701 --> 00:53:26,042
In 10 overs, the Alpha team
is at 96 runs for 3 wickets.

928
00:53:26,139 --> 00:53:28,506
Nandagopalan is scoring...

929
00:53:28,601 --> 00:53:31,781
left, right and centre
to make up for the loss.

930
00:53:32,556 --> 00:53:34,900
Last ball.
Nandagopalan, a great shot.

931
00:53:35,134 --> 00:53:37,063
This, too, is a sixer.

932
00:53:37,609 --> 00:53:39,609
Nandagopalan has scored
half a century.

933
00:53:39,695 --> 00:53:41,577
-Well played.
-Come on, keep it up!

934
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:46,226
Alpha team's innings end
with 3 wickets in 12 overs...

935
00:53:46,878 --> 00:53:48,500
That was a good game.

936
00:53:48,664 --> 00:53:49,547
Awesome!

937
00:53:49,596 --> 00:53:51,635
The first innings has come to an end.

938
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:55,228
No one has scored this high
on this playground to date.

939
00:53:55,422 --> 00:53:59,282
Alpha team has scored 120 runs.

940
00:53:59,504 --> 00:54:00,739
From Team Blue Star...

941
00:54:00,819 --> 00:54:01,966
Boss, what about a fielder here?

942
00:54:02,076 --> 00:54:03,861
...the batsmen
have arrived on the field.

943
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,710
Team Alpha looks excited.

944
00:54:07,014 --> 00:54:09,626
Bala is bowling the first over.

945
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:13,853
Fantastic ball. Amazing bouncer!

946
00:54:13,913 --> 00:54:16,118
-Play patiently.-That was a fantastic bouncer.

947
00:54:16,184 --> 00:54:19,096
Next ball! They're not able to
face Bala's bowling.

948
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,824
Next over...

949
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,204
Play with your bat.

950
00:54:25,253 --> 00:54:28,603
They're swinging the bat
but no contact.

951
00:54:30,096 --> 00:54:32,189
-These people are rough.
-You're right!

952
00:54:33,384 --> 00:54:35,009
Next ball from Bala to Mani.

953
00:54:35,172 --> 00:54:37,079
-Out!
-Howzzat!

954
00:54:39,297 --> 00:54:40,445
Go wide. Come on, go wide!

955
00:54:41,393 --> 00:54:44,143
-Don't you understand? Go!
-That's it. Bowl!

956
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,282
Bala is bowling.

957
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:47,852
Hey, fantastic ball!

958
00:54:48,346 --> 00:54:48,933
Super!

959
00:54:49,011 --> 00:54:51,119
-His height is a great advantage.
-It was an easy wicket.

960
00:54:51,196 --> 00:54:52,040
Machan, awesome!

961
00:54:53,003 --> 00:54:54,862
Ranjith, you go and bat.

962
00:54:54,908 --> 00:54:57,307
Blue Star's game is sloppy
at the moment.

963
00:54:57,370 --> 00:55:00,056
Here comes Blue Star's Captain, Ranjith.

964
00:55:01,042 --> 00:55:02,969
-You go to square leg.
-Shall we put him here?

965
00:55:03,028 --> 00:55:04,484
-He's good at...
-Hold on, what is it?

966
00:55:04,865 --> 00:55:06,412
Can't you see I'm setting up fielding?

967
00:55:06,968 --> 00:55:09,719
-Do you need another fielder over there?
-Come on!

968
00:55:15,132 --> 00:55:16,837
Fantastic bowling!

969
00:55:16,969 --> 00:55:18,670
-They can't face it.
-Ranjith lost his chance.

970
00:55:19,165 --> 00:55:20,748
Let's see if he's able to
play next ball.

971
00:55:21,329 --> 00:55:22,850
That was an amazing length.

972
00:55:23,431 --> 00:55:25,347
That's great.
They're not able to play.

973
00:55:25,414 --> 00:55:27,906
-Blue Star is in a dire situation.
-I could've played.

974
00:55:28,173 --> 00:55:33,750
Let's wait and watch
if Ranjith can make a difference.

975
00:55:33,905 --> 00:55:36,259
Now we have Bala returning to bowl.

976
00:55:37,428 --> 00:55:38,532
Ranjith is going to bat.

977
00:55:39,304 --> 00:55:41,275
The ball is charging towards
the boundary.

978
00:55:41,642 --> 00:55:42,845
Sixer! Sixer!

979
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:44,931
That's a fantastic sixer by Ranjith.

980
00:55:45,204 --> 00:55:48,688
With the first sixer,
Ranjith is boosting the team's score.

981
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,978
The next boundary is on the offside.

982
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:53,791
-Hey!
-What's wrong with him?

983
00:55:53,853 --> 00:55:55,564
Ranjith is scoring on all sides
of the field.

984
00:55:55,744 --> 00:55:57,816
-Keep running!
-Ranjith, slay the pitch!

985
00:55:58,023 --> 00:55:59,366
Let's try one over.

986
00:55:59,428 --> 00:56:00,625
I know this batsman well.

987
00:56:01,271 --> 00:56:01,936
Thank you.

988
00:56:01,985 --> 00:56:03,909
They're discussing
who'd be bowling next.

989
00:56:04,295 --> 00:56:06,736
The next over is by Captain Rajesh.

990
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,484
Out! Get out of here!

991
00:56:10,943 --> 00:56:13,133
Captain Rajesh, that was fantastic bowling.

992
00:56:13,353 --> 00:56:16,009
Rajesh has proved he's a captain.

993
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:16,965
Move to the front.

994
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:18,517
Next batsman is Ammukutty.

995
00:56:18,601 --> 00:56:19,149
Move to your right.

996
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,837
He's an aggressive player.

997
00:56:21,906 --> 00:56:23,212
Current catch the ball!

998
00:56:27,275 --> 00:56:29,275
Ammukutty got out as quickly
as he got on the field.

999
00:56:29,314 --> 00:56:30,600
Hey, Current don't overdo it.

1000
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:32,415
Hey, have patience.

1001
00:56:32,673 --> 00:56:34,584
For now play singles.
Later we can score higher.

1002
00:56:35,491 --> 00:56:36,806
-Please listen to me.-Next batsman is Sam.

1003
00:56:37,008 --> 00:56:37,949
Who's going to bowl the next over?

1004
00:56:38,034 --> 00:56:38,610
Give me the ball.

1005
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:39,871
I wonder who's going to bowl?
Ravi?.

1006
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,837
Bala, he will bowl.
Learn from him.

1007
00:56:42,836 --> 00:56:43,633
Come on!

1008
00:56:43,682 --> 00:56:46,017
Are you a fool? It's just the first ball,
and you're swinging.

1009
00:56:48,547 --> 00:56:49,984
Hey, stop swinging!

1010
00:56:50,267 --> 00:56:51,016
Play patiently.

1011
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:53,496
-The next is a single run.
-Come on, make a run.

1012
00:56:54,004 --> 00:56:54,689
Run!

1013
00:56:55,973 --> 00:56:57,400
Sam and Ranjith are playing
a good partnership.

1014
00:56:57,454 --> 00:56:58,220
Oh, damn!

1015
00:56:58,291 --> 00:57:00,228
There goes another boundary.
Ranjith is rocking.

1016
00:57:04,595 --> 00:57:06,978
He's bowling to the leg-side.
The next ball is going to be a sixer.

1017
00:57:14,002 --> 00:57:15,162
Keep bowling to that side.

1018
00:57:24,837 --> 00:57:26,378
Ranjith is ready to face the ball.

1019
00:57:26,758 --> 00:57:29,182
-Ranjith is injured by the ball.
-Damn!

1020
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:31,391
-Hey! Hey!
-Well bowled!

1021
00:57:31,484 --> 00:57:33,281
Hey, Ranjith, what happened?

1022
00:57:33,547 --> 00:57:34,844
-Can you play?
-Are you okay?

1023
00:57:34,892 --> 00:57:36,000
Can you play?

1024
00:57:36,095 --> 00:57:38,213
He needs first aid.

1025
00:57:39,271 --> 00:57:40,501
He's done. He's badly hurt.

1026
00:57:40,556 --> 00:57:41,296
Take him away.

1027
00:57:41,344 --> 00:57:43,001
Where are you going?
You're next!

1028
00:57:43,056 --> 00:57:45,189
Ranjith is retired hurt.

1029
00:57:45,323 --> 00:57:46,196
Fantastic bowling.

1030
00:57:46,517 --> 00:57:48,063
Well bowled Bala. Keep it up!

1031
00:57:49,137 --> 00:57:50,197
Did you see his delivery?

1032
00:58:21,232 --> 00:58:22,881
It's a fantastic win for Alpha Team.

1033
00:58:23,689 --> 00:58:26,920
Unable to face Bala and Sriram's bowling...

1034
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:31,281
The Blue Star team lost by 35 runs.

1035
00:58:31,415 --> 00:58:35,322
On behalf of the organizing committee
and the people of the village...

1036
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:37,222
Hey, Sam, did you see that?

1037
00:58:37,517 --> 00:58:40,382
-I don't know how to face people.
-It's humiliating.

1038
00:58:43,531 --> 00:58:45,562
To lose like this, they were showing off.

1039
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:50,517
You were showing off
but nothing to prove.

1040
00:58:54,689 --> 00:59:00,282
Alpha team won by 35 runs
against Blue Star team.

1041
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:03,571
Thanks a lot, Boss.
If not for you...

1042
00:59:03,619 --> 00:59:04,845
Will we get our payment tomorrow?

1043
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:06,132
For sure!

1044
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:07,399
Let's go!

1045
00:59:07,767 --> 00:59:09,516
Come on, machi. Let's go.

1046
00:59:09,611 --> 00:59:12,939
We request the teams to be ready.

1047
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:14,702
I will bring it in the morning.

1048
00:59:14,961 --> 00:59:15,959
I hope it will be in tomorrow.

1049
00:59:17,264 --> 00:59:18,662
Boss... Boss, thanks!

1050
00:59:19,163 --> 00:59:20,318
Get ready for the toss!

1051
00:59:20,794 --> 00:59:24,217
Shortly the next match will begin.

1052
00:59:27,928 --> 00:59:30,087
I was afraid you guys might lose.

1053
00:59:30,931 --> 00:59:32,724
-We wouldn't, Mama.
-You guys rocked!

1054
00:59:32,907 --> 00:59:34,036
-Thank you.
-Awesome!

1055
00:59:34,651 --> 00:59:35,829
-I'll take a leave.
-Okay.

1056
00:59:36,115 --> 00:59:37,193
-I'm leaving.
-Sure, Anna!

1057
00:59:38,228 --> 00:59:39,868
Anna, you worked hard
to clean up this ground.

1058
00:59:39,953 --> 00:59:41,773
But you let the boys play cricket.

1059
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:42,796
I don't get it.

1060
00:59:42,821 --> 00:59:44,039
The ground is always ours!

1061
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:47,304
You did watch how our boys
chased them away.

1062
00:59:47,493 --> 00:59:48,194
You're right!

1063
00:59:58,902 --> 01:00:02,019
Ranjith, winning and losing
is part of the match.

1064
01:00:02,121 --> 01:00:02,667
Hey!

1065
01:00:03,628 --> 01:00:04,229
Oh, God!

1066
01:00:14,604 --> 01:00:16,825
Hey, we should not have
lost to them.

1067
01:00:21,298 --> 01:00:23,189
-Anna!
-Hey, Ranjith!

1068
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:24,279
How's your hand?

1069
01:00:25,533 --> 01:00:26,681
The swelling is still there.

1070
01:00:26,979 --> 01:00:27,681
It's hurting a bit.

1071
01:00:28,306 --> 01:00:28,861
You'll be fine.

1072
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:31,136
Does your mother know about the injury?

1073
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:32,448
She must've been mad!

1074
01:00:32,487 --> 01:00:34,338
-She was crying.
-Why?

1075
01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:37,448
She believes her plea to the God
punished me.

1076
01:00:41,746 --> 01:00:44,980
After that they played two more matches.

1077
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:47,643
The opponent team had four league players.

1078
01:00:48,736 --> 01:00:50,219
But nothing compared to our match.

1079
01:00:51,168 --> 01:00:52,987
Anna, we shouldn't have lost to them.

1080
01:00:53,385 --> 01:00:56,354
Ammu, refrain from pondering
to whom you lost.

1081
01:00:56,793 --> 01:00:58,045
But figure out why you lost.

1082
01:00:58,377 --> 01:01:00,518
Important thing is to rectify the mistakes.

1083
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:01,690
Okay?

1084
01:01:02,807 --> 01:01:05,095
Can you come to the tea shop
near MCF at 09:00 a.m.?

1085
01:01:06,558 --> 01:01:08,463
We'll head to Puttur and get you plastered.

1086
01:01:09,753 --> 01:01:10,292
Okay.

1087
01:01:10,557 --> 01:01:12,104
-See you in the morning.
-Sure, Anna.

1088
01:01:18,245 --> 01:01:19,962
You're here to fulfill my needs.

1089
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:22,330
There are 100 others out there
who are ready to replace you.

1090
01:01:22,377 --> 01:01:22,978
Understood!

1091
01:01:24,878 --> 01:01:25,573
Understood?

1092
01:01:26,151 --> 01:01:28,542
If you don't get it.
Then understand and continue to work.

1093
01:01:28,949 --> 01:01:32,136
-Idiots!
-Shankar, I'll be back after a tea.

1094
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:34,444
Careful!

1095
01:01:42,103 --> 01:01:43,032
Hey, stop!

1096
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:47,441
-Hey, Velu, please raise the volume.
-Okay, Anna!

1097
01:01:48,863 --> 01:01:49,991
-Hey, Ranjith!
-Anna!

1098
01:01:50,062 --> 01:01:51,186
-Hey, Mano!
-Come, come.

1099
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:52,120
Hey, what is this?

1100
01:01:52,246 --> 01:01:52,714
Anna!

1101
01:01:52,831 --> 01:01:54,338
Looks like the swelling didn't go down.

1102
01:01:54,924 --> 01:01:56,411
It's better! Better than yesterday.

1103
01:01:56,436 --> 01:01:58,631
It's best we get it checked.

1104
01:01:59,401 --> 01:02:01,478
-Velu, three teas.
-Sure!

1105
01:02:01,689 --> 01:02:03,251
Did you take permission from work?

1106
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:14,229
-Good shot! Good shot!
-Why is he coming over here?

1107
01:02:14,594 --> 01:02:15,476
Who is he?

1108
01:02:15,917 --> 01:02:17,283
Remember the local match
from last week.

1109
01:02:17,392 --> 01:02:18,696
-Hi!
-He's the captain of that team.

1110
01:02:21,388 --> 01:02:23,050
-Boss...
-Welcome!

1111
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:25,745
-As promised, we won.
-Right!

1112
01:02:25,893 --> 01:02:27,502
I was afraid Ranjith will win it.

1113
01:02:27,564 --> 01:02:29,087
But you got his wicket.

1114
01:02:29,408 --> 01:02:31,933
But Ranjith was able to play your bowling.

1115
01:02:34,604 --> 01:02:36,213
Oh, no, I forgot about it.

1116
01:02:37,831 --> 01:02:39,206
Sorry for the delay.

1117
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,588
-Here you go.
-Take it.

1118
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:45,871
-Is it all there?
-Yes it is.

1119
01:02:51,924 --> 01:02:54,486
-He won't leave I think.
-Let him be.

1120
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,410
Let him watch us play.
You bowl.

1121
01:02:58,642 --> 01:02:59,361
Well bowled.

1122
01:03:02,532 --> 01:03:04,454
Listen, bring your foot to the front,
and play.

1123
01:03:04,844 --> 01:03:05,672
Play with front foot.

1124
01:03:05,697 --> 01:03:06,737
He's bowling above.

1125
01:03:06,893 --> 01:03:07,853
You're doing it wrong.

1126
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:09,602
You'd know if you play.

1127
01:03:10,212 --> 01:03:11,360
Sure I will.

1128
01:03:15,066 --> 01:03:16,183
What are you doing Bala?

1129
01:03:16,422 --> 01:03:17,898
He's talking too much.

1130
01:03:17,932 --> 01:03:18,933
Let him play. He'll know.

1131
01:03:19,471 --> 01:03:21,838
Why aren't you playing front foot?

1132
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:22,956
You step forward and play.

1133
01:03:23,097 --> 01:03:24,782
Go ahead and play.
You'll know.

1134
01:03:25,212 --> 01:03:26,603
He should not touch a bat again.

1135
01:03:26,753 --> 01:03:27,878
We must show him who we are.

1136
01:03:29,878 --> 01:03:30,987
I'm ready!

1137
01:03:31,245 --> 01:03:33,232
Hey, Bala, knock him out.

1138
01:03:37,415 --> 01:03:39,487
Don't spare him.
Teach him a lesson.

1139
01:03:44,837 --> 01:03:46,587
-Come on!
-Now you're talking!

1140
01:03:47,877 --> 01:03:49,736
Come on!
That's an amazing length.

1141
01:03:49,808 --> 01:03:50,566
That's the length!

1142
01:03:58,372 --> 01:03:59,573
Hey, be gentle, dude!

1143
01:04:13,618 --> 01:04:15,402
How dare he asked me to
step in the front to play?

1144
01:04:17,807 --> 01:04:19,846
Hereafter, he won't bother us.

1145
01:04:23,536 --> 01:04:24,504
What's happening here?

1146
01:04:27,105 --> 01:04:27,991
Who the hell is he?

1147
01:04:28,744 --> 01:04:29,338
Don't you have any sense?

1148
01:04:29,673 --> 01:04:30,829
Who gave you permission
to let him in here?

1149
01:04:30,936 --> 01:04:31,730
Sorry sir!

1150
01:04:31,808 --> 01:04:33,308
This is not a place
where anyone can play.

1151
01:04:33,567 --> 01:04:35,137
-You idiots!
-Sir!

1152
01:04:35,495 --> 01:04:36,440
I'm not anyone.

1153
01:04:36,713 --> 01:04:37,954
I'm Nandagopalan's friend.

1154
01:04:38,275 --> 01:04:39,428
Sir, he's not my friend.

1155
01:04:39,697 --> 01:04:41,041
I don't know who he is.

1156
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:44,182
Hey, first...

1157
01:04:44,441 --> 01:04:45,745
First, ask him to get out.

1158
01:04:48,299 --> 01:04:49,994
Hey, get out!

1159
01:04:50,957 --> 01:04:51,575
Get out!

1160
01:04:52,076 --> 01:04:54,275
Hey, go! Out!

1161
01:04:54,513 --> 01:04:56,466
Sir, don't you lay your hands on me.

1162
01:04:57,396 --> 01:04:58,294
I said get out!

1163
01:04:58,669 --> 01:05:00,067
-I said get out of here!
-Sir, don't push me.

1164
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,200
Go!

1165
01:05:01,615 --> 01:05:03,692
Security, call the Police
and throw him out.

1166
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:06,059
Did you call the Police?
Go! Get out of here!

1167
01:05:06,322 --> 01:05:07,580
Go! Out!

1168
01:05:07,736 --> 01:05:08,874
-Let go!
-Keep him out of here!

1169
01:05:09,264 --> 01:05:10,444
Get out! Get out from here.

1170
01:05:10,646 --> 01:05:11,833
Let go. I'm going.

1171
01:05:11,928 --> 01:05:14,318
I'm telling you.
Let go. I'm going.

1172
01:05:14,374 --> 01:05:15,397
What did I do wrong?

1173
01:05:15,561 --> 01:05:17,006
You stepping in here itself is wrong.

1174
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:18,373
-Get out!
-Anna, let go!

1175
01:05:18,459 --> 01:05:19,740
Hey, hold this for me.

1176
01:05:19,936 --> 01:05:21,107
-What happened?
-I don't know.

1177
01:05:21,342 --> 01:05:23,474
-Let's go and check.
-Throw him out.

1178
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:25,310
-Let go. I'm just talking.
-Get out!

1179
01:05:25,428 --> 01:05:27,428
How's it wrong to play two balls?

1180
01:05:27,694 --> 01:05:29,170
It's wrong that you stepped in here.

1181
01:05:29,249 --> 01:05:30,193
I am asking why.

1182
01:05:30,303 --> 01:05:32,099
Sir, why are you being
hard on him for no reason.

1183
01:05:32,162 --> 01:05:33,459
You're not doing your job
that's why they're stepping in.

1184
01:05:33,507 --> 01:05:34,928
-Get lost!
-Anna!

1185
01:05:36,903 --> 01:05:39,350
-Hey!
-Bloody rascal!

1186
01:05:39,553 --> 01:05:41,061
How dare you lay hands on me?

1187
01:05:41,351 --> 01:05:43,530
-Why did you beat him?
-Don't mess with me.

1188
01:05:43,717 --> 01:05:44,678
I'll thrash you!

1189
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:47,514
This is what happens
when you let the strays inside.

1190
01:05:47,701 --> 01:05:49,051
Throw them out.

1191
01:05:49,732 --> 01:05:50,770
Bloody rascals!

1192
01:05:51,138 --> 01:05:53,450
You people should remain where you belong.

1193
01:05:58,775 --> 01:05:59,395
What the hell?

1194
01:06:00,147 --> 01:06:02,397
-You're creating a scene out here...
-I'll kill you!

1195
01:06:02,569 --> 01:06:04,005
How dare you raise your hand on me?

1196
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:05,467
Hey, close the gate!

1197
01:06:05,609 --> 01:06:06,749
Bloody rascals!

1198
01:06:06,812 --> 01:06:09,407
-Sir, first give us a chance to explain.
-Sir, beat them to pulp.

1199
01:06:09,609 --> 01:06:10,766
Shut the bloody gate.

1200
01:06:11,266 --> 01:06:13,030
Creating problems at the playground.

1201
01:06:13,123 --> 01:06:14,748
How dare you lay hands on me?

1202
01:06:14,927 --> 01:06:16,696
Do you think the Government
will sit ducks?

1203
01:06:17,063 --> 01:06:18,465
Sir, arrest them!

1204
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:20,967
It's not that easy to play at this ground.

1205
01:06:21,802 --> 01:06:23,301
To play at this ground...

1206
01:06:23,467 --> 01:06:25,655
you people should be qualified.

1207
01:06:26,153 --> 01:06:26,972
Qualified!

1208
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:28,118
Hey!

1209
01:06:28,788 --> 01:06:30,709
If you dare to return to this ground.

1210
01:06:30,772 --> 01:06:32,157
This will be the result of it.

1211
01:06:32,537 --> 01:06:34,352
-Get out of here!
-Come to the station and speak.

1212
01:06:34,481 --> 01:06:36,450
-Step away.
-Sir, please let them go.

1213
01:06:36,546 --> 01:06:38,749
Sir, please let them go!

1214
01:06:38,779 --> 01:06:39,872
Sir, please let them go. Sir!

1215
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,765
You people are not allowed to
step inside that ground.

1216
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:07,132
Eh! Not did you step inside the ground...

1217
01:07:07,446 --> 01:07:08,579
but got into a fight.

1218
01:07:08,693 --> 01:07:10,598
Sir, they are students!

1219
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:12,241
You're planning to file a case.

1220
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:13,937
Students should remain students.

1221
01:07:14,013 --> 01:07:15,466
But they laid their hands on him.

1222
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:17,117
For what they did I would've
remanded them for 15 days.

1223
01:07:17,271 --> 01:07:19,271
Sir, I'll fulfill the formalities
you ask of.

1224
01:07:22,967 --> 01:07:24,084
Hey, come along!

1225
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,311
Not you both. Just you!

1226
01:07:30,765 --> 01:07:31,515
Come on, get up!

1227
01:07:33,912 --> 01:07:34,443
Come on!

1228
01:07:41,043 --> 01:07:42,632
Gopal, where's Ranjith?

1229
01:07:43,234 --> 01:07:47,257
Listen, I convinced the Police
not to file a case.

1230
01:07:48,029 --> 01:07:50,271
Pay him 1000 rupees
and they'll let him walk.

1231
01:07:50,616 --> 01:07:51,147
Let's go!

1232
01:07:51,921 --> 01:07:53,890
-1000 rupees?
-Why would I pay for him?

1233
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:09,693
In my family, no one has step foot
inside the Police station.

1234
01:08:10,882 --> 01:08:13,444
But my son indulged in a fight...

1235
01:08:13,538 --> 01:08:16,319
and never in my wildest dreams thought
he will pay a visit to the Police station.

1236
01:08:16,585 --> 01:08:19,905
Ma, I did not beat anyone
neither did I indulge in a fight.

1237
01:08:20,343 --> 01:08:21,249
I went to sign the register.

1238
01:08:21,459 --> 01:08:24,498
As if you're the President
who went to sign it.

1239
01:08:24,968 --> 01:08:28,710
Listen, "Whoever conceals his
transgressions will not prosper."

1240
01:08:28,906 --> 01:08:32,343
"But he who confesses and forsakes them
will obtain mercy."

1241
01:08:32,648 --> 01:08:33,741
I did not quote this.

1242
01:08:34,178 --> 01:08:36,949
But psalm 28:13 quotes it.

1243
01:08:36,974 --> 01:08:37,687
Here you go!

1244
01:08:37,976 --> 01:08:39,218
You can fool me.

1245
01:08:39,514 --> 01:08:41,803
But God is watching you.
Be careful.

1246
01:08:42,209 --> 01:08:44,670
Some husband I have.

1247
01:08:44,858 --> 01:08:48,132
As a father, you should be
responsible to fetch him a job.

1248
01:08:48,366 --> 01:08:50,522
But this family has a mind of its own.

1249
01:08:50,638 --> 01:08:52,474
I don't really get you.

1250
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:55,029
Our son has received a call letter
from the selection committee.

1251
01:08:55,077 --> 01:08:56,694
It's a huge thing.

1252
01:08:57,077 --> 01:08:59,615
Are you aware or not
about the sports quota?

1253
01:08:59,953 --> 01:09:02,960
ICF will be grab him
for his spectacular performance.

1254
01:09:03,084 --> 01:09:05,537
Yeah right.
As if they were waiting for him.

1255
01:09:05,732 --> 01:09:07,732
Appa, the shoes are tight.

1256
01:09:08,326 --> 01:09:09,263
They're tight is it?

1257
01:09:10,052 --> 01:09:12,341
Once I get my salary I'll buy you
new ones. Adjust for now.

1258
01:09:13,147 --> 01:09:13,756
Okay, Appa.

1259
01:09:15,226 --> 01:09:16,054
Hey, Ranjith!

1260
01:09:18,169 --> 01:09:19,528
Please read the prayer.

1261
01:09:27,216 --> 01:09:28,263
-Appa!
-What is it?

1262
01:09:28,452 --> 01:09:29,405
I don't want new shoes.

1263
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,051
I don't want anything.

1264
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:34,062
Why bother when they don't respect us?

1265
01:09:34,375 --> 01:09:35,374
Why won't they respect us?

1266
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:37,506
If you're talented,
they'll respect you.

1267
01:09:38,178 --> 01:09:40,631
Listen, go and give your best.

1268
01:09:40,865 --> 01:09:41,920
I'm sure you'll get selected.

1269
01:09:44,826 --> 01:09:47,427
If you land a good job you and
your future family will be happy.

1270
01:09:48,171 --> 01:09:48,866
Look at me.

1271
01:09:51,117 --> 01:09:53,272
Working with iron in railways
has damaged my hands.

1272
01:09:53,647 --> 01:09:55,100
I'm saying it because
I want you to have a good life.

1273
01:09:55,319 --> 01:09:56,951
They will pick you for your talent.

1274
01:09:57,343 --> 01:09:58,686
Go and play, my son.
Go ahead.

1275
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:00,694
-Okay, Pa.
-Go!

1276
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:03,472
Play well!

1277
01:10:14,232 --> 01:10:15,525
-Your name?
-Ranjith!

1278
01:10:15,701 --> 01:10:16,287
Ranjith!

1279
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:20,733
-Batch number?
-Seven!

1280
01:10:21,802 --> 01:10:22,387
Seven!

1281
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,079
Sit over there. They'll call you.

1282
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:30,596
Sir, two bowlers and two batsmen.

1283
01:10:30,882 --> 01:10:32,322
Ashwin, come here!

1284
01:10:32,867 --> 01:10:34,155
Come, come, come. Hurry up!

1285
01:10:35,755 --> 01:10:36,977
Go and get ready to play.

1286
01:10:37,205 --> 01:10:38,744
Let me check with him.

1287
01:10:38,961 --> 01:10:40,102
Please keep it over there.

1288
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:40,963
-Sir!
-What do you want?

1289
01:10:41,002 --> 01:10:42,549
I'm from Batch-1 when will you call me?

1290
01:10:43,121 --> 01:10:45,745
Just because you have a call letter
we can't let you play right away.

1291
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:47,128
Go and wait your turn.

1292
01:10:47,949 --> 01:10:49,323
They don't understand at once.

1293
01:10:49,425 --> 01:10:50,800
They issue call letters to every moron.

1294
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,315
And they make our lives difficult.

1295
01:10:52,464 --> 01:10:53,424
It's the committee's fault.

1296
01:10:53,503 --> 01:10:55,003
60 and 70 are batsmen right?

1297
01:10:55,143 --> 01:10:55,924
Where are you going?

1298
01:10:56,199 --> 01:10:58,049
Hey, they won't call us.

1299
01:10:58,182 --> 01:10:58,994
I'm leaving!

1300
01:11:00,946 --> 01:11:01,751
Murugesh!

1301
01:11:02,737 --> 01:11:04,346
-Did we send in next player?
-Yes!

1302
01:11:04,371 --> 01:11:05,588
Next, send in...

1303
01:11:06,675 --> 01:11:07,955
Sir, that's the third batch.

1304
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:10,034
Third batch?
I think it's the second batch.

1305
01:11:10,104 --> 01:11:11,947
Just play. It's all fixed.

1306
01:11:12,847 --> 01:11:14,222
Welcome. Vanakkam, sir.

1307
01:11:14,292 --> 01:11:15,190
Good morning, sir.

1308
01:11:15,236 --> 01:11:16,354
-Send in two players.
-Okay, Sir.

1309
01:11:16,432 --> 01:11:19,424
-How many are required?
-Two batsmen and two bowlers.

1310
01:11:19,518 --> 01:11:20,581
And one all-rounder, sir.

1311
01:11:23,376 --> 01:11:24,655
Give, sir, the details.

1312
01:11:25,127 --> 01:11:25,893
Here you go, sir.

1313
01:11:26,667 --> 01:11:28,401
-Check the list.
-Note down his name.

1314
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:29,724
Hari...

1315
01:11:33,682 --> 01:11:34,962
-Sir!
-What is it?

1316
01:11:35,485 --> 01:11:36,719
Sir, I was here before them.

1317
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:40,830
I said, I will call you.
Go and wait out there.

1318
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:44,205
Just because you have a call letter
we can't let you play right away.

1319
01:11:44,377 --> 01:11:46,134
We'll call you when it's your turn.
Go!

1320
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:50,561
Not that they'll nail it
if we let them play.

1321
01:11:50,876 --> 01:11:52,717
They issue call letters to anyone
and everyone.

1322
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:56,852
It's become a headache handling them.

1323
01:11:59,376 --> 01:12:00,982
I wonder where they come from.

1324
01:12:01,353 --> 01:12:02,782
Who's on the next list?

1325
01:12:05,089 --> 01:12:06,479
Both are bowlers, sir.

1326
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:24,891
Hey, catch the ball!

1327
01:12:26,578 --> 01:12:28,406
Hey, what is he doing?

1328
01:12:42,768 --> 01:12:44,268
-Who is this joker?
-Oh, god!

1329
01:12:46,338 --> 01:12:47,916
-He couldn't catch a ball.
-I wonder why they even try.

1330
01:12:48,799 --> 01:12:51,158
-Incorrigible...
-Look at his face.

1331
01:12:51,339 --> 01:12:52,737
As if he's going to catch the ball.

1332
01:13:08,418 --> 01:13:09,957
Hey, pick up the balls.

1333
01:13:10,494 --> 01:13:11,626
Isn't that why you came here?

1334
01:13:12,177 --> 01:13:13,150
Hey!

1335
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:21,998
This is not a place
where anybody can play.

1336
01:13:22,295 --> 01:13:24,599
Only the qualified should play
on this ground.

1337
01:13:28,707 --> 01:13:29,910
Son, I'll pay next month.

1338
01:13:31,896 --> 01:13:32,974
Okay, Anna!

1339
01:13:34,053 --> 01:13:35,201
Please have some more.

1340
01:13:36,105 --> 01:13:36,907
Enough?

1341
01:13:39,756 --> 01:13:40,771
Where's your ring?

1342
01:13:40,921 --> 01:13:43,155
He must've given it to someone
as engagement ring.

1343
01:13:43,257 --> 01:13:45,913
-You shut up.
-Hey, can't you shut up?

1344
01:13:46,765 --> 01:13:48,546
I'm pissed as it is.
Pipe down.

1345
01:13:48,617 --> 01:13:49,694
Get lost!

1346
01:13:50,507 --> 01:13:51,452
What happened to you?

1347
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:55,160
Hey, girl, can't you stay quiet?

1348
01:13:55,816 --> 01:13:57,225
Always picking fights with him.

1349
01:13:57,490 --> 01:13:59,365
He's not your only child.

1350
01:13:59,506 --> 01:14:00,530
Was I adopted?

1351
01:14:00,578 --> 01:14:02,092
Yeah right you were adopted.

1352
01:14:02,406 --> 01:14:03,303
Finally you found out.

1353
01:14:03,544 --> 01:14:04,974
You never help me with chores.

1354
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:17,997
After years we played
in front of the village and lost.

1355
01:14:20,313 --> 01:14:22,258
And at the Police station...

1356
01:14:23,296 --> 01:14:24,975
Emmanuel Anna begged to the Police.

1357
01:14:27,209 --> 01:14:29,179
Did I embarrass myself in the selection

1358
01:14:29,873 --> 01:14:31,087
that my father pinned his hopes on?

1359
01:14:34,547 --> 01:14:35,834
When I told him...

1360
01:14:36,443 --> 01:14:38,212
his face went pale, Anandhi!

1361
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:44,969
My team had too much faith in me.

1362
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:48,865
As a captain I lost.

1363
01:14:50,004 --> 01:14:51,019
I got defeated.

1364
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,383
Oh, God. Hey!

1365
01:14:55,138 --> 01:14:56,078
Look at me!

1366
01:14:56,679 --> 01:14:58,171
Look at tears in your eyes.

1367
01:15:01,678 --> 01:15:04,810
In ITI you failed too many times
in different subjects.

1368
01:15:06,147 --> 01:15:08,966
Never have I seen you get so emotional.

1369
01:15:09,497 --> 01:15:10,731
Come on. Don't cry.

1370
01:15:19,522 --> 01:15:21,826
If something makes us cry...

1371
01:15:22,616 --> 01:15:24,678
that means we are true to it.

1372
01:15:29,404 --> 01:15:33,374
But they made you wait at the selection
and humiliated you.

1373
01:15:34,498 --> 01:15:37,475
Even I am pissed to even hear about it.

1374
01:15:38,007 --> 01:15:39,499
It's not like they're great players.

1375
01:15:42,398 --> 01:15:43,325
I swear...

1376
01:15:43,794 --> 01:15:46,482
Those guys are nothing compared
to your prowess in the game.

1377
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:54,522
In a way it's a good thing
you guys lost to them.

1378
01:15:55,093 --> 01:15:58,725
If you win at the first chance,
you won't know its importance.

1379
01:16:04,905 --> 01:16:07,842
Anandhi, you're talking like Emmanuel Anna.

1380
01:16:08,179 --> 01:16:10,282
Good people speak the same frequency.

1381
01:16:10,476 --> 01:16:11,147
You idiot!

1382
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:12,905
-Oh, God!
-Yeah right!

1383
01:16:12,952 --> 01:16:14,678
-Ma!
-Come on!

1384
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:17,006
You should scream, Anandhi.

1385
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:21,146
-Hey!
-That's all you care about me.

1386
01:16:21,545 --> 01:16:22,055
Hey!

1387
01:16:23,687 --> 01:16:26,045
Look, I'm going to pinch you again.

1388
01:16:26,131 --> 01:16:28,123
You should scream, Aa-Anandhi!

1389
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:30,663
Aa-Anandhi!

1390
01:16:34,568 --> 01:16:35,217
Anandhi...

1391
01:16:36,731 --> 01:16:38,497
-Close you eyes.
-Why?

1392
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:40,319
You close your eyes and I'll tell you.

1393
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:52,405
Wow! You were right here with me crying.
When did you get this?

1394
01:16:53,945 --> 01:16:56,138
-Give it back. If don't want it.
-I want!

1395
01:16:57,521 --> 01:16:59,888
-Do you like it?
-Yes, I like it!

1396
01:17:01,231 --> 01:17:03,713
-Hereafter, don't buy anything.
-Why?

1397
01:17:04,217 --> 01:17:06,974
I'm not fond of jewellery.

1398
01:17:08,755 --> 01:17:11,145
What are you fond of?
Tell me what you like, I'll get it.

1399
01:17:12,936 --> 01:17:15,319
It's not something you can buy
from a store.

1400
01:17:17,655 --> 01:17:18,959
What is it? Hey!

1401
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:21,976
Tell me what you like.
I'll buy it for you.

1402
01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:26,522
I wish to bat at the playground.

1403
01:17:27,362 --> 01:17:28,166
Really?

1404
01:17:31,553 --> 01:17:32,482
-Come on.
-Hey!

1405
01:17:32,684 --> 01:17:34,044
-Come with me.
-Where are you taking me?

1406
01:17:34,076 --> 01:17:34,834
Come with me.

1407
01:17:50,489 --> 01:17:52,316
Rahul, let me play give me your bat.

1408
01:17:53,049 --> 01:17:54,267
Come on, play.

1409
01:17:59,506 --> 01:18:00,936
Wow, Anandhi!

1410
01:18:01,514 --> 01:18:02,130
What is it?

1411
01:19:01,668 --> 01:19:08,935
â™ª Reecho of the train
Is searching for you â™ª

1412
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:16,741
â™ª Like a ringing drum
The heart is pounding â™ª

1413
01:19:17,113 --> 01:19:21,355
â™ª Your swinging hands
Your signals â™ª

1414
01:19:21,511 --> 01:19:24,972
â™ª Is throwing me
Into the Eden garden â™ª

1415
01:19:25,486 --> 01:19:29,462
â™ª In the rails
That cross your place â™ª

1416
01:19:29,593 --> 01:19:33,084
â™ª My life seems to end â™ª

1417
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:56,534
â™ª Words that I have not even uttered
To my mother â™ª

1418
01:19:56,633 --> 01:20:01,089
â™ª Are floating in my mind â™ª

1419
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,761
â™ª Within the blanket of dreams â™ª

1420
01:20:03,816 --> 01:20:06,841
â™ª I try to stop the time... â™ª

1421
01:20:07,076 --> 01:20:09,363
â™ª ...passing by â™ª

1422
01:20:09,628 --> 01:20:15,042
â™ª Like the rain water running
on the ground... â™ª

1423
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,042
â™ª I am slipping by â™ª

1424
01:20:17,510 --> 01:20:22,697
â™ª You shower kindness on the heart
that is in pain â™ª

1425
01:20:23,142 --> 01:20:25,244
â™ª You care â™ª

1426
01:20:26,163 --> 01:20:29,863
â™ª Amongst all the redolence
that graze me... â™ª

1427
01:20:30,137 --> 01:20:33,574
â™ª Only your scent stirs my soul â™ª

1428
01:20:34,138 --> 01:20:37,942
â™ª Even after the earth vanishes
The only rail lines that do not vanish â™ª

1429
01:20:38,194 --> 01:20:41,169
â™ª ...is Love, my dear â™ª

1430
01:20:47,412 --> 01:20:49,497
â™ª My love â™ª

1431
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:57,286
â™ª My love â™ª

1432
01:21:04,614 --> 01:21:06,016
Current, you sound excited.

1433
01:21:06,878 --> 01:21:08,534
I'm nothing less than Mark Waugh.

1434
01:21:17,753 --> 01:21:19,005
Emman, hey!

1435
01:21:23,919 --> 01:21:27,520
We welcome our respected brother
Poovai Murthy...

1436
01:21:27,653 --> 01:21:32,550
on behalf of the family
and the music troupe.

1437
01:21:33,765 --> 01:21:36,697
I've heard many names in Tamilnadu

1438
01:21:36,853 --> 01:21:39,805
There's no one greater
than Poovaiyar Annan.

1439
01:21:40,058 --> 01:21:42,962
There's no one greater
than Poovaiyar Annan.

1440
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:50,348
If you did your work.
You must fight and win it.

1441
01:21:50,535 --> 01:21:52,495
Brave leaders. Be ready!

1442
01:21:52,942 --> 01:21:55,168
The future is waiting for us.

1443
01:21:55,442 --> 01:21:58,995
Kill the cowards in your hearts.

1444
01:21:59,122 --> 01:21:59,973
That's it!

1445
01:22:00,596 --> 01:22:04,587
I wish the bride and the groom
a blessed and prosperous life.

1446
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,712
Welcome, Anna.
How are you?

1447
01:22:07,873 --> 01:22:11,103
I hope the children are studying.
They should speak English fluently.

1448
01:22:11,267 --> 01:22:11,986
Hey!

1449
01:22:12,212 --> 01:22:14,774
-Hey, Sasi.
-Dude, I don't get any of it.

1450
01:22:18,402 --> 01:22:20,004
The boy who I mentioned
who is behind Anandhi....

1451
01:22:20,064 --> 01:22:21,536
-He is here with his boys.
-Who is it?

1452
01:22:21,611 --> 01:22:22,454
-is that him?
-We should not spare him.

1453
01:22:23,516 --> 01:22:24,805
The dancing guy in green shirt.

1454
01:22:25,635 --> 01:22:27,119
Come on, Anna is calling.

1455
01:22:27,499 --> 01:22:29,178
Hey, wait, bring the gift.

1456
01:22:33,962 --> 01:22:36,199
Anna, come on. This for you.

1457
01:22:36,224 --> 01:22:37,387
-Hold the gift.
-Come on!

1458
01:22:37,415 --> 01:22:40,580
-That's enough, Ranjith.
-Everyone please have your meal.

1459
01:22:40,744 --> 01:22:41,244
Hey!

1460
01:22:43,744 --> 01:22:45,040
Hey, can't you watch out?

1461
01:22:45,181 --> 01:22:46,329
How dare you?

1462
01:22:47,234 --> 01:22:48,212
I'll kill you. Where are you from?

1463
01:22:48,252 --> 01:22:49,504
Hey, don't you dare?

1464
01:22:49,828 --> 01:22:51,039
It's okay, you arrive before them.

1465
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,437
How does it matter?

1466
01:22:52,712 --> 01:22:54,000
How dare you raise your voice
in my territory?

1467
01:22:54,047 --> 01:22:55,343
Hey, what's your problem?

1468
01:22:55,791 --> 01:22:56,228
Hey!

1469
01:22:57,157 --> 01:22:59,946
Hey, son, let's not fight
during new beginnings.

1470
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:01,720
-Guys leave.
-Come with me.

1471
01:23:01,789 --> 01:23:03,937
-Can't you hear me?
-Anna, what's the problem?

1472
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:04,978
-Nothing to worry.
-Don't create problems.

1473
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:06,752
I said don't create problems.

1474
01:23:06,838 --> 01:23:08,447
I'll handle it you leave.

1475
01:23:08,526 --> 01:23:10,635
-It's best you leave.
-Come on, let's leave.

1476
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:11,859
-It's best you leave.
-I ought to!

1477
01:23:12,368 --> 01:23:14,907
I dare you to cross Arakkonam station.

1478
01:23:16,382 --> 01:23:18,140
You overthink of yourself.

1479
01:23:18,262 --> 01:23:21,587
It's better you stick to your business
shut up and leave.

1480
01:23:22,328 --> 01:23:23,825
If you don't we'll kill you!

1481
01:23:23,922 --> 01:23:26,449
Listen, don't speak out of your turn.

1482
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:27,211
Hey!

1483
01:23:28,789 --> 01:23:29,635
Shut up and leave.

1484
01:23:29,893 --> 01:23:31,923
If you don't then you won't
make it out of here.

1485
01:23:32,025 --> 01:23:33,689
Bloody, how dare you?

1486
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:35,252
Hey, don't fight!

1487
01:23:35,768 --> 01:23:36,564
Let go!

1488
01:23:37,393 --> 01:23:39,354
-Let go!
-How dare you run your mouth?

1489
01:23:39,523 --> 01:23:41,235
Hey, I'll kill you!

1490
01:23:47,884 --> 01:23:48,845
Don't bring area into it.

1491
01:23:48,924 --> 01:23:50,650
Hey, thrash him!

1492
01:23:50,721 --> 01:23:51,486
Stay right here. We'll be back!

1493
01:23:51,674 --> 01:23:54,439
Hey, please hear me out.
Hey, Rajesh!

1494
01:23:54,601 --> 01:23:56,259
Hey, Ranjith, calm down.

1495
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:59,275
Hey, why would you?
We'll sort this out in the morning.

1496
01:23:59,409 --> 01:24:01,268
Come on, let's go!

1497
01:24:01,744 --> 01:24:02,939
Go! Go safe!

1498
01:24:03,056 --> 01:24:04,369
We'll discus this in the morning.

1499
01:24:20,453 --> 01:24:21,579
Let me tell you all something.

1500
01:24:22,783 --> 01:24:25,007
They've announced a tournament at MCF.

1501
01:24:27,385 --> 01:24:30,329
Why don't you both teams
join hands and enroll?

1502
01:24:36,267 --> 01:24:38,141
If the both the teams combine...

1503
01:24:38,369 --> 01:24:40,806
no league player can defeat you.

1504
01:24:43,774 --> 01:24:47,063
Due to the incident at the ground
they fired me.

1505
01:24:49,854 --> 01:24:50,674
Are you serious?

1506
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:53,783
It's a freaking lawnmower job.

1507
01:24:54,127 --> 01:24:56,127
We need to prove our worth to them.

1508
01:24:56,415 --> 01:24:58,696
We should not spare them
for humiliating us.

1509
01:24:59,595 --> 01:25:04,672
On the day of the selection not just me
but many were humiliated.

1510
01:25:05,369 --> 01:25:06,650
My point exactly.

1511
01:25:07,845 --> 01:25:10,206
They look down on us as street players.

1512
01:25:12,759 --> 01:25:14,087
We are not to be looked down upon.

1513
01:25:14,533 --> 01:25:15,071
Huh?

1514
01:25:17,283 --> 01:25:19,431
Will you both join hands and play?

1515
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:27,181
Today when you joined hands
no one could beat you.

1516
01:25:29,915 --> 01:25:31,102
We must unite!

1517
01:25:31,539 --> 01:25:33,190
That's it! That's it!

1518
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:38,133
What do you say?

1519
01:25:45,653 --> 01:25:46,732
Please stop here.

1520
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:16,798
How could you agree
to join hands with them?

1521
01:26:17,221 --> 01:26:18,549
That too we have to play
under their team's name.

1522
01:26:18,783 --> 01:26:19,900
What's in the name?

1523
01:26:22,979 --> 01:26:25,056
Hey, Ranjith, how can we play
along with them?

1524
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,166
Let's enroll as our team and win it.

1525
01:26:27,689 --> 01:26:28,384
The hell you'll win!

1526
01:26:28,579 --> 01:26:30,814
We did observe their game.

1527
01:26:31,088 --> 01:26:32,798
Every shot looked like we watch on TV.

1528
01:26:33,102 --> 01:26:35,071
We've been yearning to play
in this tournament.

1529
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:36,696
Last time you used money to fix it.

1530
01:26:37,048 --> 01:26:38,587
Similarly, fix it for tournament too.

1531
01:26:38,938 --> 01:26:40,087
Why should we join hands with them?

1532
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:43,485
You saw what the
league players did to us.

1533
01:26:44,088 --> 01:26:47,328
If two teams join
half the players will be idle.

1534
01:26:47,931 --> 01:26:49,110
How are you going to select the players?

1535
01:26:49,224 --> 01:26:50,566
Everyone is a good player.

1536
01:26:51,251 --> 01:26:53,947
We'll be playing the cricket ball
not the cork ball.

1537
01:26:54,822 --> 01:26:56,658
I'll select players based on their
performances with cricket ball.

1538
01:26:57,401 --> 01:26:58,377
We'll know during the practice.

1539
01:26:58,752 --> 01:27:00,306
Anyway, your brother will be
on the team.

1540
01:27:00,439 --> 01:27:03,877
Of course,
the elder brother is the captain.

1541
01:27:04,026 --> 01:27:07,282
Hey, I won't be biased.

1542
01:27:07,604 --> 01:27:08,470
We must practice.

1543
01:27:08,822 --> 01:27:10,478
Best performer will play in the match.

1544
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:13,572
Even if I don't perform.
I'll step down.

1545
01:27:14,932 --> 01:27:16,518
Let's join hands with our people.

1546
01:27:16,752 --> 01:27:17,832
When did they become our people?

1547
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:21,039
Venkat, you're an important player
of this team.

1548
01:27:21,282 --> 01:27:22,493
How can you not trust me?

1549
01:27:23,377 --> 01:27:25,338
Hey, consider sports to be sports.

1550
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:28,517
Let's play one tournament.

1551
01:27:28,713 --> 01:27:29,306
Please.

1552
01:27:29,533 --> 01:27:31,486
Don't take this tournament lightly.

1553
01:27:32,908 --> 01:27:33,829
This is an opportunity.

1554
01:27:34,969 --> 01:27:35,850
We should not miss it!

1555
01:27:46,369 --> 01:27:47,525
Hey, come with me.

1556
01:27:49,778 --> 01:27:51,227
-Vanakkam, Anna.
-Welcome Rajesh.

1557
01:27:59,906 --> 01:28:00,885
What's all this?

1558
01:28:01,559 --> 01:28:02,754
Shake hands with each other.

1559
01:28:20,266 --> 01:28:22,415
Do you want individual instructions?

1560
01:28:22,524 --> 01:28:23,376
Shake hands.

1561
01:28:23,697 --> 01:28:24,683
Hey, go ahead.

1562
01:28:24,868 --> 01:28:25,485
Go ahead!

1563
01:28:29,908 --> 01:28:31,400
Ranjith and Rajesh!

1564
01:28:32,026 --> 01:28:33,494
They have printed a form
for the tournament.

1565
01:28:33,938 --> 01:28:34,806
Here, read it!

1566
01:28:38,267 --> 01:28:40,782
All the matches will be played on the mat.

1567
01:28:41,165 --> 01:28:41,726
Mat?

1568
01:28:41,818 --> 01:28:42,912
Anna, what does it mean?

1569
01:28:43,033 --> 01:28:44,468
-It says mat!
-What is a mat?

1570
01:28:44,682 --> 01:28:46,291
We're not used to play on the mat.

1571
01:28:46,510 --> 01:28:48,283
This tournament will be played on the mat.

1572
01:28:48,819 --> 01:28:50,310
Practicing is not important.

1573
01:28:50,702 --> 01:28:51,936
But we have to practice on the mat.

1574
01:28:52,266 --> 01:28:53,836
Only then you can play
with the cricket ball.

1575
01:28:54,682 --> 01:28:55,275
Okay?

1576
01:28:55,713 --> 01:28:56,869
How much is a mat?

1577
01:28:56,915 --> 01:28:58,899
To buy a second hand mat
it will cost you 2000 rupees.

1578
01:28:59,095 --> 01:28:59,696
2000?

1579
01:28:59,776 --> 01:29:01,806
Did you say 2000 rupees?

1580
01:29:01,845 --> 01:29:04,049
Anna, I'll buy the mat.

1581
01:29:04,217 --> 01:29:05,526
It is not the right thing to do.

1582
01:29:06,025 --> 01:29:07,954
It's best every one pitch in.

1583
01:29:08,362 --> 01:29:09,916
Then the mat will be owned by the team.

1584
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:11,970
Let's all pitch in and buy it.

1585
01:29:12,077 --> 01:29:14,678
Ranjith and Rajesh, at Chepaulk...

1586
01:29:14,846 --> 01:29:17,301
you can find a good deal on the
second-hand mat, Raghav says so.

1587
01:29:17,479 --> 01:29:18,481
Go over there.

1588
01:29:19,435 --> 01:29:21,439
-[in Hindi] Where are you going?
-Gurkha bhaiya!

1589
01:29:21,721 --> 01:29:24,025
-Can we buy the mat here?
-No, no! Get going.

1590
01:29:24,064 --> 01:29:25,806
How dare you ask us to leave?

1591
01:29:25,854 --> 01:29:27,252
Hey, calm down!

1592
01:29:27,759 --> 01:29:29,195
Aren't we out-of-towners too?

1593
01:29:29,712 --> 01:29:31,954
I wonder what hardship he's going through
to come here for a job.

1594
01:29:32,085 --> 01:29:33,123
And you're troubling him.

1595
01:29:33,218 --> 01:29:35,178
He can't understand matriculation
Hindi. And you expect him to get you.

1596
01:29:35,325 --> 01:29:37,059
Listen, come over here.

1597
01:29:39,195 --> 01:29:40,882
-What do you want?
-Cricket mat!

1598
01:29:41,055 --> 01:29:42,695
Are you okay with a second hand mat?

1599
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:45,663
-How much is it?
-How much do you have?

1600
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,068
First, state your price.

1601
01:29:47,366 --> 01:29:49,413
A new mat at the store is 5000 rupees.

1602
01:29:49,492 --> 01:29:51,265
I have two mats with me.

1603
01:29:51,366 --> 01:29:52,561
It'll cost you 1500 rupees.

1604
01:29:52,742 --> 01:29:54,148
It will be as good as new.

1605
01:29:54,218 --> 01:29:55,968
Super mat! Okay?

1606
01:29:56,437 --> 01:29:57,878
-What do you say?
-Okay!

1607
01:29:58,326 --> 01:29:59,415
Have you decided?

1608
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:02,051
-Okay, show us the mat.
-Come with me.

1609
01:30:02,748 --> 01:30:04,858
They're here to buy the cricket mat.

1610
01:30:05,468 --> 01:30:07,538
Listen, give 500 rupees advance.

1611
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,280
Anna, we'll check out the mat
and then pay him.

1612
01:30:09,522 --> 01:30:10,662
Pay up front if you need it.

1613
01:30:11,028 --> 01:30:12,231
If not off you go!

1614
01:30:12,834 --> 01:30:15,810
-They're thinking too much to pay.
-Fine, pay him.

1615
01:30:16,217 --> 01:30:17,474
Anna, mat should not be torn.

1616
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:19,756
We can check it out later.
First pay up advance.

1617
01:30:22,193 --> 01:30:23,357
It's all there, Anna.

1618
01:30:24,429 --> 01:30:26,233
-Don't speak too much.
-Come on, let's go!

1619
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:27,749
-That boy speaks too much.
-He's still a kid!

1620
01:30:28,124 --> 01:30:29,983
-Trust is important.
-It's a good mat.

1621
01:30:30,084 --> 01:30:32,326
-Be patient and get it.
-Ramesh!

1622
01:30:40,818 --> 01:30:41,630
Go ahead!

1623
01:30:43,732 --> 01:30:46,397
Anna, where's the mat?

1624
01:30:46,827 --> 01:30:48,171
It's over there.

1625
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:52,286
Where is it?

1626
01:30:53,723 --> 01:30:54,614
It's on the ground.

1627
01:30:59,943 --> 01:31:00,802
Can you not see it?

1628
01:31:03,068 --> 01:31:05,163
Ramesh, sell it to them.

1629
01:31:05,490 --> 01:31:06,373
I'm leaving.

1630
01:31:09,231 --> 01:31:10,178
Anna, what's this?

1631
01:31:10,725 --> 01:31:12,826
Once they clear the coffin,
take your mat.

1632
01:31:13,615 --> 01:31:14,841
Sit over there. Please wait.

1633
01:31:15,264 --> 01:31:17,350
And you expect to watch my words.

1634
01:31:17,553 --> 01:31:19,279
There's a demand for this mat.

1635
01:31:19,358 --> 01:31:20,459
Serve tea to the boys.

1636
01:31:21,256 --> 01:31:23,443
-Here you go tea!
-How long would it take?

1637
01:31:49,296 --> 01:31:51,354
-Be careful.
-Hey, hold it right!

1638
01:31:55,145 --> 01:31:57,847
-Hey, hold it tight.
-Hold it tight!

1639
01:31:57,974 --> 01:31:59,450
Hold on, we'll fix it.

1640
01:32:03,894 --> 01:32:05,738
Hey, Bharath. Go to that side.

1641
01:32:05,965 --> 01:32:08,535
-Here you say!
-Venkatesh, come to this side.

1642
01:32:08,988 --> 01:32:11,522
-Hey, I will stand here.
-Come on, bowl.

1643
01:32:16,752 --> 01:32:17,275
Hey!

1644
01:32:22,072 --> 01:32:23,505
Come on, Rajesh, bowl.

1645
01:32:24,363 --> 01:32:25,011
Rajesh!

1646
01:32:29,604 --> 01:32:30,122
Bowl!

1647
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:36,458
Everyone gather.

1648
01:32:38,208 --> 01:32:39,824
Come to the mat.
Come on!

1649
01:32:44,433 --> 01:32:45,230
What did you observe?

1650
01:32:45,819 --> 01:32:48,792
Erm.. when we bowl in sand
the ball travels low.

1651
01:32:49,247 --> 01:32:51,684
But on the mat it's fast and bounces.

1652
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,667
That's it!

1653
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:54,832
All this while we played on sand.

1654
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:57,370
-But now mat. Okay?
-We get it!

1655
01:32:57,559 --> 01:32:59,738
-We get it, Anna.
-Come on everyone.

1656
01:32:59,801 --> 01:33:02,356
Hey, come on everyone.

1657
01:33:02,504 --> 01:33:04,309
You can't hold cricket ball
like you hold a cork ball.

1658
01:33:04,606 --> 01:33:05,364
This is the stitch.

1659
01:33:05,536 --> 01:33:07,160
Your two fingers should be above it.

1660
01:33:08,538 --> 01:33:09,981
If you bowl now the ball will seam.

1661
01:33:10,083 --> 01:33:12,129
If it pitches in the seam
the ball will travel faster.

1662
01:33:14,944 --> 01:33:16,910
One is in-swing.
Another is out-swing.

1663
01:33:17,121 --> 01:33:19,421
If you hold the seam and
pitch it in it's a in-swing.

1664
01:33:19,714 --> 01:33:22,155
Likewise if you pitch it outside
it's an out-swing.

1665
01:33:22,364 --> 01:33:23,085
Understood?

1666
01:33:27,911 --> 01:33:30,241
â™ª Let you be controlled
Let you be stopped â™ª

1667
01:33:30,459 --> 01:33:32,804
â™ª Creating obstacles in your path
Let you be spoiled â™ª

1668
01:33:33,085 --> 01:33:35,428
â™ª Let you be hated
Let you be sidelined â™ª

1669
01:33:35,772 --> 01:33:37,957
â™ª To have patience, to refuse
Let it give way! â™ª

1670
01:33:38,038 --> 01:33:38,506
â™ª Come on! â™ª

1671
01:33:38,577 --> 01:33:41,254
â™ª If we go to war,
Who is there to conquer us? â™ª

1672
01:33:41,358 --> 01:33:43,803
â™ª This is Budhdha waging the war
after learning valor â™ª

1673
01:33:43,849 --> 01:33:45,270
â™ª To whom? To whom? â™ª

1674
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:46,592
â™ª We will announce to the world â™ª

1675
01:33:46,616 --> 01:33:47,981
â™ª Give us the way
As we walk â™ª

1676
01:33:48,091 --> 01:33:49,091
â™ª Quit the path
Quit the path â™ª

1677
01:33:49,147 --> 01:33:52,006
â™ª You should know who you are â™ª

1678
01:33:52,116 --> 01:33:54,568
â™ª Change is evident â™ª

1679
01:33:54,709 --> 01:33:58,769
â™ª It is enough if the elephant knows
its strength â™ª

1680
01:33:59,741 --> 01:34:02,467
â™ª You should know who you are â™ª

1681
01:34:02,655 --> 01:34:05,186
â™ª Change is evident â™ª

1682
01:34:05,351 --> 01:34:09,709
â™ª It is enough if the elephant knows
its strength â™ª

1683
01:34:10,197 --> 01:34:12,462
We're playing to defeat the Giant-11 team.

1684
01:34:13,613 --> 01:34:15,099
We should not lose to them.

1685
01:34:15,754 --> 01:34:17,504
I can understand your anger.

1686
01:34:17,848 --> 01:34:20,504
Like us they don't play twice a week.

1687
01:34:20,832 --> 01:34:22,272
They play on all the days in a week.

1688
01:34:22,653 --> 01:34:26,231
Like you perceive MCF tournament
is not so easy to play.

1689
01:34:26,678 --> 01:34:28,249
It's an important tournament.

1690
01:34:28,598 --> 01:34:30,100
If you play in this tournament,

1691
01:34:30,194 --> 01:34:32,834
you may get selected in Ranjit Trophy
or even in Indian team.

1692
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:35,107
This tournament is an eye wash.

1693
01:34:35,449 --> 01:34:37,847
To make people believe
that the selection is not biased.

1694
01:34:38,074 --> 01:34:39,699
Otherwise,
there's no other purpose to it.

1695
01:34:39,832 --> 01:34:42,262
More than winning this tournament...

1696
01:34:42,395 --> 01:34:44,288
it's a big deal to even play
in this tournament.

1697
01:34:45,770 --> 01:34:49,405
In the 5 tournaments,
11 Bullets have won twice.

1698
01:34:49,967 --> 01:34:52,465
The rest of the three years
Team Giant-11 won the trophy.

1699
01:34:53,002 --> 01:34:54,764
It's not easy to win against that team.

1700
01:34:57,082 --> 01:34:59,707
To compete with them
we need more practice.

1701
01:35:00,103 --> 01:35:01,627
Come on! Come on, boys!

1702
01:35:02,110 --> 01:35:03,227
Come on!

1703
01:35:06,692 --> 01:35:08,692
Once we lock our opponent...

1704
01:35:08,792 --> 01:35:11,219
in all aspects we need to
work more hard than them.

1705
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:14,149
The hard work will give us
courage and confidence.

1706
01:35:14,592 --> 01:35:16,951
â™ª Be patient and focused like a leopard â™ª

1707
01:35:17,292 --> 01:35:18,987
â™ª Be patient and focused like a leopard â™ª

1708
01:35:19,052 --> 01:35:20,417
Super ball. Sam, great bowling!

1709
01:35:20,464 --> 01:35:22,362
â™ª Be patient and focused like a leopard â™ª

1710
01:35:22,534 --> 01:35:25,121
â™ª We are the birds
That begins the war â™ª

1711
01:35:25,246 --> 01:35:27,519
â™ª If you understand,
Even a drop becomes an ocean â™ª

1712
01:35:27,659 --> 01:35:30,526
â™ª Let us hold our heads high
And surprise everyone â™ª

1713
01:35:30,653 --> 01:35:33,026
â™ª Seeing your game,
Let us oppressors become silent â™ª

1714
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:35,731
â™ª Game is also a challenge for you â™ª

1715
01:35:35,889 --> 01:35:38,443
â™ª Donâ€™t be submissive
Do not let your heart break â™ª

1716
01:35:38,514 --> 01:35:39,901
â™ª Take the first step
Prove them wrong â™ª

1717
01:35:39,933 --> 01:35:41,026
â™ª Keep repeating it â™ª

1718
01:35:41,298 --> 01:35:42,345
â™ª Give us the way
As we walk â™ª

1719
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:43,589
â™ª Quit the path
Quit the path â™ª

1720
01:35:43,846 --> 01:35:46,502
â™ª You should know who you are â™ª

1721
01:35:46,604 --> 01:35:49,330
â™ª Change is evident â™ª

1722
01:35:49,457 --> 01:35:53,480
â™ª It is enough if the elephant knows
its strength â™ª

1723
01:35:54,489 --> 01:35:57,332
â™ª You should know who you are â™ª

1724
01:35:57,527 --> 01:36:00,050
â™ª Change is evident â™ª

1725
01:36:00,167 --> 01:36:04,338
â™ª It is enough if the elephant knows
its strength â™ª

1726
01:36:27,547 --> 01:36:28,972
-Thamizh machan.
-Hey, that's my cousin.

1727
01:36:29,019 --> 01:36:30,909
-That's my cousin.
-Hey, Venkat!

1728
01:36:31,231 --> 01:36:33,069
Hey, have you teamed up with them?

1729
01:36:34,391 --> 01:36:35,196
I told you!

1730
01:36:37,191 --> 01:36:38,167
Come on, let's go!

1731
01:36:38,941 --> 01:36:40,314
Team Blue Star and Sputnik...

1732
01:36:40,430 --> 01:36:43,455
Please come to the field
to spin the toss.

1733
01:36:44,712 --> 01:36:46,277
Rajesh, you go.

1734
01:36:51,386 --> 01:36:52,596
Let's win the toss.

1735
01:36:53,434 --> 01:36:53,949
Tail!

1736
01:36:57,778 --> 01:36:59,332
-Hey, that's super.
-I picked batting.

1737
01:36:59,473 --> 01:37:00,376
Who do we send as openers?

1738
01:37:01,370 --> 01:37:02,269
Let Babu and Venkat open.

1739
01:37:02,294 --> 01:37:04,262
Venkatesh and Babu are going to open.

1740
01:37:04,333 --> 01:37:06,020
The first ball has been bowled.

1741
01:37:06,199 --> 01:37:09,072
Venkatesh is playing stroke.

1742
01:37:09,135 --> 01:37:10,924
-He's a pro at playing stroke.
-Is he good bowler?

1743
01:37:11,327 --> 01:37:12,795
Nah, I'm just whiling away time.

1744
01:37:12,975 --> 01:37:13,952
You play well, don't you?

1745
01:37:16,999 --> 01:37:18,374
That's a fantastic ball.

1746
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:20,393
Hey, let's go for another run.

1747
01:37:20,732 --> 01:37:23,780
There goes a wicket for Blue Star.

1748
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:25,319
He got him out on purpose.

1749
01:37:26,414 --> 01:37:28,804
Fantastic!
Keep up the bowling.

1750
01:37:30,866 --> 01:37:33,671
In 2 overs, 2 wickets and 2 runs.

1751
01:37:33,787 --> 01:37:34,810
Ranjith, come on, play.

1752
01:37:34,913 --> 01:37:36,420
Ranjith is down for batting.

1753
01:37:37,054 --> 01:37:38,720
That's a wide ball.

1754
01:37:39,045 --> 01:37:40,967
Next ball... That's a great ball.

1755
01:37:42,578 --> 01:37:43,498
That's a four!

1756
01:37:44,412 --> 01:37:46,201
Excellent shot, Ranjith!

1757
01:37:46,266 --> 01:37:47,496
Hey, maintain this.

1758
01:37:50,054 --> 01:37:53,025
Ranjith's first ball fetched him
a boundary.

1759
01:37:53,468 --> 01:37:54,725
Hey, come on!

1760
01:37:54,767 --> 01:37:56,288
Hey. Venkat, make the run.

1761
01:37:59,209 --> 01:38:00,515
Why the hell is he not running?

1762
01:38:00,835 --> 01:38:02,342
-He will do it.
-That was an easy run.

1763
01:38:02,397 --> 01:38:03,623
I won't run for it.

1764
01:38:04,475 --> 01:38:05,935
Suriya's last ball.

1765
01:38:06,139 --> 01:38:08,210
Hey, don't come. Go back!

1766
01:38:08,247 --> 01:38:09,375
Throw it here!

1767
01:38:09,422 --> 01:38:11,061
-Howzzzat!
-They got the ball.

1768
01:38:11,257 --> 01:38:14,069
-In 3 overs, 7 runs, and 2 wickets...
-He picked up the ball.

1769
01:38:14,140 --> 01:38:15,013
...team Blue Star.

1770
01:38:15,070 --> 01:38:17,179
-Why did you run?
-He did it on purpose.

1771
01:38:17,288 --> 01:38:19,163
That's why I asked to bat.

1772
01:38:19,233 --> 01:38:21,725
But you let an outsider play.

1773
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:23,444
Hey, don't you dare call us outsiders.

1774
01:38:23,562 --> 01:38:24,389
This is our team.

1775
01:38:24,765 --> 01:38:26,513
But you clanged on to win the match.

1776
01:38:26,641 --> 01:38:28,890
It won't work
if the partnership is not correct.

1777
01:38:29,406 --> 01:38:31,694
Ranjith is ready to face the next ball.

1778
01:38:33,695 --> 01:38:36,407
â™ª Back on the streets
Are the Blue Star Boys â™ª

1779
01:38:36,595 --> 01:38:38,593
â™ª Who's got the balls?
Who's got theâ€¦ â™ª

1780
01:38:38,656 --> 01:38:39,247
â™ª ...Yeah! â™ª

1781
01:38:39,273 --> 01:38:41,922
â™ª Back on the streets
Are the Blue Star Boys â™ª

1782
01:38:41,978 --> 01:38:43,812
â™ª Who's got the balls?
Who's got theâ€¦ â™ª

1783
01:38:43,873 --> 01:38:44,555
â™ª ...Yeah! â™ª

1784
01:38:44,611 --> 01:38:45,672
â™ª You guys are a no-ball â™ª

1785
01:38:45,758 --> 01:38:48,280
â™ª Declared by the dude, Gopal â™ª

1786
01:38:49,972 --> 01:38:50,962
â™ª This's a law-ball â™ª

1787
01:38:51,057 --> 01:38:53,640
â™ª A game-changing Blue Ball â™ª
-Good game!

1788
01:38:54,556 --> 01:38:57,093
â™ª We're gonna play
Cricket... Cricket... Bro! â™ª

1789
01:38:57,251 --> 01:38:59,117
â™ª We won't go astray â™ª

1790
01:38:59,142 --> 01:39:00,192
â™ª At twenty-two yards... â™ª

1791
01:39:00,244 --> 01:39:01,758
â™ª ...we're the Cricket Guards â™ª

1792
01:39:01,885 --> 01:39:04,079
â™ª We're the Gully Gang boys
Now coming like a Boss â™ª

1793
01:39:04,196 --> 01:39:05,508
Ey! Who's the new player
on the field?

1794
01:39:05,548 --> 01:39:06,562
â™ª Blue Star! â™ª

1795
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:08,228
â™ª Everything quakes
When the Chief arrives â™ª

1796
01:39:08,273 --> 01:39:09,217
â™ª Blue Star! â™ª

1797
01:39:09,259 --> 01:39:10,835
â™ª Even foes tremble in fear â™ª

1798
01:39:10,899 --> 01:39:11,782
â™ª Blue Star! â™ª

1799
01:39:11,829 --> 01:39:13,500
â™ª Fireworks will rain â™ª

1800
01:39:13,564 --> 01:39:14,470
â™ª Blue Star! â™ª

1801
01:39:14,498 --> 01:39:16,171
â™ª There's none but us! â™ª

1802
01:39:16,637 --> 01:39:17,764
â™ª Make them play
Make them run â™ª

1803
01:39:17,833 --> 01:39:19,075
â™ª Sending people to look for them... â™ª

1804
01:39:19,132 --> 01:39:20,395
â™ª You messed with the wrong bunch â™ª

1805
01:39:20,466 --> 01:39:21,934
â™ª It's a different kinda Cricket! â™ª

1806
01:39:21,995 --> 01:39:23,387
â™ª A kind, hard-to-comprehend â™ª

1807
01:39:23,473 --> 01:39:24,473
â™ª Try figuring it out â™ª

1808
01:39:24,525 --> 01:39:25,853
â™ª Lock horns if you dare â™ª

1809
01:39:25,909 --> 01:39:27,343
â™ª It's a Blue Star Cricket â™ª

1810
01:39:27,405 --> 01:39:31,280
125 runs, 5 wickets in 16 overs.

1811
01:39:32,970 --> 01:39:35,084
Will the Sputnik team achieve this target?

1812
01:39:35,435 --> 01:39:37,640
Let's wait and watch
if they'll achieve the target.

1813
01:39:41,733 --> 01:39:43,548
You go straight.
You go to the mid-off.

1814
01:39:43,616 --> 01:39:46,921
The opening batsmen from
Sputnik are Parthiban and Sathish.

1815
01:39:48,921 --> 01:39:50,342
-Hey, catch it.
-Throw it!

1816
01:39:50,524 --> 01:39:51,455
Well fielding!

1817
01:39:51,491 --> 01:39:53,084
It's a tight fielding by Blue Star.

1818
01:39:53,405 --> 01:39:54,366
Rajesh bowls again.

1819
01:39:55,061 --> 01:39:56,271
Howzzat!

1820
01:39:57,194 --> 01:39:59,194
Sputnik lost their first wicket.

1821
01:39:59,257 --> 01:40:01,499
Next batsmen, Surya.
And bowler, Bharath!

1822
01:40:01,570 --> 01:40:03,131
Good length!

1823
01:40:03,225 --> 01:40:05,310
Looks like a maiden over.
Oh, bowled!

1824
01:40:06,109 --> 01:40:10,443
In 4 overs, 2 wickets down,
and is at only 6 runs.

1825
01:40:12,851 --> 01:40:14,107
Dinesh is batting.

1826
01:40:14,641 --> 01:40:15,531
Sixer!

1827
01:40:16,529 --> 01:40:17,420
Oh!

1828
01:40:18,311 --> 01:40:19,880
It was my ball.
Why did you come for it?

1829
01:40:19,937 --> 01:40:21,030
Scram! Stop yelling.

1830
01:40:21,077 --> 01:40:22,711
Amazing partnership between
Dinesh and Surya.

1831
01:40:22,840 --> 01:40:24,489
-Hey!-Another boundary!

1832
01:40:24,514 --> 01:40:25,866
Hey, Venkatesh!

1833
01:40:27,278 --> 01:40:29,919
-Go to the end.
-I don't have to listen to you.

1834
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:31,467
Let the captain say it.

1835
01:40:34,428 --> 01:40:35,888
Hey, like he said. Go to the end.

1836
01:40:37,975 --> 01:40:40,068
The batting is in full form.

1837
01:40:40,185 --> 01:40:42,335
In 12 overs, the score is at 95 runs.

1838
01:40:42,444 --> 01:40:44,045
Hey, catch! Catch!

1839
01:40:44,194 --> 01:40:45,506
Leave it!

1840
01:40:45,765 --> 01:40:47,866
-They dropped the catch.
-That was my ball.

1841
01:40:47,952 --> 01:40:50,077
The players are indulging
in useless arguments.

1842
01:40:50,585 --> 01:40:51,420
What the hell?

1843
01:40:51,445 --> 01:40:53,069
I told you it was my catch!

1844
01:40:53,116 --> 01:40:54,874
-How dare you?
-Why are you fighting?

1845
01:40:54,922 --> 01:40:57,867
-Go and play.-Team Blue Star has no unity.

1846
01:40:58,101 --> 01:41:01,053
Had they broken their partnership,
they would've won.

1847
01:41:01,187 --> 01:41:03,257
Last over 14 runs needed.

1848
01:41:03,304 --> 01:41:05,312
They're at 111 runs in 15 overs.

1849
01:41:05,366 --> 01:41:07,249
-Hey, Ravi, throw it in.
-Okay.

1850
01:41:07,364 --> 01:41:09,873
-Okay, go.
-Rajesh, let Bharath bowl.

1851
01:41:12,053 --> 01:41:12,640
Fine by me.

1852
01:41:12,859 --> 01:41:13,427
Bharath!

1853
01:41:13,844 --> 01:41:14,562
Bowl well.

1854
01:41:14,725 --> 01:41:15,796
Checkout the scoreboard.

1855
01:41:15,989 --> 01:41:17,656
-Bowl well.
-Ravi, give me the ball.

1856
01:41:17,762 --> 01:41:19,363
-Hey, give me the ball.
-They've changed the bowler.

1857
01:41:19,388 --> 01:41:21,350
-Bharath is going to bowl.
-Come on, Bharath!

1858
01:41:22,927 --> 01:41:23,864
First ball!

1859
01:41:25,967 --> 01:41:28,121
-Catch it.
-Sixer!

1860
01:41:28,856 --> 01:41:30,388
First ball, six runs!

1861
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:31,841
I think the match will end soon.

1862
01:41:33,222 --> 01:41:35,372
That's a four! Boundary!

1863
01:41:35,412 --> 01:41:36,950
The length is correct.
But keep it offside.

1864
01:41:38,427 --> 01:41:39,981
He's good with leg side.
You go to the boundary.

1865
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:44,191
The Sputnik Team needs 4 runs
to win this match.

1866
01:41:44,427 --> 01:41:45,308
Next ball...

1867
01:41:47,014 --> 01:41:48,709
Well bowled, Bharath!

1868
01:41:48,827 --> 01:41:50,318
What is it? What?

1869
01:41:51,358 --> 01:41:53,131
Bharath, let it go.

1870
01:41:53,217 --> 01:41:55,772
-Go ahead and bowl-Come on, Sputnik team.

1871
01:41:55,856 --> 01:41:58,093
You have a great winning opportunity.

1872
01:41:58,327 --> 01:41:59,366
Again, Bharath!

1873
01:42:02,084 --> 01:42:03,857
We're waiting to see what happens next.

1874
01:42:04,427 --> 01:42:05,286
Catch it!

1875
01:42:09,812 --> 01:42:12,344
That was a fantastic catch
by Rajesh.

1876
01:42:13,518 --> 01:42:15,081
They need 3 runs in 1 ball.

1877
01:42:15,221 --> 01:42:18,027
2 runs will be a draw.
And 3 runs will fetch them victory.

1878
01:42:18,267 --> 01:42:19,787
-Bharath is about to bowl.
-Hey, Bharath!

1879
01:42:19,819 --> 01:42:21,764
Throw a short ball.
He plays only one shot.

1880
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:22,958
Keep it offside.

1881
01:42:23,044 --> 01:42:24,809
Techniques should've been used earlier,
not now.

1882
01:42:25,919 --> 01:42:26,856
Come on, Bharath!

1883
01:42:27,613 --> 01:42:29,707
Bharath, bowling from Thiruteni corner.

1884
01:42:33,146 --> 01:42:35,074
-Suriya hit a shot.
-Hey! Hey!

1885
01:42:35,246 --> 01:42:36,612
Keep it right! Keep it right.

1886
01:42:36,739 --> 01:42:38,302
-Venkatesh missed it.
-Throw it to keeper.

1887
01:42:38,357 --> 01:42:39,997
Throw it over here.

1888
01:42:40,412 --> 01:42:41,208
Hit it!

1889
01:42:42,393 --> 01:42:44,316
-Howzzat!
-Out!

1890
01:42:44,956 --> 01:42:45,971
Verdict is out!

1891
01:42:46,364 --> 01:42:51,745
Team Blue Star has won the match by 1 run
and is moving up in the league.

1892
01:42:53,566 --> 01:42:56,070
-I'm leaving.
-Come on, hurry up!

1893
01:42:58,669 --> 01:42:59,387
Let's go!

1894
01:43:05,831 --> 01:43:06,807
-Come in, Rajesh.
-Mama!

1895
01:43:06,973 --> 01:43:08,152
-Did you call for me?
-Yes!

1896
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:11,426
I heard you're playing
in the MCF tournament.

1897
01:43:11,652 --> 01:43:12,535
Yes!

1898
01:43:13,067 --> 01:43:14,864
But why did join hands with them?

1899
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:19,269
Tell me what kind of league players
you want.

1900
01:43:19,659 --> 01:43:20,941
I'll get them for you!

1901
01:43:21,252 --> 01:43:23,777
Mama, if both the teams
play together we'll win.

1902
01:43:23,857 --> 01:43:25,997
Hey, what is it?

1903
01:43:27,556 --> 01:43:29,278
Don't you understand?

1904
01:43:29,386 --> 01:43:31,644
I'll make sure no one plays cricket
in the town.

1905
01:43:34,489 --> 01:43:37,348
Anna, first, we'll see if they stay united.

1906
01:44:19,615 --> 01:44:20,295
Hey!

1907
01:44:20,475 --> 01:44:22,225
What happened?
Where are you going?

1908
01:44:22,319 --> 01:44:23,817
It's not time yet.

1909
01:44:25,570 --> 01:44:26,558
Where were you?

1910
01:44:28,449 --> 01:44:30,952
I'm talking to you.
Have you gone deaf?

1911
01:44:32,663 --> 01:44:33,350
Hey!

1912
01:44:35,664 --> 01:44:36,898
Hey, have some coffee.

1913
01:44:37,507 --> 01:44:38,710
He is my grandson.

1914
01:44:38,773 --> 01:44:40,340
To him, education is life!

1915
01:44:40,732 --> 01:44:43,171
I concur he will only stop
once he becomes a Collector.

1916
01:44:43,898 --> 01:44:45,718
You don't feel like meeting me,
do you?

1917
01:44:45,914 --> 01:44:47,179
Hey, Ranjth, what happened?

1918
01:44:47,272 --> 01:44:48,725
Why are you sitting out here?
Let's go.

1919
01:44:51,710 --> 01:44:52,366
Nothing happened!

1920
01:45:21,508 --> 01:45:22,723
Why didn't you come for practice?

1921
01:45:22,867 --> 01:45:23,992
-Hey, Sam!
-I'm speaking to you.

1922
01:45:24,516 --> 01:45:25,937
Why are you taking it apart?

1923
01:45:26,116 --> 01:45:27,585
Hey, I'm speaking to you.

1924
01:45:28,069 --> 01:45:29,272
Why is he using my stuff?

1925
01:45:29,336 --> 01:45:30,913
-I don't touch his stuff.
-He's your brother.

1926
01:45:31,172 --> 01:45:32,484
-What's wrong with you?
-What are you doing?

1927
01:45:32,577 --> 01:45:34,647
Hey, why are you undoing the thread?
Give it to me.

1928
01:45:34,781 --> 01:45:36,640
Hey, why do you use my stuff?

1929
01:45:36,726 --> 01:45:38,726
-Sam! Sam!
-Hey, it's my wish!

1930
01:45:38,805 --> 01:45:39,965
I'll come if I feel like.

1931
01:45:40,124 --> 01:45:41,780
If you say something,
I'll kill you!

1932
01:45:41,882 --> 01:45:43,601
How dare you?

1933
01:45:43,656 --> 01:45:45,679
Just for a bat you'll beat your brother.

1934
01:45:45,828 --> 01:45:47,637
Hey, Sam!

1935
01:45:47,843 --> 01:45:49,999
Hey, Ranjith! Ranjith hear me out.

1936
01:45:50,093 --> 01:45:51,562
He can't take our beatings!

1937
01:45:51,624 --> 01:45:54,015
-I'll break your jaw.
-Break it off!

1938
01:45:54,141 --> 01:45:55,609
-I said break it off.
-Why is he beating him?

1939
01:45:55,703 --> 01:45:57,031
How dare you?

1940
01:45:57,101 --> 01:45:59,015
-I'm being patient with you.
-Don't do it. I said, don't do it.

1941
01:45:59,187 --> 01:46:02,059
-Hey, Ranjith. That's enough.
-I'll break your hands.

1942
01:46:02,508 --> 01:46:04,312
-I'm warning you!
-Hey, go away!

1943
01:46:04,413 --> 01:46:05,671
He's a small child!

1944
01:46:06,139 --> 01:46:08,693
Let your father come.
I will handle you guys then.

1945
01:46:14,606 --> 01:46:16,419
Did he beat you hard?

1946
01:46:16,617 --> 01:46:17,655
Listen, Sam!

1947
01:46:17,771 --> 01:46:19,818
-Son, please listen.
-Sam!

1948
01:46:22,770 --> 01:46:24,012
I'm shivering!

1949
01:46:24,919 --> 01:46:27,636
Is this why you guys are crazy
about cricket?

1950
01:46:42,350 --> 01:46:44,686
-I've been looking for you.
-I wonder how they drink this?

1951
01:46:44,906 --> 01:46:47,179
Sam, you're already soft.

1952
01:46:47,553 --> 01:46:49,287
Hear me out. Don't drink.
It'll be embarrassing.

1953
01:46:49,351 --> 01:46:52,117
Hey, to whom it'll be embarrassing?

1954
01:46:52,538 --> 01:46:55,038
Without me you would've lost.

1955
01:46:55,234 --> 01:46:56,670
At least I'm having a beer.

1956
01:46:56,968 --> 01:47:00,718
For losing the tournament my brother
and Rajesh will have poison.

1957
01:47:00,952 --> 01:47:02,820
Go and save them.

1958
01:47:03,031 --> 01:47:03,483
Go!

1959
01:47:03,842 --> 01:47:05,842
Hey, who said we lost.

1960
01:47:08,491 --> 01:47:10,855
Hey, Ranjith! Where's Sam?

1961
01:47:11,297 --> 01:47:12,270
He won't come.

1962
01:47:12,507 --> 01:47:13,788
How can you be so casual about it?

1963
01:47:13,991 --> 01:47:15,420
Sam was doing well.
What happened to him?

1964
01:47:16,105 --> 01:47:16,699
We'll handle it!

1965
01:47:17,059 --> 01:47:17,648
Where did he go?

1966
01:47:17,727 --> 01:47:19,484
Sevapaer team opened strong!

1967
01:47:19,858 --> 01:47:21,646
2 overs 24 runs.

1968
01:47:21,859 --> 01:47:24,541
-Zero wickets.
-Howzzat!

1969
01:47:25,274 --> 01:47:26,443
Rajesh bowled third over.

1970
01:47:27,076 --> 01:47:28,263
A clean tip on the bat.

1971
01:47:28,411 --> 01:47:30,837
-Ranjith got the catch.
-Howzzat!

1972
01:47:31,521 --> 01:47:33,458
-Sir, that's an out, sir.-Umpire denied it.

1973
01:47:33,637 --> 01:47:34,754
We thought it was a one-off.

1974
01:47:35,249 --> 01:47:37,670
For Bharath, the umpire gave a wide
for a non-wide ball.

1975
01:47:37,765 --> 01:47:39,765
After that, he kept giving wide
for all the balls.

1976
01:47:40,303 --> 01:47:42,201
Your brother did an amazing stumping!

1977
01:47:42,937 --> 01:47:44,023
Howzzat!

1978
01:47:44,085 --> 01:47:45,476
But the umpire did not approve it.

1979
01:47:45,694 --> 01:47:48,053
-Sir that's a out!
-He did not step in.

1980
01:47:48,194 --> 01:47:48,975
Why did you let it go?

1981
01:47:49,093 --> 01:47:50,921
What else can we do?

1982
01:47:51,069 --> 01:47:52,420
The organizers was yelling.

1983
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:54,874
Then Rajesh and Bharath
tightened the bowling.

1984
01:47:55,101 --> 01:47:57,366
Still they made 110 runs.

1985
01:47:57,609 --> 01:47:58,343
We didn't give up!

1986
01:47:58,513 --> 01:48:00,396
Current and I opened and scored
a lot of runs.

1987
01:48:00,805 --> 01:48:02,312
Hey....

1988
01:48:02,366 --> 01:48:03,132
You don't believe me, right?

1989
01:48:03,742 --> 01:48:05,593
I swear. You can ask anyone.

1990
01:48:05,905 --> 01:48:07,139
Our partnership was rocking.

1991
01:48:07,281 --> 01:48:09,203
Current was not out.
But the umpire gave out!

1992
01:48:10,148 --> 01:48:12,142
After that, we kept losing wickets.

1993
01:48:12,470 --> 01:48:13,186
You should've been there.

1994
01:48:13,428 --> 01:48:15,521
Then who played?

1995
01:48:16,254 --> 01:48:17,494
Ranjith is about to bat.

1996
01:48:17,757 --> 01:48:20,140
Your brother and Rajesh played.

1997
01:48:20,994 --> 01:48:24,293
Very good. Square cut.
Smashing shot.

1998
01:48:28,882 --> 01:48:31,030
-What happened next?
-Then Rajesh played.

1999
01:48:31,125 --> 01:48:32,648
The ball went over his head.
It was a clean no-ball.

2000
01:48:32,812 --> 01:48:33,656
But umpire said it's not.

2001
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:35,436
Your brother and Rajesh did not agree.

2002
01:48:35,539 --> 01:48:38,314
We were talking and the opponent
team player pushed your brother.

2003
01:48:38,623 --> 01:48:41,600
Then both the teams stepped into the field.

2004
01:48:42,074 --> 01:48:43,488
A huge fight broke out!

2005
01:48:44,429 --> 01:48:46,348
Why is there an umpire?
Let's put a toss.

2006
01:48:46,484 --> 01:48:47,937
Whoever wins the toss is the winner.

2007
01:48:48,209 --> 01:48:49,406
Why should we play toss?

2008
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:50,389
We won't agree.

2009
01:48:50,578 --> 01:48:52,765
If they're talented
then play a game and win.

2010
01:48:52,905 --> 01:48:54,342
Hey, arrogance is it?

2011
01:48:54,708 --> 01:48:56,973
What Anand? Arrogance it is!

2012
01:48:57,976 --> 01:48:59,468
I'm not an employee here anymore.

2013
01:48:59,921 --> 01:49:01,262
To listen to your nonsense.

2014
01:49:02,632 --> 01:49:05,015
Give respect and take respect.

2015
01:49:07,421 --> 01:49:09,788
Stating this as an excuse
they said both teams can't play.

2016
01:49:09,866 --> 01:49:11,076
And asked us to get out.

2017
01:49:11,201 --> 01:49:12,294
They did not budge!

2018
01:49:12,875 --> 01:49:14,445
You know what your brother did?

2019
01:49:31,015 --> 01:49:32,578
Come on! Everyone sit down.

2020
01:49:35,694 --> 01:49:36,999
Sir, they're asking to change the umpire.

2021
01:49:37,055 --> 01:49:38,257
Sir, the issue is going out of control.

2022
01:49:38,335 --> 01:49:39,437
I don't care do as you please!

2023
01:49:39,516 --> 01:49:41,679
Then they changed the umpire.

2024
01:49:41,843 --> 01:49:43,054
A new umpire was sent in.

2025
01:49:43,171 --> 01:49:44,475
After that the match resumed.

2026
01:49:47,288 --> 01:49:49,303
Rajesh and Ranjth's partnership
won the match.

2027
01:49:51,633 --> 01:49:54,085
Then why did they overdo it
in the last match?

2028
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:56,960
We did win his match.
But their attitude did not change.

2029
01:49:59,788 --> 01:50:00,912
Hereafter, Ranjith is captain.

2030
01:50:04,231 --> 01:50:06,459
Hey, no need. It's going well.

2031
01:50:06,547 --> 01:50:08,663
You assigned bowling to Bharath
at the right time.

2032
01:50:08,733 --> 01:50:10,529
And you changed the fielding
at the right time.

2033
01:50:11,179 --> 01:50:12,772
Also, you stayed longer on the pitch.

2034
01:50:13,177 --> 01:50:14,005
You are a captain.

2035
01:50:14,662 --> 01:50:15,552
It's the right thing to do.

2036
01:50:18,219 --> 01:50:19,453
If you were there,
it was an easy win.

2037
01:50:20,125 --> 01:50:21,335
You better come for practice tomorrow.

2038
01:50:21,687 --> 01:50:22,640
I'll speak to them.

2039
01:50:23,273 --> 01:50:23,859
Get lost!

2040
01:50:24,930 --> 01:50:26,163
I'm not coming.

2041
01:50:28,109 --> 01:50:29,781
I care a damn about you people.

2042
01:50:31,793 --> 01:50:34,777
I came to meet you. You could've
bought an extra beer.

2043
01:50:37,676 --> 01:50:38,623
Hey, come over here.

2044
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:42,905
Sam, why are you not
pressing your clothes?

2045
01:50:43,242 --> 01:50:44,437
Are you not well?

2046
01:50:44,632 --> 01:50:45,929
Playing deaf is it?

2047
01:50:46,039 --> 01:50:48,242
Sam I brought you breakfast.

2048
01:50:48,373 --> 01:50:49,444
Please eat.

2049
01:50:49,531 --> 01:50:51,879
Your pampering has spoiled him.

2050
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:03,515
Ma!

2051
01:51:05,460 --> 01:51:06,078
Come in!

2052
01:51:06,475 --> 01:51:07,733
Come in and sit down.

2053
01:51:07,976 --> 01:51:09,062
Here, open your month.

2054
01:51:09,609 --> 01:51:10,554
Drink some water.

2055
01:51:10,633 --> 01:51:12,437
I will pay on Saturday.

2056
01:51:12,789 --> 01:51:14,390
I'm not here for that.

2057
01:51:14,702 --> 01:51:16,367
-I came to meet Sam.
-Oh!

2058
01:51:16,655 --> 01:51:18,030
Sit down. Would you like
to have breakfast?

2059
01:51:18,108 --> 01:51:19,381
No thanks. I had.

2060
01:51:20,171 --> 01:51:21,553
-You came to meet him?
-Yes!

2061
01:51:21,641 --> 01:51:23,593
He's being stubborn and difficult.

2062
01:51:23,653 --> 01:51:24,395
Have more.

2063
01:51:26,499 --> 01:51:29,171
-What are you doing?
-I found him at the ground...

2064
01:51:29,539 --> 01:51:31,445
he was hurt,
so I brought him home.

2065
01:51:32,883 --> 01:51:35,218
Sam, why did you not
come to the match yesterday?

2066
01:51:36,570 --> 01:51:37,351
I'm talking to you.

2067
01:51:37,739 --> 01:51:38,856
Had you been there,
it would've been great.

2068
01:51:38,999 --> 01:51:41,670
Hey, he came all the way
to meet you.

2069
01:51:42,006 --> 01:51:42,966
Give him a reply.

2070
01:51:43,429 --> 01:51:44,288
I never promised.

2071
01:51:44,733 --> 01:51:47,514
Why are you being rude to mom?

2072
01:51:47,797 --> 01:51:50,007
Damn it! You escaped last time.

2073
01:51:50,233 --> 01:51:51,991
-It's best you pipe down.
-Calm down.

2074
01:51:52,499 --> 01:51:54,803
They don't even let him
eat in peace.

2075
01:51:54,898 --> 01:51:56,671
Tomorrow's match is important.
It's semi-finals.

2076
01:51:56,851 --> 01:51:57,577
You have to come.

2077
01:51:57,741 --> 01:52:00,077
I'm not coming.
You can take someone else.

2078
01:52:00,242 --> 01:52:01,421
-Sam.
-What is it gran?

2079
01:52:01,516 --> 01:52:03,460
You said it was over.

2080
01:52:04,164 --> 01:52:06,233
I bought it for you.
Use it.

2081
01:52:06,352 --> 01:52:07,435
The old hag is embarrassing me.

2082
01:52:09,930 --> 01:52:11,617
Gran, don't piss me off.

2083
01:52:11,711 --> 01:52:13,406
Hey, Sam, please hear me out.

2084
01:52:13,562 --> 01:52:14,530
Tomorrow you have to come.

2085
01:52:14,578 --> 01:52:18,007
I told you, right?
He's the oddball in this house.

2086
01:52:18,601 --> 01:52:20,429
You carry on. I'll convince him.

2087
01:52:20,812 --> 01:52:21,530
We'll manage!

2088
01:52:21,999 --> 01:52:24,171
-It's getting late. Come to practice.
-I'll come.

2089
01:52:26,897 --> 01:52:29,078
-Hey, it's Sam.
-Where was he all this while?

2090
01:52:29,406 --> 01:52:30,718
Wait let me talk to him.

2091
01:52:31,492 --> 01:52:32,116
Sam!

2092
01:52:33,258 --> 01:52:34,124
Sam, stop right there!

2093
01:52:40,069 --> 01:52:40,608
Take this.

2094
01:52:42,726 --> 01:52:43,931
Give this letter to your brother.

2095
01:52:44,203 --> 01:52:45,577
What?

2096
01:52:45,772 --> 01:52:47,571
In the end,
you made me the messenger.

2097
01:52:48,242 --> 01:52:50,187
First read what's in the letter.

2098
01:52:51,953 --> 01:52:52,593
Read it!

2099
01:52:57,258 --> 01:52:59,976
To my beloved lover, Ranjith...

2100
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:02,140
Anandhi...

2101
01:53:02,695 --> 01:53:03,804
Anandhi?

2102
01:53:07,508 --> 01:53:10,921
Hey, what about the letter
you gave my brother?

2103
01:53:11,656 --> 01:53:13,444
On that day, too,
Anandhi asked me to pass the letter.

2104
01:53:15,459 --> 01:53:16,154
Damn!

2105
01:53:18,172 --> 01:53:19,460
I'm leaving. Let's go!

2106
01:53:19,929 --> 01:53:21,264
Hey! Hey, Thaen!

2107
01:53:22,148 --> 01:53:22,701
Thaen!

2108
01:53:24,203 --> 01:53:24,836
What is it?

2109
01:53:26,078 --> 01:53:28,078
Why is that you don't understand
my feeling?

2110
01:53:29,499 --> 01:53:31,499
How long do you expect me to wait?

2111
01:53:31,601 --> 01:53:33,624
Next month 7th is your birthday.

2112
01:53:35,078 --> 01:53:35,916
I will give you my answer.

2113
01:53:36,156 --> 01:53:38,249
How come you remember
my birthday?

2114
01:53:38,616 --> 01:53:42,642
Every year you distribute chocolate
and pin a poem with it.

2115
01:53:43,874 --> 01:53:44,593
I've read it!

2116
01:53:44,679 --> 01:53:47,358
You've never read my letter.

2117
01:53:47,476 --> 01:53:49,030
I wonder how you read my poems.

2118
01:53:49,281 --> 01:53:50,960
You don't spare any festivals.

2119
01:53:51,476 --> 01:53:54,249
You even give me a card on
death anniversary holidays.

2120
01:53:54,483 --> 01:53:55,491
I've read them all.

2121
01:53:55,812 --> 01:53:58,101
I remember the poem
from your last birthday.

2122
01:53:58,882 --> 01:53:59,976
Shall I recite it?

2123
01:54:01,055 --> 01:54:02,398
"How many are aware?"

2124
01:54:02,875 --> 01:54:05,515
"You are the December flower
that bloomed in November."

2125
01:54:05,749 --> 01:54:07,749
How do you even come up
with these poems?

2126
01:54:09,843 --> 01:54:12,177
I've never seen you smile
like this before.

2127
01:54:13,552 --> 01:54:14,778
Hey, forget about it.

2128
01:54:15,460 --> 01:54:16,897
Do you even have feelings?

2129
01:54:17,609 --> 01:54:20,296
Anandhi looked sad
when she gave me the letter.

2130
01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:23,640
Hey, he's not a person
who takes these things seriously?

2131
01:54:24,038 --> 01:54:26,202
Except for cricket he does not
take anything seriously.

2132
01:54:26,616 --> 01:54:28,827
He has no time for love and feelings.

2133
01:54:29,351 --> 01:54:29,953
Oh!

2134
01:54:30,968 --> 01:54:34,095
So, you mean to say
stalking is serious love.

2135
01:54:34,179 --> 01:54:34,765
Of course!

2136
01:54:35,641 --> 01:54:37,812
If I find you stalking me again...

2137
01:54:38,266 --> 01:54:39,570
I'll file a Police complaint.

2138
01:54:39,795 --> 01:54:40,501
I'm warning you.

2139
01:54:40,655 --> 01:54:42,929
File a complaint.
But file a robbery case against me.

2140
01:54:44,131 --> 01:54:44,646
Why?

2141
01:54:45,592 --> 01:54:47,076
Because I stole your heart.

2142
01:54:49,185 --> 01:54:51,569
Oh, God!
Are you always like this?

2143
01:54:52,984 --> 01:54:55,257
Today is an unforgettable day
in my life.

2144
01:54:55,851 --> 01:54:58,578
Go and give this letter
to your brother.

2145
01:54:58,648 --> 01:54:59,648
Go! Get going.

2146
01:55:01,820 --> 01:55:03,499
Please turn around.

2147
01:55:05,187 --> 01:55:06,570
Turn around!

2148
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:09,750
Yes!

2149
01:55:14,188 --> 01:55:16,203
Every ball may or may not
hit the boundary...

2150
01:55:16,289 --> 01:55:18,507
but it's surely heading towards
Giant-11 team's victory.

2151
01:55:18,532 --> 01:55:20,141
In the finals,
for sure Giant-11's team...

2152
01:55:20,274 --> 01:55:22,555
Now come the ball...
Wow, that's a great shot!

2153
01:55:22,587 --> 01:55:24,750
Giant-11 wins by 4 runs.

2154
01:55:24,837 --> 01:55:26,039
Next match is between?

2155
01:55:26,095 --> 01:55:27,469
Blue Star Vs Youth 11

2156
01:55:30,149 --> 01:55:32,015
Let the Ballot be.
Change the opponent team.

2157
01:55:32,063 --> 01:55:33,032
Okay, sir.

2158
01:55:33,259 --> 01:55:35,368
Team Blue Star, can you hear us!

2159
01:55:35,821 --> 01:55:37,969
The upcoming semi-finals match
is between...

2160
01:55:38,063 --> 01:55:40,071
Blue Star Vs 11 Bullets

2161
01:55:40,125 --> 01:55:42,907
Not between Blue Star and Youth 11.

2162
01:55:43,297 --> 01:55:45,320
Why did you change the opponent
for no reason?

2163
01:55:45,374 --> 01:55:46,522
You don't say!

2164
01:55:47,243 --> 01:55:48,586
You should not question us.

2165
01:55:48,922 --> 01:55:49,491
Sir!

2166
01:55:51,993 --> 01:55:53,782
Why did you change the Ballot last minute?

2167
01:55:54,196 --> 01:55:58,680
Last match because you asked
we changed the umpire.

2168
01:55:58,783 --> 01:56:00,118
-We did change right?
-Yes, sir!

2169
01:56:00,515 --> 01:56:01,648
How's it related?

2170
01:56:01,680 --> 01:56:03,821
Your opponent is not
in the position to play.

2171
01:56:04,118 --> 01:56:06,734
Please... Please adjust and play.

2172
01:56:07,525 --> 01:56:09,149
-Are you scared?
-Anna!

2173
01:56:10,227 --> 01:56:11,688
Anna, we'll handle them.

2174
01:56:11,713 --> 01:56:14,910
It's not an easy task to play
against 11 Bullets.

2175
01:56:15,103 --> 01:56:17,040
Anna, no matter who it is
we'll handle them.

2176
01:56:17,408 --> 01:56:19,769
-He's right. We'll handle them.
-Yeah he's right.

2177
01:56:20,438 --> 01:56:21,329
That's not the case.

2178
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:25,641
There's a player Bullet Babu
in 11 Bullets team.

2179
01:56:28,282 --> 01:56:32,235
He has scored 4-5 centuries this year
in different tournaments.

2180
01:56:37,086 --> 01:56:39,470
Everyone expected that he'll play
for the Indian team.

2181
01:56:39,853 --> 01:56:42,806
But he brutally rejected the offer.

2182
01:56:42,962 --> 01:56:43,633
Why did he reject it?

2183
01:56:43,658 --> 01:56:45,446
He only likes the West Indies team.

2184
01:56:45,837 --> 01:56:48,298
He's adamant to play only
for West Indies.

2185
01:56:51,515 --> 01:56:53,828
If we get his wicket we're good.

2186
01:56:54,546 --> 01:56:55,711
But it's not an easy task.

2187
01:56:55,946 --> 01:56:58,749
One - he never got bowled out.

2188
01:56:58,944 --> 01:57:00,905
Two - he never got run out.

2189
01:57:01,742 --> 01:57:03,359
Because he never runs to make runs.

2190
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:04,943
If you bowl leg side
he'll score in off side.

2191
01:57:04,968 --> 01:57:06,594
Likewise if you bowl off side
he'll score in leg side.

2192
01:57:11,251 --> 01:57:14,953
Before you figure which side he plays
the match will be over.

2193
01:57:16,399 --> 01:57:17,534
Spectacular player!

2194
01:57:18,745 --> 01:57:19,809
Spectacular player!

2195
01:57:28,391 --> 01:57:29,087
â™ª Leg Side â™ª

2196
01:57:29,112 --> 01:57:29,735
â™ª Off side â™ª

2197
01:57:29,789 --> 01:57:30,376
â™ª In side â™ª

2198
01:57:30,447 --> 01:57:31,024
â™ª Out side â™ª

2199
01:57:31,079 --> 01:57:32,774
â™ª It's Babu's side â™ª

2200
01:57:33,572 --> 01:57:34,220
â™ª Full Shot â™ª

2201
01:57:34,283 --> 01:57:34,860
â™ª Late cut â™ª

2202
01:57:34,892 --> 01:57:35,490
â™ª Cover Drive â™ª

2203
01:57:35,522 --> 01:57:36,164
â™ª Sweep Shot â™ª

2204
01:57:36,204 --> 01:57:37,524
â™ª It's Babu's shot â™ª

2205
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:41,834
â™ª You never saw the devil haha â™ª

2206
01:57:42,072 --> 01:57:44,600
â™ª My batting is the answer hoho â™ª

2207
01:57:45,132 --> 01:57:47,123
-Look at the guy in the front.
-Hey, Mano!

2208
01:57:48,258 --> 01:57:49,632
-Go!
-Go, go, go!

2209
01:57:50,030 --> 01:57:52,217
Hey, Sam, come on.
Good you came.

2210
01:57:52,482 --> 01:57:54,608
-Ranjith, look he's here.
-I knew he will come.

2211
01:57:55,490 --> 01:57:57,386
-Why are you late?
-How did you come over here?

2212
01:57:57,445 --> 01:57:58,339
-Here you go.
-What is it?

2213
01:57:59,084 --> 01:58:00,815
Whatever I'm here now.
Where are my whites?

2214
01:58:01,982 --> 01:58:06,996
To grace this competition
and to make it sensational...

2215
01:58:07,292 --> 01:58:11,425
popular cricketers
from Madras Chepauk Stadium have arrived.

2216
01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:14,415
To my beloved Ranjith,
this letter is from Anandhi!.

2217
01:58:15,398 --> 01:58:18,014
I'm in tears while writing this letter.

2218
01:58:18,529 --> 01:58:20,005
I don't how to explain.

2219
01:58:20,436 --> 01:58:23,010
My family has fixed engagement for me.

2220
01:58:24,264 --> 01:58:25,881
I definitely won't marry him.

2221
01:58:26,991 --> 01:58:29,227
I feel like meeting you.

2222
01:58:30,514 --> 01:58:32,659
I'll be waiting for you
at the railway station.

2223
01:58:33,943 --> 01:58:34,965
I don't know why....

2224
01:58:35,326 --> 01:58:38,074
I want to meet you once.

2225
01:58:38,569 --> 01:58:39,592
If you could please come and meet me.

2226
01:58:40,060 --> 01:58:42,037
I want to discuss a lot of things with you.

2227
01:58:47,023 --> 01:58:49,124
In all the final matches till date...

2228
01:58:49,281 --> 01:58:51,406
Giant-11 and 11 Bullets
were up against each other.

2229
01:58:51,515 --> 01:58:54,851
Giant-11 team is scared
of 11 Bullets bowling.

2230
01:58:55,295 --> 01:58:57,217
Now you know why winning
against them is tough.

2231
01:58:57,601 --> 01:58:58,937
Their bowling is tough.

2232
01:58:59,211 --> 01:59:01,296
Make sure to get Bullet Babu's wicket.

2233
01:59:01,617 --> 01:59:02,929
Somehow get his wicket.

2234
01:59:03,193 --> 01:59:04,693
Understood? Go ahead!

2235
01:59:05,901 --> 01:59:07,489
All the best! Play well.

2236
01:59:10,663 --> 01:59:13,902
11 Bullets team has arrived
on the field.

2237
01:59:14,287 --> 01:59:18,194
The reason for excitement
is Bullet Babu.

2238
01:59:20,212 --> 01:59:21,811
Hey, are you okay?

2239
01:59:21,927 --> 01:59:23,936
Venkatesh and Babu
are opening for Blue Star...

2240
01:59:24,076 --> 01:59:27,584
Bullet Suman is going to bowl
the first over.

2241
01:59:27,726 --> 01:59:28,936
First ball...

2242
01:59:29,585 --> 01:59:31,155
-Hey!
-Bouncer!

2243
01:59:31,592 --> 01:59:32,811
Fantastic bowling.

2244
01:59:32,882 --> 01:59:34,217
-Damn it!
-In two overs, we'll be done.

2245
01:59:34,248 --> 01:59:37,727
Suman's bowling is like Ambrose's delivery.

2246
01:59:37,835 --> 01:59:39,655
Next ball is to Venkatesh!

2247
01:59:39,803 --> 01:59:40,647
Can he face it?

2248
01:59:40,694 --> 01:59:42,037
-Catch it!-In the air!

2249
01:59:42,491 --> 01:59:43,576
High up in the air.

2250
01:59:43,881 --> 01:59:45,545
-Come on, boys!
-Wow, that's a very good catch.

2251
01:59:46,654 --> 01:59:50,450
In the first over, there were no runs,
and lost a wicket...

2252
01:59:50,582 --> 01:59:51,533
...team Blue Star!

2253
01:59:51,557 --> 01:59:54,895
The next batsman is captain, Ranjith.

2254
01:59:55,230 --> 01:59:57,319
Ranjith, play well.

2255
01:59:57,352 --> 01:59:58,637
He's facing his first ball.

2256
01:59:59,256 --> 02:00:00,670
-Good ball! Good ball!
-Bouncer!

2257
02:00:00,903 --> 02:00:02,208
Another bouncer!

2258
02:00:02,555 --> 02:00:04,059
Suman's bowling...

2259
02:00:04,266 --> 02:00:05,599
is dangerous.

2260
02:00:05,624 --> 02:00:06,480
Stay and play.

2261
02:00:07,991 --> 02:00:09,331
Another bouncer!

2262
02:00:09,474 --> 02:00:12,673
Before he could lift the bat,
the ball went to the keeper.

2263
02:00:13,147 --> 02:00:14,045
Super, Suman!

2264
02:00:14,108 --> 02:00:15,671
Maari is going to bowl next.

2265
02:00:16,146 --> 02:00:17,146
Maari's bowling...

2266
02:00:17,405 --> 02:00:18,998
Wow, that's a four!

2267
02:00:19,093 --> 02:00:20,631
Hey, that's fantastic!

2268
02:00:28,436 --> 02:00:30,068
A catch on the leg side.

2269
02:00:30,436 --> 02:00:33,849
Another catch,
and Blue Star loses another wicket.

2270
02:00:37,126 --> 02:00:38,444
Blue Star is at 5 runs...

2271
02:00:38,523 --> 02:00:41,053
in 2 overs and 2 wickets down.

2272
02:00:41,154 --> 02:00:42,919
You can't play in all the matches.

2273
02:00:43,083 --> 02:00:44,512
That's how the game is.
Let it go!

2274
02:00:44,584 --> 02:00:47,263
-Let's wait and watch.
-Is everything okay?

2275
02:00:47,350 --> 02:00:48,428
Bala's next ball...

2276
02:00:51,069 --> 02:00:52,927
Third down, Sam!

2277
02:00:55,070 --> 02:00:57,052
-Lovely bowling.
-Super!

2278
02:00:58,220 --> 02:00:59,852
A meticulous defense.

2279
02:01:02,115 --> 02:01:04,161
Sam instead hitting runs
you're playing stroke.

2280
02:01:04,397 --> 02:01:06,779
Didn't you guys asked me not to
hit all the balls?

2281
02:01:06,927 --> 02:01:07,959
That's why I'm playing defense.

2282
02:01:08,185 --> 02:01:08,677
Go ahead!

2283
02:01:08,724 --> 02:01:10,972
Next ball...
Caught behind!

2284
02:01:11,005 --> 02:01:13,159
Blue Star lost Ammukutty's wicket.

2285
02:01:13,231 --> 02:01:14,620
Super! Good job!

2286
02:01:14,677 --> 02:01:15,634
Next down is Rajesh.

2287
02:01:15,659 --> 02:01:17,486
Keep it in control.
Don't let them score.

2288
02:01:18,524 --> 02:01:19,415
Next ball...

2289
02:01:19,484 --> 02:01:22,141
-That's a super ball.
-Good bowling.

2290
02:01:22,455 --> 02:01:23,712
Hey, what happened to you?

2291
02:01:23,775 --> 02:01:25,337
He's not a player who plays defense.

2292
02:01:26,157 --> 02:01:27,148
Hey, Ranjith,
ask him to start hitting runs.

2293
02:01:27,173 --> 02:01:28,117
Anna, ask him to play.

2294
02:01:28,946 --> 02:01:30,648
Hey, we're running out of overs.

2295
02:01:30,875 --> 02:01:32,101
If you continue this form
we can't make it.

2296
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:34,118
If I tell him he won't listen to me.

2297
02:01:34,407 --> 02:01:35,540
Just tell him this.

2298
02:01:38,594 --> 02:01:40,634
-Do you want water?
-I don't want it.

2299
02:01:41,735 --> 02:01:44,634
-Hey, bowl!
-Hey, Sam, start hitting.

2300
02:01:44,845 --> 02:01:46,305
What the hell is wrong with you?

2301
02:01:46,430 --> 02:01:47,422
Start hitting!

2302
02:01:47,664 --> 02:01:50,087
Sam, you keep playing defense.

2303
02:01:50,422 --> 02:01:51,687
You don't have to score.

2304
02:01:52,124 --> 02:01:54,405
He's bowling really fast.
You may get hurt.

2305
02:01:54,579 --> 02:01:55,954
Take care and play patiently.

2306
02:01:55,994 --> 02:01:57,653
Start hitting dude!

2307
02:02:03,264 --> 02:02:05,442
That's a sixer!

2308
02:02:05,988 --> 02:02:07,003
Fantastic shot!

2309
02:02:07,141 --> 02:02:09,242
-Did you see that?
-Come on!

2310
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:12,040
There goes four runs.

2311
02:02:12,070 --> 02:02:13,240
Super! Super!

2312
02:02:30,972 --> 02:02:31,901
Come on! Come on!

2313
02:02:40,402 --> 02:02:41,572
Parthi, be cool and bowl.

2314
02:02:41,597 --> 02:02:42,615
-Bullet is advising the bowler.
-Come on!

2315
02:02:42,671 --> 02:02:44,272
Let's wait and watch.

2316
02:02:44,782 --> 02:02:46,968
Oh! Inside edge bowled out.

2317
02:02:47,328 --> 02:02:50,527
Sam's game dwindled in Mani's bowling.

2318
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:55,246
Current, caught out!

2319
02:02:55,366 --> 02:02:56,053
Bowled!

2320
02:02:57,696 --> 02:03:00,441
Just stay and play.
You don't have to score.

2321
02:03:00,788 --> 02:03:02,605
Blue Star's game is slipping away.

2322
02:03:02,977 --> 02:03:04,743
There it ends, Blue Star.

2323
02:03:07,027 --> 02:03:08,746
98 is the score.

2324
02:03:09,082 --> 02:03:11,488
98 is an easy target for 11-Bullets.

2325
02:03:11,675 --> 02:03:14,285
-Th opening batsmen will finish the match.
-What happened?

2326
02:03:14,489 --> 02:03:15,432
It's not like the match has ended.

2327
02:03:15,889 --> 02:03:17,631
We can't easily win all the matches.

2328
02:03:18,457 --> 02:03:20,334
Boys, don't lose hope.
Let's try.

2329
02:03:20,751 --> 02:03:21,274
Come on!

2330
02:03:21,298 --> 02:03:23,602
Even if we lose, it's okay.
Let's go!

2331
02:03:24,545 --> 02:03:25,780
-Come on!
-Come on, boys!

2332
02:03:25,819 --> 02:03:27,599
Come on.
Let's get to the game.

2333
02:03:27,718 --> 02:03:30,251
11 Bullets team batsmen are coming in.

2334
02:03:30,406 --> 02:03:33,233
First over is bowled by Rajesh.

2335
02:03:36,597 --> 02:03:39,071
-First ball is a sixer on the leg side.
-Catch it! Damn!

2336
02:03:44,318 --> 02:03:45,084
Catch it!

2337
02:03:45,140 --> 02:03:46,089
Oh, no!

2338
02:03:46,342 --> 02:03:47,716
Shall we give Sam an over.

2339
02:03:49,740 --> 02:03:50,544
Hey, Ranjith!

2340
02:03:52,193 --> 02:03:54,287
Put your head in the game.
It's semi-finals.

2341
02:03:54,920 --> 02:03:57,052
Hey, sorry. We'll get it in line.

2342
02:03:57,421 --> 02:03:59,522
Come on, boys! Come on!

2343
02:03:59,731 --> 02:04:02,121
Sam, come on bowl.

2344
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:03,868
Sam is about to bowl.

2345
02:04:05,482 --> 02:04:06,584
Catch! Catch! Catch!

2346
02:04:06,866 --> 02:04:08,178
Caught and bowled by Sam!

2347
02:04:08,257 --> 02:04:10,686
11-Bullets have lost 3 wickets.

2348
02:04:10,761 --> 02:04:14,532
For your information,
the match is about to begin only now.

2349
02:04:14,724 --> 02:04:16,029
Star player!

2350
02:04:16,326 --> 02:04:18,014
With crackling fanfare!

2351
02:04:18,551 --> 02:04:21,902
Now arrives Bullet Babu.

2352
02:04:35,924 --> 02:04:38,423
Bullet Babu! Bullet Babu!

2353
02:04:42,089 --> 02:04:43,399
Hey, Qasim, you move behind.

2354
02:04:43,501 --> 02:04:44,588
Hey, you sit down here.

2355
02:04:44,886 --> 02:04:46,753
Machi, take down this wicket.

2356
02:05:00,300 --> 02:05:01,432
Amazing shot!

2357
02:05:01,908 --> 02:05:03,502
The ball flew high in the air.

2358
02:05:05,283 --> 02:05:07,386
A ball from Thiruteni's corner
returns to the corner.

2359
02:05:11,275 --> 02:05:11,860
â™ª Leg Side â™ª

2360
02:05:11,908 --> 02:05:12,399
â™ª Off side â™ª

2361
02:05:12,478 --> 02:05:13,017
â™ª In side â™ª

2362
02:05:13,042 --> 02:05:13,642
â™ª Out side â™ª

2363
02:05:13,687 --> 02:05:15,422
â™ª It's Babu's side â™ª

2364
02:05:16,806 --> 02:05:17,275
â™ª Full Shot â™ª

2365
02:05:17,306 --> 02:05:17,884
â™ª Late cut â™ª

2366
02:05:17,916 --> 02:05:18,540
â™ª Cover Drive â™ª

2367
02:05:18,588 --> 02:05:19,189
â™ª Sweep Shot â™ª

2368
02:05:19,252 --> 02:05:20,368
â™ª It's Babu's shot â™ª

2369
02:05:22,447 --> 02:05:24,733
â™ª You never saw the devil â™ª

2370
02:05:25,111 --> 02:05:27,053
â™ª My batting is the answer â™ª

2371
02:05:27,858 --> 02:05:30,069
â™ª You never saw the devil â™ª

2372
02:05:30,280 --> 02:05:32,577
â™ª My batting is the answer, baby â™ª

2373
02:05:47,954 --> 02:05:49,195
-Next ball!
-Catch it!

2374
02:05:49,351 --> 02:05:51,109
-Fantastic bowling!
-They dropped the catch.

2375
02:05:51,219 --> 02:05:52,716
-Dropped the catch.
-That's my catch.

2376
02:05:53,417 --> 02:05:54,615
Don't you have any sense?
It was coming toward me.

2377
02:05:56,296 --> 02:05:59,141
Another ball. And it's a sixer!

2378
02:05:59,166 --> 02:06:00,055
Bring me some water.

2379
02:06:00,985 --> 02:06:02,719
Someone, please get the ball.

2380
02:06:03,279 --> 02:06:04,740
How many are we going to lose?

2381
02:06:05,743 --> 02:06:06,984
-Anna!
-What is it?

2382
02:06:07,189 --> 02:06:08,845
Why do you not want to play
for Indian team?

2383
02:06:09,714 --> 02:06:11,049
It's because it's Indian team.

2384
02:06:11,354 --> 02:06:12,838
Anyway they won't take me in.

2385
02:06:13,058 --> 02:06:14,792
It's best not to get humiliated.

2386
02:06:15,284 --> 02:06:17,119
Why do you like to play for West Indies?

2387
02:06:17,674 --> 02:06:18,798
That's my country!

2388
02:06:20,064 --> 02:06:21,095
You call our players, players?

2389
02:06:21,518 --> 02:06:23,518
They mix too much politics in sports.

2390
02:06:24,159 --> 02:06:25,198
Bloody beggars!

2391
02:06:27,705 --> 02:06:28,931
I'm waiting for my Visa.

2392
02:06:29,353 --> 02:06:31,533
Soon, Lara and I...

2393
02:06:32,283 --> 02:06:33,408
will be opening batsmen.

2394
02:06:33,744 --> 02:06:35,720
That sounds amazing, Anna.

2395
02:06:40,587 --> 02:06:41,722
Over there! Over there!

2396
02:06:44,017 --> 02:06:47,548
Run out! Murugan returned
to the pavilion in no time.

2397
02:06:47,999 --> 02:06:49,735
The last run cost them...

2398
02:06:50,087 --> 02:06:51,768
-Come on, Bharath!
-Hey, Venkat, come here.

2399
02:06:52,222 --> 02:06:53,752
We're in team discussion.
Wait for a bit.

2400
02:06:54,017 --> 02:06:55,118
They're overdoing it.

2401
02:06:55,142 --> 02:06:57,001
They keep switching between them.

2402
02:07:08,799 --> 02:07:12,134
-Catch it.-Wicket keeper Ranjith missed the catch.

2403
02:07:12,454 --> 02:07:14,165
They missed a great opportunity.

2404
02:07:15,017 --> 02:07:16,580
-Don't you know how to catch?
-Hey!

2405
02:07:16,635 --> 02:07:17,463
It came directly to your hand.

2406
02:07:17,579 --> 02:07:19,008
-Get moving!
-I'm sorry!

2407
02:07:19,086 --> 02:07:21,227
Come on, keep it up.

2408
02:07:21,308 --> 02:07:23,407
-Damn!
-Hey, what happened?

2409
02:07:24,033 --> 02:07:24,962
I'll tell you later.

2410
02:07:25,141 --> 02:07:26,993
Ranjith, it's okay.

2411
02:07:27,080 --> 02:07:28,954
Rajesh, keep it out.

2412
02:07:29,119 --> 02:07:31,142
Ranjith switch the over to Rajesh.

2413
02:07:31,462 --> 02:07:33,836
Will this make any difference?

2414
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:36,079
Bullet Babu is getting ready to bat.

2415
02:07:42,142 --> 02:07:43,900
Howzzzat! Howzzzat!

2416
02:07:43,971 --> 02:07:44,915
Fantastic catch!

2417
02:07:45,056 --> 02:07:46,775
Hey, that's amazing.

2418
02:07:46,860 --> 02:07:48,923
Sir, it's clean out.
You're being unfair.

2419
02:07:49,032 --> 02:07:50,704
Sir, I could hear the nick sound.

2420
02:07:53,650 --> 02:07:54,892
Umpire declared it not out.

2421
02:07:54,946 --> 02:07:56,438
-Hey!
-How come it's not out?

2422
02:07:56,535 --> 02:07:57,978
Sir, it's out!

2423
02:07:58,110 --> 02:07:59,704
Sir, umpire, sir. It's clean tip.

2424
02:07:59,775 --> 02:08:02,242
Blue Star don't argue with the umpire.

2425
02:08:03,196 --> 02:08:05,680
Bullet Babu agreed it's out.

2426
02:08:05,915 --> 02:08:08,334
He agreed, nicked the bat,
and walked out.

2427
02:08:08,486 --> 02:08:10,431
This is true sportsman spirit.

2428
02:08:10,509 --> 02:08:13,775
This modesty is what makes
a great sportsperson.

2429
02:08:17,829 --> 02:08:19,367
Bullet Babu is out.
No point in watching the match.

2430
02:08:19,405 --> 02:08:21,281
Come on, let's go.

2431
02:08:21,859 --> 02:08:24,126
This is true sportsman spirit.

2432
02:08:32,439 --> 02:08:34,439
Fantastic fielding, Ammukutty.

2433
02:08:34,664 --> 02:08:36,134
-Howzzat!
-That's a run out!

2434
02:08:37,352 --> 02:08:38,352
That was handed to them.

2435
02:08:46,085 --> 02:08:48,562
They need 7 runs in 5 balls.

2436
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:50,640
Ranjith is making some changes
in the fielding.

2437
02:08:50,774 --> 02:08:52,586
This is a crucial time.

2438
02:08:52,915 --> 02:08:54,234
Here comes the next ball.

2439
02:08:54,524 --> 02:08:55,555
Saran hit the ball!

2440
02:08:55,782 --> 02:08:58,173
96 runs with 9 wickets down...

2441
02:08:58,298 --> 02:09:02,626
11-Bullets need 3 runs from 4 balls.

2442
02:09:03,243 --> 02:09:04,859
Will they hit a 4 to finish the match?

2443
02:09:05,144 --> 02:09:08,048
Or will Blue Star get lucky?

2444
02:09:08,248 --> 02:09:10,118
3 runs in 4 balls!

2445
02:09:10,313 --> 02:09:12,313
As it's the last wicket...

2446
02:09:12,415 --> 02:09:14,915
the semi-finals is coming to an end.

2447
02:09:15,063 --> 02:09:17,742
It will decide who will be
entering the finals.

2448
02:09:18,314 --> 02:09:20,001
Will Blue Star win the match?

2449
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:20,845
There goes the ball!

2450
02:09:22,119 --> 02:09:23,892
-Strike!
-Catch! Catch!

2451
02:09:23,930 --> 02:09:25,087
It's mine. Leave it!

2452
02:09:25,235 --> 02:09:25,828
Catch!

2453
02:09:34,705 --> 02:09:35,798
I ended it, Ranjith!

2454
02:09:35,882 --> 02:09:37,748
It's a historic moment.

2455
02:09:37,903 --> 02:09:40,147
For the first time, Team 11-Bullets

2456
02:09:40,238 --> 02:09:43,709
have lost the semi-finals
and did not make it to the finals.

2457
02:09:47,821 --> 02:09:49,193
Super! Super!

2458
02:09:50,743 --> 02:09:52,007
You guys are amazing players!

2459
02:09:53,561 --> 02:09:55,594
But you don't have unity.

2460
02:09:55,774 --> 02:09:56,858
If you continue to bicker...

2461
02:09:56,883 --> 02:09:58,778
anyone can destroy your team.

2462
02:10:00,180 --> 02:10:01,656
Everyone unite and play.

2463
02:10:01,869 --> 02:10:02,900
Only then you can win.

2464
02:10:02,953 --> 02:10:03,874
Okay! Okay!

2465
02:10:03,983 --> 02:10:06,124
Well done. At least in the
next match play united.

2466
02:10:06,258 --> 02:10:08,829
-You guys should win the trophy.
-Come on, let's go!

2467
02:10:30,336 --> 02:10:31,077
Hey, Ranjith!

2468
02:10:32,124 --> 02:10:33,842
We have a match tomorrow.
And you're here!

2469
02:10:34,194 --> 02:10:34,927
What happened?

2470
02:10:35,467 --> 02:10:38,061
Hey, why do you look upset?

2471
02:10:38,358 --> 02:10:39,748
I feel like meeting her one last time.

2472
02:10:40,365 --> 02:10:40,935
Shall we?

2473
02:10:42,460 --> 02:10:43,116
Let it go!

2474
02:10:43,741 --> 02:10:45,334
You said today's her engagement.

2475
02:10:46,039 --> 02:10:47,281
I don't think going there
is a good idea.

2476
02:10:47,633 --> 02:10:48,859
It will call for unnecessary problems.

2477
02:10:48,975 --> 02:10:50,350
Everything went wrong.

2478
02:10:51,646 --> 02:10:54,747
That girl did profess her love to you.

2479
02:10:55,241 --> 02:10:56,193
Then why did she do it?

2480
02:10:56,273 --> 02:10:57,780
Women can't be trusted.

2481
02:10:58,415 --> 02:10:59,248
That's not the case!

2482
02:11:01,648 --> 02:11:03,734
We never expressed our love
to each other.

2483
02:11:04,522 --> 02:11:06,656
I don't even know what is she
going through.

2484
02:11:09,921 --> 02:11:12,577
But I can't agree to the fact that she's
getting engaged to someone else.

2485
02:11:13,897 --> 02:11:15,709
If I just meet her once...

2486
02:11:16,555 --> 02:11:17,599
I will be happy.

2487
02:11:23,092 --> 02:11:24,118
She's my dream!

2488
02:11:26,085 --> 02:11:27,842
Hey! Hey! Ranjith!

2489
02:11:28,733 --> 02:11:30,336
You're crying like a small kid.

2490
02:11:30,944 --> 02:11:32,211
First time love failure?

2491
02:11:38,889 --> 02:11:41,984
Fine, you want to meet her.

2492
02:11:42,601 --> 02:11:43,397
Come on, let's go!

2493
02:11:45,343 --> 02:11:46,240
Come on. Get up!

2494
02:11:58,975 --> 02:11:59,975
Anna, give me a cigarette.

2495
02:12:02,218 --> 02:12:03,368
Hey, I'm going to take a leak.

2496
02:12:03,483 --> 02:12:04,233
Anna, two teas.

2497
02:12:05,388 --> 02:12:06,914
Please stand on the other side.

2498
02:12:07,943 --> 02:12:08,966
Can't you see I'm cutting onions?

2499
02:12:19,469 --> 02:12:25,313
â™ª I am walking on an unknown path â™ª

2500
02:12:25,798 --> 02:12:31,712
â™ª For I do not have a company,
I talk to my own shadow â™ª

2501
02:12:32,189 --> 02:12:37,814
â™ª Longing to see your face â™ª

2502
02:12:38,626 --> 02:12:44,329
â™ª Listening to your voice
in the breeze â™ª

2503
02:12:45,352 --> 02:12:49,852
â™ª Hey! The cloud
that pushes the train â™ª

2504
02:12:50,165 --> 02:12:53,110
â™ª The crow
that cuddles the rain â™ª

2505
02:12:53,424 --> 02:12:58,048
â™ª The love monster
that pinches the soul â™ª

2506
02:12:58,244 --> 02:13:02,790
â™ª Why am I Going in search of her? â™ª

2507
02:13:03,088 --> 02:13:05,923
â™ª Getting tortured by worry? â™ª

2508
02:13:06,321 --> 02:13:11,025
â™ª Dreaming and becoming a mirage? â™ª

2509
02:13:11,702 --> 02:13:12,860
Just because we let you walk.

2510
02:13:12,913 --> 02:13:13,829
You stepped into our area.

2511
02:13:13,915 --> 02:13:16,382
-Hey, hit him.
-Come on, hit him!

2512
02:13:16,515 --> 02:13:18,499
Don't spare him. Hit him!

2513
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:20,460
Hey, don't spare him!

2514
02:13:20,702 --> 02:13:22,413
Hey, who the hell are you guys?

2515
02:13:22,460 --> 02:13:24,874
Hey! Hey, who are you guys?

2516
02:13:25,195 --> 02:13:26,436
Hey, break it off!

2517
02:13:26,523 --> 02:13:28,327
Hey! Hey, break it off!

2518
02:13:28,445 --> 02:13:31,124
Who the hell are you guys?
I'll kill you all!

2519
02:13:31,334 --> 02:13:33,467
-Why do you support him?
-He's my friend!

2520
02:13:33,996 --> 02:13:34,952
To hell with your friendship.

2521
02:13:35,014 --> 02:13:36,417
Would you stay calm if someone
pursued your sister?

2522
02:13:36,452 --> 02:13:37,510
Or would you invite him for dinner?

2523
02:13:37,663 --> 02:13:39,038
You'd know if it's your sister.

2524
02:13:39,101 --> 02:13:40,429
If I see you guys again in this area...

2525
02:13:40,515 --> 02:13:41,710
I will be your worst nightmare.

2526
02:13:43,266 --> 02:13:43,978
Hey let's go!

2527
02:13:44,682 --> 02:13:47,330
â™ª We are like two poles â™ª

2528
02:13:47,923 --> 02:13:50,844
â™ª On the two sides of the sky â™ª

2529
02:13:51,088 --> 02:13:56,121
â™ª My truth is looking
for your shadow â™ª

2530
02:13:56,766 --> 02:13:59,672
â™ª When the horizon becomes colorful â™ª

2531
02:13:59,697 --> 02:14:02,813
â™ª After the train leaves its place â™ª

2532
02:14:03,010 --> 02:14:09,347
â™ª I am going to sleep alone
in the evening â™ª

2533
02:14:09,565 --> 02:14:15,570
â™ª I followed her into
an unknown path â™ª

2534
02:14:15,883 --> 02:14:22,282
â™ª Now I'm hurting in solitude â™ª

2535
02:14:22,744 --> 02:14:27,140
â™ª Hey The cloud
that pushes the train â™ª

2536
02:14:27,513 --> 02:14:30,348
â™ª The crow
that cuddles the rain â™ª

2537
02:14:30,707 --> 02:14:35,340
â™ª The love monster
that pinches the soul â™ª

2538
02:14:35,534 --> 02:14:39,956
â™ª Why am I Going in search of her? â™ª

2539
02:14:40,187 --> 02:14:43,222
â™ª Getting tortured by worry? â™ª

2540
02:14:43,544 --> 02:14:48,213
â™ª Dreaming and becoming a mirage? â™ª

2541
02:14:48,362 --> 02:14:52,816
â™ª Hey The cloud
that pushes the train â™ª

2542
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:56,035
â™ª The crow
that cuddles the rain â™ª

2543
02:14:56,269 --> 02:15:00,948
â™ª The love monster
that pinches the soul â™ª

2544
02:15:14,171 --> 02:15:15,605
Would you stay calm if someone
pursued your sister?

2545
02:15:15,672 --> 02:15:16,619
Or would you invite him for dinner?

2546
02:15:28,967 --> 02:15:29,928
What is happening?

2547
02:15:32,046 --> 02:15:33,905
-Anna, what are you doing?
-Dig in!

2548
02:15:34,225 --> 02:15:35,357
Hey, soon begin work.

2549
02:15:35,389 --> 02:15:36,826
Gopal, what's happening?

2550
02:15:37,654 --> 02:15:41,294
You're well aware who owns this land.

2551
02:15:41,614 --> 02:15:43,496
-Sir has bought this land.
-Why?

2552
02:15:43,647 --> 02:15:44,701
He's going to build a petrol bunk.

2553
02:15:44,874 --> 02:15:46,092
As per the astrologer...

2554
02:15:46,349 --> 02:15:47,995
we need to start the foundation work.

2555
02:15:48,223 --> 02:15:49,777
We have to begin work from today.

2556
02:15:50,256 --> 02:15:51,826
You people don't waste our time...

2557
02:15:52,380 --> 02:15:54,075
and please leave the ground.

2558
02:15:54,138 --> 02:15:57,067
Gopal, you know this is the only ground
our boys have to play cricket.

2559
02:15:57,459 --> 02:15:59,256
That's why I let them play till now.

2560
02:15:59,334 --> 02:16:01,935
Our boys have made it to Finals
in MCF tournament.

2561
02:16:01,991 --> 02:16:02,467
So?

2562
02:16:02,561 --> 02:16:05,076
How could you do this
during their practice sessions?

2563
02:16:05,296 --> 02:16:06,662
Anna, what's this?

2564
02:16:06,764 --> 02:16:08,686
-This is our ground.
-How's it your ground?

2565
02:16:10,014 --> 02:16:12,459
It's because of me he did not interfere
in this matter.

2566
02:16:12,576 --> 02:16:14,155
-Where do we play?
-I don't care!

2567
02:16:14,310 --> 02:16:16,240
Go and play in the forest
or somewhere else.

2568
02:16:16,319 --> 02:16:18,521
We can't go over there.
We will play over here.

2569
02:16:18,788 --> 02:16:19,600
This is our ground!

2570
02:16:19,810 --> 02:16:21,732
Hey, arrogance is it?

2571
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:24,190
Do you realize who you're talking to?

2572
02:16:24,287 --> 02:16:27,474
Anna, give respect and take respect.

2573
02:16:27,710 --> 02:16:28,217
Hey!

2574
02:16:28,354 --> 02:16:29,955
-Hey!
-Hey, how dare you?

2575
02:16:30,154 --> 02:16:31,990
-Hey, Ranjith, calm down.
-Gopal...

2576
02:16:32,389 --> 02:16:35,303
I was going to take my time
to start work.

2577
02:16:36,981 --> 02:16:40,991
Tonight I'm sending bulldozer
to clean the ground.

2578
02:16:41,123 --> 02:16:43,045
I challenge you!

2579
02:16:43,319 --> 02:16:45,170
Do you think we'll sit ducks
and watch it happen?

2580
02:16:45,419 --> 02:16:46,927
Times have changed. Scram!

2581
02:16:47,014 --> 02:16:48,834
-Hey, Sam!
-What the hell?

2582
02:16:49,584 --> 02:16:51,434
Gopal, let's not do it today.

2583
02:16:51,600 --> 02:16:52,756
It's not a good day.

2584
02:16:52,833 --> 02:16:55,466
I'll consult with the astrologer
and pick a different date.

2585
02:16:56,184 --> 02:16:58,370
Come on! Don't get angry, Gopal.

2586
02:16:58,778 --> 02:17:00,160
I thought it will be smooth.

2587
02:17:00,242 --> 02:17:02,046
But looks like there are
too many conflicts.

2588
02:17:03,224 --> 02:17:05,160
Fine, when they return
we'll handle them.

2589
02:17:05,350 --> 02:17:07,662
Huh! Come on, let's practice.

2590
02:17:10,020 --> 02:17:10,550
Anna!

2591
02:17:12,817 --> 02:17:14,746
Ask them why they were silent?

2592
02:17:17,398 --> 02:17:19,116
Hey, what is it?

2593
02:17:19,701 --> 02:17:21,349
Is it okay, if you don't have
a place to practice?

2594
02:17:22,006 --> 02:17:23,162
You guys were silent throughout.

2595
02:17:23,622 --> 02:17:25,545
No matter who it is.
Learn to speak with respect.

2596
02:17:25,663 --> 02:17:27,014
I know who and when to respect.

2597
02:17:27,107 --> 02:17:28,763
-What?-He's incorrigible.

2598
02:17:32,333 --> 02:17:33,301
To hell with you!

2599
02:17:33,707 --> 02:17:34,933
You guys don't deserve cricket.

2600
02:17:35,295 --> 02:17:37,373
I thought playing together
will unite us.

2601
02:17:37,747 --> 02:17:39,552
But your heads are filled with nonsense.

2602
02:17:39,676 --> 02:17:42,996
Anna, we deserve this and more
for playing with them.

2603
02:17:44,804 --> 02:17:45,905
What do you mean by "them?"

2604
02:17:48,310 --> 02:17:49,349
Answer me?

2605
02:17:51,600 --> 02:17:53,444
Where does this hate come from?

2606
02:17:54,201 --> 02:17:54,865
Hey...

2607
02:17:56,389 --> 02:17:58,912
Both the teams playing together
itself a victory.

2608
02:18:00,038 --> 02:18:02,839
But you proved me wrong
that it's not possible.

2609
02:18:03,107 --> 02:18:03,670
Get lost!

2610
02:18:03,849 --> 02:18:06,535
Hey, listen closely to what
I have to say.

2611
02:18:08,514 --> 02:18:10,193
Hate will lead you to destruction.

2612
02:18:11,051 --> 02:18:12,489
But patience will teach you volumes.

2613
02:18:16,099 --> 02:18:17,669
Once I returned from the hospital...

2614
02:18:19,076 --> 02:18:22,092
I picked up a knife
and went to kill Mani.

2615
02:18:28,686 --> 02:18:30,061
I stopped and thought for a moment.

2616
02:18:31,387 --> 02:18:32,740
If I kill Mani...

2617
02:18:33,952 --> 02:18:35,373
his family will suffer.

2618
02:18:37,371 --> 02:18:39,153
That moment of patience saved his life.

2619
02:18:41,624 --> 02:18:43,399
If I had killed him and went to prison...

2620
02:18:44,139 --> 02:18:45,747
People from both factions would've
fought and killed each other.

2621
02:18:46,733 --> 02:18:47,790
It would've stirred a riot.

2622
02:18:47,983 --> 02:18:49,850
I would've been a different example
to you guys.

2623
02:18:50,632 --> 02:18:54,256
I believed sports will bring us together.

2624
02:18:56,701 --> 02:18:58,772
I believe as we played
eventually things will get better.

2625
02:19:05,467 --> 02:19:06,154
I don't know.

2626
02:19:07,147 --> 02:19:08,373
I don't know what to do.

2627
02:19:13,912 --> 02:19:15,700
Remain like this
and eventually die in the end.

2628
02:19:23,295 --> 02:19:24,826
Did you notice their arrogance?

2629
02:19:24,989 --> 02:19:26,598
They were raising their voice to me.

2630
02:19:26,778 --> 02:19:27,989
You guys are to be blamed.

2631
02:19:28,193 --> 02:19:30,115
They stood as equal to us!

2632
02:19:31,007 --> 02:19:31,990
There's nothing left to say.

2633
02:19:32,186 --> 02:19:33,686
My own blood is not with me.

2634
02:19:33,967 --> 02:19:35,826
It's all because of him.

2635
02:19:36,201 --> 02:19:37,498
Listen closely, Rajesh...

2636
02:19:39,295 --> 02:19:41,826
I will arrange a ground
for you boys to play.

2637
02:19:43,380 --> 02:19:45,731
If you still go and play with them...

2638
02:19:49,631 --> 02:19:52,155
It's equal to have slippered me.

2639
02:19:54,196 --> 02:19:54,990
Understood?

2640
02:19:56,881 --> 02:19:59,694
Hey, how dare you raise your hand on me?

2641
02:20:00,077 --> 02:20:01,131
-Bloody rascals!
-Mani Anna!

2642
02:20:02,232 --> 02:20:04,177
-Nothing!
-Come on. Let's go home.

2643
02:20:04,334 --> 02:20:05,919
The place I work...

2644
02:20:06,514 --> 02:20:09,490
were praising that you boys
are playing amazing cricket.

2645
02:20:09,545 --> 02:20:10,545
You're right. Let's go!

2646
02:20:10,613 --> 02:20:12,717
You know how happy I am.

2647
02:20:12,928 --> 02:20:15,083
They say it's a huge tournament.

2648
02:20:15,553 --> 02:20:17,216
That's right. We are playing.

2649
02:20:17,451 --> 02:20:18,732
Play well my boys.

2650
02:20:20,795 --> 02:20:21,951
Play united!

2651
02:20:22,123 --> 02:20:24,959
-Sure we will.
-United play is good.

2652
02:20:25,397 --> 02:20:27,224
Everyone play together.

2653
02:20:28,887 --> 02:20:32,239
But you should not
fight with each other.

2654
02:20:32,271 --> 02:20:33,497
-Okay?
-We won't fight.

2655
02:20:34,366 --> 02:20:35,365
Go home safe.

2656
02:20:35,608 --> 02:20:37,944
Learn from my life.

2657
02:20:38,389 --> 02:20:39,545
Go home and sleep.

2658
02:20:39,655 --> 02:20:41,045
You guys are students.

2659
02:20:41,466 --> 02:20:43,122
-Be good...
-Watch out!

2660
02:20:43,217 --> 02:20:46,146
Had I been educated
I would've lead a good life.

2661
02:20:46,389 --> 02:20:49,549
They hollow praised
and turned me into a mess.

2662
02:21:01,534 --> 02:21:04,893
In this 6th year
of MCF cricket tournament...

2663
02:21:04,978 --> 02:21:08,815
Youth 11 scored 120 in semi-finals.

2664
02:21:09,198 --> 02:21:11,159
There goes a sixer.

2665
02:21:11,246 --> 02:21:14,620
Giant-11 won the match
and have entered the finals.

2666
02:21:14,699 --> 02:21:16,292
The buzz is they will win
the trophy this year.

2667
02:21:17,542 --> 02:21:18,979
Super! Maintain the bowling.

2668
02:21:19,020 --> 02:21:20,675
Well bowled.
Maintain the bowling.

2669
02:21:21,814 --> 02:21:23,338
-Hey, you play.
-Come on, bowl.

2670
02:21:24,354 --> 02:21:26,345
-You play. I'm not feeling good.
-What happened?

2671
02:21:27,886 --> 02:21:30,222
Had we spoken amicably,
it would've not been worse.

2672
02:21:30,487 --> 02:21:32,073
Hey, it's okay if they don't want to come.

2673
02:21:32,917 --> 02:21:34,120
His Mama behaves as if he's a big shot.

2674
02:21:52,686 --> 02:21:54,131
Why is he coming over here?

2675
02:21:55,052 --> 02:21:57,458
Don't you remember
he disrespected your Mama?

2676
02:22:01,303 --> 02:22:03,107
Shall we go? It's the finals.

2677
02:22:03,607 --> 02:22:05,748
Hey, Current, it's not possible.

2678
02:22:06,591 --> 02:22:08,490
-Shut up!
-It's all because of you.

2679
02:22:09,053 --> 02:22:10,365
If anyone dares to go,
that's it!

2680
02:22:10,568 --> 02:22:13,153
To play on this ground
they need to be qualified.

2681
02:22:13,373 --> 02:22:14,857
They did not just insult me.

2682
02:22:15,256 --> 02:22:16,923
They, too, know the match is
very important.

2683
02:22:18,613 --> 02:22:20,239
They should remain where they belong.

2684
02:22:20,624 --> 02:22:21,772
Just because you're holding a bat...

2685
02:22:22,528 --> 02:22:23,856
Maximum 10 overs!

2686
02:22:24,302 --> 02:22:25,427
11 novice players.

2687
02:22:25,927 --> 02:22:26,888
Destroy them!

2688
02:22:28,006 --> 02:22:30,193
If you still go and play with them...

2689
02:22:30,333 --> 02:22:32,848
It's equal to slippering me.

2690
02:22:33,342 --> 02:22:35,247
-Why are they doing this?
-Anna!

2691
02:22:36,771 --> 02:22:37,844
I don't care who turns up...

2692
02:22:38,873 --> 02:22:39,633
We'll play!

2693
02:22:42,693 --> 02:22:44,779
If you throw a stone at the dog...

2694
02:22:44,975 --> 02:22:46,071
it'll get scared and run.

2695
02:22:46,201 --> 02:22:48,113
Try throwing a stone at a beehive...

2696
02:22:48,326 --> 02:22:49,446
we will run in fear.

2697
02:22:49,735 --> 02:22:50,719
Do you know why?

2698
02:22:50,950 --> 02:22:52,667
Because they unite and chase us.

2699
02:22:53,331 --> 02:22:57,112
Similarly, if you're united
you can win anyone and everyone.

2700
02:22:57,775 --> 02:22:58,564
Understood!

2701
02:23:10,094 --> 02:23:12,485
When the society discriminated
as an outcast...

2702
02:23:12,595 --> 02:23:15,360
the Lord took us in like a baby goat.

2703
02:23:15,657 --> 02:23:19,188
With his grace we've been blessed
a life with self-respect.

2704
02:23:19,406 --> 02:23:25,027
We want our children to excel in education,
economics and politics.

2705
02:23:25,126 --> 02:23:27,126
Is the sole purpose of this congregation.

2706
02:23:27,267 --> 02:23:28,821
The young boys of our village.

2707
02:23:29,329 --> 02:23:30,383
Specifically, Ranjith!

2708
02:23:31,181 --> 02:23:34,493
The boys of village have participated
in a huge cricket tournament...

2709
02:23:34,619 --> 02:23:36,524
and are on the path to victory.

2710
02:23:36,945 --> 02:23:39,031
They have entered the finals.

2711
02:23:39,173 --> 02:23:41,657
This is a proud moment for our village.

2712
02:23:41,837 --> 02:23:44,024
We should appreciate our children
for their efforts.

2713
02:23:44,228 --> 02:23:45,938
Things that are beyond their reach...

2714
02:23:46,087 --> 02:23:48,579
the Lord will bless them
with the wisdom to achieve.

2715
02:23:48,727 --> 02:23:51,212
Let us all pray
for their well-being and success.

2716
02:23:51,368 --> 02:23:55,071
Mama, look our boys picture
is in the newspaper.

2717
02:23:55,189 --> 02:23:58,134
I thought they were fooling around
with the bats...

2718
02:23:58,204 --> 02:23:59,977
-Impressive!
-They made it!

2719
02:24:01,305 --> 02:24:04,204
On this day, we have gathered
as a congregation...

2720
02:24:04,649 --> 02:24:07,563
to read the verses for the Lord to hear.

2721
02:24:08,446 --> 02:24:12,660
My Lord, bless this this congregation,
its people...

2722
02:24:12,954 --> 02:24:15,313
and the neighboring villages.

2723
02:24:15,642 --> 02:24:19,964
Young boys of this village are entering
finals in the cricket tournament...

2724
02:24:20,180 --> 02:24:23,545
Please bless them to play united
and win this match.

2725
02:24:23,941 --> 02:24:28,003
For three successful weeks
MCF cricket tournament is going on...

2726
02:24:28,082 --> 02:24:32,884
the finals of 6th year tournament
is going to begin shortly.

2727
02:24:33,043 --> 02:24:36,157
People from different cities
have arrived to watch.

2728
02:24:36,329 --> 02:24:39,325
Successful league players from Madras
are going to arrive.

2729
02:24:39,427 --> 02:24:46,618
We request the fans to co-operate
with the organizers.

2730
02:24:46,982 --> 02:24:51,522
Many-time winner Giant-11
is expected to win this time, too.

2731
02:24:51,578 --> 02:24:54,023
The situation too seems like
it's going to happen.

2732
02:24:54,191 --> 02:24:56,216
But we can't jump to conclusion.

2733
02:24:56,454 --> 02:24:57,913
We have to give it to the
Blue Star team...

2734
02:24:58,061 --> 02:25:01,428
A small team from a village
has reached the finals.

2735
02:25:01,555 --> 02:25:03,181
It's a great achievement.

2736
02:25:07,813 --> 02:25:09,555
I don't care who is going to
come with me.

2737
02:25:10,127 --> 02:25:12,337
Win or lose we'll play
with the players we have.

2738
02:25:14,500 --> 02:25:15,929
Bear this in mind...

2739
02:25:16,811 --> 02:25:18,451
Hate will lead you to destruction.

2740
02:25:19,312 --> 02:25:20,788
But patience will teach you volumes.

2741
02:25:23,602 --> 02:25:26,753
This world has given many reason
not to stay united...

2742
02:25:27,203 --> 02:25:29,264
But to stay united,
there's only one reason.

2743
02:25:29,757 --> 02:25:31,412
Find out that one reason.

2744
02:25:33,145 --> 02:25:35,769
â™ª You should know who you are â™ª

2745
02:25:35,957 --> 02:25:38,496
â™ª Change is evident â™ª

2746
02:25:38,644 --> 02:25:40,902
â™ª It is enough if the elephants knows
its strength â™ª

2747
02:25:42,870 --> 02:25:44,451
Hey, Ranjith, look over there.

2748
02:25:44,491 --> 02:25:46,201
â™ª You should know who you are â™ª

2749
02:25:46,280 --> 02:25:48,467
â™ª Change is evident â™ª

2750
02:25:48,580 --> 02:25:50,235
Rajesh, what took you so long?

2751
02:25:50,393 --> 02:25:51,863
Nothing! On our way,
we hit a slight snag.

2752
02:25:52,328 --> 02:25:53,198
Where is Venkatesh?

2753
02:25:55,003 --> 02:25:56,097
He must be on the way.

2754
02:26:04,798 --> 02:26:06,102
-Come on, everyone!
-Hey, Bharath!

2755
02:26:07,477 --> 02:26:09,787
The critical player on this team
is Nandagopalan.

2756
02:26:13,197 --> 02:26:14,489
He can play any shot.

2757
02:26:14,954 --> 02:26:16,305
He may play for Indian team.

2758
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:19,204
Drive, cut, defense, hook...

2759
02:26:19,297 --> 02:26:20,070
he plays them all!

2760
02:26:20,985 --> 02:26:21,992
Second - Sunil.

2761
02:26:22,917 --> 02:26:24,877
It's not a good sight see him play.

2762
02:26:25,775 --> 02:26:28,627
As far as he's on the crease
the score board keeps ringing.

2763
02:26:28,830 --> 02:26:32,462
Following them, Qasim, Hari, and Abinav...

2764
02:26:32,579 --> 02:26:33,830
will perform one after the other.

2765
02:26:33,938 --> 02:26:35,000
But that's not an issue.

2766
02:26:35,948 --> 02:26:37,033
The issue is their bowling.

2767
02:26:37,976 --> 02:26:42,652
In their team, there's,
Ashwin, Sriram, and Bala.

2768
02:26:42,853 --> 02:26:44,055
One is a King of swing.

2769
02:26:44,360 --> 02:26:45,588
He will assign a slip
and take down wickets.

2770
02:26:45,704 --> 02:26:47,502
Another will bowl yorker
and break the sticks.

2771
02:26:48,807 --> 02:26:49,744
Finally, Bala.

2772
02:26:50,173 --> 02:26:51,220
He's a Ranjith Trophy player.

2773
02:26:51,666 --> 02:26:54,082
We can face his bowling.
Still we will lose wickets.

2774
02:26:54,298 --> 02:26:55,587
He'll bowl to the body.

2775
02:26:56,790 --> 02:26:58,316
But we can win them.

2776
02:26:58,642 --> 02:26:59,702
If we focus and play.

2777
02:26:59,869 --> 02:27:01,735
-Super!
-Come on, everyone!

2778
02:27:01,837 --> 02:27:03,829
Shortly they will spin the toss.

2779
02:27:03,854 --> 02:27:05,307
Rajesh, will Venkatesh come?

2780
02:27:05,332 --> 02:27:07,534
Anna, how long do we wait?

2781
02:27:08,001 --> 02:27:08,477
We'll manage!

2782
02:27:08,516 --> 02:27:11,570
Final call for the captains.
Team Blue Start where are you?

2783
02:27:11,792 --> 02:27:12,750
They're about to spin the toss.

2784
02:27:12,775 --> 02:27:13,939
Hey, win the toss.

2785
02:27:14,770 --> 02:27:17,734
Both the team captains
have arrived on the ground.

2786
02:27:28,216 --> 02:27:29,772
-Fine, fight for it.-Will Giant-11 win the 6th year...

2787
02:27:29,904 --> 02:27:31,180
Will they win?

2788
02:27:31,326 --> 02:27:33,093
It's a big deal our boys
made it to the final.

2789
02:27:34,383 --> 02:27:34,992
Hey...

2790
02:27:36,845 --> 02:27:38,672
This opportunity was not served to us.

2791
02:27:40,142 --> 02:27:42,516
All these years we were waiting
for this day.

2792
02:27:43,748 --> 02:27:45,022
Whether we win or lose...

2793
02:27:45,571 --> 02:27:46,594
we need to play united.

2794
02:27:47,021 --> 02:27:48,739
We should not give until the last ball.

2795
02:27:49,289 --> 02:27:50,029
Get it?

2796
02:27:50,587 --> 02:27:52,501
-Come on! Come on!
-Come on, boys!

2797
02:27:54,282 --> 02:27:55,664
-We need to nail it!
-Come on!

2798
02:27:56,110 --> 02:27:58,626
-Come on.
-Let's bring it on!

2799
02:28:06,586 --> 02:28:09,298
Don't miss it. Win this match!

2800
02:28:09,354 --> 02:28:11,580
Hey, win this match!

2801

Awesome boys!

2802
02:28:21,795 --> 02:28:23,998
The much-awaited final match.

2803
02:28:24,053 --> 02:28:24,561
Give me the ball.

2804
02:28:24,796 --> 02:28:27,133
On the ground rules are same
for everyone.

2805
02:28:27,508 --> 02:28:28,251
You arrived late.

2806
02:28:28,360 --> 02:28:29,190
-Bharath, you bowl.
-Okay, Anna.

2807
02:28:29,282 --> 02:28:30,684

2808
02:28:30,804 --> 02:28:32,761
-It's an easy wicket.-Bharath to Sunil...

2809
02:28:32,889 --> 02:28:35,105
From Thirutheni corner,
Bharath to Sunil.

2810
02:28:35,176 --> 02:28:36,504
That's a good ball.

2811
02:28:36,566 --> 02:28:38,676
-Why don't you hit the ball now?
-Get lost!

2812
02:28:38,824 --> 02:28:41,240
Well bowled. Come on!

2813
02:28:42,068 --> 02:28:44,435
There goes on the leg side.

02:28:44,659 --> 02:28:46,056

Next ball to Sapthaseelan.

2819
02:29:00,918 --> 02:29:02,355
-Hey!
-Let's make double run.

2820
02:29:02,451 --> 02:29:04,048
That's a fantastic boundary.

2821
02:29:04,769 --> 02:29:07,337
Ranjith is making changes
to the fielding set up.

2822
02:29:07,414 --> 02:29:08,636
Sapthaseelan is batting...

2823
02:29:08,716 --> 02:29:10,637

02:29:12,862 --> 02:29:14,243
Significant moment in the match.

2826
02:29:14,377 --> 02:29:16,338

Match it not yet over.
We need to keep order.

2848
02:30:20,289 --> 02:30:22,192
Tighten the bowling.
Every ball counts.

2849
02:30:22,225 --> 02:30:24,368

-Ravi, keep it up.
-He just bowled one ball.

2856
02:30:40,854 --> 02:30:41,457

half a century.

2862
02:30:55,734 --> 02:30:56,923

The score is at 145 runs for 3 wickets.

2867
02:31:06,266 --> 02:31:07,727
Now comes the last ball.

2868
02:31:08,320 --> 02:31:10,624
-Bharath is bowling the last ball.
-Come on, Bharath!

2869
02:31:12,756 --> 02:31:13,876
Oh!

2870
02:31:14,364 --> 02:31:16,929
There's a sixer spiraling to the pavilion.

2871
02:31:17,171 --> 02:31:18,880

2877
02:31:34,419 --> 02:31:35,575
Here comes the first over...

2878
02:31:35,716 --> 02:31:38,630
from Thiruteni corner,
Bala to Babu.

2879
02:31:39,153 --> 02:31:40,418
That's good bowling.

2880
02:31:40,495 --> 02:31:43,560
We have a nick name for Bala.

2881
02:31:43,678 --> 02:31:45,704
It is Bouncer Bala.

2882
02:31:48,841 --> 02:31:49,559
Wow!

2883
02:31:49,687 --> 02:31:51,724
Please wear a helmet and play safe.

2884
02:31:51,809 --> 02:31:54,278
-Hey, where's the batsman?
-Well bowled, my boy.

2885
02:31:54,489 --> 02:31:55,575

Blue Star lost its first wicket.

2888
02:31:59,907 --> 02:32:02,508
Next arrives the team captain, Ranjith.

2889
02:32:02,577 --> 02:32:03,577
He's a good batsman.

2890
02:32:03,679 --> 02:32:05,461
Last match was not good for Ranjith.

2891
02:32:06,242 --> 02:32:07,999
Bala's over. It's a bouncer!

2892
02:32:09,850 --> 02:32:10,733
Fantastic shot!

2893
02:32:10,819 --> 02:32:11,819
Keepers! Keepers! Keepers throw.

2894
02:32:11,915 --> 02:32:12,999
Another one on the leg side.

2895
02:32:13,024 --> 02:32:14,843
That's an excellent shot!

2896
02:32:16,734 --> 02:32:17,178
Hey!

2897
02:32:18,110 --> 02:32:19,125
-Hey!
-What?

2898
02:32:19,172 --> 02:32:20,149
First, hit the ball with your bat.

2899
02:32:20,671 --> 02:32:22,828
I've noticed you when you play a match.

2900
02:32:23,164 --> 02:32:24,734
If the opponent bowler yells at you...

2901
02:32:24,821 --> 02:32:26,476
you yell at him back and get out.

2902
02:32:26,633 --> 02:32:28,296
Smile at the person who glares at you.

2903
02:32:29,821 --> 02:32:30,628
Get lost!

2904
02:32:31,922 --> 02:32:34,226
In these moments,
you be like Tendulkar.

2905
02:32:34,530 --> 02:32:36,247
Show your anger in the game.

2906
02:32:37,530 --> 02:32:39,507
Excellent shot. It's a six!

2907
02:32:39,538 --> 02:32:41,311
-A sixer on the leg side.
-Super shot!

2908
02:32:41,358 --> 02:32:42,929
Ranjith is playing a fantastic game.

2909
02:32:43,017 --> 02:32:45,736
He's playing a patient and composed game.

2910
02:32:46,588 --> 02:32:48,395
-Five slips?
-Come on, bowl!

2911
02:32:48,485 --> 02:32:51,633
Only on TV do we get to see
such a setup.

2912
02:32:51,859 --> 02:32:53,641
They have a strong set up.

2913
02:32:53,666 --> 02:32:54,634
Qasim to Mano!

2914
02:32:54,811 --> 02:32:56,882
Howzzatt!

2915
02:32:57,406 --> 02:32:59,296
Next ball to the power hitter
Ammu Kutty.

2916
02:32:59,914 --> 02:33:02,398
-Straight drive!
-What kind of bowling is this?

2917
02:33:02,514 --> 02:33:04,805
He's proving his mettle. Next shot!

2918
02:33:04,850 --> 02:33:06,366
Howzzatt!

2919
02:33:06,891 --> 02:33:09,258
Next batsman is Rajesh.

2920
02:33:09,671 --> 02:33:12,271
-Don't rush. We have time.-I hope their partnership works.

2921
02:33:13,937 --> 02:33:17,054
Ranjith and Rajesh's partnership
is fantastic.

2922
02:33:17,226 --> 02:33:18,952
It's a super shot on the leg side.

2923
02:33:23,188 --> 02:33:26,492
With this, Ranjith scores half century.

2924
02:33:26,616 --> 02:33:29,258
In 10 overs 81 runs and 3 wickets.

2925
02:33:29,367 --> 02:33:31,813
Guys you're rocking it!

2926
02:33:31,877 --> 02:33:34,710
Only now can we a relief on the
faces of the team and the spectators.

2927
02:33:38,992 --> 02:33:42,124
He's a left-hand-spinner like Ravi Shastri.
Very technical.

2928
02:33:42,536 --> 02:33:43,340
Ah!

2929
02:33:43,664 --> 02:33:44,974
-Amazing ball.
-Hey!

2930
02:33:45,364 --> 02:33:46,888
Hey, what happened?

2931
02:33:47,365 --> 02:33:48,959
-Umpire, please check on him.
-Hey, Ranjith!

2932
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,178
Injuries are common in matches.

2933
02:33:51,241 --> 02:33:52,709
Why did you throw the ball
to the body on purpose?

2934
02:33:52,802 --> 02:33:55,403
You got to be careful and avoid injuries.

3108
02:42:58,475 --> 02:42:59,281
â™ª It is time... â™ª

3109
02:42:59,832 --> 02:43:00,623
â™ª ...you rise â™ª

3110
02:43:01,434 --> 02:43:02,084
â™ª BLUE*STAR â™ª

3111
02:43:04,506 --> 02:43:05,287
â™ª BLUE*STAR â™ª

3112
02:43:05,826 --> 02:43:06,654
â™ª We gonna smash! â™ª

3113
02:43:07,396 --> 02:43:08,317
â™ª BLUE*STAR â™ª

3114
02:43:10,195 --> 02:43:11,030
â™ª BLUE*STAR â™ª

3115
02:43:16,466 --> 02:43:18,388
Gopal, on that day, they were apart...

3116
02:43:18,470 --> 02:43:20,160
but now the village and the colony
have united.

3117
02:43:21,455 --> 02:43:22,239
Bring it on!

3118
02:43:22,929 --> 02:43:25,322
-Come on! Bring it on!
-Come on!

3119
02:43:25,378 --> 02:43:26,795
I dare you to step in.

3120
02:43:26,859 --> 02:43:28,592
You believed
they wouldn't unite at all.

3121
02:43:28,935 --> 02:43:29,911
Now bring it on!

3122
02:43:30,115 --> 02:43:31,654
I dare you to lay your hands on us.

3123
02:43:31,786 --> 02:43:32,332
Come on!

3124
02:43:32,608 --> 02:43:34,076
No one will return alive.

3125
02:43:34,147 --> 02:43:35,615
Try stepping in. You'd know.

3126
02:43:36,256 --> 02:43:37,639
I dare you to lay your hands on us.

3127
02:43:38,395 --> 02:43:40,701
Anyone who dares to
mess with the playground is doomed.

3128
02:43:40,822 --> 02:43:43,135
Hey, below the blue sky...

3129
02:43:43,313 --> 02:43:46,116
tress, birds, animals and humans,

3130
02:43:46,384 --> 02:43:48,865
everyone is equal!

3131
02:46:19,999 --> 02:46:20,342
Beep.
