00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,574
On the
pathways of life,

3
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:30,777
sometimes the road is bumpy.

4
00:00:32,248 --> 00:00:33,746
And sometimes the
terrain is rough.

5
00:00:33,748 --> 00:00:34,948
Not today.

6
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,451
When you need
help getting back on track.

7
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,135
Oh.

8
00:00:56,471 --> 00:00:59,472
Hi, I thought you
might be hungry.

9
00:00:59,474 --> 00:01:01,678
Mm, thanks.

10
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:05,748
- Why, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

11
00:01:12,588 --> 00:01:13,656
Sour cream and onion?

12
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,294
Gross.

13
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:24,666
So.

14
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:27,337
How's the wife?

15
00:01:29,838 --> 00:01:32,474
Your mother's
doing very well, thank you.

16
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:36,342
Ugh, Dad, fried
plantain and curry soup

17
00:01:36,344 --> 00:01:38,814
is not a girl's best friend, ew.

18
00:01:40,148 --> 00:01:42,818
How long do you plan to
keep camping out here, kid?

19
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:50,426
Until Michael quits
being a royal a-hole.

20
00:01:51,894 --> 00:01:54,128
Then I'm sure racking
up a big hotel bill

21
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,229
will do wonders for your
husband's disposition.

22
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:57,700
It's fine, I used your card.

23
00:01:58,868 --> 00:01:59,736
Excuse me?

24
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:04,437
You know, the one with
all the airline mile things,

25
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,176
so in a way, you're welcome.

26
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:11,246
That's not okay.

27
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:17,820
All right.

28
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,693
I'm not gonna be around
forever to bail you out.

29
00:02:26,695 --> 00:02:28,161
You gotta figure out

30
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:29,631
what you're gonna do
with your life, kid.

31
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,570
- I can't find a job, so...
- Finish school.

32
00:02:37,572 --> 00:02:40,173
Look, I'm just

33
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:41,141
I'm waiting to hear

34
00:02:41,143 --> 00:02:43,112
if I'm gonna volunteer
at the cat shelter.

35
00:02:45,214 --> 00:02:47,581
- Ah, Jesus, Lindsey.
- What?

36
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:51,218
I'd get to work with special
needs cats and kittens.

37
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,226
And maybe I'll even be able
to keep one or two for free.

38
00:03:08,304 --> 00:03:10,373
For free, okay, come on.

39
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:13,876
Walk your old man out,
got a plane to catch.

40
00:03:17,613 --> 00:03:18,514
I'm coming.

41
00:03:24,786 --> 00:03:29,422
That was a gift from a very
special student in Kyoto.

42
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:33,796
It's Jizo, protector of women,
children, and travelers.

43
00:03:36,931 --> 00:03:39,869
Now, traditionally, turn around,

44
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,873
traditionally, you
take Jizo statues

45
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,213
and you put 'em in
intersections and paths,

46
00:03:52,347 --> 00:03:54,350
and it always tells you
the right way to go.

47
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:57,820
I thought that would
be appropriate.

48
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:00,923
Does Mom know you're
giving this to me?

49
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:04,827
It's kinda really beautiful.

50
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:08,298
Mom doesn't have
to know everything.

51
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,732
This one's between you and me.

52
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:18,005
Look,

53
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,608
when I get back from the climb,

54
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:25,582
can we all get together
as a family and talk?

55
00:04:38,993 --> 00:04:41,027
And we are live with
Dr. Montgomery Lou

56
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:43,930
as he discusses
saving the world,

57
00:04:43,932 --> 00:04:45,399
one remote village at a time.

58
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:47,700
Dr. Lou, tell us about
your next adventure.

59
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:49,839
Lindsey, I'm
trying to be serious here.

60
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:52,774
Well, it sounds like
I should film then.

61
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,510
If you're being serious.

62
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:00,916
I mean it.

63
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,353
This is the last time.

64
00:05:05,687 --> 00:05:07,421
Your mother and I
love you very much,

65
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:09,488
but you're never
gonna learn anything

66
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,892
if we don't stop doing this.

67
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:15,928
Why don't you take me on
your next adventure then?

68
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,567
Yeah, it will be so much fun.

69
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:19,965
I can be your assistant.

70
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:21,435
You wanna go

71
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:22,570
- on my next adventure, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

72
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:26,976
What if it's too dangerous?

73
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:29,375
Well, why don't
you go to places

74
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:31,844
like Palm Springs or Key West?

75
00:05:31,846 --> 00:05:34,049
Because the University
won't pay for those.

76
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:36,852
I know.

77
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:42,292
Guess I'd better stay
stay here then, huh?

78
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:45,461
In case you need me to
bail you out, right?

79
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:49,932
Right.

80
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:04,947
Go see your mother.

81
00:06:06,414 --> 00:06:07,382
She misses you.

82
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:13,623
And I'm gonna miss you.

83
00:06:15,156 --> 00:06:16,522
But I'll be back.

84
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,099
Thanks, Dad.

85
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:36,111
- I
- love you, kiddo.

86
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:39,349
I love you, too.

87
00:07:44,846 --> 00:07:47,513
Should have called a caterer.

88
00:07:47,515 --> 00:07:49,015
You got the dessert tray, right?

89
00:07:49,017 --> 00:07:49,851
Uh-huh.

90
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:54,156
I've got something, I've got
it under control, it's fine.

91
00:08:01,796 --> 00:08:02,764
Have a cookie, Mom.

92
00:08:10,238 --> 00:08:13,175
Be ready for many
pleasures in the near future.

93
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,144
Great.

94
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:17,012
In bed.

95
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:21,651
You know, after you read
a fortune, you say, no?

96
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:35,631
The shrimp looks
beautiful, babe.

97
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,637
How's Miss
Lou holding up?

98
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,475
Good.

99
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:49,174
Any thoughts on
going back to school?

100
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:50,843
Follow in your
father's footsteps?

101
00:08:50,845 --> 00:08:53,748
Uh, I'm not really
the professor type.

102
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:56,683
He's a tough act to follow.

103
00:08:56,685 --> 00:08:59,184
You're probably busy
with your career.

104
00:08:59,186 --> 00:09:04,192
Uh, no, not really, not
anything, yeah.

105
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:11,063
Well, it was probably
some 20 years ago

106
00:09:11,065 --> 00:09:13,569
I went to the Atacama
Desert with your father.

107
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,171
A trailblazer in
geological studies.

108
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:18,974
He will be sorely missed.

109
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:22,244
Thanks.

110
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:30,683
Liam, did you tell your Aunt
Sandy how you're leaving me?

111
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:33,919
I'm performing for
six weeks in Vienna.

112
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:35,755
Liam, that's wonderful.

113
00:09:35,757 --> 00:09:37,289
Did you hear that JoJo?

114
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:39,693
Lil' Leelee is going to France.

115
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:40,894
Osterreich.

116
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:43,697
We've got a significant
following in Europe.

117
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:45,164
Mm.

118
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,269
It's nothing, really,
I just play from the heart.

119
00:09:50,973 --> 00:09:52,575
What's the deal with Liam?

120
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:54,877
Is he serious about her or what?

121
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,679
I don't know, why?

122
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:01,316
Your brother's hot.

123
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:03,717
Look at him.

124
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:08,121
Are you okay?

125
00:10:08,123 --> 00:10:09,389
Gross.

126
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:11,294
He's your cousin,
think about that.

127
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:22,070
Hey.

128
00:10:26,374 --> 00:10:27,208
Any luck?

129
00:10:28,343 --> 00:10:31,711
This one was starting to
bend but then you came in.

130
00:10:31,713 --> 00:10:32,348
Right.

131
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:36,719
You think Dad's gonna
come back and haunt us?

132
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,589
Seriously?

133
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:44,359
Okay, not haunt, but visit us?

134
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:47,195
Check in and make
sure we're okay?

135
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:52,168
Look, they haven't
even confirmed he's dead.

136
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:55,669
He could still be alive,
stuck up on that mountain,

137
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:57,039
waiting for someone to find him.

138
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:01,173
Then why'd we have a funeral?

139
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:03,345
Because Mom likes
throwing parties.

140
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,850
Hey, Linds, you have,
um, gas in your car?

141
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:11,621
Uh, someone will be there soon.

142
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,893
There was a mix-up
at the funeral home.

143
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:23,265
Apparently we have Ming Lu.

144
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,434
No.

145
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:28,336
I really need you to do this.

146
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,371
Oh, this is so stupid.

147
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:33,707
Come on, I can't ask Monty.

148
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:36,476
It's too much for him, I
gotta be here with Mom.

149
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:38,377
Lindsey, please.

150
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:40,682
This has been hard on
all of us, you know.

151
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:44,217
We didn't get to say
goodbye to him, either.

152
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,787
They couldn't even supply
a photo or properly ID him...

153
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:49,489
Lindsey, don't.

154
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:51,790
I'm going to be gone
for almost two months.

155
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:53,326
Mom needs a lot of support.

156
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:56,328
Now, just be the daughter
she never had, okay?

157
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,365
That's all I'm asking.

158
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:16,448
So this is a little more
information on the process.

159
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,483
I really hope you'll
use our services...

160
00:12:18,853 --> 00:12:20,319
Hello there.

161
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:21,990
Thank you, this is yours.

162
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,062
If it means anything,
they're both in heaven.

163
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:28,797
Right.

164
00:12:35,302 --> 00:12:36,468
Hey!

165
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,438
Hey, come on,
that's my car, man!

166
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,872
Come on, don't do this to me.

167
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:42,744
Oh!

168
00:12:43,411 --> 00:12:44,977
Ugh.

169
00:13:29,523 --> 00:13:31,924
Great, a walker.

170
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:33,592
What do ya think, DUI?

171
00:13:33,594 --> 00:13:35,395
Working girl?

172
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,331
Maybe both.

173
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:48,877
Pay attention, boys.

174
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:53,882
Let me show ya how a real
man gets the job done.

175
00:14:05,526 --> 00:14:07,125
Excuse me, miss?

176
00:14:07,127 --> 00:14:09,194
May I ask you a question?

177
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:11,898
Why you walking when
you should be driving?

178
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,600
Pretty girl like you
liable to cause an accident

179
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,101
making all these men
swerve their trucks

180
00:14:15,103 --> 00:14:18,404
to get a better look
at ya.

181
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:20,606
Jerome Carlyle, and you are?

182
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:21,442
Lindsey.

183
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:23,813
Lindsey.

184
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:27,313
Lindsey, I like that, it's
got a nice ring to it.

185
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:30,949
Now is that Lind-say
or Lind-see?

186
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:32,651
Just Lindsey.

187
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:35,825
Well, Just Lindsey, you
can call me Jerry, with a Y.

188
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:39,324
Hey, boys, this pretty
lady here needs a vehicle.

189
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:40,261
Let's help her out.

190
00:14:57,478 --> 00:14:58,678
Tell you what

191
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,313
I'll give a call down
to the tow company

192
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:01,547
and I'll have your
car back faster

193
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:03,082
than a jack rabbit in heat.

194
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:05,018
My life is in that car.

195
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,287
I know, I'll get
ya taken care of.

196
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:08,958
That's the Jerry
Carlyle promise.

197
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:11,658
'Cause I'm not taking
care of customers,

198
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,228
I'm taking care of friends.

199
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:18,997
Mm, yeah, I've seen
your commercials.

200
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:21,202
Maybe you recognize
me from my TV show.

201
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,974
Back to back Emmys
in '98 and '99.

202
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:27,243
Oh, my god.

203
00:15:28,642 --> 00:15:30,709
Oh, my god, Troy Thunderton?

204
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:32,111
That's it.

205
00:15:32,113 --> 00:15:36,082
Oh, oh, uh, where
there's Thunder?

206
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:37,951
There's a ton of lightning.

207
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,188
You may not need a car right
now but when you're ready,

208
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,524
I want you to remember me.

209
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,058
Yeah.

210
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,028
- Yeah, I will, thanks.
- Thank you.

211
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,099
This is too weird.

212
00:15:51,432 --> 00:15:52,267
Oh.

213
00:16:00,642 --> 00:16:01,477
Thank you.

214
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:04,545
Lind-see.

215
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:13,681
Hey, you think you've had
enough there, Mom, come on.

216
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:19,118
Look, I don't want you to
worry about any of this, right?

217
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,085
We'll take care of it.

218
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:22,121
I told him not
to go, he insisted.

219
00:17:22,123 --> 00:17:23,255
It was work.

220
00:17:23,257 --> 00:17:24,360
That's who Dad was.

221
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:27,763
Everest was always on his list.

222
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,295
Can we get a dog?

223
00:17:30,297 --> 00:17:32,598
A dog's a lot of
responsibility, Mont.

224
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,667
I don't even know
when the bills are due.

225
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:36,235
He had several accounts.

226
00:17:36,237 --> 00:17:37,669
He never trusted
me with anything.

227
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:40,305
Mom, Mom,
Lindsey can help.

228
00:17:40,307 --> 00:17:42,307
Really, Liam, with what?

229
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:44,209
By drinking all my wine?

230
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:47,345
She's got nothing going
on and she can help.

231
00:17:47,347 --> 00:17:48,848
Thanks for the
vote of confidence.

232
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,387
We gotta get going.

233
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:56,621
- Postpone your vacation.
- It's a European tour.

234
00:17:56,623 --> 00:17:58,123
You can't just cancel
a European tour.

235
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,426
He has
a lot of fans overseas.

236
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:02,495
I'll call you
from the airport.

237
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:03,830
Caroline, just remember

238
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,035
you're a shining star
of love and peace.

239
00:18:07,535 --> 00:18:09,537
Leave, just like your father.

240
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:18,643
All right, all right.

241
00:18:18,645 --> 00:18:20,248
I'll give you a call, all right?

242
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,617
Lindsey, you heading out?

243
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:27,419
No, I thought I'd stay
here tonight, family time.

244
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:29,221
Sign the divorce papers yet?

245
00:18:29,223 --> 00:18:30,122
No.

246
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:31,791
- Why not?
- Not now, Liam.

247
00:18:31,793 --> 00:18:33,525
If it's over, let's
just get it over with

248
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:35,227
so she can get on with her life.

249
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:36,496
She's gonna have a lot to do

250
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:37,729
to get her feet
back on the ground.

251
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:38,898
Okay, I'm standing right here.

252
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,833
Look, just do
something with your life.

253
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:43,302
Mom, can you please
tell Liam to shut up?

254
00:18:43,304 --> 00:18:44,903
We don't say
that in this house.

255
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:45,838
You know that.

256
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,873
Sign the papers, just do it.

257
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,409
Mont, you're the man
of the house now,

258
00:18:50,411 --> 00:18:52,081
so take care of Mom.

259
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:56,084
See ya.

260
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,225
Well.

261
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:08,226
Good to have you, Lindsey.

262
00:19:08,228 --> 00:19:09,131
Better late than never.

263
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,266
No more chips.

264
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:15,301
Can you please set the alarm?

265
00:19:15,303 --> 00:19:16,569
That was your dad's job.

266
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:18,173
You just press the button.

267
00:19:19,507 --> 00:19:21,373
Yeah, you figured it out.

268
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,677
He'd be really proud.

269
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:27,181
Hey, Linds, what are
you doing tomorrow?

270
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:34,219
The last time we hung
out was at my graduation

271
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:35,955
and you were fighting
with Michael.

272
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:37,590
We'll see.

273
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:38,694
I have a lot going on.

274
00:19:42,697 --> 00:19:44,263
You sound like Dad.

275
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:44,900
Good.

276
00:19:52,472 --> 00:19:56,177
Have you thought
about college or work?

277
00:19:57,578 --> 00:19:59,844
My palm reader said
my gift is really strong

278
00:19:59,846 --> 00:20:01,716
and I just need to
harness my powers.

279
00:20:02,616 --> 00:20:04,249
See that?

280
00:20:04,251 --> 00:20:05,251
That means that I'm intuitive

281
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:06,819
and have a keen sixth sense.

282
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:09,892
And that one means that
destiny will dictate my life.

283
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:14,395
I don't have that
line on my hand.

284
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:17,763
She probably just told you that.

285
00:20:17,765 --> 00:20:18,997
It's a science, Lindsey.

286
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:20,967
No two palms are alike.

287
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,770
They're like snowflakes.

288
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:25,174
Don't be dumb, Monty.

289
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:29,443
It's just like
practicing the kazoo.

290
00:20:30,545 --> 00:20:32,381
I really need to
focus and get better.

291
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:37,582
I moved up here abut 20 years
ago, started the dealership,

292
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:39,619
and I've been here ever since.

293
00:20:40,555 --> 00:20:41,821
Well, speak of the devil.

294
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,889
You didn't tell me
your car got towed.

295
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:45,291
Surprise.

296
00:20:45,293 --> 00:20:46,292
How are you
gonna pay for that?

297
00:20:46,294 --> 00:20:49,562
You owe this gentleman a
great deal of gratitude.

298
00:20:49,564 --> 00:20:50,896
You must be Monty.

299
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:53,365
Holy smokes, you're
the Thunderton guy.

300
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:56,571
Yeah, well, I left that
life behind a while ago.

301
00:20:57,505 --> 00:20:58,803
It was fun while it lasted.

302
00:20:58,805 --> 00:21:01,209
You two used to
watch him nonstop.

303
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:02,945
I remember.

304
00:21:04,612 --> 00:21:08,546
Well, um, thank you again
for all that you've done.

305
00:21:08,548 --> 00:21:12,517
It's, uh, crazy here and
I haven't had much help.

306
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:15,454
That's all right,
no need to explain.

307
00:21:15,456 --> 00:21:17,355
I do need to get back to
the dealership, though.

308
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:19,661
I'm kinda like the mother
hen to all them cocks.

309
00:21:20,995 --> 00:21:22,661
Uh,
well, thank you.

310
00:21:22,663 --> 00:21:24,530
You're welcome, any time.

311
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:25,831
Oh, can I get a
ride back from you?

312
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,367
- Would that be all right?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

313
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:29,004
Great.

314
00:21:37,944 --> 00:21:41,046
I've got a confession to make.

315
00:21:41,048 --> 00:21:42,783
I really want your phone number.

316
00:21:48,422 --> 00:21:49,524
Don't make me beg.

317
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:05,841
You'll be seeing me
real soon, I promise.

318
00:22:09,544 --> 00:22:12,381
Oh, my god, Troy Thunderton
totally just hit on me.

319
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,548
Hey, Mr., uh,

320
00:24:27,815 --> 00:24:30,181
- Dr. Armstrong.
- Miss Lou.

321
00:24:30,183 --> 00:24:31,519
Always a terrific pleasure.

322
00:24:32,687 --> 00:24:34,488
I wish it was under
better circumstances.

323
00:24:37,024 --> 00:24:39,024
Do you have a minute?

324
00:24:39,026 --> 00:24:42,861
Sure, yeah, um, you
wanna take a seat?

325
00:24:42,863 --> 00:24:44,596
Yeah.

326
00:24:44,598 --> 00:24:47,533
Optimism is a beautiful
character trait, Lindsey.

327
00:24:47,535 --> 00:24:49,204
I always promote hope and faith,

328
00:24:50,604 --> 00:24:51,571
but even if your dad survived...

329
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,238
But no one could put
him in the same area

330
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,707
as the avalanche.

331
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:57,543
He'd be without
food and shelter.

332
00:24:57,545 --> 00:24:59,777
For him to be separated from
his Sherpas in that terrain

333
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:01,950
and survive is incomprehensible.

334
00:25:05,886 --> 00:25:06,720
Still.

335
00:25:08,956 --> 00:25:10,788
There's a chance?

336
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:14,061
Yes, yes, there is
a chance, Lindsey.

337
00:25:17,163 --> 00:25:19,631
If anybody can get themselves
out of a situation like that,

338
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:20,201
it's your dad.

339
00:25:21,835 --> 00:25:24,303
In all the years we traveled
across this globe together,

340
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:26,170
your father got us out

341
00:25:26,172 --> 00:25:30,511
of one impossible
situation after another.

342
00:25:31,778 --> 00:25:34,280
I entrusted that
man with my life.

343
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,151
And he always came through.

344
00:25:40,654 --> 00:25:41,956
I'm not much help, am I?

345
00:25:44,257 --> 00:25:45,890
You know, if I could,

346
00:25:45,892 --> 00:25:47,996
I'd go over there and
look for him myself.

347
00:25:50,698 --> 00:25:52,267
Well, maybe
that's what I'll do.

348
00:25:53,834 --> 00:25:55,135
Follow your heart, Lindsey.

349
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:02,006
How do
I get to Everest?

350
00:26:03,244 --> 00:26:05,143
Searching the web on
how to cook chicken breasts.

351
00:26:06,346 --> 00:26:10,349
How do I plan a
trip to Mount Everest?

352
00:26:12,053 --> 00:26:13,619
Searching the web
for trips to music fest.

353
00:26:13,621 --> 00:26:15,086
You've got to be kidding me.

354
00:26:15,088 --> 00:26:17,755
I found five results
for digging in your knees.

355
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,361
A round trip ticket
to Lhasa, China

356
00:26:22,363 --> 00:26:26,601
would be $2,148 with taxes.

357
00:26:27,867 --> 00:26:29,767
Okay.

358
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:34,105
And an additional
one-way ticket back

359
00:26:34,107 --> 00:26:37,909
will be $1,168 with taxes.

360
00:26:37,911 --> 00:26:39,713
Wow.

361
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:42,715
Okay, I'm not accusing you

362
00:26:42,717 --> 00:26:44,149
of not knowing how to
do your job or anything,

363
00:26:44,151 --> 00:26:46,986
but I was finding a lot
lower prices online.

364
00:26:46,988 --> 00:26:49,658
Like, a lot lower.

365
00:26:50,658 --> 00:26:53,792
Right, and if you are
a part of the group trek

366
00:26:53,794 --> 00:26:58,300
to Everest Base Camp, you'll
need to budget in for yaks.

367
00:27:00,401 --> 00:27:01,800
Yaks?

368
00:27:01,802 --> 00:27:04,637
I'd allow for
two to three yaks,

369
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:07,609
but you'll have to make those
arrangements when you arrive.

370
00:27:08,976 --> 00:27:09,610
Okay.

371
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,680
Are we buying a ticket today

372
00:27:15,682 --> 00:27:17,181
or are we just window shopping?

373
00:27:17,183 --> 00:27:20,386
Well, are there, like, any
promos or discounts going on?

374
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:24,089
Planning a trip to Everest

375
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:27,629
is different than
going to Disneyland.

376
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:30,728
Well, I've never been
to Disneyland either

377
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:34,332
so I wouldn't know, thanks.

378
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:37,169
We're talking GORE-TEX
tents, sleeping equipment,

379
00:27:37,171 --> 00:27:39,071
layered seasonal
clothing, that's huge,

380
00:27:39,073 --> 00:27:40,839
the temps are gonna suck.

381
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:44,176
Then you've got your oxygen
bottles, masks, regulators,

382
00:27:44,178 --> 00:27:47,679
medical kit, rescue
insurance, satellite phones,

383
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:50,416
and then a bunch of other
stuff that I'm forgetting.

384
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,851
Yeah, I'll probably
need a scarf, too.

385
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:55,120
How many people
are on your team?

386
00:27:55,122 --> 00:27:57,922
Oh, no one
yet, so far, just me.

387
00:27:57,924 --> 00:27:59,725
I've been climbing
for the past 10 years,

388
00:27:59,727 --> 00:28:02,730
I don't recognize you from
any climbs, you, Mazama?

389
00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:07,099
Uh, I went to outdoor
school, like, in seventh grade.

390
00:28:07,101 --> 00:28:09,735
I mean, we went on a
hike that was uphill.

391
00:28:09,737 --> 00:28:12,170
Do you have any mittens
that are cheaper?

392
00:28:12,172 --> 00:28:13,240
These are like $30.

393
00:28:14,408 --> 00:28:16,774
Uh, for just the
basic gear alone

394
00:28:16,776 --> 00:28:19,311
you're looking at like
four k, and that's like,

395
00:28:19,313 --> 00:28:20,382
bare minimum stuff.

396
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:23,314
Look, if you're serious,

397
00:28:23,316 --> 00:28:24,719
you'd better consider
getting a guide.

398
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:29,455
You wanna go climb Everest?

399
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:33,395
It's a little out of my
league, but I do know a guy.

400
00:28:35,095 --> 00:28:36,430
Here you go, that guy.

401
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:40,466
Oh, yeah, that's tragic.

402
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,970
Local climber, used to
come in all the time.

403
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,006
- That's my dad.
- Oh.

404
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:51,179
Whoa, so sorry.

405
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:53,748
Thanks.

406
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,381
I'd love to hear
stories sometime

407
00:28:57,383 --> 00:28:59,887
if you wanted to come
in and tell a story.

408
00:29:02,757 --> 00:29:03,757
Yeah, maybe later.

409
00:29:04,892 --> 00:29:05,727
Scoot.

410
00:29:06,526 --> 00:29:07,761
It's Scott.

411
00:29:08,828 --> 00:29:09,830
I lost a bet.

412
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:13,767
Dammit.

413
00:29:18,037 --> 00:29:19,303
Where's Mom?

414
00:29:19,305 --> 00:29:22,110
Buying milk and wine.

415
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:26,881
So, is this it?

416
00:29:28,248 --> 00:29:29,450
This is what you do?

417
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,192
He's a mobile night light.

418
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,728
Neat.

419
00:29:43,898 --> 00:29:46,501
Christmas is gonna be
really weird this year, huh?

420
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,370
Maybe.

421
00:29:52,472 --> 00:29:54,742
Why didn't
Michael come to the funeral?

422
00:29:57,443 --> 00:29:58,278
Busy.

423
00:30:02,348 --> 00:30:03,383
I miss Dad.

424
00:30:05,286 --> 00:30:07,756
Yeah, me too.

425
00:30:29,075 --> 00:30:29,975
What do you want?

426
00:30:29,977 --> 00:30:31,409
I'm headed out.

427
00:30:31,411 --> 00:30:33,879
I need to get the papers
filed in the next couple days

428
00:30:33,881 --> 00:30:35,848
so if you could just
get those signed.

429
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,849
You're going out?

430
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:38,082
I really gotta go.

431
00:30:38,084 --> 00:30:39,787
I'm, like, headed out
the door right now.

432
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:44,089
Yeah, well, maybe
I'll run into you.

433
00:30:44,091 --> 00:30:45,093
I'm out too.

434
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,862
Girls night, yay.

435
00:30:49,162 --> 00:30:50,128
Bye.

436
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:50,931
Michael?

437
00:31:07,981 --> 00:31:12,186
Jizo, protector of women,
children, and travelers.

438
00:31:13,988 --> 00:31:18,559
You take Jizo statues and put
'em in intersections and paths

439
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:21,659
and it always tells you
the right way to go.

440
00:31:21,661 --> 00:31:22,564
Lindsey.

441
00:31:23,664 --> 00:31:26,163
Lindsey, I like that, that's
got a nice ring to it.

442
00:31:26,165 --> 00:31:28,001
Guess I better
stay here then, huh?

443
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:32,440
In case you need me to
bail you out, right?

444
00:31:37,544 --> 00:31:38,379
Thanks, Dad.

445
00:31:51,357 --> 00:31:53,358
- Hey, good evening.
- Hi.

446
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,498
We received a call that
there was a dead body in a car.

447
00:32:02,937 --> 00:32:03,567
What?

448
00:32:03,569 --> 00:32:04,669
Are you all right?

449
00:32:04,671 --> 00:32:07,605
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I was just taking a nap.

450
00:32:07,607 --> 00:32:10,274
Well, you can't stay here.

451
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:12,177
You were sleeping in your car

452
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:14,349
in the parking lot of
the police station.

453
00:32:17,017 --> 00:32:19,450
Oh, sorry.

454
00:32:19,452 --> 00:32:22,553
- I need you to move along.
- Okay, yeah, no problem.

455
00:32:22,555 --> 00:32:24,258
- Have a safe night.
- Thank you.

456
00:32:33,033 --> 00:32:33,998
What's wrong?

457
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,233
Michael's working late

458
00:32:35,235 --> 00:32:37,438
and I thought I heard
someone in the backyard.

459
00:32:39,105 --> 00:32:39,940
Sure.

460
00:32:59,293 --> 00:33:00,628
Meatloaf Wednesday.

461
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,164
It's hot.

462
00:33:05,431 --> 00:33:07,134
It was your dad's favorite.

463
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:09,938
I never really
cared much for it.

464
00:33:11,438 --> 00:33:14,105
Well, you don't need to
make it until he gets home.

465
00:33:14,107 --> 00:33:14,741
Who's this guy?

466
00:33:16,209 --> 00:33:17,208
Some survival guy

467
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,076
they drop off in the wilderness.

468
00:33:19,078 --> 00:33:20,312
Okay, why are
you watching this?

469
00:33:20,314 --> 00:33:22,016
- Don't watch this stuff.
- Well, they say that.

470
00:33:28,788 --> 00:33:30,490
Your brother
made it to Austria.

471
00:33:32,258 --> 00:33:33,094
Cool.

472
00:33:38,498 --> 00:33:39,299
Lindsey,

473
00:33:42,102 --> 00:33:45,070
I just, I feel like we
have so much to talk about.

474
00:33:45,072 --> 00:33:47,375
I mean, I've barely
seen you in three years.

475
00:33:49,043 --> 00:33:50,378
Where do you wanna start?

476
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:54,047
How about my wedding?

477
00:33:59,186 --> 00:33:59,988
Not tonight.

478
00:34:01,654 --> 00:34:04,558
Kind of mother doesn't attend
her own daughter's wedding?

479
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:07,324
Dad was there.

480
00:34:07,326 --> 00:34:08,592
He made an effort to be there

481
00:34:08,594 --> 00:34:09,997
and he was never
here to begin with.

482
00:34:11,098 --> 00:34:11,797
I'm sorry.

483
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,267
I'll make the next one.

484
00:34:58,578 --> 00:35:00,647
Good morning, sleepyhead.

485
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:03,084
Are you hungry?

486
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:07,121
Make sure you save
some for Monty.

487
00:35:12,225 --> 00:35:14,259
Did someone
bring this over?

488
00:35:14,261 --> 00:35:17,495
No, I thought
I'd make breakfast.

489
00:35:17,497 --> 00:35:18,696
I'm allowed to, aren't I?

490
00:35:18,698 --> 00:35:21,835
What, you thought I got up
early and went to McDonald's?

491
00:35:23,169 --> 00:35:25,370
McDonald's
doesn't have bacon.

492
00:35:25,372 --> 00:35:29,743
So, have you considered
applying for a job?

493
00:35:32,712 --> 00:35:33,547
Mom.

494
00:35:34,781 --> 00:35:37,348
You know, I thought maybe
we could go to the mall today,

495
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:40,384
pick you out a
really cute outfit,

496
00:35:40,386 --> 00:35:42,920
go to one of the cosmetic
counters, get you a makeover,

497
00:35:42,922 --> 00:35:45,526
and maybe clean you
up a little bit.

498
00:35:46,627 --> 00:35:47,462
For who?

499
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,096
I just thought that maybe

500
00:35:51,098 --> 00:35:53,330
you would feel
better about yourself

501
00:35:53,332 --> 00:35:54,868
if you put yourself together.

502
00:35:55,935 --> 00:35:57,437
I feel awesome about myself.

503
00:35:58,638 --> 00:36:00,774
It's everyone else that seems
to have a problem with me.

504
00:36:08,848 --> 00:36:09,683
Hungry?

505
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:15,723
Hey, what's up?

506
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:21,562
I had a dream that
he was still alive

507
00:36:24,797 --> 00:36:26,901
waiting for us to come get him.

508
00:36:28,234 --> 00:36:31,905
Monty, was it a dream
or a psychic vision?

509
00:36:33,406 --> 00:36:34,508
It was a vision.

510
00:36:37,678 --> 00:36:38,679
It was real.

511
00:36:45,551 --> 00:36:47,254
Sorry, I'm just dumb.

512
00:36:47,988 --> 00:36:49,857
No, you're not.

513
00:36:52,893 --> 00:36:53,728
You're gifted.

514
00:36:55,728 --> 00:36:57,531
You just need to
practice your gift.

515
00:37:03,337 --> 00:37:04,472
Queen of Hearts.

516
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:10,911
Ace of Spades.

517
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:13,514
Ace of clubs.

518
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,248
There's too damn many of them.

519
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,250
You've been through
the deck twice.

520
00:37:19,252 --> 00:37:21,652
I figured you'd get
at least one right.

521
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:27,926
Hello?

522
00:37:27,928 --> 00:37:30,295
Is that an
angel on the other line?

523
00:37:30,297 --> 00:37:33,301
I'm trying to reach a young
lady by the name of Lindsey.

524
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:37,402
Well, you got her.

525
00:37:37,404 --> 00:37:38,036
We'll see about that.

526
00:37:38,038 --> 00:37:39,437
You alone?

527
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:41,272
Sorta.

528
00:37:41,274 --> 00:37:42,074
I thought
you might be interested

529
00:37:42,076 --> 00:37:43,811
- in making a little money.
- Yes!

530
00:37:45,312 --> 00:37:47,312
What did you have in mind?

531
00:37:47,314 --> 00:37:48,446
I'm looking for a
couple real special people

532
00:37:48,448 --> 00:37:49,948
to help me out,

533
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,949
and I immediately thought
of you and your brother.

534
00:37:51,951 --> 00:37:52,786
Really?

535
00:37:53,853 --> 00:37:55,256
Um, thanks.

536
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,258
What should I wear?

537
00:38:02,361 --> 00:38:03,597
Why are we doing this?

538
00:38:04,598 --> 00:38:06,031
Well, I've been thinking.

539
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,600
If you're going to develop
your psychic powers,

540
00:38:08,602 --> 00:38:10,534
then you're gonna
need special training.

541
00:38:10,536 --> 00:38:11,770
If we're gonna hire someone,

542
00:38:11,772 --> 00:38:12,974
it's going to cost
a lot of money.

543
00:38:14,408 --> 00:38:15,806
Why do you care?

544
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,643
I wanna help

545
00:38:18,611 --> 00:38:21,248
because that's what
big sisters do.

546
00:38:31,325 --> 00:38:32,589
Chris Black to
the corral please,

547
00:38:32,591 --> 00:38:34,294
Chris Black to the corral.

548
00:38:38,964 --> 00:38:39,598
Of course.

549
00:38:40,966 --> 00:38:42,535
A deal just walked off the lot.

550
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,670
That's money out of your
pocket, what's your excuse?

551
00:38:45,672 --> 00:38:47,672
I was obviously
in the bathroom.

552
00:38:47,674 --> 00:38:48,509
Oh.

553
00:38:49,975 --> 00:38:51,442
Ah.

554
00:38:51,444 --> 00:38:52,312
You've got a phone.

555
00:38:53,513 --> 00:38:55,513
Keep someone on the other
line while you taking a leak.

556
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:57,781
Two eyes on the lot at
all times, you understand?

557
00:38:57,783 --> 00:38:59,817
Sure, mm-hmm, eyes on the lot.

558
00:38:59,819 --> 00:39:00,953
Don't wanna miss anything.

559
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:03,554
Don't piss on my leg and
tell me it's raining, son.

560
00:39:03,556 --> 00:39:05,426
Now go out there
and sell me a truck.

561
00:39:18,705 --> 00:39:21,373
You think I was
too rough on him?

562
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:24,812
No, no, not at all,
just, uh, tough love.

563
00:39:26,379 --> 00:39:27,381
Tough love.

564
00:39:28,482 --> 00:39:32,150
You're one of a kind,
Lindsey Lou, you know that?

565
00:39:32,152 --> 00:39:34,486
Uh, I don't know if
it's an issue or not,

566
00:39:34,488 --> 00:39:36,855
but we don't know
anything about cars.

567
00:39:36,857 --> 00:39:38,922
I've only had my
license for three months

568
00:39:38,924 --> 00:39:40,958
and I don't know how
to parallel park.

569
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,159
It's all right.

570
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:44,596
I'll take enthusiasm
over experience any day.

571
00:39:44,598 --> 00:39:46,931
You know what else
is important, son?

572
00:39:46,933 --> 00:39:47,768
Drive.

573
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:50,004
Desire.

574
00:39:51,671 --> 00:39:54,505
Drive and desire, that's all
you need in this business.

575
00:39:54,507 --> 00:39:55,408
Take a look out there.

576
00:39:56,442 --> 00:39:59,412
Any idiot can sell a car.

577
00:40:02,415 --> 00:40:04,415
Anyhoo, random drug testing

578
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:06,150
is the second Thursday
of every month.

579
00:40:06,152 --> 00:40:08,855
The only thing they're looking
for is cocaine or heroin.

580
00:40:11,991 --> 00:40:13,593
That gonna be a problem for you?

581
00:40:14,761 --> 00:40:17,529
I'm on four allergy
medications and I...

582
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:18,366
Ahem!

583
00:40:19,598 --> 00:40:21,433
Not a problem.

584
00:40:21,435 --> 00:40:24,739
Well, are you here to keep
me company or sell a car?

585
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:26,870
I'll sell two cars.

586
00:40:26,872 --> 00:40:28,441
Oh, fantastic.

587
00:40:29,442 --> 00:40:30,477
That's great.

588
00:40:35,114 --> 00:40:38,583
Listen, do me a favor, will ya?

589
00:40:38,585 --> 00:40:41,455
Just keep an eye on your
brother, keep him out of trouble.

590
00:40:42,689 --> 00:40:44,625
Can't I stay
in here with you instead?

591
00:40:46,091 --> 00:40:47,491
We're gonna be spending
a lot of time together.

592
00:40:47,493 --> 00:40:48,592
That's a promise.

593
00:40:49,696 --> 00:40:51,065
Relax, you're gonna be fine.

594
00:40:53,533 --> 00:40:54,567
Now go get your job done.

595
00:40:55,902 --> 00:40:57,569
Yeah, oh, great.

596
00:40:57,571 --> 00:40:58,937
Wait, shh, shh.

597
00:40:58,939 --> 00:41:00,605
You hear that?

598
00:41:00,607 --> 00:41:02,574
You hear that?

599
00:41:02,576 --> 00:41:03,542
Wait, wait, you hear that?

600
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:08,047
Uh, no, what I am
supposed to be hearing?

601
00:41:10,683 --> 00:41:12,250
Thunderton, Lindsey.

602
00:41:13,419 --> 00:41:17,821
Thunderton, the quiet rumble
of approaching Thunderton.

603
00:41:17,823 --> 00:41:20,525
And where there's
Thunderton, there's what?

604
00:41:21,328 --> 00:41:22,125
- Lightning.
- There's lightning.

605
00:41:22,127 --> 00:41:23,261
That's right.

606
00:41:23,263 --> 00:41:24,596
What do you think?

607
00:41:24,598 --> 00:41:25,464
You think it will strike twice?

608
00:41:25,466 --> 00:41:27,565
I don't really
know what that means,

609
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:29,804
but it sounds really hot.

610
00:41:30,937 --> 00:41:31,772
That's my girl.

611
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,742
Now go on and go get it.

612
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:48,987
This place is amazeballs.

613
00:41:57,297 --> 00:41:58,862
We're not selling cars here.

614
00:41:58,864 --> 00:42:00,964
We're selling personality
and lifestyle.

615
00:42:00,966 --> 00:42:03,067
If they don't like you, they
ain't buying, all right?

616
00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:05,636
They ain't coming here to
make friends or kill time.

617
00:42:05,638 --> 00:42:07,772
They're here to buy a damn car.

618
00:42:07,774 --> 00:42:10,308
Always be closing, you
ever hear that phrase?

619
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,308
The ABCs?

620
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,546
- No.
- No.

621
00:42:13,747 --> 00:42:16,580
Well, whatever, I've got a
bit of a different approach.

622
00:42:16,582 --> 00:42:19,486
S-T-D.

623
00:42:21,721 --> 00:42:23,821
Seal the deal, all right?

624
00:42:23,823 --> 00:42:27,025
That's when you ask for the
sale and if they don't budge,

625
00:42:27,027 --> 00:42:30,661
you lie, you beg, you steal,
whatever you have to do,

626
00:42:30,663 --> 00:42:31,763
you make the deal.

627
00:42:31,765 --> 00:42:33,665
Understand, seal the deal.

628
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:36,301
- STD.
- STD, absolutely.

629
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,902
Tell you what, why
don't you go out there

630
00:42:37,904 --> 00:42:39,770
and just make yourself
familiar with the inventory?

631
00:42:39,772 --> 00:42:41,306
Can you do that for me?

632
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,341
- Yeah.
- All right.

633
00:42:47,279 --> 00:42:49,781
Listen, I, um, I
hate to ask this but...

634
00:42:49,783 --> 00:42:53,083
No, no, what's
on your mind, Lindsey Lou?

635
00:42:53,085 --> 00:42:56,256
Well, exactly how much
money am I going to make?

636
00:42:57,357 --> 00:42:58,526
How much you want?

637
00:42:59,893 --> 00:43:02,225
No, seriously, it's just that

638
00:43:02,227 --> 00:43:03,895
I'm trying to save
up for this trip

639
00:43:03,897 --> 00:43:05,129
- that I'm going on...
- I understand.

640
00:43:05,131 --> 00:43:06,364
I'll tell you what.

641
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:07,234
You stick with me

642
00:43:08,768 --> 00:43:11,234
and I'll take you
anywhere you wanna go.

643
00:43:11,236 --> 00:43:13,605
The money will come, I promise.

644
00:43:13,607 --> 00:43:14,873
It'll come faster

645
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:18,012
than lightning chasing down a
jackalope on the barren plain.

646
00:43:21,915 --> 00:43:23,348
Okay, seriously,
you gotta stop

647
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,183
using lines from your show.

648
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,650
It's just very, uh...

649
00:43:26,652 --> 00:43:27,384
Sensual?

650
00:43:27,386 --> 00:43:28,685
Confusing.

651
00:43:28,687 --> 00:43:29,323
Hmm.

652
00:43:32,658 --> 00:43:36,296
I want you to embrace
your inner coyote.

653
00:43:37,163 --> 00:43:38,996
You know what I mean?

654
00:43:38,998 --> 00:43:40,100
Take down the buffalo.

655
00:43:43,303 --> 00:43:46,737
Again, I don't quite
know what you mean,

656
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:48,174
but it sounds really hot.

657
00:44:15,335 --> 00:44:16,268
What?

658
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,101
You wanna drive me
around blindfolded?

659
00:44:18,103 --> 00:44:20,341
Then I can try to see where
we are using my mind's eye?

660
00:44:24,944 --> 00:44:26,444
Psst!

661
00:44:26,446 --> 00:44:28,179
- Hi.
- Hi.

662
00:44:28,181 --> 00:44:31,415
It's Scoot from
the Mountain Shop.

663
00:44:31,417 --> 00:44:32,385
Yeah, yeah.

664
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:38,823
I'm just here doing
research for the climb.

665
00:44:38,825 --> 00:44:40,024
- Cool.
- Yeah.

666
00:44:40,026 --> 00:44:42,726
I'm just, I'm
here for story hour.

667
00:44:42,728 --> 00:44:44,261
Oh.

668
00:44:44,263 --> 00:44:46,032
They usually have a puppet
show and sometimes cookies.

669
00:44:50,937 --> 00:44:52,469
I'm here with my nephew.

670
00:44:52,471 --> 00:44:53,306
He's seven.

671
00:44:54,406 --> 00:44:55,406
- I'm just his ride.
- Right.

672
00:44:55,408 --> 00:44:58,176
I'm totally
not into puppet shows.

673
00:44:58,178 --> 00:45:00,812
- No.
- Oh, god, that's weird.

674
00:45:00,814 --> 00:45:03,884
Do you wanna come
down to the end here?

675
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:09,453
Hello.

676
00:45:09,455 --> 00:45:12,489
Say, not that I'm an
expert or anything,

677
00:45:12,491 --> 00:45:15,893
but I have done my
fair share of climbing.

678
00:45:15,895 --> 00:45:18,830
Maybe we could get
some coffee sometime

679
00:45:18,832 --> 00:45:21,000
and talk about climbing?

680
00:45:22,335 --> 00:45:26,804
Uh, yeah, I guess, sure.

681
00:45:26,806 --> 00:45:27,772
That's awesome.

682
00:45:27,774 --> 00:45:29,306
Shh!

683
00:45:29,308 --> 00:45:30,143
I'm so sorry.

684
00:45:35,748 --> 00:45:36,382
Yes!

685
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:45,823
Well, I think it is fantastic

686
00:45:45,825 --> 00:45:49,326
that you both got a job on
the same day, it's great.

687
00:45:49,328 --> 00:45:50,527
It's no big deal.

688
00:45:50,529 --> 00:45:51,964
Well,
I think it is.

689
00:45:53,799 --> 00:45:55,435
You know who else
would think it was?

690
00:45:57,069 --> 00:45:58,071
Dad.

691
00:45:59,372 --> 00:46:00,871
He would have
been really proud.

692
00:46:00,873 --> 00:46:01,709
He will be.

693
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:07,844
Remember when dad would come
home with all the presents?

694
00:46:07,846 --> 00:46:08,482
And stories?

695
00:46:10,015 --> 00:46:12,118
He always
thought of you kids.

696
00:46:13,786 --> 00:46:16,089
He said he'd bring me
home a bumper sticker.

697
00:46:17,022 --> 00:46:18,790
For what?

698
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:19,860
Your forehead?

699
00:46:33,872 --> 00:46:35,475
Can you find my dad or not?

700
00:46:43,582 --> 00:46:46,083
He knows the area your
father went missing.

701
00:46:46,085 --> 00:46:50,224
- Many people die there.
- He's not dead, just lost.

702
00:46:55,895 --> 00:46:57,194
He'll do it.

703
00:46:57,196 --> 00:46:58,297
No guarantee, though.

704
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,402
Well, maybe I
should shop around.

705
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:05,138
I need a guy who can
get the job done.

706
00:47:09,843 --> 00:47:11,074
He'll get the job done

707
00:47:11,076 --> 00:47:14,281
and wants you to know
it will come at a price.

708
00:47:16,248 --> 00:47:17,080
Yeah.

709
00:47:17,082 --> 00:47:18,384
2,000, cash.

710
00:47:20,886 --> 00:47:23,856
Fine, I'll add it to the bill.

711
00:47:26,893 --> 00:47:28,893
How do you find him?

712
00:47:28,895 --> 00:47:30,895
You don't look like
a mountain climber.

713
00:47:30,897 --> 00:47:33,563
Scott, the Mountain Shop.

714
00:47:33,565 --> 00:47:34,401
Scoot!

715
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,069
We just
can't leave him here.

716
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:40,504
He'll be fine.

717
00:47:40,506 --> 00:47:42,505
What if he gets
hungry or something?

718
00:47:42,507 --> 00:47:43,908
Well, he can go
get something to eat.

719
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:46,344
He's not a freakin'
Gremlin, Monty.

720
00:47:46,346 --> 00:47:48,446
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

721
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:50,450
Now look, we've gotta
get to work, okay?

722
00:47:52,317 --> 00:47:56,120
All right, fine, you can stay
here and I'll go to work.

723
00:47:56,122 --> 00:47:57,054
Okay.

724
00:47:57,056 --> 00:47:58,589
Just don't sit around all day.

725
00:47:58,591 --> 00:48:00,359
Bend spoons or something.

726
00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:11,301
Hey!

727
00:48:11,303 --> 00:48:12,303
What's the deal
with you and Jerry?

728
00:48:12,305 --> 00:48:13,603
Mind your own business.

729
00:48:13,605 --> 00:48:14,605
You keep prancing around here

730
00:48:14,607 --> 00:48:17,975
acting like you own the
place, it's my business.

731
00:48:17,977 --> 00:48:19,210
Jealous?

732
00:48:19,212 --> 00:48:20,478
Barely, you think
you're the first?

733
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,145
Whatever.

734
00:48:22,147 --> 00:48:23,647
The guy's a fraud.

735
00:48:23,649 --> 00:48:26,016
He had a local kids show,
now he's a car salesman,

736
00:48:26,018 --> 00:48:28,351
all right, the writing
is on the wall.

737
00:48:28,353 --> 00:48:31,288
Troy Thunderton was an Emmy
winning children's show, okay?

738
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:33,024
He taught values
and life lessons

739
00:48:33,026 --> 00:48:34,491
from his Native
American ancestors

740
00:48:34,493 --> 00:48:35,692
that you wouldn't even
begin to understand.

741
00:48:35,694 --> 00:48:37,527
The guy's from
El Paso, all right?

742
00:48:37,529 --> 00:48:39,198
He's about as native as Wallace.

743
00:48:40,332 --> 00:48:41,933
I give you two weeks.

744
00:48:41,935 --> 00:48:42,699
That's about as long
as the others lasted.

745
00:48:44,169 --> 00:48:45,338
Lindsey Lou
to the corral please.

746
00:48:51,176 --> 00:48:52,076
Hey.

747
00:48:52,078 --> 00:48:52,913
Ho.

748
00:48:57,149 --> 00:48:59,116
You're awfully quiet.

749
00:48:59,118 --> 00:48:59,953
Just thinking.

750
00:49:02,355 --> 00:49:04,721
Remember all those times
you rescued baby animals

751
00:49:04,723 --> 00:49:07,257
with Tornado, your
Indian sidekick

752
00:49:07,259 --> 00:49:09,997
and you'd bring them
back to your wigwam?

753
00:49:12,031 --> 00:49:16,003
Troy Thunderton broadcasted
from a custom studio pueblo,

754
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:17,905
not a wigwam.

755
00:49:19,105 --> 00:49:19,940
Right.

756
00:49:22,007 --> 00:49:24,007
I used to wish you'd
show up at my house

757
00:49:24,009 --> 00:49:25,243
when my dad was
gone on business,

758
00:49:25,245 --> 00:49:30,450
and bring us baby raccoons and
teach us how to make baskets

759
00:49:31,049 --> 00:49:32,218
and grow corn.

760
00:49:33,752 --> 00:49:34,955
It's not too late.

761
00:49:36,589 --> 00:49:40,060
There's always time
for lightning lessons.

762
00:49:41,259 --> 00:49:42,493
Listen, I need to
get to the auction

763
00:49:42,495 --> 00:49:43,728
and take a look
at some used cars.

764
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,696
You'll be all right here
all by your lonesome?

765
00:49:45,698 --> 00:49:47,364
Can't I tag along?

766
00:49:47,366 --> 00:49:48,665
Maybe we can get coffee?

767
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:50,970
You know what, I
got a better idea.

768
00:49:52,538 --> 00:49:55,242
What do you say we forget
this place and go to Mexico?

769
00:49:58,377 --> 00:49:59,412
Serious?

770
00:50:03,082 --> 00:50:05,750
All right, if you
make a car deal,

771
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:09,957
Igor here will take
mighty good care of ya.

772
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,692
Wait, what?

773
00:50:20,198 --> 00:50:21,031
Okay.

774
00:50:36,681 --> 00:50:37,718
Well, hello.

775
00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:41,021
And to you, ma'am.

776
00:50:42,254 --> 00:50:43,687
Milk.

777
00:50:43,689 --> 00:50:45,623
Kids drank it all.

778
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:46,589
Of course.

779
00:50:46,591 --> 00:50:47,994
Well, you know what they say.

780
00:50:49,328 --> 00:50:51,261
Milk does a body good.

781
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,332
Or something like that.

782
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,502
Walk you to your car?

783
00:50:57,569 --> 00:50:59,105
What a gentleman you are.

784
00:51:00,105 --> 00:51:02,008
Yes, ma'am.

785
00:51:11,616 --> 00:51:13,085
I got it on trade.

786
00:51:14,187 --> 00:51:16,223
You got STD
power, I like that.

787
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:19,792
Um, thanks.

788
00:51:37,442 --> 00:51:39,243
So, what did you do all day?

789
00:51:39,245 --> 00:51:41,145
We watched Criss
Angel episodes.

790
00:51:41,147 --> 00:51:42,346
And?

791
00:51:42,348 --> 00:51:43,848
I'm definitely gonna
need leather pants

792
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,520
and an awesome hairdo if
I ever want to go on TV.

793
00:51:49,522 --> 00:51:52,223
Oh, and I went to the library

794
00:51:52,225 --> 00:51:55,759
and I found all three seasons
of the Troy Thunderton show.

795
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:57,330
I thought we could
watch them tonight.

796
00:51:58,531 --> 00:52:02,569
No, I'm gonna watch
those later, alone.

797
00:52:12,578 --> 00:52:13,911
Howdy.

798
00:52:13,913 --> 00:52:15,478
Hi.

799
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,183
Uh, I wasn't expecting
you to stop by.

800
00:52:19,185 --> 00:52:20,484
Surprised?

801
00:52:20,486 --> 00:52:23,386
Yeah, I mean, I
would've changed

802
00:52:23,388 --> 00:52:26,190
and put on something
a little more fun.

803
00:52:26,192 --> 00:52:27,024
No one will be able to tell

804
00:52:27,026 --> 00:52:28,926
when you're
galloping on a horse.

805
00:52:28,928 --> 00:52:29,830
You look terrific.

806
00:52:30,997 --> 00:52:34,134
Well, there's the belle of
the ball, Miss Caroline Lou.

807
00:52:35,301 --> 00:52:37,902
- You look so handsome.
- You look gorgeous yourself.

808
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,837
Do you mind if we
stop for a coffee first?

809
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,274
We are completely out here
and I am running on no sleep.

810
00:52:43,276 --> 00:52:44,208
That sounds perfect.

811
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,210
I promise I won't
keep her out too late.

812
00:52:46,212 --> 00:52:48,212
She's been working so hard.

813
00:52:48,214 --> 00:52:49,779
Look how exhausted she is.

814
00:52:49,781 --> 00:52:52,248
Oh, I was thinking,
after coffee,

815
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,817
have you heard of that new
country bar that's opened up?

816
00:52:54,819 --> 00:52:56,319
Tumblin' Weed, I sure have.

817
00:52:56,321 --> 00:52:57,855
Well,
they have line dancing.

818
00:52:57,857 --> 00:52:59,255
Yeah, we can go there.

819
00:52:59,257 --> 00:53:00,958
I have my dancing shoes on.

820
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,462
All right, let's get.

821
00:53:05,464 --> 00:53:06,732
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

822
00:53:11,203 --> 00:53:12,471
Motherfucker.

823
00:53:28,221 --> 00:53:28,953
Have fun?

824
00:53:30,056 --> 00:53:32,755
Oh, you almost
gave me a heart attack.

825
00:53:32,757 --> 00:53:34,225
Good.

826
00:53:34,227 --> 00:53:35,993
Aren't you supposed
to work early?

827
00:53:35,995 --> 00:53:38,228
How could you do that to Dad?

828
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:38,862
Oh.

829
00:53:38,864 --> 00:53:39,996
You're still married.

830
00:53:39,998 --> 00:53:41,297
- That's adultery.
- Lindsey.

831
00:53:41,299 --> 00:53:43,466
Oh, come on.

832
00:53:43,468 --> 00:53:46,270
Oh, I gotta get
out of these Spanx.

833
00:53:46,272 --> 00:53:46,907
Why him?

834
00:53:48,373 --> 00:53:49,573
Jerry?

835
00:53:49,575 --> 00:53:52,375
He's such a nice
guy, you know that.

836
00:53:52,377 --> 00:53:53,810
He asked me out.

837
00:53:53,812 --> 00:53:54,745
You could have anyone you want

838
00:53:54,747 --> 00:53:56,312
and you choose the one person

839
00:53:56,314 --> 00:53:58,348
who takes an
interest in my life.

840
00:53:58,350 --> 00:53:59,382
What?

841
00:53:59,384 --> 00:54:01,351
Oh, honey, don't
flatter yourself.

842
00:54:01,353 --> 00:54:03,386
Besides, you're married.

843
00:54:03,388 --> 00:54:05,556
Speak for yourself.

844
00:54:05,558 --> 00:54:10,530
We went and had coffee
and then line dancing.

845
00:54:11,663 --> 00:54:12,962
And it was a lot
of fun.

846
00:54:12,964 --> 00:54:15,299
It was a lot of fun.

847
00:54:15,301 --> 00:54:17,636
Good night, darling.

848
00:54:22,475 --> 00:54:25,645
Step right
up, don't be shy.

849
00:54:29,381 --> 00:54:30,480
Everything all right?

850
00:54:30,482 --> 00:54:31,882
What do you think?

851
00:54:31,884 --> 00:54:33,317
I think you look about as mad

852
00:54:33,319 --> 00:54:35,386
as a mule chewing on bumblebees.

853
00:54:35,388 --> 00:54:37,353
Did I earn this?

854
00:54:37,355 --> 00:54:39,989
I threw a couple
spiffs in there for ya.

855
00:54:39,991 --> 00:54:40,826
You too.

856
00:54:42,361 --> 00:54:43,294
I told you I was
gonna take care of ya.

857
00:54:43,296 --> 00:54:45,498
You think I'd send
you home with nothing?

858
00:54:46,665 --> 00:54:48,598
C'mon, kid, let's
go eat an orange.

859
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,799
I don't like oranges.

860
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:52,069
Mm, you haven't had
one of my oranges.

861
00:54:52,071 --> 00:54:52,906
Okay.

862
00:54:59,312 --> 00:55:00,313
How's your mother?

863
00:55:01,547 --> 00:55:04,380
Her feet must be hurting
something awful after last night.

864
00:55:04,382 --> 00:55:07,618
The only thing she has is
a serious case of the skank.

865
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,022
Be careful, it's contagious.

866
00:55:10,355 --> 00:55:12,089
Is that how you
speak to your elders?

867
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:14,091
That's all you have to say?

868
00:55:14,093 --> 00:55:17,364
Look, I may have
retired from TV,

869
00:55:18,397 --> 00:55:20,496
but I'll never stop crusading

870
00:55:20,498 --> 00:55:23,335
to help other people find
what makes them their best.

871
00:55:24,102 --> 00:55:26,405
Your mother just needed
a bolt from above.

872
00:55:27,105 --> 00:55:28,908
You had no intention, did you?

873
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:31,745
Of what?

874
00:55:35,881 --> 00:55:38,984
Are you saying that
none of this was real?

875
00:55:45,825 --> 00:55:47,123
I've been in love with you

876
00:55:47,125 --> 00:55:49,062
since you were on a
cable access show.

877
00:55:50,395 --> 00:55:51,627
I may have been 10 years old

878
00:55:51,629 --> 00:55:53,065
but you made an
impression on me.

879
00:55:54,132 --> 00:55:55,701
It's time to grow up, Lindsey.

880
00:55:57,535 --> 00:55:59,902
Maybe take a lesson
from your mother.

881
00:55:59,904 --> 00:56:00,739
Never.

882
00:56:08,446 --> 00:56:09,315
Like the orange?

883
00:56:10,448 --> 00:56:11,483
Is it gluten free?

884
00:56:12,817 --> 00:56:14,051
I think so.

885
00:56:14,053 --> 00:56:14,951
It tastes weird.

886
00:56:14,953 --> 00:56:16,487
Tastes weird?

887
00:56:16,489 --> 00:56:17,824
Hey. How much was your check?

888
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:21,491
$500.

889
00:56:21,493 --> 00:56:22,426
Okay, good, me too.

890
00:56:22,428 --> 00:56:23,596
We need to save those, okay?

891
00:56:26,531 --> 00:56:29,833
But can't I keep
some for myself?

892
00:56:29,835 --> 00:56:30,670
No.

893
00:56:32,404 --> 00:56:35,172
But I wanted to get a
Troy Thunderton spray tan.

894
00:56:35,174 --> 00:56:36,409
No.

895
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:49,085
Hey, guys, I'm gonna
go have sushi with Jerry

896
00:56:49,087 --> 00:56:50,487
and then I'll be back.

897
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:51,591
You don't eat sushi.

898
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:54,991
It smells like a barn in here.

899
00:56:54,993 --> 00:56:57,096
Come on, I asked you
guys not to let the.

900
00:56:58,897 --> 00:57:00,531
He needs to go home.

901
00:57:00,533 --> 00:57:02,132
He's training me.

902
00:57:02,134 --> 00:57:05,701
Honey, I know it's been
really stressful lately,

903
00:57:05,703 --> 00:57:08,140
but that's no
excuse to act crazy.

904
00:57:09,174 --> 00:57:11,074
Have fun on your date.

905
00:57:11,076 --> 00:57:13,544
Thank you, I will,
and you know why?

906
00:57:13,546 --> 00:57:15,078
Because
you're selfish?

907
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,616
Ha, Lindsey Lou.

908
00:57:17,982 --> 00:57:20,183
Because it hasn't even
been a week since the funeral

909
00:57:20,185 --> 00:57:22,453
and you're already looking
for Dad's replacement?

910
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:24,221
Okay, watch your mouth.

911
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,022
No one can replace your father.

912
00:57:26,024 --> 00:57:28,458
You not even
100% sure he's gone

913
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:31,027
and that we have
the right ashes.

914
00:57:31,029 --> 00:57:32,529
If the funeral home
can't get it right

915
00:57:32,531 --> 00:57:34,230
what makes you think the
Chinese government did?

916
00:57:34,232 --> 00:57:36,466
Your father made a living

917
00:57:36,468 --> 00:57:39,169
leaving me home alone
for months on end.

918
00:57:39,171 --> 00:57:41,772
Do you think I ever got
a phone call from him

919
00:57:41,774 --> 00:57:45,174
when he was in Africa,
South America, anywhere?

920
00:57:45,176 --> 00:57:46,576
Whatever.

921
00:57:46,578 --> 00:57:47,743
And when he would come home,

922
00:57:47,745 --> 00:57:50,214
he would hole himself
up in his office

923
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:54,051
or do whatever his
children wanted.

924
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:54,984
Knock it off.

925
00:57:54,986 --> 00:57:56,219
So you miss your father

926
00:57:56,221 --> 00:57:57,890
after not seeing him
for three months.

927
00:57:59,091 --> 00:58:01,428
I haven't seen him
for over 20 years.

928
00:58:02,127 --> 00:58:03,694
I hardly saw anyone.

929
00:58:03,696 --> 00:58:06,466
So yes, I'm gonna go have lunch.

930
00:58:08,167 --> 00:58:09,799
Because what other
option do I have

931
00:58:09,801 --> 00:58:11,534
but, I don't know,
sit around here

932
00:58:11,536 --> 00:58:14,937
and pretend that he's
going to come home?

933
00:58:14,939 --> 00:58:16,675
Okay, perfect.

934
00:58:17,743 --> 00:58:19,775
While you're pretending
like he's alive,

935
00:58:19,777 --> 00:58:21,210
why don't you sit in your room

936
00:58:21,212 --> 00:58:24,917
and dress in black and
mourn like a normal person?

937
00:58:27,785 --> 00:58:29,087
Like a normal person?

938
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:35,995
Monty.

939
00:58:37,296 --> 00:58:38,531
Monty.

940
00:58:40,064 --> 00:58:40,899
Monty.

941
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,600
Monty, come on.

942
00:58:44,602 --> 00:58:46,569
Knock it off, just cool down.

943
00:58:46,571 --> 00:58:47,538
You're not going anywhere.

944
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,940
I'm 18, I can do what I want.

945
00:58:49,942 --> 00:58:52,042
I'll report you
for animal cruelty.

946
00:58:52,044 --> 00:58:53,243
And who's gonna feed the goat?

947
00:58:53,245 --> 00:58:54,578
You don't understand.

948
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,647
Yes, I do.

949
00:58:56,649 --> 00:58:58,080
Okay, she's acting
like a total slut

950
00:58:58,082 --> 00:59:00,886
and you know she's only doing
this because I like Jerry.

951
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,620
I never got to know Dad.

952
00:59:04,622 --> 00:59:05,958
Not like you and Liam did.

953
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:11,027
Look, I swear to God,
everything's gonna be different

954
00:59:11,029 --> 00:59:13,663
when he gets back,
Monty, I promise.

955
00:59:13,665 --> 00:59:14,297
Mom's right.

956
00:59:14,299 --> 00:59:15,667
Dad was never here.

957
00:59:16,335 --> 00:59:18,034
I was in school when Dad left,

958
00:59:18,036 --> 00:59:20,770
and I feel like he's just
gonna come back any day

959
00:59:20,772 --> 00:59:21,975
right through that door.

960
00:59:24,676 --> 00:59:27,546
Do you think Dad would be happy
if he were here right now?

961
00:59:29,614 --> 00:59:31,817
Well, he may be a little
upset about the goat.

962
00:59:40,926 --> 00:59:41,757
Hello?

963
00:59:41,759 --> 00:59:43,092
Hey, it's me.

964
00:59:43,094 --> 00:59:44,594
We're heading to the
airport right now,

965
00:59:44,596 --> 00:59:46,228
we're catching a red-eye

966
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:49,799
because I'm playing a last
minute festival in Sweden.

967
00:59:49,801 --> 00:59:52,636
Well, everything's
great over here.

968
00:59:52,638 --> 00:59:53,603
We got a goat.

969
00:59:53,605 --> 00:59:54,737
How's Mom?

970
00:59:54,739 --> 00:59:57,074
Oh, you know, dating.

971
00:59:57,076 --> 00:59:59,009
Huh, very funny.

972
00:59:59,011 --> 01:00:01,645
Look, just make sure
she's happy, all right,

973
01:00:01,647 --> 01:00:04,313
'cause this is, like, a
really tough time for her.

974
01:00:04,315 --> 01:00:07,783
Obviously.

975
01:00:07,785 --> 01:00:09,853
Well, she hung up on me.

976
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,987
Okay, you know what?

977
01:00:10,989 --> 01:00:15,158
You and, just
meditate or something.

978
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,159
But I really wanted you to
drive me around blindfolded

979
01:00:17,161 --> 01:00:18,997
- and then...
- Monty, just stop.

980
01:00:20,966 --> 01:00:23,100
Come on, let's go outside.

981
01:00:23,102 --> 01:00:24,971
I can't work in
this environment.

982
01:00:29,908 --> 01:00:30,743
Hey.

983
01:00:33,812 --> 01:00:36,379
Oh, hey, hey, ho, oh, ah,
hello, hello, hi, hello.

984
01:00:36,381 --> 01:00:39,716
Let's not point weapons.

985
01:00:39,718 --> 01:00:41,183
You okay?

986
01:00:41,185 --> 01:00:43,252
Sorry.

987
01:00:43,254 --> 01:00:44,687
It's a bad day.

988
01:00:44,689 --> 01:00:46,158
Need to blow off some steam?

989
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:52,328
I think
I'm gonna die.

990
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:53,663
No, no, no,
you're fine, you're fine.

991
01:00:53,665 --> 01:00:54,397
You've got this, okay?

992
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,998
- Just stay focused.
- Okay.

993
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,435
What are you gonna do
when you're on Everest

994
01:00:58,437 --> 01:01:00,073
and it's life or death?

995
01:01:01,707 --> 01:01:04,676
Sorry, uh, high stakes, high
stakes is what I meant to say.

996
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:07,844
Can you just help me down?

997
01:01:07,846 --> 01:01:09,011
No, no, no, hold on,
you got this, okay?

998
01:01:09,013 --> 01:01:10,716
You sure you don't wanna stay?

999
01:01:16,955 --> 01:01:18,120
Uh.

1000
01:01:18,122 --> 01:01:21,627
Um,
it's, uh, it's stuck.

1001
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:27,096
You can't tell
me that wasn't fun.

1002
01:01:27,098 --> 01:01:29,732
Tell me it helped a little.

1003
01:01:29,734 --> 01:01:30,969
Yeah, a little.

1004
01:01:32,404 --> 01:01:34,804
You combine this with
some real mountain hiking

1005
01:01:34,806 --> 01:01:36,908
and you'll be a pro in no time.

1006
01:01:38,843 --> 01:01:40,743
Well, I'm not
looking to win awards.

1007
01:01:40,745 --> 01:01:42,981
I just gotta find my dad.

1008
01:01:48,986 --> 01:01:49,821
Yeah.

1009
01:01:50,823 --> 01:01:51,658
Yeah.

1010
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:55,725
I mean, he's still out there,
they just haven't found him,

1011
01:01:55,727 --> 01:01:57,060
which is dumb.

1012
01:01:57,062 --> 01:01:58,895
I mean, considering
the technology

1013
01:01:58,897 --> 01:02:02,335
and whatever else it is
that they have out there.

1014
01:02:05,971 --> 01:02:06,572
Question.

1015
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,375
What are you doing tonight?

1016
01:02:11,143 --> 01:02:12,808
What, like, later?

1017
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:14,176
Yes.

1018
01:02:15,013 --> 01:02:15,848
Uh.

1019
01:02:17,415 --> 01:02:19,850
Um, nothing.

1020
01:02:19,852 --> 01:02:20,817
Perfect.

1021
01:02:20,819 --> 01:02:21,784
Meet me here at seven.

1022
01:02:21,786 --> 01:02:25,020
Oh, and I'm assuming
that you like Chinese?

1023
01:02:25,022 --> 01:02:26,422
People or food?

1024
01:02:26,424 --> 01:02:27,259
Ooh, both.

1025
01:02:39,036 --> 01:02:39,870
Lindsey,
it's Michael.

1026
01:02:39,872 --> 01:02:40,904
Call me back, please.

1027
01:02:40,906 --> 01:02:42,442
We've got unfinished business.

1028
01:02:46,944 --> 01:02:48,448
All right, you got any tens?

1029
01:02:49,848 --> 01:02:51,515
You're cheating me, you
ruble headed, son of a...

1030
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:53,453
Watch your mouth.

1031
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,988
A lady in the office.

1032
01:02:57,855 --> 01:02:59,357
Sorry about the
language, Lindsey.

1033
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:05,295
Lord, you look like you been
rode hard and hung up wet.

1034
01:03:05,297 --> 01:03:06,899
What's got your
feathers ruffled?

1035
01:03:08,232 --> 01:03:10,135
Can we go somewhere
private and talk?

1036
01:03:14,506 --> 01:03:17,540
Sure.

1037
01:03:17,542 --> 01:03:18,844
I know just the place.

1038
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:23,950
It's a shame they're corralled.

1039
01:03:25,884 --> 01:03:27,420
On the reservation,
they run free.

1040
01:03:29,221 --> 01:03:31,922
Let me guess, you
tame wild horses

1041
01:03:31,924 --> 01:03:34,794
and then use them to communicate
with your spirit guide.

1042
01:03:35,928 --> 01:03:37,830
I rescued them from
an animal hoarder.

1043
01:03:39,297 --> 01:03:40,132
Oh.

1044
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,871
Look, your mother's
definitely got my attention.

1045
01:03:46,571 --> 01:03:47,904
I don't want you to
get the wrong idea

1046
01:03:47,906 --> 01:03:49,873
about the other day.

1047
01:03:49,875 --> 01:03:52,107
When my dad gets back,
you're gonna be sorry.

1048
01:03:52,109 --> 01:03:53,512
I can take care of her, Linds.

1049
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:56,312
I can love her.

1050
01:03:56,314 --> 01:03:57,346
Ain't that what your
daddy would have wanted?

1051
01:03:57,348 --> 01:03:58,551
For her to be cared for?

1052
01:04:00,152 --> 01:04:01,884
You're serious?

1053
01:04:01,886 --> 01:04:02,888
Always am.

1054
01:04:04,589 --> 01:04:05,924
You totally played me.

1055
01:04:07,225 --> 01:04:10,359
And now you're trying
to screw my mom.

1056
01:04:10,361 --> 01:04:13,864
I thought Troy Thunderton
was about honor and respect.

1057
01:04:13,866 --> 01:04:16,600
Look, I don't play games,
all right, I don't have to.

1058
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:17,868
Troy Thunderton was a legend.

1059
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:19,335
I've got two Emmys,
remember that?

1060
01:04:19,337 --> 01:04:20,540
Oh, shut up.

1061
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,375
You had a shitty
regional kids show.

1062
01:04:26,477 --> 01:04:27,911
I wish I never met you.

1063
01:04:27,913 --> 01:04:30,045
Well, why don't
you wish in one hand

1064
01:04:30,047 --> 01:04:30,980
and spit in the other?

1065
01:04:30,982 --> 01:04:32,852
See which one fills up faster.

1066
01:04:34,051 --> 01:04:36,288
I'm in love and I
ain't going anywhere.

1067
01:04:37,622 --> 01:04:38,955
Lightning can strike twice.

1068
01:04:38,957 --> 01:04:40,656
My people got stories
to prove that.

1069
01:04:40,658 --> 01:04:42,292
Oh, shut up.

1070
01:04:42,294 --> 01:04:43,560
You're Irish.

1071
01:04:43,562 --> 01:04:45,431
I read you damn Wikipedia page.

1072
01:04:51,502 --> 01:04:52,669
So, Lindsey,

1073
01:04:52,671 --> 01:04:54,337
what exactly are
your financial goals?

1074
01:04:54,339 --> 01:04:57,109
I need about $10,000.

1075
01:04:59,277 --> 01:05:00,210
Did you know

1076
01:05:00,212 --> 01:05:01,280
that your account is overdrawn?

1077
01:05:02,314 --> 01:05:03,446
Wait, what?

1078
01:05:03,448 --> 01:05:05,584
No, there should be, like,
$8 in there or something.

1079
01:05:07,185 --> 01:05:09,188
Did you make a
purchase for $18.99?

1080
01:05:13,292 --> 01:05:14,960
Goat food, damn it.

1081
01:05:16,661 --> 01:05:21,031
Okay, okay, just take whatever
you need out of my deposit

1082
01:05:21,033 --> 01:05:22,531
and then, I don't know,

1083
01:05:22,533 --> 01:05:24,970
open up a line of credit
or something for the rest?

1084
01:05:30,942 --> 01:05:32,011
You know what?

1085
01:05:35,047 --> 01:05:36,946
Why don't we start here first?

1086
01:05:36,948 --> 01:05:38,415
There's some good stuff in there

1087
01:05:38,417 --> 01:05:39,886
and it's a really quick read.

1088
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:42,455
Oh.

1089
01:05:47,024 --> 01:05:48,393
And you might need those.

1090
01:05:49,962 --> 01:05:51,197
Would you like a receipt?

1091
01:06:03,007 --> 01:06:04,009
How's your hot mother?

1092
01:06:05,109 --> 01:06:06,011
Hot as hell.

1093
01:06:07,212 --> 01:06:09,679
It's nice to see your sense
of humor is still intact.

1094
01:06:09,681 --> 01:06:12,184
Which reminds me, Lindsey,
I need your spare keys.

1095
01:06:13,151 --> 01:06:15,018
I lost them.

1096
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:15,655
Lindsey.

1097
01:06:17,055 --> 01:06:18,620
I'm gonna add that
to your tab, okay?

1098
01:06:18,622 --> 01:06:19,656
I'm working on it.

1099
01:06:19,658 --> 01:06:20,593
Are you working?

1100
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:23,426
You finally got a job?

1101
01:06:23,428 --> 01:06:25,931
After three whole
years of doing squat?

1102
01:06:27,198 --> 01:06:28,431
I'm proud of you, Lindsey.

1103
01:06:28,433 --> 01:06:30,033
- Okay, knock it off.
- Is it a real job?

1104
01:06:30,035 --> 01:06:31,301
You know what?

1105
01:06:31,303 --> 01:06:32,768
I've had to help out
at the house a lot.

1106
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:34,737
My father didn't leave a
fat inheritance like yours.

1107
01:06:34,739 --> 01:06:37,540
Well, yeah, that's true.

1108
01:06:37,542 --> 01:06:38,444
- Classy.
- Okay.

1109
01:06:42,747 --> 01:06:43,682
I need $10,000.

1110
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:51,788
Okay, honestly, I need 11,641

1111
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:55,125
but I think I can make
things work with 10,000.

1112
01:06:55,127 --> 01:06:58,194
All right, 11,641,
that's better.

1113
01:06:58,196 --> 01:07:00,029
Open lines of
communication, please.

1114
01:07:00,031 --> 01:07:01,163
Let's be honest
with one another.

1115
01:07:01,165 --> 01:07:04,266
No, are you kidding me, no.

1116
01:07:04,268 --> 01:07:07,036
Michael, come on, I've
never asked you for anything.

1117
01:07:07,038 --> 01:07:09,075
Just give me this one thing.

1118
01:07:12,777 --> 01:07:15,547
I will, on one condition.

1119
01:07:25,489 --> 01:07:26,993
I want these signed.

1120
01:07:28,194 --> 01:07:30,826
My accountant says the sooner
the divorce is finalized,

1121
01:07:30,828 --> 01:07:32,631
the sooner I can cut my losses.

1122
01:07:34,698 --> 01:07:35,567
Lucky you.

1123
01:07:37,768 --> 01:07:40,402
I'm not even gonna ask
you what the money is for.

1124
01:07:40,404 --> 01:07:43,109
If you're in some kind
of trouble, I don't care.

1125
01:07:44,176 --> 01:07:46,375
Don't care.

1126
01:07:46,377 --> 01:07:48,210
It's not like that.

1127
01:07:48,212 --> 01:07:51,181
Uh-huh, and if
this is what it takes

1128
01:07:51,183 --> 01:07:52,752
for you to start a
new life without me,

1129
01:07:55,152 --> 01:07:56,122
I'm cool with that.

1130
01:08:00,859 --> 01:08:02,692
Michael,
this is only 5,500.

1131
01:08:02,694 --> 01:08:04,460
You bet it is.

1132
01:08:04,462 --> 01:08:07,596
I subtracted your half of
the expenses from that.

1133
01:08:07,598 --> 01:08:08,797
Like lost keys,

1134
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:12,301
a cell phone bill that is still
in my name for some reason

1135
01:08:12,303 --> 01:08:15,105
and has to be paid every month.

1136
01:08:15,107 --> 01:08:18,176
I'm not even counting your
half of the honeymoon.

1137
01:08:20,178 --> 01:08:22,212
You're ridiculous.

1138
01:08:22,214 --> 01:08:23,812
As far as I'm concerned,

1139
01:08:23,814 --> 01:08:25,647
this marriage never
even happened.

1140
01:08:25,649 --> 01:08:27,883
It's all just a write-off.

1141
01:08:27,885 --> 01:08:30,686
Aw, like law school
never happened?

1142
01:08:30,688 --> 01:08:32,789
I'm working
big cases Lindsey.

1143
01:08:32,791 --> 01:08:34,223
You're a court reporter.

1144
01:08:34,225 --> 01:08:34,794
No, I'm not.

1145
01:08:36,228 --> 01:08:37,529
I'm at a firm.

1146
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:41,463
Congratulations
on your internship.

1147
01:08:41,465 --> 01:08:44,167
Congratulations on your aah!

1148
01:08:44,169 --> 01:08:45,334
You know, I have
some advice for you.

1149
01:08:45,336 --> 01:08:46,569
I'm not taking advice

1150
01:08:46,571 --> 01:08:49,606
from somebody more
screwed up than me.

1151
01:08:56,614 --> 01:09:01,584
But if you wanted
to fool around,

1152
01:09:01,586 --> 01:09:04,154
I'd be happy to cut
you a bigger check.

1153
01:09:04,156 --> 01:09:06,923
Stop.

1154
01:09:06,925 --> 01:09:07,827
Stop.

1155
01:09:10,828 --> 01:09:14,864
The next time I see you,
I want these papers signed.

1156
01:09:14,866 --> 01:09:16,533
Right.

1157
01:09:16,535 --> 01:09:20,235
And get the rest of your
shit out of here, please.

1158
01:09:20,237 --> 01:09:21,905
I don't wanna have to
take it to Goodwill.

1159
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:22,842
Okay, okay, fine.

1160
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:31,584
I guess I'll just get the
rest of my stuff later.

1161
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:36,288
I hate leaving like this.

1162
01:09:57,442 --> 01:09:59,645
Planning on
doing some baking tonight?

1163
01:10:01,712 --> 01:10:02,547
Yeah.

1164
01:10:03,715 --> 01:10:05,451
Poison flavored anything.

1165
01:10:07,618 --> 01:10:08,821
Heavy on the deadly.

1166
01:10:11,855 --> 01:10:16,862
Sweetheart, I am not trying
to replace your father.

1167
01:10:17,729 --> 01:10:19,265
No one could ever replace him.

1168
01:10:21,599 --> 01:10:25,701
I'm just enjoying Jerry's
company, that's all.

1169
01:10:25,703 --> 01:10:26,938
We're having fun.

1170
01:10:28,672 --> 01:10:29,908
He's a sweet guy.

1171
01:10:33,377 --> 01:10:34,212
Great.

1172
01:10:35,479 --> 01:10:37,246
Here, enjoy.

1173
01:10:37,248 --> 01:10:38,481
We're all caught

1174
01:10:38,483 --> 01:10:40,486
between a rock and a
hard place now, honey.

1175
01:10:41,786 --> 01:10:43,522
Shit, rocks.

1176
01:10:54,733 --> 01:10:57,633
Hey, man, I don't
think she's coming.

1177
01:10:57,635 --> 01:10:59,901
Okay, I'll be down
in just a minute.

1178
01:10:59,903 --> 01:11:03,873
Do you want to take some
kung pao chicken with you?

1179
01:11:03,875 --> 01:11:05,877
I kinda have a lot of it.

1180
01:11:07,746 --> 01:11:08,811
Sure.

1181
01:12:00,631 --> 01:12:02,498
Are you like this all the time

1182
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,801
or you just save it for me?

1183
01:12:05,103 --> 01:12:06,335
Just because your
life hit rock-bottom

1184
01:12:06,337 --> 01:12:09,007
doesn't mean you gotta drag
the rest of us down with you.

1185
01:12:10,375 --> 01:12:13,345
You know, I think
I'll stay right here

1186
01:12:14,412 --> 01:12:16,445
and make your life miserable.

1187
01:12:16,447 --> 01:12:18,380
That's fine with me.

1188
01:12:18,382 --> 01:12:20,415
Ain't gonna keep me
from loving your mother.

1189
01:12:20,417 --> 01:12:22,785
I am going to squeeze
the life out of you

1190
01:12:22,787 --> 01:12:25,391
like a smelly sponge.

1191
01:12:27,658 --> 01:12:30,028
You can catch more
flies with sugar, Linds.

1192
01:12:31,395 --> 01:12:33,128
Why don't you just try
being nice for a change

1193
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:34,399
and see what happens?

1194
01:12:35,401 --> 01:12:37,533
Your mom deserves to be
with a man who loves her

1195
01:12:37,535 --> 01:12:40,406
just the way she is and
I intend to be that man.

1196
01:12:43,108 --> 01:12:45,775
The fact that you pretend
to be Native American

1197
01:12:45,777 --> 01:12:49,645
is really just arrogant.

1198
01:12:49,647 --> 01:12:51,649
People protest
this kind of stuff.

1199
01:12:55,153 --> 01:12:56,355
All right.

1200
01:13:14,572 --> 01:13:16,606
How much do you think we
could get for your computer?

1201
01:13:16,608 --> 01:13:18,074
To pay for for Sam?

1202
01:13:18,076 --> 01:13:19,008
Huh?

1203
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:20,112
My mentor, I named him Sam.

1204
01:13:21,779 --> 01:13:23,713
We could probably get a few
hundred bucks for my laptop.

1205
01:13:23,715 --> 01:13:26,015
And then maybe if we have
some more money left over...

1206
01:13:26,017 --> 01:13:28,086
Yeah, we can get something
for Mom, okay, whatever.

1207
01:13:29,487 --> 01:13:30,121
Okay.

1208
01:13:31,188 --> 01:13:33,455
So, how do we get more money?

1209
01:13:33,457 --> 01:13:37,727
Well, we used to swing by
the local homeless shelter,

1210
01:13:37,729 --> 01:13:39,462
get some transients,
put 'em in a van,

1211
01:13:39,464 --> 01:13:41,496
take 'em around all
the other dealerships.

1212
01:13:41,498 --> 01:13:43,432
Then they'd go and flush
out all the customers

1213
01:13:43,434 --> 01:13:45,000
like varmints out of the brush,

1214
01:13:45,002 --> 01:13:46,636
and they'd come
over here to our lot

1215
01:13:46,638 --> 01:13:47,872
just spend like crazy.

1216
01:13:49,206 --> 01:13:52,441
Or, you remember
those late night

1217
01:13:52,443 --> 01:13:54,075
lonely girls looking
to hook up commercials?

1218
01:13:54,077 --> 01:13:56,080
Monty, go do something
else right now.

1219
01:13:57,948 --> 01:14:01,683
Say anything to my brother
ever again and I swear to God,

1220
01:14:01,685 --> 01:14:04,186
I'll stab you in the
neck with a tampon.

1221
01:14:04,188 --> 01:14:08,393
Somebody needs one of Uncle
Wally's magic rum oranges.

1222
01:14:26,144 --> 01:14:29,512
Excuse me, is there
something I can help you with?

1223
01:14:29,514 --> 01:14:32,048
Uh, you know,
Scott was helping me.

1224
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:33,583
Is he around?

1225
01:14:33,585 --> 01:14:35,884
No, he called in sick today.

1226
01:14:35,886 --> 01:14:37,488
Oh, oh, okay.

1227
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:39,625
Yeah, he's never sick.

1228
01:14:49,934 --> 01:14:51,167
I really
feel I'm ready,

1229
01:14:51,169 --> 01:14:53,235
like I can use my
gift to help others.

1230
01:14:53,237 --> 01:14:54,669
Yeah?

1231
01:14:54,671 --> 01:14:55,670
What kind of feeling are
you getting about Dad?

1232
01:14:55,672 --> 01:14:57,940
- Oh, Lindsey, enough.
- Why?

1233
01:14:57,942 --> 01:15:00,575
Is it interrupting
your dating life?

1234
01:15:00,577 --> 01:15:01,878
If you don't like
it, you can leave.

1235
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,646
Monty, I need you
to take these boxes

1236
01:15:03,648 --> 01:15:04,914
to GoodWill tomorrow, okay?

1237
01:15:04,916 --> 01:15:07,953
It's just some old
clothes and stuff.

1238
01:15:13,257 --> 01:15:14,193
These are Dad's.

1239
01:15:15,593 --> 01:15:17,959
I am keeping things,
Lindsey, don't worry.

1240
01:15:17,961 --> 01:15:19,227
I just need to get rid of...

1241
01:15:19,229 --> 01:15:20,064
Get rid of Dad.

1242
01:15:24,301 --> 01:15:26,205
It's fine, I'll take
care of it myself.

1243
01:15:43,287 --> 01:15:45,954
And we're live with
Dr. Montgomery Lou

1244
01:15:45,956 --> 01:15:47,789
as he discusses
saving the world,

1245
01:15:47,791 --> 01:15:49,292
one remote village at a time.

1246
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:52,294
Dr. Lou, tell us about
your next adventure.

1247
01:15:52,296 --> 01:15:53,831
I'm trying to be serious.

1248
01:15:55,567 --> 01:15:57,999
Well, sounds
like I should film then.

1249
01:15:58,001 --> 01:15:59,237
If you're being serious.

1250
01:16:06,743 --> 01:16:10,748
I mean it,
this is the last time.

1251
01:16:12,584 --> 01:16:13,783
Your mother and I
love you very much,

1252
01:16:13,785 --> 01:16:16,151
but you're never going
to learn anything

1253
01:16:16,153 --> 01:16:18,290
if we don't stop doing this.

1254
01:16:20,724 --> 01:16:22,758
Why don't you
take me with you then?

1255
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,627
On your next adventure?

1256
01:16:24,629 --> 01:16:26,628
It'll be so much fun.

1257
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:27,629
I can be your assistant.

1258
01:16:27,631 --> 01:16:28,763
You wanna
go on my next adventure?

1259
01:16:28,765 --> 01:16:30,665
Mm-hmm.

1260
01:16:30,667 --> 01:16:33,802
What
if it's too dangerous?

1261
01:16:33,804 --> 01:16:36,638
I should
probably stay here then, huh?

1262
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,708
In case I have to
bail you out, right?

1263
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:40,610
Right.

1264
01:16:40,612 --> 01:16:42,712
What are you doing?

1265
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:54,326
Hey.

1266
01:16:55,859 --> 01:16:57,194
Hey.

1267
01:17:00,764 --> 01:17:03,000
Did you know Jerry
likes to go camping?

1268
01:17:06,737 --> 01:17:08,339
He said we could
all go to Wyoming.

1269
01:17:11,876 --> 01:17:14,377
He's got this cabin
up in Carbon County.

1270
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:16,180
He said we could all go fishing.

1271
01:17:21,085 --> 01:17:22,220
He's pretty cool.

1272
01:17:23,354 --> 01:17:28,660
I mean, not Dad cool, but
different cool, you know?

1273
01:17:29,426 --> 01:17:31,263
He's a total fake.

1274
01:17:35,399 --> 01:17:40,605
He said you're just upset
about Dad and you can't move on.

1275
01:17:41,205 --> 01:17:42,274
Can't move on?

1276
01:17:44,341 --> 01:17:45,775
Monty, I'm not gonna move on

1277
01:17:45,777 --> 01:17:48,614
until I have proof that
Dad is really gone.

1278
01:17:52,183 --> 01:17:54,417
Nobody can prove
that psychics are real

1279
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:59,625
but I believe because
I can feel it,

1280
01:18:02,426 --> 01:18:03,694
and that's proof.

1281
01:18:04,729 --> 01:18:06,398
I've got enough
proof right here.

1282
01:18:08,465 --> 01:18:12,468
It's good for you, but
your psychic abilities

1283
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:14,373
aren't helping us
bring Dad back.

1284
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:22,980
Jerry says that courage
is being scared to death

1285
01:18:23,915 --> 01:18:25,283
and saddling up anyway.

1286
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:29,321
Jerry said that?

1287
01:18:30,487 --> 01:18:32,156
Yeah, he's smart.

1288
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,395
And you believe that, Monty?

1289
01:18:41,965 --> 01:18:43,000
Okay.

1290
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:47,205
Mont, can I have a second?

1291
01:18:48,371 --> 01:18:49,206
Mm-hmm.

1292
01:19:20,904 --> 01:19:23,207
- I'm sorry I've been so...
- I know.

1293
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:29,715
I know.

1294
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:33,819
God, that's hideous.

1295
01:19:34,885 --> 01:19:36,087
Where'd you get it, Grandma?

1296
01:19:37,889 --> 01:19:38,790
Jerry gave it to me.

1297
01:19:54,805 --> 01:19:55,840
I'm lonely.

1298
01:19:58,542 --> 01:19:59,478
What about Dad?

1299
01:20:01,946 --> 01:20:03,047
What about him?

1300
01:20:04,514 --> 01:20:06,517
He traveled the world.

1301
01:20:07,585 --> 01:20:09,051
And where was I?

1302
01:20:09,053 --> 01:20:13,021
I was here being a
mom, being a wife.

1303
01:20:13,023 --> 01:20:16,057
And I never
complained, not once,

1304
01:20:16,059 --> 01:20:20,529
because he promised
me when he retired,

1305
01:20:20,531 --> 01:20:25,200
we would travel the world,
see places, do things,

1306
01:20:25,202 --> 01:20:27,205
meet people, live life.

1307
01:20:29,873 --> 01:20:33,010
I put my life on hold for
him and what do I have?

1308
01:20:37,547 --> 01:20:38,450
I'm alone.

1309
01:20:41,117 --> 01:20:43,485
And you would have seen
that, had you been around.

1310
01:20:43,487 --> 01:20:45,190
You didn't want me here.

1311
01:20:46,623 --> 01:20:47,425
What?

1312
01:20:48,326 --> 01:20:50,028
No, that's not true.

1313
01:20:51,095 --> 01:20:52,927
You left.

1314
01:20:52,929 --> 01:20:55,166
You didn't wanna be
part of this family.

1315
01:20:56,867 --> 01:21:00,304
Life does not stop when you
walk out the door, Lindsey.

1316
01:21:03,241 --> 01:21:06,077
After all this time you still
think it's all about you.

1317
01:21:24,895 --> 01:21:26,398
Lindsey, you up yet?

1318
01:21:32,103 --> 01:21:32,938
Lindsey.

1319
01:21:36,006 --> 01:21:36,841
Lindsey.

1320
01:21:37,908 --> 01:21:39,674
- It happened.
- What?

1321
01:21:39,676 --> 01:21:41,677
The community college
is offering a class

1322
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:43,478
on paranormal studies.

1323
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,916
I think I'm going to college.

1324
01:21:47,018 --> 01:21:48,417
Where's Sam?

1325
01:21:48,419 --> 01:21:49,554
Uh, he left.

1326
01:21:50,921 --> 01:21:52,687
Left like he went
to go get coffee,

1327
01:21:52,689 --> 01:21:56,025
or to walk the goat left,
or like he left left?

1328
01:21:56,027 --> 01:21:57,993
Now I can go
to an accredited school

1329
01:21:57,995 --> 01:22:00,029
with real professors
who specialize...

1330
01:22:00,031 --> 01:22:01,664
Where did Sam go?

1331
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:03,368
He never really talked.

1332
01:22:04,568 --> 01:22:06,371
The bank, maybe,
to cash his check?

1333
01:22:09,674 --> 01:22:10,507
What check?

1334
01:22:12,108 --> 01:22:14,509
I didn't wanna wake you
up, so I wrote him a check.

1335
01:22:14,511 --> 01:22:17,478
But, man, Sam is not cheap.

1336
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,013
You could buy a
really fancy aquarium

1337
01:22:19,015 --> 01:22:20,449
with that kinda money.

1338
01:22:20,451 --> 01:22:24,085
Okay, so you what,
you wrote him for what,

1339
01:22:24,087 --> 01:22:25,721
- for everything, for all of it?
- Well, not everything,

1340
01:22:25,723 --> 01:22:26,955
But most of it.

1341
01:22:26,957 --> 01:22:27,789
Why, what's wrong?

1342
01:22:27,791 --> 01:22:30,292
That money wasn't
for Sam or you.

1343
01:22:30,294 --> 01:22:32,061
Yeah, to
help me become psychic.

1344
01:22:32,063 --> 01:22:33,494
No, it was to bring Dad home.

1345
01:22:33,496 --> 01:22:34,762
What?

1346
01:22:34,764 --> 01:22:39,034
Yes, I had plane tickets and
tents and climbing equipment,

1347
01:22:39,036 --> 01:22:41,669
and Sam knew Everest like
the back of his hand.

1348
01:22:41,671 --> 01:22:43,539
You lied to me?

1349
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:45,341
Monty, just listen

1350
01:22:45,343 --> 01:22:47,743
Okay, come on, even
you said Dad was alive,

1351
01:22:47,745 --> 01:22:49,610
that you heard him, right?

1352
01:22:49,612 --> 01:22:52,681
And what about all that
stuff about good feelings?

1353
01:22:52,683 --> 01:22:54,083
You used me!

1354
01:22:54,085 --> 01:22:56,084
I took a vow to only
use my powers for good.

1355
01:22:56,086 --> 01:22:57,753
Oh, shut up,
you're not psychic!

1356
01:22:57,755 --> 01:22:59,187
Cool it, guys.

1357
01:22:59,189 --> 01:23:00,722
Jerry's coming over.

1358
01:23:00,724 --> 01:23:03,325
Oh, great, this day
keeps getting worse.

1359
01:23:03,327 --> 01:23:06,094
Good, I like Jerry, I can't
wait for him to come over.

1360
01:23:06,096 --> 01:23:07,996
Why, because
he's Troy Thunderton?

1361
01:23:07,998 --> 01:23:09,630
You're the only one who
has a problem with him.

1362
01:23:09,632 --> 01:23:10,766
He's a loser!

1363
01:23:10,768 --> 01:23:12,534
Well, that loser is my guest.

1364
01:23:12,536 --> 01:23:14,436
And can you get that goat
out of the house, please?

1365
01:23:14,438 --> 01:23:16,137
You know, if Dad
was here, he'd let you have it.

1366
01:23:16,139 --> 01:23:17,505
You wanna hear
a psychic vision?

1367
01:23:17,507 --> 01:23:19,173
You and Michael don't
live happily ever after,

1368
01:23:19,175 --> 01:23:20,642
you work a crappy job,

1369
01:23:20,644 --> 01:23:23,544
and you live by yourself with
a bunch of cats, the end!

1370
01:23:23,546 --> 01:23:25,146
And you get really fat.

1371
01:23:25,148 --> 01:23:27,048
You're such a fake!

1372
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:27,682
And you know what else?

1373
01:23:27,684 --> 01:23:28,683
Jerry makes Mom happy.

1374
01:23:28,685 --> 01:23:30,619
At least he comes around
more than Dad ever did.

1375
01:23:30,621 --> 01:23:31,489
Shut up!

1376
01:23:32,723 --> 01:23:34,056
You wanna know why
Michael really kicked you out?

1377
01:23:34,058 --> 01:23:35,257
He never kicked me out.

1378
01:23:35,259 --> 01:23:37,058
Oh, yeah, so that's why
you've been living in your car

1379
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:38,360
for the past two weeks?

1380
01:23:38,362 --> 01:23:40,361
Everyone knows, we've just
been trying to be nice!

1381
01:23:40,363 --> 01:23:42,597
- Bullshit!
- We knew.

1382
01:23:42,599 --> 01:23:44,098
Maybe our lives
are screwed up,

1383
01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:45,670
but at least we're
honest about it.

1384
01:23:47,071 --> 01:23:48,536
You act like you're the
only normal one around here

1385
01:23:48,538 --> 01:23:50,705
and you're the one that
needs the most help.

1386
01:23:50,707 --> 01:23:52,040
Monty.

1387
01:23:52,876 --> 01:23:55,511
We do not slam
doors in this house!

1388
01:23:57,281 --> 01:23:58,813
Dammit.

1389
01:23:58,815 --> 01:24:01,450
You lost my cousin,
not my problem, lady.

1390
01:24:01,452 --> 01:24:02,651
He stole my money.

1391
01:24:02,653 --> 01:24:04,119
Hey, you take it up with him.

1392
01:24:04,121 --> 01:24:06,687
You have a signed contract?

1393
01:24:06,689 --> 01:24:07,522
No.

1394
01:24:07,524 --> 01:24:08,790
Not my problem.

1395
01:24:08,792 --> 01:24:10,594
This is between you and him.

1396
01:24:12,563 --> 01:24:13,732
Maybe he's in Hawaii.

1397
01:24:15,366 --> 01:24:18,566
Why would he be in Hawaii?

1398
01:24:18,568 --> 01:24:20,602
It's perfectly
beautiful there.

1399
01:24:20,604 --> 01:24:22,103
Okay.

1400
01:24:22,105 --> 01:24:24,173
You know, you either need
to give me my money back

1401
01:24:24,175 --> 01:24:25,641
or you tell me where he is.

1402
01:24:25,643 --> 01:24:27,843
You need to go now
or I'll call police.

1403
01:24:27,845 --> 01:24:30,281
Great, we can file a
missing persons report.

1404
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:47,599
You done?

1405
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:51,400
No, I'm shopping.

1406
01:24:51,402 --> 01:24:52,203
Mm.

1407
01:24:53,403 --> 01:24:55,773
Well, orange is a
lovely color on you.

1408
01:24:58,175 --> 01:24:59,842
I'm sorry if I creeped you out

1409
01:24:59,844 --> 01:25:03,111
and invited you for
Chinese food at a gym.

1410
01:25:03,113 --> 01:25:04,448
That's super douchey.

1411
01:25:06,149 --> 01:25:07,449
It's cool.

1412
01:25:07,451 --> 01:25:08,685
It's normal, right?

1413
01:25:09,886 --> 01:25:13,657
Can we go somewhere and talk?

1414
01:25:17,728 --> 01:25:20,098
I'm kinda going through
some stuff right now.

1415
01:25:22,332 --> 01:25:24,835
Okay, well, then
I'm coming in.

1416
01:25:26,237 --> 01:25:28,105
Like it or not, I'm coming in.

1417
01:25:44,255 --> 01:25:46,190
You never really planned
on going, did you?

1418
01:25:50,327 --> 01:25:51,162
I did.

1419
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:57,836
But my Sherpa ran off, and
my brother's been no help,

1420
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:03,408
and there's no one
else to support me.

1421
01:26:05,376 --> 01:26:08,346
I mean, besides you.

1422
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:14,452
You know, I knew your dad.

1423
01:26:16,420 --> 01:26:18,853
He used to come in
here all the time

1424
01:26:18,855 --> 01:26:21,126
and buy a bunch of stuff.

1425
01:26:23,227 --> 01:26:23,862
Yeah.

1426
01:26:26,563 --> 01:26:28,232
I can't wait until
he comes home.

1427
01:26:32,236 --> 01:26:32,871
What if he doesn't?

1428
01:26:35,973 --> 01:26:39,644
It's, like, really rough
out there, Lindsey.

1429
01:26:43,279 --> 01:26:43,915
He will.

1430
01:26:46,282 --> 01:26:47,285
You don't know my dad.

1431
01:26:54,892 --> 01:26:55,827
I hope he does.

1432
01:27:08,471 --> 01:27:09,570
Hey, it's me.

1433
01:27:09,572 --> 01:27:10,874
Hey, Liam, how's Sweden?

1434
01:27:23,687 --> 01:27:25,920
The search efforts for
the remaining two climbers

1435
01:27:25,922 --> 01:27:27,823
from last month's
devastating avalanche

1436
01:27:27,825 --> 01:27:29,391
has come to an end.

1437
01:27:29,393 --> 01:27:31,860
The bodies of two
American geologists

1438
01:27:31,862 --> 01:27:33,861
have been properly identified

1439
01:27:33,863 --> 01:27:36,698
as Mitch Connor
and Montgomery Lou.

1440
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:38,834
Earlier weather conditions
hampered the search

1441
01:27:38,836 --> 01:27:40,535
for the missing climbers.

1442
01:27:40,537 --> 01:27:42,704
Unconfirmed reports
of Lou and Connor

1443
01:27:42,706 --> 01:27:45,641
being found at lower
elevations led to confusion,

1444
01:27:45,643 --> 01:27:49,011
as the locals carried out
traditional cremation ceremonies.

1445
01:29:17,867 --> 01:29:19,101
Monty, I'm
sure you already knew

1446
01:29:19,103 --> 01:29:20,069
I'd be giving you this.

1447
01:29:20,071 --> 01:29:23,408
Go to school, develop
your gift, Lindsey.

1448
01:30:40,050 --> 01:30:42,450
Can I help you?

1449
01:30:46,689 --> 01:30:48,522
Lindsey.

1450
01:30:48,524 --> 01:30:49,426
Double check.

1451
01:30:54,497 --> 01:30:55,500
We're good.

1452
01:30:57,835 --> 01:30:59,534
You don't need to do that.

1453
01:30:59,536 --> 01:31:00,171
You, Lindsey.

1454
01:31:03,474 --> 01:31:04,075
Really?

1455
01:31:08,612 --> 01:31:13,584
Don't slam the...

1456
01:33:26,916 --> 01:33:28,283
I'll get it.

1457
01:33:32,656 --> 01:33:33,855
Hello.

1458
01:33:33,857 --> 01:33:34,692
Hey.

1459
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:38,258
I just, um, wanted to
see if Mom is around?

1460
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:39,095
Come in.

1461
01:33:42,131 --> 01:33:43,397
Oh, hey, Lindsey.

1462
01:33:43,399 --> 01:33:44,466
- Hi.
- Hi.

1463
01:33:44,468 --> 01:33:46,968
We were just talking
about your big promotion.

1464
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:50,405
Oh, yeah, uh, now they
let me use the cash register

1465
01:33:50,407 --> 01:33:53,040
and wash the dishes.

1466
01:33:53,042 --> 01:33:53,975
Grab a plate in the kitchen.

1467
01:33:53,977 --> 01:33:55,179
We saved you a seat.

1468
01:33:56,647 --> 01:33:58,312
Oh, that's okay,
I already ate.

1469
01:33:58,314 --> 01:34:00,315
I just wanted to say hi.

1470
01:34:00,317 --> 01:34:01,749
No, come on, don't be silly.

1471
01:34:01,751 --> 01:34:03,687
We have so much
food, grab a plate.

1472
01:34:06,422 --> 01:34:07,692
And some ketchup.

1473
01:34:18,669 --> 01:34:20,837
Figured we might
be seeing more of you.

1474
01:34:23,773 --> 01:34:24,608
Been busy.

1475
01:34:25,274 --> 01:34:27,174
Work, you know?

1476
01:34:27,176 --> 01:34:30,445
You've been avoiding me
and your mom like the plague.

1477
01:34:30,447 --> 01:34:31,282
Kinda.

1478
01:34:33,849 --> 01:34:36,086
Your daddy would have
been proud of you, Lindsey.

1479
01:34:37,787 --> 01:34:38,723
I know your mom is.

1480
01:34:41,992 --> 01:34:43,892
You're building a cumulus.

1481
01:34:43,894 --> 01:34:44,729
Hmm?

1482
01:34:45,961 --> 01:34:46,795
A thunderhead.

1483
01:34:48,698 --> 01:34:50,367
Your lightning will
strike, trust me.

1484
01:35:12,322 --> 01:35:13,987
We got rid of the goat.

1485
01:35:13,989 --> 01:35:16,160
He ate Mom's checkbook
and her good towels.

1486
01:35:17,193 --> 01:35:18,826
Figures.

1487
01:35:18,828 --> 01:35:20,762
How's Harvey and Kenny?

1488
01:35:20,764 --> 01:35:22,731
- They're pretty good.
- Yeah?

1489
01:35:58,001 --> 01:35:58,836
Hello?

1490
01:36:01,971 --> 01:36:03,907
Uh, yeah?

1491
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,079
- Uh.
- Everything cool?

1492
01:36:12,081 --> 01:36:15,517
Yeah, I just, um, I've gotta
go take care of something.

1493
01:36:15,519 --> 01:36:17,252
Can it
wait till after you eat?

1494
01:36:17,254 --> 01:36:18,485
Just
let her go, Carol.

1495
01:36:18,487 --> 01:36:20,521
But
you just got here.

1496
01:36:20,523 --> 01:36:22,859
I just gotta
wrap up some business.

1497
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:51,821
My old man gave me that
watch when I got my PhD.

1498
01:36:53,924 --> 01:36:54,825
That goes to Liam.

1499
01:37:02,299 --> 01:37:05,066
Now, these, I got for Monty.

1500
01:37:05,068 --> 01:37:07,004
That one, you know, obvious.

1501
01:37:09,104 --> 01:37:11,375
This one means
never stop learning.

1502
01:37:14,845 --> 01:37:15,513
He's a smart kid.

1503
01:37:17,413 --> 01:37:20,518
Sees the beauty in the things
that the rest of us miss.

1504
01:37:27,623 --> 01:37:29,492
That's for your mom.

1505
01:37:31,862 --> 01:37:33,998
It's a Tibetan prayer scarf.

1506
01:37:35,599 --> 01:37:37,535
Made me think of her.

1507
01:37:39,301 --> 01:37:40,804
She'll understand.

1508
01:37:47,911 --> 01:37:49,180
That's for you.

1509
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:58,255
I want you to wear that until
you find a guy so amazing

1510
01:38:01,657 --> 01:38:02,926
who loves you

1511
01:38:06,129 --> 01:38:08,098
the way you deserve it.

1512
01:38:16,005 --> 01:38:18,142
Why did you have to leave?

1513
01:38:23,145 --> 01:38:25,482
I'm never gonna leave you.

1514
01:38:27,917 --> 01:38:28,853
Not really.

1515
01:38:33,156 --> 01:38:34,257
I'm your dad.

1516
01:38:48,938 --> 01:38:49,973
Sorry.

1517
01:38:52,675 --> 01:38:53,910
Thank you.

1518
01:39:14,029 --> 01:39:15,465
- I
- love you, kiddo.

1519
01:39:19,068 --> 01:39:20,000
I love you, too.

1520
01:41:02,104 --> 01:41:03,607
Was it worth it?

1521
01:41:05,442 --> 01:41:08,011
So worth it.

1522
01:41:21,690 --> 01:41:23,527
We made it.

1523
01:42:47,646 --> 01:42:52,646
