1
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:59,420
Got a pebble in my shoe
and I can't seem...
Behind that bush...

2
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,059
I'm sorry for the short
delay. Our driver has it
all fixed.

3
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,496
And we'll be on our way.

4
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,831
You've made this trip
so enjoyable.

5
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:13,033
Well, it'll get
better, it'll get better.

6
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,035
Do you think we could
open a window? It's
awfully stuffy in here.

7
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:17,070
Oh, you can open 'em,
close 'em, whatever you like.

8
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:22,976
-Excuse me.
-Yes, ma'am?

9
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:25,513
I get woozy on the
back of the bus. I'd like
to change my seat.

10
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,415
Sure, sure, go ahead.

11
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,450
-Watch your step.
-Move along.

12
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:31,552
Do you think we'll see
any Jerusalem artichokes?

13
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:34,355
You've been roaming around.
We can't wander
off like that.

14
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:37,591
Now, there are snakes and
all sorts of animals,

15
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,027
Oh, thank you, Sister,
thank you.
Yes.

16
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:43,030
-I can feel...
-Oh, Sister Mary Rose.
Yes, Sister Rose Mary. Yes.

17
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,998
Uh-huh. Thank you.

18
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,637
Where, where did I go wrong?

19
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:54,575
All right, now everybody,
here we go again, finally.

20
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,677
I realize that it's warm,
it will cool off when,

21
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:57,745
Ah!

22
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:03,317
Somebody's knocking on
the door..

23
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:08,322
Stop the bus! Stop the
bus! Stop the bus!

24
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:17,164
-Oh!
-Watch your step, there.

25
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:20,268
It's the most interesting
thing that's happened on
the trip so far.

26
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:43,090
Okay, now that we have a
little time before our next
stop, I'd like to welcome you

27
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:48,161
to Pilgrimage Tours,
No-Frills Israel.
Where Moses led his

28
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,032
people to the Promised
Land and Christ grew into
manhood.

29
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:55,469
Since we'll be spending 15
days together here in the
Holy Land,

30
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:58,439
I'd like to take this time
to get better acquainted.

31
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:02,042
I'd like to start by
introducing our driver,
Mohammed.

32
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,011
I'm living in,
Mohammed!

33
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:11,218
I'd like all of you to turn
to the person next to you,

34
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:14,855
shake their hand,
and say to that person,

35
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,291
"Hello, neighbor."

36
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,393
-Hello...
-Hi, I'm Zoey
from Los Angeles.

37
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,263
-Oh. Los Angeles, eh?
-Yes.

38
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:29,937
Yeah, my girlfriend was
from Los Angeles. Gosh
she put me through hell.

39
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,106
Lisa and I were living
together at the time you
know.

40
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:37,244
Everything had always been
fantastic sexually and
suddenly,

41
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:40,381
Suddenly everything started
changing. You know, she
started changing.

42
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:43,250
Things weren't just the same
anymore, you know.

43
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,886
Turned out there was
another man in her life.

44
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,055
Actually, there was
another three men in her life.

45
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,258
Now, starting here in the
front row, I'd like each of

46
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:55,796
you to say your name
and tell us a little
something about yourself.

47
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:58,766
I'm Arthur Burns from
Miami Beach, Florida,
and I've come to

48
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:02,970
plant this fig tree in
honor of my grandmother
and grandfather.

49
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,238
Now there's a fine young man.

50
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,781
Uh, I'm Edgar Grant.

51
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:19,019
I have faith that the
healing waters at Bethesda
will cure my blindness.

52
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:27,661
-No way, Edgar.
-That's not very nice,
you know.

53
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:30,664
We're the Rutherford's.
Ralph, and my lovely wife
Florence.

54
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,233
We're celebrating our
50th wedding anniversary.

55
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,904
Well, I'd say that deserves
a round of applause. Huh?

56
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:42,510
What are you doing here?

57
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:47,681
Every time a relationship
of mine breaks up, I take
a vacation somewhere.

58
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,750
You must have been around
the world several times.

59
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:59,326
Listen, uh, maybe we
should start all over
again.

60
00:05:59,393 --> 00:06:02,996
Uh, I'm Harvey, Harvey Orkin.
I'm Professor of Language
Studies.

61
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,097
Hmm.

62
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,399
City College, New York,
New York.

63
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:07,568
Oh.

64
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:10,370
Oh, God, I had to, I had
to get out.

65
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:16,977
I had to have a change of
scenery. Just to take my
mind off that tramp Lisa.

66
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:22,950
God, I, I had to get
out. I had to, I had to
go somewhere.

67
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,785
But this isn't the place I'm
supposed to be in.

68
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:27,320
I mean, look at me, I'm not
even dressed for, for
the Holy Land.

69
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:33,226
You back there, why don't you
stand and, and share your
story with all of us.

70
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:37,197
Because of some stupid
mix up with the travel
agency,

71
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:41,569
Right now there's a Rabbi
Orkin living up in Paris while
I'm stuck on the stupid

72
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,504
tour of the Holy Land!

73
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:50,210
Okay. Well, our next
stop will be the Mount
of Temptation,

74
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:53,881
where Christ fasted for
40 days and 40 nights.

75
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,183
So we're going to have lunch
there, huh.

76
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:17,738
Oh, aren't we having fun now?

77
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:24,845
Be the third wise man.
Two dollars and you can
be the third wise man.

78
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,547
Only two dollars!

79
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:30,984
Careful now, watch your
step and figs.

80
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,755
All right, careful brother.

81
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,292
Oh, thank you.

82
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:43,497
-We really hit it off on
the bus, didn't' we?
-Uh-huh.

83
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:47,535
Listen, I'm sorry if I
embarrassed you, but
I'm, I'm a little, you know.

84
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,670
-Forget it. I understand.
-Okay.

85
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,618
Watch your step, watch
your step.

86
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:13,093
Oh, listen, I'm not so
good on heights.

87
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,495
Why don't we go and join
the others. I'll buy you
a new hat, for God sakes!

88
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:17,631
I didn't buy it 'cause
it's not functional.

89
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:21,001
-It happens to look great on
me. I want that hat.
-All right, uh...

90
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:23,937
Now let's just look
around here. It's got to
be here somewhere.

91
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:35,515
Hey, look at this!
I think I've found
something, come here.

92
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:49,930
My God, the stink. Hey!
Come on, here's your
hat. Let's go.

93
00:08:49,997 --> 00:08:51,965
Wait a minute.

94
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,539
Harvey, come here.
Look at this.

95
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:06,614
God!

96
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:09,817
That's a scroll!

97
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,486
That's a scroll. God!

98
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:19,359
It's in Aramaic. It's more
than 3,000 years old.

99
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:20,427
Can you read it?

100
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,565
Yes. Uh, I'm a language
professor, remember?

101
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,736
You know, maybe it was
fate that travel agent
made a mistake.

102
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,037
Humph.

103
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:36,276
And it came to pass that
a decree from Pharaoh
went out over the land

104
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:40,681
commanding all his people
that every male child
born of slaves shall be

105
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:42,449
put to the sword.

106
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,357
Farewell, my son.
Farewell.

107
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:17,217
Yes, you're, you're gonna have
all the things that I cannot
give you in your new home.

108
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:23,323
You're going to be so happy.
Yes, you're going bye-bye.

109
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:28,962
Say bye-bye. Say
bye-bye, Dada. Say
bye-bye Dada.

110
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,700
Here you go.

111
00:10:32,766 --> 00:10:37,070
You got everything
you need in here.
Here we go. Yes.

112
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,606
There you go.

113
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:45,946
Look what I got. Look
what I got. Charlie camel.
Yes, you remember him.

114
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:50,350
And your rattle.
What would you do without
your rattle, huh?

115
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,356
And some extra food in case
you get hungry. I know
how you love to eat.

116
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:58,892
Just like me.

117
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:12,973
Oh, no. No. I'm going to miss
you. Gonna miss you.

118
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,878
Thus the slave Hyssop
took a basket and cast it
adrift in the River Nile

119
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:22,049
with the hope that
Pharaoh's daughter would
discover the infant Herschel,

120
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,583
and raise him
as her own son.

121
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:55,515
-Do I look all right?
-You look gorgeous.

122
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:57,684
-Here, look.
-Oh, we better get up.

123
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:12,532
Oh.

124
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:18,205
You will be my son.
Your name will be...

125
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:23,110
Your name will be Moses,

126
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,879
because that is
like the word that means
"to draw out".

127
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,848
And I drew you out of
the water.

128
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:32,119
Shhh-shhh.
Forgive me, princess.

129
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:42,529
-Oh forgive me, Princess.
-How dare a slave set foot
on the Royal Bathing Float!

130
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,497
Be gone before I call
the guards!

131
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:47,901
No, no, no, no! I had a
dream that you were in
need of a slave.

132
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:53,040
Guardian to your newborn
child. That dream is surely a
sign that I am that guardian.

133
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,809
I would defend
this child with my life.

134
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:59,679
I would guard this child
with my life. I would,
I would.

135
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,818
Oh, you haven't
seen another ark around
here, have you?

136
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:09,756
-Guard!
-No, shhh. Uh, listen,
this'll take a second.

137
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:13,393
Same kind of ark, same colors,
brown instead of white.
You know what I mean?

138
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,897
-Same kind of kid,
too, but...
-Guard!

139
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,032
-Any of you girls seen
another ark around here?
-Guard!

140
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:22,936
Uh, no, no, I'm going.
I'm going. I'm going. I'm
going the same way I came in.

141
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,761
-Oh, father...
-I, I want
to play with it!

142
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,763
He shall be
raised as one of our own.

143
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:56,603
Now Hyssop could not bear
being parted from his
infant son,

144
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:00,173
so he sold himself
unto the House of
Senmut as a slave.

145
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:08,348
And so it came to pass
that Herschel grew
into his manhood

146
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:11,451
and entered
the family business as
was the custom.

147
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,829
God this is good.

148
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,467
-Slave!
-Here.

149
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:31,204
The Goddess of Fertility
is almost done. Tell the high
priest he can pick her up

150
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,041
before 5:00 p.m., otherwise
he has to pay our delivery
charge.

151
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,378
I'm so good at these,
you know, so good.

152
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:41,581
Do you think I overdo them?

153
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:45,152
-No.
-Huh? Mmmm.

154
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,355
I think I've got a real
feel for them.

155
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,623
More orders came in.

156
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,659
God, I can't believe how
busy we are.

157
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,563
Ah.

158
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,071
This is no life. God. Working
for an ungrateful family.

159
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:08,841
None of them have ever
lifted a mallet or a chisel
in their life.

160
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,345
They treat me, their own flesh
and blood, like garbage they
fished out of the river.

161
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,182
I'm going to leave
here one day.

162
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:21,854
I'm going to seek my way
out in the world, and there'll
be no stopping me.

163
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,023
Mmmm.

164
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:31,398
Five, six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven. I think one's
missing.

165
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,538
Ladies!

166
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,440
-Hello, Herschel.
-Hello, Herschel.

167
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:43,876
Listen, I told you not to come
until after hours. What is it?

168
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,812
Will you be needing us
today, Herschel?

169
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,680
No, not today.

170
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:50,117
You know we'll model for
you any time, Herschel.

171
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,186
Yeah, I, I know.

172
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:56,223
We can still come over
and play the game with
you, can't we, Herschel?

173
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:59,192
You remember, Herschel,
the game we play after
closing time.

174
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:02,562
I love it when you dress
up as Pharaoh and we're
summoned before you in chains!

175
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,465
And when we take your
scepter, and...

176
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:09,469
Uh, we'll have that in
stock probably in a
couple of weeks.

177
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:12,539
Uh, listen, we'll work
together really soon,
and, you know,

178
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,741
you girls will always be my
four favorites.

179
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,076
Thank you so much.

180
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,082
Scepter? Mmm-hmm.

181
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,229
What can I show you today?

182
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:37,297
Mmm,

183
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:39,732
something in Gods.

184
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,670
May I inquire whether... Oh.

185
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:47,840
Uh, is this, for that someone
special?

186
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,310
If so we, we do have gods that
make ideal presents.

187
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,279
And we do gift-wrap.

188
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,783
Is this for your husband
perhaps?

189
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:01,854
-I'm without husband.
-Well, uh, oh, dear...

190
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:03,056
I'm sorry.

191
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:07,594
No, no. I'm fine. Uhm...

192
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,465
I can think of no better
way of investing your
money than in a God.

193
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,002
I don't recall ever seeing you
before in Senmut and Sons.

194
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,805
I usually shop at Chock
Full of Gods.

195
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:23,376
Oh. Well, I think you'll
find that we at Senmut
and Sons have the

196
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:27,714
most reasonable prices in
town. And, and our gods
are returnable within 10

197
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,183
days of purchase if you
are dissatisfied.

198
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,588
If I may point out the perfect
choice, this is Hathor,
the great cow goddess.

199
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:39,392
The confidante of lovers
and lovely women.

200
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:44,764
I worship her myself.
And if I may say, it is you.

201
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,866
-What was the name?
-Herschel.

202
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,968
Odd name for a goddess.

203
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:53,373
Uh, no, sorry. I'm Herschel.
I am Herschel,
and this is Hathor.

204
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:55,942
And...

205
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:59,346
Oh, I'm called Zerelda.

206
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,249
Oh. That is a beautiful name.

207
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:05,318
Thank you.
What does she take?

208
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:08,388
-Take?
-As a sacrifice.

209
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:13,860
Oh. Sacrifice.
Uhm, let me check on it.

210
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:17,864
Slave.

211
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:24,171
-Here. Oh.
-Uhm, oh.

212
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:34,314
Virgins. Everything on that
side of the shop takes virgins
unless otherwise marked.

213
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:42,155
That, uh, it's,
the wrong color.

214
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:44,357
Uh, what, what, what, do
you have in mind?

215
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:47,527
Well, something
that, uh, won't clash
with our tent.

216
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:54,301
-Mmm.
-And, with this. I see
nothing here that would match.

217
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,768
But, I, I haven't shown
you everything yet.

218
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:58,538
Well, I, I really should
be virgin, going.

219
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:06,946
I must see you again!

220
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:24,697
I have heard tales of
fierce bandits who
plunder, rape and murder.

221
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:28,935
No bandits, however
fierce, would dare raise
a hand against us

222
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,238
while we're in the hand of the
most mighty gods.

223
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:44,817
Hey, hey, shouldn't you
be in chains?

224
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:48,187
Yes. Yes. And they are,
they're selling a new
chain this year.

225
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:50,290
That shackles you around the
neck and I thought...

226
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,425
Wrong. Your old one
will do just fine.

227
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,229
All the slaves are
wearing them around the
neck this year.

228
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,865
Listen, I cannot afford
new chains.

229
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:02,769
Do you have any idea
of the upkeep of a slave
in this day and age?

230
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,137
Oh, how embarrassing.
I'll be the only slave on
the block...

231
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:09,075
Hurry up. We've got all
these deliveries. You know
how I hate driving at night.

232
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,413
It isn't actually
diamonds or...

233
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,449
-What?
-Nothing.

234
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:17,684
-Or emeralds.
-Hmm?

235
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,052
Nothing.

236
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,121
-It's a reflection on you,
you know. I mean...
-What?

237
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,324
Nothing.

238
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:46,879
Now Herschel and the slave
Hyssop set out on their
appointed delivery rounds

239
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,916
as they did every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday.

240
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,193
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

241
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,865
Bandits! I told you there
would be bandits. But
would you listen?

242
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:08,067
Relax.

243
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:12,305
Rockslides are a
natural occurrence, Hyssop.

244
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:17,477
You must remember that it is
knowledge that will banish all
fear from the hearts of men.

245
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:21,381
Bandits!

246
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,750
-Our knives are sharp!
-Oh, didn't I tell you?

247
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:26,353
-Our arrows are straight.
-Back in the village,
did I tell you?

248
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:28,020
So stand and deliver
if you love life!

249
00:21:28,087 --> 00:21:30,657
What do you think they
are, tourists? Hmm, hmm?

250
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:35,595
Don't, don't, don't, don't
be afraid. I just remembered,
we're with them.

251
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:40,767
I am Herschel.
And I am traveling this road
with my slave Hyssop.

252
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:44,136
We are in graven images,
idolatry and the likes.

253
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:47,474
We are not worth robbing
unless you are devoutly
religious.

254
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,941
Throw down your
valuables.

255
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:50,109
Does that mean me?

256
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:51,177
Hardly.

257
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,650
When I give the word,
jump off the cart and
form the gods in a circle.

258
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:02,489
Here we are, you swine.

259
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:07,159
Any moment now the gods will
strike you jackals with
thunderbolts.

260
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:20,239
Yes, thunderbolts!
Any moment now.

261
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:31,751
This god...

262
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:34,954
This god I hold in the palm
of my hand, is he very strong?

263
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,559
That god is all-powerful
you witless ass.

264
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,028
All-powerful, is he?

265
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,564
All-powerful.

266
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,079
Where are the
thunderbolts?

267
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:16,195
Oh. No, you shouldn't
think I, what I was saying...

268
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:19,899
I was just having fun, you
know, I, when I really like
somebody I always tease them.

269
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:22,234
Do you have a family?

270
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:26,706
Yes. Yeah, absolutely.
And you're all, all invited
to dinner. Please come.

271
00:23:26,773 --> 00:23:29,275
Fine. I'm going to ransom you.

272
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:36,148
Send them a nose, or an ear.
We'll send it to your family
as proof of your capture.

273
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:38,785
Well, they'd probably
think it was only more
junk mail, you know.

274
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:41,020
Then we'll slay the two
of you right here and be
done with it.

275
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:45,558
Well, slaying is, is perfectly
all right with me, but who
would spread your fame?

276
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:48,895
Who would tell of your daring
robberies, your, your
terrible fierceness?

277
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:49,996
You got a point.

278
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,397
Oh, yes, yes I have.

279
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:52,665
-This one dies.
-Which one? Which one?
Which one?

280
00:23:52,732 --> 00:23:53,933
Free the salve.
Take the chains off.

281
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,035
Oh, no, no, no.
Slay me instead.

282
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:58,471
-Listen now, he has a point.
-Yes, yes. Take, take
off my ear.

283
00:23:58,538 --> 00:23:59,672
Listen to the voice of reason.

284
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:01,173
My nose. My leg.

285
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,241
-Silence!
-My toes?

286
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,681
All right.

287
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,218
But before we
end your master's life,

288
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:16,355
I promise you it'll be a
slow, extremely painful death.

289
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:19,225
He wasn't so bad, really.
I mean, a little chintzy
about chains, but...

290
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,260
This is your chance.

291
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:25,397
Take your vengeance on him
for all those years of
suffering and misery.

292
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,166
Well...

293
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:32,404
Now's your chance. Go on.
Enjoy it. Go on. Go, go, go.

294
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,241
Go on.

295
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:44,250
I have something really
important to tell you.

296
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,052
-Know that I am your...
-Shut up!

297
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:49,589
-I... Well, I just...
-Be gone. Go! Go!

298
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:50,890
-Yes, I just wanted to...
-Go!

299
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:52,191
-It won't take a second.
-Go!

300
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:57,163
Alone at last.

301
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:01,534
Hi. Lovely beard.

302
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,939
There must be some
explanation. God!

303
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:10,577
You'd of thought a thunderbolt
wasn't too much to ask for.

304
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:16,182
Maybe I made them wrong?
I've been an idol
maker for 20 years.

305
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:19,686
Just thought I could cut it
right now. Maybe I left
something out.

306
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,323
-Oh, Hyssop!
-Oh, you're alive.

307
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,795
-Oh, I can't believe it.
-For the moment.
Uh, do something!

308
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:32,799
This is hot. This is very hot.
How can you stand it
in there?

309
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:41,340
If I only had more spit.
Spit from over there.

310
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:49,448
I know, pull the stake up.
With all your strength.
Harder. Pull up. Pull.

311
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:54,053
Harder. That's it.
That's it, you've got it.

312
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,455
Now get out! Get out!

313
00:25:56,522 --> 00:26:00,693
Herschel's belief in his
gods were shattered and
he put them behind him

314
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,731
and chose now to believe
only in himself.

315
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:09,501
And so left the House of
Senmut and traveled unto
the city of Goshen,

316
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,570
seeking fame and fortune.

317
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:28,187
That's it.

318
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:44,003
That's the new, a new look
that I saw in, uhm, Carthage.

319
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:49,408
Uh, where most people
are wearing ankle boots,
you know.

320
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:53,646
And I thought it looked
rather nice. Your, uh, polish
is also very good for hair.

321
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:55,581
You're losing a lot
of ankle hair.

322
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:04,390
And, so he traveled unto
the palace, pushing his
way to fame and fortune.

323
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:15,935
I trust you've all heard
that Zalman is no longer
among the living.

324
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:17,937
Another victim of
Pharaoh's wrath?

325
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:19,438
Mmm.

326
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,874
That's the fourth
advisor he's put
to death this month.

327
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:24,043
Now we must choose a successor
among ourselves.

328
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:29,749
If only there were someone
who would incur his wrath
rather than us.

329
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:33,052
-Who?
-There must be someone.

330
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,088
I can't think of anyone.

331
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,192
Who would enter upon his
most perilous position.

332
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:42,962
Who could be so unsuspecting?

333
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,598
Who could be so stupid?

334
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,135
I ask you, where can we find
such an imbecile?

335
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:53,706
Oh, pardon me. I didn't
realize the room was
occupied.

336
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:59,245
The High Priests of the court
told the chambermaid that good
fortune smiled upon him

337
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:04,183
and thus proclaimed him
the new stargazer to Pharaoh.

338
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,653
-Slave?
-Yes, Master.

339
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:10,556
Is everything prepared?

340
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,558
The orchestra has arrived
and is tuning up.

341
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:18,731
I want everything to be
just perfect, you know?

342
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:26,372
This is my first orgy. Ha.

343
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:32,678
The most beautiful women.
And the highest officials in
Egypt shall be here tonight.

344
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:38,117
Is it your hope that the
girl, Zerelda, will be
among them?

345
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:43,655
Alas I have given up any
such hope. The stars have
assured me of success.

346
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:48,427
I've just time to douse myself
with some sweet smelling
herbs and spices.

347
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:51,697
I think a scent of lemon
will be perfect tonight.

348
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:58,838
Perhaps a touch of
grapefruit behind the ear?

349
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:01,273
Just, uh, just a touch.

350
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,112
-Thank you.
-Oh.

351
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,585
Sorry.

352
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:18,891
Nobody in Egypt will
smell better than me tonight.

353
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,965
Now, are you sure you
want me to put the place
cards on the floor?

354
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,135
You should have done this
hours ago. Do it now!

355
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:32,805
-As you wish.
-Now, go over the
festivities one more time.

356
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:35,474
Grapes at precisely 7:00 p.m.

357
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,509
Feasting and drunken
debauchery at 8:00 p.m.

358
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:41,280
Orgy promptly at 9:00 p.m.
and concluding at 11:00 p.m.

359
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:43,449
What did you forget?

360
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:46,853
Forget?

361
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:50,522
How can there be drunk
debauchery if you forget
the wine?

362
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,493
-Wine.
-Wine.

363
00:29:55,828 --> 00:30:00,699
Wine at 7:30 p.m.
Sorry. I'm sorry.

364
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:03,602
There they are now.

365
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:06,672
Let the orgy commence.

366
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:12,945
Ahhhh.

367
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:26,959
Herschel, the stargazer?

368
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:32,031
Oh, I'm Herschel,
the stargazer.

369
00:30:32,098 --> 00:30:34,766
Our Divine Pharaoh has
commanded your
presence at the front.

370
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,468
Uhm, the front?

371
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,640
I have a chariot waiting
outside. We leave at once.

372
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:46,112
I, I never go anywhere
near fronts. Uh, wars
are too loud for me.

373
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,679
I'm strictly a palace person.

374
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:50,349
Gather your things.
I shall await you
in the chariot.

375
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:52,885
Who are we at war with
this week?

376
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:57,023
I don't know. Uh, Hittites?
Or was it the Jebusites?
I never know.

377
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,091
They dress so much alike.

378
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,661
Pharaoh would never make
a move without me.

379
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:06,465
No doubt he wanted
the outcome foretold
of yet another battle.

380
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:10,736
Yes, that's it. Get the royal
horoscopes, my gauges,
my charts, everything.

381
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:14,073
Might as well send the
orchestra home. Oh.

382
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,875
My orgy was the flop
of the social season.

383
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:21,313
Girls.
There'll be other orgies.

384
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,215
Oh.

385
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:28,454
Will we ever see each
other again?

386
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,855
Oh, no tears, please.

387
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:32,658
I mean, I'm only going to
be gone two days at the most.

388
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,827
But the front.
Anything could happen.

389
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:41,900
This may be
the last moment we'll
ever share together.

390
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:46,038
Something I have kept
hidden these many years
will make you know the truth.

391
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:09,261
I placed you in this ark when
you were an infant.

392
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:12,398
And I drifted it
sown the Nile.

393
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:15,301
I'd hoped the Princess,
who was bathing in the river,
would discover it

394
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:18,037
and raise you as her own son,

395
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:19,938
but another baby was
there ahead of you.

396
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:23,175
Before I knew it, you
ended up with
the Senmut family.

397
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:26,112
I did want better for you.

398
00:32:28,814 --> 00:32:31,717
-This is true?
-It's the truth.

399
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:37,589
I, I may be sick.

400
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:39,958
Uh...

401
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:44,763
You are a slave.

402
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,299
Which means I am the son
of a slave.

403
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:49,535
Which means,

404
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:52,704
I, I am a slave.

405
00:32:56,675 --> 00:33:01,113
-Father!
-Son! Son.

406
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:05,417
You understand, of course,
that even though I've suddenly
found myself part of an

407
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:08,620
oppressed people, I, I
see no point in joining them.

408
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:13,292
Who would I know? I mean, I,
I wouldn't be very good at
slavery, anyway.

409
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:19,065
It's lifting mostly. I say we
leave well enough alone
and burn the ark.

410
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:20,699
No, no!

411
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,601
What do you think the
Pharaoh would say

412
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,871
if he discovered his
personal stargazer is
the son of a slave?

413
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:28,174
It's all I have of you
as a baby.

414
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,910
If anyone sees this ark,
you will have nothing
left of me as an adult.

415
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:49,295
Here.

416
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:14,720
Excuse me, excuse
me... Uhm, I'm getting
such a sore throat.

417
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,955
You know, I, I think
maybe I'm coming down
with something.

418
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:21,160
I'd hate to give the army the
flu, and you know, have them
miss out on the battle

419
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:24,563
just on account of me.
You know what I mean?

420
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:36,308
Oh, terrific.
I left my wallet behind.
Oh, great.

421
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,910
Uh, could you stop,
I left my wallet behind?

422
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:42,814
I, I'm sorry to inconvenience
you, but I left...

423
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:04,803
Herschel the stargazer.

424
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,273
What shall the watchword
be tonight, oh Divine Pharaoh?

425
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:08,340
Poo-poo!

426
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:10,409
So speaks Pharaoh.

427
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:16,915
Greetings, oh Divine One.

428
00:35:19,351 --> 00:35:21,687
I see someone's getting
a new toothy.

429
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:29,261
Congratulations on your
victory, oh, Divine One.

430
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:33,232
As our chariot approached
the encampment, I saw
the bodies of your enemy

431
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:35,867
littering the desert,
as I prophesied.

432
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:38,604
You may partake of my
fruits if you wish.

433
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,672
Oh, an honor, Divine One.

434
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,677
The ride was long and
hard and I'm famished.

435
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:48,414
There's been attempts
on my life.

436
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,981
I'm stunned, Divine One.

437
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:52,618
And you know what?
The fruit is often poisoned.

438
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:58,424
Poisoned?

439
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,827
The Royal Food Taster is
out at the moment.

440
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,330
Um, I could call him,
it's no trouble.

441
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:06,365
He's probably around
somewhere. Food Taster!

442
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:09,668
Taste this.

443
00:36:11,437 --> 00:36:13,672
-Food Taster!
-I said taste it.

444
00:36:39,798 --> 00:36:42,301
Is it the wish, is it
the wish of the Pharaoh

445
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:44,936
to risk the life

446
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:49,541
of his ablest advisor?

447
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:55,647
The dead you saw littering
the desert was my army, not
my enemy, Stargazer!

448
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:58,350
Enemy, Divine One.

449
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:03,689
Enemy! Now swallow all
you're holding in your mouth.

450
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:06,191
But I don't, what are
you talking about? I...

451
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:07,259
Swallow it!

452
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,632
New Scribe?

453
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:21,273
Well, I haven't seen you
before... Delicious.

454
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,276
You still live only
because it is the will
of the gods.

455
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,044
Uhm.

456
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:36,221
Last night I saw a star
enter the House of Egypt.

457
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:40,225
Counter attack at the break
of day and the stars forever
ordain your victory

458
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,093
over the Hittites.

459
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,698
If you indeed have read
the stars well, you
should feat nothing.

460
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:53,305
But if my army is once again
defeated, and you survive,
I will have your head.

461
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:56,975
So let it be written,
so let it be done.

462
00:37:58,677 --> 00:38:00,979
So speaks Pharaoh!

463
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:02,414
The little shit!

464
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:52,631
The Hittites! The Hittites
are just beyond the dunes.

465
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:54,065
The Hittites are
just beyond dunes.

466
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:56,134
The, eh...

467
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:00,906
You don't understand,
I'm Herschel, the Stargazer.

468
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:04,676
Excuse me, can I get through.
Excuse me, you don't
understand.

469
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:08,880
Poopoo! Poo, Poopoo,
that's the password.
Excuse me.

470
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:11,082
Stargazer coming through.

471
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,983
I bring you a message
from my king.

472
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,384
Speak!

473
00:39:46,452 --> 00:39:48,654
You have fought bravely,
but now all is lost.

474
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,090
You can still save yourself
and your men.

475
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:54,926
My king will give you safe
conduct home if you
surrender.

476
00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:00,131
Tell your king that we
who fought together will
die together!

477
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:01,533
Will somebody please shut
him up!

478
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,303
Our great king grants you
life. You have no hope.

479
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,138
In a few minutes you
shall all be dead.

480
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:10,241
Tell your king that we who die
for the glory of Pharaoh will
live forever.

481
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:14,312
Will you wait, wait,
wait, wait. Could we
just discuss this a moment.

482
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:18,316
Think of all the, uhm,
the wonderful things
we'll be giving up.

483
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:22,053
Uhm, sunsets, flowers,

484
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,524
the love of a good woman.
Uhm,

485
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:30,028
breathing. I've always been
particularly fond
of breathing.

486
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,997
Finish them with arrows.

487
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:36,067
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Uhm...

488
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,506
I really do have a lot of

489
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:44,810
loose ends back on the
Nile. Could we possibly
get together another day?

490
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,912
Uhm...

491
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:52,484
Oh, listen, I'll
leave you my name and
address, and, uh if,

492
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:55,453
if you ever find yourself in
the neighborhood with
no, with no place to go,

493
00:40:55,521 --> 00:41:01,493
please, drop by, march through
the place, burn it down to
the ground, pilage, rape...

494
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:08,667
-Finish them!
-Not right now, God you
stupid... Ohhh, my god!

495
00:41:08,734 --> 00:41:09,901
Ohhh!

496
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,342
Ugh!

497
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:21,980
Ugh, oh, oh. Oh, god!
And so it came to,

498
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:45,937
And so it came to pass that
Herschel fled from the wrath
of Pharaoh.

499
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:51,276
He was stripped of all rank
and worldly wealth,

500
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:55,213
and wandered into
the blistering wilderness.

501
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,085
A forsaken man, without
a country, without a hope.

502
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,702
-I'm sorry.
-I didn't...

503
00:42:22,207 --> 00:42:24,810
-Shadrach!
-Herschel?

504
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:30,315
Oh, god, I, I haven't
seen you...
I don't know when.

505
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:34,552
-Ah, it's been a long time.
-Oh, God, yes, too long.

506
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,222
Look at you.
You look terrific.

507
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:38,556
-Oh, no, no.
-Yes.

508
00:42:38,624 --> 00:42:40,225
You're the one that looks
good.

509
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,960
-Well, I feel good.
-How've you been?

510
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,330
Great. I mean, really,
you know, really great.

511
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,232
That's nice.

512
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:50,001
Very good. Things are really
coming together and,
and what's happening with you?

513
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:53,104
Well, nothing really.

514
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:54,472
-No?
-No.

515
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:56,842
Well, you know, it's up
and down...

516
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,744
One of those.

517
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:04,449
-Hills and valleys.
-Yeah. Oh dear.

518
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:08,053
-My God, it's getting late.
Listen, I, I gotta run, but...
-Oh, yeah.

519
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,188
-Really wonderful
seeing you.
-Ditto.

520
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:11,256
Yeah, yeah.

521
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:13,725
Let's have lunch.

522
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:15,060
I'll...

523
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:15,994
-Good.
-Okay.
Bye-bye.

524
00:43:16,061 --> 00:43:17,062
-Bye.
-Bye.

525
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:02,841
Strength to you, stranger.
I am Jethro of Midian.

526
00:44:02,908 --> 00:44:06,812
Oh. I am Herschel, son of
Hyssop.

527
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:09,881
Health, wealth and happiness
to you, Jethro of Midian, for
giving me shelter.

528
00:44:09,948 --> 00:44:11,416
I thank you.

529
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,920
-Let us break bread.
-Yes, please.

530
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:18,289
-Have you come far?
-From Egypt.

531
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:20,358
Across the desert on foot?

532
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:21,927
Mmm-hmm.

533
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,696
He-Who-Has-No-Name must
have guided your steps...

534
00:44:24,763 --> 00:44:28,834
Oh. He-Who-Has-No-Name?
Another god.

535
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,569
I have worshipped 2,000
gods in my time and not
one of them has been

536
00:44:31,636 --> 00:44:35,606
worth the sacrifice of a
field mouse, much less
what I paid on livestock.

537
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:41,046
If you're in need of a wife,
I'm father of seven daughters
and only one husband

538
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:44,482
among them.
Moses, the Egyptian
fellow with the stutter.

539
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:47,919
Said he was a prince or
something. Married my
daughter Zipporah.

540
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,822
Now he's prince of my flock.

541
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:57,628
Ha. Well, it must be
wonderful in your old age to
have your family around you.

542
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:02,968
Especially when you sit down
together and, uh, partake of
that delicious bread.

543
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:10,141
My daughters will now
entertain you. They're
all very talented.

544
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,924
Hey...

545
00:45:27,926 --> 00:45:31,696
Zerelda! Zerelda!

546
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:35,200
It's me, Herschel, from
the Idol Maker's Shop,
Senmut and Sons.

547
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:38,804
Yes, Herschel, from the
Idol Makers Shop.

548
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,738
I remember you.

549
00:45:40,806 --> 00:45:42,540
I have something of
yours, I have always
carried with me.

550
00:45:47,145 --> 00:45:48,146
For you.

551
00:45:54,652 --> 00:45:57,422
-Thank you.
-A pleasure.

552
00:45:57,488 --> 00:46:00,191
Leave us, my daughters.
And take all this broken
bread with you.

553
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:10,635
There is someone who can
warm my heart.

554
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:13,038
Your heart speaks louder
than your tongue.

555
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:18,309
I will wed Zerelda, if
she'll have me.

556
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:26,584
Herschel, you shall have
your own tent, on your
own piece of land.

557
00:46:26,651 --> 00:46:27,785
Ohhh.

558
00:46:27,853 --> 00:46:30,922
It is my wedding gift to
you and my daughter.

559
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:45,436
You got anything a bit
more, uhm, uh, rather than...

560
00:46:47,873 --> 00:46:51,509
Uh, yes, nice.
It's, it's perfect.

561
00:46:51,576 --> 00:46:54,679
Perfect. Thank you, oh,
Jethro of Midian.

562
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:06,925
-Where was I?
-Wedding night.

563
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:13,398
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. My
wedding night approaches
and I, I am not, uhm,

564
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,969
learned in the ways of
love making.

565
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:21,106
Love making.
Don't know how to do it.
Right.

566
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:24,409
-Right. I was wondering,
could you uhm...
-Help you?

567
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:27,378
-Please, let me know.
-Of course.

568
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:34,785
My little sister, when your
wedding night comes up, you
shall do in your husband's bed

569
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:39,424
what the sheep
do in the fields.

570
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:02,948
Oh God!

571
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:06,851
Zerelda?

572
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:11,322
Yes?

573
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,124
Arriving shortly.

574
00:48:20,698 --> 00:48:24,335
Jethro must have sand
on the brain to give
us this land!

575
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:25,937
Give me your hand.

576
00:48:33,979 --> 00:48:34,980
Zerelda, I love you.

577
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:37,748
Baaaaaa...

578
00:48:39,217 --> 00:48:40,318
What?

579
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:41,386
Baaaa!

580
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,321
Oh.

581
00:48:45,056 --> 00:48:47,558
Baaaaaa.

582
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:50,061
Now Herschel, help keep
the flock of Jethro

583
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:56,367
and dwelt under the
shadow of Sinai, the
mountain of the one true god.

584
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,974
-Baaaaa.
-Not now, Zerelda.

585
00:49:09,147 --> 00:49:12,717
-Uh, Herschel...
-Hmm?

586
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,620
Moses and Zipporah
invited us over for
dinner tonight.

587
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,389
Oh, can't we get out of it?

588
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,625
I already told them we'd
be there around sevenish.

589
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:23,128
Oh. Tell them I have
a headache.

590
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:25,463
Mmmm, we never go anywhere.

591
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:28,966
It's a desert! Now we
have the choice of your

592
00:49:29,034 --> 00:49:34,572
father's tent, Moses and
Zipporah's tent, or your
other sister's tents.

593
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:37,508
It doesn't make any
difference which tent we
go to anyway.

594
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:42,813
-All they talk about is sheep.
-Well, it's a family
business.

595
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:50,088
Well, I, somehow believe
that my life would have
greater purpose.

596
00:49:50,155 --> 00:49:54,092
Oh, Herschel, you have
the respect of the sheep.

597
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:58,096
But I'm not even entrusted
with the flock, just
the stragglers.

598
00:49:58,163 --> 00:49:59,664
Herschel!

599
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:03,334
There's Jethro on my back
again. Yeah, here, here.

600
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:08,773
Take those stragglers on
up the mountain so they can
be numbered with the flock.

601
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,741
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

602
00:50:10,808 --> 00:50:13,278
Do not keep Moses waiting.

603
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:27,192
Mmm. Oh, uh, we'll go
to Moses' and Zipporah's
tonight.

604
00:50:27,258 --> 00:50:28,626
Oh, great.

605
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:33,331
-Baaaa.
-Baaaa.

606
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,034
See you later.

607
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:46,711
Something burning?

608
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:48,779
Come no
nearer.

609
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:53,584
Huh? Ahem.
Is that you Moses?

610
00:50:56,121 --> 00:51:00,991
Uh, listen, I've, I've got
your sheep up here,
wherever you are.

611
00:51:03,294 --> 00:51:05,830
If it's all right with you,
I'll leave 'em here
and I'll, I'll go.

612
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:10,168
Uh, it's about time I started
down the mountain.

613
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:13,404
Take thy shoes
from off they feet.

614
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:19,009
For the ground on which thou
standest is holy ground.

615
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:25,015
I am the God of thy father,
the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac,

616
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:31,756
and the God of Jacob.
Come now, and I will send
thee unto Pharaoh,

617
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:36,093
that thou may
bringest forth my people
out of Egypt.

618
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,531
Me?

619
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:45,436
Now therefore, go!
And I will be with thee.

620
00:51:47,272 --> 00:51:49,274
You want me?

621
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:54,979
Me? Hey, you want me?

622
00:52:00,084 --> 00:52:06,891
Me? Oh, oh,
Zerelda, he wants me.

623
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:11,429
He wants me.

624
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:33,117
Zerelda!
Zerelda! Zerelda!

625
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:41,125
Zerelda! Zerelda!
Wait'll you hear.

626
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:43,261
Wait'll you hear what happened
on the mountain!

627
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:47,832
-Calm yourself.
-Everybody here, everybody,
everybody. Everybody here.

628
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:51,035
Why are you not on the
mountain tending my sheep?

629
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,338
-Because I quit.
-You quit?

630
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:55,406
-Yeah, I quit.
-Oh, Herschel, no!

631
00:52:55,473 --> 00:52:57,308
I've had it with sheep.

632
00:52:57,375 --> 00:53:02,179
I stood on holy ground.
Holy ground, Zerelda.

633
00:53:02,247 --> 00:53:05,450
Herschel, did you lose
good sandals?

634
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:09,086
He told me to take the
shoes from off my feet.

635
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:10,221
Who?

636
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:13,891
God.

637
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:19,597
The One true God
spoke to me on the mountain.

638
00:53:19,664 --> 00:53:24,201
I had the feeling that
was it! Oh, Herschel, did
you tell him I said hello?

639
00:53:26,304 --> 00:53:29,407
He, he, he did most of
the talking.

640
00:53:29,474 --> 00:53:32,543
How do you know it was
God? And not some
practical joker?

641
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:38,516
How did I know? I know
gods! Senmut and Sons! You
forget I was in the business.

642
00:53:40,585 --> 00:53:42,387
Forget about that.
What did he say?

643
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:44,355
He said...

644
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:48,426
That I should go into Egypt

645
00:53:48,493 --> 00:53:51,429
and deliver His people out
of bondage.

646
00:53:51,496 --> 00:53:53,731
Oh, Herschel.

647
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:56,534
Do you know how?

648
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:05,710
I was, chosen. God will
show me the way.

649
00:54:05,776 --> 00:54:10,581
Oh, He spoke like, like
thunder in the storm. I could
tell he was, he was used to

650
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:13,451
addressing large
groups of people. You
know, a very commanding voice.

651
00:54:13,518 --> 00:54:15,453
Really sure of himself.

652
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,755
- I am the...
- Wait a minute, wait.

653
00:54:17,822 --> 00:54:23,361
Hey, everybody, my husband
has just talked with God!
Come here. He's doing God now.

654
00:54:23,428 --> 00:54:29,467
He's doing God.
He just talked to him.
Okay, go ahead, do it.

655
00:54:29,534 --> 00:54:35,540
I am the God, thy father.
 I am the God of Abraham.

656
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:41,312
I'm, I am the...

657
00:54:41,379 --> 00:54:45,450
I, I, I, I'd have to hear him
a few more times before
I got him down pat.

658
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:46,817
But, you know, that's
the general idea.

659
00:54:46,884 --> 00:54:49,153
Never mind. It was wonderful.

660
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,290
Ha. Come, my wife,

661
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,193
we must begin our journey.

662
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:03,233
Thus Herschel took Zerelda and
set her upon her ass and began
the long journey into Egypt.

663
00:55:06,103 --> 00:55:13,077
Over hill and dale,
rivers and mountains.
Deserts and canyons.

664
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,437
Can you believe this, Zerelda?

665
00:55:39,504 --> 00:55:43,240
This is no everyday
occurrence, Zerelda.
This is the hand of God!

666
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:48,613
I parted the water!
We're talking miracles!

667
00:55:49,747 --> 00:55:53,217
Oh, Herschel, you're first!

668
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:57,722
Okay, I'm going to let the
water go, so pick up your fish
and we'll move upstream.

669
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:51,442
Alms! Alms! Alms!

670
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:59,049
Alms! Alms! Alms!

671
00:57:01,452 --> 00:57:04,054
Be of good cheer,
thou unfortunate wretch.

672
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:11,061
Thank you. Alms! Alms!
Alms! Alms!

673
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:16,066
With the power given to
me from above, I will
make you see again.

674
00:57:16,133 --> 00:57:20,971
Oh, no you won't, no.
No you won't. Alms! Alms!

675
00:57:21,038 --> 00:57:23,207
And walk again.

676
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:28,412
No. Please, sir, please,
sir, I beg you. There are
others in this town far

677
00:57:28,479 --> 00:57:33,884
more deserving than
my, myself. Beat it!
Alms!

678
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:37,354
We are all, we are all
children of the Lord and
equally deserving of His love.

679
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:39,724
I, I, I, I couldn't
agree with you more.

680
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,927
In fact, there's, there's a
leper colony not three
leagues from here.

681
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:44,361
Make a left at the first large
clump...

682
00:57:44,428 --> 00:57:47,264
Lift up thine eyes unto
the Lord and thou shalt see!

683
00:57:47,331 --> 00:57:53,003
Oh, oh, sir, please.
I am happy getting the pity
of my townspeople.

684
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:58,175
I get it from them sometimes
as much as twice a day.
Don't blow it. Alms! Alms!

685
00:57:58,242 --> 00:58:02,279
O Lord God, let Thy
healing power come
through my hands

686
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:04,549
and into the eyes of this
unfortunate man.

687
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:06,751
Thou shall see.

688
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:10,788
Owwww! What do you want
to do, blind me?

689
00:58:10,855 --> 00:58:13,390
Look, he who was bind can see.

690
00:58:13,457 --> 00:58:16,627
-It's a miracle.
-His second.

691
00:58:16,694 --> 00:58:20,565
Yes, it's a miracle,
but, ohhhhh, I'm still
lame as a duck.

692
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:23,233
-I am cripple, I shall
never walk.
-Rise up.

693
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,702
Please, believe me, you've
done enough, both of you.

694
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:25,803
You've been very fine, but...

695
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,905
-Alms! Alms!
-Rise up!

696
00:58:27,972 --> 00:58:30,641
No, I'm content to
grovel. I must grovel
down here. I cannot walk.

697
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:36,180
-Walk!
-I can't walk! I, I can walk.

698
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:39,249
Oh, look, he who was once
lame now can walk.

699
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:41,752
It's a miracle.
His third.

700
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:44,521
Beg no more.
Go praise the Lord.

701
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:53,197
Praise the Lord.
Keep the faith.

702
00:59:00,805 --> 00:59:02,472
Who are thou, stranger?

703
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,408
I'm Herschel, son of Hyssop.

704
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:05,576
Nice work.

705
00:59:05,643 --> 00:59:07,211
Well, it's the work of
the Lord.

706
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:08,312
On your way somewhere?

707
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,581
-Egypt.
-So soon?

708
00:59:10,648 --> 00:59:15,519
Ahh, well, if you must know,
I am delivering the children
of the Lord out of bondage.

709
00:59:15,586 --> 00:59:19,256
And He in His infinite
wisdom has guided you
here. Deliver us first!

710
00:59:19,323 --> 00:59:20,725
From what?

711
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:23,127
Amok! The biggest,
strongest, and most dreaded
of all the giants.

712
00:59:23,193 --> 00:59:27,898
He stands nine
cubits, just from the crotch
to the heel of the foot.

713
00:59:27,965 --> 00:59:33,203
That means, that means
that he's got a twelve
foot ins... Inseam.

714
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,972
-Oh, yes.
-Mmm-hmm.

715
00:59:36,373 --> 00:59:39,476
-You know his measurement.
-I am his tailor.

716
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:41,746
-Ahhhh.
-He has a tailor.

717
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:45,683
He may be a bloodthirsty
giant, but he does keep
up his appearance.

718
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:50,154
Always in fashion. He was
wearing open toe sandals
before it became the fad.

719
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:54,625
Chic or not, he is still
a giant and we want no
part of him! So could you?

720
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:56,126
-Could I what?
-Smite him!

721
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:58,262
Oh, yes!

722
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:02,166
Our town should be thriving.
Are we thriving? No!
All because of him!

723
01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:05,569
Ahhh, gather around me.
That's enough.

724
01:00:07,304 --> 01:00:13,811
Just because somebody is
taller than us, you, you
needn't wish him harm.

725
01:00:13,878 --> 01:00:16,714
We are all brothers in the
eyes of the Lord.

726
01:00:16,781 --> 01:00:19,817
Open your hearts, show him
kindness.

727
01:00:19,884 --> 01:00:22,286
Uh, you there.
What has Amok ever done
to you?

728
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:24,321
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

729
01:00:24,388 --> 01:00:26,891
But he squashed my
grandmother once.
It was horrible.

730
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,126
She was lying
on the ground, her eyes
were bulging out.

731
01:00:29,193 --> 01:00:31,662
He crushed my cousin
flatter than a matzo.

732
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:34,164
-He'd walk all over us if
you'd let him.
-Right.

733
01:00:34,231 --> 01:00:37,968
Oh, Herschel, I think,
uh, you should have a
chat with him.

734
01:00:38,803 --> 01:00:40,404
Indeed I should.

735
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:52,249
Hey, Shorty!

736
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:56,453
I come in the name of the One
True God, who will make me
victorious over you, Amok.

737
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:01,759
Oh! Ah!

738
01:01:01,826 --> 01:01:04,328
Oh, you didn't have to
hit him there, did you?

739
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:06,330
I was aiming, aiming
between his eyes.

740
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:08,532
You shouldn't have hit
him there!

741
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:13,470
Oh, false prophet!

742
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:20,845
And the angry giant
stepped heavily upon
the village.

743
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:24,514
And those among
the villagers, who were
not made flat, rose up

744
01:01:24,581 --> 01:01:30,120
against Herschel and
curse his name, and he
was sent into slavery.

745
01:01:48,973 --> 01:01:50,941
Ah, a little one.

746
01:01:52,877 --> 01:01:53,878
Come on.

747
01:01:56,781 --> 01:01:59,850
Greetings. I think
you're gonna like it here.

748
01:02:37,554 --> 01:02:40,190
Water, come here. Quick.

749
01:02:53,337 --> 01:02:54,404
What?

750
01:02:54,471 --> 01:02:57,875
Squashed foot.
Squashed foot.

751
01:02:58,408 --> 01:03:00,344
Washed foot?

752
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:03,080
You're on my...

753
01:03:03,147 --> 01:03:06,650
Do any of you, any of
you, uh, any of you
understand Ethiopian?

754
01:03:06,716 --> 01:03:11,488
Or Nubian? Now say,
say it slowly, I can't
understand you.

755
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:14,058
Rock...
Rock-k-k-k-k?

756
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,693
-Rock-e-e-e-e...
-Rock-e-e-e-e?

757
01:03:34,778 --> 01:03:36,113
Throw him in!

758
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:39,283
What? No, no, don't.

759
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:49,860
And behold, the Angel of
the Lord appeared unto
Herschel

760
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:53,830
in his hour of
darkness and a heavenly
light shined in the pit.

761
01:03:53,898 --> 01:03:57,167
-Hi. Hi.
-Oh, oh!

762
01:03:57,234 --> 01:04:00,004
I thought I was forsaken but,
but at last you've, you've
come bearing a message

763
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:01,238
from the Lord.

764
01:04:01,305 --> 01:04:03,974
Oh, no, no, no.
No, you're, you're
still forsaken.

765
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:07,611
But, you mean the Lord
didn't send you to, to
deliver me from the hands

766
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,712
of the Taskmaster?

767
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:10,480
No, no, no, as far
as I know, no.

768
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:14,418
Maybe I wasn't making
myself clear.

769
01:04:15,485 --> 01:04:18,855
I'm perishing here in
a salt mine.

770
01:04:18,923 --> 01:04:21,658
And making much too much
of it, if you ask me.

771
01:04:21,725 --> 01:04:27,431
Oh, listen, God spoke
to me on the mountain.

772
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:34,471
I am the God of thy Father.
 I am the God of Abraham.

773
01:04:37,407 --> 01:04:41,278
That, that's fantas...
That's uncanny.

774
01:04:41,345 --> 01:04:45,349
That is, you got, you
got him down pat.

775
01:04:45,415 --> 01:04:47,985
Well, I, I, I've been
working on it, you see.

776
01:04:48,052 --> 01:04:51,621
But I'm, I'm supposed to be
delivering His children out
of bondage in Egypt!

777
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:54,191
I'm sorry. Look, until I
have a signed document...

778
01:04:54,258 --> 01:04:56,393
Ahhh!

779
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,428
On you, with your name
on it, signed by somebody
in a very high position,

780
01:04:58,495 --> 01:05:00,497
I cannot lift one little
finger to help you out.
I'm sorry.

781
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:03,733
And since you won't have
a little drinky with me,
I guess I'll be on my way now.

782
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:05,635
Bye.

783
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:12,176
-Hey! What are
you, you can't do this.
-Oh, yes, I can.

784
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:13,944
-You can't!
-Please, where's my wife?

785
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:16,246
That's trouble, for you.

786
01:05:16,313 --> 01:05:20,084
As the Angel of the Lord
soared into the heavens.
He told Herschel to look

787
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:24,454
for his wife, in the
most, wicked of cities.

788
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:29,559
-Whoa, ho, ho, hold it.
-Is, is this the road to
the most wicked of cities?

789
01:05:29,626 --> 01:05:33,397
Shhh, shhh, shhh, shhh.
You don't know who's
around here.

790
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:35,465
-You never know
who's around.
-Oh, sorry.

791
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,802
All right, come on, get in.
Hurry up, get in.

792
01:05:42,506 --> 01:05:44,774
Just find a spot.

793
01:05:44,841 --> 01:05:48,078
But, uh, hey, hey, hey,
hey, all right, all
right, put, put that down.

794
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:53,750
Look, don't touch my fruit and
mind you don't quench your
thirst on my elixirs.

795
01:05:53,817 --> 01:05:56,686
That is not your everyday
produce back there.

796
01:05:56,753 --> 01:06:03,260
-Oh.
-Okay, move it, move it.
Get up, get up, get up!

797
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:13,637
Tell me about this most
wicked of cities.

798
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:15,105
-Sodom.
-Yeah, yeah.

799
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:19,109
They had fire, they had
brimstone. You name it,
they got it.

800
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:22,012
Oh, he gave
it to them good. Ha!

801
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,513
Ha-ha.

802
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:24,948
But you know people,
though, how they love
a party.

803
01:06:25,015 --> 01:06:27,084
-They built it right back.
-Yeah.

804
01:06:27,151 --> 01:06:30,920
They got it, uh, they got it
bigger, they got it more
wicked than they had before.

805
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,790
-Now they call
it New Sodom.
-New Sodom.

806
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,527
Get over there!

807
01:06:40,197 --> 01:06:44,968
Have you, uh...
Have you heard of my wife
Zerelda? I'm looking for her.

808
01:06:46,536 --> 01:06:48,105
-Zerelda?
-Mmm.

809
01:06:48,172 --> 01:06:54,778
Zerelda, Zerelda, Oh,
yeah, Zerelda. Mmm.

810
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:58,348
-Zerelda, you've, you've
heard of her?
-That depends.

811
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:04,954
-On what?
-Uhm, would you care to
buy a sundial?

812
01:07:08,192 --> 01:07:12,262
Uhm, I would love to,
but I, I have no money.

813
01:07:13,597 --> 01:07:16,032
-The same old song.
-Oh.

814
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:19,669
Yeah, I've seen her. She
has taken up with Amok,
the giant.

815
01:07:19,736 --> 01:07:21,705
-Amok, the giant?
-Yes.

816
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:23,006
-Oh, no!
-Yeah.

817
01:07:24,074 --> 01:07:25,775
-Amok, the giant?
-Yeah.

818
01:07:25,842 --> 01:07:26,843
Oh.

819
01:07:29,012 --> 01:07:31,181
How much longer is it?

820
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:33,917
I don't know. You'll have
to ask Zerelda that.

821
01:07:34,851 --> 01:07:36,720
I mean to New Sodom.

822
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:38,622
Oh, that's not far.

823
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:53,737
Love your hair.

824
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:55,872
What?

825
01:07:57,541 --> 01:08:01,911
I love the way the sun is
glistening through your hair.

826
01:08:03,713 --> 01:08:05,315
It's beautiful.

827
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,284
Ah!

828
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:30,340
I'm Herschel, son of
Hyssop, I, I wish to
enter your city.

829
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:32,842
No one passes without the
king's permission.

830
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:37,113
Unless you're one of those
eunuchs who'll be waiting
on his banquet this evening.

831
01:08:37,181 --> 01:08:39,449
Oh, open your gates.

832
01:08:39,516 --> 01:08:41,651
Hear ye! Hear ye!

833
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:45,422
There will be incestuous and
other unnatural acts
tonight at the Lodge of

834
01:08:45,489 --> 01:08:49,726
Good Fellowship! Bring
your own relatives!

835
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:29,866
Oh, yes. Oh, oh, more,
more. Oh, more, yes,
harder, harder.

836
01:09:29,933 --> 01:09:33,203
Oh, that's it. Oh, more, yes,
harder, harder.

837
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:36,673
Yes, oh, oh,
yes, love that. Oh, more,
harder, harder.

838
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:41,778
Maybe the three of us
could go to your room.

839
01:09:41,845 --> 01:09:42,912
You!

840
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,081
See you later.

841
01:10:03,066 --> 01:10:05,101
No, I thought I gave him
the slip.

842
01:10:05,168 --> 01:10:06,503
You know this man?

843
01:10:07,504 --> 01:10:09,539
Well, I...

844
01:10:09,606 --> 01:10:12,842
I occasionally may have
manifested myself before
him, when... When

845
01:10:12,909 --> 01:10:16,246
times, we're particularly
slow, but he's, uh, just a
casual

846
01:10:16,313 --> 01:10:17,681
acquaintance, I assure you.

847
01:10:17,747 --> 01:10:19,916
You, shut that door.

848
01:10:26,823 --> 01:10:30,827
What were you doing
outside of this room?

849
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:33,997
Oh, just a, uh, spot of fresh
air, and, uh...

850
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,865
Uh, a little stretch of the
wings, that's all.

851
01:10:37,701 --> 01:10:41,638
This is Mrs. Memnet your
landlady. Do you shepherds
have girls in there?

852
01:10:42,539 --> 01:10:46,042
No, Mrs. Memnet, no girls.

853
01:10:46,476 --> 01:10:47,811
Sheep?

854
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:50,380
This town
disgusts me beyond belief.

855
01:10:51,381 --> 01:10:54,951
No, Mrs. Memnet, no sheep.

856
01:10:55,018 --> 01:10:57,821
Keep it quiet and
behave
yourselves.

857
01:10:58,388 --> 01:10:59,723
Or out you go!

858
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,692
Yes, Mrs. Memnet.

859
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:04,994
She's gone.

860
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:12,669
For too long now
this city has incurred

861
01:11:12,736 --> 01:11:14,971
His righteous indignation.

862
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,942
It must be
destroyed one more time.

863
01:11:19,976 --> 01:11:21,878
No.

864
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:26,683
If we go out on a limb
with one of these fancy
plagues of ours,

865
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:29,152
and it fizzles,
So, I say, and I think

866
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:31,388
we'll really
catch hell from Him. So...

867
01:11:32,556 --> 01:11:35,592
I say and I think
you'll agree,

868
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:40,296
we go with fire and brimstone.

869
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:41,931
Any questions?

870
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:46,302
You have something
on your mind?

871
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:51,074
Me! Uh, I have me on
mind. I mean, what about me?

872
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,542
What about you?

873
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:59,949
You cannot destroy me,
along with this city.
God has spoken with me.

874
01:12:00,016 --> 01:12:02,419
Uh, he does God real good.

875
01:12:02,486 --> 01:12:03,853
-Oh, no.
-No, no, do it, do it.

876
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,655
-No!
-Oh, it's really great!

877
01:12:05,722 --> 01:12:11,227
I... I must deliver His
people out of bondage,
in Egypt!

878
01:12:11,294 --> 01:12:12,696
And
my wife is here, too.

879
01:12:12,762 --> 01:12:14,631
-Zerelda's in town?
-Yes.

880
01:12:14,698 --> 01:12:17,501
Oh, all right. All right.

881
01:12:17,567 --> 01:12:20,236
You and your wife
will be spared.

882
01:12:20,303 --> 01:12:24,608
Only you must be
out of the gates before
midnight.

883
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:28,311
And one word of warning,
if either of you

884
01:12:28,378 --> 01:12:32,115
turn back to look in
the direction of the city,

885
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:36,686
you will be turned
into a pillar of salt.

886
01:12:36,753 --> 01:12:38,488
As Lot's wife was.

887
01:12:39,989 --> 01:12:41,891
Yeah. Thank you.

888
01:13:03,813 --> 01:13:05,248
Eunuch!

889
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:06,483
Yeah.

890
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:08,351
Shouldn't you be pouring
wine?

891
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,155
Then start pouring.

892
01:13:14,558 --> 01:13:15,825
Big boy, love it.

893
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:29,172
Zerelda!

894
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:33,076
Zerelda,
Zerelda, Zerelda.

895
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:37,947
Zerelda!

896
01:13:40,316 --> 01:13:41,317
Zerelda.

897
01:13:53,563 --> 01:13:54,731
Zerelda!

898
01:13:54,798 --> 01:13:57,501
Herschel, are you having fun?

899
01:13:57,567 --> 01:13:59,869
I'd given up hope of ever
finding you again.

900
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:01,471
More wine, eunuch!

901
01:14:01,538 --> 01:14:04,841
Dance over this way. I'm
one of the eunuchs
serving at the banquet.

902
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,179
More wine.

903
01:14:10,246 --> 01:14:12,381
Herschel, you have
changed.

904
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:14,918
Not in the least.

905
01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:16,520
Come on,
we're getting out of here.

906
01:14:16,586 --> 01:14:18,454
-What do you mean we're
getting out of here?
-Come on.

907
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:21,958
Beware!

908
01:14:22,025 --> 01:14:25,929
Turn from your evil ways
before God destroys you
and your city with fire

909
01:14:25,995 --> 01:14:27,463
from the sky...

910
01:14:29,933 --> 01:14:32,235
And put some clothes on.

911
01:14:40,109 --> 01:14:41,678
Grab your bag and
let's go, Zerelda.

912
01:14:41,745 --> 01:14:43,713
-Just one thing...
-Come on, don't pack.

913
01:14:49,252 --> 01:14:52,288
So it is true what they were
saying about you and
Amok, the giant.

914
01:14:52,355 --> 01:14:54,490
I'm sure I don't know who
you mean.

915
01:14:54,558 --> 01:14:56,125
Oh, come off it, Zerelda.

916
01:14:56,192 --> 01:14:57,927
He visits you here,
doesn't he?

917
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:01,030
Not anymore.

918
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:03,700
God! What were you doing
when I was in the salt
mine, wasting away?

919
01:15:03,767 --> 01:15:05,535
Well, you had God.

920
01:15:05,602 --> 01:15:08,204
So you just picked up and
chased after the first
giant you met.

921
01:15:08,271 --> 01:15:10,106
It was just a physical thing.

922
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:11,808
Oh, fine.

923
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:14,410
Amok and I were very
discreet about it.

924
01:15:14,477 --> 01:15:18,247
Discreet? They probably
saw you doing it as far
away as Babylonia.

925
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:20,884
Come on.

926
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:27,657
Come on, it's almost midnight.

927
01:15:27,724 --> 01:15:29,959
-I don't want to go.
-Come on.

928
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:43,039
I've made a lot of good
friends in Sodom

929
01:15:43,106 --> 01:15:45,441
and you didn't even give me a
chance to say goodbye.

930
01:15:45,508 --> 01:15:48,244
We haven't got time.
Don't look back.

931
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:50,446
Zerelda,
don't look back! Zerelda!

932
01:15:53,149 --> 01:15:54,784
Zerelda, answer me!

933
01:16:28,184 --> 01:16:30,286
Listen, if you want to be
alone, I'll understand.

934
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:31,988
Ah!

935
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:37,326
Oh, you've come to tempt
me, Devil.

936
01:16:37,393 --> 01:16:42,632
Man gives in to temptation
freely enough without any help
from me, thank you very much.

937
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:44,133
Tempt me, Devil, and
you'll fail.

938
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,468
Fine. Fine, fine.

939
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:48,471
Fine, just, please sit
down. Relax, don't get tense.

940
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:56,045
I've no intention of leading
you from the path of
righteousness or whatever.

941
01:16:57,747 --> 01:17:01,718
Can you believe that?
An entire city up in smoke.

942
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:03,619
What a temper.

943
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:06,990
Shouldn't you be in Hell?

944
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:09,759
Everyone in that city was
just damned.
I'm picking them up.

945
01:17:10,393 --> 01:17:12,428
Oh.

946
01:17:12,495 --> 01:17:15,098
I wasn't always the Devil
you know. I was an angel once.

947
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:17,867
You were?

948
01:17:17,934 --> 01:17:19,535
I've known Him longer
than anyone.

949
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:22,105
We started out together.
We were partners.

950
01:17:22,171 --> 01:17:24,573
How did you become the Devil?

951
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:26,409
Oh, it was very simple.

952
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,411
God comes over to me and
says, "Here, try this
on."

953
01:17:33,817 --> 01:17:35,384
Well, here come the
damned now.

954
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:36,619
They'll be expecting me.

955
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:41,825
Listen, you'd probably
be surprised to know

956
01:17:41,891 --> 01:17:44,460
that a lot of those
original ideas were mine.

957
01:17:44,527 --> 01:17:45,829
What do you mean?

958
01:17:45,895 --> 01:17:48,798
For instance, three of
the four seasons,
that was mine.

959
01:17:48,865 --> 01:17:49,866
Oh.

960
01:17:51,267 --> 01:17:53,770
-Great.
-Mmm-hmm. And trees. Mine.

961
01:17:53,837 --> 01:17:55,438
Trees, you like trees?

962
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,306
Trees, uh, trees are great.

963
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:59,142
My idea.

964
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:00,877
You're to be congratulated.

965
01:18:00,944 --> 01:18:02,045
Thank you.

966
01:18:02,111 --> 01:18:03,112
A pleasure.

967
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:04,180
But what can you do.

968
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:06,249
What can you do.

969
01:18:07,917 --> 01:18:10,754
Tears me up sometimes.

970
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:13,757
Herschel
continued forth across the
desert into Egypt

971
01:18:13,823 --> 01:18:15,691
to fulfill his mission.

972
01:18:15,759 --> 01:18:18,327
And to find his father,
Hyssop, where he had left him

973
01:18:18,394 --> 01:18:20,196
-in the comforts of his home.
-Hoppity hop, Hoppity
hop,

974
01:18:20,263 --> 01:18:21,831
Nobody's home.

975
01:18:21,898 --> 01:18:24,868
Come on, here we go.
There we go.

976
01:18:24,934 --> 01:18:26,435
There, that's a good boy.

977
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:27,904
Yes, there we go.

978
01:18:27,971 --> 01:18:30,273
I said no one is home.
Why...

979
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:34,010
Oh, oh, no.

980
01:18:34,077 --> 01:18:36,179
Oh, my son!

981
01:18:36,245 --> 01:18:38,581
-Oh, my son.
-Oh, Father!

982
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:40,716
Oh, my son. My...

983
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:46,255
Oh, my son. Oh, I missed you.

984
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:47,791
I missed you.

985
01:18:47,857 --> 01:18:51,427
Oh, it's so good to
have you home. Look at you,
you look wonderful.

986
01:18:51,494 --> 01:18:53,262
-Well...
-Let me see. Have
you lost any of your hair?

987
01:18:53,329 --> 01:18:55,431
-No.
-You will soon. Soon, soon.

988
01:18:55,498 --> 01:18:57,901
-Ah.
-You'll put on a few pounds,
just like me.

989
01:18:57,967 --> 01:18:59,602
Where are my things?

990
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:03,006
Oh, well, uh, things
were tough. I had to sell
a few little things.

991
01:19:03,072 --> 01:19:05,041
Not to worry.

992
01:19:05,108 --> 01:19:07,143
The house is in a mess.
You haven't looked after
it very well.

993
01:19:07,210 --> 01:19:08,744
And these frogs, they're
everywhere.

994
01:19:08,812 --> 01:19:10,980
Yes, the frogs are the
work of the chosen one

995
01:19:11,047 --> 01:19:13,216
who is called upon to
deliver us out of bondage.

996
01:19:13,282 --> 01:19:15,919
Why I didn't summon up
these frogs from the river.

997
01:19:15,985 --> 01:19:18,554
No, no, no, it is not of
you I speak. I speak of Moses.

998
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:20,689
Moses?

999
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:23,059
Last week Moses turned
the waters into blood.

1000
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:27,864
This week it's frogs.

1001
01:19:27,931 --> 01:19:32,936
Moses is the chosen one that
God has called upon to deliver
us out of bondage.

1002
01:19:33,002 --> 01:19:36,539
No, no, no, no! God
called upon me!

1003
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:37,740
I am the chosen one!

1004
01:19:39,175 --> 01:19:41,510
You're putting me on.

1005
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:44,848
Moses and I were... Were
shepherds together
in the wilderness.

1006
01:19:44,914 --> 01:19:49,252
He couldn't keep his flock.
I was always having to round
up his stragglers.

1007
01:19:49,318 --> 01:19:53,022
God wouldn't entrust somebody
like Moses with a
mission like that.

1008
01:19:53,089 --> 01:19:54,858
I know Moses.

1009
01:19:54,924 --> 01:19:58,027
His wife and my wife are
sisters, which makes him
my brother-in-law.

1010
01:19:58,995 --> 01:20:00,463
-You took a wife?
-Yes.

1011
01:20:02,098 --> 01:20:05,168
-Well...
-She's outside.

1012
01:20:05,234 --> 01:20:08,938
Well, bring her inside so I
can make my
daughter-in-law welcome.

1013
01:20:09,005 --> 01:20:10,874
She's a bit...

1014
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:13,609
You took a... Well, just
don't stand there, bring
her inside.

1015
01:20:13,676 --> 01:20:15,444
Don't keep the girl waiting.

1016
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:18,247
He took a wife.

1017
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:20,416
I thought I'd never
see the day.

1018
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:25,321
Oh, soon we'll have little
leaping children around,
instead of all these frogs.

1019
01:20:25,388 --> 01:20:27,756
I don't know how I
look. If only I'd been
prepared.

1020
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:30,960
Welcome to my house...

1021
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:39,002
My wife, Zerelda, Dad.

1022
01:20:48,611 --> 01:20:50,246
She seems like
a friendly girl.

1023
01:20:50,313 --> 01:20:53,816
-She is.
-Nice smile. Nice...

1024
01:20:53,883 --> 01:20:55,985
-Hands.
-Hands nice.

1025
01:20:56,052 --> 01:20:57,386
Hair...

1026
01:20:57,453 --> 01:20:59,755
My goodness, this is what
you've been up to.

1027
01:21:00,223 --> 01:21:01,224
Yeah.

1028
01:21:02,058 --> 01:21:03,059
Oh!

1029
01:21:03,726 --> 01:21:05,594
Maybe...

1030
01:21:05,661 --> 01:21:08,364
Maybe you ought to cover her
with a cloth.

1031
01:21:08,431 --> 01:21:13,669
I'd never forgive myself if,
uh, a daughter-in-law of mine
got chipped.

1032
01:21:13,736 --> 01:21:16,339
-Dad, don't make a
fuss, all right?
-No fuss.

1033
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:17,640
Please. It's all right.

1034
01:21:18,774 --> 01:21:21,044
It's all right. But
listen, listen.

1035
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:25,281
I have to clear
up this confusion about the
chosen one.

1036
01:21:25,348 --> 01:21:27,783
I, I have to gain an immediate
audience with Pharaoh.

1037
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,786
What if he remembers you?

1038
01:21:30,853 --> 01:21:33,622
What, what if he
remembers you? What then?
Then off comes your head!

1039
01:21:33,689 --> 01:21:35,124
I shall not be alone.

1040
01:21:35,191 --> 01:21:37,526
-Oh, I can't. I have work.
I've got to,
-Oh, no, no, no.

1041
01:21:37,593 --> 01:21:39,562
God will be with me.

1042
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:41,597
-Oh, yeah?
-Mmm.

1043
01:21:41,664 --> 01:21:43,866
-Oh, then I'll go along
for a couple of hours.
-Good.

1044
01:21:43,933 --> 01:21:45,801
Which one's the prophet?

1045
01:21:45,868 --> 01:21:47,803
How many minutes do you do?

1046
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:49,472
-Do?
-How long are you gonna be on?

1047
01:21:49,538 --> 01:21:51,007
Uh...

1048
01:21:51,074 --> 01:21:52,841
Yeah, right, right, keep
it short and funny, huh?

1049
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,477
You follow Timba the
dancing elephant.

1050
01:21:57,013 --> 01:21:59,082
Don't worry, the Lord
will be with me.

1051
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:01,951
Why the basket?

1052
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:05,221
If I tell you, you'll
just be angry.

1053
01:22:05,288 --> 01:22:07,123
I won't be angry.
Oh, you will.

1054
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:08,724
-I will not be angry.
-I promise you,
you'll be angry.

1055
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:10,426
I won't be angry.

1056
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:14,163
All right.

1057
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:16,765
I'll need the
basket when the Pharaoh
cuts off your head.

1058
01:22:16,832 --> 01:22:19,035
-Now that makes me angry.
-Prophet, you're on.

1059
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:43,092
And what do we do?

1060
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:44,893
We sing. We dance?

1061
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,197
I'm warning you.
Timba is a hell
of an act to follow.

1062
01:22:48,264 --> 01:22:50,066
I come in the name of the
One true God.

1063
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,736
Another damned prophet.

1064
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:57,106
The One true God.

1065
01:22:57,173 --> 01:23:00,309
Well, we'll just look him up
in the Book of Gods.

1066
01:23:00,376 --> 01:23:01,910
One True God.

1067
01:23:04,013 --> 01:23:07,116
One True this, One
True that, One
True, One True, One True...

1068
01:23:07,183 --> 01:23:09,718
I don't seem to
have much of One True
anything in my book.

1069
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:15,391
Perhaps, he changed his
name.

1070
01:23:24,267 --> 01:23:28,537
The whole universe is
filled with the might and
power of God!

1071
01:23:28,604 --> 01:23:30,539
He existed
before the world was created!

1072
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:34,677
It is He who stretched the
heavens above like a curtain.

1073
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:36,979
It is He who laid the
foundations of the earth.

1074
01:23:39,448 --> 01:23:43,386
I mean, if you concede
the Universe,
you must concede Him.

1075
01:23:43,452 --> 01:23:47,356
He created everything out of
nothing, even you, the
ruler of this kingdom!

1076
01:23:47,423 --> 01:23:50,493
That cannot be, for I am
God, I am...

1077
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:53,196
...the son of God.

1078
01:23:53,262 --> 01:23:55,664
He is the
son of the father of the son,

1079
01:23:56,832 --> 01:23:59,868
with the great father.
Faster, faster.

1080
01:23:59,935 --> 01:24:03,439
Who created the Nile
that gives life to everyone.

1081
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:06,542
Does...

1082
01:24:08,611 --> 01:24:10,946
Does your God have magic?

1083
01:24:11,013 --> 01:24:13,082
Ah, far greater than
Pharaoh's magic.

1084
01:24:14,217 --> 01:24:15,918
You tore your ass on that one.

1085
01:24:17,086 --> 01:24:19,122
Leon, hit it.

1086
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,829
What a honey, huh?

1087
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:28,231
Strike! Strike! Strike! Ah!

1088
01:24:37,606 --> 01:24:40,509
Mine takes a bit more
time to warm up.

1089
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:45,681
I know you from somewhere.

1090
01:24:51,154 --> 01:24:52,855
Faster with
the fan, please.

1091
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,990
And, uh, I'll have
a pistachio later.

1092
01:24:55,057 --> 01:24:56,492
Let my people go.

1093
01:24:59,128 --> 01:25:00,663
Um, hum a few bars.

1094
01:25:00,729 --> 01:25:03,866
Uh oh, no, that's my
pictures... What people?

1095
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,135
All the slaves you
hold in bondage.

1096
01:25:06,202 --> 01:25:08,070
There are no slaves in
bondage...

1097
01:25:08,137 --> 01:25:10,473
-They're gone.
-Gone?

1098
01:25:10,539 --> 01:25:11,540
Bye-bye.

1099
01:25:12,741 --> 01:25:13,742
Tip-toe.

1100
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:15,644
But who...

1101
01:25:16,545 --> 01:25:17,613
Who...

1102
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,681
Moses.

1103
01:25:20,082 --> 01:25:24,820
* The most beautiful sound
I ever heard *

1104
01:25:25,354 --> 01:25:26,855
Moses!

1105
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,392
Moses!

1106
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:30,459
Moses?

1107
01:25:31,727 --> 01:25:32,828
He had great magic.

1108
01:25:34,763 --> 01:25:37,200
His staff devoured

1109
01:25:37,266 --> 01:25:38,401
Ian's staff.

1110
01:25:40,169 --> 01:25:41,170
Moses.

1111
01:25:43,172 --> 01:25:44,940
I'm gonna kick his ass,
you know that, don't you?

1112
01:25:45,007 --> 01:25:47,310
How could you let Moses
take them?

1113
01:25:47,376 --> 01:25:49,212
The man was phenomenal.

1114
01:25:49,278 --> 01:25:52,481
What, are you kidding me?
Did you ever see Moses'
shit in action?

1115
01:25:52,548 --> 01:25:55,984
There must be some
mistake. I was supposed
to deliver them from bondage.

1116
01:25:56,051 --> 01:25:58,053
We all got a cross to
bear, all right?

1117
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:00,389
Moses put some
heavy action on it.

1118
01:26:00,456 --> 01:26:03,926
Curses on our homes.
Ten plagues on my house.

1119
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:07,663
And if that wasn't bad
enough, he split the Red
Sea in half.

1120
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:09,432
Moses?

1121
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:12,935
I mean, zip, down the
middle.
Cover quick, and no excuses.

1122
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,171
You like fruit?

1123
01:26:18,741 --> 01:26:20,309
Bring me a grape,

1124
01:26:20,376 --> 01:26:22,878
pluck it into my
mouth, foolish prophet.

1125
01:26:32,855 --> 01:26:36,559
You heard only the boys. Ah.

1126
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:38,093
Did you wash your hands,
you scoundrel?

1127
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,929
No, I, I didn't. Sorry.

1128
01:26:40,996 --> 01:26:42,097
Away with you.

1129
01:26:48,504 --> 01:26:49,972
Nourish thyself,
Divine
One.

1130
01:26:50,739 --> 01:26:52,275
Stargazer!

1131
01:26:53,309 --> 01:26:54,610
Flee, father, flee!

1132
01:26:54,677 --> 01:26:55,678
Would you hold this a
minute please?

1133
01:26:59,348 --> 01:27:00,349
Excuse me.

1134
01:27:01,917 --> 01:27:06,021
Cast Herschel, the Stargazer
into the dungeon!

1135
01:27:06,088 --> 01:27:09,525
Tomorrow you'll
be fitting entertainment
for my court.

1136
01:27:09,592 --> 01:27:12,561
Oh, I'll rehearse some
new harp and lute
numbers immediately.

1137
01:27:12,628 --> 01:27:17,566
Your beheading shall be
quite enough entertainment.

1138
01:27:17,633 --> 01:27:20,736
Beheading? I, what if
I'm a hit and you want a
repeat performance?

1139
01:27:20,803 --> 01:27:23,071
So let it be written!

1140
01:27:23,138 --> 01:27:24,773
So let it be done!

1141
01:27:26,642 --> 01:27:29,278
Big boy, love it! Just
perfect.

1142
01:27:46,662 --> 01:27:47,663
Everybody.

1143
01:27:49,965 --> 01:27:51,834
I was once
angel of the Lord.

1144
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:54,236
That should be good
for at least one drink on
the house,

1145
01:27:54,303 --> 01:27:56,739
in any reputable wine shop!

1146
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:07,350
-Excuse me.
-Oh, that, that's all
right. That's all right.

1147
01:28:07,416 --> 01:28:11,554
I, uh... I couldn't
help overhearing.

1148
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:13,456
If you are truly the Angel of
the Lord.

1149
01:28:13,522 --> 01:28:16,091
It's not "are", do you
understand what I'm
saying? It is "was".

1150
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:18,093
Was, was, the Angel of
the Lord.

1151
01:28:20,863 --> 01:28:22,598
Then you must know my son.

1152
01:28:22,665 --> 01:28:24,767
A prophet of the Lord.

1153
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:28,136
I'm, I'm sure you
must have bumped into each
other somewhere along the way.

1154
01:28:28,203 --> 01:28:30,339
My son is in the
Pharaoh's dungeon.

1155
01:28:30,406 --> 01:28:33,108
The Pharaoh will cut off
his head unless you help him.

1156
01:28:33,175 --> 01:28:36,445
You are not listening to
what I have been talking
about, have you?

1157
01:28:36,512 --> 01:28:39,314
-Yeah.
-I am no longer the Angel
of the Lord.

1158
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:45,220
I am a Fallen Angel.

1159
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:49,858
Disgraced, dishonored,

1160
01:28:49,925 --> 01:28:51,326
reproached,

1161
01:28:51,394 --> 01:28:52,995
dismissed from all favor,

1162
01:28:54,897 --> 01:28:57,800
put to
shame, put down,

1163
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,334
and tarnished.

1164
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:03,639
Oh, I'm sorry.

1165
01:29:05,974 --> 01:29:09,144
You have no hope with me.

1166
01:29:09,211 --> 01:29:14,216
You see, my son was
supposed to deliver the
slaves out of bondage,

1167
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:16,519
-but everything went wrong.
-Don't cry.

1168
01:29:16,585 --> 01:29:20,022
It's been a terrible day.
I've been holding it in
all day long, I can't...

1169
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:21,890
-Don't, don't cry.
-I know... I knew when you
said I'm the...

1170
01:29:21,957 --> 01:29:24,126
I was the
Angel of the Lord, I
thought, here it is...

1171
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:26,261
-I understand, I understand.
I'll tell you what...
-What?

1172
01:29:26,328 --> 01:29:28,431
-...I'm going to do...
-What? What?

1173
01:29:28,497 --> 01:29:29,965
-I'm going to give it a try.
-You will?

1174
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:31,033
-Yes!
-That's all I ask.

1175
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:33,001
-But don't you dare...
-No. What?

1176
01:29:33,068 --> 01:29:36,505
-...expect any miracles.
-Never! Come, come, this
way. It's this way.

1177
01:29:36,572 --> 01:29:38,073
-Do you need any help?
No, I don't need any help.

1178
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:39,174
Come, come, come.

1179
01:29:53,188 --> 01:29:55,357
You! I might've
known it was you.

1180
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,259
-Boo!
-Oh!

1181
01:29:57,325 --> 01:29:58,561
A little surprise.

1182
01:29:58,627 --> 01:30:00,596
I brought the
Angel of the Lord, my son.

1183
01:30:00,663 --> 01:30:01,897
-Former.
-Yeah, former.

1184
01:30:03,699 --> 01:30:05,568
Listen,

1185
01:30:05,634 --> 01:30:07,603
there's very little
of the night left.

1186
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:09,538
And my head...

1187
01:30:09,605 --> 01:30:11,640
My head comes off at dawn.

1188
01:30:11,707 --> 01:30:12,708
So...

1189
01:30:15,844 --> 01:30:16,845
What are you doing?

1190
01:30:16,912 --> 01:30:19,782
Mmm, nothing, nothing.

1191
01:30:19,848 --> 01:30:21,950
You will be out
of here before you know it.

1192
01:30:22,017 --> 01:30:23,986
You'll be free, my son.

1193
01:30:24,052 --> 01:30:26,622
I told you dad
would fix it up.

1194
01:30:26,689 --> 01:30:31,894
You'll be out walking,
and singing and shopping,
for my new chains.

1195
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:34,630
-You promised me, remember?
-No, no, I won't start.

1196
01:30:34,697 --> 01:30:36,699
-You remember?
-Do you think you can do it?

1197
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:37,800
Not a prayer.

1198
01:30:37,866 --> 01:30:39,602
What am I going to do
with my son?

1199
01:30:39,668 --> 01:30:41,937
Don't cry, don't cry.

1200
01:30:42,004 --> 01:30:45,508
I'll tell you what I'll do,
I'll give these old wings
one last flap. All right?

1201
01:30:45,574 --> 01:30:47,209
And then maybe
we can spring him.

1202
01:30:47,275 --> 01:30:49,778
I know you can do it. Here,
let me put this around
your waist.

1203
01:30:49,845 --> 01:30:52,515
Here, oh, oh...
You all right?

1204
01:30:52,581 --> 01:30:54,349
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

1205
01:30:54,416 --> 01:30:57,920
Here, let's put it...
Let's put it over your
shoulders, between the wings.

1206
01:30:57,986 --> 01:31:01,156
I know you're
gonna do it. I know it.

1207
01:31:01,223 --> 01:31:02,858
Okay, okay.

1208
01:31:07,129 --> 01:31:09,331
Pull! Pull!

1209
01:31:09,397 --> 01:31:10,533
Pull!

1210
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:14,637
Oh!

1211
01:31:14,703 --> 01:31:17,472
Yes, come on.
Here, help me.

1212
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:19,474
All right, I gotcha.

1213
01:31:19,542 --> 01:31:22,578
I've gotcha.
All right, now. The
other one.

1214
01:31:22,645 --> 01:31:23,646
Okay.

1215
01:31:27,916 --> 01:31:29,017
You did it!

1216
01:31:30,553 --> 01:31:31,820
Was there ever any doubt?

1217
01:31:32,855 --> 01:31:34,022
We must go.

1218
01:31:34,089 --> 01:31:35,390
Thank you.

1219
01:31:35,457 --> 01:31:36,725
Oh.

1220
01:31:36,792 --> 01:31:38,160
-It's all right,
it's all right.
-I, I hope you get your

1221
01:31:38,226 --> 01:31:39,461
-wing back on.
-I will.

1222
01:31:39,528 --> 01:31:41,597
You're really impossible,
you know that though.

1223
01:31:41,664 --> 01:31:43,231
You can take care of
yourself from now on.

1224
01:31:43,298 --> 01:31:45,000
Yeah. Thank you.

1225
01:31:45,067 --> 01:31:47,102
-Come. Thank you.
-Thank you.

1226
01:31:47,169 --> 01:31:49,905
Goodbye.

1227
01:31:49,972 --> 01:31:54,643
And so,
once more Herschel fled from
the wrath of Pharaoh.

1228
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:58,113
And came to dwell again under
the shadow of Sinai.

1229
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,716
Where his path crossed
with Moses one last time.

1230
01:32:03,819 --> 01:32:04,987
It kills me.

1231
01:32:05,053 --> 01:32:07,389
It kills me.
I love it, I just love it.

1232
01:32:07,455 --> 01:32:10,593
I told you, Moses doesn't
like you fooling around
with his things.

1233
01:32:14,897 --> 01:32:16,765
Ah, that about does it.

1234
01:32:19,935 --> 01:32:22,805
I couldn't have left Moses
alone and forsaken
on the mountain.

1235
01:32:24,573 --> 01:32:28,343
Even if it meant putting up
with him for forty days
and forty nights.

1236
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:30,478
If I hear about the parting
of the Red Sea one more time,

1237
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:32,648
I'll stuff these tablets
down his throat.

1238
01:32:32,715 --> 01:32:33,982
And he never leaves our tent.

1239
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:39,622
Moses would never leave the
tent and face the people
without the Commandments

1240
01:32:39,688 --> 01:32:40,989
God promised him.

1241
01:32:41,056 --> 01:32:44,693
A promise is like a thick
blanket

1242
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:47,930
that leaves you shivering when
the weather turns cold.

1243
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:54,236
Well...

1244
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:59,474
Well, I could only
think of ten.

1245
01:33:03,011 --> 01:33:04,780
So, it's better than nothing.

1246
01:33:06,181 --> 01:33:08,984
Honor thy mother and
father. Did you include
that one?

1247
01:33:09,051 --> 01:33:10,719
-That was mine.
-Yes.

1248
01:33:10,786 --> 01:33:13,656
-What about all that coveting?
-Yes. Thou shalt not
covet. That's in.

1249
01:33:13,722 --> 01:33:15,624
-And then the, other one
about adultery.
-Mmm. Yeah.

1250
01:33:15,691 --> 01:33:17,793
Did you finally decide to
include that one?

1251
01:33:17,860 --> 01:33:19,227
And the other one,
that's a good one.

1252
01:33:19,294 --> 01:33:20,963
The other one about,
you know, not taking
other people's things.

1253
01:33:21,029 --> 01:33:23,165
Yes, yes, yes.

1254
01:33:23,231 --> 01:33:24,232
-You need any help?
-No.

1255
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,553
Those two tables were a
lot of work, you know?

1256
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:47,455
Mmm.

1257
01:33:47,522 --> 01:33:48,757
I just hope he takes
care of them.

1258
01:33:50,592 --> 01:33:51,994
All those years it was Moses.

1259
01:33:54,062 --> 01:33:55,764
Moses all along. Not me.

1260
01:33:59,902 --> 01:34:01,303
I've got work to do.

1261
01:34:22,557 --> 01:34:23,558
Mmm.

1262
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:26,962
My greatest work.

1263
01:34:37,773 --> 01:34:40,976
You know, there are already
those who've made
inquiries about you.

1264
01:34:43,578 --> 01:34:44,947
You will soon have

1265
01:34:46,648 --> 01:34:49,651
a multitude of worshippers.

1266
01:34:49,718 --> 01:34:52,821
You'll soon have burnt
offerings galore.

1267
01:34:57,359 --> 01:34:59,928
Soon,

1268
01:34:59,995 --> 01:35:04,399
all the world will bow down
and kiss your granite asp.

1269
01:35:11,807 --> 01:35:13,475
Fell right into my trap.

1270
01:35:20,749 --> 01:35:22,484
Ah!

1271
01:35:23,385 --> 01:35:26,654
I know you're a jealous God.

1272
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:29,858
I knew an idol, such as this,
would arouse your wrath
and bring you down here.

1273
01:35:29,925 --> 01:35:31,193
I planned it.

1274
01:35:31,259 --> 01:35:32,427
So, speak up.

1275
01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:40,502
Thou shalt have
no other gods before me.

1276
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:43,038
You like that?
That's number one.

1277
01:35:43,105 --> 01:35:45,473
I had you in mind
when I wrote it.

1278
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:49,111
Ha. I only had this idol for
bait. So now you're here
with me.

1279
01:35:49,177 --> 01:35:50,946
And now you will hear me.

1280
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:57,886
Thank you.

1281
01:35:59,788 --> 01:36:00,789
Thank you.

1282
01:36:05,894 --> 01:36:10,565
I lived in your
world's cradle of civilization

1283
01:36:10,632 --> 01:36:15,637
and all men knew was poverty,
war and slavery.

1284
01:36:17,272 --> 01:36:21,609
Now what I want to know is,
where were you?

1285
01:36:21,676 --> 01:36:25,547
I mean, let it be known if
you're keeping another
world on the side.

1286
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:27,649
Let it be known if
you created two worlds

1287
01:36:27,715 --> 01:36:30,385
and you're spending all
the time with the other one.

1288
01:36:30,452 --> 01:36:32,187
I mean, that would
answer one of my questions.

1289
01:36:35,858 --> 01:36:39,027
Who are you to
question the Lord?

1290
01:36:39,094 --> 01:36:40,228
Who am I?

1291
01:36:41,196 --> 01:36:43,031
I am man!

1292
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:46,601
Ah!

1293
01:36:46,668 --> 01:36:50,205
Was it you who commanded
the morning to bring on
the day?

1294
01:36:50,272 --> 01:36:54,309
Can your voice
reach the clouds and
bring on the rain?

1295
01:36:54,376 --> 01:36:57,612
Can you send down lightning?

1296
01:36:57,679 --> 01:37:01,349
Does the hawk soar
because of your wisdom?

1297
01:37:01,416 --> 01:37:04,987
Does the eagle fly at
your command?

1298
01:37:05,053 --> 01:37:07,789
And so I ask again,

1299
01:37:07,856 --> 01:37:10,292
who is this mortal

1300
01:37:10,358 --> 01:37:14,229
who finds fault
with the Lord?

1301
01:37:14,296 --> 01:37:17,299
Who questions his judgment?

1302
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:29,077
And who just stopped the rain?

1303
01:37:32,414 --> 01:37:33,481
Very good.

1304
01:37:37,119 --> 01:37:39,254
I'm impressed.
I'm impressed.
Good, good stuff.

1305
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:43,658
Listen,

1306
01:37:44,993 --> 01:37:46,561
tell me,

1307
01:37:46,628 --> 01:37:49,831
how could you get on letting
me believe all this time

1308
01:37:49,898 --> 01:37:53,101
that I was the chosen one,
but all along it was Moses?

1309
01:37:57,105 --> 01:37:58,673
I believed you were with me.

1310
01:37:59,407 --> 01:38:01,409
I was with you.

1311
01:38:01,476 --> 01:38:04,546
When were you ever with me?

1312
01:38:04,612 --> 01:38:09,251
I was with you during the
writing of the
Ten Commandments.

1313
01:38:09,317 --> 01:38:12,787
Nobody was with me
during the writing of the
Ten Commandments.

1314
01:38:14,122 --> 01:38:17,325
Well, uh, except my
father and he was...

1315
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:21,029
You wrote the
Commandments through
me,

1316
01:38:21,096 --> 01:38:25,367
and I gave them to
Moses through you.

1317
01:38:25,833 --> 01:38:27,302
Oh, um,

1318
01:38:28,536 --> 01:38:29,537
thanks.

1319
01:38:30,605 --> 01:38:31,606
Thanks a lot.

1320
01:38:35,443 --> 01:38:37,279
I mean I, am I going to
believe...

1321
01:38:37,345 --> 01:38:41,616
Am I going to be remembered
for my participation
in any of this?

1322
01:38:41,683 --> 01:38:43,885
Someone will know.

1323
01:38:43,952 --> 01:38:47,855
Somewhere, someday.

1324
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:50,993
Well, all right, as long
as someone knows.

1325
01:38:52,827 --> 01:38:54,629
I mean, I would...

1326
01:38:56,431 --> 01:38:58,400
I would hate to be
forgotten, you know?

1327
01:38:59,167 --> 01:39:00,735
I understand.

1328
01:39:01,603 --> 01:39:02,604
You do?

1329
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:07,342
One more thing, Herschel,

1330
01:39:07,409 --> 01:39:10,178
you don't do me very well.

1331
01:39:10,245 --> 01:39:13,781
So, no more impressions.

1332
01:39:19,921 --> 01:39:22,257
-What was that?
-Uh, the bus.

1333
01:39:24,359 --> 01:39:25,360
Yes, it's getting late.

1334
01:39:25,427 --> 01:39:26,494
Um...

1335
01:39:27,829 --> 01:39:29,497
Let's take this back.

1336
01:39:29,564 --> 01:39:31,866
Take it back to town. We can
read the rest of it there.

1337
01:39:31,933 --> 01:39:33,801
-All right.
-And be careful of it.

1338
01:39:35,337 --> 01:39:37,039
Oh, boy!

1339
01:39:51,453 --> 01:39:54,022
Oh, no, God!

1340
01:39:54,089 --> 01:39:55,857
Oh, God, the book is gone.

1341
01:39:57,192 --> 01:39:58,193
Oh, God.

1342
01:39:59,994 --> 01:40:02,064
Well...

1343
01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:04,366
That's the end of
Herschel and Zerelda.

1344
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:32,094
Three bucks?

1345
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:34,262
All right, make sure you
all have your belongings.

1346
01:40:36,098 --> 01:40:38,032
Take your time, there sister.

1347
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:40,468
Right, allright, sister.

1348
01:40:41,503 --> 01:40:42,770
Okay, now everyone.

1349
01:40:42,837 --> 01:40:45,973
Look, if there is a God,
why would he have us

1350
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:48,276
find
that book and then...

1351
01:40:48,343 --> 01:40:49,877
And then have it blown away
in the wind.

1352
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:53,081
You know what they say.

1353
01:40:53,148 --> 01:40:55,016
The Lord works in
mysterious ways.

1354
01:40:55,083 --> 01:40:57,952
Well, uh...

1355
01:40:58,019 --> 01:41:02,190
We'll have another
stop very, very shortly.

1356
01:41:02,257 --> 01:41:05,827
Uh, but we'll
have to...
Oh, Mohammed!

1357
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:08,796
Mohammed, I'm stuck,
I'm stuck in the door.

1358
01:41:08,863 --> 01:41:11,499
Mohammed, stop
the bus? Mohammed!

1359
01:41:13,268 --> 01:41:14,269
Stop it!
