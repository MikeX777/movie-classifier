1
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:21,647
Sindrome Astenica

2
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:58,191
It is well worth it for everybody
to read Lev Tolstoy.

3
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:05,757
So they will understand everything
and become goodhearted and intelligent.

4
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,539
I had a terrible obsession

5
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:22,970
I loved to eat a snack
here and there

6
00:02:23,514 --> 00:02:25,521
I worked at the Postal
office for 15 years

7
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:28,154
Every time I would
deliver a telegram

8
00:02:28,656 --> 00:02:31,917
I would enter in a canteen or a drugstore

9
00:02:32,168 --> 00:02:34,425
And I would eat some snack

10
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:38,105
And so on for each delivery!

11
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,487
Or going on my road

12
00:02:42,369 --> 00:02:45,629
I would eat bread and sausage by a fence

13
00:03:00,262 --> 00:03:01,892
Good kitty!

14
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:30,465
Now let's say goodbye to him!

15
00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:32,806
God, what will we do now?

16
00:06:35,524 --> 00:06:37,697
Why did you leave us?

17
00:06:38,408 --> 00:06:39,996
Why?

18
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,798
What will we do?

19
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:48,943
Why did you went away? God!

20
00:06:49,737 --> 00:06:51,618
Natasha, pull yourself together.

21
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:53,332
Calm down.

22
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:55,674
Dear, why did you leave us?

23
00:06:57,513 --> 00:07:01,778
What are you saying?
Me and Semjon Aleksandrovich too...

24
00:07:03,617 --> 00:07:07,714
We will carry this pain for all our life!

25
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:10,557
What will we do?

26
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,570
You're joking!

27
00:07:17,957 --> 00:07:19,378
Where are you going?

28
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:21,970
Close it.

29
00:07:25,732 --> 00:07:27,865
Should we close it or not?

30
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,593
She went away! What shall we do?

31
00:07:34,094 --> 00:07:37,982
We can't stay here a month!
We have no time to lose!

32
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,825
Now she'll be back. Wait!

33
00:08:18,473 --> 00:08:20,605
Natasha...
- Don't touch her.

34
00:08:22,738 --> 00:08:24,452
Leave her alone.

35
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:37,452
Go to hell everyone!

36
00:11:01,856 --> 00:11:06,152
So she began telling me
about the snake

37
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:09,071
Living inside her.

38
00:11:09,989 --> 00:11:12,074
I can't remember were it was exactly,

39
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:14,452
Somewhere near the breasts.

40
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,205
It was sucking her life energy.

41
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:20,332
It's a fixation.

42
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,835
A kind of obsession.

43
00:11:24,628 --> 00:11:26,672
Yes, it's an obsession.

44
00:11:27,673 --> 00:11:29,467
Just ignore it! Just ignore it!

45
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:31,343
What were you saying?

46
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:35,389
What are you doing here rather?
-I'm going to a doctor, my bones aches.

47
00:11:35,806 --> 00:11:37,808
Fantastic, Vasilij Pavlovich!

48
00:11:38,225 --> 00:11:42,354
Are you going now?
-Yes, I'm going to this healer.

49
00:11:43,147 --> 00:11:45,357
He lives here, out of town.

50
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:49,195
I'm going there too.
-Really?

51
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:53,491
It was indeed that bone-fixer

52
00:11:53,824 --> 00:11:57,745
that healed her from her snake fixation.

53
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,373
How could he do it, if he only fix the bones?

54
00:12:01,707 --> 00:12:06,378
He's very flexible, very good.

55
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:11,634
Fantastic, terrific!

56
00:12:12,802 --> 00:12:15,596
Let's go down there,
to the bus stop.

57
00:12:21,018 --> 00:12:24,605
What's all that chatting?

58
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:26,941
Here is the bus.

59
00:12:27,358 --> 00:12:29,777
Again with these dry flowers!

60
00:12:30,486 --> 00:12:33,948
You can't get in!
-This is the end of journey!

61
00:13:23,873 --> 00:13:26,417
Where are you going?
You can't get off from this door!

62
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:31,464
Help me.
-Let me help you miss.

63
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:33,632
Here, get in.

64
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:36,719
Help me.
-Go on.

65
00:14:20,096 --> 00:14:23,390
Do you want to go to bed with me?
-What! Stop that!

66
00:14:23,766 --> 00:14:27,478
Bastard, worm!
-I'll kill you!

67
00:14:29,063 --> 00:14:30,856
Leave me alone, you bastard!

68
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:34,610
She jumped on me, she's crazy!

69
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:37,571
What do you want from me?
-I hate you bastards!

70
00:14:38,906 --> 00:14:42,701
She harassed me without a reason.
-You're alive, I hate you!

71
00:14:43,536 --> 00:14:46,455
Why you scream? You started it!

72
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,334
You're bastard, you sick!

73
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:55,339
Look at you, you're sick,
go cure yourself.

74
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:58,759
You're a bitch, look at you!

75
00:15:00,636 --> 00:15:02,012
Stupid!

76
00:15:02,471 --> 00:15:04,473
You ruined my day.

77
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:35,671
Here she come!

78
00:15:52,313 --> 00:15:53,981
Leave me alone.

79
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,192
I don't need you.

80
00:15:57,068 --> 00:16:00,654
What happens to you?
-I don't need you, do you understand?

81
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,908
What did she say?
-Nothing.

82
00:16:04,325 --> 00:16:06,786
Where has she been?
-I don't know.

83
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:09,038
I know nothing.

84
00:16:20,925 --> 00:16:22,676
Don't behave this way.

85
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:26,055
You're here too.

86
00:16:27,014 --> 00:16:28,641
What do you want?

87
00:16:29,058 --> 00:16:31,060
They're friends, but who are you?

88
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,732
People hurry, going to work,

89
00:21:28,274 --> 00:21:29,775
it's 8 o'clock.

90
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:33,696
At a window, second floor...

91
00:21:36,574 --> 00:21:39,201
They hurry, I hurry...

92
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,611
Good morning, doctor.

93
00:23:02,952 --> 00:23:04,495
I...

94
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,275
Natasha, where's Nikolaj Mikhajlovich?

95
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,826
My god!

96
00:25:09,829 --> 00:25:11,038
Hello Natasha.

97
00:25:11,372 --> 00:25:14,875
You have a bad breath
and your hairdo doesn't suit you.

98
00:25:22,591 --> 00:25:24,635
"I BEG YOU

99
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,430
TO ACCEPT
MY RESIGNATION"

100
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,571
Take an holiday, instead.

101
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,866
I don't need your advices.

102
00:25:50,202 --> 00:25:53,873
I don't think I deserve this attitude.

103
00:25:56,292 --> 00:26:00,379
Why do you speak to me in this tone?

104
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:04,300
I say what I feel.

105
00:26:04,884 --> 00:26:06,635
What's my fault?

106
00:26:06,969 --> 00:26:08,804
Why you despise me?

107
00:26:11,223 --> 00:26:15,061
You're going to sign or not?
-First I'd like to understand.

108
00:26:15,728 --> 00:26:17,063
What happens to you?

109
00:26:17,438 --> 00:26:20,024
You just buried your husband but...

110
00:26:21,108 --> 00:26:24,111
Don't you dare to talk to me about this!

111
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,908
You're not worth my husband's nail,
you're old, you...

112
00:26:29,408 --> 00:26:30,743
Yes! Yes!

113
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:41,085
Why you decided to resign?

114
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,212
My business.

115
00:26:45,464 --> 00:26:50,177
All passes, all is forgiven, you're young.

116
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,472
You're alive, my husband's not.

117
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,893
Nothing to understand, sign.

118
00:27:22,835 --> 00:27:25,379
Good bye, Natalja Ivanovna.

119
00:27:26,464 --> 00:27:27,924
Hello! Hello! Hello!

120
00:28:34,907 --> 00:28:36,325
You wreck!
The road is not your own!

121
00:28:36,867 --> 00:28:38,744
I hate you!

122
00:28:40,162 --> 00:28:41,914
All of you!
-Sorry!

123
00:28:42,957 --> 00:28:46,460
Please forgive me if you can!

124
00:28:46,836 --> 00:28:48,838
Miss, you...
-Go away.

125
00:28:56,012 --> 00:28:58,931
Miss...
-You're still here?

126
00:29:02,518 --> 00:29:05,062
Sorry!

127
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:06,981
I'm really sorry!

128
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:10,568
May I help you?

129
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:27,752
Don't touch her, I've already tried!

130
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:30,004
Has some disgrace
happened to you?

131
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:34,592
Calm yourself.

132
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:37,595
-Leave her alone!

133
00:29:38,095 --> 00:29:39,639
Let me go!

134
00:30:30,314 --> 00:30:31,524
Well done!

135
00:30:31,983 --> 00:30:34,193
They should be
taught some good manners!

136
00:30:35,528 --> 00:30:37,280
They don't have any conscience.

137
00:30:57,758 --> 00:31:00,469
I go to the repairs office
and say I'm a veteran.

138
00:31:00,803 --> 00:31:05,141
They say they don't have pipes,
but where else I could get them?

139
00:31:11,147 --> 00:31:13,649
Sorry.

140
00:31:17,653 --> 00:31:19,572
Watch out!
-Look where you're going.

141
00:31:19,947 --> 00:31:22,116
Impudent!
-Goat!

142
00:31:29,665 --> 00:31:32,501
Miss, are you free?
-Animal!

143
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:44,680
Let's go.

144
00:32:13,918 --> 00:32:15,461
Come on.

145
00:32:16,212 --> 00:32:17,672
Get up.

146
00:32:56,502 --> 00:32:58,838
I'll follow you. -Go in.

147
00:33:10,933 --> 00:33:12,226
Undress.

148
00:34:34,976 --> 00:34:36,310
No!

149
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:39,480
Go away!

150
00:34:39,939 --> 00:34:41,607
Out of here!

151
00:34:42,608 --> 00:34:44,151
Go away!

152
00:37:00,913 --> 00:37:03,040
Here's all wet.

153
00:37:03,916 --> 00:37:05,376
Look out, there's a woman.

154
00:37:05,918 --> 00:37:09,297
Don't crush her.
-Don't crush my feet!

155
00:37:09,755 --> 00:37:11,424
OK, we've done through it.

156
00:37:11,882 --> 00:37:14,010
Is there a hoist?
-Yes.

157
00:37:14,427 --> 00:37:16,846
But sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

158
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,277
Miss, wait!

159
00:37:31,777 --> 00:37:34,530
You have dirt on your shoulders, let me clean you.

160
00:37:36,115 --> 00:37:37,074
Here.

161
00:37:39,744 --> 00:37:41,621
There's a stain too.

162
00:37:42,788 --> 00:37:44,540
Have patience.

163
00:37:48,753 --> 00:37:51,088
Wait, I'm not over.

164
00:37:55,426 --> 00:37:57,553
Just a moment, don't run away,

165
00:37:58,012 --> 00:37:59,847
Now I'll clean it for you.

166
00:38:00,765 --> 00:38:02,892
Now is just a small stain.

167
00:38:04,685 --> 00:38:07,396
Just a little more... here, done,

168
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:10,775
You can go.

169
00:38:13,778 --> 00:38:14,779
You're welcome.

170
00:38:21,702 --> 00:38:23,371
Just a moment, don't run away,

171
00:38:23,663 --> 00:38:25,498
Now I'll clean it for you.

172
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:28,417
Now is just a small stain.

173
00:38:30,211 --> 00:38:32,922
Just a little more... here, done,

174
00:38:33,464 --> 00:38:35,841
You can go.

175
00:38:38,803 --> 00:38:40,429
You're welcome.

176
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,025
Hello, comrades!

177
00:38:53,693 --> 00:38:57,446
I want to introduce you to the main
actress of the movie you've just seen,

178
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,615
Olga Serghejevna Antonova.

179
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:02,034
Please don't go away,

180
00:39:02,368 --> 00:39:06,038
We have the chance
to talk about our impressions

181
00:39:06,414 --> 00:39:08,249
And to ask questions.

182
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:12,128
It doesn't often happen
to see a movie engaged...

183
00:39:15,256 --> 00:39:16,882
What are you doing?

184
00:39:17,216 --> 00:39:20,887
Are you crazy?
-You have to take off your hat!

185
00:39:23,973 --> 00:39:27,602
by directors like German,
Sokurov and Muratova.

186
00:39:28,352 --> 00:39:32,189
We can talk, ask some questions.

187
00:39:33,357 --> 00:39:35,276
Comrades, please!

188
00:39:35,735 --> 00:39:38,738
Go back to your seats, please.

189
00:39:39,864 --> 00:39:44,285
We have the chance to meet
a maestro of cinema

190
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:47,622
A person who participated...

191
00:39:47,997 --> 00:39:49,457
Just a moment.

192
00:39:53,044 --> 00:39:56,005
Mom, you promised me an ice-cream.
-We'll see.

193
00:39:57,298 --> 00:39:59,133
Where do we go?

194
00:39:59,508 --> 00:40:01,427
What's the use of movies like this?

195
00:40:01,844 --> 00:40:04,847
I'm already tired, out of exercise

196
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:09,185
I'd like to have fun, listen to some music
instead of watching such movies.

197
00:40:11,395 --> 00:40:15,441
I didn't want to see these people
carrying the coffin, burying...

198
00:40:16,317 --> 00:40:19,528
What kind of topic!
-Aljosha, you're tired.

199
00:40:19,904 --> 00:40:21,656
I love you so much!

200
00:40:21,948 --> 00:40:24,784
Your smell!
I could die right now.

201
00:40:25,243 --> 00:40:27,787
Your face.

202
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,164
You look like an angel!

203
00:40:30,456 --> 00:40:32,833
Comrades, stop, please.

204
00:40:33,376 --> 00:40:36,879
We can ask questions...

205
00:40:37,213 --> 00:40:39,215
Let it go, I'm leaving.

206
00:40:39,507 --> 00:40:41,259
Sorry.

207
00:40:41,634 --> 00:40:43,219
Don't do that, don't go away.

208
00:40:43,594 --> 00:40:46,180
What a shame!
-Please.

209
00:40:54,897 --> 00:40:58,234
It was Olga Serghjevna,
probably she'll be back.

210
00:40:58,526 --> 00:41:02,238
I advise you not to miss
such a chance,

211
00:41:02,655 --> 00:41:05,324
The movie we've just seen...

212
00:41:07,118 --> 00:41:11,747
The cinema engaged today...

213
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:16,210
It's worth to be studied in depth.

214
00:41:25,761 --> 00:41:27,597
Get up!

215
00:41:28,556 --> 00:41:29,974
Get in two rows!

216
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:19,404
Help me.

217
00:46:48,808 --> 00:46:50,226
Is he drunk?

218
00:46:52,395 --> 00:46:54,439
No, he's just sleeping.

219
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:03,490
Thanks.

220
00:48:41,755 --> 00:48:43,840
...have to right it down...

221
00:48:45,216 --> 00:48:47,719
"He was middle-aged, or so he believed

222
00:48:48,053 --> 00:48:50,638
The dark spotted by
some street light

223
00:48:50,972 --> 00:48:53,850
Wrapped him in a veil
of musings on himself.

224
00:48:54,225 --> 00:48:57,937
He thought of himself ironically,
with a touch of sadness.

225
00:48:58,188 --> 00:49:01,775
His soul,
closed in the shell of life,

226
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:05,362
It was weighted down by the
wrinkles of his ancient feelings.

227
00:49:05,654 --> 00:49:09,115
He tried to be good to everyone,
but it was impossible.

228
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:12,744
He tied new knots
before loosing the old one

229
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:16,748
the weight became heavier,
but he couldn't let it go.

230
00:49:16,998 --> 00:49:19,542
He wanted something romantic!

231
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:22,504
A song would do it too.

232
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:26,424
He wanted "Sever" cigarettes
and curly hairs back in fashion,

233
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:30,095
That people would say
"I love you" with a slight stutter.

234
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:32,597
The blow of the wind,
of a laughter,

235
00:49:32,889 --> 00:49:34,808
Of nebulous forebodings of love,

236
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,310
Or rather not,
love was too concrete.

237
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,731
The lowered sights,
the ambiguity of smiles...

238
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:45,318
Do I lie? No, but I can't
picture with words truth,

239
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:48,613
which is here, tangible,
like yolk in albumen,

240
00:49:48,863 --> 00:49:51,074
Like yolk in albumen!

241
00:49:51,366 --> 00:49:53,118
Girls, let's curtsy!

242
00:49:53,326 --> 00:49:55,245
Boys, do a quick bow,

243
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:59,249
Stamp your heels and smile
with grace and rudeness!

244
00:49:59,541 --> 00:50:03,253
Lower your discreet sights and fondle
your dream, the one about jungles,

245
00:50:03,461 --> 00:50:08,008
the sweetest dancers,
mysterious princes...

246
00:50:08,299 --> 00:50:11,594
Tear the murmuring silk
with your fingers,

247
00:50:11,845 --> 00:50:13,763
only slightly brushing
the shivering skin.

248
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:15,807
Remember it!

249
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:20,895
And when they'll ask you what are you
thinking about, reply: 'Nothing'."

250
00:50:21,938 --> 00:50:24,816
There's someone here!
-Is one of us.

251
00:50:25,066 --> 00:50:27,986
I had noticed it.
-It was Ljuska, the gardener.

252
00:50:28,236 --> 00:50:32,115
She always sent Mushka away,
I knew she was evil.

253
00:50:32,365 --> 00:50:36,286
When I get there I asked that couple.
And they saw a little black dog

254
00:50:36,536 --> 00:50:40,707
and they gave her a piece of bread.
They also proposed to catch her for us.

255
00:50:41,082 --> 00:50:44,461
I think I saw her.
But she wouldn't come close to me.

256
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:47,881
We should have reached an agreement
with the driver and pay him.

257
00:50:48,965 --> 00:50:52,344
I remember he talked
about that little town...

258
00:50:52,594 --> 00:50:54,679
Yes, it's true!

259
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:58,183
We should have looked for her!
-But there's the swamp.

260
00:50:58,475 --> 00:51:01,311
We just needed the right shoes.

261
00:51:01,561 --> 00:51:03,271
What did we know?
-All right, I understood.

262
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:07,442
We have to pay 5 rubles to the driver,

263
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:09,611
So he waits while we search.

264
00:51:09,861 --> 00:51:12,697
We should beat Ljuska
black and blue.

265
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:16,326
Once I even said to her:
"I hope you die!"

266
00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:19,454
She shot the cats
along with her friend!

267
00:51:19,746 --> 00:51:21,373
We should beat the hell out of her.
-We should ambush her.

268
00:51:37,598 --> 00:51:38,807
Good morning Irina Pavlovna.

269
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:40,684
Nikolaj Aleksejevich,
you're late.

270
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:43,896
I got sick in the subway,

271
00:51:44,563 --> 00:51:47,441
I couldn't breathe,
too many people.

272
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:49,151
Too many people?

273
00:51:49,902 --> 00:51:54,948
Do we have to deliver the pupils to your house?
You can punish them, if they don't come.

274
00:51:57,159 --> 00:52:00,787
Don't speak to me with that tone,
I'm not a student of yours.

275
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:03,248
And you shouldn't speak this way
even to your students.

276
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:08,086
You shouldn't use this tone.
-I shouldn't.

277
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:15,552
I've been working in
this school for 30 years,

278
00:52:15,677 --> 00:52:19,014
Do you think you can tell me
what I should do?

279
00:52:19,348 --> 00:52:20,557
Forget it!

280
00:52:22,017 --> 00:52:24,228
You think you can do that because
you're a friend of the principal?

281
00:52:24,853 --> 00:52:26,063
Forget it!

282
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:30,818
I'm the didactic director,
I'll made a report on your doings here!

283
00:52:31,193 --> 00:52:33,695
Don't you dare to rebuke me,

284
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:38,492
I have the intention to stay
in this school for 30 years too.

285
00:52:39,701 --> 00:52:43,205
Nikolaj Aleksejevich,
come back!

286
00:53:15,612 --> 00:53:17,406
You shouldn't do this Alekseev.

287
00:53:17,698 --> 00:53:19,575
Pick up that piece of paper.

288
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:27,207
Your underskirt peeps out.
-Where?

289
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:30,043
Oh, it's nothing!

290
00:54:14,379 --> 00:54:18,091
"I smell the
scream of the hay

291
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:20,469
Harvested in small yellow hills.

292
00:54:20,802 --> 00:54:22,679
Above the hills
and the windows,

293
00:54:23,931 --> 00:54:27,601
Below a weave of frames
and all kind of laces,

294
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:29,937
Proud stand the cats
on their throne.

295
00:54:30,395 --> 00:54:33,315
Oh, cats with the mustaches and the sideburns
and the tails winded around their bodies!

296
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:36,193
The hears, looking like a chimney top,
extend themselves,

297
00:54:36,485 --> 00:54:39,363
competing with the whiskers.

298
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:41,782
Oh, cats with your wonderful coats,

299
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:44,326
You are my forewarning vision!

300
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:47,204
I would have liked
to slide in their souls

301
00:54:47,663 --> 00:54:49,873
While they are purring.

302
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:52,376
How many vision it waves

303
00:54:52,793 --> 00:54:55,671
The gold of the river
ornated with silver sands!

304
00:55:09,643 --> 00:55:11,353
Nobody likes!"

305
00:55:12,271 --> 00:55:14,565
On the other hand the
father of my grandfather is from Riga,

306
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,943
Like his parents.

307
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:22,072
He graduated a gardening academy.

308
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:24,449
There were such academies.

309
00:55:24,783 --> 00:55:28,745
He left his parents
and moved to north Ukraine.

310
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:33,167
Traveling through the lands
of the land-owners,

311
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:35,586
he became an important person.

312
00:55:35,836 --> 00:55:38,922
If some land-owner
rebuked him about something,

313
00:55:39,214 --> 00:55:42,885
He went to work
in another place.

314
00:55:43,927 --> 00:55:48,473
They really valued him,
I still have the certificates of his merits.

315
00:55:50,243 --> 00:55:51,578
Love, my dear!

316
00:55:52,853 --> 00:55:56,064
Wonderful dog, my kittie!

317
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:58,567
What I would do without you?

318
00:55:58,859 --> 00:56:01,820
We really had enough of
that bastard, haven't we?

319
00:56:02,112 --> 00:56:03,864
What would I do without you?

320
00:56:04,156 --> 00:56:07,493
We really had enough of
that bastard, haven't we?

321
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:11,246
Yesterday he came home drunk,
and he was sure he is okay.

322
00:56:11,497 --> 00:56:13,832
Probably he went out philandering!

323
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:16,835
Life is not like that!

324
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:20,172
We've really had
enough, my dear.

325
00:56:20,589 --> 00:56:22,591
What would I do without you?

326
00:56:22,883 --> 00:56:25,969
We've really really really
had enough of that bastard.

327
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:32,643
Don't go too far!

328
00:56:47,066 --> 00:56:49,027
They killed Kolja!

329
00:56:53,656 --> 00:56:55,241
Fish!

330
00:56:55,658 --> 00:56:57,452
Fish at good prices!

331
00:56:58,745 --> 00:57:00,580
They killed him,

332
00:57:00,913 --> 00:57:02,457
understand?

333
00:57:03,624 --> 00:57:07,378
Some bastards assaulted him
while he was taking home Ninka.

334
00:57:07,754 --> 00:57:09,297
Bastards,

335
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:11,382
We should hang them all!

336
00:57:11,758 --> 00:57:13,426
We have to do something!

337
00:57:13,676 --> 00:57:15,636
Let's go to Misha,
he still doesn't know about it!

338
00:57:16,679 --> 00:57:19,307
They killed Kolja,
do you understand?

339
00:57:20,224 --> 00:57:23,603
Stop it!
-The bastards attacked him!

340
00:57:23,936 --> 00:57:25,605
Let's go.

341
00:57:26,314 --> 00:57:30,151
What can we do about it Serjoga?
It's all useless by now!

342
00:57:30,735 --> 00:57:32,737
Stop it.
-Wait!

343
00:57:33,154 --> 00:57:35,531
They killed Kolja!

344
00:57:36,491 --> 00:57:38,868
They killed him,
do you understand?

345
00:57:39,744 --> 00:57:41,621
Sorry, we're in a hurry.

346
00:57:41,954 --> 00:57:44,290
Tonight I'll come to your place!

347
00:57:51,005 --> 00:57:52,632
Look, they sell chickens.

348
00:57:53,299 --> 00:57:54,926
Good afternoon.

349
00:57:58,554 --> 00:58:01,432
"I want to tell you a secret.

350
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:05,436
I'm barely make a living,
I don't wait for any good from life.

351
00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:09,107
While was Stalin,
life was wonderful,

352
00:58:09,399 --> 00:58:12,235
He's made lighter
the workmen's burden!"

353
00:58:12,735 --> 00:58:14,445
Is Misha at home?

354
00:58:14,946 --> 00:58:17,365
I'm asking to you if Misha is at home!

355
00:58:26,124 --> 00:58:28,418
First of all good afternoon.

356
00:58:28,793 --> 00:58:30,211
Good afternoon! Good afternoon!

357
00:58:31,129 --> 00:58:33,005
Is Misha at home?

358
00:58:36,092 --> 00:58:38,344
Why are you so pale?

359
00:58:38,636 --> 00:58:40,471
Is Misha at home?

360
00:58:40,763 --> 00:58:43,057
He went to a birthday.

361
00:58:43,933 --> 00:58:45,685
Goodbye.

362
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,735
Misha told me Kolja is killed.

363
00:58:54,527 --> 00:58:56,487
How did it happen?

364
00:58:56,779 --> 00:58:58,740
So, does he know?

365
00:58:59,032 --> 00:59:01,451
He told me, but I...

366
00:59:02,785 --> 00:59:04,704
understood nothing of it!

367
00:59:05,204 --> 00:59:08,750
You know Misha is not good
at telling stories.

368
00:59:10,126 --> 00:59:12,920
How did it happen?

369
00:59:16,591 --> 00:59:20,094
I don't agree with you!
-Wait!

370
00:59:21,054 --> 00:59:24,474
Come in and take a look
at the conditions we live in.

371
00:59:25,058 --> 00:59:28,227
Three of us have to use a
bucket for their needs.

372
00:59:28,644 --> 00:59:30,563
It's all broken,

373
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:33,858
There's no kitchen,
neither with gas or whatever,

374
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:37,278
There's no water and the ceiling
is falling over our heads.

375
00:59:37,612 --> 00:59:40,656
We asked for help,
but nobody is listening.

376
00:59:40,948 --> 00:59:44,994
We were at the ninth place in the housings list,
then my mother died

377
00:59:45,286 --> 00:59:49,916
and we are not counted as a family
of a victim of war any more.

378
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:56,297
Now we are at the 493rd place,
do we have to wait so long?

379
00:59:56,964 --> 01:00:00,760
Mother died and still
has to pay for refrigerator,

380
01:00:01,052 --> 01:00:03,304
So we have to shell out
363 rubles now.

381
01:00:03,554 --> 01:00:06,140
Where's justice?
What have we to do?

382
01:00:06,391 --> 01:00:08,601
You just come to harass us.

383
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:12,647
You come in, scribble some notes...
but how we are supposed to live?

384
01:00:13,606 --> 01:00:16,317
Desire for universal love

385
01:00:16,776 --> 01:00:19,487
Is innate in man.

386
01:00:21,072 --> 01:00:22,990
Who sent you?

387
01:00:23,282 --> 01:00:26,411
The city council?
-No!

388
01:00:26,703 --> 01:00:28,162
What happens?

389
01:00:28,371 --> 01:00:32,125
Human beings always dreamt
about happiness for all...

390
01:00:33,334 --> 01:00:35,836
Where's your justice?

391
01:00:36,086 --> 01:00:38,255
Where do we live?

392
01:00:39,506 --> 01:00:41,592
I know I'm right,

393
01:00:41,842 --> 01:00:45,179
I fought in war,
I've spilt my blood!

394
01:00:45,763 --> 01:00:47,848
What is happening?

395
01:00:48,098 --> 01:00:50,768
You don't wish bad luck
to anybody, do you?

396
01:00:51,018 --> 01:00:53,604
Universal love will never exist,

397
01:00:53,854 --> 01:00:57,775
There always will be someone I don't like
or who doesn't like me.

398
01:00:58,025 --> 01:01:00,194
If someone offends me,

399
01:01:00,444 --> 01:01:02,613
Why shouldn't I hit him?

400
01:01:03,447 --> 01:01:07,910
But on a more general level,
there'll be people...

401
01:01:08,244 --> 01:01:10,913
We should fight against
these very people!

402
01:01:11,205 --> 01:01:14,333
So the universal love?
-We won't fight with your methods.

403
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:19,380
We won't educate man with fear,
cutting his hands, whipping him.

404
01:01:19,713 --> 01:01:22,216
Human beings have a soul!

405
01:01:22,842 --> 01:01:25,052
We will educate the soul.

406
01:01:25,302 --> 01:01:28,264
But sometime you have
to cut some hands.

407
01:01:30,891 --> 01:01:34,812
You have to educate the soul!
-And sometime cut some hands.

408
01:01:35,104 --> 01:01:39,024
The soul will be educated.
-Sometime the hands will be cut.

409
01:01:39,817 --> 01:01:44,196
We need to educate the soul.
-And cut some hands.

410
01:02:04,133 --> 01:02:07,553
Don't push!
-Everyone's going crazy!

411
01:02:08,345 --> 01:02:11,015
Stop pushing!
-It's enough for everyone!

412
01:02:12,099 --> 01:02:14,018
Off your hands!

413
01:02:14,977 --> 01:02:16,729
Give me the fish.

414
01:02:17,438 --> 01:02:19,190
Give it to me!

415
01:02:21,901 --> 01:02:23,611
Here's your change.

416
01:02:23,861 --> 01:02:25,529
Me too!

417
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:32,036
Off your hands.

418
01:02:34,455 --> 01:02:36,332
That one.

419
01:02:37,166 --> 01:02:39,376
So, what's up?

420
01:02:40,544 --> 01:02:42,546
Give me a good one.

421
01:02:43,214 --> 01:02:45,007
Go away!

422
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,888
Don't push!

423
01:02:54,266 --> 01:02:56,101
I have enough of you!

424
01:02:56,477 --> 01:02:58,020
How much?

425
01:03:08,531 --> 01:03:10,491
Don't give anything to him!

426
01:03:11,825 --> 01:03:13,911
It wasn't his turn!

427
01:03:34,723 --> 01:03:35,766
Move on!

428
01:03:37,184 --> 01:03:38,602
Lady,

429
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,397
This fish is dirty!

430
01:03:41,981 --> 01:03:45,442
It's dirty indeed!
-You can wash it at home.

431
01:03:46,819 --> 01:03:49,572
I don't have running water at home.

432
01:03:52,867 --> 01:03:54,743
Don't push!

433
01:04:19,111 --> 01:04:20,070
A trick.

434
01:04:20,445 --> 01:04:22,614
The ball is here, and it isn't...

435
01:04:24,074 --> 01:04:25,367
Where's the ball?

436
01:04:29,121 --> 01:04:33,125
"Our school had a very
successful development."

437
01:04:35,701 --> 01:04:38,495
You know what?
I love dogs.

438
01:04:39,288 --> 01:04:42,208
One day it came to my ears

439
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:44,793
The dog of a friend of mine
is about to give birth

440
01:04:46,629 --> 01:04:48,881
And I book for a pup.

441
01:04:49,256 --> 01:04:53,302
She says:
"Sure, I'd love to give you a pup."

442
01:04:53,677 --> 01:04:56,889
They were so cute!

443
01:04:57,223 --> 01:04:59,683
One was all black.

444
01:04:59,934 --> 01:05:01,477
So lovely!

445
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:05,940
I ask her for that,
she says: "He's yours."

446
01:05:06,398 --> 01:05:09,276
In the meantime I brought
him some delicacies,

447
01:05:10,945 --> 01:05:13,531
And also bought
him a feeding bottle.

448
01:05:14,448 --> 01:05:20,120
And when the pup
is big enough,

449
01:05:21,247 --> 01:05:27,920
She says: "You know I've been
offered 30 rubles for that pup?"

450
01:05:30,631 --> 01:05:34,635
When she said that
I really felt bad.

451
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:38,597
I said: "No, thanks.

452
01:05:39,014 --> 01:05:41,267
I don't have 30 rubles.

453
01:05:42,226 --> 01:05:47,523
And I don't want your
little dog any more!"

454
01:05:50,651 --> 01:05:54,321
High school in
our country is free,

455
01:05:55,531 --> 01:05:56,740
compulsory

456
01:05:57,491 --> 01:05:59,243
and universal.

457
01:08:13,402 --> 01:08:16,163
The idea that all men are brothers
is foreign to the bourgeois,

458
01:08:16,563 --> 01:08:19,742
But this doesn't mean
he's against friendship.

459
01:08:20,451 --> 01:08:23,329
He may be friendly
toward his neighbor,

460
01:08:23,704 --> 01:08:27,750
If that doesn't compromise
his wellbeing and serenity.

461
01:08:29,043 --> 01:08:32,505
The principal trait of the
bourgeois is indifference

462
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,133
to public interests,
towards his fellows...

463
01:08:37,067 --> 01:08:41,154
Unfortunately this indifference
seeps also into the best hearts.

464
01:08:42,322 --> 01:08:47,035
Even more than indifference,
the individual's habit to stay in the corner.

465
01:08:47,577 --> 01:08:49,830
Often indeed we stay in the corner

466
01:08:50,122 --> 01:08:54,167
Because to help someone
may result in personal harm.

467
01:09:06,555 --> 01:09:11,309
That vile attitude has to be
definitely eradicated.

468
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:16,106
An individual should be like a sun,
keeping warm those around.

469
01:09:16,606 --> 01:09:20,610
Ivnikov, what are you looking
that's so interesting?

470
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:24,823
I'm counting the bourgeoises.
-Get up!

471
01:09:26,908 --> 01:09:30,370
Here are your mates too,
you should respect them.

472
01:09:30,746 --> 01:09:33,206
Respect is a feeling,
not a duty.

473
01:09:33,665 --> 01:09:35,000
Get up.

474
01:09:35,292 --> 01:09:36,752
You already are.

475
01:09:37,044 --> 01:09:40,756
Why do you always chew
something at the lesson?

476
01:09:41,089 --> 01:09:42,632
Why?

477
01:09:42,924 --> 01:09:46,720
Why don't you tell me
what you think about me?

478
01:09:47,804 --> 01:09:49,306
Masha! I know your book is
more interesting than the lesson,

479
01:09:54,853 --> 01:09:58,607
but the exam
will be on other topic.

480
01:09:58,899 --> 01:10:00,650
Masha knows that this book is more
interesting than the lesson.

481
01:10:01,451 --> 01:10:05,038
The teacher is not pleased

482
01:10:05,664 --> 01:10:07,707
That they will ask about this topic.

483
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:09,876
But he couldn't run away.

484
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:12,379
But Masha knows it by heart.
-Yes.

485
01:10:12,712 --> 01:10:15,924
"If, after completing the school,

486
01:10:16,299 --> 01:10:18,551
the pupil will want...

487
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:20,929
Better to write it down,
It will be easier

488
01:10:21,304 --> 01:10:23,723
To memorize.

489
01:10:24,724 --> 01:10:28,812
"If, after completing the school,
the pupil will want to go on with the studies,

490
01:10:29,145 --> 01:10:33,650
it would be better to try
a real job beforehand.

491
01:10:35,026 --> 01:10:38,822
You have all the time to think
about your future!

492
01:10:39,864 --> 01:10:42,367
if you enroll to university

493
01:10:42,701 --> 01:10:45,203
you'll know life in a deeper way."

494
01:10:46,454 --> 01:10:48,581
Good, but I can't let you out.

495
01:10:48,873 --> 01:10:52,419
If the didactic director finds out,
it will be troubles for us all.

496
01:10:52,877 --> 01:10:54,921
Let me read you something.

497
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:02,387
What do
I have to do?

498
01:11:03,054 --> 01:11:04,889
I want to know what
you think about it.

499
01:11:05,265 --> 01:11:09,185
Who will give me a hint?
I want your opinion.

500
01:11:09,602 --> 01:11:13,315
"Studying is light, smoke is wreck,
doubts are delirium."

501
01:11:13,982 --> 01:11:16,943
Anyone else? Ivnikov!

502
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,119
He snatched a girl's bag,

503
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:31,166
but he couldn't run away.

504
01:11:33,126 --> 01:11:35,712
Why do you stay silent?

505
01:11:36,046 --> 01:11:38,965
Why don't you write anything?
Do you think you already know it all?

506
01:11:39,341 --> 01:11:41,968
Why don't you take notes?
-I don't feel like.

507
01:11:42,302 --> 01:11:45,138
Why are you here so?
-None of your business.

508
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:49,351
Go away, you're interrupting
the lesson. -Leave me alone.

509
01:11:53,229 --> 01:11:55,106
I don't like to mess with it!

510
01:11:56,399 --> 01:11:58,234
What a horror!

511
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:06,076
Terrible!

512
01:12:06,409 --> 01:12:08,161
Crazy!

513
01:12:22,967 --> 01:12:24,761
The A B C of good manners!

514
01:12:25,303 --> 01:12:27,639
"A, B... C, D, E..."

515
01:12:50,161 --> 01:12:53,081
Do you want to say something, Masha?
-We want to dictate.

516
01:12:53,623 --> 01:12:54,874
OK.

517
01:12:55,959 --> 01:12:59,462
"Our school achieved great
success in its development.

518
01:13:00,005 --> 01:13:03,425
High school in our country is free,
mandatory for all.

519
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,136
Those who graduate will be
able to do anything,

520
01:13:06,594 --> 01:13:10,348
Enroll into professional or
technical schools or into university.

521
01:13:10,682 --> 01:13:13,643
Those who graduate will be
able to do anything,

522
01:13:13,935 --> 01:13:16,855
Enroll into professional or
technical schools or in university.

523
01:13:17,147 --> 01:13:19,774
If after completing the school the pupil
will want to go on with the studies,

524
01:13:20,066 --> 01:13:22,569
it would be better to..."

525
01:13:23,611 --> 01:13:27,449
Don't make noise
the next 5 minutes.

526
01:13:28,325 --> 01:13:32,370
You have all the time
to think about your future!

527
01:13:33,497 --> 01:13:37,793
Comrades, you're watching
the TV program "This amazing reality."

528
01:13:40,212 --> 01:13:42,256
Good morning comrades.

529
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:46,718
We've shown you the documentary
"The mystery of the egg and the chicken",

530
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:50,472
Which deeply moved our audience.

531
01:13:50,848 --> 01:13:52,558
We've been flooded by letters...

532
01:13:53,016 --> 01:13:55,185
Come here, please!

533
01:13:55,519 --> 01:13:57,104
Come here you all.

534
01:13:57,437 --> 01:13:59,481
Don't be afraid to come closer.

535
01:14:00,232 --> 01:14:03,402
Eat, food is good.

536
01:14:03,777 --> 01:14:05,529
Come!

537
01:14:05,988 --> 01:14:07,990
Is very good.

538
01:14:10,909 --> 01:14:13,537
Come and don't push.

539
01:14:22,129 --> 01:14:24,590
What a bad aunt,

540
01:14:24,965 --> 01:14:26,884
She cheats the little ones!

541
01:14:27,718 --> 01:14:29,595
Give it back to me, auntie!

542
01:14:30,429 --> 01:14:32,431
Good Misha.

543
01:14:32,806 --> 01:14:34,308
Take it.

544
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:37,978
Go, take it.

545
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,816
You're evil!

546
01:14:44,943 --> 01:14:47,321
Beautiful shoe!

547
01:14:48,113 --> 01:14:50,491
You're dirt behind your knee.

548
01:14:50,782 --> 01:14:52,534
It stinks.

549
01:14:53,827 --> 01:14:56,455
Let's go!
-What are you doing?

550
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:03,086
I'm tired.

551
01:15:04,296 --> 01:15:06,256
You're evil!

552
01:15:10,552 --> 01:15:12,221
Leave him alone.

553
01:15:12,596 --> 01:15:15,641
Stop, he's sick.
-You are!

554
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:21,063
Stop!

555
01:15:22,564 --> 01:15:24,274
Stop it!

556
01:15:30,322 --> 01:15:31,740
Help!

557
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:33,575
Bad girls!

558
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,126
Help!

559
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:47,339
I'll kill you!

560
01:15:48,715 --> 01:15:50,551
You filth!

561
01:15:51,718 --> 01:15:53,053
Go away!

562
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:55,305
Stop it, shut up!

563
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:57,683
Shut up, you wretch!

564
01:15:58,392 --> 01:16:00,894
Go away!

565
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,021
Goat!

566
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:48,358
Let's play.

567
01:17:01,455 --> 01:17:03,248
They went away,

568
01:17:03,749 --> 01:17:05,417
It's all right.

569
01:17:10,923 --> 01:17:12,549
Write, good boy.

570
01:17:13,342 --> 01:17:14,510
Here.

571
01:17:14,927 --> 01:17:18,055
You're a kind person.
-You need 100% of presences?

572
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:20,349
You misunderstood me!

573
01:17:29,483 --> 01:17:30,400
Beautiful!

574
01:17:31,944 --> 01:17:33,779
He misunderstood.

575
01:17:41,245 --> 01:17:45,332
"I cannot sit, I cannot stand,
I can but hang myself!"

576
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:48,168
Nobody understands me,

577
01:17:48,502 --> 01:17:50,504
Can you tell me why?

578
01:17:51,129 --> 01:17:54,508
I don't drink.
-Can you tell me why?

579
01:18:05,519 --> 01:18:07,229
Put it in its place.

580
01:18:10,315 --> 01:18:12,359
Here's my little ones!

581
01:18:57,446 --> 01:18:58,655
Here's to you.

582
01:18:59,948 --> 01:19:01,450
Thanks, daddy.

583
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:35,586
Lower the volume!

584
01:20:48,849 --> 01:20:50,809
You filthy!

585
01:20:52,394 --> 01:20:54,021
You wretch!

586
01:20:58,066 --> 01:20:59,776
Dirty beast!

587
01:21:05,491 --> 01:21:07,493
Where do you think you're going?
Come here.

588
01:21:08,994 --> 01:21:10,996
You can't hide.

589
01:21:17,753 --> 01:21:19,546
Stop it daddy!

590
01:21:20,255 --> 01:21:21,590
Go away!

591
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:28,972
How dare you?

592
01:21:44,404 --> 01:21:46,448
You're filth!

593
01:21:48,951 --> 01:21:50,619
Wretch!

594
01:22:21,159 --> 01:22:23,244
I hope you hurt yourself.

595
01:22:24,078 --> 01:22:28,583
So maybe you'll finally fix that.
-Good afternoon, Galina Vladimirovna!

596
01:22:28,958 --> 01:22:32,211
You just woke up?
And where did you sleep?

597
01:22:32,545 --> 01:22:34,046
Good morning!

598
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:36,674
Good evening.
-As you like it.

599
01:22:36,966 --> 01:22:40,178
Do you want to eat something?
-I don't feel like it.

600
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:44,098
Meatballs are ready,
you just have to fry them.

601
01:22:44,348 --> 01:22:47,643
No, just a cup of coffee.

602
01:22:47,894 --> 01:22:51,814
Sure, to fry meatballs
is a woman's chore.

603
01:22:52,315 --> 01:22:54,567
Anechka is busier than you.

604
01:22:54,817 --> 01:22:57,487
Why you neglect your man's chores?

605
01:22:57,737 --> 01:23:00,698
Or it is our task to fix
the pavement too?

606
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:04,660
Why you're trying so hard
to be a typical mother-in-law?

607
01:23:06,078 --> 01:23:10,666
I don't want to,
you make me do it.

608
01:23:11,209 --> 01:23:16,172
I swear, in a week I'll bring
a squad of carpenters,

609
01:23:17,256 --> 01:23:21,886
But please don't
annoy me these days,

610
01:23:22,595 --> 01:23:25,097
I asked for a week off work,
without pay.

611
01:23:25,389 --> 01:23:28,184
What are you saying?
Who will bring home the money?

612
01:23:28,643 --> 01:23:32,814
These holidays of yours will be
on my and Anechka's pockets.

613
01:23:33,147 --> 01:23:35,191
I just want to work
without disturbances.

614
01:23:35,483 --> 01:23:39,028
I have never the time
to do anything.

615
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:44,325
How much is it
for a week of tranquility?

616
01:23:44,742 --> 01:23:48,329
I'll pay it to you.
Otherwise I won't write a word.

617
01:23:48,663 --> 01:23:51,332
This is not the meatballs.
-Hear this.

618
01:23:52,166 --> 01:23:53,543
"I feel my limits,

619
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:57,088
I see where my goodness
stops and I become a beast,

620
01:23:57,421 --> 01:23:59,465
Where I shut my eyes
so I won't see...

621
01:23:59,799 --> 01:24:02,009
Where I don't want to understand,
where I shut my eyes not to see.

622
01:24:06,722 --> 01:24:11,519
Money, rage and intolerance have
power on me as on the meanest of men.

623
01:24:12,103 --> 01:24:13,646
They sat on the two
sides of a long table,

624
01:24:15,273 --> 01:24:19,277
Eyes fixed on
the television's glittering.

625
01:24:19,569 --> 01:24:22,947
She munched on nothing,
moving her jaw right to left

626
01:24:23,531 --> 01:24:26,409
not knowing how she's sickening,

627
01:24:27,201 --> 01:24:29,287
Like he who can't keep
his saliva in his mouth

628
01:24:29,537 --> 01:24:32,081
Or who scratch off the dirt
between his feet's toes.

629
01:24:32,373 --> 01:24:36,210
He didn't shave beard,
and it was as soft as jelly.

630
01:24:36,502 --> 01:24:37,503
Mother and father.

631
01:24:38,087 --> 01:24:41,340
You could touch their old age!

632
01:24:41,883 --> 01:24:43,801
It has its smell, you felt it.

633
01:24:44,802 --> 01:24:47,680
It was the most tangible
thing in that room.

634
01:24:51,476 --> 01:24:53,060
I hated old age.

635
01:24:53,811 --> 01:24:57,190
In them I saw just this.

636
01:24:57,774 --> 01:24:59,692
I hated them for being my parents

637
01:25:00,318 --> 01:25:02,278
And I hated myself for that hate.

638
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:06,073
I was sick to see that my
habits are  my father's ones

639
01:25:06,365 --> 01:25:10,119
And I hated him for it, because
I would have aged just like him,

640
01:25:11,287 --> 01:25:13,539
Because of the shame
for these thoughts.

641
01:25:14,123 --> 01:25:18,419
And it was infinitely multiplying itself,
like a reflection between two mirrors.

642
01:25:18,669 --> 01:25:20,963
A neverending tunnel of hate.

643
01:25:21,464 --> 01:25:23,758
Wall made of hate
and pavement made of hate.

644
01:25:24,425 --> 01:25:29,138
Hate mixed with disgust, shame,

645
01:25:29,889 --> 01:25:32,183
Weakness.

646
01:25:33,476 --> 01:25:35,144
One way out led to cruelty,

647
01:25:35,603 --> 01:25:38,773
the other to reserve,
that is lower your eyes

648
01:25:40,149 --> 01:25:42,777
because you can't mask
their instinctive look.

649
01:25:43,903 --> 01:25:46,823
It is the silence
similar to severed fingers

650
01:25:47,323 --> 01:25:50,243
of the man clutching to the boat
trying not to drown..."

651
01:25:50,368 --> 01:25:52,078
Do you like it?
-Yes.

652
01:25:52,995 --> 01:25:54,747
Is it a novel?
-Or a short story.

653
01:25:56,749 --> 01:26:01,546
Anyway, you have to hurry
if you want to make some money.

654
01:26:01,879 --> 01:26:04,799
Like your friend Serjozha. He's
already member of Writers Guild.

655
01:26:05,299 --> 01:26:07,385
I don't understand,
can you explain?

656
01:26:09,053 --> 01:26:11,681
Your parents are good people,

657
01:26:12,098 --> 01:26:14,016
Where this millioner's
craze came from?

658
01:26:15,268 --> 01:26:17,145
And about your novel,
you still have to write it.

659
01:26:19,772 --> 01:26:23,568
Writers lead a humble life,
they're not so rich.

660
01:26:24,235 --> 01:26:27,029
To be rich you have to save.

661
01:26:27,947 --> 01:26:30,032
Don't drink coffee 180 times
a days in such big cups.

662
01:26:36,956 --> 01:26:38,458
I'll fry the meatballs,
take the pan.

663
01:26:41,085 --> 01:26:42,712
Where are you going?

664
01:26:49,427 --> 01:26:51,095
Where are you going?

665
01:26:56,434 --> 01:26:58,770
Can I have some caviar?

666
01:27:00,021 --> 01:27:01,564
-If you want to.

667
01:29:03,728 --> 01:29:05,689
Open the third can.

668
01:29:24,249 --> 01:29:26,960
Kolja, my love, you
finished all my mother's supply!

669
01:29:27,294 --> 01:29:31,298
There's a lot of vitamins in caviar,
doctor says I need them.

670
01:29:32,382 --> 01:29:33,842
What's up?

671
01:29:34,259 --> 01:29:37,304
What's more important to you,
caviar or my health?

672
01:29:37,595 --> 01:29:40,599
You still have not finished
the second can.

673
01:29:40,932 --> 01:29:42,892
Open it, please.

674
01:29:46,813 --> 01:29:48,940
Mom, we are hungry as wolves!

675
01:29:49,441 --> 01:29:51,985
Kolja, did you eat all caviar?

676
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:55,864
Sorry, we have
reduced your supply.

677
01:29:57,198 --> 01:30:01,161
She said I can eat.
-I thought you would eat just a little!

678
01:30:01,494 --> 01:30:03,830
Anyway its "best before"
was two months ago.

679
01:30:04,914 --> 01:30:09,127
I just want to be sure you
won't have to beg when I'm dead.

680
01:30:09,461 --> 01:30:11,963
Let me die in peace!

681
01:30:12,547 --> 01:30:13,965
Don't say so.

682
01:30:14,257 --> 01:30:15,800
Don't worry,

683
01:30:16,051 --> 01:30:20,555
When you're dead,
you won't care if we beg.

684
01:30:21,681 --> 01:30:25,352
We will die too,
it's not your privilege.

685
01:30:25,977 --> 01:30:28,188
It's trivial, but
it's not clear to me.

686
01:30:28,521 --> 01:30:31,316
I should study, learn wisdom

687
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:34,694
Then just to accumulate
honours and wealth?

688
01:30:35,028 --> 01:30:38,990
So I would be better off going
to sleep now, never to awake again.

689
01:30:39,699 --> 01:30:43,870
Not even your daughter understands you.
-What's so difficult to understand in me?

690
01:30:44,245 --> 01:30:48,124
Your incommunicability.
There's a joke about it.

691
01:30:48,833 --> 01:30:51,711
Incommunicability,
communicability in common,

692
01:30:52,045 --> 01:30:54,381
Not a common ability...

693
01:30:54,881 --> 01:30:58,343
I have insomnia.
-Really?

694
01:30:59,719 --> 01:31:01,846
What a symmetry!

695
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:05,100
When you'll die, we'll be alive.
-I know.

696
01:31:05,809 --> 01:31:08,186
Where's the box that was up there?

697
01:31:08,561 --> 01:31:10,397
It's on its place, can't you see?

698
01:31:10,689 --> 01:31:12,274
Are you blind?

699
01:31:14,067 --> 01:31:16,778
I thought you asked days off
so you could write.

700
01:31:17,070 --> 01:31:19,155
Why you're doing nothing?

701
01:31:20,824 --> 01:31:22,993
Thanks your mother!

702
01:31:23,285 --> 01:31:25,996
I can't work like that.

703
01:31:26,871 --> 01:31:30,625
When talent is missing,
one worries about conditions.

704
01:31:30,917 --> 01:31:34,254
Some people worked
in worse conditions!

705
01:31:55,483 --> 01:31:57,652
My love, everything's
going to be alright.

706
01:31:58,278 --> 01:32:00,363
We'll never quarrel again,
won't we?

707
01:32:02,574 --> 01:32:04,701
I'm not asking too much, I think,

708
01:32:05,076 --> 01:32:07,495
just some tenderness.

709
01:32:08,163 --> 01:32:10,165
Call me Anechka.

710
01:32:10,749 --> 01:32:13,251
Come on, call me Anechka!

711
01:32:16,713 --> 01:32:17,589
Anechka.

712
01:32:20,133 --> 01:32:23,553
Don't get angry with my mother,
she's such a good woman.

713
01:32:23,887 --> 01:32:27,474
I'll do anything for you,
I'll cook and I'll iron your shirts,

714
01:32:28,016 --> 01:32:31,519
while you'll be writing a long novel,
or a shorter one...

715
01:32:33,271 --> 01:32:35,023
A poem,

716
01:32:35,815 --> 01:32:37,359
a short story...

717
01:32:40,528 --> 01:32:42,280
or something else.

718
01:36:05,275 --> 01:36:07,319
Damned stinking cats!

719
01:36:07,611 --> 01:36:11,323
At their leisure,
and they're not even ashamed of it!

720
01:36:11,698 --> 01:36:15,410
I really don't know what
to do with these cats!

721
01:36:22,334 --> 01:36:24,294
Stupid stinking cats!

722
01:36:24,628 --> 01:36:28,673
Easy life, and they're
not even ashamed of it!

723
01:36:29,966 --> 01:36:32,260
Stupid cats!

724
01:36:33,011 --> 01:36:35,180
Are you at home?
Why so early?

725
01:36:38,725 --> 01:36:42,646
If I had come later, you
would have said "Why so late?"

726
01:36:43,229 --> 01:36:45,482
That you're smart,
I already knew that.

727
01:36:55,075 --> 01:36:56,868
What did you say?

728
01:36:57,702 --> 01:36:59,579
I know you're quite bright!

729
01:37:24,479 --> 01:37:26,606
Are you hungry?
-No.

730
01:37:27,023 --> 01:37:27,983
I'm going to warm up
something for you.

731
01:37:28,483 --> 01:37:29,192
I don't feel like it!

732
01:38:22,454 --> 01:38:24,414
I can't remember...

733
01:38:22,662 --> 01:38:24,748
Where have I put down the bags?

734
01:38:27,208 --> 01:38:28,918
Come on, dinner is ready.

735
01:38:33,089 --> 01:38:35,258
Egoist!

736
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:45,852
Have something to eat.
-I don't feel like it.

737
01:38:46,061 --> 01:38:49,022
Come on.
-I don't feel like it.

738
01:38:49,272 --> 01:38:51,399
So who have I cooked for?
-I'm not hungry.

739
01:38:52,817 --> 01:38:54,694
Why do you make a fool of me?

740
01:38:55,278 --> 01:38:56,780
I don't feel like it.

741
01:38:57,656 --> 01:39:00,533
Mom, who's Shakespeare?
-What?

742
01:39:03,787 --> 01:39:05,747
Who's Shakespeare?

743
01:39:08,708 --> 01:39:11,002
What does it matter?
We're not at school.

744
01:39:12,545 --> 01:39:14,714
Once upon a time there was a woman

745
01:39:15,006 --> 01:39:17,634
and all she needed in her life
was piece of bread.

746
01:39:19,344 --> 01:39:22,847
She lived her life and then...
quick into the grave!

747
01:39:33,191 --> 01:39:35,318
Hit me on my shoulders!

748
01:39:37,237 --> 01:39:39,447
Do you love me?
-Yes,  and so?

749
01:39:40,323 --> 01:39:41,157
I'm happy.

750
01:39:42,742 --> 01:39:44,744
Don't look at me!
-Why, do you feel like crying?

751
01:39:45,078 --> 01:39:46,830
Go to hell!
-OK, I'm going.

752
01:39:48,456 --> 01:39:50,125
Where are you going?
-To hell.

753
01:39:50,583 --> 01:39:55,005
I was only joke.
-Me too, I'll take a stroll.

754
01:39:55,422 --> 01:39:57,674
Don't get into fights
with anyone. -I won't.

755
01:40:03,805 --> 01:40:06,975
I almost forgot,
I bought your mouthpiece.

756
01:45:01,916 --> 01:45:04,377
Put this hat on.
-Pass it to me.

757
01:45:05,377 --> 01:45:06,545
Look. How do I look?

758
01:45:15,429 --> 01:45:17,473
Relax, take it easy.

759
01:45:20,893 --> 01:45:22,853
Keep your head this way.

760
01:45:42,105 --> 01:45:43,898
I can't see myself.

761
01:45:44,565 --> 01:45:47,360
Relax and look at the mirror.
-This way?

762
01:45:47,735 --> 01:45:49,904
All that matters is
if I can see you.

763
01:45:50,363 --> 01:45:52,657
Don't look at me, look at her.

764
01:45:53,324 --> 01:45:54,951
Here, perfect!

765
01:47:14,091 --> 01:47:15,342
Masha!

766
01:47:15,676 --> 01:47:17,428
What are you doing here?

767
01:47:17,761 --> 01:47:19,596
Where's my sister?

768
01:47:46,749 --> 01:47:47,916
Wonderful,
just wonderful.

769
01:47:48,167 --> 01:47:49,752
Don't move the curtain!
-Who is it?

770
01:47:50,085 --> 01:47:52,629
We're playing here,
close the curtain!

771
01:47:56,175 --> 01:47:58,177
Show us your ID.

772
01:47:58,469 --> 01:48:00,304
Will you play, little brother?

773
01:48:00,596 --> 01:48:02,514
Pasha, tell him
the rules of the game.

774
01:48:03,015 --> 01:48:05,184
We're creating a sculpture of love.
They are the raw materials.

775
01:48:05,434 --> 01:48:08,979
You can use whatever materials,
and do whatever you like.

776
01:48:09,855 --> 01:48:13,984
This material is already taken.

777
01:48:14,318 --> 01:48:16,612
They're free,
you can use them as models.

778
01:48:17,196 --> 01:48:20,741
Will we finish the scene today?

779
01:48:21,241 --> 01:48:23,535
You're a bore!
Is it a fault of that witch of yours?

780
01:48:23,994 --> 01:48:26,955
What  did you think?
To marry the first one yo meet?

781
01:48:27,247 --> 01:48:31,168
Can I give you an advice?

782
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:33,629
You'll give it to him later, my feet
are freezing. -Let me warm you up!

783
01:48:33,879 --> 01:48:36,965
Get dressed.

784
01:48:37,257 --> 01:48:39,093
Hurry up.
-Undress, get dressed again...

785
01:48:39,385 --> 01:48:42,596
What a bore!

786
01:48:43,138 --> 01:48:45,182
Lay with your bellies up,

787
01:48:45,599 --> 01:48:47,851
your hands on your breasts.

788
01:48:48,227 --> 01:48:50,270
Give them two candles.

789
01:48:51,647 --> 01:48:53,816
They should be in the kitchen,
if Julia hasn't used them all.

790
01:48:54,149 --> 01:48:56,944
What a happy sculpture!

791
01:48:57,277 --> 01:48:59,446
Is he your brother?
-He's an aesthete, a decadent.

792
01:49:00,698 --> 01:49:03,701
He's a teacher!

793
01:49:03,951 --> 01:49:05,786
I would call it "the end of a love".
-This love can go to hell!

794
01:49:08,247 --> 01:49:12,292
Take her place.

795
01:49:12,668 --> 01:49:14,461
Get up.

796
01:49:18,382 --> 01:49:20,092
He always wanted
to stand out of crowd.

797
01:49:20,676 --> 01:49:21,635
If you could know for how long
I dreamed to lay down here,

798
01:49:21,969 --> 01:49:24,847
On our parents' bed!

799
01:49:25,180 --> 01:49:27,641
So soft, warm and quiet.

800
01:49:31,478 --> 01:49:34,565
I had enough of this!

801
01:49:35,274 --> 01:49:38,277
Let's go away.

802
01:49:39,069 --> 01:49:40,571
Sentimentality!
-I think it's not bad.

803
01:49:46,118 --> 01:49:49,747
Take my hand.
-Are we going away?

804
01:49:53,401 --> 01:49:56,028
I'm playing too!

805
01:49:56,279 --> 01:49:58,364
You're not funny.
-Go to hell!

806
01:49:58,656 --> 01:50:00,825
You know the rules.
-Explain them to me again.

807
01:50:01,075 --> 01:50:04,078
You have to make
a sculpture of love.

808
01:50:04,370 --> 01:50:06,914
A celebration of the human body.
-I didn't know that!

809
01:50:07,206 --> 01:50:10,543
Get naked.

810
01:50:11,461 --> 01:50:13,212
The triumph of the senses!

811
01:50:13,421 --> 01:50:15,131
And now?

812
01:50:15,882 --> 01:50:17,592
Kiss.
-Sure, it will be a pleasure.

813
01:50:22,555 --> 01:50:24,182
Here you are, such a little love.

814
01:50:25,016 --> 01:50:26,100
Little!

815
01:50:26,350 --> 01:50:29,520
Take my place,
if it matters so much to you.

816
01:50:29,896 --> 01:50:31,355
Is he Nikolaj?

817
01:50:31,647 --> 01:50:34,192
He is Julia's brother,
isn't him? -Yes, he is.

818
01:50:34,442 --> 01:50:37,653
Don't spoil the game.
-It's my game!

819
01:50:37,987 --> 01:50:41,324
What are you waiting for?
Go away!

820
01:50:41,616 --> 01:50:42,909
And take Pasha with you!

821
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:54,962
I knew he would come to visit
his sister sooner or later.

822
01:50:58,282 --> 01:51:01,535
Why won't we go to church
and get married?

823
01:51:02,578 --> 01:51:04,246
I beg you!

824
01:53:16,497 --> 01:53:19,833
The ball isn't here,
the ball is here...

825
01:53:31,441 --> 01:53:34,278
They hate the school,
they hate it!

826
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:36,113
It's terrible.

827
01:53:37,364 --> 01:53:41,660
They're always running away,
I see them from the windows.

828
01:53:42,202 --> 01:53:43,996
Always running away!

829
01:53:44,204 --> 01:53:48,417
We can shut the door
and the windows, to guard them...

830
01:53:48,750 --> 01:53:52,754
So running away from school
will be like escaping from jail.

831
01:53:53,255 --> 01:53:56,133
But you can escape
from jail nonetheless!

832
01:53:56,842 --> 01:54:00,762
The schools are education
institutions, serving the State.

833
01:54:01,054 --> 01:54:04,433
Formerly the State had the need
for the citizens to be slaves,

834
01:54:04,808 --> 01:54:06,977
compliant and obedient.

835
01:54:07,186 --> 01:54:09,730
Low productivity
used to turn useful,

836
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:13,025
and it was the fault
of the "emasculated" citizens.

837
01:54:13,275 --> 01:54:16,403
The schools, at
the order of the State,

838
01:54:16,612 --> 01:54:18,655
castrated the members
of our society,

839
01:54:18,989 --> 01:54:21,658
giving birth to moral castrates!

840
01:54:22,451 --> 01:54:26,580
Read Turgenev,
"Memories of an emasculator"!

841
01:54:26,830 --> 01:54:29,166
What?
- "Memories of an emasculator"

842
01:54:31,460 --> 01:54:35,214
Since we are castrates,
we can only create other castrates.

843
01:54:35,506 --> 01:54:38,801
What do you think of it?
-I don't understand.

844
01:54:39,426 --> 01:54:42,095
What castrates are you talking
about? -We castrated...

845
01:54:42,346 --> 01:54:45,766
I don't understand. -What
was first, the chicken or the egg?

846
01:54:46,225 --> 01:54:47,476
Now have you understood?

847
01:54:47,684 --> 01:54:51,355
What has this to do with castrates?
-Turgenev understood, we don't.

848
01:54:51,563 --> 01:54:55,484
I'm not following you! -What
was first, the chicken or the egg?

849
01:54:56,527 --> 01:55:00,614
What has this to do with
castrates? -Think about it.

850
01:55:01,782 --> 01:55:03,992
You think about it!

851
01:55:05,327 --> 01:55:07,913
Comrades, let me talk.

852
01:55:09,248 --> 01:55:11,083
Don't do like that.

853
01:55:11,917 --> 01:55:15,629
I participate in teachers
meeting all my life,

854
01:55:15,879 --> 01:55:19,299
We have to stop quarreling
and insulting each other!

855
01:55:19,800 --> 01:55:21,426
We have to respect
the hierarchy.

856
01:55:21,885 --> 01:55:24,221
Wait for your turn.
-Don't interrupt the speakers!

857
01:55:24,471 --> 01:55:28,475
Today the State needs
a different kind of citizen. Free.

858
01:55:29,852 --> 01:55:34,439
Whose creative potential will not
bear the burden of old dogmas.

859
01:55:34,857 --> 01:55:39,653
This brings a certain
unpredictability in the behaviour,

860
01:55:40,696 --> 01:55:42,906
A certain incongruence.

861
01:55:43,115 --> 01:55:46,451
Teachers' duty is very difficult,

862
01:55:46,785 --> 01:55:50,831
But in this way the pupil
will grow intellectually...

863
01:55:51,123 --> 01:55:53,250
I understood,

864
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:56,295
you want to send into retirement
the most experienced teachers!

865
01:55:56,753 --> 01:55:58,881
Why do you think so?

866
01:56:00,883 --> 01:56:03,927
Since I'm here, the principal
changed four times

867
01:56:04,219 --> 01:56:07,556
and if a pupil was late
everyone blamed him.

868
01:56:07,806 --> 01:56:09,766
But now?
-It's all our fault.

869
01:56:10,017 --> 01:56:12,728
Nothing to tell.
-Really nothing to tell.

870
01:56:13,187 --> 01:56:14,646
You are so rhetoric!

871
01:56:14,938 --> 01:56:18,150
We have to find a solution,
not someone to blame.

872
01:56:18,358 --> 01:56:21,487
Do something yourself! -Do not
talk to me in that tone.

873
01:57:22,297 --> 01:57:26,343
It's like bafle. If it's not there,
the bike makes hell of noise but...

874
01:57:27,094 --> 01:57:30,597
Now you no longer
need us! -Right!

875
01:57:31,306 --> 01:57:34,101
You don't need our experience,
our Ph.D., you spit on them!

876
01:57:34,434 --> 01:57:38,397
Nobody needs anything!

877
01:57:38,814 --> 01:57:40,816
Are you trying to teach
the teachers?

878
01:57:41,108 --> 01:57:44,611
Yes, I want to teach everyone,
demagogues and pedagogues!

879
01:57:47,064 --> 01:57:50,901
Excuse me, how many
"m" in "tomorrow"?

880
01:57:51,193 --> 01:57:54,822
I'm confused.

881
01:57:54,530 --> 01:57:55,614
"TO-MOR-ROW"

882
01:57:55,865 --> 01:57:58,117
And just one "m" in "communism"!

883
01:58:24,685 --> 01:58:27,521
It's unbelievable!
-Now this is too much!

884
01:58:29,314 --> 01:58:30,399
Comrades!

885
01:58:30,857 --> 01:58:33,068
The meeting shall go on.

886
01:58:34,027 --> 01:58:36,071
Just ignore him.

887
01:58:36,363 --> 01:58:40,033
Let him sleep, maybe he's sick.

888
01:58:40,283 --> 01:58:42,494
Do you know he was
hit by a student?

889
01:58:42,786 --> 01:58:45,580
He hit the student first.

890
01:58:45,914 --> 01:58:48,041
In any case, they had a fight.

891
01:58:48,291 --> 01:58:52,546
Don't wake him up.
-Maybe he's narcoleptic.

892
01:58:53,547 --> 01:58:56,258
We should lay him off!
-But he's sick.

893
01:58:56,550 --> 01:58:58,385
It's a passive way to protest!

894
01:58:58,593 --> 01:59:01,596
It's a moderate protest,
inside the bounds of legality.

895
01:59:01,847 --> 01:59:06,393
He shouldn't play
basketball with the boys.

896
01:59:06,601 --> 01:59:10,689
This way he brings into
question the teacher's authority,

897
01:59:11,023 --> 01:59:13,525
He destroys
the psychological barrier...

898
01:59:13,817 --> 01:59:15,986
That game is all
about physical contact!

899
01:59:16,236 --> 01:59:18,739
But he's so young
and full of energy!

900
01:59:18,989 --> 01:59:22,492
And nobody else
was going to do that.

901
01:59:23,076 --> 01:59:24,828
Stop it, please!

902
01:59:26,747 --> 01:59:31,126
Irina Pavlovna, the school is not
an island where you have to survive,

903
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:33,420
It's all one with society.

904
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:35,714
Sure, but we have
to obey the certain rules.

905
01:59:36,006 --> 01:59:38,925
School is like the military,
like prisons,

906
01:59:39,176 --> 01:59:41,136
We're not at the zoo.

907
01:59:41,470 --> 01:59:44,598
Accordingly to you every
teacher is bright, has a talent.

908
01:59:44,806 --> 01:59:47,559
And the boys are all geniuses.

909
01:59:47,809 --> 01:59:50,270
I'm sick of this silliness!

910
02:00:30,048 --> 02:00:31,800
RECYCLING DEPARTMENT

911
02:00:52,612 --> 02:00:53,988
Hello.

912
02:00:55,824 --> 02:00:59,035
Let us in.
-Just a moment.

913
02:00:59,536 --> 02:01:01,538
Just a little while.

914
02:01:02,497 --> 02:01:05,542
We won't stay long.
-It's not possible.

915
02:01:06,459 --> 02:01:09,796
We can see you're a good
person. -I know nothing.

916
02:01:10,213 --> 02:01:12,132
It's not possible.

917
02:01:12,590 --> 02:01:16,094
Just a moment!
-I know nothing.

918
02:01:31,484 --> 02:01:33,319
Let me help you.

919
02:01:37,490 --> 02:01:39,451
Where shall we go?

920
02:01:39,743 --> 02:01:42,662
Will you take us there?
-Follow me.

921
02:01:44,497 --> 02:01:47,417
Do you work here?
-No, I rest.

922
02:01:52,913 --> 02:01:56,375
Don't you have to unload?
-I haven't caught any dog.

923
02:01:56,625 --> 02:01:59,003
Is there a queue
at the counter? -Yes.

924
02:01:59,503 --> 02:02:02,006
What's easier to catch,
a dog or a cat?

925
02:02:02,339 --> 02:02:04,759
It's easier to catch
a venereal disease.

926
02:02:05,009 --> 02:02:07,970
Here's the kennel,
that entrance over there.

927
02:02:08,554 --> 02:02:09,430
Which one?

928
02:02:10,056 --> 02:02:11,807
That one.

929
02:02:14,977 --> 02:02:18,105
Cat and a dog, what's easier
to catch? A venereal disease!

930
02:03:15,246 --> 02:03:16,747
My God!

931
02:07:31,085 --> 02:07:32,795
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO LOOK AT IT.

932
02:07:33,087 --> 02:07:35,714
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IT.

933
02:07:36,006 --> 02:07:38,718
THIS SHOULDN'T BE REFERED

934
02:07:39,009 --> 02:07:41,804
TO DISCOURSE ABOUT GOOD AND EVIL.

935
02:07:49,528 --> 02:07:51,280
"Sadness has scattered everywhere,

936
02:07:51,530 --> 02:07:54,450
a bottle full of sadness has spilled.

937
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:57,119
Sadness soaked everything,

938
02:07:57,411 --> 02:07:59,955
clouds, clothes,

939
02:08:00,164 --> 02:08:01,957
rain, sounds,

940
02:08:02,166 --> 02:08:03,959
dust, flowers,

941
02:08:04,251 --> 02:08:06,253
bed sheets, thoughts, hairs,

942
02:08:06,462 --> 02:08:08,338
smiles, drinks,

943
02:08:08,547 --> 02:08:10,507
bread, sleep, dreams...

944
02:08:11,425 --> 02:08:13,719
Night and day alternate lazily.

945
02:08:14,428 --> 02:08:16,597
Soon these memories will disappear

946
02:08:16,847 --> 02:08:18,932
We'd better not
to evoke them again,

947
02:08:19,224 --> 02:08:21,852
they are like microbes,
they are asleep."

948
02:08:22,186 --> 02:08:26,440
From fall '46 until '47,
right in the middle of summer...

949
02:08:27,649 --> 02:08:29,526
It happened in the steppe.

950
02:08:30,861 --> 02:08:32,863
Me and my father were shepherds.

951
02:08:33,113 --> 02:08:36,658
I had taken his place that day,
I was with a comrade.

952
02:08:36,909 --> 02:08:40,329
While we were taking the animals
to the drinking trough...

953
02:08:41,330 --> 02:08:43,749
It was noon.

954
02:08:45,125 --> 02:08:47,127
All of a sudden,

955
02:08:47,669 --> 02:08:50,214
on the road
to the drinking trough,

956
02:08:50,506 --> 02:08:53,759
the same road that led to my house,

957
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:58,305
I felt something moving inside of me.

958
02:08:58,514 --> 02:09:00,808
More or less 30cm  length.

959
02:09:01,225 --> 02:09:04,353
I put my hands on
the stomach, like that.

960
02:09:05,020 --> 02:09:08,023
That thing kept moving
for almost 6 hours.

961
02:09:08,315 --> 02:09:11,318
I ran home, 15 kilometers,

962
02:09:12,611 --> 02:09:17,574
Without saying a word to my
comrade, so he was scared.

963
02:09:18,617 --> 02:09:21,078
I went home to my parents.

964
02:09:21,954 --> 02:09:25,874
I can't remember if I was crying,
but it was clear I was distressed.

965
02:09:26,417 --> 02:09:29,044
They asked me
what was the problem.

966
02:09:29,378 --> 02:09:32,715
And I told them of that time,
between '46 and '47.

967
02:09:33,632 --> 02:09:37,511
I saw myself...
With a girl.

968
02:09:42,474 --> 02:09:45,728
She wanted me to visit
her every evening.

969
02:09:46,353 --> 02:09:49,440
I didn't,

970
02:09:49,773 --> 02:09:52,818
Only when I felt like.

971
02:09:54,153 --> 02:09:56,989
So she decided
to make me food...

972
02:09:59,199 --> 02:10:01,618
Minced snake skin.

973
02:10:02,745 --> 02:10:04,955
And so she did.

974
02:10:06,248 --> 02:10:09,293
Maybe she wanted to kill me

975
02:10:09,585 --> 02:10:13,130
without having
to pay for her crime.

976
02:10:15,549 --> 02:10:19,344
I remember that evening,
I asked her for a drink.

977
02:10:20,471 --> 02:10:22,598
I was laying on the bed.

978
02:10:23,766 --> 02:10:26,352
She stopped near the window

979
02:10:26,685 --> 02:10:28,896
and she dropped in my glass

980
02:10:29,146 --> 02:10:30,939
a piece of paper.

981
02:10:31,857 --> 02:10:34,360
She was looking for something
outside of the window,

982
02:10:34,693 --> 02:10:36,278
But it was dark.

983
02:10:36,695 --> 02:10:41,241
When I felt that thing
for the first time,

984
02:10:41,575 --> 02:10:45,371
I knew she gave me
a strange potion...

985
02:10:50,167 --> 02:10:52,127
Go away, let me work!

986
02:10:52,836 --> 02:10:55,881
Take a broom and
get to work too!

987
02:10:56,340 --> 02:10:58,008
Leave me alone,
are you crazy?

988
02:10:58,300 --> 02:11:00,302
You're ripping my buttons!

989
02:11:02,096 --> 02:11:05,474
I'm going to scratch your
face, damn you!

990
02:11:06,308 --> 02:11:08,560
Leave me alone, you stupid!

991
02:11:08,977 --> 02:11:11,480
I'll tear off your hairs!

992
02:11:11,689 --> 02:11:14,108
Go away, out of my way!

993
02:11:15,150 --> 02:11:16,860
Leave me!

994
02:11:17,486 --> 02:11:20,489
Don't pull me,
your tearing my clothes!

995
02:11:21,073 --> 02:11:22,366
Stop it!

996
02:11:23,075 --> 02:11:25,119
You tore everything open!

997
02:11:26,954 --> 02:11:28,455
Look out!

998
02:11:29,915 --> 02:11:31,875
Shouldn't you be at work?

999
02:11:32,793 --> 02:11:34,878
Do you really
have nothing to do?

1000
02:11:35,462 --> 02:11:37,047
Quick, go back to work!

1001
02:11:37,423 --> 02:11:39,258
Now look at that!

1002
02:11:41,927 --> 02:11:42,803
Come on!

1003
02:11:43,595 --> 02:11:47,099
There was a young doctor,
and he was sick too.

1004
02:11:47,683 --> 02:11:50,894
He was a dentist, and he
often went philandering.

1005
02:11:51,186 --> 02:11:54,857
He did something wrong, and
they make him drink that stuff.

1006
02:11:55,149 --> 02:11:58,652
He was in pain a whole year,
and they couldn't find the reason.

1007
02:11:58,944 --> 02:12:01,405
X-rays showed nothing,

1008
02:12:01,905 --> 02:12:04,408
Because that thing has no bones.

1009
02:12:05,325 --> 02:12:09,413
The only way is to open
the person while it's still alive,

1010
02:12:09,872 --> 02:12:12,166
That's the only way to save him.

1011
02:12:12,666 --> 02:12:14,710
That dentist died.

1012
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:19,298
When they opened him up,
he had his belly full of snakes.

1013
02:12:20,924 --> 02:12:22,968
He didn't make it.

1014
02:12:23,844 --> 02:12:28,599
Amongst all animals, snakes,
frogs, lizards and spiders

1015
02:12:29,350 --> 02:12:33,062
Have certain chemicals
on their skins...

1016
02:12:33,429 --> 02:12:37,600
Common closeness of colours,
complementary hues at your leisure...

1017
02:12:38,101 --> 02:12:41,688
Violet alongside yellow,
red alongside green,

1018
02:12:41,938 --> 02:12:45,233
But what a strong choice,
the blue close to the orange!

1019
02:12:45,525 --> 02:12:48,653
You can mingle blue-green
and red bordeaux too.

1020
02:12:48,903 --> 02:12:53,366
So you have a more complex range,
dissonant and yet harmonious.

1021
02:12:54,075 --> 02:12:58,538
The greatest painters know how to take
the beauty to the borders of ugliness

1022
02:12:58,788 --> 02:13:02,750
And here the perception lay,
because reaching harmony is difficult.

1023
02:13:03,001 --> 02:13:07,046
Even women know that, it's necessary
to combine the clothes in the right way,

1024
02:13:07,380 --> 02:13:09,340
Lay down only one color.

1025
02:13:09,549 --> 02:13:13,511
One can make up a new way to bring
two colors close to each others

1026
02:13:14,429 --> 02:13:16,472
A way that exists in nature and lasts
only for a few moments, like a rainbow.

1027
02:13:21,978 --> 02:13:23,771
The most incredible things are
close to those most common.

1028
02:13:24,147 --> 02:13:25,940
Why are you so yellow in the face?

1029
02:13:26,232 --> 02:13:28,651
Take off those glasses.

1030
02:13:27,859 --> 02:13:29,611
Your eyes are red.

1031
02:13:29,569 --> 02:13:31,613
Too much joints, isn't it?

1032
02:13:32,530 --> 02:13:35,116
So young and already junkies!

1033
02:13:35,658 --> 02:13:41,164
You is skinny, your eyes are red
and your faces is yellow...

1034
02:13:41,372 --> 02:13:43,750
You're just poor junkies!

1035
02:13:45,043 --> 02:13:48,588
Vladimir Gorbachev said:
"You should drink just enough."

1036
02:13:49,464 --> 02:13:53,635
I drink a couple of glasses
after the day's work

1037
02:13:54,219 --> 02:13:59,641
and I still have energy to work.
I drink, I can't say I don't.

1038
02:14:00,516 --> 02:14:02,560
But I deserved it.

1039
02:14:02,852 --> 02:14:06,689
Look at me, what a healthy
complexion I have!

1040
02:14:07,565 --> 02:14:09,359
There is a serpent

1041
02:14:09,609 --> 02:14:12,904
living in my stomach
and in my intestine.

1042
02:14:13,446 --> 02:14:15,865
You should drink a glass of wine.

1043
02:14:16,449 --> 02:14:18,576
You'll get back your rosy on the face.

1044
02:14:18,910 --> 02:14:22,413
It makes a strange noise
a couple of times a month

1045
02:14:23,164 --> 02:14:26,167
repeating it six times more or less.

1046
02:14:26,918 --> 02:14:30,505
Possibly it doesn't like tea,
or when I get drunk.

1047
02:14:30,922 --> 02:14:32,674
I hear everything...

1048
02:14:33,007 --> 02:14:34,926
Look at you.

1049
02:14:35,176 --> 02:14:38,930
You're hiding behind
those sunglasses...

1050
02:14:39,430 --> 02:14:42,600
I'm a drunkard,
but I'm old,

1051
02:14:42,850 --> 02:14:45,353
You have all your
life in front of you!

1052
02:14:46,187 --> 02:14:48,606
You take drugs,
I'm aware of it.

1053
02:14:48,648 --> 02:14:50,817
It makes a long noise.

1054
02:14:54,737 --> 02:14:58,324
I'm 42 years old and
I'm sentenced to this martyrdom.

1055
02:14:58,866 --> 02:15:02,203
I tell doctors about my pains,

1056
02:15:02,453 --> 02:15:04,539
and they make fun of me.

1057
02:15:04,789 --> 02:15:07,333
I'm sentenced to this suffering.

1058
02:15:25,101 --> 02:15:27,395
Nikolaj Aleksejevich.

1059
02:15:27,729 --> 02:15:29,522
Wake up!

1060
02:15:47,749 --> 02:15:48,791
Nikolaj, wake up!

1061
02:15:59,761 --> 02:16:02,138
Masha, what happened?

1062
02:16:02,430 --> 02:16:04,724
How did you get here?

1063
02:16:05,308 --> 02:16:09,270
You can't even call it marriage,
if you do it at the registry office.

1064
02:16:09,562 --> 02:16:14,150
What's the use, then? -Many people
live together without even marrying.

1065
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:18,529
On the other hand religious
marriage lasts for life.

1066
02:16:21,157 --> 02:16:25,662
Amongst religious ceremonies, the only
one that belongs me is funeral mass.

1067
02:16:27,413 --> 02:16:30,583
You will get better!
-I'll explain you everything.

1068
02:16:30,833 --> 02:16:34,254
Do you know why you're always
sleepy? -I realized it only now.

1069
02:16:34,504 --> 02:16:38,049
Since you're sick,
I'm always sleepy too,

1070
02:16:38,299 --> 02:16:41,177
Without you my
life is sad and boring!

1071
02:16:41,678 --> 02:16:43,012
I swear...

1072
02:16:45,014 --> 02:16:48,560
I'll wake you up, I'll make up
something new each day.

1073
02:16:48,851 --> 02:16:50,937
Will be no more of everydayness.

1074
02:16:51,187 --> 02:16:53,106
Come with me, I beg you.

1075
02:16:54,899 --> 02:16:58,069
I don't like to speak the phone,
to listen to music,

1076
02:16:58,319 --> 02:17:01,406
to drink coffee and
to complain about life,

1077
02:17:01,656 --> 02:17:06,035
To smoke holding the cigarette
gracefully and all the rest!

1078
02:17:08,079 --> 02:17:10,331
We'll never do anything of that!

1079
02:17:11,916 --> 02:17:14,752
Come with me, I beg you.

1080
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:19,966
Are you serious? But how...

1081
02:17:21,217 --> 02:17:23,553
Now we'll go away
together, won't we?

1082
02:17:24,137 --> 02:17:26,306
I took you some clothes.

1083
02:17:27,432 --> 02:17:29,058
Here they are.

1084
02:17:47,744 --> 02:17:49,287
I told him: "Fuck you!"

1085
02:17:49,537 --> 02:17:51,497
He says: "Fuck!"

1086
02:17:51,748 --> 02:17:55,376
I reply: "Fuck off you
and your mother,

1087
02:17:55,877 --> 02:17:57,712
your father, your grandfather...

1088
02:18:06,554 --> 02:18:08,765
Spineless bastard!"

1089
02:18:10,266 --> 02:18:13,311
And he says:
"You're bastard!"

1090
02:18:13,728 --> 02:18:15,855
You're just tired, Alyosha.

1091
02:18:16,522 --> 02:18:20,693
How much I love you!
Your smell, your jacket...

1092
02:18:21,152 --> 02:18:23,488
I could die right now!

1093
02:18:25,531 --> 02:18:27,533
Your face...

1094
02:18:28,076 --> 02:18:30,411
You look like an angel!

1095
02:18:45,218 --> 02:18:48,721
I say: "Fuck off you and your grandfather,
your grandmother, your father,

1096
02:18:49,222 --> 02:18:50,807
your mother and the cat too!"

1097
02:18:51,099 --> 02:18:53,518
I don't know what crosses my mind.

1098
02:18:54,060 --> 02:18:55,645
Why?

1099
02:18:57,188 --> 02:18:59,190
It's all right.

1100
02:19:00,483 --> 02:19:02,777
I don't know why it happens.

1101
02:19:11,828 --> 02:19:13,329
Look out!

1102
02:19:14,622 --> 02:19:16,207
Another one!

1103
02:19:22,881 --> 02:19:24,424
What are you doing?

1104
02:19:29,053 --> 02:19:31,014
And then I tell him...

1105
02:20:36,454 --> 02:20:38,122
Where are we going?

1106
02:20:38,581 --> 02:20:41,417
To my house. -What
will your parents say?

1107
02:20:41,834 --> 02:20:43,503
I live with my mother.

1108
02:20:43,795 --> 02:20:48,216
If she looks annoyed, just don't
mind her, she's very nice in reality.

1109
02:21:04,482 --> 02:21:09,862
I'll do anything for you. It will be
a joy to cook and wash for you

1110
02:21:10,113 --> 02:21:12,031
while you'll be writing a novel,

1111
02:21:12,323 --> 02:21:14,659
a short story, a poem...

1112
02:21:38,933 --> 02:21:41,561
The train won't go any farther,

1113
02:21:42,395 --> 02:21:44,606
Passengers please get off the train.

1114
02:21:53,907 --> 02:21:55,575
Wake up!

1115
02:22:02,281 --> 02:22:04,199
Come on, wake up!

1116
02:22:05,701 --> 02:22:07,703
Please, wake up!

1117
02:22:16,003 --> 02:22:34,436
Is he dead?
-No, he's only sleeping.
