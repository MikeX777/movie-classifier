1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,360
 ZORRO AT THE COURT OF ENGLAND

2
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,840
 Manuel Garcia is accused of
 having aroused, by his talks

3
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,999
 and his writings, the people
 of Hamilton

4
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,159
 and of having incited them
 to revolt.

5
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,159
 By virtue of his powers,

6
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,079
 the Governor of the Island,
 Sir Basil Ruthford,

7
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,080
 sentences the accused
 to death by hanging.

8
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,479
 One day, they will have
 to pay for this.

9
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,480
 This is the third in a month.
 Sooner or later, it will be our turn.

10
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,599
 Manuel ! Manuel !

11
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,839
 It's time for us to revolt !
 Everyone !

12
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,840
 We must rebel !

13
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,480
 No-one can do anything
 against these tyrants.

14
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,759
 Damn you all ! Assassins !

15
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,159
 Damn you all !

16
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,160
 Execute him !

17
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,239
 Replace the rope.

18
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,679
 Your Excellency !
 May I point out to you

19
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,680
 that, according to tradition, if a
 condemned man escapes death,

20
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,040
 for any reason like this one,
 he is granted his freedom.

21
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,640
 You dare question my orders ?

22
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,200
 Sergeant, shoot

23
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,900
 the condemned man
 where he stands.

24
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,800
 Quickly !  Stop him !

25
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,800
 Shut the gate, quickly !

26
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Manuel !

27
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,750
 Courage, Maria.

28
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,750
 I will be back !

29
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,100
 Captain, what are you doing
 standing there ? Get moving !

30
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,500
 Rest assured,
 he will not escape me.

31
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,200
 Follow me !

32
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,200
 Idiots ! Cretins !

33
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,500
 You have let him get away.

34
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,600
 The next time,
 I will get him for sure !

35
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,000
 What are you doing standing there ?
 Get moving !

36
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,600
 Curses upon him !

37
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,500
 Down there, a ship awaits you.

38
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,400
 It will take you to England.
 Explain what is happening here.

39
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,500
 Tell the Queen she is poorly
 represented on this island.

40
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,300
 I will spread the news,
 you can rely on me.

41
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,300
 I will do all I can to talk
 with the Queen.

42
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,400
 But I would like to know your name

43
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,300
 and see your face

44
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
 So I may properly express
 my gratitude to you.

45
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,000
 Time presses, you must go.

46
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,500
 When justice and liberty

47
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,300
 once again triumph on this island,

48
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,700
 I will reveal my name to you.

49
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,100
 For the moment, I can only
 tell you that I am called

50
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,500
 Zorro !

51
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,250
 The entire population remain
 loyal to Your Majesty,

52
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,100
 and support your efforts
 in advancing the prosperity

53
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,500
 and well-being of this country.

54
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,700
 But the harassment and abuse

55
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
 instigated by Your Majesty's
 current representative

56
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,300
 serve only to exasperate
 the people.

57
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,400
 The Judges are biased firmly
 behind the Governor

58
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,200
 and only listen to the witnesses
 for the prosecution.

59
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,300
 The convicted serve their
 sentences in the Clinton mines.

60
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,700
 The few prisoners who
 survive the harsh work,

61
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,300
 are held in a cave, chained
 like beasts.

62
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,800
 It is because of this
 that a brave and worthy man,

63
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,839
 known only by the name of
 Zorro,

64
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,399
 and to whom I owe my life,

65
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,399
 has rallied the people

66
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,400
 in the hope of finally seeing
 the triumph of justice.

67
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,279
 But it is difficult

68
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,280
 to check a revolt once
 it has been triggered.

69
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,559
 And this rogue Governor 

70
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,560
 risks compromising the loyal
 respect that your subjects

71
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,520
 feel towards England.

72
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,720
 I urge you to intervene
 without delay.

73
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,599
 We will do so, if your report
 to us is confirmed.

74
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,799
 Your Majesty,

75
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,239
 may I suffer the severest of
 your punishments

76
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,239
 should you find that I have lied.

77
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,240
 We cannot condemn one
 of our Governors

78
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,480
 simply on the basis of rumour
 and one isolated denunciation.

79
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,640
 But if the situation proves
 to be as you say,

80
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,639
 Governor Basil Ruthford

81
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,999
 will be recalled and dealt
 with severely,

82
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 and he will be replaced by one
 who better represents

83
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,119
 the law and order we demand.

84
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,079
 As for your ghostly hero ...

85
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,959
 What did you call him ?

86
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,079
 Zorro.

87
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,080
 While we may well admire
 his audacity and courage,

88
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,279
 we are forced to consider
 his exploits,

89
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,280
 however well-intentioned,
 as completely illegal.

90
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,240
 No-one has the right to take
 the law into his own hands.

91
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,199
 Zorro considers himself
 an outsider

92
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,519
 and not answerable to
 England's statutes.

93
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,520
 We shall see about that.

94
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,239
 Your Majesty,

95
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,519
 if you will excuse us.

96
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,919
 The Privy Council requests
 your permission

97
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,679
 to enter.

98
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,639
 You may go, Senor Garcia.
 Have no fear.

99
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,239
 Justice will be done.

100
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,879
 It was with that certainty
 in my mind

101
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,880
 that I came to address
 Your Majesty.

102
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,880
 General Kingston, allow the
 Privy Council to enter.

103
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,320
 Gentlemen...

104
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,200
 Be seated.

105
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,799
 The Privy Council has been
 convened to discuss

106
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,199
 a trade agreement

107
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,879
 with Denmark, and ...

108
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,359
 My Lord Privy Seal, you will

109
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,199
 excuse me for interrupting

110
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,200
 but, before we talk about the
 trade agreement with Denmark,

111
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,560
 I would like to submit to the
 judgment of the Privy Council

112
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,680
 a report that has troubled
 me profoundly.

113
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,640
 One of our subjects, a native
 of one of our colonies,

114
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,039
 the Island of Hamilton,
 in the Bermudas,

115
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,639
 has told me of
 a desperate situation

116
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,039
 developing in this colony

117
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,839
 as the result of the harassment
 and abuse

118
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,599
 that the Governor is undertaking

119
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,600
 both in our name,
 and in the name of England.

120
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,119
 I might humbly observe that
 cases where

121
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,120
 subjects are dissatisfied
 with their government are legion.

122
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,640
 And that, very often,
 their motives are

123
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,879
  strictly personal.

124
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,039
 This man miraculously escaped

125
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,639
 his own execution that was
 decreed by the Governor.

126
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,279
 Rather than flee,

127
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,119
 he decided to come to England,

128
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,879
 to ask for justice for himself

129
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,199
 and for his country,

130
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,200
 declaring he was ready to be
 punished if he has lied.

131
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,959
 Might I ask

132
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,919
 who is this Governor ?

133
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,920
 Sir Basil Ruthford.

134
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,679
 Before settling this matter,

135
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,680
 we want to know the truth
 about conditions on this island.

136
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,559
 The Privy Council must send

137
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,560
 one of its senior members,
 who will prepare for me

138
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,680
 a detailed status report.

139
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,560
 And so, who among you,
 is willing

140
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,399
 to face the difficulties
 and possible dangers

141
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,400
 of a voyage such as this ?

142
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,919
 I am, Your Majesty.

143
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,959
 You, Lord Moore ?

144
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,839
 I came to this role
 by right of succession

145
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,840
 and I have not yet been able
 to prove to Your Majesty

146
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,839
 my dedication and loyalty.

147
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,839
 I am pleased
 to take this opportunity.

148
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,840
 I thought the role of guardian
 to your nephew and niece

149
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,719
 was the closest to your heart ?

150
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,720
 Young William Scott is now
 attending Royal Military College.

151
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,200
 I can therefore hardly
 do more for his education.

152
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,759
 As for Patricia Scott,

153
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,639
 she is a girl who is full of life

154
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,199
 and she would be delighted
 to accompany me

155
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,639
 upon this trip.

156
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,439
 That being the case ...

157
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,279
 - Admiral Britt.
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

158
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,280
 Place one of your vessels
 at the disposal of Lord Moore.

159
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,600
 As quickly as possible.

160
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,360
 Now let us turn to the trade
 agreement with Denmark ....

161
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,639
 Milady, according to your Uncle,

162
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,640
 one boat is not enough
 to carry all your baggage.

163
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,479
 It will require the entire
 Fleet of Her Majesty.

164
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,480
 - So, I must restrain myself ?
 - Just so, MiIady.

165
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,239
 I have always wanted
 to go on a long trip,

166
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,159
 to see new places.

167
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,160
 Well, I can understand you
 wanting to see Paris or Rome,

168
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,999
 but Hamilton ....

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,119
 Rome and Paris are so close.

170
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,120
 I will have lots of opportunities
 in my life to visit them.

171
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,439
 Why such a sad face ?

172
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,519
 This will be our first time apart.

173
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,399
 Do you think I will love you
 less, little brother ?

174
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,400
 No, but what will I do on a Sunday,
 if you aren't there to greet me ?

175
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,639
 You must write to me,
 and I will do the same.

176
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,640
 On my return, we will each read
 all that has been written.

177
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,799
 The only good thing in all this

178
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,639
 is that Uncle is also leaving.

179
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,479
 I won't have to see him anymore

180
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,480
 and I won't have to answer
 his insufferable questions.

181
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,079
 ''Well then, my boy, how are things ?

182
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,080
 ''Are you behaving as appropriate
 for the heir to a great name ?

183
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,760
 ''Do you recall - the boy is the
 father of the man?''

184
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,919
 - Can't you bear it ?
 - No.

185
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,279
 I am afraid that
 reports of your sea voyage

186
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,719
 have not been taken well.

187
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,759
 What is your judgment ?

188
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,959
 The situation is critical.

189
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,960
 Your creditors are likely
 to create a scandal.

190
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,159
 You must do something
 to prevent it.

191
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,439
 I cannot perform miracles.

192
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,159
 You forget, it seems, that
 our last business together

193
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,279
 netted you a handsome profit.

194
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,839
 I have not forgotten, and
 I am grateful to you. But ...

195
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,840
 But the situation today is
 more serious than ever.

196
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,120
 My niece Patricia is young
 and quite charming.

197
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,599
 There are already suitors
 at my door.

198
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,600
 What if I am faced with
 a proposal of marriage

199
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,799
 that I cannot refuse ?

200
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,639
 What can I possibly say to this
 future husband ?

201
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,319
 That Patricia Scott, instead of
 being a rich heiress,

202
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,600
 doesn't have a farthing
 to her name,

203
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,500
 because I have squandered
 her fortune ?

204
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 The laws in England are
 very severe in such cases.

205
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,300
 For me, it would be the end.

206
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,700
 By taking her away with me,
 I am removing that danger.

207
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,700
 Also, this trip to Hamilton
 provides me a useful ally.

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,400
 Sir Basil Ruthford, the Governor,
 is a good friend of mine.

209
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,900
 I understand.

210
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 But how can we deal with
 the current crisis ?

211
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,250
 Sell the properties in Sheffield.

212
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,700
 Sheffield ? The last remaining
 properties of the children !

213
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,300
 I will make sure they are
 no longer required.

214
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,300
 Milady...

215
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,000
 Cadet William Scott,
 your free period is over.

216
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,000
 We must go.

217
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,300
 Goodbye, Patricia.

218
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,000
 Return soon.

219
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,500
 Zorro... Zorro... Zorro !

220
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,300
 I hear that name,
 from everyone I meet.

221
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,600
 And now, from you as well.

222
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,600
 Yes, from me. Of course.

223
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,000
 Zorro isn't just a name,

224
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,100
 he is a myth.

225
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,650
 A myth ?

226
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,400
 A bandit, a common outlaw.

227
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,900
 When he falls into my hands,
 he won't look so alluring,

228
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,300
 swinging from the gallows !

229
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,800
 What if you should fail,

230
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,100
 and word of his exploits
 reaches England ?

231
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,500
 England is far away.

232
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,300
 And the English have better
 things to do

233
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,900
 than concern themselves
 about this island

234
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,500
 In your place, I wouldn't be
 so cocksure.

235
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,200
 When I first knew you,
 you were poor. 

236
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,200
 but I loved you as much
 as I do now.

237
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,200
 Let's leave for a remote
 part of the world

238
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,400
 where we can live modestly
 together.

239
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,200
 Rosanna, you are a woman.

240
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,900
 You cannot understand.

241
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Do you think I could go
 back to the sort of life

242
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,200
 we first led here, having
 grown used to this ?

243
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,959
 I love the money, yes,

244
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,960
 but I love the power above all.

245
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,319
 You are ignoring
 the elation that I feel

246
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,079
 as I order around these
 beggars who hate me

247
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,080
 but fall at my feet
 because they fear me.

248
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,319
 - Who is it ?
 - Captain Wells.

249
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,879
 With urgent and important news.

250
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,159
 One moment, Captain.
 Go, I beg you.

251
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,159
 Do you believe no-one knows
 of our relationship ?

252
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,160
 It's better if we maintain
 appearances.

253
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,240
 They can be maintained later.

254
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,360
 Come in, Captain Wells.

255
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,359
 Well, Captain ?

256
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,360
 Excellency, a dispatch has
 arrived from Port Combley.

257
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,439
 An English vessel has arrived
 unexpectedly.

258
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,440
 Lord Moore has disembarked,
 accompanied by a young woman,

259
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,159
 his niece, I understand.

260
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,959
 They have hired a carriage
 and are coming here.

261
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,960
 Percy Moore ?

262
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,919
 What are you waiting for ?
 Take a detachment

263
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,920
 and go and meet them.
 Convey to them my welcome.

264
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,800
 I never thought there
 could be so much sun.

265
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,120
 Now we can forget
 the fogs of London, Patricia.

266
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,720
 Who are those men ?
 Why are they treated that way ?

267
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,839
 They are traitors.

268
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,840
 They disobeyed the orders
 of the Governor.

269
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,120
 What is it now ?

270
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,679
 Quickly !

271
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,680
 Throw out your gun
 and get down.

272
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,039
 Welcome to Hamilton, Lord Moore.

273
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,839
 You have just passed

274
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,439
 a column of prisoners.

275
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,559
 Those sorry people

276
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,359
 were once happy citizens.
 But...

277
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,360
 they could no longer afford
 to pay the arbitrary taxes

278
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,799
 imposed by the Governor.

279
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,800
 Sir Basil Ruthford, invoking a
 law that he himself imposed,

280
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,400
 confiscated their property
 and reduced them to slavery.

281
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,120
 They now toil for
 a mouthful of bread

282
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,719
 and a filthy mattress of straw.

283
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,720
 The people know that the
 Queen has heard of this abuse

284
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,319
 and has sent you, Lord Moore,

285
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,320
 to inspect the colony.

286
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,799
 We are hopeful that

287
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,800
 you will bring a halt to what is
 happening here. Otherwise...

288
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,479
 Otherwise ?

289
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,159
 Otherwise, by the word of Zorro,

290
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,719
 I will enforce justice.

291
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,959
 And you will return to England,

292
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,159
 bearing my trademark :

293
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,199
 the Z that is my initial.

294
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,200
 Will you also submit me
 to the same treatment ?

295
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,719
 No.

296
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,559
 On a face as beautiful as yours,

297
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,719
 I could not use the sword.

298
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,720
 I will draw the Z,
 but with a flower.

299
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,400
 Goodbye !

300
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,760
 Quickly ! That way !

301
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,200
 Down there !
 Quickly, let's pursue him !

302
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,679
 Amazing, unbelievable !

303
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,399
 Such banditry in one of
 Her Majesty's colonies !

304
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,359
 To think that my friend Ruthford

305
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,799
 is unable to prevent
 such things happening.

306
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,679
 It is hardly surprising, Milord,

307
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,719
 given the sight we had
 of those poor prisoners.

308
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,720
 What are you saying,
 you are impertinent !

309
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,800
 I advise you to hold your tongue.

310
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,199
 Good day, Milady.  Milord.

311
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,199
 Has something happened ?

312
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,839
 I am Pedro Suarez,

313
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,840
 and the surrounding land is mine.

314
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,719
 Did you see the soldiers
 - pursuing a masked man ?

315
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,720
 No. May I ask to whom I have
 the honour of speaking ?

316
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,839
 Lord Percy Moore,

317
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,839
 envoy of
 Her Majesty, Queen Victoria.

318
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,840
 This is my niece, Patricia Scott.

319
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,200
 We were heading to the
 Governor's home, when Zorro,

320
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,359
 threatened us.

321
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,279
 Zorro ?

322
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,280
 I thought this Zorro was a
 figment of popular legend.

323
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,919
 I can assure you, Senor Suarez,

324
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,679
 we saw him with our own eyes.

325
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,680
 In that case, I accept your assurance.

326
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,679
 Nothing, he disappeared.

327
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,680
 Captain Wells, at the service
 of the Governor.

328
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,800
 In short, Captain, you have
 allowed him to escape.

329
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,280
 Excuse me, Captain, but why have
 you arrested my servant Pedrito ?

330
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,119
 Ah, he is your servant ?

331
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,120
 You surely don't think that
 Zorro and Pedrito are one ?

332
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,399
 Free him !

333
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,759
 Lord Moore, when you wish.

334
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,079
 I have been ordered to escort
 you to the Palace.

335
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,239
 The precaution is now useless.

336
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,240
 But you can follow us if you like.

337
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,280
 Good day to you !

338
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,759
 If you will allow,
 I will come with you.

339
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,999
 If you wish.

340
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 I will direct you.  I wish
 to prove to Lady Patricia

341
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,200
 that this land is not all
 chained prisoners

342
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,239
 and masked bandits.

343
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,240
 Pedrito, my horse !

344
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,160
 Follow me !

345
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,039
 And here we are, Lady Patricia.

346
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,839
 Rosanna will show you
 to your rooms

347
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,840
 which, I hope, will please you.

348
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,400
 Through the windows you
 can see the entire park.

349
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,399
 - As for yourself ...
 - Of little importance.

350
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,400
 If the ladies permit,
 we should talk, my dear Basil.

351
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,679
 It will be a great pleasure.

352
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,680
 A reunion with an old friend.
 I can't wait to get together,

353
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,279
 and reminisce about old times.

354
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,679
 If you will follow me, Lady Scott.

355
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,680
 Until later, Excellency.

356
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,119
 Although I am no longer
 a young man,

357
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,399
 I am still single.

358
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,199
 Rosanna Gonzalez manages
 the home,

359
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,199
 a task little suited to a man.

360
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,959
 A charming woman.

361
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,519
 Yes, this is quite true.

362
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,679
 Would you care for a whisky
 in my office ?

363
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,680
 Gladly.

364
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,839
 This is wonderful, Milady !

365
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,159
 The countryside is marvellous.

366
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,679
 - Are you not happy ?
 - I'm not sure.

367
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,999
 When we left the ship,
 I was happy

368
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 but since then - those men
 in chains and that masked man

369
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,999
 have left me a little troubled.

370
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,999
 Pedro Suarez also - he
 troubled you.

371
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,879
 He seemed to me to be
 devouring you with his eyes !

372
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,879
 I can't say the same
 of his servant Pedrito.

373
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,880
 Ah, he is a nice boy.

374
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,320
 Try this whisky. It is 15 years old.

375
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,959
 Tip-top.

376
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,479
 It's best that I let you know
 straightaway

377
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,159
 the reasons for my presence here.

378
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,160
 The Queen has heard some
 unflattering things

379
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,959
 about the way you govern here.

380
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,559
 I know.
 It's said I have an iron fist,

381
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,560
 that I am a tyrant,
 that I oppress the population.

382
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,920
 Please understand me.
 The Queen is still very young,

383
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,439
 and rather overenthusiastic

384
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,440
 in handling her grave duties.
 But, given time,

385
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,839
 she will come to appreciate

386
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,840
 that Empire can be maintained
 only with force.

387
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,519
 Then, you do not disapprove
 of my approach ?

388
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,439
 No, not at all.

389
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,440
 As long as it is not used to
 enhance your personal fortune.

390
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,199
 I don't understand you.

391
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,200
 This whisky is truly exceptional.

392
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,720
 We were very close in our
 younger days, Basil,

393
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,200
 and we know each other's
 strengths and weaknesses.

394
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,959
 When the Queen called
 for this inspection,

395
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,960
 I immediately put myself forward.

396
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,839
 ''Can my friend Basil really

397
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,840
 have committed such a
 sin ?", I asked myself.

398
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,719
 I thought it would be better

399
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,720
 if I were to come here,
 rather than any other.

400
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,999
 For example,

401
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,439
 General Kingston.

402
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,039
 Kingston, you say ?

403
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,040
 The adviser most listened to
 by Her Majesty.

404
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,120
 The men in chains, and the
 presence of Zorro, would have

405
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,280
 given him a clear enough idea
 of the true situation here.

406
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Perhaps you would already be
 on your way back to England,

407
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,159
 under the cloud of a serious charge.

408
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,160
 Then it only remains for me to
 thank you, Sir Percy

409
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,480
 and fervently to wish that
 our old friendship

410
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,640
 be renewed by fresh
 commonalities of interest.

411
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,480
 That is my wish also.

412
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,080
 Excuse me, Milady.

413
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,960
 For Milady Patricia Scott.

414
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,840
 A gift from my master,
 Don Pedro Suarez.

415
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,319
 With this.

416
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,320
 These are for you, from me.

417
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,800
 Without a note, because I do
 not know how to write.

418
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,280
 Read it to me.

419
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,599
 ''Now the flowers of Hamilton

420
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,879
 ''know that there is another
 more lovely than they

421
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,159
 ''and they bow to your beauty.

422
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,319
 ''Pedro Suarez.''

423
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,079
 Ah, such a beautiful sentiment !

424
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,519
 Louisa,

425
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,520
 one should never trust the
 amorous words of men.

426
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,959
 It is not true.  It is a lie.

427
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,839
 I wanted to defend the
 honour of my daughter.

428
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,279
 But I didn't shoot.

429
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,280
 I didn't shoot !
 What you are saying is false.

430
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,439
 Mind what you say, Cortez,

431
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,440
 and respect this Tribunal, which
 has the honour of welcoming

432
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,360
 the Special Envoy from
 Her Majesty, The Queen.

433
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,319
 Conduct yourself calmly,

434
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,479
 and we will give you justice.

435
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,879
 It is true.

436
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,399
 I kept some writings in my home

437
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,239
 of Manuel Garcia, knowing
 that it was prohibited.

438
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,879
 When the soldiers came to search,

439
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,880
 I immediately agreed to co-operate.

440
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,519
 But one soldier,
 in spite of my pleading, 

441
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,279
 abused my daughter
 with words and gestures

442
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,599
 that would incense every father.

443
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,600
 I intervened.
 But he resisted me.

444
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,840
 His colleague, wishing to
 defend him, fired at me.

445
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,559
 But the bullet hit my opponent.

446
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,679
 I am speaking the absolute truth.

447
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,279
 Ask my daughter if what I say

448
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,519
  is not what happened

449
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,520
 The Tribunal does not accept
 the testimony of relatives.

450
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,119
 Then, believe me !

451
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,120
 I swear before God that
 I have spoken the truth !

452
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,760
 - Believe me.
 - Have Captain Wells enter.

453
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,560
 Captain Wells !

454
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,159
 Do you swear to tell the truth,

455
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,599
 the whole truth, and
 nothing but the truth.

456
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,919
 Say, "I swear".

457
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,279
 I swear.

458
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,280
 Captain Wells, without reading
 what is written here,

459
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,480
 do you confirm your testimony
 made in this statement ?

460
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,359
 Excuse me, Excellency.

461
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,360
 Without wishing to interfere,
 it is my duty

462
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,840
 to know exactly what
 Captain Wells has said.

463
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,999
 Speak, Wells.

464
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,319
 The accused is wrong 

465
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,439
 to claim I had any involvement.

466
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,799
 In fact, he could not even
 have seen me there.

467
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,800
 I was coming through the door,
 just preparing to intervene,

468
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,679
 but I was too slow.

469
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,119
 Before I could act,

470
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,759
 the accused had grabbed
 a gun from one of my men

471
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,599
 and killed his opponent.

472
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,159
 No, that isn't true !

473
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,160
 It isn't true !
 It's a lie ! A lie ! A lie !

474
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,679
 Silence !

475
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,599
 Silence !
 Or I will clear the Court.

476
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,479
 It is a falsehood, sir.

477
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,519
 The Captain was in the tavern.

478
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,559
 He played cards at my table.

479
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,279
 - You are sure ?
 - Certain.

480
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,639
 Why did you say nothing ?

481
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,199
 I have a wife and children.
 They wouldn't let me.

482
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,559
 What about you ?

483
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,560
 Me ? My only concern is
 for a peaceful life.

484
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,719
 What if you appealed to Zorro ?

485
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,720
 He is more capable than I
 in handling this sort of thing.

486
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,839
 Silence !

487
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,959
 Silence !

488
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,959
 You can step down, Captain.

489
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,960
 Excellency.

490
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,200
 The Prosecution has the floor.

491
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,800
 This crime is punishable
 by death,

492
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,640
 but, given the particular
 provocation in this case,

493
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,360
 I call for the sentence to be
 commuted to forced labour

494
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,679
 for perpetuity.

495
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,599
 The Defence has the floor.

496
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,600
 The Defence has the floor !

497
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,840
 I call for clemency of the Court.

498
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,799
 Silence !

499
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,800
 In the name of Her Britannic
 Majesty, Queen Victoria,

500
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,399
 given the findings of this trial

501
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,400
 which prove the culpability
 of the accused

502
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,800
 I sentence Francisco Cortez
 to forced labour for perpetuity.

503
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,040
 He will serve his sentence
 in the mines of Clinton,

504
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,239
 where he will be transferred
 without any delay.

505
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,559
 Silence !

506
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,999
 The mines of Clinton ?

507
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,319
 I'd rather be killed than that !

508
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,199
 Assassins !

509
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,200
 Assassins !

510
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,879
 Guards, clear the Court !

511
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,479
 Assassins !

512
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,480
 Assassins !

513
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,759
 I am sorry, Lord Moore,

514
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,559
 But you must see the necessity

515
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,839
 to deal severely
 with these people.

516
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,279
 I understand.

517
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,759
 To make amends,

518
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,760
 I intend to organise
 tomorrow at the Palace

519
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,839
 a ball in your honour, and
 that of your niece.

520
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,840
 Thank you.

521
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,759
 Do you accept the challenge ?

522
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,759
 Certainly.

523
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,760
 Good fortune, Captain !

524
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,480
 You have brought me luck !

525
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,600
 Nobody move !

526
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,240
 It was your false testimony
 that condemned an innocent man

527
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,679
 to forced labour.

528
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,279
 I could kill you.

529
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,159
 But I am giving you the chance
 to defend yourself.

530
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,160
 Just the two of us !

531
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,039
 I let you keep your life,

532
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,040
 but this indelible sign will be
 the mark of your infamy.

533
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Each time that I see you again,
 I will add others to it !

534
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,199
 Stay where you are !

535
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,200
 Grab him ! There he goes !

536
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,360
 It's Zorro ! We've taken him !

537
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,320
 Let me go ! Release me,
 you cretins ! Cretins !

538
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,679
 Louisa !

539
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,599
 - Well, will you come ?
 - I don't know.

540
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,599
 Milady may have need of me.

541
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,679
 No, I don't think so.

542
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,719
 I will wait for you in a half-hour.

543
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,720
 Very well.

544
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,440
 I imagine that, in London,
 the waltz is very popular.

545
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,600
 Here,
 we are just being introduced to it.

546
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,160
 My word, Lady Patricia, it is
 the truth, you dance divinely.

547
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,400
 May I also have the honour
 of dancing with you ?

548
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,640
 Please.

549
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,999
 Everyone has noted the attention

550
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,039
 you have shown to that young lady.

551
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,039
 A diplomatic obligation, my dear.

552
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,639
 I must keep on good terms
 with her guardian.

553
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,919
 Ah yes, really ?

554
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,359
 You don't seem to find it
 too distasteful.

555
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,679
 Rosanna, believe me,

556
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,239
 do not concern yourself with
 matters that do not affect you.

557
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,240
 Be careful in what you're
 doing, Basil.

558
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,880
 You cannot set me aside so easily.

559
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,039
 May I take her from you ?

560
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,040
 With pleasure, Milord.

561
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,079
 Lady Patricia, may we take a
 few moments in the garden ?

562
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,080
 Yes, willingly.

563
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,359
 I dance rather badly,

564
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,360
 and I think a bit of fresh air
 will do us both good.

565
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,479
 It is stifling inside.

566
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,279
 What a beautiful starry sky !

567
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,280
 There are two things that
 never change here :

568
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,399
 the stars and the sun.

569
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,279
 You seem sad about that.

570
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,800
 Yes. Because here they cannot
 be enjoyed for their true value.

571
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,799
 And yet, when we first met,

572
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,800
 you seemed well content
 with your lot.

573
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,080
 Oh, I am;  but I would like my
 fellow man to feel the same.

574
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,799
 Yesterday morning, that poor
 Cortez was sentenced

575
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,319
 and was condemned
 to a terrible punishment.

576
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,479
 Last night, Zorro was boasting

577
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,639
 about what he would do to
 Captain Wells.

578
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,640
 Boasting ? A man who dares
 confront his enemies alone ?

579
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,719
 What ardour !

580
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,599
 So, you also share

581
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,600
 the admiration that everyone
 feels for Zorro ?

582
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,040
 I don't know much about
 the situation in this colony.

583
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,800
 It's a matter that concerns
 my Uncle, Lord Moore.

584
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,800
 But my intuition is that
 Zorro is fighting a just cause.

585
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,679
 I see.

586
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,680
 Now I will refrain from
 speaking about him.

587
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,639
 Lady Patricia,

588
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,159
 since you arrived,

589
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,119
 I have thought of nothing but you.

590
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,999
 I am stricken with a feeling

591
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,999
 that I can only describe
 as love, and ...

592
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 I beg you, Don Suarez,
 do not go on.

593
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,719
 You Latins,
 you burn with passion,

594
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,799
 but, very often, your fire

595
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,800
 goes out as easily as it was lit.

596
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,039
 I will prove to you that
 you are wrong.

597
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,319
 At least, leave me with a hope.

598
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,959
 Shouldn't I be getting back ?

599
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,519
 - Lady Patricia ?
 - Not with me.

600
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,520
 I believe someone is looking
 for you.

601
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,679
 Dear Patricia,

602
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,279
 you promised me the next dance.

603
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,280
 Sr. Suarez was showing me the
 wonders of this fabulous country.

604
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,879
 Sr. Suarez is an excellent guide

605
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,479
 and an example to us all.

606
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,159
 If only all were like him, here !

607
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,399
 You permit me ?

608
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,479
 Are you coming ?

609
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,480
 No, thank you. As I told you,
 it is too hot inside.

610
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,839
 Your visit has delighted us.

611
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,399
 You fill this sad palace

612
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,400
  with the breath of youth.

613
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,959
 If my coming has provoked
 so much emotion,

614
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,960
 perhaps it would have been
 better if I'd stayed in England.

615
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,119
 Why ?

616
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,119
 Has someone been speaking
 to you in the same manner ?

617
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,359
 Nobody move !

618
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,360
 Lord Moore has been witness
 to a terrible injustice.

619
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,599
 An innocent man
 has been condemned.

620
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,639
 You can still prove

621
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,039
 that your coming here
 was not useless ....

622
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,959
 by arranging for the immediate
 release of Francisco Cortez.

623
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,079
 Otherwise, it will be myself

624
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,080
 who, tomorrow night,
 will free the prisoner !

625
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,640
 Don't shoot !

626
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,279
 Guards, catch him !

627
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,280
 Quickly, after him !

628
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,240
 Ow ! Ouch !

629
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,119
 What are you doing there ?
 Did you see Zorro ?

630
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,319
 - Yes.
 - Where is he ?

631
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,559
 He stunned me, he went that way.

632
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,560
 Guards ! Block the exits !

633
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 Man all the gates !

634
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,639
 Louisa !

635
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,959
 What are you doing here ?
 I heard shooting.

636
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,960
 It's nothing. Just Zorro, as usual.
 What does that mean to us ?

637
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,199
 My mistress needs me..

638
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,679
 Some other time.

639
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,680
 - Stay here a while with me.
 - No.

640
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,160
 Louisa...

641
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,880
 - How are you, Milady ?
 - Better, thank you.

642
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,919
 It's over now, thank Heaven.

643
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,199
 Is it true, what that man said ?

644
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,200
 An innocent man was condemned
 and you let it happen ?

645
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,719
 Let's dance.
 May the party continue.

646
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,119
 I don't have any luck.

647
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,759
 Once more, I missed seeing
 the famous Zorro.

648
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,439
 I was taking the air,
 and got back too late.

649
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,399
 Perhaps you could have
 captured him ?

650
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,159
 That is not my responsibility.

651
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,959
 That's up to Captain Wells
 and his soldiers.

652
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,399
 So, Wells ?

653
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,400
 Nothing. He disappeared.
 As fleet of foot as always.

654
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,439
 Wells, he has scarred you again.

655
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,799
 If this keeps up,
 your face will resemble

656
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,679
 a map in an atlas.

657
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,319
 Patricia, will you dance ?

658
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,320
 Excuse us.

659
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,800
 Madame Rosanna ?

660
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,880
 I came to wish you a good night

661
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,839
 and to check that all the
 excitements of the evening

662
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,079
 didn't disturb you too much.

663
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,359
 I thank you for your
 thoughtfulness.

664
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,360
 This is the second time
 that I've seen Zorro

665
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,559
 and I must confess that
 I find him rather fascinating.

666
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,719
 You, Lady Patricia,

667
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,359
 fascinated by a bandit ?

668
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,919
 A bandit, perhaps.

669
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,599
 But, you must admit,
 he has courage.

670
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,999
 To defy the Governor in his
 own Palace,

671
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,919
 on his own, in spite of the guards !

672
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,799
 I understand.

673
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,800
 At your age, I also was
 easily enchanted

674
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,719
 by tales of adventure.

675
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,159
 And I wrapped myself
 inside my dreams.

676
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,399
 But then, over time,

677
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,679
 all my dreams have been dashed,

678
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,559
 and I have finished up,
 trapped on this island,

679
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,999
 far from the rest of the world.

680
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,159
 Aren't you happy here ?

681
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,399
 Happy ? Yes ...

682
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,320
 As much as a woman can be
 who keeps her eyes open

683
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,480
 and can see the face of reality.

684
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,360
 You have had a lot of success
 this evening, Patricia.

685
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,960
 I saw that Don Pedro was
 paying court to you.

686
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,080
 and also ... the Governor.

687
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,280
 They were all very pleasant
 towards me.

688
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,479
 But, take care, Lady Patricia.

689
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,239
 Beware of those who flatter you.

690
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,240
 Here, any novelty generates
 a lot of enthusiasm,

691
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,199
 but it doesn't last long.

692
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,200
 So, don't have too many illusions !

693
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,199
 Yes, but what do you mean ?

694
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,799
 I mean that it is rather dangerous

695
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,719
 to play games with the Governor.

696
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,439
 The Governor ?

697
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,199
 Don't play the innocent.

698
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,200
 Be aware that I am ready to
 defend, with all my power,

699
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,040
 the position I have gained for
 myself with pain and humiliation.

700
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,879
 But ...

701
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,159
 But I've done nothing.

702
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,879
 Of course not, Patricia.

703
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:08,959
 Excuse me.

704
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,239
 I do not want to make you cry.

705
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,239
 I want only ....
 to put you on your guard.

706
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,240
 You know, maybe I had a
 little too much to drink tonight.

707
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,679
 And I needed to unburden myself.

708
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,680
 It is good for women to confide
 with each other. Isn't it ?

709
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,519
 Though you are younger than I,

710
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,520
 I sense that we understand
 each other.

711
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,560
 Good night, Lady Patricia.

712
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,840
 And enjoy your dreams
 of adventure.

713
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,599
 No, don't be afraid.

714
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,159
 I want to talk with you.

715
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,519
 I refuse to listen to a bandit.

716
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,439
 I am not a bandit.

717
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,319
 You know I fight for a just cause.

718
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,279
 To free this colony from a tyrant

719
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,280
 and to release the innocents
 from our prisons.

720
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,440
 Do not believe what the friends
 of the Governor say of me.

721
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,400
 I would be very sad
 if you thought badly of me.

722
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,559
 Why does it matter
 what I think of you ?

723
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,560
 To know you believe in me
 would urge me to victory.

724
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,759
 - Lady Patricia !
 - You must go !

725
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,279
 Stay in your room tonight.

726
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,559
 I am coming to the Palace
 to rescue Cortez.

727
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,560
 No. They will capture you.
 There are guards everywhere.

728
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,720
 Goodbye.

729
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,879
 Patricia !

730
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,119
 Why have you not
 kept up with us ?

731
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,039
 We have been looking
 everywhere for you.

732
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,159
 My horse carried me
 in the wrong direction.

733
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,679
 We were enjoying the freedom
 of the gallop.

734
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,439
 That was unwise, my dear.

735
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,440
 Zorro is somewhere in this
 vicinity, according to reports.

736
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,399
 Imagine that,
 if you had met with him ?

737
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,400
 That man is capable of anything.

738
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,479
 Excellency,

739
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,439
 he is heading for the clearing.

740
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,199
 He is cornered, trapped !

741
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:37,200
 Then go, quickly !

742
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,279
 Go, return home !

743
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,280
 Go home !

744
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,520
 What are you doing ?
 Working !

745
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,799
 - Did you see Zorro ?
 - No, only his horse.

746
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,559
 Idiots !

747
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,959
 You have let him get away.

748
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,960
 You, search for him,
 and be quick !

749
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,120
 You, Sergeant. You will never
 get a promotion !

750
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,679
 All of you, down there !

751
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,680
 Search around the perimeter
 - from top to bottom !

752
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,439
 And you, get back to work !

753
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,159
 Search as far as you can !

754
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,160
 And keep your eyes about you !

755
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
 He must not escape us !

756
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,520
 Hurry up !

757
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,680
 Follow me !

758
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,360
 You, what are you doing there ?
 Get your cart out of here !

759
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,679
 There's nothing like an old port

760
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,680
 to finish a meal properly.

761
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,119
 Excellency,

762
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,439
 Captain Wells wishes to see you.

763
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,039
 Let him enter.

764
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,519
 Excellent, this port,
 truly excellent.

765
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,520
 I am happy that you like it.
 I had it brought from Lisbon.

766
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,199
 What is it, Captain ?

767
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,559
 Excellency,

768
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,199
 the main entrance is guarded.

769
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,200
 No-one can enter without
 a pass signed by me.

770
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,960
 3 patrols surround the grounds,
 as many are watching the park.

771
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,920
 Those who do not know
 the password will be arrested.

772
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,119
 It is absolutely impossible
 for Zorro,

773
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,679
 unless he has
 the gift of invisibility,

774
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,559
 to get into the Palace.

775
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,279
 And, even if he did get in,

776
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,399
 he would not get out alive.

777
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,599
 I cannot agree to that, Captain.

778
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,600
 Zorro, I want him alive.

779
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,960
 That would be the best execution
 we have ever seen in Hamilton.

780
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,159
 My compliments, Captain.

781
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,599
 This time, I am certain,

782
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,600
 you will repay Zorro for the
 humiliations he inflicted on you.

783
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,040
 I predict that his capture
 and execution

784
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
 will bring an end to this myth

785
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,720
 that has excited the more
 romantic amongst us.

786
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,239
 Excuse me, I feel tired.

787
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,679
 Please allow me to withdraw.

788
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,680
 I will accompany you, Milady.

789
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,559
 Return to your post.

790
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,560
 I will wait all night
 to hear the good news.

791
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,919
 Excellency,

792
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,920
 I assure you that, this time,
 he will not get away.

793
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,079
 Will you keep me company,
 Lord Moore ?

794
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,479
 I will take this opportunity

795
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,399
 to speak with you of a topic
 close to my heart.

796
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,400
 - Gladly.
 - After you.

797
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,160
 Get moving !

798
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,759
 Guards, halt !

799
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,199
 Left turn !

800
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,919
 Change the guard !

801
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,920
 Nice hand-over !

802
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,399
 Left turn !

803
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,400
 Forward, march !

804
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,720
 That's good, let's go.

805
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,080
 Five !

806
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,839
 Wait.

807
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,840
 Four !

808
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,799
 Are you not going to bed, Milady ?

809
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,399
 No, not yet.

810
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,119
 But you can go, if you wish.

811
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,120
 Thank you, Milady.

812
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,359
 It's said ...

813
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,399
 that the heart does not age.

814
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,400
 And I have experienced
 just that, in recent days.

815
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,640
 The continued presence
 of your niece

816
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,920
 has instilled in me a feeling,
 both sincere

817
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,359
 and profound, in this regard.

818
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:37,360
 I asked you to stay the night,
 so we might speak about this.

819
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,440
 Then, speak. Express yourself.

820
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,400
 Milord, I have the honour to
 request the hand of your niece.

821
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,199
 Lady Patricia Scott.

822
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,200
 Your request is a great honour.

823
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,680
 But I ask you to consider
 the young age of Patricia.

824
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,119
 And then ...

825
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,799
 And then ?

826
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,639
 And then, there are matters
 to be discussed,

827
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,879
 to be agreed, in detail.

828
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,839
 I do not expect less.

829
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,840
 We have the entire night
 ahead of us to do this.

830
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
 One, two ! One, two ! One, two !

831
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,920
 - Is all well ?
 - Yes.

832
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,799
 Louisa !

833
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,960
 My love !

834
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:59,079
 You stifled me. The gate !
 The patrol will see it.

835
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,080
 You are right.

836
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,279
 - Come on, let's go.
 - Where to ?

837
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,879
 - Down there.
 - I'm frightened, it's too dark.

838
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,519
 Precisely, let's go.

839
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,520
 We'd better put our cards on
 the table, my dear Basil.

840
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,719
 The few days I have spent here

841
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,479
 have confirmed what I suspected.

842
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:22,519
 Meaning ?

843
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,520
 You have governed this colony
 with terror, 

844
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,160
 abusing your power to amass
 a huge personal fortune.

845
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,759
 I have sufficient evidence
 to write my report for the Queen...

846
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,760
 So...
 why don't you do it, then ?

847
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,640
 I have told you.
 I am your friend.

848
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,519
 We had decided to lay down
 our cards.

849
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,519
 Let's leave aside the
 declarations of friendship

850
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,520
 and get to the facts.

851
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,360
 Let me tell you what I know
 about you.

852
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,079
 You haven't a penny to your name.

853
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,799
 Gambling and women
 are your only passions.

854
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,079
 Passions that cost you dear.

855
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,080
 The Moore fortune has long
 been depleted,

856
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,280
 and, I understand, the fortune
 of the Scott children,

857
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,360
 which you were to control
 until their majority,

858
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,760
 is severely compromised.

859
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,840
 Continue. What you say is
 very interesting.

860
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,879
 That is almost everything,
 my dear friend.

861
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,880
 Send a report to the Queen
 favourable towards me

862
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,440
 and give your consent
 to my marriage with Patricia.

863
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,679
 Even without a dowry ?

864
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,919
 That's the point which will
 interest you the most.

865
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,920
 Because I will agree to marry
 Patricia without a dowry.

866
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,199
 At last, there you are !

867
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,079
 It's the fault of the women.

868
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:59,080
 Attention !

869
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,119
 - Has he gone ?
 - Yes.

870
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:10,120
 Let's go.

871
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,240
 This way.

872
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,599
 There is one last question,
 my dear Basil.

873
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,799
 Yes ?

874
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,799
 What is it ?

875
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,039
 This Rosanna Gonzalez,

876
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,959
 I sense that she is intimately
 linked with you.

877
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,479
 Will she not cause trouble ?

878
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,679
 Have no fear.

879
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,680
 At the right time,
 I will get rid of her.

880
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,200
 Let's go.

881
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:26,959
 How are things ?

882
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,960
 Let me see the prisoner.

883
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,239
 Hm, he seems a little sad.

884
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,919
 It can't be too cheerful

885
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,920
 being shut up in there.

886
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,880
 I must go.
 I have to make an inspection.

887
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,559
 Very well, off you go.

888
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,560
 'Bye. Take care, yes ?

889
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,960
 He is through there.

890
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,559
 Quickly !

891
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,560
 Zorro went through there !
 This way.

892
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:44,400
 Watch the prisoner.
 Zorro is in the prison.

893
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,520
 Zorro !

894
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,520
 Remove his uniform.

895
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,479
 - Have you seen him ?
 - No.

896
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,480
 Come with me.
 Secure all exits !

897
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,440
 - Have you seen Zorro ?
 - Idiot ! Why ask me ?

898
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:23,719
 To our agreement, Moore.

899
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,720
 Secure the exits !
 Zorro is in the Palace.

900
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
 Zorro !

901
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,719
 Idiots.

902
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,759
 Search for him,
 he can't get away !

903
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,719
 Back here again ?
 You, through there !

904
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,720
 Take a look.

905
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,560
 - This way.
 - You, follow me !

906
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
 Pedrito !

907
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:09,680
 Let's go.

908
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,920
 Come on !

909
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:29,800
 There he is.

910
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,240
 Get yourselves to safety.
 I will deal with them.

911
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:46,399
 Have you seen Zorro ?

912
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,400
 - He has escaped to the park.
 - Follow me !

913
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,439
 - What is going on ?
 - I don't know.

914
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,079
 Excellency !

915
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,999
 - Wells, what is happening ?
 - Zorro is in the Palace.

916
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,159
 By truth,
 this time he won't escape !

917
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:07,959
 Arrest him, and you will receive
 a promotion in rank !

918
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:08,999
 - Lieutenant !
 - At your command.

919
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
 - The Left Wing. I'll take this side.
 - Let's go.

920
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,039
 Halt !

921
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:20,040
 Throw down your sword !

922
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:26,559
 Hey, you two !
 Where are you going ?

923
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,119
 We're looking for Zorro.

924
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,399
 Go no further.
 Mount a guard here.

925
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,400
 - Yes, sir.
 - Forward !

926
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,959
 Stand your ground !

927
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,319
 This time, I have you.

928
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,999
 You shall not escape me.

929
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
 Throw down your sword !

930
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,440
 Stop him !

931
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,720
 You cannot escape from here !

932
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,800
 Stop !

933
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:08,519
 Out of the way ! Let me shoot him !
 Get out of the way !

934
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:11,520
 - Push him off !
 - Give that to me !

935
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,439
 Untangle yourself !

936
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:21,440
 Capture him ! Capture him !
 Quickly !

937
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,759
 You, that way !

938
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,760
 Come with me !

939
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:47,079
 Wells, secure all the exits !
 Quickly !

940
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:50,080
 Zorro !

941
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,839
 This way ! Look on the roof !

942
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,999
 You, that way !
 Search the rooms.

943
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,839
 Well, Captain Wells ?

944
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,919
 Have no fear, we'll get him.

945
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,039
 Then, go. And do it quickly !

946
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,040
 Patricia !

947
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:08,319
 Hide in here.

948
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,079
 Lady Patricia, open up !

949
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,080
 Yes, I am coming.

950
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,279
 What is it ?

951
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,679
 Excuse me,

952
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,680
 but Zorro is inside the Palace.
 We were worried about you.

953
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,959
 You are still dressed, Patricia ?

954
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:24,759
 I was going to bed, when
 I heard the gunshots.

955
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,039
 I must confess that
 I was a little frightened.

956
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,999
 Would you like Rosanna
 to join you ?

957
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,679
 No, that isn't necessary.

958
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,479
 If I need anything, I will call
 Louisa. Good night.

959
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,559
 Good night.

960
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,560
 Good night.

961
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:49,319
 - Thank you.
 - You must go, now.

962
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:52,119
 - Why did you help me ?
 - Because ....

963
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,999
 Because they would
 have you killed.

964
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
 It was simple humanity
 that I acted that way.

965
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,919
 Is that the only reason ?

966
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:01,719
 Yes. Why do you press me ?

967
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,919
 For your love.

968
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,599
 My love ?

969
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,600
 Yes. You love me as I love you.

970
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:12,560
 No.

971
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,399
 Why do your lips deny

972
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,400
 what is revealed by your eyes ?

973
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,600
 No, let me go.

974
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,100
 Goodbye, Patricia.

975
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:35,719
 The one I freed is waiting for me.

976
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,720
 I must get him to safety.

977
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:42,519
 Wait !

978
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,239
 I am frightened for you.

979
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:47,240
 Fear not, all will be well.

980
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,280
 See if anyone is coming.

981
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,439
 - Sergeant, are you wounded ?
 - No !

982
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:56,440
 Once again he has fled.

983
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,159
 He escaped from me.

984
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:03,319
 You're a bunch of idiots !

985
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,959
 He was there, trapped,

986
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,799
 and you let him get away.

987
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,279
 You won't get away so easily !

988
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,280
 I will hang all those responsible.

989
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:16,559
 You, here ?

990
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,239
 I have to speak with you, Basil.

991
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,999
 Get out. Not now.

992
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
 No ! You will listen to me.
 I know everything.

993
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,440
 You thought getting rid of me
 would enable your new plans,

994
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,719
 but you were sadly mistaken.

995
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,959
 Never will you marry Patricia Scott.

996
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,839
 I will prevent it !

997
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:34,519
 Where did this idea come from ?

998
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,759
 That's enough, Basil !

999
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,919
 You have told me so many lies.

1000
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,920
 I heard your discussion with
 Moore, so be on your guard,

1001
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,039
 I am ready to do anything.

1002
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:46,040
 Even notifying the Queen
 about your misdeeds.

1003
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:51,440
 You will regret this, Basil !
 Be sure that you will.

1004
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,760
 I will have my revenge.

1005
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,119
 Gentlemen,

1006
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,079
 you know the case that now
 must be discussed

1007
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,079
 fills us with bitterness.

1008
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,559
 One of our advisors, Lord Moore,

1009
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,560
 abusing the function of guardian
 that we entrusted to him,

1010
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:13,199
 has squandered the legacy
 left to his niece and nephew

1011
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,559
 Patricia and William Scott.

1012
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,239
 His administrator, Charles Burn,

1013
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:20,959
 has confessed everything.

1014
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,960
 His crimes, already terrible,
 are further compounded

1015
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:27,120
 by the prestigious position
 he occupies as a noble Lord,

1016
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:31,040
 a role that should serve as an
 example to all our citizens.

1017
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,720
 In addition, the infrequent
 news coming from the Island

1018
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
 is not reassuring.

1019
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:42,240
 The power of Zorro seems
 to grow by the day,

1020
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:46,200
 and the repression is becoming
 ever more ruthless.

1021
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,439
 Obviously, Lord Moore has not
 only betrayed his niece and nephew.

1022
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:55,440
 He has betrayed the trust
 that we placed on him.

1023
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:00,280
 And so, it is from the members
 of this Privy Council, that

1024
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,559
 we have decided that you,
 General Kingston,

1025
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:06,560
 will travel to Hamilton
 and restore order.

1026
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,999
 As you command, Your Majesty.

1027
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
 I will sail for Hamilton
 without delay.

1028
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,480
 Let us hope that you arrive
 before it is too late.

1029
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:43,119
 Very nice indeed.

1030
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,120
 My dear Governor,
 may I congratulate you.

1031
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,239
 The idea of putting a price
 on the head of Zorro

1032
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,679
 is excellent.

1033
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,039
 Oh, this Zorro !

1034
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:55,040
 Just a fool who thinks he can
 change things with his ranting.

1035
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,400
 - I hope you will play again.
 - Of course.

1036
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,760
 She played admirably.
 It was a joy to listen to.

1037
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,119
 My compliments.

1038
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:09,120
 Do I take it that you would
 like things to change ?

1039
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:10,799
 Oh, no.

1040
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,199
 For me,
 things are good as they are.

1041
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,200
 I am content. I pay my taxes,
 even if I find them a little high.

1042
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:19,839
 I am on very good terms
 with the Governor.

1043
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,719
 Why would I want things
 to change ?

1044
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:24,720
 There will always be malcontents
 and the dissatisfied.

1045
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:29,240
 Captain Wells,
 we were speaking of your Zorro.

1046
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,279
 My Zorro ?

1047
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,280
 Shortly you will see him
 hanging from the end of a rope.

1048
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:37,480
 Betrayed by those who are
 his friends and supporters.

1049
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,159
 I think that you are wrong,
 Captain Wells.

1050
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,759
 Zorro is revered.

1051
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,159
 I am sure that, in Hamilton,
 there is no-one

1052
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,679
 who would betray him for money.

1053
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,439
 You are deluding yourself.

1054
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:51,440
 Patricia !

1055
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:56,080
 Don't pay any attention
 to what my niece said.

1056
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,759
 At her age, the young often

1057
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,760
 look upon rough bandits
 as heroes,

1058
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:03,239
 if only because they pretend

1059
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,879
 to act in the name of
 an imaginary justice.

1060
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:08,799
 In fact, you are describing
 the judgment of a child ....

1061
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,800
 I find you pensive and let down.

1062
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:15,279
 I understand.

1063
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:18,280
 You were hoping to find here
 a land of peace and joy.

1064
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,960
 Instead, you've found only hatred,
 strife and the abuse of power.

1065
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,439
 Even you admit it.

1066
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:31,440
 Lady Patricia, I admit that
 I prefer the quiet life.

1067
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,159
 But I have eyes that see,

1068
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:38,079
 a mind that makes judgments
 and a heart ...

1069
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:39,279
 I know.

1070
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,280
 Yet, I haven't heard you take
 the side of those struggling

1071
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,479
 and who want to change things.

1072
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,439
 What would you have me do ?

1073
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:51,319
 Put on a sword, don a black mask

1074
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,879
 and start a fight ?

1075
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,759
 Conspire against the Governor,

1076
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:57,760
 like Manuel Garcia and Cortez,

1077
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
 and finish up a prisoner
 or, at best, exiled ?

1078
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,040
 No, that's not for me.

1079
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:09,240
 So you will spend your
 whole life as you now are,

1080
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:13,080
 complacent,
 with no fight in you ?

1081
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,999
 I fight for things that mean
 something to me.

1082
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,919
 Like love, for example.

1083
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,920
 The love I felt for you
 on the day I first saw you

1084
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,960
 and which gives me
 the courage to ask you :

1085
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:31,200
 Will you marry me, Patricia ?

1086
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:34,959
 You are very kind, Pedro,

1087
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,599
 and I thank you for
 your proposal,

1088
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,639
 but, for the moment, I have
 to say that

1089
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:42,599
 what you ask me is impossible.

1090
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,959
 Then, there is no more doubt.

1091
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,960
 From your reaction, you have
 just confirmed to me

1092
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
 that you are in love with Zorro.

1093
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,560
 And if that were so ?

1094
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:57,760
 Take care. It is dangerous to
 fall in love with a shadow.

1095
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:01,440
 And Zorro, for you,
 is only a shadow.

1096
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:05,440
 The quicker this marriage takes
 place, the better for us all.

1097
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:09,160
 I think you are right, Moore.

1098
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,359
 Silence !

1099
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:18,079
 I've been quiet for a period

1100
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:21,080
 to trick the Governor into
 thinking his troubles are over.

1101
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,519
 But now is the time

1102
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,679
 when we must all be prepared.

1103
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:28,680
 We are happy that the time
 to act has arrived.

1104
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,399
 And before risking our lives,

1105
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,719
 I propose that,
 during the uprising,

1106
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,679
 we proclaim our
 independence from England.

1107
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:39,680
 I do not agree. We must not
 act against the Queen

1108
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,719
 for whom
 we must remain faithful.

1109
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:45,519
 The envoy from the Queen,
 on whom we placed our hopes,

1110
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:46,999
 has shown himself incapable.

1111
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
 He even increased the powers
 of the Governor.

1112
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,519
 That corrupt diplomat,

1113
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,520
 who, from personal interest,
 supports the Governor,

1114
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:56,879
 should not make us forget

1115
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:59,679
 that our colony has known
 happy times

1116
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:02,680
 and prosperous ones,
 through our link with England.

1117
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,279
 We will, therefore, only rebel

1118
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:07,879
 against the corrupt power

1119
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,079
 of the man who represents
 the Queen.

1120
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,759
 These are the conditions

1121
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,679
 under which
 I am willing to lead you.

1122
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:15,999
 You are right, Zorro.

1123
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,479
 We will follow you.
 And do what you want.

1124
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,719
 - You all agree ?
 - Yes !

1125
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:22,959
 For now,
 all of you return to your homes.

1126
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,960
 Wait patiently for my orders.

1127
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,919
 ''You are in great danger.

1128
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,920
 ''Leave the Palace immediately.
 A carriage awaits you.

1129
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:59,360
 ''Zorro.''

1130
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:09,920
 - Who is it ?
 - It is I, Milady. Mendez.

1131
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,239
 Well ?

1132
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,199
 I wanted to tell you that
 the Governor

1133
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,159
 hasn't retired to his bed.

1134
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:21,160
 He's had 2 horses saddled: one
 for himself, one for Capt. Wells.

1135
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,239
 - You wait 'til now to tell me ?
 - I couldn't do so before.

1136
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:27,240
 Check the stable and try to
 find out where they are going.

1137
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,479
 You !

1138
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,519
 I was not mistaken.

1139
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,520
 The charm of a bandit was
 enough to make you forget

1140
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:02,040
 that you are of noble birth.

1141
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:07,640
 - Where are we going ?
 - You will know soon enough.

1142
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:10,800
 The other night, at the Palace,
 when I knocked on your door,

1143
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,759
 a suspicion struck me.

1144
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:15,760
 I decided to check and, shortly
 after, from my window,

1145
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:19,120
 I saw Zorro leave you, after
 holding you tenderly.

1146
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,239
 Why didn't you
 have him arrested ?

1147
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,439
 It would have embarrassed you,

1148
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,119
 and compromised our plan.

1149
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:28,359
 What plan ?

1150
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,360
 Your marriage
 to Sir Basil Ruthford.

1151
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,679
 My marriage ?

1152
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:36,039
 Basil is madly enamoured of you.

1153
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:38,119
 He has asked me for your hand.

1154
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,439
 And you have consented ?

1155
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:43,439
 We are even now heading for
 the Convent of San Diego.

1156
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,559
 You will be married there
 tomorrow.

1157
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:48,560
 This remote spot has been
 chosen to avoid any folly

1158
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,039
 on your part, or that of Zorro.

1159
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:54,039
 You would do well to sit back,
 and listen to me.

1160
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,439
 This is pointless.
 I refuse to marry him.

1161
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,519
 If I am dragged to the altar,

1162
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,399
 I will say no to the priest.

1163
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:01,999
 I doubt that.

1164
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
 I have some things to tell you ....

1165
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,239
 Yes !

1166
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:11,240
 Just a minute, I'm coming,
 Here I am !

1167
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,599
 Where is your master ?

1168
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:17,399
 - I'm sorry. He is sleeping.
 - Wake him, I must speak with him !

1169
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:20,279
 I have orders not to disturb
 him under any circumstances.

1170
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,319
 This is a matter of life-or-death.

1171
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,320
 - I understand, but ....
 - What is it, Pedrito ?

1172
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,759
 Milady Rosanna, pardon me.

1173
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:31,439
 This is no time for niceties.

1174
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,439
 This is an urgent matter.

1175
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,799
 You may leave us.

1176
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:36,839
 What is it ?

1177
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:39,759
 Don Pedro, the lady you love
 is in danger.

1178
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,959
 You must intervene.

1179
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,319
 The lady I love ?

1180
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,199
 Do not pretend.

1181
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,479
 Patricia, everyone knows it.

1182
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,399
 What has happened to Patricia ?

1183
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:52,879
 She is being taken to
 the Convent of San Diego,

1184
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,880
 where, in the morning, she
 will be married to the Governor.

1185
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,479
 I must send her a wedding gift,

1186
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,479
 with my best wishes.

1187
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,759
 But ... I thought ...

1188
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,399
 You must not concern yourself.

1189
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:07,039
 Yes, I have a great affection
 for Lady Patricia.

1190
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,959
 I may even love her a little,

1191
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,879
 but not to the point of
 confronting the Governor.

1192
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,519
 This young woman is
 the victim of a conspiracy

1193
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:17,439
 between her guardian
 and Basil Ruthford !

1194
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:18,559
 How do you know that ?

1195
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,560
 I heard them plotting.
 If you were to intervene ....

1196
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,359
 The Governor dislikes me,

1197
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:26,679
 as does the Queen's Envoy.

1198
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:28,999
 No, thank you, I won't get involved

1199
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,839
 It's too dangerous a game.

1200
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,039
 In this world, there are plenty
 of other women.

1201
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:35,999
 Certainly, it's not women we lack.

1202
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,359
 But, as for men in Hamilton,

1203
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:41,360
 there is only one worthy
 of the name : Zorro !

1204
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,199
 I have an idea.

1205
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:46,200
 Try and find Zorro.

1206
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:55,480
 Get to Cortez.
 Tell him it's the time to act.

1207
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:08,199
 It is of little matter to me
 if I am poor.

1208
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:11,079
 I can forgive your crimes,
 but I beseech you :

1209
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:14,080
 do not force me
 to marry a man I despise.

1210
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,559
 And what of your brother ?

1211
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:19,560
 What will happen to him ?
 He will have to leave College.

1212
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:22,439
 And renounce a future
 worthy of his name.

1213
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,119
 and of his rank.

1214
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:26,679
 Have you thought of that ?

1215
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:29,680
 Sir Basil wants you so much
 that he has waived your dowry.

1216
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:33,239
 He will pay for William's education.

1217
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:36,240
 In exchange, you will send
 a favourable report to the Queen.

1218
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,800
 We are being bartered
 to resolve your problems.

1219
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,560
 Well ?

1220
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:02,719
 Get ready.

1221
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:05,720
 They are coming. Get ready.

1222
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:12,880
 Silence !

1223
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:22,280
 Hold your tongues !
 I said - Silence !

1224
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,920
 You - quiet !

1225
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,560
 Quickly, free us !

1226
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
 Liberty, liberty !

1227
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:38,440
 Come on, all of you !

1228
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:42,240
 Quickly, to horse !

1229
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:47,720
 Follow me !

1230
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,279
 Louisa ! Hurry yourself !

1231
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:27,039
 - Where are you taking me ?
 - Climb up, have no fear.

1232
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:30,040
 Don't ask so many questions.

1233
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:41,159
 What is this ?
 Is anyone else about ?

1234
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:42,719
 No... Excellency.

1235
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,919
 Who are you ?
 What are you doing here ?

1236
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:47,920
 I - I am ...

1237
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,400
 I will tell you ...

1238
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:40,399
 Basil Ruthford,

1239
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,479
 do you wish to take as
 your wife, this woman

1240
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:45,319
 Patricia Scott ?

1241
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:48,320
 I do.

1242
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:52,519
 Patricia Scott,

1243
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,520
 do you wish to take as your
 husband, this man, Basil Ruthford ?

1244
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,400
 No !

1245
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:40,159
 Sir Basil Ruthford,

1246
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,359
 you will be dealt with differently.

1247
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:45,360
 You must pay for all your crimes.

1248
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:52,759
 But not here.

1249
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:54,159
 You are not worthy

1250
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:57,160
 of the House of the Lord.

1251
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:49,439
 I could kill you now.

1252
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:52,199
 But the English Court
 must judge you.

1253
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:55,200
 No ! I demand justice.

1254
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:01,159
 Patricia, come here.

1255
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:04,160
 Patricia !

1256
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,800
 Take him !

1257
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,279
 Let me go !

1258
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:17,280
 Let me go !

1259
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,759
 I see you have already solved
 my problems.

1260
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:23,760
 General Kingston,  Envoy of
 Her Majesty, Queen of England.

1261
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:27,680
 I have come here to restore
 order and justice.

1262
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,159
 Lord Moore,
 you have betrayed your duty

1263
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:33,479
 and caused the revolt
 of these people.

1264
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:36,119
 In the name of Her Majesty,
 I arrest you.

1265
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:38,799
 You, take him !

1266
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,800
 And you, put down your arms.

1267
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,800
 Excellency, I confess to acting
 for the good of my country

1268
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:48,119
 and the triumph of justice.

1269
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:51,120
 I am ready to be judged by
 the Court of England.

1270
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:53,199
 Here is my sword.

1271
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:54,639
 Keep it.

1272
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:57,640
 I know that you acted in
 the best interests of England.

1273
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:01,119
 And I am ready publicly
 to acknowledge it.

1274
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:04,120
 But, to do that, you must
 first remove your mask

1275
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:07,440
 and show your true face.

1276
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:12,880
 Pedro !

1277
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:14,879
 Silence !

1278
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,759
 Don Pedro Suarez,

1279
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:19,239
 by virtue of the powers
 vested in me

1280
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:21,279
 and in the name of Her Majesty,

1281
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,159
 Victoria Alexandra of Kent,
 Queen of England,

1282
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:26,999
 I hereby appoint you
 Governor of the Island of Hamilton.

1283
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:59,000
