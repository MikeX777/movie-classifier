1
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,728
'The real deal. The real deal, that.

2
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,361
'The champion.
The champion wife of the world.'

3
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,701
'Sorry.

4
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,119
'Hang on, hang on.'

5
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,867
'Mission accomplished.

6
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,837
'Mission accomplished. Number one.'

7
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,962
'Go.'

8
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,764
'Go away.'

9
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,536
'Cheese.'

10
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,533
- 'Three, two, one, go!'
- 'Cheese.'

11
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,126
'Matty Burton!'

12
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,475
Hey, you.

13
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,765
Hey, you, Mimi.

14
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,438
Yo. Yo, Mimi.

15
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,774
How you doing? How you doing?

16
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,064
Eh? All right, beautiful?

17
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,732
Yeah. Where's Mama?

18
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,605
Where's Mama, eh?

19
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,652
It's all sticky. Yeah, it's all sticky.

20
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:13,948
Yeah!

21
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,992
Daddy have some of your toast?

22
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,457
Have some of Mimi's toast? Daddy eat it?

23
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,075
No? Daddy gonna eat it.

24
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,753
Eh? Daddy can't eat any of your toast.
I got boobies.

25
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,463
I've got to get rid of my boobies.

26
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,254
- I've got bigger boobies than Mummy.
- Oh, is that right?

27
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,929
If Daddy keeps that talk up,
there'll be no booby off Mummy for a month.

28
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,467
- Oi, come here.
- What?

29
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,888
Come here.

30
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,476
Get here.

31
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,145
Thank you.

32
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,270
- I love you.
- Good.

33
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,903
After this fight, I'll take you out
somewhere nice to eat.

34
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,900
Sounds good.

35
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,619
Anywhere you wanna go. It's your choice.

36
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,114
We can go to Nando's.

37
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,241
- Berni Inn.
- Wow!

38
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,585
- Harvester.
- You spoil me.

39
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,209
You deserve it, kid.

40
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,305
Matthew! Mia's right there. It's a bit weird.

41
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,517
Oh?

42
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,852
Mimi?

43
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,391
Come here, baby.

44
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,606
There you go, look. Let's turn you around.

45
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,644
- This is so wrong!
- Don't look at Mummy and Daddy.

46
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,614
You watch the birdies, look. There you go.

47
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,032
Matty, you lost your father recently.

48
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,701
He was with you in the corner
for your first 33 fights.

49
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,288
What difference will it make
when you walk to the ring?

50
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,830
Will his thoughts be in your head?

51
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,455
Yeah, definitely.
I'll fight in honour of my father.

52
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,459
You know what?
No disrespect to his pops an' all that,

53
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,053
but it wouldn't matter
if he was here or not, he'd still lose.

54
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,298
Every single person
who goes against me goes down,

55
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,890
regardless of who's in his corner.

56
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,180
You should show Matty more respect.

57
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,723
Respect for what? What's he done?

58
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,893
His father was part of boxing folklore.
Surely that's wrong.

59
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,267
All right, go on.
What do you wanna say about your dad?

60
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,359
It's, er... It's fine.

61
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,899
I'm just so grateful
that before he passed away,

62
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:19,529
I was able to bring the title home
and also I've got a beautiful daughter.

63
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,873
I'm just glad that he was able
to hold her before he left us.

64
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,208
Has that given you extra motivation?

65
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,623
It's another person in my life to protect.

66
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,872
It's just that extra bit of fire.

67
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,420
Having that bit of extra motivation
is gonna help me.

68
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,134
This is his most important fight.

69
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,380
It's the most important fight
of my life, apparently.

70
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,762
Matty, you're fighting Andre The Future.

71
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:45,058
This is billed as "The Future Is Here".
Do you feel like you've been written off?

72
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:49,274
If it's all about the future,
the past is gonna bite him on his arse.

73
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,067
This guy's losing all the time,
and he won this on a default.

74
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,360
It's my duty to go out there and defend it.

75
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,858
He's never been better.

76
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,486
He knows he didn't earn it.
He is not the true champion.

77
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,364
I might not be the best technical boxer,
but I'm the world champion.

78
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:07,163
A true champion defeats his opponents.
They don't pull out because of an injury.

79
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,911
He's not a true champion.

80
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,288
It will be interesting to see
who's around him

81
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,756
after he loses on the 22nd.

82
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,667
I'm gonna knock him out, take that belt home.

83
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,341
We're gonna dance on his grave
and celebrate his life.

84
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,462
Ooh!

85
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,181
Go on, Matt. Go on!

86
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,973
Shall we wrap that up?
Thank you very much for coming down.

87
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,972
- We'll see you fight night.
- Come on, Granddad!

88
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:32,693
This belt is mine.
Last time you're gonna feel that belt.

89
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,153
Hey, look at me.
What are you looking at them for?

90
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,738
Look at me. You ashamed to look at me?

91
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,615
You want me to look you in the eye?
I'll look you in the eye. There you go.

92
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,453
I'm gonna take your head off.

93
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,745
This is a life-changer for you.

94
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,411
Understand that. It's a life-changer.

95
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:13,816
Hey!

96
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,569
You're not asleep, are you?

97
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,233
Eh? You're wakies.

98
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,982
You're wakies, eh?

99
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,949
Ah, my baby.

100
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,737
My baby girl, eh?

101
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,789
What's Daddy gonna do?

102
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,408
What's Daddy gonna do, Mimi?

103
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,955
Eh?

104
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,796
Eh? Shall I whup his arse?

105
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,792
Eh? Shall I smoke his boots?

106
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,796
Shall I? Shall I take him
into the deep water and drown him?

107
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,967
Yeah?

108
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,885
Eh?

109
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,511
I love you.

110
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,350
Phwoar.

111
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,441
You've tinkered, haven't you?
You've tinkered, haven't you?

112
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,730
Yeah, you smelly bum-bum.

113
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,654
Come on, let's change your bum.

114
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:00,772
Yeah.

115
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,695
Slow-mo. There, there, there.

116
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,192
- Feel it?
- Yeah.

117
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,370
There's the shot. Relax on it.

118
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,739
There he is.

119
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,582
Sit down on those hooks.

120
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,701
Again.

121
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,211
There he is. There he is.

122
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,671
Spring back in with that right.

123
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,267
Time.

124
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,234
Here.

125
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,193
Nice.

126
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,732
Another one in.

127
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,441
Exhale. Nice and slow.

128
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,818
Slow it down. That's it.

129
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,823
Come on.

130
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,287
Been eating Mimi's treats?

131
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,241
It'll come off in the bath.

132
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,827
Let's go. Eight.

133
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,042
Sharp stuff.

134
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,791
Three, four, five, relax.

135
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:17,729
And now to the scales, the WBO
middleweight champion of the world,

136
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,568
Matty Burton.

137
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:27,700
- 11 stone, 4 pounds.
- Matty! Matty! Matty!

138
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,990
Yes! Come on!

139
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,634
'Andre, your best chance

140
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,129
'is because he's, according
to you, over the hill.'

141
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,881
'The best of him is gone,
but I could beat the best of him.

142
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,225
'What is the best of him? Please tell me.

143
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,686
'The best of him ain't touching
the lowest of me.'

144
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:58,933
'From my point of view, Steve,
look, this fight is about experience,

145
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:01,060
'and he's never gone in deep in his career.'

146
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,903
'You're going down.
It's a life-changer for you.

147
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,240
'I ain't lost a single fight, right?
I've had 18 fights, 16 knockouts.

148
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,906
'He's a sluggish fighter.
Just stands there, takes beats.

149
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,280
'What's there to fear or respect?
People are gonna go, "Matty who?"'

150
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,425
Here he is. You all right, champ?

151
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,215
- Yeah, mate.
- Give us your bag.

152
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,338
- Thanks.
- I'll get it in the car for you.

153
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,589
Come here.

154
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,222
Don't worry, we'll look after him.

155
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,141
- See you, Jackie.
- All right, ta-ra.

156
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,347
- Take your time, bro.
- Thanks, mate.

157
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,199
Emma.

158
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,244
Look at me.

159
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,915
When I come back through that door
in a few hours' time,

160
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,288
I'm still gonna be champion of the world.

161
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,588
Number one.

162
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,797
I've just gotta do this. It's what I do.

163
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:14,716
Yeah.

164
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,678
I'd better go.

165
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,267
Can you knock him out quick?

166
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,611
I wish it was that easy.

167
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,279
I love you.

168
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,281
Good.

169
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,925
Spread your fingers. Okay?

170
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,261
- Thanks, gents.
- Good luck.

171
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,887
Thank you.

172
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:41,352
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
entering the arena, the champion,

173
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:46,316
the one and only Matty Burton!

174
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,773
Punch his lights out!

175
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:55,734
Come on, Matty!

176
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,620
Okay, bring him out.

177
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,835
We love you, Matty!

178
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,056
Yeah, you can't run away now.

179
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,769
Come on, Granddad. What do you say?

180
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:38,823
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
it's Big Fight time.

181
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,368
This is a contest of 12 three-minute rounds

182
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:47,494
to decide the WBO middleweight
championship of the world.

183
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,915
In you come.

184
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,124
I gave you instructions in the dressing room.

185
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,215
Life-changer.

186
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,336
I say "break", you break. Touch 'em up.

187
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,588
- You ain't tasted pain.
- Best of luck, gents.

188
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,466
He's got no class. Here you are.
Hard work's done, mate.

189
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,014
Homework's done. Do what you do best.

190
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,761
Matty! Matty! Matty!

191
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,022
Get on that jab. Don't chase him.

192
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,564
Keep your shape.

193
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,194
Get on that jab.

194
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,513
- I slipped. I fucking slipped.
- Two, three.

195
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,485
Judge Steve Watson scores the contest

196
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:27,409
115-113 in favour of the winner.

197
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,622
And still...

198
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:34,245
...the WBO middleweight
champion of the world,

199
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,372
Matty Burton.

200
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,171
Matty! Matty! Matty!

201
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:20,881
- Hey.
- Hey.

202
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,973
I fucking did it.

203
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,718
- Ow, ow!
- Sorry.

204
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,556
Oh, you did it.

205
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,648
Don't cry, baby.

206
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,025
Don't cry.

207
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,530
It's over.

208
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,113
Do you feel legit now?

209
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,785
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

210
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:54,998
Good.

211
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,539
What do you want?

212
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,717
Do you know what I want?

213
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,670
I just want a nice cup of tea.

214
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,766
You're champion of the world.
You can have anything.

215
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,055
- And you want a cup of tea?
- Yeah.

216
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,803
A nice sweet cup of tea.

217
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,098
Okay.

218
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,857
Ow! You keep squeezing me.

219
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,730
Sorry, I just wanna touch you.

220
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,149
Oh, God.

221
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,742
Oh.

222
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,820
I'm very fragile.

223
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,332
Look at your face.

224
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,169
Aargh! Oh, f...

225
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,210
Oh, God.

226
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:09,458
Matty?

227
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,419
Matty?

228
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,591
God.

229
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:14,763
Matty?

230
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,349
Oh, God.

231
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,825
I need an ambulance.

232
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,997
He's a boxer. He's been in a fight.

233
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:41,206
I don't know.

234
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,792
Er, Sheffield, S17.

235
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,624
Okay, okay.

236
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,019
I'm still here.

237
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,314
This one.

238
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,321
It's in.

239
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,244
Right.

240
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,873
- Ready?
- Mm.

241
00:22:22,766 --> 00:22:25,141
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

242
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,396
Hey.

243
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,566
We're home.

244
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,617
Let's get you inside.

245
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,754
Come on.

246
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,485
You're home.

247
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,826
It's okay. Come on.

248
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,500
Sit you down.

249
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,000
- Yeah?
- Mm.

250
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,137
- Get you a cup of tea?
- Yeah.

251
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:35,107
I want you to try and point them forward
so they're pointing towards the steps

252
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,272
That's good. I know it's hard work.

253
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,687
Lovely. Well done.

254
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,357
It's a lot to concentrate on.

255
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,202
Forwards again.

256
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,536
What I need to check first

257
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:51,248
is that we can actually get
this leg of yours up onto the step first.

258
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:54,960
What I'd like you to do
is you just pop this leg here

259
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,579
up onto the step.

260
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,506
Pointing forwards again.

261
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,965
Do it like we do it at home.

262
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,977
- What?
- Do it like we do it at home.

263
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:13,971
- Show them.
- Yeah.

264
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,944
Yeah?

265
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,734
Well done.

266
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,279
That's lovely. Hand on the banister, though.

267
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,743
Lovely. Well done.

268
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,030
That's it. Got the leg position. Good.

269
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,536
Well done.

270
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,035
- Brilliant.
- Good. Put your hand forward.

271
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,994
What are you doing down here?

272
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,540
What are you doing?

273
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,135
- Training.
- What for?

274
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:11,547
A fight.

275
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:13,803
Who are you fighting?

276
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:14,925
Um...

277
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,719
Black man.

278
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,144
- A black man?
- Yeah.

279
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,522
What am I gonna do with you,
eh, Matty Burton?

280
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,652
I don't know.

281
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,572
Let's take you upstairs.

282
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:33,911
- Yeah.
- Come on.

283
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,870
I'll take that.

284
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,686
Um, what's her?

285
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:02,523
It's Mia.

286
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,149
Oh.

287
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,067
Who her dad is?

288
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,735
You are, Matthew.

289
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:11,857
Oh.

290
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:14,618
How long?

291
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:16,945
Um...

292
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,912
From the moment she was conceived.

293
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,912
Basically, all of her life.

294
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,465
We made her. Do you understand?

295
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,218
No.

296
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,930
Am I gonna have to teach you
about that as well?

297
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,048
What?

298
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,427
That is your little girl.

299
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,393
Oh.

300
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,726
What his name is?

301
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,733
She's called Mia.

302
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,272
- Mia.
- Mia.

303
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:50,646
Made her.

304
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,444
100%, yes.

305
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:55,993
I made her.

306
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,783
We did.

307
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,202
- I'm pregnant there.
- Oh?

308
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:03,291
- Who's that?
- It's Darren from the gym.

309
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,251
He's wrapping your hands before the fight.

310
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,087
- Him my friend?
- Yeah.

311
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,374
Who's him?

312
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:13,469
That's Mia, when we brought her home
from the hospital.

313
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:15,967
- Eh?
- Yeah.

314
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,931
- Do you remember?
- Yeah.

315
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:20,934
So little.

316
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,597
- Who's that?
- Mia.

317
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,601
- Mia.
- Yeah. Ah, that's your dad.

318
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,978
Yeah. Remember my dad?

319
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,488
I do.

320
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,652
Er, he's in the ground now.

321
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,441
Yeah.

322
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,702
- Robin.
- Yeah.

323
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,160
- There's more Mia.
- Mia.

324
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:47,457
There's lots of her.

325
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,872
- One of my dad.
- Yeah.

326
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,716
This is us wedding.

327
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,086
Oh, yeah.

328
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,054
- That's you.
- Yeah.

329
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,132
Um.

330
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:02,680
Her beautiful.

331
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:05,805
Thank you.

332
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:10,689
Keep up with the compliments,
you might get a look in later.

333
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:15,193
Oh, is something waking up down there?

334
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:18,784
Hello, you.

335
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,000
- Oh...
- Yeah.

336
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,431
It's okay.

337
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,939
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

338
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,455
We got married here.

339
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,298
Yeah?

340
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,042
- Do you remember?
- Mm.

341
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,638
Do you remember?

342
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:22,756
Um...

343
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,600
You don't, do you?

344
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,718
Yeah.

345
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,766
It's here.

346
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,491
Who's that?

347
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,159
That's Jackie.

348
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:31,705
- Right.
- He's in your corner.

349
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:32,952
Oh.

350
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,578
Who's him?

351
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:37,297
That's Richie. He's your trainer.

352
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,087
Right.

353
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,379
And my dad.

354
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,377
Yeah, you know him.

355
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,594
Yeah.

356
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:44,713
Who's him?

357
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,799
That's Matt.

358
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,641
- I'm Matt.
- No, you're Matty.

359
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,510
- That's Matt.
- Yeah?

360
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,682
Matt.

361
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:54,810
- That's me.
- Oh.

362
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,519
Yeah.

363
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,694
Are my friends?

364
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,361
Yeah.

365
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:06,739
Where are they?

366
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,492
That's a good question.

367
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,074
Mm.

368
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,002
Mm.

370
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:25,629

371
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:30,180
# How I wonder what you are

372
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,474
All right, sweetheart?

373
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:34,892
Er...

374
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,603
There you go, angel.

375
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,725
Emma?

376
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,111
Emma? Emma?

377
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,196
Yeah.

378
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,731
All right, sweetheart.

379
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,332
Made you a cup of tea.

380
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:57,794
Aah.

381
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,458
Thank you, that's lovely.

382
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,922
Yeah?

383
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,040
Ah.

384
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,754
It's cold. Did you forget to boil the kettle?

385
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,548
Um...

386
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:14,310
Yeah, I think...
I think you might have forgot.

387
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,889
Oh, and it's still got the teabag in.

388
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,275
Next time, you just need to boil the kettle,

389
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,645
and then when you've made it,
just take the teabag out...

390
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,875
Matty, look up there.

391
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,296
My team.

392
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:26,337
- Yeah.
- And my dad.

393
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,335
Do you remember coming in before the fight?

394
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,461
Yeah.

395
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,221
And my friends.

396
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,386
Yeah.

397
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,811
I'll see you later, son.

398
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:45,728
Watch your fingers.

399
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,774
Hiya.

400
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,694
How are you doing?

401
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,446
Yeah, we're good, thank you.

402
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,406
Good.

403
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,243
- How is he?
- He's there. Ask him.

404
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,876
- Is it all right if I just say hello?
- Yeah, 'course it is.

405
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:12,629
Hello, mate.

406
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,390
Who he is?

407
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,776
- My friend from the picture?
- Yeah.

408
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,942
We go way back, mate, me and you.

409
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,321
- Where you been?
- Busy at the gym.

410
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:36,278
Why you not take me to the gym?

411
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,572
Um, yeah, all right.

412
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,409
- Can I take him to the gym.
- Yeah.

413
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:45,336
I'll be in touch with you
and we'll go to the gym, all right?

414
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,046
Don't forget me.

415
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:48,210
I won't.

416
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,211
See you later. It was nice to see you.

417
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,895
Um...

418
00:37:11,855 --> 00:37:14,153
- C-c-can do... do the nice...
- No, Matty!

419
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,745
- I want to do the nice thing.
- No.

420
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:23,788
Um, but... um...

421
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,788
- Can we do the nice thing?
- I know it's nice, but no.

422
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,501
- Can do...
- It can't just be when you want it.

423
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,548
It's got to be right for both of us.

424
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:35,716
Right.

Matty.

544
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,172
I'm Matty.

545
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,588
I'm Matty.

546
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:28,303
I'm Matty.

547
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,603
I'm Matty.

548
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,462
Double it.

549
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,714
Good. Double it
and put a right hand after it.

550
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,389
Steady.

551
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:42,728
Nice.

552
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:17,801
I'm sorry I left you, kid.

553
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:18,922
I'm sorry.

554
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,718
I didn't know what to do.

555
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,721
I got frightened.

556
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,454
'Hi, this is Emma.
Sorry I can't get to the phone.

557
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:44,198
'I'll call you back as soon as I can.'

558
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,098
Hello?

559
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:29,956
Hello, Emma.

560
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,106
Richie!

561
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,726
All right, mate? Long time, no see.
What are you doing here?

562
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:56,695
He needs us, mate, big time.

563
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,928
Hi, love.

564
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,601
You all right?

565
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:36,773
Yeah.

566
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,287
Hey.

567
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:57,130
From... from the picture.

568
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:00,672
My friend.

569
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,669
- Yeah.
- What's your name?

570
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:05,840
It's Jackie.

571
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,261
That's him.

572
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:09,593
Jackie.

573
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,856
You know my girlfriend?

574
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:16,691
Emma.

575
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:19,103
She's my wife.

576
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,148
If you see her,

577
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:26,114
tell her I'm looking for her.

578
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,328
I will, mate. Yeah.

579
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:32,075
Tell her I want her to come home for me.

580
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,877
- And my daughter.
- Okay.

581
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,546
My daughter, um...

582
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:41,713
She's a baby now.

583
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,130
Mia.

584
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,753
Yeah.

585
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:48,382
If you see her, tell her, um...

586
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,011
I saw her under the water.

587
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:55,226
Will you do that for me?

588
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:57,683
Yeah.

589
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,571
Are you gonna leave me as well?

590
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,441
No, mate.

591
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:09,904
No, I wanna stay the full visiting hours.

592
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,577
- Good.
- Yeah.

593
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:20,123
Here. On here. Right.

594
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,101
Hello, my mate.

595
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:35,972
Do you wanna come and do
some pads with Manny?

596
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,019
Do you remember how to do it?

597
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:39,517
Yeah.

598
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,312
Hold the pads for Manny, eh?

599
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,906
Manny, do some pads.

600
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,491
So, open your hand up.

601
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:50,656
- Push.
- Manny Pacquiao.

602
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,950
Push. Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

603
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,664
Pacquiao.

604
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,994
Looks like him, but he doesn't hit like him.

605
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,462
- Push 'em.
- Push 'em.

606
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,297
- Is that all right? Okay.
- Yeah.

607
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:04,257
- You do some pads now with Manny.
- Yeah.

608
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,216
Yeah?

609
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,835
All right, Manny.

610
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,212
Manny Pacquiao.

611
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,588
Manny Pacquiao, that's it.

612
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:11,552
Right.

613
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,604
Um...

614
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:19,599
Oh, er...

615
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:27,356
No, no, no.

616
00:59:27,481 --> 00:59:29,358
Get back in line.

617
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:30,951
Matty? Matty? Shh.

618
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,241
No, don't do that. Don't do that, no. Shh.

619
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,864
Mate, mate, come and sit down.
Come and sit down.

620
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,241
Come and sit down over here.

621
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,868
- Come and sit down.
- I want back home.

622
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,417
- Eh?
- I want... I want Emma.

623
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:45,461
Yeah, we'll get Emma.
I'll ring Emma for you. I'll ring her.

624
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,755
Come and sit down. Time, boys. Time.

625
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,258
That's it. Now come and sit down.

626
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,591
That's it. Go and get some water.

627
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:09,906
Do you wanna go out and get some air, mate?

628
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,085
She's not coming back.

629
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,545
She is, mate.

630
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,049
I'm doing the best I can.

631
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,296
Oh, mate.

632
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,140
Come here.

633
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:39,185
I know you are, brother, eh?

634
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,059
Come on, let's get your coat
and get you out, yeah?

635
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,355
Get some air.

636
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,983
Er, Jackie?

637
01:00:49,521 --> 01:00:51,945
What if she comes back when I'm gone?

638
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:54,701
She's got a key.

639
01:00:55,944 --> 01:00:56,786
Oh.

640
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:02,702
Okay.

641
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:10,797
My dad's not here, Jackie.

642
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,506
No.

643
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,514
He's still alive in you, isn't he?

644
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:22,221
And in your Mia.

645
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:33,149
Why she's, um... punishing me?

646
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:36,326
No, mate, she isn't punishing you, is she?

647
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,367
She's just taking time
to get her head together, that's all.

648
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:48,580
Thank you for being my friend.

649
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,382
Oh, mate, it's my pleasure, innit?

650
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:54,799
I'm just sorry I left you for so long.

651
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,344
You can't look after me forever.

652
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:05,348
No, you're right, I can't,
but we'll make sure you're all right.

653
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:09,863
People will think we're married.

654
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,148
I wouldn't marry you, mate. You're too ugly.

655
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:22,119
Let's see if you
can just relax that right hand.

656
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,585
- That's good.
- # I want you

657
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,079
- He's bossy.
- He looks bossy.

658
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:33,299
# Yeah, I want you

659
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,668
Come on, kid.

660
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:38,931
# Cos nothing comes close

661
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,890
- One more.
- One more.

662
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:49,392
# To the way that I need you

663
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:53,358
# I wish I could feel

664
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:56,235
# Your skin

665
01:02:56,356 --> 01:03:00,202
# And I want you

666
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,739
# From somewhere within

667
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:12,089
# It feels like there's oceans
between you and me

668
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,503
# Once again

669
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:17,423
- No power shots.
- Don't knock him over.

670
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:20,218
# We hide our emotions

671
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:22,716
# Under the surface

672
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:26,516
# And try to pretend

673
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:30,850
# But it feels like there's oceans

674
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:33,819
# Between you and me...

675
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:36,905
Right, we train hard, my wife will come back.

676
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:38,319
Yeah.

677
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,194
- Well, you're definitely training hard.
- Yeah.

678
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,617
# I want you

679
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,662
Keep your eyes up. Keep your eye on the ball.

680
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:50,001
# And I always will

681
01:03:50,118 --> 01:03:51,620
- Right.
- Right.

682
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:54,339
- And then left.
- Left.

683
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:55,799
Brilliant. Good lad.

684
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,885
In the middle there. That's it, perfect.

685
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:02,131
Now let it go out gently.
Don't let it rock back.

686
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,097
Controlled.

687
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,342
- # It feels like there's oceans
- Strong.

688
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:08,391
# Between you and me

689
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,933
- Ten.
- # Once again

690
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:13,355
Bring 'em up, bring 'em up.

691
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:16,024
- # We hide our emotions
- Slow.

692
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:18,568
- Clench the fists.
- # Under the surface

693
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:21,908
- # And try to pretend
- Practise. It will become second nature.

694
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:26,364
# But it feels like there's oceans

695
01:04:26,488 --> 01:04:29,913
- # Between you and me #
- Team Burton, number one.

696
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:31,455
Bang it out.

697
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,959
- Good lad. Boom!
- Yeah.

698
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,172
Right, come on, then.

699
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,292
Let's get you a drink
and go on to something else.

700
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,339
- Yeah.
- Good man. You're doing great.

701
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:42,633
- Yeah, my mate.
- You see the improvement?

702
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:44,848
- Oh, yeah.
- Nice one, champ. Let's go.

703
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:47,721
Mia.

704
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:50,345
- She's a small baby.
- Yeah.

705
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,438
With a little bit of hair.

706
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:54,558
I think sometimes when you hear yourself,

707
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:56,104
it then becomes clear.

708
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:59,275
- Just try and listen to how you sound.
- Yeah.

709
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:02,070
'Emma's my wife.'

710
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:04,659
- 'Um... She's beautiful.'
- That's not... Is that me?

711
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:06,278
Yeah, that's you.

712
01:05:06,403 --> 01:05:08,201
'Beautiful, soft.

713
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:12,667
'She's my... love of my life.'

714
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:13,785
- Okay.
- It's true.

715
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,538
So let's maybe just overexaggerate

716
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:19,508
the sounds in the words: love of my life.

717
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,503
Love...

718
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,756
of...

719
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,883
my...

720
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:29,509
life.

721
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:32,809
Love of...

722
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,431
my life.

723
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,854
- My...
- Yeah?

724
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:39,645
Love of my life.

725
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:56,120
- Your go.
- Your go, mate. I've just been.

726
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:59,339
- Go on. Don't try to fiddle me.
- Um...

727
01:06:04,419 --> 01:06:05,637
Don't be cheating.

728
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:17,853
- Matty.
- Yeah?

729
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,147
- You got a visitor, mate.
- Oh?

730
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:44,251
- Cheers.
- Here, my friend.

731
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,518
Some great pictures.

732
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,736
Er, yeah.

733
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,730
Um, that's my dad.

734
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:10,695
Um, that's me.

735
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:13,037
Jackie, Richie.

736
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,825
He's my dad and, er, Matt.

737
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:18,998
Not Matty.

738
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,919
Um, this is my team again.

739
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,464
Had, um, accident.

740
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:29,508
Um, Richie's gonna fix it.

741
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,636
This is my wife.

742
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:35,556
Emma, um...

743
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:36,849
Beautiful.

744
01:07:36,970 --> 01:07:42,522
She's gone away for a bit while I fix myself,

745
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:44,440
but she's coming back,

746
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:45,813
um, one day.

747
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:47,405
And Mia.

748
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:48,523
Very soon.

749
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,527
Thanks for letting me in.

750
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:53,699
Welcome.

751
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:59,292
- I was worried.
- What for?

752
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,795
Because of what happened.

753
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:06,295
The fight.

754
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,422
What I did to you.

755
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,763
Did we fight?

756
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,017
Yeah.

757
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:23,225
Who won?

758
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:27,695
You.

759
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:35,070
Number one.

760
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:43,915
Er...

761
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:46,040
I just wanted to say to you that, um...

762
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:50,126
I'm really sorry for what happened.

763
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:55,173
I didn't mean to hurt you.

764
01:08:56,174 --> 01:08:57,801
And if I could take it back...

765
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:02,147
It was out of order, saying all those things.

766
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:06,234
I was naive, just trying to sell tickets,

767
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:08,069
be the bad boy,

768
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:11,315
and I'm ashamed I said the things I did.

769
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:19,409
The Future.

770
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,792
Future is here.

771
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:31,004
Mm.

772
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:39,319
Hello?

773
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:42,655
Hi.

774
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:47,285
Er, yeah. Shall I get him?

775
01:10:49,871 --> 01:10:50,918
Hang on.

776
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:53,754
- Matty?
- Yeah?

777
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:54,876
Telephone.

778
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:04,435
- Hello.
- 'Hey, you.'

779
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,559
- Is that you?
- 'It is me.'

780
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:09,850
Oh.

781
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:10,975
Um...

782
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:13,728
I miss you.

783
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:15,321
'I miss you.'

784
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:17,111
When are you coming home?

785
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:19,742
'I love you.'

786
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:21,995
I love you.

787
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:25,532
Um, I'm training very hard.

788
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:27,329
'I know you are.

789
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,999
'Richie's told me you're doing really well.'

790
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,120
Um...

791
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:33,672
What else?

792
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:36,714
Um, I saw you under the water.

793
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:39,713
Um...

794
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:42,511
I'm better now. Um...

795
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:45,260
- 'Are you?'
- Yeah, I'm very strong.

796
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,225
'Good.'

797
01:11:48,346 --> 01:11:49,768
Um...

798
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:52,354
Who are you with?

799
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:53,897
'I'm with Mia.'

800
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:55,770
Oh.

801
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:59,198
- My Mia.
- 'Your Mia.'

802
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,113
- Um...
- 'Our Mia.'

803
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:02,611
Yeah.

804
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:06,410
When you see her, will you tell her
I saw her under the water?

805
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:08,033
'I will. I'll tell her.'

806
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:09,750
- Okay.
- 'All right.'

807
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:11,244
Um...

808
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:15,124
- When are you coming home?
- 'I'm not sure yet. I just...

809
01:12:15,248 --> 01:12:17,216
'I need some time to fix myself.'

810
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:20,052
I'm waiting for you by the window.

811
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,513
'I'm gonna have to go now, Matthew.'

812
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:25,258
Um, wait. Um...

813
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,553
What else? Um...

814
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:30,100
Something else.

815
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:33,190
Er... how are you?

816
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:37,146
'Fine. I miss you.'

817
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:39,398
I miss you. When are you coming home?

818
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:40,899
'Soon, baby.'

819
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:42,859
Okay.

820
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:46,780
I'm very strong now.

821
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:47,905
'Good.'

822
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,120
Um, something else.

823
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:59,592
Um, something else.

824
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:01,302
Um...

825
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:03,467
To tell you. Um...

826
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:07,842
Just come home
cos I'm waiting for you by the window.

827
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:09,890
I'm doing very well.

828
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:12,014
'I have to go now. I love you so much.'

829
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,518
- I love you.
- 'Bye, baby. Bye.'

830
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:17,814
Okay, bye.

831
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:23,695
Oh, um...

832
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:26,528
There's something else.

833
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:28,696
Um...

834
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:33,538
Oh, well.

835
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:38,543
Er... she's not coming today.

836
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:42,885
- She'll come.
- Yeah.

837
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:47,090
- I need to just give her time.
- Yeah.

838
01:13:47,214 --> 01:13:48,636
That's all, mate.

839
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:41,523
My belt.

840
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,063
Yeah, man.

841
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:48,235
Richie.

842
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,874
Put... Put Emma on again, Jackie.

843
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,210
Yeah, man.

844
01:14:57,326 --> 01:14:59,670
She were dancing with my dad.

845
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,085
There we go.

846
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:10,047
Oh.

847
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:54,224
Best ever.

848
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:56,309
Who's best ever? Best ever?

849
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:57,554
Um...

850
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:01,523
- Who's the greatest?
- Muhammad Ali.

851
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,641
Muhammad Ali.

852
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:07,488
Cos he made you laugh as well.
You know what I mean?

853
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:09,733
- He was bigger than boxing, wasn't he?
- Yeah.

854
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:12,322
I'll get you some money sorted out.

855
01:16:12,443 --> 01:16:14,821
- It's all right. That's on me.
- Are you sure?

856
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:17,198
That's good of him. No charge.

857
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:18,495
- Oh.
- Yeah, that's fine.

858
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:21,370
These boys wanted a picture.
Is that all right?

859
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:23,963
- Future world champs.
- Yeah.

860
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,627
- What weight are you?
- Lightweight.

861
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:27,091
- Are you?
- Lightweight, yeah.

862
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:31,003
- Look here, Matty.
- Big enough.

863
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:32,550
Here, here. Look at me.

864
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,639
- See you at the do?
- 100%, yeah.

865
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:36,384
- See you.
- Thank you.

866
01:16:36,509 --> 01:16:38,762
- See you later, pal.
- All right, mate.

867
01:16:38,886 --> 01:16:40,638
- Take care.
- Thank you.

868
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,104
- Shut this door, Richie?
- Yes, please. Yeah.

869
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,243
Are you all ready for your big night?

870
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:04,120
- Yeah.
- Good man.

871
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:08,753
There you go.

872
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:13,296
Smart, mate.

873
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:16,014
- How do I look?
- Smart.

874
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:17,850
Good.

875
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:19,765
Let's get your jacket on.

876
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:26,063
- Get your arm in, your hand.
- Yeah.

877
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:28,023
There you go.

878
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:33,524
Come here.

879
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:34,776
Very dapper.

880
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,453
Gonna be a lot of people out for you tonight.

881
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:52,630
Ready?

882
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,047
- Yeah.
- Let's do one.

883
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:01,886
Looking dapper, man.

884
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,857
Thanks to everybody for coming

885
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:10,353
to what's gonna be
a celebration of Matty Burton.

886
01:18:10,477 --> 01:18:11,945
We're gonna celebrate his life.

887
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:16,067
I wanna take you back to that night
when he retained his title.

888
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:18,160
What a memory that was.
What a fight that was.

889
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:20,405
Weren't it fantastic? That was brilliant.

890
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,532
That was Matty as we want to remember him.

891
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:24,579
Let's welcome him to the stage,

892
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,998
our champion, the man you've come to see,

893
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:28,746
Matty Burton.

894
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:47,223
All right, Matty.

895
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:56,991
I want to, er...

896
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,701
Where's Andre?

897
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:01,912
Andre Bryte?

898
01:19:02,029 --> 01:19:03,531
There's him.

899
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:04,953
The Future.

900
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:08,370
I want to say to you,

901
01:19:09,954 --> 01:19:12,924
I don't blame you for what happened to me.

902
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:15,668
I don't blame boxing.

903
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:19,262
I love boxing.

904
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:21,223
It made me who I am today.

905
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:27,145
I'm glad this never happened to you.

906
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:31,441
Because I don't want anybody...

907
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,779
to go through what I've been through.

908
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:38,315
Because it's been hard.

909
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:45,790
I want to say
a special thank you to my friends,

910
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:52,081
to Richie and to Jackie,
for looking after me.

911
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:57,092
I thought you'd left me but you came back.

912
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:02,386
I love you and thank you very much
for being in my life.

913
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:06,969
A few weeks ago

914
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,980
I tried to end my life.

915
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,613
I wanted to die.

916
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:21,446
I jumped into the water.

917
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:25,362
In the water

918
01:20:26,196 --> 01:20:27,914
I saw my wife

919
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:30,201
and my baby.

920
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,003
It made me want to live again.

921
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:38,671
I lost my belt

922
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:41,048
in the water.

923
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:45,307
It's just a belt.

924
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,844
It doesn't mean anything,

925
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:53,766
compared to the people I love.

926
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:57,315
I don't want to lose them.

927
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:03,693
Every day I train hard,

928
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:07,781
get my mind sharp,

929
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:11,538
and keep training.

930
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:13,752
I hope that...

931
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:17,540
the people I love the most

932
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:20,342
come back to my life.

933
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:24,463
Um...

934
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:30,097
Thank you.

935
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:35,270
Well done, Matty. We love you, Matt.

936
01:21:38,185 --> 01:21:39,562
We love you, Matty.

937
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:55,703
Well done. I love you.

938
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:58,547
You did good.

939
01:22:30,404 --> 01:22:33,078
Trying to remember what you're trying to say.

940
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:36,376
It's gone.

941
01:22:36,493 --> 01:22:38,712
Excuse me, Matty. Big fan.
Any chance of a selfie?

942
01:22:38,829 --> 01:22:40,672
- Course you can.
- You're a star.

943
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:43,759
You've had a lot of selfies today.

944
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:47,387
- You get better.
- Thanks, mate.

945
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:48,505
Thank you, mate.

946
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:52,351
What did you hate most about training?

947
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:53,310
Tyre.

948
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:56,305
- You hated or loved that?
- I hated it.

949
01:22:57,181 --> 01:22:58,774
Yeah.

950
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:00,313
Hey, you.

951
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:24,758
- Is that my baby?
- Yeah.

952
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:28,128
It's my baby.

953
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:35,011
Oh, it's you.

954
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:49,949
Er, wait.

955
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:54,788
Love of my life.

956
01:23:54,905 --> 01:23:57,499
- Don't leave me.
- I won't.

957
01:23:57,616 --> 01:23:59,368
Don't go anywhere, will you?

958
01:23:59,493 --> 01:24:03,874
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere.

959
01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:17,103
# But I believe in love

960
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:27,109
# And I know that you do too

961
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:37,282
# And I believe in some kind of path

962
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:47,000
# That we can walk down, me and you

963
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:51,591
# So keep your candles burning

964
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:54,386
# Make her journey bright and pure

965
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:58,978
# That she'll keep returning
always and ever more

966
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:07,013
# Into my arms, O Lord

967
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:11,941
# Into my arms, O Lord

968
01:25:12,071 --> 01:25:17,146
# Into my arms, O Lord

969
01:25:17,262 --> 01:25:20,207
# Into my arms #

970
01:26:19,758 --> 01:26:21,260
Change!

971
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:23,058
Got a big mouth, he has.

972
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:26,231
He used to shout at me.

973
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:29,852
Then I punched him in the head
and he stopped it.

974
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:32,195
- Sorted him out.
- All right, kiddo.

975
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:35,282
That's nice. Nice movement, nice feet.

976
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,822
# And one by one

977
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,866
Say when.

978
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:44,746
# I watched them run

979
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:51,833
# They were my friends

980
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:58,009
# A frozen eye

981
01:27:00,173 --> 01:27:04,474
# And one by one

982
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:09,604
- # I saw them crying
- Fast.

983
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:15,064
- # They were forever
- Do that switch. One, two, switch.

984
01:27:15,188 --> 01:27:17,566
- That's it.
- # To be leaving

985
01:27:19,943 --> 01:27:21,286
Change.

986
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:33,958
Who's in here? Who's in here?

987
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:38,462
- Happy with that?
- Cheers.

988
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:39,714
Good man.

989
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:43,809
# Nothing is remembered

990
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:45,427
Daddy.

991
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:48,556
- # Nothing ever said
- There's my baby.

992
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,978
- Yeah, Daddy.
- It is Daddy.

993
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:52,817
Daddy.

994
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:54,732
- Who loves you?
- Daddy.

995
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:56,651
Yeah, you bet.

996
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:58,490
Give us a kiss.

997
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:02,535
- Mummy.
- Mummy.

998
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,785
Take you home, baby?

999
01:28:06,573 --> 01:28:07,995
Yeah.

1000
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:51,368
# A broken horse

1001
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:56,549
# And one by one

1002
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:02,672
# I watched them run

1003
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:09,140
# They were my friends #
