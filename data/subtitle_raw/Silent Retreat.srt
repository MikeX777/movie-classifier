1
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:20,088
(Projector whirring)

2
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:24,658
*

3
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,419
(Woman) Please come back.

4
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,456
(Panting)

5
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,738
Okay, okay, okay.

6
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:21,649
*

7
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,353
(Rustling)

8
00:01:25,386 --> 00:01:27,255
(Panting)

9
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:29,157
Please, please, please, please.

10
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,695
I'll... I'll do
anything you want.

11
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:38,732
I won't say anything.

12
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:40,801
Please.

13
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,378
Just... please.

14
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,749
Please come back!

15
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,286
Please!

16
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:06,227
I promise.

17
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,829
(Sobs)

18
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:15,636
(Sfx)

19
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:26,914
*

20
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:32,953
(sounds of birds and insects)

21
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:43,231
*

22
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:50,604
*

23
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:11,425
(Janey) Excus...
(Albert) No talking.

24
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:21,502
*

25
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:31,512
*

26
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:39,953
(Unlocks doors)

27
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:50,230
*

28
00:03:50,230 --> 00:04:00,240
*

29
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,981
(Door opens)

30
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,525
(The Doctor) Janey Andrews.

31
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:21,429
This is the only conversation
you'll have here.

32
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,468
To respect the process we keep
things as quiet as possible.

33
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,471
Arrested for assault.

34
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:31,505
(Janey) I didn't do it.

35
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,708
My job is not to
determine guilt.

36
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,878
Judge Prince already
decided that.

37
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,416
My job is to rehabilitate you.

38
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:47,521
If you fail you will go to
jail. So, if you comply, follow

39
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:52,826
the rules, embrace the silence,
we won't have a problem.

40
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,864
Now everyone requires a
different amount of time.

41
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:58,766
The judge said I only
have to stay a month.

42
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,502
A month for some.
For others...

43
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:08,442
You should be grateful this is
the option you've been given.

44
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:12,079
Now we're a family-run business.

45
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:15,416
It's just myself
and my two sons.

46
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,552
We only cater to five
patients at a time.

47
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,454
Our success rate is very high.

48
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:23,357
The rules are simple.

49
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,026
No talking.

50
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,761
No phones.

51
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,930
No Internet.
No music.

52
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,599
No reading.
No writing.

53
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:35,002
No eye contact.

54
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:38,539
No gestures.
No touching.

55
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,874
No sexual misconduct.

56
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:47,615
We sleep at sunset,
get up at sunrise.

57
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,619
It is imperative that
you stay quiet at night.

58
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,427
(Whispers)

59
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:08,068
You went through my bag?
You can't do that.

60
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,837
Distractions!

61
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,773
They cloud the mind.
They interfere.

62
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,576
That's all that's
left of my family.

63
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:18,846
Well, that gives you one more
reason to follow the rules.

64
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,749
You'll get it back
when we're done.

65
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,183
It's an invasion of privacy.

66
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:28,522
Here you have no privacy.
You have no voice.

67
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:32,092
No name.
No identity.

68
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:37,565
It's time to clear your mind
of all that unnecessary noise.

69
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,871
Is that clear?

70
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:55,583
*

71
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,946
(Girl clears throat)

72
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,031
Are we waiting for dinner?

73
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,904
Are we waiting for dinner?

74
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,270
(Clears throat)

75
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,314
I just...

76
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,348
Shhh.

77
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:28,361
(Girl) Ha!

78
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,809
(Kicks plate)

79
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:36,363
(Howling)

80
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:04,091
(Muffled music)

81
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,301
(snarling)

82
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,511
(Muffled music)

83
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,118
(Music sounds)

84
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,334
(Music stops)

85
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:24,204
(Creaing and rattling)

86
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,100
(Bang)

87
00:13:53,133 --> 00:14:01,608
*

88
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,610
(Sfx)

89
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:23,430
(The Doctor)
Close your eyes.

90
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:26,900
Relax and let go.

91
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,303
You're floating through the air.

92
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:33,473
Nothing is around you.

93
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:40,880
Now, as you relax, let
your thoughts disappear.

94
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:45,318
Let your mind wander.

95
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:48,121
Relax.

96
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,457
Relax.

97
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,994
(Girl) Psssst...
(The Doctor) Slowly, slowly...

98
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:59,166
an image comes into your
mind, through the darkness.

99
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,370
An empty theatre.

100
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,139
You're in the front row.

101
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,178
There are soft noises,
comforting noises.

102
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,983
Listen to the soft sounds.

103
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:20,320
(Pink Stripe) No. Let go of me.
I'm not going with you.

104
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,090
(The Doctor)
The sound will disappear.

105
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,062
10, 9...

106
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:25,752
(Sfx)

107
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,377
(Sfx)

108
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,057
Don't tell
them I'm in here.

109
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:26,646
(Struggling and shrieking)

110
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,386
No!

111
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,754
Nooo!!

112
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,126
Don't put me in there.
Don't put me in there. Please.

113
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:42,129
Please I'll do anything.
Please. No. No.

114
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:03,316
(Muffled music)

115
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,742
(Growl)

116
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,629
*

117
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,831
(Growl)

118
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,873
(Paul) Now.

119
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,309
I'm not going with you.

120
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,843
(Growl)

121
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:07,347
Now.

122
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:00,500
(sound of film
projector running)

123
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,745
(The Doctor) You're lucky
my son picked you up.

124
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:17,417
There are things here that
only come out at night,

125
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,519
things you don't
want to encounter.

126
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,855
Besides, we're
miles from anywhere.

127
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:25,858
(Door closes)

128
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:30,463
I saw them drag her away.

129
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:32,465
What do you think happened here?

130
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:35,502
I...

131
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,504
You?

132
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:38,705
I don't know.

133
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:44,477
You have no idea who this girl
is, why she was sent here,

134
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:47,814
and yet you sit
there and accuse me.

135
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,585
We are turning her into
a respectable person.

136
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:55,822
One day she'll make a good wife.

137
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:59,559
We have a two-strike policy.

138
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,961
This is strike one.

139
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:05,365
Strike two - you go to jail.

140
00:21:06,499 --> 00:21:09,035
Nod if you understand.

141
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:21,748
Don't disappoint me again.

142
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:27,554
(Hypnotic voice)
The noises are vanishing.

143
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,591
8,7.

144
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:34,794
All around you.

145
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,796
Silence.

146
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:40,367
6, 5.

147
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:44,303
The quiet is so comforting.

148
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:48,508
The deep silence.

149
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:54,614
4, deeper, 3,

150
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:59,552
2, deeper, 1.

151
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,000
1,2,3.
Open your eyes.

152
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,102
(Whispers) What happened?

153
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,992
(The Doctor) Close your eyes.

154
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:23,563
Relax and let go.

155
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:27,133
You're floating through the air.

156
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,736
Nothing is around you.

157
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:32,839
Again. Again. Again.

158
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,631
(Gagging)

159
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,015
(Gagging)

160
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:22,989
(Alexis) Come on.

161
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,926
*

162
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,236
Wooo.

163
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,307
I've been dying to
do that for weeks.

164
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:44,711
You should try it.

165
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,880
(Janey) No.
I'm okay.

166
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,017
So, how did you do it?

167
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,985
Special ingredient in the food.

168
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,889
The older brother likes me.
Let me in the kitchen.

169
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,727
We probably have,
like, 20 minutes.

170
00:26:02,128 --> 00:26:03,262
I'm Alexis.

171
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,265
Janey.

172
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:10,970
You know I've been
thinking you're a Susan,

173
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:15,975
or a Julia for the last week.
Janey's not even close.

174
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,611
You got the J right.

175
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:22,048
Been here for three weeks.

176
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,219
Got to do something to keep
from going insane here.

177
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:36,896
They're changing us.

178
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,798
Somehow.

179
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:44,737
One day you're fine,
the next it's like

180
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,305
you're Little Miss Stepford.

181
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:51,343
Just like the girl
with the pink stripe.

182
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:53,012
And the others too.

183
00:26:54,681 --> 00:26:57,416
That's pretty much how you last
around here. You have to keep

184
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:02,121
quiet and keep your head down,
and act like it's working.

185
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:09,796
She was here just
before you were.

186
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:12,765
I woke up one morning and she
was gone. That was on her door.

187
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,702
Okay. So she left.

188
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,403
You're not an idiot.

189
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:21,240
They took them to the
cabin didn't they?

190
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:22,909
Yeah.

191
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:24,777
What happens in there?

192
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,345
You tell me.

193
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,314
You were there yesterday.

194
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:35,922
I don't...

195
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:39,992
you don't
remember either.

196
00:27:41,427 --> 00:27:43,229
They took you there today.

197
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:50,002
I... what?

198
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:58,410
Why haven't we changed?

199
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:01,013
I don't know.

200
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:03,015
I don't want to know.

201
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,253
We have to get out of here.

202
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,058
You need to help me.

203
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:15,227
I haven't seen a phone
around here, but if we...

204
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:16,428
No.

205
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,399
I tried to leave last
night and it's just one road

206
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,367
miles before we could get any...

207
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,503
If we take the car we
can get out of here.

208
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,006
There's a car parked
outside the office. I saw it.

209
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,440
Well where are the keys.

210
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:30,376
If I knew that I'd be gone.

211
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:36,315
I need you on the
lookout tonight.

212
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:41,187
We should go.

213
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:46,292
(Janey) We have to be careful
if we're going at night.

214
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:48,394
They're scared of something.

215
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:51,998
We outnumber them.

216
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:55,367
No.
I tried to leave last night.

217
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:58,004
He was scared of
something, in the woods.

218
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,220
The cabin.

219
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:15,988
What, now?

220
00:29:17,023 --> 00:29:18,825
When else?

221
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:40,279
**

222
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:50,289
**

223
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,028
(Whimpering)

224
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,300
(Door closes)

225
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:58,977
Janey?

226
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,581
He tucked me in.

227
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:05,084
Okay, we have to go.
The cabin?

228
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:07,319
There's nothing in there.

229
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:08,520
What do you mean nothing?

230
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:10,522
(Car starts)
The car.

231
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:14,326
No!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

232
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:18,330
We'll try again tomorrow.

233
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:24,503
My ex used to say that.
Tomorrow will be better.

234
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:27,639
She used to say "we'll
win it tomorrow".

235
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,276
Doesn't do shit about today.

236
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:33,112
She?

237
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:34,513
Yeah.

238
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:38,150
Small town.
You know?

239
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,419
It was... a thing.

240
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,324
My family... well...

241
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,396
I don't exist to them.

242
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:57,403
I, uh, started an impromptu,

243
00:33:57,436 --> 00:34:01,207
permitless pride parade and
I sat in the middle of the

244
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,510
busiest intersection until
the police took me away.

245
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:09,481
Yep. And now I'm here to
curb my radical tendencies.

246
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,285
Well, they're right.
Nothing we say matters.

247
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,491
Did you accomplish
anything with your parade?

248
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:23,195
Or did things just go on
like they always have?

249
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:28,134
I tried to explain to
them what happened to me...

250
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:32,838
that he had his
hands on me... that he...

251
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:39,378
but it didn't
make a difference.

252
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,515
That's why we're here
because no one cares.

253
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:47,519
Someone must. I mean,
what about your family?

254
00:34:51,557 --> 00:34:53,259
They... died.

255
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:02,801
The car hit ice.

256
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:07,473
It was night.

257
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:14,146
We went over the shoulder.

258
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,315
It was a long way down.

259
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:22,120
Mom's neck snapped
when we landed.

260
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:29,461
Dad... he was still alive.

261
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:36,168
He couldn't say anything.
He was hurt.

262
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:42,708
His eyes though...

263
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:48,747
he wasn't scared.
He was smiling.

264
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:54,420
He didn't want me to panic.

265
00:35:58,257 --> 00:35:59,891
I couldn't get out of my seat.

266
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:02,594
I was stuck, so I just
started to scream.

267
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:10,402
I thought if one person
could hear me, somebody.

268
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,543
I could see the headlights
through the window.

269
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,812
All the cars driving above us.

270
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:26,952
I screamed for hours and hours,

271
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,790
and the entire time he just

272
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:34,893
looked right into
my eyes and smiled.

273
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:42,868
He did it for me.

274
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:50,576
I couldn't do anything to
help him and he just died.

275
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:53,211
Right there.

276
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:56,582
He just died.

277
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,489
All that noise for nothing.

278
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,826
But you were still fighting,
and you're still alive.

279
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:12,631
I mean, that's why we scream,
to let the world know

280
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:16,702
that we're still here and
that we haven't given up.

281
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:35,287
(The Doctor) An empty theatre.

282
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:37,889
You're in the front row.

283
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,561
There are soft noises,
comforting noises.

284
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:45,364
(Foot steps)

285
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:47,999
Don't go with him.

286
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:50,836
You've broken the silence.

287
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:53,071
I just..she should stay here.

288
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,841
Oh. So you're running things
now? You seem to think that

289
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:58,710
your words are more
important than everyone elses.

290
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:05,050
Go to Hell.

291
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,718
What?

292
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:19,365
Good.

293
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:24,403
These girls could have
spent a lifetime behind bars,

294
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:27,038
but now they're going
to serve society and raise

295
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,975
families as nature
intended them to.

296
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,546
But you... I tried.

297
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,650
I did.

298
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,957
But that's two strikes.
I can't do anything with you.

299
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:49,728
Take her to her room.

300
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,798
She'll be leaving
in the morning.

301
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:37,743
- Is she asleep?
- Yes.

302
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:41,613
Get Cabin 9 ready.
You. Take over for your brother.

303
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,815
(Albert)
I'll take care of the cabin.

304
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:44,983
You'll keep watch.

305
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:48,019
But that thing out there.
It's been more sensitive lately.

306
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,886
Damn it.

307
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:44,209
Aaahhh!!
(Drops)

308
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:49,147
Going now.

309
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,982
Where did he go?

310
00:41:13,939 --> 00:41:15,641
Oh God.

311
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:17,242
I hope these keys
are easy to find.

312
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,514
Keep an eye out.

313
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:47,505
Janey.

314
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:55,581
Alexis.

315
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:59,778
The Doctor's name is Prince.

316
00:43:01,379 --> 00:43:03,148
Alexis.

317
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:08,186
It's Doctor Prince.

318
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,223
Doctor Prince and Judge Prince.

319
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:13,925
They have the same name.
They're brothers.

320
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,668
(Alexis) It's my release form.

321
00:43:23,735 --> 00:43:26,371
It's already been signed.
Both of their signatures.

322
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:27,939
(Janey) Mine too.

323
00:43:27,973 --> 00:43:29,074
Why are they signed?

324
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,976
They want people to
think we're free.

325
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:44,389
*

326
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:46,224
Oh shit.

327
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,666
They're covering their tracks.

328
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:57,435
That girl who left the note.

329
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,237
She never finished
her treatment.

330
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,172
What day was it
when you came here?

331
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,141
What?

332
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:04,275
What day?

333
00:44:06,878 --> 00:44:09,214
- October 22nd.
- What year?

334
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:11,082
What the Hell are you
talking about? This year.

335
00:44:11,116 --> 00:44:13,685
- Which is?
- 2014.

336
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:19,090
No.

337
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:23,862
No.

338
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:28,266
I can't remember any of this.

339
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:31,737
What are you talking about?

340
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,039
I can't remember... why
I can't I remember this?

341
00:44:34,072 --> 00:44:36,875
(Sobs)

342
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:40,178
What are you talking
about Alexis?

343
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:44,149
I came here September 1st, 2012.

344
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:46,684
*

345
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:54,692
We need to find the keys.

346
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,195
Come on.
We need to find the keys.

347
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:08,774
(Keys jingle)
Janey.

348
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:11,076
(Muted voices)

349
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:19,350
(Door squeaks open)

350
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:49,247
So you thought you'd
just drive away did you?

351
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,049
(Chuckles)

352
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:55,987
You're a very bad
influence, Janey.

353
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:02,360
I had such hope for you.

354
00:46:03,461 --> 00:46:05,931
You had everything
the others didn't.

355
00:46:08,033 --> 00:46:10,936
I thought you
were the one for me,

356
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:14,906
but disobedience like
this cannot go unpunished.

357
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:23,048
(Squeals)

358
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:25,383
Bring her inside.
We don't want it to hear.

359
00:46:29,054 --> 00:46:30,221
You.

360
00:46:31,556 --> 00:46:33,424
Where's your friend?

361
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:36,161
Is she here with you?

362
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:38,096
I thought we weren't
supposed to talk.

363
00:46:39,564 --> 00:46:40,899
(Slap)

364
00:46:56,114 --> 00:46:59,117
When she's out take
her to the cabin.

365
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,886
I'll grab your brother.

366
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,821
Son, this is her last chance.

367
00:47:04,956 --> 00:47:07,025
(Squeals)

368
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:10,028
(Falls silent)

369
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:23,434
Please let this work.

370
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:30,641
We can finally be together.

371
00:48:57,402 --> 00:48:59,204
Did she have any keys on her?

372
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:00,405
No.

373
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:05,043
Alright. This is the last time.
If it doesn't work...

374
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:06,344
I know.

375
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:09,414
Now find the other girl.

376
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:33,704
Now I'm going to count
backwards from 10.

377
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:36,007
(Film projector)

378
00:49:37,242 --> 00:49:41,579
10, 9, 8,

379
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:46,751
7, 6, 5,

380
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:52,490
4, 3, 2, 1.

381
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:47,612
(Snaps fingers)

382
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:08,433
(Rattles door)

383
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:11,702
(Rattles door)

384
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:21,279
(knocks on door)

385
00:51:23,314 --> 00:51:24,749
Hello?

386
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:31,822
You can't keep me locked
up in here forever.

387
00:51:33,624 --> 00:51:34,759
(Door squeaks)

388
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:47,772
(The Doctor) Now comes
the unfortunate moment

389
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:51,609
where I inform you that
you have failed the test.

390
00:52:33,718 --> 00:52:35,320
(Alexis) Two years?

391
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:37,622
And what... you're just
going to make me disappear?

392
00:52:39,424 --> 00:52:41,192
You're going to have to
try harder than that.

393
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:43,461
Let go of me.

394
00:52:45,596 --> 00:52:47,265
You want me to be an animal?

395
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:48,599
Argh!!

396
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:51,269
An animal would be better.

397
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:53,304
Animals can be trained.
Women?

398
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:57,342
Women are trickier.
So hard to find

399
00:52:57,375 --> 00:53:00,545
a good wife these days.
Someone for your sons.

400
00:53:01,712 --> 00:53:05,250
A wife that can be tamed, that
can learn to uphold your values.

401
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:08,553
So why not create them?

402
00:53:08,586 --> 00:53:11,956
The demand is there, we
just supply the product.

403
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:16,627
What? We're part of a
matchmaking service?

404
00:53:16,661 --> 00:53:18,296
I'll kill you.

405
00:53:18,796 --> 00:53:20,765
No you won't.

406
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,236
My ex-wife said the same thing.

407
00:53:26,003 --> 00:53:29,374
Right over there after I
caught her cheating on me.

408
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:34,245
And then something evolution
forgot came out of the woods

409
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:37,715
and gave me the solution
to all my problems.

410
00:53:38,649 --> 00:53:39,950
What?

411
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:42,320
I don't know
where it came from,

412
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:44,522
but it kills for
me when I need it to.

413
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,258
Say goodbye.

414
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,695
He loved you, so much.

415
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:55,533
We tried.

416
00:53:56,601 --> 00:54:01,739
We really tried, but you
didn't want to be fixed.

417
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:09,614
Please.

418
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:49,920
(Rustling)

419
00:54:58,363 --> 00:55:00,731
Are you okay?
Those bastards.

420
00:55:00,765 --> 00:55:02,567
I know. Get me out of here.

421
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:05,870
It's locked.

422
00:55:05,903 --> 00:55:07,505
Find a rock.

423
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:13,678
I think I found
something sharp here.

424
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:16,013
Oh shit.

425
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,114
What the Hell is that?

426
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,616
Hurry up.

427
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,954
(Growl)

428
00:55:34,899 --> 00:55:36,767
- Janey...
- Shhhhhh.

429
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:11,669
(Growl)

430
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:16,040
(Rustling)

431
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:39,897
(Sfx)
(Screams)

432
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:42,833
Oh Janey!

433
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:45,069
(Growling, scrunching)

434
00:56:55,012 --> 00:56:57,047
(Growls)

435
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:06,090
(Puff)

436
00:57:08,726 --> 00:57:10,561
There you are.

437
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:12,062
You sick fuck.

438
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:13,898
You chained her to that tree
with that thing out there?

439
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,099
(Punch)

440
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:19,937
This is why I called you here
in the middle of the night.

441
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:22,607
These girls suffer from
paranoid delusions.

442
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,509
Is this a delusion?

443
00:57:24,542 --> 00:57:27,945
There's something in the woods
and he tried to feed me to it.

444
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:30,481
Now listen to yourself.
Something in the woods.

445
00:57:30,515 --> 00:57:32,249
Think of everything
you've been through here.

446
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,118
You know something's off.

447
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:37,655
These girls have
accepted their treatment.

448
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:39,590
They're getting better.

449
00:57:39,624 --> 00:57:41,058
How long have they
been here for?

450
00:57:41,091 --> 00:57:43,828
Alexis has been
here for two years.

451
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:46,196
She doesn't remember any of it.

452
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,866
You told me this
place was bullshit.

453
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:51,001
(The Doctor) They're just
trying to undermine the good

454
00:57:51,035 --> 00:57:52,670
works that we're doing here.

455
00:57:57,908 --> 00:58:00,878
(Janey) How many of you even
knew her name before I said it?

456
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:02,012
If you continue to...

457
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:03,548
I'm Janey.

458
00:58:04,882 --> 00:58:06,250
I'm Sara.

459
00:58:07,585 --> 00:58:09,787
Come here.
Show them you...

460
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,488
Katie.

461
00:58:20,565 --> 00:58:22,700
You would have been so perfect.

462
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:26,971
(Alexis) You can't
hide in there all night.

463
00:58:29,807 --> 00:58:39,850
* Cello plays

464
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:54,331
* Cello plays.

465
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,300
(Girl) Something's moving.

466
00:59:02,707 --> 00:59:04,842
We need to stay quiet.

467
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:11,716
*

468
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:12,917
(Thwack)

469
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,085
Shut it.

470
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:19,724
(Scream)

471
00:59:19,757 --> 00:59:21,258
Oh my God.
What is that?

472
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:23,293
Oh no.
My glasses. Oh no.

473
00:59:29,967 --> 00:59:31,135
(Rattling)

474
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:34,104
(Scream)

475
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,841
Help me!

476
00:59:36,874 --> 00:59:50,988
*

477
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:52,857
(Crunching)

478
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,782
(Scurrying)

479
01:00:17,815 --> 01:00:27,858
*

480
01:00:27,858 --> 01:00:37,868
*

481
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:45,710
(Scream)

482
01:00:58,823 --> 01:01:01,358
(Loud noises)

483
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:08,198
(Silence)

484
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,917
(Drips)

485
01:02:08,192 --> 01:02:09,493
(Clatter)

486
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:04,915
(Gasp)

487
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:10,154
(Alexis) Janey.
Leave her.

488
01:03:10,187 --> 01:03:11,421
(Janey) No.

489
01:03:20,931 --> 01:03:22,799
I don't know how we're
going to do this.

490
01:03:24,368 --> 01:03:26,303
Go.

491
01:03:27,071 --> 01:03:27,972
Go.

492
01:03:28,372 --> 01:03:29,874
No.

493
01:04:12,149 --> 01:04:13,918
(Deep panting)

494
01:04:15,652 --> 01:04:17,021
(Puff)

495
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:22,392
It's hurt by every sound.

496
01:04:23,293 --> 01:04:24,594
Did it see you?

497
01:04:24,628 --> 01:04:25,562
No.

498
01:04:29,299 --> 01:04:30,434
Shhh.

499
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:32,536
Could come back.

500
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:36,306
The sound hurt it more
than usual tonight.

501
01:04:37,007 --> 01:04:38,275
10 years.

502
01:04:39,243 --> 01:04:41,311
It's never made
a mess like this.

503
01:04:41,345 --> 01:04:43,948
It's protecting something.

504
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:46,483
One.

505
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,155
Two.

506
01:04:52,656 --> 01:04:54,091
Three.

507
01:04:55,692 --> 01:04:57,327
Two missing.

508
01:04:58,662 --> 01:05:00,630
Well, the others
must have escaped.

509
01:05:00,664 --> 01:05:02,066
Get them.

510
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,502
I let them go,
I'll get them back.

511
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:08,005
Fine. Go.

512
01:05:11,108 --> 01:05:12,609
Start cleaning.

513
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:36,000
Shit.
He's coming.

514
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:08,158
(Rock music)

515
01:07:38,588 --> 01:07:40,157
(Whimpering)

516
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:53,370
(Loud music)

517
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,805
(Growling, screaming)

518
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:04,414
Do something.

519
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:15,392
(Scream)

520
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:34,644
(Scream)

521
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:41,518
(Glass hatters)

522
01:08:42,286 --> 01:08:43,687
What are you doing?

523
01:08:45,322 --> 01:08:46,523
It's busy.

524
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,359
(Tearing)

525
01:08:58,535 --> 01:09:00,404
It should have never happened.

526
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:02,806
What was that?

527
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:06,676
Quiet.

528
01:10:04,801 --> 01:10:07,203
You let him die.

529
01:10:22,486 --> 01:10:24,554
I've got two more
bitches to put down.

530
01:10:46,543 --> 01:10:48,678
(Banging)

531
01:10:51,615 --> 01:10:53,283
(Growl)

532
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:48,004
***

533
01:11:50,607 --> 01:11:52,476
(Soft growl)

534
01:12:01,785 --> 01:12:02,719
(Crack)

535
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,134
(Door closes)

536
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:19,969
(Car doesn't start)

537
01:12:21,104 --> 01:12:23,507
- No.
- Try again. It's okay.

538
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:25,141
(Car doesn't start)

539
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,010
No, no, no, no.

540
01:12:27,977 --> 01:12:30,013
Okay. Pop the hood.
Pop the hood.

541
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:31,114
Okay.

542
01:12:40,924 --> 01:12:42,792
What's the problem?

543
01:12:42,826 --> 01:12:45,629
They disconnected the fuel line.
I'm going to need some pliers.

544
01:12:48,965 --> 01:12:51,501
Didn't think a girl would be
smart enough to figure it out.

545
01:12:52,436 --> 01:12:53,537
No I didn't.

546
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:54,871
Alexis!

547
01:13:03,947 --> 01:13:05,482
(Locks door)

548
01:13:07,551 --> 01:13:09,152
Alexis, get under!

549
01:13:17,093 --> 01:13:18,995
Get the crowbar.

550
01:13:28,705 --> 01:13:29,606
(Car horn)

551
01:13:31,975 --> 01:13:33,176
(Car horn)

552
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:39,683
(Car horn)

553
