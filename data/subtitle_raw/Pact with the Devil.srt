1
00:02:18,553 --> 00:02:19,596
Mr. Wooten?

2
00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:29,439
Mr. Wooten?

3
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:34,361
Are you all right?

4
00:02:36,321 --> 00:02:37,489
Yes, I think so.

5
00:02:39,533 --> 00:02:40,659
Why don't we talk over here.

6
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,168
So you knew both the victims?

7
00:02:52,087 --> 00:02:53,088
Yes, yes.

8
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,965
Actually,
I was there when they first met,

9
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:59,386
oh, must be 20 years ago now.

10
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:06,100
I was managing Bae Connelly at the time.

11
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:09,770
I discovered Bae in Berlin,
she had a marvelous eye.

12
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:11,772
So I brought her back to New
York and under my guidance.

13
00:03:11,773 --> 00:03:12,815
Hey, how ya doing?

14
00:03:12,816 --> 00:03:13,734
She quickly became

15
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,776
the top fashion
photographer of the time.

16
00:03:15,777 --> 00:03:16,861
See you later.

17
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:18,487
Everyone
wanted Bae's photographs.

18
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:19,364
Oh, please give him that.

19
00:03:19,364 --> 00:03:20,198
I'd convinced her

20
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,284
to shoot the first Sauvage campaign.

21
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:25,077
Oh Christine, forget about your hair.

22
00:03:25,078 --> 00:03:28,122
Please go out for the
rare one, yes, thank you.

23
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:29,123
Hey, yeah!

24
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:33,378
Henry!

25
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,587
Christine, hey!

26
00:03:34,588 --> 00:03:35,422
Hey!

27
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,839
Mm, wow, you've gone all native.

28
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,052
Oh listen here, a
souvenir from last night.

29
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:42,054
Oh my.

30
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,016
Remember Sauvage, the scent

31
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:49,185
that drives your lover wild.

32
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:51,979
Oh, they haven't sold it
now for what, 10 years.

33
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,357
Made a big splash back then.

34
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:58,070
My old pal, Nino Barrachi's
first hit fragrance.

35
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:03,533
Check the flood lighting
again, please Vince.

36
00:04:08,663 --> 00:04:10,123
- Hello, beautiful.
- Woo!

37
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:11,208
That's not bad, that's not bad.

38
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:12,167
What the hell are you doing here?

39
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,503
I thought I'd give you
a little moral support.

40
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:20,967
I think it's you who need
the moral support, my dear.

41
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:24,261
God, what the hell is this crap!

42
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:26,306
I asked for Pellegrino, Jesus!

43
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:30,476
That bitch, Christine cut
it out, let's get going here!

44
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:33,480
Louis, go and get her the Pellegrino.

45
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,691
Please!

46
00:04:37,526 --> 00:04:38,692
Okay.

47
00:04:38,693 --> 00:04:40,861
Okay, positions
everybody, let's get moving.

48
00:04:40,862 --> 00:04:42,322
Hit those drums.

49
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:45,909
Oh, here we go everybody.

50
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,578
Come on, loosen up a little bit.

51
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:53,250
Please some more, that's
better, now get into it.

52
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:57,295
Listen, I want you to be wild.

53
00:04:58,588 --> 00:05:00,923
Come on, think Sauvage,
give to that to me.

54
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:02,758
Yes, and more.

55
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,261
Perfect, you look beautiful.

56
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:08,223
Okay now all together,
yeah, come on, be wild!

57
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:10,559
Yes, once more!

58
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:13,686
Simmer everybody, loosen up please.

59
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:16,021
Come on, I said loosen
up a little bit more.

60
00:05:16,022 --> 00:05:19,066
Yes, okay, let's try it together again.

61
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:21,068
Oh, come on you can loosen more.

62
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:24,780
Yes, please don't smile, I
don't want you smiling, okay?

63
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:27,826
So, please, yeah, that's great.

64
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,579
Now think Sauvage, do that, will you.

65
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,830
That's right.

66
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:35,666
Perfect, that's beautiful.

67
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,711
Okay, now together, yeah.

68
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:56,770
I knew in that first moment,

69
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:57,981
he was something special.

70
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:05,739
As you can see, he had quite a look.

71
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,792
Go on, Mr. Wooten.

72
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:24,090
Well, after Nino's shoot had finished,

73
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,345
I went over to Dorian
and introduced myself.

74
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:31,931
Good shoot Bae, good shoot,
I'll see you tomorrow.

75
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:33,307
We'll get the contacts, mm?

76
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:34,309
Bye.

77
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:43,817
Louis, right?

78
00:06:43,818 --> 00:06:44,653
How do you do?

79
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,778
Henry.

80
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,197
Hi, nice camera.

81
00:06:48,198 --> 00:06:52,535
Oh yes, old faithful, be my guest.

82
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:53,537
Thanks.

83
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:57,206
Have you been working for Bae long?

84
00:06:57,207 --> 00:07:00,167
Oh, just today, they
needed an extra gofer.

85
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:01,419
Low guy on the totem pole.

86
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:03,796
Is Bae a friend of yours?

87
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:06,131
Old friend and client.

88
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:08,593
Actually, I'm her manager.

89
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:13,347
So, you like photography, do you?

90
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:16,850
Oh kind of, I'm more into the
street stuff, mostly people.

91
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:19,770
Ah, well are you
showing in any galleries?

92
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:21,897
I'd love to come down and take a look.

93
00:07:21,898 --> 00:07:24,358
Well, I've been in a
couple of group shows,

94
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:26,485
that's about it, for now.

95
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:27,362
For now?

96
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,947
Well, I've got plans.

97
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:31,950
Excellent, a young man with plans.

98
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,035
I've always maintained that one's aim

99
00:07:35,036 --> 00:07:37,580
in life should be self-development.

100
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:40,708
Realizing one's
potential to the maximum.

101
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:43,503
I mean, that's what we're
here for, right Louis?

102
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:46,297
Yeah, yeah I guess so.

103
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,757
Then, why is it, Louis, that nowadays,

104
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:51,677
young people are afraid
to show their feelings?

105
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:53,596
And why do they forget to live life

106
00:07:53,597 --> 00:07:56,099
to its fullest and have no fear?

107
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:01,353
Well, I don't know if
I could really answer-

108
00:08:01,354 --> 00:08:03,063
Pay no attention to him, Louis.

109
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:06,234
Henry's always going on
about something or another.

110
00:08:07,694 --> 00:08:09,028
Thanks for the gig, Bae.

111
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,195
Welcome.

112
00:08:10,196 --> 00:08:11,114
Good to meet you, Henry.

113
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,448
Yes.

114
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:13,699
Oh.

115
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,034
Oh, thank you.

116
00:08:15,035 --> 00:08:16,952
Bye.

117
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:20,957
Louis, you ought to try
getting in front of the camera.

118
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:24,044
Right.

119
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:43,187
I learned from Bae that Louis

120
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:47,274
and his girlfriend Sybil
were considering marriage,

121
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:50,569
an institution I'm not a champion of.

122
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,864
Marriage makes one unselfish

123
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:57,284
and unselfish people are colorless.

124
00:08:57,285 --> 00:08:58,952
They lack individuality

125
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:01,539
and above all, they aren't egotistical.

126
00:09:02,499 --> 00:09:04,625
The quality that I have every intention

127
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:06,628
of nurturing in Louis.

128
00:09:08,171 --> 00:09:10,255
Sybil, Sybil, how are you?

129
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:11,715
Hey, I'm sorry I missed you.

130
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:12,716
So long, hey.

131
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:13,635
Listen.

132
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,552
- James, I've gotta go.
- Can I help you, please.

133
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:16,845
Sybil, come on!

134
00:09:16,846 --> 00:09:17,806
No, no I can't.

135
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:18,682
- Hey hey!
- Just lend me 10 bucks.

136
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,683
- You gotta go.
- Be back!

137
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,933
Hey, get out of the purse!

138
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:21,810
Come on!

139
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,727
I can't!

140
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,811
Look Sybil, hey.

141
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:24,646
Louis.

142
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,313
You've been there, help them!

143
00:09:26,314 --> 00:09:28,482
Look, here this is all I got.

144
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:29,317
- Louis, come on.
- I'm sorry.

145
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:30,193
25 cents!

146
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,527
What am I supposed to do with 25 cents?

147
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:33,445
I can't get high with 25 cents.

148
00:09:33,446 --> 00:09:35,531
Hey, just go pick that up.

149
00:09:35,532 --> 00:09:36,408
Garbage.

150
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,491
That's all there is.

151
00:09:37,492 --> 00:09:38,451
This is bull.

152
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:39,327
Neighbors.

153
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,328
They stink.

154
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:29,835
I showed Nino Barrachi the photo

155
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:32,588
of Louis that I had
taken at Bae's shoot.

156
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:36,008
Nino agreed with me, Louis
was the face of tomorrow

157
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:39,094
and the perfect image for
his Sauvage fragrance.

158
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:39,971
Go on.

159
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,723
Then, with a little
persuasion made to Bae,

160
00:10:42,724 --> 00:10:45,559
and a lot of flattery
directed towards Louis,

161
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,519
I was able to get them
to give it a whirl.

162
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,563
Come one Louis, yes.

163
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:52,317
Once more and come on, once more.

164
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:57,739
Yes, yes, go on like that.

165
00:10:58,907 --> 00:11:01,075
Just a second, great.

166
00:11:02,243 --> 00:11:03,619
Okay.

167
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,622
Yes, okay once more.

168
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:11,294
Okay and,

169
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:14,380
come on, let's try to have some fun.

170
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,675
Yes, that's it.

171
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:20,929
That's great.

172
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:24,264
Oh!

173
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:25,808
Ow.

174
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:27,351
Are you okay?

175
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:29,728
Yes, yes.

176
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:30,730
Just a second.

177
00:11:32,732 --> 00:11:35,609
Listen, your tomorrow kid needs

178
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,820
to relax and get natural.

179
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:40,781
Being natural is just a pose Bae,

180
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:43,617
and the most irritating one I know.

181
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:46,245
Louis, just take a break.

182
00:11:46,246 --> 00:11:47,080
Yeah.

183
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,081
Good work.

184
00:11:55,547 --> 00:11:58,882
Here, wet your whistle with this.

185
00:11:58,883 --> 00:11:59,717
I don't know, man.

186
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,844
Go on, just knock it back.

187
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:05,389
I can't relax, I-

188
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,431
- It's all right, don't worry.

189
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:07,433
You'll get into it.

190
00:12:08,643 --> 00:12:09,519
I think maybe you'd be better off.

191
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,272
Ah ah ah, please Louis, do not think.

192
00:12:13,273 --> 00:12:16,276
Intellect destroys the
harmony of any face.

193
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:23,658
Beauty is a form of genius
Louis, it needs no explanation.

194
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:26,410
It's one of the great
facts of this world

195
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:29,830
like sunlight or springtime
or the reflection

196
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:33,167
in dark waters of that silver
shell we call the moon.

197
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:36,920
Beauty cannot be questioned.

198
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:38,965
It has the divine right of sovereignty.

199
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:43,469
It makes princes of
those who possess it.

200
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:47,264
You wanna be a photographer right?

201
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:48,182
Right.

202
00:12:48,183 --> 00:12:49,474
Well this is what you do.

203
00:12:49,475 --> 00:12:54,063
First, we establish you as
a world class supermodel.

204
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:56,690
Well then you could do
whatever the hell you want.

205
00:12:56,691 --> 00:12:58,318
If it's photography, fine.

206
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:01,195
Of course, it's up to you, Louis.

207
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:04,657
You have to take that first step.

208
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:09,412
Supermodel.

209
00:13:17,503 --> 00:13:18,504
Okay, oh.

210
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:21,215
Okay.

211
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:23,216
Fine, fine, Bae!

212
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:24,344
Back to work.

213
00:13:26,763 --> 00:13:28,723
Yes, here we go.

214
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:30,515
Yes.

215
00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:32,142
In front of the camera,
he was a natural.

216
00:13:32,143 --> 00:13:34,019
He was born to be looked at.

217
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,979
That's it!

218
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,148
He loved to be
photographed, to be watched.

219
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:41,026
It made him feel alive.

220
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:42,070
Beautiful.

221
00:13:46,074 --> 00:13:48,284
Okay, now you're into it, that's great.

222
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:53,373
Okay, that one looks great.

223
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,433
You're great, man.

224
00:14:13,226 --> 00:14:14,060
Whew!

225
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,936
Yeah?

226
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:15,853
That was great.

227
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,187
All right!

228
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:19,440
That was great, I'm
just gonna pick a light.

229
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,540
I got Bae to blow
up the shot I'd taken

230
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,711
of Louis and then invited him
over to my place for drinks.

231
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:47,300
Yeah, oh, I could come by
this afternoon, five o'clock?

232
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:49,052
Yeah, good!

233
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:51,138
Yes, yes, yes.

234
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:54,558
Well I told you he really
is the face of tomorrow.

235
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,351
And you got him first, Nino.

236
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:58,104
Well, just have the papers ready.

237
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:01,899
Certified check, yeah.

238
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:03,692
Thanks, Nino.

239
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:05,194
Okay, ciao.

240
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:10,490
Congratulations Louis, you're now

241
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:13,410
officially the new face of Sauvage.

242
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:14,703
You're kidding me.

243
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:15,872
Well done.

244
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:18,999
Nino sends his congratulations, too.

245
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,792
He thinks this is some of the best work

246
00:15:20,793 --> 00:15:23,128
that Bae's ever done.

247
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:25,840
I must say, I tend to agree with him.

248
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:32,096
She's really captured something.

249
00:15:36,392 --> 00:15:37,393
What's wrong?

250
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:40,063
Nothing, hm.

251
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,941
Age,

252
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,152
makes me rather sad.

253
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:49,029
Why, is it all that terrible?

254
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:52,449
Hm, by 50 every man
has the face he deserves.

255
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:54,619
How's that for terrifying?

256
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:56,578
You know, I think that Bae

257
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,580
must be some kind of sadist at heart.

258
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:02,876
Oh you wait, when you get
old, wrinkled, and gray

259
00:16:02,877 --> 00:16:05,630
you'll curse her every
time you look at this face.

260
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,884
Henry, are you tripping out on me?

261
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,136
Come on, let's have
a drink to celebrate.

262
00:16:13,137 --> 00:16:14,137
Of course you could always

263
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:16,807
turn the tables around like Dorian Gray.

264
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:18,225
Like who?

265
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:21,520
The hero of a brilliant
Oscar Wilde novel.

266
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:22,687
Champagne?

267
00:16:22,688 --> 00:16:24,439
Yeah.

268
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,692
Yes, Dorian was so handsome.

269
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,362
Huh, glasses.

270
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:34,742
He was so handsome that an
artist painted his portrait.

271
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:37,411
So Dorian made a wish.

272
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:40,123
Ah, whoa, whew!

273
00:16:41,624 --> 00:16:44,209
He makes a wish that
the portrait grows old

274
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,463
while he stays young forever.

275
00:16:48,464 --> 00:16:50,383
Oh, like a pact with the devil.

276
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:53,761
Yeah, kind of.

277
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:57,431
So what, it works, Dorian
never gets any older?

278
00:16:58,891 --> 00:17:02,185
Yes, but it doesn't
have a happy ending.

279
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:03,479
It sounds great to me.

280
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:09,401
Well, you like the idea, do you?

281
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:10,403
Wait a minute.

282
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:15,867
If this picture changed instead of me,

283
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:19,203
yeah, I could deal with that.

284
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:22,664
Well then, I guess that makes you

285
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:25,125
the perfect candidate
to be the new Dorian,

286
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:26,793
what do you think?

287
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:28,879
What do I think about what?

288
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,465
Your new professional name, Dorian.

289
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:34,093
Dorian?

290
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:38,055
A little pretentious.

291
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:41,642
Dorian,

292
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,769
but I kinda like it.

293
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:47,899
I thought you would, hmm, well.

294
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:52,904
Here's to you Dorian, a star is born.

295
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:16,946
Age makes me rather sad.

296
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:24,536
By 50, every man has a
face that he deserves.

297
00:19:24,537 --> 00:19:26,414
How's that for terrifying?

298
00:19:27,581 --> 00:19:31,126
You know, I think Bae must
be a kind of sadist at heart.

299
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:34,838
Now you wait, when you get
old, wrinkled, and gray.

300
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:38,175
You'll curse her every
time you look at this face.

301
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:08,121
Dorian made a wish, that the portrait

302
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:12,793
grows old while he stays young
forever, forever, forever.

303
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:15,962
Like a pact with the devil.

304
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:16,797
Yes.

305
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,757
But it doesn't have a happy ending.

306
00:20:18,758 --> 00:20:20,301
Sounds great to me.

307
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,321
It's a deal.

308
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,000
A bargain then.

309
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:58,214
A bargain then.

310
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:10,101
Forever.

311
00:21:16,357 --> 00:21:17,358
Forever.

312
00:21:42,174 --> 00:21:43,466
Dancing with Mr. D, huh?

313
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:44,551
Hey there's Dorian.

314
00:21:44,552 --> 00:21:45,636
Oh, he so hot!

315
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:56,062
So what do
you think of all this?

316
00:21:56,063 --> 00:21:58,107
Decadence fascinates me.

317
00:22:01,777 --> 00:22:02,778
Yeah?

318
00:22:05,364 --> 00:22:06,365
What about art?

319
00:22:09,785 --> 00:22:11,453
Art?

320
00:22:11,454 --> 00:22:12,955
Art is a sickness.

321
00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:16,250
And love?

322
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:19,295
Love?

323
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:22,840
Yeah, what about love?

324
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:29,638
Love is an illusion.

325
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,811
Wait a minute, then what
do you believe in, Henry?

326
00:22:42,943 --> 00:22:43,986
Cheers.

327
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,071
Let me refill your glass.

328
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:50,825
Louis!

329
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:52,161
Champagne, please.

330
00:22:54,747 --> 00:22:55,997
Hey, where's Sybil?

331
00:22:55,998 --> 00:22:57,541
She was around here somewhere.

332
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,421
Louis!

333
00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:05,341
Henry.

334
00:23:05,508 --> 00:23:08,593
Oh, hello Trina, how are you, darling?

335
00:23:08,594 --> 00:23:09,969
Good to see you.

336
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,679
Louis!

337
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,681
Hey.

338
00:23:13,641 --> 00:23:15,058
Louis!

339
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,184
You gonna introduce me?

340
00:23:16,185 --> 00:23:18,896
Hi, I'm Trina Rousch.

341
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:21,022
Hi.

342
00:23:21,023 --> 00:23:22,274
Are you as good as you look?

343
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,360
I think so.

344
00:23:25,194 --> 00:23:26,195
Louis!

345
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:29,490
Dorian!

346
00:23:30,991 --> 00:23:33,785
I like a man with a future,
but not a woman with a past.

347
00:23:33,786 --> 00:23:37,622
Trina baby, you're hogging our star.

348
00:23:37,623 --> 00:23:39,290
Okay, you want 10% of
this action too, Henry?

349
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:41,876
Oh, what did the poet say?

350
00:23:41,877 --> 00:23:44,045
Shove it where the sun don't shine.

351
00:23:44,046 --> 00:23:45,047
Henry.

352
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,758
Ugh, Dorian!

353
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:56,182
Where'd you say you saw her?

354
00:23:56,183 --> 00:23:57,184
Um,

355
00:23:58,852 --> 00:24:00,604
here, there she is.

356
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,481
Syb!

357
00:24:03,232 --> 00:24:04,482
Sybil, what's wrong?

358
00:24:04,483 --> 00:24:05,442
I have to get out of here.

359
00:24:05,442 --> 00:24:06,277
What are you talking about?

360
00:24:06,277 --> 00:24:07,152
Look we're going places together.

361
00:24:07,152 --> 00:24:07,945
No, we're not.

362
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,404
Listen, look, the doors are open,

363
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:11,239
we're in, we are on our way.

364
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,950
No more hassles, no more
struggles, the world is ours.

365
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:16,369
No Louis, the world is yours.

366
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,037
Look, nothing can stop us now.

367
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:18,872
I can't-

368
00:24:18,873 --> 00:24:21,792
- No stop, listen to me, I love you.

369
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:24,128
Okay?

370
00:24:34,263 --> 00:24:35,723
I love you, too.

371
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:48,568
Let's get out of here, okay?

372
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:49,778
Okay.

373
00:25:22,102 --> 00:25:24,020
So I was thinking of
taking Syb away for awhile.

374
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:26,814
Now wait a minute, we
just got some momentum here.

375
00:25:26,815 --> 00:25:29,484
The Sauvage campaign is
just the beginning for you.

376
00:25:29,485 --> 00:25:30,693
I know but this modeling thing,

377
00:25:30,694 --> 00:25:32,779
it isn't for me,
I want to take pictures.

378
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,864
Wait a minute, we had an agreement.

379
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:36,449
This is just the first step, Dorian.

380
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,534
It's not just that, it's Syb.

381
00:25:38,535 --> 00:25:39,744
She doesn't like what's happening.

382
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:40,496
Mm mm mm.

383
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,121
She's afraid of losing me.

384
00:25:42,122 --> 00:25:43,623
Yeah, well you remember last night

385
00:25:43,624 --> 00:25:46,125
every woman in that disco wanted you.

386
00:25:46,126 --> 00:25:48,419
Yeah, I felt like a piece of meat.

387
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,463
Now wait a minute,
you just listen to me.

388
00:25:50,464 --> 00:25:53,424
You stop thinking like that right now.

389
00:25:53,425 --> 00:25:56,719
The gods have been so kind to you.

390
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,681
For what they gave, they
can soon taketh away.

391
00:25:59,682 --> 00:26:03,017
Don't squander the gold of your days.

392
00:26:03,018 --> 00:26:05,479
For a season, the world belongs to you.

393
00:26:06,563 --> 00:26:08,690
I don't know what I wanna do.

394
00:26:08,691 --> 00:26:10,109
That's why you've got a manager.

395
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,236
What is this for?

396
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,780
Oh, that looks like
the key to your new loft.

397
00:26:15,781 --> 00:26:16,615
Yeah, can I get the door for you?

398
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,534
Say goodbye to Brooklyn,
say hello to Manhattan.

399
00:26:19,535 --> 00:26:22,120
Top floor, and you're very
lucky you bought it cheap.

400
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:24,623
Friends of mine are
renovating the building.

401
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:27,417
Looks like a great place.

402
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:28,419
Ah.

403
00:26:30,629 --> 00:26:32,131
Think Syb will like it?

404
00:26:33,006 --> 00:26:35,342
Yeah, yeah, of course she will.

405
00:26:36,343 --> 00:26:37,594
Open the door.

406
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,017
Well at least check it out.

407
00:26:45,018 --> 00:26:46,936
I just don't
want to move right now.

408
00:26:46,937 --> 00:26:50,065
What, you like this junkie
infested pit better?

409
00:26:52,317 --> 00:26:53,902
What's that supposed to mean?

410
00:26:54,945 --> 00:26:56,529
You think I'm back on the needle again?

411
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,240
Look, maybe I oughta just
get outta your hair for awhile.

412
00:26:59,241 --> 00:27:00,242
And go where?

413
00:27:01,034 --> 00:27:03,578
Henry's, he's having a few
people over for dinner tonight.

414
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:05,455
Louis, it's after midnight.

415
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:06,456
So what?

416
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,126
Come with me Syb.

417
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:10,918
Come as what?

418
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:12,628
As Dorian's girl?

419
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:15,047
Another joke for Henry's
snob friends to laugh at?

420
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:16,132
Hey they're my friends, too, you know?

421
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:19,927
Friends, Louis, they drool
over you like some pinup boy.

422
00:27:19,928 --> 00:27:23,097
God, is that all you want to
be, some mindless model toy?

423
00:27:23,098 --> 00:27:25,433
All right, right,
I'm not a real artist.

424
00:27:25,434 --> 00:27:27,853
Not like you and your
performance theater, right?

425
00:27:28,729 --> 00:27:31,689
You're pathetic, go on,
forget your photography,

426
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,566
forget your dreams,
just throw it all away

427
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:35,777
and go uptown to your jerk-off party.

428
00:27:35,778 --> 00:27:37,028
You know what?

429
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:38,696
That's where you belong, up with Henry

430
00:27:38,697 --> 00:27:40,448
and all of his sell-out phonies.

431
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:42,575
Louis, if you really think
that this modeling crap

432
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:44,410
is gonna be some short cut to success

433
00:27:44,411 --> 00:27:46,287
as a photographer, then you are a fool!

434
00:27:46,288 --> 00:27:48,624
Shut up!

435
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,837
<i>'M sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

436
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:55,714
Baby, come on you know.

437
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,715
No!

438
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,802
Get out!

439
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:02,386
Baby, please you know I wouldn't-

440
00:28:02,387 --> 00:28:03,388
Get out!

441
00:28:28,956 --> 00:28:30,207
Oh, Louis.

442
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:35,127
Oh Louis, Louis!

443
00:28:35,128 --> 00:28:36,880
I'm afraid not, my dear.

444
00:29:07,536 --> 00:29:08,744
Dorian.

445
00:29:08,745 --> 00:29:10,580
Hi, Trina.

446
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:12,248
It looks like I'm kind of late, huh?

447
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:13,500
It depends what for.

448
00:29:14,293 --> 00:29:16,168
I'm the last one here.

449
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:17,963
Yeah, where's Henry?

450
00:29:19,089 --> 00:29:22,216
He offered to take Nino
Barrachi back to the Hamptons.

451
00:29:22,217 --> 00:29:23,844
He won't be back 'til tomorrow.

452
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:27,180
But she's all ours.

453
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:33,020
You want it?

454
00:30:57,354 --> 00:30:58,355
Sybil.

455
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:02,442
Stop crying, man.

456
00:31:10,951 --> 00:31:12,536
Here take a toke of this.

457
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,210
I scored some real good smack.

458
00:31:29,052 --> 00:31:30,345
Some real good stuff.

459
00:33:22,749 --> 00:33:25,669
I got no patience with you, right now!

460
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:30,590
I called you, I called
you, man, I called you.

461
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:34,426
She messed up, man,
she really messed up!

462
00:33:34,427 --> 00:33:35,303
What?

463
00:33:35,303 --> 00:33:36,138
She asked for it.

464
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,930
Ow, you're hurting me,
man, you're hurting me.

465
00:33:37,931 --> 00:33:38,807
She asked for, ow!

466
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,183
Sybil!

467
00:33:41,184 --> 00:33:42,018
You're gonna have to

468
00:33:42,018 --> 00:33:42,853
say goodbye in the morgue, bud.

469
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,854
- Sybil!
- That's where she's going.

470
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:44,688
What happened?

471
00:33:44,688 --> 00:33:45,522
She OD'd.

472
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,939
Hey, aren't you that
guy in all those ads?

473
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,482
That's right, officer.

474
00:33:48,483 --> 00:33:50,819
Actually, I'm his manager.

475
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,612
Okay.

476
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,698
Nice if you can keep
a lid on this, huh?

477
00:33:56,408 --> 00:33:57,409
Tragic, tragic.

478
00:33:58,368 --> 00:33:59,577
Just another OD,

479
00:33:59,578 --> 00:34:00,578
that's the way I'll write it up.

480
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:02,204
I really appreciate that.

481
00:34:02,205 --> 00:34:03,706
No problem.

482
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:05,040
How many times
I got to tell ya, move.

483
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:05,876
Dorian,

484
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,918
I'm so sorry.

485
00:34:07,878 --> 00:34:08,879
I'm so sorry.

486
00:34:13,508 --> 00:34:15,426
It's all right.

487
00:34:15,427 --> 00:34:18,263
Go upstairs and get
your things together.

488
00:34:20,056 --> 00:34:21,724
I'll wait here for you.

489
00:34:21,725 --> 00:34:23,143
I'll take you up to the loft.

490
00:34:24,394 --> 00:34:25,936
I'll be right back.

491
00:34:25,937 --> 00:34:27,563
Yeah!

492
00:34:27,564 --> 00:34:32,527
Yeah, come on, I'm on my way!

493
00:34:51,546 --> 00:34:52,797
Syb.

494
00:35:00,513 --> 00:35:01,514
What?

495
00:35:02,891 --> 00:35:03,892
What?

496
00:35:13,026 --> 00:35:14,027
It can't be.

497
00:35:17,155 --> 00:35:18,156
No.

498
00:35:21,993 --> 00:35:22,994
Can't be.

499
00:35:45,308 --> 00:35:47,309
Dorian, here let me help you with it.

500
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,477
No, I've got it.

501
00:35:48,478 --> 00:35:49,312
I can handle it.

502
00:35:49,312 --> 00:35:50,146
Is there anything else?

503
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:51,731
No, just leave it
all, let's get a cab.

504
00:36:31,313 --> 00:36:32,105
You're telling me

505
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,523
he thought the picture had changed?

506
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:35,607
That's what he told me.

507
00:36:35,608 --> 00:36:37,943
I know it sounds bizarre.

508
00:36:37,944 --> 00:36:38,944
No no no.

509
00:36:39,738 --> 00:36:42,157
Go on Mr. Wooten, I want
to hear the whole story.

510
00:36:44,409 --> 00:36:45,951
Well for the next few years,

511
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,662
Dorian threw himself into his career.

512
00:36:48,663 --> 00:36:51,207
Managing him became a full time job.

513
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:54,460
Oh, oh, we had some fun.

514
00:36:54,461 --> 00:36:56,129
Made lots and lots of money.

515
00:36:57,422 --> 00:36:59,215
Something was missing.

516
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,593
He grew increasingly more paranoid,

517
00:37:02,594 --> 00:37:04,512
the more successful he became.

518
00:37:21,237 --> 00:37:22,821
Nevertheless, wherever you went,

519
00:37:22,822 --> 00:37:25,199
Dorian's picture was there.

520
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,951
The more famous he grew,
the more impossible

521
00:37:27,952 --> 00:37:29,329
he became to manage.

522
00:37:34,918 --> 00:37:39,171
People began to gossip
about Dorian's escapades.

523
00:37:39,172 --> 00:37:42,132
I however, rose above it all.

524
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:43,801
Never once publicly approving

525
00:37:43,802 --> 00:37:45,553
or disapproving of anything he did.

526
00:37:54,145 --> 00:37:55,647
Jeez, I'm coming.

527
00:38:06,866 --> 00:38:08,451
Coming, jeez!

528
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:17,042
What the
hell's going on, Dorian?

529
00:38:17,043 --> 00:38:19,295
You were due at the
studio two hours ago.

530
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:21,297
Yeah.

531
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:24,300
Overslept.

532
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:28,847
Tell them I'm, tell them I'm sick.

533
00:38:30,348 --> 00:38:32,600
It's too late,
they canceled the shoot.

534
00:38:34,394 --> 00:38:36,354
And there'll be no check in the mail!

535
00:38:39,107 --> 00:38:40,567
Oh, yeah I need a shower.

536
00:38:44,404 --> 00:38:46,196
Whenever interviewed I'd say,

537
00:38:46,197 --> 00:38:47,614
we're not sent into the world

538
00:38:47,615 --> 00:38:50,034
to air our model prejudices.

539
00:38:51,286 --> 00:38:53,829
Hence, I never take any
notice of what the press

540
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,998
or common people say.

541
00:38:55,999 --> 00:39:00,211
And I never interfere with
what common people do.

542
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:03,298
You make any coffee?

543
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,966
Not me.

544
00:39:10,972 --> 00:39:12,265
Hey, do you mind?

545
00:39:12,849 --> 00:39:13,850
No.

546
00:39:16,227 --> 00:39:17,728
Are there any more?

547
00:39:17,729 --> 00:39:20,481
I gotta split, have a nice day.

548
00:39:20,482 --> 00:39:21,732
Have a nice day.

549
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:23,567
And I will see you later.

550
00:39:23,568 --> 00:39:25,987
Hey, wait up, I'm coming with you.

551
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:36,413
What?

552
00:39:43,796 --> 00:39:45,673
Dorian, I'm worried about you.

553
00:39:46,633 --> 00:39:48,800
You're out partying every night.

554
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:52,764
Yeah, I still look
okay, don't I, don't I?

555
00:39:53,097 --> 00:39:56,642
Yes, yes, of course, you're just not-

556
00:39:56,643 --> 00:39:57,477
- Not what?

557
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,936
Not as good as when you first met me?

558
00:39:58,937 --> 00:40:00,687
No, you're fine.

559
00:40:00,688 --> 00:40:02,606
That's right, I'm fine
because there's no bags

560
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:04,483
under my eyes and no lines up
here, right?

561
00:40:04,484 --> 00:40:05,984
What the hell is going on with you?

562
00:40:05,985 --> 00:40:07,402
You want to know what's going on?

563
00:40:07,403 --> 00:40:08,947
Come on Henry, I'll show you.

564
00:40:10,615 --> 00:40:11,616
Come on!

565
00:40:14,118 --> 00:40:17,205
This, this is what's going on.

566
00:40:26,673 --> 00:40:27,882
Oh my God.

567
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:36,224
What happened to it?

568
00:40:38,601 --> 00:40:40,686
When did it start transforming?

569
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:44,023
I saw it first just
after Sybil passed on.

570
00:40:45,316 --> 00:40:46,484
It's gotten worse.

571
00:40:47,694 --> 00:40:49,529
It's truly amazing.

572
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:53,408
It's like that bullshit
story you told me.

573
00:40:55,034 --> 00:40:56,286
About the other Dorian.

574
00:40:59,038 --> 00:41:01,123
I know it's hard to believe but it,

575
00:41:01,124 --> 00:41:02,667
it's like it's happening to me.

576
00:41:04,127 --> 00:41:08,673
I can believe anything
providing it's truly incredible.

577
00:41:10,675 --> 00:41:12,302
This is not what I wanted.

578
00:41:13,219 --> 00:41:15,053
You can have whatever you
want, Dorian.

579
00:41:15,054 --> 00:41:17,222
Life has everything in store for you.

580
00:41:17,223 --> 00:41:19,600
With that face, there's
nothing you can't have.

581
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:22,311
You're the luckiest man
in the world, Dorian.

582
00:41:22,312 --> 00:41:25,814
There are no limits
with that sweet smile,

583
00:41:25,815 --> 00:41:31,362
the boyish grin,
forever Dorian, forever.

584
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:35,073
We can go all the way, we
can rule this business!

585
00:41:35,074 --> 00:41:36,950
Now it's up to you,

586
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:40,330
do you want to play?

587
00:41:43,499 --> 00:41:44,500
Yes.

588
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:53,760
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

589
00:41:54,218 --> 00:41:56,011
Go on, go get dressed, go on.

590
00:41:56,012 --> 00:41:57,554
We have to go see Bae.

591
00:41:57,555 --> 00:41:58,639
Why?

592
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,432
I've got a deal with Diana Baxter.

593
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:01,600
Ever heard of her?

594
00:42:01,601 --> 00:42:03,143
No.

595
00:42:03,144 --> 00:42:07,272
No, no, Diana publishes
books, coffee table books.

596
00:42:07,273 --> 00:42:10,359
Elegant, yuppie very expensive.

597
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,568
So?

598
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:14,529
So I've convinced her
to do a book about you.

599
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,365
You know, top model's real life,

600
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:19,618
the naked truth behind the
glamor, that sort of bull, ha.

601
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:22,080
I think she'll go along
with it under one condition.

602
00:42:23,122 --> 00:42:25,248
She wants Bae to do the photographs

603
00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:28,378
so if we can sign Bae on,

604
00:42:30,338 --> 00:42:31,881
we've got ourselves a

605
00:42:33,841 --> 00:42:35,343
six figure deal.

606
00:42:40,515 --> 00:42:41,807
So what's the title of the book?

607
00:42:41,808 --> 00:42:44,810
Hold on, "Dorian, A Model Life."

608
00:42:44,811 --> 00:42:46,812
Diana thinks it's going to be huge.

609
00:42:46,813 --> 00:42:49,731
Especially if you do the photographs.

610
00:42:49,732 --> 00:42:50,774
Me?

611
00:42:50,775 --> 00:42:51,609
What?

612
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,777
No, no, no, I want you Bae.

613
00:42:53,778 --> 00:42:55,195
You're the best.

614
00:42:55,196 --> 00:42:57,864
Your tastes, your aesthetic.

615
00:42:57,865 --> 00:43:00,243
Come on, I really wanna
work with you again.

616
00:43:01,411 --> 00:43:02,412
What do you say?

617
00:43:03,413 --> 00:43:05,540
All the artistic
decisions will be yours.

618
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:08,917
And Dorian's of course.

619
00:43:08,918 --> 00:43:10,253
No interference from anyone.

620
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:14,340
Please.

621
00:43:16,384 --> 00:43:17,592
Okay.

622
00:43:17,593 --> 00:43:19,554
There you go, there you go, come here.

623
00:43:21,472 --> 00:43:22,890
We're gonna have a great time.

624
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:26,518
Dorian and Bae
got to work together again.

625
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:27,562
It was heaven for them.

626
00:43:29,814 --> 00:43:34,443
Somehow, Bae was able to
help Dorian temper his ways

627
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:38,447
and bring out the Louis that
was buried deep inside him.

628
00:43:38,448 --> 00:43:41,116
What do you really want, Dorian?

629
00:43:41,117 --> 00:43:43,160
To finish this book, mm-hm.

630
00:43:43,161 --> 00:43:44,494
And then?

631
00:43:44,495 --> 00:43:47,205
Sell a billion copies,
get rich and famous.

632
00:43:47,206 --> 00:43:50,625
License my name out to
sheets, towels, underwear.

633
00:43:50,626 --> 00:43:52,919
Retire to a life with pure access.

634
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,337
That's what Henry wants.

635
00:43:54,338 --> 00:43:56,214
I thought you wanted to take pictures?

636
00:43:56,215 --> 00:43:57,632
I do.

637
00:43:57,633 --> 00:43:59,259
So what changed?

638
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,469
Nothing, I'm still going to

639
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:01,971
but not until the time's right.

640
00:44:03,681 --> 00:44:05,182
When would that be?

641
00:44:05,183 --> 00:44:06,601
I'm not sure, Henry-

642
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:08,269
Henry.

643
00:44:08,644 --> 00:44:10,396
How long have you known Henry for?

644
00:44:10,772 --> 00:44:14,441
Hm, for an eternity.

645
00:44:14,442 --> 00:44:15,902
I was one of his first clients.

646
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:18,487
Really?

647
00:44:18,488 --> 00:44:20,155
Has he had many clients?

648
00:44:20,156 --> 00:44:21,532
Only a very select few.

649
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:25,411
I guess that makes me one
of the lucky few, right?

650
00:44:26,662 --> 00:44:28,205
Guess so.

651
00:44:28,206 --> 00:44:30,123
Henry says you're a hermit.

652
00:44:30,124 --> 00:44:31,374
And me I've got to stay out there

653
00:44:31,375 --> 00:44:33,252
and make the scene be visible.

654
00:44:34,796 --> 00:44:36,296
Sure thing.

655
00:44:36,297 --> 00:44:37,340
Look, we're a team.

656
00:44:37,882 --> 00:44:39,424
I'm happy right now having fun.

657
00:44:39,425 --> 00:44:41,593
Good times, excitement.

658
00:44:41,594 --> 00:44:42,470
Dorian.

659
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:45,222
That's what I like, Bae,
it's what comes easy for me.

660
00:44:45,223 --> 00:44:48,267
Walk into a room, and I can
feel people's eyes all over me.

661
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:51,771
It's what Henry says
the world's all about.

662
00:44:53,898 --> 00:44:54,899
Be careful.

663
00:44:56,317 --> 00:44:58,360
I thought you liked Henry.

664
00:44:58,361 --> 00:44:59,362
I do.

665
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:02,281
I do, but what?

666
00:45:03,407 --> 00:45:05,283
I don't like what he does to you.

667
00:45:05,284 --> 00:45:06,118
What he wants you to be.

668
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:07,829
You're better than that, Dorian.

669
00:45:09,288 --> 00:45:12,916
Henry's all right, he
only offers me choices.

670
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:14,584
I'm the one that makes the decisions.

671
00:45:14,585 --> 00:45:15,669
Are you sure of that?

672
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:17,712
Yeah, of course I am.

673
00:45:17,713 --> 00:45:18,881
He works for me.

674
00:45:23,928 --> 00:45:25,595
I wonder what Henry would think?

675
00:45:25,596 --> 00:45:26,638
He wouldn't be happy.

676
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:28,891
No, no he would not be happy.

677
00:45:32,353 --> 00:45:33,396
Enough about Henry.

678
00:45:38,317 --> 00:45:40,194
Maybe you need to be in another world.

679
00:45:42,947 --> 00:45:43,990
Yeah.

680
00:45:45,324 --> 00:45:46,325
Yeah, maybe.

681
00:46:05,303 --> 00:46:07,971
Please promise me, that if you ever

682
00:46:07,972 --> 00:46:11,809
need to speak or whatever,
you'll come to me.

683
00:46:14,145 --> 00:46:17,440
Yeah, yeah sure, I promise.

684
00:47:13,913 --> 00:47:15,455
What can I say?

685
00:47:15,456 --> 00:47:16,457
I love her.

686
00:47:20,252 --> 00:47:21,253
In love?

687
00:47:24,215 --> 00:47:25,591
With Bae?

688
00:47:33,557 --> 00:47:36,226
Are you insane?

689
00:47:36,227 --> 00:47:37,228
What?

690
00:47:37,728 --> 00:47:39,104
It just happened.

691
00:47:39,105 --> 00:47:40,939
Working together on the book.

692
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,817
What do you want to do, marry her?

693
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:45,402
Why not?

694
00:47:45,403 --> 00:47:46,946
I love Bae and she loves me.

695
00:47:48,614 --> 00:47:49,615
Why not?

696
00:47:51,534 --> 00:47:53,119
I'll show you, why not.

697
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:00,626
Henry!

698
00:48:02,253 --> 00:48:03,254
Stop it!

699
00:48:05,423 --> 00:48:08,800
Here, this is why not.

700
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:10,260
Has Bae seen this?

701
00:48:10,261 --> 00:48:13,304
Or does she think that face
you're wearing is your real one?

702
00:48:13,305 --> 00:48:14,681
Hey, she loves me!

703
00:48:14,682 --> 00:48:15,765
Loves you?

704
00:48:15,766 --> 00:48:17,851
What are you talking about,
she doesn't even know you.

705
00:48:17,852 --> 00:48:19,270
That is you!

706
00:48:19,937 --> 00:48:20,980
Henry!

707
00:48:22,523 --> 00:48:25,859
Oh, let's show Bae the
real you, mm, shall we?

708
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,528
Should we call her
up, get her over here.

709
00:48:28,529 --> 00:48:30,447
Yeah, I'll get her over here right now.

710
00:48:30,448 --> 00:48:32,407
- I'll just call her.
- Henry!

711
00:48:32,408 --> 00:48:33,284
I know she's in.

712
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,451
- Got to get her over now.
- Henry, give me that!

713
00:48:34,452 --> 00:48:36,828
Look, I like working with her, okay?

714
00:48:36,829 --> 00:48:38,079
You know how great Bae is.

715
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,041
Oh, I see so you want a new career

716
00:48:41,042 --> 00:48:42,792
as Bae's camera assistant?

717
00:48:42,793 --> 00:48:45,295
No, she's gonna help
me with my photography.

718
00:48:45,296 --> 00:48:47,047
Look Dorian, you've got a book

719
00:48:47,048 --> 00:48:48,131
coming out at the end of next week.

720
00:48:48,132 --> 00:48:50,800
50,000 copies pre-sold worldwide.

721
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:53,220
That's your career, that's what,

722
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,016
that's what we both worked for.

723
00:48:58,017 --> 00:49:00,186
Enough, enough.

724
00:49:01,145 --> 00:49:03,856
I just want a normal life.

725
00:49:05,524 --> 00:49:07,317
A normal life.

726
00:49:07,318 --> 00:49:11,321
Ah, you want a nice normal life.

727
00:49:11,322 --> 00:49:12,363
Yeah.

728
00:49:12,364 --> 00:49:13,365
Mm, mm.

729
00:49:14,325 --> 00:49:18,536
Ah, so you're gonna marry
Bae and move to New Jersey

730
00:49:18,537 --> 00:49:21,165
have a couple of sniveling kids?

731
00:49:23,167 --> 00:49:24,209
Yes.

732
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:27,295
So, you want to be ordinary, Dorian.

733
00:49:27,296 --> 00:49:30,049
All right, well,
I can make you ordinary.

734
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:34,636
I can make you completely,
inescapably ordinary.

735
00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:37,514
Henry, Henry, don't, Henry!

736
00:49:37,515 --> 00:49:39,599
Take one last look at that picture.

737
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:42,811
Because in two seconds flat,
that's gonna be your face.

738
00:49:42,812 --> 00:49:44,355
No!

739
00:49:46,774 --> 00:49:51,237
Leave it alone Henry, that's my picture!

740
00:49:53,948 --> 00:49:55,199
It's me.

741
00:49:58,911 --> 00:50:02,915
Of course, Dorian, anything you say.

742
00:50:10,548 --> 00:50:11,923
Thank you.

743
00:50:11,924 --> 00:50:13,800
So what do we do about Bae?

744
00:50:13,801 --> 00:50:15,261
Oh, don't worry about that.

745
00:50:16,512 --> 00:50:18,347
I'll take care of her, my boy.

746
00:51:22,912 --> 00:51:24,370
Looks like we got a winner, Henry.

747
00:51:24,371 --> 00:51:25,372
Oh, I hope so.

748
00:51:26,207 --> 00:51:28,459
Thanks for convincing
me to publish it.

749
00:51:30,211 --> 00:51:31,377
I still don't understand why you

750
00:51:31,378 --> 00:51:33,254
didn't want your name on the book.

751
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:34,797
It's Dorian's creation, Diana.

752
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:36,091
You created Dorian.

753
00:51:36,926 --> 00:51:38,468
If you say so.

754
00:51:38,469 --> 00:51:39,844
Take the credit.

755
00:51:39,845 --> 00:51:41,888
Reveal the art, conceal the artist.

756
00:51:41,889 --> 00:51:44,557
That's the trick Diana,
that's the trick.

757
00:51:44,558 --> 00:51:46,559
Dorian's your work of art?

758
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,561
Yes.

759
00:51:50,189 --> 00:51:51,315
Just look at him.

760
00:51:53,817 --> 00:51:56,945
Dorian, it's been years.

761
00:51:56,946 --> 00:51:59,239
You haven't changed a bit.

762
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,573
Trina, baby.

763
00:52:00,574 --> 00:52:01,991
I am pissed off at you.

764
00:52:01,992 --> 00:52:02,868
Really?

765
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:06,037
Really, I checked the index,
and I'm not listed anywhere.

766
00:52:06,038 --> 00:52:07,164
Baby, count your blessings.

767
00:52:08,082 --> 00:52:10,458
Oh and Bae, the photos are gorgeous.

768
00:52:10,459 --> 00:52:12,502
Nobody's ever captured you like that.

769
00:52:12,503 --> 00:52:15,130
It's like you two were
meant for each other.

770
00:52:19,843 --> 00:52:20,844
Excuse me.

771
00:52:22,471 --> 00:52:25,682
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
you two were an item.

772
00:52:25,683 --> 00:52:26,850
Fling.

773
00:52:27,726 --> 00:52:28,768
Henry!

774
00:52:28,769 --> 00:52:29,979
Dorian, Trina.

775
00:52:33,315 --> 00:52:36,109
May I introduce you to Mariel la Steiner,

776
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:38,861
she's married to one of
my oldest friends, Rolf.

777
00:52:38,862 --> 00:52:40,280
Oh good for you,
honey, one of the richest

778
00:52:40,281 --> 00:52:42,574
men in Europe, very impressive.

779
00:52:44,451 --> 00:52:46,577
Dorian, Henry told me this would be

780
00:52:46,578 --> 00:52:48,788
the book launching of the season.

781
00:52:48,789 --> 00:52:50,666
Well, we certainly hope so.

782
00:52:54,336 --> 00:52:56,296
- Enchante.
- It's quite the book.

783
00:52:56,297 --> 00:52:57,964
Oh, you've read it?

784
00:52:57,965 --> 00:53:00,134
No, I looked at the pictures.

785
00:53:03,178 --> 00:53:05,388
Oh, you must meet the photographer.

786
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:08,309
Yes, unfortunately our
dear Bae had to leave.

787
00:53:09,476 --> 00:53:12,353
Well, I think it's going
to be a huge success.

788
00:53:12,354 --> 00:53:16,024
Everyone loves to read about
the dark side of New York.

789
00:53:16,025 --> 00:53:18,444
Oh, so it's that kind of book, is it?

790
00:53:19,445 --> 00:53:22,322
Well, I just might have to read it then.

791
00:53:22,323 --> 00:53:24,616
Why read, when I can
show you the real thing?

792
00:53:25,534 --> 00:53:28,411
Are you offering to be our guide?

793
00:53:28,412 --> 00:53:29,412
Our guide?

794
00:53:29,413 --> 00:53:32,416
Yes, my husband is coming to
pick me up in a few minutes.

795
00:53:51,852 --> 00:53:53,812
Rolf, don't think you've
had enough to drink?

796
00:53:53,979 --> 00:53:55,647
No, I'm fine thank you.

797
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,733
I'm sorry I missed your
book launching my friend,

798
00:53:58,734 --> 00:54:01,987
but, you know, in my world
business always comes first.

799
00:54:02,363 --> 00:54:03,280
Well.

800
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:05,740
Business always comes first?

801
00:54:05,741 --> 00:54:09,119
First after you, mein Schatz.

802
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,080
You're a wise man, Rolf.

803
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,831
Yeah, let's have a toast,

804
00:54:13,832 --> 00:54:16,626
to whatever the night may bring.

805
00:54:16,627 --> 00:54:18,003
Yes, indeed.

806
00:54:38,607 --> 00:54:40,150
Dorian!

807
00:54:51,245 --> 00:54:52,245
Dorian!

808
00:55:06,677 --> 00:55:07,678
Dorian?

809
00:55:22,943 --> 00:55:25,320
Dorian!

810
00:55:31,201 --> 00:55:32,785
- Hello.
- Henry.

811
00:55:32,786 --> 00:55:34,413
Oh, and where have you been?

812
00:55:35,372 --> 00:55:37,040
I'm taking a vacation.

813
00:55:37,666 --> 00:55:38,749
What are you talking about?

814
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,877
You've got a screen
test at Fox next week.

815
00:55:40,878 --> 00:55:43,045
Not to mention the LA
launch of the book.

816
00:55:43,046 --> 00:55:45,298
You haven't got time
for a goddamn vacation.

817
00:55:45,299 --> 00:55:47,175
Yes, well I need a vacation,

818
00:55:47,176 --> 00:55:49,469
so I'm taking one, understand?

819
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:52,514
I see, so where are you going?

820
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:54,391
Germany.

821
00:55:55,225 --> 00:55:56,727
Germany, well why not?

822
00:55:57,352 --> 00:55:58,936
Oh, I see, so you're going

823
00:55:58,937 --> 00:56:00,897
with that Eurotrash bimbo

824
00:56:00,898 --> 00:56:03,107
and her billionaire
impotent husband, are you?

825
00:56:03,108 --> 00:56:06,028
Look here Dorian, we have a contract.

826
00:56:06,945 --> 00:56:08,614
Body and soul, Henry?

827
00:56:10,199 --> 00:56:12,159
Body and soul, Dorian.

828
00:56:19,374 --> 00:56:21,376
So he just walked out on you?

829
00:56:22,461 --> 00:56:23,461
Yes.

830
00:56:23,462 --> 00:56:27,173
But you were still handling
his dough, the book, modeling?

831
00:56:27,174 --> 00:56:30,092
Well, I still had
power of attorney, yes.

832
00:56:30,093 --> 00:56:31,011
He didn't need any money.

833
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,512
He was living in a huge mansion

834
00:56:32,513 --> 00:56:33,931
in the Bavaria for God's sake.

835
00:56:35,432 --> 00:56:38,185
I even heard that he
tried photography again,

836
00:56:39,436 --> 00:56:43,272
but without my influence,
that got nowhere fast.

837
00:56:43,273 --> 00:56:45,483
He reverted back to being the toy boy

838
00:56:45,484 --> 00:56:46,735
he was always meant to be.

839
00:56:55,661 --> 00:56:58,746
That's how Dorian spent
the next few years.

840
00:56:58,747 --> 00:57:01,832
He lived like kept
man, a two bit gigolo.

841
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:03,918
And made out like a bandit.

842
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:06,170
He should've realized there was a catch.

843
00:57:06,171 --> 00:57:10,175
He wasn't really in the
driver's seat, Rolf was.

844
00:57:11,843 --> 00:57:13,386
Mariel la love, my sweet.

845
00:57:13,387 --> 00:57:14,929
I wanted to talk with you privately

846
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:16,557
before our guest joins us.

847
00:57:17,641 --> 00:57:19,643
Very well Rolf, about what?

848
00:57:20,602 --> 00:57:21,728
You know,

849
00:57:22,646 --> 00:57:26,108
sometimes what you want and
what I need are not the same.

850
00:57:27,276 --> 00:57:29,360
And I think that our dear friend Dorian

851
00:57:29,361 --> 00:57:31,113
has fallen into that category.

852
00:57:32,406 --> 00:57:33,407
What do you mean?

853
00:57:37,369 --> 00:57:39,538
I put a sleeping pill in his drink.

854
00:57:41,123 --> 00:57:42,583
He'll be sleeping for hours.

855
00:57:44,334 --> 00:57:46,837
Mm, absolutely beautiful.

856
00:57:50,173 --> 00:57:51,174
Gracias.

857
00:57:55,137 --> 00:57:56,887
You know that I'm always happy

858
00:57:56,888 --> 00:57:59,224
to give you whatever your heart desires.

859
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,267
Yes.

860
00:58:01,268 --> 00:58:04,895
But to put it delicately, I feel

861
00:58:04,896 --> 00:58:06,982
that Dorian has overstayed his welcome.

862
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:11,027
Are you saying you want him to leave?

863
00:58:11,028 --> 00:58:12,112
I'm afraid so.

864
00:58:14,114 --> 00:58:16,574
- Dorian.
- Yes.

865
00:58:16,575 --> 00:58:17,909
Fly away with us.

866
00:58:20,537 --> 00:58:22,246
It's time for us to say

867
00:58:22,247 --> 00:58:23,582
'Auf wiedersehen' to Dorian.

868
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:26,585
I don't know if it's such a good idea.

869
00:58:27,878 --> 00:58:29,462
When are you leaving?

870
00:58:29,463 --> 00:58:30,464
Another week.

871
00:58:31,256 --> 00:58:34,593
Hmm, a nice sophisticated,
Euro triangle.

872
00:58:35,594 --> 00:58:36,762
Sounds cozy.

873
00:58:40,557 --> 00:58:42,767
Rolf, please don't.

874
00:58:42,768 --> 00:58:44,143
Please don't?

875
00:58:44,144 --> 00:58:46,312
I know the two of you
have gotten rather close.

876
00:58:46,313 --> 00:58:47,439
But it's not-

877
00:58:49,691 --> 00:58:50,692
No buts.

878
00:58:56,031 --> 00:58:57,115
Rolf likes you.

879
00:58:58,116 --> 00:58:59,785
Oh, and I like him great.

880
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:06,083
He's my husband and I
love him, but I want you.

881
00:59:12,339 --> 00:59:15,467
Do I detect a schoolgirl
crush on Dorian?

882
00:59:16,551 --> 00:59:19,762
Grow up,
he's not worthy of our attention.

883
00:59:19,763 --> 00:59:21,222
He's so common.

884
00:59:21,223 --> 00:59:22,683
He is our friend.

885
00:59:25,602 --> 00:59:27,979
I got contracts, Mariel la,

886
00:59:28,855 --> 00:59:30,107
obligations.

887
00:59:33,443 --> 00:59:34,611
I know.

888
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:39,448
I am your husband,
and I want him to leave.

889
00:59:39,449 --> 00:59:40,450
Mariel la.

890
00:59:46,998 --> 00:59:47,999
But he-

891
00:59:49,292 --> 00:59:52,129
Don't ever contradict
me, you understand?

892
00:59:57,259 --> 00:59:58,260
Yes.

893
00:59:59,177 --> 01:00:01,179
Now compose yourself
before he arrives.

894
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:03,180
Let me show you something

895
01:00:03,181 --> 01:00:05,100
I'm sure you'll find interesting.

896
01:00:36,173 --> 01:00:37,716
Dorian, come in.

897
01:00:42,053 --> 01:00:43,096
Sit down.

898
01:00:48,477 --> 01:00:49,728
Enjoy the show.

899
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,817
How about some sound?

900
01:00:57,778 --> 01:00:58,779
Rolf.

901
01:00:59,863 --> 01:01:00,864
Turn it off.

902
01:01:01,782 --> 01:01:03,074
I said turn it off!

903
01:01:06,411 --> 01:01:08,537
Impotent son of a-

904
01:01:08,538 --> 01:01:10,414
You don't deserve her.

905
01:01:10,415 --> 01:01:12,374
I'm taking her with me.

906
01:01:12,375 --> 01:01:14,836
You really think so, you fool.

907
01:01:15,462 --> 01:01:17,506
You really think she'll
leave all this for you?

908
01:01:18,507 --> 01:01:21,342
Take a look at her face,
tell me if I'm wrong.

909
01:01:21,343 --> 01:01:22,344
Look at her!

910
01:01:27,933 --> 01:01:31,269
I wish for once, you will
stop deciding things for me.

911
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,025
- Oh my!
- After all I've done for you.

912
01:01:38,026 --> 01:01:40,110
This is how you'll repay me?

913
01:01:40,111 --> 01:01:41,947
Please, please!

914
01:01:42,989 --> 01:01:43,990
Please.

915
01:01:44,741 --> 01:01:46,158
Whoa!

916
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:47,077
Stop!

917
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,078
Stop it!

918
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,621
This is crazy, stop it, please!

919
01:01:50,622 --> 01:01:51,331
Stop!

920
01:01:51,331 --> 01:01:52,290
No!

921
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,707
Stop it!

922
01:01:53,708 --> 01:01:55,835
This is crazy, stop!

923
01:01:55,836 --> 01:01:57,003
Please, please!

924
01:01:59,714 --> 01:02:00,841
Oh!

925
01:02:01,132 --> 01:02:02,133
No!

926
01:02:02,843 --> 01:02:04,302
No, no!

927
01:02:11,935 --> 01:02:13,270
You okay?

928
01:02:16,231 --> 01:02:17,440
Henry!

929
01:02:31,413 --> 01:02:33,832
Dorian, Dorian!

930
01:02:41,923 --> 01:02:44,550
Dorian, what are we going to do?

931
01:02:44,551 --> 01:02:45,552
Rolf is-

932
01:02:48,346 --> 01:02:49,597
What, what?

933
01:02:49,598 --> 01:02:51,223
Get out, get out!

934
01:02:51,224 --> 01:02:52,434
What is this?

935
01:02:54,185 --> 01:02:59,231
Oh my God, it's blood, the
picture is bleeding, Dorian.

936
01:02:59,232 --> 01:03:00,316
It's Rolf's blood.

937
01:03:00,317 --> 01:03:01,151
What?

938
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,360
The picture is bleeding Rolf's blood.

939
01:03:03,361 --> 01:03:06,156
What, Dorian, Dorian!

940
01:03:06,448 --> 01:03:07,489
Listen to me.

941
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:09,618
Who is it in this picture?

942
01:03:11,328 --> 01:03:12,328
Who is it?

943
01:03:15,498 --> 01:03:16,499
It's me.

944
01:03:20,462 --> 01:03:21,838
Me in the picture.

945
01:03:23,465 --> 01:03:25,800
No, no.

946
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:28,261
No, oh no!

947
01:03:29,721 --> 01:03:30,931
Mariel la!

948
01:03:32,098 --> 01:03:33,515
No!

949
01:03:33,516 --> 01:03:35,100
Mariel la!

950
01:03:35,101 --> 01:03:37,771
- No!
- Mariel la, Mariel la!

951
01:03:38,438 --> 01:03:41,274
Mariel la, Mariel la, no!

952
01:04:47,215 --> 01:04:51,844
He didn't even wait for
the funerals, just took off.

953
01:04:51,845 --> 01:04:55,514
That was about 10 years ago.

954
01:04:55,515 --> 01:04:57,641
Do you ever hear from him?

955
01:04:57,642 --> 01:04:58,643
No.

956
01:05:00,562 --> 01:05:02,605
What about Bae, Ms. Conick?

957
01:05:03,606 --> 01:05:04,606
I don't think so.

958
01:05:04,607 --> 01:05:06,317
She would've told me if she had.

959
01:05:07,235 --> 01:05:09,319
Of course, there were rumors.

960
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,155
Someone would run into him

961
01:05:11,156 --> 01:05:13,450
at some flesh pot
somewhere on the planet.

962
01:05:14,409 --> 01:05:17,327
Some dive where they sell
any kind of pleasure.

963
01:05:17,328 --> 01:05:20,498
You know, boys, girls,
whatever they like.

964
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:23,293
Pretty sordid stuff.

965
01:05:26,963 --> 01:05:28,839
From what I could gather,

966
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,050
Dorian was caught in a mad race that

967
01:05:31,051 --> 01:05:33,970
took him spiraling into
the depths of hell.

968
01:05:35,764 --> 01:05:38,807
Eventually landed in the midst
of a perverted sex scandal

969
01:05:38,808 --> 01:05:42,645
in Bangkok, but charges
where never laid against him.

970
01:05:43,646 --> 01:05:46,732
I then heard that he
left Thailand soon after,

971
01:05:46,733 --> 01:05:48,609
to continue his depraved ways

972
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:50,779
in other remote parts of the world.

973
01:06:00,288 --> 01:06:01,706
And then about a week ago,

974
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:05,501
Bae had a big retrospective in Tribeca.

975
01:06:05,502 --> 01:06:09,130
So I hosted a party for her at my house.

976
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:20,808
Bae darling, I loved it.

977
01:06:20,809 --> 01:06:22,101
It was just fabulous.

978
01:06:22,102 --> 01:06:22,936
Thank you, Diana.

979
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,436
And you're taking it on the road?

980
01:06:24,437 --> 01:06:27,397
Yes, LA, Chicago, Dallas
and maybe even Paris

981
01:06:27,398 --> 01:06:29,399
- and London in the fall.
- Oh.

982
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,027
Oh my God, look.

983
01:06:34,614 --> 01:06:36,073
Dorian.

984
01:06:36,074 --> 01:06:38,742
Hello, Bae, Trina, Diana.

985
01:06:38,743 --> 01:06:39,993
I don't believe it.

986
01:06:39,994 --> 01:06:41,954
Dorian, look at you?

987
01:06:41,955 --> 01:06:43,705
Dammit, he's still gorgeous.

988
01:06:43,706 --> 01:06:45,124
Dorian, I'm gonna Kill you,

989
01:06:45,125 --> 01:06:47,084
you haven't aged a bit in 20 years.

990
01:06:47,085 --> 01:06:49,003
Who'd you go to, that Brazilian doctor?

991
01:06:51,047 --> 01:06:55,426
Good Lord, look
what the cat dragged in.

992
01:07:00,598 --> 01:07:01,932
Hello Dorian.

993
01:07:01,933 --> 01:07:02,976
Hello Henry.

994
01:07:03,935 --> 01:07:05,310
It's good to see you.

995
01:07:05,311 --> 01:07:06,271
And you.

996
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:09,064
Honestly Dorian, look at yourself!

997
01:07:09,065 --> 01:07:12,151
How do you look so good?

998
01:07:12,152 --> 01:07:13,611
Genetics, I guess.

999
01:07:15,405 --> 01:07:17,114
Look, I'm going for a drink later on,

1000
01:07:17,115 --> 01:07:18,365
would you care to join me?

1001
01:07:18,366 --> 01:07:21,285
No, I can't, I just
dropped by to say hi.

1002
01:07:21,286 --> 01:07:22,286
Glad you turned up.

1003
01:07:23,163 --> 01:07:23,913
Well, where are you staying?

1004
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:26,666
In the loft, just got
the place all cleaned up.

1005
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:29,001
Henry, we have to get going.

1006
01:07:29,002 --> 01:07:31,963
Mm, oh, some things never change.

1007
01:07:32,881 --> 01:07:35,716
Well, I'm going to drive Trina home,

1008
01:07:35,717 --> 01:07:37,551
so will you be here when I get back?

1009
01:07:37,552 --> 01:07:38,803
No, but I will call.

1010
01:07:42,223 --> 01:07:43,850
We have to talk, Dorian.

1011
01:07:49,522 --> 01:07:50,689
Henry, would you mind dropping me off

1012
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:53,025
along the way, I need my beauty sleep.

1013
01:07:53,026 --> 01:07:55,402
Of course not, Diana, oh Bae tomorrow.

1014
01:07:55,403 --> 01:07:56,945
Yes, goodbye.

1015
01:07:56,946 --> 01:07:57,946
Bye-bye!

1016
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,658
Great to see you, Dorian.

1017
01:08:01,659 --> 01:08:02,911
You're looking great, hm.

1018
01:08:13,421 --> 01:08:18,342
You must have a lot of
these from the old days, huh?

1019
01:08:18,343 --> 01:08:20,136
Every shot I ever took of you.

1020
01:08:21,262 --> 01:08:23,013
I'd like to borrow your proofs.

1021
01:08:23,014 --> 01:08:23,890
Which ones?

1022
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:26,850
All of them, just for a little while,

1023
01:08:26,851 --> 01:08:27,936
it's really important.

1024
01:08:29,437 --> 01:08:31,731
Well okay, are you all right?

1025
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:36,693
Yeah, yeah, it's
just, it's kind of weird

1026
01:08:36,694 --> 01:08:38,655
being back after all these years.

1027
01:08:39,572 --> 01:08:41,115
What are you going to do with them?

1028
01:08:45,078 --> 01:08:48,664
I'll tell you what, I'll
show you when I'm done.

1029
01:08:48,665 --> 01:08:50,624
So I can drop by tomorrow
and pick those up?

1030
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:52,877
Of course, call me, same old number.

1031
01:08:53,753 --> 01:08:54,796
I remember.

1032
01:09:02,804 --> 01:09:05,138
Spread, excellent.

1033
01:09:05,139 --> 01:09:06,140
Here.

1034
01:09:07,183 --> 01:09:09,810
Excuse me, aren't you Dorian?

1035
01:09:09,811 --> 01:09:11,520
No, no pictures, no pictures.

1036
01:09:11,521 --> 01:09:13,689
Hey Louis, you don't remember me?

1037
01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:16,651
James, I used to live next
door to you and Sybil?

1038
01:09:19,862 --> 01:09:22,489
You, you're the guy who Killed her!

1039
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:23,366
Hey!

1040
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:24,616
You're the guy who put
the needle in her arm!

1041
01:09:24,617 --> 01:09:25,867
I couldn't say no to her, man.

1042
01:09:25,868 --> 01:09:27,828
She was hurting too much and
after that guy came to see her.

1043
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:28,705
What guy?

1044
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,372
- The gray haired guy.
- Who Henry, Henry?

1045
01:09:30,373 --> 01:09:32,165
Yeah, was freaked out, man.

1046
01:09:32,166 --> 01:09:34,877
She came to me for help, and
he paid for her drugs, man.

1047
01:09:42,051 --> 01:09:43,594
It's all right, it's all right.

1048
01:10:13,541 --> 01:10:16,586
I can believe anything.

1049
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,550
Get out, get out!

1050
01:10:34,437 --> 01:10:36,188
There are no limits,

1051
01:10:36,189 --> 01:10:39,484
with that sweet smile, the boyish grin.

1052
01:10:40,276 --> 01:10:42,862
Forever Dorian, forever.

1053
01:10:44,322 --> 01:10:45,322
You'll go all the way.

1054
01:10:45,323 --> 01:10:46,865
We could rule this business.

1055
01:10:46,866 --> 01:10:48,785
What do you do?

1056
01:10:48,951 --> 01:10:51,370
You want to play?

1057
01:10:51,371 --> 01:10:53,330
No, no!

1058
01:10:53,331 --> 01:10:54,374
Get down!

1059
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:56,876
Yes, yes!

1060
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:00,755
No!

1061
01:11:03,257 --> 01:11:04,925
Go on, forget your photography!

1062
01:11:04,926 --> 01:11:06,760
Forget your dreams,
just throw it all away

1063
01:11:06,761 --> 01:11:08,346
and go uptown to your jerk off party.

1064
01:11:18,398 --> 01:11:22,110
Look here Dorian,
we had a contract.

1065
01:11:48,428 --> 01:11:50,345
Dorian came to Bae's studio

1066
01:11:50,346 --> 01:11:53,932
and took away all the photographs
that she'd taken of him.

1067
01:11:53,933 --> 01:11:57,769
Then on New Year's Eve,
Bae had a premonition

1068
01:11:57,770 --> 01:11:59,522
and she insisted that I call him.

1069
01:12:00,815 --> 01:12:01,816
Nothing.

1070
01:12:03,943 --> 01:12:04,943
Good luck.

1071
01:12:57,914 --> 01:12:58,956
Dorian?

1072
01:13:08,007 --> 01:13:09,008
Dorian?

1073
01:13:22,522 --> 01:13:23,606
Dorian?

1074
01:13:25,274 --> 01:13:26,317
Hello, Bae.

1075
01:13:31,531 --> 01:13:32,406
Dorian, what-

1076
01:13:32,407 --> 01:13:35,993
I've been working for
days, then I crashed.

1077
01:13:40,206 --> 01:13:41,624
Why is it so hot in here?

1078
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:43,584
I love the desert.

1079
01:13:45,419 --> 01:13:48,256
Have you ever seen two
scorpions fight to the death?

1080
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:51,551
It's beautiful.

1081
01:13:57,223 --> 01:13:58,808
Let's get some light into here.

1082
01:14:01,477 --> 01:14:03,603
No, I like it dark!

1083
01:14:03,604 --> 01:14:06,816
No, no, you're hurting me!

1084
01:14:07,942 --> 01:14:08,985
Ow!

1085
01:14:10,069 --> 01:14:11,237
What's wrong with you?

1086
01:14:15,324 --> 01:14:16,325
Dorian.

1087
01:14:20,246 --> 01:14:21,247
My pictures.

1088
01:14:22,707 --> 01:14:24,792
Yeah, I've got some shit to work out.

1089
01:14:28,838 --> 01:14:30,840
Don't like what I did with your shots?

1090
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:38,764
I've got you!

1091
01:14:40,349 --> 01:14:41,683
What have I done to you?

1092
01:14:41,684 --> 01:14:43,351
Remember this, recognize
your great work of art?

1093
01:14:43,352 --> 01:14:45,353
No, that's not mine, Henry shot it.

1094
01:14:45,354 --> 01:14:46,355
Henry!

1095
01:14:47,898 --> 01:14:49,316
I tried to warn you.

1096
01:14:49,317 --> 01:14:50,358
Warn me, about what?

1097
01:14:50,359 --> 01:14:52,152
Henry, you knew.

1098
01:14:52,153 --> 01:14:55,906
Ow, you're not the first
caught in Henry's trap.

1099
01:14:56,073 --> 01:14:58,074
He's been hunting forever.

1100
01:14:58,075 --> 01:14:59,242
You promised me, Bae.

1101
01:14:59,243 --> 01:14:59,952
Ow!

1102
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:01,662
What did you trade your soul for, huh?

1103
01:15:01,829 --> 01:15:03,413
I did it for my art.

1104
01:15:03,414 --> 01:15:04,415
Your art?

1105
01:15:07,418 --> 01:15:08,419
Was it worth it?

1106
01:15:13,257 --> 01:15:15,925
Why Bae?

1107
01:15:15,926 --> 01:15:16,927
Why?

1108
01:15:18,012 --> 01:15:21,474
Dorian, I'm so sorry.

1109
01:15:31,233 --> 01:15:33,276
I have to set you free.

1110
01:15:33,277 --> 01:15:34,277
No!

1111
01:15:34,278 --> 01:15:35,862
I have to do this!

1112
01:15:35,863 --> 01:15:37,072
It's between Henry and I.

1113
01:15:37,073 --> 01:15:38,741
I have to go!

1114
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:46,874
Come on Bae.

1115
01:15:50,169 --> 01:15:51,420
Damn.

1116
01:16:22,993 --> 01:16:25,286
Ah, there is someone home.

1117
01:16:25,287 --> 01:16:26,747
Ah.

1118
01:16:29,959 --> 01:16:32,001
I thought you had a key to this place.

1119
01:16:32,002 --> 01:16:33,003
Where's Bae?

1120
01:16:33,796 --> 01:16:34,797
Drink?

1121
01:16:37,883 --> 01:16:41,886
I lent Bae my key,
she wants to see you.

1122
01:16:41,887 --> 01:16:44,473
Of course, naturally, you
weren't answering your phone.

1123
01:16:56,235 --> 01:16:57,445
What's that smell?

1124
01:16:59,613 --> 01:17:02,324
Oh, just a little eating in.

1125
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:06,537
So you went to see Sybil,

1126
01:17:08,706 --> 01:17:11,834
the night she died, didn't you?

1127
01:17:14,962 --> 01:17:16,839
Did I, huh?

1128
01:17:17,339 --> 01:17:19,841
Did Bae come over here?

1129
01:17:19,842 --> 01:17:20,843
Yeah,

1130
01:17:21,761 --> 01:17:23,012
you want that drink?

1131
01:17:24,013 --> 01:17:25,347
Well, where is she now?

1132
01:17:26,307 --> 01:17:28,350
She's over there.

1133
01:17:43,866 --> 01:17:44,867
Bae?

1134
01:17:55,419 --> 01:17:58,380
Death is the only thing that
ever terrifies me, I hate it.

1135
01:17:59,590 --> 01:18:01,383
She tried to cut my picture.

1136
01:18:07,181 --> 01:18:08,182
Poor Dorian.

1137
01:18:13,103 --> 01:18:14,688
It's a good thing you stopped her.

1138
01:18:15,648 --> 01:18:18,484
When that picture dies, so do you.

1139
01:18:24,824 --> 01:18:28,828
What are you gonna do,
Henry, call the police?

1140
01:18:29,662 --> 01:18:32,330
The police, good Lord
no, of course not, no.

1141
01:18:32,331 --> 01:18:35,500
No, actually, I was looking
for that drink you offered me.

1142
01:18:35,501 --> 01:18:37,919
We can toast our future together,

1143
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,590
because this goes on forever, remember?

1144
01:18:46,804 --> 01:18:49,473
How does that quotation go?

1145
01:18:51,642 --> 01:18:54,102
What does it profit a man,

1146
01:18:54,103 --> 01:18:58,064
if to gain the whole world and lose his-

1147
01:18:58,065 --> 01:18:59,066
Soul.

1148
01:19:03,946 --> 01:19:04,989
Soul.

1149
01:19:09,159 --> 01:19:10,369
Oh Dorian.

1150
01:19:11,579 --> 01:19:13,622
How lucky you are.

1151
01:19:14,999 --> 01:19:17,959
What an exquisite life you've had.

1152
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,919
You've drunk deeply of everything.

1153
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,964
Nothing has ever been hidden from you.

1154
01:19:24,049 --> 01:19:25,133
And it's all being no more

1155
01:19:25,134 --> 01:19:27,011
than the sound of music to you.

1156
01:19:29,054 --> 01:19:32,557
But it hasn't marred you,
you're still just the same.

1157
01:19:32,558 --> 01:19:35,728
No, I am not the same, Henry.

1158
01:19:37,479 --> 01:19:38,522
Yes.

1159
01:19:39,732 --> 01:19:42,775
Yes, you are.

1160
01:19:42,776 --> 01:19:44,194
You are perfect.

1161
01:19:45,946 --> 01:19:46,946
Flawless.

1162
01:19:48,949 --> 01:19:51,452
I wish I could change places with you.

1163
01:19:54,622 --> 01:19:57,582
The world cried out against us both.

1164
01:19:57,583 --> 01:19:59,877
But it has always worshiped you.

1165
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,840
I'm so glad that you
haven't had any talent.

1166
01:20:05,841 --> 01:20:08,843
You never carved a statue
or painted or picture

1167
01:20:08,844 --> 01:20:11,931
or produced anything outside yourself.

1168
01:20:15,184 --> 01:20:17,019
Your life has been your art.

1169
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:20,147
Your days are your sonnets.

1170
01:20:46,465 --> 01:20:47,466
No!

1171
01:20:49,301 --> 01:20:50,468
No!

1172
01:20:50,469 --> 01:20:52,220
Dorian, stop
it, Dorian, stop it!

1173
01:20:52,221 --> 01:20:53,055
Give it to me, Henry!

1174
01:20:53,055 --> 01:20:53,889
Stop it, no!

1175
01:20:53,889 --> 01:20:54,723
Henry, it's over!

1176
01:20:54,724 --> 01:20:56,058
Don't be a fool, no!

1177
01:20:58,102 --> 01:20:59,103
Dorian!

1178
01:21:00,354 --> 01:21:02,022
Henry!

1179
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:06,234
Dorian!

1180
01:21:06,235 --> 01:21:07,945
No!

1181
01:22:03,584 --> 01:22:05,543
Yes, can you send an ambulance

1182
01:22:05,544 --> 01:22:08,380
to 122 Spring, top floor loft.

1183
01:22:09,798 --> 01:22:11,925
Yes, yes it's an emergency.

1184
01:22:18,057 --> 01:22:19,058
Mr. Wooten.

1185
01:22:22,895 --> 01:22:23,896
Mr. Wooten.

1186
01:22:25,564 --> 01:22:26,981
Where's the picture?

1187
01:22:26,982 --> 01:22:29,318
- Do you want to see it?
- Yeah.

1188
01:22:59,223 --> 01:23:00,682
Son of a bitch.

1189
01:23:04,186 --> 01:23:05,813
I think we're gonna
wrap this up for now.

1190
01:23:12,111 --> 01:23:14,738
I may have some questions later.

1191
01:23:16,949 --> 01:23:18,866
Would you like a lift home?

1192
01:23:18,867 --> 01:23:20,660
Thanks, I'll take a cab.

1193
01:23:20,661 --> 01:23:21,661
All right.

1194
01:23:27,167 --> 01:23:28,168
Mr. Wooten.

1195
01:23:31,547 --> 01:23:32,756
Happy New Year.

1196
01:23:43,517 --> 01:23:44,977
Happy New Year.

1197
01:24:18,093 --> 01:24:19,219
Taxi!

1198
01:24:32,941 --> 01:24:35,067
- Hey.

1199
01:24:35,068 --> 01:24:37,528
Deliver this to 354 East 83rd.

1200
01:24:37,529 --> 01:24:38,989
Yeah, right.

1201
01:24:41,825 --> 01:24:45,745
Here, give it to the door
man, keep the change, huh?

1202
01:24:45,746 --> 01:24:48,332
You got it, pal.
