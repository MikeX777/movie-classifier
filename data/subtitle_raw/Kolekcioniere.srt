1
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,958
Well done. Prolong it.

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,949
Very well. And now we'll moo likea cow.

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,912
Great. And once again.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,959
Only stronger as if you were abig,
hoarse cow.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,955
Excellent.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,949
Now say it in a simple manner,
mind breathing and rhythm.

7
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,953
Hi, it's me.
Hi, it's me.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,958
Say it very cheerfully: Hi, it's me.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,910
Hi, it's me.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,436
And what if more cheerfully.
Hi, it's me.

11
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,956
OK, and now be angry,
you can even frown.

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,918
Hi, it's me.
Hi, it's me.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,958
That was great. But make it angrier.

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,951
You'rea wicked old man.

15
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,951
Hi, it's me.
Hi, it's me.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,910
That was brilliant.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,959
And now say it sadly: Hi, it's me.
Hi, it's me.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,956
Hi, it's me.
Hi, it's me.

19
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,951
Good boy.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,436
You're doing very well.
Did you practice at home?

21
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,910
Of course, you didn't.
Anyway, you weregreat.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,436
As always, you deserve aprize -

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,950
these are speech-improving waffles.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,949
Now I'll turn on the tape recorder
and you're gonna tell me

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,952
what you did at school today.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,956
Hey, what's up?

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,913
We'vealready recorded your voice once.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,959
Don't you want to do it again?
It's not scary at all.

29
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,952
Mind breathing - breath in and breath out.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,958
Well, tell me what did you do there.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,956
Alone?

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,958
What happened?
What's this rush for?

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,959
You never call for no reason.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,958
You date a woman or what?

35
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,951
Are you coming in?

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,950
Cool. I forgot you had this film.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,958
Who's that - me or Lina?

38
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,952
It's you.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,958
Do you remember
when we used to play cards?

40
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,916
You'd always say:

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,913
If you win, you can do whatever you want,

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,959
but if you lose, I'm the boss.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,912
And then you'd always laugh

44
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,958
and say the cards were written all over my face.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,959
I have some brandy,
wine is on the table.

46
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,952
Wanna drink?
No.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,958
You need some refurbishment.

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,958
You live here like atramp.

49
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,918
It's good for me as it is.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,959
When the flat is yours,
do whatever you want.

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,958
OK, what's up?

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,436
Gambled away again?

53
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,956
Need money? How much?

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,949
I just wanted to see my daughter.
Happens rarely.

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,912
It's you who never call.

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,950
Living like this, dad, you will...
Stop being grumpy.

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,956
I have cancer.

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,912
How much do you need?

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,959
Thetest results are on thetable.

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,915
I've decided not to wait till the end.

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,951
Pills, hospitals,
they're not for me, you know.

62
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,949
What do mean
you're not waiting till the end?

63
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,951
I wanna see if the fortune
is still by my side.

64
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,909
Let's play?
Come on, let's do it.

65
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,959
Dad, what are you talking about?
Let's play.

66
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,918
Dad, how can you say this?

67
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,912
Don't give up. You have to fight.

68
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,958
With these odds
I wouldn't even start a game.

69
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,952
But it's possible to curethe cancer.

70
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,918
Don't even dare to think about that.

71
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,958
Coward. You wimped out.
OK, then go, go away.

72
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,951
Don't talk to melikethat.

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,912
I know the professor.

74
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,958
He'll do everything I ask. I'll pay him.

75
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,952
You've always been gutless.
Go away.

76
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,959
Don't forget to say goodbye to Lina.

77
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,949
OK, you won. Let's play.

78
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,949
The Collectress

79
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,911
Are you fucking blind?

80
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,911
I'm very sorry.
Fuck you sorry.

81
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,433
Where did you buy your driving license?

82
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,959
Are you going to work?

83
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,917
To work what?
Stop asking all this bullshit.

84
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,959
It's eight to nine now.
Tell your price and go away.

85
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,953
So wake up ifit's eight to nine.
You crashed my bumper.

86
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,953
They are fucking expensive.
So are we calling cops or what?

87
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,473
Hundred is enough?

88
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,913
Two fifty.
No.

89
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,959
Fuck you. Wait till I see you again.

90
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,959
Hi. How do you like my new wheels?

91
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,911
They suit you.

92
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,958
Hello to you too, yes,
I'm fine, thejourney was great.

93
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,952
No time for that.
I'm in a rush, the patients arewaiting.

94
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,434
Raminta told me there were

95
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,949
three complaints against you from parents.

96
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,474
We can't afford that, what's up?

97
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,949
My father died.
Jesus, I'm sorry.

98
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,912
Take a holiday or something.

99
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,433
The clinic is small,

100
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,959
if rumours start going, we'll be ruined.

101
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,952
I understand, I'm OK.
Who let the dog in? No animals here.

102
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,917
It's me. It's OK.

103
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,913
We'll arrange the photo session,
make some posters. Hi.

104
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,912
By the way, I got the video editor's number.

105
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,958
Should I make an appointment or?

106
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,952
Give it to me, I'll do it myself.
What's this for?

107
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,952
You asked me to make
a short film for conference.

108
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,917
So my sister and me shot a bit.

109
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,911
Have you written the text?

110
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,957
I should practice a bit beforethepresentation.

111
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,952
I've decided to make
my presentations myself.

112
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,917
This one's going to be the first.

113
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,958
Are you serious?
You were always stage frighten.

114
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,959
Good evening.
Two champagnes.

115
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,959
Did you see? Damn sexy.

116
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,912
What are you going to do
with the money?

117
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,958
Don't know yet.
Half of the flat is not so big money.

118
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,917
You're right.

119
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,912
I'll buy some clothes at least.

120
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,958
And you know,
I got Tom into a corner.

121
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,917
Already? You're fast.

122
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,913
Yes, there's nothing to wait for.

123
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,959
And then there is the dowry for the start.

124
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,913
You know the girls
are planning a hen-party.

125
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,437
They doubted if it wasn't not too soon,
you know... dad.

126
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,957
But I told them not to besilly.
So therewill bea party.

127
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,958
Remember to bring the camera on Saturday?
What?

128
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,912
I've told you more than once.

129
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,958
We bore your drunk face at our wedding.

130
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,918
But this is just too much.

131
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,956
What is it exactly you don't like?
I did my job.

132
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,919
Those pooing horses look disgusting.

133
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,959
But they do it in reality.
It's pure documentary.

134
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,958
While the oath is being made,
you show people yawning.

135
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,918
And then eating like fucking pigs.

136
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,911
Theseare your words not mine.

137
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,957
I filmed everything as it was.

138
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,953
You aregonna redo this video again.

139
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,911
Look, the danceis on slow motion.

140
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,912
We wanted it to be nice, romantic.

141
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,958
Look, that's romantic - out of focus.

142
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,912
You took shitload of money from us.

143
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,958
It's not a wedding, it's somekind ofparody.

144
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,952
As I've told you already,
I filmed everything as it was.

145
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,909
I see.
You're going to give my money back.

146
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,915
I'll get you, you drunkard.
It's not your fucking business.

147
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,434
If you are here for wedding video,

148
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,949
I suggest you going somewhere else.

149
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,953
Get the fuck out ofhere, you doggone ass.
Bounder.

150
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,959
It's seven already? Well, come in.

151
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,436
I'll finish up hereand then I'm all yours.

152
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,950
Got overloaded with weddings.

153
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,959
Come on, mouse,
do your fucking job.

154
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,959
Don't just stand it there,
it drives me fuckin' mad.

155
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,953
You could clean up abit
before suggesting a seat.

156
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,952
Listen, lady,
stop telling me how to live.

157
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,951
There was one already.

158
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,436
So what did you bring - school celebration,

159
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,950
Easter party? Or maybe funeral?

160
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,951
I told you I'm a speech therapist.

161
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,957
Oh right, speech therapist.

162
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,911
But why no funeral.

163
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,389
I'd make a great stuff out of it,

164
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,955
just imaginethewinged body out of the coffin.

165
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,917
Let's change the subject.

166
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,912
Ah, you'll never please the bitches.

167
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,911
There is always something wrong -

168
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,957
either bad editing or living in mess.

169
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,918
This bitch is going to pay you.

170
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,434
So better finish up your coffee

171
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,949
and let's get down to business.

172
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,916
OK. So what do you want?

173
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,915
Here's therecord of
five stammering children.

174
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,390
I apply different therapy methods with them.

175
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,956
It's teaching material for theseminar.

176
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,956
Nothing much to do,
just make it 10-12 minutes length.

177
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,955
Deadline?

178
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,958
Tomorrow half eight
the office girl will come to takeit.

179
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,919
Does the office girl
know what is beautiful?

180
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,389
It doesn't have to be beautiful.

181
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,955
Just the length and so that it has a sequence.

182
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,955
Great.

183
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,959
The door is open.
Goodbye.

184
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,913
And now wemove on to another presentation

185
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,959
"The old and the new ways to curethestammering"

186
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,429
by Gaile Grigalaviciute,

187
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,955
thespeech therapist of the private clinic.

188
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,952
We have film here.

189
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,912
Hello, dear colleagues.

190
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,389
I have some footage on the practical examples

191
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,955
how to apply thenew methods.

192
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,951
Whilewatching I'll make some comments.

193
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,957
Then your questions.

194
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,951
Turn off the light, please.

195
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,958
Hi, it's me.

196
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,956
Hi, it's me.

197
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,390
This is how they learn to intonate,

198
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,956
which later could be applied in everyday life.

199
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,912
Here's another exercise.

200
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,950
Stop faking off, read the text. Slower.

201
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:08,956
Read slower, listen to the rhythm. Slower.

202
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,958
But I am slow.

203
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,959
OK, that's enough. Now listen.

204
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,958
How do you like it?

205
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,917
Lt' OK.

206
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,915
It's not OK, you stutter.
No, my speaking is OK.

207
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,434
So you want to keep it like that.

208
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,949
You don't want to learn talk fluently.

209
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,951
But I do talk fluently.

210
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,956
OK, read once again.

211
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,910
Do it for me, please.

212
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,958
Gaile, don't you dare to leave.
I'm not prepared.

213
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,959
I'll keep you company.

214
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,958
Why so sad?

215
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,956
Why, why?

216
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,911
I'm OK.

217
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,949
You're silent all evening.
Come on, let's drink.

218
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,959
Let's go inside, it's starting.

219
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,949
Hey, you retard,
you could've told you lost your mind.

220
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,953
Gaile, listen to me.

221
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,958
Stop, you asshole,
and behave like a man.

222
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,952
You are quick to rook, yeah, you prick!

223
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,950
Damned macho fucker!
Quick to rook, yeah. Fucker.

224
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,958
OK, let's play the last one on the nod.

225
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,950
Some day.

226
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,913
Piss off, enough drinking for free.

227
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,959
Fuck it, don't leave me likethat, I'm broke.

228
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,951
So bugger off.

229
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,959
What a surprise.
Beer, schnapps or what?

230
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,953
I brought new footage.

231
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,949
You aresick or what, Missy?
Do you know what's the time?

232
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,958
I need you to edit me something.
You are great.

233
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,952
Yeah, right, just snap
your fingers and I'm on it.

234
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,912
Olichka, one more.

235
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,958
First, pay for what you've already drunk.

236
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,952
Put it on my account.
You don't have any.

237
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,917
Come on, Olichka.

238
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,959
Just mess around
with me and you're out of here.

239
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,951
Fucking hole.

240
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,959
"Una testis, nulatestis".
Do you know what it means?

241
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,958
Thank you, good job.

242
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,956
Enjoy.

243
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,915
Sorry for themethods
and for staying here.

244
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,949
Your cluckings are queer,
nothing like I'veseen before.

245
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,958
Coffee?
Yes, thank you.

246
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,949
Sorry for asking,
but what's the point with your filming?

247
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,950
Coming down on peopleat nighttime,
wasting your money.

248
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,912
Can't find something filthy on the net?

249
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,949
It's everything but that,
I need something different.

250
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,958
So I shouldn't worry
that you are some kind of pervert?

251
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,951
Can you hear?

252
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,958
Boys or girls?

253
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,952
The laughter.

254
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,958
Sorry, what does it
have to do with balls?

255
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,953
No, no.
I need laughter now.

256
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,911
Listen, I'll pay you.

257
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,959
OK, there's Shtirlitz going down thestreet...

258
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,918
I need you to film me.

259
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,950
No way, I won't mess
around with the camera.

260
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,955
Be quiet.

261
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,956
Clients?

262
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,912
Let's go.

263
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,949
It looks cheap.
Are you sure it's gonna to be funny?

264
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,955
Believe me,
it will be when you watch it.

265
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,912
Well, are you ready?
Wait a minute, I'll go first.

266
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,959
It's going to be kind of
rehearsal before sister's wedding.

267
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,910
Hi.

268
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,389
I brought it. Sorry, should've done it earlier.

269
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,955
Editing is done, if you want.

270
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:11,956
Of course, I want.
And how do you like it, honestly?

271
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,952
Why ask? You'll seeit.

272
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,959
When you think it over now,
it all turned out wacky.

273
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,953
I shouldn't have yelled at you
in front of everybody.

274
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,952
But you arenot angry
with me, are you?

275
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,918
Peace?
OK, peace.

276
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,950
That guy had it coming -
he got an accident at work.

277
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,918
So, let's go shopping.

278
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,959
I need to buy some
stuff before the wedding.

279
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,917
I can't park here.
I'll get it clamped.

280
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,958
Leave it in a car park.
I don't have much time.

281
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,953
Do you know at least
when my wedding is?

282
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,952
If I were you, I'd think it over.

283
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,912
I'm sorry, Saulius' mother has called;

284
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,958
they'rebeing late, but on their way now.

285
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,474
Today's session is canceled.

286
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,915
But they're on their way.

287
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,958
I'm telling you -
today's session is canceled.

288
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,951
The same with others.

289
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,958
OK, but if the boss asks?

290
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,917
I don't feel good.

291
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,959
Would you likea cup of tea?
No, thanks.

292
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,952
Hey, doggy, come here.

293
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,958
Leavethe dog for a minute.

294
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,958
How did you like it?

295
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,437
Curious way to win
over the employee.

296
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,957
I didn't expect you
to be so insightful.

297
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,912
Your car is awesome.

298
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,959
I hope it's not the end of our evening.

299
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,476
So huge, damn kicky fast.

300
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,711
I'd like to have a ride.

301
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,951
Nobody drives it but me.

302
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,951
Sure?
Yes.

303
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,956
Really?

304
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,956
So?

305
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,956
Cool.

306
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,959
Where are you going?

307
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,959
What are you doing?
Are going to take this snot?

308
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,953
Thereareno cars here,
wehave to take him.

309
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,949
Thanks a lot.
You can drop me off somewhere in the city.

310
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,390
Are you going from the pub?

311
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,956
The same as you, judging from the smell.

312
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,912
How's the car? Pimped up?

313
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,958
Believe me, it's gonna be enough for you.

314
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,959
Gaile, slow down.
Don't you like it?

315
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,956
Gaile, slow down.

316
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,956
Take it easy.

317
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,956
Look out.

318
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,959
What the fuck are you doing?

319
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,951
Gaile, stop the car.

320
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,956
I always wanted to run a red light.

321
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,912
Gaile, don't you dare.
Damnly expensive car.

322
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,959
Gaile, for fuck's sake,
stop the damn car, you bitch!

323
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,958
Get out of the car! Piss off, you two!

324
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,917
Get out you fucking avant-garde!

325
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,912
You are gonna make
your shitty films, ah?

326
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,959
You've filmed yourself enough,
just bugger off my car.

327
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,952
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

328
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,915
If you would've continued,
I'd have freaked out as well.

329
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,389
When you come to think about it,

330
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,955
I would've never done anything like that before.

331
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,952
Is it ringing in your bag?

332
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,911
The boss?

333
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,950
What happens when you
forget your sister's wedding?

334
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,958
Are wetaking this one?
Yes.

335
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,949
Only don't put it on theback seat.

336
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,958
Come to me.

337
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,436
Take the camera,
we have to film the dog.

338
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,956
Later, OK?
Let's finish it up herefirst.

339
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,953
No, do it now.
He'll run away.

340
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,959
Well, doggy, can you run fast?

341
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,949
I'm afraid you'll cry,
not laugh, watching this record.

342
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,949
Laughter is not enough.
You need different stuff.

343
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,952
Interesting.

344
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,915
I'm sorry,
may I borrow the dog for a minute?

345
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,958
Thereis a troublesome child,
he could play with it.

346
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,958
Wait... outside.

347
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,958
Come to me, come.

348
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,958
It was an accident.

349
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,952
We'll buy another one.

350
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,949
Nothing, not even a hand shook.

351
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,949
I haveto come close,
to kiss and just leave?

352
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,917
Are you sure you'll do it?

353
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,958
I don't believe it.
I thought you were gonna freak out.

354
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,955
Freak out? Why?

355
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,913
Fuck it. Damn hard snout.

356
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,959
How many times did I tell you,
you haveto be...

357
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,950
Oh, hi. You'd better come tomorrow.
The pipe got burst.

358
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,912
What about hardware? Computer?

359
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,959
Not much ofit here.
You know, just call in tomorrow.

360
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,951
I'll tidy up a bit.

361
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,952
Let me in.

362
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,959
So you say pipes.

363
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,390
Well. It's not abig deal,

364
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,956
we'll buy a new monitor, computer as well.

365
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,953
Listen, lady,
don't tell me what to do.

366
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,952
Mind your own business.

367
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,958
Get me some napkins.

368
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,958
Who did this to you?

369
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,912
Don't tell me it's your clients.

370
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,912
What's the difference?
Mind your own business.

371
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,911
What they're gonna do? Come back?

372
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,957
They do that anyway. I give a shit.

373
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,917
Nobody kills for that money.

374
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,956
If you get beaten, you can't work.

375
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,917
You say, nobody is going to kill?

376
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,959
I can pay your debts.
Then they leave you in peace.

377
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,956
In return you'll have to film me.

378
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:10,918
You and your stupid videos.

379
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,958
Did you gambleaway or went into business?

380
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,917
Never mind, it's just poker.

381
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,958
How much?
How much, how much... Twenty grants.

382
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,951
Litas?
Litas, litas.

383
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,958
So would you like to
work for me for twenty?

384
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,915
I won't give you the money.
I don't trust gamblers.

385
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,433
You'll take meto the creditor.

386
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,959
This is not gonna to happen, that's for sure.

387
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,918
We'll pick the camera.
It's going to be your first task.

388
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,389
Are you insane or what?

389
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,955
They won't let us mess around with the camera.

390
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,953
We'll hide it.
Where? In your bag?

391
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,436
Do you have the money?

392
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,956
She has.
Wait there.

393
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,949
So now you are carrying women's bags?
Pussy licker.

394
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,911
So we are going.

395
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,958
Wait aminute.
Do you think I'm an idiot, cannot count?

396
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,911
What do you mean?

397
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,958
You forgot the interest.
What interest?

398
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,918
I wanna play.

399
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,436
Stop joking. Giveus a week,
I'll give everything back.

400
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,956
What week?
Have you any idea what you're talking about?

401
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,956
With pleasure. Follow me.

402
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,949
I can only gamblewith money
we brought. That's all I have.

403
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,958
OK, let it be.

404
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,911
Thank you.

405
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,958
Can you play at least?

406
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,958
Three thousand.

407
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,958
Raise.

408
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,958
Check.

409
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,911
All in.

410
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,956
Gaile.
Take it easy.

411
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,956
Ifl win we're clear of debts.

412
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,473
Gaile.

413
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,959
Shut up.

414
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,912
Where did you learn to gamble?

415
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,958
It's one of the two things
I inherited from my father.

416
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,952
What's thesecond?

417
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,959
Nobody ever did anything like that to me.

418
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,953
Cool, they were fucked.
Did you see her face?

419
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,958
The debt is bullshit,
but thegamewas awesome.

420
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,956
Did you like it?
Of course, why ask.

421
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,917
You liked theway I played?

422
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,956
Come on, to bluff likethat.
You're genius.

423
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,918
How do you likeme as a woman?

424
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,912
Well, you sure are straightforward.

425
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,958
Do you really want to know?

426
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,956
Let's go.

427
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,910
Hello.

428
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,959
Double for a night.

429
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,956
Room number

430
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,949
Sign here, please.
Good night.

431
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,956
Come here.

432
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,958
You hide here.

433
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,958
When I'm back you start filming.

434
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,956
Hey, whereare you going?

435
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,950
Wait here.

436
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,959
You see, I already know
where to look for you.

437
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,953
Right. Here comes the porn star.

438
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,950
If you don't want me to be followed,
get a mobile.

439
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,958
I haven't edited yet.
Come back later.

440
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,956
It's disgusting.

441
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,958
One more.

442
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:05,949
Disgusting, you say?
Who is disgusting? Him or me?

443
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,959
Piss off. One more.

444
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,958
We made a deal.

445
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,959
Sorry, I just can't stand your face.

446
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,958
I hope you'll help me.

447
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,951
With what?

448
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,959
Filming your orgies?

449
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,956
I really need that.

450
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,913
Yes, you need help.

451
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,950
And if it wasn't for your money,
I'd be gone already.

452
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,949
OK, weare settled.
You're free to go.

453
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,956
Come on.

454
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,958
And now what?

455
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,956
Nothing.

456
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,916
The stone reaches the water
and drowns to the depths.

457
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,913
Silent and lonely.

458
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,959
And the river takes it all to the sea, or maybe...

459
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,959
So this is how you seduce women?

460
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,958
Stay here.

461
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,956
So?

462
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,958
Don't talk, just look.

463
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,959
Are you going to film me or what?

464
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,956
Gaile, give me your hand and go down.

465
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,918
Don't come closer, step back.

466
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,958
Film. And don't even think of rescuing me.

467
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:01,950
Gaile, stop it.
Film.

468
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:02,950
Film.

469
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:03,916
Film.

470
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,912
Haven't you ever thought about that yourself?

471
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,958
You chickened out?

472
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,389
How would you like-

473
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,955
to float farther or gravitate to the bottom?

474
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,956
Film them.

475
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,437
Hey, you fucking jerk,
takeaway your camera.

476
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:38,957
Keep filming.
Wereare you faggots going?

477
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,918
What the fuck did you say, bitch?

478
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,911
Shut the fuck up or

479
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,957
I'll throw you myself from this fuckin' bridge.

480
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:46,916
Stop or I'll jump.

481
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,949
You're sick. Idiot. Jump!
She'll do it for sure.

482
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,389
Look who is there.

483
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,955
I was wondering if this was the right place.

484
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:17,953
Do you have it?
I do.

485
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:31,951
Gaile, let me in.
Let me in.

486
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,912
You enjoy crying, you really do.

487
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:53,951
So you are gonna watch now and cry.
Let me in.

488
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,438
If I were killed
would you come to my funeral?

489
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:06,958
Makea video, huh?
Would you come, would you?

490
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,949
Gaile, please let me in.
Don't do this to me.

491
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,949
Gaile, give me your hand.
Step back. Film.

492
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,959
Hey you faggots,
where are you going?

493
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,913
Hey, guys, guys.
Guys what? Fuck it.

494
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,913
Who's the ass now,
who's the fucking ass?

495
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,959
People coming.
Let's get the fuck out of here, come on.

496
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,956
Hi.

497
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,959
I should've called you a while ago.

498
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,959
No, no, I guess it's tiredness.

499
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,950
I'm also very sorry.
Are you angry on me?

500
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,949
No, it's not because of that.
I had troubles. Yes.

501
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,959
What? That's great.

502
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,956
When?

503
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:20,953
OK. But let's meet in my place.
Bring Tom.

504
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:28,950
I havea surprise for you.
No, you'll see when you come.

505
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,949
OK, see you, bye.

506
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,912
I'm so glad we met.

507
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,958
We'll have a chat, therehas been a while.

508
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,917
Nice eyes shadows.

509
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,949
Who's there? The surprise? Finally.

510
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,911
Good evening.

511
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,959
Hi. I'm Lina.
Nice to meet you.

512
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,956
This is my husband, Tom.

513
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,958
My pleasure.

514
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,959
Sorry.
Help him baby, OK?

515
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:39,950
Help him baby, OK?

516
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:40,950
Help him baby, OK?

517
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,913
Can you imagine, this namby-pamby

518
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:57,959
would keep running away from me with guys.

519
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,959
I was small and so curious, you know.

520
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,959
So oncel caught her with a neighbour.

521
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,959
How old were you then?
Fourteen, I reckon.

522
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,951
Probably.

523
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,950
Maybe cigarette?
I just quit.

524
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,959
Did Gaile show you the pictures?
And dad's film?

525
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,956

You didn't, you liar.

Who do you think you are?

537
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,958
Sit there, I'll get it myself.

01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,958
What are you doing?
You werenot allowed.

539
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,917
What? You didn't expect that?

540
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,959
Don't you like it?
It's you who startle constantly.

01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,956
Sit down.

542
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,917

Sit down. I told you to sit.

Don't you need me anymore?

546
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:46,916
Stand back.

547
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,958
You think you are
the only one who count?

548
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,917
I hate you.

552
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,958
Myself.
