00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:09,306
- [Man] What a stupid place to live.

4
00:01:09,306 --> 00:01:10,448
- [Man] He must be important.

5
00:01:10,448 --> 00:01:14,087
- [Man] He is, he's that
adventurer guy, Sir John Gerad.

6
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:15,604
- [Man] Oh, the mountain climber.

7
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:17,775
Why does he live in such a shitty place?

8
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:18,951
- [Man] I don't know.

9
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:21,886
He's about a 100, lives
alone except for some old guy

10
00:01:21,886 --> 00:01:24,443
who looks after him during the day.

11
00:01:24,443 --> 00:01:26,120
- [Man] Tell me about the the curse.

12
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,926
- [Man] It's all bullshit.

13
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:29,540
- [Man] I don't care
whether it's bullshit,

14
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,118
just tell me about the curse.

15
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,252
- [Man] Whoever owns the
stone possesses eternal life.

16
00:01:34,252 --> 00:01:35,599
- [Man] That's terrible.

17
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,521
- [Man] Sounds good to me.

18
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:41,182
Although anyone who's ever
owned it ends up with nothing.

19

(easygoing rhythmic music)

20
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:48,873
- [Man] Well, what about him?

21
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:50,583
- [Man] He had it all once.

22
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:54,441
All he's got now is this old house.

23
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:57,743
(slow rhythmic music)

24
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,243
- Are you sure the old bloke's
the only one that lives here?

25
00:02:14,243 --> 00:02:15,329
- I'm sure.

26
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:19,318
Spends all day in bed sick, I think.

27
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:21,412
Probably dying.

28
00:02:21,412 --> 00:02:23,158
- I thought he had eternal life.

29
00:02:23,158 --> 00:02:25,205
- Yeah, well, I told you
that was all bullshit.

30
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:27,719
- Will ya do me a favor
with the credit card?

31
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,708
When you break into a house,

32
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:33,129
just check to see if
the door is (squeaking)

33
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:33,997
open.

34
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:38,745
(tense music)

35
00:02:44,704 --> 00:02:46,094
He's really old.

36
00:02:47,396 --> 00:02:50,625
- What'd I tell ya, he's a 103.

37
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,542
- That's really old.

38

(tense music)

39
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,251
It really stinks in here.

40
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:03,669

41
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:06,275
(tense music)

42
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:20,220
- What a messy old guy.

43
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,664
- Conrad.

44
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:24,270
(tense music)

45
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:37,708
- This is a really weird place.

46
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,221
- [Man In Corner] What?

47
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:42,075
- Doesn't matter.

48

(dramatic music)

51
00:03:56,882 --> 00:04:00,729
- That looks like a colored piece of shit.

52
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:02,706
- This piece of shit is a curse,

53
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:05,462
and people pay for a curse.

54
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:07,323

00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:12,781
- Whoo!
- Don't do that.

57
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:15,871
- You watch too many movies, man.

58
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:17,508

(tense music)

90
00:06:32,656 --> 00:06:35,519
- Not too much to pay for eternal life.

91
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,211

We've got some great clouds,

Oh, well you didn't tell him
I was gonna come back today.

me you were out of town

178

and you wouldn't be back for a fortnight.

179
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:27,720

I am leaving town, but not till tomorrow.

181

- Yeah, she must've made a mistake.

182
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:33,267
Don't know how a smart guy like you

183
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:36,045
can hire such a dumb bitch.

184
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:38,473
- So how you been keepin'?

185
00:11:38,473 --> 00:11:40,706
- Knockin' the deals
back with a baseball bat.

186
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:44,919
You know how it is in
this dog-eat-dog business.

187
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:47,343
Why do you care how I've been keeping?

188
00:11:47,343 --> 00:11:49,721
Look, I need some money, don't
tell me that times are tough.

189
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:50,649
Bullshit.

190
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:53,777
- We can talk about it in my office.

191
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:55,926
Pam.

192
00:11:55,926 --> 00:11:59,333
- Mr. Cordeaux, I wasn't
expecting you back.

193
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,381
- She's good.

194
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:03,843
How much do ya pay her to lie for ya?

195
00:12:03,843 --> 00:12:05,916
You been givin' her one?

196
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:06,872
- Charming.

197
00:12:10,441 --> 00:12:11,534
- [Mr. Cordeaux] Let's not waste time,

198
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:13,028
I've got a lot to do before I leave.

199
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:16,525
- [Davey-Joe] I'd hate to
slow the wheels of industry.

200
00:12:16,525 --> 00:12:18,180
- [Mr. Cordeaux] So, hi, Cindy.

201
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,191
- Hello.
- How are the job prospects?

202
00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:21,561
Not too good, I take it.

203
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:22,965
- [Davey-Joe] A man of my qualifications,

204
00:12:22,965 --> 00:12:24,977
no one wants to start me
where I should be starting,

205
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,094
at the top.

206
00:12:26,094 --> 00:12:28,734
- Yeah, things are tough.

207
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:30,594
- Yeah, tough.

208
00:12:30,594 --> 00:12:34,157
You got the whole box all nicely tied up.

209
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:38,895
- Nothing I haven't worked hard for.

210
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:41,341
Yeah, Pam, get ahold of Masterson,

211
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:43,499
tell him our legal departments
looking at the contracts,

212
00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:46,192
and we'll get back to
him as soon as we can.

213
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:47,148
Yeah, fine.

214
00:12:48,843 --> 00:12:51,457
I've got a business contact,
a delivery contractor.

215
00:12:51,457 --> 00:12:54,684
Might be able to swing you a job.

216
00:12:54,684 --> 00:12:56,484
- My license has lapsed.

217
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,316
- You'll be riding a pushbike.

218
00:12:58,316 --> 00:13:00,183
It's two-wheeled couriers.

219
00:13:00,183 --> 00:13:02,187
This is the bloke to see.

220
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:04,698
- I need the money now.

221
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:06,172
- Why?

222
00:13:06,172 --> 00:13:08,198
- I wanna go on a holiday.

223
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:09,262
- A holiday?

224
00:13:09,262 --> 00:13:12,745
- Our ever-loving sister
asked me to leave.

225
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:16,003
What do you think I'm here
kissing your butt for?

226
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,284
- I'll give ya 50 bucks.

227
00:13:18,284 --> 00:13:20,208
You go and see that company about the job.

228
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,077
- Fine.

229
00:13:24,154 --> 00:13:25,289
- Promise?

230
00:13:25,289 --> 00:13:26,158
- Yeah.

231
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,398
Done.

232
00:13:32,157 --> 00:13:35,546
(light rhythmic music)

233
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:42,708
(phone rings)

234
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:50,134
- Hello?

235
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:52,693
Hi, Alex.

236
00:13:52,693 --> 00:13:54,564
- Just had Davey-Joe in.

237
00:13:54,564 --> 00:13:56,138
He told me you asked him to leave.

238
00:13:56,138 --> 00:13:57,657
- I don't know who it's gonna be

239
00:13:57,657 --> 00:13:59,176
every time there's a
knock at the front door.

240
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:00,572
No, that's not true.

241
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:02,695
I'm always expecting the police.

242
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:04,908
I can't take it anymore, Alex.

243
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:08,722
I've got my hands full
with Caine as it is.

244
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,852
- The reason I called

245
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:13,703
was that I'm going up to, uh,

246
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:16,330
to a mountain for a fortnight.

247
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,529
Friend of mine's canceled
out at the last minute,

248
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:21,574
and I, uh, thought I might take Caine.

249
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:26,160
- Well, with Davey-Joe
gone, that would be a break.

250
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,037
A fortnight, I wouldn't
know what to do with myself.

251
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:31,296
- Get out, relax, and enjoy yourself.

252
00:14:31,296 --> 00:14:33,295
- (chuckles) Right.

253
00:14:33,295 --> 00:14:37,031
(easygoing rhythmic music)

254
00:14:42,102 --> 00:14:45,496
(TV chattering)

255
00:14:45,496 --> 00:14:47,986
Guess who's going on a camping trip?

256
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:50,046
Alex is gonna take you on a camping trip.

257
00:14:50,046 --> 00:14:51,784
Won't that be great?

258
00:14:52,696 --> 00:14:54,619
Yes, darling, that's good.

259
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:58,964

00:15:01,243 --> 00:15:03,764

- Ya heard wrong.

310
00:17:19,546 --> 00:17:20,463
You alone?

311
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:22,987
- Except for the cockroaches
and a couple of models.

312
00:17:22,987 --> 00:17:24,281
Got a job offer.

313
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:25,592
- [Davey] Can we talk?

314
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:27,287
- [Photographer] Yeah, but be
short about it, will ya, mate?

315
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:30,201
I don't wanna be paying
these two overtime.

316
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:33,134
Come on, ya moved on me.

317
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:35,601
Just lick your lips for me, come on.

318
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:37,374
- I've gotta get outta town.

319
00:17:37,374 --> 00:17:38,685
I still have Conrad breathing

320
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:39,896
down my neck.
- I know, mate.

321
00:17:39,896 --> 00:17:41,449
Come here lookin' for ya before.

322
00:17:41,449 --> 00:17:42,904
- Yeah?

323
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:44,712
Shit, ya owe me some bucks, man.

324
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:45,755
- Oh, right.

325
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,371
Bad timing.

326
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:49,796
I'm down to baked beans.

327
00:17:49,796 --> 00:17:52,174
What do you think I'm
doin' this art shot for?

328
00:17:52,174 --> 00:17:54,173
- This is not art, man.

329
00:17:56,934 --> 00:17:59,017
- [Photographer] Yeah, I see what ya mean.

330
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:00,571
Tilt your had back a bit.

331
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:03,771
- You owe me some dollars, Wacka.

332
00:18:03,771 --> 00:18:08,249
- Look, you know I'd give
it to you, if I had it.

333
00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:11,812
- Well, find it, rat face, I'm desperate!

334
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,478
- What's your problem?

335
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:18,867
- Just don't hold out on me, okay?

336
00:18:18,867 --> 00:18:20,019
- I'm just tryin' to help.

337
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:24,871
- Well, you can help by
getting me some money.

338
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:27,239
- Yeah, all right, uh,

339
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:31,584
you wait here and I'll go
and open the piggy bank.

340
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,534
(door thuds)

341
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:46,923
(tense rhythmic music)

342
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,036
- Bogey, you wanker!

343
00:18:57,634 --> 00:19:01,159
- Hey, does this mean we're finished now?

344
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:03,651
(rhythmic music)

345
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:04,520
- G'day.

346
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:06,888
- Shit.

347
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:12,454
- Sorry, mate.

348
00:19:13,346 --> 00:19:14,850
- Where's the stone?

349
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,309
(dog barks)

350
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:19,169
- [Woman] Beats me why you
waste your time with Davey-Joe.

351
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:20,965
- [Alex] It beats me, too.

352
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:23,879
- Well, why don't you just
wash your hands of him?

353
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:24,748
- Can't.

354
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:27,775
He's family.

355
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:29,093
- Family?

356
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:32,496
Family doesn't treat you
the way Davey-Joe does.

357
00:19:32,496 --> 00:19:35,052
How much did you give him this time?

358
00:19:35,052 --> 00:19:37,211
- Oh, not much.

359
00:19:37,211 --> 00:19:38,981
- How much is not much?

360
00:19:38,981 --> 00:19:42,487
(gentle music)

361
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:44,138
- Will you drop it?

362
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:47,818
- What's the matter, Alex?

363
00:19:48,797 --> 00:19:51,126
- Gary dropped out of the trip.

364
00:19:51,126 --> 00:19:54,099
- I'm sorry, what a shame, why?

365
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:57,748
- (chuckles) Business pressures.

366
00:19:57,748 --> 00:20:01,572
(gentle instrumental music)

367
00:20:03,768 --> 00:20:06,801
- So, what are you gonna do
with two weeks on your hands?

368
00:20:06,801 --> 00:20:08,236
- Oh, I'm still going.

369
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:09,861
- On your own?

370
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:11,706
- No, I'm taking Caine.

371
00:20:11,706 --> 00:20:13,766
- Caine, are you out of your mind?

372
00:20:13,766 --> 00:20:15,659
- I'm taking Caine.

373
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:18,376
- I know he's your brother,
but he's not exactly--

374
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:19,470
- Normal?

375
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,339
- Yeah.

376
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:25,040
(gentle instrumental music)

377
00:20:28,535 --> 00:20:30,415
Ever since we got back from the States,

378
00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:32,363
you've been more occupied with your family

379
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:33,586
than you hae with us.

380
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:35,517
- That's because I was away then,

381
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:37,294
but not that I'm back,
I wanna make more effort

382
00:20:37,294 --> 00:20:39,081
of being with them, that's all.

383
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:40,802
- You make enough of an effort.

384
00:20:40,802 --> 00:20:42,176
Good God, you lend them money,

385
00:20:42,176 --> 00:20:44,228
you bought Muriel her apartment.

386
00:20:44,228 --> 00:20:46,520
What more do you wanna do?

387
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,526
- I'm going and I'm taking Caine with me.

388
00:20:49,526 --> 00:20:53,350
(gentle instrumental music)

389
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,492
(TV chattering)

390
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,723
(gentle instrumental music)

391
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,487
- [Girl] Caine!

392
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,254
Caine, where are you?

393
00:21:22,254 --> 00:21:23,122
Caine!

394
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:26,136
Caine!

395
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,933
(screaming)

396
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:36,757
(gentle instrumental music)

397
00:21:37,688 --> 00:21:40,469
(TV chattering)

398
00:21:44,952 --> 00:21:47,546
- When are you going to
start spending time with us?

399
00:21:47,546 --> 00:21:48,992
- Give us a break, will ya?

400
00:21:48,992 --> 00:21:50,833
- We hardly ever see you anymore.

401
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,740
Billy's beginning to
question who the stranger is

402
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,020
who comes home at night.

403
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,493
- I don't need this, Dianne.

404
00:21:55,493 --> 00:21:57,667
- You could've canceled the
trip when Gary backed out.

405
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:58,843
You should've asked Billy.

406
00:21:58,843 --> 00:22:01,329
- It's not for me, it's for Caine!

407
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:03,384
He's got no life, he's got nothing.

408
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:05,382
- Is this your way of
cleansing your conscience

409
00:22:05,382 --> 00:22:07,728
about what happened to him?

410
00:22:17,443 --> 00:22:19,963
(TV chatter)

411
00:22:24,236 --> 00:22:27,104
(dramatic music)

412
00:22:36,244 --> 00:22:38,658
- Don't forget to wear
your hat in the sun.

413
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:39,921
Now, you'll need plenty of

414
00:22:39,921 --> 00:22:44,092
warm clothing, so.
(phone rings)

415
00:22:50,391 --> 00:22:51,259
Hello?

416
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:54,127
(dramatic music)

417
00:23:02,027 --> 00:23:03,934
That was Alex, he said he's gonna be here

418
00:23:03,934 --> 00:23:05,583
at 7:30 in the morning.

419
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,717
Oh, I wish it wasn't so early.

420
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:09,195
Now, where was I?

421
00:23:10,663 --> 00:23:13,341
(gentle instrumental music)

422
00:23:13,341 --> 00:23:16,237
- [Driver] See ya later, Billy.

423
00:23:16,237 --> 00:23:18,995
See ya in the morning.

424
00:23:18,995 --> 00:23:22,819
(gentle instrumental music)

425
00:23:26,643 --> 00:23:27,588
- [Alex] Billy?

426
00:23:27,588 --> 00:23:29,827
- Yeah, I'm out here, Dad.

427
00:23:29,827 --> 00:23:33,297
(gentle instrumental music)

428
00:23:33,297 --> 00:23:34,368
- Where ya been?

429
00:23:34,368 --> 00:23:36,628
- Oh, just hangin' around.

430
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:39,362
- Get lucky?

431
00:23:39,362 --> 00:23:40,230
- Come on.

432
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,393
(chuckling)

433
00:23:42,393 --> 00:23:44,044
- Been with Jeff?

434
00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:45,694
- What's with all the questions?

435
00:23:45,694 --> 00:23:47,756
- Ah, just like to know
what you've been up to.

436
00:23:47,756 --> 00:23:49,649
- Hey, that's a change.

437
00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:52,586
- Yeah, we haven't seen too
much of each other, have we?

438
00:23:52,586 --> 00:23:54,585
- Well, I've been here.

439
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,753
- Gary's pulled out of the trip.

440
00:23:58,753 --> 00:23:59,621
- Oh.

441
00:23:59,621 --> 00:24:01,614
- You know, I was wondering if maybe.

442
00:24:01,614 --> 00:24:03,556
- Ah, I've got other plans.

443
00:24:03,556 --> 00:24:05,473
- Nothing that can't be changed.

444
00:24:05,473 --> 00:24:06,342
- No.

445
00:24:07,511 --> 00:24:09,210
- Yeah, it'd be a great trip.

446
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,519
Two weeks,

447
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:11,668
no women.

448
00:24:11,668 --> 00:24:13,854
(chuckles)

449
00:24:13,854 --> 00:24:16,048
No responsibility.

450
00:24:16,048 --> 00:24:18,622
- The guys are really counting on me.

451
00:24:18,622 --> 00:24:19,574
- Yeah.

452
00:24:19,574 --> 00:24:21,892
- You're leaving first
thing in the morning?

453
00:24:21,892 --> 00:24:23,347
- Yeah.

454
00:24:23,347 --> 00:24:24,901
- Well, Pete's picking me up early,

455
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:27,527
but I might see you before then.

456
00:24:27,527 --> 00:24:29,457
- That'd be nice.

457
00:24:29,457 --> 00:24:31,425
- [Billy] Goodnight.

458
00:24:31,425 --> 00:24:35,249
(gentle instrumental music)

459
00:24:42,456 --> 00:24:45,063
(phone rings)

460
00:24:49,103 --> 00:24:51,917
(water sprinkles)

461
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:54,524
(phone rings)

462
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:02,356
(horse neighs)

463
00:25:03,825 --> 00:25:04,694
- Hello?

464
00:25:06,363 --> 00:25:08,331
- Hello to yourself, Sis.

465
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:09,589
Muriel, I was wondering--

466
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:11,508
- Davey, no, that was the last time.

467
00:25:11,508 --> 00:25:12,938
You and your weirdo friends can go

468
00:25:12,938 --> 00:25:14,623
and ruin somebody else's life.

469
00:25:14,623 --> 00:25:16,115
I'm not having you, them,

470
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:20,122
or your drugs anywhere
near my place again.

471
00:25:20,122 --> 00:25:24,555
(rhythmic music)
(voices drowned out by music)

472
00:25:24,555 --> 00:25:25,881
- The bitch is there, come on,

473
00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:27,688
we just have to wait till she goes out.

474
00:25:27,688 --> 00:25:28,989
- Oh, I see.

475
00:25:28,989 --> 00:25:30,199
Well, it better be there, Davey.

476
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:32,224
- It's there!
- It better be there!

477
00:25:32,224 --> 00:25:34,202
Conrad, get him in the car.

478
00:25:34,202 --> 00:25:35,680
- Get in the car.

479
00:25:36,717 --> 00:25:38,389
- What was that for?

480
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:40,354
- 'Cause you stink.

481
00:25:40,354 --> 00:25:42,787
(chuckling)

482
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:54,519
- [Dianne] So you're
going where we used to go?

483
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,778
- Yeah, it's a nice place.

484
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,081
I better make directions.

485
00:26:03,081 --> 00:26:04,377
- Bye.

486
00:26:04,377 --> 00:26:08,555
(gentle instrumental music)

487
00:26:08,555 --> 00:26:10,451
Have a good time.

488
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:14,275
(gentle instrumental music)

489
00:26:16,292 --> 00:26:19,160
(engine rumbles)

490
00:26:39,013 --> 00:26:41,533
(horn beeps)

491
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:44,074
- Alex is here.

492
00:26:45,336 --> 00:26:47,604
Turn that down, darling.

493
00:26:47,604 --> 00:26:51,752
(boinging)
(beeping)

494
00:26:51,752 --> 00:26:54,185
(whistling)

495
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,141
(chuckling)

496
00:26:59,141 --> 00:27:01,932
- Hey, sis.
- Hello, stranger.

497
00:27:01,932 --> 00:27:02,916
- How are ya?

498
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:04,238
- [Muriel] Oh, good.

499
00:27:04,238 --> 00:27:05,477
- And where's that man you love?

500
00:27:05,477 --> 00:27:06,781
- Oh, he's through there.

501
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:08,731
He's still costing me
a fortune in Polaroids.

502
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:09,600
(chuckling)

503
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,780
- Want some money?

504
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,698
- No, I'm all right.

505
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:15,479
(TV chattering)

506
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:18,212
- Caine,

507
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,051
you ready for your,

508
00:27:23,032 --> 00:27:25,711
you ready for the big adventure?

509
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:28,492
(TV chattering)

510
00:27:41,273 --> 00:27:42,777
Don't worry about him.

511
00:27:42,777 --> 00:27:44,450
You have a good time for two weeks.

512
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,526
- Don't forget, patience.

513
00:27:46,526 --> 00:27:49,004
(chuckling)

514
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:50,597
- Phone ya from the ranger's station.

515
00:27:50,597 --> 00:27:52,075
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

516
00:28:03,062 --> 00:28:04,973
- Take a photo, go on.

517
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:09,209
(camera clicks)

518
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:10,988
Give it to me.

519
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:12,479
Give it to me.

520
00:28:12,479 --> 00:28:13,348
Here.

521
00:28:15,202 --> 00:28:17,355
(camera clicks)

522
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:21,091
(easygoing rhythmic music)

523
00:29:04,556 --> 00:29:06,583
(camera clicks)

524
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:10,319
(easygoing rhythmic music)

525
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,872
- [Davey] Anytime now.

526
00:29:13,872 --> 00:29:15,946
She always goes out in the mornings.

527
00:29:15,946 --> 00:29:19,818
Shopping, bitch lives for shopping.

528
00:29:19,818 --> 00:29:20,860
There ya go.

529
00:29:23,325 --> 00:29:25,497
- You got five minutes, Davey.

530
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,122
- Five minutes?

531
00:29:27,122 --> 00:29:28,165
No problems.

532
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,347
- You should've given him longer.

533
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:34,269
- Why?

534
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:36,528
- So he could have a bath.

535
00:30:07,553 --> 00:30:11,289
(tense instrumental music)

536
00:30:15,518 --> 00:30:16,546
- Hi, Muriel.

537
00:30:16,546 --> 00:30:17,415
- Hi.

538
00:30:18,673 --> 00:30:19,542
Oh.

539
00:30:22,726 --> 00:30:23,595
Ah, oh!

540
00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:27,736
(thudding)

541
00:30:27,736 --> 00:30:31,472
(tense instrumental music)

542
00:30:33,843 --> 00:30:34,711
- Shit.

543
00:30:37,165 --> 00:30:39,132
- You really want this stone, don't you?

544
00:30:39,132 --> 00:30:41,983
- Yes, Conrad, for the last
time, I really want the stone.

545
00:30:41,983 --> 00:30:43,704
Don't you?

546
00:30:43,704 --> 00:30:44,572
- Sure.

547
00:30:46,969 --> 00:30:49,425
- Hey, the babe's back.

548
00:30:49,425 --> 00:30:51,647
- Really.
- Yes, really.

549
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:55,383
(tense instrumental music)

550
00:31:03,865 --> 00:31:05,398
- Davey, I thought I told--

551
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:06,438
- Where is it?

552
00:31:06,438 --> 00:31:07,362
- What?
- The package,

553
00:31:07,362 --> 00:31:08,610
I had it hidden in Caine's room.

554
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,507
Where's Caine?

555
00:31:09,507 --> 00:31:10,412
- He's away.

556
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:12,019
I don't know anything about your package.

557
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:14,702
Look, Davey, what is all this about?

558
00:31:14,702 --> 00:31:16,847
(tense music)

559
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:19,107
- We got a problem, Davey?

560
00:31:20,121 --> 00:31:22,989
(birds chirping)

561
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:35,992
- Now, uh, Caine, you stay here.

562
00:31:35,992 --> 00:31:37,411
I'm gonna go and see the ranger,

563
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:39,758
and then I'll phone Muriel.

564
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:45,746
(camera clicks)

565
00:31:45,746 --> 00:31:48,745
(birds chirp)

566
00:31:48,745 --> 00:31:49,872
- Can I help you there?

567
00:31:49,872 --> 00:31:51,631
- Uh, Ranger,

568
00:31:51,631 --> 00:31:53,547
going up the mountain
for a couple of weeks.

569
00:31:53,547 --> 00:31:56,473
Thought I'd leave you some details.

570
00:31:56,473 --> 00:31:57,466
- That the route?

571
00:31:57,466 --> 00:31:58,438
- Yeah.

572
00:31:58,438 --> 00:31:59,809
- Good.

573
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:01,276
You seem well organized.

574
00:32:01,276 --> 00:32:04,034
- Yeah, just myself
and my younger brother.

575
00:32:04,034 --> 00:32:05,892
- Hey, how ya doin' there?

576
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:07,542
- Oh, he doesn't talk.

577
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:08,926
Can I use your phone?

578
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:11,272
- Yeah, it's in the office.

579
00:32:15,989 --> 00:32:17,357
(camera clicks)

580
00:32:17,357 --> 00:32:21,093
(tense instrumental music)

581
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:26,467
- Well, it's not here, Davey, or is it?

582
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:27,748
It's just not here.

583
00:32:27,748 --> 00:32:29,148
- It's here, I swear.

584
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:30,948
Tell them, Mure, otherwise
he's gonna shoot me.

585
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:32,284
- How can I tell them anything,

586
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,838
if I don't know what you're looking for?

587
00:32:33,838 --> 00:32:35,560
- Caine, he's taken it.
(phone rings)

588
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,109
He's always knocking things off.

589
00:32:37,109 --> 00:32:38,686
- Where you goin'?

590
00:32:38,686 --> 00:32:39,877
- Answer the phone.

591
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:40,746
- Why?

592
00:32:40,746 --> 00:32:41,657
- 'Cause it's ringing.

593
00:32:41,657 --> 00:32:42,526
- Stay there.

594
00:32:42,526 --> 00:32:43,517
(sharp smacking)

595
00:32:43,517 --> 00:32:45,084
Who's Caine?

596
00:32:45,084 --> 00:32:48,820
(tense instrumental music)

597
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:57,529
- You pin that on yourself.

598
00:32:57,529 --> 00:33:00,056
I'll be lookin' after you.

599
00:33:00,056 --> 00:33:03,792
(tense instrumental music)

600
00:33:08,326 --> 00:33:10,167
(dramatic music)

601
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:13,070
- He's my older bro, not the full quid.

602
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,555
- And he conveniently
went on this camping trip

603
00:33:15,555 --> 00:33:16,807
with this Alex guy?

604
00:33:16,807 --> 00:33:19,119
- You heard her, I don't
know nothin' about it.

605
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,283
- And Caine's your brother?

606
00:33:20,283 --> 00:33:21,230
- Yeah.

607
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,480
- And Alex is your brother?

608
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,729
- Yes, yes.

609
00:33:23,729 --> 00:33:25,782
- You got any other brothers?

610
00:33:25,782 --> 00:33:28,456
- Somebody must know where they are.

611
00:33:28,456 --> 00:33:30,140
(snaps)

612
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,513
- His old lady.

613
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:33,198
- Whose old lady?

614
00:33:33,198 --> 00:33:36,066
- [Conrad And Sole] His old lady.

615
00:33:37,264 --> 00:33:41,000
(tense instrumental music)

616
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:45,472
- Now, you folks have
yourselves a good trip.

617
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,798
You got plenty up there
to keep you occupied.

618
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:49,243
- We plan to make the most of it.

619
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:51,924
- By the way, watch that
river, she can be very tricky.

620
00:33:51,924 --> 00:33:53,878
- We'll be taking it nice and easy.

621
00:33:53,878 --> 00:33:56,050
Oh, thanks for the use of the phone.

622
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,918
(engine rumbles)

623
00:33:59,814 --> 00:34:03,550
(tense instrumental music)

624
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:08,400
- [Billy] It's here.

625
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,269
- Thank you.

626
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:12,170
Billy, give me the report card.

627
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,801
- [Billy] It's not that
bad, you'll really like it.

628
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,579
- Fine, give it to me.

629
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:19,152
Now.
(chuckles)

630
00:34:19,152 --> 00:34:24,017
Another D, Billy, come
on, this is your fifth D.

631
00:34:24,017 --> 00:34:25,290
This has gotta stop.

632
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,443
- I'll try harder.

633
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:29,040
- Another D.

634
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,734
(ringing)
Fine.

635
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:35,704
- Mrs. Cordeaux?

636
00:34:35,704 --> 00:34:36,573
- [Dianne] Yes.

637
00:34:36,573 --> 00:34:38,335
- Oh, good, I've got the right place.

638
00:34:38,335 --> 00:34:39,865
Could I speak to your husband?

639
00:34:39,865 --> 00:34:41,102
- Oh, I'm sorry, he's not here.

640
00:34:41,102 --> 00:34:43,029
He won't be back for about two weeks.

641
00:34:43,029 --> 00:34:45,209
- Two weeks, oh.

642
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:46,734
I didn't plan on that.

643
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:49,309
Is there somewhere I can contact him?

644
00:34:49,309 --> 00:34:50,265
- Well, I doubt it.

645
00:34:50,265 --> 00:34:52,126
He's on a camping trip in the mountains,

646
00:34:52,126 --> 00:34:54,694
but, look if you want to
tell me what this is about,

647
00:34:54,694 --> 00:34:56,163
maybe I can help or.

648
00:34:56,163 --> 00:34:59,630
- Surely you must know
where he can be contacted?

649
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,642
- Yes, but, uh, why don't you
leave me your name and number,

650
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,082
and then when he gets back,
I can have him call you.

651
00:35:05,082 --> 00:35:09,103
- So you have an idea of his whereabouts?

652
00:35:09,103 --> 00:35:10,723
- Yes.

653
00:35:10,723 --> 00:35:13,030
Why don't you just come
back in two weeks, okay?

654
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,093
(yells)
(dramatic music)

655
00:35:15,093 --> 00:35:16,476
- You, over here.

656
00:35:16,476 --> 00:35:19,072
- Come on, just do as he says.

657
00:35:19,072 --> 00:35:21,678
(tense music)

658
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,438
(thudding)

659
00:35:27,438 --> 00:35:30,483
- Why did you put him in the trunk?

660
00:35:30,483 --> 00:35:34,211
- Because it's bigger than the ashtray.

661
00:35:34,211 --> 00:35:36,992
(Sole whistles)

662
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:45,281
(gentle rhythmic music)

663
00:35:50,434 --> 00:35:54,137
- Here we are, Caine, the jumper.

664
00:35:54,137 --> 00:35:56,744
Let's get out and have a look.

665
00:35:58,694 --> 00:35:59,910
Come on, mate.

666
00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:04,268
The water's not going to reach you.

667
00:36:04,268 --> 00:36:07,203
We went fishing that time, remember?

668
00:36:07,203 --> 00:36:09,463
Come on, put the bag down.

669
00:36:11,304 --> 00:36:14,045
Okay, bring the back with you.

670
00:36:14,045 --> 00:36:17,869
(gentle instrumental music)

671
00:36:27,742 --> 00:36:30,233
Come on, Caine, don't be nervous.

672
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:32,328
It's gonna be all right,
we're gonna have some fun.

673
00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:34,701
- [Davey] You're gonna kill
me, there's no air, no air!

674
00:36:34,701 --> 00:36:36,216
- Now you know what you smell like.

675
00:36:36,216 --> 00:36:37,805
- All right, sweet thing,
where do we find your old man?

676
00:36:37,805 --> 00:36:39,274
- Why are you doing this?

677
00:36:39,274 --> 00:36:41,263
- You, come here, what's your name?

678
00:36:41,263 --> 00:36:42,414
I said what's your name?

679
00:36:42,414 --> 00:36:43,283
- All right!

680
00:36:43,283 --> 00:36:44,898
I'll tell you what you wanna know.

681
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:47,022
- Never doubted for a minute you wouldn't.

682
00:36:47,022 --> 00:36:48,174
Take her, get some coffee,

683
00:36:48,174 --> 00:36:50,458
while me and sweet thing here have a chat.

684
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,501
- Thank you.

685
00:36:55,871 --> 00:36:58,780
- Where's Davey's brother?

686
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,802
- I told you he's gone camping.

687
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,670
- Where?

688
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,505
- Sher Mountain Park.

689
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,979
- Where in Sher Mountain Park?

690
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:12,586
(tense music)

691
00:37:13,923 --> 00:37:17,052
- We used to camp
somewhere along the river.

692
00:37:17,052 --> 00:37:18,790
- You've been there?

693
00:37:20,269 --> 00:37:21,138
Look,

694
00:37:22,354 --> 00:37:24,614
this Caine guy, this mute,

695
00:37:26,648 --> 00:37:28,908
he's got somethin' I want.

696
00:37:30,437 --> 00:37:32,523
And I want it bad.

697
00:37:32,523 --> 00:37:35,532
- All I can tell you is there's a,

698
00:37:35,532 --> 00:37:38,479
there's a map next to
the old ranger's station.

699
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:39,997
They'll be somewhere along the river,

700
00:37:39,997 --> 00:37:43,472
and there's a walking trail right there.

701
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,568
- Good.

702
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,419
Very good.

703
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:57,152
- You wait till we get out there.

704
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:58,020
Very good.

705
00:37:59,158 --> 00:38:00,896
Put your stuff down.

706
00:38:07,249 --> 00:38:11,152
- What do you intend doing with us?

707
00:38:11,152 --> 00:38:12,021
- Nothing.

708
00:38:15,331 --> 00:38:17,677
Just make the coffee, girl.

709
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:21,385
- How do you like it?

710
00:38:23,496 --> 00:38:24,799
- Milk and two.

711
00:38:28,202 --> 00:38:30,983
I don't want anything like this.

712
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,075
You know what I mean?

713
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:40,492
I don't wanna hurt you.

714
00:38:43,178 --> 00:38:46,132
I don't wanna hurt the little boy.

715
00:38:47,948 --> 00:38:50,816
I just wanna help my idiot friend

716
00:38:51,776 --> 00:38:53,601
get this idiot stone.

717
00:38:58,285 --> 00:39:00,495
Where does it hurt you?

718
00:39:00,495 --> 00:39:03,449
(kettle whistles)

719
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:08,353
(tense rhythmic music)

720
00:39:08,353 --> 00:39:10,438
(yells)

721
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,945
- Stay here, weasel.

722
00:39:13,945 --> 00:39:15,341
Don't move.

723
00:39:15,341 --> 00:39:16,832
Get her, man.

724
00:39:16,832 --> 00:39:17,701
You idiot!

725
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:20,544
- That's an understatement, Sole.

726
00:39:20,544 --> 00:39:23,182
- Get out, just get
out and leave us alone.

727
00:39:23,182 --> 00:39:25,477
- Exactly what I had in mind.

728
00:39:25,477 --> 00:39:28,305
(tense rhythmic music)

729
00:39:28,305 --> 00:39:29,942
- Why don't ya let me hold that, baby?

730
00:39:29,942 --> 00:39:30,811
- Shut up!

731
00:39:30,811 --> 00:39:33,641
- Come on, Conrad, come on!

732
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:36,699
- Now where does it hurt you, baby?

733
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:38,511
(tense music)

734
00:39:38,511 --> 00:39:39,824
- Come on, Conrad.

735
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:41,760
Listen, we're gonna back
outta here to the car,

736
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,108
nice and easy.

737
00:39:43,108 --> 00:39:44,040
- Billy.

738
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,603
Please, don't hurt him,

739
00:39:45,603 --> 00:39:47,153
please.
- Just insurance till we get

740
00:39:47,153 --> 00:39:48,713
to the car.

741
00:39:48,713 --> 00:39:51,099
One more step and this kid is history.

742
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:52,185
- Stink, do I?

743
00:39:52,185 --> 00:39:53,557
(tense music)

744
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,425
- Billy!

745
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,987
(tense rhythmic music)

746
00:39:56,987 --> 00:39:58,986
- Get in there, get in!

747
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:04,938
- Don't even think about it,

748
00:40:04,938 --> 00:40:07,740
especially you, ya blonde bitch.

749
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:11,128
(tense rhythmic music)

750
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:21,347
(tires squeal)

751
00:40:21,347 --> 00:40:24,128
(insects chirp)

752
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,489
(camera clicks)

753
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:35,270
(insects chirp)

754
00:40:41,345 --> 00:40:43,213
- What the hell were you doin' back there?

755
00:40:43,213 --> 00:40:44,331
- Nothing.
- What do you mean nothing?

756
00:40:44,331 --> 00:40:45,359
What were you doin'?

757
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,228
- Nothing.

758
00:40:46,228 --> 00:40:47,674
- You could've blown the whole thing.

759
00:40:47,674 --> 00:40:48,543
- I know.

760
00:40:48,543 --> 00:40:49,916
- She's got your gun, asshole.

761
00:40:49,916 --> 00:40:51,103
- Yeah, that's a real problem.

762
00:40:51,103 --> 00:40:52,887
- What the hell is going on here?

763
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:53,980
Who are you guys?

764
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,891
- Shut up!

765
00:40:54,891 --> 00:40:56,359
- [Dianne] I'm calling the police.

766
00:40:56,359 --> 00:40:57,839
- [Davey] No police.

767
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,149
If you wanna see Billy alive,

768
00:40:59,149 --> 00:41:00,666
you won't go near the police.

769
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,701
- For God's sake, Davey,
who are these men?

770
00:41:03,701 --> 00:41:04,974
- Some mates.

771
00:41:04,974 --> 00:41:06,384
- Mates?

772
00:41:06,384 --> 00:41:09,980
Who are they, tell me who
they are, what do they want?

773
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,888
Tell me!
- Dianne!

774
00:41:11,888 --> 00:41:13,400
Take it easy!

775
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,269
Take it easy!

776
00:41:14,269 --> 00:41:16,024
- I will not take it easy.

777
00:41:16,024 --> 00:41:18,289
- Muriel, talk some sense into her.

778
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:19,843
- Dianne,

779
00:41:19,843 --> 00:41:21,076
give me the gun.

780
00:41:21,076 --> 00:41:23,330
(tense rhythmic music)

781
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:25,310
Give me the gun.

782
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:29,439
- Not until I know
where I can find my son.

783
00:41:29,439 --> 00:41:31,681
- Give me the gun.

784
00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:34,288
(tense music)

785
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:40,891
(crying)

786
00:41:44,216 --> 00:41:46,886
Everything's gonna be all right, Dianne.

787
00:41:46,886 --> 00:41:48,161
We'll get Billy back.

788
00:41:48,161 --> 00:41:49,029
- Sure.

789
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:53,649
- Do you think they'll
be able to find him?

790
00:41:53,649 --> 00:41:55,281
- I don't know.

791
00:41:55,281 --> 00:41:56,838
I told them they'd be by the river,

792
00:41:56,838 --> 00:41:59,695
but they could be anywhere.

793
00:41:59,695 --> 00:42:01,537
- We're gonna have to go after them.

794
00:42:01,537 --> 00:42:03,034
- You can count me out.

795
00:42:03,034 --> 00:42:04,904
- Don't even think about it.

796
00:42:04,904 --> 00:42:06,387
You got us into this mess,

797
00:42:06,387 --> 00:42:08,943
you're gonna start getting us out,

798
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:12,071
or I'll ruddy-well shoot you myself.

799
00:42:13,253 --> 00:42:17,065
- Over there, Caine, paddle,
just right, paddle here.

800
00:42:17,065 --> 00:42:20,888
(gentle instrumental music)

801
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:26,008
- Are you out of your mind?

802
00:42:26,008 --> 00:42:28,316
We are no match for them.

803
00:42:28,316 --> 00:42:30,004
- Either you go up the mountains,

804
00:42:30,004 --> 00:42:31,664
or I'll call the police.

805
00:42:31,664 --> 00:42:32,658
- What about Billy?

806
00:42:32,658 --> 00:42:34,277
If you call the police,
they're gonna kill him.

807
00:42:34,277 --> 00:42:35,646
Come on, let's go.

808
00:42:35,646 --> 00:42:37,974
- What are we going to do?

809
00:42:37,974 --> 00:42:39,214
- Well,

810
00:42:39,214 --> 00:42:41,152
we've got a gun.

811
00:42:41,152 --> 00:42:43,289
- Please, can we just go?

812
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:47,025
(tense instrumental music)

813
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:51,636
- Nice leveled spot, Caine.

814
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:53,873
What is it?

815
00:42:54,788 --> 00:42:56,884
Have you lost the bag?

816
00:42:56,884 --> 00:42:59,490
(tense music)

817
00:43:03,824 --> 00:43:07,352
Don't worry, Caine, don't
worry about the bag.

818
00:43:07,352 --> 00:43:09,873
We'll look for it afterwards.

819
00:43:23,563 --> 00:43:24,432
- Got it.

820
00:43:25,915 --> 00:43:27,387
You look like shit.

821
00:43:27,387 --> 00:43:29,119
- I feel like shit.

822
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,364
I got fluid runnin' out of me everywhere.

823
00:43:31,364 --> 00:43:32,589
- I gotta go to the toilet.

824
00:43:32,589 --> 00:43:33,458
- Hold on.

825
00:43:34,397 --> 00:43:36,550
It's for your shoulder, not your head.

826
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,767
- Yeah, right.

827
00:43:38,914 --> 00:43:39,800
- You'll feel a lot better

828
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,123
once you get your hands on that stone.

829
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:46,954
(tense instrumental music)

830
00:43:46,954 --> 00:43:49,780
- I'm doing a job for
Sole, he's the black dude.

831
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,609
He owns this restaurant in the city,

832
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:53,528
but he's into about everything else.

833
00:43:53,528 --> 00:43:55,785
Last of the free traders.

834
00:43:55,785 --> 00:43:58,199
At least that's what he thinks of himself.

835
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:00,364
So he picks up on this
really trippy old guy,

836
00:44:00,364 --> 00:44:02,014
and old-time adventurer,

837
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,051
who's spent his life hunting and exploring

838
00:44:04,051 --> 00:44:05,481
all around the world.

839
00:44:05,481 --> 00:44:08,625
Sole hears about this precious
stone, some kind of gem.

840
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:11,149
- You mean Billy's been
kidnapped because of a stone?

841
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:13,537
- Not just any ordinary stone.

842
00:44:13,537 --> 00:44:14,800
It's worth millions.

843
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,940
It's got a curse, magical properties.

844
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,274
- [Muriel] Oh, Davey, how
could you be so stupid?

845
00:44:20,274 --> 00:44:22,879
- Stupid, I could be rolling in it.

846
00:44:22,879 --> 00:44:25,359
All I needed was enough
to get out of town.

847
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,625
Wait a month or two till
Sole cools his heels,

848
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:32,311
then pick up the phone and talk turkey.

849
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:34,642
But he has it figured out all
along he's gonna get rid of me

850
00:44:34,642 --> 00:44:36,559
the moment I hand over the stone.

851
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:39,738
- [Dianne] Well, that's just great.

852
00:44:39,738 --> 00:44:42,431
(gentle music)

853
00:44:55,642 --> 00:44:57,038
- Caine,

854
00:44:57,038 --> 00:44:57,907
thanks.

855
00:45:06,587 --> 00:45:08,955
We'll get some dinner.

856
00:45:08,955 --> 00:45:10,085
Take a photo.

857
00:45:11,066 --> 00:45:13,847
(camera clicks)

858
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:15,828
Shh.

859
00:45:16,969 --> 00:45:18,358
That's a rabbit.

860
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,664
Come on, Caine.

861
00:45:25,964 --> 00:45:29,353
(tense rhythmic music)

862
00:45:35,808 --> 00:45:38,676
- I'm gonna go check out the map.

863
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,546
- I gotta take a pee.

864
00:45:44,546 --> 00:45:45,904
- Hold on to it.

865
00:45:45,904 --> 00:45:47,408
- [Ranger] Can I help you then?

866
00:45:47,408 --> 00:45:49,943
- This, uh, walking trail near the river

867
00:45:49,943 --> 00:45:51,763
looks like a good place to start.

868
00:45:51,763 --> 00:45:53,516
- It's a great place,
just follow the arrows.

869
00:45:53,516 --> 00:45:54,384
You can't miss it.

870
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,253
- [Sole] Oh.

871
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,435
- Um, there's a washing room inside,

872
00:45:56,435 --> 00:45:57,517
if you wanna freshen up.

873
00:45:57,517 --> 00:46:00,136
- No, I think we'll take a rain
check, thanks all the same.

874
00:46:00,136 --> 00:46:01,690
- Suit yourselves.

875
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,528
(tense instrumental music)

876
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:04,969
- Yes!

877
00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:06,547
The walking trail.

878
00:46:06,547 --> 00:46:08,184
- The walking trail?

879
00:46:08,184 --> 00:46:12,187
- Walking, it's gonna lead
us straight to the stone

880
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:14,186
and the good life, man.

881
00:46:15,717 --> 00:46:17,901
- Did you feel that before?

882
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:18,944
- Feel what?

883
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,620
- Nothing.

884
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,641
- Conrad, man.

885
00:46:23,641 --> 00:46:27,030
(tense rhythmic music)

886
00:46:36,709 --> 00:46:38,710
(chuckling)

887
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,491
- I can smell it cooking, Caine.

888
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:45,397
He's not too far ahead.

889
00:46:45,397 --> 00:46:48,785
Stay close. (chuckles)

890
00:47:11,965 --> 00:47:14,137
(crying)

891
00:47:16,986 --> 00:47:18,246
(knocking)
- [Muriel] Dianne.

892
00:47:18,246 --> 00:47:19,115
- Yeah?

893
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:25,138
- We're losing precious minutes.

894
00:47:25,138 --> 00:47:27,040
- I'm ready.

895
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,564
- We're going to find Billy.

896
00:47:29,564 --> 00:47:30,432
- I know.

897
00:47:37,448 --> 00:47:39,896
- He's not in the van.

898
00:47:39,896 --> 00:47:41,257
You go out on the path and get this thing

899
00:47:41,257 --> 00:47:44,244
and I'll stay here with the kid.

900
00:47:44,244 --> 00:47:45,511
- I got a better idea.

901
00:47:45,511 --> 00:47:46,379
- Sure.

902
00:47:46,379 --> 00:47:49,160
- We stick together like always.

903
00:47:50,338 --> 00:47:51,206
- Walking?

904
00:47:52,109 --> 00:47:52,985
- Walking.

905
00:47:52,985 --> 00:47:54,718
- Great.

906
00:47:54,718 --> 00:47:56,803
- I've gotta take a pee.

907
00:47:58,011 --> 00:47:59,524
- [Conrad And Sole] Hold on to it.

908
00:47:59,524 --> 00:48:00,392
- Shh.

909
00:48:01,407 --> 00:48:02,276
Shh.

910
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:05,664
(camera clicks)

911
00:48:05,664 --> 00:48:09,408
(soft instrumental music)

912
00:48:09,408 --> 00:48:11,313
Now I've lost him.

913
00:48:11,313 --> 00:48:15,049
(tense instrumental music)

914
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:29,276
- Have you seen a boy and two men pass

915
00:48:29,276 --> 00:48:30,841
this way?
- Dianne.

916
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:34,287
- Yes, as a matter of
fact, just awhile ago.

917
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:35,220
Anything wrong?

918
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,332
- No, my brother's up in the mountains.

919
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:39,298
He said he'd call me from here.

920
00:48:39,298 --> 00:48:40,498
- What is the name?

921
00:48:40,498 --> 00:48:42,466
- Cordeaux, Alex Cordeaux.

922
00:48:42,466 --> 00:48:44,200
- Yes, they came through this morning.

923
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,913
They said they were gonna
follow the river down.

924
00:48:45,913 --> 00:48:47,151
Anything urgent?

925
00:48:47,151 --> 00:48:50,426
- No, no, it's just a family thing.

926
00:48:50,426 --> 00:48:51,544
- Well, maybe I can help.

927
00:48:51,544 --> 00:48:52,948
It's a long way up those trails,

928
00:48:52,948 --> 00:48:54,447
and it's gonna be night soon.

929
00:48:54,447 --> 00:48:56,533
- We'll, we'll find 'em.

930
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,979
- Your boy's gonna be okay.

931
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,224
(tense music)
- Dianne.

932
00:49:02,224 --> 00:49:05,613
(tense rhythmic music)

933
00:49:21,294 --> 00:49:25,940
(ducks quack)
(urine trickles)

934
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,629
- That'll do, kid.

935
00:49:27,629 --> 00:49:30,649
- [Billy] Give me a break.

936
00:49:30,649 --> 00:49:32,648
- That was a joke, kid.

937
00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:36,534
- They can't be too much further.

938
00:49:36,534 --> 00:49:38,098
- God, I hope not.

939
00:49:39,532 --> 00:49:41,254
- Hey, kid,

940
00:49:41,254 --> 00:49:44,903
your father ever take you up here campin'?

941
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:48,813
Hey, kid, I'm talkin' to you.

942
00:49:48,813 --> 00:49:53,060
Your father ever teach you any manners?

943
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:57,027
- My father never had
time to teach my anything.

944
00:49:57,027 --> 00:50:00,775
- Good, then you won't mind
if we have to shoot him then.

945
00:50:00,775 --> 00:50:02,712
- It'll be up here soon.

946
00:50:02,712 --> 00:50:05,318
(tense music)

947
00:50:07,278 --> 00:50:09,919
Oh, there's dinner, Caine.

948
00:50:09,919 --> 00:50:12,700
(camera clicks)

949
00:50:13,618 --> 00:50:15,269
Give me the camera.

950
00:50:16,642 --> 00:50:19,050
Ah, I was only joking.

951
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,227
Come on.

952
00:50:20,227 --> 00:50:23,963
(tense instrumental music)

953
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:33,892
There he is, get down, Caine, down.

954
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,058
(gun bangs)

955
00:50:38,058 --> 00:50:38,927
- Bingo.

956
00:50:39,926 --> 00:50:41,164
- Walking?

957
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:42,730
- Walking.

958
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:46,119
(tense rhythmic music)

959
00:50:56,837 --> 00:50:58,123
- They've gone.

960
00:50:58,123 --> 00:51:00,001
- No shit, Muriel.

961
00:51:00,001 --> 00:51:01,312
- We're never gonna find 'em.

962
00:51:01,312 --> 00:51:02,673
- Oh, we'll find them.

963
00:51:02,673 --> 00:51:05,025
- Alex and Caine are
probably dead right now.

964
00:51:05,025 --> 00:51:06,179
Billy with them.

965
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:08,789
- They're alive, and we'll find them.

966
00:51:08,789 --> 00:51:10,474
- It'll be dark soon.

967
00:51:10,474 --> 00:51:12,586
- Just once in your life, Davey-Joe,

968
00:51:12,586 --> 00:51:16,235
you are gonna follow through on something!

969
00:51:18,472 --> 00:51:21,854
- (sighs) Dizzy female.

970
00:51:21,854 --> 00:51:23,905
- He's right, this is useless.

971
00:51:23,905 --> 00:51:25,602
- We are going to find them.

972
00:51:25,602 --> 00:51:26,819
They're alive.

973
00:51:28,081 --> 00:51:31,384
Let me hear it, Dianne, they're alive.

974
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,370
- They're alive.

975
00:51:35,311 --> 00:51:38,979
(gentle instrumental music)

976
00:51:38,979 --> 00:51:42,193
- Yeah, he tried to outfox us, Caine,

977
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,170
but we won the hop.

978
00:51:47,947 --> 00:51:50,728
(camera clicks)

979
00:51:51,655 --> 00:51:55,512
(gentle instrumental music)

980
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:58,987
Lucky we did, would've been baked beans.

981
00:51:59,935 --> 00:52:03,671
(tense instrumental music)

982
00:52:18,005 --> 00:52:20,091
(yawns)

983
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:25,369
After we have something to
eat, we might have a nap.

984
00:52:25,369 --> 00:52:29,105
(tense instrumental music)

985
00:52:41,189 --> 00:52:43,882
(birds squawk)

986
00:52:45,446 --> 00:52:48,049
- I'd feel a lot safer
if I had the gun, Muriel!

987
00:52:48,049 --> 00:52:50,612
- [Muriel] Oh, come on, Davey.

988
00:52:50,612 --> 00:52:54,001
(tense rhythmic music)

989
00:52:59,326 --> 00:53:02,262
- Ah, watch the hole, Conrad.

990
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,772
- Oh, thanks.

991
00:53:03,772 --> 00:53:07,161
(tense rhythmic music)

992
00:53:10,822 --> 00:53:13,515
(birds squawk)

993
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,481
(groans)

994
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:34,349
G'day.

995
00:53:35,293 --> 00:53:37,567
Where's the stone?

996
00:53:37,567 --> 00:53:39,590
- Billy, Billy, what are you doing here?

997
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:41,148
- We ask the questions.
(yells)

998
00:53:41,148 --> 00:53:43,499
Where's the stone?

999
00:53:43,499 --> 00:53:44,563
- What stone?

1000
00:53:44,563 --> 00:53:46,561
- Which one's the mute?

1001
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,429
You, tell us?

1002
00:53:51,026 --> 00:53:52,351
- He doesn't speak.

1003
00:53:52,351 --> 00:53:53,362
- Oh, he's the mute.

1004
00:53:53,362 --> 00:53:55,437
Listen, man, we don't wanna hurt ya.

1005
00:53:55,437 --> 00:53:57,096
Your brother Davey took
somethin' that belonged to us.

1006
00:53:57,096 --> 00:53:58,717
He said the dummy here's got it.

1007
00:53:58,717 --> 00:54:00,339
Where is the stone?

1008
00:54:00,339 --> 00:54:02,234
- I'm telling you the truth, I. (groans)

1009
00:54:02,234 --> 00:54:04,375
- You know, I think the
whole family's in on it.

1010
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:06,552
I think they're a bunch
of lyin', thievin',

1011
00:54:06,552 --> 00:54:07,654
I'm gonna kill this kid.

1012
00:54:07,654 --> 00:54:08,523
- No.

1013
00:54:08,523 --> 00:54:10,643
- Last chance, man, where's the stone?

1014
00:54:10,643 --> 00:54:11,874
One!

1015
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:12,743
Two.

1016
00:54:12,743 --> 00:54:13,914
- No, don't hurt the kid, man.

1017
00:54:13,914 --> 00:54:15,618
- What?
(yells)

1018
00:54:15,618 --> 00:54:17,054
(camera clicks)

1019
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:20,713
(dramatic instrumental music)

1020
00:54:20,713 --> 00:54:22,348
Come on, after 'em!

1021
00:54:22,348 --> 00:54:25,998
(dramatic rhythmic music)

1022
00:54:28,058 --> 00:54:28,985
Go on!

1023
00:54:28,985 --> 00:54:32,635
(dramatic rhythmic music)

1024
00:54:33,955 --> 00:54:35,053
Come on, man.

1025
00:54:35,053 --> 00:54:39,398
- (coughs) I've got an incredibly
bad feeling about this.

1026
00:54:41,009 --> 00:54:44,753
- I'll give you a funny
feeling right up your,

1027
00:54:44,753 --> 00:54:46,233
come on, man.

1028
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:48,086
If we don't get that
stone, I'll eat the fire.

1029
00:54:48,086 --> 00:54:49,779
Now, come on!

1030
00:54:49,779 --> 00:54:51,463
- You all right, Billy?

1031
00:54:51,463 --> 00:54:52,508
- I'm okay.

1032
00:54:52,508 --> 00:54:54,366
- Who are those guys?

1033
00:54:54,366 --> 00:54:55,860
- They came to the house.

1034
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:56,729
- They what?

1035
00:54:56,729 --> 00:54:58,762
- Had Davey-Joe and Muriel were with them.

1036
00:54:58,762 --> 00:54:59,672
- Muriel?

1037
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:01,037
- They held us down.

1038
00:55:01,037 --> 00:55:03,639
Somehow, Muriel got the
better of one of them.

1039
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:05,086
She stabbed him.

1040
00:55:05,086 --> 00:55:07,663
They grabbed me and they came
out here looking for Caine.

1041
00:55:07,663 --> 00:55:09,842
- What about your mother?

1042
00:55:09,842 --> 00:55:11,337
- They didn't touch her.

1043
00:55:11,337 --> 00:55:12,919
- Thank God for that.

1044
00:55:12,919 --> 00:55:15,636
(thudding)
So whatever mess Davey, shh.

1045
00:55:15,636 --> 00:55:18,032
Now, what's wrong?

1046
00:55:18,032 --> 00:55:19,584
Ah, the badge.

1047
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:20,452
- What badge?

1048
00:55:20,452 --> 00:55:21,913
- Oh, the ranger gave him a badge.

1049
00:55:21,913 --> 00:55:23,271
Look, don't worry about the badge.

1050
00:55:23,271 --> 00:55:25,193
We'll get you another one.

1051
00:55:25,193 --> 00:55:27,355
Now, come on, that way, quick.

1052
00:55:27,355 --> 00:55:28,525
Come on, Caine.

1053
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:29,828
Caine, come on.

1054
00:55:33,566 --> 00:55:37,911
(birds squawk)
(tense music)

1055
00:55:43,451 --> 00:55:45,803
- Damn, we lost 'em!

1056
00:55:45,803 --> 00:55:47,207
- I really don't care.

1057
00:55:47,207 --> 00:55:48,115
- You don't care?

1058
00:55:48,115 --> 00:55:50,542
- I really don't care.

1059
00:55:50,542 --> 00:55:51,410
- Conrad,

1060
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:55,203
you all right, man?

1061
00:55:55,203 --> 00:55:57,113
- I have a really,

1062
00:55:57,113 --> 00:55:59,260
really, really--
- Really bad feeling.

1063
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,303
- That's it.

1064
00:56:03,913 --> 00:56:05,130
- Conrad, man,

1065
00:56:06,083 --> 00:56:07,473
get it together.

1066
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:12,768
We've been through worse than this, man.

1067
00:56:12,768 --> 00:56:13,637
Remember?

1068
00:56:15,008 --> 00:56:16,508
- Oh, yeah.

1069
00:56:16,508 --> 00:56:17,525
- Remember?

1070
00:56:17,525 --> 00:56:18,624
- I remember.

1071
00:56:18,624 --> 00:56:20,970
(laughing)

1072
00:56:30,401 --> 00:56:33,877
(gentle mystical music)

1073
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:44,111
- Hey, we can't stop now.

1074
00:56:44,111 --> 00:56:45,443
- I'm staying here.

1075
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,367
- Great, I'm into it.

1076
00:56:47,367 --> 00:56:51,191
(gentle instrumental music)

1077
00:56:56,975 --> 00:57:00,364
(tense rhythmic music)

1078
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:18,644
- [Billy] I didn't know
anyone lived up here.

1079
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:19,651
- Neither did I.

1080
00:57:19,651 --> 00:57:22,605
You two stay here, and I'll check.

1081
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,127
(tense music)

1082
00:57:50,403 --> 00:57:53,044
(insects chirp)

1083
00:57:53,044 --> 00:57:55,651
(tense music)

1084
00:58:12,298 --> 00:58:13,620
It's empty.

1085
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:16,571
Well, stay here the night and
get our bearings fixed up.

1086
00:58:16,571 --> 00:58:18,920
Go down the mountain in the morning.

1087
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:19,789
Come on.

1088
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,664
Caine, come on.

1089
00:58:22,664 --> 00:58:26,400
(tense instrumental music)

1090
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:51,853
- Sole,

1091
00:58:53,819 --> 00:58:57,067
you know how much I hate jails, don't ya?

1092
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:59,003
- Yeah, man, I know.

1093
00:58:59,003 --> 00:59:01,696
- Well, if I ever get real bad,

1094
00:59:04,859 --> 00:59:06,336
you'll finish it,

1095
00:59:08,542 --> 00:59:09,410
won't ya?

1096
00:59:12,527 --> 00:59:15,533
- Yeah, man, I'll pop ya
off, don't worry about it.

1097
00:59:15,533 --> 00:59:17,011
- You promise me?

1098
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:19,306
Finish it.

1099
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:22,318
- Yeah, man, I told ya I'd do it.

1100
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:25,011
(solemn music)

1101
00:59:26,122 --> 00:59:29,284
(chuckles)

1102
00:59:29,284 --> 00:59:32,316
(solemn music)

1103
00:59:32,316 --> 00:59:34,354
- I've gonna have some sleep.

1104
00:59:34,354 --> 00:59:36,979
- Yeah, you go rest, man.

1105
00:59:36,979 --> 00:59:38,249
- Sure.

1106
00:59:38,249 --> 00:59:42,072
(solemn instrumental music)

1107
00:59:48,804 --> 00:59:51,932
(tense eerie music)

1108
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:05,617
(birds chirp)

1109
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,350
- Hey, I'm sorry about all this.

1110
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:21,153
- Well, that doesn't help
the situation, does it?

1111
01:00:21,153 --> 01:00:24,155
- Well, I feel pretty stupid
tryin' to take on these guys.

1112
01:00:24,155 --> 01:00:26,520
- That's the story of
your life, Davey-Joe.

1113
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:28,039
The next big deal,

1114
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:30,732
the next get-rick-quick scheme.

1115
01:00:46,677 --> 01:00:49,284
(birds chirp)

1116
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,002
- You're not gonna attempt
the housekeeping, are ya?

1117
01:00:59,002 --> 01:01:01,188
Mom would love this place.

1118
01:01:01,188 --> 01:01:03,274
- Clear a spot on the floor.

1119
01:01:03,274 --> 01:01:04,143
Caine,

1120
01:01:05,211 --> 01:01:08,075
come here, mate, come here.

1121
01:01:08,075 --> 01:01:10,942
You two, get some rest, in ya go.

1122
01:01:12,728 --> 01:01:14,033
I'll keep watch for a while.

1123
01:01:14,033 --> 01:01:15,666
- Dad, you need some sleep.

1124
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:17,450
- I'll be okay.

1125
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:19,361
- We could take turns.

1126
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:22,577
- Not a bad idea.

1127
01:01:22,577 --> 01:01:24,394
I'll wake you up in a couple of hours.

1128
01:01:24,394 --> 01:01:25,263
- Deal.

1129
01:02:04,647 --> 01:02:08,383
(tense instrumental music)

1130
01:02:20,848 --> 01:02:21,716
- Sole.

1131
01:02:24,827 --> 01:02:25,869
- What, man?

1132
01:02:28,058 --> 01:02:31,615
- I got a really bad feeling about this.

1133
01:02:31,615 --> 01:02:33,961
- Conrad, go to sleep, man.

1134
01:02:38,578 --> 01:02:41,359
(insects chirp)

1135
01:02:47,892 --> 01:02:50,413
(clattering)

1136
01:02:52,696 --> 01:02:53,913
- Alex, Caine!

1137
01:02:58,791 --> 01:03:01,919
(tense eerie music)

1138
01:03:36,224 --> 01:03:37,730
- [Billy] Dad,

1139
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,904
what happened to Caine?

1140
01:03:39,904 --> 01:03:40,772
- Hmm?

1141
01:03:42,609 --> 01:03:43,825
The way he is?

1142
01:03:49,472 --> 01:03:51,383
It's from an accident.

1143
01:03:53,201 --> 01:03:54,940
A long time ago now.

1144
01:03:55,982 --> 01:03:59,046
He was mooring out from the shore.

1145
01:03:59,046 --> 01:04:02,315
We should've known better,
there was signs all around

1146
01:04:02,315 --> 01:04:05,529
saying how dangerous the current was.

1147
01:04:06,762 --> 01:04:07,630
We swam,

1148
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:11,877
and when we got to the mooring,

1149
01:04:11,877 --> 01:04:13,799
there were only four of us.

1150
01:04:13,799 --> 01:04:15,277
No sign of Caine.

1151
01:04:17,419 --> 01:04:20,186
He was on the bottom with
about six feet of water,

1152
01:04:20,186 --> 01:04:22,532
trapped in the kelp, weeds.

1153
01:04:24,056 --> 01:04:28,739
When we got him to the
surface, he was unconscious.

1154
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,738
Well, they revived him,

1155
01:04:31,706 --> 01:04:34,545
but due to the lack of oxygen,

1156
01:04:34,545 --> 01:04:37,673
the brain, he suffered brain damage.

1157
01:04:38,609 --> 01:04:42,133
He never spoke another word from that day,

1158
01:04:42,133 --> 01:04:43,089
not a word.

1159
01:04:45,369 --> 01:04:47,976
(birds chirp)

1160
01:04:57,141 --> 01:04:58,776
- Hey, Conrad, come on.

1161
01:04:58,776 --> 01:05:01,566
Come on, man, let's get
on the case, come on.

1162
01:05:01,566 --> 01:05:03,390
Come on, we gotta go.

1163
01:05:04,453 --> 01:05:08,516
Hey, man, why'd you let
that bitch stab you?

1164
01:05:08,516 --> 01:05:10,915
- 'Cause I thought it was a
really great idea at the time.

1165
01:05:10,915 --> 01:05:12,821
- You're bent, you know
that, you're bent, man.

1166
01:05:12,821 --> 01:05:15,488
- Well, I've had a really
great teacher, haven't I?

1167
01:05:15,488 --> 01:05:18,076
- (chuckles) Come on,
we need that stone, man.

1168
01:05:18,076 --> 01:05:18,944
Come on.

1169
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:23,149
(tense music)

1170
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:35,565
- Caine?

1171
01:05:36,444 --> 01:05:37,464
Billy!

1172
01:05:37,464 --> 01:05:40,247
- I-I'll take over the watch now, Dad.

1173
01:05:40,247 --> 01:05:41,963
- It's morning, I fell asleep.

1174
01:05:41,963 --> 01:05:43,990
Where's Caine?

1175
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:46,928
- Well, he was just over there.

1176
01:05:46,928 --> 01:05:48,422
- The badge.

1177
01:05:48,422 --> 01:05:50,196
Oh, he wouldn't be that stupid.

1178
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:51,979
- That stupid, what do
you think he's done?

1179
01:05:51,979 --> 01:05:55,398
- The badge, you know how small
things take over his mind.

1180
01:05:55,398 --> 01:05:57,194
- You don't think he's
gone out looking for it?

1181
01:05:57,194 --> 01:05:58,756
- Well, it's the only explanation.

1182
01:05:58,756 --> 01:06:00,900
Why else would he walk off?

1183
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:03,507
(tense music)

1184
01:06:11,774 --> 01:06:12,643
- Gone.

1185
01:06:14,115 --> 01:06:17,255
I'm ashamed to say he's my brother.

1186
01:06:17,255 --> 01:06:19,340
We've got to find Billy.

1187
01:06:20,686 --> 01:06:22,598
- Davey's got the gun.

1188
01:06:25,727 --> 01:06:29,937
I think we should go back to the ranger.

1189
01:06:29,937 --> 01:06:32,664
- Looks like our only option.

1190
01:06:32,664 --> 01:06:36,400
(tense instrumental music)

1191
01:07:04,524 --> 01:07:06,281
- [Billy] I can't see anyone.

1192
01:07:06,281 --> 01:07:08,159
- Doesn't mean to say
they're not out there.

1193
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,981
- We can't just stay here.

1194
01:07:09,981 --> 01:07:11,458
What about Caine?

1195
01:07:13,944 --> 01:07:14,812
- Muriel!

1196
01:07:15,705 --> 01:07:16,574
Muriel!

1197
01:07:18,141 --> 01:07:19,705
Here!

1198
01:07:19,705 --> 01:07:22,156
- What are you doing up there?

1199
01:07:22,156 --> 01:07:23,625
- I went looking for Alex and Caine.

1200
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:25,351
Somebody hit me on the head.

1201
01:07:25,351 --> 01:07:27,144
I woke up here.

1202
01:07:27,144 --> 01:07:28,553
- How'd you get up there?

1203
01:07:28,553 --> 01:07:30,565
- [Davey] I don't know.

1204
01:07:30,565 --> 01:07:33,240
- [Muriel] Well, come on down.

1205
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,109
- I can't.

1206
01:07:35,069 --> 01:07:37,676
(tense music)

1207
01:07:44,808 --> 01:07:47,762
(leaves rustling)

1208
01:07:51,112 --> 01:07:53,719
(tense music)

1209
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:03,492
(chuckling)

1210
01:08:04,503 --> 01:08:06,021
- Together again.

1211
01:08:06,021 --> 01:08:07,708
Where's the dummy?

1212
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,944
- He's wandered off, we're searching.

1213
01:08:09,944 --> 01:08:12,507
- Come on, man, you can
do better than that.

1214
01:08:12,507 --> 01:08:13,375
- Dad.

1215
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:14,244
- No, I.

1216
01:08:14,244 --> 01:08:16,534
(smacking)
- Where is he, Where is he?

1217
01:08:16,534 --> 01:08:17,825
Where is he?

1218
01:08:17,825 --> 01:08:19,309
- He's lost.

1219
01:08:19,309 --> 01:08:20,301
- Do him.

1220
01:08:20,301 --> 01:08:23,230
(tense music)

1221
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:24,633
(groans)

1222
01:08:24,633 --> 01:08:26,963
- [Alex] Run, Billy!

1223
01:08:26,963 --> 01:08:28,466
(groaning)

1224
01:08:28,466 --> 01:08:31,178
- [Sole] I'm gonna go after them!

1225
01:08:31,178 --> 01:08:33,524
(groaning)

1226
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:37,418
(tense music)

1227
01:08:39,593 --> 01:08:41,211
- Jesus!

1228
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:43,818
(tense music)

1229
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:48,238
- Damn!

1230
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:50,769
Damn, damn, damn!

1231
01:08:51,817 --> 01:08:54,424
(tense music)

1232
01:08:55,553 --> 01:08:56,731
- Dad, who is it?

1233
01:08:56,731 --> 01:09:00,076
- I don't know, but they're a good shot?

1234
01:09:00,076 --> 01:09:02,683
(tense music)

1235
01:09:04,436 --> 01:09:06,695
(roaring)

1236
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,926
(rumbling)

1237
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:33,085
(tense music)
(birds squawk)

1238
01:09:39,079 --> 01:09:41,493
- What the hell's goin' on?

1239
01:09:41,493 --> 01:09:44,100
(tense music)

1240
01:10:08,026 --> 01:10:10,001
You all right?

1241
01:10:10,001 --> 01:10:11,652
- I don't think so.

1242
01:10:13,044 --> 01:10:15,317
- Stay here, man, I'm
gonna check this out.

1243
01:10:15,317 --> 01:10:17,451
- Sure, I'm not,

1244
01:10:17,451 --> 01:10:20,405
I'm definitely not going anywhere.

1245
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:30,205
(tense music)

1246
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:48,949
(thudding)

1247
01:10:48,949 --> 01:10:52,338
(tense mystical music)

1248
01:11:10,742 --> 01:11:14,409
- I know what they got planned,
but it ain't gonna work.

1249
01:11:14,409 --> 01:11:17,798
(tense mystical music)

1250
01:11:24,721 --> 01:11:26,104
Yo, Conrad!

1251
01:11:26,104 --> 01:11:28,858
Up here, I got the dummy!

1252
01:11:28,858 --> 01:11:29,727
- I can't!

1253
01:11:32,941 --> 01:11:34,614
I just can't.

1254
01:11:34,614 --> 01:11:37,118
(tense mystical music)

1255
01:11:37,118 --> 01:11:38,422
- It's useless.

1256
01:11:40,451 --> 01:11:42,245
Where's the bag?

1257
01:11:42,245 --> 01:11:45,634
(tense mystical music)

1258
01:11:46,557 --> 01:11:48,903
The bag you left home with.

1259
01:11:50,453 --> 01:11:52,079
Where is it?

1260
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:55,468
(tense mystical music)

1261
01:11:57,927 --> 01:11:59,388
Come on.

1262
01:11:59,388 --> 01:12:02,776
(tense mystical music)

1263
01:12:04,675 --> 01:12:05,544
Come on.

1264
01:12:08,521 --> 01:12:10,953
(swooshing)

1265
01:12:18,013 --> 01:12:21,401
(tense mystical music)

1266
01:12:29,236 --> 01:12:31,061
Come on, man, get up!

1267
01:12:33,269 --> 01:12:34,138
- Sure.

1268
01:12:37,205 --> 01:12:40,258
- I want you on your feet!

1269
01:12:40,258 --> 01:12:41,126
- Fantasy.

1270
01:12:42,331 --> 01:12:43,460
Pure fantasy.

1271
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:45,855
(chuckles)

1272
01:12:45,855 --> 01:12:48,027
(coughs)

1273
01:12:55,995 --> 01:12:58,602
(tense music)

1274
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:06,067
(gun bangs)

1275
01:13:06,067 --> 01:13:08,743
(tense music)

1276
01:13:08,743 --> 01:13:10,276
- Billy!

1277
01:13:10,276 --> 01:13:13,665
(tense mystical music)

1278
01:13:31,597 --> 01:13:34,377
(fire crackles)

1279
01:13:35,973 --> 01:13:37,896
- [Davey] I'll drive ya
to the ranger's station.

1280
01:13:37,896 --> 01:13:39,759
You can call the cops from there.

1281
01:13:39,759 --> 01:13:41,880
I'll take my own chances.

1282
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:44,484
You can forget you ever had a brother.

1283
01:13:44,484 --> 01:13:46,906
- It's a bit late for that now.

1284
01:13:46,906 --> 01:13:49,947
- Just get to the ranger's station.

1285
01:13:51,897 --> 01:13:54,918
- I wonder how I got up that tree.

1286
01:13:54,918 --> 01:13:58,220
(slow mystical music)

1287
01:14:08,839 --> 01:14:10,434
- Come on!

1288
01:14:10,434 --> 01:14:11,998
What's the matter?

1289
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:15,811
It's around here, isn't it?

1290
01:14:15,811 --> 01:14:17,458
Where's the stone?

1291
01:14:17,458 --> 01:14:20,065
(tense music)

1292
01:14:31,348 --> 01:14:32,867
Where's the stone?

1293
01:14:32,867 --> 01:14:34,364
Where is it?

1294
01:14:34,364 --> 01:14:35,758
Where is it?

1295
01:14:35,758 --> 01:14:39,146

1296
01:14:44,649 --> 01:14:46,747

1297
01:14:46,747 --> 01:14:47,615
Come on!

1298
01:14:51,194 --> 01:14:53,459
Where, where is it?

1299
01:14:53,459 --> 01:14:56,239
(soft tinkling)

1300
01:15:04,715 --> 01:15:05,583
Good boy.

1301
01:15:06,649 --> 01:15:09,951
(soft mystical music)

1302
01:15:28,058 --> 01:15:30,392
- [Davey] What the hell is goin on, Mure?

1303
01:15:30,392 --> 01:15:32,017
This is the place, isn't it?

1304
01:15:32,017 --> 01:15:33,889
(tense music)

1305
01:15:33,889 --> 01:15:36,453
(rumbling)

1306
01:15:36,453 --> 01:15:38,590
(chuckling)

1307
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:40,034
- Kid, I love ya!

1308
01:15:40,034 --> 01:15:42,387
(chuckles)

1309
01:15:42,387 --> 01:15:44,236

01:15:45,681 --> 01:15:48,548
(dramatic music)

1312
01:16:01,993 --> 01:16:04,403
- What's happening?

1313
01:16:04,403 --> 01:16:08,748
(gun bangs)
(tense music)

1314
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:15,086
(yells)

1315
01:16:16,033 --> 01:16:17,076
- It's okay.

1316
01:16:18,066 --> 01:16:19,577
- Dianne?

1317
01:16:19,577 --> 01:16:22,966
(tense mystical music)

1318
01:16:52,701 --> 01:16:54,033
Dianne!

1319
01:16:54,033 --> 01:16:56,379

(soft mystical music)

1327
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:40,335
- What happened here?

1328
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:46,673
(bird squawks)

1329
01:19:54,421 --> 01:19:57,288
(engine rumbles)

1330
01:20:00,259 --> 01:20:01,154

1331
01:20:01,154 --> 01:20:02,022
- Where's Dianne?

1332
01:20:02,022 --> 01:20:03,435
- Caine, you all right?

1333
01:20:03,435 --> 01:20:04,776
- Where's Dianne?

1334
01:20:04,776 --> 01:20:06,666
- Oh, she's in the cabin, or the ranger's,

1335
01:20:06,666 --> 01:20:08,020
or whatever the hell you call it.

1336
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:11,289
I don't know what's going on.

1337
01:20:11,289 --> 01:20:12,940
She won't come out.

1338
01:20:15,261 --> 01:20:17,085
- You're in the shit.

1339
01:20:19,516 --> 01:20:21,354
- Thought I might be.

1340
01:20:21,354 --> 01:20:22,837
- They didn't hurt you, did they?

1341
01:20:22,837 --> 01:20:26,052
- No, except they wouldn't
let me wee for three hours.

1342
01:20:26,052 --> 01:20:28,543
(chuckles)

1343
01:20:28,543 --> 01:20:29,411
- Caine.

1344
01:20:40,033 --> 01:20:41,587
- You okay?

1345
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:43,064
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1346
01:20:44,516 --> 01:20:46,248
- What happened?

1347
01:20:46,248 --> 01:20:47,551
- I don't know.

1348
01:20:48,915 --> 01:20:51,491
Do you remember when we
used to come camping here?

1349
01:20:51,491 --> 01:20:53,514
This was just an old ranger station,

1350
01:20:53,514 --> 01:20:55,854
hadn't been used for years.

1351
01:20:55,854 --> 01:20:57,447
Yesterday, when I.

1352
01:20:57,447 --> 01:21:01,517
- I made a phone call from here yesterday.

1353
01:21:01,517 --> 01:21:02,561
- Are you sure?

1354
01:21:02,561 --> 01:21:04,696
- Yeah, the phone was,

1355
01:21:04,696 --> 01:21:06,868
the phone was over there.

1356
01:21:16,015 --> 01:21:17,858
You know, something happened to Caine

1357
01:21:17,858 --> 01:21:19,355
up on that mountain, too.

1358
01:21:19,355 --> 01:21:20,349
- Caine, what?

1359
01:21:20,349 --> 01:21:24,721
- I don't know, something
strange, I don't know what.

1360

police when they noticed blood

1366
01:23:15,034 --> 01:23:16,450
on the passenger seat.

1367
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:18,851
The police searched the area
and subsequently arrested a man

1368
01:23:18,851 --> 01:23:20,825
in connection with the mystery.

1369
01:23:20,825 --> 01:23:23,727
Davey-Joe Cordeaux told
police he last saw Sole

1370
01:23:23,727 --> 01:23:25,535
en route to Sher Mountain Park

1371
01:23:25,535 --> 01:23:27,535
and knows nothing about the incident.

1372
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:29,911
Charges against Cordeaux
are expected to be laid

1373
01:23:29,911 --> 01:23:33,317

have the magic word.

1377
01:23:39,457 --> 01:23:41,405
- [Cartoon] Then go find it.

1378
01:23:41,405 --> 01:23:42,860
- [Cartoon] But how?

1379
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:46,656
- [Cartoon] You'll take a
magic boat and search for it.

1380
01:23:46,656 --> 01:23:47,611
- Where?

1381
01:23:47,611 --> 01:23:49,547
- [Cartoon] In the ocean.

1382
01:23:49,547 --> 01:23:51,694
- [Cartoon] In the ocean, why?

1383
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:53,367
- [Cartoon] Because it's such a big place,

1384
01:23:53,367 --> 01:23:56,187
we're bound to find it there.
