1
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,359
<i>In Hamburg, the population</i>
<i>is preparing for massive flooding.</i>

2
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:40,039
<i>Similar situations in Great Britain,</i>
<i>Greece and in Russia.</i>

3
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:44,840
<i>An anticyclone approaching the</i>
<i>Azores archipelago on the Atlantic.</i>

4
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,759
<i>Low pressure systems and</i>
<i>high-altitude cold air pockets...</i>

5
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,759
To my two sons

6
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,759
<i>A local phenomenon,</i>
<i>yet weather is unstable everywhere.</i>

7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,320
Artic temperatures in Peru...

8
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,760
Hi, Didier.

9
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,599
- What's he doing?
- Get lost!

10
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,799
We said move it!

11
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,919
On the rag again, Lecurse?

12
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,520
Love you, I'm on my way.

13
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,479
I promise I'll tell them.

14
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,800
Well?

15
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,759
I came to tell you...

16
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes?

17
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,439
Antoine!

18
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,479
Water, please.

19
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,080
I can't get it up.

20
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,120
Laetitia, I didn't see you.

21
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,759
- Hi, Boss.
- One sec.

22
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,000
What's this I hear? Matthieu's agent
said he never got the contracts.

23
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,919
Did you send them?

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,879
Get on it! Now!
I want a delivery boy.

25
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,639
Sorry, doc.
I'm paralyzed with fear.

26
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:59,599
I'm afraid to sleep with my wife.
I invent migraines!

27
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,360
- I can't do cunni forever!
- Excuse me?

28
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,400
Cunnilingus!

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,960
What's the deal,
now you're eavesdropping?

30
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,840
I'm afraid she'll catch on.
If she does, I'm dead.

31
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,120
We argue nonstop
when we fuck, so if we don't...

32
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,000
It's all over.

33
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,159
Ivan Lenoire
Illegitimate & Illicit

34
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,800
Coming!

35
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:43,680
Ivan Lenoire?

36
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:49,080
- Yes.
- Fanny Galice, officer of justice.

37
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,639
Justice...
I love justice.

38
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,479
- Go on, men.
- Take it all!

39
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,960
Suits me fine.

40
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,879
Here.
That's done.

41
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,800
There you go.
Make yourselves at home.

42
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,599
Dad?

43
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,160
When did you wash last?

44
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,279
Why bother?

45
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,680
Excuse me, Mrs. Lecomte.

46
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,519
I'll only be a minute.

47
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,480
Don't worry, just a bit of fever.

48
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,199
- Think your mom could babysit?
- I can't ask another favor.

49
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:59,480
I know, but I had 3 massages
and we're broke.

50
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,480
<i>- Sorry.</i>
<i>- Okay, I'll manage.</i>

51
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,839
I'll let you go.

52
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,199
Love you.

53
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,720
Watch out!

54
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you crazy?
Look before you pull out!

55
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,199
You ride like that with a baby?

56
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,360
You guys think you own the road!
Get rid of the bike!

57
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,439
Get rid of the bike?

58
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,959
Okay, I'll get rid of the bike!

59
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,480
Look, I'm getting rid of it! Fuck!
It's gone!

60
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,360
Look, it's gone! Look!

61
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,360
Stop. Stop it!
Be quiet, shit!

62
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,519
- Camille?
- The wedding?

63
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,480
- I'm leaving you.
- Don't.

64
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,079
<i>Can we back-pedal...</i>
<i>Month end...</i>

65
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,199
<i>- End of world...</i>
<i>- New cases...</i>

66
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,720
<i>Hundreds of elephants</i>
<i>found dead...</i>

67
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,079
Mister, what's going on?

68
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:58,480
Message No. 4 is a little smiley
blowing a kiss.

69
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,680
What's that mean?
A peck on the cheek? I still love you?

70
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,959
It could be anything.
I hate that smiley.

71
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,240
Yes!
Yes!

72
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,399
My man!

73
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,680
Hello, gentlemen.

74
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,120
Hello.
Welcome.

75
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,879
- Thank you.
- First off, there's a form to sign.

76
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,120
Here.

77
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,879
- A simple pact.
- What kind of form?

78
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,560
I'll answer your questions afterwards.

79
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,959
- Sorry for the inconvenience.
- Thanks.

80
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,680
But I have no choice.

81
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,480
- Who needs a pen?
- Me.

82
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,680
Did you have a nice trip?

83
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,079
In my field,
"pact" means "confidentiality clause."

84
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,120
Noncompliance means jail.

85
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
What happens here stays here.

86
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,879
Who are you anyhow?
Where's the coach?

87
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,480
For the record,
next train is tomorrow evening.

88
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,399
- May I?
- Help yourself.

89
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,360
- Thank you.
- Can I borrow your back too?

90
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,480
I hope it's not a sect.

91
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,160
Here.
Children can participate too?

92
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,959
- I thought it was men only.
- Fuck you, I'm 18.

93
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,319
I think he answered you.

94
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,399
I'll take my pens back.

95
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,839
Perfect. We can go.

96
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,559
- Ma'am, are you parked far?
- Sorry, I don't have a car.

97
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,200
I don't even drive.

98
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,919
So we're walking? Is it far?

99
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,159
- I hope you have raincoats.
- The exit's back there.

100
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,120
MEN ON THE VERGE
OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN

101
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,159
Only one horse?

102
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Hey, kid.

103
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,759
Kid!

104
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,519
Wait a sec. Hang on.

105
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,960
Look, I'll give you 20 euros
to carry my suitcase.

106
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,399
Forty.

107
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,559
You drive a hard deal.

108
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,919
Here, you owe me ten.

109
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,480
And we walk behind like dumb slaves.

110
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,799
You said it.

111
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,399
- You noticed too?
- Yeah.

112
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,279
- They said no phones.
- I'm putting it away.

113
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,799
Hello, sweetheart.

114
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,919
Goddamn.

115
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,480
Hello, sweetheart.
First day in the woods.

116
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,000
The adventure is starting.
I already feel like a new man.

117
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:50,799
Call me back
whenever you like, I'm free.

118
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,240
Otherwise, I'll call you. Love you.

119
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,600
Love?

120
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,480
- Can I bum a cig?
- Sorry, I stopped smoking.

121
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,399
You've got a cigarette in your mouth.

122
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,000
Reminds me of my scout days.
Summer camp.

123
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,720
- Not in the water!
- I don't want wet shoes.

124
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:21,799
Shit!

125
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,840
No way, shit.

126
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,080
What do you think?

127
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,000
Can you just throw
15 years as a couple out the window?

128
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,080
I'm the wrong person to ask.

129
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,200
It smells nice here.

130
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:43,080
What do you call "not far"?

131
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:45,480
We've come halfway.

132
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,399
Halfway? You're joking, right?

133
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,600
It's been two hours.
You have a horse!

134
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,799
I came here to relax, not die.
I'm out of here!

135
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,159
You'll never find the way.

136
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,200
Goodbye, losers.

137
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:09,960
We can't leave him alone,
he'll get lost. He's old.

138
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:12,759
He'll be back in exactly
five seconds.

139
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:21,120
Fucking hell!
There's a wolf! I saw a wolf!

140
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,679
- A wolf's coming!
- A wolf?

141
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,919
- It was right there.
- Cool.

142
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,639
Careful, this is their turf.

143
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,840
Stay in a group and they won't attack.

144
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,240
Maybe there's a pack. Hey scout...

145
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,879
Get behind,
your backpack will protect you.

146
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,879
No problem... I'll bring up the rear.

147
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,000
- Yeah, that's it.
- Good luck.

148
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,159
It came right out in the open.

149
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,360
It stared me in the eye.

150
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,279
- Did it charge?
- No, it crossed the path.

151
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,320
Fuck.
It crossed the path.

152
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,000
Hot, cold, hot, cold...

153
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,759
We'll catch our death.

154
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,360
Excuse me!
Is the coach waiting for us?

155
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,159
Coach, doctor, shrink...

156
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,960
- I'm Coach Omega.
- What?

157
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,720
Pleased to meet you.

158
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,559
You should see your faces.

159
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,600
I myself don't mind...

160
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,480
but others might.

161
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:28,840
That's true.

162
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,240
You don't talk
the same way to a man.

163
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,240
I don't get it, did I miss something?

164
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,360
Omega is a woman.

165
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,559
I signed up for a men only workshop.

166
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,120
I don't need a chick giving me orders,
I've got my mom.

167
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,240
Who'd have come if you'd known?

168
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,440
8One.

169
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,000
Two.

170
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,759
And a half?

171
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,799
2.5 out of 7.

172
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,360
That's right.

173
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,799
Come on, let's step up the pace.

174
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,639
Step up the pace...
No cowgirl will order me around.

175
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,480
I'll damn well
walk at my own speed.

176
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,799
I don't mind

177
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,679
but it could've been more explicit.

178
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,639
A contract should be upheld.

179
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,600
Article 121 of the Consumer Code.

180
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,080
What the hell?

181
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,840
- I told you. I told you!
- We need to step up the pace.

182
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,679
Go have fun.

183
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,039
THEY'RE HAPPY

184
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,080
Here you are!

185
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,919
"They're happy"?

186
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,679
Oh, I get it.

187
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,879
- Stupid play on words.
- Here we are.

188
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,000
There's nothing.

189
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,840
- "Nothing"? Let the word resonate.
- Nothing.

190
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,720
Nothing.

191
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,159
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

192
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,080
- The air's pure.
- Follow me.

193
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,919
A slum and a trash dump.

194
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,080
The rooster
looks like my neighbor Robert!

195
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,600
You have trees.
Nature all around.

196
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,559
- And plenty of recycling material.
- Only one tent?

197
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,519
Hey, I'm hungry.

198
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,919
First you build a campsite,
then you eat.

199
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,360
We're been walking for five hours!
We're starving.

200
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,519
- Trust me.
- Oh shit! This is inhuman.

201
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,039
Be creative, inventive
and use anything you find.

202
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,440
- Let's go.
- Come on, men.

203
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,240
It's empty.

204
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,840
Terribly empty.
Frighteningly empty.

205
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:41,879
There's no signal.

206
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,559
Hang on.

207
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,559
Please.

208
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,879
- Tell me there's WiFi.
- I'm sorry, this is a black zone.

209
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,720
- No way.
- What?

210
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,840
- I have a law firm.
- I have to call my wife.

211
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,159
Please, gentlemen, a bit of humility.

212
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,080
I promise,
the world will turn without you.

213
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,200
It's only four days.
Everything's going to be fine.

214
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,879
You're right.

215
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,240
No electricity either?

216
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,639
To reconnect you must disconnect.

217
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,759
No problem, I'm already there.

218
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:25,000
It's the principle of the workshop.
Why not play along?

219
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,440
C'mon, let's be positive.

220
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,440
Isn't it nice here?
The air's pure, we're together.

221
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,600
Put the cow away, it can't stay there!

222
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:37,240
Where's the toilet?

223
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,120
- Anywhere in the nature.
- No dry toilets?

224
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,039
Dry toilets? No.
But you can build some.

225
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,440
- I'll help you.
- Let's go.

226
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,559
Place two poles vertically.

227
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,919
- I'll tie them.
- Hold on tight.

228
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,679
- Too high.
- Three men hold, one ties.

229
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:57,720
Like a hut.

230
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,679
Lay them on the ground.

231
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,600
He's right, lay them down.

232
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,840
- Like this.
- Why are you the boss?

233
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,840
It's not to sit on.

234
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,879
- Drop it.
- You got it?

235
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,840
- Two beds on either side.
- Don't wear yourself out.

236
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,799
Maybe a chamber pot?

237
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,639
No smoking in the yurt.

238
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:35,120
- It's not kindling wood, it's a base.
- A base for what?

239
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,159
Look.

240
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,399
A fire table, a BBQ.

241
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:42,320
You're making a wooden BBQ?

242
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,600
That's a great idea. Just great...

243
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,039
Not bad, guys.

244
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,799
- Not bad at all.
- Can we sit?

245
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:50,919
Not yet!

246
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,039
Are you crazy?

247
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,440
Oh fuck!
I cut myself! No, I'm fine.

248
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,879
Oh shit, yes I did!

249
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,359
You okay?

250
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:13,680
Dining room.

251
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
China closet.

252
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,920
Fire table.

253
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,880
My last cigarettes!

254
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,240
There we go.

255
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,759
A nice sink.

256
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,559
Gentlemen, we should be proud.

257
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,839
God created the world in seven days.
We only needed hours.

258
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,759
Who'd have thought?

259
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,640
What's for lunch?

260
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,079
There's a permaculture vegetable patch.

261
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,720
The plants protect each other
without pesticides.

262
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,799
Fruit trees, wild berries
and 1,500 hectares of forest.

263
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,839
I'll take a look.

264
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,079
Go on.
Go on, Michel.

265
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,319
- I'm Antoine.
- Oh sorry, Antoine.

266
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,200
A potato.

267
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:34,799
You're bleeding again?

268
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,440
I'm hungry.

269
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,240
We'll make an omelet.

270
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,960
A Spanish omelet.

271
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:45,440
With handpicked potatoes.

272
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,319
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

273
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,359
I need a drink. Wine, beer,
rubbing alcohol... anything.

274
00:18:59,039 --> 00:18:59,960
Oh shit!

275
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:06,079
Gentlemen, don't move or make
any noise. We have a visitor.

276
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,240
- A snake.
- Yeah, I saw.

277
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,279
- There.
- Oh shit.

278
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,440
I asked it to leave.

279
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:21,519
What d'you mean?

280
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,400
- I talk to animals.
- Aren't you a psychiatrist?

281
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:29,039
Since when do shrinks
talk to animals?

282
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:31,440
I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna die.

283
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,000
I need a drink or I'll die!

284
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,480
Ivan, we all have
natural antidepressants.

285
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,680
When you're scared, you breathe
to calm down.

286
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,160
It's exactly the same for withdrawal.

287
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,880
Inhale.

288
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,920
Exhale.
That's it.

289
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,440
- What's she giving him?
- Herb tea, probably.

290
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:00,759
I'll be right back.

291
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,799
Snakes and she splits?

292
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,599
They could come back any time!

293
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,799
She's off to a homeowners' meeting
with the wolves.

294
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:21,400
- Sorry.
- No problem.

295
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:32,279
So we just wait for her.

296
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:34,440
I see.

297
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:39,880
What...

298
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,839
It's Belphegor.

299
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,400
Belphegor.

300
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:51,440
It's Carnival time in the backwoods.

301
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Jesus.

302
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,039
To be perfectly honest,
you scared me.

303
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,599
- Yeah, me too.
- You too?

304
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,279
Between the drums...

305
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,799
and the screams...

306
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,119
I was afraid you'd slit my throat.

307
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,160
Gentlemen, your talking stick.

308
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,079
He who holds it speaks.

309
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,519
I want you to share
why you're here in one sentence.

310
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,079
Hippolyte.

311
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,200
Okay, fine.
For me, it'll be quick.

312
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:23,000
My daughter tricked me into coming.

313
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,160
So...

314
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,960
I don't like those hands all over me.

315
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:38,920
We'd be accused of sexual harassment.

316
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,519
So, no idea why I'm here
and I want to hit the sack.

317
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,640
Your turn.

318
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,720
Easy does it, Ivan.

319
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,039
You all know why I'm here.
Next.

320
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,880
- My name is Fire Man and I'm here...
- What?

321
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,440
Fire Man... Fire Man.

322
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,960
You serious?

323
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:07,200
What's your nickname,
Pierre, Paul?

324
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:08,960
- No stick, no talk.
- Sorry.

325
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,599
The ritual is sacred.

326
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,599
A nightingale.

327
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,400
- He agrees with me.
- Of course.

328
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,359
Why are you here, Fire Man?

329
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,519
It was this...

330
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,920
or a shrink.

331
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,640
My name is Antoine.

332
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,839
- My husband wants to leave me.
- Your husband?

333
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,240
"Men only" means...

334
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,480
Fire, who has the stick?

335
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,440
I'm done.

336
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,440
Thanks.

337
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,000
My name is Noé.

338
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,799
And I think

339
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,279
I'm here to...

340
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,599
channel my energy.

341
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,759
That's great. Bravo.

342
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,559
Thank you, Noé.

343
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,799
I'm Romain and this is not for me.

344
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:22,519
I can't do this. I thought it was
about personal development

345
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:25,599
and we're here playing drums...

346
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:27,519
I...

347
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:31,240
I'm afraid. I'm afraid of...

348
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:33,839
I don't like grass or the nature.

349
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,799
I'm afraid of snakes and wolves.

350
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,880
Thank you.
What's your story, Michel?

351
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,000
I don't have one.

352
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:56,160
- We all have a story.
- Not me.

353
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,880
You're courageous.

354
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,440
You're all very courageous.

355
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:11,680
You're here because you're unhappy,
like most of us,

356
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,680
but you want to change.

357
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,759
Tonight, we peeled
the first layer of the onion.

358
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,720
Congratulations.

359
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,440
What's that?
You mean we could've come by car?

360
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:35,519
Where you going?

361
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,279
Who's that?

362
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,240
Yourgos, my man.
He's an angel.

363
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,839
Tomorrow morning, washed,
dressed and wide awake at 6 am.

364
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,279
- 6 am?
- No way!

365
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,400
Don't forget the dishes!
Just kidding.

366
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,480
Right, show off.
In our faces.

367
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,680
Wait.

368
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,440
At three, we run back to camp.

369
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,720
We stay in a group.

370
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,759
One, two, three!

371
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,799
Go, go, go!
In a group, I'll bring up the rear!

372
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,279
This is your fault!

373
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:14,599
You were rude
so she called the wolves.

374
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,319
- It's your fault.
- Calm down, kids.

375
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,240
She talks to animals, my ass.

376
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:23,640
- I don't talk to babies.
- I'm no baby.

377
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,000
- Hey, stop.
- No more talk about her.

378
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,279
- Is the door shut?
- Quiet, please.

379
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,559
I'll check.

380
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,839
Unless they know the code, we're safe.

381
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,720
Anyone have a water flask?

382
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Here.

383
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,720
I was going to piss outside,
but not now.

384
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:46,880
Piss in my flask?

385
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,359
- I'll rinse it out.
- No way, that's gross!

386
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,559
- It's bacteria free.
- I'm not drinking your piss!

387
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,319
Pass it over when you're done.
I'm not going outside.

388
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,640
- Me too.
- So my flask is the john.

389
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,799
- Time to switch off the lights.
- No, don't.

390
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,920
At least one.
Oh, fuck.

391
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,480
What's that?

392
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,960
Silence!

393
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,680
Shut the fuck up!

394
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,599
- Moron.
- I don't believe it.

395
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,680
- What was it?
- Bunch of wackos.

396
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,440
Button it, Robert.

397
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:09,119
Please meet my two dogs, Yuki & Miki.
They came to lend a hand.

398
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,920
- We said up and ready at 6 am.
- Shit!

399
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,920
Get lost, dog.

400
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,079
I'm glad to see you're motivated.

401
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,799
Sorry, ouch! Sorry, Coach.

402
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,680
- Fucking hell!
- My abs are killing me.

403
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:25,960
- In the shower!
- I can't move.

404
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,920
- Yes, you can move.
- No, I can't.

405
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,039
Sore muscles remind you that
you have a body.

406
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,119
Don't make me laugh.

407
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:42,640
- I'm dying.
- Hang on a sec, you!

408
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,160
He sleeps outside tonight.
You got nasty digestive issues.

409
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,279
And your tennies stink.

410
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,759
- It's cause of you we didn't sleep.
- Me?

411
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:53,119
- Your gadget.
- You know what this is?

412
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,359
It's for sleep apnea, dummy.
I could die without it.

413
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,200
I couldn't sleep
cause of Michel and Hippolyte.

414
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,079
You guys sound like 747s.
All night long.

415
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,240
Knock it off. Michel, maybe.

416
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,839
- I don't snore.
- You don't snore?

417
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,880
- Yes, Hippolyte, you do.
- You snore.

418
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,119
A little noise like this...

419
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,759
That's exactly it.

420
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,920
And at the end it's like...

421
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,640
That's it.
That's exactly it.

422
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,519
I slept with my wife for 40 years.
She'd have told me.

423
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:34,720
- We didn't last one night.
- She takes sleeping pills.

424
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,279
- No.
- Earplugs.

425
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:40,160
She wore earplugs
for the garbage truck at 5 am.

426
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,400
The garbage truck is in your nose.

427
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,319
Don't make me laugh.

428
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,640
Your wife must love you.

429
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:53,279
I don't have one.
She died.

430
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,680
Anyone offers condolences,
I'll slug his face.

431
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:58,680
Got it?

432
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,920
My condolences, Hippolyte.

433
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:07,839
A tiny "plop"!

434
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:10,279
Let's go.

435
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,880
Too old.

436
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,359
Excused.

437
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,920
I hear you.

438
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,920
What's he doing?

439
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,960
- Hey, get lost!
- Skinny-dipping are we? Good idea.

440
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,000
Anyone got the time?

441
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:38,400
It's a perfect time to die.

442
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,519
Here we go.

443
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,119
I'm King of the World!

444
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,880
I'm gonna puke first. It'll be cleaner.

445
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,680
- He won't jump.
- It's alright.

446
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,759
No problem.

447
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:55,359
- I'm gonna go.
- Good, Elliot.

448
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:58,039
- Okay, I'm going.
- Go on.

449
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,279
I am.
I'm going.

450
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:07,279
- He's not going.
- Who's the baby?

451
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:09,519
- Did you jump?
- No, not yet.

452
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:12,559
- We're waiting.
- I hate insects but I love water.

453
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,759
Go, Romain!

454
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,559
- Jump far from the edge.
- Naturally.

455
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,880
- Go on.
- I am.

456
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,400
- I'm watching.
- Okay.

457
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,880
- Fantastic.
- I'm going dressed. I'll dry in the sun.

458
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:31,279
- Want me to count to three?
- No, thanks.

459
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,559
My heart's palpitating!

460
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,759
- It's done it all morning.
- I...

461
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:43,359
- My mouth is dry and I can't breathe.
- Michel, listen.

462
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,319
- You're afraid.
- Yes, I'm afraid.

463
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,160
80% of our fears are nothing.

464
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,039
They're creations
of our imaginations and minds.

465
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,920
Look your fear in the eye...

466
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,039
Holy shit.

467
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,640
Bravo, Michel!

468
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,079
Give him a round of applause.

469
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,920
Good job, Michel!

470
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,039
Water's great!

471
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,440
Come on!

472
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:13,839
You show off, but no one's jumping.

473
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:18,480
Michel had nothing to lose.

474
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,960
You all have strong survival instincts.

475
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:23,640
That's good news.

476
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,920
And maybe
Michel is happier to be alive.

477
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,440
It's fabulous.

478
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,240
Playtime with earthworms!

479
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,279
Hold your horses, what earthworms?

480
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,279
There we go.

481
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,200
You're magnificent.

482
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,920
- So are you.
- Thank you.

483
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:50,240
- Upon your lovely words, goodbye.
- No, you can't leave!

484
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,039
Hey, if I knew you were leaving,
I'd have said no!

485
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,799
Vultures, they attack the eyes.

486
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,720
- What?
- Don't you know?

487
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,119
- This is a criminal act!
- We're helpless.

488
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,720
- There're insects!
- Breathe deeply.

489
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,119
- We're stuck in the dirt.
- Help, there's a wasp.

490
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,799
Little beasts don't eat big ones.

491
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:20,319
- I'm thirsty.
- Fuck.

492
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,160
- I need to pee.
- Me too.

493
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:25,079
- I've peed for hours.
- That's it.

494
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,880
- I'm pissing.
- Me too.

495
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,559
I'm empty.

496
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,759
Where did we go wrong
to end up here?

497
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,240
I'm gonna have a stroke.

498
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,680
I'm fainting.

499
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,319
I'm such an idiot.
What am I doing here?

500
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,559
The site
clearly stated that the principle...

501
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,559
I let myself
be buried alive by a psychopath!

502
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,000
And I paid for it.
I don't believe it.

503
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:04,599
She's not a psychopath, she's creative.

504
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,679
In the USA,
there're 300 cases a year of castration.

505
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,480
Some broad cut her guy's dick off
and flushed it down the toilet.

506
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:18,280
But he called the water company
and they brought it back.

507
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,719
He got it sewn back on. True story.

508
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,559
You can get it sewn back on!

509
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,960
- Why bring that up?
- It's my nighttime phobia.

510
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,960
I can't feel it anymore.

511
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,000
You know what, guys?

512
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,800
You know what we're doing?
Creating memories.

513
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,000
Fabulous memories.

514
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,280
For the first time,
I feel like I'm with family.

515
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,719
No, Michel.

516
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,320
This won't make nice memories.

517
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,519
It's better than state custody.

518
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,639
You never had a foster home?

519
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,239
Sure, but never longer than one week.

520
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,239
I scared them.

521
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,440
I get anxiety attacks.

522
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,880
It makes people uncomfortable...

523
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,599
so they didn't keep me.

524
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,480
I've always been alone.

525
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,119
You must have friends?

526
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:15,519
No.

527
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:21,880
Colleagues?
What about colleagues?

528
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,360
We say hello and goodbye.
Sometimes not even.

529
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,880
But here, I feel good.

530
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,480
With you all, in the nature.

531
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:35,000
It's funny, I'm always underground
and it feels awful.

532
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,199
And here, it's great.

533
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,679
Think she'll come back?

534
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,239
I think she's hiding in the rocks,
spying on us,

535
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,000
waiting for us to break down.

536
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,199
- She's screwed because we won't.
- Cause we're men!

537
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,039
- What's the link?
- Won't break down...

538
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:54,719
To the end!
Right, guys?

539
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,760
Don't think
of David Bowie as Major Celliers.

540
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,159
Shut the fuck up, would you?

541
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
I felt good but not anymore.

542
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,400
Why didn't you tell me I snored?

543
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:09,440
- Why didn't you...
- Don't think of David Bowie...

544
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:10,800
Don't think of Bowie...

545
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:13,440
- Shut up!
- How's the film end?

546
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,440
David Bowie dies!
3rd degree burns!

547
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,679
I'm thirsty!

548
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,840
Coach is coming.

549
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:28,639
She's here.

550
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:38,000
- Get me out.
- We're here! We didn't move!

551
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,199
Water... I'm thirsty.

552
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,800
Go, my friend.
Go live your life.

553
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,599
Unearth us!

554
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:09,719
I can't do this. I'll be back.

555
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,480
Was humiliation the goal?

556
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:18,679
- You guys feel better?
- Worse than ever.

557
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,480
- No, not at all.
- I want to be home, in my own bed.

558
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,480
I'm fed up.

559
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,280
Are you married?

560
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,119
Not married, but I've been
in a relationship for a few years.

561
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:38,800
We have a child.

562
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:41,800
What about you,
do you date?

563
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:45,519
A while back...

564
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,480
I missed the last metro.
I was at a concert that ended...

565
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:52,519
kind of late.

566
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,719
I was in the red light district.

567
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,119
So, uh...
I saw a pretty woman with red hair.

568
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:01,559
So I thought...

569
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,920
why not try?

570
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:06,440
- Yeah, sure.
- So...

571
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,280
I paid her.

572
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,719
That in itself was... awkward.

573
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,880
Then...

574
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:18,760
after I paid her, I thought
she'd take me somewhere warm.

575
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:21,920
Someplace cozy. But...

576
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:25,400
she said, "No, it's right here.

577
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:27,360
"Right here...

578
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,119
"on the sidewalk."

579
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,280
So...

580
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:34,800
I didn't...

581
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:39,119
I didn't really like it
so I wanted to stop.

582
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:41,480
But since I'd paid...

583
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,800
she kind of forced me.

584
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,599
And that was...

585
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,320
my only sexual relation.

586
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,360
It wasn't at all like I imagined.

587
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,360
Did you know that
hugs are good for your health?

588
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,480
No.

589
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:15,679
When you give someone a hug,

590
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:19,800
it releases a hormone
called oxytocin.

591
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:24,039
- Oxyto...
- Oxytocin. The happy hormone.

592
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:25,880
Not easy to say.

593
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,480
Say "happy hormone."
Sappy homer...

594
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:30,280
Happy hormone.

595
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:35,920
It calms stress
and gives you a sensation of well-being.

596
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,559
It's great for the immune system too.

597
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:43,519
You should do it five times a day.
Five fruits and veggies, and five hugs.

598
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:44,599
Not bad.

599
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,599
Want to try?

600
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,719
- Okay.
- Come here.

601
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,199
We move closer.
Like this...

602
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,199
and you hug me.

603
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:00,119
It has to last 20 seconds to work.

604
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:08,599
- Easy does it. Easy, Michel.
- Sorry.

605
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,039
Reminds me of scouts.

606
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:17,039
Fond memories of hiking
and making friends.

607
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:20,920
- Really.
- We'd sing around the campfire.

608
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:27,159
That's good.
Twenty seconds.

609
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:28,840
Why do you need to channel?

610
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,880
- You can let me go now.
- Okay.

611
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,760
I didn't know apples were juicy.

612
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:48,000
- I never eat them, but they're not bad.
- And I'm eating fucking seeds.

613
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,840
I want steak, veal and rack of lamb.
We're not herbivores!

614
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,920
Go hunt.

615
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,920
Go yourself.

616
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,280
- I'm trying to cut down on meat.
- Me too.

617
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,440
I'm a vegan!

618
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,639
Don't you get it?

619
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:07,519
- You got grandkids?
- Yes.

620
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,199
Be happy
some of us care about their future.

621
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:14,519
Soup's ready.

622
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,920
Soup!

623
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,440
Where's he going?
What's he doing?

624
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,840
- Pretty birdie...
- The rooster...

625
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,079
Come here, you.

626
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,239
- Hippolyte, you won't get far like that.
- Wrong method.

627
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,719
- He's too old.
- He's faster than you.

628
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,840
The creature's got spunk.

629
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,199
- Screwballs.
- Look at his face.

630
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,599
- He'll never catch it.
- Pretty birdie!

631
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:53,760
- Let him be, keeps him busy.
- He'll never catch it.

632
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,519
They taught us a method in scout camp...

633
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:59,320
- Give me some seeds.
- They're for us.

634
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,000
What're you doing?

635
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:21,599
- It's against the law!
- It's a household pet.

636
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,119
- Don't do it, Hippolyte!
- It's Coach's rooster.

637
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,360
It's against the law!

638
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,519
- You okay?
- I can't take it.

639
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,480
One plucks, another guts.

640
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:37,360
- He killed it?
- Don't thank me.

641
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,599
That was shameful.

642
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,920
Did you kill Robert? Did he?

643
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,039
- I prefer when you smile.
- They're widows, like you. Good job!

644
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,840
Calm down.

645
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:49,039
He's whistling.

646
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:54,519
I see why no one kept him.
They adopt a kid and got a bird.

647
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:59,199
Why'd you baptize it anyhow?

648
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:08,079
You know what?
You're a bitter, self-centered old fart.

649
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:11,960
You've spoiled our stay from the start.
Murderer!

650
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,920
Leave me alone.

651
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,320
- So that's an attack.
- Stay with me.

652
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:24,000
Poor guy.

653
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,800
- You okay, Michel?
- Just fine.

654
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,719
- It's over.
- Did you see that?

655
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,880
With this diet, my bowel movements
have never been so regular.

656
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,079
Lucky you, me it's the opposite.

657
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,519
I'll have a blueberry.

658
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:48,320
- You okay?
- I don't know, I feel...

659
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,599
- Hang on.
- Is he sick?

660
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:56,920
- I'll give him a cardiac massage.
- Who says it's his heart?

661
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,400
We're stuck here, can't even call 911.

662
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,480
You okay, kid?

663
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:04,079
I'll check his pulse.

664
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:06,400
I feel weird too.

665
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,639
- I feel funny too.
- You sick?

666
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:11,079
- I'm not okay.
- What's wrong?

667
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:12,840
I think I'm going to die.

668
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,719
I'm not okay.

669
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:19,039
- It's Grandma.
- Where?

670
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,599
- But she died two years ago.
- I'm wondering about the herb tea.

671
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:26,679
Kiddo, did you drink herb tea?

672
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,559
- Why does he say that?
- Romain, did you drink some?

673
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,639
Michel, what's in the soup?

674
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:38,000
- Carrots, leeks, mushrooms...
- What?

675
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,400
Mushrooms are serious business.

676
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,360
- Some death caps look edible.
- We're gonna die!

677
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,039
What'd you feed us?

678
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:49,960
Gentlemen,
we've eaten hallucinogens.

679
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:52,719
- Holy shit.
- I hear the grass growing.

680
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:58,320
I'm in plant mode,
a dandelion is growing out of my ear.

681
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,000
- You see?
- It's parsley.

682
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,239
- But I'm not panicking, don't panic.
- I ate magic mushrooms.

683
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:08,480
Can you hear that?

684
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,480
My heart's growing in my neck.

685
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,280
- You're so handsome.
- Thank you. Lie down, guys.

686
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:18,679
It's hailing! You're nuts!

687
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,079
Seek shelter!

688
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:22,039
We're gonna die!

689
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:27,280
- Puke before it's too late.
- My daughter made me smoke dope.

690
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,480
That stuff doesn't work on me.

691
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,400
I was hungry.

692
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:37,320
I didn't want to hurt you, Robert.

693
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:40,519
Guys, we have to bury him.

694
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,119
I see his soul flying away.

695
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,000
Tears are warm.

696
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,280
I'd forgotten.

697
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,480
I didn't cry a single one

698
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:04,079
when my wife died.

699
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:08,639
I didn't even tell her I loved her.

700
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,079
I'm pathetic.

701
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:13,679
- No.
- Yes, I am.

702
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:16,039
It's all pathetic.

703
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:22,519
- We'll sing for our dead.
- For Robert too.

704
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:25,599
- For Robert.
- And the others who've passed.

705
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,800
What do we sing?

706
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:45,000
So beautiful.

707
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,360
We didn't sleep much. First a funfair,
then a snoring concerto

708
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,760
and everything else.

709
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,360
I have a headache.

710
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:56,039
My stomach hurts.
I've been blocked up since I got here.

711
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:58,199
"Blocked."
Let the word resonate.

712
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,880
Blocked.

713
00:48:02,719 --> 00:48:04,599
Stop, it's not funny.

714
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:07,599
It's like a rock inside me.

715
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:10,400
- Hi.
- Hi, Noé.

716
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:16,039
No, I'm fine.

717
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:18,599
Top form.

718
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:23,000
Raring to go.

719
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,119
Stop it.

720
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,880
Noé, are you a singer?

721
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,800
- Not at all.
- You got a helluva voice.

722
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,039
- Thanks, that's nice.
- No, it's true.

723
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,039
Really?

724
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,559
Even opera... I love opera.
You should try.

725
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,079
You hear that?

726
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,199
- You got a voice.
- I got a voice!

727
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,719
Sure I'm not bothering you?

728
00:48:58,199 --> 00:48:59,800
Some tea or cookies?

729
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,239
That would be great.

730
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:06,440
Let's go.

731
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,760
She is truly...

732
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,039
She is truly exceptional!

733
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:21,039
It's hot in here.

734
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:25,199
Imagine you're
inside Mother Earth's womb.

735
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:27,199
And she's talking to you.

736
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,119
Listen to her.

737
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,400
Fuck, it's hot.

738
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:39,880
I'm suffocating.

739
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:44,519
It's like a microwave.
Any second now it'll go "beep."

740
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:46,800
That's it, we're cooked.

741
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,320
Like a...

742
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,039
chicken-pot-pie.

743
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:52,480
Michel,
you should take your jacket off.

744
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,599
Who cares about his jacket?
We need rest.

745
00:49:56,679 --> 00:49:59,760
We need rest, a little rest.

746
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:03,840
- I can't take anymore.
- Express yourself, let it all out.

747
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,519
I am expressing myself!

748
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,440
- Keep talking.
- But I said everything.

749
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:10,599
- I'm tired.
- I understand.

750
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:12,920
- I need to get out.
- It'll be okay.

751
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:15,760
I still haven't found a solution...

752
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:20,199
Shut him up, I can't take
any more of his stomach problems.

753
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,519
- Cut the girlie crap.
- What's your problem with girls?

754
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:27,760
Girls are... they sit there...

755
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,199
they always have to...
it's always complicated...

756
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,400
they talk...

757
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,559
- I don't get a word.
- Me either.

758
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:36,440
- Let him talk.
- That idiot.

759
00:50:36,519 --> 00:50:38,480
- Go on.
- I'm done.

760
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:41,400
No, carry on.

761
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,840
You want to know?
They never shut up.

762
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,440
Kind of like you.

763
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:47,679
Seriously.

764
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,239
- Bravo, Fire.
- Shut up!

765
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,360
- Stop, Elliot.
- Wake up, dudes!

766
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,880
Shut your fucking face!

767
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,079
Shut your face!

768
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,559
- Noé, stop!
- Shit, his nose is bleeding.

769
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:07,239
Here, take this.

770
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:09,760
Press down.

771
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:11,760
You're bleeding.

772
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,800
Noé, look what you did.

773
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:16,840
You okay?

774
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,239
You'll be okay.

775
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:24,119
You're fine.

776
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:25,639
Sorry, guys.

777
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:27,559
Sorry.

778
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:31,760
I like that better.
That's good.

779
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:35,639
Let's be honest,
we've all wanted to slug him once.

780
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:37,559
Twice.

781
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:40,039
After a while,
it's legitimate defense.

782
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,039
You think it's easy?

783
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,480
You think it's easy for me to be 18

784
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,840
and look like I'm 13?

785
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,480
Every day at school

786
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,679
people tease me and insult me.

787
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:54,920
And I can't do shit because...

788
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,360
I'm an adult in a kid's body
and it'll never change.

789
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,119
No reason to insult women and gays.

790
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,679
- He's right.
- It's a jungle out there.

791
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,559
It's precisely cause of jerks like you
that I don't want to adopt.

792
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:14,880
That's enough.

793
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,480
Want people to accept you?
Then accept them! And yourself.

794
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,679
That was interesting, Antoine.

795
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,239
Accept others and accept yourself.

796
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,119
We'll slowly form the circle again.

797
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,840
- The kid's nose is bleeding.
- I'm done being polite!

798
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,840
I'm fed up of your beatnik thing.
My stomach hurts.

799
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,079
- I'm sick.
- Go out.

800
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,800
Water, water...

801
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,639
It's a shame, Antoine.
But don't worry.

802
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,880
When one door closes,
another opens.

803
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,239
- In the face sometimes.
- A door opens?

804
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,719
- Forget it.
- Lunch break.

805
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:10,559
Then we move on to the next activity.

806
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:13,360
You should try poetry.

807
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,079
Poetry?

808
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,360
- Does that work?
- It sure does.

809
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:22,079
Some friendly advice.

810
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,000
What are you doing?

811
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,679
It's a wish tree.

812
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,719
I'm making a wish.

813
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,559
Me too.

814
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,679
I saw you there.

815
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,280
You're right,
you don't channel well.

816
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:49,679
You're like me.

817
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:53,760
- I'm an asshole like my dad.
- An asshole?

818
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,960
I knew assholes in homes.
You're not.

819
00:53:57,039 --> 00:53:59,639
Assholes like you
would've changed my life.

820
00:53:59,719 --> 00:54:00,679
So stop it.

821
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,440
My mom's still with him.

822
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,679
He treats her so bad.

823
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,960
I'm afraid for her.

824
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,679
Then kidnap her.

825
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:16,480
I'd like to.

826
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,400
But...

827
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,760
she'd rather die
than leave her garden.

828
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,719
Noé...

829
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:31,440
Come here.

830
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:50,519
Well?

831
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,280
- Nothing?
- No, nothing.

832
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,159
- Well?
- A brick in my gut.

833
00:54:55,239 --> 00:54:56,480
It's living hell.

834
00:54:57,079 --> 00:54:59,719
- Not even a little turd?
- Poor guy.

835
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:02,000
Let's pick some tomatoes.

836
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:04,679
Tomatoes are Feng Shui.

837
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:06,880
C'mon, let's make a wish.

838
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:15,880
Here, this is for your wish.

839
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:19,239
I'm sorry.

840
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:22,960
Thanks, Noé.

841
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,360
It'll work, you'll see.

842
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,199
- Help me pick carrots?
- No.

843
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:56,880
She's got her apartment, her kids,

844
00:55:57,239 --> 00:55:59,800
the fathers of her kids who she adores,

845
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,239
her job,
her sex toys...

846
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,119
What am I good for?

847
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,679
We men are good for nothing.

848
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,440
- Everybody knows that.
- I disagree.

849
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,800
I fell in love
for the first time at 50.

850
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,079
That's all.
It makes you stupid.

851
00:56:17,159 --> 00:56:19,679
- No, it doesn't.
- Besides, as I grow older...

852
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,800
The machinery bugs.

853
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,599
- What?
- Sometimes...

854
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,840
I go a teeny bit soft, out of the blue.

855
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,119
Suddenly it goes limp.

856
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,719
No big deal.

857
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,760
No big deal?
I can guarantee you that usually...

858
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,320
But nothing's like usual.

859
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,440
When I have a teeny little erection,
I'm having a good day.

860
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:46,039
- Ditto!
- What d'you mean "ditto"?

861
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:48,440
- Join the club.
- You too?

862
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,480
You're only thirty.

863
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:54,159
- Maybe it's andropause.
- Andro...

864
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:56,039
- Andropause.
- What's that?

865
00:56:56,119 --> 00:56:57,519
Man-o-pause!

866
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:01,719
It's hormonal, a drop in testosterone.

867
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,159
- I have that?
- Maybe.

868
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:07,639
- Maybe yes, maybe no.
- First sign, erection difficulties.

869
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:09,880
It's not a big problem.

870
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,679
- A little problem nonetheless.
- Like everyone.

871
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,239
Lower libido?

872
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:17,000
- Yeah, a little.
- Mood swings?

873
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:18,599
What about...

874
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:22,360
Yep, the external oblique
is coming out.

875
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:26,400
- Little love handles.
- I work out but it won't go away.

876
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,559
He's got nothing.

877
00:57:27,639 --> 00:57:29,960
I didn't have menopause,
I have old age.

878
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:33,079
- That's worse.
- Menopause is for women.

879
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,079
- Get a hormonal checkup.
- I'm losing my hair too, everything.

880
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:41,000
- Get a checkup.
- Why didn't my doctor tell me?

881
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,079
It's kind of a taboo subject.

882
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,320
As soon as we're done here,
I'm getting a checkup.

883
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,760
- Get your checkup, but take my advice...
- What?

884
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,239
Stop trying to control things.

885
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,920
Your life and your wife's.
Trust an old fart, it feels good.

886
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:00,000
Let go.

887
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,639
I'm letting go!
Let go...

888
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:08,679
I'm everywhere!
I'm the air and the wind.

889
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:12,519
- Find the tiger inside you!
- What the fuck?

890
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:14,920
- Find it!
- Hey, this is grub time.

891
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,199
Gentle gazelle.

892
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,880
- We're wiped out.
- I'm the snake.

893
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:21,800
What's this activity?

894
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:24,920
We're in for an hour of drums.

895
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,400
Hey, she ate the soup.

896
00:58:29,559 --> 00:58:32,000
- All of it.
- One bowl did me in.

897
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:37,000
- Mushrooms are nature.
- You saw what nature did to us.

898
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:38,079
She's connected.

899
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:42,119
She's biting me!
Stop it!

900
00:58:43,719 --> 00:58:44,760
Catch her!

901
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,320
- Make a circle around her!
- Coach!

902
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,519
- Easy does it.
- Keep an equal distance.

903
00:58:53,719 --> 00:58:54,679
I love you.

904
00:58:55,639 --> 00:58:56,679
I love you all.

905
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,440
I feel you without
your skyscrapers and roads.

906
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:02,039
The poison is suffocating me!

907
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:04,639
I'm going to die.
I can't breathe.

908
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,719
- This has to stop.
- It's okay, it's all over.

909
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,159
- Would you like to sit?
- My love.

910
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:30,400
You've changed. You said goodbye
and the light came back.

911
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,639
- Know who you are?
- No.

912
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:39,840
- No?
- Yes.

913
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,840
Yes.

914
00:59:41,239 --> 00:59:42,320
No.

915
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:43,880
Yes.

916
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:49,280
Hurry to slow down.

917
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:51,239
Or else...

918
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,159
I'm so happy.

919
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,320
I'm so happy.

920
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,599
So happy.

921
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:12,000
Hurry to slow down, okay?

922
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,239
It's getting late, don't you think?

923
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:19,199
It's time to go back, Coach.

924
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,159
- Sweetheart?
- It's Cournos.

925
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:30,239
You crazy?
Another workshop in September?

926
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,840
- Sweetheart.
- Excuse me one sec.

927
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,519
What's in September?
New York.

928
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:38,119
New York.

929
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:40,039
It's been two years.

930
01:00:40,519 --> 01:00:44,079
We wait around
while madam gives workshops.

931
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:47,280
I need a break too.
Home schooling all day...

932
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:51,440
Garden, clean, cook,
dig holes and never a word of thanks!

933
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,119
Digging holes is a fucking pain.
I hate the nature!

934
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,559
Grass, trees, birds... I hate it all.

935
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:01,280
Birds chirping!

936
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,360
I want buildings,
traffic, cars honking, pollution!

937
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:06,559
I want neon lights.

938
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,199
I want to eat with silverware.

939
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,519
But everything's for your men.

940
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:14,519
Your men...

941
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,480
But now
you'll take care of your kids.

942
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:20,519
Remember, you have kids?
Cause I'm out of here.

943
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:21,920
Come on.

944
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:29,000
- You should go.
- Sure?

945
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:30,239
Yes, go on.

946
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,960
Tomorrow, 6 am on the dot!

947
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:40,719
- Have a nice evening.
- Thank you, sir.

948
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:45,239
- Yourgos, what a name.
- Pseudo-Greek.

949
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,920
Greek? Texan is more like it.

950
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,760
- Half-kebab half-taco.
- You see his exhaust smoke?

951
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,239
Seriously, his car pollutes.

952
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,559
- Yourgos, zero percent.
- Sounds like a subcompact.

953
01:01:57,639 --> 01:02:01,719
"Yourgos, the electric 4-seater
for nature outings."

954
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,760
Think he's Blue Book rated?

955
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,559
I'm in top form.

956
01:02:07,639 --> 01:02:10,599
- Scout, what's up?
- I'm too tired to care.

957
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:15,880
- Feels good to lie down.
- Oh yeah.

958
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:17,639
I'm exhausted.

959
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:22,639
- Poor Omega must've gotten shit.
- Yeah, poor girl.

960
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:24,239
I'm too tired to sleep.

961
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,360
Noé?

962
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:28,760
That song you sang

963
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,639
the other day.

964
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:32,920
- Who was that?
- No one, it came to me.

965
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:37,239
- What do you mean?
- Songs come to me sometimes.

966
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,920
- Seriously?
- Can you sing it again?

967
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,480
Yeah, the song.

968
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:28,639
- Shut up, Darth Vader!
- This is a mental ward.

969
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:31,199
No wonder his wife left.
Guys, we gotta act.

970
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,920
This isn't nice.

971
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:43,079
Everyone ready?

972
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,639
Pot?

973
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,039
Boxer shorts?

974
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,880
- Knife?
- Yeah, I got it.

975
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:52,599
Balloon?

976
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:53,880
Go!

977
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:57,079
Say goodbye to your dick.

978
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,800
Never gonna
sew this one back on!

979
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,000
Bon voyage!

980
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:12,480
Gonna let us sleep?

981
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,400
Yes, yes.

982
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,639
Bunch of morons.

983
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,199
Hey, it's noon.

984
01:04:31,239 --> 01:04:32,519
Where's Coach?

985
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:39,360
- Every damn muscle aches.
- Boy, did I sleep.

986
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,920
You'll fry.

987
01:04:45,639 --> 01:04:47,679
It's not the beach, but still...

988
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,480
Fire Man.

989
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:57,519
- I like this song too.
- It's my mom's fave.

990
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,000
Undoing a button?

991
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:15,559
Still nothing?

992
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,239
I'm gonna give birth.

993
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:22,079
The idea...

994
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,039
of going back to Paris tomorrow

995
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,320
and being stuck underground...

996
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:30,760
I'm already having an anxiety attack.

997
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:33,519
Michel.

998
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,360
You know how to garden?

999
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,400
No, but...

1000
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:44,199
I could learn.

1001
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,440
I have a huge house in Normandy.

1002
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,679
I haven't touched the garden in six
months. I'm lost, it's beyond bad.

1003
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,079
You interested?

1004
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:00,239
Yes.

1005
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:03,000
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

1006
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:07,119
- You're saving my neck.
- You're saving mine too.

1007
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:10,119
How cool.
It's great.

1008
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:13,039
I didn't realize,
the solution was before my eyes.

1009
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,159
- Shake?
- Shake what?

1010
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,280
- Shake?
- Milkshake?

1011
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:19,280
No, a contract.
You shake on a contract.

1012
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,719
We're in business.
Shake.

1013
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:27,280
But I pay with food vouchers.
300 euros.

1014
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:30,159
- No, I'm joking.
- I'll draft the contract.

1015
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:32,760
- No problem.
- Yes, of course.

1016
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,920
Don't worry, I know labor law.

1017
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,079
It's not labor, Michel, it's fun.
We'll play every day.

1018
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:40,440
- It's hard work.
- Doesn't scare me.

1019
01:06:40,519 --> 01:06:42,679
My garden isn't too hard.

1020
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:45,840
The plants are tall,
you never have to bend down.

1021
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:47,760
Shit, classy.

1022
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:53,440
He's tall, strong, he's got hair on his
chest and a big house in Normandy.

1023
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:54,840
You're a real winner.

1024
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,800
- Yeah, if you like.
- And a gardener too.

1025
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,280
Shit, I can't stand this.

1026
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:05,719
Maybe it's like hiccups.
If I scare you... you shit?

1027
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,280
No, not at all.
Won't work.

1028
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,440
Idiot, it doesn't work like that.

1029
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:15,599
I don't care, I got a gardener.

1030
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,039
You know, Noé, for your mother...

1031
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:38,559
A garden...
can be moved.

1032
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,519
Contact deleted

1033
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:18,359
Hippolyte?

1034
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,239
- Your turn?
- Not unless it's a woman massaging.

1035
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,159
Breathe.

1036
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:34,720
Isn't this great?

1037
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,439
Hanging loose!

1038
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,319
Why do you guys say that?

1039
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:42,159
There she is, let's clean up.

1040
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:51,680
- Am I seeing things or did a kid drive?
- So now we babysit?

1041
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:54,560
I'm telling you frankly, I can't.

1042
01:08:56,199 --> 01:08:57,960
- There's five of them.
- Five kids?

1043
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,960
- What's up?
- We have a problem.

1044
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:02,760
We don't know what to do.

1045
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:06,560
- Mom's acting weird.
- And Daddy left.

1046
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:11,800
It's heartache. Believe me, I know.

1047
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,760
We'll take care of the kids.

1048
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:15,359
Sure.

1049
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:19,479
- We can't leave the kids alone.
- C'mon.

1050
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,600
Hey, kiddo,
that doesn't smell great.

1051
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,479
I don't know how you do it.

1052
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,640
Putting your hands in it.

1053
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,399
Babies are never dirty.

1054
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,319
- I'll help you.
- Yeah, take him.

1055
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:39,680
He doesn't like me.

1056
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:43,920
Come with me.

1057
01:09:46,039 --> 01:09:48,479
You know, I've been thinking...

1058
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,680
wouldn't Michel rather have had
two dads than none at all?

1059
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:59,439
- I couldn't adopt.
- Why not?

1060
01:10:00,039 --> 01:10:01,399
I don't fit the image.

1061
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,399
Other than

1062
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,439
being taunted at school.

1063
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:12,159
Kids all have their troubles.

1064
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:13,199
Besides...

1065
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,600
I can't do that to my parents.

1066
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:19,479
It'd kill them.

1067
01:10:20,439 --> 01:10:21,560
The marriage alone...

1068
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,399
So to make your man happy,
you have to adopt.

1069
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:29,000
But if you do,
you'll hurt your parents.

1070
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Is that it?

1071
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:33,880
And you?

1072
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:36,520
What do you want?

1073
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,319
Look at Antoine the scout.

1074
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:43,520
What'll we do with him?

1075
01:10:44,079 --> 01:10:46,760
What should Antoine do?
Adopt or not?

1076
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,880
Adopt me, Antoine the scout.

1077
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,840
My mother is crazy.

1078
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,880
She's crazy, she buries people.

1079
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,000
- She makes them jump...
- Hang on.

1080
01:10:59,439 --> 01:11:00,359
Geez.

1081
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:06,359
I think I'm good.
7.3 on the Richter scale.

1082
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,079
Oh my god, pure bliss.
I'd stopped hoping.

1083
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,279
Oh shit! True happiness!

1084
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,319
- Play with me.
- No.

1085
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:18,239
- Why are you pouting?
- Because I'm a man.

1086
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:21,720
- When one door closes...
- When one door opens...

1087
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:25,560
- When one door is open...
- When one door closes...

1088
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,359
...you need to open it.

1089
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:29,479
You don't believe me?

1090
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:32,399
You need to open the door first...

1091
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:35,560
No, when a door opens,
I mean closes... another opens.

1092
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,359
One door needs to close...

1093
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:40,119
- I prefer being a girl.
- You're very right.

1094
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:42,640
When one door closes, another opens.

1095
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:45,439
When a door opens,
you need to close it.

1096
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,279
- One closes, another opens.
- One door opens...

1097
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:50,439
One closes, another opens.

1098
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,840
- When one door opens...
- No, closes...

1099
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,359
When one door closes,
open it?

1100
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,039
She's gone.

1101
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:03,920
- We pretend we have a plan.
- Over there!

1102
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:08,279
Foul!

1103
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:12,960
It's better
to pull bandages off in one go.

1104
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,319
So, I have some bad news...

1105
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,199
I killed Robert.

1106
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:26,560
- Michel, you're with us.
- I didn't see.

1107
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:32,039
- Work the perineum!
- Special dedication to nature.

1108
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:37,279
I want to visit New York
and see buildings too!

1109
01:12:40,359 --> 01:12:43,199
I remember a guy who said...

1110
01:12:44,439 --> 01:12:47,960
noise makes us forget
and silence lets us remember.

1111
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:49,840
That's neat, huh?

1112
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:53,479
Unless you really
don't want to remember.

1113
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:57,640
Just an idea.

1114
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,039
Referee!

1115
01:13:06,039 --> 01:13:07,520
Give her a card!

1116
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,600
Red card!

1117
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,000
She's our best player.

1118
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:17,880
I feel much better.

1119
01:13:20,039 --> 01:13:21,319
I'm alive again.

1120
01:13:31,479 --> 01:13:34,880
There were
halogen mushrooms in the soup.

1121
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,279
Nice purée, Hippolyte.

1122
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,159
- I'm impressed.
- I got a purée-elbow.

1123
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:01,640
The kids will love it.

1124
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:06,479
- For a last day, we're doing good.
- Yeah.

1125
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:10,159
- You have kids, Ivan?
- Two.

1126
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:15,119
I haven't seen them in five years.

1127
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:19,319
Five years?

1128
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,119
Yes.
Five years.

1129
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:26,039
Keep playing... it helps.

1130
01:14:28,279 --> 01:14:29,319
Let's just say...

1131
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:31,279
I fucked up.

1132
01:14:33,439 --> 01:14:36,600
A big literary career can mess you up.

1133
01:14:37,159 --> 01:14:38,119
Hang on.

1134
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,640
Ivan...

1135
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:42,119
Ivan Lenoire?

1136
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:43,880
Yes.

1137
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:47,800
- We didn't talk about work.
- You idiots don't know him?

1138
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,119
- He writes fabulous novels.
- Wrote. It's over.

1139
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:56,520
Then start again. Why'd you stop?
Lots of people are sad, me included.

1140
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,199
Why did I stop?

1141
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:00,880
Success's fault.

1142
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,880
Let me explain.

1143
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:08,560
You're in your own little writer's world.

1144
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,920
A quiet, solitary life.

1145
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:16,479
And you share your work
with the people you love.

1146
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:20,680
My wife, my children.
For them I was a hero.

1147
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:23,199
Then you flip into another world.

1148
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:26,720
You have multitudes of friends
you don't even know.

1149
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:29,000
But they all want to love you.

1150
01:15:30,439 --> 01:15:32,399
It's very pleasant

1151
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,359
to be loved.

1152
01:15:34,439 --> 01:15:36,880
So in exchange,
you want to thank them.

1153
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,039
Each one of them.

1154
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:42,760
But saying thanks takes time,

1155
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:46,159
and it can take you very far.

1156
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:49,800
Then one day, your wife

1157
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:53,279
gets fed up of you being happy
elsewhere, without her.

1158
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:56,880
So she finds another guy
to carry the suitcases.

1159
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,039
And to justify this,

1160
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:02,520
she starts telling
anyone willing to listen...

1161
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:04,439
and they were many...

1162
01:16:05,079 --> 01:16:06,640
that you're a bastard.

1163
01:16:07,399 --> 01:16:08,560
A big fat bastard.

1164
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:12,840
Self-centered, violent and alcoholic.

1165
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:19,199
I'm not saying
I deserve "The Perfect Guy" award.

1166
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,159
But me, violent?

1167
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:23,960
That's not my language.

1168
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:30,439
So I found myself all alone like a fool
with my solitude.

1169
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:37,600
Yep.

1170
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:40,520
In any case, it's settled.

1171
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:44,119
She took off far away, to Los Angeles.

1172
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,479
8,000 miles.

1173
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:50,800
A 9-hour time difference.
So even if I wanted...

1174
01:16:52,039 --> 01:16:55,479
- You can't accept that.
- This is unbelievable.

1175
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,239
There are laws for dads too.

1176
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:01,399
Not having a dad is crap.
I haven't seen mine in four years.

1177
01:17:02,199 --> 01:17:06,119
He dumped my mom like a piece of shit.
Took off with his fat whore.

1178
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,159
I'm sorry, kid.

1179
01:17:11,399 --> 01:17:15,079
She can leave you,
but not the country with your kids.

1180
01:17:15,159 --> 01:17:18,319
Stand up for yourself.
Okay, sorry.

1181
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:28,119
I'll help you.

1182
01:17:30,119 --> 01:17:32,760
- You will?
- The great lawyer will help you.

1183
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:35,960
Here's the score.

1184
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:37,960
I don't have a penny.

1185
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:41,159
All I have left is this awful suit.

1186
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:45,760
I don't know if you can help me,

1187
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,239
but I have a ton of love
and no one to give it to.

1188
01:17:50,439 --> 01:17:51,720
I'll give you credit.

1189
01:17:52,359 --> 01:17:53,800
You'll pay me in love.

1190
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:58,279
Shake.

1191
01:18:05,399 --> 01:18:08,600
- Where's Coach? She was just there.
- Hey, yeah.

1192
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,680
If she got up, maybe it's good news.

1193
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:13,880
- She can't be far.
- Coach.

1194
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:16,359
Omega!

1195
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,039
Mom!

1196
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,119
She's disappeared.

1197
01:18:24,319 --> 01:18:25,680
You didn't find her?

1198
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,960
- What about the car?
- I checked.

1199
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:31,279
- We combed the area.
- No sign.

1200
01:18:31,359 --> 01:18:33,039
She must be in the woods.

1201
01:18:33,119 --> 01:18:36,479
- We can't go there.
- Put the young ones to bed.

1202
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:40,239
We'll bring your mother back.

1203
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:41,760
Hey, wait for me.

1204
01:18:44,079 --> 01:18:47,039
I suggest someone stay at camp
to keep watch.

1205
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:52,439
Like Coach said, we stick together
and we'll be safe.

1206
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,680
Let's go.

1207
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:00,399
Wait for me!

1208
01:19:02,359 --> 01:19:03,319
Wait!

1209
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:08,680
Don't shout so loud!

1210
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,840
- Our voices will draw animals.
- Watch your step.

1211
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,720
What's wrong now?
You hurt your leg?

1212
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,920
Make noise, it'll scare them off.

1213
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:24,319
The rooster is dead

1214
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:27,840
No more will he say cock-a-doodle-do

1215
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,239
- We didn't come this way.
- Yes, we did.

1216
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:32,520
- Don't think of Blair Witch.
- Shut up!

1217
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,199
The kids are all alone at camp.

1218
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:39,319
This isn't how
I imagined our last night.

1219
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:42,359
- Me either.
- Searching now makes no sense.

1220
01:19:42,439 --> 01:19:43,880
We can't see anything.

1221
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:46,000
We'll be eaten alive by insects.

1222
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:47,800
They can enter any orifice.

1223
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:51,039
Why tell us that?
We're not gonna sleep here.

1224
01:20:01,479 --> 01:20:02,600
Listen.

1225
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,800
- You hear?
- It's the waterfall.

1226
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,239
Where is she?

1227
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,119
- Isn't this her necklace?
- Oh shit.

1228
01:20:20,199 --> 01:20:21,359
Yes, it is.

1229
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,680
- You thinking like me?
- Maybe she went back to camp?

1230
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,920
This can't be.

1231
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,239
- You left my kids all alone?
- Coach!

1232
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:38,399
Boy are we glad to see you.

1233
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,680
- Here she is.
- You scared us.

1234
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,560
Don't worry,
your kids are safe at camp.

1235
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:48,479
I spoiled everything.

1236
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,359
- No, you didn't.
- What's wrong?

1237
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,479
I used to work in a hospital.

1238
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:00,800
All I did was knock people out
with medication.

1239
01:21:02,239 --> 01:21:06,760
When I got here,
I felt like I was alive again.

1240
01:21:10,279 --> 01:21:12,399
Like I'd found the key to happiness.

1241
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:17,520
So I wanted to share.

1242
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:22,279
Share my experience with other women.

1243
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,079
Then men.

1244
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,600
I haven't had a private life in years.

1245
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,399
I don't have a life.

1246
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:41,319
And I destroyed my family.

1247
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,479
You can't say that.

1248
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:49,239
All for useless workshops
for selfish guys who don't give a shit.

1249
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,359
That's not true, we give a shit.

1250
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:55,439
The human being is a pig
who doesn't give a shit.

1251
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:01,000
No one should have kids.
What'll they have?

1252
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:04,159
A polluted Earth,
oceans drowning in plastic.

1253
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:07,039
Wild animals are dying out.

1254
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,399
All of them!
Soon there won't be any bees.

1255
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:11,920
Real bees.

1256
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:16,039
And why?
Because we crushed everything.

1257
01:22:16,119 --> 01:22:19,319
Destroyed everything.
The feminine, the organic, nature.

1258
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:23,960
We don't care about the Moon,
we want to be first to go!

1259
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:26,600
We want to win, dominate.

1260
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:29,800
When we're all in this together.

1261
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:36,680
We came here
cause we were borderline.

1262
01:22:37,079 --> 01:22:38,000
So...

1263
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,600
if you break down, I'll sink.

1264
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:44,319
- Me too.
- A group suicide isn't ideal.

1265
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:50,680
Coach, you said it.
When one door closes...

1266
01:22:52,039 --> 01:22:54,479
- Another opens...
- Another opens.

1267
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,800
Hippolyte is right,
we should all kill ourselves.

1268
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:03,479
Right here,
at least we'd feed the fish.

1269
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,000
We'd be good for something!
Come on.

1270
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:13,760
There were magic mushrooms
in the soup.

1271
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:17,680
- It was my fault.
- That won't bring my man home.

1272
01:23:19,319 --> 01:23:23,079
But it could explain
the state you're in.

1273
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:26,479
So what? I'm the ultimate idiot.

1274
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,439
Stop it, that's enough.

1275
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:31,399
I'm better, we're all better.

1276
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:35,720
- I'm pathetic!
- You're a pain!

1277
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,399
It's not true.
What's this pessimism?

1278
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:42,399
What's he doing?

1279
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,760
- Hippolyte!
- You okay?

1280
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,520
That idiot.

1281
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,640
It's fantastic!
The water's fantastic.

1282
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:54,079
- Come on in!
- You okay?

1283
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:57,079
Take my hand.
Take my other hand.

1284
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:58,720
Coach?

1285
01:23:59,479 --> 01:24:00,720
This is for you.

1286
01:24:02,279 --> 01:24:03,680
- At worst...
- We die?

1287
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,199
- We die!
- But all together!

1288
01:24:18,039 --> 01:24:19,239
We did it!

1289
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:23,960
Hey, Noé.
Welcome.

1290
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:29,520
Relax. It's for my company elevators.
No one will ever hear it.

1291
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,600
If it's shit, it's for the john.

1292
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:33,479
Let's go.

1293
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,199
Take a deep breath, we're with you.

1294
01:24:55,039 --> 01:24:58,800
MEN ON THE VERGE
OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN

1295
01:25:02,359 --> 01:25:03,520
Come on, Omega!

1296
01:25:08,359 --> 01:25:10,479
- Want to taste?
- What's in it?

1297
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,640
- Every vegetable except...
- Mushrooms!

1298
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:15,720
It's great.

1299
01:25:16,199 --> 01:25:17,560
- Can you cope?
- Don't worry.

1300
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:19,960
Behave with Grandpa.

1301
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,920
Enjoy your evening.

1302
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,159
Jump!

1303
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:37,239
Your fiery hair...
Your fiery mane of hair...

1304
01:25:37,319 --> 01:25:39,000
Your veiled eyelids...

1305
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:45,439
Oops, sorry.
I didn't see you because I...

1306
01:25:50,199 --> 01:25:51,119
You're beautiful.

1307
01:25:53,479 --> 01:25:56,239
I thought I'd never be a grandmother.

1308
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:07,359
Do they have to call you Father?
They already have two.

1309
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:11,760
How about fruit juice?

1310
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:19,399
She said yes, Elliot Lecurse.

1311
01:26:19,479 --> 01:26:20,840
It's freezing!

1312
01:26:22,439 --> 01:26:23,560
What a dumb idea.

1313
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:27,960
You lost this.

1314
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:30,359
But how...

1315
01:26:33,039 --> 01:26:36,520
- It's great, we're friends now.
- Want a French kiss?

1316
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:43,000
- This is Michel. My mother, Evelyne.
- Happy to meet you.

1317
01:26:43,079 --> 01:26:45,640
We're neighbors.
I'm in the caretaker's house.

1318
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:49,239
You have the little house here.
We'll share the garden.

1319
01:26:49,319 --> 01:26:50,680
A hug, a real hug.

1320
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,199
It's nice and warm.

1321
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:57,520
I think someone's missing.

1322
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:00,800
Doesn't she deserve to join us?

1323
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:04,880
Come here!

1324
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:12,279
Gentle hug.

1325
01:27:13,239 --> 01:27:14,600
I think we're stuck.

1326
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:20,279
- Hey, look.
- Look!

1327
01:28:28,279 --> 01:28:29,399
Sorry, I...

1328
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:32,039
I got carried away.
