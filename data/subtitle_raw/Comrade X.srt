1
00:01:21,216 --> 00:01:22,884
Don't you think
it is unusual,

2
00:01:22,885 --> 00:01:24,986
calling the press together
like this in the Kremlin?

3
00:01:24,987 --> 00:01:27,490
There must be something has
happened, some new crisis.

4
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:29,827
Probably the government's
decided that from now on,

5
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:32,030
all foreign correspondents
must be blindfolded

6
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:34,067
and led around
by seeing eye dogs.

7
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:39,336
"Anything to keep the truth
out of print" is their motto.

8
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:42,672
Please, Miss Wilson,
do not speak for me.

9
00:01:42,676 --> 00:01:44,879
I am not complaining against
the Russian government.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,168
My dear Von Hofer,
a German journalist

11
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:48,884
is not
in the position

12
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:50,385
to complain against the
absence of truth anywhere.

13
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,034
Right you are,
Miss Wilson.

14
00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:53,224
Excuse me!

15
00:01:53,225 --> 00:01:54,892
With pleasure,
old boy.

16
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,472
Unversch√§mtheit!
<i>Impudence!</i>

17
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:58,732
A fine world press
we are.

18
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:02,237
We can't even send out a weather report
without having it censored.

19
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:03,571
Quiet, please.

20
00:02:03,572 --> 00:02:05,674
Commissar Vasiliev.

21
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:13,753
Ladies and gentlemen,

22
00:02:13,754 --> 00:02:16,624
I wish to inform you that I,
Commissar Vasiliev,

23
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,126
head of the secret police,

24
00:02:18,127 --> 00:02:20,695
have taken over the censorship
of the foreign press.

25
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:24,836
Quiet, please!

26
00:02:24,837 --> 00:02:27,273
This step has been
made necessary

27
00:02:27,274 --> 00:02:30,444
by the continued activities
of one of your colleagues

28
00:02:30,445 --> 00:02:33,114
who writes under
the name of Comrade X.

29
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:35,784
Pardon me, Commissar, but
Comrade Molkoff assured us

30
00:02:35,785 --> 00:02:38,422
that Comrade X had been
arrested and liquidated

31
00:02:38,423 --> 00:02:40,292
after making
a full confession.

32
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,627
My predecessor Comrade Molkoff
was mistaken,

33
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:46,300
unfortunately for him
and for the 3 unhappy citizens

34
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:48,302
of my country
whom he eliminated.

35
00:02:48,303 --> 00:02:50,139
Comrade X is still alive

36
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,742
and defying the censorship
of the Soviet.

37
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:55,746
He is still sending out
false stories!

38
00:02:55,747 --> 00:02:58,884
He is still photographing
forbidden places!

39
00:02:58,885 --> 00:03:00,753
And his malicious writings

40
00:03:00,754 --> 00:03:03,758
are still being broadcast
all over the world.

41
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,728
This situation
must be stopped!

42
00:03:07,297 --> 00:03:11,102
Until the real Comrade X is found,
every member of the foreign press

43
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:13,806
will be treated as a potential
enemy of the government.

44
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:15,941
You will not be allowed
to leave Moscow.

45
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:18,112
No permit of any kind
will be given.

46
00:03:18,113 --> 00:03:20,382
All telephone calls
will be under firm control.

47
00:03:20,383 --> 00:03:22,452
You might as well
have us deported.

48
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:25,089
We can't get out any stories
if we can't get around.

49
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,324
Exactly. You are
to get no stories.

50
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:28,927
Do I understand, commissar,

51
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:31,298
that we are not to
call on comrade Molkoff

52
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:33,301
for any news
from this department?

53
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:35,804
There is no
comrade Molkoff.

54
00:03:35,805 --> 00:03:38,474
The former head
of the press department

55
00:03:38,475 --> 00:03:41,913
was a victim last night
of a traffic accident.

56
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:45,852
He was apparently, shall we say,
not watching his step.

57
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:47,821
I am speaking
at his grave

58
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:50,258
at the kapulski cemetery
at 3:00.

59
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:58,871
Is Mr. Thompson here?

60
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,809
All correspondents
were asked to be here.

61
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,613
Where is McKinley B.
Thompson of the Topeka Bugle?

62
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:07,282
He's at kurkino,
commissar.

63
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:09,853
I got this telegram from
him yesterday morning.

64
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:12,557
"Am two bottles ahead in
officers' drinking contest.

65
00:04:12,558 --> 00:04:15,895
"Kindly send a few
rubles and a large ice bag

66
00:04:15,896 --> 00:04:17,965
for victorious return
to Moscow."

67
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:20,602
Silence!

68
00:04:22,806 --> 00:04:26,344
There will be no further
information from this department

69
00:04:26,345 --> 00:04:28,814
until Comrade X has been
finally disposed of.

70
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:30,182
Good day.

71
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:31,818
Well,
well, well!

72
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:46,839
What? Oh!
Oh, we're here, huh?

73
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,876
All right.

74
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:51,847
Oh. Yeah.

75
00:04:51,848 --> 00:04:53,282
Yeah, all right.

76
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:54,784
Here you are, sport.

77
00:04:54,785 --> 00:04:56,453
And don't kiss me.
Please.

78
00:04:56,454 --> 00:04:58,122
Hey, stop it.
Stop it!

79
00:04:58,123 --> 00:04:59,791
Go peddle your pigs.

80
00:05:02,297 --> 00:05:03,830
Mr. Thompson!

81
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:05,300
Ha ha ha!

82
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:06,801
Hello, Vanya.

83
00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:08,304
Adios, comrade.

84
00:05:08,305 --> 00:05:10,307
Vanya, what day
is today?

85
00:05:10,308 --> 00:05:11,474
Friday.

86
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:12,642
Already?

87
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:13,878
Yes.

88
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:16,149
That vodka must have been
stronger than I thought.

89
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,151
I am glad you are back,
Mr. Thompson.

90
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,653
You had a good time?

91
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:21,255
I must have,
if it's Friday.

92
00:05:23,993 --> 00:05:26,329
What's the news
around this fish trap?

93
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,966
Well, there's some good
news and some bad news.

94
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:31,170
Last week all the towels were stolen,

95
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:33,340
but on the other hand,
the water wasn't running,

96
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:35,008
so nobody
needed a towel.

97
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:36,177
Everything balances.

98
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:40,782
Who is this
strange figure?

99
00:05:40,783 --> 00:05:42,286
This is comrade
baronoff,

100
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:43,822
our new
hotel manager.

101
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:45,223
Oh! Oh.

102
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:48,361
The name is McKinley b.
Thompson of the Topeka bugle,

103
00:05:48,362 --> 00:05:50,397
your predecessor's
favorite journalist.

104
00:05:50,398 --> 00:05:52,800
Welcome to
our hotel, comrade.

105
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:54,202
Room 301.

106
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:55,505
Any mail
or telegrams?

107
00:05:55,506 --> 00:05:58,242
Mr. Baronoff,
I left my room 20 minutes ago.

108
00:05:58,243 --> 00:06:00,312
I just came back,
and my bed is gone.

109
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:01,813
Are you sure,
madam?

110
00:06:01,814 --> 00:06:04,083
Somebody has stolen
my bed, I tell you.

111
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:06,487
There's no sign
of a bed in my room.

112
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:11,327
The very idea of stealing
a bed right out of my room!

113
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:13,330
Maybe they wanted it
for the parade.

114
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,832
Kindly sit down,
madam.

115
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,035
We will solve your
situation in a few moments.

116
00:06:17,036 --> 00:06:19,238
It may not be necessary
to place you under arrest.

117
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:20,440
Arrest?!

118
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:21,742
You forgot
my key.

119
00:06:21,743 --> 00:06:23,845
I'm sorry.
There is no key for you.

120
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:26,682
The hotel is filled.
Your room is now occupied.

121
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:28,017
It is? A lady?

122
00:06:28,018 --> 00:06:29,019
No, sir.

123
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,387
Then throw him out.

124
00:06:30,388 --> 00:06:31,890
Please. The gentleman
occupying your room

125
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,194
is herr Von Hofer
of the German news agency.

126
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:36,196
He is special
from the Kremlin.

127
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:37,532
Hofer?
Good old Hofer!

128
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:39,234
Why didn't you say so?

129
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:40,669
Why, we're old pals.

130
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,373
It'll be fun bunking in with
old pretzel-head Hofer again.

131
00:06:43,374 --> 00:06:45,709
You're sure
there will be no trouble?

132
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,713
Trouble? Why, we're
practically honeymooners.

133
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:49,715
Oh, listen.
This is important.

134
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:54,322
I want the waiter to bring
me up one bottle of Brandy,

135
00:06:54,323 --> 00:06:56,959
one bottle of vodka,
two cucumbers,

136
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,196
three raw eggs,

137
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:01,733
and a small bottle
of tabasco.

138
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:03,202
Right away.

139
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:05,238
Delay will be fatal.

140
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:09,878
Madam, your problem
is solved.

141
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,416
You will sleep on this till
we recover the missing bed.

142
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:14,952
What?

143
00:07:14,953 --> 00:07:17,922
How long has the elevator
been stuck this time?

144
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:19,225
8 hours.

145
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:22,362
They are going to report it
to the bureau of elevators.

146
00:07:22,363 --> 00:07:23,865
What's the rush?

147
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:26,033
They think there are
some people in it.

148
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:28,204
What are they going
to do about it?

149
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:30,207
They are looking
for the engineer,

150
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,043
but nobody knows
where he is.

151
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:34,881
Personally, I think
he is in the elevator.

152
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:45,228
Here. Have this cleaned,
pressed, and deloused.

153
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:52,338
Mr. Thompson,
excuse me!

154
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:54,342
This is my room,
and I'm busy.

155
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:56,177
So am I.
Go right ahead,

156
00:07:56,178 --> 00:07:58,347
only don't holler so
loud when you dictate.

157
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:00,350
I got a head on me
like an incinerator.

158
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:02,152
Turn on the bath,
if it's working.

159
00:08:02,153 --> 00:08:03,821
Mr. Thompson,
this is my room,

160
00:08:03,822 --> 00:08:05,891
and I must ask you to
vacate, if you please!

161
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:07,360
That's a fine way
to talk.

162
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,030
I get this room,
I fix it up,

163
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,199
I pay for it in advance,
and I live in it.

164
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,235
You march in
and try to throw me out.

165
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:15,371
Is that a nice way for
a nazi to act? I ask you.

166
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:17,875
And I ask you for the
last time to leave my room!

167
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:19,210
Our room, old boy.

168
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:21,380
You can take the couch.
I'll take the bed.

169
00:08:23,384 --> 00:08:24,886
Excuse me,
Mr. Thompson.

170
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:27,388
How soon can I talk
to you alone?

171
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,225
You'll have to wait
till I'm alone, Vanya.

172
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:31,261
Thank you.

173
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:32,495
What's your name?

174
00:08:32,496 --> 00:08:33,632
Olga.

175
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:35,902
Ok, Olga. You can curl
up in the fireplace.

176
00:08:35,903 --> 00:08:37,737
That's Russia-everybody
shares everything.

177
00:08:37,738 --> 00:08:39,773
It is impossible for me to share a room

178
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:41,443
with an irresponsible American lout,

179
00:08:41,444 --> 00:08:42,911
a man who
is a disgrace

180
00:08:42,912 --> 00:08:44,914
to the profession
of journalism-

181
00:08:44,915 --> 00:08:46,917
shh! Hold it.
You hear that?

182
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:48,186
Hear what?

183
00:08:48,187 --> 00:08:50,422
The rats. They've been
nibbling away at this hotel

184
00:08:50,423 --> 00:08:52,358
ever since
comrade Lenin died.

185
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,627
There he is.

186
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:55,563
Look at him...
Licking his whiskers.

187
00:08:56,865 --> 00:08:59,869
What do you know?
I missed him.

188
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,372
That settles it!

189
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:04,409
I am going first
to the management,

190
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,380
next to the German embassy,
then to the Kremlin.

191
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,485
You will find
that it's not so easy

192
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:13,856
to take away the rights
from a German!

193
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:20,399
Well, it's great
to be home.

194
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,900
Good-bye.

195
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:23,403
Where are you going?

196
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:25,405
With Mr. Hofer.
I'm his secretary.

197
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:26,741
What's he pay you?

198
00:09:26,742 --> 00:09:28,076
200 rubles a week.

199
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:29,879
I'll give you
a hundred-cash.

200
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,880
Oh, thank you.
I'll take it.

201
00:09:31,883 --> 00:09:33,016
Ok, Snooks.

202
00:09:33,317 --> 00:09:36,421
Your first duty is to
relax and take it easy

203
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:38,958
while I jump
in the tub.

204
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,095
Hello. What's this?
Open house?

205
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:42,430
Where's Mr. Thompson?

206
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:44,766
He's washing himself
in a bathtub.

207
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,736
Sit down, please,
and wait.

208
00:09:49,941 --> 00:09:51,977
Hey, Mac,
hurry it up.

209
00:09:51,978 --> 00:09:54,448
Hello, Janey.
I'll be right out.

210
00:09:54,449 --> 00:09:56,451
Just heard
you were back.

211
00:09:56,452 --> 00:09:59,788
Our colleague Herr Von Hofer
is raising the roof downstairs.

212
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:01,423
Claims you
kicked him out.

213
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:02,759
That's a lie.

214
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,494
I started shooting
at some rats,

215
00:10:04,495 --> 00:10:06,298
and Von Hofer
took it personally.

216
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:08,301
Hello, Honeybun.
You miss me?

217
00:10:08,302 --> 00:10:10,472
Oh, I can always go to
the zoo when you're away.

218
00:10:10,473 --> 00:10:11,973
Oh, I got rivals,
huh?

219
00:10:16,513 --> 00:10:18,984
What's the idea of coming
in without knocking?

220
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,318
Excuse me.

221
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,988
Oh, here we are!

222
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,491
The greatest pick-me-up
known to man.

223
00:10:24,492 --> 00:10:27,495
You really missed something at
the Kremlin this morning, Mac.

224
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:29,365
Yeah? How is
the old Kremlin?

225
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:32,803
Same old rat trap. Full of stuffed
shirts double-crossing the masses.

226
00:10:32,804 --> 00:10:34,672
Someday the people
are going to get wise

227
00:10:34,673 --> 00:10:36,441
and take it apart
brick by brick.

228
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:39,012
Excuse me. You wish to pay for this?

229
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,547
Yeah. How much?

230
00:10:40,548 --> 00:10:42,016
230 rubles.

231
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,019
What are you
talking about?

232
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,023
Two bottles
at 15 rubles apiece.

233
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:47,524
What's the 200 for?

234
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:51,029
That's for me so I am not
telling the secret police

235
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,966
how the lady talked
about the Kremlin.

236
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,973
Well, I guess
it's cheap, at that.

237
00:10:57,974 --> 00:10:59,474
Here you are, Palsie.

238
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:01,978
Lucky thing for me
you can't read my mind.

239
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:03,447
You'd be a millionaire.

240
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:06,284
I am very happy!
Thank you.

241
00:11:07,987 --> 00:11:10,992
Well, I pulled you
out of that hole, Jane.

242
00:11:10,993 --> 00:11:12,160
Thanks.

243
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:14,163
Well, to get back
to the Kremlin,

244
00:11:14,164 --> 00:11:16,533
in case you want some more
news you can't send out,

245
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:18,335
they've bumped off
good old commissar Molkoff.

246
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:20,504
You don't say.
Any particular reason?

247
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:23,876
They got mad on him because
he failed to dig up Comrade X.

248
00:11:23,877 --> 00:11:25,179
Who's batting
for Molkoff?

249
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,947
The head bogeyman-
Vasiliev.

250
00:11:26,948 --> 00:11:29,551
Oh, old apple cheeks,
huh?

251
00:11:29,552 --> 00:11:32,021
You, uh, figure
he erased Molkoff?

252
00:11:32,022 --> 00:11:33,557
No doubt of it.

253
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:37,896
Shot his old pal in the back, and
today he'll cry over his grave.

254
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,034
Yeah? When?

255
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:42,536
3:00.

256
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:43,971
Where?

257
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:45,440
At the Kapulski cemetery.

258
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:46,675
Why?

259
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:49,512
Every time they put a new
liberator in the ground,

260
00:11:49,513 --> 00:11:51,549
they throw another
banquet-free.

261
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,987
Vodka, shashlik, caviar,
stuffed goose, and more vodka.

262
00:11:54,988 --> 00:11:57,023
Fine talk from
McKinley b. Thompson.

263
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:58,993
Honestly,
you make me sick.

264
00:11:58,994 --> 00:12:02,831
Two years ago I looked up to you as
the best reporter in the business,

265
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:04,268
and now look at you.

266
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:06,638
Face the facts, baby. There
ain't no news in Russia.

267
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,939
Ok, Mac.

268
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,942
I never minded
anything you did,

269
00:12:09,943 --> 00:12:12,713
not even when you
waltzed out on me in Tokyo

270
00:12:12,714 --> 00:12:14,581
for a bowlegged
geisha girl.

271
00:12:14,582 --> 00:12:16,217
She loved me.

272
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:19,756
But I just can't get used to you
as a no-good, incompetent party boy.

273
00:12:19,757 --> 00:12:22,059
Mr. Thompson,
you lied to me.

274
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,029
Herr Von Hofer
told me everything.

275
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,032
You're not
like honeymooners.

276
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:27,367
He despises you.

277
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:29,403
Honeymooners. Ha!
Get out of here!

278
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:31,039
See? Please
to get out.

279
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,042
Nobody's getting out
of anywhere!

280
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,045
Now, listen, you pretzel
duster. This is my room.

281
00:12:37,082 --> 00:12:38,283
Hello.

282
00:12:38,284 --> 00:12:39,818
Yes.

283
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:43,391
Mr. Thompson, if I came up to
see you now, would you be alone?

284
00:12:43,392 --> 00:12:44,425
What's that?

285
00:12:44,426 --> 00:12:45,894
Germany what?

286
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:49,098
You don't say!

287
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:50,400
Tanks, huh?

288
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:51,502
When?

289
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:53,704
I see.

290
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:55,173
Hmm!

291
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,077
I don't understand...

292
00:12:57,078 --> 00:12:59,012
You're surprised?
I'm knocked flat!

293
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:00,381
Holy ike!
Thanks.

294
00:13:00,382 --> 00:13:01,616
What is it?

295
00:13:01,617 --> 00:13:03,185
Germany just
declared war on Russia.

296
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:05,455
10 tank divisions just
moved into the ukraine,

297
00:13:05,456 --> 00:13:07,557
and schnitzel puss there
never told us a word about it.

298
00:13:07,558 --> 00:13:08,860
Who was that
speaking?

299
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:09,928
American embassy.

300
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:11,998
Lieber himmel.

301
00:13:16,038 --> 00:13:18,340
German dog!
Out!

302
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,246
Get your hands off me,
you Russian dog!

303
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:24,048
Outside, before
I kill you!

304
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:17,744
I thought
you might need me.

305
00:15:20,616 --> 00:15:23,119
You thought right.

306
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,855
Come over here.

307
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,596
It's nice of you to take
such good care of me.

308
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,138
You're, uh... not a
bad-looking girl, are you?

309
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:38,108
Let's get
a better look at you.

310
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:39,943
My glasses! Please,
Mr. Thompson.

311
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:41,779
You won't need
glasses for this.

312
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,283
How about a drink to cement
a beautiful friendship?

313
00:15:44,284 --> 00:15:45,784
I can't see anything.

314
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:47,120
Please, Mr. Thompson.

315
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:48,656
Come here.

316
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:51,661
I do not wish to be
a silly bourgeois girl,

317
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:55,432
but you're going a little bit
too fast for me, Mr. Thompson.

318
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:58,403
The 5-year plan is all
right for certain things,

319
00:15:58,404 --> 00:16:00,072
but not for this.

320
00:16:00,073 --> 00:16:01,475
Is this glass full?

321
00:16:01,476 --> 00:16:03,611
Yeah. That's the way
you drink it.

322
00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:05,246
It's got
cucumbers in it.

323
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:06,582
Like borscht!

324
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,083
American borscht.

325
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:10,086
I made it myself.

326
00:16:10,087 --> 00:16:13,090
Maybe you're
playing jokes on me.

327
00:16:13,091 --> 00:16:15,595
Let's change glasses.
Do you mind?

328
00:16:15,596 --> 00:16:18,465
I've never seen a Russian
yet that wasn't suspicious.

329
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:19,734
It's pathetic.

330
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:26,343
It's better
than borscht.

331
00:16:27,947 --> 00:16:29,181
I like it.

332
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:34,121
I can't see
any cucumbers.

333
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:37,659
You'll see them
in a minute.

334
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,964
I love
Americans best.

335
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:45,137
Yeah. Yeah. That's one thing
you got to hand Americans-

336
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,639
they're perfect.

337
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,808
Perfect!

338
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:50,178
What does that mean,
perfect? Nothing.

339
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:54,584
America is perfect,
but Russia is better.

340
00:16:54,585 --> 00:16:57,087
Why? You ask.

341
00:16:57,088 --> 00:17:00,592
Because Russia
has a soul.

342
00:17:00,593 --> 00:17:03,596
And what
is this soul?

343
00:17:03,597 --> 00:17:07,002
It is suffering
and beauty.

344
00:17:08,905 --> 00:17:11,641
You don't
understand.

345
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:13,878
You've
never suffered.

346
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:17,649
Comrade, I want
some more borscht.

347
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,085
Help yourself.

348
00:18:43,976 --> 00:18:45,376
Excuse me.

349
00:18:45,377 --> 00:18:48,046
Hang it up,
will you?

350
00:19:03,168 --> 00:19:05,037
Oh, Mr. Thompson!

351
00:19:06,641 --> 00:19:11,146
Please, Mr. Thompson. I'd like
to talk to you alone, in private.

352
00:19:11,147 --> 00:19:12,548
Ok, Vanya.

353
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:18,991
I like
Americans best.

354
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:23,297
Ha ha! Hee hee!

355
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:24,632
Ahh!

356
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:27,469
Ha ha ha!

357
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:31,709
Excuse me.

358
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,048
I don't want her to hear
what I got to say.

359
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,717
She's a spy.

360
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,719
Yeah, I know.
Everybody's a spy.

361
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,688
That's why
I like you, Vanya.

362
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:42,691
You're too dumb
to be a spy.

363
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:44,193
Thank you.

364
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:46,731
Mr. Thompson, you never met my daughter?

365
00:19:46,732 --> 00:19:49,368
No. I never had
the pleasure, Vanya.

366
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:51,704
Oh, I love her.

367
00:19:51,705 --> 00:19:55,176
What's the matter?
In trouble?

368
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:57,179
She is
in terrible danger.

369
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,183
I'm sorry
to hear that.

370
00:19:59,184 --> 00:20:02,187
What's she done?

371
00:20:02,188 --> 00:20:04,490
She is a communist.

372
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:07,727
You don't say.

373
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:10,098
I thought they were
allowed in Russia.

374
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:12,668
Oh, the worst thing
you can be.

375
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,205
At first,
they were very popular.

376
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:17,241
They killed everybody.

377
00:20:17,242 --> 00:20:21,214
But now we have in Russia
a double situation.

378
00:20:21,215 --> 00:20:26,221
The communists have ideals, but they
found out you can't run a government

379
00:20:26,222 --> 00:20:28,724
with everybody
going around having ideals.

380
00:20:28,725 --> 00:20:31,261
So what is happening?

381
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:35,901
The communists are being executed
so that communism should succeed.

382
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,269
Yeah. I know.

383
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,341
They keep it up long enough,
it'll be a great country.

384
00:20:40,342 --> 00:20:43,078
My daughter refuses
to give up her ideals.

385
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:46,450
Any day, she might
be dead, Mr. Thompson-

386
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:48,152
her and her ideals together.

387
00:20:48,153 --> 00:20:50,255
I wouldn't worry
too much, Vanya.

388
00:20:50,256 --> 00:20:53,193
There are lots of russians
that haven't been shot.

389
00:20:53,194 --> 00:20:54,662
Oh, not my golubka.

390
00:20:54,663 --> 00:20:56,664
The minute they
ask her questions,

391
00:20:56,665 --> 00:20:59,668
she will make a speech,
and they shoot her.

392
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:02,672
What do you want me
to do, muzzle her?

393
00:21:02,673 --> 00:21:03,841
No.

394
00:21:03,842 --> 00:21:07,046
You must take her out
of Russia, Mr. Thompson.

395
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:10,184
That is the only way
to save her life.

396
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:14,023
Well, I'm sorry, pal, but I
don't happen to be leaving Russia.

397
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:15,758
Yes, you do.

398
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:18,229
That's what
I'm telling you.

399
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,366
You are going to take her
out of Russia tonight.

400
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,874
You're cuckoo, Vanya.

401
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:31,048
Mr. Thompson, you are forcing
me to tell you something.

402
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:38,257
What are you doing
with that radio, Vanya?

403
00:21:38,258 --> 00:21:41,261
Cameras are forbidden
in Moscow.

404
00:21:41,262 --> 00:21:43,264
So what?

405
00:21:43,265 --> 00:21:45,768
So this is a camera.

406
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:51,743
Ok.

407
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,714
What else you got
on your mind?

408
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:56,817
I know who you are.

409
00:21:59,222 --> 00:22:01,224
I'll bite, Vanya.

410
00:22:01,225 --> 00:22:03,260
Who am I?

411
00:22:03,261 --> 00:22:06,530
Mr. Thompson,
you are Comrade X.

412
00:22:08,268 --> 00:22:09,669
You don't say.

413
00:22:13,242 --> 00:22:16,245
Who put this horrible
idea in your head, Vanya?

414
00:22:16,246 --> 00:22:20,183
Kill me, Mr. Thompson.
It won't do you any good,

415
00:22:20,184 --> 00:22:23,221
because if you kill me,
you have still got mitka.

416
00:22:24,992 --> 00:22:27,261
Mitka?
Who is mitka?

417
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,796
He's my friend.

418
00:22:28,797 --> 00:22:30,766
He's waiting
by the telephone now.

419
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:34,438
We arranged that if I
don't call him up by 9:00

420
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:38,144
and tell him you are
going to do what we want,

421
00:22:38,145 --> 00:22:40,213
he'll go to
the police quick.

422
00:22:40,214 --> 00:22:43,685
And what will this stooge pal
of yours tell the police, Vanya?

423
00:22:43,686 --> 00:22:45,286
Everything.

424
00:22:45,287 --> 00:22:49,326
About the things I find in your
pockets when I am pressing your pants

425
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:50,961
and about
that handkerchief.

426
00:22:50,962 --> 00:22:52,564
What handkerchief?

427
00:22:52,565 --> 00:22:55,001
He will show them
your handkerchief,

428
00:22:55,002 --> 00:22:58,939
the one that has always ink
on it and that has holes in it,

429
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,611
and he will show them how,
if you put that handkerchief

430
00:23:02,612 --> 00:23:04,748
over the stories
you send to america,

431
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:06,284
comes out
something different-

432
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:09,788
comes out stories
by Comrade X.

433
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:15,296
That's why you are going to take
my daughter out of Russia tonight,

434
00:23:15,297 --> 00:23:17,467
Mr. Comrade X!

435
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:30,185
Ok, flea face.

436
00:23:30,186 --> 00:23:32,388
How much for you,
and how much for mitka?

437
00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:35,291
No, no, no, no.
I don't want money.

438
00:23:35,292 --> 00:23:37,995
I want you
to save my daughter.

439
00:23:37,996 --> 00:23:42,435
Mr. Thompson, I don't want
you to die, but what can I do?

440
00:23:42,436 --> 00:23:44,105
I'm a father.

441
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:45,640
Where is this mitka?

442
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:48,110
He's waiting
by the telephone now.

443
00:23:48,111 --> 00:23:49,311
What telephone?

444
00:23:49,312 --> 00:23:50,847
No, no,
Mr. Thompson.

445
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:53,351
Do what you want.
I will never tell.

446
00:23:53,352 --> 00:23:56,122
Listen, Vanya, if i'm
going to do this thing,

447
00:23:56,123 --> 00:23:58,225
I've got to know
who this mitka is.

448
00:23:58,226 --> 00:23:59,660
I'll tell you what.

449
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:02,097
Tell him to come over here,
and we'll all have a conference.

450
00:24:02,098 --> 00:24:04,100
This is a big job.
I need his help.

451
00:24:04,101 --> 00:24:05,701
He sounds like
a bright fella.

452
00:24:05,702 --> 00:24:07,104
No, Mr. Thompson.

453
00:24:07,105 --> 00:24:08,772
What do
you mean, no?

454
00:24:08,773 --> 00:24:11,277
In 10 minutes,
all will be over.

455
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:13,280
What will be over?

456
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:15,950
You, me, golubka-
everything.

457
00:24:15,951 --> 00:24:19,087
In 10 minutes, mitka
will be by the police.

458
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:24,095
You bumble-head maniac.

459
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:28,669
Well, ok. You win.

460
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:32,106
If I take her out, you'll call it quits
- you and mitka?

461
00:24:32,107 --> 00:24:33,308
Yes.

462
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:35,044
Does she want
to get out?

463
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:37,582
Oh, no!
She loves Russia.

464
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:39,317
That's fine.

465
00:24:39,318 --> 00:24:41,353
Where is she now?

466
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,423
She is on the streetcar.

467
00:24:43,424 --> 00:24:45,493
Tell her to come
and see me.

468
00:24:45,494 --> 00:24:47,127
She can't leave the car.

469
00:24:47,128 --> 00:24:48,330
Why not?

470
00:24:48,331 --> 00:24:49,999
She is a motorman.

471
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,803
So the deal is, I get an
obstinate lady motorman

472
00:24:52,804 --> 00:24:55,807
out of a country she
doesn't want to leave.

473
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,775
Yes.

474
00:24:58,311 --> 00:25:00,280
Well, ok.
Call him up.

475
00:25:02,785 --> 00:25:04,787
What shall
I tell mitka?

476
00:25:04,788 --> 00:25:07,324
You can tell him
that McKinley b. Thompson

477
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:11,296
is the biggest horse's neck that
ever had a can tied to his tail.

478
00:25:11,297 --> 00:25:12,497
Holy ike.

479
00:25:12,498 --> 00:25:14,300
After outwitting
the whole Russian police,

480
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:17,405
I end up taking orders from two
of the dumbest muscovites on earth.

481
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,219
There she is.
Stop!

482
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,322
She'll only stop
for a second.

483
00:25:56,128 --> 00:25:57,263
Hello, baby.

484
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,821
I don't like to stand here
bothering you like this

485
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:18,826
when you're so busy, golubka,
but I want to talk to you.

486
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,862
My name is Theodore.

487
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:22,833
You don't look like
Theodore to me.

488
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:25,336
I was named
at the workers' council.

489
00:26:25,337 --> 00:26:27,338
Somebody didn't have
his glasses on.

490
00:26:27,339 --> 00:26:29,341
It is not glasses.
It is the law.

491
00:26:29,342 --> 00:26:31,311
Streetcars must be
driven by males.

492
00:26:31,312 --> 00:26:32,846
That's why
they changed me.

493
00:26:32,847 --> 00:26:34,950
I'm glad they didn't
graft a beard on you.

494
00:26:34,951 --> 00:26:37,553
Ok. If you want
to be Theodore.

495
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,390
You were
with my father?

496
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:41,860
That's right.
He's a friend of mine.

497
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:44,864
He thinks because I'm running
a streetcar he can ride free-

498
00:26:44,865 --> 00:26:46,399
he and his friends.

499
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,037
You will have to pay.
20 kopecks, please.

500
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:51,240
Put in here.

501
00:27:03,725 --> 00:27:06,327
Ah, Russia.

502
00:27:06,328 --> 00:27:08,330
What is the matter
with it?

503
00:27:08,331 --> 00:27:10,333
I'm saying
good-bye to it.

504
00:27:10,334 --> 00:27:13,337
It's like saying good-bye
to a woman you love,

505
00:27:13,338 --> 00:27:15,208
never going to
see again.

506
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:16,543
You love Russia?

507
00:27:16,544 --> 00:27:18,179
Oh, it's my whole life.

508
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,481
You know, I said
to your father,

509
00:27:20,482 --> 00:27:23,351
"Vanya, I want to spend
my last night in Russia

510
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:25,354
on a streetcar
among the masses."

511
00:27:25,355 --> 00:27:26,890
That's why I'm here.

512
00:27:26,891 --> 00:27:28,359
You're an American.

513
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,630
Please. Please. I don't
want to think of that now.

514
00:27:31,631 --> 00:27:34,101
I read in the pravda
10 million people

515
00:27:34,102 --> 00:27:36,537
starved to death last
winter in the united states,

516
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:38,507
and there was nobody
to Bury them.

517
00:27:38,508 --> 00:27:40,008
Bury them?

518
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:42,246
They don't Bury people in the
united states. They burn them.

519
00:27:42,247 --> 00:27:43,815
Nation of thieves.

520
00:27:43,816 --> 00:27:46,919
Yes. Yes. That's what
I'm going back to.

521
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,423
Ever hear of
the Brooklyn Dodgers?

522
00:27:49,424 --> 00:27:50,724
No.

523
00:27:50,725 --> 00:27:52,660
They get murdered
every day.

524
00:27:52,661 --> 00:27:54,030
Murdered? What for?

525
00:27:54,031 --> 00:27:55,999
For making
some little errors.

526
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,603
There must be a
revolution soon in america.

527
00:27:58,604 --> 00:28:00,572
No. You can't
have a revolution

528
00:28:00,573 --> 00:28:04,344
with people who believe in
hot dogs and boogie-woogie.

529
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:18,330
Excuse, please.

530
00:28:26,877 --> 00:28:29,380
I know what you're
thinking of, comrade.

531
00:28:29,381 --> 00:28:32,384
You're thinking you will
never see this again.

532
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:34,822
Never.

533
00:28:36,926 --> 00:28:39,395
It is
a beautiful night.

534
00:28:39,396 --> 00:28:40,896
You like nature?

535
00:28:40,897 --> 00:28:43,935
Do you have to
take it back right away?

536
00:28:43,936 --> 00:28:45,102
Who?

537
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:46,405
The streetcar.

538
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:48,908
Oh, him. Rubick
takes him back.

539
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:50,911
You are
in a hurry?

540
00:28:50,912 --> 00:28:53,882
Well, I got to leave
in the morning.

541
00:28:53,883 --> 00:28:56,886
Come. We'll wait
for rubick together.

542
00:28:56,887 --> 00:28:58,856
Comrade,
please don't be sad.

543
00:28:58,857 --> 00:29:02,895
There is so much to live
for, even in america.

544
00:29:02,896 --> 00:29:05,832
Careful, please!
It is full of holes.

545
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:09,872
The problem of taking away the masses

546
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,408
from boogie-woogie
is a difficult one.

547
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:13,878
Yes, it is.

548
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:16,147
You're thinking
of that?

549
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:19,886
What I was
thinking is, uh...

550
00:29:19,887 --> 00:29:23,424
Why don't you come
to america with me?

551
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:25,928
Yes. I was thinking
of that, too.

552
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:27,063
You were?

553
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:29,066
I feel sorry
for america.

554
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,068
I would like
to help it.

555
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,404
You could.

556
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:34,908
Yes. I could help those
people in Brooklyn.

557
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:36,409
What is their name?

558
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,945
The-the Dodgers.

559
00:29:37,946 --> 00:29:39,916
Ah.
I could help them.

560
00:29:39,917 --> 00:29:41,918
Theodore,
I made up my mind.

561
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,957
You'd do more good for communism in
america than anyone since Columbus.

562
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,458
No.

563
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:48,961
What do you mean, no?

564
00:29:48,962 --> 00:29:50,429
I cannot
leave Russia.

565
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,932
Karl Marx left Russia.

566
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:53,969
He was never
in Russia.

567
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,971
Ahem.
That's what I mean.

568
00:29:55,972 --> 00:29:57,440
Oh, I see.

569
00:29:57,441 --> 00:29:59,443
You'd be better than Karl
Marx. You're prettier.

570
00:29:59,444 --> 00:30:01,947
Oh, you're-you're
making fun of me.

571
00:30:01,948 --> 00:30:04,984
No. I'm just speaking from
a practical point of view.

572
00:30:04,985 --> 00:30:07,956
You know what's been wrong with
communist propaganda in america?

573
00:30:07,957 --> 00:30:09,791
What can be wrong
with it?

574
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:12,461
Too many cross-eyed people
with whiskers peddling it.

575
00:30:12,462 --> 00:30:14,497
Oh, you mean
intellectuals.

576
00:30:14,498 --> 00:30:16,500
That's right. Comrade,
it's an inspiration.

577
00:30:16,501 --> 00:30:18,135
What is?

578
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:22,476
One beautiful girl with the smile of
an angel whispering "I love Russia"

579
00:30:22,477 --> 00:30:25,513
is worth a whole wagonload
of intellectuals.

580
00:30:25,514 --> 00:30:26,983
Beauty is nothing.

581
00:30:26,984 --> 00:30:28,985
Yes, yes. I agree
with you, comrade.

582
00:30:28,986 --> 00:30:32,491
I have no use for beauty in
a woman... uh, to speak of...

583
00:30:32,492 --> 00:30:34,526
Unless she is
full of ideals.

584
00:30:34,527 --> 00:30:37,497
Why, a woman like you
could use her beauty-

585
00:30:37,498 --> 00:30:40,001
not to enslave fools,
but to set men free.

586
00:30:40,002 --> 00:30:42,037
What is
your proposition?

587
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:46,511
Well, I say we go together
and work for the cause.

588
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:50,516
Would you want me to
go as a motorman?

589
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,986
No. As a woman.

590
00:30:52,987 --> 00:30:54,956
There.
That's what I mean.

591
00:30:54,957 --> 00:30:57,459
That's what the cause
in america needs,

592
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,462
just what you're
doing right now.

593
00:30:59,463 --> 00:31:01,132
What am I doing?

594
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:02,633
Smiling.

595
00:31:02,634 --> 00:31:05,504
There's nothing you couldn't
sell with a smile like that.

596
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:07,006
What do you say?

597
00:31:07,007 --> 00:31:11,479
You are the first American
I've ever met with a soul.

598
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,451
It has a strange
effect on me.

599
00:31:19,526 --> 00:31:20,993
You're right.

600
00:31:20,994 --> 00:31:23,496
American men
are usually all alike,

601
00:31:23,497 --> 00:31:25,667
all interested
in only one thing.

602
00:31:25,668 --> 00:31:27,002
Money.

603
00:31:27,003 --> 00:31:28,671
Worse than that.

604
00:31:28,672 --> 00:31:30,540
Ahem. The, uh...

605
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:34,045
The rights of the masses
mean nothing to them.

606
00:31:34,046 --> 00:31:36,047
Like animals
without souls.

607
00:31:36,048 --> 00:31:39,020
Yes. Why, over there,
men look on women as...

608
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:42,524
As just toys to have
fun with, nothing more-

609
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:47,565
not to exchange views on economics
with and things like that.

610
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:49,033
That's awful.

611
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:53,474
Makes me feel sad.

612
00:31:53,475 --> 00:31:55,509
Me, too.

613
00:32:07,495 --> 00:32:09,529
The blue fairy.

614
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,532
Ahem. Where were we?

615
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:15,505
I was just saying I could
do a lot of good in america.

616
00:32:15,506 --> 00:32:17,473
Yes. So you were.

617
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:22,715
Hey! Wait a
minute! Tell him to stop.

618
00:32:22,716 --> 00:32:24,050
Hey!

619
00:32:24,051 --> 00:32:25,051
Why?

620
00:32:25,052 --> 00:32:26,554
So we can
ride back with him.

621
00:32:26,555 --> 00:32:29,057
But officials are not
allowed to ride in streetcars.

622
00:32:29,058 --> 00:32:30,526
That's what
makes graft.

623
00:32:30,527 --> 00:32:31,528
What?

624
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:33,030
We will walk.

625
00:32:33,031 --> 00:32:35,033
To Moscow?
That's 7 miles!

626
00:32:35,034 --> 00:32:39,539
What does it matter? We
have so much to talk about.

627
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,542
Ah, I'm so happy.

628
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:44,046
Comrade, have you
read basaroff's book

629
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:46,049
the iron law
of overproduction?

630
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,051
No. I don't think so.

631
00:32:48,052 --> 00:32:49,554
I'm glad.

632
00:32:49,555 --> 00:32:53,492
I will recite it to you so
you won't have to read it.

633
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:55,495
The first chapter
of basaroff's book

634
00:32:55,496 --> 00:32:57,165
is called
"dark clouds."

635
00:32:57,166 --> 00:32:59,167
It begins like this.

636
00:32:59,168 --> 00:33:01,370
"The dead fingers
of capitalism

637
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:03,540
"are slowly
relaxing their hold

638
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:06,044
"on the throat
of world production,

639
00:33:06,045 --> 00:33:08,514
but we must not
rejoice too soon..."

640
00:33:08,515 --> 00:33:13,020
Now, chapter 14 takes up the
secrets of international banking

641
00:33:13,021 --> 00:33:16,359
and its menace
to world reform.

642
00:33:18,195 --> 00:33:21,065
What's the matter?
Go on. Chapter 14.

643
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:23,034
You're tired.
You're not listening.

644
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:24,537
I heard every word.

645
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:27,475
No, comrade. Tomorrow night, chapter 14.

646
00:33:27,476 --> 00:33:28,876
Where are you going?

647
00:33:28,877 --> 00:33:30,246
I live here.

648
00:33:30,247 --> 00:33:31,680
I'm leaving
tomorrow.

649
00:33:31,681 --> 00:33:33,550
We haven't time to separate
if you're coming with me.

650
00:33:33,551 --> 00:33:35,552
There's a lot
of work to do.

651
00:33:35,553 --> 00:33:39,092
Oh, I see. Well, if we
must hurry, I'll hurry.

652
00:33:41,596 --> 00:33:44,065
I go pack my suitcase.
You wait here.

653
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:45,567
Ok. Hurry up.

654
00:33:51,076 --> 00:33:53,512
Hey, hurry up,
will you, comrade?

655
00:33:53,513 --> 00:33:56,016
I advise you to
go home to your hotel.

656
00:33:56,017 --> 00:33:58,819
Later, it gets very cold
here on the steps.

657
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:01,056
Well, that's a fine
Russian trick.

658
00:34:01,057 --> 00:34:04,028
Comrade, all I know of you is that
you're a friend of my father's,

659
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:05,362
who is a child.

660
00:34:05,363 --> 00:34:07,532
If you think I've been
lying to you all this time,

661
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:09,035
why don't you
say so?

662
00:34:09,036 --> 00:34:12,039
What I say is that
you're making me suspicious.

663
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,043
You're a stranger who gets
on my streetcar, kisses me,

664
00:34:15,044 --> 00:34:18,014
and wants me to leave
Russia with him tonight.

665
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:19,115
No.

666
00:34:19,116 --> 00:34:22,086
I intend to investigate you
from every angle.

667
00:34:22,087 --> 00:34:24,389
Now I say go home.
Good night.

668
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:47,589
Mr. Thompson.

669
00:34:49,626 --> 00:34:51,628
Oh, hello.
I'm glad to see you.

670
00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:54,032
Vanya, we're all set.
Your troubles are over.

671
00:34:54,033 --> 00:34:56,570
Your daughter is waiting
for me at the airport.

672
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:58,538
Wonderful girl. I'm very
grateful to you, Vanya.

673
00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:00,541
Never expected a motorman
to turn out so pretty.

674
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:02,578
You were all wrong
about her being stubborn.

675
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:04,046
She's rarin' to go.

676
00:35:04,047 --> 00:35:05,548
We're leaving
on the first plane.

677
00:35:05,549 --> 00:35:07,551
She asked me to say
good-bye to you for her.

678
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:09,554
Mr. Thompson,
you are lying.

679
00:35:09,555 --> 00:35:12,058
You don't think I'd lie
about a thing like this

680
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:14,094
when I know how important it is to you?

681
00:35:14,095 --> 00:35:16,064
Mitka has told me
by the telephone.

682
00:35:16,065 --> 00:35:17,599
Told you what?

683
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,569
Everything-how she
slammed the door on you.

684
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,107
Mr. Thompson,
you must try again.

685
00:35:23,108 --> 00:35:25,110
All right,
I'm lying.

686
00:35:25,111 --> 00:35:28,081
You got a lopheaded witch for a
daughter, and you can keep her.

687
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:30,584
Mr. Thompson, you are
going to murder my daughter.

688
00:35:30,585 --> 00:35:33,121
Oh, stop talking through
that fur hat of yours.

689
00:35:33,122 --> 00:35:34,623
I'm murdering
nobody.

690
00:35:34,624 --> 00:35:36,593
She's twice as
cuckoo as you!

691
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:39,097
I did everything I
could, but she won't go.

692
00:35:39,098 --> 00:35:40,598
You are killing her.

693
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:45,138
You are going away alone and
leaving her behind to die!

694
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:49,612
No, Mr. Thompson. You will
never get out of Russia alive.

695
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:51,614
I'm your friend,
Mr. Thompson.

696
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:54,051
Yes, I am your friend,

697
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:59,058
but I will not let you murder
my daughter, Mr. Thompson.

698
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:01,061
Hey, where
are you going?

699
00:36:01,062 --> 00:36:03,098
I've got some pants
to press.

700
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:05,067
Oh, no. No, you don't.

701
00:36:05,068 --> 00:36:08,104
Go on, kill me. That
won't do you any good.

702
00:36:08,105 --> 00:36:11,610
If mitka doesn't hear from
me within a half an hour,

703
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:13,579
he will go
to the police.

704
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,416
A half an hour, huh?

705
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:17,586
Come on, papa.
I'm going to tie you up

706
00:36:17,587 --> 00:36:19,622
and stuff that
big mouth of yours.

707
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:23,594
Aha! You hear?
That is mitka now.

708
00:36:26,632 --> 00:36:29,536
Come on. Get back in that
corner and keep your mouth shut.

709
00:36:33,141 --> 00:36:34,209
Come in.

710
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:37,280
Hello. I made
the investigation.

711
00:36:37,281 --> 00:36:40,084
Oh. Well, ok.
Come in.

712
00:36:42,155 --> 00:36:45,158
Comrade, you're perfect.
Bastakoff told me.

713
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:47,127
Oh. Well,
who's Bastakoff?

714
00:36:47,128 --> 00:36:50,666
He's the man I love more
than anybody in the world.

715
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:53,603
Mm-hmm. And he says it's
ok for you to go with me?

716
00:36:53,604 --> 00:36:55,573
Yes. He has
a great soul.

717
00:36:55,574 --> 00:36:56,576
Hmm. Yes.
I like him, too.

718
00:36:56,577 --> 00:36:59,046
How could you help it?
He's so sweet.

719
00:37:00,215 --> 00:37:02,083
Hello, father-
my little child.

720
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:03,786
Golubka...

721
00:37:03,787 --> 00:37:06,623
Speak English, father. We have a guest.

722
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:07,892
Comrade...

723
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,094
He was wonderful!

724
00:37:09,095 --> 00:37:10,095
Bastakoff?

725
00:37:10,096 --> 00:37:11,631
Yes.

726
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:14,134
This fellow Bastakoff isn't
coming along, by any chance, is he?

727
00:37:14,135 --> 00:37:15,937
Oh, no.
He's too busy.

728
00:37:15,938 --> 00:37:17,139
Doing what?

729
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,107
Oh, everything.
He knows everything, too.

730
00:37:19,108 --> 00:37:21,111
When I finished talking about
you, he took me in his arms

731
00:37:21,112 --> 00:37:23,114
and said, "Theodore, you
have ideals. Follow them!"

732
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,649
Oh, a brush-off, huh?

733
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,651
What?

734
00:37:25,652 --> 00:37:26,953
Skip it. You packed?

735
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:29,156
I took only my motorman's uniform along,

736
00:37:29,157 --> 00:37:31,659
in case we want
a war from within.

737
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:35,198
Excuse me. As a father,
may I ask what is going on?

738
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,134
Nothing that
concerns you.

739
00:37:37,135 --> 00:37:38,669
I'm getting married.

740
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,139
What do you mean,
married? To who?

741
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,842
To you, comrade.
Who else?

742
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,679
Oh, this is the happiest
day of my life!

743
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,148
I have a son!

744
00:37:47,149 --> 00:37:48,684
Control yourself,
Vanya.

745
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:50,152
I've had a tough day.

746
00:37:50,153 --> 00:37:53,091
Now, listen, Theodore,
I wasn't figuring on marriage.

747
00:37:53,092 --> 00:37:55,593
Lucky for you I am
the practical one.

748
00:37:55,594 --> 00:37:57,096
We must get married.

749
00:37:57,097 --> 00:38:00,101
It is the only way we can get
permission to leave Russia.

750
00:38:00,102 --> 00:38:02,104
What? You leave Russia?
For where?

751
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:03,639
To america.

752
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,111
You're leaving your father like this
- alone, without anybody?

753
00:38:07,112 --> 00:38:10,115
Oh, I should live
to see this black day!

754
00:38:10,116 --> 00:38:12,652
Golubka, you're
breaking my heart!

755
00:38:12,653 --> 00:38:14,655
Yes, yes. Ok, Vanya.

756
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:17,625
If that's the way you feel,
she don't go.

757
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:20,629
Oh, no, Mr. Thompson.
You misunderstand me.

758
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,132
I'm crying with joy.

759
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,135
Pay no attention
to my father.

760
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:28,174
He has no soul, no brain,
no ideals. He's a nobody.

761
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:31,178
I'm less than a nobody.
I'm a nothing.

762
00:38:31,179 --> 00:38:34,182
20 years we have been educating
Russia, and what do you know?

763
00:38:34,183 --> 00:38:36,185
Nothing.
Less than a baby.

764
00:38:36,186 --> 00:38:38,155
I only know
how to be a father,

765
00:38:38,156 --> 00:38:40,158
but this I knew
under the czar, too.

766
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,660
Look here, Theodore.

767
00:38:41,661 --> 00:38:43,863
Just when were you
figuring on this marriage?

768
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:45,198
Tonight.

769
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,201
Isn't it a little late?

770
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:49,171
No, Mr. Thompson.
That's all right.

771
00:38:49,172 --> 00:38:51,173
The marriage bureau
keeps open till 1 A.M.

772
00:38:51,174 --> 00:38:54,312
Statistics show that people
want to get married at night

773
00:38:54,313 --> 00:38:55,914
more than
in the morning.

774
00:39:05,663 --> 00:39:08,132
Uh, you, uh,
don't feel nervous?

775
00:39:08,133 --> 00:39:09,467
What about?

776
00:39:09,468 --> 00:39:11,136
Marrying a stranger.

777
00:39:11,137 --> 00:39:13,171
This is nothing
new to me.

778
00:39:13,172 --> 00:39:14,807
I married
strangers before.

779
00:39:14,808 --> 00:39:16,175
Oh?

780
00:39:16,176 --> 00:39:17,678
Uh, how many?

781
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:19,281
Only two.

782
00:39:20,684 --> 00:39:23,186
I don't want to
seem inquisitive,

783
00:39:23,187 --> 00:39:25,690
but, uh, what did you
do with them?

784
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:27,659
Oh, I sent back
the postal cards.

785
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,695
Oh.
Playing post office?

786
00:39:29,696 --> 00:39:31,164
You do not
understand, comrade.

787
00:39:31,165 --> 00:39:34,202
When you get married, you
are given a postal card.

788
00:39:34,203 --> 00:39:37,173
When you send the postal
card back, marriage is over.

789
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:39,176
You don't have to
give any reason?

790
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:41,178
No. It's all
on the postal card.

791
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:44,183
All you do is cross out
"having a wonderful time"?

792
00:39:44,184 --> 00:39:45,685
Yes.

793
00:39:45,686 --> 00:39:48,189
My first husband I met
at an athletic exhibition.

794
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:51,193
We shared the same
horizontal bar.

795
00:39:51,194 --> 00:39:53,696
But Bastakoff said
he was wrong for me.

796
00:39:53,697 --> 00:39:55,699
His somersaults
were no good?

797
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,902
They were fine, but
he was too animal.

798
00:39:57,903 --> 00:39:59,205
No ideals.

799
00:39:59,206 --> 00:40:01,241
So you put him
back on the bar.

800
00:40:01,242 --> 00:40:02,709
Yes.

801
00:40:12,692 --> 00:40:15,762
I suppose number two
was all right.

802
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:17,230
To the contrary.

803
00:40:17,231 --> 00:40:19,266
When he took
his shirt off,

804
00:40:19,267 --> 00:40:21,236
I realized I made
a dangerous mistake.

805
00:40:21,237 --> 00:40:22,737
Rickets?

806
00:40:22,738 --> 00:40:25,242
No. He had a portrait of the
czar tattooed on his chest.

807
00:40:25,243 --> 00:40:26,277
That's tough.

808
00:40:26,278 --> 00:40:27,745
Yes. I felt bad,

809
00:40:27,746 --> 00:40:29,748
but he's at the
lubyanka prison now,

810
00:40:29,749 --> 00:40:31,751
so everything
turn out all right.

811
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,791
We are being married
now, comrade.

812
00:40:38,295 --> 00:40:40,798
Excuse me, please.
What is your name?

813
00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:43,268
Oh, uh...
McKinley b. Thompson.

814
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:45,805
Uh, here.
It's on the passport.

815
00:40:45,806 --> 00:40:47,773
Oh! Amyerikanyets.

816
00:40:47,774 --> 00:40:49,776
Si, se√±or.

817
00:40:51,214 --> 00:40:52,715
Theodore.

818
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:54,217
Theodore?

819
00:40:58,724 --> 00:41:00,225
Hold it, hold it.

820
00:41:00,226 --> 00:41:01,727
What's the hitch?

821
00:41:01,728 --> 00:41:03,730
He says he can't
put down "Theodore"

822
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:05,767
for the name
of the bride.

823
00:41:05,768 --> 00:41:07,402
It is against
the law.

824
00:41:07,403 --> 00:41:08,738
That's too bad.

825
00:41:12,744 --> 00:41:14,746
Lizza Vineschka.
It's fixed.

826
00:41:14,747 --> 00:41:17,249
I took the name
of lizza Vineschka.

827
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,786
Hmm. Lizza Vineschka.

828
00:41:18,787 --> 00:41:21,255
She died under torture
by the mensheviks.

829
00:41:21,256 --> 00:41:22,791
Her feet
were burned off.

830
00:41:22,792 --> 00:41:24,727
May I be worthy
of her.

831
00:41:26,764 --> 00:41:29,300
You don't need
a stamp, huh?

832
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:31,270
No.
Everything is free.

833
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:34,241
Come. We have
lots of work to do.

834
00:41:38,882 --> 00:41:40,316
What time does
the plane leave?

835
00:41:40,317 --> 00:41:41,451
7 A.M.

836
00:41:41,452 --> 00:41:43,520
Bastakoff says you
can sleep on the plane.

837
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:46,325
I hope it don't turn out
I married Bastakoff.

838
00:41:46,326 --> 00:41:50,764
I'm a little tired, but
oh, so happy, Mr. Thompson.

839
00:41:53,269 --> 00:41:56,739
You know, we ought to
straighten out some things.

840
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,243
I'm Mac, see,
and you ain't Theodore.

841
00:41:59,244 --> 00:42:00,746
Lizza Vineschka?

842
00:42:00,747 --> 00:42:02,214
Well, Lizzie will do.

843
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:07,288
I take it you're spending
the night here, Lizzie,

844
00:42:07,289 --> 00:42:08,757
providing
I'm not tattooed.

845
00:42:08,758 --> 00:42:10,793
Oh, yes.
Under the Soviet,

846
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:12,796
marriage is the same
as anyplace else.

847
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:14,299
Only shorter.

848
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,768
It is like going into
partnership with somebody

849
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:18,270
and opening
a store.

850
00:42:18,271 --> 00:42:20,240
If business is bad,
store closes.

851
00:42:23,813 --> 00:42:25,882
What is this?

852
00:42:25,883 --> 00:42:27,751
What's what?

853
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:46,310
Ok, Lizzie.
You win.

854
00:42:46,311 --> 00:42:48,147
Get back
to your corner.

855
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,885
Stop! Please! Please!

856
00:42:50,886 --> 00:42:53,789
Olga milanova!

857
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:56,025
Theodore Yekhubitz!

858
00:42:56,026 --> 00:42:57,360
My hero!

859
00:42:58,797 --> 00:43:00,731
Hello. Give me
the barroom.

860
00:43:00,732 --> 00:43:03,269
Comrade, this is
Olga milanova.

861
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,805
Pleased to meet you.

862
00:43:04,806 --> 00:43:07,775
Barroom? Send me up
a bottle of kuemmel.

863
00:43:07,776 --> 00:43:09,777
Yeah. Room 310.
Thompson speaking.

864
00:43:09,778 --> 00:43:11,280
She's my sergeant.

865
00:43:11,281 --> 00:43:13,316
We're in the same women's
parachute division.

866
00:43:13,317 --> 00:43:15,285
She's got 8 medals
for jumping.

867
00:43:15,286 --> 00:43:17,789
She's going to get
another one in a minute.

868
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:18,958
Yeah, hello.

869
00:43:20,327 --> 00:43:21,829
Hello? Who is this?

870
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:24,799
No, no, no!
I don't want the Kremlin.

871
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,104
I want kuemmel-
a bottle of kuemmel.

872
00:43:32,312 --> 00:43:34,848
Excuse me, ladies.
I've had a hard day.

873
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:36,816
Would you mind
if I retired?

874
00:43:36,817 --> 00:43:38,853
Comrade milanova,
I would love you to stay,

875
00:43:38,854 --> 00:43:40,822
but we are only
married an hour,

876
00:43:40,823 --> 00:43:42,859
and we're not yet
acquainted.

877
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,863
Whoo! You're married! My
congratulations, comrade!

878
00:43:45,864 --> 00:43:48,399
You did not bring
your parachute.

879
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,370
Then how will you go
to the parade tomorrow?

880
00:43:51,371 --> 00:43:52,806
I'm not parading.

881
00:43:52,807 --> 00:43:54,809
We're leaving for america
on a secret mission.

882
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,311
Ooh! Propaganda.

883
00:43:56,312 --> 00:43:57,780
Sabotage.
Good night.

884
00:43:57,781 --> 00:43:59,817
Good night.
May Stalin conquer.

885
00:43:59,818 --> 00:44:01,418
Stalin
will not fail.

886
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:06,826
I didn't know you were looking
for a bride, Mr. Thompson.

887
00:44:06,827 --> 00:44:09,297
I wouldn't have fallen
asleep this afternoon.

888
00:44:09,298 --> 00:44:11,834
I, too, know how
to serve Russia.

889
00:44:11,835 --> 00:44:13,435
Good-bye, comrade.

890
00:44:24,854 --> 00:44:27,857
I wonder what I'd get
if I ordered scotch.

891
00:44:27,858 --> 00:44:30,827
Please order nothing. We
have everything we want:

892
00:44:30,828 --> 00:44:33,831
Youth, ideals, and
a cause to fight for.

893
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:39,874
Oh. So you did
bring your parachute.

894
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:42,010
I do not understand
what is wrong.

895
00:44:42,011 --> 00:44:43,378
That nightgown.

896
00:44:43,379 --> 00:44:45,348
You do not like
nightgowns?

897
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,851
Well, that one worries me
a little bit.

898
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,354
I must ask you
to explain.

899
00:44:49,355 --> 00:44:51,390
I thought we went
over all that.

900
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:53,327
I told you
a few hours ago

901
00:44:53,328 --> 00:44:55,295
what was wrong with
communist propaganda.

902
00:44:55,296 --> 00:44:57,332
I'm not making
propaganda now.

903
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:58,801
I'll say
you're not.

904
00:44:58,802 --> 00:45:00,336
I'm not thinking
of myself.

905
00:45:00,337 --> 00:45:02,340
Personally, nightgowns
mean nothing to me,

906
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:04,309
but you've got
work to do,

907
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:06,311
and it's important that
you start out right.

908
00:45:06,312 --> 00:45:07,847
Charm, beauty,
appeal-

909
00:45:07,848 --> 00:45:10,351
that's the way you're
going to spread communism

910
00:45:10,352 --> 00:45:11,852
in the new world.

911
00:45:11,853 --> 00:45:13,355
We both agreed
on it.

912
00:45:13,356 --> 00:45:14,824
Here. Put this on.

913
00:45:14,825 --> 00:45:16,827
I am going to spread
communism in this?

914
00:45:16,828 --> 00:45:18,830
Like a house afire.
Now go on.

915
00:45:18,831 --> 00:45:21,367
You got a job to do.
Do it right.

916
00:45:21,368 --> 00:45:23,336
I'm obeying you
blindly, comrade.

917
00:45:23,337 --> 00:45:26,307
Don't worry. I'm running
this propaganda unit.

918
00:45:30,347 --> 00:45:32,283
What a trousseau.

919
00:45:53,781 --> 00:45:56,584
It's a little on the
reactionary side.

920
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:03,260
I feel a little confused,
but I'm glad you like it.

921
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:04,594
Come here.

922
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:09,369
I want to
ask you something.

923
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,339
I found this
in your suitcase.

924
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,342
A wonderful face,
isn't it?

925
00:46:13,343 --> 00:46:14,876
Yeah. Who is it?

926
00:46:14,877 --> 00:46:16,379
Bastakoff.

927
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,847
You don't say?

928
00:46:17,848 --> 00:46:20,384
His eyes
are so sensitive...

929
00:46:20,385 --> 00:46:22,855
And his mouth-
like a Saint.

930
00:46:22,856 --> 00:46:25,859
Yeah. Saint Russia.

931
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:29,397
So gentle and yet
so full of ideals.

932
00:46:29,398 --> 00:46:32,902
To see him
is to love him.

933
00:46:32,903 --> 00:46:34,872
Uh, where does he live?

934
00:46:34,873 --> 00:46:36,375
Number 15
lemske prospect.

935
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,878
You think
he'd be there now?

936
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:42,383
It is a little late to go
calling, even on Bastakoff.

937
00:46:42,384 --> 00:46:45,420
No, no. Never too late
to call on a Saint.

938
00:46:45,421 --> 00:46:47,423
Maybe you could
write him a letter.

939
00:46:47,424 --> 00:46:50,428
He reads English, and
he loves to get letters.

940
00:46:50,429 --> 00:46:52,498
You must be tired-
all that walking.

941
00:46:52,499 --> 00:46:54,366
I'm used to walking.

942
00:46:54,367 --> 00:46:56,336
You just turn out
the lights and relax

943
00:46:56,337 --> 00:46:58,339
so you won't have a charley
horse in the morning.

944
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,374
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

945
00:47:00,375 --> 00:47:02,812
All I want is a few words
with Bastakoff.

946
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:09,255
Mac! I just heard you got a visa
and are leaving in the morning.

947
00:47:09,256 --> 00:47:11,290
Oh, sweetheart,
am I glad I found you.

948
00:47:11,291 --> 00:47:13,393
Look, darling, you still
love me a little-

949
00:47:13,394 --> 00:47:15,964
not much-just enough to
do me one farewell favor?

950
00:47:15,965 --> 00:47:17,634
I was just going out
for a breath of air.

951
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:19,035
Let's go down to the bar.

952
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:20,871
No! I can't
talk to you there.

953
00:47:20,872 --> 00:47:22,874
I've got my hands
on a terrific story.

954
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:24,409
Yeah? What is it?

955
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:26,412
Somebody tried to assassinate
Vasiliev this afternoon.

956
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:28,416
They shot him in the hand. Worst luck.

957
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:30,418
You'll be out of this
dogcatcher's country tomorrow-

958
00:47:30,419 --> 00:47:31,921
look, Jane,
I want you to meet-

959
00:47:31,922 --> 00:47:33,924
I want you to file the story
for me when you get out.

960
00:47:33,925 --> 00:47:36,393
Shut up, will ya? I'm trying
to introduce you to someone.

961
00:47:36,394 --> 00:47:38,396
You owe me that much
after Tokyo!

962
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,400
I want you to meet
my wife, you dope!

963
00:47:40,401 --> 00:47:42,035
What wife?

964
00:47:42,036 --> 00:47:44,371
Whoo! Where
are my glasses?

965
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:48,945
Oh, that. I thought
you'd be packing.

966
00:47:48,946 --> 00:47:50,414
I got married.

967
00:47:50,415 --> 00:47:53,384
Married? Oh, now, Mac,
that's going too far.

968
00:47:53,385 --> 00:47:57,123
Why should I say I was
married if I wasn't?

969
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,625
Does she speak English?

970
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,161
I speak 5 languages!

971
00:48:00,162 --> 00:48:01,395
Holy ike!

972
00:48:01,396 --> 00:48:02,865
Yes.
She's very smart.

973
00:48:02,866 --> 00:48:04,367
To marry
McKinley b. Thompson?

974
00:48:04,368 --> 00:48:06,069
That's not smart,
that's wizardry.

975
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:07,439
Congratulations, my dear.

976
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,076
I didn't think it could be done
without a police warrant.

977
00:48:10,077 --> 00:48:11,410
You are
sweetheart?

978
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:12,913
Relax, honey.
I'm one of the alumnae.

979
00:48:12,914 --> 00:48:14,248
I do not understand.

980
00:48:14,249 --> 00:48:16,885
Me neither. I never understood
it. It just happened.

981
00:48:16,886 --> 00:48:18,387
A geisha girl
with bowlegs,

982
00:48:18,388 --> 00:48:20,257
and I got the job
of Madame Butterfly,

983
00:48:20,258 --> 00:48:22,093
nose against the window.

984
00:48:22,094 --> 00:48:25,297
What she's trying to tell you is that
we're great old friends, that's all.

985
00:48:25,298 --> 00:48:29,168
I do not expect a man of your
age to be entirely innocent.

986
00:48:29,169 --> 00:48:30,738
Have you known
each other long?

987
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:32,407
No, but we have
the same ideals.

988
00:48:32,408 --> 00:48:34,443
I'm glad of that.
Then I can speak freely.

989
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:36,446
Come on. That's enough.
We'll take a walk.

990
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:38,449
On your wedding night?
Don't be silly.

991
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:39,918
You can trust me.

992
00:48:39,919 --> 00:48:42,087
I won't let on to the
bride what a rat you are.

993
00:48:42,088 --> 00:48:44,190
That she must
find out for herself.

994
00:48:44,191 --> 00:48:46,962
I'm sure you won't mind your husband
doing something for me, will you?

995
00:48:46,963 --> 00:48:51,034
Particularly something that will help
knock the props out of this phony Soviet.

996
00:48:51,035 --> 00:48:52,036
Wait a minute!

997
00:48:52,037 --> 00:48:53,504
This what?

998
00:48:53,505 --> 00:48:55,907
Don't get nervous, honey.
We're all safe inside this room.

999
00:48:55,908 --> 00:48:57,877
We can take our ideals out
and play with them.

1000
00:48:57,878 --> 00:48:59,846
Will you cut it out?
Let's go downstairs.

1001
00:48:59,847 --> 00:49:01,449
I'll only stay a minute.

1002
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:03,752
The reason I want Mac
to do this for me

1003
00:49:03,753 --> 00:49:05,755
is not only because
we're old friends,

1004
00:49:05,756 --> 00:49:08,259
but he and I also have
the same ideals.

1005
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,961
We both hate Russia
in spades.

1006
00:49:09,962 --> 00:49:11,330
That's a lie.
I love Russia.

1007
00:49:11,331 --> 00:49:12,497
What?

1008
00:49:12,498 --> 00:49:13,901
It's purely jealousy.
Pay no attention to her.

1009
00:49:13,902 --> 00:49:15,536
Who's jealous of what,
you fathead?

1010
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:17,939
You've been hounding me ever
since I broke your heart. Get out.

1011
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,942
Broke my heart?
What is this?

1012
00:49:19,943 --> 00:49:22,913
That's why you're trying to tell
her that I'm not a communist.

1013
00:49:22,914 --> 00:49:25,416
You're supposed to
be a communist?

1014
00:49:25,417 --> 00:49:26,785
Oh ho ho ho!

1015
00:49:26,786 --> 00:49:28,455
Ok, ok.
Now beat it.

1016
00:49:28,456 --> 00:49:30,424
Just a minute!
What is your name?

1017
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,960
Honey, my name's Jane Wilson,
and I'm queen of the may.

1018
00:49:32,961 --> 00:49:35,631
Mine is Theodore Yekhubitz, and
I want to investigate something!

1019
00:49:35,632 --> 00:49:37,600
Get back in bed.
You'll catch cold.

1020
00:49:37,601 --> 00:49:38,969
You keep quiet!

1021
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:40,939
You're surprised to hear
he's a communist?

1022
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,976
He's not the noble soul?
He's not burning with ideals?

1023
00:49:43,977 --> 00:49:45,946
Oh, ho! That is
the lowest, dirtiest trick

1024
00:49:45,947 --> 00:49:49,217
I ever heard of anyone
playing, even on a wife.

1025
00:49:49,218 --> 00:49:51,720
Mac, your technique
must be slipping.

1026
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:53,991
I never knew you to
stoop to politics before.

1027
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:57,963
Never mind about my story.
I'll get it in myself.

1028
00:49:57,964 --> 00:49:59,499
Where are you
going?

1029
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,001
I'm going to see
Bastakoff.

1030
00:50:01,002 --> 00:50:03,003
Oh, no. You're
trying to escape.

1031
00:50:03,004 --> 00:50:05,006
I knew there was something
when you put on your tie.

1032
00:50:05,007 --> 00:50:06,509
Give me that key.

1033
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:08,478
No. You're going to have a talk
with me, right here, right now!

1034
00:50:08,479 --> 00:50:10,481
I don't talk to ladies who start
yelling. It's a rule I've got.

1035
00:50:10,482 --> 00:50:12,518
Be a good girl
and give me that key.

1036
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:14,486
I want the truth.
You're not a communist?

1037
00:50:14,487 --> 00:50:16,022
Who said I was?

1038
00:50:16,023 --> 00:50:17,490
You traitor!
I see through you.

1039
00:50:17,491 --> 00:50:19,494
You are trying to steal
me away from Russia!

1040
00:50:19,495 --> 00:50:21,030
Is a capitalistic
plot!

1041
00:50:21,031 --> 00:50:23,032
Put that chair down
before I get sore.

1042
00:50:23,033 --> 00:50:25,035
Nobody's trying
to do anything.

1043
00:50:25,036 --> 00:50:27,005
You got a postcard.
Mail it in.

1044
00:50:27,006 --> 00:50:30,042
You think you can make me
betray Russia? I spit on you!

1045
00:50:30,043 --> 00:50:31,678
Get back in bed
and behave yourself.

1046
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:34,048
My last husband is in the
lubyanka prison rotting away.

1047
00:50:34,049 --> 00:50:36,285
That's where you're going,
to rot away beside him.

1048
00:50:36,286 --> 00:50:39,556
Listen, blintze brain, put that
chair down, or I'll crown you.

1049
00:50:39,557 --> 00:50:41,726
You're right.
I've lost my head.

1050
00:50:41,727 --> 00:50:43,528
I'm behaving
like a child.

1051
00:50:48,537 --> 00:50:51,140
Fine wedding night
this turned out to be!

1052
00:50:52,676 --> 00:50:53,877
Who are you
calling up, stupid?

1053
00:50:53,878 --> 00:50:55,846
I'm calling
the secret police.

1054
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:57,482
Oh, you are, are you?

1055
00:50:57,483 --> 00:51:00,019
Yes. You're a spy. They
will find out soon enough.

1056
00:51:03,525 --> 00:51:04,525
Ah!

1057
00:51:06,028 --> 00:51:08,464
Oh, get her. She wants
to wrestle, huh?

1058
00:51:19,548 --> 00:51:20,982
Shut up! Ow!

1059
00:51:26,925 --> 00:51:30,496
Shut up!

1060
00:51:39,277 --> 00:51:40,544
You Mr. Thompson?

1061
00:51:40,545 --> 00:51:41,579
Yeah.

1062
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,047
Commissar Vasiliev
wishes to see you.

1063
00:51:43,048 --> 00:51:45,050
You are to come with me
at once to the Kremlin.

1064
00:51:45,051 --> 00:51:46,218
What's going on?

1065
00:51:46,219 --> 00:51:47,420
No questions, please.

1066
00:51:47,421 --> 00:51:48,421
You brute!

1067
00:51:48,422 --> 00:51:49,523
Who is this lady?

1068
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:50,724
I'm his wife.

1069
00:51:50,725 --> 00:51:52,495
Then you must
come with him.

1070
00:51:52,496 --> 00:51:53,996
To the secret
police? Good!

1071
00:51:53,997 --> 00:51:55,532
That's where
I want to go.

1072
00:51:55,533 --> 00:51:57,034
Excuse me, please.
I will get dressed.

1073
00:51:57,035 --> 00:51:58,503
You have not time.

1074
00:51:58,504 --> 00:52:00,305
I am a member of the party.
I cannot go like this.

1075
00:52:00,306 --> 00:52:03,209
You will come as you are. We cannot waste
time allowing you to disguise yourself.

1076
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:05,513
I'm a friend of Vasiliev's.
You mind telling me what's up?

1077
00:52:05,514 --> 00:52:07,516
You will find out
soon enough, Mr. Thompson.

1078
00:52:12,224 --> 00:52:13,490
Oh, excuse.

1079
00:52:19,067 --> 00:52:20,902
Comrade, I wish
to make a statement!

1080
00:52:20,903 --> 00:52:22,403
I'm a member
of the party.

1081
00:52:22,404 --> 00:52:24,073
Workers' council 72,
division "b,"

1082
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:25,742
Theodore Yekhubitz,
streetcar motorman.

1083
00:52:26,711 --> 00:52:28,713
Mr. Thompson,
you are to go inside.

1084
00:52:28,714 --> 00:52:30,548
Don't be rough
on her, pal.

1085
00:52:30,549 --> 00:52:33,553
This is her bridal night.
She's a little confused.

1086
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:24,060
Hey, commissar.

1087
00:53:24,061 --> 00:53:26,562
Come on out.
It's only me.

1088
00:53:29,601 --> 00:53:32,705
¬∂ When I came home
last night at 3 ¬∂

1089
00:53:32,706 --> 00:53:36,076
¬∂ the man was waiting
there for me ¬∂

1090
00:53:36,077 --> 00:53:38,080
well! A radio!

1091
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:41,117
Thanks for the entertainment,
commissar.

1092
00:53:47,126 --> 00:53:50,130
Oh, hello, Hofer.
Come on in. Join the party.

1093
00:53:50,131 --> 00:53:51,599
Where's
the commissar?

1094
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,067
Right there.
He's invisible.

1095
00:53:53,068 --> 00:53:54,737
There's a new
Russian invention.

1096
00:53:54,738 --> 00:53:57,072
You rub it on your hair,
and you disappear.

1097
00:53:57,073 --> 00:53:59,576
Ought to come in handy
if you're a detective.

1098
00:53:59,577 --> 00:54:01,579
Your jokes, Mr. Thompson,
fail to amuse me.

1099
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,116
Commissar Vasiliev!

1100
00:54:03,117 --> 00:54:05,552
You're
a fine pal, commissar,

1101
00:54:05,553 --> 00:54:07,554
getting a guy out
this time of night.

1102
00:54:07,555 --> 00:54:09,591
May I sympathize
with you, commissar,

1103
00:54:09,592 --> 00:54:11,560
on your deplorable
accident this afternoon.

1104
00:54:11,561 --> 00:54:13,095
Please sit down,
gentlemen.

1105
00:54:13,096 --> 00:54:15,399
An exit visa has been
signed for you, Mr. Thompson.

1106
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,236
When did you
intend to leave?

1107
00:54:17,237 --> 00:54:18,604
On the 7:00 plane.

1108
00:54:18,605 --> 00:54:20,073
Why are you leaving?

1109
00:54:20,074 --> 00:54:22,576
I hate to say, commissar.
You'll just get sore.

1110
00:54:22,577 --> 00:54:24,111
I've asked the question.

1111
00:54:24,112 --> 00:54:25,614
Ok. Now,
no hard feelings,

1112
00:54:25,615 --> 00:54:28,618
but I'm kind of lonely to
get back to good old u.S.A.

1113
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:30,087
You know how it is.

1114
00:54:30,088 --> 00:54:32,090
If you were stuck away in
New York with nothing to do

1115
00:54:32,091 --> 00:54:34,126
but to see the
Yankees play ball

1116
00:54:34,127 --> 00:54:36,129
or stay up all night
dancing in some hot spot,

1117
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:37,597
you'd get lonely
for all this

1118
00:54:37,598 --> 00:54:40,802
and want to get back to the
Kremlin and the secret police.

1119
00:54:40,803 --> 00:54:42,672
Well, that's
the way I feel.

1120
00:54:42,673 --> 00:54:44,975
Does that belong
to you, herr Von Hofer?

1121
00:54:44,976 --> 00:54:46,143
No.

1122
00:54:46,144 --> 00:54:47,612
You are
interested in it?

1123
00:54:47,613 --> 00:54:50,149
I beg you to forgive me,
herr commissar.

1124
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,285
My mind was
on something else.

1125
00:54:52,286 --> 00:54:54,088
Have you ever
seen that before?

1126
00:54:54,089 --> 00:54:57,093
All radios look alike
to me. It's German-made.

1127
00:54:57,094 --> 00:54:59,496
How about it, Hofer?
Somebody steal this from you?

1128
00:54:59,497 --> 00:55:02,767
I have never seen that radio
before. I give you my word.

1129
00:55:02,768 --> 00:55:04,903
This is not a radio,
herr Von Hofer.

1130
00:55:04,904 --> 00:55:06,405
This is
a secret camera.

1131
00:55:06,406 --> 00:55:08,174
No!

1132
00:55:08,175 --> 00:55:09,778
You don't say?
Well, well!

1133
00:55:09,779 --> 00:55:13,082
I take it this is some
kind of evidence, huh?

1134
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:14,450
Yes.

1135
00:55:14,451 --> 00:55:16,587
Whose is it? If you're not
giving away state secrets.

1136
00:55:16,588 --> 00:55:17,989
It is the property
of Comrade X.

1137
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:19,624
Then you've
caught him?

1138
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:21,227
Yes, we've caught him.

1139
00:55:21,228 --> 00:55:24,265
Well, congratulations, commissar.
That's quite a feather in your cap.

1140
00:55:24,266 --> 00:55:25,633
You are pleased?

1141
00:55:25,634 --> 00:55:28,103
I always like to see
a pal make good, sure.

1142
00:55:28,104 --> 00:55:30,773
Are you giving us a statement
on the subject tonight?

1143
00:55:30,774 --> 00:55:31,909
Yes.

1144
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,823
There is comrade
x for you, gentlemen.

1145
00:55:44,728 --> 00:55:46,730
Which one
is Comrade X?

1146
00:55:46,731 --> 00:55:48,834
You know this man,
herr Von Hofer?

1147
00:55:48,835 --> 00:55:51,804
Yes. He's an employee
of the hotel ambassador.

1148
00:55:51,805 --> 00:55:53,806
I know him as a valet.

1149
00:55:53,807 --> 00:55:55,142
And you?

1150
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,812
Listen, commissar, I don't
want to spoil your party,

1151
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:01,184
but if that's Comrade X, I'll
eat the Kremlin without sauce.

1152
00:56:01,185 --> 00:56:04,189
Take it easy, Vanya. I'll
straighten this out for you.

1153
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:07,193
This fellow is the dumbest,
dopiest valet in all Moscow.

1154
00:56:07,194 --> 00:56:09,863
I've known him for months.
He's a potato-head.

1155
00:56:09,864 --> 00:56:11,365
You can't be serious,
commissar.

1156
00:56:11,366 --> 00:56:14,336
This secret camera was found
in his room, inside his pillow.

1157
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:18,342
Do you wish to make a statement to
the press, Ivan fedorovich Yekhubitz?

1158
00:56:18,343 --> 00:56:19,844
Yes. Why not?

1159
00:56:19,845 --> 00:56:20,979
Proceed.

1160
00:56:22,382 --> 00:56:24,083
I'm Comrade X.

1161
00:56:24,084 --> 00:56:25,552
Continue, please.

1162
00:56:25,553 --> 00:56:28,891
What else? Uh...I'm
a traitor to Russia,

1163
00:56:28,892 --> 00:56:30,860
and I've worked
very hard

1164
00:56:30,861 --> 00:56:33,864
to undermine the Soviet, and, um...

1165
00:56:33,865 --> 00:56:36,768
I'm Comrade X.
What more can I say?

1166
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:38,003
He's drunk.

1167
00:56:38,004 --> 00:56:40,406
I'm glad for our sakes
it wasn't one of us.

1168
00:56:40,407 --> 00:56:42,544
I'm not so certain yet,
herr Von Hofer.

1169
00:56:42,545 --> 00:56:46,315
Yekhubitz was undoubtedly hiding
the camera for someone else,

1170
00:56:46,316 --> 00:56:50,355
and your joint secretary reports
that she saw it this morning

1171
00:56:50,356 --> 00:56:53,892
in the suite shared
by you and Mr. Thompson.

1172
00:56:53,893 --> 00:56:55,863
Who was your accomplice,
Comrade X?

1173
00:56:55,864 --> 00:56:57,331
Who was what?

1174
00:56:57,332 --> 00:56:58,867
Who helped you?

1175
00:56:58,868 --> 00:57:01,371
Who helped me? What do I need help for?

1176
00:57:01,372 --> 00:57:03,374
You're lying. We know
you were in league

1177
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:05,342
with one of the foreign
correspondents.

1178
00:57:05,343 --> 00:57:06,878
Never, as god
as my judge.

1179
00:57:06,879 --> 00:57:08,381
There is no god.

1180
00:57:08,382 --> 00:57:11,385
Then whoever is in his place,
let him judge, commissar.

1181
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:14,523
It's the same thing
to me, whoever judges.

1182
00:57:14,524 --> 00:57:15,858
Commissar.

1183
00:57:20,399 --> 00:57:24,037
It seems your daughter is
outside and wishes to speak to me.

1184
00:57:24,038 --> 00:57:26,640
What? That is
impossible.

1185
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:28,376
I have no daughter.

1186
00:57:28,377 --> 00:57:30,412
Do you wish
to make a statement?

1187
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:32,915
Comrade commissar, I am
a member of the party.

1188
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:34,886
I have sent one
husband to prison

1189
00:57:34,887 --> 00:57:36,220
because he was
a traitor.

1190
00:57:36,221 --> 00:57:37,589
My record is clean.

1191
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:38,924
You know this man?

1192
00:57:38,925 --> 00:57:41,394
I know him since I was
born. He's my father.

1193
00:57:41,395 --> 00:57:44,332
I can bring you witnesses
that I never saw her before.

1194
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:45,834
Quiet. Proceed.

1195
00:57:45,835 --> 00:57:48,372
My father is not Comrade X, commissar.

1196
00:57:48,373 --> 00:57:49,640
I can prove it.

1197
00:57:49,641 --> 00:57:51,843
You can prove it?
I can prove it, too!

1198
00:57:51,844 --> 00:57:53,346
That handkerchief
proves it.

1199
00:57:53,347 --> 00:57:55,381
I told you I'd straighten
this out for you.

1200
00:57:55,382 --> 00:57:57,851
Why don't you leave it to
me and keep your trap shut?

1201
00:57:57,852 --> 00:58:00,889
You keep shut! What does it
matter what happens to me?

1202
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:03,026
I'm an old man.
Look here, commissar-

1203
00:58:03,027 --> 00:58:05,029
don't
be an idiot, Vanya.

1204
00:58:05,030 --> 00:58:07,866
You seem very anxious to
protect your valet, Mr. Thompson.

1205
00:58:07,867 --> 00:58:11,404
I'm anxious to see anyone
get a fair trial, commissar.

1206
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:13,407
Very commendable.
Proceed.

1207
00:58:13,408 --> 00:58:16,379
What were you saying
about this handkerchief?

1208
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:18,882
Ha! That's how I fooled
the whole police.

1209
00:58:18,883 --> 00:58:20,384
Look here, commissar.

1210
00:58:20,385 --> 00:58:24,423
You just put this
handkerchief over something,

1211
00:58:24,424 --> 00:58:26,425
and you will see.

1212
00:58:26,426 --> 00:58:30,365
Look. You see how
it shows through?

1213
00:58:30,366 --> 00:58:32,368
Somebody else
outside Russia

1214
00:58:32,369 --> 00:58:35,406
has a handkerchief
just like this one.

1215
00:58:35,407 --> 00:58:37,708
They put it over
my writing,

1216
00:58:37,709 --> 00:58:40,781
and they only read what
I want them to read.

1217
00:58:40,782 --> 00:58:43,351
That's an old trick
for sending code messages.

1218
00:58:43,352 --> 00:58:44,352
Yes.

1219
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:45,887
Yes, I know.
Simple, but clever.

1220
00:58:45,888 --> 00:58:47,689
Have a look,
Mr. Thompson.

1221
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,894
You'll see that certain words
appear through the linen.

1222
00:58:50,895 --> 00:58:51,996
Hmm.

1223
00:58:53,566 --> 00:58:55,535
Well,
what do you know?

1224
00:58:55,536 --> 00:58:57,371
That's very
interesting.

1225
00:58:57,372 --> 00:59:00,909
Looks as though your troubles
are almost over, commissar.

1226
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:02,477
Almost.

1227
00:59:02,478 --> 00:59:04,380
Your father
is a stupid man.

1228
00:59:04,381 --> 00:59:07,351
I haven't believed for a minute
that he alone is Comrade X.

1229
00:59:07,352 --> 00:59:09,922
I expected him to tell
me who his employer is.

1230
00:59:09,923 --> 00:59:11,424
Now he has told.

1231
00:59:11,425 --> 00:59:13,460
I have
told nothing!

1232
00:59:13,461 --> 00:59:15,930
Send to the press bureau for
all copy mail out of Russia

1233
00:59:15,931 --> 00:59:17,933
for every foreign correspondent
in the last 8 months.

1234
00:59:17,934 --> 00:59:19,267
At once,
commissar.

1235
00:59:19,268 --> 00:59:20,904
Have them brought
to my office,

1236
00:59:20,905 --> 00:59:23,942
and no correspondent is allowed to
leave his room or use the telephone.

1237
00:59:23,943 --> 00:59:25,444
Herr Von Hofer?

1238
00:59:25,445 --> 00:59:27,413
You may return
to your room.

1239
00:59:27,414 --> 00:59:29,616
Your copy will be read
through this handkerchief.

1240
00:59:29,617 --> 00:59:31,419
I'll notify you
of any results.

1241
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:34,791
Yes, commissar. I can only
wish you a quick success.

1242
00:59:34,792 --> 00:59:36,327
And you,
Mr. Thompson,

1243
00:59:36,328 --> 00:59:38,462
I'm afraid, will have
to postpone for a while

1244
00:59:38,463 --> 00:59:39,965
your departure
from Russia.

1245
00:59:39,966 --> 00:59:41,934
Say, you couldn't
drive me away now.

1246
00:59:41,935 --> 00:59:44,972
I'll be on pins and needles
until you find the heel

1247
00:59:44,973 --> 00:59:47,476
that's letting this poor
goof take the rap for him.

1248
00:59:47,477 --> 00:59:49,445
Promise you'll let me
know the minute it breaks.

1249
00:59:49,446 --> 00:59:51,481
I'll be sitting
right by the phone.

1250
00:59:51,482 --> 00:59:53,484
You shall be
the first to hear.

1251
00:59:53,485 --> 00:59:54,986
Thanks.
Thanks, commissar.

1252
00:59:54,987 --> 00:59:56,455
Come on, Theodore.

1253
00:59:56,456 --> 00:59:57,956
I hate you.

1254
00:59:57,957 --> 01:00:01,463
Shame on you to say
you hate your own husband.

1255
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:02,998
Just a moment.

1256
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:04,400
Did you say husband?

1257
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:07,337
Yes.

1258
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:09,507
Quit joking. The
commissar has work to do.

1259
01:00:09,508 --> 01:00:11,509
Don't touch me!
You lied to me.

1260
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:13,513
He told me he was
a communist,

1261
01:00:13,514 --> 01:00:15,182
interested
in world revolution.

1262
01:00:15,183 --> 01:00:16,584
He swore it!

1263
01:00:16,585 --> 01:00:19,021
You know how it is when you're
crazy in love with a girl

1264
01:00:19,022 --> 01:00:20,489
and she's a little
cracked on some subject.

1265
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:21,491
Come on, honey.

1266
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:22,559
One moment,
Mr. Thompson.

1267
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,528
You try to leave
Russia suddenly,

1268
01:00:24,529 --> 01:00:26,532
and on the Eve
of your departure,

1269
01:00:26,533 --> 01:00:28,868
you marry the daughter
of a man who stupidly tries

1270
01:00:28,869 --> 01:00:30,704
to take the blame
for being Comrade X.

1271
01:00:30,705 --> 01:00:32,540
That's quite an interesting
story, commissar.

1272
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:34,008
Why don't you send
these people home,

1273
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:35,878
and we'll have a long
talk about it?

1274
01:00:35,879 --> 01:00:39,016
You are going to be held in
the Kremlin, Mr. Thompson-

1275
01:00:39,017 --> 01:00:42,521
you, this man, and this woman
- but not for long.

1276
01:00:42,522 --> 01:00:45,458
I promise you, yours
will be the first copy

1277
01:00:45,459 --> 01:00:47,461
which I will read
through this handkerchief.

1278
01:00:47,462 --> 01:00:48,964
Take the prisoners.

1279
01:00:50,499 --> 01:00:51,901
What is this?

1280
01:00:51,902 --> 01:00:53,470
Why am I treated
like this?

1281
01:00:53,471 --> 01:00:55,406
I came here as
your friend to confess!

1282
01:00:55,407 --> 01:00:57,509
Here's a message to
the American embassy.

1283
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:59,345
I demand you
have it delivered.

1284
01:00:59,346 --> 01:01:00,647
Take the prisoners.

1285
01:01:00,648 --> 01:01:02,148
Please,
come with us.

1286
01:01:10,061 --> 01:01:11,997
Why did you do
this to me, Mac?

1287
01:01:11,998 --> 01:01:14,500
Why does a man lie to a woman?

1288
01:01:14,501 --> 01:01:16,035
Because
he loves her.

1289
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:21,878
He says,
please, not to talk.

1290
01:01:29,055 --> 01:01:30,556
Come on, Vanya.

1291
01:01:30,557 --> 01:01:33,061
You're a big boy now.
You mustn't cry.

1292
01:01:33,062 --> 01:01:35,030
I'm crying for you
and for golubka.

1293
01:01:35,031 --> 01:01:37,566
Look what I have
done to you.

1294
01:01:37,567 --> 01:01:39,069
What does it matter?

1295
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,071
I know
what you feel.

1296
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,976
You are young,
and you are in love.

1297
01:01:43,977 --> 01:01:46,012
What is love?
An accident.

1298
01:01:46,013 --> 01:01:50,986
Gorki says love is the failure
of the mind to understand nature.

1299
01:01:50,987 --> 01:01:52,522
Gorki, schmorki.

1300
01:01:52,523 --> 01:01:57,027
I say you should be lying
in a field of daisies,

1301
01:01:57,028 --> 01:02:00,032
and look where
I have brought you.

1302
01:02:00,033 --> 01:02:02,035
What does it matter?

1303
01:02:02,036 --> 01:02:04,505
Many have died
for Russia.

1304
01:02:04,506 --> 01:02:07,042
We are 3 more.

1305
01:02:07,043 --> 01:02:09,112
I forgive you, father.

1306
01:02:09,113 --> 01:02:13,452
And you, too, comrade.
I forgive you.

1307
01:02:16,557 --> 01:02:18,559
You're not
sore at me?

1308
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,062
You're going to pay
for your crime.

1309
01:02:21,063 --> 01:02:24,534
In a little while, you will
be lying silent...Forever.

1310
01:02:24,535 --> 01:02:27,538
Hey, listen, honey.
I take a lot of killing.

1311
01:02:27,539 --> 01:02:29,575
Come on.
Forgive me again.

1312
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:40,457
Maximilian!

1313
01:02:40,458 --> 01:02:41,658
Theodore!

1314
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,035
Who are those
jitterbugs?

1315
01:02:49,036 --> 01:02:50,973
Her friends.

1316
01:02:56,648 --> 01:02:59,518
What, um...
What are they singing?

1317
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:03,055
Same thing they always sing in prison:

1318
01:03:03,056 --> 01:03:05,026
"We are free."

1319
01:03:15,507 --> 01:03:18,044
I'm happy now.
They're all here.

1320
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:21,683
Yeah. Yes, it does
make it kind of homey.

1321
01:03:34,569 --> 01:03:37,605
Is, uh...Bastakoff a member
of your literary group?

1322
01:03:37,606 --> 01:03:39,608
Please don't
speak his name.

1323
01:03:39,609 --> 01:03:41,077
Why not?

1324
01:03:41,078 --> 01:03:44,049
We will die without
betraying him.

1325
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:47,019
Kind of smart of him
to stay away.

1326
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:16,594
We are in the cell
for the dead.

1327
01:04:16,595 --> 01:04:19,098
Our time
will come soon.

1328
01:04:19,099 --> 01:04:22,068
Bastakoff will be
proud of us.

1329
01:04:23,573 --> 01:04:27,610
Hey, listen, baby. You're two
jumps ahead of a butterfly net,

1330
01:04:27,611 --> 01:04:29,613
like nearly all
the russians I know.

1331
01:04:29,614 --> 01:04:31,116
They've all blindfolded
themselves,

1332
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:34,120
and they're hanging from the
chandeliers by their toes,

1333
01:04:34,121 --> 01:04:35,621
throwing rocks
at each other,

1334
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:38,626
and for a finish, they'll
set fire to their pants.

1335
01:04:38,627 --> 01:04:41,630
They're all a lot of political
palookas playing at Halloween,

1336
01:04:41,631 --> 01:04:44,034
and when you ask them
what they're doing,

1337
01:04:44,035 --> 01:04:46,037
they'll holler back,
"ideals."

1338
01:04:46,038 --> 01:04:49,074
Well, I got a few ideals
of my own, baby,

1339
01:04:49,075 --> 01:04:52,079
and right now, they tell
me that you weren't meant

1340
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,549
to be a motorman
or a pumpkin-head.

1341
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:56,118
You're a beautiful woman,

1342
01:04:56,119 --> 01:05:00,557
and nobody's going to turn a
machine gun on you if I can help it.

1343
01:05:00,558 --> 01:05:02,060
That's my politic.

1344
01:05:36,110 --> 01:05:37,811
What did
the officer say?

1345
01:05:37,812 --> 01:05:39,613
The same thing
as before-

1346
01:05:39,614 --> 01:05:43,587
he's going to tell somebody upstairs
- but he's lying.

1347
01:05:43,588 --> 01:05:46,057
He's been lying
all night.

1348
01:05:46,058 --> 01:05:47,558
We are next.

1349
01:05:48,928 --> 01:05:52,565
Oh, I'd like to get
some sleep before I die.

1350
01:05:58,108 --> 01:06:01,078
I understand you have a
confession to make. Proceed.

1351
01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:03,081
I want to talk
to Vasiliev.

1352
01:06:03,082 --> 01:06:05,117
Why do you wish
to talk to Vasiliev?

1353
01:06:05,118 --> 01:06:07,586
Here's my proposition. You take
me up to him, and I'll give him

1354
01:06:07,587 --> 01:06:10,124
the name of the man who tried
to assassinate him yesterday,

1355
01:06:10,125 --> 01:06:11,627
the leader of
this counterrevolution,

1356
01:06:11,628 --> 01:06:14,597
and I'll give him a picture of
the fellow doing the shooting.

1357
01:06:14,598 --> 01:06:16,099
You have this?

1358
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:18,102
Vasiliev has been executing
a lot of harmless people here

1359
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:20,138
who don't know
what it's all about.

1360
01:06:20,139 --> 01:06:22,142
He doesn't know that
they're just being used

1361
01:06:22,143 --> 01:06:24,144
by this underhanded,
double-crossing killer.

1362
01:06:24,145 --> 01:06:26,114
He's bad, dangerous.
He means business.

1363
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:28,651
You photographed him while
he was shooting Vasiliev?

1364
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:32,122
That's right, and I'm ready to
make a deal with the commissar.

1365
01:06:46,243 --> 01:06:48,580
I have repeated to the
commissar your information.

1366
01:06:48,581 --> 01:06:49,882
He will see you now.

1367
01:06:49,883 --> 01:06:50,950
Thanks.

1368
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,636
How do you do,
Mr. Thompson?

1369
01:07:04,637 --> 01:07:06,806
Hello.

1370
01:07:06,807 --> 01:07:08,774
I'm Michael Bastakoff.

1371
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:11,612
So I see.

1372
01:07:11,613 --> 01:07:13,882
You are surprised
to see me.

1373
01:07:13,883 --> 01:07:15,619
Yes, Mr. Bastakoff,

1374
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:17,655
and I don't
surprise easy.

1375
01:07:17,656 --> 01:07:19,657
Sit down.

1376
01:07:19,658 --> 01:07:21,660
Thanks.

1377
01:07:21,661 --> 01:07:25,298
I take it comrade
Vasiliev is not around.

1378
01:07:25,299 --> 01:07:30,072
My predecessor was a victim
last night of a traffic accident.

1379
01:07:32,677 --> 01:07:34,679
Is he expected
to recover?

1380
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:37,683
No. He caught pneumonia.

1381
01:07:37,684 --> 01:07:40,554
I understand you know me,
Mr. Thompson.

1382
01:07:40,555 --> 01:07:43,025
I had the pleasure
of seeing you

1383
01:07:43,026 --> 01:07:44,726
in your coffin,
Mr. Bastakoff.

1384
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:49,133
You are more naive than
I expected, Mr. Thompson,

1385
01:07:49,134 --> 01:07:52,637
but one can never hope
to meet a realist

1386
01:07:52,638 --> 01:07:55,609
and an American
at the same time.

1387
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:59,114
First, allow me to assure
you I greatly admire

1388
01:07:59,115 --> 01:08:02,986
the genius you have
revealed as Comrade X.

1389
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:06,257
You finally tracked
me down, huh?

1390
01:08:06,258 --> 01:08:08,661
We are wasting time,
Mr. Thompson.

1391
01:08:08,662 --> 01:08:11,131
You have
a photograph of me.

1392
01:08:11,132 --> 01:08:13,635
Yes-
running for office.

1393
01:08:13,636 --> 01:08:15,303
May I see it?

1394
01:08:15,304 --> 01:08:16,639
Sure.

1395
01:08:19,677 --> 01:08:24,050
How quickly fortune changes
when we help it a little.

1396
01:08:25,987 --> 01:08:29,758
Ha ha! It is not
very flattering, huh?

1397
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:31,159
Ha ha!

1398
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,663
You have other
prints of this?

1399
01:08:33,664 --> 01:08:35,734
No.
Only the negative.

1400
01:08:35,735 --> 01:08:38,104
And that is hidden.

1401
01:08:38,105 --> 01:08:39,772
Right.

1402
01:08:39,773 --> 01:08:43,678
I see I am dealing with a
resourceful man, Mr. Thompson.

1403
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:48,652
May I ask you also to be a
realist for a few minutes?

1404
01:08:48,653 --> 01:08:50,655
I will be frank
with you.

1405
01:08:50,656 --> 01:08:53,625
This photograph is
exceedingly embarrassing to me.

1406
01:08:53,626 --> 01:08:59,733
It reveals a phase of my life
that I have, uh...Outgrown.

1407
01:08:59,734 --> 01:09:03,173
I imagine the fact
that 100 russians

1408
01:09:03,174 --> 01:09:05,142
were executed
last night

1409
01:09:05,143 --> 01:09:07,145
for being followers
of Bastakoff

1410
01:09:07,146 --> 01:09:09,114
is also a little
embarrassing.

1411
01:09:09,115 --> 01:09:11,651
It is, Mr. Thompson,
I admit.

1412
01:09:11,652 --> 01:09:13,988
Especially since
it was Bastakoff

1413
01:09:13,989 --> 01:09:15,857
who ordered
their execution.

1414
01:09:15,858 --> 01:09:18,695
I will continue to be
frank, Mr. Thompson,

1415
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:22,166
because I want you to be
equally frank with me.

1416
01:09:22,167 --> 01:09:24,703
In assuming the post
of police chief,

1417
01:09:24,704 --> 01:09:28,710
my first duty was to convince
the government of my sincerity.

1418
01:09:28,711 --> 01:09:31,714
What more convincing
gesture could I make

1419
01:09:31,715 --> 01:09:34,718
than the liquidation
of my own disciples?

1420
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:37,488
The party itself
has congratulated me.

1421
01:09:37,489 --> 01:09:39,558
I don't get it.
For what?

1422
01:09:39,559 --> 01:09:41,027
For many things-

1423
01:09:41,028 --> 01:09:43,063
for loving Russia
as a whole,

1424
01:09:43,064 --> 01:09:46,067
for ridding myself of
people who were stupid enough

1425
01:09:46,068 --> 01:09:49,071
to admire me as an enemy
of the government.

1426
01:09:51,075 --> 01:09:54,713
But we are not here
to discuss my virtues.

1427
01:09:54,714 --> 01:09:57,717
I have told you
all this, Mr. Thompson,

1428
01:09:57,718 --> 01:10:00,254
because I trust you,
and because, uh...

1429
01:10:00,255 --> 01:10:02,758
Well, as you say
in your country,

1430
01:10:02,759 --> 01:10:05,361
I want to
play ball on you.

1431
01:10:05,362 --> 01:10:07,599
You want
the negative.

1432
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,735
And you want your life.

1433
01:10:09,736 --> 01:10:12,271
It is not
a bad bargain.

1434
01:10:12,272 --> 01:10:14,241
Oh, I don't know.

1435
01:10:14,242 --> 01:10:17,245
I don't think my life
is worth that much.

1436
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:19,783
You are very modest,
Mr. Thompson.

1437
01:10:19,784 --> 01:10:21,786
How about
raising the ante?

1438
01:10:21,787 --> 01:10:24,790
I am willing, as you
say in your country,

1439
01:10:24,791 --> 01:10:27,293
to put my cards
under the table.

1440
01:10:27,294 --> 01:10:28,761
What do you want?

1441
01:10:28,762 --> 01:10:30,798
I have a wife
downstairs.

1442
01:10:30,799 --> 01:10:32,300
What is her crime?

1443
01:10:32,301 --> 01:10:34,805
Well, about
the only wrong thing

1444
01:10:34,806 --> 01:10:38,309
she's ever done in her
life is to admire Bastakoff.

1445
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:40,813
Ah, she admired
Bastakoff the philosopher.

1446
01:10:40,814 --> 01:10:44,217
Then she is an enemy of
Bastakoff the police commissar.

1447
01:10:44,218 --> 01:10:46,254
Too bad.
What is her name?

1448
01:10:46,255 --> 01:10:47,756
Yekhubitz.

1449
01:10:47,757 --> 01:10:49,725
Ah, yes.
Theodore.

1450
01:10:49,726 --> 01:10:51,261
An idiot.

1451
01:10:51,262 --> 01:10:53,263
Dangerously naive.

1452
01:10:53,264 --> 01:10:57,903
It is such people who keep
Russia in her idealistic rompers.

1453
01:10:57,904 --> 01:10:59,774
I want her
and her father.

1454
01:10:59,775 --> 01:11:01,275
Another idiot.

1455
01:11:01,276 --> 01:11:05,113
Listen, Bastakoff, you are, in
my opinion, not a judge of idiocy,

1456
01:11:05,114 --> 01:11:06,749
more a proof of it.

1457
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:10,789
Mr. Thompson, you have me
at a disadvantage.

1458
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:12,257
I must yield.

1459
01:11:13,628 --> 01:11:16,431
I'm sorry I blew up.
You'll let us out?

1460
01:11:16,432 --> 01:11:18,299
Yes.
You are all free.

1461
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,270
In addition, I forgive
you for being Comrade X.

1462
01:11:21,271 --> 01:11:23,807
Mr. Thompson, you have
made me very happy.

1463
01:11:23,808 --> 01:11:25,777
You have touched
a side of me

1464
01:11:25,778 --> 01:11:28,281
I didn't think remained
in the police commissar.

1465
01:11:28,282 --> 01:11:30,317
You trust me,
Mr. Thompson.

1466
01:11:30,318 --> 01:11:32,286
Oh, you're 100%,
Mr. Bastakoff.

1467
01:11:32,287 --> 01:11:33,822
I trust you, too.

1468
01:11:33,823 --> 01:11:36,325
I am placing my future
in your hands.

1469
01:11:36,326 --> 01:11:38,127
I won't let
you down, commissar.

1470
01:11:38,128 --> 01:11:39,831
I'll get the negative and send it

1471
01:11:39,832 --> 01:11:41,333
right back to you
with the bellboy.

1472
01:11:41,334 --> 01:11:42,501
Good.

1473
01:11:42,502 --> 01:11:44,771
I'll give the necessary
orders, Mr. Thompson,

1474
01:11:44,772 --> 01:11:47,241
to see that you are
not molested anymore.

1475
01:11:47,242 --> 01:11:50,279
You'll naturally say nothing
about all this to your newspaper.

1476
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,616
After what you've done?
Oh, not a peep!

1477
01:11:52,617 --> 01:11:54,285
I have your
word of honor?

1478
01:11:54,286 --> 01:11:57,422
As they say in my country,
you can count me out.

1479
01:11:57,423 --> 01:12:00,426
Thanks. I wish you much
happiness, Mr. Thompson.

1480
01:12:01,963 --> 01:12:04,732
The same to you,
Mr. Bastakoff.

1481
01:12:11,143 --> 01:12:12,611
Thank you,
Mr. Bastakoff.

1482
01:12:12,612 --> 01:12:14,112
Thank you,
Mr. Thompson.

1483
01:12:19,322 --> 01:12:22,291
Your friends will be out
immediately, Mr. Thompson.

1484
01:12:22,292 --> 01:12:24,795
The commissar himself
has ordered a taxicab.

1485
01:12:24,796 --> 01:12:26,164
Thanks.

1486
01:12:26,165 --> 01:12:28,333
Mr. Thompson,
what is this?

1487
01:12:28,334 --> 01:12:31,338
Why are they going to
shoot us in the street?

1488
01:12:31,339 --> 01:12:33,341
Everybody else got
shot in the Kremlin.

1489
01:12:33,342 --> 01:12:34,810
Yes. Well,
take it easy, Vanya.

1490
01:12:34,811 --> 01:12:36,511
They haven't
shot us...Yet.

1491
01:12:36,512 --> 01:12:37,780
Come on. Get in.

1492
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:41,352
Tell the commissar
thanks a lot.

1493
01:12:41,353 --> 01:12:42,854
It is nothing, sir.

1494
01:12:42,855 --> 01:12:44,189
That's what I think.

1495
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:49,764
Hotel ambassador.
Step on it.

1496
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:50,966
What happened?

1497
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:52,468
Bastakoff
saved our lives.

1498
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:53,970
Bastakoff?
Where is he?

1499
01:12:53,971 --> 01:12:55,972
In his office. He's
the new chief of police.

1500
01:12:55,973 --> 01:12:57,808
Vasiliev got pneumonia last night-

1501
01:12:57,809 --> 01:12:59,779
galloping pneumonia
with lead complications.

1502
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:02,282
You're telling me Bastakoff
is the police commissar? No.

1503
01:13:02,283 --> 01:13:03,751
He ain't
nothing else but.

1504
01:13:03,752 --> 01:13:06,254
Bastakoff is a poet,
not a policeman.

1505
01:13:06,255 --> 01:13:07,757
Then he's got
a dual personality.

1506
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:09,291
But those people
love him.

1507
01:13:09,292 --> 01:13:11,262
He wouldn't kill
people who love him.

1508
01:13:11,263 --> 01:13:13,799
All right. If you don't
believe me, ask him.

1509
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,300
Who's the new head
of the k.P.U.?

1510
01:13:18,139 --> 01:13:20,241
Tovarish
Bastakoff.

1511
01:13:22,311 --> 01:13:23,812
I don't understand.

1512
01:13:23,813 --> 01:13:25,816
Everybody loves
Bastakoff.

1513
01:13:25,817 --> 01:13:27,819
Bastakoff
kills everybody.

1514
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,922
Everything balances.

1515
01:13:29,923 --> 01:13:32,826
You know anyplace we could
stop and get a hot dog?

1516
01:13:37,767 --> 01:13:40,236
Sorry, old man, but this
is a capitalistic street.

1517
01:13:40,237 --> 01:13:44,009
Mr. Thompson, I would like
to know what's going on.

1518
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:46,279
Your pal Bastakoff's a
great little guy, baby.

1519
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,247
I told him I had some
evidence against him.

1520
01:13:48,248 --> 01:13:49,783
Soon as I
lead him to it,

1521
01:13:49,784 --> 01:13:51,921
he'll give me pneumonia, and you, too.

1522
01:13:51,922 --> 01:13:53,055
Where's the evidence?

1523
01:13:53,056 --> 01:13:54,490
In my pocket.
Soon as they see

1524
01:13:54,491 --> 01:13:56,460
we're not heading for the
hotel, they'll open up.

1525
01:13:56,461 --> 01:13:57,795
Get down.
We're turning off.

1526
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:07,309
Here they come.
Get down!

1527
01:14:16,288 --> 01:14:18,291
I think they are
catching up.

1528
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:19,794
Stay on the floor.

1529
01:15:01,321 --> 01:15:02,321
Come on!

1530
01:15:02,322 --> 01:15:04,291
Where? There is
no place to go.

1531
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:05,725
Come on, I say!

1532
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:09,765
Climb on!

1533
01:15:12,838 --> 01:15:15,105
Hurry up, pop.

1534
01:15:35,002 --> 01:15:37,037
What's the matter?
Is she hurt?

1535
01:15:37,038 --> 01:15:38,373
Terrible.

1536
01:15:38,374 --> 01:15:41,377
Here, here, here.
She sprain something?

1537
01:15:41,378 --> 01:15:43,580
Here, here,
here, honey.

1538
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:45,215
Her soul is dead.

1539
01:15:45,216 --> 01:15:48,453
Oh, that.

1540
01:15:48,454 --> 01:15:51,359
She doesn't want to live. She told me.

1541
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:54,329
Don't feel bad, honey.
We'll get out of this.

1542
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:57,333
Looks like a pretty rotten
world from where we sit,

1543
01:15:57,334 --> 01:15:59,335
full of murder
and double-cross

1544
01:15:59,336 --> 01:16:01,839
with a handful
of high-pressure boys

1545
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:04,810
peddling graveyards up and
down every street in europe.

1546
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:08,316
But I know a place where you
can still die of whooping cough.

1547
01:16:08,317 --> 01:16:11,353
What's the difference what you die of?

1548
01:16:11,354 --> 01:16:13,823
You die.
That's enough.

1549
01:16:13,824 --> 01:16:17,829
I, uh...I got
a confession to make.

1550
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:19,866
I lied to you.

1551
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:21,334
What about?

1552
01:16:21,335 --> 01:16:22,836
The u.S.A.

1553
01:16:22,837 --> 01:16:25,340
It ain't
a spiritual desert.

1554
01:16:25,341 --> 01:16:27,843
Say, it's pie a la mode,

1555
01:16:27,844 --> 01:16:30,882
two-pants suits
and the home of the brave,

1556
01:16:30,883 --> 01:16:32,850
pikes peak
and coney island.

1557
01:16:32,851 --> 01:16:36,056
And I told you wrong
about the Brooklyn Dodgers.

1558
01:16:36,057 --> 01:16:37,891
They finished
in second place.

1559
01:16:37,892 --> 01:16:41,363
How...how can
we get there?

1560
01:16:41,364 --> 01:16:42,865
We'll walk.

1561
01:16:45,103 --> 01:16:46,837
When this
percolator stops,

1562
01:16:46,838 --> 01:16:52,345
we'll get out and walk until
we fall down or get shot.

1563
01:16:52,346 --> 01:16:55,851
They're going to shoot
us on sight, anyway...

1564
01:16:55,852 --> 01:16:58,455
But they got to
see us first.

1565
01:17:35,107 --> 01:17:36,910
Looks like we're going
to have some visitors.

1566
01:17:36,911 --> 01:17:37,878
Who is it?

1567
01:17:37,879 --> 01:17:39,012
The Russian army.

1568
01:17:39,013 --> 01:17:40,248
What can we do?

1569
01:17:40,249 --> 01:17:42,651
I don't know. We're
a little outnumbered.

1570
01:17:42,652 --> 01:17:45,020
Somebody must have seen
us board the vodka limited.

1571
01:17:45,021 --> 01:17:46,856
No. They're
not searching for us.

1572
01:17:46,857 --> 01:17:47,891
They're not?

1573
01:17:47,892 --> 01:17:49,828
Look. They're Manning
the tanks. See?

1574
01:17:49,829 --> 01:17:51,364
3 in each tank.

1575
01:17:51,365 --> 01:17:52,765
What's that prove?

1576
01:17:52,766 --> 01:17:54,868
Don't you understand?
3 is a crew.

1577
01:17:54,869 --> 01:17:56,871
At school, we had 4:

1578
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:59,208
Pilot, copilot,
co-copilot, co-co-copilot.

1579
01:17:59,209 --> 01:18:00,376
Quit stuttering.

1580
01:18:00,377 --> 01:18:03,381
Say, you mean you know
how this thing ticks?

1581
01:18:03,382 --> 01:18:06,852
A little. I went to night
school for tank maneuvers.

1582
01:18:10,392 --> 01:18:11,892
Get in that seat,
honey.

1583
01:18:11,893 --> 01:18:14,396
You're going to do
a little homework.

1584
01:18:25,246 --> 01:18:26,213
Ooh!

1585
01:18:36,929 --> 01:18:37,996
Ooh!

1586
01:18:45,375 --> 01:18:48,879
No, no, no. Tell him to
get down on the floor.

1587
01:18:53,887 --> 01:18:55,789
All right.
Tie him up.

1588
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:03,267
Ok, Lizzie,
let her go!

1589
01:19:20,927 --> 01:19:22,895
See those tanks?
Head over there

1590
01:19:22,896 --> 01:19:25,899
like you're going to take
a place in their formation.

1591
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:27,935
Then when I
give you the word,

1592
01:19:27,936 --> 01:19:29,437
start edging over
toward those trees.

1593
01:19:29,438 --> 01:19:30,806
Make it slow, though.

1594
01:19:35,714 --> 01:19:37,549
General bobinski!

1595
01:20:28,290 --> 01:20:31,626
Oh!
We are killed!

1596
01:20:31,627 --> 01:20:33,062
What's the matter?

1597
01:20:33,063 --> 01:20:34,463
They are coming!

1598
01:20:35,566 --> 01:20:36,700
Step on it!

1599
01:20:36,701 --> 01:20:38,036
Step on what?

1600
01:20:38,037 --> 01:20:39,203
Go faster!

1601
01:20:39,204 --> 01:20:41,174
This is the fastest
I can go.

1602
01:20:41,175 --> 01:20:42,709
Wait a minute.
Now I remember.

1603
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:44,045
This is for speed.

1604
01:20:46,382 --> 01:20:48,083
Hey, we've stopped!

1605
01:20:48,084 --> 01:20:50,086
Let me have a bang
at this tractor.

1606
01:20:57,699 --> 01:20:59,834
I'm playing
hide-and-go-seek, honey.

1607
01:20:59,835 --> 01:21:01,936
We're going to sit
in those bushes for a while.

1608
01:21:22,501 --> 01:21:25,404
So long, fellas.
Have a nice trip.

1609
01:21:25,405 --> 01:21:28,508
Well, we did it, honey.
We gave them the slip.

1610
01:22:15,277 --> 01:22:16,276
Oh! We are killed!

1611
01:22:17,179 --> 01:22:19,047
It's true!
Here they come!

1612
01:22:19,048 --> 01:22:20,048
Who?

1613
01:22:20,049 --> 01:22:22,351
The tanks. They
must have seen us.

1614
01:22:22,352 --> 01:22:23,554
Holy ike!

1615
01:22:54,166 --> 01:22:55,967
Mac!

1616
01:23:30,417 --> 01:23:33,755
Hurry!
Hurry up, Mr. Thompson!

1617
01:23:33,756 --> 01:23:35,558
This muzhik
is biting!

1618
01:23:35,559 --> 01:23:37,159
Well, bite him back!

1619
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:45,305
Hey, can't you dodge
those trees, Lizzie?

1620
01:23:50,513 --> 01:23:52,048
You see anything?

1621
01:23:52,049 --> 01:23:55,152
Nothing. Not a soul.
We are safe now.

1622
01:23:58,725 --> 01:24:00,694
Look!

1623
01:24:04,633 --> 01:24:06,034
Hey, come here!

1624
01:24:09,206 --> 01:24:10,440
Vanya, come here!

1625
01:24:10,441 --> 01:24:12,077
I see nothing.

1626
01:24:12,078 --> 01:24:14,981
That's
what's there, all right.

1627
01:24:14,982 --> 01:24:16,048
Come here!

1628
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:22,825
We're cornered,
trapped like rats in Russia.

1629
01:24:22,826 --> 01:24:24,894
Oh, my glasses.

1630
01:24:29,335 --> 01:24:30,870
Hey! Hey, come here!

1631
01:24:34,609 --> 01:24:36,611
What shall we do now?

1632
01:24:36,612 --> 01:24:39,081
Stay back here
as far as you can.

1633
01:24:39,082 --> 01:24:42,487
Pray that I get this thing
in reverse the first time.

1634
01:24:48,062 --> 01:24:49,562
What did he say?

1635
01:24:49,563 --> 01:24:52,067
He said, "this is general
bobinski. Come quick."

1636
01:24:52,068 --> 01:24:53,569
Turn on
that radio.

1637
01:25:01,548 --> 01:25:03,082
What's that say?

1638
01:25:03,083 --> 01:25:05,086
He said, "lead on,
general bobinski.

1639
01:25:05,087 --> 01:25:07,589
We are with you
to the last man!"

1640
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:10,560
You understand? We're
in the general's tank.

1641
01:25:10,561 --> 01:25:13,397
They're not chasing us.
They're following us!

1642
01:25:13,398 --> 01:25:14,598
Following us?

1643
01:25:14,599 --> 01:25:15,734
Yes.

1644
01:25:15,735 --> 01:25:17,103
Holy ike.

1645
01:25:17,104 --> 01:25:18,605
That's wonderful!

1646
01:25:18,606 --> 01:25:20,574
Well, sit down,
kids,

1647
01:25:20,575 --> 01:25:22,610
and make yourselves
comfortable.

1648
01:25:22,611 --> 01:25:24,613
From now on,
we can relax.

1649
01:25:29,488 --> 01:25:33,126
Now, I'll just back this
kiddie car off this tightrope,

1650
01:25:33,127 --> 01:25:35,129
and everything will be
clear sailing.

1651
01:25:37,934 --> 01:25:39,768
I love you,
Mr. Thompson.

1652
01:25:39,769 --> 01:25:41,237
You have saved us.

1653
01:26:28,706 --> 01:26:31,142
We are
at dneister river.

1654
01:26:31,143 --> 01:26:32,877
On the other side
is rumania.

1655
01:26:32,878 --> 01:26:36,818
They have promised not to
go into rumania right now.

1656
01:26:36,819 --> 01:26:38,119
Oh, oh.

1657
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:40,155
Well, hold on
to your hats, boys.

1658
01:26:40,156 --> 01:26:42,625
Here's where Russia
breaks another promise.

1659
01:26:56,146 --> 01:26:59,583
May I ask, Mr.
Thompson, where are we going?

1660
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:01,118
Hold your breath,
Vanya.

1661
01:27:01,119 --> 01:27:02,688
We're
in the Navy now.

1662
01:27:23,719 --> 01:27:28,156
Mr. Thompson, they are going to
follow us all the way to america!

1663
01:27:28,157 --> 01:27:29,660
Oh, no, they're not.

1664
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:31,630
I got it.
Get on that radio.

1665
01:27:31,631 --> 01:27:33,665
Tell them to turn
back to the border

1666
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:35,468
and wait for
further instruction.

1667
01:27:35,469 --> 01:27:36,836
Yes. All right.

1668
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:07,614
What will we do now?

1669
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:10,151
We're going to get captured,
interned, and released

1670
01:28:10,152 --> 01:28:11,620
by the American
consul.

1671
01:28:11,621 --> 01:28:13,421
How do you say "surrender" in Rumanian?

1672
01:28:13,457 --> 01:28:14,457
Capitulum.

1673
01:28:14,458 --> 01:28:15,258
Capitulum?

1674
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:16,200
Yes.

1675
01:28:16,296 --> 01:28:17,498
‚ô™ Capitulum,
capituli ‚ô™

1676
01:28:17,499 --> 01:28:20,567
‚ô™ capituli,
capitulum ‚ô™

1677
01:28:20,568 --> 01:28:21,936
‚ô™ joy is
everywhere ‚ô™

1678
01:28:21,937 --> 01:28:24,472
‚ô™ capituli,
capitulum ‚ô™

1679
01:28:42,365 --> 01:28:44,934
It's going to be tough to
surrender to these people.

1680
01:28:44,935 --> 01:28:46,370
You got to
catch them first.

1681
01:29:09,571 --> 01:29:12,807
Go on!
Go on to third!

1682
01:29:12,808 --> 01:29:14,978
The home run!
Come on, Brooklyn!

1683
01:29:14,979 --> 01:29:17,515
May I ask
what is going on?

1684
01:29:17,516 --> 01:29:19,718
The Dodgers are
murdering the Reds!

1685
01:29:19,719 --> 01:29:20,986
Aha!

1686
01:29:20,987 --> 01:29:23,089
The counterrevolution!
