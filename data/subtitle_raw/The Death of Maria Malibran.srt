1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:09,000
THE DEATH OF MARIA MALIBRAN.

2
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,592
Every day
the lovely daughter of the Sultan

3
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,793
took a walk in the evening

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,310
at the fountain
where the pale waters play.

5
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,877
Daily stood the youthful slave,
in the evening

6
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,108
at the fountain
where the pale waters play.

7
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,393
Daily he grew pale and paler.

8
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,719
Then one evening came
the princess to him,

9
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,117
speaking rapid words:

10
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,348
"Tell me what your name is,
where you come from, your clan!"

11
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,712
And the slave spoke:
"know then Mohammed am l.

12
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,879
I come from Yemen
and my clan is that of Asra,

13
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,117
who must die
whenever they love.

14
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:47,960
And my clan is that of Asra,
who must die whenever they love.

15
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,111
The mad woman comes prancing

16
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,231
vaguely remembering
something from her past.

17
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,837
The children mock and stone her

18
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,759
as if she were a blackbird.

19
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,515
She raises her stick

20
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,710
and threatens to pursue them

21
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,716
but then she goes her way.

22
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,318
On the way she loses a shoe,

23
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,150
but she does not notice.

24
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,830
Long spider legs
move about her neck,

25
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,318
but it is just her hair.

26
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,989
Her visage
has no human features

27
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,153
and she suddenly
bursts out laughing

28
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,716
Iike a hyena.

29
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,955
She mumbles
scraps of phrases

30
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:58,475
which very few could make sense of,
even if they were to try.

31
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,432
Her skirt,
full of holes,

32
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,595
jerks about her scrawny,
dirt-spattered legs.

33
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,710
She goes on her way,

34
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,955
borne away like a poplar leaf.

35
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,358
She,
her youth,

36
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,754
her hopes and former happiness,

37
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,838
on which she looks back
through the mist of her mind,

38
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,397
shattered by the turmoil
of unarmed powers.

39
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,350
Her gracefulness is gone,

40
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,676
her former beauty.

41
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,716
Her gait is crude

42
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,309
and her breath reeks of brandy.

43
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,553
If people were happy on this earth,

44
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,070
it would astonish us.

45
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,674
The mad woman
reproaches no one.

46
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,472
She is too proud

47
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,592
to complain,
and will die

48
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,158
without revealing her secret
to those who are interested in her.

49
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,517
But she has forbidden them

50
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,116
to address one word to her.

51
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,278
The children pursue and stone her

52
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,320
as if she were a blackbird.

53
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,278
She has dropped a roll of paper
from her bosom.

54
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,350
A stranger picks it up,

55
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,309
Iocks himself up at night

56
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,875
and reads the manuscript

57
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,036
which runs as follows:

58
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,230
But when you say
I love you

59
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,876
my eyes are filled
with bitter tears.

60
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,196
Let me

61
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,792
in to you

62
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,356
before it is

63
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,558
too late.

64
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,835
Your longing
means nothing to me.

65
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,595
The apparition vanishes.

66
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,989
I seek the laws.

67
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,639
When you embrace me
I experience humility,

68
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,551
and can bear without pain
your esteem of me.

69
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,832
She is dead.

70
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,359
Maria!

71
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,078
I implore you, God of Love,
take her in your arms.

72
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,309
A sailor dressed in white
walked along the road

73
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,910
with the rolling gait
of a seaman.

74
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,796
I looked at him
without really knowing why.

75
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,233
He was much younger
than I had ever been,

76
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,996
and more handsome and fairer.

77
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,869
And his manliness
was so evident

78
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:38,756
that I felt
a moment"s pang.

79
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,510
Our paths crossed,

80
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,555
and as if he had seen
a tell-tale flicker in my eyes,

81
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,912
he cast me a knowing,
inviting glance.

82
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,080
Such a glance as he probably cast

83
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,717
at any of those carefully made-up

84
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,878
habitués of the cafés.

85
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,229
If this glance
had lasted one more second

86
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,151
words would surely
have been spoken

87
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,831
Iike the usual thing:
Hey, baby, don"t I know you?

88
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,472
My face glowed
and my heart was in my mouth

89
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:27,436
as I hurried on
and tried to stare in front of me.

90
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,671
He had caught me unawares
for a moment

91
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,759
because I had not
really thought of him,

92
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,990
but of the letter in my pocket

93
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,916
and of Helmut.

94
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,630
As I crossed the street

95
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,995
I wondered what
he could have seen in me.

96
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,475
I was no longer so young
as to believe

97
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:57,310
my walk or the way I held my hands
could have attracted him.

98
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,750
No,
it had to be something else,

99
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,470
something I dared not
look in the eye.

100
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,436
For that would be
like looking into the dazzling sun!

101
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,072
Something I dared not
look in the eye.

102
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,917
For that would be
like looking into the dazzling sun!

103
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,556
It was half past nine

104
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,952
and he hoped
to be home by ten.

105
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:24,353
It was very presumptuous of him

106
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,558
to act as if he were sure

107
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,716
of knowing the future.

108
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,152
It was very presumptuous of him

109
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:42,354
to act as if he were sure

110
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,552
of knowing the future.

111
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:56,680
Might some unforeseen obstacle
bar his path?

112
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,959
And would such circumstances

113
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,435
be so extraordinary

114
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:09,200
that he dared interpret it
as an exception?

115
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,714
Why does he not consider it rather

116
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,196
an abnormal fact

117
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:23,674
that so far he had been able
to feel free of unease,

118
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,636
and happy,
so to speak?

119
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,879
Indeed,

120
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:35,512
with what right could he say

121
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:39,072
he would reach home unharmed,

122
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:44,075
if someone
watched and followed him

123
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,158
as if he were their future prey?

124
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,989
I long for you so much!

125
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:01,079
I long for you so much!

126
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,069
This means death for me.

127
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,070
This means death for me.

128
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,757
Judgments on people

129
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:07,032
are more valuable

130
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:10,312
than the people themselves.

131
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,788
If I allow people

132
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,352
to despise me

133
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:26,277
they should not forget to say

134
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,711
that this is all

135
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:37,029
I can do for them.

136
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,350
What shall I do now?

137
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:01,316
What shall I do now?

138
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:41,197
I should not have given him

139
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,670
my love!

140
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,236
He is dead!

141
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,316
He is dead!

142
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,995
Let's put it off till tomorrow.

143
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,150
Let's put it off till tomorrow.

144
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,875
Let's put it off till tomorrow.

145
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:40,669
FEDERlCO GARClA,
MARlA MALlBRAN"S FATHER.

146
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,790
God be with you.

147
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,836
God be with you.

148
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,996
Where are you bound?

149
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,236
For Eisenstadt.

150
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:31,510
Then we can
keep each other company.

151
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:41,151
I think that for a young man

152
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:45,114
the best way
of meeting his needs

153
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,955
is to ply the needle.

154
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:52,439
To bind the tread
of firm footwear

155
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,793
is the noblest task
of a southerner.

156
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:00,559
But it is my belief
that the article I deal in

157
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,555
is equivalent to fine,
warm clothing.

158
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:08,916
Clothing the naked is senseless,

159
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,715
for I know that the tread
of he who wears my footwear

160
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,876
is so firm

161
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,634
that he needs no warmth.

162
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,755
I would advise you
to get a stock of provisions.

163
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:19,273
For my part, I shall obtain enough bread
in that hamlet.

164
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:24,033
The way is short. We shall
reach our destination before dusk.

165
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,270
I am not afraid, Hugo.

166
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,990
You will regret it!

167
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,396
If you give me

168
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:06,913
one of your bright blue eyes

169
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,998
I will give you

170
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:16,235
something to eat.

171
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:23,749
You may eat your fill

172
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:28,670
but in return,
I will pluck out an eye.

173
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,790
Where are we?

174
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,909
In a place

175
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:46,398
where you may finally rest.

176
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:55,599
There is an alder by the pond.
A blue flower grows at its roots.

177
01:18:55,800 --> 01:18:58,758
Whoever makes a potion of it
and gives it to a sick man

178
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,393
would soon make him whole.

179
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:05,720
You know many things, but my science
is greater and could help many.

180
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,151
In the capital they're dying of drought,
the fools!

181
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,954
Yet they could have enough water.

182
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:15,630
But how?
- Before the east gate stands a beech.

183
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,796
A white horse browses on its leaves.

184
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:20,759
Ride the horse
thrice around the market place

185
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,191
so that sparks fly!
And you?

186
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,233
All the blind
could see again at once

187
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:31,319
if they washed their eyes
with this morning's dew!

188
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,396
I can

189
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,558
see again!

190
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:55,316
If you give me one of your eyes...

191
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,796
I don"t know you.

192
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,590
I have never been here before.

193
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:35,516
I am a singer.

194
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,316
You, too?

195
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,396
I"m a singer, too.

196
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,554
I"m a singer, too.

197
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,830
Perhaps we shall meet again.

198
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:05,315
IN THE YEAR 1814.

199
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,390
When your foot slides over a frog,

200
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:11,956
you feel disgust.

201
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:18,630
But if you run your finger
just lightly over a human body,

202
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:24,515
the skin of your finger will crack
like the scales of a slab of mica,

203
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,956
shattered with a hammer.

204
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:42,833
And like the heart of a shark,
already an hour dead,

205
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:46,396
still beats on
the bridge tenaciously.

206
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:51,158
Thus our innards still writhe
long after being touched,

207
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,669
to the last fibers.

208
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,834
So great is the horror

209
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:02,033
inspired by man
in his fellow man.

210
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,916
So great is the horror

211
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:17,030
inspired by man
in his fellow man!

212
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:43,674
The ancient temple of Denderah

213
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:46,599
Iies one and a half hours

214
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,792
from the left bank of the Nile!

215
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:54,793
Today,
countless multitudes of wasps

216
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,629
have invaded the waters and roads
along the banks!

217
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,596
They swarm about the columns

218
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,993
Iike the dense waves
of a black head of hair!

219
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:11,875
The only inhabitants
of the cold aisle,

220
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:15,117
they guard
the entrance to the forecourts

221
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:19,518
as if it were their inherited right!

222
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:24,877
I compare the buzzing
of their metallic wings

223
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:28,959
with the ceaseless grinding
of ice floes

224
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:33,990
that clash during the ice thaw
in the Arctic seas!

225
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:39,556
But when I think
of the behavior of him,

226
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:44,311
whom providence granted
the throne of this earth,

227
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:49,276
the three wing-tips of my pain

228
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:54,436
resound with a louder buzzing!

229
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:01,036
But he is dead.

230
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,070
Maria,
he is dead,

231
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,236
dead, dead,

232
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:08,388
dead.

233
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:36,155
EVEN HlS GRAVE lS HlDDEN FROM ME.

234
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:05,878
TEN YEARS LATER.

235
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,756
Can you

236
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:40,429
imagine it?

237
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:14,150
I am not aware of any guilt.

238
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:36,034
I say it for the last time,
l"ll not work with him anymore.

239
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:39,678
But please,
I only want the best for you,

240
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,632
the best for you.

241
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:45,276
I cannot work
with Federico anymore.

242
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:48,593
I do not want to,
nor can l.

243
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,756
I can"t!
- Please, Madame Malibran.

244
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:52,916
You must sing.
- lt"s impossible!

245
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,076
You promised.
- It is madness!

246
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:58,192
It is madness to force me!

247
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,430
Madame Malibran,

248
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:00,113
your daughter
has just taken her own life.

249
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,874
Now no one can compel you anymore

250
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:48,676
but I tell you,
it"s for your own good!

251
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:54,958
You must do it,
even if only for my sake!

252
01:38:56,120 --> 01:39:02,798
Soon you will be
an angel in heaven.

253
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:30,631
I shall die,
but my death will avenge me at least!

254
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:35,638
I shall not die alone
and someone will follow me.

255
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,516
