1
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,352
I can't ask anymore from you.

2
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,665
No coach could.

3
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:24,432
Nobody.

4
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:26,102
And you'll win or not because of this,

5
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:28,360
because of who you are,
and how special you are.

6
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:30,808
How special you are to me.

7
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,344
You will win tonight.

8
00:00:37,143 --> 00:00:39,535
Because it's meant to be.

9
00:00:42,646 --> 00:00:45,453
<i>Good morning!
It's 65 in Oklahoma City.</i>

10
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:46,873
<i>Feels like 99 this morning.</i>

11
00:00:46,898 --> 00:00:49,439
<i>And you'll dive in heatwave,
worry nothing.</i>

12
00:00:56,465 --> 00:01:00,353
<i>...given up, but he will appear on
the South Dakota ballot this Fall.</i>

13
00:01:00,378 --> 00:01:01,886
<i>Republican presidential nominee,</i>

14
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:04,696
<i>Barry Goldwater,

15
00:01:08,806 --> 00:01:12,322
<i>♪ Come to Mommy, darling ♪</i>

16
00:01:12,389 --> 00:01:17,587

<i>♪ Daddy's gone to heaven ♪</i>

18
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:25,928
<i>♪ Way up in the sky ♪</i>

19
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:29,998
<i>It's KADA farm report,</i>

20
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:33,141
<i>brought to you by
the Wimbash Funeral Home.</i>

21
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,000
<i>This lousy drought,</i>

22
00:01:36,754 --> 00:01:38,254
<i>that about says it all.</i>

23
00:01:38,279 --> 00:01:41,838
<i>With hogs and feeder cow
prices down 8 percent.</i>

24
00:01:41,863 --> 00:01:44,517
<i>Goat wheat down 2 cents to 2.32.</i>

25
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,440
<i>Milo at 2.48.</i>

26
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:49,623
<i>Corn 1.09 to 1.29 a bushel.</i>

27
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:50,773
<i>Grape at 41.</i>

28
00:01:50,798 --> 00:01:53,976
<i>Four-leaf staple cotton

29
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:56,255
<i>Heat is still in the 100's every day,</i>

30
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,326
<i>and boy, that humidity.</i>

31
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:00,173
<i>But hey, look on the bright side.</i>

32
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:02,942
<i>Our FFV Chapter was named winner...</i>

33
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:05,347
<i>in the State Farm safety contest.</i>

34
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:06,647
<i>How about that?</i>

35
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:08,274
<i>We also took second...</i>

36
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:11,661
<i>in the electrification contests
for the southwest district.</i>

37
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:13,220
<i>So, don't tell old Jerry Dodd...</i>

38
00:02:13,245 --> 00:02:15,537
<i>that things ain't looking up
in Middletown.</i>

39
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:17,136
<i>In other local excitement is too.</i>

40
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:19,786
<i>The football of junior high
that goes to extreme.</i>

41
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:22,454
Hey, easy on Mama's table.

42
00:02:22,617 --> 00:02:24,913
You boys be careful with that.

43
00:02:24,943 --> 00:02:26,414
Yes, sir.

44
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:28,775
Now, I know
it's not as nice as I...

45
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,048
- I, I made it seem.
- Shh!

46
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:33,108
It's our very own first home.

47
00:02:33,133 --> 00:02:34,950
Jean, are you sure
you're gonna be okay...

48
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:36,225
- with all this?
- Honey, stop.

49
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,384
- Stop worrying.
- I mean, it's not...

50
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:39,156
- Shh!
- what you used to.

51
00:02:39,181 --> 00:02:40,250
I'm sure.

52
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:41,953
Yes. It's...

53
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,072
it's what you worked so hard for.

54
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:49,635
I think, it's gonna be lucky here.

55
00:03:18,618 --> 00:03:20,656
Clayton Driscoll from Fairfield,

56
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:22,237
Miss Rogers, reporting for duty.

57
00:03:22,262 --> 00:03:24,564
- Just a minute, spooky dear.
- Good Lord.

58
00:03:24,589 --> 00:03:27,899
How long does it take
to find the budget?

59
00:03:28,494 --> 00:03:30,060
I got places to go.

60
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:31,148
B, Miss Rogers.

61
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:32,543
- B for budget.
- Yes, sir.

62
00:03:32,568 --> 00:03:35,118
Now, how many times I'm gonna
have to point this out to you?

63
00:03:35,143 --> 00:03:36,872
- Yes, sir.
- Never again.

64
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:38,158
John has his own system.

65
00:03:38,183 --> 00:03:39,364
Just, just give her a second.

66
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:42,707
Principal Moreland, Clayton Driscoll,
the new boys basketball coach.

67
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:46,059
Oh, here, I found them
where I looked the first time.

68
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:48,017
Excuse me, excuse me.

69
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,887
I'm supposed to see Mr. Bannister.

70
00:03:49,912 --> 00:03:52,152
- Ellis, this is Clayton Driscoll.
- I, I know who he is.

71
00:03:52,177 --> 00:03:53,663
Just sit down, son.
Take a seat.

72
00:03:53,688 --> 00:03:55,473
Wait your turn like everybody else.

73
00:03:55,504 --> 00:03:58,858
And, uh, you're not
the new boys basketball coach.

74
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,250
Job went to somebody
better qualified.

75
00:04:07,507 --> 00:04:09,085
Driscoll, wait!

76
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:10,640
Hold on!

77
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:12,426
Driscoll!

78
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,109
John Bannister had
a heart attack yesterday.

79
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:19,135
Bad one.

80
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,378
He's in the hospital.

81
00:04:20,403 --> 00:04:22,266
- Will you stop by my house, Susan?
- I will.

82
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:23,664
Two young kids.

83
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,728
We're all turned around.

84
00:04:26,197 --> 00:04:27,325
Oh!

85
00:04:27,356 --> 00:04:29,632
I'm sorry, Mr. Moreland.
I didn't know.

86
00:04:29,657 --> 00:04:31,000
But, that man in there,

87
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:32,703
- he was--
- I, I know, I know.

88
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:34,579
It was wrong how he did that.

89
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,327
That's just his way.

90
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:37,773
Ellis Brawley.

91
00:04:37,798 --> 00:04:39,826
He runs the school board.

92
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,820
And most everything else
around here.

93
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:43,764
His family has forever.

94
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:45,672
What's he mean about me not coaching?

95
00:04:45,697 --> 00:04:47,282
Well, you, you know, uh,

96
00:04:47,307 --> 00:04:49,293
big Vern Hooper, played at OU?

97
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:50,743
- Yeah.
- Well.

98
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:53,200
He's who Brawley hired
to coach boys.

99
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:55,491
He's, he's a nephew of George Brand.

100
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,185
President of Brawley's bank.

101
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,396
Deacon at his church.

102
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:00,112
Brand's on the school board too.

103
00:05:00,137 --> 00:05:01,917
He can't do that.
I got contracts.

104
00:05:01,942 --> 00:05:03,640
That's right.
Nothing's changed.

105
00:05:03,672 --> 00:05:04,977
That's good part.

106
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:06,354
You're still a coach.

107
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:08,051
Teaching history.

108
00:05:08,164 --> 00:05:09,301
Same salary.

109
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:11,533
Jean's got a job
over the county agent.

110
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:12,700
I'm still coaching.

111
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:14,342
That's right.

112
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,910
Well, who then?

113
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:25,433
You out of your mind?

114
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,781
- Just, now, wait.
- No!

115
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:29,189
- Just wait till Bannister's back.
- Are you kidding me? No!

116
00:05:29,214 --> 00:05:31,804
Me, coach girls basketball?

117
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:33,394
Clay!

118
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:36,413
Not for a million dollars,
Mr. Moreland.

119
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,905
<i>Just check the contract.</i>

120
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,643
I'm sure it says: History teacher
and boys basketball coach.

121
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:43,678
<i>But, it's got to say: Boys.</i>

122
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:44,997
Oh, man!

123
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:46,365
Just plain coach.

124
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:48,618
<i>Oh, Jesus! I sure wish
I had something, Clay.</i>

125
00:05:48,643 --> 00:05:49,780
<i>But, it's September.</i>

126
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:51,203
<i>We're all hired up.</i>

127
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:52,718
<i>Hey, try Farrell Handerson.</i>

128
00:05:52,743 --> 00:05:54,259
I already did.

129
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:56,101
Thanks, Joe.

130
00:05:59,732 --> 00:06:02,458
Why me, Jean?
Why me?

131
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:05,425
- Seven years, second fiddle.
- I know.

132
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:07,167
- I finally get my shot.
- I know.

133
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,259
- I know.
- And now, this?

134
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,383
And I know you.

135
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:11,318
And I know
you'll make this work.

136
00:06:11,343 --> 00:06:13,616
I don't wanna coach girls.

137
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:16,108
I think, Mrs. Bannister...

138
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:18,735
and her children got
a way worse deal than us.

139
00:06:18,785 --> 00:06:21,116
And what's wrong with girls?

140
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:23,191
Didn't I play girls basketball?

141
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:24,662
Not here, you didn't.

142
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:27,556
Here, it's a joke.
I went around and I asked.

143
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:30,419
What did Joe Brody say?

144
00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:35,584
Go see Bannister
when he gets better.

145
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:38,330
He hired me, he'll make it right.

146
00:06:38,512 --> 00:06:40,612
It's good advice.

147
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:46,448
What if he doesn't get better?

148
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,494
Did he really say: Ball?

149
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:19,602
Is this girls basketball?

150
00:07:22,726 --> 00:07:24,315
Yes, it is.

151
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:25,893
And I'm Mr. Driscoll.

152
00:07:25,935 --> 00:07:27,426
I'm the new--

153
00:07:28,923 --> 00:07:30,545
Sorry.

154
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:33,176
I'm the new coach.

155
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:36,888
Go get dressed.

156
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:38,232
We only got an hour
before lunch.

157
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,567
Come on, now.

158
00:07:41,817 --> 00:07:43,229
Come on, now.

159
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:49,953
Up!

160
00:07:52,963 --> 00:07:55,764
It's, it's right, 2 times, over.

161
00:07:55,821 --> 00:07:57,135
Two times.

162
00:07:57,207 --> 00:07:58,349
One,

163
00:07:58,397 --> 00:07:59,484
two,

164
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:00,579
over.

165
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:02,067
Helen, pay attention.

166
00:08:02,092 --> 00:08:04,061
Quit laughing, Helen.

167
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:15,174
One, two, over!

168
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,716
One, two, over!

169
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:25,770
You just pass the ball.
When you get the ball, pass it.

170
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:27,068
Next screen. Come on.

171
00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:28,348
Pass. Go behind.

172
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:29,734
Pass. Go behind.

173
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,914
Pass. Go behind.

174
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:32,660
Pass. Go behind.

175
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:37,206
You alright?

176
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:39,055
You sure? Alright.

177
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,250
It's not fun move.

178
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:41,310
It's anything but funny.

179
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:42,383
Hey, relax, Coach.

180
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:44,488
It's not like it's
for real or anything.

181
00:08:44,513 --> 00:08:45,639
Get out now.

182
00:08:45,664 --> 00:08:47,354
Nobody ever said,
they couldn't watch.

183
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:48,627
Thought, it was a free country.

184
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:49,920
Not from 11 to 12, to me.

185
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:51,298
Come on.
Next screen, come on.

186
00:08:51,337 --> 00:08:52,602
Pass. Go behind.

187
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:53,656
Pass. Go behind.

188
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:54,700
Pass. Not bad.

189
00:08:54,725 --> 00:08:55,735
Pass.

190
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,990
Next drill.

191
00:08:57,015 --> 00:08:58,646
Get the ball.
Get the ball, get the ball.

192
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,770
Get the ball.
Get the ball!

193
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,684
Women get to be fast!

194
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,215
And rebounding.

195
00:09:03,247 --> 00:09:04,817
That means "conditioning".

196
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:06,348
Too slow now.
Pick it up.

197
00:09:06,373 --> 00:09:09,020
You're gonna be in
the best shape in your lives.

198
00:09:09,099 --> 00:09:11,075
No one's gonna out-hustle you.

199
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:12,497
Come on, bring it home.

200
00:09:12,522 --> 00:09:13,692
Come on.

201
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,162
Helen, some time today.

202
00:09:17,606 --> 00:09:20,685
My daddy says,
you're supposed to coach boys.

203
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,358
You don't even want this job.

204
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,539
He says, you'd never been
a head coach before.

205
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,101
Your daddy has a lot to say.

206
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:27,593
He works for Mr. Brawley.

207
00:09:27,618 --> 00:09:28,982
He runs his oil company,

208
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:30,887
and likes me to shoot a lot.

209
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:32,476
Well, that's good to know.

210
00:09:32,515 --> 00:09:34,693
I want five baseline laps,

211
00:09:34,718 --> 00:09:38,182
and 20 more free-throws before lunch!

212
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,894
Come on now.

213
00:09:52,517 --> 00:09:55,179
Well, three more quit today.

214
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:58,790
All I got is 8 girls
to start the season with.

215
00:10:00,862 --> 00:10:03,404
Mr. Moreland called me
into his office.

216
00:10:03,432 --> 00:10:04,623
Mm-hm.

217
00:10:04,722 --> 00:10:06,473
Their daddies aren't happy.

218
00:10:06,498 --> 00:10:07,990
And neither is Mr. Brawley.

219
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:09,964
He made a point of it.

220
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:12,097
It's the drought.

221
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:14,461
Clay, it's got everybody upset.

222
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,748
Yeah, he said that to.

223
00:10:16,978 --> 00:10:19,731
Mr. Moreland knows
what you're up against.

224
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:22,599
It's a different challenge with girls.

225
00:10:23,263 --> 00:10:24,798
Jean,

226
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:28,647
I only know one way to coach.

227
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:31,303
Yeah?

228
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,551
Well, you know,
there's only one color of red,

229
00:10:33,577 --> 00:10:36,400
but a whole world
of different shades.

230
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:40,294
Stop being so damn wise.

231
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:54,269
Okay, I want, I want
patience on offense.

232
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:56,333
Alright now, constant motion
using those screens,

233
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:57,687
and get the ball down low.

234
00:10:57,725 --> 00:11:00,153
Now, uh, on, on defense,
we're gonna start man-to-man,

235
00:11:00,178 --> 00:11:01,233
and fall back to a zone.

236
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:03,091
I want 2-3, depending on those matches.

237
00:11:03,116 --> 00:11:05,542
Now, always look for motion.
You're always looking for the screens.

238
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:07,574
Now, we have no size.
That means, we have no depth.

239
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:09,589
We have no depth means,
if you foul, you're out.

240
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:11,474
I can't have that.
So, be, be tough.

241
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:13,272
But, but be smart about fouls.

242
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,979
Don't foul.

243
00:11:15,378 --> 00:11:16,923
Questions?

244
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,407
Questions?

245
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:22,493
Questions?

246
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,225
No questions?

247
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:34,132
Alright, look, uh, look,

248
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:36,144
I, I know I've been tough.

249
00:11:36,191 --> 00:11:38,935
And probably, a lot less
forgiving than you used to.

250
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:40,678
But, uh, um...

251
00:11:41,173 --> 00:11:43,718
that's, that's, that's who I am.

252
00:11:45,076 --> 00:11:47,349
I never had a break
in my whole life.

253
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:50,445
And I wasn't born with
much talent, only will.

254
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:53,230
So, I had to work my tail off at it.

255
00:11:55,475 --> 00:11:57,435
Winning came hard.

256
00:11:57,903 --> 00:12:00,671
But, it sure felt better than losing.

257
00:12:00,943 --> 00:12:02,298
It's, uh,

258
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,650
it's all I know.

259
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,156
It's all I could share.

260
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:06,444
Coach,

261
00:12:06,486 --> 00:12:08,968
you can't yell loud enough
to run me off.

262
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:12,038
I've been playing three years,
and we've never won nothing.

263
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,629
I stink and I know it.

264
00:12:13,654 --> 00:12:14,725
But...

265
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:16,117
I like the way you coach...

266
00:12:16,142 --> 00:12:18,717
'cause, even though,
we're not boys, you still care.

267
00:12:18,742 --> 00:12:19,855
So,

268
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,348
play me or not,
but don't worry,

269
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:24,008
I'm staying.

270
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,195
Me too.

271
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,577
Me too.

272
00:12:29,451 --> 00:12:31,543
Me too.

273
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,859
Come on. Follow me.

274
00:12:37,366 --> 00:12:39,036
Oh, no, no, no.
Come on, come on.

275
00:12:39,061 --> 00:12:40,873
Come on, get off.
Don't get on there.

276
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,438
Come on.

277
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,399
You're supposed to--

278
00:12:45,694 --> 00:12:47,217
Pride! Pride!

279
00:12:47,242 --> 00:12:48,670
They're supposed to be on this.

280
00:12:48,695 --> 00:12:50,184
They're not on the right side.

281
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:52,020
They can do it.

282
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:54,401
Let's see it. Pride!

283
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,037
Pride! Pride!

284
00:13:26,778 --> 00:13:28,778
Stop the ball.
Stop the ball!

285
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:30,916
Stop the ball.

286
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:35,302
Put your hands up.

287
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:45,540
No more, ladies, no more.

288
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:48,028
We're dying on the vine.

289
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:50,131
Come on, now.

290
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:52,697
Yeah!

291
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:54,364
Coach, I'm trying.

292
00:13:54,403 --> 00:13:56,686
Hey, you're doing good.

293
00:13:56,988 --> 00:13:59,808
Last year, they scored 90 on us.

294
00:14:14,763 --> 00:14:16,437
Two minutes.

295
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:18,025
Gather around.
Let's go.

296
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,064
Get on out here.

297
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:20,742
Listen, I wanna tell you something.

298
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,179
Next--

299
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,860
We, we got to work harder.

300
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:43,828
We just have to work harder.

301
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:45,400
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Yeah, but...

302
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:46,883
- Jean has nothing to do with this.
- I don't care.

303
00:14:46,908 --> 00:14:48,688
I did not bring my daughter out here...

304
00:14:48,713 --> 00:14:51,649
to sit like a nun on a log
on that bench.

305
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:53,281
- Hugh, that's not why he works.
- Uh, John, look, look.

306
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:55,321
- You know, it ain't easy.
- Just take it back a notch.

307
00:14:55,346 --> 00:14:56,763
Good, you're here.

308
00:14:56,805 --> 00:14:58,195
Why not tell him yourself?

309
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,305
I would. You--
Mother, get in the car.

310
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,580
- Tell me what?
- You,

311
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,920
you can't coach worth a damn.

312
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,251
- Hold on, John.
- That's what.

313
00:15:05,276 --> 00:15:07,805
- Slow down.
- Whatever that offense was.

314
00:15:07,877 --> 00:15:10,672
Our daughter, Portia, is a scorer.

315
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:13,015
He's used to her being
a shooter since junior high.

316
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,467
Well, that's not our system here.

317
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:15,898
Yeah, I'm gonna tell you one thing.

318
00:15:15,923 --> 00:15:18,136
Ray Burnsides was right about you.

319
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,548
These are small town girls.

320
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:22,143
This is not some big-time
college program.

321
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:23,549
It was just her first game.

322
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:25,304
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
Know what?

323
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:26,924
It was her last.

324
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:28,460
Portia, get in the car.

325
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:30,349
- Come on. Come on.
- John.

326
00:15:30,377 --> 00:15:31,826
I don't want to hear about it, Hugh.

327
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:34,256
- I don't want to hear it.
- John, look.

328
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:37,885
<i>♪ Born to lose ♪</i>

329
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:44,494
<i>♪ I've lived my life in vain ♪</i>

330
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:48,117

<i>♪ I've always been so blue ♪</i>

334
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:03,241
Take the ball.

335
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:07,683
- <i>♪ Born to lose ♪</i>
- Frances.

336
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,731
<i>♪ And now I'm losing you ♪</i>

337
00:16:09,756 --> 00:16:11,950
- At least, they try real hard.
- Come on, girls.

338
00:16:11,984 --> 00:16:13,631
- Come on, girls.
- Too cautious.

339
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:16,116
They're tentative.
They're thinking too much.

340
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,705
They're worried about fouling out.

341
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,428
They should just play.

342
00:16:20,453 --> 00:16:21,522
Keep moving.

343
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,605
Well, they're doing
what the coach told them.

344
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,511
- Come on, Ginger!
- <i>♪ Born to lose ♪</i>

345
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:33,225
<i>♪ And now I'm losing you ♪</i>

346
00:16:39,363 --> 00:16:41,593
Jean, please,
don't tell me how to coach.

347
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:43,138
- I'm not telling you how to coach.
- Come on.

348
00:16:43,163 --> 00:16:45,267
- I'm just asking you to listen.
- I just shouldn't have to take the job.

349
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,310
That's the problem.

350
00:16:50,057 --> 00:16:52,403
The girls are taking you
too literally.

351
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,885
Please.

352
00:16:54,504 --> 00:16:56,482
You say: "Don't foul",

353
00:16:56,545 --> 00:16:59,536
and what they hear is
"don't foul ever".

354
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,035
Even if it means
conceding a basket.

355
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,088
You show them a play,

356
00:17:04,154 --> 00:17:06,150
pattern's got lots of variations,

357
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:08,634
but all they remember is
the diagram you drew.

358
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:11,797
And run it every time,
automatically.

359
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,142
Like doing a box step
they learned in the dance class,

360
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,546
instead of,

361
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:17,665
you know,

362
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:19,465
rocking and rolling with it.

363
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,133
Rocking and rolling.

364
00:17:21,158 --> 00:17:23,995
Heck, everybody can coach
better than I can.

365
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:25,183
Fine.

366
00:17:25,214 --> 00:17:26,972
Think, Chubby Checkers are available?

367
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,927
We could hire them.

368
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,847
Well, thank goodness, at least.

369
00:17:30,872 --> 00:17:34,177
I thought you lost
your sense of humor completely.

370
00:17:38,237 --> 00:17:39,839
Clay.

371
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:43,517
Honey.

372
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,279
Come on.

373
00:17:48,223 --> 00:17:49,912
Pull over.

374
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,402
Come on, pull over.

375
00:18:02,176 --> 00:18:04,491
It's not about coaching.

376
00:18:04,537 --> 00:18:07,663
It's about how boys
and girls are different.

377
00:18:07,758 --> 00:18:09,936
Especially, country girls.

378
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:11,885
I should know.

379
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:16,118
We're like our mamas.

380
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:18,340
Aiming to please.

381
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,094
You?

382
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,578
Clay.

383
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:26,335
Clay, honey, boys can do
what they want and always could.

384
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,320
You have that freedom.

385
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:30,977
- Well.
- But not girls here.

386
00:18:31,002 --> 00:18:33,156
Unless, you're given.

387
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:39,567
Their mamas wash the clothes...

388
00:18:39,592 --> 00:18:41,157
and cook and help in the fields...

389
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:42,798
and sew and raise the kids...

390
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:44,572
and never complain.

391
00:18:44,636 --> 00:18:46,087
They're tough.

392
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,763
Clay, and their daughters are tough.

393
00:18:47,788 --> 00:18:48,858
They won't break.

394
00:18:48,883 --> 00:18:51,542
I, I practice them just
as hard as I practice boys.

395
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:53,224
Let them play...

396
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:56,014
by the same rules as the boys.

397
00:18:56,325 --> 00:18:59,328
Give them permission
to be who they are.

398
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,884
Think for themselves.

399
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:04,215
Some girl bumps 'em,

400
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:07,174
let them bump 'em right back.

401
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,190
Hard.

402
00:19:10,986 --> 00:19:13,306
Go head.
Press, press Ruth, Susan.

403
00:19:13,338 --> 00:19:14,940
Come on.
Push it in. Push it in.

404
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:17,326
Wait, whoa, whoa.
What, what are you doing?

405
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:18,770
You said to pass it to Liz.

406
00:19:18,795 --> 00:19:20,921
Not if she's not open.
I'm guarding her now.

407
00:19:20,946 --> 00:19:22,034
But, you said to--

408
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:24,498
Well, you don't just pass because...

409
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:25,841
I said so.

410
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,936
Girls, sit down.

411
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:30,539
What I'm trying to--

412
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:34,682
Uh.

413
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:37,249
Okay. Alright now.

414
00:19:37,925 --> 00:19:39,744
Alright. Uh...

415
00:19:39,773 --> 00:19:41,367
Look.

416
00:19:41,637 --> 00:19:44,520
Who here likes dancing?

417
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:48,324
- You mean, like--
- Yeah.

418
00:19:48,363 --> 00:19:51,322
Yeah, like dance dancing,
you know, um...

419
00:19:51,618 --> 00:19:53,291
Elvis?

420
00:19:53,534 --> 00:19:56,377
It's the stroll, you know?

421
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,653
Yeah.

422
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,653
Yeah. Who likes to dance?

423
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:07,371
Okay, we need a little
more dancing on this court.

424
00:20:07,396 --> 00:20:09,339
Or a little more Rock-N-Roll, okay?

425
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:11,129
Let's try some out, okay?

426
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:13,097
Think things like
you're dancing out there,

427
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:15,613
not like you're doing some box step.

428
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:16,853
Alright, come on.

429
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:18,885
Come on, work it in there.
Go ahead, run it in there.

430
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,643
Come on, Liz,
move off that screen.

431
00:20:20,668 --> 00:20:22,193
Come on, now.
Come on. That's it.

432
00:20:22,218 --> 00:20:24,054
Good pass. Good pass.

433
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:26,251
Hey.

434
00:20:26,863 --> 00:20:28,279
That was, uh...

435
00:20:28,334 --> 00:20:31,168
cute what you was doing that, uh...

436
00:20:31,479 --> 00:20:33,833
- whatever it was.
- Whatever that was.

437
00:20:33,886 --> 00:20:35,977
Anyways, Clay, uh...

438
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:38,616
Bannister is not coming back.

439
00:20:38,688 --> 00:20:39,948
I spoke to his wife.

440
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,508
They're moving.

441
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:43,667
He needs better hospitals.

442
00:20:43,855 --> 00:20:45,347
Don't tell me that.

443
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:47,572
Now look, Clay.
I, I know you're disappointed.

444
00:20:47,597 --> 00:20:48,821
Now, just, just listen to me.

445
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:49,988
- Hear me out.
- Oh, Hugh.

446
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:51,892
I think, we have
another option here.

447
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,002
Just, look,

448
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:55,391
let me tell you about the JV's.

449
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,831
Well, not again.

450
00:20:56,862 --> 00:20:58,459
At least, watch one game.

451
00:20:58,484 --> 00:20:59,641
For what?

452
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:02,039
Here, freshmen are eligible
for the district tournament,

453
00:21:02,064 --> 00:21:03,504
once their season ends.

454
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:06,016
That's 10 days before the Varsity's does.

455
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,512
So, you could put up to 4 of
the best players on your squad.

456
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:09,842
Kids in junior high?

457
00:21:09,873 --> 00:21:11,301
Clay, I'm telling you.

458
00:21:11,326 --> 00:21:13,344
These gals are super.

459
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:15,026
Well, with them on your team next year--

460
00:21:15,051 --> 00:21:16,160
Next year?

461
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:18,241
It's for your next coach,
and it won't be me.

462
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:19,869
Hush!

463
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,316
Comes September,

464
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:23,843
I'm coaching boys,
we both know our service.

465
00:21:24,503 --> 00:21:27,288
Not as the losing girls coach,
you won't.

466
00:21:27,606 --> 00:21:29,139
Maybe, assistant again.

467
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,990
But, no way.

468
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,736
Boys Head Coach?

469
00:21:34,582 --> 00:21:36,649
At least, not from here.

470
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:53,020
Hyah!

471
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,904
What's the problem there?

472
00:21:59,202 --> 00:22:01,007
Mr. Brawley.

473
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,736
Need a hand?

474
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:10,989
What couldn't wait until Monday?

475
00:22:13,154 --> 00:22:15,864
My team, sir, the girls.

476
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,163
There's only so much
we can accomplish.

477
00:22:19,411 --> 00:22:21,935
Practice in an hour
before lunch. We...

478
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:23,911
we need a better time.

479
00:22:24,171 --> 00:22:27,055
And we need new balls
and shoes, sir.

480
00:22:27,116 --> 00:22:28,983
Maybe, new uniforms, and...

481
00:22:29,025 --> 00:22:31,753
and warmups, not those
old castoffs from the boys.

482
00:22:31,778 --> 00:22:33,547
Just for the girls...

483
00:22:33,673 --> 00:22:35,524
to be successful.

484
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,547
To have...

485
00:22:38,146 --> 00:22:40,599
to have pride in themselves.

486
00:22:45,184 --> 00:22:47,010
Where'd you say you're from again?

487
00:22:47,035 --> 00:22:48,099
Fort Gibson.

488
00:22:48,124 --> 00:22:50,590
It's, it's just outside Muskogee.

489
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:53,766
And then, the Marines,
and then, Norman.

490
00:22:55,982 --> 00:22:57,077
But,

491
00:22:57,236 --> 00:22:58,695
not from here.

492
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:00,180
No, sir.

493
00:23:00,578 --> 00:23:02,172
Not here.

494
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:04,891
You see all this here?

495
00:23:04,954 --> 00:23:07,178
- Yes, sir.
- Been in my family...

496
00:23:07,312 --> 00:23:09,497
for six generations.

497
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,735
The town too.

498
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,523
Lived on it, died on it.

499
00:23:15,566 --> 00:23:17,539
So, don't try and tell me
how it works.

500
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:19,560
I'm sorry. I'm not
trying to do that, sir.

501
00:23:19,585 --> 00:23:21,808
What I'm, what I'm all,
all I'm asking--

502
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,909
You've never laid the first
brick to mortar here, boy.

503
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,686
You're as transient as the wind.

504
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:29,497
We're talking about
the girls, sir, not me.

505
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:32,365
Well, their mamas and their daddies...

506
00:23:32,523 --> 00:23:34,188
of these girls,

507
00:23:34,227 --> 00:23:36,970
they sure as hell know
there's a drought going on here.

508
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:39,437
I can't understand why you don't.

509
00:23:39,495 --> 00:23:40,781
I know there's a drought, sir.

510
00:23:40,813 --> 00:23:42,465
Well then, who's supposed
to pay for it all?

511
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,385
Well.

512
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,742
I mean, you want to tell me that?

513
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:45,788
What should we do?

514
00:23:45,813 --> 00:23:46,937
- I mean, the only solution...
- I...

515
00:23:46,962 --> 00:23:48,093
- I can come up with is...
- Somebody's...

516
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,365
- let's just stop buying the books,
- Somebody's...

517
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,188
- let's stop buying the light bulbs.
- buying the boys the new gears...

518
00:23:51,213 --> 00:23:52,874
and, and, and the, and the...

519
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:55,924
and, and, and
hot meals after games.

520
00:23:55,949 --> 00:23:57,570
- The boys,
- And the slick new poster...

521
00:23:57,595 --> 00:23:59,316
- the boys win.
- I saw down on Main street.

522
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:01,593
- The boys make money.
- Yes. Yes, sir.

523
00:24:01,632 --> 00:24:03,082
Okay?

524
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:06,752
I'm just asking you
to give the girls a chance.

525
00:24:06,783 --> 00:24:08,378
That's it, sir.

526
00:24:08,742 --> 00:24:10,406
Well, I'll tell you what?

527
00:24:10,445 --> 00:24:12,459
When you and your girls...

528
00:24:12,515 --> 00:24:14,494
start making money,

529
00:24:14,905 --> 00:24:16,597
maybe.

530
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:23,036
We'll see.

531
00:24:28,347 --> 00:24:29,902
Come on.

532
00:24:30,084 --> 00:24:32,144
Post up! Post up!

533
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:34,072
- Come on.
- Look at that.

534
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,835
- Ref, you got to call it.
- Come on!

535
00:24:40,474 --> 00:24:42,345
You're all bunch of losers.

536
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,651
That's all you'll ever be, is losers!

537
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:46,207
Well, she's clear enough.

538
00:24:46,232 --> 00:24:47,269
Let's go!

539
00:24:47,294 --> 00:24:49,103
Hey, 24, nice legs!

540
00:24:49,128 --> 00:24:50,400
That's enough out of you.

541
00:24:50,425 --> 00:24:52,213
- What you're gonna about it?
- I'll sit you down and shut you up, boy.

542
00:24:52,238 --> 00:24:53,693
- That's what I'm gonna do now.
- You want to take this outside?

543
00:24:53,718 --> 00:24:54,730
- I'll take you anywhere you want.
- Frances.

544
00:24:54,755 --> 00:24:55,767
Let's go if you want some.

545
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:57,200
- Come on.
- Frances!

546
00:24:57,225 --> 00:24:59,000
- Okay.
- Ginger, focus out there.

547
00:24:59,025 --> 00:25:00,048
- Be patient.
- Come on.

548
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,861
- Okay, make it happen.
- Playing hard.

549
00:25:01,886 --> 00:25:03,015
They just not get the call.

550
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,290
Why don't you run back
to your girlfriend?

551
00:25:05,635 --> 00:25:07,111
Oh, my gosh!

552
00:25:08,942 --> 00:25:11,066
Oh-oh-oh-oh!

553
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:16,535
Watch inside!

554
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,785
Oh, come on now.

555
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:20,492
That was a hacking.
You got to call one foul on them.

556
00:25:20,517 --> 00:25:21,682
You shut your mouth.

557
00:25:21,712 --> 00:25:22,945
Ref.

558
00:25:23,413 --> 00:25:24,675
Clay.

559
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:27,507
It's always like this here.

560
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:31,828
Look! Sadie, help out, Sadie.

561
00:25:31,853 --> 00:25:33,399
Help out!

562
00:25:33,493 --> 00:25:35,313
- Go. Go!
- There you go!

563
00:25:35,461 --> 00:25:36,828
Time.

564
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:39,074
Time out! Time out!

565
00:25:39,115 --> 00:25:41,163
Middleton's time out.

566
00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:45,919
Come on, now. Come on,
you're not dancing out there.

567
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:48,020
Find the open man and
run him ragged with motion.

568
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:50,339
Coach, we tried, but
they keep on pushing and...

569
00:25:50,364 --> 00:25:51,905
shoving every chance they get.

570
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,016
- There's nothing we can do.
- Shoved me in the back.

571
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:55,605
Alright, alright, alright, alright.

572
00:25:55,645 --> 00:25:57,202
Alright, enough of this.

573
00:25:57,233 --> 00:25:58,380
Listen up.

574
00:25:58,405 --> 00:25:59,488
Let's see how they like it.

575
00:25:59,513 --> 00:26:01,340
Ginger, move the ball
over to the strong side.

576
00:26:01,365 --> 00:26:03,035
And Sadie,
with one eye on the ref,

577
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,833
shove off your man
just like they do.

578
00:26:04,858 --> 00:26:07,389
Ruth, would you be so kind
as to set her a pick?

579
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,147
Girls, you now have the permission.

580
00:26:09,172 --> 00:26:10,407
Whatever they dish out,

581
00:26:10,432 --> 00:26:12,092
you give it back twice as hard.

582
00:26:12,117 --> 00:26:13,310
Twice as hard!

583
00:26:13,335 --> 00:26:15,397
- One, two, three. Pride!
- Pride!

584
00:26:18,324 --> 00:26:19,671
Move the ball!
That's it.

585
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:22,031
Okay, make it happen.

586
00:26:22,065 --> 00:26:24,293
Come on, come on.
Make it happen.

587
00:26:27,464 --> 00:26:30,226
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah, that's it.

588
00:26:31,031 --> 00:26:33,043
Move back, move back.

589
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,885
Frances, she can't go to her left.

590
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:37,602
Over play the right hand.
Over play the right hand!

591
00:26:39,477 --> 00:26:41,230
Oh! Hey!

592
00:26:41,276 --> 00:26:43,094
Come on!

593
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,398
Oh! What?

594
00:26:53,438 --> 00:26:54,798
A fight.

595
00:26:54,854 --> 00:26:56,295
Clear out.

596
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:58,188
Ref, this side fouls.

597
00:26:58,244 --> 00:26:59,672
Come on, clear out.

598
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:01,934
Come on, come on now.

599
00:27:01,993 --> 00:27:04,647
Don't you ever talk to me like that.

600
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,826
Hold on, hold on!

601
00:27:15,878 --> 00:27:16,905
Alright.

602
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:18,453
Alright, alright

603
00:27:24,562 --> 00:27:26,030
Personal foul!

604
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:27,797
2-4, red!

605
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:29,689
Ref, I think that girl's second foul.

606
00:27:29,721 --> 00:27:32,001
- She's struck my girl!
- Go away, and fall out.

607
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,700
What kind of coaching
you do with your girls there?

608
00:27:33,725 --> 00:27:35,970
It ain't my fault,
they've never played.

609
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:37,957
You alright?

610
00:27:37,982 --> 00:27:39,815
- Coach, I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

611
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,265
- They deserved it.
- Are you okay?

612
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,830
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- You alright?

613
00:27:42,855 --> 00:27:43,885
You alright?

614
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:45,986
- You alright?
- Coach, that was fun.

615
00:27:46,018 --> 00:27:47,473
Well, that's I call:

616
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:49,451
Rocking and Rolling with it.

617
00:27:49,547 --> 00:27:51,882
- Alright, this is it.
- That was fun.

618
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:53,574
Alright, come on now.

619
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,373
I can't wait for the next dance.

620
00:27:58,045 --> 00:27:59,857
Frances Bonner!

621
00:28:00,135 --> 00:28:01,927
Frances Bonner.

622
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:05,461
We always said, your natural
inclination was sinful.

623
00:28:05,492 --> 00:28:07,930
And that Price boy being here
tonight is the proof of it.

624
00:28:07,955 --> 00:28:09,607
- No, Daddy, you are not--
- That...

625
00:28:09,632 --> 00:28:11,843
vulgar half-naked display.

626
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:13,252
We never should have allowed it.

627
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:14,704
- Preacher Bonner.
- Get in the truck.

628
00:28:14,729 --> 00:28:16,316
- Just wait.
- Get in the truck now.

629
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:17,354
- Hold on, sir.
- Coach.

630
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:18,611
- Hold on.
- You're abetting this.

631
00:28:18,636 --> 00:28:19,893
- You're abetting this!
- Sir.

632
00:28:19,918 --> 00:28:21,624
- It was you.
- Mr. Bonner.

633
00:28:21,656 --> 00:28:22,975
Like all these girls,

634
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,788
Frances is and has always been...

635
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,536
a fine and respectable young lady.

636
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:28,030
You get on that bus,

637
00:28:28,062 --> 00:28:30,229
- don't bother coming home.
- Mama.

638
00:28:30,254 --> 00:28:32,225
- Mama, please!
- Frances, it's alright.

639
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,217
- I'll drag you by the hair if I have to!
- Hold on now, sir.

640
00:28:35,242 --> 00:28:38,289
- She's still my legal responsibility.
- No more, she's not.

641
00:28:38,314 --> 00:28:40,000
- Hey, hey, hey, you can't do this.
- What?

642
00:28:40,025 --> 00:28:41,391
- Please, let me go!
- You're coming now.

643
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:43,141
No, let me go!

644
00:28:43,166 --> 00:28:44,275
Father, be reasonable.

645
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,594
- Coach.
- Now!

646
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:46,697
Open that door!

647
00:28:46,729 --> 00:28:49,001
- Father, please, I don't want to get in!
- Get in!

648
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:50,735
- Mama. Mama.
- Get in.

649
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,829
Shut your mouth and
get in the truck, Frances.

650
00:28:52,854 --> 00:28:55,092
Never, never again.

651
00:29:03,536 --> 00:29:09,730
Amen.

652
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,552
Pride.

653
00:29:25,106 --> 00:29:29,401
King Solomon in Proverbs teaches us:

654
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:34,762
"In the mouth of the foolish
is a rod of pride."

655
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:37,379
Remember, friends.

656
00:29:37,673 --> 00:29:42,079
Pride goeth before destruction,

657
00:29:42,104 --> 00:29:46,317
and cometh crashing before the fall.

658
00:29:46,724 --> 00:29:51,330
Hard times are the Lord's
test of character.

659
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,684
Coach!
Mr. Driscoll!

660
00:29:56,709 --> 00:29:58,593
I want you to meet
Frank and Dorothy Thompson.

661
00:29:58,618 --> 00:29:59,937
- Fans of yours.
- Howdy.

662
00:29:59,962 --> 00:30:03,229
Hey, their daughter, Pat,
is star of the JV team.

663
00:30:03,332 --> 00:30:06,544
Frank and me, we'd like to invite
you and Mrs. Driscoll for supper.

664
00:30:06,569 --> 00:30:08,998
- Maybe, come see the Little Twisters?
- That's what they call them.

665
00:30:09,023 --> 00:30:10,508
Our girls are 10 and 0.

666
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:12,502
Eligible for the district
tournament in a month.

667
00:30:12,527 --> 00:30:13,687
It's terrific.

668
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:15,501
Those girls care?

669
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,837
Frank, how'd the well do?

670
00:30:17,862 --> 00:30:18,884
It did.

671
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:20,723
- For water drips.
- Well, that's good.

672
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:22,185
You get any problems, Frank,

673
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,753
you call Brandon down at the bank.

674
00:30:23,777 --> 00:30:25,342
You got his number.

675
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,367
You know one thing,
we all better remember,

676
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,193
we are in this together.

677
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:31,404
We got to stick together.

678
00:30:31,724 --> 00:30:33,338
Fair enough?

679
00:30:34,117 --> 00:30:36,922
You all have a real nice Sunday now.

680
00:30:42,232 --> 00:30:43,781
That son-of-a-bitch.

681
00:30:43,813 --> 00:30:46,636
- Anyhow, Coach, the Twisters--
- Whatever. Ma'am.

682
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:48,453
Clay?

683
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:55,429
Goodness! He's--

684
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,634
I'm sorry.

685
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:00,562
Don't you apologize.

686
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:02,039
It's them that should.

687
00:31:02,073 --> 00:31:04,242
Mr. Brawley, the Pastor?

688
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:08,140
Frances Bonner ran off
and married the Price boy.

689
00:31:08,256 --> 00:31:10,044
And they're blaming your husband.

690
00:31:10,091 --> 00:31:12,884
Now the kids,
they're somewhere penniless.

691
00:31:16,734 --> 00:31:18,985
And I hear, she's pregnant.

692
00:31:22,874 --> 00:31:24,017
Oh, don't.

693
00:31:24,042 --> 00:31:26,601
Don't blame yourself.

694
00:31:26,697 --> 00:31:30,064
- This place, this place--
- It's not this place.

695
00:31:30,103 --> 00:31:31,902
It's a few...

696
00:31:32,328 --> 00:31:34,311
stupid people.

697
00:31:36,736 --> 00:31:38,329
Hell with them.

698
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:41,795
I'll let the JVs play.

699
00:31:41,857 --> 00:31:44,476
- Melva Johnson.
- Melva Johnson.

700
00:31:45,074 --> 00:31:46,493
- Candy Brown.
- Candy Brown.

701
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:47,972
Mr. Brown, how are you, sir?

702
00:31:47,997 --> 00:31:49,989
- Dorothy Crossett.
- Dorothy Crossett.

703
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,636
I need few more players.

704
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:54,012
Alright. I think we, uh--

705
00:31:54,044 --> 00:31:55,685
- Pat Thompson.
- How are you all doing?

706
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,973
- Pat Thompson.
- She's amazing.

707
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,082
So, teamwork out there.

708
00:32:01,114 --> 00:32:03,324
Use your heads and grit.

709
00:32:03,411 --> 00:32:04,696
Ball movement.

710
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:06,776
- Constant motion away from the ball.
- Hey, Coach?

711
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:08,483
If we win tonight, will you stay?

712
00:32:08,515 --> 00:32:09,951
Please, don't go, Coach.

713
00:32:09,983 --> 00:32:11,978
- Say, you won't go.
- Coach, you have to stay.

714
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,717
Please, stay.

715
00:32:16,046 --> 00:32:17,414
Coach.

716
00:32:17,678 --> 00:32:20,048
We're gonna be better next year.

717
00:32:21,676 --> 00:32:23,257
Stay back.

718
00:32:25,815 --> 00:32:27,206
It's okay, it's okay.

719
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,451
It's alright. It's alright.

720
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,141
Time out. Time out!

721
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:07,727
Time out!

722
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:09,101
Let's go, get in.

723
00:33:09,126 --> 00:33:11,183
Come on, now. Hustle.

724
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:17,776
Alright. You four out, you stay in.

725
00:33:17,801 --> 00:33:19,377
Little Twisters,
I'm gonna put you in.

726
00:33:19,402 --> 00:33:21,291
- You know my offense?
- Yes, sir.

727
00:33:21,323 --> 00:33:23,664
Move the ball around,
see if you can unclog that middle.

728
00:33:23,689 --> 00:33:24,713
Bring it in.

729
00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:27,190
- One, two, three, pride!
- Pride!

730
00:33:31,598 --> 00:33:33,073
Yeah!

731
00:33:33,113 --> 00:33:35,285
Yeah. Yeah!

732
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,527
Saint Margaret is one
of the best in the county.

733
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,083
You played tough.

734
00:34:16,115 --> 00:34:17,636
Coach.

735
00:34:17,983 --> 00:34:20,089
Look, I'm gone.

736
00:34:20,137 --> 00:34:22,043
I'm senior.

737
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:25,536
But, these girls,

738
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:27,966
if you quit now,

739
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:30,620
it's just gonna go back
to the way it was.

740
00:34:30,893 --> 00:34:32,898
They need you.

741
00:34:38,098 --> 00:34:40,485
You'd be proud of yourselves.

742
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,646
I am.

743
00:34:45,597 --> 00:34:47,926
It was a good season.

744
00:34:57,636 --> 00:35:00,124
Here's how it works
since they let me.

745
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:02,573
Next two years, three tops,

746
00:35:02,604 --> 00:35:04,225
- you assist with Joe Harold.
- No.

747
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,862
- Joe--
- I know.

748
00:35:06,102 --> 00:35:07,499
But once he retires,

749
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:09,685
we'll try to make you
the boys head coach.

750
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:12,837
The best I can do,
you coming off a losing season.

751
00:35:14,205 --> 00:35:16,078
How's Jean with all this?

752
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:18,825
It's nearly 700 less.

753
00:35:18,934 --> 00:35:21,699
All we offer is a one-bedroom.

754
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,770
She's fine with it, Joe.

755
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:28,021
Well, can't promise anything, but...

756
00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:29,516
maybe, secretarial.

757
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:31,804
Can't guarantee that.

758
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:39,273
Okay.

759
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:55,092
- It's that you, Joe?
- No, no, sir.

760
00:35:55,124 --> 00:35:57,195
It's Johnny Price.

761
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,142
Frances Bonner's husband.

762
00:35:59,193 --> 00:36:01,041
Johnny Price?

763
00:36:01,178 --> 00:36:02,889
Did I hear you're in Texas?

764
00:36:02,914 --> 00:36:04,320
No, sir, we...

765
00:36:04,352 --> 00:36:05,882
we live here now,
have been.

766
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:07,529
Place out near Dale High.

767
00:36:07,563 --> 00:36:10,217
And Frances wanted me to find you.

768
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,550
Me?

769
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,909
- Why is that?
- Well.

770
00:36:14,042 --> 00:36:16,029
Right now, she's,
she's having a baby, sir.

771
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:17,764
And, uh...

772
00:36:18,993 --> 00:36:20,742
we don't really have much.

773
00:36:20,767 --> 00:36:22,215
And...

774
00:36:23,064 --> 00:36:24,226
I'm no use.

775
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:25,620
So...

776
00:36:27,283 --> 00:36:29,414
she said to call you.

777
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,297
Frances?

778
00:36:42,321 --> 00:36:43,646
See?

779
00:36:43,938 --> 00:36:45,641
I got him.

780
00:36:45,886 --> 00:36:47,326
Frances?

781
00:36:47,377 --> 00:36:48,675
Coach.

782
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,706
I'm a month early.

783
00:36:50,737 --> 00:36:52,032
It hurt.

784
00:36:52,065 --> 00:36:53,681
Oh, God!

785
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:55,697
Oh.

786
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,942
Okay.

787
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:59,121
Alright. It's alright.

788
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:04,720
Johnny, I need you to go
get my wife at the county agents,

789
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,712
and tell her to bring
the doctor, okay?

790
00:37:06,737 --> 00:37:08,337
But, sir, we can't pay. We,

791
00:37:08,362 --> 00:37:09,782
- we don't have any money.
- Go on, now. Get!

792
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:11,210
- Johnny, go.
- Go on, now.

793
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:12,396
Oh-oh.

794
00:37:12,428 --> 00:37:14,507
God! Oh, God!

795
00:37:17,384 --> 00:37:18,395
Okay.

796
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,854
Okay. Alright.

797
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:21,102
I'm scared. It hurts.

798
00:37:21,127 --> 00:37:22,162
Come on, now.

799
00:37:22,187 --> 00:37:23,965
That's a contraction, alright?

800
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,900
- It's gonna go away in a second.
- Okay.

801
00:37:25,925 --> 00:37:27,892
So, you're gonna be just fine, darling.

802
00:37:27,917 --> 00:37:29,467
You're gonna be just fine.

803
00:37:29,492 --> 00:37:31,777
I need you to do
something for me, Frances.

804
00:37:31,824 --> 00:37:33,496
I need you to time...

805
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:35,694
- between when these happen, alright?
- Alright.

806
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,824
I gotta go outside
and get some kindling.

807
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,049
Hold on.
I'll be right back.

808
00:37:39,078 --> 00:37:41,142
- Hold on.
- Coach?

809
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:45,538
I need it come.

810
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,334
- You'll be just fine, darling.
- Okay.

811
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:49,893
Okay.

812
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:14,252
You take that real good.

813
00:38:16,688 --> 00:38:19,010
Would have done better
with you, though.

814
00:38:21,484 --> 00:38:22,651
Can I...

815
00:38:22,683 --> 00:38:24,714
can I ask you something?

816
00:38:25,514 --> 00:38:27,603
Something personal?

817
00:38:28,928 --> 00:38:30,287
Sure.

818
00:38:33,499 --> 00:38:36,118
How come you don't have kids?

819
00:38:37,477 --> 00:38:38,822
I mean,

820
00:38:38,914 --> 00:38:41,442
people say stuff, but...

821
00:38:42,547 --> 00:38:45,050
you'll be such a good daddy.

822
00:38:46,517 --> 00:38:49,018
You know, I want to real bad.

823
00:38:49,956 --> 00:38:51,840
But, Jean and I...

824
00:38:57,892 --> 00:39:00,014
I got something wrong.

825
00:39:02,183 --> 00:39:03,681
I did all these tests.

826
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,680
Doctor says, I can't.

827
00:39:14,135 --> 00:39:16,232
Jean wants to adopt.

828
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:19,121
Don't you?

829
00:39:20,894 --> 00:39:22,045
Oh.

830
00:39:22,434 --> 00:39:25,418
Ow, ow, ow!

831
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:27,358
Ow!

832
00:39:50,464 --> 00:39:52,810
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

833
00:39:52,853 --> 00:39:55,096
They're both fine.
They're asleep.

834
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,729
You might wanna
check on Frances.

835
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:03,581
He's like a little bird.

836
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,799
Choo-choo!
Hey, Mrs. Grove.

837
00:40:16,851 --> 00:40:18,745
- How is she?
- She's just fine.

838
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,167
Good.

839
00:40:20,192 --> 00:40:24,274
I brought a corn casserole,
and she's got some baby clothes.

840
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,649
Hey, Frances.

841
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:27,829
- Hi.
- Let me see him.

842
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,773
You know,

843
00:40:31,798 --> 00:40:34,920
Mama was about your age
when she had Raymond Jr.

844
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:36,476
Ain't that right, Mama?

845
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:37,928
You 17?

846
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,220
Yes, ma'am.

847
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:40,817
Mm-hm. Yeah.

848
00:40:41,476 --> 00:40:43,725
Welcome to the club.

849
00:40:46,295 --> 00:40:49,168
Why don't you and Clay
go on home?

850
00:40:49,292 --> 00:40:51,372
He looks worn out.

851
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:54,825
Frances.

852
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,013
Alright.

853
00:40:56,052 --> 00:40:57,243
I'm, uh...

854
00:40:57,268 --> 00:41:00,188
I'm gonna leave you with far more
responsible company than me now.

855
00:41:00,213 --> 00:41:01,638
- I'm gonna get on home.
- Ask, ask him.

856
00:41:01,663 --> 00:41:02,858
Uh...

857
00:41:03,036 --> 00:41:06,187
Well, we, we were
just wondering if...

858
00:41:07,122 --> 00:41:10,800
well, if it would be alright
if we named him after you.

859
00:41:11,088 --> 00:41:13,491
Clayton as his middle name.

860
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,550
That'd be alright.
Yeah, I guess.

861
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,208
Thank you.

862
00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:27,208
Now, you go on.
Let her get some sleep, okay?

863
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:28,339
- Alright.
- Alright?

864
00:41:28,364 --> 00:41:30,000
- Go on.
- Okay.

865
00:41:30,302 --> 00:41:31,542
Well, we-- Okay.

866
00:41:31,567 --> 00:41:33,313
You did good, Coach.

867
00:41:33,474 --> 00:41:35,419
Okay, okay.

868
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,123
Okay, yeah, okay.

869
00:41:37,148 --> 00:41:38,709
Okay, okay.

870
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:40,091
Okay.

871
00:41:40,116 --> 00:41:41,972
God bless.

872
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:46,441
<i>But, even if we pass this test,</i>

873
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:49,032
<i>battle will not be over.</i>

874
00:41:49,526 --> 00:41:52,486
<i>- What happens--</i>
- Oh, man.

875
00:41:52,515 --> 00:41:54,645
I shouldn't say what
it looks like outside.

876
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,288
Might jinx it.

877
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:59,467
Mm, something smells good.
What've we gotten?

878
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:01,553
The ham.

879
00:42:01,589 --> 00:42:03,200
- Get on out.
- What?

880
00:42:03,225 --> 00:42:05,197
From the Yorks.

881
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:08,801
Monday, it was...

882
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:11,761
strawberries and catfish
from the Thompsons.

883
00:42:11,803 --> 00:42:13,177
You're being bribed.

884
00:42:13,202 --> 00:42:15,240
What's, what's this.

885
00:42:16,123 --> 00:42:17,462
Uh, it's...

886
00:42:17,495 --> 00:42:20,085
from Joe Brody, I'm guessing.

887
00:42:30,627 --> 00:42:31,849
What does it say?

888
00:42:31,874 --> 00:42:33,946
Job is mine if I want it.

889
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:35,494
Money is what I told you.

890
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:38,598
Assistant two years
instead of three, Joe hopes.

891
00:42:39,443 --> 00:42:42,049
- And?
- Come now, he says.

892
00:42:42,704 --> 00:42:44,640
Holy cow!

893
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:47,188
Clay.

894
00:42:49,381 --> 00:42:51,400
Oh, my God!

895
00:42:51,425 --> 00:42:53,010
Would you look at that?

896
00:42:53,035 --> 00:42:54,142
Whoa!

897
00:42:54,167 --> 00:42:55,906
Oh, jeez!

898
00:42:55,931 --> 00:42:57,031
More!

899
00:42:57,056 --> 00:42:59,376
- Woo hoo!
- Woo!

900
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,900
- Oh!
- Let it rain, please!

901
00:43:02,963 --> 00:43:05,228
- Hey!
- Woo!

902
00:43:05,259 --> 00:43:06,363
Finally!

903
00:43:06,403 --> 00:43:09,355
I hope it rained
for two weeks like this.

904
00:43:10,191 --> 00:43:12,248
Honey, what about Ada?

905
00:43:12,743 --> 00:43:14,259
This is crazy!

906
00:43:14,307 --> 00:43:15,679
Oh!

907
00:43:16,832 --> 00:43:20,419
Maybe, I'm just a girls
basketball coach after all.

908
00:43:24,016 --> 00:43:25,508
Mm.

909
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:27,471
Woo-hoo!

910
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,555
Oh, finally!

911
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,192
Woo!

912
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:52,790
Come on, let's go.

913
00:43:52,815 --> 00:43:54,140
Come on.

914
00:43:54,165 --> 00:43:55,678
Let's go!

915
00:44:05,694 --> 00:44:08,410
I'll be back in an hour, Jean.

916
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:10,147
Come on.

917
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:11,992
Oh, come on.

918
00:44:40,223 --> 00:44:41,654
Driscoll.

919
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:44,158
John Stovall.

920
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:46,250
- Portia's dad.
- I remember.

921
00:44:48,161 --> 00:44:50,066
She wants to play again.

922
00:44:50,185 --> 00:44:52,477
But, I don't want her
taken advantage of.

923
00:44:52,545 --> 00:44:54,013
- How so?
- Treated unfairly.

924
00:44:54,038 --> 00:44:56,168
- Because of last year.
- She wasn't treated unfairly.

925
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,133
Look, there's not
any reason to get all--

926
00:44:58,192 --> 00:44:59,763
You see, I'm a lawyer and I--

927
00:44:59,789 --> 00:45:01,302
Daddy.

928
00:45:05,376 --> 00:45:07,345
I apologize.

929
00:45:07,758 --> 00:45:09,314
She works hard, she plays.

930
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:10,599
Same as everyone.

931
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:12,543
That's all I care about.

932
00:45:12,956 --> 00:45:14,728
Good enough. Thank you.

933
00:45:15,021 --> 00:45:16,689
I appreciate it.

934
00:45:17,292 --> 00:45:19,110
Thanks, Daddy.

935
00:45:19,399 --> 00:45:21,710
Can I go to the team meeting?

936
00:45:21,979 --> 00:45:24,531
She heard about it
from her friends.

937
00:45:24,775 --> 00:45:26,641
This is where the team meeting is?

938
00:45:26,688 --> 00:45:28,921
Well, ask them.
They called it.

939
00:45:28,986 --> 00:45:31,608
Now, who said you could do that?

940
00:45:31,783 --> 00:45:34,862
Hello, Coach Driscoll.

941
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:37,942
The reason we did this
was to set training rules.

942
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:39,061
Training rules?

943
00:45:39,086 --> 00:45:40,363
Like boys have.

944
00:45:40,395 --> 00:45:41,492
Real teams.

945
00:45:41,518 --> 00:45:42,525
You know?

946
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:43,746
Like what we need to do,

947
00:45:43,771 --> 00:45:45,489
and, and do without
to win this year.

948
00:45:45,514 --> 00:45:48,021
Like what we eat, and what time
you want us in bed at night.

949
00:45:48,062 --> 00:45:49,067
A team curfew.

950
00:45:49,092 --> 00:45:51,221
And how many nights before
a game shouldn't we date?

951
00:45:51,261 --> 00:45:53,342
Or does it matter?

952
00:45:54,082 --> 00:45:56,590
And what about cherry cokes?

953
00:45:56,818 --> 00:45:58,709
You're, you're joking right?

954
00:45:58,749 --> 00:46:00,465
If you're gonna treat us like boys,

955
00:46:00,498 --> 00:46:02,362
we wanna prepare like boys.

956
00:46:02,396 --> 00:46:05,640
So, what we're saying is that--

957
00:46:08,415 --> 00:46:10,137
Let's go ladies.

958
00:46:10,219 --> 00:46:11,957
Keep it moving.

959
00:46:12,731 --> 00:46:14,112
Nice.

960
00:46:22,909 --> 00:46:25,062
Push that ball.
Snap it, snap it.

961
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:28,430
Let's play, baby.

962
00:46:39,632 --> 00:46:41,127
God, it'll...

963
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:42,633
it'll last maybe a week,

964
00:46:42,658 --> 00:46:44,585
but I went along with it.

965
00:46:44,628 --> 00:46:46,887
Starting in November,

966
00:46:47,592 --> 00:46:50,586
no soda pop and just
one candy bar a week.

967
00:46:50,744 --> 00:46:53,857
Bedtime, they, they voted,
would be 9:30,

968
00:46:53,882 --> 00:46:55,752
except, on Saturday night.

969
00:46:55,866 --> 00:46:58,572
I said, get serious.

970
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:00,716
Girls.

971
00:47:01,696 --> 00:47:03,290
Softie?

972
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:14,312
Clay, it's time.

973
00:47:36,335 --> 00:47:39,210
It just needs your signature.

974
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:52,042
Aren't you happy, Jean?

975
00:47:53,757 --> 00:47:56,407
You know, it's not that simple.

976
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,554
Yes.

977
00:48:00,774 --> 00:48:02,189
No.

978
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,047
Sometimes.

979
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:09,359
Honey, there is no shame.

980
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,802
None.

981
00:48:12,829 --> 00:48:16,495
It's nobody's fault.
It's just biology.

982
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:20,486
So what if it's not our blood?

983
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:22,697
If it is meant to be,

984
00:48:23,071 --> 00:48:24,839
that's just as good.

985
00:48:24,867 --> 00:48:26,725
Just as right.

986
00:48:29,575 --> 00:48:30,931
Maybe...

987
00:48:31,338 --> 00:48:33,236
- Maybe--
- No, no.

988
00:48:33,261 --> 00:48:34,915
No "maybe".

989
00:48:36,433 --> 00:48:37,867
You know,

990
00:48:38,237 --> 00:48:40,557
part of why you coach,

991
00:48:42,248 --> 00:48:44,327
there's a daddy in you,

992
00:48:44,807 --> 00:48:46,734
you never had.

993
00:48:48,076 --> 00:48:49,529
And now,

994
00:48:49,587 --> 00:48:51,867
there's a child out there,

995
00:48:52,158 --> 00:48:54,432
maybe, right now,

996
00:48:54,478 --> 00:48:56,547
that needs us...

997
00:48:57,085 --> 00:48:59,768
as much as we need him.

998
00:49:01,228 --> 00:49:02,844
A son.

999
00:49:04,259 --> 00:49:06,543
Your son.

1000
00:49:08,775 --> 00:49:10,234
Our...

1001
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:12,554
son.

1002
00:49:21,433 --> 00:49:22,826
Okay.

1003
00:49:24,848 --> 00:49:26,246
Okay.

1004
00:49:30,325 --> 00:49:31,995
Thank you, baby.

1005
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,463
Okay.

1006
00:49:41,495 --> 00:49:43,490
Tonight, we open with Ideal,

1007
00:49:43,515 --> 00:49:45,903
who whipped us twice last year.

1008
00:49:46,248 --> 00:49:48,125
Whipped us good.

1009
00:49:49,315 --> 00:49:50,331
Six.

1010
00:49:50,356 --> 00:49:52,417
What does that number mean?

1011
00:49:52,711 --> 00:49:54,325
How many wins
we had last year?

1012
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:55,831
- Six.
- Six wins.

1013
00:49:55,856 --> 00:49:57,030
That's the most...

1014
00:49:57,055 --> 00:49:58,993
any girls team
from Middleton's won...

1015
00:49:59,026 --> 00:50:01,307
out of 22 regular season games.

1016
00:50:01,618 --> 00:50:03,061
Six.

1017
00:50:03,227 --> 00:50:04,960
Not even a tournament win.

1018
00:50:04,992 --> 00:50:06,283
Ever.

1019
00:50:09,646 --> 00:50:11,471
Now, ask yourself.

1020
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:14,955
And measure this against
who you think you are in this life.

1021
00:50:15,921 --> 00:50:18,226
Is 6 an acceptable number?

1022
00:50:18,363 --> 00:50:19,495
No.

1023
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:21,383
- Is it?
- No, Coach.

1024
00:50:21,422 --> 00:50:23,584
- Is it?
- No, Coach!

1025
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:27,723
Then, show me.

1026
00:50:27,747 --> 00:50:29,232
Come on, let's go!

1027
00:50:29,257 --> 00:50:30,860
Let's go, girls.

1028
00:50:53,324 --> 00:50:54,958
Let's go!
Right here, come on!

1029
00:50:57,653 --> 00:50:59,859
Yeah! Woo hoo-hoo!

1030
00:51:13,168 --> 00:51:15,183
Yeah, that's it.

1031
00:51:26,982 --> 00:51:29,211
- Mrs. Clay Driscoll?
- Yes.

1032
00:51:29,236 --> 00:51:30,602
Lucille Shumard,

1033
00:51:30,627 --> 00:51:32,241
State Welfare Department,

1034
00:51:32,266 --> 00:51:34,205
your adoption application.

1035
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:37,249
Oh, my God!

1036
00:51:38,798 --> 00:51:40,646
Just one second.

1037
00:51:43,214 --> 00:51:44,833
Good Lord!

1038
00:51:47,387 --> 00:51:49,692
Jean, where's my pants?

1039
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:54,282
Goodness!
We do apologize.

1040
00:51:55,617 --> 00:51:57,519
You caught us by a surprise.

1041
00:51:57,551 --> 00:51:59,192
That's the idea.

1042
00:51:59,271 --> 00:52:00,486
I'm Jean.

1043
00:52:00,511 --> 00:52:02,080
This is Clay.

1044
00:52:02,134 --> 00:52:03,431
Ma'am.

1045
00:52:03,456 --> 00:52:05,035
Shouldn't take an hour. I'll, um...

1046
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:07,222
Look around,
take some pictures,

1047
00:52:07,247 --> 00:52:09,407
and we'll visit. So...

1048
00:52:16,497 --> 00:52:18,545
I hope, we start
trucking it over to here.

1049
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,264
Looks like Russian
needle to put in.

1050
00:52:20,295 --> 00:52:21,743
Coach.

1051
00:52:22,952 --> 00:52:24,687
It's personal.

1052
00:52:25,567 --> 00:52:27,474
Excuse me, Hugh.

1053
00:52:27,792 --> 00:52:29,673
It's my shorts.

1054
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,123
They splitted last game.

1055
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,284
And Mama sew them back,

1056
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:34,205
- but the stitches...
- Mm-mm.

1057
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:36,213
just gave again.

1058
00:52:37,092 --> 00:52:38,806
Get down!

1059
00:52:39,376 --> 00:52:41,146
Let's try it again!

1060
00:52:41,332 --> 00:52:43,425
Come on. Come on!

1061
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,097
- What's wrong?
- It's these damn old uniforms.

1062
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:47,556
Candy hanging out of her pants.

1063
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,419
I gotta go get Mama.

1064
00:52:56,163 --> 00:52:59,796
Now, the school board meeting
of October 19th in session.

1065
00:52:59,821 --> 00:53:01,737
Public comments?

1066
00:53:02,149 --> 00:53:03,419
Next item.

1067
00:53:03,451 --> 00:53:06,733
Approval of minutes for
the September regular meeting.

1068
00:53:06,851 --> 00:53:08,227
Do I hear motion?

1069
00:53:08,252 --> 00:53:09,254
- So moved.
- Wait.

1070
00:53:09,279 --> 00:53:10,298
- Second?
- Uh, wait.

1071
00:53:10,323 --> 00:53:14,227
Um, it says in the agenda:
Public comment comes first.

1072
00:53:14,266 --> 00:53:15,415
It did.

1073
00:53:15,443 --> 00:53:17,563
Well, the meeting is called for seven,

1074
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:20,884
and, uh, yeah, I have
seven now, a minute till.

1075
00:53:21,936 --> 00:53:24,007
- Mine says different.
- Come on, Ellis.

1076
00:53:24,032 --> 00:53:25,818
What, there are six,
seven people here?

1077
00:53:25,843 --> 00:53:27,574
- Let him have his say.
- Not personal.

1078
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,486
- Mile Gerson from the Meritt.
- Sir.

1079
00:53:29,518 --> 00:53:31,092
Motion passes.
Next item:

1080
00:53:31,117 --> 00:53:33,908
Approval of District
warrants and claims.

1081
00:53:36,038 --> 00:53:37,434
You'll want to see, uh,

1082
00:53:37,459 --> 00:53:39,314
superintendent, Spainhower,
about that, son.

1083
00:53:39,339 --> 00:53:41,130
Uh, he told me to come here.

1084
00:53:41,155 --> 00:53:42,746
You already did.
Next item.

1085
00:53:42,771 --> 00:53:46,837
No, sir. It was just you
I talked to last time, not them.

1086
00:53:47,043 --> 00:53:48,933
Anyway, that was last season.

1087
00:53:48,967 --> 00:53:50,830
And this year, it's worse.

1088
00:53:51,118 --> 00:53:54,629
Our girls need new uniforms
and warm-ups bad.

1089
00:53:54,793 --> 00:53:57,371
Uh, rules recommend two sets
for home and away,

1090
00:53:57,396 --> 00:53:58,522
and all we got is one.

1091
00:53:58,547 --> 00:54:00,574
That's maybe seven years old, and...

1092
00:54:00,621 --> 00:54:02,542
been hemmed so many times,

1093
00:54:02,567 --> 00:54:05,481
they split on my two-guard
at Medfield Friday.

1094
00:54:05,736 --> 00:54:07,729
Uh, warm-ups,
we don't even bother with.

1095
00:54:07,754 --> 00:54:09,549
They're boys' hand-me-downs, and...

1096
00:54:09,574 --> 00:54:11,779
about two sizes too big.

1097
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:14,074
Half of them,
the zippers are broke.

1098
00:54:14,177 --> 00:54:16,281
We look like hobos.

1099
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,343
Now, you said last year,

1100
00:54:21,368 --> 00:54:23,271
you couldn't on account
of the drought,

1101
00:54:23,306 --> 00:54:24,614
and girls don't draw.

1102
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:27,371
Well, the droughts over.
Thank God.

1103
00:54:27,446 --> 00:54:29,651
And people are paying
to see us play now.

1104
00:54:29,691 --> 00:54:32,453
Plus, and no disrespect,
Mr. Brand,

1105
00:54:32,631 --> 00:54:34,108
our team is 6 and 1...

1106
00:54:34,142 --> 00:54:37,459
while your nephew's boys,
uh, 2 and 5.

1107
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,249
Now, you ask anyone,

1108
00:54:40,423 --> 00:54:42,553
these girls are the finest,
hardest-working,

1109
00:54:42,578 --> 00:54:44,753
the most unselfish kids in school,

1110
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:47,493
and they deserve
what everybody...

1111
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:49,807
takes for granted in this county.

1112
00:54:50,101 --> 00:54:52,095
They've earned this.

1113
00:54:54,594 --> 00:54:56,160
Alright then, Mr. Driscoll,

1114
00:54:56,185 --> 00:54:58,039
- we will consider it.
- When?

1115
00:54:58,089 --> 00:55:00,596
Public comments are just that.

1116
00:55:00,682 --> 00:55:02,835
You've had your two minutes.

1117
00:55:03,186 --> 00:55:04,702
If there's a board consensus,

1118
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:07,269
we'll put it on next month's
conference agenda.

1119
00:55:07,308 --> 00:55:09,056
Gentlemen, item three is up.

1120
00:55:09,089 --> 00:55:10,234
- Next month?
- Approval--

1121
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,704
Well, that's almost December.

1122
00:55:11,729 --> 00:55:14,272
- It'll take at least a month to get--
- Approval of District...

1123
00:55:14,297 --> 00:55:17,289
- warrants and claims.
- It can't wait any longer.

1124
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,129
Sit down, you.

1125
00:55:29,098 --> 00:55:30,559
No.

1126
00:55:31,941 --> 00:55:33,532
Clay.

1127
00:55:34,025 --> 00:55:35,847
- Clay.
- No.

1128
00:55:37,942 --> 00:55:40,189
I'll pay for them
out of my own pocket.

1129
00:55:40,237 --> 00:55:42,043
If that's what it takes.

1130
00:55:42,118 --> 00:55:45,348
But, these girls have gone
without long enough.

1131
00:55:46,022 --> 00:55:49,035
Item three is: Approval of District
warrants and claims.

1132
00:55:49,059 --> 00:55:50,542
Discussion?

1133
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:52,734
Fine.

1134
00:55:54,123 --> 00:55:55,972
The reason he can afford to is...

1135
00:55:55,997 --> 00:55:57,163
we're the only district...

1136
00:55:57,188 --> 00:55:58,903
generous enough
and stupid enough...

1137
00:55:58,928 --> 00:56:01,598
to be paying a boys
salary to a girls coach.

1138
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:03,870
Write it down scripe.

1139
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:27,067
Pride! Pride!

1140
00:56:27,131 --> 00:56:28,543
Pride! Pride!

1141
00:56:28,568 --> 00:56:29,862
Pride! Pride!

1142
00:56:29,927 --> 00:56:31,491
Pride! Pride! Pride!

1143
00:56:31,534 --> 00:56:33,025
Pride! Pride! Pride!

1144
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:34,351
Pride! Pride! Pride!

1145
00:56:34,383 --> 00:56:35,645
Pride! Pride! Pride!

1146
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:37,347
Pride! Pride! Pride!

1147
00:57:34,137 --> 00:57:35,228
Fifty two.

1148
00:57:37,879 --> 00:57:40,054
Hands up, hands up!

1149
00:57:43,072 --> 00:57:45,779
- Yeah!
- Good job, Candy.

1150
00:57:50,921 --> 00:57:52,759
Watch your pick right there.

1151
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:55,921
- Candy!
- Ow!

1152
00:57:55,961 --> 00:57:57,639
- Hey!
- Ow!

1153
00:57:57,905 --> 00:58:00,287
- No! That's foul!
- Ow!

1154
00:58:00,313 --> 00:58:02,789
Candy, honey, you alright?

1155
00:58:03,411 --> 00:58:05,393
Come on, Ref.
You gotta call those.

1156
00:58:05,418 --> 00:58:06,763
It's my knee.

1157
00:58:08,024 --> 00:58:09,571
We, we take care of you.

1158
00:58:09,596 --> 00:58:12,025
Now, don't you worry.
They'll take care of her.

1159
00:58:12,994 --> 00:58:15,247
- Ow!
- Next's up, girls.

1160
00:58:22,051 --> 00:58:24,117
Clay, someone here to see you.

1161
00:58:24,157 --> 00:58:25,706
Who is it?

1162
00:58:26,479 --> 00:58:29,201
Dreaming of "the fast",
look what shows up.

1163
00:58:29,226 --> 00:58:31,004
Hi, Coach.

1164
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:34,065
She's got something to ask you.

1165
00:58:34,547 --> 00:58:37,729
I sure like to play basketball again.

1166
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,055
- Make that next time.
- I will.

1167
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,861
Come on, now.

1168
00:58:46,366 --> 00:58:49,028
Just because you're a mama,
it ain't no excuse.

1169
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:50,266
Come on, now.

1170
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:51,462
Oh.

1171
00:58:51,492 --> 00:58:53,144
Do it again.

1172
00:59:07,508 --> 00:59:10,188
Hugh, I've, I've a crazy idea.

1173
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:13,338
And, uh, I was wondering
if you could help me.

1174
00:59:16,842 --> 00:59:18,855
Say that again.

1175
00:59:19,136 --> 00:59:20,665
Yeah, with Brawley,

1176
00:59:20,704 --> 00:59:22,937
I should have seen it coming.

1177
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:25,172
Well, with Spainhower, that little...

1178
00:59:25,197 --> 00:59:26,287
Yeah.

1179
00:59:26,326 --> 00:59:29,268
So, they trumped this policy up.

1180
00:59:29,427 --> 00:59:31,187
Rescind my bonus.

1181
00:59:31,213 --> 00:59:32,623
Cut my pay.

1182
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:34,458
Their way of firing me.

1183
00:59:34,483 --> 00:59:36,336
Knowing I wouldn't stand for it.

1184
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,146
And, and your wife?

1185
00:59:38,222 --> 00:59:40,490
Well, she's still at Wilson.

1186
00:59:40,807 --> 00:59:42,980
But, they won't renew
her contract in June.

1187
00:59:43,004 --> 00:59:45,688
Aw. So, you're gone.

1188
00:59:46,392 --> 00:59:48,126
Yeah. Both of us.

1189
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,448
After 30 years.

1190
00:59:49,479 --> 00:59:52,839
Oh, I feel awful about this.

1191
00:59:53,085 --> 00:59:54,775
You've been so good to me, Hugh.

1192
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,350
You've been so good to the girls.

1193
00:59:57,494 --> 00:59:58,739
No.

1194
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:00,623
They're lucky to have you.

1195
01:00:00,693 --> 01:00:02,509
Whole town is.

1196
01:00:02,825 --> 01:00:04,018
You've done a heck of a job.

1197
01:00:04,043 --> 01:00:05,621
With you sit right next to me.

1198
01:00:05,654 --> 01:00:06,797
Nah.

1199
01:00:06,822 --> 01:00:08,769
You be careful, though.

1200
01:00:09,251 --> 01:00:11,020
Who they're really after is you.

1201
01:00:11,053 --> 01:00:12,163
Mm.

1202
01:00:12,197 --> 01:00:14,643
Brawley told Spainhower
last September.

1203
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:16,270
Find a way.

1204
01:00:16,316 --> 01:00:18,415
You ticked him off, Clay.
You and Jean, both.

1205
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:20,020
Since the day I showed up.

1206
01:00:20,061 --> 01:00:22,827
And what's it about me
that he so can't stand?

1207
01:00:23,259 --> 01:00:25,816
Hell, you're young,
you're hard-headed.

1208
01:00:26,062 --> 01:00:28,660
You won't kiss his ass
like he's used to.

1209
01:00:34,306 --> 01:00:36,547
You know, times are changing.

1210
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,369
But, not for him.
Not for Ellis.

1211
01:00:39,624 --> 01:00:41,658
And never here.

1212
01:00:49,961 --> 01:00:52,359
I know, what you're thinking.

1213
01:00:53,889 --> 01:00:55,781
I bet, you don't.

1214
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:59,098
I bet, you thought that first day,

1215
01:00:59,466 --> 01:01:01,628
what a mistake it was
you coming here.

1216
01:01:01,674 --> 01:01:03,305
You're wrong.

1217
01:01:04,149 --> 01:01:05,946
What then?

1218
01:01:08,596 --> 01:01:09,747
No.

1219
01:01:09,778 --> 01:01:11,469
Come on.

1220
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,382
Winning district.

1221
01:01:14,744 --> 01:01:17,829
Maybe, regionals even are coming close.

1222
01:01:18,121 --> 01:01:20,209
- But, I couldn't ask--
- Clay.

1223
01:01:20,265 --> 01:01:22,127
Spit it out.

1224
01:01:24,452 --> 01:01:26,683
We're 9 and 5
since Candy got hurt.

1225
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:29,462
We could have won,
what, two, three?

1226
01:01:29,487 --> 01:01:31,224
- Four. Maybe, four.
- Yeah. Maybe, 4 of those games.

1227
01:01:31,249 --> 01:01:33,692
But, sparks are missing. Now...

1228
01:01:34,513 --> 01:01:36,604
with Frances Bonner
wanting to play again,

1229
01:01:36,629 --> 01:01:38,232
she might be just what we need.

1230
01:01:38,257 --> 01:01:41,236
Now, I know her rotten
deal with classes, but...

1231
01:01:41,394 --> 01:01:43,977
Hugh, can you help me out
with just one last time.

1232
01:01:44,002 --> 01:01:45,742
After what I just told you?

1233
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:47,083
Son, are you out of your mind?

1234
01:01:47,108 --> 01:01:48,989
Help me get this girl
back on the team.

1235
01:01:49,015 --> 01:01:50,404
You know the ED code,

1236
01:01:50,429 --> 01:01:52,234
the policies,
the technicalities.

1237
01:01:52,259 --> 01:01:53,838
I don't, I don't know
nothing about that.

1238
01:01:53,863 --> 01:01:55,376
Wait. Wait a minute.

1239
01:01:55,608 --> 01:01:58,126
Is this for you,
or about Brawley?

1240
01:02:00,611 --> 01:02:02,603
It's about "winning".

1241
01:02:03,635 --> 01:02:05,794
That's what this is about.

1242
01:02:09,252 --> 01:02:11,604
You want it that bad?

1243
01:02:12,637 --> 01:02:14,192
Don't you?

1244
01:02:22,342 --> 01:02:24,247
What is this Frances Bonner business?

1245
01:02:24,272 --> 01:02:25,784
What it says it is.

1246
01:02:26,307 --> 01:02:27,823
I won't be threatened.

1247
01:02:27,847 --> 01:02:29,307
It's no threat.

1248
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,517
Mr. Spainhower,
Frances is a good student.

1249
01:02:31,556 --> 01:02:33,062
She makes A's and B's,

1250
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:35,689
team parents know her situation,
they're okay with it.

1251
01:02:35,727 --> 01:02:38,301
All they're saying is
they'll write letters of support.

1252
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,804
If the request is denied.

1253
01:02:39,829 --> 01:02:42,183
Oh, well, John Stovall
in particular, I see.

1254
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:44,870
- Well, he's a parent.
- Well, so is Frances Bonner.

1255
01:02:44,895 --> 01:02:47,099
But, there's no legal rules
stopping her playing.

1256
01:02:47,136 --> 01:02:48,484
You know, from the state, I mean.

1257
01:02:48,509 --> 01:02:51,544
- But, board policy is clear.
- Aside from board policy.

1258
01:02:51,569 --> 01:02:54,180
According to civil law
on the education code.

1259
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,808
You know, that sort of thing.

1260
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:57,011
Right, Mr. Spainhower?

1261
01:02:57,036 --> 01:02:59,875
- I'm not the district counsel.
- Well, you can ask them.

1262
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,376
Legal opinions cost money.

1263
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,562
Have the board do it then.

1264
01:03:02,587 --> 01:03:04,846
You know very well,
Mr. Brawley's at his place in Mexico.

1265
01:03:04,871 --> 01:03:06,722
Then Mr. Brand.

1266
01:03:07,303 --> 01:03:09,153
I'm warning you, Driscoll.

1267
01:03:09,178 --> 01:03:10,758
Don't push it.

1268
01:03:10,814 --> 01:03:12,306
Fine.

1269
01:03:12,576 --> 01:03:13,587
In the meantime,

1270
01:03:13,612 --> 01:03:15,391
as long as it's not
on school property,

1271
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:16,920
there is no jurisdiction over...

1272
01:03:16,945 --> 01:03:19,620
Frances practicing with team
as I can interpret.

1273
01:03:19,706 --> 01:03:21,668
As you can interpret.

1274
01:03:21,747 --> 01:03:23,623
Am I wrong?

1275
01:03:42,365 --> 01:03:47,241
<i>♪ You can change the name of an old song ♪</i>

1276
01:03:47,318 --> 01:03:51,947

<i>♪ 'Cause time has changed everything ♪</i>

1284
01:04:41,341 --> 01:04:42,660
Go in.

1285
01:04:44,713 --> 01:04:47,052
You want to see me,
Mr. Spainhower?

1286
01:04:47,272 --> 01:04:48,887
I want no part of this any more.

1287
01:04:48,912 --> 01:04:51,459
Too many people are upset.

1288
01:04:52,534 --> 01:04:55,246
If I can't make the ruling,
I'm leaving it up to you.

1289
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:58,406
You can play the Bonner girl
if you want.

1290
01:04:58,818 --> 01:05:01,163
You're right, there's no
code violation involved.

1291
01:05:01,188 --> 01:05:03,341
So, I'm, uh, not gonna stop you.

1292
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:05,334
I also won't give you my permission.

1293
01:05:05,376 --> 01:05:08,179
Just the authority to decide.

1294
01:05:08,689 --> 01:05:11,554
Congratulations, Driscoll,
it's your call.

1295
01:05:11,646 --> 01:05:13,121
I do...

1296
01:05:13,163 --> 01:05:15,307
I do wish you the best.

1297
01:05:15,525 --> 01:05:18,126
But, I wash my hands
of the whole thing.

1298
01:05:20,911 --> 01:05:22,449
Mr. Driscoll.

1299
01:05:22,529 --> 01:05:24,687
- Mr. Driscoll.
- Yes, ma'am.

1300
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,355
I have to warn you.

1301
01:05:26,385 --> 01:05:28,095
Mr. Brand...

1302
01:05:28,493 --> 01:05:31,509
Mr. Brand came by the office earlier.

1303
01:05:32,108 --> 01:05:36,472
Normally, Mr. Spainhower
has me place all his phone calls.

1304
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,123
But, they made one without me.

1305
01:05:39,897 --> 01:05:41,754
And I eavesdropped.

1306
01:05:41,817 --> 01:05:43,954
I feel terrible, but I did.

1307
01:05:43,985 --> 01:05:45,053
And...

1308
01:05:45,078 --> 01:05:48,214
they were calling Mr. Brawley
down in Mexico.

1309
01:05:48,668 --> 01:05:51,682
He's staying down there on purpose.

1310
01:05:51,842 --> 01:05:53,659
They want you...

1311
01:05:53,714 --> 01:05:56,023
They want you to decide.

1312
01:05:56,048 --> 01:05:58,453
They want you to play Frances.

1313
01:05:58,478 --> 01:06:01,024
So, the board can fire you.

1314
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:03,031
Mr. Brawley said,

1315
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:07,027
you and Mr. Moreland
were troublemakers.

1316
01:06:07,067 --> 01:06:09,141
They had gotten rid of him,

1317
01:06:09,181 --> 01:06:11,501
and now, it was your turn.

1318
01:06:12,128 --> 01:06:14,113
Be careful, Mr. Driscoll.

1319
01:06:14,144 --> 01:06:16,620
It might not be worth it.

1320
01:06:18,328 --> 01:06:19,734
Thank you, Miss Rogers.

1321
01:06:19,778 --> 01:06:21,488
Mm-hm.

1322
01:06:48,031 --> 01:06:49,502
Hey, Coach!

1323
01:06:49,542 --> 01:06:51,907
Uh, Frances is inside.
You, you come about her play?

1324
01:06:51,932 --> 01:06:53,454
Uh, yeah, Johnny.

1325
01:06:53,479 --> 01:06:54,748
Um...

1326
01:06:55,427 --> 01:06:57,491
Well, she just made some coffee.
Come on in.

1327
01:06:57,522 --> 01:06:58,554
Well, uh, no.

1328
01:06:58,579 --> 01:07:00,111
Uh, uh, no, thanks, Johnny.

1329
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:01,578
You tell her...

1330
01:07:01,644 --> 01:07:04,184
You go on in there,
and you tell her...

1331
01:07:04,701 --> 01:07:06,072
um...

1332
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:15,830
you tell her...

1333
01:07:19,689 --> 01:07:21,467
you tell her,
she's going to the regional.

1334
01:07:21,492 --> 01:07:23,075
She's playing in the tournament.

1335
01:07:23,118 --> 01:07:25,693
Yeah! Man, oh man!
I knew it, I knew it.

1336
01:07:25,718 --> 01:07:27,509
I knew you'd do it, Coach.
I knew you'd do it.

1337
01:07:27,534 --> 01:07:28,880
Come on inside.
Come on in and tell her.

1338
01:07:28,909 --> 01:07:31,626
No, you go on and
you tell her yourself.

1339
01:07:32,133 --> 01:07:33,923
Thanks, Coach.

1340
01:07:34,914 --> 01:07:36,615
Frances!

1341
01:07:49,093 --> 01:07:50,757
Bring it in.

1342
01:07:52,051 --> 01:07:54,776
You've won more games
than any Middleton girls team ever.

1343
01:07:54,801 --> 01:07:56,411
Thirteen.

1344
01:07:57,848 --> 01:08:00,353
What number is acceptable now?

1345
01:08:00,418 --> 01:08:01,759
We're behind you.

1346
01:08:01,855 --> 01:08:03,990
- 1, 2, 3, pride!
- Pride!

1347
01:08:10,064 --> 01:08:12,168
Come on, Frances.

1348
01:08:13,392 --> 01:08:15,204
Push it, Frances.

1349
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,234
<i>Well, who had ever thought,</i>

1350
01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:55,077
<i>our Lady Cyclones
would whip Ideal, Thursday.</i>

1351
01:08:55,124 --> 01:08:56,333
<i>Okeene, Friday,</i>

1352
01:08:56,374 --> 01:08:58,939
<i>and win the district 2
tournament, Saturday,</i>

1353
01:08:58,964 --> 01:09:01,829
<i>stomping Bing, 57-51.</i>

1354
01:09:01,861 --> 01:09:04,983
<i>Now, it's on to the regionals
with the big dawgs.</i>

1355
01:09:05,166 --> 01:09:07,205
<i>Go, you Lady Cyclones!</i>

1356
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:09,105
<i>Pride!</i>

1357
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:12,830
Oh, my God!

1358
01:09:12,855 --> 01:09:15,684
- I bet, color TV.
- No.

1359
01:09:16,196 --> 01:09:17,545
Oh.

1360
01:09:17,582 --> 01:09:21,135
I am dead and gone to heaven.

1361
01:09:26,702 --> 01:09:28,218
Oh!

1362
01:09:28,607 --> 01:09:30,832
You won't believe this.

1363
01:09:32,132 --> 01:09:34,044
Look down there.

1364
01:09:34,272 --> 01:09:36,639
Well now, I have seen it all.

1365
01:09:36,844 --> 01:09:38,368
Mm-hm.

1366
01:09:39,906 --> 01:09:42,509
<i>And good evening everyone,
from Lawton, Oklahoma.</i>

1367
01:09:42,534 --> 01:09:45,226
<i>Both are the division 2
girls high school basketball,</i>

1368
01:09:45,251 --> 01:09:46,646
<i>western regionals.</i>

1369
01:09:46,671 --> 01:09:48,847
<i>Now tonight, our final pits
the highly talented...</i>

1370
01:09:48,872 --> 01:09:51,015
<i>Ridge Raiders red vets
from over Cordell...</i>

1371
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,491
<i>against the Lady Cyclones
from Middleton.</i>

1372
01:09:53,518 --> 01:09:55,369
<i>The team that frankly,
up until now,</i>

1373
01:09:55,394 --> 01:09:56,902
<i>not many folks had ever heard of.</i>

1374
01:09:56,927 --> 01:09:59,627
<i>They're #4 seed in their own
district tournament,</i>

1375
01:09:59,652 --> 01:10:02,299
<i>and these Middleton kids with
their second year head coach,</i>

1376
01:10:02,324 --> 01:10:03,678
<i>Clay Driscoll, had knocked off...</i>

1377
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:05,726
<i>five straight higher ranked teams.</i>

1378
01:10:05,758 --> 01:10:06,786
<i>Now, here they are,</i>

1379
01:10:06,811 --> 01:10:08,094
<i>matched up against this deep...</i>

1380
01:10:08,122 --> 01:10:09,657
<i>and talented Ridge Raiders
red squad...</i>

1381
01:10:09,682 --> 01:10:11,410
<i>for a chance to go on
to Oklahoma City...</i>

1382
01:10:11,435 --> 01:10:12,716
- Are these girls something?
<i>- to play for that...</i>

1383
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:14,745
- Woo-hoo! Yeah.
<i>- They can't wait.</i>

1384
01:10:22,332 --> 01:10:25,398
<i>And hey, Middleton down
by only 5 point-ish...</i>

1385
01:10:29,456 --> 01:10:32,482
<i>Ridge now with the ball,
and they bring the ball down...</i>

1386
01:10:39,121 --> 01:10:40,406
<i>Oh, good shot and wow!</i>

1387
01:10:40,431 --> 01:10:42,907
<i>That put Raiders up by 3.
That could be the back breaker.</i>

1388
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:45,311
<i>Under two minutes. Now,
lots of noise in the gym tonight.</i>

1389
01:10:45,336 --> 01:10:48,021
<i>Here come the Lady Cyclones.
They just won't go away.</i>

1390
01:10:53,479 --> 01:10:56,042
<i>Selman with the rebound
and put it right back up.</i>

1391
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:07,487
- Pat?
<i>- Pat just couldn't stand up.</i>

1392
01:11:07,512 --> 01:11:10,065
<i>She grabs her right ankle,
and it does not look good.</i>

1393
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:13,771
<i>Well, 18.94 tonight,
a big for Pat Thomson.</i>

1394
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,422
What is it?

1395
01:11:15,447 --> 01:11:16,661
My ankle.

1396
01:11:17,821 --> 01:11:19,912
<i>Look, it could be the end
of the playoff road...</i>

1397
01:11:19,937 --> 01:11:21,607
<i>for the Lady Cyclones.</i>

1398
01:11:21,729 --> 01:11:24,059
It's alright, it's alright,
it's alright.

1399
01:11:24,111 --> 01:11:25,867
Now, listen to me,
all of you.

1400
01:11:25,892 --> 01:11:26,993
Focus.

1401
01:11:27,028 --> 01:11:28,551
Tune everything out.

1402
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:29,992
Forget everything.

1403
01:11:30,017 --> 01:11:31,682
You're here because you earned it.

1404
01:11:31,707 --> 01:11:32,908
Settle down.

1405
01:11:32,933 --> 01:11:34,939
Get in there and show them
how Middleton play.

1406
01:11:34,964 --> 01:11:36,242
- 1, 2, 3, pride!
- Pride!

1407
01:11:36,267 --> 01:11:39,176
<i>About 20 seconds now,
and Ridge up by 1.</i>

1408
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:40,959
<i>Put the pressure on defense now...</i>

1409
01:11:40,984 --> 01:11:42,671
<i>- from the Lady Cyclones.</i>
- Check the ball.

1410
01:11:43,996 --> 01:11:46,742
<i>Working on that,
and that's stolen by Grove.</i>

1411
01:11:46,929 --> 01:11:49,173
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
It's only a second.</i>

1412
01:11:59,446 --> 01:12:02,390
Coach Driscoll cannot believe it.
Lady Cyclones cannot believe it.

1413
01:12:02,669 --> 01:12:04,023
What you say?

1414
01:12:04,056 --> 01:12:06,910
- We're going to the state!
<i>- They go on to State Championship.</i>

1415
01:12:06,959 --> 01:12:09,338
We're going to the state!

1416
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:19,388
Well, newspapers in Stillwater,

1417
01:12:19,413 --> 01:12:21,771
back in Norman,
good Lord, everywhere...

1418
01:12:21,796 --> 01:12:24,042
seems to be interested in
the Lady Cyclones.

1419
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,860
Even TV.

1420
01:12:27,257 --> 01:12:29,313
No, it's not going to his head.

1421
01:12:29,355 --> 01:12:32,444
His head is already too big as it is.

1422
01:12:33,517 --> 01:12:35,054
I will.

1423
01:12:35,179 --> 01:12:36,941
Yeah, you too, Curtis.

1424
01:12:36,994 --> 01:12:38,279
Bye.

1425
01:12:40,345 --> 01:12:42,305
You know, you could
answer once or twice.

1426
01:12:42,330 --> 01:12:43,441
Calls are all for you.

1427
01:12:43,466 --> 01:12:44,952
I'm too busy.

1428
01:12:45,092 --> 01:12:48,011
Oh, Clay Driscoll, basketball genius.

1429
01:12:48,036 --> 01:12:49,160
Uh, come here.

1430
01:12:49,186 --> 01:12:51,238
I want to show you something.

1431
01:12:52,198 --> 01:12:54,176
I was thinking,
"Edward Wade Driscoll",

1432
01:12:54,201 --> 01:12:55,914
you know, from my mama side?

1433
01:12:55,945 --> 01:12:58,305
Or maybe, "James Dale Driscoll",
you know, from your dad.

1434
01:12:58,330 --> 01:13:01,198
You know, nice,
strong names for a boy.

1435
01:13:04,282 --> 01:13:06,206
Well, I was thinking more of...

1436
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:08,737
Paul Newman Driscoll.

1437
01:13:09,556 --> 01:13:11,087
From me.

1438
01:13:17,175 --> 01:13:19,607
Let's go.
Get on the bus, girls.

1439
01:13:20,967 --> 01:13:22,371
Alright, get.

1440
01:13:22,395 --> 01:13:23,705
- Good luck, Ginger.
- Bye.

1441
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:24,928
Bye.

1442
01:13:24,953 --> 01:13:27,194
- Pat, you're limping awful bad.
- I'm fine.

1443
01:13:28,638 --> 01:13:29,861
Alright. Come on.

1444
01:13:33,495 --> 01:13:35,141
Come on, now.
We'll never get straight.

1445
01:13:35,166 --> 01:13:36,426
Come on.

1446
01:13:37,527 --> 01:13:39,376
Susan, Liz, come on.

1447
01:13:39,401 --> 01:13:40,781
Good luck!

1460

Coach.

1461
01:14:39,982 --> 01:14:42,292
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

1462
01:14:42,516 --> 01:14:44,222
It's from us.

1463
01:14:44,286 --> 01:14:45,882
Thank you all.

1464
01:14:47,412 --> 01:14:49,837
Well, the team wanted me
to say something.

1465
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:52,401
Especially, the seniors.

1466
01:14:52,735 --> 01:14:54,530
So, uh...

1467
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:58,761
We know, you never wanted us.

1468
01:14:59,007 --> 01:15:01,206
You wanted boys.

1469
01:15:01,507 --> 01:15:04,255
And we understand.

1470
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:07,576
Girls don't get scholarships, or...

1471
01:15:07,676 --> 01:15:10,548
play in the Olympics or Pro's.

1472
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:12,968
Most of us won't even go to college.

1473
01:15:13,011 --> 01:15:15,569
So for us, this is it.

1474
01:15:15,805 --> 01:15:18,244
Our one-moment to compete.

1475
01:15:18,473 --> 01:15:20,661
Put on spotless new uniforms, and...

1476
01:15:20,714 --> 01:15:22,881
represent Middleton.

1477
01:15:22,981 --> 01:15:27,405
And be proud of us more than just
future farmers' and rangers' wives.

1478
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:33,397
Though, there's nothing wrong with that.

1479
01:15:37,691 --> 01:15:40,763
But, it's the other you gave us:

1480
01:15:43,416 --> 01:15:45,701
"The more than that."

1481
01:15:51,654 --> 01:15:53,138
Now,

1482
01:15:53,262 --> 01:15:55,260
open your gift.

1483
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,140
Okay.

1484
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,690
Oh.

1485
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:30,991
For you.

1486
01:16:31,021 --> 01:16:32,830
For believing in us.

1487
01:16:32,871 --> 01:16:34,795
For this season and last,

1488
01:16:34,874 --> 01:16:36,975
no matter what happens tomorrow.

1489
01:16:37,015 --> 01:16:39,183
For the games we won...

1490
01:16:39,257 --> 01:16:40,592
and lost.

1491
01:16:40,624 --> 01:16:42,627
For treating us the same as boys.

1492
01:16:42,659 --> 01:16:44,181
Expecting more,

1493
01:16:44,206 --> 01:16:45,828
and making us get it.

1494
01:16:45,872 --> 01:16:47,622
From all of us.

1495
01:16:48,998 --> 01:16:51,192
We love you.

1496
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:16,306
Uh.

1497
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:17,772
Well.

1498
01:17:18,749 --> 01:17:21,125
I'll always, uh,

1499
01:17:23,014 --> 01:17:25,165
I'll always, uh...

1500
01:17:58,078 --> 01:17:59,893
I don't know, I don't know.

1501
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:02,107
Well, at least,
it's better than yesterday.

1502
01:18:02,131 --> 01:18:04,243
Coach, I can play.
Really.

1503
01:18:04,267 --> 01:18:05,862
Show me.
Take in your hole.

1504
01:18:05,897 --> 01:18:07,127
Let's go.

1505
01:18:07,152 --> 01:18:08,373
Come on, come on!

1506
01:18:08,398 --> 01:18:10,041
Go, go right.

1507
01:18:10,230 --> 01:18:12,274
That's good, that's good.
Come on back.

1508
01:18:12,613 --> 01:18:14,542
Closer. Let's do it.

1509
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:16,143
Good, good, good.

1510
01:18:16,203 --> 01:18:17,260
Come on.

1511
01:18:17,285 --> 01:18:19,016
Crossover.

1512
01:18:25,061 --> 01:18:26,486
Baby, are you alright?

1513
01:18:26,518 --> 01:18:27,696
I'm fine.

1514
01:18:27,721 --> 01:18:30,088
I'm fine, doggone it!

1515
01:19:30,021 --> 01:19:31,561
What?

1516
01:19:32,619 --> 01:19:35,277
<i>Fans, we're few minutes
to tip-off for the state final.</i>

1517
01:19:35,302 --> 01:19:37,087
<i>And unlikely, a senior...</i>

1518
01:19:37,112 --> 01:19:38,302
Please.

1519
01:19:38,336 --> 01:19:40,987
We just come to say
"good luck" to Ginger.

1520
01:19:41,012 --> 01:19:42,523
I'm sorry, Coach.

1521
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:45,531
Come along.

1522
01:19:45,556 --> 01:19:47,411
<i>I asked Middleton's coach,
Clay Driscoll,</i>

1523
01:19:47,436 --> 01:19:49,437
<i>"How they got here?"
"How'd it take his effort?"</i>

1524
01:19:49,462 --> 01:19:51,439
<i>He said, his girls hatched challenge,</i>

1525
01:19:51,464 --> 01:19:53,613
<i>and "no quit" at all.</i>

1526
01:19:53,670 --> 01:19:55,094
<i>But this, he, he laughed.</i>

1527
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:57,021
<i>He said, he couldn't
really explain it himself.</i>

1528
01:19:57,046 --> 01:20:00,110
<i>Maybe, a combination
of heart and pure luck.</i>

1529
01:20:00,181 --> 01:20:02,047
<i>I call it old-fashioned grit.</i>

1530
01:20:02,072 --> 01:20:04,669
<i>Hard work and great coaching, folks.</i>

1531
01:20:04,694 --> 01:20:07,424
<i>Well, tonight, these kids will
need something extra special...</i>

1532
01:20:07,449 --> 01:20:09,483
<i>with their best forward,
Pat Thompson,</i>

1533
01:20:09,508 --> 01:20:11,884
<i>down with an ankle
injury that she got...</i>

1534
01:20:11,909 --> 01:20:14,519
<i>in that hard-fought regional final...</i>

1535
01:20:14,544 --> 01:20:16,843
<i>against Ridge High School
in Cordell.</i>

1536
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:19,005
<i>Now, I asked Dellaplane coach,
R.C. Pruitt,</i>

1537
01:20:19,030 --> 01:20:20,524
<i>"How'd he prepared for the game?"</i>

1538
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:22,501
<i>R.C. told me, never...</i>

1539
01:20:22,541 --> 01:20:24,412
<i>underestimate the country girls.</i>

1540
01:20:24,448 --> 01:20:27,737
<i>But, don't you underestimate
this Dellaplane program either.</i>

1541
01:20:27,784 --> 01:20:29,631
<i>Under that great Coach Pruitt,</i>

1542
01:20:29,707 --> 01:20:32,033
<i>they got three state championships.</i>

1543
01:20:32,058 --> 01:20:34,940
<i>And the winningest
girls record in Oklahoma...</i>

1544
01:20:34,965 --> 01:20:36,758
<i>over the past decade.</i>

1545
01:20:36,797 --> 01:20:38,008
<i>So, here we go.</i>

1546
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:39,270
<i>Big versus Little.</i>

1547
01:20:39,319 --> 01:20:40,699
<i>Country versus City.</i>

1548
01:20:40,747 --> 01:20:42,003
<i>A classic matchup,</i>

1549
01:20:42,028 --> 01:20:44,560
<i>certainly great for
soon ladies' prep sports.</i>

1550
01:20:44,592 --> 01:20:46,822
<i>Middleton High, with 18 and 6...</i>

1551
01:20:46,847 --> 01:20:49,325
<i>against Dellaplane, with 23 and 1,</i>

1552
01:20:49,357 --> 01:20:52,024
<i>led by their 6-foot-3,
all-state center,</i>

1553
01:20:52,054 --> 01:20:53,923
<i>Lucille Overlander.</i>

1554
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:56,496
<i>All-state guard and
district scoring champ,</i>

1555
01:20:56,527 --> 01:20:58,657
<i>Tammy Sharp.
That girl can run.</i>

1556
01:20:58,682 --> 01:21:01,121
<i>Marvella Qualls is another
all-star in the wing,</i>

1557
01:21:01,146 --> 01:21:04,288
<i>and 6-foot Delma Loftus
in the low post.</i>

1558
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:05,789
<i>A powerhouse, folks.</i>

1559
01:21:05,814 --> 01:21:08,860
<i>Indeed, speed, strength, great touch.</i>

1560
01:21:08,885 --> 01:21:11,212
<i>And the Dellaplane
high-tempo system.</i>

1561
01:21:11,237 --> 01:21:13,220
<i>We get an exciting game for you.</i>

1562
01:21:13,258 --> 01:21:15,206
<i>So, run your noses,
and pull up a chair,</i>

1563
01:21:15,231 --> 01:21:16,722
<i>get ready for the Oklahoma...</i>

1564
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:19,654
<i>- high school girls state final.</i>
- Use the arc but slow down.

1565
01:21:20,515 --> 01:21:21,940
Be yourselves.

1566
01:21:21,965 --> 01:21:24,892
And don't get rattled
when the bullying starts.

1567
01:21:24,947 --> 01:21:27,275
Because it'll start quick.

1568
01:21:27,959 --> 01:21:31,037
You just remember
who you all are out there.

1569
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:34,482
You're my girls.

1570
01:21:35,542 --> 01:21:37,085
Bring it in.

1571
01:21:39,707 --> 01:21:41,601
State champions.

1572
01:21:42,206 --> 01:21:43,666
- Pride!
<i>- The highly favored...</i>

1573
01:21:43,691 --> 01:21:46,058
<i>Coronets from Dellaplane
in the familiar gold silk,</i>

1574
01:21:46,082 --> 01:21:48,115
<i>and Middleton in grey and maroon shorts.</i>

1575
01:21:48,147 --> 01:21:49,185
<i>Thanks for joining us...</i>

1576
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:51,868
<i>for this Oklahoma
high school girls final.</i>

1577
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:54,870
<i>Official, Eugene Owen,
just about ready to tip it off.</i>

1578
01:21:54,914 --> 01:21:57,356
<i>Big Lucille Overlander
of Dellaplane has about...</i>

1579
01:21:57,381 --> 01:22:00,599
<i>six inches on the Cyclone,
Melba Johnson.</i>

1580
01:22:00,878 --> 01:22:03,468
<i>Coronets win the tip.
No surprise there.</i>

1581
01:22:03,511 --> 01:22:06,698
<i>And Qualls gets to Hillary Pratt,
who puts in for easy 2.</i>

1582
01:22:06,723 --> 01:22:07,889
<i>And Middleton with the ball,</i>

1583
01:22:07,914 --> 01:22:09,583
<i>Johnson tosses to Ginger Selman,</i>

1584
01:22:09,607 --> 01:22:10,871
<i>gets to Frances Price.</i>

1585
01:22:10,896 --> 01:22:13,641
<i>Price missed most of her senior year
when she went off to get married.</i>

1586
01:22:13,666 --> 01:22:15,228
<i>Dribbles it across mid-court stripe,</i>

1587
01:22:15,253 --> 01:22:18,039
<i>and holds the ball, setting up
the play for Middleton.</i>

1588
01:22:18,224 --> 01:22:20,514
<i>Now, right now, this is not
what we expect from Middleton.</i>

1589
01:22:20,546 --> 01:22:21,705
<i>Gonna let the air out of the ball.</i>

1590
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:22,857
<i>But you have to slow down.</i>

1591
01:22:22,882 --> 01:22:26,033
<i>They're just hamming up the horses
to run for this very athletic Josephine.</i>

1592
01:22:26,449 --> 01:22:27,465
<i>Alright.</i>

1593
01:22:27,490 --> 01:22:28,920
<i>Now, you can get
the boomers to come out.</i>

1594
01:22:28,952 --> 01:22:31,270
<i>Middleton gets the ball, moving
it finally to the pass-up high.</i>

1595
01:22:31,295 --> 01:22:33,018
<i>Price plays it off to Selman
on the right side.</i>

1596
01:22:33,043 --> 01:22:35,116
<i>#11, Selman brings it back,
across, right to left.</i>

1597
01:22:35,141 --> 01:22:37,909
- Slow down, slow down, slow down!
<i>- Sadie York coming across the other way.</i>

1598
01:22:37,934 --> 01:22:39,537
<i>Looks like they play
the game of four corners...</i>

1599
01:22:39,562 --> 01:22:41,014
<i>with keep-away out there.</i>

1600
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:43,936
<i>Driscoll wants to stick
with his slow-down.</i>

1601
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,037
<i>Pass left, dribble right.
Pass right, dribble left.</i>

1602
01:22:48,062 --> 01:22:50,172
<i>Price and Selman play catch.</i>

1603
01:22:50,373 --> 01:22:52,865
<i>There's a toss to the end
of the top of the key.</i>

1604
01:22:52,962 --> 01:22:55,074
<i>Then, back out to Price
who holds it up again.</i>

1605
01:22:55,099 --> 01:22:56,647
<i>Somebody needs to tell the Cyclones...</i>

1606
01:22:56,681 --> 01:22:58,565
<i>that you've got to score
sooner or later.</i>

1607
01:22:58,598 --> 01:22:59,950
Just call them foul.

1608
01:23:02,072 --> 01:23:04,070
It's okay.
We're gonna get it.

1609
01:23:04,095 --> 01:23:05,700
<i>Cyclones play with this slow-down, </i>

1610
01:23:05,725 --> 01:23:09,160
<i>that's the only way they've got a chance
against this running gun, and, uh...</i>

1611
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:11,370
<i>Forward left to pass to left side.</i>

1612
01:23:11,395 --> 01:23:13,125
<i>York dribbles over
to the right hand side.</i>

1613
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:14,832
<i>They're still playing keep-away.</i>

1614
01:23:14,857 --> 01:23:17,228
<i>Looks like Selman back over
to the left, back out.</i>

1615
01:23:17,253 --> 01:23:19,149
<i>Here in mid-court,
dribble, dribble, dribble.</i>

1616
01:23:19,174 --> 01:23:20,808
<i>That's what you get
with this slow-down.</i>

1617
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,889
<i>Dribbling, uh, right to left.</i>

1618
01:23:22,929 --> 01:23:24,866
<i>And York with the ball.</i>

1619
01:23:24,945 --> 01:23:26,464
<i>Pass over...</i>

1620
01:23:26,489 --> 01:23:28,762
<i>to the right hand side again.
Back to Selman.</i>

1621
01:23:28,787 --> 01:23:30,899
<i>Selman throws it inside
to Johnson who puts it up,</i>

1622
01:23:30,924 --> 01:23:32,754
<i>works it in for two.</i>

1623
01:23:32,976 --> 01:23:34,729
<i>It's taken about a half of the quarter,</i>

1624
01:23:34,754 --> 01:23:36,935
<i>but they did get some
into the basket there.</i>

1625
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,300
<i>Alright, I think, uh,
Cyclones slow-down playing,</i>

1626
01:23:39,325 --> 01:23:41,824
<i>I think they couldn't
hold the ball all night.</i>

1627
01:23:43,002 --> 01:23:45,717
<i>All-state guard, Tammy Shaw,
brings it up for the mighty Coronets.</i>

1628
01:23:45,742 --> 01:23:47,664
<i>Surprising number of
backers here for both teams.</i>

1629
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,197
<i>Looks like the whole town of Middleton
hopped on the Greyhound, maybe, here.</i>

1630
01:23:50,235 --> 01:23:52,203
<i>You can fit the whole school
on two buses.</i>

1631
01:23:52,228 --> 01:23:54,739
<i>Fans don't handle the ball,
but over and out of there.</i>

1632
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:56,930
<i>With that, the Coronets have the lead.</i>

1633
01:23:57,009 --> 01:23:58,431
<i>Go set the game now.</i>

1634
01:23:58,456 --> 01:23:59,836
<i>Brings the ball up for Cyclones.</i>

1635
01:23:59,861 --> 01:24:02,121
<i>Bad pass tipped away
by Dellaplane big center.</i>

1636
01:24:02,146 --> 01:24:04,432
<i>She runs the court,
gets the ball back,</i>

1637
01:24:04,701 --> 01:24:07,270
<i>and puts it up for two.</i>

1638
01:24:07,336 --> 01:24:09,279
<i>Real contrast between the coaches here.</i>

1639
01:24:09,304 --> 01:24:11,967
<i>R.C. Pruitt with the state's
best record of the past decade.</i>

1640
01:24:11,992 --> 01:24:13,840
<i>And Driscoll,
the new kid on the block.</i>

1641
01:24:13,865 --> 01:24:16,347
<i>Dellaplane now leads 8-to-4.</i>

1642
01:24:16,395 --> 01:24:20,097
Same thing, same thing.
Slow down, slow down.

1643
01:24:20,122 --> 01:24:23,931
<i>Selma brings the ball up slowly,
trying to control the tempo...</i>

1644
01:24:24,705 --> 01:24:27,131
<i>and had it stripped away
by the Coronets.</i>

1645
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,854
<i>They put it up,
but rolls off the rim.</i>

1646
01:24:29,919 --> 01:24:32,689
<i>And Dellaplane
puts it back up for two.</i>

1647
01:24:32,714 --> 01:24:34,679
<i>This Middleton team
is just overmatched.</i>

1648
01:24:34,704 --> 01:24:37,822
<i>There's a pass inside,
and another turnover.</i>

1649
01:24:39,191 --> 01:24:41,206
<i>Tammy Shaw, the Coronets,
puts back to her squad...</i>

1650
01:24:41,231 --> 01:24:43,275
<i>for a pass inside...</i>

1651
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:45,460
<i>for two.</i>

1652
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:50,672
<i>Coach Driscoll sends in a play,</i>

1653
01:24:50,697 --> 01:24:52,791
<i>but there's another steal.</i>

1654
01:24:54,371 --> 01:24:57,076
<i>And another quick two
for Dellaplane.</i>

1655
01:24:57,107 --> 01:24:58,702
<i>Coronets' fans are out in force here.</i>

1656
01:24:58,728 --> 01:25:01,039
<i>And I think,
the Cyclones are rattled.</i>

1657
01:25:01,064 --> 01:25:02,101
<i>They're not used to it.</i>

1658
01:25:02,126 --> 01:25:04,241
<i>This hornet Coronets defense
has got the Cyclones...</i>

1659
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:06,245
<i>tied up a knot of frustration.</i>

1660
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:07,857
Girls, you gotta move the ball.

1661
01:25:07,882 --> 01:25:09,747
You have to work the ball around.

1662
01:25:09,772 --> 01:25:10,909
<i>Just lost focus.</i>

1663
01:25:10,934 --> 01:25:13,173
<i>Having a tough time
running with these big girls...</i>

1664
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:14,695
<i>from the Coronets.</i>

1665
01:25:15,634 --> 01:25:17,427
Come on, move back.

1666
01:25:18,268 --> 01:25:20,769
<i>Coronets are still dominating
with their size and quickness.</i>

1667
01:25:20,794 --> 01:25:22,559
<i>The fact that they've
been here before...</i>

1668
01:25:22,584 --> 01:25:24,779
<i>definitely starting to show
at this point.</i>

1669
01:25:24,804 --> 01:25:28,233
<i>Long down court pass,
and that one is picked off.</i>

1670
01:25:28,272 --> 01:25:30,116
She just cleared out.

1671
01:25:30,164 --> 01:25:31,795
<i>Once the confidence goes,</i>

1672
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:33,243
<i>the shooting can't be far behind.</i>

1673
01:25:33,268 --> 01:25:35,664
<i>Another one clanks off
the rim for Middleton.</i>

1674
01:25:35,696 --> 01:25:38,506
<i>And Dellaplane has the confidence
all going their way.</i>

1675
01:25:38,531 --> 01:25:40,558
<i>The wheels seem to be
coming off of the Cyclones.</i>

1676
01:25:40,583 --> 01:25:43,895
<i>And the Coronets are
outscoring them by nearly 3 to 1.</i>

1677
01:25:44,014 --> 01:25:46,254
<i>28-10, Dellaplane leads.</i>

1678
01:25:46,524 --> 01:25:49,182
<i>Well, this has been
a one-sided half of basketball.</i>

1679
01:25:49,207 --> 01:25:51,064
<i>And the Coronets are
running at all cylinders,</i>

1680
01:25:51,089 --> 01:25:53,416
<i>whereas the Cyclones
are one half away...</i>

1681
01:25:53,441 --> 01:25:56,391
<i>from ending their Cinderella season.</i>

1682
01:26:16,656 --> 01:26:19,883
Well, that was quite a first half.

1683
01:26:29,945 --> 01:26:32,042
Alright, listen up.

1684
01:26:32,346 --> 01:26:34,253
Come on now.

1685
01:26:35,171 --> 01:26:37,987
Everybody knows how good Dellaplane is.

1686
01:26:38,064 --> 01:26:40,123
And they just showed it.

1687
01:26:40,274 --> 01:26:42,054
And right now, maybe,

1688
01:26:42,102 --> 01:26:45,541
nobody out there thinks
you measure up.

1689
01:26:48,334 --> 01:26:49,874
Look.

1690
01:26:49,994 --> 01:26:51,853
History teaches us,

1691
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:54,842
there's no measuring the human heart.

1692
01:26:57,843 --> 01:27:01,193
People are capable of anything
if you have the will.

1693
01:27:02,051 --> 01:27:03,811
You have that will.

1694
01:27:04,038 --> 01:27:05,641
In buckets.

1695
01:27:05,896 --> 01:27:06,958
I've seen it.

1696
01:27:06,983 --> 01:27:08,388
In here.

1697
01:27:08,539 --> 01:27:10,380
I can feel it.

1698
01:27:18,389 --> 01:27:20,605
About last night.

1699
01:27:25,274 --> 01:27:27,840
What I didn't know, till now.

1700
01:27:29,663 --> 01:27:31,759
I didn't want boys.

1701
01:27:32,077 --> 01:27:35,447
It was you who I wanted all along.

1702
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:40,700
No boys could ever do what you have.

1703
01:27:43,056 --> 01:27:45,486
I can't ask any more from you.

1704
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:47,708
No coach could.

1705
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:50,597
Nobody.

1706
01:27:50,669 --> 01:27:52,256
And you'll win tonight because of this,

1707
01:27:52,289 --> 01:27:54,440
because of who you are,
and how special you are.

1708
01:27:54,511 --> 01:27:56,855
How special you are to me.

1709
01:27:58,482 --> 01:28:00,887
You will win tonight for your mamas,

1710
01:28:00,943 --> 01:28:02,912
and your grandmas.

1711
01:28:03,055 --> 01:28:05,159
And your sisters.

1712
01:28:05,677 --> 01:28:07,772
And all girls in Middleton,

1713
01:28:07,828 --> 01:28:10,942
and everywhere else
who never got the chance.

1714
01:28:12,269 --> 01:28:15,013
You will win tonight.

1715
01:28:18,089 --> 01:28:20,545
Because it's meant to be.

1716
01:28:22,412 --> 01:28:23,817
<i>Back to second half action.</i>

1717
01:28:23,849 --> 01:28:25,000
<i>Middleton with the ball.</i>

1718
01:28:25,025 --> 01:28:26,573
<i>Cross-handed to Johnson.</i>

1719
01:28:26,598 --> 01:28:28,811
<i>Oh, she puts it up for two.</i>

1720
01:28:28,836 --> 01:28:29,867
Yes!

1721
01:28:29,892 --> 01:28:32,379
<i>Alright, get the Cyclones.
Stovall brings it up this time.</i>

1722
01:28:32,411 --> 01:28:34,856
<i>She shoots it herself,
and makes it.</i>

1723
01:28:34,881 --> 01:28:36,740
<i>Looks like Middleton
gets a load of energy.</i>

1724
01:28:36,765 --> 01:28:39,236
<i>They start the second half on fire.</i>

1725
01:28:39,261 --> 01:28:40,395
<i>And get the crowd excited.</i>

1726
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:42,149
<i>But, it's got to take more
than a couple of baskets...</i>

1727
01:28:42,174 --> 01:28:43,427
<i>to get them back in this game.</i>

1728
01:28:43,452 --> 01:28:44,633
<i>- There's another one.</i>
- Woo!

1729
01:28:44,658 --> 01:28:47,622
<i>Cyclones seem like to have found
the key to this tough 4-2 defense.</i>

1730
01:28:49,844 --> 01:28:51,682
<i>R.C. is not too happy
with the officiating,</i>

1731
01:28:51,707 --> 01:28:54,421
<i>but his girls are flat being
out-muscled right now.</i>

1732
01:28:54,446 --> 01:28:55,542
<i>Qualls brings it in,</i>

1733
01:28:55,567 --> 01:28:57,711
<i>battles for position underneath.
That's the pass inside.</i>

1734
01:28:57,736 --> 01:28:59,868
<i>Overlander goes over,
knocking Johnson to her back.</i>

1735
01:28:59,893 --> 01:29:01,498
<i>I thought that might have been a foul.</i>

1736
01:29:01,523 --> 01:29:02,737
<i>Fans, if you just join us,</i>

1737
01:29:02,762 --> 01:29:05,282
<i>you're seeing an entirely
different Cyclone team...</i>

1738
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:07,461
<i>than what we saw in the first half.</i>

1739
01:29:07,486 --> 01:29:10,187
<i>This is getting really very
physical game underneath.</i>

1740
01:29:10,212 --> 01:29:12,719
<i>And that might play into
the hands of the farm girls here.</i>

1741
01:29:12,754 --> 01:29:14,666
She's, she's clearing out, Ref.

1742
01:29:14,714 --> 01:29:16,518
She's clearing out with her elbow.

1743
01:29:16,548 --> 01:29:18,089
Come on, Ref, look inside.

1744
01:29:18,114 --> 01:29:20,266
<i>This, uh, this Middleton team's
got some fire in their belly.</i>

1745
01:29:20,291 --> 01:29:22,494
<i>I think, maybe, the Coronets thought
they had it won at half time.</i>

1746
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:24,877
<i>And so did just about
everyone in this arena.</i>

1747
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:26,555
<i>Game's getting very physical.</i>

1748
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:29,154
<i>The Cyclones appear to be
taking most of the punishment.</i>

1749
01:29:29,179 --> 01:29:31,918
<i>Liz Blair at the line.
She looks a little woozy...</i>

1750
01:29:31,943 --> 01:29:34,055
<i>after that last altercation.</i>

1751
01:29:34,169 --> 01:29:35,841
<i>Looks like, uh,
she can't barely stand.</i>

1752
01:29:35,866 --> 01:29:38,391
<i>The Coronets are just
wearing down the Cyclones.</i>

1753
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:41,637
<i>She's got one shot,
and she bangs it in.</i>

1754
01:29:41,671 --> 01:29:43,045
<b>The Cyclones are trying
to make it run here,</b>

1755
01:29:43,079 --> 01:29:44,775
<i>but the Coronets are
still holding them at bay.</i>

1756
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,737
<i>Tammy Shaw into Henley,
Henley over to Marvella Qualls...</i>

1757
01:29:47,762 --> 01:29:50,571
<i>who puts it up for another two.</i>

1758
01:29:50,596 --> 01:29:52,415
<i>That play run to perfection,</i>

1759
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:55,831
<i>and, uh, it's this that
we get a battle here, friends.</i>

1760
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:57,761
<i>The Cyclones have
managed to pull closer.</i>

1761
01:29:57,786 --> 01:30:00,264
<i>Center, Pat Thompson,
is still on the bench with a bad leg.</i>

1762
01:30:00,289 --> 01:30:02,138
<i>They can sure use her size inside.</i>

1763
01:30:02,163 --> 01:30:04,187
<i>Cyclones are still giving up
a good six inches...</i>

1764
01:30:04,212 --> 01:30:05,991
<i>at Center and Forward.</i>

1765
01:30:06,079 --> 01:30:08,198
Coach, they're too big.
They grind us down.

1766
01:30:08,223 --> 01:30:09,443
Both their forwards,
I can beat them.

1767
01:30:09,468 --> 01:30:11,421
- Put me in and let me run.
- Ruth, go in for Portia.

1768
01:30:11,446 --> 01:30:13,877
You double up on the center.
You get us back in this game.

1769
01:30:13,902 --> 01:30:16,535
With no more than 4 or 5
minutes left in the game,

1770
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,982
we're 4 down, 5 down,
they will not throw pad now.

1771
01:30:19,007 --> 01:30:20,665
I'm ready now.
Dad brought two tests.

1772
01:30:20,690 --> 01:30:22,286
- I feel fine, Coach.
- No.

1773
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,071
Not yet.

1774
01:30:24,668 --> 01:30:27,466
<i>Cyclones driven away as we come
to the end of third quarter, and...</i>

1775
01:30:27,491 --> 01:30:28,696
<i>Coronets are still up by 12.</i>

1776
01:30:28,721 --> 01:30:30,744
<i>But, Middleton's gonna make a run.
That's their signature.</i>

1777
01:30:30,769 --> 01:30:32,345
<i>They got precious little time to do it.</i>

1778
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:33,373
<i>That's not gonna help.</i>

1779
01:30:33,398 --> 01:30:35,222
<i>Missed shot, pulled out by Dellaplane.</i>

1780
01:30:35,247 --> 01:30:36,940
<i>They take it to trip
to the home for two.</i>

1781
01:30:36,965 --> 01:30:38,770
Come on, girls, you know this.

1782
01:30:38,795 --> 01:30:41,671
<i>This Tammy Shaw of the Coronets
is just unstoppable.</i>

1783
01:30:41,711 --> 01:30:44,912
<i>And she splits the defense
for another two points.</i>

1784
01:30:45,476 --> 01:30:46,924
<i>Coming down the last few minutes.</i>

1785
01:30:46,949 --> 01:30:48,797
<i>Here's the Oklahoma girls state finals.</i>

1786
01:30:48,822 --> 01:30:51,091
<i>This has been a see-saw
battle in the second half.</i>

1787
01:30:51,117 --> 01:30:53,152
<i>Much better game than
anyone would have expected...</i>

1788
01:30:53,177 --> 01:30:55,421
<i>out of this girls team
from the farmland.</i>

1789
01:30:55,446 --> 01:30:58,759
<i>Uh, vastly different styles
between these two coaches,</i>

1790
01:30:58,882 --> 01:31:00,858
<i>Pruitt and Driscoll.</i>

1791
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:01,999
<i>Shaw climbing to the hole.</i>

1792
01:31:10,356 --> 01:31:11,785
Come on.

1793
01:31:11,864 --> 01:31:12,919
Alright.

1794
01:31:12,967 --> 01:31:14,181
Half shuffle,

1795
01:31:14,213 --> 01:31:16,239
full press, over for Liz.

1796
01:31:16,264 --> 01:31:19,457
<i>Pat Thompson has been
the Cyclones' go-to girl all season.</i>

1797
01:31:19,482 --> 01:31:22,183
<i>Pat Thompson!</i>

1798
01:31:22,214 --> 01:31:24,056
<i>Not expected to play today.</i>

1799
01:31:24,096 --> 01:31:27,453
<i>But with the game on the line,
Coach wants to test that play.</i>

1800
01:31:27,492 --> 01:31:29,148
<i>They line up for the free throw.</i>

1801
01:31:29,173 --> 01:31:30,680
<i>Now, I could call that the other way.</i>

1802
01:31:30,705 --> 01:31:32,718
<i>That definitely looks like a charge to me.</i>

1803
01:31:32,743 --> 01:31:34,068
<i>But, they call for block.</i>

1804
01:31:34,093 --> 01:31:36,426
<i>And Dellaplane is at the line.</i>

1805
01:31:36,874 --> 01:31:38,234
<i>First one rattles out.</i>

1806
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:39,279
<i>Oh, my goodness!</i>

1807
01:31:39,304 --> 01:31:42,641
<i>Maybe, she's feeling a little bit
guilty about getting that free call.</i>

1808
01:31:42,721 --> 01:31:44,975
<i>This is the girl you want on the line?</i>

1809
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,344
<i>With the game on the line.</i>

1810
01:31:46,369 --> 01:31:48,415
<i>The district scoring champ puts it out.</i>

1811
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:49,860
<i>And another good one.</i>

1812
01:31:49,885 --> 01:31:51,599
<i>Oh, that hurts, for the Cyclones.</i>

1813
01:31:51,624 --> 01:31:53,638
<i>Two minutes.
All over right handside.</i>

1814
01:31:53,701 --> 01:31:55,245
<i>Coach calls in a play,</i>

1815
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:57,308
<i>stifled by the Coronets' defense,</i>

1816
01:31:57,349 --> 01:31:59,063
<i>Time running out the Cyclones.</i>

1817
01:31:59,098 --> 01:32:01,764
<i>Grove trying to get it
down low to Thompson.</i>

1818
01:32:01,867 --> 01:32:03,653
<i>She puts it up and it's good.</i>

1819
01:32:03,678 --> 01:32:05,987
<i>Her first two points of the contest.</i>

1820
01:32:06,031 --> 01:32:08,046
<i>Defense has really
picked up on fullback.</i>

1821
01:32:08,071 --> 01:32:10,096
<i>Dellaplane puts up a shot, but misses.</i>

1822
01:32:10,121 --> 01:32:12,335
<i>Grove took off,
freaked out a little bit.</i>

1823
01:32:12,835 --> 01:32:14,843
<i>Looks like Grove is trying to go solo...</i>

1824
01:32:14,868 --> 01:32:17,053
<i>all the way down the court, and...</i>

1825
01:32:17,173 --> 01:32:19,522
<i>she puts it up for two.</i>

1826
01:32:19,684 --> 01:32:21,534
<i>Now only four minutes to play,</i>

1827
01:32:21,565 --> 01:32:23,438
<i>Coronets up by just six.</i>

1828
01:32:23,463 --> 01:32:25,779
<i>Completely intensity
building in this arena.</i>

1829
01:32:25,805 --> 01:32:27,420
<i>And Shaw brings the ball up.</i>

1830
01:32:28,603 --> 01:32:31,167
<i>Middleton needs a stop here.</i>

1831
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:33,791
<i>Shaw has down low to Lockett.</i>

1832
01:32:33,831 --> 01:32:36,102
<i>She drives to the hole,
and puts it up.</i>

1833
01:32:36,127 --> 01:32:38,023
<i>It's good for two.</i>

1834
01:32:38,472 --> 01:32:41,028
<i>And Johnson brings
the ball in for Middleton.</i>

1835
01:32:41,060 --> 01:32:42,108
<i>To Grove.</i>

1836
01:32:42,133 --> 01:32:45,109
<i>Just over three and a half to go,
Cyclones now down by eight.</i>

1837
01:32:45,208 --> 01:32:48,300
<i>Grove brings the ball up
for Middleton.</i>

1838
01:32:49,822 --> 01:32:51,022
<i>No, no. Top, top.</i>

1839
01:32:51,047 --> 01:32:52,364
Come on, get the ball.

1840
01:32:52,389 --> 01:32:53,872
<i>Watch for somebody inside.</i>

1841
01:32:53,897 --> 01:32:55,983
- Good.
<i>- It's a pass over to left-hand side.</i>

1842
01:32:56,018 --> 01:32:57,581
<i>Hard into Johnson.</i>

1843
01:32:57,605 --> 01:33:01,313
<i>Give and go, back to Thompson
who puts it up for good two.</i>

1844
01:33:03,772 --> 01:33:06,534
<i>And this game is going down to the wire.</i>

1845
01:33:06,576 --> 01:33:09,656
<i>Dellaplane's guard, Shaw,
running away from the Cyclone defense,</i>

1846
01:33:09,696 --> 01:33:11,473
<i>just like she did all night long.</i>

1847
01:33:11,498 --> 01:33:13,505
<i>She's gonna try to get it
inside over the right,</i>

1848
01:33:13,529 --> 01:33:15,164
<i>which she dominated inside.</i>

1849
01:33:15,208 --> 01:33:18,049
<i>Meanwhile, Thompson, what a way
to play under this Middleton team!</i>

1850
01:33:18,074 --> 01:33:20,235
<i>And she's doing a darn good job.</i>

1851
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:22,579
<i>Looking inside.
Pass to the right-hand side.</i>

1852
01:33:22,604 --> 01:33:25,640
<i>Henley to Qualls
who puts it up for two.</i>

1853
01:33:25,696 --> 01:33:26,989
<i>Middleton brings the ball up.</i>

1854
01:33:27,014 --> 01:33:28,236
<i>Again down by six.</i>

1855
01:33:28,275 --> 01:33:30,029
<i>Just over a minute forty to play.</i>

1856
01:33:30,054 --> 01:33:32,308
<i>And the chess man
takes the team to see.</i>

1857
01:33:32,351 --> 01:33:34,430
<i>Evenly matched coaches continues.</i>

1858
01:33:34,489 --> 01:33:37,561
<i>Number 35, Crossett brings
the ball up for Middleton.</i>

1859
01:33:37,757 --> 01:33:39,582
<i>Pass to the right-hand side.</i>

1860
01:33:39,622 --> 01:33:41,796
<i>Nothing to do over there
but Coronets defense.</i>

1861
01:33:41,836 --> 01:33:43,225
<i>Thompson at the top of the key.</i>

1862
01:33:43,264 --> 01:33:45,581
<i>Thompson tries to make it.
Yes!</i>

1863
01:33:45,619 --> 01:33:46,984
<i>This game is not over yet.</i>

1864
01:33:47,009 --> 01:33:50,706
<i>Just four points apart with
a minute twenty-six to go.</i>

1865
01:33:51,570 --> 01:33:52,832
<i>Coronets bring it in.</i>

1866
01:33:52,872 --> 01:33:54,594
<i>And Middleton goes to a press.</i>

1867
01:33:54,698 --> 01:33:55,968
<i>She's got no place to go.</i>

1868
01:33:56,001 --> 01:34:00,345
<i>And pass and it's stolen
by Thompson who takes it in for two.</i>

1869
01:34:00,412 --> 01:34:03,448
<i>Whatever was wrong with
that ankle seems to be fine now.</i>

1870
01:34:03,473 --> 01:34:05,740
<i>A minute fifteen to go
and it's a two-point game.</i>

1871
01:34:05,765 --> 01:34:07,898
<i>Who to bucket?
Coronets bring the ball up.</i>

1872
01:34:07,926 --> 01:34:09,489
<i>Johnson holding her own inside.</i>

1873
01:34:09,514 --> 01:34:12,330
<i>But all-state center, Overlander,
gets very rough in there.</i>

1874
01:34:12,355 --> 01:34:15,038
<i>Lots of banging down in the paint.</i>

1875
01:34:15,407 --> 01:34:16,780
<i>Pass right side into the paint.</i>

1876
01:34:16,805 --> 01:34:17,902
<i>And it's stolen!</i>

1877
01:34:17,927 --> 01:34:20,124
<i>She presses it over to Thompson.</i>

1878
01:34:20,175 --> 01:34:21,516
<i>Picked up by Middleton.</i>

1879
01:34:21,552 --> 01:34:24,314
<i>A pass to midcourt at the top of the key.</i>

1880
01:34:24,339 --> 01:34:26,426
Over looking on the left-hand side.

1881
01:34:26,456 --> 01:34:27,535
<i>Over to Barney.</i>

1882
01:34:27,567 --> 01:34:29,189
<i>12-pointer on the left-hand side.</i>

1883
01:34:29,214 --> 01:34:30,704
- Yeah!
<i>- It's good.</i>

1884
01:34:30,729 --> 01:34:32,798
<i>Twenty-three seconds left in the game.</i>

1885
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:34,517
<i>Middleton has tied it up.</i>

1886
01:34:34,547 --> 01:34:35,756
<i>Is this something?</i>

1887
01:34:35,790 --> 01:34:37,849
<i>I can't even hear myself talk in here.</i>

1888
01:34:37,874 --> 01:34:39,027
<i>Dellaplane with the ball.</i>

1889
01:34:39,052 --> 01:34:40,877
<i>Under twenty, and Shaw brings it up.</i>

1890
01:34:40,927 --> 01:34:43,515
<i>Now it's the Coronets time
to play a little snowball...</i>

1891
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:45,127
<i>and go for the last shot.</i>

1892
01:34:45,152 --> 01:34:47,698
<i>The worst they can do
at this point is a tie.</i>

1893
01:34:47,723 --> 01:34:49,353
<i>Shaw and Overlander, right side.</i>

1894
01:34:49,378 --> 01:34:50,417
<i>Back on to Shaw.</i>

1895
01:34:50,442 --> 01:34:52,499
<i>Over to the left inside the paint.</i>

1896
01:34:52,524 --> 01:34:54,792
<i>Sixteen seconds. Fifteen.</i>

1897
01:34:54,826 --> 01:34:56,326
Look out!

1898
01:34:56,353 --> 01:34:58,147
<i>Overlander is dominating here all game.</i>

1899
01:34:58,172 --> 01:35:00,609
<i>Goes up for the shot and
it's blocked by Thompson!</i>

1900
01:35:00,634 --> 01:35:02,118
<i>Ball goes underneath into the treble.</i>

1901
01:35:02,153 --> 01:35:03,971
<i>Ten seconds.
Nine seconds.</i>

1902
01:35:03,996 --> 01:35:06,782
<i>And Johnson comes out with
a football-pass down to midcourt.</i>

1903
01:35:06,832 --> 01:35:08,626
<i>Six seconds.
Thompson's got it.</i>

1904
01:35:08,651 --> 01:35:10,470
<i>Time for one shot, but oh!</i>

1905
01:35:10,502 --> 01:35:13,287
Ow, it looks like she's going down
that might put her right ankle.

1906
01:35:13,338 --> 01:35:14,767
<i>Four seconds. Well fans...</i>

1907
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:17,343
<i>Looks like we're headed to overtime.</i>

1908
01:35:17,425 --> 01:35:19,259
<i>Thompson puts up a play from mid-court.</i>

1909
01:35:19,283 --> 01:35:20,671
<i>It's good!</i>

1910
01:35:20,696 --> 01:35:23,164
<i>It's good! Unbelievable!</i>

1911
01:35:23,216 --> 01:35:24,709
<i>Middleton wins!</i>

1912
01:35:24,735 --> 01:35:27,290
<i>David has taken down Goliath.</i>

1913
01:35:27,315 --> 01:35:31,536
<i>Middleton puts up last one by two
to take the state title.</i>

1914
01:35:31,561 --> 01:35:33,208
<i>Who would ever believe it?</i>

1915
01:35:33,233 --> 01:35:35,566
<i>I'll tell you who.
Middleton believed it.</i>

1916
01:35:35,591 --> 01:35:37,259
<i>These kids never said that.</i>

1917
01:35:37,284 --> 01:35:38,910
<i>And you better believe it.</i>

1918
01:35:40,911 --> 01:35:42,878
You made that shot!

1919
01:35:42,918 --> 01:35:44,903
You made that shot!

1920
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:56,397
Good job!

1921
01:35:56,786 --> 01:35:59,143
We did it, Danny, we did it.

1922
01:35:59,904 --> 01:36:01,341
Thank you so much.

1923
01:36:07,491 --> 01:36:09,602
- I miss you.
- Oh.

1924
01:36:15,587 --> 01:36:17,325
Hey, Mama, we did it.

1925
01:36:17,357 --> 01:36:18,738
Monday morning,

1926
01:36:18,763 --> 01:36:23,369
I expect your resignation in writing,
both as coach and history teacher.

1927
01:36:23,516 --> 01:36:25,313
For what?

1928
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:28,966
You use a married girl
without permission,

1929
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:31,256
which is against board policy,

1930
01:36:31,281 --> 01:36:33,436
leaving me absolutely no alternative.

1931
01:36:33,461 --> 01:36:34,507
Bullshit!

1932
01:36:34,532 --> 01:36:37,249
- What these girls want--
- Monday morning, sir,

1933
01:36:37,274 --> 01:36:40,862
Mr. Spainhower is going
to write four letters.

1934
01:36:40,888 --> 01:36:42,451
And those letters are gonna say,

1935
01:36:42,476 --> 01:36:45,467
Middleton High School is gonna
forfeit three games,

1936
01:36:45,492 --> 01:36:49,535
including tonight's state championship!

1937
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:52,412
You can't do that.

1938
01:36:52,461 --> 01:36:54,429
 I can't do that?

1939
01:36:55,442 --> 01:36:57,362
Watch me.

1940
01:37:08,744 --> 01:37:10,664
Okay. Let's...

1941
01:37:33,799 --> 01:37:35,717
Clay?

1942
01:37:36,621 --> 01:37:39,029
Phone, honey.

1943
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:42,783
Clay?

1944
01:37:54,168 --> 01:37:56,696
- Hey, Coach.
- Hey, John.

1945
01:37:58,258 --> 01:37:59,465
Hey, ah-ah-ah, now,

1946
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:01,862
that better not be
what I think it is.

1947
01:38:01,901 --> 01:38:03,504
It's the only way.

1948
01:38:03,574 --> 01:38:06,111
What he wants is,
is me leaving.

1949
01:38:06,136 --> 01:38:07,410
If I give him this,

1950
01:38:07,434 --> 01:38:09,966
maybe, he'll let the girls
keep the championship.

1951
01:38:10,006 --> 01:38:11,810
Never happen.

1952
01:38:12,224 --> 01:38:13,494
It's my decision.

1953
01:38:13,519 --> 01:38:15,003
Oh, you think so?

1954
01:38:15,051 --> 01:38:16,391
I don't.

1955
01:38:16,416 --> 01:38:19,137
Old law school buddy of mine works
at the Attorney General's office,

1956
01:38:19,162 --> 01:38:21,498
and I was on the phone
with him all night long.

1957
01:38:21,542 --> 01:38:23,536
A big basketball fan.

1958
01:38:23,603 --> 01:38:28,777
Nobody is taking the state championship
away from our girls or this town.

1959
01:38:28,802 --> 01:38:30,243
- Nobody.
- No.

1960
01:38:30,277 --> 01:38:32,117
- Nobody.
- Right, nobody!

1961
01:38:35,637 --> 01:38:38,984
I'd just love to see him fight this,
and end up in the New York Times.

1962
01:38:39,009 --> 01:38:46,646
Pride!

1963
01:39:07,308 --> 01:39:08,949
Mr. Spainhower,

1964
01:39:08,974 --> 01:39:12,838
Miss Rogers, you are witness
to this civil disobedience...

1965
01:39:12,863 --> 01:39:15,061
Mr. Driscoll has incited...

1966
01:39:15,086 --> 01:39:18,602
to intimidate you and the school board.

1967
01:39:18,627 --> 01:39:20,127
- Pride! Pride! Pride!
- Enough!

1968
01:39:20,152 --> 01:39:21,546
Enough!

1969
01:39:22,893 --> 01:39:24,663
Enough.

1970
01:39:26,302 --> 01:39:29,599
You get back to your classroom.

1971
01:39:30,509 --> 01:39:33,481
What do you think this is?
California?

1972
01:39:33,714 --> 01:39:35,788
Miss Rogers, would you be
good enough to call the station,

1973
01:39:35,813 --> 01:39:37,649
check and be sure Sheriff
Blessingame is on...

1974
01:39:37,674 --> 01:39:40,378
- the way.
-  I don't need a damn sheriff.

1975
01:39:41,105 --> 01:39:43,267
You made it real easy, Mr. Driscoll.

1976
01:39:43,292 --> 01:39:44,657
You're fired.

1977
01:39:44,690 --> 01:39:46,206
No, he isn't.

1978
01:39:46,262 --> 01:39:48,478
You have no authority
over Mr. Driscoll here.

1979
01:39:48,503 --> 01:39:49,998
He did nothing wrong.

1980
01:39:50,038 --> 01:39:53,252
Frances Bonner Price is
and always was eligible.

1981
01:39:53,277 --> 01:39:54,244
Says who?

1982
01:39:54,269 --> 01:39:56,292
Says the Attorney General
of the State of Oklahoma.

1983
01:39:56,317 --> 01:39:58,352
Whose granddaddy caddied
for my granddaddy.

1984
01:39:58,377 --> 01:40:01,264
You are way out of your depth.

1985
01:40:01,297 --> 01:40:02,930
Hold on now.

1986
01:40:02,955 --> 01:40:05,823
I thought you said,
we were all in this together.

1987
01:40:05,879 --> 01:40:07,364
Those are your words.

1988
01:40:07,389 --> 01:40:09,216
That Sunday in church,

1989
01:40:09,256 --> 01:40:10,963
when you tried to humiliate me...

1990
01:40:10,988 --> 01:40:13,527
in front of the entire congregation.

1991
01:40:17,232 --> 01:40:20,796
I came out to your ranch and
I asked you if you needed any help.

1992
01:40:20,875 --> 01:40:23,375
You never asked if I did.

1993
01:40:26,202 --> 01:40:28,571
He said girls don't draw.

1994
01:40:28,858 --> 01:40:30,643
Thousand showed up.

1995
01:40:30,693 --> 01:40:32,550
You didn't believe
when we went all the way,

1996
01:40:32,575 --> 01:40:34,987
and we won state champs.

1997
01:40:35,292 --> 01:40:36,483
And you weren't part of it.

1998
01:40:36,508 --> 01:40:39,023
That's why you want
to take this away from us.

1999
01:40:39,102 --> 01:40:41,194
This is a great town.

2000
01:40:41,479 --> 01:40:43,464
These are great people.

2001
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:45,792
They taught me a lot.

2002
01:40:47,444 --> 01:40:49,513
We need each other.

2003
01:40:50,021 --> 01:40:51,394
But you,

2004
01:40:51,436 --> 01:40:53,660
you don't need anybody.

2005
01:40:54,216 --> 01:40:56,902
And the pity is, Ellis...

2006
01:40:58,687 --> 01:41:00,991
I feel sorry for you.

2007
01:41:01,822 --> 01:41:03,449
All of you,

2008
01:41:03,515 --> 01:41:07,031
my bank holds paper on your homes,

2009
01:41:07,056 --> 01:41:08,423
your farms,

2010
01:41:08,463 --> 01:41:10,002
- on your tractor.
- Hey.

2011
01:41:10,027 --> 01:41:12,401
Who is threatening who now?

2012
01:41:12,888 --> 01:41:15,518
Whatever it is that
you think you're playing,

2013
01:41:15,566 --> 01:41:17,200
there's not enough firepower...

2014
01:41:17,225 --> 01:41:18,764
- all of you can bunch.
- Coach!

2015
01:41:18,789 --> 01:41:20,704
Mr. Brawley.

2016
01:41:21,378 --> 01:41:22,688
Where the hell have you been?

2017
01:41:22,713 --> 01:41:24,755
I've had civil disobedience here since--

2018
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:27,179
Mr. Brawley, you're hereby enjoined...

2019
01:41:27,205 --> 01:41:29,490
from forfeiting the state championship.

2020
01:41:29,515 --> 01:41:31,388
Writs of mandamus...

2021
01:41:31,413 --> 01:41:34,190
signed by the district judge.

2022
01:41:36,976 --> 01:41:38,532
Well.

2023
01:41:38,852 --> 01:41:40,392
We'll see.

2024
01:41:40,605 --> 01:41:42,607
Who knows which judge?

2025
01:41:42,632 --> 01:41:45,452
Oh, I don't think you need
to worry about judges.

2026
01:41:45,508 --> 01:41:48,535
These are from
the Attorney General's office.

2027
01:41:48,637 --> 01:41:51,934
Two separate opinions.

2028
01:41:55,455 --> 01:41:57,305
You know what?

2029
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:02,286
For once in your life, Ellis Brawley,

Ladies and gentlemen,

2068
01:44:40,470 --> 01:44:42,414
we're doing something
a little different during this take.

2069
01:44:42,439 --> 01:44:43,443
- Jim.
- Yeah.

2070
01:44:43,468 --> 01:44:46,533
- Would you take this seat right here?
- Coming.

2071
01:44:46,836 --> 01:44:48,750
Right here.
Just sit right here.

2072
01:44:48,776 --> 01:44:50,860
Jorene, sit right there.

2073
01:44:51,004 --> 01:44:55,520
And I think, your uh, your basketball girls
have something to present to you.

2074
01:44:56,647 --> 01:44:59,385
We're the original team gym team of...

2075
01:44:59,410 --> 01:45:00,433
My goodness.

2076
01:45:00,458 --> 01:45:03,774
Jim Keith, and he is
a legend in our state.

2077
01:45:03,921 --> 01:45:06,248
And we want to thank all of you,

2078
01:45:06,273 --> 01:45:09,559
particularly our coach,
for letting us relive...

2079
01:45:09,716 --> 01:45:12,809
a magical time in our lives when...

2080
01:45:12,834 --> 01:45:14,715
we were young and...

2081
01:45:14,743 --> 01:45:17,899
and we thought that
anything was possible.

2082
01:45:17,954 --> 01:45:20,313
And it's, it's due to this man, Jim Keith.

2083
01:45:20,338 --> 01:45:22,586
He is a legend in the state of Oklahoma,

2084
01:45:22,625 --> 01:45:25,478
and because of this film,
he is going to be a legend...

2085
01:45:25,509 --> 01:45:28,418
in the world in girls basketball coach.

2086
01:45:28,472 --> 01:45:30,758
Mr. Keith has a birthday this month.

2087
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:32,425
- Oh.
- And...

2088
01:45:32,450 --> 01:45:35,004
Coach, from all of us...

2089
01:45:35,250 --> 01:45:38,348
- We love you.
- We love you.

2090
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:08,240
We love you.
