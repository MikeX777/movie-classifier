10
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,970
Good morning, everybody.
May I have your attention, please?

11
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:52,370
We are now flying at an altitude
of 7,000 ft. with an air speed of 200 mph.

12
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,570
We are scheduled to reach Cairo at 7:50 PM.

13
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,690
Breakfast will be served momentarily.
You may order <i>a la carte</i>.

14
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,680
This is your hostess, Ms. Gamage Dean.

15
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,390
Oh, Gamage, why won't you quit
clowning around?

16
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,160
All right, Carl, you may have your orders.
What'll you have for breakfast?

17
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,000
Some as yours, dear girl:
a double Alka-Seltzer.

18
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,650
I know just how you feel. What about
our distinguished society columnist?

19
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,390
Hey, Doodles, what do you usually take
the morning after?

20
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,390
Do you think you could find me
a little spot of spirits?

21
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,920
I'll take it up to our pilot.

22
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,420
That girl will never change.

23
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,320
Dick, is it okay if I slip Doodles a drink?

24
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,360
No dice. Try to settle for a couple
of Aspirins. Diana knows where they are.

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,890
Oh, and have her bring me a cup
of black coffee on a double, will ya?

26
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,610
Diana? Your dream boy would like
a cup of black coffee. On the double.

27
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,090
-- Is she still burning?
-- Apparently.

28
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,610
Gamage, will you get me some more ice?

29
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,340
Hey, Carl. Take a look of what Doodles
has to say about your daughter's wedding.

30
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,460
Just 36 hours ago Dick Penrod,
well-known American sportsman,

31
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,730
flew your correspondent
to the party events to Nairobi,

32
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,430
where we attended the wedding of Prince
Ego Orlando to the American heiress,
Ms. Margaret Cameron.

33
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,780
After seeing the bride and groom up on
their honeymoon, we boarded Dick's plane,

34
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,580
and are now returning
to the French Riviera via Cairo and Rome.

35
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,380
If you want to be honest, you can add
that it would probably take
the wedding party a week to recover.

36
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,700
Come on, Carl, flap out of it. Remember,
you're now the father in law
of a real life prince!

37
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,640
Yeah, but all he's got it's a title.

38
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,820
That's not what I heard.

39
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,270
Where do you keep the aspirins?

40
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,270
Here you are.

41
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,460
You want me to take Dick's coffee?

42
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,310
No, I'll do it.

43
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,790
Why don't you two kiss and make up?

44
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,250
If you had to go through what
I go through all the time,
you'd get a little tired of it, too.

45
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,510
You don't have to tell me,
I had 4 husbands, remember?

46
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,930
We're now flying to Africa to see
a spoiled little rich girl marry
some broken down prince, we're...

47
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,140
...dashing up to Monte Carlo to try
the new system for beating roulette.

48
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,680
It's crazy.

49
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,630
Did you ever know an interesting man
who wasn't a little crazy?

50
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,570
Just like women. You never knew
a real sharp girl with both feet
on the ground, did you?

51
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,910
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.

52
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,290
Hey! How about that coffee?

53
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,290
I'm coming.

54
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,690
Watch the sausages, will you?

55
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,460
Here, Dick.

56
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,460
How long can you take?

57
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,110
-- Sorry.
-- Sit down, I wanna talk to you.

58
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,580
Well?

59
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,700
Why don't you get off this kick?

60
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,920
Why don't you just fly the plane,
we'll discuss it later.

61
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,200
We'll discuss it right now!
What's the matter with you?

62
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,040
Don't you ever like to have any fun?

63
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,540
I'm just bored to death with flying.

64
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,160
I'm not a wife, I'm a stewardess!

65
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
I don't want to argue, Dick,
really I don't.

66
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,340
Okay, but you knew when you married me
that flying was my hobby.

67
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,260
I did not! You didn't even
own a plane then.

68
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,890
If you remember, you were fooling around
with racing cars!

69
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,670
All right, so what? Now I like airplanes.

70
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,080
And I've got news for you:
when we get home, I'm gonna get a new one,
and it's gonna be a jet!

71
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,610
Why don't you get a guided missile,
then you can spend your weekends
on the Moon!

72
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,610
That's not a bad idea.

73
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,520
Maybe it's not a bad idea if you and me
were to separate, either.

74
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,420
That's okay with me.

75
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,440
Fasten your safety belts.
We're going down to have a close look
at the jungle.

76
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,160
Dick, just because you can't control
your temper, there's no need to take it
out on everyone else.

77
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,750
I'm not taking anything out on anybody.

78
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,170
Why don't you relax?
Just trying to show you all the animals.

79
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,170
Go look out of the window.

80
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,300
Gamage, make him happy and see
what's out there, will you?

81
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,530
Look at all those ponies!

82
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,580
When ponies wear stripes,
they'd only call them zebras.

83
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,460
Well, what do you know?

84
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:44,900
Doodles, come here! There's a whole flock
of mama elephants with their babies!

85
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,440
Never did like going to the zoo, anyway.

86
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,730
Diana, come here, quick!

87
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,020
Haven't you seen enough of those animals?

88
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,010
Oh, you.

89
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,410
Why you wake me, Cheta?

90
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,950
Opar drums say sky bird come.

91
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,430
Hey! Look at those hippos down there!

92
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,360
Dick, look out! Your plane's flying
to a lot of flamingos!

93
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,060
Go back and sit down!
Put on your safety belt!

94
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,700
Fasten the safety belts,
they're coming here.

95
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,620
What's that noise? What's happening?

96
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,430
Flamingos. We hit a migration.

97
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,900
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

98
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:01,040
MSMSX4DM calling! MSMSX4DM calling!

99
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,520
We're making a crash landing!
We're making a...

100
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,920
Come, Cheta!

101
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,220
Careful how you move, everybody.

102
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,520
We're on the edge of nothing.

103
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,780
I help you.

104
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,400
Hurry. But move like cat.
Sky bird going to fall.

105
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,280
No look down. Make it sick.

106
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,520
Feet like so.

107
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,360
-- Come on, now!
-- Oh, no!

108
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,530
Cheta good girl. Get down, Cheta!

109
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,010
Cheta! Quick!

110
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,580
That was $3,500 worth.

111
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,900
Come on way, Dick.

112
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,090
We had a lot of fun in it, though.

113
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,370
I know.

114
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,360
Do you realize we might all have been
down there, if it hadn't been for him?

115
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,610
Yeah, wasn't he wonderful?

116
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,490
Hey, where's he?

117
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,580
Right there a minute ago.

118
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,410
Any idea where we are, Dick?

119
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,270
At least a 100 miles from the coast.

120
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,910
Then if we can't get someone to help us,
we're in a real trouble.

121
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,190
Yeah, that's about it.

122
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,770
That man might be able to get us
out of here if we can find him.

123
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,980
I knew it was too good to be true.

124
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,300
There's some sort of passway.
Maybe he went down there.

125
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,180
Well, this is one of the stories
I'm afraid I'll never be given credit to.

126
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,180
Diana!

127
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,620
Diana!

128
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,620
Where's Diana?

129
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,980
Met the Opar men. They take girl.

130
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,890
Opar men? What are they?

131
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,720
Bad jungle tribe.

132
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,490
Will they kill her?

133
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,530
They take her to chief.
Make sacrifice to gods.

134
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,220
You wait here by waterfall.

135
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,560
What are they saying?

136
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:23,130
White people fall from sky bird.
Head canyon of great waters.

137
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,800
This one take, then Tarzan come.
Strong like elephant, quick like leopard.

138
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,020
How many white people?

139
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,360
That much men.

140
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,000
That much women.

141
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,370
One take.

142
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,140
4 more whites?

143
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,550
Ogonoore be happy.
5 whites great sacrifice.

144
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,930
Have guns?

145
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,930
Guns?

146
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,840
No guns.

147
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,210
You go now. I keep girl.

148
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,360
Why not we take girl?

149
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:57,880
White men brave, fight for a woman.
Better they think Hawkins good friend,
save girl. Go now!

150
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,060
You're all right?

151
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,670
Those men... savages...
I remember that I was fighting them.

152
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,210
One shot from this saved you.

153
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,530
I'm Tusker Hawkins.

154
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,380
I'm Diana Penrod.

155
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,090
I heard the plane crash.
Are you the only survivor?

156
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,140
No. We're all saved. There're 5 of us.

157
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,740
Ughm. That's gonna be quite some safari.

158
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,740
Yes.

159
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,260
It was all supposed to happen by air.

160
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,800
-- Can you manage it?
-- Yeah.

161
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,850
We'd better get back to your friends.
They may be in trouble, too.

162
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,130
Where you take girl?

163
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,610
Who are you?

164
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,490
This is the man who rescued us
from the plane.

165
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,320
Uh.

166
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,870
You're Tarzan, aren't you?

167
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:50,800
Yes.

168
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:55,130
I was afraid the savages'd killed you.
Oh, this is Mr. Hawkins.

169
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,160
I hear your name many times in jungle.

170
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:03,200
I don't doubt it. I've made
a lot of trips through this territory
over a period of years.

171
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,450
How you get girl away from Opar men?

172
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,940
With that.

173
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,700
Where your native boys?

174
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,120
They quit me. They were afraid to go back
through Opar country.

175
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,780
Why you not afraid to go alone?

176
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,360
Those savages don't bother me
just as long as I have this with me.

177
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,020
Please take me to my friends.
They're back there with no protection.

178
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,460
You know waterfall by bending river?

179
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,980
Yes, not far from here.

180
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,970
Her friends wait for her there.
You take girl to them and keep safe.

181
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,570
-- Aren't you coming with us?
-- No, I come later.

182
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,400
First I go to sky bird and get things
you and friends need to make camp.

183
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,010
You go now.

184
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,100
Come on.

185
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,450
Cheta!

186
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,690
Leave bottle, Cheta. Not good.

187
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,810
Come, Cheta. Leave bottle!

188
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,390
Go, Cheta!

189
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,070
Drop it! Dumba, drop it!

190
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,660
Come on, Dumba. Drop it.

191
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,560
You stay. Not follow. Stay!

192
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,960
I wish Tarzan would get back
with our belongings.

193
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,910
Diana! Quit wandering around
and get back here by the fire!

194
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,530
Are you sure that Tarzan guy
is coming back?

195
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:57,630
Your guess is as good as mine.
I'd heard of him, but never saw him
before today.

196
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,740
Will you two sit down and stay put?

197
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:05,550
I told Nairobi we were in trouble,
but we crashed before they acknowledged
my signal.

198
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,380
And if they'd received it, then
they started looking for us at once.

199
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,370
That way we could expect
the search plane by morning.

200
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,160
I don't want to discourage you,
but you're likely to be here
a lot longer than that.

201
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,210
You were a way off the usual air routes.

202
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,680
What do you suggest then?

203
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,920
There's only one thing to do. I'm heading
for the coast, come along with me.
We leave before dawn.

204
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,010
Do you think you can get us there?

205
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,650
Sure. 3 days, maybe 4.

206
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,190
What's that?

207
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,810
Opar drums.

208
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,450
What are they doing, a war dance?

209
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,030
That's the way they communicate
from one village to another.

210
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,640
You know what they're saying?

211
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,600
No white man can tell you that.

212
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,070
Maybe we're getting
some advance publicity.

213
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,960
You can call it that if you like,
but whatever those savages are saying,
you can be sure it's about us.

214
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,550
And sooner or later
they'll close in on us.

215
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,410
In that case we're better off
staying right here and wait
for that search plane to spot us.

216
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,220
Other people have crashed in Africa
before and been found.

217
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,480
Lots of them, in heaven.

218
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,990
Hawkins knows the country, Dick.
I think we ought to do what he says.

219
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,220
I don't agree. If there is
a search plane out, we gotta give it
the chance to spot us.

220
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,640
Oh, well, if it'll make you feel better,
we'll wait here until 8 o'clock
tomorrow morning.

221
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:27,640
If the plane hasn't shown up by then,
you start up with me.

222
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,120
Good safaries stay close together in camp.

223
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,780
You like to scare us to death.

224
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,010
You might have stopped the bullet
bursting in like that.

225
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,300
When Opar drums talk at night, bad sign.

226
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,470
Did you see any more of those savages?

227
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:49,160
No, but Opar men always try
to take whites for sacrifice.

228
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,380
That's what I've been trying to tell them.
We've gotta get away from here.

229
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,120
Better take blankets and rest.

230
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,260
Is that all you brought? Where's my mink?

231
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,420
The lighter we travel, the better,
if we're making it for the coast.

232
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,160
You take safari to coast?

233
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,120
Well, yes. Unless a plane spots them,
how else will they get there?

234
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,400
You go through gorge by Eagle Mountain?

235
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,190
-- It's the only way.
-- What's wrong with that?

236
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,040
-- Too near Opar village.
-- Oh, I've made the trip several times.

237
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,820
They're on safe hands with me.

238
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,580
No one is safe in Opar country.

239
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:26,210
I don't know why are you trying
to scare everybody.
I can get them throught, all right.

240
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,710
I wonder.

241
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,570
What do you mean?

242
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,810
Hawkins too sure.

243
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,580
You know, Carl, it's quite remarkable.

244
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,530
What is?

245
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,090
It's the first morning for years
I didn't have a hangover.

246
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,890
Oh, really? This is the first time
I'm having a shave in river water.

247
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,680
Those fishes smell good.

248
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:55,390
Hey, Doodles. You're falling apart!

249
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,920
Go on, hang yourself!

250
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,060
Hang on, same for you!

251
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,680
I don't think that monkey is a bit funny.

252
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,390
Who's laughing at the monkey?

253
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,000
Hey, that looks good!

254
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,840
Nobody but Tarzan can catch fish
with his bare hands.

255
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,990
He doesn't tell you about the ones
that got away.

256
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,810
-- I'll see if he's caught any more.
-- Okay.

257
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,040
Put some more wood in the fire, will ya?

258
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,690
Oh, sure.

259
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,870
No, not like that!

260
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,080
Tarzan says it's better this way.

261
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,140
Oh, pardon me.

262
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,110
Hey, Diana, come here!

263
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,120
Watch the fish, will ya?

264
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,730
The latest in building showers.

265
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,560
Quite a waterfall.

266
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,160
Yeah. I like the way it sets ripples.

267
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,090
I wouldn't mind to shower myself.

268
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,340
That'd be one less monkey around here.

269
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,190
This is not very encouraging
if they even didn't get your signal.

270
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,060
I hope you're wrong.

271
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,830
Did you see the way he caught that fish?

272
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,800
Yeah. I bet he does everything well.

273
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,390
Water warm?

274
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,970
No. If water warm, fish no good.

275
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,640
-- Nothing like seeing for yourself.
-- You're not going in that river?

276
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,170
Why not?

277
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,950
-- You swim, too?
-- No, but I could be taught.

278
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,190
Tarzan?

279
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,360
Maybe you'd better come along.

280
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:47,810
That's what I get for learning to cook...

281
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,400
Oh, it's wonderful!

282
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,200
Girl swim good.

283
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:20,530
Thanks. You're not so bad yourself.

284
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,780
Why so much drum talk?
What were they saying?

285
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:34,520
King Ogonoore call all people
come to Opar.

286
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,100
Your drums frighten white.

287
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,650
You bring whites to Opar. Now!

288
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,040
I'll bring as far as Eagle Mountain.

289
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,610
Have warriors ready there
to take whites, not before!

290
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,530
Tell king Ogonoore, Hawkins come.
Tell him, I'll bring Tarzan, too.

291
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,280
That makes 6 whites.

292
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,530
5.

293
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,150
Nogomo knows: keep white girl for Hawkins.

294
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:59,780
You do as I say: no follow.
Go back to Opar.

295
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:29,580
-- Where's Tarzan?
-- Oh, taking a swim.

296
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,030
You're kind of jealous, aren't you?

297
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,280
What do you mean?

298
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:57,490
Tarzan's a pretty good looking fellow.

299
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,230
Oh, that sort of things never bothers me.

300
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,090
What are we waiting for?
Why don't we eat this silly fish?

301
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,030
Diana!

302
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,820
Breakfast is ready!

303
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,000
You mates, huh?

304
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:18,740
Mates? Oh, you mean, Dick's my husband.

305
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,710
-- Yes, I suppose, you'd call...
-- Come on, Diana!

306
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,910
All right, we'll be there!

307
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,970
When mate call, you go quick!

308
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:31,810
Quick?! Not where I'm from, Tarzan.

309
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,970
Way of jungle better.

310
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,570
Cheta hungry.

311
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,560
Maybe you better go. Quick.

312
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,480
Tarzan!

313
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,850
Don't be a fool! You might kill Tarzan!

314
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:40,090
Why do you continue to do
such stupid things?

315
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:44,800
First you wander off by yourself,
and savages get you, then you have to
go and jump in the river.

316
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,060
How'd I know there were
crocodiles in there?

317
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,700
Oh, it wasn't her fault.
Tarzan shouldn't let her go in there
in the first place.

318
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,260
She's old enough to know better.

319
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,930
That was beautiful!

320
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:07,040
You must be in wonderful condition.

321
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,660
Is that how you're keeping shape?
Wrestling most things before breakfast?

322
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,180
Not often find crocodiles in cold water.

323
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,460
What do you think this is, a picnic?

324
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,450
The sooner you people realize,
we're in the wilds of Africa
surrounded by hostile savages,

325
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,170
the better chance we'll have
of getting out of here alive.

326
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,490
I told you last night:
it's useless waiting for any plane.

327
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,390
What time is it, Gamage?

328
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,650
8 o'clock.

329
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:31,210
If they picked up our signal,
they'd have spotted us by now.

330
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,620
Well, it didn't happen,
so let's get moving.

331
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,290
Hawkins right.

332
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:40,020
You go by fire and dry.

333
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,100
-- Better put your shoes on, Diana.
-- Oh, thanks.

334
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,970
You always walk in these?

335
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,900
What's wrong with them?
Not every woman can take a tall heel.

336
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,900
Not good in jungle.

337
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,870
What's that?

338
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,310
Cheta.

339
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,520
My mink, how did she get it?

340
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:26,250
Cheta go back to sky bird last night.
Likes bottle.

341
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,700
If that monkey is not careful,
it'll stunt her growth.

342
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,920
Bad Cheta.

343
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,880
What kind of fur this?

344
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,880
Mink, and don't ask me how I got it.

345
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,770
Same way the mink did.

346
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,740
Make good skin for feet.

347
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,660
Someone hurt you?

348
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:57,140
Yes, you, where it hurts most.

349
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,170
You take off shoes, too.

350
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:24,330
How many times do I have to tell you
to quit fooling around?
We've gotta get moving!

351
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,770
Girls need skin for feet in jungle.

352
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,500
Oh, we're gonna be the first skwos
who ever wore the mink moccasins!

353
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,850
-- I go on front, make trail.
You go behind.
-- Sure.

354
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,710
Watch bushes for snakes.

355
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,130
Watch high grass for leopard.
Watch tree for leopard.

356
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,550
Watch behind you for Opar men.

357
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,920
Watch for bad ants.
Kill quick with hot needle.

358
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,870
They eat your eyes, eat your tongue,
eat your meat. No eat bones.

359
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,850
Choosy, eh?

360
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:55,800
Hawkins scout like hunting dog,
look for Opar men.

361
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,200
Oh, we'll never make it.

362
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,410
We try.

363
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,360
Fear in head make feet heavy.
But light heart make feet happy.

364
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,850
Even the rain's hot.

365
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,160
I'd say, wet, too.

366
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,560
I can't think of anything,
but a large cold glass of beer.

367
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,020
Mink and mud don't mix.

368
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,940
A week ago we could have had
any drink we wanted.

369
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,320
A week ago...

370
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,830
Yeah, it makes you appreciate
a lot of things that didn't seem
to matter before.

371
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,060
Does it?

372
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,860
Don't you think so?

373
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,300
Yeah.

374
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,480
Animal trail good. Now we go quick.

375
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,850
What trail?

376
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,850
When we get in jungle, no trail.

377
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:54,200
Jungle? What do you call this?

378
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,340
What do you think they're saying?

379
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,820
Me not think. Me not man of Opar.

380
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,380
Huh, we have a real passport, anyway.
As long as I'm around,
they won't bother us.

381
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,680
Even lion keep eye open for wild dog.

382
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,650
Now, we covered a lot of ground today,
making good time.

383
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,700
I suppose you might say,
it's lucky you met me.

384
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:38,600
Thank you. My husband and I
are very grateful to you.

385
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,700
Lucky for me, too.

386
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:45,170
The guy gets kind of lonely for
a woman's company out here in the jungle.

387
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:47,040
You don't have to stay in the jungle.

388
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:49,470
I won't. Not much longer.

389
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,200
I've got big money coming to me.
You've ever heard of the tusks of Opar?

390
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,090
Ivory they collected for a 1000 years.

391
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,770
I noticed where it is
and how to get at it.

392
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,770
What do you say?

393
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,500
Oh, what can I say,
except that it sounds wonderful?

394
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:07,630
I'll say it is...
we're sticking around for it.

395
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,220
I'm very happy for you.
Good luck, Mr. Hawkins.

396
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,010
Tired?

397
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:23,900
Yes, but... pleasantly tired.

398
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:28,060
I never thought I could sleep
on bare ground and wake up full of that.

399
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,940
Too beautiful a night to waste
on sleep, anyhow.

400
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:35,280
Jungle always beautiful at night.
Sometimes I no sleep, too.

401
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,010
-- She scared me.
-- Cheta!

402
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:55,330
What's the matter, Doodles?
Lost your strength?

403
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:09,150
Thank you.

404
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:12,880
Tell me, Tarzan, you always lived
in the jungle?

405
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:14,340
Yes.

406
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,500
But your English,
your understanding of our needs...
Where did you learn all this?

407
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:23,060
Many hunters come, missionaries,
people, sometimes friends.

408
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,790
They talk, I listen, learn that art.

409
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,850
Your people, family?

410
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,040
Killed when I was little baby.

411
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:32,890
Baby alone in the jungle?
How did you survive?

412
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:35,790
Kerchak, the great ape. She find me.

413
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,490
I learned to swing in trees.

414
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,180
When I grow big I go away from apes
and see men.

415
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:47,850
I learned to walk on two feet.

416
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:51,800
I see men talk, I hear men talk.

417
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:57,920
I also learned about their ways.

418
00:46:57,970 --> 00:46:59,730
One of the savages?

419
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:02,330
Man of Opar.

420
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:05,870
Yes, and if we don't let him go,
we'll have a whole mob of them
attacking us.

421
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,630
What do we do now? Swim?

422
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:07,810
No, follow river. We find place to cross,
but be careful!

423
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:11,080
Easy for Opar men to watch safari
in open country.

424
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,150
Keep close together.

425
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,940
Hey, look at those hippos!

426
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,480
That one leader of herd.

427
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:48,890
He's got quite a harem.

428
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,610
Don't like the way he's staring at us.

429
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:54,800
Maybe he doesn't like the way
you're staring at him either.

430
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,100
Come on, Diana, close up.

431
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,460
Wait!

432
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:19,130
Hawkins. You stay close to girls,
keep gun ready. I'll lead.

433
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,530
Do you mind if I stay close to you, too?

434
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:25,710
If we get through this, you'll
have to go along way down the river
before I'll ever cross it.

435
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,610
You're tired?

436
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:20,910
Tired?!! My back aches, my head aches,
and my mink feet are worn out.

437
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,070
Come on, Gamage, you will make it.

438
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,390
-- Wait!
-- Now what?

439
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,290
Women hungry. You eat.

440
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:53,250
Great, my favorite food. Thanks!

441
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,060
We'll rest on other side of swamp.

442
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,490
Swamp?!! Ohhh...

443
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,320
Do we have to go into that?

444
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,560
Yes. Not deep.

445
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,400
Stand up!

446
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,500
Cobweb spider.

447
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,500
Bite will kill.

448
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,140
I nearly walked into it!

449
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,280
Well, let's get away from here,
swamp or no swamp. Come on, Doodles.

450
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,850
If we ever get near a telephone,
this'll make quite a story.

451
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:57,710
Yeah, millionaire playboy and party
made their way back from wedding.

452
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,290
I'll take care of her.

453
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,110
Watch yourself, Diana.

454
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,660
Couldn't agree with you more.

455
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,080
Mind if I hang on, too?

456
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,530
Keep eye open for crocodile.

457
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,420
Crocodile?

458
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,560
Are you sure you know
where you're heading?

459
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:27,130
Eagle Mountain. This shortest way.

460
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:29,480
See? He's not as dumb as you think he is.

461
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,430
I'm not so sure.
I know this territory pretty well.

462
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,870
But I've never gone on this way before.

463
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,530
Say that again, I've never traveled
this way before either.

464
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,650
Thanks heavens, we're out of that!

465
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:48,270
I can't go another yard.

466
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:50,110
You're right.

467
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,540
This isn't shortcut.

468
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:54,480
If that was a short,
then I'd hate to go the long way.

469
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,420
We make camp here for night.

470
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,860
Quiet!

471
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,670
Maybe some animal.

472
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,020
Maybe two-legged animal.

473
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,130
Good night, Dick.

474
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,600
Tarzan, don't you ever rest?

475
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,520
Tarzan watch. Watch danger.

476
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:43,620
Long walk to Eagle Mountain.
Better girl sleep.

477
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,850
I can't sleep.

478
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:48,740
Girl think about mate?

479
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,420
Him and other things.

480
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:56,240
He think about you.
I see his eyes when he look at you.

481
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,530
You're wrong, Tarzan.
He doesn't care about me.

482
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,430
When we get back howe,
we're going to separate.

483
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:04,770
Sep... Separate?

484
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:06,860
What mean "separate"?

485
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:12,770
Well... In our country when a man
and a woman can't get along
with each other, they...

486
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,240
...separate, leave each other.

487
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:18,820
In jungle, girl need man to protect her.

488
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:22,480
And man need mate. You good mate any man.

489
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:25,140
I watch you. You brave.

490
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,160
I couldn't have put it better myself.

491
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,850
Only I wouldn't have expected to find you
making a pass of another man's wife.

492
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,700
What is "pass"?

493
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:37,210
He means, making love to me.

494
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:39,250
That's putting it politely.

495
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,540
But I were about to find that
if there's who has right to make up
to this lady, surely it's me.

496
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,250
Didn't I save her life?

497
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:46,940
Did you?

498
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:50,750
Everybody knows I did.

499
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,920
If you did, then you fine and brave, too.

500
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:58,170
And yet, you speak such words
as if your heart were black.

501
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:01,450
-- What have I done?
-- I say what I feel here.

502
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:06,220
I see in Hawkins's face, and wonder:
why you not worry more we get near Opar?

503
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,880
Why should I worry?

504
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,140
Opar men always bad.

505
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,980
-- Listen, Tarzan, I don't know what you...
-- Quiet!

506
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:47,140
Poison spider bite him.

507
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:03,300
Poison stay too long.

508
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:06,220
Maybe we too, stay too long.

509
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,930
What do you mean by that?

510
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:10,500
This last night near Opar country.

511
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:13,920
Better Tarzan take you now.
We walk all night.

512
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,300
Tomorrow Tarzan take you to gorge.
Then all safe.

513
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:20,560
Hurry, get ready. We go now.
You put out fire.

514
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,990
-- You know way to gorge?
-- Certainly.

515
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:28,130
Good. This time you go in front.

516
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,860
All right.

517
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:43,480
Coming to gorge now.

518
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:46,720
Thank heaven, if I had to go any
further at night, I'd collapse.

519
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:50,310
Many rocks and fallen trees.
Must've been big flood.

520
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,030
There's nothing unusual about that.

521
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,890
Hey, Doodles, go hand to hand
with Diana, will ya?

522
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:13,070
When you make last trip to gorge?

523
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,860
A few weeks ago. Why?

524
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,080
Must have been after flood.

525
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:24,420
Wait!

526
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,130
You knew gorge was blocked.

527
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,250
It was open when I came through.

528
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,140
You lie. Blocked many months.

529
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:50,370
Mud dried long time by sun.

530
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:56,410
You keep guard on Hawkins,
and all stay here.

531
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,560
I go find another way to coast.

532
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,240
Must be some way natives enter gorge.
I try to find out.

533
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:44,830
You go and shelter off cliffs.
Much danger if you stay in open. Go!

534
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,480
Go back, Cheta! You stay!

535
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:03,200
-- Got a sigarette, Dick?
-- Yeah. My last one.

536
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,350
Oh, forget it then.

537
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,250
Oh, don't be silly. You take it.
Here, Diana.

538
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,060
Thanks.

539
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,240
All right, Cheta. You do it.

540
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:23,040
Thank you, Cheta.

541
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:28,860
What was your object, Hawkins?
What did you expect to get out of this?

542
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,480
I don't know what you mean.

543
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:34,840
It's money you're after?
Why didn't you say so?
We'd have paid you well for helping us.

544
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:01,760
What's the matter with Cheta?

545
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:35,810
Where are you taking us?

546
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:39,820
Let me loose!
Get your filthy hands off me!

547
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:44,760
This'll make a great story
if I live to write it.

548
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:48,360
Take it easy, I won't let
anything happen to you.

549
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,500
-- Oh, Tarzan sure had you figured.
-- Yeah.

550
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,180
Nogomo.

551
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,700
You go first to village.
Tell Ogonoore, safari captured.

552
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:03,150
Take long time to get whites
through mountain.

553
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:19,300
Leave open. Tarzan will follow. Go now!

554
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,780
Stay here. Capture Tarzan.

555
01:08:54,350 --> 01:08:55,840
Cheta.

556
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:01,070
Go, Cheta! Do as I told you.

557
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:03,340
Go, Cheta!

558
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:55,860
I told you I wasn't going to let
anything happen to you, didn't I?

559
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,100
Dick!

560
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,020
Why you bring girl here?

561
01:12:50,060 --> 01:12:53,410
She belongs to me.
She's not for sacrifice.

562
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:59,100
5 whites in sky bird. If Hawkins wants
tusks of Opar, 5 must die!

563
01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:03,200
You will get your 5 whites.
Tarzan will be trapped.

564
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:49,650
Drum say Tarzan captured.

565
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:51,470
Kill them!

566
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:03,260
Listen!

567
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:05,070
What's the matter?

568
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:09,400
-- Drum say Hawkins betrayed
chief Ogonoore!
-- It's not true!

569
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:12,210
Drum say you're going to burn my village!

570
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:15,920
What? Well, how can I? I'm right here!

571
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:27,720
Drum speak truth. You traitor!

572
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:31,460
You burning all fire. Go, take him!

573
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,000
Quick! Get me untied!

574
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:55,760
Tarzan!

575
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:05,860
Untie this. Must cross bridge before it burns!

576
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:08,970
I have nothing to do with it!

577
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:11,360
The drum has lied!

578
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:14,420
Let's go quick. Follow to gorge.

579
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:20,580
I tell you I didn't betray you.
How could I have done it?

580
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:24,900
You betray your people.
Maybe you betray me!

581
01:17:26,620 --> 01:17:28,590
Let me go!

582
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:49,220
No! I tell ya, I have nothing to do with it!

583
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,420
Look! It's Tarzan! They're escaping!

584
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:16,850
When light of fire dies,
we make our escape.

585
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:20,200
Diana.

586
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:24,940
If we ever make it home, I have to cancel
my order for that big plane.

587
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,380
We'll make it, darling!

588
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:29,380
The End.

589
