2
00:00:45,169 --> 00:00:48,069
Oh, my God, look at that.

3
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:51,409
It's so sad that they all messed
their lives up, those people.

4
00:00:54,077 --> 00:00:56,914
Say, why did
the bum vote for Obama?

5
00:00:59,615 --> 00:01:01,682
You're supposed to say, "Why?"

6
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:03,453
Okay. Why?

7
00:01:04,053 --> 00:01:05,720
Because he wanted change.

8
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:09,761
Wow, that's funny, Mr. Cohen.

9
00:01:11,995 --> 00:01:15,800
- Hey, you remember my cousin Matt, the actor?
- Mm-hmm.

10
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:18,600
Yeah, he's doing
a show on Broadway now

11
00:01:18,602 --> 00:01:21,068
and we're gonna tear up
the town together.

12
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,536
Wow.

13
00:01:22,538 --> 00:01:24,639
Yeah, he knows some
of the real cool spots,

14
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:26,475
real underground places,
you know?

15
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,482
I thought you were gonna
drop me off in the Village.

16
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:34,783
Mr. Cohen, I told you,

17
00:01:34,785 --> 00:01:37,921
your mom said that I need to make
sure you get into your meeting.

18
00:01:55,838 --> 00:01:56,807
Traitor.

19
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:32,877
Oh, gosh.

20
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:34,575
Hi, everyone.

21
00:02:34,577 --> 00:02:36,911
Welcome to the summer semester
of Connections.

22
00:02:36,913 --> 00:02:39,613
Over here on this table
we've got some clipboards.

23
00:02:39,615 --> 00:02:40,881
That's where you'll register.

24
00:02:40,883 --> 00:02:43,885
If you have any questions
about Lit Club,

25
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:45,020
you can ask Mar.

26
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:47,389
Paint and Pottery,
you can ask Annie.

27
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:50,592
- She knows everything there is about those groups...
- Excuse me, please.

28
00:02:50,594 --> 00:02:55,897
And if you have any question about
Drama Dreams, we have Sarah and Sammy.

29
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:58,199
They can tell you anything
you need to know about those.

30
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:01,101
Would you like to talk
a little bit about Drama Dreams?

31
00:03:01,103 --> 00:03:02,771
- Yes!
- Okay.

32
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:04,642
- Yes, Dorsey.
- All right, here you go.

33
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,277
Hi, everyone. Welcome.

34
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:12,647
Drama Dreams is...
is a wonderful,

35
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:16,250
magnificent opportunity
and way to shine

36
00:03:16,252 --> 00:03:18,018
and do a little mix and match.

37
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,021
And we do a lot of...
a great deal of acting

38
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:24,092
and improvisation
and spontaneous performances

39
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:25,659
and... that are so flexible.

40
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:28,129
You go with the flow.

41
00:03:28,131 --> 00:03:29,931
And it's very unscripted, so...

42
00:03:31,868 --> 00:03:33,735
This is such a good prawn.

43
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:36,204
- Yeah.
- The music's really great.

44
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:37,372
Yeah.

45
00:03:37,374 --> 00:03:40,742
Because if you saw what
happened with Bernie Madoff

46
00:03:40,744 --> 00:03:42,343
and all the other people

47
00:03:42,345 --> 00:03:45,046
and AIG and Lehman Brothers,

48
00:03:45,048 --> 00:03:48,816
we were kinda like bookies,
or so I found out later on.

49
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:52,386
- And then, kinda like...
- Wait, who's Bernie Madoff?

50
00:03:52,388 --> 00:03:56,091
He's a man who
ripped off investors.

51
00:03:56,093 --> 00:04:00,295
His initials are B.M.
for a good reason.

52
00:04:00,297 --> 00:04:03,034
Because he is
a human bowel movement.

53
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:06,700
I know it's your
first time here.

54
00:04:06,702 --> 00:04:10,639
Downstairs, there's,
I think, this juice bar.

55
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:13,074
They've got this really good
kale shake down there

56
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:15,843
if you wanna do
a little juicing with me.

57
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,681
What is it with the fruity music
in this place?

58
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:21,618
Do you have a problem
with the music?

59
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,121
Oh no, man.
It's cool, it's cool. I'm good.

60
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:29,356
Who's the new initiate
and what's wrong with him?

61
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:33,928
Well, I guess it's just,
you know, sensory overload.

62
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,832
I don't have a problem.
I'm just passing through.

63
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:39,737
I bet you say that
to all the boys.

64
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:44,007
Mom!

65
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:46,877
I'm not going back there!

66
00:04:49,012 --> 00:04:50,178
Hold on.

67
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,182
Mom!

68
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:56,887
I said I'm not going back there!

69
00:04:57,921 --> 00:04:59,320
You want to go
to jail, David?

70
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:01,091
You want to ruin
your father's life?

71
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:03,661
Dad, make her stop!

72
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:07,428
I mean, I know she hates me,

73
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,899
and she just wants me
to roll up and die

74
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:13,734
and... and wants me jump off
a goddamn roof.

75
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:16,036
David, give it a rest. Okay?

76
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:19,940
It's not therapy.
It's a fruitcake place.

77
00:05:19,942 --> 00:05:23,445
Like the judge said, you
show up, you sign your name,

78
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:25,779
six weeks later: dismissed.

79
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:29,120
Maybe next time,
don't tell pig jokes to a cop.

80
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:32,857
And what the hell
am I gonna tell Angie?

81
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:34,488
Who's Angie?

82
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,127
She's the girl that I'm seeing.

83
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:38,325
I thought her name
was Melinda.

84
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:40,794
No, that didn't work out
between me and Melinda.

85
00:05:40,796 --> 00:05:42,262
If Angie has a problem
with this,

86
00:05:42,264 --> 00:05:44,733
her mother can give me a call.

87
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:48,102
Ooh!

88
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:51,371
Aah!

89
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:53,810
- David, please.
- Aah!

90
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,846
Sorry. I can't help it.
I'm trying.

91
00:05:58,815 --> 00:05:59,981
I don't belong there, Mom.

92
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:02,282
I don't like the look
of the people at that place

93
00:06:02,284 --> 00:06:03,585
any better than you do.

94
00:06:03,587 --> 00:06:07,354
But if you don't do this, you
won't be able to leave the state.

95
00:06:07,356 --> 00:06:10,224
No Florida, no beach club.

96
00:06:10,226 --> 00:06:13,294
You'll spend the rest of the year
stuck up here with Aunt Rudy.

97
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:15,130
Is that what you want?

98
00:06:15,132 --> 00:06:16,231
No.

99
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:17,832
Just get it over with then

100
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:20,135
so everything can
go back to normal.

101
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:23,203
Mmm!

102
00:06:23,205 --> 00:06:24,505
Oh, sweetheart.

103
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:26,875
Come, let's have some fruit.

104
00:06:26,877 --> 00:06:29,310
You go lie down
with some fruit,

105
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:33,784
maybe a cool bath, your pj's.

106
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:17,959
Hi. I'm Mar. What's your name?

107
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:19,460
My name is Sammy.

108
00:07:19,462 --> 00:07:21,563
It's nice to meet you, Sammy.

109
00:07:21,565 --> 00:07:23,431
It's nice to meet you, Mar.

110
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:27,501
I'm so happy that you are
here in this organization

111
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:29,974
that my parents
really helped found.

112
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:31,972
That's so...

113
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:34,177
And Connections
is a branch of that.

114
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:38,580
Oops.
Sorry to cut you off, Sammy.

115
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:41,582
I have trouble
reading non-verbal cues

116
00:07:41,584 --> 00:07:44,354
'cause of my
vision impairment.

117
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:53,126
That's okay, Mar.

118
00:07:53,128 --> 00:07:56,397
I'm always respectful
to people around me.

119
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,202
Their needs and their wishes.

120
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:00,467
That's so cool.

121
00:08:03,005 --> 00:08:05,606
Mar and Sammy, that was great.
Thank you so much.

122
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:08,178
Who wants to go next?

123
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:10,411
Sarah. All right.

124
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:11,382
Who's gonna partner with Sarah?

125
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:15,048
Andrew, how about you?

126
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,752
Haven't heard
from you much today.

127
00:08:20,623 --> 00:08:22,091
Okay.

128
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,095
Hey, David.

129
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:30,130
We're gonna stick
with the same thing.

130
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:33,500
Friendly conversations with
people who we maybe have just met

131
00:08:33,502 --> 00:08:35,270
or don't know very well.

132
00:08:35,272 --> 00:08:36,437
Does that sound okay?

133
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:38,039
Yeah, sounds
like a plan.

134
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,310
All right.
David, sound okay to you?

135
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:42,910
Yeah.

136
00:08:42,912 --> 00:08:45,178
Okay. Go for it.

137
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,016
So, David, what would you
like to talk about?

138
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:54,121
Do you like to speak
about movies, operas,

139
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:58,159
ballets, Broadway musicals?

140
00:08:58,161 --> 00:08:59,294
No.

141
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:00,629
Me neither.

142
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:05,401
I'm not really crazy about speaking
about any of that kind of stuff.

143
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:11,005
Yes, Sarah.

144
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:15,043
Dorsey, David's being
really quiet and shy.

145
00:09:15,045 --> 00:09:16,644
He's not participating.

146
00:09:16,646 --> 00:09:20,414
He's not contributing to his
fair share in the conversation.

147
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:25,053
He's just being so...
really, in dead silence.

148
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:27,288
So, let's ask
the group what they think

149
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,558
could help David be more
involved in the conversation.

150
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,563
I think Sarah threw a little too much
information at David all at once.

151
00:09:36,565 --> 00:09:40,068
Sometimes, when you're in a
conversation with someone new,

152
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,302
that's not good.

153
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:43,037
It can scare them.

154
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,639
Any other suggestions?

155
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:48,042
You cannot bring up
a conversation topic

156
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:50,010
if neither of you
is interested.

157
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:52,282
So let's find
a common interest.

158
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:55,252
David, you can even pick
the interest.

159
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:58,720
How about the Brooklyn Bridge?

160
00:09:58,722 --> 00:10:01,322
Oh! Okay!
That sounds wonderful.

161
00:10:01,324 --> 00:10:06,660
Uh... wha... what do you really
love and enjoy the most

162
00:10:06,662 --> 00:10:09,664
about doing
at the Brooklyn Bridge?

163
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:13,101
I mean, we should really
make some plans to go together.

164
00:10:13,103 --> 00:10:15,068
That would be very
interesting for both of us.

165
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,038
We can both have
a wonderful time together.

166
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,343
We can both
jump off the bridge.

167
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:26,414
Dorsey, David's really, really
not cooperating with me.

168
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:31,251
I can't believe she... she
actually took me so seriously.

169
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:33,487
Well, David, I actually
think that this would be

170
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:38,025
a really wonderful homework
assignment for the two of you.

171
00:10:38,027 --> 00:10:39,760
You can practice those
conversation skills

172
00:10:39,762 --> 00:10:42,031
and come back and share that
with the group.

173
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,502
David, I need you
to cooperate.

174
00:10:48,103 --> 00:10:49,370
Just missed
my freakin' elevator.

175
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:50,638
I just want to get out
of this building.

176
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,372
David,
that's very irrelevant.

177
00:10:52,374 --> 00:10:54,708
We need to focus on getting our
homework assignment completed

178
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,110
that Dorsey assigned us to.

179
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:57,812
This is very
exciting for me.

180
00:10:57,814 --> 00:10:59,813
- Maybe for you...
- We want to report...

181
00:10:59,815 --> 00:11:02,283
My job and my
responsibility, David,

182
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:04,419
is to report to Dorsey and keep her posted...

183
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:08,322
...on how everything goes that we
observe at the Brooklyn Bridge.

184
00:11:08,324 --> 00:11:09,823
We have to make this plan.

185
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:11,159
We were the one
that committed.

186
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:13,061
We have to stick
to our commitments

187
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:15,263
and plan properly.

188
00:11:15,265 --> 00:11:16,331
Bye.

189
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,366
David, we have to make...
We're not planning properly.

190
00:11:18,368 --> 00:11:20,635
We have
to plan properly, David.

191
00:11:20,637 --> 00:11:22,539
See you later.
Have a nice life.

192
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,726
- Hi.
- Hi.

193
00:11:45,728 --> 00:11:47,428
- You must be Angie.
- David?

194
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,263
- I'm David. That's right.
- So nice to meet you.

195
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:50,264
- It's great to meet you.
- I didn't know

196
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,500
if you were gonna
recognize me from the website.

197
00:11:52,502 --> 00:11:56,236
You look even more beautiful than...
in person than on your profile.

198
00:11:56,238 --> 00:11:57,404
Oh, my God.

199
00:11:57,406 --> 00:11:58,939
Thank you.
Oh, my gosh, sorry.

200
00:11:58,941 --> 00:12:04,047
I'm usually not this nervous, but, you
know, I rarely meet nice, normal, guys.

201
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,645
Thank you.

202
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:07,215
Thanks.

203
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:10,584
- Um, so, do you want anything to eat or anything?
- Uh-uh.

204
00:12:10,586 --> 00:12:12,319
You seem hungry or nervous
or something...

205
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:16,591
- No, I'm on this no-carb diet.
- Mmm.

206
00:12:16,593 --> 00:12:18,793
So that's all you.

207
00:12:18,795 --> 00:12:21,662
Did you know that milk
had carbs in them?

208
00:12:21,664 --> 00:12:23,463
- Wow, milk had carbs.
- Yeah.

209
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:25,799
So, I'm excited about
this U2 concert tonight...

210
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:29,470
Yes, me too! I love U2!

211
00:12:29,472 --> 00:12:30,871
- I love Bono. I'm obsessed with him...
- Yes...

212
00:12:30,873 --> 00:12:32,206
I know everything about him,

213
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:35,909
like his date of birth:
May 10, 1960.

214
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:38,246
- Whoa, 1960...
- Yeah.

215
00:12:38,248 --> 00:12:40,213
You kind of look
like him a little bit.

216
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:41,682
Hello, hello!

217
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:43,818
- Yeah, the glasses...
- That's good.

218
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,419
That's good.

219
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:48,291
Um, do you always
keep your sunglasses on?

220
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:52,628
Sorry.

221
00:12:53,695 --> 00:12:55,298
Aah!

222
00:12:55,831 --> 00:12:57,731
Aah!

223
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:58,798
It's my allergies.

224
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,867
Do you need a napkin?

225
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:02,272
No, I just...

226
00:13:03,238 --> 00:13:06,243
So, um,
you into sports at all?

227
00:13:07,243 --> 00:13:09,677
- Um, sort of.
- You heard of Kobe Bryant?

228
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,483
Yeah, this morning,
he was traded to the LA Rapers.

229
00:13:14,783 --> 00:13:15,816
I'm sorry.
That wasn't funny.

230
00:13:15,818 --> 00:13:17,250
I got a funnier one.

231
00:13:17,252 --> 00:13:22,258
"My two favorite
things: Jell-O pudding and rape."

232
00:13:23,225 --> 00:13:25,261
I'm just gonna run
to the bathroom.

233
00:13:46,682 --> 00:13:48,184
Aah!

234
00:13:59,728 --> 00:14:01,996
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me.

235
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:03,965
Sorry.

236
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:05,302
Angie!

237
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:07,703
Anj!

238
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:10,972
Hi.

239
00:15:56,878 --> 00:15:59,449
Such a fucking bum!

240
00:16:01,818 --> 00:16:03,687
Fucking bum!

241
00:16:07,623 --> 00:16:09,423
<i>Welcome to Drama Therapy.</i>

242
00:16:09,425 --> 00:16:10,824
I'm so happy
to be here, Delilah.

243
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:12,226
Excellent.

244
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:15,096
So, this summer, we're actually gonna
be working towards a performance.

245
00:16:15,098 --> 00:16:16,130
- Really?
- Ooh!

246
00:16:16,132 --> 00:16:17,365
- Ooh!
- Yes.

247
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:18,665
Ooh, wow!

248
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:20,467
Yeah, and what
we're gonna be doing

249
00:16:20,469 --> 00:16:23,737
is we're going to be
exploring who we are.

250
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:27,475
And then we're gonna be able
to show that to the world.

251
00:16:27,477 --> 00:16:29,510
And so one of the things
we're gonna do this summer

252
00:16:29,512 --> 00:16:34,715
is we're going to create our performance
around the idea of superheroes.

253
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:35,882
Ooh!

254
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:38,052
So what I want you
guys to be thinking about,

255
00:16:38,054 --> 00:16:41,688
think about, if you had a superhero
power, what would it be?

256
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,756
- I love it.
- I love it!

257
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:44,558
- That is fantastic!
- Great idea!

258
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,897
I love it. It's just
what I've wanted for years.

259
00:17:03,478 --> 00:17:05,912
David. What happened?

260
00:17:05,914 --> 00:17:08,719
- What?
- You missed our homework assignment.

261
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:11,285
What homework assignment?

262
00:17:11,287 --> 00:17:15,089
Remember, we were supposed to write
a report about the Brooklyn Bridge.

263
00:17:15,091 --> 00:17:18,726
Look, how about this? Why don't
we do this professionally, okay?

264
00:17:18,728 --> 00:17:20,561
I'm going to pay you money
to do this.

265
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:22,630
I mean, you want money.
How much do you want, 20?

266
00:17:22,632 --> 00:17:24,832
David, that's
not the assignment.

267
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,766
You're giving me
a really hard time

268
00:17:26,768 --> 00:17:29,437
which is completely not okay,
completely unacceptable.

269
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:33,607
Look, David, if you're not gonna cooperate with me

270
00:17:33,609 --> 00:17:35,042
and contribute
to your fair share,

271
00:17:35,044 --> 00:17:38,646
I'm going to advocate myself
and speak my mind to Dorsey,

272
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:41,515
'cause this is
completely unacceptable.

273
00:17:41,517 --> 00:17:43,650
Okay, you want to go
to the Brooklyn Bridge?

274
00:17:43,652 --> 00:17:45,785
We'll go
to the Brooklyn Bridge, okay?

275
00:17:45,787 --> 00:17:47,521
We'll go to
the Brooklyn Bridge, okay?

276
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:48,956
Will that get you off my case?

277
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,990
- What does "off your case" mean?
- Will you be satisfied?

278
00:17:50,992 --> 00:17:53,194
It means you'll be satisfied!

279
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:54,661
Very much so.

280
00:17:54,663 --> 00:17:55,596
Taxi!

281
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:59,533
Um, I find it
really, really scary.

282
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:01,601
I feel so much
safer on the bus.

283
00:18:01,603 --> 00:18:06,239
And the only way to get home to my grandmother's
home, safe and sound, is the bus.

284
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:10,244
And taxis are so expensive and
I find them so nerve-racking.

285
00:18:10,246 --> 00:18:11,879
What are you Rain Man
or something?

286
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:14,113
I mean, you have to have
a system for everything.

287
00:18:14,115 --> 00:18:18,185
Uh, gotta go to Kmart,
41 Oak Street, lights at 11:00.

288
00:18:18,187 --> 00:18:21,889
Don't you just want to live without
going according to the system,

289
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:24,691
without sticking
to the line once?

290
00:18:24,693 --> 00:18:26,192
Believe me, I took the bus once.

291
00:18:26,194 --> 00:18:28,696
It was a messed-up
experience for me.

292
00:18:28,698 --> 00:18:32,265
I mean, I got on the bus.
It was goddamn crowded.

293
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:33,833
I felt like a sardine.

294
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:36,669
Then when I sat down,
this homeless guy got up to me

295
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,973
and started harassing
the shit out of me.

296
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,176
And I felt like yelling out
"hobophobic" slurs.

297
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:44,111
Not homophobic, "hobophobic."

298
00:18:44,113 --> 00:18:45,246
What's "hobophobic"?

299
00:18:45,248 --> 00:18:47,281
It's a phobia against bums.

300
00:18:47,283 --> 00:18:50,650
Look, it's one thing if you want
to take the bus by yourself.

301
00:18:50,652 --> 00:18:52,285
You can do whatever the hell
you want on your own.

302
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,255
But when you're with me,
let's take a cab.

303
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:56,090
I mean, buses are for paupers,

304
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:59,595
and cabs are for the prince
and the princess.

305
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,063
You know, why don't you just sit
back, lay back and enjoy the ride.

306
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:05,765
Okay.

307
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:06,969
How much
do I owe you, sir?

308
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:09,169
7.50.

309
00:19:09,171 --> 00:19:11,641
Here you go, $20.
Keep the change.

310
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:19,615
Come on.

311
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:33,294
Come on! Come join me, David!

312
00:19:33,296 --> 00:19:35,728
I'm having a wonderful time!

313
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,831
My first time ever
at the Brooklyn Bridge!

314
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,969
It's a gorgeous
bird's-eye view!

315
00:19:57,286 --> 00:19:59,620
Where are you going, David?

316
00:19:59,622 --> 00:20:01,054
I'm free now.

317
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:03,357
But how am I getting home?

318
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,958
How do you
usually get home?

319
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,226
I plan to take my bus.

320
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:07,695
So then, take the bus.

321
00:20:07,697 --> 00:20:10,698
The bus from the JCC
is the only way

322
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,234
I know how to get home
to my grandmother's home safely,

323
00:20:14,236 --> 00:20:15,936
and I count 13 stops.

324
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:18,973
Oh, Jesus.
How old are you, Sarah?

325
00:20:18,975 --> 00:20:21,041
David, I'm 24.

326
00:20:21,043 --> 00:20:22,810
And how long have you
been living in New York?

327
00:20:22,812 --> 00:20:25,211
I've been living
in New York City my whole life

328
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:27,614
since I was
a little born child.

329
00:20:27,616 --> 00:20:30,918
So, you mean to tell me you've
been in this town for 24 years

330
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,321
and you don't know how to get to
your grandmother's house from here?

331
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:36,390
Well, the JCC...
the bus from the JCC

332
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:38,691
is the only way I know
how to get home.

333
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:40,763
That's the only way.

334
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,863
You happy now?

335
00:20:43,865 --> 00:20:47,001
I had to take you all the way
back to the JCC bus stop.

336
00:20:47,003 --> 00:20:49,035
I guess you want to take
the bus, we'll take the...

337
00:20:49,037 --> 00:20:52,305
Look, here we go. It's
your bus stop right there.

338
00:20:52,307 --> 00:20:53,943
Okay? Take the bus, okay?

339
00:20:55,311 --> 00:20:57,244
What?

340
00:20:57,246 --> 00:20:58,715
Um...

341
00:20:59,848 --> 00:21:00,880
Uh...

342
00:21:00,882 --> 00:21:01,849
Yeah?

343
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:04,118
Um, David... Um, David...

344
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,886
- What?
- Um...

345
00:21:05,888 --> 00:21:07,688
W-What about... What about...

346
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,122
What about... What happened?

347
00:21:09,124 --> 00:21:12,126
When are we gonna finish
our homework assignment?

348
00:21:12,128 --> 00:21:14,661
About the Brooklyn Bridge?
We were there all day.

349
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:15,728
We just did.

350
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,863
But it's not complete.

351
00:21:16,865 --> 00:21:19,867
We're supposed to
write a report about it.

352
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:22,902
Well, I don't know. Do it
with one of your friends.

353
00:21:22,904 --> 00:21:26,674
But, David, I really feel strongly
about doing this with you.

354
00:21:26,676 --> 00:21:28,876
I really, really
want to do it with you

355
00:21:28,878 --> 00:21:32,949
because I find you
really smoking hot and so sexy.

356
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:05,845
Hey, Mom!

357
00:22:05,847 --> 00:22:08,348
Is it okay if Geraldo drives
me into the city, today?

358
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,752
Well, it's a Sunday.
What are you doing in the city?

359
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:13,923
I just feel like
hanging out and stuff.

360
00:22:15,891 --> 00:22:18,191
You know,
for that group.

361
00:22:18,193 --> 00:22:20,828
I didn't think you were forced
to go there on the weekend.

362
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,796
Do I need to make a call
to that woman Dorothy?

363
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:24,931
No, no, no. It's not that.

364
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:27,066
It's this voluntary thing,
you know?

365
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:27,935
Voluntary?

366
00:22:27,937 --> 00:22:30,938
I just uh, figured
I'd get extra credit.

367
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,038
They'd let me out earlier

368
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,007
for, like,
good behavior and stuff.

369
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:39,246
You're here
to audition for my play.

370
00:22:39,248 --> 00:22:42,248
Um, a lot of you are
vying for the same part.

371
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,920
I hope that this does not cause any
problems with your relationships.

372
00:22:47,922 --> 00:22:51,060
These pages aren't numbered,
but flip... flip the page.

373
00:22:52,862 --> 00:22:54,831
Here, scene three.
Do you see it, Sarah?

374
00:22:58,234 --> 00:22:59,466
Pardon me, pretty lady.

375
00:22:59,468 --> 00:23:01,968
I couldn't help
but notice you in tears.

376
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,274
What seems to be the trouble?
I'd love to help.

377
00:23:06,475 --> 00:23:13,380
<i>♪ He really is going to be
My knight in shining armor ♪</i>

378
00:23:13,382 --> 00:23:15,515
<i>♪ My Prince Charming ♪</i>

379
00:23:15,517 --> 00:23:16,984
David! You made it.

380
00:23:16,986 --> 00:23:20,521
I want you to audition for my play, for
the leading role of Travis McHenry.

381
00:23:21,923 --> 00:23:26,226
You look just like my idol
that I have loved

382
00:23:26,228 --> 00:23:27,794
ever since I was a teen.

383
00:23:27,796 --> 00:23:30,898
He's on a show
that did not last very long,

384
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,132
but it's called
<i>Malibu Mohawks.</i>

385
00:23:33,134 --> 00:23:35,872
Oh, <i>Malibu Mohawks.</i>
My cousin was on that show!

386
00:23:36,872 --> 00:23:37,804
Your... wait, your cousin?

387
00:23:37,806 --> 00:23:39,108
Matt Cone. Matt Cone.

388
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:41,408
Matt Cone's your cousin?

389
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,942
He's my cousin.

390
00:23:42,944 --> 00:23:45,445
He's more like a brother to me
because I really...

391
00:23:45,447 --> 00:23:47,313
Matt Cone is your cousin?

392
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:49,182
- Yeah!
- Like a brother to you?

393
00:23:49,184 --> 00:23:51,185
Just tell me
why he's your idol, huh?

394
00:23:51,187 --> 00:23:54,921
- Why do you love him so much?
- He looks like the person

395
00:23:54,923 --> 00:23:58,225
who really can sweep me
off my feet.

396
00:23:58,227 --> 00:24:00,994
And I know that
he is as wonderful...

397
00:24:00,996 --> 00:24:04,564
He's as fancy on the inside
as he is on the outside.

398
00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:06,365
Okay. What is it
you want me to do?

399
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:10,303
I want you to try on
some clothes for Travis.

400
00:24:10,305 --> 00:24:15,909
Why don't we try on this
beautiful, handsome, white shirt?

401
00:24:15,911 --> 00:24:17,913
I want to see how
you look in it.

402
00:24:18,948 --> 00:24:20,214
- What the hell is this?
- Come on, David.

403
00:24:20,216 --> 00:24:21,849
This looks kind of gay.
No offense.

404
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:23,583
Travis is bisexual.

405
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:27,987
What? Whoa, whoa.
I'm not gonna play gay.

406
00:24:27,989 --> 00:24:29,523
- I... I'm sorry...
- I think you can.

407
00:24:29,525 --> 00:24:31,490
I like women, you know?

408
00:24:31,492 --> 00:24:35,294
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

409
00:24:35,296 --> 00:24:37,366
This is a man's shirt.

410
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:39,466
Travis is a man.

411
00:24:39,468 --> 00:24:42,305
It says Ann Taylor Loft.

412
00:24:43,471 --> 00:24:45,538
Ann Taylor is the designer.

413
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,341
Yeah, that's a women's designer.

414
00:24:47,343 --> 00:24:50,212
She's the designer.
She doesn't wear the shirt.

415
00:24:51,346 --> 00:24:53,415
The men and the women
will love you. Try it on.

416
00:24:55,617 --> 00:24:58,451
You do realize those people are
weird in there, don't you?

417
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:00,120
Huh? No.

418
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:01,354
No? What do
you mean no?

419
00:25:01,356 --> 00:25:03,489
You don't know that
they're not exactly normal?

420
00:25:03,491 --> 00:25:05,057
Um, no.

421
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:07,093
I mean, do they have you
brainwashed or something?

422
00:25:07,095 --> 00:25:10,130
- What's brainwashed?
- Like, they think for you.

423
00:25:10,132 --> 00:25:11,665
You don't want to be like that.
You want to be normal like me.

424
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:13,436
Aah!

425
00:25:14,636 --> 00:25:17,137
- Sorry. I sneezed.
- Are you okay?

426
00:25:17,139 --> 00:25:20,573
Yeah, it's fine.
It's been a very hot day today.

427
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:23,176
I bet. It's really
hotsy-totsy today.

428
00:25:23,178 --> 00:25:25,344
You don't have to say stuff like that.
It's kind of irritating.

429
00:25:25,346 --> 00:25:29,315
I mean, "hotsy-totsy,"
"sharing is caring."

430
00:25:29,317 --> 00:25:30,516
Yummy in my tummy.

431
00:25:30,518 --> 00:25:31,717
See, there you go again.

432
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:34,487
I mean, why do you say stuff
like that? It's very irritating.

433
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:36,989
So in other words, it rubs
you in the wrong way?

434
00:25:36,991 --> 00:25:38,292
Yeah, that's right.

435
00:25:38,294 --> 00:25:42,094
Meaning, it's not your cup of tea
and it doesn't float your boat?

436
00:25:42,096 --> 00:25:44,031
See, you're doing it again.

437
00:25:44,033 --> 00:25:45,465
You don't want people
to think you're abnormal

438
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:47,333
or anything like that, right?

439
00:25:47,335 --> 00:25:50,670
Like those, uh, people
at that program.

440
00:25:50,672 --> 00:25:52,007
I don't know.

441
00:25:53,109 --> 00:25:56,075
No offense or anything,
but I think you're above them.

442
00:25:56,077 --> 00:25:57,209
What's your problem anyway?

443
00:25:57,211 --> 00:25:59,412
I don't know
what's wrong with you.

444
00:25:59,414 --> 00:26:02,416
Um, well, I have autism.

445
00:26:02,418 --> 00:26:03,386
Is that it?

446
00:26:04,652 --> 00:26:07,987
Um, no. I also have an LD.

447
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:10,090
What is that,
like a venereal thing?

448
00:26:10,092 --> 00:26:11,457
No, it's a learning disability...

449
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:17,331
Oh, huh. Well, I guess
everybody's got problems.

450
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:18,665
That's true.

451
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:20,370
So, what's
your problem, David?

452
00:26:21,336 --> 00:26:22,370
Um, I don't know.

453
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,603
I guess I got a little bit
stressed out this year,

454
00:26:24,605 --> 00:26:27,943
but, uh, you know, I've been
getting better, you know?

455
00:26:39,988 --> 00:26:42,255
Why do you have to go home
so urgently anyhow?

456
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:44,390
How about if I take you out
instead, tonight?

457
00:26:44,392 --> 00:26:47,494
But what will I tell
my grandmother?

458
00:26:47,496 --> 00:26:50,563
Well, if not, then how about
tomorrow night?

459
00:26:50,565 --> 00:26:52,365
Tomorrow is game night.

460
00:26:52,367 --> 00:26:53,400
Thursday?

461
00:26:53,402 --> 00:26:56,436
Thursday, we're going
on a field trip to the zoo.

462
00:26:56,438 --> 00:26:58,604
- How about Friday then?
- Friday is show tunes.

463
00:26:58,606 --> 00:26:59,773
Show tunes?

464
00:26:59,775 --> 00:27:02,344
Yeah, show tunes
is every single Friday.

465
00:27:03,478 --> 00:27:05,344
Every single Friday?

466
00:27:05,346 --> 00:27:08,247
I enjoy it very much,
show tunes.

467
00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:12,220
How about just miss one show tunes?
Just for me?

468
00:27:22,765 --> 00:27:24,531
So I guess I'll see you
this Friday?

469
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:30,006
- This is my bus.
- Yeah, there it is.

470
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:45,584
We're gonna continue today working
with our theme of superheroes.

471
00:27:45,586 --> 00:27:46,652
Sound okay?

472
00:27:46,654 --> 00:27:48,354
Yes! Wonderful!

473
00:27:48,356 --> 00:27:50,657
So, the question I asked
you guys last week,

474
00:27:50,659 --> 00:27:52,525
and I asked you to think
about it a little bit,

475
00:27:52,527 --> 00:27:56,228
was, if you had a superpower,
what would it be?

476
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:00,100
Uh, I guess it would be to...

477
00:28:00,102 --> 00:28:04,838
I guess it would be to... to...

478
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,474
I guess it would be
to let them know

479
00:28:07,476 --> 00:28:10,610
who... the world know
who I really am, you know?

480
00:28:10,612 --> 00:28:12,646
To let the world
know who you really are.

481
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:16,783
But to really express
myself in a variety of ways.

482
00:28:16,785 --> 00:28:19,486
My superpower would be

483
00:28:19,488 --> 00:28:24,557
to get Matt Cone
to fall in love with me

484
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:25,825
and to propose to me.

485
00:28:25,827 --> 00:28:29,428
Matt Cone is kissing me,

486
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,363
our shirts are off,
we're lying down.

487
00:28:32,301 --> 00:28:35,101
His stomach is touching mine.

488
00:28:35,103 --> 00:28:38,405
All right. Let's try
to stay focused, okay?

489
00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:40,439
On the count of three,
I'm gonna ask you guys

490
00:28:40,441 --> 00:28:42,409
to change the way you're
sitting in your chair.

491
00:28:42,411 --> 00:28:46,082
And I want you to think about
how this superhero would sit.

492
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:48,448
You ready?

493
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,182
- Okay, hold on I didn't count to three yet.
- Oh, sorry.

494
00:28:50,184 --> 00:28:56,124
Okay, you ready?
One, two, three.

495
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:59,126
Ooh, careful.

496
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:03,196
Look at all of these
amazing superheroes here.

497
00:29:03,198 --> 00:29:05,133
What incredible characters.

498
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:08,204
David.

499
00:29:09,438 --> 00:29:11,641
If you had a superpower,
what would it be?

500
00:29:14,142 --> 00:29:15,478
I'd be invisible.

501
00:29:18,646 --> 00:29:19,447
Why?

502
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:24,217
So I can go into
the ladies' locker room.

503
00:29:29,624 --> 00:29:31,658
To do this stunt,
takes a lot of confidence.

504
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,497
You all should be confident.

505
00:29:41,769 --> 00:29:43,238
Give him a hand!

506
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:48,909
So a guy walks
into a sex shop and says,

507
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:50,580
"I want an inflatable doll."

508
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:53,880
- And...
- What's an inflatable?

509
00:29:53,882 --> 00:29:55,948
You know, those sex dolls.

510
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,384
You have sex with those
inflatable dolls

511
00:29:58,386 --> 00:30:00,687
that you see
at the Porno Stop.

512
00:30:00,689 --> 00:30:03,790
But, uh... So, he says,

513
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:06,525
"Do you want a male doll or
a female doll to do it with?"

514
00:30:06,527 --> 00:30:09,563
"I want a female doll.
What do you think I'm gay

515
00:30:09,565 --> 00:30:11,531
and I want to do it
with a male doll?"

516
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:14,534
"Okay, do you want a black doll
or a white doll?"

517
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:17,803
"I don't know. I'm not sure.
I guess a white doll."

518
00:30:17,805 --> 00:30:20,372
That's so racist and offensive.

519
00:30:20,374 --> 00:30:22,208
Well, you want to hear it?

520
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,276
It gets even more
racist and offensive.

521
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:25,844
"Do you want
a Jewish inflatable doll,

522
00:30:25,846 --> 00:30:28,881
a Christian inflatable doll,
or a Muslim inflatable doll?"

523
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:29,882
He goes,
"Why do you ask me that?"

524
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:32,521
"Because the Muslims,
they blow themselves up!"

525
00:30:34,422 --> 00:30:36,691
Allah!

526
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:39,959
You don't get it?

527
00:30:39,961 --> 00:30:41,428
No, I don't.

528
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,697
I find it really offensive
and so confusing.

529
00:30:43,699 --> 00:30:46,332
So... So, you know
that girl that said,

530
00:30:46,334 --> 00:30:50,269
"I'm not working during the week because
I have to do camp in Cranford?"

531
00:30:50,271 --> 00:30:53,305
- Right.
- So I go, "Oh, well, I'm Jewish. I don't like to do camp."

532
00:30:53,307 --> 00:30:55,242
Hold on. What camp is this?

533
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:56,775
I don't know. I think
it's a concentration...

534
00:30:58,613 --> 00:31:00,380
I'm just kidding.

535
00:31:00,382 --> 00:31:01,784
That's not funny.

536
00:31:02,784 --> 00:31:04,883
Uh, I need to concentrate.

537
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:08,021
Right. So, what camp is this?

538
00:31:08,023 --> 00:31:09,589
Um, I'm not sure.

539
00:31:09,591 --> 00:31:10,657
Okay.

540
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:13,025
But I go,

541
00:31:13,027 --> 00:31:16,362
"I don't like to go
to no camps. I'm Jewish."

542
00:31:16,364 --> 00:31:19,299
- Well, I'm... Well, you know what, David? I'm Jewish...
- I'm Jewish too.

543
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:20,633
But I've been to sleep-away camp
and I've performed

544
00:31:20,635 --> 00:31:23,335
in a lot of musical theater
productions and plays...

545
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:25,738
Oh, it was a stupid joke
I said. I'm sorry...

546
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,874
Can you give me a time to ask
you, maybe, what the joke means?

547
00:31:28,876 --> 00:31:30,909
I'll explain the joke.
I mean, I'll explain the joke.

548
00:31:30,911 --> 00:31:32,911
Because... so I don't have to...

549
00:31:32,913 --> 00:31:34,480
Words can have
multiple meanings.

550
00:31:34,482 --> 00:31:36,382
It's like... yeah, there
were multiple meanings.

551
00:31:36,384 --> 00:31:37,851
Just like with, uh...

552
00:31:37,853 --> 00:31:39,919
Maybe when there's a pause, I can
ask you for clarification...

553
00:31:39,921 --> 00:31:41,321
- Words...
- Wait. Don't interrupt me.

554
00:31:41,323 --> 00:31:44,357
- I can ask you for clarification.
- I didn't mean to interrupt. I'm sorry.

555
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,891
I'm getting nervous.
I didn't mean to interrupt...

556
00:31:45,893 --> 00:31:48,294
Maybe when there's a pause to ask
you so I know what it means.

557
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:49,996
I need specifics.

558
00:31:49,998 --> 00:31:51,363
I only said it
to make you laugh,

559
00:31:51,365 --> 00:31:52,799
not to make you argue with me.

560
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:53,766
It sounds like "Who's on first."

561
00:31:53,768 --> 00:31:55,735
I don't want to hear
"Who's on First."

562
00:31:55,737 --> 00:31:59,038
I just... All I care about
is understanding your jokes.

563
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,373
Sarah, I made a boo-boo, okay?

564
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:03,476
It's not you. It's me.

565
00:32:03,478 --> 00:32:06,780
You know, I didn't mean
to annoy you just now, okay?

566
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,572
- How you doing? Chicken and rice.
- David.

567
00:32:32,574 --> 00:32:34,807
- Hey.
- I have an opportunity

568
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:37,646
- that I think you'll appreciate as a gay man.
- Thank you.

569
00:32:39,014 --> 00:32:40,112
What?

570
00:32:40,114 --> 00:32:41,948
Uh, lamb gyro, please.

571
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,552
Dude, I'm not gay.

572
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,353
- What?
- Sorry. I'm not gay.

573
00:32:47,355 --> 00:32:49,054
Thank you.

574
00:32:49,056 --> 00:32:50,823
But you have
such gay mannerisms.

575
00:32:50,825 --> 00:32:52,524
You're so artsy.

576
00:32:52,526 --> 00:32:57,697
You're so suave and you seem
to flirt with all the guys.

577
00:32:57,699 --> 00:33:02,468
How would you and Matt like
to come to our exclusive club

578
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,103
of show tunes on Friday?

579
00:33:04,105 --> 00:33:05,971
I can't this Friday.
I have plans.

580
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:07,442
Cancel them.

581
00:33:08,576 --> 00:33:11,611
Nah. I'm supposed
to see Sarah that day.

582
00:33:11,613 --> 00:33:13,582
Sarah is gonna be
at show tunes.

583
00:33:14,649 --> 00:33:15,982
She can't get out of it
this Friday?

584
00:33:15,984 --> 00:33:17,617
She can't ever.

585
00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:21,454
She is the star. She's the diva.
She's the songbird.

586
00:33:21,456 --> 00:33:22,688
She provides the music.

587
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,593
Without her,
there'd be no music.

588
00:33:25,594 --> 00:33:26,993
Well, I gotta see
Sarah that day.

589
00:33:26,995 --> 00:33:29,461
I mean, we had plans,
you know?

590
00:33:29,463 --> 00:33:33,032
I mean, to go out on a date.
She's my girlfriend.

591
00:33:33,034 --> 00:33:34,133
What?

592
00:33:34,135 --> 00:33:35,735
Yeah, she's my girlfriend.

593
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:39,805
Oh, my God. You know what then?
Never mind.

594
00:33:39,807 --> 00:33:41,707
Don't come to show tunes.
It's okay.

595
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:44,476
Forget I ever said anything.
Don't come to show tunes.

596
00:33:44,478 --> 00:33:47,746
Wait, wait. What the hell? You just
offered me and then you take it away?

597
00:33:47,748 --> 00:33:50,784
- No, it's okay. I changed my mind.
- I gotta see Sarah that day.

598
00:33:50,786 --> 00:33:53,922
You can see Sarah another day.
Please don't come to show tunes.

599
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:56,925
Why not?

600
00:33:57,758 --> 00:33:59,627
Why not?

601
00:34:04,132 --> 00:34:05,500
How much?

602
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:08,066
$12.

603
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:09,404
There you go.

604
00:34:10,605 --> 00:34:12,071
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

605
00:34:12,073 --> 00:34:13,642
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

606
00:34:26,821 --> 00:34:30,656
Your turn, Zach,
if that's your real name.

607
00:34:30,658 --> 00:34:34,127
Uh, how about something
from <i>Les Mis.</i>

608
00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:35,728
Could we please
do something else?

609
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:36,895
We hear it all
the time from Sarah.

610
00:34:36,897 --> 00:34:38,964
- How about a song from <i>Cats?</i>
- Which version?

611
00:34:38,966 --> 00:34:40,732
Can it be the same one?

612
00:34:40,734 --> 00:34:44,536
I'd prefer it wasn't. We like
some variety in this thing.

613
00:34:44,538 --> 00:34:46,806
Zach, could you
pick something else?

614
00:34:46,808 --> 00:34:48,741
- No...
- It's up to him, Sammy...

615
00:34:48,743 --> 00:34:50,946
All right.
Your turn, hippy guy.

616
00:34:52,513 --> 00:34:55,647
My name is Dylan.
Don't call me that ever again.

617
00:34:55,649 --> 00:34:57,951
Well, it's your pick.

618
00:34:57,953 --> 00:35:01,556
- "The Acid Queen."
- Great song, but not a show tune.

619
00:35:14,669 --> 00:35:17,971
How about, um, "Paradox"

620
00:35:17,973 --> 00:35:21,107
or "When You Had Left Your Pirate
Fold" from <i>Pirates of Penzance?</i>

621
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:22,641
You always pick that one,

622
00:35:22,643 --> 00:35:27,580
but the game requires me
to indulge you.

623
00:35:41,596 --> 00:35:42,731
David?

624
00:35:43,297 --> 00:35:44,630
Hey, everybody.

625
00:35:44,632 --> 00:35:46,468
What are you doing here?

626
00:35:47,736 --> 00:35:49,071
I told you not to come.

627
00:35:52,306 --> 00:35:53,942
I gotta give this to you.

628
00:35:56,176 --> 00:35:58,810
Wow, you look great.

629
00:35:58,812 --> 00:36:00,746
I mean,
you look great in red too.

630
00:36:00,748 --> 00:36:02,884
I love the red dress,
by the way, you know.

631
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,554
I was figuring maybe you
wanna get together later,

632
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:09,154
after this thing, you know.

633
00:36:09,156 --> 00:36:10,492
Go out somewhere to eat?

634
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:18,533
Why... Why aren't you happy to see me?

635
00:36:20,768 --> 00:36:23,870
David, I know how
smokin' hot and sexy you are,

636
00:36:23,872 --> 00:36:26,172
but this is not
the right time and the place

637
00:36:26,174 --> 00:36:28,007
to be having this conversation.

638
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:30,079
We're not gonna
discuss it here any further.

639
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,587
So, what exactly is it
that you do, David?

640
00:36:39,353 --> 00:36:40,723
I'm a filmmaker.

641
00:36:41,355 --> 00:36:42,688
Uh-huh.

642
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,656
I have
a project in the works.

643
00:36:44,658 --> 00:36:49,261
Let me guess. You still
live with your parents.

644
00:36:49,263 --> 00:36:51,897
Never earned a nickel
in your life

645
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:53,333
and never actually
make films,

646
00:36:53,335 --> 00:36:55,301
just talk about making them.

647
00:36:55,303 --> 00:36:58,370
Am I on point here so far?

648
00:36:58,372 --> 00:37:00,607
I'm a legit filmmaker.

649
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:02,875
I have a film
which is in consideration

650
00:37:02,877 --> 00:37:05,011
of the Palm Beach
International Film Festival.

651
00:37:05,013 --> 00:37:07,746
Here, take a look at this.
My movie.

652
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:26,833
Please take that thing
out of my face.

653
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:29,301
A bunch of random home movies
strung together

654
00:37:29,303 --> 00:37:30,772
in no aesthetic order.

655
00:37:31,973 --> 00:37:35,942
So, Sarah, my darling,
it is your turn.

656
00:37:35,944 --> 00:37:37,976
Why don't you ever let me sing?

657
00:37:37,978 --> 00:37:42,151
As my girlfriend,
Sarah has special privileges.

658
00:37:45,252 --> 00:37:48,056
Now sing,
my beautiful songbird.

659
00:37:52,093 --> 00:37:57,996
<i>♪ Let me call you sweetheart ♪</i>

660
00:37:57,998 --> 00:38:00,199
Magnificent. Brava!

661
00:38:00,201 --> 00:38:03,136
Sarah and Will are a couple?

662
00:38:03,138 --> 00:38:04,739
Let me explain.

663
00:38:06,274 --> 00:38:07,643
Sarah...

664
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:13,946
is basically a player
or a "man-izer."

665
00:38:13,948 --> 00:38:14,913
Whoa.

666
00:38:14,915 --> 00:38:16,748
This is part of her nature.

667
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:20,219
She said she really likes me,
that I'm the cat's meow.

668
00:38:20,221 --> 00:38:23,755
She also describes
the Holocaust as "a bummer."

669
00:38:23,757 --> 00:38:25,761
Can you understand
this about her?

670
00:38:26,261 --> 00:38:27,726
Yeah.

671
00:38:27,728 --> 00:38:30,698
Don't expect anything
other than dates and sex.

672
00:38:35,035 --> 00:38:37,772
Can we play the title song
of <i>Anything Goes?</i>

673
00:38:57,926 --> 00:39:00,025
Help a brother out, man?

674
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:02,261
Get that fuckin' thing
out of my face!

675
00:39:02,263 --> 00:39:05,998
It's not my fault you fucked your
life up, you fucking asshole!

676
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,969
Fuck you, you bum!
Fuck you!

677
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:11,837
Chill out, dude.

678
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,142
Shut the fuck up!

679
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:17,342
Okay, Sarah. Zach.

680
00:39:17,344 --> 00:39:20,045
Now, we did scene three before.

681
00:39:20,047 --> 00:39:22,380
Now, we're gonna
try it without scripts.

682
00:39:22,382 --> 00:39:25,451
That being said,
Zach, same thing.

683
00:39:25,453 --> 00:39:27,319
Butt naked would be best.

684
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:30,223
- If you...
- All my clothes are staying on...

685
00:39:30,225 --> 00:39:31,824
Then that is fine.

686
00:39:31,826 --> 00:39:33,826
- To him directly?
- Yes.

687
00:39:33,828 --> 00:39:36,362
Oh, Travis, I'm so impressed
you came to me...

688
00:39:36,364 --> 00:39:37,830
- Sarah!
- What?

689
00:39:37,832 --> 00:39:38,931
You don't know his name.

690
00:39:38,933 --> 00:39:40,799
No, just say it
without the name?

691
00:39:40,801 --> 00:39:42,000
Say it without the name.

692
00:39:42,002 --> 00:39:45,337
Oh, my God. I'm so
impressed you came to me.

693
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:48,406
The joy of my life! It makes me...
I'm so thrilled.

694
00:39:48,408 --> 00:39:50,475
- Sarah.
- What?

695
00:39:50,477 --> 00:39:52,310
Do you tell him
how you feel right away?

696
00:39:52,312 --> 00:39:53,281
No.

697
00:39:56,551 --> 00:39:58,518
Why you didn't tell me
you had a boyfriend?

698
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,353
What do you mean?

699
00:40:00,355 --> 00:40:01,554
Exactly what I meant.

700
00:40:01,556 --> 00:40:03,759
Why you didn't tell me
you had a boyfriend?

701
00:40:06,261 --> 00:40:09,828
Well, I don't know how you felt
about open relationships...

702
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:13,399
Oh! Open relationships?
This is what you call this?

703
00:40:13,401 --> 00:40:19,205
David, I still need to... I need to
still properly smooth you out here.

704
00:40:19,207 --> 00:40:22,808
I mean, what you
don't understand is,

705
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,277
there's so much
fish out there in the sea.

706
00:40:25,279 --> 00:40:27,580
And you let all these fish,
uh, touch you.

707
00:40:27,582 --> 00:40:31,551
No, it's just, all these men who
are on top of me, all over me...

708
00:40:31,553 --> 00:40:32,888
Oh, my God.

709
00:40:34,154 --> 00:40:35,420
Or on my lap.

710
00:40:35,422 --> 00:40:38,591
What? Am I hearing right?

711
00:40:38,593 --> 00:40:40,493
They sit on your lap
and all that?

712
00:40:40,495 --> 00:40:42,161
My God.

713
00:40:42,163 --> 00:40:45,565
Okay, I'm gonna use a really,
really ugly word right now.

714
00:40:45,567 --> 00:40:46,899
I'm not ugly.

715
00:40:46,901 --> 00:40:48,433
I didn't say you were ugly.

716
00:40:48,435 --> 00:40:51,237
I said I'm using an ugly word.

717
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:53,909
Does the word "promiscuous"
mean anything to you?

718
00:40:54,442 --> 00:40:56,174
No.

719
00:40:56,176 --> 00:40:59,879
It means that these men
do not respect you,

720
00:40:59,881 --> 00:41:01,817
that they just want you
for one thing.

721
00:41:03,884 --> 00:41:06,919
Right in the spur
of the moment,

722
00:41:06,921 --> 00:41:10,957
I feel as though you're putting a lot of
social and emotional pressure right now to me.

723
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:15,998
When was the last time Will actually
included you in a conversation, huh?

724
00:41:20,033 --> 00:41:22,400
See? I'm not pressuring you.

725
00:41:22,402 --> 00:41:23,969
You do what you want to.

726
00:41:23,971 --> 00:41:27,176
I'm not gonna force you
to be my girlfriend.

727
00:41:31,346 --> 00:41:32,414
Whatever.

728
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:50,663
Sarah and David,
you had some homework, right?

729
00:41:50,665 --> 00:41:53,869
You went to the Brooklyn Bridge?
How was it?

730
00:41:55,937 --> 00:41:57,636
It's kind of irritating.

731
00:41:57,638 --> 00:41:59,440
Okay. Irritating how?

732
00:42:01,442 --> 00:42:04,847
Sarah, what about you? What did
you think of the Brooklyn Bridge?

733
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:09,047
Well, to be very honest
with you, Dorsey,

734
00:42:09,049 --> 00:42:15,120
um, even though David found it really
irritating to focus on the positive,

735
00:42:15,122 --> 00:42:17,390
I had a wonderful time.

736
00:42:17,392 --> 00:42:19,257
Terrific memories there.

737
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:22,127
- Can anybody else relate to that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

738
00:42:22,129 --> 00:42:28,634
I don't envy anybody, you know,
as far as...

739
00:42:28,636 --> 00:42:31,373
But sometimes...

740
00:42:33,207 --> 00:42:35,074
This is what I'll do is...

741
00:42:35,076 --> 00:42:38,611
<i>♪ I'm as horny
As Kansas in August ♪</i>

742
00:42:40,348 --> 00:42:42,248
<i>♪ Someone's in the kitchen
With... ♪</i>

743
00:42:52,593 --> 00:42:54,263
Are you getting in, Mr. Cohen?

744
00:43:11,212 --> 00:43:13,315
W-What about your friends?

745
00:43:29,129 --> 00:43:31,132
<i>One, two...</i>

746
00:43:32,366 --> 00:43:34,135
Ah! Be angry!

747
00:43:34,768 --> 00:43:36,337
Woo!

748
00:43:36,738 --> 00:43:38,237
Wow.

749
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:40,038
- Yay!
- One more for good luck!

750
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,109
You gonna kiss your boyfriend?

751
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,478
What about you, girl?

752
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,116
- I don't know how.
- Here, use this, use this.

753
00:43:48,716 --> 00:43:50,348
I just felt like watching.

754
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:53,419
I have very severe
diet restrictions to gluten.

755
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:55,620
I wanna make sure
there's no gluten.

756
00:43:55,622 --> 00:43:58,491
I just wanna make it absolutely
very, very crystal clear.

757
00:43:58,493 --> 00:44:01,761
And if it has no gluten, I would
really love the lobster salad.

758
00:44:01,763 --> 00:44:04,129
Does mayonnaise
have gluten in it? No.

759
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:06,132
All right. Okay, yeah.

760
00:44:06,134 --> 00:44:08,533
Look at this. This is fun.

761
00:44:11,272 --> 00:44:14,806
It doesn't have to necessarily be
on the beach, David, you know?

762
00:44:14,808 --> 00:44:16,475
Well, this is what
the beach is about.

763
00:44:16,477 --> 00:44:19,511
David, I just really don't
like the sand on my feet. It...

764
00:44:19,513 --> 00:44:22,214
Come on. I just want
to hold your hand.

765
00:44:22,216 --> 00:44:23,815
Can't we do something else?

766
00:44:23,817 --> 00:44:25,650
Like mix and match
and explore a variety...

767
00:44:25,652 --> 00:44:28,788
What do you want to do Sarah? Okay?
What do you want to do? Okay?

768
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,656
- What I want to do David, so badly...
- We're in Coney Island here.

769
00:44:31,658 --> 00:44:34,192
There's like a million things to do here.
What do you want to do?

770
00:44:34,194 --> 00:44:35,328
- Oh, my God.
- What is this ride?

771
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:37,663
- Uh!
- David, look! Look at this.

772
00:44:37,665 --> 00:44:39,397
I love...
This looks so exciting.

773
00:44:39,399 --> 00:44:41,433
- Look at the one right here! Look!
- Uh!

774
00:44:41,435 --> 00:44:45,203
David, sweetheart, this looks
so exciting and tantalizing.

775
00:44:45,205 --> 00:44:48,107
It looks like the strings are gonna break.

776
00:44:48,109 --> 00:44:49,275
I don't want
you to get hurt.

777
00:44:49,277 --> 00:44:51,143
We won't get hurt.
You'll protect me.

778
00:44:51,145 --> 00:44:53,348
I want to go
on that with you.

779
00:44:55,616 --> 00:44:58,250
I just figured
you'd like the teacups,

780
00:44:58,252 --> 00:45:01,152
the horsey rides, the boats.

781
00:45:01,154 --> 00:45:03,489
Perfect for a lady like you,
you know?

782
00:45:03,491 --> 00:45:06,292
I don't want to go on the baby rides.
I've aged out of those stages.

783
00:45:06,294 --> 00:45:07,359
Do you want to go
on the sling ride?

784
00:45:07,361 --> 00:45:10,562
- Where's the sling ride?
- Look at it, up in the air.

785
00:45:10,564 --> 00:45:12,598
- The boat rides are still not appropriate for my...
- Okay.

786
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,500
The boat rides
are still very babyish.

787
00:45:14,502 --> 00:45:18,136
We can always go on the horsey ride,
you know, like the merry-go-round?

788
00:45:18,138 --> 00:45:19,605
Everybody goes
on the merry-go-round.

789
00:45:19,607 --> 00:45:22,540
- Everyone of all ages. It's not just for babies...
- Okay.

790
00:45:22,542 --> 00:45:24,445
- Okay, I trust you on that. We'll do that.
- Okay.

791
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:45,797
What's wrong?
Don't you want a horse?

792
00:45:45,799 --> 00:45:47,602
No, horses are not for men.

793
00:45:48,602 --> 00:45:49,537
All right.

794
00:46:10,625 --> 00:46:12,561
Whoo-hoo!

795
00:46:13,761 --> 00:46:16,629
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

796
00:46:18,299 --> 00:46:21,369
I'm having a blast, David. Whoo!

797
00:46:23,803 --> 00:46:25,639
Whoo!

798
00:46:27,507 --> 00:46:28,641
Whoo-hoo!

799
00:46:28,643 --> 00:46:30,942
Aah!

800
00:46:32,446 --> 00:46:33,946
Sorry.
It's my allergies.

801
00:46:33,948 --> 00:46:36,384
Aah!

802
00:46:37,652 --> 00:46:39,451
Aah!

803
00:46:39,453 --> 00:46:40,689
Aah!

804
00:46:46,893 --> 00:46:49,397
It's okay. It's okay.

805
00:46:53,834 --> 00:46:55,169
Aah!

806
00:46:57,437 --> 00:46:59,837
Aah!

807
00:47:24,998 --> 00:47:27,435
Aah!

808
00:47:31,571 --> 00:47:33,240
Aah!

809
00:47:37,712 --> 00:47:39,347
Aah!

810
00:47:52,426 --> 00:47:55,594
Uh, about that thing,
the horsey ride.

811
00:47:55,596 --> 00:48:00,498
I just got real sick, that's
all, but I'm okay now, you know?

812
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:04,205
I mean, uh, I'm not contagious
or anything like...

813
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,777
Sarah, look at me.
I'm okay.

814
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:15,584

been getting better.

You're just
gonna love it.

00:50:59,913 --> 00:51:03,614
Hey, Matt, it's David.
Um, we just saw your show.

842
00:51:03,616 --> 00:51:06,551
Um, we're still at the theater,
so I don't know what to do.

843
00:51:06,553 --> 00:51:08,520
You wanna meet us
at the restaurant?

844
00:51:08,522 --> 00:51:10,489
Is there anything I can
help you with though?

845
00:51:10,491 --> 00:51:11,790
No, I don't really
need anything.

846
00:51:11,792 --> 00:51:16,495
I wanna know what your hobbies are.
What are you passionate about?

847
00:51:16,497 --> 00:51:18,062
I don't...
I don't have hobbies.

848
00:51:18,064 --> 00:51:20,933
I just... I just work.

849
00:51:20,935 --> 00:51:23,634
Oh. What are you so passionate
about working in the theater?

850
00:51:23,636 --> 00:51:26,138
What do you love
about it so much?

851
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:27,473
Nothing.

852
00:51:27,475 --> 00:51:29,944
I don't love
anything about it.

853
00:51:30,977 --> 00:51:32,946
Please give me a call, okay?

854
00:51:34,247 --> 00:51:35,681
- Hi.
- Hey.

855
00:51:35,683 --> 00:51:37,683
We're not exactly asking
for autographs.

856
00:51:37,685 --> 00:51:39,551
Have you, uh,
seen Matt Cone?

857
00:51:39,553 --> 00:51:41,853
I just work the door.
I'm just security.

858
00:51:41,855 --> 00:51:45,656
If I show my ticket stubs, can I go in?
I really gotta see him.

859
00:51:45,658 --> 00:51:47,058
You can't go
in here.

860
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,194
Well, they do come out
here, the actors, right?

861
00:51:50,196 --> 00:51:52,563
I'm not asking
for any trouble.

862
00:51:52,565 --> 00:51:54,565
I'm not a bad person
or anything. I just...

863
00:51:54,567 --> 00:51:56,835
You're not getting any trouble.
There's no trouble.

864
00:51:56,837 --> 00:51:58,569
You just can't go
in this door.

865
00:51:58,571 --> 00:51:59,837
He's my cousin, you know?

866
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,074
I don't care
who your cousin is

867
00:52:02,076 --> 00:52:04,775
or your brother or your
uncle, your grandmother.

868
00:52:04,777 --> 00:52:05,844
I don't care.

869
00:52:05,846 --> 00:52:07,779
I feel like you're
angry at the world.

870
00:52:07,781 --> 00:52:09,915
Why don't you just
lighten up, you know?

871
00:52:09,917 --> 00:52:11,516
I'll tell you a joke.

872
00:52:11,518 --> 00:52:14,752
Shia LaBeouf was in the car
with Lindsay Lohan.

873
00:52:14,754 --> 00:52:17,255
Do you know who was driving?

874
00:52:17,257 --> 00:52:18,725
The cops.

875
00:52:20,593 --> 00:52:22,729
You trying to get hurt?
You wanna get hurt tonight?

876
00:52:25,799 --> 00:52:28,866
Being up so late,
it's gorgeous.

877
00:52:28,868 --> 00:52:31,004
Well, hurry up.
The light. The light.

878
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,274
David, it's
so deserted here.

879
00:52:35,276 --> 00:52:38,743
Like, there's... Like, there's no one.
There's no souls.

880
00:52:38,745 --> 00:52:41,013
- Like, it's practically not even...
- Yeah, nobody here.

881
00:52:41,015 --> 00:52:43,750
Watch out for those bikers.

882
00:52:47,788 --> 00:52:50,589
- Isn't this place great?
- Oh, my God.

883
00:52:50,591 --> 00:52:53,091
You know you're at a good restaurant
when the ambience is beautiful.

884
00:52:53,093 --> 00:52:55,497
- Oh, my God.
- Take a look at the menu.

885
00:52:59,232 --> 00:53:01,833
David, but the language
is so confusing.

886
00:53:01,835 --> 00:53:04,803
- I mean...
- That's because it's Italian. It's another, uh, country.

887
00:53:04,805 --> 00:53:07,038
David, I don't speak any Italian.
It's very confusing.

888
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,339
I don't either.

889
00:53:08,341 --> 00:53:10,074
Just order anything
that sounds pretty.

890
00:53:10,076 --> 00:53:14,279
Under "antipasti,"
there's asparagi di campo,

891
00:53:14,281 --> 00:53:17,015
asparagi olive oil,

892
00:53:17,017 --> 00:53:19,650
foggi montinada.

893
00:53:19,652 --> 00:53:22,219
David, that's so confusing

894
00:53:22,221 --> 00:53:24,989
that I have no idea
what that means.

895
00:53:24,991 --> 00:53:26,292
That's how Italian works,
you know?

896
00:53:26,294 --> 00:53:29,226
Good evening. Hi. My name is Kevin.
I'll be taking care of you.

897
00:53:29,228 --> 00:53:30,495
- Hey, Kevin.
- Good evening, Kevin.

898
00:53:30,497 --> 00:53:32,931
- What's up, Kevin?
- Something for the lovely lady and gentleman?

899
00:53:32,933 --> 00:53:35,199
Well, I just want you to know
I'm expecting two more people.

900
00:53:35,201 --> 00:53:38,036
Oh, great. Well, we do have
some specials tonight.

901
00:53:38,038 --> 00:53:40,871
Mozzarella con funghi.
Scaloppine tutta terra.

902
00:53:40,873 --> 00:53:43,007
- Mmm.
- Farfalle con pollo.

903
00:53:43,009 --> 00:53:45,076
Carciofi. Marsala.

904
00:53:45,078 --> 00:53:47,913
Salmone. That's with
the little white wine sauce.

905
00:53:47,915 --> 00:53:50,915
It sounds so beautiful
and romantic.

906
00:53:50,917 --> 00:53:52,384
See, it sounds like music, Sarah.
It sounds great.

907
00:53:52,386 --> 00:53:55,920
Here, why don't you order whatever you
want, okay? Excuse me for a minute.

908
00:53:55,922 --> 00:53:58,924
Okeydokey artichokey.
Oh, my goodness.

909
00:53:58,926 --> 00:54:01,158
I mean, we're holding
the table for you,

910
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,661
but you wanna meet for drinks
after or something?

911
00:54:03,663 --> 00:54:06,864
<i>Ah, sorry, bud. This
cast party's not letting out.</i>

912
00:54:06,866 --> 00:54:08,966
<i>But it'll be just you and me next time.
I promise.</i>

913
00:54:08,968 --> 00:54:11,737
Yeah, yeah. And Sarah.
You gotta meet this girl.

914
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:15,140
She's beautiful, classy,
and goes crazy about me, Matt.

915
00:54:15,142 --> 00:54:17,708
<i>All right, buddy.
I can't wait to meet her.</i>

916
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:20,679
Yeah, we'll do a double date.

917
00:54:20,681 --> 00:54:24,016
Wow. This is a lot of food.

918
00:54:24,018 --> 00:54:27,152
I'm glad you're getting comfortable here.
How do you like it?

919
00:54:27,154 --> 00:54:29,857
- This is to die from.
- Yeah, it's good, isn't it?

920
00:54:32,393 --> 00:54:34,629
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

921
00:54:35,995 --> 00:54:38,263
Mmm.

922
00:54:38,265 --> 00:54:41,266
And here we are.

923
00:54:41,268 --> 00:54:44,036
- Wow.
- Would you like anything else?

924
00:54:44,038 --> 00:54:47,075
Um, no. I'll just
have the check. Here.

925
00:54:48,841 --> 00:54:50,308
Great.

926
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,877
I've never seen you
so happy before.

927
00:54:51,879 --> 00:54:53,147
Aren't you glad
you came here?

928
00:55:00,286 --> 00:55:02,888
This is a $900 bill.

929
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:04,993
What were you doing there,
traveling Europe?

930
00:55:05,759 --> 00:55:08,159
I met a girl.

931
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:11,862
David, come on. One of the Internet
women, your imaginary girlfriends?

932
00:55:11,864 --> 00:55:13,431
No, this girl's real.

933
00:55:13,433 --> 00:55:15,102
Sure she is.

934
00:55:18,739 --> 00:55:20,141
She wants to marry me.

935
00:55:22,042 --> 00:55:23,241
What?

936
00:55:23,243 --> 00:55:25,210
David, that is not funny.

937
00:55:25,212 --> 00:55:26,814
Where is she from?

938
00:55:29,382 --> 00:55:31,252
From that group?

939
00:55:33,786 --> 00:55:36,120
This is a gold digger.

940
00:55:36,122 --> 00:55:36,955
From now on,

941
00:55:36,957 --> 00:55:38,924
you go to your classes,
you come home.

942
00:55:38,926 --> 00:55:40,125
Look, I'll pay you back.

943
00:55:40,127 --> 00:55:42,797
You couldn't pay me back
for a Life Saver.

944
00:55:45,232 --> 00:55:46,964
It's not the money.

945
00:55:46,966 --> 00:55:49,234
It's where will you be
when we're gone.

946
00:55:49,236 --> 00:55:52,239
Who's gonna take care of you
when Dad and I are gone?

947
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:18,832
Hi.

948
00:56:54,368 --> 00:56:56,167
Sarah.

949
00:56:56,169 --> 00:56:57,569
Hi, Grandma.

950
00:56:57,571 --> 00:56:59,069
Hi. Who's this?

951
00:56:59,071 --> 00:57:02,339
This is my boyfriend,
David Cohen.

952
00:57:02,341 --> 00:57:04,275
- Hi, David.
- How are ya?

953
00:57:04,277 --> 00:57:07,444
Would you like
a tequila?

954
00:57:07,446 --> 00:57:10,549
Uh, no, thanks.
I'm not thirsty.

955
00:57:10,551 --> 00:57:13,284
- But thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

956
00:57:13,286 --> 00:57:14,152
Okay.

957
00:57:14,154 --> 00:57:16,420
- Excuse me. I'm going in.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

958
00:57:16,422 --> 00:57:17,325
Yeah,
it's all right.

959
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:21,493
She's my grandma.

960
00:57:21,495 --> 00:57:22,594
Oh.

961
00:57:22,596 --> 00:57:24,161
She's an alcoholic.

962
00:57:24,163 --> 00:57:25,132
Oh.

963
00:57:39,446 --> 00:57:41,179
There's me
at my bar mitzvah.

964
00:57:41,181 --> 00:57:42,179
Oh.

965
00:57:42,181 --> 00:57:45,252
Yeah. I was
a cute kid back then.

966
00:57:53,259 --> 00:57:55,192
That's my prom date.

967
00:57:55,194 --> 00:57:57,364
I didn't even get
to kiss her.

968
00:57:58,464 --> 00:58:00,065
That's too bad.

969
00:58:00,067 --> 00:58:02,069
Well, that's high school.

970
00:58:53,953 --> 00:58:56,122
<i>Say hi to the camera, David.</i>

971
00:59:17,277 --> 00:59:20,145
So what do you think, huh?
Isn't it great?

972
00:59:20,147 --> 00:59:22,917
I mean, that's my whole
autobiography, you know.

973
00:59:24,216 --> 00:59:28,018
O-Overall, I really,
really loved it. Um...

974
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,386
It's a powerful film.

975
00:59:29,388 --> 00:59:32,690
You have to admit, it is very
creative, don't you think?

976
00:59:32,692 --> 00:59:35,359
Yeah, it's really...

977
00:59:35,361 --> 00:59:41,333
To be very honest with you, I mean,
it's very powerful and very creative.

978
00:59:41,335 --> 00:59:44,234
I really loved it very, very
much overall, except for...

979
00:59:44,236 --> 00:59:46,304
That's right.
It's a work of art.

980
00:59:46,306 --> 00:59:50,308
Yeah, that's what I really loved
about it, for everything,

981
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:54,011
except for the ending, which
was really, really confusing.

982
00:59:54,013 --> 00:59:55,714
But that's the point.

983
00:59:55,716 --> 01:00:00,484
Nobody says when I grow up,
I choose to be that, you know?

984
01:00:00,486 --> 01:00:04,254
And sometimes changes
happen for the worst,

985
01:00:04,256 --> 01:00:08,261
and people just have a sad ending
after that, and that's realistic.

986
01:00:09,495 --> 01:00:11,261
Yuh! Like that.

987
01:00:11,263 --> 01:00:13,565
- You know those tics and all that?
- Yeah, I...

988
01:00:13,567 --> 01:00:15,466
- Those noises that I make?
- I'm perfectly aware of that.

989
01:00:15,468 --> 01:00:18,569
But, David, let me give you
also positive critiques.

990
01:00:18,571 --> 01:00:21,339
What I did really, really love...
your childhood memories.

991
01:00:21,341 --> 01:00:24,275
- Your bar mitzvah and your graduation.
- I know.

992
01:00:24,277 --> 01:00:27,178
They were so rewarding
and so special.

993
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:30,047
- You know my cousin, Matt Cone?
- Yeah.

994
01:00:30,049 --> 01:00:33,150
You know how Sammy always says, "Oh,
Matt Cone this, Matt Cone that.

995
01:00:33,152 --> 01:00:34,652
I want Matt Cone."
You know why?

996
01:00:34,654 --> 01:00:36,788
He's a very, very
important person.

997
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:38,390
He's an actor
and all that.

998
01:00:38,392 --> 01:00:40,658
- A real big-time celebrity.
- Mm-hmm.

999
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:44,194
- He's going to, like, put this in a film festival.
- Mm-hmm.

1000
01:00:44,196 --> 01:00:46,096
Palm Beach International
Film Festival.

1001
01:00:46,098 --> 01:00:47,598
He's gonna open
the door for me,

1002
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:51,636
and I'm gonna catch
my big break in Hollywood.

1003
01:00:51,638 --> 01:00:53,341
- You know?
- Cool.

1004
01:00:55,241 --> 01:00:57,042
Sarah,
can I ask you something?

1005
01:00:57,044 --> 01:00:58,442
Yes, David. Sure.

1006
01:00:58,444 --> 01:01:02,212
I mean, I know
that I seem like a big shot

1007
01:01:02,214 --> 01:01:05,583
driving around town
with my limo driver

1008
01:01:05,585 --> 01:01:09,286
and treating you to all
these nice fancy restaurants.

1009
01:01:09,288 --> 01:01:11,188
It never occurred to you,

1010
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:16,161
"Oh, this kid's just
a total bum with no future.

1011
01:01:16,163 --> 01:01:17,694
He's just a complete bum."

1012
01:01:17,696 --> 01:01:19,464
You don't think
I'm a bum, do you?

1013
01:01:19,466 --> 01:01:22,167
Absolutely not, David.

1014
01:01:22,169 --> 01:01:26,337
I think you're really,
really bright,

1015
01:01:26,339 --> 01:01:28,138
very smart,

1016
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:33,478
really, really a glorious,
hunky, sensational

1017
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:38,549
and just so sexy
and attractive-looking

1018
01:01:38,551 --> 01:01:42,420
to a point that it's
really getting me

1019
01:01:42,422 --> 01:01:48,192
in a very horny and
sexually-arousing mood right now.

1020
01:01:48,194 --> 01:01:50,497
Wow. Oh, my God.
You have your hand on my leg.

1021
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:28,134
That feels
so sexually arousing.

1022
01:02:31,872 --> 01:02:33,339
Oh, God.

1023
01:03:20,187 --> 01:03:21,489
Hi!

1024
01:03:24,857 --> 01:03:25,924
Hi.

1025
01:03:25,926 --> 01:03:28,225
Go, Josh! Go, Josh!

1026
01:03:28,227 --> 01:03:30,795
Go, Josh! Go, Josh!

1027
01:03:30,797 --> 01:03:33,598
Go, Sarah!
Go, Sarah! Go, Sarah!

1028
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,900
Go, Henry! Go, Henry!

1029
01:03:35,902 --> 01:03:39,437
Go, Henry!
Go, Henry!

1030
01:03:39,439 --> 01:03:40,406
Go, Sammy!

1031
01:03:41,774 --> 01:03:43,507
Oh, yeah, baby!

1032
01:03:43,509 --> 01:03:45,810
It's so easy.
It's a piece of cake.

1033
01:03:45,812 --> 01:03:47,645
I'll teach you, David.

1034
01:03:47,647 --> 01:03:48,980
I don't like to dance.

1035
01:03:48,982 --> 01:03:52,353
But I'll teach you. It's a piece of cake.
Come to the dance floor.

1036
01:03:54,888 --> 01:03:56,524
I'll show you
how to dance.

1037
01:03:58,257 --> 01:04:01,161
What about your moves, David?
Show me your moves.

1038
01:04:05,564 --> 01:04:06,598
Yeah!

1039
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,569
Whoo!

1040
01:04:15,007 --> 01:04:16,676
Go, David!

1041
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:47,575
<i>I would like to make
a toast to Sarah and David.</i>

1042
01:04:48,674 --> 01:04:52,609
As somebody
who has dated many men,

1043
01:04:52,611 --> 01:04:58,049
I never thought you would find
love like you did with David.

1044
01:04:58,051 --> 01:05:02,286
You two are really going
to make it as a couple!

1045
01:05:02,288 --> 01:05:03,687
I know it.

1046
01:05:03,689 --> 01:05:05,056
So here is to you.

1047
01:05:05,058 --> 01:05:07,025
To Sarah and David!

1048
01:05:07,027 --> 01:05:09,893
To Sarah and David!

1049
01:05:09,895 --> 01:05:10,995
To Sarah and David.

1050
01:05:10,997 --> 01:05:14,299
It's getting a little
sappy for my taste here.

1051
01:05:14,301 --> 01:05:17,835
When we say "I love you,"

1052
01:05:17,837 --> 01:05:21,772
we're really trying to say
to the other person,

1053
01:05:21,774 --> 01:05:23,574
"I like you enough

1054
01:05:23,576 --> 01:05:26,044
not to wanna rip
your face off

1055
01:05:26,046 --> 01:05:30,315
and feed it to a dog,
feed it to a mongrel."

1056
01:05:30,317 --> 01:05:32,382
That would be
a bummer.

1057
01:05:32,384 --> 01:05:34,384
I don't believe that
for a minute.

1058
01:05:34,386 --> 01:05:37,054
I think you two
will get married

1059
01:05:37,056 --> 01:05:38,790
and Matt and I
will get married,

1060
01:05:38,792 --> 01:05:41,859
and the four of us
are going to be family together

1061
01:05:41,861 --> 01:05:43,328
and friends together.

1062
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:45,330
How can you have friends

1063
01:05:45,332 --> 01:05:49,567
if the person next to you is the
one who's gonna sell you out

1064
01:05:49,569 --> 01:05:52,103
to save his own ass,
you know.

1065
01:05:52,105 --> 01:05:53,437
It would be boring.

1066
01:05:53,439 --> 01:05:55,873
Imagine if you didn't have
someone to nuke.

1067
01:05:55,875 --> 01:05:57,607
Come on, man.

1068
01:05:57,609 --> 01:05:58,975
Do you watch
a lot of Fox News?

1069
01:05:58,977 --> 01:06:01,078
I'm a Fox News junkie.

1070
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:06,783
I like it the way Homer Simpson
likes Duff at Moe's Tavern.

1071
01:06:06,785 --> 01:06:09,087
Do you know what Homer Simpson
said to the drug dealer?

1072
01:06:09,089 --> 01:06:10,821
- No. What?
- What?

1073
01:06:10,823 --> 01:06:12,522
"D'ohpe!"

1074
01:06:12,524 --> 01:06:14,427
Oh, my God.

1075
01:06:15,462 --> 01:06:17,428
- Oh, my God.
- D'ohpe!

1076
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:20,098
You know,
I'm with Nancy Reagan there.

1077
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,400
Ooh!

1078
01:06:22,402 --> 01:06:24,571
Can you pass the potato?

1079
01:06:25,504 --> 01:06:27,504
And the macaroni?

1080
01:06:27,506 --> 01:06:28,973
- Any more chicken cutlets?
- Here you go.

1081
01:06:28,975 --> 01:06:31,042
On your way, you're Russian.

1082
01:06:31,044 --> 01:06:32,976
When you get in, European.

1083
01:06:32,978 --> 01:06:34,112
When you come out,

1084
01:06:34,114 --> 01:06:35,882
you're Finnish.

1085
01:06:37,484 --> 01:06:39,984
What does a soda machine
have in common

1086
01:06:39,986 --> 01:06:41,587
with Monica Lewinsky?

1087
01:06:42,855 --> 01:06:44,725
Both say "insert bill here."

1088
01:06:51,131 --> 01:06:52,129
Oh, let Sarah.

1089
01:06:52,131 --> 01:06:53,864
- No.
- Come on, Sarah.

1090
01:06:53,866 --> 01:06:57,504
- I don't know any jokes.
- The jokes are gluten-free.

1091
01:06:59,471 --> 01:07:02,739
- I don't know any jokes.
- Don't pressure her. Come on, come on, guys.

1092
01:07:02,741 --> 01:07:05,042
- I don't know any jokes.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1093
01:07:05,044 --> 01:07:06,777
I got one. I got one.

1094
01:07:06,779 --> 01:07:09,813
This one got me
into a bit of trouble.

1095
01:07:09,815 --> 01:07:13,750
Why did the Jewish guy divorce
his wife when she became a cop?

1096
01:07:13,752 --> 01:07:15,823
- Why?
- 'Cause Jews cannot eat pork.

1097
01:07:23,029 --> 01:07:27,598
So we've got our showcase
Night to Shine coming up really soon.

1098
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,469
And I also have registration
for the fall semester.

1099
01:07:31,471 --> 01:07:34,571
If anyone wants
to sign up for the fall,

1100
01:07:34,573 --> 01:07:36,574
be sure to register
and write your name down

1101
01:07:36,576 --> 01:07:38,909
because this registration
goes really quickly.

1102
01:07:38,911 --> 01:07:41,846
There's a clipboard going
around this side of the room,

1103
01:07:41,848 --> 01:07:43,980
but I'm gonna start
another one over here.

1104
01:07:43,982 --> 01:07:46,817
Just put your name down, and I
hope to see you in the fall

1105
01:07:46,819 --> 01:07:48,853
so we can have
more fun together.

1106
01:08:13,245 --> 01:08:15,645
I just don't understand
why you're leaving.

1107
01:08:15,647 --> 01:08:18,885
Why aren't you
coming back, David?

1108
01:08:22,956 --> 01:08:24,892
I don't know. I just can't.

1109
01:08:32,866 --> 01:08:34,568
Can I ask you
something, Sarah?

1110
01:08:35,702 --> 01:08:38,636
Do you wanna live
with your grandmother forever?

1111
01:08:38,638 --> 01:08:41,809
I mean, you do wanna grow, right?
You're a grown woman.

1112
01:08:42,876 --> 01:08:44,842
Yeah.

1113
01:08:44,844 --> 01:08:47,848
Don't you wanna have all the
things that normal people have?

1114
01:08:50,148 --> 01:08:51,949
I wanna marry you.

1115
01:08:51,951 --> 01:08:56,023
I don't see myself being
with anyone else but you, Sarah.

1116
01:08:57,590 --> 01:09:01,028
If I had to go to Florida,
would you come with me?

1117
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:08,266
To Florida?

1118
01:09:08,268 --> 01:09:10,735
No, no, no, no.
She can't come to Florida.

1119
01:09:10,737 --> 01:09:15,172
I don't even know this girl, and you
want her to live with us for six months?

1120
01:09:15,174 --> 01:09:16,841
What if she just comes
for the ride

1121
01:09:16,843 --> 01:09:19,744
and she can stay at Aunt
Evelyn's and Uncle Harry's?

1122
01:09:19,746 --> 01:09:21,811
In Boca.

1123
01:09:21,813 --> 01:09:24,548
She's not some girl from
some crazy house though.

1124
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:28,285
She really has it together
and she's beautiful,

1125
01:09:28,287 --> 01:09:29,920
and she's Jewish too, Mom.

1126
01:09:29,922 --> 01:09:34,862
You'd love her so much, you'd probably want
her to be your daughter-in-law one day.

1127
01:09:36,662 --> 01:09:40,231
Maybe...
Maybe someday we'll meet her,

1128
01:09:40,233 --> 01:09:43,334
but-but we don't
bring people to Florida,

1129
01:09:43,336 --> 01:09:45,602
especially people
that we don't know.

1130
01:09:45,604 --> 01:09:48,905
Okay? That dad and I haven't met, so...

1131
01:09:48,907 --> 01:09:53,643
Okay. Well, what if I told you she's
upstairs right now in my bedroom?

1132
01:09:53,645 --> 01:09:56,517
I invited her
for the weekend.

1133
01:10:09,795 --> 01:10:10,863
Hmm.

1134
01:10:13,632 --> 01:10:15,333
Look, this has
no gluten in it.

1135
01:10:15,335 --> 01:10:17,067
It's very good.
It's very healthy.

1136
01:10:17,069 --> 01:10:19,169
Wow. it looks really delicious
and yummy in the tummy.

1137
01:10:19,171 --> 01:10:20,804
Potatoes. Beets.

1138
01:10:20,806 --> 01:10:22,272
Here, try this. Try it.

1139
01:10:22,274 --> 01:10:24,642
- Tell me what you think of this.
- Mmm.

1140
01:10:24,644 --> 01:10:27,143
Oh, I love it.
It's absolutely delicious.

1141
01:10:27,145 --> 01:10:30,616
Groovalicious and really
yummy in the tummy.

1142
01:10:35,321 --> 01:10:38,688
So, Sarah,
how did you two meet?

1143
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:42,258
Oh, well, Carrie,
that's a great question.

1144
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:44,628
Um, David and I...
us two met

1145
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:48,932
uh, a place called
the Jewish Community Center.

1146
01:10:48,934 --> 01:10:51,235
- And I found the perfect one, right here.
- Mm-hmm.

1147
01:10:51,237 --> 01:10:56,042
It was a dream come true. It
was very romantic and sexual.

1148
01:10:56,876 --> 01:10:57,941
It was what?

1149
01:10:57,943 --> 01:11:00,177
I mean, Mom, Dad, you see
how happy I am, you know?

1150
01:11:00,179 --> 01:11:02,646
Sarah is the most amazing thing
that ever happened to me.

1151
01:11:02,648 --> 01:11:04,850
She's the one for me.

1152
01:11:06,251 --> 01:11:10,087
How long did it take to realize
that this was the one?

1153
01:11:10,089 --> 01:11:12,856
We met over a month ago,
but officially,

1154
01:11:12,858 --> 01:11:16,060
- we've been going out for roughly two weeks.
- Mm-hmm.

1155
01:11:16,062 --> 01:11:17,727
We've been dating.

1156
01:11:17,729 --> 01:11:19,362
- Two weeks?
- Yes.

1157
01:11:19,364 --> 01:11:20,731
Mm-hmm.

1158
01:11:20,733 --> 01:11:22,799
- Mm-hmm. That's 14 days.
- Yeah.

1159
01:11:22,801 --> 01:11:24,638
Half a month.

1160
01:11:32,979 --> 01:11:35,146
If you have any questions,
you know what to do, okay?

1161
01:11:35,148 --> 01:11:36,880
Don't worry about
trying to understand.

1162
01:11:36,882 --> 01:11:38,682
Just follow the leader.

1163
01:11:38,684 --> 01:11:40,418
That's right.
Follow the leader. Okay?

1164
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:42,919
Just pretend you're interested
in what they have to say.

1165
01:11:42,921 --> 01:11:44,754
If they laugh, you laugh.

1166
01:11:44,756 --> 01:11:47,391
If they look serious,
you look serious. Okay?

1167
01:11:47,393 --> 01:11:50,761
In other words, I will try
my best to lighten my load,

1168
01:11:50,763 --> 01:11:52,797
take a chill pill
and have a wonderful time.

1169
01:11:52,799 --> 01:11:55,432
Yeah, we just need to
chill out tonight, okay?

1170
01:11:55,434 --> 01:11:57,834
In other words,
get the lay of the land,

1171
01:11:57,836 --> 01:12:00,271
cool ourselves off
and have a wonderful time.

1172
01:12:00,273 --> 01:12:03,307
You don't even have to say that. Just
say, "Yeah, okay, cool. That's great."

1173
01:12:03,309 --> 01:12:06,142
Okay, cool, take a chill pill,
lighten our loads, take it easy...

1174
01:12:06,144 --> 01:12:07,811
You know that saying,
"less is more"?

1175
01:12:07,813 --> 01:12:09,312
- I remember perfectly, David.
- Yes.

1176
01:12:09,314 --> 01:12:13,883
Uncle Jimmy. How are you?
This is my girlfriend, Sarah.

1177
01:12:13,885 --> 01:12:15,319
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah.

1178
01:12:15,321 --> 01:12:17,157
Holy moly.
Let me get a look.

1179
01:12:18,224 --> 01:12:20,391
Perfect.

1180
01:12:20,393 --> 01:12:23,163
What did the duck
say to the bartender?

1181
01:12:24,263 --> 01:12:26,097
- Come on.
- Here we go again.

1182
01:12:26,099 --> 01:12:27,298
It's okay.

1183
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,899
Um, what?

1184
01:12:28,901 --> 01:12:31,171
Put it on my bill. Ha!

1185
01:12:35,174 --> 01:12:36,943
Multiple meanings!

1186
01:12:38,478 --> 01:12:41,244
Hi. Oh, how lovely
to meet you.

1187
01:12:41,246 --> 01:12:44,181
I'm Sarah Silverstein,
David Cohen's girlfriend.

1188
01:12:44,183 --> 01:12:47,485
And I love being a performing artist,
singing, acting and working with...

1189
01:12:47,487 --> 01:12:50,788
Let me ask you this,
Aunt Jessica.

1190
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:53,524
Or what about you?
Um, what's your name?

1191
01:12:53,526 --> 01:12:57,831
What are your passions and careers
that you guys like to do for fun?

1192
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:01,766
Well, we, uh...
we love artwork.

1193
01:13:01,768 --> 01:13:03,834
We like to go
to art shows,

1194
01:13:03,836 --> 01:13:05,835
and we like to travel.

1195
01:13:05,837 --> 01:13:08,505
What kind of art shows
do you guys like?

1196
01:13:08,507 --> 01:13:10,473
We go to a lot
of craft shows.

1197
01:13:10,475 --> 01:13:11,978
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

1198
01:13:14,947 --> 01:13:18,115
It's a really
great pleasure to meet you.

1199
01:13:18,117 --> 01:13:19,383
What a blessing.

1200
01:13:19,385 --> 01:13:21,285
I really love
your outfit too.

1201
01:13:21,287 --> 01:13:23,521
I love the color pink.
It's my second favorite color.

1202
01:13:23,523 --> 01:13:26,323
Thank you.
You're very interesting.

1203
01:13:26,325 --> 01:13:30,096
Thank you. It was
a pleasure meeting you too.

1204
01:13:33,232 --> 01:13:36,100
- I mean, boy, you really love those garnishes.
- Yeah.

1205
01:13:36,102 --> 01:13:38,268
Down the hatch-a-roonie
it goes.

1206
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:39,404
Yep.

1207
01:13:39,406 --> 01:13:43,140
Mmm. I tasted it.
It was so yummy in the tummy.

1208
01:13:43,142 --> 01:13:46,442
Didn't you have enough
to eat, sweetheart?

1209
01:13:46,444 --> 01:13:47,913
Um...

1210
01:13:49,514 --> 01:13:50,548
- Right?
- I'm fine.

1211
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:51,882
Everybody's okay.

1212
01:13:51,884 --> 01:13:53,883
I'm perfectly fine.

1213
01:13:56,087 --> 01:13:58,090
We really had a great time.

1214
01:14:00,827 --> 01:14:02,426
Did he ever tell you
any of his jokes?

1215
01:14:02,428 --> 01:14:04,494
Oh, many, many times
in the past.

1216
01:14:04,496 --> 01:14:06,396
They're a bit
very confusing.

1217
01:14:06,398 --> 01:14:09,066
It took me a lot of time to
process and understand them.

1218
01:14:09,068 --> 01:14:11,201
- Two Jews walk into a bar.
- Right.

1219
01:14:11,203 --> 01:14:12,369
They buy it.

1220
01:14:15,041 --> 01:14:16,574
You know
why he cracks me up?

1221
01:14:16,576 --> 01:14:18,342
I don't know.

1222
01:14:23,114 --> 01:14:24,848
I love your song.
It was wonderful.

1223
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:26,549
- What?
- I love your song.

1224
01:14:26,551 --> 01:14:29,285
- What's the name of that song? "The Sun..."
- <i>♪ The sun goes ♪</i>

1225
01:14:29,287 --> 01:14:31,856
- Thank you.
- We have to clear out the boathouse for Matt.

1226
01:14:31,858 --> 01:14:32,923
- Oh.
- Matt's here?

1227
01:14:32,925 --> 01:14:34,057
In the boathouse.

1228
01:14:34,059 --> 01:14:36,062
My cousin Matt.
Remember Matt Cone?

1229
01:14:42,602 --> 01:14:44,602
- Ladies first.
- Thank you.

1230
01:14:44,604 --> 01:14:46,904
- Just walk on the pebbles.
- Okay.

1231
01:14:46,906 --> 01:14:49,075
On the pebbles.
On the pebbles.

1232
01:14:50,609 --> 01:14:52,344
No, on the pebbles.

1233
01:14:53,379 --> 01:14:55,245
Yeah. Step down.

1234
01:14:55,247 --> 01:14:57,149
It's okay. It's okay.

1235
01:14:58,317 --> 01:15:00,116
I got you. I got you.

1236
01:15:00,118 --> 01:15:02,619
Oh. Sand.

1237
01:15:02,621 --> 01:15:04,420
I'm on the sand.
You're on the rocks.

1238
01:15:04,422 --> 01:15:06,089
See?

1239
01:15:06,091 --> 01:15:08,228
We're on our way
to the party.

1240
01:15:09,895 --> 01:15:11,628
See? You're not
getting muddy at all.

1241
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:12,996
Ooh.

1242
01:15:12,998 --> 01:15:15,231
You don't have to step
on that rock, but...

1243
01:15:15,233 --> 01:15:17,634
Yeah, here we are.

1244
01:15:17,636 --> 01:15:19,969
We live our lives. We're busy.
And all this stuff going on...

1245
01:15:19,971 --> 01:15:21,472
Yeah,
but then that kind of implies

1246
01:15:21,474 --> 01:15:23,307
that you're not
present enough with each other

1247
01:15:23,309 --> 01:15:25,441
on a day-to-day basis
to know that...

1248
01:15:25,443 --> 01:15:28,078
Yo, Matt. What's up, Matt?

1249
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,914
Whoa. David. Holy... Dude, I
can't believe you're here.

1250
01:15:30,916 --> 01:15:32,016
What's going on?

1251
01:15:32,018 --> 01:15:35,652
Yo, it's my girlfriend,
Sarah.

1252
01:15:35,654 --> 01:15:37,154
- Your girlfriend?
- Yeah, my girlfriend.

1253
01:15:37,156 --> 01:15:39,522
Yeah?
Is he paying you?

1254
01:15:39,524 --> 01:15:40,990
- Shut up, Matt.
- Oh, I'm just kidding.

1255
01:15:40,992 --> 01:15:42,927
You're just pulling
my chain, Matt.

1256
01:15:42,929 --> 01:15:45,396
Yes, I am, Sarah. I'm sorry. I
have a messed-up sense of humor.

1257
01:15:45,398 --> 01:15:47,530
- It's cool, man. It's cool. Yo.
- Yeah, come on in.

1258
01:15:47,532 --> 01:15:50,200
- Celebrate with us. Let's make this a bigger holiday.
- Yeah.

1259
01:15:50,202 --> 01:15:53,469
- Yeah, so you remember Karen, of course.
- Hey, Karen. How are you?

1260
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,271
- And Julia.
- Hi.

1261
01:15:55,273 --> 01:15:56,406
Nice to meet you.

1262
01:15:56,408 --> 01:15:58,174
- What's up, Luke?
- What's up, David?

1263
01:15:58,176 --> 01:16:00,209
- What's up, man?
- Hey, good to see you, brother.

1264
01:16:00,211 --> 01:16:01,411
- And this is...
- Sarah.

1265
01:16:01,413 --> 01:16:02,679
Hi, Sarah.

1266
01:16:02,681 --> 01:16:04,147
Sit down, you guys,
please.

1267
01:16:04,149 --> 01:16:05,982
Thank you guys so much
for hosting us.

1268
01:16:05,984 --> 01:16:07,250
- Thank you for having us.
- Thank you.

1269
01:16:07,252 --> 01:16:10,087
So this is David's place
that we are crashing at.

1270
01:16:10,089 --> 01:16:11,422
David, this is amazing.
Thanks for having us.

1271
01:16:11,424 --> 01:16:13,524
Thank you. It's an honor
having you guys here.

1272
01:16:13,526 --> 01:16:16,026
Yeah, it's an amazing honor for
us to be here with you too.

1273
01:16:16,028 --> 01:16:17,593
I mean, the star
of <i>Malibu Mohawks.</i>

1274
01:16:17,595 --> 01:16:19,562
A movie star.

1275
01:16:19,564 --> 01:16:22,066
- No, no, no.
- He loves it. He loves it.

1276
01:16:22,068 --> 01:16:24,034
Mm, not talking
about that right now.

1277
01:16:24,036 --> 01:16:26,235
Why don't you
tell him our other news?

1278
01:16:26,237 --> 01:16:28,038
- Oh, my God.
- I popped the question.

1279
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,707
- Wow.
- Wow. You're getting married?

1280
01:16:29,709 --> 01:16:31,275
You said yes?

1281
01:16:31,277 --> 01:16:33,177
Yeah, I said yes.
I'm wearing the ring.

1282
01:16:33,179 --> 01:16:34,177
Of course.

1283
01:16:34,179 --> 01:16:36,112
Congratulations.
Mazel tov.

1284
01:16:36,114 --> 01:16:38,548
- Thank you.
- So are we!

1285
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:41,285
- You guys too?
- We've been discussing it lately,

1286
01:16:41,287 --> 01:16:43,052
like in theory
and all that, you know?

1287
01:16:43,054 --> 01:16:45,722
You don't waste
any time, huh, man?

1288
01:16:45,724 --> 01:16:48,057
- Are you nervous?
- It's been the best two weeks of my life.

1289
01:16:48,059 --> 01:16:50,393
Yeah, David was especially
really, really nervous.

1290
01:16:50,395 --> 01:16:51,628
No, I'm not.

1291
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:55,332
About the... Yes. It's about the
penis going inside the vagina.

1292
01:16:55,334 --> 01:16:56,400
Whoa.

1293
01:16:56,402 --> 01:16:57,435
- Oh.
- No, no, no, no.

1294
01:16:57,437 --> 01:17:00,570
But I did teach him
how to have sexual intercourse

1295
01:17:00,572 --> 01:17:04,674
in a very constructive way
for the very first time

1296
01:17:04,676 --> 01:17:08,344
- at my bedroom in my apartment.
- Use a condom.

1297
01:17:08,346 --> 01:17:09,679
Oh!

1298
01:17:11,216 --> 01:17:14,219
I love condoms.
I live in a condom.

1299
01:17:16,688 --> 01:17:18,454
She's just very sheltered.

1300
01:17:18,456 --> 01:17:20,524
She thought you're
talking about condos.

1301
01:17:20,526 --> 01:17:22,459
What?

1302
01:17:22,461 --> 01:17:26,396
Not only am I very innocent
and really beautiful princess,

1303
01:17:26,398 --> 01:17:30,536
but I'm a lyric soprano singer
with perfect pitch.

1304
01:17:32,337 --> 01:17:39,075
<i>♪ Let me call you
Sweetheart ♪</i>

1305
01:17:39,077 --> 01:17:46,383
<i>♪ I'm in love with you ♪</i>

1306
01:17:46,385 --> 01:17:51,588
<i>♪ Let me hear you whisper ♪</i>

1307
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:52,722
Okay.

1308
01:17:52,724 --> 01:17:54,357
<i>♪ That you love me too ♪</i>

1309
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:56,392
That's wonderful, isn't it?
That's great, okay?

1310
01:17:56,394 --> 01:17:59,295
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- She's got a nice voice.

1311
01:17:59,297 --> 01:18:01,565
Please stop.
Please stop. Please stop.

1312
01:18:01,567 --> 01:18:08,304
<i>♪ Let me call you

1313
01:18:08,306 --> 01:18:14,578
<i>♪ I'm in love with you ♪</i>

1314
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:17,080
- Please stop.
- <i>♪ I'm in love with you ♪</i>

1315
01:18:17,082 --> 01:18:18,449
Stop it. Zip it.

1316
01:18:18,451 --> 01:18:21,451
Please, please.
I'm sorry. Just... Please.

1317
01:18:21,453 --> 01:18:25,155
I'm sorry. You're right in my ear
and-and piercing my ears, okay?

1318
01:18:25,157 --> 01:18:28,228
Okay, please? Please.

1319
01:18:29,627 --> 01:18:31,294
I mean, Matt was
applauding it.

1320
01:18:31,296 --> 01:18:32,795
I know. I know.
But you don't understand.

1321
01:18:32,797 --> 01:18:36,866
People are clapping because
they're trying to be polite.

1322
01:18:36,868 --> 01:18:38,869
- They don't like your music.
- I was just...

1323
01:18:38,871 --> 01:18:41,472
- You're embarrassing me.
- I was just...

1324
01:18:41,474 --> 01:18:43,507
In front of some
very important people.

1325
01:18:43,509 --> 01:18:45,843
You're even
embarrassing yourself.

1326
01:18:45,845 --> 01:18:48,515
Just trust me. Okay?

1327
01:18:49,482 --> 01:18:52,382
So, how about this?

1328
01:18:52,384 --> 01:18:55,418
A guy walks
into a sex shop, right?

1329
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:59,323
And he says,
"I want a blow-up doll."

1330
01:18:59,325 --> 01:19:01,191
"A male doll
or female doll?"

1331
01:19:01,193 --> 01:19:04,464
"A male doll."
"A black doll or white doll?"

1332
01:19:31,623 --> 01:19:33,425
Oh.

1333
01:20:28,581 --> 01:20:29,745
What's wrong?

1334
01:20:29,747 --> 01:20:30,981
Where's Sarah?

1335
01:20:30,983 --> 01:20:32,816
Well, she begged me
to take her home.

1336
01:20:32,818 --> 01:20:34,521
Geraldo's driving her back.

1337
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,489
What happened?

1338
01:20:39,992 --> 01:20:41,792
Nothing.

1339
01:20:41,794 --> 01:20:43,662
Okay.

1340
01:21:10,322 --> 01:21:11,754
<i>The mailbox is full</i>

1341
01:21:11,756 --> 01:21:13,923
<i>and cannot accept
any messages at this time.</i>

1342
01:21:13,925 --> 01:21:15,327
<i>Good-bye.</i>

1343
01:21:28,607 --> 01:21:30,777
David, give me some
of the lox, please.

1344
01:21:33,612 --> 01:21:34,781
David.

1345
01:21:37,683 --> 01:21:38,618
David.

1346
01:21:40,419 --> 01:21:43,590
Will you pass Dad the lox?
We've asked you three times.

1347
01:21:45,623 --> 01:21:47,057
Thanks, honey.

1348
01:21:47,059 --> 01:21:48,361
You okay?

1349
01:21:50,362 --> 01:21:53,362
He's a little upset
about that girl.

1350
01:21:53,364 --> 01:21:55,632
Oh, your bride.

1351
01:21:55,634 --> 01:21:57,034
Are you joking?

1352
01:21:57,036 --> 01:21:59,272
Never mind.
It's a private joke.

1353
01:22:01,607 --> 01:22:05,308
Oh, it would have been a lot,
sweetheart, with all you go through,

1354
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:08,411
to take care of someone
with problems like that.

1355
01:22:08,413 --> 01:22:09,849
What was her issue anyway?

1356
01:22:10,782 --> 01:22:12,618
She had an LD.

1357
01:22:13,419 --> 01:22:15,084
An LD. What's that?

1358
01:22:15,086 --> 01:22:16,820
Learning disability.

1359
01:22:16,822 --> 01:22:19,325
Oh, I'd say more than that.

1360
01:22:20,459 --> 01:22:22,426
Was she brain damaged?

1361
01:22:22,428 --> 01:22:25,795
I mean, you'd ask her a simple
question and she'd talk your head off.

1362
01:22:25,797 --> 01:22:28,632
It was a non-verbal
learning disability.

1363
01:22:28,634 --> 01:22:32,668
She also ate a dozen radish
roses off my fish platter.

1364
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:35,504
A dozen radishes. I'm not kidding.

1365
01:22:35,506 --> 01:22:36,776
I thought she was sweet.

1366
01:22:38,410 --> 01:22:39,545
She was weird.

1367
01:22:40,979 --> 01:22:44,448
David, better you
should find someone

1368
01:22:44,450 --> 01:22:48,618
who maybe is more advanced
at things than you are.

1369
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:52,388
Like Melinda,
that girl you used to date?

1370
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:55,025
Angie.
Whatever happened to Angie?

1371
01:22:55,027 --> 01:22:56,863
The girls from the Internet.

1372
01:23:03,001 --> 01:23:06,570
Well, we go
to Florida next week.

1373
01:23:06,572 --> 01:23:08,875
Maybe that'll cheer him up.

1374
01:23:11,443 --> 01:23:14,580
I liked her
because she was weird, Mom.

1375
01:23:17,148 --> 01:23:19,451
I'm weird too.

1376
01:23:27,826 --> 01:23:30,927
What do you think about this
for Annie and this for Zach?

1377
01:23:30,929 --> 01:23:34,897
Sammy, is Sarah backstage? I
really need to speak to her, okay?

1378
01:23:34,899 --> 01:23:37,801
Backstage is for actors
who wanna be in my play,

1379
01:23:37,803 --> 01:23:41,137
not for actors who called it "a load
of bullshit," like you called it.

1380
01:23:41,139 --> 01:23:43,073
I wanna be an actor
in your play, okay?

1381
01:23:43,075 --> 01:23:46,008
I'll even go butt naked
if you want.

1382
01:23:46,010 --> 01:23:49,812
I'll even do a gay sex scene with you.
Just let me see Sarah.

1383
01:23:49,814 --> 01:23:54,918
After what you did to her, she decided
she wants nothing to do with you.

1384
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:58,021
So please go away, you asshole.

1385

1386
01:24:07,465 --> 01:24:11,034

1389
01:24:18,911 --> 01:24:22,945
The other day my dad said he wanted
some wine, so I gave him some.

1390
01:24:22,947 --> 01:24:25,582
"Dad, do I have to?"

1391
01:24:25,584 --> 01:24:28,485
I get very angry when innocent
people get hurt by bullies.

1392
01:24:28,487 --> 01:24:30,853
And it is my job
to protect them.

1393
01:24:30,855 --> 01:24:32,722
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-
whoo-whoo-whoo!

1394
01:24:32,724 --> 01:24:37,227
Try to find
what's going on in their mind

1395
01:24:37,229 --> 01:24:41,765
when you see somebody
who's in need.

1396
01:24:41,767 --> 01:24:43,933
For those of you
who don't know me,

1397
01:24:43,935 --> 01:24:48,538
my name is Jared Klimber, and I'm
from the South Shore of Long Island.

1398
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:51,141
I would like to take a moment.

1399
01:24:51,143 --> 01:24:53,776
Just because I grew up
on an educated...

1400
01:24:53,778 --> 01:24:56,146
What do you do
with the mad that you feel

1401
01:24:56,148 --> 01:24:58,815
when you feel so mad
you could bite?

1402
01:24:58,817 --> 01:25:02,985
What do you say when you see a fawn?
"Oh, dear."

1403
01:25:18,504 --> 01:25:20,536
Hi. I'm Sarah.

1404
01:25:20,538 --> 01:25:22,838
Um, I really
wanna take this time

1405
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:27,646
to show the entire world
my musical theater beauty glow.

1406
01:27:41,345 --> 01:27:43,049
You getting on or not?

1407
01:27:45,716 --> 01:27:47,719
You getting on
or not, man?

1408
01:27:56,361 --> 01:27:58,027
Here, keep the change.

1409
01:27:58,029 --> 01:27:59,732
Exact change.

1410
01:28:04,301 --> 01:28:06,738
2.75.

1411
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:12,944
One, two...

1412
01:28:16,915 --> 01:28:17,813
Aah!

1413
01:28:17,815 --> 01:28:21,886
Sorry. I-I-I've never been
on a bus before.

1414
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:28,825
Do you have $2.75, sir?

1415
01:28:28,827 --> 01:28:29,762
Aah.

1416
01:28:31,095 --> 01:28:35,901
One, two, three, um...

1417
01:28:41,339 --> 01:28:43,175
Sarah?

1418
01:28:53,452 --> 01:28:55,221
I don't know how much.

1419
01:29:00,192 --> 01:29:01,725
That's it.

1420
01:29:01,727 --> 01:29:03,796
No. Just one more quarter.
