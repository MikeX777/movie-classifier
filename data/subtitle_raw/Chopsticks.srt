1
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:48,171
Ganesh, clean the car.

2
00:00:55,046 --> 00:00:56,005
...here's your car.

3
00:00:56,588 --> 00:01:00,588
I wanted plates with numbers
that added up to nine.

4
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:01,921
But these add up to 11.

5
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:07,963
Eleven is a lucky number for some. Right?

6
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,463
The Twin Towers were attacked on the 11th.

7
00:01:13,963 --> 00:01:16,505
September 11th
is the 254th day of the year.

8
00:01:16,963 --> 00:01:19,755
Those numbers add up to 11.

9
00:01:22,296 --> 00:01:23,963
...looked like an 11.

10
00:01:24,505 --> 00:01:28,171
The plane that crashed into them
was Flight 11.

11
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,546
It was carrying...

12
00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:32,130
-That adds up to--
-Eleven.

13
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:35,546
The pilot was Ramsy Yusouf.
His name adds up to 11--

14
00:01:39,546 --> 00:01:43,046
We don't choose the license plates.

15
00:01:43,338 --> 00:01:44,796
They are sent to us. Okay?

16
00:02:24,755 --> 00:02:28,505
No. I just picked up the car
from the showroom.

17
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:29,588
Anyway...

18
00:02:31,546 --> 00:02:34,588
You won't have to squeeze
into those crowded buses anymore.

19
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:37,338
And don't be in a rush to remove
the plastic seat covers.

20
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:39,171
-Okay.
-Keep them till they tear.

21
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:41,921
Do the plate numbers add up to nine?

22
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:45,171
-No. It's 11.
-Check it again.

23
00:02:45,255 --> 00:02:47,421
Math was never your strong suit.

24
00:02:47,671 --> 00:02:51,380
-I did. It's 11.
-It's okay.

25
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,588
Is the Guru's picture up?

26
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:54,755
Yes.

27
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:57,421
Then you're fine.
He'll take care of everything.

28
00:02:57,505 --> 00:03:00,213
Don't forget to take the car
to the temple.

29
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:02,255
-Okay.
-Drive carefully.

30
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:04,963
-Mumbai roads aren't like Aurangabad.
-Okay.

31
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:10,838
Until you get used to the car,
wear a helmet for a week or so.

32
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:12,630
-Mom...
-What do you mean?

33
00:03:12,713 --> 00:03:15,755
-And take care of the keys.
-Okay.

34
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,421
Mom, I need to hang up.

35
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:19,921
I don't want to get a ticket
on my first day.

36
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:21,088
Fine.

37
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:25,838
-Are you practicing confidence-building?
-I'm hanging up now.

38
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:26,838
And--

39
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:13,380
I have done that.

40
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,546
Here's Ms. Uncool.

41
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:28,546
The Dharavi slum is currently
the world's third largest slum.

42
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:33,963
Dharavi has an active economy.

43
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:38,338
Leather, textiles and pottery products

44
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:42,921
are among the goods made here.

45
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:44,963
This is where

46
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:51,796
Danny Boyle's award-winning movie
Slumdog Millionaire was filmed.

47
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:56,505
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Dharavi.

48
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:13,421
Hello, you ask me to make
And I make with a clove

49
00:06:13,713 --> 00:06:16,296
White and Chinese guys are shocked

50
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,171
Don't waste your time by coming here

51
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:22,046
Business is at a loss
I am cold-hearted, move away

52
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,213
Life is not a joke, don't smoke

53
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:27,796
Everything is cheap
It's just that I don't get sleep

54
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,630
Debt doesn't stop me
I keep going fearlessly

55
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:33,588
Business is touching the sky
It's just that you're sly

56
00:06:33,671 --> 00:06:35,671
Look at the Chinese
They sell nothing less than Mercedes

57
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:38,921
The public is smart these days
Before you go, check your way

58
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:40,671
We make the rules and regulations

59
00:06:40,755 --> 00:06:43,546
You're just after a dream
Oh yeah, fulfill that, don't scream

60
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,130
You're just after a dream...

61
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:57,880
There are a lot of Chinese tourists
coming here these days.

62
00:06:58,171 --> 00:07:01,088
That guy who made the Slumdog movie
should be smacked.

63
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,130
That's right.

64
00:07:05,713 --> 00:07:08,921
Ladies and gentlemen,

65
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:11,588
an interesting piece
of information for you -

66
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:17,755
this is the only place in the world

67
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:21,088
that makes more counterfeit goods
than China!

68
00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:33,255
Yes. How much?

69
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:35,713
Not now. Pay when you leave.

70
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:37,588
Okay.

71
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:46,921
-Where do I park?
-Take the first right up ahead.

72
00:08:53,838 --> 00:08:56,463
-Are you blind?
-What are you looking at? Move on.

73
00:08:56,546 --> 00:08:57,796
She could have killed me.

74
00:08:58,005 --> 00:08:59,213
Shall I park it for you?

75
00:09:00,713 --> 00:09:01,546
Yes.

76
00:09:02,838 --> 00:09:04,921
Be careful. It's brand new.

77
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:06,421
I do this every day.

78
00:09:27,713 --> 00:09:28,546
Yes, ma'am.

79
00:09:43,588 --> 00:09:45,005
Take it and go.

80
00:09:52,713 --> 00:09:53,921
Take my offering.

81
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:10,380
One Misal Pav.

82
00:10:11,755 --> 00:10:13,546
Where's the pay-and-park lot?

83
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,171
There isn't any...

84
00:10:16,255 --> 00:10:19,296
What is this?
It's a receipt for the public restroom.

85
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,505
Did you park in a no-parking zone?

86
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,796
They must have towed your car away.

87
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:28,171
The pay-and-park guy parked my car.

88
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:29,921
He parked it for you?

89
00:10:35,171 --> 00:10:36,838
I think your car has been stolen.

90
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,171
What's the complaint?

91
00:11:15,796 --> 00:11:17,296
My car was stolen.

92
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:19,838
From where?

93
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:22,213
From near the Mahalakshmi temple.

94
00:11:23,838 --> 00:11:24,838
Your name?

95
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,338
Nirma Sahastrabuddhe.

96
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,255
Nirma?

97
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:32,713
As in the washing powder?

98
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:38,338
Where did you park it?

99
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:40,963
I didn't park it myself.

100
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,505
I thought this guy
was the pay-and-park valet.

101
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:45,255
I gave him the keys. So he...

102
00:11:46,713 --> 00:11:48,005
You handed him the keys?

103
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:51,130
That's not theft.

104
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,255
You gifted a car to a thief.

105
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:57,088
Make and model?

106
00:12:00,005 --> 00:12:02,005
I'll be 25 in March.

107
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:05,130
I was talking about the car.

108
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:08,671
It was brand new.

109
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:11,088
I picked it up
from the showroom this morning.

110
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,088
The plastic covers
were still on the seats.

111
00:12:16,671 --> 00:12:17,713
License plate number.

112
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:26,505
Please write your address
and phone number.

113
00:12:26,588 --> 00:12:27,713
Sign at the bottom.

114
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:32,255
Will I get my car back?

115
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:33,630
Of course.

116
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,296
I'll mobilize the entire force,

117
00:12:37,671 --> 00:12:38,963
and find your car.

118
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:49,046
Make sure you give him
your property papers.

119
00:12:49,338 --> 00:12:50,463
-Property papers?
-Yeah.

120
00:12:50,546 --> 00:12:54,421
I'll be going there tomorrow. Call him.

121
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:07,088
You're here about your car, right?

122
00:13:10,338 --> 00:13:11,921
You have three days to find it.

123
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,921
If you don't,
it will either be shipped out of town,

124
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:18,713
or the chop shops
will have stripped it down to parts.

125
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:24,088
But, they told me they would find it.

126
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:28,838
They just say that.

127
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:31,838
They won't make a move for three days.

128
00:13:35,421 --> 00:13:36,963
I know a guy.

129
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:39,213
He can get it done.

130
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:42,588
What does he charge?

131
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,755
He's eccentric that way...

132
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:49,838
If he likes you,
he may even do it for free.

133
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:02,296
Mr. Patil, can I borrow your pen?

134
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:06,380
Here, jot it down.

135
00:14:18,546 --> 00:14:20,963
He's avoided prison for 18 years.

136
00:14:21,046 --> 00:14:22,671
Wouldn't you call him an artist?

137
00:14:25,171 --> 00:14:26,338
Take me, for instance.

138
00:14:27,838 --> 00:14:29,588
This is my second time this month.

139
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:31,005
Let's go. It's time.

140
00:14:31,088 --> 00:14:33,505
You think you own that pen?
Give it back to me.

141
00:14:34,088 --> 00:14:34,921
Let's go.

142
00:14:43,838 --> 00:14:47,463
The women in our family
have a new WhatsApp group.

143
00:14:47,546 --> 00:14:49,796
Sahastrabuddhe Beauties.

144
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,296
I put up a picture of you
and your new car.

145
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,463
It's getting a lot of comments.

146
00:14:54,546 --> 00:14:58,046
We wanted to surprise you,
but I just have to tell you.

147
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,005
Your dad and I are coming
over this weekend to see the car.

148
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:05,963
-But, Mom--
-But we can't stay very long.

149
00:15:06,463 --> 00:15:09,713
Your dad and I
are starting a keto diet on Monday.

150
00:15:09,796 --> 00:15:12,630
Make sure your read all the....
I'll hang up.

151
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:25,963
May I speak to Mr. Artist?

152
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:30,671
My name is Nirma.

153
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:51,713
I'm here
to check your internet connection.

154
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:57,755
It's fine.

155
00:16:58,546 --> 00:16:59,713
Let me do it.

156
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:01,588
It won't take too long.

157
00:18:21,296 --> 00:18:23,421
All Chinese sauces
are so popular in India.

158
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:27,463
You can use it with chicken,
cottage cheese.

159
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:30,171
You can cook it with shrimp or fish.

160
00:18:30,255 --> 00:18:33,463
It goes with everything.

161
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:37,171
Children are especially fond
of sweet and sour sauce.

162
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:43,421
We'll be making this dish using fish.

163
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:48,463
Here's what you need to do...

164
00:18:48,546 --> 00:18:50,005
The oil is heating up,

165
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:55,921
meanwhile, let's prepare the sauce.

166
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:58,463
The oil is heating up.

167
00:18:58,671 --> 00:18:59,921
Don't use too much oil.

168
00:19:05,338 --> 00:19:10,921
We then add some ginger and garlic.

169
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:14,296
Now we add onions.

170
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:16,755
And then...

171
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,296
Now we add onions.

172
00:19:23,421 --> 00:19:25,588
And while this cooks,

173
00:19:25,671 --> 00:19:28,838
we will be taking a small break.

174
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:32,255
See you after the break.

175
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:36,255
Hello. I'm Sanjeev Kapoor.

176
00:19:36,796 --> 00:19:38,880
Do you want to become India's Super Chef?

177
00:19:39,171 --> 00:19:40,255
Then get ready.

178
00:19:40,463 --> 00:19:43,796
I'm headed to your city,
in search of the Super Chef.

179
00:20:44,921 --> 00:20:46,630
Couldn't your parents
find you a better name?

180
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,130
Excuse me?

181
00:20:52,213 --> 00:20:53,463
You're named after a detergent.

182
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:59,588
Well, the day I was born...

183
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:04,213
was the day my dad
got his Nirma detergent franchise.

184
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,296
So...

185
00:21:05,546 --> 00:21:08,588
Good thing it wasn't an iPhone franchise.
He might have named you...

186
00:21:17,588 --> 00:21:19,671
Do you know the English name
for the rawas fish?

187
00:21:31,338 --> 00:21:32,171
Do you?

188
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,421
It is...

189
00:21:39,546 --> 00:21:41,546
The "L" is silent. Did you study English?

190
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,255
You should ask your school for a refund.

191
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,130
But, it's been so long
that they will refuse.

192
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:07,588
Hello.

193
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,963
Mrs. Wu, how are you?

194
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,838
You have a tummy ache?

195
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,505
How?

196
00:22:16,588 --> 00:22:19,880
Oh, you should have asked
before eating Indian Chinese.

197
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,088
I'm very sorry.

198
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,130
We can't do that.

199
00:22:26,213 --> 00:22:30,296
We can't postpone tomorrow's trip.

200
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,213
Thanks.

201
00:22:36,171 --> 00:22:38,005
Do you work at the Shaolin temple?

202
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:43,088
No.

203
00:22:46,755 --> 00:22:47,963
A translator means--

204
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:50,713
I know. I did go to high school,
and I learned English.

205
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:54,338
What is Mandarin?

206
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:56,755
It's a Chinese language.

207
00:22:57,588 --> 00:22:58,671
Why Chinese?

208
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:03,505
I wanted to learn...

209
00:23:06,713 --> 00:23:09,088
or any other European language.

210
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,380
But my dad said I should learn Chinese.

211
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
It is the most populous country.

212
00:23:15,713 --> 00:23:17,463
He said it will always be in demand.

213
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,296
And you really can't depend on Europe.

214
00:23:20,588 --> 00:23:23,713
They're fickle. They might even
start using another language.

215
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:26,838
Do you speak it well?

216
00:23:27,963 --> 00:23:29,213
I'm okay at it.

217
00:23:30,005 --> 00:23:30,838
Can you cuss?

218
00:23:31,338 --> 00:23:32,255
Excuse me?

219
00:23:33,963 --> 00:23:34,921
Cuss in Chinese?

220
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,588
I don't swear in any language.

221
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,463
Is that so?

222
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:46,963
Have you never said,
"Fuck, that's some great lamb"?

223
00:23:51,546 --> 00:23:55,296
Never said, "Fuck, I'm screwed today"?

224
00:23:58,255 --> 00:24:00,838
You've never used
the word "fuck" in anger?

225
00:24:06,213 --> 00:24:08,005
You won't help me now.

226
00:24:10,046 --> 00:24:12,588
Please help me.

227
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:15,796
-Nothing else in this city belongs to me.
-Where was the car stolen?

228
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:16,963
Huh?

229
00:24:17,796 --> 00:24:18,713
Your car.

230
00:24:19,463 --> 00:24:20,380
Where was it stolen?

231
00:24:21,421 --> 00:24:23,671
Near the Mahalakshmi temple.

232
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,755
I went to ask for God's blessings.

233
00:24:25,838 --> 00:24:27,088
Do you still believe in God?

234
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:30,046
It's not His fault.
I handed the keys to a thief.

235
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:38,796
I'll text you on WhatsApp
about tomorrow's meeting.

236
00:24:40,463 --> 00:24:41,546
You need me?

237
00:24:43,005 --> 00:24:44,296
You are my ride.

238
00:24:45,171 --> 00:24:49,630
-But my car has been stolen.
-I couldn't possibly own a car?

239
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,213
Of course, you could.

240
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,880
What do I owe you?

241
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:31,796
-Amit!
-Yes, sir?

242
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,671
-Remove those tires.
-I'll do it after I dismantle the engine.

243
00:25:35,255 --> 00:25:38,296
Hello. Yes, yes.

244
00:25:39,421 --> 00:25:42,296
Tell me the license plate number.
The red one, right?

245
00:25:43,338 --> 00:25:45,046
Come in the evening. It'll be done.

246
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,838
NASIK, PUNE, NAGPUR,
MUMBAI, THANE, JABALPUR

247
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,046
-You know Shafiq, right?
-The...

248
00:25:50,088 --> 00:25:51,171
Yes, him.

249
00:25:51,755 --> 00:25:54,088
He went to enroll his son
at school yesterday.

250
00:25:55,088 --> 00:25:57,546
They asked the kid what he wanted to be
when he grew up.

251
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,880
Do you know what he said?

252
00:26:02,255 --> 00:26:04,338
-Did he get enrolled?
-Fat chance.

253
00:26:04,921 --> 00:26:06,755
-But Shafiq is really happy.
-Really?

254
00:26:09,088 --> 00:26:11,421
Please stop this thing.

255
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:14,213
...sir. Listen to me.

256
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:18,005
I don't have any money,

257
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,338
honestly.

258
00:26:19,921 --> 00:26:21,296
Please turn this thing off.

259
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:23,005
I've been running for so long.

260
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,671
Please turn it off.
I have a heart condition.

261
00:26:26,255 --> 00:26:28,880
...sir. I can't run anymore.

262
00:26:31,255 --> 00:26:32,380
Here's the thing.

263
00:26:33,505 --> 00:26:38,671
I never call anyone twice.
I have a reputation to protect.

264
00:26:38,755 --> 00:26:39,755
But, sir...

265
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,713
I called you three times.

266
00:26:45,713 --> 00:26:46,963
You do have a good voice.

267
00:26:49,671 --> 00:26:51,088
You never answered my calls.

268
00:26:53,088 --> 00:26:54,421
Were you screwing someone?

269
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:58,088
Gosh! No, sir. What are you saying?

270
00:26:58,505 --> 00:27:02,005
I was really busy at work.

271
00:27:02,255 --> 00:27:05,130
I mean, I was busy looking for a job,

272
00:27:05,546 --> 00:27:06,380
honestly.

273
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,005
You bought a three-bedroom apartment
in Lokhandwala last month.

274
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,463
No... I mean, I did but...

275
00:27:12,963 --> 00:27:16,796
I spent everything on the décor.
I have nothing left, honestly.

276
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,296
You're a playback singer,
a judge on Little Champs.

277
00:27:20,921 --> 00:27:22,421
You do live shows abroad.

278
00:27:23,213 --> 00:27:25,380
Yet you have nothing left for me?

279
00:27:26,213 --> 00:27:28,380
Honestly, sir. I'm flat broke.

280
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:31,296
Sir... don't increase the speed.

281
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,338
Please, sir.

282
00:27:32,421 --> 00:27:34,755
-I'm exhausted.
-Boss?

283
00:27:34,838 --> 00:27:36,796
-Sir...
-Bitliya is here.

284
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,046
Sir, sir...

285
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:43,630
Did you feed chocolate to Bahubali?

286
00:27:43,713 --> 00:27:44,630
Yes, boss.

287
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,588
Haven't you read his diet chart?

288
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,380
Next month, he has his 100th fight.

289
00:27:49,463 --> 00:27:51,088
Chocolate will weaken his bones.

290
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:55,463
Sir, I'm illiterate, so--

291
00:27:55,546 --> 00:27:56,921
You can't read?

292
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,296
Asshole, the government keeps telling you,

293
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,255
"Education is the path to success."

294
00:28:03,338 --> 00:28:04,296
Yet, here you are.

295
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:07,921
...boss. It was a mistake.

296
00:28:08,005 --> 00:28:09,171
I won't do it again.

297
00:28:09,505 --> 00:28:11,546
Please, boss. Forgive me.

298
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,796
I won't do it again. Please forgive me.

299
00:28:14,046 --> 00:28:16,046
I won't give anyone chocolate anymore.

300
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,338
I won't eat it either. I am an asshole.

301
00:28:19,421 --> 00:28:22,755
Boss, boss...

302
00:28:27,671 --> 00:28:31,046
Sir, please let me go.

303
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:37,088
I swear on Bahubali,
I will pray for his victory every day.

304
00:28:37,671 --> 00:28:38,505
...sir.

305
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:41,088
Fine.

306
00:28:42,338 --> 00:28:43,338
You don't have to pay.

307
00:28:43,838 --> 00:28:45,213
Really, sir?

308
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,713
In exchange,

309
00:28:52,505 --> 00:28:54,046
sing me my favorite song.

310
00:29:07,755 --> 00:29:11,338
Life is a beautiful journey

311
00:29:11,421 --> 00:29:15,088
Who knows what tomorrow will bring

312
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:18,671
Life is a beautiful journey

313
00:29:18,755 --> 00:29:22,421
Who knows what tomorrow will bring

314
00:29:32,463 --> 00:29:35,963
Sorry, sir.
I'm off-key without my harmonium.

315
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,463
Hey, look.

316
00:31:58,505 --> 00:32:00,796
Mr. Zaveri has spent a fortune on this.

317
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:03,005
Sir,

318
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,130
that's why we brought it to you.

319
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:07,296
It's a brand new model.

320
00:32:12,546 --> 00:32:13,463
Manual?

321
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,421
Sir, it's Good Friday.
Manuel is at church.

322
00:32:19,255 --> 00:32:22,796
Dumbass,
I meant the manual for this model.

323
00:32:23,755 --> 00:32:24,588
I have it.

324
00:32:33,213 --> 00:32:36,005
Sir, it's in...

325
00:32:38,963 --> 00:32:41,046
Yeah, Mom. I know I keep putting you off.

326
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,046
-But I am very busy.
-Sweet timing!

327
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,380
No, please don't come next weekend.
I'll let you know.

328
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,630
Okay. I'll call you later.

329
00:33:03,796 --> 00:33:06,046
Translate it into words
that I can understand.

330
00:33:13,421 --> 00:33:17,338
"This safe is unbreakable."

331
00:33:18,588 --> 00:33:19,671
It says...

332
00:34:31,213 --> 00:34:33,546
-Count this.
-Look at this.

333
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,171
Look, the box is open.

334
00:34:35,255 --> 00:34:37,796
It will fetch a good price.

335
00:34:37,963 --> 00:34:39,796
-How much will this get?
-At least 100,000 rupees.

336
00:34:40,213 --> 00:34:41,838
This? How much will this fetch?

337
00:34:44,546 --> 00:34:45,838
Count this as well.

338
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:47,421
How much is this worth?

339
00:34:47,505 --> 00:34:49,338
There's more. Wait.

340
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,421
Wait... which stone is this?

341
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:55,380
-Is this sapphire?
-Wow! Look at the way it shines.

342
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,213
Take the keys and bring the car.

343
00:35:05,213 --> 00:35:08,213
-Is this your family photo?
-It's the Godrej Locks Company family.

344
00:35:12,463 --> 00:35:15,046
For 18 years,
I've been opening the locks they make.

345
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,630
I feel we have a connection now.

346
00:35:28,755 --> 00:35:29,755
It's a...

347
00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:35,463
Can you break any lock?

348
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,171
"Break"?

349
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,588
Every lock has a heart.
I listen to the heartbeat.

350
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:51,296
Your dog is pretty cute.

351
00:35:52,046 --> 00:35:53,088
What's his name?

352
00:36:03,755 --> 00:36:05,130
I had another, smaller dog.

353
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:14,630
Where's he?

354
00:36:15,296 --> 00:36:16,213
He died...

355
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,713
because of...

356
00:36:18,921 --> 00:36:20,880
Small Pox had cholera?

357
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,671
...was the name of my third dog.

358
00:36:34,671 --> 00:36:36,505
Have you ever stolen a car?

359
00:36:37,588 --> 00:36:40,921
Does an ophthalmologist
perform heart surgery?

360
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:44,130
-No.
-We work by the same rule.

361
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,671
Ever stolen anything?

362
00:36:49,755 --> 00:36:51,338
No. Never.

363
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,630
It's just a matter of...

364
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:55,463
Excuse me?

365
00:36:56,338 --> 00:36:59,380
Everyone steals at some point.
You will too.

366
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,213
What's causing this traffic jam?

367
00:37:13,713 --> 00:37:15,005
What's going on here?

368
00:37:15,088 --> 00:37:16,713
What a menace.

369
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,296
What is the problem with these guys.

370
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:31,213
Even the police aren't helping.

371
00:37:31,296 --> 00:37:33,505
How long will this continue.

372
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,838
It's been at a standstill for 15 minutes.

373
00:37:56,755 --> 00:37:58,713
This is too much. We're running late.

374
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,463
Why in the middle of the road?
Go to an arena.

375
00:38:25,505 --> 00:38:27,921
Why did you stop? Keep playing.

376
00:39:24,088 --> 00:39:25,713
Who played the National Anthem?

377
00:39:26,255 --> 00:39:29,296
Let's go. We can't play anything
after the nation anthem.

378
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,338
Let's go. Let's go.

379
00:39:31,755 --> 00:39:34,255
-That was a great...
-Who thought it up?

380
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:36,546
It was the idea of that guy in the...

381
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:38,505
Come on, let's go.

382
00:39:38,588 --> 00:39:39,463
Look at the politician's face.

383
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:41,796
They'll hit me with shoes
if I have the band play again.

384
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,713
Let's go.

385
00:39:43,421 --> 00:39:45,005
We're causing a traffic jam.

386
00:39:45,421 --> 00:39:47,380
We're causing a traffic jam.

387
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:52,755
The traffic's finally cleared.

388
00:39:53,796 --> 00:39:55,213
They learned a lesson.

389
00:39:55,296 --> 00:39:57,296
-Come on, hurry up.
-That took so long.

390
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,713
That was really tiring.

391
00:40:00,088 --> 00:40:01,213
Come on, hurry up!

392
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,255
ENGLISH LIQUOR STORE

393
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:39,796
Where are we going?

394
00:40:55,255 --> 00:40:57,546
-Did you attend the party yesterday?
-Of course.

395
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,213
-Was it fun.
-It was great.

396
00:40:59,296 --> 00:41:00,338
What's up, Artist?

397
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,463
You said we were going to the CBI.

398
00:41:07,588 --> 00:41:08,421
Chillar....

399
00:41:11,255 --> 00:41:12,630
PATKAR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

400
00:41:14,796 --> 00:41:17,130
The guy has high connections,
like all ministers.

401
00:41:17,213 --> 00:41:18,255
Why do you look so happy?

402
00:41:19,296 --> 00:41:21,796
This picture looks just like you,
but it's not you.

403
00:42:17,921 --> 00:42:22,880
WHEN EVERY CHILD GOES TO SCHOOL,
NO CHILD IS LEFT BEHIND

404
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:28,588
Ironically,
these kids are actually in a school.

405
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:48,380
Where does all that loose change
come from?

406
00:42:50,213 --> 00:42:51,713
Who has the most loose change?

407
00:42:54,755 --> 00:42:55,755
Beggars?

408
00:42:58,713 --> 00:43:00,088
You are not as dumb as you look.

409
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:08,046
These people get loose change from them.

410
00:43:09,338 --> 00:43:12,796
The government offers 100 rupees
in exchange for 90 rupees in coins.

411
00:43:14,546 --> 00:43:15,755
That's it?

412
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,755
Do you know how much they make in a day?

413
00:43:20,588 --> 00:43:23,796
They spend 10,000 rupees a month
on sewing supplies and rubber bands.

414
00:43:26,546 --> 00:43:29,005
Why are they working without clothes on?

415
00:43:30,463 --> 00:43:31,296
For...

416
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:36,088
If they're not wearing clothes,
they have nowhere to hide things.

417
00:43:36,421 --> 00:43:37,671
Mr. UK!

418
00:43:38,171 --> 00:43:39,171
Artist, bro...

419
00:43:40,338 --> 00:43:41,671
He's a dear friend of mine.

420
00:43:46,963 --> 00:43:48,005
Udan Khatola.

421
00:43:48,213 --> 00:43:50,630
Artist, bro!

422
00:43:50,713 --> 00:43:51,588
How are you?

423
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:53,755
-All good?
-Great. Couldn't be better.

424
00:44:02,171 --> 00:44:04,296
I've never sat on a pile of money before.

425
00:44:14,505 --> 00:44:16,046
Call for tea.

426
00:44:17,046 --> 00:44:17,921
Tea.

427
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,213
Damn it! Go!

428
00:44:24,796 --> 00:44:26,463
These scum are a real problem.

429
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:29,963
What's up?

430
00:44:30,921 --> 00:44:31,963
It's a little thing.

431
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,630
Two days ago, her i10 was stolen
near the Mahalakshmi temple.

432
00:44:44,296 --> 00:44:45,130
How?

433
00:44:46,088 --> 00:44:49,213
I gave it to a parking attendant...

434
00:44:49,546 --> 00:44:50,713
What's the plate number?

435
00:44:59,588 --> 00:45:01,046
My vehicle is the best.

436
00:45:08,296 --> 00:45:10,796
Don't worry.
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.

437
00:45:16,963 --> 00:45:17,921
Have some tea.

438
00:45:18,296 --> 00:45:19,255
No, I have to go.

439
00:45:19,338 --> 00:45:20,588
Have some tea first.

440
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:21,671
No, no.

441
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:23,171
Got to go now.

442
00:45:23,296 --> 00:45:25,588
If you hear anything from your boys,
let me know?

443
00:45:25,671 --> 00:45:27,296
Next time, I won't let you go.

444
00:45:28,463 --> 00:45:31,046
What was that dish
you brought me last time?

445
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:33,713
Lasun...

446
00:45:34,963 --> 00:45:35,838
Yeah.

447
00:45:38,255 --> 00:45:40,088
It was delicious. Scrumptious.

448
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,713
I brought you something Indian today.

449
00:45:43,796 --> 00:45:45,213
Take a trip to Manali.

450
00:45:50,213 --> 00:45:52,088
Bro, I feel your love.

451
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:00,505
...if I solve your problem,
will I get a discount on detergent?

452
00:46:07,213 --> 00:46:09,046
That guy is going to find my car?

453
00:46:09,546 --> 00:46:11,838
The beggars near the temple will do it.

454
00:46:12,588 --> 00:46:14,546
When they have information,
we'll get a WhatsApp message.

455
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:19,380
Do the beggars have phones?

456
00:46:21,921 --> 00:46:23,338
What kind of phone do you have?

457
00:46:25,713 --> 00:46:26,755
They have the iPhone 7.

458
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:41,755
-Seems like Bahubali wants to live here.
-He's settled in nicely.

459
00:46:45,963 --> 00:46:49,671
Life is a beautiful journey

460
00:46:49,963 --> 00:46:53,630
Who knows what tomorrow will bring

461
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,671
Life is a beautiful journey

462
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,130
Who knows what tomorrow will bring

463
00:47:07,421 --> 00:47:08,421
Stop!

464
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:12,796
I paid 2.1 million rupees for Bahubali.

465
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:16,588
Are you trying to give him indigestion
with these cheap tomatoes?

466
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,296
How will he perform at the fight?

467
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:24,963
Boss. We have to deliver four i10s
to Uttarakhand. But...

468
00:47:26,546 --> 00:47:27,421
But what?

469
00:47:27,963 --> 00:47:30,088
Bahubali has become attached to one car.

470
00:47:30,588 --> 00:47:32,088
He won't step out of it.

471
00:47:33,505 --> 00:47:34,546
Then keep it.

472
00:47:34,963 --> 00:47:37,463
Never anger a fighter before the fight.

473
00:47:38,046 --> 00:47:39,421
-Right?
-Okay, boss.

474
00:47:39,505 --> 00:47:40,338
Keep it.

475
00:47:41,546 --> 00:47:42,380
Sing!

476
00:48:33,005 --> 00:48:34,171
But...

477
00:49:14,213 --> 00:49:16,671
We need to meet a guy
at Andheri station at 9.

478
00:49:26,796 --> 00:49:28,713
What's wrong? Is Jackie Chan dead?

479
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,796
Today, at work...

480
00:49:42,755 --> 00:49:46,713
I have to quit my job. That's my only...

481
00:50:01,546 --> 00:50:02,546
No other...

482
00:50:11,463 --> 00:50:12,296
No.

483
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,838
No, no!

484
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:22,213
I'm creating the situation you described.

485
00:50:22,963 --> 00:50:23,921
According to you,

486
00:50:24,005 --> 00:50:26,505
if we jumped off this roof,
there's no way we'd survive.

487
00:50:26,755 --> 00:50:28,921
-Right?
-What are you doing?

488
00:50:32,171 --> 00:50:33,338
What are you...

489
00:50:34,255 --> 00:50:35,546
Just answer my question.

490
00:50:38,171 --> 00:50:42,588
According to you, if we jumped from here,
we're dead for sure.

491
00:50:42,671 --> 00:50:44,338
-Yes or no?
-No, no, no.

492
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:45,338
No...

493
00:50:54,921 --> 00:50:56,421
I said jump.

494
00:50:57,005 --> 00:50:58,421
We can always jump backwards.

495
00:51:00,713 --> 00:51:03,588
Whatever the situation,
there are always options.

496
00:51:19,713 --> 00:51:21,588
Yes, Murtuza. We are here.

497
00:51:26,046 --> 00:51:27,713
Sure. We'll wait here.

498
00:51:52,713 --> 00:51:53,838
...sir.

499
00:51:54,963 --> 00:51:56,255
I made you wait a bit.

500
00:51:57,171 --> 00:52:00,005
-These are my working hours, you know.
-That's all right.

501
00:52:00,088 --> 00:52:01,963
Business comes first.

502
00:52:02,671 --> 00:52:05,921
Mr. Udan Khatola said
it was about a close friend of his.

503
00:52:06,421 --> 00:52:07,796
He really does respect you.

504
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:11,005
...do you recognize me?

505
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:13,130
We've met before.

506
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:17,380
-Yes.
-That's why we're meeting you again today.

507
00:52:17,671 --> 00:52:19,046
Come on, bro.

508
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,755
I caused you trouble.

509
00:52:25,171 --> 00:52:26,005
No...

510
00:52:28,463 --> 00:52:30,505
But why did you take my car...

511
00:52:31,088 --> 00:52:33,796
I mean, you have such a lovely car.

512
00:52:34,046 --> 00:52:34,963
What, this one?

513
00:52:35,046 --> 00:52:36,213
I just got this one.

514
00:52:37,546 --> 00:52:38,380
From the showroom?

515
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:39,713
No.

516
00:52:44,963 --> 00:52:46,463
This one will go to Vashi tomorrow.

517
00:52:46,713 --> 00:52:50,463
To the Vasant Vihar Society building,
near the toll plaza.

518
00:52:50,755 --> 00:52:52,380
Gol Bandya has a mechanic shop there.

519
00:52:52,463 --> 00:52:53,838
All the cars I boost go there.

520
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:55,713
That's where her i10 is.

521
00:52:58,171 --> 00:52:59,255
Why thank me?

522
00:52:59,338 --> 00:53:00,380
It's your car.

523
00:53:01,963 --> 00:53:06,838
I think you should give Gol Bandya
a mobile phone in exchange.

524
00:53:07,046 --> 00:53:08,421
He won't like it otherwise.

525
00:53:09,005 --> 00:53:10,713
We'll buy him the best.

526
00:53:18,838 --> 00:53:21,255
It won't matter
if the paint is a little chipped.

527
00:53:21,338 --> 00:53:23,255
It can be touched up.

528
00:53:24,421 --> 00:53:25,630
...we found my car.

529
00:53:27,796 --> 00:53:30,421
I can't believe all that's happened
in these two days.

530
00:53:30,505 --> 00:53:33,421
I saw a safe being cracked,
I stood on a roof ledge,

531
00:53:33,505 --> 00:53:35,046
and I rode in a stolen car.

532
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,296
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

533
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:47,755
-Buy a good one.
-No. I have a card.

534
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,338
You can return it later.

535
00:53:51,088 --> 00:53:52,005
What about you?

536
00:54:15,755 --> 00:54:16,713
I'll take this one.

537
00:54:50,213 --> 00:54:51,255
Try this one.

538
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:57,088
That's fake currency.

539
00:55:29,713 --> 00:55:31,171
Please wait up.

540
00:56:16,838 --> 00:56:17,755
Lost your fear?

541
00:56:20,171 --> 00:56:21,380
Those bills were not fake.

542
00:56:34,338 --> 00:56:38,213
I think I must have been
10 or 12 years old.

543
00:56:39,046 --> 00:56:42,796
I was treated for about a year and a half,

544
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,838
until I finally overcame my stutter.

545
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,380
I had to see a speech therapist
two or three times a week.

546
00:56:50,213 --> 00:56:51,713
A speech therapist is...

547
00:56:55,505 --> 00:56:59,296
I had to practice speaking
with balls in my mouth.

548
00:57:02,713 --> 00:57:03,630
What is it?

549
00:57:03,713 --> 00:57:06,838
In my profession,
that means something entirely different.

550
00:57:17,171 --> 00:57:18,255
Can I ask you a question?

551
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:23,755
Why do you see everything
in black and white?

552
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:26,463
Well...

553
00:57:28,421 --> 00:57:30,921
Everyone does.
They just don't acknowledge it.

554
00:57:43,255 --> 00:57:45,588
I know why you didn't let me drive today.

555
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,296
Because, on the way back,
I'll be driving my own car.

556
00:57:50,171 --> 00:57:52,130
But this is a dead end.

557
00:57:52,963 --> 00:57:55,171
That's why Gol Bandya
has his chop shop here.

558
00:58:38,671 --> 00:58:39,546
It's over there.

559
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,630
Okay, fine.

560
01:00:23,046 --> 01:00:24,463
No, your name won't come up.

561
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:27,338
I told you, I won't drag you into it.

562
01:00:27,755 --> 01:00:28,838
I give you my word.

563
01:00:28,921 --> 01:00:30,005
Go on, hang up.

564
01:00:30,713 --> 01:00:31,713
Yes, hang up.

565
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,671
You were absolutely right.

566
01:00:36,463 --> 01:00:38,838
That bastard, Murtuza, lied to us.

567
01:00:40,421 --> 01:00:42,505
He didn't deliver the car to Gol Bandya.

568
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,630
He gave it to Fayyaz, the gangster.

569
01:01:02,296 --> 01:01:03,838
ABODE OF MERCY

570
01:01:30,796 --> 01:01:31,713
Juice.

571
01:01:41,088 --> 01:01:42,338
Boss, they say it's good.

572
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:50,796
As I said on the phone

573
01:01:51,171 --> 01:01:52,838
they are from Animal Planet.

574
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:55,546
They're making a documentary

575
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,171
on animal fights, around the world.

576
01:02:21,463 --> 01:02:22,380
"Bahu"...

577
01:02:23,546 --> 01:02:24,630
"Bahu"...

578
01:02:25,671 --> 01:02:26,505
..."bali"...

579
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:36,630
Who the hell is Neil?

580
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:39,838
The actor Neil Nitin Mukesh.

581
01:02:50,046 --> 01:02:53,963
Boss, they want to get some footage
of Bahubali.

582
01:02:58,046 --> 01:02:59,463
That's good news.

583
01:03:03,338 --> 01:03:05,130
Publish it in our community paper.

584
01:03:05,213 --> 01:03:08,130
-Okay, boss.
-Our fighter has become a star.

585
01:03:08,213 --> 01:03:09,130
Yes, boss.

586
01:03:58,255 --> 01:04:00,421
...I need to check your Wi-Fi connection.

587
01:04:59,463 --> 01:05:04,046
Last month, HR informed me
I have many vacation days pending.

588
01:05:38,796 --> 01:05:39,796
Do you have change?

589
01:05:45,005 --> 01:05:45,880
Where?

590
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:59,713
BAHUBALI BECOMES A SUPERSTAR

591
01:06:25,796 --> 01:06:28,796
You knew my car was okay,
but you didn't tell me!

592
01:06:29,755 --> 01:06:31,880
That man beside the car - do you know him?

593
01:06:31,963 --> 01:06:33,005
I don't care who he is.

594
01:06:33,171 --> 01:06:35,630
The car beside him is mine.

595
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:12,546
You were the one who told me
there's always another choice.

596
01:07:28,963 --> 01:07:30,755
BAHUBALI BECOMES A SUPERSTAR

597
01:07:32,088 --> 01:07:34,671
How can you be certain that is your car?

598
01:07:35,088 --> 01:07:37,255
Look at this... I put it there.

599
01:07:37,671 --> 01:07:39,630
And the sticker proves it's your car?

600
01:07:40,213 --> 01:07:42,421
I am telling you, this is my car.

601
01:07:42,505 --> 01:07:45,213
I tore a corner when I put it on.

602
01:07:47,713 --> 01:07:49,880
Practically every car has a sticker on it.

603
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:52,630
That's not evidence
to start an investigation.

604
01:07:57,921 --> 01:07:58,880
You're right.

605
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:02,588
But if I'd been
the Commissioner's daughter,

606
01:08:02,671 --> 01:08:04,546
would you be using the same logic on her?

607
01:08:16,796 --> 01:08:19,255
Please aim the pepper spray
properly this time.

608
01:08:28,296 --> 01:08:29,380
How did you get in?

609
01:08:30,338 --> 01:08:32,046
You're asking me that question?

610
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:53,338
You have a stain...

611
01:08:55,421 --> 01:08:56,296
on your shirt.

612
01:08:59,713 --> 01:09:01,421
Very well spotted, Ms. Detergent.

613
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,505
We have one option.

614
01:09:49,671 --> 01:09:50,671
Congratulations, boss.

615
01:09:57,713 --> 01:09:58,838
Chop it up finely.

616
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,755
Mr. Artist,
how is your biryani shaping up?

617
01:10:03,838 --> 01:10:06,505
It's coming along great, Farooq.

618
01:10:07,171 --> 01:10:08,880
Smells delicious.

619
01:10:15,463 --> 01:10:18,421
-How is your father doing?
-He's very well.

620
01:10:18,505 --> 01:10:19,505
And your...

621
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,671
-Call the caterer.
-Okay, sir.

622
01:10:31,963 --> 01:10:33,505
There's magic in your hands.

623
01:10:34,713 --> 01:10:37,130
-The boss wants to see you.
-I'll be back.

624
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,671
I want to open a shop in Bhiwandi.

625
01:10:41,463 --> 01:10:43,796
Near the highway. It will be good.

626
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:44,755
Keep an eye out.

627
01:10:45,213 --> 01:10:46,171
Sir.

628
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,963
See me before you go.

629
01:10:50,963 --> 01:10:53,130
You cooked lamb on Bahubali's birthday?

630
01:10:53,921 --> 01:10:54,755
Yes, sir.

631
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:01,296
How will he feel when he sees
his relatives being served up on plates?

632
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:09,713
Hey, do it properly.
Who do you think you are?

633
01:11:10,005 --> 01:11:11,046
All well, Farooq?

634
01:11:11,463 --> 01:11:13,338
He humiliated me in public.

635
01:11:13,421 --> 01:11:14,671
The old man's lost it.

636
01:11:15,921 --> 01:11:17,963
He wants to make his goat a celebrity.

637
01:11:18,546 --> 01:11:19,463
Serve the biryani!

638
01:11:19,546 --> 01:11:21,296
I hear someone's making a film
about the goat.

639
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:26,630
That lunatic has called someone from
a beauty parlor to do the goat's makeup.

640
01:11:26,921 --> 01:11:27,755
Insanity.

641
01:11:27,838 --> 01:11:29,171
Serve the bread.

642
01:11:50,671 --> 01:11:53,671
Please come, buy some fresh meat.

643
01:12:33,671 --> 01:12:35,005
Come on, come on, come on.

644
01:12:39,963 --> 01:12:43,380
This is great. We meet again, so soon.

645
01:12:44,755 --> 01:12:48,046
I just felt like doing the rounds
of the market.

646
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,213
-He looks meaty.
-Yes.

647
01:12:54,296 --> 01:12:56,046
He has three toes.

648
01:12:56,713 --> 01:12:57,838
It's a miracle.

649
01:12:57,921 --> 01:12:59,713
Such goats bring luck.

650
01:13:00,046 --> 01:13:02,505
We sure do need some...

651
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:06,338
-See you. I need to finish loading up.
-Okay.

652
01:13:28,546 --> 01:13:30,546
TAKE ACTION, IF YOU DARE

653
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:32,255
IF NOT, ENDURE

654
01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:38,963
Yes?

655
01:13:40,588 --> 01:13:42,546
They called me to do makeup.

656
01:13:42,921 --> 01:13:43,755
Come in.

657
01:13:58,505 --> 01:13:59,338
This way.

658
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:13,505
Wait here.

659
01:14:34,046 --> 01:14:35,296
Hey, Ms. Beauty Parlor.

660
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:42,213
Hey, man. What are you doing?
Hurry up and deal the cards.

661
01:14:43,005 --> 01:14:47,713
The queen evaded me in this game,
otherwise I was going to win.

662
01:14:48,921 --> 01:14:50,546
Shuffle it properly.

663
01:15:02,671 --> 01:15:06,171
-Is he dangerous?
-Not at all. He's as docile as a cow.

664
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:08,713
Do a good job. Make the boss happy.

665
01:15:11,046 --> 01:15:14,588
I need some hot water in a bowl.

666
01:16:50,546 --> 01:16:52,880
-Open the door.
-It has a padlock.

667
01:16:58,130 --> 01:16:59,005
What are you doing?

668
01:17:00,046 --> 01:17:02,130
You said every lock has a heart.

669
01:17:02,546 --> 01:17:04,630
-I'm trying to hear its--
-Don't even try.

670
01:17:06,171 --> 01:17:07,130
Got a hairpin?

671
01:17:07,921 --> 01:17:08,755
Yes.

672
01:17:08,838 --> 01:17:09,796
Put it in the keyhole.

673
01:17:12,713 --> 01:17:13,546
Now what?

674
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:15,838
Leave it to fate.

675
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:20,130
Call me when you're done.

676
01:18:26,338 --> 01:18:27,171
Yes, man.

677
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:31,546
I am in for ten.

678
01:18:32,005 --> 01:18:33,630
-His move.
-Five from me, blind.

679
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:34,963
I am in for five too.

680
01:18:36,838 --> 01:18:40,963
The makeup will take
about half an hour to set.

681
01:18:41,588 --> 01:18:44,046
-Please don't touch him until then.
-Okay.

682
01:18:47,046 --> 01:18:47,880
Listen...

683
01:18:50,088 --> 01:18:51,255
The door is this way.

684
01:18:52,421 --> 01:18:53,671
Five from me.

685
01:18:53,963 --> 01:18:56,046
-I am in for blind.
-Me too. Do it over.

686
01:19:39,213 --> 01:19:40,380
You were right.

687
01:19:41,463 --> 01:19:44,255
Everyone steals something
at some point in their life.

688
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:19,296
My heart soars like a kite

689
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:23,421
Colored by a rainbow

690
01:20:24,046 --> 01:20:29,630
The skies open up

691
01:20:29,713 --> 01:20:32,630
I find clouds

692
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:37,421
That enchant me

693
01:20:37,505 --> 01:20:41,630
I don't know where I'm headed

694
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:46,213
It's a secret I can't fathom

695
01:20:47,421 --> 01:20:50,796
I don't recognize myself

696
01:20:51,130 --> 01:20:53,005
This heart of mine

697
01:20:55,338 --> 01:20:56,713
Has become a stranger

698
01:21:04,213 --> 01:21:07,255
We should make the call now.

699
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:14,046
Death is inevitable, it will come one day

700
01:21:14,296 --> 01:21:17,796
Life will fade away,
It will happen one day

701
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,546
Why fear such things

702
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:23,296
Who knows what tomorrow--

703
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:24,213
Stop!

704
01:21:27,963 --> 01:21:28,921
I have Bahubali.

705
01:21:29,005 --> 01:21:31,088
You have no idea
what you're getting into--

706
01:21:32,463 --> 01:21:34,921
Listen to me closely.

707
01:21:35,005 --> 01:21:38,213
Or the next time you see Bahubali,
he will be floating in sauce.

708
01:21:39,713 --> 01:21:44,255
I want you to return the i10 you stole
near the Mahalakshmi temple.

709
01:22:04,546 --> 01:22:05,963
Sir, do you want me to sing?

710
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:08,338
Bloody hell!

711
01:22:14,546 --> 01:22:15,463
ABODE OF MERCY

712
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:35,838
Please pay me today.

713
01:22:44,421 --> 01:22:46,171
What's this goat doing here?

714
01:22:50,296 --> 01:22:55,046
This guy steals a Mercedes
from Fayyaz Qureshi...

715
01:22:57,796 --> 01:22:59,546
All he wants in exchange is an i10.

716
01:23:03,213 --> 01:23:04,713
Whoever he is...

717
01:23:06,088 --> 01:23:07,421
he's a lunatic.

718
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:14,713
Boss.

719
01:23:19,421 --> 01:23:20,713
That's all I know, sir.

720
01:23:22,546 --> 01:23:23,463
Honestly.

721
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,380
Where does this Artist live?

722
01:23:30,671 --> 01:23:33,421
I don't know, sir.
He's just an acquaintance.

723
01:24:02,338 --> 01:24:04,505
-Yes, tell me.
-Mr. Artist?

724
01:24:20,671 --> 01:24:23,171
Hey, UK. I need a ticket immediately.

725
01:24:28,171 --> 01:24:29,630
...you aren't the only goat here.

726
01:24:30,421 --> 01:24:32,421
I too have eaten grass all my life.

727
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:38,171
The difference is, you're a fighting goat
and I am a scapegoat.

728
01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:48,255
Pack your bags in ten minutes,
and meet me at CST station.

729
01:24:48,671 --> 01:24:49,671
Where are we going?

730
01:24:49,755 --> 01:24:52,005
Not us. Just you. Back to your parents.

731
01:24:55,671 --> 01:24:56,671
What about Bahubali?

732
01:24:57,380 --> 01:24:58,505
I'll take care of him.

733
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:00,963
They are onto us.

734
01:25:02,338 --> 01:25:05,546
It's not just about the car anymore.
It's gotten serious.

735
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:37,296
You live off loose change, right?

736
01:25:38,713 --> 01:25:39,755
Now, eat it.

737
01:25:47,838 --> 01:25:48,713
Let's go.

738
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:37,588
-Where were you?
-I've been looking all over for you.

739
01:27:39,046 --> 01:27:40,796
-Where does it arrive?
-Platform two.

740
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:42,130
See you.

741
01:28:00,796 --> 01:28:04,796
The number you have dialed
has either been switched off or--

742
01:28:23,255 --> 01:28:24,505
There he is!

743
01:29:04,171 --> 01:29:06,463
Search there! Boss is going...

744
01:29:07,755 --> 01:29:09,005
What are you people doing?

745
01:29:09,796 --> 01:29:11,213
Listen to me. Okay.

746
01:29:11,755 --> 01:29:13,088
Hey. What is it?

747
01:29:15,213 --> 01:29:16,796
Hey, listen!

748
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:21,255
Hang up.

749
01:29:27,171 --> 01:29:28,880
When you find him, bring him here.

750
01:29:31,755 --> 01:29:32,713
Call me.

751
01:29:42,130 --> 01:29:46,005
Death is inevitable

752
01:29:46,088 --> 01:29:49,713
It will happen someday

753
01:29:49,796 --> 01:29:53,880
Life will fade

754
01:29:54,088 --> 01:29:57,421
It will happen someday

755
01:29:58,838 --> 01:30:02,380
Why fear such things

756
01:30:02,463 --> 01:30:06,046
There's no need to be afraid

757
01:30:07,171 --> 01:30:11,546
No one knows

758
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:14,671
What tomorrow will bring

759
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:21,005
No one knows

760
01:30:21,088 --> 01:30:25,005
What tomorrow will bring

761
01:30:42,088 --> 01:30:42,921
Boss.

762
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,963
It wasn't my intention to hurt you...

763
01:31:33,088 --> 01:31:35,005
or to humiliate you.

764
01:31:36,921 --> 01:31:39,213
I just wanted you to realize how it feels

765
01:31:40,630 --> 01:31:46,296
when someone steals an object
you love dearly.

766
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:52,921
I know you're very angry.

767
01:31:54,838 --> 01:31:58,463
That's exactly how I felt
when I realized someone had stolen my car.

768
01:32:02,463 --> 01:32:04,046
I bought it that very day.

769
01:32:07,213 --> 01:32:09,005
Even the police wouldn't help me.

770
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:10,505
And convincing you was...

771
01:32:13,755 --> 01:32:15,296
That's why we took Bahubali...

772
01:32:23,171 --> 01:32:27,713
But then I realized
that he's not an object,

773
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:30,213
he's like your child.

774
01:32:33,088 --> 01:32:34,838
I just lost my car.

775
01:32:36,671 --> 01:32:38,505
It's all right if I don't get it back.

776
01:32:49,921 --> 01:32:51,130
Give me her car keys.

777
01:33:22,463 --> 01:33:23,296
It's for...

778
01:33:58,046 --> 01:34:00,171
Nirma took everyone to the cleaners today.

779
01:34:19,505 --> 01:34:21,338
Bahubali will not fight anymore.

780
01:34:33,713 --> 01:34:36,130
Please remove these... from the seats.

781
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,505
-Where do you want to go?
-Where my fate leads me.

782
01:35:03,338 --> 01:35:04,213
You're an idiot.

783
01:35:08,005 --> 01:35:09,588
Now I can cuss in...

784
01:35:23,713 --> 01:35:24,588
Hey, listen.

785
01:35:25,713 --> 01:35:28,505
Don't forget to invite me
to your restaurant opening.

786
01:36:13,005 --> 01:36:16,213
I find something new inside of me

787
01:36:17,588 --> 01:36:20,755
Something has changed

788
01:36:20,838 --> 01:36:24,171
What is happening to me?

789
01:36:25,671 --> 01:36:28,796
I find something new inside of me

790
01:36:30,255 --> 01:36:33,171
Something has changed

791
01:36:33,671 --> 01:36:37,463
What is happening to me?

792
01:36:38,796 --> 01:36:41,380
I'm drenched by a rainbow

793
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:45,630
It feels like in this world

794
01:36:46,088 --> 01:36:52,046
I see an eighth color

795
01:37:40,505 --> 01:37:44,546
Mom, don't worry.
There's always an option.

796
01:38:34,213 --> 01:38:36,588
Welcome to...

797
01:38:43,463 --> 01:38:45,421
Our next...

798
01:38:46,963 --> 01:38:51,380
...impressed me with his unique manner
during auditions.

799
01:38:56,505 --> 01:38:59,130
Are you a professional cook or...

800
01:39:00,921 --> 01:39:03,255
Then, what's your...

801
01:39:03,796 --> 01:39:05,463
My work involves locks.

802
01:39:06,130 --> 01:39:07,088
Locks?
