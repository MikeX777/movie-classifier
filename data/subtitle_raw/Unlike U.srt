1
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:58,004
In my opinion BerIin has a Iot of
different faces and different styIes.

2
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,406
However, you can cIearIy
distinguish stuffthat is from BerIin.

3
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,926
The characters are more aIive.

4
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,606
They reaIIy are aIive, as ifthey
are moving on their own.

5
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,319
Not Iike a stamp, but more as
ifthey are dancing up front.

6
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,399
20 minutes..ok

7
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,479
...in so Iong?

8
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,319
Yes..

9
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,888
Ok...

10
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,919
20 minutes are over...

11
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,488
Yes...Ok...

12
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,284
Get down!
There is a train.

13
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,439
It's an awesome feeIing.

14
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,440
To see the train arriving and
there is a reaIIy phat piece on it.

15
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,646
And if it's reaIIy
nice and coIourfuI...

16
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,763
...then i just did it on time.

17
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,366
Let me put it this way, graffiti on
trains is the reaI deaI. That's the shit.

18
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,368
That's how it aII started - on trains!

19
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,567
It is because here in BerIin we have
foIks that are painting trains

20
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,239
and onIy trains for twenty years.

21
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,957
I wouId caII them
cIassic trainbombers.

22
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,679
This is what makes BerIin the
''New York of Europe''.

23
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,119
Every chiId at the age of 6 or 8
can do such things.

24
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,239
There is nothing to it.

25
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,479
This is unesthetic and
an absoIute no go.

26
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,399
It was in 84 or 85 I guess,

27
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,239
when I saw these two movies.
''Beatstreet'' and ''WiIdstyIe''

28
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,439
WeII, because ofthose movies,
I thought had to try it too.

29
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,157
It just had to be this way.

30
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,199
This must be so much fun. Spraying
here, the peopIe over there...

31
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,839
...and there is the train,
roIIing with speed!

32
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,399
What I saw there reaIIy is Iike TV.
Monkey sees, monkey does...

33
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,719
..that was how I feIt and I thought,
monkey does it right!

34
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,605
So I onIy wanted to do this
and nothing eIse.

35
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,679
I used to paint aII my Iife.

36
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,839
I can remember when I was
about 5 years oId

37
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,399
and having a pen and some
paper in my hands.

38
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,439
And unIike the others I just
had to paint non-stop.

39
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,043
I never enjoyed
other things as much.

40
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,406
So I put aII of my energy into it

41
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,842
and started to convert my
energy into paintings.

42
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,479
Comics, Iike ''CIever and Smart''
had some funky characters

43
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,958
and I was fascinated.

44
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,925
WeII, in '84
I started to paint Ietters.

45
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,759
I guess we were the onIy ones
or the first ones in the city

46
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,799
who were painting coIourfuI or
even siIver pieces everywhere.

47
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,239
The first time I noticed graffiti
was through a friend.

48
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,400
It was during the era
of ''Breakdance''.

49
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,759
AII the Hip Hop stuff
suddenIy arrived.

50
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,647
He suggested to
go outside and paint.

51
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,808
So we wanted to do Graffiti,

52
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,398
but we did not reaIIy have a cIue
what graffiti actuaIIy was about.

53
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,679
It was a smooth transition.

54
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,559
In the beginning
it was on a piece of paper,

55
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,239
Iater at a streetcorner
or at schooI.

56
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,719
I did not reaIize the
moment when it reaIIy kicked off.

57
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,799
Some months Iater
I made some contacts

58
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,119
and suddenIy I was
part ofthe ''Graffiti Scene''.

59
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,599
Back then, when I was
heading through the city,

60
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,283
aII those characters and paintings
were chasing me Iike crazy.

61
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,999
I was so deepIy fascinated
by those pictures

62
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,807
that I had to start painting too.

63
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,166
I beIieve, my motivation
was to break out.

64
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,681
To break out from
the restraints ofour society

65
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,078
and to be part of
something extraordinary.

66
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,679
In the beginning there was
no particuIar motivation

67
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,203
to start doing graffiti.

68
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,884
We were pIaying around, trying to
test our boundaries I guess.

69
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,839
The impuIse came from the
possibiIity to push oneseIfto the top.

70
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,922
Yes, you reaIIy can achieve
something in the worId of graffiti.

71
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,599
You do not depend on no one
eIse but yourseIf.

72
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,363
You can spread your name
and you can do it

73
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,606
whenever, wherever
and however you want.

74
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,647
Of course painting a train
is something different.

75
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,767
InfIuenced by New York...

76
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,238
SuddenIy art is coming to you.

77
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,166
UsuaIIy you wouId have to go to
the museum to appreciate art.

78
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,919
Now it's the other way around,
art is coming to you!

79
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,645
Ofcourse, writing is fun and it is
nice to earn some respect

80
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,960
from friends and other peopIe.

81
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,639
But at the end ofthe day the
mission itseIf is important to me

82
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,561
and to stay up aII night.

83
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,599
Characters in motion do beIong
on trains that are roIIing.

84
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,488
They need a surface that
is in motion.

85
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,799
This is the most beautifuI thing for
a writer to accompIish.

86
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,323
However not everyone is abIe
to paint graffiti on a train.

87
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,519
I was motivated since I wanted
to Iive the adventure.

88
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,407
PIaying the cat-and-mouse-game
in the tunneIs.

89
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,878
Doing iIIegaI things
that you aren't supposed to do.

90
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,641
And the positive side effect was

91
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,966
that we were abIe to
totaIIy express our creativity.

92
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,924
As a matter offact the iIIegaI nature
ofgraffiti is important to me.

93
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,683
Otherwise anybody
couId do the same.

94
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,967
We are doing it
because of its myth.

95
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,358
It carries some kind
of secret within

96
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,324
and I think this wouId get Iost
ifeverybody wouId do it.

97
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:13,320
I can't understand why he was
pushing himseIf into it Iike that.

98
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,639
With aII its negative consequences
for the everyday Iife...

99
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,799
AII those charges being
pressed against him,

100
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,687
the money he had to pay...

101
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,199
I can't teII what forces someone

102
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,279
to set their aIarm at one
or two o'cIock in the morning

103
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,167
and go out in the coId.
To go somewhere...

104
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,319
AIways being afraid of
getting caught.

105
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,286
AIways watching out...

106
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:45,079
AIthough you know that you shouId
actuaIIy go to work the next morning.

107
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,926
Even Stefan couId not expIain
what his motivation is.

108
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,485
I think he didn't have a
specific motivation.

109
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,166
He just did it.

110
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,605
He did it in his own
very radicaI approach.

111
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,679
I was aIways impressed that he
went for it in such a radicaI manner.

112
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,359
ActuaIIy I'm stiII impressed,

113
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,279
otherwise he couIdn't have
reached his status

114
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,439
and couIdn't have achieved
what he did achieve.

115
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,839
He achieved aII this because he
went for it aII or nothing.

116
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,682
He had no fear of Iosses.

117
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,247
In this speciaI worId
he aIways was my roIe modeI.

118
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,124
On the other hand, he had no cIue
how to handIe everyday Iife.

119
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,157
So in the reaI worId he couIdn't
be my roIe modeI.

120
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,959
I beIieve the ''crew thing''
was adopted as weII.

121
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,679
Like a characteristic thing that
comes aIong with graffiti or hip hop.

122
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,679
To aIIie oneseIfwith others
heIps to attract more attention

123
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,559
and resuIts in more power.

124
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,559
Graffiti brought the ''crew thing'' to
Germany and we absorbed it.

125
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,519
It just makes so much more sense
to go out with 5 or 6 friends

126
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,079
and to spread a name.

127
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,199
The name can become so
much more famous

128
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,201
than ifyou wouId do it
aII on your own.

129
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,439
Wanna make troubIe?

130
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,559
You don't get any further.

131
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,759
Wanna make troubIe?

132
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,806
You don't get any further.

133
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,079
There is the advantage that you can
approach much Iarger projects.

134
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,921
You are one unit.

135
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,401
If probIems arise you can soIve
them together with your crew.

136
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,719
Being a unit is one of
our biggest advantages.

137
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,319
And to have so many
peopIe that support us

138
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,207
in so many ways is a
very important asset.

139
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,598
...the driver is having a nap inside...

140
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,319
Coming back home
after painting a train

141
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,439
just makes you
feeI very pIeased.

142
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,361
Everything is so much more fun,
you know...

143
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,639
It's a sociaI event to go out
at night and to experience things.

144
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,959
Things other peopIe wiII never
encounter in their whoIe Iife.

145
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,639
The peopIe you hang out with and
paint graffiti with...

146
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,719
You grow cIoser to them,

147
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,198
since it's an extraordinary
experience.

148
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,479
You are entering a tunneI, you are
commiting a crime together,

149
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,481
you are trespassing...

150
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,599
There is so much shit happening
that makes you grow cIoser together

151
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,442
and a crew is
automaticaIIy formed on its own.

152
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,558
Being aIone or with
onIy a few peopIe

153
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,879
attracts Iess attention.

154
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
Less noise wiII occur

155
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,802
and most ofthe time
you wiII be faster.

156
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,519
On the other hand
a Iarge group of peopIe

157
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,119
reduces the risk

158
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,405
ofgetting caught for each individuaI.

159
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,402
You can escape much better,
because...

160
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,843
for obvious reasons.

161
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,919
RivaIry and competition,
that,s what it is aII about.

162
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,478
Without this it wouId
onIy be chicken-Iike.

163
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,846
You don't get compIiments
from writers very often.

164
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,887
I'm someone who doesn't
compIiment other peopIe a Iot.

165
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,799
I don't want to show peopIe
how bad they are.

166
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,759
I actuaIIy want to make the
eager and show them

167
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,647
that they can be even better.

168
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,719
Some writers aim to create
the best characters possibIe

169
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,479
and do nothing eIse
aII day Iong.

170
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,359
Others prefer to bomb some 500
pieces on trains

171
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,399
onIy in chrome and bIack
in a year or Iess.

172
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,128
That is up to each ones
personaI preference.

173
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,719
I beIieve it's an art in itseIf
to have Iots of pieces.

174
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,439
Even though it's very simpIe and
considered ugIy by outsiders.

175
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,679
The art is to have
your name everywhere.

176
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,476
Our approach of bombing is
to be as fast as possibIe.

177
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,398
We started this way
because it's safest.

178
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,879
The most important thing
is the quaIity ofyour pieces.

179
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,239
It doesn't matter ifyou are bombing
or painting in a haII offame.

180
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,639
Ifyou did a good job
peopIe wiII show you respect.

181
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,599
This is Iike reIeasing an aIbum.

182
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,159
What's the point of
reIeasing ten rap aIbums

183
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,799
ifthey end up at the back ofa
rummage tabIe for 50 cents.

184
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,479
ReIease one cooI aIbum which
you can seII on Ebay for 100  !

185
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,367
You know what I mean...
compare it yourseIf.

186
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,845
I beIieve that you have to provide
both, quaIity and quantity.

187
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,759
Most ofthem are bombers
and want respect for that.

188
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,159
However most ofthe time
they don't get any respect.

189
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,320
In order to get respect
you reaIIy have to be good.

190
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,996
There's no quaIity without
the respective quantity.

191
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,758
I beIieve in fast and easy things.

192
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,398
Preparation, hard work and
strategic thinking are a huge part of it.

193
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,479
In my opinion, writers that are
reaIIy committed to painting trains,

194
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,878
are very smart peopIe.

195
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,397
They invent new ways to
reduce the probIems invoIved.

196
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,679
You definiteIy need to have a pIan,
know how everything works,

197
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,158
how to be safe and to know
whatever can happen to you.

198
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,519
Sometimes you may
receive a caII at work

199
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,839
and five minutes Iater you are
running home, grabbing three cans

200
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,079
and spontaneousIy start
to spray somewhere.

201
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,359
The next time I may be preparing
myseIffor a whoIe month,

202
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,719
buying the cans a few
weeks in advance

203
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,959
and making some 70 sketches.

204
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,608
There's no fixed scheme.

205
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,326
I aIways paint waIIs freestyIe.

206
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,479
But trains...

207
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,239
I aIways start offwith a sketch.
This way I can save a Iot oftime.

208
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,039
Back in the days the preparation
was more much intense.

209
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,719
Today it's an everyday-routine.

210
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,243
There's not as much
preparation invoIved anymore.

211
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,839
WeII...
What makes a good train?

212
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,559
Most importantIy the train
has to be on track somewhere!

213
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,199
Other factors are
the way it was painted,

214
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,999
the chaIIenge and
the rush of adrenaIin.

215
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,524
The train has to be on track...
there we go.

216
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,959
In my opinion, a piece
on a train shouId be IegibIe.

217
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,719
The piece has got
to be cIear and readabIe,

218
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,119
especiaIIy since the goaI is
to spread your name.

219
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,519
Ifyou can't read the Ietters and
the train is gone in ten seconds,

220
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,600
you've compIeteIy
missed your target.

221
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,965
The outIines must be cIear.

222
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,519
You've got to make the
Ietters dance on their own

223
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,599
Iike a b-boy-character

224
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,805
without adding
any arrows or bars!

225
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,439
To me the three
characteristics ofa good train

226
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,839
are its styIe,
the originaIity ofthe background

227
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,441
and the coIours and the accuracy.

228
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,439
A good styIe
must be innovative.

229
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,999
It has to be a styIe of its own,
identifiabIe from a distance,

230
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,279
it doesn't matter
which Ietters were painted.

231
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,919
This doesn't come
at the push of a button.

232
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,559
But sooner or Iater
you'II get it down.

233
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,197
It's important to be abIe
to put your personaIity into it.

234
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,079
A good train is aIive!

235
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,399
It's not Iike putting together
any random Ietters.

236
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,199
Make it aIive!

237
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,439
There shouId be an
atmosphere surrounding it.

238
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,879
You have to be abIe to feeI that
the train is not onIy covered by paint,

239
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,999
but that someone has
invested their souI

240
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,399
in order to deIight others.

241
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,559
Nowadays these trains
are quite rare.

242
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,279
Back in the days
every train had its own styIe.

243
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,405
Like in wonderIand.

244
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,725
Writing a train
is simpIy the reaI deaI.

245
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,519
This is why back then
at Friedrichstrasse

246
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,089
it feIt Iike
absoIuteIy the reaI thing.

247
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,479
The writers corner at Friedrichstr.
was initiated by a smaII group,

248
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,519
mostIy guys of
the crews ''AGS'' and ''GFA''.

249
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,079
They first met there,
because this station

250
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,319
was the border between
the east and west of BerIin

251
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,119
which was open day and night.

252
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,848
You couId hang out there 24/7.

253
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,481
I'd say that the writers corner
existed from 1989 to 1996.

254
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,120
You have to be aware that
during these years

255
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,000
this was the meeting point for
different generations ofwriters...

256
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,601
This was a pIace where
you couId see painted trains.

257
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,039
There was aIways
someone around.

258
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,479
There was aIways some action.
Anytime!

259
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,519
We went from station to station.

260
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,679
The stations next to Friedrichstr.
were in the eastern part of BerIin

261
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,599
they weren't in use and therefore
Iocked off by the authorities.

262
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,169
The trains onIy passed
through, but didn't stop.

263
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,359
The security guards and the cops
were aIways on site.

264
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,759
But we couIdn't care Iess.

265
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,238
We took the piss
out ofthem.

266
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,282
Mr. Fag...

267
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,762
Mr. Fag...

268
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,399
It was aIways Iike pIaying the
cat-and-mouse game.

269
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,159
They knew what was going on and
we never made a secret out of it.

270
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,439
We spoke out openIy.

271
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,999
Everyone knew that Friedrichstr.
was the writers meeting point.

272
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,759
It was wideIy accepted.

273
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,919
It took a Iong time
untiI things changed,

274
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,478
and they onIy changed because
there were so many of us.

275
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,439
You don't want to be in our fiIm,
right? OK, so we won't shoot.

276
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,043
This is the trick of reporters.

277
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,923
When you get up, we go to sIeep.

278
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,839
We couId do whatever we wanted.

279
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,879
In the beginning we'd just paint
the trains as they arrived.

280
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,359
PeopIe didn't care at aII.

281
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,724
There were more important things
to worry about than graffiti.

282
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,286
The German Democratic RepubIic
was coIIapsing

283
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,199
the peopIe were afraid
of Iosing their IiveIihood.

284
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,639
We just took
advantage ofthe situation.

285
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,279
Ifwe had some action
going on Iater that night

286
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,119
we wouId get up
at 10 or 12 am.

287
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,678
Just to go there and
check out the situation.

288
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,518
Around 12 am we'd meet
some guys who'd skipped schooI,

289
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,640
...steaI some spray cans and
tag our names around.

290
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,206
Later we'd hang out at a friends
pIace and prepare for the night.

291
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,039
Yo, yo, aII in red!

292
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,927
We had dinner and
did some sketches.

293
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,559
Later we'd meet at Friedrichstr.

294
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,719
to paint trains or whatever.

295
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,159
ActuaIIy it didn't make
a difference what we painted.

296
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,797
AII we had in our hands
were markers and cans.

297
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,399
Friedrichstr. was such an
important part ofour Iives

298
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,359
and everybody feIt it the same way.

299
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,719
Something was happening,

300
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,402
this was our time, our train station.

301
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,680
We had the power of our youth,

302
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,279
the ideaIism,

303
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,599
and the wiII to change things.

304
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,919
We made dreams come true.

305
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,762
For us, the peopIe of BerIin!
Our dreams!

306
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,439
AII ofthe trains were painted

307
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,566
and in the end aII ofthem
were on track.

308
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,839
Are you coming with us, or what?
-Yes, we want to go with you.

309
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,205
CouId you just hang on a moment?
We are from West Germany.

310
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,159
Yes, just hurry up.

311
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,479
Thanks, this is very kind
ofyou young Iady.

312
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,159
It just happened.

313
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,718
We were very Iucky that we
couId make the best out of it.

314
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,124
These are the cops, Maxim.
You know about 2 to 3 men.

315
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,119
We did everything in front of
the poIice and the security guards.

316
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,961
Ofcourse some guys got caught.

317
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,759
Day and night peopIe were there.

318
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,799
So it was just normaI
that someone was caught.

319
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,846
That was part ofthe game.

320
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,799
Beat it! Run away, dude.

321
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,288
Have a Iook.
Cops aII over the pIace.

322
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,479
They knew ifyou were caught,

323
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,079
haIfan hour Iater
you wouId be reIeased

324
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,285
and go back to
Friedrichstr. again.

325
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,840
Here, this one is a cop as weII.
-You bastard!

326
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,479
I beIieve that back then the BerIin
as we know it was founded.

327
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,367
It's a ''graffiti megacity''!

328
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,959
And one very essentiaI thing
was the corner at Friedrichstr..

329
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,684
It's a huge thing that we decided
to paint trains instead ofwaIIs.

330
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,999
We were hanging out
there day and night.

331
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,967
Everything took pIace in the tube.

332
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,123
I beIieve it was the time ofour Iives

333
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,083
and it'II never be the same again.

334
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,079
Rest in Peace MAXIM !

335
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,679
A Iot ofthings can happen
when you paint trains in BerIin.

336
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,008
Some peopIe
want to arrest you,

337
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,924
others wiII hit you with a cIub.

338
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,519
You have to be
aware ofthe danger

339
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,203
and how, where
and what you're doing.

340
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,560
There are a Iot of risks invoIved.

341
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,319
WeII I'm aIways Iooking
for good spots.

342
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,359
I'm riding trains a Iot,
visiting different pIaces

343
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,326
and investing a Iot oftime.

344
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,759
We observe the spots
a few days before.

345
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,965
And then it's a matter of instinct.

346
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,479
Ifwe have a good feeIing we'II do it.

347
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,958
Otherwise we don't
or we do it even faster.

348
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,279
You sort of have it in your bIood

349
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,959
after Iooking for spots again
and again year after year.

350
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,120
You'II get a feeIing for what's
possibIe and what's not.

351
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,637
Back then and even today I don't
find it hard to find spots

352
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,879
because I never
needed a Iot oftime.

353
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,199
In the haII of fame
you have a Iot oftime.

354
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,119
You don't even know
what to do with aII your time.

355
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,679
You can paint a thousand arrows,
500 connections,

356
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,203
3000 Backgrounds, Designs.
Whatever you wanna do...

357
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,999
But painting a train?

358
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,959
You have three coIours,
7 minutes, maybe 15 or 20.

359
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,799
You make the best use
ofyour time.

360
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,324
You are Iooking for the most
interesting spot as weII.

361
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,999
Time is the key.

362
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,115
The first thing we discuss isn't the
spot, but how much time we have!

363
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,759
So that we know what to take,
and we think in categories of

364
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,602
10, 20, 30, 40 or 40+ minutes.

365
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,482
It aII depends.

366
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,879
Back in the days there was
so much time in the trainyards

367
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,679
during the time that
the trains were out ofservice

368
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,759
AII the Iights were off
and everything was dark.

369
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,319
So there was onIy the train and you.

370
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,287
In theory you couId've
driven away with the train.

371
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,319
Back then we had parties in the
trainyards with around 30 peopIe.

372
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,599
We painted the trains
back to front and inside out.

373
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,799
We were totaIIy drunk,
I mean compIeteIy wasted.

374
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,199
That's what partying in
the yards was aII about.

375
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,519
Back then it was
much easier than it is today.

376
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,359
I once did a whoIecar in Erkner.

377
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,239
I didn't even know
what ''fat caps'' are.

378
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,359
I was fiIIing out everything
with ''skinny caps''.

379
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,119
We caIIed them ''Boss-caps''

380
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,079
Because we took them
from Boss deodorant.

381
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,279
I don't think there's
a singIe spot out there

382
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,678
where someone can paint
a whoIecar for six hours.

383
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,399
In generaI you can't teII
how much time you've got.

384
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,639
It depends on the Iocation.

385
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,919
Ifyou're weII prepared
you can get haIfan hour for trains,

386
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,727
maybe even 45 minutes.

387
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,679
There is a huge
amount ofwork invoIved

388
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,965
and the risk is increasing
year by year.

389
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,043
The Iack oftime
has a positive effect on me.

390
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,519
I feeI chaIIenged to create
something reaIIy good

391
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,362
in the short amount oftime
that's avaiIabIe.

392
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,839
When I started
peopIe use to say that

393
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,519
soon painting underground trains
wiII not be possibIe anymore.

394
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,119
In 2009 more underground trains
were painted than ever before.

395
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,839
It fluctuates,
you can't reaIIy teII.

396
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,920
You have to put effort into it
in order to achieve your goaI.

397
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,639
ActuaIIy we started
by bombing on the street

398
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,319
and Iater
we started bombing trains.

399
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,839
We puIIed the emergency brake
in the middIe ofthe train station,

400
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,679
started to paint whoIe cars

401
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,959
and ran away
before anyone couId interfere.

402
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,438
In fact this aII derives
from street bombing.

403
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,438
Our motto is ''in your face''.
We're organized and very boId.

404
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,517
We do our thing and
disappear into thin air.

405
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,318
The cops need at Ieast
3 minutes untiI they arrive.

406
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,079
It's been a Iong time since
i considered the poIice my friend.

407
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,047
As a chiId I wanted to
become a poIice officer.

408
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,282
This was way before
I became a writer.

409
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,879
In the meantime the poIice became
something to be wary of.

410
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:25,036
We are famiIiar with each other
in a way, but we avoid them.

411
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,919
But I don't have
a probIem with them.

412
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,887
I know they're doing theirjob
and we're doing ours.

413
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,159
In 1994 a
speciaI investigations unit caIIed

414
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,604
''gemeinsame ErmittIungsgruppe
Graffiti'' was estabIished.

415
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,839
Graffiti crime started
to take over in Europe

416
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,399
and especiaIIy in BerIin
it became huge.

417
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,605
So the poIice had to react.

418
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,721
GIB is short for ''Graffiti in BerIin''
and is run by a bunch of...

419
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,444
...hmm no cIue,
intoIerant peopIe maybe.

420
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,324
I'II put it this way, it wouId
be better ifthey wouIdn't exist.

421
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,319
We consist of
approximateIy 20 poIice officers.

422
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,639
Ofcourse as an administrative unit
from time to time

423
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,436
we have to save money and
therefore this number fluctuates.

424
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,803
We couId easiIy do
with more officers on the job.

425
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,569
The GIB is what we
consider a speciaI task force.

426
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,519
These are the foIks that
give us a hard time at night

427
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,079
but on the other hand
they aIso sit at a desk

428
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,808
and study our pictures
in the daytime.

429
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,959
Our officers are very famiIiar
with the subject.

430
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,404
They know the scene,
and the nature ofgraffiti.

431
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,319
They are weII aware of
its weight as evidence.

432
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,567
Apart from that we work
Iike any other poIice unit.

433
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,079
We fiIe charges,
try to spot the deIinquents

434
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,047
and forward our resuIts to the
state prosecution office.

435
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,399
I must admit...

436
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,719
they are reaIIy
weII trained on the subject.

437
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,439
They know exactIy who is
hanging around with whom

438
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,486
and every name and so on.

439
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,519
We visit the same spots,
meeting points and events

440
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,646
where we expect
the deIinquents to be.

441
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,165
Thus we gain as much insight
and information as possibIe.

442
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,679
They observe and study us
and try to prove our giIt...

443
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,680
...by chasing us and stuff.

444
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:19,837
Yes, you'II get to know each other
ifyou've been active for a whiIe.

445
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,003
WeII, you have to expect
to run into them

446
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,519
when you go
to paint a train.

447
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,479
Or even to see them
hanging around somewhere,

448
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,079
checking out our spots or sniffing
for fresh paint in subway tunneIs.

449
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,444
WeII, they are
aII over the pIace at night.

450
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,118
Back in the days I was
in the ''GrunewaId'' yard

451
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,519
and the speciaI task force
was there too.

452
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,119
We spotted them and
I recognized their car.

453
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,079
We tagged our names
on the car and hid away again

454
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,319
They were totaIIy pissed off
and drove away.

455
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,959
PeopIe were taIking a Iot about the
GIB, where they might be,

456
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,959
that you have to
be aware and so forth.

457
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,599
I never gave a shit
about that

458
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,726
and I beIieve the other members
ofour crew didn't as weII.

459
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,479
Since 1994 we've noticed
their reactions,

460
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,679
we couId detect
that they were aware of us.

461
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,999
This is what usuaIIy happens
when a speciaI task unit is founded

462
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,967
and speciaIises
on a certain phenomenon.

463
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,639
We had a certain success
of resoIving the crimes.

464
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,319
The scene couId feeI this
and we noticed

465
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,039
that our unit was respected

466
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,719
and were sometimes even feared.

467
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,766
There certainIy
was an impact.

468
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,199
Back then we didn't go out
to paint wearing masks.

469
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,159
Nowadays everybody wears masks
and even use mobiIe phones.

470
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,959
We never had
mobiIe phones back then.

471
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,847
PeopIe have become
a Iot more cautious.

472
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,559
They do a reguIar poIice job
and are overstaffed in my eyes.

473
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,840
They couId and shouId focus
on other more important crime.

474
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,080
In fact the number of
resoIved cases is not that high.

475
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,247
ActuaIIy you can't take
this unit too serious.

476
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,160
It's not that easy to state
an exact rate of resoIved crimes.

477
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,601
City-wide the rate
shouId be around 25 %.

478
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,279
Ifyou're serious about it, you
aren't bothered by the GIB.

479
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,079
You can Iive with it.

480
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,999
Ofcourse there were some peopIe
that couIdn't handIe it so weII.

481
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,879
But apart from them

482
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,679
the GIB was not much ofa
threat to the graffiti scene.

483
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,959
The scene in BerIin is
way too tough-minded

484
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,279
to be distracted by
a unit Iike the GIB.

485
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,439
Now there are cameras,
motion sensors, security-guards

486
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,479
and poIice officers in the train yards.

487
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,119
they hide in the bushes.

488
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,879
Sometimes even
the feds are there as weII.

489
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,839
From time to time
they coIIaborate,

490
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,599
and other times they don't,
therefore it can be very confusing.

491
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,039
You have to take
it aII into consideration.

492
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,079
It's not very easy,
but you adapt to the probIems

493
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,001
and approach
them accordingIy.

494
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,886
We make use
of aII techniques avaiIabIe.

495
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,759
We use CCTV recordings from
train stations and pubIic pIaces.

496
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,799
These were not instaIIed
to fight graffiti crime,

497
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,403
but for other reasons.

498
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,879
But ifthere are any
usefuI CCTV recordings

499
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,597
we'II incIude them
in the investigation.

500
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,479
As weII as traces of DNA on
cans and gIoves or other objects.

501
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,685
We make use offorensic science
and any other suitabIe technique.

502
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,719
We've accepted them.
It's constantIy changing.

503
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,323
We're getting better
and so are they.

504
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,998
Both sides are
constantIy improving.

505
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,962
I don't feeI discouraged.

506
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,639
CCTV is improving and is
compIeteIy accepted by society.

507
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,679
Not just for graffiti,
but actuaIIy against terrorism.

508
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,639
Let me put it this way:
We're onIy painting,

509
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,209
but we wear masks
and couId just as weII be terrorists.

510
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,559
Once we painted
the new government-Iine

511
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,481
and it wasn't easy
to get in there.

512
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,760
-There's the cameras.

513
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,843
You shouId have a good Iawyer.

514
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,799
CIean your cans
and observe the spot weII,

515
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,926
before you do your thing.

516
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,047
The poIice is aIways
one step behind you.

517
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,919
You can aIways reduce
the risk with good preparation,

518
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,443
and good execution.

519
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,879
But there is aIways
a certain risk invoIved

520
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,687
which you can't negIect.

521
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,558
However,
that's the thriII of it.

522
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,239
It's an addiction.
You wanna have some fun

523
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,239
and Iater on you wait
at the station for the train.

524
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,002
You just take the risk.

525
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,724
For me it's
not reaIIy about the thriII.

526
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,604
It'sjust the desire to paint trains.

527
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,802
They have the best surface
avaiIabIe for graffiti.

528
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,439
Painting trains is iIIegaI
so you have to take the risk.

529
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,009
There's no other way.

530
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,159
We got chased so many times
and often nearIy got busted.

531
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,679
These are the most intense
moments. You get so hyped up.

532
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,039
AII you think about is that
you have to come back

533
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,479
to finish the piece.

534
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,239
Once we had to foIIow a train
right to the other side ofthe city.

535
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,718
Just to finish it.

536
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,479
Things Iike that happen.

537
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,242
But the most thriIIing moment
is stiII when you have to run away.

538
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:33,319
I used to consuIt more experienced
writers when it came to trains.

539
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,399
Trainwriting isn't easy.

540
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,479
There are high voItage power Iines

541
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,959
and some peopIe have died
after touching them.

542
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,529
You shouIdn't mess around
with these things.

543
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,642
They expose themseIves to the high
voItage powerIines day and night,

544
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,199
and jump over
fences and tracks

545
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,360
whiIe there's a Iot oftraffic.

546
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,719
They risk so much
onIy to gain fame and respect

547
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,999
by painting dangerous spots.

548
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,479
Every year we record casuaIties
caused by careIess actions.

549
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,606
Even a poIice officer
has died on duty.

550
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,045
He was taking pictures by the tracks
and was struck by a train.

551
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:27,522
You can onIy warn peopIe
not to risk their Iives.

552
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,319
Some peopIe cIimb high buiIdings
onIy to paint a spot

553
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,287
that's considered speciaI.

554
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:41,796
Nowadays you have to finish
your pieces much faster.

555
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,159
Sometimes you do a piece
with someone eIse

556
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,683
in order to finish it
within ten minutes.

557
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,603
Sometimes you even paint a piece
when the train stops at the station

558
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,921
whiIe the passengers
are getting off.

559
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,039
Sometimes you have to wait
for the right moment,

560
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,609
when the security guards are gone.

561
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,607
Maybe you'II have to disabIe
a CCTV camera or stuff Iike that.

562
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,727
However, the security measures
have become much better.

563
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,479
Ifyou're reaIIy into it
you'II find good opportunities.

564
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,163
But the good actions
have become rare.

565
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,679
You have to stay focused.

566
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,363
You reaIIy have to
study the situation carefuIIy,

567
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,045
even if it takes
20 minutes Ionger.

568
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,284
Stay caIm.

569
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,518
You have to put a Iot oftime
into finding a IoophoIe in the system.

570
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,443
Not everyone knows
the ins and outs.

571
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,724
I beIieve that it'II aIways be
possibIe to paint trains.

572
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,758
There'II aIways be an occasion.

573
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,600
It was a Iot offun
pIaying the cat-and-mouse game

574
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,125
since it's quite a fair game to pIay.

575
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,997
I aIways stay on one
spot and it is easy to observe me.

576
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,440
It's a fair trade,
I stay there and Iater I run away

577
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,999
but in the meantime
I've painted a picture that'II stay.

578
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,799
My graffiti shouId entertain
pedestrians, shouId be fun

579
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,323
and shouId be something different.

580
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,919
It's not Iike you're
watching an advertisement.

581
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,887
You don't have to
spend any money.

582
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,119
I wouId put it this way:

583
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:56,042
Graffiti is Iike a coIoured
piece ofshit from a coIoured bird.

584
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:07,324
There was once an info sign
in the tube which said

585
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,999
you can have different opinions
about art and good taste,

586
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,444
but not about vandaIism.

587
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,359
What's art? What's good taste?
What's vandaIism?

588
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,799
VandaIism is a yeIIow train
going around BerIin aII day

589
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,607
with ugIy ads aII over it!

590
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,244
Graffiti to me is both,
art and vandaIism.

591
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,679
Sometimes you paint
a beautifuI piece.

592
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,479
Another time
you're observing a spot for weeks

593
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,599
you notice that the guards
are gone for onIy a minute

594
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,239
and you use
this tiny timeframe

595
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,199
to bomb a siIver piece
in 2 seconds.

596
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,519
Ofcourse it'II be ugIy,
but you're satisfied.

597
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,719
Of course it's sad ifwriters are
tearing up the train seats

598
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,039
and scratching windows.

599
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:02,996
That's not my styIe
and I don't appreciate it either.

600
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,156
Ofcourse it's a form ofart, Iike
caIIigraphy, but on a Iarger scaIe.

601
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,639
This has a Iot to do
with typography.

602
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,439
You're working with different
shapes, surfaces and coIours

603
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,964
and you Iearn
how to work under pressure.

604
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:24,399
Awriter actuaIIy
works a Iot Iike an artist.

605
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,599
The onIy difference is

606
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:30,959
that the artist has
some dipIomas from a schooI

607
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,483
and we graduate
from the streets.

608
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,441
I Iike to create art,

609
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:44,918
something with a certain vaIue.

610
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,119
I don't want to cause
any damage with my graffiti.

611
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,039
That wouId be wrong.

612
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,239
Graffiti is Iike a starter drug into art.

613
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,999
As an artist you do not get
any support from the authorities.

614
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,879
There are very
few youth centers Ieft

615
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,159
and aII they provide
are some oId pooI tabIes.

616
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,799
But who wants
to become a pooI pro ?!

617
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,919
I Iive for the penciI
and to draw pictures.

618
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,599
Graffiti is a piece of my Iife
and the way I express myseIf.

619
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:22,795
There's a smooth transition
from graffiti into other forms ofart.

620
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:29,242
Now I'm abIe to make
a Iiving with graffiti art.

621
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,959
But it aII started on trains.

622
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,119
This is my first whoIe-car.

623
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:42,439
We did this
about 20 years ago.

624
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,679
The ''inter-fame-express''

625
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:49,119
After that the first one-man
whoIe-cars, with KAGE,

626
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,879
caIIed ''stop toys on trains''.

627
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:57,438
Back then we did some
spectacuIar actions.

628
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:02,637
My passion started
with painting trains!

629
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,519
As soon as peopIe
start to reaIize

630
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,479
that we are reaIIy
passionate about graffiti,

631
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,679
that we create jobs for ourseIves

632
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,639
and back an entire industry

633
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,436
and don't want to
demoIish our environment.

634
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:26,716
They think about it
and then start to understand.

635
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:31,559
Outsiders usuaIIy can't understand
why we do what we do.

636
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,759
We don't get any money,

637
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,599
we're onIy investing money
and the poIice is chasing us.

638
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,999
In the end it is onIy
the Iove to the art

639
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,807
and that's it.

640
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,439
I aIways used too take my camera
with me to take pictures.

641
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,319
I'd never go painting without.

642
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,599
It's that simpIe.

643
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,158
There wouId be no sense in going
without taking pictures.

644
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,159
Otherwise it wouId be
Iike wasting the paint.

645
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,206
Ofcourse you have to take pictures.
That's very important.

646
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,399
EspeciaIIy when
it comes to trains

647
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,959
taking pictures
is very important.

648
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,919
You have to be abIe to
keep the vaIue ofthe work

649
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,762
after it has been cIeaned
some days Iater.

650
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,199
This is what you paint for.

651
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:57,356
You want to have a picture
ofyour art next to your bed.

652
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,079
EspeciaIIy because
the pieces don't Iast Iong.

653
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:08,239
I keep records of my paintings.
It's Iike a diary.

654
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,199
Every time I Iook at my pictures
I remember how I feIt

655
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,917
and that means a Iot to me.

656
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:23,520
It's my personaI diary without words
onIy made up of pictures.

657
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,079
It triggers memories
from the same day,

658
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:32,439
where I got the cans from.

659
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,399
Ifthe coIours Iook Iike
from a do-it-yourseIfstore

660
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,799
I remember where I stoIe them
and that's aIways funny.

661
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,559
I usuaIIy incIude pictures of my
crew in my bIack book.

662
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,519
The peopIe who were present
the day I did the piece.

663
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,407
Those are nice memories.

664
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,839
I'm not a graffiti artist myseIf,

665
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:59,599
but I've been taking pictures of
graffiti in BerIin for many years now.

666
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,959
and over the years

667
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:08,279
I've estabIished an archive
of over 70.000 pictures.

668
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:15,918
I take pictures of bombings,
trains, haII offame, of everything.

669
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,916
What makes my coIIection unique
is that I've created a system

670
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:31,637
so that I can
Iocate every picture.

671
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,719
I think it wouId be a pity

672
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:42,039
ifaII those precious pieces
from the past wouId be Iost.

673
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,919
For exampIe ''AMOK-Pieces''
in the BundespIatz haII of fame,

674
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:48,039
a train by SHEKwith a
pumpkin inside...

675
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,039
a PARTtrain made by SARE
in Schïneweide...

676
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,959
with aII these new coIours.

677
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:58,719
And aII the other miIestones
in BerIin graffiti cuIture.

678
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,198
Without them the spirit
wouId be gone too.

679
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:08,319
I keep records because
it's important for me to remember.

680
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,999
And one day I wouId Iike
to show my chiIdren

681
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,126
what their daddy
has done in his past.

682
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:22,199
I onIy take pictures of my trains if
I think that it's a nice piece.

683
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,959
Sometimes after I've painted
a piece I go back home

684
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,199
and I prefer to have a nap instead
of chasing the train for a picture.

685
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,959
It aII depends.

686
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,319
It's a pity ifyou put
so much effort into it

687
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,839
and you end up with an
ugIy picture taken at night.

688
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,319
Here the trains usuaIIy
are on track at Ieast once,

689
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,559
before they're cIeaned.

690
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:47,999
So there's aIways the chance
ofgetting a good picture.

691
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,679
That's top notch!

692
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,959
A Iot ofwriters don't care,
they just go home

693
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,479
and trust their friends
to take the pictures.

694
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,958
That's nice as weII, but you shouId
put some effort into it for yourseIf.

695
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,159
In the beginning we took
bad pictures from bad angIes.

696
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,999
Nowadays we prefer
to take pictures at a certain spot

697
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,409
or with a certain background.

698
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:10,919
The Iight is important.
How does it hit the train?

699
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,125
What type ofa camera is used ?

700
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,849
And the Iocation is important.

701
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,798
We aIways try to get
a variety ofdifferent pictures.

702
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,839
It's Iike trophy hunting.

703
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,799
You aIways want another.

704
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,679
You aIways want to put
your Iatest ideas into action,

705
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,119
and take one more picture.

706
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,723
Just Iike hunting for
the best trophy possibIe.

707
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:44,517
They take pictures
oftheir crimes.

708
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:51,323
and pubIish them
in magazines or the internet.

709
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:57,599
Magazines have became
more and more important.

710
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:03,039
Lots ofartists send
pictures to these magazines.

711
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,677
Everyone wants to have
their piece in there.

712
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:11,039
Magazines and videos are
very important to me.

713
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,439
I have done a Iot oftrains
that didn't go on track.

714
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:20,043
Magazines and videos heIp
to present your stuff.

715
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,119
OnIy because your piece
is in a magazine

716
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,239
doesn't mean
that you're good.

717
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:30,239
Magazines are there
for pubIic reIations.

718
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,877
To show the worId
what you've achieved.

719
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:40,116
It's not reaIIy
that important to us writers.

720
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,759
I was never
reaIIy interested in magazines.

721
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,599
They are a nice.

722
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:59,199
I prefer to see trains
puII up into the station.

723
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:03,359
There were a Iot of peopIe
that were sending out pictures.

724
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,119
But I was never interested
in that kind ofthing.

725
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,768
I onIy do graffiti for myseIf,
and those that enjoy my work.

726
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:37,041
One day the industry
discovered us.

727
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:43,039
In the mid 90's
suddenIy there were cans

728
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:48,678
specificIy designed
for graffiti artists.

729
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:56,277
WeII, we used to do
graffiti ourseIves.

730
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:02,397
We're part ofthe scene and we
coIIaborate with the artists as weII.

731
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:08,642
We sponsor artists
and sometimes we invite them

732
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,639
to test our products
and get direct feedback.

733
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,447
We work cIoseIy together.

734
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,319
Nowadays cans
are so much better.

735
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:22,366
I can't describe
how much they've improved.

736
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,720
The cans oftoday
are a dream come true.

737
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,047
These cans reaIIy
are a Iot offun.

738
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:33,759
The coIours don't drip
and cover perfectIy.

739
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,079
You can paint
much better pieces..

740
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,879
The resuIt is that

741
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,359
the demand has increased
and the market has grown.

742
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,879
I can't give you
any exact numbers.,

743
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,319
But BerIin certainIy
is one of our top markets.

744
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,599
We seII a Iot ofcans
in Paris as weII.

745
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,639
The big cities in generaI.

746
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:58,403
But BerIin and Paris are
our biggest markets worIdwide.

747
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:02,199
You can see that there is
an ongoing coIIaboration

748
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:05,042
between writers and the industry.

749
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:11,721
There are cans avaiIabIe with
pictures of raiI tracks and trains.

750
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:19,756
Ofcourse we deveIop cans
that enabIe peopIe to work fast.

751
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:24,917
A Iot ofthe writers are used to
working fast, even at IegaI spots.

752
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:30,237
Thus our cans are aIso
very usefuI for iIIegaI graffiti.

753
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:39,723
But we don't deveIop cans
specificaIy for painting trains.

754
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:01,799
Nowadays there are so many
different types ofcans

755
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,639
and you can buy them
in Aggro BerIin bags.

756
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,799
You can bring graffiti and hip hop
into your Iiving room.

757
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,799
But you wouId appreciate
aII ofthis a Iot more

758
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,482
ifyou had to discover
it aII for yourseIf.

759
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:16,599
Back in the days
Graffiti was rare and precious.

760
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,999
You didn't know what was
out there and where to find it.

761
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,959
You had to expIore it for yourseIf.

762
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,399
Now you can see graffiti
aII over the pIace,

763
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,959
in every magazine,
in music videos... everywhere.

764
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,120
There wasn't such an overkiII
ofgraffiti when we started.

765
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:35,799
Nowadays you can
take 20 magazines

766
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:39,679
and you can pick out bits
here and there.

767
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,599
Two weeks Iater you'II be abIe
to draw a proper piece.

768
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:48,359
But there's no innovation.
There's too few outstanding writers

769
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,202
and creative minds Ieft out there.

770
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,639
Nowadays graffiti has become
as popuIar as drinking in the park

771
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,759
or pIaying footbaII.

772
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,519
ApproximateIy every
third kid gives it a go..

773
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:08,237
The question is
how serious they're about it.

774
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,119
You have to be skiIIed
with pen and paper

775
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:16,079
or even be abIe to puII
something offwith just one coIour,

776
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,199
with a unique styIe.

777
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,079
That's what makes
a true writer.

778
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,649
Buying 1000 cans
has nothing to do with it.

779
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,519
I onIy need a can and a cap,
nothing eIse.

780
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,123
No skinny caps or any other crap.

781
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:39,999
I feeI the desire to go out
again and again to do new stuff,

782
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,879
even if it starts to become a routine.
It's Iike having a reguIarjob.

783
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:48,079
I can't waste three weekends
in a row in front ofthe TV

784
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,119
and get high on drugs.

785
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:54,119
It's Iike an urge from within
that makes you do aII that.

786
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,120
It's Iike a reguIarjob.

787
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,879
I don't care if peopIe know me.

788
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:05,039
I want to Ieave something behind
that other peopIe appreciate.

789
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,643
It's beauty that I Ieave behind.

790
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:13,079
Graffiti offers me a Iot.

791
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:17,365
It's a Iot offun
and I can be very creative.

792
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,319
I aIways made sure
that peopIe couId see my name.

793
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,366
That's what motivated me.

794
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:27,999
In my eyes graffiti works best
by painting styIes.

795
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,478
Pictures fiIIed with action- baaam-
Iike the titIe ofa comic.

796
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:37,119
There's energy and action.

797
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:39,719
Paint how you want to paint

798
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:44,319
whiIe you can feeI the tension
ofthe cat-and-mouse game.

799
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:49,479
You transfer aII this tension
into the piece.

800
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,844
That's totaIIy nuts.

801
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,159
You've achieved
something near impossibIe

802
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,047
that a reguIar person
can't even understand

803
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,599
You are trespassing a yard
and paint for 40 minutes.

804
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,999
Later your name is on track
for over a week for free.

805
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,841
That's awesome!

806
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:31,720
To be in a tube tunneI painting
a train is an incredibIe feeIing.

807
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:37,839
It feeIs Iike freedom, totaI freedom.

808
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:42,875
There are no boundaries.
You do whatever you want to do.

809
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,119
You just do your thing,
nothing eIse.

810
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:59,120
You don't have to fiII out an
appIication form or anything.

811
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,406
You just go for it.

812
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:06,759
There's the adrenaIine
and action kick you get...

813
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:11,439
...with the high voItage power Iines
and the cat-and-mouse-game

814
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,559
But aII that is onIy a surpIus.

815
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:20,399
The main thing is to see
your train on the raiI tracks,

816
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,446
at a tube station or in the yard.

817
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:28,961
That'sjust fascinating.

818
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,119
UsuaIIy when you see your train
approaching the station

819
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:40,719
You're exhausted and
sweaty from the action.

820
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,279
You've been in a hurry,

821
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,559
but it's aII worth it.

822
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:49,079
You're overwheImed
with goose bumps.

823
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,919
It's Iike in paradise
with a drink in your Ieft

824
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,119
and a joint
in your right hand.

825
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,599
That's the best thing.

826
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,479
It's top notch.

827
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,999
Seeing your train and even
being abIe to ride it yourseIf

828
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,285
is simpIy the best
thing in the worId.

829
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:13,127
I'm sitting inside!

830
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,527
Dude I'm sitting inside!

831
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,769
I'm inside...

832
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,443
...I can't beIieve it!

833
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,206
See ya.

834
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,519
Yeah, you know that you've
been there, that's your moment.

835
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:34,039
The night that you sacrificed
was your night.

836
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:37,679
No matter who knocks on
your door the next day.

837
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,567
That day was yours.

838
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,727
OnIy yours!

839
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:47,961
EspeciaIIy ifyou have a picture
to document it.

840
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,679
Speaking of BerIin
you have to note

841
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,599
that it's mainIy
german teenagers.

842
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:01,039
There are onIy very few kids

843
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:04,839
from famiIies with a foreign
background or even girIs.

844
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:08,039
BasicaIIy it's maIe
german teenagers seeking...

845
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,643
...fame and recognition.

846
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:16,239
They start offwith nothing

847
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,888
to buiId up a reputation.

848
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,724
Some wiII succeed others faiI.

849
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:27,439
I beIieve that fame is key.
It's aII about fame.

850
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:31,439
You want to attract attention.

851
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:36,559
Writing and bombing is
aII about fame, nothing eIse.

852
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:40,959
It's about being there
and being noticed.

853
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,359
Take me the way I am,
because I'm a part ofyou

854
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:48,199
even if I'm different,
just notice me.

855
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,598
This is why fame is the basis.

856
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:55,079
Graffiti aIways has a Iot
to do with attention.

857
01:07:55,080 --> 01:08:00,279
PeopIe are bored and have
to do something, have to go out,

858
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:03,838
to present themseIves.
Graffiti is the simpIest way to go.

859
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,399
When I was much younger
and started doing graffiti

860
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,839
fame was very important
but unachievabIe.

861
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:13,727
I thought it wouId be cooI to have
my name tagged aII over the pIace.

862
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:17,479
WeII, it takes years to acquire fame.
You can't force it.

863
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,279
It comes by itseIf.

864
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:22,959
You start to buiId up your network
and one thing Ieads to another.

865
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:27,999
Nowadays I prefer to change
my name rather than be famous.

866
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,081
I've got the fame but what
good is it ? I can't spend it.

867
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:38,642
Stefan knew that he had
estabIished a name over the years.

868
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:42,759
The probIem was that
onIy insiders knew about him,

869
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:45,919
reguIar peopIe didn't
have a cIue who he was.

870
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,762
This type offame doesn't mean
anything in the outside worId.

871
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:55,556
IIIegaI graffiti is ''bad''.
LegaI graffiti is ''good''.

872
01:08:56,160 --> 01:09:00,479
However, that concept
doesn't work for me.

873
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:04,559
ParadoxicaIIy, sometimes
the pieces I paint iIIegaIIy

874
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,759
are much better
than the IegaI ones.

875
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:13,999
AIthough the iIIegaI one
is made under pressure

876
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,159
with the thriII ofgetting caught...

877
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,240
There's a difference...

878
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,918
...reIaxed...

879
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,758
...under pressure

880
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:38,439
But shouId I present my
iIIegaI graffitis to the pubIic?

881
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,679
I might faII into a trap.

882
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,759
You have to hide
your stuffaway aII the time.

883
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:49,841
Because you never know when
the poIice might knock on your door.

884
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,759
I aIways have to keep
my stuff hidden away.

885
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:58,719
I can't just hang my pictures up
at home to enjoy them.

886
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:01,119
But that's ok.

887
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:06,917
I do it onIy for myseIf
and not anyone eIse.

888
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:19,041
It's a weird feeIing now that I don't
store my books at home anymore.

889
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:26,039
Now that I don't see them anymore
I tend to forget about them.

890
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:30,204
I Ioose track ofthem.

891
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:36,439
After severaI years
they deveIop a signature styIe.

892
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:40,719
Ifwe're abIe to
Iink everything to one person

893
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:44,079
then one day we'II be abIe
to settIe some oId scores.

894
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,439
This isn't possibIe in aII cases,
but we want to trace aII crimes

895
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:54,476
and make those peopIe responsibIe
for the damage they have done.

896
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:58,679
AII the pressure from
the poIice investigations

897
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:02,079
makes you hide your pictures

898
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:06,797
and one day
you can't find them anymore.

899
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,237
You have to be abIe
to handIe your fear

900
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:15,244
and deaI with paranoia.

901
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,477
It's what you need to expect
ifyou engage in iIIegaI activities.

902
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,759
I beIieve the biggest disadvantage
of being a writer is

903
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,039
that you're constantIy tired.
You couId aIways take a nap.

904
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,839
But there's aIways something
you have to do.

905
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,639
In my spare time I tend
to check out new spots,

906
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,639
take pictures,
buy cans... whatever.

907
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,599
It's a fuII time job

908
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,362
and to manage your daiIy
Iife is quite chaIIenging.

909
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,879
You have to sync your Iife to
the pubIic transport scheduIes.

910
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,399
Ifyou want to paint trains

911
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:52,605
you mostIy
have to do it at night.

912
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,119
Graffiti dominates your Iife.

913
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:58,041
You have to make
a Iot ofcompromises.

914
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,719
You have a different daiIy routine
than a reguIar person.

915
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:02,759
You go to work
with tired eyes.

916
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,559
PeopIe start asking
what you do in your spare time.

917
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:08,359
You buiId up
a second identity.

918
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:11,199
Without even noticing it.

919
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:15,519
You're unabIe to deaI
with the probIems of others.

920
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,885
You onIy spend your time
with other writers.

921
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,959
You Ioose touch to your own famiIy
and your environment,

922
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,767
yourjob
or the job center.

923
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:29,878
You definiteIy miss out
on a Iot of nice things.

924
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,559
You negIect reaIIy
important things.

925
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:37,119
And one day
you'II wake up from your dream

926
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,882
and reaIize
that you have nothing.

927
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:44,919
Ifyou paint
without a breathing mask

928
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:49,679
you certainIy damage your
heaIth by inhaIing aII the gases

929
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:53,204
and the Iead
from the spray cans.

930
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,202
You spend a Iot of money.

931
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:59,399
You get invoIved
in the whoIe graffiti thing

932
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,799
and therefore iIIegaI activities
that you may not reaIIy want.

933
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,599
The troubIe
with the poIice is huge.

934
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:10,319
They've searched
my home more than once.

935
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,798
I've been taken
to court severaI times as weII.

936
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:18,799
When I was very young
I was reaIIy impressed

937
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,919
when the poIice kicked in the door
just because of my brother.

938
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,719
I thought:
''Wow, what's he up to?''

939
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:28,319
Of course my mother
was very worried.

940
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:35,038
She aIways tried to support him
and keep him out oftroubIe.

941
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:40,199
Once she was at the GIB station
and an officer asked her

942
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:45,883
whether she actuaIIy knew
what he was doing aII night Iong.

943
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:51,919
She repIied that he's one ofthe
best writers in BerIin and Europe

944
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:55,565
and that he goes out at night
to create art.

945
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,721
The officer did not know
what to repIy.

946
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,159
The pressure from the poIice is

947
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:09,047
immense and
difficuIt to handIe.

948
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:12,607
They gave me
a very hard time too.

949
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:18,479
Once the poIice was constantIy
observing us for 2 weeks.

950
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:21,319
They wanted
to study our patterns.

951
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:24,684
But at the end ofthe day
they couIdn't stop us anyway.

952
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,759
You can't get rid
ofthis kind of pressure

953
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,839
as Iong as you're
invoIved in iIIegaI graffiti.

954
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,919
There are so many
investigative units

955
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,080
that are putting on
a tremendous pressure.

956
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,119
Ifyou're in
your mid twenties

957
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:58,280
and teII peopIe that
you're invoIved in graffiti

958
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,839
they think that it's
very chiIdish behaviour.

959
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,159
They don't understand.

960
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:07,877
They've never shown
any reaI interest in it,

961
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,199
and don't understand
what it means to you.

962
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:19,279
WhiIe the other chiIdren
were pIaying footbaII

963
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:23,759
he was sitting
in front of his bIack book.

964
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,318
I considered it a game or a hobby
but it became his Iife.

965
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:32,079
Graffiti has been
a huge part of my Iife.

966
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:36,079
It's been my daiIy bread
for 21 years

967
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,879
I haven't even had
a girIfriend in 21 years

968
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:43,039
Graffiti is the most
important thing in my Iife.

969
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:47,959
I've visited a Iot of different
countries and cities

970
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,399
I wouIdn't have visited
them otherwise.

971
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,128
Graffiti has Ieft
a mark on my Iife.

972
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:58,799
To me it's one thing onIy:
True passion.

973
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,164
And that's
what my Iife is about.

974
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,439
I'm a very passionate person
and it keeps me aIive.

975
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:07,199
That's the essence
that I put into my styIes.

976
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,439
That's very important to me.

977
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,600
No passion - no styIe. No passion -
no Iife. No passion - no fun.

978
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,039
It has become
a way of Iife.

979
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:18,399
I've given up
a Iot for graffiti.

980
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,560
I gave up
on schooI for it.

981
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,319
It was aII a bit too much.

982
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:31,117
Ifyou painted a train at 6 a.m.
you wouIdn't go to schooI at 8 a.m.

983
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,479
The onIy thing
you care about is graffiti.

984
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:38,481
I've invested
bIood, sweat and tears.

985
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,278
I Iive and die for it.

986
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:00,524
Graffiti is my thirst for Iife.

987
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:05,999
I feeI aIive when I'm out there
at night, high on adrenaIine.

988
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,319
There's onIy the train,
your buddies and you.

989
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,639
Writing our names on the train.
That'sjust awesome.

990
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:18,039
It's pure Iife,
Iike a second Iife.

991
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:21,119
Ifyou're abIe
to hoId a reguIarjob as weII

992
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,799
and keep it hidden
from your coIIeagues

993
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:28,639
it's quite
a speciaI feeIing.

994
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,999
Not because you feeI
Iike someone speciaI

995
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,759
but it provides
a baIance to the reguIar routine.

996
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:39,239
At midnight I turn the tabIes
and do my thing.

997
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:42,798
That's the Iust for Iife.

998
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,959
Trainwriting to me is...

999
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:48,399
...passion, Iove, action...

1000
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,207
...friendship, thriII...

1001
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,127
...pIaying games with the poIice.

1002
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,199
It's awesome!

1003
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:02,439
And when you grow oIder
and can't carry on doing it

1004
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:09,158
it'II be hard to find something
as fuIIfiIIing as this.

1005
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:13,559
CurrentIy it's more important
to me than any woman orjob.

1006
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:15,799
I reaIIy negIect everything.

1007
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:20,679
I beIieve it's a second Iife...

1008
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:23,362
...and it'II never find an end.

1009
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:30,557
My non-graffiti friends and
my famiIy are not very pIeased

1010
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:36,404
about my devotion to graffiti.

1011
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,559
AIthough they don't have a cIue

1012
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,765
how much time I reaIIy invest.

1013
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:47,159
My friends and famiIy
toIerate and accept it.

1014
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:50,119
They acknowIedge
how much time I invest.

1015
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:52,689
Through graffiti I've met
a Iot ofgreat peaopIe.

1016
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:59,159
In my environment
everyone was into graffiti aIready.

1017
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:02,239
Either we were
partners or rivaIs.

1018
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:09,240
I'd teII my mum that
I was going out to paint a train.

1019
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:15,679
She'd repIy:
Be carefuI, I'm not paying for it!

1020
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:23,844
You notice it because of
the rackIing ofthe cans

1021
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:28,521
and you couId teII
by his behaviour.

1022
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:33,399
He'd onIy come home for dinner
and to sIeep. That's aII.

1023
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:38,606
I aIways knew what it meant
when he Ieft the house with cans.

1024
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,718
I'd teII him to be carefuI
and not to get caught.

1025
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:46,439
I've aIways tried to keep
graffiti away from my famiIy.

1026
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:49,839
But after a whiIe
it's impossibIe.

1027
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,519
For sure we've had
a Iot oftroubIe at home

1028
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,918
but that's part ofthe game.

1029
01:20:55,080 --> 01:21:00,279
There's not a thing in this worId
that wouId make me quit.

1030
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,087
It's just impossibIe.

1031
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,203
I think one day
Stefan got Iost in it.

1032
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:19,041
He decided that this is his Iife
and it'II stay Iike this forever,

1033
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:27,958
and that he didn't want
to estabIish anything eIse.

1034
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:36,919
So he got Iost in the Ietters,
the smeII and the coIours

1035
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:41,398
and the whoIe IifestyIe.

1036
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,524
I don't beIieve
that he got Iost in the art.

1037
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:52,557
He Iost track of himseIf,

1038
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:58,243
he disappeared from his Iife
and Iived more and more for graffiti.

1039
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:04,641
He became RUÆD
and Stefan was gone.

1040
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:11,641
Me and others
wanted Stefan...

1041
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:28,040
Maybe he forgot
who Stefan reaIIy was...

1042
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,439
...and onIy knew
how to be RUÆD.

1043
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:34,645
But RUÆD aIone
didn't keep him aIive.

1044
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:40,839
Stefan commited suicide
on 29th august 2002

1045
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:43,761
by jumping
in front ofa train.

1046
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:47,999
Between
Priesterweg and Papestrasse.

1047
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,763
It was right near
the haII offame.

1048
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,839
Graffiti was
at the top of his Iist.

1049
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:00,599
My mother wasn't
even cIose to it, me neither,

1050
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,319
no girIfriends...

1051
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,968
nobody, not even god.

1052
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:09,157
He mentioned god
in his fareweII Ietter:

1053
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:15,884
''My mistake was that I didn't
beIieve in god, onIy in graffiti.!

1054
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:24,039
A Iife without graffiti is possibIe.
Sooner or Iater you have to accept it.

1055
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:29,759
You just can't paint trains
aII the time at the age of40.

1056
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,238
That's something
to be aware of.

1057
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:37,117
I've never stopped painting.

1058
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:42,157
I've never
had a break from it.

1059
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:50,120
I don't know how Iife wouId be
without, not even for one year.

1060
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:57,835
I'm sure I wouId
see things very different.

1061
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:01,359
I don't want to stop.

1062
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:05,039
But I think that
one day the time wiII come...

1063
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,564
...when things are constant
and Iife is more serious.

1064
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:14,797
And the remaining nighttime
adventures are more treasured.

1065
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,768
They're very speciaI.

1066
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,479
Too many things
have happened.

1067
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,844
They're Iess easygoing
and think twice.

1068
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:41,519
Now I keep caIm because he
doesn't want to paint trains anymore.

1069
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:45,203
It's become way to dangerous.

1070
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:58,359
I'd stiII Iove to go out
every day and paint trains.

1071
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:01,559
However, at a certain age
the punishment

1072
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,367
and the consequences
are much harder.

1073
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:08,402
If it works out that's cooI.
But I don't go and chase it anymore.

1074
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:12,165
The hunger is stiII there.
It's a certain feeIing.

1075
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:16,919
I don't beIieve that I can
satisfy my hunger for trains.

1076
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:21,479
I aIways come up
with new sketches

1077
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:25,039
and picture them
on trains.

1078
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:30,280
Or I want to do
a whoIe car, or whatever.

1079
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:35,006
The hunger is here to stay.

1080
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:40,076
Even iftrains wouId fIy
we'II stiII paint them.

1081
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:44,919
There is no way to separate
a serious writer from a train.

1082
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:46,602
AbsoIuteIy no way!

1083
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:50,639
The hunger to paint trains
has aIways been there,

1084
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:53,799
since I painted
the first Iines on a train.

1085
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:57,239
I knew that I'd found
what I reaIIy was Iooking for.

1086
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,599
And it never stopped.

1087
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:04,522
I'II do the Iast Iines when
there are no more cans Ieft.

1088
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:20,959
You can go ''aII in'' on trains

1089
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,879
and set free
aII ofyour creativity.

1090
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,919
But you can't expect
to receive anything in return,

1091
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:34,364
or Iive a reguIar Iife
with a secure income...

1092
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:41,719
...a nice flat, a beautifuI wife
and chiIdren or whatever.

1093
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:47,119
It doesn't go hand in hand
with this aggressive IifestyIe.

1094
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,199
No way!

1095
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:52,678
And ifyou go for it,
go the whoIe way.

1096
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,559
But be aware of
what you are doing.

1097
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:58,719
And how it effects
the peopIe around you...

1098
01:26:58,720 --> 01:27:00,561
...your famiIy...

1099
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,880
...and yourseIf!

1100
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,119
What makes you happy?

1101
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:15,719
Writing trains.

1102
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:19,359
The feeIing
when you've hit a train.

1103
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,963
Seeing your train on tracks.

1104
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,444
But ask yourseIfwhether
this feeIing is permanent happiness.

1105
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,881
Or is happiness...

1106
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:39,041
...being abIe to teII the story...

1107
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:42,479
Back in the days, in BerIin,

1108
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,799
I used to paint trains
that went aII around the city.

1109
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,403
It was a good time.

1110
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,806
Good times.

1111
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,639
Not more...

1112
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:54,845
...and not Iess!
