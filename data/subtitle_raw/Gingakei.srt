<b>GALAXY</b>

2
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,500
<i>It's the engine.</i>

3
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,500
<i>The brake?</i>

4
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,500
<i>Be careful.</i>

5
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,600
<i>I think it's the plug.</i>

6
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,690
<i>- Plug.
- Must be the plug.</i>

7
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,000
<i>The plug is dirty. It's wet.</i>

8
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,600
<i>- Not the plug. The cam.
- Plug. Pla... Prav...</i>

9
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,720
<i>- Pravda.
- Pravda?</i>

10
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,510
<i>No. It's Pravda.</i>

11
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,960
<i>Pravda. Pravda.</i>

12
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,430
<i>Pravda.
This can't move anymore?</i>

13
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,910
<i>- Pravda?
- Yes! Soviet.</i>

14
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,360
<i>Must be the plug!</i>

15
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,380
<i>He's a correspondent for Pravda.</i>

16
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,410
<i>Pravda.</i>

17
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,510
It wasn't me.

18
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,510
I didn't do it!

19
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,010
The plug was really dirty!

20
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,720
I didn't mean any harm!

21
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,220
If there's a chance,
I'll pay you back.

22
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,520
But you...

23
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,550
You don't want
to be involved with me.

24
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,270
I'm always watching you.

25
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,420
You ghost!

26
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,190
Please...

27
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,320
Please, don't delve any deeper.

28
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,470
Who... who told you to do this?

29
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,450
Who told you to do this!

30
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,090
What do you know about me?

31
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,700
You're only doing...

32
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,160
what he expected you to do.

33
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,400
Are you...

34
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,100
Always playing such dirty tricks?

35
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,400
Stop...

36
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,100
Please...

37
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,650
Please...

38
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,700
Sorry.

39
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,620
That must hurt a lot.

40
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,790
If you get ahold of yourself,

41
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,630
We'll meet again
when you get back.

42
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,410
But...

43
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,920
We'll always pass each other by.

44
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,610
So I want to chase you.

45
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,310
Perhaps...

46
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,300
that wasn't you.

47
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,710
Right in front of you...

48
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,710
All the time for 20 years...

49
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,680
All the time...

50
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,480
Someone's walking before
you like a white shadow...

51
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,120
That's right.

52
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,320
It's the "you" from that time.

53
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,620
From that time.

54
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,680
Me... from "that time"?

55
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,720
Do you know me?

56
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,620
Back then,

57
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,510
Before you became yourself,

58
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:55,420
When you couldn't take a
step forward or backward...

59
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,470
I'm you from that time.

60
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,330
Excuse me...

61
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,760
A while ago, you...

62
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,730
Me?

63
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,100
No. Never mind.

64
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,930
What did I do?

65
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,530
Never mind.

66
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,070
<i>Beyond the bright sky,</i>

67
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,820
<i>From farther than
the rays of sun,</i>

68
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,040
<i>I came to be by your side.</i>

69
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,340
<i>At that time...</i>

70
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,730
<i>A long long time ago...</i>

71
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,860
<i>You left.</i>

72
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,100
<i>Separated from me.</i>

73
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,500
<i>Leaving me behind.</i>

74
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,500
<i>Sleepless nights...</i>

75
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,210
<i>Beyond the darkness.</i>

76
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,500
That was the first time?

77
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,490
Yes.

78
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,540
You're lying.
Aren't you here?

79
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,640
Unbelievable.

80
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,450
That it was decided so easily.

81
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,610
Unbelievable.

82
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:44,610
- Unbelievable.
- Wait. He's coming.

83
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,760
What should I do?

84
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,380
- Long time ago...
- You, you...

85
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,710
- The present "you" is no good.
- What should I do?

86
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,410
My "he" is coming.

87
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,670
My "he" is coming.

88
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,120
He is coming!

89
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,870
What should I do?

90
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,140
<i>Crickets chirping...</i>

91
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:25,130
<i>Iris leaves...</i>

92
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:33,530
<i>This darkness
and that darkness...</i>

93
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:39,540
<i>Taking photos of pines...</i>

94
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,220
<i>Pierced by the blade...</i>

95
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:56,060
<i>of the setting sun...</i>

96
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:03,700
<i>Why did you...</i>

97
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:10,420
<i>leave that kid?</i>

98
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,970
<i>Too late! Coward!</i>

99
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,690
<i>Even if you jump,</i>

100
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,060
<i>It makes no difference.</i>

101
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,010
Please understand.

102
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,650
I must go back to
the me of that time.

103
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,180
What time?

104
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,950
When?

105
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,530
For what?

106
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,430
When?

107
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,040
That time.

108
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,880
<i>Where?</i>

109
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,260
<i>Where are you?</i>

110
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,780
<i>Come out.</i>

111
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,820
<i>Come here.</i>

112
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,650
I want to meet
the me that I killed.

113
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,840
Meet him again!

114
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,780
Meet me!

115
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,440
Am I...

116
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,540
In a dream?

117
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,540
Or is it real?

118
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,220
What to do with her?

119
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,190
Do I know?

120
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,300
She's going to die.

121
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,020
You and she,

122
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,510
Stop saying bad things.
Go back!

123
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,030
Release me!

124
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:55,050
I came, because you wanted me to.

125
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,010
Bastard!

126
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,950
Oh, so you know me?

127
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,050
I can understand that.

128
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,720
Listen.
Be more specific.

129
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:26,360
You want to go against time?

130
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,030
Or go back to the past?

131
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,980
Or go into your dreams?

132
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,300
My...

133
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,070
He's really your incarnation.

134
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,500
But he's not the chap you think.

135
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,500
You think you can hide it
from me?

136
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,640
He's me.

137
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,700
Really?
Now he's really you.

138
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,400
He...

139
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,380
Wants to tell me
that he's my dream.

140
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,000
My world...

141
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,180
And all that cultivated me,

142
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,760
Belong to him.

143
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,510
Precisely.

144
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,910
Then what are you?

145
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,310
I am me!

146
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,830
And me?

147
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:58,010
You're just a fungus!

148
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,690
That lives in my toes
and give me athlete's foot!

149
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,510
You can only rise a bit
by the sun rays.

150
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,720
Do you know your car
fell off the highway?

151
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,410
Look at her!

152
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,230
She loves you from her heart.

153
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,860
You enjoy hurting yourself.
What's she gonna think?

154
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,220
What do you know?

155
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,000
I don't care.

156
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:36,210
I'm OK with the way I am now.

157
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,320
I'm going to...

158
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:46,520
Where he is!

159
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,430
But where?

160
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,940
It's not your fault.

161
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:05,090
But please leave me alone.

162
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,530
That's enough!

163
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,630
I'm going to you!

164
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,330
You're just dreaming...

165
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,440
You're just dreaming...

166
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,690
You're just walking around me.

167
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,850
It's the frame of your mind.
Don't you understand?

168
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,560
You are yourself.
Look within yourself.

169
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,730
You are yourself.
Look within yourself.

170
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,780
Don't look outside yourself!

171
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,350
You are yourself.
Look within yourself.

172
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,700
You're lost in the darkness
of yourself. Poor man!

173
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,530
"Don't look outside yourself?"

174
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:35,290
Only seeking yourself?

175
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,780
What is this?

176
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,540
That's why I don't trust you.

177
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:08,290
What a dirty trick!
That's not what I wanted.

178
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,500
You've always treated him badly.

179
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,900
You've no right to scold me.

180
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,810
If he's so dear to you,
why didn't you treat him well?

181
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,500
Why didn't I?

182
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,150
You've mixed up your nature
with your dream.

183
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:04,040
It's already too late
to cling to this man.

184
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,010
Shut up!

185
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,210
Hurry then.

186
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:29,280
You're not finished yet.

187
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:33,690
You can't give up
on yourself that easily.

188
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:37,050
You think you've realized
something important.

189
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,750
Soon you'll see
how scary you are!

190
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:48,410
Don't be stupid.
Go back at once.

191
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,630
After you die,
nothing would be started.

192
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,050
You want to do
something irreparable.

193
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,420
No, you've done nothing but
irreparable things.

194
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:16,500
You want to bury him.
You're really missing the point.

195
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,620
You're my dream.

196
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,860
You're my whole future.

197
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:23,240
I was wrong the whole time.

198
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:27,520
I pursue you to make
myself independent.

199
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,350
All right?
Shall we decide this here?

200
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,700
Bastard!

201
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,590
You want to die?

202
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:08,510
Or you don't?

203
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,660
You want to go to your next life?

204
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,890
Or go back to the past?

205
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:22,770
Can you have your own dream?

206
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:29,530
Let's go over everything.
And do what you like.

207
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:34,440
Your past is all karma.
All linked up in a string.

208
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,930
I'll show you!

209
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,530
<i>It's you from that time.</i>

210
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,130
<i>It's you from that time.</i>

211
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:00,430
Which do you choose?

212
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:25,780
<i>You're my dream.</i>

213
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:33,980
<i>My world... My dreams.</i>

214
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:08,350
<i>You are yourself.
Look within yourself.</i>

215
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:08,810
<i>Make myself independent...</i>

216
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,090
<i>Can you have your own dream?</i>

217
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,740
Goddamn monk!

218
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,340
Get off me!

219
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:06,540
Mirror...

220
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,040
Mirror!

221
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,540
Not here...

222
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,440
Where is it?

223
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,150
Mirror!

224
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:44,450
Please. Come here again.

225
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,960
I want to know
what you meant by...

226
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:53,950
"The thing in the distant past", and

227
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:58,260
"The thing that belongs to me".

228
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,400
I...

229
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:09,950
Don't mind dying.

230
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:31,500
I killed you.

231
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,890
Many times.

232
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:42,810
I don't know my world.
That's scary.

233
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,620
But I...

234
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:51,010
I'm not giving up.

235
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,710
It's boring to be alive.
Terribly boring.

236
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,550
But I have you.

237
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,080
I can meet you.

238
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,710
Somehow I'll go back to my wife.

239
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:21,900
Go back to the car that's
fallen off the highway, and live.

240
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:24,980
Do I really have to do that?

241
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,100
You're here!

242
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:17,940
The monk was right,

243
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,410
"You are yourself,"

244
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:23,970
"Don't look outside yourself."

245
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:28,230
You're wrong.
I don't know anything.

246
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:32,870
That's just his talk.

247
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:35,120
But...

248
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:37,610
You're me!

249
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:41,870
Your existence...
that's my dream, right?

250
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,100
Really.

251
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,150
It really is!

252
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,590
Before he died the monk said,

253
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:06,530
"That guy, he doesn't
have his own dream.

254
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,230
"That's why he's very frustrated."

255
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,690
Frustrated?

256
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:16,450
You're frustrated that
you don't have your dream.

257
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:18,230
You must be joking!

258
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,330
I have a lot of dreams!

259
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,430
Hey.

260
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:38,580
The monk isn't dead.

261
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,830
Because you've been lying,

262
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:50,900
He put on an act
to stop your lying.

263
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,840
And he's my dad.

264
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,440
My dad.

265
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:03,440
My dad.

266
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:05,760
Your dad.

267
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:10,540
I'll be frank.

268
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,570
I appear before you to make
you tidy up your memory.

269
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:21,570
Dad wants to know if
you're living in your dreams.

270
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,620
Because you're so unconcerned
about your memory.

271
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:47,890
Don't be so sad.

272
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:51,180
I like you.

273
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:55,710
You have such a tough life.

274
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:13,710
Your dream is still
a blank page.

275
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:17,000
Nothing was written on it.

276
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:21,550
That's why I'm so free.

277
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:41,680
Dad went back to the Underworld.

278
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:59,230
He said you can find
your memory in your dreams.

279
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:05,040
But... can you?

280
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,680
You can't, right?

281
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:21,650
That's the person you are.

282
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:53,930
That's the person I am.

283
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:44,460
<i>Must be the plug!
It's dirty!</i>

284
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:55,330
<i>Plug! Pravda!
Pravda? Pravda!</i>

285
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:22,060
THE END
