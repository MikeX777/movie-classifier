00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,010
Hello baby.

29
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,445
- What did you have in mind?

30
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,414
- I am new in town.

31
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,517
I come to America, the land
of opportunity, to make

32
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:08,054
a Hollywood movie and to
meet the blonde bombshell.

33
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,622
- You just met her, honey.

34
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,591
- Oh thank you very much.

35
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:16,262
Friends say to me, come
to Hollywood Boulevard.

36
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,998
- Well you came to
the right place.

37
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,534
You're not with the
police, are you?

38
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:25,171
- Police come to
Hollywood Boulevard too?

39
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,876
Everybody have fun in America.

40
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,844
- Yeah we'll have lots of fun.

41
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,646
What's your name, fella?

42
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:37,150
- They call me Long Wang.

43
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,418
- I'll bet they do.

44
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,187
- It's my Hollywood stage name.

45
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:42,922
(giggling)

46
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:46,092
So what are we going to do?

47
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,094
- Drive.

48
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,031
(intense music)

49
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,971
- What the hell are you doing?

50
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,872
Jesus Christ.

51
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,284
Get the fuck out of the way!

52
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,518
Come on!

53
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,455
(car horn honking)

54
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,491
Come on!

55
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,563
(loud crashing)

56
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:28,468
Six Victor 90, my
partner's in trouble.

57
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:33,406
- Please, nothing
crazy, I want to live.

58
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,408
You can have all of my money.

59
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,576
- You bet your ass I can.

60
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,578
Now drive you
fucking slope head,

61
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:41,080
to someplace nice and quiet.

62
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,382
- Slope head?

63
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,216
- Drive!

64
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:50,256
- I got a black and white
code three, I'm in pursuit.

65
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:54,193
(tires screeching)

66
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,896
- Faster, make this Jap
trap move, you guys made it.

67
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:57,730
- But I'm Chinese.

68
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,831
- Same shit.

69
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,233
Move!

70
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,338
(tires screeching)

71
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,878
(car horn honking)

72
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,446
God dammit, you're a cop.

73
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,347
- I no cop.

74
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:15,281
- Bullshit!

75
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,255
- Alright, I'm a cop.

76
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,962
(tires screeching)

77
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,544
(grunting)

78
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,851
(tires screeching)

79
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,836
(squealing)

80
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,615
He's a drag queen and
he tried to 211 me.

81
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:23,983
- You go down the
hill, I'll go around.

82
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:24,817
- Alright.

83
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,288
(intense music)

84
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,395
Ah shit!

85
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,164
(loud splashing)

86
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,022
Hey so you gonna
help me, or what?

87
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,524
- I can't swim.

88
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,728
- What do you mean
you can't swim?

89
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,962
- I can't swim.

90
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,467
- You never told me that.

91
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,002
- You never asked.

92
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,908
That's enough Ray,
we want this asshole

93
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:24,076
in the courthouse not
the coroner's office.

94
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,955
- You know what that
fruitcake called me?

95
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,157
A fucking slop head.

96
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,692
- Well?

97
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:42,595
- My parents were born in
Italy, I was raised in an

98
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:46,966
Italian ghetto, and I happen
to make a kick ass cannelloni.

99
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,534
- [Stevens] Yeah right.

100
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,870
And I thought this guy
had an identity problem.

101
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,926
- Rough night, sweetie?

102
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,232
- Oh aren't we testy tonight.

103
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,502
I bet you're a fucking Leo.

104
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,973
(speaking in foreign language)

105
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,609
Chili con carne to you too.

106
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,383
- I gotta tell you something,
you're beautiful, never shave.

107
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:43,523
I think he likes you.

108
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,535
(phone buzzing)

109
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,204
- Yeah.

110
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,239
Who?

111
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,542
Send her in.

112
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,150
Mrs. Stanton,
please have a seat.

113
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,457
Didn't you get my letter?

114
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:19,859
- Oh yes, I did.

115
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,595
- I'm afraid you've
made a mistake.

116
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,632
The wait out here could be
very long and painful for you.

117
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,835
- Do you think it would be
any less painful in Ohio?

118
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,506
- Do you have any concept
about what goes on out there?

119
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,840
Any idea at all?

120
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,376
- Look Captain Jensen,

121
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:40,446
this is not the only
place where life is hard.

122
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,683
I had Lori when I
was 17 years old.

123
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,918
Her father's never
even seen her.

124
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,553
I quit school to raise her

125
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:50,156
and I haven't stopped
working since.

126
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,758
I'm familiar with a hard life.

127
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,961
- But that's the
Midwest, Mrs. Stanton.

128
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,763
Let me give you a crash
course about Hollywood.

129
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,498
Each year thousands
of youngsters

130
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:02,134
come out here reaching
for their dreams.

131
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,571
They're out there
now on the streets

132
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:08,074
wondering where their
next meal will come from.

133
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:11,444
Most of them will be victims
of one kind or another.

134
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,479
Too many will wind up in jail,

135
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,082
county general, or the morgue.

136
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,985
Now please understand
the last thing I need is

137
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,854
another well meaning mother
wandering the sewers.

138
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,525
- She's my daughter,
my only child.

139
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,599
- Does she drink, do drugs?

140
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,536
- She drinks, I
guess most kids do.

141
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,939
She doesn't do drugs,
nothing like that.

142
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:45,144
- [Jensen] Does she
know anybody in LA?

143
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,380
- Right before I left town
one of her girlfriend's

144
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,849
gave me this letter from her.

145
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:53,519
Man named Walsh wanted to help
her get into show business.

146
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:55,788
- Walsh?

147
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:58,991
- James Walsh.

148
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,529
- What else can you tell
me about your daughter?

149
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:08,834
- She's um, just a little girl.

150
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,703
She has a lot of
growing up to do.

151
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:16,042
Actually Lori is
a very quiet girl.

152
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,079
Not so much with her
friends, but with strangers.

153
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,515
I always had to watch over her.

154
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,917
I didn't smother her,

155
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,320
but I always tried
to take care of her.

156
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,058
She never had to work, she
doesn't know how to cook,

157
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:36,228
she wouldn't even know
how to make a living.

158
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:41,567
I can't imagine her in a
big city like Hollywood.

159
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,838
(ominous music)

160
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,574
- [Jensen] This is
Six Victor Commander,

161
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,309
I want Hawkins to
put a case together

162
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,379
on James Walsh and
Pretty Girl Escorts.

163
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,914
- [Police Radio Man] Roger 90.

164
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:05,091
- Mr. Walsh, your
phone messages.

165
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,625
- Thank you, Charlene.

166
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,895
- You have any messages
for me Charlie?

167
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,265
- The name is Charlene.

168
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,071
- How come you never
give me my messages?

169
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,708
- Because you're
such an asshole.

170
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,116
Go on in.

171
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,263
- Suppose you told
Mr. Walsh about

172
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,599
these nasty rumors I've
been hearing lately?

173
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,301
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

174
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,439
I haven't been holding out on
tips, Mr. Walsh, I promise.

175
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,412
- Bullshit.

176
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,682
What is it Lori, hmm?

177
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,085
You losing your
little girl charm?

178
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,155
Maybe just getting lazy?

179
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,023
- No I'm not.

180
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,992
I'll try harder, I will.

181
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,126
- You better.

182
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:19,131
'Cause that stuff
you like so much

183
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:30,609
that makes you feel
so good is expensive.

184
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,478
- I know it is.

185
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:33,946
- And another thing,

186
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,482
you don't carry this
stuff when you're working.

187
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:39,552
- That's right.

188
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,489
I can come up with the
bail for a whore bust,

189
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:47,860
but if they catch
you with that stuff

190
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,930
I might have to let you rot.

191
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,499
You understand, don't you?

192
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,569
You understand, don't you?

193
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:57,937
Say it!

194
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:59,438
- Yes I understand!

195
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:00,239
- Good.

196
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,974
Good.

197
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,179
So good.

198
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,888
You better get to work.

199
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:18,824
- Thank you, sir.

200
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:33,906
(upbeat music)

201
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,294
- [Man] Hey baby,
you a working girl?

202
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,496
- Pull into the lot so
we can talk about it.

203
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,577
Okay that's far enough
buddy, just stop right here.

204
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,921
Looking for something?

205
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:24,790
- A party.

206
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:26,392
Would you like to join?

207
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,294
- What kind of party?

208
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,564
- You, me, and Mike.

209
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,200
- You, me, and who?

210
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,904
- You, me, and Mike,
here in the car.

211
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,339
- Who's Mike?

212
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,276
- Who's Mike?

213
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,820
- Meet Mike, shake hands.

214
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:57,790
Get acquainted.

215
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:02,661
- I bet you have names for
every part of your body, huh?

216
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,097
- I thought I'd
heard everything.

217
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:08,367
- I call mine Roscoe, only
when we're on good terms.

218
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,503
- What do you call your ass?

219
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,772
(laughing)

220
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:17,042
- Rory, what do you call yours?

221
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,010
- Jaws.

222
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,146
(laughing loudly)

223
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,720
- Hey he likes you, I can tell.

224
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:32,558
Come on, go ahead, don't be shy.

225
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,859
- I'm a little shy.

226
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,795
- He's really very friendly.

227
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,063
He likes to play.

228
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,600
A secret.

229
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:47,072
Mike just loves getting
kissed behind his left ear.

230
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,675
You're getting real
excited, right?

231
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,043
- Does it show?

232
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,612
- The glazed eyes give you away.

233
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:56,782
Come on, well you can
look at it real close.

234
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,220
Alright, will you do it for $50?

235
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,788
- Okay bought and paid for.

236
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,392
(upbeat music)

237
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,760
- [Man] $55.

238
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,360
- [Betty] That's more like

239
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,295
a speed limit than
an actual offer.

240
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,964
- [Man] Hey it's a work of art?

241
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,600
You know some works of art
you can look at from far away.

242
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,201
But some, you have
to get real close.

243
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,337
- Hey, hey, police.

244
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,338
- Oh my god.

245
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,342
What's that doing down there?

246
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:25,878
- Ricky.

247
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,446
- [Ricky] Shut off
the fucking car.

248
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,884
Hey come on, shut off the car.

249
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,254
- You dented my dildo.

250
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,689
- This is not funny, will
you please stop the car?

251
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,892
- Now I'll have to buy the
kit a new paint patch set.

252
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,828
(tires screeching)

253
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:53,072
No way, no way, Grace
would kill me for this.

254
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,940
- You son of a bitch.

255
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,843
(tires screeching)

256
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:13,392
- Kill me, kill me.

257
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,593
If you don't, Grace will.

258
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,361
- I'm gonna take your
fucking suspenders

259
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,597
and wrap them around your neck.

260
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,568
Stop the car.

261
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,807
- [Man] You ruin my car service.

262
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:31,043
(loud crashing)

263
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,212
What'd I tell ya.

264
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,750
- Come on.

265
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,552
- I'm innocent.

266
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,254
Innocent as the day is long.

267
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,822
- Everything's okay.

268
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:44,723
(zipping loudly)

269
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:46,191
- Of course.

270
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,426
(screaming)

271
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,562
I wanna die, I wanna die!

272
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,097
- You're not gonna
die, you're not gonna

273
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,133
die in my custody,
too many reports.

274
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,135
- You are hurting my arm.

275
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,538
- Why did you move in
on my bust like that?

276
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,207
- You were as nervous
as a whore in church.

277
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,144
- You asshole, that was my
bust, I could've handled it.

278
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,112
- That's Mr. Asshole to you.

279
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,982
- Listen Rambo, I can do
anything that you can do.

280
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,150
- Oh yeah?

281
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,951
- I bet you can't grow a beard.

282
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,020
- I bet you can't
pee standing up.

283
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,756
- I bet you and
Mike could teach me.

284
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,633
(upbeat music)

285
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,644
(kids giggling)

286
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,312
- [Kid] I wanna see.

287
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,951
- Hey kids, what's going on?

288
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,789
(kids laughing)

289
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,768
- [Barry] Come on let's not be
afraid to hurt the kid here.

290
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,536
What do you think we're
making, Mary Poppins?

291
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,637
- [Woman] Jesus Christ Barry,

292
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,206
what do you expect he's only 16.

293
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,607
- I don't give a damn,
he's supposed to act.

294
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,608
No, no, no.

295
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,311
Come over here, stand
over there, not like that.

296
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,515
I need some pain here, pain.

297
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,749
That's what sells cassettes.

298
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,551
See this, like this, see this?

299
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,386
Moron, like that.

300
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:22,821
Alright here we go.

301
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,590
Tina, get in here, hurry it up.

302
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,759
You think any chance
I get this shot today?

303
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,696
- [Camera Man] Clear the
lens, I wanna get a vote.

304
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,732
- [Barry] Let's get
it right this time.

305
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,834
God dammit, I've
spent a lot of money.

306
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:36,602
- [Camera Man] Cameras rolling.

307
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,836
- Let's do a take.

308
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:40,005
- [Camera Man] Viking Love
Space scene A take two.

309
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,840
- [Barry] And action.

310
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,943
- Take this gift,
oh viking queen.

311
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,213
- [Queen] I accept this boy.

312
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,387
- So what else is new?

313
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,222
This is the porno
capital of the world.

314
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,458
- I've got a feeling this
guy's in some real rough stuff.

315
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:02,527
And besides, I think
he's using underage kids.

316
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:03,996
- Then give it to
Miller and Chavez,

317
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,864
if it's violent enough
they'll put a case together.

318
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,866
- I'd like to work
on this one myself.

319
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,537
- Betty, you don't
know shit from shinola

320
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,473
about porno investigations.

321
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,541
Let me tell you
something, nine out of 10

322
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:19,811
of these cases get thrown
out on a technicality.

323
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,814
These guys know how to make a
porno bust stand up in court.

324
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,783
- I'm sure they do, but
I think I could handle

325
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,952
the investigation just
as good as they could.

326
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,388
I'd like to try it myself,
nothing against them.

327
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,922
- You could learn a lot
from Miller and Chavez,

328
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,891
but not if you're
always pushing.

329
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,727
- But Captain,
among other things

330
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,429
they resent working with women.

331
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,630
- That's bullshit.

332
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:42,434
They resent competition,
especially from a
younger officer.

333
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,303
I know you mean well,

334
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,438
but you come on just
a little too strong.

335
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,172
- But Captain.

336
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:48,407
- But nothing.

337
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,444
Give the info to
Miller and Chavez

338
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:57,049
and I'll tell 'em
you're working with 'em.

339
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:57,849
- Yes sir.

340
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:04,323
- Six Victor Commander,
this is Six Victor 26

341
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,025
we're just about ready to
bust into Jessie's again,

342
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,427
even though I don't like it.

343
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:12,130
- [Jensen] Neither do I 26,
but if you don't Luchessi

344
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,533
might blow away half
the books in this town.

345
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,671
- Hey looks like Jessie's
doing some business today.

346
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,840
- [Ron] You know any
book maker that's not

347
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,442
doing business this time of day?

348
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,911
- Mm hmm.

349
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:30,749
Two dollar round robin, four
to six, and second and third.

350
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:31,883
Okay Freddy.

351
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,819
You got it, baby.

352
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:38,957
- Jessie my man, you got
something for a dry throat?

353
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,493
- You ain't set it
up for last week.

354
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:43,195
Now you want a freebie?

355
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,564
- Man you know I'm good for it.

356
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,199
Hey after the fourth race,

357
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,669
I'm gonna be making
the champagne sing.

358
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:52,371
- Two dollars a race,
all you're gonna

359
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,873
be making is the
soda water sing.

360
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,409
(upbeat music)

361
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,654
- If I make the stiff
I'll give you the signal.

362
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,256
Try and get the phone
while I'm still on it,

363
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:13,525
judges love that
kind of evidence.

364
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,428
(upbeat music)

365
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,676
(phone ringing)

366
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,078
- Hello?

367
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:33,979
Yeah.

368
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:37,315
- Yeah this is VK Arne.

369
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:41,553
Is number four scratched
in the third race?

370
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:45,056
Well let me have five
dollars across the board.

371
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:57,002
Yeah is High Top scratched in
the seventh race to Saratoga?

372
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:57,836
- Saratoga?

373
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,070
Hang on, I'll check.

374
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:02,641
- Go, go.

375
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,211
- We're off and running.

376
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:09,848
(intense music)

377
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,954
(loud crashing)

378
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,434
Move over there, Jesse.

379
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,206
Ron?

380
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,607
- Yeah he was taking
the third bet.

381
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,342
Did he wipe it off the table?

382
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,110
- No, come on over.

383
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,788
(yelping)

384
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,824
- Police officers, freeze.

385
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:53,758
- Oh my god.

386
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,228
- God help me, I'm crippled.

387
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,131
(screaming)

388
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,300
- Woman, shut your mouth.

389
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,170
- Why?

390
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,738
What the hell's going on here?

391
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:09,307
- Oh shit woman anytime
you see your face busting

392
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:13,478
on a book in the neighborhood,
you know they gotta be cops.

393
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:18,450
(yelping)

394
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:21,086
- Anybody see a search warrant?

395
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,756
- Why are you doing
this to me, Sergeant?

396
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,558
This is the third
bust in two months.

397
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,093
- I try to tell ya Jesse.

398
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,595
If you keep me busy
someplace else,

399
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,731
I wouldn't be
dropping in so often.

400
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:37,068
Like stiffing me at
the Luchessi operation.

401
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:39,604
- Man you must be smoking
some of that funny stuff.

402
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,873
That cat plays hardball.

403
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,874
I mean hard.

404
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,544
- Come on Jesse, you and
I go back a lot of years.

405
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,245
You know I wouldn't
put you up front.

406
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,648
- You don't have to,
he'll find out some way.

407
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:50,649
- How?

408
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:54,085
All you have to do is ID him,
I'll take care of the rest.

409
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,355
- Do you know how
mean that dude is?

410
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:58,890
He's got New York
in back of him.

411
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,358
- We're talking about extortion.

412
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,127
How much are you
paying him, Jesse?

413
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:05,430
- Come on Sarge, don't be
asking me questions like that.

414
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,432
- You know it's hard
for me to believe

415
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:09,467
that the books in this
town would knuckle under

416
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,803
to some strong arm
punk from back east.

417
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:16,942
- When you get old
the bones get brittle,

418
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,678
you don't move so fast, Sarge.

419
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:23,615
- For Christ sakes
Jesse, let me help you.

420
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,320
- I don't know, Sarge.

421
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:30,889
I don't know.

422
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:37,862

00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,448
- You know damn well
what I'm talking about.

449
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,683
Get your ass in the car, woman.

450
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:42,721
- [Woman] Just go home.

451
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,958
- She ain't been here long
enough to turn a trick.

452
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,294
- Hey you, you can keep
your big mouth shut,

453
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,062
if not I got something
you can put in it.

454
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,064
(loudly gawking)

455
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:56,501
Oh that's right, get smart,
get smart, and I'm gonna kick

456
00:28:56,501 --> 00:29:00,672
all you bitches asses 'cause
I'm a man, a real man.

457
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:01,506
- Yeah.

458
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,945
- I don't know what
pimps you all work for,

459
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:09,714
but you gonna sell
some pussy tonight.

460
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,129
- What's up?

461
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,997
- Captain wants to see us.

462
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,398
- Something hot?

463
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:28,600
- No code on it.

464
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,802
Something about a missing girl.

465
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:33,538
I figured we better do it
now though before you got

466
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:37,208
yourself involved with some
popcorn pimp or something.

467
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,197
So just why are we
getting involved

468
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,232
with a missing juvie story?

469
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,134
- Something the mother said.

470
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,570
Kid got hooked up
with Jim Walsh.

471
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,638
Ring a bell?

472
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,340
- Yeah, Pretty Girl Escorts.

473
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,275
- One in the same.

474
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,179
Here she is, Lori Stanton.

475
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,316
- Just how long ago
were these taken?

476
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:20,618
- A year and a half ago.

477
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,620
- She'll look 10
years older now.

478
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,590
- Any of his girls talk?

479
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:28,359
- Walsh's girls are too
terrified of him to roll over.

480
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:32,497
He's a ruthless bastard,
he'd kill anyone who talks.

481
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:36,100
- You know the thing about
Walsh is he keeps him on dope,

482
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,237
and when he's done with 'em
they either die or disappear.

483
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,840
But I got an idea
on just how we might

484
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:44,409
be able to operate
Walsh's short spot.

485
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:45,944
- I'm listening.

486
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,315
- We've all known how
Walsh and the others

487
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,183
have been selling,
renting, and leasing

488
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,552
whores to each other for years.

489
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:58,690
So why not nail his
ass for slavery?

490
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,457
- Slavery?

491
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:03,161
You've lost me, Hawk.

492
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,996
- Well now check this out.

493
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,532
Meet Edward DeBussey.

494
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,033
Yeah I like that.

495
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:12,237
See I just happen to be the
baddest dude to ever come from

496
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:16,207
Detroit, and I'm in the
pleasure business, the pleasure

497
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:21,212
business, and I gots to build
my stable, don't you know.

498
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,015
- Sounds risky.

499
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,184
- Yeah but what we
do is we buy girls

500
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,621
from Walsh and then
we nail his ass.

501
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30,622
- Come on Cap.

502
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,790
Look if this kid's working
for Walsh it's just

503
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,393
a matter of time before
she gets a hot shot.

504
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,230
- Slavery.

505
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,801
I love it.

506
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:44,936
Do it.

507
00:31:48,172 --> 00:31:51,209
(ominous music)

508
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:58,549
- Man I must be getting senile.

509
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,485
Even my mind's on vacation.

510
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:01,953
- Relax, Jesse.

511
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,291
- [Jesse] I have no
business being here.

512
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,760
- [Ron] Like being
owned by that punk.

513
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,361
- I don't wanna hear that trash.

514
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,299
- You'd rather hear the
sounds of your bones breaking.

515
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:19,370
That bastard will kill you once
he gets your betting codes.

516
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,906
Is that him?

517
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,743
- Yeah that's the Luchessi.

518
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,246
The one in the middle.

519
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:33,618
- Our number one is leaving
with two passengers.

520
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,754
Welcome to Hollywood, mother.

521
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,430
He's in a Chrysler limo.

522
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:57,508
It's going northbound.

523
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:58,910
Pick him up 26 Adam.

524
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,719
- We got him.

525
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:11,556
We're so close I feel
like part of the family.

526
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,160
- Lots of room,
he's hinky as hell.

527
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:18,997
- Oh shit.

528
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:24,235
- [Police Radio Woman] Six
Victor Six, an 80W victim

529
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,938
at Hollywood and Vine,
possibly Lori Stanton.

530
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,906
Check in advised,
Six Victor Commander.

531
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,076
- Roger 90, we're

- Doesn't ring a bell.

658
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,702
- Her neighbors are
convinced she's a hooker.

659
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,373
Your vice files indicate
that her street name was Lily

660
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:26,377
and she worked for an out call
service named Pretty Girl.

661

find a bank book.

669

might've helped her?

670
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,699
- Yeah, you got it.

671
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,469
What happened to the other guys?

672
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:55,005
- Sorry boss, we had
a late bust last night

673
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,974
then we had to be in
court this morning.

674

- So what's going on?

675
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,678
- Dead hooker.

676
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:01,946

713
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,892
See we're in the same kind
of business you and me,

714
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:56,260
only I'm taking
over the out call

715
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,828
business in this part of town.

716
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,196
Now if you work for
me, you'll be wearing

717
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,031
fine clothes and
driving a sports car.

718
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,266
And if you don't,
you're ass will be

719
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:03,901
collected welfare
some damn where.

720
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,870
Now get your ass on out of here
and think about what I said.

721
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:11,875
♪ That's shining to
guide me right through ♪

722
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:16,280
♪ My darkest days

723
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,384
- We're on our way.

724
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:26,056
- Don't worry boss, she just
went into Walsh's office.

725
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,525
We've got her covered
like stink on doo doo.

726
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,564
- I'm sorry, it's not my fault.

727
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,667
He said he was gonna
take over your business.

728
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,570
- Dirty cheap shit hustler.

729
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:42,740
Candy, get out of
here, get back to work.

730
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:49,113
Hey, if I hear you talk
to Mr. DeBussey again,

731
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,448
you'll be out of
business permanently.

732
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,756
Go pay that son of a
bitch a visit, will ya?

733
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:00,324
- My pleasure.

734
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,430
- You oughta keep your
eye on that little bitch.

735
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:08,365
And what about Lily?

736
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:10,067
- She checked out this morning.

737
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:13,137
- Easy come, easy go.

738
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:21,078
- One Carl Queen November 585.

739
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,015
- You get the Caddie?

740
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,350
- Does a sissy eat quiche?

741
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:27,818
- Come on man, I like quiche.

742
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,419
- You would, you hoto.

743
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:48,972
What are you doing, partner,
we gotta go do our homework.

744
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:49,706
- Come on man.

745
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,774
- Wait a minute, can't
we do something now?

746
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,509
They might be using
that minor in there.

747
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:55,078
- Yeah and some joker might
be leading a prayer meeting.

748
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:56,346
We don't go in
there until we know

749
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,781
what the hell we're doing.

750
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,183
- [Miller] That's right.

751
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:01,018
- This is the way we work.

752
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,420
We've got to get as much
information as possible

753
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:06,089
on the suspect to establish
enough probable cause

754
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:08,859
to satisfy a judge so he
can sign a search warrant.

755
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:10,561
- Yeah and then we gather
enough evidence to file

756
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:13,831
a case on the suspect, and
then we take 'em to court.

757
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:14,765
That's it, Betty.

758
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:18,635
- Yes sir.

759
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:30,581
So did you get
anything on the guy?

760
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,084
Uh hang on one second, okay?

761
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,191
Mom, hi.

762
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,159
- Hi.

763
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,361
- Come on in, I'm
just on long distance.

764
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,230
- Go right ahead, don't mind me.

765
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:49,433
- Sorry I had to get the door.

766
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:52,202
Uh so, any previous arrests?

767
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:53,971
Great.

768
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:57,274
No convictions, shit.

769
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:00,777
Yeah, well I'll call
Philly and Detroit.

770
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,713
- I hope the city is paying.

771
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,548
- Uh huh.

772
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:07,651
Well thanks a lot, thanks
a million, I owe you one.

773
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:08,752
Alright, bye bye.

774
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,160
Sorry, police business.

775
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,198
- Haven't you had enough fun
playing policeman, Elizabeth?

776
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:22,666
- That's police officer, Mom,

777
00:48:22,666 --> 00:48:25,135
and I'm not playing,
this is my career.

778
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:34,111
- But you could do so much
more with your education.

779
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:47,391
- Mom, drink your tea.

780
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,860
- How can I?

781
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:52,396
This cup has a chip in it.

782
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,604
(ominous music)

783
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:41,945
- Beautiful view from here.

784
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,982
Don't you agree, Jesse?

785
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:46,316
- Yeah I guess so.

786
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:49,286
What's the matter, Mr. Luchessi?

787
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,121
I've been making my
payments on time.

788
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:53,657
- It's not your payments,
it's your mouth.

789
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,725
- What are you talking about?

790
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:55,425
- I've been told you've been

791
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,627
getting cozy with
some cops lately.

792
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:59,162
- Man, where did
you hear that shit?

793
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,231
- Then you weren't
talking to vice?

794
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:04,301
- Yeah I was talking to
'em, but I can't help that.

795
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,303
They've been leaning
on me for years.

796
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,672
- You know Jesse, Willy
James and Harvey White

797
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,375
didn't follow instructions and
they're in the hospital now.

798
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:15,145
You see this is an equal
opportunity business.

799
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:16,580
- Come on, Mr. Luchessi.

800
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,715
- My friends in New York
don't like your actions,

801
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:19,716
and that bothers me.

802
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:22,319
I don't want to hear you talking

803
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,421
to vice unless
you're being busted.

804
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,095
Come on fellas, not in the face,

805
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:34,297
I spent a fortune
on this bridge work.

806
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:40,003
(grunting)

807
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,843
- Hello sweetheart, it's me.

808
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:49,146
- [Wife] Oh hi sweetheart,
I'm so glad you called.

809
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:49,679
- What's the matter?

810
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:50,680
- [Wife] Oh it's Pumpkin,

811
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,682
she won't go to bed until
she can talk to you.

812
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:54,251
- Oh okay, put her on.

813
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:55,118
- [Wife] Okay, say hi honey.

814
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:55,952
- [Pumpkin] Hi Daddy.

815
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:58,488
- Hello pumpkin,
how's my little girl?

816
00:50:58,488 --> 00:50:59,890
- [Pumpkin] I'm fine.

817
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,158
- You go to bed Pumpkin.

818
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:03,527
I'll see you in the morning
and maybe we can go to the zoo.

819
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:04,928
- They're moving, Daddy.

820
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:06,663
- I gotta run, sweetheart.

821
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:10,467
- [Pumpkin] Oh may we have
popcorn and cotton candy?

822
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,569
- Yes sweetheart, I'll see
you later, I've got to run.

823
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,870
- Come on, Daddy.

824
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:15,305
- I promise, Pumpkin.

825
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:22,646
(intense music)

826
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:46,870
- They gotta be cops.

827
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,972
Who else would be tailing us?

828
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,408
- Take me home.

829
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,283
- Ron, stop the car.

830
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:00,917
- What for?

831
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:01,618
- Back up.

00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:41,518
You must be the proprietor
of Pretty Girl Escorts.

857
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,221
- Well you might say
I'm a representative.

858
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,422
- Representative?

859
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:52,028
You hear that baby they
sent me, me a representative.

860
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:58,168
Hey lookie here, sucker, I
don't deal with representatives.

861
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:00,770
So the door's right
behind you, dig it?

862
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:03,807
- I don't think you
quite understand.

863
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:06,576
- No baby, you don't understand.

864
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,945
Take a look behind you.

865
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:20,223
Now get your representative ass

866
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:22,626
on out of here while
you've still got one.

867
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,936
- We'll be in touch.

868
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:37,974
- Hey and you tell
them I said I deal

869
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:41,278
with the top dog or
I don't deal at all.

870
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:51,588
Well guys the way I
figure it's gonna take

871
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:54,658
that scumbag about 25
minutes to get back to Walsh,

872
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:57,227
it's gonna take Walsh another
five minutes to recover

873
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:58,728
and then he's gonna
say something like,

874
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:02,599
who does the Black man think
he is to talk to us like that.

875
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,901
Hey we've got a good
half an hour to kill,

876
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:07,070
somebody order a
pizza or something.

877
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,107
- He called me representative.

878
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:14,477
He says he doesn't deal
with representatives.

879
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:21,017
- Who the fuck does that goddamn
Black bastard think he is!?

880
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,969
(phone ringing)

881
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:48,111
- Uh yeah?

882
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:51,981
Oh Mr. Walsh, what
can I do you for?

883
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:54,317
- Listen I was a
little curious about

884
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:57,320
your business plans here
in Hollywood and I thought

885
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:00,557
perhaps we might be able
to have a meeting, sir.

886
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:01,524
- Why not.

887
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,525
Hey I'll tell you what,

888
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,929
since I'm new in town I'll
even let you pick the place.

889
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:08,131
- [Walsh] Eight o'clock
at Ruby Lee's on Vine.

890
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,366
- Sounds good.

891
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,333
You and me.

892
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:11,835
- [Walsh] Right, sir.

893
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:16,339
- We're in business.

894
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:17,173
- Alright.

895
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:24,280
- Mr. DeBussey, Mr. DePussy.

896
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:30,253
- I think we better
be careful, Jim,

897
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:32,055
this guy could be a bad dude.

898
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:34,424
- Well we'll do
to him what we do

899
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:40,263
to all the bad
dudes, call Daniello.

900
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:01,618
- Sweetheart.

901
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:02,986
- Would you stop.

902
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:10,093
- [Waitress] Here you
are sir, your brandy.

903
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:14,664
Okay I'll put that on
the tab for you, sure.

904
00:57:23,573 --> 00:57:25,308
- This won't take but a minute.

905
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:27,043
He'll bite.

906
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:29,212
- [Waitress] One second
sir, I'll be right with you.

907
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:36,953
- Mr. Walsh.

908
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,721
- Yes sir, sit down.

909
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,092
Would you like a drink?

910
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,462
- Yeah, let me have
a scotch and water.

911
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,730
- [Waitress] Hi there,
you ready to order?

912
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:48,932
- I'll have a margarita.

913
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,233
What are you gonna have?

914
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:51,768
- Something fruity.

915
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:52,836
Singapore sling.

916
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:53,436
- [Waitress] Okay.

917
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:57,106
- And give my friend a Roy
Rogers, two cherries please.

918
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:58,608
- [Waitress] Alright.

919
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:04,547
- So, tell me a little
about your business here.

920
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:10,453
- I deal in works of art,
only the finest works of art.

921
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:13,957
- I think I can be of assistance
to you because I happen

922
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:18,962
to have an outstanding
collection of good pieces.

923
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:21,498
- What terms?

924
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:23,166
- Oh you could
buy them outright,

925
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,903
or you could lease them say
six months to the crack.

926
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:28,037
Pardon the pun.

927
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:33,076
- No problem.

928
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:42,619
- I have the best looking
young pussy you ever saw.

929
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,221
Fuck art.

930
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:52,295
- Yeah, you talk
like my kind of man.

931
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:54,597
We'll do some business.

932
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:58,434
- Yeah, art.

933
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:05,475
- What do you say, Picasso.

934
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:07,710
(laughing)

935
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:16,619
- Look man, I was at the
hospital and I forgot.

936
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:18,588
- Oh don't give me that crap.

937
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:20,390
You said you were gonna
meet us this morning.

938
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,524
Where were you?

939
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,160
- The deal's off.

940
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,895
I'd rather live.

941
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,196
- Are you out of your mind?

942
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,965
Luchessi already has
his finger on you.

943
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:30,700
If some blue suiter
stops him for a ticket,

944
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,002
he'll put you back
in the hospital.

945
00:59:33,002 --> 00:59:37,006
- Look Sarge, you
catch me dirty bust me,

946
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:39,008
if not then back off.

947
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:42,445
- Come off it Jesse.

948
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:48,418
We know Luchessi's doing
a number on all the books.

949
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,686
If we don't get cooperation,

950
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:52,322
the alley's will be filled
with books and betters

951
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:54,490
waiting to be scooped
up by the paramedics.

952
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:59,329
Right now we're the
only friends you have.

953
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:02,932
- This body can't
afford your friendship.

954
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:07,637
I'll take my chances,
so just leave me be.

955
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:11,207
- Suit yourself.

956
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:12,041
Let's go.

957
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,651
Stay as close to
him as possible,

958
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:23,353
Luchessi's next step
might be murder.

959
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:24,187
- Yes sir.

960
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:44,741
(tense music)

961
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,912
(phone ringing)

962
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:34,183
- Yeah.

963
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:35,885
Hey look she knew there
were certain hazards

964
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:38,488
involved with using
nipple clamps, alright?

965
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,790
And look so what if
they're black and blue,

966
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:43,459
use a little makeup to
cover them up, okay?

967
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:44,293
Alright?

968
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:45,128
Ciao.

969
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:50,399
(tense music)

970
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:10,720
- God dammit Betty,
you can't do those

971
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,989
kinds of things,
it's against the law.

972
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,724
- But I caught the
degenerate cold.

973
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,959
- We can't use any of that
stuff as probable cause.

974
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:18,494
Everything you did was illegal.

975
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:19,695
Frankie, talk to her.

976
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:20,530
- Hey.

977
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,499
- I have other evidence.

978
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,702
- Christ, I'm afraid to ask.

979
01:03:26,702 --> 01:03:28,171
- Listen to me.

980
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:29,939
First, our man has several busts

981
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,141
in New York and Philly for
S&M but no convictions.

982
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,544
Second, I ran those plates
and came up with the name

983
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:37,313
Nesbitt, a cameraman who
was busted for child porno

984
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,582
five years ago here in LA,
he did six months in county.

985
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:41,350
Wait I'll show you.

986
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:43,119
Oh shit, hi Captain.

987
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:48,291
- What's going on?

988
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:49,959
- We underestimated her, right.

989
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:51,761
- Yeah, case is looking good.

990
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:27,697
- Mr. DeBussey.

991
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,131
- It's DeBussey.

992
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:30,333
- Right, right.

993
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:33,135
Have you made a
decision, Mr. DeBussey?

994
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:35,972
- I'd like three girls.

995
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:39,508
- [Walsh] Have you made
up your mind on the terms?

996
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:42,445
- I want to buy them outright.

997
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:45,014
So how much?

998
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:48,050
- We'll talk about that
later after the showing.

999
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:51,554
- Tonight I'm gonna take
care of a convention,

1000
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:53,923
I'd like the three
to attend a party.

1001
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:56,525
- Yeah no, no, no
parties, no, no, no.

1002
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:58,361
- Makes it too
easy for rip offs.

1003
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:03,833
- The cops like to use parties.

1004
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:07,503
- So what's your proposition?

1005
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,574
- I'll call you a
few hours before

1006
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,176
the convention and
give you the details.

1007
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:18,080
- You have a nice
day, eh, Mr. DeBussey.

1008
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:19,749
- That's right.

1009
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:34,430
(intense music)

1010
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:50,379
- Why don't we just prowl?

1011
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,615
- I'll do it.

1012
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,683
- The warrants are tight.

1013
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:57,086
See anything good just add
it and give us an update.

1014
01:05:57,086 --> 01:05:58,087
- If we're lucky.

1015
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:07,730
- I keep thinking
about that poor kid.

1016
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:11,200
You've gotta be crazy
to do that kind of shit.

1017
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:13,936
- No brains, no headaches.

1018
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:20,376
(distant screaming)

1019
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:26,716
- Something's up.

1020
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:34,023
- Some bastard's in there
screaming like a banshee,

1021
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:35,925
and all the lights are on,
they've gotta be shooting.

1022
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:37,927
- I'll call it in, someone
can run it over to a judge.

1023
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:38,794
- What do you mean call it in?

1024
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:39,929
By the time we get
a warrant signed,

1025
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:41,564
some poor kid will be history.

1026
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:43,866
- Without a warrant
we can lose the case.

1027
01:06:43,866 --> 01:06:46,769
- Hey come on she's right Tom,
screw the warrant, screw it.

1028
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:50,940
- Fuck it vamanos.

1029
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:54,010
(intense music)

1030
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:04,754
Take the back in case
anyone tries to split.

1031
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:13,162
(loud crashing)

1032
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:15,731
- Hey, get the fuck out of here.

1033
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,036
God damn cops!

1034
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:24,607
(women screaming)

1035
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:26,042
Get the hell out!

1036
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:30,646
(women screaming)

1037
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,721
(loud crashing)

1038
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:44,226
- [Man] What the
hell's going on.

1039
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,961
- [Woman] No, get away.

1040
01:07:49,698 --> 01:07:52,535
- [Frankie] You
shut the fuck up!

1041
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,472
(glass shattering)

1042
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,741
(groaning)

1043
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:06,048
(loud thudding)

1044
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:12,154
(whistling)

1045
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:15,925
- Please try to run, barf bag.

1046
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:17,927
- Need any help?

1047
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:20,863
- Yeah, could I
borrow your cuffs?

1048
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:23,265
- Anytime, partner.

1049
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:31,407
(knocking on door)

1050
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:35,744
- I wasn't at the
hotel when you called,

1051
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:37,913
but I came as soon as
I got your message.

1052
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:38,814
- Please sit down.

1053
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:43,319
I'm sorry.

1054
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,055
- Oh she isn't?

1055
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:47,490
- No.

1056
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:49,959
(sighing)

1057
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:53,362
This Jim Walsh you
were telling me about,

1058
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:56,999
he runs an out call
service called Pretty Girl.

1059
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:01,270
- I don't understand.

1060
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:07,810
- Your daughter's a prostitute.

1061
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,480
- That's ridiculous.

1062
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:16,886
Your best detectives have
come up with the wrong Walsh.

1063
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:18,888
That's not my Lori.

1064
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:21,524
- I'm sorry Pauline, but
we haven't made a mistake.

1065
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:27,429
And I'm afraid it's worse.

1066
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:29,999
She's on heroin.

1067
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:40,242
(humming happily)

1068
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:09,305
- Why you come
busting in my house?

1069
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:11,373
I've done nothing wrong.

1070
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:16,779
- Jesse, you put me in
a very bad mood lately.

1071
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:22,051
Your friends the cops, they've
been following me around.

1072
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,286
- I told you they
ain't my friends.

1073
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:27,223
How many fucking times
do I have to tell you?

1074
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:28,524
I've been playing ball.

1075
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:44,840
(glass shattering)

1076
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:50,980
(loud thudding)

1077
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:29,184
- Alright guys, let's
go down to the station,

1078
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:30,552
this shouldn't take too long.

1079
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:32,721
- This ain't gonna
take too long neither.

1080
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:34,990
(groaning)

1081
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:37,726
- Hey, what the
hell are you doing?

1082
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:39,862
- I want some more
of that mother.

1083
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:47,836
Pretty good for
an old fart, huh?

1084
01:11:58,113 --> 01:11:59,381
- Daniello, how are you doing?

1085
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:00,049
- Beautiful.

1086
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:00,883
- You're looking good.

1087
01:12:00,883 --> 01:12:01,583
- Thanks.

1088
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:02,117
- Working?

1089
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:02,885
- Sure.

1090
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:03,919
- [Farber] Staying
out of trouble?

1091
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:04,953
- Sure.

1092
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,890
- [Farber] Mr. Walsh has a nice
piece of work for you here.

1093
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,993
- Daniello, look I really don't
expect any problem tonight,

1094
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:14,229
but it pays to have
a little insurance.

1095
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:18,534
Look you remember our
little talk on the phone?

1096
01:12:18,534 --> 01:12:19,068
- Yeah.

1097
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:21,070
- You know where to go,
you know what to do?

1098
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,238
If he doesn't fuck her
that means it's a scam

1099
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:24,840
and you've gotta waste him.

1100
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:31,647
Daniello.

1101
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:39,822
I don't need any
witnesses either.

1102
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:41,523
- Beautiful.

1103
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,560
- You're the best.

1104
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,728
- So are you, pal.

1105
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:59,041
(phone ringing)

1106
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:03,712
- You got me.

1107
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:05,848
Uh huh.

1108
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:10,285
Diamond Gems on Hollywood
Boulevard, half an hour.

1109
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:15,624
- Okay this is it, don't let
him slip through our fingers.

1110
01:13:15,624 --> 01:13:16,892
- We'll take care of it.

1111
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:18,827
It's party time.

1112
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:24,233
(upbeat music)

1113
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:28,637
- [Man] Arthur,
Arthur right here.

1114
01:13:32,474 --> 01:13:35,778
- Hey Mr. DeBussey,
right on time, sir.

1115
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,113
And this is Veronica.

1116
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:39,248
- Nice to meet you.

1117
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:44,620
- Veronica is my associate as
well as being my main lady.

1118
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:46,789
Why don't you ask
your lady to join us?

1119
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:48,824
(snapping)

1120
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:53,395
Ah, that's terrific.

1121
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,298
We're a regular foursome.

1122
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:58,167
- [Hawkins] Yeah just
like the rich folks.

1123
01:13:58,167 --> 01:13:59,334
- Right.

1124
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:02,004
- Let's do what they do
and take care of business.

1125
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:15,951
- I've uh, I've got two works
of art set up for tonight.

1126
01:14:15,984 --> 01:14:16,919
- Two?

1127
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:18,720
I asked for three.

1128
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,355
- We start with two.

1129
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:21,356
They'll provide
the entertainment

1130
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,158
for the boys at the bar
there and if everything

1131
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:25,494
goes alright, you'll
get the third one.

1132
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:28,430
- Man, what are
you talking about?

1133
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:32,968
- Look I don't know you,
I don't know your clients.

1134
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:35,204
You could be cops, you're
ripping me off trying to steal

1135
01:14:35,204 --> 01:14:38,774
my girls from me, so let's just
take it one step at a time.

1136
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,242
Alright?

1137
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:42,044
If you and the boys are what you

1138
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:45,914
say you are there's no problem.

1139
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:49,251
But I'm the one who has
everything to lose, see?

1140
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:52,254
So I'm taking control
of this situation.

1141
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:55,491
- Well now let's see.

1142
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,893
You expect me to
send my two men off

1143
01:14:57,893 --> 01:15:01,196
while you keep that
gorilla at my back.

1144
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:02,397
- No, no, no, no.

1145
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:05,534
You mean Farber here,
he goes with them.

1146
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:08,003
- That way they won't be lonely.

1147
01:15:08,704 --> 01:15:12,274
- This ain't business,
this is bullshit man!

1148
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:17,779
- How's that uh, how's
that expression go uh,

1149
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:20,949
oh yeah, take it or leave it.

1150
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:25,053
(snapping)

1151
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:28,223
- Yeah boss.

1152
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:31,727
- The man here is
full of fun and games,

1153
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:34,463
wants to two of you to
trick two of his ladies.

1154
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:37,533
- Alright a little
fringe benefit, huh?

1155
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:40,736
- Here, just in case you don't

1156
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:42,838
have enough charm for a freebie.

1157
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:49,978
- I'm telling you man, that
son of a bitch is no fool.

1158
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:51,947
- Someone gets to make a call.

1159
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:58,120
(intense music)

1160
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:13,068
- Oh god, I feel awful.

1161
01:16:15,470 --> 01:16:17,039
I wish he'd get here.

1162
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:24,680
(cocking gun repeatedly)

1163
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:34,923
Do you have to play with
that thing, Daniello?

1164
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,825
- Aren't we jumpy.

1165
01:16:36,825 --> 01:16:40,128
I just bet you could use
something to calm your nerves.

1166
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:41,964
- [Lori] No kidding.

1167
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:44,766
- Just do your job and
you'll get your shit.

1168
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,336
It'll be very groovy.

1169
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:50,906
- I just wish the
guy would show up

1170
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:52,808
so we could get this over with.

1171
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:59,081
- You should meditate,
it's beautiful.

1172
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:02,384
- Oh great.

1173
01:17:13,428 --> 01:17:16,565
- So pal, how'd
you get this job?

1174
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:19,034
- Go fuck yourself.

1175
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:22,704
- Must've went to college.

1176
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:27,175
- Excuse me, time for
the little boys room.

1177
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:28,910
- Wait, wait, do me
a favor will you?

1178
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,046
Just humor me one more time.

1179
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:35,417
Look under the table and take
a look at Veronica's snatch.

1180
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:36,485
- Say what?

1181
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:39,488
- [Walsh] You won't believe it.

1182
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:49,398
- My man, your elevator don't
quite make it to the top.

1183
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,068
- I can guarantee he's not gonna

1184
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:54,970
see anything he
hasn't seen before.

1185
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:02,511
- Go ahead, please.

1186
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,486
Isn't that something.

1187
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:18,794
- What's the matter, baby?

1188
01:18:18,794 --> 01:18:21,863
- Just sit there quietly
and enjoy your drink, puta.

1189
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:24,399
- What's going on?

1190
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:28,070
- Nothing, just a
weird sense of humor.

1191
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:32,808
Chick here is giving brand new
life to the term beaver shot.

1192
01:18:35,077 --> 01:18:36,378
- That's funny.

1193
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:39,347
(laughing)

1194
01:18:56,898 --> 01:19:01,269
- Okay it's room 208, all you
gotta do is say Jim sent me.

1195
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:05,741
Oh ho, ho, no, no, no, nobody
said anything about orgies.

1196
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:06,875
Just the chink here.

1197
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:12,814
That way you have
your own private pad.

1198
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:14,750
Now you get in
the car and drive.

1199
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:16,518
You enjoy yourself.

1200
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:20,388
- Remember Ray if you
touch her we lose the case.

1201
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:21,690
- [Farber] Get in the car.

1202
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:22,924
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1203
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:40,942
- Hey man I'm not gonna
do anything stupid, okay.

1204
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:44,379
You get her to point that
thing somewhere else,

1205
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:46,181
accidents do happen.

1206
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:50,452
- If I blow your balls off
it won't be an accident.

1207
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:53,388
- Just a little while
longer, alright?

1208
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:56,424
If everything's okay, your
house boy's gonna be alright.

1209
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:58,560
- What's that supposed to mean?

1210
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,062
- If the China man plays
any games, there's a shotgun

1211
01:20:01,062 --> 01:20:03,298
in the closet that'll
give him a radical lesson.

1212
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:04,633
- [Walsh] Shut up!

1213
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:28,356
(knocking on door)

1214
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:52,180
- Who are you?

1215
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:54,616
- Oh uh Jim sent me.

1216
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:57,252
- Hey man I don't
give a shit about your

1217
01:20:57,252 --> 01:20:59,287
fun and games right, but I
gotta go to the bathroom.

1218
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:00,589
If I don't get
there soon I'm gonna

1219
01:21:00,622 --> 01:21:02,824
piss in my pants and
this here is silk, man.

1220
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:07,062
- Cross your legs.

1221
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:15,303
(loud crashing)

1222
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:18,073
(gun shots blasting)

1223
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:31,620
(loud thudding)

1224
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:36,258
Ow!

1225
01:21:44,199 --> 01:21:45,767
Somebody stop him!

1226
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:52,073
- [Woman] Oh, is
the food that bad?

1227
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:55,877
- Like a drink?

1228
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,013
- Yeah sure, that'd be fine.

1229
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:14,396
(intense music)

1230
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:25,173
Uh listen would you uh
mind if I wash my hands?

1231
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,175
I'll be right back.

1232
01:22:56,905 --> 01:23:00,208
- She says her name is Veronica
Ramos and she's not talking.

1233
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:01,609
- Dammit.

1234
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:04,512
We don't have much time,
now make a deal with her

1235
01:23:04,512 --> 01:23:07,882
if you have to but find out
where Chang and Stevens are.

1236
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,317
- Yes sir.

1237
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:16,658
- What are you looking
at me like that for?

1238
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:18,593
I'm going to the
hospital, not the morgue.

1239
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:21,062
- Hey baby, we almost met it.

1240
01:23:21,062 --> 01:23:23,999
- He's gonna pay for
this and it's on you.

1241
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:25,967
- You got it.

1242
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:32,140
- That's it, that's
all you heard?

1243
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:36,411
Just a shotgun in the closet,
no location, nothing else?

1244
01:23:36,411 --> 01:23:37,178
- [Hawkins] That's it, Captain.

1245
01:23:37,212 --> 01:23:38,580
- Excuse me, Captain.

1246
01:23:38,813 --> 01:23:40,448
- What have you got?

1247
01:23:40,448 --> 01:23:42,917
- Tropicana Motel,
Santa Monica Boulevard.

1248
01:23:42,917 --> 01:23:44,619
- Great, room number?

1249
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:50,358
Judy, you handle things
here, I'm gonna find Chang.

1250
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:51,092
- Alright.

1251
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:52,560
- I'm gonna borrow this.

1252
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:56,197
- And you've got to find Walsh.

1253
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:04,973
(sirens blaring)

1254
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:07,709
- [Jensen] Six Victor
Commander, the Tropicana Motel

1255
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:10,879

Boulevard, request backup.

1256

1258
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:27,562
- Straight ahead, huh?

1259
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:28,863
- Yeah.

1260
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:37,739
- You know what I've been
thinking about doing?

1261
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:40,408
- No, what's that?

1262
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:44,245
(tires screeching)

1263
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:50,819
- All clean.

1264
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:51,653
- Great.

1265
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:54,622
Why don't you take
your jacket off?

1266
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:56,991
- [Chang] Take my jacket off.

1267
01:24:58,626 --> 01:24:59,861
Sure.

1268
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:01,429
- Make yourself comfortable.

1269
01:25:03,498 --> 01:25:07,569
Yeah right here on the bed
that's fine, just lay it down.

1270
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:12,107
(intense music)

1271
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:24,686
- Yeah boss?

1272
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:26,387
- Chang doesn't know it,
but there's a shooter

1273
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:28,423
hiding in the closet
with a shotgun.

1274
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:32,026
- Oh shit.

1275
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:33,962
Cuff that asshole
in the front seat.

1276
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:38,032
- Do you believe the weather
we've been having lately?

1277
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:41,536
- Come on, let's get it on.

1278
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:50,745
What are you waiting for?

1279
01:25:51,546 --> 01:25:52,714
Get undressed.

1280
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:55,950
- [Chang] Hey baby,
what's the hurry.

1281
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:58,052
We haven't even talked
about business yet.

1282
01:25:59,053 --> 01:26:01,089
- If we scare this
guy he'll open fire.

1283
01:26:01,089 --> 01:26:02,223
We don't know
which room he's in.

1284
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:04,993
- Well I know what
room he's in, 208.

1285
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:05,760
- Great.

1286
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:07,362
Now let's get a
map of this place

1287
01:26:07,395 --> 01:26:09,397
and I want you to try to get
into the bathroom window.

1288
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:10,231
Can you do that?

1289
01:26:10,231 --> 01:26:10,698
- You bet.

1290
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:11,533
- Let's go.

1291
01:26:14,636 --> 01:26:15,737
- Uh.

1292
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:20,975
How much?

1293
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:25,446
- $200 up front.

1294
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:30,985
- [Chang] And what
do I get for my $200?

1295
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:35,156
- Anything you want.

1296
01:26:43,431 --> 01:26:45,033
- Listen you think I
could get another drink?

1297
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:46,568
I'm really thirsty.

1298
01:26:48,803 --> 01:26:51,472

1310
01:29:35,269 --> 01:29:37,338

1312
01:29:48,282 --> 01:29:50,852

(gun shot blasting)

1314
01:30:07,668 --> 01:30:09,704
- I don't know anything else.

1315
01:30:09,737 --> 01:30:12,240
Why would they tell me any
of those things anyway?

1316
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:17,245
- Well we'll be in touch.

1317
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,481
Now your mother's outside.

1318
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:23,618
- What?

1319
01:30:25,887 --> 01:30:27,121
I don't wanna see her.

1320
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,761
She didn't care about me.

1321
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:38,433
All she thinks about is
what other people say.

1322
01:30:40,902 --> 01:30:42,837
- You're being pretty
hard on her, aren't you?

1323
01:30:43,805 --> 01:30:46,574
- What do you know
about any of this?

1324
01:30:46,607 --> 01:30:49,377
- I know a policeman's
in the hospital

1325
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:52,113
and a couple of your asshole
friends are in the morgue.

1326
01:30:52,113 --> 01:30:53,381
And if it wasn't
for your mother,

1327
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:55,349
you would probably be
in there with them.

1328
01:30:56,083 --> 01:30:58,719
If it wasn't for her, nobody
would care if you screwed

1329
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:04,025
your brains out, or rotted in
jail, or OD'd on that shit.

1330
01:31:05,393 --> 01:31:08,763
When you mother found
out you might be in LA,

1331
01:31:08,763 --> 01:31:12,533
she dropped everything and came
out here searching for you.

1332
01:31:13,768 --> 01:31:15,403
She's gone through hell.

1333
01:31:17,238 --> 01:31:19,774
Does that sound like
somebody who doesn't care?

1334
01:31:22,343 --> 01:31:27,114
Listen Lori, maybe your
mother did make some mistakes,

1335
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:30,451
but it should be obvious
that she loves you very much,

1336
01:31:31,953 --> 01:31:34,121
and that you both
need each other.

1337
01:31:34,789 --> 01:31:35,823
- Right.

1338
01:31:47,368 --> 01:31:48,703
- You think about it.

1339
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:02,817
- [Announcer] Sixth
floor nursing supervisor,

1340
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:03,751
call your office.

1341
01:32:08,389 --> 01:32:12,026
- Pauline I'm sorry, she
doesn't want to see you.

1342
01:32:23,137 --> 01:32:25,373
Give her time, she's
been through a lot.

1343
01:32:26,507 --> 01:32:28,142
- [Lori] Mom?

1344
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:51,566
(crying)

1345
01:33:22,063 --> 01:33:23,598
- Why do you do this to me?

1346
01:33:23,631 --> 01:33:25,466
- Look, will you
just give me my hat?

1347
01:33:25,466 --> 01:33:26,000
- No.

1348
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:26,968
- Why?

1349
01:33:27,001 --> 01:33:30,271
- Because this is stupid,
it's the middle of July.

1350
01:33:30,304 --> 01:33:31,939
- How long have we
known each other?

1351
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:33,341
- Five years.

1352
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:35,443
- And in all that
time have I ever done

1353
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:37,578
anything to make you
question my judgment?

1354
01:33:37,578 --> 01:33:38,346
- Yes.

1355
01:33:38,379 --> 01:33:39,580
- [Chang] What do you mean yes?

1356
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:41,749

you dressed up like a rabbi?

1357

- And the Shriner?

1359

- Alright, alright I'm
human, I make mistakes.

1360
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:48,222
- And how about when you
dressed up like a wiener?

1361
01:33:48,222 --> 01:33:49,457
A god damn wiener.

1362
01:33:49,457 --> 01:33:52,360
