1
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,533
<i>A bottle of sulfuric acid was dropped</i>

2
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:17,084
<i>from a high place
to Mongkok's pedestrian zone last week.</i>

3
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:19,635
<i>This is the third case already.</i>

4
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,846
<i>The number of casualties are over 100 now.</i>

5
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,674
<i>This grave offense has prompted the police</i>

6
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,418
<i>to offer a reward of 900,000 dollars</i>

7
00:02:25,503 --> 00:02:27,714
<i>for anyone with any information</i>

8
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:29,967
<i>about these cases.</i>

9
00:02:30,052 --> 00:02:31,285
<i>Please contact 277-117-77.</i>

10
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,287
May I help you, miss?

11
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,703
Three cups of lychee juice with honey.

12
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:34,745
More lychees, fewer bees.

13
00:02:34,828 --> 00:02:35,953
I mean more lychees, less honey.

14
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:37,912
Also, get me some yogurt,
chocolates, apples,

15
00:02:37,995 --> 00:02:39,536
mangoes, blueberries,
and watermelon sorbet.

16
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,620
They're all mine. Thank you.

17
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:55,036
Hello.

18
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:55,953
<i>Johnston?</i>

19
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:56,911
Where are you?

20
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:57,911
<i>I'm working on a case.</i>

21
00:02:57,994 --> 00:02:58,869
You're not free?

22
00:02:59,203 --> 00:03:00,244
I want to give you a treat.

23
00:03:00,328 --> 00:03:02,119
I'm working on a case.

24
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:15,744
Ho?

25
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:16,911
<i>Do you copy?</i>

26
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:18,077
<i>Ho?</i>

27
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:19,077
Yes. Mission accomplished.

28
00:03:19,161 --> 00:03:20,369
I got everything. I'm on my way.

29
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:21,827
Wait a second.

30
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,660
Do you see the blind man behind you?

31
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:25,327
Where?

32
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,702
At your seven o'clock.

33
00:03:26,785 --> 00:03:28,660
The one in a dark blue suit.

34
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:30,410
Yes, I see him. What's up?

35
00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:31,660
<i>Follow him.</i>

36
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:33,077
Follow him?

37
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:36,285
Chief Szeto, the sorbet will melt.
You have to drink it when it's still cold.

38
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:38,368
Follow him. Find out what he's up to.

39
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:39,368
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

40
00:04:15,326 --> 00:04:16,409
I'm off duty, honey.

41
00:04:16,493 --> 00:04:18,201
I'll go and buy some groceries for dinner.

42
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:21,284
Are you coming back for dinner?

43
00:04:21,784 --> 00:04:23,284
You haven't come back for two days.

44
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:24,409
Return my call.

45
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:52,867
Chief Szeto, the blind man
is following someone.

46
00:04:53,117 --> 00:04:53,992
Who?

47
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:56,533
<i>A fat guy in a white-striped shirt.</i>

48
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:38,574
Bitch!

49
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,407
You think I know nothing
between you and the driver?

50
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,491
You fucked him in a truck!
You seduced him!

51
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:46,741
Go to hell! Don't ever come back!

52
00:05:47,657 --> 00:05:48,532
We're finished!

53
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:53,990
What is he looking at?

54
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:55,990
<i>Check it out!</i>

55
00:06:09,865 --> 00:06:13,782
<i>Honey, forgive me.</i>

56
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:15,615
You may fuck him in the truck.

57
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:19,365
Remember to roll down the window.

58
00:06:19,865 --> 00:06:24,948
It's dangerous to inhale the fumes.

59
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,740
Honey, I'll wait for you.

60
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:29,156
Come home.

61
00:06:41,406 --> 00:06:42,739
Do you want a plastic bag?

62
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:43,864
Yes.

63
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:49,114
The fat guy is the suspect.
Don't lose him.

64
00:06:49,198 --> 00:06:50,031
We'll be right there.

65
00:06:50,114 --> 00:06:50,947
Time for some action.

66
00:06:51,072 --> 00:06:51,947
Call for backup.

67
00:06:53,322 --> 00:06:54,156
Excuse me.

68
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,156
Yes?

69
00:06:56,364 --> 00:06:58,197
Is this orange juice, gorgeous?

70
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:00,531
It's sulfuric acid.

71
00:07:02,572 --> 00:07:03,656
Thank you, gorgeous.

72
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:31,072
He followed the fat guy
into the Wing Mansion.

73
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:32,238
I'll be following them inside.

74
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,321
Team A, disperse the crowd.

75
00:08:10,654 --> 00:08:12,487
Team B, shut down all exits.

76
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:13,654
Team C, follow me.

77
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:25,279
Evacuate! It's dangerous here!

78
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,820
<i>Organized Crime Triad Bureau.</i>

79
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:31,862
I have very reliable sources.

80
00:08:32,362 --> 00:08:33,529
My name is Johnston,

81
00:08:34,112 --> 00:08:40,028
ID card number, G196262.

82
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,237
Freeze!

83
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,653
I'm Szeto Fatbo, Chief Inspector of OCTB.

84
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:51,070
It hurts!

85
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:54,028
Watch out for my face.

86
00:08:54,111 --> 00:08:55,653
Looks is important
for handsome guys like me.

87
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:56,820
Okay!

88
00:08:56,945 --> 00:08:57,903
A lady cop?

89
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:23,569
You're under arrest.

90
00:09:23,986 --> 00:09:25,277
You have the right to remain silent.

91
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:27,402
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

92
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,486
Good martial arts, better than Susan.

93
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:32,986
Szeto Fatbo!

94
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:35,444
{\an8}<i>Chief Szeto, how was this case solved?</i>

95
00:09:35,527 --> 00:09:37,735
<i>Our team teamed up with
the Criminal Intelligence Bureau</i>

96
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:40,610
<i>to set up surveillance
around the pedestrian zone.</i>

97
00:09:40,985 --> 00:09:43,402
<i>Tonight, we spotted the suspect,</i>

98
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:45,360
<i>so I promptly sent an officer
to follow him.</i>

99
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:47,194
<i>He was later found on the rooftop.</i>

100
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:50,068
<i>As soon as I arrived there, I took action.</i>

101
00:09:50,318 --> 00:09:51,568
<i>I dispersed the crowd in the area</i>

102
00:09:51,652 --> 00:09:52,818
<i>and captured the suspect.</i>

103
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:54,152
<i>We finally arrested him.</i>

104
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:57,610
<i>Was there any resistance
during the arrest?</i>

105
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,777
Hello.

106
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,318
So you're Johnston,
Â«the brilliant detective?

107
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,568
My name is Ho.

108
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,985
Johnston.

109
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,651
Are you all right?

110
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:16,235
Do you realize how dangerous it was?

111
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:17,318
Luckily, we arrived on time.

112
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:19,693
Tell me, who was the suspect?

113
00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:21,068
Pick up my shoe for me.

114
00:10:23,443 --> 00:10:25,734
Who was the suspect?

115
00:10:25,818 --> 00:10:28,151
I was the suspect.

116
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:30,401
I'm the one you followed
to find that fat guy.

117
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:31,984
I solved the case, right?

118
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:33,234
Yes... No.

119
00:10:33,317 --> 00:10:34,192
I solved the case.

120
00:10:34,276 --> 00:10:35,234
Because I'm smart.

121
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:37,067
I'm smart in knowing you're smart.

122
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:38,234
Cut that crap.

123
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:39,651
How about the reward?

124
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:41,442
You called OCTB at 7:40 p.m.

125
00:10:41,651 --> 00:10:43,317
But I issued my order at 7:30 p.m.

126
00:10:43,484 --> 00:10:45,234
We took action
before you reported the case

127
00:10:45,317 --> 00:10:47,192
Also, you didn't give any details
on the phone,

128
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:48,275
except for your name.

129
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,150
You fucked up everything.

130
00:10:53,692 --> 00:10:54,817
- Don't do that.
- It hurts.

131
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:56,150
Sorry.

132
00:10:56,317 --> 00:10:57,484
My juniors are all looking.

133
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,192
I spent nine months in Mongkok.

134
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,275
It all came down to nothing.

135
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:02,900
You'll get a good citizen award.

136
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:04,608
Award, your ass!

137
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:07,317
You police officers with three stars
are being paid 80,000 dollars a month.

138
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
But we, disabled people,

139
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:10,483
make a living only on these rewards.

140
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:11,608
I'm over here.

141
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:13,525
I'll treat you.

142
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:15,442
I'll treat you
with some red wine and good food.

143
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:16,442
Let's go.

144
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:18,025
It should be worth at least 100,000.

145
00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:19,233
Worth at least 100,000 dollars?

146
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:21,400
I'm earning only 80,000 dollars per month.

147
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:22,608
I have to feed my family.

148
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:23,525
I don't care.

149
00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:25,150
I need to eat 100,000 dollars
worth of food.

150
00:11:26,108 --> 00:11:27,608
My treat. Call it a celebration.

151
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:28,608
What?

152
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:58,482
Coming.

153
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,149
How are you, Johnston?

154
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:05,399
I'm Ho.

155
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:11,399
Thank you.

156
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,274
- Put it here.
- Sure.

157
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,982
Are you driving later? Give me your glass.

158
00:12:36,065 --> 00:12:37,690
There are very few female cops
as good as you.

159
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:39,273
You got good training?

160
00:12:39,356 --> 00:12:41,148
Yes. I was stationed at the airport.

161
00:12:50,898 --> 00:12:52,023
Do you run fast?

162
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:54,231
My record is 2.4km
in 9 minutes and 17 minutes.

163
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:04,647
How about shooting and combat?

164
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:07,147
I'm good.
I trained in close quarters combat.

165
00:13:15,397 --> 00:13:17,522
Why do you have
to put down your silverware when you talk?

166
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:23,814
I'm actually a bit scared of you.

167
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:28,605
I'm no good at all with investigations.

168
00:13:28,689 --> 00:13:30,397
I lack a detective's mind.

169
00:13:30,814 --> 00:13:32,938
That's why I'm envious of my colleagues.

170
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,730
They would only need to think
for a minute,

171
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,313
then they solve a case instantly.

172
00:13:36,938 --> 00:13:38,980
You're absolutely brilliant

173
00:13:39,147 --> 00:13:42,105
despite being blind.

174
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,772
I admire you so much.

175
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:45,147
You're really my idol.

176
00:13:45,897 --> 00:13:47,688
I secretly called you

177
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:48,813
the God of Cracking Cases.

178
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:00,063
Very agile.

179
00:14:03,271 --> 00:14:04,229
One more bottle.

180
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:19,146
Do you live here?

181
00:14:20,979 --> 00:14:22,521
Nice neighborhood.

182
00:14:23,354 --> 00:14:24,646
It's quiet.

183
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:25,646
Over there.

184
00:14:25,854 --> 00:14:27,271
The first one across the street.

185
00:14:28,937 --> 00:14:30,770
Are you okay?

186
00:14:32,895 --> 00:14:36,020
Yes. I'm completely sober.

187
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,187
Tell me about the case.

188
00:14:42,437 --> 00:14:43,729
Minnie is my junior.

189
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:45,853
Three years younger than me,
she was in Grade 7 back then.

190
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,937
She was living with her a foster family.

191
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,312
She's a bit weird.

192
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,395
She has self-esteem.
She's unsociable and friendless.

193
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,978
The boys always bullied her in school.

194
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,145
I'd always defend her.

195
00:15:00,228 --> 00:15:02,270
Maybe that's why we became good friends.

196
00:15:03,395 --> 00:15:05,603
She used to follow me home after school.

197
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:11,311
We did our homework together,
played together, ate junk food together.

198
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,644
Get to the point.

199
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:18,853
One day,

200
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:21,603
she told me in tears

201
00:15:21,894 --> 00:15:24,478
that she was afraid she'd be like

202
00:15:24,644 --> 00:15:26,811
her grandma and mom who killed for love.

203
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:29,644
Turned out her father
had an affair shortly after her birth.

204
00:15:29,894 --> 00:15:31,519
Her mother was so angry,

205
00:15:31,602 --> 00:15:33,394
that she murdered him

206
00:15:33,477 --> 00:15:35,686
and preserved his body in salt.

207
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,019
She was raised by her grandma.

208
00:15:39,227 --> 00:15:41,936
When she was in elementary school,
her grandma became some guy's mistress.

209
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:43,061
The guy was a creep.

210
00:15:43,144 --> 00:15:44,436
He refused to divorce his wife

211
00:15:44,727 --> 00:15:45,894
and dumped her grandma.

212
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:48,644
Since she was infuriated,
her grandma murdered the guy.

213
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:50,602
She even deep-fried his body.

214
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,477
So, you were shocked when you found out

215
00:15:57,102 --> 00:15:58,435
and distanced yourself from Minnie?

216
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:01,768
It's only natural.

217
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:03,810
I avoided her.

218
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:07,935
But she came and waited for me
at that spot.

219
00:16:08,393 --> 00:16:10,477
She waited for the whole night.

220
00:16:10,643 --> 00:16:12,143
I was absolutely horrified.

221
00:16:12,227 --> 00:16:13,560
I hid behind the window.

222
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,851
Thinking back,

223
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:20,768
she must have been heartbroken.

224
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:23,351
But I was really scared,

225
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:25,393
I didn't dare to come down.

226
00:16:25,476 --> 00:16:26,726
I never did.

227
00:16:29,185 --> 00:16:30,643
After standing there for five nights,

228
00:16:31,684 --> 00:16:35,101
on June 20,

229
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:37,476
she disappeared.

230
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:29,975
She was just a little girl.

231
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:31,391
Where could she have gone?

232
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:33,683
She's been missing for over a decade.

233
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,641
The truth can be very harsh.

234
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,141
Are you sure you want to find out?

235
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,183
Yes. I want to look for her.

236
00:17:41,266 --> 00:17:42,308
No problem.

237
00:17:42,683 --> 00:17:44,391
Give me 500,000 dollars.

238
00:17:45,683 --> 00:17:46,516
The plastic bag.

239
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,808
Here you are.

240
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,807
Where's the toilet?

241
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:27,307
Shit, does this place have to be this big?

242
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:34,640
- What are you doing?
- I want to pee.

243
00:18:34,723 --> 00:18:36,515
- I'm taking a bath!
- Where's the toilet?

244
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:38,682
- Toilet! Where is it?
- I'm taking a bath!

245
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:40,057
There's a toilet in your room.

246
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,140
Tell me where it is.

247
00:18:41,223 --> 00:18:42,057
Over there.

248
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,306
- Which direction?
- Your nine o'clock.

249
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,431
Relax.

250
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:00,598
I'm blind. I can't see a thing.

251
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,973
I'm not blind though.

252
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:03,681
Don't look.

253
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:05,931
Why am I here?

254
00:19:06,098 --> 00:19:07,473
You were drunk last night.

255
00:19:07,598 --> 00:19:08,889
I brought you here.

256
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:18,431
Thank you.

257
00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:23,722
Are you totally blind?

258
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:24,972
Yes. Pitch black.

259
00:19:27,139 --> 00:19:28,264
I can't see a thing?

260
00:19:57,138 --> 00:19:58,513
It's 3,000 square feet?

261
00:19:59,305 --> 00:20:00,180
No, 3,600.

262
00:20:01,805 --> 00:20:02,805
On what street?

263
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,596
Durham Road.

264
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:07,805
Kowloon Tong, low-density housing.

265
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,680
It must have cost
more than 20,000 per square foot.

266
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:13,013
About 70 million dollars?

267
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:14,221
Do you accept bribes?

268
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,304
What do you mean?

269
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:16,763
I inherited the money from my parents.

270
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:18,346
I'm the only member in the family now.

271
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:19,763
My dowry is secured.

272
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:28,971
You'll help find Minnie for me, won't you?

273
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:30,512
Yes.

274
00:20:34,304 --> 00:20:35,179
But it will be expensive.

275
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:37,637
One million dollars.

276
00:20:39,096 --> 00:20:41,762
- I thought you said 500,000 dollars.
- Are you kidding? No way!

277
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:46,845
I'm the God of Cracking Cases.

278
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:49,137
- Do you have any problem?
- No.

279
00:20:50,595 --> 00:20:51,512
Apply for your leave.

280
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:53,970
Why would I do that?

281
00:20:54,137 --> 00:20:55,679
You can learn from me.

282
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,178
I'll teach you a few clever tricks.

283
00:20:57,262 --> 00:20:58,512
Free of charge.

284
00:20:59,553 --> 00:21:01,678
- Thank you, thank you.
- My pleasure.

285
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,220
Listen to this case.

286
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:05,803
<i>Homicide case.</i>

287
00:21:05,887 --> 00:21:07,887
<i>April 17, 1992.</i>

288
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,053
<i>Wednesday night.</i>

289
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:10,262
<i>Kowloon public morgue.</i>

290
00:21:28,178 --> 00:21:29,011
Police!

291
00:21:39,261 --> 00:21:40,886
You'll be Kau. I'll be Tak.

292
00:21:41,011 --> 00:21:42,552
- Tell me I'm stupid.
- How?

293
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:43,927
Brainless! Moron!

294
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:47,469
Use your imagination.

295
00:21:49,802 --> 00:21:52,719
Brainless! Moron!

296
00:21:53,552 --> 00:21:56,469
Brainless! Moron!

297
00:21:56,844 --> 00:21:58,719
- Brainless!
- Do you think with your ass?

298
00:21:58,927 --> 00:22:00,177
Pig!

299
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,969
Do you think with your ass? Pig!

300
00:22:05,052 --> 00:22:06,844
Again, fiercer.

301
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:10,260
Dickhead!

302
00:22:10,343 --> 00:22:11,260
Pig!

303
00:22:11,343 --> 00:22:13,343
Kau is from Chiuchow. Use the dialect.

304
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,802
Dickhead!

305
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:20,010
Pig!

306
00:22:20,093 --> 00:22:21,718
You know nothing!

307
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:23,427
You aren't human!

308
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,551
You're as stupid as a pig!

309
00:22:25,676 --> 00:22:27,010
You know nothing!

310
00:22:27,176 --> 00:22:28,468
Dickhead!

311
00:22:28,551 --> 00:22:30,635
Moron! Have you left your brain at home?

312
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:33,051
I've told you. You imbecile!

313
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:35,385
Let me tell you, you're worse than a pig!

314
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:36,926
As stupid as a pig!

315
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,510
Your brain is full of shit!

316
00:22:38,593 --> 00:22:40,259
Asshole, have you finished?

317
00:22:42,343 --> 00:22:43,176
What?

318
00:22:47,468 --> 00:22:48,634
It doesn't break.

319
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:51,884
I'll throw it harder.

320
00:22:52,134 --> 00:22:52,968
Let's swap roles.

321
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:54,801
I'll play Tak, and you'll play Kau.

322
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:00,634
Asshole, have you finished?

323
00:23:01,717 --> 00:23:02,551
What happened?

324
00:23:02,634 --> 00:23:03,717
It didn't break.

325
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:04,676
Forget it.

326
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:05,842
Let's start again.

327
00:23:11,217 --> 00:23:12,842
Asshole, have you finished?

328
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,717
Did you bring your brain to work?

329
00:23:28,883 --> 00:23:29,967
Wait!

330
00:23:31,425 --> 00:23:32,258
Wait a second.

331
00:23:32,717 --> 00:23:35,633
A person like you who has learned
martial arts won't be able to do it.

332
00:23:37,758 --> 00:23:38,675
Let's swap.

333
00:23:39,466 --> 00:23:40,550
But you can't see.

334
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:42,383
It's okay. I'll manage.

335
00:23:56,341 --> 00:23:59,466
Crawl! Hurry!

336
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:05,258
Faster!

337
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:12,049
Tak is coming from behind,
like someone insane.

338
00:24:12,132 --> 00:24:13,174
He hit him nine times.

339
00:24:13,257 --> 00:24:14,341
One, two...

340
00:24:17,132 --> 00:24:18,424
Stop!

341
00:24:21,132 --> 00:24:23,091
Kau was seriously injured.

342
00:24:23,216 --> 00:24:24,924
He couldn't have crawled so fast.

343
00:24:25,424 --> 00:24:28,799
Back to the original position.
Act slowly this time.

344
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:30,132
You're badly injured.

345
00:24:32,632 --> 00:24:33,715
You're doomed.

346
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:43,090
Keep crawling.

347
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,507
You're a piece of dead meat now.

348
00:24:50,298 --> 00:24:52,215
Stop!

349
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:53,173
What?

350
00:24:53,382 --> 00:24:56,131
You're inconsistent.
You were mad just a while ago.

351
00:24:56,215 --> 00:24:59,048
Why are you acting like that now?

352
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:01,131
It's not right for you to strike him,

353
00:25:01,465 --> 00:25:02,381
and then waited

354
00:25:02,756 --> 00:25:04,381
before you hit him
nine more times outside.

355
00:25:04,756 --> 00:25:06,006
What happened in between?

356
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,256
The delivery man came?

357
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:12,048
Who ordered from us?

358
00:25:15,673 --> 00:25:16,589
Diarrhea?

359
00:25:23,464 --> 00:25:25,547
What's more urgent than killing a person?

360
00:25:31,131 --> 00:25:32,256
To kill another person.

361
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:34,297
There's a third person.

362
00:25:35,256 --> 00:25:37,131
A third person entered the scene

363
00:25:37,214 --> 00:25:38,255
after Tak had hit Kau once.

364
00:25:38,589 --> 00:25:39,964
Tak had to leave Kau behind

365
00:25:40,047 --> 00:25:41,339
and chase after that third person.

366
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:44,255
I need a third person.

367
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:45,214
Here!

368
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:46,922
Let me play him.

369
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,047
Wait, no!

370
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,589
The police didn't find
any other bloodstain at the crime scene.

371
00:25:52,047 --> 00:25:54,963
Tak didn't kill with a hammer.

372
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:01,422
The victim was strangled to death.

373
00:26:01,588 --> 00:26:02,797
The timing fits.

374
00:26:03,255 --> 00:26:04,338
Get one of them to play Kau.

375
00:26:04,422 --> 00:26:05,255
- Me.
- Me.

376
00:26:05,338 --> 00:26:06,797
- You! You raised your hand first.
- Yes.

377
00:26:10,463 --> 00:26:13,463
When I start strangling, start crawling.

378
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,713
Can I struggle?

379
00:26:19,796 --> 00:26:21,463
Of course. That's normal.

380
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,088
It hurts!

381
00:26:23,463 --> 00:26:24,754
Ouch!

382
00:26:26,171 --> 00:26:27,379
You can't strangle me like this.

383
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:28,463
Let's swap.

384
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:29,463
I'm blind!

385
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,421
All right!

386
00:26:30,504 --> 00:26:31,629
Again?

387
00:26:31,796 --> 00:26:32,838
Yes.

388
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:34,296
I'm blind!

389
00:26:34,421 --> 00:26:35,963
I know. One, two, three.

390
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:50,004
Sorry. I played it for real.

391
00:26:51,837 --> 00:26:54,462
After him!

392
00:27:02,045 --> 00:27:06,420
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine!

393
00:27:06,504 --> 00:27:07,337
Dead!

394
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,212
The time matches!

395
00:27:11,045 --> 00:27:12,087
Johnston?

396
00:27:22,295 --> 00:27:23,920
Who's the one being strangled?

397
00:27:26,503 --> 00:27:27,836
The police didn't find his body.

398
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:29,920
That means you've disposed of it.

399
00:27:30,753 --> 00:27:31,920
Why did you dispose of this guy

400
00:27:32,045 --> 00:27:33,128
but not him?

401
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:39,586
Where have you been
in the last two decades?

402
00:27:56,252 --> 00:27:58,419
Higher. Ready? Drop it.

403
00:28:05,877 --> 00:28:07,669
Right. That's the way it was smashed.

404
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:10,169
But why smash the TV?

405
00:28:10,294 --> 00:28:11,627
What triggered such behavior?

406
00:28:19,835 --> 00:28:25,210
What program was aired on
Wednesday nights 20 years ago?

407
00:28:26,002 --> 00:28:27,043
<i>Enjoy Yourself Tonight.</i>

408
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:28,877
What about in other channels?

409
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,752
Live broadcast of horse-racing.

410
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:31,752
I understand now!

411
00:28:33,127 --> 00:28:34,252
I completely understand.

412
00:28:36,876 --> 00:28:38,793
Let's go and eat.

413
00:28:40,376 --> 00:28:41,751
We won't need these. Thank you.

414
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:53,126
- Here's the change, two dollars.
- Thanks.

415
00:28:59,084 --> 00:29:00,334
Two bowls of noodles.

416
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:04,293
Long time no see. I thought you were dead.

417
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:05,834
{\an8}KEI KEE

418
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:09,084
This is super delicious.

419
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:11,751
I used to come here with Szeto.

420
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:17,459
Do you see

421
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:19,751
that there is a dance studio
on the second floor behind you?

422
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,417
Do you see it?

423
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,084
Yes. Tango Blue, right?

424
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,250
Go check if she's there.

425
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,917
- Go.
- What's the case about?

426
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,625
A big case. Go.

427
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:35,583
Okay.

428
00:29:35,708 --> 00:29:37,417
- Don't fuck it up.
- Yes.

429
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:46,875
She's coming down.

430
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Who?

431
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:50,875
The lady, what shall we do?

432
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:55,875
Don't look. Pretend to eat.

433
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:02,166
Calm down.

434
00:30:06,291 --> 00:30:10,124
Seems like you're the nervous one.
Who's she?

435
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:11,416
A wanted criminal?

436
00:30:52,123 --> 00:30:55,248
She's getting in a cab.
Shall we follow her?

437
00:30:56,623 --> 00:30:57,623
Johnston?

438
00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:01,290
No need. Mission accomplished.

439
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,165
Two more bowls for takeaway, please.

440
00:31:05,248 --> 00:31:06,081
Okay.

441
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:17,123
Hey, take off your shoes.

442
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:18,581
I just washed the floor.

443
00:31:24,623 --> 00:31:25,498
What's up?

444
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:26,831
Why are you so excited?

445
00:31:27,456 --> 00:31:29,039
She's back.

446
00:31:30,831 --> 00:31:32,123
Who?

447
00:31:43,122 --> 00:31:46,581
This is nice, who are you talking about?

448
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:48,414
What are you eating?

449
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,247
Gizzard.

450
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,664
What dance am I dancing?

451
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:54,705
Tango.

452
00:32:01,622 --> 00:32:02,580
Your future wife?

453
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:05,080
Right. My future wife.

454
00:32:05,163 --> 00:32:06,163
Don't you remember?

455
00:32:06,663 --> 00:32:08,163
You helped me find her back then.

456
00:32:08,247 --> 00:32:09,288
But she went away.

457
00:32:09,955 --> 00:32:12,497
I've never thought
I'd run into her four years later.

458
00:32:12,622 --> 00:32:15,372
I'm destined to marry her.

459
00:32:18,122 --> 00:32:19,288
Have you ever thought

460
00:32:19,663 --> 00:32:21,538
your future wife might have married?

461
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,746
You have a foul mouth.

462
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,163
She's probably someone else's wife.

463
00:32:26,413 --> 00:32:27,955
It's been a long time,
and she's 30 already.

464
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:30,705
It's perfectly normal to get married.

465
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:32,163
A beautiful woman like her

466
00:32:32,246 --> 00:32:34,829
must have a lot of suitors.

467
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,871
Right.

468
00:32:38,954 --> 00:32:41,204
Harder!

469
00:32:41,288 --> 00:32:42,996
Okay!

470
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,662
It's all mold and rot.

471
00:32:56,162 --> 00:32:58,912
One can't live here anymore.

472
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,537
I'm not used to work outside of my house.

473
00:33:01,621 --> 00:33:04,412
But this is a complicated case.

474
00:33:04,662 --> 00:33:06,120
I need to move out and feel things.

475
00:33:06,704 --> 00:33:07,787
No additional charge.

476
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,662
Sure. Thanks a lot.

477
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:11,037
My pleasure.

478
00:33:13,245 --> 00:33:14,329
Where's my room?

479
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:21,828
What do you think, Johnston?
Is everything okay?

480
00:33:22,287 --> 00:33:24,370
It will do.

481
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,995
I'd like my wardrobe
to be set up just like the way at home.

482
00:33:27,578 --> 00:33:30,412
Suits on the left and shirts on the right.

483
00:33:30,703 --> 00:33:32,953
Casual wear and pajamas in the bottom.

484
00:33:52,328 --> 00:33:56,369
Let's watch TV together, Goldie.

485
00:34:22,285 --> 00:34:23,202
Johnston?

486
00:34:24,202 --> 00:34:26,077
- Johnston.
- I'm thinking about something.

487
00:34:32,993 --> 00:34:34,410
You were looking at Minnie from here?

488
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:39,285
She was standing across the street.

489
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,410
Go down and shout to me.
I'd like to experience it.

490
00:34:42,202 --> 00:34:43,160
Okay.

491
00:34:53,368 --> 00:34:56,160
Johnston! I'm here!

492
00:34:56,785 --> 00:34:57,701
Good.

493
00:35:05,118 --> 00:35:05,993
Hello?

494
00:35:06,576 --> 00:35:07,826
Did Minnie behave strangely

495
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:09,451
while she was waiting for you?

496
00:35:10,034 --> 00:35:12,243
She came here right after school.

497
00:35:12,451 --> 00:35:14,076
She did that for several nights.

498
00:35:14,743 --> 00:35:16,326
But I remember that on the last night,

499
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:19,909
she was raising her hand at me.

500
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:21,576
I didn't know what that meant.

501
00:35:21,826 --> 00:35:22,742
She slit her wrist.

502
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:27,659
She wanted me
to know she was very unhappy.

503
00:35:28,784 --> 00:35:30,367
Why didn't I realize that?

504
00:35:30,742 --> 00:35:32,575
And yet you knew right away.

505
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,992
I'm blind, but I can read people's mind.

506
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,075
Why are you blind?

507
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,367
I was on a case

508
00:35:41,617 --> 00:35:42,659
four years ago,

509
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:45,409
I was waiting for the suspect
to show his face.

510
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,533
I started to see dark patches

511
00:35:47,825 --> 00:35:48,908
on the seventh day.

512
00:35:49,492 --> 00:35:53,075
But I didn't pay any attention to that
since I wanted to solve the case.

513
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,617
The next day, the suspect showed up

514
00:35:55,992 --> 00:35:58,575
I chased frantically after him
until I caught him.

515
00:35:59,867 --> 00:36:03,741
But I became blind after that.

516
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,616
The doctor said it's retinal detachment,

517
00:36:07,408 --> 00:36:09,741
and it's too late.

518
00:36:24,116 --> 00:36:25,449
Which one is Minnie?

519
00:36:29,658 --> 00:36:33,741
Check whose feet will fit the sneaker.

520
00:36:35,532 --> 00:36:37,491
Minnie's feet have grown so much?

521
00:36:37,657 --> 00:36:39,157
I gave her a pair of red shoes.

522
00:36:44,532 --> 00:36:46,699
This is the police. Line up.

523
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:49,324
Take off your shoes, one by one.

524
00:36:50,532 --> 00:36:51,574
Left foot, please.

525
00:37:02,865 --> 00:37:03,782
What's up?

526
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,198
Coach, it's the police.

527
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:07,157
We're on a case. Step aside.

528
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,490
What's wrong? What happened?

529
00:37:23,573 --> 00:37:24,781
The coach ran away.

530
00:37:25,156 --> 00:37:27,281
Chase after her.

531
00:37:27,365 --> 00:37:28,448
- Okay!
- After her.

532
00:37:32,114 --> 00:37:34,156
Bingo. I can't believe it.

533
00:37:35,614 --> 00:37:38,364
Take a break. More policemen are coming.

534
00:37:42,614 --> 00:37:43,448
<i>Hello?</i>

535
00:37:43,573 --> 00:37:45,906
I told you, Szeto.

536
00:37:46,156 --> 00:37:48,822
That big-foot who robbed
five jewelry shops in a row

537
00:37:51,156 --> 00:37:54,364
three years ago is a woman.

538
00:37:54,447 --> 00:37:55,614
Come quickly.

539
00:37:55,697 --> 00:37:58,239
Minnie!

540
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:14,405
Are you okay, miss?

541
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,072
Minnie!

542
00:38:25,322 --> 00:38:26,988
Minnie!

543
00:38:36,571 --> 00:38:38,946
I lost her. I only picked up a shoe.

544
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:42,821
Why do you give it to me?

545
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:46,154
I thought you're a sprinter?

546
00:38:46,321 --> 00:38:47,863
She was much taller than me.

547
00:38:47,946 --> 00:38:51,071
She doubled my strides.
I even broke my heels.

548
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:53,154
Why didn't you shoot her?

549
00:38:53,363 --> 00:38:54,696
You also mentioned your marksmanship.

550
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:56,863
I can't shoot at Minnie.

551
00:38:59,612 --> 00:39:00,821
She's not Minnie?

552
00:39:00,904 --> 00:39:02,071
Nobody said she was!

553
00:39:02,779 --> 00:39:03,904
You assumed by yourself!

554
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:06,321
I'm Chief Inspector Szeto Fatbo.

555
00:39:06,654 --> 00:39:08,112
Where's the suspect?

556
00:39:08,196 --> 00:39:09,487
Gone.

557
00:39:09,571 --> 00:39:12,946
Go check him out. Get a police dog.

558
00:39:13,029 --> 00:39:14,529
Send someone.

559
00:39:15,737 --> 00:39:17,362
We're talking
about the one-million bounty.

560
00:39:20,029 --> 00:39:21,195
Johnston.

561
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,862
You're actually investigating
your own case.

562
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:25,112
You're not looking for Minnie.

563
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,779
Well, I'm doing both.

564
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,737
You cheated me
to help you get your bounty.

565
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,653
What do you mean by cheating you?

566
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:32,653
Who do you think I am?

567
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:33,862
Who do you think Johnston is?

568
00:39:33,945 --> 00:39:34,862
I'm cheating you?

569
00:39:34,945 --> 00:39:36,903
- Come on, her feet are all swollen.
- How do I cheat you?

570
00:39:36,987 --> 00:39:37,820
What do you mean?

571
00:39:37,903 --> 00:39:39,862
I'm teaching you to be a good cop
and help you improve.

572
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:42,570
What did you say?

573
00:39:46,986 --> 00:39:48,445
They're like roasted pig knuckles.

574
00:40:11,486 --> 00:40:13,861
My parents didn't want me to be a cop.

575
00:40:14,777 --> 00:40:15,944
But I didn't care.

576
00:40:16,819 --> 00:40:18,652
Because I really wanted to find Minnie.

577
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:22,527
I felt I was responsible

578
00:40:23,777 --> 00:40:25,652
for her disappearance.

579
00:40:28,194 --> 00:40:29,485
I've applied for a ten-day leave.

580
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:31,985
I still have a week left.

581
00:41:40,484 --> 00:41:41,526
You're a madcap, aren't you?

582
00:41:42,775 --> 00:41:45,859
I was raised in a broken family.

583
00:41:47,484 --> 00:41:48,817
<i>Is Minnie's mother still in jail?</i>

584
00:41:49,234 --> 00:41:50,275
<i>She killed herself in prison.</i>

585
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:51,567
<i>How about her grandma?</i>

586
00:41:51,817 --> 00:41:53,067
<i>She was released a few years ago.</i>

587
00:41:53,234 --> 00:41:55,150
<i>I asked her about Minnie.
She's doesn't know anything.</i>

588
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,359
<i>Bring me to her.</i>

589
00:42:02,942 --> 00:42:04,525
Watch out!

590
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,650
Granny!

591
00:42:09,858 --> 00:42:11,067
I'm Ho.

592
00:42:11,192 --> 00:42:12,233
Are you there?

593
00:42:13,525 --> 00:42:14,816
- Excuse me.
- I don't know.

594
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,525
I don't know her.

595
00:42:18,566 --> 00:42:19,733
I never saw her.

596
00:42:21,525 --> 00:42:22,483
Don't ask me.

597
00:42:25,275 --> 00:42:26,191
Call her.

598
00:43:08,024 --> 00:43:09,190
Granny is here.

599
00:43:10,024 --> 00:43:11,232
The perfume is intoxicating.

600
00:43:12,273 --> 00:43:14,690
Pang.

601
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:17,815
Come out!

602
00:43:18,607 --> 00:43:22,315
Come out, you nymph.

603
00:43:23,815 --> 00:43:27,190
You can't desert me like that.

604
00:43:27,273 --> 00:43:29,065
I helped you change the light bulb
out of kindness.

605
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,773
But it turned out
I have to run for my life

606
00:43:30,856 --> 00:43:31,981
I don't like you at all.

607
00:43:32,065 --> 00:43:35,690
But I like you.
I've fallen in love with you.

608
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:38,023
For God's sake.

609
00:43:38,106 --> 00:43:39,898
Leave him alone.

610
00:43:40,648 --> 00:43:42,773
- Leave my father alone.
- Leave my father alone.

611
00:43:42,939 --> 00:43:44,564
Leave my father-in-law alone.

612
00:43:44,731 --> 00:43:46,356
Shut up!

613
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:49,023
Pang, my love for you is true.

614
00:43:49,106 --> 00:43:50,481
But you've treated me like trash.

615
00:43:50,856 --> 00:43:53,564
You've dumped me.
I'll make your life miserable.

616
00:43:54,731 --> 00:43:57,356
You're out of your mind.

617
00:44:00,522 --> 00:44:01,522
Run!

618
00:44:02,731 --> 00:44:05,397
- Let's go!
- Don't look!

619
00:44:06,022 --> 00:44:07,397
Close the door.

620
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,647
I won't let go of you.

621
00:44:15,814 --> 00:44:17,147
Granny went to the stairs at the back.

622
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,772
- Go after her.
- I'm on it.

623
00:44:22,897 --> 00:44:25,980
Help to put everything onto the truck.

624
00:44:28,355 --> 00:44:30,522
Forget everything. Leave them behind.

625
00:44:30,605 --> 00:44:32,522
Let's get into the truck.

626
00:44:32,647 --> 00:44:33,730
Let's go!

627
00:44:33,813 --> 00:44:34,647
Where is she?

628
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:35,897
This way.

629
00:44:37,813 --> 00:44:42,105
Pang, wait for me!

630
00:44:43,146 --> 00:44:47,063
Wait for me!

631
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:49,063
Pang!

632
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,021
Hey!

633
00:44:53,521 --> 00:44:54,771
Granny is getting a taxi.

634
00:44:54,979 --> 00:44:55,938
Follow her.

635
00:44:56,063 --> 00:44:59,771
- Hurry!
- Taxi! After the truck!

636
00:45:00,396 --> 00:45:02,688
Let's go. Hurry!

637
00:45:02,979 --> 00:45:09,979
- Hurry, follow the truck.
- Come here

638
00:45:11,521 --> 00:45:14,354
Go after it!

639
00:45:14,437 --> 00:45:16,562
Hurry!

640
00:45:16,646 --> 00:45:18,646
I can't live without him.

641
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:21,271
Granny, this is Johnston.
He's looking for Minnie.

642
00:45:21,354 --> 00:45:22,812
We have some questions for you.

643
00:45:23,354 --> 00:45:24,854
I know nothing.

644
00:45:24,937 --> 00:45:26,437
Leave me alone.

645
00:45:26,854 --> 00:45:28,979
- Hurry! Drive faster.
- Granny.

646
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:31,479
Minnie is your granddaughter.

647
00:45:32,395 --> 00:45:36,479
She has nothing to do with me,
dead or alive.

648
00:45:37,395 --> 00:45:41,020
Leave me alone, or you'll be sorry.

649
00:45:41,145 --> 00:45:42,770
I can be vicious.

650
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,228
Hurry!

651
00:45:46,562 --> 00:45:47,853
<i>This woman is intoxicated with love.</i>

652
00:45:47,937 --> 00:45:48,937
Leave her alone.

653
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,395
It will expire very soon.

654
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,437
What?

655
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,728
The reward money.

656
00:45:52,812 --> 00:45:54,686
Even if I solve the case,
I won't get paid.

657
00:46:17,019 --> 00:46:19,019
Granny got in the truck.

658
00:46:21,561 --> 00:46:22,936
She hid in the closet.

659
00:46:23,936 --> 00:46:26,936
What should we do?

660
00:46:28,811 --> 00:46:29,811
We'll go to Macau.

661
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,144
Is eight points a sure win?

662
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:47,144
There's no sure win in gambling.

663
00:46:47,602 --> 00:46:50,310
Give me a three-line.

664
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,643
Three-lines.

665
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:54,852
Come on.

666
00:46:54,935 --> 00:47:00,268
Come on.

667
00:47:12,976 --> 00:47:14,435
Are you making a fool of me, Szeto?

668
00:47:15,185 --> 00:47:16,560
I've checked all the casinos.

669
00:47:16,643 --> 00:47:18,351
Are you sure he's in Macau?

670
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:19,476
Please take the bill.

671
00:47:20,185 --> 00:47:21,976
Cut the crap. It's all your fault.

672
00:47:22,851 --> 00:47:24,934
The reward money
for the morgue murder will soon expire.

673
00:47:25,018 --> 00:47:26,018
Extend it for me.

674
00:47:26,934 --> 00:47:29,018
I don't care how you will do that.

675
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:32,309
You came here
on the pretext of Minnie's case.

676
00:47:32,643 --> 00:47:34,726
But you're actually working
on your own case.

677
00:47:35,268 --> 00:47:37,309
You never wanted to help me.

678
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:41,059
Minnie is human.

679
00:47:41,642 --> 00:47:43,517
She has a human life.

680
00:47:44,351 --> 00:47:45,476
How about the other victims?

681
00:47:46,267 --> 00:47:49,434
How about Kau? Are they humans?

682
00:47:49,517 --> 00:47:50,934
Do they have human lives?

683
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:53,267
What kind of cop are you?

684
00:47:59,434 --> 00:48:02,392
After I went blind, I kept thinking.

685
00:48:03,517 --> 00:48:06,517
Why on earth did God make me blind?

686
00:48:08,433 --> 00:48:09,600
Then I understood.

687
00:48:10,933 --> 00:48:12,017
I became blind

688
00:48:12,225 --> 00:48:14,183
to look into old cases
which no one cares about,

689
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,392
go after those murderers
who have evaded the police,

690
00:48:20,017 --> 00:48:22,891
and bring justice to the victims.

691
00:48:29,516 --> 00:48:30,766
Sorry about that, Johnston.

692
00:48:30,891 --> 00:48:34,475
It's fine, as long as you understand.
Let's find him.

693
00:48:35,183 --> 00:48:36,058
I've got him.

694
00:48:36,141 --> 00:48:38,474
Where? Why didn't you tell me?

695
00:48:38,558 --> 00:48:39,933
He's playing baccarat.

696
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:42,474
The one who just sneezed.

697
00:48:45,474 --> 00:48:46,433
He's leaving.

698
00:48:46,516 --> 00:48:47,724
Follow him.

699
00:48:48,433 --> 00:48:49,433
Hurry!

700
00:48:51,891 --> 00:48:54,432
Wasn't Tak the murderer
in the morgue case?

701
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,932
How is this fat guy involved?

702
00:49:00,224 --> 00:49:01,557
Don't tell me he is Tak.

703
00:49:01,641 --> 00:49:03,516
He has gained that much weight?

704
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,266
Do you want
to be the Goddess of Cracking Cases?

705
00:49:07,474 --> 00:49:08,432
Yes.

706
00:49:10,099 --> 00:49:13,140
To solve a case,
one must have an imaginative mind.

707
00:49:13,807 --> 00:49:15,307
You must learn to be creative.

708
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:18,849
Brodmann Areas 37, 39, 40
of the cerebral cortex.

709
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:20,807
What areas? Where are they?

710
00:49:21,973 --> 00:49:24,307
Here, here, and here.

711
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,015
Here, here, and here?

712
00:49:29,223 --> 00:49:30,390
Close your eyes.

713
00:49:30,473 --> 00:49:31,307
Done.

714
00:49:31,765 --> 00:49:32,723
Where are you?

715
00:49:32,807 --> 00:49:33,723
In a restaurant.

716
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:36,140
Do you want me to beat you up?

717
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,015
Imagine yourself

718
00:49:39,265 --> 00:49:41,431
in the office of the morgue.

719
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:45,848
The date is Wednesday, April 17, 1992.

720
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:49,598
There's a live broadcast
of the last horse race on TV.

721
00:49:49,931 --> 00:49:52,223
The commentator is very good.

722
00:49:52,514 --> 00:49:53,931
Heading in the final round

723
00:49:54,098 --> 00:49:58,514
is Warlord, followed closely
by More Treasures.

724
00:50:00,139 --> 00:50:02,806
<i>Kau and Tak betted on a six-up jackpot.</i>

725
00:50:02,889 --> 00:50:04,139
<i>They had won five races in a row.</i>

726
00:50:04,264 --> 00:50:05,556
<i>This was the decisive one.</i>

727
00:50:05,972 --> 00:50:08,389
But there was a third person at the scene.

728
00:50:08,931 --> 00:50:09,847
Who?

729
00:50:10,597 --> 00:50:11,681
Imagine it was yourself.

730
00:50:13,722 --> 00:50:16,514
Number eight, hang on.

731
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,889
You used to chip in on their bets.

732
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:21,055
But not this time.

733
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,305
Damn! Every time I chipped in, you'd lose.

734
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,097
When I didn't, you'd win.

735
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,014
Well, this proves that you have bad luck.

736
00:50:29,097 --> 00:50:30,139
Why complain?

737
00:50:30,222 --> 00:50:31,930
We had asked you to chip in, jerk.

738
00:50:32,014 --> 00:50:33,555
<i>The six-up jackpot is a record-breaking</i>

739
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:35,472
<i>5,209,010 dollars.</i>

740
00:50:35,805 --> 00:50:37,805
What a big prize. Yes!
Over two million for each of us.

741
00:50:37,888 --> 00:50:39,430
Kau, we can quit our job.

742
00:50:44,805 --> 00:50:47,680
You simply couldn't accept it.

743
00:50:48,513 --> 00:50:52,680
You were overwhelmed with anger.

744
00:51:32,804 --> 00:51:35,887
I see. Tak was the victim, not the killer.

745
00:51:37,137 --> 00:51:41,429
He's Lee Tak Shing,
a day-shift colleague of Tak and Kau.

746
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:44,720
After Kau's death
and the disappearance of Tak,

747
00:51:44,929 --> 00:51:47,845
Lee collected the five-million jackpot

748
00:51:47,929 --> 00:51:48,845
from Jockey Club

749
00:51:49,137 --> 00:51:50,845
and started his own business.

750
00:51:51,553 --> 00:51:54,178
But he soon lost all of the money.

751
00:51:54,512 --> 00:51:57,678
Once a murderer, he wouldn't mind
committing more crimes.

752
00:51:58,178 --> 00:52:01,012
In recent years, many gamblers
in Macau were hit on the head

753
00:52:01,178 --> 00:52:02,262
and robbed.

754
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:04,595
It must be him.

755
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,136
Shall we arrest him?

756
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,136
Of course. But how?

757
00:52:13,803 --> 00:52:15,553
- Do you have a credit card?
- Yes.

758
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,303
- Do you have a credit line of 300,000?
- Yes.

759
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:21,719
Bet against him.

760
00:52:22,136 --> 00:52:23,969
I'll pretend to join.

761
00:52:24,761 --> 00:52:26,803
Trap him. Piss him off.

762
00:52:26,886 --> 00:52:29,344
Make him hate you so much
that he wants to kill you.

763
00:52:29,886 --> 00:52:31,136
All by myself?

764
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:32,636
Of course. Just be confident.

765
00:52:33,011 --> 00:52:34,594
Find a crude person to imitate.

766
00:52:34,677 --> 00:52:35,552
In real life,

767
00:52:35,636 --> 00:52:38,386
- there's always a crude person around.
- Six.

768
00:52:38,802 --> 00:52:42,427
- Three lines.
- Seven.

769
00:52:42,552 --> 00:52:43,719
- It's six. Seven.
- Three lines.

770
00:52:43,802 --> 00:52:44,886
- Three lines.
- Seven.

771
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:45,802
There!

772
00:52:45,886 --> 00:52:47,052
Shit!

773
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:52,594
King or Jack?

774
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,219
Thirty thousand dollars on Banker.

775
00:52:57,344 --> 00:52:58,719
One hundred thousand on Player.

776
00:53:10,885 --> 00:53:11,718
Hey.

777
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:15,218
I can't see.
Please place my bet on Player for me.

778
00:53:19,218 --> 00:53:20,093
No more bets.

779
00:53:23,426 --> 00:53:24,343
Number five for Player.

780
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:26,635
- Number seven for Banker.
- Give me the cards.

781
00:53:29,426 --> 00:53:31,176
- Player, Banker.
- I'll kill you!

782
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,343
- Player...
- I'll kill you!

783
00:53:32,426 --> 00:53:33,718
- Banker.
- I'll slice you into pieces!

784
00:53:33,801 --> 00:53:34,843
I'll slice you into pieces!

785
00:53:34,968 --> 00:53:37,176
Seven. Sure win.

786
00:53:37,259 --> 00:53:38,718
Seven, your ass!

787
00:53:38,801 --> 00:53:40,634
- Seven for Player. Show your hand.
- I'll kill you.

788
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:42,759
- Eight.
- TV screens.

789
00:53:42,843 --> 00:53:46,218
Kill!

790
00:53:46,301 --> 00:53:47,801
Three-lines.

791
00:53:47,884 --> 00:53:49,134
TV screens.

792
00:53:49,217 --> 00:53:50,592
Right. Two TV screens.

793
00:53:50,676 --> 00:53:52,176
One for TVB. One for i-Cable.

794
00:53:52,884 --> 00:53:54,634
One more card.

795
00:53:54,801 --> 00:53:56,259
Banker draws.

796
00:53:56,384 --> 00:54:02,176
TV screens.

797
00:54:02,259 --> 00:54:04,009
Three-lines.

798
00:54:04,092 --> 00:54:07,092
Go to hell.

799
00:54:07,175 --> 00:54:08,509
Come on.

800
00:54:08,759 --> 00:54:11,592
Yes, one more TV screen for now!

801
00:54:13,675 --> 00:54:14,800
Seven for Player.

802
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:16,759
Zero for Banker. Player wins.

803
00:54:18,842 --> 00:54:19,758
I've won.

804
00:54:29,758 --> 00:54:30,675
Player.

805
00:54:31,342 --> 00:54:32,300
Banker.

806
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:33,383
Banker.

807
00:54:33,591 --> 00:54:34,508
Player.

808
00:54:34,591 --> 00:54:35,508
Player.

809
00:54:35,591 --> 00:54:37,300
- Banker.
- Fuck off!

810
00:54:37,591 --> 00:54:38,508
Banker.

811
00:54:40,091 --> 00:54:41,008
Player.

812
00:54:41,133 --> 00:54:43,091
You should follow the winner.

813
00:54:43,175 --> 00:54:45,008
Player.

814
00:54:46,841 --> 00:54:48,591
I'll bet on Player.

815
00:54:48,674 --> 00:54:50,133
Banker.

816
00:54:53,841 --> 00:54:57,133
Nine, I won!

817
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:05,716
Four. Give me a two-line.

818
00:55:06,049 --> 00:55:09,799
- Two lines.
- Beat it.

819
00:55:09,882 --> 00:55:15,507
- Two lines.
- Beat it.

820
00:55:15,591 --> 00:55:16,507
Shit.

821
00:55:16,591 --> 00:55:20,632
Blow it.

822
00:55:20,715 --> 00:55:21,674
Blow it.

823
00:55:22,132 --> 00:55:23,424
- Do you want that?
- No.

824
00:55:25,382 --> 00:55:26,549
Shit!

825
00:55:28,132 --> 00:55:32,465
Nine. I won!

826
00:55:33,257 --> 00:55:34,798
What was that? Do you want to hit me?

827
00:55:34,882 --> 00:55:35,923
Come at me.

828
00:55:36,257 --> 00:55:42,632
This guy is going to beat up a woman!

829
00:55:46,048 --> 00:55:48,673
Thank you. I've won again.

830
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,631
- I'd like to buy some.
- Which flavor?

831
00:56:05,714 --> 00:56:07,214
A little bit of each.

832
00:56:08,423 --> 00:56:09,256
<i>Hello?</i>

833
00:56:09,339 --> 00:56:11,381
Johnston? I don't think he's following me.

834
00:56:11,756 --> 00:56:14,339
<i>Impossible! I'm sure he will.</i>

835
00:56:15,131 --> 00:56:16,423
Don't look back, though.

836
00:56:18,464 --> 00:56:20,047
<i>You should go to a remote place.</i>

837
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:21,131
<i>Somewhere secluded.</i>

838
00:56:22,006 --> 00:56:22,881
Secluded?

839
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:24,256
<i>Trust me.</i>

840
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:25,464
You were so annoying.

841
00:56:25,547 --> 00:56:27,589
He lost all his money because of you.
Also, you're a woman.

842
00:56:27,672 --> 00:56:29,047
He'll surely beat the hell out of you.

843
00:56:29,256 --> 00:56:31,214
<i>Just call me after it's over.</i>

844
00:56:49,505 --> 00:56:50,880
Curry Restaurant, Taipa Village.

845
00:57:19,004 --> 00:57:21,838
Let me try the egg rolls.

846
00:57:40,296 --> 00:57:41,254
You found him?

847
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:45,670
What did you think?

848
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:47,462
I'm sure it's him. You're blind.

849
00:57:47,545 --> 00:57:48,462
It's easier to follow you.

850
00:57:48,545 --> 00:57:50,170
I told you he didn't come after me.

851
00:57:51,837 --> 00:57:54,045
You're very smart. Now what?

852
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,337
You're in great danger.

853
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,420
He'll attack you.

854
00:57:56,504 --> 00:57:57,337
What shall I do?

855
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:59,420
Where are you?

856
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,962
I'll come to your rescue.

857
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:04,212
That's nice. Hurry, then.

858
00:58:04,295 --> 00:58:05,295
Thank you.

859
00:58:53,461 --> 00:58:55,211
We've arrived? How much is the fare?

860
00:58:56,002 --> 00:58:57,127
It's 68 dollars.

861
00:59:15,627 --> 00:59:19,252
Help! Murder!

862
00:59:24,668 --> 00:59:26,627
Help! Where the hell are you, Ho?

863
00:59:41,543 --> 00:59:44,251
Come down, blind man.
You haven't paid yet.

864
00:59:44,918 --> 00:59:46,043
I'm just a cab driver.

865
00:59:46,126 --> 00:59:49,043
You think I'm stupid?
You're holding a hammer.

866
00:59:49,793 --> 00:59:52,793
You're the one behind
all the recent murders in Macau.

867
00:59:53,001 --> 00:59:55,959
Arrest this murderer, Ho!

868
00:59:56,043 --> 00:59:57,084
Who's Ho?

869
00:59:57,876 --> 00:59:58,793
Who are you?

870
00:59:58,876 --> 01:00:00,709
I'm here to arrest you, Lee.

871
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:02,417
You killed Tak and Kau.

872
01:00:02,751 --> 01:00:04,084
You thought no one would find out.

873
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:06,667
The cold-blooded killer's here, Ho!

874
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:07,792
Who's Ho?

875
01:00:08,959 --> 01:00:09,834
What else do you know?

876
01:00:09,917 --> 01:00:12,792
You dismembered Tak,
mixed the body parts with other corpses

877
01:00:13,292 --> 01:00:15,417
to hide his corpse
and make it appear he's on the run!

878
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:17,875
He's absolutely ruthless, Ho!

879
01:00:17,959 --> 01:00:18,917
Who's Ho?

880
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:22,625
There's no way you would have known.
I was the only one there.

881
01:00:26,417 --> 01:00:27,500
What's that in your hand?

882
01:00:29,333 --> 01:00:31,583
<i>There's no way you would have known.
I was the only one there.</i>

883
01:00:32,167 --> 01:00:34,417
You son of a bitch! You'll die!

884
01:00:35,667 --> 01:00:37,750
He wants to silence me, Ho!

885
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:39,333
Stop! Go back a bit.

886
01:00:39,417 --> 01:00:41,542
He wants to silence me, Ho!

887
01:00:43,625 --> 01:00:45,250
Ho!

888
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,166
Call the police.

889
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:51,541
I'm dialing.

890
01:00:52,333 --> 01:00:54,333
He wants to silence me, Ho!

891
01:00:54,666 --> 01:00:57,958
Where are you? I'm dying.

892
01:00:58,208 --> 01:00:59,624
Ho, help me!

893
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:06,874
Ho, help me!

894
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:10,583
I am dying, Ho!

895
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:12,166
I'm coming!

896
01:01:14,999 --> 01:01:16,541
Hit him.

897
01:01:18,499 --> 01:01:19,666
Ho?

898
01:01:47,998 --> 01:01:49,415
What happened?

899
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:50,707
He passed out.

900
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:03,415
That hurt.

901
01:02:03,706 --> 01:02:04,540
It's okay.

902
01:02:06,706 --> 01:02:08,040
That hurt.

903
01:02:09,206 --> 01:02:10,581
You're in a very good mood.

904
01:02:11,081 --> 01:02:13,414
Of course, it's because
I'm one step closer to my dream.

905
01:02:13,914 --> 01:02:14,789
What dream?

906
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:16,331
To see again.

907
01:02:16,498 --> 01:02:18,664
There are researches
on using stem cells for retinal implant

908
01:02:18,956 --> 01:02:20,956
and tests on electronic eyes.

909
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,498
Although chances are still remote,

910
01:02:22,581 --> 01:02:24,331
there's no harm to start saving money now.

911
01:02:25,914 --> 01:02:26,789
Johnston,

912
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:29,581
how do I look in your imagination?

913
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,497
Maybe similar to Officer Susan.

914
01:02:34,456 --> 01:02:35,456
Officer Susan?

915
01:02:35,539 --> 01:02:36,914
Who's she?

916
01:02:37,247 --> 01:02:38,706
She works in Kowloon West District.

917
01:02:39,872 --> 01:02:41,081
You can dance really well.

918
01:02:41,164 --> 01:02:42,539
That's because you can lead.

919
01:02:43,414 --> 01:02:44,539
Are you free this Saturday?

920
01:02:47,914 --> 01:02:49,289
Well, yes or no?

921
01:02:49,372 --> 01:02:50,622
Yes.

922
01:02:58,622 --> 01:02:59,622
Let's go.

923
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:06,372
You've grown taller.

924
01:03:06,747 --> 01:03:07,705
A little bit.

925
01:03:08,288 --> 01:03:09,413
How much is a little bit?

926
01:03:09,788 --> 01:03:12,205
Watch out.

927
01:03:14,538 --> 01:03:15,871
<i>Where are we going, Johnston?</i>

928
01:03:17,496 --> 01:03:19,705
Tango Blue, the dance studio opposite
the food vendor last time.

929
01:03:20,788 --> 01:03:21,871
Got that.

930
01:03:22,413 --> 01:03:24,830
Bring me to her

931
01:03:24,913 --> 01:03:26,288
and you may leave.

932
01:03:26,746 --> 01:03:28,538
Me, leave? Who is she?

933
01:03:28,913 --> 01:03:32,079
You may leave upon bringing me there.

934
01:03:32,288 --> 01:03:33,871
You want to catch the suspect by yourself?

935
01:03:33,954 --> 01:03:34,788
No, you must not...

936
01:03:34,871 --> 01:03:37,204
What culprit? She's my dream girl.

937
01:03:37,288 --> 01:03:39,246
I had fallen in love with her
before I became blind.

938
01:03:39,871 --> 01:03:42,829
I dreamed of seeing her again.

939
01:03:43,412 --> 01:03:45,121
What do you think of her? Pretty, right?

940
01:03:45,496 --> 01:03:46,621
Isn't she's gorgeous?

941
01:03:46,704 --> 01:03:47,912
A good match for me, right?

942
01:03:48,371 --> 01:03:49,496
The drawing is upside down.

943
01:03:50,162 --> 01:03:50,996
What a perfect match.

944
01:03:51,621 --> 01:03:53,371
Only a great beauty like her

945
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:55,496
deserves a handsome man like me.

946
01:03:55,579 --> 01:03:57,537
We're born for each other.

947
01:03:58,287 --> 01:03:59,704
Is my tie crooked?

948
01:04:11,245 --> 01:04:14,620
Well? Do you see her?

949
01:04:15,162 --> 01:04:18,620
She's dancing. At your twelve o'clock.

950
01:04:24,453 --> 01:04:25,578
Go there.

951
01:04:26,536 --> 01:04:27,495
Come on.

952
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,578
Should I wait for you here?

953
01:04:30,661 --> 01:04:31,536
No need.

954
01:04:31,703 --> 01:04:33,828
- I can pick you up when you're done.
- No need.

955
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:34,745
Should I wait for you?

956
01:04:34,828 --> 01:04:35,995
Will you be back for the night?

957
01:04:36,078 --> 01:04:37,203
Should I lock the door?

958
01:04:37,286 --> 01:04:38,286
Go away.

959
01:04:43,494 --> 01:04:44,703
Where do I go?

960
01:04:46,911 --> 01:04:49,244
How are you? I'm Johnston.

961
01:04:50,161 --> 01:04:51,453
Hi, I'm Ding Ding.

962
01:04:51,744 --> 01:04:52,953
May I dance with you?

963
01:04:53,953 --> 01:04:55,619
Don't worry. I won't step on you.

964
01:05:35,702 --> 01:05:36,785
Am I doing okay?

965
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,035
Yes, you're great.

966
01:05:39,868 --> 01:05:41,868
I've been waiting
for this moment for four years.

967
01:05:43,326 --> 01:05:45,326
My friend and I used
to eat gizzard downstairs.

968
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:48,535
I fell in love with you

969
01:05:50,618 --> 01:05:52,201
the first time I set my eyes on you.

970
01:05:55,326 --> 01:05:56,576
I fell in love with you right away.

971
01:06:00,451 --> 01:06:02,368
Isn't the girl dancing up there great?

972
01:06:02,451 --> 01:06:03,284
KEE KEI

973
01:06:05,534 --> 01:06:07,618
Not bad-looking. Small boobs, though.

974
01:06:07,701 --> 01:06:08,576
Hey!

975
01:06:08,701 --> 01:06:10,076
She's going to be my future wife.

976
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:11,034
I'm sorry.

977
01:06:12,909 --> 01:06:15,159
<i>I was thinking to introduce myself
after I finished my case.</i>

978
01:06:15,492 --> 01:06:17,201
<i>- I never thought that I'd go blind.</i>
- That hurt.

979
01:06:17,284 --> 01:06:18,909
- Sorry.
- No problem.

980
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:23,034
I asked my friend
to look for you afterward.

981
01:06:23,784 --> 01:06:24,700
But he failed.

982
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:27,700
I'm so lucky to see you again.

983
01:06:27,784 --> 01:06:29,992
- That hurt!
- Sorry.

984
01:06:31,117 --> 01:06:32,034
No problem.

985
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,200
I understand I'm being rude.

986
01:06:34,742 --> 01:06:40,783
But please give me a chance to date you.

987
01:06:54,866 --> 01:06:55,908
Am I too late?

988
01:06:56,866 --> 01:06:58,783
Yes. I'm married.

989
01:07:06,158 --> 01:07:07,908
Sorry for bothering you.

990
01:07:17,824 --> 01:07:20,158
<i>Johnston, I have bad news.</i>

991
01:07:20,241 --> 01:07:21,533
<i>Keep calm and listen.</i>

992
01:07:21,616 --> 01:07:23,824
What's the bad news?

993
01:07:24,616 --> 01:07:26,324
The reward money is gone.

994
01:07:27,491 --> 01:07:29,741
You didn't extend the deadline for me?
Or have you forgotten?

995
01:07:29,991 --> 01:07:33,741
It's not my fault.
The Finance Department declined.

996
01:07:34,366 --> 01:07:35,657
I'm not the boss.

997
01:07:35,782 --> 01:07:37,741
I'm just Chief Inspector Szeto Fatbo.

998
01:07:37,991 --> 01:07:39,157
You think I can do magic?

999
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,699
- Hubby.
- Darling.

1000
01:07:42,574 --> 01:07:43,449
Have some gizzard.

1001
01:07:51,907 --> 01:07:53,948
Sorry, my boss is looking for me.

1002
01:07:54,157 --> 01:07:55,407
I'll go first. Bye.

1003
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:58,573
You got married?

1004
01:07:59,698 --> 01:08:02,615
You and her? You married her?

1005
01:08:03,407 --> 01:08:06,448
I tried to tell you
in your home last time.

1006
01:08:06,532 --> 01:08:07,948
I asked you to be a go-between,

1007
01:08:08,032 --> 01:08:09,156
and you married her.

1008
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:10,865
What kind of friend are you?

1009
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:13,781
Let me explain.

1010
01:08:14,781 --> 01:08:17,323
Come closer, and I'll beat you up.

1011
01:08:18,448 --> 01:08:19,615
Wrong direction, three o'clock.

1012
01:08:19,698 --> 01:08:20,781
Don't pity me.

1013
01:08:54,364 --> 01:08:55,405
Excuse me, buddy.

1014
01:08:55,489 --> 01:08:57,072
Is Officer Susan here?

1015
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:01,155
I'm Susan,

1016
01:09:06,155 --> 01:09:07,114
but I'm not your buddy.

1017
01:09:50,696 --> 01:09:52,612
What's the matter, Johnston?

1018
01:09:53,654 --> 01:09:54,696
I figured it out.

1019
01:09:56,404 --> 01:09:58,404
When I was walking on the street,
feeling heartbroken,

1020
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:02,279
I suddenly recalled a case about
a missing woman in 1996.

1021
01:10:03,487 --> 01:10:06,362
She was dumped by her boyfriend

1022
01:10:06,987 --> 01:10:08,320
and disappeared on the same night.

1023
01:10:08,945 --> 01:10:10,404
What does that have to do with Minnie?

1024
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:12,987
Wasn't Minnie kind of heartbroken
before she disappeared?

1025
01:10:13,404 --> 01:10:14,320
Yes.

1026
01:10:14,612 --> 01:10:15,737
There lies the similarity.

1027
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:20,404
Heartbroken then disappeared.

1028
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,278
You mean there might be
a psychotic serial killer

1029
01:10:24,403 --> 01:10:26,403
who targeted heartbroken women?

1030
01:10:26,778 --> 01:10:27,987
I'm almost certain.

1031
01:10:28,528 --> 01:10:29,487
Szeto Fatbo.

1032
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:30,820
This is not a truce.

1033
01:10:30,945 --> 01:10:33,278
I won't listen to any of your explanation.

1034
01:10:33,487 --> 01:10:34,945
You want to go on? I'll hang up.

1035
01:10:38,861 --> 01:10:43,611
Listen! Find all missing females' files
in the last decade.

1036
01:10:43,736 --> 01:10:47,153
Check out those who had been jilted
before they disappeared.

1037
01:10:47,236 --> 01:10:48,653
Bring these files to me. Hurry!

1038
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:50,403
What's going on?

1039
01:10:51,111 --> 01:10:52,069
Let's go.

1040
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:53,903
So you are heartbroken,

1041
01:10:53,986 --> 01:10:55,278
walking on the street alone?

1042
01:10:55,528 --> 01:10:56,778
That son-of-a-bitch betrayed me.

1043
01:10:56,861 --> 01:10:58,361
He stole the love of my life

1044
01:10:59,611 --> 01:11:00,486
and married her.

1045
01:11:03,819 --> 01:11:08,319
Forget it,
maybe you'll find a better lady.

1046
01:11:08,944 --> 01:11:10,611
It's not an easy job.

1047
01:11:10,861 --> 01:11:12,277
A great woman is rare to come by.

1048
01:11:12,361 --> 01:11:13,986
You can't see her anyway,

1049
01:11:14,361 --> 01:11:16,694
even if she looks like Susan.

1050
01:11:17,652 --> 01:11:19,777
She'll make me lose face
in front of my friends.

1051
01:11:32,944 --> 01:11:34,944
Johnston, I'm here.

1052
01:11:39,985 --> 01:11:41,610
You ordered so many dishes.

1053
01:11:49,193 --> 01:11:50,277
Thank you.

1054
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,485
And shark's fin soup, too.

1055
01:11:59,151 --> 01:12:00,026
Abalone?

1056
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:01,735
Try some.

1057
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:03,693
- Just rice will do.
- Okay.

1058
01:12:06,526 --> 01:12:07,359
Here.

1059
01:12:07,443 --> 01:12:08,609
Here are the files you wanted.

1060
01:12:09,234 --> 01:12:11,734
They are hard to come by.

1061
01:12:11,859 --> 01:12:14,234
I've spent several nights compiling them.

1062
01:12:14,651 --> 01:12:16,651
These are all confidential.

1063
01:12:16,984 --> 01:12:18,318
It took a lot of strings to get them.

1064
01:12:18,401 --> 01:12:19,401
Give them to me.

1065
01:12:25,776 --> 01:12:26,734
They're heavy.

1066
01:12:39,192 --> 01:12:42,109
I know I did something bad to you.

1067
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:44,650
You have every right to be mad.

1068
01:12:47,234 --> 01:12:49,817
But please listen to my explanation.

1069
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:58,192
I don't love you. Go to hell.

1070
01:13:02,275 --> 01:13:04,692
How does that feel?

1071
01:13:04,775 --> 01:13:05,983
Nothing.

1072
01:13:06,816 --> 01:13:07,983
Come up here.

1073
01:13:08,066 --> 01:13:09,941
I'm coming.

1074
01:13:16,233 --> 01:13:18,650
Are you making a movie? So many pads.

1075
01:13:20,066 --> 01:13:21,691
I'll get hurt.

1076
01:13:22,066 --> 01:13:23,441
That's the point.

1077
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:25,649
I want you to feel their pain.

1078
01:13:26,149 --> 01:13:27,066
Remove all of them.

1079
01:13:34,149 --> 01:13:35,649
- Can you do it?
- Yes.

1080
01:13:35,732 --> 01:13:36,816
- Are you sure.
- Yes.

1081
01:13:36,899 --> 01:13:37,774
Hold on.

1082
01:13:48,649 --> 01:13:50,774
Dickhead, did you dump me for her?

1083
01:13:50,857 --> 01:13:51,815
Of course.

1084
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:55,774
I'm prettier than you,
my boobs are bigger.

1085
01:13:58,690 --> 01:13:59,857
Sorry.

1086
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:01,940
Go on!

1087
01:14:03,232 --> 01:14:04,315
You're not jumping?

1088
01:14:06,273 --> 01:14:07,315
Let's go get a room.

1089
01:14:14,565 --> 01:14:15,940
Watch out! Take it easy!

1090
01:14:16,232 --> 01:14:18,190
Can you get into the character?
You can do it, right?

1091
01:14:42,814 --> 01:14:43,648
What's wrong?

1092
01:14:43,731 --> 01:14:46,523
I can't get into character
if I restrain myself.

1093
01:14:47,106 --> 01:14:48,773
Let's play it for real. Just once.

1094
01:14:49,856 --> 01:14:50,856
All right.

1095
01:14:58,481 --> 01:14:59,397
Why?

1096
01:14:59,772 --> 01:15:01,772
Why did two people so much in love

1097
01:15:04,147 --> 01:15:05,939
would end up like this?

1098
01:15:06,855 --> 01:15:09,272
Breaking up is always ugly and nasty.

1099
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:12,855
The opposite of love is hate.

1100
01:15:14,105 --> 01:15:18,522
But Susan and the likes of
you won't understand this,

1101
01:15:18,605 --> 01:15:19,980
because you have never been in love.

1102
01:15:20,063 --> 01:15:20,897
Right?

1103
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:26,730
You're done?

1104
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:28,063
I'm full.

1105
01:15:29,397 --> 01:15:30,355
That's right.

1106
01:15:30,772 --> 01:15:32,688
Keep up that attitude.

1107
01:15:33,396 --> 01:15:34,271
Let me finish it.

1108
01:16:17,979 --> 01:16:18,895
Johnston?

1109
01:16:20,062 --> 01:16:21,395
Are you sure I have to get a tattoo?

1110
01:16:21,895 --> 01:16:24,979
Does it have to be "Forever Valentino"?

1111
01:16:25,312 --> 01:16:29,104
The statement said the missing girl
had such a tattoo.

1112
01:16:29,354 --> 01:16:32,937
It's awful. I don't know any Valentino.

1113
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:34,937
And I don't love Valentino.

1114
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:37,145
Even the tattooist reminded me
to think twice.

1115
01:16:37,228 --> 01:16:38,562
I'll be stuck with it

1116
01:16:38,812 --> 01:16:39,853
Then forget it.

1117
01:16:40,603 --> 01:16:41,645
We'll stop investigating.

1118
01:17:07,103 --> 01:17:08,061
Vinci Lai.

1119
01:17:09,311 --> 01:17:11,269
<i>Where did you go after you got the tattoo?</i>

1120
01:17:17,852 --> 01:17:20,144
May Wong, where did you go?

1121
01:17:43,644 --> 01:17:46,060
Kay Yeung, where did you go?

1122
01:17:49,852 --> 01:17:52,685
Karen Man, where did you go?

1123
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:01,310
And Sylvia Choi, where were you?

1124
01:18:06,185 --> 01:18:07,101
Where

1125
01:18:11,268 --> 01:18:12,226
did you all go?

1126
01:19:41,933 --> 01:19:45,891
The murderer is a cab driver

1127
01:19:52,016 --> 01:19:52,891
Where are you going?

1128
01:19:52,974 --> 01:19:53,891
I'll find the taxi driver.

1129
01:19:55,932 --> 01:19:57,724
I'll find the taxi driver.

1130
01:19:57,807 --> 01:19:59,391
How will you do that?

1131
01:20:00,224 --> 01:20:02,349
Tell me the date when they went missing.

1132
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:09,682
Hannah Leung went missing
on February 1995.

1133
01:20:09,807 --> 01:20:10,932
Speak clearly.

1134
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:13,890
For the past few days.

1135
01:20:14,432 --> 01:20:18,432
I was dumped by you for ten times.
I'm heartbroken.

1136
01:20:18,598 --> 01:20:19,765
But I'm trying my best.

1137
01:20:20,557 --> 01:20:25,598
Hannah Leung, February 7, 1995.

1138
01:20:27,557 --> 01:20:30,848
<i>May Wong, October 11, 1996.</i>

1139
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:35,473
<i>Karen Man, May 22, 1997.</i>

1140
01:20:36,556 --> 01:20:40,181
<i>Lilian Lee, December 28, 1998.</i>

1141
01:20:40,931 --> 01:20:44,515
<i>Haley Cheung, September 9, 1999.</i>

1142
01:20:45,181 --> 01:20:48,723
<i>Fanny Chan, February 14, 2002.</i>

1143
01:20:49,348 --> 01:20:52,931
<i>Kay Yeung, March 19, 2003.</i>

1144
01:20:53,514 --> 01:20:56,889
<i>Hilda Ko, August 25, 2004.</i>

1145
01:20:57,806 --> 01:21:01,139
<i>Vinci Lai, November 30, 2005.</i>

1146
01:21:02,222 --> 01:21:04,889
<i>Sylvia Choi, January 12, 2006.</i>

1147
01:21:05,389 --> 01:21:09,306
And Minnie, June 20, 1997.

1148
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:19,222
The murderer didn't commit
any crime in 2000 and 2001.

1149
01:21:20,555 --> 01:21:23,430
And no more such cases after 2006.

1150
01:21:24,805 --> 01:21:26,097
What happened to the murderer?

1151
01:21:27,639 --> 01:21:31,222
Did I have enough money for the taxi?

1152
01:21:31,305 --> 01:21:34,180
You're heartbroken.
It didn't come across your mind.

1153
01:21:34,513 --> 01:21:36,763
Why was I heartbroken?

1154
01:21:37,388 --> 01:21:40,805
These other girls broke up
with their boyfriends.

1155
01:21:40,888 --> 01:21:42,430
I'm unlike them.

1156
01:21:43,138 --> 01:21:44,596
You're close friends.

1157
01:21:44,721 --> 01:21:46,846
You're heartbroken
because she avoided you.

1158
01:21:46,971 --> 01:21:49,388
You waited for her
until midnight and took a taxi.

1159
01:21:55,388 --> 01:21:57,388
You must have fallen for her secretly.

1160
01:21:57,513 --> 01:21:58,471
You're a lesbian.

1161
01:21:58,596 --> 01:22:00,929
Not uncommon
for an adolescent girl like you.

1162
01:22:02,388 --> 01:22:03,388
You must be.

1163
01:22:05,096 --> 01:22:06,763
Hello, Szeto Fatbo.

1164
01:22:07,096 --> 01:22:09,054
Hey, this is not a truce.

1165
01:22:09,429 --> 01:22:11,221
Listen, find taxi drivers

1166
01:22:11,304 --> 01:22:14,429
who quit driving between 2000 and 2001.

1167
01:22:30,887 --> 01:22:34,095
Bastard! He didn't come himself.

1168
01:22:35,054 --> 01:22:38,387
I volunteered to come. May I sit down?

1169
01:22:48,553 --> 01:22:49,720
Szeto is very unhappy.

1170
01:22:50,428 --> 01:22:51,762
I don't want him to stay like that.

1171
01:22:53,262 --> 01:22:54,887
It was not quite like you thought.

1172
01:22:56,262 --> 01:22:59,053
There were things even Szeto didn't know.

1173
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:10,511
<i>The truth is,
when I first saw both of you,</i>

1174
01:23:11,303 --> 01:23:15,303
<i>Szeto was the one I was attracted to.</i>

1175
01:23:16,761 --> 01:23:17,719
I fell for him immediately.

1176
01:23:25,844 --> 01:23:28,636
<i>I planned to go after him
after the dance contest.</i>

1177
01:23:29,219 --> 01:23:30,844
<i>But I haven't seen the two of you again</i>

1178
01:23:31,802 --> 01:23:33,177
<i>until that day.</i>

1179
01:23:33,802 --> 01:23:38,094
Sir, who are you looking for?

1180
01:23:41,886 --> 01:23:43,760
You're not allowed into
the ladies' changing room.

1181
01:23:50,677 --> 01:23:52,135
The man is quite well-built,

1182
01:23:52,219 --> 01:23:53,594
wears a leather jacket, smokes a cigar

1183
01:23:53,677 --> 01:23:55,510
and acts arrogantly.
Do you know what he wants?

1184
01:23:56,594 --> 01:23:57,593
KEE KEI

1185
01:24:22,551 --> 01:24:24,468
Hey, are you all right?

1186
01:24:25,676 --> 01:24:27,551
It's not my fault.
She suddenly dashed out.

1187
01:24:27,634 --> 01:24:28,759
Call the ambulance.

1188
01:24:30,218 --> 01:24:31,051
Don't be afraid.

1189
01:24:31,509 --> 01:24:32,551
I'm Senior Inspector,

1190
01:24:32,926 --> 01:24:34,093
Szeto Fatbo.

1191
01:24:37,759 --> 01:24:38,593
Don't be afraid.

1192
01:24:38,843 --> 01:24:41,384
<i>It turned out the man I admired was</i>

1193
01:24:42,176 --> 01:24:43,759
<i>a Dirty Harry type of cop.</i>

1194
01:24:44,551 --> 01:24:45,759
At that moment,

1195
01:24:48,051 --> 01:24:51,509
I decided to be with that man

1196
01:24:52,342 --> 01:24:54,134
for the rest of my life.

1197
01:24:55,342 --> 01:24:57,259
He's my one life, one love.

1198
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:58,300
That's enough.

1199
01:24:58,925 --> 01:24:59,967
I get the picture.

1200
01:25:03,884 --> 01:25:05,134
But may I ask one question,

1201
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:10,759
you said when you saw us,

1202
01:25:11,342 --> 01:25:12,758
the one you got attracted to was him.

1203
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:14,717
Why?

1204
01:25:15,967 --> 01:25:16,925
He's cool.

1205
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,383
Tell me, who's more good-looking?

1206
01:25:22,467 --> 01:25:24,383
She must be blind.

1207
01:25:25,175 --> 01:25:27,758
She told you she's infatuated with Szeto.

1208
01:25:28,133 --> 01:25:30,341
It's you who thought otherwise.

1209
01:25:30,675 --> 01:25:32,341
It was just your wishful thinking.

1210
01:25:41,216 --> 01:25:42,174
Stand still.

1211
01:25:44,383 --> 01:25:45,383
Eye on the window.

1212
01:25:49,591 --> 01:25:51,591
Imagine yourself as Minnie.

1213
01:25:57,382 --> 01:25:58,382
Slit your wrist.

1214
01:26:02,841 --> 01:26:04,007
It's a real knife.

1215
01:26:04,424 --> 01:26:06,174
You've got nothing to lose
with looks like Susan.

1216
01:26:06,382 --> 01:26:07,549
There will be scars.

1217
01:26:07,632 --> 01:26:10,591
Scars are bad for pretty girls, not Susan.

1218
01:26:10,674 --> 01:26:12,007
Okay!

1219
01:26:29,465 --> 01:26:30,340
How was that?

1220
01:26:32,132 --> 01:26:33,173
How did that feel?

1221
01:26:33,673 --> 01:26:35,548
I overreacted, I must say.

1222
01:26:36,132 --> 01:26:38,465
I do feel sad, but not heartbroken enough.

1223
01:26:38,548 --> 01:26:39,757
It felt a bit forced.

1224
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:43,465
Got it.

1225
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:46,548
Once more.

1226
01:26:50,048 --> 01:26:51,131
Just imagine.

1227
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:54,631
Minnie took after her grandma

1228
01:26:55,465 --> 01:26:57,423
who has completely lost in love, okay?

1229
01:27:00,631 --> 01:27:02,881
You're Minnie. At school...

1230
01:27:02,964 --> 01:27:04,673
you had no friends, but it's all right

1231
01:27:05,798 --> 01:27:07,673
because you only cared for one boy.

1232
01:27:08,798 --> 01:27:11,922
You secretly loved him.
You really liked him.

1233
01:27:13,047 --> 01:27:15,297
Finally, you two started a relationship.

1234
01:27:15,922 --> 01:27:17,339
You guys were happily dating each other.

1235
01:27:18,422 --> 01:27:19,881
But soon, he grew tired of you.

1236
01:27:20,922 --> 01:27:22,589
He decided to break up with you.

1237
01:27:23,839 --> 01:27:24,881
He dumped you,

1238
01:27:25,922 --> 01:27:26,964
you were deeply hurt.

1239
01:27:28,047 --> 01:27:33,005
It hurt so much,
you started to mutilate yourself.

1240
01:27:49,505 --> 01:27:50,713
Enough.

1241
01:27:50,797 --> 01:27:53,172
Stop, Ho!

1242
01:27:53,255 --> 01:27:56,546
Stop!

1243
01:28:03,338 --> 01:28:04,671
Minnie wasn't waiting for you.

1244
01:28:06,213 --> 01:28:08,421
Was someone living upstairs?

1245
01:28:08,505 --> 01:28:11,213
- It's been vacated for a long time.
- I mean, when Minnie used to come here!

1246
01:28:11,463 --> 01:28:12,588
Yes.

1247
01:28:14,254 --> 01:28:16,171
Was it a boy in the same age as Minnie?

1248
01:28:18,213 --> 01:28:19,129
Yes.

1249
01:28:19,588 --> 01:28:21,421
Did he study in the same school?
Was he good-looking?

1250
01:28:22,504 --> 01:28:23,379
Yes!

1251
01:28:24,129 --> 01:28:25,129
<i>Where is he?</i>

1252
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:43,170
Grilled Jumbo Prawn. Please enjoy.

1253
01:28:43,837 --> 01:28:44,712
Thank you.

1254
01:28:45,795 --> 01:28:46,754
This way.

1255
01:28:48,504 --> 01:28:49,837
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1256
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:52,420
Do you want a drink?

1257
01:28:52,795 --> 01:28:54,503
- Iced sake, please.
- Sure.

1258
01:28:54,670 --> 01:28:55,628
Thank you.

1259
01:29:03,587 --> 01:29:05,170
Did you live in Hong Kong?

1260
01:29:05,587 --> 01:29:06,878
Durham Street in Kowloon Tong?

1261
01:29:07,837 --> 01:29:08,753
Yes.

1262
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:12,545
Are you Joe?

1263
01:29:14,086 --> 01:29:15,045
You are...

1264
01:29:15,211 --> 01:29:18,378
- Ho, I lived downstairs.
- Please enjoy, sir.

1265
01:29:18,711 --> 01:29:19,836
Darkie?

1266
01:29:21,461 --> 01:29:23,253
You looked completely different.

1267
01:29:23,378 --> 01:29:24,961
You have fairer skin now.

1268
01:29:25,128 --> 01:29:26,544
Almost unrecognizable.

1269
01:29:26,628 --> 01:29:27,836
What are you up to?

1270
01:29:27,919 --> 01:29:28,919
You're still picking fights?

1271
01:29:29,378 --> 01:29:30,753
No, I tripped.

1272
01:29:30,836 --> 01:29:33,961
Are you still going after cats
with air guns?

1273
01:29:34,294 --> 01:29:36,336
Of course not. That is kid's stuff.

1274
01:29:36,753 --> 01:29:38,086
Please pick your choice.

1275
01:29:40,211 --> 01:29:41,961
The Beef Set, please.

1276
01:29:42,169 --> 01:29:43,294
Thank you.

1277
01:29:44,252 --> 01:29:45,961
Didn't you emigrate to Brazil?

1278
01:29:47,919 --> 01:29:48,961
In 1997?

1279
01:29:49,127 --> 01:29:50,211
I returned three years ago

1280
01:29:50,711 --> 01:29:52,336
and started this restaurant with a friend.

1281
01:29:52,586 --> 01:29:54,210
- Okay.
- Zhuhai is a good place for business.

1282
01:29:56,877 --> 01:29:58,252
Hey, around the time you left,

1283
01:29:58,669 --> 01:29:59,710
Minnie also disappeared.

1284
01:30:00,127 --> 01:30:01,169
Did you know Minnie?

1285
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:02,419
Minnie Lee?

1286
01:30:07,419 --> 01:30:10,418
She studied in our school.
She was in the same class as you.

1287
01:30:13,252 --> 01:30:15,877
I can't recall anything.
I probably didn't know her.

1288
01:30:16,752 --> 01:30:17,668
Not at all?

1289
01:30:18,085 --> 01:30:19,585
She used to hang out at my place.

1290
01:30:21,293 --> 01:30:23,960
No, it doesn't ring a bell.

1291
01:30:26,126 --> 01:30:28,168
Fried rice, sir. Please enjoy.

1292
01:30:40,459 --> 01:30:43,459
Excuse me, one more Grilled Jumbo Prawn.

1293
01:30:43,543 --> 01:30:44,459
Of course.

1294
01:30:56,126 --> 01:30:58,001
Johnston, do you want to eat again?

1295
01:31:00,501 --> 01:31:01,751
Joe knew Minnie.

1296
01:31:02,792 --> 01:31:04,876
How did you know?

1297
01:31:05,667 --> 01:31:07,625
He was making the fried rice
when you mentioned Minnie.

1298
01:31:07,959 --> 01:31:09,209
I had a taste. It was too salty.

1299
01:31:09,625 --> 01:31:10,875
So I ordered two more dishes.

1300
01:31:14,292 --> 01:31:16,500
Grilled Jumbo Prawn. Please enjoy.

1301
01:31:17,667 --> 01:31:18,834
<i>The prawn was too dry.</i>

1302
01:31:19,417 --> 01:31:21,292
Scallop, please.

1303
01:31:21,375 --> 01:31:22,375
Coming right up.

1304
01:31:24,875 --> 01:31:26,500
<i>The scallop finally tasted right,</i>

1305
01:31:27,208 --> 01:31:30,125
which means he got distracted
at the mention of Minnie's name.

1306
01:31:30,958 --> 01:31:32,125
I smell something fishy.

1307
01:31:32,708 --> 01:31:35,083
You think I was just enjoying the food?

1308
01:31:35,833 --> 01:31:37,291
What should we do? Should we follow her?

1309
01:31:37,416 --> 01:31:38,291
Keep an eye on him.

1310
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:44,250
He's coming out, holding a rat cage.

1311
01:31:46,708 --> 01:31:48,333
He's drowning it.

1312
01:31:54,499 --> 01:31:55,708
He's the one who killed Minnie.

1313
01:31:56,749 --> 01:31:59,374
He dismembered her
and threw the body into a trash bin.

1314
01:32:06,374 --> 01:32:08,707
We've been sitting here for hours
reading magazines.

1315
01:32:08,791 --> 01:32:09,874
Who is he waiting for?

1316
01:32:10,374 --> 01:32:14,041
He's not waiting for someone to come.
He's waiting for someone to leave.

1317
01:32:15,582 --> 01:32:16,582
He's also watching somebody.

1318
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:27,832
Joe's partner is coming down
from the opposite building.

1319
01:32:42,707 --> 01:32:43,748
He settled the bill.

1320
01:32:44,082 --> 01:32:45,248
Let's do that too.

1321
01:32:45,332 --> 01:32:46,248
Bill, please.

1322
01:32:46,957 --> 01:32:48,873
- Bill, please.
- Right away.

1323
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:51,290
Hurry, give me the bill.

1324
01:32:51,623 --> 01:32:52,915
Excuse me, please wait for a moment.

1325
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,456
Joe went to his partner's building.
What now?

1326
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:08,623
Let's go and see.

1327
01:33:08,873 --> 01:33:09,748
What about the bill?

1328
01:33:09,831 --> 01:33:11,206
Leave the money on the table.

1329
01:33:22,914 --> 01:33:25,039
He's after the manager of the restaurant.

1330
01:33:25,331 --> 01:33:26,747
Wow, they're making out!

1331
01:33:37,914 --> 01:33:39,455
- What do you like to drink?
- Dragon Well tea.

1332
01:33:39,539 --> 01:33:40,372
Sure.

1333
01:33:44,164 --> 01:33:45,372
He's fucking your wife.

1334
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:46,539
Come back quickly.

1335
01:33:48,247 --> 01:33:49,622
Is that the girl who wanted the bill?

1336
01:33:49,914 --> 01:33:51,288
Yes, she's pregnant.

1337
01:33:53,247 --> 01:33:54,705
Is Joe's partner coming back?

1338
01:33:59,830 --> 01:34:00,747
He's running back.

1339
01:34:00,997 --> 01:34:02,580
The pregnant woman is Joe's wife.

1340
01:34:21,579 --> 01:34:23,996
Stupid! He's hiding in the balcony.

1341
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:34,538
Stop fighting.

1342
01:34:41,329 --> 01:34:42,704
The pregnant woman ran outside.

1343
01:34:44,662 --> 01:34:48,704
Stop fighting. Come down.

1344
01:35:03,412 --> 01:35:04,787
Joe has fallen down too.

1345
01:35:14,828 --> 01:35:16,870
Darling!

1346
01:35:17,703 --> 01:35:20,245
My dear, are you all right?

1347
01:35:22,578 --> 01:35:23,661
I got scared.

1348
01:35:24,661 --> 01:35:27,120
I'm fine.

1349
01:35:31,078 --> 01:35:32,495
The pregnant woman has gone crazy.

1350
01:35:33,453 --> 01:35:34,994
Go and help, quickly.

1351
01:35:35,411 --> 01:35:36,369
Roger.

1352
01:35:45,619 --> 01:35:48,078
Miss, you'll kill him.

1353
01:35:53,244 --> 01:35:54,494
<i>VocÃª me trai,</i>

1354
01:35:55,161 --> 01:35:57,369
<i>vou perseguir vocÃª atÃ© a morte.</i>

1355
01:36:00,286 --> 01:36:02,244
<i>VocÃª me trai,</i>

1356
01:36:03,911 --> 01:36:06,994
<i>vou perseguir vocÃª atÃ© a morte.</i>

1357
01:36:09,702 --> 01:36:10,577
Why did you lie?

1358
01:36:11,369 --> 01:36:12,952
You knew Minnie and had dated her.

1359
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:17,119
You lied because you killed her.

1360
01:36:17,702 --> 01:36:19,618
Is that right? You killed Minnie.

1361
01:36:19,702 --> 01:36:20,952
- No, I didn't.
- Excuse me.

1362
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:22,035
Are you crazy?

1363
01:36:22,118 --> 01:36:22,952
This is a hospital!

1364
01:36:27,035 --> 01:36:30,202
You molested her, a minor.

1365
01:36:30,285 --> 01:36:31,993
I was a minor too.

1366
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:37,618
It was a mutual decision.

1367
01:36:39,201 --> 01:36:41,618
What are you looking at?
I didn't kill her.

1368
01:36:42,118 --> 01:36:43,618
I really didn't kill her.

1369
01:36:44,493 --> 01:36:46,285
We dated each other for a month.

1370
01:36:46,368 --> 01:36:48,535
I dumped her after I had my fun.

1371
01:36:48,826 --> 01:36:50,993
I was getting ready to emigrate,
so I didn't go to school.

1372
01:36:51,409 --> 01:36:52,951
She kept pestering me.

1373
01:36:53,201 --> 01:36:55,909
She waited outside my house every night
and mutilated herself with a knife.

1374
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:57,451
She's crazy.

1375
01:37:00,701 --> 01:37:01,993
<i>The night I went to Brazil,</i>

1376
01:37:02,409 --> 01:37:05,742
<i>she kept chasing after the bus.</i>

1377
01:37:33,242 --> 01:37:35,117
We have five cab drivers as suspects.

1378
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:38,158
Choi was jailed
for hurting a passenger in 2000.

1379
01:37:38,242 --> 01:37:40,533
He now lives in Wong Tai Sin.
Then there's Law.

1380
01:37:40,617 --> 01:37:42,992
He underwent drug rehab in 2000.

1381
01:37:43,117 --> 01:37:44,367
Now he lives in Tsing Yi.

1382
01:37:44,533 --> 01:37:45,408
Tsui

1383
01:37:45,492 --> 01:37:47,117
went to work in China in 2000.

1384
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:49,783
He lives in Shek Pai Wan.
Then there's Chan Kwong.

1385
01:37:49,950 --> 01:37:52,033
He stayed in a mental hospital in 2000.

1386
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:53,741
He now lives in Yuen Long.

1387
01:37:53,866 --> 01:37:55,325
The last one is Ng.

1388
01:37:55,408 --> 01:37:57,491
His license was suspended
for reckless driving in 2000

1389
01:37:57,575 --> 01:37:58,575
and now lives in Kwun Tong.

1390
01:37:58,658 --> 01:37:59,741
So? Who should we pick first?

1391
01:37:59,991 --> 01:38:01,158
The one in Yuen Long.

1392
01:38:01,366 --> 01:38:03,241
Chan Kwong? Why?

1393
01:38:04,033 --> 01:38:05,908
Yuen Long has lots of good food.

1394
01:38:17,533 --> 01:38:19,116
Hey, don't eat them all.

1395
01:38:22,907 --> 01:38:25,407
Don't finish all of them.
Leave some for me.

1396
01:38:27,157 --> 01:38:30,407
You're driving. Concentrate.

1397
01:38:31,407 --> 01:38:33,907
Try some.

1398
01:39:02,323 --> 01:39:03,198
Is it tasty?

1399
01:39:45,239 --> 01:39:46,197
Who's that?

1400
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:49,572
Chan Kwong? Police!

1401
01:39:49,697 --> 01:39:51,822
Open the door.

1402
01:39:53,030 --> 01:39:53,989
Chan Kwong.

1403
01:39:58,530 --> 01:39:59,447
What's wrong?

1404
01:40:00,905 --> 01:40:02,363
He's naked.

1405
01:40:02,697 --> 01:40:04,030
He's only wearing a tennis skirt

1406
01:40:04,363 --> 01:40:05,655
and a pair of female sneakers.

1407
01:40:06,322 --> 01:40:07,655
Watch out.

1408
01:40:17,821 --> 01:40:21,488
Be on alert.
There are many female clothes.

1409
01:40:22,988 --> 01:40:27,530
Bras, panties, high heels, and handbags.

1410
01:40:34,696 --> 01:40:36,321
Where did you get
all these female clothes?

1411
01:40:37,488 --> 01:40:38,738
The pretty chicks left them behind.

1412
01:40:39,279 --> 01:40:42,738
Do you remember picking up a young girl

1413
01:40:43,279 --> 01:40:45,613
wearing a tennis outfit
on October 11, 1996?

1414
01:40:46,529 --> 01:40:49,862
In 1996? Wearing a tennis outfit?

1415
01:40:50,279 --> 01:40:51,737
Like the one you're wearing.

1416
01:40:55,696 --> 01:40:57,321
Yes.

1417
01:41:05,029 --> 01:41:06,070
What happened?

1418
01:41:07,445 --> 01:41:08,862
She got in my cab.

1419
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:14,612
She was in tears. She looked very sad.

1420
01:41:15,487 --> 01:41:17,612
But she's very pretty and attractive.

1421
01:41:18,403 --> 01:41:19,362
And then?

1422
01:41:20,195 --> 01:41:21,320
What did you do to her?

1423
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:26,320
Did you drive her here, raped her,

1424
01:41:26,403 --> 01:41:27,945
and killed her when she resisted?

1425
01:41:28,528 --> 01:41:31,528
No, I only ate her eyes.

1426
01:41:34,278 --> 01:41:35,278
Where is she?

1427
01:41:35,945 --> 01:41:36,986
Where did you hide her?

1428
01:41:39,361 --> 01:41:40,403
Where?

1429
01:41:56,903 --> 01:41:59,736
There's a skeleton
in the trunk of the cab.

1430
01:42:02,902 --> 01:42:03,986
Is that her?

1431
01:42:08,736 --> 01:42:12,194
No, not this one.

1432
01:42:15,777 --> 01:42:16,944
I'll go upstairs.

1433
01:42:24,069 --> 01:42:25,444
There's another one here.

1434
01:42:26,652 --> 01:42:28,235
No, not this one either.

1435
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:37,360
What do you see?

1436
01:42:38,068 --> 01:42:38,985
Many wine jars.

1437
01:42:44,068 --> 01:42:45,151
Not this one.

1438
01:42:48,401 --> 01:42:50,276
How troublesome!

1439
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:51,943
I give up. Go find it yourself

1440
01:42:52,026 --> 01:42:53,235
They're all here.

1441
01:42:55,776 --> 01:42:56,818
Call for backup.

1442
01:43:05,568 --> 01:43:10,151
What's up?

1443
01:43:11,526 --> 01:43:12,443
Dinner time.

1444
01:43:12,526 --> 01:43:14,609
You've killed many people.

1445
01:43:17,151 --> 01:43:18,151
Did you pick up Minnie?

1446
01:43:20,026 --> 01:43:21,692
On June 20, 1997,

1447
01:43:22,276 --> 01:43:24,776
did you pick up a young girl
wearing a school uniform

1448
01:43:24,859 --> 01:43:28,901
and a pair of red shoes in Kowloon Tong?

1449
01:43:30,567 --> 01:43:31,859
The dishes have turned cold.

1450
01:43:32,859 --> 01:43:36,859
I'm very hungry.

1451
01:43:38,109 --> 01:43:38,984
Where's Minnie?

1452
01:43:44,358 --> 01:43:45,567
You have very beautiful eyes.

1453
01:45:16,148 --> 01:45:17,273
May Wong,

1454
01:45:19,731 --> 01:45:20,773
help me.

1455
01:45:48,064 --> 01:45:49,439
You're indeed my idol.

1456
01:45:50,481 --> 01:45:52,356
Your marksmanship is excellent
despite your blindness.

1457
01:45:54,147 --> 01:45:55,231
Thank you.

1458
01:45:59,147 --> 01:46:00,147
Are you okay?

1459
01:46:01,022 --> 01:46:02,147
Cut the crap.

1460
01:46:07,980 --> 01:46:09,022
Is it serious?

1461
01:46:09,522 --> 01:46:14,147
My waist, I feel dizzy.

1462
01:46:24,730 --> 01:46:26,147
I can't drive.

1463
01:46:34,896 --> 01:46:38,646
No signals.

1464
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:42,021
I'll drive.

1465
01:46:54,188 --> 01:46:55,271
To your left.

1466
01:46:58,687 --> 01:46:59,687
Your right.

1467
01:47:19,395 --> 01:47:20,354
Hang on!

1468
01:47:20,604 --> 01:47:23,020
Don't fall asleep. Stay awake.

1469
01:47:32,145 --> 01:47:35,770
I never thought
that I would die in this way.

1470
01:47:37,395 --> 01:47:38,312
Hey!

1471
01:47:38,853 --> 01:47:41,103
Do you have something to tell me?

1472
01:47:41,770 --> 01:47:42,811
Don't you like me?

1473
01:47:45,061 --> 01:47:51,395
You knew? How embarrassing.
I should die faster.

1474
01:47:51,561 --> 01:47:53,853
Nonsense. There's no need
to be embarrassed.

1475
01:47:54,478 --> 01:47:55,561
I suddenly realized...

1476
01:48:00,436 --> 01:48:01,478
I suddenly realized

1477
01:48:02,186 --> 01:48:03,269
that I love you too.

1478
01:48:05,978 --> 01:48:07,853
But I look like Susan.

1479
01:48:09,103 --> 01:48:10,894
I'm blind anyway.

1480
01:48:13,227 --> 01:48:16,186
You'll lose face in front of your friends.

1481
01:48:16,769 --> 01:48:19,852
I don't have any friend,
I've only got one,

1482
01:48:20,644 --> 01:48:22,977
that Szeto bastard.

1483
01:48:23,769 --> 01:48:27,060
You love me

1484
01:48:27,769 --> 01:48:29,394
just because I am rich.

1485
01:48:30,310 --> 01:48:31,685
I love your wealth all right.

1486
01:48:32,352 --> 01:48:33,894
But I also love everything else about you!

1487
01:48:34,769 --> 01:48:36,102
Even if you're penniless.

1488
01:48:41,352 --> 01:48:42,435
Johnston,

1489
01:48:43,310 --> 01:48:46,810
I didn't get "Forever Valentino"
tattooed on my shoulder.

1490
01:48:47,977 --> 01:48:52,143
I got "I Love Johnston" tattooed instead.

1491
01:48:53,935 --> 01:48:56,601
How gross. It'll be there for
the rest of your life.

1492
01:48:57,518 --> 01:49:00,143
That's nice.

1493
01:49:14,351 --> 01:49:15,268
Don't sleep!

1494
01:49:16,434 --> 01:49:18,393
It's for life!

1495
01:49:25,434 --> 01:49:27,017
- Do you know how to drive?
- Are you blind?

1496
01:49:27,101 --> 01:49:29,642
- You're so reckless. You scared us.
- Can't you see all these cars?

1497
01:49:31,767 --> 01:49:33,726
Help!

1498
01:49:34,809 --> 01:49:36,684
Call the police!

1499
01:49:52,892 --> 01:49:54,100
Hey, is the operation over?

1500
01:49:57,850 --> 01:49:59,475
- We didn't find the young girl.
- What?

1501
01:50:00,433 --> 01:50:01,683
Minnie wasn't there?

1502
01:50:02,058 --> 01:50:03,683
We found ten skeletons at the crime scene.

1503
01:50:03,767 --> 01:50:05,725
All victims were proved
to be female adults.

1504
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,558
That is to say, Minnie's not among them

1505
01:50:07,642 --> 01:50:08,558
Impossible.

1506
01:50:08,933 --> 01:50:10,100
Did you search thoroughly?

1507
01:50:10,183 --> 01:50:12,141
Yes, we searched every corner.

1508
01:50:12,225 --> 01:50:13,725
Why are you so sure?

1509
01:50:16,475 --> 01:50:19,141
I told you
I didn't have any cash for the taxi.

1510
01:50:20,141 --> 01:50:21,141
Where did I go wrong?

1511
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:23,766
It's not Chan Kwong.

1512
01:50:24,016 --> 01:50:26,349
How about Joe? Did he kill me?

1513
01:50:32,016 --> 01:50:32,891
How is she?

1514
01:50:32,974 --> 01:50:34,474
The doctor said the operation went well.

1515
01:50:35,058 --> 01:50:35,933
Thank you, miss.

1516
01:50:39,099 --> 01:50:40,182
What's wrong?

1517
01:50:41,307 --> 01:50:42,391
I'm fucked up.

1518
01:50:43,182 --> 01:50:44,766
I was so desperate that I told her

1519
01:50:46,057 --> 01:50:47,141
I love her.

1520
01:50:47,932 --> 01:50:48,849
She doesn't love you?

1521
01:50:48,932 --> 01:50:50,016
Shut up!

1522
01:50:50,141 --> 01:50:51,266
She loves every inch of me

1523
01:50:51,432 --> 01:50:52,724
from the very beginning.

1524
01:50:52,807 --> 01:50:54,057
Congratulations.

1525
01:50:54,140 --> 01:50:55,432
Too bad she looks like Susan.

1526
01:50:55,765 --> 01:50:56,682
Which Susan?

1527
01:50:56,765 --> 01:50:58,432
Officer Susan in Kowloon West District.

1528
01:50:58,515 --> 01:51:00,807
The woman who looks like a man.

1529
01:51:00,974 --> 01:51:03,474
You're blind, buddy! What's your problem?

1530
01:51:03,557 --> 01:51:04,557
That's what I thought.

1531
01:51:04,849 --> 01:51:06,349
But you know, medical advancement

1532
01:51:06,474 --> 01:51:08,349
may one day cure my blindness.

1533
01:51:08,723 --> 01:51:10,140
How can I look at her?

1534
01:51:11,098 --> 01:51:14,015
Come here.

1535
01:51:14,223 --> 01:51:18,223
Touch her.

1536
01:51:18,515 --> 01:51:20,015
You're crazy! No!

1537
01:51:20,098 --> 01:51:22,432
- I don't want to find out.
- Trust me, man.

1538
01:52:02,472 --> 01:52:03,514
I know where I went wrong.

1539
01:52:04,347 --> 01:52:05,389
Where?

1540
01:52:07,514 --> 01:52:08,555
I was wrong about you.

1541
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:13,889
You didn't take a taxi.
You went on a ship.

1542
01:52:14,722 --> 01:52:16,389
You've finally realized.

1543
01:52:30,805 --> 01:52:31,680
Hello?

1544
01:52:31,972 --> 01:52:33,180
<i>Johnston.</i>

1545
01:52:33,847 --> 01:52:34,972
Have you woken up?

1546
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:36,847
<i>Does it still hurt?</i>

1547
01:52:37,721 --> 01:52:40,221
<i>A little bit. Where are you?</i>

1548
01:52:40,763 --> 01:52:42,180
Sorry, I was on the wrong track.

1549
01:52:42,930 --> 01:52:44,721
Chan Kwong didn't kill Minnie.

1550
01:52:45,930 --> 01:52:47,055
But I have new clues,

1551
01:52:47,138 --> 01:52:49,138
I'm going to find Joe
and ask him something.

1552
01:52:49,888 --> 01:52:51,305
What? You're going alone?

1553
01:52:51,805 --> 01:52:52,971
<i>Don't worry.</i>

1554
01:52:53,888 --> 01:52:54,846
Rest well.

1555
01:52:54,929 --> 01:52:56,013
I'll have good news for you.

1556
01:52:58,929 --> 01:53:00,013
What did you say?

1557
01:53:00,596 --> 01:53:02,096
I'm going to find Joe.

1558
01:53:02,179 --> 01:53:03,179
Not that,

1559
01:53:03,263 --> 01:53:04,388
I mean, your last sentence.

1560
01:53:09,762 --> 01:53:10,596
Bye-bye.

1561
01:53:11,137 --> 01:53:12,054
Bye-bye.

1562
01:53:20,721 --> 01:53:22,179
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1563
01:53:22,470 --> 01:53:24,345
<i>welcome aboard the Cotai Water Jet.</i>

1564
01:53:24,512 --> 01:53:27,679
<i>We'll arrive in Zhuhai in 75 minutes.</i>

1565
01:53:42,137 --> 01:53:45,053
I've found out that you lied.

1566
01:53:45,428 --> 01:53:47,845
The truth is...

1567
01:53:48,345 --> 01:53:50,720
Minnie kept pestering you,
so you killed her

1568
01:53:54,303 --> 01:53:55,720
and dismembered her, right?

1569
01:53:59,261 --> 01:54:01,136
RAT POISON

1570
01:54:08,261 --> 01:54:10,053
<i>The number you have dialed
is cannot be reached.</i>

1571
01:54:12,553 --> 01:54:14,678
Mr. Johnston, add some black pepper.

1572
01:54:15,178 --> 01:54:16,428
It will be more delicious.

1573
01:54:16,511 --> 01:54:17,594
Go ahead.

1574
01:54:17,678 --> 01:54:18,719
Oh, my goodness!

1575
01:54:31,177 --> 01:54:34,052
It hurts.

1576
01:54:41,802 --> 01:54:43,927
It hurts.

1577
01:54:44,302 --> 01:54:46,177
But it really tastes good.

1578
01:54:49,010 --> 01:54:50,927
I'll die for it.

1579
01:54:57,385 --> 01:55:00,302
Get out of my way!

1580
01:55:05,552 --> 01:55:06,676
Anybody here?

1581
01:55:27,593 --> 01:55:28,676
Excuse me.

1582
01:55:29,259 --> 01:55:30,468
Anybody here?

1583
01:55:33,843 --> 01:55:34,884
Is Joe here?

1584
01:55:40,092 --> 01:55:40,967
Hello?

1585
01:55:41,634 --> 01:55:43,051
My name is Johnston.

1586
01:55:44,259 --> 01:55:46,842
I'm looking for Joe. Is he in?

1587
01:56:03,175 --> 01:56:04,134
He's not here.

1588
01:56:05,925 --> 01:56:07,217
I had a fight with him.

1589
01:56:09,425 --> 01:56:10,467
He ran away with that woman.

1590
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:15,800
I want to confirm something.

1591
01:56:17,717 --> 01:56:18,842
You can probably help me.

1592
01:56:19,508 --> 01:56:20,466
I'm in a bad mood.

1593
01:56:24,758 --> 01:56:25,633
Please leave.

1594
01:56:25,925 --> 01:56:26,800
In that case,

1595
01:56:27,675 --> 01:56:29,341
may I have a glass of water?

1596
01:56:40,341 --> 01:56:42,299
Sake is better. Thank you.

1597
01:57:08,924 --> 01:57:09,840
Thank you.

1598
01:57:15,049 --> 01:57:18,549
I analyze a case by imagining myself
as the characters,

1599
01:57:19,590 --> 01:57:20,548
then making deductions.

1600
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:23,340
Listen to this story

1601
01:57:24,048 --> 01:57:25,257
and see if I guessed right.

1602
01:57:42,381 --> 01:57:44,798
<i>Minnie was afraid she would never see
a certain boy again.</i>

1603
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:47,715
<i>She didn't even know
where to look for him.</i>

1604
01:57:49,631 --> 01:57:50,923
But she did not give up.

1605
01:57:51,756 --> 01:57:54,881
She told herself she must stay strong.

1606
01:57:55,714 --> 01:57:56,923
<i>Stay strong.</i>

1607
01:58:54,421 --> 01:58:55,713
<i>She never thought</i>

1608
01:58:57,171 --> 01:58:58,880
she would be hiding
in the closet for 27 days

1609
01:59:17,296 --> 01:59:18,629
and end up in Brazil.

1610
01:59:20,337 --> 01:59:24,087
But she knew if she showed up
in front of the boy,

1611
01:59:24,671 --> 01:59:25,796
she would only

1612
01:59:27,296 --> 01:59:28,504
<i>scare him off.</i>

1613
01:59:30,546 --> 01:59:31,962
<i>So she left.</i>

1614
01:59:33,545 --> 01:59:38,795
She got adopted by the locals
and changed her name.

1615
01:59:40,170 --> 01:59:43,337
But she always stayed near the boy

1616
01:59:45,545 --> 01:59:47,170
She later changed her look
by plastic surgery

1617
01:59:48,628 --> 01:59:51,128
and succeeded in winning him back

1618
01:59:52,628 --> 01:59:56,045
But the man himself was unfaithful.

1619
01:59:57,670 --> 01:59:59,212
He had many affairs with other women.

1620
02:00:01,295 --> 02:00:03,003
No matter how hard Minnie tried,

1621
02:00:03,878 --> 02:00:05,878
the marriage still fell apart.

1622
02:00:08,878 --> 02:00:10,170
<i>VocÃª me trai,</i>

1623
02:00:11,211 --> 02:00:13,170
<i>vou perseguir vocÃª atÃ© a morte.</i>

1624
02:00:14,420 --> 02:00:16,711
This is a Portuguese saying, I've checked.

1625
02:00:18,419 --> 02:00:19,753
This is what it means in Cantonese,

1626
02:00:21,336 --> 02:00:22,544
"You betrayed me.

1627
02:00:23,628 --> 02:00:25,711
I'll make you suffer like hell."

1628
02:00:28,044 --> 02:00:31,919
These words were from your grandma.

1629
02:00:33,294 --> 02:00:36,377
But one must not be blinded
by stubbornness.

1630
02:00:38,961 --> 02:00:40,086
It can drive one to kill.

1631
02:00:44,502 --> 02:00:45,752
Your mother was an example of that.

1632
02:00:47,877 --> 02:00:49,002
Same with your grandma.

1633
02:00:51,252 --> 02:00:52,794
You resemble your grandma too much.

1634
02:00:55,044 --> 02:00:58,794
I came not only for the truth,

1635
02:01:10,127 --> 02:01:11,710
but to ask you to let go.

1636
02:01:21,751 --> 02:01:22,876
I guess I'm wrong again

1637
02:01:24,001 --> 02:01:26,335
I should go home and study more.

1638
02:01:26,668 --> 02:01:28,043
I'll go now. Thank you.

1639
02:01:28,460 --> 02:01:29,460
No need to see me out.

1640
02:01:30,251 --> 02:01:31,959
Thank you for the sake. Thank you.

1641
02:01:37,501 --> 02:01:38,334
Help me!

1642
02:01:38,626 --> 02:01:40,793
She's lying. Ignore her.

1643
02:01:41,293 --> 02:01:42,709
Help me!

1644
02:01:45,293 --> 02:01:47,334
My water just broke!

1645
02:01:47,959 --> 02:01:49,209
Help!

1646
02:02:02,834 --> 02:02:05,709
Calm down, take a deep breath.

1647
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,209
Take a deep breath.

1648
02:02:12,667 --> 02:02:13,834
Come on!

1649
02:02:18,125 --> 02:02:19,208
Johnston?

1650
02:02:19,583 --> 02:02:20,458
Johnston!

1651
02:02:25,583 --> 02:02:26,500
Help!

1652
02:02:26,583 --> 02:02:27,667
Murder! Ho!

1653
02:02:27,750 --> 02:02:29,167
- Murder!
- I'm coming!

1654
02:02:33,208 --> 02:02:36,916
Help!

1655
02:02:39,625 --> 02:02:41,583
Help me, Ho!

1656
02:02:48,208 --> 02:02:49,916
Ho!

1657
02:02:58,999 --> 02:03:00,208
Johnston!

1658
02:03:03,041 --> 02:03:06,291
Johnston!

1659
02:03:06,957 --> 02:03:07,957
The baby...

1660
02:03:11,041 --> 02:03:12,957
- Johnston!
- Save the baby.

1661
02:03:15,957 --> 02:03:17,249
She's Minnie.

1662
02:03:17,874 --> 02:03:18,749
Minnie?

1663
02:03:26,249 --> 02:03:27,707
Minnie!

1664
02:03:29,332 --> 02:03:30,623
Hang on there, Minnie!

1665
02:03:30,915 --> 02:03:31,790
Hang on!

1666
02:03:31,873 --> 02:03:32,790
Push!

1667
02:03:33,123 --> 02:03:33,957
Sit up!

1668
02:03:34,040 --> 02:03:36,415
Sit up!

1669
02:03:36,498 --> 02:03:37,915
Push!

1670
02:03:37,998 --> 02:03:40,498
Minnie, push harder!

1671
02:03:42,582 --> 02:03:48,581
Okay, one, two, three. Push!

1672
02:03:49,623 --> 02:03:51,665
Deep breath. Do it again.

1673
02:03:51,748 --> 02:03:57,790
One, two, three, push!

1674
02:03:57,873 --> 02:03:59,581
Great!

1675
02:03:59,665 --> 02:04:01,831
Harder!

1676
02:04:01,914 --> 02:04:02,873
It's coming.

1677
02:04:02,956 --> 02:04:04,081
The baby is coming.

1678
02:04:04,164 --> 02:04:05,456
It's coming.

1679
02:04:35,872 --> 02:04:36,955
Johnston!

1680
02:04:38,414 --> 02:04:39,455
Johnston!

1681
02:04:45,205 --> 02:04:51,247
Johnston!

1682
02:04:56,872 --> 02:04:58,747
Is it a boy or a girl?

1683
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:07,705
Johnston! It's a girl.

1684
02:05:13,621 --> 02:05:15,704
A little Minnie.

1685
02:05:27,288 --> 02:05:28,996
I don't want strawberry flavor.

1686
02:05:29,079 --> 02:05:30,621
I want mango flavor.

1687
02:05:31,037 --> 02:05:33,246
Mango flavor is sold out.
Don't be stubborn.

1688
02:05:33,371 --> 02:05:35,037
I want mango!

1689
02:05:35,412 --> 02:05:36,996
Be a good girl, Little Minnie

1690
02:05:37,079 --> 02:05:40,329
Mommy will buy you
mango ice cream later, okay?

1691
02:05:40,787 --> 02:05:41,912
I'm disciplining my daughter!

1692
02:05:44,329 --> 02:05:45,995
Big Foot!

1693
02:05:54,454 --> 02:05:56,204
Honey, be careful.

1694
02:05:59,495 --> 02:06:00,412
Uncle Szeto.

1695
02:06:00,745 --> 02:06:02,620
I've found Big Foot.

1696
02:06:02,995 --> 02:06:04,328
Moody Road in Tsimshatsui East.

1697
02:06:04,412 --> 02:06:05,328
Say "thank you."

1698
02:06:05,870 --> 02:06:08,736
Moody Road. Come quickly. Thanks.

1699
02:06:22,982 --> 02:06:24,435
If you don't want to eat it, Daddy will.

1700
02:06:24,685 --> 02:06:26,387
You must not eat someone else's ice cream.

1701
02:06:27,343 --> 02:06:28,340
Then eat it.

1702
02:06:28,713 --> 02:06:30,707
No! I don't like strawberry!

1703
02:06:30,790 --> 02:06:32,368
I want mango!
