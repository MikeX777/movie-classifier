1
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:25,898
Nothing!

2
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,528
Keep looking.

3
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:32,202
Where's Yukihira?

4
00:01:32,372 --> 00:01:33,669
Don't know.

5
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:35,997
Figures.

6
00:01:46,552 --> 00:01:49,544
Yukihira, where are you?

7
00:01:49,756 --> 00:01:52,486
<i>I found what you wanted.</i>

8
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:55,925
Copy

9
00:01:56,062 --> 00:01:57,359
Nishimura?

10
00:01:58,464 --> 00:02:00,432
You're under arrest.

11
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:04,333
Nishimura!

12
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:11,407
Stay with him.

13
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:15,738
Yukihira, give me back up!

14
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:16,712
<i>Copy.</i>

15
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,680
"Drop your weapon"?

16
00:02:58,224 --> 00:02:59,885
Drop your weapon!

17
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:38,792
Sorry. I get impatient.

18
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:42,833
And I wanted him alive.

19
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,502
Look after Nishimura.

20
00:03:53,613 --> 00:03:54,978
So tell me...

21
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:59,714
how'd you know the chip
was in a wine case?

22
00:03:59,852 --> 00:04:03,413
The company chairman
is a wine buff.

23
00:04:04,524 --> 00:04:07,652
He gives it to all his clients.

24
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:11,863
I got his secretary drunk.

25
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:16,724
That's all you had?

26
00:04:16,869 --> 00:04:20,669
And a drinker's hunch.

27
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:24,400
Drinker's hunch, huh?

28
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:30,543
Shall I use it to predict what
you're going to say next?

29
00:04:30,683 --> 00:04:31,980
Shoot.

30
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:38,550
"Luck is the only reason
you're still alive today."

31
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:42,688
"We don't need loose cannons."
Right?

32
00:04:43,496 --> 00:04:46,329
You're in Public Security now.

33
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:48,329
Our motto is different

34
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:49,196
What's that?

35
00:04:51,437 --> 00:04:55,771
"All's well that ends well"...
or something.

36
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,779
<i>So? You find it?</i>

37
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:09,920
Don't rush me.

38
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:16,225
Are you even working?

39
00:05:16,362 --> 00:05:19,160
<i>Like there's no tomorrow</i>.

40
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,728
This is very important
to me, Kaoru

41
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:31,134
What makes you so sure
there is a hidden file?

42
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:35,641
I'm sure It's there.

43
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:39,175
Evidence of internal corruption.

44
00:05:39,552 --> 00:05:43,283
You're not worried you're
digging too deep?

45
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,159
Why do you say that?
You know something?

46
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:55,160
Hurry or you'll be late.

47
00:05:56,068 --> 00:05:58,127
Sorry Maki, go on ahead.

48
00:05:59,005 --> 00:05:59,972
Maki?

49
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:01,334
<i>The sitter.</i>

50
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:03,066
See you later

51
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:04,733
Bye, Mom.

52
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:10,008
My ex is in New York
The sitter's driving Mio to school.

53
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:13,785
<i>Bad idea. I advise against cars</i>.

54
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:17,283
What're you talking about?
Can you find it or not?

55
00:06:18,457 --> 00:06:20,482
Not

56
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:24,789
You know! 'm not good at
this kind of thing.

57
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:29,227
<i>If only we had Hasumi.</i>

58
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:30,629
What?

59
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,933
<i>It'd be nothing for her</i>.

60
00:06:35,341 --> 00:06:38,674
Whatever. I'm coming over

61
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:15,777
Somebody call an ambulance!

62
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:18,678
Hurry!

63
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:26,288
Mio!

64
00:07:32,565 --> 00:07:37,127
<i>The world doesn't play fair</i>.

65
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,035
<i>If you want justice.</i>...

66
00:07:40,306 --> 00:07:43,036
<i>it's an eye for an eye</i>

67
00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:46,838
<i>Fire is best fought with fire</i>

68
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:57,218
UNFA! R: the movie

69
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:13,127
You must have some idea, Yukihira.

70
00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:16,471
Who wants you dead?

71
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:19,571
I don't know.

72
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:21,509
You don't know.

73
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:25,913
A lot of people, no doubt.

74
00:08:28,354 --> 00:08:31,619
Wherever you go, you leave
a trail of bodies

75
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:35,618
Yet you always come out unscathed.

76
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:38,354
You're a piece of work

77
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:46,434
I truly pity the child that
has you for a mother.

78
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:56,638
Why?

79
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:14,993
Forgive me, Mio.

80
00:09:16,802 --> 00:09:18,497
Again.

81
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,944
It's all my fault.

82
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:39,117
Phone call, Ms. Yukihira.

83
00:09:57,343 --> 00:10:00,244
I'm Yukihira.
I have a call?

84
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:04,277
Hello?

85
00:10:04,417 --> 00:10:09,616
<i>The parents of that sitter who</i>
<i>died in your stead called.</i>

86
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:11,950
<i>From Kanto Hospital.</i>

87
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,890
I'm on my way

88
00:10:18,864 --> 00:10:22,265
Take good care of her.

89
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:24,833
Of course
Don't worry.

90
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:23,895
Hey!! It's party time!

91
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,207
Hurry, please!

92
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,278
What's happening?

93
00:11:42,414 --> 00:11:43,813
I don't know. Just evacuate.

94
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:58,954
Let's get you out of here.

95
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,563
Mio, I need you to hide here.

96
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:41,039
I'll be right back

97
00:13:09,835 --> 00:13:12,565
Listen up, people.

98
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:15,933
Your attention, please!

99
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:19,533
We've taken over this hospital.

100
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:25,507
You over there!

101
00:13:26,986 --> 00:13:31,047
Cooperate or you'll be dead

102
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:03,781
Secure the perimeter!
100 meters, no one gets in!

103
00:14:03,922 --> 00:14:06,049
Get me hospital schematics!

104
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:10,519
Party time.

105
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:20,699
Our daughter's gone because of you.

106
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:26,136
I'm so sorry.

107
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:32,913
Why wasn't it you?
You should be dead!

108
00:14:33,052 --> 00:14:35,020
Why?

109
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:53,035
Why'd you come?

110
00:14:56,608 --> 00:14:58,872
I'm your boss

111
00:15:03,582 --> 00:15:05,277
I think it's time...

112
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:10,483
I resigned.

113
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:19,353
I was so occupied with a phone
call this morning...

114
00:15:21,567 --> 00:15:24,798
I can't recall my daughter's face.

115
00:15:27,906 --> 00:15:31,672
Or if! even said good-bye.

116
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:38,005
I just don't remember.

117
00:15:42,187 --> 00:15:45,918
A large crowd of onlookers has
gathered around the hospital.

118
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:50,286
At 10 a. m, the Toyosu
Police Hospital...

119
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:54,522
<i>was occupied by an armed band</i>.

120
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:01,266
<i>Their exact number is unconfirmed,</i>
<i>their motives still unknown.</i>

121
00:16:01,473 --> 00:16:03,498
<i>Police are on the scene.</i>

122
00:16:03,642 --> 00:16:04,802
What is it?

123
00:16:04,943 --> 00:16:06,342
A standoff.

124
00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:12,710
Brief me on the Toyosu Police
Hospital situation.

125
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,778
Number of hostages?

126
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,617
You're not sure?

127
00:16:20,058 --> 00:16:20,888
Yukihira!

128
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:24,124
What's wrong?

129
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:26,322
My daughter's there.

130
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:27,460
What?

131
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:28,964
I'm sorry.

132
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:42,838
It's Saiki. Inspector Yukihira's
daughter is in the hospital.

133
00:16:47,085 --> 00:16:48,814
We're nearly set up.

134
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:50,645
Heard any demands?

135
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:53,622
Not yet
They're eerily silent

136
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:56,391
Are the schematics here?

137
00:16:56,628 --> 00:16:57,959
Schematics!

138
00:16:58,096 --> 00:16:59,563
Yes, Sir!

139
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,460
This is the Toyosu Police...

140
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:08,096
What's a medical examiner doing here?

141
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:11,208
My services may be needed.

142
00:17:11,343 --> 00:17:12,810
It's bad luck.

143
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,110
Sorry. As I was saying...

144
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:23,585
the Toyosu Police Hospital
is a state-of-the-art facility.

145
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:30,461
Every thing is run out of the central
control room underground.

146
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:33,861
It was built to resist a terrorist act.

147
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:37,761
With reinforced walls and
bulletproof windows

148
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:41,236
And monitored by a secure
police network.

149
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:47,006
One item hasn't been made public.

150
00:17:47,145 --> 00:17:52,139
The basement including the control room...

151
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:55,117
is a fully-equipped shelter

152
00:17:55,254 --> 00:17:58,621
Shelter? What do you mean?

153
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:05,222
In short, what we're facing gentlemen...

154
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:13,098
is a building that can double as
a highly defensible fortress.

155
00:18:13,438 --> 00:18:16,202
Chief Yamaji!
What's the status inside?

156
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:17,774
Hostages? Demands?

157
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,774
Why're you here?

158
00:18:18,911 --> 00:18:21,038
Mio's in there.

159
00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:25,676
Please... let me do something.

160
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:29,283
It's not your jurisdiction.

161
00:18:29,421 --> 00:18:30,217
I know but...

162
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:31,754
Let us handle it.

163
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,155
Sir, the hostages are being freed!

164
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:48,067
Why?

165
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:09,651
Mio.

166
00:19:10,862 --> 00:19:12,193
Mio!

167
00:19:13,198 --> 00:19:14,529
Sorry.

168
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:20,204
No pushing. Single file, please!

169
00:19:23,308 --> 00:19:26,903
A girl, 8 years old, Mio Sato.
Seen her?

170
00:19:27,045 --> 00:19:28,706
Mio Sato?

171
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,047
Not on my list yet.

172
00:19:37,189 --> 00:19:38,451
Thanks.

173
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:42,117
If you're not injured, we need your names.

174
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:44,358
Got a profile yet?

175
00:19:44,496 --> 00:19:49,934
From their attire and speech,
just a bunch of addled punks.

176
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:51,831
Should be quick

177
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,996
It's the Commissioner.

178
00:19:56,008 --> 00:19:57,703
You're kidding

179
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:04,310
<i>Yamaji here.</i>

180
00:20:05,017 --> 00:20:11,081
<i>All have been accounted for, save two</i>
<i>whose whereabouts remain unknown</i>.

181
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,723
<i>And the perpetrators inside?</i>

182
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,556
Still unconfirmed

183
00:20:17,696 --> 00:20:18,924
I need to speak with you, Sir

184
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:20,531
Yukihira,! 'm busy!

185
00:20:20,665 --> 00:20:22,428
- Hold it!
- Let go of me!

186
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:32,975
There's that female detective
we keep hearing about.

187
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:39,415
What about the two still missing?

188
00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:44,280
One is a nurse. The other is a young girl.

189
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:50,895
The daughter of Inspector Yukihira
Her name is Mio.

190
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:56,490
<i>Have you heard any demands?</i>

191
00:20:56,635 --> 00:21:01,197
We've been trying to make contact
but they haven't responded.

192
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:06,444
They could be after drugs... or just crazy.

193
00:21:06,578 --> 00:21:08,273
<i>Their objective is...</i>

194
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:10,809
Director Shinozaki.

195
00:21:11,983 --> 00:21:13,644
The Police Director?

196
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:16,879
<i>He's there for a check-up</i>
<i>under secret guard.</i>

197
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:19,991
Only a few know about it.

198
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:27,631
I want you to make his rescue your
top priority from here on out

199
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:33,329
His life's at stake, as is the honor of
the Metropolitan Police.

200
00:21:33,705 --> 00:21:35,400
Prepare a SAT insertion

201
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:42,804
With all due respect, Sir,
isn't that a bit risky?

202
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:45,472
<i>Yes, but inevitable.</i>

203
00:21:45,917 --> 00:21:50,718
<i>Civilians are out. We 're lucky the only</i>
<i>hostages are police related.</i>

204
00:21:50,922 --> 00:21:52,412
Now hold on!

205
00:21:52,557 --> 00:21:54,787
You need to leave.

206
00:21:54,926 --> 00:22:01,126
What're you saying? That you'd kill
my daughter to save face?

207
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:02,961
Is that what police do?

208
00:22:04,636 --> 00:22:06,160
Women.

209
00:22:07,205 --> 00:22:09,435
<i>Your orders, Sir?</i>

210
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:18,376
We haven't the luxury of time.

211
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:20,944
Send in SAT.

212
00:22:22,654 --> 00:22:24,246
Understood

213
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:31,522
Yukihira here

214
00:22:31,663 --> 00:22:34,757
They're sending in SAT.

215
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:37,831
Mio's not out yet.

216
00:22:38,236 --> 00:22:41,000
<i>Please, I need your help.</i>

217
00:22:41,806 --> 00:22:43,000
I beg you.

218
00:22:45,777 --> 00:22:47,142
Listen, Yukihira..

219
00:22:50,048 --> 00:22:54,246
! 'm truly sorry but...
there's nothing I can do.

220
00:23:25,717 --> 00:23:26,979
Sir...

221
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:31,347
results of Yukihira's car
bomb analysis

222
00:23:33,258 --> 00:23:34,520
Thanks.

223
00:23:45,737 --> 00:23:47,034
<i>I'm borrowing the car</i>.

224
00:23:50,075 --> 00:23:51,269
<i>Okay.</i>

225
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:04,445
Same method.

226
00:24:11,229 --> 00:24:15,256
The police have decided to
go in with force...

227
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:18,727
sending in a Special Assault Team.

228
00:24:20,338 --> 00:24:21,464
Stand down!

229
00:24:29,581 --> 00:24:31,776
<i>We've penetrated the central entrance.</i>

230
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:43,185
<i>B Team...</i>

231
00:24:44,996 --> 00:24:46,327
<i>C Team.</i>...

232
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:49,057
<i>Rendezvous at the</i>
<i>first level lobby</i>.

233
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,292
<i>Copy.</i>

234
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:51,595
<i>Copy.</i>

235
00:25:06,718 --> 00:25:09,414
Yoo-hoo, SAT boys!

236
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:17,524
It's a trap!

237
00:25:27,706 --> 00:25:31,233
An intense firefight has broken out!
Listen!

238
00:25:36,614 --> 00:25:38,104
Mio...

239
00:25:38,616 --> 00:25:39,674
Mio!

240
00:25:39,818 --> 00:25:40,512
Don't

241
00:25:44,055 --> 00:25:46,717
1st Squad, come in!

242
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:51,258
Commander Hikawa!

243
00:25:52,664 --> 00:25:54,256
Get me headquarters.

244
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,427
<i>We've lost communication</i>
<i>with 1st Squad.</i>

245
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:05,009
They were prepared.

246
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:07,668
Who are these guys?

247
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,579
Yukihira!

248
00:26:32,003 --> 00:26:34,904
Welcoming committee here.
Open the gate.

249
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:02,491
Welcome. We're honored to
have you here, Instructor.

250
00:27:02,634 --> 00:27:05,000
The insertion has been completed

251
00:27:05,136 --> 00:27:07,468
Good work, Commander Hikawa

252
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:08,572
Thank you.

253
00:27:08,706 --> 00:27:09,900
Status, Mr. Toda?

254
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:14,145
All secret police have been killed

255
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:18,147
All hostages have been released,
except for the Director

256
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:25,252
But we had to take the life of
one nurse who was witness.

257
00:27:27,058 --> 00:27:28,548
Toda...

258
00:27:29,461 --> 00:27:31,190
no more slip-ups.

259
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:34,195
Yes, Sir

260
00:27:34,432 --> 00:27:36,696
Let's get to work

261
00:28:36,594 --> 00:28:38,425
You're on.

262
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:03,982
Sir, still no movement inside.

263
00:29:12,997 --> 00:29:15,966
Forget it, Yukihira.
It's crazy.

264
00:29:16,267 --> 00:29:18,394
You can't fight these guys alone

265
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:23,268
I'm not going to fight them.
! 'm going to save Mio.

266
00:29:23,408 --> 00:29:24,875
Yukihira!

267
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:29,978
I've never tried to stop you before.

268
00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:31,473
But I am now.

269
00:29:31,616 --> 00:29:33,049
Listen to me!

270
00:29:33,184 --> 00:29:36,881
I've never been there for her

271
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,952
Never.

272
00:30:17,462 --> 00:30:18,190
<i>Open up</i>.

273
00:30:18,329 --> 00:30:19,318
Roger

274
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:25,801
I'm disengaging all security systems
to unlock the BSL4 Lab

275
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:31,827
Re-engaging security systems.

276
00:31:59,964 --> 00:32:03,058
The antiserum, Sir.

277
00:32:55,853 --> 00:32:56,615
Stay cool!

278
00:33:02,627 --> 00:33:03,355
Evacuate.

279
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:14,269
Evacuate!

280
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,882
Don't move!

281
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:33,286
The suit's torn!

282
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:37,094
Help!

283
00:33:38,062 --> 00:33:41,691
Help me, Sir!
I'm exposed!

284
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:46,365
Don't move. Just sit tight.

285
00:33:50,942 --> 00:33:52,842
Irrigate!

286
00:33:58,449 --> 00:34:00,212
Do something, please!

287
00:34:09,293 --> 00:34:14,026
What do we do, Sir?

288
00:34:35,853 --> 00:34:37,115
Sir.

289
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:41,684
Won't you inject me with the antiserum?

290
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,191
When we're finished.

291
00:34:51,903 --> 00:34:53,268
But, Sir!

292
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:57,933
I promise to return.

293
00:35:06,884 --> 00:35:08,579
I understand.

294
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:17,986
I'll wait

295
00:35:21,098 --> 00:35:22,895
Stop!

296
00:35:23,668 --> 00:35:24,862
Yukihira!

297
00:35:27,171 --> 00:35:30,163
! f you're going,
you need to calm down

298
00:35:30,508 --> 00:35:34,968
Otherwise, you'll only endanger
yourself and Mio.

299
00:35:37,682 --> 00:35:38,671
Got it?

300
00:35:50,027 --> 00:35:53,758
Why'd you warn me about
the car this morning?

301
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:56,058
Bad traffic.

302
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,827
Is that all?

303
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:00,565
Yeah

304
00:36:07,678 --> 00:36:11,580
They're making contact!

305
00:36:14,051 --> 00:36:15,416
Hook me up.

306
00:36:25,162 --> 00:36:26,288
Yamaji here.

307
00:36:29,633 --> 00:36:31,863
Get me Saiki of Public Security

308
00:36:32,269 --> 00:36:33,861
Saiki?

309
00:36:34,672 --> 00:36:37,232
What for?! 'm in charge.

310
00:36:38,476 --> 00:36:41,639
I'll negotiate only with him.

311
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:56,019
What's our move?

312
00:37:03,467 --> 00:37:06,527
Call Saiki. Get him over there.

313
00:37:47,778 --> 00:37:48,938
Wait.

314
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:50,846
Hold this

315
00:38:10,134 --> 00:38:12,364
Aren't you glad I came?

316
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,441
Voice analysis?

317
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:27,543
Working on it

318
00:38:27,985 --> 00:38:30,886
Focus on people I've been
involved with.

319
00:38:32,356 --> 00:38:37,760
Someone with an axe to
grind against you?

320
00:38:38,028 --> 00:38:42,055
Most crimes are money or
grudge inspired, right?

321
00:38:43,767 --> 00:38:45,997
A friend of yours, huh?

322
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:50,102
Let's find out.
Patch me through

323
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:53,533
Incoming call

324
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:55,071
On speaker

325
00:38:57,882 --> 00:38:59,008
Who's there?

326
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:00,616
<i>Saiki.</i>

327
00:39:01,685 --> 00:39:03,312
<i>Here are our demands</i>.

328
00:39:03,454 --> 00:39:05,046
Wait a second

329
00:39:05,689 --> 00:39:09,455
I don't like talking to strangers

330
00:39:11,762 --> 00:39:13,286
Who are you?

331
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,395
Who the hell are you?

332
00:39:18,536 --> 00:39:19,730
<i>I don't plan on staying.</i>

333
00:39:21,438 --> 00:39:24,100
Okay Then why me?

334
00:39:26,544 --> 00:39:30,446
I hear you're the least tainted

335
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:36,686
Fine

336
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:40,322
What do you want?

337
00:39:42,026 --> 00:39:48,659
8 billion yen's worth of illicit
police slush funds.

338
00:39:50,634 --> 00:39:52,226
8 billion?

339
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:54,769
Money that "doesn't" exist

340
00:39:55,372 --> 00:39:58,671
So it shouldn't be missed.
You have 2 hours

341
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:02,370
Or the Director dies.

342
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,621
<i>What 8 billion?</i>

343
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:26,870
Did you find the hidden files?

344
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:30,466
Sorry. No luck

345
00:40:32,243 --> 00:40:37,203
But you're talking about
a government secret right?

346
00:40:37,781 --> 00:40:41,945
How'd you hear about it?

347
00:40:42,853 --> 00:40:47,756
In clues to my father's death.
He was looking for it.

348
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:55,657
<i>There's no such slush fund!</i>
<i>It's a ruse by the perpetrator.</i>

349
00:40:56,066 --> 00:40:59,968
You're absolutely sure, then?

350
00:41:00,104 --> 00:41:01,799
Don't make me repeat myself!

351
00:41:03,907 --> 00:41:08,674
Slush fund or not...

352
00:41:09,713 --> 00:41:11,681
how should we proceed?

353
00:41:11,882 --> 00:41:14,817
Shall we prepare the ransom?

354
00:41:14,952 --> 00:41:16,852
We can't produce what doesn't exist.

355
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:26,252
Commissioner?

356
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:31,692
Give an order, Sir

357
00:41:33,871 --> 00:41:39,207
Don't comply. Send in the second
SAT squad.

358
00:41:39,343 --> 00:41:40,037
<i>Negative.</i>

359
00:41:40,177 --> 00:41:44,739
They took out the entire first squad.
They'll be ready.

360
00:41:44,882 --> 00:41:48,511
<i>We don't bargain with terrorists.</i>

361
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,780
Then you'll kill the Director

362
00:41:51,121 --> 00:41:55,353
He, too, would choose death
over acquiescence.

363
00:41:57,227 --> 00:41:59,889
Almost sounds like you want him dead

364
00:42:00,698 --> 00:42:06,432
You're next in succession, Mr Irie.

365
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:10,599
That's insubordination.
Watch yourself.

366
00:42:16,146 --> 00:42:17,238
<i>Forgive me</i>.

367
00:42:21,885 --> 00:42:23,216
Roger

368
00:42:24,788 --> 00:42:28,189
2nd SAT team's coming.
From the sewer system.

369
00:42:31,228 --> 00:42:32,991
We'll take up positions.

370
00:42:47,945 --> 00:42:50,106
They're sitting ducks.

371
00:42:56,286 --> 00:42:57,913
Chief Yamaji...

372
00:43:00,157 --> 00:43:03,649
have you seen Yukihira?

373
00:43:04,294 --> 00:43:06,421
Not since she left.

374
00:43:10,901 --> 00:43:13,836
I didn't expect you to oppose
the insertion.

375
00:43:15,672 --> 00:43:17,833
I hate waste.

376
00:43:19,743 --> 00:43:21,267
Waste, huh?

377
00:43:24,014 --> 00:43:26,380
So what's Saiki like?

378
00:43:26,517 --> 00:43:27,950
Why do you ask?

379
00:43:28,652 --> 00:43:31,086
No reason.

380
00:43:34,191 --> 00:43:38,628
The "all's well that ends well" type.
That's all I know.

381
00:43:39,129 --> 00:43:44,328
It's not like you to
not know anything.

382
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:07,957
Second SAT team.

383
00:44:12,763 --> 00:44:15,596
<i>It's under the command of</i>
<i>company leader Kojima</i>.

384
00:44:18,402 --> 00:44:20,427
Takeshi Kojima, huh?

385
00:44:56,507 --> 00:44:58,975
- Any sign they've emerged?
- Copy Team 2!

386
00:45:00,744 --> 00:45:04,236
<i>Team 2 immobilized Sir</i>.

387
00:45:20,764 --> 00:45:21,731
Hey!

388
00:45:41,885 --> 00:45:43,045
Yukihira...

389
00:45:53,363 --> 00:45:54,853
The first SAT team's alive

390
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:57,132
You don't suppose they did this.

391
00:45:57,267 --> 00:45:58,859
I think they did.

392
00:45:59,136 --> 00:46:01,036
It was an ambush.

393
00:46:03,507 --> 00:46:06,840
They knew what was coming

394
00:46:44,848 --> 00:46:46,213
Go right!

395
00:46:50,721 --> 00:46:51,813
This way!

396
00:46:54,858 --> 00:46:56,826
They'll catch up to us

397
00:46:58,061 --> 00:46:59,551
I'll draw them off.

398
00:46:59,696 --> 00:47:01,823
Don't be an idiot.

399
00:47:04,067 --> 00:47:05,125
Mio's waiting for you

400
00:47:11,274 --> 00:47:12,605
Thanks, Kaoru.

401
00:47:51,782 --> 00:47:53,079
Kaoru...

402
00:48:18,842 --> 00:48:20,503
Thank you.

403
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:31,751
Don't worry. My mommy
will come to get us.

404
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:36,916
I know she will.

405
00:49:32,082 --> 00:49:33,276
Mio.

406
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:39,282
Field command.

407
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:42,254
Yukihira's calling

408
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:49,958
Yukihira... where are you?

409
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,193
<i>Inside the hospital</i>.

410
00:49:54,538 --> 00:49:56,802
What happened to
the second SAT team?

411
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,100
<i>Wiped out.</i>

412
00:50:00,644 --> 00:50:04,410
<i>The first SAT team killed them.</i>

413
00:50:06,183 --> 00:50:07,207
Say what?

414
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:12,786
<i>The first team took out the second</i>
<i>in an ambush.</i>

415
00:50:13,924 --> 00:50:14,891
That would mean...

416
00:50:16,893 --> 00:50:21,421
Someone inside is tipping them off.

417
00:50:23,266 --> 00:50:25,063
<i>Someone inside?</i>

418
00:50:25,802 --> 00:50:27,667
Who's the traitor!?

419
00:50:46,089 --> 00:50:47,886
I'm in the basement

420
00:50:48,725 --> 00:50:53,753
Proceeding to room 602...
my daughter's room.

421
00:50:54,631 --> 00:50:56,292
<i>You alone?</i>

422
00:50:59,135 --> 00:51:00,159
Saiki?

423
00:51:00,537 --> 00:51:01,936
Be careful.

424
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,607
Gotta go.

425
00:51:19,219 --> 00:51:20,015
Sir!

426
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:24,150
Voice match

427
00:51:25,726 --> 00:51:26,420
Who is it?

428
00:51:26,827 --> 00:51:27,953
Kuniaki Goto.

429
00:51:28,095 --> 00:51:29,858
I should've guessed.

430
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:34,362
<i>Former SAT commander who</i>
<i>became police academy trainer.</i>

431
00:51:39,273 --> 00:51:41,207
January 1997.

432
00:51:41,642 --> 00:51:45,408
He retired soon after blowing
the whistle on...

433
00:51:45,546 --> 00:51:48,242
an internal embezzlement scandal.

434
00:51:48,382 --> 00:51:52,113
He then spent 8 years in prison for
what he says are trumped charges.

435
00:51:53,821 --> 00:51:58,190
He's out for revenge.

436
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,525
Who's the traitor?

437
00:52:40,797 --> 00:52:41,957
<i>Yukihira...</i>

438
00:52:42,565 --> 00:52:44,897
<i>Can you hear me?</i>
<i>It's me</i>.

439
00:52:51,241 --> 00:52:52,674
Kaoru?

440
00:52:52,809 --> 00:52:53,673
<i>Yeah.</i>

441
00:52:53,943 --> 00:52:55,877
You escaped.

442
00:52:56,145 --> 00:53:01,208
<i>Yeah... I got lucky.</i>

443
00:53:06,422 --> 00:53:08,913
<i>Where are you?</i>

444
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,257
<i>You find Mio?</i>

445
00:53:13,463 --> 00:53:17,126
She wasn't in her room.

446
00:53:20,136 --> 00:53:21,603
Where are you?

447
00:53:23,706 --> 00:53:24,798
<i>Basement.</i>

448
00:53:28,878 --> 00:53:32,678
Gotcha. Meet me in
the first floor lobby.

449
00:53:49,065 --> 00:53:52,967
Kaoru's the traitor.

450
00:53:53,303 --> 00:53:54,531
<i>Aren't you glad I came?</i>

451
00:54:02,045 --> 00:54:04,036
Kaoru's worthless

452
00:54:07,984 --> 00:54:09,349
Let's go

453
00:54:16,092 --> 00:54:19,789
Why's Hasumi with them?

454
00:54:22,632 --> 00:54:24,600
If she's in on it then...

455
00:54:24,834 --> 00:54:26,199
<i>Let us handle it.</i>

456
00:54:26,436 --> 00:54:28,131
<i>Send in the SAT team</i>.

457
00:54:28,271 --> 00:54:29,260
<i>Understood.</i>

458
00:54:34,844 --> 00:54:36,709
You worried?

459
00:54:38,147 --> 00:54:39,546
About what?

460
00:54:41,517 --> 00:54:42,950
Yukihira?

461
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:45,680
She'll live, I guarantee you

462
00:54:46,923 --> 00:54:49,858
There are no guarantees
in this world.

463
00:54:56,699 --> 00:54:58,360
You came up with Goto, right?

464
00:54:58,501 --> 00:54:59,525
So?

465
00:54:59,669 --> 00:55:00,761
Nothing.

466
00:55:03,473 --> 00:55:07,933
No one earned the loyalty
of his men like Goto.

467
00:55:08,878 --> 00:55:11,938
They called him the greatest
SAT leader ever.

468
00:55:14,817 --> 00:55:18,116
You find me suspect?

469
00:55:18,521 --> 00:55:23,083
No, but there's no doubt
about a traitor

470
00:55:23,226 --> 00:55:26,127
And you've another acquaintance
in there.

471
00:55:27,263 --> 00:55:29,094
Anna Hasumi

472
00:55:33,169 --> 00:55:34,761
We've got contact again

473
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:44,842
Time's up

474
00:55:45,248 --> 00:55:46,909
<i>We don't give in to terrorists</i>.

475
00:55:47,817 --> 00:55:48,943
<i>No ransom.</i>

476
00:55:53,289 --> 00:55:54,688
We're not paying the ransom.

477
00:55:55,491 --> 00:55:57,857
Then the Director dies

478
00:56:18,781 --> 00:56:20,578
I'm sure he would concur

479
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:22,317
I wonder about that.

480
00:56:24,387 --> 00:56:25,649
<i>Tell them that.</i>

481
00:56:28,491 --> 00:56:29,924
It's a death warrant.

482
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:31,219
Tell them!

483
00:56:31,761 --> 00:56:32,659
Well?

484
00:56:39,535 --> 00:56:41,093
We won't pay

485
00:56:41,604 --> 00:56:43,094
The Director would agree.

486
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:46,474
I see.

487
00:56:47,343 --> 00:56:48,674
In that case...

488
00:56:55,251 --> 00:56:56,809
Holy God!

489
00:57:03,025 --> 00:57:05,255
You won't see that money now!

490
00:57:12,435 --> 00:57:15,404
So you acknowledge its existence

491
00:57:18,708 --> 00:57:23,941
Without the Director,
you have no bargaining chip.

492
00:57:24,347 --> 00:57:28,340
Deposit 8 billion in a specified
account within 30 minutes

493
00:57:29,085 --> 00:57:31,553
Or we release anthrax
into the city.

494
00:57:34,323 --> 00:57:35,950
Say what?

495
00:57:36,092 --> 00:57:39,027
You have 30 minutes.

496
00:57:43,065 --> 00:57:46,125
Anthrax? Is he bluffing?

497
00:57:59,248 --> 00:58:03,685
The hospital has a bio weapons research lab.

498
00:58:04,787 --> 00:58:06,345
Mr Kimura?

499
00:58:06,522 --> 00:58:07,648
Yes, Sir

500
00:58:09,225 --> 00:58:14,185
There is an anthrax-like bacillus
that turns skin black

501
00:58:15,031 --> 00:58:18,990
The immune system has no chance.

502
00:58:20,236 --> 00:58:24,263
! t can spread by contact,
through airborne droplets.

503
00:58:24,473 --> 00:58:27,601
In short, from person to person.

504
00:58:29,245 --> 00:58:32,681
So how dangerous is it, exactly?

505
00:58:34,817 --> 00:58:37,445
If all of the stock were released...

506
00:58:38,487 --> 00:58:43,390
it would kill 80% of the Tokyo
population inside a week

507
00:58:43,593 --> 00:58:45,618
Is there a vaccine or antidote?

508
00:58:45,761 --> 00:58:49,663
There's antiserum enough for one
person inside the lab.

509
00:58:49,799 --> 00:58:54,759
And another supply stored elsewhere
for government leaders.

510
00:58:55,071 --> 00:58:58,507
That's all there is, I'm afraid.

511
01:00:51,353 --> 01:00:52,547
Mio!

512
01:01:00,996 --> 01:01:02,020
Mama

513
01:01:44,006 --> 01:01:45,473
Mio!

514
01:01:45,908 --> 01:01:47,432
Mama

515
01:02:03,125 --> 01:02:06,617
I waited for you.

516
01:02:08,297 --> 01:02:11,232
I knew you would come.

517
01:02:16,539 --> 01:02:22,500
Mama, will you help that
poor man?

518
01:02:23,946 --> 01:02:25,470
Poor man?

519
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:35,950
Where are you?

520
01:02:36,292 --> 01:02:37,850
The infection ward.

521
01:02:37,993 --> 01:02:39,984
Infection ward?

522
01:02:40,729 --> 01:02:41,855
Here.

523
01:02:42,164 --> 01:02:43,825
<i>Mio's inside.</i>

524
01:02:44,266 --> 01:02:48,202
With an apparently infected man.

525
01:02:48,337 --> 01:02:51,431
I see a torn hazmat suit.

526
01:02:51,774 --> 01:02:53,332
What?

527
01:02:56,912 --> 01:02:59,881
What sort of symptoms?
What's his skin like?

528
01:03:01,183 --> 01:03:02,650
His skin?

529
01:03:06,155 --> 01:03:07,782
Black and splotchy.

530
01:03:10,259 --> 01:03:11,317
Anthrax.

531
01:03:12,194 --> 01:03:14,162
<i>Come again?</i>

532
01:03:14,663 --> 01:03:17,097
<i>The pathogen the terrorists possess.</i>

533
01:03:17,499 --> 01:03:21,230
<i>They're threatening to release it</i>
<i>if demands aren't met</i>.

534
01:03:22,004 --> 01:03:23,062
Bioterror?

535
01:03:23,272 --> 01:03:24,796
And your daughter?

536
01:03:25,941 --> 01:03:27,067
How's Mio?

537
01:03:29,645 --> 01:03:31,010
She's...

538
01:03:44,293 --> 01:03:44,987
What?

539
01:03:52,835 --> 01:03:53,927
infected

540
01:03:58,874 --> 01:04:01,206
<i>Tell me, what does this mean?</i>

541
01:04:01,543 --> 01:04:04,671
It means she'll die in hours
without the antiserum.

542
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:09,618
Get me some immediately.

543
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:11,809
<i>Impossible</i>.

544
01:04:13,589 --> 01:04:14,283
Who's that?

545
01:04:15,257 --> 01:04:16,952
The Deputy Director.

546
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:24,065
We can't spare its use on a civilian
under the current terrorist threat.

547
01:04:25,634 --> 01:04:29,502
Well! 'm not going to let you
kill my daughter!

548
01:04:30,572 --> 01:04:32,733
<i>Inspector Yukihira.</i>...

549
01:04:34,143 --> 01:04:35,041
Commissioner?

550
01:04:35,477 --> 01:04:40,710
I want you to find the serum
and prevent the bioterror.

551
01:04:41,784 --> 01:04:45,845
Or everyone in Tokyo will meet
your daughter's fate.

552
01:04:47,256 --> 01:04:48,951
<i>That's right Yukihira.</i>

553
01:04:49,258 --> 01:04:52,022
The police cannot accommodate terrorists

554
01:04:52,328 --> 01:04:56,492
Help us... no, help the people of Tokyo.

555
01:04:56,799 --> 01:05:02,931
There's no time. With you inside,
you're our only hope.

556
01:05:03,706 --> 01:05:06,197
<i>First, secure the anthrax.</i>

557
01:05:06,742 --> 01:05:10,940
<i>Do that and I guarantee your</i>
<i>daughter will be saved.</i>

558
01:05:12,214 --> 01:05:13,545
<i>Promise me.</i>

559
01:05:15,884 --> 01:05:17,909
There's a leak

560
01:05:19,221 --> 01:05:24,215
I don't trust a word you say.

561
01:05:34,770 --> 01:05:36,237
I'm sorry...

562
01:05:38,707 --> 01:05:43,770
for everything I've put you through.

563
01:05:45,981 --> 01:05:47,972
That's okay

564
01:05:51,487 --> 01:05:53,512
When we get out of here...

565
01:05:56,358 --> 01:06:00,658
I'm going to quit my job...
and take care of you.

566
01:06:02,598 --> 01:06:05,123
I won't leave you alone again.

567
01:06:07,102 --> 01:06:13,166
Things will be different.
I'll be a good mom

568
01:06:14,276 --> 01:06:15,470
Okay?

569
01:06:21,583 --> 01:06:25,349
You are a good mom.

570
01:06:28,257 --> 01:06:32,819
You've always been a good mom.

571
01:06:35,764 --> 01:06:37,129
Mio...

572
01:06:41,503 --> 01:06:45,269
I love you very much.

573
01:06:50,746 --> 01:06:53,214
Look.

574
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,369
Happy birthday, Mom

575
01:07:22,544 --> 01:07:24,205
I completely forgot

576
01:07:26,215 --> 01:07:27,876
It's today, isn't it?

577
01:07:29,818 --> 01:07:34,915
I wanted to give it to you this morning.

578
01:07:42,598 --> 01:07:45,761
Don't quit your job.

579
01:07:50,372 --> 01:07:55,071
Go stop the bad guys

580
01:08:07,256 --> 01:08:08,621
Mio...

581
01:08:10,692 --> 01:08:12,284
hold on.

582
01:08:14,229 --> 01:08:16,197
I'm going to get you out of here

583
01:08:19,368 --> 01:08:21,063
I know.

584
01:08:27,442 --> 01:08:29,205
Okay, where's the poison?

585
01:08:29,344 --> 01:08:30,208
<i>Why?</i>

586
01:08:30,345 --> 01:08:33,212
I'm going to stop them and
save my daughter.

587
01:08:33,415 --> 01:08:35,212
But who can you trust?

588
01:08:36,018 --> 01:08:38,816
No one. Not even you.

589
01:08:39,388 --> 01:08:41,754
But give me direction.

590
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:45,417
And I'll know soon enough
if you're working against me.

591
01:08:45,761 --> 01:08:48,059
That's the girl I know.

592
01:08:49,531 --> 01:08:51,089
Can you leave Mio?

593
01:08:51,233 --> 01:08:52,860
She'll be fine.

594
01:08:54,136 --> 01:08:56,104
She's tougher than I am.

595
01:08:56,271 --> 01:08:58,171
<i>It's probably in the basement.</i>

596
01:09:06,615 --> 01:09:09,584
I've entered the Director's
retinal scan data.

597
01:09:09,718 --> 01:09:11,515
I've got his password.

598
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,089
Next is Deputy Director Irie.

599
01:09:15,557 --> 01:09:17,957
<i>Anthrax in place, Sir.</i>

600
01:10:33,769 --> 01:10:35,293
Nice try.

601
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:39,068
Yes?

602
01:10:39,207 --> 01:10:41,641
Ten minutes left.

603
01:10:42,077 --> 01:10:43,237
What's your decision?

604
01:10:43,378 --> 01:10:47,007
We're putting the money together.

605
01:10:47,149 --> 01:10:50,550
Good. You won't regret it

606
01:10:52,354 --> 01:10:53,787
The people come first.

607
01:10:53,922 --> 01:10:55,856
You mean "you" come first.

608
01:11:01,296 --> 01:11:02,854
That's enough

609
01:11:39,568 --> 01:11:40,967
You all right?

610
01:11:41,503 --> 01:11:42,868
Why're you here?

611
01:11:43,638 --> 01:11:50,134
Thought you might like some support.
From one loose cannon to another

612
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:55,249
Hurry. We've little time.

613
01:12:16,605 --> 01:12:20,541
How do you know it's here?

614
01:12:51,006 --> 01:12:54,237
So this is their ventilation.

615
01:12:56,745 --> 01:12:58,076
Yukihira!

616
01:13:02,284 --> 01:13:03,444
Found it.

617
01:13:09,658 --> 01:13:11,285
- Let's dismantle it.
- No!

618
01:13:12,828 --> 01:13:17,492
If we're not careful, it could be us
that poisons the city.

619
01:13:19,768 --> 01:13:20,894
What's your experience?

620
01:13:29,811 --> 01:13:33,338
Five minutes.
How's it coming?

621
01:13:34,716 --> 01:13:36,308
Have they found it yet?

622
01:14:04,112 --> 01:14:09,448
I take it you know who! am by now.

623
01:14:11,019 --> 01:14:12,111
Deputy! Irie?

624
01:14:13,722 --> 01:14:15,451
Kuniaki Goto.

625
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:17,487
Correct?

626
01:14:17,726 --> 01:14:18,988
<i>Yes.</i>

627
01:14:20,929 --> 01:14:22,590
<i>Been a while.</i>

628
01:14:26,768 --> 01:14:27,962
Why?

629
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:36,573
I spent eight years in prison
for a fabricated crime.

630
01:14:42,150 --> 01:14:48,146
Time I spent waiting for this day

631
01:14:54,229 --> 01:15:00,759
All because I planned to
expose police corruption...

632
01:15:03,204 --> 01:15:04,068
by you...

633
01:15:04,205 --> 01:15:05,433
Goto!

634
01:15:05,941 --> 01:15:12,847
<i>You and the Director owe me</i>.

635
01:15:14,015 --> 01:15:16,108
<i>Hurry and deposit the money.</i>

636
01:15:17,385 --> 01:15:22,448
<i>Or shall I disclose everything I know?</i>

637
01:15:30,098 --> 01:15:32,896
<i>You're going to make it.</i>

638
01:15:36,071 --> 01:15:38,266
How about you?

639
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:49,908
Yeah Let's hang in there, okay?

640
01:16:10,205 --> 01:16:15,370
Still suspicious of me, are you?

641
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:36,863
"Access granted"

642
01:16:48,777 --> 01:16:50,176
"Transfer funds?"

643
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,242
No deposit, Sir.

644
01:19:04,379 --> 01:19:05,869
Why not?

645
01:19:07,982 --> 01:19:09,609
And the anthrax?

646
01:19:10,251 --> 01:19:12,082
Signal's stopped.

647
01:19:14,422 --> 01:19:15,753
Something's wrong.

648
01:19:16,157 --> 01:19:17,317
Open the shelter!

649
01:19:17,592 --> 01:19:21,084
Opportunity knocks!
Let's move!

650
01:19:21,396 --> 01:19:23,159
B Team, move out!

651
01:19:24,699 --> 01:19:26,223
Here comes the cavalry.

652
01:19:41,983 --> 01:19:43,211
Yukihira!

653
01:19:47,322 --> 01:19:48,755
Plug your ears!

654
01:19:52,327 --> 01:19:53,385
Copy

655
01:19:55,697 --> 01:19:59,929
Five men down Intruder fleeing
with the bacteria.

656
01:20:00,101 --> 01:20:03,502
I think it's Yukihira.

657
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:07,507
You okay?

658
01:20:12,647 --> 01:20:14,877
<i>Natsumi Yukihira</i>...

659
01:20:17,385 --> 01:20:18,647
Let's make a trade.

660
01:20:20,054 --> 01:20:21,817
<i>Give me the bacteria.</i>

661
01:20:22,757 --> 01:20:25,021
And I'll give you the serum.

662
01:20:28,663 --> 01:20:30,858
You can't go!

663
01:20:31,099 --> 01:20:33,067
The serum

664
01:20:33,501 --> 01:20:37,597
Even with it, the moment you go
in without a biochemical suit...

665
01:20:37,739 --> 01:20:39,832
you'll be infected

666
01:20:41,109 --> 01:20:45,546
I don't care as long as
Mio is saved.

667
01:20:46,014 --> 01:20:48,847
You'll bleed to death before
you get there.

668
01:20:50,118 --> 01:20:53,451
Let me tend to that.

669
01:20:56,457 --> 01:20:58,584
I'm sorry to have to say...

670
01:21:04,832 --> 01:21:06,629
so long.

671
01:21:14,242 --> 01:21:18,008
Your mother...

672
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:23,681
will be here soon.

673
01:21:33,561 --> 01:21:34,721
Good-bye

674
01:21:39,968 --> 01:21:40,992
Let's go

675
01:22:28,416 --> 01:22:32,443
Your car explosion.
Any idea who did it?

676
01:22:35,723 --> 01:22:39,022
Were you investigating something
on your own?

677
01:22:43,297 --> 01:22:44,787
I'll take that as a "yes"

678
01:22:48,236 --> 01:22:53,902
I caught wind of some
hidden files...

679
01:22:55,910 --> 01:22:58,401
detailing internal corruption.

680
01:23:00,181 --> 01:23:02,741
And you plan to expose it?

681
01:23:05,987 --> 01:23:07,818
I'd think twice.

682
01:23:09,524 --> 01:23:11,082
Why?

683
01:23:13,027 --> 01:23:14,289
There, you're set

684
01:23:21,069 --> 01:23:26,974
Six years ago... I looked into a
secret slush fund at the MPD

685
01:23:29,043 --> 01:23:34,003
I got within an inch of finding
positive proof.

686
01:23:35,216 --> 01:23:36,843
And then it happened

687
01:23:39,387 --> 01:23:45,917
My fianc? got into my car
and it exploded

688
01:23:47,695 --> 01:23:49,526
Like Mio.

689
01:23:53,234 --> 01:23:55,464
Luckily, she survived.

690
01:23:57,071 --> 01:23:58,663
But...

691
01:24:00,041 --> 01:24:01,565
she was badly burned.

692
01:24:04,378 --> 01:24:06,073
In place of me

693
01:24:07,782 --> 01:24:09,443
<i>You did this to her.!</i>

694
01:24:14,989 --> 01:24:16,820
Give it up

695
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,518
It's not worth it.

696
01:24:28,436 --> 01:24:29,630
Yukihira!

697
01:24:46,521 --> 01:24:48,318
The bacteria.

698
01:24:51,159 --> 01:24:53,286
For the serum.

699
01:25:01,169 --> 01:25:02,761
Want to save your daughter?

700
01:25:06,607 --> 01:25:10,099
Hurry.
She's dying

701
01:25:12,513 --> 01:25:13,707
Yukihira...

702
01:25:16,184 --> 01:25:17,515
the bacteria.

703
01:25:19,754 --> 01:25:21,312
What?

704
01:25:22,657 --> 01:25:24,352
Mio's life is most important now.

705
01:25:45,446 --> 01:25:46,470
The antiserum.

706
01:26:08,836 --> 01:26:10,531
5-9-2-8.

707
01:26:10,671 --> 01:26:13,139
Access code to the infection ward.

708
01:26:30,758 --> 01:26:32,589
Go to Mio

709
01:26:33,461 --> 01:26:34,485
And you?

710
01:26:34,762 --> 01:26:36,423
I'll stop him

711
01:26:44,372 --> 01:26:48,775
<i>So where's the traitor?</i>

712
01:27:24,245 --> 01:27:25,507
What?

713
01:27:30,785 --> 01:27:34,016
So who're you after, huh?

714
01:27:34,388 --> 01:27:37,050
The police? Yukihira?

715
01:27:37,191 --> 01:27:39,785
I couldn't care less for either

716
01:27:39,927 --> 01:27:43,590
I just wanna get rich.

717
01:27:44,465 --> 01:27:47,093
People betray you. Money doesn't

718
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:52,194
Now! 'm free.
See ya

719
01:28:02,249 --> 01:28:04,274
"Fund transfer completed"

720
01:28:07,121 --> 01:28:08,816
It can't be.

721
01:28:19,967 --> 01:28:21,628
Find Hasumi!

722
01:28:27,675 --> 01:28:31,304
With the Director and Deputy's
security data...

723
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,142
all doors are open.

724
01:28:44,658 --> 01:28:46,626
Don't scare me like that.

725
01:28:50,798 --> 01:28:52,493
Your beloved files.

726
01:28:56,637 --> 01:29:00,630
Now give me my 4 billion

727
01:29:22,430 --> 01:29:23,954
Is that you, Saiki?

728
01:29:43,651 --> 01:29:46,245
Secret files?

729
01:29:48,055 --> 01:29:49,579
Right here.

730
01:29:49,723 --> 01:29:51,054
Let's see.

731
01:29:57,598 --> 01:29:58,997
You turning on me?

732
01:30:02,303 --> 01:30:04,498
I wouldn't say that.

733
01:30:06,173 --> 01:30:07,401
Just following the plan.

734
01:30:09,109 --> 01:30:09,973
How so?

735
01:30:12,146 --> 01:30:15,775
The "plan" calls for me
to have that.

736
01:30:18,953 --> 01:30:21,251
Isn't that right?

737
01:30:22,857 --> 01:30:28,523
! thought we were going public
with that... force the top to resign.

738
01:30:33,834 --> 01:30:40,569
What about our plans to create
an ideal police force?

739
01:30:42,443 --> 01:30:47,073
Isn't that what we did this for?

740
01:30:47,748 --> 01:30:50,717
What we sacrificed our own for?

741
01:31:03,230 --> 01:31:05,027
Forgive me, Goto.

742
01:31:34,862 --> 01:31:36,853
Justice demands a price.

743
01:31:41,936 --> 01:31:43,699
Saiki...

744
01:32:21,742 --> 01:32:23,403
Drop your weapons!

745
01:32:24,178 --> 01:32:26,271
It's all over!

746
01:32:47,134 --> 01:32:48,624
Seize them!

747
01:33:15,362 --> 01:33:19,924
This what you wanted, Yamaji?

748
01:33:23,671 --> 01:33:28,665
Well... is it?

749
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:40,382
Hold it!

750
01:34:12,586 --> 01:34:13,814
Gotcha.

751
01:35:10,544 --> 01:35:11,511
Mio!

752
01:35:16,617 --> 01:35:20,883
Mio, hold on!

753
01:35:21,822 --> 01:35:25,519
I'm here now. Everything's
gonna be fine

754
01:35:34,468 --> 01:35:36,026
It's all right.

755
01:35:36,703 --> 01:35:40,935
Thank God... Mio.

756
01:35:46,914 --> 01:35:48,541
Mom.

757
01:36:04,431 --> 01:36:05,523
Mio?

758
01:36:13,941 --> 01:36:15,636
Don't do this.

759
01:36:17,411 --> 01:36:21,507
Hang in there!

760
01:36:21,782 --> 01:36:24,580
Don't leave me.

761
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:28,547
Look at me!

762
01:36:30,524 --> 01:36:32,048
Please!

763
01:36:35,095 --> 01:36:38,531
Mio, look at me!
Open your eyes!

764
01:36:42,402 --> 01:36:44,097
Please!

765
01:36:46,473 --> 01:36:49,135
Come on, Mio!

766
01:36:50,143 --> 01:36:51,804
Please!

767
01:36:52,646 --> 01:36:54,546
Open your eyes!

768
01:36:56,216 --> 01:36:58,446
Don't do this to me!

769
01:37:08,195 --> 01:37:09,594
Please...

770
01:37:32,219 --> 01:37:33,686
Mom?

771
01:37:37,557 --> 01:37:38,888
Mio.

772
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:43,420
I waited for you.

773
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:40,342
I knew you'd come back.

774
01:39:51,825 --> 01:39:59,231
All's well that ends well.
! s that it, Saiki?

775
01:40:07,407 --> 01:40:09,841
How'd you know to come here?

776
01:40:10,544 --> 01:40:12,603
A drinker's hunch.

777
01:40:14,281 --> 01:40:15,748
Oh, that's right.

778
01:40:17,651 --> 01:40:19,585
How're you holding up?

779
01:40:19,753 --> 01:40:21,550
I'll live.

780
01:40:22,756 --> 01:40:24,849
The government's antiserum?

781
01:40:24,991 --> 01:40:27,482
It arrived in time.

782
01:40:28,061 --> 01:40:32,725
By your plan, I'd be dead from
anthrax by now

783
01:40:34,801 --> 01:40:36,098
Or would I?

784
01:40:38,972 --> 01:40:41,202
There are no absolutes in this world.

785
01:40:43,009 --> 01:40:46,308
No plan is ever perfect.

786
01:40:49,850 --> 01:40:51,613
But the truth is...

787
01:40:52,819 --> 01:40:55,287
it all began with your father's
investigation

788
01:40:57,324 --> 01:40:59,758
His partner followed up on it.

789
01:41:00,827 --> 01:41:02,886
And I executed it

790
01:41:05,465 --> 01:41:12,667
Someone high up the police ladder
had my car explode 6 years ago

791
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:16,134
Same with yours, too.

792
01:41:18,912 --> 01:41:23,440
Police were killing citizens they're
supposed to protect.

793
01:41:23,617 --> 01:41:26,313
And failing to expose corruption.

794
01:41:27,821 --> 01:41:33,282
What you did was no different
than terrorism.

795
01:41:36,630 --> 01:41:41,465
I had to break some rules
to get the rule-breakers.

796
01:41:42,869 --> 01:41:48,000
I tried doing it strictly by the book.

797
01:41:49,442 --> 01:41:53,936
I filed reports and petitions,
haggled with superiors.

798
01:41:55,115 --> 01:42:00,314
I repeatedly conducted in-house
probes on the sly.

799
01:42:02,255 --> 01:42:04,621
And yet nothing ever changed.

800
01:42:07,093 --> 01:42:09,084
You wanted 8 billion yen?

801
01:42:10,263 --> 01:42:14,962
I wanted the secret files
you were looking for.

802
01:42:16,937 --> 01:42:19,303
To go public with?

803
01:42:20,774 --> 01:42:28,112
To cut a deal with government officials
and those incriminated by it.

804
01:42:29,749 --> 01:42:32,445
What kind of deal?

805
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:36,918
Individually, people have limited power.

806
01:42:38,325 --> 01:42:41,954
Destroying them in public would
accomplish little.

807
01:42:43,797 --> 01:42:46,129
Goto's methods were naive.

808
01:42:48,702 --> 01:42:54,197
Rolling a few titular heads won't
cure the rot inside.

809
01:42:55,542 --> 01:43:00,707
Organized crime requires an
organized response.

810
01:43:03,083 --> 01:43:04,880
Otherwise...

811
01:43:07,854 --> 01:43:10,345
you can't even protect
the ones you love

812
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:14,750
I disagree.

813
01:43:16,396 --> 01:43:18,364
So would your fianc?

814
01:43:20,333 --> 01:43:23,166
She would've wanted you
to stay the course

815
01:43:23,503 --> 01:43:25,562
To remain on the side of justice.

816
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:29,965
To hell with matching strengths

817
01:43:30,877 --> 01:43:33,607
She would rather have seen
you fight your way.

818
01:43:39,052 --> 01:43:43,250
With you gone, the plan ends
nearly perfectly.

819
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:45,885
You'd better shoot.

820
01:43:50,330 --> 01:43:51,922
Because I will.

821
01:44:02,042 --> 01:44:04,135
Your way...

822
01:44:06,413 --> 01:44:08,973
only breeds more vengeance.

823
01:45:07,107 --> 01:45:07,971
Saiki...
