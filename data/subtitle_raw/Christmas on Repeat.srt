1
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,735
Andrea, are you okay?

2
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,779
Yeah, I just lost a contact.

3
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,030
That must have been tough to do,

4
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,741
'cause you don't wear contacts.

5
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,702
Okay, I fell off
the couch again.

6
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,620
You really should stop
sleeping at the office.

7
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,247
Well, that would mean
I would have to stop

8
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:22,832
living at the office.

9
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,917
Hey, it's five minutes
until Christmas break.

10
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,461
You'll get to spend a whole week
at home with your family.

11
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,672
- Did you get...
- Gifts for your hubby and kids?

12
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,299
Wrapped and waiting in your car.

13
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,967
What about...

14
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,135
Bonuses for the mailing room
and cleaning crews?

15
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,178
All taken care of.

16
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,306
I just realized
I didn't get you anything.

17
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,474
Yes, you did,

18
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,518
and you were generous.

19
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,020
How generous?

20
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,689
Very generous.

21
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,066
Merry Christmas, Jess.

22
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,360
Merry Christmas.

23
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,532
Huh.

24
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,160
Andrea, just the person
I was looking for.

25
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,161
Hi, Nick.

26
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,537
Got a minute?

27
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,040
- Not really.
- Great, come on in.

28
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:08,085
Nick, I booked this time
off in August.

29
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,378
My family's waiting for me.

30
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,048
I'll be quick.
Take a seat.

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,345
First, I wanna congratulate you
on the Hedgewear campaign.

32
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,430
The client is ecstatic,

33
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,975
and the sales on the dishes
are just off the charts.

34
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,770
They have charts for dishes.

35
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,606
Everybody's got charts.

36
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,693
So I spoke with Donna Lennon
this afternoon.

37
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,737
She's the, uh, chairman

38
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,156
for the Green, Clean
and Pristine Cleaning Supplies.

39
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,658
That's Will's campaign.

40
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,327
Very good observation,
very astute.

41
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:45,373
But see, he's spending
Christmas in The Bahamas.

42
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,791
And?

43
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,167
And Layla Brown,
their spokesperson,

44
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,669
is here in Boston.

45
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,878
She was supposed
to shoot a commercial

46
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,213
for us this afternoon,

47
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,048
but she missed her flight
and was late.

48
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,092
And she's leaving for Italy
on the evening of the 26th.

49
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,551
So we're gonna have
to move the shoot.

50
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,303
Let me guess...

51
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,515
to tomorrow, Christmas Day.

52
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,226
It'll just be a couple hours,
first thing in the morning.

53
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,936
It's Christmas.

54
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,229
Christmas morning, yeah.

55
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,689
And it'll be super easy,
super quick.

56
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,107
Will already hired the crew,

57
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,025
we got Paul Selmon
as the director,

58
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,570
who you already know,
which is, which is great.

59
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,782
All we need from you
is just to show up on set.

60
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,784
You know, keep Layla happy
for a couple hours

61
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,244
while she says some lines,

62
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,121
then you get to go
to your family.

63
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,914
You know I wouldn't ask you
if it wasn't important, right?

64
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,166
Okay, I might. But it is.

65
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,001
And what an ideal way
to end your year.

66
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,795
You know we're
considering promotions.

67
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,588
Three hours and I'm out.

68
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,841
Three, four or five, tops.

69
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:37,884
Yes, then you're out.

70
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,346
What are you still doing here?

71
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,722
Get outta here,
enjoy your time off.

72
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,891
What time off?

73
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,117
- Hey.
- Hey.

74
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:04,702
- You headed home?
- Yes.

75
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,995
I'm just gonna stop at the store

76
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,997
and pick up some groceries.

77
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,582
I thought maybe we
could make breakfast tomorrow.

78
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,584
- Oh.
- What?

79
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,127
Uh, nothing.

80
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:16,213
Nothing, just the thought
of you making breakfast.

81
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,756
Always an adventure.

82
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,384
Hey, I've been improving.

83
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,970
Uh, I don't know if making toast

84
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,472
without setting off
the smoke alarm

85
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,474
counts as improving, but...

86
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,058
I can see your point.

87
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,227
How did the, uh,
the Hedgewear campaign go?

88
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,730
Great, I guess sales
were off the charts.

89
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,273
They have charts?

90
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,317
That's what I said.

91
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:40,237
So listen, uh, tomorrow
I might have to...

92
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,948
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
I know this one.

93
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,241
Go in to work.

94
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,618
It's just...

95
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,869
For a couple hours
in the morning.

96
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,746
- And I...
- You're sorry.

97
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,080
I know the drill, Andy.

98
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,791
John.

99
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:56,003
No, but listen, I should get
some presents wrapped

100
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,838
before the kids get home.

101
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,399
Save a couple for me,
I'll be home soon.

102
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,343
I love you.

103
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,887
I love you too.

104
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,485
Merry Christmas!

105
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,029
Merry Christmas!

106
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,782
Merry Christmas!

107
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,159
Oh.

108
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,786
Well, thank you, Andrea.

109
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,120
Wait, how do you know my name?

110
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,497
Well, I'm Santa.

111
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,582
I know everyone's name.

112
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,376
I know when they're
sleeping or awake,

113
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,336
I know if they've been bad
or good,

114
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,712
or somewhere in between.

115
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,757
Well, thank you, Thomas.

116
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,221
He knows my name,
he knows my name.

117
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,348
I told you
I was being a good boy.

118
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,392
I also know there's going
to be a shooting star

119
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,935
on Christmas night.

120
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,479
There's special magic
in a shooting star,

121
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,606
but a shooting star
on Christmas?

122
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,109
Well, the magic
is off the charts.

123
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,319
I guess everyone really
does have charts.

124
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,905
Don't be afraid to make a wish,
Andrea.

125
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:08,325
You might get
what your heart desires.

126
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,202
If only were that easy.

127
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,579
I don't really believe
in wishes.

128
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,040
Oh, but they believe in you.

129
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,752
Merry Christmas!

130
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,796
Merry Christmas, Timothy.

131
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,590
Merry Christmas!

132
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,466
Merry Christmas!

133
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,926
Hey, guys!

134
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,887
- Hey, mom.
- Hey, mom.

135
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,680
Hey, hey.

136
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,849
Ooh, look at that hat, nice.

137
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,726
- Thanks.
- I'm digging it.

138
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,895
Hey, Matt,
Ryder's mom called me,

139
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,605
she said that you weren't
gonna sleep over

140
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,981
with the usual crew?

141
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,234
Yeah, I wasn't
really feeling it.

142
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,612
Well, I guess you have
the entire Christmas break

143
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,113
to hang out with your friends.

144
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,324
Mom, I'm practicing
a new Tiptop dance,

145
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,867
you should do it with me.

146
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,577
Mother-daughter stuff
gets a ton of likes.

147
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,704
I guess I could use
a little exercise in my life.

148
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,331
Yeah, try something new.

149
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,499
Get out of those boring
work clothes.

150
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,877
Hey, your dad and I
used to dance.

151
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,378
She ain't lying.

152
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,839
Your dad had some
pretty sweet moves.

153
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,591
I used to break down like that.

154
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,009
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

155
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,218
Look at that, check the hand.

156
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,845
Dad, they've turned sour.

157
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,181
Hey, hey, don't be jealous.

158
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,682
Don't be jealous,
I can teach you.

159
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,018
As soon as I catch my breath.

160
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,729
So tomorrow, what time
are you leaving?

161
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,314
Oh, not too early.

162
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,982
Wait, you're not gonna
be here for Christmas?

163
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,567
Just a couple hours
in the morning.

164
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:27,071
Yes! I'm now 20 bucks richer.
Pay up, Matt.

165
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,115
Wait, did you have a bet whether
I had to work on Christmas?

166
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,867
- Of course not.
- We had to bet

167
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,495
whether you'd work in
the morning or the afternoon.

168
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,954
The money's in my room.

169
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,435
Then what are we doing
in the kitchen?

170
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,504
Come on.

171
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,216
Well, Lexi is quite
the loan shark.

172
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,592
She gets that from you.

173
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,052
Hey, hey, hey,
I love her to death,

174
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,220
but I just adopted her.

175
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,098
She's got your genes.

176
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,893
So tomorrow.

177
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,728
Look, Nick gave me no choice.

178
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,648
Apparently the talent
got stuck in Boston.

179
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,942
It's not even my account,
but I have to be a...

180
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,069
Be a team player, I know.

181
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,073
Just remember we could use
you here on the home team too.

182
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,744
- Sorry.
- No cookies before dinner.

183
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,163
They look good.

184
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,229
What the heck is that?

185
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,993
Merry Christmas.

186
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,872
Merry Christmas!

187
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,332
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

188
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,334
Hey, don't get too excited,
all right?

189
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,336
You know, you kids used
to wake us up

190
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,089
at 4:30 to open presents.

191
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,966
Yeah, sorry about that.

192
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,011
Uh, speaking of rude awakenings,

193
00:09:56,012 --> 00:10:00,307
who are those boys out there
with Ryder using our hoop?

194
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,268
That's Carter and Gavin,
you remember them.

195
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,395
We were on the town league
when we were in middle school.

196
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,814
Right.

197
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,982
Why aren't you out there
playing with them?

198
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,277
It's too early,
and it's too cold,

199
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,614
and basketball really
isn't my thing anymore.

200
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,741
Huh.

201
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,455
Well, are Christmas pancakes
still your thing?

202
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,041
Because I still have some time
before I go to work.

203
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,376
No.

204
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,170
Hello? The great pancake
debacle of 2019.

205
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,338
The fire department showed up.

206
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,965
It wasn't that bad.

207
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:38,303
No, it most definitely
was that bad.

208
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,888
It's a nice thought mom,

209
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,308
but I still have
nightmares about that.

210
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,228
It took me six days to get
the smell of burnt rubber

211
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,355
out of my hair.

212
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,109
Trust me.

213
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,913
Maybe we just have some cereal.

214
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,512
Merry Christmas, boys.

215
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,015
Good morning, Mrs. B.

216
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,809
Hey, Larry, Merry Christmas!

217
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,103
That's one opinion.

218
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,772
- Look out!
- Oh!

219
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:31,857
Sorry.

220
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,234
Don't worry about it.

221
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,122
Being an influencer
can be a messy job.

222
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,291
There's only one product
that I rely on

223
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,044
to keep my whites,
their brightest;

224
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,463
Glean, Cream and Stream.

225
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,798
Cut!

226
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,302
Really great work, Layla.

227
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,179
Absolutely fantastic.

228
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,764
Just one little note;

229
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:08,477
The product is Green,
Clean and Pristine.

230
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,604
Green, Clean and Pristine.

231
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,105
What did I say?

232
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,484
Glean, cream and stream.

233
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,860
Again.

234
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,278
Okay, well you know what?

235
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,947
That's actually
really hard to say.

236
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,241
Maybe they should change
the name.

237
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,076
Love that idea,

238
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,911
but this product has been
on the market for five years.

239
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,497
So I think it's maybe
a little bit late for that.

240
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,499
Let's try one more.

241
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:35,964
Remember, Green, Clean
and Pristine.

242
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,721
How's it going?

243
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,140
Absolutely fantastic.

244
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,642
If we were shooting a commercial

245
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,478
for a product called
glean, cream and stream,

246
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,064
or clean, serene and steam,

247
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,858
or clean, green and, uh...

248
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,861
What's this called?

249
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,447
Are we set?

250
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,620
And action!

251
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,622
Hi, I'm Layla Brown

252
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,376
and I wanna tell you all about
one of my favorite products;

253
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,004
Mean, Clean...

254
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,798
That's not right, is it?

255
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,718
Cut!

256
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,432
Hey, Nick.

257
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,516
How's it going?

258
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,976
Good, good.

259
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:34,229
Again, you've been saying mean.

260
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,314
Well, you know what?

261
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,357
Maybe you should do it then.

262
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,483
What's that?

263
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,152
Nothing, just rehearsals.

264
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:44,948
There's no mean,
it's Green, Clean and Pristine!

265
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,992
There, I did it.

266
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,494
For what, Christmas
with my in-laws?

267
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,163
You know what?

268
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,373
You're mean and green,
like the Grinch.

269
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,791
I quit.

270
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,792
So now she gets it right.

271
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,127
Andrea.

272
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,837
Setting up the next shot,
gotta go. Bye.

273
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,339
Layla, wait.

274
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,884
Who are you?

275
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,136
I'm Andrea Bowman
from the agency.

276
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,180
Oh, so you hired that guy.

277
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,057
Technically the agency did.

278
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,559
Well, technically
I'm not working with him.

279
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,227
Find someone else
to sell your soap.

280
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,855
Actually it's detergent.

281
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,107
Right, it doesn't matter.

282
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,484
Paul, wait.

283
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,235
Did you hire that girl?

284
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,653
Technically, the age...

285
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,655
She's like the nightmare
before Christmas.

286
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,365
No, it is Christmas.

287
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,659
She's like the nightmare
on Christmas.

288
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,703
Sorry, my wife is waiting
for me at home.

289
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,330
- I've gotta go.
- Well, can we just...

290
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:35,041
Sorry, I'm out of here.

291
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,450
Ma'am, this is
a residential area.

292
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,536
Do you know how fast
you were driving?

293
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,704
Apparently not fast enough.

294
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,290
License and registration.

295
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,941
What happened to you?

296
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,818
Layla Brown.

297
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:45,862
The influencer?

298
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,530
You know about her?

299
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,575
Yeah. Our daughter
has a slight obsession.

300
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:54,077
Ugh, I wish I had Lexi with me

301
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,205
to advise me
how to relate to her.

302
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,543
Anyway, this smells delicious.

303
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,964
What can I do?

304
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,134
Well, how about you cook off
some stress.

305
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,720
Take it out on some potatoes?

306
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,932
Yes, I think I can
successfully accomplish that.

307
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,936
How's work been for you?

308
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,022
- Eh.
- Eh?

309
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:25,902
Yeah, I'm a bit behind actually.

310
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,987
I'm home all week,

311
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,782
if you wanna go in and
catch up a couple of days.

312
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,285
Well, it's definitely an idea,

313
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,495
but I was kind of hoping

314
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,249
we could spend some time
together as a family.

315
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,668
I haven't seen much of you
since you took the new job.

316
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,546
I know, this year
has just flown by.

317
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:50,508
Well, it's been like
molasses to me.

318
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:54,054
Look, you know I support
your career, Andy, always have.

319
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:58,099
I just, I just didn't realize
you'd be working this much.

320
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,061
That makes two of us.

321
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:03,397
It's been... lonely.

322
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,901
For me too.

323
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,864
Sometimes when I'm in the office
late at night

324
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,993
and I know you and the kids
are already sound asleep,

325
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:21,623
I close my eyes and remember
the first day we met.

326
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,124
Why?

327
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,543
Because that day we bumped
into each other

328
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,795
at the restaurant.

329
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,256
Literally bumped
into each other.

330
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:33,426
Hey, I replaced that sadly
wasted glass of champagne.

331
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,762
You did, you did.

332
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,180
Chateau Seine.

333
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,683
Which is now one of your faves,
by the way.

334
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:43,728
Yeah, this is true.

335
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,272
What's also true

336
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:48,191
is when we met there was
just something about you

337
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,235
that felt like home for me,

338
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,406
and I knew I would never
feel alone ever again.

339
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,534
That's how you get
through those times, huh?

340
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:58,661
Yep.

341
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:05,834
John, I don't thank you enough
for changing my life

342
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:11,131
and for accepting Lexi
so openly and lovingly.

343
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:14,384
I am so grateful for all
the memories we've made.

344
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,761
I sure miss
making memories with you.

345
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,847
Me too.

346
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,850
Taking time away from you
and the kids

347
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,602
was never what I wanted.

348
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,939
We both agreed I needed
to take the job, right?

349
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,857
Right.

350
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,734
We wanted to keep this house,

351
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,861
we had to pay for the repairs
after the basement flooded,

352
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,740
and save for college, and, yeah.

353
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:37,992
What is it?

354
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,830
Oh, the rolls.

355
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,584
Oh, geez.

356
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,171
Oh, no.

357
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,097
They're just extra crispy.

358
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,141
There you go.

359
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,519
Extra crispy, extra burnt.

360
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,370
Are you ready?

361
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,455
Let's dance.

362
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,666
All right, let's do this.

363
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,417
Teach me how to Tiptop.

364
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,544
Tiptop's the app mom,
not the dance.

365
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,712
I knew that.

366
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,548
Just follow my lead.

367
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,968
Ready? March in place.

368
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:41,972
Shimmy clap.

369
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,894
And dribble.

370
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,397
And we're driving a car.

371
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,692
Roger rabbit.

372
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,821
Mom! Are you okay?

373
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,199
Ugh, yeah.

374
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,244
I don't really use
that ankle anyway.

375
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,645
Maybe you're past
your Tiptop prime.

376
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,249
Oh, sorry.

377
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,710
I have to take this.

378
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,383
Nick, hi.
I was just about to call you.

379
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,051
You were? Oh, that's good.

380
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,095
'Cause I'd hate to think
that you were not gonna tell me

381
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,389
that our shoot completely
fell apart today,

382
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,974
putting thousands of dollars

383
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,726
and our relationship
with our client at risk.

384
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,894
Yeah, see the thing is...

385
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,814
Actually, Andrea,
let me tell you the thing.

386
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,066
The thing is I spent
the entire day on the phone

387
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,901
with Paul, Layla and our client

388
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,903
and I've convinced them to
give us another shot tomorrow.

389
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,655
Tomorrow?

390
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,616
Nick, I wasted my entire
Christmas morning on this.

391
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,827
I need to spend time
with my family.

392
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,580
And I spent my entire
Christmas morning on this.

393
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,582
I need you to be there
first thing in the morning,

394
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,208
before anyone else.

395
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,835
I want you to babysit,
make sure everyone's happy

396
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,420
so that we get this shot.

397
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,380
Then you can spend
all the time that you want

398
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,173
with your family.

399
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,091
Is he still on the phone?

400
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,341
Nick!

401
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,343
You got it?

402
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,303
Got it.

403
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:04,680
And Merry Christmas.

404
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,642
Yeah, very, merry.

405
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,313
Grandma Millie.

406
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,440
How long have you been
standing there?

407
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,067
Since about, "Here's the thing."

408
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,444
So you heard?

409
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,905
Your boss
is frustrated with you.

410
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,865
There's a good chance
your husband may be too,

411
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,534
and if I had to guess,

412
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,870
you don't know how
you got into this pickle.

413
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,288
Right as always.

414
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,373
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

415
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,417
Me too.

416
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,296
Did my son not tell you
that I was on my way over?

417
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,882
No, he didn't.

418
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,511
Come on in, the kids
will be thrilled to see you.

419
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,179
Look who's here.

420
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,306
Well, hello.

421
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:51,976
Nana, I have to show you
this hilarious video, come on.

422
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,645
Oh, I have to tell you
this joke I heard.

423
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,939
A joke? Oh, good.
A video and a joke, I'm ready.

424
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,649
You're gonna die,
it is so funny.

425
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,734
Look, she messes up
her makeup as this cat comes in.

426
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,069
This is the girl

427
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,487
you've been telling me
all about.

428
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,198
Wait, wait, what is...

429
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,327
All right, all right.

430
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,121
A new drill!

431
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,082
How'd you know?

432
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,625
I watched you break your old one

433
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,210
the last time I visited,
remember?

434
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,755
I didn't know the basement floor
was concrete.

435
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,677
Let's open up presents from Mom.

436
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,388
- Great.
- All right.

437
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,857
You shouldn't have,
you really shouldn't have.

438
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:48,284
Uh... A sweater, yeah.

439
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,749
I don't wear perfume.

440
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:06,926
Oh, a backup mixer.

441
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,513
Huh, it's pink.

442
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:14,184
You know, this bathrobe
isn't so bad.

443
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:21,233
So, you know how the shoot
didn't go so well today?

444
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,737
You have to work again tomorrow?

445
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:26,906
How did you know?

446
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,993
I'm used to it, I guess.

447
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,498
Well, I'll do it.

448
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,958
I might reverse stress eat

449
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,628
and then hit the real food
after.

450
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,547
Okay.

451
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,509
All right,
I'll see you in a bit then.

452
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,375
I just wish I could do
this day over again.

453
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:28,676
Hmm.

454
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,317
I'm late.

455
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,201
Oh.

456
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,874
Oh, sorry I'm late.

457
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:02,835
I thought you didn't have
to be in

458
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:03,960
until later this morning.

459
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:06,004
No, it'll be the first thing.

460
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,631
Okay, well just make sure
you're home

461
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,008
on time for presents
then I guess.

462
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,217
Got it.

463
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,052
Okay, bye.

464
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,929
- Love you.
- Bye, mom.

465
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,931
Bye, mom.

466
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,815
Wait, presents?

467
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,033
Morning, boys.

468
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,576
Good morning, Mrs B.

469
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:37,952
Good morning, Larry!

470
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,039
That's one opinion.

471
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,665
- Look out!
- Ah!

472
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,958
Sorry.

473
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,543
Ryder, really?

474
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:49,130
One day is an accident,
but two days in a row,

475
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:51,050
it's beginning
to look deliberate.

476
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,094
Ah, okay.

477
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,933
Being an influencer
can be a messy job.

478
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,977
There's only one product
that I rely on

479
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,396
to keep my whites
their brightest,

480
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,690
Glean, Cream and Stream.

481
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,234
Cut!

482
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,529
I'm so sorry I'm late.

483
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,572
I overslept.

484
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:15,740
Late?

485
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,325
Yeah, right?

486
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,243
No one wants to be here
three days in a row.

487
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,330
But I'm here, I'm on it,
let's make a commercial.

488
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:23,457
Right.

489
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,459
Is something wrong?

490
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,795
I'm just saying,
sorry for being late.

491
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,588
Sorry, everybody.

492
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,714
Who are you?

493
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,966
Andrea, we met yesterday.

494
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,593
Yeah, I don't think so.

495
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,303
Really great work, Layla.

496
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,846
Just try to remember,

497
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:43,351
the product is Green,
Clean and Pristine.

498
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,436
Green, Clean and Pristine?

499
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,605
What'd I say?

500
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,735
Glean, cream and stream, again.

501
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,153
Well you know what?

502
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,571
That's actually
really hard to say.

503
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,199
Maybe they should change
the name.

504
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,035
Let's just go again.

505
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:06,541
She's like a broken record,
right?

506
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:09,335
You'd think she would've learned
her lines after yesterday.

507
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,628
Yeah, I guess.

508
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,005
Are we set?

509
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:17,093
And, action!

510
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:18,970
Hi, I'm Layla Brown

511
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,931
and I wanna tell you all about
one of my favorite products.

512
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,641
Mean, Clean...

513
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,393
Wait, that's not right.

514
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,895
Cut!

515
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,440
Hey, Nick.

516
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,192
How's it going?

517
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,987
Um, not much better
than yesterday.

518
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,197
What happened yesterday?

519
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,784
Yeah, who can remember.

520
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,911
Well, maybe
you should do it then.

521
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,414
There's no mean.

522
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,915
What's that?

523
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,835
It's Green, Clean and Pristine.
There, I did it.

524
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:53,504
Andrea, what is going on?

525
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,256
Okay? This sounds
like Christmas with my...

526
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,841
With your in-laws, I know.

527
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,218
I am sorry, I should
have gotten here earlier.

528
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,845
I'll fix this.

529
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,096
Is he still on the phone?

530
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,514
- How did you...
- Nick!

531
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,641
Coming, sweetheart.

532
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:13,524
You know what? You're mean,
and green, like the Grinch.

533
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,152
I quit.

534
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:21,657
Hey, hey, everybody.

535
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,868
Again, sorry for being late.

536
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,286
Who are you?

537
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,622
Andrea Bowman from the agency.

538
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,040
So you hired this clown.

539
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,708
Oh, come on,

540
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,336
let's not have another repeat
of yesterday now.

541
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,046
Yesterday now?

542
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,756
Is that some other
stupid product

543
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,132
you guys are working on?

544
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,051
- What? No.
- Well, whatever it is,

545
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,969
find someone else to shoot
your commercial for you.

546
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,971
And for Green, Clean
and Pristine.

547
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,599
I'm done with your little soap.

548
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,726
It's detergent.

549
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,771
So now she gets it right.

550
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:53,898
Did you hire her?

551
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,067
She's like the nightmare
before Christmas?

552
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,653
No, it is Christmas.

553
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:01,697
- She's like the nightmare...
- Nightmare on Christmas?

554
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,741
Exactly.

555
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,285
Andrea?

556
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,499
- Andrea, you okay?
- Uh...

557
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,918
What day is it?

558
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,711
It's Christmas.

559
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,630
December 25th?

560
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,841
That's usually
when Christmas happens.

561
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,180
My wife is waiting
for me at home.

562
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,432
Are you okay?

563
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,726
I've gotta go.

564
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,197
What?

565
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,119
This can't be happening.

566
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,580
People don't relive their days.

567
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,291
And really if they did,
why this day?

568
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:58,338
Why not my wedding day,
or when the kids were born.

569
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,926
Is this what a nervous breakdown
feels like?

570
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,689
Ma'am, do you know how fast
you were driving?

571
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,943
I should, but I don't know
if you told me yesterday.

572
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,196
License and registration.

573
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,335
What day is it?

574
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,837
You serious?

575
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,214
Completely.

576
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:45,259
It's Christmas.
Why, what happened?

577
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,677
Today.

578
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,388
Today is what happened to me,
again.

579
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,140
You and the kids
haven't orchestrated

580
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:53,392
some elaborate plan,

581
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:58,022
including my boss
and all my coworkers,

582
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,983
and Layla Brown, and the police,
have you?

583
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,318
Have you met us?

584
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,112
We're not that organized.

585
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,615
Andy, you don't look so good.

586
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,366
Why don't you go lay down
for a while?

587
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,786
I think...

588
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,704
I think that's a good idea.

589
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,706
Yeah.

590
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,962
Keep an eye on the dinner rolls.

591
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,131
Will do.

592
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,841
Okay.

593
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,890
Maybe it's a dream.

594
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,726
Of course it is.

595
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,728
Days don't repeat themselves.

596
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,439
It has to be a dream.

597
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,317
And if it's a dream,

598
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,944
that means...

599
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:47,447
I can fly!

600
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,160
Nope, not a dream.

601
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,040
Hey, kids.

602
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,166
Hey, did you wanna try
that Tiptop dance

603
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,584
I was telling you about?

604
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,587
Yeah, but first.

605
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,841
I have to take this.

606
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,259
Hello?

607
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,052
Andrea, were you ever
gonna tell me

608
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,971
the shoot completely
fell apart today?

609
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,556
Putting thousands of dollars

610
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,057
and the relationship
with our client at risk?

611
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,684
I kinda already knew
you'd hear about it.

612
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,310
I spent the entire day
on the phone

613
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,562
with Paul, Layla and our client.

614
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,355
And I've convinced everyone

615
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,149
to give us another shot
tomorrow before her flight.

616
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,861
That sounds good, if tomorrow
actually happens today.

617
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,445
Andrea, what,
what are you talking about?

618
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,156
Honestly, I don't know.

619
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,408
Okay, I need you on set
first thing in the morning

620
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,201
before anyone else,
can you do that?

621
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,829
I hope so, I don't really
wanna do this again.

622
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,747
Is he on the phone again?

623
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,499
Great.
Well, you know what?

624
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,209
Just call me and let me know
how everything's going.

625
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,837
Oh, and Merry Christmas.

626
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:46,965
Merrier by the day.

627
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,135
Oh, right, hi, Millie.

628
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,470
Well, nice to see you too,
Andrea.

629
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,056
Come on in, Lexi has
a video to show you

630
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,767
and Matt's been saving a joke.

631
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,605
Oh, yes, ma'am.

632
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:03,732
Immediately.

633
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:08,277
Santa's elf is here!

634
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,988
Ah, a new drill!

635
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,199
How'd you know?

636
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,451
I watched to break your old one

637
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,369
the last time I visited.

638
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,915
You didn't know
the basement floor was concrete.

639
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,416
Is she okay?

640
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,044
I think she's a little tired.

641
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,548
Let's open our presents
from mom.

642
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,176
Oh, actually I left them
at work.

643
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,178
No, you didn't.
They're right here.

644
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,097
Oh, well...

645
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,849
You shouldn't have.

646
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,977
I know, I really shouldn't have.

647
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,818
Symptoms of depression.

648
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,987
Am I depressed?

649
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,448
No, that can't be it.

650
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,410
Stroke.

651
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:00,746
No.

652
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,373
No, I'm fine.

653
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,667
I got the okay from the doctor
two weeks ago.

654
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,502
Who are you talking to?

655
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:08,587
Oh, me, myself and I.

656
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,422
Oh, really, huh?

657
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,924
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

658
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,761
It's not necessarily
a bad thing.

659
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,681
Maybe it is.

660
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:21,600
Well, I have ruled out
depression and a stroke.

661
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,019
What?

662
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:26,230
Nothing.

663
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,691
- Look, look.
- It's nothing.

664
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,567
Andy, you know I'm here

665
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,195
if you wanna talk about it,
right?

666
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,241
You wouldn't understand.

667
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:40,494
All right. You done?

668
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,079
I'll get it, again.

669
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,539
No, I got it.

670
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,416
I know, I'm,
I'm eyeing some leftovers,

671
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,875
it'll make a good dessert

672
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,129
and I'll dispose
of the evidence.

673
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,840
Okay.

674
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,176
Goodnight.

675
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,014
I'll be there in a little.

676
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:00,849
Hm-hmm.

677
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:24,164
I wish I hadn't had that day
to do over again.

678
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,935
Santa!

679
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,692
No.

680
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,236
Not again.

681
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,238
Ugh.

682
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,833
Oh!

683
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,629
Must be Christmas.

684
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,134
- Good morning.
- Sorry, no time to talk.

685
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,220
I gotta find Santa.

686
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,309
I have no idea.

687
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,945
Morning, Larry!

688
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,322
That's one opinion.

689
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,324
Look out!

690
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,577
- Sorry.
- I'll let this one slide.

691
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,706
Merry Christmas.

692
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,290
Oh, Merry Christmas.

693
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,876
Well, thank you, Timothy.

694
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,587
Merry Christmas.

695
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,339
Merry Christmas!

696
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,465
Hey, you!

697
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,592
Merry... Ooh, Merry Christmas.

698
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,928
Don't try and change
the subject.

699
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,722
What did you do to me?

700
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,306
What do you mean?

701
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:09,101
I mean, I keep living
this day over and over

702
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,936
and it's not a really good day.

703
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,272
I didn't do anything, Andrea.

704
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,774
You made your own wish
upon a star.

705
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,776
But I...

706
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,363
But I unwished it last night.

707
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,700
You can't unwish a wish.

708
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,660
There are rules to this
sort of thing, you know.

709
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,620
- Rules?
- Well, of course.

710
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,873
I mean, why would
anyone warn you

711
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:34,626
to be careful what you wish for
if there weren't any rules?

712
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,296
Why, you could just change
your wish willy nilly.

713
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:38,881
And how on earth
would that work?

714
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,257
I don't know.

715
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,842
I don't know
how any of this works.

716
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,844
You made a wish, Andrea.

717
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,679
What did you want?

718
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,140
I wished...

719
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,018
I wished I could do
the day over again.

720
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:53,061
I know what you said, Andrea.

721
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,731
But what did you want?

722
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,900
I don't know.

723
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,611
I guess everything just seemed
so messed up, I...

724
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,030
I wanted a chance
to get things right.

725
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,699
Then there's your answer.

726
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,409
Your wish comes true

727
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,371
when you finally get
what you really want.

728
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,123
How do I do that?

729
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,085
When it happens you'll know.

730
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,588
Merry Christmas.

731
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,392
- Hey.
- Andrea, where are you?

732
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,685
You're supposed to be
at the shoot.

733
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,604
Sorry, I had to talk to Santa.

734
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,106
Santa? Is that
some kind of joke?

735
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,317
I wish.

736
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,569
I didn't mean that.

737
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,071
Are you okay?

738
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:47,449
No, not until I get
what I really want.

739
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,034
Yeah, that makes two of us.

740
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,119
Is he still on the phone?

741
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,162
Nick.

742
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,039
Heading your way, pumpkin.

743
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,958
Nick, I gotta go.

744
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,002
Same time today tomorrow?

745
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,397
Do you know why
I pulled you over?

746
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,148
Hijacking.

747
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,109
No?

748
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,486
Taillight's out.

749
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,279
No.

750
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,156
Ah, I'm flummoxed.

751
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:33,161
Maybe a ticket for 150 bucks
will make you stop

752
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:36,124
the next time you feel
the need for speed.

753
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,293
Maybe.

754
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,753
Tomorrow none of this
will matter.

755
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,547
Okay to go?

756
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,967
I have to get to sleep
so I can reset this time loop.

757
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,318
Oh, you're home early.

758
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,612
Yeah, I have to get to sleep.

759
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:09,823
Sleep?
Andrea, it's 11:00 AM.

760
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,909
Good point, I should
probably take something

761
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:13,411
to help me fall asleep.

762
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:19,833
Can I ask you a question?

763
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,585
Sure.

764
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,421
You remember a couple years ago
when I made pancakes?

765
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,299
Ah, you mean when you tried
to make pancakes

766
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,051
but instead made
a small house fire?

767
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,135
Yeah, I kind of remember that.

768
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,720
Well, tell me if I'm wrong.

769
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,597
When we were outside,
barefoot in the snow,

770
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,766
watching the fire
department inside,

771
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,351
I thought I saw you smiling.

772
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,435
Yeah.

773
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,896
Yeah, yeah, I was smiling.

774
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,815
'Cause of you
trying to make something,

775
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,485
you had no idea how to make,

776
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:49,237
and no business trying
to make probably,

777
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,699
all because you knew
it was my favorite.

778
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,286
It was so perfect, so,

779
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,621
so, you.

780
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:58,957
I can work with that.

781
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,200
There it is.

782
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,535
Merry Christmas!

783
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,537
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

784
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,247
Well, don't get too excited.

785
00:41:40,248 --> 00:41:43,459
I know what will make
everyone excited.

786
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,506
Excited is not a synonym
for frightened.

787
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,800
Remember the great
pancake debacle of 2019?

788
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,301
The fire department showed up.

789
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,971
I know, but if I really
think about it,

790
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:59,391
what I really wanna do is
make pancakes for my family.

791
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:00,977
So that's what I'm gonna do.

792
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,445
It's okay.

793
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:12,989
We'll try again tomorrow.

794
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,834
- Gleam, Cream and Between.
- Cut!

795
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,628
Andrea, what is going on?

796
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,506
- Mom!
- I'm good, it's all good.

797
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,092
Again.

798
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,102
Gleam, Cream and Between.

799
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,187
Cut!

800
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:47,273
What is going on?

801
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:13,090
Green, Clean...

802
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,383
Is that a T?

803
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,013
What is going on?

804
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,349
Oh, my God, yes, mom.
Shimmy clap.

805
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,851
How do you know this?

806
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:33,735
Green, Clean...

807
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,905
This is creepy.

808
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,335
Ugh.

809
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,400
Merry Christmas.

810
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,404
So what time are you
going in today?

811
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:19,447
It doesn't matter.

812
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,658
It doesn't matter?

813
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:25,036
It's all the same,
day after day.

814
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,664
Nothing ever changes.

815
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:31,627
We get it,
school's the same way.

816
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,548
So you're not going in today?

817
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,096
When's the last time
we built a snowman?

818
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,562
- I got the carrot!
- Do it, do it, go for it.

819
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,397
Go for it. There we go.

820
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,774
Yay!

821
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,070
Hi, Larry.

822
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,450
Hi.

823
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:07,037
Hey, so, uh, so what
do we call him, Frosty?

824
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,413
Lex Luthor.

825
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:11,166
- Beyoncé.
- Beyoncé.

826
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:14,419
Um, how about Dennis?

827
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,421
Dennis? Oh, all right.

828
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,882
Well, uh,
nice to meet you, Dennis.

829
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:20,091
Don't try any funny business,
buddy.

830
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,260
We got cameras out here.

831
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,564
You wanna join them?

832
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,733
No, it's cold outside.

833
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,194
I'm going inside.

834
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,742
All righty, Dennis. Let's see.

835
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,826
Yeah, that's a good one.

836
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,703
Hey, is everything okay?

837
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,247
It's fine.

838
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:51,415
Are you sure?

839
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,876
I didn't make
the basketball team.

840
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,378
When did this happen?

841
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:58,171
A couple weeks ago.

842
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,383
Well, why didn't you tell me?

843
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,389
Grandma knew.

844
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:11,685
I wanted to tell you,
but you were at work.

845
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:13,895
Matt, I know I'm not here
all the time,

846
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,356
but no matter where I am,

847
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:20,360
whatever's going on with you
or your sister, or your dad,

848
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,696
that always comes first.

849
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:25,657
Sometimes it doesn't feel
that way.

850
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:27,742
I'm sorry.

851
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,577
I love you so much,

852
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,705
and I really do care
what's happening in your life.

853
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:36,251
And...
as far as basketball goes,

854
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:39,838
if you ever wanna practice,
I'll be there.

855
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,339
I remember
when we used to practice

856
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,760
before you got that new job,
I miss that.

857
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:51,392
How about we pick up right
where we left off now?

858
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:53,561
You're on.

859
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:58,607
Woo!

860
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,861
I gotta take this.

861
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,154
Hello?

862
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,363
How's it going?

863
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,823
Oh, great!

864
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,659
We were down by six,
then Matt scored a three.

865
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,286
He's so good,

866
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:12,121
I just think he gets
a little nervous.

867
00:47:12,122 --> 00:47:13,997
Matt? Who's Matt?

868
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,333
- My son.
- Where are you?

869
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,251
At home,
we're playing basketball.

870
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,711
You're supposed to be
at the shoot.

871
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:21,338
That is a true statement.

872
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,006
And then I thought
let's just see what happens

873
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,467
if I don't go in,
as an experiment.

874
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:28,803
Andrea, I don't think
you understand what's going on.

875
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,013
Nice!

876
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,473
Nick, I gotta go.

877
00:47:31,474 --> 00:47:33,641
I'm sure we're gonna talk
again tomorrow.

878
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,352
Just spend time
with your family,

879
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,395
they miss you that's all.

880
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:39,689
Is he still on the phone?

881
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,857
Nick!

882
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,235
Be right there, sugar plum!

883
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,238
Andrea, you need to...

884
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:50,409
Andrea?

885
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,584
The number
you've dialed is not...

886
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,930
Did you see his face
when you dunked on him?

887
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:14,307
He was like, what?

888
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,517
You set me up with the rebound.

889
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:16,769
Team effort.

890
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,397
You think if I practice enough

891
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:21,689
I can make the summer team?

892
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,067
I do.
You've always loved basketball,

893
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,527
I'd hate to see you give it up.

894
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:26,736
Yeah, me too.

895
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,738
Thanks, Mom.

896
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:32,784
It was nice
to spend time together.

897
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:34,829
Yeah, I know.

898
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:48,550
Hey, Lex, what you watching?

899
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,260
Just this influencer.

900
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,719
I'm not sure she's your thing.

901
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,972
Well, I'm up to find out
if you are.

902
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,473
Hello?

903
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,684
It's Grandma.

904
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:59,686
Grandma Millie!

905
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,229
Oh, Lexi,

906
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,065
give Grandma Millie
some breathing room.

907
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,650
It's all right.

908
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,528
I live for these moments.

909
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,738
Well, where's that
grandson of mine?

910
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,198
Oh, he's upstairs.

911
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,992
We were playing basketball
all morning.

912
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:16,035
Oh, I'm so glad
he's getting back out there

913
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,495
after he didn't make the team.

914
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,038
I just found out about that.

915
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,957
That's why he's been
extra charming lately.

916
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,751
It's all he could talk about
for a week.

917
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,628
Grandma, I have to show you

918
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,298
the video that just dropped,
come on.

919
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:29,674
It's so funny.

920
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,634
Yay!

921
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:35,221
Okay y'all, now this part
is very tricky.

922
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,849
You have to be very careful
around your lip line.

923
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:40,018
Hey, that's Layla Brown.

924
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:41,603
You know who Layla Brown is?

925
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:42,771
Actually I do.

926
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:52,780
I guess my cat, Rico, decided
to make an appearance.

927
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,824
I am so sorry, you guys.

928
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,952
Anyways, like I said,
I love this stuff

929
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,205
because it's cruelty free,
paraben free,

930
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,790
sulfate free, phthalate free,
acrylic free,

931
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:06,085
and free of any synthetic
colors and fragrances.

932
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,545
How does she do that?

933
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,506
Who, Layla?
She's a natural on camera.

934
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,007
Do you wanna do that?

935
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,759
What she does?

936
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,469
Oh, no way, I don't wanna be
in front of the camera.

937
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,887
I wouldn't mind learning more

938
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:17,639
about what goes on
behind the scenes though.

939
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,474
Mom used to take me to work
with her, remember, mom?

940
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:21,643
I had the best time
on set with you.

941
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:23,187
Of course I remember.

942
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,358
Lex, do you wanna
meet Layla Brown?

943
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:29,984
Are you serious?

944
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,028
Yeah, I was supposed
to work with her today.

945
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,821
Mom what?
Why didn't you tell me?

946
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,365
I didn't...

947
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:37,075
You didn't even go in?

948
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,702
There goes my chance.

949
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:43,540
Actually, you'd be surprised

950
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:45,376
how often these chances
come around.

951
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,921
Hello?

952
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:51,297
Andrea, finally.
Where have you been?

953
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,174
Spending time with my family.

954
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,802
Listen, I don't know if this
is some sort of power play.

955
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:56,886
No.

956
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,304
Why, would that have worked?

957
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,473
The set was a complete disaster
without you.

958
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,309
Let me guess, Layla couldn't
remember her lines,

959
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,686
had a blow up, walked off.

960
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,396
Yeah, but...

961
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,939
You convinced everyone
to come back tomorrow?

962
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,607
Well, yeah, and I...

963
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,025
And you want me there
first thing to babysit

964
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,735
and make sure
everything goes okay?

965
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,029
- Yes.
- Don't worry about it, Nick.

966
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,198
I think I know exactly
what to do.

967
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,075
And spend time with your family.

968
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,285
What?

969
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:21,786
Cue Mother-in-law.

970
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,454
Is he on the phone again?

971
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,832
Nick?

972
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,263
I had fun today.

973
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:42,015
I did too.

974
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:44,684
I haven't seen Matt that excited
about basketball in months,

975
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:47,187
and Lexi building that snowman.

976
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:51,024
They reminded me
of that first Christmas

977
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:53,610
that we spent together before
we were married, remember?

978
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:55,153
Hmm.

979
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:56,613
I had promised Lexi that
we would build a snowman.

980
00:51:56,614 --> 00:51:58,072
Hm-hmm.

981
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,741
But we didn't get
any snow all winter.

982
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:01,618
She was so disappointed.

983
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:05,496
All she wanted was to build
a snowman to welcome Santa.

984
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,998
Right.

985
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:09,292
So you found that old
snow cone machine

986
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:10,835
and you stayed up...

987
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:13,338
I remember you stayed up
all night, grinding ice.

988
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:15,173
Oh, boy.

989
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:17,414
I still don't think I have
all the feeling in my fingers.

990
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:21,512
Oh, we spent
the next morning outside

991
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,223
building the world's
saddest snowman.

992
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:27,311
Which she insisted was
the world's greatest snowman.

993
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:34,317
You know,
I think it was that day

994
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:37,320
I decided I wanted to be
a part of this family.

995
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,989
I'd never seen someone
so in love with their kid.

996
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,201
And so in love with you.

997
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:47,748
Hey, let's just get food
on the table, huh?

998
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,006
Ah, a new drill!

999
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,716
How'd you know?

1000
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,218
Well,
I saw you break the old one

1001
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:01,928
the last time I visited.

1002
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:04,305
Well, I didn't know
the basement floor was concrete.

1003
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,225
Let's open our presents
from mom.

1004
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:09,478
No, no, no, no.

1005
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,647
No, no, no.

1006
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,857
You're not gonna like it.

1007
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,109
How do you know that?

1008
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,527
It's a bathrobe.

1009
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,737
You're right,
I'm not gonna like it.

1010
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,656
If there's one thing
I've learned over and over

1011
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:24,992
from the past day, days,
doesn't matter,

1012
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:30,039
is that I am not paying
enough attention and listening.

1013
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,875
So, I'm just gonna ask you
straight up.

1014
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,460
What do you want for Christmas?

1015
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,546
Uh, Andy?

1016
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:39,674
Don't you think
it's a bit late for that?

1017
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:41,759
Well, sure, today.

1018
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,262
But there's next
Christmas tomorrow.

1019
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:47,140
Uh, so, what do you want.

1020
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:52,478
Andrea, you know
that a Christmas gift

1021
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,689
comes from the heart.

1022
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,567
It's not the gift that matters,

1023
00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:00,153
it's the sentiment
behind the gift

1024
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:06,033
that shows that you know
and love that person, right?

1025
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:10,914
And you choose the gift
based on what they like.

1026
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,417
Of course.

1027
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:18,504
Well, I'm just afraid
I'll mess things up even more.

1028
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:23,134
Hey, hey, how about
we grab some cookies

1029
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:24,260
and hot chocolates?

1030
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,012
- Yes.
- Yep.

1031
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:28,390
Yes, I'll come
help. We'll leave you some.

1032
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,819
Hey.

1033
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,865
I thought I'd check in
on you before I head home.

1034
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,410
What are you working on?

1035
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,537
Christmas gift list.

1036
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,499
Better late than never.

1037
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:59,128
Lexi, likes Tiptop
and Layla Brown.

1038
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:04,175
Well, "likes" really
isn't a strong enough word.

1039
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:07,678
Matt likes basketball,
dislikes jellyfish.

1040
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,847
Well, now we're
getting somewhere.

1041
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,557
- Grandma Millie...
- Oh, maybe I should...

1042
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,769
likes red wine,
wealthy bachelors, fast cars.

1043
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,688
True. Dislikes...

1044
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,400
Me?

1045
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,446
Oh, I don't dislike you.

1046
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,949
Well, that's a relief because...

1047
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,409
If I'm being honest...

1048
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:35,373
perhaps I dislike the way
you've been overworking yourself

1049
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:37,291
the past year.

1050
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:42,004
I took the promotion for them,
for all of us,

1051
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,883
so that we wouldn't have to
worry about money for college,

1052
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:49,137
and the house, and,
and everything else.

1053
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,057
And what good is the money,
Andrea.

1054
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:56,936
If you're not here
to take care of them with it?

1055
00:55:56,937 --> 00:56:01,858
You have a beautiful family
who love you so much.

1056
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,611
I'm doing my best.

1057
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:06,822
Are you?

1058
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,703
John.

1059
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,045
I know your intention

1060
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:26,215
is to show the people
you love the most,

1061
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:31,262
that work is not your
top priority, they are.

1062
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:34,600
So I'm not the one
you need to convince.

1063
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:44,192
Put me down for the red wine.

1064
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:50,157
And save the bachelor
for New Years.

1065
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:20,853
Andrea, what are you doing?

1066
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,521
I'm making pancakes.

1067
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,315
Pancakes?

1068
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:27,234
Uh, hello? The great pancake
debacle of 2019, remember?

1069
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,986
The fire department showed up.

1070
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:29,987
Today is different.

1071
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,530
Why is that?

1072
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,115
Because I stayed up
all night practicing

1073
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,992
to get it down perfectly.

1074
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,744
If you stayed up all night,
why are you so chipper today?

1075
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:37,953
I have no idea.

1076
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:39,373
Uh, Andrea.

1077
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:42,793
- I got this.
- Okay.

1078
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:48,381
Get the fire extinguisher ready.

1079
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:49,841
I heard that.

1080
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,804
Dig in.

1081
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:57,139
Wow, impressive!

1082
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,474
Oh, my God.

1083
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,642
Wow.

1084
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:01,686
That is amazing.

1085
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:03,771
Easy, easy son.

1086
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:04,855
Oh, my God.

1087
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:05,981
They're good.

1088
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,108
These are good, good.

1089
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:08,567
These are so good, Mom.

1090
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,444
They're awesome.
Look at this.

1091
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:14,949
John, I'm gonna need to steal
one of your gingerbread men.

1092
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,826
It's for a good cause.

1093
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:17,869
Okay.

1094
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,497
Come on, Matt, Lexi, eat up.

1095
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,290
I have big plans for us today.

1096
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,917
What kind of plans?

1097
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,045
You'll see.

1098
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:34,135
Larry, do you have
plans for Christmas dinner?

1099
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:36,095
No plans. Why?

1100
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,556
Join us, there's someone
I want you to meet.

1101
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:39,890
Me?

1102
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,267
Yes, you.

1103
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,686
See you at six?

1104
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:44,896
Yeah, six.

1105
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:47,357
Wow.

1106
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:51,068
We've lived next door
to that man for 10 years

1107
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,154
and I've never seen him
smile before.

1108
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:54,280
First time for everything.

1109
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,282
Mom, what are we doing here?

1110
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:57,491
You're here to play basketball.

1111
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,410
What?
With those guys?

1112
00:58:59,411 --> 00:59:00,911
They're not even here for me,

1113
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,788
they're just here
because they feel bad.

1114
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,291
Trust me, not only
are they your friends,

1115
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:06,667
they've been here all morning

1116
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,128
wanting to play basketball
with you.

1117
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:12,631
- Hold this.
- Okay, but why?

1118
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,675
Look out!
Sorry.

1119
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,218
Totally cool.

1120
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,762
Mrs. B, can we have
our ball back?

1121
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:19,638
I'll make you a deal Ryder.

1122
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,683
If I miss this shot, then
I'll give you your ball back.

1123
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:25,687
If I make it,
I get to play with you.

1124
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,732
All right, you're on.

1125
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,360
No way!

1126
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,780
Way!

1127
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,159
Wait, aren't you gonna play or?

1128
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,328
Oh, I have to get to work.

1129
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:43,788
Matt can play for me.

1130
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:44,789
Mattie!

1131
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,749
Mattie, finally!

1132
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,292
Where have you been?
We missed you out here.

1133
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,877
Spending Christmas time.

1134
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,128
It's cold outside, you know?

1135
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,422
- Alright, okay.
- Cool, man.

1136
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,132
Two v two?

1137
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:58,302
Being an influencer
can be a messy job.

1138
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:00,638
- There's only one product that I rely on...
- Is that who I think it is?

1139
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:05,392
To keep my whites extra bright,
Clean, Cream and Stream.

1140
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:08,188
Cut!

1141
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,607
Paul, can I talk
to you for a minute?

1142
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,026
Just a second, I have to explain
to our spokesperson

1143
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,319
what our product is called.

1144
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,906
Let's take five, it's important.

1145
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:20,908
Okay.

1146
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:23,703
Everybody, take five.

1147
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:33,295
Paul, this is my daughter, Lexi.

1148
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,964
Nice to meet you.

1149
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,967
Lexi is a huge fan
of Layla Brown's.

1150
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:39,593
Actually, she has a video

1151
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,595
that I think you're
gonna find interesting.

1152
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,097
Lexi, will you pull
up that video

1153
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:44,306
you're gonna show
Grandma Millie later?

1154
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:45,850
How did you know about that?

1155
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:47,227
I have my ways.

1156
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:55,651
Anyways, like I said,

1157
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,237
I love this stuff
because it's cruelty free,

1158
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:01,574
paraben free, sulfate free,
phthalate free, acrylic free,

1159
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:04,493
and free of any synthetic
colors and fragrances.

1160
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,537
How did she do that?

1161
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:09,832
She's been stumbling
over simple lines all morning.

1162
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:13,085
I don't know, but I think Lexi
can help us figure it out.

1163
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,045
What do you say, Lex?

1164
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,673
Mom, it's Layla Brown,

1165
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,091
I don't know what to say to her.

1166
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:21,886
Just be yourself.

1167
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:27,391
You are smart, you have
an infectious personality.

1168
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,810
So just be you.

1169
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:31,854
- Really?
- Yeah.

1170
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,773
I am so glad you're mine.

1171
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,736
Here goes.

1172
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:40,738
Wait, Andrea,
do you have any idea

1173
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,239
how much we're paying
for this shoot?

1174
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,033
I do.

1175
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:47,077
I also know we have absolutely
no idea how to fix this.

1176
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:49,748
So let's just see what happens.

1177
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:57,129
Well, what are they...

1178
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,423
Just wait.

1179
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:05,430
Well, that was unexpected.

1180
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,558
What are they doing?

1181
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,812
What did you just do?

1182
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,856
Nothing, we just talked.

1183
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,107
You made her cry.

1184
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,901
Not me, you did.

1185
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:20,402
Not on purpose, but you did.

1186
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,154
Wait, what?

1187
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,073
Layla's whole career has
just been her in her bedroom

1188
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:25,950
with her cat and her camera.

1189
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,743
This is her first big shoot.

1190
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,663
It's Christmas, she's all
alone in an unfamiliar city,

1191
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,539
she misses her cat

1192
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,833
and you've got all these
lights and cameras and people.

1193
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,211
She's overwhelmed.

1194
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:38,672
What should we do?

1195
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,550
Being an influencer
can be a messy job.

1196
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,886
There's only one product
that I rely on

1197
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:51,558
to keep my whites extra bright,
Green, Clean and Pristine.

1198
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:55,020
No mess, no stress
and no harsh chemicals.

1199
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:59,441
Try Green, Clean and Pristine,
the better detergent.

1200
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:02,112
And cut!

1201
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,490
That's a wrap!

1202
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:09,284
That was a miracle.

1203
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:11,287
No, that was my daughter.

1204
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:14,833
Lexi.

1205
01:03:18,837 --> 01:03:20,963
That was so cool.

1206
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:22,006
Can I get a picture with you?

1207
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:23,842
Yes, of course.

1208
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:26,844
Hey, Nick.

1209
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:28,595
How's it going?

1210
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:31,223
You know, for the first time
I think we got it right.

1211
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:32,891
Well, Merry Christmas.

1212
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:33,892
Merry Christmas.

1213
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:35,478
Mom.

1214
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:42,776
Well, it was so good
to meet you, Lexi.

1215
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,319
You too.

1216
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,779
I can't wait to see how
the commercial comes out.

1217
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:48,323
Uh, I'm thinking good,
thanks to you.

1218
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,908
Before she goes.

1219
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,118
Lex, why don't you show her
the Tiptop dance

1220
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:52,703
- you're working on?
- Mom?

1221
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:53,787
I'll do it with you.

1222
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:54,997
But you don't know it.

1223
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:56,040
I'll follow along.

1224
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,667
I'd love to see it.

1225
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,003
Okay.

1226
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:05,925
- You ready?
- Hm-hmm.

1227
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,680
Oh, my God, I love this one.

1228
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:14,058
How do you know this?

1229
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:15,560
I have my secrets.

1230
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:18,480
You're better than us.

1231
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:23,026
Come on, ladies.

1232
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,991
I can't believe I met
Layla Brown.

1233
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,327
But when did you learn
that dance?

1234
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:36,164
Well, technically today.

1235
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,583
Mom?

1236
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,336
No worries, I got this.

1237
01:04:43,588 --> 01:04:45,714
I'm so sorry, officer.

1238
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:48,133
I guess I wasn't
paying attention.

1239
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:51,011
See, I just brought my
daughter with me to work

1240
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:54,348
and she solved this huge
problem we were having.

1241
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:57,101
I guess I was just
so proud of her.

1242
01:04:57,102 --> 01:05:00,062
I couldn't wait to get her home
to tell her dad about it.

1243
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:01,397
I have a daughter as well.

1244
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:07,778
Her name is Cindy, she's two.

1245
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:10,489
I can see the resemblance.

1246
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:13,909
Okay, I, I guess I can let
this one slide,

1247
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,536
but just this one time.

1248
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:17,121
Thank you so much, officer.

1249
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:18,289
One sec.

1250
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:24,670
I just wanna thank you
for working so hard for us

1251
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:26,797
to keep us safe
on Christmas day.

1252
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:29,174
A little token
of our appreciation.

1253
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:30,509
Merry Christmas.

1254
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:31,677
Merry Christmas.

1255
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:33,096
Merry Christmas.

1256
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,686
Wow, that was pretty smooth.

1257
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:43,605
Well, I've had
a little practice.

1258
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,607
Dad, you're not gonna
believe what happened.

1259
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:46,734
What?

1260
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,571
Ooh.

1261
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:53,740
Layla Brown is our spokesperson
for Green, Clean and Pristine.

1262
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:56,827
I thought today was a good
bring your daughter to work day.

1263
01:05:56,828 --> 01:06:00,080
She was so cool, and she told me
I have flawless skin.

1264
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:03,250
Oh wow, the height
of human achievement. Hmm.

1265
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:06,171
I have to go call Madison,
she's gonna flip.

1266
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:09,548
Oh, I love her.

1267
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:11,550
And, wow, look at you.

1268
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:14,678
Someone's racking up
the mom points today.

1269
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,263
First Matt, and now this?

1270
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:17,931
What did Matt say?

1271
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:18,850
Well, he said you helped him
get back in the game

1272
01:06:18,851 --> 01:06:20,684
with his friends.

1273
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:23,270
I think he was embarrassed
after he didn't make the team.

1274
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:25,272
He thought they wouldn't wanna
hang out with him anymore.

1275
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:27,482
Well, they played basketball
all morning.

1276
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,443
Oh, that's wonderful.

1277
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:34,198
So, you wanna help me
get dinner ready?

1278
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,074
Actually, I have
some last second

1279
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:38,118
Christmas shopping to do.

1280
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:41,038
If I run out now then I can
be back in time to help.

1281
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,832
You haven't finished
buying Christmas gifts yet?

1282
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,501
It depends, how much
do you want a new mixer?

1283
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:47,961
Oh.

1284
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:49,379
I'll be back
in a couple of hours.

1285
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,839
Yeah, okay.

1286
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,132
And we need another
place setting for dinner,

1287
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,258
I invited Larry.

1288
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:54,676
Larry, our neighbor?

1289
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:55,928
Larry, our new friend.

1290
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:57,804
Oh, all right.

1291
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,765
Well Grandma Millie
is coming at 3:30.

1292
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:02,060
3:28, I'll see you soon.

1293
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:06,605
Man, she's good.

1294
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:09,024
Nick, I totally get it.

1295
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,776
When your in-laws
disrespect you,

1296
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:13,905
it can make the holidays
really difficult.

1297
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:15,697
Yay or nay?

1298
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,324
Um, it's not your color.

1299
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:19,159
Why don't you go
with the brown dress?

1300
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:20,869
And use the white scarf
as a belt.

1301
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,621
Um, where were we?

1302
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:25,958
Right, so you didn't just
marry your wife,

1303
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:28,752
you married her entire family.

1304
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:31,338
But you just have to set
some boundaries.

1305
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:34,007
Let them know that they
are guests in your house

1306
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:36,009
and they can't walk
all over you.

1307
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,720
You deserve respect.

1308
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,889
But at the end of the day,

1309
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:44,101
reminding them that
they're important to you

1310
01:07:44,102 --> 01:07:45,769
and that their time matters

1311
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:49,398
will give you everything
that you need in return.

1312
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:50,565
What do you think?

1313
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:51,609
It's a winner.

1314
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:56,780
Look, I know you're right,
but they scare me.

1315
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,782
I mean, what are they gonna do
when I stand up to them?

1316
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:02,661
The question is, Nick, what
are you gonna do if you don't?

1317
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:04,371
No more excuses.

1318
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:07,959
Stand up to them,
but with a big bear hug.

1319
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:13,255
Red dress with silver
or gold shoes?

1320
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:14,464
Why don't you go with both?

1321
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:15,966
I'm giving you a raise.

1322
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:17,884
Is he still on the phone?

1323
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:19,469
Nick?

1324
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:22,682
I am on the phone,
but I'll be right out.

1325
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:29,105
I'll try them on first.

1326
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:32,566
Well, thank you, Susan.

1327
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:33,817
Merry Christmas.

1328
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:36,445
Merry Christmas.

1329
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,655
Merry Christmas.

1330
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,033
Merry Christmas.

1331
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:42,326
Merry Christmas.

1332
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:43,702
It's shaping up to be.

1333
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,455
Oh, your wish
is coming true then?

1334
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:47,497
I'd say so.

1335
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:49,333
My kids think I'm a hero.

1336
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:50,834
I think I found a gift
my mother-in-law

1337
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,294
will actually like,

1338
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,463
and I'm about to win
my husband back.

1339
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:55,672
Really?

1340
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:58,175
Yes, really. Why?

1341
01:08:58,176 --> 01:08:59,343
Why do you say it like that?

1342
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:00,844
Oh, I'm just happy to hear

1343
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:03,138
that your wish is coming true,
Andrea.

1344
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,806
Is there something
you're not telling me?

1345
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,183
No.

1346
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:08,477
Oh, did I say Merry Christmas?

1347
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:09,728
Yes.

1348
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:12,190
Then no, that's everything.

1349
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:20,197
Merry Christmas.

1350
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:21,990
Merry Christmas.

1351
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:24,659
Merry Christmas.

1352
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,036
Oh!

1353
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:27,871
Oh, Millie!

1354
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:30,457
Oh, Merry Christmas.

1355
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:32,918
You look so sharp,
I love that on you.

1356
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:35,587
Thank you, the kids
will be excited to see you.

1357
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:36,671
Yes.

1358
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,591
And later on...

1359
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,053
Hi.

1360
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:45,807
Hubba, hubba.

1361
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,143
Hello.

1362
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,438
How did you know?

1363
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:54,981
Lucky guess.

1364
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,067
Thank you.

1365
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:00,029
Oh, nice, yeah.

1366
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,864
Awesome!

1367
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:03,949
Thanks, Mom.

1368
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:05,201
You're welcome.

1369
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:10,414
This is beautiful.

1370
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:12,499
But what's it for?

1371
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,876
I thought you should have a
professional looking briefcase

1372
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,879
if you're gonna keep
spending time on set.

1373
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,299
What about dad's gift?

1374
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,136
Oh.

1375
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:32,145
Chateau Seine.

1376
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:37,190
Why don't we go
into the family room

1377
01:10:37,191 --> 01:10:38,817
and leave your parents

1378
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:41,111
to have a little space together,
okay?

1379
01:10:41,112 --> 01:10:42,904
Let's go. You too, Larry.

1380
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,197
No, no, over here.

1381
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:45,449
- Oh, sorry.
- There we go.

1382
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,033
Here we go.

1383
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:48,660
Go, go, go, go.
Larry, wrong way. This way.

1384
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:49,828
- Sorry.
- Here we go.

1385
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:51,329
You'll have a key soon.

1386
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,850
That's all right,
you'll figure it out.

1387
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,674
And one more thing.

1388
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:03,843
Oh, boy.

1389
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,099
I love this.

1390
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,018
Me too.

1391
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,313
It seems like a long time ago.

1392
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:20,734
Yeah, and sometimes
it feels like just yesterday.

1393
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:23,528
I was a widow
with a young daughter,

1394
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:25,989
I didn't know if I'd
be able to find anyone

1395
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:28,658
to share the insanity with me.

1396
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:30,285
I must have been the same myself

1397
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,706
because I couldn't wait
to share it with you.

1398
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:39,920
Marrying you was the best thing
that could have happened to me.

1399
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:41,880
Look, Andrea.

1400
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:44,424
I was thinking we're in
a pretty good position

1401
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:47,552
with my Christmas
bonus financially.

1402
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,055
What do you think about us
taking a few days

1403
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:53,141
and going somewhere warm
like you've been talking about?

1404
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:56,895
Look, I didn't wanna do
this on Christmas.

1405
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:58,605
I was gonna talk to you
about it tomorrow,

1406
01:11:58,606 --> 01:12:02,485
bu I don't think it can wait.

1407
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:09,616
Things haven't been working
between us.

1408
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:11,785
I know we've hit a rough patch,
John,

1409
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:13,537
but we'll get through this.

1410
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:15,163
- We always do.
- Yeah, I know.

1411
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:17,583
We always did, Andrea, but...

1412
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:24,172
I don't know how to be married

1413
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,132
to someone who's not here.

1414
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,676
I know I haven't been here
as much.

1415
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:30,804
No, it's not just that,
Andrea, it's...

1416
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:35,141
even, even when you're here,
you're not here.

1417
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:36,644
John, I love you.

1418
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:40,689
I love you too. I just...

1419
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:44,693
I don't wanna wake up
resenting you, or resenting us.

1420
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:46,528
Don't I get a say in this?

1421
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:47,988
You had a say in this

1422
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:51,366
when you chose work
over your family.

1423
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,952
I didn't choose work
over my family,

1424
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:56,372
I chose work for my family.

1425
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:01,835
I think we need some space
and time apart.

1426
01:13:01,836 --> 01:13:03,712
It's what's best for us.

1427
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:07,008
Please, John, you're,
you're my best friend.

1428
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:09,634
I wanna fix this.

1429
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,178
We can tell 'em tomorrow.

1430
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,473
For now let's, uh...

1431
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:18,769
let's go celebrate Christmas.

1432
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:41,834
Knock, knock.

1433
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:46,546
How'd it go with Larry?

1434
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:50,967
Well, I made him promise
to call me tomorrow.

1435
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:54,429
And I thought maybe
you could use some of this.

1436
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,640
He told you.

1437
01:13:57,767 --> 01:13:58,851
He did.

1438
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:03,022
And what did you say?

1439
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:08,109
I said, it's gonna be
hard on everyone,

1440
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,487
especially the kids.

1441
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:11,697
What did he say?

1442
01:14:13,866 --> 01:14:15,785
He said it's already hard.

1443
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,373
What am I supposed to do?

1444
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,417
Promotions are in January.

1445
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:26,795
If I walk away now,

1446
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:31,257
I'll, I'll just lose everything
that I've worked for.

1447
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:34,303
What will you lose
if you don't walk away?

1448
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:40,226
I love John
with my whole heart...

1449
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,438
and I know you do too.

1450
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:49,985
It might be
time to let that be enough

1451
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:54,699
and just trust that as long
as you have him and the kids,

1452
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:58,411
that's all you need.

1453
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,873
I'm just so close.

1454
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:07,168
I, I can fix this,
I can convince John.

1455
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:10,130
I just need one more shot.

1456
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:14,843
So you think taking on
more work is the answer.

1457
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,511
I'm sorry, Millie.

1458
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:17,971
I have to get to sleep.

1459
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:19,597
I can fix this.

1460
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,726
I just need one more do over.

1461
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:30,692
One more, Andrea.

1462
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:34,613
One more do over and you'll
get everything you wished for.

1463
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:06,270
No.

1464
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:09,940
No, no, no, no, no.

1465
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:18,698
John, where are the kids?

1466
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:20,408
Matt's still in bed

1467
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,118
and Lexi went over to
Madison's this morning, why?

1468
01:16:22,119 --> 01:16:24,162
John, what day is today?

1469
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:27,791
Yesterday was Christmas,
so December 26th.

1470
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:30,543
Listen, I was thinking
we could tell the kids

1471
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:32,504
before you head back to Boston.

1472
01:16:32,505 --> 01:16:34,881
I think we owe it to them
to tell 'em together.

1473
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:37,050
This isn't what I wanted.

1474
01:16:37,051 --> 01:16:38,844
This isn't my wish.

1475
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:51,607
Santa?

1476
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:54,068
Santa?

1477
01:16:56,237 --> 01:16:57,947
I know you can hear me.

1478
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:02,118
Where are you?

1479
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:08,623
Ooh, hello, Andrea.

1480
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:09,958
What are you doing?

1481
01:17:09,959 --> 01:17:11,876
Well, I'm enjoying a day off.

1482
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,963
This is a busy time of the year,
you know.

1483
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:16,047
What gives?

1484
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:17,799
What gives what to whom?

1485
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,592
Don't get clever.

1486
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:22,428
I'm about to lose my family,
that's not what I wanted.

1487
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:24,264
Are you sure?

1488
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:25,932
Am I sure?

1489
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:30,270
Of course I'm sure,
they mean everything to me.

1490
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:33,398
You know, Andrea,
I've been around a while

1491
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:36,359
and every year kids from
all over the world come to me

1492
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,653
and tell me what they want
for Christmas.

1493
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,989
Oh, children are
marvelously straightforward.

1494
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,949
They know what they want.

1495
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:46,244
And whether that's a doll
or a new baby brother,

1496
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:50,165
or a live T-Rex,
they'll tell you.

1497
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:55,128
Grownups, well,
grownups are more complex.

1498
01:17:55,129 --> 01:17:56,838
They say they want one thing,

1499
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:59,841
but when it comes down to it,
they choose another.

1500
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:02,303
I was just trying
to take care of my family.

1501
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:06,764
This is a huge misunderstanding.

1502
01:18:06,765 --> 01:18:09,684
Please, I just need
one more day.

1503
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:13,605
Your wish is complete,
it came true.

1504
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:15,857
I'm afraid
I can't change it now.

1505
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:17,318
It's not enough.

1506
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:23,489
John, he's my everything.

1507
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:26,784
A wish isn't going
to bring him back, Andrea.

1508
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:31,707
A wish can't do what you
won't do for yourself.

1509
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:43,343
Now's not a good time.

1510
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:44,427
Oh, not a good time?

1511
01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:46,387
Andrea, now is an amazing time.

1512
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:48,306
The clients saw
the dailies from yesterday,

1513
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:49,974
they are over the moon.

1514
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:51,476
They wanna commission
a full campaign

1515
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:53,186
with influencers
from all walks of life.

1516
01:18:53,187 --> 01:18:55,480
Like gardening, dancing,
fitness,

1517
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:58,107
basically anywhere you can get
dirty, which is everywhere.

1518
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:01,110
The best part is they want you
to spearhead the campaign.

1519
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:03,029
We're talking a raise,
a promotion.

1520
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:05,573
- I mean, isn't this great?
- Yeah, great.

1521
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:06,824
We need to meet
with the clients,

1522
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:08,326
and come up with some ideas.

1523
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:10,203
So could you put some
visuals together tonight?

1524
01:19:10,204 --> 01:19:12,038
'Cause we need to meet with them
first thing in the morning.

1525
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:13,665
Oh, and I can't even wait
to tell you

1526
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:15,466
about what happened
with my in-laws yesterday.

1527
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,003
Hello?

1528
01:19:20,256 --> 01:19:22,049
Andrea, this is... Hello?

1529
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:31,058
I'll be at Jill's
if you need me.

1530
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,186
Okay.

1531
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:37,814
John, I'm sorry.

1532
01:19:37,815 --> 01:19:41,234
You don't have to
apologize anymore, just,

1533
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:42,527
I'll tell the kids tonight

1534
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:46,739
and you can call 'em after work.

1535
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:51,287
And, hey, congratulations again
on the promotion.

1536
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:03,067
So this I get to do over.

1537
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:12,784
It's starting to become
a regular thing.

1538
01:21:12,785 --> 01:21:14,244
You have no idea.

1539
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:18,456
Do you know why
I pulled you over?

1540
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:20,249
I made an illegal turn.

1541
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:23,211
But do you know why
I made an illegal turn?

1542
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:24,213
Um...

1543
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:29,342
Matt, he's a great kid.

1544
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:31,552
He has the biggest heart
of anyone I know,

1545
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:34,180
but a bigger heart
is easier to break.

1546
01:21:34,181 --> 01:21:36,933
I mean, he needs someone
there to pick him up

1547
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:39,519
and remind him
what a great kid he is.

1548
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:42,605
And Lexi, who you met yesterday.

1549
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:45,358
She is whip smart, fearless,

1550
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:47,193
or at least she likes
to pretend she is.

1551
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:49,445
She still doesn't fully
trust herself.

1552
01:21:49,446 --> 01:21:52,448
She needs somebody there
to remind her

1553
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:55,368
that she can do anything
she puts her mind to.

1554
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:59,330
And John, my better half,
my everything.

1555
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:02,375
A man I love more
than life itself,

1556
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:05,044
and I'm gonna lose all of them.

1557
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:08,423
I'm gonna lose everything
unless I get back home.

1558
01:22:08,424 --> 01:22:11,593
Wow, that was,
that was beautiful.

1559
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:16,597
Although I did let you off
with a warning yesterday,

1560
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:20,810
so I'm gonna write you a ticket.

1561
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:23,355
License and registration,
please.

1562
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:38,327
Andrea, I thought you were...

1563
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:39,620
Have you?

1564
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:40,622
No.

1565
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:43,709
Now that you're home,
though, um,

1566
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:47,171
your mom and I have
something to tell you.

1567
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:52,050
- Your mom and I, uh...
- Can I?

1568
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:54,219
Yeah.

1569
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:01,017
Kids, what your dad and I
have to tell you

1570
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:02,311
is that, uh...

1571
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:05,105
I messed up.

1572
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:10,943
I messed up over and over,

1573
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:17,283
every basketball game, or joke,
or funny video I missed.

1574
01:23:17,284 --> 01:23:20,703
Every moment I wasn't here
to cheer you on

1575
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:23,164
or cheer you up.

1576
01:23:23,165 --> 01:23:26,125
Every time I paid more attention
to things going on at work

1577
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:29,588
than to things going on
in my own home, I messed up.

1578
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:35,092
I love you more than anything,

1579
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:37,762
but I guess I got so caught up
in providing for you

1580
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:41,225
that I, I lost sight
of being there for you.

1581
01:23:43,143 --> 01:23:44,185
For all of you.

1582
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:45,937
Andrea...

1583
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:48,314
John, you have supported me
since the moment we met.

1584
01:23:48,315 --> 01:23:51,150
You have helped me
chase my dreams,

1585
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:53,778
even when I chased them too far.

1586
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:55,863
And not because you had to,

1587
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:58,617
but because it's just
who you are.

1588
01:24:00,202 --> 01:24:02,203
And I guess I just
got used to that

1589
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:05,081
and I took it for granted.

1590
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:07,291
I didn't realize
that I could lose it.

1591
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:09,502
Andrea, I really don't think...

1592
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:12,588
But this Christmas I realized

1593
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:17,385
that my dreams
are here with you.

1594
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:19,845
And without you
I don't have any dreams,

1595
01:24:19,846 --> 01:24:21,557
I don't have anything.

1596
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:26,936
Look, I don't care
if we go broke.

1597
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:29,689
I don't care if we have
to sell the house.

1598
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:32,858
I don't care if we have
to eat ramen for every meal.

1599
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:36,445
I don't care if I have
to trade in my car for a bike.

1600
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:38,323
I don't care about any of it.

1601
01:24:39,533 --> 01:24:42,326
I will let everything else go

1602
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:45,663
if there's even a chance
that I can hold onto you.

1603
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,415
Andrea.

1604
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:49,334
Don't make any decisions now,

1605
01:24:50,377 --> 01:24:53,045
but I'm not moving out.

1606
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:56,383
If I have to sleep in a tent
in the backyard, I will...

1607
01:24:59,052 --> 01:25:01,346
just as long as you're there
when I wake up.

1608
01:25:03,307 --> 01:25:05,808
Please don't make any decisions
that you can't take back,

1609
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:08,227
I've made enough of those
for the both of us.

1610
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:11,689
Andrea, I can't have
you sleeping in a tent

1611
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,025
in our backyard.

1612
01:25:14,568 --> 01:25:15,611
Because...

1613
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:21,074
as long as I wake up
with you beside me,

1614
01:25:22,326 --> 01:25:23,952
I'll be forever complete.

1615
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:26,787
Welcome home.

1616
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:29,166
Welcome home.

1617
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:36,632
Just trust me.

1618
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:41,969
Hello?

1619
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,888
Hey, where are you?
You on your way?

1620
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:45,556
I'm not coming in.

1621
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:46,766
Not coming?

1622
01:25:46,767 --> 01:25:48,726
Did I not make myself clear?

1623
01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:51,312
Nick, you've always
made yourself very clear.

1624
01:25:51,313 --> 01:25:53,648
That's one of your few
good qualities.

1625
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:56,651
But it's time for me
to make myself clear,

1626
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:58,694
I am not coming into the office.

1627
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:00,279
Okay, but the client...

1628
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,698
Specifically requested me
for this campaign, right?

1629
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:04,659
So tell them
that I am not available

1630
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:08,371
until after Christmas break,
an extended Christmas break.

1631
01:26:08,372 --> 01:26:09,830
What if they say no?

1632
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:11,624
I don't care if they say no.

1633
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:13,542
But, Andrea.

1634
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:16,128
I am not available to work
with them until next month.

1635
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:17,713
I'm taking my family

1636
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:22,551
on a well deserved vacation,
somewhere warm.

1637
01:26:22,552 --> 01:26:25,471
It's been far too long since
we acted like a family.

1638
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:27,056
Andrea, you can't do this.

1639
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:28,474
I just did.

1640
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:29,476
Andrea?

1641
01:26:33,397 --> 01:26:36,565
I am really starting
to like her.

1642
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:38,735
That's my girl!

1643
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:43,657
Bravo!

1644
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:49,245
That's what I'm talking about.

1645
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:50,371
- Did you hear that?
- Merry Christmas!

1646
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:52,206
That was great!

1647
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:54,042
So, where are we going
on vacation?
