[flying saucer whirring]

10
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,600
[Elizabeth] <i>I was seven years old,</i>

11
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,080
<i>and the sun had just set beyond,
over the Drakensberg.</i>

12
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,160
<i>And this enormous craft came across...</i>

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,920
<i>quite horizontally, across the sky.</i>

14
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,360
<i>And it was as big as a football,</i>

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,600
<i>and it was quite beautiful,
and it shone with a blue-white light.</i>

16
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,440
<i>I felt that this was something...</i>

17
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,160
the beginning of a tremendous destiny
that I was to go into,

18
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,920
and I could feel this as a child,
I sensed it.

19
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,680
<i>I had this intuition.</i>

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,760
And I felt a bond,
a communication that was so strong

21
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,480
that I simply followed this bond.

22
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,800
[little girl giggles]

23
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,760

[radio announcer] <i>We interrupt our sports
commentary. Shortly after 11 this morning,</i>

26
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,040

27
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,280
<i>with many witnesses not sure
what they were looking...</i>

28
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,480
[John] <i>GB McKenzie
is from Howick in Natal.</i>

29
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,920
<i>Son of Elizabeth Klarer's sister,
Barbara Woollatt.</i>

30
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,440
<i>A shy, sweet timber farmer
and nature lover.</i>

31
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,600
<i>Salt-of-the-earth type.</i>

32
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,520
[GB] <i>Elizabeth was before her time</i>

33
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,320
<i>because her story is something we
as South Africans can really be proud of.</i>

34
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,600
I always remember her as being so serene
and gracious and a real lady.

35
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,240
I miss Elizabeth very much.

36
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,840
[John] <i>Stella cared for Elizabeth Klarer</i>

37
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,120
<i>during her final days
at the Highway Hospice.</i>

38
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:41,040
<i>And Stella paid close attention to every
word Elizabeth said from her deathbed.</i>

39
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,720
<i>And the alien sex part made her ears
prick up every single time.</i>

40
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,360
[Stella] <i>My remembrance of Elizabeth
was her sitting up in bed.</i>

41
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,560
<i>I think she dyed her hair,
and it was swept up at the back.</i>

42
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,400
<i>She sat in her bed
with all her papers round about her.</i>

43
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,720
<i>This big blue ring and the photo
of Akon at the back of her bed.</i>

44
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,080
<i>That's why I remember her.
"Come in, dear, and I'll talk to you."</i>

45
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,560
<i>She loved talking. She loved to talk.</i>

46
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,320
She loved to talk about her journey
up into space.

47
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,320
She told me all about the interior
of the spaceship,

48
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,360
and it was red velvet
and she had sex in the spaceship.

49
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,400
And, oh, she told me the whole story.
I could never ever catch her out.

50
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,960
<i>She always stuck to what she believed in,</i>

51
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,600
<i>and never wavered off
what she thought was the truth.</i>

52
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,280
[ominous vibrations]

53
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,560
David, Elizabeth's son,
is my first cousin.

54
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,960
<i>Um, he spent most Christmas holidays
with us on the farm.</i>

55
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,760
<i>So, he's a few years younger than myself.</i>

56
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,720
<i>As far as Elizabeth's experiences go,</i>

57
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,960
<i>I myself have never seen a UFO,
unfortunately. I've never had a sighting,</i>

58
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,720
<i>but that doesn't mean to say
that I don't believe her story</i>

59
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,800
<i>because, you know, she's attended
conferences in Germany and America.</i>

60
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,920
<i>She's addressed conferences
all over the world.</i>

61
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,720
[David] <i>Yes, she was very intelligent.</i>

62
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,440
<i>I sometimes wish I had her intelligence.</i>

63
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,160
<i>But she was widely read,
she read a lot of books.</i>

64
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,640
[John] <i>Meet Elizabeth Klarer's earth son,
David Klarer.</i>

65
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,440
<i>One of two earth children with Elizabeth's
second husband, Paul Emile Klarer.</i>

66
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,960
<i>David, now retired,
was a senior risk analyst back in the day.</i>

67
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,360
<i>He was close with his mom.
Not so much with Akon.</i>

68
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,920
<i>He's never met his space brother,</i>

69
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,280
<i>and is witness to a close encounter
of a third kind himself,</i>

70
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,640
<i>which does not include Akon or his people.</i>

71
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,360
[David] <i>My mother was an amazing woman.</i>

72
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,920
<i>She was
full of love, gentleness. Peaceful.</i>

73
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,920
<i>She was very concerned
about the environment.</i>

74
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,960
<i>She was concerned about people.</i>

75
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,040
<i>She had green fingers.
Her plants always did well.</i> [chuckles]

76
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,640
[John]<i>Marina McKenzie is married to GB McKenzie.</i>

77
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,000
<i>Such a sweetheart and a retired nurse.</i>

78
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,320
[Marina] <i>It would seem that Elizabeth,
from the time she was a small girl,</i>

79
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,360
was always a little bit different
and more in touch with life out there.

80
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,880
And... naturally, he'd choose somebody
like that. He wouldn't have chosen me.

81
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,520
<i>The first time I met her
was watching GB playing hockey.</i>

82
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,800
<i>And I'd met this aunt
who, I was told, you know,</i>

83
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,080
<i>had had this episode
in her life with Akon.</i>

84
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,160
<i>And so, there was a bit of interest anyway</i>

85
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,000
<i>because it was such an unusual
and interesting story.</i>

86
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,920
<i>She was extra special and warm,
terribly warm and affectionate,</i>

87
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,320
<i>and people just warmed towards her.</i>

88
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,640
<i>She had that power, that sort of aura,
I suppose you could call it.</i>

89
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,640
And I think she attracted men
from far and wide.

90
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,960
[chuckles] Dare we say it?
Really far and wide.

91
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,360
She must've been very brave
to go off into an alien craft...

92
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,920
and face the unknown.

93
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,520
GB has a cousin, yes.
I have a cousin-in-law.

94
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,440
He tells... He very proudly tells people
that he has a cousin in space.

95
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,640
Potentially, I have a full cousin...

96
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,760
in outer space called Ayling.

97
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,280
[ominous music]

98
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,400
[John] <i>This is Sue Armstrong.</i>

99
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,480
<i>Once upon a time, a farmer next
to Elizabeth's infamous Flying Saucer Hill</i>

100
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,800
<i>in the Mooi River area.</i>

101
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,800
<i>There, she was an avid horse rider,
believer, and feisty die-hard romantic.</i>

102
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,360
<i>She has since retired and moved on,
but her eyes will always twinkle</i>

103
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,400
<i>when she thinks
of what could've been made on that hill.</i>

104
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,880
[Sue] <i>I see Flying Saucer Hill
every day of my life.</i>

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
<i>Graham and I have been married for 42
years, and we've lived here all that time.</i>

106
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,000
<i>And in fact, I married the boy next door</i>

107
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,400
<i>because my father owned the farm
next door to Danesford.</i>

108
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,760
<i>And so, from the time I was a small child,
we heard about Flying Saucer Hill</i>

109
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,880
<i>and all the stories
about Akon and Elizabeth meeting.</i>

110
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,600
I believe because of my association
with Elizabeth.

111
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,360
<i>And she did have an incredible magnetism.</i>

112
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,520
She had the most incredible eyes.
She was not totally of this earth.

113
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,880
[Elizabeth] This is a picture
I took of Flying Saucer Hill

114
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,480
with my Brownie Box camera.

115
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,280
It had a shaft of light coming right down
over the dip in the top,

116
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,120
where Akon's starship landed.

117
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,880
And I can actually see his face
in that shaft of light.

118
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,040
[John] <i>Hayley and Greg Muirhead</i>

119
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,160
<i>actually own the farm
which hosts the Flying Saucer Hill.</i>

120
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,960
<i>But as busy farmers, they tend to focus
more on their cattle and running a farm</i>

121
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,200
<i>than the alleged lights
and hill-frolicking,</i>

122
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,240
<i>as described by Elizabeth.</i>

123
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,120
<i>Even though Hayley, like Sue,
seems to be more open</i>

124
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,480
<i>to the thought of extraterrestrial
communion as such.</i>

125
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,200
[Greg] <i>A lot of that's in the eye
of the beholder.</i>

126
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,640
- <i>I think... Yes, we'll leave it there.</i>
- [Haley chuckles]

127
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,560
There are lots of holes in the story,
but just take the pearls from that

128
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,880
and see what you get.

129
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,920
And if I saw Akon today, Arkon,

130
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,000
I'd tell him, "Take me to your leader."
You know? "Take me out of here."

131
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,680
"We... Stop the world,
we want to get off!" You know?

132
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,920
- [chuckles]
- It all gets a bit much at times.

133
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:20,080
So, yes. And there's... there's magic
in a bit of the unknown, the cosmic.

134
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,520
It just brings a little bit of awe,
a little bit of interest

135
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,400
to an otherwise very...
Excel, email kind of life.

136
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,120
You know? There's nothing wrong
with that, a bit of color.

137
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,200
Good luck with this one, Akon, good luck.

138
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,680
- Only skinny women are easy to kidnap...
- [chuckles]

139
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,160
Not... not ones who enjoy food too much.

140
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,320
[Greg] <i>I mean it is, it's a lovely site.
So when you're up there,</i>

141
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,080
<i>why wouldn't you feel something, you know?</i>

142
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,120
<i>Why wouldn't you feel the beauty
and what's around you?</i>

143
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,920
But... you know, it's still...
it's still just a marvel anyway.

144
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,120
And we find the whole story
rather intriguing...

145
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,840
but to say I've seen activity,
unfortunately, that isn't the case.

146
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,080
[ominous vibrations]

147
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,080
[ominous music]

148
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,160
I went to the mountaintop.

149
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,560
And there, as I topped
the northern ridge of the dip,

150
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,040
I saw the starship landed in the dip,

151
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,160
and she was landed flat on the ground.

152
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,280
And standing beside her was a tall man.

153
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,320
I never hesitated. I ran straight to him

154
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,840
and I held out both my hands to him,
and he took them saying,

155
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,760
"You're not afraid this time."

156
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,720
I couldn't say anything,
I just shook my head.

157
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,880
I was out of breath, I was so excited.

158
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,040
And then everything happened at once.

159
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,800
He just picked me up like a feather
and stepped onto the hull of his ship...

160
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,760
and in through the open doors.

161
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,840
[Helene] <i>We went up the mountain one day,
just for another talk,</i>

162
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,680
<i>and she explained that this
was the mountain where she met Akon.</i>

163
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,080
<i>And Elizabeth started shaking,
and she was very excited.</i>

164
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,520
<i>She said,
"This is where Akon landed the spaceship."</i>

165
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:53,000
<i>And then I looked down, and it was
the eeriest experience of my life</i>

166
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,840
because in the hollow, it wasn't just
a hollow, it was shaped... like this.

167
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,720
And that area in that shape...

168
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,800
was covered with strange plants.

169
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,400
I felt totally ice cold,

170
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,600
because this, to me, was a strange
occurrence, and I'm sure that at her age,

171
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,920
she wouldn't have sat down
planting those plants.

172
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,480
<i>And she looked at that,
and she said to me,</i>

173
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,760
<i>"He promised me,
that he would leave a mark for me,</i>

174
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,720
<i>and this is the mark
he left on the mountain."</i>

175

[John] <i>Helene Rabie was a sought-after
journalist during the '70s and '80s.</i>

176
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,200

about the Klarer case.</i>

177
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,520
Akon, he had the most wonderful face.

178
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,760
He had a high forehead,

179
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,480
high cheekbones, aquiline features,

180
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,640
and these really incredible grey eyes

181
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,800
that were very compelling
and full of love.

182
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,800
And his hair... was golden,
but quite white at the temples.

183
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,440
And he must... He... he is...
In fact, I know, I knew afterwards...

184
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,160
that he was at least 6 ft 4.

185
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,240
She had a... I don't know whether it
was a degree, but she was a meteorologist

186
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,760
and she studied in Britain.

187
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,440
And I often saw communications from...

188
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,400
<i>very high officials
in the government to her.</i>

195
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,520

<i>the biggest magazine in South Africa,

197

<i>And when I read a review
about the book that had appeared,</i>

199
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,960
<i>written by Elizabeth Klarer,</i>

200
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,360
<i>I made an appointment to see her
and spent a day with her</i>

201
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,280
<i>because I thought, "This is up my street."</i>

202
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,480
<i>This kind of
anything-different-and-out-of-the-box.</i>

203
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,840
One can also wonder why would Akon choose
Elizabeth Klarer of all people on Earth.

204
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:44,120
Why would he choose her to take with him
to his planet and to give him a son?

205
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,560
One of the reasons
that she mentioned was...

206
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,800
<i>that she was a descendant
of the Venus tribe on Earth,</i>

207
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,640
<i>the original Venus people.</i>

208
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,960
<i>And he wanted to import fresh blood
into his race</i>

209
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,720
<i>for the strengthening of their bloodline.</i>

210

[Kitty] <i>It does have a very romantic
aspect to it...</i>

211
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,840
when Elizabeth told you that this man
was her soulmate.

212
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,080
<i>Akon was her soulmate,
and she had dreams of him</i>

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,200
[Elizabeth] <i>I knew his name through
telepathic communication...</i>

215
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,120

to dress her hair in such a way

233
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:48,520
that her ears were given as little

<i>The common story that is being bandied

<i>who was impregnated
by a man from the stars.</i>

244

<i>I'm sorry, that is only half the truth.</i>

<i>This woman...
was a creature from the stars.</i>

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,840
She also had proof...

249
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,040
according to her,
of her visit to this other galaxy.

250
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,440
No, it's not a different galaxy.
It's <i>our</i> galaxy, it's a different planet.

<i>which was sent to her
by the American Department of Defense,</i>

253
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,880
<i>I think it was their Airforce branch,

254
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,840
<i>Every little finest detail
of her experience.</i>

255
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,840
And it was 42 pages, A4.

256
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,200
So, it was in extreme detail,

257
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,680
<i>and I wondered
why were they so interested.</i>

258
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,440
<i>Then I knew they were doing research</i>

259
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,960
<i>and they were trying to find out
about such happenings.</i>

260
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,360
She must've had her first intimations
or contact with flying saucers

261
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,320
because she took these photographs.

262
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,400
<i>Not particularly good, but I think it
was with an ordinary camera.</i>

263

265
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,040
And I've had people say, "Well,
those look like ordinary baking pots

266
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,720

or some stupid remark.

[John] <i>Astronomers have since discovered

afterwards or something,

283
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,040
either natural or something man-made
that was happening up in the night sky.

284
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,480
We found that when we traveled
around the area where she lived,

285
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,040
<i>that the Zulu people often see
the flying saucers.</i>

286

<i>- Mm.
- And they consider them to be gods.</i>

287
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:37,360
<i>And when they see them, they fall down on
their knees and close their eyes and pray.</i>

288
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,640
<i>They don't look up again
till they're sure that they're gone.</i>

289
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,360
My sister phoned me one day and said,

"The Zulus are seeing

'The Wagon in the Sky.'"

292
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,400
And... their folklore, of course...

293
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,080
This also comes into their folklore,

294
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,440
and the correct Zulu name
for the flying saucer

295
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,280
is "The Lightning Bird".

Pure undiluted love.

and the way she transported herself.

Not at all. Not in my opinion

322
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,000
He said, "Now we're going
to the high plateau at Cathkin,"

323
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,400
because there was an air force plane,

324
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,400
one of these Harvard planes,

325
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,720
an old air force plane,
droning around the sky all the time.

326
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,120
And he said, "Let's get away from that."
And we went up.

327
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,120
And he took me up
to the high plateau at Cathkin.

328
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,480
We have guests who come here
to stay with us especially...

329
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,280
to go and visit the UFO landing site...

330
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,880
<i>where Akon or Arkon, I don't even know
how to pronounce his name,</i>

331
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,400
<i>seduced his little earthling</i>

332
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,160
<i>and swept her up into his arms
or tentacles or whatever,</i>

333
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,080
<i>and took her off to Alpha Centauri.</i>

334
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,680
<i>And they've met her,
and they believe her story.</i>

335
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,920
<i>Unfortunately, I haven't met her.</i>

336
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:56,120
<i>And being a skeptic,
being someone who doesn't easily...</i>

337
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,600
<i>believe in the irrational...</i>

338
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,240
<i>I have to...</i> [sighs]

339
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,040
<i>I have to treat her story
with... with... with some... reserve.</i>

340
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,680
[gentle music]

341
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,800
[John] <i>Paul Brogan's home
is the highest inhabited property</i>

342
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,360
<i>in the Central Drakensberg,</i>

343
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:25,320
<i>the last friendly hearth before one
ascends into the vast mountain wilderness,</i>

344
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,560
<i>and half-a-day's hike from the fastness,</i>

345
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,640
<i>the alleged spaceship landing spot
of Cathkin Peak itself.</i>

346
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,360
Behind me is Cathkin Peak.

347
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,760
It's roughly 3000m up.

348
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,120
On the top is a flat portion of land,
about the size of a soccer field...

349
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,160
and up there, allegedly...

350
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,280
a spaceman called Akon...

351
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,320
flew his "earthling" girlfriend,
Elizabeth Klarer...

352
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,480
to the top...

353
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,920
and they made mad, passionate love...

354
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,520
<i>and she conceived a child up there,
a boy, apparently.</i>

355
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,880
<i>And where the spaceship landed...</i>

356
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,200
<i>there is a bare patch of ground,
where nothing grows.</i>

357
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,840
<i>I don't know whether the spaceship caused
that, but I suspect there are perfectly...</i>

358
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,680
<i>plausible, geological reasons
for nothing growing there.</i>

359
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,840
<i>The plausible reason would be that water
has leached through this soil,</i>

360
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,120
<i>leached out all the nutrients,
so there's just sand left,</i>

361
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,520
<i>and that... Then there's nothing left
to nourish grass and trees, and so on.</i>

362
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,200
[ominous music]

363
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,960
[John] <i>And yet, here we find ourselves
with a photo</i>

364
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,120
<i>taken long before spaceships allegedly
landed on Cathkin Peak plateau,</i>

365
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:13,680
<i>where one can clearly see lush vegetation
and plant life covering the area</i>

366
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,320
<i>before a UFO crossed their plant paths.</i>

367
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,720
<i>This is Akon... who was my mother's love.</i>

368
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,720
<i>Also ostensibly the father of Ayling,</i>

369
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,600
<i>my mother's other son, who I've never met.</i>

370
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,080
It seems I have a half-brother
out there in space.

371
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:43,160
And... But I do have doubts
about this story.

372
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,960
<i>I have my doubts
that my mother's story is true,</i>

373
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,760
<i>in terms of her meeting with Akon
and going up into space</i>

374
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,600
<i>and having a child, all that. Um...</i>

375
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,480
I find it very frustrating
that there's no out-and-out proof for me.

376
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,280
I would've really liked to have known
which way this whole story goes.

377
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,680
Was it true? Was it not true? [chuckles]

378
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
But certain things have occurred, um...

379
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,520
certain writings in her book,
certain events.

380
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,680
And a major one for me
was one where she says that I was involved

381
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,720
up in the Drakensberg
and a craft landed in front of us.

382
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,280
We were up there on horseback
and this craft landed in front of us

383
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,880
and Akon got out. And I don't recall that.

384
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,600
[Elizabeth] <i>So I rode off, and...
With a groom and a packhorse,</i>

385
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,680
<i>and, of course, David with me as well.</i>

386
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,600
<i>And that's when I met him again.</i>

387
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,640
Now, surely, something like that at my...

388
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,480
even young age of, let's say,
eight or nine years old,

389
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,960
I'd have remembered something like that

390
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,200
because other parts of that trip
I do remember.

391
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,160
The idea of Akon having erased
the memory out of my mind in some way

392
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,640
has crossed my mind...

393
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,120
But then I ask myself, "Why would he have
done it? What was the purpose?"

394
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,080
Especially as she says in her book, she
needs to get this story out to the world.

395
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,040
Surely, I would've been a witness.
I would've supported her and...

396
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,800
backed her up
on that story totally, wholeheartedly,

397
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,360
if I'd seen that craft landing
and if I'd met Akon as well.

398
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,480
Fantastic.

399
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,000
[Elizabeth]
Now this one is of the same starship...

400
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,720
moving up into the higher atmosphere.

401
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,480
And owing to the moisture content
in the atmosphere,

402
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,520
there is cloud condensed around her again.

403
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,360
<i>This cameraman, he was so surprised.</i>

404
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,720
<i>And I explained to him
that if he'd taken it a second later,</i>

405
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,520
<i>he would've got the whole figure</i>

406
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,520
<i>of Akon standing there beside me
in a hologram.</i>

407
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,120
[John] <i>Pity there are no photos of Akon.
All we have is a painting,</i>

408
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,560
<i>where he looks very much
like a male version of Elizabeth.</i>

409
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,520
He won't be photographed.
He doesn't want to be arrested

410
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,800
and put into laboratories,
pins stuck in him, and needles,

411
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,840
to find out what makes him tick
as an alien.

412
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,440
He avoids that, of course.

413
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,680
And it also enables him to meet Elizabeth
regularly in those years.

414
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:17,920
[John] <i>And a bust of our alien in question
made by sculpture Bob Forbes.</i>

415
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,360
[Bob] I just had the feeling
that if I called on Akon himself,

416
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,520
that he might possibly be able to help me.
And that's exactly what I did.

417
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,120
I called on him, and within three hours,

418
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,320
I'd actually completed
this sculpture in clay,

419
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,080
which normally takes three weeks.

420
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,480
We called Elizabeth to have a look at it.
I didn't know whether it was him or not.

421
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,480
<i>And when she saw the sculpture,</i>

422
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,840
<i>she was obviously very, very excited.</i>

423
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,640
<i>Very, very happy. And it was quite obvious
that it was in fact him.</i>

424
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,280
Then the most amazing thing,
about a week later,

425
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:03,840
my son was sitting in the front room
of the house looking out to the horizon,

426
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,800
and he saw a whole series of lights
bobbing up and down

427
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,080
where they shouldn't have been.
And he called us all.

428
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,040
In fact, the whole family,
we all went rushing out.

429
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,080
And we saw these lights.
Thirteen of them on the horizon,

430
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,680
bobbing up and down and very, very bright.

431
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,240
And then one by one, they popped off.

432
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,480
And we phoned Elizabeth and she said,
in fact, that was Akon's squadron,

433
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,880
and that he'd come
just as a token of appreciation.

434
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,160
[Credo] <i>But wait...</i>

435
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,920
We're talking about the unusual.

436
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,640
We're talking about the strange.

437
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,760
And South Africa is full of these things.

438
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,360
I'm naturally a skeptic.

439
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,560
Um, I've never seen a UFO.

440
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,120
I know people, including my wife,

441
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,400
who believe they've seen lights flying
around here in the mountains at night.

442
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,800
Um, and it's normally at night,
and the skeptic in me says,

443
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,280
"And it's normally
after a glass of wine or two."

444
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,680
And... if the lights are red and green,

445
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,800
then those are the natural lights for...
for... man-made aircrafts.

446
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,160
But sometimes these lights
move very quickly.

447
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,640
I've seen lights
flying up my valley here at night,

448
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,480
but they were fireflies. You know?

449
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,600
But, you know, you can be easily deceived
when you see things you don't expect.

450
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,800
[John] <i>Oh, dear.
Well, you win some, you lose some.</i>

451
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:43,560
<i>With Captain Chester Chandler,
we're winning again, for the UFOs.</i>

452
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,920
<i>Chester is a retired
South African Airways captain.</i>

453
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,880
<i>He flew himself for 52 years.</i>

454
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,800
<i>He was also head-hunted
for the infamous Project Blue Book.</i>

455
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,120
<i>Of the 12618 collected UFO reports,</i>

456
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:04,560
<i>it was concluded that most were
misidentifications of natural phenomena,</i>

457
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,640
<i>or just conventional aircraft.</i>

458
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:14,000
<i>But a small percentage of the UFO reports
were classified as unexplained.</i>

459
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,560
<i>Captain Chandler's report is one of them.</i>

460
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,960
[Chester]<i>This event occurred on 1 July 1972.</i>

461
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,800
<i>At that time, I was a Boeing 727
captain with South African Airways.</i>

462
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:32,800
<i>And I was doing the last flight that
evening into Durban from Johannesburg.</i>

463
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:37,600
<i>And we were in the descent,
approaching to land at Durban.</i>

464
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,280
<i>Still about 20 minutes out,
you know, from the airfield.</i>

465
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,000
<i>I could see the lights, the clear sky,</i>

466
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,040
<i>there wasn't any... any... any cloud
around or anything.</i>

467
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,600
<i>I just saw a light. And I thought,
"Well, that's strange."</i>

468
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,960
<i>I thought, "This is no optical illusion,
Chandler. Look, there's something here."</i>

469
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,040
<i>So I said, "Graham, have a look out the
right-hand side. What do you see there?"</i>

470
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,720
<i>And he said, "Hey, there's a light
here." So, I called Durban control tower.</i>

471
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,840
<i>"Look, have you got
any other aircraft around?"</i>

472
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,400
<i>They came back and said
they've got nothing.</i>

473
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,400
<i>So we observed this light,
and 10, 20 seconds later</i>

474
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,080
<i>it just accelerated with enormous speed
and disappeared towards the southwest.</i>

475
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,200
After the sighting, Elizabeth Klarer
phoned me and discussed it with me.

476
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,640
But I've no other... I didn't have any
other correspondence with her,

477
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,880
or any other conversations with her.

478
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,120
It was just one of those things.
Most probably she heard of me

479
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,680
and then phoned me just to convey
her thoughts on the subject as well.

480
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,520
That was my only communication with her.

481
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,640
[John] <i>Captain Chester Chandler is not
the only one who can vouch for the UFOs.</i>

482
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:52,280
<i>Surprisingly, so can David.
It's just not... Akon-specific.</i>

483
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,640
I have seen UFOs.

484
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,440
<i>They were round,
so they could've been flying saucers.</i>

485
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,160
<i>But they were UFOs. I couldn't identify
them properly. It was at night.</i>

486
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,920
<i>They were about the size of the...</i>

487
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,200
<i>full moon or a little bit less.</i>

488
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,920
<i>And they'd suddenly appear in the dark sky</i>

489
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,960
<i>and then stop dead and then shoot away.</i>

490
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,720
<i>They were a luminous green.</i>

491
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,760
Maybe the UFO I saw might've been
an Earth-made one. It might've not.

492
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,800
It might've been from outer space.
Who knows?

493
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,800
To me it was a UFO.

494
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,400
[John] <i>Officer Piet Kitching became one
of the first-ever documented cops</i>

495
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:36,040
<i>to have fired shots at a UFO
on a farm in Fort Beaufort in 1972.</i>

496
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,440
<i>A man of many combat talents,</i>

497
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,480
<i>which include, but were not limited to,
military, Intelligence Agency,</i>

498
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,320
<i>and police force training.</i>

499
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,080
<i>He wasn't going to miss.
Not even if it's a UFO.</i>

500
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,080
[Piet] <i>The phone rang...</i>

501
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,200
<i>and I was there, I picked it up,
and it was Bennie Smith.</i>

502
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:02,480
<i>And Bennie Smith told me they saw
some object moving over the sheep kraals</i>

503
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,440
<i>and it was changing different
colors all the time.</i>

504
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,800
<i>We were actually a paramilitary force,
trained and everything.</i>

505
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,560
<i>And when I saw the object,
I think my training was still in me.</i>

506
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,680
<i>Therefore, I didn't hesitate
to take a shot.</i>

507
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,120
<i>Because I know I will shoot it down,
as I was quite a good shot in my day.</i>

508
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,200
He saw this object.
It was hovering just above the ground.

509
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,800
And when he got closer...

510
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,120
<i>But he said, as we were shouting,
it reacted to the voices.</i>

511
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,800
<i>And when he got close to it,
it turned up straight, like an egg.</i>

512
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,480
<i>It was gray. You know,
a submarine coming out of the water,</i>

513
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,640
<i>then you get that gray, it looks wet.</i>

514
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,640
<i>And by the second or third shot,
on its left-hand side,</i>

515
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,840
<i>there was a very bright light,
like flashes, that came out.</i>

516
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,280
<i>And it started making a whining sound
and then just disappeared.</i>

517
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:00,800
<i>He didn't see it go through the vegetation
at all, it just disappeared.</i>

518
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,560
But the reason why I shoot...

519
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,760
You know, I've been asked
that question many, many times.

520
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,880
I've been thinking of it over the days.
I can't tell you, I don't know.

521
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,640
<i>I don't know.
I only know, if I'd shot it down,</i>

522
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,960
<i>and it was something from Mars, Pluto,
or Neptune, or one of those,</i>

523
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,880
then... I would've been a hero. [chuckles]

524
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,120
[shot fires]

525
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,080
[John] <i>Breyside Farm's history dates as
far back as the Frontier War of the 1850s.</i>

526
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,120
<i>Bennie Smith, who phoned Piet,</i>

527
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,040
<i>was the first-generation Smith
to farm these lands,</i>

528
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,920
<i>with Craig to follow,
and his brother's son, Gary, after him.</i>

529
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,520
[Craig]<i>All I know is my dad phoned the police</i>

530
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,760
<i>because that's what you did in those days,</i>

531
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,440
<i>you'd phone the police.
I think even for a divorce.</i>

532
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,200
[Gary] <i>I still believe that it was built
by the... the Russians, or...</i>

533
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,680
so my grandfather suggested to me,
and I believe something along that line.

534
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,120
I don't believe that it was aliens
or anything from...

535
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,800
yes... out of this... out of this world,
or not from of this planet.

536
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,000
Just my opinion.

537
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,480
Well, I just said what I saw.

538
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:27,320
Uh, the question is that
if they were spies from Russia,

539
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,320
"What are they doing on Breyside?"

540
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,760
You don't send Sputniks and things
like that to investigate that.

541
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,280
This, for me,
was definitely something different.

542
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,520
The thing that doesn't explain
how the reservoir blew up,

543
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,800
- whether it be a week or two weeks later.
- Mm.

544
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,760
That... That doesn't explain anything to me.

545
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,120
I mean, that's the only part
that I don't really understand about...

546
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,280
how that happened.

547
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,240
[Piet] <i>If you look at the reservoir,
it's not one that just broke.</i>

548
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,680
- [ominous music]
<i>- There were still...</i>

549
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,880
<i>That stones were lying 20m,
25m away from that.</i>

550
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,960
<i>It must've been something
that exploded into it.</i>

551
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,600
<i>Otherwise, it would just be a hole
and the water would leak out.</i>

552
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,320
<i>That particular night
when this reservoir exploded,</i>

553
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,360
<i>an object flying, making a whining sound,</i>

554
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,120
<i>moved slowly in the direction
of Bennie Smith's house.</i>

555
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,160
<i>From Bennie Smith, I recall that he said
that it went over his house.</i>

556
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,760
His wife heard it, and himself,

557
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,520
and immediately thereafter,
there was an explosion.

558
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,080
And this is the result.

559
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,720
[Gary] <i>People came from all around
the world to come and try and see...</i>

560
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,120
<i>My grandfather told me that the vehicles
were lined up from the tar road,</i>

561
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,920
<i>which is about 5km from here.</i>

562
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,040
[ominous whirring]

563
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,600
[whirring ends abruptly]

564
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,440
In the trees over there.

565
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,480
[reporter] <i>There's been a UFO alert
across Southern Africa.</i>

566
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,800
[interviewer] <i>This is a continuation
of a possible UFO story.</i>

567
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,960
[reporter]<i>A large, brightly colored object</i>

568
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:32,040
<i>was seen traveling very fast above
Zimbabwe, Zambia, and South Africa.</i>

569
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,240
I thought it was an alien,
and he had big eyes.

570
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,840
[reporter] <i>Several planes saw it.
The experts are baffled.</i>

571
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,920
[Tim]<i>Ruwa. Ariel School. 19 September '94.</i>

572
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,200
<i>12:12 local time.</i>

573
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,880
[Tim]
Could you tell me what you saw on Friday?

574
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,800
Well, it looked like it was glinting
in the trees.

575
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:00,440
Like, it looked like round about like a...
like a disc. Like a round...

576
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,680
- [Tim] Sure it wasn't a Harrier Jump Jet?
- No.

577
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,480
[Tim] Or something
the Zimbabwe Airforce have?

578
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,120
It was, like, in a disc.

579
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,440
[Tim] What did you see?

580
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,040
I just... saw a glow over my chicken run.
A very orange glow.

581
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,760
- It was a helicopter or what?
- No, no, it was just a big, round ball.

582
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,440
We suddenly looked up and we saw this...
thing coming over the top of the hill.

583
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,880
As it sort of... came abreast of us,
it suddenly, uh,

584
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,400
changed from this glow to, let's say,
two big red, orange balls.

585
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,160
It's your door.

586
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,160
[Tim]
What equipment have you brought with you?

587
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,040
Well, Gunter is a highly technical chap,

588
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,640
and he's made his own Geiger counter,
his own metal detector.

589
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,000
<i>We're going to check it out and see
if there's any radioactivity there.</i>

590
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,120
[Tim] Cynthia, what are your impressions
after this morning's little expedition?

591
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,640
Well, I certainly believe the children.

592
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:03,320
<i>I've come across a similar type of thing
in Broad Haven in Wales in 1979,</i>

593
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,520
<i>and the British didn't believe it,
although I went down three times.</i>

594
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,360
<i>And it was very similar
to the whole incident here.</i>

595
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,600
[ominous vibrations]

596
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,720
[vibrations end abruptly]

597
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,480
Perhaps one should
take the story more seriously...

598
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,760
than if it had been told
by somebody less educated,

599
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,320
or... or less inclined to rational thought.

600
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,880
[John] <i>Dr. James Hurtak,</i>

601
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,880
<i>founder and president
of The Academy for Future Science.</i>

602
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,400
<i>He holds two PhDs, and is a consultant
to the Institute of New Energy.</i>

603
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,960
Credo, I'm showing you a picture...

604
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,160
of something that looks
like a Dayze Mvondina.

605
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:48,880
This being was taken out of a spacecraft
that crashed near White Sands, New Mexico.

606
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,280
I'd like your comments on the face...

607
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,080
what has characteristics
similar to those that you described.

608
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,280
With a large head, no ears...

609
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,680
eyes that wrap around
the sides of the face...

610
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,480
<i>and a mouth cavity that goes back
only a few inches.</i>

611
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:16,280
This face has been reconstructed by
investigators with the American Airforce,

612
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,840
and may well represent
one of the four bodies

613
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,760
that was removed by Airforce commandos.

614
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,880
As one of the investigators,

615
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,760
I've brought with me also another sample
from South America,

616
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,760
showing the...

617
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,640
computerized analysis that was made
by a jet propulsion lab in Los Angeles...

618
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,760
of a metallic vehicle
that landed near Lima, Peru in 1974.

619
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,200
If you look very carefully,
you can actually see the windows.

620
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,240
The vehicle was seen
to use some type of...

621
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,160
magnetic parallel phase activity
for its propulsion.

622
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,880
Again, it represents the possibility that
there are brothers and sisters in space...

623
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,840
who are slowly
bringing us into our senses,

624
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,640
<i>that we're not alone in the universe.</i>

625
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,160
<i>I'd just visited the Atucha
nuclear facilities in Argentina,</i>

626
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,200
<i>where there are massive
extraterrestrial sightings,</i>

627
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,160
<i>suggesting a warning taking place.</i>

628
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,800
<i>Many former nuclear experts admit...</i>

629
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,040
all the way back to 1952,
all the way through the '70s and '80s,

630
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,880
that nuclear installations from Maine
to Montana in the United States

631
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
were visited by extraterrestrial ships

632
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,840
that had the power to turn off
the missile launching systems.

633
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,920
To me, this is a very significant
message because it says in effect...

634
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,320
with the dropping
of the first atomic bomb,

635
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,960
we had lost scientific control
of our planetary future,

636
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,120
according to some extraterrestrials.

637
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:55,440
And that perhaps we must be aware

00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:07,040
that the Earth must change its ways and...

687
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,440
But... I think people should start
to integrate space

00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,280
in their sphere of awareness

689
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,960
because we're all surrounded by space.

690

And outer space is not that far,
it's only 100km over our heads,

691
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,640
and there's a lot going on
in space as far as, you know,

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:23,800
<i>satellites, technology and user space.

<i>it's going to be crowded with debris.</i>

695
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:38,200
<i>So we really have to start integrating
space in our environmental awareness.</i>

696

The ozone layer,

699
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,880
Well, I think, at some point,

700
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,320
we're all worried about the future,

701
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,000

702
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:06,520
we are in danger when...
We have built enough, um...

703
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:11,400
resources and weapons now
to destroy ourselves, basically. That's...

704
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:16,360
You know, there are now 9000 nuclear
weapons that are on hair-trigger alert.

705
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,760
That means they can be launched
in a matter of minutes.

What we have done in this period
that we have been on the globe

I can't believe that it's on my finger.</i>

802
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,320
[Elizabeth] Akon gave me this ring.
The crystal in it...

803
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,360
<i>helps with our communication,
even if we're light-years apart.</i>

804
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,960
<i>And the crystal is harder than a diamond.</i>

805
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,480
[John] <i>Audrey is Piroska's daughter,
who inherited the ring.</i>

806
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,600
[Audrey] <i>When my mom passed away,
I received the bust and the ring.</i>

807
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:05,240
<i>And somehow I always feel I have this
connection with my mother and Elizabeth.</i>

808
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,400
[John] <i>Word from many Elizabeth devotees</i>

809
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:12,400
<i>are that its gems and rocks were analyzed</i>

810
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:17,520
<i>and that its components were not
to be found to be from this planet.</i>

811
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,440
<i>Not even a little.</i>

812
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,960
People have asked this question, like,

813
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,560
"Please, if we could offer you money
to take the ring

814
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,360
to have it taken to a geologist
to have it analyzed.

815
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,400
Would I be open to that?"

816
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,480
<i>My answer to that question is, "No."</i>

817
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,320
<i>My mom asked me
to please keep this ring safe,</i>

818
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,440
while... if she's no longer here.
And that is what I'm doing.

819
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,040
[John] <i>David has a few more issues</i>

820
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,440
<i>around some of these matters
of a third kind, too.</i>

821
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,480
[David] <i>I've heard that some people have</i>

822
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:51,120
<i>made reference to my possibly
betraying my mother in...</i>

823
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,320
<i>talking about my doubts...</i>

824
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:58,720
<i>but for me, there's no two ways about it.
Honesty and integrity is paramount.</i>

825
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,440
<i>That's the whole reason
why I'm voicing my doubts.</i>

826
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:06,680
It's nothing to do with betrayal, as such.
It's because I have to be true to myself.

827
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:11,320
And I have to... I have to say it.
Because that's the honest thing to do,

828
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,720
<i>so that other people
can make up their own minds.</i>

829
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,560
<i>I made up</i> my <i>mind. I've got my doubts.</i>

830
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,040
Then Akon said...

831
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,320
"Now we're taking you to the mothership."

832
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:32,520
And he explained
that the mothership is an enormous...

833
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,640
craft, like a miniature planet.

834
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,480
And also...

835
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,120
- this is a vintage ship.
- [ominous vibrations]

836
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,920
<i>He said, "We don't go into the mothership,</i>

837
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:52,120
<i>we simply attach ourselves
through magnetism...</i>

838
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,120
<i>to a door into the mothership,</i>

839
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:58,840
<i>and then the door of the starship opens</i>

840
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,680
<i>and we simply walk through
into the mothership."</i>

841
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:07,920
<i>And, of course,
the mothership is very beautiful inside.</i>

842
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,200
<i>Tremendous.</i>

843
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:13,440
<i>And, the first enormous room I saw...</i>

844
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,320
<i>there were plants and flowers and trees
actually growing in there.</i>

845
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,800
<i>And instead of having carpeting
or anything like that,</i>

846
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,560
<i>there was the most beautiful...</i>

847
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:30,440
<i>blue grass covering the whole floor,
about that long...</i>

848
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:34,960
<i>and... it had the most
beautiful fragrance.</i>

849
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:40,840
<i>And... there was even a stream
and there was a waterfall.</i>

850
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,520
<i>I was 50 years old when I gave birth.
It was a natural birth.</i>

851
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,720
<i>From Earth standards,
I wasn't a young woman...</i> [chuckles]

852
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,800
<i>...but I was in my prime really.</i>

853
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,760
<i>Akon attended to the birth of his son</i>

854
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:59,720
<i>by simply using his
wonderful healing hands,</i>

855
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,640
<i>and massaging me.</i>

856
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:08,280
<i>And he put me on this beautiful divan
that was covered in rose-red silks,</i>

857
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,560
<i>and the lovely coolness
and softness of that silk.</i>

858
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,640
<i>I was quite naked, naturally.</i>

859
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:20,920
<i>Then this beautiful boy,
he was really a golden boy, was born.</i>

860
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,520
He never even cried.
He just took a deep breath... [inhales]

861
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:30,240
taking in that beautiful oxygen air
into his lungs,

862
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,520
and this was all he needed.

863
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:37,480
If she'd had a child in outer space...
how she would have felt about that.

864
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:41,240
I tend to think that that would've been
catastrophic for her, not to see him.

865
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,480
[birds chirping]

866
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,040
If she did have somebody,
a child on another planet,

867
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:49,040
and she only saw him for that short
period of time, as she said in her book.

868
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,200
She said that she had telepathic
communication with him...

869
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:57,480
um, and that would've been enough for her,
as per her book.

870
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:01,000
But I find that very difficult to believe
that. Because the way she was,

871
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:04,320
she must've struggled
with being separated from her child...

872
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,800
for months and years,
and never seeing him.

873
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,400
To me, that is a... problem.

874
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,480
I find that difficult to accept,
knowing her nature.

875
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:19,560
They're millions of years
ahead of us in all ways,

876
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:26,040
and this... Even to the fact
that they are a natural...

877
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,440
beautiful people...

878
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:34,840
who live in complete,
harmonic interaction with all nature.

879
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:41,120
So, their whole way of life,
of loving, of breeding,

880
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,200
is perfectly natural.

881
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:49,760
[John] <i>Books. Interstellar travel.
Alien babies. Allegedly alleged.</i>

882
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,720
<i>A third book that Elizabeth
never got to finish.</i>

883
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,520
<i>It dealt with the actual
technology on Meton</i>

884
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:00,840
<i>and how that could be incorporated
here on Earth.</i>

885
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:04,720
<i>We have since found
the unfinished manuscript.</i>

886
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:09,920
<i>As these things go, aptly titled,</i>
The Gravity File.

887
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,920
[Jonathan] <i>We're very privileged
to have as our guest this evening,</i>

888
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:18,360
<i>the author of the book,</i> Beyond
the Light Barrier, <i>Elizabeth Klarer.</i>

889
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,760
<i>Mrs. Klarer,
does your present visit to Natal</i>

890
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:26,480
<i>mean that you're going to travel
to the Drakensberg to meet Akon again?</i>

891
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,360
[Elizabeth] <i>Yes, definitely.</i>

892
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,600
[Jonathan] <i>Is he going to take you,
perhaps, to his home,</i>

893
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,400
<i>or will this just be a visit
in the Drakensberg?</i>

894
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:38,320
[Elizabeth] <i>Just a visit.
Because I have another book to complete.</i>

895
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:43,920
<i>I have a lot of work to do. I have to
complete the new book at his direction.</i>

896
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:47,240
[Jonathan] <i>This new book of yours,</i>
The Gravity File,

897
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,400
<i>what's that going to be about?</i>

898
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:53,640
We're talking of <i>The Gravity File</i>,
the second book of Elizabeth Klarer,

899
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:58,560
<i>where she went further,
and tried to write down what she learned</i>

900
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:02,880
<i>from life in the universe,
science underlying the universe.</i>

901
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,400
<i>But she was not the best scientist,
and scientifically trained.</i>

902
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:13,080
<i>So she tried her best with the information
she got, to write down.</i>

903
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:17,080
<i>And the information she wrote
is important for us</i>

904
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,440
<i>to read behind the lines,</i>

905
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:24,280
<i>and not to trip
over single words or terms.</i>

906
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,040
<i>There's something bigger going on.
And she gleaned it,</i>

907
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:31,760
<i>and she tried to capture it
in the second book,</i> The Gravity File.

908
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,960
There's no profound scientific discloser.

909
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:37,840
He took me out of the starship.

910
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:41,680
<i>He wore a gravity belt,
buckled it around his waist,</i>

911
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,200
<i>switched it on,</i>

912
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:48,360
<i>and, of course, it sets up
an antigravity field around him,</i>

913
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,360
<i>so that he doesn't have to tread
on the ground.</i>

914
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,760
<i>He simply carried me,
and he just sailed over the top.</i>

915
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,680
[TV interviewer]<i>One of the most interesting outcomes</i>

916
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,800
<i>with Elizabeth's contact with Akon,</i>

917
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,680
<i>has been his explanation of the light
power system used in his spaceship.</i>

918
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,800
<i>Elizabeth revealed these details in her
book,</i> Beyond the Light Barrier.

919
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:09,840
He could disappear instantly

920
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:15,760
by simply intensifying the field
differentials around his ship

921
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:21,120
because his ship is powered
by light in different frequencies.

922
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:25,200
Which are electromagnetism,
electricity, gravity.

923
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:31,560
We call it electrogravitics
propulsion or power system.

924
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:39,560
[TV interviewer] <i>And this subsequently
led to her having lengthy discussions</i>

925
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,760
<i>with the Russian, German,
and US space administrations,</i>

926
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,280
<i>who were surprised at her intimate
knowledge of the starship's power system.</i>

927
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:51,240
<i>At the International Congress
of UFOs in Wiesbaden in 1975,</i>

928
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,320
<i>her speech on the secrets of light</i>

929
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:57,000
<i>was given a standing ovation
by scientists of 22 nations.</i>

930
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,920
I'm convinced that her first book,

931
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:06,240
the visit with Akon, to Alpha Centauri...
I'm convinced that that is true.

932
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:11,760
And it changed her life forever.
And she tried to then study more,

933
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,400
tried to understand more
about what's happening in the universe.

934
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:22,240
But not being a top physicist,
she couldn't get everything right.

935
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,080
So, I won't hold it against her.

936
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:29,600
The second major doubt I have
occurred not so long ago,

937
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:34,720
probably about five or six years ago,
when I'd found her first manuscript.

938
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,440
<i>It was written, or completed, in 1958.</i>

939
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,720
<i>And it was quite a revelation for me
to see the differences</i>

940
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,240
<i>between that first manuscript
and the second one.</i>

941
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:52,040
<i>The second one being on which her current
book,</i> Beyond the Light Barrier <i>is based.</i>

942
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,320
So the first manuscript
was quite an eye-opener

943
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,720
because it differs in many areas.

944
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:00,920
There's a general theme of things
are still there, a sort of overall story,

945
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,240
<i>but... it had a different title.</i>

946
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,880
<i>It was called
the</i> Autobiography of a Venusian.

947
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,200
<i>The setting wasn't on Meton,
it was... it was on Venus.</i>

948
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,280
<i>Each chapter was prefaced
by verses from the Bible.</i>

949
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:19,720
<i>Um, the... The second manuscript,
those were all taken out.</i>

950
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:24,640
<i>Um, there was no child involved in the
first one. The second one had the child.</i>

951
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:29,520
[John] <i>Ms. Jeanie Patterson
is not only a bookworm,</i>

952
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:35,120
<i>but a sought-after researcher

953
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:39,080

01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:04,240
<i>I'm not an academic, I'm not a scientist,
but I want to know how things worked.</i>

960
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:09,520
<i>So, 50 years ago, or longer, when she
experienced this, we laughed at it.</i>

961
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,760
<i>And now I'm going, "But, hold on."</i>

962
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:16,040
<i>So, I'm reading this story and finding
more and more aspects of it that...</i>

963
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,600
<i>bypassed me all those years ago.</i>

964
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,680
This is the book that...

965
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:28,320
had a lot of underlining
and writing in... by Elizabeth.

966
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:31,480
<i>To me, it was just marking areas...</i>

967
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,560
<i>that were of interest to her for her book.</i>

968
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:40,440
<i>I couldn't find the exact words,
or strings of words,</i>

969
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,880
<i>or paragraphs in her book,</i>
Beyond the Light Barrier.

970
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:49,800
<i>It's just highlighting scientific words
that is in use everywhere.</i>

971
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,720
So, if people are going
to accuse her of plagiarism,

972
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:57,080
then they have to accuse everybody else
who's written books on this field.

[John]<i>Paul is a prolific writer and performer.</i>

977
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,560
<i>He was a member of The Space Theater,</i>

978
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:28,600
<i>a non-racial theater company,
with myself in the '70s.</i>

979
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:33,040
<i>Many decades later,
he's busy writing yet another play,</i>

980
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:40,000
<i>to do with our very own Elizabeth Klarer
called</i> Rosetta's Secret.

981
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:43,320
[Paul] <i>I started reading...</i>
Beyond the Light Barrier,

982
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,560
<i>and also reading about her.</i>

983
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:50,240
And I can't tell you the number of times I
shouted out loud in my quiet little study,

984
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,960
I went, "Wah! Wah! What?!"

985
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:58,800
<i>A pilot, a painter,
played the piano, rode horses.</i>

986
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,120
<i>"Renaissance woman"
is too small a word. I said,</i>

987
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:07,240
<i>"Do people realize what this person
was way back in the '50s and stuff?"</i>

988
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,520
It's almost beyond belief,
but she did those things.

989
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,480
I think that's what kept me going

990
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:17,240
<i>because I had what I call
my 35-year appointment with Klarer.</i>

991
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,480
<i>So, how do you get your message across?
How do you...</i>

992
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:32,000
<i>Because you know,
subtle things don't get messages across.</i>

993
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:35,840
<i>The things that get messages across
are noise and shouting.</i>

994
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,600
[shouts, rough voice] <i>Listen to my story!</i>

995
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:40,760
[normal voice] <i>It's like a rat race.
It's like, everything's like, "Whaaaa!"</i>

996
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:45,440
<i>Not the quietness.
But the quietness is a thing that works.</i>

997
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,760
If you can find a way
of living in the stillness...

998
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,720
you can find an answer to anything.

999
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,360
People say,
"Where do your stories come from?

1000
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,640
Where do your plays come from?"
They come from the stillness.

1001
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,520
Like the stillness,
it's like connecting with that.

1002
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:03,600
And Klarer connected with the stillness.

1003
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,680
And in the stillness came... came Akon.

1004
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,480
People might not believe Klarer's story,

1005
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:15,760
but, I think perhaps, what she did was,
she lied her truth.

1006
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:21,120
She... she... wanted to get her story
to many, many people,

1007
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:24,560
and the only way she could do that
was by lying...

1008
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:26,920
the truth.

01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:58,240
It <i>is</i> a Utopia, it really exists.

1012
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,840
I think we can say...

1013
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,640
that all the best storytellers are clever,

1014
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:08,160
imaginative, educated, capable people.

1015
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:14,000
Elizabeth Klarer included,
but also other charlatans.

1016
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,800
I can think of a few,
in the religious sense.

1017
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:21,040
In the cultist sense.

1018
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:26,200
To her credit, she didn't try
to start any kind of cult.

1019
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,640
She didn't try to convert people.

1020
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:33,680
She just simply tried to make
the world a better place.

1021
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:37,760
I can give her credit for that.
That's a... It's noble. Yes.

1022
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:42,080
And she did it in a time
when... when females...

1023
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:47,640
weren't quite as... as free to do
what they wanted to do, as they are today.

1024
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:53,520
So, yeah, hats off to her for that.
But she's still a storyteller.

1025
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,960
[ominous vibration]

1026
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,360

1028
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,280

Those who believe, those who disbelieve,

1030
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:15,560
Elizabeth still stands out
as a shining voice

1031
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,880
of female courage and conviction,

1032
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,360
who was able to sustain
a debate of great significance.

1033
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:28,320
I say that what I've said before,
that he is...

1034
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:33,360
a high guard of this part of...

1035
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,040
space,

1036
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:40,040
and that it is his duty
to protect all of us

1037
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:44,400
from the forces of destruction
and the forces of the negative.

1038
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:49,520
I say that Madam Klarer
should relay this message

1039
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,800
to her lover, Akon, with all haste.

1040
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:57,680
[Elizabeth] <i>The mission I have to do
is to write and to lecture,</i>

1041
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,440
<i>and to tell people about all of this.</i>

1042
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:05,400
<i>That we</i> are not <i>the only inhabited
planet in the galaxy.</i>

1043
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:10,280
<i>That there are thousands
of other planets with human life.</i>

1044
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,880
<i>We're not unique.</i>

1045
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,960
<i>This is a very wonderful truth,</i>

1046
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:21,240

the most difficult book to read.

1077

Some of the things that are just
mentioned in the book make my blood boil

1078
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:51,280
and brings back my hatred, in an intense
way, for white supremacists

1079
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:56,640
and their unbelievable hatred
for other human beings.

<i>we say things in front of our children

"There's another loony

<i>"Why would Credo Mutwa believe her?"</i>

1097

01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:45,720
The things she talked about
when she was in Meton,

1104

if we continue not understanding
climate change, global warming.

1105
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:04,040

we believe that we have ancestors.

Which is the creator

including the dust and the ants,

1109
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:13,760
and that we have the ancestors

1110
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:18,320
that mediate our lives and relationships
with our God, <i>Qamatha...</i>

1111
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,920
that brings us great blessings.

1112
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:25,920
But, I can't see them. I can't...
I've never known where they are.

1113
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:28,320
Reading this book made me think,

1114
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:31,160
"Maybe they're not far
from Meton. [chuckles]

1115
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,160
Maybe they are close there."

1116
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,520
But the thing that really sometimes
makes me feel sad,

1117
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:41,880
that I feel that what Elizabeth Klarer
represented in that paragraph...

01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:50,360
about what <i>she</i> thought
about <i>me</i> as a black person...

1120
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,640
<i>She's not alone,
and I'm afraid it still exist.</i>

1121
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:57,760
We need to find a language
that's unifying.

1122
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,000
We need to find the language
that promotes reconciliation.

1123
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:05,400
We need to find a new English
that talks about social cohesion,

1124
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,400
that talks about forgiveness.

1126
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:25,880
Am I offended by what she says?
Damn right, I am!

1127
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:30,800
Do I hate her for it?
I don't have space in my heart to hate,

1128
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:33,120
I've got so many important things to do.

inhabitants of the planet Earth</i>

1133
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,600
<i>I send greetings on behalf
of the people of our planet.</i>

1134
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,520
<i>We step out of our solar system...</i>

1135
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:07,400
<i>We know full well
that our planet and all its inhabitants</i>

1136
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:12,680
<i>are but a small part of this immense
universe that surrounds us</i>

1137
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:17,000
<i>and it is with humility and hope
that we take this step.</i>
