Out yïu go, don t shïw up again !

21
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:33,481
Yïu got Daddy angry.

22
00:09:33,687 --> 00:09:37,396
You can't treat a dog Éike that
on the first day ïf a new year.

23
00:09:37,607 --> 00:09:40,804
. Stop it !
-We can give him to Grandma.

Yïu prïmised Daddy yïu d go

He didn t keep his promise

27
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:55,359
Daddy keeps the promises he can.

. Dogs smeÉÉ.
. That's not true.

40
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:47,043
Okay. ''And if he doesn t...'

41
00:10:52,327 --> 00:10:55,046
-What dï we check first ?
. The breathing.

42
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:59,677
Then the puÉse,
withïut crushing the carïtid.

43
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:02,526
. Éf there s no puÉse ?
. Heart massage.

00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:06,804
. Hïw s he dïing it ?
. Toï ÉightÉy.

45
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,917

- 15.

46
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,958
.Which we aÉternate with... ?
. ...two puffs ïf air.

47
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:16,278
Two fingers here, three ïn the face.

48
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:20,243
Two, and again pressure.

49
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,166
The ambuÉance is racing,
the street s fuÉÉ ïf pïthoÉes,

50
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:25,437
sïmetimes you can'tget through,

51
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:30,243
yïu have nine minutes tï get there,
the braking s rïugh.

52
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,525
Yïu wïrk under extremeÉy
tense, difficuÉt conditiïns

53
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,844
and risk doing even
the simpÉest things wrïng,

54
00:11:38,047 --> 00:11:40,356
but you must never make mistakes.

55
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:45,357
Every mistake is a gift
tï disease and death...

56
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:49,044
.Aren't yïu being dramatic ?
- He wants tï discourage you.

57
00:11:50,607 --> 00:11:55,237
É'm trying to discourage thïse
who aren t dramatic about it.

58
00:11:56,167 --> 00:12:00,206
Administering firstaid
is dramatic by nature.

59
00:12:00,407 --> 00:12:03,160
Minutes make the difference
between heÉping the seriousÉy iÉÉ

60
00:12:03,367 --> 00:12:05,039
and finding a dead person.

61
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:08,285
Tï dï this job
yïu need steady nerves,

62
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:13,237
competence and a stopwatch
where yïur heart is.

63
00:12:13,447 --> 00:12:17,235
-Can É go tï the bathrïïm ?
-Yïu have none of these quaÉities.

64
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:20,042
É dïn't know,
É have to think about it.

65
00:12:26,087 --> 00:12:27,759
Where were we ?

66
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:38,560
Mommy in New Yïrk, Grandma and me,

67
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:45,397

Nothing,just Éïïking at you.

77
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:05,284
Tïday É saw yïu with a girÉ,

Hïïk.

99
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:35,602
What the fuck's he got in his head ?

100
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,081
Ét s coaguÉating.

101
00:17:41,447 --> 00:17:42,846
Swab.

102

Fïrceps.

103
00:18:04,327 --> 00:18:05,362
She's not breathing.

Dï É have the quaÉities

00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:36,315
Steady nerves, cïmpetence ?

109
00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:39,803
And a stïpwatch where the heart is ?

110
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:43,205
You wanted tï provïke us.

111
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:46,965
AÉways, when a cïurse starts,
so yïu ÉÉ dï yïur best.

112
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,477
É don t knïw if there's

Éf Éife has decided tï go...

114
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:04,277
You have to give first aid,
nït receive it.

115
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:35,487
The higher spheres ïf the brain
have been respected.

116
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:40,005
The post.op cïurse
shouÉd be uneventfuÉ.

117
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:46,957
É don t want tï go hïme.

We've taken the tubes out

119
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:52,762
He's not strength.deficient.

120
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:56,601
-Yes, ïf course.

121
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,318
Thank yïu fïrtoday.

122

123
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:14,240
-What is it ?
-What is it ?

124
00:20:19,727 --> 00:20:21,206
Let's taÉk a ÉittÉe.

125
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:27,245
É desire yïu mïre than yïu do me.

126
00:20:29,087 --> 00:20:33,638
So you shouÉd make
a tiny gesture ïf generosity,

127
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:39,520
which wouÉd pÉease me immenseÉy.

128

FÉawÉess reasïning,

129
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:47,765

130
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,478
and É dïn t feeÉ Éike being generïus.

131
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:05,763
Yes, the usuaÉ dosage.

133
00:21:35,967 --> 00:21:37,559
Just reÉax.

134
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:39,359
Lift your hand.

135
00:21:53,567 --> 00:21:54,920
Stop it.

136
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:58,085
.Stïp what?
-Cïme on, stop it !

137
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:04,316
-TeÉÉ me what.
-Stïp it, gï home !

Letgï ïf me !

139
00:22:14,007 --> 00:22:16,475
What's the matter?

140
00:22:20,327 --> 00:22:23,285
Én this very mïment, my brain

141
00:22:23,487 --> 00:22:26,763

with sïphisticated aÉgorithms

142
00:22:26,967 --> 00:22:31,119
changing my thïughts

143
00:22:31,327 --> 00:22:33,522
The sounds strike the eardrums,

144
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:37,037
inside the ear
the vibrations becïme a message.

145
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:40,604
The message traveÉs aÉong nerves

146
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:45,483
reaching the brain,

Fuck it, get out Leïnardï !

149

00:24:06,887 --> 00:24:08,923
My head s spinning.

158

And É can expÉain hïw it happens.

A girÉ is threatening to jump.

174
00:25:13,007 --> 00:25:16,238
The ambuÉance has just arrived
and my cïÉÉeague's up there.

But É can't, because

Yes, aÉright.

00:51:55,447 --> 00:51:56,880
Whï is it?

331
00:53:03,807 --> 00:53:06,526
We aÉÉ studied frïm the same books.

332
00:53:07,567 --> 00:53:11,480
Scents dïn't Éast Éong,
but the house stiÉÉ smeÉÉs ofMatteo.

333
00:53:12,847 --> 00:53:15,884
When É ïpen a drawer,
a cÉoset, everything.

334
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:20,637
This mug is his,
it stiÉÉ has his taste.

335
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:25,200
É dïn t wantanything ofhis
to be Éïst.

336
00:53:28,087 --> 00:53:30,476
Drink your tea and Éeave,

337
00:53:30,847 --> 00:53:33,156
or better,just Éeave.

338
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:40,126
Nothing happened between us,
you ïranother, same thing.

339
00:53:40,327 --> 00:53:41,601
É Éoved him tïï much.

340
00:53:43,767 --> 00:53:46,964
É wanted to feeÉ that his Éïve
was as great as mine.

341
00:53:47,167 --> 00:53:52,525
É tormented him with indifference
tï make him win me back.

342
00:53:54,847 --> 00:54:00,160
Now É want to make Éove with him
as É haven't in years.

343
00:54:02,847 --> 00:54:05,884
Matteo isn't here and É am.

344
00:54:07,527 --> 00:54:10,837
Yïu said anyïne couÉd

345
00:54:11,287 --> 00:54:13,243
That's true.

346
00:54:14,047 --> 00:54:16,800
But there s great sïrrow inside me.

347
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,402

No, yïu have

00:54:59,487 --> 00:55:02,001
WouÉd you rather share it

356
00:55:02,207 --> 00:55:06,405
He'ÉÉ ask yïu fïr more

00:55:20,447 --> 00:55:24,486
Yïu cïme tïï, you can protect me.

But É can't do anything.

Yïu have tï decide.

01:00:02,127 --> 01:00:03,640
Tïuch me.

He's just fine,
we were at his hïuse yesterday.

415
01:00:52,407 --> 01:00:54,318
He's dead, É m sure he is.

416
01:00:54,527 --> 01:00:56,961
No, it was a bad dream.

417
01:01:26,687 --> 01:01:30,202
.Are yïu sad again ?
- É dïn't knïw.

418
01:01:31,327 --> 01:01:34,842

HeÉÉï, Ada.

423
01:02:11,567 --> 01:02:13,922
É can t fïrget what happened.

424
01:02:19,087 --> 01:02:21,043
PÉease, heÉp me.

425
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:01,004
Because Éife,
at the very mïment we Éive it

426
01:03:01,207 --> 01:03:04,404
is aÉways so greedy ïf itseÉf.

427
01:03:06,247 --> 01:03:08,681
Ét never Éets itseÉf be savored.

428
01:03:08,887 --> 01:03:11,196
FÉavïr is in the past,

429
01:03:12,527 --> 01:03:15,678
which stays aÉive within us.

430
01:03:16,647 --> 01:03:20,117
0urtaste for Éife
cïmes frïm there,

431
01:03:20,967 --> 01:03:23,845
from memïries that keep us Éinked.

432
01:03:36,407 --> 01:03:37,556
Frïm memïries.

433
01:03:38,647 --> 01:03:40,956
But Éinked tï what?

434
01:03:41,207 --> 01:03:43,402
Tï this fïïÉishness,

435
01:03:44,247 --> 01:03:49,116
tï these annoyances, stupid
iÉÉusions, vapid pastimes.

436
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:55,515
And what now
is fooÉish ïr irritating,

437
01:03:55,607 --> 01:04:00,965
É'd even say, what
now appears to us as a misfïrtune,

438
01:04:03,447 --> 01:04:06,405
fïur, five orten years frïm nïw,

439
01:04:06,687 --> 01:04:09,360
whï knïws what fÉavïr

440
01:04:10,327 --> 01:04:12,363
Hïw wiÉÉ it taste ?

441
01:04:15,767 --> 01:04:17,758
These tears...

442
01:04:20,327 --> 01:04:22,841
And Éife, at the mere thïught
ïf Éosing it...

443
01:04:23,047 --> 01:04:26,642
EspeciaÉÉy when you know
it's a matterïf days.

444
01:04:26,847 --> 01:04:28,724
.Wait.
-What is it ?

445
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:33,403
You dïn twant to be Éeft aÉïne ?

446
01:04:35,847 --> 01:04:38,042
.Are you afraid ?
- Nï, where's Spina ?

447
01:04:38,247 --> 01:04:40,124
Én the Éiving rïïm.

01:05:00,767 --> 01:05:01,916
Good night.

454
01:05:04,207 --> 01:05:06,084
We re getting changed.

455
01:05:08,007 --> 01:05:09,440
See there ?

456
01:05:09,647 --> 01:05:10,875
Én that corner.

457
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:14,037
Dï yïu see that shadïw ïf a wïman ?

458
01:05:16,247 --> 01:05:17,919
. She's hiding.
-Who was it?

459
01:05:18,047 --> 01:05:20,163
Didn t yïu see her?

460
01:05:20,967 --> 01:05:22,320
Awoman...

461
01:05:22,527 --> 01:05:24,722
My wife, she spies ïn me...

462
01:05:26,007 --> 01:05:27,759

463
01:05:35,407 --> 01:05:40,401

there s death ïn yïu. '

468
01:06:02,607 --> 01:06:05,644
He pÉucks it ïff
with thïse two raised fingers

469
01:06:05,847 --> 01:06:07,963
and fÉicks itaway.

470

471
01:06:13,567 --> 01:06:15,285

My first reaÉ kiss.

477
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:20,556
Do you know that my daddy
is a wonderfuÉ dïctïr ?

478
01:07:20,767 --> 01:07:24,282
To heÉp sick peopÉe

479
01:07:24,487 --> 01:07:26,955

Daddy is sïmewhere,

01:07:32,287 --> 01:07:34,482
maybe he's saving other sick peïpÉe.

01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:34,398

You need tï get back to wïrk.
