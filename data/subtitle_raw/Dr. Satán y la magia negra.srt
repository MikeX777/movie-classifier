1
00:00:01,838 --> 00:00:08,964
I command you to appear before me.

2
00:00:10,355 --> 00:00:13,708
Plutarco Satán!

3
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:18,918
I saved you from the justice of
the world of the living...

4
00:00:20,245 --> 00:00:28,277
so that you can go on serving me.
I have an important mission for you.

5
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,424
Devil King!

6
00:00:44,425 --> 00:00:48,616
Father of Evil, King of the Dead.

7
00:00:48,617 --> 00:00:51,695
I'm tired!

8
00:00:51,696 --> 00:00:54,743
I want eternal peace.

9
00:00:54,744 --> 00:00:59,631
I shall never let you rest in peace!

10
00:01:00,773 --> 00:01:08,477
You shall return to the world,
for that is my will.

11
00:01:10,035 --> 00:01:15,148
My Lord, I've been a faithful servant.

12
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:18,852
Why should I be the one to
carry out that mission?

13
00:01:18,853 --> 00:01:21,915
You can do anything.

14
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:28,468
You think, as do all men, that
my powers are unlimited.

15
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:31,562
You are wrong!

16
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:37,756
Only man can destroy man.

17
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:44,726
Lucifer's wizard Yei Lin, will soon
find the Sorensen formula...

18
00:01:44,727 --> 00:01:47,932
and will try to challenge me.

19
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:54,388
Find the formula,
and destroy Yei Lin!

20
00:01:56,401 --> 00:02:01,730
I'll find the formula, my Lord,
and I will destroy Yei Lin.

21
00:02:04,503 --> 00:02:05,871
Beware!

22
00:02:05,872 --> 00:02:11,895
If you fail this time, you shall never
have eternal peace.

23
00:02:11,896 --> 00:02:15,920
No! I won't fail, my lord.

24
00:02:17,864 --> 00:02:23,776
Let your hand continue to guide me
towards eternal evil.

25
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:27,003
So be it!

26
00:02:43,923 --> 00:02:46,672
<i>Dr. Satán and Black Magic.</i>

27
00:02:58,028 --> 00:03:01,260
Another failure.
This formula is a fake.

28
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:05,067
- Yei Lin does not tolerate mistakes.
- It wasn't our fault.

29
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:08,532
We followed his orders to the letter.

30
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,800
- Boss! The formula that we...
- I know all about it!

31
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:39,897
I'll give you another chance.
Your last chance.

32
00:03:39,898 --> 00:03:43,190
- It wasn't our fault.
- Enough!

33
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:46,685
The real formula will arrive
tomorrow.

34
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:53,173
Professor Sorensen.
12:30 p.m. Flight 103.

35
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:55,482
You know what to do.

36
00:03:55,904 --> 00:04:00,224
You take care of everything, Dea.
I'll go with you tomorrow.

37
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:02,286
Yes, boss.

38
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:05,841
There can be no mistakes
this time.

39
00:04:05,842 --> 00:04:08,825
There won't be, sir.

40
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:37,263
<i>International
Hotel.</i>

41
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:55,794
- Thank you. That'll be all.
- At your service, sir.

42
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:41,501
The lady who arrived first?

43
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:45,884
Come in, please.

44
00:08:52,613 --> 00:08:56,988
- Take a seat, please.
- Thank you.

45
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:04,116
- Name, please?
- Angélica Robles, sir.

46
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:08,996
Do you have any experience
doing this kind of work?

47
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:13,268
Yes, I spent three years as a nurse
and secretary to Dr. Benavides.

48
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,807
The psychoanalyst.

49
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:18,201
That's interesting.

50
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:22,489
Why did you leave that job?

51
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,019
The Doctor retired and moved
to Europe.

52
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,515
I see.

53
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:33,796
This is the recommendation letter
from Dr. Benavides.

54
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:44,453
Your former employer holds you
in quite high regard, miss.

55
00:09:46,457 --> 00:09:49,634
You have no family, do you?

56
00:09:49,635 --> 00:09:52,218
No, sir.

57
00:09:52,219 --> 00:09:55,689
I'm all alone in the world.

58
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,272
Miss...

59
00:09:57,273 --> 00:10:01,392
Please inform the other applicants
that the position has been filled.

60
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:09,704
Thank you so much, Doctor!
I really need this job.

61
00:10:09,705 --> 00:10:13,951
- I will try to do my best.
- I'm sure you will.

62
00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:20,104
I'm sorry, ladies, but the
opening has been filled.

63
00:10:31,156 --> 00:10:33,979
When do I begin?

64
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,426
Right now.

65
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:50,459
If that's... okay with you.

66
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:55,185
I'm... at your...

67
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:59,786
command.

68
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:13,333
The others have just left.

69
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,233
Thank you, Devil King.

70
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:57,129
Father of Evil, King of the Dead.

71
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:01,865
I take the soul and the body
you have entrusted me.

72
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:09,477
May its soul remain faithful
to you for all eternity.

73
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:40,983
Unbelievable!

74
00:14:40,984 --> 00:14:43,855
Professor Sorensen
has been murdered?

75
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:48,148
Wait for me.
I'll be right over.

76
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:30,357
From now on, you no longer
possess a will of your own...

77
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:36,458
or any memory of your existence
in the world of the living.

78
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:42,375
You will obey my orders...

79
00:15:42,848 --> 00:15:48,903
and you will worship
the Devil King.

80
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:53,568
And you will refer to me...

81
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:55,752
as "My master".

82
00:15:55,934 --> 00:16:01,902
You are my master.
Command and I will obey.

83
00:16:07,857 --> 00:16:10,936
It seems Sorensen opened
the door with his own key...

84
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,750
which is still in the keyhole.

85
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:15,287
Any prints? Anything missing?

86
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:19,054
Only a black briefcase,
and his travel documents.

87
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:23,018
We found his prints on the
gun, but none on the knife.

88
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:26,660
Besides, the receptionist said
she didn't see anyone enter.

89
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:30,033
Inform INTERPOL Tokyo.
I'll expect a reply by tonight.

90
00:16:30,034 --> 00:16:32,434
Meanwhile, we must investigate
those suspects who were...

91
00:16:32,435 --> 00:16:34,893
at the airport when the
Professor arrived.

92
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:36,375
Goodbye.

93
00:17:50,715 --> 00:17:53,911
You have a very important
mission.

94
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:56,751
Command, and we'll obey.

95
00:17:57,245 --> 00:18:02,334
I want to know the whereabouts
of Yei Lin, the wizard...

96
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:05,918
enemy of our Lord,
the Devil King.

97
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,214
We will search
and we will find him.

98
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:04,993
- You've done well this time.
- Thank you, sir.

99
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:06,679
It was easy, sir.

100
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,928
- Only we had to...
- I understand.

101
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:12,833
Sorensen has been reunited
with his ancestors.

102
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:17,229
Be careful. INTERPOL and the
police are looking for the criminal.

103
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,006
- Is this the formula?
- This is the one.

104
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:22,726
Bromine, zinc, nickel...

105
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:26,799
Almost all inferior metals
can be transmuted into gold.

106
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,177
My friends will have
all they'll ever need.

107
00:19:30,178 --> 00:19:32,424
Provided that the formula works.

108
00:19:32,425 --> 00:19:35,864
You too will have
a lot of gold.

109
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:42,694
Gold was created by the Devil King
to control the souls of men...

110
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:46,926
but it turned out to be
stronger than its creator.

111
00:19:46,927 --> 00:19:49,684
I figured that out...

112
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:53,397
and I will become more
powerful than the Devil King.

113
00:19:53,398 --> 00:19:58,780
Here I will control gold.
Gold, to us, means power.

114
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:02,691
With it, we can buy
consciences and souls.

115
00:20:03,563 --> 00:20:07,187
The world will be in our hands.

116
00:20:07,188 --> 00:20:10,858
Inspector! I'm all done with
the cyphering from Tokyo.

117
00:20:11,417 --> 00:20:13,623
Bring it to me at once.

118
00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:33,088
"Sorensen left four days ago,
destination Mexico".

119
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:37,588
"Unknown agent also flew to
Mexico from Hong Kong".

120
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:40,797
"Passport name Yei Lin".

121
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:46,987
"Reliable sources confirm Yei Lin
intends to steal Sorensen formula".

122
00:20:46,988 --> 00:20:51,716
- Anything else, Inspector?
- No. You may go.

123
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,939
Captain Mendía,
please report to my office.

124
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,818
<i>International Bank.</i>

125
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,917
I think the formula is correct.

126
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:37,285
I did some minimum-scale
tests, and this was the result.

127
00:21:37,286 --> 00:21:39,604
What metal is that?

128
00:21:39,605 --> 00:21:41,547
Gold.

129
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:44,796
Pure gold.
No doubt about it.

130
00:21:44,797 --> 00:21:49,597
- We did it. Success!
- No. Not yet.

131
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:52,955
We need to set up a
large-scale laboratory.

132
00:21:52,956 --> 00:21:56,356
Marco, you will round up
the materials.

133
00:21:56,357 --> 00:22:01,179
And Sergio, you will find a suitable
location for the lab.

134
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:06,738
And now, let's get some rest.
It's been a fruitful day.

135
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:10,194
- Is the alarm system on?
- Of course.

136
00:22:14,657 --> 00:22:18,633
- I'll have a look at the garden.
- I'll check the rest of the house.

137
00:24:41,632 --> 00:24:46,345
- We have obeyed your command.
- We found Yei Lin.

138
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,881
- Where?
- A house on Road 32.

139
00:24:50,882 --> 00:24:57,393
But they will leave soon.
Medusa had to kill one of his men.

140
00:24:57,394 --> 00:25:00,920
- How many left?
- One man and one woman.

141
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:04,601
Yei Lin possesses
the Sorensen formula.

142
00:25:04,602 --> 00:25:08,329
He murdered the Professor
and stole it.

143
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:12,033
The Sorensen formula.

144
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:17,640
Wonderful!
It's all so clear.

145
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:22,239
Yei Lin was turning lesser
metals into gold.

146
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,222
I'm beginning to understand
just what kind of foe Yei Lin is.

147
00:25:28,051 --> 00:25:32,268
- I am pleased.
- Thank you, Master.

148
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:04,483
Gold. All the gold I want.

149
00:26:04,484 --> 00:26:10,299
I will most certainly carry out
your orders, Devil King.

150
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,947
We have the whole city
under surveillance.

151
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:18,372
Sooner or later, Yei Lin will fall.

152
00:26:18,373 --> 00:26:20,593
<i>What about the other one?</i>

153
00:26:20,594 --> 00:26:23,912
Still nothing.

154
00:27:14,783 --> 00:27:17,496
I need you.

155
00:27:17,497 --> 00:27:20,479
You will watch Yei Lin's house.

156
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,639
When the time comes,
I will deal with him myself.

157
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:12,201
This is how the Devil King
responds to your challenge.

158
00:30:12,202 --> 00:30:17,345
With death, Yei Lin!

159
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:29,415
No human being can survive
this poison!

160
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:22,030
<i>What's happening, Yei Lin?
Open the door!</i>

161
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:24,462
<i>Marco!</i>

162
00:31:24,463 --> 00:31:27,151
<i>Kick the door down!</i>

163
00:31:30,016 --> 00:31:31,856
What's going on here?

164
00:31:33,552 --> 00:31:35,495
Nothing too serious.

165
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:40,742
I was only giving the Devil King
a display of my great power.

166
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:02,350
- How do you feel, Master?
- Much better.

167
00:32:02,351 --> 00:32:05,960
Where did that bat come from?

168
00:32:05,961 --> 00:32:11,736
That was Yei Lin himself.
He can shapeshift at nights.

169
00:32:11,737 --> 00:32:14,332
He's a master of black magic.

170
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:17,787
That's why he dares to
challenge the Devil King.

171
00:32:17,788 --> 00:32:20,437
How will we kill him?

172
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:24,437
According to tradition...

173
00:32:24,438 --> 00:32:28,213
this kind of wizard can only
be killed...

174
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:31,846
by driving a wooden stake
through his heart.

175
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:34,892
But...

176
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:43,372
I'll come up with a much
crueller death for him.

177
00:32:52,283 --> 00:32:55,820
- We're too late.
- Yeah, the birds have flown.

178
00:32:55,855 --> 00:32:57,504
Something frightened them.

179
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:00,520
Too bad.
We were on the right track.

180
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:02,463
We're right where we started.

181
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,990
Unless they gave us
the wrong address.

182
00:33:05,991 --> 00:33:09,830
No, this is the one, no doubt.

183
00:33:14,101 --> 00:33:17,295
- Bianchi.
- Yes, what is it?

184
00:33:17,296 --> 00:33:20,192
What would you say this is?

185
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:26,434
- I'd say it's metal. Lead or zinc.
- But what does it mean?

186
00:33:26,435 --> 00:33:30,640
It means Yei Lin is testing
the Sorensen formula.

187
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:36,388
Now I'm certain that he or
his men killed Prof. Sorensen.

188
00:33:36,423 --> 00:33:38,135
That much is clear.

189
00:33:48,491 --> 00:33:51,611
- Did you find out?
- Yes, Master.

190
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,874
They left that house and
took a floor...

191
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:57,899
in the tower in the center
of the city.

192
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,939
What did you find out?

193
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,922
They've delivered many boxes
branded with the name...

194
00:34:02,923 --> 00:34:05,362
of an electronics factory.

195
00:34:05,363 --> 00:34:08,905
The Sorensen formula.

196
00:34:08,906 --> 00:34:12,003
Yei Lin means to do some
large-scale research.

197
00:34:12,038 --> 00:34:14,563
What shall we do, Master?

198
00:34:14,564 --> 00:34:18,634
We'll watch, and we'll wait.

199
00:34:18,635 --> 00:34:23,209
We must let them get set up
and feel confident.

200
00:34:24,713 --> 00:34:29,378
Then they'll find out
who Dr. Satán is.

201
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:36,313
Why did you call me so
urgently?

202
00:34:36,314 --> 00:34:39,378
We have news about the metal
purveyors.

203
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:43,641
One of them sold a large amount
of zinc, lead and nickel...

204
00:34:43,642 --> 00:34:45,769
to a private individual.

205
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:48,608
Could it have been a
manufacturer?

206
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:53,551
No, we checked.
It must be for Yei Lin.

207
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:56,363
And what about our other man?

208
00:34:56,364 --> 00:35:00,635
Nothing at all. It's as if the
earth had swallowed him.

209
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:03,931
Then we'll go there ourselves.

210
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:22,307
- Marco's got news.
- What is it now?

211
00:35:22,342 --> 00:35:27,004
Our enemies know we have
settled in this place.

212
00:35:27,005 --> 00:35:29,340
- That could be dangerous!
- Of course.

213
00:35:29,341 --> 00:35:34,436
But Marco's been watching them,
and we know where they hide.

214
00:35:34,437 --> 00:35:36,959
What are your orders?

215
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,599
Eliminate them before we start
our large-scale experiments.

216
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,335
Marco and I will take care
of it.

217
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:47,432
No.

218
00:35:48,048 --> 00:35:52,949
I'll do it myself.
It'll be my pleasure.

219
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:19,092
Zombies?

220
00:36:19,127 --> 00:36:21,076
Disgusting.

221
00:36:58,185 --> 00:37:00,283
Did you find what you were
looking for?

222
00:37:04,252 --> 00:37:07,533
We meet again, Doctor.

223
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:13,703
So it seems. Only this time
you won't be so lucky.

224
00:37:13,704 --> 00:37:15,752
Perhaps.

225
00:37:15,753 --> 00:37:18,591
But who knows?

226
00:37:18,592 --> 00:37:22,031
Together, you and I would
be invincible.

227
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:26,510
You mean we'd share the secrets
of the Sorensen formula?

228
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:31,198
Exactly!
That's what I propose!

229
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,259
You overestimate yourself,
Yei Lin.

230
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:40,435
- Won't you consider my proposal?
- No.

231
00:37:40,436 --> 00:37:44,156
My only mission is to take
that formula from you...

232
00:37:44,157 --> 00:37:49,091
and to destroy you.
And that's what I'll do.

233
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:55,076
I'm sorry to hear that, Doctor.
We would have been a great team.

234
00:39:01,302 --> 00:39:03,377
Come closer.

235
00:39:16,013 --> 00:39:19,582
Put me on the table.

236
00:39:36,648 --> 00:39:42,336
XX-38.
It's in the safe.

237
00:39:42,337 --> 00:39:46,816
Quick.
Inject me.

238
00:40:10,052 --> 00:40:11,981
Quick.

239
00:40:11,982 --> 00:40:14,805
Quick!

240
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:32,157
Devil King!

241
00:40:32,158 --> 00:40:36,190
My lord and master...

242
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:37,951
I need you!

243
00:41:20,091 --> 00:41:24,867
We must time it precisely.
Three minutes of bombardment.

244
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,647
<i>Eastern Imports Inc.</i>

245
00:42:05,307 --> 00:42:09,147
- Good evening, miss.
- Good evening.

246
00:42:09,148 --> 00:42:10,652
What's that?

247
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,891
Oh, Mr. Lin is testing some
new equipment.

248
00:42:12,892 --> 00:42:15,371
It arrived just today
from the East.

249
00:42:15,372 --> 00:42:18,769
Excuse me, miss, but I must
investigate personally...

250
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,466
just to see there are no
safety threats to the building. 

251
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:23,631
As you wish, but...

252
00:42:23,632 --> 00:42:28,102
the test will be over in a
moment. Take a seat, please.

253
00:42:28,103 --> 00:42:29,103
Thank you.

254
00:42:58,938 --> 00:43:00,681
Don't!

255
00:43:00,682 --> 00:43:03,625
It's still radioactive.

256
00:43:04,745 --> 00:43:08,341
I did it.
I did it!

257
00:43:08,342 --> 00:43:11,956
It's gold!
And having gold is like...

258
00:43:11,957 --> 00:43:14,498
like having the world in
my hands!

259
00:43:14,533 --> 00:43:17,483
Look, Dea!

260
00:43:17,484 --> 00:43:21,717
- All this is gold.
- It's wonderful!

261
00:43:23,686 --> 00:43:27,390
But... I had some problems
outside.

262
00:43:27,391 --> 00:43:30,162
The guard was stubborn,
so I had to take care of him.

263
00:43:30,197 --> 00:43:31,458
Dead?

264
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:51,053
Pure gold, without a doubt.
It's pure gold, Dea!

265
00:43:53,778 --> 00:43:55,995
Put him on the table.

266
00:44:11,018 --> 00:44:14,867
Cover your eyes, Dea.
You can go blind.

267
00:45:22,117 --> 00:45:26,033
Our secret will be safe.

268
00:45:34,697 --> 00:45:36,500
Medusa.

269
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:46,535
We have work to do.

270
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:51,095
We have to repay
Yei Lin's attentions.

271
00:45:51,096 --> 00:45:54,022
Command, and I'll obey, Master.

272
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,938
Where am I?

273
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:10,704
Who are you?

274
00:47:13,216 --> 00:47:16,383
- Answer me!
- I will, miss.

275
00:47:16,384 --> 00:47:22,206
- You must be Dr. Satán.
- Yes, I am.

276
00:47:22,207 --> 00:47:27,023
And you're Dea,
Yei Lin's right hand woman.

277
00:47:27,024 --> 00:47:29,891
I'm just a mere servant.

278
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:34,252
Don't try to deceive me.
I know who you are.

279
00:47:34,253 --> 00:47:36,923
Why have you kidnapped me?

280
00:47:37,907 --> 00:47:42,322
Because I want the Sorensen
formula...

281
00:47:42,323 --> 00:47:46,400
and the life of my enemy
Yei Lin.

282
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:51,707
We may be able to reach
an understanding.

283
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:56,194
That sounds interesting.
I'm listening.

284
00:47:56,195 --> 00:47:58,377
In private.

285
00:47:58,829 --> 00:48:00,765
Okay.

286
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:16,075
I like being on the winning side.

287
00:48:16,076 --> 00:48:19,995
Good for you.
That's a very wise attitude.

288
00:48:19,996 --> 00:48:24,258
And I could be of great service
to a man as powerful...

289
00:48:24,259 --> 00:48:27,153
and as pleasant as you.

290
00:48:29,441 --> 00:48:32,521
Let's talk about business first.

291
00:48:32,522 --> 00:48:36,761
And then, about some
other things...

292
00:48:36,762 --> 00:48:38,576
Perhaps.

293
00:48:39,051 --> 00:48:42,075
What do you want from me?

294
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:45,956
Call Yei Lin...

295
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:50,292
and tell him that, if he wants
to see you alive again...

296
00:48:50,293 --> 00:48:53,804
he must give me the
Sorensen formula.

297
00:48:54,887 --> 00:48:59,844
If I do that, can I trust you?

298
00:48:59,845 --> 00:49:03,066
Can I trust you?

299
00:49:03,067 --> 00:49:05,546
Fine.

300
00:49:05,547 --> 00:49:07,852
I'll prove my loyalty to you.

301
00:49:33,081 --> 00:49:34,272
Hello?

302
00:49:34,273 --> 00:49:38,591
This is Dea. I'm being held
prisoner by Dr. Satán.

303
00:49:38,592 --> 00:49:42,415
He says he'll kill me if you don't
give him the formula.

304
00:49:44,726 --> 00:49:47,628
Your beautiful accomplice is
telling the truth.

305
00:49:47,629 --> 00:49:51,755
How can I believe you?
I know you want to kill me.

306
00:49:51,756 --> 00:49:54,219
All I care about now is
the formula.

307
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:58,673
As soon as I have it, I will
give you Dea back. Alive.

308
00:49:58,674 --> 00:50:00,818
I want a guarantee.

309
00:50:00,819 --> 00:50:04,424
I need Dea, but I won't be tricked
by you.

310
00:50:04,425 --> 00:50:07,688
No, no tricks.

311
00:50:07,689 --> 00:50:10,119
If you want to see her again...

312
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,221
do exactly as I say.

313
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,510
I'll be there.

314
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:56,777
- No tricks. As promised.
- So it would seem.

315
00:50:56,778 --> 00:50:58,733
I too have done my part.

316
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:03,447
I trust you weren't foolish
enough to give me a fake formula.

317
00:51:03,448 --> 00:51:07,015
No, Doctor.
I know your power.

318
00:51:07,016 --> 00:51:13,198
I thought I'd killed you, and yet...
Here you are, alive and well.

319
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:15,382
That's right.

320
00:51:15,383 --> 00:51:18,568
Now, I want you to know
I've injected Dea...

321
00:51:18,569 --> 00:51:21,655
with a very powerful venom.

322
00:51:22,386 --> 00:51:25,632
- Is that true?
- It is.

323
00:51:25,633 --> 00:51:28,464
- Then you did trick me!
- Wait a moment.

324
00:51:28,465 --> 00:51:30,934
That venom can be counteracted...

325
00:51:30,935 --> 00:51:34,359
if an antidote is given within
48 hours.

326
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,253
What is that antidote? Speak!

327
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:43,158
If the formula is real, I will
tell you before that time.

328
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:45,991
Fine, Dr. Satán.

329
00:51:46,414 --> 00:51:51,224
I gave you the formula, and I hope
you'll soon give me the antidote.

330
00:51:51,225 --> 00:51:55,638
After that happens,
we will meet again, Doctor.

331
00:51:56,212 --> 00:51:59,190
That's right, Yei Lin.

332
00:51:59,191 --> 00:52:05,282
The world is too small for
both of us.

333
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,762
Hello?
Yes, it's me.

334
00:52:24,763 --> 00:52:28,601
Yeah, you delivered.
The formula is correct.

335
00:52:28,602 --> 00:52:32,674
- What about the antidote?
- The antidote?

336
00:52:32,923 --> 00:52:35,963
You don't need any antidote.

337
00:52:35,964 --> 00:52:40,185
Dea's injection was just water.
Distilled water, to boot.

338
00:52:40,186 --> 00:52:42,620
See you soon, Yei Lin.

339
00:52:46,428 --> 00:52:49,556
See you soon, Dr. Satán.

340
00:52:49,557 --> 00:52:53,932
I'll take the pleasure of killing
you with my own hands.

341
00:52:55,499 --> 00:52:59,669
- Have we been fooled?
- No.

342
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:05,584
We merely won a battle.
I will win the war.

343
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:09,449
- Did you give him the real formula?
- Yes. Why?

344
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:11,587
Then we are doomed.

345
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:13,123
No.

346
00:53:13,124 --> 00:53:18,267
I made a small alteration to the
atomic bombardment time.

347
00:53:18,268 --> 00:53:23,986
When he tries it, he won't
stop the bombardment in time...

348
00:53:23,987 --> 00:53:26,915
and after two minutes...

349
00:53:26,916 --> 00:53:32,419
everything will be blown
to pieces!

350
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,212
- It's time.
- We're right on time.

351
00:53:53,213 --> 00:53:55,805
- Go get the gold.
- Right away.

352
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:58,715
He must have an emergency
shelter there.

353
00:54:58,716 --> 00:55:00,667
What will we do, Master?

354
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,834
We'll keep an eye on them...

355
00:55:02,835 --> 00:55:05,713
and wait for the chance to
get rid of Yei Lin.

356
00:55:05,714 --> 00:55:09,081
- We'll get closer to them?
- Yes.

357
00:55:09,082 --> 00:55:12,145
With all due caution.

358
00:55:17,352 --> 00:55:22,993
This is Red Bird to Nest.
Red Bird to Nest.

359
00:55:22,994 --> 00:55:28,922
- Red Bird to Nest.
- This is Nest. Come in, Red Bird.

360
00:55:28,923 --> 00:55:33,552
Immediate report:
Sorensen was a success.

361
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,385
We can have all the metal
we want.

362
00:55:40,386 --> 00:55:42,378
Repeat: Positive results.

363
00:55:42,379 --> 00:55:46,523
Metal, any amount at our disposal.
Over.

364
00:55:46,524 --> 00:55:49,055
Report: Very satisfactory.

365
00:55:49,056 --> 00:55:52,776
Proceed in sending samples
of metal. Over.

366
00:55:52,777 --> 00:55:56,494
The sample of the metal will
go out through the south border.

367
00:56:07,872 --> 00:56:11,477
Any instructions for me?
Over.

368
00:56:11,478 --> 00:56:13,613
Proceed to return.

369
00:56:13,614 --> 00:56:17,950
Everything will be settled
by the usual means. Over.

370
00:56:17,951 --> 00:56:23,004
Understood. I'll destroy
everything, as planned. Out.

371
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:27,181
- I think they're pleased.
- Quite. And with good reason!

372
00:56:44,011 --> 00:56:46,953
- The helicopter!
- Right on time.

373
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:50,259
We'll deliver the gold and
leave as quickly as possible.

374
00:57:07,466 --> 00:57:10,569
Eveything is ready to blow up.

375
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:12,817
Marco!

376
00:57:14,499 --> 00:57:17,483
Marco, come get the gold.
They're almost here.

377
00:57:17,484 --> 00:57:19,938
Marco, can't you hear me?

378
00:57:19,939 --> 00:57:23,226
Marco can no longer obey
you, honorable Yei Lin.

379
00:57:23,261 --> 00:57:26,315
- You again!
- Yes. Me, all the time.

380
00:57:26,316 --> 00:57:27,866
Open that suitcase.

381
00:57:28,976 --> 00:57:31,110
You won't get away with this,
Doctor.

382
00:57:31,111 --> 00:57:34,367
- You know what to do if they move.
- Yes, Master.

383
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,882
- Sorensen gold seems fine.
- It is, Doctor.

384
00:57:45,883 --> 00:57:47,724
As fine as the finest.

385
00:57:47,725 --> 00:57:51,400
All the crimes you commited
in order to get the formula...

386
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:56,674
Was it personal greed?
Or do you serve higher interests?

387
00:57:56,675 --> 00:58:01,837
An interesting puzzle for your
great intellect to solve, Doctor.

388
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:05,192
Too bad you won't be able to
enjoy the results your efforts...

389
00:58:05,193 --> 00:58:07,626
because you will die, Yei Lin.

390
00:58:07,627 --> 00:58:11,404
Life is but a transit, Doctor.
You know that.

391
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:15,305
You can't die without your
master's consent!

392
00:58:15,306 --> 00:58:18,033
And you can't live without
serving others!

393
00:58:18,034 --> 00:58:20,942
Life is a constant act of service,
Doctor.

394
00:58:21,654 --> 00:58:22,704
Now!

395
00:58:22,705 --> 00:58:24,897
Shoot!

396
00:58:41,753 --> 00:58:45,394
- I won once again.
- Naturally.

397
00:58:45,395 --> 00:58:49,435
- Do we have to go inside?
- Of course. We must make sure.

398
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:06,086
Goodbye, Dr. Satán.

399
00:59:06,087 --> 00:59:09,926
It was a pleasure to fight
an enemy like you.

400
00:59:09,927 --> 00:59:12,751
What about the gold?
It's underneath all that!

401
00:59:12,752 --> 00:59:17,519
So what? We can have all
the gold we want.

402
00:59:34,684 --> 00:59:37,414
Look! The helicopter is leaving!

403
00:59:37,415 --> 00:59:40,277
The cave's collapse must
have startled them.

404
00:59:45,512 --> 00:59:49,239
- Wise of them to take no chances.
- We'll have to explain this to Nest.

405
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:55,729
Of course. We have the formula.
It's a complete victory.

406
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:38,663
Devil King! I heard
your call, and here I am.

407
01:00:38,664 --> 01:00:41,474
Plutarco Satán!

408
01:00:42,193 --> 01:00:47,594
You have failed. Yei Lin is alive.

409
01:00:49,368 --> 01:00:54,064
He's cunning, my lord.
But I'll fulfill your orders soon.

410
01:00:54,065 --> 01:01:00,198
You shall never have eternal rest.
I curse you!

411
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:05,791
No! Wait!
Give me one last chance!

412
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:11,174
If you haven't obtained
the Sorensen formula...

413
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:15,136
and killed Yei Lin by next
full moon...

414
01:01:15,137 --> 01:01:18,061
you will know the full
power of my wrath!

415
01:01:18,062 --> 01:01:22,373
You'll have the formula,
and Yei Lin will die.

416
01:01:22,374 --> 01:01:25,322
Make it so.

417
01:02:00,673 --> 01:02:03,657
Here's to our triumph,
and to you...

418
01:02:03,658 --> 01:02:06,633
beautiful as a lotus flower.

419
01:02:06,634 --> 01:02:10,986
Here's to you, the strongest
and wisest of all men.

420
01:02:10,987 --> 01:02:15,291
- You are very kind.
- I'm happy.

421
01:02:15,292 --> 01:02:18,384
Soon, you'll be the richest
woman in the world.

422
01:02:18,385 --> 01:02:21,688
Whatever you want, you shall have
just by saying the word.

423
01:02:21,689 --> 01:02:25,312
And you'll be the most
powerful man in the world.

424
01:02:25,313 --> 01:02:30,024
Our future couldn't look better.

425
01:02:30,233 --> 01:02:34,081
Honorable sir, there's
someone here to see you.

426
01:02:34,082 --> 01:02:38,251
Tell him I'm can't see him now.
Teatime is sacred.

427
01:02:38,252 --> 01:02:40,941
He says he's a policeman.

428
01:02:40,976 --> 01:02:43,546
What are we going to do?

429
01:02:43,547 --> 01:02:45,847
We'll remain calm.

430
01:02:45,848 --> 01:02:50,335
Go tell the man I'll be
honored to see him.

431
01:02:52,623 --> 01:02:57,056
Smile, please.
You're much prettier that way.

432
01:03:03,601 --> 01:03:06,073
Good evening.

433
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:09,345
Good evening, officer.

434
01:03:11,002 --> 01:03:15,449
May I ask why you honor my
humble house with your visit?

435
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:17,231
I'm sorry to disturb you...

436
01:03:17,232 --> 01:03:21,728
but INTERPOL Inspector Bianchi
wants to see you.

437
01:03:21,729 --> 01:03:25,103
Have I commited a crime
I'm not aware of?

438
01:03:25,104 --> 01:03:27,038
I don't know, sir.

439
01:03:27,073 --> 01:03:31,637
Tell the respectable Inspector
I'll go to his office tomorrow.

440
01:03:31,638 --> 01:03:34,784
I'm afraid it has to be
right now.

441
01:03:36,047 --> 01:03:38,320
Ah, I know. Orders are orders.

442
01:03:38,321 --> 01:03:39,705
Can I at least change clothes?

443
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:43,947
I'm afraid that's not possible.
You must come with me at once.

444
01:03:43,948 --> 01:03:47,355
I respect the law and
its agents.

445
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:50,360
I'm at your service.

446
01:03:50,361 --> 01:03:51,765
After you.

447
01:03:58,949 --> 01:04:01,870
Good job, darling.

448
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:06,914
Thank you, my master.
What shall we do with the body?

449
01:04:06,915 --> 01:04:10,001
We'll reunite him with his
ancestors...

450
01:04:10,002 --> 01:04:13,304
after a convenient disintegration.

451
01:04:13,305 --> 01:04:15,054
When?

452
01:04:15,055 --> 01:04:18,766
After we've finished our tea.

453
01:04:20,716 --> 01:04:25,420
What a shame. That idiot
stained my best carpet.

454
01:04:25,421 --> 01:04:27,625
We must get rid of him
immediately.

455
01:04:27,626 --> 01:04:31,784
His superiors will send for him
as soon as they notice his absence.

456
01:04:32,373 --> 01:04:35,805
You're beautiful and wise, Dea.

457
01:04:35,806 --> 01:04:38,388
We'll do as you say.

458
01:04:38,389 --> 01:04:44,429
But not before we've enjoyed
our sacred beverage.

459
01:05:16,854 --> 01:05:20,431
- Good afternoon.
- Hi, there.

460
01:05:20,432 --> 01:05:24,967
- Are you in charge of this office?
- Can't you tell?

461
01:05:24,968 --> 01:05:30,205
- I'm sorry to interrupt your break.
- Too late. What do you want?

462
01:05:30,206 --> 01:05:33,533
I'd like to rent a plane for
a special trip.

463
01:05:33,534 --> 01:05:35,612
We don't have any.

464
01:05:35,613 --> 01:05:40,031
Would you mind asking the manager
if there is a craft available?

465
01:05:40,032 --> 01:05:43,192
I told you we don't have any.

466
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:55,080
Tell him that Red Bird sent me.

467
01:05:57,414 --> 01:06:00,766
It'll be a waste of both
of our times.

468
01:06:16,195 --> 01:06:20,072
Yes, boss...
Yes, boss.

469
01:06:21,629 --> 01:06:25,951
The boss says the plane
will be ready by 9 p.m.

470
01:06:25,952 --> 01:06:28,118
Thank you.

471
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:31,654
You are amazingly kind.

472
01:07:00,214 --> 01:07:02,365
What do you want?

473
01:07:02,366 --> 01:07:06,734
- Some minor reports.
- You got the wrong office.

474
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:10,894
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

475
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:20,660
What would you like to know, sir?

476
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:22,852
Nothing much.

477
01:07:24,564 --> 01:07:28,644
All the arrangements are made.
A plane will take us to the border.

478
01:07:28,645 --> 01:07:33,180
In two days, we'll be in the East,
with the formula in our hands.

479
01:07:33,181 --> 01:07:36,527
I'll be relieved when we leave
the country.

480
01:07:36,528 --> 01:07:41,062
- No news of him?
- What news could there be?

481
01:07:41,063 --> 01:07:44,004
Dr. Satán is dead.

482
01:07:44,005 --> 01:07:49,349
And the dead don't talk,
and don't haunt the living.

483
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:53,923
I still can't believe it.
That man was terrible.

484
01:07:53,924 --> 01:07:56,161
He seemed indestructible.

485
01:07:56,162 --> 01:08:00,313
Nobody can fight me and live
to tell the tale.

486
01:08:00,348 --> 01:08:02,433
I know.

487
01:08:06,436 --> 01:08:09,299
Come on. We have work.

488
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,933
We must destroy the equipment
and get away from here.

489
01:08:11,934 --> 01:08:15,981
The police are closing in.
We can't give them anything.

490
01:08:15,982 --> 01:08:19,388
- Yes, my master.
- Let's go.

491
01:08:22,099 --> 01:08:26,773
720 to HQ.
720 to HQ.

492
01:08:26,774 --> 01:08:29,939
Come in, 720.
HQ is listening.

493
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:32,531
The Easterner is in his office.

494
01:08:32,532 --> 01:08:36,277
I followed him from a building
near the airport.

495
01:08:37,224 --> 01:08:41,526
Good. Don't let him out of your
sight. We'll be over in ten minutes.

496
01:08:44,282 --> 01:08:47,582
We'll surround the whole block.
Yei Lin will have to...

497
01:08:47,617 --> 01:08:51,556
perform a miracle if he expects
to escape us this time.

498
01:08:54,573 --> 01:08:57,108
I'll give the general alarm.

499
01:08:59,024 --> 01:09:02,728
We'll go find Yei Lin
and destroy him.

500
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:04,512
I don't have much time.

501
01:09:04,513 --> 01:09:07,921
- Is he in the same building?
- Yes, in his laboratory.

502
01:09:07,922 --> 01:09:11,269
Getting ready to leave
the country.

503
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:14,605
- Yei Lin will be wary.
- Why should he?

504
01:09:14,606 --> 01:09:17,605
He thinks I'm dead.
He has nothing to fear.

505
01:09:17,606 --> 01:09:19,759
He won't be expecting our visit.

506
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:23,390
You're right as usual,
my master.

507
01:09:25,231 --> 01:09:28,479
After tonight...

508
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:33,056
the both of you will have
eternal rest.

509
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:49,395
No news.
The man is still in his offices.

510
01:09:49,396 --> 01:09:53,579
Good. Everybody stand by.
When we're ready, we'll get him.

511
01:10:07,978 --> 01:10:13,218
The microfilm will be easy to hide.
Then, we'll destroy the book.

512
01:10:13,219 --> 01:10:16,205
I wonder what happened to the
copy you gave Dr. Satán.

513
01:10:16,206 --> 01:10:20,997
- It must have perished with him.
- What if it didn't?

514
01:10:20,998 --> 01:10:24,813
Then whoever finds it will get
a huge surprise.

515
01:10:24,814 --> 01:10:27,238
Why do you say that?

516
01:10:27,239 --> 01:10:32,214
Remember, I put in an excess in
the bombardment time of the metal.

517
01:10:32,215 --> 01:10:38,108
After 5 minutes of bombardment,
the cannon becomes a nuclear bomb.

518
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:41,645
A small one.
Everything will blow up.

519
01:10:41,646 --> 01:10:45,037
You're right. It seems every
risk is taken care of.

520
01:10:45,038 --> 01:10:47,029
Of course.

521
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:53,070
When Yei Lin works,
he works risk-free.

522
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:18,729
All set, sirs. Not even a rat
can escape our perimeter fence.

523
01:11:18,764 --> 01:11:20,896
Good. Let's go get him, then.

524
01:11:20,897 --> 01:11:23,031
Wait.

525
01:11:26,643 --> 01:11:28,810
We'll wait for a while.

526
01:11:28,811 --> 01:11:32,460
It seems Yei Lin has some
very interesting visitors.

527
01:11:32,461 --> 01:11:35,079
It could be the other man
we're looking for.

528
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:40,759
Do you realize the power
of science?

529
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:47,128
This tiny film contains
the whole Sorensen formula.

530
01:11:53,192 --> 01:11:56,990
Our bosses will have
a right to be pleased with us.

531
01:11:56,991 --> 01:12:01,190
Of course! We're giving them all
the gold in the world.

532
01:12:01,191 --> 01:12:05,806
Which means all the power.

533
01:12:05,807 --> 01:12:11,881
- Our reward will be huge.
- And the thrill of a job well done.

534
01:12:11,882 --> 01:12:14,526
Of course.

535
01:12:14,527 --> 01:12:20,399
There are beautiful, long and
peaceful days in our future.

536
01:12:26,337 --> 01:12:30,353
We'll use this timebomb to
destroy the equipment.

537
01:12:52,108 --> 01:12:56,187
And now, let's get out of here.

538
01:12:58,265 --> 01:13:03,968
Could I have a small chat
with you before you leave...

539
01:13:03,969 --> 01:13:05,888
honorable Yei Lin?

540
01:13:05,889 --> 01:13:08,967
- You!
- In the flesh.

541
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:11,231
No! That's impossible!

542
01:13:11,232 --> 01:13:13,351
I can assure you I'm no ghost.

543
01:13:13,386 --> 01:13:15,749
I'm just a man who's here
to settle a score.

544
01:13:15,784 --> 01:13:19,416
Don't bother, Yei Lin.
No black magic!

545
01:13:23,096 --> 01:13:26,986
Don't move!
Don't think I won't shoot.

546
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:43,058
You must go down.
You must die! Damn you!

547
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:46,558
Damn you!

548
01:14:23,095 --> 01:14:25,731
- Shouldn't we just go in?
- No.

549
01:14:25,732 --> 01:14:28,644
I think we'd better wait
for the visitors to come out.

550
01:14:28,645 --> 01:14:33,413
We'll take them quietly,
and then we'll take Yei Lin.

551
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:40,356
And now, you and me,
honorable Yei Lin.

552
01:14:42,412 --> 01:14:45,140
Don't move.

553
01:14:45,141 --> 01:14:52,312
This is my pleasure. I intend to
enjoy it with my own hands.

554
01:14:52,313 --> 01:14:55,428
The pleasure will be mine,
as I destroy you with my own!

555
01:16:18,068 --> 01:16:20,171
Look out, master.

556
01:16:26,265 --> 01:16:29,616
I'm not an easy man to kill,
Dr. Satán.

557
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:31,776
You damned wizard!

558
01:16:31,777 --> 01:16:35,690
You'll only die when a wooden
stake pierces your heart.

559
01:17:32,174 --> 01:17:34,448
Thank you...

560
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:37,879
Devil King.

561
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:41,743
I have carried out your orders.

562
01:17:54,526 --> 01:17:58,040
Our mission has been
accomplished.

563
01:17:58,041 --> 01:18:01,165
You can rest now.

564
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:06,104
Medusa, Erato...

565
01:18:06,105 --> 01:18:11,400
if the Devil King wishes, we'll soon
meet in the Kingdom of Shadows.

566
01:18:11,401 --> 01:18:15,430
Won't you join us in eternal peace?

567
01:18:17,744 --> 01:18:22,208
Our lord and master has
other plans.

568
01:18:22,209 --> 01:18:27,016
First, I must verify that the
Sorensen formula works.

569
01:18:29,845 --> 01:18:34,502
Meet us soon, master.

570
01:21:58,634 --> 01:22:01,943
Only sixty more seconds.

571
01:22:11,708 --> 01:22:17,542
- We mustn't wait anymore.
- Yeah, it's been a while.

572
01:22:17,543 --> 01:22:19,900
Let's get them.
Alert the others.

573
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:57,688
<i>The End.</i>
