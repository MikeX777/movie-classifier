1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,541
The charge of the accused of him murdering his family with intent will now be overturned

2
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:12,500
Due to the accused's state of mind

3
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:14,750
With this, the court has decided to place the accused in the mental institution

4
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:17,750
To be observed by psychiatrist and will not be sent to jail

5
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:29,041
Firefly is on news again.

6
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:30,583
He saves another person.

7
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,707
His news appear on most of the newspapers.

8
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:37,125
He is on the TV news as well.

9
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,416
Huat ah! One cup please.

10
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:43,958
Boss! A lot of customers order AH HUAT White Coffee lately.

11
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:46,500
Boss, three cups of Ah Huat White Coffee please!

12
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,625
You are right.

13
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,583
Yes!

14
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:51,791
Only a few packs left.

15
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:56,042
Better call now to order more Ah Huat White Coffee.

16
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:57,292
Quickly go.

17
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:58,583
Hold on.

18
00:02:58,584 --> 00:03:01,042
You go wash toilet.

19
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,125
Let me serve the customers instead.

20
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,000
Huat ah! It's hot!

21
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:07,875
Huat ah!

22
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:09,375
May your wishes come true.

23
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:10,333
Here you go.

24
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:15,417
Firefly is very capable.

25
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,333
That's true.

26
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:20,167
Heard that he can fly like Superman.

27
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:24,542
I heard that he is six feet tall.

28
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:31,875
Then he must be very handsome.

29
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,042
Then he must be very manly too!

30
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:43,208
What do you think you are doing!?

31
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:45,458
I have no appetite anymore.

32
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,208
You are so gross.

33
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,957
Please move away.

34
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,791
Yes, I'm the one they are referring to.

35
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:57,250
Your one and only helpful hero.

36
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:59,625
Firefly!

37
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:17,791
Help!

38
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:18,999
Sir, help me!

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,791
There are 2 men who are chasing after me!

40
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,083
Please help me.

41
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,916
I can't help you, sorry

42
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,416
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:34,875
Please don't come near me.

44
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,583
Go on... run if you can.

45
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,832
Help!

46
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,625
Don't come near me.

47
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,708
Don't touch me, go away.

48
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,583
Wei, don't disturb her.

49
00:04:56,666 --> 00:05:00,166
I've just spent 15 minutes to climb up, now I have to climb back down again.

50
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:01,875
Go away.

51
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,750
Go away.

52
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,333
Let her go.

53
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,333
Or else, I'll beat you both.

54
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,416
What's the time now? Wearing like this at this hour?

55
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,791
Don't look like Batman nor Superman.

56
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,082
Which kind of "man" are you?

57
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,750
I'm none of the so called "Man".

58
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,208
Don't be scared when I tell you who I really am.

59
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,208
I'm the hero who likes to help and save people.

60
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,458
I'm Firefly!

61
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,000
You heard his name before?

62
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,791
Maybe... maybe not.

63
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,125
Uncle, I never heard of this name.

64
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,875
But I know there are a lof of Firefllies in Kuala Selangor.

65
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,291
You...

66
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:54,208
What?

67
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,750
There is a cockroach on your finger!

68
00:05:57,583 --> 00:06:00,416
Cockroach! Cockroach!

69
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:08,125
It's gone.

70
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:09,416
It flies to his head!

71
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,916
Don't hit me anymore.

72
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:17,875
No more cockroach.

73
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,291
You are right, it's gone.

74
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,875
It's still there.

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,916
Where?

76
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,000
Inside his hair, and it's still moving.

77
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:26,791
Oh yes, I see it now.

78
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,166
It's gone.

79
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,500
Girl, I've just saved you...

80
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,458
Not even a thank you.

81
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,583
Nevermind.

82
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,875
Take my sticker.

83
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,250
Take it, don't be scared.

84
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,125
Stick on your shoulder.

85
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,499
I give to the one whom I saved as a souvenior sometimes.

86
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,958
Remember, I'm Firefly.

87
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:53,875
I don't fly.

88
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:57,541
But I fly a little once in a while if the wind is strong.

89
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:01,541
Take all. You can stick yourself, goodbye.

90
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:10,208
Sadly, nowadays the youngsters are not appreciative...

91
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:38,166
So tired.

92
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,625
So tired right, dad?

93
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:41,999
How many times must I tell you?

94
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,374
Don't climb up like this.

95
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,916
Do you even know how old are you now?

96
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:48,916
Fifty only.

97
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:50,332
And then?

98
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,541
And then what?

99
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:54,624
You are not young anymore, so stop climbing up this way.

100
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,999
It's very dangerous ok?

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,417
You think I like to climb up this way and don't just use the door?

102
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:04,041
I'm worried other people may find out that I live here... I have lots of fans you know?

103
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:05,667
Then it'll be very troublesome.

104
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,832
You seriously doing this?

105
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:13,500
At first, I thought you only wanted to have some fun, so I designed this costume for you...

106
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:16,041
When are you going to stop all these superhero thing?

107
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:18,541
Have you forgotten how your mum died?

108
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:21,708
That's why I need...

109
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,500
to help people in need.

110
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:26,292
Mum is no longer here with us...

111
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,333
That's why I can't let anything happen to you...

112
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,166
Do not worry.

113
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:33,667
I can take care myself.

114
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,125
If you know how to take care of yourself then I would not have been worried for you everyday.

115
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:41,667
You spoilt brat, why you always bully daddy?

116
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:43,000
What bully?

117
00:08:44,042 --> 00:08:47,042
Can't you respect him as your dad?

118
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,000
Then have you respect me as your sister?

119
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:53,042
You both behave the same.

120
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,457
Always don't listen to my advice.

121
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,917
Are you going to take responsibility if anything happens to dad?

122
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,957
There are doctors and hospitals for such purpose.

123
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,917
Can you stop nagging dad for doing what he loves?

124
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,082
The doctor in hospital is needed to diagnose your narcissism sickness.

125
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:16,958
I'm not narcissistic, there is nothing wrong if I admire myself.

126
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,917
Look at yourself, you are so fat that you can be made into many Char Siew Pao!

127
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:25,458
Not cha siew pao... actually is big XL pao enough for all the people in the world.

128
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:30,542
Your thin bones can be used to make guitar.

129
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,792
Fatty you!

130
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,250
What are you trying to do?

131
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:04,041
I want to help out!

132
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:07,042
It's none of our business.

133
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:12,917
I left my wallet in the van, I go to take now.

134
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:14,875
You wait for me here.

135
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,332
Dear members of the media, good morning.

136
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:45,917
Today, I am going to make the official announcement...

137
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:51,958
Our A Corp power plant will start operations in two months time.

138
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:58,582
I have heard that there are a lot of complaints about the safety issue of our power plant.

139
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,125
But don't worry, our power plant is very safe.

140
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:10,208
I've consulted a professor from Gogoland University.

141
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:14,624
His report regarding the safety issue is very positive.

142
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,999
According to his report...

143
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,875
Our power plant is even safer than your risk crossing the road.

144
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:21,333
Any questions?

145
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:25,624
The pretty lady in yellow shirt...

146
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:29,042
Chou Tong, regarding the power plant causing serious polution to the environment...

147
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,125
And the possiblity of causing serious health issues to surrounding residents...

148
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,457
How do you explain to this issue...

149
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:38,208
We use latest technology...

150
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,707
Don't worry...

151
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:44,582
Actually I wanted to live nearby the power plant too if I got the chance.

152
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,082
You know why?

153
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:48,375
There's some kind of energy there...

154
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,667
Oh yes, it's positive energy!

155
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:55,457
The nearby residents...

156
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,749
They can come and hang around the plant...

157
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,916
Take photo, BBQ, and even picnic...

158
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:03,167
No problem with me...

159
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,500
Is there anymore questions?

160
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,250
Ah, no more questions... Good...

161
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:12,417
Goodbye.

162
00:13:15,792 --> 00:13:19,582
Four patients escaped from the asylum this afternoon.

163
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:21,542
The four patients are in poses a danger to themselves

164
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,749
and the people who may come across them.

165
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,125
Police urge the public to take precaution and to be alert of them.

166
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:33,457
Yes, the lady standing beside me is now safe and sound...

167
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,707
It's all because of Firefly

168
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:38,207
Miss, can you give us a description of Firefly?

169
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,583
Hope that you can help us to know more about Firefly.

170
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:44,166
Actually he is quite fat.

171
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:46,124
You mean he can fly?

172
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,957
Firefly really is an extraordinary person.

173
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:50,250
He has the ability to fly.

174
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:52,166
So did you have a good look at him?

175
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:54,374
Actually he is quite old.

176
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:58,791
You mean he is very mature and attractive.

177
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:02,167
Even young girls also can't resist Firefly's attractiveness.

178
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,416
Last question.

179
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:06,916
How did Firefly defeated the thugs?

180
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:09,166
It's all because he was lucky.

181
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:12,041
That's right, you are able to get Firefly's assistance...

182
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:14,124
Is all because of luck.

183
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,999
Ever since Firefly appears in our society...

184
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,750
We can all live peacefully.

185
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,166
Firefly, you are the best!

186
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:24,458
Live reporting from Fanny...

187
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,457
Big Miao, what are you doing?

188
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:31,125
Firefly news again! When are you going to stop all this nonsense?

189
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:33,999
Look at your big tummy.

190
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,124
Still want to act like a superhero? You think you are still 18?

191
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:41,958
I know I'm old, you don't have to remind me all the time.

192
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:47,667
If I don't remind you all the time, will you still remember?

193
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:51,166
Hey spoilt brat! He is your dad!

194
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:53,207
Can't you talk in a nicer way?

195
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,124
As if you are talking in a very nice way now.

196
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,750
I'm your big sister, where is your manners?

197
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,750
Aiyo, can you both stop the quarrel please!

198
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:05,624
Think of a solution instead.

199
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,583
You think yourself then.

200
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:11,917
Get a personal assistant will do.

201
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,582
Good idea.

202
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:18,542
Dad, I support you.

203
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:22,541
Ok, feel free to go and find, see who is dumb enough to do all these with you.

204
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:24,708
Dad, you have my full support.

205
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,957
Let's do this then.

206
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,333
You are both crazy!

207
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:42,333
This commercial is good.

208
00:15:44,542 --> 00:15:47,917
A lot of customers order this white coffee now in our shop.

209
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:57,250
The fat girl in the commercial looks like you.

210
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:04,333
Dad, I have your gene, I'm so pretty, while she's ugly!

211
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,625
The more I see, the more she looks like you.

212
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:13,625
Didn't I just say that she is ugly!

213
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:58,333
Three robbers was found dead at the backline Bangsar early this morning.

214
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:06,208
Please contact the local police station if you have any information.

215
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,791
Why so hot today?

216
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:26,292
What are you trying to do?

217
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,874
Mark Goh, you said hot.

218
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:33,792
Stupid, this is my style, quickly get someone to repair the air conditioner.

219
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,958
Hi, Mr Maihamdan, welcome.

220
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:10,292
How many times I've told you, my name is MA-HEN-DRAN.

221
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,083
OK... Maihamdan

222
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:15,417
Don't worry, I have a good news, my stocks are all class-A stock.

223
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:20,500
Remember to transfer money to my bank account in Switzerland.

224
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,167
Switzerland? You don't have local bank account?

225
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:28,458
Switzerland bank is international bank, it's very safe.

226
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:34,833
Remember, you can't afford to miss the deadline.

227
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:12,374
Mr Maihamdan, my line is good line, not dead-line

228
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,958
Alan, please send them off

229
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:29,167
When are you going to pay back the loan?

230
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:32,375
I don't have money. No money?

231
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,500
Give us your daughter if you don't have money to pay.

232
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:43,917
This bunch of bad thugs always bully innocent people.

233
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,792
You're welcome. I'm just doing what I should.

234
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,542
Thanks for your coconut.

235
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:10,833
I said thanks for your coconut.

236
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:15,250
I-can't-hear-you, come up please.

237
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,417
You are Firefly!

238
00:22:32,208 --> 00:22:33,708
I'm one of your fans!

239
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:40,916
Really? Good, then you join me.

240
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:43,082
Join you to do what?

241
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:46,624
You just follow what I do.

242
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:49,457
But we don't really know each other yet.

243
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,833
We'll get to know each other sooner or later.

244
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:56,042
Look, what is that?

245
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:12,792
Made it in time for this.

246
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:31,375
Who is it?

247
00:23:34,292 --> 00:23:35,874
How did you know that I stay here?

248
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:39,542
I followed you just now, but you don't even realize. This is dangerous!

249
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:42,374
Anyone follow you while you are following me?

250
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:43,458
Impossible.

251
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,167
Quickly come in.

252
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:54,583
Let's have a sit, this cartoon show is good.

253
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:57,625
Any drink?

254
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:01,832
Quickly tell me what drink you want.

255
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,541
Plain water will do.

256
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:05,375
Plain water also need to think so long.

257
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,250
How's the cartoon story so far?

258
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,374
Got ghost.

259
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,917
Ghost?

260
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,957
Cartoon also got ghost?

261
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:54,375
No, there - there - ghost

262
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,583
Oh, that's my daughter.

263
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:17,208
Why? My daughter is ugly is it?

264
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,332
They are my daughters.

265
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,292
Big Miao and Small Miao

266
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,417
Hi, Big Miao and Small Miao

267
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,166
Eh, I'm Small Miao, she's Big Miao.

268
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:34,042
Her size is like this last time, her size is like that last time.

269
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:35,458
Who is he.

270
00:25:37,208 --> 00:25:40,958
He is Han, my new personal assistant.

271
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,375
What personal assistant?

272
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:48,625
You promised me to let me find a personal assistant to protect me.

273
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:52,749
I also gave him a codename, Little Dragonfly.

274
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,082
Little Dragonfly, such a good name.

275
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:57,875
Suddenly I feel like I have a good mood.

276
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,875
I'll cook supper, you stay and eat ok?

277
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:04,167
You sure your food is safe to eat?

278
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,708
You eat trash all this time is it?

279
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,042
Actually I'm already full by looking at you.

280
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:11,499
Dad

281
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,000
No manners, stay back to eat, I want to watch TV first.

282
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:22,957
Hey spoilt brat move aside.

283
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:25,666
You are so fat.

284
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,749
They always quarrel.

285
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,125
The meat I cook is very tender.

286
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,917
Because I use my "love" to cook.

287
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:37,042
Actually I'm a vegetarian.

288
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:43,624
Never try never know, once you try, you never let go.

289
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:45,958
Eat more.

290
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:58,166
I have enough of you, you are so fat that tsunami can't splash you away.

291
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:01,499
At least I have tsunami...

292
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,124
You are so thin that the water in the drain is enough to splash you away.

293
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:05,917
I'm full already.

294
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:08,708
Come, I bring you to see my superhero vehicle.

295
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,042
It's all your fault.

296
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:27,333
It's so exciting to punish those criminals.

297
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,374
I feel that I'm so cool doing this...

298
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:33,458
What do you think?

299
00:27:40,917 --> 00:27:44,833
Boss, when are we going for our next mission?

300
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:48,833
Now.

301
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:47,167
This is our first mission together, don't fail me.

302
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:26,083
Help, got molester, rapist!

303
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:27,957
What are you talking about?

304
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:32,582
You both have been following me for a while, what a pervert rapist!

305
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:37,874
Come on, who want to molest you, we are here to protect you.

306
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:43,875
Protect me for what? Help! Got rapist!

307
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:57,707
It'll be great if we have a reliable informant.

308
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,082
What informant?

309
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:04,166
What do you think of Fanny?

310
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:07,166
The reporter in the TV? Not bad.

311
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:11,332
Let's take photo together, I'm sure a lot of our fans will 'like' us.

312
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:14,333
Comeďź1, 2, 3.

313
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,875
Why are you following me?

314
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:39,082
Actually both of us need you.

315
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,500
Pervert!

316
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:43,333
You too, pervert!

317
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:47,749
What so funny? Funny

318
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,999
Uncle, my name is Fanny, not Funny, do you watch TV?

319
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,666
Yes, I do.

320
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:53,707
So why follow me?

321
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:59,083
Actually we need you to become our informant.

322
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:00,333
Informant?

323
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:03,791
I tell you a secret, you don't panic.

324
00:31:03,792 --> 00:31:06,292
I'm Firefly.

325
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,375
Why!

326
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:22,250
How can you be Firefly?

327
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:28,667
Go over to console her, or hug her maybe, go...

328
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,167
What are you doing?

329
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,292
There is an aedes mosquito.

330
00:31:43,293 --> 00:31:45,625
Yes got mosquito.

331
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:50,333
Ok, I'll help you because you are Firefly.

332
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:57,000
Although you are not as macho as I thought.

333
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,791
It doesn't mean only macho people can be Firefly.

334
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:07,416
Stop talking nonsense.

335
00:32:07,417 --> 00:32:13,417
I know that Mark Goh will have an illegal transaction at Shah Alam Industry area tonight.

336
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:20,417
You meant the Mark Goh, who is one of the most powerful crime lord in KL?

337
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:26,166
Then let's go get prepared now.

338
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:28,542
Aiya, it's still very early.

339
00:32:29,042 --> 00:32:33,332
Not early at all. I need at least three hours to wear my costume.

340
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:38,749
And it takes another few hours for my super motorbike to reach the destination.

341
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,583
Am I right?

342
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:44,708
Then what are we waiting for, let's go.

343
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:50,792
Wipe your eyes ok?

344
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,041
Alan, how is our stock?

345
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:06,958
Very good, all class-A stock.

346
00:33:16,417 --> 00:33:18,292
Class-F, F U lah!

347
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,125
Complain to the supplier.

348
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:22,750
Ok, I call him now.

349
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:34,125
See how many people are there.

350
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:37,333
How many?

351
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:38,708
Four.

352
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:39,583
Four?

353
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:40,583
Let's go then.

354
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:51,208
So many people you said four only?

355
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:53,833
You fight them first, go.

356
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,375
You, go.

357
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:11,542
Boss, are you alright?

358
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,875
Hit them.

359
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,042
Kick him.

360
00:35:09,708 --> 00:35:10,375
One punch to him.

361
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,417
Did you see a fat and short man walk pass here?

362
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:53,083
I saw him went to that side.

363
00:36:14,042 --> 00:36:16,542
Why are you so slow?

364
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:18,667
It's already very fast.

365
00:36:19,292 --> 00:36:21,500
I settled 3 person just now.

366
00:36:22,542 --> 00:36:26,667
Tie them all up, and call the police.

367
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:28,000
Hold on.

368
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:29,917
Help me to stick my sticker.

369
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:32,875
Each person one sticker.

370
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,333
Seems like one person is missing from here...

371
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:48,917
Class-F, F-F-F...

372
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:03,000
A massacre happened in Shah Alam industrial area an hour ago.

373
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:06,999
It is believed to be done by a man called Black Hornet.

374
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,833
And the man behind me is the only survivor of the massacre.

375
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:12,375
Four of them suddenly appear from nowhere...

376
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,542
one of them calls himself Black Hornet.

377
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:16,750
What happened then?

378
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,708
They killed all our men.

379
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:24,667
He wants justice to prevail and to kill everyone involved in crime.

380
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:27,292
They are not human, they are demon.

381
00:37:28,375 --> 00:37:29,874
Who is this Black Hornet?

382
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:32,958
Is he doing the right thing?

383
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,749
And who will be the next victim?

384
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,291
Stay tune with us for more news on Black Hornet.

385
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:39,875
Reporting from Fanny.

386
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:41,750
All my brothers,

387
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,042
you guys died horribly.

388
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:49,542
I want to take revenge! Alan,

389
00:37:52,292 --> 00:37:54,333
Go catch the green short man.

390
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,749
No, our men are killed by the Black Hornet.

391
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,250
I don't care, they are the same gang.

392
00:38:00,167 --> 00:38:01,375
Faster go, stupid.

393
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:03,375
Only myself?

394
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:07,000
Try to find some new men, stupid.

395
00:38:07,625 --> 00:38:08,417
How to find?

396
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:09,083
You come over

397
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:11,500
Think yourself.

398
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:13,292
Ok, I go now.

399
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:18,500
All my brothers.

400
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,083
Come, follow me.

401
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:35,583
I furnish you with pretty clothes, including a place to stay.

402
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,167
I provide you with good food too.

403
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:42,167
Why are you trying to run away?

404
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,208
I want to go home.

405
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:55,583
Now, you scratch your own face with this.

406
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:58,582
So you won't be able to get business for us any longer.

407
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:01,375
Then you may go home and it's easier for me to explain to the boss.

408
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:09,333
Who are you guys?

409
00:39:23,458 --> 00:39:25,042
Miss, you may go home now.

410
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:41,249
Don't kill me.

411
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,832
I'll give you anything you want.

412
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:45,207
Really? You'll give me anything I want?

413
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:46,792
Yes, anything.

414
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,832
I want your life.

415
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:51,416
What you want my life for?

416
00:39:51,417 --> 00:39:54,000
I only work for others.

417
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,417
Work for others?

418
00:39:58,625 --> 00:40:00,207
So who is your boss then?

419
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:02,458
My boss is not here.

420
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:08,042
Where can I find him?

421
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,208
I can tell you,

422
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:12,708
But you promise me, don't kill me ok.

423
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,291
Don't kill you...

424
00:40:16,292 --> 00:40:16,958
Ok.

425
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:18,708
I promise.

426
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:25,792
Don't tell him that I'm the one who give you this.

427
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,083
Thanks for your cooperation.

428
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:33,792
You've promised that you won't kill me.

429
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:40,916
Noname.

430
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:42,500
You do it.

431
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:13,124
Darling...

432
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:14,667
Firefly hairpin?

433
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,500
Remember... I'm your Firefly.

434
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,417
Who turned off my music?

435
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,167
Dad, why are you still listening to old fashion song like this?

436
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,208
You know this song right...

437
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:34,042
Your mum and I love this song very much.

438
00:41:35,083 --> 00:41:39,916
That's right, you've interrupted my mood too.

439
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:41,833
Go on dreaming.

440
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,833
How about you?

441
00:41:46,417 --> 00:41:49,208
I have emotion unlike you.

442
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:52,125
I don't want to talk to someone like you.

443
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:55,000
Spoilt brat, looking for a fight is it?

444
00:41:55,417 --> 00:41:57,874
You come back here!

445
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:59,167
You come out now.

446
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:04,708
Han, come over here.

447
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:07,042
You hold on.

448
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:08,625
You can talk now.

449
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,832
You guys saw Black Hornet news?

450
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,916
He has killed many people.

451
00:42:12,917 --> 00:42:14,499
You have to think of a way to stop him.

452
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,958
Remember ok? Bye.

453
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:20,375
What should we do now?

454
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:25,708
We have to create a scenario, to get him out.

455
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:30,167
How now

456
00:42:32,042 --> 00:42:35,708
I have a good figure, whatever posing I do is nicer than yours.

457
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:38,916
Look at your figure...

458
00:42:38,917 --> 00:42:42,333
Aeroplane land also will crash for sure.

459
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:45,749
Oh, your airport is even worse.

460
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,750
Aeroplane also don't know want to land at the front or at the back.

461
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:52,208
You - you - you - you

462
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,458
What are you looking at?

463
00:42:56,458 --> 00:42:59,333
Eh, I'm your dad, why can't I look at you two quarelling?

464
00:43:00,292 --> 00:43:03,458
We are trying to think of a good idea... You guys only know how to quarrel.

465
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:12,583
We act out a crime scene, to lure Black Hornet out.

466
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,541
You be the hero, and you be come the heroine.

467
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:17,250
Me? I'm not interested.

468
00:43:19,583 --> 00:43:21,667
Dad, I sacrifice myself, I'll be the heroine.

469
00:43:24,042 --> 00:43:26,125
Ok then, seems like you are the only the option.

470
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:29,542
You molest her at the beginning of the scene.

471
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,333
What, I molest her? Or she molest me?

472
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:34,458
Dad

473
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:36,708
Just do as I say.

474
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:42,500
Brother Titus.

475
00:43:42,583 --> 00:43:43,707
Who are you?

476
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:44,917
I'm...

477
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:54,917
Serve you well!

478
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:02,500
Help me!

479
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,458
Titus, where do you want to go?

480
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:19,417
I've been searching for you for quite some time.

481
00:44:27,542 --> 00:44:30,667
Let's enjoy the fresh air.

482
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:46,708
Oh my god, it's disgusting...

483
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:52,292
It's a humiliation to KL, let's leave fast!

484
00:45:55,792 --> 00:45:57,375
Are you ready?

485
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:04,167
My hero.

486
00:46:10,292 --> 00:46:13,750
Why you keep on vomiting? Let's get ready.

487
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:21,875
No... Don't come near me!

488
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,166
I'm not married yet...

489
00:46:24,167 --> 00:46:25,125
This is my first time too.

490
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:29,333
Don't chase me!

491
00:46:30,208 --> 00:46:32,583
It's end of the road!

492
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,250
No, no

493
00:46:38,542 --> 00:46:39,333
Go!

494
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,333
Can this even lure Black Hornet out??

495
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,291
Don't...

496
00:46:43,292 --> 00:46:44,167
Let's do this quick!

497
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:48,416
We have to be more serious.

498
00:46:48,417 --> 00:46:49,999
If not, he won't come

499
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,917
Wait!

500
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:52,708
What are you waiting for?

501
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:00,458
Can you be more serious!

502
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:06,667
Please be serious!

503
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:15,375
Enough.

504
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:19,167
Dad, we need more time, or else he won't come.

505
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:25,250
I said enough.

506
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:33,374
We have yet to kiss!

507
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,957
Kiss your head!

508
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:36,417
Go home.

509
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,500
Are you alright?

510
00:47:43,792 --> 00:47:46,292
Wait for me, it's so funny.

511
00:47:47,167 --> 00:47:50,333
This is my daughter's first acting, quite good too.

512
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:55,542
I find you a prettier and hotter girl next time ok?

513
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,917
Seems like Black Hornet did not fall for our trick.

514
00:48:01,792 --> 00:48:04,250
Let's not wait any longer.

515
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:06,792
Aren't you looking for me?

516
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:10,250
So you're Black Hornet.

517
00:48:11,042 --> 00:48:12,042
I am...

518
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:14,167
He is not worth the title.

519
00:48:14,168 --> 00:48:15,750
Then you are?

520
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,375
So who is the real Black Hornet?

521
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:26,042
So you are Black Hornet.

522
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:30,250
Why are you killing innocent people?

523
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:32,792
Innocent?

524
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:36,042
You are telling me these kind of people are innocent?

525
00:48:37,458 --> 00:48:39,707
What kind of hero are you.

526
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,249
I'm a hero that likes to help people.

527
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,832
I help good people all the time.

528
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:46,292
But you are different, you kill people.

529
00:48:46,375 --> 00:48:48,625
The people I kill are all criminals.

530
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:51,666
They don't deserve to live in this world.

531
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:53,666
You should thank me instead.

532
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:57,249
I-Firefly, will teach you a lesson tonight.

533
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,833
Dragonfly, you go.

534
00:49:00,042 --> 00:49:01,833
What a dumb move.

535
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:04,042
Noname.

536
00:49:06,792 --> 00:49:10,583
Let me handle him.

537
00:49:10,667 --> 00:49:12,749
This sissy...

538
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,333
Sissy also have to hit.

539
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,542
Boss.

540
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,000
Don't waste any time, Noname.

541
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:25,125
Go.

542
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:39,250
Go go!

543
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,917
Hit him.

544
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:22,667
Are you ok?

545
00:50:23,083 --> 00:50:26,124
Firefly? Your capability is just like a bug.

546
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:28,917
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, it's normal!

547
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:32,500
How? Let's come for a rematch tomorrow if you dare.

548
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:36,292
Let's go home.

549
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:39,791
Why? You want me to carry you back is it?

550
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:41,917
Walk yourself!

551
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:05,208
Firefly, can you say something to the audiences?

552
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:10,332
Sure!

553
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:14,458
I like to help people in need.

554
00:51:16,167 --> 00:51:19,125
When I am free, I will go and donate blood...

555
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:22,708
I'll also go to old folks home and orphanage.

556
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:26,125
I also love to lead old people cross the road.

557
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,500
Firefly, can you repeat what you said in English?

558
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:32,000
Yes, of course.

559
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,292
I like to save people.

560
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:38,708
I like to help people.

561
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:43,542
Sometimes, if I'm free, I'll donate blood

562
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:48,750
I like to visit orphanage and old folks home.

563
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:53,916
I also like to carry beautiful lady cross the road.

564
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:57,666
Firefly, do you think your action causes any danger...

565
00:51:57,667 --> 00:51:59,374
And may be against the law?

566
00:51:59,375 --> 00:52:01,749
Prawn(udang)? I like prawn the most

567
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:04,708
Prawn is nutritious and delicious, I like.

568
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:10,666
Chou Tong, what is your opinion on Firefly and Black Hornet?

569
00:52:10,667 --> 00:52:14,499
This two group of people? They like to dress horribly.

570
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,416
Try to scare ghost?

571
00:52:16,417 --> 00:52:20,666
But the crime rate has decrease since their appearance.

572
00:52:20,667 --> 00:52:21,667
What do you think?

573
00:52:21,668 --> 00:52:23,541
Let me tell you.

574
00:52:23,542 --> 00:52:27,166
Kuala Lumpur is a very safe country.

575
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:31,166
Sorry, not country, it's place.

576
00:52:31,167 --> 00:52:33,457
This two group of people are trying to mess things up here.

577
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:35,374
Trying to be superhero?

578
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:36,791
If they want to help the society...

579
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:39,916
They can learn from me.

580
00:52:39,917 --> 00:52:41,707
Just a week ago...

581
00:52:41,708 --> 00:52:46,875
I established five orphanage home...

582
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:51,625
And I also established seventeen oldfolks home.

583
00:52:52,542 --> 00:52:55,041
Just learn from me if they want to help the society.

584
00:52:55,042 --> 00:52:57,582
Still want to dress up like a superhero? They think they are still kids?

585
00:52:57,583 --> 00:52:59,249
Chou Tong, can we take a photo of you?

586
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,917
Sure.

587
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:30,208
Having supper in your own shop? I thought we are going somewhere else.

588
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:32,666
It's the same, it's supper too.

589
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:36,374
The food here is tasty and free of charge.

590
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:39,333
It's expensive if you eat elsewhere.

591
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,458
I obtained some information about Black Hornet.

592
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:48,874
Black Hornet's real name is Cheah Ling Feng.

593
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:51,999
He was a scientist.

594
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,666
But three years ago...

595
00:53:53,667 --> 00:53:57,666
He went mad and killed his own wife and son.

596
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:00,624
And burned down his own house.

597
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:03,583
He was then locked in the high risk mental asylum.

598
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,875
Really?

599
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:11,916
No wonder he looks a bit crazy to me.

600
00:54:11,917 --> 00:54:14,874
Wait a minute.

601
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:17,832
Let me snap photo and upload on facebook.

602
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:21,250
We need to share good food information with others.

603
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:25,333
Can I eat now? Yes.

604
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,916
Firefly just uploaded some new photos on his fanpage.

605
00:54:29,917 --> 00:54:32,249
What photo? You have a look yourself.

606
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:34,500
It looks very familiar.

607
00:54:41,167 --> 00:54:43,582
Quickly give a call to our boss.

608
00:54:43,583 --> 00:54:45,417
Boss, we've found him.

609
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:58,916
Delicious? Yes...

610
00:54:58,917 --> 00:55:00,499
I got to go now.

611
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,041
Han, send Funny back.

612
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:04,208
Let's go.

613
00:55:22,083 --> 00:55:25,042
Big Miao, it's not safe to be out late at night.

614
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:28,666
I'm Firefly's daughter...

615
00:55:28,667 --> 00:55:30,500
I can take care of myself.

616
00:55:32,208 --> 00:55:34,708
So you are Firefly.

617
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,957
I'm not Firefly.

618
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:42,250
I also didn't want to believe, but your own fanpage post is the one that revealed your identity.

619
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:45,750
Mark Goh wants to invite you for supper.

620
00:55:46,875 --> 00:55:49,624
You tell him I've just eaten.

621
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:50,957
Just eaten!?

622
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:51,667
Go!

623
00:55:51,668 --> 00:55:53,042
Chase after them!

624
00:55:55,583 --> 00:55:56,667
Let me go.

625
00:55:57,542 --> 00:55:58,625
Let me go.

626
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:04,833
What is all this noise at this hour!? People need to sleep ok!

627
00:56:09,167 --> 00:56:10,833
Grab the fat one too.

628
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:14,417
Don't touch me.

629
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:21,208
Big Miao once said tsunami also won't be able to splash me away.

630
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:22,625
It's true!

631
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:24,792
So troublesome.

632
00:56:25,292 --> 00:56:27,292
I think she can't even fit into our car. Forget about her then.

633
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:29,000
Let my daughter go!

634
00:56:33,292 --> 00:56:36,542
Daddy... Big Miao

635
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:41,750
Little Dragonfly!

636
00:56:46,333 --> 00:56:49,792
Why did you invite me here for supper?

637
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:53,333
Supper? Dream on.

638
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:56,667
Where is my daughter?

639
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,416
What miao?

640
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,249
Are you looking for cat?

641
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,167
Why don't you look after yourself first.

642
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:07,083
Can't believe that the famous Firefly...

643
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:09,333
is actually an old uncle.

644
00:57:15,167 --> 00:57:17,208
What's wrong with an old uncle being a hero?

645
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:22,333
If you dare to touch my daughter, even just a piece of her hair strand...

646
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:25,458
See what I'll do to you...

647
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,375
What? What can you do!?

648
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:30,207
Try to hit me again if you dare...

649
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:31,749
So what if I hit you again?

650
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,124
Try one more time if you dare!

651
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:34,792
I hit you some more, so what?

652
00:57:36,417 --> 00:57:38,292
Why you bring me here?

653
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:40,082
I ask you

654
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:42,083
Why did you do that?

655
00:57:43,083 --> 00:57:44,666
You asked me, what did I do?

656
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:46,666
I ask you why did you do that

657
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:48,666
What did I do?

658
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:50,666
I asked you why did you do that!

659
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:53,042
What exactly did I do!!??

660
00:57:54,042 --> 00:57:55,291
I didn't do anything!

661
00:57:55,292 --> 00:57:56,832
You kidnap me here for what?

662
00:57:56,833 --> 00:57:58,291
You don't understand mandarin is it?

663
00:57:58,292 --> 00:57:59,958
Then I speak to you in English.

664
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:02,333
I ask... you why did you do that?

665
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:07,083
What... I don't know what are you talking about?

666
00:58:08,083 --> 00:58:10,083
You don't act stupid.

667
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,291
I will let you know...

668
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:14,125
What?

669
00:58:14,126 --> 00:58:16,708
You will take responsibility for what you have done.

670
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:22,000
What the... I really don't know what you are talking about!

671
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:24,624
Don't understand?

672
00:58:24,625 --> 00:58:26,125
Your handphone is ringing.

673
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Mr Hamdan.

674
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:38,167
Phone signal here is not that good.

675
00:58:38,667 --> 00:58:39,833
Whack you.

676
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:48,792
According to my informant...

677
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:51,083
This is the place.

678
00:58:52,042 --> 00:58:54,874
What informant? Only the police have informants...

679
00:58:54,875 --> 00:58:57,207
Reporters don't have, don't simply say...

680
00:58:57,208 --> 00:58:58,957
I have my own fans ok.

681
00:58:58,958 --> 00:59:00,958
Please be serious, let's go in.

682
00:59:09,417 --> 00:59:12,042
This place is huge, how are we going to locate them?

683
00:59:12,792 --> 00:59:14,582
Follow the voice...

684
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:15,500
How?

685
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:18,083
Please stop talking and listen carefully.

686
00:59:18,417 --> 00:59:19,917
Big Miao

687
00:59:21,333 --> 00:59:23,333
Big Miao, where are you?

688
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,999
Small Miao, you guys are here.

689
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,374
Release me.

690
00:59:32,375 --> 00:59:34,375
It's locked.

691
00:59:36,542 --> 00:59:37,667
Let me hit this.

692
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,125
Don't simply hit.

693
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:43,292
Leave me here, go find Big Miao first.

694
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:45,999
Quick.

695
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,583
We go there first

696
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:51,167
Let's try that side.

697
00:59:54,375 --> 00:59:55,750
You both go first.

698
00:59:56,417 --> 00:59:57,583
Be careful.

699
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:08,625
Big Miao...

700
01:00:09,583 --> 01:00:10,833
Should call this name instead

701
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:14,000
Spoilt brat...

702
01:00:20,542 --> 01:00:21,875
Quickly untie me.

703
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:29,625
Go go go

704
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,332
You guys are back.

705
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:41,749
Big Miao, are you alright?

706
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:42,583
I'm ok.

707
01:00:42,584 --> 01:00:43,666
It's good to hear that.

708
01:00:43,667 --> 01:00:44,916
Quickly help dad.

709
01:00:44,917 --> 01:00:46,083
We can't open this without the key.

710
01:00:47,542 --> 01:00:48,667
Quickly think of a solution.

711
01:00:50,042 --> 01:00:51,417
Let's try look for the key.

712
01:01:03,042 --> 01:01:04,792
Mark Goh, how?

713
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:07,791
That side only 1 person, very easy.

714
01:01:07,792 --> 01:01:10,708
All of you go to that side and settle him.

715
01:01:14,292 --> 01:01:15,624
I recognise you.

716
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:17,957
You are the reporter in TV.

717
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:20,082
Why do you stand beside the killer?

718
01:01:20,083 --> 01:01:22,833
He is not a killer, he's our dad.

719
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:24,167
Yes, dad.

720
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:29,041
He is not a killer.

721
01:01:29,042 --> 01:01:31,542
He is the hero, Firefly.

722
01:01:34,208 --> 01:01:36,624
He did not kill your men.

723
01:01:36,625 --> 01:01:38,208
He's not the killer?

724
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:42,332
Then all me men died automatically?

725
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:43,208
Maybe.

726
01:01:46,292 --> 01:01:48,624
It could be that you didn't provide meal to your men

727
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:49,708
that's why they died.

728
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,375
I don't care.

729
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,916
I want to seek vengeance for my men tonight.

730
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:56,667
How? He wants to seek vengeance.

731
01:01:59,958 --> 01:02:01,125
Small Miao

732
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:03,167
Did you see that?

733
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:05,708
There

734
01:02:07,208 --> 01:02:08,208
It's huge.

735
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:11,208
Look!

736
01:02:16,667 --> 01:02:17,875
Quick.

737
01:02:20,625 --> 01:02:21,833
Quick

738
01:02:47,542 --> 01:02:49,708
Want to take my key, dream on.

739
01:02:53,792 --> 01:02:55,000
My coat.

740
01:02:56,083 --> 01:02:57,667
You can take my key...

741
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,958
But not my coat.

742
01:03:00,792 --> 01:03:03,542
We will exchange the key with your coat.

743
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,207
The key.

744
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:15,417
Take it.

745
01:03:19,917 --> 01:03:22,417
Found the key!

746
01:03:25,458 --> 01:03:27,375
Let's go, Little Dragonfly.

747
01:03:34,333 --> 01:03:36,374
Although we are not born on the same year, same month and same day

748
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:38,833
But we can die together on the same date.

749
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:40,917
Why are you saying all this? Let's go

750
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,292
You guys go first.

751
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,458
Mark Goh, are you alright?

752
01:04:06,333 --> 01:04:07,542
You people!

753
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:08,917
There's a emergency case here!

754
01:04:09,167 --> 01:04:10,374
Where did you all go?

755
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:11,582
We went out for supper.

756
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:12,791
Eat your head!

757
01:04:12,792 --> 01:04:14,458
Do you know that I almost die?

758
01:04:14,667 --> 01:04:16,917
The fatty cat sat on me just now.

759
01:04:17,333 --> 01:04:19,125
Ok, let's go then.

760
01:04:19,667 --> 01:04:20,583
Go where?

761
01:04:20,584 --> 01:04:22,667
Go clinic, you said you almost died right.

762
01:04:26,417 --> 01:04:28,167
You stupid son of monkey.

763
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:31,333
Usually hero dies first you know.

764
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:32,875
Tonight

765
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:37,125
I want you to die in KL!

766
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:39,750
All my men, go!

767
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,708
What happen?

768
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:44,958
Didn't pay electricity bill again?

769
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,291
What happen?

770
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:49,500
Alan

771
01:04:57,292 --> 01:04:58,333
Dead?

772
01:05:10,417 --> 01:05:11,624
Who are you?

773
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:12,833
What are you doing?

774
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,749
Kiddo, no need to thank me.

775
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,708
I'll handle him for you.

776
01:05:18,125 --> 01:05:19,000
Let's go.

777
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:20,208
Help me.

778
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,249
Why are you standing there?

779
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:24,957
Hero is suppose to save people you know?

780
01:05:24,958 --> 01:05:26,417
What type of hero are you!?

781
01:05:38,917 --> 01:05:40,125
Boss, it's painful.

782
01:07:41,667 --> 01:07:42,625
Enough!

783
01:08:05,042 --> 01:08:06,874
Those gangster don't even know the proper way to tie people...

784
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:09,125
My whole body is in pain now!

785
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:13,874
He asked us to leave first just now...

786
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:16,167
And till now he is not back yet...

787
01:08:16,667 --> 01:08:18,957
Dad, will I become a widow?

788
01:08:18,958 --> 01:08:20,957
What nonsense are you talking about?

789
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:23,541
I'm in pain now and you don't even bother...

790
01:08:23,542 --> 01:08:25,167
Only worry bout him...

791
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,167
But you are already in a safe place now...

792
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:38,042
Dad, here is Ah Huat White Coffee...

793
01:08:40,625 --> 01:08:41,625
Thank you.

794
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,250
Still in pain?

795
01:08:52,167 --> 01:08:53,375
Strange, the pain has disappeared.

796
01:08:55,625 --> 01:08:57,833
This white coffee is really cool.

797
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,208
Hubby.

798
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:04,500
Hubby?

799
01:09:14,667 --> 01:09:17,167
Mark Goh has been captured by Black Hornet.

800
01:09:20,792 --> 01:09:22,000
Wake up.

801
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,333
Wake up now.

802
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:28,250
Where am I?

803
01:09:29,792 --> 01:09:31,792
Who are you, why you take me here?

804
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:34,750
You release me, I give you money.

805
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,625
Speak in Chinese!

806
01:09:40,958 --> 01:09:42,958
You meant my English is not good is it?

807
01:09:43,917 --> 01:09:47,332
Do you know that I studied my English in British?

808
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:48,542
England!?

809
01:09:48,792 --> 01:09:50,000
British!?

810
01:09:50,667 --> 01:09:51,875
Idiot!

811
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,792
You are finished this time.

812
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:05,957
Boss, this uncle is so childish.

813
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:07,500
Why you take me here?

814
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:10,375
I don't know you.

815
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:13,750
Are you sure?

816
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:15,958
I'm sure.

817
01:10:16,292 --> 01:10:17,833
You must have mistaken me for someone else.

818
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:19,583
Let me go.

819
01:10:22,292 --> 01:10:24,125
Let me remind you then.

820
01:10:24,792 --> 01:10:26,500
The incident that happens between us...

821
01:10:27,708 --> 01:10:30,417
It happened on Christmas eve.

822
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:33,707
I'm so sorry.

823
01:11:33,708 --> 01:11:35,957
On the 1st and 15th of each month...

824
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:40,041
I will go to the temple to pray for your wife and son.

825
01:11:40,042 --> 01:11:42,832
I promise you, from today onwards...

826
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:44,625
I'll become vegetarian.

827
01:11:45,792 --> 01:11:47,000
Pardon me.

828
01:11:48,542 --> 01:11:50,667
Please don't kill me.

829
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:58,625
Why are you crying?

830
01:11:59,292 --> 01:12:01,708
I won't kill you...

831
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:05,500
not now

832
01:12:09,917 --> 01:12:12,791
Call your good friend now.

833
01:12:12,792 --> 01:12:15,082
Invite his whole family...

834
01:12:15,083 --> 01:12:17,417
To attend your Christmas party.

835
01:12:20,542 --> 01:12:23,250
If they don't want to come, how?

836
01:12:24,625 --> 01:12:26,958
Then it's meaningless for me to keep you alive right?

837
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:33,792
Chou Tong

838
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:36,207
I am organising a Chritsmas party.

839
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:37,582
Will you attend?

840
01:12:37,583 --> 01:12:40,125
Christmas party? Wait a minute...

841
01:12:42,625 --> 01:12:44,792
I thought it's snowing in KL now.

842
01:12:45,167 --> 01:12:46,374
You are so stingy

843
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:49,167
And now you want to organize party? Are you ok?

844
01:12:50,792 --> 01:12:52,958
We have to celebrate and relax sometimes.

845
01:12:54,542 --> 01:12:57,750
I'm sorry, I'm not free, please don't disturb me.

846
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:03,042
I've arranged a special prize for you from lucky draw.

847
01:13:04,208 --> 01:13:07,958
There's lucky draw too, you've changed a lot

848
01:13:09,708 --> 01:13:10,917
It's a big prize

849
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:12,750
You'll be surprised.

850
01:13:13,875 --> 01:13:18,167
Do come with your whole family too!

851
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:24,875
Please reserve three seats for me then.

852
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,667
Let me know the venue and exact time soon.

853
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:31,792
Talk to you later... goodbye.

854
01:14:15,708 --> 01:14:18,374
Funny, you saw the news?

855
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:21,207
A lot of reporters disappeared in one night.

856
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:22,999
Do you know who did this?

857
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,875
I don't know, the police are still investigating.

858
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:28,707
You have to be alert too.

859
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:30,208
Ok, I will.

860
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:40,667
Welcome.

861
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:43,500
Everyone get closer.

862
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,999
Why you kidnap all of us here?

863
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,208
The reason we invite you...

864
01:14:48,708 --> 01:14:52,458
Is to witness an important scandalous news.

865
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:56,041
Please make sure it's a valuable news.

866
01:14:56,042 --> 01:14:58,792
Our time is very valuable.

867
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:01,083
Yes

868
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:05,583
Silent

869
01:15:06,042 --> 01:15:08,875
Take out your mobile phone.

870
01:15:09,667 --> 01:15:12,250
Put into this bag.

871
01:15:15,292 --> 01:15:16,833
What if we don't want to?

872
01:15:27,042 --> 01:15:28,250
Thank you.

873
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:47,083
Dad, your mobile phone is ringing.

874
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:51,375
Don't simply put your mobile phone.

875
01:15:55,792 --> 01:15:57,374
Funny, where are you?

876
01:15:57,375 --> 01:15:58,583
We are at...

877
01:16:02,917 --> 01:16:04,125
Uncle

878
01:16:04,708 --> 01:16:06,500
We're at Lala Paradise.

879
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:09,707
We are the good guys.

880
01:16:09,708 --> 01:16:12,792
We invited your daughter here to cover news only.

881
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,083
Why did you reveal our location to him?

882
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,624
Where got!

883
01:16:21,625 --> 01:16:22,708
Let's go.

884
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:24,083
Where are you going?

885
01:16:24,667 --> 01:16:27,250
Both of you don't come along, it's dangerous.

886
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:30,125
You don't come along, it's dangerous.

887
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:31,667
You don't...

888
01:16:38,542 --> 01:16:39,749
What are you doing?

889
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:43,042
Just a dinner, please don't over react.

890
01:16:43,542 --> 01:16:44,750
Wait outside.

891
01:16:50,167 --> 01:16:51,375
Mark Goh, Merry Christmas.

892
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:57,916
You are still wearing the same coat after all this years.

893
01:16:57,917 --> 01:16:59,125
Don't you feel hot?

894
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:01,708
This is my style.

895
01:17:04,792 --> 01:17:06,292
Only four of us?

896
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:09,917
Of course not, this is VIP room.

897
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:12,708
Only for you... Very Important People.

898
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:15,208
Others are at different room.

899
01:17:20,083 --> 01:17:21,708
What's the video camera for?

900
01:17:22,417 --> 01:17:24,916
I want to make event video for tonight.

901
01:17:24,917 --> 01:17:27,957
Event video? You are stingy as always

902
01:17:27,958 --> 01:17:30,625
Don't even want to hire a photographer

903
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:33,333
The economy is not doing well

904
01:17:34,417 --> 01:17:36,333
Daddy, I want to go to toilet

905
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:39,417
Ok, mummy bring you there

906
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:48,167
This is the place

907
01:17:48,833 --> 01:17:50,082
What plan we have?

908
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:51,292
What plan

909
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,082
I ask you come along is to help me

910
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:55,999
After I go in later

911
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,082
I'll blow whistle if anything happen

912
01:17:58,083 --> 01:17:59,875
Then you'll need to come in to help me, ok

913
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:06,458
What is this dish

914
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:08,792
It's turkey

915
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:11,957
Turkey? It doesn't look like it?

916
01:18:11,958 --> 01:18:13,167
It's so tiny

917
01:18:13,708 --> 01:18:16,042
It's import from Africa

918
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:18,333
It's Africa turkey

919
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:21,792
It's true, there's not much food in Africa usually

920
01:18:22,792 --> 01:18:24,667
Enjoy your dinner

921
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:27,125
Who is this, he looks ugly

922
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:29,666
He is part time waitor, out of budget

923
01:18:29,667 --> 01:18:32,125
I lost my appetite already

924
01:18:32,792 --> 01:18:34,000
Go away

925
01:18:35,917 --> 01:18:37,625
He is more ugly than this turkey

926
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:45,583
What is happening

927
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:55,124
Who are you?

928
01:18:55,125 --> 01:18:56,333
Chou Tong

929
01:18:57,292 --> 01:19:00,374
You don't recognise me after all these years...

930
01:19:00,375 --> 01:19:01,832
it's normal

931
01:19:01,833 --> 01:19:03,666
When we first met

932
01:19:03,667 --> 01:19:05,625
is at my science laboratory

933
01:19:08,792 --> 01:19:10,333
Darling, I just recall

934
01:19:10,625 --> 01:19:12,332
You forgot to turn off the gas

935
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:13,542
Let's go home

936
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:15,583
Sit down...

937
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:19,292
Why are you in such a hurry

938
01:19:20,458 --> 01:19:25,167
Today is Christmas, we should gather and chit chat a bit

939
01:19:26,417 --> 01:19:27,375
Kid

940
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:29,582
What is your name?

941
01:19:29,583 --> 01:19:30,792
I'm Lun Lun

942
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:33,167
Lun Lun

943
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:36,833
Chou Tong

944
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:39,458
Please tell Lun Lun

945
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:42,583
How we knew each other

946
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:50,333
What are you talking about?

947
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:53,749
I've told you not to come along

948
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:56,292
I never listen to you all this while

949
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:02,291
Dad went in from the front door

950
01:20:02,292 --> 01:20:04,083
We go in through the back door

951
01:20:04,417 --> 01:20:05,499
Go go go

952
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,708
I go now, you go home

953
01:20:13,792 --> 01:20:17,125
This uncle is a professor

954
01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:21,957
He used to help daddy

955
01:20:21,958 --> 01:20:25,875
Worked in power plant as researcher

956
01:20:26,875 --> 01:20:28,083
And then

957
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:30,667
And

958
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:34,666
There is a slight misunderstanding between us

959
01:20:34,667 --> 01:20:36,250
A very small matter

960
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:38,292
Misunderstanding?

961
01:20:40,917 --> 01:20:42,374
You blame on him

962
01:20:42,375 --> 01:20:43,749
He is the one who did all this

963
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:45,249
I follow your instruction

964
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:46,833
You don't blame everything on me

965
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:49,542
I ask you eat shit, why don't you eat then

966
01:20:49,958 --> 01:20:51,625
You are the master mind

967
01:20:52,708 --> 01:20:54,207
I work for you only

968
01:20:54,208 --> 01:20:56,542
I ask you to go die now, will you

969
01:20:56,667 --> 01:20:57,750
It's enough!

970
01:21:11,667 --> 01:21:16,124
You both want to save lives

971
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:19,374
Pass through me first then

972
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:20,999
I can handle all by myself

973
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,208
You go first

974
01:21:29,833 --> 01:21:31,041
Please go

975
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:32,249
Go to where?

976
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:33,458
I want to be with you here

977
01:21:34,958 --> 01:21:36,999
You help dad, go now

978
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,167
You ok to be alone here? Fatty

979
01:21:39,667 --> 01:21:40,874
Go, I'm cool with it

980
01:21:40,875 --> 01:21:42,333
You be careful then

981
01:21:44,833 --> 01:21:46,042
Tell the truth

982
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:48,750
Tell the truth of the power plant

983
01:21:51,417 --> 01:21:54,083
Actually the power plant is safe

984
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:56,458
The biggest problem is...

985
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,041
The drail is stuck a little only

986
01:21:59,042 --> 01:22:00,125
Everything is alright

987
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:02,833
Noname

988
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:05,542
Ok, I tell

989
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:12,999
Actually the radiation of the power plant is very high

990
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,708
How did you fake the report

991
01:22:18,417 --> 01:22:23,082
I hired a professor from Gogoland University...

992
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:25,707
to fake the report for me

993
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:28,541
He's Mark Goh's friend, he introduced to me

994
01:22:28,542 --> 01:22:30,207
He even gave me half price discount

995
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:32,750
You should look for him, I have nothing to do with this

996
01:22:32,958 --> 01:22:35,499
Why did you kill my whole family?

997
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:39,833
At first, I asked Mark Goh to threaten you family

998
01:22:41,292 --> 01:22:43,791
But he killed your family in the end

999
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,250
I never thought of it

1000
01:22:45,292 --> 01:22:46,750
You better tell the truth

1001
01:22:49,125 --> 01:22:50,458
Ok, I tell

1002
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,916
It's all because of me

1003
01:22:53,917 --> 01:22:56,374
I'm the one who command Mark Goh to do so

1004
01:22:56,375 --> 01:22:58,167
But you can't blame me for all this

1005
01:22:58,208 --> 01:23:02,000
Just because you don't mind your own business

1006
01:23:02,292 --> 01:23:06,666
It's not because you want to expose me

1007
01:23:06,667 --> 01:23:09,000
I won't treat you like this

1008
01:23:09,542 --> 01:23:12,582
I have told what I should and shouldn't have to tell

1009
01:23:12,583 --> 01:23:16,417
Are you satisfied now?

1010
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:21,958
They are innocent, please let them go

1011
01:23:22,583 --> 01:23:26,207
Ok, just exchange two lives with your two lives

1012
01:23:26,208 --> 01:23:28,250
Don't kill me!

1013
01:23:43,792 --> 01:23:44,667
Come

1014
01:23:52,625 --> 01:23:56,458
I'm not beaten by my dad since small

1015
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:04,083
You wait a minute

1016
01:24:26,667 --> 01:24:27,667
It's you again

1017
01:24:28,167 --> 01:24:29,667
Why you want to rescue them

1018
01:24:30,292 --> 01:24:31,792
It's me for sure

1019
01:24:32,208 --> 01:24:35,582
Can't you see my whole suit

1020
01:24:35,583 --> 01:24:39,417
I like to help and save people

1021
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:42,457
I'm helping people too

1022
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:45,166
Law can't punish this two idiots

1023
01:24:45,167 --> 01:24:46,832
What's worng with me to do it?

1024
01:24:46,833 --> 01:24:50,666
You are doing right, but you are sinful

1025
01:24:50,667 --> 01:24:54,124
Let God to decide what to do with this two idiots

1026
01:24:54,125 --> 01:24:57,958
God is helpless

1027
01:24:58,542 --> 01:25:00,666
Don't you know this?

1028
01:25:00,667 --> 01:25:03,791
God is watching us, He knows what are we doing

1029
01:25:03,792 --> 01:25:07,167
What are you doing now, God will know

1030
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:10,291
Why, hands itchy?

1031
01:25:10,292 --> 01:25:12,291
Want to fight?

1032
01:25:12,292 --> 01:25:15,124
I'm not scared of you?

1033
01:25:15,125 --> 01:25:16,833
You'll see

1034
01:25:17,625 --> 01:25:19,042
You are doom!

1035
01:25:30,833 --> 01:25:32,000
Noname

1036
01:25:43,542 --> 01:25:45,166
Where have you been?

1037
01:25:45,167 --> 01:25:46,707
I went to toilet

1038
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:48,875
Toilet? I'm helpless here!

1039
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:00,500
See you soon

1040
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,875
You hit my armpit too!

1041
01:28:39,542 --> 01:28:42,917
In this circumstances, pretend to be dead is the best solution

1042
01:28:47,542 --> 01:28:49,499
Like this also can?

1043
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,250
I can't lose then

1044
01:30:58,583 --> 01:31:02,417
Old man, where are you?

1045
01:31:50,333 --> 01:31:52,208
Old man

1046
01:33:12,875 --> 01:33:13,957
Where is my dad

1047
01:33:13,958 --> 01:33:15,082
Why are you here?

1048
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:15,958
I'm here to help you both

1049
01:33:15,959 --> 01:33:17,499
Quickly look for my dad

1050
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:18,750
It's dangerous here, please leave

1051
01:33:32,333 --> 01:33:34,792
I'm sorry, I take revenge for you

1052
01:33:54,958 --> 01:34:00,000
How am I suppose to get someone to marry me with all the scars

1053
01:34:01,667 --> 01:34:03,749
You want to get married too?

1054
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:07,792
I think it's harder than a pig climb a tree!

1055
01:34:08,667 --> 01:34:11,375
You - fatty - pig

1056
01:34:14,625 --> 01:34:16,666
You can say that I am fat

1057
01:34:16,667 --> 01:34:18,625
But you can't say I am a pig!

1058
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:33,042
Oh no!

1059
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,625
Oh my, I kick wrongly!

1060
01:35:20,083 --> 01:35:21,292
You quickly leave!

1061
01:35:26,625 --> 01:35:29,457
What are you still lying there!

1062
01:35:29,458 --> 01:35:33,292
You let go of me, old man!

1063
01:35:42,625 --> 01:35:46,457
I finally realized

1064
01:35:46,458 --> 01:35:50,292
Firefly represents bravery, positivity, and always doing the right thing

1065
01:35:50,667 --> 01:35:52,833
Firefly also represents selflessness.

1066
01:35:53,042 --> 01:35:55,624
We shall keep it

1067
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:58,208
With such courage, anyone can be Firefly.

1068
01:36:12,958 --> 01:36:16,791
The day, Firefly is fighting with Black Hornet

1069
01:36:16,792 --> 01:36:19,166
It's so exciting

1070
01:36:19,167 --> 01:36:20,666
You want to listen?

1071
01:36:20,667 --> 01:36:21,791
Yes

1072
01:36:21,792 --> 01:36:22,917
Let me tell you now

1073
01:36:23,625 --> 01:36:27,458
Firefly use a cup of teh O

1074
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,292
He managed to defeat Noname successfully

1075
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:39,082
Where is your manner, I'm telling story here!

1076
01:36:39,083 --> 01:36:41,916
Go to the back if you don't want to listen

1077
01:36:41,917 --> 01:36:45,750
Take it together with you, mop the floor and wash the cup too

1078
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,417
Where did I stop?

1079
01:36:47,833 --> 01:36:49,833
Defeat noname

1080
01:36:55,958 --> 01:36:58,541
Defeat them all!!!!
