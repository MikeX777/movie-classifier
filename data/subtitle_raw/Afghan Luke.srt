NOT "IN BED".

177
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,130
- OH, WOW.
THAT'S CLEVER.

178
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,040
RIGHT, THAT'S FUNNY, 'CAUSE THAT
"EMBED" IS LIKE "IN BED"?

179
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,140
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE
TRYING TO--

180
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,050
WOW, YOU'RE A WIZARD.

181
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,200

[clears throat]

184
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,160
THE FACT CHECKERS ARE UNEASY.

185
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,190
- UNEASY.
- YEAH.

186
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,110
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE LIKE.

187
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,080
BESIDES NO PHOTOGRAPHIC
EVIDENCE, NO WITNESSES.

188
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,120
THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO START
INSULTING THE MILITARY.

189
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:21,080
- I--NO, I SAW THIS
WITH MY OWN EYES.

190
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,000
IT IS ALL THERE IN
SOME AFGHAN GRAVE.

191
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,060
I WITNESSED THIS.

192
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,110
- YOU SAW WHAT YOU WANTED
TO SEE.

193
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,180
- [scoffs]

194
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,100
WE BOTH KNOW THAT IS NOT TRUE.

195
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,210
- LOOK, IF IT WAS UP TO ME...

196
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,140
- IT IS UP TO YOU, MARK.

197
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,230
- TO CHOOSE WHAT?

198
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,110
BETWEEN A DECORATED SNIPER

199
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,000
AND SOME DEAD TALIBAN'S
MISSING FINGER?

200
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,230
[laughs]

201
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,210
WHO CARES ABOUT
A FUCKING FINGER?

202
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,160
LOOK, I'M NOT TRYING TO BE
CALLOUS HERE, MAN,

203
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,110
BUT NOBODY GIVES A SHIT.

204
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,050
- TECHNICALLY, IT'S MUTILATION.
THAT IS A WAR CRIME.

205
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,150
- DON'T GIVE ME THAT
JOURNALISM SCHOOL CRAP.

206
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,000
WHAT, PUTTING A BULLET THROUGH A
MAN'S HEART IS NOT A WAR CRIME?

207
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,100
- IT'S A WAR.
I--

208
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:58,150
MY JOB IS TO REPORT WHAT I SEE.

209
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:03,080
- WELL, THIS IS NOT A STORY
THIS PAPER'S GONNA RUN...

210
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,060

216
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,030
SIT TIGHT, THERE MAY BE
SOME CHANGES, HMM?

218
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,010
MAN'S GOT TO EAT, RIGHT?

219
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,150

224
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,130
- THANK YOU.

225
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,070
- WE ARE LIVING IN
VERY EXCITING TIMES.

ALL OF THESE MEDIA--
PRINT, TV, THE INTERNET--

227
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,230
THEY'RE ALL CONVERGING.

228
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,210

PROPOSITION ANYMORE.

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,120
YOU WANT TO COMPETE?

230
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,150

[chair squeaks]

237
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:38,170
JOURNALISTS MUST STRIVE EVEN
HARDER TO BE FAIR AND BALANCED,

238
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,180
TO CHOOSE FACT OVER FICTION,

239
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,110
TRUTH OVER PROPAGANDA,

240
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,100
SOBRIETY OVER SENSATIONALISM--

241
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,170
- AND FOR ALL THAT WOULDN'T YOU
SAY THAT WE STILL SPEAK

242
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,070
TRUTH TO POWER?

243
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,210

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,100
THEY SHOOT AFGHAN HORSES,
DON'T THEY?

249
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:14,120
AN AWARD WINNER FOR SURE.

250
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,020
- WELL, I WOULD HAVE TO
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

251
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,190
GIVE THE CONSUMERS WHAT THEY
WANT WHEN THEY WANT IT.

252
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,230
RIGHT?
THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN THIS GAME.

253
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,220
BUT REMEMBER, KIDS,

254
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,160
IN JOURNALISM, THERE ARE
NO ALLIES, ONLY FUTURE ENEMIES.

255
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,160
- GREAT.

256

517
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,100
[tank whirring]

518
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,230
[gunshot]

519
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,190
HEY, WATCH IT,
FULL METAL JACKASS.

520
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,180

521
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:53,050

522
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,190

523
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,030
- YES.

524
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,030
- UM, ARE THESE YOUR TANKS?

525
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,110
- YEAH, YEAH, THEY ARE.

526
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,170
- CAN I TRY?

527
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
- YEAH, OKAY, YEAH.
- YEAH?

528
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,200
- YEAH, GO TO TOWN.

529
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,050
- BE CAREFUL.

530
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,060
- WELL, I WON'T GO TO TOWN,
BUT...

531
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,050
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

532
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,180
[chuckling]

533
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,100
- OKAY, I THINK OUR TAXI
MIGHT BE HERE.

534
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,190
- TAXI?

535
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,230
- YOU REMEMBER THAT KID
LAST NIGHT, THAT RAPPER?

536
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,170
- WELL, I STAYED TO TALK TO HIM
AFTER HIS ATROCIOUSLY BAD SET,

537
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,210
AND IT TURNS OUT HIS UNCLE IS,
LIKE, SOME KIND OF OFFICIAL.

538
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,070
APPARENTLY HE'S IN CHARGE OF ALL
THE DOPE FIELDS IN THE COUNTRY.

539
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,200
HE'S LIKE THE MINISTER OF HASH
OR SOMETHING.

540
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,100
- HE'S IN THE GOVERNMENT?
- YEAH, HE'S IN THE GOVERNMENT.

541
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,120
- HOW?
WHAT'D YOU SAY TO HIM?

542
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,050
- NOTHING.

543
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,030
JUST, YOU KNOW, TOLD THE KID
WE WERE MUSIC EXECUTIVES,

544
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,030
AND MAYBE WE COULD HELP HIM
GET A RECORD DEAL.

545
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,230
I MEAN, AT THE VERY LEAST,
IT'LL BE INTERESTING.

546
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,100
HOW OFTEN DO YOU GET A CHANCE TO
MEET A GUY LIKE THIS?

547
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:40,200
COME ON, MAN.
WE'RE IN AFGHANISTAN.

548
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,070
WE NEED TO GET SOME HASH.

549
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,010
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH,
WE'LL GO TO THE MEETING,

550
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,140
BUT WE HAVE TO GET A FIXER RIGHT
AFTERWARDS AND GO TO SHIRAC,

551
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,030
OKAY?
- NO PROBLEM.

552
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,210
- IMRAN AND  THE TIMES,
THAT WAS INEVITABLE.

553
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,150
LIKE TOM AND HASH.

554
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,020
BUT IMRAN'S GOING STRAIGHT
TO SHIRAC,

555
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,050
AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE
A FIXER NOW.

556
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,050
MAYBE TOM'S GOVERNMENT GUY,
ONE OF THOSE WARLORD TYPES,

557
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,210
GET YOU ANYTHING.

558
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,220
- THANKS, BOSS.
WE'RE GONNA BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

559
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,070
OKAY, JUST WAIT HERE.

560
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,230
WE'LL BE BACK IN, LIKE,
HALF AN HOUR.

561
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,170
COOL, THANK YOU.
JESUS.

562
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,190
[goat braying]

563
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,040
KID TOLD ME TO WAIT
AT THE MARKET.

564
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,170
SAID SOMEBODY WOULD FIND US AND
TAKE US TO THE MEETING.

565
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,010
I DON'T KNOW.

566
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,180
[chicken clucking]

567
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,160
- THAT'S MATEEN?

568
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,020
- HOW YOU DOING?
NICE TO SEE YOU.

569
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,110
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

570
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,120
DO YOU THINK THAT
WE'RE ALL STUPID?

571
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,150
HEY, GOOD BOY.
- HEY, RELAX.

572
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,160
- HEY, I'M TALKING TO
YOUR FRIEND.

573
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,080
LEAVE US.

574
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:04,170
- YEAH, GIVE US A SECOND.

575
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,070
- BULLSHIT, MAN.

576
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,230
- YES, OKAY, PLEASE GO BACK TO
FOO FIGHTERS, OKAY?

577
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,060
- YEAH, HILARIOUS.

578
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,200
- I HEAR YOU ARE
MUSIC EXECUTIVE.

579
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,100
- THAT WASN'T MY IDEA.

580
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:14,010
- WELL, AND WHAT IS THIS
BULLSHIT ABOUT HASH IN SHIRAC?

581
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,200
YOU KNOW AND I KNOW
THERE'S NOTHING IN SHIRAC

582
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,070
EXCEPT MISSING FINGERS.

583
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,000
- DID YOU TELL IMRAN THAT?

584
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,150
DOES HE KNOW?

585
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,150
- OF COURSE I TELL HIM.

586
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,110
HE PAY ME THE BIG MONEY.

587
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,180
BUT I THINK MAYBE YOU ARE
THE ONLY ONE WHO CARES.

588
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,140
BUT I'M NOT SURE EVEN YOU CARE,
NOT REALLY,

589
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:29,060
EXCEPT THE WAY THAT IMRAN CARES,
YOU KNOW?

590
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,190
FOR HIS PICTURE IN THE PAPER,
HE CARE.

591
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,190
- WHAT DO YOU WANT, MATEEN?

592
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,130
- HEY.
HEY.

593
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,120
- THIS MEETING YOU ARE HAVING
WITH ASSAD, HUH?

594
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,110
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

595
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,070
YOU'RE DEALING WITH SOME
VERY DANGEROUS PEOPLE HERE.

596
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,190
YOU NEED ME.
- YOU LEFT ME OUT THERE.

597
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,130
- YOUR HORSE KNEW THE WAY HOME,
DIDN'T HE?

598
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,020
- HE DI--IT TOOK ME LIKE A MONTH
TO GET BACK.

599
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,140
- WHAT IS A MONTH?

600
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:53,170
IN AFGHANISTAN,
A MONTH IS NOTHING.

601
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,210
- I DON'T NEED YOU TO GET BACK
TO SHIRAC, OKAY?

602
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,120
- YOU DON'T NEED ME?
- NO, I DON'T.

603
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,020
- FINE, HERE, HERE.

604
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,160
TAKE YOUR CANYON DAM PODDING
PIECE OF SHIT.

605
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,150
I ALSO PUT IN THIRD PARTY
NEW BATTERY.

606
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,060
FIRST BATTERY WAS SHIT,
KEPT TURNING ITSELF ON.

607
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,200
THIS BATTERY MUCH BETTER.

608
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,030
LASTS SIX HOURS NOW.

609
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,230
FINE, GOOD-BYE.

610
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,230
[speaking foreign language]

611
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,210
- HEY, MATEEN?

612
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,040
- [speaking foreign language]

613
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,160
- MATEEN?
- WHAT?

614
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,020
- I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE
WORKING WITH IMRAN.

615
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:36,010
I DO KIND OF NEED YOU,
ALL RIGHT?

616
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,130
- OKAY, BUT THIS IS
LAST CHANCE FOR YOU

617
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,170
TO BE HUMAN BEING WITH ME,
YOU UNDERSTAND, BIG SHOT?

618
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,060
OKAY, LET'S GET FOO FIGHTER
AND BACK TO BASE.

619
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,090
MUSIC EXECUTIVES.
IDIOT.

620
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,050
- HEY, I GOT THE MEETING,
DIDN'T I?

621
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,180
- YES, BY LIES TO ASSAD.

622
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,080
SHOULD TALK RIGHT TO ASSAD.

623
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:04,200
HE WILL KILL YOU.
WE SHOULD NOT DO THIS MEETING.

624
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,120
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WE'RE DOING THE MEETING.

625
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,140
- LUKE, I AM TELLING YOU
WE SHOULD NOT DO THIS MEETING.

626
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,100
- WE'RE GOING AHEAD AS PLANNED,
AND WE'RE DOING THIS MEETING.

627
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:12,010
- YOU CANNOT DO THIS MEETING.
- WE'RE DOING THE MEETING.

628
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,160
- WE SHOULD NOT DO THIS MEETING.
- MATEEN, SHUT UP!

629
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,040
THIS GUY'S GONNA HOOK US UP
WITH PREMIUM HASH.

630
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,210
WE'RE HAVING THE MEETING.
END OF STORY.

631
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,180
- I MEAN, WE--WE ARE HERE,
YOU KNOW?

632
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,180
WE MIGHT AS WELL JUST DO IT.

633
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,140
- HE'S HERE.
GET UP, GET UP, THIS IS HIM.

634
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,060
- GOOD.

635
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,160
[clears throat]

636
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,140
- HEY, FOO FIGHTER,
NO MINISTER OF HASH.

637
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,060
IT'S VERY INSULTING.

638
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,180
- [speaking foreign language]

639
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,170
WELCOME.

640
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,060
COME IN.

641
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,220
- SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS,

642
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,210
WE KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO MIGHT BE INTERESTED.

643
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,140
WE'RE PRETTY WELL CONNECTED
IN THE BUSINESS IN NEW YORK.

644
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,120
I'M PERSONALLY REALLY
WELL CONNECTED IN THE--

645
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,120
- WELL, YOUR CONNECTIONS
IN NEW YORK,

646
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,170
WOULD THEY BE INTERESTED

647
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,090
IN SIGNING MY NEPHEW
TO RECORD DEAL?

648
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,130
THE BOY YOU SAW LAST NIGHT
AT THE GENGHIS.

649
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,130
- OH, YEAH, HE'S FULL OF TALENT.

650
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,190
I HAVE NO PROBLEM SIGNING HIM.

651
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,080
YOU KNOW, TALKING TO MY BUDDIES
ABOUT SIGNING HIM.

652
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,070
- HE'S GOOD.
YOU'RE VERY FUNNY.

653
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,200
YOU MUST BE MUSIC EXECUTIVE,
BECAUSE YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT.

654
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,060
[chuckling]

655
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,200
MY NEPHEW'S NOT GREAT.

656
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,180
HE'S FUCKING TERRIBLE, MAN.
- TERRIBLE FLOW.

657
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:46,100
- BUT HE'S MY NEPHEW.
WHAT CAN I DO?

658
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,200
HOWEVER, SOME OF THESE OTHER
AFGHAN RAPPERS,

659
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,050
THEY ARE VERY GOOD.

660
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,210
SO PLEASE, WE WILL HAVE CDs
WAITING FOR YOU.

661
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,010
- I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE
A PROBLEM TO HELP YOU

662
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,130
GET A RECORD DEAL.

663
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,190
- WHAT IS IT YOU WANT FROM ME?

664
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,140
- UM...HASH?

665
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:02,060
LOTS OF IT.
MAYBE ALSO TO FILM IT.

666
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,050
MAYBE FILM ALL OF US
SMOKING AROUND THE TABLE.

667
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,060
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, MAYBE KEEP
SOME OF IT AFTER,

668
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,070
BUT FOR, YOU KNOW, A GOOD PRICE.

669
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,220
- OH, OF COURSE FOR GOOD PRICE.

670
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,230
[speaking foreign language]

671
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,200
- WHAT, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

672
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,170
- I SAID, "WHAT IS IT
WITH WHITE GUYS AND HASH?

673
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,210
AND THEY ALWAYS SAY,
'GOOD PRICE.'"

674
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,120
- GENTLEMEN.

675
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,100
- OUR'S IS AROMATIC.

676
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,170
SPICY.

677
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,040
A SWEET, GENEROUS SUBSTANCE

678
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,170
GROWN ORGANICALLY WITHOUT
HARMFUL PESTICIDES,

679
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:38,000
BUT EACH REGION HAS ITS
OWN PECULIAR SET OF INGREDIENTS

680
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,050
WHICH MAKES FOR A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT TASTE

681
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,200
AND SENSORY EXPERIENCE.

682
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,230
IT IS WHAT THE FRENCH CALL
TERROIR.

683
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,210
- AH, YES, THE WAR ON  TERROIR.

684
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,060
[chuckling]

689
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,220
I HAD A LADY FRIEND ONCE.

690
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,140
BRUBA WAS HER NAME.

691
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,120
SHE WAS A NICE GIRL,
SWEET LIKE OUR HASH.

692
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:14,010
ANYWAY, ONE DAY,
WE WERE HAVING A PICNIC.

693
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,190
I DON'T REMEMBER.

694
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,180
WE WERE DISCUSSING EXISTENTIAL
MOTIFS IN RUSSIAN POETRY.

695
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,110
BUT SHE SAID SOMETHING
VERY PROFOUND TO ME.

696
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:24,000
SHE SAID, "ASSAD, AN OUNCE
OF BLOOD IS WORTH MORE

697
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,220
THAN A POUND OF FRIENDSHIP."

698
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,060
SIX WEEKS LATER, HER FATHER
FOUND OUT WE WERE DATING,

699
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,190
AND HE SHOT HER IN THE BACK.

- DID THEY LEAVE?
FUCK!

855
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,190
I'M NOT LATE.

856
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,150
I DON'T SEE MATEEN.
WHERE'S MATEEN?

857
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,120
- I WOULD HAVE LEFT WITHOUT YOU.
I CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT MATEEN.

858
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,200
- HOW COULD THEY LEAVE WITHOUT
THE CNN GUY?

859
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,010
- [chuckles]

860
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,010
- WHAT CNN GUY?

861
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,140
WHAT CNN GUY?

862
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,080
- THIS DOESN'T CONCERN YOU.

863
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:17,100
- ARE YOU TELLING PEOPLE
THAT YOU WORK FOR CNN?

864
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,170
- THIS GUY.
HE WORKS FOR CNN.

865
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,110
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

866
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,180
- YES.

867
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:25,000
- HANG ON A SECOND, MISS.

868
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:28,000
TOM, DO YOU WORK FOR CNN?

869
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:29,120
- NO.

870
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:33,070
- CNN IS PAYING YOU?
THEY'RE PAYING YOU?

871
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,050
- NO, IMRAN,
THEY'RE NOT PAYING ME.

872
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,030
- OH.
- YET.

873
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,130
I'M PAYING FOR ALL THIS MYSELF.

874
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,150
I'M A FREELANCE DOCUMENTARY
FILMMAKER,

875
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,080
AND I HOPE TO SELL MY DOC
TO THEM EVENTUALLY.

876
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,180
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

877
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,110
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU, REALLY?
- THAT'S FINE, YEAH.

878
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,130
THAT'S FINE.
- GOOD.

879
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,130
- STOP, IT'S THE OTHER PART

880
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,230
THAT I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH.

881
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,000
- YEAH, SORRY FOR BEING
A POSITIVE THINKER.

882
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,200
I MAY HAVE GOTTEN
A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY.

883
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,130
IT MIGHT'VE COME OUT.

884
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,190
BUT I NEVER ACTUALLY SAID
THE WORDS, "I WORK FOR CNN."

885
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,090
- THAT'S ENOUGH, ALL RIGHT?

886
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,000
- WHERE'S YOUR SENSE OF ETHICS?

887
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:11,020
THIS JACKASS IS TELLING PEOPLE
THAT HE WORKS FOR CNN.

888
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:15,020
THAT LOWERS THE BAR
FOR ALL OF US.

889
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:17,020
- BOSS, I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
IF YOU WORK FOR CBC.

890
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:19,010
IS SOMEONE GETTING IN
THE FUCKIN' LAV TODAY?

891
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:24,020
- CBC.

892
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,180
THAT'S YOUR GOAL.

893
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,030
- LUKE.

894
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,030
- MATEEN, WHERE THE FUCK
HAVE YOU BEEN, MAN?

895
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,130
WE MISSED OUR RIDE.

896
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,190
- IT'S OKAY, LUKE.
WE GO IN THIS TAXI.

897
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,000
CONVOYS ARE TARGETS.

898
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,100
THIS MUCH SAFER.

899
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,060
- THIS IS THE SAFEST VEHICLE
IN AFGHANISTAN.

900
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:51,150
- HEY, LET ME INTRODUCE
USTAD MIR.

901
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,020
- USTAD WHAT?
- USTAD MIR, MEANS TEACHER.

902
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,080
- SALAAM.
- HOW YOU DOING?

903
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,030
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO THEN.

904
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,060
- DUDE, I GOT TO BRING AT LEAST
ONE OF MY TANKS.

905
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:00,020
- YOU HAVE TO?
- YEAH, I DO.

906
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,120
WHAT I'M WORKING ON IS
IMPORTANT TOO, LUKE.

907
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,160
MIGHT NOT BE AS IMPORTANT
AS YOUR STORY,

908
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:05,160
BUT IT MATTERS TO ME.

909
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:07,140
I'VE GOT TO GET SOME SHOTS.

910
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:10,130
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.

911
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,180
OKAY, I'M JUST--
I'M SORRY THAT I LIED TO YOU.

912
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:16,230
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL,

913
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,160
AND I REALLY DIDN'T THINK
I HAD A CHANCE WITH YOU.

914
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:21,030
AND I JUST--I WAS EXCITED.

915
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,180
JUST KIND OF FUCKING
CAME OUT OF MY MOUTH,

916
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,230
ALL THAT STUPID CNN SHIT.

917
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,210
IT'S JUST--YOU KNOW, I WAS
JUST TRYING TO IMPRESS YOU.

918
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,180
I'M AN IDIOT,
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

919
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:36,190
SO I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE ME
AND, YOU KNOW, HAVE A GOOD LIFE.

920
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,210
- HEY.

921
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,120
I THOUGHT YOU WERE FAMOUS,

922
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,220
BUT I LIKE UNFAMOUS PEOPLE TOO.

923
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:49,000
- REALLY?

924
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,160
- SO WHAT IS IT THAT
YOU'RE DOING?

925
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,110
- THE VILLAGE NEEDS
A HEARING CLINIC.

926
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,080
PEOPLE MARRY THEIR FIRST COUSINS
TO KEEP PROPERTY IN THE FAMILY.

927
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,130
CONGENITAL DEAFNESS
IS VERY COMMON.

928
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,090
IT HAPPENS IN ARAB COUNTRIES
AND IN PARTS OF ISRAEL.

929
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:20,220
IT'S A BIG PROBLEM
EASILY SOLVED.

930
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:23,110
- SO WE'RE DESTROYING
THEIR ONLY CASH CROP,

931
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,090
AND YOU'RE BUILDING THEM
CLINICS?

932
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,080
- AS THE RUSSIANS USED TO SAY
WHEN THEY CAME,

933
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:30,210
"SNAFU: SITUATION NORMAL,
ALL FUCKED UP."

934
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,230
- ELITA!

935
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,190
- HI.

936
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,150
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

937
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:51,000
- WELL, I AM COMMUNITY LIAISON

938
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:55,080
SO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THEM
WHY WE ARE BURNING THEIR FIELDS.

939
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,150
- [speaking foreign language]

940
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,010
- HE SAYS HE WANTS TO THANK US
FOR COMING HERE, BUT HE CANNOT.

941
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,140
- [speaking foreign language]

942
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,210
- SAYS YOU HAVE JUST DESTROYED
ALL HIS FIELDS.

943
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,100
- [speaking foreign language]

944
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,160
- HE HAS NOTHING LEFT.
ONLY HIS GUN.

945
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:10,030
- [speaking foreign language]

946
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,130
- HE SAYS WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE SHOULD DO?

947
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,230
- [speaking foreign language]

948
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,160
- HE WANTS YOU TO KNOW
HE IS NOT TALIBAN.

949
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:18,120
- [speaking foreign language]

950
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,160
- SHOULD HE JOIN THE TALIBAN?

951
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:21,080
- [speaking foreign language]

952
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:24,100
- TELL HIM I'M A JOURNALIST.
I'M A JOURNALIST.

953
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,180
- HEY, HEY, OH.

954
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:29,090
[speaking foreign language]

955
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,210
- [speaking foreign language]

956
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,050
- HE SAYS YOU WILL
GO BACK TO KABUL

957
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,200
AND DRINK AND BE WITH LADIES
AND FORGET ABOUT HIM.

958
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:49,080
- IT'S KIND OF TRUE, LUKE.

959
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,010
- USTAD MIR THINKS ONLY
THE CONVOY'S A TARGET.

960
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,050
BUT EVEN WITH ROADSIDE BOMBS,
THERE'S SAFETY IN NUMBERS.

961
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,140
NOW WE'RE JUST THE WEAK MEMBER
OF THE HERD.

962
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:14,020
- HONESTLY, THE BEST DESIGN
WOULD BE...

963
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:16,090
- BREATHE DEEP, BREATHE DEEP!

964
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:19,160
- TAKE SOME SOUVENIRS?

965
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:21,140
- ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH WITH
THE POT JOKES!

966
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:24,050
WE'RE NOT HERE TO SMOKE IT.
WE'RE HERE TO CUT IT DOWN.

967
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,170
ALL RIGHT, STOP--

968
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,180
[machine guns firing]

969
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,130
- GET HIM SOME HELP!

970
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,080
STAY FUCKIN' DOWN!

971
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:47,230
GO, GO, GO, GO!

972
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,030
MOVE IT!
MOVE IT!

973
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,170
- THEY'RE FUCKING LEAVING US.

974
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:57,150
JESUS FUCK, LUKE,
WE GOT TO GET BACK TO THE BASE.

975
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,120
- WE'RE NOT GOING BACK, TOM.
WE'RE GOING TO SHIRAC.

976
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,020
- I DIDN'T SIGN ONTO THIS STORY
TO GET FUCKING KILLED, LUKE!

977
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:03,110
- YOU WANT TO GO?
YOU FUCKING GO.

978
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,180
YOU'RE GONNA BE ON YOUR OWN.

979
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:06,100
ALL RIGHT, I TOLD YOU.

980
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:09,130
I FUCKIN' TOLD YOU
I WASN'T GONNA BABYSIT YOU.

981
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,140
- LET'S GET THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE.

982
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,120
LET'S GO.

983
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:24,090
- HARD TO TELL THE GOOD GUYS
FROM THE BAD GUYS HERE

984
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,090
TILL THEY TRY TO KILL YOU.

985
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,170
THEN YOU MEET SOMEONE
LIKE USTAD MIR.

986
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,210
SAVES YOUR ASS FOR NO REASON,
DOES IT JUST FOR FUN.

987
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,070
THAT'S A RUSSIAN PLANE.

988
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,140
- COURTESY OF STINGER MISSILE.

989
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:41,230
- THIS LOOKS LIKE A GOOD PLACE
FOR THE NIGHT.

990
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,110
- WHAT, IT'S PLAYTIME FOR YOU?

991
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,080
WHAT THE FUCK HE'S DOING?

992
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:06,040
- WHAT DO YOU WANT IN SHIRAC?

993
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:08,190
- I'M A JOURNALIST.

994
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,210
I'M WRITING A STORY ABOUT

995
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,140
HOW A BUNCH OF TALIBAN WERE
KILLED BY ONE SNIPER IN SHIRAC.

996
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:16,050
- OH, YES.

997
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,170
- YOU'VE HEARD OF THIS?
- EVERYONE HAS.

998
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,110
THERE WAS A GREAT MAN, HAKIM,

999
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,150
WHO WAS SHOT WITH
TWO OF HIS SONS.

1000
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,050
I KNEW HIM.

1001
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,050
I THOUGHT THIS GROUP COULD
SUPPORT THE AFGHAN PEOPLE,

1002
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,030
BUT I WAS WRONG.

1003
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,080
SO I WORK FOR THEM FOR A WHILE,

1004
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:41,160
BUT I SWITCH SIDES
AND I JOINED THE DUSHKIES.

1005
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:44,040
- THE DUSHKIES?

1006
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:45,180
SOUNDS LIKE A FOLK BAND.

1007
00:48:45,210 --> 00:48:49,160
- SOVIET SOLDIERS CALLED
MUJAHIDEEN "DUSHKIE."

1008
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:51,130
IT MEANS GHOST IN RUSSIAN.

1009
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,090
- WE CAME AND WENT LIKE SPIRITS.

1010
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,200
WE CHANGED SIDES ALL THE TIME.

1011
00:48:56,230 --> 00:49:00,130
- THERE ARE NO ENEMIES
IN AFGHANISTAN,

1012
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,050
ONLY FUTURE ALLIES.

1013
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,020
- WHEN I FIRST COME
TO AFGHANISTAN,

1014
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:10,130
I AM WITH THE RED CROSS THEN.

1015
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,080
I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO KABUL,

1016
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:16,210
AND WE ARE THERE TO NEGOTIATE
FOR WOMEN TO USE THE HOSPITALS.

1017
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,020
IMAGINE, WOMEN COULD NOT HAVE
MALE DOCTOR UNDER TALIBAN.

1018
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:22,200
IT WAS INSANE.

1019
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:24,210
I AM THE ONLY WOMAN
IN THE GROUP,

1020
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,100
AND THE FUCKIN' TURBANS MAKE ME
SIT AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM

1021
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:35,140
DURING MEETINGS IN A BURKA,
BUT I GET THEM.

1022
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:36,220
- HOW?

1023
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:38,230
- WELL, I SIT AT BACK OF ROOM,

1029
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,230

MEN, YOU KNOW,
THEY WANT TO SAVE YOU

1033
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,040
OR THEY WANT YOU TO SAVE THEM.

1034
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:16,020
THE ONES THAT WANT JUST SEX
MUCH EASIER TO DEAL WITH.

1035
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,130

- MAYBE YOU WANT EVERYTHING.

1040
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:30,060
TO SAVE PEOPLE AND BE SAVED
AND THE SEX.

1041
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:32,230
THIS IS DIFFICULT CONFUSION.

1042
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,150

HE'S GONE.

1047
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,160
I LOOKED EVERYWHERE.

00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,230
HIS TRUCK IS HERE,
BUT HE'S GONE.

1049
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,210
- WHERE WOULD HE GO?

1050
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,190
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
LIKE KIDNAPPED OR WHAT?

1051
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:52,000
- NO, THEY WOULD'VE
TAKEN US ALL.

1053
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:56,150

PLAYED WITH DECAPITATED GOATS.

1072

00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,050
- C-6, C-6, C-6!

1196
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,190
GET THOSE FUCKERS
UP ON THE RIDGE.

1197
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,070
GO, GO, GO!

1198
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:06,080
[gun cocking]

1199
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:09,110
[machine gun firing]

1200
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:53,210
- CLEAR!

1201
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,060
- CLEAR!

1202
01:00:56,090 --> 01:00:59,070
[fast breathing]

1203
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,140
- LUKE, LUKE!

1204
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:05,160
[tank engine turns over]

1205
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:07,040
LUKE, WE GO.
WHAT?

1206
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:09,070
- THERE WAS A BOMB IN THE TRUCK.
- WHAT?

1207
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,060
- THERE WAS A BOMB IN THE TRUCK.

1208
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:12,150
- LET'S GO.
LET'S GO.

1209
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:40,170
- COULD WE GET--

1210
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,180
[quiet sobbing]

1211
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:49,080
COULD WE GET A BAG?

1212
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:51,060
WE LOST DAVEY.

1213
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,150
FUCK.

1214
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:02,140
- RICK, I'M GONNA GO TO
THE NEXT VILLAGE

1215
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:04,020
AND FIND OUT WHO THIS
LITTLE GIRL IS.

1216
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,100
DROP THEM OFF.
COME BACK FOR ME, ALL RIGHT?

1217
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:08,140
GOT SOME FUCKIN' GREAT SHOTS,
MAN.

1218
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:27,170
- USTAD MIR BETRAYED US,
TRIED TO KILL US.

1219
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,140
I SHOULD'VE PICKED UP ON HIM.

1220
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:32,000
WHY ELSE WOULD HE JUST DISAPPEAR
LIKE THAT?

1221
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:33,080
HOW CAN YOU WIN A WAR

1222
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:34,180
WHERE YOU CAN'T TELL
THE DIFFERENCE

1223
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:37,230
BETWEEN A TAXI DRIVER
AND THE TALIBAN?

1224
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,180
MAKES ME WONDER WHAT ANY OF US
ARE DOING HERE.

1225
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:44,090
ARE WE SERIOUSLY TRYING TO SOLVE
THIS PLACE?

1226
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:59,070
YEAH, YOU LIKE?

1227
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,150
- SOMEONE ONCE SAID TO ME,

1228
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,010
"BELIEVING THERE IS A SOLUTION,

1229
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:09,210
"THAT'S OUR WHOLE
FUCKING PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH.

1230
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,050
NOW, WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO SURVIVE LIKE THE AFGHANS."

1231
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:25,020
- HEY, MATEEN.

1232
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:32,020
- HEY, LUKE.
CHECK THIS OUT.

1233
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:33,220
IT'S ENFIELD.

1234
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:36,100
MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER TOOK IT OFF
DEAD BRITISHER.

1235
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:37,230
MY BROTHER USED IT
AGAINST RUSSIAN.

1236
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,160
- TOM'S BREAKING DOWN.

1237
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:12,030
THE HASH, THE FOOD, THE WATER,
THE HEAT--HE'S FUCKED.

1238
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:13,190
HOPE IT'S NOT DYSENTERY.

1239
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:16,120
TOLD HIM TO STICK TO THE TEA.

1240
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:17,140
- OH!

1241
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:20,190
[groaning]

1242
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,140
-  ACHMAD  SHAH,

1243
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:25,010
BUT YOU CAN CALL ME SHITHOUSE.

1244
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,070
PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN.
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

1245
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,170
THAT WAS QUITE A FALL.
ARE YOU OKAY?

1246
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,080
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE,
MY FRIEND?

1247
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:33,020
- OH, THERE'S MORE PEOPLE.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1248
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:34,200
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
- OH, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

1249
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:36,040
I'M SHITHOUSE SHAH.

1250
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:37,090
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL ME
AROUND HERE.

1251
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,220
OH, IT'S SO GREAT TO SEE YOU.

1252
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:40,180
YEAH, YEAH, HOW YOU DOING?
HOW YOU DOING?

1253
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:43,210
- MR. SHITHOUSE?
- YEAH, YEAH.

1254
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,170
- THAT'S RIGHT,
SHITHOUSE, SHIT.

1255
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,080
CALL ME WHATEVER YOU WANT.
I'M JUST SO GLAD TO SEE YOU.

1256
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:48,160
- YEAH.
- [stammers]

1257
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:50,000
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

1258
01:04:50,030 --> 01:04:51,050
ARE YOU OKAY?
- YEAH, I'M GOOD.

1259
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,070
- WHAT ARE YOU--
ARE YOU AMERICAN?

1260
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:53,130
- LATVIAN.
- CANADIAN.

1261
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,110
- CANADIAN.
- I LOVE CANADIANS.

1262
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:57,150
AND--AND LATVIANS.

1263
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:58,190
- WHAT IS IT YOU DO?

1264
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:01,020
- ME?
I'M A PLUMBER.

1265
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:03,200
- PLUMBER?
- YEAH, BROOKLYN, AVENUE "A".

1266
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,170
YOU KNOW THAT--

1267
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:09,150
YOU KNOW THAT BAD WATER
AND POOR SANITATION

1268
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:13,130
KILL MORE PEOPLE HERE
THAN NATO OR THE TALIBAN DO?

1269
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:16,110
I'M SERIOUS.

1270
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:18,090
WE'D BE BETTER OFF
WITH ONE PLUMBER

1271
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,200
THAN 100 SPECIAL FORCES DUDES.

1272
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:23,060
YEAH, AFGHANISTAN DOESN'T NEED
MORE SOLDIERS.

1273
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:27,080
WHAT IT NEEDS IS MORE TOILETS
AND CLEAN WATER.

1274
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:28,160
I MEAN, JUST LOOK AROUND.

1275
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:31,180
IT'S POVERTY, BRO.

1276
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:33,080
THESE PEOPLE?
THEY JUST WANT TO SURVIVE.

1277
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:37,030
AND FAMILY IS--
IT'S ALL THEY GOT.

1278
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:40,010
- FAMILY VALUES.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

1279
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:44,130
AND REAL FAMILY VALUES, NOT
THE TAKEOUT FAMILY PACK KIND.

1280
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,160
HEY, YOU GUYS SHOULD STAY OVER.

1281
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:52,220
- OH, YEAH, WE'D LOVE TO,
BUT WE GOT TO HIT THE ROAD.

1282
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:54,110
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

1283
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:56,010
YOU'RE STAYING OVER.
I INSIST.

1284
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,080
IT'S ON ME, PLEASE...

1285
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:58,210
AS MY GUESTS.

1286
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:07,130
- WHATEVER USTAD MIR DID,

1287
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:10,180
HE WAS--HE WAS RIGHT
ABOUT ONE THING.

1288
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:15,120
VILLAGES, THEY NEED BASIC
HEALTH CARE, EVEN JUST A CLINIC.

1289
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,200
FORGET THIS FINGER.

1290
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:22,230
STAY HERE WITH ME.

1291
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:26,200
AND YOU CAN DO
SOMETHING USEFUL ALSO.

1292
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:28,050
- USEFUL?

1293
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,070
- YEAH, MAKE THESE TOILETS
WITH MR. SHAH.

1294
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,130
- I COULD--I'M TELLING YOU--

1295
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,120
I COULD USE YOUR HELP,
SERIOUSLY.

1296
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:36,090
- I'M A JOURNALIST.

1297
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,210
- YEAH, HE'S ALREADY
FULL OF SHIT.

1298
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:38,220
[laughter]

1299
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:40,020
- THAT'S--I LIKE THAT.

1300
01:06:40,050 --> 01:06:43,200
- I SPEAK SERIOUSLY.

1301
01:06:43,230 --> 01:06:48,020
THIS OBSESSION WITH THE TRUTH
IS TOO STUPID.

1302
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:50,220
WE ARE NEARLY KILLED.

1303
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:53,190
THIS IS AFGHANISTAN.

1304
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:55,020
TRUTH?

1305
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:56,150
EVERYTHING IS TRUE...

1306
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,230
BUT THE FACTS.

1307
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:02,030
AND WHO CARES?

1308
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:06,010
IT'S BETTER TO DO SOMETHING.

1309
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:08,030
- YOU'RE GONNA--
YOU'RE GONNA STAY HERE.

1310
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:12,120
- YES, I WILL STAY HERE.

1311
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:14,230
MY WORK MAKES A DIFFERENCE HERE.

1312
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:19,050
I WILL NOT WATCH YOUR KIDNAPPING
ON YOUTUBE.

1313
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,120
I'M GOING TO STAY HERE.

1314
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:24,100
I'M NOT GOING WITH YOU
TO SHIRAC.

1315
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:26,050
YOU ARE A FOOL.

1316
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:30,110
TELL ME, WHAT GOOD IS IT
TO DIE FOR AMBITION?

1317
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:32,110
HMM?

1318
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:43,130
- WHAT THE SHIT IS THIS?

1319
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:47,040
IT'S OKAY.
SHOULD BE OKAY.

1320
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:48,090
WE SHOULD CHECK IT OUT.

1321
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,210
- SOMETHING SMELLS DELICIOUS.

1322
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,080
- [speaking foreign language]

1323
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:03,000
[speaking foreign language]

1324
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,010
- WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU,
GENTLEMEN?

1325
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,220
- I AM MATEEN.
THIS IS LUKE.

1326
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:29,190
- WELL, LET ME GUESS.
JOURNALISTS.

1327
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:33,070
- I'M TOM.
- ARE YOU WITH THE U.N.?

1328
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:34,210
- THAT'S RIGHT.

1329
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,110
- IS IT--IS IT POSSIBLE
I COULD TALK TO YOU?

1330
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,150
- I HOPE YOU BOYS LIKE MEAT.

1331
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:50,180
IN THIS COUNTRY, CHICKEN IS
CONSIDERED A VEGETABLE.

1332
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,230
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN
AFGHANISTAN, DR. HINKLEY?

1333
01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:00,060
- I HAVE DEDICATED MY LIFE TO
PEOPLE'S LAST MOMENTS

1334
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:01,140
ON THIS EARTH.

1335
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:04,100
THE DEAD AREN'T LIKE THE LIVING.

1336
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:05,170
THEY NEVER LIE.

1337
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:09,040
OF COURSE, THEY DON'T TALK
TOO MUCH EITHER,

1338
01:09:09,070 --> 01:09:11,200
BUT WHEN THEY DO,

1339
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:14,040
IT IS ALWAYS THE TRUTH.

1340
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:16,060
- WHAT DOES HE SAY?

1341
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:18,180
- SO THESE BODIES...

1342
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:21,080
I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR
SOME BODIES.

1343
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:23,010
- WELL, YOU HAVE COME TO
THE RIGHT PLACE.

1344
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,040
- IT'S MISSING A FINGER OR TWO.

1345
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:29,110
THEY WERE SHOT NEAR SHIRAC.

1346
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:32,050
- WARLORD SHARPSHOOTERS.
SPRING, FALL MAYBE.

1347
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,140
- THEY WERE SHOT BY SNIPERS.

1348
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:35,110
- COULD'VE BEEN FRED.

1349
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,090
- THERE'S A SNIPER NAMED FRED?

1350
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:39,100
[laughing]

1351
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:42,090
- HE KEEPS AN EYE ON THINGS

1352
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,120
LIKE MY OLD MAN.

1353
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:47,010
- YOUR OLD MAN?
- FRED.

1354
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,230
- WHAT IS FRED?

1355
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:53,040
- WAIT A MINUTE, SORRY, YOUR--
FRED IS YOUR OLD MAN'S NAME?

1356
01:09:53,070 --> 01:09:58,020
- WAS.
HE'S DEAD.

1357
01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:02,020
- HE WAS A GOOD GUY,
YOUR OLD MAN?

1358
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:03,110
- A QUIET MAN.

1359
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:05,000
ALWAYS WATCHING.

1360
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:08,060
ALWAYS WATCHING.

1361
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,220
VERY FINE.
THANK YOU.

1362
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:21,010
FIVE MEN SHOT NEAR SHIRAC.

1363
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,170
BURIED AT THE SITE.

1364
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,090
WE HAVEN'T DUG IT UP

I CAN'T TAKE CARE OF YOU, RIGHT?

1440
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:12,020
- NO, I DIDN'T GO OFF BY MYSELF.

1441
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:13,180
I WENT TO THAT NEXT VILLAGE.
I TOLD YOU.

1442
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:15,130
YOU NEVER CAME BACK FOR ME.

1443
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:18,200
- WHY DON'T WE JUST CALL IT
A LITTLE MISUNDERSTANDING?

1444
01:15:18,230 --> 01:15:20,210
I MEAN, YOU GOT SOME
GREAT SHOTS, DIDN'T YOU?

1445
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:32,030

01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,200
- YEAH, IT'S OKAY.

1448
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:38,090
OKAY.

1449
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,090
YOU JUST SIT HERE FOR A BIT,
ALL RIGHT?

1450
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:43,020
- YEAH.

1451
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:45,070

YOU KNOW?

1452
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:46,210
I THOUGHT I COULD COME HERE,
YOU KNOW.

1453
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,010
I THOUGHT I COULD HANDLE IT.
- YOU DID FINE.

1454
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:51,120
- NO, I DIDN'T.
- YOU DID FINE, TOM.

1455
01:15:51,150 --> 01:15:53,230

1457
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:02,080
COME HERE.
- I'M SORRY.

1458
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:03,210
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.

1459
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:17,110
- THIS IS FOR MILITARY
EMERGENCIES ONLY.

1460
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,080
- THIS IS A MILITARY EMERGENCY,
SO...

1461
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:21,070
WHAT THE SHIT?
YOU GOT GUMMY BEARS TOO?

1462
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:23,110
THANKS, BOSS.

1463
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:24,130
- DO YOU WANT ONE?

1464
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,130
- HEY, MOM.

1465
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:38,130
REALLY--IT'S REALLY GOOD
TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

1466
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,060
NO, WE'LL BE HOME IN
A COUPLE DAYS.

1467
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:47,180
- YOU HAVE SOMETHING ON
YOUR MIND, LUKE?

1468
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:58,060
- YOU'RE FRED.

1469
01:16:58,090 --> 01:17:02,000
- [chuckles]
WHAT?

1470
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:03,140
- YOU'RE FRED.

1471
01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:06,210
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHO'S FRED?

1472
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,220
- TELL HIM.

1473
01:17:10,030 --> 01:17:13,120
IMRAN, MEET FRED

NO, THERE'S NO WAY
HE'S THE FINGER GUY.

01:17:27,150 --> 01:17:29,190
RIGHT, YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING US
SINCE THE BEGINNING.

1481
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:33,210

01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,080
HOLY SHIT.

1483
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:37,080
HE'S MY STORY.
RICK, YOU PROMISED ME.

1484
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:39,050
- WHAT, HE'S NOT FUCKIN' YOURS.
- YOU PROMISED ME THIS STORY.

1485
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,180
- IT'S MY FUCKIN' STORY.
- LISTEN, FUCK YOU, LUKE!

1486
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:44,100
- OH, JESUS FUCKIN' CHRIST!

1487
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:46,090
NEITHER ONE OF YOU TWO FUCKIN'
IDIOTS CAN STOP TALKING ABOUT

1488
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:49,120
THIS FUCKIN' FINGER BULLSHIT,

1489
01:17:49,150 --> 01:17:51,010
[sighs]

1490
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:54,050
FUCK THIS.

1491
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:58,090
YOU WANT YOUR FUCKIN' FINGER,
IMRAN?

1492
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,230
THERE IT IS.
I CUT IT OFF.

1493
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:02,080
WAS KEEPING IT AROUND FOR LUCK.

1494
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:04,060
IT'S A FUCKIN' CURSE.

1495
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:05,190
SO YOU CAN HAVE IT, ALL RIGHT?
YOU FUCKIN' TAKE IT, HERE.

1496
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:07,040
YOU TAKE HIM BACK TO BASE,
GIVE IT TO HIM THEN.

1497
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:08,060
JUST GET HIM THE FUCK
OUT OF MY SIGHT.

1498
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:09,230
- WHAT?

1499
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:12,100
- THERE'S YOUR FUCKIN' EVIDENCE.
GET IN THE FUCKING JEEP!

1500
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:15,060
- THANK YOU.

1501
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:17,010
SORRY, BUDDY,
I GOT TO RUN WITH THIS.

1502
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:20,110
- WHAT THE FUCK, RICK?

1503
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:22,100
THAT IS MY GODDAMN STORY.

1504
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:25,230
- COME WITH ME.
- WHERE?

1505
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:27,120
- FUCKIN' SHIRAC.

1506
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:28,210
AND YOU, YOU'RE NOT
FUCKIN' GOING.

1507
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,050
YOU STAY HERE.
IT'S JUST HIM.

1508
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,150
- WE ARE FRIENDS.
I GO WITH HIM.

1509
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:33,010
- OH, YEAH?

1510
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:37,130
DO YOU MIND IF
I TAKE YOUR HORSE, FRIEND?

1511
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,230
- WHAT?

1512
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:40,140
- MATEEN, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1513
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:41,220
I'LL GO.

1514
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:46,050
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

1515
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:18,060
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING US?

1516
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:20,000
- TO FIND WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

1517
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:22,210
- AND WHAT'S THAT?
- FUCK, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME?

1518
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,150
- I WANTED TO SHOW WE COULD.
- COULD WHAT, LUKE?

1519
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:29,200
- COULD GO CRAZY.
- SHIT.

1520
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:31,180
WELL, SON, THAT'S WHAT WAR IS:
GOING CRAZY.

1521
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:33,060
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

1522
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:36,000
- I WANTED TO TELL THE PEOPLE
AT HOME THAT.

1523
01:19:36,030 --> 01:19:39,010
I WANTED TO SHOW THAT CANADIANS
COULD DO JUST THE WEIRDEST STUFF

1524
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,060
IN WAR AS ANYBODY ELSE.

1525
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:43,210
WE'RE NOT SANITIZED.

1526
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,120
WAR IS CRAZY,
AND WE'RE NO DIFFERENT.

1527
01:19:46,150 --> 01:19:49,140
CUTTING OFF A FINGER IS CRAZY.

1528
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:53,010
DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE ANYWAY.

1529
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,220
YOU GAVE IMRAN THE STORY.

1530
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:59,140
- I GAVE IMRAN A BAG WITH
A PIECE OF CANDY IN IT.

1531
01:19:59,170 --> 01:20:01,060
