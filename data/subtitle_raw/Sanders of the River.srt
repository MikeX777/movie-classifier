Tibbets.

29
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:57,850
<i>- Tibbets.</i>
- Oh, yes, sir.

30
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:00,580
What's the matter?
You feeling homesick?

31
00:04:00,688 --> 00:04:02,589
Oh, well. Never mind.

32
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,286
I felt exactly the same
during my first 10 days.

33
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:10,854
After your first 10 years,
you gradually begin to get used to it.

34
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:13,763
Is Hamilton not back yet?
He ought to have been here hours ago.

35
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:15,768
Do you think anything
could've happened to him, sir?

36
00:04:15,869 --> 00:04:18,065
Something can always happen
in this part of the world.

37
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:22,667
- Shall I take out a company and go search for him?
- No, no, no. Don't get so excited.

38
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:26,611
And for heaven's sake, stop thinking
about that Victoria Cross of yours.

39
00:04:26,714 --> 00:04:30,674
What you're in for is tramping
through swamps and jungles.

40
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:34,277
The only decoration you'll get
are mosquito bites.

41
00:04:34,388 --> 00:04:36,653
- You better go and see about dinner.
- Yes, sir.

42
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:41,088
Oh, hello, "Hamil."

43
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:43,096
- Good evening, sir.
- Glad to see you back.

44
00:04:43,197 --> 00:04:45,291
- Thanks very much.
- Come along. Come sit down.

45
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,368
- Thank you.
- Hot?

46
00:04:47,468 --> 00:04:49,630
- Oh, rather.
- Whiskey and soda?

47
00:04:49,737 --> 00:04:51,638
Oh, I'd love one.
Thanks very much.

48
00:04:52,673 --> 00:04:54,767
- You were all the way to the Isisis.
- Yeah.

49
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:58,710
- Anything happen?
- Well, I found a couple of gin bottles
in Kulubu's village.

50
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:01,338
When I told him you'd sent me
after his firewater...

51
00:05:01,448 --> 00:05:03,849
he said you've got ears
as long as an elephant...

52
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:08,218
eyes in the top of your head and
in your back, and where other men sit.

53
00:05:08,322 --> 00:05:11,087
<i>- I know.</i>
- That you were his father and mother...

54
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:13,456
but he wouldn't tell me
where he got his gin from.

55
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,654
Oh, that's simple.

56
00:05:15,763 --> 00:05:17,664
Our old friend Farini
up to his tricks again.

57
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:21,327
Oh, another thing. I picked up
a queer bird about a mile up the river.

58
00:05:21,435 --> 00:05:23,563
He came in an Ochori canoe.

59
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,299
- But he was not an Ochori.
- Oh.

60
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:30,036
I, uh-I took him on board
and tried to question him.

61
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:33,808
But all he would say is he had a high
and important matter to report to you...

62
00:05:33,914 --> 00:05:37,442
and to you only,
to the Lord Sandi.

63
00:05:37,551 --> 00:05:39,611
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, Tibbets.

64
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,179
Tell me, Hamilton.
Was this man tall?

65
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,782
<i>As a matter of fact, he's very tall.</i>

66
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:48,988
Very tall. I see.

67
00:05:49,096 --> 00:05:51,429
Abibu.

68
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:53,967
Take the tall man who came with
my lord Hamilton into my office.

69
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,535
Yes, my lord.

70
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:59,937
Sanders, your black children say
you've got all kinds of magic.

71
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,669
But you're not gonna tell me
out of the two million souls here...

72
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:04,745
you know the man
I picked up an hour ago.

73
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:07,144
I might. Come and have a look.

74
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:09,375
Right.

75
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,792
All right, Abibu.

76
00:06:33,674 --> 00:06:36,803
- Well?
- Lord, I am of the people of the Ochoris.

77
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,369
For three days have I come down the river
with strong oarsmen in my fast boat...

78
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,848
to tell you some very high
and important matter.

79
00:06:43,951 --> 00:06:47,513
- Who are you, man?
- I am Olaba, son of Zuburu.

80
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:52,582
- I sit in my father's place, and in my fast boat-
- Olaba, son of Zuburu?

81
00:06:52,693 --> 00:06:54,662
Yes, lord.

82
00:06:57,731 --> 00:07:01,224
- Is that not a lie, man?
- It is a lie, lord.

83
00:07:01,335 --> 00:07:03,770
It is a lie, man.

84
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:35,165
<i>Bosambo of Monrovia,
five months ago...</i>

85
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:37,170
<i>you made yourself
chief of the Ochoris.</i>

86
00:07:37,271 --> 00:07:40,969
<i>Didn’t you know that no man can be chief
in the river territories without my permission?</i>

87
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:44,101
- I knew, lord.
<i>- Well?</i>

88
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:47,409
But I also knew that you also knew
that I made myself chief of the Ochori.

89
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:50,109
You knew that I knew
because of my magic.

90
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:52,118
Lord, I knew that you knew
by your spies...

91
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:54,654
who are everywhere,
who are called the eyes of Your Lordship.

92
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:58,123
You thought I would like you so much that
I would confirm you as chief of the Ochoris.

93
00:07:58,225 --> 00:08:01,627
Lord, before I came, the Ochoris
were a great worry to Your Lordship.

94
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:04,527
They were just sheep at the mercy
of all the peoples of the river.

95
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:07,999
But I have taught all these peoples
a lesson and the Ochori to obey your law.

96
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:10,536
You know that every six months
I call on the Ochoris?

97
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:13,607
Yes, lord, at the time of the taxes.

98
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:18,805
Yes, Bosambo, at the time of the taxes,
in a month's time.

99
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:20,972
And you thought it
advisable to come sooner.

100
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:24,518
No, lord. I came to tell you about
a very high and important matter.

101
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:27,747
- Is that not a lie, Bosambo?
- Lord Sandi...

102
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:30,688
I lie to anybody
if I think it is good for me.

103
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,692
But I will never lie to you.

104
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:35,695
That will be very wise, Bosambo.

105
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:41,198
And what is this high and important matter
that you came to report to me?

106
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:43,964
Warriors came from
the Old King's Country.

107
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:51,141
- King Mofolaba's warriors?
<i>- Yes, lord. Under a captain of his guard.</i>

108
00:08:51,244 --> 00:08:53,907
They passed through the land of the Ochori
and went towards the country of the French.

109
00:08:54,014 --> 00:08:56,040
And you were afraid of them?

110
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:59,847
Lord Sandi, you rule
two million people along the river...

111
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:02,115
but there is only one man
who will not run away...

112
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:04,418
when he sees the ostrich feathers
of the old king's warriors.

113
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:06,425
And you are that one man?

114
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:08,825
I am the one man, lord.

115
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:12,263
- Then why didn't you stop them?
<i>- Lord, because I knew that would mean war.</i>

116
00:09:12,366 --> 00:09:14,562
And I also know that this,
Your Lordship does not want.

117
00:09:14,668 --> 00:09:16,864
That you know very wisely, Bosambo.

118
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,640
Well, your Monrovian friends
seem very anxious to see you again.

119
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:28,648
Shall I send you back to Monrovia?

120
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:31,218
Lord, everything is with God.

121
00:09:31,318 --> 00:09:33,947
- Are you a Mohammedan?
- Oh, no, Lord Sandi. I'm a Christian.

122
00:09:34,054 --> 00:09:35,955
Why, I went to a mission school.

123
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:38,992
I know all about the blessed
"Marki," "Luki" and "Johni."

124
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:42,551
And that other John who lost his head
about a certain dancing girl.

125
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:49,964
Bosambo, if I try you out for six months
as chief of the Ochori...

126
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,562
will you serve my king faithfully?

127
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:56,734
Yes, Lord Sandi. Every time I've seen
the beautiful face of your great king...

128
00:09:56,843 --> 00:09:59,574
- my heart has filled with joy.
- When have you seen his face?

129
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,580
Lord...

130
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:05,118
on little round pieces of silver.

131
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:07,914
- Tibbets.
- Yes, sir.

132
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:09,922
Have you got the chain
and medal of chieftainship?

133
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:12,458
Lord, it is here.

134
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:22,259
Old Zuburu's.
You wore this without permission.

135
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:25,533
Lord, I had to wear it
to keep the peace of your king.

136
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,235
Now, listen to me, Chief of the Ochoris.

137
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:34,712
You will report to me when
the old king's warriors come back.

138
00:10:34,815 --> 00:10:37,808
Let them pass if they do not attack
your people. You can write?

139
00:10:37,918 --> 00:10:39,546
- Yes, Lord Sandi.
- Good.

140
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:44,114
Now, in every village there is a pigeon house
with the pigeons of the government.

141
00:10:44,224 --> 00:10:48,184
Here we have a pigeon house
with the pigeons of every nation.

142
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:51,424
- What are you grinning at?
- Lord, the Ochori pigeons here...

143
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:54,160
are so old and fat that
they cannot fly anymore.

144
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:57,635
I brought four strong Ochori pigeons
and gave them to your sergeant, Abibu.

145
00:10:57,737 --> 00:11:00,172
That is good.

146
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:06,269
Now go back to your people, Chief.
The palaver is finished.

147
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,148
Lord Sandi, I am your servant.

148
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:29,095
I don't like this news about
the old king's warriors.

149
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:32,536
They passed through Ochori
territory three days ago.

150
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,767
They'll be in the Congo by now.

151
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:18,903
Look at that.

152
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:29,917
- You think this means serious trouble?
- Maybe.

153
00:13:30,023 --> 00:13:33,323
- Half a company, Sanders, and two machine guns?
- Yes, starting at once, please.

154
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:35,657
Embark half company, Tibbets.
Jump to it.

155
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:39,462
You can't possibly get there
in time to stop the slavers.

156
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:41,467
I know I can't.

157
00:13:41,568 --> 00:13:44,629
I'm sending a pigeon to the new
chief of the Ochoris to head them off.

158
00:13:44,738 --> 00:13:47,037
What chance has he got
against Mofolaba's spears?

159
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,009
Well, if it comes to that,
we haven't got much chance either.

160
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:53,012
- Abibu.
- Yes, lord.

161
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:55,582
Send this message
by one of the new Ochori pigeons.

162
00:13:55,682 --> 00:13:57,708
Yes, my lord.

163
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:07,510
The war drums.

164
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:01,632
♪ On, on, into battle ♪

165
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:03,642

I stop you in the name of Lord Sandi...

189
00:18:00,627 --> 00:18:02,789
who is not pleased
when slaves are taken.

190
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:05,331
Stop me?

191
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:08,458
I'm the captain of the great king.

192
00:18:08,568 --> 00:18:11,128
<i>Nobody dares to stop me.</i>

193
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:15,538
Lord Sandi says,
"Keep men and women till I come."

194
00:18:15,642 --> 00:18:21,104
You turn and march in front of me
until you reach my city.

195
00:18:23,316 --> 00:18:25,444
Go.

196
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:16,732
- What's your name, girl?
- Lilongo.

197
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:18,805
Lilongo.

198
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,509
Lilongo.

199
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:27,169
It's like the sound of little streams
running over the stone.

200
00:19:28,615 --> 00:19:30,607
Lilongo.

201
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:34,746
- Where do you come from?
- You wouldn't know the place.

202
00:19:34,854 --> 00:19:37,915
- I'm from the coast.
- I know all about the coast.

203
00:19:39,092 --> 00:19:42,187
We will talk about that later.

204
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:46,665
Now I have very high and
important matters to deal with...

205
00:19:46,766 --> 00:19:48,667
Lilongo.

206
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:18,855
- Achmed, lord.
- Fine, show him in.

207
00:20:18,965 --> 00:20:21,025
Achmed.

208
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:26,970
Achmed, did you deliver
my message to King Mofolaba?

209
00:20:27,073 --> 00:20:31,204
Yes, lord. I told him that you called him to
palaver on the field in front of the pass.

210
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,245
- What did he say?
- He was very angry.

211
00:20:33,346 --> 00:20:37,511
- But he's afraid of you, so I still live.
- Well, I'm very glad of it.

212
00:20:37,617 --> 00:20:40,086
You better get some rest.

213
00:20:40,186 --> 00:20:42,417
Your servant, Lord Sandi.

214
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:54,927
Here they come, Lord Sandi.

215
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:06,437
Set them at ease.

216
00:21:53,793 --> 00:21:58,163
King Mofolaba, I called you to palaver,
but I didn't call your warriors.

217
00:21:58,264 --> 00:22:01,996
Lord Sandi, a dog of a little chief
chopped a captain of my guard.

218
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:04,798
Your captain heard my orders,
but he didn't obey them.

219
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:08,068
Lord Sandi, you promised
we should keep our custom.

220
00:22:08,174 --> 00:22:11,008
It's an old custom
in our lands to buy women.

221
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,909
Yes, if the woman and the father consent.

222
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:16,448
But slavery I will not have,
King Mofolaba.

223
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:20,782
My fathers ruled these lands
for 300 years.

224
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:24,722
- I am the greatest king in these countries.
- My king is the greatest king on earth.

225
00:22:24,824 --> 00:22:28,659
<i>And if little kings and chiefs
disobey his orders...</i>

226
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:30,662
I plow them into the ground.

227
00:22:36,002 --> 00:22:38,403
What do you want, Sandi?

228
00:22:38,504 --> 00:22:41,531
You will take your spears
back to your own country.

229
00:22:41,641 --> 00:22:43,542
And for the blood of your captain...

230
00:22:43,643 --> 00:22:45,805
I will send back your warriors
who are in my prison.

231
00:22:45,912 --> 00:22:50,373
I will do as you want, my Sandi,
because I am your friend.

232
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:54,579
But I have nine war drums
over which I stretched the skin...

233
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:58,089
of little chiefs who offended me.

234
00:22:58,191 --> 00:23:01,821
I know the skin that will be
stretched on the 10th.

235
00:23:04,497 --> 00:23:07,092
If you touch one servant
of the government...

236
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,601
be it so little as a pigeon...

237
00:23:09,702 --> 00:23:12,695
then believe me, King Mofolaba,
you won't be king any longer.

238
00:23:14,674 --> 00:23:16,438
The palaver is finished.

239
00:23:39,065 --> 00:23:41,694
I'd be delighted to break his neck.

240
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:43,770
The British taxpayer
wouldn't be delighted.

241
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,669
- Why, sir?
- It's cost them about a million pounds.

242
00:23:46,772 --> 00:23:49,071
War is an expensive thing.

243
00:23:49,175 --> 00:23:51,144
Now we've got these girls to worry about.

244
00:23:51,244 --> 00:23:55,045
Commission waiting for them. You better
take 10 men and get them over the border.

245
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:57,207
Yes, sir.

246
00:24:08,194 --> 00:24:11,824
- Well, what's the trouble?
- Sorry, sir, but I just can't manage these girls.

247
00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:15,060
- Why?
- You should hear the things they say...

248
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:17,227
especially about Bosambo.

249
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:21,964
Here. Come along.

250
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:26,944
Come outside, girls.
Come on, all of you.

251
00:24:27,046 --> 00:24:29,880
Come on. Outside.

252
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:37,249
Shh, shh.
Now then.

253
00:24:38,424 --> 00:24:41,690
<i>- Has anybody hurt you since you’ve been here?
- No, lord.</i>

254
00:24:41,794 --> 00:24:44,161
Don't you want to go back
to your fathers and your mothers?

255
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:47,199
<i>- No, lord.</i>
- Then what do you want?

256
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,633
To marry the chief.

257
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:54,807
- What? All 10 of you?
- Yes, lord.

258
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:57,536
<i>- He's a great chief.
- He can build 10 huts.</i>

259
00:24:57,643 --> 00:24:59,942
<i>He is great enough for 10 wives.</i>

260
00:25:00,046 --> 00:25:03,016
But don't you know that he has
five wives already in another village?

261
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:06,745
<i>- No, lord.</i>
- Well, they're old and fierce.

262
00:25:06,852 --> 00:25:09,321
- Wouldn't they beat you?
<i>- They would, lord.</i>

263
00:25:09,422 --> 00:25:12,654
- Wouldn't they make you carry wood and water?
<i>- Yes, lord.</i>

264
00:25:12,758 --> 00:25:15,057
Yes, well, you go back to your fathers
and your mothers.

265
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:18,461
If you obey my lord Tibbets here,
no one will harm you.

266
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:20,465
<i>Yes, lord.</i>

267
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:23,365
- There ought to be 10.
- Where's the 10th girl?

268
00:25:23,469 --> 00:25:26,667
She has gone to the chief's house
to look through the magic glass.

269
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:28,673
How do you know?

270
00:25:28,774 --> 00:25:32,643
First day, I went to chief's house
and looked through the magic glass.

271
00:25:32,745 --> 00:25:35,977
<i>Second day, I went to the chief's
house and looked through the magic glass.</i>

272
00:25:36,082 --> 00:25:39,018
<i>- The third day, I went-</i>
- Now, that'll do.

273
00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:42,886
All right. Carry on, Tibbets.

274
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:49,318
How dare you!
Get out of here!

275
00:26:12,952 --> 00:26:15,421
- What is your name, girl?
- Lilongo, lord.

276
00:26:15,521 --> 00:26:18,548
Well, Lilongo, you must go back
to your father and your mother.

277
00:26:18,657 --> 00:26:22,458
The chief here has already
five wives in another village...

278
00:26:22,561 --> 00:26:25,121
that are old and fierce.

279
00:26:25,231 --> 00:26:27,291
Lord, I know he has no wives...

280
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,926
because he always wanted
other men's wives.

281
00:26:30,036 --> 00:26:33,996
But now he's even ready to swear
an oath that if I marry him...

282
00:26:34,106 --> 00:26:36,007
he won't have other wives.

283
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:38,703
But I won't listen to him
until those girls leave this city.

284
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:42,111
- Lilongo, they're just leaving.
- Don't you marry him, Lilongo.

285
00:26:42,214 --> 00:26:45,480
- Lord, there is a saying in our country.
- What is it?

286
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:48,782
A lover has strong arms, but no brains.

287
00:26:49,989 --> 00:26:52,481
Well, that is also true
of other countries.

288
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:56,585
But if I find a man with
the strongest arms and great brains...

289
00:26:56,695 --> 00:27:00,427
- why shouldn't I marry him?
- Do you think you can hold him?

290
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:03,766
Oh, well.
I suppose I can't object.

291
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:06,737
Lilongo, if you marry me,
no other wife will ever come into my hut.

292
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,740
Well, I'll take care of that...

293
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:10,901
- but I am a Mohammedan.
- Well, so am I.

294
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,639
- What?
- They said you were a Christian.

295
00:27:16,315 --> 00:27:18,875
I'm a Christian for Lord Sandi.

296
00:27:18,984 --> 00:27:21,453
But for you,
I shall be of the true faith.

297
00:27:21,554 --> 00:27:25,184
Well, you better make up your mind about it.
I've got other things to think about.

298
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:06,361
Well, Lilongo.

299
00:28:06,465 --> 00:28:08,900
Here's that paper
you've been worrying about.

300
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:12,961
- Thank you, lord.
- That shows that you and Bosambo are married.

301
00:28:13,072 --> 00:28:16,531
You understand, Bosambo?
One paper, one wife.

302
00:28:16,642 --> 00:28:20,010
- Yes, Lord Sandi.
- Do you feel everything's all right now?

303
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:24,049
Lord, in my father's house
I couldn't have had such great honor.

304
00:31:14,153 --> 00:31:16,088
Take your shield.

00:33:33,325 --> 00:33:36,454
So you're teaching him
the killing dance again.

333
00:33:36,562 --> 00:33:40,260
One day the old king will swoop down on
this country and there will be a great killing.

334
00:33:40,365 --> 00:33:42,994
I don't want my son
to kill or to be killed.

335
00:33:43,101 --> 00:33:45,661
You have enough money from
the government to live anywhere.

336
00:33:45,771 --> 00:33:48,036
The coast, somewhere out of danger.

337
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,371
I won't stay.

338
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:00,619
Lilongo, light of my life.

339
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:03,279
It shall be as you want.

340
00:34:06,492 --> 00:34:09,052
I'll have to talk to Lord Sandi, of course.

341
00:34:09,161 --> 00:34:12,359
Tell him that our son
can't go into their new school.

342
00:34:12,464 --> 00:34:14,365
Why can't he?

343
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:17,493
The government's building
the school for chiefs' sons.

344
00:34:17,603 --> 00:34:21,233
We live at the coast, I won't be a chief,
he won't be a chief's son.

345
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:23,741
Therefore, he can't go
in the new school.

346
00:34:25,944 --> 00:34:28,812
You know I don't want
to fight the old king.

347
00:34:29,882 --> 00:34:32,147
Let's get out of his way.

348
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:38,150
You know, one day the old king
will attack the English.

349
00:34:38,257 --> 00:34:40,954
And they will eat him up.

350
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:44,393
Then they'll look for someone
to rule all these countries for them.

351
00:34:45,931 --> 00:34:50,869
On that day, your son
might have been a great king.

352
00:34:52,738 --> 00:34:55,537
Of course, we'll then be living
peacefully at the coast.

353
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,276
You know we shan't.

354
00:34:59,378 --> 00:35:03,839
You're full of cunning,
and you do just as you like with me.

355
00:35:20,098 --> 00:35:22,329
Well, there you are, Ferguson.

356
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:24,335
That's the whole show.

357
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:26,905
It's all very well, stepping
into your shoes, Sanders.

358
00:35:27,005 --> 00:35:30,134
- You know how I feel about it, don't you?
- Yes. Rotten.

359
00:35:30,242 --> 00:35:33,440
- Rotten.
- I know exactly how you feel.

360
00:35:33,545 --> 00:35:36,845
When I first came here, I thought
I never would get the hang of it.

361
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:38,941
One does, somehow.

362
00:35:39,051 --> 00:35:41,179
By working hard
and losing one's illusions.

363
00:35:41,286 --> 00:35:45,587
Oh, I don't know. I never had
many illusions about human nature.

364
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:48,126
- And the work isn't entirely wasted.
- Oh, no, of course not.

365
00:35:48,226 --> 00:35:51,025
Do you know that 10 years ago
when we went upstream...

366
00:35:51,129 --> 00:35:53,598
we couldn't stay
on the deck of the ship?

367
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:57,500
When we got near the shore,
a shower of arrows poured on us.

368
00:35:57,603 --> 00:35:59,663
All over the territory,
the same thing.

369
00:35:59,771 --> 00:36:02,400
War, killing, torture.

370
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:04,976
No woman dared leave her village.

371
00:36:05,077 --> 00:36:07,706
And no man could sleep
safely in his hut.

372
00:36:07,813 --> 00:36:11,614
And yet, crossing the territory now
is just as safe as crossing London town.

373
00:36:11,717 --> 00:36:14,346
Oh, much safer. No traffic.

374
00:36:14,453 --> 00:36:16,422
- Got a match?
- Yeah, I do.

375
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:20,014
All the same, I'd watch
the Old King's Country if I were you.

376
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:23,926
- Are you expecting trouble from there?
- One can always expect trouble.

377
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:27,158
I think the best thing to do
would be to call him to palaver.

378
00:36:27,265 --> 00:36:29,894
And then show as much force
as you can muster.

379
00:36:30,002 --> 00:36:32,096
Surely, that's asking for trouble, isn't it?

380
00:36:32,204 --> 00:36:35,504
Personally, I prefer to see
the other kings and chiefs first.

381
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:39,066
Well, it's your show from now on.

382
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:41,078
I'll call them together for you.

383
00:36:44,016 --> 00:36:48,477
Kings and chiefs,
there is peace in the land.

384
00:36:48,587 --> 00:36:52,251
And no man's hand
is raised against his brother.

385
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:55,259
Thus it has been for 50 moons.

386
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,263
And behold, you grow
rich and-and fat.

387
00:36:59,364 --> 00:37:01,265
Yes, Lord Sandi.

388
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:03,198
Lord, it is true.

389
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:08,069
My people are so rich that even
the common man can afford three wives.

390
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:13,373
I've called you here today
because I go on a long journey...

391
00:37:13,478 --> 00:37:15,777
over the great seas.

392
00:37:15,881 --> 00:37:18,441
And there shall I stay for 12 moons.

393
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:22,954
Lord Sandi, it fills our hearts with sorrow
to see you go away from us.

394
00:37:23,055 --> 00:37:26,423
- Yes, Lord Sandi.
- Thank you, Bosambo.

395
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:29,552
And in my place,
the Lord Ferguson shall stay here...

396
00:37:29,661 --> 00:37:33,962
and give the law
to all the peoples of the river.

397
00:37:34,066 --> 00:37:36,695
I want you to obey him...

398
00:37:36,802 --> 00:37:39,772
as if you were his own children.

399
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:46,038
And that you keep the king's peace...

400
00:37:46,144 --> 00:37:50,047
lest a great shame
come upon me before my king.

401
00:37:50,148 --> 00:37:52,174
What do you say, Kulubu?

402
00:37:52,284 --> 00:37:55,083
Lord, war is very terrible.

403
00:37:55,187 --> 00:37:59,591
But if one madman comes against
five other men who are not mad...

404
00:37:59,691 --> 00:38:03,321
behold, they all become mad together.

405
00:38:03,428 --> 00:38:06,262
Those are words of wisdom, Kulubu.

406
00:38:07,632 --> 00:38:11,262
- And you, Chalo?
- Lord, we all love one another now.

407
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:15,670
Because if we did not, Your Lordship
would punish us very cruelly.

408
00:38:15,774 --> 00:38:18,744
That also is very wise, Chalo.

409
00:38:18,844 --> 00:38:20,904
<i>And now, my kings and chiefs...</i>

410
00:38:21,012 --> 00:38:23,004
the big ship is waiting.

411
00:38:23,115 --> 00:38:26,051
I leave you with sorrow in my heart.

412
00:38:26,151 --> 00:38:28,052
The palaver is finished.

413
00:38:28,153 --> 00:38:31,453
Go in peace, Lord Sandi.

414
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:43,000
Well, good-bye, Bosambo.

415
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:46,902
You will be loved by Lord Ferguson
just as you've been loved by me.

416
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:50,464
Lord Sandi, you've been father
and mother to the peoples of the river.

417
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:53,636
Well, in a year's time, I shall come back.

418
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:56,681
And everything will be
just the same as it was before.

419
00:38:56,782 --> 00:38:59,047
Remember me, Lord Sandi.

420
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:03,782
I'll remember you.
Always, Bosambo.

421
00:39:23,308 --> 00:39:25,903
- By tomorrow, we'll be in the Old King's Country.
- Good.

422
00:39:26,011 --> 00:39:30,676
I'll build a still that will produce enough
alcohol to make the whole of Africa drunk.

423
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:36,914
Do you realize why after five years...

424
00:39:37,022 --> 00:39:40,584
the iron Mr. Sanders
just went on leave now?

425
00:39:40,692 --> 00:39:43,161
- Why?
- He fell in love.

426
00:39:43,261 --> 00:39:45,958
With Captain Hamilton's sister...

427
00:39:46,064 --> 00:39:48,431
while she was down here
six months ago.

428
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:51,594
It would give me
considerable pleasure...

429
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:54,605
to teach his black children
a thing or two...

430
00:39:54,706 --> 00:39:56,834
while he's cooing
and billing in London.

431
00:39:56,942 --> 00:39:59,275
His black children have
become pretty civilized.

432
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:03,439
- I have a great magic to stop all that.
<i>- What's that?</i>

433
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:06,985
Sandi.

434
00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:09,884
Sandi's dead.

435
00:40:09,988 --> 00:40:13,288
There's no law anymore.

436
00:42:39,504 --> 00:42:42,064
Again and again and again.

437
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:44,074
What is it now, Hamilton?

438
00:42:44,175 --> 00:42:46,371
Oh, it's always the same.

439
00:42:46,478 --> 00:42:50,313
♪♪"Sandi. Sandi.

440
00:42:50,415 --> 00:42:53,351
Sandi is dead.
There's no law anymore."

441
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:57,081
Oh, it's maddening.
Any more messages from pigeons?

442
00:42:57,188 --> 00:42:59,987
Can't expect any more
pigeons before morning, sir.

443
00:43:00,091 --> 00:43:02,219
It's pitch dark now already.

444
00:43:02,327 --> 00:43:05,263
<i>- Halt! Who goes there?
- I want to see Lord Ferguson.</i>

445
00:43:05,363 --> 00:43:07,992
<i>This way, Father.</i>

446
00:43:10,935 --> 00:43:13,837
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- It's Father O'Leary from the Akasavas.

447
00:43:13,938 --> 00:43:17,375
- Good evening, Mr. Ferguson.
- Good evening, Father. What happened?

448
00:43:17,475 --> 00:43:20,138
They've fired my church.

449
00:43:20,245 --> 00:43:22,976
They've fired the Baptist church
at Isisi too.

450
00:43:23,081 --> 00:43:26,108
Mr. and Mrs. Jackson
have fled to Mr. Lowe's camp.

451
00:43:26,217 --> 00:43:28,118
They might attack them as well.

452
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:32,179
- Just like wild beasts.
- No, Mr. Ferguson, they are not.

453
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,124
- They might have killed you too.
- That is not why I came.

454
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:37,127
I have no fear for my own life.

455
00:43:37,228 --> 00:43:42,292
I came to tell you that those two white men
are selling them gin and firearms.

456
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,304
You must be quick and strong now
like a father with his misguided children.

457
00:43:48,506 --> 00:43:50,907
Like Mr. Sanders would.

458
00:43:51,009 --> 00:43:55,811
Or else, much, much blood
will flow very soon.

459
00:44:11,129 --> 00:44:13,894
Sanders's life's work destroyed in a week.

460
00:44:19,737 --> 00:44:22,263
Hamilton,
you will stay here as my deputy.

461
00:44:22,373 --> 00:44:25,104
I shall wire the governor,
telling him the situation.

462
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:29,204
Tibbets, you will embark a half a company
and come upstream with me.

463
00:44:29,314 --> 00:44:31,306
You will disembark at the Isisi city.

464
00:44:32,717 --> 00:44:34,652
I shall take 10 men...

465
00:44:34,752 --> 00:44:37,688
and go on to the Old King's Country,
the seat of the trouble.

466
00:44:37,789 --> 00:44:40,418
- Ferguson, you can't do that!
- Wouldn't Sanders have gone?

467
00:44:40,525 --> 00:44:43,222
- Why, I don't know.
- I do. He would.

468
00:44:43,328 --> 00:44:46,389
- Ferguson, listen to me.
- Captain Hamilton, you have your orders.

469
00:44:46,498 --> 00:44:48,592
- Tibbets, parade your men.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

470
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:14,857
So sorry to interrupt your dance, Sanders.
This is very serious.

471
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:18,794
- Do you know a man named Farini?
- Oh, yes. He's a gunrunner.

472
00:45:18,897 --> 00:45:21,765
Ten years ago,
I sent him down here in irons.

473
00:45:21,866 --> 00:45:25,826
Five years ago, he crossed over my territory,
but he slipped over to the Portuguese.

474
00:45:25,937 --> 00:45:29,465
Well, he's back again.
In the Old King's Country.

475
00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:32,744
- Gin and firearms?
- Yes.

476
00:45:32,844 --> 00:45:35,336
- Oh, that's bad.
- Yes.

477
00:45:35,446 --> 00:45:37,608
The whole territory's aflame.

478
00:45:37,715 --> 00:45:40,981
Father O'Leary, who knows something
about it, sums it up like this:

479
00:45:41,085 --> 00:45:44,988
"Please send four battalions or Sanders."

480
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:49,652
Well, Sir John, I'm afraid in this case
it'll have to be the four battalions.

481
00:45:49,761 --> 00:45:52,094
As you know, I'm on 12 months leave.

482
00:45:52,197 --> 00:45:55,031
I'm going home to get married.

483
00:45:55,133 --> 00:45:57,102
Anyway, I shall be too late.

484
00:45:57,202 --> 00:46:00,798
- I'll let you have an airplane.
- I'm sorry, Sir John.

485
00:46:00,905 --> 00:46:02,897
It wouldn't be fair to my fiancée.

486
00:46:04,943 --> 00:46:08,846
- She's, uh, Hamilton's sister, isn't she?
- Yes, sir.

487
00:46:08,947 --> 00:46:12,748
Well, the last report
of Hamilton was safe and sound.

488
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:15,979
- What about the rest?
- Well, Tibbets went to the Isisi.

489
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:19,182
But they're out of hand.
He's lost half a dozen men.

490
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,691
Ferguson went over the mountains.

491
00:46:22,794 --> 00:46:25,764
- What? To the Old King's Country?
- Yes.

492
00:46:25,863 --> 00:46:27,832
What happened to him?

493
00:46:30,101 --> 00:46:32,070
There's no news.

494
00:47:22,453 --> 00:47:26,788
Ferguson, you came with your soldiers
against me. You shall die!

495
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:29,622
You shall live one day
and then another day, Mofolaba...

496
00:47:29,727 --> 00:47:31,719
and then Sandi will come in my place...

497
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:33,798
and he will kill you.

498
00:47:35,266 --> 00:47:38,236
- Sandi's dead.
- You're afraid, Mofolaba, because you know him.

499
00:47:38,336 --> 00:47:41,704
But he will come.
Sandi, the eater of kings.

500
00:47:41,806 --> 00:47:43,707
- Sandi's dead!
- No, he's not.

501
00:47:43,808 --> 00:47:48,178
I tell you. He will come. And wherever
you may hide, he will smell you out...

502
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:50,214
<i>and throw your body to the fishes!</i>

503
00:48:21,546 --> 00:48:23,538
I, uh-

504
00:48:23,648 --> 00:48:25,617
I'm getting out.

505
00:48:27,018 --> 00:48:31,183
- What the hell do you mean?
- You heard what I said. I'm getting out.

506
00:48:31,289 --> 00:48:33,520
You confounded fool!

507
00:48:33,624 --> 00:48:36,560
If the old man sees us on the run,
he'll know we were lying.

508
00:48:36,661 --> 00:48:40,120
We wouldn't have a chance in a million.

509
00:48:40,231 --> 00:48:42,029
We killed Ferguson.

510
00:48:42,133 --> 00:48:45,570
You cold-blooded swine.

511
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:50,938
White men, lord king calls you.

512
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:01,078
You pull yourself together.

513
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:15,432
<i>This man lied in telling me...</i>

514
00:49:15,533 --> 00:49:18,162
that Sandi will come back.

515
00:49:18,269 --> 00:49:20,738
Can Sandi come back?

516
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:23,307
He can't come back,
because he's dead.

517
00:49:23,408 --> 00:49:26,242
Your voice is beautiful to me
when you say that.

518
00:49:26,344 --> 00:49:30,782
But if a devil is in your heart
and you have spoken lies...

519
00:49:30,882 --> 00:49:34,944
then, white man,
my skinning men shall know your voice.

520
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:39,820
- I tell you he's dead!
- Then I'll send down my fighting regiment...

521
00:49:39,924 --> 00:49:42,587
to bring me back the skin of a little chief.

522
00:55:37,548 --> 00:55:39,915
Ah, Bosambo.

523
00:55:40,017 --> 00:55:42,782
What did you hear about
the death of my lord Ferguson?

524
00:55:42,887 --> 00:55:46,790
Lord, he died like a brave man...

525
00:55:46,891 --> 00:55:48,860
at the hands of King Mofolaba.

526
00:55:48,959 --> 00:55:51,224
- He wasn't tortured.
<i>- No, lord. Very quick death.</i>

527
00:55:51,328 --> 00:55:53,524
Oh, thank heaven for that.

528
00:55:53,631 --> 00:55:58,194
Well, we must smash the old king's army
before he joins up with the Isisi and the Akasavas.

529
00:55:58,302 --> 00:56:02,262
Then, believe me,
all chiefs will come to palaver.

530
00:56:05,042 --> 00:56:07,011
Hello.

531
00:56:08,078 --> 00:56:10,980
- What's that?
- My Ochori men, lord...

532
00:56:11,081 --> 00:56:12,982
sending messages everywhere saying...

533
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:16,815
"Sandi is not dead.
The law is back on the river."

534
00:56:57,628 --> 00:57:00,097
Sandi.

535
00:57:00,197 --> 00:57:01,722
Sandi's not dead.

536
00:57:03,033 --> 00:57:05,400
Bring the white man here.

537
00:57:13,744 --> 00:57:17,078
Listen. What's that?

538
00:57:17,181 --> 00:57:19,173
Well, I -I don't know.

539
00:57:23,754 --> 00:57:26,883
- Sandi the Tiger, on the river.
- What do you say?

540
00:57:26,991 --> 00:57:30,120
- It isn't true. Sandi is dead.
- Sandi.

541
00:57:32,496 --> 00:57:34,658
Smashed the army of the great king.

542
00:57:40,871 --> 00:57:43,636
Take him away!

543
00:57:50,014 --> 00:57:52,347
Oh! Oh!

544
00:57:52,449 --> 00:57:55,317
Get 'em off!

545
00:58:29,286 --> 00:58:32,450
Sandi won't come here
till after the rain.

546
00:58:33,524 --> 00:58:36,494
When he does come and he asks...

547
00:58:36,593 --> 00:58:39,654
"Who chopped Ferguson?"
what will your answer be?

548
00:58:39,763 --> 00:58:42,392
White men, Farini and Smith,
chopped Ferguson.

549
00:59:00,184 --> 00:59:02,585
All people listen.

550
00:59:02,686 --> 00:59:06,987
White men, Farini and Smith,
chopped Ferguson.

551
00:59:07,091 --> 00:59:09,720
Who chopped Ferguson?

552
00:59:09,827 --> 00:59:13,264
The white men, Farini and Smith,
chopped Ferguson.

553
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:19,535
It is easy to lie to the English.

554
00:59:20,571 --> 00:59:22,472
They want peace.

555
00:59:22,573 --> 00:59:25,509
If you say you want peace,
they will believe you.

556
00:59:26,577 --> 00:59:28,910
I can make peace with the English.

557
00:59:29,013 --> 00:59:32,711
But don't we lose our honor if we don't
finish with the chief of the Ochoris?

558
00:59:32,816 --> 00:59:35,081
Lord, how can we catch him?

559
00:59:35,185 --> 00:59:37,950
How would you catch a leopard?

560
00:59:38,055 --> 00:59:41,025
You get the right bait,
he walks into your trap.

561
00:59:48,665 --> 00:59:50,634
Makara.

562
00:59:52,136 --> 00:59:53,934
<i>Makara...</i>

563
00:59:54,038 --> 00:59:56,906
I am hot for the hide
of a certain leopard.

564
00:59:57,007 --> 00:59:59,238
Go and get the bait...

565
00:59:59,343 --> 01:00:02,802
that will bring the leopard
into my trap.

My lord Sandi holds palaver
with them on his ship.

593
01:04:47,531 --> 01:04:50,000
All right.

594
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:52,262
Now, 10 days ago, when I left you...

595
01:04:52,369 --> 01:04:55,931
your words were sweeter
than the honey of wild bees.

596
01:04:56,039 --> 01:05:00,443
<i>But... what is the truth? This:</i>

597
01:05:00,544 --> 01:05:04,948
I had hardly reached the house of the man
who is above me in the service of my king...

598
01:05:05,048 --> 01:05:08,951
and I hear this: that the N'Gombi,
the Isisi and the Akasavas...

599
01:05:09,052 --> 01:05:11,078
are dancing the blood dance.

600
01:05:11,188 --> 01:05:15,091
Killing, murdering, stealing.

601
01:05:15,192 --> 01:05:18,390
Do I hear right?
Answer me, Kulubu.

602
01:05:18,495 --> 01:05:21,090
Lord, your ears as long as an elephant.

603
01:05:21,198 --> 01:05:24,066
My young men heard
that Your Lordship was dead...

604
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:26,363
and their hearts were filled
with a great joy.

605
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:29,269
- Well, now they know that I'm alive.
- Yes, lord...

606
01:05:29,373 --> 01:05:32,002
and their hearts are filled with sorrow.

607
01:05:32,109 --> 01:05:34,840
You have brought
great shame upon me before my king...

608
01:05:35,912 --> 01:05:37,904
and I will punish
with great punishment...

609
01:05:38,014 --> 01:05:40,506
all those who break the law.

610
01:05:40,617 --> 01:05:44,076
This I have done with the N'Gombi,
and this also I will do with the Isisi...

611
01:05:44,187 --> 01:05:46,452
and with all who break
the peace of my king.

612
01:05:46,556 --> 01:05:48,525
The palaver is finished.

613
01:05:58,935 --> 01:06:01,404
Bosambo, you're a very brave man.

614
01:06:01,505 --> 01:06:04,669
You have made the Ochoris
the bravest people in the river...

615
01:06:04,775 --> 01:06:06,744
and helped me punish the others.

616
01:06:06,843 --> 01:06:10,302
- You have been my friend.
- Thank you, Lord Sandi.

617
01:06:10,414 --> 01:06:12,383
How's your wife?

618
01:06:12,482 --> 01:06:15,247
Lord, she's a pleasant sight...

619
01:06:15,352 --> 01:06:17,412
and a great cook.

620
01:06:17,521 --> 01:06:21,652
- A miracle.
- And my son grows straight, like a palm tree.

621
01:06:21,758 --> 01:06:24,227
And my little one, like this.

622
01:06:25,262 --> 01:06:27,197
That's splendid.

623
01:06:27,297 --> 01:06:31,632
- Lord Sandi, you too soon will marry.
- Yes, I hope so, Bosambo.

624
01:06:31,735 --> 01:06:33,704
She also is a pleasant sight.

625
01:06:33,804 --> 01:06:37,502
May she become a great cook
and bear you many tall sons.

626
01:06:37,607 --> 01:06:39,576
Thank you, Bosambo.

627
01:06:39,676 --> 01:06:42,339
In the spring,
I'll return with four battalions...

628
01:06:42,446 --> 01:06:44,711
and punish King Mofolaba.

629
01:06:44,815 --> 01:06:46,943
You can take your warriors home now.

630
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:49,019
Yes, Lord Sandi.

631
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:55,024
Lord "Tibbeti," may you also have
many wives and many children.

632
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:58,357
Oh, thank you, Bosambo.

633
01:06:58,462 --> 01:07:00,761
Oh, dear.

634
01:07:00,864 --> 01:07:03,163
Hello, sir?

635
01:07:03,266 --> 01:07:05,895
- Fever coming on?
- Yes, I'm afraid so.

636
01:07:06,002 --> 01:07:09,404
- I had a touch of it all day.
- You'd better get to bed.

637
01:07:09,506 --> 01:07:11,907
Yes, I think I will.

638
01:07:12,008 --> 01:07:16,139
If it gets very bad,
keep in midstream till I'm better.

639
01:07:16,246 --> 01:07:19,273
- Then we'll go up and deal with the Isisi.
- Yes, sir.

669
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:25,527
Lord Tibbets,
shall I stop the engine at the Isisi?

670
01:11:25,628 --> 01:11:28,826
Man, you stop your engine
when you get your order.

671
01:11:28,932 --> 01:11:32,699
The order is we stay in midstream
as long as my lord Sandi is ill with malaria.

672
01:11:32,802 --> 01:11:34,771
- But, lord-
- You go now...

673
01:11:34,871 --> 01:11:37,739
and if you ask me again,
my arm will go mad!

674
01:11:37,841 --> 01:11:39,810
Next case, please.

675
01:11:42,312 --> 01:11:44,713
Ears as-elephant.

676
01:11:45,915 --> 01:11:50,410

<i>No.</i>

678
01:11:59,929 --> 01:12:02,865
Oh, get out, Tibbets!

679
01:12:02,966 --> 01:12:05,492
If I went-want anything, I'll knock.

680
01:12:10,039 --> 01:12:11,871
Topolaka...

681
01:12:11,975 --> 01:12:16,675
<i>is it no longer the custom for the women
of the Ochori to greet their returning warriors?</i>

682
01:12:22,152 --> 01:12:24,781
Lilongo.

683
01:12:26,656 --> 01:12:28,625
Lilongo.

684
01:12:31,127 --> 01:12:33,096
Lilongo!

685
01:12:34,998 --> 01:12:36,967
<i>Lilongo!</i>

686
01:12:43,006 --> 01:12:45,601
Where is she?
Where is she?

687
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:49,270
Last night, the old king's soldiers...

688
01:12:49,379 --> 01:12:51,371
struck down our guards and-

689
01:12:51,481 --> 01:12:53,450
And?

690
01:13:17,373 --> 01:13:20,172
Atua. Atua!

691
01:13:27,383 --> 01:13:30,148
Take the children down the river
to my lord Sandi...

692
01:13:30,253 --> 01:13:32,722
and give him this letter.

693
01:13:32,822 --> 01:13:35,758
And you, Lord Chief?

694
01:13:35,859 --> 01:13:38,693
I go over the mountain.

695
01:13:38,795 --> 01:13:42,664
Lord Chief, not even an army
could get into the Old King's Country.

696
01:13:42,765 --> 01:13:44,734
That's why I go alone.

697
01:13:50,139 --> 01:13:52,904
Good-bye, my son.

698
01:13:53,009 --> 01:13:55,774
I'm sending you to Lord Sandi...

699
01:13:55,879 --> 01:13:59,043
who will teach you the things
I was going to teach you.

700
01:14:04,587 --> 01:14:08,354
And who will make you
a great, great chief.

701
01:14:26,276 --> 01:14:28,404
Good-bye, my son.

702
01:14:39,589 --> 01:14:41,581
Look, Lord Tibbets.

703
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,529
Stop the boat.

704
01:14:46,629 --> 01:14:48,598
You go below
and bring them alongside.

705
01:15:06,783 --> 01:15:10,276
- Isn't that Bosambo's boy?
- Yes, lord.

706
01:15:10,386 --> 01:15:13,754
- Where are you taking him?
- To Lord Sandi, at the house of government.

707
01:15:13,856 --> 01:15:15,984
But what's happened to Bosambo?

708
01:15:16,092 --> 01:15:18,061
Agia!

709
01:15:19,128 --> 01:15:21,154
Agia, what's happening?
Why have we stopped?

710
01:15:21,264 --> 01:15:23,824
- I don't know.
- Uh, send my lord Tibbets here.

711
01:15:33,576 --> 01:15:35,977
Hello, Tibbets. What's the trouble?
Why have we stopped?

712
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:39,572
Topolaka's here,
with Bosambo's children.

713
01:15:41,551 --> 01:15:43,747
- His children?
- Yes, sir.

714
01:15:43,853 --> 01:15:46,118
Bosambo's gone into
the Old King's Country, alone.

715
01:15:47,190 --> 01:15:50,683
- He's gone where?
- The old king's kidnapped Lilongo.

716
01:15:50,793 --> 01:15:53,991
He's gone to try and get her back.
He sent you this note.

717
01:16:07,210 --> 01:16:09,406
Listen to this.

718
01:16:09,512 --> 01:16:13,472
"Even you could not
go over the mountain before the spring.

719
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:15,882
"Therefore I am going alone.

720
01:16:15,985 --> 01:16:20,184
"I am sending my children,
that they may live in the shadow of your house...

721
01:16:20,289 --> 01:16:23,589
"and be brought up with the money I have
from the government...

722
01:16:23,693 --> 01:16:25,662
as the government's children."

723
01:16:32,402 --> 01:16:34,997
Get my coat, will you?

724
01:16:35,104 --> 01:16:37,471
Agia!

725
01:16:37,573 --> 01:16:40,907
Agia, send Ayoko to my cabin, will you?

726
01:16:41,944 --> 01:16:45,073
- What are you going to do, sir?
- I don't know.

727
01:16:50,586 --> 01:16:53,715
Ayoko, we are going up to
the Old King's Country.

728
01:16:53,823 --> 01:16:56,122
I want you to turn the boat round...

729
01:16:56,225 --> 01:16:58,820
and go upriver
with all the steam you can get.

730
01:16:58,928 --> 01:17:02,797
But, lord, no ship ever got through
as far as the Old King's Country.

731
01:17:02,899 --> 01:17:05,334
Well, this'll be the first.
Go on, get a move on.

732
01:17:32,462 --> 01:17:35,398
A little chief brought shame upon me.

733
01:17:35,498 --> 01:17:37,433
I've waited very long.

734
01:17:37,533 --> 01:17:39,434
Soon he will die.

735
01:17:39,535 --> 01:17:43,472
But before he dies,
he will see you die!

736
01:17:43,573 --> 01:17:48,773
<i>Then everybody will know
what it means to bring shame upon me!</i>

737
01:17:48,878 --> 01:17:50,972
Lord, you haven't got him.

738
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:53,174
He's too great for you.

739
01:17:54,417 --> 01:17:56,511
And too cunning.

740
01:18:04,293 --> 01:18:07,388
Listen!

741
01:18:07,497 --> 01:18:10,956
He's coming!
Into my trap!

742
01:18:46,169 --> 01:18:49,264
Lord, I come in peace.

743
01:18:49,372 --> 01:18:51,273
O cunning one...

744
01:18:51,374 --> 01:18:53,309
where is your cunning now?

745
01:18:53,409 --> 01:18:58,074
Didn't I bring you here without a spear
behind you, when I took your woman?

746
01:18:58,181 --> 01:19:02,448
Lord, that is true.
This woman is life to me.

747
01:19:02,552 --> 01:19:05,420
And I would rather die at her side
than live with my people.

748
01:19:06,455 --> 01:19:11,723
But if you will allow her to go,
she will send you 2,000 gold pieces.

749
01:19:13,763 --> 01:19:15,664
Not your gold I want.

750
01:19:15,765 --> 01:19:18,860
It's your skin, for my drum!

751
01:19:18,968 --> 01:19:22,700
<i>You put shame upon me.
You shall die a slow death.</i>

752
01:19:22,805 --> 01:19:26,469
But before you die,
you shall see your woman die!

753
01:19:29,011 --> 01:19:31,207
Get him.

754
01:20:26,402 --> 01:20:29,065
- What are we making?
- Five and a half, Lord Tibbets.

755
01:20:29,171 --> 01:20:32,141
- Not enough. Put on some more wood.
- But the boiler will burst.

756
01:20:32,241 --> 01:20:35,109
- I said put on some more wood!
- More wood, Falu.

757
01:20:39,815 --> 01:20:43,479
- All things are with God.
- What's that?

758
01:20:43,586 --> 01:20:46,818
I believe I said
all things are with God, Lord Tibbets.

759
01:20:46,922 --> 01:20:49,357
Well, put on some more wood
and make sure of it.

760
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:51,427
Yes, lord.

761
01:22:32,561 --> 01:22:34,120
Now.

762
01:23:16,272 --> 01:23:18,298
King Mofolaba...

763
01:23:18,407 --> 01:23:21,605
do you remember what I said to you
in the field in front of the pass?

764
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:23,611
No, Lord Sandi.
I don't remember.

765
01:23:23,712 --> 01:23:26,272
I said that if you touched
a servant of the government...

766
01:23:26,382 --> 01:23:29,716
be it so little as a pigeon,
you wouldn't be king any longer.

767
01:23:29,819 --> 01:23:33,517
- I haven't hurt any of
the servants of the government.
- Who chopped Ferguson?

768
01:23:36,892 --> 01:23:38,793
Who chopped Ferguson?

769
01:23:38,894 --> 01:23:42,126
- Farini and Smith chopped Ferguson.
- That's a lie.

770
01:23:42,231 --> 01:23:44,894
Give me an iron. Don't move.

771
01:23:46,168 --> 01:23:49,002
If you make a sign to your guards,
you will die.

772
01:23:57,179 --> 01:23:59,614
All people, listen!

773
01:23:59,715 --> 01:24:01,877
- You know who I am.
<i>- Sandi the Tiger.</i>

774
01:24:01,984 --> 01:24:05,944
<i>- Sandi the eater of kings.</i>
- I am Sandi who gives you the law!

775
01:24:06,055 --> 01:24:08,024
Where are you councillors?

776
01:24:13,062 --> 01:24:15,031
Who killed Ferguson?

777
01:24:16,265 --> 01:24:19,633
- Answer me! Who killed Ferguson?
- King Mofolaba.

778
01:24:19,735 --> 01:24:22,034
Here, come look
at King Mofolaba now.

779
01:24:23,305 --> 01:24:25,240
He isn't king any longer.

780
01:24:25,341 --> 01:24:27,242
And so will I punish anyone...

781
01:24:27,343 --> 01:24:30,745
who dares to make even so much
as a movement against me.

782
01:24:30,846 --> 01:24:33,714
You will call your people to palaver.

783
01:24:38,487 --> 01:24:42,185
That was a close one.

784
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:44,317
- Bosambo.
- Yes, Lord Sandi.

785
01:24:45,594 --> 01:24:47,961
You will send for your warriors...

786
01:24:48,063 --> 01:24:50,055
and all the chiefs of the lower river.

787
01:24:50,165 --> 01:24:52,100
Yes, lord.

788
01:24:53,969 --> 01:24:58,430
Chiefs and people of the river,
in the name of my king...

789
01:24:58,541 --> 01:25:00,510
I will give you a new king.

790
01:25:02,545 --> 01:25:05,640
Not one who will
destroy his people with wars...

791
01:25:06,815 --> 01:25:11,981
but I will give you a king
who will make you a rich and great nation.

792
01:25:12,087 --> 01:25:14,852
A king who is wise and cunning...

793
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:18,826
who will keep the peace
and treat all men equally.

794
01:25:21,163 --> 01:25:23,132
<i>Bosambo.</i>

795
01:25:35,511 --> 01:25:40,006
Chiefs and people,
will you obey your king Bosambo?

796
01:25:40,115 --> 01:25:42,482
Yes! Yes!

797
01:26:03,272 --> 01:26:05,241
Well, Bosambo...

798
01:26:05,341 --> 01:26:07,742
you are king of the river.

799
01:26:07,843 --> 01:26:09,812
Your new people like you.

800
01:26:09,912 --> 01:26:13,508
I hope when I come back in 12 moons
they will still like you.

801
01:26:13,616 --> 01:26:17,485
Lord Sandi, I've learnt the secret
of government from Your Lordship.

802
01:26:17,586 --> 01:26:19,680
- You have?
- It is this:

803
01:26:19,788 --> 01:26:23,122
A king ought not to be feared,
but loved by his people.

804
01:26:23,225 --> 01:26:26,161
Go now, my friend.
Keep the peace of my king.

805
01:26:26,261 --> 01:26:28,230
