1
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,992
After the disasters,

2
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:08,496
it was as if life itself, it already stopped.

3
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,031
Everything burned.

4
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:12,300
Afterwards,

5
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,501
nothing seemed to grow again.

6
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:15,569
Nothing.

7
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,907
The cities died.

8
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,875
People looted them and ran to the sea.

9
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,377
But the seas had died too.

10
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:27,147
Empty...

11
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:29,049
And then, it rained again.

12
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,156
But the land and the people were still barren.

13
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:39,560
People died of hunger and disease, and hopelessness.

14
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:44,365
And the strong ones began killing
the weak ones for scraps of food.

15
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:47,335
Those who could, flocked together in tribes

16
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:50,371
and hid in caves and secret places.

17
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:53,040
And others became like wolves,

18
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,609
hunting and killing anything that moved.

19
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:57,845
They were ravagers.

20
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:01,328
Falk! Oh!

21
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,467
Miriam. Miriam.

22
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,838
Mmm. I heard a gunshot.

23
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,409
Did you see Ravagers?

24
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:17,945
Falk?

25
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,282
Well, I heard... I...

26
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,184
Thought I heard something.

27
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:25,719
But it was in the hills.

28
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:26,787
Probably some scouts.

29
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:28,489
Come on.

30
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,972
I really think it's time that we moved on, Miriam.

31
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,347
You get him, she's yours.

32
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,209
What have you done?

33
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,812
I put the bed over there and I put the table over there.

34
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,715
- Do you like it?-Yeah.

35
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:29,750
I like it.

36
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,253
All right, okay, they're up there somewhere.

37
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,756
Spread out. You two go around the back.

38
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,794
It's good.

39
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:42,830
Good.

40
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,102
- Falk...-Yeah, Miriam.

41
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,739
I, uh, I found something today.

42
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:02,783
See? Isn't it beautiful?

43
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,424
Miriam...

44
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,160
Wha... What?

45
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,862
Listen, it's dry.

46
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:17,765
There's nothing.

47
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,001
- Nothing. -No.

48
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,078
Hey...

49
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,182
It'll be all right.It's all right.

50
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:40,020
I told you not toprowl around out there.

51
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,822
That's my job. Understand?

52
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,125
Good.

53
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,288
Where will we go?

54
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,458
Well, uh, south.

55
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:23,330
- Yeah. -Well, won't they be going south, too?

56
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,165
Following the Flocker tribes?

57
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:30,003
Well, uh, yes, but, uh...

58
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,106
We've always managed to keep ahead of them before.

59
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,314
I was just beginning to feel safe here.

60
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,985
Yeah.

61
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:48,689
Well, that's when you start going careless.

62
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:52,726
Falk,

63
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,628
can we go back to that place on the beach?

64
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:57,998
Beach? Why?

65
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,466
Maybe the fish would come back.

66
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,971
Oh! I told you, please,

67
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,306
it's no use.

68
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:10,811
The seas are poisoned.

69
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,446
They're poisoned.

70
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,693
There has to be somewhere.

71
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,197
Must be somewhere.

72
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,434
A place where there's children.

73
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,109
Come on!

74
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:22,983
Falk, hurry.

75
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,619
Get him!

76
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,739
I kill!

77
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,650
Go up the tower.

78
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:02,890
Hurry.

79
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:23,110
Come on.

80
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,319
The bridge. Let's go.

81
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,370
Cross the bridge.

82
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,176
Kill him!

83
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,979
Kill him!

84
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,851
Go around there.

85
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,552
Miriam.

86
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,863
Miriam.

87
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:55,635
Miriam!

88
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,044
Miriam!

89
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,082
Miriam!

90
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,819
Miriam!

91
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:19,927
Miriam...

92
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,814
Someday it will happen again.

93
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,118
A woman somewhere will have a child.

94
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,055
No, Miriam.

95
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,214
Look what I found.

96
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,288
Look at this, look at this.

97
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,091
Give me a kiss, honey.

98
00:16:14,874 --> 00:16:16,309
Don't get wet now.

99
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:04,357
Boy fromthe steel mill.

100
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,941
We looked all over.He's long gone.

101
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,212
He's out there somewhere.

102
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,013
There's nobody alive out there.

103
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,416
I'll find him.

104
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,312
Move out!

105
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,497
Can we go back to that place on the beach?

106
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:01,133
Maybe the fish have come back.

107
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,002
It's a place called Genesis.

108
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,738
A place where things still grow.

109
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:07,640
It means something, Falk.

110
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:22,068
All the wayto the Appellate Court.

111
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,936
Don't think you can get away with this.

112
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:26,606
I'll teach you how the system works.

113
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:29,008
Don't think you can avoid appeals.

114
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,643
Costs be damned...

115
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,244
I won't lose this.

116
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:39,118
No, no... I'm onmy way, sir.Just on my way.

117
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:41,688
I... I'm not going to hurt you

118
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,389
I won't hurt you.

119
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:45,592
I don'tknow you, sir.

120
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:48,861
Oh, I'm... I'm just a guylooking for some food.

121
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,096
Uh, where are your tribe?

122
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:53,032
Oh.

123
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,602
Stand in front of me.

124
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,138
Do you know what a lawyer is?

125
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,707
Well, that's ancient history.

126
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,609
You just take me on them and I'll...

127
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,176
I'll talk to them.

128
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:06,579
Useless. There isn't enough. They threw me out.

129
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:07,947
Shh... Go on.

130
00:24:08,014 --> 00:24:09,549
I'll talk to them.

131
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:10,917
I'll talk to them.

132
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:12,685
I'll talk to them. I'm not going to hurt you.

133
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:13,753
Come on.

134
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:17,349
There's nobody here.

135
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,086
They're here.

136
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:36,869
Hold it!

137
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:40,673
Hey! Hold it!

138
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:44,677
Stop! Please stop!

139
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,714
Listen to me!

140
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,416
Just listen to me for a second!

141
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:54,453
Now! Stop! Listen, this...

142
00:28:57,503 --> 00:28:58,504
Halt!

143
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,571
Hands on your head.

144
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,841
Don't move!

145
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:13,585
This is amilitary installation.

146
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,687
You're trespassing.

147
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:17,423
Oh.

148
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,058
I... I didn't know that.

149
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:21,327
I'll just be moving along.

150
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:22,561
Hands!

151
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,698
"Special Order Number 18963.

Say your prayers...

Master Sergeant Cramer.

All right. Master Sergeant Cramer...

166
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:11,277
Now, shh.You just listen to mefor a second, will ya?

167
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:12,979
There's no government anymore.

168
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:14,847
There's noarmy anymore...

169
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:17,283
There's no law anymore.Just survival.

170
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:19,986
Ten seconds.

171
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:23,422
Take your choice.

172
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,858
Turn your back orface the firing squad.

173
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:21,948
Sergeant.

174
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:44,436
Food.

175
00:31:47,206 --> 00:31:48,840
You didn't get that belly eating grass.

176
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,110
You're eating food.

177
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,980
Yeah. Yeah.

178
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:56,648
Where do you hide it?

179
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,419
Follow me, Major.

180
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,021
Major?

181
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:04,790
Huh. What did you call me?

182
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:07,526
Follow me, Sir.

183
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,634
After you, Sir.

184
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:17,269
Watch your step. Watch your step.

185
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:46,765
Chair, Major.

186
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:18,090
Listen to me, Master Sergeant Cramer.

187
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,228
I'm not a goddamn Major. I'm a loner.

188
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,998
Now I'm gonna let you continue your little soldier game.

189
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,670
At least you've got a reason for living.

190
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,707
Before I go, I want you to show me...

191
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:37,976
How to use this thing.

192
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:00,532
Sergeant!

193
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,038
Now I'm telling you for the last time, Sergeant.

194
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,074
Go back to your soldier game.

195
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:10,542
Go on, move!

196
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:26,925
Major,

197
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:29,395
I know wherethere's people.

198
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,129
And music. Liquor.

199
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,066
- That's a kind of Flocker camp? -Yeah, yeah.

200
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:38,570
And Major, the women.

201
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,572
You've never seen anything like 'em.

202
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:01,219
We'll stow ourgear here, Sir.

203
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:03,622
Good idea not to show 'em what we're carrying.

204
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:04,690
I'll talk to 'em.

205
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:20,572
Brought the Major for a little R and R this time. Right?

206
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:27,713
Come on, Major. Everybody's waiting for you.

207
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:30,749
Hurry up.

208
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:05,116
Have no fear, Major.

209
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,685
They're as friendly as you get these days.

210
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,984
Like any other town, Major, near an Army post.

211
00:38:40,352 --> 00:38:41,820
Good and bad.

212
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:44,790
You know thosecivilian women.

213
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:50,662
I keep tellingthe boys,"Flies spread disease,

214
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:54,332
- "keep zipped." -Sergeant, who are those people?

215
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,001
Flockers, Sir.

216
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,536
You give them something, they'll give you something.

217
00:38:57,603 --> 00:38:58,604
- Sergeant!-Ah-ha!

218
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,239
Mmm...

219
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:09,180
This one's name's Grace, Sir. Amazing, isn't she?

220
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:10,516
Oh, yeah.

221
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:12,918
Good luck, Sir.

222
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:20,459
Mister... You havesomething to trade.
Uh, the bag, maybe.

223
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,193
The bag.

224
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:24,162
You hungry?

225
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:29,200
I don't have anything to trade.

226
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:31,202
I only asked if you were hungry.

227
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:34,940
Take these.

228
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:38,577
There's a couple of trees that still bear a little.

229
00:39:38,644 --> 00:39:40,245
They're stubborn.

230
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,680
Go on. Take them.

231
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,282
Take them.

232
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:49,421
Sir.

233
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:53,659
Come here.

234
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:57,195
Take this.

235
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,666
I... I didhave something,

236
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:03,569
but not to trade. Please.

237
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,486
Stop it!

238
00:42:01,553 --> 00:42:02,588
Stop it!

239
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,491
Oh!

240
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:07,593
Oh!

241
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,831
Let go of me.

242
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:15,000
Stop it!

243
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:16,401
No!

244
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:17,936
No!

245
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:04,750
I'm not going to hurt you.

246
00:43:06,217 --> 00:43:07,619
I wasn't worried.

247
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:12,557
Who are you?

248
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:14,660
Nobody. My people, I, uh...

249
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:17,462
I got separatedfrom my people.

250
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,432
I got tobacco.

251
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,087
- Tobacco. -No.

252
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,922
Yeah.

253
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:45,023
No.

254
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:51,262
Uh-uh.

255
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:52,597
Oh, yeah.

256
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:54,165
Not all of it.

257
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,835
- Half. -A third?

258
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,872
I don't come cheap.

259
00:44:02,173 --> 00:44:05,677
Oh, okay. Have half.

260
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:37,976
Some things still grow.

261
00:44:38,043 --> 00:44:40,611
More things grow now than used to.

262
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:43,314
It means something, Falk.

263
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:48,720
Genesis. Again?

264
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:52,123
My God, my God, haven't you seen enough?

265
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:54,893
You still can't believe that.

266
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,095
Yes. Yes, I do.

267
00:44:58,563 --> 00:44:59,798
No, Miriam.

268
00:44:59,865 --> 00:45:02,033
No. No, Miriam.

269
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,634
For God sake, Miriam.

270
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,971
For God sake, get it out of your head!

271
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:15,747
What is it?

272
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:17,448
What's the matter?

273
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:21,186
You almost hit me.

274
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,156
Oh, I must have been dreaming.

275
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:30,295
Her name's Miriam, huh?

276
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,836
Yeah.It was. Miriam.

277
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:40,806
Oh.

278
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,946
You kept saying, "Genesis."

279
00:45:50,015 --> 00:45:51,649
Genesis.

280
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:57,055
It's like in that Bible.

281
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,028
Is there such a place?

282
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:07,165
No. No.

283
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:15,606
It means "in the beginning,"doesn't it?

284
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:18,676
I don't know. I don't know.

285
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,080
I don't know.

286
00:46:22,948 --> 00:46:24,615
It's only a dream.

287
00:46:25,851 --> 00:46:27,718
No, it's only a dream.

288
00:46:35,861 --> 00:46:37,528
It's just a dream.

289
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,453
Just taking your fair share.

290
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,591
I was going to keep it all.

291
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,063
Well, why the hell not?

292
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,698
You're leaving anyway, weren't you?

293
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:16,834
Yeah.

294
00:47:18,603 --> 00:47:20,538
You're going someplace. Huh?

295
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:23,408
Genesis.

296
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:27,812
Take me with you. Please.

297
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:37,989
I told you. It's nothing.

298
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:40,091
It's just a dream.

299
00:47:50,735 --> 00:47:51,802
Hey.

300
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:39,250
Oh!

301
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:07,678
Major!

302
00:49:11,049 --> 00:49:14,585
Sergeant, you are a hard man to lose.

303
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:15,953
I want to give you warning, Sir.

304
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:18,489
Burned.

305
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:20,525
Could be crawlingwith ravagers.

306
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:22,160
All around.

307
00:49:22,227 --> 00:49:24,162
Keep an eye out.

308
00:49:24,229 --> 00:49:26,331
Only way to make sure. Only way.

309
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:29,200
You're raving, Sergeant.

310
00:49:29,267 --> 00:49:31,202
This place is as safe as any other.

311
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:33,171
If they burned it, it was a long time ago.

312
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:35,873
So you forget about it.

313
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,176
- Now go back where you belong. -All right.

314
00:49:38,243 --> 00:49:41,479
I'll keep a sharp eye outfor any moving lights.

315
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:50,388
Sergeant! What the hell you doing?

316
00:49:50,455 --> 00:49:52,290
I heard somebody out there.

317
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:53,358
Follow me.

318
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:01,632
Sergeant, get down, get down.

319
00:50:03,568 --> 00:50:06,071
They're out there, Sir. Do you hear 'em?

320
00:50:07,105 --> 00:50:08,273
Sergeant, back!

321
00:50:09,274 --> 00:50:10,541
Get back!

322
00:50:12,543 --> 00:50:14,011
There's one! Take him!

323
00:50:19,317 --> 00:50:20,651
All right.

324
00:50:23,121 --> 00:50:24,689
I've been following you since yesterday.

325
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,957
- What the hell for? -Well, why the helldo you think?

326
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,127
Welcome to the post, ma'am.

327
00:50:58,223 --> 00:50:59,290
Sir.

328
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:03,594
Here's the watch list for the Major's approval.

329
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:04,729
We're a little short of personnel,

330
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,164
but I think we can manage, Sir.

331
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:08,833
Your bath is ready, Sir.

332
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:10,668
Me first.

333
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,224
Sergeant.

334
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:35,893
Yes, Sir.

335
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,163
Isn't there, uh...

336
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:40,131
Isn't there anything you can remember?

337
00:51:41,532 --> 00:51:44,402
I remember many casualties, Sir.

338
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:47,238
The Major having to operate the bulldozer.

339
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:48,839
Digging a mass grave.

340
00:51:50,475 --> 00:51:52,543
Sergeant, that wasn't me.

341
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,812
That was a grim task, Major.

342
00:51:54,879 --> 00:51:57,648
Well, maybe it was your Major
that you buried in the grave.

343
00:51:58,383 --> 00:52:00,485
You were very ill, Sir.

344
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:02,987
Sergeant, I was six years old then.

345
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:05,523
Don't you understand anything?

346
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:22,740
Falk...

347
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:25,343
What?

348
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:28,012
I can't go back to my people.

349
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:34,785
Why?

350
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:36,921
Once you leave, you can't go back.

351
00:52:37,722 --> 00:52:39,457
They kill you.

352
00:52:39,524 --> 00:52:41,326
Now listen to me. I...

353
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:44,862
I don't want you dead.

354
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:45,930
I just want you gone.

355
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:47,798
You understand?

356
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:48,866
Now...

357
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,035
Tomorrow you're going.

358
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:52,370
You, him.

359
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:04,682
Tomorrow, Sir,
drop her off at the nearest Civil Defense Center.

360
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:28,906
Let me give him one.

361
00:53:42,587 --> 00:53:44,088
Ask him again.

362
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:54,899
He ain't gonna be doin' much talkin'.

363
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:31,035
Nobody is following us.

364
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,111
I'll find you some shelter,

365
00:54:43,381 --> 00:54:44,382
then we're splitting up.

366
00:54:45,182 --> 00:54:46,183
Let's go.

367
00:55:25,189 --> 00:55:26,791
All secure, Sir.

368
00:55:41,138 --> 00:55:42,807
All right, let's get us some sleep.

369
00:55:44,074 --> 00:55:45,242
Sergeant...

370
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,148
I'll show youto your quarters, Miss?

371
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:49,940
Look what I found.

372
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:17,434
You'll forget her.

373
00:57:17,502 --> 00:57:19,403
Leave me alone, please.

374
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:23,073
No!

375
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,409
Look, what I've been trying to tell you all along...

376
00:57:25,476 --> 00:57:26,644
Faina.

377
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:29,046
Say my name.

378
00:57:30,481 --> 00:57:31,649
Faina.

379
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,018
Faina.

380
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:36,521
Faina.

381
00:57:36,587 --> 00:57:37,922
All right?

382
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,624
Faina.

383
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:43,861
You don't like to be teased, do you?

384
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,835
I told you I was a loner.

385
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:52,837
There's no room in my life for another woman.

386
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:54,605
One was enough.

387
00:57:54,672 --> 00:57:56,273
You couldn't love her that much.

388
00:58:04,649 --> 00:58:06,651
Take that damn dress off.

389
00:58:07,351 --> 00:58:08,385
No.

390
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:11,321
Take the dress off!

391
00:58:11,388 --> 00:58:13,257
- No! -Take it off!

392
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,526
Take it off!

393
00:58:15,593 --> 00:58:18,829
Look, there's no room in my life for anybody.

394
00:58:18,896 --> 00:58:20,097
Do you understand?

395
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:21,566
Now please, leave me alone.

396
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:23,133
No.

397
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:30,007
Faina, please, please, listen to me.

398
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:33,077
I'm made all wrong for this.

399
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:34,745
I'm not what you think I am.

400
00:58:34,812 --> 00:58:36,146
I'm not what I seem to be.

401
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:38,549
I'm good for you, you'll see.

402
00:58:38,616 --> 00:58:41,151
What makes you so goddamn stubborn?

403
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:52,396
When my older sister died,

404
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:56,466
she dug her nailsinto the back of my handuntil I cried.

405
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,769
She said the painwould make me remember.

406
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:00,270
Remember what?

407
00:59:01,105 --> 00:59:02,372
Never to be afraid.

408
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:07,678
And never, never to be ashamed.

409
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,103
Leave that up. Hurry.

410
00:59:48,753 --> 00:59:50,420
I'll cover you from the other side.

411
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,491
Looks like there's nobody here.

412
00:59:57,361 --> 00:59:58,362
Candle wax.

413
01:00:05,169 --> 01:00:06,203
Behind you!

414
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:17,447
Move out, Major. Move out.

415
01:00:17,514 --> 01:00:18,749
Come on.

416
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,021
Sergeant!

417
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:25,455
Go on,I'll catch up with ya.

418
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:29,960
You're gonna get it, you lousy bastards!

419
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:41,338
Come on, you...

420
01:00:59,223 --> 01:01:00,590
What is it?

421
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:06,196
Nothin'.

422
01:01:08,132 --> 01:01:09,399
I mean...

423
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,137
He was just a crazy old fool, wasn't he?

424
01:01:14,538 --> 01:01:16,006
We couldn't have saved him.

425
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:20,244
It wasn't your fault, you know.

426
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,215
I guess.

427
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:26,817
We gotta keep moving.

428
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:29,119
Come on.

429
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:35,059
Come on.

430
01:02:46,363 --> 01:02:48,265
Turn the old man loose.

431
01:02:51,368 --> 01:02:52,469
Falk.

432
01:02:57,341 --> 01:02:58,708
Careful, now.

433
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,144
Ravagers?

434
01:03:02,212 --> 01:03:03,247
No.

435
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:04,314
Easy...

436
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:05,615
No, they're not.

437
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:07,317
Give you a handwith this here.

438
01:03:11,755 --> 01:03:12,923
Easy...

439
01:03:19,897 --> 01:03:20,931
Don't move.

440
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:24,368
Please.

441
01:03:27,671 --> 01:03:29,173
I don't want to hurt you.

442
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:30,474
Just want to talk.

443
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:34,144
Who are you?

444
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:36,847
You look fed.You've got new clothes.

445
01:03:36,914 --> 01:03:40,117
You look like peopleused to look...

446
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:43,153
Long ago.

447
01:03:47,858 --> 01:03:49,226
Are you people from Genesis?

448
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:51,628
Hand over that weapon

449
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:53,864
and we'll talk.

450
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:57,667
Come on.

451
01:03:59,904 --> 01:04:02,406
We're going with you. So, come on.

452
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:28,532
Major!

453
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,041
My God! It's the Sergeant.

454
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,543
Major.

455
01:04:41,578 --> 01:04:43,180
Help him, Faina.

456
01:04:51,956 --> 01:04:53,423
Hold up there.

457
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:54,959
- A little scratch. -Hold up.

458
01:05:26,723 --> 01:05:28,392
Let's go!

459
01:05:54,151 --> 01:05:55,352
My God!

460
01:07:39,923 --> 01:07:41,291
Heave away.

461
01:07:45,529 --> 01:07:47,664
Hey, steady.

462
01:08:02,779 --> 01:08:05,249
Oh, look at all this.

463
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:11,221
These ships. How did you people find them?

464
01:08:11,288 --> 01:08:14,057
Find them? No, it wasn't like that.

465
01:08:14,124 --> 01:08:17,060
Rann brought us here with the ships a long time ago.

466
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:18,795
- Oh, my God.-Yeah.

467
01:08:18,862 --> 01:08:21,365
- Look, they keep bringing more things. -Yeah.

468
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:22,499
Where's it coming from?

469
01:08:22,566 --> 01:08:24,701
This is just the storeroom.

470
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:26,336
The other ship is full of supplies.

471
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:28,438
50 years worth.

472
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:30,474
We could live like this for 50 years.

473
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:33,943
In hiding Rann says.

474
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,345
Who, who... Who's Rann?

475
01:08:36,213 --> 01:08:37,714
Rann is Rann.

476
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:38,815
Oh.

477
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,222
When you change,

478
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,225
I want to show you something.

479
01:09:12,015 --> 01:09:13,016
It's real.

480
01:09:14,518 --> 01:09:15,919
It works.

481
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,222
How?

482
01:09:18,288 --> 01:09:19,356
We have a generator.

483
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,391
Lots of diesel fuel.

484
01:09:24,027 --> 01:09:25,595
Oh.

485
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:29,266
The last time I saw electric lights I, uh...

486
01:09:30,334 --> 01:09:32,369
Why, I was a kid.

487
01:09:34,204 --> 01:09:35,372
Lots of comforts.

488
01:09:38,041 --> 01:09:39,443
We almost have everything.

489
01:09:45,982 --> 01:09:47,284
Come with me.

490
01:10:35,632 --> 01:10:38,268
Come on, you can see all of this later.

491
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,215
Hey.

492
01:10:53,317 --> 01:10:54,551
Can I talk to you?

493
01:10:57,487 --> 01:11:01,958
Look. Look, you show me marvels.

494
01:11:02,025 --> 01:11:05,862
Food... Uh... Uh, electric lights.

495
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:09,265
Uh, things that, uh... I mean, you show me things

496
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:11,868
that nobody else in the world has.

497
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:15,672
Yet, you're trying to tell me that
something is wrong about it.

498
01:11:17,407 --> 01:11:18,575
Now what is it?

499
01:11:19,543 --> 01:11:21,044
Come on, what is it?

500
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,880
Well...

501
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:24,981
Yeah.

502
01:11:25,048 --> 01:11:27,250
You and that girl was going someplace.

503
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:29,553
Where?

504
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:32,389
Nowhere.
Anywhere.What the hell differencedoes it make?

505
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:34,491
Genesis.

506
01:11:34,558 --> 01:11:36,292
Oh, God, that Genesis again.

507
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,694
The girl,

508
01:11:37,761 --> 01:11:39,396
we all heard her.

509
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,632
You know where it is.

510
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:46,370
Look, there's no such place.

511
01:11:46,436 --> 01:11:48,605
And even if there was,

512
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:51,575
I mean, uh, why would anybodywant to leave all this?

513
01:11:56,179 --> 01:11:57,180
Yeah.

514
01:11:58,147 --> 01:11:59,349
Uh-huh.

515
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:00,917
Yeah, you're cautious.

516
01:12:03,587 --> 01:12:04,588
Fair enough.

517
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:07,056
I'll show you now.

518
01:12:11,628 --> 01:12:12,962
Who is it?

519
01:12:15,131 --> 01:12:16,933
Open up. Just be a minute.

520
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:51,100
Brown!

521
01:12:51,167 --> 01:12:53,069
Tell him we are not going to run.

522
01:12:53,136 --> 01:12:54,571
Tell him it was all a mistake.

523
01:12:55,472 --> 01:12:57,474
Sure. Sure,I'll tell him.

524
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,444
He listens to you, doesn't he?

525
01:13:02,579 --> 01:13:03,613
No.

526
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:06,315
No?

527
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:11,120
What are they alldoing in there?

528
01:13:13,957 --> 01:13:15,525
They want to leave the ship.

529
01:13:17,494 --> 01:13:18,762
Rann says no.

530
01:13:21,297 --> 01:13:22,466
Nobody leaves.

531
01:13:25,669 --> 01:13:27,571
Bring up the small boat.

532
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:29,372
Hey. Watch it.

533
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:31,775
They're somewhere behind that island.

534
01:13:33,477 --> 01:13:34,478
Over here.

535
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:36,145
Move!

536
01:13:36,212 --> 01:13:37,681
Come on. Move it!

537
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:46,389
Is that Rann?

538
01:13:47,957 --> 01:13:49,058
We done it before.

539
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:50,594
I remember how my dad...

540
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:11,080
His name is Falk.

541
01:14:19,889 --> 01:14:21,625
- MAN: Ah.

542
01:14:24,994 --> 01:14:26,563
Pass me the bread.

543
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:32,035
Ever think you'd see anything like this, Falk?

544
01:14:32,101 --> 01:14:33,469
Not ever.

545
01:14:33,537 --> 01:14:34,671
Never.

546
01:14:37,741 --> 01:14:39,408
And I've seen a Flocker's camp before.

547
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,612
We're not Flocker's here.

548
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:56,626
I guess I spoke out of turn.

549
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,228
Yes, you did.

550
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:02,231
I'll accept your apology. You did apologize?

551
01:15:02,298 --> 01:15:04,601
Oh, yes.Oh, yes. Sure.

552
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:07,236
I'm sorry.-

553
01:15:09,739 --> 01:15:11,975
How come you've seen so many Flocker camps, Falk?

554
01:15:12,542 --> 01:15:13,610
Huh?

555
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,511
What does it matter?

556
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:20,216
I mean, maybe you're not Flockers

557
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:22,118
and you should think you're better off than them,

558
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:23,553
and in some respects you are.

559
01:15:24,921 --> 01:15:27,123
You see, what, what I mean is,

560
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:30,459
there's no real difference.

561
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,862
They hide. And you hide.

562
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,865
They're afraid of strangers,

563
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,034
you're afraid of strangers.

564
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:40,036
Hold on, Falk. You're getting out of line.

565
01:15:40,103 --> 01:15:41,504
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

566
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:44,974
Now let him saywhat he thinks.

567
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:48,511
Um, if you had todecide for us,

568
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:50,980
what would you do?

569
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:52,448
Speak up.

570
01:15:52,515 --> 01:15:54,083
We're interested in your opinion.

571
01:15:55,184 --> 01:15:56,185
Well...

572
01:15:58,154 --> 01:15:59,989
It seems to me that

573
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:03,192
hiding in fear is not the answer.

574
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:04,861
There may be something better out there.

575
01:16:05,762 --> 01:16:07,764
But you'll never know it.

576
01:16:07,831 --> 01:16:11,134
Not if you stay here, locked and caged up,

577
01:16:12,636 --> 01:16:15,071
just waitingfor everything to end.

578
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:18,541
You've, uh, you've got to take a chance.

579
01:16:18,608 --> 01:16:20,910
And gamble awayall our lives,

580
01:16:20,977 --> 01:16:23,647
in the hope that there's something better out there?

581
01:16:25,048 --> 01:16:26,115
Why?

582
01:16:27,450 --> 01:16:30,053
We have everything we need right here.

583
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:31,621
- MAN: Yeah, we sure do.

584
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:33,589
Except hope.

585
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:39,195
Well, now...

586
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:41,397
Well, look around you, Falk.

587
01:16:41,464 --> 01:16:43,132
Isn't this better than...

588
01:16:46,636 --> 01:16:47,704
Huh.

589
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:52,375
It can't be.

590
01:16:55,912 --> 01:16:56,980
It... It's real.

591
01:16:59,783 --> 01:17:01,350
Caught this morning.

592
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:03,086
We get 'em right here.In the channel.

593
01:17:11,995 --> 01:17:13,529
The fish, yeah,

594
01:17:14,864 --> 01:17:15,865
returned.

595
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,434
They're showing upmore and more.

596
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:20,804
Maybe it's a sign.

597
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:22,538
Damn it, Hank, that's enough!

598
01:17:23,406 --> 01:17:25,809
Now, once and for all,

599
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:28,244
I say the land is finished.

600
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:29,578
Maybe not, Rann!

601
01:17:31,247 --> 01:17:33,516
Now look, maybe not.

602
01:17:34,918 --> 01:17:36,820
If the fishhave come back,

603
01:17:36,886 --> 01:17:39,723
that means the seas are not poisoned.

604
01:17:39,789 --> 01:17:41,791
So why can't the land come back?

605
01:17:41,858 --> 01:17:45,061
Look, when I was in a Flocker's camp,

606
01:17:45,128 --> 01:17:46,329
I met an old man.

607
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:47,596
He gave me an apple.

608
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,098
He gave me two apples. Two.

609
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:50,867
New, ripe apples.

610
01:17:52,035 --> 01:17:53,770
Doesn't that mean something to you people?

611
01:17:54,738 --> 01:17:56,840
Well, doesn't it?

612
01:17:56,906 --> 01:17:59,608
Somewhere things are beginning to grow again.

613
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:02,111
Maybe children.

614
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:06,182
Children are beginning to... To... To be born once more.

615
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:08,852
Can't you see that?

616
01:18:08,918 --> 01:18:10,253
Well, can't you?

617
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:13,089
It's settled.

618
01:18:13,156 --> 01:18:14,657
Nobody leaves this ship.

619
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:19,963
You mean that I am a prisoner here, too?

620
01:18:21,464 --> 01:18:23,066
Prisoner? Huh.

621
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:25,001
You can do anything you want.

622
01:18:25,068 --> 01:18:28,137
As long as it doesn't jeopardize the rest of us.

623
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,606
Well, I can live by anything then.

624
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:33,977
That makes sense.

625
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:38,181
Good. Good, I'm glad to hear it.

626
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:40,917
Because our rulesmake a lot of sense.Hmm?

627
01:18:40,984 --> 01:18:42,685
- Right?

628
01:18:42,752 --> 01:18:44,187
Oh, by the way, are you with him?

629
01:18:44,253 --> 01:18:45,288
- No. -Yes.

630
01:18:46,756 --> 01:18:47,791
No.

631
01:18:47,857 --> 01:18:49,358
Yes.-

632
01:18:49,425 --> 01:18:50,794
No, she's not.

633
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:52,228
She doesn't know.

634
01:18:52,295 --> 01:18:53,963
There seems to be a difference of opinion.

635
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:58,835
Now you see,
this is where our rules come in very handy.

636
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:01,237
A good-looking unattached woman

637
01:19:01,304 --> 01:19:05,274
can be a threat to the peaceof the community.

638
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:07,710
Now, we're not telling youwho to choose,

639
01:19:07,777 --> 01:19:10,179
but you've got to choosesomebody.

640
01:19:15,284 --> 01:19:16,285
Him.

641
01:19:17,153 --> 01:19:18,955
Aha.

642
01:19:19,022 --> 01:19:20,790
Done! You're married.

643
01:19:27,931 --> 01:19:30,433
A toast to the Major and his lady.

644
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:33,302
Good luck to both of you in married quarters, Sir.

645
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:35,038
To the Major.

646
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:37,240
This calls for a celebration.

647
01:19:37,306 --> 01:19:38,641
Bring out the whiskey.

648
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:43,079
Oh, plug in the jukebox.

649
01:20:03,766 --> 01:20:06,502
Hey, Falk, they're all dancing back there.

650
01:20:10,573 --> 01:20:12,909
Come on. Don't you ever dance?

651
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:23,119
You're laughing.

652
01:20:23,186 --> 01:20:25,321
See, you like being married.

653
01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:27,256
Admit it.

654
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:42,438
My God.

655
01:20:43,973 --> 01:20:46,509
- What makes you so damn... -Stubborn?

656
01:20:50,013 --> 01:20:51,014
I told you.

657
01:20:51,915 --> 01:20:53,182
I'm good for you.

658
01:20:54,984 --> 01:20:55,985
Come on.

659
01:20:56,986 --> 01:20:58,254
Let's go back to the music.

660
01:21:10,733 --> 01:21:12,068
Falk!

661
01:21:14,837 --> 01:21:16,172
What do you want?

662
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:17,606
We want to talk to you.

663
01:21:34,423 --> 01:21:35,724
What?

664
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:38,094
We want to know about Genesis. Where is it?

665
01:21:40,063 --> 01:21:41,530
I don't know.

666
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:45,268
I thought this was it.

667
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:48,004
But I was wrong.

668
01:21:49,872 --> 01:21:53,009
Come on, you can trust us.

669
01:21:53,076 --> 01:21:54,777
You heard what the man said.

670
01:21:55,945 --> 01:21:58,147
He'll never let you leave this ship.

671
01:21:58,214 --> 01:22:01,184
What if he can't stop us?

672
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,551
We've got others.

673
01:22:03,386 --> 01:22:04,653
Will you lead us?

674
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:40,656
Admiral, it was amazing.

675
01:22:41,424 --> 01:22:42,491
They had me.

676
01:22:42,558 --> 01:22:44,127
I mean, they really had me.

677
01:22:44,193 --> 01:22:47,196
Then the stupidbastards cut meloose up there.

678
01:22:48,531 --> 01:22:50,066
They cut you loose? -

679
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,202
Ravagers! -

680
01:22:53,269 --> 01:22:54,837
Let's go, let's go, come on!

681
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:56,539
Follow me to the Armory.

682
01:22:56,605 --> 01:22:58,674
Move, come on, move it.

683
01:22:58,741 --> 01:23:02,278
Brown, get some men,
get up topside and see if you can hold 'em off.

684
01:23:02,345 --> 01:23:03,346
Okay.

685
01:23:10,153 --> 01:23:11,420
Come on!

686
01:23:24,033 --> 01:23:25,034
Here you go.

687
01:25:00,496 --> 01:25:02,731
I'm here, Major. I'll cover you, Sir.

688
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:09,738
We're finished. We gotta get off this thing.

689
01:25:09,805 --> 01:25:12,007
There's a hatchway where they brought water through.
Do you remember?

690
01:25:12,074 --> 01:25:13,642
I remember. How do we find it?

691
01:25:13,709 --> 01:25:15,010
Follow me, Sir.

692
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:20,983
Go on, Sergeant, get out of here. Take her with you.

693
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,094
Brown, where do we go?

694
01:25:32,161 --> 01:25:33,929
Through the doorway.

695
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,467
Look out!

696
01:28:28,203 --> 01:28:29,438
Genesis?

697
01:28:34,543 --> 01:28:35,644
Well,

698
01:28:39,382 --> 01:28:41,016
I guess we're it.

699
01:28:51,293 --> 01:28:52,528
Come on!
