1
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,951
Who may we seek for succor
but of thee, oh, Lord,

2
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,370
who for our sins are justly.

3
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,414
Thy merciful ears to our prayer.

4
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,666
For as much as the spirit
of our deceased brother

5
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,900
Maxim hath departed unto God who giveth

6
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:53,338
we commit his body to the ground.

7
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:58,367
Earth to earth, ashes
to ashes, dust to dust.

8
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,679
In sure and certain
hope of the resurrection

9
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:04,332
unto eternal life through our Lord, amen.

10
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:06,060
Amen.

11
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:07,185
Amen.

12
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:08,687
That must be the son John Raden.

13
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,814
Gee, he's not hard to take.

14
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:12,274
Too bad he's married.

15
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,861
Dearly beloved, in
this hour of farewell,

16
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,946
I know there are those among you

17
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,532
who would like to pay a parting tribute

18
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:23,601
to his inspiring life and
great accomplishments.

19
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:27,414
This fair town, which
proudly bears his name,

20
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,626
the great Raden Mills,
beehives of industry.

21
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,712
Yeah, beehives without the bees.

22
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,048
Dr. Saunders, you've been a friend

23
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,990
of the Raden family for 35 years.

24
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,992
Isn't there something you'd like to say?

25
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:45,098
Well, Maxim Raden built this town

26
00:02:45,122 --> 00:02:47,541
from a bunch of shanties
to what it is today.

27
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,837
He was a man of action, not words.

28
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,817
Well, there's nothing more I can say

29
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:58,844
except that his death is a great loss.

30
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:00,614
To who?

31
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:01,449
Shh.

32
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,116
After all, he's dead.

33
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,141
Let us pray.

34
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,665
Almighty Father, whose
mercies cannot be numbered,

35
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,941
accept our prayers on behalf of the soul

36
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:15,128
of thy servant departed,
and grant him entrance

37
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:17,297
into the land of light and joy

38
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:19,156
in the fellowship of thy saints.

39
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,242
Amen.

40
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:26,766
Would you excuse me a moment, John?

41
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,790
Of course.

42
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:32,586
Pompey.

43
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,110
What do you mean by leaving

44
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,135
the house unguarded at a time like this?

45
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,990
Ain't nothing to get
pernickety about, Dr. Ben, sir.

46
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:45,701
Ain't no folks going out
there raiding a house

47
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,370
with hands peeking out of the windows.

48
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,229
Besides, I'm full out of house money.

49
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,835
Here.

50
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:55,961
Now you get along back there double-quick,

51
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,504
and don't take any more chances.

52
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,529
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,491
Where'd you get that?

54
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,618
I reckon you know.

55
00:04:09,915 --> 00:04:12,978
When I come back tonight,
I'll fix it up for you.

56
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,522
Things can't go on like this any longer.

57
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,547
No, sir.

58
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:18,883
Just a minute, please.

59
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,016
You're Pompey, aren't you?

60
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:29,560
You don't remember me, do you?

61
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,373
Yes, sir, you Mr. John.

62
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:36,626
That's right, although I
couldn't blame you if you didn't.

63
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,336
How long ago was it, Dr. Ben?

64
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,213
25 years.

65
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:42,799
The day we buried your twin brother.

66
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:44,176
That was Paul.

67
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,427
Remember, he was 10 then.

68
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,869
The spitting image.

69
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:51,749
Pompey, this is Mrs.
Raden, the lady I married.

70
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,626
How do you do?

71
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,838
She's a very pretty lady, Mr. John.

72
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,777
It's getting pretty late, Pompey.

73
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,737
Chickens got to be fed.

74
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,988
Goodbye, Pompey.

75
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:07,223
We'll see you again before
we go back to New York.

76
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,083
Raden House.

77
00:05:17,107 --> 00:05:18,502
Let's go there, John.

78
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,753
I'd love to see it.

79
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:20,921
All right, if you'd like.

80
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,506
Oh, I wouldn't advise it.

81
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,199
The house is very old, and
badly in need of repair.

82
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,660
It really isn't safe.

83
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,846
Surely, if it was safe enough

84
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,223
for John's father to live in.

85
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,724
He didn't live there.

86
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:34,434
Right after John's mother died, he moved

87
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,585
to the old Raden Hotel
and never went back.

88
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,404
I realize this has been a
very trying day for you, John,

89
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:49,765
but I have something
important to tell you.

90
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,203
I'd like you to come to my house tonight.

91
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,955
Don't mind, do you, dear?

92
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:55,790
Of course not.

93
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:56,814
All right, Dr. Ben.

94
00:06:01,026 --> 00:06:02,736
As early as you can, John.

95
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:32,845
Hello, Pompey.

96
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,162
It's a beautiful storm, isn't it?

97
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:39,309
This is the exciting part of it,

98
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,394
when it's hanging over you like this,

99
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:43,671
threatening, waiting to break loose.

100
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,781
Is you all right, Mr. Paul?

101
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,016
Yes, Pompey, I won't
be any more trouble.

102
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,857
You can take this off now.

103
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:18,556
Have they buried him?

104
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,101
Yes, sir, Mr. Paul, your
pappy done been buried.

105
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,710
Good, good.

106
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,239
You didn't let them
bury him next to Mother?

107
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,389
No, sir, Mr. Paul.

108
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,704
I couldn't stand if
he were where he could

109
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,747
hurt her and make her scream again.

110
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:45,792
He can't never
hurt her no more, Mr. Paul.

111
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,961
You're lying to me,
Pompey, you're lying!

112
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,546
No, sir, Mr.
Paul, I ain't lying.

113
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,238
He can't never hurt her no more.

114
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:53,383
I'm going to see for myself.

115
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,467
You don't wanna do that, sir.

116
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:55,969
Yes, I do, I'm
going to see for myself.

117
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,078
Don't be riling yourself, sir, please.

118
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:11,884
All right, all right, Pompey.

119
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,471
I want my supper now, please.

120
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:39,369
I have an appointment with Dr. Saunders.

121
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:41,723
Just get in?

122
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,058
Just going out.

123
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,083
Don't take it off.

124
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,145
We're going to Raden House.

125
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,670
Something wrong with Pompey?

126
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,465
It isn't Pompey.

127
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,260
Look, Dr. Ben, I'm too
tired for guessing games.

128
00:09:57,387 --> 00:09:59,306
That'll be all for tonight, Joseph.

129
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,351
Come in here, John.

130
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:12,569
Look, the Dr. Benjamin
Saunders Medical Foundation.

131
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,489
Yes, I know, your
place, yours and Father's.

132
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,284
The finest free institution
of its kind in the South.

133
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,787
We've saved hundreds of lives,

134
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,873
and checked four major epidemics.

135
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:30,438
It's worth quite a good
deal, don't you agree, John?

136
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:31,463
I certainly do.

137
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,883
Well, it's cost me quite a good deal.

138
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:38,220
More than an ordinary
man would care to pay.

139
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:44,560
In exchange for your father's money,

140
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,914
I performed a criminal act.

141
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,208
You, a criminal act?

142
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:53,026
I falsified a death certificate
for your brother Paul.

143
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,280
Paul?

144
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,115
He's still alive.

145
00:10:59,366 --> 00:11:00,784
But I went to his funeral.

146
00:11:02,369 --> 00:11:03,579
You went to a funeral.

147
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:09,060
Paul's at Raden House?

148
00:11:09,084 --> 00:11:10,085
Yes,

149
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,147
where your father and
I have kept him hidden

150
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,424
for 25 years, a hopeless maniac.

151
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,509
Lately, a dangerous one.

152
00:11:30,814 --> 00:11:33,066
John, I'm quite an old man.

153
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:37,255
I've carried this load for a long time.

154
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,199
I feel it's up to you to take
that burden off my shoulders.

155
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:44,953
Yes.

156
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:47,748
Yes, of course.

157
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:14,000
I always park the car here.

158
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,877
They can't see it from the highway.

159
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,838
Dr. Ben, before I
was sent off to school,

160
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:20,798
Paul seemed perfectly normal.

161
00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:21,823
What happened?

162
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:25,887
Didn't you ever wonder
why you were shipped away?

163
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,555
Not particularly.

164
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:29,665
Well, your father did that deliberately.

165
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,353
He knew your mother
worshiped both of you boys,

166
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,938
and, by sending one away to school

167
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,005
and always threatening to send the other,

168
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,635
it gave him the whip hand,
and made her life unbearable.

169
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,490
One day, little Paul heard her screaming.

170
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,432
He broke in and rushed at your father.

171
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:50,227
Your father threw him across the room.

172
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:53,730
From that day on, Paul was different.

173
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,460
One night, I found him huddled

174
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:58,670
against the edge of the fountain,

175
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,756
his little hands pressed against his ears,

176
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,573
to shut out her screams, he said.

177
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,035
She'd been dead for two months.

178
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,664
Even now, that's how his attacks start.

179
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,810
He puts his hands to his ears.

180
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,752
He still thinks he hears her screaming.

181
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,257
Look, over there by the grave.

182
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:34,980
Come on, John.

183
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,802
Everything all right, Pompey?

184
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,077
Pompey, Pompey.

185
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:06,511
Paul, this is Dr. Ben!

186
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,889
Paul, where are you?

187
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:14,269
Paul.

188
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,776
Paul!

189
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,491
Paul!

190
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,746
Dr. Ben, we'd better call the police.

191
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,898
No, John, leave everything to me.

192
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,790
We can't let him run loose.

193
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:19,352
You can't afford a scandal, John.

194
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,854
There's your wife to consider, too.

195
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:24,172
I know Paul, I'm his friend, he trusts me.

196
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,635
He'll either come back
here or go to my house.

197
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,388
It's the only two places he knows.

198
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,141
Once we get him quieted down,

199
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:37,894
it'll be easy enough to spirit him away.

200
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:43,442
I hope you're right, Dr. Ben.

201
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:46,129
I know I'm right, John.

202
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,404
Just have faith in me.

203
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:50,550
Now, I'll drive you over to your hotel,

204
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:54,595
and I'll come back here,
destroy all evidences of Paul,

205
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:55,787
and seal the room.

206
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,898
What about Pompey's body?

207
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:08,734
They won't challenge
my death certificate.

208
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:12,196
Pompey was an old man with a bad heart.

209
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,014
They never questioned the other one.

210
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:42,686
Elaine.

211
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,271
Yes?

212
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,417
What?

213
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:49,919
I'm gonna give him a
highball to keep him asleep.

214
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,278
You better come right over.

215
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,364
Right away.

216
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,825
What is it, dear?

217
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:01,055
It's Pompey, he's had a heart attack.

218
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,683
Aw, poor old Pompey.

219
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,708
I'll have to go.

220
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,877
Of course, dear.

221
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:45,081
Hello, Dr. Ben.

222
00:18:46,082 --> 00:18:48,918
Hello, Paul, what are you doing here?

223
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:53,006
Where am I?

224
00:18:53,923 --> 00:18:55,634
You're in my house.

225
00:18:58,511 --> 00:18:59,679
Oh, so I am.

226
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,432
Oh, that's funny.

227
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,354
I haven't been here in a long time.

228
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:11,542
My window's been broken.

229
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:14,194
Do you know anything about that?

230
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:22,303
I must have done that, Dr. Ben.

231
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,621
I rang the bell, but there was no answer.

232
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,207
I had to come in and lie down.

233
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:29,376
I was very tired.

234
00:19:32,128 --> 00:19:34,440
Tell me, Paul, what prompted you

235
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,257
to come and see me so late at night?

236
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,052
I don't know.

237
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:40,845
Try and remember.

238
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,449
Try and remember what happened

239
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,826
before you broke through that window.

240
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,812
Take it slowly, think.

241
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:03,118
It was very dark and wet.

242
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:15,547
I was walking around
outside, all by myself.

243
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:18,859
I like that, Dr. Ben.

244
00:20:18,883 --> 00:20:21,261
I like walking around outside by myself.

245
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,096
Feels good.

246
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:27,600
I don't have to go back to that
room anymore, do I, Dr. Ben?

247
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:31,938
No, Paul, not if you think
hard, tell me what happened.

248
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,566
I will.

249
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,512
I fell down, guess that's
where I got all the mud.

250
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,829
Where did you fall down?

251
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,186
There were a lot of flowers,

252
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,646
but I didn't like the flowers.

253
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,106
I wanted to throw them all away.

254
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,024
Where were the flowers?

255
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:00,049
They were...

256
00:21:04,053 --> 00:21:06,866
They were on a grave,
that's were they were.

257
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,391
They were on my father's grave!

258
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,809
Steady, Paul.

259
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,147
He's dead.

260
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,024
They buried him today.

261
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,671
He can't hurt Mother anymore.

262
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:22,173
He hasn't been able to hurt your mother

263
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,216
for a long, long time.

264
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,241
No?

265
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:29,388
You haven't heard her
screaming all these years.

266
00:21:29,412 --> 00:21:32,141
You'll never
hear her scream again.

267
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:32,976
You father's dead.

268
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,796
I know, I fixed him so he
can never get at her anymore.

269
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,174
Pompey lied to me.

270
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:44,552
He told me they didn't
bury him next to her.

271
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:46,513
I wanted to make sure.

272
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,243
Pompey wouldn't let me out.

273
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:52,536
But you got out.

274
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,772
Yes, when I heard her
screaming like that,

275
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,191
I had to get out.

276
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:09,202
So I asked Pompey to fix my supper.

277
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:14,707
Then I sneaked up behind
him and took my fingers.

278
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:19,295
Show me how you took your fingers.

279
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,234
But I don't wanna hurt you, Dr. Ben.

280
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,301
I'm not afraid of you hurting me, Paul.

281
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:32,201
Well, I just wanted
to frighten him, see,

282
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:36,312
so he would let me out,
so I took my fingers.

283
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:41,168
Oh, you hurt me!

284
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:42,211
You wanna take me back to that room!

285
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,754
- No, Paul!
- Yes, you do!

286
00:22:43,778 --> 00:22:44,673
You're like all the rest!

287
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,006
You're like my father and Pompey!

288
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,424
Oh, I won't go back!

289
00:22:47,448 --> 00:22:50,493
It's good outside, it's good
to walk around by myself!

290
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:56,016
Is someone coming to get me to take me

291
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,851
back to that room?

292
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,686
No, Paul.

293
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,502
Well, they'll never lock me up again!

294
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,671
Paul!

295
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,590
Paul!

296
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:10,889
Paul's escaped.

297
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,328
Then we've got to call the police.

298
00:23:16,352 --> 00:23:17,496
Oh, at this time of the morning,

299
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,081
they'll go after him like a wild animal,

300
00:23:19,105 --> 00:23:20,523
with dogs and shotguns.

301
00:23:21,774 --> 00:23:24,861
If that's what you want,
there's a phone on my desk.

302
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,264
I never knew Doc Saunders
to slip up like this before.

303
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,724
Morning, gents.

304
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,350
Anything for the press?

305
00:23:38,374 --> 00:23:39,375
No!

306
00:23:43,796 --> 00:23:45,149
Hello, Doc?

307
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:48,360
Say, the coroner's here
with his report on Pompey.

308
00:23:48,384 --> 00:23:50,762
Looks like you gave the
old guy a fair shuffle.

309
00:23:51,846 --> 00:23:52,699
What do you mean?

310
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:56,035
Well, your certificate says
he died of heart failure.

311
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,560
Coroner says he was strangled.

312
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:02,774
Gosh, Andy, I don't see how
I made a mistake like that.

313
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,713
What do you want me to do?

314
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,298
Well, drop in next time
you're down this way.

315
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,382
We'll fix it up.

316
00:24:10,406 --> 00:24:11,491
Don't worry about it.

317
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:13,928
Maybe he had a little run-in

318
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,537
with one of those spooks
up at Raden House.

319
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,356
Extra, extra, read all about the killer!

320
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,400
Old negro found murdered, extra, extra!

321
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:31,236
Extra, extra, read all about the killer!

322
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,573
Old negro found murdered, extra, extra!

323
00:24:34,597 --> 00:24:35,450
Thank you, Mister.

324
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,726
Extra extra, read all about the killer!

325
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,168
Well, see where those
ghosts up at Raden House

326
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:47,419
did their work again.

327
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:48,712
I'm glad somebody's working.

328
00:24:48,736 --> 00:24:50,506
Say, maybe we oughta
send a delegate up there

329
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,508
to get him to sign up for the union.

330
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,509
Here's something screwy.

331
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,261
They found him with his
hands up to his ears.

332
00:24:56,285 --> 00:24:57,453
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

333
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:23,664
Here you are, Mister!

334
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,457
Read all about the killer.

335
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,041
Old negro found murdered.

336
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:28,085
Mystery baffles police.

337
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,463
Aw, come on, Mister, buy it, help me out.

338
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:33,424
My ma takes in wash, and she's got

339
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,800
a big washing to do.

340
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,177
Only, she ain't got no
money for some soap,

341
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:39,555
and, if you buy this
paper, I can buy the soap,

342
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,015
and Ma can do the washing.

343
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,999
See, please, Mister.

344
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,630
Hey, Mister, you forgot your paper!

345
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,010
He's nuts.

346
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,811
Put that down.

347
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:27,877
Looking for a room?

348
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,981
Yes.

349
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:32,632
Can you pay a week in advance?

350
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:34,985
Yes, I can.

351
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:36,987
Come in, come in.

352
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:38,280
I knew the minute I clapped eyes on ya

353
00:26:38,304 --> 00:26:39,806
that you was a gentleman.

354
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,785
Come in, come in.

355
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:45,204
Oh, don't trip over the vacuum.

356
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,479
I was cleaning the foyer.

357
00:26:47,396 --> 00:26:48,981
Foyer's French for "front hall."

358
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,168
I had one of them Frenchmen living here

359
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,878
for three months last year.

360
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,214
He had the back room on the second floor.

361
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:58,175
Honest to goodness, every
time you turned 'round,

362
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,719
that Frenchman was a-grabbing
for a hand and kissing it.

363
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:03,138
He like to have wore the skin off.

364
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:04,497
Oh, thank you.

365
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,643
I always admired a gentleman.

366
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,269
But if there's one thing I hate

367
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:11,105
is to have somebody slobbering over me,

368
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,898
but, I must say, that
he paid his room rent

369
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,067
right on the dot, so I just let him

370
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,068
keep right on kissing.

371
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,236
Millie!

372
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,071
Millie's my daughter.

373
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,846
She'll show you the rooms.

374
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:24,076
You're quite sure you can pay in advance?

375
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,309
Yes, I can pay.

376
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:30,290
Good, no cooking allowed,
and no foul language.

377
00:27:30,314 --> 00:27:32,292
I didn't always tell my roomers this,

378
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:34,837
but we had a man here last month.

379
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,131
Honest to goodness, the
language that that man used

380
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,590
would've melted your gold tooth.

381
00:27:38,614 --> 00:27:40,467
Yes, Mom?

382
00:27:40,491 --> 00:27:42,910
Millie, dear, you show
the gentleman the room.

383
00:27:55,756 --> 00:27:56,609
Just a minute.

384
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,277
This is a respectable rooming house.

385
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,344
No ladies permitted in gentlemen's rooms.

386
00:28:09,645 --> 00:28:11,748
Ma just says that for her conscience.

387
00:28:11,772 --> 00:28:13,792
Since she got the lumbago two years ago,

388
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:15,335
she can't get upstairs.

389
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:16,444
Oh, that's too bad.

390
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,446
You think so?

391
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,241
Here 'tis.

392
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,524
It's kinda noisy here in front, ain't it?

393
00:28:37,548 --> 00:28:38,549
Yes.

394
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:42,362
Look, don't tell Ma I said so,

395
00:28:42,386 --> 00:28:44,239
but there's a room in back
that's better than this.

396
00:28:44,263 --> 00:28:46,450
It's nice and quiet and
it's only three bucks.

397
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,951
Oh, but I like it here.

398
00:28:47,975 --> 00:28:49,060
You can see people.

399
00:29:01,697 --> 00:29:03,508
But the
other's a dollar cheaper!

400
00:29:03,532 --> 00:29:04,951
Oh, but I like this room.

401
00:29:05,826 --> 00:29:08,222
I like to be able to see people.

402
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,307
You can them on the street for nothing.

403
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,100
Don't you care about the extra buck?

404
00:29:12,124 --> 00:29:13,125
No.

405
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:18,631
Here, one, two, three, four.

406
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,653
There.

407
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:22,986
Brother!

408
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,156
Say, if I had a wad of
folding dough like that

409
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,200
I'd go right out and buy myself an outfit

410
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:31,370
that would knock this
neighborhood cock-eyed.

411
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,979
Oh, but that's a pretty dress.

412
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,898
Oh, isn't that just like a man?

413
00:29:36,857 --> 00:29:38,859
It's practically falling apart.

414
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,698
Is that enough?

415
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:46,534
30 bucks!

416
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:48,995
Gee, I should hope to tell ya.

417
00:29:51,497 --> 00:29:53,225
I can't take money form you.

418
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:55,293
Oh, but I want you to have a new dress.

419
00:29:57,628 --> 00:30:01,424
Well, gee, that's nice of ya, thanks!

420
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,987
No strings?

421
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,513
Strings, where?

422
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,266
All right then.

423
00:30:11,183 --> 00:30:15,122
Listen, don't say a word to
Ma, or she'll skin me alive.

424
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,707
Why?

425
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:19,817
Oh, come now, Mister, please!

426
00:30:22,778 --> 00:30:24,339
I tell ya what.

427
00:30:24,363 --> 00:30:25,882
We'll call it a loan,
and I'll pay you back

428
00:30:25,906 --> 00:30:27,033
when the mill's opened.

429
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,471
And the mill's going to open soon?

430
00:30:31,495 --> 00:30:33,265
Everybody thinks so.

431
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,166
That's why you're here, isn't it?

432
00:30:35,207 --> 00:30:36,268
Well.

433
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,102
Do you work there?

434
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,021
When they're running.

435
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,129
Then we could work there
together, couldn't we?

436
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,175
For a quiet-looking guy,
you're a pretty fast worker.

437
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:49,031
Well, let's hope the mills open soon

438
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,015
so we can work together.

439
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:53,618
When will that be?

440
00:30:53,642 --> 00:30:55,561
Don't ask me, ask John Raden.

441
00:30:58,814 --> 00:30:59,875
John Raden?

442
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,169
He's the boss
since his old man died.

443
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,795
Where is he now?

444
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:05,380
Who, Raden?

445
00:31:05,404 --> 00:31:06,882
At the hotel.

446
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,468
Hey, what goes on up there?

447
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,927
That's Bill Oakley.

448
00:31:10,951 --> 00:31:12,512
He thinks because he rooms here steady,

449
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:13,954
he's got a lease on me.

450
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,308
Hey, Millie!

451
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:19,227
Keep your shirt on, this is business.

452
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:21,396
Come on down here.

453
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,023
You leave that girl alone.

454
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,067
If you wanna boss her around, marry her

455
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:25,902
and make it legal.

456
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:28,904
You got a rule around here
about no women in the rooms.

457
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,822
Well, that goes for Millie, too, see?

458
00:31:30,846 --> 00:31:31,699
Well, she was only showing

459
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,015
the gentleman a room.

460
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:38,521
Say, what's your name
in case there's some mail?

461
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,333
I never get any mail.

462
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,192
Somebody might send you a postcard.

463
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,629
Paul.

464
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,822
Okay, Mr. Paul, see ya later!

465
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:55,138
John Raden.

466
00:31:55,162 --> 00:31:56,390
Oh, Millie.

467
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,016
What's the name of that hotel,

468
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,644
the one where John Raden is staying?

469
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,669
The Raden Hotel.

470
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,298
The Raden Hotel.

471
00:32:07,716 --> 00:32:09,218
John Raden.

472
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:43,752
Just a moment, please.

473
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:56,950
I'm sorry if I frightened you,

474
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:59,494
but I'm looking for my brother John.

475
00:32:59,518 --> 00:33:01,145
I'm Paul.

476
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:09,754
Don't you know about me?

477
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:11,197
You're John's wife.

478
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:13,574
Where is John?

479
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,889
I want to know where he is.

480
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:19,914
I must see him.

481
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,675
Go in the other room, Elaine, please.

482
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,950
I'm very glad to see you, Paul.

483
00:33:38,974 --> 00:33:40,452
John.

484
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,019
I've been trying to find you.

485
00:33:43,562 --> 00:33:45,564
You're a grownup man now, John.

486
00:33:46,732 --> 00:33:47,942
I must be, too.

487
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:51,129
Why didn't you answer my letters?

488
00:33:51,153 --> 00:33:52,255
You could've helped me.

489
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:55,050
I'm sorry, but I never got them.

490
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,801
Let me try and make it up to you.

491
00:33:56,825 --> 00:33:58,470
We've many things to talk over.

492
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,495
Let's sit down.

493
00:34:02,456 --> 00:34:03,457
Thank you.

494
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,977
I only came to find out when you're going

495
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:07,878
to open up the mills.

496
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,920
The mills?

497
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,484
I'm planning to do it very soon.

498
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,509
Why?

499
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,613
A friend of mine is going to work there.

500
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,782
I'm going to work with her.

501
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,825
Oh, that's fine.

502
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:22,661
What friend is that?

503
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,103
Oh, you wouldn't know her.

504
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:29,543
I must go and tell her now.

505
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,569
Wait, don't go yet.

506
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,879
But I want her to know!

507
00:34:32,903 --> 00:34:33,904
Paul!

508
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,466
Stay here with us.

509
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,117
You'll have a nice place to live.

510
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,845
But I have a nice place to live.

511
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:42,347
I like it there.

512
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,682
That's fine.

513
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,891
Well, where is it?

514
00:34:44,915 --> 00:34:46,309
I'll come and see you there.

515
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:49,980
No, I will come and see you.

516
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,815
But, if you stay here, we'll see

517
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,757
that you have everything that you want.

518
00:34:54,883 --> 00:34:57,028
But I have everything that I want.

519
00:34:57,052 --> 00:34:58,655
I'm with nice people.

520
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,199
I'm going to work with them, every day.

521
00:35:01,223 --> 00:35:04,703
Please, Paul, Dr. Saunders
and I want to help you.

522
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,621
You mean Dr. Ben?

523
00:35:06,645 --> 00:35:08,540
He isn't my friend any more!

524
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,417
He wants to take me back to that room!

525
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,294
Maybe you wanna take me back to that room!

526
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,546
Well, I won't go!

527
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,654
- Stop it!
- Paul!

528
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:22,536
Stop that screaming!

529
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,659
Wanna buy a puppy, Mister?

530
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,625
Thank you, sir.

531
00:36:46,578 --> 00:36:48,038
Hey, sir!

532
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,432
Plenty room, sir.

533
00:36:49,456 --> 00:36:50,457
Table or bar?

534
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,936
I want my supper.

535
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,672
Oh, yes, I got a nice
table right over there, sir.

536
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,863
Well, did you hear the
one about the cockroach?

537
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:08,892
Oh, I heard that.

538
00:37:10,477 --> 00:37:11,603
Hey, what's the idea?

539
00:37:13,188 --> 00:37:14,791
It has such a nice perfume.

540
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,292
Oh it has, has it?

541
00:37:16,316 --> 00:37:18,152
Take it easy, Eddie.

542
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,464
He's with me.

543
00:37:21,488 --> 00:37:23,198
Yeah, well, keep him on a leash.

544
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,553
Watch yourself, partner.

545
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,471
That's no way to act in a place like this.

546
00:37:28,495 --> 00:37:31,224
But it had such a nice fragrance.

547
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:32,249
Uh huh.

548
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:34,918
All by yourself?

549
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:37,940
Yes.

550
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:38,964
So am.

551
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:43,069
Do you mind if I sit down for a minute?

552
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:44,553
That would be very nice.

553
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:48,265
Bourbon.

554
00:37:49,683 --> 00:37:50,768
What will it be, handsome?

555
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,603
I'm hungry.

556
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,564
Oh, you shouldn't go out
to eat on an empty stomach.

557
00:37:56,231 --> 00:37:57,316
Make it two.

558
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:17,312
What are they doing?

559
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,378
They call it...

560
00:38:19,421 --> 00:38:22,216
Say, where do you keep yourself,
in a cave or some place?

561
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:24,927
No.

562
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,430
I've been away, for a very long time.

563
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,350
Welcome home.

564
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,733
50 cents, boss.

565
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,132
Oh, I can't change that, sir.

566
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:47,759
That's all right.

567
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,784
Yes, sir.

568
00:38:51,286 --> 00:38:52,287
Happy days.

569
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:55,266
That's a very nice expression.

570
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,291
Happy days.

571
00:39:12,474 --> 00:39:15,036
Makes you feel kind of funny inside.

572
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,687
Why, that's what they make it for.

573
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,695
What's the matter, big boy?

574
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,928
Don't you like my looks?

575
00:39:51,054 --> 00:39:54,284
Oh, yes, but I like Millie better.

576
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:57,745
Oh, who's Millie, your girlfriend?

577
00:39:57,769 --> 00:39:58,770
She's beautiful.

578
00:40:00,355 --> 00:40:02,733
Well, maybe she should
be here instead of me.

579
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,735
I wish she was.

580
00:40:06,778 --> 00:40:09,799
Well, thanks for the drink.

581
00:40:09,823 --> 00:40:11,092
Bring Millie in sometime.

582
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:12,969
We'll all go over to my
house and bake a cake.

583
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:13,888
Oh, I'd like that!

584
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,078
Don't be a dope.

585
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,640
- Hiya, Frank.
- Hiya, babe.

586
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,999
- Alone?
- I was.

587
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,103
You can't go away like that.

588
00:40:22,127 --> 00:40:23,211
Just watch.

589
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,725
Gimme that.

590
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,045
What's eating him?

591
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,213
He's got a snootful.

592
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,048
Snootful?

593
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:33,174
He's just two jumps ahead of a fit.

594
00:41:33,198 --> 00:41:35,617
Come on, let's get a drink.

595
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:40,539
- So long, Peggy.
- So long, Kate.

596
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,457
Read all about it, mill
girl murdered by fiend!

597
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,084
Read all about it!

598
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:34,253
Mill girl murdered by fiend, extra, extra!

599
00:43:34,277 --> 00:43:36,464
Mill girl murdered by fiend!

600
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,965
"According to the
sheriff, nobody remembers"

601
00:43:37,989 --> 00:43:41,094
"seeing anyone leave the River
Bottom Cafe with the victim."

602
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,286
"The sheriff admits that he's baffled."

603
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,182
A fine sheriff we've got.

604
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:49,185
Anybody can be baffled,
there's no trick to that.

605
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,561
What I wanna know is what's being done

606
00:43:50,585 --> 00:43:52,897
to protect the citizens of this town.

607
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,399
Two people dead, and the
murderer still on the loose,

608
00:43:55,423 --> 00:43:57,801
and all the sheriff does
is to say he's baffled.

609
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,488
I tell you, this killer's gotta be stopped

610
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,781
if we have to do it ourselves.

611
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,932
I think
you're right there, Bill.

612
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,537
Who is it?

613
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,854
It's me Millie, open the door.

614
00:44:11,773 --> 00:44:14,585
Look, I got it, the whole outfit,

615
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:16,337
and two pair of stockings.

616
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:17,362
This is the hat.

617
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,966
It's a very pretty hat.

618
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,510
Wait til you get a
load of me in the dress.

619
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:23,761
I'd like to.

620
00:44:23,785 --> 00:44:25,054
You're going to, right now.

621
00:44:25,078 --> 00:44:26,264
Turn around.

622
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,098
What for?

623
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:27,932
What do you think?

624
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:28,851
I'm gonna give you a private showing.

625
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,667
After all, you're entitled to it.

626
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,295
Now, no peeking.

627
00:44:52,939 --> 00:44:53,940
Now you can look.

628
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,507
Like it?

629
00:45:01,531 --> 00:45:02,925
Oh, it's beautiful.

630
00:45:02,949 --> 00:45:05,261
We strive to please.

631
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,889
Gee, it was swell of
you to do this for me.

632
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,206
Thanks!

633
00:45:10,665 --> 00:45:12,500
What's going on down there?

634
00:45:14,377 --> 00:45:15,712
Oh, Bill Oakley.

635
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,483
Making a noise like a mastermind.

636
00:45:19,507 --> 00:45:21,092
He gives me a pain.

637
00:45:23,136 --> 00:45:25,781
Well, now that you've got me all fixed up,

638
00:45:25,805 --> 00:45:29,243
I'm gonna take you right
out and get you fixed up.

639
00:45:29,267 --> 00:45:30,620
Come on!

640
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:31,996
We'll search every house in town,

641
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,415
from the cellar to the
roof, every warehouse.

642
00:45:34,439 --> 00:45:36,876
Since our police department
seems to be so baffled,

643
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,336
we'll organize a searching party

644
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,254
and nab this maniac ourselves.

645
00:45:40,278 --> 00:45:42,757
- Sure.
- That would sure be fine,

646
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:44,616
if anybody knew what he looked like.

647
00:45:56,294 --> 00:45:59,982
Well, that's one way of
satisfying your boarders.

648
00:46:00,006 --> 00:46:02,485
When you learn to act
as elegant as Mr. Paul,

649
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,862
maybe Millie will be more interested.

650
00:46:04,886 --> 00:46:08,098
Us Pickens has always had
a weakness for refiners.

651
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,180
You take off your outside wrappings,

652
00:46:31,204 --> 00:46:33,498
and up pops a different guy.

653
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,434
Now, when we walk down the street,

654
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:37,353
we'll look like we belong together.

655
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,188
We will?

656
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:41,565
Mm hmm, all except that shrubbery.

657
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:43,717
Why don't you buy a
razor and shave it off?

658
00:46:45,176 --> 00:46:47,989
You don't see him wearing a muff, do ya?

659
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,116
It's because he knows what's what.

660
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,141
All right.

661
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,745
"The curious aspect of the murderer”

662
00:46:54,769 --> 00:46:56,414
"is that the victim was
found with her hands"

663
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,398
"pressed tightly against her ears."

664
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,794
What does that suggest to you?

665
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,587
Oh, that somebody's
been smart enough

666
00:47:03,611 --> 00:47:07,049
to take advantage of that story
about Pompey in the papers.

667
00:47:07,073 --> 00:47:09,576
I'm afraid we've delayed
much too long, Dr. Ben.

668
00:47:14,205 --> 00:47:15,349
Yes?

669
00:47:15,373 --> 00:47:17,351
The sheriff's
on the wire, Mr. Raden.

670
00:47:17,375 --> 00:47:18,394
Good.

671
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,104
Hold on a minute, John.

672
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,629
You better let me talk to him.

673
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:26,193
Hello, Andy, Mr. Raden's
tied up right now.

674
00:47:26,217 --> 00:47:27,903
This is Doc Saunders.

675
00:47:27,927 --> 00:47:29,363
I'm glad it's you, Doc.

676
00:47:29,387 --> 00:47:31,490
You're closer to Mr.
Raden than anyone in town.

677
00:47:31,514 --> 00:47:33,117
We're in a tough spot.

678
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,142
You see.

679
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:36,811
Not a bad idea.

680
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,440
- Just a minute.
- What is it?

681
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,585
He wants you to put up a reward.

682
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:43,545
Reward?

683
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,904
Yeah, a reward for the
capture of the Killer.

684
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,174
I think you better do it.

685
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,425
Are you out of your mind?

686
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,450
Not entirely.

687
00:47:51,534 --> 00:47:55,163
Hello, Andy, Mr. Raden says make it 5,000.

688
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,686
That's pretty highhanded
business, Dr. Ben.

689
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:02,462
I'm doing you a favor, John.

690
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:06,150
If they happen to discover
Paul before we do,

691
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,693
you'll have a perfect alibi.

692
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:09,737
I don't need an alibi!

693
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,781
You might find it rather
difficult to explain

694
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,407
why you didn't report Pompey's death

695
00:48:13,431 --> 00:48:14,641
right after it happened.

696
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:19,038
People might think you were
trying to shield your brother.

697
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,247
That's being an accessory,

698
00:48:20,271 --> 00:48:21,999
and you're liable to criminal action.

699
00:48:22,023 --> 00:48:23,024
No more than you.

700
00:48:24,025 --> 00:48:26,861
That's right, no more than I.

701
00:48:28,863 --> 00:48:32,742
But I don't intend to face such
action if I can prevent it.

702
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,473
I think I see what's bothering you.

703
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:39,290
It's those false death certificates.

704
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,894
There's a lot of people in this town

705
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,605
depending on me, John, and I don't intend

706
00:48:44,629 --> 00:48:47,441
to let myself get tripped up
at this stage of the game.

707
00:48:47,465 --> 00:48:50,027
I'm not so sure your motives
are entirely unselfish.

708
00:48:50,051 --> 00:48:52,154
I think you're just trying
to save your own neck.

709
00:48:52,178 --> 00:48:53,823
And what do you intend doing about it?

710
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,849
Calling the police and tell the truth.

711
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,895
Every man for himself
now, is that it, John?

712
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,273
Put it any way you like.

713
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:09,338
Before you start anything,
John, remember this.

714
00:49:09,362 --> 00:49:10,881
If they ever do open that grave,

715
00:49:10,905 --> 00:49:14,159
they'll find the unrecognizable
remains of a boy of 10.

716
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:18,180
You have no evidence against me.

717
00:49:18,204 --> 00:49:20,724
But, on the other hand, my statement

718
00:49:20,748 --> 00:49:23,436
that, despite my appeal, you allowed Paul

719
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,688
to run loose after he killed Pompey

720
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,839
will put you in an embarrassing position.

721
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,676
Dr. Ben, I don't believe
you'd have the nerve to do that.

722
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:35,305
Well, there's one sure way to find out.

723
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:40,185
Insanity sometimes runs in families.

724
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:43,062
Think it over, John.

725
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,635
What are they talking about?

726
00:49:56,659 --> 00:49:58,721
The murders, silly.

727
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,389
Doesn't the thought of
that murderer skulking

728
00:50:00,413 --> 00:50:03,392
around close by somewhere
give you the creeps?

729
00:50:03,416 --> 00:50:04,643
It does me.

730
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:06,479
I wonder what he looks like.

731
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,795
Here's your razor.

732
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,317
Thank you.

733
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,693
Hey, pay him!

734
00:50:12,717 --> 00:50:14,093
Oh.

735
00:50:21,267 --> 00:50:22,644
You get change.

736
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:24,562
Oh.

737
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,023
You need a keeper.

738
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:45,667
I love perfume, don't you?

739
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,771
Someday, I'm gonna have a big, fat bottle

740
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,881
and pour the whole thing
over me, all at once.

741
00:50:53,174 --> 00:50:54,342
Your change.

742
00:50:56,844 --> 00:50:59,448
We want a big, fat bottle of perfume.

743
00:50:59,472 --> 00:51:03,369
Oh, say, I wasn't hinting, honest.

744
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,870
What kind did you want?

745
00:51:04,894 --> 00:51:06,372
Oh, that kind.

746
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:11,001
Gee, yeah, only it's
so expensive, isn't it?

747
00:51:11,025 --> 00:51:12,110
$15.

748
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,279
Oh.

749
00:51:15,738 --> 00:51:16,924
Attention, please.

750
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:19,617
This is a special announcement
from the sheriff's office.

751
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,470
Sheriff Andrew Ramsey wishes to announce

752
00:51:21,494 --> 00:51:23,681
that John Raden, President
of the Raden Mills,

753
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:26,767
is offering $5,000 reward for information

754
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:29,103
leading to the capture
of the person or persons

755
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,854
responsible for the death of Mr. Raden's

756
00:51:30,878 --> 00:51:33,857
negro servant Pompey or Miss Peggy Nolan.

757
00:51:33,881 --> 00:51:36,110
$5,000, dead or alive.

758
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,469
5,000 bucks, let's go and get him!

759
00:51:44,934 --> 00:51:45,787
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

760
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,454
$5,000!

761
00:51:47,478 --> 00:51:49,039
I could get a fur coat.

762
00:51:49,063 --> 00:51:50,791
I could get out of this town!

763
00:51:50,815 --> 00:51:52,960
We could go to New York!

764
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:53,985
$5,000, yoo-hoo!

765
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:56,821
That's for little Millie!

766
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,494
Let's start over at the old warehouse.

767
00:52:07,248 --> 00:52:08,601
You come back to the house!

768
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,877
Not til I get that $5,000 reward.

769
00:52:10,918 --> 00:52:11,979
No, you're not!

770
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:12,939
Break it up, break it up,

771
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,898
go back to your homes, go on, break it up,

772
00:52:14,922 --> 00:52:16,758
go back, go back home!

773
00:52:23,389 --> 00:52:25,659
Listen, I got everything
all figured out.

774
00:52:25,683 --> 00:52:28,603
Gee, what a difference a shave makes!

775
00:52:30,396 --> 00:52:32,875
Everybody will say, "My,
what a nice-looking couple,”

776
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:35,502
when they see our pictures in the paper.

777
00:52:35,526 --> 00:52:37,129
Pictures in the paper?

778
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:39,214
Sure, when we collect the reward.

779
00:52:39,238 --> 00:52:40,633
I got it all figured out.

780
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,259
The papers say every road is blocked.

781
00:52:42,283 --> 00:52:44,053
That means the murderer's still in town.

782
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,639
Now, there's one place that's
perfect for him to hide.

783
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,765
Everybody's scared to go near it.

784
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:48,932
They think it's haunted.

785
00:52:48,956 --> 00:52:50,184
The murderer probably knows that

786
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:52,311
and is sitting up there laughing at us.

787
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,438
Well, he's not gonna laugh at me,

788
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,482
"cause we're going up
there to Raden House.

789
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,108
Raden House?

790
00:52:58,132 --> 00:52:59,425
I don't wanna go up there!

791
00:53:00,843 --> 00:53:01,696
Why not?

792
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,906
Well, you don't know he's there.

793
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,057
No, but I'm gonna find out.

794
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:13,815
Don't you like me?

795
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,213
Yes.

796
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,822
Then won't you do what I want?

797
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,702
Yes.

798
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:28,246
Well, then.

799
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,584
I'm afraid to go up there.

800
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,069
Look what I got.

801
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,570
It's Pop's old .38.

802
00:53:43,594 --> 00:53:45,555
I sneaked it out of Ma's bureau drawer.

803
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,659
But that won't do any good.

804
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,369
Hey, what's the matter with you?

805
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:53,020
You scared of those ghosts
they're all talking about?

806
00:53:54,313 --> 00:53:55,791
I guess I made a mistake.

807
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,400
I thought you were a man.

808
00:53:58,317 --> 00:53:59,318
Sorry.

809
00:54:02,029 --> 00:54:03,030
Millie.

810
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:11,181
Millie, I'll go.

811
00:54:11,205 --> 00:54:13,225
Now that's more like it.

812
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:16,169
I knew you were only
kidding, all the time.

813
00:54:19,964 --> 00:54:21,150
All right, boys, break it down.

814
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,401
I hear he's got buck teeth!

815
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,761
I heard
he's got no teeth at all.

816
00:54:26,095 --> 00:54:27,013
Stop, you!

817
00:54:27,054 --> 00:54:28,031
Head him off!

818
00:54:28,055 --> 00:54:29,932
I ain't done nothing, I ain't done!

819
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:36,707
Get him, come on!

820
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:37,732
Get him!

821
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:39,544
Where do you think you're going?

822
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:41,295
Up to Raden House, to
look for the murderer.

823
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,172
You'll do no such a thing.

824
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,590
And I don't want you dragging my daughter

825
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,216
around haunted houses.

826
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,760
If you'd rather we
didn't go, Mrs. Pickens-

827
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,012
- Don't worry, Ma, I'll be perfectly safe.

828
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,204
Paul's got a gun.

829
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,624
A gun?

830
00:54:58,544 --> 00:55:00,022
Can't we just go for a walk?

831
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:03,007
A walk, with 5,000 bucks
up there waiting for us?

832
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,945
You're not afraid at all?

833
00:55:06,969 --> 00:55:10,681
For 5,000, I'm not afraid
of anything, not even death.

834
00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:14,912
Stop him!

835
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,538
I haven't got nothing on me.

836
00:55:16,562 --> 00:55:17,998
Take him out.

837
00:55:18,022 --> 00:55:19,208
- Who was it?
- An old man

838
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,584
with a gray beard.

839
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,461
But I told her not to leave the house.

840
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,028
I know it, Bill, I know it.

841
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,298
That's just what I kept telling
her, but she went anyway.

842
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:27,424
Yeah, with that guy.

843
00:55:27,448 --> 00:55:28,425
Oh, it's the reward.

844
00:55:28,449 --> 00:55:29,551
What do you mean the reward?

845
00:55:29,575 --> 00:55:31,136
Where did she go, did
she run away with him?

846
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,137
Oh, no, they went up

847
00:55:32,161 --> 00:55:33,764
to that haunted Raden House.

848
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:36,016
Yeah, I knew that guy
was out for no good.

849
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,227
Now don't get Mr. Paul wrong, Bill.

850
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,686
He didn't wanna go.

851
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,063
He's a gentleman.

852
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:42,356
But she made him do it.

853
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,650
She twists him right around her finger,

854
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,133
just like she does you.

855
00:55:47,134 --> 00:55:49,238
She's got that reward on her mind.

856
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:51,615
Yeah, well, what do you
think he's got on his mind?

857
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,099
Come on, Tom.

858
00:55:57,937 --> 00:55:59,605
There's the guy, hold him!

859
00:56:02,608 --> 00:56:04,211
Dr. Saunders must know that he can't

860
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:06,630
get away with an insanity
charge against you.

861
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:08,215
What if he does open that grave?

862
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:11,033
The minute they find Paul,
they'll know he's been lying.

863
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,263
Maybe he figures on
finding Paul before the police

864
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:16,080
in order to make sure he disappears.

865
00:56:20,209 --> 00:56:22,855
Darling, what about that
hidden room at Raden House?

866
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,565
He destroyed everything in it.

867
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:25,525
But that was late at night,

868
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,442
and he must've worked very fast.

869
00:56:27,466 --> 00:56:29,194
Maybe he overlooked something.

870
00:56:29,218 --> 00:56:30,279
Maybe there's something there

871
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,030
that you could use as evidence.

872
00:56:32,054 --> 00:56:33,657
It's worth a try.

873
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,617
I'm going there and find out.

874
00:56:35,641 --> 00:56:36,785
Then I'll come with you.

875
00:56:36,809 --> 00:56:40,873
No, you stay here, and, please,

876
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:44,001
don't leave the hotel until
we know Paul has been found.

877
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:48,171
All right.

878
00:56:48,195 --> 00:56:49,214
Please, be careful.

879
00:56:49,238 --> 00:56:50,239
I will.

880
00:57:11,552 --> 00:57:14,281
Millie, let's go back.

881
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,699
What are you scared of?

882
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:16,992
He only chokes people.

883
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,517
We've got a gun.

884
00:57:49,548 --> 00:57:50,758
Get your gun ready.

885
00:58:27,044 --> 00:58:28,045
Be careful!

886
00:58:52,236 --> 00:58:53,237
Turn off the lights.

887
00:59:04,957 --> 00:59:06,727
Well, there's nobody here, let's go.

888
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,061
Whoa, we ain't looked yet.

889
00:59:08,085 --> 00:59:12,089
Yeah, but, well, let's
just look a little easy, huh?

890
00:59:19,638 --> 00:59:21,307
Don't go in there!

891
00:59:22,224 --> 00:59:23,225
Why not?

892
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,855
Because that's my mother's room.

893
00:59:30,107 --> 00:59:32,234
Not in there!

894
00:59:52,671 --> 00:59:53,714
Get him, Bill!

895
00:59:56,675 --> 00:59:59,011
Bill, Bill, get him, he's the murderer!

896
01:00:10,022 --> 01:00:11,023
Get him!

897
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,264
Paul.

898
01:01:00,447 --> 01:01:04,094
Go on, Tom, tell everybody
I've got him, go on!

899
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:05,262
Go on! What are you waiting for,

900
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:06,555
get going!

901
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,098
And he's at Raden House.

902
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,766
They got him, they got
him, my Millie got him!

903
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:12,477
It was that dirty Mr. Paul my new boarder.

904
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:14,628
Come on, they're holding
him up at Raden House.

905
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:17,524
They say he's a stranger in town.

906
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:18,608
Yeah?

907
01:01:18,632 --> 01:01:20,485
They got him!

908
01:01:20,509 --> 01:01:22,529
They say it's John Raden.

909
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:23,780
We oughta string him up.

910
01:01:23,804 --> 01:01:26,283
Yeah, I'll get a rope.

911
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,409
It's John Raden.

912
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:28,994
He seemed so nice, too.

913
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,871
Those still waters are
always the murderers.

914
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:34,190
Imagine the nerve,
right in his own hometown!

915
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:45,844
Most irregular thing I
ever heard of in my life.

916
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,387
I'm telling you, Judge,
this is a terrible mix up.

917
01:01:47,411 --> 01:01:48,638
The fella who caught him says he's a guy

918
01:01:48,662 --> 01:01:51,308
named Paul somebody, but
he says he's John Raden.

919
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:52,143
I don't care who he is.

920
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:53,768
This is the 19th of August.

921
01:01:53,792 --> 01:01:55,437
Court opens the 8th of September.

922
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:56,938
Throw him into jail, I'll try him then.

923
01:01:56,962 --> 01:01:59,357
You'll try him tonight or
you won't try him at all.

924
01:01:59,381 --> 01:02:01,276
Judge, these are pretty hot nights.

925
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,402
Yeah, in this kind of weather,

926
01:02:02,426 --> 01:02:03,778
he won't even keep til September.

927
01:02:03,802 --> 01:02:06,072
There'll be no
violence in Radentown.

928
01:02:06,096 --> 01:02:07,157
That's right.

929
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:09,642
We'll give him a quick trial
so we can hang him legal.

930
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,686
All right, but it's mighty irregular.

931
01:02:14,521 --> 01:02:16,106
Come on, everybody, everybody!

932
01:02:19,276 --> 01:02:21,087
You must come with me now, this minute.

933
01:02:21,111 --> 01:02:24,007
I'm sorry, I have a very
sick patient over in Mavell.

934
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:25,967
Doctor, you can't leave now.

935
01:02:25,991 --> 01:02:27,761
You've got to tell the truth about John.

936
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:29,846
You're the only one who can clear him.

937
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:31,932
If I clear John, it
means the end of everything

938
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:33,415
I've spent years building up.

939
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,020
You're cold, you're heartless.

940
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,396
I'm sorry.

941
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:41,149
Sorry, sorry?

942
01:02:41,173 --> 01:02:42,984
You're deliberately committing a murder,

943
01:02:43,008 --> 01:02:45,094
and all you can say is you're sorry?

944
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:02,921
Quiet or I'll clear the court!

945
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,173
I'll clear the court!

946
01:03:05,197 --> 01:03:07,425
- Order!
- Quiet, quiet!

947
01:03:07,449 --> 01:03:08,635
Proceed, Mr. Oakley.

948
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:10,262
You're out of your minds, all of you!

949
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:15,291
You don't even listen!

950
01:03:15,457 --> 01:03:18,103
Well, I told you
everything, except this.

951
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,939
This John Raden is a mighty powerful man,

952
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,299
but he ain't gonna fool us
into thinking he's insane!

953
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:27,028
He's nothing but a coldblooded murderer.

954
01:03:27,052 --> 01:03:28,488
The only reason he took the name Paul

955
01:03:28,512 --> 01:03:30,740
is so he could pretend to be insane.

956
01:03:30,764 --> 01:03:33,934
There was nothing crazy in him
putting up that cash reward.

957
01:03:34,768 --> 01:03:36,687
He's clever, all right.

958
01:03:37,521 --> 01:03:38,731
Will you stop this idiotic.

959
01:03:41,483 --> 01:03:43,712
And the reason why I'm
sure he's the same man

960
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:45,672
is because he told me he
was gonna open the mills

961
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:47,573
and put everyone back to work.

962
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:49,950
Order, order!

963
01:03:50,909 --> 01:03:52,971
Why did he say, "Don't go in there",

964
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,621
"that's my mother's room"?

965
01:03:57,583 --> 01:04:00,711
You identify this man as the
one who tried to murder you?

966
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:02,897
Yes.

967
01:04:02,921 --> 01:04:05,608
But I tell you, that
was my twin brother.

968
01:04:05,632 --> 01:04:07,610
Ah, he's been dead for 25 years.

969
01:04:07,634 --> 01:04:09,720
Maybe he upped from the grave.

970
01:04:15,684 --> 01:04:16,495
There, did you see?

971
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,871
Did you see that?

972
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:20,123
That's what he done at
the cafe, just like that,

973
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:21,916
with his hands up to his ears.

974
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:22,983
Go on, get him!

975
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:29,740
Quiet, quiet!

976
01:04:31,241 --> 01:04:33,118
This man's going to get a fair trial!

977
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:35,871
Quiet!

978
01:04:38,832 --> 01:04:40,709
Now, we'll hear your side of the case.

979
01:04:43,003 --> 01:04:45,297
- You'll talk, too.
- Start talking.

980
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,306
I know what you people feel about me.

981
01:04:55,557 --> 01:04:58,703
You have every reason to
doubt anything that I may say,

982
01:04:58,727 --> 01:05:00,229
but this is the truth.

983
01:05:01,855 --> 01:05:04,358
All right, I'll take the
blame for what has happened,

984
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,778
but I want to ask you, what
would you have done in my place?

985
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:12,175
My father sent me away
from here when I was a boy.

986
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:15,595
It wasn't until after his
death that I learned the truth.

987
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:18,431
Old Pompey was taking care of my brother.

988
01:05:18,455 --> 01:05:20,433
Paul has lived secretly in the cellar

989
01:05:20,457 --> 01:05:22,560
of this house for 25 years.

990
01:05:22,584 --> 01:05:24,854
He was and is insane!

991
01:05:24,878 --> 01:05:25,689
Well, what about his grave?

992
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:27,482
I remember when he died!

993
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:28,942
Everybody knows he's dead!

994
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:29,860
He is not dead!

995
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:31,820
He is alive and insane!

996
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:34,072
It was he who committed these crimes!

997
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,866
Dr. Saunders knows, find
him, bring him here.

998
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:37,701
He'll tell you.

999
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,643
Here's Doc Saunders now.

1000
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,331
Doc, over here, please.

1001
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:43,665
Please, let me through.

1002
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:44,898
Oh, no, you don't.

1003
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:49,212
Dr. Ben, I knew you'd come.

1004
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:50,362
Tell them about Paul.

1005
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:58,287
Paul, John's brother, is still alive.

1006
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:03,459
I falsified his death
certificate years ago.

1007
01:06:07,087 --> 01:06:09,774
John here has been telling you the truth.

1008
01:06:09,798 --> 01:06:13,278
It's his brother Paul who's
responsible for these murders.

1009
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:14,887
Not John.

1010
01:06:18,098 --> 01:06:19,284
How much you
getting for this, Doc?

1011
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,894
He must think we're
all a bunch of nitwits!

1012
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:26,332
- Quiet, quiet, quiet!
- Quiet yourself.

1013
01:06:26,356 --> 01:06:27,876
I'm not gonna stand here
and listen to him lying

1014
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,318
to save John Raden's neck.

1015
01:06:31,945 --> 01:06:32,988
I'm not lying.

1016
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,841
Now, wait a minute, Doc.

1017
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:36,301
You filed a phony death certificate

1018
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,428
that Pompey kicked off from heart failure.

1019
01:06:38,452 --> 01:06:39,305
What about that?

1020
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:41,205
Yeah, that's
right, what about it?

1021
01:06:43,707 --> 01:06:45,727
See, he's not opening his trap!

1022
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:48,795
Why don't you tell us that
Peggy Nolan committed suicide?

1023
01:06:57,763 --> 01:06:59,449
Out the window.

1024
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:00,891
Let's go get him!

1025
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:04,871
Get out to the roads
and surround the place.

1026
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:06,021
There he goes!

1027
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:09,543
I guess you want me, don't you, Andy?
