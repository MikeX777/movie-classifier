wanted me to join up

- or anything, but...
- Mm-hm.

to do something good

else it is I'm gonna do.

I didn't.

126
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:05,057
I just wound up
fucking around and...

127
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:09,759
And not really doing
much of anything.

128
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:11,760
So why'd you join up?

129
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:13,262
Thing to do. I don't
know if it felt like

130
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:15,731
a good thing, but...

- Which base is it, again? Can I come see you?
- I don't know.

139
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:39,154
I don't know if they let us
have visitors at the base,

140
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:41,690
so I gotta find out.

141
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:44,995
- Well, I'd love to come.
- Yeah.

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,980
Go get some clippers before
you waste one of my razors.

158
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:39,184
[Bartle] That's
what I told him.

159

never shaved before?

No, sir.

Look, you guys are
my guys, right?

168

I ain't supposed to be
telling anyone this,

So starting now, you guys have
to promise to do what I say.

176
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:22,858
[Murph] Yeah,

No, fuck that.

178
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:25,195
Don't give me that shit.

179
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,097
No sure thing this time.

180
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:29,031
Promise you'll do what I
say every fucking time.

00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:42,218
[Lieutenant] Sir...

362
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,286
You tell me.

363
00:18:44,288 --> 00:18:45,857
Your mic's on, so
whenever you're ready, sir.

364
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,294
Gentlemen, this
is the final push.

365
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,795
We're gonna drop
fire in this rat hole

366
00:18:52,797 --> 00:18:55,765
for the next two
hours until dawn.

367
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,400
We'll still be shredding
those palm trees

368
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,238
when you get to them.

369
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:02,438
We'll take this city.

370
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,209
Once we do, the insurgency
will die on the vine.

371
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:10,345
I know not all of you read the
Bible, but those that do...

372
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:15,218
You know, this is the land
where Jonah was buried,

373
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,321
where he begged God's
justice to come.

374
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,921
And we are...

375
00:19:19,923 --> 00:19:22,557
We are that justice.

376
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,830
Right now, as of this moment...

377
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:31,901
This is the most important
day of your lives.

378
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:34,439
[guns firing]

379
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,840
You really think this is
the most important thing

380
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:39,307
you'll ever do?

381
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:40,546
I don't know.

388
00:20:22,686 --> 00:20:23,919
[Bartle] What? What?

389
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:25,755
[Tess] I have a leg cramp.

390
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:26,792
Okay.

391
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:30,058
You okay?

392
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,295
I'm good.

393
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:37,799
[Bartle] Tess, Tess, Tess,
Tess, Tess, Tess, Tess, Tess...

394
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:39,869
[Tess] Stop that.

395

[Bartle] Tess, Tess, Tess,
Tess, Tess, Tess, Tess, Tess...

396
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:42,938
Shut up!

397
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,073
[Bartle] What?

398
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:45,507
[Tess] I hate that.

399
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:46,976
[Bartle] You hate your name?

400
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:49,378
[Tess] I hate
when you do that.

401
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,578
[Bartle] You know,
if I say it enough,

402
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,780
it stops meaning anything.

403
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:54,583
All I've got left is you.

404
00:20:54,585 --> 00:20:56,584
Same thing with your name.

405
00:20:56,586 --> 00:20:59,322
[Bartle] No, I got syllables.

406
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:03,625

[Sterling] It's from Judges.

547
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:05,964

551
00:31:26,717 --> 00:31:29,084
[Anderson] Ms. Bartle?

552
00:31:29,086 --> 00:31:30,619
Is Brandon home?

553
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:33,287
- He's out.
- Oh, that's too bad.

554
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:36,324
Any idea where?
I know the area pretty well.

555
00:31:36,326 --> 00:31:39,161
Listen, whatever you're selling,
mister, we don't want any.

556
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,129
- No, pardon, uh...
- You had him all ready.

557
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:43,265
You don't get to take him
again, you understand?

558
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:46,267
Oh, I'm not a recruiter or
anything like that, Ms. Bartle.

559
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:48,103
I'm one of the good guys.

560
00:31:48,105 --> 00:31:49,671
Says who?

561
00:31:49,673 --> 00:31:51,305
I'm just following
up on a few things

562
00:31:51,307 --> 00:31:53,443
from Brandon's last post.

563
00:31:54,744 --> 00:31:56,311
I have a few questions for him.

564
00:31:56,313 --> 00:31:58,212
It's routine, more or less.

565
00:31:58,214 --> 00:32:00,449
Well, he's not here.

566
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:01,482
Yeah, you said that.

567
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:03,517
[Amy] Mm-hm.

568
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,089
Would you mind if I
ask you a few things?

569
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:12,096
Has your son ever mentioned
the name Daniel Murphy?

570
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,198
Garrett Sterling, perhaps?

571
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,766
We haven't talked much.

572
00:32:17,768 --> 00:32:19,267
Hm.

573
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:21,236
Right.

574
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:23,471
Well...

575
00:32:23,473 --> 00:32:25,175
When you do see Brandon, will
you give him this for me?

576
00:32:30,646 --> 00:32:32,082
Thank you, ma'am.

577
00:32:35,251 --> 00:32:37,451
And what'd you
people do to him?

578
00:32:37,453 --> 00:32:39,621
He won't get out of bed.
He don't care about nothing.

579
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:42,324
It's like he doesn't know
where he is half the time.

580
00:32:42,326 --> 00:32:44,659
- [Anderson] I understand.
- Do you?!

581
00:32:44,661 --> 00:32:46,661
You got kids?!

582
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:47,966
About half a million.

583
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,501
That's not even
counting reserves.

584
00:32:52,435 --> 00:32:53,503
Yeah?

585
00:32:55,138 --> 00:32:57,507
Well, I've just got the one.

586
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:09,754
[Bartle] Thanks, Ma.

587
00:33:13,323 --> 00:33:15,426
CID, what is that?

588
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:19,463
Criminal
Investigation Division.

589
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,832
Jesus.

590
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:26,104
What happened over there?

591
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,241
[phone bleeping]

592
00:33:34,243 --> 00:33:37,211
[woman talking on phone]

593
00:33:37,213 --> 00:33:38,680
[Bartle] Yeah, I'm trying

594
00:33:38,682 --> 00:33:41,115
to reach Staff
Sergeant Sterling.

595
00:33:41,117 --> 00:33:44,853
[woman talking on phone]

596
00:33:44,855 --> 00:33:46,755
[Bartle] Right, yeah.

597
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:49,727
[woman talking on phone]

598
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,763
No, no, no, I'm
just a friend of him,

599
00:33:54,765 --> 00:33:56,363
just served with him,
I was just wondering

600
00:33:56,365 --> 00:33:57,665
what he's up to, is all.

601
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:59,069
No, I can...

602
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:01,268
Yeah, thank you.

603
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,440
No, I...

604
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:07,109
I might call back sometime.

605
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:08,146
Yeah, thanks.

610
00:34:36,706 --> 00:34:38,175
Not like home.

611
00:34:39,342 --> 00:34:41,478
[Sterling] Fuck home.

612
00:34:43,246 --> 00:34:44,545
Keep thinking about
home, you end up there

613
00:34:44,547 --> 00:34:45,649
with a flag shoved up your ass.

614
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:48,849
Jesus Christ, get your mind out

615
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:50,452
of your girlfriend's
pussy, Bartle.

616
00:34:50,454 --> 00:34:52,354
Don't have a
girlfriend, Sarge.

617
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,822
[Sterling] Yeah, sure you do,

618
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,258
or you wouldn't
say it like that.

619
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,626
I don't, or at least
I don't think I do.

620
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:02,229
She's going to school, so I
figured the best thing was...

621
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:04,166
Well, you know.

622
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,666
[Sterling] She
dropped you then?

623
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:07,869
[Bartle] What?

624
00:35:07,871 --> 00:35:09,371
No.

625
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,704
[Sterling] I'd kill the bitch.

626
00:35:10,706 --> 00:35:13,474
[Murph laughs]

627
00:35:13,476 --> 00:35:16,311
What the heck you
cackling about, Murphy?

628
00:35:16,313 --> 00:35:18,215
Everything's just
so goddamn funny, sir.

Bran?

632
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:35,764
Bran.

633
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,168
Phone for you.

634
00:35:38,268 --> 00:35:39,333
[Bartle] Who?

635
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:40,737
[Amy] It's Tess.

636
00:35:41,871 --> 00:35:43,572
[Bartle] I'm not here.

637
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:44,805
She and Luke and
the gang are going

638
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:45,907
to the river on the weekend.

639
00:35:45,909 --> 00:35:47,876
They want you to go.

640
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:49,344
[Bartle] Okay.

641
00:35:49,346 --> 00:35:50,878
What should I tell her then?

642
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,481
[Bartle] That
I'll call her back.

643
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:56,584
So should I tell
her you're not coming?

644
00:35:56,586 --> 00:35:59,653
Just tell her
whatever you want.

645
00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:02,557
Hey.
Your friends wanna see you.

646
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:05,492
[Bartle] I'm not the one
who told them I was back, Ma.

647
00:36:05,494 --> 00:36:06,728
It's not like it's
a secret, honey.

648
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,630
Everyone knows you're home.

649
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:10,432
It'll be good for you.

650
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:12,601
Ma, please, just get
the fuck out of my room.

651
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:13,637
Okay?

- You don't get to stay

656
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:30,485
- Fuck!
- I can't take this.

00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,554
Talk to me!

00:36:33,556 --> 00:36:35,757
Listen to me.

660
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:39,494
Let me fucking sleep, okay?!

661
00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:40,530

728
00:42:44,693 --> 00:42:47,161
You're doing great,
just stay still.

729
00:42:47,163 --> 00:42:48,197
You okay?

730
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:50,800
Lay back for me.

731
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,170
Lay back for me.

732
00:42:56,172 --> 00:42:57,574
Just lay back.

733
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,081
Ooh, it's almost over.

734
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:08,117
Good.

735
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:12,089
Okay.

736
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,693
Okay, you're almost done.

737
00:43:22,164 --> 00:43:23,164
[Murph sobs]

738
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:24,234
Hey.

739
00:43:25,268 --> 00:43:26,336
Hey, calm down.

740
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:30,204
Breathe, just breathe.

741
00:43:30,206 --> 00:43:33,307
[Murph sobs]

742
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:34,909
You're okay,
soldier, you're okay.

[helicopter humming]

745
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:42,983
[Man] We got Woodward.

746
00:43:42,985 --> 00:43:44,754
[Woodward] Yes, sir.

747
00:43:45,954 --> 00:43:47,688
[Man] We got Scotts.

748
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,725
Scotts?!

749
00:43:50,393 --> 00:43:52,059
Murphy!

750
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:54,028
Murphy!

751
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,197
Private Murphy!

752
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:58,066
- Murphy, no Murphy?
- Just to come on back.

[helicopter humming]

754
00:44:10,947 --> 00:44:13,947
And as John did for Jesus...

755
00:44:13,949 --> 00:44:15,916
Let us wash it
away, wash it away.

756
00:44:15,918 --> 00:44:19,454
For unless you are born of
the water and the Spirit,

757
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:23,023
you cannot enter
the kingdom of God.

758
00:44:23,025 --> 00:44:25,159
Private Whitaker, do you
take the Lord Jesus Christ

759
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:26,360
as your savior?

760
00:44:26,362 --> 00:44:28,195
[Whitaker] <i>Yes, sir!</i>

761
00:44:28,197 --> 00:44:29,963
Then I baptize you in
the name of the Father

762
00:44:29,965 --> 00:44:31,432
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

763
00:44:31,434 --> 00:44:32,867
Amen, amen.

764
00:44:32,869 --> 00:44:34,836
[Group of Soldiers] Amen!

767
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:56,324
Hey, Bartle.

768
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:57,358
[Bartle] Hey, man.

769
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,959
Where you been?

770
00:44:58,961 --> 00:45:00,197
I've been here.

771
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,197
Your mom wrote.

772
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:04,233
Thanks.

773
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,173
You okay, man?

774
00:45:12,175 --> 00:45:15,309
[helicopter humming]

775
00:45:15,311 --> 00:45:16,346
Yeah.

776
00:45:17,413 --> 00:45:20,014
[people murmuring]

777
00:45:20,016 --> 00:45:21,414
You looking at that girl?

778
00:45:21,416 --> 00:45:23,885
[helicopter humming]

779
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:24,922
For how long?

780
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:28,356
I've been coming
up here every day.

781
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,023
Mm!

782
00:45:30,025 --> 00:45:31,291
Every day?

783
00:45:31,293 --> 00:45:33,427
She know you're stalking her?

784
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:34,528
Probably.

785
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:36,963
[helicopter humming]

786
00:45:36,965 --> 00:45:38,800
[Bartle] You talk to her yet?

787
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:39,934
No.

788
00:45:39,936 --> 00:45:40,971
I just watch.

789
00:45:42,871 --> 00:45:45,405
See how she talks to them
on the way in like that?

790
00:45:45,407 --> 00:45:48,008
She always does that.

791
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,543
Yeah? Just get yourself
like a fucking

792
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:51,311
whooping cough or something

793
00:45:51,313 --> 00:45:53,280
and get her to take
another look at you.

794
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:55,282
Hey, what's it called
when the doctor

795
00:45:55,284 --> 00:45:58,952
makes you take your pants
down and asks you to cough?

796
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:00,588
You know what I mean?

797
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:03,925
Fuck, dude, they could
send you home maybe.

798
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,864
[helicopter humming]

799
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:14,001
They should just bomb
this place off the face

800
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:15,336
of the earth.

801
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:18,139
I hate it so much.

802
00:46:18,141 --> 00:46:20,844
Yeah. Some fucking garden
of Eden, right?

803
00:46:22,878 --> 00:46:26,884
I'm never gonna tell anybody
I was here when I get back.

804
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:31,117
When I get back, I just...

805
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,588
I'm gonna get a place to myself.

806
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:38,092
I'm not gonna go no place
and not talk to anybody.

807
00:46:38,094 --> 00:46:42,499
Wake up every morning
and go run, eat right...

808
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:46,336
And let my fucking
hair grow back out.

809
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:51,072
[deep breath]

810
00:46:51,074 --> 00:46:54,575
I might show up, and
if somebody says,

811
00:46:54,577 --> 00:46:56,177
"Hey, Murph, didn't
you used to be

812
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:58,012
"in the Army or something?"

813
00:46:58,014 --> 00:47:02,316
And I'll just say, "That
was something I did

814
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:04,651
"for a little while."

815
00:47:04,653 --> 00:47:05,887
Or maybe I won't even say that.

816
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:06,923
Maybe...

817
00:47:13,028 --> 00:47:15,965
I don't want this
to be a part of me.

818
00:47:17,132 --> 00:47:20,469
[soft instrumental music]

819
00:47:32,481 --> 00:47:34,048
All right, dude, let's
fucking get outta here.

820
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,048
Come on.

821
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,284
Come on.

822
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:37,450
I'm gonna stay here, man.

823
00:47:37,452 --> 00:47:38,653
No, come on, there...

824
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:40,387
Dude, let's go, seriously.

825
00:47:40,389 --> 00:47:42,188
Come on.

Is...

838
00:49:47,115 --> 00:49:49,617
Are you Brandon's mom?

839
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:50,653
Amy, right?

840
00:49:52,655 --> 00:49:54,121
And who are you?

841
00:49:54,123 --> 00:49:55,322
Maureen.

842
00:49:55,324 --> 00:49:57,226
My name's Maureen Murphy.

843
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:01,097
My son served with your son.

844
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:03,130
Did he?

845
00:50:03,132 --> 00:50:05,099
[Maureen] Mm-hm.

846
00:50:05,101 --> 00:50:08,769
Let me ask you, did your
boy come back an asshole, too?

847
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:11,008
He didn't come back.

848
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:15,675
- Oh, oh, my God.
- He's missing.

849
00:50:15,677 --> 00:50:17,380
They don't know yet.

850
00:50:18,547 --> 00:50:19,813
I am so sorry.

851
00:50:19,815 --> 00:50:21,148
Here.

852
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,416
Why don't you come in?

853
00:50:22,418 --> 00:50:24,452
[Maureen] Thank you.

854
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,353
[Amy] Is there
something I can get you?

855
00:50:26,355 --> 00:50:28,222
No, I'm fine.

856
00:50:28,224 --> 00:50:29,490
I just wanna talk to Brandon.

857
00:50:29,492 --> 00:50:30,627
It'd be nice to see him again.

858
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,360
You met him before?

859
00:50:34,362 --> 00:50:35,628
Once, yeah, I did.

860
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:38,134
There was a party at the base.

861
00:50:40,469 --> 00:50:45,206
Well, I don't know when
Bran's gonna be home.

862
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,441
Well, would you mind
if I just wait a while?

863
00:50:48,443 --> 00:50:50,411
I just have some...

864
00:50:50,413 --> 00:50:52,782
I wanna ask him some things.

865
00:50:54,182 --> 00:50:56,052
I just wanna know what happened.

866
00:50:58,521 --> 00:51:01,688
These people, they're
not telling me anything,

867
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:06,559
and I'm just sorting
it all out myself.

868
00:51:06,561 --> 00:51:10,563
You know, I don't know how
somebody just goes missing.

869
00:51:10,565 --> 00:51:12,398
I just don't.

870
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,135
And I just wanna know if was...

871
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,903
[glass breaking]

872
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:17,804
- Oh, my, I'm so sorry!
- I'll get that, it's okay.

873
00:51:17,806 --> 00:51:18,805
[Maureen] Please, will you...

874
00:51:18,807 --> 00:51:20,240
Oh, gosh!

875
00:51:20,242 --> 00:51:22,278
[Amy] Oh, oh, okay, hold on.

876
00:51:26,248 --> 00:51:27,680
Oh, God.

877
00:51:27,682 --> 00:51:29,782
[Maureen] Here.

878
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:32,489
I'm just a mess, I'm just...

879
00:51:37,326 --> 00:51:39,695
I really just wish
I didn't let him go.

880
00:51:41,697 --> 00:51:44,264
- I know. Come here.
- [moaning]

881
00:51:44,266 --> 00:51:45,301

00:54:02,471 --> 00:54:04,737
[Luke] Jesus! Set him down.

894
00:54:04,739 --> 00:54:05,938
- [Tess] No, I don't know.
- Bartle!

895
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,807
Hey, Bartle!

896
00:54:07,809 --> 00:54:09,909
[Tess] No, we just pulled
him out of the water.

897
00:54:09,911 --> 00:54:11,077
- Come on, buddy!
- Off the road. By the underpass.

898
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:12,545
[Luke] Wake up, buddy!

899
00:54:12,547 --> 00:54:14,347
I think he's waking up now.

900
00:54:14,349 --> 00:54:16,516
[Luke] He's up.

901
00:54:16,518 --> 00:54:17,918
You all right?

902
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,820

Yeah, no, I'm good.

903
00:54:20,822 --> 00:54:22,692
- Come on.
- I'm good.

904
00:54:26,594 --> 00:54:28,494
We heard a noise.

905
00:54:28,496 --> 00:54:30,532
So we ran over.

906
00:54:31,634 --> 00:54:32,633

My friend told me
something the other day.

She said, "Maureen, you gotta
find your truth in all this."

know, smell you on it</i>

01:25:09,603 --> 01:25:10,835
Will you...

1270
01:25:10,837 --> 01:25:12,336
Yeah.

1271
01:25:12,338 --> 01:25:13,638
Just tell me where it happened

1272
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:16,741
just so I kind of have an idea?

1273
01:25:16,743 --> 01:25:19,447
No, that's not silly at all.

1274
01:25:24,284 --> 01:25:26,451
We found him here.

1275
01:25:26,453 --> 01:25:28,387
Right about...

1276
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:29,888
Here.

1277
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:32,660
And we carried him
to the water here.

1278
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:37,398
And then we just let him go.

1279
01:25:39,365 --> 01:25:42,334
Right about here it
opens up into the gulf,

1280
01:25:42,336 --> 01:25:45,539
and I guess that's
where he stopped.

1281
01:25:53,346 --> 01:25:55,382
Or kept going, you know.

1282
01:25:57,685 --> 01:26:00,384
There's nothing to
stop you out there, no.

1283
01:26:00,386 --> 01:26:03,921
Nothing to get in your way
when you look out at it all.

1284

No trees, just...

1285

Sky and water, and
after a while you...

1286
01:26:10,463 --> 01:26:13,268
Can't tell one from the other.

1287
01:26:14,534 --> 01:26:18,402
There's nothing to shield you.

1288
01:26:18,404 --> 01:26:22,509
There's nothing to keep you
from just taking it all in.

1289
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:28,582
That's where he is now.

01:26:32,552 --> 01:26:34,620

Ma'am?

1293
01:27:01,814 --> 01:27:04,451
Was he ever happy over there?

1294
01:27:07,453 --> 01:27:08,722
Sure.

1295
01:27:11,524 --> 01:27:13,527
Why don't you
tell me about that?

1296
01:27:17,730 --> 01:27:19,266
Well...

1297
01:27:23,337 --> 01:27:26,470
There was this girl he liked.

1298
01:27:26,472 --> 01:27:28,607
And, um...

1299
01:27:28,609 --> 01:27:30,308
I don't know if she
ever even knew his name,

1300
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:32,779
but he liked her.

1301
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:39,550
One time, this wasn't that
long ago, there was a party.

1302
01:27:39,552 --> 01:27:42,420
It was a Christmas party.

1303
01:27:42,422 --> 01:27:43,757
And, um...

1304
01:27:44,925 --> 01:27:47,459
And that girl was there...

1305
01:27:47,461 --> 01:27:54,433
And he was too shy
to go dance with her.

1306
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:57,501
And I kept trying to get
him to go talk to her.

1307
01:27:57,503 --> 01:28:00,472
He kept saying, "No, no, no."

1308
01:28:00,474 --> 01:28:01,676
And...

1309
01:28:04,978 --> 01:28:08,446
And then she came up to him.

1310
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:12,386
And she made him get out
there and start moving.

1311
01:28:14,654 --> 01:28:17,455
And he wasn't that good.

1312

[chuckles]

1313
01:28:18,992 --> 01:28:22,561
But he wasn't that bad, either.

1314
01:28:22,563 --> 01:28:25,432
And he was laughing
and smiling...

1315
01:28:26,734 --> 01:28:28,866
And having a real good time.
