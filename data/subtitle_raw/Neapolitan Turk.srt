8
00:01:29,127 --> 00:01:32,722

this play by Scarpetta.

9
00:01:32,767 --> 00:01:34,837
360 performances.

10
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,878
"Dress circle 3 liras,
stalls 1.80 liras. "

11
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:40,485
Prices are getting out of hand!

12
00:01:47,127 --> 00:01:49,277
Amalia, it's late, you know.

13
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:51,158
How are you?

14
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:53,084
- Fine, and you?
- Not too bad.

15
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:57,286
Pasquale, wait for me
in the usual place.

16
00:01:57,647 --> 00:02:00,161
- Shall we go?
- Just a moment. Vincenzo,

17
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:03,119
...go and pick up the tickets.
- It's already late.

18
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:06,324
Is it true what they say,
that it's a risque show?

19
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:09,439
- Why, are you afraid for...?
- Not for me, for Vincenzo.

20
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:12,724
- Vincenzo? How old is he?
- He's 24.

21
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:15,281
He'll certainly have a lot of
experience of these things!

22
00:02:15,327 --> 00:02:17,716
- That may well be, but...
- Didn't you read the playbill?

23
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:20,201
"French-style farce".
A light comedy!

24
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:24,763
It's a play to make you laugh,
and laughter chases troubles away.

25
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:27,157
Maybe you're right.

26
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:29,960
Any subject is acceptable when
we can joke about it!

27
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:32,043
- Then you agree! Shall we go?
- Yes, let's go.

28
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:34,396
The show's about to start!

29
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:54,239
- Go on! Keep moving!
- Don't be so rough!

30
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:56,762
You're a vulgar ruffian!
I'll teach you manners!

31
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:00,917
Have another laugh
about the style of my hat.!

32
00:03:01,207 --> 00:03:04,916
Excuse me for entering
without knocking.

33
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:07,242
When you're dealing with ruffians
of that kind, you must be patient.

34
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,960
- Let me have a look at you..
- Me?

35
00:03:11,647 --> 00:03:13,558
- Why? What's the matter?
- Are you new?

36
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:15,916
Actually, I've already been used
a few times but it doesn't show.

37
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:19,482
I meant is it the first time
you've been here?

38
00:03:19,527 --> 00:03:23,076
Yes, it's the first time. People
often said I should go to jail..

39
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:25,800
I kept putting it off,
but now I'm here.

40
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:28,566
May I introduce myself?
Faina, pickpocket.

41
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:31,337
Pleased to meet you.
Felice, womanizer.

42
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:33,799
I hurt you, didn't I?

43
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,919
- My goodness, how strong you are!
- I'm a man of steel.

44
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:41,597
That's why I'm a womanizer.
Women love strong men like me.

45
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:45,121
To look at you, one wouldn't
think you're so strong.

46
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:48,557
I know. It's because the force
in me is well hidden.

47
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:51,799
I only look weak..
My hands are like vices..

48
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:54,759
Every time I touch myself I do
damage and come up in bruises.

49
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:58,484
- Why are you here?
- Why am I here?

50
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:02,362
Because despite my brute force,
my very manly force,

51
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:06,844
I actually have a soft heart,
a very tender heart, you see?

52
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:12,246
Would you imprison
a poor father of 5 children for...

53
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:16,644
throwing from the 5th floor a loan
shark who was blackmailing him?

54
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:20,719
- Would you send him to jail?
- I most certainly wouldn't.

55
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:23,475
See what I mean?
Neither would I.

56
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:26,564
I confessed to the crime in his
stead. I left him free.

57
00:04:26,607 --> 00:04:29,121
I let him stay with his family.

58
00:04:30,087 --> 00:04:33,557
Right now, I've nothing to do.
I'm free.

59
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,724
Sure, the ladies will miss me.

60
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:39,645
I'll make up for it when I get out.

61
00:04:39,687 --> 00:04:41,837
I can imagine.

62
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:44,481
- Who's that? Not a thief?
- No, don't worry.

63
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:47,121
It's the waiter
who brings us dinner.

64
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:49,044
Here's the waiter.

65
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,521
Is this the time
to bring us dinner?

66
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:53,876
Is this the time?

67
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:55,918
- This is dinner time.
- Dinner time.

68
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:57,958
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

69
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,282
If you don't give me a menu,
how can I tell you what I want?

70
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:02,841
- Everyone gets this soup.
- Give it here.

71
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:05,481
I trust you're not expecting
a fat tip!

72
00:05:05,527 --> 00:05:08,997
If anyone comes looking for me,
I'm not at home.

73
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:14,802
Listen! I'll correct that!
If a pretty girl turns up,

74
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,680
send her on in!

75
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:20,082
- Is there a private booth in here?
- Sure!

76
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:21,958
Maybe you could keep out of
the way for a while. Listen!

77
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:24,202
- What do you want?
- Give my regards to your sister!

78
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:29,959
What appalling service!

79
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:33,279
And what food! It's terrible.

80
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:35,477
- It's delicious!
- It's lousy!

81
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:38,042
This isn't a good advertisement
for the management here.

82
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,555
If they're expecting me to come
back they've another think coming.

83
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:43,280
I'd rather sleep
under a bridge.

84
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:45,883
I see you've a healthy
appetite, huh?

85
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:48,395
- I'm starving.
- Do you want mine too?

86
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:52,557
- Thanks.
- Here!

87
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:56,316
I always say you find decent
folk only in prison.

88
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:58,835
I can't stand wobbly stools.

89
00:06:04,727 --> 00:06:06,797
I'll even off the legs.

90
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:11,279
It's hard wood... there!

91
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:14,724
- You're incredibly strong!
- I told you so, didn't I?

92
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:17,845
I'm gifted with
a Herculean strength.

93
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:21,603
Listen, do you think you could
bend those bars?

94
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,558
- Which ones?
- The ones on the window.

95
00:06:23,607 --> 00:06:26,565
Those?
A piece of cake!

96
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:30,323
Just think! Once, to remind
myself where my house was,

97
00:06:30,367 --> 00:06:33,996
- I tied a knot in a lamppost.
- There, we're home and dry.

98
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:36,636
- Why do you say that?
- Because if you bend the bars

99
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,201
I have the rope to let ourselves
down with. It's hidden under there.

100
00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:42,125
What is it you want to do? Escape?
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

101
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,964
- Why should I be?
- Because it would be disloyal!

102
00:06:44,007 --> 00:06:46,043
- How?
- We're guests. We'd look bad.

103
00:06:46,087 --> 00:06:48,601
- It's this one here-
- This one?

104
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:50,478
- Who's that?
- The guard.

105
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:52,483
- I heard two voices.
- Then they must be two guards.

106
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:54,563
- Do you think so?
- Two voices, two guards,

107
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:56,484
four voices means
four guards.

108
00:06:57,847 --> 00:06:59,246
Come in. Who is it?

109
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,478
- Which of the two is it?
- This one.

110
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:04,916
Do you have pen and paper?

111
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,685
- No.
- I'll give you what you need.

112
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,479
I'll take the measurements
and you write them down.

113
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:12,478
- What's he writing?
- The numbers.

114
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:14,483
- The what?
- The numbers.

115
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:16,836
Really? Got that?
Tomorrow, we'll play the lottery.

116
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:18,764
We'll fill in the form together.

117
00:07:18,807 --> 00:07:21,241
You misunderstood.
He's writing the measurements.

118
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:24,359
Oh, it's the tailor!
I'm getting a new suit!

119
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:26,796
-65.
-65!

120
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:31,398
Make sure the shoulders are on the
wide side. I'd like them padded,

121
00:07:31,487 --> 00:07:34,718
...while the waist's to be nipped in.
- Short waisted?

122
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:37,327
Don't worry. I have an excellent
model. I'll make it straight down.

123
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:41,679
English-style. I'd like the lining
to be strong.

124
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:44,281
- We'll use zinc.
- Zinc?

125
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:47,046
- Which fabric contains zinc?
- Zinc is a metal!

126
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:49,476
Oh, you mean zinc-colored.
OK, that's fine.

127
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:52,724
-35.
- My good man, I want my shoes...

128
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:55,600
...wide inside and narrow
outside.

129
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,799
My feet aren't what
you'd call perfect.

130
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:02,846
- Don't forget, now.
- Have no fear.

131
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:06,118
No one's ever come back
to complain about my work.

132
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:09,364
I can imagine. This man must be
a very skilful craftsman.

133
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,398
Thanks a million and
goodbye.

134
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:14,484
Goodbye? Farewell.
Let's go.

135
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:21,203
I don't understand. I say
"goodbye" and he says "farewell"?

136
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,885
When will he do
the first fitting?

137
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:24,565
The first fitting?
Then you didn't get it.

138
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:27,201
- What kind of a tailor is he?
- He's no tailor.

139
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:29,198
- Then what is he?
- A carpenter.

140
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:30,919
What measurements did he take?

141
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:33,845
- The ones for your casket.
- For my casket?!

142
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:36,959
It's no time to joke. I'm here
just as a favor. I confessed...

143
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:39,475
to a murder I didn't commit
simply out of kindness.

144
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:41,518
- And they sentenced you to death.
- Oh, no, not to death.

145
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,478
- Oh, yes.
- I won't accept it.

146
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:45,563
- What do you mean?
- I mean I won't accept it.

147
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:47,563
- It's the law.
- Do you still have that rope?

148
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:49,484
- I sure do.
- Do you have the rope?

149
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:51,518
- Are we escaping?
- Yes we are.

150
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:58,082
- Here!.
- Eh, no...

151
00:08:58,487 --> 00:09:01,320
- It's dark! Let's put it off.
- Why?

152
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:03,358
Because it's nighttime.
We'll escape in the morning.

153
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:05,477
- No! At night...
- It's not possible.

154
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:07,483
I'm not thinking of me but
of my reputation. We'll be seen.

155
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:09,722
- What's that got to do with it?
- Would you like word to get out?

156
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:13,123
They'd see us and say:
"Those two did a moonlight flit!"

157
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:15,522
Would you like to be accused
of fleeing like a coward?

158
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:18,718
No, I wouldn't. I'd rather
not to have to flee!

159
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,519
I get it.

160
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:22,683
You prefer to end up in
your casket.

161
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:25,685
Not in my casket, no!
I'd prefer to end up outside.

162
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:27,922
A free man!

163
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:30,083
- See if you can do it.
- Very well.

164
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:32,921
- Just a moment.
- I can manage.

165
00:09:32,967 --> 00:09:36,198
- Let's see if the rope's enough.
- It's very soft metal.

166
00:09:36,247 --> 00:09:39,523
Fine! I hope I made
the rope long enough.

167
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,836
- Let's see if it reaches the ground
- Right! Let's see.

168
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,644
Does it?

169
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:53,843
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

170
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:55,998
I'm bringing this suit
to the warden.

171
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:57,685
And you're waiting for him
out here?

172
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:59,797
No, he told me
he'd throw down a rope.

173
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:02,680
- There it is That's the cord!
- Oh, there it is. Help her.

174
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:05,002
Help this pretty young lady.

175
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:08,323
Make a firm knot,
as if it were a love knot

176
00:10:08,447 --> 00:10:11,484
- There!.
- Pull it tight.

177
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,677
- Pull it tight!
- There we are.

178
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:18,481
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

179
00:10:18,647 --> 00:10:20,603
At your service!

180
00:10:23,047 --> 00:10:25,607
Goodness! What's this?

181
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:27,478
- A civilian suit.
- How did it get here?

182
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:30,166
- Do you know anyone in the area?
- Yes, I've a lot of friends here.

183
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:33,404
- Do they know you want to escape?
- They've known for a while..

184
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:34,562
Someone knew for sure and
prepared you a suit.

185
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:37,326
- Fate is on our side!
- Put it on immediately.

186
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:38,766
A tie, a shirt...
There's everything you need.

187
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,596
Come, otherwise we'll be late
this evening...

188
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,565
Look what's over there!

189
00:10:45,607 --> 00:10:47,484
- What is it?
- Come with me.

190
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:55,079
- But it's only a rope.
- No, it's an escape route.!

191
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:58,000
- Shall I raise the alarm?
- No, let's pull it down.

192
00:10:58,047 --> 00:11:02,199
Pull! Pull! Come on

193
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:05,517
Another pull and we'll make it.

194
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:09,118
It must be stuck! Pull!

195
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,876
One more try. Pull!

196
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,879
- How about it? Shall we help them?
- Yes, let's help them.

197
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:21,483
- Excuse us.
- What's up?

198
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:23,563
- Do you want a hand?
- Thanks.

199
00:11:26,647 --> 00:11:28,558
Warden!

200
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:32,196
- Warden...
- Are you all right?

201
00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:35,956
It's the Warden. He should have
taken the stairs.

202
00:11:36,007 --> 00:11:37,599
He certainly should.

203
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:41,003
You idiots!
I'll have you arrested.

204
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:44,405
He must be a bit annoyed
about coming down so fast.

205
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:46,677
- I would be too.
- Let's get out of here.

206
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:51,840
Chin up, Warden.
We're suffering with you.

207
00:11:51,967 --> 00:11:56,483
My dear friends, here we are.
We're back!

208
00:11:56,687 --> 00:11:59,645
- How are you doing?
- How are you?

209
00:11:59,687 --> 00:12:02,918
- What a great surprise!
- I escaped again.

210
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:05,959
Hello, darling!

211
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:08,237
Hello, Don Pepe!

212
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:10,482
You know lots of people.

213
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:12,518
I'm popular around here..

214
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:15,001
- What are you doing?
- We're going into my house.

215
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:17,083
- You live near the prison?
- Yes, I live here.

216
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:19,886
I see.
A home from home!

217
00:12:19,927 --> 00:12:21,963
Right, to cut down
on traveling.

218
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:26,683
Excuse me. Do you know where
the Sorrento bus leaves from?

219
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:29,036
- Shall we tell him?
- Yes, let's tell him.

220
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:31,726
- Thanks. Where from?
- You're a grown man...

221
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:35,157
...and can't find the bus stop?
- I'm a stranger here.

222
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:39,678
A stranger?
Wait... you're... American!

223
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:42,082
- No, Turkish.
- Yet...

224
00:12:42,327 --> 00:12:45,046
...I once met an American
who swore he was a foreigner.

225
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:47,203
Well done!

226
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:49,556
Felice, be careful!
Don't be rough!

227
00:12:49,607 --> 00:12:52,167
- I just placed my hand on him.
- You'll get over it.

228
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:54,277
- Listen, are you a foreigner?
- Yes, I am..

229
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:57,478
- Is this your first visit here?
- Yes, I just got off the boat.

230
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:00,203
- And you don't know anyone here?
- No, no one.

231
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,920
Come in and I'll explain
everything to you. Come!.

232
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,401
- No, I just want to know...
- Ask him..

233
00:13:05,447 --> 00:13:07,756
- Where does the bus leave from?
- He knows more about these things.

234
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:11,436
Hs brother-in-law is a tram driver.
He'll know. Enter! Go in!

235
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:14,238
Come on in!

236
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:18,121
Have a seat.
You're among friends here.

237
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:20,723
Whatever you want to know
we'll tell you.

238
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,361
You don't know when the bus leaves
for Sorrento? We'll tell you.

239
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:26,240
Do you want to know what day
it is today? We'll tell you.

240
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:29,359
Do you want to know if this is
a leap year? We'll tell you.

241
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:33,520
No, I only want to know
about the bus for Sorrento.

242
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,479
- Why are you going there?
- I've been offered a job..

243
00:13:37,007 --> 00:13:39,316
- A good job?
- A very good job,

244
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,323
otherwise I wouldn't have left
Turkey.

245
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:43,517
This is my letter of
introduction.

246
00:13:43,567 --> 00:13:45,876
- Do you have relatives there?
- No.

247
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:48,885
- Friends? Acquaintances?
- No, no.

248
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,883
- Mothers? Fathers?
- Of course not!

249
00:13:50,927 --> 00:13:53,395
- Why did you say "mothers"?
- One never knows? They're Turks.

250
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:57,645
I'm all alone in the world.
I'm a poor Turk alone in the world.

251
00:13:57,687 --> 00:14:00,963
Really? My Turkish friend,
look over there.

252
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:05,677
- What have you done?
- I'm going back to work.

253
00:14:05,727 --> 00:14:07,877
You're untiring.

254
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:10,487
You've just come out of prison
and you're going back to work?

255
00:14:10,527 --> 00:14:12,518
- Yes.
- Take a vacation.

256
00:14:12,567 --> 00:14:14,922
Life is for the living!

257
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:16,719
I can't afford it.

258
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:18,485
- What'll we do now?
- I'll get rid of him.

259
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:20,006
- Will you kill him?
- No, no.

260
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:22,845
- Go on! Kill him.
- No.

261
00:14:22,887 --> 00:14:24,923
- Be kind and kill him.
- No way!

262
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:27,242
I'm asking you for a favor.
I'm asking as a friend.

263
00:14:27,287 --> 00:14:28,845
- No, I can't.
- Shall I kill him?

264
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:31,276
- No, I'll get him out of sight.
- How will you do that?

265
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:33,283
I've a small room over there.
I'll hide him in there.

266
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:38,485
- Who is it?
- The police.

267
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:40,677
You can't take one step - -

268
00:14:40,727 --> 00:14:43,525
- I'm innocent!
- Shut up! Just a moment.

269
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:45,962
- Open up!
- I'm innocent!

270
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:48,840
- Give me a hand.
- No, no, I'm not getting involved.

271
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,957
- I have to hide him.
- I'm not getting involved.

272
00:14:51,007 --> 00:14:52,486
I can't do it alone!

273
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:54,882
- I heard you. I'm coming!
- It's concealment of a corpse.

274
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,963
- What?
- Concealment.

275
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:59,237
There! I'm coming.

276
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:01,847
Gentlemen!

277
00:15:02,487 --> 00:15:05,206
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- No problem.

278
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:06,885
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

279
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:08,485
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

280
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:10,643
Have you by any chance seen
two escapees?

281
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:13,360
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

282
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,762
- About what?
- Two escapees...

283
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:17,639
-2 escapees from the madhouse?
- What?

284
00:15:17,687 --> 00:15:20,155
- No, from the prison.
- The answer's no.

285
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:22,243
No, we haven't seen them.
Have you seen them?

286
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:24,482
- No, we neither-
- Thank goodness..

287
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:28,725
If you should see them,
please inform us immediately.

288
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,918
- Naturally.
- Even if they're hostile?

289
00:15:32,087 --> 00:15:34,237
That doesn't matter. We want them.

290
00:15:34,287 --> 00:15:36,517
- You can count on us.
- Thanks.

291
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,478
- Are you armed?
- Yes, but not...

292
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:40,722
Good for you.

293
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:44,760
With all the criminals around
you do well to carry a gun.

294
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:46,957
- We ourselves advise it..
- Really?

295
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:50,886
Never go out without a gun.
If you see them, let us know.

296
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:52,599
- Of course.
- Good evening.

297
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:54,717
- Good evening.
- Goodbye.

298
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:57,477
What fine people!

299
00:15:57,767 --> 00:16:00,998
- Where will we go now?
- Do you know what I say?

300
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:06,485
Let's go home. If those two find
them they'll bring them to us.

301
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:08,597
- You're right.
- Count on it!

302
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:11,478
What a scare!

303
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:13,722
I think we did very well.

304
00:16:18,287 --> 00:16:20,278
A fat wallet!

305
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:22,841
Goodness! What a lot of money!

306
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:26,766
I don't want any of that money.
It'd burn my hands.

307
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:29,605
Who said I'd give you any?
You can have his papers and I.D.

308
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:32,639
Sure! Because I eat papers
and I.D. cards?

309
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:35,759
You don't get it Put his papers
in your pocket...

310
00:16:35,807 --> 00:16:39,720
...and wear his clothes. This is
his letter of introduction...

311
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:42,520
...and tomorrow morning you can
go to the job meant for him

312
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:45,479
- What if it's a nasty job?
- I'm not abandoning you.

313
00:16:45,527 --> 00:16:48,041
To keep an eye on you from
a distance I'm coming too.

314
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:50,078
If you need anything, send me
a signal and I'll come over.

315
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:52,687
A signal? For example?
A whistle?

316
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:54,843
- No, not a whistle.
- It's common.

317
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:58,243
- Yes, too common.
- I know!

318
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:01,599
- A raspberry.
- No, that's too vulgar!

319
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,524
We need something that's
easy to hear.

320
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:05,997
A canon shot!

321
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,437
I know!

322
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:11,045
- A dog-like bark?
- A dog's voice.

323
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:12,645
- Let's have "His Master's Voice".
- What are you getting at?

324
00:17:12,687 --> 00:17:15,804
- It'd be clearer.
- Felice, stop joking.

325
00:17:15,847 --> 00:17:17,519
Tomorrow morning,
we'll leave for Sorrento!

326
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,683
- Sorrento?
- Yes, Sorrento!

327
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:22,321
"Up with Sorrento,
the town of beautiful women".

328
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:24,403
"We are standing in line-... "

329
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:44,326
Excuse me.

330
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:47,240
- May I ask you for an information?
- Information? What about?

331
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:50,484
Actually, it's not for me but
for this gentleman who's Turkish.

332
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:53,479
- He's new in town and...

333
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:05,800
- What was that, Arabic?
- I'm a Turkish speaker.

334
00:18:05,847 --> 00:18:07,963
- In Sorrento?
- Yes..

335
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:10,362
- Are you the only Turkish speaker?
- Yes, I am.

336
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:13,877
Then I'd like to ask you
for some information.

337
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,487
- What
- Do you know Pasquale Catone?

338
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:18,757
Certainly!

339
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,480
Do you see that store
at the end of the street?

340
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:23,245
- The second one?
- That's where you'll find Catone.

341
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:24,686
- That's his store?
- Yes, it is.

342
00:18:24,727 --> 00:18:26,479
Thank you. Goodbye.

343
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:34,955
He was speaking Turkish,
did you get that? Let's go.

344
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:41,958
Has the mail bus from Naples
arrived?

345
00:18:42,007 --> 00:18:44,840
- Not yet.
- Michele, I mean Peppino!

346
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:46,957
- Yes, Don Pasquale.
- Don't forget,

347
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:51,319
any letter, any note,
any communication,

348
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:55,645
even not addressed to me,
must be handed only to me,

349
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:59,282
Because I must see everything
and know everything

350
00:18:59,647 --> 00:19:02,764
and you must keep me updated.
Is that clear?

351
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:08,641
Soon, he'll be censuring even
our private correspondence.

352
00:19:08,687 --> 00:19:11,485
No, he just wants to keep tabs
on his daughter.

353
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,087
Not his daughter! His wife!
He's extremely jealous!

354
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:16,402
That's what happens
when a man of his age...

355
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,836
...remarries, choosing
a bride of 26!

356
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:26,797
"Carmelo, Carmelo,"

357
00:19:26,927 --> 00:19:29,964
"You alone aren't enough for me,
I need three like you. "

358
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:32,475
"Carmelo, Carmelo... "
- Concetta!

359
00:19:32,527 --> 00:19:35,166
What are you doing?

360
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,324
I told you to keep watch
and you stand here singing?

361
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,597
- But I was keeping watch.
- Really?

362
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:43,923
Tell me, what did you see? What
did you hear? Bring me up to date.

363
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:46,117
Your wife has a visitor.

364
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:49,125
A visitor? Under my nose?

365
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:52,284
How did they get in?
Go on, speak! Who is it?

366
00:19:52,327 --> 00:19:55,922
- The dressmaker.
- You nearly gave me a heart attack!

367
00:19:57,407 --> 00:20:01,446
- Did you set out the alarm clocks?
- Yes, sir.

368
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:04,240
I put one in the
wardrobe,

369
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:07,245
another in the dressing table
and the other under the mattress!

370
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:09,756
What a great idea
you came up with!

371
00:20:12,487 --> 00:20:15,479
It's 10:48.
We'll see if my wife...

372
00:20:15,527 --> 00:20:18,803
...is able to tell us the exact
time the alarm rang

373
00:20:19,247 --> 00:20:22,523
If she can't,
I'll be entitled to suspect...

374
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:26,446
...that she was distracted,
occupied by other things.

375
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:28,921
Don Pasquale, there's a letter
from Naples!

376
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:31,401
- Go back down! I'm coming.
- Fine, fine.

377
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:35,676
A man in my house?
Never! What a life!

378
00:20:35,727 --> 00:20:38,480
Don't get angry, Don Pasquale.
It's bad for your health.

379
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,643
I wish this secretary would
arrive. He could...

380
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:44,646
...take care of my business and
I could keep an eye on Giulietta.

381
00:20:50,887 --> 00:20:53,526
What are you wearing?

382
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:56,600
- It's a bathing suit.
- Have you gone mad?

383
00:20:56,647 --> 00:20:59,525
- Do you expect to swim naked?
- Don't exaggerate, Daddy.

384
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:01,558
These are the new costumes.

385
00:21:01,607 --> 00:21:03,677
You promised to take us to
the seaside and we want to swim.

386
00:21:03,727 --> 00:21:07,083
If you don't cover up,
you're not going swimming!

387
00:21:07,207 --> 00:21:10,483
- Be reasonable.
- Reason is for fools.

388
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:13,485
Not only are you to wear
a blanket,

389
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:16,166
but also gloves,
your black shawl and...

390
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:18,921
What? No stockings?!

391
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:21,925
- Put them on immediately.
- But they're too hot!

392
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,480
You too.

393
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:25,563
Daddy, we want to bathe in
the sea, not in our own sweat!

394
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:27,962
You dare to raise your voice
to your father?

395
00:21:28,007 --> 00:21:29,998
What will you do
when you have a husband?

396
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:32,083
I haven't yet decided
if I want a husband.

397
00:21:32,127 --> 00:21:35,836
Don't start that! I've given
my word to Don Carluccio!

398
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:38,765
- Yours, but not mine!
- Mine counts for yours as well!

399
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:43,164
Anyhow, Carluccio
is young, strong and courageous.

400
00:21:43,207 --> 00:21:45,801
I don't like him! He's vulgar,
rude and without poetry.

401
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,725
You need to marry
a husband not a poet!

402
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:51,281
- But I...
- Stop, or we won't get to the sea.

403
00:21:51,327 --> 00:21:53,363
Don Pasquale, may I come in?

404
00:21:53,407 --> 00:21:55,523
What? Get out!
Go downstairs! Close your eyes!

405
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,478
How dare you come into
a bedroom?

406
00:21:57,527 --> 00:21:59,882
Excuse me, Don Pasquale, but
you told me to call you...

407
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:02,521
...on the arrival of the man
sent by the Deputy.

408
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:05,560
He's arrived? What's he like?

409
00:22:08,887 --> 00:22:11,924
- Is the boss coming or not?
- Yes, he's on his way..

410
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:16,075
- Does the boss have a wife?
- Yes but pretend she doesn't exist.

411
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:18,038
Do they have any children?

412
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:21,682
- A daughter of twenty.
- Fine! That's the best age.

413
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:24,719
Yes, but pretend she doesn't
exist either.

414
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:27,282
- Do they exist or not?
- They do, but they're always...

415
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:29,716
...kept under lock and key.
- Like prisoners? Poor things.

416
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:32,600
At last!
Welcome!

417
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:35,162
You're here at last!

418
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:38,479
My dear Pasquale! How are you?

419
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:40,962
What a great pleasure!

420
00:22:41,007 --> 00:22:44,204
- Do me know me?
- You tell me that.

421
00:22:44,247 --> 00:22:46,044
- Do you know me?
- No.

422
00:22:46,087 --> 00:22:48,920
Neither do I. What does that
matter? I've a note for you.

423
00:22:50,247 --> 00:22:52,761
And you were sent here
by the Deputy?

424
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:55,116
- Me? By the Deputy?
- Yes.

425
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,839
But of course.

426
00:22:57,927 --> 00:23:00,487
- How old are you?
- How old am I?

427
00:23:00,527 --> 00:23:03,087
- Yes, you.
- "... tyseven"!

428
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:06,478
-37 or 47?
- Whichever you prefer.

429
00:23:06,527 --> 00:23:09,166
I was born in that decade.

430
00:23:09,207 --> 00:23:12,005
What did you do before this?

431
00:23:12,047 --> 00:23:14,163
- Do you want the truth?
- Yes, the truth.

432
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,605
- I was a womanizer!
- A what?

433
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:20,320
- A womanizer? You?
- A womanizer.

434
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:22,722
The Deputy has lost his mind!

435
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:26,601
"Allow me to introduce...
Letter following. " The letter!

436
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:29,358
Here's the letter..

437
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:33,245
- You said...
- Hurry up!

438
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:37,839
"My illustrious friend as promised
I'm sending you a secretary.

439
00:23:38,087 --> 00:23:42,717
He's an excellent young man,
honest, loyal and hard working,

440
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:46,801
but the poor fellow
is the victim of misfortune..

441
00:23:47,087 --> 00:23:49,362
At the age of 15... "

442
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:53,681
"he was taken to a harem
where he turned into a eunuch.

443
00:23:53,727 --> 00:23:55,877
He's the perfect man for the job. "

444
00:24:12,207 --> 00:24:14,880
"Be kind and never remind him
of his handicap.

445
00:24:14,927 --> 00:24:17,487
Very sincerely yours,
Federico Cocchelletti. "

446
00:24:26,887 --> 00:24:30,163
We won't mention it again.

447
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:33,802
- No, no, let's talk about it.
- I understand your previous job...

448
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,486
Womanizer. Naturally, you were
always surrounded by women.

449
00:24:36,527 --> 00:24:39,325
- I became a womanizer only later.
- Oh, really?

450
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:43,360
I realized my physique is perfect
for being around women.

451
00:24:43,407 --> 00:24:46,080
- Sorry!.
- No problem.

452
00:24:46,127 --> 00:24:48,322
Anyhow, there are so many other
forms of satisfaction in life.

453
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:51,564
- Yes, but...
- They're more trouble than joy!

454
00:24:51,607 --> 00:24:54,360
I know. I'm always at
loggerheads with my wife.

455
00:24:54,407 --> 00:24:56,841
Now your worries are over,
Pasquale.

456
00:24:56,887 --> 00:24:59,196
I'm here now and
I'll give you a hand.

457
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,637
Thanks, thanks,
but you must think of your health.

458
00:25:02,687 --> 00:25:05,485
- I'm fine.
- Build yourself up! Have you eaten?

459
00:25:05,527 --> 00:25:07,722
Me? Actually, I haven't.

460
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:10,884
I'll get you something straight
away. Concetta! Concetta!

461
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:14,840
I know how embarrassing
your situation is.

462
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:18,516
Excuse me, I don't want to sound
nosey but why is it embarrassing?

463
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:20,637
It's best not to talk about.

464
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:23,679
- No, no, let's talk about it!
- That's not such a good idea.

465
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:26,676
Did you call, sir?
- Yes, I did.

466
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:28,922
- Is this your maid?
- Yes, her name's Concetta.

467
00:25:28,967 --> 00:25:32,516
- Cute! What's her mistress like?!

468
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:36,958
Take this young man upstairs
and serve him breakfast.

469
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:39,157
This young man? Upstairs?

470
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:40,959
- Take this young man upstairs.
- Yes, upstairs.

471
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:44,044
This young man is to be treated
like one of the family.

472
00:25:44,087 --> 00:25:47,045
- And don't vex him.
- I mustn't be vexed.

473
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:51,603
Right! This young man can
ask for whatever he likes.

474
00:25:52,127 --> 00:25:55,597
Got that? He said I can
ask for whatever I like.

475
00:25:55,647 --> 00:25:57,478
- Anything!
- Anything I like.

476
00:25:57,527 --> 00:25:59,483
- Even if I wanted...
- Chicken? Chicken.

477
00:25:59,527 --> 00:26:01,882
Lobster? Lobster.
Absolutely anything.

478
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:04,043
If that's what you want.
You're the boss!

479
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:06,999
- Go and enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

480
00:26:07,047 --> 00:26:11,120
So everything's agreed, right?
You'll receive 100 liras a month.

481
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:13,886
Board and lodging and your
laundry will be washed and ironed.

482
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:17,476
- I didn't quite get that.
-100 liras a month.

483
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:19,962
Board and lodging and your
laundry will be washed and ironed.

484
00:26:20,007 --> 00:26:22,237
- I see..
- We're agreed, right?

485
00:26:22,287 --> 00:26:24,676
Your fun will all be paid for.

486
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:26,479
- Do you accept?
- I do.

487
00:26:26,527 --> 00:26:28,836
100 liras a month, board and
lodging, laundry washed...

488
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,481
...and ironed, all found.
- Correct.

489
00:26:31,527 --> 00:26:33,563
- Enjoy your meal.
- Don Pasquale, we've agreed, right?

490
00:26:33,607 --> 00:26:36,041
100 liras a month, board and
lodging, laundry washed...

491
00:26:36,087 --> 00:26:38,476
...and ironed.
- Precisely. Goodbye.

492
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,717
Poor fellow!

493
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:45,043
I feel sorry for him! What kind
of man is a man who isn't a man?

494
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:47,123
- I sympathize with him!
- What's up, Don Pasquale?

495
00:26:47,167 --> 00:26:49,123
- Nothing. You can't understand.
- Good day!

496
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:51,965
- My dear Ignazio!
- How's it going, Pasquale?

497
00:26:52,007 --> 00:26:54,965
How do you think it's going?
You're aware of my problems.

498
00:26:55,007 --> 00:26:57,077
You know, my store,
my wife...

499
00:26:57,127 --> 00:27:00,597
I know. My worries
are the same as yours.

500
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:03,759
We were wrong to marry
two young girls.!

501
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:07,083
That's true, but I was longing
to have a child..

502
00:27:07,607 --> 00:27:10,599
That's why I married but
the baby never came...

503
00:27:10,647 --> 00:27:13,366
...and my problems stayed the same.
- So everything will go...

504
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:15,079
...to Don Carluccio, your nephew.
- Yes, I know.

505
00:27:15,127 --> 00:27:17,163
- By the way, where is he?
- Hasn't he turned up yet?

506
00:27:17,207 --> 00:27:18,879
- Pasquale: No.
- He should have arrived before me.

507
00:27:19,327 --> 00:27:21,887
Could he have gotten himself
into more trouble?

508
00:27:21,927 --> 00:27:24,361
You know how irascible he is.

509
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:27,160
He can never keep
his mouth shut.

510
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:29,198
- Yesterday evening...
- What did he do?

511
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,477
He grabbed a man and
threw him in the air.

512
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:33,040
- No.
- I swear!

513
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:35,840
- Carluccio: Good day to you all!
- Don Carluccio! Do come in!

514
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,639
- This is your second home!
- How formal, Don Pasquale!

515
00:27:37,687 --> 00:27:39,996
Tomorrow evening, I'm getting
engaged to your daughter,

516
00:27:40,047 --> 00:27:43,164
soon, I'll be marrying her and
you still call me Don Carluccio?

517
00:27:43,687 --> 00:27:45,678
Is it your way of
making fun of me.

518
00:27:45,727 --> 00:27:48,195
- Absolutely not!
- Quiet! Don't provoke him.

519
00:27:48,247 --> 00:27:51,125
From today on, I want you
to address me familiarly, OK?

520
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:53,601
Yes, Don Carluccio.
As you wish!

521
00:27:53,647 --> 00:27:56,525
He used the familiar form with you,
see? Don't get angry.

522
00:27:57,887 --> 00:27:59,957
Stand up and greet me!

523
00:28:00,007 --> 00:28:01,998
Good day, good day...!

524
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,605
- I'll teach you a lesson.
- I'm so sorry.

525
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:06,115
Calm down, dear nephew.

526
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:08,362
He's still upset about
what happened yesterday evening.

527
00:28:08,407 --> 00:28:10,796
Carluccio, tell Pasquale
what happened.

528
00:28:10,847 --> 00:28:14,806
- Nothing important.
- That's what he says!

529
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:17,481
- He threw 4 people into the air.
- No!

530
00:28:17,527 --> 00:28:19,961
Yes. Bam! Bam!

531
00:28:20,007 --> 00:28:22,202
4 people? 10 people.

532
00:28:22,247 --> 00:28:23,885
- Ten?
- Yes, ten.

533
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:26,919
They hadn't taken their hats off
when I walked by.

534
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:28,844
How uncouth!

535
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:31,242
He's worth his weight in gold.

536
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:33,801
- Let's hope he doesn't slim down!
- Marrying him, your daughter...

537
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:35,917
...will strike it rich.
- I know. I know.

538
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:38,356
Regards this marriage,
I'd like to say something.

539
00:28:38,407 --> 00:28:40,363
- By all means.
- I fear that your daughter...

540
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:43,126
...doesn't like me much.
- That's not true.

541
00:28:43,287 --> 00:28:45,642
Tomorrow evening, if your daughter

542
00:28:45,687 --> 00:28:48,201
...were to repeat that
she doesn't want to marry me,

543
00:28:48,407 --> 00:28:52,161
there'll be all hell to pay for,
Don Pasquale!

544
00:28:52,207 --> 00:28:55,085
Heavens no! My daughter
can't wait to become your wife.

545
00:28:55,127 --> 00:28:57,880
- Isn't that so?
- Of course it is!

546
00:28:58,527 --> 00:29:01,997
Here you are! These are boiled
eggs and these are sweet cookies!

547
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:03,844
- Do you like salami?
- Yes, very much.

548
00:29:03,887 --> 00:29:06,321
Then I'll bring some bread
and make you a sandwich.

549
00:29:07,487 --> 00:29:11,116
Now, I'll make you a sandwich.
Shall I slice it from here?

550
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,805
- No.
- Do you prefer it from here?

551
00:29:12,847 --> 00:29:15,964
No, look. Take this loaf
and cut it like that.

552
00:29:16,127 --> 00:29:18,960
Fill it with the salami,
eggs and cookies...

553
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,123
...and I'll nibble on it,
bit by bit.

554
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:31,403
- What are you doing?
- I'm having a taste. Go on slicing.

555
00:29:31,447 --> 00:29:33,483
- Slice away! Slice away!
- Do you like it like this?

556
00:29:33,527 --> 00:29:36,041
I love it like that!
Slice away! Slice away!

557
00:29:36,487 --> 00:29:39,559
You kissed me!
I shall tell my master.

558
00:29:39,607 --> 00:29:42,167
A great idea! Then Don Pasquale
will come and scold you.

559
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:45,961
Didn't you hear what he said?
"You mustn't vex...

560
00:29:46,207 --> 00:29:48,482
...this young man! You must
give him everything he wants!"

561
00:29:48,527 --> 00:29:51,678
But Don Pasquale was talking
of chicken and lobster...

562
00:29:51,727 --> 00:29:54,366
Chicken, lobster and kisses!
He forget to tell you.

563
00:29:54,407 --> 00:29:56,125
- Kisses...
- They were included.

564
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:58,317
Keep your hands to yourself!

565
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:00,358
But, my little Concetta,
I'm Turkish. You must understand...

566
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:03,763
...that I'm like an octopus. You
see two hands but I have 6 others.

567
00:30:03,807 --> 00:30:06,526
How witty you are!

568
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:10,399
So, are we agreed, Pasquale?
I'll provide the candles...

569
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:13,161
and you'll provide the ice creams,
liquors, etcetera.

570
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:15,721
Fine, but don't be stingy
as usual.

571
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:17,758
- Me?
- Yes, I know you well.

572
00:30:17,807 --> 00:30:20,765
Tomorrow evening, the Hon.
Cocchelleti will be here too so...

573
00:30:20,807 --> 00:30:22,525
- The Deputy?
- Yes, him.

574
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:25,365
- What an honor!
- Don't show me up.

575
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,398
- Of course I won't
- I'm indebted to him because

576
00:30:27,447 --> 00:30:30,837
he's having me decorated with
a title. I set great store by it.

577
00:30:30,887 --> 00:30:33,560
- Congratulations!
- Uncle, are you discussing titles?

578
00:30:33,607 --> 00:30:36,565
- We need to discuss the dowry!
- Naturally!

579
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:39,758
- We were just discussing it, right?
- Hadn't we already agreed on it?

580
00:30:39,807 --> 00:30:42,719
Yes, we certainly had.
10,000 Ducats.

581
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:46,282
- And free meals for two years.
- No, four years.

582
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:49,763
No, I can't feed them free
of charge for four years.

583
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:52,480
- Two years is all I can manage.
- Very well.

584
00:30:53,207 --> 00:30:56,882
Free meals for 4 years
and not a day more.

585
00:30:56,927 --> 00:30:58,758
- Do you agree?
- Perfectly.

586
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:01,082
Uncle, do you want me to go
and collect Aunt Angelica?

587
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:03,083
- That's an excellent idea.
- Give me the keys.

588
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:06,164
You're a good man.
She hasn't been out for 3 months.

589
00:31:06,847 --> 00:31:08,803
- Goodbye for now, Pasquale.
- Goodbye.

590
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:10,485
- So, we're agreed?
- Certainly.

591
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:13,280
Take your aunt for a nice walk.
I'll catch up with you.

592
00:31:13,887 --> 00:31:15,639
So, everything's agreed.

593
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:17,803
Do you trust your wife
with your nephew?

594
00:31:17,847 --> 00:31:21,726
The poor girl must get out
for a breath of fresh air.

595
00:31:22,287 --> 00:31:24,562
Don't worry...

596
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:28,918
- Jealousy is a terrible thing!
- You can say that again.

597
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:31,197
- It's worse than an illness.
- You're right.

598
00:31:31,247 --> 00:31:33,477
Since I got married,
I've lost 20 Ibs.

599
00:31:33,527 --> 00:31:35,483
- I've lost 30 Ibs.
- Master?

600
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:37,483
- What's the matter?
- Master?!

601
00:31:37,527 --> 00:31:39,483
- What's happened?
- Something very serious.

602
00:31:39,527 --> 00:31:41,085
Speak! What is it?

603
00:31:41,127 --> 00:31:43,721
The young man you sent
upstairs, the Turk,

604
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:45,883
is talking with your wife
and daughter.

605
00:31:45,927 --> 00:31:47,963
- So what?
- They're in the bedroom!

606
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,202
- Why did he go into the bedroom?

607
00:31:50,247 --> 00:31:54,399
I was cooking and he started
wandering around the house.

608
00:31:54,447 --> 00:31:56,881
Why are you worried about that?
It doesn't matter!

609
00:31:56,927 --> 00:31:59,487
That young man can do
whatever he likes.

610
00:31:59,527 --> 00:32:01,677
- What?!
- Take it from me.

611
00:32:01,727 --> 00:32:04,639
- If you say so...
- Yes, I do say so!

612
00:32:04,687 --> 00:32:07,326
Have you gone mad?

613
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:09,562
- Why?
- You let him talk to your wife?

614
00:32:09,607 --> 00:32:11,962
It was the Deputy who sent him
to me. He'll take care of...

615
00:32:12,007 --> 00:32:15,317
...my business so I can spend
more time with Giulietta.

616
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:18,484
In the meantime you leave your wife
in the bedroom with another man?

617
00:32:18,527 --> 00:32:21,087
- But he's not actually a man.
- What do you mean?

618
00:32:21,127 --> 00:32:22,719
Read this.

619
00:32:26,847 --> 00:32:28,997
- A eunuch?!
- I'll show him to you.

620
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,720
Pasquale, wait.
This is a miracle from heaven!

621
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:33,678
- Why?
- Pasquale,

622
00:32:33,727 --> 00:32:35,638
- do me a big favor!
- What?

623
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:37,678
Loan me this young man
for a few days!

624
00:32:37,727 --> 00:32:40,195
- What for?
- I'll keep him close to my wife...

625
00:32:40,247 --> 00:32:44,035
...and then return him to you.
Do you get it? Close to my wife.

626
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,045
- It's true. You're right!
- He'll be a great consolation.

627
00:32:47,087 --> 00:32:49,681
- So, will you loan him to me?
- Are you crazy?

628
00:32:49,727 --> 00:32:51,718
You've just given me
a brilliant idea!

629
00:32:51,767 --> 00:32:54,839
- What do you mean?
- I'll have him watch over my wife!

630
00:32:54,887 --> 00:32:57,276
No, Pasquale! Are you joking?
It was my idea!

631
00:32:57,327 --> 00:33:00,683
- Thanks! You're a real friend.
- No, Pasquale! No!

632
00:33:01,327 --> 00:33:04,160
Being a Turk is a great job.
I'll never want to leave here.

633
00:33:04,207 --> 00:33:06,641
They'll have to kill me off!

634
00:33:06,927 --> 00:33:09,839
There's no salt.
Concettina, bring the salt!

635
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,798
- What did you ask for?
- The salt.

636
00:33:11,847 --> 00:33:14,725
Do you remember what Don Pasquale
said? You mustn't contradict me.

637
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:16,838
- Where's the salt?
- Here it is.

638
00:33:21,327 --> 00:33:23,557
See how cute he is, Ignazio?

639
00:33:23,607 --> 00:33:25,484
You could have done me
that favor.

640
00:33:25,527 --> 00:33:27,757
How are you getting on?
Enjoy your meal!

641
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:30,237
- Thank you.
- Don't stand up on my account.

642
00:33:30,287 --> 00:33:32,676
- You need to rest.
- Thank you, Don Pasquale.

643
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:36,356
You're so kind, attentive,
and understanding.

644
00:33:36,407 --> 00:33:38,557
This is all fresh food
of the highest quality

645
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:41,997
- How did she serve you?
- Not badly, poor thing.

646
00:33:42,047 --> 00:33:44,607
She did her best, but it's clear
she has no experience.

647
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,763
She'll do better the next time.

648
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:49,162
Concetta, go and call my wife and
daughter. Tell them to come here.

649
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:51,278
I shall now introduce you to
my women.

650
00:33:51,327 --> 00:33:54,478
- Your women? How many are there?
- My wife and my daughter.

651
00:33:54,527 --> 00:33:57,121
Oh, I saw then earlier.
There are just two of them.

652
00:33:57,167 --> 00:34:00,876
Of course! What are only two women
to him?

653
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:03,805
He's used to being around 40 or 50.

654
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:05,997
- Even 60.
- Right, even 60.

655
00:34:06,047 --> 00:34:10,518
As there are only 2, you'll be
able to concentrate on them more.

656
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:13,320
- I'll certainly do my best.
- Thank you.

657
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:15,801
In order to show you
how grateful I am, I'll pay you

658
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:18,202
120 liras a month, all right?

659
00:34:18,247 --> 00:34:21,762
120 liras? Board, lodging and
laundry washed and ironed?

660
00:34:21,807 --> 00:34:23,479
Yes. Do you agree?
- I do.

661
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:25,643
Listen, young man,
I'm a friend of Pasquale's.

662
00:34:25,687 --> 00:34:27,837
- Pleased to meet you.
- If you come and work for me,

663
00:34:27,887 --> 00:34:29,684
I'll pay you 150 liras a month.

664
00:34:29,727 --> 00:34:31,718
This isn't gentlemanly behavior!

665
00:34:31,767 --> 00:34:35,157
Why do you say that?
He's very honest.

666
00:34:35,287 --> 00:34:38,120
- Are you married?
- Yes, if not why would I hire you?

667
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:41,079
- Why would you hire me?
- He'll never leave my employ!

668
00:34:41,127 --> 00:34:43,516
Be reasonable, Pasquale.

669
00:34:43,567 --> 00:34:48,243
30 liras more a month! Business
is business. I'm going with him.

670
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:51,199
- I'll give you 170 a month!
-170 lire a month?

671
00:34:51,247 --> 00:34:53,886
There's nothing more to be said.
He'll give me 170 a month.

672
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:55,883
Is that so?
Then I'll give you 200.

673
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,487
200! I'm going with Ignazio!

674
00:34:58,527 --> 00:35:01,200
-250!
-250? On your honor?

675
00:35:01,247 --> 00:35:03,363
- Yes.!
- I'm sorry. I can't.

676
00:35:03,407 --> 00:35:06,205
- Why? I'll give you 300.
-300?

677
00:35:06,247 --> 00:35:08,807
- He'll give me 300, Pasquale.
-300...?

678
00:35:08,847 --> 00:35:11,236
-400!
- He'll give me 400.

679
00:35:11,287 --> 00:35:14,484
-450.
-450? Come on, Pasquale.

680
00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:17,837
500! 500 going... going...

681
00:35:17,887 --> 00:35:20,845
Just a moment!...

682
00:35:20,887 --> 00:35:24,118
The one who should decide is me,
isn't it? I'm the interested party.

683
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:26,476
- Sorry!
-500. How much will you go up to?

684
00:35:26,527 --> 00:35:28,483
700 liras a month.

685
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:30,916
700?
800! Who said 800?

686
00:35:30,967 --> 00:35:32,525
- Not me.
- I heard 800.

687
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:35,081
- I heard it too.
- I know I heard it!

688
00:35:35,127 --> 00:35:37,357
We both heard it.
The majority wins.

689
00:35:37,407 --> 00:35:40,717
Right, the majority wins.
Very well.

690
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:43,601
-800 liras a month.
- Very well.

691
00:35:43,647 --> 00:35:46,036
-900-1000!
-900-1000?

692
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:49,962
900-1000? Board, lodging,
laundry washed and ironed?

693
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:54,479
Going, going, gone!
You win! I'm yours.

694
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,483
- He's mine.
- I'm his..

695
00:35:57,207 --> 00:36:00,483
I could have offered you more
but you're so keen on him.

696
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:03,087
I trust you'll loan him to me
from time to time.

697
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:07,999
We'll see, but he'll certainly be
busy working for me.

698
00:36:08,047 --> 00:36:12,404
If he's giving me 1,000 liras a
month it means I'm worth something.

699
00:36:12,447 --> 00:36:14,915
- And he knows it..
- It's not your fault..

700
00:36:14,967 --> 00:36:17,800
You lost one thing of value
and acquired another.

701
00:36:17,847 --> 00:36:20,884
Besides the usual things,
what will I have to do?

702
00:36:20,927 --> 00:36:25,398
Dear fellow, in this house
there are two pretty women...

703
00:36:25,447 --> 00:36:29,599
...you'll have to watch over and
no one can do it better than you.

704
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:32,286
I see.
Word has gotten around.

705
00:36:33,247 --> 00:36:35,283
Someone must have spoken.

706
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:37,682
Rest assured we'll know
how to keep your secret.

707
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:40,366
- Naturally.
- Lisetta! Giulietta!

708
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,716
What on earth can
they be doing?

709
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,837
If you're not happy here,
come to me.

710
00:36:44,887 --> 00:36:47,196
I can promise you
700 liras a month.

711
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:49,524
Ignazio!

712
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:51,478
Here I am, Pasquale.

713
00:36:51,527 --> 00:36:53,483
- Well...
- See you tomorrow.

714
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:56,724
- See you tomorrow evening.
- Certainly. Goodbye, my friend.

715
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:59,203
- Goodbye.
- Good day.

716
00:36:59,647 --> 00:37:02,115
See you tomorrow evening. Come!

717
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:05,955
Wait for me in the drawing room.
I'll be right back.

718
00:37:09,407 --> 00:37:12,717
- What are you doing?
- We're ready. I must put on my hat.

719
00:37:12,767 --> 00:37:15,486
Hurry up! I must introduce
a young man to you.

720
00:37:16,327 --> 00:37:21,481
- You're introducing us to a man?!
- A man... Hurry up!

721
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:25,120
- A man?!
- And what a man!

722
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:28,000
He's so strong!
When he gives you a hug...

723
00:37:28,047 --> 00:37:30,197
Who is he? The one who came in here
earlier? The one with the fez

724
00:37:42,847 --> 00:37:44,758
- So, everything's agreed?
- Certainly.

725
00:37:44,807 --> 00:37:48,083
- You'll watch over them.
- I'll be at the ladies' service.

726
00:37:48,127 --> 00:37:50,038
- Exclusively.
- At their service.

727
00:37:50,087 --> 00:37:52,282
Every time they need me,
I must be ready.

728
00:37:52,327 --> 00:37:53,885
- Right!
- Fine! And for this you'll pay me

729
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:56,680
...1000 liras a month board,
lodging, laundry washed...

730
00:37:56,727 --> 00:38:00,242
...and ironed, right?
- It's a job requiring conscience.

731
00:38:00,287 --> 00:38:02,198
And I'll do it conscientiously.

732
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:05,796
Hear that? I won't need this
any more. Do you know why?

733
00:38:05,847 --> 00:38:07,565
- Because you're here.
- Really?

734
00:38:07,607 --> 00:38:09,837
He's taken me for
an alarm clock! Listen,

735
00:38:10,047 --> 00:38:12,561
I don't like standing
Idle.

736
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:15,679
- Why?
- I'm an active man.

737
00:38:15,727 --> 00:38:17,718
- I need something to do.
- For example?

738
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:21,043
At the times when the ladies
don't need me,

739
00:38:21,087 --> 00:38:23,476
since I believe they won't need
me all the time,

740
00:38:23,527 --> 00:38:26,121
- I could be useful to you.
- Doing what?

741
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:28,476
Maybe doing your accounts
or working at the cash register.

742
00:38:28,527 --> 00:38:30,358
- No.
- Yes, at the cash register!

743
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:32,523
But I already have Peppino.
He's the cashier.

744
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:34,478
Yes, but sometimes cashiers...

745
00:38:34,527 --> 00:38:36,483
- You never know.
- No, he's reliable.

746
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:38,643
- I can't stand about doing nothing.
- What would you like to do?

747
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:40,678
I could give a hand
with the housework.

748
00:38:41,047 --> 00:38:44,676
- A little sweep of the store.
- But Concettina does that!

749
00:38:44,727 --> 00:38:47,287
- Then there'll be two of us.
- May we come in?

750
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:51,240
Certainly! Giulietta,
take the gentleman's arm.

751
00:38:51,407 --> 00:38:54,160
And you take his other one.
Closer! Like that.

752
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,357
- Bur Daddy...
- Don't worry.

753
00:38:56,407 --> 00:38:58,523
He knows what he has to do.

754
00:38:58,567 --> 00:39:00,797
Yes, I know what I have to do.!

755
00:39:00,847 --> 00:39:02,565
- Off with you, now.
- Where

756
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:05,246
- To the beach.
- To the beach?! All 3 of us?!

757
00:39:05,287 --> 00:39:07,243
- Yes.
- To the beach! To have fun!

758
00:39:07,287 --> 00:39:09,881
- Yes, enjoy yourselves.
- If it's all right by him...

759
00:39:09,927 --> 00:39:12,487
- Off with you!
- We're going now!

760
00:39:26,807 --> 00:39:30,083
- Have fun!
- We certainly will.

761
00:39:30,127 --> 00:39:34,040
Whatever happens,
don't lose sight of them!

762
00:39:34,087 --> 00:39:37,079
Don't worry. I'll even stay in
the cabana while they undress..

763
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:39,163
They'll have to undress
in front of me!

764
00:39:39,207 --> 00:39:40,925
- What a dear fellow!
- Are you pleased about that?

765
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:43,322
- I certainly am!
- If it's all right with you...

766
00:39:43,367 --> 00:39:45,403
- Go and have fun!
- Thank you.

767
00:39:45,447 --> 00:39:48,359
- Goodbye! How sweet they look!
- Don Pasqale is happy!

768
00:39:48,407 --> 00:39:51,080
What are you looking at, guys?
Get back to work.

769
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:54,483
Why are you just standing there?
It's incredible!

770
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:57,561
Come on, Aunt Angelica!
I'm taking you for a breath of air.

771
00:39:57,847 --> 00:39:59,758
We're going to have
a wonderful stroll!

772
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:02,196
- Carluccio!
- Uncle Ignazio!

773
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:07,880
As promised, I'm taking your better
half for a stroll.

774
00:40:08,487 --> 00:40:11,206
Thanks, but there's no need.
I'll take her.

775
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:13,203
- What about me?
- You're free.

776
00:40:13,487 --> 00:40:15,955
As you wish.
At your service, Aunt Angelica

777
00:40:16,007 --> 00:40:17,998
- Goodbye, Carluccio.
- Take care, Uncle.!

778
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,522
- The keys!
- Right! The keys.

779
00:40:20,887 --> 00:40:23,162
- See you!
- Bye bye.

780
00:40:24,167 --> 00:40:27,398
Can't I even have a walk
with Carluccio?

781
00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:29,677
- You'll have it with me.
- Where will you take me?

782
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,524
- To the beach.
- The beach?

783
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:33,558
- Yes, the seaside!
- Let's go!.

784
00:41:14,047 --> 00:41:17,483
SIRENA BEACH
WOMEN - MEN

785
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:19,482
Come on, Felice.

786
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:22,365
Come in. Sit here.

787
00:43:22,407 --> 00:43:24,682
- They're all dying to met you.
- Really?

788
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:28,322
I too am happy...

789
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:31,279
...to be among
these bathing beauties!

790
00:43:33,687 --> 00:43:36,076
Felice, tell us about
the Orient!

791
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:40,962
The Orient! Allah!
Allah! Mohammed!

792
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:44,716
If you've been there,
you must know the Ottomans.

793
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,486
I know the ottomans,
the sofas, the armchairs...

794
00:43:53,527 --> 00:43:55,324
I met a footstool...

795
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:56,561
You mean an Ottoman!

796
00:43:56,607 --> 00:43:59,246
It was an ottoman, but
it lost some of its stuffing...

797
00:43:59,287 --> 00:44:02,245
...so it was turned into a footstool!

798
00:44:05,647 --> 00:44:09,799
A footstool that had
such long legs...

799
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:13,157
...that it was only good for a giant!

800
00:44:35,607 --> 00:44:40,078
Is it true that in the Orient
the women are all hot-blooded?

801
00:44:40,127 --> 00:44:42,641
I wouldn't go so far as to say it.
They're not really hot-blooded.

802
00:44:42,687 --> 00:44:44,484
- No?
- But not cold-blooded, either.

803
00:44:44,527 --> 00:44:46,483
- What are they like, then?
- They're at room temperature.

804
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:51,197
Is it true they're extraordinarily
fascinating?

805
00:44:51,487 --> 00:44:54,399
Yes, it's true.
I met a woman who,

806
00:44:54,447 --> 00:44:58,725
as soon as she looked at a man,
made him drop to the floor.

807
00:44:58,767 --> 00:45:00,917
- Was she so beautiful?
- No, she just brought bad luck.

808
00:45:00,967 --> 00:45:05,040
She brought bad luck.

809
00:45:06,967 --> 00:45:10,482
Felice, do some men over there
really have 50 wives?

810
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:13,883
Yes! The worst part is that
they also have 49 mothers-in-law!

811
00:45:13,927 --> 00:45:15,565
Why 49?

812
00:45:15,607 --> 00:45:17,643
Among 50 wives
there's always one orphan.!

813
00:45:20,287 --> 00:45:23,597
- Where's Lisetta?
- She stepped out a moment.

814
00:45:23,647 --> 00:45:27,083
A good thing! Now we're all ladies.
She's just a girl.

815
00:45:28,247 --> 00:45:30,397
Is it true the engagement
will be announced tomorrow?

816
00:45:30,447 --> 00:45:33,359
Yes, but I don't want to be there.
I swear I'll never marry that man.

817
00:45:33,727 --> 00:45:36,878
Thank you. Here, this poem is
for you.

818
00:45:36,927 --> 00:45:39,361
Thank you. 'Bye!

819
00:45:42,087 --> 00:45:46,365
- Let's go.
- No! Tell us some more! Sit down!

820
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:49,797
Tell us, Felice, in the harems
do they have fun?

821
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:51,724
- Do they sing and dance?
- Certainly.

822
00:45:51,767 --> 00:45:54,486
They have fun singing,
dancing and... etc.

823
00:45:54,527 --> 00:45:58,918
- What dances do they do?
- Oriental ones.

824
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:01,162
- Can you do them?
- Naturally!

825
00:46:01,207 --> 00:46:03,482
I don't like to boast,
but it could be said...

826
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:07,076
...that the inventor of the famous
belly dance...

827
00:46:07,127 --> 00:46:10,961
...is your truly!

828
00:46:12,287 --> 00:46:16,166
- How did that happen?
- It came about by chance.

829
00:46:16,567 --> 00:46:21,243
In a harem I'd prepared for myself
a salad of Turkish chilies...

830
00:46:21,287 --> 00:46:23,801
...and Dutch fennel.

831
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:26,600
I couldn't digest
the Dutch fennel,

832
00:46:26,647 --> 00:46:28,763
and my stomach hurt
almost as if I were in labor.

833
00:46:28,807 --> 00:46:31,605
I started moaning and
writhing, like this...

834
00:46:52,607 --> 00:46:55,405
- That's enough! Off you go!
- You're fantastic!

835
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:58,126
You haven't told us whether
you like our costumes.

836
00:46:58,167 --> 00:47:01,125
This is no costume!
It's a deep sea diving suit!

837
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:05,843
- It's a Parisian model!
- What? It's nothing of the sort!

838
00:47:06,007 --> 00:47:09,636
Let me give you a hand.
I came from Turkey via Paris.

839
00:47:09,687 --> 00:47:12,485
To turn this into a Parisian
model, you have to do like this.

840
00:47:12,527 --> 00:47:16,281
- Remove these sleeves!
- Why? Felice!

841
00:47:16,327 --> 00:47:20,206
- And these pants? Off with them!
- No, Felice!

842
00:47:20,247 --> 00:47:23,603
Let your skin breathe!
Tear this off!

843
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:26,639
Lift your skirt!
Stockings?!

844
00:47:27,087 --> 00:47:30,124
You look like a zebra crossways!
Off with those stockings!

845
00:47:30,167 --> 00:47:32,727
Off with your shoes!
Off with these rags!

846
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:36,316
Lisette, come here.
Let's remove these sleeves.

847
00:47:36,807 --> 00:47:39,367
What do you have here?
A note?

848
00:47:39,647 --> 00:47:41,717
- May I?
- Yes..

849
00:47:41,767 --> 00:47:45,077
"Lisa Lisetta, when I see you
my forehead starts to burn...

850
00:47:45,127 --> 00:47:47,925
...and I feel my heart
beating fast"

851
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,197
A nice poem! Magnificent!

852
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:53,564
- Do you love him a lot?
- Yes, I'm lost my head.

853
00:47:53,607 --> 00:47:56,804
Really? You've lost your head
for a man who writes such verses?

854
00:47:56,847 --> 00:48:01,125
If you'd met Leopardi,
what would you have lost?

855
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:05,080
Come on! Hurry! Take off
these rags! Let it breathe!

856
00:48:05,127 --> 00:48:09,325
Let your skin breathe! Into
the sea! The diving! The waves!

857
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:43,080
Come on, girls! Are we going
for a swim or not?

858
00:48:43,127 --> 00:48:47,120
Yes!

859
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:10,479
Come on down!

860
00:50:21,807 --> 00:50:24,480
How are you?

861
00:50:25,807 --> 00:50:27,798
- Did I hurt you?
- As usual.

862
00:50:27,847 --> 00:50:29,838
So, what's up?

863
00:50:29,887 --> 00:50:33,118
- How's it going here?
- Badly.

864
00:50:33,167 --> 00:50:34,566
What are they paying you?

865
00:50:34,607 --> 00:50:36,484
1000, washing, ironing...

866
00:50:36,527 --> 00:50:38,483
- What's the matter?
- A chill in...

867
00:50:38,527 --> 00:50:40,757
...my left arm,
that also blocks the right one..

868
00:50:40,807 --> 00:50:44,482
You're paid 1,000, that's 500 liras
each. Remember we're partners.

869
00:50:44,527 --> 00:50:46,916
What do you mean 1,000?
I think you misunderstood.

870
00:50:46,967 --> 00:50:50,482
I meant 1,000 troubles a month,
1,000 heavy jobs!

871
00:50:50,527 --> 00:50:53,087
- But what's your salary?
- What salary? Nothing!

872
00:50:53,127 --> 00:50:54,685
And you're not complaining?

873
00:50:54,727 --> 00:50:57,161
- If I complain, they reduce them.
- So, you're happy here.

874
00:50:57,487 --> 00:51:01,162
I'm miserable.
They make me work like a Turk.

875
00:51:01,207 --> 00:51:03,084
- I can't take it any more.
- What'll you do? Have you decided?

876
00:51:03,127 --> 00:51:05,641
What'll I do?
If it goes on like this...

877
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:08,326
...I'll have to do the work of 3 men,
understood? 3 men!

878
00:51:08,367 --> 00:51:10,676
Where do you work?
Do you have an office or some...?

879
00:51:10,727 --> 00:51:14,242
What office?
I work wherever I am.

880
00:51:14,407 --> 00:51:16,477
Sometimes, they make me work
in the kitchen.

881
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:18,518
- Good Lord!
- Me!

882
00:51:18,567 --> 00:51:21,479
Then leave. We'll find you
another job. I'll take care of it.

883
00:51:21,527 --> 00:51:23,483
- I can't leave..
- What do you mean?

884
00:51:23,527 --> 00:51:25,916
The work's tough, it's killing me
but I'm staying!

885
00:51:25,967 --> 00:51:28,481
- But it's not worth it!
- It's a matter of principle!

886
00:51:28,527 --> 00:51:30,802
- Felice, where are you?

887
00:51:30,847 --> 00:51:32,917
It's the master.
I'm here, Don Pasquale! Coming!

888
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:35,276
- Hurry! We're waiting for you!
- I'll be right there.!

889
00:51:35,327 --> 00:51:38,125
Did you hear that?
He's calling me to work.

890
00:51:38,167 --> 00:51:40,362
- Even at this time?
- Yes.

891
00:51:40,407 --> 00:51:43,080
Considering the job I do
this is a good time.

892
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:46,365
I'll tell you the truth.
This is a job I enjoy.

893
00:51:46,407 --> 00:51:48,921
- You do?
- Yes, you'd enjoy it too.

894
00:51:48,967 --> 00:51:52,642
- No, no, no, no.
- Come on!

895
00:51:53,087 --> 00:51:55,726
- You're so stubborn! Come on!
- No, no, no, no.

896
00:51:55,767 --> 00:51:59,077
You know I do a completely
different job.

897
00:51:59,127 --> 00:52:01,482
A dishonest one. There's no work
for you, here. Go back to Naples.

898
00:52:01,527 --> 00:52:03,483
- No, I'm staying.
- No, don't stay.

899
00:52:03,527 --> 00:52:06,041
I want to keep an eye on you.
I'm worried about you overworking.

900
00:52:06,087 --> 00:52:09,796
I want to keep an eye on you.
If you need me, remember...

901
00:52:09,847 --> 00:52:12,202
And I'll come running.

902
00:52:17,247 --> 00:52:20,762
He's a cross-breed.
His father was a Dachshund.

903
00:52:20,807 --> 00:52:22,718
Goodbye.

904
00:52:22,767 --> 00:52:25,679
- Come on, Felice!
- Here I am! I'm coming

905
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,718
I'm off, now. 'Bye!

906
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,355
May I?

907
00:52:39,407 --> 00:52:41,602
- Who is it?
- It's Concetta!

908
00:52:41,647 --> 00:52:45,799
Concetta, you chose the right time!
Come on in!

909
00:52:46,527 --> 00:52:48,757
Open the shutters and
let some light in.

910
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:54,083
Where are you?

911
00:52:54,487 --> 00:52:56,478
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

912
00:52:56,527 --> 00:52:58,802
- I've brought you breakfast!
- Good!

913
00:52:58,847 --> 00:53:02,965
- Did you sleep well?
- Marvelously!

914
00:53:03,007 --> 00:53:05,885
- I had this dream...
- What did you dream?

915
00:53:06,207 --> 00:53:09,882
I dreamt that every now and then,
I got a visit...

916
00:53:09,927 --> 00:53:12,885
...from a beautiful woman
who stroked my forehead.

917
00:53:12,927 --> 00:53:15,487
- But that wasn't a dream!
- Really?

918
00:53:15,527 --> 00:53:19,236
It's was the mistress! From time
to time she came to check on you

919
00:53:19,287 --> 00:53:21,323
Oh, really? Good!

920
00:53:21,487 --> 00:53:24,957
- But you never came.
- What would I have come for?

921
00:53:25,007 --> 00:53:28,966
You, who are a Jill-of-all-trades
ask me this question?

922
00:53:29,007 --> 00:53:31,202
But at night?! What use could I
have been to you?

923
00:53:31,247 --> 00:53:33,602
A man can always need
something. If he's unwell...

924
00:53:33,647 --> 00:53:35,683
May I, Felice?

925
00:53:36,607 --> 00:53:38,996
- Good morning, Giulietta!
- Good morning.

926
00:53:39,047 --> 00:53:42,164
I've brought you some cookies
I made myself.

927
00:53:42,207 --> 00:53:45,279
- How kind you are!
- May I come in, Felice?

928
00:53:45,327 --> 00:53:47,761
- Enter, Lisetta!
- I've brought you some rum babas.

929
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:50,480
- I thought you might enjoy them.
- What a daughter!

930
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:53,883
Like mother... no,
like stepmother, like stepdaughter!

931
00:53:53,927 --> 00:53:56,043
I'll give you a cookie!

932
00:53:56,087 --> 00:53:57,884
- I'll give you a rum baba!
- What will you give me?

933
00:53:57,927 --> 00:54:00,236
- Sugar and milk.
- How kind!

934
00:54:00,287 --> 00:54:04,485
A sip, a bite
and a cookie!

935
00:54:06,047 --> 00:54:08,766
I just don't get it.

936
00:54:08,807 --> 00:54:11,480
- He was with us all day.
- But now...

937
00:54:11,887 --> 00:54:14,765
Quiet!

938
00:54:14,807 --> 00:54:17,605
What's happening, gentlemen?
Having a meeting?

939
00:54:17,647 --> 00:54:20,878
I'm going for a nice walk.

940
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:23,919
- What? Where are you going?
- You can keep an eye on the store,

941
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:26,242
he'll keep an eye on them.

942
00:54:26,287 --> 00:54:28,676
Ignazio will organize
the party for tonight,

943
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:31,480
and I'm going to go strolling
all day long.

944
00:54:31,527 --> 00:54:33,882
- Goodbye, guys!
- Goodbye.

945
00:54:42,207 --> 00:54:46,405
There! This is the last one.
Careful it doesn't burn right down!

946
00:54:47,607 --> 00:54:49,484
- Very well.
- Is that al right, Don Ignazio?

947
00:54:49,527 --> 00:54:51,483
Yes, that's fine.

948
00:54:51,527 --> 00:54:54,246
We'll put the buffet Pasquale
is bringing here,

949
00:54:54,407 --> 00:54:57,365
and we'll put the notary here.
Get a move on!

950
00:54:57,407 --> 00:54:58,681
- Ignazio!
- Oh, Angelica...

951
00:54:58,727 --> 00:55:00,479
- This isn't the time.
- What's the matter

952
00:55:00,527 --> 00:55:02,483
- Did you hang out the lamps?
- They're pretty, aren't they?

953
00:55:02,527 --> 00:55:04,916
Don't you see out thriftiness
is making us look stingy?

954
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:07,401
But I spent a ton of money
on this reception!

955
00:55:07,447 --> 00:55:10,120
What money? You haven't even
bought a bottle of sweet wine.

956
00:55:10,167 --> 00:55:12,886
- May I come in?
- Go and see who that is.

957
00:55:12,927 --> 00:55:16,602
Pasquale is to bring the sweet
wine. That was the deal.

958
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:20,686
- Who are you?
- Don Ignazio? Good evening!

959
00:55:22,767 --> 00:55:25,759
- Good evening.
- What do you want?

960
00:55:25,807 --> 00:55:28,116
- We're the orchestra.
- Don Ignazio hired us.

961
00:55:28,167 --> 00:55:30,681
- To enliven the party.
- It's true. Wait here.

962
00:55:33,847 --> 00:55:36,805
Angelica, calm down.

963
00:55:37,287 --> 00:55:40,802
- Who are they?
- The professional musicians.

964
00:55:40,847 --> 00:55:44,601
- Professional my eye!
They're all beggars.

965
00:55:44,647 --> 00:55:48,879
No, they're performers You know
performers let themselves go.

966
00:55:48,927 --> 00:55:51,566
But can't you see
they're down-and-outs?

967
00:55:51,607 --> 00:55:54,360
In these circumstances, I'm not
staying! I'm going to undress.

968
00:55:54,407 --> 00:55:58,161
Did you see how smart the waiter
in livery is?

969
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:00,516
That's hired livery, isn't it?

970
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:03,035
He's Raffaele, the swineherd.
I know him!

971
00:56:03,087 --> 00:56:06,124
- I'm going to undress!
- No! The Deputy'll be here shortly!

972
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:08,635
- I don't care.
- Pasquale's wife is coming!

973
00:56:08,687 --> 00:56:11,565
- I couldn't care less!
- The Turk is coming!

974
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:16,559
Well... in that case
if we're expecting...

975
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:19,485
...the Deputy...
- ...and Pasquale's wife...

976
00:56:19,807 --> 00:56:21,684
...I'd better stay.
- Thank you.

977
00:56:21,727 --> 00:56:24,366
Leave me alone. I'm not staying
for you but for the guests.

978
00:56:33,407 --> 00:56:36,205
Don Pasquale,
do you think I look nice?

979
00:56:36,247 --> 00:56:38,681
For 1,000 liras a month, board,
lodging, laundry washed...

980
00:56:39,287 --> 00:56:41,801
...and ironed, am I to humiliate
myself in these clothes?

981
00:56:41,847 --> 00:56:44,441
What do you mean, humiliate
yourself? You look marvellous!

982
00:56:44,487 --> 00:56:46,478
- Anyhow, the costume's yours.
- Mine?

983
00:56:46,527 --> 00:56:48,483
- It was in your case.
- Of course it's mine.

984
00:56:48,527 --> 00:56:50,483
Excuse me a moment.

985
00:56:50,527 --> 00:56:52,643
I don't want to marry him!

986
00:56:52,687 --> 00:56:55,247
- Felice?
- What's up?

987
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,676
I beg you to try
and convince her.

988
00:56:57,727 --> 00:56:59,638
I'll be grateful to you
all my life.

989
00:56:59,687 --> 00:57:01,882
I don't quite understand.
You'll be grateful to me...

990
00:57:01,927 --> 00:57:04,316
- All my life.
- You? Really?

991
00:57:04,887 --> 00:57:07,481
Madam, you're the only one
to understand...

992
00:57:07,527 --> 00:57:09,882
...that beneath these clothes
beats a virile heart.

993
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:12,487
How kind you are!

994
00:57:12,527 --> 00:57:14,483
- Did I hurt you?
- No, Felice.

995
00:57:14,527 --> 00:57:16,916
- You're so kind!

996
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:21,643
How kind you are!

997
00:57:21,687 --> 00:57:24,326
- I'll convince her.
- Thank you, Felice.

998
00:57:24,367 --> 00:57:26,642
- Chin up, Lisetta.
- I don't want to go!

999
00:57:26,687 --> 00:57:29,485
Come here! Obey!

1000
00:57:29,527 --> 00:57:31,961
I don't want to marry him!
Felice please help me!

1001
00:57:32,007 --> 00:57:36,842
Tell Carluccio you don't want
to marry him and that'll be that.

1002
00:57:36,887 --> 00:57:39,640
- A scandal!
- Well done! You got it immediately!

1003
00:57:40,167 --> 00:57:42,476
- I'll protect your retreat.
- Thanks!

1004
00:57:42,527 --> 00:57:44,483
- How kind you are!

1005
00:57:44,527 --> 00:57:46,279
- Did I hurt you?
- No.

1006
00:57:46,327 --> 00:57:48,124
- How kind you are!

1007
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:51,125
All the women in this house
are kind. What a blessing!

1008
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:54,120
- Here he is!
- Come on! Let's go!

1009
00:57:54,327 --> 00:57:57,763
- Let's go!
- After you, madam.

1010
00:57:58,727 --> 00:58:00,558
Don't scream! Go on!

1011
00:58:06,487 --> 00:58:08,478
- What's up?
- I heard everything.

1012
00:58:08,527 --> 00:58:10,518
- What did you hear?
-1,000 liras, board, lodging,

1013
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:13,081
- laundry washed and ironed.
- So what?

1014
00:58:13,127 --> 00:58:15,721
- .Half of it's mine.
- What? Are you mad?

1015
00:58:15,767 --> 00:58:18,884
At most, I can leave you
the ironing.

1016
00:58:18,927 --> 00:58:21,566
You can keep the ironing.
I must get 500 liras.

1017
00:58:21,607 --> 00:58:25,680
My friend, I work very hard
and sweat for this money!

1018
00:58:25,727 --> 00:58:27,877
- Felice!
- Coming! Do you get it now?

1019
00:58:28,207 --> 00:58:31,279
- I'm giving you nothing!
- Really? Fine!

1020
00:58:32,927 --> 00:58:37,364
Do you like this? I did all this
myself! I hung them one by one.

1021
00:58:37,487 --> 00:58:39,478
They look nice, don't they?

1022
00:58:39,527 --> 00:58:41,597
- Don Ignazio, here we are.
- The buffet has arrived!

1023
00:58:41,647 --> 00:58:43,478
Put everything here.

1024
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:49,485
- Here's the groom-to-be!
- At last!

1025
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:52,556
- Good evening, everybody!

1026
00:58:52,607 --> 00:58:54,598
Here I am!

1027
00:58:55,047 --> 00:58:58,039
Well? What does that mocking
sound mean?

1028
00:58:58,727 --> 00:59:01,799
Do you know who I am?
I'm Carluccio, "The Man of Iron".

1029
00:59:01,847 --> 00:59:05,601
Calm down, Carluccio.
Why ruin this lovely party?

1030
00:59:05,647 --> 00:59:07,877
You can thank the stars
that this is the evening...

1031
00:59:07,927 --> 00:59:09,565
...of my engagement and I want
to avoid a scandal.

1032
00:59:09,607 --> 00:59:12,201
- Where's the buffet?
- It's here. Everything's ready.

1033
00:59:12,247 --> 00:59:15,398
- Shall we open the packages?
- No, let's wait for Pasquale.

1034
00:59:15,447 --> 00:59:17,836
We're not going to eat with
Don Pasquale's mouth!

1035
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:20,647
I'm the fiance so
I must taste everything first.

1036
00:59:20,687 --> 00:59:22,678
- Yes, but you know that...
- The bride-to-be!

1037
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:24,479
Thank goodness! Now we can eat.

1038
00:59:27,927 --> 00:59:30,236
- Madam!
- Good evening.

1039
00:59:30,287 --> 00:59:32,676
Come, Pasquale. I want to show
you how I've decorated the room.

1040
00:59:32,727 --> 00:59:35,287
- Good evening!
- We were waiting for you.

1041
00:59:35,327 --> 00:59:37,477
- How lovely you look, Lisetta!
- Thank you.

1042
00:59:37,847 --> 00:59:40,486
- Why are you dressed up like that?
- How do I know? Ask Don Pasquale.

1043
00:59:46,287 --> 00:59:48,755
Donna Angelica, do you think
this is the way to receive people?

1044
00:59:48,807 --> 00:59:51,560
After all, we're the guests,
not Felice.

1045
00:59:51,607 --> 00:59:54,485
- I won't steal him from you.
- The fiancee is Lisetta, not me.

1046
00:59:54,607 --> 00:59:58,919
At last, my bride-to-be!

1047
00:59:59,247 --> 01:00:01,397
I was so looking forward
to seeing you.

1048
01:00:01,447 --> 01:00:05,235
Come here! Come to the buffet,
my love!

1049
01:00:05,287 --> 01:00:09,041
I'm not your wife yet. Who knows
who'll have the last word?

1050
01:00:09,487 --> 01:00:12,240
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, I did.

1051
01:00:12,287 --> 01:00:15,165
- This comment worries me.
- It's nothing, Carluccio.

1052
01:00:15,207 --> 01:00:18,165
She's just nervous..
She was dying to meet you.

1053
01:00:18,207 --> 01:00:20,880
Emotion got the better of her,
Carluccio. Calm down now.

1054
01:00:21,047 --> 01:00:23,925
What a hoot!

1055
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:30,875
Felice!

1056
01:00:31,167 --> 01:00:33,237
- Come here a moment.
- What's up?

1057
01:00:33,287 --> 01:00:36,120
Shall be create a scandal
now or later?

1058
01:00:36,167 --> 01:00:38,886
Later. Leave it to me.

1059
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:41,760
First, I want to prepare
the female public opinion.

1060
01:00:41,807 --> 01:00:43,479
- I'll take care of it.
- Felice!

1061
01:00:43,527 --> 01:00:45,677
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1062
01:00:45,727 --> 01:00:48,685
- How's it going at Don Pasquale's?
- Fine.

1063
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:53,319
In the morning, Concettina
brings me cafe au lait in bed!

1064
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:56,286
Don Ignazio...

1065
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:59,718
Should you have a falling out
come and work for me.

1066
01:01:00,087 --> 01:01:03,363
In the morning, I'll bring you
hot chocolate and cookies.

1067
01:01:03,407 --> 01:01:05,045
- In bed?
- In bed.

1068
01:01:05,087 --> 01:01:08,557
Will you bring them personally?
It wouldn't be worth my while.

1069
01:01:08,727 --> 01:01:11,321
- Uncle Ignazio!
- Coming! What's up?

1070
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:15,881
This evening
everyone's interested in the Turk.

1071
01:01:16,247 --> 01:01:18,886
Are we going to draw up
this betrothal contract or not?

1072
01:01:18,927 --> 01:01:21,236
of course we will,
but we're waiting for the Deputy.

1073
01:01:21,287 --> 01:01:23,801
Then in the meantime, let's eat
something from the buffet!

1074
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:26,566
- Without the Deputy?! No!
- How inelegant we'd look!

1075
01:01:26,607 --> 01:01:29,405
No contract, no food...
What are supposed to do?

1076
01:01:29,447 --> 01:01:33,360
Would you like some music?
Music, maestro!

1077
01:01:38,407 --> 01:01:40,967
Oh, what fun! Felice,
sing us this song!

1078
01:01:41,007 --> 01:01:43,396
- No, I can't!
- Yes you can!

1079
01:01:43,447 --> 01:01:46,245
No I can't
I sing like a Turk!

1080
01:01:46,287 --> 01:01:48,403
Fine! Then sing it
Turkish style!

1081
01:01:48,447 --> 01:01:51,996
I sing like a Turk who won't
sing even to save his skin.

1082
01:01:52,047 --> 01:01:54,561
Salvatore's a good singer.

1083
01:01:54,607 --> 01:01:56,518
- Me?! No, Don Pasquale!
- Go on!

1084
01:01:56,567 --> 01:01:59,035
Sing, Salvatore!

1085
01:01:59,927 --> 01:02:03,966
This year,
spring has entered my heart.

1086
01:02:04,007 --> 01:02:07,477
I feel a longing to make love as
if I still had the fire of youth.

1087
01:02:07,527 --> 01:02:11,361
Whenever I see a girl,
my blood starts heating up,

1088
01:02:11,407 --> 01:02:14,763
my knees shake
and I don't understand anything.

1089
01:02:14,807 --> 01:02:18,595
Carmela, Carmela,

1090
01:02:18,927 --> 01:02:22,317
one of you isn't enough,
I need three.

1091
01:02:22,367 --> 01:02:25,803
Carmela, Carmela,

1092
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:29,637
I'm a good-hearted man,
I'll satisfy all three of you.

1093
01:02:29,687 --> 01:02:33,157
Carmela, Carmela,

1094
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:37,037
I didn't choose to be like this
and I want you to know it.

1095
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:41,046
Carmela, Carmela,

1096
01:02:41,207 --> 01:02:44,677
I'm very hard-headed.

1097
01:02:47,287 --> 01:02:51,166
"Three wives for every man".
The paper said they'll pass

1098
01:02:51,207 --> 01:02:54,802
a special law.
Do you know why?

1099
01:02:54,847 --> 01:02:58,522
Because there are few men
but a large number of women.

1100
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:02,003
I want to have a baby
but not only with you.

1101
01:03:02,047 --> 01:03:05,835
Carmela, Carmela

1102
01:03:06,207 --> 01:03:09,483
you alone aren't enough for me,
I need three women.

1103
01:03:09,527 --> 01:03:13,202
Carmela, Carmela,

1104
01:03:13,687 --> 01:03:16,997
I'm a good-hearted man,
I'll satisfy all three of you.

1105
01:03:17,047 --> 01:03:21,040
Carmela, Carmela,

1106
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:24,477
I didn't choose to be like this
and I want you to know it.

1107
01:03:24,527 --> 01:03:28,281
Carmela, Carmela,

1108
01:03:28,487 --> 01:03:31,923
I'm very heard-headed.

1109
01:03:37,327 --> 01:03:39,966
I'm sorry,
but I can't let you in.

1110
01:03:40,007 --> 01:03:43,044
This is a family party. Outsiders
can't be admitted.

1111
01:03:43,087 --> 01:03:45,476
It's just a matter of a few
minutes. Call Don Pasquale.

1112
01:03:45,527 --> 01:03:48,246
I must offer him a deal.
5 minutes, then I'll be off.

1113
01:03:48,287 --> 01:03:52,246
Do you think Don Pasquale will
leave the party to talk business?

1114
01:03:52,927 --> 01:03:56,920
Stop by his store tomorrow,
then you can talk business.

1115
01:03:57,047 --> 01:03:59,277
Very well. I'll put it off
till tomorrow. Goodbye.

1116
01:03:59,327 --> 01:04:01,716
- Goodbye.
- You're too zealous.

1117
01:04:05,527 --> 01:04:07,916
Stop! Ladies!
Where do you think you are?

1118
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:11,486
I'll satisfy all of you
one at a time.

1119
01:04:11,527 --> 01:04:13,961
The Turk is here
at your service. One dance each.

1120
01:04:14,007 --> 01:04:15,838
- Good for you!
- Well done!

1121
01:04:15,887 --> 01:04:18,481
- The lady of the house.
- Here she is! My wife!

1122
01:04:18,847 --> 01:04:21,919
First the lady of the house.

1123
01:04:21,967 --> 01:04:24,162
Music, maestro, please.

1124
01:04:49,847 --> 01:04:52,725
What a great guy!
He's so helpful!

1125
01:04:52,767 --> 01:04:54,917
He never backs out of anything.

1126
01:04:55,207 --> 01:04:58,324
Don Felice!
How strong you are!

1127
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,835
My destiny from birth was
to be strong.

1128
01:05:00,887 --> 01:05:03,242
I have the force
of destiny.

1129
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:38,877
Don Felice!
Ever since I've known you,

1130
01:05:38,927 --> 01:05:41,885
- I've been sorry to be a lady.
- Would you like to be a young man?

1131
01:05:42,487 --> 01:05:45,718
Donna Giulietta,
I like you just the way you are.

1132
01:05:45,767 --> 01:05:48,520
Really?
What do you like about me?

1133
01:05:48,567 --> 01:05:51,081
- Do you really want to know
- Yes..

1134
01:05:51,127 --> 01:05:53,846
- Your daughter.
- My daughter?

1135
01:05:53,887 --> 01:05:55,878
- Yes, your step-daughter.
- My step-daughter?

1136
01:05:55,927 --> 01:05:58,077
- Yes.
- What do you like about her?

1137
01:05:58,127 --> 01:06:00,925
Her step, I mean
her step-mother. You!

1138
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:06,356
I'm afraid he'll overtire
himself.

1139
01:06:06,407 --> 01:06:08,557
He's not like other men.

1140
01:06:11,527 --> 01:06:14,837
Don Felice, you like
all women.

1141
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:18,482
Donna Giulietta, women are
fickle and I like fickle people!

1142
01:06:59,207 --> 01:07:01,675
There they are! They're here.

1143
01:07:05,687 --> 01:07:08,485
The Deputy!
The Deputy's arriving!

1144
01:07:08,527 --> 01:07:10,597
The Deputy!

1145
01:07:10,647 --> 01:07:13,320
Remember that everyone here
thinks you're my wife,

1146
01:07:13,367 --> 01:07:17,406
so don't make any gaffes.
Just answer "Yes, thank you".

1147
01:07:17,447 --> 01:07:20,564
Long live the Deputy!

1148
01:07:21,487 --> 01:07:23,478
- Welcome!
- Thank you.

1149
01:07:27,487 --> 01:07:29,478
- This is my wife.
- Pleased to meet you.

1150
01:07:29,527 --> 01:07:31,483
- The pleasure's all mine.
- Long live the Deputy!

1151
01:07:31,527 --> 01:07:34,803
- I'm so pleased to see you.
- You wife may want to freshen up...

1152
01:07:34,847 --> 01:07:38,681
Of course! To tell the truth
we drove a little too fast.

1153
01:07:38,967 --> 01:07:41,481
You won't believe it,

1154
01:07:41,527 --> 01:07:43,961
but on some stretches,
with this car,

1155
01:07:44,007 --> 01:07:46,999
I did 25 kilometers per hour.

1156
01:07:47,047 --> 01:07:49,766
What a daredevil!

1157
01:07:49,807 --> 01:07:52,844
- What's happening? What is it?
- It's nothing.

1158
01:07:52,887 --> 01:07:56,038
It's just the last residue
of gas in the engine.

1159
01:07:56,087 --> 01:08:00,126
- Come, Deputy.
- My house is at your disposal.

1160
01:08:00,167 --> 01:08:03,159
Long live the Deputy!

1161
01:08:07,047 --> 01:08:09,163
At last, we can eat!

1162
01:08:12,767 --> 01:08:15,281
The Deputy is here!

1163
01:08:15,327 --> 01:08:18,239
Use my bedroom.
You'll be more comfortable there.

1164
01:08:18,287 --> 01:08:20,847
- Thank you.
- Angelica, show her the way.

1165
01:08:20,887 --> 01:08:23,276
No, just a moment.
I'll have Felice accompany her.

1166
01:08:23,327 --> 01:08:25,602
Felice!

1167
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:29,526
- Why him, specifically?
- I can accompany her.

1168
01:08:29,687 --> 01:08:32,645
- Don't feel ashamed.
- I'm scared. He's a deputy.

1169
01:08:33,047 --> 01:08:36,323
- I'm ashamed. No!
- Come on! Accompany her!

1170
01:08:36,367 --> 01:08:39,598
Is this the lady?
This way, madam.

1171
01:08:41,927 --> 01:08:44,725
There's no need for you to go too.
Felice will look after her.

1172
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,839
Wouldn't it have been better
to have a woman accompany her?

1173
01:08:47,887 --> 01:08:51,277
No, Deputy! Felice
is the man for the job.

1174
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,158
Who is Felice?

1175
01:08:53,207 --> 01:08:55,277
He's the Turk you sent me.

1176
01:08:55,327 --> 01:08:58,160
Ah! Now I get it.

1177
01:08:58,487 --> 01:09:01,285
- So there's nothing to worry about.
- Nothing at all.

1178
01:09:01,327 --> 01:09:03,682
Dear Deputy,
I must thank you...

1179
01:09:03,727 --> 01:09:06,321
...for the great favor you did me
in sending me the Turk!

1180
01:09:06,367 --> 01:09:08,801
That's right, Deputy.
Do rest assured...

1181
01:09:08,847 --> 01:09:11,156
...you wife's in safe hands

1182
01:09:12,167 --> 01:09:14,886
- May I? Yes?
- Yes, thank you.

1183
01:09:14,927 --> 01:09:16,918
"Yes, thank you"?
Goodness me!

1184
01:09:17,607 --> 01:09:19,962
Then I'll close the door.
I've closed it.

1185
01:09:20,047 --> 01:09:22,607
What a lot of dust!

1186
01:09:22,647 --> 01:09:26,322
You're covered in dust!
Completely covered in dust!

1187
01:09:27,687 --> 01:09:30,076
Take this off!

1188
01:09:30,247 --> 01:09:34,479
Where did it land?

1189
01:09:35,567 --> 01:09:39,355
It's inevitable with these
adventurous journeys by car!

1190
01:09:39,407 --> 01:09:42,479
These crazy cars
they've invented... Look!

1191
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:46,122
Around here the roads are terrible,
full of bends...

1192
01:09:47,247 --> 01:09:50,125
This is dust
you picked up on the bends.

1193
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:55,317
My dear lady, this isn't a dress.
It's a dust bowl!

1194
01:09:55,407 --> 01:09:58,126
- Yes, thank you.
- It's a dust bowl.

1195
01:09:58,847 --> 01:10:02,203
I've just one suggestion.
Undress!

1196
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:05,196
I don't understand.

1197
01:10:05,247 --> 01:10:07,602
I can't do it on my own.

1198
01:10:07,647 --> 01:10:10,366
Of course you can't do it
on your own. That's why I'm here!

1199
01:10:10,407 --> 01:10:13,001
They pay me. I get my laundry
ironed in exchange for this.

1200
01:10:13,047 --> 01:10:15,322
- I'll help you, all right?
- Yes.

1201
01:10:15,367 --> 01:10:18,165
I'll help you.

1202
01:10:21,767 --> 01:10:24,964
You even have dust on
your skin.

1203
01:10:27,487 --> 01:10:29,557
99!

1204
01:10:30,247 --> 01:10:34,798
Deputy, the next time you must
return to the Chamber as minister!

1205
01:10:35,807 --> 01:10:38,719
Dear Don Pasquale,
you're very kind,

1206
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:40,758
but maybe I'm not worthy.

1207
01:10:40,807 --> 01:10:44,561
- As an under-secretary, then!
- No! Either a minister or nothing!

1208
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:46,996
So, let's drink to the health of
the Minister

1209
01:10:47,047 --> 01:10:49,356
- Long live the Minister!
- Long may he live!

1210
01:10:49,407 --> 01:10:52,319
- Uncle Ignazio!
- I'm coming Excuse me.

1211
01:10:53,567 --> 01:10:56,843
- Aren't we performing the ceremony?
- I'm waiting for the Deputy's wife.

1212
01:10:56,887 --> 01:10:59,355
In the meantime, shall we put in
writing the matter of my free meal?

1213
01:10:59,407 --> 01:11:02,240
- No. Do you think it's necessary?
- Of course it is!

1214
01:11:02,287 --> 01:11:04,084
Notary, write this down.

1215
01:11:04,367 --> 01:11:08,121
- Dishes that I don't like.
- Fads...

1216
01:11:08,367 --> 01:11:11,006
Potatoes with pork fat.

1217
01:11:11,327 --> 01:11:13,318
With lard.

1218
01:11:14,047 --> 01:11:16,686
Pickled courgettes.

1219
01:11:17,287 --> 01:11:19,482
Pickled courgettes.

1220
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:33,677
That face looks familiar.
Where have I seen it before?

1221
01:11:34,727 --> 01:11:38,720
Madam, washing like that
serves no purpose.

1222
01:11:39,607 --> 01:11:42,280
You're covered in dust.
It's gotten in everywhere.

1223
01:11:42,327 --> 01:11:46,366
What the Ghibli blowing?
It has covered your skin..

1224
01:11:47,287 --> 01:11:50,962
Your clothes are full of dust
in the seams, everywhere!

1225
01:11:51,647 --> 01:11:53,558
There's only one thing to be done.

1226
01:11:53,887 --> 01:11:58,915
Take everything off. Let's
lather you up all over!

1227
01:11:58,967 --> 01:12:01,765
Shall we get you nice and soapy?

1228
01:12:02,727 --> 01:12:08,279
Madam, you're French,
I'm Turkish... Let's fraternize.

1229
01:12:08,607 --> 01:12:11,997
Give me a hug,
my Latin sister!

1230
01:12:12,367 --> 01:12:14,358
Latin sister!

1231
01:12:15,927 --> 01:12:18,316
You're not a real Turk!

1232
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:20,961
Of course I'm not a Turk.
I'm Neapolitan.

1233
01:12:21,967 --> 01:12:23,685
And proud of it!

1234
01:12:24,127 --> 01:12:27,403
- I adore Neapolitans.
- I don't understand, Madam..

1235
01:12:27,447 --> 01:12:30,962
- I adore Neapolitans!
- Really? You adore Neapolitans?

1236
01:12:31,207 --> 01:12:34,165
And I adore women like you.
And how!

1237
01:12:34,887 --> 01:12:37,560
Occupied!

1238
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:40,645
We're not in. We're out.

1239
01:12:40,687 --> 01:12:43,485
Look in some other room.
He often wanders around the house.

1240
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,722
We came to see
if you need anything.

1241
01:12:53,767 --> 01:12:56,201
No, no. The Turk knows how to do
everything.

1242
01:12:57,167 --> 01:12:59,727
I do what I can.
I get by. You can leave us.

1243
01:12:59,767 --> 01:13:01,678
We're aware that you know
how to do everything.

1244
01:13:01,727 --> 01:13:04,878
Madam, your husband is getting
impatient. He's waiting for you.

1245
01:13:04,927 --> 01:13:07,157
Fine! I'll be right down.

1246
01:13:07,567 --> 01:13:11,242
Do go, dear ladies. As soon as
she's dressed, she'll come down.

1247
01:13:15,527 --> 01:13:18,246
- Here, Deputy, have a cookie.
- Oh, no thank you.

1248
01:13:18,287 --> 01:13:20,403
They're a specialty of Sorrento!
Taste how good they are!

1249
01:13:20,447 --> 01:13:23,007
Uncle Ignazio!
That's it! I've had enough!

1250
01:13:23,047 --> 01:13:25,515
- Are we having the ceremony or not?
- Why wouldn't we?

1251
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:28,604
Go and call the bride, otherwise
he'll do something crazy!

1252
01:13:28,647 --> 01:13:30,842
- Right away! Concettina!
- Yes, sir?

1253
01:13:30,887 --> 01:13:33,355
- Bring the bride here!
- I'll go and get her.

1254
01:13:33,407 --> 01:13:37,036
- Otherwise, what'll I do?
- Stay calm.

1255
01:13:37,087 --> 01:13:40,557
Here she is. Come, my dear.

1256
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:44,043
Here's your bride!

1257
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:47,204
Don't call me that!
I'll never marry him! No! No! No!

1258
01:13:47,247 --> 01:13:49,966
- Lisetta, what are you saying?
- Did I hear correctly?

1259
01:13:50,007 --> 01:13:52,601
I'll never marry you not even
if you drag me to the altar!

1260
01:13:52,647 --> 01:13:55,923
You have the courage to tell
me to my face...

1261
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,958
...that you won't marry me
even if I drag you to the altar?

1262
01:13:58,007 --> 01:14:00,316
- Don Carluccio, calm down..
- Get out of here!

1263
01:14:00,367 --> 01:14:03,643
Donna Lisetta,
you're finished!

1264
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:07,075
Prepare your tomb,
Donna Lisetta!

1265
01:14:07,127 --> 01:14:09,800
It's no use. I've created a
scandal and I won't marry you.

1266
01:14:09,847 --> 01:14:12,998
Fine!
Then call the undertakers'.

1267
01:14:13,047 --> 01:14:15,481
"Tomorrow, in Sorrento,
the funeral of Donna Lisetta"!

1268
01:14:15,527 --> 01:14:18,485
No, Carluccio, stop that!
Calm down. Do it for me.

1269
01:14:18,527 --> 01:14:20,597
- Uncle, I'm doing it for you.
- Thank you.

1270
01:14:20,647 --> 01:14:23,639
Pasquale, don't think
this is the end of it.

1271
01:14:23,687 --> 01:14:29,080
Tomorrow morning, I'll come by
and there'll be hell to pay!

1272
01:14:29,167 --> 01:14:32,955
Let me through!
Out of the way! Out of the way!

1273
01:14:33,407 --> 01:14:35,398
- Why did you act like that?
- Don Felice told me to.

1274
01:14:35,447 --> 01:14:37,961
- Don Felice?!
- Come! Explain everything to me.

1275
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:40,363
Waiter?!

1276
01:14:41,727 --> 01:14:45,606
Can you tell me where
Donna Angelica's room is?

1277
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:49,276
Yes, it's down there.

1278
01:14:49,327 --> 01:14:52,285
The second door.

1279
01:14:53,167 --> 01:14:57,763
Pasquale, who'll reimburse me
all these expenses?

1280
01:14:57,807 --> 01:15:00,605
- What expenses?
- All the lights...

1281
01:15:00,647 --> 01:15:03,480
4 candles and 2 glasses
of water? Give me a break!

1282
01:15:03,527 --> 01:15:07,315
Ladies and gentlemen the reception
is over. The exit is this way.

1283
01:15:07,367 --> 01:15:09,642
Good evening. Good evening.

1284
01:15:15,807 --> 01:15:17,957
My dear!

1285
01:15:21,287 --> 01:15:23,926
What's going on?
I want an explanation.

1286
01:15:24,007 --> 01:15:26,282
- What are you doing?
- This.

1287
01:15:26,327 --> 01:15:29,239
- You're not the Turk..
- Why? Don't Turks do it?

1288
01:15:29,287 --> 01:15:32,757
- I mean... You're not the Turk.
- Are you Turkish?

1289
01:15:32,807 --> 01:15:34,718
- Am I Turkish?
- I don't know. Are you Turkish?

1290
01:15:34,767 --> 01:15:36,485
- You say you are.
- Am I Turkish?

1291
01:15:36,527 --> 01:15:38,483
- You're Turkish.
- You're Turkish.

1292
01:15:38,527 --> 01:15:40,563
I'm not Turkish!
Let's not get confused!

1293
01:15:40,607 --> 01:15:42,484
- Let's clear the matter up!
- Very well.

1294
01:15:42,527 --> 01:15:44,597
- If there's a Turk here...
- That's me.

1295
01:15:44,647 --> 01:15:47,525
No! What are you making me say?
No way am I a Turk!

1296
01:15:47,727 --> 01:15:50,287
I'm not Turkish,
but neither are you.

1297
01:15:50,327 --> 01:15:53,558
If you're not the Turk,
why are you hugging my wife?

1298
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:57,726
Sorry!

1299
01:16:00,207 --> 01:16:02,926
- Dear Cocchetelli...
- Cocchetelli?

1300
01:16:02,967 --> 01:16:05,481
- Don't be so formal.
- I don't want to get chummy!

1301
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:07,483
What airs you give yourself!

1302
01:16:07,527 --> 01:16:10,485
- Call me Deputy.
- Deputy..

1303
01:16:10,527 --> 01:16:12,836
- Carry on.
- Let's talk man to man.

1304
01:16:12,887 --> 01:16:17,005
I may not be Turkish
but them she's not your wife.

1305
01:16:17,127 --> 01:16:20,483
What do you mean?
I swear she's my wife.

1306
01:16:20,527 --> 01:16:22,483
- The Deputy is a liar.
- Why?

1307
01:16:22,527 --> 01:16:25,121
- You'll go to Hell..
- What do you know?

1308
01:16:25,167 --> 01:16:28,045
For various reasons, she's not your
wife. Firstly, she speaks French.

1309
01:16:28,087 --> 01:16:30,078
- What's that to do with it?
- Secondly, she doesn't wear a ring.

1310
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:34,405
Thirdly, I recognized her face.

1311
01:16:34,567 --> 01:16:38,401
I've seen her dancing the can-can
at the Salone Margherita theater.

1312
01:16:38,447 --> 01:16:41,007
Then there's another thing
that clinches it.

1313
01:16:41,047 --> 01:16:43,880
- And what would that be?
- Listen to me.

1314
01:16:43,927 --> 01:16:47,556
A cute face like that,
a pretty girl like that,

1315
01:16:47,607 --> 01:16:50,679
would never marry
a man as ugly as you

1316
01:16:50,727 --> 01:16:53,480
even if that man
is a member of parliament!

1317
01:16:53,527 --> 01:16:55,563
That's enough! won't be
blackmailed by anyone!

1318
01:16:55,607 --> 01:17:00,635
Stop now, honey!

1319
01:17:00,687 --> 01:17:03,201
I'm thinking of Don Pasquale,

1320
01:17:03,247 --> 01:17:06,125
who thinks he has a Turk in
his house but he doesn't!

1321
01:17:06,167 --> 01:17:08,362
- That's true.
- What a fine mess!

1322
01:17:08,407 --> 01:17:10,921
- He thinks that...
- How dim I look! I recommended you.

1323
01:17:11,487 --> 01:17:15,719
- And you have the cheek to laugh?
- The issue itself makes me laugh.

1324
01:17:15,767 --> 01:17:18,201
- You'll soon stop laughing.
- Why?

1325
01:17:18,247 --> 01:17:20,397
Why?
Do you know what I'll do?

1326
01:17:20,447 --> 01:17:22,677
I'll go to Don Pasquale
and tell him the whole truth.

1327
01:17:22,727 --> 01:17:25,400
Carry on laughing.

1328
01:17:26,607 --> 01:17:28,643
What are you doing?

1329
01:17:28,767 --> 01:17:31,076
- You won't be laughing much longer.
- I'm getting convulsions!

1330
01:17:31,127 --> 01:17:34,802
- You can't go to Don Pasquale.
- Really? And why not?

1331
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:37,600
Don Pasquale is a very correct
person, an honorable man

1332
01:17:37,647 --> 01:17:40,639
who puts his home and his family
first, is that clear?

1333
01:17:40,687 --> 01:17:44,077
In Sorrento, everyone votes for
whoever Don Pasquale votes for.

1334
01:17:44,127 --> 01:17:46,516
- They vote following his vote.
- I see.

1335
01:17:46,567 --> 01:17:49,559
When Pasquale finds out
you were a guest in his house...

1336
01:17:49,607 --> 01:17:51,757
not with your wife
but your mistress,

1337
01:17:51,807 --> 01:17:56,164
he'll be upset and will get
everyone to vote for your rival.

1338
01:17:56,207 --> 01:17:58,516
I think he's right.

1339
01:17:58,567 --> 01:18:01,479
- You're on his side too!
- I am right.

1340
01:18:01,527 --> 01:18:05,361
- This is blackmail!
- Sometimes, it's a necessary evil.

1341
01:18:05,407 --> 01:18:09,195
But I assure you that
I cannot be blackmailed.

1342
01:18:09,247 --> 01:18:12,762
Then let's go to Don
Pasquale. Don Pasquale!

1343
01:18:12,927 --> 01:18:15,521
Just a moment!
What a hurry you're in! Come here.

1344
01:18:15,567 --> 01:18:18,081
It's best to think things over.

1345
01:18:18,127 --> 01:18:20,118
- Let's go to Don Pasquale.
- No, just a moment.

1346
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:23,876
I'll have to sacrifice myself
for the good of the nation.

1347
01:18:24,487 --> 01:18:27,923
The nation needs me and
I'll make this sacrifice.

1348
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:31,284
I'll speak with him but not now.
We'll talk about it in the morning.

1349
01:18:31,327 --> 01:18:34,000
Yes, we'll talk about it in
the morning. Very well.

1350
01:18:34,407 --> 01:18:36,875
- Would you mind leaving now?
- Who?

1351
01:18:36,927 --> 01:18:39,600
- You.
- Come off it!

1352
01:18:39,647 --> 01:18:41,603
- Excuse me?
- Cocchetelli!

1353
01:18:41,647 --> 01:18:44,161
- Cocchetelli!
- Deputy Cocchetelli, if you please!

1354
01:18:44,487 --> 01:18:46,842
- Deputy...
- Leave now.

1355
01:18:46,887 --> 01:18:49,481
- Let's fall in with the situation.
- What do you mean?

1356
01:18:49,527 --> 01:18:53,805
The lady must get dressed.
I must help her.

1357
01:18:53,847 --> 01:18:55,883
- You!
- You're not her husband,

1358
01:18:55,927 --> 01:19:00,159
so, therefore, consequently,
you can't.

1359
01:19:00,207 --> 01:19:02,801
I'm not allowing you to dress her!
Get out of here!

1360
01:19:02,847 --> 01:19:05,566
Then I'll go to Don Pasquale.
Don Pasquale!

1361
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:07,643
No! That's not what I meant.

1362
01:19:07,687 --> 01:19:10,485
I said I couldn't allow it
however...

1363
01:19:10,887 --> 01:19:13,765
...I'll make this sacrifice
for the good of the nation.

1364
01:19:13,807 --> 01:19:15,718
The nation will be grateful
to you.

1365
01:19:15,767 --> 01:19:18,565
Yes, but remember
that's not the end of it.

1366
01:19:19,327 --> 01:19:21,363
- Take this.
- Thank you.

1367
01:19:27,727 --> 01:19:29,718
Put your legs up.

1368
01:19:32,087 --> 01:19:35,284
He gave me a note
challenging me.

1369
01:19:37,607 --> 01:19:39,882
Oh! It's something different!

1370
01:19:40,047 --> 01:19:43,960
"Vote for the Honorable
Enrico Cocchetelli. "

1371
01:19:44,767 --> 01:19:47,156
Right! Votes are secret.

1372
01:19:47,327 --> 01:19:49,477
Honey, to the polls!

1373
01:19:57,847 --> 01:19:59,838
Deputy, we're pleased
to have you among us.

1374
01:20:00,007 --> 01:20:02,646
The pleasure's all mine.
- A cup of hot chocolate?

1375
01:20:03,167 --> 01:20:05,806
- Please don't put yourself out.
- It's no trouble at all.

1376
01:20:06,247 --> 01:20:10,843
Thank you. Of course,
having a Turk in the house,

1377
01:20:10,887 --> 01:20:12,878
dear Don Pasquale,
is a real stroke of luck.

1378
01:20:12,927 --> 01:20:15,680
Actually, I wanted to keep
Felice to myself,

1379
01:20:15,727 --> 01:20:18,639
but then, to help a friend
like yourself...

1380
01:20:18,687 --> 01:20:21,645
- You're too kind.
- It's true.

1381
01:20:21,967 --> 01:20:25,243
The Deputy is a really
fine person

1382
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:30,602
Madam, you're fortunate
to have a husband like him.

1383
01:20:30,647 --> 01:20:33,241
Don Pasquale! Excuse me.

1384
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:35,755
- A gentleman's asking for you.
- Later, later!.

1385
01:20:35,807 --> 01:20:38,526
- He says it's urgent.
- Then I'll be right down.

1386
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:40,683
- Please excuse me a moment.
- But of course.

1387
01:20:40,727 --> 01:20:42,922
- Would you like a rum baba?
- No, thank you.

1388
01:20:42,967 --> 01:20:45,356
- I made them myself.
- Really?

1389
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:47,477
Then they must be delicious.

1390
01:20:48,287 --> 01:20:50,596
This chocolate is very good,
isn't it, dear?

1391
01:20:50,647 --> 01:20:53,161
Good morning.
You wanted to speak with me?

1392
01:20:53,327 --> 01:20:56,125
- I want to offer you a deal..
- A deal?

1393
01:20:56,287 --> 01:20:58,881
If I help you save
1,000 liras a month,

1394
01:20:58,927 --> 01:21:01,646
- you give me 500.
- How does it work?

1395
01:21:01,687 --> 01:21:05,043
It's very simple. You're paying
a salary of 1,000 liras...

1396
01:21:05,087 --> 01:21:08,124
to a person who came into your home
under false pretences.

1397
01:21:08,767 --> 01:21:11,600
- Tell me more!
- Are we agreed on the 500 liras?

1398
01:21:11,647 --> 01:21:13,478
Agreed!

1399
01:21:14,167 --> 01:21:16,806
- Now...
- Would you like some hot chocolate?

1400
01:21:16,847 --> 01:21:19,281
No, chocolate no.
It makes me hot.

1401
01:21:19,327 --> 01:21:21,477
It's delicious.
- A rum baba?

1402
01:21:21,527 --> 01:21:24,758
One rum baba from both of you.
A half from each one.

1403
01:21:26,967 --> 01:21:30,357
Where is he? Out of here!
Get away from him! Leave him!

1404
01:21:30,407 --> 01:21:33,080
I know what you're up to.
You're no Turk.

1405
01:21:33,127 --> 01:21:35,277
- What?
- You're not Turkish!

1406
01:21:35,327 --> 01:21:38,319
What? I'm not Turkish?
I even have turquoise eyes!

1407
01:21:38,367 --> 01:21:40,358
I'm a heavy smoker! I smoke like
a Turk, so I'm Turkish!

1408
01:21:40,407 --> 01:21:44,116
I'm not falling for it! Come away!
Lock yourselves in your rooms.

1409
01:21:44,807 --> 01:21:47,002
- Where are you going?
- To lock myself in with them.

1410
01:21:47,047 --> 01:21:49,880
You're staying here!
And you, Deputy!

1411
01:21:50,007 --> 01:21:52,680
You shouldn't have played
this trick on me.

1412
01:21:52,727 --> 01:21:55,195
Don Pasquale,
I assure you, I swear...

1413
01:21:55,247 --> 01:21:57,317
You shouldn't have done this
to me.

1414
01:21:57,367 --> 01:22:00,359
- Nobody move!
- What do you want?

1415
01:22:00,887 --> 01:22:02,878
- Quiet!
- Quiet!

1416
01:22:02,927 --> 01:22:04,758
- I'm here!
- He's here!

1417
01:22:05,167 --> 01:22:07,476
Don Pasquale, I'm here about
what happened yesterday evening.

1418
01:22:07,527 --> 01:22:10,405
All of Sorrento knows about
the affront I suffered...

1419
01:22:10,447 --> 01:22:13,484
and everybody's waiting to see
what will happen.

1420
01:22:13,727 --> 01:22:16,878
I have to do something.
I must kill someone.

1421
01:22:16,967 --> 01:22:19,481
What can I do if Lisetta
doesn't want you?

1422
01:22:19,527 --> 01:22:21,643
Lisetta "must" want me.

1423
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:24,485
Young man, Lisetta
doesn't want to marry you.

1424
01:22:24,527 --> 01:22:27,041
- Why?
- 'Cause she wants to marry another.

1425
01:22:27,087 --> 01:22:30,363
That makes me laugh!

1426
01:22:30,407 --> 01:22:32,477
Laughter's good for your health.

1427
01:22:32,607 --> 01:22:36,395
If Lisetta wants to marry another,
she'll be marrying a corpse.

1428
01:22:36,447 --> 01:22:38,802
In that case...

1429
01:22:38,847 --> 01:22:40,599
- Get out.
- Get out?

1430
01:22:40,647 --> 01:22:42,683
- Uncle, did you hear that?
- Yes, I heard that.

1431
01:22:42,727 --> 01:22:44,479
- Auntie, did you hear that?
- Yes.

1432
01:22:44,527 --> 01:22:47,087
- Pasquale, did you hear that?
- Yes, of course...

1433
01:22:47,367 --> 01:22:49,085
They heard it.

1434
01:22:49,127 --> 01:22:51,561
- Did you all hear it?
- They all heard it!

1435
01:22:51,607 --> 01:22:54,041
- I heard it too..
- Right! Get out!

1436
01:22:54,287 --> 01:22:56,482
He said it again.!
Uncle Ignazio, did you hear that?

1437
01:22:56,527 --> 01:22:58,483
- Yes, I heard it.
- Aunt Angelica, did you hear that?

1438
01:22:58,527 --> 01:23:00,279
- Yes.
- What about you, Don Pasquale?

1439
01:23:00,327 --> 01:23:02,283
Everybody heard it!

1440
01:23:02,967 --> 01:23:04,923
What can I say?

1441
01:23:05,407 --> 01:23:07,796
- I shall...

1442
01:23:07,847 --> 01:23:10,680
I feel sorry for you
because you're not from Sorrento.

1443
01:23:10,727 --> 01:23:13,719
You certainly don't know
I'm Carluccio "The Man of Iron".

1444
01:23:15,207 --> 01:23:17,801
See this tray?

1445
01:23:20,407 --> 01:23:22,875
You're a man of steel?
See this tray?

1446
01:23:22,927 --> 01:23:25,805
See it? See it?

1447
01:23:27,647 --> 01:23:30,036
- What are you planning to do?
- What am I planning? Turn around.

1448
01:23:32,887 --> 01:23:35,196
- What was that?
- A kick.

1449
01:23:35,247 --> 01:23:38,478
- Uncle, did you see that?
- Pasquale did you see that?

1450
01:23:38,527 --> 01:23:40,597
French Miss, did you see that?
Concettina, did you see that?

1451
01:23:40,647 --> 01:23:43,798
- But he felt it.
- Well done!

1452
01:23:43,927 --> 01:23:46,487
Well done!
You gave me a kick!

1453
01:23:46,527 --> 01:23:49,485
- What do you want to do now?
- What do I want to do? This!

1454
01:23:51,887 --> 01:23:54,276
The man of iron has lost
a tooth of steel!

1455
01:23:54,487 --> 01:23:57,126
I'm going to the dentist
to have it examined...

1456
01:23:57,247 --> 01:24:01,559
...and if, by chance,
this tooth has no cavity,

1457
01:24:01,927 --> 01:24:04,487
- there'll be hell to pay for.
- Don't make me laugh!

1458
01:24:26,607 --> 01:24:28,518
What a funny guy!

1459
01:24:29,527 --> 01:24:33,076
- He's certainly no Turk!
- You're right, Pasquale.

1460
01:24:33,127 --> 01:24:36,199
I'm not a real Turk..
I'm a Neapolitan Turk.

1461
01:24:36,287 --> 01:24:39,916
But I'm a gentleman
and a fine person.

1462
01:24:39,967 --> 01:24:42,686
No, Deputy! Deputy!

1463
01:24:43,567 --> 01:24:46,798
The Deputy has nothing to do
with this affair.

1464
01:24:46,847 --> 01:24:49,042
- He knew nothing about it.
- Oh, thank goodness!

1465
01:24:49,087 --> 01:24:51,601
- The cross!
- What are you doing?

1466
01:24:52,367 --> 01:24:54,642
Goodness, there are two of them!

1467
01:24:54,687 --> 01:24:58,043
One's for Don Pasquale
and one's for Don Ignazio.

1468
01:24:58,087 --> 01:25:00,965
Here you are. I must
request something of you.

1469
01:25:01,087 --> 01:25:02,964
- Be less stingy.
- Am I stingy?!

1470
01:25:03,007 --> 01:25:06,238
Yes! Extremely stingy
As for you, Don Pasquale,

1471
01:25:06,287 --> 01:25:08,676
I mean Cavaliere,

1472
01:25:08,727 --> 01:25:12,720
don't ruin your health
with this absurd jealousy.

1473
01:25:12,767 --> 01:25:15,156
Give your wife
a little freedom.

1474
01:25:15,207 --> 01:25:18,040
Let her have fun.
Nothing bad will come of it.

1475
01:25:18,087 --> 01:25:20,521
As for Lisetta. let her
marry whomever she likes.

1476
01:25:20,567 --> 01:25:23,400
Women like men who are
romantic, poetic, like themselves.

1477
01:25:23,447 --> 01:25:25,722
Wait! Come here.

1478
01:25:26,047 --> 01:25:29,198
In this store,
among all the dried figs,

1479
01:25:29,247 --> 01:25:32,125
a little poetry would be nice.
Not out of place.

1480
01:25:32,487 --> 01:25:35,638
Moreover, we'll all help
the Deputy at the next elections.

1481
01:25:35,687 --> 01:25:38,759
The lady's leaving tomorrow.
She's going back to Paris.

1482
01:25:38,807 --> 01:25:41,116
- Actually, she's not...
- The lady is returning to Paris.

1483
01:25:41,167 --> 01:25:43,476
- Think of the next elections.
- Very well. She's leaving.

1484
01:25:43,527 --> 01:25:46,200
- What can we do for you?
- Nothing, nothing at all.

1485
01:25:46,247 --> 01:25:49,125
I don't want medals or titles,

1486
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:51,397
nor a standing as a gentleman.

1487
01:25:51,447 --> 01:25:55,565
I want to remain the servant
of this audience.
