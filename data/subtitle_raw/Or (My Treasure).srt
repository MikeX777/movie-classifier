1
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,112
- Humus, fries, salad?
- Lots of fries.

2
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,156
Can I have the bottle?

3
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,356
Sure.

4
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,955
Mom!

5
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,398
I brought you a sandwich.

6
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,269
- I've been waiting for an hour.
- I brought you a sweater too.

7
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,191
Fine, give it to me.

8
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,349
- You have money for a cab?
- Yes.

9
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,149
- Why don't we take the bus?
- No, I'm too tired.

10
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,109
What's this on your face?
You're dirty.

11
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,479
I'm so tired.

12
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,958
I found ajob for you.

13
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,909
A friend's mother needs a cleaning lady.

14
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,919
Not again...
Drop it, would you!

15
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,753
Why not, Mom?
You could try.

16
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,356
- I don't want to.
- You can't go on like this.

17
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,389
- Just try it.
- Leave me alone!

18
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,152
I'm going to the restaurant.

19
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,872
Get some rest.

20
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,590
OK.

21
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,392
- You're not going out today!
- Mind your own business.

22
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,872
Where are your keys?

23
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,437
Let go of my purse! Let go of my purse!

24
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,271
Give me some salad for Or.

25
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,470
Thanks.

26
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,355
Here, eat.

27
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,875
Sa'I'd!

28
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,472
Put this aside for washing.

29
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,835
Here.

30
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,994
- Sa'I'd, the potatoes!
- They're coming.

31
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,475
Hi. How's it going?

32
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,475
- Fine. And you?
- Good.

33
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,473
How's your mother?

34
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,189
OK.

35
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,352
She came back from the hospital
a bit depressed.

36
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,830
Why?

37
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,230
Because it's depressing.

38
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,755
And now she's at home alone.

39
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,510
Then why did you come to work?

40
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,873
It's alright.
I'll see her later on.

41
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,709
If you want to go home,
I'll cover for you.

42
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,950
No.

43
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,875
Don't bother.

44
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,557
Bye.

45
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,115
Goodbye.

46
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,350
What's up? Cool.

47
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,551
How's it going?

48
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,075
- Hi, how are you?
- Fine.

49
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,957
- And you?
- Good.

50
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,316
- So...
- What?

51
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,831
I think noa is here,
she's waiting for me.

52
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,116
- Oh, yeah?
- Never mind.

53
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,315
- Go around the back...
- I know.

54
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,034
When was the telephone cut off?

55
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,519
Two days ago.

56
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,917
- Did Avi call before that?
- No.

57
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,909
He might've tried when I was out.

58
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,119
He might've tried...

59
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,236
OK.

60
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,993
This...

61
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,672
Is for your yeast infection.

62
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,309
And this, you take one now,
and one in the morning.

63
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,995
This one...
Two pills, twice a day.

64
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,189
This...

65
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,273
is your gel.

66
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,717
Viox was too expensive,
I got Optalgin instead.

67
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,799
He didn't even come to see me
at the hospital.

68
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,716
Maybe he didn't know.

69
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,591
How could he not have...

70
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,874
You think so?

71
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,790
How could he have known?

72
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,357
- Stop it, Mom!
- I don't want this.

73
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,228
Stop it... silly.

74
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:01,918
I don't want to.

75
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,037
- Why not? Mom!
- What?

76
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,118
- Come back here!
- Why?

77
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,351
- Give it a try!
- I don't want to.

78
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,956
Why not?
She's nice. Try, at least.

79
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,554
OK. But then I'm going out.

80
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,359
- Why?
- Because!

81
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,910
- Call first.
- I have to go out.

82
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,673
No, you don't have to.

83
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,717
What do I say to her?

84
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,995
You say...

85
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,956
"Hello..."

86
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,474
OK, dial.

87
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,273
- No answer.
- Wait a little.

88
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,755
Hello.

89
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,199
Yes, hello.
Yes, my name is Ruthie.

90
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,556
Yael, I'm Or's mother.

91
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,033
Yes, sure. No problem.

92
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,680
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow at four o'clock.

93
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,115
Perfect!

94
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,755
Fine, thanks.
Thank you very much. Great. Thanks.

95
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,909
Mom...

96
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,479
Fantastic!

97
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,953
How was I?

98
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,872
You were wonderful.

99
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,834
- Did I say anything dumb?
- You were great.

100
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,629
I'm going to Rachel's.
I'll bring you something to eat.

101
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,992
There weren't enough girls to play.

102
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,756
- Your team is better?
- Yes.

103
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,195
Of course!

104
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,075
They lost against Even-Yehuda.
135 to nothing.

105
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,833
I have to go.

106
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,116
Already?

107
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,476
I want to spend some time with Mom.

108
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,272
OK.

109
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,635
I'm going too.

110
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,840
- You didn't eat a thing.
- I'm on a diet...

111
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,196
I have to go too.
I have an exam.

112
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,238
- Are you going to study?
- Yes.

113
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,109
OK.

114
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,516
- Dinner was delicious.
- I'm going to the movies.

115
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,394
- And so I stay here all alone?
- Yes.

116
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,473
Rachel, may I take some food
for my mother?

117
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,831
Of course you can.

118
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,110
Mom.

119
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,470
Hello, sweetie.

120
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,310
What's going on?

121
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,237
I want to go out tonight.

122
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,474
Why?
You found ajob.

123
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,156
- Just tonight.
- No, you're not going out!

124
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,830
Hello, Ido. How are you?

125
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,549
- We brought you some food.
- Really?

126
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,875
OK.
Your mother made it?

127
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,599
- Yes.
- OK.

128
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,750
Want me to serve?

129
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,790
Just one last time,
to pay our debts. Alright?

130
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,270
Mom, that's enough.
Sit down!

131
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,353
Give yourself a chance!

132
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,912
OK, fine. Fine.

133
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,238
Is the food hot?

134
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,878
Have a seat.

135
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,149
Get me a glass of water, sweetie.

136
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,790
- How was school today?
- Fine.

137
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,468
I'll eat this...
I'll eat it tomorrow, OK?

138
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,755
Why?

139
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,078
I'm not hungry right now.

140
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,317
What's so funny?

141
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,397
I don't care about the principal.
I'm worried about my grades.

142
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,153
She won't do anything to you.

143
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,471
She can't flunk you.

144
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,713
- What happened?
- The principal caught her smoking.

145
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,949
It's too late to educate us now.

146
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,430
I'm scared about my grades.

147
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,829
Don't worry...

148
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,718
Hi, girls. How are you?

149
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,356
Gal, Judith will see you
in a few minutes. Alright?

150
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,074
Big deal for nothing.

151
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,749
I found ajob for my mother.

152
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,435
Really? Doing what?

153
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,593
- Housework.
- Excellent! Congratulations!

154
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,475
When does she start?

155
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,677
- Tomorrow, I think.
- Great!

156
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,309
OK, I hope everything goes well.

157
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,154
- We see each other...
- On Thursday.

158
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,516
- Good. Excellent news, Or.
- Bye.

159
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,868
Hava?

160
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,151
Hello.

161
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,039
Can I have some henna?
Black... 20000 grams.

162
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,317
- Four shekels' worth?
- Yes.

163
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,589
It's raining out and...

164
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,911
I'm not going out...

165
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,835
Stop moving around.

166
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,349
Stop it!

167
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,751
What'll you wear today?

168
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,874
For who?
Avi or the interview?

169
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,632
- Avi?
- Yes.

170
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,350
- He's coming over.
- So, what'll you wear?

171
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,750
- A new outfit.
- What do you mean?

172
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,798
Very chic.

173
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,755
I just bought it.
Come on, today I deserve it!

174
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,835
And I got a few T-shirts for you.

175
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,359
- Is that Avi?
- No! Avi's coming over tonight.

176
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,838
- Who is it?
- Ido.

177
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,516
- Hi.
- How are you?

178
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,117
- What's that?
- Henna.

179
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,475
What is that?

180
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,995
Hello, Ido.

181
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,875
Hello, Ruthie.

182
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,073
Come in and say hello!

183
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,390
- How are you?
- Fine.

184
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,433
- What did your mom make?
- Mafroum.

185
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,399
I love it... I love it!

186
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,029
One day I'll make your mom...

187
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,669
Some jam.
It's out of this world.

188
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,753
Have you ever tasted my mother's jam?

189
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,310
I'll make some for her one day.

190
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,392
OK, I'm going to the restaurant.

191
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,956
- Are you coming later?
- Yes.

192
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,793
Don't work too hard!

193
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,192
Mom, you're moving around.

194
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,759
What a cutie, that Ido!
He's so sweet. He loves you.

195
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,319
- He loves you.
- Stop it!

196
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,871
I'm telling you, the boy loves you!

197
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,230
Come on...

198
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,073
- Are you done?
- That's it.

199
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,072
Where's the cap?

200
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,110
Stop moving...

201
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,270
I'm so happy.

202
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,239
Hold on a second!

203
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,718
Get this thing off me!

204
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,711
How do I look like this?

205
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,075
What do you mean?

206
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,239
With the cap on...

207
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,072
Give me the laundry.

208
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,551
Did you get it everywhere?

209
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,750
Yes.

210
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,714
Even the ends.

211
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,150
Good.

212
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,429
You can't...

213
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,274
Just go like this...

214
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,955
It's raining out
and you're staying with me

215
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,836
Even if you said...

216
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,072
No, I don't have time

217
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,474
You'll earn 2,000000 shekels
with your newjob.

218
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,954
Peanuts!

219
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,395
No, it's not.

220
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,915
- How do I look?
- Perfect!

221
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,834
Nice, huh?
Look at these jeans.

222
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,831
- Am I pretty?
- Gorgeous!

223
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,755
Hello. Ruthie?
Pleased to meet you, I'm Yael. Come in.

224
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,110
Diva! Where were you?

225
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,233
Diva came to say hello.

226
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,597
Isn't that right, Diva?
Right, my pretty?

227
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,277
Diva eats over here.

228
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,309
I'll show you
how to prepare her food in the morning.

229
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,836
One and a half cups of dry dog food.

230
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,352
I said a half.
Be very careful with the "half".

231
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,037
Don't give her too much,
she has a weight problem.

232
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,996
OK. After that, you add

233
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,432
two or three spoonfuls of gravy.

234
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,117
I use the sauce
from whatever I'm cooking.

235
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,750
Got it?

236
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,631
OK, let's start over. I want to see
if you understood the portions.

237
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,035
Yes, one cup.

238
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,114
- Does the smell bother you?
- It's OK.

239
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,679
You'll get used to it.

240
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,595
- Show me. A tad less.
- I'll take some out...

241
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,072
Perfect. Like that, yes.

242
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,753
Very good.
Now you add the gravy.

243
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,200
Yes, you can put one more in.

244
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,037
Excellent!
Yes, that's good.

245
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,989
Diva! Come here, my lovely.
Your food is ready.

246
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,117
Good.

247
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,632
Tell me about yourself.

248
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,870
What?

249
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,518
I understand you've never
done cleaning before?

250
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,159
I've done a little.

251
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,156
It's not very complicated.
We'll work things out.

252
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,430
- I'm going to play soccer.
- Bye.

253
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,436
- Hi.
- How are you?

254
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,957
- What's new?
- Nothing.

255
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,873
Anyone got a cigarette?

256
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,029
Here you go.

257
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,110
Thanks.

258
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,113
Want to come up to my place?

259
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,911
No, forget it.

260
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,590
Mom.

261
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,672
He didn't come?

262
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,070
What's it look like?

263
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,315
He can forget about me, that dog.

264
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,116
How did the interview go?

265
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,989
You want to sleep in the bedroom?

266
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,469
No, sweetie.

267
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,916
- Good night.
- Good night, sweetie.

268
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,639
Hold me tight.

269
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,433
- Georgetta...
- OK...

270
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,200
Georgetta... OK...

271
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,110
Get out of here.

272
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,715
Where are you, Georgetta?

273
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,551
Be gentle... Alright?

274
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,755
Or.

275
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,835
Or.

276
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,993
- Or.
- What?

277
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,438
Are you up?

278
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,114
So, how did it go?

279
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,075
What's wrong?

280
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,157
- Why are you sitting down?
- I'm too tired to clean.

281
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,076
Stop it, Mom. Get up.
It's all going to work out.

282
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,348
Hi, Ido.

283
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,633
- How are you?
- Fine.

284
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,792
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

285
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,509
Let's go.

286
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,229
OK, I'm off.

287
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,789
- You're not coming to school?
- Later.

288
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,873
You need some help?

289
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,513
No, that's OK.

290
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,709
Bye.

291
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,753
Ruthie, hello.

292
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,477
Shmuel?
I didn't see you. How are you?

293
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,270
Fine. Say...
Do you have my money?

294
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,876
I've got some, here.

295
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,397
- What's this?
- It's what I've got.

296
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,673
Next month's rent is coming up soon.

297
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,349
And?

298
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,552
- What do you say?
- About what?

299
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,830
- Let's have some fun, like we used to.
- No, no.

300
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,789
Leave me alone.

301
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,031
You know how good I can make you...

302
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,315
Hello.

303
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,159
Come on, leave me alone.

304
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,508
You're not interested?

305
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,319
No, I'm not.

306
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,958
Too bad for you.

307
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,909
Who is it?

308
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,150
Moshiko.

309
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,871
What's going on?

310
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,758
- Who is it?
- Moshiko.

311
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,475
Moshiko! Hi, honey!

312
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,273
Shit. I don't have the key.
One second, I'm looking for a key.

313
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,717
How are you, honey?

314
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,314
- Hi.
- Took you long enough.

315
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,915
Sorry, sweetheart. How are you?

316
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,800
- Fine.
- I couldn't find the key.

317
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,157
Come on in.

318
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,359
Sit down, I'm coming.

319
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,550
Mom.

320
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,470
Sweetie, give me 100 minutes.
Go for a walk, OK?

321
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,230
Mom!

322
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,239
Who's with you?

323
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,389
Open the door!

324
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,230
Mom!

325
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,109
What's he doing here?

326
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,274
How did you get in?

327
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,950
- Get out, Or.
- No, he's leaving.

328
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,750
Get out, Moshiko.

329
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,751
OK, OK.

330
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,149
Go to your bedroom.

331
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,198
Let me get my shoes on...

332
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,157
I'm sorry, Moshiko.

333
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,517
Go to your room.

334
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,673
Get out!

335
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,678
- Bye.
- OK, OK.

336
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,678
Don't look at me like that!

337
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,633
Get out of my face,
I don't want to see you!

338
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,310
- I thought you stopped.
- You thought I stopped...

339
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,758
How can I?
You think you can just up and stop?

340
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,516
- Just like that?
- That's what you always say.

341
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,354
At least I know him.
Is the street better?

342
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,557
You know the entire street too!

343
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,437
Leave me alone...
Leave me alone now.

344
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,477
You don't understand.
What do you know?

345
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,391
What?

346
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,598
Yes, what do you know?

347
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,115
You promised me!

348
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,709
How could I promise you?

349
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,118
How could I promise?
What did I promise you?

350
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,669
You can go back to the street.

351
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,317
- Isn't it a little late for cleaning?
- No.

352
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,110
You shouldn't work so hard.

353
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,829
I don't want to preach,
but at your age,

354
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,789
I knew that work
was very important.

355
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,994
But that schooling
was even more important.

356
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,515
You have to think of your future.

357
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,035
Even today, I still...

358
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,239
I'm not ashamed to admit it...
Even on TV, I watch

359
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,439
national Geographic.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

360
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,752
Stop it, Shmuel.
Leave me alone, go to bed.

361
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,713
- How are you?
- Fine.

362
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,314
How's it going?

363
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,552
- Fine. And you?
- Good.

364
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,519
Got a cigarette?

365
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,790
Yes.

366
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,715
I'm coming.

367
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,759
Want to have a smoke?

368
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,190
Mom.

369
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,195
Get up.

370
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,389
Mom, get up.
You'll be late.

371
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,117
I'm not going today.

372
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,555
Yes, you are.

373
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,793
I'm tired.

374
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,750
Mom.

375
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,550
Get up.

376
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,832
You'll be late.

377
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,669
Come on, get up.

378
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,069
OK...

379
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,354
OK, OK...

380
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,710
You think I should call her?

381
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,870
Orjust hurry up and go?

382
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,633
Just go.

383
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,629
- OK?
- Fine.

384
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,188
- Are you going?
- Yes.

385
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,509
You promise?

386
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,670
Yes. What's with you this morning?
Why are you all...

387
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,789
- What are you so happy about?
- Bye.

388
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,149
Ruthie!

389
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,956
Hi, how are you?

390
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,310
Avi...

391
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,953
- You going out?
- What are you doing here?

392
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,875
I brought you some croissants.

393
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,872
So... you want to come up?

394
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,559
Aren't you going somewhere?

395
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,555
It can wait a while...

396
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,629
Don't bother with that.

397
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,389
Come on.

398
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,276
I'll bring some hooks over.

399
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,794
OK.

400
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,878
You brought me croissants.

401
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,036
I have something to tell you.

402
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,112
- Something good?
- Yes.

403
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,677
I found ajob.

404
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,234
- Really?
- Yes.

405
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,676
Cleaning.

406
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,236
Or found it for me.
With a lady named Yael.

407
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,030
She's a nice lady.

408
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,110
Yes.

409
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:25,155
- Really? Or like usual?
- No, really. Really...

410
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,474
Do you believe me?

411
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,718
Sure, why not?

412
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,836
I want to stop...
All the rest.

413
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,512
Stop my work.

414
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,350
- Well?
- I'm glad.

415
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,069
- I'm glad. Real happy...
- no...

416
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,355
Really?

417
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,554
- You're in love.
- Knock it off.

418
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,235
Who is it?

419
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,549
Rachel.

420
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,074
- Rachel!
- Hi.

421
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,038
Come on in.

422
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,315
Thanks.

423
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,911
It's been ages.

424
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,676
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you...

425
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,594
- Some juice?
- No, I want to talk to you.

426
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:21,870
- Oh?
- Yes.

427
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,955
- Sit down.
- How long have we been neighbors?

428
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,433
I don't know. I moved in here...

429
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,790
When Or was 2 years old, right?

430
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,633
- Yes.
- A long time ago.

431
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:39,553
I'll be frank with you.
I've always been straightforward, right?

432
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,437
Yes.

433
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,878
OK, listen.
Or and Ido spent the night together.

434
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,031
I know.
They're so cute...

435
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,069
Real lovebirds.
This morning they left together...

436
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,594
Yes... But...

437
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,352
I'm not comfortable with it.

438
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,077
You see?
I'm not comfortable with it.

439
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,553
- I...
- What?

440
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,029
They don't fit together.
It's not right.

441
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,355
Or is a lovely girl.

442
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,069
- Did I say the contrary?
- And so?

443
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,313
And so, it's just not right.
What more can I say?

444
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,909
But, he...

445
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,793
Ido loves her.

446
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,998
'Ido lovs hr"?

447
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,151
Yes. He loves her.

448
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,595
He comes here and picks her up.

449
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,639
He calls her,
they go to school together,

450
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,190
he walks her to work...

451
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,636
He's with her all day long.

452
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,235
They spend every minute together.

453
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:46,596
But he's not the only one.

454
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:50,117
Everyone else loves her
and she loves them.

455
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,670
Guys traipsing up and down...

456
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,228
Do you understand?

457
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,515
Hi.

458
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,310
Is something wrong?

459
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,709
No.

460
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,511
- Well?
- We were just talking.

461
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,872
About what?

462
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,913
We were talking... about you and Ido.

463
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,073
What about us?

464
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,191
Or... come here.

465
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,996
Look, I know that you and Ido...

466
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,837
Spent the night together.
Isn't that true?

467
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,429
Isn't it true?

468
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,513
Tell me...

469
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,151
now listen.
I don't think it's right.

470
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,154
Why not?

471
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,156
Because...

472
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,432
Because you're older than him. Right?

473
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,029
- Six months. Does that count?
- Yes.

474
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,992
At your age, it counts.

475
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,029
Why?

476
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,355
Why?

477
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,236
Mom?

478
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,708
What, sweetie?

479
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,952
I don't know...
Maybe Rachel is right.

480
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,719
What do you mean "right"?

481
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,518
Lt'd be a shame...
to ruin our friendship.

482
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,631
- Why would it be ruined?
- Or.

483
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,034
Nothing will change.
You can still come over for dinner...

484
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,995
You can continue working for Ha'I'm.

485
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,431
There's no problem.
You know I care about you?

486
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,075
Alright?

487
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,715
- I'm going now, Ruthie, OK?
- Yes.

488
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,035
Don't you dare start crying on me.

489
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,476
Sweetie. Honey.

490
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:40,798
- Dad, get their bill.
- See if they need anything else.

491
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,837
- Sa'I'd, I need the big pot.
- It's coming.

492
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,315
Eat.

493
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,039
Is everything OK?

494
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:06,795
Yes.

495
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,916
Ido, clear the table over there.

496
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,791
Are you sure you're alright?

497
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,314
- Dad.
- What?

498
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,160
Give me the bill.
They're done over there.

499
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:18,670
Dad.

500
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,589
I'm leaving.

501
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,516
Or, I'm going now.

502
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,877
- Bye, Sa'I'd.
- Bye.

503
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,515
- You coming over later?
- Of course.

504
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,869
You sure?

505
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,238
I'll come over after soccer.

506
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,556
- OK?
- OK.

507
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,190
Bye.

508
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,388
How's it going?

509
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,796
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on leave.

510
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,674
Really? How's the army?

511
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,838
"How's the army?"
Come on, let me in.

512
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:43,790
I was on my way out, so...

513
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,514
What's going on?
I just got here.

514
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,111
- I have to go...
- Go where?

515
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,154
- I have to go...
- When was the last time I saw you?

516
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,158
- It's been a while.
- That's right.

517
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:58,393
- Then why are you running off?
- I can't.

518
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,076
I can't right now.

519
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,713
I don't want to.

520
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,673
- You know I like being with you.
- Yes...

521
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,315
Yes?

522
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,559
But I don't want to.

523
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,751
- Yes you do.
- Leave me alone.

524
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:14,995
No.

525
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,148
Yes.

526
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,869
You see?

527
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,832
- No, leave me alone...
- Come on.

528
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,195
Come on, let's go to your room.

529
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,909
You coming?

530
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,279
I have to go now, OK?

531
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,792
I'll see you later?

532
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:51,753
- Maybe.
- OK, bye.

533
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,075
Mom?

534
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:27,111
- What happened?
- Don't come in.

535
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,788
Are you alright?

536
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,839
Does it hurt?

537
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,749
A little.

538
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,757
Do you need anything?

539
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,795
No, I just want to take a bath.

540
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:04,635
It's OK...

541
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,199
That's enough. Turn it off.

542
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,355
Mom.

543
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,757
You're never going out again.

544
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,509
Look at me.
You're not going out again.

545
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,548
Don't worry.

546
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,678
You can count on me.

547
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,917
Everything will be OK.

548
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,314
Don't... Don't...

549
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,474
Don't...

550
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,314
It'll be OK.
You can count on me.

551
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,389
It's OK.

552
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,590
- You want the light off?
- Yes, sweetie.

553
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,916
Tomorrow you'll stay home and rest.

554
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,233
What about Yael?

555
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,796
We'll find something else.

556
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,672
- Really?
- Yes.

557
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,231
You're my little treasure.

558
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:10,150
No one has a treasure like I do.

559
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,796
You're my sunshine.

560
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:20,835
Good night.

561
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,353
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

562
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,471
- Did you bring the rent money?
- No.

563
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,559
Can I come in?

564
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,559
You're so beautiful...

565
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:35,151
So I'm sitting there on his couch...

566
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,673
He's so excited he doesn't know
what to do with himself...

567
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,476
And I take off my T-shirt.

568
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,349
I don't have to lift a finger...
He just jerks off.

569
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:53,638
All I do is make noises likel
'Oh... Y s... Com on."

570
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,793
- Gross.
- Why? I couldn't care less.

571
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,833
He was so excited
he came right away.

572
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,678
Cool, huh?

573
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:16,835
You coming?

574
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,191
I think I'll go home.

575
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,114
Yes?

576
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,112
- Hello.
- Or, sit down.

577
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:30,389
No, I...

578
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:34,117
I'm going.
Everything's fine

579
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,038
I just have a headache.

580
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,756
Then sit down. Drink something.

581
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,189
No.

582
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,150
- Are you sure you're OK?
- Yes...

583
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,396
You don't want to talk?

584
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:48,399
No. Everything's fine, I'm fine.

585
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:52,559
- How is your mother's job going?
- Fine.

586
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,678
What if we talked on Monday?

587
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,791
Anat, I need to see you.

588
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,718
- Just a minute...
- It's OK, go on.

589
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,195
- We'll talk soon, Or.
- Sure.

590
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:06,630
Hi.

591
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,592
What's going on?

592
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:10,871
Is something wrong?
Wait.

593
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:13,037
- What?
- Where were you yesterday?

594
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,389
When?

595
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,519
When we were supposed to meet up.

596
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,037
I forgot, I had something to do...

597
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:22,833
What's wrong?

598
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:24,189
Nothing!

599
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,713
- We'll talk about it later, OK?
- No... Wait.

600
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,312
Ido, look, this isn't working out.

601
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,114
No, leave me alone.
It's just not right.

602
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:36,396
- Wait a second.
- What?

603
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,992
- Where are you going?
- Stop it. I don't love you.

604
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,712
How are you, honey?

605
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:19,229
What did the doctor say?

606
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,159
My wife will take care of you. Iris.

607
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,158
Hang on,
I have nathalie on the phone.

608
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,953
I'll be right with you...

609
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:30,678
Perfect. The girls say hi.

610
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:34,790
Yes. I'll put you back
on the schedule next week.

611
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:39,518
Don't worry.
Get better, I'll pay your expenses.

612
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:44,238
OK, rest up. Bye.

613
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,719
Honey!
Sacha called. It's urgent.

614
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,110
OK.

615
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,230
- What's your name?
- Or.

616
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,353
- I'm Iris. How are you?
- Fine.

617
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:58,393
You'll need a pseudonym.
You have one?

618
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:03,309
Something Israeli...

619
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:08,431
Sivan?

620
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,954
I'll start from the beginning.
We run an escort service.

621
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:18,594
Clients call. We send them
the girls they ask for.

622
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:21,189
How are you, honey?
How'd it go?

623
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,436
- Like usual.
- Perfect.

624
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:30,319
We take 1500 shekels.
That's for the escort service only.

625
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:34,275
After that it's your business.
You understand?

626
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,959
How much?

627
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,468
Girls!

628
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,070
Be quiet two minutes, OK?

629
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,118
The girls get 20000 for 2 hours.

630
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,073
You negotiate with the client
over the phone

631
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:50,033
before you leave here. OK?

632
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:54,679
You must leave from here
and come back here.

633
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,037
OK? It's very important.

634
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,753
What did Sacha want?

635
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,315
I don't know, love. Call him.

636
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:04,590
The drivers who work with us

637
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,792
take you to the hotel
or the apartment...

638
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:11,277
You only tell the cab to go
if everything's OK.

639
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:14,199
If you don't like something,
you come back.

640
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,914
But you should try and avoid that.

641
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,595
One second.

642
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,792
Sexclusive, good day.

643
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,878
Shlomo? How are you, darling?

644
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,589
Svetlana isn't working today.

645
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,672
Shlomo... I've got something new...

646
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,958
that you won't believe.

647
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,869
- Hello.
- Hello. Come in.

648
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:58,270
- Sivan, are you OK in there?
- Yes.

649
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,836
What's with the towel?
Relax, like me.

650
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,194
That's better.

651
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,313
- How old are you?
- 18.

652
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,749
18!

653
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,111
I like 18.

654
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,072
I adore 18...

655
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,838
What a beautiful ass!

656
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:28,073
You know what?

657
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,352
I want to fuck you in the ass.
What do you say?

658
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,150
It makes you laugh, does it?

659
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,274
I like that.

660
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,276
So?

661
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:40,074
We didn't discuss it on the phone.

662
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,835
I didn't know
I'd be getting such a nice ass.

663
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:47,354
Don't worry. I've got Vaseline
and everything else we need.

664
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,228
OK? Alright?

665
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,509
OK.

666
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,920
Wow... What an ass.

667
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,957
Wonderful.
Just what I need.

668
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:35,038
You look hot tonight.

669
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,158
- How's it going?
- Great!

670
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,271
- Want some cigarettes?
- Yes.

671
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:55,789
What's new?

672
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,828
The usual...

673
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:03,390
See ya.

674
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:17,835
Mom?

675
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,716
Hello.

676
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,149
Hi, sweetie.

677
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,399
How are you?

678
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:31,954
Fine.

679
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:55,275
Sweetie.

680
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:00,229
You look pretty like that
with a dress on.

681
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:07,193
What about my shoes?

682
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:09,639
Are they new?

683
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,434
They're nice. Very nice.

684
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:40,432
Don't cry, my love.
I'll be OK.

685
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:43,992
I'll see you tomorrow?

686
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:46,908
Bye, sweetie.

687
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,149
Mom!

688
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,353
Don't go.

689
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,352
I don't want you to go!

690
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:22,433
Let go of me... Let go, sweetie.

691
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,069
No.

692
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,635
Sweetie... Come on, let go...

693
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,114
I'll be back in the morning, OK?

694
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,116
No...

695
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:53,756
I'll see you tomorrow morning, sweetie.

696
01:28:54,280 --> 01:28:55,315
No.

697
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,038
I'll see you tomorrow.

698
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:03,955
Let go of me.

699
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:03,395
Iris?

700
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:05,998
Hello, it's Or.

701
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,589
Hi.

702
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:12,078
Do you have anything?

703
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,438
Then I can come?

704
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:20,389
OK.

705
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:21,635
Cool.

706
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,395
It's this way... Come on, girls.

707
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,075
A lesbian act!

708
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:17,036
Down here is just for kicks.

709
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,754
The real action takes place upstairs.

710
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:21,712
Come on, come on.

711
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:30,874
After the striptease,
once things get going,

712
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,157
you bring the groom up here.

713
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:36,398
- He sleeps with one of you... or both.
- No problem.

714
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:38,113
OK, perfect.

715
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,517
Some of the guys
are gonna be real horny...

716
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:44,030
Is what we arranged
on the phone OK?

717
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,833
1,000000 each?

718
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:48,111
Cool. I'm going back down.

719
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,470
Everyone has a good time. OK?

720
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:52,079
We'll be waiting downstairs.

721
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:54,669
- Where's the restroom?
- Here.

722
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:57,076
