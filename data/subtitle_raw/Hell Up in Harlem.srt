1
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:53,751
Mr. Diangelo,
I gotta talk to you. It's important.

2
00:00:54,252 --> 00:00:55,886
Hey, call the DA's office.

3
00:00:55,887 --> 00:00:57,888
It's about Tommy Gibbs.

4
00:00:57,889 --> 00:00:59,756
Let the young lady alone.

5
00:00:59,757 --> 00:01:02,759
What about Tommy Gibbs?

6
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,261
It's all set up.

7
00:01:04,262 --> 00:01:06,763
On 57th street
and 5th Avenue, they're gonna kill him.

8
00:01:06,764 --> 00:01:09,266
Why tell me?

9
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:10,768
Why don't you warn
Gibbs personally?

10
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:13,271
I'm a part of it. I can't.

11
00:01:13,404 --> 00:01:14,905
You mean you had
a change of heart?

12
00:01:14,906 --> 00:01:16,907
They threatened to kill my kids!

13
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:17,909
Who?

14
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:19,025
You won't believe me,

15
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:22,028
but some of your police.

16
00:01:22,029 --> 00:01:25,031
So the police are going
to kill Tommy Gibbs in cold blood

17
00:01:25,032 --> 00:01:27,033
and you want me to stop it?

18
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:30,921
What should I do? Arrest
the entire New York City police department?

19
00:01:30,922 --> 00:01:35,926
There are ledgers
with names of corrupt city officials.

20
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:40,431
Tommy thinks
they're still in his safe deposit box.

21
00:01:40,932 --> 00:01:42,433
I made a wax
impression of the key,

22
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:45,936
and I gave it to those pigs.

23
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:48,939
They have the ledgers now!

24
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,692
That's the only hold
Tommy had over them.

25
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:54,194
Get in the car, please.

26
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:15,966
You black bitches
are all alike. You're stupid!

27
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:18,969
Gibbs is as good as dead
already. It's done.

28
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,472
Some very important people
have taken care of that.

29
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,841
Please don't kill Tommy!

30
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:28,345
Kill me!
Do anything, but don't kill Tommy, please!

31
00:02:28,346 --> 00:02:29,846
Irish...

32
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:32,349
Irish, don't you think
it's about time?

33
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,352
Drop me a block from Tiffany's.

34
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:44,995
Please kill me.

35
00:02:44,996 --> 00:02:46,497
No!

36
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:09,696
Up on the sidewalk! Here's $500!

37
00:04:09,697 --> 00:04:13,951
Get up on that sidewalk!

38
00:04:43,364 --> 00:04:45,982
He's not going anywhere.
He's caught in traffic ahead.

39
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:50,370
He'll never make it to Broadway.

40
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:56,493
Run that light!

41
00:04:56,494 --> 00:04:58,495
Run that light!

42
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:00,130
Step on it, man! Step on it!

43
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:05,886
Jesus Christ, man,
they got guns!

44
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:24,154
Don't stop! Don't stop!

45
00:05:24,155 --> 00:05:28,776
He's gonna shoot!

46
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:04,345
We hit him, but he got away.

47
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:06,946
He's bleeding like a pig.
He's somewhere in the city now.

48
00:06:06,947 --> 00:06:09,949
You need a Cannon
to kill those niggers, for crying out loud.

49
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,068
<i>Well, we have nothing to worry about</i>

50
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:13,570
<i>as long as we still
have the ledgers.</i>

51
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:25,832
Hello?

52
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,334
It's Tommy.

53
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:31,337
I'm hurt. I need your help.

54
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:32,839
You turned your back
on me when I was a kid.

55
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,842
Don't do it to me again.

56
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:38,344
Meet me where we used to live.

57
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:39,346
All right.

58
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:21,771
Son, I came when you called me.

59
00:07:21,772 --> 00:07:24,274
I'm here to help you.

60
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:26,276
God, what did they do to you?

61
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:28,279
Get me off the street.
They're looking for me.

62
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:32,782
God, I've never seen
a man shot before.

63
00:07:32,783 --> 00:07:35,034
I didn't expect my son
to be like this.

64
00:07:35,035 --> 00:07:36,035
Come on, let me give you a hand.

65
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:42,659
All right? I'll get you
to your friends safely.

66
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,162
Cops...
They're trying to kill me.

67
00:07:45,412 --> 00:07:47,413
Just put one foot
in front of you...

68
00:07:47,414 --> 00:07:48,915
And just put your weight on me.

69
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,417
We'll go to the park
and rest. You remember?

70
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:53,052
Where you used to play as a kid.

71
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,561
You're hurt bad.

72
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:02,562
We'll have to get you
to a hospital.

73
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:05,565
But they'll have them
all covered, pa.

74
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:07,568
Sit down here, son.
That's right.

75
00:08:08,068 --> 00:08:09,819
Gotta take over a hospital, pa.

76
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,072
Gotta hide the ledgers
where nobody'll find them.

77
00:08:13,073 --> 00:08:14,824
I can hide them
right here in the park.

78
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:17,327
Where I used to take you
when you was a small boy.

79
00:08:17,328 --> 00:08:18,828
That hiding place, remember?

80
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:21,331
That secret place we had?

81
00:08:21,332 --> 00:08:22,333
Ok.

82
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,383
I got you. Sit down.

83
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:15,885
Here...

84
00:09:15,886 --> 00:09:20,390
There's... a number
on that piece of paper.

85
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:23,893
It's the number of
some brothers that still may help me.

86
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:25,896
Get 'em over here.

87
00:10:09,306 --> 00:10:12,308
You got... you got a half hour
before you make that call.

88
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:15,812
Make sure, pa,
you get through to Diangelo personally!

89
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:17,815
Mention the word "ledgers."

90
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,533
Sorry to break in
on you like this, but...

91
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:47,537
We didn't figure
you'd make us a house call.

92
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:53,042
All right...
Get started, will ya?

93
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:55,045
Don't put me to sleep, doc.

94
00:12:27,077 --> 00:12:29,078
God damn!

95
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:32,082
You some kind of horse doctor?

96
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:00,477
I said no calls.

97
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:03,479
But he says it's
about some ledgers.

98
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,982
Wait outside.

99
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:11,120
Put him on and
have the call traced.

100
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:13,239
This is Mr. Diangelo speaking.

101
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,626
Mr. Diangelo?
We have the ledgers.

102
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:20,631
Unless Tommy Gibbs
is given safe conduct from the hospital,

103
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:24,134
copies will be sent
to your superiors.

104
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:26,502
I don't believe you.
Who is this?

105
00:13:26,503 --> 00:13:30,506
Xerox is a very
useful weapon, Mr. Diangelo.

106
00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:31,757
Don't hang up!

107
00:13:31,758 --> 00:13:35,261
Bye.

108
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:37,764
Get me the captain
in charge of Harlem hospital.

109
00:13:38,265 --> 00:13:39,265
Gibbs?

110
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:42,268
Gibbs! We got our orders.

111
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:43,769
We're gonna give you
an ambulance,

112
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,271
and nobody's gonna follow you.

113
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:48,274
We're gonna
guarantee your safety.

114
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:49,775
Are you listening to me, Gibbs?

115
00:13:49,776 --> 00:13:52,778
Now, release the hostages!

116
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:58,785
Well, answer me!

117
00:13:59,286 --> 00:14:01,287
Look, Diangelo, I talked to him.

118
00:14:01,288 --> 00:14:02,788
He won't even give me an answer.

119
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:04,790
I know I got my orders,
but I'm not about...

120
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,792
You listen to me.
These are my men here.

121
00:14:06,793 --> 00:14:08,294
I'm not gonna have them
put in a meat chopper.

122
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:09,929
Those are your orders, captain!

123
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,934
Yeah.

124
00:14:14,434 --> 00:14:17,436
If those bastards in there
so much as twitch

125
00:14:17,437 --> 00:14:19,939
or squeeze off one round,
you nail them!

126
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:44,080
Johnny...

127
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:46,583
T-tell the boys
not to shoot first.

128
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:57,476
Don't shoot first...
Whatever you do.

129
00:14:57,477 --> 00:14:58,978
Stay cool.

130
00:15:08,855 --> 00:15:10,856
Hold your fire, Zach!

131
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:13,359
We got a deal with them!
Hold your fire!

132
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,862
Got a deal going
with the cops. Don't screw it up.

133
00:15:22,502 --> 00:15:27,006
Doc... I hope that ambulance...

134
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:29,009
Is in the back
for your sake, doc!

135
00:15:46,026 --> 00:15:47,526
Everybody stand back.

136
00:15:47,527 --> 00:15:49,145
Don't interfere
with those men at all.

137
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:52,649
Stand back. The men are dangerous.
Stay out of their way.

138
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,284
Keep those people back.
Everyone, stay back.

139
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:58,904
Keep those people back
over there!

140
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:01,040
All you officers stand back.

141
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:04,044
They have safe conduct
from the district attorney.

142
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:46,035
Where are you guys taking me?

143
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:48,037
What... what are you doing here?

144
00:16:48,038 --> 00:16:50,039
I don't know what
you people want with me.

145
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,542
I haven't done anything wrong.

146
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:55,044
Mr. Gibbs.

147
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:56,545
Yes, sir.

148
00:16:56,546 --> 00:16:59,298
My name is Diangelo,
district attorney for this county.

149
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:01,300
Your son had in his possession

150
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:04,804
books with the names
of very important people in this city,

151
00:17:05,305 --> 00:17:07,306
and if they get
in the wrong hands,

152
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:09,808
it's going to cause
a lot of trouble for a lot of people.

153
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:11,810
I don't know anything
about any books.

154
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:14,313
Mr. Gibbs, is it because
you don't trust me?

155
00:17:14,314 --> 00:17:15,314
No, sir. That's not it.

156
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:17,950
Please try to think, Mr. Gibbs.

157
00:17:17,951 --> 00:17:20,452
In truth, sir,
I don't know anything about any books.

158
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:22,204
I'm trying to help you.

159
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:25,207
I understand that, sir,
but I don't know what you're talking about.

160
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:28,210
I'm sorry, Mr. Gibbs.

161
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:35,084
Can I go home now, sir?

162
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:37,586
Look, I don't know
anything about any books.

163
00:17:37,587 --> 00:17:43,592
I didn't do anything.

164
00:17:43,593 --> 00:17:46,595
No!

165
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:52,234
It's the truth!
I didn't do nothin'!

166
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:07,866
Motherfuckers!

167
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:10,619
Dirty damn...

168
00:18:36,646 --> 00:18:39,148
I saw those guys
pick you up on the street,

169
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:42,652
so I thought I'd follow you.

170
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:45,155
Tommy gonna be proud of you.

171
00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:46,906
Took care of 2 of 'em.

172
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:56,549
Welcome to the club, pa.

173
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,552
I killed 'em.

174
00:19:00,053 --> 00:19:03,056
I had to.

175
00:19:03,556 --> 00:19:05,557
It all happened so quick.

176
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:08,560
You done well.
It must run in the family.

177
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:13,565
I've never hit anyone like
that since I was a child.

178
00:19:13,566 --> 00:19:16,568
They went down so easy.

179
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:23,576
Got their blood all over me.

180
00:19:23,693 --> 00:19:26,328
We're both
wanted killers now, pa.

181
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:27,329
Father and son.

182
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,833
But we'll be back on top
soon, running things.

183
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:33,585
'Cause I got the goods
on everybody.

184
00:19:33,586 --> 00:19:35,587
You know,

185
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:38,841
I'm gonna take you
in the business, pa, as a partner.

186
00:19:38,842 --> 00:19:44,096
That's right. A partner.

187
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:47,099
Yes, sure. I appreciate it.

188
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,601
You're gonna have to earn it.

189
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:51,603
You got a lot
of work to do while I lie low.

190
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:54,356
I'll be close by
when you need me.

191
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:57,860
But first...
We gotta pay off everybody

192
00:19:57,861 --> 00:20:00,863
that was involved
in that action outside of Tiffany's.

193
00:20:00,864 --> 00:20:02,364
And we gotta do it quick.

194
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:07,369
Before they realize
your son is back in operation.

195
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,371
Well...

196
00:20:09,372 --> 00:20:15,878
You just give me
the names and places of everybody.

197
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:19,882
If mama could just
see us now... together.

198
00:20:19,883 --> 00:20:23,635
She'd be happy.

199
00:20:23,636 --> 00:20:26,638
<i>I got something planned for Helen.</i>

200
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:31,143
She was working with those pigs
like Diangelo to steal the ledgers

201
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:34,646
so she's got
to pay for that, pa, you understand?

202
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:39,535
So you find her and you
take away the only thing she really loves.

203
00:20:39,536 --> 00:20:41,904
We've never met.

204
00:20:41,905 --> 00:20:43,539
I'm Tommy's father.

205
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:55,167
Put them in the car.

206
00:20:55,168 --> 00:20:57,803
You ain't fit to raise children.

207
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:02,174
I said, put them in the car!

208
00:21:02,175 --> 00:21:07,179
Wait! What are you
going to do with them?

209
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,182
Bring them up
like they were my own.

210
00:21:10,183 --> 00:21:12,684
You've got no love for them.

211
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:16,321
You're just doing this
to hurt me, to get even.

212
00:21:16,322 --> 00:21:19,575
I got love for them,

213
00:21:19,576 --> 00:21:22,077
and I'm gonna
try to keep them from ever knowing

214
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:25,080
what their mother
did to their father.

215
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:28,450
Wait...
Let me kiss them good-bye?

216
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:30,953
Please?

217
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:32,455
All right. Go ahead.

218
00:22:31,147 --> 00:22:32,648
Good evening, Mr. Diangelo.

219
00:22:33,516 --> 00:22:34,517
Good to see you again.

220
00:22:49,532 --> 00:22:51,417
Diangelo!

221
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:01,426
Pa, what's the matter?

222
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:03,428
I just had a bad dream.

223
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:05,430
I dreamt I... I dreamt
that I killed Diangelo.

224
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:06,932
Diangelo?

225
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:08,633
In front of a crowd of people.

226
00:23:08,935 --> 00:23:10,936
In front of the opera.

227
00:23:10,937 --> 00:23:12,939
What's wrong with the old man?

228
00:23:13,439 --> 00:23:18,944
Sick...
Or did he piss in the bed?

229
00:23:18,945 --> 00:23:20,445
You shut your mouth.

230
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:21,947
You talk when
I tell you to talk!

231
00:23:21,948 --> 00:23:23,949
Now, you apologize to my pa!

232
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,450
It's all right, son.
It's all right.

233
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:27,953
No, it's not all right.

234
00:23:27,954 --> 00:23:29,955
You show my pa some respect.

235
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:35,460
You apologize, now!

236
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:36,962
I'm sorry.

237
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:38,463
I don't wanna read your lips.

238
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:39,965
I wanna hear you!

239
00:23:39,966 --> 00:23:41,467
Say it!

240
00:23:41,968 --> 00:23:45,470
Sorry... if that makes you
feel any better.

241
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:46,972
Your ambition's gonna get you

242
00:23:46,973 --> 00:23:50,475
in a lot of trouble, Zach.

243
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:51,476
Now, you get out.

244
00:23:51,477 --> 00:23:52,978
Take care of that wound.

245
00:23:52,979 --> 00:23:54,981
I'll take care of it, Zach.

246
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:04,990
Lay down, pa. Get some rest.

247
00:24:04,991 --> 00:24:06,491
Ok, son.

248
00:24:06,492 --> 00:24:09,995
We'll take care
of Diangelo in due time.

249
00:24:09,996 --> 00:24:11,496
Matter of fact,

250
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:12,998
I'm gonna give you
a lot of practice tomorrow.

251
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:13,999
I want you
to take care of that informer

252
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,001
who fingered me
in front of Tiffany's.

253
00:24:16,002 --> 00:24:19,004
<i>They got over 200 kilos of heroin</i>

254
00:24:19,005 --> 00:24:20,005
coming in from Singapore,

255
00:24:20,006 --> 00:24:21,506
shipped out of Tokyo.

256
00:24:21,507 --> 00:24:25,510
Now, we'll shut down
their Japanese connection.

257
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:27,012
Now, I know you can handle

258
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:29,515
some of them little
Japanese guys, right, pa?

259
00:24:31,017 --> 00:24:35,137
Now, we'll pull our own
little Pearl harbor on them, right?

260
00:24:35,138 --> 00:24:36,638
We'll put the syndicate
out of business,

261
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:39,141
dry up their sources of revenue.

262
00:24:39,142 --> 00:24:41,893
Then they got no money
for payoffs,

263
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:44,396
and Diangelo comes to us.

264
00:25:57,103 --> 00:25:59,104
<i>Now, you watch the store for me, pa.</i>

265
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:01,106
I got some island-hopping to do.

266
00:26:01,107 --> 00:26:02,607
I'll bring you back a souvenir?

267
00:26:02,608 --> 00:26:04,109
The heads of the crime syndicate

268
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,228
as our prisoners of war.

269
00:26:06,729 --> 00:26:10,732
Then we sort of
exchange pows, right?

270
00:26:10,733 --> 00:26:13,235
I mean, they give us
our freedom,

271
00:26:13,236 --> 00:26:14,736
clear us of all charges,

272
00:26:14,737 --> 00:26:18,624
and we let the big bosses
live a little bit longer.

273
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:02,167
Who made up all that bullshit

274
00:27:02,168 --> 00:27:03,768
that black people
don't know how to swim?

275
00:29:12,548 --> 00:29:15,417
How do you like
the hired help, palermo?

276
00:29:15,418 --> 00:29:17,919
They'll clean up
the mess they made, won't you, ladies?

277
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,804
Now, see, that just goes
to show you,

278
00:29:19,805 --> 00:29:23,558
you never know who's
doing up your socks and underwear.

279
00:29:29,932 --> 00:29:31,933
No more killing.

280
00:29:31,934 --> 00:29:33,935
We'll negotiate.

281
00:29:33,936 --> 00:29:36,071
We'll work this out.

282
00:29:36,072 --> 00:29:37,572
How can I?

283
00:29:37,573 --> 00:29:40,075
I'm a wanted man, me and my pa.

284
00:29:40,076 --> 00:29:41,576
That could be fixed up.

285
00:29:41,577 --> 00:29:43,828
We got judges,
prosecutors, on our payroll.

286
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:46,081
The ladies here
cooked something in the kitchen.

287
00:29:46,082 --> 00:29:47,832
Go bring it in, ladies.

288
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,834
Now, you gentlemen
are gonna be my guests

289
00:29:49,835 --> 00:29:52,337
till after my acquittal.

290
00:29:52,338 --> 00:29:55,341
Sorta like my, security.

291
00:30:01,714 --> 00:30:07,219
Now, that's what they call...
Soul food.

292
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,221
Now, you got black-eyed peas,

293
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:12,223
turnip Greens... Chitlins...

294
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:16,478
Collard Greens, pig
feet, cornbread...

295
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:19,481
Pork butts... And for dessert...

296
00:30:19,482 --> 00:30:20,483
Watermelon!

297
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:29,658
Eat heartily, gentlemen.

298
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,162
The grand jury is gonna
fail to indict Tommy Gibbs and his old man.

299
00:30:34,163 --> 00:30:36,164
That's right.

300
00:30:36,165 --> 00:30:38,166
We're both gonna be
found innocent...

301
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:42,921
Victims of racial slurs
and police conspiracy.

302
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:44,923
Diangelo here is gonna
fix it up for me.

303
00:30:44,924 --> 00:30:48,059
Ain't that right, Diangelo?

304
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,062
Anything can be fixed
in the good ol' usa.

305
00:30:51,063 --> 00:30:52,681
Didn't have to do this, Tommy.

306
00:30:52,682 --> 00:30:55,183
We could've sat down and talked.

307
00:30:55,184 --> 00:30:57,686
Well, maybe
I just wasn't brought up right.

308
00:30:57,687 --> 00:30:59,572
I don't happen to trust people.

309
00:31:00,072 --> 00:31:01,573
I sorta figured
if you thought I was weak,

310
00:31:01,574 --> 00:31:03,575
you'd mop the street up with me,

311
00:31:03,576 --> 00:31:06,077
and I'd have to kill a lot more of
your people to put you in your place.

312
00:31:06,078 --> 00:31:09,080
Now, if I don't get
what I want, Diangelo,

313
00:31:09,081 --> 00:31:12,584
that means war.

314
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:14,586
War like you never seen before.

315
00:31:14,587 --> 00:31:16,337
None of this old-time bullshit

316
00:31:16,338 --> 00:31:19,341
going after
your numbers runners or your pushers.

317
00:31:19,842 --> 00:31:22,594
No, I'll be going after your...

318
00:31:22,595 --> 00:31:27,098
Bank presidents,
heads of corporations.

319
00:31:27,099 --> 00:31:29,100
It'll look like
a race riot to everybody.

320
00:31:29,101 --> 00:31:34,106
But you'll know what it is.

321
00:31:34,356 --> 00:31:36,858
Tell you what
I'm gonna do, Diangelo.

322
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:37,899
I'm gonna make you a hero.

323
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:44,616
I'm gonna let you
arrest Tommy Gibbs.

324
00:31:45,117 --> 00:31:46,484
A grand jury today

325
00:31:46,485 --> 00:31:48,987
dismissed all charges
against Tommy Gibbs

326
00:31:48,988 --> 00:31:51,623
and his father Thomas Gibbs, sr.

327
00:31:51,624 --> 00:31:53,625
A massive investigation
has been ordered

328
00:31:53,626 --> 00:31:55,627
into alleged police conspiracies

329
00:31:55,628 --> 00:31:56,629
to assassinate Gibbs,

330
00:31:57,129 --> 00:31:58,630
the self-styled "Black Caesar"

331
00:31:58,631 --> 00:32:00,633
of Harlem's underworld.

332
00:32:37,036 --> 00:32:42,291
Got the man working late.

333
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:45,294
Well... Gentlemen.

334
00:32:45,795 --> 00:32:48,296
Mr. Diangelo.

335
00:32:48,297 --> 00:32:50,298
I want you to know that I,

336
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:52,300
certainly appreciate you

337
00:32:52,301 --> 00:32:54,302
fixing up
them murder charges against me.

338
00:32:54,303 --> 00:32:57,806
However, you will not be taking
your instructions from me.

339
00:32:57,807 --> 00:33:02,060
You'll be getting them
from Mr. Gibbs, sr. Over there.

340
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:04,062
I think you know him.

341
00:33:04,063 --> 00:33:06,064
Yes, we know one another.

342
00:33:06,065 --> 00:33:08,566
We have met in very high places.

343
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:11,569
Mr. Gibbs, I... I...

344
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:14,572
I mean, the whole thing
was... was a terrible mistake.

345
00:33:14,573 --> 00:33:19,077
I... I...
That's all right, Mr. Diangelo.

346
00:33:19,078 --> 00:33:20,578
I'd like for you to meet

347
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:25,083
another
very important member of my organization.

348
00:33:25,084 --> 00:33:27,585
This here is Mr. Zachariah,

349
00:33:27,586 --> 00:33:29,470
my enforcer. However,

350
00:33:29,471 --> 00:33:30,972
I suggest you call him Zach.

351
00:33:30,973 --> 00:33:36,227
He's a very ambitious young man.

352
00:33:36,228 --> 00:33:38,730
I'm gonna follow you all over.

353
00:33:38,731 --> 00:33:40,732
When you go to the airport,

354
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:41,733
I'll be your ticket.

355
00:33:41,734 --> 00:33:43,235
When you walk down the street,

356
00:33:43,736 --> 00:33:46,237
I'll be your shadow.

357
00:33:46,238 --> 00:33:47,238
In other words,

358
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:49,741
I'm gonna be all over your ass.

359
00:33:49,742 --> 00:33:52,110
Gentlemen...
I mean, after all, gentlemen,

360
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:54,112
you can trust me.

361
00:33:54,113 --> 00:33:56,114
I mean, let's...

362
00:33:56,115 --> 00:33:57,615
Let's look forward
to the future.

363
00:33:57,616 --> 00:33:59,117
Let's not dwell on the past.

364
00:33:59,118 --> 00:34:00,119
Let's forget the past.

365
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:03,121
No, we won't forget
the past, Mr. Diangelo.

366
00:34:03,122 --> 00:34:05,374
It's the past. Yes, the past.

367
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:12,347
Look around.

368
00:34:12,348 --> 00:34:14,849
<i>When we close down his drug operation,</i>

369
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,352
poor Diangelo ain't gonna
have nothing left

370
00:34:17,353 --> 00:34:19,855
but his salary
as a public servant.

371
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,489
Let me hear
somebody say "wonderful"!

372
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:39,991
Wonderful!

373
00:34:39,992 --> 00:34:42,994
Let me hear
somebody say "hallelujah"!

374
00:34:42,995 --> 00:34:43,995
Hallelujah!

375
00:34:43,996 --> 00:34:47,498
Let me hear somebody say "amen"!

376
00:34:47,499 --> 00:34:48,500
Amen!

377
00:34:49,001 --> 00:34:50,001
Amen.

378
00:34:50,002 --> 00:34:53,004
I want you
to lift your head up high

379
00:34:53,005 --> 00:34:55,506
and... and hold your hands apart

380
00:34:55,507 --> 00:34:57,508
and just clench your fists

381
00:34:57,509 --> 00:34:59,010
and tighten them up.

382
00:34:59,011 --> 00:35:01,512
I want you to go out
in the streets

383
00:35:01,513 --> 00:35:02,513
and... and fight the dope

384
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:04,015
and fight the crime

385
00:35:04,016 --> 00:35:05,517
and fight the murdering.

386
00:35:06,018 --> 00:35:09,020
I want you to go up against
people like Tommy Gibbs

387
00:35:09,021 --> 00:35:10,522
and his father!

388
00:35:18,163 --> 00:35:19,664
Hello, reverend.

389
00:35:19,665 --> 00:35:21,666
Hello.

390
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:24,669
I watched you on TV tonight.

391
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:28,539
You must get your kicks
out of hearing your name mentioned.

392
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,042
You're causing me
a lot of problems, Rufus.

393
00:35:31,043 --> 00:35:33,544
I'm pleased to hear
I'm so effective.

394
00:35:33,545 --> 00:35:35,046
You weren't so high-and-mighty

395
00:35:35,047 --> 00:35:37,549
when you were
pimping for me up on Lennox Avenue.

396
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,551
That was before
I heard my calling.

397
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:41,552
Man, don't try to sell me

398
00:35:41,553 --> 00:35:44,055
that you believe
in that religious bullshit!

399
00:35:44,056 --> 00:35:46,557
I know you too well.

400
00:35:46,558 --> 00:35:48,059
It's big money,

401
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,061
and you always did
have some smarts.

402
00:35:50,062 --> 00:35:52,063
Yeah, it started like that.

403
00:35:52,064 --> 00:35:54,065
But I found out that I could...

404
00:35:54,066 --> 00:35:56,567
I could help people.

405
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:58,569
I'm gonna put you out of Harlem.

406
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,571
You and your old man.

407
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:02,573
They tried to shoot my ass out,

408
00:36:02,574 --> 00:36:06,077
so I guess you gonna
pray my ass out, right?

409
00:36:06,078 --> 00:36:09,080
I'm gonna appeal
to all the decent black folks

410
00:36:09,081 --> 00:36:12,333
that don't want nobody
like you running their lives.

411
00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:13,835
Why don't you go after
those white bosses

412
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:15,337
that are selling heroin
to the kids?

413
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:17,839
And I suppose
you're not into that?

414
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,842
I'm not into drugs, Rufus.

415
00:36:20,843 --> 00:36:22,844
I'm shutting out the suppliers.

416
00:36:22,845 --> 00:36:24,846
I'm knocking out all the pushers

417
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:26,347
as quick as I can find 'em!

418
00:36:26,348 --> 00:36:27,849
Murdering them.

419
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,327
Well, what the hell do
you think they're doing

420
00:36:29,351 --> 00:36:34,355
selling that shit on
the streets to the kids?

421
00:36:34,356 --> 00:36:38,860
Rufus... Don't turn on me.

422
00:36:38,861 --> 00:36:41,362
Not when I'm trying.

423
00:36:41,363 --> 00:36:45,366
I don't believe you.

424
00:36:45,367 --> 00:36:48,369
If there's money in it
in the black community,

425
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,871
you grab it off the top.

426
00:36:49,872 --> 00:36:51,873
Well, I guess we just
don't know each other anymore,

427
00:36:51,874 --> 00:36:53,508
do we, Rufus?

428
00:36:55,511 --> 00:36:57,763
Take him back where you got him.

429
00:37:04,269 --> 00:37:06,654
Are you comfortable in my chair?

430
00:37:06,655 --> 00:37:08,523
You damn right.

431
00:37:08,524 --> 00:37:13,528
Well, then you get
your dead ass out of it right now.

432
00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:14,530
Now!

433
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:30,045
I caught this broad
running around downstairs again, man.

434
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:32,680
Why don't you let me off that broad?

435
00:37:32,681 --> 00:37:36,184
I'd have thought that
you'd be gone,

436
00:37:36,185 --> 00:37:39,187
started someplace else.

437
00:37:39,188 --> 00:37:41,689
I couldn't.

438
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,191
What do you want?

439
00:37:43,192 --> 00:37:44,692
I wanna talk to Tommy.

440
00:37:44,693 --> 00:37:46,695
I got the right.

441
00:37:47,196 --> 00:37:49,197
Look, whatever happened to him,

442
00:37:49,198 --> 00:37:51,199
he should settle with me now.

443
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,701
I wanna see him.

444
00:37:58,824 --> 00:37:59,824
Tommy, you're looking at me

445
00:37:59,825 --> 00:38:02,827
as though you've never
seen me before.

446
00:38:02,828 --> 00:38:04,830
We had a lot going once.

447
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:07,832
You knew I never wanted to
get involved in the business.

448
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:10,335
You forced me into it.

449
00:38:10,836 --> 00:38:13,337
I just wasn't
strong enough to handle it.

450
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:15,723
She left me for my best friend Joe.

451
00:38:15,724 --> 00:38:18,843
She had 2 of his kids,
then she had him killed...

452
00:38:18,844 --> 00:38:20,344
Just like she tried to do to me.

453
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:21,596
Go away!

454
00:38:21,597 --> 00:38:25,233
What do you wanna do, kill me?

455
00:38:25,234 --> 00:38:27,235
I'd welcome that.

456
00:38:27,236 --> 00:38:29,605
Maybe I'll make you kill me.

457
00:38:30,105 --> 00:38:34,108
You won't be
rid of me till you do.

458
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:37,612
I'm not gonna run away anymore.

459
00:38:37,613 --> 00:38:39,615
And I'm not
gonna keep away from the kids.

460
00:38:40,115 --> 00:38:41,365
They're our kids now.

461
00:38:41,366 --> 00:38:43,367
And if you want me
out of the way,

462
00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:44,869
you'll have to put
a bullet in me,

463
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:46,871
so you might as well do it now.

464
00:38:46,872 --> 00:38:50,124
Ain't nobody gonna touch
a hair on your head.

465
00:38:50,125 --> 00:38:52,627
You're
the safest woman in New York City.

466
00:38:52,628 --> 00:38:56,380
You can walk any street
any time at night

467
00:38:56,381 --> 00:39:00,885
and ain't nothing
gonna happen to you.

468
00:39:00,886 --> 00:39:03,387
I don't wanna see her again, pa,

469
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:05,273
any time, any place.

470
00:39:05,274 --> 00:39:07,276
I'll keep her away.

471
00:39:29,164 --> 00:39:31,165
Feel like I'm back
in Sunday school again.

472
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:32,667
What are you doing here?

473
00:39:32,668 --> 00:39:34,669
Just passing through.

474
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,170
Who's she?

475
00:39:36,171 --> 00:39:37,672
Sister Jennifer.

476
00:39:38,173 --> 00:39:39,674
Yeah?

477
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:42,176
You do a team act now?

478
00:39:42,177 --> 00:39:45,180
This your number one trick?

479
00:39:45,681 --> 00:39:48,182
You don't have
to antagonize me, Mr. Gibbs.

480
00:39:48,183 --> 00:39:51,185
I happen to believe
that you are a decent man.

481
00:39:51,186 --> 00:39:54,822
He's always had a knack
for foolin' women.

482
00:39:54,823 --> 00:40:00,328
Reverend Rufus,
why must we single him out?

483
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:02,331
We have the names
of all the syndicate men

484
00:40:02,831 --> 00:40:04,832
who have exploited
the black community

485
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:06,834
since we were all children.

486
00:40:06,835 --> 00:40:08,836
Why don't we
speak out against them?

487
00:40:08,837 --> 00:40:09,837
Yeah, I'll consider it.

488
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:12,340
No, no. Answer her now, Rufus.

489
00:40:12,841 --> 00:40:15,343
Tell her
that your financial support

490
00:40:15,344 --> 00:40:17,345
comes from whitey.

491
00:40:17,346 --> 00:40:18,846
And that...

492
00:40:18,847 --> 00:40:21,849
They wanna hear
about blacks exploiting blacks.

493
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:24,352
You got a program on TV,

494
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:27,855
you gotta give 'em
what they wanna hear about.

495
00:40:27,856 --> 00:40:29,857
Thank you, miss.

496
00:40:29,858 --> 00:40:32,360
You got a lot to learn, and,

497
00:40:32,361 --> 00:40:35,363
I don't think you're
gonna find it all in the Bible.

498
00:40:35,364 --> 00:40:38,366
How about dinner tomorrow night?

499
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:40,368
Thank you. No.

500
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:41,370
Why not?

501
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,372
You scared?

502
00:40:44,373 --> 00:40:49,377
Yes... slightly.

503
00:40:49,378 --> 00:40:50,878
But not nearly as much

504
00:40:50,879 --> 00:40:55,383
as I am amused
of your arrogance, Mr. Gibbs.

505
00:40:55,384 --> 00:40:59,004
You seem to think
that you can handle everyone and everything

506
00:40:59,504 --> 00:41:03,507
by a quick smile
and a fast remark.

507
00:41:03,508 --> 00:41:05,509
Does it bug you
that I can pull it off?

508
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:09,514
No... But you haven't.

509
00:41:10,015 --> 00:41:13,517
You happen to be
a very lonely man, Mr. Gibbs.

510
00:41:13,518 --> 00:41:17,521
A sad man.

511
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:20,024
Like the man said, lady...

512
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:22,526
You givin' me the blues.

513
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:23,527
Anyway...

514
00:41:23,528 --> 00:41:26,030
I was just passing
through because I,

515
00:41:26,031 --> 00:41:27,031
I thought I'd drop this off

516
00:41:27,032 --> 00:41:28,532
in your collection plate.

517
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:30,034
I'm sorry about the other night.

518
00:41:30,035 --> 00:41:31,535
No need for
you and I to be enemies.

519
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:33,538
Don't take that!

520
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:36,041
$5,000?

521
00:41:38,043 --> 00:41:41,045
This'll feed
an awful lot of families.

522
00:41:41,046 --> 00:41:44,548
Looks like the lady don't
listen too good, Rufus.

523
00:41:44,549 --> 00:41:46,050
Well, babe...

524
00:41:46,051 --> 00:41:48,171
Any time you
get lonely for somebody other than Jesus,

525
00:41:48,553 --> 00:41:51,055
Rufus here
can give you my private number.

526
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,703
Mr. Gibbs, I really would like to see you.

527
00:42:05,704 --> 00:42:09,707
I believe...
You and I could be friends.

528
00:47:31,646 --> 00:47:33,648
Tell Tommy "thanks."

529
00:47:40,155 --> 00:47:43,158
Tommy had nothing to do with it.

530
00:48:13,438 --> 00:48:16,440
Hello, can I speak <i>to Diangelo?</i>

531
00:48:16,441 --> 00:48:17,942
Yes. Hello, Zach.

532
00:48:18,443 --> 00:48:20,077
I've been waiting for your call.

533
00:48:20,445 --> 00:48:21,946
Our little business
is taken care of?

534
00:48:22,447 --> 00:48:23,948
It's all over.

535
00:48:24,449 --> 00:48:25,450
Good.

536
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:26,950
No witnesses?

537
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:28,335
Nope.

538
00:48:28,336 --> 00:48:30,838
That's very good to hear, Zach.

539
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:32,706
You know, I do believe
you and I are gonna have

540
00:48:32,707 --> 00:48:39,379
a great future, kid.

541
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,380
All right, Gibbs,

542
00:48:40,381 --> 00:48:42,382
Diangelo wants you downtown.

543
00:48:42,383 --> 00:48:43,384
Let's go.

544
00:49:11,796 --> 00:49:14,164
Ok, Diangelo, I'm a busy man.

545
00:49:14,165 --> 00:49:15,165
We're looking into the murder

546
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:20,672
of a young lady named...
Helen Bradley.

547
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,681
Why so shocked?

548
00:49:30,682 --> 00:49:32,182
She was a 2-bit whore.

549
00:49:32,183 --> 00:49:36,186
She worked around
the 47th Street area.

550
00:49:36,187 --> 00:49:38,689
Was better looking
than most, but...

551
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:42,943
Can't tell that from
the police photographs.

552
00:49:42,944 --> 00:49:51,952
Here... Take a look at them.

553
00:49:51,953 --> 00:49:54,454
Maybe you can identify the body.

554
00:49:54,455 --> 00:49:56,456
You care to go down
to the morgue with me?

555
00:49:56,457 --> 00:50:01,595
Who killed her?

556
00:50:02,096 --> 00:50:04,598
A lot of them end up this way...

557
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:07,601
Murdered by one of their Johns.

558
00:50:07,602 --> 00:50:12,105
Much more merciful
than an advanced case of syphilis, right?

559
00:50:12,106 --> 00:50:14,107
It was strangulation.

560
00:50:14,108 --> 00:50:16,610
Very professional job.

561
00:50:16,611 --> 00:50:18,612
She was an old friend
of yours, wasn't she?

562
00:50:18,613 --> 00:50:20,614
I knew her.

563
00:50:20,615 --> 00:50:25,619
She must've been
a beautiful woman once.

564
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:30,123
I understand she,
had a couple of kids.

565
00:50:30,124 --> 00:50:31,124
It's kind of a blessing

566
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:33,127
that they'll never find out

567
00:50:33,628 --> 00:50:37,130
what kind of profession
mama was in.

568
00:50:37,131 --> 00:50:38,132
What time was she killed?

569
00:50:38,633 --> 00:50:40,634
Tommy,
there's no charge against you,

570
00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:42,636
for crying out loud.

571
00:50:42,637 --> 00:50:47,140
It's a much more
delicate matter than that.

572
00:50:47,141 --> 00:50:51,645
I mean, we're good
friends, aren't we?

573
00:50:51,646 --> 00:50:57,150
And, I mean,
it's really difficult to...

574
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,652
To bring up
the matter of your father.

575
00:50:59,153 --> 00:51:01,655
I mean, what's
one little whore, more or less?

576
00:51:01,656 --> 00:51:04,658
It doesn't make any difference.

577
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:06,159
But we have very good
reason to believe

578
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,661
your father was responsible.

579
00:51:07,662 --> 00:51:09,664
I don't believe you.

580
00:51:18,172 --> 00:51:20,674
You're a loyal son, Tommy.

581
00:51:20,675 --> 00:51:22,542
Really, I hope my kids
grow up the same way

582
00:51:22,543 --> 00:51:24,544
and feel that way about me.

583
00:51:24,545 --> 00:51:27,047
Probably did it for your sake.

584
00:51:27,048 --> 00:51:29,049
That's the way parents are.

585
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:30,550
Is that all?

586
00:51:30,551 --> 00:51:32,832
I just want you to know
I'm not gonna do anything about it

587
00:51:33,054 --> 00:51:35,056
out of deference to you.

588
00:51:46,951 --> 00:51:47,951
You know everything
that goes on.

589
00:51:47,952 --> 00:51:49,953
Who killed Helen?

590
00:51:49,954 --> 00:51:50,954
Who killed her?

591
00:51:50,955 --> 00:51:52,956
Your father.

592
00:51:52,957 --> 00:51:54,959
Your father paid for it.

593
00:52:15,229 --> 00:52:17,230
I don't know
what's keeping Mr. Gibbs,

594
00:52:17,231 --> 00:52:24,488
but we'll hold dinner
until he arrives.

595
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:26,990
Tommy's asked me to be his wife.

596
00:52:26,991 --> 00:52:28,608
What do you think, reverend?

597
00:52:28,609 --> 00:52:29,609
If you want my advice,

598
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:33,363
you'd go back to your preaching.

599
00:52:33,364 --> 00:52:34,364
It's about time.

600
00:52:34,365 --> 00:52:36,867
I'm starving to death.

601
00:52:36,868 --> 00:52:40,871
Daddy,
is Jennifer gonna be my mommy?

602
00:52:40,872 --> 00:52:43,373
Take him upstairs.
Put him to bed.

603
00:52:43,374 --> 00:52:45,375
I don't wanna go to bed yet.

604
00:52:45,376 --> 00:52:46,877
But he hasn't had his dinner.

605
00:52:46,878 --> 00:52:50,881
Do like I say.
Take him upstairs.

606
00:52:50,882 --> 00:52:51,882
Come on, honey.

607
00:52:51,883 --> 00:52:53,633
Kiss your
grandfather good night.

608
00:52:53,634 --> 00:52:56,136
Good night, grandfather.

609
00:52:56,137 --> 00:53:01,141
Good night, son.

610
00:53:01,142 --> 00:53:06,646
You go save some souls.

611
00:53:06,647 --> 00:53:08,148
Good night, Mr. Gibbs.

612
00:53:08,149 --> 00:53:10,150
Good night, reverend.

613
00:53:10,151 --> 00:53:16,907
It's been good to
see you for a second.

614
00:53:16,908 --> 00:53:18,909
Helen didn't just get killed.

615
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:21,411
It was a professional job.

616
00:53:21,412 --> 00:53:22,913
Well, why are you telling me?

617
00:53:22,914 --> 00:53:25,415
I thought you might
be interested.

618
00:53:27,919 --> 00:53:29,920
That woman
was nothing but grief to you.

619
00:53:29,921 --> 00:53:30,922
You ought to be grateful.

620
00:53:31,422 --> 00:53:33,924
Grateful?

621
00:53:33,925 --> 00:53:37,428
To you, pa?

622
00:53:37,929 --> 00:53:40,180
You think I
had something to do to do with her death?

623
00:53:40,181 --> 00:53:41,681
I gave you strict orders

624
00:53:41,682 --> 00:53:44,184
that she was to be left alone.

625
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:46,319
You know I don't
go against you, son.

626
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:52,826
You're a stinking liar!

627
00:53:53,327 --> 00:53:56,830
This is your father
you're talking to.

628
00:53:56,831 --> 00:54:02,335
Maybe you think
you give the orders around here.

629
00:54:02,336 --> 00:54:05,338
Well...
I've been doing pretty good

630
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:07,841
with the territory you gave me.

631
00:54:07,842 --> 00:54:09,843
You got any complaints?

632
00:54:09,844 --> 00:54:11,344
Yeah.

633
00:54:11,345 --> 00:54:13,847
I got some complaints.

634
00:54:13,848 --> 00:54:15,849
Lots of 'em.

635
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:17,350
I'm sick of you.

636
00:54:17,351 --> 00:54:18,852
I'm sick of this town!

637
00:54:18,853 --> 00:54:22,856
I haven't had
one moment's pleasure.

638
00:54:22,857 --> 00:54:25,358
You know what I'm gonna do, pa?

639
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:26,860
I'm gonna give it all to you,

640
00:54:26,861 --> 00:54:29,863
and I'm gonna go to
Detroit and Los Angeles

641
00:54:29,864 --> 00:54:30,864
and look after
my other interests

642
00:54:30,865 --> 00:54:33,867
and leave this all
in your capable hands!

643
00:54:33,868 --> 00:54:35,368
It's getting too expensive

644
00:54:35,369 --> 00:54:37,370
to run an operation
in this town anyway.

645
00:54:37,371 --> 00:54:38,872
Payoffs are too damn high.

646
00:54:38,873 --> 00:54:42,375
I appreciate
your confidence in me.

647
00:54:42,376 --> 00:54:45,378
I'll see how long
you can cut it, old man,

648
00:54:45,379 --> 00:54:48,882
without me around
to protect your black ass.

649
00:54:49,383 --> 00:54:51,885
I don't recall
asking you for anything

650
00:54:51,886 --> 00:54:53,386
in a very long time.

651
00:54:53,387 --> 00:54:54,888
After I'm gone,

652
00:54:54,889 --> 00:54:56,867
a lot of people
are gonna try to move you out of business

653
00:54:56,891 --> 00:54:59,392
so don't expect me
to come back and hold your hand!

654
00:54:59,393 --> 00:55:00,894
Tommy, can't you see?

655
00:55:00,895 --> 00:55:02,896
Even in death, this woman
is tearing us apart!

656
00:55:02,897 --> 00:55:04,397
You had no right
to do that to her!

657
00:55:04,398 --> 00:55:05,899
Whatever she was...

658
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,902
Whatever I say
you wouldn't believe, would you?

659
00:55:14,408 --> 00:55:15,909
Pack your bags.

660
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:17,911
What?

661
00:55:17,912 --> 00:55:20,914
Pack the kids', too.
We're leaving.

662
00:55:20,915 --> 00:55:23,917
Gonna leave everything
to... to...

663
00:55:23,918 --> 00:55:27,921
Big papa.

664
00:55:27,922 --> 00:55:30,424
We'll get married
in Los Angeles.

665
00:55:41,552 --> 00:55:45,055
Mr. Gibbs...

666
00:55:45,056 --> 00:55:49,559
Is there anything
I can do to help?

667
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,061
No, darling.

668
00:55:51,062 --> 00:55:52,563
Between me and my son.

669
00:57:09,095 --> 00:57:10,595
Hi, mama.

670
00:57:10,596 --> 00:57:13,098
Sorry it took me
so long to get here,

671
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:16,101
but I've been a very busy man.

672
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:18,603
I'm in a new life now.

673
00:57:18,604 --> 00:57:20,105
Killing, women.

674
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:21,723
Lot of women.

675
00:57:21,724 --> 00:57:23,225
Things that you
would be ashamed of,

676
00:57:23,226 --> 00:57:24,726
and I hope you forgive me.

677
00:57:24,727 --> 00:57:26,729
I miss you, and I love you.

678
00:57:43,129 --> 00:57:46,131
Nobody, but nobody,
talks to Tommy.

679
00:57:46,132 --> 00:57:48,133
Listen, Zach killed Helen.

680
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:50,635
He's trying to make
his own deal with Diangelo.

681
00:57:50,636 --> 00:57:52,637
He's hidin' out
up at Grant's tomb.

682
00:57:52,638 --> 00:57:55,640
Send the boys up there
and ice his bad ass!

683
00:57:55,641 --> 00:57:57,142
Any dealing done in this town

684
00:57:57,143 --> 00:57:58,644
will be done through me.

685
00:58:06,903 --> 00:58:08,905
Son of a bitch!

686
00:58:50,196 --> 00:58:53,199
This is compliments
of me and Mr. Diangelo.

687
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:06,711
Something's bothering you.

688
00:59:06,712 --> 00:59:09,214
Is it what they say in
the newspapers about you?

689
00:59:09,715 --> 00:59:11,216
Like I promised you
before I married you,

690
00:59:11,217 --> 00:59:13,218
I'm going 100 percent legit.

691
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:15,220
What about
your father in New York?

692
00:59:15,221 --> 00:59:16,722
The entire organization?

693
00:59:17,223 --> 00:59:19,724
I got no control over that.
They're just friends.

694
00:59:19,725 --> 00:59:21,226
I can't tell them how
to make a living.

695
00:59:21,227 --> 00:59:25,231
You still don't see anything
wrong in killing people

696
00:59:25,731 --> 00:59:27,732
and taking what's theirs.

697
00:59:27,733 --> 00:59:30,235
Not if they took it
from somebody first.

698
00:59:30,236 --> 00:59:33,238
But we've been through all that.

699
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:35,240
I've already proved
that I was the best,

700
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:36,741
so I don't need it no more.

701
00:59:36,742 --> 00:59:39,244
Tommy, you talk about
renouncing the rackets

702
00:59:39,245 --> 00:59:42,248
as I would if I were asked
to give up my belief in god.

703
01:00:43,175 --> 01:00:44,676
Zach?

704
01:01:38,364 --> 01:01:40,365
Zach.

705
01:01:40,366 --> 01:01:41,867
Son of a bitch! Zach!

706
01:02:34,787 --> 01:02:37,288
Hey, old man.

707
01:02:37,289 --> 01:02:39,791
I see you got your nurses.

708
01:02:39,792 --> 01:02:41,543
Seems to me
you're trying to set yourself up

709
01:02:41,544 --> 01:02:44,546
in your own business?

710
01:02:44,547 --> 01:02:49,551
First Helen...
Then a few of the boys.

711
01:02:49,552 --> 01:02:52,053
Next it'll be me.
Then maybe Tommy?

712
01:02:52,054 --> 01:02:53,304
Tommy?

713
01:02:53,305 --> 01:02:54,806
I already got him.

714
01:02:54,807 --> 01:02:57,308
Look around. I own it.

715
01:02:57,309 --> 01:02:58,443
All of it.

716
01:02:58,444 --> 01:03:01,446
Well, I'm gonna
take back what is mine.

717
01:03:01,447 --> 01:03:03,064
You don't have too long.

718
01:03:03,065 --> 01:03:05,567
You know you got a slow ticker.

719
01:03:05,568 --> 01:03:06,951
You could go any minute.

720
01:03:06,952 --> 01:03:08,453
You need a whipping, boy.

721
01:03:08,454 --> 01:03:09,955
Boy? Where you see a boy?

722
01:03:10,456 --> 01:03:13,958
And I'm gonna do it
with these own 2 hands.

723
01:03:13,959 --> 01:03:17,962
You sure that's the way
you want it, old man?

724
01:03:17,963 --> 01:03:19,964
No guns, fellas.

725
01:03:19,965 --> 01:03:25,470
I'm gonna beat this boy
with my own 2 hands.

726
01:03:25,471 --> 01:03:27,973
The old man's gonna whup my ass?

727
01:05:31,797 --> 01:05:35,301
I want every railroad
terminal, bus depot,

728
01:05:35,801 --> 01:05:37,802
and airport checked.

729
01:05:37,803 --> 01:05:39,804
And the minute Gibbs
gets back in town,

730
01:05:39,805 --> 01:05:41,806
I want to be
notified immediately.

731
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:43,308
Is that understood?

732
01:05:43,309 --> 01:05:48,313
All right.

733
01:05:48,314 --> 01:05:49,814
Don't go to New York.

734
01:05:49,815 --> 01:05:51,316
They want you
to step back in New York

735
01:05:51,317 --> 01:05:54,819
so they can blow your head off.

736
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,821
Hap.

737
01:05:56,822 --> 01:05:58,824
Make reservations
to New York City.

738
01:05:59,325 --> 01:06:03,328
You got no organization
back there no more, Tommy.

739
01:06:03,329 --> 01:06:04,829
Zach took it all.

740
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:06,331
You got nothing.

741
01:06:06,332 --> 01:06:07,832
I started with nothing,

742
01:06:07,833 --> 01:06:09,835
and I can take back what's mine.

743
01:06:10,336 --> 01:06:13,338
Hap.

744
01:06:13,339 --> 01:06:17,842
Change those
reservations to Philly.

745
01:06:17,843 --> 01:06:20,846
I'm going to ease into
New York... quiet-like.

746
01:06:27,353 --> 01:06:29,354
I got me some
funerals to attend.

747
01:06:29,355 --> 01:06:31,356
Well, Diangelo, here it is.

748
01:06:31,357 --> 01:06:34,359
I got it made.

749
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,861
Yeah, if Gibbs doesn't
take it away from you.

750
01:06:36,862 --> 01:06:39,364
Take what? Hell,
I ain't running.

751
01:06:39,365 --> 01:06:41,367
All he likes to do is read
the wall street journal,

752
01:06:41,867 --> 01:06:42,867
get clean and go to church.

753
01:06:42,868 --> 01:06:44,369
Well, as they say,

754
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:46,871
a young man should never retire.

755
01:06:46,872 --> 01:06:48,874
Unless he's ready to die.

756
01:06:50,376 --> 01:06:51,876
He's a candy-ass.

757
01:06:51,877 --> 01:06:53,878
I flew
to California, man, out to his house,

758
01:06:53,879 --> 01:06:55,880
fired some shots in the crib,

759
01:06:55,881 --> 01:06:57,882
and he didn't
have the balls to do a damn thing.

760
01:06:57,883 --> 01:06:59,884
He didn't even
have the balls to come after me.

761
01:06:59,885 --> 01:07:02,019
He didn't
have the balls to do nothing.

762
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:04,021
<i>I even killed his old man.</i>

763
01:07:04,022 --> 01:07:05,523
No balls at all.

764
01:07:05,524 --> 01:07:07,025
<i>"No balls" Gibbs.</i>

765
01:08:05,334 --> 01:08:07,335
<i>Listen close.</i>

766
01:08:07,336 --> 01:08:09,837
I've always been the best
hit man in the business,

767
01:08:09,838 --> 01:08:11,339
and I got a contract to fill

768
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:14,342
on every son of a bitch that
works for Diangelo or Zach.

769
01:08:14,343 --> 01:08:16,844
I'm closing down the city.

770
01:08:16,845 --> 01:08:19,848
I'm going to make New York
a decent place to live.

771
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:34,492
Police continue to hunt
the professional killer

772
01:11:34,993 --> 01:11:36,494
who, within the last 24 hours,

773
01:11:36,495 --> 01:11:39,497
has struck down
leading members of New York's underworld.

774
01:11:39,498 --> 01:11:40,998
An official statement

775
01:11:40,999 --> 01:11:43,501
issued by the office
of James Diangelo

776
01:11:43,502 --> 01:11:45,503
concedes that
there are no new leads

777
01:11:45,504 --> 01:11:47,004
as to the identity
of the gunman,

778
01:11:47,005 --> 01:11:50,007
described by witnesses
only as a black man

779
01:11:50,008 --> 01:11:51,509
in his early 30s.

780
01:12:15,033 --> 01:12:17,034
He's
undermining everything we've built up

781
01:12:17,035 --> 01:12:18,035
all these years.

782
01:12:18,036 --> 01:12:19,537
Don't sweat it, man.

783
01:12:19,538 --> 01:12:20,671
We'll ice him.

784
01:12:20,672 --> 01:12:22,673
Now,
there's one thing Gibbs prizes

785
01:12:22,674 --> 01:12:24,175
more than anything
in this world,

786
01:12:24,176 --> 01:12:25,676
and that's his family.

787
01:12:25,677 --> 01:12:27,178
His wife gave her soul back

788
01:12:27,179 --> 01:12:30,182
to the almighty
lord Jesus Christ.

789
01:12:31,683 --> 01:12:33,685
And she even ran away
with the baby girl.

790
01:12:34,186 --> 01:12:35,687
There's still the other child.

791
01:12:36,188 --> 01:12:37,189
What's his name?

792
01:12:37,689 --> 01:12:38,689
Jason.

793
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:40,191
Must be about 8 years old now.

794
01:12:40,692 --> 01:12:43,194
Hey, hey. Hey,
I thought I'd do anything for the man,

795
01:12:43,195 --> 01:12:45,696
but killing kids, that's a no.

796
01:12:45,697 --> 01:12:49,200
That's why I can't
trust anybody to do anything

797
01:12:49,201 --> 01:12:53,572
except myself.

798
01:12:54,072 --> 01:12:55,573
<i>Senator Brown,</i>

799
01:12:55,574 --> 01:12:59,076
I'm sending you a present for
your investigating committee...

800
01:12:59,077 --> 01:13:01,579
Ledgers with the names
of all the politicians

801
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:04,466
who've been taking payoffs
since the 1950s.

802
01:13:04,966 --> 01:13:06,467
Don't try to find me
to say thanks,

803
01:13:06,468 --> 01:13:07,788
because I'll be
out of the country

804
01:13:07,969 --> 01:13:09,337
by the time you receive this.

805
01:13:09,838 --> 01:13:10,838
I'm giving you some help

806
01:13:10,839 --> 01:13:13,340
by eliminating
a few of the boys myself.

807
01:13:13,341 --> 01:13:14,341
Heh heh.

808
01:13:26,855 --> 01:13:27,856
Bring it on! It's Gibbs!

809
01:15:27,976 --> 01:15:28,976
Where's Zach?

810
01:15:28,977 --> 01:15:29,978
I don't know.

811
01:16:06,898 --> 01:16:08,399
Where's Zach?

812
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:11,402
TWA... Airport.

813
01:17:36,821 --> 01:17:38,322
Trans world airlines

814
01:17:38,323 --> 01:17:41,325
flight number 27 for Los Angeles

815
01:17:41,326 --> 01:17:43,711
is now in its final
boarding process

816
01:17:43,712 --> 01:17:44,713
at gate 7.

01:17:53,972 --> 01:17:57,474
<i>Final call for TWA flight 27</i>

for Los Angeles.

819
01:18:19,497 --> 01:18:20,998
The next flight
to I.A... what gate?

820
01:18:20,999 --> 01:18:22,500
Gate 7.

821
01:18:48,893 --> 01:18:50,894
When's the next flight
to I.A.? Any airline.

822
01:18:50,895 --> 01:18:52,396
American airlines, in 5 minutes.

823
01:18:52,897 --> 01:18:53,397
You'll never make it.

824
01:18:53,398 --> 01:18:54,398
Bullshit!

825
01:20:00,715 --> 01:20:06,353
First class, Los Angeles.

826
01:20:06,354 --> 01:20:09,973
American airlines
flight 5 for Los Angeles

827
01:20:09,974 --> 01:20:13,727
is boarding on gate number 7.

828
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,501
Our flight time to Los Angeles

829
01:20:37,502 --> 01:20:39,504
will be 4 hours and 5 minutes.

830
01:22:04,973 --> 01:22:06,473
<i>Please fasten your seatbelts</i>

831
01:22:06,474 --> 01:22:08,475
and extinguish all cigarettes

in preparation
for our landing in Los Angeles.

833
01:23:19,914 --> 01:23:22,416
What the hell are they doing over there?

834
01:23:22,417 --> 01:23:24,301
That's my suitcase!

835
01:23:24,302 --> 01:23:25,803
Jesus Christ! What is this?

836
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:33,560
Security officer,

837
01:23:33,561 --> 01:23:40,183
report to baggage area
immediately.

838
01:23:40,184 --> 01:23:41,685
Jesus Christ, he's got a...

839
01:23:41,686 --> 01:23:42,819
Look out! Get out of the way!

840
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:43,687
Somebody call the police!

841
01:23:43,688 --> 01:23:45,439
Look out! He's got a gun!

842
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:46,940
Call the police!

843
01:23:46,941 --> 01:23:47,941
They're going up the ramp! Look out!

844
01:23:47,942 --> 01:23:49,443
Look out for that gun!

845
01:23:49,444 --> 01:23:51,244
Isn't there any
security officers around here?

846
01:24:38,910 --> 01:24:40,410
They came here an hour ago.

847
01:24:40,411 --> 01:24:44,915
Your friend
Diangelo. They killed hap.

848
01:24:44,916 --> 01:24:47,919
It's too late!
They took your boy away!

849
01:24:48,419 --> 01:24:50,921
There's nothing
you can do about it.

850
01:24:50,922 --> 01:24:52,923
Why in the hell
did you let it happen?

851
01:24:52,924 --> 01:24:54,925
They had guns.
I'm a man of god now.

852
01:24:54,926 --> 01:24:59,930
I don't use violence anymore.

853
01:24:59,931 --> 01:25:01,432
Where did Diangelo take him?

854
01:25:01,933 --> 01:25:02,934
I don't know.

855
01:25:03,434 --> 01:25:04,434
They said they'd call you,

856
01:25:04,435 --> 01:25:07,437
let you know what the deal was.

857
01:25:07,438 --> 01:25:09,940
I'll kill that honky bastard!

858
01:25:09,941 --> 01:25:11,943
That's all that matters?

859
01:25:12,443 --> 01:25:15,946
Tommy Gibbs
gets to have his sweet revenge.

860
01:25:15,947 --> 01:25:17,447
Well, I'm going
to call the police.

861
01:25:17,448 --> 01:25:20,951
You think they give a damn
if my kid comes back alive?

862
01:25:20,952 --> 01:25:25,455
Rufus, I love my son.

863
01:25:25,456 --> 01:25:27,958
I'll give Diangelo
whatever he wants.

864
01:25:28,459 --> 01:25:29,960
It's kidnapping, murder.

865
01:25:29,961 --> 01:25:31,462
They have to help us.

866
01:25:34,465 --> 01:25:35,466
Let me take it.

867
01:25:40,972 --> 01:25:42,973
Yes?

868
01:25:42,974 --> 01:25:45,475
Yes, Diangelo.

869
01:25:45,476 --> 01:25:46,977
I'm reverend Rufus Fairchild,

870
01:25:46,978 --> 01:25:48,979
acting as intermediary
on the matter.

871
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:51,481
What's he after?

872
01:25:51,482 --> 01:25:56,486
State your terms, Diangelo.

873
01:25:56,487 --> 01:25:59,489
They want your life.

874
01:25:59,490 --> 01:26:01,491
Yeah, well, I figured that.

875
01:26:01,492 --> 01:26:05,495
How do we know
Jason is all right?

876
01:26:05,496 --> 01:26:10,500
We want to see Jason first.

877
01:26:10,501 --> 01:26:13,503
Ok.

878
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,506
An hour.

879
01:26:19,010 --> 01:26:20,011
Hello?

880
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:32,522
There's no guarantee
they'll return Jason,

881
01:26:32,523 --> 01:26:34,024
even after they got you.

882
01:26:34,025 --> 01:26:36,026
If I don't come back,

883
01:26:36,027 --> 01:26:40,030
and they return Jason...

884
01:26:40,031 --> 01:26:41,151
Tell Jennifer to leave town,

885
01:26:41,532 --> 01:26:43,033
go someplace else,
change their names.

886
01:26:43,034 --> 01:26:44,535
Forget about me.

887
01:27:03,804 --> 01:27:05,305
Move.

888
01:27:14,315 --> 01:27:17,317
Where's my kid? Where is he?

889
01:27:17,318 --> 01:27:19,819
There are no niggers
in this neighborhood.

890
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:21,821
You don't really expect
to see him, do you?

891
01:27:21,822 --> 01:27:23,323
Is he all right?

892
01:27:23,324 --> 01:27:24,824
Diangelo's got him.

893
01:27:24,825 --> 01:27:28,328
He's the only one
with stomach enough to kill a kid.

894
01:27:28,829 --> 01:27:29,829
What do you want from me?

895
01:27:29,830 --> 01:27:31,331
Just you.

896
01:27:40,091 --> 01:27:41,091
You hear me up there?

897
01:27:41,092 --> 01:27:42,092
Yeah, I hear you.

898
01:27:42,093 --> 01:27:43,593
We can make a deal.

899
01:27:43,594 --> 01:27:44,844
Tommy Gibbs don't make deals.

900
01:27:44,845 --> 01:27:46,346
They're going to kill
your kid tonight.

901
01:27:46,347 --> 01:27:47,848
That's all I know.

902
01:27:53,854 --> 01:27:59,859
Rest in peace, brother.

903
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:02,362
Well, that's one sinner
that won't sin no more.

904
01:28:02,363 --> 01:28:04,364
Here. I'll take this.

905
01:28:04,365 --> 01:28:05,865
It's been a long time.

906
01:28:05,866 --> 01:28:07,867
Welcome back, brother.

907
01:28:07,868 --> 01:28:10,370
Well, I couldn't
very well let them kill you.

908
01:28:10,371 --> 01:28:11,871
Well, maybe you should have.

909
01:28:11,872 --> 01:28:14,374
Would have saved you
a lot of praying later on.

910
01:28:14,375 --> 01:28:16,376
I still got to save your soul.

911
01:28:16,377 --> 01:28:17,377
Yeah, that's true.

912
01:28:17,378 --> 01:28:23,933
Let's go see if he knows
where my son is.

913
01:28:23,934 --> 01:28:26,436
Mission of San Marco? San Marco?

914
01:28:26,437 --> 01:28:29,939
<i>That's just like
Diangelo to hide out in a church.</i>

915
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:32,442
<i>Well, you'll feel
right at home, Rufus.</i>

916
01:29:10,981 --> 01:29:12,983
Don't move, Rufus.

917
01:29:13,484 --> 01:29:15,985
Jason, don't move.

918
01:29:15,986 --> 01:29:18,605
Let the kid
alone, Diangelo. Let him walk away.

919
01:29:18,606 --> 01:29:20,857
You're the one to blame, Tommy.

920
01:29:20,858 --> 01:29:23,860
You should've stayed retired.

921
01:29:23,861 --> 01:29:25,361
Instead, you had
to come back into the business

922
01:29:25,362 --> 01:29:27,363
and bring
your whole family with you.

923
01:29:27,364 --> 01:29:28,865
Now, toss those guns away,

924
01:29:28,866 --> 01:29:32,252
or I'll kill
this boy, I swear I will.

925
01:29:56,894 --> 01:29:57,894
My life for his, Diangelo.

926
01:29:57,895 --> 01:30:00,897
All right, Tommy.

927
01:30:00,898 --> 01:30:02,899
You got a deal.

928
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:05,402
Fair trade.

929
01:30:35,316 --> 01:30:37,318
You know
what I'm going to do to you?

930
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:43,323
Figure it out, Diangelo.

931
01:30:43,824 --> 01:30:47,076
Figure it out.

932
01:30:47,077 --> 01:30:49,195
I'm going to send you
to wop heaven!

933
01:30:50,698 --> 01:30:52,699
I'm going to make you
famous, Diangelo!

934
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:55,703
You're going to be
the first whitey ever hung by a nigger!

935
01:31:51,392 --> 01:31:55,895
Jason?

936
01:31:55,896 --> 01:31:59,399
Jason!

937
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:00,401
Jason!

938
01:32:25,426 --> 01:32:27,927
We're going away, son...

939
01:32:27,928 --> 01:32:29,930
Just the two of us.

940
01:32:30,431 --> 01:32:34,434
We're going to start over
where nobody knows us,

941
01:32:34,435 --> 01:32:37,438
and I'm going to love you
just like I loved my pa.
