1
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,500
Look, dinner!

2
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,200
Don't drop it again!

3
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,240
Just watch, if you drop it, I'll drop you too.

4
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:29,480
Quick.

5
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,840
It's right ahead.

6
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,660
Right there, behind the door.

7
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:36,900
Why'd you put it-

8
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,360
I told you to be careful, that's expensive.

9
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,440
Why can't you get it?

10
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,600
It's so simple!

11
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,840
And you! You too, you're so clumsy

12
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,100
Sorry, ma'am.

13
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,920
Why do you keep dropping it?

14
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:47,660
It slipped.

15
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,660
Just go upstairs first.

16
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,700
You'll tire yourse-

17
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,920
I'm not tired, I'm asthmatic.

18
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,760
Why can't you-

19
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,380
It's fine, just go ahead. I'll just-

20
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,100
That's right, go first.

21
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,300
Ok Ok, just go.

22
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,680
Alright, there's more downstairs.

23
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
Here, let me help.

24
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,480
Wait, let me prop it up.

25
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:37,840
Where?

26
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,320
Ah, here. Here's fine.

27
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,600
You live here too?

28
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,660
Nico.

29
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,020
Sorry, my hands are dirty.

30
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,440
Jewel.

31
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,220
Kuya, let's put that there.

32
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,280
Ok, I'll go now.

33
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,720
Do I still need to prove myself?

34
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,840
Motherfucker.

35
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:31,860
Janine.

36
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,360
What else do you want me to do?

37
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,020
Hello?

38
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:39,980
Janine?

39
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,620
Fuck!

40
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,500
Are you okay?

41
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,200
You? Are you okay?

42
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,640
Yeah.

43
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,380
You don't eat the baby chick?

44
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,600
Nope.

45
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,100
Lemme have it.

46
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,300
What's it taste like?

47
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:51,760
Hm?

48
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,620
Chicken.

49
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,760
That's...

50
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,620
a bit slimy.

51
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,620
You know, frogs,

52
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,920
also taste like chicken.

53
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,300
Why is that,

54
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,100
everything tastes like chicken?

55
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,360
I bet you that people

56
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,680
also taste like chicken.

57
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,120
Really?

58
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,260
Well, you said...

59
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,480
that we taste like chicken.

60
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,320
I meant maybe. I've obviously never tried it.

61
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,060
I thought you might've.

62
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,280
Wanna try?

63
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,860
One shot?

64
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,020
Let's dance!

65
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,660
No, I'm okay.

66
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,960
Babe. Babe.

67
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,140
What are we doing?

68
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,540
Where?

69
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,500
Let's go out again.

70
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,820
Okay.

71
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,800
Oh, we're here.

72
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah.

73
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,700
What about Jewel?

74
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,480
I'll drive her. It's on the way anyways.

75
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,060
Is that so?

76
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,220
Then, I'll tag along.

77
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,320
It's still early, and I don't have work tommorow.

78
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,040
And I'll have to come back here?

79
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,380
Um. Ok. Just... text me when you get home?

80
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,320
Bye babe.

81
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,580
Night.

82
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,480
You're staying there?

83
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,480
Maybe you want to sit here?

84
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,980
I look like your Uber.

85
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,800
How long have you two been friends?

86
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,400
Are you two close?

87
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,280
Not really.

88
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,920
Amy's like that isn't she?

89
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,700
You know...

90
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,000
She never lets me meet her friends.

91
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,100
especially the pretty ones.

92
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,980
She probably thinks that I'm going to cheat on her.

93
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,280
What's wrong?

94
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,460
It's just a joke.

95
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,780
Relax.

96
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,080
Smile.

97
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,460
Get out.

98
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,780
Are you okay?

99
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,280
Ate, a bowl of beef mami.

100
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,220
Thanks.

101
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,540
You don't want anything?

102
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,960
I don't know what to order.

103
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,880
Try this. Try the beef mami.

104
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:31,720
Okay.

105
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,060
Ate, One beef mami please.

106
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,200
How long ago did you breakup?

107
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,580
A month ago.

108
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,600
One month?

109
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,020
That's hard.

110
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,320
Super hard.

111
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,160
Even more when you're dumped.

112
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,180
It hurts, no?

113
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,140
Like your heart is going to explode.

114
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,880
So you should just cry and cry because

115
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,360
you don't know what else to do.

116
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,340
Happened to you too?

117
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,160
What did?

118
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,200
Got dumped.

119
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,520
Ah, nope. I just saw it on TV.

120
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,140
Why?

121
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,760
Nothing.

122
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,080
It's cuz I've never had a boyfriend.

123
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:05,900
Really?

124
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:06,800
Mhmm.

125
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,060
You're probably picky.

126
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,160
Or maybe... your standards are too high.

127
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,440
I think,

128
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,140
that,

129
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,280
I don't have a boyfriend because no one loves me.

130
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,180
Because I'm a bad person.

131
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:40,880
Huh?

132
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't think so?

133
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,820
I am a bad person.

134
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,760
You just don't know it.

135
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,580
Really? Okay.

136
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,060
What's the worst thing you've done?

137
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,180
Too many to count.

138
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,840
Tell me.

139
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,100
You stole things?

140
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,180
Nope.

141
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,700
Oh wait, I know.

142
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,800
Talked back to your parents.

143
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,040
Wrong again.

144
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,660
Then what?

145
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,780
I've killed people.

146
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,120
Joke! Look at you. It's just a joke.

147
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,540
You almost had me.

148
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,040
There we go.

149
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,920
Have you met my turtle?

150
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,080
What's their name?

151
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,300
Edward.

152
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,180
Edward?

153
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,040
Why Edward?

154
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,640
No reason.

155
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,780
I just liked the name Edward.

156
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,780
Why did you choose Dumbledore?

157
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,700
Janine chose the name.

158
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,420
You know, Edward

159
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,720
he's like my best friend.

160
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,600
You two always hang out?

161
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,260
I talk to him when I'm sad.

162
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,420
We're similar then.

163
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:00,680
2 bodies were found yesterday at 4am on the intersection of New York and Annapolis street.

164
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,280
A sign saying "I'm a drug pusher, don't follow me" was found on one of the bodies.

165
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:10,160
The victims were indentified by their relatives, Miko Dominguez and Dominic Baez.

166
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,340
I know it deep down, Christine. You're the one I love.

167
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,540
I love you too, Gabriel.

168
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,380
But we can't be together.

169
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,620
Why not?

170
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,320
You don't know who I am.

171
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,540
There's a lot that you don't know about me.

172
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,720
I don't care.

173
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,680
You know that I'll accept you,

174
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,680
regardless of what you've done.

175
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,000
I love you.

176
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,640
That's all that matters.

177
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,860
We can't just rely on our love!

178
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,120
What are you saying?

179
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,620
I'm a bad person Gabriel.

180
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,380
Let's eat?

181
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,240
You first.

182
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,560
Then tell me who's the better cook.

183
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,520
Me or the lady at the stall.

184
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,380
Yes, ma'am.

185
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:00,900
Yours.

186
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,660
This tastes better.

187
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,600
I told you.

188
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,160
You'll never be able to go back.

189
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,380
Because my mami is the best.

190
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,980
You know, if you're wondering why,

191
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,780
my grandson's face is so unique-

192
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,620
Lola,

193
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,080
Don't-

194
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,480
No one said that.

195
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,700
Well maybe she's thinking it.

196
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,200
Should I just wait for her to ask?

197
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,540
No need to ask.

198
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,960
I'll just tell you why his face is so different.

199
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,840
It's because his grandfather is German.

200
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,420
-Here we go again.

201
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,920
His grandfather?

202
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,600
German.

203
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,100
He was German?

204
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,780
Are you doubting me?

205
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,780
No, it's not like that.

206
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,940
- Are you saying that that German didn't find me pretty?

207
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:41,640
Ah, no-

208
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,600
-You don't think that a German person would chase after me?

209
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,660
It's not like that-

210
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,480
I didn't look like a Goodwill yet.

211
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,740
I believe you.

212
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,560
You know, I remember it like yesterday

213
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,420
Henry Otto.

214
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,780
He told me:

215
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,240
I said, what?

216
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,600
What does it mean?

217
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,500
What? What was it again?

218
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,060
He said that. Heinrich told me that.

219
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,700
What's that?

220
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:26,120
It means "Trinidad, you're very beautiful."

221
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,140
Amazing.

222
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,080
She believes me.

223
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,080
It's convincing isn't it?

224
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,740
Obviously.

225
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,860
Hopefully one day you can say that to Jewel.

226
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,960
Because, of course,

227
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,080
she's much prettier than Janine.

228
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:51,880
Try it.

229
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,300
Try telling her that

230
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,480
Just try it once.

231
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,500
Okay practice.

232
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,320
Jewel

233
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,660
Jewel

234
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,200
What do you mean Malisongsong?

235
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,260
Now it sounds like Chinese.

236
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,260
What's that? Malisongsong?

237
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,280
No! What the heck?

238
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,520
Oh my.

239
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,380
Let's just eat the noodles before they get cold.

240
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,820
But it tastes good right? Yes ma'am.

241
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,920
You two should slurp.

242
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,400
Educated people slurp noodles.

243
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,320
Let me turn the TV on.

244
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,640
A man by the name of Marcos Dehada

245
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,900
was found dead today, at 6am, in Quezon City.

246
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,400
He was torn to pieces and his heart was missing

247
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:12,460
and he held a sign saying "I'm a drug lord."

248
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,100
The last time anyone saw the victim, he was insi-

249
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,100
Should we turn it off?

250
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,060
Leave it.

251
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,060
Leave it. We have to get used to it.

252
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,920
Let them kill each other.

253
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,340
Jewel, want more soup?

254
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,280
Yes, please.

255
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,960
The mother, Gina, is adamant that her son had nothing to do with the drug trade

256
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,700
and that this slander against her son was painful.

257
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:48,020
As for her family, they won't stop until they find justice, and they won't stop unti-

258
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,120
It's pretty isn't it?

259
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,260
It looks nice.

260
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:59,020
You know, my nails are so important to me.

261
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,080
I never forget to take care of them, even if it's hard

262
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,240
Even if I go hungry, I'll buy nail polish.

263
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:14,440
Like those aristocrats since their nails are always so nice.

264
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,820
They never forget their nails.

265
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,960
There. That's why,

266
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:24,080
you should take care of your nails too.

267
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,920
The shape of your nails are very pretty.

268
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,920
Yeah. Keep it that way huh?

269
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,340
Forever like that.

270
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,180
Poor Jewel, you're rambling about your Cutex again.

271
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,760
I was just complimenting her nails

272
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,660
Take this. It suits you, red.

273
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,260
I have a lot of these.

274
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,240
You're roping Jewel into your Cutex obsession.

275
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,860
Why? Are you trying to keep me to yourself?

276
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,760
Oh, look Jewel-

277
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,360
I'll try this.

278
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:53,920
It's pretty see

279
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,360
Ah, stop it.

280
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,540
You should slow down.

281
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,820
Let me enjoy life.

282
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,820
People need to enjoy life.

283
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,860
I can handle it.

284
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,220
Here take this.

285
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,960
Take it, I'm going to dance.

286
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:12,020
Go. go. go

287
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,320
Careful, careful.

288
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,280
The monsters always look younger no?

289
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,560
Because they're wearing makeup, ha!

290
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,560
Lola!

291
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,880
This costume is perfect for you.

292
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,180
It is, isn't it?

293
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,520
I went to France and bought this in '71 before Martial Law was declared!

294
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,800
Slow down.

295
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,000
Just watch, later-

296
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,800
No!

297
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,600
As long as I want to dance I'll-

298
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,820
C'mere, let's go there! I'll leave this to you.

299
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,060
Who're you? Tarzan?

300
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,520
Nope. Wait. Lemme vape.

301
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,260
Are you okay?

302
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,440
Kapre

303
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,620
A Filipino monster known for sitting in trees and smoking a cigar.

304
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,600
You're...

305
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,360
It's obvious.

306
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,080
Manananggal.

307
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,300
You know,

308
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,680
You're the prettiest manananggal I've ever met.

309
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,080
Jewel.

310
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,060
Jewel.

311
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,380
Can I borrow a light?

312
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,140
Thanks.

313
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,380
Good party?

314
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:40,580
Yeah.

315
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:44,920
Thank you.

316
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:09,400
Don't imitate me, I'm a drug pusher.

317
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:18,640
Jewel?

318
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,260
Jewel.

319
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:21,540
Nico.

320
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,000
Are you okay?

321
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,180
I'm fine. Why?

322
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,160
You never came back to

323
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:35,800
the Halloween party.

324
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,060
Sorry.

325
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,140
I got a stomachache.

326
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:43,580
Are you ok?

327
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,400
Do you need...

328
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:45,780
medicine?

329
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:46,980
No.

330
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,300
I'm okay, thanks.

331
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,140
See you. I'm going to sleep.

332
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:14,180
Another corpse was discovered in a back alley.

333
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,760
The victim was one Jaime Perez.

334
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:22,080
This murder follows a similar pattern to others this month.

335
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,480
His insides were ripped apart, and his heart was missing.

336
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:30,300
The victim was probably related to the drug war.

337
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:36,780
A sign saying, "Don't imitate me, I'm a drug pusher" was found on his body.

338
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:14,440
Jewel.

339
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,500
Did you know the man who was murdered recently?

340
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,540
Jaime Perez.

341
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:24,920
Jaime?

342
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,400
You don't know them?

343
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,540
No.

344
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,400
I thought that,

345
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,900
I saw you get in his car.

346
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,260
I don't think that was me.

347
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,580
I think it was.

348
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,440
It's just your imagination.

349
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,800
Jewel's been waiting for you.

350
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:55,700
Nico.

351
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:59,020
I wanted to show you

352
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,540
this bridge I bought for Dumbledore and Edward.

353
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,720
That, and this turtle,

354
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,340
This,

355
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:11,040
No fishing.

356
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,600
Can you leave for a bit?

357
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:16,740
I need to talk to Grandma

358
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,460
I already paid the electricity bill. It's fine.

359
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:30,120
I was just thinking-

360
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:30,980
C'mon. Go.

361
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:36,680
Okay.

362
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:39,480
W-w-w-

363
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:41,540
Jewel! Wait!

364
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,700
Hey, tell her sorry!

365
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:46,520
Dinnertime.

366
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:50,980
Lola

367
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:53,740
Let's eat.

368
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:00,660
Lola

369
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:02,720
Lola

370
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,380
Wake up!

371
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:05,800
Help!

372
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,460
Lola Lola

373
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:45,180
Nico.

374
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,220
You're late. Again.

375
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,280
Sorry, boss.

376
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,020
I have to take care of my grandmother.

377
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:55,980
Don't make excuses.

378
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,740
Fine. Just hurry up.

379
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:02,780
Boss.

380
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:06,880
Maybe,

381
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,240
I can get an advance?

382
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,440
I don't have enough money for my grandmother's

383
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,020
surgery, sir.

384
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,440
You want an advance?

385
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,600
When you don't have any clients?

386
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:21,180
I'll get them back.

387
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:22,860
Even if you don't pay me for a month.

388
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,200
I just really need the money.

389
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:27,900
Sorry. I can't help you.

390
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,300
Why are you here?

391
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:48,420
I heard what happened to Lola.

392
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:25,920
What's this?

393
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:50,760
Do you know,

394
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,000
red is actually her favorite color?

395
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,780
Will she ever wake up again?

396
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:21,740
Of course.

397
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:25,120
She's like you in a lot of ways.

398
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,200
Do you think that if we play music,

399
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:43,760
she'll hear it?

400
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:16,160
Let's dance?

401
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:25,680
How do we start again?

402
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,460
Like this.

403
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:38,820
Feet spread like that.

404
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:29,120
Jewel.

405
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,300
You had nothing to do with,

406
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:36,820
those murders, right?

407
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:15,160
Jewel.

408
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:17,920
Thank you.

409
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:48,060
Jewel.

410
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:49,920
Jewel.

411
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:52,820
Jewel.

412
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,060
Jewel!

413
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,760
Look, there!

414
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,840
Where? Where is it? We'll take care of it.

415
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,100
Out of the way.

416
