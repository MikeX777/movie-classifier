1
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,287
Cheers!

2
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,601
Excellent.

3
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,400
Let's drink until we drop.

4
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,333
Save something for your wife.

5
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:31,305
Are you kidding?

6
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,010
Alcohol revives me.

7
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,774
The later it gets, the hornier I get.

8
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:40,745
Another glass. A little sip.

9
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,753
Tell me, Jane...

10
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,589
What year are you in?

11
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:48,620
4th year.

12
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,023
A senior should know better.

13
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,698
What are you doing with Tun?

14
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,361
He's a hunk.

15
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,070
You keep saying that.

16
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,932
Making Jim ask for girl's numbers.

17
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:01,902
Then breaking their hearts.

18
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:05,474
Speaking of broken hearts...

19
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,077
Remember the time...

20
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,511
that girl left him a drunken mess.

21
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,817
Her name was Kay.

22
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,712
Ignore them.

23
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,781
Wait. I have a question.

24
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,956
How can a guy like you get married?

25
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,592
What's wrong with me?

26
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,855
After a long tiring day...

27
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,789
I want to head home...

28
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,431
to a wife's embrace or a pet's face.

29
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,103
Not waste my life...

30
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,730
partying with you losers.

31
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,600
Not with me.

32
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,601
A good man...

33
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,376
who went whoring with me last night.

34
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,609
Fooling around so soon?

35
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,280
Here she comes.

36
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:49,480
Quiet.

37
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,747
What's so funny?

38
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,481
Nothing.

39
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,190
One last thing...

40
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,829
One more glass!

41
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,181
What are we listening to?

42
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,681
Don't turn it off.

43
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,220
It's beautiful.

44
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,588
You guys seem tight.

45
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,420
Do you meet often?

46
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,326
What are you looking at?

47
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,500
Beautiful you.

48
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,100
What a sap.

49
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,683
Are you hurt?

50
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,681
Tun...

51
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,145
Is she dead?

52
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:39,863
Wait!

53
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,603
Drive away.

54
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:52,904
I said drive away!

55
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,512
Drive away!

56
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,488
Get closer, please.

57
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,061
Okay.

58
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,529
Big smile, Nuch.

59
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,628
Or you won't look pretty.

60
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,465
All Science Majors...

61
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,904
gather for a class photo.

62
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,640
They're calling you.

63
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,807
Where's Jane?

64
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,684
Taking photos with her friends.

65
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,982
I though maybe you broke up.

66
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,482
Come! Let's go.

67
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,740
I phoned but you didn't pick up.

68
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,276
Was it on silent?

69
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,920
Nuch asked about you today.

70
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,061
When will you be free?

71
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,200
She wants to...

72
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,784
Jane.

73
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,187
How can you act like this?

74
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,023
Pretending nothing happened.

75
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,328
Since that night...

76
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,163
I haven't slept soundly.

77
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,804
I'm upset as well.

78
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,212
At least we should have checked.

79
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:47,278
It was an accident.

80
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,215
That's easy for you to say.

81
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,453
You weren't behind the wheel.

82
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,095
- Hi, Ti.
- Hey.

83
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,403
How's business?

84
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,677
With you here this early...

85
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,978
business should be bad.

86
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,512
Are my prints ready?

87
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,180
Yeah. Just a sec.

88
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,149
Here.

89
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,745
Is your processor broken?

90
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,377
Let's see.

91
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,452
The nerve.

92
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,024
Nice prints and you're great.

93
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,661
If they suck, it's my fault.

94
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,429
Let's check the negative.

95
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,627
No way.

96
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,164
I took them. I should know.

97
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,494
We'll see.

98
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:13,964
See.

99
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,935
Your negative are bad.

100
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,259
Tun.

101
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,909
Tun.

102
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,892
Tun.

103
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,331
Can you hear me?

104
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,420
Help!

105
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,050
Help!

106
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:57,161
Don't be scared. I'm here now.

107
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,247
What's wrong with your camera?

108
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,552
I don't' know.

109
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,277
The whole roll is ruined.

110
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,619
That many?

111
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,889
What are these shadows?

112
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,595
My camera must be broken.

113
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,400
How should I tell Nuch?

114
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,640
Tun...

115
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,511
Look at this picture.

116
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:00,818
That woman...

117
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,292
Do you think she's dead?

118
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,087
That's enough.

119
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,700
I'll have my camera fixed tomorrow.

120
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:15,930
Tun...

121
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,466
Look at this picture.

122
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,851
Are you sure it was here?

123
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,000
Excuse me.

124
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,170
What happened?

125
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:56,005
A few days ago a car hit the billboard.

126
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,670
Must have been drunk.

127
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,646
Was anyone hurt?

128
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,773
No.

129
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,647
Just the broken sign.

130
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:07,181
Are you sure?

131
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,283
What?

132
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,313
Nothing.

133
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,818
Thank you.

134
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:16,886
What?

135
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,191
You sure you checked everywhere?

136
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:26,000
Nothing.

137
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:27,900
Thanks anyways.

138
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,178
He called every precinct and hospital.

139
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,218
No accidents were reported that night.

140
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,018
That's not possible.

141
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,951
What about the girl we hit?

142
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,855
You sure he called every one?

143
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,891
Maybe someone helped her.

144
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,328
Maybe she's fine.

145
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,964
How could she be fine?

146
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,963
We ploughed her down.

147
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,633
And even if she's fine...

148
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,903
Something is in those pictures.

149
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,005
I told you they're not related to her.

150
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,640
They're just bad exposures.

151
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,281
Get it?

152
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,735
Tun...

153
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,005
You need to make some merit.

154
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,642
These pictures...

155
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,212
show that a spirit is haunting you.

156
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,892
How long have you been a photographer?

157
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,722
Why are you showing me these?

158
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:32,962
I know...

159
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,592
But don't you find these shadows strange?

160
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:39,400
You want to see spirits?

161
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,633
I'll show you some.

162
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,343
Here.

163
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,175
Auntie Cham's spirit.

164
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,482
You know where she is now?

165
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,253
She's selling grilled bananas next door.

166
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,291
Here's Auntie Cham. And here.

167
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,087
All Auntie Cham.

168
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,825
Taken on the same day.

169
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,359
They're just double exposures...

170
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,067
and out of focus.

171
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,801
Come on. I know that.

172
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,207
Everyone is familiar with this place.

173
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,015
Just an ordinary location...

174
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,980
that we pass...

175
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,080
and see everyday.

176
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,495
Now look at these pictures...

177
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:47,201
taken of the same place.

178
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,302
In these...

179
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,000
the bridge looks nicer.

180
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,474
That means photography...

181
00:21:55,914 --> 00:22:00,180
does not reproduce reality.

182
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,818
It depends on how...

183
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,417
the image is framed.

184
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:09,516
What is revealed.

185
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,522
What is concealed.

186
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,325
Your perspective is critical.

187
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:30,205
"Special Scoop: Spirit Pictures"

188
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,093
Jane, you're early.

189
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,793
I'll get it.

190
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,465
- Hello?
- Hello, Tun.

191
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,674
It's Jane. I'll come by later.

192
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,804
Hello?

193
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,103
Tun, can you hear me?

194
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:02,574
Hello?

195
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,043
Tun!

196
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,544
Tun!

197
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:07,342
Hello?

198
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,076
Hello?

199
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,710
What's wrong?

200
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:39,484
I don't' know.

201
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,652
My neck's hurt since the accident.

202
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,382
You should go see a doctor.

203
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,553
I'm sure it's not serious.

204
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:52,623
What's the use of talking to these spoofs?

205
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,790
"Real Ghosts"

206
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,703
Are you a reporter?

207
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:01,996
No.

208
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,542
The funeral foundation sent us.

209
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,974
We run a legal operation.

210
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,045
We have all the right permits.

211
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,589
Excuse me.

212
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:03,330
Are all these pictures fakes?

213
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,302
Piak! Tell the boss he has guests.

214
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,472
Everyone fakes them.

215
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,002
You know...

216
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,144
these photos are always a hit.

217
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,306
Any issue with them sells out.

218
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:21,352
But you think...

219
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,481
we can always find real ones?

220
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,918
Isn't that deceiving the public?

221
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,022
Our readers...

222
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,654
want to see scary photos.

223
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,558
They don't want loves stories.

224
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:41,704
Does that mean every photo is fake?

225
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,640
I didn't say that.

226
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,317
Take a look.

227
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:03,693
See anything?

228
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,627
This is the first photo I had.

229
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,231
I took it at home.

230
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,230
The shadow...

231
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,972
bears a likeness to my mom.

232
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,005
Believe what you will.

233
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,205
But this picture...

234
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:26,848
was taken after she passed away.

235
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,252
You know...

236
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:31,511
sometimes...

237
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,157
spirits long for their loved ones.

238
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:41,763
In my opinion...

239
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,931
these pictures...

240
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,570
represent more than...

241
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,173
macabre urban legends.

242
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:53,604
They are signs.

243
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,513
Think about it.

244
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,309
Why would the dead...

245
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,680
return to the living...

246
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,926
Without a message to convey?

247
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:16,598
Most importantly...

248
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:18,901
I believe...

249
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,404
these shadows...

250
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,608
are related to someone in the picture.

251
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,142
A father...

252
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:31,573
mother...

253
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,214
or lover.

254
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,582
Or someone...

255
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,779
you maligned in life.

256
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:04,408
How can we tell if they're real...

257
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:05,947
and not fakes?

258
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:07,750
What about Polaroid's?

259
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,351
Can you fake them?

260
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:17,160
You load the film and press the shutter.

261
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:18,892
The photo ejects.

262
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,376
Tell me then...

263
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,084
How can they be faked?

264
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:47,617
How do we know what they want?

265
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,215
Perhaps...

266
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,325
the answer is in the photo.

267
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:03,671
Two more poses.

268
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:05,975
Big smiles.

269
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:12,374
Let's have a different pose.

270
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,918
Embrace her, hold the bouquet...

271
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,146
and kiss her cheek.

272
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,583
Beautiful.

273
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,026
We're done.

274
00:29:25,396 --> 00:29:27,762
Thank you both.

275
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,394
Take them to the dressing room.

276
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,058
What the...

277
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,125
Who's doing that?

278
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,131
Aum, check the fuse!

279
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,434
Hey! Aum!

280
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:09,403
Aum!

281
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:11,801
Who's doing that?

282
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,045
Is it you, Aum?

283
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,479
Who is it?

284
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,646
Aum, where are you?

285
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,160
Who's there!

286
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,091
I asked who it is!

287
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,763
Where are you, Aum?

288
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,410
Who's there!

289
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:39,254
Please step off the scale.

290
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,426
Step on it again.

291
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,870
Been working hard lately?

292
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,602
Not really.

293
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,680
How long has it hurt?

294
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,481
For quite awhile.

295
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,550
But it's gotten worse lately.

296
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,182
I had a car accident.

297
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,052
An accident?

298
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,557
Physically, you're fine.

299
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,059
You shouldn't worry.

300
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:15,488
But it really hurts.

301
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,862
Your x-rays are normal.

302
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:20,727
It may be a sprain.

303
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,131
Try the medicine I prescribed.

304
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,501
Mr. Tun, please pick up your prescription.

305
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:31,709
Take this medicine...

306
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,347
3 times a day after meals...

307
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,849
until the prescription runs out.

308
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,084
Lying bastard.

309
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,088
Pardon?

310
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,351
Yes?

311
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,186
Nothing.

312
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,496
Lying bastard.

313
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,502
Lying bastard.

314
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,108
As for this medicine...

315
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:00,703
Sir!

316
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:02,810
What's wrong?

317
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,375
...is rarely seen.

318
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:10,319
When grasshoppers begin mating...

319
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,757
the male smells the female...

320
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,154
from a distance up to 100 meters.

321
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:22,558
The male carefully approaches the female.

322
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,394
It hooks itself onto her belly.

323
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,902
And they begin to mate.

324
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:34,205
The female's response is surprising.

325
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,747
The male becomes her prey.

326
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:43,013
She slowly eats off his head...

327
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,148
while they are mating.

328
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,048
Eventually...

329
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,421
the male succumbs to death.

330
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:03,403
Excuse me, where is Room 301?

331
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:10,645
Jane.

332
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:16,118
Jane.

333
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,825
Jane.

334
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,860
Who's there?

335
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,656
Tonn...

336
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:08,930
What's wrong?

337
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,470
Tun...

338
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,104
I'm going to die.

339
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,933
What's going on?

340
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:18,700
The photos...

341
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:21,744
Bring me those photos.

342
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,007
What photos?

343
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,306
Are you drunk?

344
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,315
Those photos...

345
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:30,277
Where did you hide them?

346
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,818
Give them to me.

347
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,957
Remember that bitch.

348
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,215
Calm down.

349
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,191
What photos?

350
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,023
Just give them to me!

351
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,093
Please calm down.

352
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,700
Tonn, calm down.

353
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:46,902
What photos?

354
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,203
Tonn.

355
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:54,844
I'll call your wife.

356
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:38,916
What are you doing?

357
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,982
Cleaning up.

358
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:49,498
Your neck still sore?

359
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:52,662
Yeah.

360
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,962
Take it easy. Don't work so much.

361
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,906
"Natrenapa Chan-ngam, Honor Society 1995"

362
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,450
Tonn.

363
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,782
It's Tun.

364
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,862
Are you home?

365
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,102
Tonn.

366
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,904
Are you home?

367
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:14,884
Tonn.

368
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:40,811
"Natrenapa Chan-ngam"

369
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:29,421
Tonn!

370
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:31,226
Tonn!

371
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:34,263
Tonn!

372
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:42,701
Tonn!

373
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,979
I'm really sorry.

374
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,514
Do you know...

375
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,221
What was bothering him?

376
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:30,617
No. Suddenly he...

377
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:33,058
It's your gang's fault.

378
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,128
Have you all gone insane?

379
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,027
What do you mean?

380
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,173
You've all committed suicide.

381
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:45,634
Who?

382
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:48,477
Don't you know?

383
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:50,613
The other two...

384
00:45:51,014 --> 00:45:53,039
also killed themselves.

385
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:54,979
Which two?

386
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:02,055
The two who sat next to you.

387
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,803
Who's this woman?

388
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:53,575
Where did you get that?

389
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,904
She's the shadow in the photos, right?

390
00:46:58,549 --> 00:46:59,709
Who is she?

391
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:04,587
How is she related to you?

392
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,908
I knew her in college.

393
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,501
Her name is Natre.

394
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,074
She was a quiet person...

395
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,185
without any friends.

396
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:44,191
We all thought she was weird.

397
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,958
I felt sorry for her.

398
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,403
We dated but I kept it secret.

399
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:05,312
She loved me a lot.

400
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:58,181
She threatened to slit her wrists.

401
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,617
I didn't know what to do.

402
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:03,887
My friends thought it was funny.

403
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,918
How were they involved?

404
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:07,760
Why are they dead?

405
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:09,491
They...

406
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:10,757
What did they do?

407
00:51:13,203 --> 00:51:14,431
I don't know.

408
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:18,172
Tonn said he'd take care of it.

409
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:23,807
After that, Natre disappeared.

410
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:27,674
I never saw her again.

411
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:30,778
Didn't you try to stop them?

412
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:35,551
How could you let it happen?

413
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,589
What could I do?

414
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:47,629
Now everyone is dead.

415
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:52,402
I'm...

416
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:54,900
I'm going to die next.

417
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,947
It's funny how...

418
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,187
we always say...

419
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:41,886
if we could turn back time...

420
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,592
we...

421
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,796
we would reverse all our wrongs.

422
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,827
Do you think she's okay?

423
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,635
Will she be there?

424
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:56,163
Go to sleep.

425
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:00,265
I'll keep you company tonight.

426
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:06,061
Excuse me.

427
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,803
Do you have any toilet paper?

428
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:45,206
Can I poo first?

429
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:46,807
I'm sorry.

430
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:57,173
What's bothering you?

431
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,585
Tun. What's wrong?

432
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:26,072
What is it?

433
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,989
Is it around here?

434
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:31,203
Excuse me.

435
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:33,070
Do you know where this is?

436
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,380
Mom, where is this house?

437
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:14,611
Ma'am.

438
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,222
Excuse me...

439
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:29,863
Is this Natre's house?

440
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:32,994
What do you want?

441
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:35,328
Well...

442
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:37,866
We're her friends.

443
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,832
Natre's friends? Come inside.

444
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,389
Have some water. You must be tired.

445
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:56,316
Did you drive from Bangkok?

446
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:58,551
Yes.

447
01:00:01,664 --> 01:00:05,691
We'd like to ask about Natre.

448
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:08,397
She's not feeling well.

449
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:10,102
She's taking a nap.

450
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,007
Should I wake her?

451
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,972
Stay for dinner.

452
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:21,077
I was about to cook.

453
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,650
I'm making her favourite dish.

454
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:26,913
Natre will be so happy.

455
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,254
Her friends don't visit often.

456
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,258
Wait right here.

457
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:51,475
Where are you going?

458
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:07,419
How dare you?

459
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:15,431
Did she commit suicide?

460
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:22,496
We should cremate her.

461
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,407
No.

462
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:26,973
I won't cremate her.

463
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,401
Ma'am...

464
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:34,915
I don't know if you believe such things...

465
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:38,751
but I'd like you to look at these photos.

466
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:42,888
They were taken around campus.

467
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:47,526
Some of the places...

468
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:51,198
were rooms Natre had been in.

469
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:55,970
And these shadows appeared

470
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:00,770
I think that...

471
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:05,105
Natre's spirit is restless.

472
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:07,810
Natre...

473
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,921
My dear Natre.

474
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:17,024
Why don't you visit me?

475
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,901
Can you tell me what happened?

476
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,466
Why she left Bangkok?

477
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:40,243
Ma'am...

478
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:43,645
Ma'am.

479
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:46,648
These shadows...

480
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:50,556
might mean her spirit is not at peace.

481
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:57,092
We should hold her funeral.

482
01:03:58,634 --> 01:03:59,965
Please.

483
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,378
When she came home...

484
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:17,018
she seemed different.

485
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:19,149
She wouldn't talk to anyone.

486
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:21,713
No one knows what happened in Bangkok.

487
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,854
Then she overdosed on pills.

488
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:28,962
Luckily, her mother found her...

489
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:31,197
and got her to the hospital on time.

490
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,965
When she recovered...

491
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:38,171
she climbed on the hospital roof...

492
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:40,332
and jumped off the edge.

493
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:45,275
Why wouldn't her mom cremate her?

494
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:50,614
She's been distraught
ever since Natre's death.

495
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:55,017
No matter what she refused to cremate her.

496
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:58,554
All the villagers were scared.

497
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:01,726
No one wanted to socialize with her.

498
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:05,681
Can't sleep?

499
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:13,553
Tell me the truth...

500
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,191
Did you love Natre?

501
01:07:20,002 --> 01:07:21,731
I tried to...

502
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,501
I believed that one day I would.

503
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:38,152
But I was fooling myself.

504
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:47,595
When I broke it off...

505
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:51,265
I was a total asshole.

506
01:07:57,273 --> 01:07:59,207
But she still loved me the same.

507
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:07,612
I want this to be over.

508
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:12,119
If she wants me to die I will.

509
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:14,850
Don't say that.

510
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:17,450
It's almost over.

511
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:19,954
No it's not.

512
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:27,398
I know she'll come for me.

513
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:29,362
Tun.

514
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:31,933
We've come this far.

515
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:36,244
And you're sorry for what you did.

516
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:38,771
I'm sure she knows.

517
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,777
Don't talk about death anymore.

518
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:51,291
I'm sorry.

519
01:08:56,932 --> 01:08:58,695
Do you still love me?

520
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,473
No matter what you won't leave me, right?

521
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:48,700
Jane.

522
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:23,101
Tun...

523
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:24,461
Jane...

524
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:26,497
Where did you go?

525
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,300
Why did you leave me alone?

526
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:31,304
We've got to leave.

527
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,316
Asshole!

528
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:39,020
Why did you leave me?

529
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:40,916
Didn't you love me?

530
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,654
How could you leave me?

531
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:47,593
How could you leave me?

532
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:28,123
Tun...

533
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:30,055
Are you feeling better?

534
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:34,592
What happened last night?

535
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:37,129
Tun...

536
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:39,774
Jane...

537
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,101
Jane...

538
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,182
The abbot said...

539
01:14:49,384 --> 01:14:51,352
Natre will be cremated today.

540
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,548
It's over.

541
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:53,999
- Hello.
- Hello, Jane.

542
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,634
Picking up photos?

543
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,343
Where's Tun?

544
01:16:57,546 --> 01:16:58,774
He's busy.

545
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:00,339
Good.

546
01:17:00,549 --> 01:17:01,379
When he's busy...

547
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:03,050
I get to see you.

548
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:12,490
You went on vacation?

549
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:14,386
To the beach.

550
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,056
When did you go?

551
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:18,289
Last week.

552
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,627
This photo is...

553
01:17:26,141 --> 01:17:27,301
What's wrong?

554
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:34,710
You look fatter.

555
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:38,484
I didn't recognize you.

556
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:41,956
Hi.

557
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,152
Jumbo prints.

558
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:47,089
Write you name, please.

559
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:27,817
Get her guys!

560
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:04,583
Jane...

561
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:06,722
Why are you crying?

562
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:10,723
Asshole...

563
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:15,303
How could you be so cruel?

564
01:21:20,942 --> 01:21:22,375
Where did you find these?

565
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,572
If I didn't find them...

566
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:29,011
I'd be a fool forever, right?

567
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:36,113
Let me explain.

568
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:41,056
What's there to say?

569
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:46,992
I always believed you.

570
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:56,043
I thought I knew you.

571
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:11,083
Tun.

572
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:13,453
Take her picture...

573
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:14,922
so she doesn't blab.

574
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:17,121
Tun, help me.

575
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,960
I know it was wrong.

576
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,400
Take her picture now!

577
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:25,698
What's wrong!

578
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:28,709
I'm your buddy!

579
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:30,234
Hurry!

580
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,751
Tun, help me.

581
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:55,499
I never forgave myself.

582
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:57,672
But I was young and stupid.

583
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:00,605
I've heard enough.

584
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:04,201
I'm going home.

585
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:00,431
Come on out!

586
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:06,605
Where are you?

587
01:24:13,148 --> 01:24:14,775
I thought you loved me!

588
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:18,813
Loved me so much!

589
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:28,489
Till death do us part!

590
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:35,228
She's gone now.

591
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:15,730
Sometimes...

592
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:18,302
spirits long for their loved ones.
