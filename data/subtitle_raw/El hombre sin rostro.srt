1
00:01:11,716 --> 00:01:15,649
Yes, those are his victims.

2
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,529
All of them died under
his cruel claws.

3
00:01:21,544 --> 00:01:25,885
And many more will be added
to the funeral procession,

4
00:01:26,156 --> 00:01:29,253
if you don't stop that
insatiable  murderer.

5
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:34,254
These coffins oppress your heart,
Juan Carlos,

6
00:01:34,555 --> 00:01:37,879
as if it were your duty
to carry all of them...

7
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,375
with what little strength you have.

8
00:01:41,089 --> 00:01:45,617
So be it, then, until you discover
the murderer...

9
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:48,112
and annihilate him!

10
00:01:48,147 --> 00:01:52,054
Rest not, Juan Carlos,
rest not.

11
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:54,927
Search for him in the world,

12
00:01:55,488 --> 00:02:00,850
find him and kill him
with your bare hands!

13
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:03,749
Behold!

14
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:10,630
The time has come!
There's the murderer!

15
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:19,724
He's in your hands!
Kill him!

16
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:41,015
Finally, you'll see his face.

17
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,107
What's his face look like,
how's the look in his eyes?

18
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:56,306
Oh, poor boy.
You'll never see that face.

19
00:02:56,717 --> 00:03:03,392
You'll never break,
because the murderer has no face.

20
00:03:03,427 --> 00:03:06,574
He doesn't even have
the face of death.

21
00:03:07,357 --> 00:03:12,780
He is nothing but
a faceless man.

22

24
00:04:56,238 --> 00:05:00,570
Oh Lord, please have
mercy on us,

25
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:05,467
those who carry death
in our very own souls.

26
00:05:05,502 --> 00:05:10,743
Those who didn't know how to chain
the bloodthirsty beast that dwells in our hearts.

27
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:17,703
Those who released the monster
who ended up tearing us apart from the inside.

28
00:05:17,738 --> 00:05:20,371
Have mercy, oh Lord.

29
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:23,309
Have mercy on us.

30
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,744
Hey, my friend!
where are you headed for in such a hurry?

31
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:01,863
Do you want to die, or kill someone?

32
00:06:01,898 --> 00:06:04,225
- Did you hear me?
- No.

33
00:06:04,556 --> 00:06:08,697
- Papers, please.
- Uh?
- Documents, please.

34
00:06:14,528 --> 00:06:20,322
- Oh, you're Doctor Britel,
from the police?

35
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:23,404
Sorry to have stopped you, doctor;
Please moderate your speed.

36
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,004
Drive safe.

37
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:30,479
- Are you sick?
- No. I'm fine.

38
00:09:10,543 --> 00:09:16,684
I'm a murderer, I've killed,
and remorse overwhelms me.

39
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:22,207
I must write a confession to
avoid choking in anguish.

40
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:26,714
This is the most terrible punishment,
but my crime has an explanation.

41
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:29,058
I must tell all, in order to be understood.

42
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:32,799
Everything! I must start with the
events of that tragic night,

43
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:35,738
back last December.

44
00:11:30,173 --> 00:11:36,660
" Another crime by the mysterious
murderer of women "

45
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:45,560
No doubt, this is the same murderer.

46
00:11:45,595 --> 00:11:50,152
Yeah, same method of operation
and the same ruthless brutality.

47
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:53,217
Has maimed the body
just like the other ones.

48
00:11:53,252 --> 00:11:59,721
The work of a beast,
but with surgical precision.

49
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:04,218
And the same for our inability
to stop that filthy monster.

50
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:08,890
What kind of idiots are we,
what kind of incompetent is the commissioner?

51
00:12:08,925 --> 00:12:11,898
- This isn't an easy case.
- Those aren't experts, they're useless!

52
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:18,370
Come with me doctor,
those useless people should listen to us!

53
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,939
Find that idiot Lozano
as soon as possible!

54
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:33,945
I want to talk to him right now!

55
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,106
Dumb ass!
Stupid!

56
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:38,505
You're a bit harsh with Juan Carlos.

57
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,263
Harsh? For how many months
has he led this investigation?

58
00:12:43,298 --> 00:12:45,301
Where are the results?

59
00:12:45,336 --> 00:12:49,223
In the mass graves, where the mutilated
bodies of these women are rotting!

60
00:12:49,258 --> 00:12:54,965
Juan Carlos is a great officer,
and has resolved very complicated cases.

61
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,082
- When he was working!
- You know, he had a lot of trouble
with this case.

62
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:00,995
So, what's wrong with him?

63
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:06,135
You know he's clueless,
banging away at emptiness,

64
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,240
even though he used to solve
the most difficult crimes.

65
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:16,733
He must take into account many factors;
as to whether or not there was a prior relationship with the victim,

66
00:13:16,768 --> 00:13:21,511
and once he finds the right track,
that will lead him to the truth.

67
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:25,458
- Yeah, but...
- In this case, the murderer
didn't know the victims.

68
00:13:25,493 --> 00:13:29,419
This savage kills any woman
who crosses his path.

69
00:13:29,454 --> 00:13:33,592
- He must have a reason.
- Yeah, a reason within himself.

70
00:13:33,627 --> 00:13:35,925
His only reason seems to
be that they're women,

71
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,095
ugly, beautiful, young or old,
no matter, just women.

72
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,132
Certainly this a monstrous
indulgence of instinct,

73
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:48,473
and it's clear the investigator
isn't a psychic.

74
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:49,715
Go on!

75
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:05,317
- Hello.
- Hi, Juan Carlos.

76
00:14:05,352 --> 00:14:07,924
- Good morning, Chief.
- Lozano, my friend,

77
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:10,148
I want to warmly congratulate you...

78
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,789
Cut the irony and
tell me clearly what you want.

79
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:14,750
- You should already have an idea.
- Naturally.

80
00:14:14,785 --> 00:14:18,590
"Naturally"? Is that all you can say?
Nothing more about your utter failure?

81
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:22,804
No, but it crossed my mind that
you'd accept my resignation.

82
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:24,940
- Your resignation?
- Yes.

83
00:14:24,975 --> 00:14:28,412
Even if you hadn't called me here,
I would have resigned anyway.

84
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:30,873
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute, Lozano!

85
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:34,354
- What do you want?
- I have four things to say.

86
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:37,012
- Go ahead, I deserve it.
- Sure you do!

87
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:41,146
The problem is not your inefficiency,
but your cowardice!

88
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:45,052
I've failed.
I have totally failed!

89
00:14:45,603 --> 00:14:47,050
On this matter!

90
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:50,416
Precisely, the very case I asked about furiously!

91
00:14:50,777 --> 00:14:54,560
This case was my pride,
even my conscience.

92
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:56,877
Look Lozano, this is no
time to flinch!

93
00:14:57,148 --> 00:15:01,410
I know the case is difficult,
but you've solved greater mysteries.

94
00:15:01,445 --> 00:15:03,783
I can't! Don't you
see that I can't!

95
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:05,550
Take it easy, Juan Carlos.
Take it easy.

96
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:09,203
Obstacles shoulf be our greatest
encouragement!

97
00:15:09,762 --> 00:15:14,758
You need a drink,
and think things over.

98
00:15:14,793 --> 00:15:17,828
No, what I need...
I just don't know.

99
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:23,679
Let's think about this issue over
a whiskey, you'll see.

100
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:28,624
It's useless, Eugenio,
please don't insist.

101
00:15:29,045 --> 00:15:31,500
I can't go on with the case.

102
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:35,877
Didn't you say that your
conscience is at stake?

103
00:15:36,116 --> 00:15:37,999
You know it is.

104
00:15:38,034 --> 00:15:42,110
- So?
- I don't know.

105
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,541
I don't know what's wrong
with me.

106
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:49,713
It's possible my own anxiety
is interfering with my abilities.

107
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:56,698
Also there may be something more serious.

108
00:15:56,733 --> 00:15:58,881
Something more serious?

109
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,975
Like what, Juan Carlos?

110
00:16:02,366 --> 00:16:04,661
I don't know...

111
00:16:05,242 --> 00:16:10,565
Look, this sounds foolish,
but I'm almost certain...

112
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,053
that I'm the reason
the murderer...

113
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:18,672
mutilates his victims, he
actually wants to break me!

114
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:22,074
Break you?

115
00:16:22,109 --> 00:16:24,276
How come?

116
00:16:24,311 --> 00:16:27,538
Maybe by leading me to make errors.
From failure to failure.

117
00:16:28,158 --> 00:16:31,464
No, Eugenio! I don't
want to fail again!

118
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:39,417
- I'm sick of my failures.
- Yeah, you just pointed out the problem!

119
00:16:39,768 --> 00:16:42,197
- Why?
- You're suffering, not because of
your failing,

120
00:16:42,232 --> 00:16:48,033
yeah, not because of your failing,
but by your fear of failure.

121
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:50,955
You've always had a
pathological fear of failure.

122
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,279
No, you're wrong.

123
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:56,790
Then why did you leave your surgical career, just when
you were about to become a doctor with honors?

124
00:16:56,825 --> 00:17:00,571
- That wasn't my way!
- And why did you abandon so
many other things!?

125
00:17:00,973 --> 00:17:05,197
So you became a police officer,
and now you want to give up yet again.

126
00:17:05,996 --> 00:17:08,054
Do you really want to know?

127
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:11,141
Because I'm useless!
Do you hear me?!

128
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,409
I'm good for absolutely nothing!

129
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:21,070
Stop being a coward, Juan Carlos.

130
00:17:21,105 --> 00:17:26,065
If you want to heal your soul,
confront your fears with courage,

131
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,342
and don't turn your back
on responsibility.

132
00:17:28,377 --> 00:17:31,557
- What do you mean?
- Act like a man. Finish your work!

133
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,357
I can't.
I tell you, I can't!

134
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:35,677
Why not?

135
00:17:37,842 --> 00:17:41,633
Would you feel less of a loser
if you quit?

136
00:17:42,345 --> 00:17:43,388
You see?

137
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:52,901
If you give up your duty, each new victim
of that sadist will weigh on your conscience.

138
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:55,642
And your confusion will increase!

139
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:03,197
Don't hesitate; it's not
the triumph that'll set you free,

140
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,405
but to stay in the game until the end.

141
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:08,657
And if by the end,
you're defeated,

142
00:18:09,118 --> 00:18:12,152
at least attain peace within yourself.

143
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:14,067
Don't you see?

144
00:18:14,102 --> 00:18:15,885
Maybe you're right.

145
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,111
- Just "maybe"?
- No! You're right!

146
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:23,652
It's true; the murderer
can't escape so easily!

147
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:24,700
Sure.

148
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:29,643
It must be I who catches him
and puts him in the hands of the law.

149
00:18:29,678 --> 00:18:32,892
And if I have a chance,
I'll kill him like a mad dog,

150
00:18:32,927 --> 00:18:35,196
as viciously as he's
done to his victims!

151
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:37,267
Self-control,
self-control.

152
00:18:37,302 --> 00:18:40,033
Don't be discouraged as you were before,
or reckless as you are now.

153
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:43,454
I'd rather see you as well,
don't give up!

154
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:48,733
- Don't give up.
- I won't! On the contrary,
I'll be more cunning!

155
00:18:48,768 --> 00:18:50,352
That's the spirit!

156
00:18:50,387 --> 00:18:55,467
I'll take the first step now.
I guarantee you that I'll succeed!

157
00:19:03,178 --> 00:19:09,500
Every day the lousy life of 
this loser becomes more interesting.

158
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:12,075
If he manages to get to where I think,

159
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:16,239
he may resist the terrible test,

160
00:19:16,777 --> 00:19:20,906
and let us see how he reacts
to the next murder.

161
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,620
Another victim, Eugenio.

162
00:20:17,344 --> 00:20:19,939
Yes, another one.

163
00:20:19,974 --> 00:20:22,120
That devil is laughing at me
and all of us!

164
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,006
He's as cunning as a beast.

165
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:28,606
His instinct is cunning and bestial.

166
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:33,890
- These crimes are instinctive.
- Disgusting is what they are!

167
00:20:36,678 --> 00:20:39,902
You don't know how I despise myself
for not being able to stop this.

168
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:44,408
You know for an investigation like this,
you must have a bulletproof patience.

169
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:48,089
Yeah, and lose one's dignity.

170
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,303
- One should be lowered to
snooping in landfills!
- Why?

171
00:20:53,338 --> 00:20:56,867
- Do you have any clue?
- None.

172
00:20:56,902 --> 00:20:59,096
What else can I do?

173
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,929
It's not just a lunatic who kills for
some (sexual) impulse.

174
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,625
For some (sexual) impulse.

175
00:21:07,853 --> 00:21:11,573
- It could be.
- It might be!

176
00:21:12,174 --> 00:21:16,192
Well, we must go to where
criminals gather...

177
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:19,833
and wait for a telltale word,

178
00:21:20,073 --> 00:21:23,346
a gesture, anything that would
betray the murderer.

179
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:25,151
That sounds like an exciting endeavor.

180
00:21:25,186 --> 00:21:28,280
For me it's exciting.

181
00:21:28,315 --> 00:21:31,339
I've always been fascinated by
the depths of the human soul.

182
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,126
I should go with you sometime.

183
00:21:36,673 --> 00:21:40,345
Want to make sure I'm not doubting myself,
and doing my duty?

184
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,925
- Not for that reason.
- You can come anytime.
- How about tonight?

185
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:48,076
Okay. Tonight.

186
00:21:48,111 --> 00:21:51,474
- Where will we go?
- You'll find out.

187
00:23:29,267 --> 00:23:31,012
Is everything ready?

188
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:36,004
We must wait; we can't do
anything with damn Lozano here.

189
00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:48,242
It disgusts me to come to
these filthy holes.

190
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:50,889
- It fills me with nausea.
- You don't come for pleasure?

191
00:23:50,924 --> 00:23:55,194
Hear that dirty music.
It speaks to the lowest of men.

192
00:23:55,229 --> 00:23:58,863
Look around; everything is
just vice and shadows.

193
00:23:58,898 --> 00:24:02,953
Thick, smelly smoke;
drunkenness and lust.

194
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:07,817
- Especially lust.
- So what? You've business to attend to.

195
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:37,321
- Enough! I can't take any more of this!
- Juan Carlos!

196
00:24:41,631 --> 00:24:45,431
- That guy is drunk.
- What's wrong with him?

197
00:25:02,452 --> 00:25:07,084
Now that you're calm,
can you explain your absurd behavior?

198
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,164
I can't; I can't
understand it myself.

199
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:14,462
There's something wrong with you,
something serious.

200
00:25:14,497 --> 00:25:17,101
What is it?
Why you don't say?

201
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:23,003
I just don't know.
Except that every day, I lose even more.

202
00:25:23,635 --> 00:25:28,594
I feel like I'm losing my my mind.
I'm about to fall into the abyss.

203
00:25:29,246 --> 00:25:31,892
Then, I feel a deep fear.

204
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:35,235
Cold, thoughtless!

205
00:25:35,829 --> 00:25:37,577
But I can't define what it is.

206
00:25:37,612 --> 00:25:42,806
I'm your friend, also a doctor.
I can help you, trust me.

207
00:25:43,548 --> 00:25:47,546
We must dig into the depths of your soul.

208
00:25:47,927 --> 00:25:51,917
- Dig into my soul?
- The idea scares you, right?

209
00:25:51,952 --> 00:25:57,530
And rightly so; we all carry an inner demon,
who doesn't want to faced.

210
00:25:57,565 --> 00:26:00,540
There are many aspects
about ourselves that we ignore.

211
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:03,102
Things that have been buried deep inside,
that hurt even more.

212
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:09,880
That must be it: this destroying fear
is within my own soul.

213
00:26:10,262 --> 00:26:13,878
Haunting me in the back,
from my inner darkness.

214
00:26:13,913 --> 00:26:20,154
- You see?
- Help me, Eugenio. Save my soul,
if we have time.

215
00:26:20,189 --> 00:26:22,898
It depends on yourself,
on your courage.

216
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:26,585
I will be your guide,
but you have to do the hard work.

217
00:26:27,075 --> 00:26:30,567
It's a difficult task,
one impossible for a coward.

218
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:37,509
You'll reach the darkest part of your conscience,
and confront your more horrific creatures.

219
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,312
I have the will to do it.

220
00:26:39,543 --> 00:26:43,749
Considers that very brave souls have
gone back to confront their uncleanness;

221
00:26:43,784 --> 00:26:48,288
and having once receded, are lost forever.

222
00:26:48,323 --> 00:26:51,022
I won't. I'll be doing as you will me to.

223
00:26:51,352 --> 00:26:55,543
Then, let us begin with the
formal treatment now.

224
00:26:55,578 --> 00:26:58,068
Come with me.

225
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:14,649
Lie down on the couch.

226
00:27:17,533 --> 00:27:21,510
Lie down, feel comfortable.
Try to calm down.

227
00:27:54,457 --> 00:27:57,689
And now, let your imagination
freely overflow.

228
00:27:57,724 --> 00:28:02,176
Let the thoughts come to your
mind, without resisting.

229
00:28:02,658 --> 00:28:05,651
And if any thought disgusts you,
don't try to push it away.

230
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:10,948
Usually, we defend ourselves against thoughts
that bring us a lot of harm.

231
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:16,524
We'll have a quiet conversation.
I'll ask questions, not look for answers.

232
00:28:16,844 --> 00:28:19,504
Answer quickly what first come to mind.

233
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,544
Ask me.

234
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:28,692
What comes to your mind,
just remembering your sense of fear?

235
00:28:29,684 --> 00:28:31,489
The faceless man!

236
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:35,086
Don't get up,
rest.

237
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:41,149
Who is the faceless man?

238
00:28:41,184 --> 00:28:45,271
- The murderer.
- Why is he faceless?

239
00:28:46,365 --> 00:28:51,504
- Because of my dreams.
- Your dreams? Tell me about them.

240
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:57,479
Dreams hold secrets,
even though we refuse to acknowledge that.

241
00:28:57,514 --> 00:28:59,691
What are you dreaming about?

242
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:02,507
There is one specific dream,

243
00:29:02,948 --> 00:29:05,981
a recurring one, like an obsession.

244
00:29:06,016 --> 00:29:07,999
I want to hear about it.

245
00:29:08,034 --> 00:29:11,722
There's a woman in the mist,

246
00:29:12,414 --> 00:29:18,365
a woman who orders me to
go behind the murderer...

247
00:29:19,518 --> 00:29:28,804
she says not until I unmask that man,
will I achieve my rest.

248
00:29:30,057 --> 00:29:34,399
Then, I saw him.

249
00:29:34,911 --> 00:29:38,867
He leaves, but without haste.

250
00:29:39,356 --> 00:29:45,167
I go after him, with anger.
Sometimes I kill him,

251
00:29:45,202 --> 00:29:48,837
at other times,
I can only stop him.

252
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:54,566
But at every opportunity,
when I crave to see that unknown face,

253
00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:01,313
I find that he is... faceless.

254
00:30:02,207 --> 00:30:09,659
So I'm overcome by this fear
that eats at my soul.

255
00:30:11,344 --> 00:30:18,378
Then, the lady laughs at me,
and mocks my failure.

256
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:25,414
Juan Carlos, are you afraid
to see the face of the murderer?

257
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:31,086
Fear? On the contrary,
it's my greatest wish.

258
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:35,662
Right. Now tell me,
do you know who that lady is?

259
00:30:35,697 --> 00:30:43,690
My mother... I mean,
no! I don't know her.

260
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:48,275
It's very important to tell me the truth.

261
00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:58,627
- Yes, my mother.
- Why did you deny it before?

262
00:30:58,662 --> 00:31:02,844
Because I wasn't aware of it.
Only until now was I sure.

263
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:06,523
We keep forgetting the
cruelest aspects of our dreams.

264
00:31:06,855 --> 00:31:11,490
- This is the most cruel.
- Leave it for now.

265
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:15,073
- There's another dream.
- Oppressive as well?

266
00:31:15,905 --> 00:31:18,856
Very oppressive, and fairly recent.

267
00:31:19,308 --> 00:31:21,986
I had it, just last night.

268
00:31:22,277 --> 00:31:24,923
I entered the foyer of my own home,

269
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:28,168
but walked in the shadows,

270
00:31:28,203 --> 00:31:31,811
hopeless, unable to recognize
anything in my environment.

271
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:40,630
Suddenly, some grotesque inanimate
forms surrounded me,

272
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:45,867
statues, reminiscent of vague human shapes,

273
00:31:45,902 --> 00:31:51,865
blurred, asexual.
Especially, asexual.

274
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:58,051
However, I knew that those ghosts
were cheap sluts.

275
00:31:58,086 --> 00:32:01,141
I wanted to buy them with all my heart,

276
00:32:01,176 --> 00:32:05,838
but the offer was disgusting to me.
I tried not to look at them anymore,

277
00:32:06,662 --> 00:32:09,005
and continued on my way.

278
00:32:10,852 --> 00:32:17,586
I steadily returned to the dark.
I knew my fate:

279
00:32:17,621 --> 00:32:22,341
I would go to an undue place,
in a hurry.

280
00:32:22,376 --> 00:32:29,216
Yes! I finally faced the feared and desired
forbidden door.

281
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,475
I could not miss that opportunity.

282
00:32:50,197 --> 00:32:55,007
I entered, even though I knew
I shouldn't.

283
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:07,629
Now, I had to descend to
the depths of my own home,

284
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:13,299
down without hesitation,

285
00:33:13,334 --> 00:33:17,643
everything underneath where one
can get, in a vacuum.

286
00:33:31,146 --> 00:33:35,007
So, my feet reached the
bottom of the abyss.

287
00:33:38,445 --> 00:33:41,221
And after wandering wearily,

288
00:33:41,643 --> 00:33:45,649
I stopped. I stopped with
deep anguish!

289
00:33:46,141 --> 00:33:52,546
Because I had just entered
the realm of my biggest fear.

290
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,834
There, the monster was chained,

291
00:33:56,194 --> 00:34:01,646
content in a prison which
he should never leave.

292
00:34:02,295 --> 00:34:05,856
Moaning in sadness
for his old enclosure,

293
00:34:05,891 --> 00:34:11,442
He cried for his chain,
as old as antiquity itself.

294
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:14,718
My soul was full of sorrow,

295
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:20,228
I decided to release the monster,
at any price.

296
00:34:25,543 --> 00:34:30,311
Just saw it off, and I knew
that with this rash act,

297
00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:34,228
my soul was lost forever!

298
00:34:40,062 --> 00:34:42,581
He did it, Eugenio.

299
00:34:43,062 --> 00:34:45,517
He accepted the offer,

300
00:34:45,552 --> 00:34:50,480
bought them to destroy them,
to shred them to death...

301
00:34:50,731 --> 00:34:52,237
in a vicious attack!

302
00:34:53,979 --> 00:34:56,412
Then, he started out again
on the streets.

303
00:34:56,447 --> 00:35:01,290
No rush,
absurdly quiet.

304
00:35:01,325 --> 00:35:05,057
Suddenly, he stopped and
turned to look me in the eyes!

305
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:08,987
My blood ran cold.

306
00:35:09,022 --> 00:35:17,700
My God, the faceless murderer!
Released by my own hand!

307
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,806
That damn spectre,

308
00:35:20,228 --> 00:35:23,205
during the days
I go after him,

309
00:35:23,507 --> 00:35:28,091
and during the nights
he comes after me.

310
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:31,699
What you've told me
is very interesting,

311
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,775
that the faceless man isn't the
murderer.

312
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:40,294
Dreams never say
what they really mean,

313
00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:42,600
they're expressed symbolically.

314
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:46,270
For example, the statues
of women for sale,

315
00:35:46,305 --> 00:35:49,897
represent prostitutes,

316
00:35:49,932 --> 00:35:53,095
which are the target
of the murderer.

317
00:35:54,142 --> 00:36:01,347
It's true. I can see
that clearly now.

318
00:36:01,382 --> 00:36:03,504
No doubt, your obsession with the murderer,

319
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:08,007
has a deep connection with
a sexual symbol,

320
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:11,840
so we must explore that avenue.

321
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:17,288
- What avenue?
- Your love life.

322
00:36:17,323 --> 00:36:22,102
My love life?
What is this, Eugenio?

323
00:36:22,137 --> 00:36:25,361
I never loved any woman
but my mother.

324
00:36:25,396 --> 00:36:28,990
This is the second time you've
mentioned her, there's a reason behind it.

325
00:36:29,025 --> 00:36:34,206
Besides love, what else
do you associate with her? Speak quickly.

326
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:39,379
Failure.
The story of my life.

327
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:44,625
What failure?
A broken heart, perhaps?

328
00:36:45,156 --> 00:36:52,239
Yeah, In some way that
ended up with a broken heart.

329
00:36:53,453 --> 00:36:57,354
- How can you know that?
- Talk me about your broken heart.

330
00:36:58,705 --> 00:37:00,480
It's of no importance.

331
00:37:00,515 --> 00:37:02,511
Even so, I want to hear about it.

332
00:37:02,546 --> 00:37:05,985
What for? Actually, it didn't have
much effect on my life.

333
00:37:06,297 --> 00:37:09,357
- I didn't love her.
- Even so, talk about it.

334
00:37:11,474 --> 00:37:14,267
I was about to get married,

335
00:37:14,989 --> 00:37:18,137
some years ago,
in my hometown.

336
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:20,974
It happened during one of my vacations...

337
00:37:21,465 --> 00:37:26,866
in Guadalajara. My girlfriend
Ana Maria was an orphan...

338
00:37:26,901 --> 00:37:29,356
my mother gave her refuge
as a child,

339
00:37:29,357 --> 00:37:32,081
and treated her like a daughter.

340
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:36,065
So, she lived at home,
always near to me.

341
00:37:37,258 --> 00:37:41,155
We confused our feelings,
due to our constant companionship.

342
00:37:41,507 --> 00:37:44,476
We believed we shared
a deep love.

343
00:37:45,168 --> 00:37:48,916
I wanted to marry her,
at a date fast approaching.

344
00:37:49,347 --> 00:37:52,855
Then, an obstacle that we had almost
forgotten appeared,

345
00:37:53,316 --> 00:37:56,173
that filled us with fear.

346
00:37:56,855 --> 00:38:00,491
- Juan Carlos!
- Everything's ready,
Ana Maria...

347
00:38:00,526 --> 00:38:02,859
our wedding's next month.

348
00:38:03,351 --> 00:38:07,024
It's too soon, we must wait.

349
00:38:07,304 --> 00:38:09,721
Why? Don't you love me?

350
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:15,523
You know I love you, but don't you think
your mom should know about our plans?

351
00:38:15,558 --> 00:38:19,439
- Of course.
- Aren't you afraid of her reaction?

352
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,081
I do. She's going to hate me.

353
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:26,829
She keeps saying that the woman you love
will be the thief who'll take you away from her.

354
00:38:26,864 --> 00:38:29,778
And that you belong only to her.

355
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:35,097
And she would consider your wife
as an intruder,

356
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:37,327
and she would never be forgiven!

357
00:38:39,904 --> 00:38:43,076
My mother was very kind,
but way too possessive,

358
00:38:43,427 --> 00:38:46,711
she was terrified to share
my love with someone else.

359
00:38:47,293 --> 00:38:52,760
she always tried to control me,
forgetting that I was no longer a child.

360
00:38:53,192 --> 00:38:58,347
I thought that satisfying her desires
was my main duty.

361
00:38:58,617 --> 00:39:00,845
My biggest satisfaction.

362
00:39:01,396 --> 00:39:07,506
But I wasn't going to give her the opportunity
to speak about my wedding.

363
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:09,103
So I told that to Ana Maria.

364
00:39:09,276 --> 00:39:14,314
I don't mind if your mother objects,
even if she hates me.

365
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:16,779
I respect her, love her.

366
00:39:17,171 --> 00:39:19,454
But I love you even more.

367
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:22,529
- Ana Maria...
- Juan Carlos...

368
00:39:22,564 --> 00:39:27,327
I wasn't sure that you loved me enough
to have such an independent will.

369
00:39:27,362 --> 00:39:29,910
I know it's a big load for you,

370
00:39:29,945 --> 00:39:36,396
So I'll be your wife at any time.
No regrets.

371
00:39:38,912 --> 00:39:41,687
However, she never became my wife.

372
00:39:41,722 --> 00:39:45,430
Because of my mother, in some way.

373
00:39:46,082 --> 00:39:50,662
Fortunately, I had a head's up.
I discovered my mistake.

374
00:39:51,093 --> 00:39:53,224
One afternoon, after returning home,

375
00:39:53,656 --> 00:39:55,744
I heard a cry, and a
hysterical voice in the room.

376
00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:02,905
Thankless, ungrateful!
This is the love of a "mother"?

377
00:40:03,336 --> 00:40:06,949
This is my reward for the love
and care that I've given to you?

378
00:40:06,984 --> 00:40:11,170
I saved you from misery,
picked you up from the street!

379
00:40:11,205 --> 00:40:13,576
So this is my reward?

380
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:18,704
My son... is mine!
Mine, you hear?

381
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:23,776
My son will not be in the arms of another woman,
not while I'm alive!

382
00:40:23,811 --> 00:40:25,616
That was too much for me!

383
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:30,758
For the first time, I felt a furious
rebellion against mom!

384
00:40:30,793 --> 00:40:36,795
I rebelled against her authority,
against my slavery!

385
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:40,948
against everything that had
represented the essence of my life.

386
00:40:42,244 --> 00:40:45,133
No, Ana Maria, he will never
be yours.

387
00:40:45,168 --> 00:40:49,623
Enough!
Shut up! Say no more.

388
00:40:49,658 --> 00:40:52,003
- Juan Carlos!
- You've shocked me!

389
00:40:52,038 --> 00:40:54,885
- Your selfishness is monstrous!
- My son.

390
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,126
Don't "son" me. I don't need
a dubious love.

391
00:40:58,161 --> 00:41:01,793
- Juan Carlos...
- Leave me, let me free myself.

392
00:41:01,828 --> 00:41:05,268
I don't want this woman
to continue enslaving me.

393
00:41:05,303 --> 00:41:07,959
My happiness lies with Ana Maria,
don't you get it?!

394
00:41:07,994 --> 00:41:14,327
- My life belongs to you, Juan Carlos.
- I don't care about your life!

395
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:18,236
It seemed as if I had physically injured her,
in a mortal way.

396
00:41:18,271 --> 00:41:20,372
I, her very own son!

397
00:41:20,803 --> 00:41:26,525
She paled, turned away,
and when she was going out,

398
00:41:27,087 --> 00:41:29,560
faded away.

399
00:41:33,703 --> 00:41:37,861
My words were so harmful,
she fell ill.

400
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:41,265
She was slowly dying,
and I was filled with regret.

401
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:47,077
I felt like her murderer,
as if I had stabbed her.

402
00:41:47,518 --> 00:41:52,502
I was filled with a grudge
against Ana Maria, the culprit.

403
00:41:53,837 --> 00:41:58,272
That tense situation ended up
in a deep crisis.

404
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:01,232
The night my mother was dying.

405
00:42:01,633 --> 00:42:07,514
When she called me,
I came in fear and shame.

406
00:42:07,549 --> 00:42:09,810
I didn't know how to handle the situation.

407
00:42:10,372 --> 00:42:15,585
Ana Maria was there,
I think I looked at her with hatred!

408
00:42:15,885 --> 00:42:23,629
She looked away, no longer
with those loving eyes I knew.

409
00:42:24,645 --> 00:42:28,438
Juan Carlos, my son, come closer.

410
00:42:28,768 --> 00:42:32,960
I want you to hear me,
maybe for the last time.

411
00:42:36,134 --> 00:42:40,002
I will die soon.

412
00:42:40,037 --> 00:42:43,806
No mother! Don't even
say that!

413
00:42:43,841 --> 00:42:52,067
I'll die, and as all I've ever wanted
is your happiness,

414
00:42:52,459 --> 00:42:55,736
marry her, Juan Carlos.

415
00:42:56,156 --> 00:43:02,462
Marry Ana Maria, if that is
your desire.

416
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:07,953
Marry her, even if it costs
me my life.

417
00:43:07,988 --> 00:43:11,221
No mother, you won't die,
I'm not going to marry her.

418
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:16,247
Live! Don't leave me alone
with this terrible remorse!

419
00:43:16,282 --> 00:43:19,914
I swear I will not marry while you live.

420
00:43:19,949 --> 00:43:26,198
- Don't you love her?
- I... hate her.

421
00:43:26,659 --> 00:43:32,484
I deeply hate her for the
damage she did to you!

422
00:43:41,823 --> 00:43:53,910
So we must be this way.
I will live, perhaps forever!

423
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:58,672
Since then, Ana Maria and I were strangers.

424
00:43:59,534 --> 00:44:05,797
- We weren't able to forgive her.
- But your mother regained her health?

425
00:44:06,278 --> 00:44:08,317
Completely healed.

426
00:44:08,352 --> 00:44:10,861
- How did you know?
- It's logical,

427
00:44:11,212 --> 00:44:13,747
the cause of it disappeared,
and so the disease ceased.

428
00:44:13,782 --> 00:44:16,116
She had gotten away with it.

429
00:44:16,151 --> 00:44:21,031
- Away with it?
- Leave that, for good.

430
00:44:21,066 --> 00:44:25,764
The important thing is that we begin
to discover the source of your anxiety.

431
00:44:26,235 --> 00:44:34,189
Is it not your fear, a desire to fail?

432
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:39,869
- Who wants to fail?
- So many! Maybe even you.

433
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:46,241
Since you were a child, you learned to curb
your desires, to please your mother,

434
00:44:46,276 --> 00:44:50,412
and you maintained that habit.

435
00:44:50,447 --> 00:44:54,368
But as an adult, your impulses
have become too large to restrain,

436
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:57,598
you let them manifest,
but only for a time,

437
00:44:57,633 --> 00:45:03,261
and at the end, you've chosen
to abandon those urges.

438
00:45:03,763 --> 00:45:05,212
Maybe...

439
00:45:05,493 --> 00:45:07,663
And your crush has been the same.

440
00:45:07,964 --> 00:45:12,139
You're wrong! I didn't actually
love Ana Maria!

441
00:45:12,174 --> 00:45:16,391
You've never wanted
to be free from your mother.

442
00:45:16,407 --> 00:45:21,481
You lie! My mother passed away
two years ago; I haven't changed.

443
00:45:21,516 --> 00:45:27,316
The saying "the dead speak out"
is true, Juan Carlos.

444
00:45:28,499 --> 00:45:29,845
Don't say that.

445
00:45:30,176 --> 00:45:31,885
If someone controls us too much,
even if it is out of love,

446
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,909
they become an object of hatred.

447
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,300
Sometimes, unwittingly,
we wish the death of that person.

448
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:40,693
- That's a lie!
- Your life is full of remorse.

449
00:45:40,728 --> 00:45:45,429
Because until today, you think you've
killed your mother, because of your desires.

450
00:45:45,464 --> 00:45:48,087
That's a lie! It's not true!

451
00:45:48,122 --> 00:45:54,081
Your loving failure may be
related to the murderer,

452
00:45:54,116 --> 00:45:59,174
who commits crimes of a sexual nature.

453
00:45:59,209 --> 00:46:01,625
Enough! Shut up!

454
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,820
- You must enjoy increasing my confusion!
-Courage, courage.

455
00:46:04,855 --> 00:46:09,110
No time to step back.
Don't lose heart!

456
00:46:09,145 --> 00:46:13,464
- You're trying to scare me.
- On the contrary!

457
00:46:13,499 --> 00:46:16,135
I want to rest for today,
I feel exhausted.

458
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:19,135
I'm sick, I have no strength
to continue.

459
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:22,021
Okay, we must revisit this
another day.

460
00:46:22,056 --> 00:46:25,598
Perhaps we worked too hard
in the first session.

461
00:46:26,656 --> 00:46:30,208
Remember that your salvation depends
on your perseverance.

462
00:46:33,563 --> 00:46:36,344
My salvation?

463
00:46:36,379 --> 00:46:39,919
Or perhaps my ultimate downfall.

464
00:46:48,986 --> 00:46:52,395
Finally, I just dragged him
in the direction I wanted.

465
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:55,702
He's already in my hands!

466
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:15,474
Juan Carlos...

467
00:47:17,499 --> 00:47:19,875
Why would you never talk to me?

468
00:47:20,917 --> 00:47:23,398
I have nothing to say.

469
00:47:24,162 --> 00:47:26,791
For several days now you've returned,

470
00:47:26,826 --> 00:47:29,836
even told me that you were
glad to see me.

471
00:47:30,789 --> 00:47:36,054
I've been looking forward to your return,

472
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:39,879
as if God only gave me life
to see you again.

473
00:47:40,585 --> 00:47:43,658
Since your mother died,
I've been here,

474
00:47:43,693 --> 00:47:47,973
waiting, with my heart full
of love for you, as always.

475
00:47:48,613 --> 00:47:51,573
Dreaming to be yours.

476
00:47:51,608 --> 00:47:54,927
Yes, I know this is just a dream,
an absurd dream,

477
00:47:54,962 --> 00:47:59,477
but nothing's changed by your absence,
or this silence, which is even worse!

478
00:48:00,265 --> 00:48:03,059
Hope is in me.

479
00:48:03,094 --> 00:48:04,454
You're very wrong.

480
00:48:04,875 --> 00:48:08,932
My mother didn't separate us,
but my own will.

481
00:48:09,401 --> 00:48:13,700
Alive or dead, mom has nothing
to do with this.

482
00:48:15,205 --> 00:48:18,461
I didn't love you, Ana Maria.

483
00:48:18,496 --> 00:48:22,128
That broke our engagement, forever.

484
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:24,955
Got it!?

485
00:48:26,129 --> 00:48:28,797
Forever...

486
00:48:30,511 --> 00:48:37,334
Coward...! Coward!
You're a Coward, Juan Carlos!

487
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:40,867
You lie,
you know you're lying,

488
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:45,718
You love me as I love you,
but you deny it out of cowardice!

489
00:48:46,437 --> 00:48:52,408
By denying your weakness,
by not escaping your authoritarian mother.

490
00:48:53,007 --> 00:48:57,600
You stand by your lie now,
as you will, forever.

491
00:48:57,991 --> 00:49:01,339
Coward, indeed!
Coward!

492
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:05,480
Your mother continues to exert
her ghostly will on you!

493
00:49:05,515 --> 00:49:09,078
She is still a barrier between us.

494
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:18,838
She may as well be still alive.
As she said... forever.

495
00:50:19,496 --> 00:50:21,402
What happens, Juan Carlos?

496
00:50:21,437 --> 00:50:25,275
Who's that slut that smooches
with a thug, at the door of my house!?

497
00:50:25,817 --> 00:50:27,808
That may be Rosa, the maid.

498
00:50:27,843 --> 00:50:30,751
She is not a slut, and
her boyfriend is not a thug.

499
00:50:30,786 --> 00:50:33,650
He is a decent guy, they're getting
married next month.

500
00:50:33,685 --> 00:50:37,378
He comes to town on Sunday,
and comes here to greet Rosa.

501
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:40,976
- Tell her to come.
- What for?
- Tell her to come!

502
00:50:45,604 --> 00:50:48,707
- Rosa!
- Go. See you tomorrow!

503
00:50:48,742 --> 00:50:50,928
I'm coming, dear!

504
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:59,388
- Yes, miss.
- He wants to talk to you.
- Pick up your stuff and leave.

505
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:03,177
- You're fired.
- Fired? Why?

506
00:51:03,212 --> 00:51:06,354
This is a decent house.
Beat it.

507
00:51:06,389 --> 00:51:08,803
- Don't you hear me, get out!
- How is she going to leave at this hour?

508
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:12,481
- It's close to midnight.
Where can she go?
- That's her business.

509
00:51:12,516 --> 00:51:16,226
Don't worry miss, I can take
care of myself and I've got a place to go.

510
00:51:16,787 --> 00:51:18,451
I'll get my things.

511
00:52:03,566 --> 00:52:07,544
Good bye, miss. Thanks for
being nice to me.

512
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:10,487
Nice? I couldn't help
your dismissal.

513
00:52:10,522 --> 00:52:13,450
Don't worry, The decision
was made by the Master.

514
00:52:13,941 --> 00:52:16,120
I'll stop by here to say hello.

515
00:52:16,155 --> 00:52:21,289
- I'll send the promised wedding gift.
- Thank you, miss!
- Take care.

516
00:52:21,324 --> 00:52:23,265
Bye.

517
00:53:25,212 --> 00:53:28,737
- What do you want?
- I'm a police officer.

518
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:32,478
- A cop?
- I need to know if Rosa Martinez
worked here.

519
00:53:32,513 --> 00:53:36,189
- Yes, why do you ask?
- Why did she leave home at
midnight with her stuff?

520
00:53:36,224 --> 00:53:38,917
Well, the homeowner fired her.

521
00:53:38,952 --> 00:53:41,524
I want to have a word with him.

522
00:53:42,046 --> 00:53:44,477
Wait a moment.

523
00:53:45,678 --> 00:53:49,710
I just fired her. I have the right
to make that decision, don't I?

524
00:53:49,745 --> 00:53:52,903
- Certainly.
- So, I have nothing more to say.

525
00:53:56,387 --> 00:53:58,727
Why this question?

526
00:53:59,233 --> 00:54:01,296
Has something happened to that woman?

527
00:54:01,331 --> 00:54:06,903
Yes, and in a way, you are responsible
for sending her into the street at that hour.

528
00:54:20,722 --> 00:54:24,146
What happened to her?
Say it.

529
00:54:25,132 --> 00:54:30,175
- Please give me your name.
- Juan Carlos Lozano.

530
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,601
Juan Carlos Lozano? From
the police?

531
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,443
The city police, yes.

532
00:54:34,478 --> 00:54:37,902
Ah, you're here to
track the mutilator.

533
00:54:40,472 --> 00:54:43,931
The mutilator?
Why do you ask?!

534
00:54:43,966 --> 00:54:46,837
Because the mutilator was here.

535
00:54:51,827 --> 00:54:54,722
Your maid has been his
latest victim.

536
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,867
She was slaughtered just a few
steps away from here.

537
00:54:58,198 --> 00:55:03,388
And I think he chose that victim only
to mock you, and the police.

538
00:55:06,213 --> 00:55:10,293
Go to police headquarters,
there you'll find our collaboration.

539
00:55:10,328 --> 00:55:13,042
I'm at your service, unconditionally.

540
00:55:13,464 --> 00:55:17,737
- Excuse me. So long, miss.
- Good evening.

541
00:55:30,329 --> 00:55:34,939
- What's wrong, Juan Carlos?
- I'm lost, Ana Maria...

542
00:55:34,974 --> 00:55:37,357
- I'm lost.
- Why?

543
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:43,064
My intuition didn't fail,
it was not just my imagination.

544
00:55:43,956 --> 00:55:48,910
- The murderer is after me.
- What are you saying?

545
00:55:49,331 --> 00:55:54,588
You can't imagine the horror
of my situation, Ana Maria.

546
00:56:08,381 --> 00:56:11,138
Eugenio.

547
00:56:16,954 --> 00:56:22,631
- You, here in town.
- What's up, why are you looking
at me like that?

548
00:56:22,666 --> 00:56:25,601
- What do you want here?
- I came for duty.

549
00:56:25,636 --> 00:56:28,008
- I came for an important assignment.
- Liar!

550
00:56:28,499 --> 00:56:30,945
Liar?

551
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:33,826
- When did you arrive?
- Yesterday at morning.

552
00:56:33,861 --> 00:56:37,548
- Why didn't you come to me right away?
- Because... I don't know.

553
00:56:37,939 --> 00:56:45,038
I do know.
Follow me. We need to talk.

554
00:56:56,168 --> 00:56:57,475
What happened to Juan Carlos?

555
00:56:57,906 --> 00:57:04,292
I don't know, the news of a crime
that happened near his house made him angry.

556
00:57:04,327 --> 00:57:07,375
Put him in my hands. I'm a doctor,
and a close friend of his.

557
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:10,176
Dr. Eugenio Britel, at your service.

558
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:13,366
And you, you're Ana Maria, right?

559
00:57:13,401 --> 00:57:15,997
Yes, how do you know?

560
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:19,863
- Juan Carlos talked about me?
- A lot.
- Eugenio!

561
00:57:20,281 --> 00:57:24,808
I told you to come.
I need to talk you.

562
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:32,877
There will be time for us
to talk, Ana Maria.

563
00:57:32,912 --> 00:57:35,572
Excuse me.

564
00:57:38,544 --> 00:57:41,927
Here I am, Juan Carlos.
I'm listening.

565
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:46,464
- Do you know that the mutilator
is here, in Guadalajara?
- Yes.

566
00:57:46,499 --> 00:57:51,233
- How do you know?
- I work for the
police, too, you know.

567
00:57:53,046 --> 00:57:55,908
- I know even more about you.
- Like what?

568
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:04,889
That you're the murderer!
You are!

569
00:58:04,924 --> 00:58:09,259
You always have been;
you're here to play with my mind!

570
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:11,643
What do you want from me?

571
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:13,384
I don't understand you!

572
00:58:13,694 --> 00:58:16,840
You want to experiment with me,
like I was a lab rat,

573
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:18,355
and ruin my mind!

574
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:20,391
Do you want to get back to something?

575
00:58:20,426 --> 00:58:23,559
If so, say it now.

576
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:27,143
Put an end to this.

577
00:58:27,178 --> 00:58:29,990
Stop torturing me!

578
00:59:02,377 --> 00:59:05,236
Come on, Juan Carlos;
take it easy.

579
00:59:05,271 --> 00:59:10,189
Are you so deranged
as to say that nonsense?

580
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:14,389
Forgive me... I don't know
what I'm saying.

581
00:59:14,424 --> 00:59:16,336
The murderer is near,
it drives me crazy!

582
00:59:16,371 --> 00:59:17,994
That shouldn't be more
than a coincidence.

583
00:59:18,345 --> 00:59:19,995
That should not affect you this way.

584
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:22,406
- I can't help it.
- Yes, you can.

585
00:59:22,863 --> 00:59:25,226
Why did you abandon the treatment?

586
00:59:25,553 --> 00:59:30,199
- It hurt me.
- What hurts is being brought out of you.

587
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:32,483
Look, you don't even take care of
your personal hygiene.

588
00:59:32,518 --> 00:59:34,459
I don't care about my looks.

589
00:59:34,494 --> 00:59:36,571
This is further evidence of your
morbid abandonment.

590
00:59:37,595 --> 00:59:38,994
Look at that bag,

591
00:59:39,405 --> 00:59:43,859
It's been here for several days,
and you haven't even unpacked it.

592
00:59:43,894 --> 00:59:45,190
I haven't had time.

593
00:59:45,305 --> 00:59:47,744
What about Ana Maria?

594
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:49,726
Ana Maria...?

595
00:59:51,791 --> 00:59:54,327
I don't let her touch my stuff.

596
01:00:09,922 --> 01:00:11,734
What are you doing here,
Juan Carlos?

597
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:15,730
What?

598
01:00:16,271 --> 01:00:19,034
What are you looking for?

599
01:00:21,469 --> 01:00:25,912
That...
what's that?

600
01:00:26,353 --> 01:00:28,107
The knife, don't you see?

601
01:00:29,017 --> 01:00:31,817
- A scalpel.
- A scalpel?

602
01:00:37,365 --> 01:00:39,403
- Where was it stored?
- Here.

603
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:44,195
- I didn't put it there.
- That's not important.

604
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:46,613
This is your stuff from when
you were a medical student.

605
01:00:46,924 --> 01:00:48,435
I got rid of it all.

606
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:53,761
But if that scalpel was mine,
I would know if I'd put it there.

607
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:57,887
It wouldn't be strange to forget
something like this. You're too deranged.

608
01:00:57,922 --> 01:01:01,919
No, I would remember.

609
01:01:01,954 --> 01:01:05,579
I would remember, I say.

610
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:11,151
- Eugenio.
- What?

611
01:01:11,186 --> 01:01:14,949
- Not yours, right?
- Juan Carlos!

612
01:01:31,032 --> 01:01:33,743
You are in an absurd nervous state.

613
01:01:33,778 --> 01:01:37,140
You shouldn't give such importance
to everything that happens around you.

614
01:01:37,175 --> 01:01:39,743
Stop babbling and get out of here!

615
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:44,630
I need to be alone.
Get some rest.

616
01:01:44,665 --> 01:01:45,597
You're right.

617
01:01:46,098 --> 01:01:49,517
I'll come back when you're rested,
and I can be of further assistance.

618
01:01:49,552 --> 01:01:52,194
- If you need me...
- Why would I?

619
01:01:52,449 --> 01:01:57,048
I don't know. In case you need me,
I'll leave you my phone number.

620
01:01:57,083 --> 01:01:58,853
Give it to Ana Maria.

621
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,895
Yes, that would be better.

622
01:05:48,326 --> 01:05:49,677
Ana Maria!

623
01:05:50,038 --> 01:05:53,888
Call doctor Britel!
Ana Maria!

624
01:06:06,884 --> 01:06:10,455
Yes? Yeah, put her on the line.

625
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:12,547
I accept the charge, this is Dr. Britel.

626
01:06:13,493 --> 01:06:15,952
Ana Maria... what do you want?

627
01:06:16,832 --> 01:06:18,730
What's happening?

628
01:06:19,121 --> 01:06:22,148
I'm on my way.
Right now.

629
01:06:23,812 --> 01:06:26,787
Doctor... I thought you'd never come!

630
01:06:26,822 --> 01:06:30,117
Something terrible must be
happening to him; he called for me loudly.

631
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:33,705
Horrible cries, but he won't
let me go into his room.

632
01:06:34,008 --> 01:06:37,589
- That's fine.
- He says that only you can enter.

633
01:06:37,956 --> 01:06:40,282
Don't worry; he's only had
a nervous breakdown.

634
01:06:40,669 --> 01:06:42,564
Wait up here, Ana Maria.

635
01:06:55,564 --> 01:06:58,938
- Ana Maria?
- This is me, Eugenio!

636
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:03,461
- You... by yourself?
- Yes. Open up.

637
01:07:08,505 --> 01:07:10,186
Come in.

638
01:07:13,443 --> 01:07:16,916
- What's up?
- Something terrible...

639
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:23,194
- Something awful.
- What?

640
01:07:24,187 --> 01:07:28,056
Look at my hands.

641
01:07:34,248 --> 01:07:36,557
There's nothing wrong with them.

642
01:07:57,847 --> 01:07:59,803
A few moments ago,
my hands were bleeding.

643
01:07:59,804 --> 01:08:01,757
Endlessly bleeding.

644
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:04,489
I couldn't stop the bleeding.

645
01:08:04,524 --> 01:08:05,712
How is that possible?

646
01:08:06,933 --> 01:08:09,141
I streaked the walls with that blood.

647
01:08:09,597 --> 01:08:12,316
And the towel that
I wanted to clean up with.

648
01:08:17,724 --> 01:08:19,399
This one?

649
01:08:21,135 --> 01:08:23,412
That's the one.

650
01:08:24,412 --> 01:08:28,937
- This is clean, now.
- See for yourself.

651
01:08:52,767 --> 01:08:55,612
The prints are also gone.

652
01:09:03,365 --> 01:09:05,751
What's wrong with me, Eugenio?

653
01:09:05,786 --> 01:09:09,245
- I'm losing my mind.
- Take it easy.

654
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:14,854
It's due to your nervous breakdown. An hallucination
doesn't indicate anything serious.

655
01:09:14,889 --> 01:09:17,641
Perhaps it's nothing but a dream.

656
01:09:17,676 --> 01:09:20,675
No, not a dream.

657
01:09:22,448 --> 01:09:28,938
But the actual projection
of one of my anxiety dreams.

658
01:09:30,137 --> 01:09:32,272
I slept in that chair,

659
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:38,480
and found myself wandering
into the path of the mist, lost.

660
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:44,802
I heard a voice that was guiding
me through the fog.

661
01:09:45,487 --> 01:09:47,609
I didn't see the face.

662
01:09:47,644 --> 01:09:50,259
Just saw a hand, calling me.

663
01:09:50,294 --> 01:09:52,542
It kept calling me.

664
01:09:52,577 --> 01:09:54,440
Inviting.

665
01:09:55,865 --> 01:10:01,643
There were mysterious voices
calling me, softly and ominously,

666
01:10:02,544 --> 01:10:04,385
completely irresistible to me.

667
01:10:24,244 --> 01:10:27,592
So when I got to the lake of Dark Waters,

668
01:10:27,627 --> 01:10:31,575
I stopped, terrified.

669
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:34,470
An irresistible force threw
me to the shore,

670
01:10:35,643 --> 01:10:38,147
and my hands sank into the waters.

671
01:10:38,447 --> 01:10:42,207
I immediately knew what
it was, warm and viscous,

672
01:10:42,618 --> 01:10:46,641
it was blood!
Human blood.

673
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:49,720
The blood of the victims.

674
01:10:49,755 --> 01:10:54,082
The murderer was laughing at me,
running away once again.

675
01:11:07,272 --> 01:11:11,577
The next day, as it was my
eternal doom,

676
01:11:12,492 --> 01:11:19,658
the monster turned to look at me,
so I stopped, drowning.

677
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:23,675
I was once again about to behold
that blurred spot, his face,

678
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:28,332
and thought I couldn't see that face,
without falling hopelessly dead!

679
01:11:29,194 --> 01:11:32,682
However, I couldn't
help staring at it.

680
01:11:32,717 --> 01:11:37,393
Hallucinating, waiting for a hint of a face
to sprout in that fuzzy cloth!

681
01:11:38,429 --> 01:11:44,843
He turned to me,
but the light didn't reach his face.

682
01:11:45,876 --> 01:11:51,297
Then, he headed toward the street light,
so I could see him clearly.

683
01:11:52,701 --> 01:11:57,231
Oh, Lord!
It was my mother!

684
01:11:57,834 --> 01:12:02,022
The murderer was my mother...!

685
01:12:02,425 --> 01:12:04,015
Then I woke up.

686
01:12:05,939 --> 01:12:08,450
But my delirium continued.

687
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:14,458
My hands bled,
until you came here.

688
01:12:17,525 --> 01:12:20,190
I know I'm losing my mind.

689
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:24,164
I know that only you can
help me in this trance.

690
01:12:25,196 --> 01:12:31,388
Here I am, defeated.
Hopelessly defeated.

691
01:12:32,109 --> 01:12:35,365
Willing to obey you.

692
01:12:35,737 --> 01:12:40,548
For the moment, you have to rest
and calm your spirit.

693
01:12:40,829 --> 01:12:43,432
You need to rest.
Deep, restful sleep.

694
01:12:43,813 --> 01:12:46,773
I'll give you an injection so you can
sleep more easily.

695
01:12:51,147 --> 01:12:53,867
Anything you say.

696
01:12:55,433 --> 01:12:58,357
I put my life in your hands.

697
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:10,205
And while I prepared the
powerful narcotic,

698
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:15,074
to avoid tormenting dreams,
I faced the awful truth,

699
01:13:15,598 --> 01:13:18,513
grief and horror
simultaneously assailed me.

700
01:13:18,804 --> 01:13:23,013
Yes, I possessed the diabolical secret
of Juan Carlos.

701
01:13:23,414 --> 01:13:27,381
My hands were shaking,
and I refused to accept it.

702
01:13:27,416 --> 01:13:31,327
But I knew...
Oh, poor friend of mine.

703
01:13:32,099 --> 01:13:33,503
I gave him a shot,

704
01:13:33,904 --> 01:13:38,886
and let him sleep in peace,
for the first time in who knows how long.

705
01:13:39,344 --> 01:13:43,891
But I decided to stay at home,
to watch him.

706
01:13:43,926 --> 01:13:45,601
I asked for a room from Ana Maria.

707
01:13:45,893 --> 01:13:51,933
On a sleepless night, I discovered
that my duty was to let her know.

708
01:13:52,244 --> 01:13:55,522
So I did the next morning...

709
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:02,203
Juan Carlos is facing a terrible
danger, Ana Maria;

710
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:05,529
we have to help him, but I
don't know how.

711
01:14:05,564 --> 01:14:07,126
Doctor, you're scaring me.

712
01:14:07,161 --> 01:14:10,725
He's sleeping soundly, and will
for a few hours more,

713
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,416
under the influence of the drug.

714
01:14:14,278 --> 01:14:19,547
But when he wakes,
you and I must make a decision,

715
01:14:19,582 --> 01:14:22,459
and any option will be very painful.

716
01:14:22,494 --> 01:14:25,719
Doctor, you're scaring me more and more!

717
01:14:29,093 --> 01:14:30,436
Ana Maria,

718
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:33,515
Yes, doctor.

719
01:14:34,617 --> 01:14:39,985
- Do you still love him?
- I do, with my soul.

720
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:42,983
Beware of commiting so easily.

721
01:14:43,926 --> 01:14:45,401
So easily?

722
01:14:45,436 --> 01:14:51,876
So easily, yeah; your love for him will
soon be put to a severe test.

723
01:14:52,628 --> 01:14:56,125
Speak clearly, please.
I beg you...

724
01:14:56,607 --> 01:14:58,549
Take a seat.

725
01:15:00,274 --> 01:15:04,607
Yet I doubt whether it's good or bad
to go further,

726
01:15:04,868 --> 01:15:08,103
but I feel obliged that you know
the whole truth.

727
01:15:08,715 --> 01:15:11,021
I'm listening...

728
01:15:11,358 --> 01:15:14,745
Juan Carlos suffers from a terrible
sickness of the mind.

729
01:15:15,045 --> 01:15:18,187
A split personality.

730
01:15:18,789 --> 01:15:22,287
Within him, there are two beings,
each acting on their own.

731
01:15:22,699 --> 01:15:29,491
We have the conscious and selfless
Juan Carlos, who sacrificed his life to a maternal whim.

732
01:15:29,526 --> 01:15:33,434
On the other hand, one who lives by the instincts
he privately suppressed,

733
01:15:34,042 --> 01:15:37,117
and the latter are in violent rebellion.

734
01:15:37,478 --> 01:15:41,214
I don't get it, doctor,
I can't understand.

735
01:15:41,249 --> 01:15:45,446
Any repression, as any excess,
implies punishment.

736
01:15:45,939 --> 01:15:48,958
The punishment of Juan Carlos
has been enormous.

737
01:15:48,993 --> 01:15:55,404
When the man kills the love of his heart,
he unleashes the fury of hell.

738
01:15:55,439 --> 01:15:59,723
It gives a spiritual imbalance,

739
01:15:59,758 --> 01:16:03,653
and can only survive
by finding shelter.

740
01:16:03,688 --> 01:16:08,675
Some find solace in drinking,
others in suicide,

741
01:16:09,207 --> 01:16:13,053
and others in madness.

742
01:16:13,997 --> 01:16:15,856
Do you understand me?

743
01:16:15,891 --> 01:16:19,134
Doctor...

744
01:16:19,827 --> 01:16:23,054
Is Juan Carlos...
crazy?

745
01:16:23,089 --> 01:16:26,532
I would say that he's
only crazy at certain times.

746
01:16:26,976 --> 01:16:34,612
But he doesn't recognize, and ignores
the savage who dwells within him.

747
01:16:35,123 --> 01:16:40,171
When the savage is released,
through unconscious delusions by him,

748
01:16:40,677 --> 01:16:44,180
- It makes him a...
- A crazy man.

749
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:50,894
Something worse, Ana Maria,

750
01:16:51,953 --> 01:16:54,940
A murderer.

751
01:16:59,352 --> 01:17:04,106
Juan Carlos is the mutilator,
Ana Maria.

752
01:17:04,417 --> 01:17:08,423
The mutilator...?

753
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:12,596
You lie!
You lie!

754
01:17:18,695 --> 01:17:21,883
I wish I was lying.

755
01:17:21,918 --> 01:17:26,445
- How did you know?
- At first, it was almost a wild guess.

756
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,458
Because he has confirmed it, gradually
and without realizing it.

757
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:35,601
In each of the dreams he's
told me, the truth was laid bare.

758
01:17:36,098 --> 01:17:40,884
First, he released a monster
which became the murderer.

759
01:17:40,919 --> 01:17:44,330
Then he blamed himself
in his delirium about bloody hands,

760
01:17:44,365 --> 01:17:47,602
which represented the blood of his victims.

761
01:17:47,637 --> 01:17:52,571
And he accused his mother of being
to blame for everything.

762
01:17:52,606 --> 01:17:59,938
And then, his deep fear to discover
the identity of the murderer.

763
01:18:00,313 --> 01:18:06,430
- But that doesn't prove anything!
- Abandon all hope, Ana Maria.

764
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:10,574
There is sufficient evidence.
I have also seen the weapon.

765
01:18:10,609 --> 01:18:12,844
In his room.

766
01:18:14,098 --> 01:18:18,235
We stayed silent,
dismayed,

767
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:21,750
wondering what to do, how to help him?

768
01:18:22,221 --> 01:18:23,922
What to do, oh Lord?

769
01:18:23,957 --> 01:18:28,654
A friend so dear, so innocent,
but monstrously guilty.

770
01:18:29,165 --> 01:18:34,951
The shadows of the night, as
the shadows of my discoveries,
fell upon us.

771
01:18:34,986 --> 01:18:39,062
We didn't know how to
face our horrible duty.

772
01:18:39,097 --> 01:18:43,486
That restless night...

773
01:18:43,521 --> 01:18:47,980
I heard a loud noise,
towards the room of Juan Carlos.

774
01:18:48,015 --> 01:18:52,427
My heart trembled,
I'd given him another shot,

775
01:18:52,462 --> 01:18:56,379
so that he slept in peace.
Something serious must be going on,

776
01:18:56,414 --> 01:18:59,223
if, despite that, he was still awake.

777
01:18:59,258 --> 01:19:06,180
I woke up with the desire that the
noise had nothing to do with his inner demon.

778
01:19:06,215 --> 01:19:08,365
I heard new noises.

779
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,640
I decided to deal with that,
and I went to his room.

780
01:19:29,685 --> 01:19:33,461
As a precaution,
I left him locked up,

781
01:19:33,496 --> 01:19:36,264
so he would have to break
the lock to get out.

782
01:19:36,299 --> 01:19:42,099
Oh, Lord. Is that Juan Carlos,
or his monster?

783
01:19:42,134 --> 01:19:44,698
He abandoned the attempt, and left.

784
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:47,950
I heard his troubled footsteps,

785
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:52,839
that for the time being,
remained quiet.

786
01:19:53,191 --> 01:19:57,145
That lack of a human voice,
filled me with horror!

787
01:20:01,637 --> 01:20:06,669
What unspeakable situation
may be happening in those shadows?

788
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:46,925
Doctor... Doctor!!

789
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:49,498
Precaution acted against us.

790
01:22:49,789 --> 01:22:53,561
Having heard my warning,
she had locked herself inside.

791
01:22:56,433 --> 01:22:59,784
Juan Carlos...

792
01:22:59,819 --> 01:23:02,865
This is me, Ana Maria.

793
01:23:53,223 --> 01:23:58,806
Juan Carlos... Juan Carlos...
Juan Carlos!

794
01:23:59,228 --> 01:24:02,816
There lay my poor,
dear friend.

795
01:24:02,851 --> 01:24:07,305
At my feet, bleeding from
a deadly wound.

796
01:24:07,687 --> 01:24:12,098
Dying from the bullet that I shot at him.

797
01:24:12,133 --> 01:24:16,203
He opened his eyes; his gaze
again became tender, human.

798
01:24:19,552 --> 01:24:25,482
- Ana Maria...
- I felt as if a claw was squeezing my heart.

799
01:24:25,517 --> 01:24:30,727
The devil had finally left his soul.

800
01:24:30,762 --> 01:24:33,395
Ana Maria...

801
01:24:40,506 --> 01:24:44,135
Eugenio!

802
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:46,570
Eugenio.

803
01:24:47,664 --> 01:24:50,928
The murderer was here tonight?

804
01:24:53,566 --> 01:24:57,867
I heard him coming...

805
01:24:59,914 --> 01:25:01,358
Assaulting Ana Maria...

806
01:25:02,214 --> 01:25:03,618
Right?

807
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:10,193
But I came to defend her.

808
01:25:10,821 --> 01:25:14,743
Yes, Juan Carlos, you
defended her courageously.

809
01:25:15,549 --> 01:25:17,413
You fought with the murderer
and managed to kill him.

810
01:25:18,696 --> 01:25:20,558
Praise God!

811
01:25:20,593 --> 01:25:23,853
But you're seriously injured.

812
01:25:23,888 --> 01:25:28,707
I saved Ana Maria,
I don't care if I die.

813
01:25:39,233 --> 01:25:44,985
Forgive me, Ana Maria,
what a coward I was.

814
01:25:47,821 --> 01:25:55,619
Kiss me... Give me the
kiss I hadn't the guts to ask for.

815
01:25:58,268 --> 01:26:02,393
He didn't know where he was,
or how he got there.

816
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:10,272
It must have been like a dream to him.
The last of his dreams.

817
01:26:10,681 --> 01:26:14,397
He smiled,
leaning his head,

818
01:26:15,297 --> 01:26:19,842
and left his passions
and place out of this mortal world.

819
01:26:23,101 --> 01:26:29,867
And so I,
I became a murderer.

820
01:26:44,885 --> 01:26:50,417
Police Headquarters?
This is Dr. Britel.

821
01:26:50,452 --> 01:26:54,294
At house number 503,

822
01:26:54,329 --> 01:26:58,154
lies a murderer, waiting for
the arrival of justice.

823
01:26:59,389 --> 01:27:03,551
Hello...?
Hello...?

824
01:27:04,439 --> 01:27:07,116
Hello...?
Who is this?

825
01:27:10,176 --> 01:27:14,547
Subtitled exclusively for Cinemageddon.
March 2013.
