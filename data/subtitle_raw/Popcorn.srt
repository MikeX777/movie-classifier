1
00:04:04,071 --> 00:04:05,591
Is anyone outside?

2
00:04:06,321 --> 00:04:07,317
Please help!

3
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:08,620
Security!

4
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:09,570
Police!

5
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,019
Security!

6
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:15,205
Is anyone outside?

7
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,203
Sameerana!

8
00:04:21,707 --> 00:04:22,956
Sameerana, wake up!

9
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:49,080
A boy suffering looking
at the helpless girl..

10
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:53,081
Looking at his efforts to save her..

11
00:04:53,582 --> 00:04:56,332
A girl is fighting for her life back.

12
00:04:56,831 --> 00:05:03,058
These two look like they
are related for years..

13
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:04,259
..but that isn't true.

14
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:08,057
These two were strangers
till 18 hours ago.

15
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:10,106
Yes, you heard it right.

16
00:05:10,307 --> 00:05:15,058
Not just accidents, but sometimes people
meeting for the first time can be so dramatic.

17
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:16,557
That begs the question, who are these two?

18
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:19,459
How,
why and where did they meet each other?

19
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:22,009
What lead them to this accident?

20
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:25,309
This may seem unclear to you.

21
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,993
To make it clear, lets go into the story.

22
00:06:11,206 --> 00:06:11,706
Wahh!

23
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:14,957
You look like beauty looking at a mirror.

24
00:06:21,376 --> 00:06:25,624
Even if the guy is a Mr.Universe.

25
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:27,626
It will be difficult to please me.

26
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:33,873
After recent weight loss,
even I can't take my beauty.

27
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,425
I should get my aura cleansed immediately.

28
00:06:42,446 --> 00:06:43,053
Hey Sammi!

29
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:43,861
What happened?

30
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,445
Only you can compete me with my beauty.

31
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:53,702
You looked like a heroine when
you were young. Didn't you?

32
00:06:54,002 --> 00:06:55,002
Madam!

33
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:57,402
I placed all the saplings here.

34
00:06:57,602 --> 00:06:58,401
Saplings?

35
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:13,654
What are all these saplings for Mom?

36
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:17,783
I thought if I can give
pure air to the world,

37
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:21,361
you would be a blessed
with happy and long life.

38
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:26,402
So, starting from tomorrow,
till your next birthday

39
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,450
I am going to plant ten thousand saplings.

40
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:35,426
Sammi! Oh my god.

41
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:37,175
Go get a net.

42
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:39,923
Get it fast.

43
00:07:40,758 --> 00:07:41,758
Go fast!

44
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:51,202
Take this.

45
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,551
Can't you be little careful dear.

46
00:08:16,056 --> 00:08:18,105
It almost lost its life.

47
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:21,304
I was also the same in the morning.

48
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:24,055
Struggled to breathe like this fish.

49
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:27,804
You are savior of both our lives,
Wonder Woman!

50
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:30,605
Stop with the silly banter.

51
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:33,605
Don't forget your inhaler refills.

52
00:08:35,554 --> 00:08:37,553
I worry a lot about you than you do.

53
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:38,556
You never care about yourself.

54
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:40,856
I will be careful Mom.

55
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:41,761
Okay.

56
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:46,305
Get a friend for this fish.

57
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:47,405
Okay. Bye!

58
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:56,425
Auto!

59
00:09:00,431 --> 00:09:01,383
Where to drop?

60
00:09:01,435 --> 00:09:02,085
DSL Mall

61
00:09:02,184 --> 00:09:03,184
Get in.

62
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:27,717
- Bye sir.
- Bye!

63
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,943
Hello Grandpa.

64
00:10:53,443 --> 00:10:55,495
- I'm here sis.
- Hi bro

65
00:10:55,594 --> 00:10:56,594
How many rounds today Granpa?

66
00:10:57,245 --> 00:10:58,344
He finished five.

67
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:00,745
How many rounds did you finish?

68
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,194
Me? Just two.

69
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,495
Just two?

70
00:11:05,944 --> 00:11:07,998
You are Young and energetic

71
00:11:08,098 --> 00:11:11,494
should finish minimum 10 rounds.

72
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:14,246
I will finish by end of the day.

73
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:21,895
Tell me this Pavan,

74
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:26,995
Heard you got an chance to
record a music album in Spain.

75
00:11:27,244 --> 00:11:31,744
Why should you leave such
an opportunity for me?

76
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:35,746
I am not at all happy with your decision.

77
00:11:37,293 --> 00:11:42,245
There's a lot of life for you
to explore and experience.

78
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:43,781
Listen to me.

79
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:50,144
Email them mentioning that
you are accepting the offer

80
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:54,545
Don't worry. I will take care of myself.

81
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:58,243
Grandpa, I can let go of anything for you.

82
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:02,745
This matter ends here.
I can't let anything happen to you.

83
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:05,995
You are my Hero. That's it.

84
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:08,746
We have better things to do.

85
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:11,713
Tomorrow is your birthday.
It will be a grand celebration.

86
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:13,995
I have few shopping plans for that.

87
00:12:14,095 --> 00:12:19,896
So don't disturb me asking to
send mails and check files.

88
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:26,743
Bro. messaged list of items required.
Get them on your way home.

89
00:12:26,994 --> 00:12:28,034
I got it sis.

90
00:12:35,298 --> 00:12:36,378
Grandpa. Are you okay?

91
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:40,049
Why are you roaming on
roads when you are blind.

92
00:12:46,048 --> 00:12:47,048
Grandpa, are you okay?

93
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Sis, take him home safely.

94
00:12:50,548 --> 00:12:52,281
I will be back in a while.

95
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,952
Who are you? What do you want?

96
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:31,449
Where's the girl sitting here?

97
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:35,302
That girl?
She got down because of traffic.

98
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,301
Why are you driving so rashly?

99
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:42,402
Its common aggression
being a Mahesh babu fan.

100
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:48,551
Even Mahesh babu doesn't
encourage such rash driving.

101
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:52,949
She will also pay the price
for her rash behaviour.

102
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:56,200
Chill bro!

103
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:02,059
Happy green day brother.

104
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:07,616
- Happy Green day.
- Thank you.

105
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:27,672
Let me fly away, like a streak of colours.

106
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:32,573
Listen to the tune, like a breeze of song.

107
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:37,920
New dreams are revealed like full moon.

108
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,419
Caressed heart, melts like melody.

109
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:52,820
A colourful sky welcomes me.

110
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:59,918
Overwhelmed with music..

111
00:15:00,671 --> 00:15:02,668
..my heart is elated.

112
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,170
My Heart is elated.

113
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:12,170
My Heart is elated.

114
00:15:15,573 --> 00:15:17,174
My Heart is elated.

115
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:22,221
My Heart is elated.

116
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:27,191
My Heart is elated.

117
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,926
A Parrot, overflowing with colours..

118
00:15:36,026 --> 00:15:40,972
Pollinates the garden and makes it heaven.

119
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,924
A twist in the tune,
rings a bell in your heart.

120
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:51,174
When a tune takes off,
walk turns to dance.

121
00:15:51,424 --> 00:15:56,174
Its all over the place, stay in my lap.

122
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,270
My heart is like you are, little crazy.

123
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:06,172
A word in epic and a tune in heart..

124
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:08,552
..mix these two and its amazing.

125
00:16:11,675 --> 00:16:15,922
Wanting to cross the skies..

126
00:16:16,022 --> 00:16:21,170
..whatever unfolds is our way to freedom.

127
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:26,172
Every tune born, becomes a song..

128
00:16:26,272 --> 00:16:30,671
..creating new life,
this is the truth of life.

129
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,672
My Heart is elated.

130
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:43,919
My Heart is elated.

131
00:16:52,017 --> 00:16:53,324
My Heart is elated.

132
00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:58,421
Let me fly away, like a streak of colours.

133
00:16:59,172 --> 00:17:03,470
Listen what the tune has to say,
like a breeze of song.

134
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:08,670
New dreams are revealed like full moon.

135
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:13,668
Caressed heart, melts like melody.

136
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:23,170
A colourful sky welcomes me.

137
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:31,168
Overwhelmed with music..

138
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:33,221
My Heart is elated.

139
00:17:48,671 --> 00:17:50,417
My Heart is elated!

140
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,269
Oh heck! How did I forget that?

141
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:15,070
Can you open the doors please?
I need to go out.

142
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:21,523
Hello? I need to go out.

143
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,671
Why did you press for basement?

144
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:27,372
Press stop. I will get off next.

145
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,022
Guess he can't hear.

146
00:20:02,883 --> 00:20:08,715
Just one slap on your face.
Everything seems to go wrong.

147
00:20:08,716 --> 00:20:10,016
What does it really mean huh?

148
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:12,966
Are you head strong? or Is my hand strong?

149
00:20:14,716 --> 00:20:15,215
You a psycho?

150
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:18,216
Who the heck are you? Why did you slap me?

151
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:22,465
Hey, why are you whining?

152
00:20:22,758 --> 00:20:23,557
Is it paining?

153
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:26,007
Won't you think of other person's pain?

154
00:20:26,757 --> 00:20:28,008
You have a reason when you feel pain.

155
00:20:28,216 --> 00:20:30,965
But you can't understand when
others feel the pain. Am I right?

156
00:20:31,258 --> 00:20:35,007
Hello. I think you are
taking me for someone else.

157
00:20:35,257 --> 00:20:37,883
Seems you are drunk in the
morning and babbling non sense.

158
00:20:45,758 --> 00:20:50,508
You got slapped for your rash behaviour
and you go on praising your beauty.

159
00:20:51,507 --> 00:20:54,508
Does your peanut brain know
anything called common sense?

160
00:20:55,591 --> 00:20:57,841
You are not even qualified
to talk about beauty.

161
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,092
If there's anyone who
can talk about beauty.

162
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:03,340
Its her.

163
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,340
Noobs should be aware of legends.

164
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:09,341
Shut up you mental.

165
00:21:09,591 --> 00:21:11,840
Look at you, Chocolate on your face,
fish in your hand..

166
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,340
You are the mental one of us.

167
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,542
Oh god, did I call you mental?

168
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,841
So sorry for undermining you.
You deserve godly curses.

169
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,049
Don't feel bad.

170
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:28,325
God, such a drama queen.

171
00:21:29,074 --> 00:21:30,754
Are you getting angry?

172
00:21:31,076 --> 00:21:35,824
You slapped me taking me for someone else.

173
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:38,255
I don't even know who you are?

174
00:21:39,575 --> 00:21:43,536
Hmm,
do stray dogs need a reason to bite people?

175
00:21:44,327 --> 00:21:47,075
Yeah, stray dogs don't need
a reason to bark as well.

176
00:21:49,595 --> 00:21:51,293
Heyy! Where are you going?

177
00:21:51,595 --> 00:21:55,819
- To check the lift sir.
- We can take care of it. Don't go there.

178
00:21:56,043 --> 00:21:59,245
Its nerve wracking not knowing
which corner another bomb is planted.

179
00:21:59,296 --> 00:22:02,816
- Listen to me sir.
- Don't interfere. Go to your duty.

180
00:22:02,992 --> 00:22:04,992
- Sir, please..
- Just leave.

181
00:22:08,046 --> 00:22:09,046
- Gangadhar where are you?

182
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:13,632
You have to be at the spot with seniors.
- I am checking the elevator sir.

183
00:22:13,882 --> 00:22:15,633
Mall security will take care of the lift.

184
00:22:15,758 --> 00:22:19,758
You need to be here to evacuate the place.
We need you here. Come soon.

185
00:22:19,966 --> 00:22:21,467
Okay sir. I'll be there.

186
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:26,633
Hello. Is anybody there? Hello!

187
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,590
Please! Security! Open the doors.

188
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:45,841
Security.
- Oh lord.

189
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:48,341
Hello. Anybody here?
- Oh Princess is crying for help.

190
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:51,592
Stewards are waiting outside
for your orders to respond.

191
00:22:52,095 --> 00:22:56,144
Just shut up.
You'll be behind bars after I go outside.

192
00:22:57,446 --> 00:23:00,346
Hello. First you get out of here vampire.

193
00:23:03,144 --> 00:23:07,497
You are such a stress buster Sunny.

194
00:23:07,895 --> 00:23:10,548
If not for you, my brain would get fried.

195
00:23:10,646 --> 00:23:11,646
Very difficult to handle.

196
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:13,646
Hello. Is anyone outside.

197
00:23:14,642 --> 00:23:16,894
- Is anyone outside?

198
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:18,896
- Is anyone outside?

199
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:20,744
- Is anyone outside?

200
00:23:21,396 --> 00:23:22,145
- Is anyone outside.?

201
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:31,693
Try crying in local language first,
then try national languages.

202
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:34,145
That might help us better.

203
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:36,076
Are you annoyed?

204
00:23:37,644 --> 00:23:40,143
Helloo. Anyone there?

205
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:45,841
REPORTER - Today at uppal mall,
a bomb blast took place.

206
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:52,091
There were no casualities since
the bomb blasted in a corner.

207
00:23:52,383 --> 00:23:54,633
But there was some collateral damage.

208
00:23:54,882 --> 00:24:00,634
Security has evacuated the entire mall
safely. Mall is temporarily shutdown.

209
00:24:00,883 --> 00:24:04,634
Investigation is on track.

210
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:26,893
Heck.

211
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:38,892
Oh lord.

212
00:25:14,293 --> 00:25:18,646
It feels like begging for
money by distributing pamplets.

213
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:23,294
HELP!

214
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:24,395
HELP!

215
00:25:24,595 --> 00:25:26,275
Can someone please help.

216
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,123
Mom, why do you like bangles so much?

217
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:35,645
- Not liking, I was mad crazy about them.

218
00:25:35,796 --> 00:25:42,344
Bangles and Flowers were always
my company when I was with your dad.

219
00:25:42,645 --> 00:25:45,894
This time around,
I will get bangles for you.

220
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:07,797
Wah. Audience might've lost their
mind seeing your bangles idea.

221
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:15,146
Bro, did you ever imagine
what would a lady Einstein do?

222
00:26:19,397 --> 00:26:20,796
This is all because of you.

223
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:27,994
Can't you do something to get out of
here rather than doing commentary.

224
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:32,146
Uh huh!

225
00:26:45,693 --> 00:26:47,293
Thanks for the beat.

226
00:27:07,396 --> 00:27:12,145
Hey! Honeybee eyed, Fishy thorned lady..
why the agitation..

227
00:27:12,245 --> 00:27:16,896
Hey! Don't explode around
when I speak the truth..

228
00:27:17,197 --> 00:27:22,394
Your beauty doesn't make you special..
come down a few steps.

229
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:27,893
Your beauty is miniscule,
compared to entire universe.

230
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:33,646
Hey! Honeybee eyed, Fishy thorned lady..
why the agitation.

231
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,398
Hey! Don't explode around
when I speak the truth..

232
00:27:49,894 --> 00:27:52,146
Lord of creation didn't do a mistake..

233
00:27:52,393 --> 00:27:54,799
He took a lot away for your beauty.

234
00:27:55,147 --> 00:28:00,195
Mask called Face is not of much value.
Listen to me, don't go by it.

235
00:28:00,894 --> 00:28:05,399
Whoever marries you,
goes from fry pan to fire.

236
00:28:05,897 --> 00:28:10,397
Real beauty is on the inside.
Have a look inside.

237
00:28:10,894 --> 00:28:16,395
You wouldn't forgive a mirror,
if it goes heavy when you look at it.

238
00:28:16,396 --> 00:28:18,893
You go in search of
praise in the morning..

239
00:28:18,993 --> 00:28:21,547
..otherwise you can't wake up.

240
00:28:21,795 --> 00:28:26,893
I wouldn't bargain when
I am speaking the truth.

241
00:28:26,993 --> 00:28:32,394
Love with beauty is an ailment,
better don't go there.

242
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:48,148
Hey! Honeybee eyed, Fishy thorned lady..
why the agitation.

243
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:53,399
Hey! Don't explode around
when I speak the truth..

244
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:58,647
Your beauty doesn't make you special..
come down a few steps.

245
00:28:58,894 --> 00:29:03,902
Your beauty is miniscule,
compared to entire universe.

246
00:30:34,143 --> 00:30:35,123
What is it now?

247
00:30:35,144 --> 00:30:37,793
Go bang the door until
what you ate is digested.

248
00:30:39,243 --> 00:30:40,496
I should bang the hell out of you.

249
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:44,035
Do you recall why you slapped
me in the first place.

250
00:30:44,797 --> 00:30:49,795
Recall?
I was fully aware of what I was doing.

251
00:30:49,895 --> 00:30:56,446
I intentionally followed you
and consciously slapped you.

252
00:30:56,546 --> 00:30:57,546
But why?

253
00:30:58,047 --> 00:30:58,997
What the heck have I done to you?

254
00:31:00,148 --> 00:31:03,396
- Didn't you come here by a auto?
- So?

255
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,795
- Will you slap me for coming by an auto?

256
00:31:04,898 --> 00:31:07,765
You moron.
This Fish has better brains than you.

257
00:31:07,894 --> 00:31:10,394
- Is it true?

258
00:31:12,895 --> 00:31:15,147
While coming here,
you almost hit an old man.

259
00:31:15,245 --> 00:31:16,245
What did you yell at him?

260
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:23,745
You didn't have a minimum courtesy
of letting an old man cross the road.

261
00:31:23,796 --> 00:31:25,297
Instead you were shouting at him.

262
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,180
- Grandpa. Are you okay?

263
00:31:27,195 --> 00:31:30,895
Why are you roaming on
roads when you are blind.

264
00:31:31,894 --> 00:31:35,397
He is my Grandpa.
He brought us up like a Mother.

265
00:31:36,648 --> 00:31:41,395
How can I tolerate such an act upon him.

266
00:31:42,646 --> 00:31:45,093
- Did you slap me for that?
- What do you mean?

267
00:31:46,397 --> 00:31:49,647
If that's your reason,
I will have to slap you twice.

268
00:31:50,146 --> 00:31:52,097
At whom do you think I was shouting at?

269
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:58,348
Sorry.

270
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:05,179
Why are you roaming on
roads when you are blind.

271
00:32:07,473 --> 00:32:09,722
- Why are you driving rashly?
- Jai Mahesha.

272
00:32:10,213 --> 00:32:16,430
Auto guy took off quickly,
so I couldn't come and apologise.

273
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,932
Story, narration and performance.
You pulled it off well.

274
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:22,644
Hello. Excuse me. I am not so cheap.

275
00:32:23,394 --> 00:32:27,897
I would never disrespect elders.
My mom raised me well.

276
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:32,496
I said sorry then and there.
You can confirm it with the lady with you.

277
00:32:32,647 --> 00:32:38,396
I don't know the relation of that lady
with you. But she will vouch for me.

278
00:32:41,184 --> 00:32:42,094
To sis?

279
00:32:53,496 --> 00:32:55,046
Forgive me for what happened.

280
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,681
Its already too late.

281
00:33:46,181 --> 00:33:47,831
My mom would be worried about me.

282
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:51,936
I feel some lift fuse must have gone off.

283
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:54,182
They should've solved the issue by now.

284
00:33:54,881 --> 00:33:57,382
If we bang the doors hard,
security guard might come our way.

285
00:33:58,088 --> 00:33:58,837
Please help.

286
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:05,131
You are talking as if you've
come to your friends place.

287
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,878
I don't think you
understood what's going on.

288
00:34:08,132 --> 00:34:11,396
If a fuse goes off,
lift will not behave like this.

289
00:34:12,779 --> 00:34:15,879
You've been banging the door for an hr.
Not a single person has come for rescue.

290
00:34:16,632 --> 00:34:21,034
From the moment we came, Police are
roaming around with sniffer dogs.

291
00:34:21,382 --> 00:34:23,781
I guess, it could be a bomb blast.

292
00:34:26,132 --> 00:34:29,630
We don't know the blast intensity,
since we are in basement.

293
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:32,128
Bomb!

294
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:33,129
A bomb blast?

295
00:34:34,381 --> 00:34:37,878
Don't be so analytical.
You are speaking dangerously.

296
00:34:38,131 --> 00:34:41,680
Come on.
Fearing will not make facts false.

297
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:45,381
I think my guess is right.

298
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:50,530
I've seen news about this
report from Intelligence report.

299
00:34:51,781 --> 00:34:52,730
I don't think you are right.

300
00:34:53,281 --> 00:34:55,278
You know what. You really look beautiful.

301
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:02,577
Tell me something about
myself that I don't know.

302
00:35:02,778 --> 00:35:04,731
You really have peanut brains.

303
00:35:05,828 --> 00:35:06,928
You are such a jerk.

304
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,644
It is said that beauty with
brains is a rare thing.

305
00:35:12,133 --> 00:35:13,133
OH GOD!

306
00:35:14,635 --> 00:35:18,382
Do you really realize where and in
what kind of condition we are stuck.

307
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:20,629
Relax!

308
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:24,932
We didn't do much sitting
at home during lockdown.

309
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:32,130
Same applies here. We can't do a thing apart
from sitting here and munching popcorn.

310
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:37,384
You and I are locked in a lift.

311
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:38,381
BOOM!

312
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,930
And here goes off a Bomb.

313
00:35:49,882 --> 00:35:55,580
Men can't help but exploit a situation
when they are stuck with a beautiful girl.

314
00:35:56,628 --> 00:36:01,281
Women can't help but speak off their beauty
irrespective of the situation they are in.

315
00:36:01,787 --> 00:36:06,031
You said its a blast, lift is off.
Aren't you scared a bit?

316
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:07,131
Not a bit.

317
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,149
Otherwise are you showing off?

318
00:36:34,132 --> 00:36:36,632
Is she is in vibration mode?

319
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:38,880
What's happening?

320
00:36:49,882 --> 00:36:50,382
Help!

321
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,131
Security!

322
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:53,529
HELP!

323
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,558
- Hey!
- Anybody there?

324
00:36:56,129 --> 00:36:57,169
Hello Madam.

325
00:36:58,082 --> 00:36:59,282
Oh Miss India.

326
00:36:59,632 --> 00:37:01,627
What are you trying to do?
Get out of your act.

327
00:37:02,728 --> 00:37:05,828
You think you will be saved
if you just shout loud.

328
00:37:05,928 --> 00:37:07,368
Control yourself.

329
00:37:07,878 --> 00:37:10,178
I drank 5 glasses of cane juice.

330
00:37:10,385 --> 00:37:11,385
How can I control it?

331
00:37:17,878 --> 00:37:18,978
I know its difficult.

332
00:37:19,382 --> 00:37:22,628
An hour or two is controllable.

333
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:24,128
A Day or two is impossible.

334
00:37:31,978 --> 00:37:34,377
Being stressed will increase pressure.

335
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:36,945
Peace is the only way. Just relax.

336
00:37:37,528 --> 00:37:38,578
So be cool.

337
00:37:38,878 --> 00:37:42,628
Why can't I control cane juice.

338
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,028
Its all my fate.

339
00:37:45,427 --> 00:37:48,084
God! Please save me.

340
00:37:48,628 --> 00:37:49,678
See.

341
00:37:51,378 --> 00:37:53,627
Agitation will only increase the pressure.

342
00:37:54,378 --> 00:37:57,128
Like I said.
Just sit on this stool and relax.

343
00:37:59,078 --> 00:38:02,078
Just feel the pleasure. Not the pressure.

344
00:38:02,132 --> 00:38:03,130
Wah!

345
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:04,628
What a rhythm?

346
00:38:08,677 --> 00:38:09,879
Manforce Condoms.

347
00:38:10,428 --> 00:38:12,628
Just feel the pleasure. Not the pressure.

348
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:16,378
Wohoo. Punchline fits here also.

349
00:38:16,978 --> 00:38:18,128
So crazy no!

350
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,130
Sorry!

351
00:38:31,502 --> 00:38:32,355
Want this?

352
00:38:36,056 --> 00:38:37,503
Now open and relish it.

353
00:38:42,805 --> 00:38:45,056
Your plight is also the same
as this Coke tin. Right?

354
00:39:03,653 --> 00:39:04,609
Lucky tin.

355
00:39:05,754 --> 00:39:08,053
I am laughing out of helplessness.

356
00:39:08,104 --> 00:39:15,455
You don't know how it is for a girl when her
bladder is full and stuck with a stranger.

357
00:39:24,303 --> 00:39:27,055
If you don't mind. I have an idea.

358
00:39:29,856 --> 00:39:31,554
I don't mind. Please tell me.

359
00:39:31,756 --> 00:39:37,655
If you agree, I can pee in my pants.

360
00:39:40,554 --> 00:39:44,053
I'm sorry. What the heck am I talking?

361
00:39:45,803 --> 00:39:48,054
That's okay. I can understand.

362
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:01,303
Adult diapers. Bought 'em for my grandpa.

363
00:40:02,808 --> 00:40:06,056
If you are okay. You can use them..

364
00:40:08,056 --> 00:40:09,055
What?

365
00:40:09,505 --> 00:40:10,555
Here?

366
00:40:11,804 --> 00:40:14,054
Do you have any other option?

367
00:41:11,806 --> 00:41:12,807
- Feeling better?

368
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,733
- Thank you so much!

369
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:19,807
Solutions come along with problems.
I guess that's the divine plan.

370
00:41:21,155 --> 00:41:25,254
So, the solution to get outta
here is somewhere here only.

371
00:41:25,304 --> 00:41:26,304
- Maybe.

372
00:41:30,552 --> 00:41:33,506
Your grandpa? Diapers?

373
00:41:34,703 --> 00:41:37,305
He has BPH issues.

374
00:41:38,303 --> 00:41:40,561
Actually,
my entire life is surrounded by him.

375
00:41:41,552 --> 00:41:42,654
Its very clear for me.

376
00:41:43,304 --> 00:41:44,603
Its his birthday tomorrow.

377
00:41:45,053 --> 00:41:47,053
This shopping is all for that.

378
00:41:47,808 --> 00:41:49,107
Tomorrow its my birthday also.

379
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:51,110
Is it?
- What a coincidence.

380
00:41:52,303 --> 00:41:55,054
So, you had to present me his gift.

381
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,306
Come on. Who gifts diapers.

382
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,953
I was just kidding. I'm sorry.

383
00:42:02,303 --> 00:42:05,205
This is his gift.

384
00:42:05,802 --> 00:42:08,854
I got a watch when I got
distinction in boards.

385
00:42:09,052 --> 00:42:12,056
I sold that watch and bought him a guitar.

386
00:42:13,302 --> 00:42:18,904
I don't mind getting injured.
I can't take if anything happens to this.

387
00:42:20,055 --> 00:42:21,207
- Is he a guitar player?

388
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,552
Maestro Illayaraja..

389
00:42:26,106 --> 00:42:27,505
Is Illayaraja your grandpa?

390
00:42:29,205 --> 00:42:30,560
You can't stop yourself. Do you?

391
00:42:31,555 --> 00:42:31,805
Sorry.

392
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:35,805
Illayaraja and my grandpa
got trained with same master.

393
00:42:36,003 --> 00:42:41,054
My grandpa couldn't become a composer
becuase his father didn't support him.

394
00:42:42,554 --> 00:42:45,054
- Its the genes I guess.
- I got the same madness for music.

395
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:48,056
Now my grandpa supports me.

396
00:42:48,671 --> 00:42:49,791
You got lucky.

397
00:42:50,555 --> 00:42:51,902
How about you?

398
00:42:52,556 --> 00:42:54,804
Are you entering Ms. World competition?

399
00:42:56,305 --> 00:42:57,305
Its enough already.

400
00:42:57,602 --> 00:43:01,159
I wanna be a playback singer.
- Nice

401
00:43:02,105 --> 00:43:05,854
But enemy that stops me from
becoming a singer is always with me.

402
00:43:06,404 --> 00:43:07,906
- I didn't get you.

403
00:43:08,405 --> 00:43:09,405
I have Asthma.

404
00:43:11,102 --> 00:43:16,703
Everytime I show up for an audition,
my asthma comes along and ruins it.

405
00:43:17,305 --> 00:43:18,605
It wouldn't let me sing at all.

406
00:43:20,105 --> 00:43:23,553
It completely shattered my dreams.

407
00:43:23,605 --> 00:43:28,655
All I want is to record a
single and send to music labels.

408
00:43:29,302 --> 00:43:30,704
But it seems impossible for me.

409
00:43:31,055 --> 00:43:34,351
Oh. So that's why you
are taking this fish.

410
00:43:34,805 --> 00:43:35,672
- What do you mean?

411
00:43:36,173 --> 00:43:40,206
There's a treatment. You stuff the fish with
medicine and you stuff yourself with the fish.

412
00:43:40,303 --> 00:43:42,672
- You idiot. Stop it.

413
00:43:42,904 --> 00:43:44,354
No way. Its a pet.

414
00:43:44,803 --> 00:43:45,455
Oh ok.

415
00:43:45,702 --> 00:43:49,253
There's a Heroine at home,
waiting for this Hero.

416
00:43:49,255 --> 00:43:52,103
I wonder who's waiting for me.
Tamanna or Tapsee.

417
00:43:54,104 --> 00:43:54,854
Oh shit.

418
00:43:55,555 --> 00:43:59,304
I forgot.
This needs to be in aquarium within 4 hrs.

419
00:43:59,557 --> 00:44:01,755
There won't be much oxygen after 4hrs.

420
00:44:01,801 --> 00:44:03,456
What do we do now?

421
00:44:03,553 --> 00:44:06,802
Oh my god! Will I be gone after 30 mins.

422
00:44:06,902 --> 00:44:09,956
Please do something and save me.

423
00:44:10,156 --> 00:44:11,456
I completely forgot about this.

424
00:44:12,056 --> 00:44:13,455
You are such a beauty.

425
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:19,052
Why do you have to worry about everything.

426
00:44:19,252 --> 00:44:22,202
Its your words.
Problem and Solution go along together.

427
00:44:22,605 --> 00:44:23,605
Wait.

428
00:44:26,805 --> 00:44:27,858
Voila!

429
00:44:28,803 --> 00:44:29,805
- Ashtray?

430
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:44,457
- Wohoo. An ashtray saved my life.
- Kudos guys.

431
00:44:45,052 --> 00:44:45,957
- Thank you.

432
00:44:46,053 --> 00:44:47,055
Enough with the Thanks.

433
00:44:47,155 --> 00:44:48,605
Do you intend to say your name now.

434
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:50,692
- I'm sorry.
- My name is Sameerana.

435
00:44:50,755 --> 00:44:53,254
- Saa mee raa na.
- That's a lovely name.

436
00:44:53,554 --> 00:44:54,554
- Thank you.

437
00:44:54,603 --> 00:44:55,723
- I am Pavan.

438
00:44:56,203 --> 00:44:58,856
- My name is Gabbar Singh.

439
00:45:03,355 --> 00:45:05,356
Sameerana translates to Breath.

440
00:45:05,601 --> 00:45:07,281
Pavan translates to Wind.

441
00:45:07,853 --> 00:45:11,656
That means for you to breath,
I am necessary.

442
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:17,104
But in my dictionary,
Pavan translates to Power.

443
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:22,706
Time seems to be 8.
Can't we get outta here?

444
00:45:23,402 --> 00:45:27,652
Mobile reception is completely dead.

445
00:45:32,906 --> 00:45:34,854
My mom would be worried about me.

446
00:45:36,005 --> 00:45:37,005
Relax!

447
00:45:37,176 --> 00:45:40,422
Lets hope some security guy shows up.

448
00:45:40,672 --> 00:45:42,172
We might get out of here.

449
00:45:42,424 --> 00:45:43,672
So, Just chill.

450
00:45:44,422 --> 00:45:45,422
Chill?

451
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,686
You can chill drinking beer
at a beach on full moon night.

452
00:45:49,886 --> 00:45:54,435
Can you chill eating pepper
fritters on a sunny day.

453
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:57,936
Woah! You seem to have too many fantasies.

454
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:02,185
Can you share your fantasies for fun.

455
00:46:04,185 --> 00:46:05,236
Oh!

456
00:46:06,936 --> 00:46:11,936
Just for fun.
We have all the time in the world.

457
00:46:12,591 --> 00:46:17,046
You seem to get a kick out off
knowing about girl's fantasies.

458
00:46:18,143 --> 00:46:20,792
You seem to make me
agree about your beauty.

459
00:46:20,995 --> 00:46:21,995
Sorry?

460
00:46:22,245 --> 00:46:24,094
- Nothing.
- Yes it thrills me.

461
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:30,493
So.
- Roll. Camera. Action.

462
00:46:33,444 --> 00:46:33,992
Okay.

463
00:46:34,994 --> 00:46:37,393
This is a long wishing fantasy.

464
00:46:42,245 --> 00:46:44,145
- Sitting on a stylish bike.

465
00:46:45,793 --> 00:46:47,726
- Enjoying a nice ghat ride.

466
00:46:48,295 --> 00:46:48,995
- Uh huh.

467
00:46:49,494 --> 00:46:53,743
Get down at a less crowded
road side tea shop.

468
00:46:58,796 --> 00:47:02,543
A boy comes from the shop
comes and asks what I need.

469
00:47:02,743 --> 00:47:03,743
- Bro, get me a cutting chai.

470
00:47:07,294 --> 00:47:09,494
- Why did you come into my fantasy?

471
00:47:09,794 --> 00:47:10,496
Where am I in it?

472
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:13,546
I can hear guitar sound in the background.

473
00:47:14,144 --> 00:47:17,443
- Oh is it.
- Okay. I'll get out of your fantasy.

474
00:47:17,995 --> 00:47:18,496
- Its okay. You can stay.

475
00:47:19,247 --> 00:47:21,296
- Vibes are good. You can stay.

476
00:47:23,705 --> 00:47:30,700
After the boy goes to get Tea,
I'll take out a cigar from the pockets.

477
00:47:31,746 --> 00:47:37,995
- I'll light up a matchstick.. NO
- I'll light up with a lighter..

478
00:47:38,496 --> 00:47:45,147
..drag a puff. Meanwhile, hot tea is
being made with Elaichi and Ginger.

479
00:47:46,495 --> 00:47:54,517
I take the chai... one sip of
chai and one puff of cigarette...

480
00:47:55,796 --> 00:47:57,891
..enjoying the nature view along.

481
00:48:00,451 --> 00:48:02,131
After the last puff..

482
00:48:02,494 --> 00:48:06,795
..then drop the filter on
ground and stamp on it.

483
00:48:07,648 --> 00:48:09,515
I am at my utmost relaxed mode.

484
00:48:10,342 --> 00:48:11,148
Here's the tray.

485
00:48:12,249 --> 00:48:17,648
Then sit on my bike,
and start my ride again.

486
00:48:24,995 --> 00:48:25,495
Wah!

487
00:48:26,243 --> 00:48:27,243
- What a fantasy!

488
00:48:27,749 --> 00:48:31,745
Its just out of the world.
Bike, Cigar.. Wah!

489
00:48:33,393 --> 00:48:38,994
A Fantasy can be what you want to do
or something you can't do but want to.

490
00:48:39,094 --> 00:48:40,245
- What kind is yours?

491
00:48:40,892 --> 00:48:42,546
- Something I want to but can't.

492
00:48:42,746 --> 00:48:43,746
- Why so?

493
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,596
- Smoke and Asthma don't go well at all.

494
00:48:45,943 --> 00:48:48,944
Let it be.
- What about your fantasies?

495
00:48:50,995 --> 00:48:52,545
Let's avoid my fantasies.

496
00:49:08,592 --> 00:49:09,243
- What happened?

497
00:49:09,451 --> 00:49:12,244
Nothing.
Better get rid of those stupid acts.

498
00:49:12,793 --> 00:49:13,742
What?

499
00:49:16,242 --> 00:49:19,345
Lets end it here and
come back to reality.

500
00:49:20,092 --> 00:49:22,994
I am famished.
Looks like you have bought a lot.

501
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:24,845
Can you give me something to eat.

502
00:49:24,944 --> 00:49:27,245
- Yeah. Thanks for reminding.

503
00:49:27,746 --> 00:49:29,446
I completely forgot.

504
00:49:39,993 --> 00:49:40,746
Poor fish.

505
00:49:41,993 --> 00:49:45,294
- Haha. Pavan must be burning of hunger.

506
00:49:52,394 --> 00:49:54,745
- What is it Pavan? You seem to be off.

507
00:49:55,494 --> 00:49:57,242
What happened?
- Nothing.

508
00:49:57,746 --> 00:49:58,741
Hey Pavan.

509
00:49:58,795 --> 00:49:59,995
I know you are hungry.

510
00:50:00,694 --> 00:50:03,843
Only you can prank me all the time.
Isn't it?

511
00:50:05,743 --> 00:50:09,395
Come on. I have enough for a full dinner.

512
00:50:10,496 --> 00:50:15,495
Actually, I have a trip planned
with my friends this evening.

513
00:50:16,743 --> 00:50:19,246
All this shopping is for that.

514
00:50:20,146 --> 00:50:21,993
I am supposed to be on a flight now.

515
00:50:21,995 --> 00:50:24,195
- But here I am, stuck in a lift.

516
00:50:48,996 --> 00:50:50,545
Oh s***!
- What happened?

517
00:50:51,343 --> 00:50:53,493
- Power is gone I guess.

518
00:50:53,796 --> 00:50:56,993
- Its been a battery light all this while.

519
00:50:57,494 --> 00:50:58,244
- How do we do now?

520
00:50:58,246 --> 00:50:59,650
Mobile light it is.

521
00:51:02,445 --> 00:51:03,495
Mobilee.

522
00:51:08,745 --> 00:51:09,747
Oh god.

523
00:51:13,544 --> 00:51:13,893
One second.

524
00:51:22,892 --> 00:51:24,246
Nice job.
- Isn't it?

525
00:51:24,295 --> 00:51:25,735
- Its really good.

526
00:51:30,742 --> 00:51:33,495
Here we go. Do you like some wine?

527
00:51:34,994 --> 00:51:38,293
Uh Ohh. You guys seem to
have planned it really well.

528
00:51:39,246 --> 00:51:40,795
- Why should only boys have all the fun.

529
00:51:42,397 --> 00:51:44,996
Are you ok with vital brand?

530
00:51:45,245 --> 00:51:48,296
- Haha. Brand doesn't bother me.

531
00:51:57,445 --> 00:51:57,996
WoW!

532
00:51:59,245 --> 00:52:00,745
Mobile light turned to Moon light.

533
00:52:02,544 --> 00:52:04,395
And what a lovely and romantic night.

534
00:52:04,893 --> 00:52:06,393
Our guy seems like a bachelor.

535
00:52:08,243 --> 00:52:12,241
Am I risking anything by offering
him wine in this situation.

536
00:52:14,743 --> 00:52:19,400
Hello. Is offering me wine concerning you?

537
00:52:21,745 --> 00:52:23,743
Your face is very evident.

538
00:52:25,495 --> 00:52:27,145
These kind of things
shouldn't bother you at all.

539
00:52:28,592 --> 00:52:32,745
A single glass will make earth look
like merry-go-round for ladies.

540
00:52:33,645 --> 00:52:38,947
Even if I bottoms up this entire bottle,
its like a few drops.

541
00:52:39,995 --> 00:52:40,744
So, don't worry.

542
00:52:41,395 --> 00:52:45,694
Whatever we do now will not
make you repent in the morning.

543
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,396
I'm good. I understood.

544
00:52:48,392 --> 00:52:49,041
Lets enjoy!

545
00:52:49,044 --> 00:52:50,196
Now we are on track.

546
00:52:50,995 --> 00:52:54,244
I'll tweak your idea a bit,
it will be a game changer.

547
00:53:09,894 --> 00:53:11,245
You aced it.

548
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:16,547
You settle here buddy.

549
00:53:27,492 --> 00:53:28,244
So what's next?

550
00:53:29,046 --> 00:53:29,746
- Wine.

551
00:53:30,296 --> 00:53:31,750
- Our guy is in a haste.

552
00:53:31,995 --> 00:53:33,495
Can you please pass on my guitar?

553
00:54:11,042 --> 00:54:16,345
Sparkling pearls, shining laughs.

554
00:54:18,242 --> 00:54:21,243
Sparkling pearls, shining laughs.

555
00:54:21,343 --> 00:54:24,416
To which melody is my heart listening.

556
00:54:24,616 --> 00:54:28,142
Looks like a dream,
but feels like reality..

557
00:54:28,246 --> 00:54:31,494
Verbal chaos is out of my lips.

558
00:54:38,744 --> 00:54:41,747
Procession bore by darkness..

559
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:45,395
Fireflies are chatting..

560
00:54:45,793 --> 00:54:48,745
Beads of fancies strung together..

561
00:54:48,992 --> 00:54:52,495
My heart can't recall the name.

562
00:54:59,643 --> 00:55:06,245
Now and then there are
shining presents in my eyes.

563
00:55:06,493 --> 00:55:12,750
Not knowing the dizziness
my feet are dancing.

564
00:55:17,049 --> 00:55:19,041
Oh my heart!

565
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:22,994
you are a firefly.

566
00:55:24,049 --> 00:55:26,045
Oh my heart!

567
00:55:26,145 --> 00:55:29,991
you are a firefly.

568
00:55:31,143 --> 00:55:32,994
Oh my heart!

569
00:55:33,094 --> 00:55:36,745
you are a firefly.

570
00:55:37,492 --> 00:55:39,746
Oh my heart!

571
00:55:39,997 --> 00:55:43,898
You are a firefly.

572
00:55:59,494 --> 00:56:05,744
To know where Raindrop is created..

573
00:56:06,243 --> 00:56:12,945
..lets go to the laps of clouds.

574
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:19,992
To know where a wave starts..

575
00:56:19,995 --> 00:56:26,245
lets read the story in breeze.

576
00:56:40,241 --> 00:56:43,744
Before I know its me..

577
00:56:43,795 --> 00:56:47,241
My thoughts steal the moment.

578
00:57:01,144 --> 00:57:07,701
The world is upside down,
asking for help..

579
00:57:08,246 --> 00:57:14,992
I wouldn't leave you, says shining moon.

580
00:57:49,746 --> 00:57:50,743
Pavan.

581
00:57:50,793 --> 00:57:57,555
You said earth will be go merry-go-round.

582
00:57:57,775 --> 00:58:00,134
But you've taken me to another planet.

583
00:58:24,394 --> 00:58:27,745
Battery is about to die.
I will switch off the mobile.

584
00:58:28,745 --> 00:58:30,996
You look sleepy. Sleep well.

585
00:58:40,495 --> 00:58:41,495
Ahh!

586
00:58:41,993 --> 00:58:44,226
Hey.. what are you doing?

587
00:58:45,745 --> 00:58:47,265
- No.
- Sameerana..

588
00:58:47,344 --> 00:58:50,093
- You Idiot.
- Pavan take your hands off me.

589
00:58:51,193 --> 00:58:53,244
Get away. Take off your hands.

590
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:43,499
- I am really sorry Pavan.

591
00:59:45,296 --> 00:59:46,048
I'm so sorry.

592
00:59:48,296 --> 00:59:54,044
Just when I was sleeping,I was worried
there was something on my chest.

593
00:59:55,997 --> 00:59:57,549
I thought it was you.

594
00:59:58,947 --> 01:00:01,296
How can we expect a rat here suddenly.

595
01:00:04,346 --> 01:00:08,049
I can understand its embarrasing for you.

596
01:00:09,352 --> 01:00:12,798
But I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

597
01:00:13,545 --> 01:00:16,700
Pavan, please don't be serious.

598
01:00:21,695 --> 01:00:28,048
Relationships mean a lot to me.
They are both my strength and weakness.

599
01:00:29,198 --> 01:00:34,095
I would never misbehave with a girl.
I am not that cheap.

600
01:00:36,548 --> 01:00:40,049
It doesn't hurt me for
slapping me by mistake.

601
01:00:41,999 --> 01:00:44,551
I can't be hurt for this
especially with you.

602
01:00:45,396 --> 01:00:48,446
I also misunderstood you in the morning.

603
01:00:49,299 --> 01:00:52,196
So, no hard feelings.

604
01:00:54,045 --> 01:01:01,797
You seem to be angry outside,but on the
inside you are ego less and clean hearted.

605
01:01:03,299 --> 01:01:08,295
You are not a stranger to me anymore.
I trust you with all my heart.

606
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:11,798
I completely trust you Pavan.

607
01:01:16,448 --> 01:01:17,496
Good night!

608
01:01:48,447 --> 01:01:49,546
Oh my god!

609
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:51,599
WoW.

610
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:53,238
Happy Birthday Sameerana!

611
01:01:55,846 --> 01:01:57,402
Thank you so much!

612
01:01:58,497 --> 01:02:00,394
This is totally unexpected.

613
01:02:01,395 --> 01:02:04,898
So far in my life,
there's been only 2 big surprises.

614
01:02:05,446 --> 01:02:06,900
Both happened today itself.

615
01:02:06,997 --> 01:02:09,748
At 12 afternoon, you slapped me.

616
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:16,054
Now at 12, you are celebrating
my birthday here in this lift.

617
01:02:17,147 --> 01:02:22,148
I wouldn't be this thrilled if I
were with my friends in Kerala.

618
01:02:23,098 --> 01:02:27,146
If I were featured on Femina cover page.

619
01:02:27,695 --> 01:02:30,647
If I got 1 mil. likes on Facebook.

620
01:02:31,397 --> 01:02:33,399
I wouldn't be this excited.

621
01:02:42,894 --> 01:02:43,898
My Grace!

622
01:02:47,554 --> 01:02:48,402
Thank you.

623
01:03:02,196 --> 01:03:03,446
Its all good. Go ahead.

624
01:03:04,996 --> 01:03:07,253
Happy Birthday to you.

625
01:03:08,597 --> 01:03:11,153
Happy Birthday to you.

626
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:39,648
Sameerana.

627
01:03:40,796 --> 01:03:42,396
Can you give me your phone.

628
01:05:18,198 --> 01:05:20,396
You said you didn't have a
single recording of yours.

629
01:05:21,147 --> 01:05:23,151
This is your first and best recording.

630
01:05:23,896 --> 01:05:27,202
I wish and know that you will
achieve your dream this year.

631
01:05:29,651 --> 01:05:32,648
You got gift that are worth my life time.

632
01:05:33,898 --> 01:05:35,899
I will remember this birthday forever.

633
01:05:55,495 --> 01:05:58,848
This cake was for your grandpa. Right?

634
01:05:59,349 --> 01:06:01,149
Why did you use it for me.

635
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:04,400
I can't celebrate his birthday anyway.

636
01:06:05,246 --> 01:06:09,249
Atleast your birthday is on the same day.
I am happy.

637
01:06:09,645 --> 01:06:13,396
Still, Cakes bought for our
kin has our emotions in it.

638
01:06:14,149 --> 01:06:18,897
We have our love and care invested in it.

639
01:06:18,948 --> 01:06:19,948
Ohh
- Ohh

640
01:06:23,648 --> 01:06:25,197
Looks like this Rat too has
its delight in this cake.

641
01:06:25,499 --> 01:06:25,898
Bloody..

642
01:06:37,447 --> 01:06:40,796
What are you doing? Why did you cage it?

643
01:06:41,399 --> 01:06:44,098
I am shit scared of Rats.

644
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,646
See these goosebumps.

645
01:06:46,652 --> 01:06:48,919
- Are you scared of rats?
- Haha. Why?

646
01:06:50,296 --> 01:06:53,152
Because of a grievous moment in my life.

647
01:06:53,895 --> 01:06:55,095
What happened?

648
01:06:57,196 --> 01:07:01,646
My grandpa got chocolates from
abroad when I was younger.

649
01:07:02,895 --> 01:07:06,099
My sister ate all of them except one
by the time I came back from school.

650
01:07:06,649 --> 01:07:10,349
I ate half of it and kept the rest
in my pant pocket and slept off.

651
01:07:10,378 --> 01:07:12,397
A Rat ate the rest of the chocolate.

652
01:07:15,649 --> 01:07:19,997
Its fine if it just ate the chocolate,
but it also ate a little of me.

653
01:07:24,398 --> 01:07:26,897
Still,
it doesn't justify you caging it like that.

654
01:07:27,448 --> 01:07:29,097
- Sad for it.
- What? Sad?

655
01:07:29,696 --> 01:07:31,648
You can cage Fish in a bag.

656
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:33,649
Can't we cage rats in boxes?

657
01:07:34,151 --> 01:07:36,394
- Hey, it will be a Pet.

658
01:07:36,494 --> 01:07:37,898
- I want to get rid of it.

659
01:07:39,898 --> 01:07:44,152
I can't take chances letting it free.
Not sure where else it will creep in.

660
01:07:44,398 --> 01:07:45,678
Safety measures.

661
01:07:52,119 --> 01:07:56,621
Mom would be so tensed about me.
I am worried about it.

662
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,120
What about your dad?

663
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:08,624
They got divorced when I was 5.

664
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:11,618
From then, it was just Me and Mom at home.

665
01:08:12,615 --> 01:08:16,373
Mom raised me bold since
there was no men at home.

666
01:08:16,866 --> 01:08:18,865
I get a lot of freedom.

667
01:08:20,269 --> 01:08:22,618
She taught me how to live independently.

668
01:08:23,869 --> 01:08:28,114
All she does is for me and my well being.

669
01:08:29,866 --> 01:08:31,623
Then call her..

670
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:36,161
Tell her you are safe and
a guy named Pavan is along.

671
01:08:48,873 --> 01:08:52,620
Tring Tring Tring Tring
Tring Tring Tring Tring

672
01:08:53,923 --> 01:08:56,366
Samee.. Where are you?
Where have you gone?

673
01:08:56,414 --> 01:08:57,994
You didn't even call.

674
01:08:58,068 --> 01:08:59,115
You phone are unreachable.

675
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:01,868
I'm stressed out because of you.

676
01:09:02,269 --> 01:09:05,373
Mom. I am safe. How are you?

677
01:09:05,564 --> 01:09:07,870
I am in shopping mall. Stuck in a lift.

678
01:09:08,016 --> 01:09:10,817
Don't worry.
I have company, a guy named Pavan.

679
01:09:10,867 --> 01:09:11,867
He's a good guy.

680
01:09:12,867 --> 01:09:15,067
What do you mean stuck in a lift?

681
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:17,119
That too alone with a guy?

682
01:09:17,866 --> 01:09:19,114
Be careful.

683
01:09:19,374 --> 01:09:21,368
You know you can't trust these stupid men.

684
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:27,368
No Mom, its all good here.

685
01:09:27,866 --> 01:09:31,866
He looked like Romeo intially,
turns out he is a bit of Lord Rama.

686
01:09:31,871 --> 01:09:33,614
How did you get stuck in a lift?
Tell me this first..

687
01:09:34,368 --> 01:09:35,873
That guy is the reason for that.

688
01:09:35,918 --> 01:09:39,118
He cornered me in a lift
and slapped me hard.

689
01:09:39,619 --> 01:09:43,169
After a Bomb blast and Power cut.
, we got stuck here.

690
01:09:43,618 --> 01:09:45,616
Oh god! What's wrong with that guy?

691
01:09:45,868 --> 01:09:48,620
How could he slap such a
cute and innocent face.

692
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:50,519
Take care my dear.

693
01:09:50,616 --> 01:09:51,616
We'll send him behind bars
after you get outta there.

694
01:09:53,868 --> 01:09:55,618
Its ok Mom. He is a good guy.

695
01:09:56,024 --> 01:09:57,324
There's no need to send him behind bars.

696
01:09:57,519 --> 01:10:00,369
Ohh.. you are taking sides already.
What's going on?

697
01:10:01,116 --> 01:10:03,368
Hope you guys are not doing
anything impish already.. Right?

698
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:05,368
Shut up!

699
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:14,423
You know a guy needs to be all
time charmer to impress me.

700
01:10:14,873 --> 01:10:16,366
Enough with that.

701
01:10:16,615 --> 01:10:19,870
You never know, you might get a guy
with bald head or stomach pouch.

702
01:10:20,669 --> 01:10:28,374
Such people keep their wall
sized photos all over the home.

703
01:10:44,465 --> 01:10:46,016
Pavan.
- Yeah.

704
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:49,369
Its worrying me,
imagining Mom alone at home.

705
01:10:51,267 --> 01:10:54,115
We have to somehow get outta here.

706
01:10:54,565 --> 01:10:57,623
We don't know how long we
have to sit here like this.

707
01:11:01,622 --> 01:11:04,616
Now it would be very silent outside.

708
01:11:06,116 --> 01:11:09,115
If we can shout harder and bang doors..

709
01:11:09,315 --> 01:11:10,616
someone might hear us.

710
01:11:11,614 --> 01:11:13,269
Shall we try? Please..

711
01:11:15,664 --> 01:11:19,119
Practically speaking these
things doesn't work out.

712
01:11:21,365 --> 01:11:24,115
From how I see,
there won't be a single bird in the mall.

713
01:11:25,465 --> 01:11:26,866
Even I didn't want to
miss Grandpa's birthday.

714
01:11:27,115 --> 01:11:31,366
Still I had no option,
I had to sit quite all this while.

715
01:11:33,618 --> 01:11:36,718
Anyway, why should we not try it..
This could be our way out.

716
01:11:36,865 --> 01:11:39,120
Lets give it a shot..

717
01:11:39,865 --> 01:11:40,865
Okay.
- Lets go.

718
01:11:43,016 --> 01:11:44,296
Ready?
- Ready.

719
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,765
1..2..3..Go

720
01:11:48,265 --> 01:11:49,115
HELPPP!

721
01:11:50,118 --> 01:11:51,558
Is anyone around?

722
01:11:51,615 --> 01:11:53,015
HELPPPPP!

723
01:11:53,215 --> 01:11:54,515

- HELP!

725
01:11:57,618 --> 01:12:00,119
Come on Pavan. Put some force.

726
01:12:00,469 --> 01:12:03,117
Which force?
- Manforce!

727
01:12:04,115 --> 01:12:08,117
Uff..kick these damn doors hard.

728
01:12:08,216 --> 01:12:12,116
You know..
our noise should reach the city.

729
01:12:12,118 --> 01:12:14,217
Got it.. its like you did in the morning?
All languages?

730
01:12:14,316 --> 01:12:16,516
Uhh.. one is enough.

731
01:12:17,617 --> 01:12:19,369
Ok.. our shouting should reach the city.
Right?

732
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:21,618
Yes.
- Now see.. it starts now.

733
01:12:21,718 --> 01:12:22,718
HELP.

734
01:12:23,369 --> 01:12:26,916

HELP!

739
01:12:38,369 --> 01:12:40,874
HELP
- Help please.

740
01:12:45,418 --> 01:12:48,119
HELP
- Is anyone outside?

741
01:12:52,765 --> 01:12:55,865
Let it go., we'll be tired.
We don't even have water.

742
01:12:59,115 --> 01:13:01,118
Hey, come stand this way.

743
01:13:01,368 --> 01:13:04,616
Why?
will you take a runup and kick the door.

744
01:13:04,867 --> 01:13:06,118
That Manforce logo and
you are going so well.

745
01:13:06,368 --> 01:13:06,694
Wait!

746
01:13:09,865 --> 01:13:11,618
You look like a brand
ambassador for Manforce.

747
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:17,319
Ohh.. then you finally agree
that Samee can beat Sunny..

748
01:13:17,466 --> 01:13:18,616
WHAT?

749
01:13:18,964 --> 01:13:20,518
Are you happy about this? Moron.

750
01:13:21,829 --> 01:13:24,584
Hey Pavan. shall we play Truth or Dare?

751
01:13:25,982 --> 01:13:27,833
But with a small twist.

752
01:13:28,329 --> 01:13:31,583
We'll write down,
T for Truth and D for Dare.

753
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:36,583
We'll turn the bottle,
Bottle will decide what to do for us.

754
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,232
Did you understand?

755
01:13:38,954 --> 01:13:45,954
If a Dare comes.. Do you the have
to dare to do whatever I ask.

756
01:13:47,204 --> 01:13:48,204
Of course!

757
01:13:48,954 --> 01:13:50,355
No conditions apply.

758
01:13:52,705 --> 01:13:54,658
Oh god..
Looks like the Wine started working.

759
01:13:54,855 --> 01:13:56,207
Don't overthink it.

760
01:13:56,954 --> 01:13:58,958
Just to pass the time.
Come on, lets start.

761
01:13:59,204 --> 01:14:00,458
Ladies first always.

762
01:14:01,054 --> 01:14:01,758
Okay.

763
01:14:13,755 --> 01:14:16,206
T D T D.

764
01:14:20,786 --> 01:14:22,208
Here we go.

765
01:14:24,203 --> 01:14:25,004
Dare it is.

766
01:14:25,204 --> 01:14:26,724
Fish is in the net.

767
01:14:27,357 --> 01:14:29,107
You moron. Wait for it.

768
01:14:29,306 --> 01:14:31,753
A Rat will come for rescue.

769
01:14:32,008 --> 01:14:33,704
This lady is different species..

770
01:14:33,954 --> 01:14:37,454
So, are you ready for any kind of dare.

771
01:14:37,503 --> 01:14:38,203
Yes.

772
01:14:38,204 --> 01:14:41,104
Think twice before you answer..

773
01:14:41,503 --> 01:14:44,455
You look like the guy in a reality show.

774
01:14:45,003 --> 01:14:48,004
Think twice before you answer..

775
01:14:48,603 --> 01:14:50,204
I already said, I am all up for it.

776
01:14:50,504 --> 01:14:52,705
No conditions apply.

777
01:14:56,507 --> 01:14:59,955
I want to do it now.. here.. with you.

778
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:03,507
Yes, that only.. Starts with S.

779
01:15:05,104 --> 01:15:05,710
What?

780
01:15:06,205 --> 01:15:07,204
Can you dare?

781
01:15:08,353 --> 01:15:09,453
Of course.

782
01:15:09,704 --> 01:15:10,604
I love doing it.

783
01:15:12,604 --> 01:15:15,204
Time and again.. Again and again..

784
01:15:15,454 --> 01:15:17,104
Till I am sweaty and tired.

785
01:15:18,704 --> 01:15:19,453
Lets do it.

786
01:15:20,853 --> 01:15:21,754
S..

787
01:15:22,608 --> 01:15:23,204
I..

788
01:15:23,454 --> 01:15:24,954
N G.

789
01:15:25,458 --> 01:15:26,453
SING.

790
01:15:26,706 --> 01:15:31,609
She pulled it off real smooth.

791
01:15:35,504 --> 01:15:36,711
Let's sing.

792
01:16:14,707 --> 01:16:15,208
Nice.

793
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:19,955
Now your turn.

794
01:16:32,459 --> 01:16:33,209
Hey, its truth.

795
01:16:35,703 --> 01:16:39,754
Come on.
Like they pledge on the Gita and start..

796
01:16:40,205 --> 01:16:41,957
You should speak only the truth.

797
01:16:46,454 --> 01:16:47,408
I Love You.

798
01:16:59,705 --> 01:17:01,457
What? Are you surprised..

799
01:17:03,005 --> 01:17:04,208
This is true Sameerana.

800
01:17:06,704 --> 01:17:09,458
I mean.,
proposals aren't new to me to be surprised.

801
01:17:10,108 --> 01:17:15,103
Obviously, given my beauty..
Proposals aren't a big deal.

802
01:17:15,454 --> 01:17:20,854
But this is first time,
someone made a sincere proposal so fast.

803
01:17:21,404 --> 01:17:24,453
But I have seen you before 3 months.

804
01:17:24,704 --> 01:17:28,454
Indian biggest Swara music
was founded by my grandpa.

805
01:17:30,708 --> 01:17:32,604
You were there for an audition once.

806
01:17:48,704 --> 01:17:53,205
To all the legends and mentors..
I pay my respects..

807
01:17:53,304 --> 01:18:04,203
Bless me to do well and be in one
of these photographs like you.

808
01:18:12,308 --> 01:18:13,211
Okay sir.

809
01:18:14,454 --> 01:18:16,708
Madam, you can go in.

810
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:30,704
Ok Sameerana. You can go for the take.

811
01:19:33,954 --> 01:19:38,454
- What happened? huh..
- What could've happened.

812
01:20:00,453 --> 01:20:01,504
I'm sorry sir.

813
01:20:01,704 --> 01:20:07,454
My asthma is not letting me sing
though you gave me an opportunity.

814
01:20:08,354 --> 01:20:13,255
All you need is Self
belief to overcome asthma.

815
01:20:13,454 --> 01:20:15,957
Your have a good voice miss.

816
01:20:18,508 --> 01:20:20,455
Don't lose your trust.

817
01:20:20,954 --> 01:20:22,704
Don't lose your goal also.

818
01:20:23,204 --> 01:20:25,704
Constant efforts is the key.

819
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:28,104
Better luck next time..

820
01:20:28,654 --> 01:20:29,204
..and take care.

821
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:32,707
Thank you sir.

822
01:20:41,955 --> 01:20:44,458
What., are you laughing at me?

823
01:20:45,706 --> 01:20:49,958
My self belief would be great,
if you blessed me.

824
01:20:50,455 --> 01:20:52,704
I will be a great singer one day.

825
01:20:52,954 --> 01:20:58,705
My young photo will find
its way here among you.

826
01:21:04,353 --> 01:21:05,803
The voice of passion.

827
01:21:19,454 --> 01:21:24,954
Oh.. 10th grade is a
younger for the age you are.

828
01:21:29,604 --> 01:21:30,707
Good Morning sir.
- Morning

829
01:21:31,455 --> 01:21:33,354
Why did that girl leave in tears?

830
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:36,958
She couldn't perform upto
mark due to some issue sir.

831
01:21:39,355 --> 01:21:42,456
But she seems to be talented.

832
01:21:51,354 --> 01:21:53,458
I couldn't even see her face.
- Shit

833
01:22:12,603 --> 01:22:14,205
- Yeah its mine.

834
01:22:14,703 --> 01:22:18,204
I stuck this photo that day.
- Yes, its the same photo.

835
01:22:18,705 --> 01:22:21,708
That day I saw this tattoo on your hand.

836
01:22:21,957 --> 01:22:24,954
When you were giving the bottle,
I saw the same tattoo again.

837
01:22:25,704 --> 01:22:26,953
The voice of passion.

838
01:22:28,757 --> 01:22:30,705
- I liked that stranger lady that day.

839
01:22:31,329 --> 01:22:35,583
I didn't wait for a sec,
when I realized both ladies are same.

840
01:22:37,582 --> 01:22:39,232
That's why.. I couldn't stop my proposal.

841
01:22:42,582 --> 01:22:47,630
From "I hate this guy"
to "I like this guy"..

842
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:51,580
You made it happen in one day.

843
01:22:52,083 --> 01:22:53,830
Whatever be the situation..

844
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:56,463
I changed my diaper infront of a man..

845
01:22:56,832 --> 01:23:04,582
I couldn't even imagine a stranger
celebrating my birthday this grandly..

846
01:23:05,828 --> 01:23:09,930
My only motivation to lead my life.
, is to become a singer.

847
01:23:10,328 --> 01:23:15,735
When I almost lost hope,
you made me sing a song.

848
01:23:22,583 --> 01:23:24,333
You are truly an impressive guy Pavan.

849
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:27,079
But, I don't know..

850
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:32,079
how you got emotionally connected to me.

851
01:23:32,328 --> 01:23:34,883
That's why you couldn't stop
yourself from proposing.

852
01:23:35,332 --> 01:23:36,530
There's nothing wrong with it.

853
01:23:36,829 --> 01:23:39,562
But I should also feel the same for you..

854
01:23:41,673 --> 01:23:43,579
To be impressed and to
connect emotionally..

855
01:23:43,629 --> 01:23:45,309
are two different things.

856
01:23:45,929 --> 01:23:47,080
There will be a moment..

857
01:23:47,229 --> 01:23:51,330
when I can say "He is the one"..

858
01:23:51,429 --> 01:23:54,979
..that I will come and hug
you tight to express my love.

859
01:23:55,228 --> 01:23:57,580
Just like how you did now.

860
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:01,582
I believe in that kind of moment.

861
01:24:02,028 --> 01:24:04,833
I'll be waiting for such moment.

862
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:12,332
I believe such moment will
decide my life partner.

863
01:24:13,829 --> 01:24:14,829
I hope you understand.

864
01:24:19,079 --> 01:24:23,082
Given my beauty,
I can't fall in love that easily.

865
01:24:28,582 --> 01:24:30,083
I will wait for that moment.

866
01:24:30,829 --> 01:24:35,332
Ahaa.. didn't you mock me
by singing in the morning.

867
01:24:35,582 --> 01:24:39,229
Your beauty is miniscule
compared to world's beauty.

868
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:42,329
- You had a few lines of rap also.

869
01:24:42,579 --> 01:24:47,082
Whoever marries you,
his life goes from frying pan to fire.

870
01:24:47,331 --> 01:24:48,332
You may become ash.

871
01:24:48,829 --> 01:24:50,269
Change your mind.

872
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:51,578
Shit

873
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:53,584
Pavan

874
01:25:07,029 --> 01:25:09,333
We should've stopped the candles.

875
01:25:33,829 --> 01:25:35,083
Its over. Relax.

876
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:46,579
Thank god!

877
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:02,328
Hey

878
01:26:03,979 --> 01:26:06,082
Sameerana, are you okay?

879
01:26:07,229 --> 01:26:11,579
No Pavan.. I can't breath.
Asthma is kicking in.

880
01:26:13,329 --> 01:26:15,580
Its getting difficult.

881
01:26:15,631 --> 01:26:16,631
Hey Sameerana.

882
01:26:17,079 --> 01:26:18,329
You'll be fine.

883
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:22,078
It will be okay, but where is that thing..

884
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,120
what's that?

885
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:25,379
- Inhale..
- Yes Inhaler.

886
01:26:26,735 --> 01:26:27,579
Do you have it on you?

887
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:33,080
I asked you to open the
doors to get inhalers.

888
01:26:35,229 --> 01:26:37,379
So sorry. Come on

889
01:26:37,579 --> 01:26:39,328
Forgive me for this.

890
01:26:39,579 --> 01:26:41,779
Do you have any other medicines.

891
01:26:42,579 --> 01:26:44,629
We can't do anything..

892
01:26:44,829 --> 01:26:51,279
Its like leaving that fish on floor..

893
01:26:52,079 --> 01:26:54,329
Look at me. You'll be fine.

894
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:12,333
Sameerana.. you will be fine.

895
01:27:14,128 --> 01:27:18,078
With all this beauty,
how come I have asthma.

896
01:27:20,983 --> 01:27:21,579
Arghh..

897
01:27:21,983 --> 01:27:23,233
Hey, is anybody outside?

898
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:30,178
Try breathing.. you'll be fine.

899
01:27:30,278 --> 01:27:32,184
Keep looking at me.

900
01:28:01,930 --> 01:28:04,928
Look up.. Everything will be fine.

901
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:10,432
You're breath. I am air. Do you remember?

902
01:28:33,179 --> 01:28:34,580
Heyy

903
01:28:38,682 --> 01:28:43,683
I guess your Einstein mind will
throws coins instead of bangles..

904
01:28:46,483 --> 01:28:51,184
Bro, you have any idea what
a lady einstein could do?

905
01:28:57,930 --> 01:28:59,931
I'm so sorry.

906
01:29:04,429 --> 01:29:06,183
I put you in this situation.

907
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:09,679
Nothing should happen because of me.

908
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:10,679
Please stay.

909
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:15,332
Try taking longer breaths.

910
01:29:16,728 --> 01:29:18,979
There's a lot to see in life..

911
01:29:19,179 --> 01:29:22,080
Swara music will put a
big picture of yours..

912
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:23,929
You should become that big.

913
01:29:26,129 --> 01:29:30,933
More than anything,
you should come hug me..

914
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:32,713
..and express your love.

915
01:29:36,935 --> 01:29:39,179
Sameerana.. Sameerana?

916
01:29:42,135 --> 01:29:43,428
Take longer breaths.

917
01:29:44,429 --> 01:29:47,429
Everything will be fine.

918
01:30:15,330 --> 01:30:20,430
With tearing eyes and bleeding heart..

919
01:30:20,682 --> 01:30:25,433
stranded lost at the
shore of passing time..

920
01:30:25,930 --> 01:30:31,082
Every breath you leave,
becomes a final word..

921
01:30:31,182 --> 01:30:36,436
Every breath is confronting my silence.

922
01:30:36,683 --> 01:30:41,437
Conflict is me, fight is with myself.

923
01:30:41,681 --> 01:30:46,932
How is it justified if
you become a statuette.

924
01:30:47,032 --> 01:30:52,584
If the heart stops and
you become motionless..

925
01:30:52,683 --> 01:30:57,679
I can't find your
existence in imagination.

926
01:30:58,430 --> 01:31:00,430
I've lost it all.

927
01:31:01,087 --> 01:31:03,182
I've lost it all.

928
01:31:03,681 --> 01:31:08,183
I've lost it all.. with you.

929
01:31:08,931 --> 01:31:13,678
I've lost it all..

930
01:31:13,936 --> 01:31:19,833
I've lost it all..

931
01:31:19,930 --> 01:31:26,932
In darkness of heart, I've lost it all.

932
01:31:26,937 --> 01:31:29,433
I've lost it all.

933
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:40,188
In the waves at end of sight.
, I jumped and lost it all.

934
01:32:02,332 --> 01:32:07,183
In the laps of sea and swings of waves,

935
01:32:07,283 --> 01:32:12,929
entertaining you by falling and raising.

936
01:32:13,185 --> 01:32:16,385
A fish following your essence..

937
01:32:16,529 --> 01:32:18,328
..swimming all the way.

938
01:32:23,233 --> 01:32:28,435
Time is merciless and asked
me to throw the bait..

939
01:32:28,535 --> 01:32:33,638
Neglecting your heart, I let it go.

940
01:32:33,937 --> 01:32:39,181
Overwhelming sadness is drowning me..

941
01:32:39,281 --> 01:32:42,937
To appease now is like going upstream.

942
01:32:55,432 --> 01:33:00,436
This curse will hunt me to death..

943
01:33:00,536 --> 01:33:05,679
My heart is wordless, soul is lifeless.

944
01:33:05,779 --> 01:33:10,934
Coming times looks like vaccum..

945
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:16,430
I am drowning in my own tears.

946
01:33:17,081 --> 01:33:19,680
I've lost it all.

947
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:22,931
I've lost it all.

948
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:32,680
I've lost it all.

949
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:37,682
I've lost it all..

950
01:34:02,691 --> 01:34:05,699
Maybe God puts problems
and solutions together.

951
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:23,984
Hey Guys.

952
01:34:24,084 --> 01:34:29,636
Me and this girl got stuck in a lift,
after the bomb blast in the mall.

953
01:34:31,234 --> 01:34:34,234
She has severe asthma,
right now she is not able to breath.

954
01:34:35,885 --> 01:34:37,235
Not sure if she can make it alive or not.

955
01:34:38,133 --> 01:34:41,737
Not sure what to do and
how to get out of here.

956
01:34:41,985 --> 01:34:43,786
Please save us from here.

957
01:34:44,485 --> 01:34:45,239
Please!

958
01:34:45,483 --> 01:34:47,984
Please inform to Police or rescue team.

959
01:34:48,484 --> 01:34:49,684
Please save us.

960
01:34:50,482 --> 01:34:55,737
I'm recording this on 24 January,
its around 4:30 in the morning.

961
01:34:55,986 --> 01:34:56,986
One second.

962
01:35:01,487 --> 01:35:04,739
Please get a similar
inhaler when you reach here.

963
01:35:05,487 --> 01:35:07,238
Please don't forget.

964
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:08,136
Please save her.

965
01:37:03,532 --> 01:37:04,435
Sameerana.

966
01:37:06,184 --> 01:37:07,185
Sameerana. Wake up!

967
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:37,467
Sir!

968
01:38:38,469 --> 01:38:39,221
Is this my daughter?

969
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:42,322
Its her.

970
01:38:42,325 --> 01:38:44,067
Don't worry. Please sit.

971
01:38:44,219 --> 01:38:46,752
Don't worry. I will take care of this.

972
01:38:47,071 --> 01:38:48,070
Control Room.

973
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:47,978
Do you have an inhaler?

974
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:52,680
Bro, do you have inhaler?

975
01:39:53,027 --> 01:39:53,877
Bro, make it fast.

976
01:39:57,453 --> 01:39:58,646
Is anyone inside?

977
01:39:59,429 --> 01:40:00,030
Yes.

978
01:40:00,177 --> 01:40:03,028
We are inside. Please help.

979
01:40:05,278 --> 01:40:06,279
Sameerana.

980
01:41:47,870 --> 01:41:49,777
Samee. Samee.

981
01:41:50,331 --> 01:41:51,079
Samee

982
01:41:52,416 --> 01:41:53,869
Samee. What is all this?

983
01:41:53,969 --> 01:41:57,117
Mom is here. You'll be fine.

984
01:42:16,371 --> 01:42:17,371
Open your eyes.

985
01:42:18,170 --> 01:42:19,170
Samee.

986
01:42:19,470 --> 01:42:21,118
Samee, try to breath.

987
01:42:22,871 --> 01:42:23,369
Samee.

988
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:29,866
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

989
01:42:29,970 --> 01:42:30,869
Wake up.

990
01:42:31,521 --> 01:42:32,119
Try to breath.

991
01:42:38,170 --> 01:42:39,118
You'll be safe.

992
01:42:56,871 --> 01:42:59,621
Though I gave life to you..

993
01:42:59,721 --> 01:43:07,869
..I feel breathless whenever
you have trouble breathing.

994
01:43:21,370 --> 01:43:22,620
Nothing will happen to you.

995
01:44:41,676 --> 01:44:43,486
- Let it go.
- No Sis.

996
01:44:44,383 --> 01:44:48,136
I couldn't forgive myself if
something happened to her.

997
01:45:15,414 --> 01:45:17,914
Its beyond my belief,

998
01:45:18,663 --> 01:45:20,664
If this life is mine.

999
01:45:21,164 --> 01:45:23,869
My breath's address,

1000
01:45:24,119 --> 01:45:27,368
Shows the way to you.

1001
01:45:27,618 --> 01:45:32,117
Recalling your struggle,

1002
01:45:32,935 --> 01:45:37,871
I was ignorant all this while.

1003
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:44,753
Never for a second in this turmoil,

1004
01:45:45,238 --> 01:45:50,722
Did I stop searching for you.

1005
01:47:49,413 --> 01:47:51,713
You should become such a famous singer..

1006
01:47:51,813 --> 01:47:53,212
..swara music will host your photo.

1007
01:47:53,959 --> 01:47:57,461
You should come running towards me..

1008
01:47:57,561 --> 01:48:01,010
hug me and say "I Love You".

1009
01:48:47,463 --> 01:48:49,461
I Love You Pavan.

1010
01:48:56,359 --> 01:49:00,461
You didn't feel love for me,
until you almost lost your life.

1011
01:49:01,209 --> 01:49:01,958
I don't know.

1012
01:49:02,058 --> 01:49:05,712
I could see your love in that moment.

1013
01:49:06,262 --> 01:49:09,361
But I couldn't hug you then.

1014
01:49:09,461 --> 01:49:15,460
Mom struggles whenever I feel breathless..

1015
01:49:15,463 --> 01:49:18,963
I could see the same with you then.

1016
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:24,511
Which girl can refuse someone who
loves her like her mother does.

1017
01:49:29,712 --> 01:49:35,613
But for you to be impressed
shouldn't he be Mr. Universe.

1018
01:49:39,210 --> 01:49:41,209
I don't think there's such a man yet.

1019
01:49:41,962 --> 01:49:47,763
Even for him to exist,
he should be born to a beauty like me.

1020
01:50:07,035 --> 01:50:09,485
98.. eight 8s.

1021
01:50:09,933 --> 01:50:13,432
Got it. I'll Whatsapp you.

1022
01:50:13,632 --> 01:50:14,391
Bye!

1023
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:18,588
I'll call you.

1024
01:50:19,091 --> 01:50:20,240
Yeah!
