1
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,021
How many beds
are there in this flat?

2
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,902
A couple, I guess.

3
00:02:41,723 --> 00:02:42,434
Is this not your home?

4
00:02:42,524 --> 00:02:44,064
No.

5
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:50,540
So, you're not the romantic that
stuck the stars in the ceiling?

6
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,882
No. That doesn't
mean I'm not a romantic.

7
00:02:53,972 --> 00:02:59,714
Do you always like
to do it on the floor?

8
00:03:00,434 --> 00:03:02,465
It was a spur of the moment.

9
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:07,016
Yeah, well, my back hurts.
It doesn't happen too often.

10
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:09,697
For the moment,
you can rest assured.

11
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:13,159
But wait, does that mean
we can have an uncool?

12
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,219
Onto bed, of course.

13
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:20,197
Let's see, I need some
time to recover first.

14
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:21,767
No pressure.

15
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,153
Do you at least know
where the shower is?

16
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:31,096
- A thing in here for you.
- Thank you.

17
00:04:00,014 --> 00:04:04,705
Would you mind if I take this off? It's
starting to bother me a little bit.

18
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:06,766
To where's you feel
most comfortable?

19
00:04:06,856 --> 00:04:07,666
Good.

20
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:10,499
That's where I'd have
to keep it on all evening.

21
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,277
It was just a game.

22
00:04:12,397 --> 00:04:14,728
Good excuse to
show off my purchase.

23
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:15,548
Don't get cocky.

24
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:24,400
I like you more like this.

25
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:29,041
Is that a compliment?

26
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,402
Yes, can I tell?

27
00:04:31,682 --> 00:04:32,782
Thanks.

28
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,788
Undercover celebrity
or secret service agent?

29
00:04:55,969 --> 00:04:57,749
Intergalactic seducer.

30
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,042
You're going to have to show me an
intergalactic seducer certificate to prove it.

31
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:03,893
Fuck, I left it at home.

32
00:05:05,094 --> 00:05:08,455
All jokes aside, what do you do?

33
00:05:10,797 --> 00:05:13,083
Don't you want to
keep our lives secret?

34
00:05:13,198 --> 00:05:17,140
We could come up with a fictional
identity for each other.

35
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,612
We don't know anything
about each other.

36
00:05:20,702 --> 00:05:26,965
So? Don't you find it fun to explore
a different version of ourselves?

37
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:28,926
I don't know.

38
00:05:31,147 --> 00:05:34,929
Sorry, sometimes I get a
little carried away by my idea.

39
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,672
No, no, no,
don't apologise, it's fine.

40
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,395
Marcello.

41
00:05:43,416 --> 00:05:45,068
Marcello.

42
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:46,258
Yeah.

43
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:48,700
You remind me of the Delta Beta.

44
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,872
Do you like old black
and white movies?

45
00:05:50,962 --> 00:05:52,573
Masterpieces never grow old.

46
00:05:52,663 --> 00:05:54,044
That's true.

47
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:58,907
Well.

48
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:09,253
I can't wait to hear more about
your career as an aerospace engineer.

49
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:12,284
With pleasure
but first we toast...

50
00:06:15,246 --> 00:06:20,449
- ...to artificial satellites
- To the sweet life.

51
00:06:30,097 --> 00:06:32,118
I didn't realize how late it was.

52
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,560
Time flies in my company.

53
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,041
Maybe I should change
your name to Modest.

54
00:06:38,842 --> 00:06:43,043
M.M. Marcello Modest,
the best of the best.

55
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:45,744
I've created a monster.

56
00:06:50,506 --> 00:06:52,727
Do you have to wake
up early tomorrow?

57
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:54,827
No.

58
00:06:55,828 --> 00:06:58,519
I'm asking you because,
you know,

59
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:02,010
by now your carriage's already
turned back into a pumpkin.

60
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,331
Are you asking me to stay?

61
00:07:07,852 --> 00:07:12,173
Yeah, okay, yeah, I'm yet to
determine your profession, so...

62
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:13,673
Great.

63
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,015
Chocolate shop owner.

64
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:22,304
Could be offended.

65
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:24,363
No. No, I didn't mean anything
by it. I didn't...

66
00:07:24,453 --> 00:07:25,556
That's the door

67
00:07:26,356 --> 00:07:28,752
I'm seriously, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

68
00:07:28,842 --> 00:07:30,128
I'm only winding you up.

69
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:32,097
Arsehole.

70
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:35,249
I'm sorry,
what did you just call me?

71
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:37,459
How dare you call
me an arsehole?

72
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,640
You come to my flat
and you call me an arsehole?

73
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,230
Which isn't even my flat anyway.

74
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,801
- Okay, now it's me that's starting to....
- Leave it.

75
00:07:58,323 --> 00:08:01,583
Wait here,
I'm gonna get something.

76
00:08:15,607 --> 00:08:17,137
Guess what's inside.

77
00:08:17,227 --> 00:08:18,947
Viagra's and poppers.

78
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:21,828
What a perverse mind.

79
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:26,909
Can I?

80
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:37,192
It's beautiful.

81
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:40,833
Where did you find it?

82
00:08:41,174 --> 00:08:43,475
In a flea market in Istanbul.

83
00:08:44,075 --> 00:08:45,446
The gentleman who sold it to me,

84
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:49,377
who, by the way, had the thickest
moustache I have ever seen,

85
00:08:49,918 --> 00:08:53,870
told me that it dates back to
the times of Sultan Murad III.

86
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,060
No.

87
00:08:56,715 --> 00:09:01,308
Legend has it that a nobleman
gave it his favorite slave

88
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:04,683
with the promise that should the number
three come up three times in a row

89
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:06,475
he would free him.

90
00:09:06,566 --> 00:09:10,095
The master however
was in love with the slave

91
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:14,219
so every night he would pray that
he wouldn't throw three threes,

92
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:16,730
so that he would
never abandon him.

93
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,582
It is rumored that
the dice was enchanted

94
00:09:20,672 --> 00:09:23,030
because his wish came true.

95
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,634
The slave remained by his side
until his death.

96
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:29,965
- And you were persuaded.
- I couldn't resist.

97
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:34,746
It's a bit of a sad
story though, isn't it?

98
00:09:34,836 --> 00:09:37,351
You know, the slave
never gains his freedom.

99
00:09:37,537 --> 00:09:39,317
Well, maybe

100
00:09:39,737 --> 00:09:41,727
he was the one
who was really free.

101
00:09:41,817 --> 00:09:43,178
While

102
00:09:43,478 --> 00:09:47,418
his master was a slave
to the love he felt for him.

103
00:09:49,499 --> 00:09:51,279
If you say so.

104
00:09:52,219 --> 00:09:54,050
Listen, Mr Skepticism.

105
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,851
How about we put
the legend to a test?

106
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:57,771
How?

107
00:09:57,861 --> 00:09:59,421
We play a game.

108
00:09:59,662 --> 00:10:03,013
Each face of the dice
corresponds to an action

109
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,764
that we must perform.

110
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:07,155
And who decides the actions?

111
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:08,385
We do.

112
00:10:08,786 --> 00:10:12,198
Okay, I'm in,
but under one condition.

113
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:13,658
You can never back down.

114
00:10:13,748 --> 00:10:15,859
You must always do
what the dice says.

115
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,390
Obviously,
I told you it's enchanted.

116
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:20,431
Okay, perfect.

117
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:22,272
Okay, so.

118
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:28,550
Number one,
tell an uncomfortable truth.

119
00:10:28,747 --> 00:10:32,375
- We start strong.
- This is no joke.

120
00:10:34,315 --> 00:10:35,675
Number two...

121
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,922
Do something the other
one likes.

122
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:41,297
Sold.

123
00:10:45,658 --> 00:10:49,807
Number three, invite a third
person into the apartment.

124
00:10:49,898 --> 00:10:52,457
I can already see your sinister
intentions.

125
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:56,292
What? Sinister intentions are all
in the eyes of the beholder.

126
00:10:56,382 --> 00:10:59,125
I'd be very careful
of the eyes of the beholder.

127
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:02,535
Four,
do a hundred push-ups.

128
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,756
No, actually, no.
I don't want that one.

129
00:11:04,846 --> 00:11:05,946
Um...

130
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:10,910
Decently blindfolded.

131
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,221
And I am the pervert.

132
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:15,412
Nope.
You're just silly.

133
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,661
Number five,
leave the apartment.

134
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:23,572
Fuck, the game gets tough.

135
00:11:23,672 --> 00:11:29,014
But what happens
if it's your turn?

136
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:32,205
Well, you're leaving anyway.

137
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:34,456
It's me who rented
the apartment.

138
00:11:35,096 --> 00:11:37,687
Yeah, fair enough.

139
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:43,038
And six, sex.

140
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:44,289
So predictable.

141
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:46,837
Well, at least we think
of it the same way.

142
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:50,081
So, here's yours.

143
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,682
Thank you.

144
00:11:59,846 --> 00:12:01,566
I asked for it.

145
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,100
How's she?

146
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:14,401
Well, believe it or not, I am
not the new kid in the block.

147
00:12:14,491 --> 00:12:17,312
Yeah, you're a true nerve man.

148
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,598
Yep.

149
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:30,593
That's it.

150
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:34,945
Okay, you can stand up now.

151
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:36,726
Can I trust you?

152
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:40,069
Okay.

153
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:44,664
Okay, this way.

154
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:52,543
To the left, keep going, here
we are, and a bit to this way,

155
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:59,367
and now to this way, and
now this, here we are.

156
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,260
And we need to come this way.

157
00:13:25,615 --> 00:13:37,781
So, your first task will be, no not that,
you will have to prepare the spritz.

158
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:40,342
Seriously?

159
00:13:40,463 --> 00:13:42,354
Come on,
it's not that difficult.

160
00:13:42,444 --> 00:13:43,234
Okay.

161
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:45,956
Let's put this down.

162
00:13:46,046 --> 00:13:46,496
Yeah.

163
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:48,307
Start with that.

164
00:13:50,552 --> 00:13:51,243
Go.

165
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,083
Is this dry?

166
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:53,463
Yeah.

167
00:13:53,553 --> 00:13:54,503
Go.

168
00:13:54,593 --> 00:13:56,204
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

169
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:56,324
No.

170
00:13:56,414 --> 00:13:56,644
That's it?

171
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:57,144
No.

172
00:13:57,234 --> 00:13:57,324
No.

173
00:13:57,414 --> 00:13:59,685
And then this one now.

174
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:00,005
Go.

175
00:14:00,095 --> 00:14:01,125
Okay.

176
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,485
Okay.

177
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:02,675
Yes.

178
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:04,786
Yeah.

179
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:04,926
Here.

180
00:14:05,016 --> 00:14:05,186
Yeah.

181
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:05,406
Yeah.

182
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:06,616
But enough.

183
00:14:07,477 --> 00:14:08,547
And then that one.

184
00:14:08,637 --> 00:14:08,767
Wait.

185
00:14:08,857 --> 00:14:09,587
Open it.

186
00:14:09,677 --> 00:14:10,787
Okay.

187
00:14:10,877 --> 00:14:11,848
There you go.

188
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:13,038
Okay.

189
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:14,228
And go for it.

190
00:14:14,318 --> 00:14:15,489
Enough, enough, enough.

191
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:17,329
Put it down.

192
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:17,949
That's it.

193
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:18,729
Put it down.

194
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:20,480
Did I make a mess of it?

195
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:25,392
Let's say that it
looks quite boozy.

196
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:26,212
Yes.

197
00:14:26,302 --> 00:14:26,952
Okay.

198
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:29,183
Drink.

199
00:14:29,383 --> 00:14:29,553
Drink.

200
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:32,484
You're gonna need it now.

201
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:39,936
That's a good thing.

202
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:41,166
Yeah.

203
00:14:45,504 --> 00:14:47,816
We'll start with a bang.

204
00:14:47,906 --> 00:14:49,817
Come on.
I don't know anything about you.

205
00:14:49,907 --> 00:14:52,328
You've got a wide choice.

206
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:53,969
Okay.

207
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,373
When I was in college,
still young and handsome,

208
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:03,247
I worked as a cam
boy for a while.

209
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:04,248
Are you kidding me?

210
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:05,698
I swear.

211
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:09,912
Well, my parents didn't
want me to study literature.

212
00:15:10,002 --> 00:15:13,143
They said it was
a useless degree.

213
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:17,006
I, of course,
decided to do it anyway.

214
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:21,910
So that's where your passion for
playing with dice comes from then.

215
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:28,033
I hadn't thought of that before. Well
I see that you're quite the expert too.

216
00:15:28,453 --> 00:15:34,426
Well sometimes I went to CAM websites
and I remember seeing the roll the dice option

217
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:39,138
that determined what the model would do
next. I just never got what I wanted.

218
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,719
What was that you wanted?

219
00:15:45,252 --> 00:15:49,334
These cuts were really good.

220
00:15:49,775 --> 00:15:52,956
Did you ever meet
any of your fans?

221
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:58,910
No. Most of the time
I didn't even have to undress.

222
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,871
It's, er, there are many,
many people in the world

223
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,022
who just want the attention
of a handsome guy.

224
00:16:05,983 --> 00:16:08,164
Such a generous soul.

225
00:16:08,404 --> 00:16:09,115
Ahem.

226
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:09,755
Matcha Lumote.

227
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:16,840
Were you never embarrassed?

228
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,763
And what? When you're in a locker
room, don't you see dicks around you?

229
00:16:20,853 --> 00:16:22,514
Yeah, but it's different.

230
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,448
Are you afraid of a hard time?

231
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:29,631
No, actually I think of myself
as more of an enthusiast.

232
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:36,517
Are you expecting someone?

233
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,947
This late.

234
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:12,452
No please, let me go, let me go, I can
explain, I can explain, I can explain.

235
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:17,644
Yeah, I am really curious to know why you've
come to our flat at two in the morning.

236
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:23,827
You're crazy! Do you want
me to die of a heart attack?

237
00:17:24,728 --> 00:17:27,970
And you, what do you think
you're doing with that?

238
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,572
Who the fuck are you?
Why do you have keys?

239
00:17:33,193 --> 00:17:34,613
I'm Maria.

240
00:17:36,662 --> 00:17:38,193
The cleaning lady!

241
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:39,213
I'm gonna call the police.

242
00:17:39,303 --> 00:17:40,834
No! No, no, no! Police!

243
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:43,175
I wasn't here to steal, I swear.

244
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:45,316
And what did you want to do?

245
00:17:45,406 --> 00:17:46,557
Are you Italian?

246
00:17:56,591 --> 00:17:58,282
I've lost my wedding ring.

247
00:17:58,372 --> 00:18:01,203
When my husband found out,
he kicked me out.

248
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:02,825
He thinks I've got a lover.

249
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,165
And you expect
us to believe you?

250
00:18:04,255 --> 00:18:06,487
No, no, no.
That's the truth. I swear.

251
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:10,889
They wouldn't let me
go home until I find it.

252
00:18:10,979 --> 00:18:13,199
And you want to sleep here?

253
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,331
No! Do you listen
to me when I speak?

254
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:18,272
I just want to find my ring
and save my marriage.

255
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:21,074
Come on,
let's start looking for it.

256
00:18:21,164 --> 00:18:22,264
What?

257
00:18:24,705 --> 00:18:28,427
Really? My gosh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

258
00:18:29,648 --> 00:18:30,418
Okay.

259
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:53,115
Damn!

260
00:19:02,878 --> 00:19:04,178
Shit!

261
00:19:17,784 --> 00:19:19,816
Excuse me, but you can't.

262
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,982
What the fuck is going on?

263
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:52,167
No!

264
00:19:54,807 --> 00:19:56,228
In summary.

265
00:19:56,448 --> 00:19:59,558
'Sta disgraziata,
lost her ring while cleaning.

266
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:00,979
I have rented this apartment.

267
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:04,359
And you are interrupting
my date with him.

268
00:20:04,449 --> 00:20:09,261
So I kindly give you ten minutes to
find it and then you have to evaporate.

269
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:10,711
Understand?

270
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,402
Open your eyes.

271
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:00,376
Do you still love me like this?

272
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:02,099
You're gorgeous.

273
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:05,886
I mean it.

274
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:07,519
What do you think?

275
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:09,410
Be honest.

276
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:15,833
It's not so bad.

277
00:22:18,494 --> 00:22:20,435
It's so sweet of you, Barry.

278
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:30,670
Well, let's see if you'll
soon be embarrassed too.

279
00:22:33,014 --> 00:22:34,354
Again?

280
00:22:34,795 --> 00:22:38,318
The truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

281
00:22:40,381 --> 00:22:44,204
Strawberries make me sick.

282
00:22:45,675 --> 00:22:46,546
Strawberries.

283
00:22:46,636 --> 00:22:47,547
Yes.

284
00:22:47,637 --> 00:22:51,089
They have this shape that
looks like an irritated tongue.

285
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,251
They are watery
almost all the time.

286
00:22:53,341 --> 00:22:55,953
And the damn green stalk.

287
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,655
I don't think that counts
as an uncomfortable truth.

288
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:01,057
Of course it does,
it's a nightmare.

289
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:04,560
Every time I buy a fruit salad,
or they serve a cake,

290
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,503
or even when I order a cocktail.

291
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,424
I find it there, impaled
on the edge of the glass,

292
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:11,786
and I'm forced to
remove them meticulously

293
00:23:11,876 --> 00:23:13,047
in front of everyone.

294
00:23:13,137 --> 00:23:14,187
And people stare at me

295
00:23:14,277 --> 00:23:16,208
as if I were committing
some sacrilege.

296
00:23:16,298 --> 00:23:18,459
I think that's a
bit of a stretch.

297
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,832
See, you're discriminating
against me too.

298
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:23,482
Okay.

299
00:23:24,683 --> 00:23:28,176
And what about
the other berries?

300
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:30,337
No, I've got a fairly good
relationship with the others.

301
00:23:30,427 --> 00:23:30,537
Okay.

302
00:23:30,627 --> 00:23:31,638
The berries in particular.

303
00:23:31,728 --> 00:23:32,618
Okay, let's switch to the tea.

304
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:35,309
Your turn.

305
00:23:38,338 --> 00:23:39,709
Okay, but last lap for tonight.

306
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,400
Okay.

307
00:23:47,764 --> 00:23:49,054
Yes!

308
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:50,344
On the bed this time.

309
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:52,746
Okay.

310
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:16,807
Slowly, slowly. My god, I'm so
sorry, I'm so awkward, I'm sorry.

311
00:25:16,897 --> 00:25:18,509
It's okay, don't worry.

312
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:22,101
No, no,
I really can't get used to...

313
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:40,254
Do you really have the strength
to get dressed and go?

314
00:25:40,344 --> 00:25:44,907
I mean, if you insist.

315
00:25:54,374 --> 00:25:55,788
Goodnight.

316
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,681
Goodnight.

317
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:40,713
Good morning, Mr. Fetishist.

318
00:26:40,803 --> 00:26:41,273
No, I...

319
00:26:41,363 --> 00:26:42,704
It's okay.

320
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:44,505
I've seen worse.

321
00:26:47,127 --> 00:26:48,747
I thought you'd left.

322
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,089
I can't until the dice say so...

323
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,736
Come on.

324
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,156
I can't find the bread.

325
00:27:05,497 --> 00:27:06,917
How did you sleep?

326
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:08,789
Well, thank you.

327
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:11,671
Your concert induces sleeping.

328
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:14,542
I don't snore.
You must have dreamt it.

329
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:25,268
Anyway, I wanted to tell you that it's not one
of my habits to have sex dates with strangers.

330
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:26,459
Usually...

331
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:29,290
I don't see anything
wrong with casual sex.

332
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:35,833
What I mean is there are people out there
that are more or less comfortable with it.

333
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,154
Me...

334
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:42,127
I don't like sharing my intimacy
unless I feel a connection.

335
00:27:42,217 --> 00:27:44,158
What made you change your mind?

336
00:27:44,318 --> 00:27:49,680
Full disclosure,
yesterday I was furious.

337
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,711
A guy I liked disappeared
all of a sudden without

338
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:58,233
any warning. He was telling me how
much of a wonderful person I am,

339
00:27:58,323 --> 00:28:04,315
how he really liked me. I guess
I was trying to punish myself for

340
00:28:04,405 --> 00:28:05,825
falling for it.

341
00:28:08,176 --> 00:28:10,138
Not that bad for a punishment.

342
00:28:12,362 --> 00:28:15,566
Let's talk about serious things.

343
00:29:12,803 --> 00:29:13,134
Is it bad or good?

344
00:29:13,224 --> 00:29:14,444
You know it's so bad

345
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,770
I have a boyfriend.

346
00:29:58,636 --> 00:30:00,156
Okay.

347
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,110
I didn't tell you before because
I didn't know that was the case.

348
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,361
No, of course. Don't worry.

349
00:30:12,704 --> 00:30:15,305
It was not a simple decision,
but...

350
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:21,161
Little by little we realised that there
was space in our lives for other people.

351
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:26,514
If it works for you. I don't
judge others on their choices.

352
00:30:29,237 --> 00:30:31,458
Yes, it worked.

353
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:38,202
Have you ever had any
experiences of this kind?

354
00:30:58,264 --> 00:30:59,904
Not until now.

355
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:13,212
- Hi!
- Hello!

356
00:31:13,646 --> 00:31:15,772
- Max, is it?
- That's it. Max.

357
00:31:16,852 --> 00:31:18,052
Hello.

358
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,457
Toilet?

359
00:31:24,847 --> 00:31:26,917
Down there to the right.

360
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:44,320
Hello, handsome.
How are you? I'm Max.

361
00:31:44,781 --> 00:31:46,151
Nice to meet you.

362
00:31:46,241 --> 00:31:47,461
Hi.

363
00:31:47,702 --> 00:31:52,045
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just need to
go because I drank two liters of detox.

364
00:31:52,563 --> 00:31:53,663
Moody.

365
00:31:54,484 --> 00:31:55,174
Feel free.

366
00:31:55,264 --> 00:31:56,444
Thank you.

367
00:31:56,645 --> 00:32:00,766
But then, I'm all yours.

368
00:32:07,749 --> 00:32:09,249
Interesting choice.

369
00:32:37,261 --> 00:32:41,372
Guys, let's put on some music.

370
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:44,272
It's like a morgue in here.

371
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:48,703
Silence, silence, silence.

372
00:33:16,926 --> 00:33:24,459
I love your beard, cat.
It's so... soft.

373
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:27,490
So Max,
what do you do for a living?

374
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:33,051
Nothing interesting, obviously.

375
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:34,912
I mean...

376
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:38,985
I mean, in the sense,
it doesn't matter.

377
00:33:39,075 --> 00:33:39,765
Tell us anyway.

378
00:33:39,855 --> 00:33:42,126
Are we here to fuck or to lounge?

379
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:45,947
We enjoy a little
conversation before the action.

380
00:33:46,037 --> 00:33:47,248
Okay.

381
00:33:47,338 --> 00:33:49,469
Okay, I see, I see, I see.

382
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:52,199
You're intellectual ladies.

383
00:33:55,381 --> 00:33:58,502
Anyway, thank you so
much to share this hotness.

384
00:34:00,222 --> 00:34:01,333
We were playing a game.

385
00:34:01,423 --> 00:34:03,374
Do you want to participate?

386
00:34:03,464 --> 00:34:04,624
Yes.

387
00:34:09,626 --> 00:34:12,978
Okay, what should I do?

388
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:15,940
You roll a dice and depending
on what number comes up,

389
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,361
you take an action.

390
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:20,232
Mind you, it is a magic dice.

391
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:22,424
Magic dice?

392
00:34:22,514 --> 00:34:24,274
Interesting, I love it.

393
00:34:24,655 --> 00:34:26,015
Give me the dice.

394
00:34:50,191 --> 00:34:52,522
I can't believe it,
bullshitting people like this.

395
00:34:52,612 --> 00:34:53,924
Sorry, rules are rules.

396
00:34:54,014 --> 00:34:54,884
Fuck your rules.

397
00:34:54,974 --> 00:34:56,586
Fuck your rules and fuck you.

398
00:34:56,676 --> 00:34:57,286
Fuck you.

399
00:34:57,376 --> 00:34:58,087
Fuck you too.

400
00:34:58,177 --> 00:34:59,817
Maybe next time.

401
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,890
Fuck you.

402
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,291
You shouldn't.

403
00:35:04,381 --> 00:35:06,793
Or just put a hand inside it.

404
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:08,404
Fuck the dice.

405
00:35:17,273 --> 00:35:19,465
- Saved by the dice.
- But we cheated.

406
00:35:19,555 --> 00:35:22,406
Yeah, but it was a matter
of survival, did you see?

407
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,168
For a moment there,
I feared the worst.

408
00:35:25,258 --> 00:35:26,741
I'm a big girl.

409
00:35:36,704 --> 00:35:40,025
I swear, I was about to explode.

410
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:43,207
You were just jealous
because all the attention was on me.

411
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:46,400
I would have gladly
left him to you.

412
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:48,251
You invited him...

413
00:35:53,815 --> 00:35:56,396
You have a penchant
for muscular cardio.

414
00:35:57,177 --> 00:36:01,900
We all want a trophy so we can
brag about dating a hottie.

415
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,593
I don't know. I generally
prefer other types of beautiful.

416
00:36:05,683 --> 00:36:09,625
The uniqueness,
the mental connection.

417
00:36:10,686 --> 00:36:12,897
However,
if Max hadn't opened his mouth,

418
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:15,544
you would have fucked
him without a problem.

419
00:36:15,768 --> 00:36:18,168
Probably.

420
00:36:22,709 --> 00:36:23,809
What?

421
00:36:29,031 --> 00:36:30,251
No.

422
00:36:34,932 --> 00:36:36,592
Maria will be happy.

423
00:36:51,654 --> 00:36:52,705
Do you like this kind of music?

424
00:36:55,177 --> 00:36:57,029
Can't I say anything?

425
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:06,587
Concentrate.

426
00:39:23,005 --> 00:39:26,137
Have you ever listened to
the neighbours through the walls?

427
00:39:26,227 --> 00:39:27,707
Sometimes.

428
00:39:28,128 --> 00:39:30,999
Fortunately, we're not
close to a bathroom, so...

429
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:32,249
Silly.

430
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:36,321
I would worry more about
what the neighbours had earlier.

431
00:39:36,411 --> 00:39:37,872
And I help out.

432
00:40:26,821 --> 00:40:30,372
Once, as a kid, a friend
of my mother's came on to me.

433
00:40:34,082 --> 00:40:36,604
Are you sure you want
to talk about this?

434
00:40:41,366 --> 00:40:44,867
I was brushing my teeth as
he walked in to take a shower.

435
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:53,010
I remember he was wearing some
ridiculous pea green pajamas.

436
00:40:54,964 --> 00:41:01,147
I quickly finished rinsing my mouth, and I was
about to leave, and he called me back.

437
00:41:02,389 --> 00:41:04,650
Can you pass me the shampoo?

438
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:07,872
Something like that.

439
00:41:11,034 --> 00:41:14,896
When I got closer, I saw
that he was touching himself.

440
00:41:16,938 --> 00:41:23,302
For a moment, I watched him. I had
never seen an erect penis before.

441
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:30,104
Then he asked me
if I wanted to touch it.

442
00:41:37,207 --> 00:41:39,387
I just knew that
something was wrong.

443
00:41:40,128 --> 00:41:42,298
I dropped the shampoo
and ran away.

444
00:41:42,388 --> 00:41:44,369
It was nothing terrible.

445
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,990
But I still think
about it and...

446
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,162
I feel guilty.

447
00:41:52,252 --> 00:41:53,352
Why?

448
00:41:54,493 --> 00:41:56,333
You didn't do anything wrong.

449
00:41:59,418 --> 00:42:01,812
My silence.

450
00:42:03,455 --> 00:42:06,493
I told myself that it wasn't
worth ruining his life.

451
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:10,629
He's always been nice to me.

452
00:42:13,389 --> 00:42:17,188
But a few days later, he quarreled with
my mother and I never saw him again.

453
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,891
But over time,
I started thinking...

454
00:42:25,553 --> 00:42:28,154
...what if he molested
some other kid?

455
00:42:37,408 --> 00:42:39,668
Couldn't have stopped him.

456
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:42,696
You're a victim.

457
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:46,821
You're not at fault.

458
00:42:52,874 --> 00:42:54,254
I never know.

459
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,380
- Well...
- Listen...

460
00:43:26,362 --> 00:43:28,604
- Sorry, you go.
- No, no, please.

461
00:43:29,486 --> 00:43:32,849
Let's see if another
hot session comes up.

462
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,332
Can't we just do it?

463
00:43:35,573 --> 00:43:36,933
I like the risk.

464
00:44:07,014 --> 00:44:10,652
Sooner or later
it had to happen.

465
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,919
But what if I want to stay?

466
00:44:15,801 --> 00:44:18,142
- It wouldn't be fair.
- Why?

467
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:27,044
The reason why it was so intense is
that we knew it would be over soon.

468
00:44:28,126 --> 00:44:31,700
Right.

469
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:34,111
Are you so terrified
by the future?

470
00:44:54,549 --> 00:45:04,698
Well, I haven't felt so good with someone
in a long time, so thank you, really.

471
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:08,880
And the same goes for me.

472
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,700
Goodbye, Marcello.

473
00:45:38,243 --> 00:45:39,343
Wait!

474
00:45:41,484 --> 00:45:42,984
I have an idea.

475
00:45:45,005 --> 00:45:46,505
We meet here

476
00:45:46,685 --> 00:45:48,436
on exactly the same day

477
00:45:48,526 --> 00:45:51,027
in the number of years
that the dice sets.

478
00:45:52,828 --> 00:45:54,828
I don't see much sense in it.

479
00:45:55,708 --> 00:45:57,949
I'd love to see
you again someday.

480
00:45:59,606 --> 00:46:01,929
Find out how we've changed.

481
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:07,116
They created Facebook
for things like that.

482
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,640
I'm serious.

483
00:48:37,166 --> 00:48:39,554
I didn't have time to knock.

484
00:48:39,974 --> 00:48:41,234
Come in.

485
00:48:42,395 --> 00:48:44,015
Are you going somewhere?

486
00:48:44,435 --> 00:48:44,885
No.

487
00:48:44,975 --> 00:48:48,166
Yes, the supermarket.
I needed something.

488
00:48:48,256 --> 00:48:49,306
No, no, no, no, don't worry.

489
00:48:49,396 --> 00:48:51,396
I can go with another time.

490
00:48:57,738 --> 00:48:59,238
Three years.

491
00:49:00,138 --> 00:49:01,318
Fuck.

492
00:49:01,979 --> 00:49:04,359
Don't tell me.

493
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:05,939
You look good.

494
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,141
Thanks.
Just a few more grey hairs.

495
00:49:09,341 --> 00:49:11,922
You'll soon become
a respectable daddy.

496
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:18,875
Not funny. By the way,
you're not that far off either.

497
00:49:18,965 --> 00:49:20,485
Would you like a drink?

498
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:24,747
On spritz's? Blindfolded?

499
00:49:25,467 --> 00:49:26,728
It's coming.

500
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,021
Cheers!

501
00:49:50,501 --> 00:49:51,701
Cheers!

502
00:50:01,605 --> 00:50:03,845
Am I wrong or is there big news?

503
00:50:10,873 --> 00:50:12,448
Congratulations!

504
00:50:12,588 --> 00:50:13,768
Thank you.

505
00:50:13,869 --> 00:50:15,519
- How long?
- Two years now.

506
00:50:15,609 --> 00:50:17,590
It's a bit lucky.

507
00:50:18,511 --> 00:50:21,940
I realised I needed someone
to sleep by my side every night.

508
00:50:25,855 --> 00:50:27,136
And you?

509
00:50:28,249 --> 00:50:29,777
I'm single again.

510
00:50:30,143 --> 00:50:31,558
Shit.

511
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,061
I'm sorry.

512
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:38,262
C'est la vie!

513
00:50:45,727 --> 00:50:47,487
I thought you weren't coming.

514
00:50:48,089 --> 00:50:53,372
I had my doubts,
but the curiosity was too much.

515
00:50:53,493 --> 00:50:58,376
Well, I'm glad you made
the right choice.

516
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:17,168
Listen, do you still
have that famous dice?

517
00:51:19,758 --> 00:51:21,078
Of course I do.

518
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:25,429
I know that's actually
what you're here for.

519
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:26,939
Okay, you got me.

520
00:51:54,106 --> 00:51:56,726
It was my turn,
if I remember correctly.

521
00:52:05,888 --> 00:52:07,968
Dice doesn't do foreplay.

522
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:16,230
So, shall we go to the bedroom?

523
00:52:17,251 --> 00:52:20,111
Does your husband
agree with all that?

524
00:52:21,803 --> 00:52:26,964
Let's just say that, in very rare cases,
we allow ourselves some exploration.

525
00:52:27,865 --> 00:52:34,087
Well, I am flattered that you've
chosen to take advantage of it with me.

526
00:52:35,427 --> 00:52:37,848
Don't you want to
explore with me?

527
00:53:08,341 --> 00:53:12,259
Even better than
I remembered it.

528
00:53:12,552 --> 00:53:16,908
- Yeah, even if different.
- What?

529
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:20,484
How to explain it?
It's more of a sensation.

530
00:53:25,587 --> 00:53:29,834
I have the sensation
of sinking with sweat.

531
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:33,592
- Shower?
- With pleasure.

532
00:53:36,194 --> 00:53:37,045
You go in first.

533
00:53:37,135 --> 00:53:39,936
Thank you, such a gentleman.

534
00:53:53,819 --> 00:54:02,603
There you go.

535
00:54:02,743 --> 00:54:05,435
Shit, sorry. Apologies.

536
00:54:05,525 --> 00:54:07,065
Come here.

537
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:12,358
Seriously, come on!

538
00:54:12,448 --> 00:54:20,732
You know, I've never understood
that thing you Italians use.

539
00:54:21,894 --> 00:54:27,168
The sole and high purpose
of the bidé is to wash your bum.

540
00:54:27,258 --> 00:54:28,938
This is how it works.

541
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,131
Open the tap.

542
00:54:32,221 --> 00:54:34,913
Make sure the water
is not too hot or cold.

543
00:54:35,003 --> 00:54:35,914
You sit down on it.

544
00:54:36,004 --> 00:54:38,645
You apply soap.

545
00:54:38,886 --> 00:54:40,967
I'd recommend a delicate one.

546
00:54:41,127 --> 00:54:45,140
You rub your tushy with water,
nice and suave.

547
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:47,422
Give it a rinse. Close the tap.

548
00:54:47,512 --> 00:54:49,363
Stand up. You're done!

549
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:51,113
Nice and fresh!

550
00:54:53,008 --> 00:54:56,099
It's already the best part.

551
00:54:56,189 --> 00:55:00,950
I am ready to explode.

552
00:55:15,513 --> 00:55:19,414
Um, are you going to
continue excavating?

553
00:55:21,826 --> 00:55:25,338
I don't remember
you being this scrotoclastor.

554
00:55:25,428 --> 00:55:27,580
Stop trying to
act all intellectual,

555
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:30,203
you're using big, obscure words.

556
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,215
Tomorrow.

557
00:55:37,456 --> 00:55:38,576
Okay.

558
00:55:39,637 --> 00:55:42,169
So, are you going to sleep here?

559
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:43,830
If I'm not one too many.

560
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,572
Of course not,
it's just that, I thought...

561
00:55:46,662 --> 00:55:48,883
I don't need a
permit to sleep over.

562
00:55:49,964 --> 00:55:51,424
Okay, great.

563
00:56:31,647 --> 00:56:34,775
- What time is it?
- 10h00.

564
00:56:36,516 --> 00:56:38,180
Let's go.

565
00:57:09,976 --> 00:57:12,648
Aww, she's Samira.

566
00:57:12,738 --> 00:57:13,448
Hello.

567
00:57:13,538 --> 00:57:14,638
Hi.

568
00:57:14,919 --> 00:57:16,610
Okay.

569
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,553
You didn't need to show the world
that you're little ass there.

570
00:57:19,643 --> 00:57:22,655
But I need to prepare people
because mine is much more beautiful.

571
00:57:22,745 --> 00:57:24,136
No, it's much more hairy.

572
00:57:24,226 --> 00:57:25,986
I didn't need to know that.

573
00:57:26,888 --> 00:57:29,500
So, everything in order here?

574
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:32,742
The girl who replaced
me seems quite a stoner.

575
00:57:32,832 --> 00:57:36,044
Don't worry,
nothing out of place.

576
00:57:36,134 --> 00:57:37,815
No wedding rings.

577
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:40,649
Don't remind me.

578
00:57:40,739 --> 00:57:42,690
What a panic that day.

579
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,831
Thank you again
for saving my life.

580
00:57:44,921 --> 00:57:46,192
How is everything
with your husband?

581
00:57:46,282 --> 00:57:47,013
He's great.

582
00:57:47,103 --> 00:57:48,314
Thanks so much.

583
00:57:48,404 --> 00:57:50,315
He's like a little lamb now.

584
00:57:50,405 --> 00:57:52,676
Although I'm a bit
jealous of that tiny pest

585
00:57:52,766 --> 00:57:54,457
who steals all the attention.

586
00:57:54,547 --> 00:57:55,178
You're awful.

587
00:57:55,268 --> 00:57:58,860
What about you two?

588
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:03,003
I still don't
understand one thing.

589
00:58:03,093 --> 00:58:04,664
Are you together or not?

590
00:58:04,754 --> 00:58:05,854
No.

591
00:58:06,656 --> 00:58:09,887
That's a shame.
You look so good together.

592
00:58:09,977 --> 00:58:12,828
Yeah, well, um,
circumstances are...

593
00:58:12,918 --> 00:58:15,929
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I'm a meddler.

594
00:58:16,019 --> 00:58:18,319
No, really? I didn't notice.

595
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,020
Sorry.

596
00:58:26,362 --> 00:58:28,582
She's already a heartbreaker.

597
00:58:30,903 --> 00:58:32,003
Yes.

598
00:58:43,874 --> 00:58:47,285
Holy shit,
we need a diving mask here.

599
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:50,486
Okay, so this is a recipe my aunt
used to make us as a child,

600
00:58:50,576 --> 00:58:54,027
so please don't mess it up.

601
00:58:54,117 --> 00:58:56,937
Feel the carrots.

602
00:58:57,878 --> 00:59:00,708
I never had any
talent in the kitchen.

603
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:02,829
Didn't you have
a chocolate shop?

604
00:59:02,919 --> 00:59:04,249
Right,
I was almost forgetting that.

605
00:59:04,339 --> 00:59:09,050
Well, it's never too
late in life to learn.

606
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:12,141
It only takes a
minimum of commitment.

607
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:19,380
Don't do that.

608
00:59:19,921 --> 00:59:21,061
You what?

609
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:27,245
So?

610
00:59:29,788 --> 00:59:30,819
No.

611
00:59:30,909 --> 00:59:33,220
You will not be allowed to give
this with kisses, Mr. Modest.

612
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:33,741
Okay?

613
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:34,341
Come on.

614
00:59:34,431 --> 00:59:37,303
Okay.

615
00:59:37,393 --> 00:59:38,493
Good?

616
01:00:10,251 --> 01:00:11,551
Stop it.

617
01:00:12,812 --> 01:00:14,992
You're throwing it all together.

618
01:00:16,073 --> 01:00:17,634
For what?

619
01:00:18,594 --> 01:00:20,225
Don't recycle.

620
01:00:20,315 --> 01:00:21,415
No.

621
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,416
Seriously.

622
01:00:25,152 --> 01:00:30,407
Come on,
it's not the end of the world.

623
01:00:30,497 --> 01:00:37,774
No, just thousands of dead animals, we end up
polluting our waters and drinking microplastics.

624
01:00:37,864 --> 01:00:39,576
I didn't think you were
such an environmentalist.

625
01:00:39,666 --> 01:00:43,159
It's not a question about being an
environmentalist, you're smarter than this.

626
01:00:43,249 --> 01:00:48,393
Well, now you finally have an excuse to
flaunt your moral superiority over me.

627
01:00:51,612 --> 01:00:53,344
And what the fuck is
that meant to mean?

628
01:00:53,434 --> 01:00:54,205
Nothing, nothing.

629
01:00:54,295 --> 01:00:56,367
No, no, no, no, no, sorry.

630
01:00:56,457 --> 01:00:58,289
I don't do it to feel superior.

631
01:00:58,379 --> 01:01:00,191
If you wanna play victim,
choose another topic.

632
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:02,653
Okay, okay, you're right.

633
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:04,604
Let's set it here, please.

634
01:01:37,793 --> 01:01:39,339
Sorry about before.

635
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:41,920
Okay.

636
01:01:44,053 --> 01:01:45,738
Do you want us to keep playing?

637
01:02:06,548 --> 01:02:08,509
I haven't been well lately.

638
01:02:12,151 --> 01:02:16,514
One morning I woke up
and I couldn't move my right arm.

639
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:20,884
I thought it was just a cramp,
but it didn't go away.

640
01:02:21,277 --> 01:02:23,129
The doctor ran some
tests and it turns out

641
01:02:23,219 --> 01:02:25,960
that there is a
shadow on my spine.

642
01:02:27,522 --> 01:02:28,622
Wait.

643
01:02:31,244 --> 01:02:33,025
What the fuck are you saying?

644
01:02:35,128 --> 01:02:37,428
I'm awaiting
the results of the biopsy.

645
01:02:39,369 --> 01:02:41,580
I'm sorry,
I can't imagine what...

646
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:43,520
I should have told
you right away.

647
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:45,070
Don't be silly.

648
01:02:45,311 --> 01:02:47,211
I didn't know how you'd react.

649
01:02:48,151 --> 01:02:50,312
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

650
01:02:50,552 --> 01:02:52,232
Or you'll suffer.

651
01:02:55,253 --> 01:02:56,794
Isn't it funny?

652
01:02:57,914 --> 01:03:00,955
Nobody sees pain unless
you choose to reveal it.

653
01:04:01,925 --> 01:04:05,267
I'll see you then.

654
01:04:06,888 --> 01:04:09,440
Hello boys.

655
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:12,371
Hello, Steve.

656
01:04:14,312 --> 01:04:17,094
Where are those faces?

657
01:04:18,195 --> 01:04:19,975
Don't you like my costume?

658
01:04:20,396 --> 01:04:23,337
Yeah, very original.

659
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:26,179
Meet Marcello Modest.

660
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:28,070
Hi.

661
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,212
Nice to meet you.

662
01:04:30,302 --> 01:04:31,402
Hi.

663
01:04:35,741 --> 01:04:38,002
So, how did you two meet?

664
01:04:38,723 --> 01:04:40,674
Wasn't it an orphan's tastings?

665
01:04:40,764 --> 01:04:43,415
No, don't listen to him.

666
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:45,678
We met a couple
of years ago online,

667
01:04:45,768 --> 01:04:49,019
but I got engaged before
we had the chance to meet.

668
01:04:49,109 --> 01:04:52,001
Unfortunately, we never
got past the big, big stage.

669
01:04:52,091 --> 01:04:54,622
Can I try it?

670
01:04:54,712 --> 01:04:55,812
Yeah!

671
01:04:58,274 --> 01:05:00,836
Why are you dressed like this?

672
01:05:01,136 --> 01:05:04,118
I sent you a message.

673
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:07,220
I was at the parade today,
remember?

674
01:05:29,049 --> 01:05:31,040
Jesus, it's hot in this thing.

675
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:32,680
That's normal.

676
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:36,091
It's a demon from hell.

677
01:05:42,861 --> 01:05:46,954
We were playing a game.
Do you want to participate?

678
01:05:47,044 --> 01:05:55,708
We throw a dice to decide which actions
to take. I'll give you an example.

679
01:05:55,809 --> 01:06:02,792
Okay, so two means that Marcello has to
do something that we like. Any ideas?

680
01:08:07,256 --> 01:08:09,017
How did it seem to you?

681
01:08:09,378 --> 01:08:12,650
Weird, but good.

682
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:16,382
Like I was breaking down
some sort of invisible barrier.

683
01:08:18,384 --> 01:08:22,286
I didn't understand that goal.

684
01:08:22,787 --> 01:08:23,887
OK.

685
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:27,370
What's your interpretation?

686
01:08:28,152 --> 01:08:33,444
I don't know, it felt like a mix
of yoga and group dynamics.

687
01:08:33,534 --> 01:08:38,792
I think you should stop trying to analyse
everything and just focus on what you really felt.

688
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:46,850
Okay, it's my turn to play.

689
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:49,931
Yeah, yeah it is.

690
01:08:50,021 --> 01:08:51,432
What are the other rules?

691
01:08:51,522 --> 01:08:53,734
One, inconvenient truth.

692
01:08:53,824 --> 01:08:55,974
Two, you've already seen.

693
01:08:56,064 --> 01:08:58,275
Three, invite someone else over.

694
01:08:58,365 --> 01:09:00,315
Four, do something blindfolded.

695
01:09:00,405 --> 01:09:01,896
Five, leave the apartment.

696
01:09:01,986 --> 01:09:04,066
And six, fuck.

697
01:09:04,786 --> 01:09:07,517
Yeah?

698
01:09:07,607 --> 01:09:09,318
Um, if you're not
comfortable with any of that,

699
01:09:09,408 --> 01:09:10,918
we can change one of them.

700
01:09:11,008 --> 01:09:13,889
No, I'm okay with that.

701
01:09:16,289 --> 01:09:17,550
Okay.

702
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:20,841
I'm curious.

703
01:09:20,931 --> 01:09:23,071
What the hell, Steve?

704
01:09:24,843 --> 01:09:32,645
Leave the apartment? Yes, these are
the rules. Okay, alright, but not right away.

705
01:09:33,026 --> 01:09:37,647
Don't worry, I'll take this opportunity
to see my sister, she lives nearby.

706
01:09:45,789 --> 01:09:50,380
So, you two make the most of it. I'm sorry,
I was pleased to meet you, I hope to see

707
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:51,824
you again one day.

708
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:53,311
Sure, daddy.

709
01:10:07,327 --> 01:10:09,759
Too bad,
I was starting to like him.

710
01:10:09,849 --> 01:10:11,059
You were giving him daggers.

711
01:10:11,149 --> 01:10:12,640
Who, me?

712
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:14,661
Yeah, you were looking
like a jealous boyfriend.

713
01:10:14,751 --> 01:10:17,782
Well, can't deny that
the focus was all on you.

714
01:10:17,872 --> 01:10:20,043
Aw, poor Marcello.

715
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:21,124
Thinking about it, after all,

716
01:10:21,214 --> 01:10:23,565
the spiel of the body
and the emotions

717
01:10:23,655 --> 01:10:25,546
should have given him
a good shag, at least.

718
01:10:25,636 --> 01:10:28,917
Wow, you should have
thought about that beforehand.

719
01:10:29,297 --> 01:10:30,517
Sucker!

720
01:10:30,718 --> 01:10:32,629
What the fuck are you doing?

721
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:34,039
Crazy.

722
01:10:44,003 --> 01:10:45,343
Hello.

723
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:49,509
Yes, it's me.

724
01:10:51,276 --> 01:10:53,289
Yeah, absolutely.

725
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:56,555
Okay.

726
01:10:58,155 --> 01:10:59,448
So...

727
01:11:04,794 --> 01:11:06,076
But is it certain?

728
01:11:08,735 --> 01:11:11,556
Yeah, sure. When?

729
01:11:13,056 --> 01:11:14,576
No, don't worry.

730
01:11:18,157 --> 01:11:22,098
Alright, see you on Monday.
Bye.

731
01:11:27,139 --> 01:11:28,639
What's happening?

732
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:33,760
Marcello?

733
01:11:34,101 --> 01:11:37,721
My name is not Marcello.
Marcello doesn't exist.

734
01:11:49,927 --> 01:11:51,394
I need chemo.

735
01:12:02,113 --> 01:12:04,174
Everything's gonna be okay.

736
01:12:05,435 --> 01:12:07,275
You're strong as a rock.

737
01:12:07,916 --> 01:12:09,587
Look at this.

738
01:12:09,677 --> 01:12:12,008
- Sorry, I, erm...
- No, are you kidding me?

739
01:12:12,864 --> 01:12:15,339
Come on,
let's go lie down for a bit.

740
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:18,352
No, I prefer to keep playing.

741
01:12:18,442 --> 01:12:20,794
I really don't think
this is the right time.

742
01:12:20,884 --> 01:12:22,735
Really, I don't want
to think about it now.

743
01:12:22,825 --> 01:12:24,336
I understand that, but...

744
01:12:24,426 --> 01:12:27,901
I am serious. I want to play.

745
01:12:44,036 --> 01:12:45,694
I'm sorry.

746
01:12:47,856 --> 01:12:50,787
Marcello, don't be childish,
it's just a game.

747
01:12:50,877 --> 01:12:53,337
The games are over
when one loses, no?

748
01:12:55,318 --> 01:12:58,629
Come on.

749
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:00,709
Your husband will
be waiting for you.

750
01:13:00,799 --> 01:13:03,657
What's my husband got
to do with anything of this?

751
01:13:04,941 --> 01:13:06,981
Marcello, please stop.

752
01:13:07,641 --> 01:13:09,782
Just talk to me for a minute.

753
01:13:11,222 --> 01:13:13,203
Marcello, please.

754
01:13:13,403 --> 01:13:15,036
Turn the lights off
when you leave.

755
01:13:15,836 --> 01:13:19,649
For fuck's sake, please stop.
Stop!

756
01:13:20,884 --> 01:13:21,874
See you again in two years.

757
01:13:24,124 --> 01:13:25,705
If I'm still around.

758
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:28,286
Please, don't say that.

759
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:40,090
Marcello...

760
01:13:51,398 --> 01:13:54,721
Fuck.

761
01:13:58,322 --> 01:13:59,882
Fuck!

762
01:16:01,130 --> 01:16:02,161
Wait,
we don't even know our names.

763
01:16:02,251 --> 01:16:03,517
Shut up.

764
01:16:04,277 --> 01:16:05,953
You're so nice, dawg.

765
01:16:06,044 --> 01:16:09,015
Stop trying to change things.
We didn't speak the first time.

766
01:16:20,089 --> 01:16:22,538
I forgot the condom in the bedroom.

767
01:17:08,646 --> 01:17:11,368
I remember our first meeting
differently.

768
01:17:24,759 --> 01:17:27,120
The stars in the ceiling
aren't there anymore.

769
01:17:53,871 --> 01:17:56,673
I often thought about you
during the treatment.

770
01:17:58,134 --> 01:18:00,876
I imagine telling you
how my day was.

771
01:18:03,138 --> 01:18:05,199
The jokes to the nurses,

772
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:07,521
the crap I ate,

773
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:10,163
the progress I made,

774
01:18:11,804 --> 01:18:13,805
the things that scared me.

775
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:17,188
I thought about you too.

776
01:18:18,609 --> 01:18:20,270
I was really worried.

777
01:18:21,592 --> 01:18:24,323
I'm pissed off with
the way you behaved.

778
01:18:24,413 --> 01:18:27,694
I'm sorry.

779
01:18:27,994 --> 01:18:30,235
I didn't mean to hurt you.

780
01:18:31,536 --> 01:18:32,996
I was afraid.

781
01:18:33,976 --> 01:18:35,177
Of what?

782
01:18:36,857 --> 01:18:40,518
To screw everything up,
like I always do.

783
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:44,230
You'd just got fucking married.

784
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:49,392
I thought, if I leave now,
he won't suffer.

785
01:18:49,482 --> 01:18:53,163
You're a compassionate arsehole.

786
01:18:53,916 --> 01:18:55,902
More or less.

787
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:02,425
Love stories end
one way or another.

788
01:19:03,225 --> 01:19:07,340
You would have guessed that my marriage
would have fallen apart so soon.

789
01:19:07,966 --> 01:19:09,806
I'm sorry to hear that.

790
01:19:11,047 --> 01:19:12,547
It is what it is.

791
01:19:16,795 --> 01:19:20,176
The truth is that we have
no control over our lives.

792
01:19:32,231 --> 01:19:36,161
Maybe that's why
I can't stop playing.

793
01:19:40,182 --> 01:19:44,223
We should keep playing
until the dice says so.

794
01:19:45,143 --> 01:19:46,703
No compromise.

795
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:49,485
No responsibilities.

796
01:19:51,006 --> 01:19:53,986
Even if we end up
hating each other.

797
01:19:55,627 --> 01:19:59,200
I'm interested to see what will
happen before we get to that point.

798
01:20:26,369 --> 01:20:28,388
Won't the owners get angry?

799
01:20:28,478 --> 01:20:29,918
I am the owner.

800
01:20:30,858 --> 01:20:31,958
What?

801
01:20:32,179 --> 01:20:36,000
Yeah, they made me a good offer.
I liked the place.

802
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,312
Congratulations
when do you move in?

803
01:20:39,402 --> 01:20:41,860
I've actually been
living here for a while.

804
01:20:43,543 --> 01:20:45,404
I cannot believe it.

805
01:20:46,165 --> 01:20:48,825
I was tired of wondering.

806
01:20:49,986 --> 01:20:53,887
I needed to stop and take root.

807
01:21:00,891 --> 01:21:02,991
Well we need to
fucking celebrate.

808
01:21:04,772 --> 01:21:06,413
Let's see what the dice says.

809
01:21:11,234 --> 01:21:13,015
We have to celebrate.

810
01:21:45,378 --> 01:21:49,018
I am terrified of dying before
I've done everything I want.

811
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:52,079
But you can't. No one can.

812
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,553
I want to read all the books,

813
01:21:54,953 --> 01:21:57,612
visit all the countries,
see all the movies.

814
01:21:57,722 --> 01:22:00,192
- I want everything.
- You want too much.

815
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:04,584
I don't care. I'm here.
I exist.

816
01:22:04,675 --> 01:22:07,711
And as long as I'm alive
I have the right to dream.

817
01:22:07,802 --> 01:22:10,245
I have the right to
pursue happiness.

818
01:22:11,066 --> 01:22:14,406
And you? What do you want?

819
01:22:15,067 --> 01:22:18,308
To listen to all the records,
cook all the recipes,

820
01:22:18,398 --> 01:22:21,719
fuck all the men,
I want everything too.

821
01:22:21,809 --> 01:22:24,620
Well, I want to try and get
as close as possible.

822
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:28,610
We have the power to try,
until the end.

823
01:22:28,931 --> 01:22:32,311
We have the duty to try,
until the end.

824
01:24:47,605 --> 01:24:49,096
Can you believe we're
still seeing each other

825
01:24:49,186 --> 01:24:50,396
after all these years?

826
01:24:50,486 --> 01:24:52,736
It's definitely only
because of the dice.

827
01:24:52,826 --> 01:24:54,226
Screw you.

828
01:24:57,913 --> 01:25:00,118
Did I tell you I was
suffering from panic attacks

829
01:25:00,208 --> 01:25:01,858
every time I had
to take the bus?

830
01:25:01,948 --> 01:25:04,439
Can't you talk about
silly stuff for once?

831
01:25:04,529 --> 01:25:08,830
Like, I don't know,
candles that smell like vaginas.

832
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:11,441
You're not very subtle when
you want to change the subject.

833
01:25:11,531 --> 01:25:14,217
Do you really want to
talk about panic attacks?

834
01:25:14,891 --> 01:25:16,972
No, of course not.

835
01:25:21,526 --> 01:25:24,727
I remember all the names
of the people I've slept with.

836
01:25:25,347 --> 01:25:26,118
Impressive.

837
01:25:26,208 --> 01:25:27,308
Yep.

838
01:25:28,148 --> 01:25:30,619
Well, except for mine.

839
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:34,770
Yeah, but that doesn't matter.
You'll always be my Marcello Modest.

840
01:25:37,251 --> 01:25:38,531
Enrico.

841
01:25:39,892 --> 01:25:41,152
That's my name.

842
01:25:42,113 --> 01:25:43,233
Really?

843
01:25:43,853 --> 01:25:44,953
No.

844
01:25:45,894 --> 01:25:48,835
I can't with you.
I really can't.

845
01:25:52,321 --> 01:25:58,426
Okay, so let's see. What was
the name of your third boyfriend?

846
01:25:58,827 --> 01:26:04,411
Adam. I was 19 and he was
older than my father.

847
01:26:05,152 --> 01:26:08,067
Yeah, at that point I didn't
think I deserved love.

848
01:26:08,235 --> 01:26:10,106
And you were terrified
of taking the bus.

849
01:26:10,196 --> 01:26:15,200
Yeah, exactly. What a mess?

850
01:26:19,702 --> 01:26:22,522
I know it sounds stupid, but...

851
01:26:23,948 --> 01:26:27,345
... I thought everyone would abandon
me when I found out I was gay.

852
01:26:30,507 --> 01:26:36,789
Well I wish I'd been there to tell
you that you were so fucking wrong.

853
01:26:39,131 --> 01:26:41,082
You can be nice when you want.

854
01:26:41,172 --> 01:26:42,652
I can indeed.

855
01:26:43,793 --> 01:26:49,575
I just feel like I have so much love in my body
and yet there's so little in the reality around us.

856
01:26:50,818 --> 01:26:52,379
Let it all out.

857
01:26:53,521 --> 01:26:55,522
Let it flood everything.

858
01:31:26,853 --> 01:31:28,254
Where's the dice?

859
01:31:31,615 --> 01:31:35,356
Did someone by mistake take
the dice that was in this box?

860
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:42,861
I'll repeat it, who took
the dice that was in here?

861
01:31:43,001 --> 01:31:44,221
What's wrong?

862
01:31:45,923 --> 01:31:47,683
Do you know where the dice is?

863
01:31:49,625 --> 01:31:50,725
No?

864
01:31:52,987 --> 01:31:55,308
Well, it must be somewhere.

865
01:31:57,870 --> 01:31:58,970
Shit.

866
01:32:00,812 --> 01:32:03,032
Marcello, calm down.

867
01:32:03,173 --> 01:32:04,653
Where is my dice?

868
01:32:07,171 --> 01:32:10,102
- Where is my dice?
- Marcello, stop it!

869
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:11,343
Shit.

870
01:32:12,733 --> 01:32:13,853
Shit!

871
01:32:15,833 --> 01:32:17,073
Shit!

872
01:32:17,214 --> 01:32:20,464
Marcello, stop it!

873
01:32:20,554 --> 01:32:21,854
Stop it!

874
01:32:23,375 --> 01:32:24,655
Stop it!

875
01:32:24,895 --> 01:32:26,586
You hit it, tell me the truth.

876
01:32:26,676 --> 01:32:27,786
Me? Are you crazy?

877
01:32:27,876 --> 01:32:29,986
- Who took it then?
- I had no idea!

878
01:32:30,076 --> 01:32:32,427
- You did it!
- Are you listening to yourself?

879
01:32:32,517 --> 01:32:35,678
- Take it out!
- I didn't take your fucking dice!

880
01:32:49,950 --> 01:32:53,338
Stop it! You're hurting me!

881
01:33:32,075 --> 01:33:36,828
Do you really need the dice
after all these years?

882
01:33:42,857 --> 01:33:44,918
I don't know. I think...

883
01:33:52,227 --> 01:33:57,000
I think I was afraid of losing you.

884
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:59,531
I know it has to happen.
It's inevitable.

885
01:34:03,791 --> 01:34:09,477
If it's you the one who decides
to leave me, and not the dice,

886
01:34:09,567 --> 01:34:12,435
I don't think I could bear it.

887
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:25,922
I'm sorry. I don't think
I can do this anymore.

888
01:34:27,183 --> 01:34:30,215
I don't think I can stay with someone
that wants to run away from themselves,

889
01:34:30,305 --> 01:34:34,147
who wants to run away from me,
and the whole world.

890
01:34:35,232 --> 01:34:37,194
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

891
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:19,241
How did you get to this point?

892
01:35:22,864 --> 01:35:24,204
I don't know.

893
01:35:27,928 --> 01:35:29,949
