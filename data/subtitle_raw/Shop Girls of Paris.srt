1
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,082
Sorry, sir.

2
00:02:31,263 --> 00:02:32,886
Thank you, sir.

3
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:47,675
Hey, you could help me.
I'm sorry.

4
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:52,845
Since we left
Saint-Lazare, I no longer exist.

5
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:55,250
And Félix, my canary?

6
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,534
Here. Here you are.
Thank you for this.

7
00:03:02,524 --> 00:03:03,586
What a trip.

8
00:03:03,787 --> 00:03:06,071
3 leagues of walking,
2 hours by patache,

9
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:08,797
a night on the railroad
and the omnibus.

10
00:03:08,998 --> 00:03:11,723
At last, we've arrived.
Paris is beautiful.

11
00:03:11,924 --> 00:03:13,607
But big.
We'll get lost.

12
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:17,334
Uncle Baudu will pilot us.
He doesn't even know us.

13
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:19,218
He'll be
all the happier for it.

14
00:03:19,418 --> 00:03:22,905
Where does the emperor live?
We'll deal with that later.

15
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:25,350
We'll get the uncle.
Monsieur?

16
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,913
Rue Saint-Augustin?

17
00:03:27,113 --> 00:03:29,358
First on the left.
What next?

18
00:03:29,538 --> 00:03:30,600
"What's next?

19
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:33,646
You need to be led
by the hand?

20
00:03:33,887 --> 00:03:37,894
We're not from around here.
It's obvious you're coming.

21
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,141
You have to be a hillbilly to get lost.
Be kind.

22
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,864
Or else what?

23
00:03:44,147 --> 00:03:48,876
Little brat!
Redneck! Dummy!

24
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,325
Oh, look.

25
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:03,225
Au bonheur des dames.
It's a real palace.

26
00:04:04,588 --> 00:04:07,353
That's where he lives,
the emperor?

27
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:16,932
I'd never have thought
stores this big.

28
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,217
We sell everything.
Even drums.

29
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,541
Oh, look.

30
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:24,547
The sales girls are pretty.
We have to choose them.

31
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:26,351
Yes. Especially for you.

32
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:30,118
I'm sending you
my portrait?

33
00:04:30,318 --> 00:04:32,643
Yes. As soon as I have
an address.

34
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:37,573
Monsieur Baugé,
the top hat is compulsory.

35
00:04:37,753 --> 00:04:38,575
Excuse me.

36
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:41,500
First
and final warning.

37
00:04:44,507 --> 00:04:47,112
The assistant manager
supervises the entrance.

38
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:49,397
He's going to force us
to wear frac.

39
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:52,563
No comments.
Final warning.

40
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:55,889
Hello everyone.

41
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,252
With this, it will be?

42
00:04:57,453 --> 00:04:59,977
A gibus, one.
And shiny.

43
00:05:04,907 --> 00:05:07,352
- A rosé, quickly.
Yes, monsieur.

44
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:10,077
White wine?
No time.

45
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:13,244
- Why do they change
their hats?

46
00:05:13,444 --> 00:05:15,408
- They have several.
Why do they do that?

47
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,133
To look cool.

48
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,219
Since it's expensive,
we put it on just to get in.

49
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,063
Like this,
we don't wear it out.

50
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,710
Why did he tell me that?
This is the place.

51
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:28,113
Come on.

52
00:05:28,994 --> 00:05:30,959
How small.
And sad.

53
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,364
The other houses
suffocate him.

54
00:05:33,564 --> 00:05:35,889
Mr Baudu,
please.

55
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:39,296
Is it here?
Can we see it?

56
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:57,491
- Not in a million years.
Do you want to strangle me?

57
00:05:57,672 --> 00:05:58,934
It's theft!

58
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:01,740
- Monsieur Baudu.
Anger leads you astray.

59
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,307
I'm not angry.
I say what is.

60
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:07,311
Baudu never minced
mince his words,

61
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:09,435
nor hidden his opinions.

62
00:06:10,116 --> 00:06:12,320
For 35 years
of serving you.

63
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,563
35 years!

64
00:06:13,763 --> 00:06:16,689
Yes, you're one of
one of our longest-standing customers.

65
00:06:16,929 --> 00:06:19,896
That doesn't stop you
from upselling me.

66
00:06:20,077 --> 00:06:21,379
Come on, come on...

67
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,024
Don't be
your sacristan air.

68
00:06:24,225 --> 00:06:26,429
The Lyonnais,
is calotin and company.

69
00:06:26,609 --> 00:06:27,912
Thank you for your time. Not in the morning.

70
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:30,237
We make this fabric for you

71
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:34,004
3.50 francs per meter.
We earn almost nothing.

72
00:06:34,946 --> 00:06:36,168
What's up?

73
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:39,735
Why do you sell it for 3.40 francs
at Le Bonheur des dames.

74
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:40,938
I asked around.

75
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:45,747
Le Bonheur des dames
orders 10,000 meters.

76
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,594
I won't sacrifice 34,000 F
to please you.

77
00:06:49,795 --> 00:06:51,598
We'll give you
credit.

78
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:54,604
You'll sign drafts.
"Drafts?

79
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:56,207
Me?
Why not?

80
00:06:56,408 --> 00:07:00,816
Baudu has never owed anyone anything.
He only buys what he can afford.

81
00:07:01,017 --> 00:07:05,507
"Drafts! An honest man
doesn't sign drafts!

82
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,911
Le Bonheur des dames has signed some.

83
00:07:08,132 --> 00:07:09,875
You're not going to compare

84
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,919
Old Elbeuf to this bazaar.

85
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,045
It's an insult
to honest businesses.

86
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:18,412
With his fake luxury,
he steals our customers.

87
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:20,376
He who laughs last, laughs hardest.

88
00:07:20,576 --> 00:07:22,821
Come on.
To get back to the question...

89
00:07:23,021 --> 00:07:25,466
3,40 F. No more
than Le Bonheur des dames.

90
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:26,428
Impossible.

91
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:29,674
Well, bye.
I'll take my business elsewhere.

92
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:30,636
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:30,836 --> 00:07:34,323
Tell the Carrezou house
that I'll be waiting for them.

94
00:07:34,764 --> 00:07:37,289
When Mouret
won't pay his bills,

95
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,537
they'll know I was right.
But it will be too late.

96
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:46,988
For Le Bonheur des dames will collapse
with a crash of scandal,

97
00:07:47,188 --> 00:07:50,194
dragging homes like yours
homes like yours,

98
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,199
who let themselves be tricked.

99
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,883
Too bad for you.

100
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:58,051
I'll be watching this revenge
on my doorstep.

101
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:01,217
I want to see Mouret
chased away by the bailiff,

102
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,101
taken away by the police.

103
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:06,427
He will pass in front of me
between the gendarmes.

104
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:10,515
I won't say anything to him.
You don't insult a defeated man.

105
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,922
But I'll buy drinks
for the whole neighborhood.

106
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:14,924
What can I do for you?

107
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:17,609
Good morning, Uncle.
Hello.

108
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,292
- Hi, Uncle.

109
00:08:21,517 --> 00:08:22,499
Who are you?

110
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:25,505
We are the children
of your brother Charles.

111
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,749
So you've
left Valognes?

112
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:31,116
Jean found a job.
At an ivory works.

113
00:08:31,316 --> 00:08:35,965
I had lost mine.
We remembered your letter...

114
00:08:36,426 --> 00:08:37,608
Ah...

115
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:43,421
I wrote you this 2 years ago,
when your parents died.

116
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,509
Well,
I said what we usually say.

117
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:51,477
But you'd be surprised
into people's homes without warning.

118
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,400
And three, all of a sudden.

119
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:55,244
Penniless, of course.

120
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:57,929
Excuse us, Uncle.
Where are you going?

121
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,693
You stay here.

122
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,618
What a character!

123
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:06,225
I don't have the right
to say what I think, then?

124
00:09:06,406 --> 00:09:07,268
Geneviève!

125
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,476
But today..,
we'll work it out as best we can.

126
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,602
Then we'll try
to fit you in somewhere.

127
00:09:14,802 --> 00:09:17,327
What's your name?
Denise.

128
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:19,211
And you, Amédée?
No. Jean.

129
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:21,856
And me, Pépé.
And him, Félix.

130
00:09:22,878 --> 00:09:24,060
Here's your cousin.

131
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:30,113
Charles's children.
They come from Normandy.

132
00:09:30,294 --> 00:09:32,438
We need to house them.

133
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:37,127
Jean and Pépé will sleep

134
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,173
in Jules' room,
my daughter's fiancé.

135
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:43,059
Jules Colomban,
my first clerk.

136
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:44,141
As for Denise,

137
00:09:44,361 --> 00:09:45,784
she'll sleep with you.

138
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:48,750
If you hadn't
postponed my wedding,

139
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,914
my room would be free.

140
00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:52,878
You could have shared it.

141
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:58,729
Uncle...
What do you want now?

142
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,613
We won't be disturbing
for long.

143
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:02,457
I'm going to look
for work.

144
00:10:02,657 --> 00:10:05,342
"Work,
you poor thing?

145
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:07,587
There's none
for anyone here.

146
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:09,591
From 3 clerks,
I went down to one.

147
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,675
We don't sell anything.
Why not?

148
00:10:11,855 --> 00:10:12,677
"Why?"

149
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:17,728
A buccaneer, an adventurer
has moved in next door,

150
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:21,295
and he hustles customers
like a carnival barker.

151
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:23,780
Here, take a look.

152
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,992
That's the one.

153
00:10:30,192 --> 00:10:31,835
From the back,
near the car.

154
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:33,439
It's Mouret.

155
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,402
All night long,
it's a wedding.

156
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:38,007
It's a waste of money
with funny girls.

157
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,214
And by day, other women
enrich it.

158
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:43,138
Look at them laugh.

159
00:10:43,318 --> 00:10:45,342
They're tickled.

160
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:49,350
He has to tell them
to them, the arsouille.

161
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,474
Be the pretty one,
murderer!

162
00:10:51,654 --> 00:10:53,157
What if we could hear you?

163
00:10:53,338 --> 00:10:54,239
He killed his wife.

164
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,562
"Killed?

165
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:57,085
- No, he's not. Daddy exaggerates.

166
00:10:57,646 --> 00:11:00,372
She fell
while visiting the works

167
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:01,454
du Bonheur des dames.

168
00:11:01,655 --> 00:11:04,781
A house
she had brought him as a dowry.

169
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:07,947
She was a holy woman.
But he forgot her.

170
00:11:08,148 --> 00:11:10,352
He has a portrait of her
in the office.

171
00:11:10,552 --> 00:11:12,957
It's the least
he owes her.

172
00:11:13,157 --> 00:11:17,366
Le Bonheur des dames
can proudly display its façade,

173
00:11:17,566 --> 00:11:19,570
there's blood
under its stones.

174
00:11:31,032 --> 00:11:33,878
A woman like you
can't hesitate.

175
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:37,846
I have a small store here.
Next door, Father Baudu's store.

176
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:41,052
Further on, the hotel
you want to sell.

177
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:43,176
I already have a buyer.
Who's interested?

178
00:11:43,377 --> 00:11:44,138
You.
You?

179
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,064
It's to buy it
that you brought me here.

180
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:48,388
I've got something better than that.

181
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:49,870
What is it?
An association.

182
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:52,476
You're the land.
You're the genius.

183
00:11:52,656 --> 00:11:54,880
Let's just say my business sense.

184
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:58,407
I shoot the Duvillard Hotel,
Baudu's store...

185
00:11:58,608 --> 00:12:00,251
Will he want to sell?
Yes.

186
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:04,780
And we'll make Le Bonheur des dames
the world's biggest department store.

187
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,146
As you go,
dear sir.

188
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,511
It's an excellent deal.

189
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:12,034
What about customers?

190
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:13,397
"Customers?
Yes.

191
00:12:13,577 --> 00:12:14,639
Come and see for yourself.

192
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,170
Customers?
But here it is.

193
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,414
All women.
All women.

194
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:24,619
In the palace
that I will build,

195
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:27,023
there will be
everything they need.

196
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:29,789
That is to say
that which is useless to them.

197
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:33,797
How well do you know them?
I like them.

198
00:12:33,977 --> 00:12:35,481
That's why I'm in this business.

199
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:38,086
Business
in an alcove atmosphere.

200
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:41,693
Charm to sell.
I return the compliment.

201
00:12:41,873 --> 00:12:44,659
My word, looking at you,

202
00:12:44,859 --> 00:12:47,905
I've come to desire
a closer association.

203
00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:51,913
Combining business with pleasure.
Why separate them?

204
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:55,360
Oh, no, you don't.
Don't mix love with business.

205
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,765
It makes doing business
pleasant.

206
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,608
Or boring love.

207
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:02,374
I don't get the impression
we'd bother.

208
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:06,181
I'll give your proposal
about your proposal.

209
00:13:07,684 --> 00:13:08,546
I love you guys.

210
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:10,750
The hardware department,
Mr.

211
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,113
In the basement.
Thank you.

212
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:15,560
Lace?
On the first floor.

213
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,569
Looking for something?
No. Just looking.

214
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,694
Watch everything at your leisure.

215
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:25,901
Au bonheur des dames,
customers are at home.

216
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:30,229
- Here you are, madame.

217
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:36,081
You're stealing my turn again!
The next customer is mine.

218
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:39,247
Go back to your farm.
And you, to your sidewalk.

219
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:41,612
We're not
in the wash-house.

220
00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:44,177
Each in your place,
in silence.

221
00:13:46,962 --> 00:13:48,064
Mademoiselle Badon,

222
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:50,188
you are a witness
that she's cheating.

223
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:52,834
You're wrong
to bicker.

224
00:13:54,236 --> 00:13:56,841
What does she think she's doing,
this one?

225
00:13:57,042 --> 00:14:00,088
You're no stronger than anyone else.
I'll prove it to you.

226
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:02,813
The 1st one that goes by,
I drop it from a coat.

227
00:14:02,994 --> 00:14:04,977
And even more expensive.

228
00:14:11,271 --> 00:14:14,237
Bonjour, mademoiselle.
Looking for a coat?

229
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,762
We have an exceptional
opportunity.

230
00:14:16,962 --> 00:14:20,128
A must-have item.
And the price...

231
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:22,292
100 francs.
You won't hesitate.

232
00:14:22,974 --> 00:14:25,579
I don't hesitate.
I'm not taking it.

233
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:28,224
It's not the desire
for it.

234
00:14:28,424 --> 00:14:31,631
Do I look like the kind of person
who can afford this?

235
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:35,719
You'll have to come back later.

236
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,364
Are you abandoning me?
You're wrong.

237
00:14:38,564 --> 00:14:41,330
The 1st quality
of a saleswoman is to be polite.

238
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,494
The 2nd, to be patient.
- Well done.

239
00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:48,023
Learn from them.
The customer is always right.

240
00:14:48,223 --> 00:14:51,189
We have to act like it.
And then curse her.

241
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:54,075
You're in the business.
I was a saleswoman.

242
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:56,280
Would you look for work?
Yes.

243
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,769
I've been told there's nothing.
There is for working women.

244
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:03,093
Bourdoncle, the register.

245
00:15:03,294 --> 00:15:05,458
Conditions:
1st year as an au pair,

246
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:08,023
fed and housed
in the house.

247
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:09,586
What's your name?

248
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:10,829
Denise Baudu.

249
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:11,991
Your address?

250
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:15,558
For the time being,
I live next door, in Le Vieil Elbeuf.

251
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:20,407
Are you related to Monsieur Baudu?
I'm his niece.

252
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:23,333
I don't think it's necessary,
Monsieur Mouret...

253
00:15:23,513 --> 00:15:24,335
Is it you?

254
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:25,818
Yes, mademoiselle.

255
00:15:26,018 --> 00:15:28,383
Your uncle hates us.
Well, he's wrong.

256
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:30,467
We're broad-minded.

257
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:33,273
Miss Baudu is hired.
She will start tomorrow.

258
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:41,569
Look at this old wreck come
to stock up on fresh meat.

259
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:47,181
He wouldn't be shy.
These ladies are for sale.

260
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:50,708
We close the store,
and continue along the sidewalk.

261
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:53,834
I'm waiting for someone.

262
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:55,597
Good evening.

263
00:15:55,798 --> 00:15:57,641
Aren't you going to change
hat?

264
00:15:57,822 --> 00:16:00,126
Tonight, to hell with greed.

265
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:04,936
We should put a big number
on this mess

266
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:08,182
and change sign :
Au bonheur des messieurs.

267
00:16:08,362 --> 00:16:10,346
That's how it'll end: in a whorehouse!

268
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:20,566
Ah, there you are.

269
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:23,051
I was expecting you for dinner.

270
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:27,821
Colomban is rehearsing at the Philharmonic,
and Geneviève will be back later.

271
00:16:28,943 --> 00:16:31,429
She took little Pépé
to the country,

272
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:33,032
in Auteuil,

273
00:16:33,232 --> 00:16:36,759
to Mme Gras, who will keep him
for 30 francs a month.

274
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,525
He can't be.
He's going to be miserable.

275
00:16:39,725 --> 00:16:42,330
But he'll be
like a rooster.

276
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:45,015
As for Jean,
he found a room.

277
00:16:45,196 --> 00:16:46,218
It makes everything better.

278
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:15,435
Uncle?

279
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,682
I hope you like soup.
It's my specialty.

280
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:20,085
Yes, Uncle.

281
00:17:20,286 --> 00:17:23,251
I wanted to tell you that...
What's up?

282
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:25,897
You're not going to get in the way
with me.

283
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:27,139
We'll tell you:

284
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,065
Baudu has his outspokenness,
but he's got a good heart.

285
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:31,588
Here you go. Already?

286
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:36,197
I thought Madame Gras
would keep you for dinner.

287
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,323
What's the matter with you?
Nothing's wrong.

288
00:17:39,503 --> 00:17:40,926
A little tired.

289
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,812
I'm going to get some rest.
Tomorrow will be better.

290
00:17:46,437 --> 00:17:48,020
- It doesn't look good.

291
00:17:48,842 --> 00:17:50,785
You should call a doctor.

292
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:58,280
I know what she's missing.
It's marriage.

293
00:17:59,803 --> 00:18:02,889
The poor girl was getting impatient.
So is Colomban.

294
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:05,375
Why don't you marry them?

295
00:18:05,555 --> 00:18:08,020
I promised to give my son-in-law

296
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:11,587
Old Elbeuf
in full bloom,

297
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:13,912
as I received it
from my father-in-law.

298
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:15,675
I have only one word.

299
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,162
What's all this?
Have a look.

300
00:18:19,362 --> 00:18:22,729
Since you broke the other one...
Does that make you happy?

301
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:25,935
You're a Baudu, aren't you?
Heart in hand.

302
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,464
Did you buy this next door?
Yes.

303
00:18:31,065 --> 00:18:34,392
Nothing from Mouret
from Mouret's should come in here!

304
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,516
He's my personal enemy.

305
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,039
He hates me.
No.

306
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:40,203
How would you know?
He told me.

307
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:43,490
Did you talk to her?
Don't be angry.

308
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,057
I have to work. I cannot
stay in your care.

309
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:50,183
I found a place
at Le Bonheur des dames.

310
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:53,951
Uncle...
Not another word.

311
00:18:54,152 --> 00:18:56,476
I offered you hospitality
this night.

312
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,680
I have only one word.

313
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:01,767
But as of tomorrow,
I don't want to see you anymore.

314
00:19:04,131 --> 00:19:06,937
Come on, ladies.
Come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

315
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:11,025
Downstairs in five minutes,
or face the fines.

316
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:12,508
Final warning.

317
00:19:14,532 --> 00:19:15,834
Come on, miss.

318
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:19,682
This is a disaster.
2 like me would fit into this dress.

319
00:19:19,882 --> 00:19:22,647
Too late. Too late.
Tonight we'll arrange it.

320
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,130
Come on, hurry up.

321
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:28,098
How many letters?
535.

322
00:19:29,862 --> 00:19:32,547
What do customers think?
They don't think.

323
00:19:32,747 --> 00:19:35,593
Like a flock of sheep,
she follows.

324
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:38,398
My respects, Madame.

325
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:44,972
Very good, your display.

326
00:19:45,173 --> 00:19:48,219
Excellent initiative.
You'll give him a bonus.

327
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:52,146
What's your name?
Favier.

328
00:19:52,327 --> 00:19:53,830
You've eaten garlic.

329
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,954
A simple clove
rubbed on bread.

330
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,318
Just enough to
suffocate customers.

331
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:01,084
I'll cancel the bonus,
and no more garlic.

332
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,449
First
and final warning.

333
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:08,579
Recognize me?
I bought you this vase.

334
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:09,661
It can be done.

335
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:12,346
My husband hates it,
he wants to throw it away,

336
00:20:12,526 --> 00:20:13,749
and he sulks.

337
00:20:13,949 --> 00:20:16,434
Please, I beg you,
exchange it for me.

338
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:19,079
The regulations
strictly forbid it.

339
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,602
Make the switch.

340
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,446
You may choose.
Thank you for your time.

341
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:23,648
At your service.

342
00:20:23,828 --> 00:20:25,692
This one will please him.

343
00:20:25,894 --> 00:20:28,218
It's much more expensive.
6.95 francs.

344
00:20:28,398 --> 00:20:29,541
Never mind.

345
00:20:29,781 --> 00:20:33,869
An unfortunate precedent.
It's an innovation.

346
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,274
The items
can be exchanged.

347
00:20:36,474 --> 00:20:38,719
How many drinks
have you had?

348
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:42,165
I'm perfectly lucid.
Do you want to ruin the house?

349
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,171
I don't want
a customer to stay away from my store,

350
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:47,656
that she has her mistake
in front of her eyes.

351
00:20:47,857 --> 00:20:50,943
This vase had become
a source of remorse for the woman.

352
00:20:51,143 --> 00:20:53,828
Well, my dear,
I don't sell remorse.

353
00:20:55,632 --> 00:20:57,956
Show me something
I like.

354
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:00,802
You want a coat,
then a cape.

355
00:21:00,982 --> 00:21:02,285
After that, it's a dress.

356
00:21:02,485 --> 00:21:05,251
That's my right.
And you must satisfy me.

357
00:21:05,451 --> 00:21:09,058
You still have to make up your mind.
Don't be cheeky,

358
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:11,543
or I file
a complaint against you.

359
00:21:11,924 --> 00:21:12,705
What's up?

360
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:15,472
Your saleswoman
doesn't know her stuff.

361
00:21:15,652 --> 00:21:17,035
She didn't sell me anything.

362
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:20,682
She refuses everything.
Because you present it badly.

363
00:21:20,882 --> 00:21:22,686
Well, then...
Don't fight back.

364
00:21:22,886 --> 00:21:25,732
Madame Aurélie,
take care of Madame.

365
00:21:25,932 --> 00:21:28,577
Mademoiselle Rémy,
take care of Madame.

366
00:21:28,778 --> 00:21:31,543
Make sure you're dressed
and your hairstyle.

367
00:21:31,744 --> 00:21:34,349
First
and final warning.

368
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,717
Do you mind?

369
00:21:41,643 --> 00:21:43,647
You're a
a lovely hostess.

370
00:21:43,847 --> 00:21:48,056
You'd be a perfect partner.
We'd do great things.

371
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:51,342
We could also
pleasant ones.

372
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:54,428
The figure for my takings yesterday
was 150,000 F.

373
00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:56,232
We'll reach a million.

374
00:21:56,432 --> 00:21:59,799
No. Yesterday, you made
113,000 francs in revenue.

375
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:01,363
How do you know?

376
00:22:02,565 --> 00:22:04,449
Do you have spies
in my house?

377
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:06,733
113,000 francs,
not bad at all.

378
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:09,058
Your land
will earn you 6%.

379
00:22:09,258 --> 00:22:10,982
7 %.
It can be done.

380
00:22:11,162 --> 00:22:12,304
That's for sure.

381
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:15,871
You're nice, attractive,
I like you,

382
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:19,198
but my trust in you
has its limits.

383
00:22:19,378 --> 00:22:21,041
Thanks anyway.

384
00:22:21,242 --> 00:22:25,691
You offer me the association
because you can't buy.

385
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:28,135
If I wanted...
Come on.

386
00:22:28,336 --> 00:22:32,825
Every time you go on sale,
you play your store.

387
00:22:33,025 --> 00:22:37,794
All I can offer you
is a forward sale.

388
00:22:37,975 --> 00:22:40,520
We'll set deadlines.

389
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:44,487
7 %. How's that?

390
00:22:44,688 --> 00:22:48,296
You're strangling me.
But with such beautiful hands...

391
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:50,180
Flattering.

392
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,226
Then 6%,
due in one year.

393
00:22:54,087 --> 00:22:57,714
7%, maturing in 6 months.

394
00:22:57,915 --> 00:23:01,161
Take it or leave it.
I'll take it.

395
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,145
The rules want us dead.

396
00:23:13,345 --> 00:23:16,631
No sitting down,
going out after 11 p.m,

397
00:23:16,832 --> 00:23:19,597
forbidden to marry
without permission...

398
00:23:19,778 --> 00:23:21,441
Don't be happy.

399
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:23,605
"Au bonheur des dames"!

400
00:23:23,826 --> 00:23:25,649
I'd like to sell.

401
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,613
I was counting on it.

402
00:23:27,813 --> 00:23:30,859
If I were you,
I'd take someone.

403
00:23:31,681 --> 00:23:33,264
What do you mean, "someone"?

404
00:23:34,186 --> 00:23:36,912
Are you serious?
Yes, I am. Why should I?

405
00:23:37,113 --> 00:23:40,960
You wouldn't be the 1st.
In the beginning, I was like you.

406
00:23:41,161 --> 00:23:44,166
We're getting married on the sly:
he works here.

407
00:23:44,347 --> 00:23:46,210
Baugé, from the pottery department.

408
00:23:46,411 --> 00:23:50,379
A kind, hard-working
serious, a musician...

409
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,703
Without his varicose veins,
he'd be perfect.

410
00:23:52,904 --> 00:23:55,268
That's awful.
What's awful? Varicose veins?

411
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:58,474
No. What you say.
Love is wonderful.

412
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:01,681
Who's talking about love?
I like my Baugé,

413
00:24:01,881 --> 00:24:05,568
but the great passion,
is for those who have the time.

414
00:24:05,749 --> 00:24:07,492
This is a luxury item.

415
00:24:07,673 --> 00:24:09,135
Bells.

416
00:24:09,336 --> 00:24:10,899
At 11 pm,
they cut off the gas.

417
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:14,466
I'll leave you my candle.
Tonight, I won't be reading.

418
00:24:14,646 --> 00:24:15,628
Good evening.

419
00:24:15,808 --> 00:24:17,392
Good evening. Thank you for your time.

420
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,967
How did you get in here?

421
00:24:45,207 --> 00:24:47,091
I'm not allowed
visits.

422
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:48,574
No one saw me.

423
00:24:48,774 --> 00:24:50,818
We had to talk.
About what?

424
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:53,263
I met a
a little brunette...

425
00:24:53,443 --> 00:24:54,746
Some other time.

426
00:24:54,946 --> 00:24:59,074
We had lunch
and dinner together at the hotel,

427
00:24:59,255 --> 00:25:00,718
but I didn't pay.

428
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:01,880
I don't care.

429
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,246
If I don't pay,
the boss kicks me out.

430
00:25:05,427 --> 00:25:06,810
Quite a drama.

431
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,055
For 5 francs.
"5 francs?

432
00:25:09,255 --> 00:25:11,139
Meals are expensive,
in Paris.

433
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:15,828
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Here they are, your 5 francs.

434
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:19,035
I'll do without shoes.
Now go.

435
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:22,922
I won't do it again.
I broke up with the girl.

436
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:26,209
I'm ruining myself for her,
and she doesn't care about me.

437
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:29,776
I've learned my lesson.
Women and I are over.

438
00:25:32,802 --> 00:25:33,623
File.

439
00:25:43,903 --> 00:25:48,332
Discussion.

440
00:25:50,797 --> 00:25:52,019
And this new floor?

441
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,025
We work there.
People can't sleep at night.

442
00:25:55,225 --> 00:25:58,473
We're talking about a petition.
And you agree with them?

443
00:25:58,673 --> 00:26:02,761
No. It comforts me.
I suffer from insomnia myself.

444
00:26:02,942 --> 00:26:03,803
At the end of the month,

445
00:26:03,984 --> 00:26:06,168
I want 50 more homes

446
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:07,891
and 3 new departments.

447
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:09,655
What are you doing here?

448
00:26:09,855 --> 00:26:12,060
What's going on?
I'll take you there.

449
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,827
Whose house are you going out to?
Nobody's.

450
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,193
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

451
00:26:19,394 --> 00:26:21,919
How, sir?
I'm on duty, sir.

452
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:24,684
I came to see
if you were doing it right.

453
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:27,209
My compliments.
You will be promoted.

454
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,975
I'll teach you
how to make fun of me.

455
00:26:30,175 --> 00:26:31,578
Mr. Mouret!
What's the matter?

456
00:26:31,778 --> 00:26:34,303
Mademoiselle,
your outfit is indecent.

457
00:26:34,483 --> 00:26:36,067
Oh...

458
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:39,553
Who are you?
I can't say.

459
00:26:39,754 --> 00:26:42,680
We'll see.
I'm not the first one here.

460
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,125
No more jokes.

461
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,730
We'll investigate.

462
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:51,017
It'll cost you.
To you and your accomplice.

463
00:26:51,217 --> 00:26:54,504
Really?
Which way did you come in?

464
00:26:54,704 --> 00:26:56,989
Well...
WELL?

465
00:26:57,169 --> 00:26:58,872
This way.

466
00:26:59,053 --> 00:26:59,995
He's got guts.

467
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:02,800
He's a fool.
No. He's a lover.

468
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,964
Bell.

469
00:27:05,205 --> 00:27:08,732
If you're not downstairs in 5 min,
beware of fines.

470
00:27:08,912 --> 00:27:10,094
Come on, come on.

471
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,499
I would have hidden it
at home.

472
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:13,942
A guy from the top.

473
00:27:14,142 --> 00:27:17,669
Silence, ladies.
Sanctions will have to be taken.

474
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,154
They will all
in my office.

475
00:27:26,827 --> 00:27:28,290
So you deny it?

476
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,056
I wouldn't have my friend
in my room.

477
00:27:31,257 --> 00:27:34,784
The bed is too small.
You want to be comfortable.

478
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:38,150
This is an investigation
of the incident.

479
00:27:38,331 --> 00:27:39,553
Thank you.

480
00:27:39,754 --> 00:27:42,840
You're dismissed.
Send in the next one.

481
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,845
A few documents to sign.
It's urgent.

482
00:27:46,026 --> 00:27:47,248
Well...

483
00:28:05,123 --> 00:28:09,051
Management has the utmost concern
of the staff.

484
00:28:09,251 --> 00:28:12,217
A serious error
would oblige us...

485
00:28:15,063 --> 00:28:17,227
Thank God for that,
you look better than yesterday.

486
00:28:18,651 --> 00:28:19,953
My compliments.

487
00:28:20,154 --> 00:28:22,599
There's that
that devil of a wick...

488
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,526
This young man
didn't leave your house?

489
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:27,648
No.

490
00:28:27,849 --> 00:28:30,855
You're new,
you didn't know.

491
00:28:31,055 --> 00:28:34,782
This young man could have been
a relative or a friend.

492
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:35,744
Oh...

493
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:37,708
Loving is not forbidden.

494
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:40,313
If I ever love,
it will be my fiancé.

495
00:28:40,514 --> 00:28:44,321
And I'll walk on his arm
for all the world to see.

496
00:28:44,502 --> 00:28:45,924
I won't be ashamed.

497
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:49,131
I believe
and congratulate you.

498
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:51,335
All that's left for me to do
to apologize.

499
00:28:54,681 --> 00:28:55,784
Monsieur...

500
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:00,954
Well done.

501
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:03,078
Very gallant.

502
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:05,884
This little
is not like the others.

503
00:29:06,085 --> 00:29:08,249
You think you know
women,

504
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:11,856
but one day one will come
that will avenge the others.

505
00:29:21,675 --> 00:29:25,122
Watch out!
Are you trying to asphyxiate us?

506
00:29:25,783 --> 00:29:27,286
Close the window.

507
00:29:27,487 --> 00:29:30,613
We're entitled to sunshine
and fresh air.

508
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:34,781
Even on Sundays?
Slaves!

509
00:29:36,344 --> 00:29:39,230
This Mouret has sworn
to drive us crazy.

510
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,955
He imagines we'll cry for mercy,

511
00:29:42,136 --> 00:29:43,598
we'll go away.

512
00:29:44,721 --> 00:29:47,727
It's an egg yolk
beaten in garlic stock.

513
00:29:47,927 --> 00:29:50,131
This'll fix you up.
No. Thanks, Dad.

514
00:29:50,312 --> 00:29:51,856
Bell.

515
00:29:52,036 --> 00:29:54,220
Here are the last of the conspirators.

516
00:29:54,421 --> 00:29:58,549
I'm planning a master stroke
that will leave Mouret out in the cold.

517
00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:00,473
It'll do you good.

518
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,799
Hello, Uncle.
You? What do you want?

519
00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:06,003
I'm the one who called her.

520
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:08,208
Leave us alone.
You have business downstairs.

521
00:30:08,408 --> 00:30:11,414
Denise will keep me company.
Do you think I look different?

522
00:30:11,614 --> 00:30:13,658
But it's nothing.
Just a little tired.

523
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:15,823
It's morale
is affected.

524
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:19,350
I've got good news for you:
you're getting married.

525
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,596
I sold the house in Rambouillet.
It will be your dowry.

526
00:30:22,776 --> 00:30:25,882
BAUDU! BAUDU! BAUDU!

527
00:30:26,063 --> 00:30:27,445
I'll be right down.

528
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:30,732
Are you happy?

529
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:33,898
It's too late.
Colomban has grown tired of waiting.

530
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:36,704
He loves another:
Mlle Prunaire.

531
00:30:36,884 --> 00:30:38,547
You can't love Clara.

532
00:30:38,748 --> 00:30:41,915
She may have dazzled him for a moment,
but it will come back to you.

533
00:30:42,115 --> 00:30:44,560
Think so?
He loves you.

534
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,766
You'll have to forgive him.
Do you want me to talk to him?

535
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:48,888
Oh no.

536
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:53,498
But if you were telling the truth,
I think I'd be cured.

537
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,221
Fracas.

538
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:58,026
What's going on?
An attack?

539
00:30:58,227 --> 00:31:02,315
They dig a tunnel
to reunite the old stores.

540
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:06,002
It's like this all the time.
Hellish.

541
00:31:06,202 --> 00:31:10,892
The time has come
to react against Mouret,

542
00:31:11,072 --> 00:31:13,176
the enemy of us all.

543
00:31:13,377 --> 00:31:17,384
He wants to nibble us all.
I say, "Enough is enough."

544
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:18,466
Hello.

545
00:31:18,707 --> 00:31:20,831
Ladies...
What are you up to?

546
00:31:21,032 --> 00:31:26,323
Mr. Mouret knows
of the little plot you're cooking up.

547
00:31:26,503 --> 00:31:29,289
But he sends me to you as a friend.

548
00:31:31,012 --> 00:31:34,258
It's an unequal struggle.
You'll break your back.

549
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:35,461
We'll see.

550
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:38,908
I've come to make you
an honest proposal.

551
00:31:39,108 --> 00:31:43,677
We can buy back your funds
at very attractive prices.

552
00:31:43,877 --> 00:31:46,803
What do you have to say?
Your business is doing badly.

553
00:31:47,003 --> 00:31:49,889
Say...
Our fault, I grant you.

554
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:53,095
Well, we'll buy it from you
30,000 francs.

555
00:31:53,276 --> 00:31:54,498
"30,000 francs?

556
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:55,620
Enough is enough!

557
00:31:55,861 --> 00:31:58,626
I'll give you 50,000 F
for your store.

558
00:31:58,807 --> 00:31:59,588
"50 000" ?

559
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:01,231
I won't do it!
60 000.

560
00:32:01,432 --> 00:32:02,754
Never!
80.

561
00:32:02,935 --> 00:32:04,438
Not even for 1 million!

562
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:08,726
Mr. Vincard is less stubborn,
and Mme Bédoré would accept 30,000 F.

563
00:32:08,926 --> 00:32:11,411
Get out of here!
This is my house!

564
00:32:11,612 --> 00:32:14,058
We're not for sale.
So be it.

565
00:32:14,258 --> 00:32:17,344
If you come back here,
watch your back!

566
00:32:17,584 --> 00:32:19,789
Capitulate
at the moment of victory!

567
00:32:19,969 --> 00:32:21,672
30,000 F is a lot of money.

568
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:25,921
This visit proves
that they are afraid.

569
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:27,845
Maybe you're right.

570
00:32:28,045 --> 00:32:30,730
You have to beat Mouret
with his own weapons:

571
00:32:30,931 --> 00:32:34,177
sell cheaper
than he does.

572
00:32:34,377 --> 00:32:38,185
Let's modernize our stores,
let's advertise...

573
00:32:38,385 --> 00:32:40,910
"Advertising"?
Yes, advertising.

574
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:42,233
We have to fight.

575
00:32:42,413 --> 00:32:44,798
Yes. But with what money?

576
00:32:44,998 --> 00:32:48,846
Let's scrape our drawers,
let's make a joint fund.

577
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,495
The more employees he has,
the more glasses I sell.

578
00:32:53,675 --> 00:32:55,579
Ah, the selfish one.

579
00:32:55,779 --> 00:32:58,144
Since you're generous,
prove it.

580
00:32:58,324 --> 00:32:59,867
I'll take your word for it.

581
00:33:00,068 --> 00:33:02,674
I sold my house
in Rambouillet for 60,000 F.

582
00:33:02,874 --> 00:33:05,720
They are at your disposal.
Well spoken.

583
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,004
VIVE BAUDU.

584
00:33:08,185 --> 00:33:09,848
Uncork the champagne.

585
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,054
You're just going to leave
without saying a word?

586
00:33:13,235 --> 00:33:14,818
Geneviève's dowry.

587
00:33:15,018 --> 00:33:17,303
We're going to crush
le Bonheur des dames.

588
00:33:17,503 --> 00:33:20,789
And Geneviève's.
Her wedding is only delayed.

589
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,635
Her dowry,
will be doubled, tripled.

590
00:33:23,815 --> 00:33:27,002
The whole neighborhood will be invited.

591
00:33:27,202 --> 00:33:31,130
And the cars in the motorcade
will pass over the ruins of the store.

592
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,372
BAUDU! BAUDU!

593
00:33:32,573 --> 00:33:35,258
Tell her to be patient.
She'll die.

594
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:40,147
A la mort du Bonheur des dames.
A la mort du Bonheur des dames.

595
00:33:40,328 --> 00:33:43,474
A LA MORT DU BONHEUR DES DAMES!

596
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:51,370
They want war?
They'll get it.

597
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,577
We'll sell each item
10 cents cheaper.

598
00:33:54,757 --> 00:33:55,819
It's ruin.

599
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:57,583
They'll get tired first.

600
00:33:57,763 --> 00:33:58,985
You're dismissed.

601
00:33:59,186 --> 00:34:03,194
You look like one.
I'm interested in profits.

602
00:34:03,394 --> 00:34:06,199
You'll make up for it
on future revenues,

603
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,243
when we've
eliminate Baudu.

604
00:34:08,424 --> 00:34:10,007
Just a moment.

605
00:34:10,207 --> 00:34:11,570
I've got an idea.
What else?

606
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,133
This is the coup de grâce.

607
00:34:13,374 --> 00:34:16,900
We're going to change
the layout of the shelves.

608
00:34:17,101 --> 00:34:20,548
Hardware
instead of crockery.

609
00:34:20,748 --> 00:34:23,073
The first to the second...
Execution.

610
00:34:23,273 --> 00:34:25,598
It's pure madness.
No, it isn't.

611
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:29,726
Customers get into the habit
to go to the department that interests them.

612
00:34:29,926 --> 00:34:32,411
now,
she'll have to look.

613
00:34:32,611 --> 00:34:36,780
And then she'll be tempted
by new articles.

614
00:34:36,961 --> 00:34:38,664
We'll sell twice as much.

615
00:34:38,865 --> 00:34:40,788
And at a loss?
That's nice.

616
00:34:42,592 --> 00:34:44,956
What do you think of my display?
Do you like it?

617
00:34:45,137 --> 00:34:47,281
Bravo, Madame Bédoré.

618
00:34:54,696 --> 00:34:57,621
Need a hand?
I'm good. Thanks for your help.

619
00:35:00,547 --> 00:35:03,994
Ah, very well.
We do our best.

620
00:35:09,044 --> 00:35:11,889
I posted the prices,
too.

621
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,214
I'd expect nothing less
from you.

622
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,635
They sell their flannel for 4.60.

623
00:35:24,816 --> 00:35:28,042
Displays ours at 4.55.

624
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:42,310
Look at the frame.

625
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,196
You can touch it, ladies.
It's indestructible.

626
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:46,759
Good afternoon, ma'am.

627
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:49,484
You won't find it anywhere else.
6 m.

628
00:35:49,664 --> 00:35:51,608
Colomban, 6 m for Madame.

629
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:53,853
I wouldn't want
to be Mouret.

630
00:35:54,614 --> 00:35:58,021
4,50 ? Are you sure?
And prettier than this one.

631
00:35:58,221 --> 00:36:00,987
You won't find
higher quality.

632
00:36:01,187 --> 00:36:03,191
To happiness,
it's thicker.

633
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:06,117
But it's the same one.
The same supplier.

634
00:36:06,317 --> 00:36:09,003
So
they present it better.

635
00:36:09,204 --> 00:36:11,608
Well, go ahead,
and leave me alone.

636
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:15,536
Colomban,
pass me the 4.45 label.

637
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:18,141
Everything has changed.
I can't find my way around anymore.

638
00:36:18,322 --> 00:36:20,145
Umbrella holders?

639
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:22,510
Porcelain,
glassware.

640
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:26,277
Bamboo, in the China department.
In copper, in the household section.

641
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:28,642
Wall-mounted,
with hardware.

642
00:36:28,842 --> 00:36:32,489
And wooden models,
with a variety of furniture.

643
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,614
Thank you for your time.
You're welcome.

644
00:36:43,772 --> 00:36:45,395
What do you do?

645
00:36:45,595 --> 00:36:47,799
I'll get her dressed.
What do you say?

646
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,765
It's the best way
to show off our models.

647
00:36:50,966 --> 00:36:53,491
Models?
Like in a workshop?

648
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:55,054
Are you crazy?

649
00:36:55,294 --> 00:36:57,499
I think the idea
an excellent idea.

650
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,746
Let me give you a hand.
Reminds me of my early days.

651
00:37:00,946 --> 00:37:03,311
I was a simple calico,
to begin with.

652
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:05,595
All the hope
is yours.

653
00:37:06,197 --> 00:37:08,361
Can I help you?
Thank you for your help.

654
00:37:10,485 --> 00:37:14,012
You love your job.
That's great.

655
00:37:14,212 --> 00:37:16,577
How can you work
without passion?

656
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:20,184
Your friends are thinking
time to get out.

657
00:37:20,384 --> 00:37:23,030
They don't have
your motivations.

658
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,595
They receive nothing
on profits.

659
00:37:25,775 --> 00:37:27,158
Of course

660
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:29,362
Forgive me
for being so frank.

661
00:37:29,562 --> 00:37:33,250
I congratulate you.
I like you very much.

662
00:37:35,013 --> 00:37:38,299
M. Mouret is very gallant
with the female staff.

663
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,664
And who is this
this young person?

664
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:42,909
A simple saleswoman.

665
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:46,276
Her latest whim, probably.
I didn't say that.

666
00:37:46,477 --> 00:37:49,963
He cares a lot.
Too much.

667
00:37:50,164 --> 00:37:54,693
You will?
I'll take care of that, too.

668
00:37:55,394 --> 00:37:56,897
Madame, what a surprise.

669
00:37:57,097 --> 00:37:59,101
Unpleasant?
Happy.

670
00:37:59,302 --> 00:38:01,827
Mme Desforges wants a cape.
Excellent.

671
00:38:02,027 --> 00:38:04,432
Madame Aurélie...
No. Mademoiselle.

672
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:06,756
You're interested
interest.

673
00:38:06,957 --> 00:38:09,001
Miss Baudu,
take care of Madame.

674
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:10,804
If you want to follow me...

675
00:38:11,586 --> 00:38:12,928
See you soon.

676
00:38:13,129 --> 00:38:15,333
You've been neglecting me
for some time now.

677
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:17,938
I'm only thinking of you
and your deadlines.

678
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:19,782
Monsieur!
Madame?

679
00:38:20,463 --> 00:38:22,427
There is no
porcelain department.

680
00:38:22,627 --> 00:38:25,713
Yes, it is. He's on the second floor.
That scared me.

681
00:38:25,914 --> 00:38:28,599
You think...
It's for a trade.

682
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,806
If you can't see
that this collar is too narrow,

683
00:38:31,987 --> 00:38:33,570
you're blind.

684
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,095
It has
distinction.

685
00:38:36,295 --> 00:38:40,263
So don't talk
what you don't know.

686
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:41,626
Monsieur Mouret...

687
00:38:42,868 --> 00:38:45,153
she tries to persuade me
that it suits me.

688
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:47,197
Is she stupid?

689
00:38:47,377 --> 00:38:48,279
I was explaining...

690
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:51,565
Say right now
that I'm an idiot.

691
00:38:51,766 --> 00:38:55,653
Such impertinence.
I thought you were more difficult.

692
00:38:55,854 --> 00:38:59,260
If Mr. Mouret requires it,
I'll apologize.

693
00:38:59,461 --> 00:39:02,266
For that to happen
hurt me.

694
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:05,432
But for me, your opinion
is of no importance.

695
00:39:05,633 --> 00:39:08,478
I'll be seeing you.
I'll buy a cape somewhere else.

696
00:39:10,162 --> 00:39:12,406
I'm sorry, sir.
It's not your fault.

697
00:39:12,606 --> 00:39:15,773
The customer is queen.
Without abusing her privilege.

698
00:39:15,973 --> 00:39:19,140
You have my full confidence
and friendship.

699
00:39:19,341 --> 00:39:21,585
You've caught
the boss's eye.

700
00:39:21,765 --> 00:39:23,228
Hopes are high.

701
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:27,276
It's been a long time since I pointed out
your qualities to Mr. Mouret.

702
00:39:28,198 --> 00:39:30,563
You did well
to blow that poser's nose.

703
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,286
Good for you. Very good.

704
00:39:32,506 --> 00:39:33,969
Unfortunate incident.

705
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,336
Some customers...
This one is a creditor.

706
00:39:37,536 --> 00:39:42,226
The delay we were going to ask for,
don't count on it.

707
00:39:42,426 --> 00:39:44,510
I'll pay.
With what money?

708
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,273
I'll manage.

709
00:39:46,474 --> 00:39:48,919
Our competitors
are out of business.

710
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,327
I'm giving up my salary.
You too, of course.

711
00:39:53,528 --> 00:39:55,692
No, you don't.
I don't agree anymore.

712
00:39:55,892 --> 00:39:58,177
It would be a drop of water
in the sea.

713
00:39:58,377 --> 00:40:02,465
We need to take
drastic measures.

714
00:40:02,646 --> 00:40:04,349
You have to...

715
00:40:04,549 --> 00:40:07,356
Listen to
You're giving me carte blanche?

716
00:40:08,759 --> 00:40:10,402
Please go ahead.
All right, then.

717
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:26,193
This is bad.
It's a disgrace.

718
00:40:26,393 --> 00:40:28,878
They'll end up making us
to eat...

719
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:31,403
It already is.
We should complain.

720
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:34,609
Miss Baudu should
talk to the boss.

721
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:38,216
They have other things to do,
when they're together.

722
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:39,379
Miss Prunaire...

723
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:42,184
Isn't Mlle Baudu
the boss's mistress?

724
00:40:42,364 --> 00:40:43,346
Of course not.

725
00:40:43,547 --> 00:40:45,831
No one will have Denise
to have fun.

726
00:40:46,032 --> 00:40:48,036
But you can get it
for 100 cents.

727
00:40:48,236 --> 00:40:50,480
Say it again.
Yes, 100 sous. And you with it.

728
00:40:50,661 --> 00:40:51,683
You lying bitch!

729
00:40:51,864 --> 00:40:53,888
Hush, hush...

730
00:41:03,868 --> 00:41:06,874
If I sign a treaty
despite my reluctance,

731
00:41:07,074 --> 00:41:10,400
is that my situation
is exceptional.

732
00:41:11,443 --> 00:41:15,050
I've sold all my merchandise.
I need to renew my stock.

733
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,657
Business is good.
Very well.

734
00:41:18,857 --> 00:41:21,142
The more I sell,
the more I lose.

735
00:41:21,342 --> 00:41:24,949
Only, Mouret
loses 10 times as much as I do.

736
00:41:25,129 --> 00:41:26,672
He'll die for it.

737
00:41:26,873 --> 00:41:30,640
And at that point,
I go back to the old prices.

738
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:33,245
And to me, the profits.
You think so?

739
00:41:33,466 --> 00:41:34,848
You don't know a thing.

740
00:41:35,049 --> 00:41:37,253
It will dismiss
over 300 employees.

741
00:41:37,434 --> 00:41:39,499
It's the end, I tell you.

742
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:41,062
Cracking sound.

743
00:41:41,262 --> 00:41:44,829
It's an escalator
he installed against my wall.

744
00:41:45,029 --> 00:41:48,556
Thud.
A lady breaks her face.

745
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:51,522
Another one who shows her ass
to society.

746
00:41:51,702 --> 00:41:55,330
Voice bursts.

747
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:58,135
Hear that?
The saleswomen.

748
00:41:58,336 --> 00:42:02,103
Sales assistants who argue
with customers.

749
00:42:02,283 --> 00:42:04,628
That's a good sign.

750
00:42:04,828 --> 00:42:07,634
It's as if I were giving you
gold bars.

751
00:42:09,397 --> 00:42:12,283
Monsieur Lafont,
it is forbidden to sit down.

752
00:42:12,483 --> 00:42:14,728
You'll
checkout.

753
00:42:18,214 --> 00:42:21,421
How much is that?
148.

754
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:25,228
"148" ?
We're still 52 short.

755
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:34,768
Monsieur Grimaut, you...
You look terrible.

756
00:42:34,948 --> 00:42:36,932
You'll have to check out.

757
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:46,351
There's Bourdoncle.
What's the matter with you?

758
00:42:46,531 --> 00:42:47,954
Nothing.

759
00:42:48,134 --> 00:42:49,196
Oh...

760
00:42:49,397 --> 00:42:51,601
Quickly,
into a fitting room.

761
00:42:55,689 --> 00:42:58,535
Is she ill?
No.

762
00:42:58,735 --> 00:43:02,943
Mlle Cugnot is a little pregnant.
"Pregnant?

763
00:43:04,306 --> 00:43:05,949
You are...
Monsieur...

764
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,915
No girl seduced.
I'm married.

765
00:43:09,095 --> 00:43:11,560
"Married? Since when?

766
00:43:11,761 --> 00:43:14,527
For 3 months.
"3 months? And with whom?

767
00:43:14,707 --> 00:43:15,489
I...

768
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:18,014
A friend of mine
who doesn't work here.

769
00:43:18,194 --> 00:43:19,577
A good boy.

770
00:43:19,777 --> 00:43:22,943
"It is forbidden to marry
without notifying management."

771
00:43:23,124 --> 00:43:25,108
You'll have to check out.

772
00:43:25,308 --> 00:43:28,595
These rules give you
all the rights!

773
00:43:28,795 --> 00:43:31,801
I will not tolerate...
Just throw me out.

774
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:34,326
You think you're
very protected,

775
00:43:34,506 --> 00:43:36,129
but don't be fooled.

776
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:38,734
First and final warning.

777
00:43:39,255 --> 00:43:41,901
Let's get to work.
And smile.

778
00:43:43,223 --> 00:43:46,189
I have an errand to run.
I'll be back in 15 minutes.

779
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:47,391
I've had enough.

780
00:43:47,592 --> 00:43:51,600
If he doesn't pay me the 30,000,
I'll put his drafts into circulation.

781
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:55,808
In other words, I'm executing it.
It will be bankruptcy.

782
00:43:56,609 --> 00:43:59,134
I must confess, Madame,
I'm surprised by your visit.

783
00:43:59,335 --> 00:44:01,901
I came here as a friend,
Monsieur Baudu.

784
00:44:02,081 --> 00:44:03,063
As an ally.

785
00:44:03,264 --> 00:44:06,430
Rather say that Mouret
sent you to spy on me.

786
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:09,075
You've come to see
if I succumb soon.

787
00:44:09,275 --> 00:44:11,560
What does it take
to convince you?

788
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,327
I hate Monsieur Mouret.
Yes, I was his friend.

789
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:19,455
But when he got
what he wanted: my buildings,

790
00:44:19,636 --> 00:44:20,698
he betrayed me.

791
00:44:20,898 --> 00:44:23,623
I have only one idea:
revenge.

792
00:44:23,804 --> 00:44:25,748
I know he wants to ruin you.

793
00:44:25,948 --> 00:44:27,752
I've come to give you
my help.

794
00:44:27,992 --> 00:44:30,838
Thank you for your help,
but I don't need anyone.

795
00:44:31,038 --> 00:44:33,924
It's a fight to the death,
but a personal one.

796
00:44:34,124 --> 00:44:36,088
So you're
sure you're going to win?

797
00:44:36,268 --> 00:44:39,294
I believe in justice.

798
00:44:39,475 --> 00:44:40,978
It would be wrong of me to insist.

799
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,344
I came
to offer you some money.

800
00:44:44,545 --> 00:44:46,949
In any case, Mouret
is out of breath.

801
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:50,798
Just a little more effort,
and you'll win.

802
00:44:50,998 --> 00:44:53,122
Excuse me
for this step.

803
00:44:53,303 --> 00:44:55,166
You have my deepest sympathy.

804
00:44:55,367 --> 00:44:59,094
Please understand, ma'am,
that I cannot accept gifts.

805
00:44:59,274 --> 00:45:00,617
A question of dignity.

806
00:45:00,817 --> 00:45:04,585
Oh, Monsieur Baudu,
far be it from me to humiliate you.

807
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,591
We both hate
the same man.

808
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:11,599
We could have united
to bring him down.

809
00:45:11,799 --> 00:45:15,647
You can't possibly know
what it is to hate a woman.

810
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:18,773
How do you propose
offer me money?

811
00:45:18,973 --> 00:45:22,179
I don't know...
An advance, a loan,

812
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,305
a guarantee
on your building

813
00:45:25,486 --> 00:45:26,869
or your fund.

814
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:29,554
Old Elbeuf? Never.

815
00:45:29,754 --> 00:45:32,439
I refused Mouret 60,000 F
for the building.

816
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,607
He could take it off your hands
for less.

817
00:45:35,807 --> 00:45:38,492
That's its purpose.
You know that.

818
00:45:38,693 --> 00:45:40,095
I'm well aware of that,
by God.

819
00:45:40,296 --> 00:45:43,502
You know, I'm not
a businesswoman.

820
00:45:43,703 --> 00:45:45,666
I'm angry
with numbers.

821
00:45:45,847 --> 00:45:48,352
But I'm intuitive,

822
00:45:48,552 --> 00:45:52,199
and despite your pride
to hide your difficulties from me,

823
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,484
I can guess.

824
00:45:54,684 --> 00:45:57,890
I'm buying your house
to save it from Mouret.

825
00:45:58,091 --> 00:46:01,658
I promise to sell it back to you
whenever you want

826
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:04,503
at the same price
and without any profit.

827
00:46:04,704 --> 00:46:09,032
I will be rewarded
by Mouret's demise.

828
00:46:09,213 --> 00:46:10,114
20 000.

829
00:46:10,355 --> 00:46:13,641
Are you all right?
No, I can't be.

830
00:46:13,842 --> 00:46:16,006
What is it now?
Gaujan.

831
00:46:16,186 --> 00:46:17,729
Tell him I'm coming.

832
00:46:20,835 --> 00:46:22,419
30 000.

833
00:46:23,441 --> 00:46:25,185
It's worth much more.

834
00:46:25,385 --> 00:46:28,111
But since you'll be buying it back
at the same price.

835
00:46:28,311 --> 00:46:31,117
I've prepared a paper
just in case.

836
00:46:31,297 --> 00:46:34,684
This close is planned.

837
00:46:34,884 --> 00:46:38,331
I'm not a woman of money,
but a wounded woman

838
00:46:38,531 --> 00:46:41,377
who just wants
revenge on a cad.

839
00:46:41,577 --> 00:46:44,182
Say bandit,
a shark.

840
00:46:44,383 --> 00:46:46,427
But this time,
we've got him.

841
00:46:46,627 --> 00:46:49,112
Just sign here,
below.

842
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:54,362
We also put
"read and approved", I believe.

843
00:46:56,086 --> 00:46:59,172
You'll have to excuse me,
I don't know anything about it.

844
00:46:59,412 --> 00:47:02,097
What's up?
Is it for today?

845
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:03,941
Ah...

846
00:47:07,087 --> 00:47:07,909
See you soon.

847
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:09,473
Goodbye.

848
00:47:13,441 --> 00:47:15,244
Look, I've been patient,
I've been patient...

849
00:47:15,444 --> 00:47:18,691
And you've been rewarded.
Here's your 30,000 F.

850
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,300
I never doubted,
believe me.

851
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,666
An old customer like you...
Always at your service.

852
00:47:26,867 --> 00:47:30,394
Here you go.
I'll sign a few more for you.

853
00:47:30,594 --> 00:47:33,760
You deliver to me
60,000 francs worth of merchandise.

854
00:47:33,961 --> 00:47:37,568
I'm going to sell like crazy,
make Mouret die.

855
00:47:37,808 --> 00:47:41,616
Despite our losses,
we'll settle our debts.

856
00:47:41,816 --> 00:47:44,381
But then there's
Monday's deadline.

857
00:47:44,582 --> 00:47:48,349
You were supposed to get an extension.
Mme Desforges refuses.

858
00:47:48,549 --> 00:47:51,355
Especially after the incident
the other day.

859
00:47:51,555 --> 00:47:54,601
Offer her 8%.
She won't see me.

860
00:47:54,782 --> 00:47:56,326
It's tomorrow, Sunday.

861
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:58,690
You could pay him a visit.

862
00:47:58,871 --> 00:48:01,897
The chore is not unpleasant.

863
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,742
Far from it.

864
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:13,720
- Still here, miss?

865
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,605
I helped Mrs. Aurélie
finish her inventory.

866
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:22,136
Would you do me a favor?
Yes. If it's in my power.

867
00:48:22,337 --> 00:48:24,341
You need
a change of scenery.

868
00:48:24,521 --> 00:48:25,824
Come and have dinner with me.

869
00:48:26,024 --> 00:48:29,631
Thank you very much.
I've already had dinner in the refectory.

870
00:48:29,831 --> 00:48:32,196
In fact, not too bad,
for once.

871
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:33,358
Well, all right.

872
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:34,841
Then come to dinner.

873
00:48:35,042 --> 00:48:37,206
But I have
I have to be home by 11.

874
00:48:37,386 --> 00:48:38,769
You will give 5 cents

875
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:39,891
to the doorman.

876
00:48:40,693 --> 00:48:43,940
Management is concerned
of the staff.

877
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,786
Go put on a dress,
I'll be waiting.

878
00:48:46,986 --> 00:48:48,389
No, sir.
Why not?

879
00:48:48,569 --> 00:48:50,513
I don't want to.

880
00:48:50,713 --> 00:48:52,236
I want to.
Let me be.

881
00:48:52,437 --> 00:48:56,284
I'll furnish an apartment for you.
You won't work anymore.

882
00:48:56,485 --> 00:48:58,849
No, thanks. I'd be bored.
I'd be bored.

883
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:02,617
A man in your life?
No. Too many women in yours.

884
00:49:02,797 --> 00:49:03,939
It's up to you.

885
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,943
Please let me go,
I beg you.

886
00:49:06,805 --> 00:49:07,947
Coughing.

887
00:49:15,001 --> 00:49:17,967
Are you free for dinner?
I wonder.

888
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:21,574
You're going to be
in a foul mood.

889
00:49:21,774 --> 00:49:25,381
I drew up a list
of staff to be made redundant.

890
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:28,107
That makes 199.

891
00:49:28,307 --> 00:49:30,793
This is not
an account, that, 199.

892
00:49:30,993 --> 00:49:34,400
You will tell Mlle Baudu
that she has been appointed second.

893
00:49:36,023 --> 00:49:52,956
...

894
00:49:56,002 --> 00:49:58,207
How's that?
One more turn, Denise.

895
00:49:58,407 --> 00:50:00,732
It's the 6th.
You have to be reasonable.

896
00:50:00,932 --> 00:50:04,339
What are we going to do now?
You're going to taste it.

897
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:06,102
What about your work?

898
00:50:06,964 --> 00:50:09,268
You can't go.

899
00:50:09,469 --> 00:50:12,675
Why do you ask?
Jean told me it was big.

900
00:50:12,896 --> 00:50:14,158
Tell me, Denise.

901
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:16,322
Once upon a time
a gentleman

902
00:50:16,523 --> 00:50:20,131
who, walking
in front of poorly lit stores,

903
00:50:20,311 --> 00:50:21,533
decided to change that.

904
00:50:21,734 --> 00:50:24,339
Was he Prince Charming?
Yes.

905
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:26,022
With his magic wand,

906
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,307
he built
a palace from the ground

907
00:50:28,507 --> 00:50:31,713
full of light,
and toys.

908
00:50:31,894 --> 00:50:33,517
Have you seen the prince?

909
00:50:33,717 --> 00:50:36,202
Yes. He often comes
to visit his subjects.

910
00:50:36,403 --> 00:50:38,527
What's it like?
Is it pretty?

911
00:50:38,727 --> 00:50:41,773
He's very likeable,
very attractive,

912
00:50:41,954 --> 00:50:43,617
always very cheerful.

913
00:50:43,817 --> 00:50:47,104
Everyone greets him low,
but passes him carelessly.

914
00:50:47,284 --> 00:50:48,466
He smiles at me.

915
00:50:48,707 --> 00:50:51,312
You're his favorite,
say, Denise?

916
00:50:55,881 --> 00:50:58,526
You're his favorite,
say, Denise?

917
00:51:00,189 --> 00:51:02,173
Orchestra.

918
00:51:18,747 --> 00:51:19,568
Squeaking.

919
00:51:19,749 --> 00:51:23,937
Laughter.

920
00:51:29,608 --> 00:51:34,558
Applause.

921
00:52:26,621 --> 00:52:29,146
Like this,
you like acrobats?

922
00:52:29,326 --> 00:52:30,428
Do you mind?

923
00:52:30,629 --> 00:52:33,073
What you offer me
enchants me.

924
00:52:33,254 --> 00:52:34,196
In what way?

925
00:52:34,436 --> 00:52:37,723
You're taking me
in a bellowing.

926
00:52:37,923 --> 00:52:40,369
Does that shock you?
No, it doesn't.

927
00:52:40,569 --> 00:52:43,295
I was expecting
an excess of tenderness

928
00:52:43,495 --> 00:52:45,779
I was about to resist.
to resist.

929
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,423
As you can see...
Oh!

930
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:51,591
Just to justify
my reputation as an honest woman.

931
00:52:53,294 --> 00:52:54,597
Too late.

932
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:56,921
But perhaps
you're concerned

933
00:52:57,102 --> 00:52:58,965
to think about love?

934
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:00,889
"Concerned", me?
Why should you be?

935
00:53:01,069 --> 00:53:03,214
Tomorrow's deadline.

936
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:05,658
You think of everything.
Of course you do.

937
00:53:05,859 --> 00:53:08,263
You want
to ask me for a delay,

938
00:53:08,464 --> 00:53:10,668
and you don't know
how to attack.

939
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:15,197
And you would resist
just enough

940
00:53:15,397 --> 00:53:18,163
to justify
your reputation.

941
00:53:18,363 --> 00:53:21,850
I'm prepared to grant you
a one-month extension.

942
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:24,135
How much is this going to cost me?

943
00:53:24,315 --> 00:53:25,297
Oh...

944
00:53:25,537 --> 00:53:28,905
7%, as usual.
The usual rate.

945
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:32,632
I'd like to ask you
a small favor.

946
00:53:32,813 --> 00:53:34,396
Granted in advance.

947
00:53:34,596 --> 00:53:36,760
You fire
this little saleswoman.

948
00:53:36,941 --> 00:53:38,844
You're above that.

949
00:53:39,025 --> 00:53:40,688
I'd like to ask you a favor.

950
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:43,373
Don't make me
to make it an obligation.

951
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:44,736
I refuse.

952
00:53:45,798 --> 00:53:47,582
Too bad for you.

953
00:53:47,782 --> 00:53:49,826
It'll cost me
what it will cost me.

954
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:52,632
It'll cost you
Baudu's house.

955
00:53:52,852 --> 00:53:53,954
Where's the report?

956
00:53:54,154 --> 00:53:58,563
Baudu borrowed money from me
that he can't pay back.

957
00:53:58,743 --> 00:54:00,046
So she's mine.

958
00:54:00,246 --> 00:54:03,854
You did?
I couldn't resist.

959
00:54:04,054 --> 00:54:07,300
I know how much it meant to you.
I wanted to give it to you.

960
00:54:07,501 --> 00:54:09,505
At what price?
80 000.

961
00:54:09,685 --> 00:54:10,988
How much do you earn?

962
00:54:11,188 --> 00:54:14,075
Isn't the most important thing
to get what you want?

963
00:54:14,275 --> 00:54:17,000
You want this house,
and I...

964
00:54:17,201 --> 00:54:19,726
I don't want to see
that little girl.

965
00:54:19,926 --> 00:54:24,255
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't make that face.

966
00:54:24,435 --> 00:54:26,940
Applause.

967
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,184
You're right.

968
00:54:29,385 --> 00:54:32,030
They're charming,
these acrobats.

969
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:35,236
Drum rolls
and applause.

970
00:54:55,436 --> 00:54:58,121
I present to you
your new second.

971
00:54:58,301 --> 00:55:00,205
Keep working.

972
00:55:00,386 --> 00:55:01,649
She got this job

973
00:55:01,849 --> 00:55:05,296
thanks to his initiative
initiative and leadership.

974
00:55:05,496 --> 00:55:08,783
I hope you'll make it easy
him an easy task.

975
00:55:08,983 --> 00:55:12,510
Mademoiselle,
no brooch on the blouse.

976
00:55:12,691 --> 00:55:15,396
First and final warning.

977
00:55:15,877 --> 00:55:17,079
Monsieur...
Yes ?

978
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,324
Is this a joke?
No.

979
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:22,570
I'd rather be a saleswoman
than second in the cellar.

980
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:25,856
You are free to refuse
and resign.

981
00:55:26,037 --> 00:55:27,540
Do I owe it to you?

982
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,906
No, mademoiselle.
It belongs to Mr Mouret himself.

983
00:55:31,107 --> 00:55:34,433
He'd rather
not to see you again.

984
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:46,697
Is Madame Desforges in?
Do you have an appointment?

985
00:55:46,898 --> 00:55:49,945
I was just...
What's this about?

986
00:55:50,145 --> 00:55:53,952
Announce Mr Baudu.
I'll see if Madame is in.

987
00:56:11,627 --> 00:56:14,593
Madame has left
a commission for you.

988
00:56:14,793 --> 00:56:18,040
"Regarding your building,
please contact Mr Mouret.

989
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,803
"He has all the power."

990
00:56:20,004 --> 00:56:21,807
"Mouret?
Madame assigned her claim to him.

991
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:25,053
He is now your
your landlord.

992
00:56:26,396 --> 00:56:28,099
The exit is this way.

993
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:45,014
Have you come to contemplate
your work?

994
00:56:45,214 --> 00:56:48,020
A murderer returns
to the scene of the crime.

995
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,542
You should be proud:

996
00:56:49,723 --> 00:56:51,386
Quinette filed for bankruptcy,

997
00:56:51,586 --> 00:56:53,590
Tatin is in receivership
liquidation,

998
00:56:53,771 --> 00:56:55,434
Vincard went bankrupt,

999
00:56:55,634 --> 00:56:58,961
Bouras wanted to kill himself
in despair.

1000
00:57:01,005 --> 00:57:03,410
Fortunately
I didn't follow you.

1001
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:06,897
You've done very well.
A real hunting ground.

1002
00:57:07,097 --> 00:57:09,662
2 pints of red!
There you go.

1003
00:57:42,127 --> 00:57:44,171
What the
this?

1004
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:50,022
Bailiff's certificate.

1005
00:57:50,223 --> 00:57:53,629
Mouret bought back the drafts
signed in Gaujan.

1006
00:57:54,691 --> 00:57:55,753
He did?

1007
00:57:55,954 --> 00:57:58,038
He sues you
in bankruptcy.

1008
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:00,964
The wretch!

1009
00:58:02,507 --> 00:58:04,490
Failli, moi, Baudu?

1010
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:08,458
My poor Colomban,

1011
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:11,986
I wanted to give you
a prosperous house...

1012
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:16,996
I'm too old
to continue the fight.

1013
00:58:17,818 --> 00:58:19,641
I'm passing the torch to you.

1014
00:58:19,842 --> 00:58:22,286
You're young,
you can succeed.

1015
00:58:22,467 --> 00:58:24,851
With what?

1016
00:58:25,032 --> 00:58:26,936
You have savings.

1017
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:30,222
What I paid in your name
at the Savings Bank.

1018
00:58:30,422 --> 00:58:34,029
You'll pay Mouret,
you'll pay Gaujan.

1019
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:38,358
I have a rich cousin.
I'll borrow from him.

1020
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:41,925
We still have
loyal customers.

1021
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:44,209
With Geneviève,
you will adapt

1022
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:46,774
to the needs
of modern commerce.

1023
00:58:47,837 --> 00:58:49,941
All is not lost.

1024
00:58:50,141 --> 00:58:53,708
I'll have you married in no time.
What do you say?

1025
00:58:56,053 --> 00:58:56,835
Speak up!

1026
00:58:57,036 --> 00:58:59,200
Don't look at me
like a fool.

1027
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,208
I give you my store.
I give you my daughter.

1028
00:59:03,408 --> 00:59:06,093
Would you refuse,
by any chance?

1029
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,865
Please answer.
Do you think she's too poor?

1030
00:59:12,045 --> 00:59:13,147
Come on, talk.

1031
00:59:13,348 --> 00:59:16,113
I've never liked
your daughter.

1032
00:59:16,313 --> 00:59:18,037
You dare?
Oh, that's all right.

1033
00:59:18,237 --> 00:59:21,123
The store is ruined,
just like your daughter.

1034
00:59:21,303 --> 00:59:22,485
I love another.

1035
00:59:22,686 --> 00:59:25,251
She is a salesgirl
at Le Bonheur des dames.

1036
00:59:25,451 --> 00:59:28,016
For 10 years,
you've been living with us.

1037
00:59:28,217 --> 00:59:31,383
For the past 10 years,
I've thought of you as my son.

1038
00:59:31,583 --> 00:59:33,186
Get out of here!
You bet!

1039
00:59:33,367 --> 00:59:35,431
I'm offered a seat next door.

1040
00:59:35,611 --> 00:59:36,393
I'm running.

1041
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,156
Scumbag!

1042
00:59:41,302 --> 00:59:42,405
Geneviève!

1043
01:00:14,929 --> 01:00:16,993
I killed her.

1044
01:00:17,174 --> 01:00:20,039
I, Baudu, killed my daughter.

1045
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,446
I only thought of myself.
I was selfish.

1046
01:00:23,646 --> 01:00:28,135
I should have listened to Geneviève.
I can't anymore.

1047
01:00:28,336 --> 01:00:30,541
I'm an old beast,
a brute.

1048
01:00:31,583 --> 01:00:33,827
I ruined my friends,
killed my daughter.

1049
01:00:34,749 --> 01:00:37,074
- Step right up, ladies.
1,95 F.

1050
01:00:37,294 --> 01:00:39,078
Our latest innovation.

1051
01:00:39,278 --> 01:00:42,444
Sale of the week :
1,95 F.

1052
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:48,135
Please follow me.

1053
01:00:48,336 --> 01:00:50,700
What's on your mind?
No scandal.

1054
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:51,743
What's up?

1055
01:00:51,943 --> 01:00:54,668
I caught Madame
in flagrante delicto.

1056
01:00:54,869 --> 01:00:57,594
He's crazy.
You don't know who I am.

1057
01:00:57,774 --> 01:00:59,478
I know you well, Madame.

1058
01:00:59,678 --> 01:01:04,528
It would be preferable
if you returned the lace.

1059
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:05,489
But...

1060
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:09,738
Take Madame to number 3,
so we can search her.

1061
01:01:11,241 --> 01:01:12,744
I'll complain to Mr. Mouret.

1062
01:01:12,944 --> 01:01:16,712
If we're not being considerate,
please let me know.

1063
01:01:17,795 --> 01:01:19,638
Check it out, ladies.
1,95 F.

1064
01:01:25,991 --> 01:01:27,013
All done.

1065
01:01:27,373 --> 01:01:30,820
Thank you for your time.
You're dismissed.

1066
01:01:31,622 --> 01:01:34,547
It's an ambush.
Someone slipped them on me.

1067
01:01:34,748 --> 01:01:37,754
For your family's sake,
we will hush this up.

1068
01:01:37,934 --> 01:01:39,517
Here, have a seat.

1069
01:01:39,698 --> 01:01:41,922
Make yourself comfortable. Good.

1070
01:01:42,102 --> 01:01:43,886
Write to

1071
01:01:44,066 --> 01:01:45,208
Write to

1072
01:01:45,389 --> 01:01:47,653
"I stole some lace."

1073
01:01:47,854 --> 01:01:49,537
Never, never.
I'd rather die.

1074
01:01:49,737 --> 01:01:52,543
Then I'll accompany you
to the superintendent's office.

1075
01:01:53,485 --> 01:01:55,188
We will return this paper to you

1076
01:01:55,388 --> 01:01:58,675
when you bring us
1,000 francs.

1077
01:01:58,875 --> 01:02:02,923
Terrible blackmail.
That's a big word.

1078
01:02:03,124 --> 01:02:03,925
Thank you.
Thank you for your time.

1079
01:02:04,126 --> 01:02:07,894
Dated and signed.
Without it, it's...

1080
01:02:09,697 --> 01:02:12,062
Your paper
will be in good company.

1081
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:16,110
I have a collection
of society ladies' autographs.

1082
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:17,192
Greetings.

1083
01:02:17,372 --> 01:02:18,916
I'm not answering you.

1084
01:02:19,096 --> 01:02:20,719
That, madame...

1085
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:28,374
How did it go?
They apologized.

1086
01:02:28,574 --> 01:02:30,458
These misunderstandings
are appalling.

1087
01:02:32,302 --> 01:02:34,346
Open the door.
Be reasonable.

1088
01:02:34,546 --> 01:02:38,153
You can't stay.
For the last time: open.

1089
01:02:38,334 --> 01:02:39,235
What's up?

1090
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:41,640
Father Baudu went bankrupt.

1091
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:44,686
We're going to evict him
and demolish his house.

1092
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:48,213
He's barricaded himself in.
We'll find him hanged.

1093
01:02:48,754 --> 01:02:50,858
We're going to break down the door.

1094
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:54,667
- Uncle, please,
I beg you, open up!

1095
01:02:54,867 --> 01:02:57,031
- Come on, miss,
step aside.

1096
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:02,442
The first one who touches me,
I'll knock him out!

1097
01:03:02,642 --> 01:03:05,287
Tear the house down.
I won't get out!

1098
01:03:05,468 --> 01:03:07,051
I want to be buried.

1099
01:03:07,231 --> 01:03:08,654
Be reasonable.

1100
01:03:08,854 --> 01:03:10,858
I want to die here.
I want to die here.

1101
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:13,944
I want to die here!

1102
01:03:22,341 --> 01:03:23,523
Leave it alone. It's all right. It's all right.

1103
01:03:23,704 --> 01:03:24,485
Take him away.

1104
01:03:24,686 --> 01:03:27,611
Come, Uncle.
No. I want to see.

1105
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:32,220
No more...
It's all over.

1106
01:03:32,421 --> 01:03:35,066
Come on, Baudu,
cheer up.

1107
01:03:35,246 --> 01:03:36,429
Let's go to my place.

1108
01:03:36,629 --> 01:03:39,596
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll take care of him.

1109
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:04,525
I will have lost everything:
daughter, home, health.

1110
01:04:05,366 --> 01:04:08,533
And the other builds,
grows, triumphs.

1111
01:04:09,394 --> 01:04:11,178
There is no justice.

1112
01:04:12,761 --> 01:04:14,865
I want to go,

1113
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:17,470
run away from this noise.

1114
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:21,919
These workers are murdering
my neighborhood with their pickaxes.

1115
01:04:23,722 --> 01:04:26,007
As soon as I can
stand on my own two feet,

1116
01:04:26,188 --> 01:04:28,252
I'm off to Valognes

1117
01:04:29,254 --> 01:04:33,022
end my days among good people
good people, far from this jungle.

1118
01:04:35,587 --> 01:04:38,472
You too, Denise,
you should leave with me.

1119
01:04:40,677 --> 01:04:45,646
But you prefer to exhaust yourself
in your airless basement,

1120
01:04:46,769 --> 01:04:49,774
in this cellar,
doing this stupid job.

1121
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,385
Yet you are
a good girl, Denise,

1122
01:04:55,586 --> 01:04:58,351
but you'll let me go
on my own,

1123
01:04:58,532 --> 01:05:00,355
old and abandoned.

1124
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,886
Is Mouret holding you back?
Is it?

1125
01:05:06,066 --> 01:05:07,569
So admit it.

1126
01:05:10,134 --> 01:05:13,903
What is it about him that makes you
that you prefer him to your uncle?

1127
01:05:14,804 --> 01:05:16,869
He doesn't care about you.

1128
01:05:18,271 --> 01:05:21,277
He loves only himself
and his Bonheur des dames.

1129
01:05:23,722 --> 01:05:26,367
- It's been tough,
but I made it.

1130
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:28,211
My dream came true.

1131
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:30,575
Look at that, Bumblebee:

1132
01:05:30,776 --> 01:05:32,539
Europe's largest
in Europe.

1133
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:36,146
I want to inaugurate it
in a sensational way.

1134
01:05:36,347 --> 01:05:38,311
In January?
Why not?

1135
01:05:38,511 --> 01:05:41,076
After the New Year's gifts,
in the middle of the off-season?

1136
01:05:41,276 --> 01:05:43,801
I'm getting rid of the off-season.
Easy for you to say.

1137
01:05:43,982 --> 01:05:45,124
Easy to make.

1138
01:05:45,324 --> 01:05:47,809
It's all about attracting
customers.

1139
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:52,138
I want to make her want
to buy in all seasons.

1140
01:05:52,338 --> 01:05:54,903
What do you expect to find
when it snows?

1141
01:05:55,104 --> 01:05:56,787
Now that sounds
just right.

1142
01:05:56,987 --> 01:05:59,913
We're going to do
an exhibition of white.

1143
01:06:00,113 --> 01:06:03,762
"White?
Linen, lace...

1144
01:06:03,962 --> 01:06:06,807
I can see it now:
a symphony in white.

1145
01:06:06,988 --> 01:06:08,531
It will be unexpected.

1146
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:10,495
All Paris will crash here.

1147
01:06:10,695 --> 01:06:14,342
It'll be crowded.
Exactly.

1148
01:06:16,607 --> 01:06:18,591
Brouhaha.

1149
01:06:37,428 --> 01:06:39,391
From management,
madam.

1150
01:06:41,235 --> 01:06:43,399
From management.
No, I'm fine.

1151
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:55,704
Look at these handkerchiefs,
ma'am.

1152
01:06:55,885 --> 01:06:57,468
A real opportunity.

1153
01:06:57,668 --> 01:07:00,073
Don't you buy any?
No, not here.

1154
01:07:00,273 --> 01:07:01,877
It's a house
of thieves.

1155
01:07:05,123 --> 01:07:07,968
Two 16th century Chinese vases
at 350 F each.

1156
01:07:08,169 --> 01:07:11,095
700 francs.
Minus 600 francs return.

1157
01:07:11,295 --> 01:07:13,820
This means you only
100 francs to pay.

1158
01:07:14,902 --> 01:07:17,667
Do you have to have them delivered?
No.

1159
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:20,072
I want to surprise
surprise my husband.

1160
01:07:20,273 --> 01:07:23,519
Be careful with them.
They're fragile.

1161
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:27,126
Don't worry.
I won't take them back.

1162
01:07:27,326 --> 01:07:29,571
Au revoir, madame.
All the best.

1163
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:37,026
2 imitation China vases,
sold at 9.95 each.

1164
01:07:37,207 --> 01:07:39,752
- 19.90 for madame.

1165
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:42,477
Sold out.

1166
01:07:47,267 --> 01:07:48,048
Mr Mouret.

1167
01:07:48,248 --> 01:07:49,411
Summoned?
Yes.

1168
01:07:49,611 --> 01:07:51,535
Please wait.
The boss is busy.

1169
01:07:56,905 --> 01:08:00,593
Your white exhibition
is a real triumph.

1170
01:08:00,773 --> 01:08:02,476
You're a great man.

1171
01:08:02,677 --> 01:08:05,442
Besides,
I never doubted it.

1172
01:08:06,745 --> 01:08:07,687
What is it?

1173
01:08:07,867 --> 01:08:09,009
It's for the summer.

1174
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:12,015
I live 6 months ahead
ahead of customers.

1175
01:08:12,215 --> 01:08:16,063
This summer, women
show off their calves at the beach.

1176
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:23,799
It's indecent...
We wouldn't dare wear that.

1177
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:25,322
We'll see.

1178
01:08:25,503 --> 01:08:27,366
You're having dinner at my place.

1179
01:08:27,567 --> 01:08:29,731
A small gathering
in your honor.

1180
01:08:29,931 --> 01:08:33,097
That's a shame.
I dine with my staff.

1181
01:08:33,298 --> 01:08:35,502
At my place, there will be
Baron Haussmann

1182
01:08:35,703 --> 01:08:37,827
and the Duchess
de Maufrigneuse.

1183
01:08:38,027 --> 01:08:40,472
And here,
will be my employees.

1184
01:08:40,672 --> 01:08:45,121
You prefer the company of your
to that of my friends?

1185
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:48,247
We're not meant
to get along.

1186
01:08:48,448 --> 01:08:51,734
Let's part without bitterness,
shall we?

1187
01:08:51,914 --> 01:08:52,696
What did you say?

1188
01:08:53,698 --> 01:08:57,946
Our adventure could not last
longer than our deadlines.

1189
01:08:58,147 --> 01:09:00,672
But one remains,
the strongest.

1190
01:09:00,872 --> 01:09:03,637
I'll pay it in advance
with interest.

1191
01:09:03,838 --> 01:09:08,006
It was a good deal for you
and, I hope, not too unpleasant.

1192
01:09:08,206 --> 01:09:12,496
I'll always have fond memories of our
a fond memory.

1193
01:09:12,696 --> 01:09:14,820
You're very good,
Mr. Mouret.

1194
01:09:16,664 --> 01:09:19,910
A bit of a cad.
Sloppy education.

1195
01:09:20,111 --> 01:09:21,754
I'll send you
you a receipt.

1196
01:09:21,954 --> 01:09:24,760
please,
for accounting purposes.

1197
01:09:26,243 --> 01:09:27,886
Farewell.
Farewell.

1198
01:09:29,629 --> 01:09:30,731
Mademoiselle...

1199
01:09:38,146 --> 01:09:40,791
I want to tell you
a decision...

1200
01:09:41,873 --> 01:09:45,040
No need to go on.
I get it: you're firing me.

1201
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:48,727
When you stop pleasing,
you're thrown out into the street.

1202
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:52,574
You do everything for advertising,
nothing for the employees.

1203
01:09:52,775 --> 01:09:55,380
The saleswomen are fed
like dogs,

1204
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,186
watched like thieves.

1205
01:09:58,387 --> 01:10:00,591
"Customer sulks,
proceed to checkout."

1206
01:10:00,791 --> 01:10:03,316
"You're old,
check out."

1207
01:10:03,517 --> 01:10:05,521
"You're ugly,
check out."

1208
01:10:05,721 --> 01:10:09,008
"You're going to be a mother,
check out."

1209
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:11,733
"When you stood up
the boss,

1210
01:10:11,973 --> 01:10:14,578
"a Desforges whim,
please proceed to checkout."

1211
01:10:14,779 --> 01:10:17,184
Are you finished?
Yes.

1212
01:10:17,364 --> 01:10:18,867
Good.

1213
01:10:19,067 --> 01:10:22,113
I have summoned you
to tell you

1214
01:10:22,314 --> 01:10:26,602
that you return to confection
in first-class quality.

1215
01:10:28,666 --> 01:10:30,249
Thank you, sir.

1216
01:10:33,736 --> 01:10:36,501
A gentleman
is waiting for you in the tea room.

1217
01:10:36,702 --> 01:10:38,545
You mean me?
Yes, miss.

1218
01:10:42,273 --> 01:10:45,240
Madame...
By the way, Mr. Bourdoncle,

1219
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:49,087
I wonder why
you remain second to Mouret.

1220
01:10:49,288 --> 01:10:51,853
He's vulgar,
you're distinguished.

1221
01:10:52,053 --> 01:10:54,378
He's a primary,
you're cultured.

1222
01:10:54,578 --> 01:10:57,143
But come on,
you've got the makings of a chef.

1223
01:10:57,343 --> 01:11:01,271
What are you waiting for?
a store like this for the better?

1224
01:11:01,471 --> 01:11:04,437
Alas, dear lady,
I'm missing the essential.

1225
01:11:04,618 --> 01:11:06,561
Is it? Money.

1226
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:09,006
Come to my place tomorrow.
We'll work it out.

1227
01:11:09,187 --> 01:11:10,609
You can count on me, ma'am.

1228
01:11:17,383 --> 01:11:19,787
You promised me
not to come back.

1229
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:22,793
Take this and come quickly.

1230
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:29,647
I saw Uncle Baudu,
and I've come to kiss you.

1231
01:11:29,847 --> 01:11:31,772
I've got something
to tell you.

1232
01:11:31,952 --> 01:11:32,974
Then come quickly.

1233
01:11:43,355 --> 01:11:46,561
You look cheerful.
Bad news?

1234
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:50,208
Curious things are happening
in the basement.

1235
01:11:50,408 --> 01:11:51,611
Where?
Handling.

1236
01:11:51,811 --> 01:11:55,538
You should come down and have a look.
Interesting stuff.

1237
01:11:55,719 --> 01:11:56,701
What's up?

1238
01:11:56,901 --> 01:11:59,867
A young woman
who is dear to you

1239
01:12:00,047 --> 01:12:01,751
is not alone.

1240
01:12:04,997 --> 01:12:07,803
Signed: two people
who wish you well.

1241
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:10,408
Just listen.
It'll cost me 5 francs.

1242
01:12:10,608 --> 01:12:12,812
But I work.
I'm well paid.

1243
01:12:13,013 --> 01:12:15,177
I'm saving up
to get married.

1244
01:12:15,377 --> 01:12:16,860
Do you want to get married?
Yes.

1245
01:12:17,061 --> 01:12:18,705
But with whom?
A mystery.

1246
01:12:18,905 --> 01:12:21,350
Do I know her?
She's a colleague.

1247
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:24,596
She didn't tell me.
She doesn't know I'm your brother.

1248
01:12:24,797 --> 01:12:27,242
What did you invent?
Denise, remember.

1249
01:12:27,442 --> 01:12:30,248
You said you didn't
you didn't know me.

1250
01:12:41,029 --> 01:12:43,594
I'm so happy.
I'm happy too.

1251
01:12:43,774 --> 01:12:45,437
I'll come and see you tomorrow.

1252
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:48,443
Follow the corridor.

1253
01:12:48,624 --> 01:12:49,646
I love you.

1254
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:52,291
Goodbye.

1255
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:57,741
Not so fast.

1256
01:12:57,982 --> 01:13:00,146
No more
of you.

1257
01:13:00,347 --> 01:13:03,593
You deceived me, fooled me,
and I loved you.

1258
01:13:03,773 --> 01:13:05,718
I wanted to marry you.

1259
01:13:05,959 --> 01:13:07,722
Was he your lover?
"Lover?

1260
01:13:07,922 --> 01:13:10,928
You're not going to deny it.
I recognized him.

1261
01:13:11,129 --> 01:13:14,255
But...
A relative? Your brother, perhaps?

1262
01:13:14,475 --> 01:13:16,860
Give me a valid explanation.

1263
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:19,826
I'm not staying
another day.

1264
01:13:20,026 --> 01:13:22,110
"Not a day?
But not an hour.

1265
01:13:22,311 --> 01:13:23,954
Go back
from whence you came.

1266
01:13:24,134 --> 01:13:25,918
I'm hunting you!

1267
01:13:30,306 --> 01:13:31,328
- A little white?

1268
01:13:31,529 --> 01:13:33,653
No time.
I'm going to the party.

1269
01:13:33,853 --> 01:13:36,018
Ah, yes.
Is it true that we're going to dance?

1270
01:13:36,218 --> 01:13:38,302
I'm the one
who conducts the orchestra.

1271
01:13:38,482 --> 01:13:39,745
- A party?

1272
01:13:39,925 --> 01:13:41,669
That's all we needed.

1273
01:13:41,869 --> 01:13:45,356
He's no longer amused,
doing the wedding by himself?

1274
01:13:46,157 --> 01:13:50,245
It's going to be pretty.
A nice pinch.

1275
01:13:51,488 --> 01:13:54,254
I predicted
it would end up like this.

1276
01:13:54,435 --> 01:13:56,098
How about you?

1277
01:13:56,298 --> 01:13:58,944
I leave
Le Bonheur des dames.

1278
01:14:00,366 --> 01:14:01,829
Give me a kiss.

1279
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:05,196
With this news,
I'll be on my feet in no time.

1280
01:14:05,376 --> 01:14:06,438
Yes, Uncle.

1281
01:14:06,639 --> 01:14:09,284
Get well soon,
and let's leave for Valognes.

1282
01:14:09,464 --> 01:14:11,608
I'm going to pack.

1283
01:14:11,809 --> 01:14:15,296
Go quickly, my boy.
Go quickly.

1284
01:14:17,259 --> 01:14:19,985
"Lost and found: 2 bags,
1 muff, 3 umbrellas.

1285
01:14:20,185 --> 01:14:23,191
"Lost and found: 2 gloves,
a petticoat, 3 garters.

1286
01:14:23,391 --> 01:14:26,317
"Arrested: three thieves,
one professional,

1287
01:14:26,498 --> 01:14:28,642
"a fake inspector."

1288
01:14:28,822 --> 01:14:30,325
Nothing sensational.

1289
01:14:30,525 --> 01:14:32,610
On the other hand,
an appalling scandal:

1290
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:37,219
a saleswoman
kissed a customer.

1291
01:14:37,419 --> 01:14:39,704
She's here now.
She would like to justify herself.

1292
01:14:39,885 --> 01:14:41,107
Kick her out.

1293
01:14:41,308 --> 01:14:45,035
That's all for today.
Thank you for your time.

1294
01:14:45,215 --> 01:14:46,317
Here we are.

1295
01:14:48,422 --> 01:14:50,566
I can't believe my eyes.

1296
01:14:50,806 --> 01:14:53,091
I had to count
several times

1297
01:14:53,271 --> 01:14:55,255
to realize the obvious.

1298
01:14:55,455 --> 01:14:59,744
1 million 39,000 francs
65 centimes.

1299
01:14:59,944 --> 01:15:02,870
We've never seen that
in any store.

1300
01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:04,834
It's a date.

1301
01:15:09,082 --> 01:15:10,645
Here you are.
Thank you very much.

1302
01:15:34,373 --> 01:15:37,699
If Mr. Mouret knew,
he'd understand.

1303
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,383
Don't insist.

1304
01:15:41,006 --> 01:15:43,150
Here are 100,000 francs.

1305
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:45,314
You will give them
to Mr. Baudu.

1306
01:15:45,495 --> 01:15:46,396
Can I have a receipt?

1307
01:15:46,597 --> 01:15:49,001
Don't give him
explanation.

1308
01:15:49,542 --> 01:15:51,206
Don't send me away.

1309
01:15:51,406 --> 01:15:54,172
Did you make
all this scandal?

1310
01:15:54,372 --> 01:15:57,218
He's my fiancé.
That's no excuse.

1311
01:15:57,418 --> 01:16:01,586
I'm in the wrong,
but I was so happy...

1312
01:16:01,766 --> 01:16:05,033
He is Miss Baudu's brother.

1313
01:16:05,233 --> 01:16:07,918
His "brother"?
Yes.

1314
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:12,127
This is the young man
we saw in the corridor.

1315
01:16:12,327 --> 01:16:14,853
That was the day
I met him.

1316
01:16:15,494 --> 01:16:18,340
It's getting serious.
I take her to the checkout.

1317
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,827
Take her to the goldsmiths
to choose her gift.

1318
01:16:22,027 --> 01:16:25,274
Bring me Miss Baudu,
dead or alive.

1319
01:16:27,778 --> 01:16:28,760
Bumblebee!

1320
01:16:31,325 --> 01:16:33,249
Take this pad
and this pencil,

1321
01:16:34,091 --> 01:16:38,059
and write down the names of two people
who are referred.

1322
01:16:38,259 --> 01:16:41,826
Clara Prunaire,
dressmaking saleswoman.

1323
01:16:42,006 --> 01:16:43,710
Bourdoncle, Emile...

1324
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:45,593
What does this mean?

1325
01:16:45,794 --> 01:16:49,200
You're a couple of bastards.
I'm throwing you out.

1326
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:52,166
You're trying to set up
a competing company.

1327
01:16:52,347 --> 01:16:54,611
- Me, Monsieur Mouret?

1328
01:16:54,811 --> 01:16:56,855
I've got
have my own police force.

1329
01:16:57,056 --> 01:16:59,942
As a bonus, I give you
her lover, Colomban!

1330
01:17:00,122 --> 01:17:01,666
A great team!

1331
01:17:01,866 --> 01:17:04,351
Don't make me
to throw you out.

1332
01:17:04,552 --> 01:17:06,716
First
and final warning.

1333
01:17:08,579 --> 01:17:09,561
What can I do for you?

1334
01:17:09,762 --> 01:17:11,966
We can't
continue without you.

1335
01:17:12,146 --> 01:17:13,529
You're wanted.

1336
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:16,816
Without you, the party is incomplete.
We insist.

1337
01:17:17,016 --> 01:17:18,900
It's OK, it's OK.
Come on, I'll follow you.

1338
01:17:21,004 --> 01:17:22,988
Ballroom music.

1339
01:18:23,006 --> 01:18:25,151
Here's your 100,000 francs.

1340
01:18:25,672 --> 01:18:28,157
Baudu doesn't accept
charity.

1341
01:18:28,357 --> 01:18:31,162
You've ruined me,
thrown me out on the street.

1342
01:18:31,363 --> 01:18:33,768
But you won't triumph
for long.

1343
01:18:33,968 --> 01:18:36,093
You have created
a cruel machine

1344
01:18:36,273 --> 01:18:38,137
that will stop at nothing.

1345
01:18:38,338 --> 01:18:41,584
You too will meet
your Mouret,

1346
01:18:41,764 --> 01:18:43,668
a forban more powerful than you

1347
01:18:43,868 --> 01:18:46,874
who will crush you
as you have crushed others

1348
01:18:47,055 --> 01:18:49,239
and will be crushed in its turn.

1349
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:53,287
In 20 years, commerce
will be an ugly battle,

1350
01:18:53,487 --> 01:18:56,974
where quality, integrity
and trust

1351
01:18:57,174 --> 01:19:02,585
will be trampled underfoot, murdered,
like Old Elbeuf.

1352
01:19:02,765 --> 01:19:04,188
Take care, Mouret,

1353
01:19:04,389 --> 01:19:08,958
you establish the reign
of junk and glitz.

1354
01:19:09,138 --> 01:19:12,605
But patience pays off.

1355
01:19:12,805 --> 01:19:17,895
You too will one day experience
unemployment and poor sales.

1356
01:19:18,095 --> 01:19:20,460
You'll become
the slave of financiers,

1357
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,465
and your shoddy cathedrals

1358
01:19:22,665 --> 01:19:26,433
will collapse
in a chaos of ruins,

1359
01:19:26,613 --> 01:19:30,361
of scandal and blood.

1360
01:19:30,541 --> 01:19:32,084
I'm too old.

1361
01:19:32,284 --> 01:19:36,453
I'll be lucky to die
before I've seen it all.

1362
01:19:46,192 --> 01:19:50,360
Yes, my friends,
Mr. Baudu is right.

1363
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:55,490
My company could only be built
by ruining good people.

1364
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:57,854
That's the price of progress.

1365
01:19:58,055 --> 01:20:00,379
But success also imposes
duties.

1366
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:02,824
If unintentionally,
I have done harm,

1367
01:20:03,025 --> 01:20:04,988
I consciously want
do good.

1368
01:20:05,189 --> 01:20:07,914
It was my collaborators
I thought.

1369
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:09,879
Here is my program:

1370
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:12,685
reinstatement of employees
dismissed without cause.

1371
01:20:12,865 --> 01:20:15,731
Applause.

1372
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:18,055
Introduction of marriage loans.

1373
01:20:21,582 --> 01:20:26,512
And construction of a maternity hospital,
a hospice,

1374
01:20:26,712 --> 01:20:30,720
guaranteed retirement
for those who have toiled here.

1375
01:20:37,874 --> 01:20:40,780
Applause.

1376
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,944
Don't thank me.

1377
01:20:43,144 --> 01:20:47,272
I've been thinking about you
because one of you

1378
01:20:47,513 --> 01:20:50,519
made me understand
your misery and your hopes.

1379
01:20:51,901 --> 01:20:53,685
Thank Mlle Baudu,

1380
01:20:53,885 --> 01:20:56,170
who, I hope,
will soon be Mrs Mouret.

1381
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:58,255
What does this mean?

1382
01:20:58,455 --> 01:21:03,145
I have the honor
of asking for your hand in marriage.

1383
01:21:03,966 --> 01:21:05,950
Applause.

1384
01:21:23,525 --> 01:21:24,827
Watch out!

1385
01:21:26,891 --> 01:21:27,713
Ah!

1386
01:21:27,893 --> 01:21:29,476
- Oh! Oh!

1387
01:21:41,159 --> 01:21:43,585
Applause.

1388
01:21:43,785 --> 01:21:47,392
You are no longer my employees.
You're my partners.

1389
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:54,526
And Le Bonheur des dames
belongs to all of us.

1390
01:21:54,747 --> 01:21:56,731
Applause.

1391
