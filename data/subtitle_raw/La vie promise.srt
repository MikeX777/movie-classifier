For the night?

Not the friend, just you.

27
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:35,121
Get out of here.

28
00:02:35,927 --> 00:02:36,837
Get lost!

29
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:09,239
What a pain in the ass.

30
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:15,719
You were supposed to see me.

31
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:21,237
Shit, is it the 1 1th already?

00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:24,718

l'm not responsible for you.

36
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,965
What are you looking at?
What's your problem?

37
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:43,879
She's my daughter!

38
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:53,723
Go on, get out of here!

39
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:17,204
GHOST RlVER

40
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:49,123
You got everything here.
Quiet place to talk...

41
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:53,685
Give me a break, Charles.
l just got off work an hour ago.

42
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,800
There's a problem.

43
00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:58,958
What's the problem?

44
00:08:00,927 --> 00:08:02,599
Tell him, Charles.

45
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:06,522
l don't like causing problems.
l hate bullshit.

46
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:09,958
l just want to go to bed.

47
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:13,040
Know what the problem is?

48
00:08:13,207 --> 00:08:16,199
Give me a break
about the money.

49
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:18,722
l haven't touched it
for 5 years.

50
00:08:19,127 --> 00:08:21,118
Shit, chill out.

51
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,644
Can we make up? Let's have a drink.

52
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:28,842
What the fuck is this! Are you nuts?

53
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:31,085
l haven't got the money!

54
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:33,443
l bust my ass all day!

55
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:34,960
Don't touch me.

56
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:40,563
Stop!

57
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:41,876
Stupid bitch!

58
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:43,882
Watch it.

59
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:47,641
Where's the money?

60
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:51,477
Stop it!

61
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:54,721
Get up.

62
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,920
Who's she?
What the hell are you doing here?

63
00:08:58,087 --> 00:08:58,963
Get lost.

64
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,001
Get out, Laurence!

65
00:09:16,367 --> 00:09:20,076
What have you done, Laurence?
He's dead.

66
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:40,638
We've got to get out of here.

67
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:46,722
Why the hell are you here,
little shit?

68
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,560
Why the hell are you here!

69
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:51,444
Stupid shit!

70
00:09:57,607 --> 00:09:59,563
Let's go. Before he comes back.

71
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:04,320
Come on.

72
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,399
What's wrong, sweetheart?

73
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:17,922
My keys... l have to make a call.

74
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:20,282
- Use the kitchen phone.
- l'll be quick.

75
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:22,358
What's the rush?

76
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:48,320
Sandra, Sandra, please...

77
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:56,679
You won't believe it...
lt's me, Sylvia.

78
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:01,678
l'm sorry to call so late.

79
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,117
What's wrong?

80
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,278
l'm in deep shit, Sandra.

81
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:07,122
Hang on a minute.

82
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,797
- l'll change phones.
- l can't wait too long.

83
00:11:13,887 --> 00:11:15,081
Get on the sidewalk.

84
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:43,000
l'm late. l'm always running late.

85
00:12:51,607 --> 00:12:52,881
You could say hello.

86
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:56,119
l think l told you about her...
My little sister.

87
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:04,244
l have problems.
l had to get out of Nice quick.

88
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:08,595
Well...

89
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,518
lt'll blow over. lt's nothing.

90
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:18,925
l won't go into detail.
l just couldn't stay.

91
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:21,839
l have to wait a while.

92
00:13:31,487 --> 00:13:33,796
Get me some cigarettes, please.

93
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:38,518
You must think
''Always the same shit''.

94
00:13:38,927 --> 00:13:40,121
Sylvia...

95
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:42,720
Listen, l...

96
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,317
All that's over for me now.

97
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:50,967
My husband doesn't want
to know about my past.

98
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:57,320
What's going on?

99
00:13:57,487 --> 00:13:59,205
Nothing. lt just happened.

100
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:01,881
And with that kid in my hair...

101
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:04,880
l don't know what to do.

102
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,280
lt could be worse.

103
00:14:11,847 --> 00:14:13,200
Are you sure?

104
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:18,604
l can't put you up at my place.

105
00:14:22,087 --> 00:14:23,645
No, don't worry.

106
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:25,844
l thought l'd go North.

107
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,478
l have family up there.

108
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:37,519
Or maybe the mountains.
l don't know. l'll find a place.

109
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:48,124
Could you put some music on?

110
00:14:57,327 --> 00:14:58,680
Piotr sent me a letter.

111
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:02,166
A while back. 2 or 3 years ago.

112
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:04,445
He asked about you.

113
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,523
l can't Sandra.

114
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,318
l've put that behind me, too.

115
00:15:12,527 --> 00:15:14,483
l don't know. Maybe l'm wrong.

116
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:18,318
You can't go back.

117
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:21,804
He wondered if you'd called,

118
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:23,958
where you'd disappeared to.

119
00:15:24,487 --> 00:15:26,443
He was worried about you.

120
00:15:26,607 --> 00:15:28,040
He's a good guy.

121
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:34,483
l don't know. l can't explain it.

122
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:43,163
He didn't try hard to find me.

123
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:44,760
Don't be silly.

124
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:47,239
You left.

125
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:49,205
Why did you go back to Nice?

126
00:15:51,527 --> 00:15:52,960
You should go see him.

127
00:15:53,847 --> 00:15:55,041
Find Piotr.

128
00:15:56,847 --> 00:15:58,838
He lives in the same place,
l'm sure.

129
00:15:59,847 --> 00:16:03,556
You'll see your kid.
He's grown up now. He must be...

130
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:06,039
8 or something?

131
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:11,965
lt was so long ago.

132
00:16:12,207 --> 00:16:13,925
l've forgotten everything.

133
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:20,680
l just remember a sawmill
by a river bank.

134
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,398
l don't have an address...

135
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:28,686
My memory's...

136
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:35,157
My in-laws won't be here
till tomorrow.

137
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:37,525
You can stay the night.

138
00:16:39,087 --> 00:16:40,486
You need rest.

139
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,686
You shouldn't do that.

140
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:09,284
lt suddenly bothers you?

141
00:17:09,447 --> 00:17:11,597
Think l love it here?

142
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:12,756
l said it for you.

143
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:15,122
Why did you get mixed up in my life?

144
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:18,802
Just get lost. l don't need you,
you don't need me.

145
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:21,686
- Go wherever...
- You really want me to go?

146
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,606
ls that what you want?

147
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,366
l'm out of here.

148
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:27,726
Stay!

149
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:35,239
lt's a bit late for that.

150
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:54,286
Why not take the train?

151
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:56,119
We need to keep a low profile.

152
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,285
l have no choice.

153
00:18:03,527 --> 00:18:04,880
Here are the letters.

154
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:10,558
Go see Piotr. Find him.

155
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:18,436
l'm not from around here.
Where are we?

156
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:21,075
The timetables change a lot.

157
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:22,996
Can l clear this off?

158
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:28,165
You have a bus over there.

159
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:31,200
The stop is that way.
Go right...

160
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:34,519
- You OK? You don't seem well.
- lt's nothing.

161
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:43,999
Stop, Laurence.

162
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:48,159
Stop. Do you want everyone
to notice us?

163
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,444
Shit. l'm not mother Theresa here.

164
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:54,246
Calm down.

165
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:57,601
lf the cops pick us up,
it won't be my problem.

166
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:58,836
Calm down.

167
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:01,960
Calm yourself. Look at me.

168
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:42,767
lt's my birthday.

169
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:46,560
Three presents.

170
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,842
l can't do it.

171
00:19:48,007 --> 00:19:50,282
Can you help me, Daddy?

172
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:52,600
Can you help me?

173
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:11,844
lt's hot today.

174
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:18,036
Car broke down. We're going North.
We want to take a bus.

175
00:20:18,727 --> 00:20:21,400
You should have your car repaired.

176
00:20:21,727 --> 00:20:23,365
We're on vacation.

177
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:25,325
Where are you going?

178
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:28,245
Near Viale.

179
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,237
Her parents
are expecting her tonight.

180
00:20:33,087 --> 00:20:34,440
Near Viale?

181
00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:38,406
Somewhere around there.
l don't remember exactly.

182
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,196
lt'll be tough finding her parents.

183
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:44,406
We're supposed to meet.

184
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:47,161
l stupidly left the address
in the car.

185
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:50,006
We have to find her father.

186
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:54,797
Why am l always justifying myself?

187
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:56,798
Where's the bus?

188
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:04,445
Why that story about my father?

189
00:21:04,607 --> 00:21:06,245
l don't like questions.

190
00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:08,086
Who is this guy?

191
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:10,126
How many lives have you had?

192
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:15,480
Did you care when l was sent
to foster homes?

193
00:21:18,007 --> 00:21:20,123
How many kids have you had?

194
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:29,800
Where are we going now?

195
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:31,480
l know as little as you.

196
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:33,525
You don't have his address.

197
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:37,806
He's in a village. l don't have
to tell you my life story!

198
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:47,517
You should look at the stars.

199
00:21:55,327 --> 00:21:57,716
They say at birth, you can tell

200
00:21:57,887 --> 00:22:00,162
if you were born under a lucky star.

201
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:08,479
You want to know something?

202
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:13,319
Don't answer so quick.

203
00:22:15,847 --> 00:22:19,920
When you were born, it was
a starry night. lt was beautiful.

204
00:22:22,487 --> 00:22:23,715
No.

205
00:22:24,287 --> 00:22:26,118
l'm making it up. lt's bullshit.

206
00:22:26,287 --> 00:22:28,642
Your father and l had a quick screw.

207
00:22:29,407 --> 00:22:31,284
Then l never saw him again.

208
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:40,325
With Piotr it was different.
He understood me.

209
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,845
He was patient.

210
00:22:45,047 --> 00:22:46,241
Stop it.

211
00:22:47,487 --> 00:22:49,398
You just want to make me cry.

212
00:22:51,927 --> 00:22:53,963
You're the worst person l know.

213
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:56,366
What are you doing here?

214
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:59,485
Nothing. l'm out of here!

215
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:27,795
Sylvia,

216
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,482
l'm writing this letter tonight

217
00:23:30,647 --> 00:23:33,605
wondering again
if l made the right decision.

218
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:37,639
l wanted to respect your silence,
but l miss you too much.

219
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:40,685
We miss you terribly,
except for mother.

220
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:42,121
But you know how she is.

221
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:45,556
At the sawmill, l stop sometimes

222
00:23:45,727 --> 00:23:48,116
and watch for you
at the end of the road.

223
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:52,965
Everyday l hope the mailman will
bring news of you... an explanation.

224
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:57,043
What happened? Things were good,
at least l thought so.

225
00:24:01,847 --> 00:24:04,361
l remember the day
you picked up Yannis

226
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:07,246
and told me you'd be a good mother.

227
00:24:07,407 --> 00:24:09,967
There was a twinkle in your eyes.

228
00:24:10,127 --> 00:24:13,244
l thought your dark times
were behind you.

229
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:17,397
You know me, l'm not judging you.

230
00:24:17,567 --> 00:24:18,886
l'm waiting for a sign.

231
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:34,038
There's no CB radio in this car.
lt's my own car.

232
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:35,686
l have a cell phone if you want.

233
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:38,042
The mechanic said an axle rod went,

234
00:25:38,207 --> 00:25:40,801
something like that...
nothing can be done.

235
00:25:41,127 --> 00:25:42,526
Call him anyway.

236
00:25:42,687 --> 00:25:44,678
- Who?
- Your husband.

237
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:48,039
lt's his car, right?

238
00:25:51,047 --> 00:25:53,436
Yes... My husband
knows all about it.

239
00:25:56,607 --> 00:25:57,676
What does he do?

240
00:25:59,287 --> 00:26:00,515
Excuse me?

241
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:03,159
What does your husband do?

242
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:06,644
Actually, my husband's dead.

243
00:26:08,487 --> 00:26:09,840
Really...

244
00:26:10,287 --> 00:26:11,561
Sorry... l am...

245
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:13,240
lt's no big deal.

246
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:17,001
l'm so sorry... that's life.
l'm just babbling.

247
00:26:17,927 --> 00:26:19,326
Sorry.

248
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:24,641
- What do you do?
- l'm a cop.

249
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:28,325
My wife says
we never go on vacation so...

250
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:29,715
l don't work anymore.

251
00:26:30,527 --> 00:26:33,883
l worked for a long time
selling perfume.

252
00:26:37,807 --> 00:26:39,604
- Are you OK, honey?
- Yes.

253
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:41,962
You're so good.
You're never like this.

254
00:26:42,127 --> 00:26:44,800
She's showing off for the lady.

255
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,399
We should keep her with us.

256
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:33,960
What are you doing?

257
00:27:34,607 --> 00:27:35,960
ls it yours?

258
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:39,802
l have the same car. l was confused.
l forgot where l parked.

259
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:47,677
- Get out!
- lt's raining.

260
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:51,960
That guy's a cop. l'm not bothered,
but his brat kept bawling.

261
00:27:52,127 --> 00:27:54,766
- Get out!
- l lied. l don't have a car.

262
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:00,206
Please.

263
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:02,116
Where are you going?

264
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,119
As far as possible.

265
00:28:04,807 --> 00:28:06,923
l'll drop you off
when it stops raining.

266
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:16,520
Asshole!

267
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:22,440
My bag!

268
00:28:23,807 --> 00:28:26,196
l can't believe this. Shit!

269
00:28:37,807 --> 00:28:39,160
Please...

270
00:28:39,327 --> 00:28:41,716
Hello. Can l come with you?

271
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:11,759
Then l got married.

272
00:29:12,007 --> 00:29:15,761
l married a guy named Piotr.

273
00:29:16,647 --> 00:29:18,444
And then... shit!

274
00:29:24,407 --> 00:29:26,398
Piotr saved my life.

275
00:29:34,927 --> 00:29:38,158
He saved my life, and then...

276
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:17,436
Laurence!

277
00:33:07,807 --> 00:33:10,480
Eric? What are you doing?

278
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:12,200
What time is it?

279
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:14,324
Yeah... What time are you coming?

280
00:33:14,487 --> 00:33:15,681
Excuse me.

281
00:33:15,847 --> 00:33:18,315
What time
did l ask you to leave today?

282
00:33:18,807 --> 00:33:22,516
Room 1 1 2 hasn't been done.
Let's not even talk about 1 1 3.

283
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:24,559
See you soon. Bye.

284
00:33:25,127 --> 00:33:26,196
What do you want?

285
00:33:26,367 --> 00:33:28,597
l'm looking for my daughter.

286
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:32,204
She's disappeared. She's 1 4.
Her name's Laurence.

287
00:33:32,607 --> 00:33:34,757
- Have you seen her?
- l haven't seen her.

288
00:33:34,927 --> 00:33:35,962
Sorry.

289
00:33:39,127 --> 00:33:41,004
- Thanks.
- No problem.

290
00:34:05,047 --> 00:34:06,924
Where did that woman go?

291
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,486
What woman?

292
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:50,443
l want to be the most beautiful
woman in the world.

293
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:52,643
What does it take?

294
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:55,879
Good posture, nice smile,
loving your children...

295
00:34:57,047 --> 00:34:59,607
Nobody showed me the ropes.
l need to learn.

296
00:35:00,647 --> 00:35:02,319
l'll learn how to be
the most beautiful woman...

297
00:35:02,487 --> 00:35:03,636
Sylvia,

298
00:35:04,207 --> 00:35:06,767
Sandra has no idea where you are.

299
00:35:09,887 --> 00:35:12,162
l'm writing a new letter
because l know

300
00:35:12,327 --> 00:35:14,761
you'll contact her sooner or later.

301
00:35:16,847 --> 00:35:19,361
l just want you to come home to us.

302
00:35:27,247 --> 00:35:30,922
l saw the doctors at the hospital.
l needed an explanation.

303
00:35:33,727 --> 00:35:35,604
Don't worry, Mommy.

304
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:39,356
Sylvia,

305
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:43,397
l know how fragile you are
and l imagine the worst.

306
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:47,279
l must have done something wrong.

307
00:35:51,727 --> 00:35:53,718
Maybe you needed more time.

308
00:35:54,407 --> 00:35:56,967
l tried to heal you too quickly.

309
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:52,316
Alright, call you later. Bye.

310
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:55,360
Hey, excuse me.

311
00:36:55,607 --> 00:36:57,837
Where are you going?

312
00:36:58,327 --> 00:36:59,840
Hey, l'm talking to you.

313
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:04,885
You're one of those cool babes
with your green birdshit jacket.

314
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:06,400
You look like a bum.

315
00:37:07,287 --> 00:37:08,766
Get out of here!

316
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:12,759
You're jumpy.
Don't run away like that.

317
00:37:12,927 --> 00:37:15,919
- Look how she's dressed.
- You're a wild one.

318
00:37:16,847 --> 00:37:18,200
Look at this one.

319
00:37:18,607 --> 00:37:20,643
- Who's the bum?
- Stay with us, we don't bite.

320
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:23,480
- Your friend's jumpy.
- She's tense.

321
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:27,277
Nice clothes.
Are they Salvation Army?

322
00:37:27,447 --> 00:37:30,007
- Come back here.
- Where are you going?

323
00:37:39,327 --> 00:37:40,555
You OK?

324
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:42,640
Why did you do that?

325
00:37:43,047 --> 00:37:44,765
l just wanted to help you.

326
00:37:44,927 --> 00:37:46,645
l can handle it.

327
00:37:48,847 --> 00:37:50,565
l should leave.

328
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,080
Whatever you want.

329
00:37:52,327 --> 00:37:54,158
Sorry about the handkerchief.

330
00:37:59,367 --> 00:38:01,085
Where did you get this bag?

331
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:03,558
Someone forgot it.

332
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:07,478
lt's my mother's.
We lost each other.

333
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,317
Flowers are marvelous things.

334
00:38:17,567 --> 00:38:19,398
l've forgotten all the varieties,

335
00:38:20,727 --> 00:38:22,797
forgotten all l knew about them.

336
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:27,565
My grandmother's garden
seems so far.

337
00:38:28,527 --> 00:38:30,438
One morning,
it was covered in snow.

338
00:38:31,327 --> 00:38:33,795
A few inches thick on the wall.

339
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:37,997
l thought the flowers would die

340
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:39,522
and l cried.

341
00:39:44,207 --> 00:39:46,357
My mom and l
were going to the mountains.

342
00:39:48,927 --> 00:39:50,599
Did you have an argument?

343
00:39:53,247 --> 00:39:55,522
To argue,
you have to know one another.

344
00:39:57,287 --> 00:39:58,766
We don't know each other.

345
00:40:02,527 --> 00:40:05,883
She's got problems.
She doesn't remember anything.

346
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:11,239
The town is called Viale.

347
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:13,964
Near a river, l think.

348
00:40:15,607 --> 00:40:17,279
That's all l know.

349
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:29,043
My husband found you in his field.
You passed out.

350
00:40:29,647 --> 00:40:31,683
No need for a doctor. l was a nurse.

351
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:35,478
Do you want to eat something?

352
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:38,206
Rest now.

353
00:40:39,287 --> 00:40:41,039
lf you'd like to change...

354
00:41:25,887 --> 00:41:27,718
- How old are you?
- Six.

355
00:41:28,767 --> 00:41:30,678
Did you ever play airplane?

356
00:41:36,847 --> 00:41:38,246
Quick! Open your mouth.

357
00:41:44,647 --> 00:41:47,844
Need to phone?
Maybe the girl told your family.

358
00:41:48,007 --> 00:41:49,360
l have no family.

359
00:41:53,327 --> 00:41:55,682
l was very little
when my parents left.

360
00:41:56,327 --> 00:41:59,558
My grandmother took me in.
She died when l was eight.

361
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:30,959
''The Minister of Justice hereby
confirms that Mr. Joshua Ferrer

362
00:42:31,127 --> 00:42:34,722
...presently incarcerated
under the number...''

363
00:42:50,287 --> 00:42:52,357
We're leaving. Hurry up.

364
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:02,483
l got into it by accident.

365
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:05,207
l stole one car, then another.

366
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:09,517
What do you want to do
for a living?

367
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,086
l don't know.

368
00:43:16,647 --> 00:43:17,966
ls Joshua your real name?

369
00:43:18,127 --> 00:43:18,764
Yes.

370
00:43:19,887 --> 00:43:21,036
Where does it come from?

371
00:43:21,207 --> 00:43:22,481
Far away.

372
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:33,120
Have you been in prison?

373
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:38,199
l found your papers.

374
00:43:40,887 --> 00:43:42,764
l looked through your bag.

375
00:43:47,487 --> 00:43:49,876
l did my time almost to the end.

376
00:44:00,567 --> 00:44:02,797
You should go see your kid.

377
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:07,798
He's grown up. He must be
around eight years old now.

378
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:12,405
Blue Centaury means
''l'll love you forever''.

379
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:16,640
Yellow Jasmine means
''l want to be everything for you''.

380
00:44:16,807 --> 00:44:17,762
Mommy...

381
00:44:17,967 --> 00:44:20,037
l'm over the rainbow,
just like in the song.

382
00:44:20,207 --> 00:44:21,276
Mommy, l'm thirsty.

383
00:44:21,447 --> 00:44:22,926
l'm looking for the wizard.

384
00:44:23,887 --> 00:44:25,559
Want me to sing you a lullaby?

385
00:44:59,607 --> 00:45:01,086
''Thanks for everything. Sylvia''

386
00:45:02,647 --> 00:45:05,878
Someone may have seen her
in the gas station.

387
00:45:06,807 --> 00:45:09,526
She makes a scene
wherever she goes.

388
00:45:12,647 --> 00:45:13,397
Shit!

389
00:45:21,007 --> 00:45:24,920
Hello. Police.
May l see your papers please?

390
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,880
That's your daughter?

391
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:42,358
Dad's taking me fishing.

392
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:44,479
We're picking up my wife.

393
00:45:45,567 --> 00:45:47,637
Thank you. Have a good day.

394
00:46:09,527 --> 00:46:11,165
Thanks for earlier.

395
00:46:11,327 --> 00:46:12,806
Thanks for what?

396
00:46:14,407 --> 00:46:15,726
For the cops.

397
00:46:18,087 --> 00:46:20,078
A few days ago, l hurt someone.

398
00:46:21,887 --> 00:46:23,525
He may be dead.

399
00:46:32,327 --> 00:46:35,444
Sorry, there's no Piotr Chimsky
in Viale.

400
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:38,317
There used to be a sawmill nearby.

401
00:46:38,967 --> 00:46:40,685
Maybe he's not there anymore.

402
00:46:41,247 --> 00:46:43,283
l have to meet up with him.

403
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:47,559
There's no other way?

404
00:46:49,527 --> 00:46:52,121
l can look in towns in the area...

405
00:46:52,287 --> 00:46:55,324
Or otherwise we can check
the regions nearby.

406
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:58,638
No, l don't have
the strength to go on.

407
00:47:02,607 --> 00:47:04,120
Are you alright?

408
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:06,717
l can't go on.

409
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:13,166
- A ticket for Nice, please.
- Round trip?

410
00:47:13,327 --> 00:47:15,477
No, one way, please.

411
00:47:55,687 --> 00:47:57,166
Have you seen her?

412
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,437
Excuse me, have you seen this woman?

413
00:48:08,407 --> 00:48:09,635
Have you seen her?

414
00:48:11,807 --> 00:48:13,320
Do you know this woman?

415
00:48:16,527 --> 00:48:18,483
Does this face look familiar?

416
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:34,046
No one's seen her.

417
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:38,526
What's the matter?

418
00:48:39,687 --> 00:48:42,838
Does it happen a lot?
Don't you have pills? Anything?

419
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:46,079
Breathe deeply!

420
00:48:46,687 --> 00:48:49,804
Listen, l'm not a doctor.
l can't take care of you.

421
00:48:50,847 --> 00:48:52,644
Don't leave me alone.

422
00:49:16,327 --> 00:49:18,363
We need to find your mother fast.

423
00:49:19,567 --> 00:49:21,319
l can't hang around here.

424
00:49:25,607 --> 00:49:27,279
You have to sleep.

425
00:49:53,927 --> 00:49:56,646
Georges Clemenceau
Psychiatric Hospital.

426
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:47,037
Sylvia!

427
00:50:53,727 --> 00:50:55,206
Sylvia?

428
00:50:57,447 --> 00:50:59,324
You don't remember me.

429
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,485
You were at this hospital
for a while.

430
00:51:08,487 --> 00:51:10,637
You'd just had a little boy...

431
00:51:17,447 --> 00:51:19,165
l remember you.

432
00:51:25,687 --> 00:51:27,564
How's your little boy?

433
00:51:28,447 --> 00:51:32,042
He must be a big boy now.
Eight years old.

434
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:44,403
Normally l'm not allowed to do this.

435
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:47,558
lt's your entire file.

436
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:49,875
lt is your life.

437
00:51:50,047 --> 00:51:53,483
lt's yours now.
l hope it will help you.

438
00:53:21,047 --> 00:53:23,481
- Let go.
- Give me back the teddy bear!

439
00:53:23,647 --> 00:53:25,319
l'm going to pay for it! Let me go!

440
00:53:25,487 --> 00:53:27,796
- Give it back now!
- Don't touch me!

441
00:53:28,327 --> 00:53:30,602
- Thief!
- Let go of me!

442
00:53:30,767 --> 00:53:32,166
Let go of her!

443
00:53:32,327 --> 00:53:33,680
Let go of her!

444
00:54:07,527 --> 00:54:09,518
- What are you doing?
- You know this guy?

445
00:54:09,687 --> 00:54:12,918
He threw me out of his car
like a bum.

446
00:54:15,767 --> 00:54:18,042
Don't start! He helped me.

447
00:54:18,327 --> 00:54:22,366
Don't mess up my life. l found
Piotr's address. lt's not far.

448
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:24,638
Let's go. lt's best for everyone.

449
00:54:24,807 --> 00:54:26,206
l'm not coming.

450
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:50,162
l searched for you for three days.

451
00:54:57,007 --> 00:55:00,204
l was afraid l wouldn't find you.
l missed you.

452
00:56:01,527 --> 00:56:03,802
We'll come to a small town:
St. Louis.

453
00:56:08,367 --> 00:56:09,720
l'll recognize it.

454
00:56:45,727 --> 00:56:48,560
After 30 lessons,
l still don't have a license.

455
00:56:48,927 --> 00:56:52,044
First time,
my tire burst on the curb parking.

456
00:56:52,207 --> 00:56:53,003
lt was dramatic.

457
00:56:53,967 --> 00:56:55,685
Second time,
l jumped a stop sign.

458
00:56:58,567 --> 00:56:59,636
What a pretty route.

459
00:57:02,287 --> 00:57:03,197
l used you.

460
00:57:05,567 --> 00:57:07,319
lt's dangerous to stay with me.

461
00:57:08,087 --> 00:57:11,045
l'll drop you at the station.
Give you money. You'll get by.

462
00:57:11,687 --> 00:57:12,802
Watch out!

463
00:57:17,247 --> 00:57:18,839
Let me do it.

464
00:57:21,047 --> 00:57:24,756
That was funny with the flowers.
When l was a kid,

465
00:57:24,927 --> 00:57:26,838
l wanted to work with flowers.

466
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,563
l learned about cuttings
from grandma.

467
00:57:30,407 --> 00:57:31,840
l read about flowers.

468
00:57:32,967 --> 00:57:34,844
l really had a knack for it.

469
00:57:35,887 --> 00:57:37,957
l would've been a good florist.

470
00:57:39,447 --> 00:57:41,517
You never told me
about your grandmother.

471
00:57:45,847 --> 00:57:47,678
You lived in the country?

472
00:57:48,167 --> 00:57:49,282
Yes.

473
00:57:51,327 --> 00:57:52,760
With your parents?

474
00:57:54,447 --> 00:57:55,641
l don't know them.

475
00:57:56,127 --> 00:57:58,277
They left when l was little.

476
00:58:07,287 --> 00:58:09,084
l read Piotr's letters.

477
00:58:12,047 --> 00:58:14,038
l found them in your bag.

478
00:58:29,007 --> 00:58:30,599
l've got to disappear.

479
00:58:43,047 --> 00:58:44,526
Go see Thomas.

480
00:58:46,007 --> 00:58:47,076
Congratulate him for me.

481
00:58:48,087 --> 00:58:49,839
Tell him l'm thinking of him.

482
00:58:52,047 --> 00:58:55,357
Tell him to take care of his sister.

483
00:58:58,327 --> 00:58:59,396
Thanks.

484
00:59:21,247 --> 00:59:23,477
Where does this river flow?

485
00:59:30,127 --> 00:59:33,199
l can't stop thinking about
my grandma lately.

486
00:59:38,327 --> 00:59:40,124
We had a garden full of flowers.

487
00:59:45,727 --> 00:59:46,921
You'll catch cold.

488
00:59:49,087 --> 00:59:50,725
Do you have children?

489
00:59:54,847 --> 00:59:56,326
l did.

490
00:59:58,047 --> 00:59:59,958
We don't have to talk.

491
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:02,559
We can just stay like this.

492
01:00:10,567 --> 01:00:12,398
l'm a bad mother, right?

493
01:00:14,407 --> 01:00:16,284
You do the best you can.

494
01:00:18,087 --> 01:00:19,440
l'm ashamed.

495
01:00:20,887 --> 01:00:22,605
l want to be normal.

496
01:00:28,247 --> 01:00:30,602
- Time to go.
- No.

497
01:00:35,447 --> 01:00:36,926
Stay with me.

498
01:00:39,447 --> 01:00:41,039
A little while...

499
01:00:43,367 --> 01:00:44,846
Dance with me.

500
01:00:48,847 --> 01:00:51,407
- l don't know how to dance.
- Me neither.

501
01:01:15,887 --> 01:01:18,481
Grandma used to say
a person's treasure

502
01:01:18,647 --> 01:01:21,241
was in the flow of the ghost river.

503
01:01:22,527 --> 01:01:24,836
l asked her what this river was,

504
01:01:25,527 --> 01:01:28,758
and she replied,
''What you are now, my girl.

505
01:01:29,647 --> 01:01:32,161
''Everything you'll forget
when you grow up.

506
01:01:33,767 --> 01:01:36,679
''But it's something
you'll never stop being. ''

507
01:02:04,047 --> 01:02:05,878
What did you do
with the other one?

508
01:02:07,687 --> 01:02:09,040
Someone else is handling it.

509
01:02:09,207 --> 01:02:10,925
You're not going to Hamburg?

510
01:02:11,807 --> 01:02:13,798
A little change in the agenda.

511
01:02:13,967 --> 01:02:15,480
- l'll go later.
- When?

512
01:02:16,807 --> 01:02:18,240
Get in.

513
01:02:58,567 --> 01:02:59,795
Sylvia!

514
01:03:04,007 --> 01:03:05,440
ls it you?

515
01:03:06,967 --> 01:03:08,400
Marie-Josée.

516
01:03:11,527 --> 01:03:14,121
My daughter and l
were your neighbors.

517
01:03:17,087 --> 01:03:18,600
Marie-Josée...

518
01:03:20,487 --> 01:03:24,400
Sylvia taught my daughter
how to make a lemon pie.

519
01:03:32,207 --> 01:03:35,756
l ran into your mother-in-law
just a week ago.

520
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:38,444
They still have plenty of work.

521
01:03:38,647 --> 01:03:40,444
She was with your...

522
01:03:43,447 --> 01:03:44,641
Well...

523
01:03:45,367 --> 01:03:47,164
l'll get on with my shopping.

524
01:03:49,047 --> 01:03:50,639
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

525
01:04:05,927 --> 01:04:07,645
l know these places.

526
01:04:09,087 --> 01:04:10,964
l pushed them out of my mind.

527
01:04:12,927 --> 01:04:15,646
l found my memory in a medical file.

528
01:04:17,207 --> 01:04:19,118
Written on just a few pages,

529
01:04:20,647 --> 01:04:22,717
some names, some addresses,

530
01:04:25,247 --> 01:04:26,999
images that come back to me.

531
01:04:28,727 --> 01:04:31,480
l thought l'd lost my memory,
but l forgot nothing.

532
01:06:03,767 --> 01:06:05,405
This is the house.

533
01:09:09,127 --> 01:09:10,480
This is it.

534
01:09:12,567 --> 01:09:16,196
First time l came here
was after my marriage to Piotr.

535
01:09:19,527 --> 01:09:22,200
The second time,
l was 8 1/2 months pregnant.

536
01:09:50,367 --> 01:09:50,924
Sylvia?

537
01:10:08,847 --> 01:10:10,246
What are you doing here?

538
01:10:13,687 --> 01:10:15,405
The house burned down?

539
01:10:15,647 --> 01:10:17,763
More than three years ago.

540
01:10:21,207 --> 01:10:24,404
My dear, things have changed
