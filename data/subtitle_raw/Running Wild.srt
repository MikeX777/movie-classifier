WHEN WE FIRST SAW HER,

181
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:19,444
SHE WAS ELUSIVE, AGGRESSIVE,
AND VERY DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW,

182
00:13:19,444 --> 00:13:25,201
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER
WILD LEOPARD.

183
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:26,827
THEN GRADUALLY, SHE RELAXED,

184
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:30,705
ALLOWING US
INTO HER PRIVATE WORLD.

185
00:13:30,705 --> 00:13:32,457
SHE’S A VERY SUCCESSFUL MOTHER,

186
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:35,920
AND HAS ALLOWED US TO FILM
NO LESS THAN NINE

187
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,046
OF HER LITTERS OF CUBS.

188
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:40,091
NO OTHER HUMAN BEING HAS HAD
SUCH A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP

189
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:42,093
WITH A WILD LEOPARD BEFORE.

190
00:13:42,093 --> 00:13:46,138
WELL, THIS IS HER MOVING ONE OF
THE FIFTH LITTER TO ANOTHER DEN,

191
00:13:46,138 --> 00:13:47,722
WHICH SHE DOES EVERY FEW DAYS

192
00:13:47,722 --> 00:13:50,392
TO LESSEN THE CHANCES
OF LION AND HYENA

193
00:13:50,392 --> 00:13:52,144
FINDING AND KILLING THEM.

194
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:54,437
WELL, HERE YOU SEE
SARCOPTIC MANGE,

195
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:56,356
WHICH LEOPARDS
SOMETIMES CONTRACT.

196
00:13:56,356 --> 00:14:00,278
IT’S TINY PARASITE WHICH ATTACKS
THE SKIN AND THE FUR

197
00:14:00,278 --> 00:14:02,487
AND MOST OFTEN RESULTS IN DEATH.

198
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:04,866
ALL PREDATORS ARE COMPETING
FOR FOOD AND SPACE

199
00:14:04,866 --> 00:14:08,451
AND WILL IMMEDIATELY KILL
THE CUBS OF ANOTHER PREDATOR

200
00:14:08,451 --> 00:14:09,703
IF THEY FIND THEM.

201
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:12,455
THIS IS THE SADDEST MOMENT
WE EVER SHARED WITH HER.

202
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:15,792
SHE ATTACKED THE LIONS,
SAVED THE ONE CUB,

203
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:17,836
BUT THE OTHER WAS KILLED.

204
00:14:17,836 --> 00:14:19,213
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.

205
00:14:19,213 --> 00:14:21,381
SHE ATE PARTS OF THE DEAD CUB

206
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:26,053
AND THEN BURIED THE REST
IN THE BRUSH.

207
00:14:27,512 --> 00:14:30,308
EVEN THOUGH WE’D BEEN PART
OF EVERY ASPECT OF HER LIFE,

208
00:14:30,308 --> 00:14:35,271
IT WAS SEVEN YEARS BEFORE
WE’RE ABLE TO FILM HER MATING.

209
00:14:35,271 --> 00:14:40,609
WE’VE REALLY SHARED HER LIFE
IN MANY WAYS.

210
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:42,069
WE’VE SLEPT OUT
AT KILLS WITH HER.

211
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:45,990
WE’VE WATCHED HER CUBS GROW UP
AND HAVE CUBS OF THEIR OWN.

212
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:51,329
AND FOR ALL OF US, IT’S BEEN
A GREAT SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE,

213
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:52,746
ALMOST LIKE A LOVE AFFAIR,

214
00:14:52,746 --> 00:14:55,333
JUST TO BE PART OF HER LIFE.

215
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,793
- SHE WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
ANIMAL I HAD EVER SEEN.

216
00:14:58,793 --> 00:15:01,463
I UNDERSTOOD WHY JOHN AND ELMON
WERE SO DEDICATED TO HER.

217
00:15:01,463 --> 00:15:04,050
THE MORE I LEARNED
ABOUT HER LIFE,

218
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,051
THE CLEARER IT BECAME TO ME

219
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:08,095
THAT IT WAS HER STORY
THAT HAD TO BE TOLD.

220
00:15:08,095 --> 00:15:08,930
NOW IT WAS JUST A MATTER

221
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,474
OF GETTING THE GREEN LIGHT
FROM DAN.

222
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:19,899
- HI, CHRISTINE.
- HI, PAM.

223
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:20,857
- HOW WAS YOUR TRIP?

224
00:15:20,857 --> 00:15:22,776
- IT WAS GREAT.
DID ANYTHING COME IN FOR ME?

225
00:15:22,776 --> 00:15:25,779
- THIS JUST CAME.
- OH, GREAT.

226
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:26,864
HI.

227
00:15:26,864 --> 00:15:27,656
THANK YOU.

228
00:15:27,656 --> 00:15:29,200
HELLO,
- HI.

229
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,534
- OH.
- I’M SO GLAD YOU’RE BACK.

230
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:32,954
JACK IS DRIVING ME CRAZY.

231
00:15:32,954 --> 00:15:33,955
- THIS’LL SHUT HIM UP.

232
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:35,122
- LET’S GO TO WORK.
- OKAY.

233
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:36,332
AND I WANT TO HEAR
ALL ABOUT THIS.

234
00:15:36,332 --> 00:15:38,541
- BLACK RHINO POPULATIONS
OF AFRICA

235
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,627
CONTINUALLY ON THE ROAD
TO OBLIVION.

236
00:15:40,627 --> 00:15:41,253
[gunshot]

237
00:15:41,253 --> 00:15:46,050
A SPECIES WHICH HAS BEEN AROUND
FOR 65 MILLION YEARS

238
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:46,884
HAS, IN THE LAST DECADE,

239
00:15:46,884 --> 00:15:48,468
BEEN BROUGHT TO THE BRINK
OF EXTINCTION.

240
00:15:48,468 --> 00:15:52,223
MAN’S GREED AND POPULATIONS
CONTINUE UNHARNESSED.

241
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:55,809
- THIS IS SOME OF THE FOOTAGE
THAT HE’S SHOT OVER THE YEARS.

242
00:15:55,809 --> 00:15:58,896
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
COME UP WITH SOMETHING LIGHT,

243
00:15:58,896 --> 00:16:00,647
SOMETHING ENTERTAINING.

244
00:16:00,647 --> 00:16:03,109
WE PUT THIS ON, IT’S DEATH.

245
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:04,110
IT’S DEPRESSING.

246
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,027
NOBODY WANTS TO SEE IT.

247
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:07,737
BESIDES, THEY CAN SEE IT
ON THE 6:00 NEWS.

248
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:12,118
WHAT WE NEED
IS SOMETHING SPECIAL.

249
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:14,870
- EXACTLY, JACK.

250
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,748
AND THIS IS SPECIAL.

251
00:16:18,748 --> 00:16:22,461
VARTY LIVES IN A TREE
OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BUSH.

252
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:26,756
HE SPENDS HIS ENTIRE LIFE
FILMING WILDLIFE.

253
00:16:26,756 --> 00:16:28,926
HE’S DEDICATED THE LAST 12 YEARS

254
00:16:28,926 --> 00:16:30,970
TO FOLLOWING
A SINGLE FEMALE LEOPARD

255
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,098
THROUGH EIGHT LITTERS OF CUBS.

256
00:16:34,098 --> 00:16:35,057
HE’S CAPTURED ON FILM

257
00:16:35,057 --> 00:16:39,979
SOME OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR
LEOPARD FOOTAGE EVER SHOT.

258
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:44,442
TO TOP IT ALL OFF,
SHE NOW HAS TWO NEW CUBS

259
00:16:44,442 --> 00:16:48,570
THAT I’VE HAD
THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING.

260
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,449
THERE’S A GREAT STORY HERE.

261
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:58,164
- NOT BAD, CHRIS.

262
00:16:58,164 --> 00:16:59,331
NOT BAD AT ALL.

263
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:03,210
I WANT TO SEE A BUDGET
AND A FULL PROPOSAL.

264
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:09,341
THANK YOU.

[snarling and roaring]

269
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,764
GET OUT!

270
00:18:23,764 --> 00:18:26,226
GET OUT OF THERE!

WATCH THESE TREES.

276
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:17,818
KEEP GOING.
KEEP GOING.

277
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:20,363
SHE WENT LEFT, ELMON.

278
00:19:20,363 --> 00:19:22,823
WATCH OUT.

279
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,789

[snarling]

284
00:19:42,594 --> 00:19:45,722

IN THE MORNING TO FIND HER.

285
00:19:45,722 --> 00:19:47,057
- OKAY.

[both speaking

290
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:46,449
- OKAY.

296
00:22:38,849 --> 00:22:42,187
- FOR ME, SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN
THE ULTIMATE SURVIVOR.

297
00:22:42,187 --> 00:22:46,732
FOR 12 YEARS, SHE HAD BEEN
MY STRENGTH, MY INSPIRATION.

298
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:50,986
PERHAPS I’D EVEN BELIEVED
SHE WAS INVINCIBLE.

299
00:22:50,986 --> 00:22:53,697
THE LIONS HAD CORNERED HER
MANY TIMES IN THE PAST,

300
00:22:53,697 --> 00:22:57,910
BUT THE YEARS
HAD SUDDENLY TAKEN THEIR TOLL.

301
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,620
SHE WAS NO LONGER AS AGILE,

302
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,457
AND NATURE ALLOWS
FOR NO WEAKNESS.

303
00:23:02,457 --> 00:23:06,627
FOR SO MANY YEARS, WE HAD SHARED
HER TRIUMPHS, HER SORROWS.

304
00:23:06,627 --> 00:23:09,089
SHE WAS MY SOUL MATE,

305
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:11,091
AND NOW SHE WAS DYING.

306
00:23:40,703 --> 00:23:42,955
- THE BUDGET.

307
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:43,664
- UH-OH.

308
00:23:43,664 --> 00:23:45,208
- I KNOW.
I’M TRYING TO BRING IT DOWN.

309
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:48,752
- DAN, I HAD VALERIE
DO SOME GROUNDWORK

310
00:23:48,752 --> 00:23:49,712
ON THIS VARTY CHARACTER.

311
00:23:49,712 --> 00:23:50,880
HE’S A BIT OF A LOOSE CANNON.

312
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,382
NEVER REALLY BROUGHT ANYTHING
IN ON TIME.

313
00:23:52,382 --> 00:23:55,552
PROBABLY DOESN’T KNOW THE
MEANING OF THE WORD "BUDGET."

314
00:23:55,552 --> 00:23:56,469
- OH, COME ON, JACK.

315
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:58,513
- CHRIS, DON’T GET ME WRONG.
I’M ON YOUR SIDE.

316
00:23:58,513 --> 00:24:01,474
IT’S JUST I DON’T WANT TO HAVE
TO COME IN AND CLEAN UP WHEN--

317
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:03,767
EXCUSE ME--
IF THINGS GET OUT OF CONTROL.

318
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:06,396
- WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT, JACK?

319
00:24:06,396 --> 00:24:08,731
- CAN YOU DELIVER THIS TIME?

320
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:10,066
- OKAY, JACK.
WE GET THE POINT.

321
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:12,860
AND EVERYONE KNOWS THAT WHAT
HAPPENED WITH THE LAST PROJECT

322
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,237
WAS NOT ENTIRELY
CHRISTINE’S FAULT.

323
00:24:14,237 --> 00:24:16,406

OF PROJECT WE REALLY NEED.

324

- DIFFERENT.

- IT’S HIGH-PROFILE.

326
00:24:18,782 --> 00:24:20,993
IT’S THE KIND OF THING
THAT CAN PULL US BACK UP.

327

I’M COUNTING ON YOU, KID.
