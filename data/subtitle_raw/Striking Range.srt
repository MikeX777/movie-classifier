1
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:51,273
The employees are not gonna get nervous
and call the Federals, are they?

2
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,046
What do you expect
when you make them bait?

3
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:56,384
Don't worry,
I've shut down all the outbound calls.

4
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,390
He may have a future as a cyber-athlete.

5
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,227
You know, some people make a living
playing those computer games.

6
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,860
Sitting at a computer console playing
first-person shooter games 24 hours a day

7
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:14,100
does not make you an athlete,
it makes you a college applicant reject.

8
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,272
Go on, move! Move! Move! Move!

9
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,539
God, I always wondered what it'd be like

10
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:24,344
sitting in a Trojan horse
all day and all night.

11
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,947
They just couldn't stay away
from the fabled pot of gold.

12
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:31,817
Move! Move!

13
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,892
God. it looks like they got Sharon.

14
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:40,660
I told her to leave. If she wants
to be bait, I say let her be bait.

15
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,435
You got our full payment up front, right?

16
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,940
- What's she doing here anyway?
- She likes Vash.

17
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,770
She's whacked.

18
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,846
You know, the other day, her eyes
were rolling in the back of her head.

19
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:56,347
She was complaining of a headache.

20
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,976
You know, so I asked her,
you know, if I could get her something,

21
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,885
you know, like a glass of water.
She sends me to the damn pharmacy.

22
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,822
Cost me over a hundred bucks.
Hasn't paid me back yet.

23
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:10,191
That is nothing. I went to the pharmacy
to get Denise's nebulizer. $160.

24
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,122
- I Tave in position?
- Yeah.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,058
You know, I’m telling you

26
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,434
your son is one of the best
computer game players I’ve ever seen.

27
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:24,102
Last summer, he spent 10 hours a day,
every day, playing that damn game.

28
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:27,078
If you had kids,
you'd change your tune, trust me.

29
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,582
All right, I can see them all now.

30
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,447
Mabe baby, let's open this Trojan horse.

31
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,750
All right, Tave, we're moving.

32
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:37,747
Rule number one, people?

33
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,883
- We do not take a bullet...
- For a client.

34
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:40,983
Amen.

35
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,793
Combination!

36
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,559
You know what I’d like to see?

37
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,192
They've got steering wheels
for the driving games, right?

38
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,496
Like, joysticks that vibrate

39
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,264
and all kinds of stuff
for the flight sim games.

40
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:55,034
What they need is a gun or a rifle
for these first-person shooter games.

41
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,632
I’m sure they have them.

42
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,112
Yeah, you'd have to aim, reload.
Have sensors so you can duck and stuff.

43
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,714
And then maybe a foot pedal

44
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:07,548
to control your movements
and where you face, instead of a mouse.

45
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,645
Any women play
these first-person shooter games?

46
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,053
Not you too, huh?

47
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,524
I’d say less than 5%.

48
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,261
So it's just a bunch of pale-skinned guys,

49
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,526
sitting around, whose only meaningful
relationships are with their DSL?

50
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,624
Right? is that what it is?

51
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,568
- Yeah, those losers.
- All right. This hallway is clear.

52
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,899
Thank God.

53
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:32,206
- There's nothing here.
- She's right. There's nothing here!

54
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:37,074
All right, all right.
We'll start beating her hand.

55
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,084
I don't have the combination!

56
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,620
You don't have to have it! No.

57
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,218
You don't know what you're up against.

58
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,418
it doesn't matter.
They're gonna kill us anyway, Sharon.

59
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:52,427
Sharon. Sharon Careington,
here in the flesh.

60
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,592
Your daddy is gonna get real pissed off.

61
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,476
One guard, four hostages.

62
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,989
So much for surprise.

63
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:28,630
You know, Mabe, his son, Robert, is good.
He's real good.

64
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,693
See, that's exactly why I can't wait
for you to get married and have kids.

65
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,673
People running around cyberspace,
killing each other with guns, is not real.

66
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,074
At least if he makes a mistake online,
he lives another day.

67
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,476
Hey, hey, come on now, I shushed her.

68
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,242
- She didn't shut up.
- What? I should shoot her?

69
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,220
Move it! Sit down! Move! Move! Move! Move!
Sit down! Don't look up!

70
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,051
Oh, my God, they're gonna kill us all.
Look at this.

71
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,921
Look at this. They're lining us up.
They're gonna kill us all one at a time.

72
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,051
Somebody say something,
do something to these people.

73
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,461
Oh, my God, my wife.
I have a wife and a little girl at home.

74
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,663
I just ordered a sports car.
Haven't even driven it yet.

75
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,734
I love my car.

76
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,783
You guys are getting sloppy.

77
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,385
All right, Tave,
you and Mabe take care of these people.

78
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,220
We'll clean up the last little bit.

79
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,920
Please don't kill me yet.
I just bought a new HDTV.

80
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,658
My wife hasn't finished her boob job.
Please don't shoot me.

81
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,030
The other day, Robert was
the last member of his team, right?

82
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,592
- Yeah.
- His instincts were great, man.

83
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,230
He was up against four pretty good players,
he took each one of them out,

84
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,740
the last one with a wall shot.
He won the game.

85
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,236
Precisely my point. It's a game.

86
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,576
It's not just a game, man.
You can make a living in the CPL.

87
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,714
- All right, freeze! Freeze!
- Move that! Move it! Move in there!

88
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,811
Move back! Move back! Move back!

89
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,549
- Don't listen to him! Shoot!
- What did I say?

90
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:01,286
- What did I tell you?
- You bastard. My father will have you killed.

91
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,989
You shut up, bitch!
Drop your gun right now!

92
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,928
- Drop it right now!
- Robert spent so much time...

93
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,228
- Drop the gun right now!
- ... on that game.

94
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,893
I’m just starting to get
a little bit jealous.

95
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,096
Just think of all the hand-eye coordination
he's getting

96
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,071
- from the hours spent on the mouse.
- Right.

97
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,630
Drop your gun right now!

98
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,472
I’m telling you guys!
Drop your gun right now!

99
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,208
- You're a dead man! Don't listen to him.
- You shut up!

100
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,613
You got those SS109's?
All I have are these soft 7.62's.

101
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:25,742
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah.

102
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,046
- No.
- Yes.

103
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,144
- No.
- Yes.

104
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,552
Put your gun down right now!

105
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:32,887
- Or I’ll shoot her right now!
- We haven't been paid yet.

106
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,621
Shoot the bastard! Now! I order you!

107
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,290
She is ordering us.

108
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:41,197
- Drop your gun right now!
- Shoot!

109
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,901
Mabe, come on in, bring your med kit.

110
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,786
You tell him what...
Don't, don't let him tell you what to do.

111
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:45,956
Oh, the MVP Award?

112
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,660
How can you call him a little girl
when you're the one who screamed?

113
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,599
- You know what? I didn't just...
- You're the one who screamed.

114
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,967
You won't let it go. And you.

115
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,199
You know how much coffee I had
to drink to talk that fast?

116
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,433
I will tell you one other thing.

117
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,806
The next time I send you inside
you are going in as a deaf mute.

118
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,402
- Robert De Niro you ain't.
- Okay, deaf mute.

119
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,840
Welcome to Billings Laboratories.
How may I direct your call?

120
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,016
I'm sorry. Mr. Billings
isn't taking any calls.

121
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,555
Would you like to speak
with his assistant, Monica?

122
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:22,686
Emily, I want you in on the test.
But no one else. And it'll be Lab C.

123
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:38,206
- Why not the main lab?
- Magnetic shielding issues.

124
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,177
I don't give a damn about shielding.

125
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,680
I just don't want
the mongrels watching this.

126
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,716
That's how rumors get started.

127
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,348
Power levels are ready.

128
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,419
Distance to target would be

129
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,152
thirty-six inches.

130
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,119
- Everything's set.
- What did you tell them?

131
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,598
That you wanted to
run some tests yourselves.

132
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,034
And no, they don't think it's ready yet.

133
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:08,867
- But you did finish the...
- Yes, Dad. It's ready.

134
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:12,342
Yeah. Well, we'll see.

135
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,350
Initiating pre-sequence.

136
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,750
- Power to 80.
- 80.

137
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,819
Initiating primary trigger.

138
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,021
Now.

139
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,648
The hole's diameter is two inches.

140
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:03,829
Depth is 4.5 inches.

141
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,725
4.5 inches?

142
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,028
It's three inches more than...

143
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,171
- We did it!
- We?

144
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,191
- it doesn't seem very warm.
- It's not supposed to be.

145
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:38,728
it doesn't split. it separates the quarks,
destabilizing the atom.

146
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,790
But a destabilized atom...

147
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,390
The quarks come together,

148
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:47,201
held by gluon to create stable atoms
and thus stable molecules.

149
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,434
You see, what my father found was that

150
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,877
by neutralizing the gluon he could
create a concentrated particle beam.

151
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,276
Where the hole is now, it didn't explode?

152
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:01,843
it separated, Emily.
it separated at the most basic level.

153
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,950
The atoms ceased to bond.

154
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,187
So it worked?

155
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:13,058
- Three inches deeper than I expected.
- And we should be able to increase that.

156
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:17,159
- Well, the client will be thrilled.
- No, they won't be.

157
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:21,736
And, as head of my security team,
I’ll need you at the meeting.

158
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:35,343
Brice, I’m sure that he knows
that he couldn't have done this without you.

159
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:39,583
There are some shielding problems
with the power supply.

160
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:43,890
You wanted this portable. We're gonna need
to redesign some elements.

161
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,793
We're 40% over budget in development

162
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,934
and now you want us to go back,
back to the drawing board?

163
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:55,167
You'd be more unhappy if you took
possession of something that doesn't work.

164
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,937
Yes, but we expect results.

165
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,478
We'll eat some of the overages ourselves.

166
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,078
We'll talk again in a month.

167
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:08,386
Dr. Billings, I think you need to understand
that these people that I represent

168
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,321
are very serious people.

169
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,949
Look, I went to work for you guys
to give you my absolute best.

170
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,924
That's what I’m gonna do.

171
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,491
Yes, you are. I’ll be in touch.

172
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:32,666
Brice. Take the prototype and hide it.

173
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:37,978
Clean the computer as well.
You try and help some people...

174
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,962
Emily didn't inform me
you were coming down, sir.

175
00:13:55,267 --> 00:14:00,466
Let's see.
Is Emily my boss? Or am I Emily's boss?

176
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,604
Of course, sir.

177
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,390
You're out of water again.

178
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:17,110
I brought you your candy bar.
It's one of one of your favorites. I’ll...

179
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:20,816
I’ll just leave it here for you.

180
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,516
Now I need you to do me a favor.

181
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,793
I need you to watch this crate for me.

182
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,196
It's very important.

183
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,900
Can I count on you, Shawn?

184
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,848
- Trouble?
- It's gone. The crazy bastard.

185
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:31,052
Hey. It's gone.
And the computer's been wiped clean.

186
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,262
I don't know. If you don't put together
something tonight, we're screwed.

187
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,935
- What did you find?
- Nothing. Just Brice's entry.

188
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,569
And I talked to the guard.
He complained about Brice.

189
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,473
I wouldn't worry about that. Take a look.

190
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:58,106
- I don't see anything.
- You see that?

191
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,744
There's a record of something there.

192
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:07,317
- I do see it. Somebody changed something.
- Somebody on the inside.

193
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,522
Well, I will find him.
I’ll get my team right on it.

194
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,463
In the meantime,
you'll bring in some outside help.

195
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,001
- Sir, my security department...
- Is compromised.

196
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:22,068
Put them somewhere else.
You had a break-in at the Fort Worth plant.

197
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,042
You get your people on that today.

198
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,006
- Sir...
- I don't want them here.

199
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,417
I’ve been watching you, Emily.

200
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,954
There is only four people
who know that this thing works.

201
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:42,022
Well, I haven't said anything.

202
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,393
I know. Keep it that way.

203
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,029
Now, I’m gonna need
some serious protection,

204
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,129
more than your staff can handle.

205
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,940
Get me that guy we gave the Malaysian
operation to several years ago.

206
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,170
He was good.

207
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,243
What was his name?
Bash, Basher, something.

208
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,679
- Vasher. With a "V."
- Yeah, yeah, that's him.

209
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,018
What do we tell him?

210
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:16,520
That a stalker took a dump in my bed,
left life-threatening notes.

211
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,326
Hell, you can tell him I’m being chased
by werewolves, I don't care.

212
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,593
Okay.

213
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:27,194
- I’ll tell him to pack the wooden stakes.
- Silver bullets.

214
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:31,402
- Sir?
- Yeah, it's silver bullets with werewolves.

215
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,638
Right.

216
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,847
Am I the only one that knows this shit?

217
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,044
Yeah. He asked for you.

218
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,717
No, not by me.

219
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,013
I wouldn't say that.

220
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,522
- Well, let me think about it.
- Well, don't take too long.

221
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,994
You start tonight.

222
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:55,129
- Can you wire the first half today?
- I'm sure accounting can do that.

223
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,058
Fine, I'll tell them.

224
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,940
We move fast,
we drop everybody who gets in the way.

225
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,006
Except Billings, of course.

226
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,372
- What about...
- That's not gonna be a problem.

227
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,308
Questions?

228
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,985
He's bringing in
some private contractors as well.

229
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,351
Yeah, that's why we've got to move quick.

230
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,653
The good news is
they're having trouble paying some bills.

231
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,188
Looks like I’m gonna need
my Fed suit again.

232
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,926
The Careington job is done. Over.
It's time to move on.

233
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,987
I’ll file it under Mosul,
Houston and Santa Clarita.

234
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,260
Hey, Santa Clarita was not my fault.

235
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,970
Honey, could you go see if your mom
needs your help in the kitchen?

236
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,335
Hey, shortcake.

237
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,140
Vash, it's bad. Real bad.

238
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,841
I was hoping Careington
would pay the balance.

239
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,416
- They still might.
- You don't have a family.

240
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,915
You know, you're the best tactical guy
I’ve ever seen.

241
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:33,094
I mean, in that realm, you are the man,
but nobody, nobody's great at everything.

242
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,032
Nobody does everything A plus.

243
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,163
- Let me handle the business.
- No, that's my job.

244
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,567
- So, let me help.
- No.

245
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,812
Emily called.

246
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,882
- Emily Johansson? I thought...
- Yeah.

247
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,781
Yeah, she called anyway.
She has a job for us.

248
00:20:56,855 --> 00:21:00,052
- Wants us to do bodyguard work.
- That's not our style.

249
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,956
That's what I told her, "No thanks. "

250
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:04,996
She works over at Billings.
Billings Lab, right?

251
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,190
- Yep.
- That billionaire guy?

252
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,765
- Yep.
- Does it pay a lot?

253
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,104
What's the point?
We don't do bodyguard work.

254
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,300
it pays a lot.

255
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,512
Hey, Robert! Robert!

256
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,348
Wait, wait. Hold, hold, hold.
You guys aren't going out now are you?

257
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,412
We talked about this already.

258
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:33,549
- You said it was okay.
- No we didn't.

259
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,593
You, me and Denise were supposed
to all go out together.

260
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,152
Look, I’ll be back home later tonight.

261
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,564
You said it was okay already.

262
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,967
Thanks. Let's go, guys.

263
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,130
Body guarding isn't one of your three rules.

264
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,243
- Don't take a bullet...
- For a client.

265
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,040
- Always...
- Plan.

266
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,981
And don't go against the U.S. government.

267
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,153
You're right.
Body guarding isn't one of the three.

268
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:09,887
Well.

269
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:14,357
The time for planning isn't great,
but the other two seem to fit.

270
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:19,335
I’ve already sent Tave ahead.
Building maintenance.

271
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:22,304
So we start tonight. They pay up front?

272
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:30,976
Vash, dinero, dollars and cents.
Come on, brother, I need it.

273
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,210
Two weeks. That's not gonna cut it.

274
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:35,985
Are you in or not?

275
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:48,329
Dig it.
All right, I’ve got to collect a few things.

276
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,894
I’ll swing back by here in one hour.
Have Mabe meet us here then.

277
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:23,264
- Thanks, Dad!
- You're welcome.

278
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,462
- Bye, Mr. Hatem!
- Bye, Amanda.

279
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,473
What's up with Mom?

280
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:31,735
Go enjoy your friends, sweetie.

281
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:36,636
Agent Kilmer, FBI.
I've got an offer you're gonna want to hear.

282
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,964
Eugene. Here's yours, John.

283
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,767
- And you must be Mabe.
- Yeah. Hi.

284
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,105
Hi. Well, let me get you guys situated.

285
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,875
Billings works until 9:00 most evenings
and then heads home.

286
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:45,007
Most of the employees leave at 5:00 to 5:30.
Monday's a holiday.

287
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,983
Should be a real quiet night.

288
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,543
We have a central room
for security operations.

289
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:52,818
Some parts of the facility
are under pretty tight lock and key.

290
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,018
Now, I will always cover Billings
when he's moving.

291
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:58,426
When he's not, I lead the first shift
and you guys cover the other two.

292
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,988
- You were once Secret Service, right?
- Yes.

293
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,190
Yeah.

294
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,030
Does he stay in his office while he's here?

295
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:07,003
Yes, usually.
And when he's not, I will let you know.

296
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,632
One will be in advance
and the other behind.

297
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:14,941
Now, this is the security operations.
I always have somebody here.

298
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,573
They've been instructed
on what they can provide you with.

299
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:20,948
I’ll need the building schematics as well
as a floor plan of the Billings' house

300
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,044
and the routes getting to and from.

301
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,055
Absolutely. Judd can help you.

302
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,449
Eugene?

303
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,696
So, what kind of threat are we looking at?

304
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,795
Nothing much.

305
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:44,035
Billings is just spooked out
by some threatening letters.

306
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,638
You don't feel the need
for extra protection?

307
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,204
Well, that answers the question
about the last time.

308
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:20,472
Okay. I guess I deserve that.
I’m not good at that confrontation stuff.

309
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:24,340
Bullshit, Vash!
You confront just fine when it suits you.

310
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,777
I deserve to know why.

311
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:31,417
I don't suppose it would help to say
that I made a huge mistake,

312
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:32,854
that I was selfish?

313
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,858
No, no. it doesn't help.

314
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:37,987
Not a bit.

315
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,132
Can we start over?

316
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,998
What, wipe the slate clean? A fresh start?
Make believe it didn't happen?

317
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,201
Any of those happy clichés? Hell, no.

318
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:55,337
You can pretend that the injury
isn't there, but I still have the scars.

319
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,875
All right. That's fair.

320
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,985
I don't know how, but apparently
we're gonna have to work together now.

321
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,092
You do look great, Em.

322
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:10,687
Mr. Vasher? Ted Billings.

323
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,855
- Don't know if you remember me.
- Of course I do, sir.

324
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,195
This is my son, Brice.

325
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:20,226
He's got an I.Q. higher than me
and still stupid. Got that from his mother.

326
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,405
Well, let's sit down.

327
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:28,009
I know this is probably just a milk run
for somebody like yourself.

328
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,912
The truth is
I think someone's coming after me.

329
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,883
What do you base that on, sir, the threats?

330
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,750
No. Somebody's got it out for me.

331
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:40,985
I’m sure it's just some kind of harmless
nut, but they can be the worst kind.

332
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:43,922
Probably one of the union leeches
that lost his job.

333
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,795
"Each according to his abilities,
each according to his needs. "

334
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,493
You know who said that?

335
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:54,127
- Abraham Lincoln?
- No. Lenin.

336
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,171
I thought he wrote,
"Imagine all the people... "

337
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:02,509
Not that one, dumb shit.
The first leader of the Soviet communists.

338
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:06,717
Yes, sir. Do you have any specific
union leech in mind? You have a name?

339
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:10,152
What does it matter?
They're all part of the same damn mafia.

340
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,853
Just keep me safe for the next few weeks.
Can you do that?

341
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,688
That's affirmative, sir.

342
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,363
Mr. Billings, about this wire...

343
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,662
Mr. Vasher, I don't do the accounting.

344
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,967
That's why
I have an accounting department.

345
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,669
If you have a question for them,
pick up the phone and call them.

346
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,534
Anything else?

347
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,079
- No, sir.
- Real good.

348
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,649
I’ll be here till 10:00.
Then I’m going home.

349
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,618
- Why are you playing with him?
- Why do you say that?

350
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:51,628
You have a political science degree, Vash.
Abraham Lincoln.

351
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,998
If somebody's really
after him, he's done for.

352
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,761
Yeah? And I thought you were the best.

353
00:28:56,835 --> 00:29:00,134
I am, as long as I have all the information.

354
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:05,038
I’ll call down to accounting for you.

355
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:09,641
By the way, it's Karl Marx,
not Vladimir Lenin.

356
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,948
- Where'd you put it?
- Haskell.

357
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:19,083
What the hell's Haskell?

358
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,350
The old warehouse?
There's no security there.

359
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:27,091
Dad, sometimes the best hiding place
is just right out in the open.

360
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:29,492
Hell, no!

361
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,432
What were you thinking? You go get it.

362
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,900
No, never mind.

363
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:40,207
I’ll get it tonight
after the conference call with Malaysia.

364
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:44,270
Take it to the house.
You pick me up in the garage at 9:00 p. m.

365
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,480
Hey! You taking your medication?

366
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,015
I will put you back.

367
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,659
Ought to be the poster child
for birth control.

368
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:01,587
Brice.

369
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,928
Milk run, huh?

370
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:08,897
So, has... Hi.
Has anyone talked to you about the...

371
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,878
- About what?
- It's really more of an office legend.

372
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,339
Legend?

373
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,283
Oh, a couple of mysterious deaths,
unexplained.

374
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,217
But... Gotta run.

375
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:35,296
You know, for such a high level of access,
there sure are a lot of closed doors.

376
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,631
Well, that's the thing about this place.

377
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,193
Left hand doesn't know
what the right arm is doing.

378
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:41,295
Hand.

379
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,833
Right hand, left hand.

380
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,202
Never mind.

381
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,473
Mabe, after you get this set up,
you can head on home.

382
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:50,605
You've got first shift tomorrow.

383
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,515
Meet at Billings at 6:00 a. m.
and relieve Hatem and myself.

384
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,416
I don't know
what the hell I’m doing with Tave yet.

385
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:58,114
Copy that. All right, here's your PDA.

386
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:01,417
It's got all the files on it
from the Billings house.

387
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,393
At least the latest that's on file
with the Planning and Zoning Commission.

388
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:08,193
All right, great. I’ll leave this here.
I’ll call Tave and have him come pick it up.

389
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:09,358
All right.

390
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:12,536
Listen, Judd. it is Judd, right?

391
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,138
What's this about an "office legend"?

392
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,408
Billings' son Brice
mentioned something about it.

393
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,606
He thinks something's wandering around
killing people.

394
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:37,416
Good.

395
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,665
Shawn, did you
take the motorcycle out again?

396
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,358
- How are you?
- Fine.

397
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,252
it clears out pretty early around here,
doesn't it?

398
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:13,490
Yes ma'am.
After 5:30, there's not many people left.

399
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:16,294
I’ll be back bright and early,
that's for sure.

400
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,227
Thank you, ma'am.

401
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:19,892
Thanks.

402
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:27,005
Yeah, sorry, no I.D., no appointment.

403
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:30,980
I’m just here to kidnap and torture Billings
to get some information.

404
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,409
I took care of the stairwell cameras.

405
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:39,388
- The doors are locked from the inside.
- Got it.

406
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,760
Remember, when I give you the signal,
kill the power.

407
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,114
He's in the power room. Let's go.

408
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,424
Some of these floors
have very little security.

409
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,527
We don't need it on every floor.

410
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,669
I’ll be walking the halls.

411
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,775
Enjoy your trip.

412
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:53,543
He's on a conference call right now
that should be finishing up at any time.

413
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:56,781
He also said something about
running an errand on the way home.

414
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,482
- Where?
- He hasn't mentioned it to me yet.

415
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,482
You know, in the meantime,
I can cover Billings.

416
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,256
So if you guys want to take a break,
feel free.

417
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,393
- A break?
- Yeah.

418
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:11,526
There's an employee lounge one floor down
and on the other side of the building.

419
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,502
- It's really nice.
- A break.

420
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,464
Yeah, yeah. A break, Vash.
She said we could take a break.

421
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,773
- I’m not hungry.
- Vash, go take a break.

422
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,646
You really dig this corporate stuff, huh?

423
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:27,081
They say if you can win the rat race,
you get to call your own shots.

424
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:30,518
I’ve heard that winning the rat race
makes you number one rat.

425
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,488
- Break time.
- Yeah, I think I’m gonna take a break.

426
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,149
Break time. Break time.

427
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,940
That was harsh, Vash.
She was just trying to be nice.

428
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,040
You know...

429
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,630
Okay, kill the lights.

430
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:25,899
Killing the computers,
exterior and elevators.

431
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:28,239
Killing the main now.

432
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,517
Bob?

433
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:44,988
- Great.
- What the hell was that?

434
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,189
Tave, check power.

435
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,069
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

436
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:15,785
Shots fired.

437
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:24,060
What the hell was that?
What's going on out there? I lost the call!

438
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:27,565
Get that call back right now
and turn on the lights!

439
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,038
Turn on the damn lights!

440
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,336
Is anyone out there?

441
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,794
Get the phone and the lights back on.

442
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,961
Sounds like he's okay.

443
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,601
Vash, we've got to get him out of here.

444
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,368
Emily, you'd better make damn sure
it's safe up here.

445
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,000
Let me check this out.

446
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:07,900
John.

447
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,215
Okay, regroup in the garage.

448
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,620
Looks like the power's been turned off.

449
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,957
Computers and elevators
are still on-line though. Stand by.

450
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,347
I’ve got a bad feeling about this.

451
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:28,447
Yeah, but why didn't they snatch Billings?

452
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,328
Maybe they didn't want to tangle with us?

453
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,857
How do you like me now, bitch?

454
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,606
Power's gonna be out for a while.

455
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:33,250
Tave, call Mabe and get her moving.
Truck, full kit. I don't like this stairwell.

456
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,916
Well, the elevators might still be on.

457
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,085
What about the stairwell
on the other side of the building?

458
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,150
Sir!

459
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:39,654
I'm not coming out until I know it's safe.

460
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,927
I’m telling you, Emily,
this is no pissed-off union worker.

461
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,128
We've got one body in the stairwell,
clean as a whistle.

462
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,465
Sir, we need to get you out of here.

463
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:51,666
All right, let's move.

464
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,844
I’m in the parking garage. Move in.

465
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:03,139
Elevators are still on.

466
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,744
That's nice, but I still want to use
the other stairwell.

467
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,011
I don't wanna get stuck in a box.

468
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:12,250
Sir, come on.

469
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:20,250
That other stairwell
will be around this way to the left.

470
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,860
You remember that time
you wore that little black dress

471
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:27,419
- when we went to that restaurant on top of...
- Vash, please.

472
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,524
it was the last time
we were on a dark floor together.

473
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,972
We really had something, Em.

474
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,973
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

475
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:49,742
You know, you get to the point in your life
when you can look back

476
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,311
and see the biggest mistake you ever made.

477
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:57,452
Hey, make war, not love.

478
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,403
You almost got shot, son.

479
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,281
- Get him out of here!
- Mr. Billings.

480
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,852
Our garage is closed right now.

481
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:04,121
I got three, maybe four targets
with automatics.

482
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:28,413
Damn it.

483
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,684
- Copy that.
- Look, we've got to get him out of here.

484
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,524
- Negative. Parking garage is O.B.
- What does that mean?

485
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,894
The parking garage is hot, sir.
We cannot go down there right now.

486
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:46,061
No, no, no. This is crazy.
We'll take the other stairwell.

487
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,569
Look, we don't know what we're up against.

488
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,765
We might walk into something
we're not equipped to handle.

489
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,207
Well, too late for that. Stairwell C.

490
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:56,204
Tave. Sitrep, stairwell C.

491
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,248
Negative. Leads to the same parking garage.

492
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,976
Sir. Sir!

493
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,384
You know,
maybe we should all just stick together?

494
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:03,942
Sure, why not?

495
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:47,986
Miss, stay in there
and keep the door shut, please.

496
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,243
Oh, good. You're gonna make me do this.

497
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,356
You okay?

498
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:02,793
Sun Tzu says to pitch the battle
on the field of your choice.

499
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,192
All right, get the men,
regroup down the road.

500
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,464
Mr. Billings?

501
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,059
Sir?

502
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:56,499
Emily?

503
00:52:58,208 --> 00:53:00,904
Well, whoever that was is gone now.
Situation?

504
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:03,878
Tave did a firefight,
then a lower stairwell.

505
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:09,441
Billings bolted at the fourth floor offices,
Emily pursued and I’m trying to locate them.

506
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:17,026
Parking garage is clear.

507
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:40,074
Easy. What's going on? Who are you?

508
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,844
That's exactly what I want to know.

509
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:47,822
Brice Billings. My father told me
to pull the limo around at 9:00.

510
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:50,425
I’m already late, so...

511
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:05,072
Call them all in. Billings will probably go
to where he's keeping it.

512
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:07,041
We'll take care of business there.

513
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:10,412
Yeah, we'll hear from the inside.

514
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:15,850
Look, if you catch up to him,
you hold him till I get there, you got it?

515
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,079
Right.

516
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:22,857
- Hey, how's it going? You good?
- Yeah, yeah, I’m good. How about you?

517
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,826
- I’ve been better.
- Yeah, you got it.

518
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:27,920
- Rally point. Hold this position.
- Yeah, you got it.

519
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:42,343
- Lose something?
- He ran away.

520
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,539
That's what we should be doing.

521
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:48,380
Not me, Vash. This is my job.
I’ve got to find him.

522
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:52,010
Em, what's so important
that people are willing to die here tonight?

523
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,485
- Oh, you're bleeding.
- Yeah.

524
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,893
Here, go take off your
jacket and your shirt.

525
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:09,429
What's going on?

526
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:12,197
Next-generation weapons.

527
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:15,640
For the Department of Defense?

528
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:20,775
Let's just say Billings fulfills a niche market.
He got in early and he knows what he wants.

529
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:22,450
What market?

530
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,148
When Black Ops needs technology,

531
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:29,214
they can't just pop down to
Electronics-R-Us for what they need.

532
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:32,693
Wait a second.
These are government Black Ops people?

533
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:35,492
No, no.

534
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:39,828
There might be other groups that want to
get their hands on some of this technology.

535
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:41,370
Other groups?

536
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:43,270
Your shirt.

537
00:55:55,785 --> 00:55:59,277
So, you have a boyfriend now?

538
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,421
Sorry.

539
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:09,365
I never figured
you'd stick out this corporate thing.

540
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,059
Yeah? Why's that?

541
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:16,029
- You were the most idealistic person I knew.
- Young and stupid, you mean?

542
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,607
I learned from you,

543
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:22,372
if you don't have your own agenda,
you get sucked into somebody else's.

544
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,710
Some people's agendas can be good.

545
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:29,115
Yeah? Well, now who's the idealist?

546
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,986
That's a very funny thought coming from
Mr. "I’ll Do Whatever I Want. "

547
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,648
Well, maybe I’ve changed.

548
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:41,661
Or, at the very least,
in the process of changing.

549
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:47,295
When you left me

550
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:52,899
you left something behind.

551
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,508
That didn't survive.

552
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:16,396
I’m sorry.

553
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:31,174
Yeah, hey, John,

554
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:35,546
we are down one "Over the Hill"
40th birthday party balloon.

555
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:38,284
Copy that. Down one balloon.

556
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:45,419
We need to find Billings.

557
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,759
That shouldn't be too hard.

558
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:52,191
Where would I hide
if I were a narcissistic son of a bitch?

559
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:53,394
Vash.

560
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:57,664
I would look
for the darkest corner of the room

561
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,537
and try to find the darkest place there.

562
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,879
Mr. Billings, the place is secure.
We can leave now.

563
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,752
How can you be so sure?

564
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:15,085
Hey. Mabe's moving.

565
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,649
Coordinate with our route to his house.
Which route we taking?

566
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,628
Just follow us.
You'll be told when you need to know.

567
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:23,857
"Need to know" was about an hour ago.

568
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:24,957
Em?

569
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:28,299
Leave the cell phone at home
next time, man.

570
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,711
You need to level with me.
What's really going on?

571
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:42,342
Nothing. Billings is getting a bit antsy.
I don't want him to just go off again.

572
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,650
Look, I don't think
we're dealing with just one thing here.

573
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:50,716
And one is professional.

574
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,929
Is there any chance that
this group is part of the U.S. government?

575
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:55,055
No.

576
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:01,201
Fair warning, if it is, we're out of here.

577
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:05,706
Fine. Look, we'll take him to his house.
It's a fort.

578
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:16,009
What's going on?

579
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:20,749
Well, it seems a pretty well-armed group
is a little pissed at your dad.

580
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:25,055
Oh, and there's that ninja wanna-be
that attacked us upstairs.

581
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,023
Someone attacked you?

582
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,564
Cut the crap. What do you know?

583
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,731
It's my brother.

584
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,502
- Your brother?
- Yes, my brother.

585
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,172
He has a disease. Porphyria.

586
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:49,007
Makes him insane,
madness of King George, all that stuff.

587
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:51,548
My father

588
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:55,253
keeps him locked up.

589
00:59:57,894 --> 01:00:02,422
Your brother. Well, you better lock him up
tighter before he gets himself killed.

590
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:04,492
Or kills someone.

591
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,166
What's up?

592
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:18,206
So, she's telling you that this has
nothing to do with Uncle Sam, right?

593
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,272
That's what she's saying.

594
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:25,181
I figure we should walk away on this one.

595
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:28,121
Come on, man, don't play.
You got any proof?

596
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,385
No.

597
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,895
- It's just a feeling.
- I hear you.

598
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:10,057
- Who was that?
- Kilmer and his thugs.

599
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:13,297
No, I mean that maniac
that attacked us up there.

600
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:15,695
How the hell would I know?

601
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:22,204
Yeah, Mabe, when we get to Billings' house,
I need you to run me a blood sample.

602
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:25,577
Also, I need a report
on a disease called porphyria.

603
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:28,310
All right, thanks.

604
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,971
What's up with you, man?
I’ve never seen you this nervous.

605
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,846
We should walk, Vash.

606
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:09,649
Those same headlights have been with us
for a few miles. They're gaining.

607
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:13,787
Yeah, they probably were waiting for us
right outside of Billings.

608
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:32,307
- Yeah.
- We've got company.

609
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,216
Can you handle it?

610
01:02:34,283 --> 01:02:36,183
Yeah, but it'd be nice to know
where we're going.

611
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:40,481
Not over the phone.
Just tell him to keep following.

612
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:42,190
Can you just keep following?

613
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:45,386
Probably not.
You're not heading to his house are you?

614
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:47,429
- Just do your best.
- No, bullshit!

615
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:50,591
Billings starts leveling with me,
or all bets are off. We're gonna walk.

616
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:52,031
We don't...

617
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:53,696
You listen up.

618
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:59,072
This is a terrorist group that wants
a very serious piece of technology I have.

619
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:03,201
I will not risk national security
over an unsecured line.

620
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:06,414
Just follow us and keep the bastards off me.

621
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:14,548
John, don't scratch my car.

622
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,919
- Want me to take care of them?
- Yeah. What are you waiting for?

623
01:03:17,994 --> 01:03:20,258
No, no, no! Don't! Don't!
They might be government!

624
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:22,797
Fine. Stand down.

625
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:47,987
Left! Left!

626
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:51,156
Go, man.

627
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:57,129
Are you throwing this fight, John?
Are you throwing this fight?

628
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:02,931
Up here. Up here.

629
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:09,643
- I think they went this way.
- No, they did not, Vash.

630
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:12,537
Hey, who's driving here, me or you?

631
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:18,986
You better hope they went this way.

632
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:25,916
Tave! Tave, give me the phone!
Give me the phone back!

633
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:34,565
She's not answering.

634
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:44,007
John, you'd better tell me
why you sandbagged us.

635
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:51,349
What're you doing? Lose them!

636
01:05:20,516 --> 01:05:23,110
You took money, John. You sold us out.

637
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:26,887
Vash, he came to my house.
What was I supposed to do?

638
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:33,059
- Why?
- it wasn't gonna hurt us.

639
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:37,527
No! No! Not good enough!
You're gonna tell me why!

640
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:42,363
Maggie said she's leaving me.
She's taking my kids away from me, Vash.

641
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:43,996
- What?
- My wife!

642
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:47,572
She's walking out on me
and she's taking my children away from me!

643
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:50,305
I had to do something, Vash!
Nobody else is.

644
01:05:50,379 --> 01:05:52,677
How? How could you do this?
How could you do this, John?

645
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:57,310
Look, it's not just the Careington job.
The Rodgers case. The Monterey job.

646
01:05:57,586 --> 01:05:59,713
- You son of a...
- Vash, enough!

647
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:01,757
- Come on! Let it go!
- You're a piece of shit, John!

648
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:04,452
- Do you hear me? You're a piece of shit!
- Come on!

649
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:06,686
Get off me, Tave!

650
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:14,301
Vash, you know, for you,
this whole thing we do

651
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:17,430
is a noble, noble, grand cause, Vash.

652
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:20,998
But the rest of us, we have to pay bills!

653
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,777
I have bills to pay.

654
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:30,184
You don't cover my ass.

655
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:38,927
You don't.
You'd leave me hanging out there.

656
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:50,767
Come on.

657
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:02,180
I’m telling you, Tave. I’m telling you, man.

658
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:10,621
You know when we met each other
in Desert Storm, we hated each other.

659
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:13,857
Veteran sergeant
and a green lieutenant, right?

660
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:18,626
So we solved it the old-fashioned way.

661
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:22,228
We took our discussion out behind
this house that was there before Abraham.

662
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:25,006
And it took everything that I had,

663
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:28,909
but I finally made that asshole
see it my way!

664
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:37,219
You know, in the olden days,
you strike an officer, it meant death.

665
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:44,389
But instead, that bastard saved my life
three different times.

666
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:50,327
And now this, man...

667
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:53,832
I don't know what to...

668
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:04,844
Come on.

669
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,956
Mabe baby, get me an analysis on these.

670
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:33,126
Sure.

671
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:48,006
Locator's a little weak. We need to
move fast before we lose the signal.

672
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:56,316
- Well, the blood will prove it.
- Prove what?

673
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:58,724
She's not talking to you. Just drive.

674
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:02,890
Porphyria.
The blood doesn't produce enough heme.

675
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:06,230
it causes all sorts of problems,
including mental instability.

676
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:09,669
Mental instability?
What do you mean, like, insanity?

677
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:10,931
Yeah.

678
01:10:12,174 --> 01:10:16,167
Yup, it looks like your friend
from the Billings building has it.

679
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:28,214
Sir, wouldn't we be safer at your house?

680
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:31,453
That's where we'll go
after we pick up the device.

681
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:46,999
It's got a lot of normal elements.
But there's some...

682
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:49,200
There's some traces of chlordane
in it as well.

683
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:53,610
- Chlordane? What's that?
- It's a pesticide.

684
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:55,778
Hold on.

685
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:02,953
Looks like it's a pesticide. Was
discontinued by the U.S. government in 1976.

686
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:06,756
Could a porphyria patient
possibly use that as a treatment?

687
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:09,821
No, I wouldn't think so.
I should think it'd make it worse.

688
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:13,265
So, a factory, an old warehouse
that manufactured it, that's the site.

689
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:15,929
- That's where he could be staying.
- It's possible, yeah.

690
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:18,565
Tave, where's the locator taking us?

691
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:21,406
Towards the southeast part of town.

692
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:24,002
Bingo. The industrial section.

693
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:29,851
I think this porphyria guy
hasn't given up on Billings.

694
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:46,593
- I don't like this.
- We'll get the device and get out of here.

695
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:54,799
Give me a hand.

696
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:58,338
Brice, grab the other side.

697
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,082
No, Shawn, I can do this myself.

698
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:06,581
- Who are you talking to?
- My brother.

699
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,988
- You don't have a brother.
- Yes, I do!

700
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:19,360
- Brice, get this off of me.
- Shut up!

701
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:22,069
Don't do it!

702
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:25,265
- Okay. It's just a cell phone.
- Don't do it!

703
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:28,067
- It's just a cell phone. Okay.
- Put it down! Put it down!

704
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:29,810
Put it down!

705
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,245
Put it down!

706
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:34,714
- Brice!
- Shut up!

707
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:37,578
- Come here. Come here.
- Okay.

708
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:42,315
You see, Shawn?
I told you I could have her.

709
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:48,428
Yeah, I'm on Highway 26
moving toward the industrial section.

710
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:49,725
Move in.

711
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,533
I gotta take this.

712
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:55,862
Yeah?

713
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,775
The battery's already dying on this locator.

714
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:07,674
The best I can do is this area here.
It's maybe within a block or two.

715
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:10,975
Okay, cross-reference that section
for any of Billings' holdings.

716
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,611
You know, I’m not getting this.

717
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:15,418
Billings has another son who wants
to get even for something?

718
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:17,857
What does that have to do
with Kilmer and his thugs?

719
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:19,416
Maybe nothing.

720
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:24,791
- Mabe, you got that file on Billings?
- Yeah. It's right here.

721
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:34,368
it says here Billings only has one son.

722
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:40,147
All right, I’ve got it.
It's 1400 South Haskell.

723
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:43,843
It's an old warehouse and factory.

724
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:47,287
They used to make pesticides
with chlordane.

725
01:13:56,231 --> 01:14:01,032
I've been noticing
the looks you've been giving me

726
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:09,370
We'd make such a great team.

727
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:14,979
You know what, Brice?

728
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:18,711
You're right. I have been looking at you.
You don't need the gun.

729
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:21,015
Oh, that's good.

730
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:27,526
All right, here's the latest copies
of the floor plan on file with the city.

731
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:29,826
That's probably 20 years old.

732
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:40,764
They're gonna be pissed
you're not working for them anymore.

733
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:43,869
They're gonna take back
more than their money.

734
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:48,873
Maggie's packing the kids up right now.
She won't even tell me where she's going.

735
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,418
You know, man, I’m no marriage counselor,

736
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:59,154
but it seems to me this relationship needs
more than just a quick infusion of cash.

737
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:02,163
You're right. You're no marriage counselor.

738
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:10,300
Is it too late, bro?

739
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,998
I don't know.

740
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:17,175
Hey.

741
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:23,376
I’m not giving you any reason
to take other money ever again.

742
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:30,353
We're almost there.

743
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:33,589
Yeah, copy.

744
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:10,197
There's only one child.

745
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:14,361
I don't know what Brice's been feeding you,
but he has no brother.

746
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:42,523
You want to stay here with Mabe
and the truck?

747
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,792
Hell, no.

748
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:46,592
All right, then.

749
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:49,402
Let's do this.

750
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:54,633
- You like that?
- Yeah.

751
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:06,847
Brice!

752
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,452
Vash.

753
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:17,760
I’m sorry, Dad. Let me give you a hand.

754
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:20,730
Shut up!

755
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,103
Get off!

756
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:34,904
- Oh! My leg!
- "Oh, my leg. " Shut up!

757
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,288
Comfy? Good.

758
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:51,890
Come on.

759
01:17:55,037 --> 01:17:57,301
You don't know how to do this!

760
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,099
What is my I.Q.?

761
01:18:01,209 --> 01:18:03,973
- What is my I.Q.?
- 182!

762
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:08,339
One hundred and eighty-two!

763
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:13,115
Do you really think

764
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,881
you could have succeeded without me?

765
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:44,451
I’m gonna wait here for Kilmer.

766
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:48,956
You guys secure the perimeter.
Nothing leaves that building.

767
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:59,822
You know what I learned, Dad?

768
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:07,068
I learned that porphyria

769
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:11,738
is treatable. Yeah.

770
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:14,715
You can't cure it. No, no, no, no.

771
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:18,150
But you can at least treat it!

772
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:23,683
Oh, but you knew that, didn't you?

773
01:19:23,759 --> 01:19:27,195
- Please, Brice, no.
- You knew that

774
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:32,059
and you still locked him away
in the basement.

775
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:35,865
- Son, you have no brother.
- Look at him!

776
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:38,903
God, Dad.

777
01:19:40,675 --> 01:19:42,302
All those years,

778
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:46,137
locked away in a basement.

779
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:52,179
You think that some food
and some freaking board games is enough?

780
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:56,517
I gave you everything you needed.
You were a difficult child to raise!

781
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:59,719
Your son, Dad! Your son!

782
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:03,126
You treated him

783
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,400
like an animal.

784
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:14,233
- Is there anyone else in there with him?
- I don't know.

785
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:18,075
- Does he have any other weapons?
- it all happened too quick, Vash.

786
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:24,243
Tave, threats unknown.
Find out what you can.

787
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:25,650
Copy that.

788
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:39,523
Mabe, you've got company. Lock it down.

789
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:40,829
Truck is going out.

790
01:20:40,902 --> 01:20:44,303
Vash, I see five on the street.
Our friends are back.

791
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:56,306
Mabe, we've got two down at the truck.
The other two are trying to flank.

792
01:21:28,817 --> 01:21:32,253
John, Mabe might have
more than she can handle.

793
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:50,866
- Tave, anything inside?
- Stand by.

794
01:22:04,853 --> 01:22:06,377
Just Billings.

795
01:22:28,643 --> 01:22:32,044
- I don't have a shot. I don't have a shot!
- Bye, bitch.

796
01:22:45,527 --> 01:22:49,019
I count four down, plus a second SUV.
Might have two more.

797
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:51,262
You're lucky it didn't go through. Easy.

798
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:53,860
- Easy.
- it feels like it did.

799
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:55,027
Easy.

800
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:58,702
Yeah, Mabe took one.
She got hit in the vest.

801
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:00,935
Get her back to the truck.

802
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:06,207
Just give me a minute. I’ll be fine.
Oh, Christ, it stings like a bitch.

803
01:23:07,048 --> 01:23:09,016
When was your first job with us?
Remember?

804
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:11,177
You remember your first job? Where was it?

805
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:15,746
Oh, God. Cardiff, Wales.
You were there. You know.

806
01:23:17,759 --> 01:23:19,386
You didn't like me being there.

807
01:23:19,461 --> 01:23:22,624
You didn't like the idea
of having an Irish girl on your team.

808
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:26,664
Yeah. Can you blame me?
All right, easy, easy.

809
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:29,261
I mean, you Irish and all.

810
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:34,135
You never lose your temper.
Just a little tough to get you riled up.

811
01:23:35,243 --> 01:23:36,437
- I know.
- All right.

812
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:38,604
- All right.
- Go back to the truck.

813
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:41,547
- Lock yourself in.
- I want to stay here.

814
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:43,345
Don't come out.

815
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:48,349
Fine.

816
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:54,058
Brice!

817
01:23:54,462 --> 01:23:55,952
Stop, please!

818
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,836
I had no help. No choice.

819
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:10,934
- Where is he?
- Where is who?

820
01:24:11,012 --> 01:24:14,971
- You got a son nobody one knows about?
- No, just Brice.

821
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:19,118
He had a disease. I didn't know what to do.

822
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:22,921
He'd have been laughed at
if I’d have let him out.

823
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:27,655
That basement kept him safe.
I did it for him, not to him.

824
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:30,995
I even gave him personal tutors.

825
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:33,566
He's smart!

826
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:38,830
I did good.

827
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:04,529
"Hickory dickory dock
The mouse ran up the clock

828
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:15,976
"The clock struck one"

829
01:25:23,518 --> 01:25:26,646
"The mouse ran down"

830
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:39,794
That doesn't rhyme.

831
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:48,474
- Come on. We're getting out of here.
- No! We need to take this.

832
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:52,136
- Screw this device. We're leaving.
- No!

833
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,812
Drop your weapon.

834
01:26:09,464 --> 01:26:12,399
Emily, what are you waiting for? Shoot him!

835
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:21,231
You know, I don't care what you're wearing,
that has got to hurt.

836
01:26:23,745 --> 01:26:24,871
You know, Vash,

837
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:28,712
I never did get to answer your question
about a boyfriend.

838
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:42,454
- Let's go see if this thing works.
- Sounds good.

839
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:49,595
Yeah, you're in pain. Come on.

840
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:59,571
- it works three to four feet.
- That's about right.

841
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:03,574
No, I got this. I got it.

842
01:27:03,751 --> 01:27:06,481
Yeah, that's fair
after you shot me three times.

843
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:10,354
She shot you twice, he shot you once.
I haven't shot you yet.

844
01:27:10,825 --> 01:27:14,124
I was a political science major, asshole.
Not a math major.

845
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:15,457
Sit down.

846
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:19,459
I’ve got an FN 5.7 there.
That's armor-piercing.

847
01:27:19,534 --> 01:27:21,399
You'd be dead
if I would've capped your ass.

848
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:23,369
You're gonna wish I was.

849
01:27:28,343 --> 01:27:31,369
You should have let your partner
take my money.

850
01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:34,605
Then we would have been done
with all of this.

851
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:37,646
Is it too late to change my mind?

852
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,649
Yeah, I think it is.

853
01:27:41,522 --> 01:27:43,422
Well, all right, then.

854
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:54,200
Never saw your agenda.

855
01:27:56,471 --> 01:27:59,065
That's fascinating,
because you were the one that taught me

856
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,007
in the personal agenda department, Vash.

857
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:05,507
Emily, I was wrong.

858
01:28:17,992 --> 01:28:23,089
Vash. Did you ever think
that the only way to be truly free

859
01:28:24,699 --> 01:28:26,064
is to die?

860
01:29:03,237 --> 01:29:06,138
Brice, my son. I’m so sorry.

861
01:29:09,577 --> 01:29:11,169
No, no.

862
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:22,455
Emily.

863
01:29:28,062 --> 01:29:29,495
You got him.

864
01:29:30,998 --> 01:29:32,556
Armor-piercing.

865
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:48,077
Tave! We've got a man down! Damn it, Vash.
You broke rule number one.

866
01:29:48,249 --> 01:29:51,446
I didn't take bullet for a client.

867
01:29:57,191 --> 01:29:58,351
John!

868
01:30:28,823 --> 01:30:31,485
I don't know who's the bigger monster.

869
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,525
That freak

870
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:38,759
or the one that created him.

871
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,931
Why'd you do that?

872
01:30:49,544 --> 01:30:52,104
I’m okay. I’ll be okay.

873
01:30:53,147 --> 01:30:57,982
John. Your family.
You got to take care of your family.

874
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:01,450
Robert's got to turn pro.

875
01:31:02,924 --> 01:31:06,223
Yeah, let him play, I know.
I know. He's just a kid.

876
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:07,818
You're right, I’m wrong.

877
01:31:07,895 --> 01:31:11,194
And Mr. Billings, about that wire transfer.

878
01:31:11,265 --> 01:31:15,827
Tave! Mabe! Get in here!
We've got a man down!

879
01:31:21,742 --> 01:31:25,439
Hey, don't you go anywhere. Don't you go.
Don't you go. Don't you go.

880
01:31:25,513 --> 01:31:27,504
Don't you go anywhere.

881
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:01,812
Get down.

882
01:32:04,218 --> 01:32:05,412
We got five.

883
01:32:07,088 --> 01:32:10,990
- Don't get so cocky, you hack.
- Just trying to earn a paycheck.

884
01:32:11,092 --> 01:32:13,083
Hey, you got paid on the last job,
didn't you?

885
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:14,422
Copy that.

886
01:33:13,160 --> 01:43:14,422
