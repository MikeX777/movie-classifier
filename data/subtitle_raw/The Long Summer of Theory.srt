1
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah, there's a
little shade here.

2
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,375
An architectural masterpiece
of urban planning.

3
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,541
Fresh from the drawing board:

4
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,875
the theory of an urban district.

5
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:10,958
Guess they're going
to call this "Europacity."

6
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:14,166
Europe is certainly
deserving of that.

7
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,416
Should I turn it up?

8
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,850
We don't have power anymore.

9
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,730
We need power.

10
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,930
NOTICE OF TERMINATION

11
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,970
Things can't stay as they are.

12
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,010
Things aren't allowed
to stay as they are.

13
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,770
Let's assume the
three of us live here.

14
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,410
We live a makeshift life.

15
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,650
Our bags are always half packed,
we're on the go.

16
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,650
Freedom is important to us. We
have no bonds and don't want any.

17
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,490
- Take care. Good luck!
- Bye!

18
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,970
Hello!

19
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,810
- Hey.
- Hi.

20
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,050
- Give that here.
- Camera.

21
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,890
Our goals are short term.

22
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,570
The main objective
is to make ourselves happy.

23
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,370
The main objective
is to make ourselves happy?

24
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,770
My film's about self-optimized
individuals and collective consciousness.

25
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,490
I wanted to know what you're
aspiring to at the moment.

26
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,770
What is your ideal aim?

27
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:51,530
You mean for my future?

28
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,970
Yes, for your future
but also more generally.

29
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,290
These things prove the arbitrariness
of economic principles.

30
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,250
These shoes were
new and had a price.

31
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,010
They're still new, but the price
is now a fraction of what it was.

32
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,690
All the same, no one wants them.

33
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,410
Is this all without value?

34
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,370
When does it have a value? Right
now it's clearly superfluous.

35
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,690
This is broken and worthless now.

36
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,010
I put it back together and
it's Jeff Koons' "Balloon Dog."

37
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,290
It was once worth 10,000 dollars.

38
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,970
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

39
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,970
Can I give you
10,000 dollars for this?

40
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,410
No, you don't need to pay.
You can just have it.

41
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,810
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,930
Thanks.

43
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,930
- Hello, Mr. Felsch.
- Hello.

44
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:44,210
Mr. Felsch I read your book. It
inspired me to do the film I'm making.

45
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:50,130
I was wondering where we are today. Have
we entered a "long winter of theory"?

46
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,210
Because that combination

47
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:58,890
of theory, reading and political
revolt no longer exists in that way.

48
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,770
Firstly, we have an entirely
different reading culture.

49
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,570
You can really see
that at universities.

50
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,730
- You work at a university.
- I do, that's right.

51
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,610
I teach cultural studies
at Humboldt University.

52
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,250
I believe the people who
were part of the 1968 generation

53
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,010
were, above all
else, gifted readers.

54
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,970
As has been noted repeatedly
that generation itself

55
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,250
didn't really produce very
many high-level theoreticians.

56
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,130
- They...
- That's interesting.

57
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,210
As if one can't read and write
at the same time.

58
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,090
That's sort of the
point I wanted to make.

59
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,370
Lots of figures
from the 1968 political scene

60
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:47,210
read a whole lot and got
books and texts in circulation.

61
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:52,130
Like the founders of little left-wing
publishing houses, such as Merve.

62
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,050
When you look around
universities today

63
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,130
it's actually
virtually the reverse.

64
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,770
That is, we are all
constantly writing something.

65
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,130
People write a lot more
during their studies.

66
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:09,930
Cyberculture has greatly reduced
inhibitions about producing writing.

67
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,690
Without having to go to any fuss
you can get publicity in some form.

68
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,530
There's probably a lot more
resistance with a typewriter.

69
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,130
With a typewriter what
you've written is only on paper,

70
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,210
no one reads it.

71
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,450
There are a lot more ways
to get publicity today.

72
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,890
Peer-to-peer culture encourages
writing. It's very empowering.

73
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,370
You have to wonder if all
that's written is getting read.

74
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,970
Yes, mathematically
that can't be.

75
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,570
So how is it as a historian?

76
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,650
Can you research
the future as well?

77
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:52,290
- Is the future relevant to an historian?
- I think that's a pretty important point.

78
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,610
The long summer of theory,

79
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,250
the reason it was
so long and so hot

80
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,970
was because they were theories that
ventured to predict the future.

81
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,290
The blueprint for
that was Marxism

82
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,410
or the philosophy of history,
which goes back roughly to Hegel.

83
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:13,970
Theories that don't just
describe things in the now

84
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:18,890
but that also make a claim to know
how history will develop going forward

85
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,570
and that always project towards some
objective at the end of history.

86
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,290
I don't think we can go back

87
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,570
to those grand, optimistic

88
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,690
teleological narratives

89
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,090
that tell us what direction
things are heading in,

90
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,370
what direction history is moving,
it's meaning.

91
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,250
Yet, at the same time, I see,

92
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,930
in and outside of universities, things
like the Anthropocene discussion.

93
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:52,770
They show there's obviously
a desire for that again.

94
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:56,730
That after these 20 years
of postmodernism

95
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,090
there's a desire to
return to something,

96
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,770
to develop a theory of history

97
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,530
that can somehow or other give us a
sense of how the story will go on.

98
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,730
I think it's clear
that has resurfaced.

99
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,530
I'll sleep with you.

100
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,530
Yes, I'll sleep with you.

101
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,290
Now that we've been
married for a day.

102
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,250
Yesterday,

103
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,290
on April 29, 1945,
we got married.

104
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,450
My name is now "Eva Hitler."

105
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,090
My hair has turned
brown in the bunker.

106
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,690
Like my old name.

107
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,850
"Eva Braun."

108
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,210
Braun. You have to roll the R,
that's what they did back then.

109
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,010
What kind of a text is it anyway?

110
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,850
I'm no longer pretty.

111
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,130
My powder boxes are empty.

112
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,130
My silk stockings have runs.

113
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,450
Runs.

114
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,530
And tomorrow...

115
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,210
Tomorrow we'll all be dead.

116
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,130
But I'm going to
fuck you before then.

117
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,330
I think that's good.

118
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:56,090
Yeah, I reinterpreted the text.
No one can perform this crap.

119
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,490
- And then?
- "And then" what?

120
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,530
What happened then?

121
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,490
Then another girl
came and she did it.

122
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,010
Bye-bye German Film Award.

123
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:10,290
- You'd have given him a blow job?
- I'd do anything for a lead role.

124
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,770
Besides, let's be honest.

125
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:18,330
What's the deal with humanizing a monster?
Am I supposed to empathize with Eva Braun?

126
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,330
"Sentimental drama
in the FÃ¼hrer's bunker."

127
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,810
Nazis had human emotions too.

128
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,770
Justification of the past is the
new genre with "good Nazis."

129
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,090
Justification of the past?

130
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,890
I have a different theory

131
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:37,610
I think those films are so well-loved
because of the female parts.

132
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,250
Back then women
were still beautiful, seductive,

133
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,730
and, most importantly,
submissive.

134
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,370
You know, that brings back
memories of the good old days,

135
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:52,370
when a man was still a man
and a woman was still a woman.

136
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,530
Frau.

137
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,690
- Frau!
- The woman from bygone days.

138
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,370
At least your part had a name.

139
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,690
Recent movies hardly
ever pass the Bechdel test.

140
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,450
- What test?
- The Bechdel test.

141
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,290
It indicates if a
film is misogynistic.

142
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,530
A film isn't that if it has
at least two female parts.

143
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,730
And they have to talk to each
other about a topic besides men.

144
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:24,410
- What else do you want to talk about?
- Yeah, that's right.

145
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,410
- What else would we talk about?
- That's about it, really.

146
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:35,050
This isn't going to be misogynistic,
but it won't be very kind to men either.

147
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,250
Okay, read it.

148
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,050
"Dear, etc... I find
your movie title,

149
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,410
"The Long Journey
from Collective Consciousness

150
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:48,370
"to Self-Optimized Individual -
We become I..."

151
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,890
- Cumbersome?
- "Romantic.

152
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,090
"You swoon over the past.

153
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,690
"Nostalgia oozes forth
like lukewarm gravy..."

154
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:01,250
If your theory is labeled "romantic"
you can take it to an emotional level.

155
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,930
You have to do that in every
screenplay. It's about identification.

156
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:10,370
This is a total Hollywood independent
film expert speaking, right?

157
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,090
I don't want
a character to identify with.

158
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,770
Why not?

159
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:19,250
It imposes foreign emotions on you
and I don't want to be manipulated.

160
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,250
- I mean I'm really hungry.
- Yes, I'll be there in a sec.

161
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,570
What kind of a
character is Detlef?

162
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,810
Detlef has always been here
in this apartment.

163
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,330
Yeah, when we moved in
he always slept in the bathtub.

164
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,490
- Until we got him the sofa.
- Thanks.

165
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,490
Detlef has seen the
entire recent past.

166
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:47,930
He basically holds 30 years of history
inside him and now he mostly keeps silent.

167
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,610
- So the silent past?
- That's enough for me.

168
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,370
I don't want to sit here later
and have done nothing.

169
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,610
Can you convey
that to the viewer?

170
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:01,570
It's not entertainment.
Nola is making a political film.

171
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,930
- And it's about freedom.
- Freedom sounds a bit romantic, right?

172
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,090
- Replenishments.
- Finally!

173
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,450
Freedom isn't
romantic, it's existential.

174
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:17,410
We'll notice that when it's gone.

175
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,330
Where are your doors?

176
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:24,690
- They were in bad need of refurbishment.
- Yeah, that's right.

177
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,650
Yes, they urgently had to be
fitted with gilded doorknobs.

178
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:32,010
- The hypothesis is: What should we do?
- That's no hypothesis.

179
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,650
Sure, we just have to scream
it out: "What should we do?!"

180
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,490
That's all been done.

181
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:41,890
It's how Baader and Meinhof sat
at the table planning abductions.

182
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:46,010
Nonsense! First they set fire to
a department store in Frankfurt.

183
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:50,250
Yeah, but we're talking
about not reenacting the past.

184
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,930
Not reenacting it
but processing it.

185
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,370
Or as inspiration.

186
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,410
But still the question remains:

187
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,610
What to do?

188
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,090
- Hi.
- Hi.

189
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,930
- Hi.
- Hey.

190
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,730
Is something going
on with you guys?

191
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,730
Nothing at all is going on.

192
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,570
Work, earning a living,

193
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,210
a livelihood.

194
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,890
And we're not any further ahead.

195
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,010
The low-wage sector is still
primarily occupied by women.

196
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,850
More and more so.

197
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,930
A growing number of women
are working in low-wage jobs

198
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,370
like caregiving,

199
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:07,010
cleaning.

200
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,610
And then the neoliberal blather

201
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,050
about how emancipating it is when
a woman can provide for herself.

202
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,090
She has to provide for herself.

203
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:25,250
All that does is provide
capitalism with cheap labor.

204
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,490
And women end up doing
the same jobs as always.

205
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,250
I toil for my independence.
That's a contradiction in terms.

206
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,290
You know what, Nola,

207
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,650
sometimes I'd like
to have it like that too.

208
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:07,290
Someone who helps me put my coat
on, who holds the door open for me

209
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,690
or who escorts me to the table.

210
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,250
And who reads the menu to you.

211
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:17,850
An older man who fumbles to get
his reading glasses out. Oh, Katja!

212
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:22,690
You know what I mean.

213
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:26,370
But, you know,
as long as the tourists come

214
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:31,850
and pay their 25
euros a head per night

215
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,090
and are happy with that
everything's dandy.

216
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,050
At least someone invented
the washing machine.

217
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,770
Yeah, what are we
complaining about?

218
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,570
- I think we should go in for the audio.
- Sounds good.

219
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:25,250
Can you explain
the term "state feminism" to me?

220
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,810
That's the title of our book and
it's actually meant a bit ironically.

221
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,810
About ten years
ago it was a surprise

222
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,410
to see established politicians
turn feminist.

223
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:42,930
They gave passionate speeches about
the importance of women's independence.

224
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,970
Then came a series of reforms.

225
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,530
The parental allowance
was introduced,

226
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:51,130
day care was expanded
and "mini-jobs" were introduced.

227
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:54,850
Ultimately it was clear
that the main aim of that reform

228
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,410
was to get well-educated women
to have lots of kids

229
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:03,290
and to get them to return to work as
quickly as possible after childbirth.

230
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,290
Once you realized
that it's primarily women

231
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,890
who take care
of small children and old people

232
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:16,010
it turned out that it was ultimately
the intensification of a double burden.

233
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,330
As far as we know that has never
been the aim of a feminist movement.

234
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,770
We don't know
anybody who wants that.

235
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,210
So the burden on women
has actually increased

236
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,570
thanks to prevailing ideas
of motherhood?

237
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,330
Yes.

238
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,050
But you can't view
that independently

239
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,690
from the other laws
that have changed as well.

240
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,770
The Hartz IV reforms to unemployment
and social welfare were implemented,

241
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,530
so were mini-jobs
and part-time jobs.

242
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,290
And all those things led to

243
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:54,010
a lot more women
being in employment.

244
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,490
The labor force
participation rate for women

245
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,330
has increased from 2003 to today

246
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,850
to over 70 percent.

247
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:07,050
And back then it was 55 percent.

248
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,250
That's something that
makes you wonder:

249
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,570
How did that happen?

250
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,890
Why has the state discovered
feminism all of a sudden

251
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:22,930
and why do we now have so many
women with children who are working?

252
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,650
So it's really about creating
a more productive society,

253
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,130
about incentives
to make society more productive.

254
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,210
- That's how I see it.
- And to preserve the capitalist system.

255
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,490
- Actually.
- Yes, to preserve it...

256
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,330
- Or even to...
- To optimize it.

257
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,450
Yes, to optimize it.

258
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:48,410
So that... Yes, you really can say
that. What does it mean for society?

259
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:52,530
Well-educated women
who are then supposed to be...

260
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:58,290
After having spent all of 20
years going to school and studying

261
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:03,810
they're supposed to put all their
effort into raising one or two children?

262
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,610
As far as the state's concerned
that's a huge waste,

263
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,090
from a capitalist standpoint
it is as well.

264
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,890
Basically those women
are supposed to continue

265
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:21,050
to make their productivity
available to the market.

266
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:27,010
Nowadays most women have to work. Lots
of women had to do that before too.

267
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,010
But in this day and age
there are more demands.

268
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,290
Women are expected to have
immensely successful careers

269
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,130
while at the same time, and
we haven't yet talked about this,

270
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,570
lofty demands are being put
on mothers and fathers.

271
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,930
You can't just raise
a kid nowadays,

272
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,610
they have to be very gifted
and you have to foster

273
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,650
your children as
much as possible.

274
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,850
I insist upon my
right to laziness.

275
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,730
Like other people insist
upon their right to work.

276
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,730
I've always been
a flop on the job market.

277
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,290
Whatever.

278
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,090
I had a job as a
corpse in the theater.

279
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:17,050
In this play
that was like three hours long.

280
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,690
I died ten minutes into it.

281
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,210
I lay there, me with
my weak bladder.

282
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:28,330
I couldn't hold it anymore
after 40 minutes.

283
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:33,490
And I had to decide if I was going
to pee onstage or go to the toilet.

284
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,810
I chose the toilet.

285
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,570
I got up, went to the toilet,

286
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,770
came back

287
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,090
and lay down in the same place.

288
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,450
No one really noticed.

289
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,530
But the director
totally blew his top.

290
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,930
He was so hot-tempered
he fired me on the spot.

291
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,450
It's absurd, as if anyone
really believed you were dead.

292
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:01,930
- Yeah!
- That's an idea.

293
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,090
Theater with real corpses.

294
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:08,010
Maybe with volunteers who want
to live out their final rush.

295
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,810
Yeah, like GG Allin.

296
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,690
He died in front of his audience.
He did it.

297
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,450
Even as a corpse in a theater

298
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,930
you still have no
right to laziness.

299
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,050
Come on.

300
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,850
You coming?

301
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,450
Hey, come on!

302
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,530
That's good. One, two...

303
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,690
three!

304
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,010
Towards me. That's right.

305
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,050
We're nearly done.

306
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,570
Oh yeah, this is...

307
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:42,770
I don't even know
what his name is.

308
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,810
- Time for a Sexy Lamp Test.
- Oh, you're mean!

309
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,970
We'll take the part out of the script
and replace it with a decorative lamp.

310
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,050
If the story doesn't
change, it's a fail.

311
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,210
Two against one, so...

312
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,650
Man, you guys are so mean!

313
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,850
The guy is really nice,
and a great actor to boot.

314
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,290
- Hello.
- Hello.

315
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,010
Hi. Nice lamp.

316
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,090
- Can we borrow your bike again?
- Yeah.

317
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:23,810
- Do the Chinese guys still need it?
- The Chinese guys don't need a bike.

318
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:26,210
Yes, you can take it.

319
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,650
- Have you found a new apartment?
- Mom says we won't with all the dogs.

320
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:34,730
- What'll you do then?
- Grandma has a yard.

321
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,130
Do we know where
we're going to move yet?

322
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:43,690
"My husband is my home."
That's what my grandma said.

323
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:47,810
I mean, what are we doing here
anyway? I mean in the here and now.

324
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:51,410
Are we different
or are the times different?

325
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,890
We're sitting at a dumb hand-me-down
table with all our old crap.

326
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,250
And all we own is
the cup in our hands.

327
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,810
Wouldn't the situation
be totally different

328
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,610
if we were sitting
in a cozy little garden?

329
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,930
Like in the community
garden Bornholm II?

330
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,770
We're different
people in this situation.

331
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,410
We'd read a Friedrich
Kittler text totally differently.

332
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,410
We may even
interpret it differently,

333
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,050
take the opposing position,
not an affirmative one.

334
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:35,410
I doubt I'd read it at all. These
brats would have me at my wit's end.

335
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,130
The situation could
be totally different.

336
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,130
Imagine it, we're
sitting in the salon

337
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:45,530
of a 200-square-meter pre-WWII
apartment on Pariser Strasse.

338
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,930
The nanny
has already put the brats to bed.

339
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:54,410
Or we didn't have any to begin
with. Right? You not here at all!

340
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:03,250
Wow! I never thought your
imagination was so bourgeois.

341
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:08,210
To be honest I find it pretty
strenuous to keep my bearing all day.

342
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,770
I mean, bearing in what sense?

343
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,210
- Towards what?
- I imagine it being quite fun.

344
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:19,010
You know, when you really get
into it and get a feel for it.

345
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:23,010
But then it'd be the
only life you have.

346
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,490
Thank you.

347
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,490
We could do
something totally normal.

348
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,450
Yes.

349
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:46,730
An occupation we never would've
chosen of our own free will.

350
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:04,530
Right, this is for you.
You can read through it.

351
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,970
Well, if I had to sit here
at my desk every day

352
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:14,210
I think I'd try to find happiness
in the evenings and on weekends.

353
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:18,250
- I think that makes lots of things easier.
- I couldn't do it.

354
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,970
But if I had to

355
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,210
maybe then I could.

356
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:26,250
Maybe you have to have to
to be able to.

357
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:30,450
And then it makes sense
to rebel against all this crap.

358
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,450
You're right about that, everything
here really is total crap.

359
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:39,730
We're going on about parallel
worlds. We could do this forever.

360
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:44,370
Yet it doesn't get us any further
along, and we never go far enough.

361
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:48,090
A coffee picker in Bali,
a seamstress in Bangladesh,

362
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,850
we jump from one
extreme to the other.

363
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:55,210
The more extreme we get
the more we neutralize ourselves.

364
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,650
Neutralize?

365
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,610
Yeah.

366
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,370
We always revert
to being ourselves.

367
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,490
Yeah.

368
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,130
Damn!

369
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:10,890
Yeah, you have
to position yourself.

370
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,410
To find a position.

371
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:19,650
But within or without?

372
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:26,530
Do I think from the inside out or
do I see myself from the outside?

373
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,570
I would actually
rather do the latter.

374
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,770
But I fear there is
no "outside" anymore.

375
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:39,290
The individual has greedily
absorbed that within.

376
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,930
But what you dream
of, or what you mean,

377
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:45,610
is that everyone is outside.

378
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:50,290
That no one follows
any rules or any laws anymore.

379
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,530
And that brings us back
to the Red Army Faction.

380
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,290
No, that's baloney.

381
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:59,650
Even if I were allowed to break laws I
don't know which laws I'd want to break,

382
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:01,810
let alone demolish.

383
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:06,490
I can think of one or two things
that one could demolish.

384
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,930
Yes, you as an individualist.

385
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,690
But, in all honesty,

386
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,810
we're all totally sedated

387
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,930
and stupefied
with little gifts and rewards.

388
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:25,810
And no one voluntarily demolishes
their little reward.

389
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,810
That's a primal instinct.

390
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:32,330
Sure, but I'm not even that far
along. It's not relevant to me.

391
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:36,410
Right now I don't have any
possessions that I could defend.

392
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:43,250
All right then, I'll explain
the entry area to you now.

393
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:50,250
As you can see it's a prestigious
space, gloriously awash in light.

394
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:55,330
You could call this room
the centerpiece of the apartment.

395
00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:00,130
Look how the wonderful features of
this old structure are brought to bear.

396
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,690
- Cool, eh?
- That's right, I want to hear a "whoop!"

397
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,650
Yes, now I'll show
you the bathroom units.

398
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:16,730
You can have them converted and made into
a designer bath and sanitary facilities.

399
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,770
- Hello, Ms. Jaeggi.
- Hello, Nola.

400
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:15,570
How do you define
the term "forms of life"?

401
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:19,050
I'll tell you the formula
and then explain it.

402
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:24,730
They are something akin to inert bundles
or ensembles of social practices.

403
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:29,290
That alludes to some things that
are key to the term "forms of life."

404
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:32,090
One is that they
are social practices,

405
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:37,370
things that people do and that they
do with certain behavioral patterns

406
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:41,570
that are social in that they are
socially shaped and defined.

407
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:47,730
When discussing forms of life people
argue about what practices to include.

408
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:53,210
Is a family still a family if the members
no longer talk or eat dinner together?

409
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,570
- Lots of fighting.
- Interesting.

410
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:58,890
Is it a city
if it no longer has public places

411
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:04,410
where people can meet up without
making a date and without paying?

412
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,490
You could say that
contradicts the idea of a city,

413
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:11,930
or of how we construe the city as a
form of life if such spots are gone.

414
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:16,050
In the film we dream ourselves
away into other scenarios.

415
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:21,250
So we're actually a little bit
weary of our existing form of life,

416
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,250
or of existence in general.

417
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,770
So we dream about how it would be
if we had a bourgeois family

418
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:32,690
or if we had jobs that didn't
allow us so much time to think,

419
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,450
jobs that are a lot
more structured.

420
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,770
But in the end we realize

421
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:42,970
no matter where we dream ourselves away
to we always revert back to ourselves.

422
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,490
What do you think about that?

423
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,890
I mean, would that change me?

424
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:52,730
Or, what does a form of life
do with me, as an individual?

425
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:57,570
The idea that I as an individual am
here and the form or life is here,

426
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,810
like it's some kind of armor
that you slip into,

427
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:05,970
or as if your form or life were some
kind of a cabin that you walk into

428
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,130
but can also walk back out of
and be yourself.

429
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:13,090
Yes, that is not
the notion that I...

430
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,290
That isn't the notion
that guides me or that...

431
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:21,810
I don't assume that,
I basically assume that you...

432
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:27,210
I assume that getting out of that
socially determined behavioral...

433
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:31,210
What I mean is that you
can't escape interpretations

434
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:34,290
of how you see your
life and what you are.

435
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:37,490
That is, you can't
just step out of them.

436
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:43,010
When you step out of them you're
still referring back to them.

437
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,330
- A good way to explain that may be...
- There is no neutral space?

438
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,050
- Exactly.
- I'm always in a form of life.

439
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,970
I can't step out into a vacuum
with no form of life

440
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,930
and step into a new one.

441
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,210
But you can still consciously
plan collective forms of life.

442
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:05,610
Artists living together precariously is
a conscious attempt at a form of life.

443
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:08,410
One could call
that a form of life

444
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:11,650
that takes the fluid
or the transitional...

445
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:15,490
It institutionalizes
the transitional phase.

446
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:21,250
We were talking about our lack of
bonds, which we actually quite like.

447
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:26,970
I wanted jump to the way the New Right
interprets what it means to have no bonds.

448
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:32,490
It sees reviving ties to family and
homeland as the way to save humanity.

449
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:37,570
So they basically see a lack of
bonds as the plague of humanity.

450
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:39,650
How do you see that?

451
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:44,610
Something like that quite crude
notion of homeland and family,

452
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:48,970
the idea of something you're born
into that is steadfast and undying,

453
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:54,410
is something that is meant to give us the
guidance we are all allegedly missing.

454
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:59,330
I think that is a very, very
disastrous interpretation

455
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:03,690
and a very disastrous diagnosis
that seems to cover a lot of things.

456
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:07,490
It's why the New Right
call themselves "identitarians."

457
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,090
I think it's important to realize

458
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:15,610
that a lack of relationships, an
indifference towards the world,

459
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:18,130
oneself and others
is a real problem.

460
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:20,770
But that cannot be correlated

461
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,490
to pre-existing,
given and developed

462
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:27,730
identities and ideas of homeland.

463
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:31,050
My assumption is
actually the opposite.

464
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,770
I believe that overemphasis, or
that emphasis on what is given,

465
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:39,770
the emphasis on homeland and
traditional family structures,

466
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,610
is something that
has to do with the fact

467
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:47,610
that people feel powerless in
the circumstances they live in.

468
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,690
- That they can't shape them...
- Out of fear?

469
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,650
Yes, it's a...

470
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:56,010
- A realization of impracticability.
- Yes.

471
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:07,370
That's just how we grew up.

472
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:11,450
Politics are for politicians
and we, we do something else.

473
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,770
It's established,
like the division of labor.

474
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:18,090
If we're political at all
then we're the opposition.

475
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:22,250
That's not really true anymore.
We were the opposition.

476
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:27,890
Now Pegida, the AfD, right-wingers
and identitarians are the opposition.

477
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,050
So now we're
the opposition to the opposition.

478
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,650
Or we...

479
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:38,210
Or we work hand-in-hand
with politicians.

480
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,370
With the government.

481
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,410
A cabinet of horrors.

482
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:46,930
But we want to be the opposition,
that's our role.

483
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:51,650
Oh, guys, opposition aside.
Don't we want to do something?

484
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,730
Make political films
or films in general?

485
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:01,650
I've seen quite a few political films
that were just political thrillers.

486
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:05,450
They were about big names
and big-time topics.

487
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:11,290
I'm definitely going to revolt.
The only question is when?

488
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:16,690
Whether I'll do it before or
after the Nazis have seized power.

489
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,090
Somehow we have to create
entirely new structures.

490
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,970
To reinvent politics.

491
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,730
Like reinventing the wheel.

492
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:33,930
We have to start there,
by creating a new -ismus.

493
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:37,810
- One that doesn't exist yet.
- Yeah, and what should it be?

494
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,490
Empathism, perhaps.

495
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:43,410
What's that supposed
to be? Rousseau?

496
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:46,250
Should we start over
from the beginning?

497
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,810
Empathy as a value
anchored in the legal framework.

498
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:55,290
Not before I've pushed through the right
to earn money with your eyes closed.

499
00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:00,130
Am I the only pragmatic person
in this room or what?

500
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:05,010
It's not like the refrigerator
fills up overnight on its own.

501
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:08,970
Well, in a certain
sense it does do that.

502
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:12,610
Really? How does a
refrigerator fill itself?

503
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:18,090
Well, Katja managed to crack the lock
to an empty apartment in this building

504
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:20,930
and to use it as a
nice Airbnb lodging.

505
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:25,730
- In order to feed the family.
- Let's move beyond the food issue.

506
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,730
We really should
open up our eyes.

507
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,650
Do we really want to see this?

508
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:37,530
It is high treason
against the German people.

509
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:41,410
We categorically say no
to expanding immigration

510
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,210
to allow third-country nationals.

511
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:48,450
It would overstrain our
country's integration capacity.

512
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,130
Lying press!

513
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,810
Lying press!

514
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,570
Lying press!

515
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:58,210
What does the German oak care

516
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:01,290
if a warthog rubs against it?

517
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:05,410
So you'll eventually only get
stale bread and water.

518
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,490
Because that's
what is just for you.

519
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:10,210
Deport!

520
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,730
Deport! Deport!

521
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:30,610
- I'm going to make an announcement.
- Yeah?

522
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,770
Listen here, everyone.

523
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,010
Zip them!

524
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:40,050
As you know this is
our last Wednesday dinner.

525
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,010
We're going to be thrown out
in three days.

526
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:47,370
Today we sit together, then we
party and then it's over and done.

527
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,890
So I propose that we all
raise our glasses again.

528
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:57,530
- To a new start.
- Did someone ring?

529
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:04,250
What's that?

530
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,330
- What is that?
- An ulcer remedy.

531
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,730
Do you have an ulcer
or do you mean us?

532
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,290
Oh, come on.

533
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,650
- Hassan.
- That's a bit mean.

534
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:19,330
- What's he doing over there?
- Dishes.

535
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:24,130
- Boy, you guys suck.
- Hey, have a burger to add to your halo.

536
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:26,050
He's an actor, like we are.

537
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:30,250
But he fell out with all the
directors and his agency dumped him.

538
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:33,130
Yeah, and so we
help him with his rent.

539
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:36,410
He wants to work for it,
so he does dishes.

540
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,850
I saw you on TV
playing a Lebanese drug boss.

541
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,370
Na, dude, don't start.

542
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:52,530
I'm done with those roles.
Screw stereotypes!

543
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,690
I want to play normal people.

544
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:58,450
We work, we've been living
here for years. What the hell!

545
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:05,010
Then play yourself, write your
dialogs. I have a low-budget project.

546
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,930
- What do you say?
- With deferred payment?

547
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:12,130
- No, I said low-budget, not no-budget.
- Oh, okay.

548
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:16,010
Dog, don't get me wrong. I have
to do my job. I get a set rate.

549
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:20,050
- I got you.
- My hourly wage drops the longer we talk.

550
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,850
- Okay.
- That's straight talk.

551
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:29,970
The art crisis.

552
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:36,330
The real question is: Does
art always have to be unpaid?

553
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:41,290
It's more that we differentiate.
We say "no-budget" is art.

554
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:43,970
If something's
paid it's commercial.

555
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:48,970
- It's either-or, that causes poverty.
- I make art and my punishment is no money.

556
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:52,730
For me making loads of dough
doing it would be a disaster.

557
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,410
I don't think he wants that
either, that's why he's here.

558
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:00,530
So you don't want to be whores,
but what if you love your clients?

559
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:05,290
If you made really awesome money
doing things that you love?

560
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:06,890
Paradise.

561
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:11,770
Yeah, but the market is made up of
people and people desire things.

562
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:16,010
Do you think people really desire
what they see? Or that it...

563
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,930
- I'd say audiences, the masses...
- Bye.

564
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,610
Bye.

565
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:22,850
They watch what's shown to them.

566
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:28,850
The problem we're facing right now is
that critical art is what's in demand.

567
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,490
I don't need money, just burgers.

568
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:14,810
22/6, first take.

569
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,730
Clapper.

570
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:19,610
Go ahead.

571
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,610
- Hello, Mr. Hegemann.
- Hello.

572
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:26,330
Nice to see you.
We are now here...

573
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:34,490
What if a movie didn't create an
illusion? Would that not be cinema?

574
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:38,490
When making art in general
and when making political art

575
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:42,770
you have no choice but to
peek at what's behind the faÃ§ade.

576
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:47,850
And no matter how bad it is you
have to concern yourself with it.

577
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,450
That would be a
kind of enlightenment.

578
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:53,850
But you have to be fully aware
that the audience

579
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:56,970
always feels it has
been duped then,

580
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:00,650
because audiences go to
the cinema for that illusion.

581
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:04,530
But a film that employs
those mechanisms of illusion

582
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:09,370
to present a successful revolution
or a strong socially critical plot

583
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:14,010
without breaking the illusion is
perhaps not all that political.

584
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:17,730
- According to Brecht...
- Then it's more manipulative?

585
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:19,410
Yes.

586
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:22,130
It's probably without effect.

587
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:27,290
You watch it, are moved and maybe
you shed a tear and that's that.

588
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:31,290
Brecht said people
are lulled into the illusion

589
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:34,290
and no longer construe
the world as alterable.

590
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:39,530
You can only construe it is as alterable
when you free yourself from the illusion.

591
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:45,130
That doesn't exist anywhere else,
it only exists on this stage.

592
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:50,890
That a grown person can claim they
are the King of Denmark or similar.

593
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:53,770
And that is interesting,

594
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:58,570
because if you were to do that in
real life, if you were to dress up...

595
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:02,290
That great suit you're wearing
is borderline.

596
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:04,530
- It's almost a costume.
- Yeah.

597
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:09,090
- If you walk around in that...
- I get stared at walking around the city.

598
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:11,730
As Hamlet I'd probably be...

599
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:15,050
If I said I was Hamlet
I'd be put in a psychiatric ward.

600
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:18,650
Or if you were to put on a tie
and stick a moustache on

601
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:20,610
and claim to be a man.

602
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:25,090
Wearing a glued on moustache in
the theater is no problem at all.

603
00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:29,730
People believe it, people accept
that kind of mixing of identities.

604
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:35,250
But mixing up life with a theater
stage, that can be really dangerous.

605
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:40,250
It is simply extremely liberating
when you can say what you think.

606
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:43,210
A colleague
who is your age recently told me

607
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:46,610
she didn't know anyone
among her acquaintances

608
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:49,090
who still says what they think.

609
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,930
People can't afford
to do that anymore.

610
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:55,570
But what kind of a society,
what kind of life is it

611
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:59,330
when you only ever say what's
suitable in a given moment

612
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:01,690
and the other
person does that too?

613
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:04,450
Then you live in a
totally illusory world,

614
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:09,850
then the theater of social roles
is truly detached from the people.

615
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:14,330
- And that's why it's so liberating and...
- Then we're all zombies.

616
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:18,850
We can say that this stage is
exemplary because people here,

617
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:24,210
where others stay objective and cool
when they try to lodge a tiny objection,

618
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:27,770
people here yell, that's
why there's so much yelling.

619
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:33,770
That's because here people can use their
voice to express authentic thoughts.

620
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:39,370
And that truth and seriousness, you
really can't act as if it were so.

621
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:43,930
It seems you can only do that onstage,
where it's not forbidden to yell.

622
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,730
In my script it says
we ride Bobby Cars now.

623
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:48,730
If it say so, we have to do it.

624
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:51,890
I doubt it's conducive
to self-optimization.

625
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:10,610
- This is chic too.
- I think it makes you look old somehow.

626
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,450
- The fur, not you.
- Um-hm.

627
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:17,410
Yeah. Or maybe
a two-piece outfit...

628
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,570
"This rapidly changing city

629
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:24,050
"that made its flaw of a lack of
tradition into a sign of modernity."

630
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:27,730
That sounds like it
could be from now.

631
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:30,650
But it was written
by Robert Walser in 1908.

632
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:33,690
"Makeshift
existence suits Berlin,

633
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:38,050
"where people are eager for anything
new, quickly pass over yesterday

634
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:40,410
"and nothing stays as it was."

635
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,690
That's still true today too.

636
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:57,930
"To Robert Walser Berlin is a body,
a dream populated by Berlin's women.

637
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:02,210
"He wants them all, the
naive, voluptuous violent lady

638
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:05,490
"and the good little girl
from KurfÃ¼rstendamm."

639
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:08,010
- Button it up, right?
- Yeah.

640
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:10,330
"Berlin is a giant lady.

641
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:26,210
"Contemporaries continually stress
the analogy of Berlin and its women

642
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:28,890
"Robert Musil, Carl Zuckmayer...

643
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:31,650
"These quotes have

644
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:35,530
"a striking mix of incredulous
adulation, erotic attraction

645
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:40,410
"and restrained aggression that they
use to describe the city and its women."

646
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,450
This is still the 1920s.

647
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:48,410
"The spry and firm big-city girls

648
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:51,610
"with their insatiable
open mouths grow annoyed

649
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:55,130
"when my eyes settle too long

650
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:57,210
"and floating cheeks."

651
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:02,370
A certain Franz Hessel.

652
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:17,570
More "Berlin as woman."

653
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,370
"The 'rubble woman.'

654
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:23,890
"Youthful beauty contrasts
with the rubble she sorts.

655
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:29,770
"In the mid-1980s Helmut Newton shot
his 'boardinghouse photos' in Berlin."

656
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:33,010
That sounds good.
"FrÃ¤ulein Petra."

657
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:01,850
"Ten years later, JÃ¼rgen Teller.

"Cloudy puddles, rusty iron doors,

664
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:30,890
Heroin chic?

665
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:32,890
Me again.

00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:53,410
"In Berlin he seeks phenomena that
open themselves up to narratives.

669
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:58,650
"The girl in the sweater
with HÃ¶lderlin in her pocket,

670
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:01,490
"as Harold Nicholsen
described in 1929,

671
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:04,330
"had become a junkie after 1961."

672
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:09,410
I'm the girl in the sweater. I
have HÃ¶lderlin in my pocket too.

673
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,450
The City and Its Bodies.

674
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,250
The City of Women.

675
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:31,770
No, that was another film.

676
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:38,130
And behind that faÃ§ade
lurks an immense void.

677
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:11,850
- Hello, Ms. Allmendinger.
- Hello, Nola.

678
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:16,010
I interviewed students for my
film and what stood out to me

679
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:20,650
was most of them answered the questions
in relation to their own futures

680
00:55:20,810 --> 00:55:24,090
but never in the context
of society as a whole.

681
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:28,290
And I was wondering if it was
due to my questioning technique

682
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,930
that it always went in
that individualistic direction.

683
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:35,330
People naturally start
talking about themselves.

684
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:39,010
We know that, and so we
have to resort to measures

685
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:43,370
to make them move on to talking
about society of their own accord,

686
00:55:43,530 --> 00:55:48,970
or to get them to extrapolate from
themselves to their social circle

687
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:52,410
or to what they think
about society and the world.

688
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:57,210
So you can of course do that by
sitting in a bar for a long time

689
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,090
drinking beer with them

690
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:03,290
and you'll get that in what
we call a "narrative interview."

691
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:07,570
But you don't get anything
representative with that.

692
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:10,850
We start with just what
you were criticizing.

693
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:13,770
We want people
focused on themselves,

694
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:16,130
so they notice how they feel.

695
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:19,610
And that they begin
with themselves alone.

696
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:23,570
And we do that
by trying to shut down cognition.

697
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:25,530
They shouldn't think.

698
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:29,890
And then we give them these
surfaces. This is a kind of mat.

699
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:34,090
This is rough, this is glass,
this is corrugated cardboard.

700
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:38,010
- And we say...
- And it works. You immediately...

701
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:42,210
- You feel...
- We ask, "How does your life feel today?

702
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:45,210
- "Just tell me how life feels today."
- Yeah.

703
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:49,810
What the media tells them, what they
read in books is immediately gone.

704
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:52,570
Think about how your life feels.

705
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:56,610
You can do it differently.
I can have you smell this.

706
00:56:57,210 --> 00:57:00,010
How does your
life smell? Like this?

707
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:02,330
Or does life smell like this?

708
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:07,610
And voilÃ ! You forget what
people have been telling you.

709
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:10,730
We don't want that.
We can read that in the paper.

710
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:13,130
We're interested in your opinion.

711
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:17,250
When we have them at a point
where they've attained inner peace

712
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:20,490
and have forgotten all else,
then we get started.

713
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:24,690
Then we ask, "How important is
a feeling of togetherness to you?

714
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:27,210
"How important is that to you?"

715
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:31,770
And then you can answer that
question on that very pure level.

716
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:36,810
Those are preliminary questions,
then we move on to the real ones.

717
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:40,410
What do you desire
for the coming generation?

718
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:44,210
What do you wish to pass on to
your kids? What'd be your legacy?

719
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:49,370
We've already moved a step from a
focus on "me" to a focus on society.

720
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:53,130
And then if we then
take a third step and ask,

721
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:57,050
"And what do you think?
How will society actually be?"

722
00:57:57,250 --> 00:58:00,250
Those steps get us
something utterly different

723
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:03,330
than going right to
that third level does.

724
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:07,970
You're absolutely right, then people
stay in their own little lives.

725
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:15,730
If you were given carte blanche what
would you change in our society?

726
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:20,450
What we see is that income is important
and, of course, so is education.

727
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:22,970
There's no doubt about that.

728
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:26,570
But when we consider
which people have visions,

729
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:31,450
which people see life as an opportunity
to shape the things around them

730
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:34,130
and see life as worth shaping.

731
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:38,090
Increasingly those are people
with true circles of friends.

732
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:41,690
And not lots of friends
who are all from the same place,

733
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:44,250
as was once perhaps
the case for me,

734
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:50,250
but friends from different countries
and from a diverse array of backgrounds.

735
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:53,570
People of varying ages
and sexual orientations.

736
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:56,210
And that can be facilitated.

737
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:59,770
That's something I think
society does less and less.

738
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:06,370
We've noticed that those various groups
are increasingly staying among themselves.

739
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:11,610
And so what I would recommend
is a mandatory social year.

740
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:14,890
That there's a kind of
mandatory exchange

741
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:17,450
with people in other countries.

742
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:21,250
We have to introduce people,
young people, to that

743
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:25,930
so that we don't stay in one little
spot in Germany our entire lives.

744
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:30,410
So we want to open up and have
to open up to the wider world.

745
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:34,090
You can't force that on people,
they have to want it.

746
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:39,530
And the will to do that comes with
one-to-one contact, with experience.

747
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:41,850
People with a broader focus?

748
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:46,130
Pessimistic people say, "The
feeling of togetherness is lovely,

749
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:48,330
"but it's going down the drain."

750
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:53,370
Those are people who haven't
experienced a feeling of otherness.

751
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:56,010
- Yes.
- Yet you can create that.

752
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:59,650
You can do that politically,
socially with incentives

753
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:01,930
and by supporting that.

754
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:06,650
To create the possibility of having
those diverse social contacts.

755
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:10,250
Not by doing the opposite
with urban planning,

756
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:14,410
that is, keeping people among
their own, in their own schools.

757
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:18,690
Or, on the other hand, by having
schools that are so diverse

758
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:21,330
that there's no longer
a common thread.

759
01:00:22,130 --> 01:00:23,890
Thank you so much.

760
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:43,730
We're waiting for one
little screw then it's done.

761
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:47,490
It looks pretty good already.

762
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:22,610
Nola.

763
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:26,410
- How's your film coming along?
- Nearly done.

764
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:31,210
- I just need a really good final scene.
- Do you already have a resolution?

765
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:33,650
I'm not deluding myself.

766
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:37,690
My film won't change the world
or kick-start a revolt.

767
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:40,410
It's more of a stocktaking.

768
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:44,650
I asked questions and everyone
has to find their own answers.

769
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:51,730
I'm going.

770
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:06,810
A package for Pit.

771
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:10,010
So? Sexy lamp?

772
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:58,970
"You can't do a thing
there anymore," so they said

773
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:03,290
It's like a museum,
all it does is look good

774
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:07,250
And that's why we're moving on

775
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:09,570
To shut down the next city

776
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:11,570
Ownership

777
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:16,210
Our ownership

778
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:20,730
Own

779
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:23,530
Own and everything

780
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:25,410
Ownership

781
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:28,370
Our own and everything

782
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:50,250
- Hello, Mr. Groys.
- Hello.

783
01:04:50,410 --> 01:04:52,930
- Nice to see you.
- I'm glad you're here.

784
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:56,290
We've chosen
this very futuristic location.

785
01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:59,210
Do you feel
like you're in the future here?

786
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:03,810
Yes, perhaps, inasmuch
as this place reminds me of

787
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:08,130
how I imagined the future
when I was a child.

788
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:11,970
When I read books and saw movies

789
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:14,730
this is more or less
how I imagined it.

790
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:17,330
It seems to me that for a period,

791
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:20,850
in the 19th century,
at the start of the 20th century

792
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:23,490
and into the 1960s and 1970s,

793
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:26,690
people still thought
a lot about the future.

794
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:31,530
And people had the feeling
that they could shape the future.

795
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:37,850
That you could push a project through,
develop a vision, so to speak,

796
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:39,730
and then realize it.

797
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:44,250
There was this idea
of a sort of human omnipotence.

798
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:46,490
But now, more and more,

799
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:49,850
the future is becoming
an event to us.

800
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:51,930
An event

801
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:54,210
that's new to us.

802
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:56,690
We're not really prepared.

803
01:05:56,850 --> 01:06:00,530
It often comes as
something unexpected.

804
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:05,450
And we have the feeling
that we should constantly adapt.

805
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:09,050
I believe that our
strategic behavior

806
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:13,530
has increasingly become a strategy
of adapting to the future.

807
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:17,650
I sometimes call
that "self-updating."

808
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:20,330
In one of your texts

809
01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:23,130
you talk about film and say

810
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:27,970
film contains a paradox between
vita contemplativa and vita activa.

811
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:31,090
That screen heroes
are hyperactive.

812
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:33,770
They shoot, they jump,

813
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:36,570
they have to achieve heroic aims,

814
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:40,290
and the viewer
automatically becomes passive

815
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:44,450
because he or she sits statically
in a chair in a theater seat.

816
01:06:45,770 --> 01:06:50,610
How can you become capable of
acting in the face of that paradox?

817
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:54,330
Or how can you induce
the viewer to become active?

818
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:57,090
By getting the viewer

819
01:06:57,290 --> 01:07:02,650
to internally identify with
the movie's heroic character.

820
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:06,850
What you described
as internal movement of thought?

821
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:08,970
- Not movement of thought.
- No?

822
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:10,330
No.

823
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:13,290
Neither the hero can think...

824
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:16,690
- The hero can't think?
- He can't think.

825
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:20,930
The hero has to act heroically.

826
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:25,050
And when you act heroically
you don't think.

827
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:28,930
And the viewer
isn't supposed to think either.

828
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:32,490
The thinking viewer
was a big mistake of Brecht's.

829
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:34,850
The viewer should identify...

830
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:38,250
The viewer should
identify with the movie.

831
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:41,810
The viewer should
identify with the hero.

832
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:45,930
And if that hero
is a revolutionary

833
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:52,090
the viewer will try to adopt the
same position, the same attitude.

834
01:07:52,850 --> 01:07:56,530
But via identification,
Brecht was anti-identification.

835
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:59,250
Yes, but I'd say
via identification.

836
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:00,890
Ultimately...

837
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:04,610
you have to...

838
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:07,610
You become revolutionary

839
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:12,410
when you feel like you're
in a movie in real life.

840
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:16,130
- Yeah?
- That's the premise. You have to...

841
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:18,850
- Like you're in a movie in real life?
- Yes.

842
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:20,690
Or like you're in a novel.

843
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:24,930
The true revolutionary is
romantic. What does that mean?

844
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:27,570
It means life is
like a novel to him.

845
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:30,410
If, just for a moment,

846
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:34,970
he crashed back down
into reality, so to speak,

847
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:39,010
then the revolution
and the romanticism is over.

848
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:44,090
That means that only
as long as I live in that...

849
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:49,530
Only as long as I live in
that totally artificial reality,

850
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:53,970
which is more real
to me than any reality,

851
01:08:54,570 --> 01:08:57,210
am I capable of
inciting a revolution.

852
01:08:57,370 --> 01:09:00,330
The moment that reality becomes

853
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:03,410
a kind of quotidian misery...

854
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:06,930
When I perceive reality
as quotidian misery

855
01:09:07,090 --> 01:09:12,250
- When I surrender to that misery.
- Yeah, then I just want to go to sleep.

856
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:15,970
That is, and everyone said this,

857
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:18,210
Mayakovsky and others said it.

858
01:09:18,650 --> 01:09:23,050
The daily grind destroys revolution,
the misery of the everyday.

859
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:27,010
- But still...
- The boredom.

860
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:31,610
The boredom of life.
Life is fundamentally boring.

861
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:33,250
Fundamentally.

862
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:37,210
And you can't have any kind
of revolution against boredom.

863
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:30,490
Disgust and luxury.

864
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:33,930
Luxury and disgust,
shell and content.

865
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:39,010
You throw concepts into the ring
that go beyond the world of shopping

866
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:41,690
and refer to capitalist society.

867
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:45,370
It's the bland, dull husk
that luxury leaves behind

868
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:48,250
when the expensive
veneer is peeled away.

869
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:51,250
It's immanent, and
thus wickedly genuine.

870
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:56,370
The luxury item in the glossy bag
turns into a monster.

871
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:58,050
Money is of no use.

872
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:02,890
An illness that can't be cured with
all the plastic surgery in the world.

873
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,730
Yes.

874
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:08,290
Ms. SchÃ¶ne-Radunski.

875
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:11,570
Marvelous name, by the way.

876
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:14,210
Yes, you have huge potential.

877
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:18,530
Debunking the hype machine behind
the linking of fashion and art

878
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:21,890
in a clever and
rebellious manner.

879
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:27,130
You really make
me feel pissed off,

880
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:30,850
and like I genuinely don't want
to play along with this.

881
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:35,370
Which is all the more attractive.
What I can't have is all the sexier.

882
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:39,850
That type of thing
can escalate into an obsession.

883
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:48,450
You know what I think of all the
pseudo-rebellious young women

884
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:52,250
who walk in like sluts
and do totally conformist art.

885
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:55,250
That's where things
come full circle.

886
01:11:55,410 --> 01:12:00,290
Those drug-addict role models have to
be the faces of those luxury brands.

887
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:05,610
I could really imagine something
with you, marketing you.

888
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:07,730
We'll stage your art in public,

889
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:11,930
crash cultural events, disrupt,
we'll be all over the media.

890
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:15,450
No, you know what?

891
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:18,290
Screw that.

892
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:02,890
Right.

893
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:07,730
We'll shoot this
without cuts, okay?

894
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:12,730
Right.

895
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:16,290
Just read them aloud
one after the other.

896
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:23,050
What is this? Improvisation?

897
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:27,730
Please start.

898
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:29,770
I'll start.

899
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:34,210
I won't say anything about this
cart as a container for goods.

900
01:13:34,970 --> 01:13:37,090
That would be too obvious.

901
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:40,610
It's about the value of things.

902
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:43,370
I just bought this
thing for a euro.

903
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:46,490
Are you stupid? I
had a plastic token.

904
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:52,850
Think about what it cost. It must've
cost 200 or 300 euros to make.

905
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:55,490
And who pays for that?

906
01:13:57,130 --> 01:13:58,770
The supermarket?

907
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:04,930
Initially, yes, but the supermarket
has you, the shopper, pay for it.

908
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:08,450
Yeah, exactly.
It's like a truck toll.

909
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:11,650
Huh.

910
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:15,890
- Huh?
- Or like paying taxes.

911
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:19,290
Yes, it's paid for by
the general public.

912
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:22,930
Uh-huh, but who does it
belong to? The supermarket?

913
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:25,690
Me, because I put a euro in it.

914
01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:29,650
No, you're the holder
but not the proprietor.

915
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:34,290
Come on, let's not get
into terminologies again.

916
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:38,730
Yeah, the thing about taxes
is much more interesting.

917
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:43,010
Huh? Why are taxes interesting?

918
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:47,570
He means the general public, the
general public needs such things.

919
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:52,370
The question remains whether this
thing is ours because we paid for it.

920
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:56,130
If it is ours then we want to
have a say in what happens to it.

921
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:58,010
Yes, that's right.

922
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:04,770
Exactly, we'd better go get the drinks
with it or we won't get anywhere.

923
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:07,570
End of scene.

924
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:09,450
That's written here.

925
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:37,530
Welcome!

926
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:40,290
When do you have to go?
Where will you go?

927
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:43,250
I think they're putting
a fitness studio in here.

928
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:53,370
There can never be enough love.

929
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:56,050
We need loads
of love in politics.

930
01:15:57,810 --> 01:16:03,610
I was thinking about all the empty vaults
in cemeteries that no one looks after.

931
01:16:03,770 --> 01:16:05,930
You could make
hostels out of them.

932
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:08,930
That's funny,
I was thinking that yesterday.

933
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:10,330
Really?

934
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:13,250
I'd like to live in
a public space.

935
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:16,850
- A public space?
- Yeah, the circle line.

936
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:21,290
A theoretician called that
"depopulation." I think it's a good term.

937
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:24,410
The zombie city!

938
01:16:24,570 --> 01:16:28,850
If you have love inside you
because you know how it feels

939
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:30,850
theoretically you can...

940
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:33,530
But we can't afford
romanticism anymore.

941
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:36,890
I think we need empathetic
politics, that'd be key.

942
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:40,890
I recently saw a couple
having sex on a public subway.

943
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:45,010
That's private. Sex in
the subway is privatization.

944
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:47,410
But isn't that just the problem?

945
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:51,650
Like the Internet, where
everyone writes their beliefs

946
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:54,010
and makes a public space private.

947
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:56,610
It's not a belief
it's sexual relief.

948
01:16:57,210 --> 01:16:59,890
Can't anyone write
that kind of love poem now?

949
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:12,450
Lots of people think
people don't work anymore

950
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:14,610
but I think that people would...

951
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:16,970
Where's the incentive?

952
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:39,490
We're flying!

953
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:42,010
We're flying right out of here!

954
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:50,890
Bye!
