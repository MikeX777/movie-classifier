1
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,494
SCRATCH

2
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,290
Why don't you just shut your gob?

3
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,094
I know what's best for me.

4
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,894
You're fucking up my life.

5
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,254
What's best for you, Mille?

6
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,099
What kind of
fucking question is that?

7
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,092
Mille?

8
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,898
Mille?

9
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,300
What's up?

10
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,253
It's just Jette.
She's got no idea.

11
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,173
Fuck her.
She ought to keep her nose out.

12
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,215
We've got to get away from here.
- What if you can't find anywhere?

13
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,888
I will.
I'm not staying here.

14
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,858
I want to live with you.

15
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,817
This place is for losers.

16
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,132
Hi.

17
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,057
Hi, Sami.
I'm Claus.

18
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,810
Why can't I shack up with you?

19
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,456
We've talked about
that a thousand times.

20
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,975
You've ignored me ever since
you moved in with that bitch.

21
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,695
Three people can't live in
a one-bedroom flat, right?

22
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,330
This is the toilet.
You share the bathroom.

23
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,771
The dining room and kitchen
are down there.

24
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,777
Our office is down there.

25
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,290
This is the common room
and TV room.

26
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,337
This is your room.

27
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,209
Pocket money and clothes
allowance once a month.

28
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,418
Bugger off!

29
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,536
Can't you see
we're having a fuck?

30
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:50,335
You know that's too loud.
Other people live here, too.

31
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,975
How about some respect
for other people's privacy?

32
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,253
I'm not going to argue with you.
- So just fuck off.

33
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,053
What are you looking at?

34
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,612
There.

35
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,219
Kenny!

36
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,139
Oh, yes! More!

37
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,539
Hey, get it together, right?

38
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,369
Yes, yes, yes ...

39
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,817
Can you feel that?

40
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,092
Look, Thomas is getting all horny.

41
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,849
Like heck.
- How can you eat that stuff?

42
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,609
It tastes great.
- Not two months in a row.

43
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,929
And why do we keep having it?
- Nobody else cooks either.

44
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,815
So don't look at me like that.
- Say hi to Sami.

45
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,176
Want some supper?
- No thanks, I'm not hungry.

46
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,889
Look at that hair!
Does he think it's a carnival?

47
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,139
Look at me! I look like shit.
- You're so full of crap.

48
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,298
Got anything I can borrow?
- Have a look.

49
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,098
Aren't we going soon?
- I can't go like this, can I?

50
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,973
You look great.
- And you're a prat.

51
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,579
How about this one?
- Yes, try it on.

52
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,297
Will you tie me up?
Ouch!

53
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,651
Nice bum.

54
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,652
Hey!

55
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,450
Chill!
- What did you say?

56
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,859
Next time I'll crack your head open.
- Chill! What did I do?

57
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,850
Oooh, taking care of me!
- Those Pakis'll do anything.

58
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,973
They're kids. They haven't even
got hair on their dicks yet.

59
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,618
How much do you want?
- A tenner's worth.

60
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,577
What are you doing tonight?
- Going up to town.

61
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,340
Do you know if
Dennis has a girlfriend?

62
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,211
Anja, he's 24.

63
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,739
So what?

64
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,132
A gift from the Co-op.

65
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,415
How about going back
to Dennis's for a smoke?

66
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,736
We were going up to town.
- We can go later.

67
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,616
We'll never get away from Dennis's.

68
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,369
You could go on ahead.
- And bore myself to death?

69
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,212
Are you coming or what?

70
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,774
Come on!

71
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,852
You said we were
going to have a ball.

72
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,812
We'll have a ball later.

73
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,931
I'm going back to Dennis's.

74
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,971
Me, too.

75
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,697
I'm easy.

76
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,538
Fuck you lot.

77
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,458
Wait a moment, Mille ...

78
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,175
Why not come anyway?
- I don't want to. Get it?

79
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,730
What are you watching?
- Just some series or other.

80
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,219
Aren't you going
to unpack your stuff?

81
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,536
I won't be staying that long.

82
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,492
Where are you going?

83
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,013
To my brother's.

84
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,538
Sit down if you want.

85
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,819
What do you want to listen to?
- You've got loads of CDs.

86
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,573
Mostly hip-hop.
And a bit of r'n'b.

87
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,334
Hi-Low.
I really rate them.

88
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,811
Isn't this you?
- Yes.

89
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,054
You made this?
- With two other guys.

90
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,057
What do you play?

91
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,536
I don't play.
I rap.

92
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,370
OK ...

93
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,293
Mille? Visitors.

94
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,979
Who?

95
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:38,530
I told you not to come here.
- I've locked myself out.

96
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:43,734
What do you expect me to do?
You don't answer your phone.

97
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,017
Come on, then.

98
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,292
I need my pills.
- I'll get them.

99
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,215
I need some water.

100
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,091
What are you up to with Sami?
- I'm not up to anything.

101
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,979
Jette said you were in his room.
- We were just listening to music.

102
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,176
And?
- And nothing.

103
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,853
You fancy him, right?
- I'm going to live with Kenny.

104
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,411
Maybe you've changed your mind.

105
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,297
Give us a drag.

106
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,576
I can just see you and Kenny.
Will you start a family?

107
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,611
Maybe.

108
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,176
No more milk?

109
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,531
Apparently not.

110
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,652
Who finished it?
- He did.

111
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,932
Go and get some more milk.
- Are you talking to me?

112
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,210
Your mum's not here, is she?

113
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,693
What about it?
- Kenny, I'll go and get some.

114
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,052
Like hell ...
hey, I'm talking to you.

115
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,490
Milk.
- You think you're funny?

116
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,895
Cut it out.
- He should watch it.

117
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,053
Kenny!
- Or I'll kill him ...

118
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,097
Kenny, your social worker
is on the phone.

119
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,052
Won't he have to clear it up?
- Yes, he will.

120
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,612
Yeah.

121
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,218
Great.

122
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,939
OK. That's fine.
Cheerio.

123
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:14,136
What did he say?
I don't believe it!

124
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,015
A bedroom and a living room.
We can move in next week.

125
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,649
Come on ...

126
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,132
Come on in.
- Thanks.

127
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,619
It's really cool.

128
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,295
We can almost wave to each other.

129
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,288
Don't you go thinking
you can bother us all the time.

130
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,295
We're going to need new furniture.

131
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,014
I've got some in the basement.

132
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,336
I don't want your old stuff.

133
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,375
No, but there's granny's old kitchen
things and pictures and cushions ...

134
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,014
Mum, I want <i>new</i> furniture.

135
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,051
This one!
- No, this one.

136
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,172
This one's really comfy.
Try it.

137
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,332
Isn't it comfy?
- I prefer that one.

138
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,417
We haven't got room for it.

139
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,178
I want this one.

140
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,093
Go on, Kenny, please?

141
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,098
It says we can borrow the money.

142
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,929
Yes, if the finance company
approves your application.

143
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,096
And they say they won't.

144
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,454
What if we only borrow 5000?
- Makes no difference.

145
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,494
Forget it.

146
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,654
Isn't your break over yet?
- I'm just chilling.

147
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,532
Whassup? I'd like to give you this.

148
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,652
If you want it.

149
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,210
I'd like it.
Thanks.

150
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,096
Nice flat?
- It's OK.

151
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,016
You can help carry stuff.
Then you can see it, too.

152
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,973
I was just on my way out.

153
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,937
Anyway ... 'bye, then.
- 'Bye.

154
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,252
Wait, Sami.

155
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,617
Come over to the flat tonight.
For the party.

156
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,690
All right ... Maybe we will
see each other again, then.

157
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,937
What made you say that?
- You want him to come.

158
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,055
You are so out of line, Anja!

159
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,854
Mille? Bring us some beer, will you?

160
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,938
Hi, Sami!

161
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,618
I didn't think you'd come.
- Shall I beat it?

162
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,538
No. Want a drink?

163
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,091
Yes, please.

164
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,935
Mille fancies you.
Pity she's got a boyfriend.

165
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,331
Hey, you've had enough.

166
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,653
You're doped out.
You'll only chuck up.

167
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,257
What are you doing, you slag?
- Don't call me a slag.

168
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,610
Get off me!
- Get off her.

169
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,288
Mind your own business,
you fruit.

170
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,450
Get off her.
- I'll kill you, you bastard.

171
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,811
Cut it out!
You're pathetic.

172
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,011
Wait!

173
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,095
Are you OK?

174
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,858
Mille!

175
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,859
I'm sorry.

176
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,939
What are you at?

177
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,655
Fucking well come back here!

178
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,579
I must be going.

179
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,452
Mille?

180
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,775
You're not cross, are you?
- No.

181
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,336
Was he good?
- He was really nice to me.

182
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,092
Dennis shags anything that moves.

183
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,979
He said he was in love with me.
- You've only shagged him once.

184
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,372
He was lovely.
- And horny as hell?

185
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,377
It wasn't like that at all.

186
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,019
The Centre Bakery,
Mille speaking.

187
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,496
Mum, I'm at work.

188
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:49,093
I can't talk to you now.
I'll phone you later, OK?

189
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,131
'Bye.

190
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:56,449
A loaf of bread.
Half a litre of milk.

191
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:02,215
And some tobacco.
- You've got legs. Use them!

192
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,297
I've twisted my ankle.

193
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,373
I'm not buying any beer.

194
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,857
Whassup?

195
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,090
Hi! Thomas has just
lifted Hitman 2.

196
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:07,691
What are you so uptight about?
- You just sit around all day.

197
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,698
Get a job
so we can afford furniture!

198
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,697
Like other people!

199
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,818
Don't go in there.

200
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,338
What the fuck ...

201
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,689
Is Dennis in?
- He's humping.

202
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,130
Pack it in.
- Like heck I will.

203
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,853
How much do you want?

204
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,132
Hi.

205
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,619
Come to bed ... I've got a hard-on.

206
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,616
Get off me!
- What's the matter?

207
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,771
Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

208
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,775
Do my football shirt, will you?
- Wash your own clothes.

209
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,410
Hello.
- Hi.

210
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,055
Isn't it cool?
- Yes.

211
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,614
<i>The Attitudes.</i>
<i>We've got a gig coming up.</i>

212
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:01,173
What are you up to?
- Not a lot. Just the washing.

213
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,340
What about you?
- Practice.

214
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,812
Want to come?

215
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,012
The Centre Bakery ...

216
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,814
Hi. She isn't here.

217
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,133
She hasn't been in today.

218
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,258
I'll tell her.
'Bye.

219
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,098
Have you talked to her?
- No. She's uptight all the time.

220
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,292
Why?
- No matter what I do.

221
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,496
It's not my fault
we can't afford that furniture.

222
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:03,331
This mate of my brother's
has got a place full of junk.

223
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:06,816
She wants new stuff.
- He's got new stuff, too.

224
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,330
Furniture, car radios,
builder's supplies.

225
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,656
All kinds of junk.

226
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,332
Hi ...

227
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,657
What brings you here?
Are you in trouble?

228
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,579
No. Kenny could do
with some furniture.

229
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,138
How will you pay?

230
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,853
Dennis said I might
be able to work for you.

231
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:48,133
You can spend up to 10,000.
- Cool.

232
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,889
But you'll owe me 20,000 in labour.

233
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:56,252
OK.
- Start at 8, knock off when I say.

234
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,609
All right?
- Yes.

235
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,176
Well then ... we'll be off.

236
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,972
Coming?

237
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,296
No.
- See you, Mille.

238
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,770
Want to sing in the band?
- No way.

239
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,573
Why not?
- Because I don't want to.

240
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,818
You are so boring!

241
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,416
Are you calling me boring?

242
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,056
Are you going in?
- I'll behave, I'll behave!

243
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,538
Fuck!

244
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,858
What an amazing flat!
Is this where you're moving to?

245
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,810
I was, but I've changed
my mind. It's too small.

246
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,297
I can borrow it
when they're not in, though.

247
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,890
I've got to change my clothes.

248
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,016
There are glasses in the cupboard
if you want.

249
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,216
What the hell is going on?

250
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,168
Sami, have you lost your marbles?

251
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,697
You said you'd got his key back.
- I have.

252
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,176
So why's he lying there?
- How did you get in?

253
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,134
I thought you'd be back tomorrow.
- How did you get in?

254
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,013
With a key, of course.
- What key?

255
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,579
I made a copy ...
- Did I ask you to make a copy?

256
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,771
I'm going.

257
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,210
Sami, what's wrong with you?
- Mille!

258
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,650
Sit down! We've got to talk.

259
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,097
New voice message

260
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,049
I've bought furniture.
Isn't that what you wanted?

261
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:07,452
Where have you been?
- Round town.

262
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,533
Where?
- I just said.

263
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,492
Come and sit down.

264
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,371
Who have you been with?

265
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,775
Nobody ...

266
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:31,936
Don't tell me you were
in town on your own till 5 a.m.

267
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,449
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

268
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:38,175
I don't have to look at you.
I can hear you anyway.

269
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,614
You're lying to me.
- I'm not.

270
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,015
Have you nothing to say?

271
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,492
Don't you care?

272
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,818
I'm going to bed.
I'm due at work in three hours.

273
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,057
Work?
- This stuff didn't come for free.

274
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,375
Aren't you getting up for work?

275
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,971
Are you going to drop him?

276
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,733
Maybe.

277
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,775
You can't do that.
He's just bought new furniture.

278
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,771
Don't tell Dennis I was with
Sami, will you? Promise?

279
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,333
Are you deaf?

280
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,850
You've been going out
for nearly two years.

281
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,292
You were going to have kids.
- Don't tell me what I already know.

282
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,619
What if you change your mind
and he won't have you back?

283
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,414
What will you do?
- How should I know?

284
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,657
You'll have to make up your mind.

285
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,135
Not right now, though.
- You should.

286
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,900
Who for? You?
- For you.

287
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,660
No.
- And Kenny, maybe.

288
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,609
What?
- You can't just piss all over him.

289
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,373
Hi!

290
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,856
I saw you'd finished work.

291
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,176
Sorry about my brother.

292
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,411
He's a jerk.
I don't want to live with him.

293
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,814
Is something up?
- No, not at all.

294
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:44,090
I keep thinking about you.

295
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,053
I can't figure
anything out right now.

296
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,573
You're not for Kenny.
He's a wanker.

297
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,896
I don't want to talk about it.
I'll phone you.

298
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,892
When?

299
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,618
Want some?

300
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,412
Can't we turn it off?
- Why?

301
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,816
Listen ... I ...

302
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,257
What?

303
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,058
I don't think
it's fun any more.

304
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,570
Why don't we ever go to
the cinema or do anything?

305
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,170
We shouldn't live together.

306
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:58,895
I've just got us this flat!
- I know.

307
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,660
And furniture and everything.

308
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:13,250
I just don't feel so much for you.
- What are you playing at?

309
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:20,929
I'm going back to my mum's.
- What the hell is this?

310
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,650
If you go now,
don't fucking well come back.

311
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,449
Collect your junk and fuck off.

312
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,331
You'll make it up.

313
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,138
I've had it with him.

314
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,932
It's over.

315
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,377
They're over there.

316
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:38,936
Say what you like,
but Kenny is a good boy.

317
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,610
Do you mind just shutting up?

318
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,892
I just think
you should think of Kenny.

319
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,694
You're not exactly easy,
as I well know.

320
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,697
Shut the hell up!

321
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,012
Mille!

322
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,379
My little darling ...
- Leave me alone!

323
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,375
There ...
- Get out! Leave me alone!

324
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,937
You were meant to start yesterday.
- Yes, but ...

325
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:45,859
I don't want to hear
your lousy excuses.

326
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,494
Make sure
it doesn't happen again.

327
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:54,734
You stay here till 9 every evening
for the rest of the week. Get it?

328
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,498
Yes.

329
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:00,292
I'm off.
Keep that guy busy.

330
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,371
Shall I make a cup of tea?

331
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,857
If you feel like it.
- Not if you won't drink it.

332
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,176
I will.

333
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,052
Who is it?

334
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:22,328
Mille?
- Let him in!

335
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,691
Mind your own business!
- I've got to talk to you.

336
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,813
You can't just leave him there!
- Stay out of it!

337
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:34,138
Kenny, go away.
- Please, Mille!

338
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,729
Go back inside!

339
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,294
What do you want?
- To talk to you.

340
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:55,129
What have you got to say?
- Let me in first.

341
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:59,651
Can't you just say it?
- You are a real slag.

342
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,098
Shall we go?

343
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:36,376
You and me on stage together.
It'd look so cool!

344
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:40,892
We can have a streamer across the
backdrop saying FEATURING MILLE.

345
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,376
No way.
- It'd be great.

346
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:48,216
No!
- Go on ... it's only for one song.

347
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,654
Hello? Whassup?

348
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,290
Where do you think you're going?

349
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,292
So get ready with your peeps
And come on our trips

350
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,934
Pump the jeeps with
love for hip-hop

351
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:23,416
Fuck the creeps
with all their la-di-dah!

352
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:28,455
What am I meant to sing?
- Let me hear ya all ...

353
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,218
Hear what?
- Let me hear ya all ...

354
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:35,935
Mille wants my black balls ...
- You're so vain!

355
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,736
Have you seen Mille?
- No.

356
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:48,576
If he finds me here he'll go ape.
- The door is locked.

357
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,418
Open up!

358
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,416
Where is she?
- How should I know?

359
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:04,329
I know you've been with her today.
Stay away from her.

360
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,132
Loser!

361
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:09,776
You what?
- Loser! Want me to spell it for you?

362
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:12,740
Stop that!

363
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,618
He shouldn't provoke me.
- You're the psychopath, man.

364
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,971
Stop it, both of you.

365
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,852
If you come here, you behave.

366
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,893
How could you go out with him
for two years?

367
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,735
He's not always like that.

368
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,773
Maybe I should go and see him.

369
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,733
Fuck Kenny.
He's history.

370
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:46,535
He's so upset.
- That's not your problem.

371
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,255
Just don't think about him.

372
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,336
Know what would be really cool?

373
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:03,169
No.
- Having a flat in town.

374
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,336
Know what'd be really cool?

375
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,577
Having a bed right now.

376
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:55,773
You're so childish.
- You're mad about me.

377
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,738
Who says?

378
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,932
Talk about drunk!

379
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,539
Is she always like that?
- She's not usually that bad.

380
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,657
I feel so embarrassed.

381
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,258
It doesn't matter.

382
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,538
Hi, Kenny.

383
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,768
All right?
- Yes.

384
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:10,814
John is worried about you.
We haven't seen much of you.

385
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:14,979
No. It's because I ...
- Because what?

386
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:18,058
I've been ill.
- You've been ill.

387
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:23,215
Yes.
I'll be back tomorrow.

388
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,331
You are too unreliable.

389
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:32,294
John doesn't like
being fucked about.

390
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:37,251
On Friday you show up at
John's office with 20,000. Right?

391
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:07,249
Stop it!

392
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:17,851
Imagine
if we could get away from it all!

393
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:27,497
We could go to New York.
- What for?

394
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:32,292
To make music.
- You?

395
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:36,051
Mille? I thought
it was Kenny who was here.

396
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,935
Mum, get out!
- Who's that?

397
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:43,252
I met him at the hostel.
Now, get out!

398
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:46,179
I won't have his type here.
- Oh, shut it!

399
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,372
Sami has come to see me.
- Get him out of here.

400
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:54,053
Like hell!
You are just ridiculous.

401
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:58,048
Sami, don't mind her.
- It's my flat.

402
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,854
Yes, but this is my room,
so get out!

403
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,655
Sami, don't go!
- I'm out of here.

404
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,012
Sami, wait!

405
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,935
Sami, wait!
- You stay here!

406
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:14,253
You fat cow!
You always ruin everything for me.

407
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,051
You're so fucking stupid.

408
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:24,652
You're not going anywhere.
- That's up to me.

409
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,019
Stay away from me.
Never phone me again.

410
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:36,259
I never want to see you again.
You're just a fucking alkie.

411
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,776
Just leave her
to mind her own business.

412
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:00,096
That's a bit difficult.

413
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,097
Why?

414
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:05,215
I don't want to talk about it.

415
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,935
She's an old piss head.
- Shut up!

416
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:11,894
I think she's really
mean to you, that's all.

417
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:17,252
Whassup?
- Are we going to practice?

418
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,257
Right on.

419
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:43,578
Open the door.

420
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:50,055
You're a real thicko, Kenny.

421
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:54,168
I can't make that
much money by today.

422
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:57,850
Can't you talk to John?
I could start again on Monday.

423
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:01,814
He won't talk to me
after the shit you've pulled.

424
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:09,689
Can't I just have my old room back?
- It's Katja's room now.

425
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:15,971
What about Kenny's room?
- Someone's moving in tomorrow.

426
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:19,013
I just can't stay
at my mum's any more.

427
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:27,259
OK, you can sleep
on the sofa tonight.

428
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,894
I'll find some sheets.

429
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:42,818
Sami!

430
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:02,848
You can have my room.

431
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:06,655
Your room?
- I'm going to live with Dennis.

432
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,652
I'm sick of living out here.

433
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:13,737
What do you mean?

434
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,931
I don't know.

435
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,654
Maybe I could rent a room in town.

436
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:22,936
And live with Sami?
- It's got nothing to do with him.

437
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:30,088
I just want to get away from here.
- You're always with him.

438
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,894
Because
I'm going to sing with his band.

439
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:37,608
What?
- We're playing at Stengade tonight.

440
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:40,015
I didn't know you could sing.

441
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:47,130
Shit! Don't tell him I'm here.
... It's Kenny!

442
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,213
Bloody hell!

443
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:54,215
What happened?
- Where's Mille?

444
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:56,452
She went out.
- Where to?

445
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:59,094
I don't know.
- You know where she is.

446
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,617
Her mum's?
- No, I've just been there.

447
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:07,449
In that case I don't know.
- Tell her I want a word.

448
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:16,249
You've got to talk to him.
He's in a real state.

449
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:18,894
I don't like lying to him.

450
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:24,538
Everyone keeps saying how hard
it is on him: but what about me?

451
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,093
I'm sorry.

452
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:45,135
Your cue is "hear what?"
- I keep forgetting.

453
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:02,250
Get it together!

454
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:04,337
I've had enough.

455
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:18,058
Come on,
we'll just go on till you know it.

456
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:21,377
It sounds like crap
and everyone's pissed off.

457
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:24,174
It's only one song.
You can do it.

458
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:27,779
I've got to go soon.
- Why?

459
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,572
Home to change.

460
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:34,535
You can't! We're on in four hours
and we need to practice and set up.

461
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:38,255
I know.
- Are you going back to your mum's?

462
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:41,816
Yes.
- Come on, get real!

463
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:46,775
You don't want to see her.
- I've got to get my clothes.

464
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:50,537
Run along, then.
But hurry!

465
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:15,098
Mum?

466
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,618
Mum?

467
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:23,378
Fuck!

468
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,692
Mum?

469
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:58,660
Please send an ambulance to
11, Vejlegårds Allé, ground floor.

470
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:02,375
Mille Laursen.

471
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:13,858
Hello?
- <i>Where are you?</i>

472
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:16,415
On my way to hospital
with my mother.

473
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:21,648
<i>Get on down to Stengade.</i>
- <i>I'll phone you later.</i>

474
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:10,251
Mum ...

475
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:24,897
You mustn't do stuff like this.

476
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:30,612
Yes, you and me are a real circus.

477
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:43,657
I've got to phone somebody
I was meant to see.

478
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:47,535
You can just go.
I don't mind.

479
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:51,577
Sure?

480
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:20,931
It's Anja.

481
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,138
Hi ...

482
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,495
Have you seen Mille?

483
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:44,131
I'd drop her if I were you.
- What makes you say so?

484
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:48,489
Don't tell her I told you.
- What?

485
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:52,136
Promise?
- Yes. What?

486
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:56,453
She's singing in Sami's band.

487
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,218
She what?

488
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,690
They're playing tonight.

489
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:11,096
Has she been shagging him?

490
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:15,292
Uh?

491
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:21,296
What do you think?

492
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:06,652
Hi!

493
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:09,772
Why so late?
- I really hurried.

494
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,618
We're due on now.

495
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:41,573
Is that what you're wearing?
- Yes.

496
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:44,931
You look so naff.
- What's the matter <i>now?</i>

497
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:46,778
You went home to change!

498
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:51,929
I've been to hospital with mum.
- You could've changed anyway.

499
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:55,655
You think of nothing
but you and your shitty band.

500
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:03,098
You show up four hours late
looking like I don't know what!

501
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,736
Sing your crap yourself.
I'm not wasting my time.

502
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:10,737
What are you at?
- Fuck you.

503
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:30,617
What are you doing here?
Kenny, don't.

504
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:36,218
Come outside for a talk.
- We've nothing to talk about.

505
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:54,613
Kenny, chill out, for fuck's sake!

506
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,372
Beat it!

507
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:15,651
Fuck you!

508
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:26,698
Whassup, Kenny?

509
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:32,251
Let's go back on.
- You can't play like that.

510
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,774
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

511
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,412
Come here and help him!

512
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:15,219
Help him!
Don't just stand there!

513
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:19,936
Why the hell should we help him?
- He's just lying there.

514
