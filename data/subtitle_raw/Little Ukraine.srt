1
00:01:28,136 --> 00:01:29,136
Look at me.

2
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,577
When we go inside, you
just listen to your cousin.

3
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,445
Mm-hmm.

4
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:36,847
'Cause you'll be
the boss one day.

5
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:40,150
What's wrong?

6
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,184
Those people?

7
00:01:42,887 --> 00:01:46,425
Those people are waiting for us.

8
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:47,892
For what?

9
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:49,247
We'll clean up the neighborhood.

10
00:01:49,995 --> 00:01:52,031
- All of this?
- Yup.

11
00:01:52,064 --> 00:01:56,371
But not like janitors,
more like Superman.

12
00:01:58,138 --> 00:02:00,174
- Dad.
- Like Batman.

13
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:00,942
Like-

14
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:03,911
Like the Guardian Angels.

15
00:02:03,945 --> 00:02:06,882
Yeah, like Guardian Angels.

16
00:02:06,915 --> 00:02:09,552
'Cause there are two things,
best things for a man:

17
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,356
provide

18
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,525
and protect.

19
00:02:14,558 --> 00:02:18,062
And I'll protect you.

20
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:19,095
Always.

21
00:02:27,573 --> 00:02:28,442
Pavel.

22
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:29,476
Vlad.

23
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,510
The people outside.

24
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,016
Hello Uncle.

25
00:02:37,985 --> 00:02:39,186
Speak English now, Pavel.

26
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:40,532
- Where they speak English?
- American.

27
00:02:40,556 --> 00:02:42,023
He forget all of his Russian.

28
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:43,392
- American.
- American.

29
00:02:43,426 --> 00:02:45,060
It's always the same.

30
00:02:45,094 --> 00:02:46,372
How long you gonna
keep this shit up?

31
00:02:46,396 --> 00:02:49,932
Maxim, show Daniel
closing rounds, hmm?

32
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:52,303
Now Pavel, what is this?

33
00:02:52,336 --> 00:02:53,304
What is what?

34
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:54,272
That ugly thing.

35
00:02:54,305 --> 00:02:55,706
It's new sign.

36
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,017
- That's not a sign.
- This is Yuri.

37
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:57,942
He cooks and shit.

38
00:02:57,975 --> 00:02:59,411
Sometimes all at once.

39
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:02,916
English, shithead.

40
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:05,285
Daniel, meet the animals.

41
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,857
You wanna get your
fat ass kicked again?

42
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,224
Pick that up.

43
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:28,645
Ooh, I'm telling.

44
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:37,556
Still short!

45
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,959
Let's go.

46
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:43,128
Let's go.

47
00:03:43,162 --> 00:03:43,964
Muah.

48
00:03:43,996 --> 00:03:45,130
Yes, baby.

49
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:46,165
Come on.

50
00:03:46,198 --> 00:03:47,400
Suka.

51
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:48,536
Suka.
- Yes.

52
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:50,705
Vlad, be quick with that shit.

53
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:52,005
Yes, yes.

54
00:03:52,038 --> 00:03:52,807
Quick, okay.

55
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,477
Okay, okay. Time
to go.

56
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:56,311
What I have said?

57
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:57,513
Let's go.

58
00:03:57,546 --> 00:03:58,580
Come on, come on.

59
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:04,152
Okay, come on.

60
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:05,187
C'mon.

61
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:15,567
Why are we here?

62
00:04:24,076 --> 00:04:25,946
But we paid on time, right?

63
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:28,282
Yes.

64
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:30,585
Checking up on Amerikashka.

65
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:34,122
Your uncle make
good money with us.

66
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:36,725
Good?

67
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,759
For peasants.

68
00:04:39,128 --> 00:04:40,162
I'm here to make great.

69
00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:45,036
But we made our payments, right?

70
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:49,740
And then what is your
concern beyond that?

71
00:04:49,774 --> 00:04:50,775
Vlad, Vlad.

72
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:55,079
Maybe Mr. Ivan have good idea.

73
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:02,121
Nostrovya.

74
00:05:17,272 --> 00:05:19,076
Pull up your drawers,
boys and girls.

75
00:05:19,108 --> 00:05:20,444
Five minutes.

76
00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:22,412
You ready?

77
00:05:22,446 --> 00:05:23,046
Okay.

78
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,415
I was born ready.

79
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,351
The line is: "I was born ready."

80
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:27,819
Geesh.

81
00:05:27,852 --> 00:05:30,154
Hey, what's the opposite of fun?

82
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:31,657
You mean the antonym?

83
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,525
It's Daniel.

84
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:34,258
Yay, Danetchka.

85
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,096
Your new name is Auntie Nim.

86
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,398
Daniel-san.

87
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,533
Yes, a crane
technique if do write.

88
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,036
No can defense.

89
00:05:45,706 --> 00:05:46,907
- Nostrovya.
- Nostrovya.

90
00:05:54,717 --> 00:05:57,152
Tomorrow, I throw party here.

91
00:05:57,185 --> 00:05:58,555
What party?

92
00:05:58,589 --> 00:05:59,590
After hours.

93
00:05:59,623 --> 00:06:01,058
$700, your cut.

94
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:03,060
Bullshit.

95
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:10,136
Who keep junkies and Italians
from shake you down, huh?

96
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:11,202
We are partners.

97
00:06:12,237 --> 00:06:13,237
We're nothing.

98
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:15,609
Ah, Maxim.

99
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,276
You check everything?

100
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,745
Oh, we have a visitor.

101
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:19,779
Come here.

102
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:22,315
Come.

103
00:06:24,786 --> 00:06:26,120
Looks just like you, Pavel.

104
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:29,524
A gift

105
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:31,527
for my partner's son.

106
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:37,867
Please open it.

107
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:38,901
Open it.

108
00:06:41,772 --> 00:06:42,773
Go ahead.

109
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:43,841
Put it in your hand.

110
00:06:43,874 --> 00:06:45,276
Feel the weight.

111
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:53,720
Knife was used.

112
00:06:53,753 --> 00:06:54,754
Sorry, I clean.

113
00:06:58,525 --> 00:06:59,525
Like new.

114
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:03,732
Leave him alone!

115
00:07:03,765 --> 00:07:05,333
Leave him alone!

116
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,403
Daniel!

117
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:08,436
Daniel.

118
00:07:10,406 --> 00:07:11,207
Daniel.

119
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:12,341
Get the car.

120
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,242
Shut the fuck up.

121
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:14,275
Get the car.

122
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:24,526
You know, funding
should be a portion

123
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,963
according to the needs
of the district, right?

124
00:08:26,996 --> 00:08:29,866
Now we need affordable housing
in my district this cycle.

125
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:31,000
If we go into that room

126
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:34,238
sounding like Karl
Marx's cliff notes,

127
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:36,774
then we're gonna need
new jobs in November.

128
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:40,312
Now you all know Mr.
Dan Reznick Esquire

129
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:43,315
from the Newark Works employment
outreach in my district?

130
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:44,283
Hammer of the gods.

131
00:08:44,317 --> 00:08:45,518
I'm sorry?

132
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:47,453
Well you're 3/5
of the city council.

133
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:50,357
You have Mayor
Apple gate at your mercy.

134
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,559
Okay, so how's that gonna help

135
00:08:52,593 --> 00:08:55,430
to get affordable
housing in my district?

136
00:08:55,463 --> 00:08:56,931
Well respectfully,

137
00:08:56,965 --> 00:08:59,667
this is already one of the
most affordable communities

138
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:00,636
in the county.

139
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:01,871
Right.

140
00:09:01,904 --> 00:09:03,906
So then why do I have
four overflown shelters

141
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:05,040
in my district?

142
00:09:05,074 --> 00:09:08,678
Many of the people in those
shelters were my clients.

143
00:09:08,712 --> 00:09:10,313
Hmm, I get it.

144
00:09:10,348 --> 00:09:11,581
So you'll agree then?

145
00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:13,751
We just need to stick
our heels in the dirt,

146
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:16,287
build affordable homes while
there's still HUD money.

147
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,390
Our friends at those shelters

148
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:21,393
wouldn't have a problem
finding affordable homes

149
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:24,330
if we could fix their
problem finding employment.

150
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:25,665
I like where you're goin'.

151
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:26,866
Bras tacks.

152
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,301
Brass tacks?

153
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:31,071
You form a voting block
on the HUD allocation.

154
00:09:31,105 --> 00:09:33,474
Promise Mayor Apple gate
smooth sailing

155
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:38,280
on the downtown
development if and only if

156
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:41,317
you control the resident
employment allocations.

157
00:09:41,351 --> 00:09:42,718
Mm-hmm, see?

158
00:09:42,752 --> 00:09:46,323
Trade votes for higher
paying jobs in our districts.

159
00:09:47,124 --> 00:09:48,492
How many jobs?

160
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:49,960
Well fast and dirty?

161
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:54,432
With a maintenance contract
guarantee tacked on,

162
00:09:54,465 --> 00:09:58,504
I'd say at least 300 jobs
in the first six months.

163
00:09:58,537 --> 00:10:00,639
Hire them
right outta the shelter.

164
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:05,512
I took the liberty
to begin drafting a bid

165
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:07,480
and the hiring
practices guidelines

166
00:10:07,514 --> 00:10:09,517
for your review of course.

167
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,420
Counselor, flip me your card.

168
00:10:11,452 --> 00:10:12,629
I have a few good constituents

169
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,823
that could use help
staying in their homes.

170
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:20,431
I'm not practicing
at the moment.

171
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:23,933
Oh, well I expect
we'll see a lot of you.

172
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:25,601
Keep up the fight.

173
00:10:25,635 --> 00:10:27,004
Yeah.

174
00:10:27,037 --> 00:10:28,037
Thanks.

175
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:50,664
Yes?

176
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:53,634
They're comin'.

177
00:10:53,668 --> 00:10:55,237
When?

178
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,408
24 to 42 hours from now.

179
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:01,945
But I told 'em that
I would go to them.

180
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:04,614
I know,
but they don't want that.

181
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:05,850
So what do they want?

182
00:11:05,883 --> 00:11:06,751
They wanna
make an example of you

183
00:11:06,784 --> 00:11:07,784
in your home.

184
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,127
Am I just supposed to take that?

185
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,237
Listen to me.

186
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:19,799
Get your wife and your
family outta your house now.

187
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:22,769
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:37,586 --> 00:11:38,754
How are you?

189
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,925
Good see you tonight.

190
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,462
Me?

191
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,596
Fucking great.

192
00:11:56,108 --> 00:11:58,446
Good week. Pretty, pretty good.

193
00:12:00,213 --> 00:12:02,616
You know, my offer still stands.

194
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:06,187
Crazy we still do this.

195
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,556
I work this week.

196
00:12:07,588 --> 00:12:09,392
You work next.

197
00:12:09,425 --> 00:12:12,495
Either one of us own
only half business.

198
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:14,063
At least sit down with me.

199
00:12:15,698 --> 00:12:19,636
I make you fair offer: buy
out your half of the business.

200
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:26,579
Until next week.

201
00:12:54,744 --> 00:12:59,182
Yo, what the fuck you
doin' out here, white boy?

202
00:13:05,055 --> 00:13:06,191
Nice rims.

203
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:15,502
I could sneak up on
Snowden in this shit.

204
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:18,071
Oh yeah. Yeah, definitely.

205
00:13:18,105 --> 00:13:20,508
Conflict minerals sure
are stealthy in that.

206
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,711
Fuck I tell you about this shit?

207
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,582
I do need that bread, man.

208
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:29,251
Three months.

209
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:35,858
Um.

210
00:13:38,094 --> 00:13:39,997
Fuck you, man.

211
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:41,032
Fuck you.

212
00:13:41,065 --> 00:13:42,767
Ah come on, man.

213
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,612
Yo, the council boy's doin'
you all right down the way?

214
00:13:44,636 --> 00:13:46,573
Yeah, I don't have
the formal approval yet.

215
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:48,183
But I'm tellin' you I
got these guys right-

216
00:13:48,207 --> 00:13:49,609
Listen, listen, listen.

217
00:13:49,642 --> 00:13:50,686
I told you you supposed
to call me, all right?

218
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,580
I told you call me.

219
00:13:54,948 --> 00:13:56,082
C'mon, let's go.

220
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:09,633
I knew all about
your little meeting.

221
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,069
No coincidences, huh?

222
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,938
Shit.

223
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:15,972
This is my town.

224
00:14:19,277 --> 00:14:20,679
It was a no-brainer for them.

225
00:14:20,713 --> 00:14:21,647
I did all the work.

226
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,249
I wrote the proposal.
I drew up the playbook.

227
00:14:25,585 --> 00:14:27,119
Did you tell the councilwoman

228
00:14:27,152 --> 00:14:28,152
that you got disbarred?

229
00:14:29,822 --> 00:14:31,057
No.

230
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:32,693
No, I was suspended.

231
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:33,927
Not disbarred.

232
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,895
Same thing. Shit
came up anyway.

233
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:36,732
When?

234
00:14:36,764 --> 00:14:38,232
Right after you left.

235
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:40,702
I just got the play by play.

236
00:14:40,736 --> 00:14:43,740
Well you know, it's a
matter of public record.

237
00:14:43,772 --> 00:14:45,107
It looks like a reason for them

238
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,042
to shift this grant money
in another direction.

239
00:14:47,075 --> 00:14:48,878
You mean all this
work for nothin'?

240
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:49,911
No.

241
00:14:51,448 --> 00:14:54,852
They'll use your playbook
but probably without you.

242
00:14:54,885 --> 00:14:56,253
Yeah. And if I
raise the stake,

243
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:57,756
they just tossed the whole thing

244
00:14:57,788 --> 00:14:59,257
and nothing good
comes out of it.

245
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:00,325
Catchin' on quick, son.

246
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,293
Fuck, man.

247
00:15:01,326 --> 00:15:02,471
They'd be walkin' to City Hall

248
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:05,732
with their tail between their
legs if it weren't for me.

249
00:15:05,766 --> 00:15:06,667
You're right.

250
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,267
Listen, I told you, all right?

251
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:10,505
You ain't from around here.

252
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:12,039
Your shit wasn't
gonna go any farther

253
00:15:12,072 --> 00:15:14,575
than what you could
already finance on your own

254
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:17,746
unless you had a born
and bred on board.

255
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,714
Born and bred?

256
00:15:18,747 --> 00:15:19,782
Like who?

257
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:22,318
Me, for one.

258
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:23,351
You?

259
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:27,022
You wanna be in the
job placement business?

260
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:27,991
No.

261
00:15:28,024 --> 00:15:31,861
I wanna be in the Daniel
Reznick business, son.

262
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:34,399
Fuck outta here.

263
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,367
Listen.

264
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:38,470
People in this
community, they love you.

265
00:15:38,503 --> 00:15:39,515
They love you in
this neighborhood.

266
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,973
You've been helpin'
people for years and years

267
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,911
for no other reason but
just because they need it.

268
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,014
Shit.

269
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,384
And I know that a nice
little Jewish boy like you

270
00:15:50,418 --> 00:15:52,353
don't mess up no bill payments.

271
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:53,822
So you got to be fucked up

272
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:56,391
if I'm sittin' here waitin'
on three months rent.

273
00:15:56,425 --> 00:15:58,728
I told you I was gonna take
care of that this weekend.

274
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:00,830
I know, I know.

275
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:04,867
You can go home and run
to your pops and get that.

276
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,736
But what I'm saying-

277
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:07,839
- Really?
- Listen, what I'm sayin'.

278
00:16:08,905 --> 00:16:09,905
What I'm offering

279
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:14,245
is a chance for you to
get out on your own.

280
00:16:15,814 --> 00:16:18,082
Get you some of
that grant money.

281
00:16:18,116 --> 00:16:21,353
Get you a nice little
six-figure salary,

282
00:16:21,387 --> 00:16:23,823
your little office and
your rent paid for,

283
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,726
electricity paid for.

284
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:28,894
What's in it for you?

285
00:16:31,098 --> 00:16:33,200
My name already ring
out in the streets.

286
00:16:35,403 --> 00:16:37,205
A restaurateur or producer,

287
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,443
real estate magnate.

288
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:44,112
But with you?

289
00:16:46,015 --> 00:16:50,822
I am going to be Newark's
homegrown savior of District 6.

290
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:55,828
I'm in charge.

291
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:57,028
That's fine.

292
00:16:57,061 --> 00:16:58,565
Listen, I just wanna
make a few calls

293
00:16:58,598 --> 00:17:00,767
and give you a big enough
lane to run right through.

294
00:17:08,008 --> 00:17:09,008
So?

295
00:17:11,412 --> 00:17:12,815
Make your calls.

296
00:17:12,848 --> 00:17:14,949
My man, my man.

297
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:16,453
Yeah, just listen.

298
00:17:16,486 --> 00:17:19,121
You're just gonna godfather
this thing through, right?

299
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:21,625
I don't do well
with partnerships.

300
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:23,226
Oh, this ain't no
partnership, see?

301
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:26,430
We gon' Batman and Robin
this motherfucker.

302
00:17:28,232 --> 00:17:30,067
Go home, D.

303
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,069
10 minutes and I'm out.

304
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,990
It's gonna be too big.

305
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:20,628
Oh.

306
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:22,328
This I like.

307
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:23,531
Think so?

308
00:18:23,564 --> 00:18:24,565
Absolutely.

309
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,002
Thank you.

310
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:29,906
You look good to me.

311
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:30,939
It's beautiful.

312
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,174
Can't take your eyes off?

313
00:18:34,142 --> 00:18:36,513
Really will match perfectly
with the living room set

314
00:18:36,547 --> 00:18:38,549
in our new house in the country.

315
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:40,082
Bid 95.

316
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:42,953
Thank you.

317
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:49,294
Are you familiar with
von Ostrowski or Serrano?

318
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,997
It's very important.

319
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,000
Yes, I remember.

320
00:18:54,034 --> 00:18:56,536
Von Ostrowski worked
in fecal matter.

321
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,005
Like Ofili, right?

322
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,307
Right, but he also
worked in ejaculate.

323
00:19:01,576 --> 00:19:02,576
Sorry?

324
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:06,014
He use it as a glaze
in some of his painting.

325
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:08,683
Oh.

326
00:19:10,118 --> 00:19:13,221
Actually the influence
runs throughout this show.

327
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:14,992
Maybe we should-

328
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:17,427
It'll change color as it ages.

329
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:20,999
Yes, with a wonderful
organic patina.

330
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:23,467
That might not work.

331
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,973
We're gonna take a look
at a few other pieces

332
00:19:27,006 --> 00:19:28,273
before we decide.

333
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:29,008
Sure.

334
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,375
Take your time.

335
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:38,218
Not a word, Maxim.

336
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:39,554
15K.

337
00:19:39,587 --> 00:19:40,588
That's some money shot.

338
00:19:40,622 --> 00:19:42,255
Egg whites.

339
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:42,991
Liar, liar.

340
00:19:43,024 --> 00:19:45,027
I only told them influence.

341
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,630
Expensive pomposity, cousin.

342
00:19:47,663 --> 00:19:49,466
Nate Dogg, you catch that?

343
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:51,635
I'll need five minutes
alone with him.

344
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:53,803
You just love rejection.

345
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:55,539
That old Jack is ready to sell.

346
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:56,272
This time it's real.

347
00:19:56,306 --> 00:19:57,440
He's meeting me tomorrow.

348
00:19:57,475 --> 00:20:00,310
I need 3 maybe 4 million
from Nathan, tops.

349
00:20:00,343 --> 00:20:03,214
Oh, that's all?

350
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:08,386
Fuck.

351
00:20:09,187 --> 00:20:11,000
And when you figure they'll
be finished over there?

352
00:20:11,024 --> 00:20:13,527
First part of the
Market Line, 2019.

353
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,029
That soon, huh?

354
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:18,399
The high line meets
Italy via Brooklyn Fleet

355
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:20,167
but more upscale.

356
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,212
And at the base of a couple
hundred thousand square feet

357
00:20:22,236 --> 00:20:23,739
of the hottest condos in town.

358
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,710
Okay and our targets, where
are the current rents at now?

359
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:29,178
It's in the gutter.

360
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:31,414
I'll work these
buildings like a maniac.

361
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:34,216
I'll evict the
non-payees, the non-B&Bers

362
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,653
and relocate the stragglers.

363
00:20:36,754 --> 00:20:38,156
That's a tall order.

364
00:20:38,188 --> 00:20:40,158
I'm gonna make 'em an
offer they can't refuse.

365
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,194
Can we do that?

366
00:20:43,227 --> 00:20:45,531
I've worked this with a
few of Mr. W's buildings.

367
00:20:45,564 --> 00:20:47,167
I know the tenants.

368
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:49,669
I know who's a deadbeat,
who's a drug dealer,

369
00:20:49,703 --> 00:20:52,139
which little old lady's
ready to move to Florida.

370
00:20:53,174 --> 00:20:55,609
All right, so how long 'til
we can clear them all out?

371
00:20:55,643 --> 00:20:57,044
A year, 18 months tops.

372
00:21:01,683 --> 00:21:02,683
What's the catch?

373
00:21:03,753 --> 00:21:05,688
You're getting an amazing price.

374
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,222
The pricing is the by-product

375
00:21:07,255 --> 00:21:09,059
of a decade of
indentured servitude.

376
00:21:11,528 --> 00:21:12,528
All right.

377
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,442
I need a quick
answer for the old man

378
00:21:14,466 --> 00:21:16,101
before he has time
to reconsider.

379
00:21:17,135 --> 00:21:18,136
Do I have a partner?

380
00:21:22,475 --> 00:21:23,475
15 million?

381
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:31,417
When can you get a copy
of the PPM to my attorney?

382
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:31,853
Next week.

383
00:21:31,886 --> 00:21:32,886
Not a problem.

384
00:21:35,288 --> 00:21:36,591
Come by, we'll have a drink.

385
00:21:38,727 --> 00:21:43,466
This guy.

386
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,220
Don't scare me like that.

387
00:22:22,244 --> 00:22:23,245
I'm sorry.

388
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:26,315
Look, Vlad. One,
two, three, four.

389
00:22:26,348 --> 00:22:27,551
Four place settings.

390
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,386
- Right.
- I just set the table.

391
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:30,419
Right.

392
00:22:34,693 --> 00:22:36,427
I'll be back at 2:00.

393
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,460
Da, da.

394
00:22:39,665 --> 00:22:41,234
You're a good boy.

395
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:42,902
Always happy.

396
00:22:42,936 --> 00:22:44,637
I try my best.

397
00:22:44,671 --> 00:22:47,842
Those three walk ups on
Delancey, you got your price?

398
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,342
12.

399
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:52,346
12 million is a gift
for those three buildings.

400
00:22:52,379 --> 00:22:54,415
Of course, keep
it in the family.

401
00:22:54,448 --> 00:22:57,687
Boychik, I gotta know
you got the money, hmm?

402
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,356
Two weeks, I got 100 brokers
chasing me down the street.

403
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,495
I'll get you proof
of funds by tomorrow.

404
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:06,462
Good.

405
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,666
Now go hump something
young tonight, hmm?

406
00:23:09,968 --> 00:23:11,435
My dick hasn't worked
since the 1980s

407
00:23:11,468 --> 00:23:14,372
and you're not getting
any younger yourself.

408
00:23:14,405 --> 00:23:15,574
Moshe! Yeah, you.

409
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:16,742
Bring my shoes.

410
00:23:26,854 --> 00:23:28,489
Unc, everything all right?

411
00:23:28,522 --> 00:23:29,522
Yeah.

412
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:10,873
I got the TV for her room.

413
00:24:10,906 --> 00:24:12,274
She'll be real comfortable.

414
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:17,579
Look.

415
00:24:18,782 --> 00:24:23,788
I'm usually in the old
neighborhood in the mornings,

416
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:29,227
so I can pop in on Pavel
and check in on things.

417
00:24:30,662 --> 00:24:33,298
Sasha, just make sure she
takes her pills every day.

418
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:35,667
Sasha.

419
00:24:36,903 --> 00:24:38,271
I was just thinking.

420
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,343
I know you don't like me there,

421
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:46,281
but Pavel needs someone
checkin' on him.

422
00:24:50,051 --> 00:24:53,356
No, no, no.

423
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:24,138
Police!
Put your hands up!

424
00:26:24,162 --> 00:26:26,465
Put your hands up!

425
00:26:29,502 --> 00:26:31,804
I'm teachin' at Rutgers
again this semester.

426
00:26:33,207 --> 00:26:34,451
Yeah. With Amtrak,
it's really easy.

427
00:26:34,475 --> 00:26:37,945
So I promise we'll make
it happen this time.

428
00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:40,482
Hit one of those
Rodezio spots on me.

429
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:43,451
Where's his head?

430
00:26:43,485 --> 00:26:44,620
He's good.

431
00:26:44,653 --> 00:26:46,122
You know, considering, right?

432
00:26:47,557 --> 00:26:48,958
What're we lookin' at?

433
00:26:48,991 --> 00:26:52,662
Daniel, you know I can't.

434
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:53,696
Okay.

435
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:55,533
Thanks.

436
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:57,635
You got it.

437
00:26:57,668 --> 00:26:59,036
Mr. Reznick.

438
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,572
Look, don't talk details.

439
00:27:00,606 --> 00:27:01,883
He's been in solitary
the last three days,

440
00:27:01,907 --> 00:27:03,909
so just be together.

441
00:27:05,177 --> 00:27:06,177
'Kay.

442
00:27:12,218 --> 00:27:13,219
Just one?

443
00:27:14,155 --> 00:27:15,456
15 minutes.

444
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:22,964
You look good.

445
00:27:22,998 --> 00:27:23,998
Yeah.

446
00:27:24,867 --> 00:27:26,068
Yeah, you too.

447
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,171
And you're going to
see your mother tonight.

448
00:27:28,204 --> 00:27:29,038
Yeah.

449
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:30,440
Good. That's great.

450
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:33,911
Dad-

451
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,713
Yeah, just tell
her that I'm strong.

452
00:27:35,747 --> 00:27:37,882
I'm good. Everything is fine.

453
00:27:37,916 --> 00:27:39,951
And you'll take care of
her while I'm here, right?

454
00:27:39,984 --> 00:27:40,984
Of course.

455
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:44,190
Your Uncle Sasha will
be there for a week.

456
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,960
Dad, what happened?

457
00:27:49,763 --> 00:27:50,931
I'd like to ask you.

458
00:27:51,998 --> 00:27:52,999
What happened with you?

459
00:27:53,901 --> 00:27:54,869
I didn't know.

460
00:27:54,902 --> 00:27:56,270
I was in Newark.

461
00:27:56,304 --> 00:27:57,104
I'm helping someone.

462
00:27:57,138 --> 00:27:58,172
Well you're in Newark.

463
00:27:58,206 --> 00:27:59,609
You're always in Newark

464
00:27:59,642 --> 00:28:01,143
with those junkies
running like crazy.

465
00:28:02,144 --> 00:28:04,514
They're not and I'm fine.

466
00:28:04,548 --> 00:28:06,650
What happened this time?

467
00:28:07,651 --> 00:28:09,219
A little boy almost died.

468
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:10,555
Oh, sorry.

469
00:28:12,156 --> 00:28:13,991
So you're a doctor now?

470
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:16,895
No, they need my help.

471
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,530
Can you help?

472
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:20,065
- Yes.
- Like an attorney.

473
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:24,638
Well not in this instance, no.

474
00:28:24,671 --> 00:28:25,805
But you are an attorney.

475
00:28:27,675 --> 00:28:29,644
Well uh, the thing I wanted to-

476
00:28:29,677 --> 00:28:33,649
I can't hear you, Daniel.

477
00:28:33,682 --> 00:28:34,682
I got suspended.

478
00:28:36,184 --> 00:28:37,184
You got suspended.

479
00:28:38,688 --> 00:28:40,624
My license to practice law.

480
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:44,094
For how long?

481
00:28:44,127 --> 00:28:45,528
Three years.

482
00:28:45,563 --> 00:28:48,566
For how long didn't you tell me?

483
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,301
Let me walk the
streets like an idiot.

484
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:52,738
Dad, I was gonna tell you.

485
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,771
I tried to so many times.

486
00:28:53,804 --> 00:28:55,106
How long did you?

487
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:58,243
- Six months.
- How come?

488
00:29:00,245 --> 00:29:01,682
I was doin' the right thing.

489
00:29:04,851 --> 00:29:07,221
You're not an attorney anymore.

490
00:29:07,254 --> 00:29:08,623
Not for three years.

491
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:19,268
I was thinking this is
the time when I need my son,

492
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:24,141
the big shot lawyer to help me,

493
00:29:26,209 --> 00:29:27,612
to protect me.

494
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:34,319
And instead, you're
helping those people.

495
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,657
Dad, those people needed me.

496
00:29:37,691 --> 00:29:39,958
I needed you.

497
00:29:45,265 --> 00:29:46,735
What happened?

498
00:29:46,768 --> 00:29:47,768
Doesn't matter.

499
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,271
Telly will take care of this.

500
00:29:50,304 --> 00:29:51,740
- I can help.
- No.

501
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:53,676
- That's why I'm here.
- No, Daniel.

502
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,345
Listen, all I want you is
to take care of your mother.

503
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,719
I can help.

504
00:30:01,752 --> 00:30:03,753
And Maxim will take care
of my week at the banya.

505
00:30:05,322 --> 00:30:06,924
- Maxim?
- Yes.

506
00:30:06,957 --> 00:30:08,258
Why Maxim? I'm your son.

507
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:10,962
And you have to see Anielka.

508
00:30:12,364 --> 00:30:14,934
- Ani?
- Yes, Ani.

509
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:18,037
Ani, she's been taking
care of your mother.

510
00:30:22,744 --> 00:30:24,253
If you want me to
look at your account-

511
00:30:24,277 --> 00:30:25,278
No.

512
00:30:26,682 --> 00:30:28,216
'Kay, just gimme
five more minutes.

513
00:30:28,249 --> 00:30:29,249
Come on!

514
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:15,303
Kid.

515
00:31:16,472 --> 00:31:17,273
You all right?

516
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:18,307
Yeah.

517
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:27,318
Oh, Prince Danetchka!

518
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:28,152
Sit, sit, sit.

519
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,723
We miss you so much.

520
00:31:30,757 --> 00:31:34,359
Law degree like 100,000.

521
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:37,898
He practice seven years.

522
00:31:37,932 --> 00:31:42,871
Shit, that's like 300%
return on investment

523
00:31:42,904 --> 00:31:45,740
before they revoke license.

524
00:31:45,774 --> 00:31:47,142
Dad, enough.

525
00:31:47,175 --> 00:31:48,376
What?

526
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:51,046
Just like when I
get credit card,

527
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:54,885
buy thousands worth
of stuff, hmm?

528
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:58,155
Throw card away, report stolen.

529
00:31:58,188 --> 00:31:59,256
Can't keep forever.

530
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:00,892
What?

531
00:32:00,925 --> 00:32:01,726
Hit up the Koreans
last week in Coney.

532
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:03,137
Hey Kostya, where you been?

533
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:04,897
- At the Sweet Shop?
- What happened?

534
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,264
What happened to the inspector?

535
00:32:06,297 --> 00:32:07,297
Hey.

536
00:32:10,904 --> 00:32:13,005
The sidewalk may
crumble under foot.

537
00:32:14,508 --> 00:32:15,977
Ani?

538
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:18,211
She's all grows up
and she's all grows up.

539
00:32:19,179 --> 00:32:21,015
The most overrated movie ever.

540
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:23,886
I can't believe it.

541
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,088
You were just-

542
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:26,890
14.

543
00:32:26,923 --> 00:32:27,924
Right.
- Yeah.

544
00:32:27,957 --> 00:32:30,459
Drink, stranger.

545
00:32:46,244 --> 00:32:47,245
You look great.

546
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:50,158
Not as good as he did
at your eighth grade prom.

547
00:32:50,182 --> 00:32:51,250
Shut up.

548
00:32:51,284 --> 00:32:52,318
Max.

549
00:32:52,351 --> 00:32:53,452
What?

550
00:32:53,486 --> 00:32:55,567
I wanted to take Nana to
the prom, but she dissed me.

551
00:32:58,026 --> 00:33:00,161
I'm good.

552
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:01,997
My father asked me
to come see you.

553
00:33:02,865 --> 00:33:04,365
He looks good?

554
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,002
Yeah.

555
00:33:06,036 --> 00:33:07,036
Well.

556
00:33:08,137 --> 00:33:09,606
Yeah.

557
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:10,941
Bunch of shite's what it is.

558
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:14,244
We'll have him home in no time.

559
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:21,920
So

560
00:33:21,954 --> 00:33:23,355
Newark, huh?

561
00:33:23,388 --> 00:33:24,388
Yup.

562
00:33:25,892 --> 00:33:28,160
Daniel hated makin' bank.

563
00:33:28,193 --> 00:33:29,195
Not true.

564
00:33:29,228 --> 00:33:31,031
I was rooting that
he would leave this

565
00:33:31,065 --> 00:33:32,833
white shit behind.

566
00:33:35,369 --> 00:33:37,839
Well they didn't need
me in that world anymore.

567
00:33:39,007 --> 00:33:41,209
We all have to find
where we are needed.

568
00:33:41,911 --> 00:33:43,913
Speaking of where
we're needed, excuse me.

569
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:51,355
Are you going to
stick around this time?

570
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,968
No, I'm just here
for a few days.

571
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:55,627
I have responsibilities
in Newark.

572
00:33:57,997 --> 00:33:59,497
And whose
responsibility is that?

573
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:03,069
He's a good egg,

574
00:34:03,103 --> 00:34:06,505
but he will really benefit
from a steady-level head

575
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:07,941
like yours around here.

576
00:34:11,812 --> 00:34:13,915
My father doesn't
want me involved.

577
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:15,182
Your father listens to me.

578
00:34:15,216 --> 00:34:16,216
Ani.

579
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:19,520
I don't think I should be here.

580
00:34:20,623 --> 00:34:24,961
You haven't been here a
lot, not since I was a girl.

581
00:34:27,463 --> 00:34:29,600
But for some reason,

582
00:34:29,633 --> 00:34:32,003
this place seems complete
when you're around.

583
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,507
I'll come back more often.

584
00:34:38,678 --> 00:34:39,678
I promise.

585
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:47,253
Keep this one off the floor.

586
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:48,287
You will slip.

587
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:52,292
And we need this head
of yours in one piece.

588
00:35:11,717 --> 00:35:13,451
They rob us!

589
00:35:13,484 --> 00:35:14,585
Damn shakedown!

590
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:15,419
Rob us?

591
00:35:15,453 --> 00:35:16,956
They can shut us down.

592
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,091
What, your hand's broke?

593
00:35:18,124 --> 00:35:19,257
You can't make call?

594
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:24,131
Only numbers you know are for
bookie, OTB and loan shark

595
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:26,166
for when you lose
to bookie and OTB.

596
00:35:27,233 --> 00:35:30,939
You're going to bankrupt us
with this shit, fuckin' suka!

597
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,640
- Suka?
- Suka!

598
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:34,542
Come here, I bend you over!

599
00:35:34,576 --> 00:35:35,576
Make you my suka!

600
00:35:37,378 --> 00:35:38,378
Stop!

601
00:35:39,716 --> 00:35:41,550
Three days!

602
00:35:41,584 --> 00:35:42,986
Three days, my father's gone.

603
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:44,587
This place is already-

604
00:35:44,621 --> 00:35:45,522
Danny.

605
00:35:45,555 --> 00:35:47,424
Get your father upstairs!

606
00:35:47,457 --> 00:35:49,160
Come on.

607
00:36:22,465 --> 00:36:24,367
Hurts more than
you think, you know?

608
00:36:29,174 --> 00:36:30,251
I mean all that stuff
you see in the movies

609
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:33,478
about people gettin' cut
and people gettin' stabbed,

610
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:36,015
you wouldn't think it
hurt as much, but it does.

611
00:36:38,584 --> 00:36:41,188
You know I gotta
get an eye patch?

612
00:36:41,221 --> 00:36:43,624
Yeah, I'm gonna be
like Snake Plissken.

613
00:36:45,126 --> 00:36:46,260
What's he say?

614
00:36:46,294 --> 00:36:49,798
"I don't give a fudge about
your war or your president."

615
00:36:52,768 --> 00:36:54,103
"Escape from New York".

616
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,505
Daniel?

617
00:36:59,442 --> 00:37:00,442
Daniel.

618
00:37:00,778 --> 00:37:01,778
Come on, Daniel.

619
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,680
Any sound in there?

620
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:07,652
Danetchka. Daniel.

621
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:08,820
They're gonna be fine.

622
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:10,155
Just make sure they both take

623
00:37:10,188 --> 00:37:12,658
their full course
of antibiotics.

624
00:37:12,692 --> 00:37:14,459
- Thank you very much, Doctor.
- That's it?

625
00:37:14,492 --> 00:37:15,294
I'm done?

626
00:37:15,328 --> 00:37:17,097
Yeah.

627
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,765
Hey, hey. Don't play with that.

628
00:37:18,799 --> 00:37:19,733
You'll be back in a couple days

629
00:37:19,766 --> 00:37:21,434
to see the plastic surgeon, Max.

630
00:37:21,467 --> 00:37:22,737
So just relax.

631
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:23,805
The name's Plissken.

632
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,040
- Excuse me?
- And I don't give a fudge

633
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:28,310
about your war or
your president.

634
00:37:28,344 --> 00:37:29,611
Thank you, Doctor.

635
00:37:29,645 --> 00:37:30,746
Thank you very much.

636
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:31,814
"Escape from New York".

637
00:37:31,847 --> 00:37:33,515
- Thank you.
- Take care, gentlemen.

638
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:36,385
Hey, look what
somebody brought for you.

639
00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:37,187
Whoa.

640
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,621
How 'bout that?

641
00:37:38,655 --> 00:37:40,291
Young Guardian Angels.

642
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,559
Let's go home now.

643
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,733
Let's go. Mametchka had
cooked some lamb for you.

644
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,167
Let's go. Just be careful, yeah?

645
00:38:21,205 --> 00:38:22,807
That everything?

646
00:38:25,911 --> 00:38:27,413
Speak English here.

647
00:38:28,213 --> 00:38:30,650
Collect 50% from that
asshole selling coke.

648
00:38:32,285 --> 00:38:34,205
Make an example of him if
he says anything, okay?

649
00:38:35,723 --> 00:38:36,623
My pleasure.

650
00:38:36,657 --> 00:38:38,659
Be back at 11:00.

651
00:39:28,885 --> 00:39:30,519
Daniel.

652
00:39:30,552 --> 00:39:31,721
Daniel.

653
00:39:31,755 --> 00:39:33,224
Nyet.

654
00:39:35,493 --> 00:39:36,861
Katya.

655
00:39:36,894 --> 00:39:37,894
Katya!

656
00:40:00,822 --> 00:40:02,958
Hey Robert, Robert, Robert.

657
00:40:02,992 --> 00:40:04,226
How 'bout another coffee?

658
00:40:17,574 --> 00:40:20,479
Katya.

659
00:40:23,883 --> 00:40:28,421
Robert.

660
00:40:28,455 --> 00:40:29,757
It's a dangerous neighborhood.

661
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:32,568
I think I'll be okay.

662
00:40:32,592 --> 00:40:33,592
Whoa.

663
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:40,402
Robert here thinks that the
Russian mafia is after us.

664
00:40:41,337 --> 00:40:42,772
I'm not on the clock.

665
00:40:42,805 --> 00:40:43,906
No?

666
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,342
Were you on the clock when
we're having coffee inside.

667
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:51,348
That could've gone wrong
in 100 different ways.

668
00:40:51,381 --> 00:40:52,382
Thank you.

669
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:54,518
This only gets worse.

670
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:59,058
By the way, we can
take care of our own.

671
00:41:23,453 --> 00:41:23,953
What are you?

672
00:41:23,987 --> 00:41:25,121
I'm Julia Shields.

673
00:41:25,155 --> 00:41:26,524
I'm from the firm, Mr. Reznick.

674
00:41:26,557 --> 00:41:27,725
Where is Telly?

675
00:41:27,758 --> 00:41:29,593
I'm very familiar
with your case.

676
00:41:29,627 --> 00:41:31,695
Telly brought me up to speed.

677
00:41:31,729 --> 00:41:32,731
Where is he?

678
00:41:32,764 --> 00:41:35,666
He's been indicted in
connection to the case.

679
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,402
I suggest we don't
waste any time.

680
00:41:46,446 --> 00:41:47,648
Racketeering, murdering?

681
00:41:47,681 --> 00:41:49,050
This has nothing to do with me.

682
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:50,518
RICO, conspiracy.

683
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:51,592
They're grabbing everyone.

684
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:53,030
And how long is
this going to take?

685
00:41:53,054 --> 00:41:54,064
It could be a couple of years.

686
00:41:54,088 --> 00:41:56,759
What about bail?

687
00:41:56,792 --> 00:41:57,693
Maybe 500.

688
00:41:57,726 --> 00:41:58,894
500,000?

689
00:41:58,928 --> 00:42:00,162
Possibly.

690
00:42:00,196 --> 00:42:00,997
Plus the legal fees?

691
00:42:01,031 --> 00:42:02,499
No, I can shift
costs and billable.

692
00:42:02,532 --> 00:42:03,833
You shift nothing.

693
00:42:05,502 --> 00:42:07,138
I'm not a charity
case. I'll pay it.

694
00:42:07,171 --> 00:42:08,573
It is going to be a fight

695
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:10,541
getting your private
accounts unfrozen.

696
00:42:10,575 --> 00:42:11,810
We got joint accounts.

697
00:42:11,843 --> 00:42:14,313
Yes and I've been
through all of it.

698
00:42:14,346 --> 00:42:16,114
And if we don't
get you out soon,

699
00:42:16,148 --> 00:42:17,550
Kat's going to be in trouble.

700
00:42:26,695 --> 00:42:29,598
Go to the banya
and find Anielka,

701
00:42:31,233 --> 00:42:32,167
ask her to go to the Albanian.

702
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,768
She'll get you paid.

703
00:42:36,005 --> 00:42:37,005
Okay?

704
00:42:42,246 --> 00:42:43,447
Ruslan Arshavsky,

705
00:42:44,881 --> 00:42:47,819
Alexei Shapiro,
Aaron Abromovitz.

706
00:42:47,852 --> 00:42:52,191
43 co-conspirators, I
know only two of them.

707
00:42:52,224 --> 00:42:54,093
Verkovsky, you lent him money.

708
00:42:54,126 --> 00:42:55,761
Yes, for his Internet cafe.

709
00:42:55,794 --> 00:42:58,265
How the fuck does this
make me a murderer?

710
00:42:58,298 --> 00:42:59,766
Verkovsky gave
cover to Arshavsky

711
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:01,635
and Shapiro's group
of Internet scammers.

712
00:43:01,668 --> 00:43:03,604
Because they're his tenants.

713
00:43:03,638 --> 00:43:06,907
They traded cryptocurrency
for stolen credit card numbers.

714
00:43:06,941 --> 00:43:08,509
So?

715
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:10,612
And they were infiltrated
by an FBI informant

716
00:43:10,646 --> 00:43:14,550
named Ilsa Sokolov who was
found dead three weeks ago.

717
00:43:14,584 --> 00:43:16,519
More than 40 stab wounds

718
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:19,522
inflicted by a paring
knife from a cutlery set

719
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:23,627
bought in bulk with Abromovitz's
stolen credit cards.

720
00:43:25,195 --> 00:43:26,865
What do they want from me?

721
00:43:26,898 --> 00:43:27,799
Evidence.

722
00:43:27,832 --> 00:43:29,067
I don't know these people.

723
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,835
You know Verkovsky.

724
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:32,872
And if you can help them
paint him into a corner,

725
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:33,873
then they can turn the heat up

726
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:35,174
on the next guy up the ladder.

727
00:43:36,142 --> 00:43:37,311
What's going on?

728
00:43:37,344 --> 00:43:41,014
One of your client's buddies
just got got in the shower.

729
00:43:41,048 --> 00:43:41,648
You listen to me.

730
00:43:41,682 --> 00:43:43,184
I will work. Hey, hey!

731
00:43:43,217 --> 00:43:44,218
I will work this out.

732
00:43:44,252 --> 00:43:45,253
Keep to yourself.

733
00:43:45,286 --> 00:43:47,655
Listen, go to Anielka.

734
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:49,625
Tell her to feel the Albanian.

735
00:43:49,658 --> 00:43:51,894
I will need a new partner.

736
00:43:51,927 --> 00:43:53,295
Please.

737
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:54,330
Okay.

738
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:12,018
What?

739
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:13,619
You keep texting me

740
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:15,588
about getting comped
bottle service at the club.

741
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:16,255
You're my hookup.

742
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:18,258
I am outta the club scene.

743
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:20,094
100%?

744
00:44:20,127 --> 00:44:21,830
100%.

745
00:44:21,862 --> 00:44:22,563
Out.

746
00:44:22,596 --> 00:44:24,132
Thought you were just playin'.

747
00:44:24,165 --> 00:44:25,165
Mm-hmm.

748
00:44:26,769 --> 00:44:27,769
How's Uncle Vlad?

749
00:44:28,904 --> 00:44:30,807
Under the
circumstances, he's fine.

750
00:44:31,874 --> 00:44:32,843
And you?

751
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:33,875
I'm okay.

752
00:44:36,446 --> 00:44:38,115
We're gonna get
through this together.

753
00:44:41,352 --> 00:44:42,721
You're here for the monthly.

754
00:44:42,755 --> 00:44:44,989
Um, not exactly.

755
00:44:46,325 --> 00:44:49,829
He asked me if you can do half.

756
00:44:49,863 --> 00:44:50,562
Half?

757
00:44:50,596 --> 00:44:51,799
Your balance.

758
00:44:55,135 --> 00:44:56,202
I don't have that here.

759
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:57,405
No, of course not.

760
00:44:57,438 --> 00:45:00,040
But tomorrow,
I'll make it happen.

761
00:45:05,013 --> 00:45:06,181
Thanks.

762
00:45:08,651 --> 00:45:09,651
I'm sorry.

763
00:45:12,756 --> 00:45:13,589
Don't say my name.

764
00:45:13,623 --> 00:45:14,893
How did?

765
00:45:14,925 --> 00:45:15,926
Are you okay?

766
00:45:15,959 --> 00:45:17,060
Yes, I'm fine.

767
00:45:17,094 --> 00:45:18,094
Did you get my message?

768
00:45:19,964 --> 00:45:21,099
I'm with her.

769
00:45:21,132 --> 00:45:23,001
The balance, the
number that I sent you,

770
00:45:23,034 --> 00:45:24,068
that's her balance.

771
00:45:25,404 --> 00:45:27,072
Get half of it.

772
00:45:27,106 --> 00:45:28,507
I understand.

773
00:45:28,541 --> 00:45:29,008
Collect the rest
from all the others.

774
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:30,609
We need all of it.

775
00:45:32,012 --> 00:45:33,012
'Kay.

776
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:34,381
Are you safe?

777
00:45:34,414 --> 00:45:35,515
I'm okay.

778
00:45:35,549 --> 00:45:39,287
I just need to get out of
here as soon as possible.

779
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,321
I will.

780
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:28,545
V, baby!

781
00:46:28,578 --> 00:46:31,681
I am sorry I missed
the grand opening.

782
00:46:31,715 --> 00:46:33,216
Zim, we missed you.

783
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,820
Next one.

784
00:46:34,853 --> 00:46:36,287
Yeah, next one.

785
00:46:37,455 --> 00:46:40,425
Vince at the club
sends his love.

786
00:46:40,459 --> 00:46:41,560
Aww.

787
00:46:41,593 --> 00:46:44,463
And Jojo at Withdrawl asked
me to give you her cell.

788
00:46:44,496 --> 00:46:47,868
I'd love to see Jojo.

789
00:46:47,902 --> 00:46:50,972
I tell 'em, "She's
off chasin' her dreams.

790
00:46:51,006 --> 00:46:51,907
Hit her up on the 'grams.

791
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,207
She got 90,000 followers."

792
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,240
120,000.

793
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:58,346
120,000 followers.

794
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,816
Watch and learn, boys and girls.

795
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:03,787
I mean shit, I own
six nightclubs.

796
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,187
Your family owns them.

797
00:47:05,221 --> 00:47:08,860
Six nightclubs, four
restaurants, one hotel

798
00:47:08,893 --> 00:47:11,361
and I barely get
15,000 followers.

799
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:15,099
We're gonna go grab a
bite with Chuck and Agron.

800
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:16,367
Wanna join?

801
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:18,336
Two cafes and tattoo parlor?

802
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:19,438
No partners.

803
00:47:19,471 --> 00:47:20,372
Wow.

804
00:47:20,406 --> 00:47:21,841
Long hours, but you know.

805
00:47:22,943 --> 00:47:23,943
I know, don't I?

806
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:27,080
Hey, V ever tell you
how we met each other?

807
00:47:29,249 --> 00:47:33,822
V and I dated college
year in freshmen upstate.

808
00:47:33,855 --> 00:47:36,826
After we broke up, she
still needed me for weed

809
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:38,527
and rides back home from school.

810
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,262
So we made an arrangement.

811
00:47:40,295 --> 00:47:41,799
Okay, that's enough.

812
00:47:41,832 --> 00:47:44,835
A dime bag meant a hand job.

813
00:47:44,868 --> 00:47:47,738
Coke was a blow job.

814
00:47:48,873 --> 00:47:51,810
And a ride home, that meant

815
00:47:51,843 --> 00:47:54,747
I was gettin' that
sweet, sweet ass.

816
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:57,248
No strings attached.

817
00:47:57,282 --> 00:47:58,450
You're an asshole.

818
00:47:58,483 --> 00:48:00,653
Her dad disappeared on her

819
00:48:00,686 --> 00:48:02,130
and her mom could
barely pay her rent,

820
00:48:02,154 --> 00:48:03,394
so I guess I get a scholarship.

821
00:48:05,325 --> 00:48:06,560
Get out.

822
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:09,296
Now I don't even
get a return call.

823
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:11,199
I told you I am done.

824
00:48:11,232 --> 00:48:12,200
Done?

825
00:48:12,233 --> 00:48:13,501
Yeah, done.

826
00:48:25,082 --> 00:48:26,282
Bull.

827
00:48:38,463 --> 00:48:39,933
Hey, hey!

828
00:48:52,547 --> 00:48:56,853
Nobody tells me shit since
I'm 14 years old, bitch.

829
00:48:57,319 --> 00:48:59,156
Stay down, Zim.

830
00:48:59,188 --> 00:49:00,456
I'll get ice.

831
00:49:03,027 --> 00:49:06,530
Russian deadbeat dad.

832
00:49:06,563 --> 00:49:07,564
Vetone!

833
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:21,982
The fuck happened?

834
00:49:32,294 --> 00:49:33,129
Hi.

835
00:49:33,162 --> 00:49:35,031
This is our first time.

836
00:49:35,064 --> 00:49:35,866
Oh, wow. First time.

837
00:49:35,899 --> 00:49:37,333
Fuck your mother
with a chainsaw!

838
00:49:37,366 --> 00:49:38,367
Uncle Kos!

839
00:49:38,401 --> 00:49:39,402
Sorry, Katya. Sorry.

840
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:42,673
I have excellent
idea for shark tank.

841
00:49:42,706 --> 00:49:47,913
Website called
kostyakorolneudachi.com.

842
00:49:48,446 --> 00:49:49,547
What does that mean?

843
00:49:49,581 --> 00:49:51,516
Kostya: king of all losers.

844
00:49:51,549 --> 00:49:53,053
Hi banya?

845
00:49:53,086 --> 00:49:54,353
No. No, you didn't leave.

846
00:49:54,386 --> 00:49:56,489
No nothing in lost and
found, no bathing suit.

847
00:49:56,522 --> 00:49:57,958
Don't call bookie this time.

848
00:49:57,991 --> 00:50:00,260
Bet with me on next race.

849
00:50:00,293 --> 00:50:01,028
The seventh?

850
00:50:01,062 --> 00:50:03,131
How much you down today?

851
00:50:03,164 --> 00:50:04,066
500.

852
00:50:04,099 --> 00:50:06,101
I got like 10 bucks left.

853
00:50:06,135 --> 00:50:07,035
Shit.

854
00:50:07,069 --> 00:50:10,039
Okay, I give you 50 to one odds.

855
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:11,273
Any horse you want.

856
00:50:11,306 --> 00:50:13,375
I take the
favorite, number nine.

857
00:50:13,408 --> 00:50:15,946
You could take
Moses riding unicorn

858
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,414
with rocket up its
ass, you'd still lose.

859
00:50:25,056 --> 00:50:25,957
- Vetone.
- Hey.

860
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:28,426
Daniel. Daniel, Vetone.

861
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,262
My pleasure.

862
00:50:29,294 --> 00:50:30,163
Same.

863
00:50:30,196 --> 00:50:31,363
Boxes.

864
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:42,643
Yo, we good?

865
00:50:42,676 --> 00:50:43,946
They behavin'?

866
00:50:43,979 --> 00:50:45,214
Yeah, yeah. They're fine.

867
00:50:45,247 --> 00:50:46,849
I gotta talk to you
about the bills, man.

868
00:50:46,882 --> 00:50:48,322
I don't know how
this place survives.

869
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:49,618
I don't get it.

870
00:50:49,652 --> 00:50:51,097
There's a guy named
Nathan comin' by tonight.

871
00:50:51,121 --> 00:50:52,231
Somethin' I need to worry about?

872
00:50:52,255 --> 00:50:52,989
Nah.

873
00:50:53,023 --> 00:50:54,423
Remember Fat Jack's buildings?

874
00:50:54,456 --> 00:50:55,659
I'm buyin' 'em.

875
00:50:55,692 --> 00:50:57,195
12 mil.

876
00:50:57,228 --> 00:50:59,729
I gave him a higher number,
improvements and whatnot.

877
00:50:59,763 --> 00:51:00,564
How much?

878
00:51:00,597 --> 00:51:01,598
15.

879
00:51:03,135 --> 00:51:05,070
They don't know you're
flippin' the contracts.

880
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,748
That's why I'm gettin'
3 mil in a month.

881
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,107
Shit.

882
00:51:13,047 --> 00:51:15,348
Oh, sorry.

883
00:51:15,381 --> 00:51:16,516
It's my fault.

884
00:51:19,054 --> 00:51:20,354
Hey, who's Vetone?

885
00:51:20,387 --> 00:51:21,488
Family friend.

886
00:51:21,522 --> 00:51:23,191
She's here to help.

887
00:51:23,225 --> 00:51:24,526
How?

888
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:25,594
She owns your father.

889
00:51:27,096 --> 00:51:29,165
I don't think I wanna know then.

890
00:51:29,198 --> 00:51:31,101
I helped her to
fund a coffee shop,

891
00:51:31,134 --> 00:51:34,104
a tattoo parlor and
an online art auction.

892
00:51:35,505 --> 00:51:37,584
Not everyone can walk into
the bank for a business loan.

893
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:39,010
All right, I know. I know.

894
00:51:39,043 --> 00:51:40,386
Pillar of the
community and all that.

895
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:41,779
I get it.

896
00:51:41,814 --> 00:51:43,091
What do you think
of your father?

897
00:51:43,115 --> 00:51:46,619
I think he's running
this place like it's 1978

898
00:51:46,652 --> 00:51:48,721
and I don't know how
he has enough money.

899
00:51:50,156 --> 00:51:52,093
It's enough money to
take care of your mom

900
00:51:52,126 --> 00:51:53,426
for another month or two

901
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,663
and the rest to pay
your father's bail.

902
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:58,267
Yeah, then what?

903
00:51:59,433 --> 00:52:01,736
Can I count on
you to stick around?

904
00:52:01,769 --> 00:52:03,705
Yeah, of course.

905
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:07,776
Just need to go and
make a few deposits.

906
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:09,179
Well I'll go with you.

907
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:12,649
I'm black belt
and kung fu, jujutsu

908
00:52:12,682 --> 00:52:14,484
and the art of seduction.

909
00:52:15,619 --> 00:52:17,155
All Russian women are.

910
00:52:20,525 --> 00:52:24,596
Paulius?

911
00:52:44,321 --> 00:52:45,521
Bank is further down.

912
00:52:46,923 --> 00:52:48,457
Leave the money
here and get out.

913
00:52:50,361 --> 00:52:51,395
What?

914
00:52:51,429 --> 00:52:52,429
Do it now.

915
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:54,699
You fucking kidding me?

916
00:53:00,605 --> 00:53:01,640
Your hand will heal.

917
00:53:03,242 --> 00:53:06,180
If your old man is gone
for good, I've got nothing.

918
00:53:07,181 --> 00:53:08,215
Take a cab.

919
00:53:13,587 --> 00:53:14,587
Get out.

920
00:53:26,103 --> 00:53:30,341
Moshe, rub some on my feet.

921
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,214
Valuables in the box.

922
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:39,517
Is Maxim or Anielka here?

923
00:53:40,487 --> 00:53:41,421
Nathan?

924
00:53:41,454 --> 00:53:42,654
Yeah.

925
00:53:42,688 --> 00:53:43,933
Oh great. Yeah,
please have a seat.

926
00:53:43,957 --> 00:53:45,158
He'll be right back.

927
00:53:51,198 --> 00:53:53,734
Hey Uncle Kos, can you
grab me some change?

928
00:53:53,768 --> 00:53:56,104
What, you don't want
my help, Danetchka?

929
00:53:56,138 --> 00:53:57,316
I thought it was your week off.

930
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,673
I didn't wanna bother you.

931
00:53:58,707 --> 00:53:59,876
After this race.

932
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:00,709
Hey mom, I'm goin' to the back.

933
00:54:00,742 --> 00:54:01,710
I'll be right back.

934
00:54:01,743 --> 00:54:03,347
Just stay here, 'kay?

935
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:05,516
Uncle Kos, keep an
eye on her please.

936
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,321
Hey, you should try it.

937
00:54:11,389 --> 00:54:12,756
I don't have any mud.

938
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:15,593
Why are we hiding up here
like we're skipping home ec?

939
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:19,764
'Cause I don't wanna share
my best shit with everybody.

940
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:20,799
You good?

941
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,700
One more.

942
00:54:30,344 --> 00:54:31,612
What's in there?

943
00:54:31,646 --> 00:54:32,646
Treatment room.

944
00:54:35,017 --> 00:54:36,885
I've known Anielka for years,

945
00:54:36,919 --> 00:54:38,354
yet this is my first time here.

946
00:54:38,388 --> 00:54:42,392
Sure, it's the secret to
a wonderful life, boychik.

947
00:54:42,425 --> 00:54:45,296
What's your game?
- They're closing in, bitch.

948
00:54:45,329 --> 00:54:46,897
Art dealer primarily.

949
00:54:46,931 --> 00:54:48,575
But I'm about to buy
property in the neighborhood.

950
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:49,733
No!

951
00:54:49,767 --> 00:54:51,602
- Where?
- Yes, yes, yes!

952
00:54:51,635 --> 00:54:52,803
Mother fuck!

953
00:54:52,838 --> 00:54:54,273
Down the way on Delancey.

954
00:54:54,307 --> 00:54:55,607
Really?

955
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,640
How much?

956
00:55:20,904 --> 00:55:22,205
What happened?

957
00:55:25,009 --> 00:55:26,743
I just fall and twisted it.

958
00:55:26,776 --> 00:55:27,478
Come, sit down.

959
00:55:27,512 --> 00:55:29,281
Can you get her some ice please?

960
00:55:31,716 --> 00:55:32,716
Lemme see.

961
00:55:35,821 --> 00:55:39,827
Are you all right?

962
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:40,961
Are you okay?

963
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:44,773
We should get her to a hospital.

964
00:55:44,797 --> 00:55:46,868
Yeah, good idea.

965
00:55:46,902 --> 00:55:48,003
Can you get her a car?

966
00:55:49,504 --> 00:55:50,504
Yeah.

967
00:55:59,016 --> 00:55:59,950
Lemme see this.

968
00:55:59,983 --> 00:56:01,251
I just twisted it.

969
00:56:02,587 --> 00:56:03,587
Paulius?

970
00:56:04,489 --> 00:56:05,789
Paulius did this to you?

971
00:56:07,425 --> 00:56:09,694
Just say the word and I'll
get your money back, baby.

972
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,795
He robbed you?

973
00:56:15,869 --> 00:56:17,803
My father's bail money.

974
00:56:24,679 --> 00:56:27,049
V?

975
00:56:27,082 --> 00:56:28,082
Yeah, baby.

976
00:56:30,785 --> 00:56:31,786
Okay.

977
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:34,557
I'm comin' with you.

978
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,662
Are you sure you wanna do that?

979
00:57:24,182 --> 00:57:26,551
We're gonna give
her a few minutes.

980
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:30,690
When she drops her key
card, that's the signal.

981
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,560
What this guy do?

982
00:57:36,897 --> 00:57:38,432
Cheated on my girl.

983
00:58:22,184 --> 00:58:23,184
Wait.

984
00:58:32,596 --> 00:58:37,502
Do you like fucking with
people that are weaker than you?

985
00:58:39,137 --> 00:58:40,872
Poor baby. So powerless.

986
00:58:45,211 --> 00:58:47,012
And you have a gun in your hand.

987
00:58:51,151 --> 00:58:52,953
But I still win.

988
00:59:11,976 --> 00:59:13,010
What the fuck?

989
00:59:17,682 --> 00:59:19,718
He doesn't have
the money with him.

990
00:59:21,687 --> 00:59:23,055
He's gonna lead us to it.

991
00:59:41,977 --> 00:59:42,977
Boom!

992
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:49,986
Prince Danetchka, this is
from Maxim, me and your aunt.

993
00:59:50,021 --> 00:59:50,988
Say spasíba.

994
00:59:51,022 --> 00:59:52,490
Spasíba.

995
00:59:52,523 --> 00:59:55,593
Aww, sorry
Maxim couldn't be here.

996
00:59:55,626 --> 00:59:58,597
He's still on antibiotics
and needs to rest, hmm?

997
00:59:59,631 --> 01:00:00,631
I know.

998
01:00:01,634 --> 01:00:04,604
Come.

999
01:00:04,637 --> 01:00:06,306
I think I may have way out.

1000
01:00:07,241 --> 01:00:09,243
What do you mean?

1001
01:00:09,276 --> 01:00:10,177
- Kostya!
- Hey!

1002
01:00:10,211 --> 01:00:13,014
Where's the birthday boy?

1003
01:00:13,048 --> 01:00:14,951
How you doing, buddy?

1004
01:00:14,983 --> 01:00:15,750
- Good.
- Yeah?

1005
01:00:15,784 --> 01:00:17,586
It's good birthday?

1006
01:00:17,619 --> 01:00:19,755
Just so many adults here, right?

1007
01:00:19,789 --> 01:00:21,257
And nobody is interested

1008
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:24,194
in the same things you
are interested in, right?

1009
01:00:24,228 --> 01:00:25,964
Yeah. Right.

1010
01:00:25,996 --> 01:00:27,264
Okay.

1011
01:00:27,297 --> 01:00:29,099
So I think I have the cure.

1012
01:00:33,638 --> 01:00:36,242
An Apple lie Plus?

1013
01:00:36,275 --> 01:00:37,710
Awesome!

1014
01:00:37,743 --> 01:00:38,979
Can I plug it in?

1015
01:00:39,011 --> 01:00:40,881
You plug it in when you get home

1016
01:00:40,914 --> 01:00:42,950
and with your father, okay?

1017
01:00:42,984 --> 01:00:44,417
- Okay.
- Okay.

1018
01:00:44,451 --> 01:00:46,586
Danetchka. Happy
birthday, big boy.

1019
01:00:49,925 --> 01:00:51,158
Kostya.

1020
01:00:51,192 --> 01:00:52,360
Kotya, that's too much.

1021
01:00:52,393 --> 01:00:53,362
We can't.

1022
01:00:53,395 --> 01:00:54,964
What? I had a good year.

1023
01:00:54,998 --> 01:00:55,831
Come on.

1024
01:00:55,864 --> 01:00:57,901
I thought you said
market was down.

1025
01:00:57,934 --> 01:00:59,904
Up, down. Does it matter?

1026
01:01:00,703 --> 01:01:02,639
Just need to be on the
right side of trade.

1027
01:01:04,241 --> 01:01:05,709
How's Maxim?

1028
01:01:05,743 --> 01:01:07,012
Oh, you know kids.

1029
01:01:07,044 --> 01:01:08,646
Resilient.

1030
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:09,714
He'll be okay.

1031
01:01:11,683 --> 01:01:13,953
But those bastards
from Brighton beach,

1032
01:01:13,986 --> 01:01:15,621
can't get them off our backs.

1033
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:18,824
What did you guys do?

1034
01:01:18,858 --> 01:01:21,328
We borrowed some money.

1035
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:23,932
Are you behind them payments?

1036
01:01:23,965 --> 01:01:24,364
No.

1037
01:01:24,398 --> 01:01:25,465
No, no.

1038
01:01:25,499 --> 01:01:29,270
It's just now they think
that they're our partners

1039
01:01:29,304 --> 01:01:31,272
because we owe them the money.

1040
01:01:31,306 --> 01:01:32,943
How much is the note for?

1041
01:01:32,976 --> 01:01:36,745
It's for $100,000 plus
the deed to the banya.

1042
01:01:37,813 --> 01:01:39,382
How much is the bank loan?

1043
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:41,284
No, there's no bank loan.

1044
01:01:41,318 --> 01:01:43,020
It's just them.

1045
01:01:43,054 --> 01:01:44,155
100,000.

1046
01:01:44,188 --> 01:01:45,188
Yes.

1047
01:01:48,459 --> 01:01:51,763
What percentage of this
business you give me today

1048
01:01:52,764 --> 01:01:54,800
if I pay it off?

1049
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:55,970
What?

1050
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:58,671
You gonna pay $100,000 today?

1051
01:01:59,907 --> 01:02:00,907
Yes.

1052
01:02:33,379 --> 01:02:35,082
This is very early, gentlemen.

1053
01:02:38,718 --> 01:02:40,956
We wanted to thank
you for your generosity.

1054
01:02:40,989 --> 01:02:42,323
The business is doing great

1055
01:02:44,158 --> 01:02:46,929
and we wanted to pay off
the loan, make you full.

1056
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:48,196
Um no.

1057
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:49,798
Um, make you whole.

1058
01:02:49,831 --> 01:02:51,433
Full, what the fuck?

1059
01:02:51,466 --> 01:02:54,104
This loan should've taken
10 years to pay off.

1060
01:02:54,138 --> 01:02:57,041
We calculated your lost interest

1061
01:02:57,074 --> 01:02:58,809
and paid you for five years.

1062
01:03:01,478 --> 01:03:03,081
I can't help but think

1063
01:03:03,114 --> 01:03:06,118
that this is due to my
nephew's ambitious techniques.

1064
01:03:07,852 --> 01:03:09,355
He told me what
happened with the boys

1065
01:03:09,388 --> 01:03:10,723
and that it was accident.

1066
01:03:12,892 --> 01:03:14,193
Your generation,

1067
01:03:16,064 --> 01:03:18,298
the necessary risk you take.

1068
01:03:33,117 --> 01:03:34,117
Wait.

1069
01:03:35,752 --> 01:03:39,091
We wanted to pay you
while we had the money.

1070
01:03:39,124 --> 01:03:41,292
In any event, we look forward

1071
01:03:41,325 --> 01:03:43,963
to doing business with
you again in near future.

1072
01:03:49,469 --> 01:03:50,436
Receipts.

1073
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:52,072
I be right back, okay?

1074
01:04:20,139 --> 01:04:21,139
Oh.

1075
01:04:22,473 --> 01:04:23,408
Dad?

1076
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:24,244
Yeah?

1077
01:04:24,276 --> 01:04:25,276
Are we safe now?

1078
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:28,081
Yes, we're safe.

1079
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:32,253
Uncle Kostya said those
men won't come back.

1080
01:04:34,354 --> 01:04:35,355
No, they won't.

1081
01:04:36,992 --> 01:04:38,927
We're cleaning up the
neighborhood, remember?

1082
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:52,277
Next time, mind
your fuckin' business.

1083
01:04:54,444 --> 01:04:55,947
Pick him up.
- Get up.

1084
01:05:29,954 --> 01:05:31,121
Yeah, I know but.

1085
01:05:31,155 --> 01:05:35,093
Katya.

1086
01:05:38,931 --> 01:05:39,966
I miss you.

1087
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:46,039
Ma, who're you talkin' to?

1088
01:05:55,317 --> 01:05:56,352
Hello?

1089
01:05:56,384 --> 01:05:58,419
Don't say my name.

1090
01:05:58,453 --> 01:06:00,257
Just listen.

1091
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,259
I might not be able
to talk to you again.

1092
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:07,696
Daniel.

1093
01:06:09,133 --> 01:06:10,968
I'm very proud of you.

1094
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:14,139
I just can't believe

1095
01:06:14,172 --> 01:06:16,375
we managed to raise
such beautiful person.

1096
01:06:17,442 --> 01:06:18,144
Dad, I love you.

1097
01:06:18,177 --> 01:06:19,379
I love you too, son.

1098
01:06:19,411 --> 01:06:20,731
- Yeah.
- I'll see you soon, 'kay?

1099
01:06:29,357 --> 01:06:32,060
Did you think about what
I asked you last night?

1100
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:35,030
The loan.

1101
01:06:36,531 --> 01:06:37,465
It's just for a few days.

1102
01:06:37,499 --> 01:06:39,077
You know I can't
access that kinda money

1103
01:06:39,101 --> 01:06:40,603
without it raisin' a red flag.

1104
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:46,710
Hey, come on.

1105
01:06:49,746 --> 01:06:51,050
It's gonna be okay.

1106
01:06:56,088 --> 01:06:58,024
Let's talk about this
room full of amazing work

1107
01:06:58,058 --> 01:06:59,125
you won't let anyone see.

1108
01:07:01,094 --> 01:07:02,094
I'm not ready.

1109
01:07:03,097 --> 01:07:05,032
So you say.

1110
01:07:05,066 --> 01:07:06,666
Are you just
changing the subject?

1111
01:07:07,701 --> 01:07:10,105
You should at least let me
get you up in another gallery.

1112
01:07:10,138 --> 01:07:11,039
When I'm ready.

1113
01:07:11,073 --> 01:07:12,341
And when's that gonna be?

1114
01:07:12,374 --> 01:07:13,374
When I am.

1115
01:07:15,144 --> 01:07:16,144
It's a shame.

1116
01:07:18,948 --> 01:07:20,550
So when is your
divorce happening?

1117
01:07:21,517 --> 01:07:22,517
Timing

1118
01:07:24,321 --> 01:07:25,322
is bad.

1119
01:07:26,391 --> 01:07:28,559
Timing's been bad for two years.

1120
01:07:28,592 --> 01:07:30,428
I can say the same
about your work.

1121
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:38,304
Hey.

1122
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,075
I have to make a
breakfast meeting.

1123
01:07:50,152 --> 01:07:51,686
Tell Maxim he owes me a call.

1124
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:08,539
Hello Vetone?

1125
01:08:08,572 --> 01:08:10,342
Yeah, it's Anielka.

1126
01:08:12,811 --> 01:08:14,946
We have a problem.

1127
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:25,160
What?

1128
01:08:25,193 --> 01:08:26,504
Can you get something
for me from the outside?

1129
01:08:26,528 --> 01:08:28,531
Yeah, size?

1130
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:29,798
It's a SIM card.

1131
01:08:29,831 --> 01:08:31,100
Yeah, got fresh papers?

1132
01:08:32,268 --> 01:08:33,035
It'll cost you double.

1133
01:08:33,069 --> 01:08:35,205
- No problem.
- 10th Street, right?

1134
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,408
Goddamn, man.
- What?

1135
01:08:38,442 --> 01:08:40,211
You drink too
much fuckin' coffee.

1136
01:08:40,244 --> 01:08:41,245
What do you mean?

1137
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:42,447
This tastes like shit.

1138
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,847
Oh, literally?

1139
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:44,881
Yeah, literally.

1140
01:08:46,218 --> 01:08:47,453
What the fuck you lookin' at?

1141
01:08:54,494 --> 01:08:55,562
Break it up!

1142
01:08:55,594 --> 01:08:57,331
Break it

1143
01:08:57,364 --> 01:08:58,399
up!

1144
01:08:58,432 --> 01:08:59,842
All right, let's see
how you two shit bags

1145
01:08:59,866 --> 01:09:01,135
like a night in the hole.

1146
01:09:11,913 --> 01:09:13,350
How the fuck did you find me?

1147
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:18,122
I stopped by your cafe.

1148
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:22,327
Caught someone that
didn't recognize you?

1149
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,229
Yeah, I suppose.

1150
01:09:26,265 --> 01:09:27,366
What are you doing here?

1151
01:09:28,567 --> 01:09:30,236
Is this how you
greet your father?

1152
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:36,410
You are nothing to me.

1153
01:09:36,444 --> 01:09:40,248
I've thought about you every
day for the last 15 years.

1154
01:09:40,281 --> 01:09:43,252
Not enough to cut your
bullshit when I needed you most.

1155
01:09:43,285 --> 01:09:44,719
I've come to tell you I'm sorry.

1156
01:09:44,752 --> 01:09:45,863
And I'm in the
middle of something.

1157
01:09:45,887 --> 01:09:50,260
So if you wanna play your
imaginary reconciliation,

1158
01:09:50,293 --> 01:09:51,294
it's gonna have to wait.

1159
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:54,565
I was selfish,

1160
01:09:55,533 --> 01:09:58,869
but you're goin' to need
me now more than ever.

1161
01:09:58,903 --> 01:09:59,903
Need you?

1162
01:10:01,672 --> 01:10:04,142
I never needed you.

1163
01:10:04,176 --> 01:10:06,179
Not even after what
you did yesterday?

1164
01:10:07,346 --> 01:10:09,315
A mutual friend
brought your name up

1165
01:10:09,348 --> 01:10:12,352
in connection to a missing
Albanian club owner.

1166
01:10:16,457 --> 01:10:17,358
I don't know what you mean.

1167
01:10:17,392 --> 01:10:18,432
Don't lie to me, Vetone.

1168
01:10:19,527 --> 01:10:21,196
I am the only one
who can help you now.

1169
01:10:25,534 --> 01:10:26,669
Huh?

1170
01:10:26,701 --> 01:10:28,572
You do everything
I tell you to do.

1171
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:33,944
And why would I do that?

1172
01:10:33,977 --> 01:10:35,745
Because I can still save you,

1173
01:10:35,779 --> 01:10:37,948
even though I haven't
been a father to you.

1174
01:10:39,717 --> 01:10:40,885
And if I don't?

1175
01:10:43,288 --> 01:10:44,557
You will lose everything

1176
01:10:48,461 --> 01:10:51,398
and I will lose the only
thing that ever mattered.

1177
01:10:55,636 --> 01:10:56,636
Wait.

1178
01:11:18,296 --> 01:11:20,366
I will need you.

1179
01:11:38,487 --> 01:11:39,588
So what did I miss?

1180
01:11:39,621 --> 01:11:41,023
Miss?

1181
01:11:41,056 --> 01:11:42,791
I'm just getting
warmed up, Junior.

1182
01:11:42,824 --> 01:11:44,460
So how we doin'?

1183
01:11:44,494 --> 01:11:45,671
Are you ready to turn
over the files this week?

1184
01:11:45,695 --> 01:11:47,464
Boychik, I gotta hand it to you.

1185
01:11:47,498 --> 01:11:49,366
You outdid yourself.

1186
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,301
With what?

1187
01:11:50,334 --> 01:11:52,870
15 million is a great price.

1188
01:11:52,903 --> 01:11:54,905
- Huh?
- What price?

1189
01:11:54,938 --> 01:11:56,775
My buildings on Delancey.

1190
01:11:56,807 --> 01:11:58,411
15 mil, what are
you talkin' about?

1191
01:11:58,444 --> 01:11:59,045
The deal's for 12.

1192
01:11:59,078 --> 01:12:00,012
No, no, no.

1193
01:12:00,046 --> 01:12:02,315
That's when you were with Vlad.

1194
01:12:02,348 --> 01:12:06,720
But you brought in Nathan
for 15, he told me.

1195
01:12:07,987 --> 01:12:09,724
You and Vlad?

1196
01:12:09,757 --> 01:12:10,991
You and Vlad?

1197
01:12:11,025 --> 01:12:12,460
Ah, take it easy, Pavel.

1198
01:12:12,493 --> 01:12:15,631
No, that cocksucker won't
talk to me for 15 years

1199
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:17,566
and you are buying
property with him?

1200
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:19,001
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1201
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:21,037
Maxim brokered the deal.

1202
01:12:22,405 --> 01:12:24,674
Kiddo, I'm going to
pay you a commission.

1203
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:25,675
Don't worry.

1204
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:27,078
Let's say um,

1205
01:12:28,012 --> 01:12:28,978
30,000.

1206
01:12:29,013 --> 01:12:30,448
30,000?

1207
01:12:30,481 --> 01:12:32,417
"Hey, thank you,
Moshe."

1208
01:12:32,451 --> 01:12:34,386
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

1209
01:12:35,754 --> 01:12:36,588
Hey.

1210
01:12:36,621 --> 01:12:38,124
Come back, you bastard.

1211
01:12:38,157 --> 01:12:38,957
Come back here.

1212
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:43,764
I'm going to kiss you.

1213
01:12:48,769 --> 01:12:49,970
Hey.

1214
01:12:50,003 --> 01:12:51,939
Hey. Kostya, right?

1215
01:12:51,972 --> 01:12:53,108
Yeah.

1216
01:12:53,141 --> 01:12:54,776
What you up to, Uncle Kos?

1217
01:12:54,809 --> 01:12:55,845
Nothing.

1218
01:12:55,877 --> 01:12:58,047
We're headin' over to the Baths.

1219
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,648
Oh, maybe I meet you later.

1220
01:12:59,682 --> 01:13:00,616
Okay.

1221
01:13:00,649 --> 01:13:02,552
We're gonna chip in
in the first at Belmont.

1222
01:13:03,919 --> 01:13:04,621
Are you in?

1223
01:13:04,654 --> 01:13:05,921
My uncle, he's a trainer.

1224
01:13:05,955 --> 01:13:07,425
Six to one. It's a lock.

1225
01:13:08,459 --> 01:13:10,395
I won 20 grand last time.

1226
01:13:11,562 --> 01:13:14,099
Going for 40 today.

1227
01:13:14,133 --> 01:13:15,900
Okay, maybe one race.

1228
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:17,069
Attaboy.

1229
01:13:17,102 --> 01:13:17,770
- All right.
- Oh yeah.

1230
01:13:17,803 --> 01:13:19,172
Let's go.

1231
01:13:45,836 --> 01:13:48,139
What the fucks are you doing?

1232
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:49,407
Get the fuck out of here.

1233
01:14:21,645 --> 01:14:22,813
Baby, what's wrong?

1234
01:14:31,556 --> 01:14:32,557
What's wrong?

1235
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:41,602
Have fun.

1236
01:14:49,245 --> 01:14:50,245
Hi Maxim.

1237
01:14:58,655 --> 01:14:59,655
V, got a sec?

1238
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:01,291
Is she good?

1239
01:15:02,827 --> 01:15:03,895
Nah.

1240
01:15:03,928 --> 01:15:05,696
No, maybe we should
hang out later.

1241
01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:06,765
Give it another shot.

1242
01:15:08,166 --> 01:15:09,635
Are you coked up?

1243
01:15:09,668 --> 01:15:10,668
No, I'm fine.

1244
01:15:39,136 --> 01:15:40,305
Where you goin'?

1245
01:15:40,338 --> 01:15:41,573
Bathroom. My meds.

1246
01:15:41,606 --> 01:15:42,674
Leave the bag.

1247
01:15:42,707 --> 01:15:43,174
We'll watch it.

1248
01:15:43,207 --> 01:15:44,876
I have to change.

1249
01:15:44,909 --> 01:15:45,909
Come on.

1250
01:16:12,008 --> 01:16:13,008
Hey.

1251
01:16:17,348 --> 01:16:18,983
I really need to lay down.

1252
01:16:19,016 --> 01:16:20,017
Sure.

1253
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:48,050
Hey.

1254
01:16:48,785 --> 01:16:50,654
Thanks for doin' this.

1255
01:16:50,687 --> 01:16:53,289
I mean I feel as if
she were my own mom.

1256
01:16:54,892 --> 01:16:55,892
Yeah.

1257
01:16:57,595 --> 01:16:59,206
You look like you
haven't slept in a week.

1258
01:16:59,230 --> 01:17:00,231
Are you okay?

1259
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:02,900
Yeah.

1260
01:17:06,773 --> 01:17:07,773
I really like this one.

1261
01:17:10,276 --> 01:17:13,714
Nathan and V are always
trying to get me to exhibit.

1262
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:17,852
Whenever you're ready.

1263
01:17:17,886 --> 01:17:18,886
Yes.

1264
01:17:25,194 --> 01:17:26,362
What's this?

1265
01:17:27,863 --> 01:17:29,167
This is my signature.

1266
01:17:33,971 --> 01:17:34,971
It's

1267
01:17:37,142 --> 01:17:38,142
beautiful.

1268
01:18:05,875 --> 01:18:07,443
14 years in the making.

1269
01:18:22,095 --> 01:18:23,095
I'm sorry.

1270
01:18:24,764 --> 01:18:26,333
No, I'm sorry.

1271
01:18:26,366 --> 01:18:27,334
I should go.

1272
01:18:27,367 --> 01:18:29,103
Sure, sure.

1273
01:18:30,537 --> 01:18:35,009
But just let me know when
Vetone gets back to you

1274
01:18:35,042 --> 01:18:38,781
and I think we just need
to get him out today.

1275
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:39,848
'Course.

1276
01:18:46,923 --> 01:18:48,893
I'm gonna make it happen.

1277
01:19:04,844 --> 01:19:06,480
Hey, come on.

1278
01:19:06,513 --> 01:19:07,815
The race starts in 10 minutes.

1279
01:19:07,848 --> 01:19:09,250
Let's get some quick heat in.

1280
01:19:09,284 --> 01:19:13,822
All right.

1281
01:19:13,855 --> 01:19:15,356
Oh, I gotta make a phone call.

1282
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:16,392
I'll be right down.

1283
01:19:17,726 --> 01:19:19,929
Just you and me, old man.

1284
01:19:25,068 --> 01:19:26,068
Hey.

1285
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:48,334
Who we like in the first race?

1286
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:51,937
C'mon.

1287
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:53,004
You gotta have a tip.

1288
01:20:54,241 --> 01:20:56,042
You're not gonna
tell me who we have?

1289
01:20:57,110 --> 01:20:59,079
What do you got? Come on.

1290
01:21:16,267 --> 01:21:17,267
Open it.

1291
01:21:18,202 --> 01:21:19,202
Open it.

1292
01:21:21,973 --> 01:21:24,075
You got three options.

1293
01:21:24,109 --> 01:21:26,644
One, I tell Vlad everything.

1294
01:21:26,677 --> 01:21:30,082
Maybe he takes some pity on
you, but I wouldn't count on it.

1295
01:21:30,116 --> 01:21:31,284
Two,

1296
01:21:31,317 --> 01:21:34,388
we drive you to the middle of
the woods and you disappear.

1297
01:21:35,688 --> 01:21:37,291
My personal favorite.

1298
01:21:38,959 --> 01:21:40,694
You sell your piece
of the Baths to me

1299
01:21:40,728 --> 01:21:42,629
and our secret stays a secret.

1300
01:21:44,031 --> 01:21:45,700
The drugs are yours.

1301
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:48,337
Should net you enough money
to pay off your bookies.

1302
01:21:52,309 --> 01:21:53,309
Hey.

1303
01:21:54,444 --> 01:21:55,444
D, come sit.

1304
01:22:05,324 --> 01:22:06,458
We good?

1305
01:22:06,492 --> 01:22:07,559
We're good. Relax.

1306
01:22:08,594 --> 01:22:09,594
Then what?

1307
01:22:11,398 --> 01:22:13,600
We stopped by his
apartment this morning.

1308
01:22:13,633 --> 01:22:15,001
He must've forgot it there.

1309
01:22:18,407 --> 01:22:20,641
Kostya, tell him
about the other thing.

1310
01:22:23,577 --> 01:22:25,114
I'm gonna retire

1311
01:22:25,148 --> 01:22:28,550
and V's gonna buy my
piece of the business.

1312
01:22:38,629 --> 01:22:40,231
Excuse us a second.

1313
01:22:40,265 --> 01:22:41,266
C'mon.

1314
01:22:42,401 --> 01:22:43,401
Let's talk.

1315
01:22:51,178 --> 01:22:52,279
Get the fuck over here.

1316
01:22:52,312 --> 01:22:53,481
Why?

1317
01:22:53,514 --> 01:22:55,048
Danetchka.

1318
01:22:55,082 --> 01:22:57,485
My father's life for what?

1319
01:22:59,053 --> 01:23:00,389
For what? Answer me!

1320
01:23:04,561 --> 01:23:05,561
How could you?

1321
01:23:07,464 --> 01:23:08,697
You're pathetic.

1322
01:23:19,810 --> 01:23:22,013
Get the fuck outta here.

1323
01:23:23,815 --> 01:23:25,218
Don't ever come back here again.

1324
01:23:28,222 --> 01:23:30,190
I don't know you anymore.

1325
01:23:48,145 --> 01:23:48,777
Daniel.

1326
01:23:48,811 --> 01:23:50,113
Yeah.

1327
01:23:50,148 --> 01:23:51,148
Lawyer.

1328
01:23:52,816 --> 01:23:53,816
Everything okay?

1329
01:23:57,722 --> 01:23:59,424
Yeah, I'm on my way.

1330
01:23:59,458 --> 01:24:00,492
Thanks.

1331
01:24:29,327 --> 01:24:31,895
Danetchka.

1332
01:24:31,929 --> 01:24:33,298
You got it, Pop.

1333
01:24:34,765 --> 01:24:38,637
Thank you.

1334
01:24:39,837 --> 01:24:41,141
Yeah.

1335
01:24:41,174 --> 01:24:42,841
- Thank you.
- You got it.

1336
01:24:42,875 --> 01:24:43,677
You got it.

1337
01:24:43,709 --> 01:24:44,743
You okay?

1338
01:24:44,777 --> 01:24:45,777
- Yeah.
- You all right?

1339
01:24:51,285 --> 01:24:53,522
Dad, you don't have to thank me.

1340
01:24:53,555 --> 01:24:58,126
Nah, I never intended
for this to happen.

1341
01:24:59,195 --> 01:25:01,129
My problems to
become your problems.

1342
01:25:04,801 --> 01:25:05,669
Oh no, no, no.

1343
01:25:05,703 --> 01:25:07,271
Take that.

1344
01:25:07,304 --> 01:25:09,541
Take that and take care
of the people in Newark.

1345
01:25:09,574 --> 01:25:10,175
No, it's okay.

1346
01:25:10,208 --> 01:25:10,741
I'm here with you guys.

1347
01:25:10,774 --> 01:25:12,277
Daniel, it's not okay.

1348
01:25:14,078 --> 01:25:15,290
I was supposed to
take care of you,

1349
01:25:15,314 --> 01:25:16,382
not the other way around.

1350
01:25:17,617 --> 01:25:18,950
Listen.

1351
01:25:18,984 --> 01:25:20,786
Hey, I'll be fine.

1352
01:25:21,954 --> 01:25:22,954
Just go to Newark.

1353
01:25:25,925 --> 01:25:26,926
Katya.

1354
01:25:27,828 --> 01:25:28,829
Katyusha.

1355
01:25:40,876 --> 01:25:41,810
Oh my god, thank you.

1356
01:25:41,844 --> 01:25:43,947
Welcome back home.

1357
01:25:43,980 --> 01:25:44,980
Thank you.

1358
01:25:48,953 --> 01:25:50,455
Daniel, go.

1359
01:25:50,489 --> 01:25:51,690
Go!

1360
01:25:51,723 --> 01:25:52,723
Seriously, go.

1361
01:25:57,263 --> 01:25:58,264
Do you have to go?

1362
01:25:59,432 --> 01:26:01,235
Yeah, just a couple hours.

1363
01:26:01,934 --> 01:26:03,936
Maybe just stick around here.

1364
01:26:03,970 --> 01:26:05,306
We could have something to eat.

1365
01:26:06,608 --> 01:26:07,608
Yeah.

1366
01:26:09,311 --> 01:26:11,212
Listen, how well
do you know Vetone?

1367
01:26:13,683 --> 01:26:14,683
Why?

1368
01:26:16,686 --> 01:26:17,721
You know what?

1369
01:26:17,754 --> 01:26:18,754
Never mind.

1370
01:26:19,955 --> 01:26:20,856
Another time.

1371
01:26:20,890 --> 01:26:22,459
Tonight we have dinner, yeah?

1372
01:26:22,492 --> 01:26:23,493
Sure.

1373
01:26:27,898 --> 01:26:28,899
I'll be back soon.

1374
01:26:47,589 --> 01:26:48,623
Ivan.

1375
01:26:48,657 --> 01:26:49,657
Welcome home.

1376
01:26:50,726 --> 01:26:51,727
Thank you.

1377
01:26:55,498 --> 01:26:56,498
Ooh.

1378
01:27:00,304 --> 01:27:01,304
To family.

1379
01:27:10,616 --> 01:27:14,454
Mmm.

1380
01:27:14,488 --> 01:27:16,390
Hey dad, one more
thing I wanted to-

1381
01:27:19,626 --> 01:27:20,428
Danetchka?

1382
01:27:20,461 --> 01:27:22,296
Prince Danetchka.

1383
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:23,631
How long has it been?

1384
01:27:23,664 --> 01:27:24,664
Long enough.

1385
01:27:26,468 --> 01:27:27,935
Ivan is a friend now, Daniel.

1386
01:27:27,969 --> 01:27:29,738
I come in peace.

1387
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,843
I'll explain it to you.

1388
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:39,850
Danetchka, you look like ghost.

1389
01:27:41,385 --> 01:27:42,888
Oh.
- Pavel.

1390
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,356
Nice to see you.

1391
01:27:44,389 --> 01:27:45,757
- You too.
- Mr. Ivan.

1392
01:27:48,125 --> 01:27:49,529
Nostrovya.

1393
01:27:49,562 --> 01:27:52,765
Nostrovya.

1394
01:27:59,373 --> 01:28:00,408
Is Ivan here?

1395
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:01,442
I am Ivan.

1396
01:28:05,514 --> 01:28:06,348
- Hey.
- Hey.

1397
01:28:06,382 --> 01:28:07,726
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What're you doin'?

1398
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:08,551
You wanna hear a funny story?

1399
01:28:08,584 --> 01:28:09,785
Sure.

1400
01:28:09,819 --> 01:28:11,488
My young brother
Zim goes missing

1401
01:28:11,521 --> 01:28:13,757
after he goes chasing some
hooker he used to fuck.

1402
01:28:15,392 --> 01:28:16,626
We don't know shit.

1403
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:18,529
All of a sudden I get
a phone call from you

1404
01:28:18,563 --> 01:28:19,963
tellin' me you know where he is.

1405
01:28:19,996 --> 01:28:21,097
That's right.

1406
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:23,501
So where is he?

1407
01:28:26,205 --> 01:28:28,341
I can tell you
where his body is.

1408
01:28:29,676 --> 01:28:30,676
His body?

1409
01:28:32,044 --> 01:28:33,948
Bergen field Park, New Jersey.

1410
01:28:35,583 --> 01:28:39,487
You drive exactly 1.2
miles into the park,

1411
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,389
then you go into the
woods on your left.

1412
01:28:42,524 --> 01:28:43,391
You'll see a large pine

1413
01:28:43,425 --> 01:28:46,462
with your brother's
tongue nailed to it.

1414
01:28:46,496 --> 01:28:47,597
That's where he's buried.

1415
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:49,998
How do you know
he's buried there?

1416
01:28:50,031 --> 01:28:51,835
I'm the one who put him there.

1417
01:28:51,869 --> 01:28:52,870
Can we talk?

1418
01:28:52,903 --> 01:28:53,837
- Shut the fuck up!
- No, no, no, no.

1419
01:28:53,871 --> 01:28:55,037
It's okay.

1420
01:28:55,071 --> 01:28:56,038
- Just talk.
- It's okay.

1421
01:28:56,072 --> 01:28:57,642
I'm the one who killed him.

1422
01:28:57,675 --> 01:28:58,877
Ivan.

1423
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:01,111
No one else here had
anything to do with it.

1424
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:02,815
Ivan.

1425
01:29:02,848 --> 01:29:03,848
No witnesses.

1426
01:29:05,184 --> 01:29:10,390
Daniel.
