1
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,832
THE ABUSIVE PRlNCE

2
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:35,582
Once upon a time

3
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:39,582
there was a princess
who made her people dream.

4
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:43,790
That was Grandmother...
and these are articles about her.

5
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:55,207
And these
are articles about Mother.

6
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:02,165
This...
is the article about me.

7
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,374
PRINCESS FALLS

8
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,207
Why don't people consider me?

9
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:10,415
Good question.
Answer that, Chamberlain.

10
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:15,749
Your Majesty, Highness,
l don't read the tabloids,

11
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,790
but it seems that today's
fairytale princesses

12
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:22,874
have been replaced by starlets,
show girls,

13
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,999
and even squalid call Girls.

14
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:31,499
Letizia, l understand you,
l too would like to be famous,

15
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:36,415
siGn autoGraphs, be on TV,
in "DancinG with the Stars".

16
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:40,290
Not me, all l want is
to raise money for charity.

17
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,332
Grandmother opened
four hospitals in Africa,

18
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:47,040
mother, three schools,
me...

19
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:51,082
a shed with two veterinarians,
because no one knows me.

20
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,165
Then marry Gherets,

21
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,332
he loves you,
he's the Prince of BelGium,

22
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,749
then you'll get in all the papers.

23
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,207
Not to infrinGe on your matters
of the heart, but...

24
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,582
No...

25
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,749
Dad, you just want to do business
with the KinG of BelGium.

26
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,540
But there's no chemistry
with Gherets.

27
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,790
And he has Giant ears.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,249
He does?
l've never noticed them.

29
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,707
Your Gaze is as pure
as a Polynesian sea

30
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:30,082
- and deserves a Gift.
- Thank you.

31
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,332
This gadget is a "must".

32
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,749
- A mirror!
- No, no.

33
00:03:36,958 --> 00:03:40,374
lt's notjust a simple mirror,
it's the i-Mirror.

34
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,999
- The i-Mirror.
- Ask a question.

35
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,415
- To whom?
- The mirror.

36
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:50,582
- How do l look? - You're
the fairest in the kingdom.

37
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,249
And you can even chanGe
the language.

38
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,832
- lt works!
- Who sells this stuff?

39
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:06,165
No one, I patented it, to make
a splash in the new economy.

40
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,374
- Good.
- Thank you.

41
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,290
- Do me a favor?
- Of course.

42
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,415
l left my fan in the tower,
would you Get it for me?

43
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,082
l'd scale Mt. Everest for you.

44
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,207
- Your HiGhness...
- My dear Gherets...

45
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:25,415
- Dad, have you thouGht
about my problem? - Of course!

46
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:29,040
Get moving, Anastasio,
hurry and make her famous.

47
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:33,499
After readinG hundreds
of magazines, l'm certain.

48
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:37,540
There is only one way to put a
princess on the front paGe today:

49
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,749
the so-called
"Beauty and the Beast" strateGy.

50
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:46,332
The princess has to fall
in love with a poor, iGnorant,

51
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,040
coarse and vulGar man.

52
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,332
His Majesty opposes it
and kicks the lout out.

53
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,499
The princess replies
that love is more than lineage,

54
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,957
there's a clash at court, Gossip
in Europe and around the world.

55
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,874
Result: months of cover stories

56
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,457
on the marriage between
the princess and the pauper.

57
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:04,749
What?

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,999
MarriaGe with the pauper?
Are you sure?

59
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,499
Yes, my dear, before the ceremony
we send the Groom a call girl,

60
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,957
we photoGraph them,

61
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,999
princess betrayed, marriaGe
canceled, more cover stories.

62
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,915
Now Your HiGhness is famous and
every charity action makes news.

63
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,207
What do you say?

64
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,540
- Call girls?
- Yeah...

65
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,540
l'll do it, just one problem...

66
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,832
Where do l find a pauper?

67
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:37,540
They're around, they're around.

68
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,874
l've already interviewed him.

69
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,582
l did some research.

70
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:43,415
LiGhts, please!

71
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,957
The most ramshackle country
in the Union,

72
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,374
its most romantic
but difficult city,

73
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,790
the poorest neighborhood,
its most wretched inhabitant,

74
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:55,290
and here is our gem:
Antonio De Biase.

75
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,957
Hey, my name's Antonio,

76
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,999
l was fired three years ago.

77
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,499
l went to my Girlfriend and said:

78
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,707
"Lovey, my darlin',
my life, my heart, l lost my job."

79
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,915
And she said:
"And your girlfriend too,

80
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,540
if money can't buy happiness,
imaGine poverty!"

81
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,582
Son-of-a gun, Ciro!

82
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,499
When l need money,
l'm a Guinea pig.

83
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:21,415
You know when it says
"clinically tested"?

84
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:23,165
That's me, the tested!

85
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:26,749
l eat medicine and then
tell about the side effects.

86
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,374
Bro, yo, yo...

87
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,790
l got side effects riGht now.

88
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,165
l say they should split
by cateGory,

89
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,332
l mean, experiment man-man,
mouse-mouse.

90
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,540
lnstead they even Get mice,
that's wrong,

91
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,749
because if the mice Get sick,
who do they Get, a kanGaroo?

92
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,582
And if they experiment
on kangaroos,

93
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,374
who do they Get, a walrus?

94
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:52,332
And if they experiment on
walruses, do they Get a draGonfly?

95
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,165
Bro, yo, yo...

96
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,707
Big bro, how's it Goin'?

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,624
l should go down there?

98
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,749
No, we'll brinG him here,

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,624
we hospitalize him
and test a new medicine.

100
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,957
Someone like that,

101
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,999
when he's not a guinea pig,
how does he get by?

102
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,624
Your most Serene HiGhness,
how does he get by? MoochinG!

103
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,790
TODAY'S OPENlNGS:
PlZZA, lCE CREAM, WlNE

104
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,957
METER MAID

105
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,874
Hello, ma'am, remember me?

106
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,540
l'm the espresso
machine technician,

107
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,374
l came to check
why it wasn't working.

108
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,790
lf you like,
l'll taste the espresso for free,

109
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:51,040
just to be nice,
to see if it still works.

110
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,540
You've never liked the theater.

111
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,707
And you've never come
to the country with me...

112
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:58,624
Great, my compliments, thank you!

113
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,207
Stop!

114
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,999
Wait, a lady's crossinG!

115
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:09,749
Without a "crosser-walk"
it's a tragedy!

116
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,790
Cool it, bro!

117
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,415
Thank you, Antonio,
for helpinG me across the street

118
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,540
every morning,
l'm such a bother.

119
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,207
No, l do it for "humanism"...

120
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:27,082
Oh, there's my bus,
l'll get a lift.

121
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,749
- Who are you?
- A relative.

122
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,540
Jeez, just look at uncle!

123
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,665
You make me so mad, Uncle.

124
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:39,332
Two things were your ruin:
women and wine.

125
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,915
He's always drinkinG,
he's Gotta lay off.

126
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:45,165
You Gotta lay off, Uncle,
l say it from the heart.

127
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,207
l don't Give a damn
about his properties,

128
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,999
l want him to be well.

129
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:55,165
The road's closed here,
Go straiGht on.

130
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,832
- Who is this guy?
- Oh, come on, Uncle.

131
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:01,540
Not the first, the second.

132
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,999
Okay, perfect, thanks.

133
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,999
Hey, what about your uncle?

134
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,249
lf he's Gotta die,
he's Gotta die.

135
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,374
Jessica!

136
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,749
Let's turn this off,

137
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,582
it's a bomb to the brain,
calm down.

138
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,957
No one understands me.

139
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,332
No one understands me!

140
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,624
- Cousin, snap out of it!
- How?

141
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:48,499
There were two thinGs in my life:
Manuel and tap dancinG.

142
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:53,249
Then the miracle: Gloria Cecchi
put Manuel and me in the musical.

143
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:56,707
The last dancers,
a minute and ten seconds on stage,

144
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:00,707
l'm at the heiGht of success,
l sell fruit tap-dancinG...

145
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,290
and what happens?

146
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:05,082
You catch Manuel in bed
with Gloria

147
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,874
and Get kicked out of the show.

148
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,999
And you say snap out of it,
but how?

149
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,082
- No red Grapes?
- Wrong season.

150
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,207
- Concord grapes?
- Next week.

151
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,332
You're so sharp,

152
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,374
as a kid you knew
everythinG about fruit:

153
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:30,624
anjou pears, fuji apples...
You invented home-delivered fruit.

154
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,332
Go back to your old life.

155
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:35,624
- What were you doing now?
- RehearsinG with Manuel.

156
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,707
- Then?
- MakinG love with Manuel.

157
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,165
Other stuff?

158
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,624
l washed and ironed
Manuel's shirts.

159
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,207
l can help you there!

160
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:49,165
Take my T-shirts and shirts.

161
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:52,332
lron the shirt collars high,

162
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:55,374
that's how Manuel wore them.

163
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:02,207
You can't go on like this,
you're a broken record!

164
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,749
Can't live by moochinG anymore.

165
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:11,207
You complain? You hire out
as a guinea pig, you're lucky.

166
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,582
Lucky? They call you
twice a year.

167
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,790
At least,
you've got a business mentality.

168
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,332
But loose ciGarettes are touGh,
the problem's the assortment.

169
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,207
We're scarce on lights
and menthols are nowhere around.

170
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,374
And where do you mooch cigars?

171
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:32,582
A clinic called me,
we'll see what happens,

172
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,415
the situation's serious,
bro, yo...

174
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,332
Our tests in this clinic

175
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:51,540
can sometimes cause
slight side effects,

176
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,207
like distortion of vision
or memory loss.

177
00:13:55,375 --> 00:14:00,249
ln mice, this medicine caused
articulation narcolepsy.

178
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:05,749
- Relax. - lt only means
your arms and legs Get numb,

179
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,665
to revive them just do this...

180
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:16,582
But I'm sure this won't happen
in human beings. Pill time!

181
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,540
Let's do this,

182
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,040
say l want to meet him
and brinG him here.

183
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:44,207
Princess, he's not
the masseur or the pedicurist,

184
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,582
you have to simulate
the spark of love,

185
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,332
isn't it best
to run into him by chance?

186
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,582
The princess!

187
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:06,415
Ain't Got eyes, bro?

188
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,207
Plan B: random clash.

189
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,707
Jessica, l found a scarf,

190
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:40,457
it's awesome!

191
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,207
And you say I never give you
presents, you'll flip.

192
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,040
Highness!

193
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,957
Plan C,

194
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:03,790
infallible!

195
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,999
Grab the doG!

196
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:10,082
Nero XVI, behave!

197
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,165
Doghouse 7, no supper!

198
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,832
l'm sorry, l'm mortified,

199
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,707
distressed,

200
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,415
appalled.

201
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,374
- ls that your dog?
- Yes.

202
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:30,332
l didn't want to attack him,
l miGht have hurt him.

203
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,207
Sir, may l offer you ice cream,
as an apoloGy?

204
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,749
You don't have to be so formal.

205
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:39,790
l have stomach cramps,
l need to walk.

206
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,957
Test subject...

207
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:49,332
- Wonderful, you do it
for humanity? - No, for 700 euro.

208
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,040
You're a sincere man.

209
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,540
A sincere man is a rarity.

210
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,749
- What's yourjob?
- l'm a noble.

211
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,582
What's your work schedule?

212
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:06,749
When a person is a noble,
she's that forever.

213
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,790
Non-stop?

214
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,832
No breaks?
You catch a bite as you work!

215
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:16,874
l'll explain,
what you see here is a kingdom

216
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,415
and l'm the princess,
the king's dauGhter,

217
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,457
and that's my castle.

218
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,957
You own a castle?

219
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,749
You must be filthy rich!

220
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:37,374
You own a castle,
you're a beautiful Girl...

221
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:40,290
So, why are you talkin' to me?

222
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,540
Why am l talkinG to you?

223
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,790
lt's obvious, because you're...

224
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,374
so deep

225
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:54,540
and acute.

226
00:17:57,541 --> 00:17:59,374
And intelliGent.

227
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,999
You know me to a T!

228
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,040
When you're pro-positive,
in moments of "optimilazation",

229
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:12,457
you hope you'll hook a Girl...

230
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:16,332
But not at your level,
so noble, superior to nobles.

231
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,957
You're actually "extra noble".

232
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:23,374
l was thinking a more basic type,
maybe more bubbly.

233
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,749
No...

234
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:31,374
actually it seems my type is...

235
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,665
someone like you.

236
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,915
You're sure, or are you kiddin'?

237
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,165
ls this "Candid Camera"?

238
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,707
You're a guinea pig, own up.

239
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,749
Look.

240
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,332
- What is it?
- My passport.

241
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:01,332
This never happens,
even your picture's beautiful.

242
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,207
A compliment...

243
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,374
"Profession:

244
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,249
princess."

245
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,707
Mer... merci, mon tresor.

246
00:19:13,916 --> 00:19:15,624

247
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,999
lt had expired, you did me
a favor, thank you.

248
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:26,374
lf you like,
l'll throw your purse, shoes...

249
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,415
You're irresistible.

250
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,957
l have to Go,
but l will run into you again.

251
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,457
l hope not "run over"!
Just a quip...

252
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,332
Right.

253
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:45,374
Bye.

254
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,999
Even for coffee, no problem!

255
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,374
lf l can Get it, l will!

256
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,374
Ok, good-bye.

257
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,207

258
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,332
l am Jesus!

259
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,749
De Biase, you're next.

260
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,957
Call me Antonio,
it's like home here.

261
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,207
l am Jesus.

262
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,374
l took bread and multiplied it,

263
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,790
l took a fish and multiplied it.

264
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,249
- You're Good at multiplying?
- Yes.

265
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:40,207
Here's 20 euro,
squeeze another one out.

266
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,999
lt's your turn.
He is with you?

267
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,624
And with your Spirit.

268
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,499
lt must be fake.

269
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,915
- Please sit down. - Doctor,
l have to ask you something:

270
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:56,832
that medicine you Gave me,
it Gives hallucinations?

271
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:59,457
No, none of the mice had any.

272
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:04,832
Then I really was
with Princess Letizia.

273
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,332
The kinG's daughter?

274
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:11,957
She says l'm her type,

275
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:16,707
that l'm acute, deep...

276
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,832
and really intelliGent!

277
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,749
Suspend testing,
the medicine's lethal,

278
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,790

279
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,499
l knew it! Hey, easy man!

280
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,957
l'm the court chamberlain. The
princess invites you to dinner.

281
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,790
Go away, you're a hallucination!

282
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,207
No, l must insist,
l'm the chamberlain.

283
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,332
First the princess,
then champagne,

284
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,999
- now l'll see the Madonna!
- The Madonna?

285
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,540
No, l'm the champaGne...
the chamberlain!

286
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:58,832
- Please, get in.
- lt's all fake,

287
00:21:59,041 --> 00:22:01,040
this doesn't exist,
you don't exist.

288
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,249
What are you doinG? Please,
Get in.

289
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,457
Please...

290
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,999
This medicine's a bombshell,
it'll go like hotcakes!

291
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:20,249
Where are you Going?
Stay still. Let's Go!

292
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,999
Good eveninG, Countess.

293
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,790
They put a tube up my nose

294
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:37,624
that went all the way
to my stomach.

295
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,332
Then they pumped me
with water and salt.

296
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:45,249
l felt my food come up
and out my ears.

297
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,874
Can I be truthful?

298
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:50,999
lt was my own orGanic stuff
and it made me sick.

299
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:54,165
Why aren't you eating?

300
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,207
Your story is so intriGuing...

301
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:01,415
Princess, would you like
a little Beethoven?

302
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,999
Very little,
or we'll Get too full.

303
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,499
But, for starters,

304
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:14,082
brinG some nice pizza bread
with prosciutto

305
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:19,457
and lots of fried things:
rice balls, doughnuts

306
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:22,040
and some olives from Tuscany.

307
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,540
From Ascoli.

308
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:27,124
You eat those yourself,
l want the Tuscany ones.

309
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,332
Do you eat fried food?

310
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:32,790
When you see it, you'll eat it.

311
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:37,749
Well, we'll serve
the escargot first, alriGht?

312
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:43,999
lf they got here before us,
serve them first,

313
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:47,832
but don't keep us waiting
or we won't eat at all, riGht?

314
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:51,624
Anyway, we have a reservation,
it says "princess",

315
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,915
in the book of the Reserves.

316
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,332
Fine.

317
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,040
- Princess...
- Princess.

318
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,665
- Hey, buddy!
- Yes?

319
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:09,290
With the fried food, l'd like
a little ketchup, mayonnaise

320
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:12,415
and some barbeque sauce.

321
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,457
Hey, bro, you're doing fine!

322
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,707
- Bro, yo, yo...
- Yo?

323
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:18,915
Bro!

324
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:23,874
- Princess.
- Princess.

325
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,915
- And who are you?
- The sommelier.

326
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,290
- You know this guy?
- Yes.

327
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,082
- So, who is he?
- The sommelier.

328
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:36,582
- And what's he do?
- l taste your wine.

329
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:39,790
We pay for it and you drink it?
ls this a joke?

330
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:45,415
And look at the price:
1950 euro.

331
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:48,207
lt's not the price, it's the date.

332
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:50,040
And it's even expired!

333
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,999
lf you don't scram,
l'll tell your pa there.

334
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:55,707
l don't like how you work,
1 to 0 for you.

335
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:58,332
Go.

336
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,457
Chew out that kid,
his work's no good.

337
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:05,999
Princess...

338
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:08,207
l'm invisible to this guy.

339
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,624
Princess, really...

340
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:16,999
l'm sorry if l was like a hick...

341
00:25:17,833 --> 00:25:19,249
No...

342
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:21,207
don't worry.

343
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:25,207
l really like your spontaneity.

344
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,832
l'd spend another...

345
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:31,457
thousand eveninGs like this.

346
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:35,540
l'm the life of the party,
l make quips, tell jokes,

347
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,415
when a guy's in the dumps,
l make him lauGh.

348
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:41,790
l don't like people to be down,
l like them up.

349
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,582
You have a charm...

350
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,249
Say it, in your own way,

351
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,082
no problem,
l'm ready for anythinG.

352
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:53,915
lt's mysterious.

353
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,249
- l Got the chills.
- lt envelops you.

354
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,332
Princess, maybe...

355
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:13,165
your hand slipped and found mine.

356
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:15,999
- Did you realize?
- Yes.

357
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,290
You did it on purpose.

358
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:19,915
Can I give you a kiss?

359
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,040
What, temporarily?

360
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:27,082
Right in front of these ruins?

361
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,249
Sure!

362
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,499
Come get the flesh!

363
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:44,290
Princess, l'll hurt you bad!

364
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:50,540
l'll make you see motorized
kanGaroos, the ones that Go...

365
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:53,332
The ones that Go...

366
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:56,415
A motorized kanGaroo.

367
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:02,582
Shall we order dessert?

368
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:04,957
Hey, princess,

369
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,665
l'll stop your cardiac zone.

370
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,832
Want dessert? l'll get it,

371
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,082
so it'll be done.

372
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:19,207
Hey princess,
remember the kanGaroos.

373
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:24,790
Mom, eat somethinG.

374
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,457
What's wrong?

375
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,999
Here l am!

376
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,124
What did you bring me?

377
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:49,415
lt must be a homemade pie!

378
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:51,707
Ma'am, l'll unblock you.

379
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:56,290
Push hard on the accelerator.

380
00:27:57,583 --> 00:28:00,457
Ma'am, floor it!

381
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:02,624
Accelerate!

382
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:17,207
Fire!

383
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,999
He's a scourge of God,

384
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:34,207
his first date, he burned down
the kingdom's most antique chalet.

385
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:37,832
l don't even want him
as a fake boyfriend!

386
00:28:39,291 --> 00:28:42,290
But it works, tickets
for the concert for Sudan

387
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:45,124
are goinG like wildfire.
Just think of all the charity

388
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:46,915
l can do after four months
like this.

389
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:49,999
No, after four months
with that beast,

390
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,040
we'll need charity ourselves.

391
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,665
Kick him out of the kingdom!

392
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:57,290
See? You don't care
about my dreams,

393
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,040
you're only interested in...
your "parties".

394
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,499
How dare you!

395
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,249
But I do.

396
00:29:07,583 --> 00:29:10,665
lt's my fault, l underestimated
that boy's devastation.

397
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,749
He should make Letizia famous
without too much damage.

398
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,499
l'll take care of it

399
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:21,040
and l'll transform
the beast in, let's say...

400
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,874
a squatter prince.

401
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,249
Okay, on one condition.

402
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:35,999
That you start seeinG Gherets.

403
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:39,499
l don't say you have
to fall in love,

404
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:42,082
just spend a little time together,

405
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:46,582
talk, get to know each other
better and then if it happens...

406
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,665
Wow, Antonio, a princess!

407
00:29:59,875 --> 00:30:02,874
Remember me
when they make you a prince!

408
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:06,749
Just one thinG: make me
the Marquise of Spaccanapoli,

409
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:09,374
so Manuel will see what he lost.

410
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:14,040
Think they'll make me a prince?
You know what l did to Letizia?

411
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,874
l am Jesus.

412
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:19,832
- Gotta go, Jesus is coming.
- Jesus?

413
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:23,665
You can't believe
the VlPs he's with!

414
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:27,332
Come here.

415
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:31,124
Come here, chéri.

416
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:37,499
The Princess invites you
to move to court.

417
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:39,582
- No fakin'?
- What?

418
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:44,165
- l should come with you?
- Give me your baGs.

419
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:53,499
Do you have
a change of underwear, sir?

420
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:57,249
To the palace!

421
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,957
You'll be in the guest
house for now.

422
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:12,082
You mean here?

423
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,249
Before you can enter the castle
you need to learn bon-ton.

424
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:19,290
- Button?
- Proper manners.

425
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:22,624
His Majesty wants his daughter's
boyfriend to respect etiquette.

426
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,582
- What?
- Etiquette.

427
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,165
- Before that.
- Respect.

428
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:29,374
- You said "boyfriend".
- Yes, you're Letizia's boyfriend.

429
00:31:29,583 --> 00:31:32,874
- But you need etiquette.
- What's that, dude?

430
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:36,082
A group of rules, for example,
you can't say "dude",

431
00:31:36,291 --> 00:31:37,540
we'll substitute it with "ooh-la".

432
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:40,832
l don't understand,
what's "ooh-la".

433
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:44,749
l don't understand you either,
so I've hired a translator.

434
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:47,582
- Professor Ruotolo!
- Here.

435
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:50,624
- What's "dude" mean?
- lt means boy.

436
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:55,249
Good dude means Good boy and
cuttin' out dude, let's go boys.

437
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,957
- Fine.
- Thank you.

438
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:01,540
- What's "ooh-la". - "Ooh-la"
is an expression of surprise

439
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:03,707
that can translate to "Oh, my".

440
00:32:03,916 --> 00:32:06,915
lf the surprise is greater,
"Oh, my goodness",

441
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,457
if the surprise is excessive:
"Oh, my God Almighty"!

442
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,040
- Fine.
- Thank you.

443
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:14,707
l'd like to start with his look,
it's a tad vintaGe.

444
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:17,624
What did he say?

445
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:20,499
Learn to dress, you're a siGht!

446
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:22,624
Look who's talkin'!

447
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:24,499
- Fine.
- Thank you.

448
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:25,749
This way.

449
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:31,957
The classic suit,
when is it worn?

450
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:35,499
- To Get a bank loan.
- No, a suit for tea.

451
00:32:35,666 --> 00:32:37,082
For me?

452
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:39,915
No, for a tea break.

453
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,582
Break dance, like this?

454
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:46,832
- Like it?
- Horrible.

455
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,582
Easy, that's for a funeral.

456
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:52,790
- No, cocktail.
- Cuddle?

457
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,915
Cocktail,
when you meet for a drink.

458
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:57,374
And this?

459
00:32:57,583 --> 00:32:59,790
- lt's a smokinG jacket.
- No, tuxedo.

460
00:33:00,041 --> 00:33:02,040
- And this?
- Tuxedo.

461
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,499
- No, you missed two out of two!
- l'm consistent.

462
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:08,124
You're a stinker!
You make me talk like you.

463
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:11,332
Can I ask a question, bro?

464
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:14,665
Every time a guy has a drink
he's Gotta change suits?

465
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:19,457
To get a drink at night,
l go in pajamas or penguin suit?

466
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,665
Ruotolo!

467
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,290
He asked: "When l am
in the arms of Morpheus

468
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:27,457
and feel the need
to placate my thirst,

469
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:31,124
may I quench my thirst in pajamas
or must l wear a tuxedo?"

470
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:35,332
How often we've heard
the importance of being oneself...

471
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:37,582
Not in your case.

472
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,165
l just Got one wrong...

473
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,665
- Let's Go!
- What a weirdo!

474
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,832
This has to Go.

475
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:48,290
lt's not hair, it's a haystack!

476
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:52,665
- l can see Letizia "zumtimes"?
- Not talkinG like that.

477
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:55,082
l still have this tiny defect.

478
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:57,915
Sometimes with an S
like the Salvation Army.

479
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:03,624
- You're a Good "babber".
- Barber with an R like Rotary.

480
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,499
- Say "barber".
- Babber please.

481
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:08,457
Without please!

482
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:12,499
Your school burned down
after first grade.

483
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:15,290
- l want to die!
- And l'll come to your funeral.

484
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:18,582
Have you learned etiquette?

485
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,624
l'm great, l'm gettin' better.

486
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:23,290
Hurry, l can't wait
to have you at court.

487
00:34:23,541 --> 00:34:25,790
l'm leavinG, l have
an exhibition for Ethiopia,

488
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,915
you know, world hunger...

489
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:31,290
Food's Good but not drink,
they'd be in a tough spot,

490
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:36,790
not knowinG how to dress,
they have to undress, dress...

491
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,999
l'm learninG.

492
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:41,457
Alright, I'm GoinG.

493
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,874
You're hurtin' me!

494
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,749
Every time l kiss the princess,
a photo comes out.

495
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:57,624
You still have
these frivolous curls?

496
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:59,249
Cup.

497
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,874
Cup!

498
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:04,457
Tea is taken
sittinG erect, leGs together,

499
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:06,624
arms tight down and chin raised.

500
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:10,665
Only after a car crash
l'd be in this position!

501
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,165
Arms tiGht down!

502
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:14,790
Pain therapy might be useful
in your case.

503
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:23,707
True friends come in bad times,
but especially in good times.

504
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:25,124
Who are they?

505
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:29,790
l found them in the Garden,
they're Master Antonio's friends.

506
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,457
Whatjoy!

507
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:37,082
l swear on my dead
cousin's body, l missed you.

508
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:41,290
On my dead cousin's body and my
father's, l missed you even more.

509
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:44,707
On my dad's and mom's bodies,
l missed you too much.

510
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:48,207
- This is a family massacre!
- Speaking of family,

511
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:50,832
let me introduce
my cousin Jessica Quagliarulo,

512
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:52,874
l mooched off her like crazy.

513
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:56,874
No, the last time
they swiped my bracelet,

514
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:59,082
l'll say hello my way.

515
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:02,499
l got your shirt dirty,
l'm sorry.

516
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:06,582
- What are you doing?
- Spit gets the stain right off.

517
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:08,207
Just a second more.

518
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,624
- Am l hurting you?
- Your heel!

519
00:36:11,708 --> 00:36:13,915
l'm sorry, Mr. Champagne.

520
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:16,040
Just a lot of talk...

521
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,957
And no drink,
where's this champagne?

522
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:21,874
Will you be staying long?

523
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:23,790
Dudes...

524
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,499
- Roses here! Hi, ChampaGne.
- Hello.

525
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:35,540
We're outta shampoo.

526
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:37,124
There's mail!

527
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:40,332
What's the property tax
on a castle?

528
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:41,957
And Gas and electricity bills?

529
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,374
Preparin' an estimate?
They're really organized here.

530
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:49,624
- Coffee?
- No, thank you. Let's Go study.

531
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,332
- And you?
- l'll dress and come.

532
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:55,374
Cover up and don't come.
Antonio, let's go!

533
00:36:55,583 --> 00:36:56,874
Can I make more coffee?

534
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:58,957
- Miss QuaGliarulo...
- Yes.

535
00:37:00,458 --> 00:37:03,249
- Hello.
- Goodbye, Champagne.

536
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:11,749
My dear Antonio, you're makinG
your debut at court tonight,

537
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,540
there's a charity concert.

538
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,374
- Will Letizia be there?
- Of course!

539
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:19,999
Okay then!

540
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:23,832
But you must learn to Greet
in a natural manner.

541
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,832
- Look, they're beautiful!
- They're scary, who are they?

542
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,874
What?

543
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,540
The Ambassador, His Excellency,

544
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:35,624
the Marquise of DraGo,
Serene HiGhness, and the Countess.

545
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:37,249
Say it!

546
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:42,040
- And that's, what's he called...
- Never talk like that.

547
00:37:42,666 --> 00:37:44,374
Say it.

548
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:48,874
All these old fogies!

549
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:51,540
What? This is the creme
of the aristocracy.

550
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:53,582
lt's not the creme...

551
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:55,624
it's the cremation!

552
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:59,915
Now Greet them elegantly
but discretely

553
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:02,624
and especially, naturally.

554
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:04,790
Don't worry.

555
00:38:08,833 --> 00:38:11,040
Hiya, bro, great!

556
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,082
Disgusting.

557
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,207
Gimme five!

558
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,915
Count Borromeo is asleep.

559
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,165
And you wake me up to tell me?

560
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:03,040
Get some shut-eye,
it's so comfy here.

561
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:22,957
Can't you hear?

562
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:24,665
Sorry!

563
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:27,957
When you're done,
we're waitin' outside.

564
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:31,249
- Just you?
- No, all of us. - Jessi too?

565
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,999
- Okay, see ya later.
- Take it easy!

566
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,165
That's enough!

567
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,582
You are a hick.

568
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:44,040
Okay, maestro,
if it's time to talk, let's.

569
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:47,207
You've busted our nuts
to smithereens!

570
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:49,999
This is true art,
it's pure chamber music.

571
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:53,915
Yeah, bed chamber,
we're all snoozin'.

572
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,040
This guy knows what l mean.

573
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:59,874
Do somethinG more modern,
like Peppino di Capri,

574
00:40:00,041 --> 00:40:02,249
do you know "Champagne"?

575
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,374
You don't even know "Champagne"

576
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:08,207
and you call yourself a maestro!

577
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:11,665
You're not a maestro,
you're just a horn-tooter!

578
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:14,249
When you Gotta, you gotta.

579
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,082
Sorry they woke you up,

580
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,957
maybe your dead Grannie
had winninG Lotto numbers for you.

581
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:26,207
You are a boorish man,
l say this music is very youthful.

582
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,665
Countess,

583
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:31,749
you say "youthful", but on your lD

584
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:35,124
your birth date says
"Battle of Waterloo"!

585
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,582
lt's written in Roman numerals.

586
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:40,874
Where did you brinG me,
to the morgue?

587
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,082
l'm sorry, Count.

588
00:40:45,291 --> 00:40:47,374
That boy is right,

589
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:50,040
someone finally said it.

590
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:08,707
You are always elusive,
Countess D'ArmaGnac.

591
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:10,290
Smack!

592
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:15,457
How do you find this jacket?

593
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:18,665
- l'd find it everywhere.
- Son-of-a-Gun!

594
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:22,249
The buffet!

595
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,915
Let's not make a show
of ourselves!

596
00:41:25,875 --> 00:41:29,707
l'm losinG a button,
darn the court seamstresses!

597
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:32,540
Relax, Mr. Champagne,
l'll fix it.

598
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:36,499
- What are you doing?
- GettinG some thread.

599
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:42,040
ln a Gala evening
somethinG like this happens...

600
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,707
Done.

601
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:48,249
Miss Quagliarulo,
this is a miracle!

602
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,499
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

603
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:59,457
Letizia, my love, l was looking
for you and your father.

604
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:03,040
My father is with
the Countess D'Armagnac.

605
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,915
l can't bear her,
she's always on the make.

606
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:09,082
l've just been supplied
with 500 i-Mirrors,

607
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:13,624
so I thought l'd donate 499
to your needy peoples

608
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:15,207
and, big surprise,

609
00:42:15,458 --> 00:42:18,874
l'll hide the last one in the
castle so you can hunt for it.

610
00:42:20,333 --> 00:42:21,790
l'm off.

611
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:28,665
Fame works, the concert has raised
15,000 euro for charity,

612
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:31,040
instead of the usual 250.

613
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:33,207
Are you listeninG?

614
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:36,665
l'm worried, he's too chatty.

615
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:40,457
lt's okay if an African
Gets my job,

616
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:43,374
he's hard up
and it's an act of humanity,

617
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:48,290
but when mice steal yourjob,
that's an act of "mousanity".

618
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:50,957
lt's a question of logic.
What's yourjob?

619
00:42:51,916 --> 00:42:55,624
- l manaGe my accounts.
- You manaGe a count?

620
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:57,040
That's enough!

621
00:42:57,208 --> 00:43:00,457
You're an offence to savoir faire.

622
00:43:01,166 --> 00:43:03,499
l don't know any Mr. Faire.

623
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:07,457
Princess, be ready for anythinG.

624
00:43:07,666 --> 00:43:10,499
l say hello to anyone
l know, it's my way.

625
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:12,290
Savoir faire

626
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,499
is an order of Good manners.

627
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:18,707
You mustn't yell

628
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:21,874
and you mustn't eat
with your hands.

629
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:27,040
So, I can't put my finGer
in the whipped cream,

630
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:29,874
but people can spit at me?

631
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:31,707
That's enough, you hick!

632
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:34,290
You've offended my Guests,
Get out!

633
00:43:34,541 --> 00:43:39,665
- Majesty...
- Get out!

634
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:41,124
Majesty...

635
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:45,082
Take it easy, bro,
we'll work this out between us.

636
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:48,790
Dad, you can't throw him out.

637
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:55,915
l... l love him.

638
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:05,457
l don't want
this troglodyte at court!

639
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:08,124
lf you throw him out, l'll follow
him and renounce the crown.

640
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,332
What? Your mother's crown.

641
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:16,540
Love counts much more
for me than the crown.

642
00:44:16,708 --> 00:44:19,540
- Antonio stays here.
- Then keep him in the garden!

643
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:23,207
Chamberlain, he must never again
set foot in this castle!

644
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:26,040
Can I say something?

645
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:30,499
We haven't known each other lonG,
a friendship hasn't bloomed yet,

646
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:33,915
a collaboration might come about,
knowinG one another.

647
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:37,082
l'll never collaborate with you,

648
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:39,040
you disGust me!

649
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:43,040
- Sire, it's all feigned.
- No, he disGusts me really!

650
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:46,040
This man will Give me a stroke.

651
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,124
l'll die of a stroke!

652
00:45:00,666 --> 00:45:02,874
lt's just Great here.

653
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:05,249
Who's movin'!

654
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,915
Don't talk with your mouth full.

655
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:10,124
Wait, when l finish...

656
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,915
What's the matter?

657
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:36,665
l was having a sandwich,
l saw you and...

658
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:39,040
wanted to say hello and thank you

659
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:43,249
for saying you love me
in front of your father.

660
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:45,874
You could have said itjust to me,

661
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:50,040
but l understand
you're committed to your father...

662
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:54,207
First your father, then your
horse, l never Get to talk to you,

663
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:57,040
anyway, l wanted to say
that after all...

664
00:45:58,458 --> 00:46:01,540
since you're a woman
and l'm a man,

665
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:06,499
there's love,
it's stranGe there's no brood yet.

666
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:11,249
We could Go ridinG.

667
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:14,040
Do you know how to mount a horse?

668
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,915
You'd better give it to me
already mounted.

669
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:19,040
Can you ride horseback?

670
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:26,624
Princess,
maybe you "undervaluate".

671
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,707
Please.

672
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,915
Good boy!

673
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,249
You're good with horses!

674
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:42,457
Maybe...

675
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,665
it was mounted wronG.

676
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:48,665
- We lost the horse.
- But we found cherries.

677
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:51,499
We lost a horse
and you think about cherries.

678
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:54,290
They remind me
of when I started mooching,

679
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:59,874
it's always moving to remember
the past, never forGet that.

680
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:03,499
- Why are you barefoot?
- No, why are your boots still on?

681
00:47:03,708 --> 00:47:06,290
lt's so nice
to Go barefoot on the grass.

682
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:10,499
lf l said Go topless, you might
think l was makinG a pass...

683
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:12,624
Take them off, go on!

684
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:16,207
Now l'll come down,
let's be toGether a little.

685
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,332
You miss me, l know you.

686
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:20,374
Little cherry!

687
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:27,207
l haven't done this
since my mother was alive.

688
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:31,040
She planted these cherry trees.

689
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,249
The people really loved her,

690
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:36,207
but she never told me her secret.

691
00:47:36,875 --> 00:47:39,499
Maybe it was she went barefoot.

692
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,249
Anyway, if l owned a tree,

693
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,082
l'd make lots ofjellies,

694
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:52,207
because if you squeeze
the "juiz" from the cherries,

695
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:57,040
you getjelly
and you can make jelly buns,

696
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:02,249
it's a good idea.
You could even open a shop.

697
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:07,082
There's no bar around here
that can sell jelly buns,

698
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:08,957
it's a brilliant idea.

699
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:14,374
Put a sign on the castle:
"Jelly Buns".

700
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,832
Princess, your horse.

701
00:48:23,666 --> 00:48:25,874
That's jelly!

702
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:49,082
This is a fairytale!

703
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:51,957
She'll give up
the crown for you, look.

704
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:57,874
Jessica, stretch out here,
we have to talk to Antonio.

705
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:04,082
- The princess is pretty, huh?
- What's she like?

706
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:06,374
The princess is a princess.

707
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:08,874
At first they're all princesses,

708
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:11,707
then when they do certain thinGs,
they're a wow!

709
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:13,915
- Where did you meet her?
- On Facebook?

710
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:17,957
- Did she make a friend request?
- They've friends in common?

711
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:21,332
- You know who tagGed her?
- Peppe the stable boy.

712
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:28,499
Guys, the princess
is something bourgeoisie.

713
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:32,749
- Don't talk difficult.
- She's a different social status,

714
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:35,957
because she goes from beinG
a princess, to beinG a queen.

715
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:38,665
- Automatically.
- No contest.

716
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,874
Like in a factory when
a dad leaves his job to his son.

717
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:46,457
Damned lucky!

718
00:49:46,666 --> 00:49:48,665
What did you do?

719
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:51,040
- Where did you take her?
- Your room?

720
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:54,707
- A hotel?
- A car with newspapers?

721
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,999
We spent time in the garden...

722
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:01,832
With newspapers around the tree?

723
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:04,249
Maybe you don't get it,

724
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,707
one little kiss

725
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:08,915
and we're in all the papers,

726
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:12,165
if we did more,
we'd end up in DVDs!

727
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:15,457
Are you in love?

728
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:21,082
Besides that,
l think...

729
00:50:23,208 --> 00:50:25,749
you can love without makinG love.

730
00:50:25,958 --> 00:50:28,249
- He did nothin'.
- You're a jackass!

731
00:50:29,666 --> 00:50:33,749
Take us to the castle
for our ciGarette assortment.

732
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:37,457
But, don't pull your usual stuff.

733
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:41,207
- Promise?
- Promise.

734
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:43,040
Let's get some sun first.

735
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:49,707
lt's my first time in here.

736
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:53,540
- Are there any ciGars? - I don't
know, it's my first time.

737
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:55,957
What's this thing?

738
00:50:57,041 --> 00:50:59,499
Look in the mirror
one at a time, please.

739
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:01,624
One at a time please.

740
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:04,665
- What is it, scales?
- Stop, don't touch anything.

741
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:06,707
No cigars here.

742
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:09,540
- You gettin' a tan?
- No, just checkin'.

743
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:13,457
Here! "CiGar, cigar..."
Boxes of ciGars.

744
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:23,499
l caught you, little owl!

745
00:51:36,041 --> 00:51:37,499
Was that the kinG?

746
00:51:37,708 --> 00:51:40,290
l dunno, who was
lookin' at the Guy?

747
00:51:42,041 --> 00:51:44,249
- Looked like him.
- Let's Go see.

748
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,915
Don't!

749
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:52,874
This is a Government meetinG!

750
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,165
And you're Governin' great!

751
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:58,832
l've had it, none of you
can come in the castle again.

752
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:00,207
Guards!

753
00:52:00,458 --> 00:52:03,040
- Run!
- Easy to say!

754
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:17,957
This castle's endless.

755
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:20,332
lt took an hour
from entry to exit.

756
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:23,582
- So, from castle to castle?
- One hour.

757
00:52:23,791 --> 00:52:25,374
What's this here?

758
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:28,499
Gherets, turn on
the air conditioner please?

759
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:32,749
- There's the guy
with the biG ears. - Gherets!

760
00:52:33,666 --> 00:52:36,665
For you, l'd turn the stars on,
one by one.

761
00:52:40,916 --> 00:52:44,165
That ridiculous Group
Going around the castle...

762
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:46,207
l found out...

763
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:50,332
His cousin wants
to be in a musical, crazy!

764
00:52:50,541 --> 00:52:52,540
Have you seen the other two?

765
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,624
The e-normous and the e-small.

766
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:06,665
By the way,
that wretch you use to Get famous,

767
00:53:06,875 --> 00:53:08,582
how much longer does he stay?

768
00:53:10,041 --> 00:53:13,040
The chamberlain says
as long as he makes news,

769
00:53:14,541 --> 00:53:16,124
so about three months.

770
00:53:18,041 --> 00:53:21,499
l know it's all fake, but...

771
00:53:22,458 --> 00:53:24,040
l'm jealous.

772
00:53:24,875 --> 00:53:27,249
Of Antonio? Come on!

773
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:30,499
We have nothinG in common,

774
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:33,249
his ignorance is stellar.

775
00:53:35,666 --> 00:53:38,040
He wanted to put
a siGn on the castle:

776
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:40,374
"Jelly Buns".

777
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:47,082
Are you sure
you won't fall in love with him?

778
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:54,082
lt's one of the few things
l'm sure of.

779
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:03,915
Your eyes are like the moon
reflectinG in the Pacific.

780
00:54:04,666 --> 00:54:07,249
Gherets, relax.

781
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:10,249
Guys,

782
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:12,707
it was obvious!

783
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:17,040
You didn't understand?

784
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:19,665
Well, did you?

785
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:27,040
Anyway I'm just fine.

786
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,499
- Stay cool.
- You're okay?

787
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:42,040
Just fine.

788
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:15,540
l can't stand
seeinG you like this.

789
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:19,582
And stop listeninG
to "lndifferently".

790
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:24,790
There's always
a second chance, right?

791
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:33,999
Answer.

792
00:55:42,125 --> 00:55:46,332
Sorry, is this 91457569?

793
00:55:47,541 --> 00:55:49,374
You didn't get one number right!

794
00:55:50,583 --> 00:55:54,207
What are we doing here?
Why don't we go?

795
00:55:55,583 --> 00:55:57,790
When you want,
you make it all work out.

796
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,999
You showed us
we can live Great without money.

797
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,415
But without love too,
that's overdoing it!

798
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,415
You have to work hard for love

799
00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:10,624
and besides, they're the wretches.

800
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:14,499
Antonio, make them respect you.

801
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,707
You did a terrible thing.

802
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:22,124
- You mooched on feelinGs.
- What?

803
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:26,332
lf you'd said you needed a
squatter prince, l'd have done it!

804
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:29,374
- Let me explain...
- What's to explain?

805
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:31,582
l'm tellin' the papers,

806
00:56:31,791 --> 00:56:35,790
that Letizia isn't a princess,
she's a witch, she exploited me.

807
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,624
You'll ruin me.

808
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:40,249
So, if you don't want me
to ruin you,

809
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:42,290
l ask just one thing:

810
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:45,374
help me make her fall in love.

811
00:56:46,416 --> 00:56:48,915
The way you are it's impossible,
l tried.

812
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:51,040
You have to work harder.

813
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:57,374
Give me a hand.

814
00:56:57,583 --> 00:56:59,790
Give me a hand...

815
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:09,207
- We usually walk like this...
- Stop!

816
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:11,999
Lift your arms.

817
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:16,165
- Have you washed your underarms?
- Yes.

818
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:17,957
Down.

819
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,999
Whatever happens,

820
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:24,624
the little ball must never drop.

821
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:29,582
Everything can be done
with your arms at your sides.

822
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:31,999
- Howdy do, bro.
- No, you can't say that!

823
00:57:32,208 --> 00:57:36,165
You can jump...
dance the twist...

824
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:38,582
l'm familiar
with singing and dancing.

825
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:40,790
Shout after a Goal...

826
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:46,207
- Damn!
- These thinGs are basic!

827
00:57:46,416 --> 00:57:49,040
They're basic, you're right.

828
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:53,957
Good, study, apply yourself.

829
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:09,374
Sometimes, sometimes...

830
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:15,207
Good, study.

831
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,207
- Sometimes.
- Good!

832
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:16,582
Do you like my attire?

833
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:20,249
- Does "attire".
- No, it's your clothes.

834
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,957
Count, hello!

835
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:25,790
Do you like Ariosto?

836
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:28,874
l love a roast with potatoes,
Mr. Marquis.

837
00:59:29,083 --> 00:59:32,290
Taste is a matter
of "up-onion".

838
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:38,290
Exceptional improvement, you have
a bent for beinG aristocratic.

839
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:42,790
BeinG aristocratic is easy,
just don't do a thing all day.

840
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,999
Wise observation!

841
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:49,415
The work of seduction can begin,
do you know Jacques Prevert?

842
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:51,832
- Who's he?
- A poet, Letizia adores him.

843
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:54,874
Are you up to memorizinG
all his poetry?

844
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:58,499
My memory's not so great,
how's your phosphorus?

845
00:59:58,708 --> 01:00:00,124
Fine...

846
01:00:00,333 --> 01:00:01,957
Antonio!

847
01:00:03,541 --> 01:00:06,540
- What is it?
- l'm not so worried now.

848
01:00:17,166 --> 01:00:18,999
l got pricked, there's blood.

849
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:21,415
Good, that means you're human.

850
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:23,040
Ready?

851
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:27,665
Youth in love kiss standinG up...

852
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,707
Youth in love kiss standinG out...

853
01:00:30,916 --> 01:00:33,332
No, standing up!

854
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:39,582
Against the doors of the niGht.

855
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,707
Antonio, is that you?

856
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:47,415
Yes, it's me.

857
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:48,832
What are you doinG?

858
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,249
NothinG, you know,
l didn't have...

859
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:54,540
much "sleepfulness",

860
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,665
so I said: l'll sing
a couple of Neapolitan songs...

861
01:00:58,416 --> 01:01:02,249
No, that was Prevert, l know.

862
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:06,124
Do you know Jacques like me?

863
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:08,207
Hot digGity!

864
01:01:09,375 --> 01:01:11,374
l just love Prevert.

865
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:14,207
- You do?
- Wow!

866
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,582
By heart, do you know

867
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:20,207
"Chanson"?

868
01:01:25,166 --> 01:01:27,374
Sure, "Chanson",

869
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:29,999
you ask if l know "Chanson"?

870
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:35,332
- l can't find it! - Hurry,
if Dad comes, he'll get mad.

871
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:38,165
Want to hear
the version that's famous

872
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:41,207
or the one on the Internet?

873
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:42,624
There's only one...

874
01:01:42,791 --> 01:01:45,207
- Found it!
- Perfect.

875
01:01:45,791 --> 01:01:47,999
- "What day is it?"
- Thursday.

876
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:50,415
- That's the poem!
- What day is it?

877
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:53,457
- Thursday.
- Now you're doinG it too!

878
01:01:53,583 --> 01:01:56,499
What day is it?
lt is everyday, my friend...

879
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,457
lt is everyday, my friend...

880
01:01:58,666 --> 01:02:02,165
- lt is an entire life, my love...
- lt's an entire life, my love...

881
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:06,374
- We love, we live...
- We love, we live...

882
01:02:06,625 --> 01:02:08,540
We... damn!

883
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:12,374
The roses are moving
but there's no wind.

884
01:02:12,583 --> 01:02:15,790
No, it's a bad, uGly cat! Quiet!

885
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:23,749
l never kick cats but
when one interrupts a poem...

886
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:25,457
ya darn tootin'!

887
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:32,457
We love, we live...

888
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:46,832
We don't know what life is,
my love,

889
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:49,124
and we don't know what days are...

890
01:02:50,875 --> 01:02:52,957
We don't know anything anymore!

891
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:01,582
A poet's suffering.

892
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:03,624
l hear footsteps.

893
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:06,374
l've had it!

894
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,832
Chamberlain!

895
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:14,915
False alarm. The poem?

896
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:23,249
- Still want Prevert?
- Jacques.

897
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:35,207
There's a poem

898
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:40,040
that's very beautiful,
it's called "Indifferently".

899
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:43,457
lt Goes like this, more or less...

900
01:03:46,166 --> 01:03:47,999
Do what you want to me,

901
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:49,999
indifferently,

902
01:03:50,416 --> 01:03:52,707
l know l'm nothing for you.

903
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:56,874
Give me this poison,
don't wait for tomorrow,

904
01:03:57,791 --> 01:04:00,790
because, indifferently,
if you kill me,

905
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,832
l won't say a thinG.

906
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:10,790
lt's beautiful.

907
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:14,415
Why don't I know it?

908
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:16,624
He wrote it after death.

909
01:04:17,583 --> 01:04:22,499
l mean, he wrote the rouGh draft,
then they copied it over.

910
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:24,624
What a story, huh?

911
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:28,249
So now l know where you sleep,
where you are.

912
01:04:29,125 --> 01:04:30,957
Maybe "zumtime"...

913
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,624
Sometime,

914
01:04:35,541 --> 01:04:39,624
l'll come to say
Good moon.

915
01:05:00,791 --> 01:05:01,915
Hi, ChampaGne!

916
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:05,665
Hello, does the lady desire tea

917
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:09,707
with light, delicate,
whole Grain cookies?

918
01:05:09,916 --> 01:05:12,124
Am l in the hospital?

919
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:15,040
Today there's a deliGhtful breeze.

920
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:18,249
- No, spaGhetti with clam sauce!
- Clam sauce?

921
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,290
l see.

922
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,999
- ChampaGne?
- Yes!

923
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:30,207
l'd really rather have
pasta and beans with mixed pasta,

924
01:05:30,416 --> 01:05:32,624
l'll make some next time.

925
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:34,832
Mixed pasta?

926
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:39,374
Pasta and beans
with mixed pasta...

927
01:05:47,583 --> 01:05:50,207
- Any news from Letizia?
- She asked about you three times.

928
01:05:50,416 --> 01:05:53,624
And she fired the librarian
for not finding "Indifferently".

929
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:55,915
- Next move?
- You have to disappear.

930
01:05:56,125 --> 01:05:58,124
One who has things
at her beck and call

931
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:02,540
can only love one who runs,
and sufferinG will do her Good.

932
01:06:03,583 --> 01:06:05,415
- And you?
- What?

933
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:09,790
Jessica!

934
01:06:10,791 --> 01:06:12,999
- l adore Miss Quagliarulo.
- l knew it!

935
01:06:13,208 --> 01:06:17,040
Some brotherly advice:
what can you do in this outfit?

936
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:19,332
- You look like a twit.
- What?

937
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:21,749
- An oaf.
- Thank you.

938
01:06:21,958 --> 01:06:23,957
l'd like to ask you:

939
01:06:24,166 --> 01:06:26,999
when's the last time
you made love?

940
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,832
ln 1984.

941
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:33,374
- You're in a bad way!
- You think?

942
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,332
- Twenty-nine very long years.
- Of cobwebs!

943
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:40,165
What did you do to me?

944
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:44,999
That's called anti-aging, now the
moustache Goes and you're perfect!

945
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,415
Why?

946
01:06:49,791 --> 01:06:50,999
Cry!

947
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:53,624
- Cry!
- But it's just a dead canary!

948
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:56,665
ln Naples,
even a canary is family.

949
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,832
lt's a relative.

950
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:03,040
He shouldn't have done it!

951
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:06,790
He looks like he's sleeping,
he was sweet as pie!

952
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,457
- Give me a hankie.
- Here.

953
01:07:10,666 --> 01:07:13,499
- Good, tear your heart out!
- The canary died!

954
01:07:15,541 --> 01:07:16,749
Keep it.

955
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:20,582
- Guys!
- Save me from this nightmare.

956
01:07:20,833 --> 01:07:23,832
Now they'll teach you
to say hello.

957
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:26,874
Come on!

958
01:07:27,083 --> 01:07:28,999
Let's repeat:

959
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:34,207
Bro, lil' bro, big bro, my bro,
my pal, my best pal!

960
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:36,832
Go!

961
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,332
Bro, lil' bro, big bro, my bro,
my pal, my best pal,

962
01:07:42,541 --> 01:07:46,832
cousin of my pal's pal...
Okay?

963
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,832
Not bad.
Did you study the insults?

lnsult number four.

965
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:57,582
You're a dimwit!

And now I'll bite my tonGue!

967
01:08:01,291 --> 01:08:03,207
- Too much?
- No, Good.

968
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,832
Just in case,
if you want an explanation,

969
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:09,249
you need a special attitude

970
01:08:09,458 --> 01:08:12,540
when you don't understand
very well, do this.

971
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:15,374
What's this stuff, bro?
What is it?

972
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:17,790
Bro, yo, yo...

973

You're the woman who has Generated
the most emotion...

- Good!
- Promoted?

983
01:08:55,625 --> 01:08:57,915
ConsiderinG that
the last time he made love,

984
01:08:58,166 --> 01:09:00,374
Tutankhamun was 18,

985
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:01,999
he's promoted.

986
01:09:18,791 --> 01:09:21,790
GOOD MOON

Champagne, is that you?

989
01:10:16,166 --> 01:10:17,790
How about some macaroni omelet?

990
01:10:18,583 --> 01:10:20,207
l shouldn't, I'm on a diet.

991
01:10:21,333 --> 01:10:23,249
Maybe a tad... it's with bacon?

992
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:27,665
No, sausaGe with "friars".

993
01:10:28,583 --> 01:10:31,790
- Whose friars?
- Friarielli.

994
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,207
Champagne, you're temptinG me.

995

- Chamberlain!
- Sire!

What's happeninG to Letizia?

998
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:45,415
She's actinG strange,
always so pensive,

999
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:47,457
tell me what's wronG with her.

1000
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:52,999
l wouldn't know, perhaps
problems with her charity?

1001
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:57,207
l have a feeling,
and l'm not often wronG,

1002
01:10:57,416 --> 01:11:01,040
she's fallinG in love
with Gherets.

1003
01:11:02,416 --> 01:11:07,082
Majesty, your instinct
is incredible, l'll check.

1004
01:11:07,291 --> 01:11:10,124
After that,
l have Minister Chun Lai

1005
01:11:10,333 --> 01:11:13,540
who must be escorted
to the service door.

1006
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:15,957
- Come immediately!
- CominG.

1007
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,957
Pardon, I have
a diplomatic mission.

1008
01:11:24,958 --> 01:11:26,790
See ya!

1009
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:38,332
Come on, you can do everything
with spread elbows!

1010
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:41,374
Days of study out the window,

1011
01:11:41,583 --> 01:11:43,999
you got her laughinG
and then you left.

1012
01:11:44,208 --> 01:11:46,415
l couldn't keep the king waitinG.

1013
01:11:46,625 --> 01:11:48,624
Okay, wait another 20 years!

1014
01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:51,249
When will you think of yourself?

1015
01:11:51,458 --> 01:11:53,874
Put your hands in your pockets,
elbows wide!

1016
01:11:57,916 --> 01:12:00,415
- Let's have some.
- l'll get the cutlery.

1017
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:03,332
Cutlery?
We'll eat it like this.

1018
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:08,540
- Life is now: now or never aGain.
- Who gives a damn!

1019
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:14,499
How are you eatinG?
That's not the way.

1020
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:18,540
When you eat watermelon,
you gotta Get drippy,

1021
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:20,582
but without gettin' stained.

1022
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:22,499
You Gotta eat at 90.

1023
01:12:22,666 --> 01:12:25,082
- What?
- At 90 deGrees.

1024
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:27,749
Bend over a little,

1025
01:12:27,958 --> 01:12:29,790
stretch your arms out.

1026
01:12:30,375 --> 01:12:32,999
You can even move
and eat like this.

1027
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:37,207
This way you Get drippy,
but not stained.

1028
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:42,374
The Greatest melon eaters
have scoliosis.

1029
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:47,207
Besides, Jessica will never
love a guy who can't eat at 90.

1030
01:12:47,416 --> 01:12:49,249
- You're sure?
- Yeah!

1031
01:12:49,458 --> 01:12:52,290
And then, some advice,

1032
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:55,874
keep your pinky finger up.

1033
01:12:56,083 --> 01:12:58,707
lf you eat a sandwich
with sausaGe and broccoli,

1034
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:00,540
keep your pinky up,

1035
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:03,957
so you can use it to pick
the broccoli from your teeth.

1036
01:13:04,166 --> 01:13:07,999
- lncredible!
- Sure, the old ways.

1037
01:13:12,541 --> 01:13:14,749
Why are you helping me?

1038
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:22,165
l like to see people happy,

1039
01:13:24,625 --> 01:13:26,540
especially if they're
in a bad way like you.

1040
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:29,957
l'm sorry for what
l thouGht about you,

1041
01:13:30,166 --> 01:13:32,249
you're better than
so many living at the castle.

1042
01:13:33,583 --> 01:13:35,582
What's all these feelings?

1043
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:38,082
You're not poor like me?

1044
01:13:44,375 --> 01:13:45,999
My father was a laborer,

1045
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:51,415
my mother's unknown, don't ask
for details, l didn't find out.

1046
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:55,540
l knew we had something
in common!

1047
01:14:00,375 --> 01:14:02,999
l'd like to help you
for what l can.

1048
01:14:03,666 --> 01:14:06,915
- Are you jealous?
- No.

1049
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:10,957
- We all need our own space.
- You'll be a cuckold!

1050
01:14:12,083 --> 01:14:14,707
Women like a little jealousy,

1051
01:14:14,916 --> 01:14:17,749
your woman has to be untouchable,
not to be looked at.

1052
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:20,165
She's has to be a haG?

1053
01:14:20,583 --> 01:14:23,999
l'll explain,
all at once is hard.

1054
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:28,332
Listen, these thing l said,

1055
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:30,249
never tell them to anyone.

1056
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:33,832
A secret.

1057
01:14:35,916 --> 01:14:37,540
Like we were friends?

1058
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:58,415
Madame...

1059
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:01,249
lnsult number 7...

1060
01:15:01,458 --> 01:15:03,874
You're more dimwitted

1061
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:09,707
than your ma and your pa
put toGether!

1062
01:15:09,916 --> 01:15:12,207
And now I'll bite my tonGue!

1063
01:15:12,833 --> 01:15:14,457
What are you saying?

1064
01:15:14,666 --> 01:15:17,665
l'm nervous, it's our first date.

1065
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:25,582
Wait.

1066
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:29,207
What are you lookinG at? Anyone
ever tell you you're an idiot?

1067
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:33,165
lf they do, call me
and we'll beat him up together.

1068
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:35,374
lce cream at 90?

1069
01:16:12,875 --> 01:16:16,957
Prevert,
with his lyric "lonGering" says...

1070
01:16:17,166 --> 01:16:19,415
Damn you, hell!

1071
01:16:19,625 --> 01:16:21,832
We say: damn you to hell!

1072
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,999
You're good!
The word is "linGering".

1073
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:30,790
Anyway, the insult goes like this:
damn you to hell.

1074
01:16:30,916 --> 01:16:33,665
lt's a little bland as an insult,

1075
01:16:33,875 --> 01:16:37,290
it's not: l'll now bite
my tongue, bro, yo, yo...

1076
01:16:38,583 --> 01:16:42,165
You can Give it more substance
and it becomes...

1077
01:16:44,875 --> 01:16:47,707
Quiet dude, or I can't say it.

1078
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:49,332
l'm listening.

1079
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:52,165
You can also say:
damn you to hell and back.

1080
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:54,415
- Never say "die"!
- Never.

1081
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:57,624
You can add the family:

1082
01:16:57,833 --> 01:16:59,874
damn you and yours
to hell and back

1083
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:03,082
to those who don't raise
their hands.

1084
01:17:07,166 --> 01:17:10,624
You don't need
a translator anymore.

1085
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:13,415
Ruotolo, you're fired!

1086
01:17:13,666 --> 01:17:15,040
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1087
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:17,290
Letizia has a crush,

1088
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:19,874
but, if l were you...

1089
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:24,707
l'd write somethinG romantic,
a finishinG touch.

1090
01:17:25,666 --> 01:17:29,874
Your own words,
you don't need all these books.

1091
01:17:31,458 --> 01:17:33,874
l have something for you...

1092
01:17:36,666 --> 01:17:40,040
- You're distractinG me.
- What a pain!

1093
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,749
This is for Jessica, study it,
even toniGht.

1094
01:17:44,916 --> 01:17:47,124
lt's a musical, listen to it.

1095
01:17:47,875 --> 01:17:50,290
l'm crazy about Miss Quagliarulo.

1096
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:52,040
Crazy, crazy...

1097
01:17:53,416 --> 01:17:54,832
A thousand times crazy...

1098
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:29,832
Raindrops keep fallinG on my head,

1099
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:36,249
it was serene
until two minutes ago,

1100
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:39,874
then, who knows how,

1101
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:43,874
the sky started feelinG like me

1102
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:46,874
and l feel...

1103
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:49,707
Raindrops on my neck
and on my hands,

1104
01:18:50,791 --> 01:18:54,957
tiny shivers makinG me feel,
l don't know how,

1105
01:18:56,666 --> 01:18:59,124
the sensation that

1106
01:18:59,833 --> 01:19:03,457
l'm naked among people
who don't notice,

1107
01:19:04,375 --> 01:19:06,040
they're cryinG.

1108
01:19:06,333 --> 01:19:08,624
And in you

1109
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:13,457
there's a storm,

1110
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:15,874
making you feel bad,

1111
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:19,124
but you're free

1112
01:19:19,375 --> 01:19:22,374
and as you see,
you're still standing.

1113
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:52,790
Someone will dry me off.

1114
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:05,040
As soon as you're down,
don't move a muscle.

1115
01:20:39,166 --> 01:20:40,415
Good moon.

1116
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,082
Where did you go?

1117
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:48,124
l said:
l'll drop in on Letizia and...

1118
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:51,040
l did.

1119
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:55,665
You live here,
but l never see you.

1120
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:00,040
lt's not that...

1121
01:21:01,458 --> 01:21:03,374
you've met some pretty Countess?

1122
01:21:08,666 --> 01:21:10,874
l don't like them,

1123
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:13,499
they're fake, artificial...

1124
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:16,374
sugarcoated.

1125
01:21:20,458 --> 01:21:22,665
l like women who...

1126
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:29,540
touch rose petals
with their fingers, who smile,

1127
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:33,915
who put their hand
to their throats.

1128
01:21:36,041 --> 01:21:37,499
And who...

1129
01:22:18,666 --> 01:22:20,040
We have to talk.

1130
01:22:21,625 --> 01:22:24,249
When a woman says that,
l get worried.

1131
01:22:26,666 --> 01:22:30,040
- You're marrying Gherets?
- No, that's not it.

1132
01:22:32,875 --> 01:22:34,707
Would you like to eat?

1133
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:36,999
Help me out?

1134
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,165
l'll make an omelet.

1135
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:44,499
You...

1136
01:22:46,458 --> 01:22:48,290
Beat the eggs.

1137
01:22:49,458 --> 01:22:51,040
l'll cut the zucchini.

1138
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:53,874
Or you can cut the zucchini
and l'll beat the egGs?

1139
01:22:54,083 --> 01:22:56,332
No, l'll beat the eGgs.

1140
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:11,290
Maybe you'd better
break them open.

1141
01:23:11,875 --> 01:23:14,290
- Think so?
- l'd say...

1142
01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:20,665
Why don't we...
now that you're here, let's toast.

1143
01:23:20,875 --> 01:23:22,499
Alright.

1144
01:23:28,666 --> 01:23:30,665
Me too, l discovered late

1145
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:33,874
you need eGgs to make an omelet.

1146
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,915
Usually, after a toast
there's a kiss.

1147
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:56,040
Why should we?

1148
01:23:56,291 --> 01:23:58,082
There's no photoGrapher.

1149
01:23:58,875 --> 01:24:01,040
What do you mean?

1150
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:03,707
Every time we've kissed,
there's always a photographer.

1151
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:07,249
l know you need me for charity,

1152
01:24:10,250 --> 01:24:12,457
because you have to become famous.

1153
01:24:20,708 --> 01:24:22,332
l'm sorry.

1154
01:24:24,666 --> 01:24:27,499
l'm ashamed, I was wronG, l know.

1155
01:24:32,625 --> 01:24:33,999
l was about to say it.

1156
01:24:35,666 --> 01:24:38,499
When? lt's been two months.

1157
01:24:40,166 --> 01:24:42,290
l don't want
to be made fun of anymore.

1158
01:24:43,875 --> 01:24:45,499
Yes, but...

1159
01:24:47,458 --> 01:24:51,457
now I could fall in love with you.

1160
01:24:53,041 --> 01:24:54,874
Now l could...

1161
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:57,082
Stop this!

1162
01:24:58,000 --> 01:24:59,665
Why be like this?

1163
01:25:01,041 --> 01:25:03,707
- Because we're different.
- No, we aren't!

1164
01:25:04,875 --> 01:25:06,415
You've learned to be at court!

1165
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:09,624
l learned your ways,
but you haven't learned mine.

1166
01:25:09,833 --> 01:25:12,665
lf l asked you to live my life,
how would you take it?

1167
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:17,249
Like that, don't say a word,
l understand everything.

1168
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,082
We're different.

1169
01:25:20,875 --> 01:25:24,290
What an ugly word "different",
it means not to love,

1170
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:28,124
it's love that makes us equals,
right?

1171
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:32,290
What a stranGe fate you all have,

1172
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,499
you call yourselves reGal

1173
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:37,082
yet you're so far from reality.

1174
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:23,457
Antonio found out.

1175
01:26:25,666 --> 01:26:27,290
l know.

1176
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:36,499
We failed. l wanted to chanGe him,
but he chanGed me.

1177
01:26:44,625 --> 01:26:45,874
Wait.

1178
01:26:49,125 --> 01:26:50,790
This is from Antonio.

1179
01:27:07,666 --> 01:27:11,499
Love is that instant
that can't wait even a second,

1180
01:27:11,708 --> 01:27:15,332
that chases the minutes,
even sixty times

1181
01:27:15,541 --> 01:27:18,124
until the time comes to see you.

1182
01:27:18,375 --> 01:27:20,582
Love is that silver knot

1183
01:27:20,791 --> 01:27:23,790
that ties eyes to heart,
insolubly.

1184
01:27:24,458 --> 01:27:27,874
Everything the heart looks at,
is seen throuGh the eyes

1185
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:31,707
and everythinG the eyes see,
is looked at by the heart.

1186
01:27:32,666 --> 01:27:35,040
And now that l know
all these thinGs,

1187
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:37,707
protect me, defend me,

1188
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:40,457
l want to trust you

1189
01:27:40,666 --> 01:27:44,082
one more time,
my love.

1190
01:29:53,041 --> 01:29:54,290
Bro!

1191
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:57,082
See who's there?
The prince!

1192
01:29:57,333 --> 01:30:00,249
- Oh, shut up!
- You shut up!

1193
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,665
lt's really beautiful.

1194
01:30:02,875 --> 01:30:06,290
l'm glad you came to the opening,
but l gotta go now.

1195
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,165
l decided to chanGe my life,

1196
01:30:08,416 --> 01:30:11,624
since we got back from the castle,
new life, diet...

1197
01:30:11,875 --> 01:30:15,040
The dietician said 100 grams
of bread at most, that's 150.

1198
01:30:15,291 --> 01:30:17,082
C'mon, just 50 Grams more!

1199
01:30:17,333 --> 01:30:19,749
Either you're
on a diet or you aren't.

1200
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:22,040
Now it's 100 Grams.

1201
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:24,999
You know what l can do
to lose weiGht?

1202
01:30:25,250 --> 01:30:27,540
Bring a nice Gym into the house.

1203
01:30:27,708 --> 01:30:31,790
Ciro, to lose weight,
don't brinG in a gym,

1204
01:30:31,958 --> 01:30:34,165
take out the kitchen.

1205
01:30:34,416 --> 01:30:37,415
- Can we take a nice photo of us?
- Go ahead!

1206
01:30:37,625 --> 01:30:39,832
- What?
- l told you, he's not the prince.

1207
01:30:40,083 --> 01:30:43,749
- Want one of me?
- You won't fit in here!

1208
01:30:43,958 --> 01:30:46,540
You never do what I say!

1209
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:48,832
Never, never...

1210
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:51,290
Remember me?

1211
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:55,874
l'm the coffee machine technician,
l came here last month.

1212
01:30:56,541 --> 01:30:59,415
l was passing by and said:
l'll taste the coffee,

1213
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:01,790
but won't take a cent.

1214
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:04,624
Technician?
The technician's right in there.

1215
01:31:09,375 --> 01:31:11,749

1216
01:31:12,541 --> 01:31:15,540
Who cares?
The technician's already here.

1217
01:31:23,541 --> 01:31:24,999
ColleaGue...

1218
01:31:47,416 --> 01:31:49,040
Where should l take you?

1219
01:31:52,375 --> 01:31:53,999
But I...

1220
01:31:56,166 --> 01:31:58,540
also have a license
to taste chocolates.

1221
01:32:01,208 --> 01:32:04,790
To taste the best chocolate
in Naples, come with me.

1222
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:16,999
This mortgaGe is perfect
for your two-room apartment.

1223
01:32:17,208 --> 01:32:20,207
Fine, thank you,
you've been very clear.

1224
01:32:20,416 --> 01:32:23,582
May I offer a chocolate?
The chocolatier is excellent.

1225
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,415
Thank you.

1226
01:32:34,708 --> 01:32:36,957
l don't believe
you want to live like me.

1227
01:32:37,166 --> 01:32:39,999
Months learning to mooch
and you still don't believe me?

1228
01:32:40,791 --> 01:32:41,874
No.

1229
01:32:43,208 --> 01:32:46,582
l want to spend all my days
with you, all of them,

1230
01:32:46,791 --> 01:32:48,457
every moment,

1231
01:32:48,625 --> 01:32:50,624
l want to share
my breath with you.

1232
01:32:50,833 --> 01:32:53,290
l want to love you forever too,

1233
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:57,332
but the hard thinG is to love
every day, in simplicity.

1234
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,665
l want us to love
each other forever,

1235
01:32:59,875 --> 01:33:01,874
l want us to argue
over the toothpaste,

1236
01:33:02,083 --> 01:33:06,290
or because l don't shop well.

1237
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:09,540
l want you to see bacteria
everywhere when you clean

1238
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:11,749
the house,
in the bathroom, the kitchen,

1239
01:33:11,833 --> 01:33:15,124
and before l come in,
the bacteria looks at me and says:

1240
01:33:15,333 --> 01:33:17,165
that Guy's Gonna catch hell!

1241
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:19,749
l want to love you forever,

1242
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,999
l even want you to vacuum
during the Naples Games...

1243
01:33:24,166 --> 01:33:26,540
But only the Championship ones!

1244
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:28,665
l want...

1245
01:33:28,875 --> 01:33:31,124
l want you off my boat,

1246
01:33:31,333 --> 01:33:34,249
if not l'll be GettinG it
from my wife.

1247
01:33:42,333 --> 01:33:43,957
Who are these people?

1248
01:33:44,166 --> 01:33:47,249
- Excuse me, who are you?
- The witnesses.

1249
01:33:47,458 --> 01:33:48,957
For the bride or groom?

1250
01:33:49,166 --> 01:33:52,540
For the accident, we helped them
Get the money for their wedding.

1251
01:33:52,750 --> 01:33:54,749
Let me say hello to the bride.

1252
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,790
A toast!

1253
01:33:57,041 --> 01:33:59,624
A toast to the bride, hurrah!

1254
01:34:07,958 --> 01:34:11,374
The sfogliatelle,
sugar-coated almonds...

1255
01:34:11,541 --> 01:34:13,999
Aren't you the princess?

1256
01:34:14,166 --> 01:34:16,540
Yes, but don't tell a soul.

1257
01:34:16,708 --> 01:34:20,165
Sure!
Ciro, we won't tell a soul.

1258
01:34:20,375 --> 01:34:24,374
l'm a dimwit, think l'd say:
the princess is here!

1259
01:34:29,125 --> 01:34:31,415
Stop, wait.

1260
01:34:42,208 --> 01:34:44,415
Antonio, a photo!

1261
01:34:44,583 --> 01:34:46,457
Stop riGht there!

1262
01:34:46,625 --> 01:34:49,499
Excuse me, but who are you?

1263
01:34:49,666 --> 01:34:52,124
We're the sinGers' manaGers.

1264
01:34:53,708 --> 01:34:55,374
They're coming.

1265
01:34:55,541 --> 01:34:57,415
They took me for a hat rack!

1266
01:34:58,541 --> 01:35:00,749
Ladies and Gentlemen!

1267
01:35:01,958 --> 01:35:03,957
A great honor,

1268
01:35:04,166 --> 01:35:08,540
the princess made an omelet
with her own hands.

1269
01:35:18,291 --> 01:35:20,207
The sinGers are here.

1270
01:35:20,416 --> 01:35:22,582
- What?
- The singers.

1271
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:26,082
So, ladies and gentlemen,

1272
01:35:26,291 --> 01:35:29,290
<i>last but not least, the singers!</i>

1273
01:35:50,166 --> 01:35:53,165
<i>You are distant from my heart...</i>

1274
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:57,249
<i>My thouGht flies to you...</i>

1275
01:35:57,458 --> 01:36:00,707
<i>l want for nothing,
hope for nothing,</i>

1276
01:36:00,958 --> 01:36:03,957
<i>but to keep you forever
by my side.</i>

1277
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,207
<i>Feel sure of this love...</i>

1278
01:36:08,958 --> 01:36:11,957
<i>Just as l am sure of you.</i>

1279
01:36:15,875 --> 01:36:19,332
<i>Oh my life, oh life of mine,</i>

1280
01:36:19,541 --> 01:36:22,249
<i>heart of this heart of mine,</i>

1281
01:36:23,041 --> 01:36:26,249
<i>you were my first love,</i>

1282
01:36:26,458 --> 01:36:29,290
<i>and will always be
my first and last love.</i>

1283
01:36:31,958 --> 01:36:33,749
So we'll be living in Naples?

1284
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:37,999
Yes, how can the people love you
if you don't live amonG them?

1285
01:36:39,166 --> 01:36:41,749
But sometimes we'll visit
your father at the castle,

1286
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:46,207
like for the holidays: Christmas,
New Year's, Easter, Carnival.

1287
01:36:46,416 --> 01:36:48,415
lnstead of cominG here
to the beach in July and AuGust,

1288
01:36:48,583 --> 01:36:50,457
we'll Go to the pool
at the castle,

1289
01:36:50,625 --> 01:36:53,499
even if the best months
are June and September.

1290
01:36:53,666 --> 01:36:55,874
So, we'll move into my place?

1291
01:36:56,541 --> 01:36:59,540
l want the kids
to Grow up in Naples.

1292
01:37:01,166 --> 01:37:03,374
But we can Go from time to time.

1293
01:37:04,166 --> 01:37:06,165
And mooch off dad.

1294
01:37:07,375 --> 01:37:08,749
My love...

1295
01:41:44,375 --> 01:41:50,832
GOOD MOON
