1
00:01:26,844 --> 00:01:28,356
Do not forget your papers.

2
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:31,379
Everything is good.

3
00:01:32,984 --> 00:01:36,084
No reason to be nervous.
- I'm not nervous.

4
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:41,009
You look really handsome today.
- I gotta go.

5
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:44,067
I have to work late tonight.
Your lunch is in the refrigerator.

6
00:01:45,763 --> 00:01:48,363
Give me a kiss.
- Mom, I would prefer ...

7
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,603
Go ahead, otherwise you will still be late.

8
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:33,327
Okay people, sit down.
We have much work to do today.

9
00:02:33,577 --> 00:02:36,998
We begin where we stopped yesterday
with physics projects.

10
00:02:37,248 --> 00:02:42,636
Remember to people. This contract,
counts for 50% extra for your figure.

11
00:02:42,886 --> 00:02:45,673
So if I turn a light
battery see,

12
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:49,923
or a volcano with bath salts.
I'll send you back to the second class.

13
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:56,925
What can I do for you?

14
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,992
I'm new.

15
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:01,043
Welcome.

16
00:03:03,073 --> 00:03:05,793
Just wait, come here.
I would like to introduce you nicely.

17
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:08,830
Everyone.
This is Kyle Barrett.

18
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,728
Where are you from Kyle?

19
00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:13,897
Everywhere and nowhere.

20
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:18,651
Okay, I believe I have ever been.
A couple of times.

21
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:20,749
Find a spot.

22
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:22,844
Okay everyone, back to work.

23
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:26,447
Look where we are now,
with our projects.

24
00:03:26,797 --> 00:03:32,947
We ended yesterday with Cindy.
And today we start with Jason Mclntyre.

25
00:03:33,337 --> 00:03:34,704
Come forward Jason.

26
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,237
Stop laughing.
There is nothing funny to.

27
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:52,226
Sit still, please.

28
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:56,109
Jason, what happened?

29
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:03,112
I stumbled.

30
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,349
It was an accident.

31
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:08,301
He did it.

32
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:10,808
Sorry.

33
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:12,416
He let him stumble.

34
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:17,458
Is that true?

35
00:04:21,352 --> 00:04:24,565
Jason is that true?

36
00:04:28,526 --> 00:04:29,910
He lies.

37
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,202
Richard, you go directly
to the office of Mr. Armstrong.

38
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,580
I do so.
- What a nonsense.

39
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:37,412
Now, I said.

40
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,019
They lie.

41
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:40,681
Go.

42
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:50,431
Everyone stay calm and remain seated.
We go back to our work.

43
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:52,029
You're dead.

44
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:57,594
You picked the bucket, what David suit
paper wipes, everyone remains seated.

45
00:05:14,707 --> 00:05:17,657
You go pay,
because you helped him in the classroom.

46
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:21,039
McIntyre?

47
00:05:25,516 --> 00:05:26,866
Guys, please

48
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:29,557
Hey bag.

49
00:05:33,357 --> 00:05:34,876
I'm suspended for two weeks.

50
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,676
Any idea,
what my old man is going to do with me?

51
00:05:38,295 --> 00:05:39,684
This.

52
00:05:48,205 --> 00:05:50,454
Hey, I'm still not ready.

53
00:05:58,048 --> 00:05:59,387
Get him, Rick.

54
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:15,315
I grab him, keep him quiet.

55
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:32,691
Kyle watch out.

56
00:07:00,944 --> 00:07:02,274
I'm Jason.

57
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:04,552
Jason McIntyre.

58
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:18,204
Hey, where did you learn to fight?

59
00:07:32,376 --> 00:07:33,808
What do you want from me?

60
00:07:34,878 --> 00:07:37,978
I want to thank you.
You know and ...

61
00:07:40,785 --> 00:07:44,685
I thought maybe we could be friends.
Or something.

62
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:52,004
You should not let you fool,
by those guys.

63
00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:56,428
I know.

64
00:08:00,571 --> 00:08:02,560
I think,
which I boy who got his nose broken.

65
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,690
Really?
- Yes, I think so.

66
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:13,696
I have lived a while in Denver.

67
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:15,793
Have you ever been?

68
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:21,136
There I lived
in San Antonio in Texas.

69
00:08:22,092 --> 00:08:25,992
And in Chicago.
Since I was born.

70
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,155
Have you ever been?

71
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,117
You traveled around a lot.
Why?

72
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,172
No idea.
- What does your father?

73
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,255
I have no father.

74
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,329
Actually ...
Somehow, I think.

75
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,899
I've never met him.

76
00:09:00,431 --> 00:09:02,014
This is Jack.

77
00:09:02,966 --> 00:09:04,360
Who is Jack?

78
00:09:05,802 --> 00:09:07,267
Rick's brother.

79
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,888
Are you new?

80
00:09:44,742 --> 00:09:46,431
Are you the brother of the nursery?

81
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,136
He said you two,
with a few friends, have robbed him.

82
00:09:58,655 --> 00:10:00,274
That is not,
how I remember.

83
00:10:00,524 --> 00:10:04,224
You call my brother a liar?
- Yes, absolutely.

84
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:08,861
Listen codger.

85
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:13,634
Let me tell you something,
what everyone in this stupid town already knows.

86
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:18,389
Nobody, except me, save my brother.

87
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,118
You understand that?

88
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,503
Catch them, let them not escape.

89
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:43,594
Here is your chain, bastard.

90
00:10:45,235 --> 00:10:46,547
You ball ...

91
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:51,338
Dirk, get in the car.
- Jack, is it?

92
00:11:02,086 --> 00:11:04,564
They, in our view, get out.

93
00:11:10,661 --> 00:11:12,810
They are not killed,
I do not want any trouble.

94
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:18,261
Here he comes.

95
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:32,495
We drive too fast man, driving slowly.
- Slow down, Jack.

96
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,334
Faster.

97
00:11:47,264 --> 00:11:49,074
Jack, what are you gonna do?

98
00:11:56,107 --> 00:11:59,660
Slower.
- Jack, let it sit, okay?

99
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:02,360
We deal with them tomorrow.
- Shut up.

100
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,470
Watch out for that truck.

101
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:20,845
Come on, back there.

102
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:26,266
I go with him.
- Keep you sit.

103
00:12:26,516 --> 00:12:27,845
Jack, please.

104
00:12:29,306 --> 00:12:32,056
Sorry.
- Get outta here here.

105
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,780
Watch out.
From the road.

106
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:44,218
Sorry.

107
00:12:47,123 --> 00:12:48,435
Get out.

108
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:52,978
Road, going from the road.

109
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:11,644
Man, you almost hit him.
- Almost.

110
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:17,688
Where?
- There is a ski jump.

111
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:22,238
We try to jump over the canal.
Nobody has ever tried.

112
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:37,614
That never succeed.

113
00:13:42,346 --> 00:13:44,564
If we do not go fast enough,
we get it.

114
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:50,368
They are dead.
- That there has been.

115
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,560
Holy ...
- Hell.

116
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,510
It is our success.

117
00:14:14,945 --> 00:14:16,784
I'm going to murder that child.

118
00:14:18,282 --> 00:14:21,335
That was crazy man.
- No one will believe us.

119
00:14:21,585 --> 00:14:23,052
There were witnesses at.

120
00:14:23,687 --> 00:14:26,987
Who, these two idiots?
That will not repeat.

121
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:29,772
Yes, you're right.

122
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:34,882
Man, we jumped on the channel.
Maybe someone has seen us.

123
00:14:35,132 --> 00:14:38,382
Nobody saw it.
- So we must do it again.

124
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:41,819
Just do again.
- I do not yet agree.

125
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,640
Where are we going?
- I see you so well.

126
00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:51,425
Look.

127
00:14:52,783 --> 00:14:56,133
Hello Uncle Ed.
- Hey partner, no problem, I hope?

128
00:14:56,782 --> 00:14:58,972
Well.
- Something to drink?

129
00:14:59,222 --> 00:15:00,561
Thank you.

130
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:08,745
Who is your friend?
- This is Kyle, he's new in the city.

131
00:15:11,768 --> 00:15:13,125
Is this your plane?

132
00:15:14,104 --> 00:15:15,806
Uncle Ed save for their own plane.

133
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:17,634
Do you like airplanes?

134
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,683
No idea.

135
00:15:23,613 --> 00:15:24,954
No idea?

136
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:29,896
I've never flown.

137
00:15:45,803 --> 00:15:48,822
Do you do this often?
- As often as I can.

138
00:15:49,072 --> 00:15:51,936
I may never my mother,
they hate flying.

139
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,175
Why is that?
- I do not know.

140
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:09,655
My grandfather was pilot,
in the Second World War.

141
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:14,227
He shot down 17 enemy planes.
He is a hero.

142
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,418
He is alive,
if you want, you can meet him.

143
00:16:24,841 --> 00:16:26,173
Again.

144
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,130
We are far too late for dinner.

145
00:17:08,718 --> 00:17:11,572
Thank you Uncle Ed.
- Yes, thank you Mr. Thomas.

146
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,447
It is all right, let's say Ed.

147
00:17:19,362 --> 00:17:22,217
Say no to your mother,
I've flown with you.

148
00:17:22,467 --> 00:17:26,517
Love you kidding me?
- And certainly say nothing about that spin.

149
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,955
Or about those somersault.

150
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:30,662
Or that nosedive.

151
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,298
Shall we again tomorrow?
- And the school then?

152
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,730
We have no school tomorrow.

153
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:43,518
Is that so?
- Yes, teachers consultations.

154
00:17:44,954 --> 00:17:46,274
Really, huh?

155
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:50,274
Okay, come to seven hours to the airport.
- Seven o'clock in the morning?

156
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,023
Yes, we are going to make a couple's somersault
and ensure that you are at school on time.

157
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:58,049
Nice to meet you Kyle.
- Yes, same to you.

158
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:07,072
Hey, make sure your nose clean.
- We are not ready for eight hours.

159
00:18:09,946 --> 00:18:12,065
Did your uncle with your impact?
- Of course not.

160
00:18:12,315 --> 00:18:15,365
This is Kyle, he's new here.
We have great hunger.

161
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:21,341
Stop blowing bubbles, baby.
- This is already two months on date.

162
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:23,836
If there is no mold on state
it is still good.

163
00:18:25,362 --> 00:18:27,680
Katie, if you do not stop,
there is no puppy.

164
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:32,853
Who said anything about a puppy?
- Hey, we can call him Ace?

165
00:18:33,103 --> 00:18:35,889
That is a stupid name.
- So they called Grandpa.

166
00:18:36,139 --> 00:18:37,524
Okay, we are still talking about it.

167
00:18:37,774 --> 00:18:40,260
Like Grandpa wants, that a dog
is named after him, little gay.

168
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,710
Sorry, what?
Such words we use here.

169
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:46,495
What's a gay?

170
00:18:48,351 --> 00:18:51,738
This is not just word.
See what you did?

171
00:18:51,988 --> 00:18:53,840
You would be an example
for her to be.

172
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,740
Can I maybe some chicken?
- Of course, grab a drum stick.

173
00:18:58,028 --> 00:18:59,458
There is also still a pup.

174
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:07,007
He does not talk more,
since he has the surgery twice.

175
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:11,169
That is okay, he talked not much anyway.

176
00:19:11,808 --> 00:19:13,758
He was always on the veranda
and smoked a lot.

177
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:18,611
I do not know why they bring him his meals.
He almost never eat something.

178
00:19:24,921 --> 00:19:26,237
Grandpa.

179
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:31,017
Here is your food.

180
00:19:34,097 --> 00:19:35,406
Are you hungry?

181
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,678
You want some water.

182
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:55,769
See you there.

183
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:59,169
That he received for saving a pilot,
when they were both shot.

184
00:20:01,257 --> 00:20:04,487
He took it from there sometimes,
for them to show me.

185
00:20:05,228 --> 00:20:06,955
Then we began to polish them.

186
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:10,982
You had me today
not only must leave behind.

187
00:20:13,002 --> 00:20:16,256
Since that alley.
When that thing with Jack.

188
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,134
You had no way to go.

189
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:23,119
I'm sorry.

190
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:29,530
I thought that you have saved.
And did you, or not? You came out.

191
00:20:29,952 --> 00:20:31,767
And if I did not
road could have been?

192
00:20:33,123 --> 00:20:36,773
Earlier at school, I helped you.
You had to help me.

193
00:20:38,495 --> 00:20:43,095
I'm sorry.
I was scared.

194
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:45,345
I'm sorry.

195
00:20:45,836 --> 00:20:49,686
It is all right.
We have reports, or not?

196
00:21:03,186 --> 00:21:04,725
Are we already in the area, Kyle?

197
00:21:06,286 --> 00:21:08,630
It's here somewhere.

198
00:21:12,426 --> 00:21:16,966
That one, with the lights on.
- Is that your house?

199
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:21,501
Are you sure?
- Yes, that's him.

200
00:21:37,687 --> 00:21:39,135
Thank you.

201
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,642
Today I had great fun.
- Me, too.

202
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:48,842
See you tomorrow morning.

203
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:52,216
Are you here, or at the airport?

204
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:56,470
I see you in the channel.

205
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:06,579
Nice to meet you Kyle.
- Nice to meet you.

206
00:22:41,685 --> 00:22:44,935
Sorry I'm late.
- Ready to go?

207
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,161
I have taken walkie-talkies.

208
00:22:49,592 --> 00:22:51,104
Let us now but around bicycles.

209
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:04,504
This is so cool.
Owns one of your uncle here?

210
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:06,722
No, he maintains them alone.

211
00:23:08,978 --> 00:23:10,437
Hey, come take a look.

212
00:23:15,885 --> 00:23:19,635
Can this be?
- Yes, everyone here knows me, I'll do this more often.

213
00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:26,546
Is it difficult to fly?
- No, Ed taught me how.

214
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:28,144
He takes me everywhere.

215
00:23:29,966 --> 00:23:32,163
You want something really gaafs see?

216
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,737
Where are we going?
- Wait and see.

217
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,298
What are you doing?

218
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:07,851
That is so cool.
- Great, huh.

219
00:24:19,315 --> 00:24:22,365
What type is it?

220
00:24:24,187 --> 00:24:25,945
Wait until you see the cockpit.

221
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,249
Wait.

222
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,860
Are you sure this is okay?
- Sure. Here is none.

223
00:24:42,505 --> 00:24:46,105
Look.
- It looks like a camper or something.

224
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:48,424
Yes, come inside.

225
00:24:57,653 --> 00:25:01,274
Do not. Nowhere in print.
- Calm down, I do nothing.

226
00:25:01,524 --> 00:25:02,983
Not start, okay?

227
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,110
Want to see what gaafs?
Put your hand on it.

228
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,444
Look at the wings.

229
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:20,091
What have you done?
- Nothing.

230
00:25:23,015 --> 00:25:24,365
Hide.

231
00:25:32,689 --> 00:25:35,241
That is probably the owner, we gotta get outta here.
- No, they will see us.

232
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:38,168
Hide it.
Fast.

233
00:25:46,903 --> 00:25:48,431
The walkietalkie.

234
00:25:58,815 --> 00:26:02,715
We gotta get outta here.
And what if he goes off?

235
00:26:04,387 --> 00:26:06,269
They probably just find something.

236
00:26:25,608 --> 00:26:27,070
They go off

237
00:26:32,248 --> 00:26:33,587
It is time to go.

238
00:26:47,663 --> 00:26:49,225
They have weapons.

239
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:00,692
What should we do?

240
00:27:19,762 --> 00:27:22,662
What do you think we go?
- No idea.

241
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:27,916
There is always something bad happens,
if you spijbelt.

242
00:28:13,949 --> 00:28:15,288
What do you see?

243
00:28:15,952 --> 00:28:17,461
There are still more.

244
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,529
Where are we?

245
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:21,928
I do not know.

246
00:28:34,603 --> 00:28:37,653
Are we on car?
- Are you crazy.

247
00:28:53,923 --> 00:28:55,737
Maybe now we fly back.

248
00:28:56,258 --> 00:28:57,567
Maybe.

249
00:30:01,357 --> 00:30:02,673
Wake up.

250
00:30:04,894 --> 00:30:06,490
Come on, wake up.

251
00:30:12,501 --> 00:30:13,924
What time is it?

252
00:30:14,336 --> 00:30:17,268
I need to find the bathroom,
I needed to pee.

253
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,700
I am hungry.

254
00:30:22,311 --> 00:30:23,957
Would this be something to eat?

255
00:30:41,997 --> 00:30:43,320
Come here.

256
00:30:49,705 --> 00:30:51,387
Is that what I think it is?

257
00:30:58,581 --> 00:30:59,909
Where's the door?

258
00:31:00,783 --> 00:31:02,111
No idea.

259
00:31:02,985 --> 00:31:04,381
Where is everybody?

260
00:31:05,521 --> 00:31:08,271
I do not know.
We tell the pilot, fast.

261
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:20,720
You should fly.
- I can not fly.

262
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,222
You said you could fly.
- No, not this one.

263
00:31:23,472 --> 00:31:26,259
He is huge, there are too many buttons.
This is not the same.

264
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,135
You gotta fly, otherwise we die.

265
00:31:28,778 --> 00:31:30,106
And that bomb then?

266
00:31:30,947 --> 00:31:33,192
You fly, and I care for the bomb.

267
00:31:39,054 --> 00:31:40,418
I can not fly.

268
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:45,908
SOS.
Help, please.

269
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:51,450
My name is Jason McIntyre.
I'm just a kid.

270
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,750
Hello, help me.
Can anybody hear me?

271
00:31:55,184 --> 00:31:57,224
What are you doing?
- I have the bomb.

272
00:31:57,474 --> 00:31:59,692
And that drag you here?
- What should I do with it then?

273
00:31:59,942 --> 00:32:03,042
Sucker away with it.
- Outdoor throw?

274
00:32:04,113 --> 00:32:05,695
Help me, please.

275
00:32:14,023 --> 00:32:17,023
SOS.
Is there someone, anyone hear me?

276
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:20,168
Are you lost him?

277
00:32:34,043 --> 00:32:36,383
Can anybody hear me?
Is anybody there?

278
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:39,683
Answer.
Please, is there anyone?

279
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,989
Is anybody there?

280
00:32:43,786 --> 00:32:47,236
I think that we will get that mountain.
Jason, I think it is.

281
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,378
Well then.

282
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:00,349
What should we do?
- We must act.

283
00:33:02,805 --> 00:33:04,421
Pull on, hurry up.

284
00:33:18,584 --> 00:33:20,234
You must help me.

285
00:33:27,963 --> 00:33:30,850
What are you doing?
- I try him stabilization.

286
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,786
What should I do?
- Take off your belt to.

287
00:33:34,036 --> 00:33:35,803
Help me to stabilize him.

288
00:33:39,942 --> 00:33:42,799
That is too many.
- Go right.

289
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,536
We need countries,
for we have no more fuel.

290
00:33:50,786 --> 00:33:53,986
Where do we land?
- On an airport or a road.

291
00:33:56,525 --> 00:33:57,998
I see neither.

292
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,710
I see a road,
further to the left.

293
00:34:01,197 --> 00:34:02,647
Slow.

294
00:34:12,007 --> 00:34:13,616
I pull him right.

295
00:34:16,779 --> 00:34:18,998
And what now.
- I know a lot.

296
00:34:19,248 --> 00:34:23,002
What does Ed, before he lands?
- I do not know anymore.

297
00:34:23,252 --> 00:34:24,802
Come on,
which buttons to press him?

298
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:28,770
Landing.
Look at something that state.

299
00:34:29,691 --> 00:34:32,541
Okay, I got it.
Should I print out?

300
00:34:35,397 --> 00:34:36,779
And now?

301
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:40,633
The flaps should be lowered.
- Press?

302
00:34:46,541 --> 00:34:48,388
We drive a plane.

303
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,865
What was that?

304
00:34:53,115 --> 00:34:54,433
Turbulence.

305
00:34:54,683 --> 00:34:56,072
I hope.

306
00:34:56,952 --> 00:34:58,577
Are you sure that this is going to succeed?

307
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:01,031
There are too many cars,
this does not succeed.

308
00:35:08,798 --> 00:35:13,148
I hope that those cars we see coming.
- Of course it does, here we go.

309
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:15,249
There are too many cars.

310
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:19,205
We're going too fast.
- I know.

311
00:35:23,212 --> 00:35:25,131
Are those cars still on the side?
- I do not know.

312
00:35:25,381 --> 00:35:26,756
From the road.

313
00:35:31,186 --> 00:35:33,236
Keep him stable.
- That I try, help me.

314
00:35:40,796 --> 00:35:42,144
On the side.

315
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:48,342
And back to right now.

316
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,231
We have no horn or something?
- Airplanes have no horn.

317
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:01,981
From the road.

318
00:36:15,064 --> 00:36:17,126
Watch out for that truck.

319
00:36:30,145 --> 00:36:32,495
Trap on the brake.
- He does not stop.

320
00:36:38,086 --> 00:36:40,186
This thing has no brakes?
- Stop.

321
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:57,586
We are like this.

322
00:36:59,608 --> 00:37:03,808
Is everything okay?
- I do not think I need more to the bathroom.

323
00:37:14,121 --> 00:37:16,121
Thank you!
- Would you like coffee?

324
00:37:18,293 --> 00:37:19,837
Can I take your order record, sir?

325
00:37:20,862 --> 00:37:24,612
Wake up please.
- That very sorry. Is it?

326
00:37:24,947 --> 00:37:26,259
Does it hurt?

327
00:37:27,002 --> 00:37:29,102
I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

328
00:37:30,072 --> 00:37:34,922
Can you see anything?
- No, not really.

329
00:37:35,944 --> 00:37:38,241
But I can call an ambulance,
if you want.

330
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:46,400
Would you like coffee?
- Yes, one liter or four, if possible.

331
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,237
Thank you!

332
00:38:04,173 --> 00:38:05,480
Milk?

333
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:08,758
Sugar?
- No, thank you

334
00:38:12,448 --> 00:38:13,928
Would you order something?

335
00:38:19,021 --> 00:38:20,468
Surprise me.

336
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:27,359
This is a fantastic story boys,
can you tell what happened?

337
00:38:28,797 --> 00:38:32,547
We were on board
and suddenly there was no pilot more ....

338
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,388
That is my son
- That is my cousin.

339
00:38:41,143 --> 00:38:43,443
And Jason was in the cockpit ...

340
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,780
Jason, how can you have countries?

341
00:38:47,517 --> 00:38:51,736
Kyle threw the bomb out
and helped me in the cockpit.

342
00:38:51,986 --> 00:38:55,623
And helped me to have a mountain to fly.
- Hello Jason.

343
00:38:57,226 --> 00:39:00,779
The plane will remain here,
the owner is known.

344
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:06,385
We take the two boys in custody,
they did something that clearly was not.

345
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,054
There is no evidence,
that there were problems with this plane.

346
00:39:09,304 --> 00:39:13,354
There is no evidence of a crime.
- One of ours?

347
00:39:14,342 --> 00:39:18,392
The police are still mistrustful ...
- Those kids are super.

348
00:39:19,214 --> 00:39:21,733
We think that there are about four million
on board was this week.

349
00:39:21,983 --> 00:39:25,871
Most comes from the casino.
There is nothing found on board.

350
00:39:26,121 --> 00:39:29,208
Find out who did this.
- That all may have been Angelo.

351
00:39:29,458 --> 00:39:32,958
Search Carmine.
And call my brother.

352
00:39:34,096 --> 00:39:36,615
The police is outside,
the plane leads to you.

353
00:39:36,865 --> 00:39:38,317
They want a few questions.

354
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:43,722
Super, keep them busy Sal,
make them a couple sandwiches, or something.

355
00:39:43,972 --> 00:39:46,222
Okay, I call Silvio.
- Good.

356
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:49,157
I want my plane back.

357
00:39:49,945 --> 00:39:52,045
I want to know who did this,
so I 'm can be murder.

358
00:39:53,048 --> 00:39:54,722
And I also want to talk with those guys.

359
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,889
That is regulated.

360
00:40:00,088 --> 00:40:02,975
We have been there.
- This is unbelievable.

361
00:40:03,225 --> 00:40:04,598
What should we do?

362
00:40:05,527 --> 00:40:06,905
What should we do, man?

363
00:40:25,547 --> 00:40:27,237
Silvio, where have you been?

364
00:40:31,435 --> 00:40:33,485
Silvio, where are you?

365
00:40:34,222 --> 00:40:36,275
Listen. Kloten man.

366
00:40:36,525 --> 00:40:38,875
Lenny and I were from
and we missed the plane.

367
00:40:39,194 --> 00:40:42,414
You know what happened?
- Only that what I saw on the news.

368
00:40:42,664 --> 00:40:45,351
What is wrong?
Do you know who did this?

369
00:40:45,601 --> 00:40:48,387
Not yet.
- Can I do something?

370
00:40:48,637 --> 00:40:50,304
Yes, I want you to come here.

371
00:40:53,709 --> 00:40:56,259
To the house?
- Yes, to the house.

372
00:40:57,479 --> 00:40:59,398
I am currently not
whom I have confidence.

373
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:03,998
It may have been an inside job.
I need you here.

374
00:41:04,686 --> 00:41:06,095
I am tomorrow.

375
00:41:06,955 --> 00:41:08,855
Great.
- I see you then.

376
00:41:12,594 --> 00:41:16,044
We go to Angelo.
- You like me for a ride?

377
00:41:18,233 --> 00:41:20,187
If we disappear,
he knows that we were.

378
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:24,156
We have the money, let's flights,
Mexico, somewhere, let's disappearance.

379
00:41:24,406 --> 00:41:25,784
We can go nowhere.

380
00:41:26,675 --> 00:41:29,449
Wherever we go,
he will find us.

381
00:41:30,345 --> 00:41:32,121
And if he can find us, he will kill us.

382
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,590
What about those children?

383
00:41:36,385 --> 00:41:38,143
When they saw us now agree?

384
00:41:42,023 --> 00:41:43,405
We must find those children.

385
00:41:47,763 --> 00:41:49,489
Mom, Dad, they're there.

386
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:52,895
Hello men, come inside.

387
00:41:55,504 --> 00:41:57,011
Son, what have you done?

388
00:41:58,473 --> 00:41:59,981
You got house arrest.

389
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:05,110
Is everything okay?
- Yes, I've missed you.

390
00:42:07,782 --> 00:42:09,123
Mom?

391
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,084
Take a few lessons before you
with a twin plane will fly.

392
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:27,413
Mom.

393
00:42:30,338 --> 00:42:32,456
It feels good to be home.

394
00:42:38,914 --> 00:42:40,492
This is not our home.

395
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:46,069
This is just a motel,
until we have a house.

396
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,689
It feels like home.

397
00:42:54,629 --> 00:42:55,953
Really.

398
00:42:59,634 --> 00:43:01,182
Soft dream, boy.

399
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,484
Sleep good.

400
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,171
Do not bite the bedbeestjes.

401
00:43:40,442 --> 00:43:41,801
Hey Lenny.

402
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,809
Have you ever thought,
a child to murder?

403
00:43:52,787 --> 00:43:54,805
But I do it, if necessary.

404
00:44:04,232 --> 00:44:05,655
Hi guys.

405
00:44:08,803 --> 00:44:11,485
Hi Jason, how are you?
- Good.

406
00:44:11,735 --> 00:44:13,062
Nice.

407
00:44:14,776 --> 00:44:17,062
The second day at school
and everybody knows me al

408
00:44:17,312 --> 00:44:20,466
I know. We are in the news
and in all newspapers.

409
00:44:20,716 --> 00:44:22,067
They call us the Flyboys.

410
00:44:22,317 --> 00:44:23,636
Really?
- Yes, seriously.

411
00:44:23,886 --> 00:44:25,704
Some children asked a signature.
- No shit.

412
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,449
No, I mean it.

413
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:30,782
Oh, man.

414
00:44:33,262 --> 00:44:36,312
How do we get from them.
- What should we do?

415
00:44:37,799 --> 00:44:39,347
Run away, no idea.

416
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:49,224
I'm special agent Clinton and this is Agent ...
- Bush.

417
00:44:51,846 --> 00:44:53,170
We are of the FBI.

418
00:44:56,251 --> 00:44:58,398
We wish you happy
a few questions.

419
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,966
Are you with us?

420
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,151
Yes, OK, of course.

421
00:45:14,887 --> 00:45:16,252
Along here.

422
00:45:32,654 --> 00:45:34,667
What a lucky,
that they were long.

423
00:45:41,096 --> 00:45:43,549
I told you that we
in the break had to intervene.

424
00:45:43,799 --> 00:45:45,379
They sit in high school.

425
00:45:46,434 --> 00:45:49,050
Then we have this bag of candy
finds no longer needed.

426
00:45:53,475 --> 00:45:56,528
We need to Angelo.
- What, are you crazy?

427
00:45:56,778 --> 00:45:59,497
He has children.
They can identify us.

428
00:45:59,747 --> 00:46:02,667
We do not even know whether they saw us,
we need to see him.

429
00:46:02,917 --> 00:46:04,456
This is insane.

430
00:46:06,387 --> 00:46:07,773
If we do not go,

431
00:46:08,023 --> 00:46:09,775
He thinks a moment,
that we were.

432
00:46:10,025 --> 00:46:12,210
He said that he wanted people around them,
he could trust.

433
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,924
There was very happy to adopt you.

434
00:46:25,874 --> 00:46:30,274
What do you mean?
- Eat some more candy, but again.

435
00:46:46,928 --> 00:46:48,390
Where do we go?

436
00:46:50,632 --> 00:46:52,672
Quiet guy, we like that.

437
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:59,562
Hey, if you like beer or soda,
there is behind a refrigerator.

438
00:47:07,048 --> 00:47:10,098
I do not believe,
FBl that people driving Cadillacs.

439
00:47:17,225 --> 00:47:18,553
Come boy.

440
00:47:27,002 --> 00:47:30,388
Whose house is it?
- From Mr. Angelo Esposito.

441
00:47:30,638 --> 00:47:32,897
He wants to thank you,
for saving his plane.

442
00:47:35,877 --> 00:47:38,158
Come on guys, but quiet.

443
00:47:42,183 --> 00:47:44,326
Come, it's good.

444
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,268
Hey, the Flyboys.

445
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:11,139
How does it feel to be famous?

446
00:48:27,963 --> 00:48:31,613
The boss wants to see them.
Sal, bring the boys to the dungeon.

447
00:48:33,068 --> 00:48:34,386
The dungeon?

448
00:48:34,636 --> 00:48:39,089
Do not worry,
so we called the cellar. Come on.

449
00:48:55,523 --> 00:48:58,643
You can play,
what you want.

450
00:48:58,893 --> 00:49:05,243
Behind the bar and fridge,
is filled with snacks and fresh.

451
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:10,350
Pretend you're at home.
Mr. Esposito comes in a few minutes.

452
00:49:11,706 --> 00:49:13,166
Okay, thank you

453
00:49:16,878 --> 00:49:19,159
Gaafs something I have never seen.

454
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,769
Weapons.

455
00:49:52,347 --> 00:49:56,397
Difficulties with the boys?
- No, these are good guys.

456
00:49:56,918 --> 00:49:58,236
Well.

457
00:49:58,486 --> 00:50:03,108
If something goes wrong, we should quickly leave.
- If it goes wrong, I shoot first.

458
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:04,927
Give me the keys.
- That little bastards.

459
00:50:06,527 --> 00:50:08,192
Give me the car keys.

460
00:50:09,597 --> 00:50:11,147
Why?
- Now.

461
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,810
Do nothing, before I do something, understand?

462
00:50:21,042 --> 00:50:24,655
Silvio is there,
with that stupid friend of him.

463
00:50:26,548 --> 00:50:29,282
Bring Silvio here
and keep the other busy, okay?

464
00:50:35,056 --> 00:50:36,939
Angelo wants to see you downstairs.

465
00:50:38,059 --> 00:50:41,259
Is that where children are?
- Lenny, are you hungry? 

466
00:50:42,197 --> 00:50:45,047
Sal, give him a sandwich.
- I care for him.

467
00:50:49,304 --> 00:50:51,217
I am sorry for what happened.

468
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,890
Not half as sorry,
as the person who did this will have.

469
00:51:06,187 --> 00:51:07,927
Do you have something done by guys?

470
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:11,432
No, I have not talked with them.

471
00:51:12,961 --> 00:51:14,335
Look.

472
00:51:16,864 --> 00:51:19,964
Thus did we have fun.
The two of us.

473
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,847
That was long ago.

474
00:51:23,571 --> 00:51:25,181
Not so long ago.

475
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,647
I've paid your debts by Hiroshi.

476
00:51:34,849 --> 00:51:36,883
I got paid, you're free.

477
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:42,763
I have not said,
because I wish you would learn something.

478
00:51:44,859 --> 00:51:47,753
We now have more important things,
to keep us busy.

479
00:51:49,197 --> 00:51:51,574
I tell you,
so you can focus on this.

480
00:52:14,288 --> 00:52:15,955
Do you remember when we were kids?

481
00:52:17,858 --> 00:52:21,469
You had a tape recorder
and I could not arrive.

482
00:52:23,164 --> 00:52:26,513
On one evening,
when mom and dad were fighting back.

483
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:38,484
I was so scared and you knew that I just
quiet again would be if you let me listen.

484
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,755
Bad Company.

485
00:52:41,549 --> 00:52:44,207
I know the year, 1974.

486
00:52:45,987 --> 00:52:47,347
Bad Company.

487
00:52:49,057 --> 00:52:51,222
I fell asleep to that music.

488
00:52:51,726 --> 00:52:53,065
I thought.

489
00:52:56,564 --> 00:53:00,764
My brother will always care for me.
- I do too.

490
00:53:13,081 --> 00:53:17,131
I'm glad you're here.

491
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:26,240
Come, go get something to eat.
I'm going to see what these kids know, okay?

492
00:53:49,784 --> 00:53:51,834
I got you.
- Loser.

493
00:53:54,922 --> 00:53:56,266
You is not even close.

494
00:54:01,329 --> 00:54:02,755
You almost had me.

495
00:54:08,236 --> 00:54:10,655
I have touched you.
- No, not true. I've touched you, too.

496
00:54:10,905 --> 00:54:14,025
I saw you hit bone.
- I felt nothing.

497
00:54:14,275 --> 00:54:17,361
This is not?
- This does not count, you can not shoot.

498
00:54:17,611 --> 00:54:20,611
I do not hear called timeout.
- All right, timeout.

499
00:54:24,085 --> 00:54:27,505
Who is that?
- No idea. But we deal with him.

500
00:54:27,755 --> 00:54:30,174
Let your arms fall,
and come out with your hands up.

501
00:54:30,424 --> 00:54:33,711
You get me not live in isolation.
- Okay, I count to three, then we tackle him.

502
00:54:33,961 --> 00:54:35,444
One, two, three.

503
00:54:40,502 --> 00:54:43,002
Search Kyle coverage.
- Cover me.

504
00:54:47,542 --> 00:54:48,890
I got him.

505
00:54:49,977 --> 00:54:53,077
Not true.
- Attacks, now.

506
00:54:53,548 --> 00:54:54,862
Search coverage.

507
00:54:56,283 --> 00:54:57,665
Come on, cover me.

508
00:54:58,386 --> 00:55:00,879
Hey you, you can hear me,
you're there.

509
00:55:01,722 --> 00:55:04,942
He does not easily,
Come on.

510
00:55:05,192 --> 00:55:06,533
Wait.

511
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,850
You're dead.
You're dead, whoever you are.

512
00:55:18,806 --> 00:55:20,764
You should better do your best,
if you want to tackle me.

513
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,418
Do not move.

514
00:55:36,057 --> 00:55:39,107
You have me to deal with.
- Who are you?

515
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:43,544
When you hear the good or the bad?
- That depends on who asks.

516
00:55:43,931 --> 00:55:47,101
Give you about?

517
00:55:49,237 --> 00:55:51,287
Stop.
- You too.

518
00:55:52,707 --> 00:55:54,292
I got you, too.

519
00:55:54,542 --> 00:55:57,792
Grab his weapon.
- I got you.

520
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:04,644
Do you need help boss?

521
00:56:05,486 --> 00:56:07,536
Maybe, stay in the neighborhood.

522
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:12,331
Exactly between his eyes.

523
00:56:14,328 --> 00:56:17,378
He has future.
- A nice shot, huh?

524
00:56:21,268 --> 00:56:22,880
Okay guys, we go up.

525
00:56:23,237 --> 00:56:26,037
Get off me. I'm old.

526
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:30,141
You guys are rough. Nice shot.
- Thank you!

527
00:56:30,778 --> 00:56:32,276
Have you to your sense here?

528
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:34,010
You bet.

529
00:56:34,715 --> 00:56:38,103
You do me to my two boys think.
They are about as old.

530
00:56:38,553 --> 00:56:39,899
Where are they?

531
00:56:41,222 --> 00:56:43,874
They do not live here.
They live in Boston, with their mother.

532
00:56:44,124 --> 00:56:45,607
I see them not as often.

533
00:56:46,994 --> 00:56:50,845
Therefore, you have this room.
- Yes, I made them for him.

534
00:56:51,095 --> 00:56:52,814
But I do not use it often enough.

535
00:56:56,937 --> 00:56:58,331
Anyway ...

536
00:57:00,641 --> 00:57:02,860
I want to thank you,
for saving my plane.

537
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:05,029
Of course.
- No problem.

538
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,993
I've brought you here,
because I want to give you something special.

539
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:11,909
Ask what you want.

540
00:57:16,157 --> 00:57:17,601
Do you think that?

541
00:57:19,794 --> 00:57:22,713
I want you to think about it,
make a good choice, OK?

542
00:57:22,963 --> 00:57:25,274
Whatever you want.

543
00:57:28,035 --> 00:57:29,347
Cool huh.

544
00:57:30,638 --> 00:57:34,681
Can I ask you what,
when you think about it?

545
00:57:35,609 --> 00:57:37,795
Of course.
- Ask.

546
00:57:38,045 --> 00:57:42,430
The police do not know who you guys up there
let alone, so I must pick it yourself.

547
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,827
The men who did this,
have something taken away from me.

548
00:57:45,185 --> 00:57:47,638
Two large bags.
- What was in?

549
00:57:47,888 --> 00:57:50,771
Personal things,
I mean many things.

550
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,850
Have you seen these men?

551
00:58:09,009 --> 00:58:10,398
Boys.

552
00:58:10,911 --> 00:58:12,460
These are Kyle and Jason.

553
00:58:15,149 --> 00:58:17,935
You see him there,
that the food in his mouth packed?

554
00:58:18,185 --> 00:58:20,353
His name is Lenny, the loser.

555
00:58:22,289 --> 00:58:26,739
Believe me, it's true.
The other is my brother.

556
00:58:28,329 --> 00:58:31,379
His name is Silvio.
- Nice.

557
00:58:32,399 --> 00:58:36,199
Similarly.
- Sal, give them some ice.

558
00:58:36,637 --> 00:58:40,659
Which flavor whatsoever.
- Come on guys.

559
00:58:40,909 --> 00:58:42,276
I do so, okay.

560
00:58:43,277 --> 00:58:45,577
What did they say?
- They have not seen anything.

561
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:48,228
They even knew what the bags Saturday.

562
00:58:50,851 --> 00:58:54,939
Bring the boys home, it's getting late,
I do not want to go ask their parents.

563
00:58:55,189 --> 00:58:56,854
I need to call,
I am so down.

564
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:07,451
This will you find tasty.

565
00:59:07,701 --> 00:59:09,459
Snacks and lolly's.

566
00:59:10,204 --> 00:59:12,188
Since I always get energy.

567
00:59:14,141 --> 00:59:15,735
Here, take it.

568
00:59:18,912 --> 00:59:20,353
Have you, you are entertained?

569
00:59:21,881 --> 00:59:26,181
Listen. Let's keep this secret,
as something between us.

570
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:30,003
How about with you guys want?
Have you already thought something?

571
00:59:30,558 --> 00:59:31,865
Not yet.

572
00:59:32,726 --> 00:59:36,170
Think about it there,
if you know something, call me.

573
00:59:37,581 --> 00:59:40,431
Whatever you want.
Whatever.

574
00:59:42,069 --> 00:59:44,422
My brother brings you back home,
make it easy with him,

575
00:59:44,672 --> 00:59:46,100
he is not nearly as tough as we do.

576
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:50,621
See you guys.
- Bye.

577
00:59:53,714 --> 00:59:56,133
Bring the boys home
Lenny and make sure you lose.

578
00:59:56,383 --> 00:59:58,674
Then come back, then we eat,
you and me.

579
01:00:04,191 --> 01:00:06,641
Day.
- See you guys.

580
01:00:10,464 --> 01:00:12,514
They have not recognized us.
- Shut up.

581
01:00:24,011 --> 01:00:25,335
No smoking.

582
01:00:29,517 --> 01:00:32,336
I got my ice.
Where should I leave the cover?

583
01:00:32,586 --> 01:00:34,069
Throw it on the ground.

584
01:00:36,156 --> 01:00:38,315
Silvio Hey, your brother is cool.

585
01:00:38,792 --> 01:00:41,342
I like him.
- Yes, me too.

586
01:00:41,729 --> 01:00:44,079
I wonder,
why someone would steal something from him?

587
01:00:49,069 --> 01:00:50,399
Look.

588
01:00:51,972 --> 01:00:56,422
Beautiful.
- Hey, how are you there?

589
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,686
Angelo has given us.

590
01:01:07,988 --> 01:01:11,538
Do you think that guys who deal with them?
- No idea, kid.

591
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:14,011
What would happen to them,
if he gets them?

592
01:01:14,261 --> 01:01:17,411
No more questions.
Time for a nap.

593
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,892
I wish that you had yours.

594
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:25,170
Those men in the aircraft,
have taken him, I guess.

595
01:01:25,539 --> 01:01:26,853
Give agree.

596
01:01:27,508 --> 01:01:30,858
Hey, Angelo's men
come back to you ...

597
01:02:17,892 --> 01:02:21,792
Can I go to the bathroom?
- You're going nowhere, son.

598
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:25,630
If our something happens,
they know that you were.

599
01:02:30,738 --> 01:02:33,518
You bring us,
in a delicate position.

600
01:02:34,675 --> 01:02:37,428
Put the gun away.
- Why were they in that plane?

601
01:02:37,678 --> 01:02:39,964
Put the gun away.
- It was not them, that's a foul.

602
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:41,856
Put the gun down, now.

603
01:02:42,816 --> 01:02:44,635
You have violated the law
and now you pay.

604
01:02:44,885 --> 01:02:47,638
He is your brother, he will forgive you.
- Shut up.

605
01:02:47,888 --> 01:02:50,165
You continue to sit there,
Lenny step.

606
01:02:51,025 --> 01:02:52,419
Get out of the car, now.
- Why?

607
01:02:58,832 --> 01:03:01,222
If you try to flee,
I shoot you down.

608
01:03:02,035 --> 01:03:03,343
I swear.

609
01:03:06,273 --> 01:03:07,587
What are we doing here?

610
01:03:07,941 --> 01:03:09,727
I told you that you walkie-talkie
had to leave.

611
01:03:09,977 --> 01:03:11,221
That was a bad idea.

612
01:03:12,479 --> 01:03:15,399
What should we do?
- We come here not leaving.

613
01:03:15,649 --> 01:03:17,802
Later someone sees us,
we should work with the children in the desert.

614
01:03:18,052 --> 01:03:20,538
I'm not Lenny murder children.
- Well, I do it, let's go.

615
01:03:20,788 --> 01:03:22,114
You also do not.

616
01:03:22,589 --> 01:03:25,589
What should we do?
Hire someone, to do it?

617
01:03:26,393 --> 01:03:27,942
These guys should disappear.

618
01:03:31,899 --> 01:03:33,275
It is past Lenny.

619
01:03:35,502 --> 01:03:36,999
We need to tell Angelo.

620
01:03:38,839 --> 01:03:40,600
Do you think he forgives us?

621
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:44,208
Do you think he forgives me?
- Shut up.

622
01:03:45,078 --> 01:03:46,413
Stupid idiot.

623
01:03:46,713 --> 01:03:50,130
This was not done, if you walkie-talkie
on the plane had left behind.

624
01:03:51,184 --> 01:03:54,284
You don 't understand, huh?
He has repaid Hiroshi.

625
01:03:54,822 --> 01:03:56,635
Angelo trusted me.

626
01:03:57,157 --> 01:03:59,807
Silvio, listen.
- Shut up.

627
01:04:01,495 --> 01:04:06,195
This is not in your head, huh?
Because you're stupid. You're an idiot.

628
01:04:06,834 --> 01:04:10,383
I have betrayed my own brother,
because of money.

629
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:18,719
You are not me two million decrease
because you suddenly have a conscience.

630
01:04:41,034 --> 01:04:42,408
Run away.

631
01:04:46,774 --> 01:04:48,099
Run away.

632
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:19,900
Run.
- Here along.

633
01:05:20,675 --> 01:05:25,575
Help us, please.

634
01:05:29,516 --> 01:05:30,965
One at a time.

635
01:05:48,369 --> 01:05:49,715
What happens here?

636
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,699
Stop boy,
I just want to talk to you.

637
01:06:02,949 --> 01:06:05,413
I wish you nothing ports,
I just wanted to ask a question.

638
01:07:23,363 --> 01:07:26,088
Kyle,
please answer, you hear me.

639
01:07:31,638 --> 01:07:33,062
He is here kid.

640
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:38,557
And I agree. Listen well,
I say this only once.

641
01:07:40,247 --> 01:07:44,866
You come in 15 minutes,
to the hangar of Angelo.

642
01:07:45,886 --> 01:07:51,236
15 minutes.
And not a second later.

643
01:07:52,025 --> 01:07:53,872
Talk to anyone.

644
01:07:54,695 --> 01:07:56,023
With no one.

645
01:07:57,964 --> 01:07:59,379
Not with the police.

646
01:07:59,933 --> 01:08:01,430
Not with an adult.

647
01:08:02,669 --> 01:08:08,625
If you're not afraid to come,
or if you come with others to you,

648
01:08:08,875 --> 01:08:12,653
I pop a bullet in the head
of your little boyfriend.

649
01:08:14,848 --> 01:08:16,278
Do you understand me?

650
01:08:18,185 --> 01:08:19,711
Do you understand me?

651
01:08:23,991 --> 01:08:25,337
Well.

652
01:08:27,427 --> 01:08:28,766
15 minutes.

653
01:08:30,864 --> 01:08:32,208
Go.

654
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:35,810
Come on.

655
01:09:21,314 --> 01:09:23,844
Silvio, wait I get Angelo.

656
01:09:24,217 --> 01:09:26,647
These vegetables are overcooked,
I blew it.

657
01:09:28,237 --> 01:09:32,087
He says, tell him that I regret.
- Angelo, excuse me.

658
01:09:33,894 --> 01:09:35,242
What happened?

659
01:09:37,964 --> 01:09:39,481
You sound strange, what is it?

660
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:41,784
Say on, what is it?

661
01:09:45,939 --> 01:09:48,487
Lenny and I have done something stupid.

662
01:09:48,909 --> 01:09:52,622
I could not tell, but I wanted to do ...

663
01:09:54,114 --> 01:09:55,772
You stole the money.

664
01:09:57,117 --> 01:09:58,459
He stole the money.

665
01:09:59,419 --> 01:10:01,138
I'm tipsy Ang.

666
01:10:01,388 --> 01:10:03,240
Make the helicopter ready.
- He shot me in my back.

667
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:06,794
Make the helicopter ready.
- You're shot, where? In your back?

668
01:10:07,094 --> 01:10:08,493
I can not breathe.

669
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:12,816
Listen, calm down.
- I can not breathe.

670
01:10:13,066 --> 01:10:14,418
Easy. Where are you?

671
01:10:14,668 --> 01:10:16,087
Ang.
- I'm here.

672
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:19,387
He wants to murder children
and then catch a plane.

673
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:25,062
Ang?
- Yes, I'm here boy.

674
01:10:25,312 --> 01:10:29,412
I can not breathe.
- Yes, that get you. Where are you?

675
01:10:29,816 --> 01:10:32,343
You must say where you are,
so that we can come and collect them.

676
01:10:33,053 --> 01:10:34,518
We will fetch you.

677
01:10:35,288 --> 01:10:38,788
But you must say where you are.
Where are you?

678
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:45,928
Stop it.

679
01:10:47,668 --> 01:10:50,318
Do you remember that song yet?
- Which song?

680
01:10:50,737 --> 01:10:53,187
Thank you,
for me that you've ensured Ang.

681
01:11:35,816 --> 01:11:37,146
Come on.

682
01:12:44,451 --> 01:12:45,793
Come boy.

683
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:51,987
Faster.

684
01:12:54,494 --> 01:12:56,844
What is wrong?
- Are you a pilot?

685
01:13:01,368 --> 01:13:02,698
Sit down.

686
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:10,309
It seems as if your size is not.

687
01:13:11,511 --> 01:13:13,592
Coward who let you die.

688
01:13:15,081 --> 01:13:16,529
He is not a coward.

689
01:13:17,484 --> 01:13:21,484
O no?
Where is he?

690
01:13:26,994 --> 01:13:30,628
What happens here?
- Are you a pilot?

691
01:13:31,028 --> 01:13:33,128
Kyle, is everything okay?
- Are you a pilot?

692
01:13:35,535 --> 01:13:38,885
Good answer.
You fly me here.

693
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:43,365
I fly nowhere,
unless you let the boy go.

694
01:13:44,678 --> 01:13:49,299
And if I die instantly once you shoot?
- Okay, I'll do it.

695
01:13:49,549 --> 01:13:51,077
Can you drive this plane?
- Yes.

696
01:13:51,551 --> 01:13:55,201
Not look at him, look at me.
- Okay, yes, I can drive this plane.

697
01:13:55,488 --> 01:13:57,774
Come on.
We get something from the trunk.

698
01:13:58,024 --> 01:13:59,363
Come boy.

699
01:14:01,928 --> 01:14:03,322
Come on.

700
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,550
Back to the plane.
Give me that.

701
01:14:11,037 --> 01:14:12,354
Faster.

702
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:17,554
Come on, hurry up.

703
01:14:18,712 --> 01:14:21,912
Bring this thing moving.
Sit down.

704
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:29,434
Come on.

705
01:14:32,258 --> 01:14:34,658
Listen, I fly you to where you want to go.

706
01:14:35,762 --> 01:14:37,814
Let the kid go.
- Shut up.

707
01:14:38,064 --> 01:14:42,214
Or I care that he is no longer important.
Flies with this stupid airplane.

708
01:14:58,418 --> 01:15:00,492
The plane is still not refueled.

709
01:15:01,387 --> 01:15:04,487
How far do you want?
- Fly but to the south.

710
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:06,539
I got a destination needed.

711
01:15:07,761 --> 01:15:09,089
Mexico.

712
01:15:47,434 --> 01:15:51,584
Cooper, to tower ...
- No talking, just leave.

713
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:11,395
Sit down boy.

714
01:16:13,026 --> 01:16:14,602
Fly now.

715
01:16:20,767 --> 01:16:22,259
I'm glad you could come.

716
01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:25,446
You dare do.

717
01:16:58,304 --> 01:17:00,624
Listen, we need somewhere refueling.

718
01:17:00,874 --> 01:17:02,966
Take me high enough,
so I can jump.

719
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:22,222
What are you looking at?

720
01:17:24,464 --> 01:17:26,038
Angelo is your murder.

721
01:17:32,205 --> 01:17:36,655
Time to go kid.
- Ed help, he has Kyle.

722
01:18:13,913 --> 01:18:15,507
I make you.

723
01:18:18,151 --> 01:18:19,998
Jason, take on the plane.

724
01:18:49,515 --> 01:18:50,927
Ed, help.

725
01:18:53,586 --> 01:18:56,586
I get 'm not under control.
He zwabbert there.

726
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:06,461
I can not check him Ed.

727
01:19:24,517 --> 01:19:25,950
Kyle watch out.

728
01:19:38,698 --> 01:19:40,178
Jason, come here.

729
01:19:41,234 --> 01:19:42,580
Get the parachute.

730
01:19:47,307 --> 01:19:48,751
I make you.

731
01:19:51,611 --> 01:19:52,957
Hang on.

732
01:19:58,218 --> 01:20:00,699
Jason, I got you, hang in there.

733
01:20:03,656 --> 01:20:05,590
I must put on the parachute.

734
01:20:10,063 --> 01:20:11,862
I must put on the parachute.

735
01:20:36,322 --> 01:20:38,712
Help.

736
01:20:58,658 --> 01:21:01,052
You like to me.

737
01:21:36,983 --> 01:21:38,441
Hang on.

738
01:21:41,321 --> 01:21:42,638
Help.

739
01:21:52,832 --> 01:21:54,149
Keep your right.

740
01:21:58,538 --> 01:22:01,271
I got you, hold on to me.

741
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:10,600
Love so tightly as you can.

742
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:15,238
Let me not go.
- Hold on. Firmly.

743
01:22:15,488 --> 01:22:18,183
I pull the parachute open.
- Hold me.

744
01:22:20,126 --> 01:22:22,822
Here we go.
Watch out.

745
01:22:28,701 --> 01:22:30,934
Okay, hold on.

746
01:22:43,116 --> 01:22:44,639
Is everything okay?

747
01:22:47,453 --> 01:22:51,041
Everything okay?
- I thought that I was going to die ...

748
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:53,991
It is good.
It is our success.

749
01:22:54,894 --> 01:22:56,240
Everything is good.

750
01:23:22,722 --> 01:23:24,097
This is Angelo.

751
01:23:36,102 --> 01:23:39,152
Everything good?
Guys, are you okay?

752
01:23:42,808 --> 01:23:45,483
Unbelievable.
I saw you in the air.

753
01:23:46,512 --> 01:23:48,275
Lenny has Silvio shot.

754
01:23:50,116 --> 01:23:53,216
I know.
- Silvio wanted to save us.

755
01:23:53,753 --> 01:23:55,085
I know.

756
01:23:55,421 --> 01:23:56,735
Where is Lenny?

757
01:23:58,991 --> 01:24:02,541
Fly.
Stupid airplane flight.

758
01:24:23,382 --> 01:24:24,741
Well.

759
01:24:29,222 --> 01:24:31,030
I need to know where my brother is.

760
01:24:33,092 --> 01:24:37,142
Can you cause me to him?
And it now?

761
01:24:39,065 --> 01:24:40,397
Let's go.

762
01:24:55,815 --> 01:24:57,390
Here it is.

763
01:25:02,588 --> 01:25:05,638
Drive through.
Driving by, Vince.

764
01:25:18,004 --> 01:25:21,354
I'm sorry boss.
- Excuse me, too.

765
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:46,080
I will never forget
what you have done today.

766
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:49,298
We're sorry for your plane.

767
01:25:50,069 --> 01:25:51,734
I do not for that plane,

768
01:25:52,705 --> 01:25:54,036
or for the money.

769
01:25:56,609 --> 01:25:58,436
Have you already decided,
what I can do for you?

770
01:26:02,882 --> 01:26:04,256
You know what?

771
01:26:05,417 --> 01:26:06,759
I got something.

772
01:26:08,921 --> 01:26:10,552
I think of something fun.

773
01:26:17,596 --> 01:26:19,074
You did great up there.

774
01:26:20,332 --> 01:26:21,674
You are ...

775
01:26:22,635 --> 01:26:24,143
unbelievable.

776
01:26:25,437 --> 01:26:28,702
I needed a pilot, would you ...

777
01:26:29,341 --> 01:26:30,649
Thank you.

778
01:26:33,512 --> 01:26:34,859
But ...

779
01:26:37,850 --> 01:26:39,174
Of course.

780
01:26:41,954 --> 01:26:43,573
I bring these men just go home.

781
01:26:43,823 --> 01:26:47,323
Yes. Good luck.
- Thank you, you, too.

782
01:27:18,057 --> 01:27:19,546
Is everything good guys?

783
01:27:22,695 --> 01:27:24,276
Not to tell your mom.

784
01:27:48,788 --> 01:27:50,637
I see you guys later, Flyboys.

785
01:27:54,026 --> 01:27:55,340
To look.

786
01:28:17,416 --> 01:28:19,455
I'm sorry, I lied to you.

787
01:28:23,355 --> 01:28:25,555
We do not live in that house,
that I showed you.

788
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:34,398
My Mom and I live in a hotel.

789
01:28:35,167 --> 01:28:36,841
We try to save.

790
01:28:38,504 --> 01:28:41,854
It does not matter to me where you live.
It is all right.

791
01:28:45,811 --> 01:28:47,157
Thank you.

792
01:28:49,348 --> 01:28:51,748
You're the best friend,
that I've ever had.

793
01:28:53,619 --> 01:28:54,943
That goes for me.

794
01:28:59,091 --> 01:29:00,473
I see you tomorrow?

795
01:29:02,561 --> 01:29:05,070
Yes, a new day full of adventure.

796
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,800
We take each other in the channel, OK?
- I will be there.

797
01:29:36,762 --> 01:29:39,982
Hello boy, where have you been?
Have you already seen the newspaper?

798
01:29:40,232 --> 01:29:41,660
You're a hero.

799
01:29:44,871 --> 01:29:48,156
AIRCRAFT READY
BY 12 YEARS Flyboys.

800
01:29:50,909 --> 01:29:55,431
You are dirty. Go out and knock you off,
wash your hands, we eat in five minutes.

801
01:29:55,681 --> 01:29:57,248
Mom ...
- Now.

802
01:30:09,361 --> 01:30:10,689
Grandpa?

803
01:30:20,873 --> 01:30:22,397
What are you doing here?

804
01:30:27,713 --> 01:30:29,111
I get it.

805
01:30:32,484 --> 01:30:35,484
This?
Would you?

806
01:30:57,643 --> 01:31:00,186
This was for bravery.

807
01:31:02,081 --> 01:31:03,677
Thank you Grandpa.

808
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:43,052
How was your day?

809
01:31:44,223 --> 01:31:45,585
Well.

810
01:31:46,258 --> 01:31:49,078
At work we had everybody over,
that was you in the newspaper.

811
01:31:49,328 --> 01:31:51,172
You're quite a celebrity.

812
01:31:53,499 --> 01:31:56,399
And you?
How was your day at school?

813
01:32:13,452 --> 01:32:15,084
You're in my light.

814
01:32:17,189 --> 01:32:18,521
I said ...

815
01:32:22,094 --> 01:32:24,036
What can I do for you gentlemen?

816
01:32:26,799 --> 01:32:28,290
Wait.

817
01:32:28,667 --> 01:32:30,867
Is your attention,
Rick suddenly makes that nice?

818
01:32:31,470 --> 01:32:33,412
Yes, you're right.

819
01:32:33,906 --> 01:32:36,292
They saw us on TV.
- Yes, probably.

820
01:32:36,542 --> 01:32:40,129
Wait, no one talked about a plane,
with an open cockpit.

821
01:32:40,379 --> 01:32:42,479
You can no longer retreat.

822
01:32:43,015 --> 01:32:44,733
Trust me, you'll find the magnificent.

823
01:32:44,983 --> 01:32:48,604
You'll see the sunset at 2400 feet.
- Mom, it will come good, come.

824
01:32:48,854 --> 01:32:51,554
Okay, I trust you.
- It is beautiful.

825
01:33:04,303 --> 01:33:08,353
Hey, you can not park here.
- Are you Ed Thomas?

826
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:13,425
With the compliments of Angelo Exposito.

827
01:33:16,048 --> 01:33:18,384
Sorry, I can not accept.
- Of course it does.

828
01:33:19,084 --> 01:33:20,917
There is nothing in commitment.

829
01:33:23,088 --> 01:33:25,741
Really?
- Really.

830
01:33:25,991 --> 01:33:27,977
There is obviously a prerequisite to adopt.

831
01:33:28,227 --> 01:33:30,804
You have to go fly with the boys,
as often as they want.

832
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:34,917
This is a joke, right?
- Hey, this is no joke, okay.

833
01:33:35,167 --> 01:33:37,867
This is a brand new airplane
and it is all yours.

834
01:33:40,672 --> 01:33:42,247
Is it?

835
01:33:43,909 --> 01:33:46,259
Well. Enjoy it.

836
01:33:57,256 --> 01:33:59,048
A brand new airplane?

837
01:34:01,393 --> 01:34:03,561
Who is Angelo Esposito?

838
01:34:04,696 --> 01:34:06,120
That is a long story.

839
01:34:07,433 --> 01:34:09,079
Let's go fly.

840
01:34:11,803 --> 01:34:14,373
Heaven.
- This is cool.

841
01:34:14,873 --> 01:34:16,462
Put your belts around.

842
01:34:27,853 --> 01:34:29,401
Are you ready?

843
01:34:43,536 --> 01:34:46,036
What are we waiting for?
Let's go.

844
01:34:48,006 --> 01:34:51,606
Okay, then.
Look what this box can.
