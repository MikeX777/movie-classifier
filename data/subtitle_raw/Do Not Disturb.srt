1
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,900
That'll be 8 and 6.

2
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,800
8 and 6 what?

3
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,000
8 shillings and 6 pence, madam.

4
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,600
-Shilling?
-Penny.

5
00:04:21,000 --> 00:08:41,960
Perhaps I could do it.
Just take what I need.

6
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:24,400
No, no. If I'm to live in London
I've got to learn the money.

7
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,500
You're quite right.

8
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,000
-Excuse me, I'm sorry.
-I beg your pardon.

9
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,300
That'll be one of these,
and one of these.

10
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,800
It would be two of these,
wouldn't it?

11
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,800
I beg your pardon but I am in a hurry.
Perhaps I could be of some help.

12
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,900
Look,

13
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,800
the lady is going to live in England,
she's gotta learn the money.

14
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,800
What's the trouble here?

15
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,800
Oh, there's no trouble, officer.
I'm just learning about 8 and 6.

16
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,400
Can I help you, madam?

17
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,600
She's going to live in England,
she's got to learn the money.

18
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,100
That's right.

19
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,200
Gentlemen, do you mind
if I try once alone?

20
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,700
Now, two of these
make 5 shillings.

21
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
No, madam.
The large ones.

22
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,300
Those are florins.
They are only worth 2 shillings.

23
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,800
It's half-pence, pence, trapence, sixpence,
shillings, florins, half crowns.

24
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,700
And we call a shilling a bob,
six pence a tenner, and a pound a nicker.

25
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,300
A nicker?

26
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,700
This is ridiculous.
Why can't we all use the same money?

27
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,100
We had intended to.
But your American Revolution, you know.

28
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,000
Well.

29
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,900
That's far too much.

30
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,100
Believe me, your bearing did.

31
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,400
Fine.
Send them over here to the company flat
and I'll sign them.

32
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,900
Like it? I love it.

33
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,700
I think I'll keep it
and make the company find another
apartment to entertain them.

34
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,400
Is that all, Miss Hackett?

35
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
A cable from the Paris man?
Read that.

36
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,100
Mike, I found it.

37
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,400
It's a beautiful house.

38
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,000
I want him at that meeting.

39
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,800
Now you call this Mr. Simmons
and make that clear __ .

40
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
It's not exactly in the heart of town.
It's in Kent.

41
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,600
But it's only 3 miles out.

42
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,700
This Mr. Pickering is a beaut too.
Was my memo that hard to understand?

43
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,200
I told him to find some designers
so we could see what our wool
looks like on a pretty back.

44
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,700
So it's new for Bert Woolens.

45
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,300
If I'm going to take over this company
I wanna make a few innovations.

46
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

47
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,060
Aren't you excited?

48
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,460
-About what?
-About the house.

49
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,800
-What house?
-The house I found.

50
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,300
And honey, our furniture
will fit perfectly.

51
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,000
Of course, we __ will need
some new things

52
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,800
but I always have a ball
shopping for antiques in England.

53
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,900
Wait a minute, Janet.

54
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,800
Where did you find a house
in this part of London?

55
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,260
You haven't heard a word
of what I said.

56
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,460
It's in Kent.

57
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,700
Darling, you'll adore it.

58
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,000
It's has a big yard
and a beautiful garden.

59
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,300
And a brook.

60
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,100
We have our own brook.

61
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,600
And the real estate man said
that the train service into London
is marvelous.

62
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,700
Where did all this come from?

63
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,600
You were supposed to find
an apartment.

64
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,900
On this block if possible.

65
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,100
I told you this morning at breakfast
that I was looking in the country.

66
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,600
-You told me?
-I told you and you said "good".

67
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,900
You were reading the paper at the time __
but that's what it sounded like to me.

68
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,700
I said "good".

69
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,800
Well, you didn't exactly say it,
you grunted it.

70
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,000
But it was your good grunt.

71
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,600
It's perfect for us.

72
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,800
You'll just fall madly in love
when you see it.

73
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,700
I hope I didn't smash anything.

74
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,400
I'm trying to get the knack of
driving on the right side.

75
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,000
I'd suggest that one,

76
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,100
Mr. Elborn, the red roses go
against the south wall.

77
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,200
They are a bit keen on sun.

78
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,000
And it's left side going,
right side coming.

79
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,500
Are you about ready?
I'm gonna get the 9:23.

80
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,400
I'm ready.

81
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
I've got to drive way downtown.

82
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,600
Good.
Take it all the way to the station.

83
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You're Janet,
I'm Vanessa Courtwright.

84
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,700
Here's a hunting prince
you can hide __

85
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,200
You're Mike.

86
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,500
Put that down there, gaby.

87
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,600
Throw your arms around me,
I'm your landlady.

88
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,900
You've been here a week.
I thought it was time I popped in.

89
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,100
I say you're positively handsome,
I'm gonna like you.

90
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,600
Thank you, Mrs...

91
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,300
From now on you're Janet,
and Mike, I'm Vanessa.

92
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,500
That way you'll be less likely
to complain when the house falls in.

93
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,200
It's a marvelous house.

94
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,400
It's just what we've always wanted.

95
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,200
God knows I never wanted it.
It was in my husband's will.

96
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,100
You are such a pretty thing.
You were meant for Mayfair.

97
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,300
I can't possibly see why you want
to live out here in the woods.

98
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,500
Amen.

99
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,400
We just love it out here.

100
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,700
And I have a million ideas.

101
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,100
Would you excuse us?
Janet, the train station.

102
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,000
Are you ready?
I've been ready for hours.

103
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,000
I won't be long.
I'll be right back.

104
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,800
Mrs. Ordley, will you make some tea
for Mrs. Courtwright?

105
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,500
Don't bother, I'll look around
and have some sherry.

106
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,100
I think it's in
one of these boxes.

107
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,200
Janet, honey.

108
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,500
Go on, madam.

109
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,200
I'll see you later.

110
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,700
The gardener gave me a shortcut.

111
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:12,000
He said we go by way of Twombley
and cut down over a mile.

112
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,500
Sorry.

113
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,000
Pretty soon you'll have more shirts
at the office than you do at home.

114
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,600
I was gonna bring some handkerchiefs
but I couldn't find any.

115
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:38,900
I hide them.

116
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,700
I keep hoping you'll the sniffle
and you'll have to come home.

117
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,000
I'll be home tonight, early.

118
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,600
You wanna bet?

119
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,000
You tell me that
every morning.

120
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,300
And every night
I reheat your dinner.

121
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,100
Honey, I said I'll be home.
That's if I ever get to work.

122
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,600
That must be the Twombley turn
up ahead.

123
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,600
I sure wish the train stops
at Bramble Heath.

124
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,600
I'm sure the station is
right around this next bend.

125
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,000
I hope so.

126
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,200
It has to be.
We're down the last Twombley.

127
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,700
It has been an hour and a half
and we haven't even seen a station.

128
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,700
What's the matter now?

129
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,800
I'm terribly sorry
to have to ask you to stop.

130
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,300
But it's the first cuckoo
of the season.

131
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,000
I wonder if I might ask you
to wait a mo.

132
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,600
I'm very late.

133
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,000
The slightest distraction and...
It's nesting.

134
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,000
Can we look?

135
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,000
I've never seen a baby cuckoo.

136
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,100
Tomorrow I may walk.

137
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,400
Good paved road ahead.

138
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Probably the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

139
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,400
Sir, would you mind backing up
just a little, please?

140
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,000
Darling, if you don't mind
my saying so,

141
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,300
I think we should stop at that house
and ask

142
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,600
Darling, if you don't mind
my saying so,

143
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,000
it won't do us much good,
that's our house!

144
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,900
Would like to take a taxi to the station,
now we had to take a tour of England.

145
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,400
I'm sorry.
It could happen to anybody.

146
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,900
-I'll get the right direction.
-Don't ask that gardener.

147
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,000
It got to be 11,
we were wondering
if something had gone wrong.

148
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,360
You're a lifesaver.

149
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,700
Mike, look.
Somebody's dog.

150
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,000
Honey, my secretary's here.

151
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,000
Don't be scared.

152
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,700
I'll take care of you.
Your heart is just pounding.

153
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,300
I'm going in with her.

154
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,400
What kind of a pup...

155
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,500
You're a fox!

156
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,600
No wonder you were scared.
You're hiding.

157
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,900
I said down!

158
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,800
You should certainly
be ashamed of yourselves.

159
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,900
Madam, may we please
have our fox there? 

160
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,600
No, you may not.

161
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,500
And you ought to be
ashamed of yourselves too.

162
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,700
Chasing a poor defenseless
little thing like this.

163
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,000
It's absolutely inhuman.
That's what it is.

164
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,000
Why don't you go chase yourselves,
see how you like it.

165
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,600
Could we compromise?

166
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,860
Yeah, I'll compromise
with you.

167
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,300
I'll keep the fox
and you get off my property.

168
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,800
It's very difficult for us
providing a fox.

169
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,900
Did you ever see
anything like that?

170
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,700
Frankly, no.

171
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,100
Tell me,
why didn't you get to the station?

172
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,500
Station?
Where is Mike?

173
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,700
He left.

174
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,000
He's been collected
by a very pretty chauffeur.

175
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,500
What?

176
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,500
I don't pretend to know
all the answers.

177
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,900
__ first two weeks anyway.

178
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,300
and I cannot blame the product,
that's damn good wool.

179
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,800
What I am gonna find out
is why nobody in Europe buys us.

180
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,400
The buying season starts with
the Paris fabric fair next month.

181
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,300
We're gonna surprise our mill
and come back with a few contracts.

182
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,300
Congratulations.

183
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,760
If you'll excuse me
I'll get back to work.

184
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,600
Mr. Simmons,

185
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,760
could you and I have a little chat?

186
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,500
Yes.

187
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:10,900
Hello.

188
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,699
Yes.

189
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:25,900
Of course they're merely
 __ to give you and idea.

190
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,700
This McDorfin design is
for town and country.

191
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,300
It shows __ black and brown
 __ tweed.

192
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,200
Another McDorfin.
In purple and black tweed.

193
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,100
Why do we drown
these pretty ladies in wool?

194
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,500
Sir, we sell woolens.

195
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,700
Yes, but couldn't we hint
that there's a beautiful woman

196
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,500
somewhere in the vicinity
of the garment?

197
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,100
Do you mind?

198
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,800
Mrs. Harper.

199
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,200
Hi.

200
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,900
Hi, honey.

201
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,600
I've got so much to tell you.
I spent the whole day with Vanessa.

202
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,700
And we've just been everywhere.

203
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,200
She knows everybody
there is to know.

204
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,200
By the way, we get our phone
first thing in the morning.

205
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,100
Good. you'll be able to call here
more often, dear.

206
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,600
Oh, Mike, Vanessa's been
so helpful.

207
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,800
She even arranged
to establish our credit at the market.

208
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,200
At the Armongers.

209
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,100
Do you know what that is?
It's a hardware store.

210
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,500
That's one of the reasons
why I called you.

211
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,000
To tell me a hardware store
is called Armongers?

212
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,600
No. I want you to bring
a 3-pronged plug.

213
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,700
Where am I gonna find
a 3-pronged plug?

214
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
There must be one
somewhere.

215
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,700
I'll try.

216
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,300
Goodbye, Janet.

217
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Goodbye, darling.

218
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,600
9 pence?

219
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,200
I wish it were 8 and 6.

220
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,700
Wait a minute, operator.

221
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,900
That's three cabbage copper ones.

222
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,100
And one silver one.

223
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,600
Yes, I know, operator.

224
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,100
I know it's the size of an American dime,
but I just don't have one.

225
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
Can you take an American dime?

226
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,300
Tell me why we're so good
at not selling wool.

227
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,360
I'm a salesman,
and quite good.

228
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
I'm sure we don't have
any bad one.

229
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,400
Tell me why all these wonderful
salesmen are all avoiding our contract.

230
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,100
We were for Bert Woolens.

231
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,000
Willy Langsdorf
does not like Bert Woolens.

232
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,400
Willy Langsdorf?

233
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,400
Is he the only customer
on the continent?

234
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,900
He's the only one
that counts.

235
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,900
Ski pants Langsdorf.
Two million pairs a year.

236
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,800
He doesn't buy,
the others wonder,
they don't buy.

237
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,800
they follow him
like little ducks.

238
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,200
That narrows it down.
What does this Langsdorf have against us?

239
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,400
You.

240
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,900
And all the other men
that sat at that desk.

241
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,800
There's something about Bert general managers
that keep shutting us out of doors.

242
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,060
No man...

243
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,760
But a good salesman
should break doors.

244
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,600
Not in Europe.
It's bad taste.

245
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,900
They don't buy and sell in Europe.
They play it buying and selling.

246
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,300
And you must play harder
that anybody else.

247
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,700
You must make the name Bert
something to remember with a smile.

248
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,400
Thank you.

249
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,100
You really know your martinis.

250
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,900
I'm getting back into practice.

251
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,100
This recipe for doing business,
was a secret all these years?

252
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,600
No. But once they put it __
something always goes wrong with it.

253
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,100
Parsons, the man you replaced,
he went to Paris last year,

254
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,300
__ intentions,
and promptly died from a bowl of bouillabaisse.

255
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,900
McGregor before him
brought his wife to the Paris meeting.

256
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,400
Wait a minute.
You're losing me.

257
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,300
Something Langsdorf started.

258
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,600
If you want to be part of his crowd
you do not bring your wife.

259
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,160
If you're afraid of being alone
you can always bring a... friend.

260
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,500
But not your wife.

261
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,700
Make it sound like
an army reunion.

262
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,300
It's fun and games.

263
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,700
Absurd, ridiculous, childish?
Yes.

264
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,900
But it's also ski pants.
Two million a year.

265
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,400
__ even crack __ buy.

266
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,100
Not to be __ disregarded
the care and feeding of the __

267
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,400
In fact there's one in London
right now just for a few hours.

268
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,600
Culkos, a Greek manufacturer.
He should be entertained tonight.

269
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,100
Oh, no, wait a minute.
My wife's planning a quiet dinner tonight.

270
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,900
My first evening home
in four days.

271
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,400
There is an evening
tomorrow night.

272
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,000
That card table looks so silly.

273
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,900
It's the first thing on my list,
a Georgian dining set.

274
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,200
Perfect.

275
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,600
By the way, madam
the lamb's on.

276
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Is it that late?

277
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,300
I better get dressed.

278
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,000
What are you doing
eating my plants again?

279
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,300
You'll never __ a goat, madam.
if you keep feeding him all the time.

280
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,800
I know.

281
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,200
Don't forget the candles.

282
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,000
Giving some sort of a holyday?

283
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,000
I hope so.

284
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,300
Oh, Wellington, what on earth!
Now, you go out.

285
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,300
It was a pleasure,
Miss Hackett.

286
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,200
You made my short stay in London
most enjoyable.

287
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,100
Thank you.

288
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,400
I'm seeing Langsdorf this weekend.
And I must tell him.

289
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,700
A man with Bert Woolens
who can order a wine.

290
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,100
Thank you. Have a nice flight.

291
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,300
I've put all the food away.

292
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,400
__

293
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,400
That's very sweet of you.

294
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,300
I want you to go,
you have your right.

295
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,600
Thank you, doctor.

296
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,400
we were simply fascinated
by your thrilling discussion

297
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,900
of the rock formations
in Central Peru.

298
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:21,800
Next week professor Smithers
will bring us an exciting lecture
on Babylonian writing utensils.

299
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,900
And now music for cogitating
with the Ochney highland bagpipes.

300
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,900
I guess I can just __
last train.

301
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,700
My car knows the way to Kent.

302
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,500
Mine doesn't even know
the way to the station.

303
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,100
Is a secretary of 2-weeks standing
allowed to be proud of her boss?

304
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,500
I'd like to tell __

305
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,700
You're a goat.

306
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,500
Mike, is that you?

307
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,200
It was me,
before I was electrocuted.

308
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,100
Are you hurt?

309
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,100
Half a million volts
never hurt anybody.

310
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,000
That's why I tortured you
to bring a 3-ponged plug.

311
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,800
And you certainly
took your time finding one.

312
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,100
The telegram explained.

313
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,700
What telegram?

314
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,600
I sent you a wire.

315
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,400
Well, where is it?

316
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,000
I haven't the faintest idea.
But I've got a better question.

317
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,400
Is there some reason
we have a goat in the living room?

318
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
His name is Wellington.

319
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,400
His name is Wellington.

320
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,000
That explains why
he was in the living room.

321
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,100
I don't know why
he was in the living-room.

322
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,800
The last time I saw him
he was out in the back
nibbling an empty paint can.

323
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500
I didn't have
very much to do this evening.

324
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,800
So I thought I would
touch up a few things.

325
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,500
Do you have to paint
everything inside?

326
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,500
I didn't paint
everything inside.

327
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,100
I painted the bread box, a __ table
and that chair you're sitting on.

328
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Janet, look at that!

329
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,300
What else you got planned for tonight,
a flood maybe?

330
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,500
You had to pick __
house in the country.

331
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,800
What is wrong
with a house in the country?

332
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,000
Nothing if it's the same country
I live in.

333
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,800
A million apartments in town
and not many of them come with goats.

334
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,900
Does it make any difference
where we live?

335
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,800
I mean, really?

336
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,660
Janet, I'm tired.

337
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,800
You never wanna talk.

338
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,900
I don't feel like arguing.

339
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,900
Why not?

340
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,500
It'll be the first time in 3 years
that we communicated.

341
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,000
Even your telegrams
don't reach me.

342
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,400
I want to have an argument.

343
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,100
You have an argument,
I'll __ the bed.

344
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,600
I guess I'll have to face it.

345
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,200
All I am to you is a wife.

346
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,460
Of course you're my wife,
That was the general idea
when we got married.

347
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,900
It's been 5 years.

348
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,400
Is that a reason to take me
for granted?

349
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,260
You do, you know.

350
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,000
You don't even remember
our anniversary anymore.

351
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,800
It's today?

352
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,800
No, it's not today.

353
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,300
Then why do you bring it up?

354
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,700
Because it's typical,
that's why.

355
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,600
What happens to marriages
after 5 years?

356
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,000
We used to go shopping together,
do things together.

357
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,600
When I bought a new jersey
you admired it.

358
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,400
When I had my hair done
you told me it looked nice.

359
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,300
Okay, so you've got nice hair.

360
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,700
Just because I forget to say a few things
doesn't mean I take you for granted.

361
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,900
All I know is
the way things are with us now

362
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,500
I'd be rather
honeymooning __ alone.

363
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,200
Why not? You'd probably spend
the whole trip
painting the hotel room.

364
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,200
You know something?
You make it sound tempting.

365
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,500
And what does that mean?

366
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,000
Whatever you wanted to mean.

367
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,200
Are you suggesting a divorce?

368
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,160
Three o'clock in the morning
is no time to be telling your husband
you're drifting apart.

369
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,400
I'll get it.

370
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,700
It's another fox
looking for a place to stay.

371
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,700
That's very funny.

372
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,600
And don't do me any favors,
I'll get it.

373
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,900
You would, wouldn't you?

374
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,200
You would let me go down there
all by myself.

375
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,400
All right, we'll both go.

376
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,500
__

377
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,300
Let me tell you __ about life

378
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,700
Mrs. Ordley is sleeping.

379
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,260
Mrs. Ordley __ my words.

380
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,200
What about me?

381
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,760
Have you ever considered the fact
that I'm here in work?

382
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,000
Doesn't that bother you?

383
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,900
That's why we have this house.
So you can relax on weekends.

384
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,400
How do you relax in a warehouse?

385
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,860
While I am home I keep
dreaming of the plumber, the carpenter
the plasters...

386
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,500
We have more help than
 __ hotel.

387
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,400
Maybe __
once in a while.

388
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,800
Telegram for Mrs. Harper.

389
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,600
Thank you.

390
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,500
Well?

391
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,400
It's from you.

392
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,600
It says you won't be home
for dinner tonight.

393
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,300
I am sorry I yelled.

394
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,800
I am sorry too.

395
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,300
You know something?

396
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,400
This house does look
like a warehouse.

397
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,600
Darling, I will try very hard

398
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,600
and maybe next weekend I'll be able to play
country squire.

399
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,300
You're panting.

400
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,200
You put on a little weight.

401
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,700
That's a terrible thing to say.

402
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,100
Put me down.

403
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,600
Who ever heard of a honeymoon alone?

404
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,500
I forgot, honey,
the door is __

405
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,700
The carpenter over here
first thing in the morning

406
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,300
take all the hinges off
 __ down

407
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:28,900
I'll tell Mr. Belari that you were in.
He'll be devastated for not being here.

408
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I've just got to get
that house in order.

409
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,800
Are there any other antique dealers
that we might visit today?

410
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,000
Paul Belari is the only one.

411
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,000
If he doesn't have it here
he'll have it in one his other shops.

412
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,700
I mean, he'll do your house
in half the time.

413
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,200
I hope so because my husband
is very uncomfortable.

414
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,400
Do you know that he stayed in town
two nights this week?

415
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,000
At the company flat.

416
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,600
And I must say
I just don't blame him.

417
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,900
I never used to let my Archie sleep out
except for 3 years during the war.

418
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,400
Then I didn't think it was proper
to make a fuss.

419
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,000
If we have nothing better to do,
we might as well have tea.

420
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,200
Yes, we might as well.

421
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,200
It's too early for martinis.

422
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,800
I've got a marvelous idea.

423
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,400
Why don't you drop in
on Mike?

424
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,600
Mrs. Harper?

425
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm so sorry
to have kept you waiting.

426
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,100
That's all right.

427
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,800
I was just admiring
your lovely fabrics.

428
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,400
Mr. Harper is at the company flat.
I called. You'll be very welcome.

429
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,100
I don't think so.

430
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,000
Thank you, Ms. Hackett.

431
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,100
I'm Ms. Lynch.

432
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,600
What happened to Ms. Hackett?

433
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:54,200
-Ms. Hackett is his assistant now.
-I almost forgot about that.

434
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,200
-Everything all right?
-Excellent.

435
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,710
You are doing a marvellous job.

436
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,800
Thank you.

437
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,300
Excuse me, lady,

438
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,100
would you mind telling me why
we drove around the block one extra time?

439
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,700
I just want to get as close as possible
to 8 and 6.

440
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,700
8 and 6!

441
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,200
It's all I've learned,
8 and 6.

442
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,100
Thanks.

443
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,100
Thanks very much.

444
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,100
-I'm Mrs. Harper.
-I know, I'm Ms. Hackett.
-Oh, hello.

445
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,200
My husband asked me to come up.

446
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,500
__
I didn't think you really wanted to come.

447
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,500
It's a dull gathering.

448
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,900
It doesn't sound dull.

449
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,200
-It's so nice to see you again.
-Thank you.

450
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,900
The last time I saw you
you were holding a fox.

451
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,100
Do forgive me, Mr. Sharod
is looking for the vermuth.

452
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
May I have your coat?

453
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,100
Thank you.

454
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,300
Excuse me.
I've got a surprise visit.

455
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,000
-Darling.
-Hi!

456
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,800
The office said I should come up.

457
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,400
Sure it's okay.

458
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:20,900
-Mr. Harper, I have to leave.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

459
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,500
You go on, sweetie,
I'm fine.

460
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,200
Good afternoon.

461
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,500
Thank you very much.

462
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,600
-What is this?
-Smoked yak.

463
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,100
It is the favorite food of my people.

464
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,500
Mr. Harper knows how to please.

465
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,700
Yes, he does.

466
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,700
Marvelous.

467
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,600
Actually I think the smoked yak
is better than the regular yak.

468
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,299
You like our kind of food.

469
00:34:55,299 --> 00:34:57,200
There is a cafe in soho.

470
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,900
Perhaps this evening
you and I could...

471
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,000
-Honey, you all right?
-I'm doing fine.

472
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
You and Mr. Harper are...

473
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:17,500
Too bad. I was going to suggest another place.
In Kensington.

474
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,300
Very romantic music.

475
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,500
It is the music of the desert...

476
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,500
-Sorry Mr. Harper.
-Don't worry about it.

477
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,700
Claire, honey, will you give me
a handkerchief?

478
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,900
Someone always has to spill a drink.
And poor Mike never has a handkerchief.

479
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,800
I bought him half a dozen.
I knew they'd come in handy.

480
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,700
Don't worry about it.

481
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,500
It's a very simple matter.

482
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,600
Simple?

483
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,400
Of course. Mike isn't the only
unfaithful husband in the world.

484
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,200
I bet there are plenty
running around London now.

485
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,200
They could elect their
own member of parliament.

486
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,000
I don't care about the others.

487
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,300
Naturally.

488
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,700
You have a fine husband, my dear.

489
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,500
I'd go for him myself.

490
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,200
We'll get it back.

491
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,900
Who shall we use for you,
Teddy or __

492
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,300
I don't want a lawyer.

493
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,900
You are not going to hire a lawyer.
We're going to find you a lover.

494
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,100
-A what?
-A lover.

495
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,200
Vanessa!

496
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,200
What would I do with a lover?

497
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,900
Among other things
use him to get your husband back.

498
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,300
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

499
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,200
-Who sent the flowers?
-Vanessa.

500
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,500
What's the big occasion?

501
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,800
If you wanna know the truth

502
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,300
you're supposed to think
they are from a secret admirer
and become very jealous.

503
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,200
I asked her not to do it.

504
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,000
Thanks for telling me.

505
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,400
One of us should be honest
 __ both bored, don't you think?

506
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,860
Janet, I've got the sneaky feeling
you are trying to communicate again.

507
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,100
Do you mind if I have
some coffee first?

508
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,500
Didn't you think I'd find out?

509
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,100
I mean, sometime?

510
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,100
-Find out what?
-About her.

511
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,200
I saw her clothes at the flat.

512
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,300
Whose clothes?

513
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:06,100
Claire Hackett's. That's whose.
A whole closet full!

514
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,200
A whole closet full!
Wait a minute.

515
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,200
You don't mean the six outfits
from the showing.

516
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,500
No, I don't mean...

517
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,600
What showing?

518
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,660
I'm in the wool business.
We have showings.

519
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,900
How suspicious can you get?

520
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,900
That's why you left the party
so suddenly.

521
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,400
When do you find time
to be suspicious?

522
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,100
One fashion show and then
you and your little grumbling buddy
are off and running.

523
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,200
If you'd examined the clothes more carefully
you would have seen the tags on them.

524
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,360
They looked like her size.

525
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,000
How __
Why didn't you ask me?

526
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,260
Oh, no, you had to run
after little Miss Dorothy __ of Mayfair.

527
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,500
They were her style too.

528
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Here's a package for Mrs. Harper.

529
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,600
Here's a package for Mrs. Harper.

530
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,700
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

531
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:01,000
I'll Have a shower, shave, get dressed
and plan my lecturer's pursuits for the day.

532
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,800
And she doesn't have to buy
your handkerchiefs anymore either.

533
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,000
Elisabeth in love, poems.

534
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,600
Yesterday it was perfume,
the day before __

535
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,260
A real lover...

536
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,600
I mean, a real lover,
just wouldn't be this obvious.

537
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,100
You sound as furious.

538
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,400
I could get very angry
if I didn't know that
this was just also stupid.

539
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,900
Have you told Vanessa
that I'm going to Scotland?

540
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,200
She could take a __

541
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,500
She doesn't have to go through all this trouble
because I won't be here to be jealous.

542
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Hello.

543
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,200
Hello.

544
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,800
Hello!

545
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,200
That's a part of your little game?

546
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,900
What game?

547
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,300
Vanessa certainly
wouldn't go that far.

548
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,600
I could have driven you.
I'm getting very good at it now.

549
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,100
Hello.

550
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,700
Hello!

551
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,700
There must be something wrong
with that telephone.

552
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,300
Or one of us has
a very bashful friend.

553
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,500
I'll call you from Scotland.

554
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,800
Have a good flight, sweetie.

555
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,100
And don't eat anything
Remember you get __

556
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,800
Mr. Larson.

557
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,900
Good bye!

558
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,500
I'll take that.

559
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,900
She's getting bolder,
sending cards now, huh?

560
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,800
__ Paul Belari.

561
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,800
Mike!

562
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,400
You forget your bag!

563
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,500
Belari?

564
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,800
Cecil Graves.
May I help you, sir?

565
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,400
-Where's Belari?
-He's at an auction, sir.

566
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,900
You give him a message
from my card writer. 

567
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,800
Tell him to stop pussyfooting around my wife
or he'll be taking up teeth
all over London, okay?

568
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,700
I may not see him
before I leave today.

569
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,600
Would it be all right
if I left him a note?

570
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,400
-What are you doing here?
-You forgot your bag.

571
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,900
I was gonna send someone for it.

572
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,200
You also forgot to read
the other side of the card
that came with the flowers.

573
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,400
What?

574
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,560
I have never met Paul Belari.

575
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,700
He was coming to the house
for the first time.

576
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,300
He couldn't keep his appointment
so he sent flowers.

577
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,200
I miss appointments
and I don't send flowers.

578
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,200
But he is different.
He is continental.

579
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,000
Well, I'm sorry.

580
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,600
Why didn't you tell me before?

581
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,500
I nearly __ with the little man
at Belari shop.

582
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,800
Oh, no. That nice Mr. Graves?

583
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,600
You didn't hurt him.

584
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,700
How can you hit a little man
who wears a wing collar?

585
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,300
The florist I got the __ from.

586
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,100
The florist too?

587
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,000
Let's forget him.
I made a fool of myself, okay.

588
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,600
What do you know?

589
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,900
Vanessa's game worked!

590
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:14,800
You really believed
those gifts were sent to me
from an admirer.

591
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,900
Why would I believe
a thing like that?

592
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,600
Well, you did.

593
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,200
And I think I'm glad.

594
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,000
I'm glad
you think you're glad.

595
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,900
Hello.

596
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,700
Hello.

597
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,000
I'm Paul Belari.

598
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:48,900
-You are Mrs. Harper.
-Oh, yes. I'm Mrs. Harper.

599
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,800
I'm pleased to meet you.

600
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,300
-I thought that you were at an auction.
-I was.

601
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,300
I do wish you would have phoned.

602
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,160
I thought of it.

603
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,500
But after your husband's visit to my shop
I was very ques to see you.

604
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,600
But maybe you wouldn't have
wanted to see me.

605
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:11,800
To die at you husband's hands,
without really knowing why or for whom,

606
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,200
wouldn't be fair.

607
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,600
My husband is awfully sorry
about all that.

608
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,960
He just feels terrible.

609
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,200
I respect a man who fights __

610
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,300
Shall I get to work?

611
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,300
I don't know now
because of the circumstances and all..

612
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,100
The circumstances are past.

613
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,200
We can start with this room.

614
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,700
It seems to need a little help.

615
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,500
Or any room.

616
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,700
Some of the animals in the neighborhood
seem to have adapted to us.

617
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:51,200
This will be very interesting.

618
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,100
Fascinating

619
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,700
Look, it's a Georgian dining room set.

620
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,500
I recognize it from my
decorator's book.

621
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,500
A good copy.

622
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,100
It looks antique.

623
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,800
We could fix it up or...
Strip it and...

624
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,100
Do you want a copy?

625
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,100
All I want is to have
my anniversary dinner

626
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,400
on a table
that doesn't wobble.

627
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,500
With that you eat.
With true Georgian you dine.

628
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,700
We must find you
Georgian __

629
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,100
George, go through this list, will you?

630
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,100
-I'll get __ to the mill.
-Okay.

631
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,200
-Claire.
-Come in.

632
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,100
You got ready __ mill.

633
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,400
That's appropriate for a mill.

634
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,600
Well, we can't work 24 hours a day,
can we?

635
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,500
I thought the nights were cool
in Scotland.

636
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,200
A little higher, please.

637
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,100
This room looks so summery.
I just love it.

638
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,800
You deserve
an extra special lunch.

639
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,800
We'll have lunch in Paris.

640
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,800
In Paris?

641
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,400
-He said "Paris".
-He did, madam.

642
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,300
Charming city, Paris.

643
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,300
Some things I bought recently at the riviera
have arrived to my Paris shop.

644
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,900
There is a Georgian
dining room set.

645
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,200
-True Georgian?
-Of course.

646
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,600
For dining?

647
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,500
You can look at it
if it pleases you.

648
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,560
But I can't go to Paris.

649
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,400
Why not?
Paris is only an hour away.

650
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,300
We could be back by 6 or 7.

651
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,900
But it's another country!

652
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,800
-Isn't it?
-Oh, yes.

653
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,300
Ever since
William the Conqueror.

654
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,500
But you know that
when I go on my first trip to Paris
I have to go with Mike.

655
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,800
It is only a thought.

656
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,600
And I am expecting the plumber.

657
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,700
Good reason.

658
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,200
I mentioned it only
because of your anniversary.

659
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,100
Never mind.

660
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:13,700
For the next anniversary
you will have you dining set.

661
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,900
Mrs Ordley could take the plumber,
couldn't she?

662
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,200
I don't know.

663
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,300
I can't go.

664
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,600
Paris.

665
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,500
Why not!

666
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:36,900
To Paris.

667
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,200
__ if it tickles your nose.

668
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,000
It does tickle my nose.

669
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,100
This is very early in the day.

670
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,000
There are no hours for champagne.

671
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,100
Nor is there a limit.

672
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,300
Thank you.

673
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,100
Well, this is my street.

674
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,700
It's not the most fashionable street
in Paris.

675
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:08,500
Oh, I love it.

676
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,700
It's real.

677
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,200
Here we are.

678
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,600
Open Sesame.

679
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,200
-It didn't open.
-It's locked.

680
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,700
Ali Baba had a key.
He pretended not to, but he had one.

681
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,500
-Where are we going?
-To my concierge, to get the key.

682
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,900
Oh, monsieur Belari,
mais quel surprise.

683
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,400
Maman, j'ai fini.

684
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,400
Allez, dépechez vous.
Allez vite vous habiller.

685
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,400
Oú est Alfred?

686
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,500
Alfred must be the husband.

687
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,800
They are getting dressed
to go visit their grandmother

688
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,100
and Alfred is helping her
from the bistro across the street.

689
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,200
Hello.

690
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,000
Bonjour, ça va?

691
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:38,800
Bonjour, ça va.

692
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:46,000
-Madame Belari?
-Non, ma petite.

693
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,000
Votre fiancée?

694
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,800
Non, elle est Madame Harper.
Elle est américaine.

695
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,000
Américaine?

696
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,800
Oui.

697
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,300
Vous connaisez Rock Hudson?

698
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,200
Cary Grant?

699
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,900
Daniel Boone?

700
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,600
Elle est pas américaine.

701
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,000
Thank you.

702
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:21,700
Merci beacoup.

703
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,700
Est-ce que vous avez la clef?

704
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,800
What a family!

705
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:35,900
He wants to share it with you.

706
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:37,700
Thank you.

707
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,500
That's wine!

708
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,700
Of course, it's wine.

709
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,000
I thought he'd be drinking coke
or something.

710
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,260
No, wine!

711
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,800
It is a mother's best friend.

712
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,100
No, thank you.

713
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,700
To refuse is an insult.

714
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,100
Drink, drink.

715
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,600
Well, a little help
for our relations.

716
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,500
Au revoir!

717
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,200
Au revoir!

718
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,600
I've got to admit
you made them very happy.

719
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,100
They made me happy.

720
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,400
Open.

721
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,200
Look at this bed.

722
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,700
It's an exact copy
of Josephine's bed.

723
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,700
Is it really?

724
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,400
How do I look?

725
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,300
-How do you feel?
-Like Josephine.

726
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,700
I'm so pleased.

727
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,700
Can we take on the plane
with this?

728
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,900
Perhaps we can put it
under the seat.

729
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,300
I don't even care
how much you cost.

730
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,500
It isn't too expensive, is it?

731
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,200
But for you...

732
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:26,800
Madame Harper,
the dinner was superb.

733
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,500
Now let's have lunch.

734
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,300
Oh, thank you.

735
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,200
I like this place.

736
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,000
Madame, enchanté.

737
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,300
What did he say?

738
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,200
You're a very good kicker.

739
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Pick up your glass.

740
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,400
What are you doing?

741
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,500
I want to bring a toast. To you.

742
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,400
Your first trip to Paris.

743
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,800
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

744
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,000
Are you hungry?

745
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,400
I am too.

746
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:10,300
The only word that I know
of that song is "au revoir"

747
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,000
I'm very glad
that's all you know.

748
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:13,900
Why?

749
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,000
It's a men's song.
 __ gay.

750
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,800
Is it really?

751
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,600
Like what?

752
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,000
Come on, it can't be that bad.

753
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,300
__

754
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,400
When papa leaves maman

755
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,200
he just says
"au revoir for a while"

756
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,000
but she knows he'll return

757
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,600
so she waits wild

758
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,900
the home fire is burnt

759
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,100
au revoir is
good bye with a smile.

760
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,200
Is that it?

761
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,360
That's not as gay!

762
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,100
This is my version.

763
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,300
Now give me their version.

764
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
__ of new blueprints.
Would you like to initial them?

765
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,200
__ wrap it up.

766
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:21,000
Tomorrow is my wedding anniversary
and I may just surprise my wife
by remembering it.

767
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,300
Thank you, John.

768
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,700
Hello, Janet.

769
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,600
She's gone off to Paris, sir.

770
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:42,300
She said she'd be here about 6.
 __

771
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,400
I'll leave a message.
Good bye.

772
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,000
All right, thanks.

773
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,500
What's she doing in Paris?

774
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,800
I can think quite a lot of things.

775
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,500
Thanks a lot, George.

776
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:58,500
Don't worry. She may have gone
to buy perfume, clothes...

777
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:00,500
She wants to look nice
for her anniversary.

778
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,500
Are you kidding?

779
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,500
Downtown __

780
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:07,500
There are two things my wife can't take:
downtown anywhere and a second drink.

781
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:10,700
♪ When papa

782
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,800
♪ leaves maman

00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,800
♪ she just says
♪ "au revoir for a while"

I beg your pardon.

787
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,900
Where do they think they're going?

788
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,400
Home.
It's getting foggy out.

789
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,100
Home!

790
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,100
Just in time to get
to the airport.

791
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,000
I'm gonna get a taxi, Paul.

792
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,100
Taxi!

793
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,500
Taxi!

794
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:53,900
Janet, where are you?

795
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,600
I'm looking for a taxi.

796
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:05,800
Janet, you'll get lost.

797
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,500
Don't worry about me, Paul.
I can see perfectly.

798
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:11,300
You see?

799
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,900
You're not Paul.

800
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,500
My name is Alphonse, mademoiselle.

801
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:25,000
-Au revoir.
-Au revoir.

802
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,100
You're beautiful.

803
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,500
This isn't you either.

804
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,500
Keep on talking, I'll find you.

805
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,000
Would you like
to come home with me?

806
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,500
Wellington will love you.
He's a goat.

807
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:02,300
I should have known
you would end up with another pet.

808
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,300
Let's get back to the shop.

809
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,800
Wait a minute.

810
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,100
Au revoir, beautiful.

811
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,600
Give me your hand.

812
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,760
That was fun.

813
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,460
I will call the airport.

814
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,400
Watch the steps.
Four.

815
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:39,500
You wouldn't have found me so quickly
if it hadn't been for that horse.

816
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:00,200
Your trip to Paris
will be longer than you expected.

817
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:01,800
I will call a hotel for you.

818
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,200
Why do I need a hotel?

819
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,700
I spoke to the airport.
It will not be clear till morning.

820
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,200
They don't know
what they're talking.

821
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,600
The Ritz. You'll like that.

822
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,200
We're gonna leave
for the airport right now

823
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,300
and we'll get there
before it clears.

824
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,300
Janet, don't go outside.

825
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:28,500
I know all about fog.
It comes and goes.

826
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:35,900
Paul.

827
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,400
How did it happen?

828
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,200
Don't tell me it's locked.

829
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:04,500
My concierge must have __
while I was calling the airport.

830
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,300
Well, call him and tell him
to pull it up.

831
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:14,200
No, he doesn't have a telephone.

832
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,400
And it can only be opened
from the outside.

833
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,400
Well, that's simple.
Go outside and open it.

834
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,500
What are you laughing about?

835
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:43,400
I've never been locked in my shop
with a woman before.

836
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,900
With no way out.

837
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,100
You're not serious.

838
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:52,700
Yes, I am.

839
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:58,700
Because the shutter on the back door
is even thicker than that.

840
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:07,300
Don't you worry
about a thing.

841
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,400
Where is the telephone?

842
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:15,700
I remember that.

843
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,800
I'm gonna call Mike.
I'll tell him what happened.

844
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,900
He'll be laughing all over __

845
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,300
Hello, Mr. Harper.

846
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,400
I just come __ a warmer coat.

847
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:44,500
Did the missus get our note
all right?

848
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:47,600
No. It was a very nice note.

849
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,200
Is something wrong, sir?

850
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,500
Isn't she home yet?
Where is she?

851
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:53,700
I don't know
and you don't know.

852
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:56,900
She said she wanted
to be back by 6.

853
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,900
That's what she kept telling
the gentleman.

854
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:03,200
What gentleman?

855
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:07,800
Operator, are you sure
you checked out that hotel?

856
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,900
Maybe he's going home.

857
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,800
Will you try my home, please?

858
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,500
What?

859
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,800
You don't know my number.

860
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,500
Good evening.

861
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,000
Mike, what do we owe this visit to?

862
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,300
You know __

863
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,500
How do you do?

864
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:47,200
__ where I can find
your furniture buddy, Belari, in Paris?

865
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,700
Will you have a drink?

866
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:52,100
I don't want a drink.
I want to get to my wife.

867
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,000
You mean Janet is in Paris?

868
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,800
Janet is in Paris with that sex maniac
you dropped in our lap.

869
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,300
Please, Mike,
Paul Belari is a gentleman.

870
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,500
A sophisticated __ gentleman.

871
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,400
Do you think that's a drawback
if you're a sex maniac?

872
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,400
What's his address?

873
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,900
You are jumping to conclusions.

874
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:07,400
All right, Janet is in Paris.

875
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,900
Why do you think she went there?
For a loaf of French bread?

876
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:12,900
If you spent
a little more time with her

877
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:15,100
you'd know that Janet
could never do anything wrong.

878
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,400
That's why I wanna see her.
I wanna spend some time with her.

879
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,300
What's his address?

880
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,800
Excuse me, operator,
will you just keep ringing?

881
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,500
♪ For a while

882
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,700
♪ For a while

883
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,200
Pardon me, op.

884
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,300
Will you just keep ringing?

885
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,200
Just keep on ringing.

886
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,100
It sure is hot.

887
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:21,600
Operator?

888
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,300
One more tingling?

889
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:35,400
What?

890
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,300
All right.

891
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,100
There's nobody home.

892
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,800
Paul! Let me out of here!

893
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,500
Where have you been?

894
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,500
I think I had enough.

895
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,200
Shall you forget where you are?

896
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:26,600
In Paris no one ever has enough
of champagne.

897
01:08:27,499 --> 01:08:29,400
And do you know why?

898
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:36,700
Champagne is a drink of romance

899
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:41,300
and romance is
the soul of Paris.

900
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,600
That's really pretty.

901
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:50,900
To Paris.

902
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,800
To love.

903
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:26,499
It tickles.

904
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:30,300
To the Eiffel Tower.

905
01:09:46,999 --> 01:09:50,560
One week ago
we had not even met

906
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,400
and here we are,

907
01:09:53,499 --> 01:09:57,400
locked away from the rest
of the world.

908
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:02,500
It'll be a night to remember.

909
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,600
I think I'm gonna be sick.

910
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,100
Sick?

911
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,000
No, Janet.

912
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,000
You wanna bet?

913
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,400
We are in Paris!

914
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,200
Janet, you can't.

915
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,300
You're awake.

916
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:07,900
Good morning.

917
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,100
This will make you feel better.

918
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,800
I'll never drink anything
containing bubbles.

919
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,800
Don't be silly.

920
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:30,100
What happened last night?

921
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:38,000
You had too much champagne
and after the champagne...

922
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,800
Never mind, don't tell me.

923
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:59,900
If you just drink this,
it'll make you feel much better.

924
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,600
Nothing to be upset about.

925
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,600
Maybe a hot coffee.

926
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:16,400
Why did you let me...?

927
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:27,900
Mike!

928
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,600
Husband?

929
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,800
I will explain everything.

930
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,200
Happy anniversary.

931
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,200
Mike!

932
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,300
Monsieur Langsdorf, telefon.

933
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,300
Er hat gesagt "es is nichts neues".

934
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:20,600
C'est moi.

935
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,700
My wife from Viena.

936
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,700
She wishes to know
if I have arrived safely.

937
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,100
I'll be right back.

938
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,900
I've got meetings most of the __

939
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:43,200
__

940
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:44,060
Not a call for you.

941
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:45,300
Fine. I'm very positive.

942
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,900
I don't know what this is all about
but I think you ought to speak to her.

943
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:49,800
Listen, I've already wished her
a happy anniversary.

944
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,900
Langsdorf.

945
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:00,300
Mr. ski pants himself.

946
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:03,500
We want to be getting invitations to the party,
we'd sell some wool.

947
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,500
George, we shall be there.

948
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,100
Mr. Langsdorf,
you haven't met Mike Harper.

949
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:11,700
How are you doing?

950
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:13,500
We already know him
from our friend Culkos here.

951
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,600
He doesn't look like
 __ full of bouillabaisse would kill him.

952
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:18,900
I can hold the bouillabaisse.

953
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:21,700
And just for desert
a little Sachertorte might be nice.

954
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,500
You know about our great Viennese desert.

955
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I'm very big with deserts.

956
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,900
Alicia Petrova.

957
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:32,700
Something even better
than Sachertorte.

958
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,100
You must come to our party
this evening.

959
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:40,300
Thank you, I'll be there.

960
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:42,800
Perhaps I can help you
with a companion for the evening.

961
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,700
I don't really think
that'll be necessary.

962
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:47,600
If you'll excuse me,
I have a meeting.

963
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:50,100
He doesn't need a companion.

964
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,600
He must have his own
delicious little pastry.

965
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:54,000
I met her in London.

966
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,100
For a personal assistant
she is a pastry.

967
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:57,300
Huh, Simmons?

968
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,000
That she is. Excuse me.

969
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,660
We shall see it tonight.
 __

970
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:05,500
You are right that he is different
for one of the Bert people.

971
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:10,800
London, Please.

972
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:14,000
I'd like to speak to Ms. Claire Hackett.

973
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:16,800
That's Mayfair, 3925.

974
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,300
Mr. Mike Harper's room?

975
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,700
I'll see you tonight. Bye.

976
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,900
I'm sorry, madam.
We do not give room numbers.

977
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,900
But you don't understand,
I'm...

978
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:34,600
-Mr. Simmons.
-Mrs. Harper.

979
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,200
So nice to see you.

980
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,700
Is Mike in his room?
I've got to talk to him.

981
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,000
Come with me.

982
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,800
We got a terrible misunderstanding.

983
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,200
Where are you taking me?

984
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:48,460
Mrs. Harper, I don't like
to __ people's personal lives.

985
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:51,300
But it would be best
if you returned to Kent.

986
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:55,200
Kent! I don't wanna go to Kent.
I'm going to talk to Mike.

987
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:56,800
He's not in the talking mood.

988
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,600
Then he'll just have to listen.

989
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,200
I'm gonna sit right here
and wait for him.

990
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,600
We can't have that.

991
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:10,900
You have met Ingrid.
She is the foreman of our Gothenburg plant.

992
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:13,500
And your friend?

993
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,300
This is she.

994
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,100
Excuse us, please,
we are very late.

995
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,600
Mr. Simmons, I don't know
what all this is about.

996
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,500
And what did you mean by
"this is she"?

997
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:29,000
It's difficult to explain.

998
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,800
I couldn't introduce you
because you are a... wife.

999
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,000
Of course I'm a wife.

1000
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:35,800
It's a rather ridiculous thing

1001
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,500
but men don't bring their wives
here to this free days.

1002
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:40,500
What kind of nonsense is this?

1003
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:42,700
It is nonsense.
It's also a fact.

1004
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,600
I don't believe it.

1005
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:48,800
They're all...

1006
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,600
The plant foreman?

1007
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:01,300
Yo no sabía cual vestido comprar.
Entonces compré todos.

1008
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,900
-She?
-She is.

1009
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:21,300
No, I don't think so.
That is not likely.

1010
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:26,400
I don't know when you find time
to hold meetings.

1011
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,800
Sometimes it is rather difficult
to get a quorum.

1012
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:36,300
I have not met this jewel.

1013
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:38,000
How would I forget her?

1014
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:41,900
Mr. Langsdorf, this is...
Well, you met Mike Harper...

1015
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:44,400
Oh, yes, the personal assistant.

1016
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,300
You must come to my party tonight.

1017
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:50,900
Don't disappoint me.

1018
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:52,700
That was close.

1019
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:59,200
Claire Hackett is in London.
Take the first plane back and see.

1020
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,500
I just can't go home.

1021
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:05,500
At least not until I talk to Mike
and I explain him what happened last night.

1022
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:08,200
You don't know,
he's just furious with me.

1023
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,300
Maybe the __ clerk will know
where he is.

1024
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:13,700
He's not here.
He won't be back until the party.

1025
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:16,600
Then I'll go to the party.

1026
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:19,100
That's impossible.

1027
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:23,000
It would absolutely ruin Mike
if they found out he was here with his wife.

1028
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,800
Then they won't find out.

1029
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:32,500
What?

1030
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:34,400
Mr Simmons, leave everything to me.

1031
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:35,500
__

1032
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,600
-__ where is she?
-I haven't the slightest idea.

1033
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:09,700
Wait a minute.

1034
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:12,200
I didn't answer her calls this morning
but now I'm getting really worried.

1035
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,500
I thought I __ you on the chin.
Where did you get the shiner?

1036
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,500
After you cl __
me on the chin,

1037
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:23,200
Janet insisted that
I ran after you and explain.

1038
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,800
I refused and she...

1039
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:32,700
Janet?

1040
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,800
-You're kidding.
-No, I'm not kidding.

1041
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:43,660
It's pretty funny.

1042
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,300
You're right,
it is pretty funny.

1043
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:49,400
What I've been through
only because your wife

1044
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:52,100
wanted a dinning room set
for your wedding anniversary.

1045
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:55,500
That's why she came here!

1046
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,760
That's why she came here.

1047
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,700
And she's probably on her way home.
Right now.

1048
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,500
Wedding anniversary.

1049
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,500
Come on.
Let's have lunch.

1050
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:11,100
And I'll tell you all about
our glamorous night in Paris.

1051
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,500
Ich und du
Müllers Kuh

1052
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,900
Müllers Esel
der bist du

1053
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Pardon me,
is Mr. Harper __ yet?

1054
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:13,500
I am sorry, mademoiselle,
His key is still here.

1055
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:14,800
Thank you.

1056
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,800
Which one is yours?

1057
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:47,400
I beg your pardon?

1058
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:51,300
Who is your man?

1059
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,400
Mike Harper.

1060
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,100
Nice.

1061
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:07,900
Don't be surprised
if I steal him from you.

1062
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:25,200
Room 207, please.

1063
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:33,200
Operator, Simmons here.
Do you have a call for me?

1064
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,600
Look, I'll call you back.
Thank you.

1065
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:46,660
In the name of
Bert Woolens

1066
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:49,200
I forbid you to go
to that party.

1067
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:52,200
I am not leaving until
I've seen my husband.

1068
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:55,100
Mr. Simmons, this is much more
difficult for me...

1069
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,300
So good to see you.

1070
01:25:58,340 --> 01:26:00,700
I'm looking forward to
our meeting tomorrow.

1071
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:05,100
I've seen some of your fabrics and
I'm really anxious to talk to you about them.

1072
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:06,000
So am I.

1073
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:07,200
This is monsieur Renard.

1074
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:08,600
This is Claire Hackett.

1075
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,400
How do you do?

1076
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:15,900
Excuse me.

1077
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:26,100
May I have your coat?

1078
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:23,000
I am overjoyed
that you came to my party, Ms. Hackett.

1079
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,500
Thank you.

1080
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,500
That's what I call an assistant.

1081
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,500
Mr. Langsdorf.

1082
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:33,800
You are quite a salesboy
for Bert Woolens.

1083
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:35,100
I think I'll switch to you. 

1084
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,700
That's wonderful!

1085
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,000
I don't know how to thank you.

1086
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:43,900
I do. Come to Vienna.
Be my assistant.

1087
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:48,700
That's very nice
but I can't leave Mike.

1088
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:02,800
I haven't met this lovely creature!

1089
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,500
You had too much champagne tonight.

1090
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:06,300
You met her in London,
Claire Hackett!

1091
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:11,400
This Claire Hackett is not the personal assistant
that I met with Harper in London.

1092
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:15,900
I know Harper. He probably calls
all his personal assistants
Claire Hackett.

1093
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,300
It is very strange.

1094
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:28,300
-May I?
-Two minutes.

1095
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:27,400
-Mr. Langsdorf...
-Please, call me Willy.

1096
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:31,800
Willy, I'm exhausted
and if you don't mind
I'd like to go to the powder room.

1097
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:32,700
Of course.

1098
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:36,400
After this is over
I'm giving a party in my own suite.

1099
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:39,300
Just for very few people.

1100
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:41,800
I don't know.

1101
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:44,400
I won't let you go
until you say yes.

1102
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:45,500
Yes.

1103
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:56,600
Mike!

1104
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:00,500
-Where have you been?
-What are you doing dressed like that?

1105
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:03,500
__ with Paul, he told me everything.

1106
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:06,900
-Just don't wait to hear my side of the story...
-Everything.

1107
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:14,300
You don't know
what I've been through.

1108
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:15,400
Yes, I do.

1109
01:31:16,100 --> 01:31:19,700
Tell me something.
It was a left hook or a right crossed.

1110
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:22,700
A right crossed.

1111
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:23,800
That's what I figured.

1112
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:27,200
You know Belari's left eye
is glorious black and purple?

1113
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:30,500
Well, the swelling
came down.

1114
01:31:30,540 --> 01:31:32,900
But the price of the dining room set
went up.

1115
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,400
You bought it?

1116
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,800
-Don't you love it?
-I love you.

1117
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:41,200
I don't care what Langsdorf thinks
about wives.

1118
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:44,900
Honey, Langsdorf doesn't think
that I'm your wife.

1119
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:47,300
He thinks I'm your... you know.

1120
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:48,400
No, I don't know.

1121
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:51,600
They all think that
I'm your personal assistant,
Claire Hackett.

1122
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:53,500
-Cut it now.
-They do.

1123
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,900
Why would they think
a thing like that?

1124
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,300
I don't know.

1125
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:05,200
You mean you think Claire Hackett is here?
Honey, Claire Hackett is in London.

1126
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:15,600
Would I lie to a woman
with a punch like yours?

1127
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:20,800
Don't you think we better
get back to the party?

1128
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:23,900
Don't you think we better
go up to the room
for a little glass of champagne?

1129
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:24,800
Yes, I do.

1130
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:27,800
But you should make an appearance.
Remember the ski pants.

1131
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,600
Just for a minute.

1132
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:43,400
-What is that?
-Just getting back into character.

1133
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:46,200
Come back here.

1134
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:33,200
-Mike, darling
-What is it, sweetheart?

1135
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:37,000
Do you know what you can get me
for our anniversary?

1136
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:44,400
-A divorce.
-Anything you like, darling.

1137
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:02,900
The airport limousine
will be here in 15 minutes.

1138
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:06,200
If you will be seated
I will call you when it arrives.

1139
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,100
Your job will be
no more than a personal assistant.

1140
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,800
My experience is Mike Harper
 __ dull job.

1141
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:24,100
You won't find it so dull
with Claude Renard.

1142
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:28,200
It's about time I found someone
who really appreciates me.

1143
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:31,000
You mean Harper never really
appreciated you?

1144
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:35,100
There are only two things he appreciates:
his business and his wife.

1145
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:36,400
Come, my dear.

1146
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,500
I know a wonderful discotheque
that is open all night.

1147
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:47,900
Ms. Hackett.

1148
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:54,800
Excuse me.

1149
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:56,800
We know each other.

1150
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:00,800
By the way, Claire,
if you see Mr. Harper

1151
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:02,500
will you tell him I just resigned?

1152
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:06,400
What's his room number?

1153
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,100
He is in room 203.

1154
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:13,500
-Bonjour.
-Bonjour.

1155
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,000
I want her found.

1156
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:30,100
I don't care, check all the airline.
And you call me back on room 207.

1157
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:36,600
Thanks.

1158
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:39,100
Mr. Langsdorf, let go of me.
It's not what it looks like.

1159
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:42,900
Mrs. Hackett, __

1160
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,000
Wunderbar!

1161
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,200
Help, police!

1162
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:03,300
Help!

1163
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,400
__ , sir.

1164
01:39:10,300 --> 01:39:12,000
Help, police!

1165
01:39:31,900 --> 01:39:33,500
Don't run so fast!

1166
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:23,700
Hilf mir!
Meine Frau!

1167
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:25,100
-Your what?
-My wife!

1168
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:04,100
Meine Frau!

1169
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,600
Help me!

1170
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:16,500
Janet!

1171
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:18,200
It's me!
