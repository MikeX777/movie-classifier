1
00:04:08,661 --> 00:04:10,993
We are currently on a family trip

2
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,031
If you need to reach us,
please call tomorrow

3
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,963
Be happy!

4
00:07:41,974 --> 00:07:43,464
Open the door

5
00:07:43,976 --> 00:07:46,035
you have the keys!

6
00:08:06,565 --> 00:08:10,296
You wanted to go on a trip so badly.
What's wrong now?

7
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:12,968
You call that a trip?
It was hell

8
00:08:17,109 --> 00:08:18,804
Get rid of that right now!

9
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,085
Shoot me. Shoot me.
Please make my day

10
00:09:58,177 --> 00:10:00,372
Why aren't you picking up?

11
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:02,241
Are you still angry at me?

12
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:06,413
I'm sorry.
Hurry and pick up

13
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:11,254
I've done everything for you!
What are you unsatisfied with?

14
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:12,981
You are driving me nuts!

15
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:15,687
Pick up the phone!

16
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:17,592
Damn it!

17
00:14:57,242 --> 00:14:58,903
Pick up the phone now!

18
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,340
You want to see me
go crazy again?

19
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,240
I want to talk, so pick up!

20
00:15:09,821 --> 00:15:11,914
If you don't answer the phone,
I will go home right now

21
00:18:55,614 --> 00:18:58,708
What are you doing
with all the doors open?

22
00:18:59,317 --> 00:19:02,377
And can't you answer the phone?

23
00:19:02,754 --> 00:19:04,949
I couldn't get any work done
on my business trip!

24
00:19:05,724 --> 00:19:08,625
Why are you ignoring me?
Do I look that foolish to you?

25
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,550
Am I your slave?

26
00:19:13,331 --> 00:19:14,855
What do I need to do?

27
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,900
Think it's easy to live this well?

28
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:19,870
I told you not to wear this!

29
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:22,637
Why do you keep doing
the things I hate?

30
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:32,447
I'm sorry

31
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:34,651
I'm sorry

32
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:38,087
I don't know why I act this way

33
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,384
I love you

34
00:19:43,495 --> 00:19:45,395
Please make me happy

35
00:19:52,637 --> 00:19:55,572
Why? Why do you make
me feel so wretched?

36
00:19:55,907 --> 00:19:57,841
For once let me do as I want to!

37
00:19:58,677 --> 00:20:01,874
Think I'll devour you?
Am I some insect?

38
00:20:02,013 --> 00:20:06,143
Just please hold still. Please.

39
00:20:28,273 --> 00:20:29,831
What the hell?

40
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:31,670
Who's playing golf in my yard?

41
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:40,944
How'd you get in here?

42
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:46,982
Hello? Is this the police?

43
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:49,493
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

44
00:20:57,102 --> 00:20:59,832
Hello? My house is...

45
00:24:44,329 --> 00:24:46,263
Hi, this is Oak Jin-Gon

46
00:24:46,597 --> 00:24:48,724
I'm abroad right now
for a photo shoot

47
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,859
If you need to reach me,
please call 011-342-3464

48
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:54,462
Thanks

49
00:31:45,116 --> 00:31:48,984
Hi, you've reached the home
of Ji-Eun and Hyun-Soo

50
00:31:49,086 --> 00:31:52,886
We're in Hawaii now
for our three year anniversary

51
00:31:53,691 --> 00:31:57,821
If you have something to say,
please leave a message after the beep

52
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:45,047
What the hell's this?

53
00:36:01,472 --> 00:36:02,962
See if they've taken anything

54
00:36:17,154 --> 00:36:19,054
Honey! Honey!

55
00:36:19,156 --> 00:36:20,885
Who the hell are you?

56
00:36:20,991 --> 00:36:23,459
What are you drunk idiots
doing in my home?

57
00:36:24,028 --> 00:36:26,189
And why are you two
wearing our pajamas?

58
00:36:26,797 --> 00:36:28,230
- Anything stolen?
- No

59
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:31,026
If you're not thieves,
then what are you?

60
00:38:21,545 --> 00:38:23,376
Mi-Young, open your eyes!

61
00:38:24,414 --> 00:38:25,676
Mi-Young!

62
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:28,013
Mi-Young, wake up!

63
00:38:28,385 --> 00:38:29,579
Mi-Young!

64
00:38:30,354 --> 00:38:32,015
Mi-Young, are you alright?

65
00:38:32,723 --> 00:38:34,020
Mi-Young!

66
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:37,056
Mi-Young, wake up!

67
00:38:37,161 --> 00:38:39,857
Wake up! Mi-Young!

68
00:38:40,998 --> 00:38:43,125
Mi-Young! Mi-Young!

69
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:46,269
Mi-Young, wake up!

70
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,136
Please open your eyes!

71
00:44:45,966 --> 00:44:48,332
We are off to Jeju island!

72
00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:51,231
If you need to contact us
please call back in three days!

73
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:52,703
Be happy!

74
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,874
Dad, did you call?

75
00:46:08,549 --> 00:46:09,982
Are you okay, dad?

76
00:46:10,818 --> 00:46:12,080
Hello?

77
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:13,308
Hello...

78
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:03,802
Dad!

79
00:47:06,674 --> 00:47:07,698
Father!

80
00:47:13,347 --> 00:47:14,575
Who are you people?

81
00:47:15,115 --> 00:47:17,015
What are you doing
in my father's home?

82
00:47:17,284 --> 00:47:19,081
Where's father?

83
00:47:21,555 --> 00:47:23,489
- Father!
- Father!

84
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:26,316
- He's not here
- What?

85
00:47:27,027 --> 00:47:29,086
You two.
Stay where you are

86
00:47:29,496 --> 00:47:30,758
Come outside

87
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,329
Hello? This is the police, right?

88
00:47:38,539 --> 00:47:41,702
Yes, I have a situation here.
Please come quickly

89
00:47:53,153 --> 00:47:54,381
What did you do to the old man?

90
00:47:55,689 --> 00:47:57,122
Sweetheart, you tell me

91
00:47:57,658 --> 00:47:58,852
You killed him, right?

92
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,088
What's this?

93
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:10,763
I see you've broken into
many other homes

94
00:48:11,272 --> 00:48:13,740
So you took pictures
as if it was your own home

95
00:48:16,677 --> 00:48:19,271
Officer Lee, see if their owners
reported a burglary

96
00:48:19,346 --> 00:48:20,677
Yes, sir

97
00:48:21,749 --> 00:48:24,775
You two. What did you steal
from all these homes?

98
00:48:28,956 --> 00:48:30,856
This punk needs to learn a lesson

99
00:48:33,193 --> 00:48:34,490
Take the woman outside

100
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:34,215
Sorry to keep you waiting

101
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:37,454
He buried him secretly
near his apartment

102
00:49:37,925 --> 00:49:39,187
What?

103
00:49:39,426 --> 00:49:40,791
- Officer Lee!
- Yes, sir!

104
00:49:41,495 --> 00:49:43,929
Take the CIS team
to his father's apartment

105
00:49:56,377 --> 00:49:58,038
Open the lid

106
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,346
Father...

107
00:50:09,623 --> 00:50:10,851
Father!

108
00:50:11,525 --> 00:50:13,550
Doesn't look like
he was buried in secret

109
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:14,922
Father

110
00:50:18,832 --> 00:50:24,361
Missing person report

111
00:50:27,174 --> 00:50:28,505
This is you, isn't it?

112
00:50:50,431 --> 00:50:51,659
Yes?

113
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:54,357
Yes, I understand

114
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:02,841
Illegal entry. Murder

115
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:06,201
Abandoning a dead body.
Kidnapping

116
00:51:08,248 --> 00:51:10,716
If you have any others,
tell me now

117
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,116
What did you do to that woman?

118
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,614
What did you do to her
to keep her so silent?

119
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:22,451
Sir, he's clean

120
00:51:24,264 --> 00:51:27,665
Also, I called some of the houses
he shot with the camera,

121
00:51:28,635 --> 00:51:30,364
and they said nothing was stolen

122
00:51:31,138 --> 00:51:32,264
Really?

123
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:35,665
- Bring her husband when he comes
- Yes, sir

124
00:51:44,751 --> 00:51:47,549
You even have a college degree.
So why'd you break into their homes?

125
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,147
Sir, he's here

126
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,285
Tell him to come in

127
00:51:58,732 --> 00:52:00,597
Lee Min-Kyu, right?

128
00:52:00,968 --> 00:52:02,094
Yes

129
00:52:03,637 --> 00:52:04,899
She's all yours

130
00:52:15,682 --> 00:52:17,172
Son of a bitch!

131
00:52:20,187 --> 00:52:21,245
Stop it!

132
00:52:21,355 --> 00:52:23,823
Let go!
I'm gonna kill that bastard!

133
00:52:25,025 --> 00:52:26,356
Let's go

134
00:52:30,864 --> 00:52:32,024
Sir!

135
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,462
The autopsy results
have come out

136
00:52:35,936 --> 00:52:38,063
it's not murder, it's lung cancer

137
00:52:38,839 --> 00:52:41,000
What? Lung cancer?

138
00:52:41,508 --> 00:52:44,272
- Are they sure?
- Yes, I understand

139
00:52:44,611 --> 00:52:49,048
He was delicately shrouded.
Apart from a real ceremony,

140
00:52:49,449 --> 00:52:52,111
He buried his body
better than any son could

141
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,823
He doesn't seem
like a bad person to me

142
00:52:59,459 --> 00:53:01,757
- Wait outside
- Yes, sir

143
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:16,466
Well, you're free from
the homicide charge

144
00:53:17,511 --> 00:53:18,978
So how was she?

145
00:53:19,646 --> 00:53:21,238
You liked forcing her, right?

146
00:53:24,418 --> 00:53:25,646
What are you looking at?

147
00:53:30,257 --> 00:53:31,554
Don't smile

148
00:53:50,077 --> 00:53:52,238
Your favorite plant over there...

149
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:55,571
I knew you'd come back
so I took good care of it

150
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:58,418
It looks healthy, doesn't it?

151
00:54:01,421 --> 00:54:04,254
I've thought things out
and I'd been too much

152
00:54:06,259 --> 00:54:08,124
I'll be good from now on

153
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:15,992
Okay, I won't if
you don't want me to

154
00:54:17,638 --> 00:54:19,970
I've changed, you see?

155
00:54:21,274 --> 00:54:25,938
Oh yeah, while you were gone,
I sent plenty of money to your folks

156
00:54:59,479 --> 00:55:03,609
If it's that hard to withstand,
then do what you like

157
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,867
Isn't he being too harsh?

158
00:56:40,781 --> 00:56:42,305
Smile again

159
00:56:49,222 --> 00:56:50,814
Let go, you bastard!

160
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,126
Son of a bitch!

161
00:57:46,513 --> 00:57:47,810
Sit down!

162
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:53,982
Sit down!

163
00:59:24,611 --> 00:59:26,272
Prisoner 2904!

164
00:59:32,118 --> 00:59:36,077
Playing games with me, you punk?
You scared me!

165
00:59:36,189 --> 00:59:37,918
Try that again

166
00:59:38,091 --> 00:59:39,683
Today, you go hungry

167
01:00:22,002 --> 01:00:23,936
Don't pretend you're sleeping

168
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:29,573
I've been thinking about us,
and I feel like a real dumb ass

169
01:00:29,743 --> 01:00:31,711
Was I that bad to you?

170
01:00:32,512 --> 01:00:34,139
Tell me!

171
01:00:37,417 --> 01:00:40,750
I never wanted to ask this,
but I have to

172
01:00:41,321 --> 01:00:43,346
What did he do to you?

173
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:47,223
Did he do this?

174
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:50,495
He did this, but you stayed still?

175
01:00:50,663 --> 01:00:52,324
Like this?

176
01:00:53,266 --> 01:00:55,564
Like this? Like this?

177
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,649
Prisoner 2904!

178
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,151
Prisoner 2904!

179
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:36,270
You son of a bitch!

180
01:01:39,212 --> 01:01:41,510
Why do you keep hiding?

181
01:01:41,681 --> 01:01:43,911
Wanna disappear
from the world altogether?

182
01:01:45,351 --> 01:01:48,582
If you pull that again,
I'll kill you

183
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:12,998
Can I help you?

184
01:04:16,002 --> 01:04:17,799
Excuse me!

185
01:04:57,777 --> 01:05:00,541
- You're cleaning it again?
- Hi, honey

186
01:05:03,916 --> 01:05:05,850
Who is she?

187
01:05:07,353 --> 01:05:09,082
I don't know

188
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,790
Let her sleep

189
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,838
Where have you been?

190
01:06:00,006 --> 01:06:02,201
I told you to call me
if you go out!

191
01:06:03,176 --> 01:06:05,110
Where have you been?

192
01:07:24,891 --> 01:07:27,086
You're behind me, aren't you?

193
01:07:28,027 --> 01:07:30,621
The human eye sees
within the 180 degree angle

194
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:34,091
so you're hiding
in the other 180 degrees?

195
01:07:34,767 --> 01:07:36,826
But that's impossible!

196
01:07:38,371 --> 01:07:40,737
You bastard!

197
01:07:45,011 --> 01:07:48,674
You need more practice.
And take care of the shadow

198
01:07:48,781 --> 01:07:52,046
and you'll have to calculate
the human mind, idiot!

199
01:07:52,285 --> 01:07:54,253
You crazy bastard.

200
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:58,351
Even if you cover all that
what are you gonna do?

201
01:09:05,925 --> 01:09:09,292
Let's move out of here.
First thing tomorrow

202
01:09:10,596 --> 01:09:13,759
You're waiting for him
to finish his sentence, aren't you?

203
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,398
I'm right, aren't i?

204
01:09:22,775 --> 01:09:25,505
A moving service please.
Hello?

205
01:09:25,978 --> 01:09:27,468
What's with you?

206
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:34,109
Fine, then

207
01:09:34,754 --> 01:09:36,847
let's wait together for him

208
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:39,885
I dare you to come,
you son of a bitch

209
01:09:41,394 --> 01:09:43,919
Prisoner 2904! Your meal!

210
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,961
Prisoner 2904!

211
01:09:49,468 --> 01:09:53,131
When I go in this time,
I'll kill you for sure!

212
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:05,850
You're behind me, aren't you?

213
01:10:06,385 --> 01:10:08,751
Trying to escape?

214
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,996
Bastard...

215
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:26,502
You think you can play with me now,
don't you?

216
01:10:36,215 --> 01:10:38,615
You fucking ghost

217
01:10:50,863 --> 01:10:52,524
come out!

218
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:20,792
We have a laundry machine.
Why go through the trouble?

219
01:12:28,894 --> 01:12:30,418
Hello?

220
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:32,993
The police?

221
01:12:34,033 --> 01:12:35,796
Yes, I understand

222
01:12:37,703 --> 01:12:39,500
That bastard is out now

223
01:12:43,476 --> 01:12:46,570
Son of a bitch,
I dare you to show up

224
01:12:48,314 --> 01:12:49,906
Tell me

225
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:53,346
Tell me!

226
01:12:54,353 --> 01:12:57,015
Why'd you turn off your phone?

227
01:12:57,289 --> 01:13:00,281
- Know how many times I've called you?
- I told you!

228
01:13:00,359 --> 01:13:01,883
I told you many times!

229
01:13:02,361 --> 01:13:04,352
My battery ran out

230
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:07,592
Rotten bastard

231
01:13:07,933 --> 01:13:09,867
Think I'm that stupid?

232
01:13:10,369 --> 01:13:12,064
Who did you meet?

233
01:13:12,371 --> 01:13:15,238
What the hell's wrong with you?
Are you mentally sick?

234
01:13:15,374 --> 01:13:17,365
You made me this way

235
01:13:18,711 --> 01:13:21,874
Who's the girl who always
calls late at night?

236
01:13:22,047 --> 01:13:24,015
Let's stop this

237
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:27,585
Did you just hear something?

238
01:13:27,686 --> 01:13:29,984
- What are you talking about?
- Hold on

239
01:13:30,122 --> 01:13:32,056
I think someone's in the house

240
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:34,456
Who cares whether
someone's here or not

241
01:13:35,127 --> 01:13:38,426
- I'm the idiot for trusting...
- No, I'm certain someone's in here

242
01:13:38,631 --> 01:13:40,997
- Don't play the psycho act with me
- Hold on

243
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:43,759
Someone's here for sure

244
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:56,109
So who's here?

245
01:13:56,182 --> 01:13:57,809
I swear someone's here

246
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:00,478
I don't wanna hear it!
I don't trust you at all!

247
01:14:04,256 --> 01:14:06,121
You see?
I told you someone was here

248
01:15:15,861 --> 01:15:18,421
Oh my goodness!
You scared me

249
01:15:18,530 --> 01:15:21,158
I did? So how was your day?

250
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:22,461
Good

251
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:27,166
Why didn't you tidy up the sofa?

252
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,471
I did this morning

253
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:32,301
But why is it so messy?

254
01:15:32,678 --> 01:15:33,872
That's strange

255
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,254
Can't sleep?

256
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:49,550
Want me to sing you a lullaby?

257
01:15:52,598 --> 01:15:54,623
I miss you, too

258
01:15:57,069 --> 01:15:58,263
Wanna come over?

259
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,149
Hey, it's weird

260
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:17,451
It feels like someone's in my place

261
01:16:18,057 --> 01:16:19,285
Yeah

262
01:16:19,959 --> 01:16:21,119
Then hurry up

263
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,322
So who's in your place?

264
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:54,058
I didn't see anyone.
I just felt it

265
01:16:54,493 --> 01:16:55,926
That's impossible

266
01:16:56,996 --> 01:16:58,725
Am I just being too sensitive?

267
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:05,261
- Isn't this your work?
- You haven't seen it yet?

268
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:06,963
- Can I look at it?
- Yup

269
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:14,808
- Stop it
- Come on

270
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:28,191
- I thought someone was here?
- Let him watch

271
01:17:39,038 --> 01:17:41,404
- What's wrong?
- I think someone's watching

272
01:17:41,874 --> 01:17:43,398
I'm scared

273
01:17:43,842 --> 01:17:46,572
You see? What did I tell you?

274
01:17:56,955 --> 01:17:57,887
What is it?

275
01:17:57,990 --> 01:18:00,322
Why'd you hang up an empty frame?
It's creepy

276
01:19:08,894 --> 01:19:10,919
I think someone's here

277
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:12,896
could it be him?

278
01:19:22,207 --> 01:19:24,266
He's bad luck,
that son of a bitch

279
01:19:26,645 --> 01:19:29,478
Honey, stay still

280
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:47,915
What are you doing up?

281
01:20:52,297 --> 01:20:53,662
I love you

282
01:20:54,499 --> 01:20:55,625
What?

283
01:21:03,809 --> 01:21:05,299
Honey...

284
01:21:55,794 --> 01:21:57,421
Breakfast is ready!

285
01:22:23,822 --> 01:22:26,689
What's made you so happy?
Stop smiling and eat

286
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:33,056
It's strange

287
01:22:33,665 --> 01:22:35,826
It feels like someone's been here
since last night

288
01:22:57,055 --> 01:22:58,955
What are you laughing for?

289
01:22:59,157 --> 01:23:00,522
Are you that happy?

290
01:23:15,841 --> 01:23:17,399
Don't open the door
to just anybody
