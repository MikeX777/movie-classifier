1
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,579
Janitor!
Janitor! Mr. Antonio!

2
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,454
What is it?
- The elevator in building 8 stalled!

3
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,973
One moment.

4
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,892
Antonio!
Antonio!

5
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,174
<i>Do you understand that the janitor
must always know where the keys are?</i>

6
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,814
What's this anarchy? One never knows
where the key to the terrace is.

7
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,774
You see this hat? Well,
the key to the terrace belongs there.

8
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,170
To me, the kay, Dionira gave it.

9
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,296
The kay?
I'll give you the kay!

10
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,455
Say, stranger,..

11
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,175
when you're through washing these four
rags, the kay...bring it back to me.

12
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,452
Else, the kay, will land on your head.
- Mr. Antonio! - What is it?

13
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,656
There's your wife calling for you.

14
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,059
<i>Antonio!</i>
- What's up?

15
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,253
The elevator in building 8 stalled!

16
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,339
For a change.
I'm coming.

17
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,859
Did you see? Because of you
the elevator stalled.

18
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,971
What have I got to do with it?
- By telepathy.

19
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,852
Yes, telepathy, telepathy...

20
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,169
Coming!

21
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,569
Unblocking!

22
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,777
Every week the same old story,
with this elevator.

23
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,811
Sure, but the janitor though! - What
about him? It's not him who built it.

24
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,529
But nothing works here!
I've been stuck for a half hour!

25
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,332
What's the janitor doing?

26
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,811
Oh, at last!
- Why didn't you try to unblock it?

27
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,132
I did try, but it won't move.
- Who's in the elevator?

28
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,939
The new administrator.
- Ah, a great start!

29
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,573
Hop! Hop!

30
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,178
Ah, here's the janitor.

31
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,496
Flying!

32
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,291
Here I am. <i>- You made up your mind
at last? Will you open now?</i>

33
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,493
It stalled, eh?
- What, shall I spend the night here?

34
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,292
As you wish.
- How, as I wish?

35
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,180
I mean, how can you wish to spend
the night? It's impossible.

36
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,499
<i>Then open it.</i>
- Right away.

37
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,815
These elevators are a pain in the neck,
they stall.

38
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,171
You must fix it every five minutes.
- What are you doing?! Open it!

39
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,776
I was explaining to these people how
to unblock it. Coming!

40
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,493
This is the key.

41
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,813
Here we got to fiddle around...
I know the secret.

42
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,539
One got to be cut out to be a janitor!

43
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,337
Ah, at last! - Give me your
revered hand. - Here it is.

44
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,451
<i>How goes it?  Well.
- Good... - How, good!</i>

45
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,253
No, I mean, how goes it there?
- Bad! What do you think?

46
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,372
Come, say with me: oh!
- Oh! Oh! - Oh!

47
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,458
No, you're doing a counterpoint.
Keep my time.

48
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,179
Together: O-oh! O-oh!

49
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,018
Together: O-oh! O-oh!

50
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,818
Damn, it's heavy! There!

51
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,572
What are you doing now?
Stay up! Stand up!

52
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,452
Sorry, you got dirty. - Gentlemen,
the show is over. You may go.

53
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,140
What are you looking at?
This wretch who went to...

54
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,534
Who's a wretch?!

55
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,618
A wreck...A wreck, no?
- It is a shame!

56
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,936
Good evening, sir. - Good evening.
- Good evening. - Good evening.

57
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,217
This way. Mr. accountant,
you must excuse me. - Sure, sure...

58
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,811
Quite a nice show!
- Forgive them, they're modest people,..

59
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,330
they never go to a show, and they try
and have fun at any chance they get.

60
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,655
Did you see how they laughed?
- The fun was on me.

61
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,772
But, do you know who I am? - Of course!
The new building administrator.

62
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,652
Ragionier Casoria.
- Ragionier Casoria.

63
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,250
I'm here for an inspection, and it looks
bad, very bad: clothes hung out,..

64
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,530
..untidiness, cats, cats everywhere!

65
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,529
Mr. Casoria, you have to turn
a blind eye. - Not at all!

66
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,859
This building is left unattended.

67
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,889
And, frankly, the real estate firm
is not too happy with the janitor.

68
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,413
No?
- No!

69
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,576
No, no. And why weren't you in the
porter's lodge when I came here?

70
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,928
There was my wife..

71
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,732
and my wife is German.
- So what?

72
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,456
With a German keeping guard at the
door, not any and all will pass!

73
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,697
Then, our lodge is a sieve.
People get sieved.

74
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,414
Only tenants and important people
pass through.

75
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,612
<i>Bottigliaro! (Bottle collector)</i>

76
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,933
And who is that? - Someone calling
a tenant, Mr. Bottigliaro.

77
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,369
Come on, please...
- Do you want to see the boilers' room?

78
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,491
Yes, yes, let's go to the boilers,
quick.

79
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,499
Eh, definitely, dear Antonio, here
everything leaves a lot to be desired...

80
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,137
You see, Mr. Casoria, I do my best,
but the events,..

81
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,939
the elevator and the cats are often
against me.

82
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,457
Eh, I agree. Maybe a younger janitor
would manage better,..

83
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,095
but I've got a family as well and
I well realize...

84
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,169
No, no, I won't report you to the
real eastate management.

85
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,495
I...
- This time I too will turn a blind eye.

86
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,135
I thank you and I don't know just how
to show you my gratitude.

87
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,616
If you got an idea, tell me,
so that I can show you.

88
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,652
Well, for instance, be careful!
I'll show you right away...

89
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,099
You see, here you can..

90
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,730
easily clash. Even knowing the way,
I myself often clash with it.

91
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,416
Thank you.
- You need to do this way. - Thank you.

92
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,050
See, dear Bonocore, the main thing is
that you perform your duty.

93
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,455
Duty before all!
- I do it.

94
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,532
I'm on your side,
you try and stay on mine.

95
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,051
How... If you allow me, I'll open
the door. I'll show the way.

96
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,008
Come in.

97
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,618
Come in.
- Thank you.

98
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,532
Do you feed the boiler?
-Yessir. I cover the fireman chores too.

99
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,536
It's hot in here, too hot.
- I'd say, we're near the stove.

100
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,249
No, in general, the building too
must be overheated.

101
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,777
Yes? But there's who doesn't
share your opinion. You say it is,..

102
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,840
patience, if you say so!
- For this, the monthly supply..

103
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,579
of coal seems a bit exaggerated, no?

104
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,495
Look, the boiler devours plenty.
Twelve tons are barely enough already.

105
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,656
And then, the cost estimate
is made by the administration.

106
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,372
Rightly they're called estimates..

107
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,775
because they're made previously,..

108
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,250
but then, in practice,
things change, eh!

109
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,249
And just how?

110
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:47,890
One says 12 tons, but then
he gets by with 4.

111
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,900
This, it's only for us to know.

112
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,017
Mr. accountant Casoria, back home,
this..

113
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,812
we call it a fraud.
- What? - Yes, fraud!

114
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,335
I didn't say this, eh!
- You didn't?

115
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,734
No, no.
- I had thought...

116
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,694
I said I was on your side.
- I thank you really much,..

117
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,814
but on my side it's cold
and twelve tons are barely enough.

118
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,814
Alright. I just wanted to reduce
the building's expenses.

119
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,537
It means we'll have to remember
this too, Antonio Bonocore.

120
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,133
Goodbye.

121
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,657
Hell!

122
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,655
Ah!

123
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,853
I'm hungry!
- Get this stuff away from here you.

124
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,170
By Jove!
A letter from Michele.

125
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,652
Say , Michele wrote!
<i>- Oh, at last!</i>

126
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,931
Mustafà! Down! Don't usurp the master's
place! Down!

127
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,816
He's terrible, you know. Well...

128
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,608
Here we are.

129
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,849
Let's see.

130
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,255
What does he write?
- Rather, what do you write him?

131
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,852
As if that poor boy could help us!
With what the Army pays, you've had it!

132
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,015
Take.

133
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,489
Why do you mix it with water?
Why do you mix it with water?

134
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,299
I didn't put water.
- Ah, ''I didn't put water'' ,..

135
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,690
then I did,
mister Führer.

136
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,617
I said it many times: ''Let's buy less
of it! Less, but let it be wine''.

137
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,934
To me two drops are enough. one drop,
a droplet, but let it be wine!

138
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,891
Answer. the telefunken!

139
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,416
Say' ''Prronto! (hello)''. Come on.

140
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,339
Prronto. This is the porter's lodge.
Yes, right away.

141
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,137
For you!
- Jawohl, meine Frau. Danke schön.

142
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:13,048
Prronto! Yes, it's me.
Good evening, Mr. Pizzigoni!

143
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,058
Say, say. Tell me...

144
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,896
Eh? I'm sorry but I have no availability
as of yet, well.

145
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,609
Yes, I know it's due. What shall I say,
I'm waiting for a payment..

146
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,215
and unfortunately they haven't paid yet.

147
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,931
<i>Be patient for a few more days.</i>
Be generous, be patie -- Hello?

148
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,734
Mr. Pizzigoni?

149
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,055
Mr. Pizzigoni!
He left.

150
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:47,652
Down, down Mustafà! - Go away! This dog,
one of these days, I'll kill him.

151
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,570
And with his skin I'll make me an
astrakan fur collar for my coat.

152
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,498
What are you going to do dad?
- Nothing, what do you think?

153
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,219
<i>Janitor!</i> - Good evening, doctor.
How's Mr. Andrea? Not well, eh?

154
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,809
Shall I take him the milk?
- I wanted to remind you.

155
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,408
Good evening, doctor.
- I was having a bite.

156
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,130
So, are you going now?
- Yessir.

157
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,570
Folks, keep an eye to the lodge!
I'm taking the milk to the doomed one.

158
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,292
<i>Alright.</i>

159
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,694
Disgusting!

160
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,097
What a result!
After 40 years of service,..

161
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,889
guess how much I get from my retirement?
Do you know?

162
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:34,210
I know: 28.000 lire a month.
- And what's the pretext, do you know?

163
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:40,372
Because you have no wife nor children.
- As if that were an advantage.

164
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,132
It is, chevalier, believe me.

165
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,048
Believe me! Come!

166
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,978
What was that? - A fly.
- Ah! - Don't worry, it's dead.

167
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,089
Come, just a drop! - No.
- A drop of warm milk. - No, no.

168
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,216
No? Then a small pill?
- No, never mind,..

169
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,338
medicines are of no use anyway, now.

170
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,936
Dear chevalier, you are troubled by
senile pessimism, believe me!

171
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,258
Antonio.
- What?

172
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,731
Antonio,
I have to reveal a secret.

173
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,131
A secret?
- Yes. - To me? Let's hear.

174
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,777
What's up?
- It's a secret..

175
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,456
that's oppressing me since a long time.

176
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,459
Tell me, tell me.
- I decided to reveal it to you..

177
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,498
because I have
no relatives nor friends..

178
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,692
and you are a gentleman.

179
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:38,017
Well, it was during my last year of
service at the State Mint.

180
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,254
I was an engraver.

181
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,332
Right in that period we printed
the new 10.000 banknote.

182
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,574
The present paper currency.

183
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,694
Ah, yes, I heard some talk about
10.000 bills circulating.

184
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,215
As always,
several clichés were engraved.

185
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,138
I was about to retire.

186
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,897
I was so embittered, so depressed!

187
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,615
You know how one feels when he's left
aside? - Tell me about it!

188
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,814
And so, I made one copy disappear.
- Ah!

189
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,815
A copy of what?
- Of cliché. - Ah!

190
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,053
And I took some paper too.
- White?

191
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,650
- Watermarked.
- Wa...? - Watermarked.

192
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:32,416
In a few words, what one needs to..

193
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,254
to make the 10.000 banknotes.

194
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,849
I get it. Chevalier, I've got much
to do. Also lock the main door.

195
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,456
No, Antonio, don't leave me like this.
I'm not through yet.

196
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,970
You were always so good to me.
- What good and good!

197
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,775
I'm a law abiding citizen!
Do you know what that means?

198
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,097
If you don't, find out about. Now
I should go to the police station..

199
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,178
and report you.
- No, don't talk this way.

200
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,777
Listen to me.
- Holy...

201
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:09,332
If you knew for how long I had this
torment, but I want to remedy, now.

202
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,938
What remedy? Here, at any moment...
Time is short!

203
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,252
Antonio, you see that bag on
the cupboard? - Which one?

204
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,256
That one? - Yes. - Well?
- Would you get it, please?

205
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,699
What?
Are we getting crazy?

206
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,618
So I'll leave my singerprints!

207
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,572
Fingerprints.
- Fingerprints.

208
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,175
But I haven't told you yet
what's inside.

209
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,972
Don't tell me,
I don't want to know.

210
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,092
There are the clichés
and the watermark paper.

211
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,410
I never touched them.
- Possible?

212
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,333
Never.
- You never...whatever? - Never.

213
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,739
I never fabricated one single bill,..

214
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,371
I swear.
- I believe you.

215
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,535
The intention,
I had it many times,..

216
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,417
but never the courage.
- Excuse me, what's it to me?

217
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,536
Antonio, I'm about to leave.
- Eh, yes.

218
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,049
I mean, eh yes, that'll be the day!

219
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,899
You are on earth on a permanent basis,
I tell you.

220
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:10,890
Just think if, when I'm dead, this stuff
should fall into dishonest hands.

221
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,896
I couldn't find peace.
It must be destroyed!

222
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,053
But, excuse me, why do you want to give
right to me this hard nut to crack?

223
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,648
And then, why should you leave?
You'll be alright!

224
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,659
And you'll see that, slowly, with your
little legs, tippety tappety,..

225
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,055
you'll go to the river and
destroy the bag.

226
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:33,459
This says Antonio Bonocore!
- Yes, if I couldn't do it,..

227
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,780
you've got to promise me that you will.

228
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,888
This is my last will.
- This is a blackmail, excuse me!

229
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,377
Do you promise?
- Okay, I promise.

230
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,210
Oh, now for sure..

231
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,416
I can die in peace and serenity.

232
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,218
You are obsessed with it, excuse me!

233
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,810
You have mortuary persecution mania,
pardon my saying so.

234
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,012
What's all this talk about dying!
You're bursting with health!

235
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,974
You've got the pulse of a bull.
I wish I had that pulse!

236
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,977
I'd be in America now.

237
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,368
Listen:

238
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,609
one,..

239
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,209
two,..

240
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,408
three...

241
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,610
Hey! Damn it!

242
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,936
The communication cut off.

243
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,652
Eh, it's always the best that leave!
What can you do? That's life!

244
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,850
Today it's his turn, tomorrow it'll be
yours. - But...

245
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,851
Goodbye.
- Have a good day.

246
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,571
And this is done too.

247
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:30,618
One at a time...
- What a fate, what a fate, poor soul!

248
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:36,339
And he wasn't even that old.
- What are you saying?

249
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,249
Do you know how old
Mr. Andrea was? 93.

250
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,856
So? - How, so? He took the
first communion with Garibaldi!

251
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,690
<i>Excuse me?</i>
- Who is it? Come in!

252
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,538
Excuse me, Mr. Antonio.
- Tell me.

253
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,339
I see you already removed
the signature book.

254
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,049
Yes, it's true. See, these books
are for the relatives.

255
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,855
Mr. Andrea,
poor soul, was alone.

256
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:12,449
I'd care about, how do you say,
as a token of respect for...

257
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,339
A little signature? I had put it away.

258
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,250
I'll go fetch it.
- Right, a...

259
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,133
A good person Mr. Andrea, eh?
- Eh, yes.

260
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,332
She's right, mommy, those who leave...
- ...always the best ones,..

261
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,212
always the best ones leave.

262
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,689
Mommy went to the funeral.
- Good!

263
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,818
Unfortunately I couldn't.
- Me neither.

264
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,854
But I sent my wife and the children.
So they take their minds off things...

265
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,057
and take a breath of fresh air,
they're always locked in here...

266
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,257
Goodbye, Mr. Antonio.
Madam... - Good day.

267
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,936
<i>Who are you? Where are you going?</i>

268
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,097
<i>You must tell me who you are.
Easy, easy, Mrs. bride!</i>

269
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,575
We're not stealing anything, no?

270
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,778
Well, how does it look?

271
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,015
Excuse me, but just who are you?
What do you want?

272
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,779
Why, who would you be?
- How, who am I? Can't you see me?

273
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,937
I'm the janitor!
- Ah, so you're the janitor? Far out!

274
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,139
Well! I'm pleased! I see
you already got your luggage ready...

275
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,013
<i>What luggage! But what do they want?</i>
- Mah...

276
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:16,170
Good, getting out of the way already,
but there's time! It's premature!

277
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,178
Excuse me, I was passing by with my
fiancée, so I said:

278
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,009
well, let's get in and check the site
just to get the idea.

279
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,138
Ya know, Ferna', here I'd put
a cintz sofa ,..

280
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,212
so it would brighten things a little.
- Yes. The floor..

281
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:33,129
is really in bad shape, it's filthy.
- Eh, yes, it's filthy. - Eh.

282
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,896
I'm mortified. I beg your forgiveness,
in behalf of the floor.

283
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,250
What? - Had I known,
I would have wrapped it for you.

284
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,610
No, but you got nothing to do with it.

285
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,052
Excuse me, can you smell? This faint
stink of cabbage in the whole house?

286
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,614
It's got to get away, this stink.
We need to freshen up everything!

287
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,539
<i>We'll call the Refulgent!</i>
- Refulgent? We'll call the firemen.

288
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,055
Better yet, you know what I'll do?
I call the police. - No!

289
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,853
What, are you crazy?
This one got upset!

290
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:05,048
We are colleagues! Eh, good Lord!
- What are we? Colleagues?

291
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,054
Why, are you a janitor?
- Not me, but I'll soon become one.

292
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,537
You'll become one? My friend,
one is born janitor, cannot become one!

293
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,970
You're kidding! But then, shall we argue
now? Eventually, when I'll relieve you.

294
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:24,295
Why, didn't you receive the notice
from the administrator? - No.

295
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,414
How, you don't know that
he's a friend of mine? Mr. Casoria!

296
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,538
Casoria? - He's intimate...
Then, many excuses.

297
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,458
Have patience.
How could I know?

298
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,810
Goodbye madam.
Let's go!

299
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,654
Let's go, move! That poor man
almost had a stroke. Good day!

300
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,050
Mamma mia, what is happening to us!

301
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,490
Clever Mr. accountant Casoria!

302
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,371
(Didn't you receive a notice
from the administrator?)

303
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,889
(The administrator is a friend of mine,
Mr. Casoria!)

304
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,373
(He didn't give you a...)

305
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,896
(In short, what it takes to print
10.000 banknotes.)

306
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,210
(When I'll relieve you!)

307
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,970
(Watermarked paper and clichés
to fabricate 10.000 banknotes.)

308
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,258
So, overnight, to throw
a family out in the street!

309
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,931
Come, it's not sure yet. After all,
we haven't got the notice yet.

310
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,733
Will you stop fiddling with that radio?

311
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,169
You reckless! Cretin!
- Hoof!

312
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,335
What a pain, my child!

313
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,056
Come dear, grandmom's darling...
- Where did Antonio go?

314
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,891
I don't understand a thing!

315
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:11,332
I told him I couldn't wait any longer,
then I'll see you tonight.

316
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,132
Let's hope he'll come!

317
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,331
Casa....
Casamassima, Casamassima.

318
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,855
Altobelli.
Altobelli.

319
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:30,569
Lo Turco. Lo Turco.
Sender: Bordini & Stocchetti.

320
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:37,370
Bordini & Stocchetti. This means
bills. Bills...

321
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,897
Good morning! - Pity!
I just put it in.

322
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,616
There was an envelope...
Bordini & Stocchetti.

323
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,449
Ah! The same old overdue, eh?

324
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,177
How is your son? Does he write you?
- Michele is fine, and he writes.

325
00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:01,097
Today broccoli and potatoes again, eh?
- My dad and my brother like'm.

326
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,570
And they're not wrong. Broccoli and
potatoes is a vitaminic food,..

327
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,090
..nourishing,
corroborant and...light.

328
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,212
Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

329
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,728
<''Giuseppe Lo Turco, printer.
Printer...

330
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,613
Printer...

331
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,373
Printer...

332
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,373
Printer's shop

333
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,937
What did you write? Read!

334
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,850
''Doctor Luigi Biffignardi,
chevaglier of labour.

335
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,934
Chevaglier?
Chevaglier...with ''g''?

336
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,529
With ''l'' ! Chevalier!
- I'll take it out now.

337
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,578
Fix it, you ass!

338
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,232
Then, in your opinion, do you spell
''rock'' or ''roch''?

339
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,408
Ass!

340
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,208
Roch...

341
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,975
Did you oil the printer?
- I oigled it. - Oiled!

342
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,054
I'll kill you!

343
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,971
Good morning, Mr. Lo Turzo!
- Lo Tu... Why do you laugh? - Ah, dad!

344
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,655
Lo Turco.
- Ah, true. Excuse me.

345
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,414
Why do you laugh?

346
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,050
What's up?
We work,, eh? We work?

347
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,456
<i>Thank God, we work.
And you, what brought you here?</i>

348
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:52,057
I was passing by and I said to myself:
''Let's pay a visit to Lo Curto''.

349
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,978
Lo Turco.
- To Lo Turco.

350
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,970
Am I disturbing?
- No, not at all.

351
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,694
It's almost lunch time.
- Oh, thank goodness.

352
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,811
This one, when it's a matter of food...

353
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,818
It's youth... - If you want to talk
to me, have a seat.

354
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,135
No, it's time for lunch,
I'm leaving too.

355
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,493
Broccoli and potatoes, eh?
- Eh, well...

356
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,856
I'll have spaghetti with clams, instead,
and pizzaiola veal.

357
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,410
Excuse me, didn't you say
you're having broccoli and potatoes?

358
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,932
You are having those! - Ah, me?
- Alright, then I'll go to my aunt's.

359
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,893
Of course, rather than have
broccoli and potatoes...

360
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,774
But, excuse me, who told you I'm
having broccoli and potatoes?

361
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,460
How, who told me?
Your daughter, of course!

362
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,775
Why, is my daugher putting up posters?

363
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,653
What happened? - Don Antonio!

364
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,856
You almost broke my finger!

365
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,659
And you put your hand under there?
- But how? Me?

366
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:48,297
Be more careful, you're not a boy,
you're a man!

367
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,616
I don't get it. Why would one
put his hand under the machinery!

368
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,174
Those are machines, not
reasoning men.

369
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,451
Machinery is made of metal!
- You always want to joke,..

370
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,094
luchy you. Today is not
a good day for me.

371
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:02,132
Alright, alright...
Don't get upset.

372
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,209
We all have our worries.
You, deep down, are a privileged man,..

373
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,377
you have an enstablished firm,
a factory. - A factory!

374
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,934
Like what, the Fiat, the Montecatini?

375
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,736
I hear a noise. Don't you hear a strange
noise? - Yes, I hear it too.

376
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,737
A noise like...

377
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,489
Something like...
- ...this one? - Eh.

378
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,976
Is it you? - Eh! - Don Antonio,
please, you're worrying me.

379
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,456
The new machine, just arrived.
- This one? - Of course.

380
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,658
A new machine?
- This the famous pla-ten-pre-ss.

381
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,176
The famous?
- Platen press. 100 copies per minute.

382
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,851
By Jove! - A phenomenon!
It's a phenomenon this one. - 100...

383
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,730
And how many would it make in one day?
- 50.

384
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,329
It seems there's a slight discrepancy.
- There is. 100 copies per minute..

385
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,611
it would make them, but my work is
cut back, so it only makes 50.

386
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,449
I got it. - Unfortunately,
nobody orders business cards anymore.

387
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:59,413
People meet, greet each other,
bye, so long, good night...

388
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,576
There's rack of capital!
- Lack, lack.

389
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,578
Lack of capital, that's the problem.
- Unfortunately.

390
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,770
And what brand is this plate?

391
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,090
What plate?
- Yours. This one.

392
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,219
What plate? It's not a dish.
Pla-ten-pre-ss.

393
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,089
Ah, platenpress. What brand is it?
- Bordini & Stocchetti, from Turin.

394
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,298
By Jove, Bordini & Stocchetti!
I heard about them.

395
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,695
It's a great firm.
- By the way!

396
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,335
Speaking of Bordini & Stocchetti.
This morning, in the lodge,..

397
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,373
there was a letter for you.
- A letter? - Eh!

398
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,813
What was it, a notice?
- No, no. A bill of payment.

399
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,893
Ah! Real good.

400
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,094
Thank you, don Antonio. You brought me
the appetizer for the broccoli.

401
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,809
I'm just a janitor...
- I know, thanks so much. A bill...

402
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,619
After you.
- No, by all means.

403
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,537
Please.
- No, it's your home.

404
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,729
You wish so?
- Thank you.

405
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,772
Excuse me. Did you want to go through?
- Come on! - Thank you.

406
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,617
I'll take care of it!
- No, don't bother.

407
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,971
Leave it to me. - God forbid!
- I'll shut! Why bother?

408
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,738
You wish so?
- You wish so?

409
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,134
Alright...

410
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,613
So, what're you doing?

411
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,930
You leave it open?
- You said you'd close it!

412
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,256
Let me do that!

413
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,533
Are you hurt?
- But you are the end!

414
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,049
I'm so sorry, I didn't know...

415
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,455
Let me do it.
I'll take care of my own things.

416
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,332
But you put your foot underneath!

417
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,650
I'll say...
- Leave me alone.

418
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,328
Well then...

419
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,418
Mr. Turchesi, I wanted...
- Lo Turco. - Lo Turco,..

420
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,053
I'd like to ask a question:

421
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,899
have you ever made fake business cards,
yes?

422
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,373
How do you mean?

423
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,492
On these cards,
one writes what he wants..

424
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,770
or does it take some State rule,
some Agency?

425
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,414
No, what Agency!
One writes what he wishes.

426
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,532
If he's a commendatore, commendatore,
is he is cavaliere, cavaliere,..

427
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,538
if he has a title, he'll put his title.
There are some who..

428
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,174
think themselves important...
- ...and are even less..

429
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,779
Eh.
- than nothing.

430
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,172
They might even be forgers.

431
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,740
How do you mean?
- Well, I mean... eh?

432
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,818
Eh?
- Well, I mean... eh?

433
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,457
I didn't quite get this.

434
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,855
May I offer you a coffee? Yes?

435
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,128
Let's go.

436
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,450
Come.
- Eh...

437
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,614
<i>Wait and see.</i>
- OK, let's see.

438
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,129
So there.

439
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,213
Well then, Mr. Lo Tripoli...
- Lo Turco!

440
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,016
Mr. Lo Turco, so sorry,
listen to me. This is you.

441
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,331
This cup?
- This cup.

442
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,731
This, instead, is the other one.
The capitalist. - The other cup?

443
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,856
The exploiter.
The other cup.

444
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,858
This, instead, is the capital.
- The sugar.

445
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,849
Eh, no, one moment, or it's useless.
Let me do.

446
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,851
So, originally they're both without
sugar, that is:

447
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,899
..Lo Turzo... - Turco!
- Lo Turzo and La Terza, eh, tarza.

448
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,773
La tarza e Lo Turzo.

449
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:04,176
Lo Turco! - Lo Turco.
- What would you do? - What would I do?

450
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,696
You see? You don't even know.
This one, instead, he knows it.

451
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,898
He knows, and he takes advantage.

452
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,489
What do you think?
- That he will stop, sooner or later.

453
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,535
You think so because you're an honest
man and you trust your fellow men.

454
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,813
This one instead is not!
And he keeps going. Look here.

455
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,214
And he goes on, ad on, and on.
- He goes on forever? - Forever!

456
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:33,576
No, you don't go on anymore,
or else you pay a supplement.

457
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,852
High-handedness, there!
This would be the only solution!

458
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,574
High-handedness? - Eh, yes. because,
frankly, dear mister...

459
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,972
Lo Turco. - People like you let
other people step on their toes.

460
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,292
On their toes?
- Eh, yes.

461
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,089
Because, you see, mister...
- Lo Turco. - Lo Turzo.

462
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:56,089
Lo Turco! See, you represent the sane,
honest, clean side..

463
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:00,412
of the Country. Vice versa, those,
represent the...side.... Clear?

464
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,340
But those...who?
- Who are we talking about?

465
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,576
About the speculators, the greedy,..

466
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,493
the exploiters, that is: about
accountant Casoria.

467
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:12,369
But who is this accountant Casoria
that jumps out every now and then?

468
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,292
He's the one that swipes the sugar.

469
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,014
Casoria swipes the sugar?
- And tha coal as well.

470
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,893
Sugar and coal?
- Right. - And he doesn't go to jail?

471
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,618
No, because they're smart.

472
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,618
They border the penal code,
but they don't breech it.

473
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,938
Look, look at that guy.
Don't look though.

474
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,932
Look!
But don't look.

475
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,857
How can I look
without looking?

476
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,936
Look, but don't show you're looking.

477
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,732
That will do?
- Yes.

478
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,056
That one....
- Who is that?

479
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,774
Accountant Casoria?
- What Casoria! Close by...

480
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,776
Close by? Frattamaggiore?

481
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,175
Eh, Frattamaggiore...
- Caivano? - What Caivano!

482
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,939
- Ooh! - Torre Annunziata?
Santa Maria Capua Vetere?

483
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,698
I did not tell you before,
out of courtesy,..

484
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,129
but you really are an idiot!
- So?

485
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,976
How, so?
Nobody ever told you?

486
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,216
Well, no. Now that you told me,
what shall I do?

487
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,252
There would be a solution.
- Ah, there is one?

488
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,853
Right. To conform.

489
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,779
To conform.
- Come with me!

490
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,972
Did you say to conform?
- This is the secret.

491
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,170
What secret?
- If I were you, I'd conform.

492
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,971
Listen, you have a bill overdue. - Eh!

493
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,610
You don't have a dime, work is slow.
- How right!

494
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,174
You've got shoes with patches,
over and under.

495
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,616
If I were you, I'd conform.
- Alright, I'll conform,..

496
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,412
but how?
- How, how?

497
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,496
We cross to the other side.
- That way?

498
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,418
No, we cross, we jump the obstacle
with both feet together

499
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:40,219
But how? - But how? Desertion, there!
- But we desert...where?

500
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,014
We pass on the side of
accountant Casoria and friends!

501
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,576
Casoria and friends?
- You didn't get it?

502
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,452
Well, really, I...

503
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,933
Who is it? - Who is it?
- What happened? - Is there danger?

504
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,931
No, I mean, what's up?
- Who is it?

505
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,971
Will you listen to me?
- I am!

506
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,409
If you give me one minute of your time.
of patience,..

507
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,293
I'll explain you one thing
that might interest you.

508
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,617
Let's go there. - In the subway?
- There's hardly anyone.

509
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,090
- Eh, but...
- Come with me, listen.

510
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,934
I've got a family! God forbid!
What entered your mind?

511
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,574
Listen to your blood's voice!
<i>Whose voice?</i>

512
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,776
I admit they're very well done.
- Aren't they? They're authentic!

513
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,456
What an engraving! Magnificent.

514
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:13,219
And the paper! Did you see it?
Look at this paper!

515
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,178
The paper... - Magnificent!
- It seems a bit too long...

516
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,860
Oh yes, I got the wrong paper.
This is the family one!

517
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,258
This one. This is watermarked.
- Of course!

518
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,895
It comes from the State Ming!
- Mint. - Mint.

519
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,936
Was I right?
- Eh, yes. Yes, yes.

520
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,210
Then let's get to practice, shall we?

521
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,771
God forbid, don Antonio, I just gave it
a look...so, just as an amateur...

522
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:43,215
Just think what a satisfaction for
a typographer:

523
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,730
to switch from business cards
to 10.000 banknotes!

524
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,770
All considered, don Anto',
let's face it:

525
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,090
I'm only expert in black and white.

526
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,696
Here you have to deal with
ink qualities, nuances,..

527
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,936
shades...
It takes an expert!

528
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,019
Right! Now we pull in the third man!
Don't make me laugh!

529
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,256
But it's necessary.
It would be necessary.

530
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,610
It would take one
who knows about colors.

531
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,813
Colors?
- Eh!

532
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,529
A painter would do?
- Eh. - I have one.

533
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,928
But is he an artist?

534
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:25,691
Artist? He's a great artist!

535
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,334
Is it that one?

536
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,531
Eh.
- Is that the painter?

537
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,858
Why, isn't he fit?

538
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,173
Oh, Mr. Lo Struzzo...
- Lo Turco. - Lo Turco.

539
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,093
Who do we want to get? Picasso?
De Chirico?

540
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,212
Shall we resuscitate Raffaello?
- I don't want to resuscitate anyone,..

541
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,252
but we need an artist here.
That one is a half whitewasher!

542
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,690
Don't curse, please!
That one is an artist!

543
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,969
Of course, he has to get by someteimes,
the poor soul.

544
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,137
But can we trust him?
- Sure enough, don't worry!

545
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,729
What,
when one is full of debts,..

546
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,977
has overdue bills, eviction pending,
is starving to death,..

547
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,172
you can trust him for sure!
Didn't I trust you maybe?

548
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,369
That's true.

549
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,180
Good morning, Cardone!
- Oh, Mr. Antonio!

550
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,973
How goes it, how goes it, how goes it?
Do you know mister...

551
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,734
Lo Turco. - No.
- Cardone, nice meeting you. - Pleased.

552
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,896
How, you never met?
- No.

553
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,410
Yet we live in the same building.
- But that's a bee-hive!

554
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,498
It's big.
- By the way, how's work going on?

555
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:35,893
So...not so bad.
- Well, there's some emphasis. - True.

556
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,854
<i>Oh well, there's a style,
a personality.</i>

557
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,935
I may know nothing about, but
it reminds me of Pinturicchio a bit.

558
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,929
His first manner.
- His first manner.

559
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,331
'Cause this manner here...
- It's the latest...- Yep, the last one.

560
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,137
By the way, Mr. Cardone,
there was this for you.

561
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,855
There was "urgent" written on it and
I deemed suitable to bring it to you.

562
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,172
It's from the administration.
- It's nothing, nothing!

563
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,618
Eh, nothing! Nothing, he says.
Mr. Pinturicchio, well? Then?

564
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,415
I don't poke my nose into the tenants'
business, but my eyes..

565
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,179
are trained, no?
That's a notice. - Ah!

566
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:15,173
It's a notice? - A notice!
A notice of eviction.

567
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,094
Mr. Antonio, you're mortifying me.
- What mortification! Because he's here?

568
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,609
He's starving wretch just like us!
- Don Antonio!

569
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,776
Starv...like us!
- Ah, like us!

570
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,973
In this age, one must resign oneself,..

571
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,694
and jump on accountant Casoria's side.

572
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,970
But it's right him who
wants to evict me!

573
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,489
This one didn't understand a thing!

574
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,258
Shall we buy him a coffee?
- Yes.

575
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,978
A coffee?
- Eh, with pleasure!

576
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,250
With lots of sugar?
- With lots of sugar.

577
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,608
Let's go.

578
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,131
So then, Cardone...

579
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,610
No, no, no.
- No?

580
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,613
No, no, no. It's not my field.

581
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,178
As long as we deal with enamel,..

582
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,571
oil paint...But here we deal with
fatty inks.

583
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:16,574
Fatty or lean, what's the difference?
- Eh, don Anto', I told you!

584
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,292
I had thought that...
- What did you think? A whitewasher.

585
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,729
Gianturco, don't swear.
This is an artist.

586
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,339
He acts so because...
Who knows why.

587
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,258
By now I'm on the dance floor,
and I got to dance...

588
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,130
Anyhow, Cardo', we must look straight
into each other's eyes.

589
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,820
Let's look into each own conscience.
- Let's look!

590
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,649
Let's speak straight: do you feel up to
it or not? - Do you?

591
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,329
He doesn't feel up to it.
- One moment, do you feel up to it?

592
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,973
I would...
- He does!

593
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,089
So?
- So?

594
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,211
With a little effort.
- Try your hardest...

595
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,854
don't be shy. It's between us.

596
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,698
So? - But we commit a sin.
- Do we commit a sin?

597
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,734
A mortal sin, we commit.
- Let's commit it, this mortal sin.

598
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,648
I've only got my mom.
- Let's not pull out the mom, Cardo'.

599
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:05,251
What if she knew?
No, I'm not game.

600
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,778
I want to sleep at night. I don't want
to be gnawed at by my conscience.

601
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,779
So you'd rather be gnawed at by hunger.
And the eviction notice?

602
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,449
Cardone! What, the eviction doesn't gnaw
at you? - But mom...

603
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:22,169
There we go again with mom...
Cardone my dear, we all got a mom!

604
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:27,495
Alright, let's try then.
- Oh! Come! Lo Turco!

605
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,329
Let's go, come on! Come, he made up his
mind! - No, no, no...

606
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,812
Leave me alone, please. I...
And I understand him too..

607
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,852
and what the reverend here said,
what's his name,..

608
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:43,815
Mr. Cardone. No, no. Guys, let's not
forget who I am.

609
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,540
I am a printer.
What's got into your minds?

610
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,534
It says it clearly here:
"The law will punish forgers..

611
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,413
and distributors of counterfeit bank
notes". That means jail!

612
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,896
That's the point! Because, we don't
distribute counterfeit bank-notes.

613
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,530
This cliche is authentic. Sacredly
authentic from the State mint!

614
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,056
Clear? Eventually, we might be
considered a branch office.

615
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,290
In French it would be called
a "dépendance".

616
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,894
If a shopkeeper happens
to get one of our bills,..

617
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,898
he looks at it and says: "This is a
bank-note from the dépendance."

618
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,693
"It's good. Give him the change."
Pò, pò, pò, and he pays us.

619
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,129
What change?
What, the mint outsourced you?

620
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,377
Don Antonio, don't talk nonsense.
No, no, let's call it quits.

621
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,809
So, let's give a kick to good luck.
- Let's give a kick --

622
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,296
I already gave it.
- Here, good luck! Get this, good luck!

623
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,456
Better not talk about it.
- Let's not talk about it any more.

624
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:32,129
Let's not talk about it. Never mind,
it was for fun, let's not talk about it.

625
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,490
Let's not talk about it any more!
- Any more.

626
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:39,459
I, though... - Did you talk?
This one talks about it.

627
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,650
You want to talk about it?
- Let's talk about it.

628
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,211
On second thought, basically,..

629
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,220
before the law, we are clean.

630
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,778
Even the paper is authentic.

631
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,489
At the most, it can be considered a
limited liability offence.

632
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,975
And what can they do to us?
What can they?

633
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,780
Alright, since
I'm on the dance floor...

634
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,211
I'll keep on dancing.
I dance. Do you dance?

635
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,616
I dance.
- Do you dance?

636
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,450
I don't dance. - How, I dance,
as a printer, and you don't?

637
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,253
Gentlemen,
I heard what you said here before..

638
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,372
both of you, with this ear.
I'm not deaf, you know?

639
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,572
He's got mommy and the painting job,
you got the printer's..

640
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,575
and I too, in the Italian middle class,
hold a social status.

641
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,737
Hats off!
- I've got a thriving porter's lodge,..

642
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,658
with tenants coming and going..

643
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,456
at Easter, Christmas and mid-August
they give me good tips...

644
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:36,898
For my name day they give me flowers,
candles, etcetera, and I've got..

645
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,778
three children.
- So?

646
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,290
So...let's not talk about it any more!
- Let's not talk about it any more!

647
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,092
It's over. - Let's forget it.
- We have never met.

648
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,291
Eh, and he sleeps!

649
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,495
No.

650
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,090
No.

651
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,899
God forbid.

652
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,135
Never.

653
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,616
You'll go to jail,
you'll go to jail.

654
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:27,530
As you see, my son, I hang on
to honor your uniform.

655
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,058
Good morning, Marce'.
- Hi, Riccardo. Dad?

656
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,740
Fast asleep.
- Today too.

657
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,894
Do you know that it's a week
that this story goes on?

658
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,600
Last night again he came back at 3:00.

659
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,857
He didn't turn the light on so as not
to wake me up. Like a burglar.

660
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:03,768
But what does he do? Where does he go?
- Mmmh...I can't see clearly into it.

661
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:08,699
Maybe he does some overtime at the shop?
- Yeah, at the shop!

662
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,700
The he goes to the winery.
- Yeah, to the winery!

663
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,290
Then you tell me where,
since you know it all!

664
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,896
There must be a woman...
- You think so?

665
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,213
Why not?
- I feel sorry.

666
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,411
After all, since when he's alone,
dad has always been so serious.

667
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,413
But, my dear, us men have our needs.

668
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:32,739
Go away, go!

669
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:36,413
Damn cats! If I get one, I'll eat it.

670
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,656
Filthy beasts!
Rascal felines!

671
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,215
Don't do that, they'll notice.
They hear this whistle... - No...

672
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,013
Tonight is the night?
- Let's hope so!

673
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,614
But we need a sample.
- A sample?

674
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,174
A real 10.000 note.
- And who's got one?

675
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,372
On the other hand, I cannot work
on memories, by heart.

676
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,774
How can we do?
- How can we do?

677
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,334
10.000 lire, who's got them?
- Check with Lo Turco.

678
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,850
Are you crazy? He's cried his eyes out!

679
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,971
To ask 10.000 lire to Lo Turco!

680
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,172
How can we do?
- How can we do?

681
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:20,252
I'll have to sacrifice myself.
- I regret it.

682
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,896
Me too. Just imagine!
The last family memento.

683
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,820
This was my father's,
an authentic sarcophagus!

684
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,249
A sarcophagus? - A French one!
- But this is a Roskoff!

685
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:32,019
Alright, a Roskoff, a sarcophagus,
it's just the same. - Beautiful!

686
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:35,496
I'll take it to Pizzigoni.
And let's hope that loan shark..

687
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,531
will give me a 10.000 lire bill.

688
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:42,893
I recommend you, a nice bill, large.
- Sure, a king size one!

689
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:47,093
Cardo', that bill is a standard size.
Please!

690
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:57,178
Well? - I need more red.
- Red. - Right away!

691
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:01,092
Here. - If you don't mind,
I'll put it on. - Be my guest!

692
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:03,211
I know how to do it.
- The master...

693
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,492
There, done.
- It's wonderful.

694
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,819
There we are!
- There we are!

695
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:14,494
Are we there?
- Yes. - Oh, excuse me!

696
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,814
The frame is just right.
- The frame fits just right. Precise!

697
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,858
Master, it's your turn. Go on!
- Yes, yes.

698
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,257
Water and soap!
- Water and soap! - Quick!

699
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,850
Towel!
- Towel! - Right away!

700
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,970
Towel, here it is.
- Towel...

701
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,895
Alcohol!
- Alcohol! - Alcohol coming!

702
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,500
Here is the alcohol.
Is it this one? Yes. - Yes.

703
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,897
Alcohol...
- Alcohol... - Solvent!

704
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:50,620
Solvent.
- Here is the solvent.

705
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:55,177
Careful, careful.
- I know how to do it. - Excuse me.

706
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,416
Done. - There!
- So then...What are you doing?

707
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,293
He's sipping the syrup!
This is not the moment!

708
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,618
Excuse me.
- What have you done? - Nothing...

709
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,937
Towel.
- Towel.

710
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,655
Have patience...
- Roll! - Roll!

711
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:17,250
Roll. - Roll.
- Roll, Roll really, eh!

712
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,450
The roll, don Antonio!
- It's almost roll.

713
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:22,572
But no, the roll, the roll!
- You mean that sort of rolling-pin?

714
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:27,137
Or else... - Here it is! - ..everything
gets mixed. - God forbid!

715
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,653
It's done.

716
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,978
- Eh, pasta dough.
All done.

717
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,735
We're set. The paper!
- Right away!

718
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,260
There.
- You always take it along, this paper?

719
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,618
For my comfort.
- #The watermark!#

720
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,393
#The watermark, the watermark,
tatatataratatÃ ....# Olé!

721
00:50:46,393 --> 00:50:48,212
Is this a time for joking?

722
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:52,015
Excuse me, it's the excitement,
the happiness! Here it is.

723
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:55,695
Careful! - Car --
- Be patient, I'm just a janitor.

724
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:59,256
Hey, guys, do you agree? Do you?

725
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:04,011
Do you? Do we!
- We do!

726
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,451
Ah, you agree?
- Ah! - We agree.

727
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,778
<i>Pliers.
- Pliers. - Pliers.</i>

728
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,888
<i>It's a miracle. It's a miracle.</i>

729
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:33,415
Here is. Soul of my wife, forgive me.
Don Anto'...

730
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,610
Blow you, accountant Casoria!

731
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:40,291
The first one. - I'm not feelig well.
- No, Cardone! - Hey, hey, hey!

732
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,014
A water sprinkle! - Where?
- On the face! - Right away!

733
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,576
Mamma mia...
- Oh my God! Cardo'!

734
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:59,694
I'd say to try there,
in that night bar.

735
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,997
We're spending our first fake
10.000 lire. - Yes. - Yes.

736
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,096
Go, go.
- How, go?

737
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,529
One moment, go...like this?
- It's your turn.

738
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,776
In this matter, we're partners.

739
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,414
Okay. - Let's count out who's going.

740
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,417
Let's count.
By him.

741
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,218
By the youngest.

742
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:19,696
By me, by me, by me...
- Six. - Six.

743
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:24,657
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
- But how did you count?

744
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:29,575
What?
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

745
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:37,493
No, no, no, there's a mistake.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. It's you.

746
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:43,295
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
- Listen, don't upset me.

747
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:48,892
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. It's you.
- I call myself out from the dispute.

748
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:54,209
He's out of the question.
- So then... Lo Turco, Lo Turco...

749
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:58,011
Four!
- 1, 2, 3 and 4.

750
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:01,610
You're a good printer,
but as a meter you're worth nothing.

751
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,253
Was it four?
- Four!

752
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:11,219
1, 2, 3 and 4. It's your turn.
- 1, 2, 3 and 4. It's your turn. Go!

753
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:15,089
Let's make it quick.
I'm out, be patient.

754
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,539
You call yourself out?
- Of course.

755
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,457
I'm competing by myself?
- By yourself.

756
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:23,017
Go, go, go, and remember
to spend the fake bill,..

757
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,177
not the good one.
- I made a cross mark on the good one.

758
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,416
Don't get confused.
- I'm going, eh? - Go.

759
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,656
So...well, I'm going.
- Sure, go!

760
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:33,858
Eh? - Eh?
- Did you call me?

761
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:37,854
No, no. Go! - Don't call me.
- But who's calling you?

762
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:50,220
5 soft cigarettes without filter,
please.

763
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:56,208
Here, 5 soft cigarettes without filter.
- Matches, please.

764
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:59,696
Ready! - Can you change them with
softer ones, please?

765
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,091
- Softer.
- Three Tuscan cigars!

766
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,258
These are soft.
- Three Tuscan cigars! - Thank you.

767
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,490
What can I serve you?
- Three Tuscan cigars.

768
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,816
I'm sorry, the Tuscans are finished.

769
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:18,094
Then give me a soap bar.
- A soap bar? Palmolive?

770
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,132
Yes, Palmolive will do.

771
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,330
Here it is, Palmolive.
- Thank you.

772
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,414
<i>One moment.</i>

773
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,333
<i>Here it is.</i>

774
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:44,337
That's it, 10.000.
- Thank you. Good night. <i>Good night.</i>

775
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,138
<i>Ah, listen, you!</i>
- Eh?

776
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:50,649
I found a Tuscan.
- It doesn't matter, thank you.

777
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:54,251
I'd better not smoke.
Good night. - Good night.

778
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,372
Matches, please.

779
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:21,533
<i>Who can it be at this time?</i>

780
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:25,534
One can never stay in peace!
Sie vergessen immer die Schlüssel!

781
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,259
Ach, diese Leute!

782
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,530
But who is it?
<i>It's me, Michele!</i>

783
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:38,097
Michele! Wie ist es möglich?
- Hi, mom!

784
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:41,769
Ich bin so glücklich!
- You weren't expecting me, eh? - No.

785
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,850
Komm' schnell! Come in! Come!

786
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,369
Come!

787
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:54,894
Mom, Michele is here!
<i>Michele!</i> - Grandma!

788
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,295
<i>My Michelone!</i>
- How are you?

789
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:02,580
How goes it?
- But you look younger! - Why, sure!

790
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:08,937
Hi! - Michele arrived!
We weren't expecting it, you know?

791
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,130
Come here, on my knees, up!

792
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:16,969
Also Mustafà!
- Mustafà! Come here! Up!

793
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:25,053
But couldn't you tell us?
- Better so, he made a nice surprise!

794
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,851
Are you on leave? - No, I'll explain
later. And dad, where is he?

795
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:37,890
I've decided: I'll make myself
a nice and well supplied wardrobe.

796
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:41,332
Everything double: two suits,
two shirts, two collars,..

797
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:45,135
two ties, two suspenders, two belts,
two pair of pants,..

798
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:50,852
two underwear, two handkerchiefs,
two shoes and a nice American goat,..

799
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:55,537
of camel hair. - Goat?
- With the hood, American.

800
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,454
Are there American goats?
- Why not?

801
00:56:59,454 --> 00:57:01,955
They brought them, from there,
now they make them here too.

802
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:04,653
The goats? - With the hood,
so if it's cold I lift it,..

803
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,135
under the main door,
and I stay hooded.

804
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,610
Ah, I got it! A duffle coat!
- Hooded goat!

805
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:14,739
Yes, the three-quarter-length ones.
- Three-quarter-length. - With frogs.

806
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,333
With frogs, right.

807
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:21,855
And the shoes. I care for,
nice new shoes. - It's the basic!

808
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:25,414
Nice, those...
- With the creak. - Eh!

809
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:29,089
Creakily, creakily, creakily...
- They give you a bearing. - Why, sure!

810
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:33,171
Have you made plans for next summer?
- I've decided:

811
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:37,375
I'm taking mommy and make a
pilgrimage to Jerusalem.

812
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:41,174
Of course. - Holy Land.
Eh, no, I'm going to Montecarlo.

813
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,297
To Montecavo.
- Montecarlo!

814
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:45,169
Montecarlo!
- Where is it?

815
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,417
In southern France, Cote d'Azur,
a wonderful place...

816
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,529
There's the casinò.

817
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,929
What's there? - Casinò!
- And you need to go to Montecarlo?

818
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,330
He goes to gamble...
- Eh, how he got it!

819
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:02,808
Who's there?
- Night guard. Who's in there?

820
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:07,612
It's me, Lo Turco.
I'm doing some overtime work.

821
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:10,533
Ah, Mr. Lo Turco,
I heard some noise. Good night.

822
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,129
Good night!

823
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,290
We've got to get to work, or
our plans for  Montecarlo..

824
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,775
and Jerusalem Delivered
will go to ruin! Work!

825
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,572
Work hard!
- Hard!

826
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:47,292
Michele. Michele. Hey, wake up.

827
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,418
Dad!
- You here?

828
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,696
And when did you arrive?
- Tonight.

829
00:59:54,860 --> 01:00:00,537
Say, the Customs and Excise officer is
at the borders, what are you doing here?

830
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:04,011
Dad, Excise officers are not only
stationed on the mountains.

831
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:08,213
They transferred me here in Rome.
- Here? At the borders of Rome?

832
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:10,934
Aren't you glad?
- Very glad, of course.

833
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:15,537
You happen to be just...
what the doctor ordered!

834
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,450
Why such a face...
- What face?

835
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:22,739
You seem upset.
- It's an optical effect.

836
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,613
You were sleeping...

837
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:27,613
If you knew, we've got so many worries!

838
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:32,456
Yes, mom told me
about the administrator,..

839
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:34,332
and that you didn't accept.

840
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,129
You did well.
You were always an honest man..

841
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:40,570
and you must be proud of that!

842
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:44,569
Sure, my son, of course, I'm honest..

843
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:49,308
and, in all modesty, I'm proud.
- But now I can give you a hand.

844
01:00:49,308 --> 01:00:51,977
No way, God forbid!
- I earn much more, you know?

845
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:56,332
I'm on duty with the flying squad.
- That is to say, at the airport?

846
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:00,732
No, flying squad, Excise Police!
- Ah, taxes!

847
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:05,018
Yes, those too, but mainly
contraband, currency traffic,..

848
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:07,648
vigilance on monopolies,
forgery...

849
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,736
False money too?
- Sure.

850
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,329
Right. Excise Police,
false money too..

851
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:18,692
is taxed. It's fair.
- It's a good career.

852
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:23,491
I can become an NCO.
- Ah, you don't say! Eh, yes...

853
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:28,328
But what are you doing, dad?
Where do you spend the nights?

854
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:32,738
Can't you see it's almost daytime?
- At night I go to the night club.

855
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,816
What?
- The night club.

856
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:41,655
To supplement the financiary income
for the house, that costs a lot!

857
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:44,573
I open the doors and they tip me
to no end.

858
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:48,779
Yes, and so you get no sleep.
- The early bird catches the worm,..

859
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:51,579
and I got to catch it.
- What's this?

860
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:55,972
No, nothing. It's the thing, you know.
How do they say it in French?

861
01:01:56,860 --> 01:02:00,940
Toilet paper! Papier hygiénique!
I won it at the lottery.

862
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:04,150
Dad, I'm sorry,
I don't want you to do such things.

863
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:07,939
The lottery with toilet paper?
- No, that you stay out at night.

864
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:12,497
Alright, it means that...
What shall I tell you? It means...

865
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:16,574
<i>What do you do?</i> You're barefoot?
Are you crazy? It's cold!

866
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:20,255
I've got my slippers under here.
- No! Blood might flow to your head!

867
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:23,372
You're a borders guard, stand high.
If you bend down, it will hurt you.

868
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:27,379
Go to bed, to bed, to bed.
- Dad, you go to sleep too, OK?

869
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,537
Hush! Right away.
Go to bed. Cover yourself!

870
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:45,612
<i>Good morning!</i> - Hi, Riccardo. At what
time did he come back last night?

871
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:47,890
Yeah, last night! This morning!
This is bad!

872
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,931
Look what he brought.
- What's in there?

873
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:52,813
What do I know? Let's open and see.
- Are you crazy?

874
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:56,535
Oh, we have some responsibility. What if
dad gets himself into some trouble?

875
01:02:56,660 --> 01:03:00,255
But why? - To begin with,
he kept this under his bed, concealed!

876
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,449
But what is in there? - I think he's
printing some terroristic stuff,..

877
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:09,030
some outlawed politics.
- Go take a walk!

878
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:13,658
Yeah, if you saw what a mess the shop is
in the morning! He works in it at night.

879
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:33,769
Stop! I'll kill you!
- Dad! - I'll kill you!

880
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:39,055
How dare you to touch this stuff?
- Yes, we did wrong.

881
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:42,968
But are you behaving well?
- Why, do I behave wrong? Not you?

882
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,091
Am I the head of this house, or not?

883
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:47,814
If one wants his children's respect,
he's got to earn it!

884
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,500
One doesn't spend his nights out,
doing who knows what.

885
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:53,169
Kids, you're becoming aggressive.

886
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:56,491
Watch out, I got heavy hands!
- But I'm saying it for your own good..

887
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:59,777
and for Riccardo as well.
You should give him a good example..

888
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,580
since he's rascal enough...- What?
He prints clandestine pamphlets..

889
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:05,655
and the rascal is me?
- What do I print?

890
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:08,653
Clandestine pamphlets.
If not, what is in that packege?

891
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:13,650
Clandestine... Clande --
And what if? Clandestine.

892
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:19,572
Masonic stuff,
hidden political committees..

893
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:23,096
the squad of the thing...
The Boldness Squad.

894
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:24,978
Listen to the "nostalgic"!

895
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,458
And you called yourself a liberal!

896
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:31,249
Reminiscences. I realized that
with the old...thing..

897
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,972
the things were good...
And the trains arrived on schedule!

898
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:42,000
And hush. Don't spread the news about
these committees. Did you understand?

899
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,529
Hail Italy!

900
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:03,254
Bye, dad. I'll see you at lunch.
- Bye.

901
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:22,649
I forgot my cigarettes. Bye.

902
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:35,695
Dad!

903
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:40,891
Dad, what are you doing?
- Nothing. I was praying.

904
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:44,490
Ah.

905
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:51,294
<i>Today I'm really absent-minded.</i>
I forgot my gloves too.

906
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:56,055
<i>Bye.</i>

907
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:09,056
Welcome back, Miche'.
- Thank you.

908
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:20,369
Michele! - Marcella!
- Hi, how are you? - Fine, and you?

909
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:23,692
My, have you changed!
- For the better or for the worse?

910
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:26,977
Not so fast! We just met
and you want me to propose already!

911
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:28,892
I didn't ask you at all.

912
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:31,295
Of course, you don't even bother
replying to my letters.

913
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:34,298
Letters? Plural?
Rather say one postcard!

914
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:37,935
3 postcards. - But I wrote you at
Christmas and you never replied.

915
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:41,132
You're right, but I knew I would come
within days, so...

916
01:06:41,260 --> 01:06:43,615
Did they discharge you?
- No, I changed unit.

917
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:46,655
Then you're leaving again?
- Are you sorry?

918
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:52,300
Now it's you who wants a proposal.
- I'm glad I met you.

919
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,850
I was sure
you didn't think about it any more.

920
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,938
About what?
- Well, about me.

921
01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:01,260
You couldn't sleep at night instead?
- No, I slept. With the dawn risings..

922
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,635
that we did, I sure slept!
- You see?

923
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,853
But I dreamed about you.

924
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:10,056
Shall we meet tonight?
- If you wish.

925
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:13,935
Well, I must run to the headquarters.
I'll look for you later. Bye ugly one!

926
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:15,288
Bye, big ugly one!

927
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:33,496
Customs and Excise Police

928
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,060
Commander Flying Squad
Marshal B. DENTI

929
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:40,496
We'll split in two teams,
sergeant Solmi and Peluso

930
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:43,812
The rest of you under cover with me.
These are the reproductions.

931
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:46,289
Look here, you are the expert.

932
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:50,611
By Jove! Much better
than those from Turin last year.

933
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:53,932
Well, those were more
a sort of soap ads.

934
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:57,177
If we find the engraver,
we'll have him hired at the Mint!

935
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:00,451
The technical bureau points out
some details. - Yes?

936
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:04,249
The squaring, the cut...
But examine them with ease.

937
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:07,450
And how many bills so far, marshal?

938
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:11,010
Seven, but maybe the big wave will
take place in the next weeks.

939
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,570
This is the list of the professionals.

940
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:16,931
Solmi, you'll take care of the small
printer shops. - Yessir.

941
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:19,620
Stop by sergeant Nocera
and get the list.

942
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:22,812
At your orders, marshal.
- Good bye. - At your orders.

943
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:25,298
We'll follow another trail.

944
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,934
You, Michele, shall go to Vetralla,
I'll explain later.

945
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:30,972
If things go well,
it will be a great blow.

946
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:34,776
What say, Bonocore?
- Yes, Mr. marshal. - Let's go.

947
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:16,820
Mr. Antonio, what's wrong?
Are you feeling sick?

948
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:19,999
No, it's nothing.
I've got a slight headache.

949
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:24,932
<i>Michele, Michele...</i>

950
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:27,614
Where are you going, Antonio?
- To Pizzigoni.

951
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:32,892
I wnat to humiliate him!
- No, Come here, listen,..

952
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:37,497
I've got good news! It's important!
- What happened? Slowly, slowly...

953
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:43,537
Listen! - Sag doch, was hat
der Marschall gesagt, Michele?

954
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:46,811
Nein, nichts zu sagen!
- Aber warum denn?

955
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:49,898
Ich bin deine Mutter, du mein Kind!
Du hast mir alles zu sagen.

956
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:54,730
Did you understand? - But who can?
These live beyond the Gothic line!

957
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:58,853
But they entrusted him
with a most important mission!

958
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:01,773
Him? In German?
- Yes. - Good!

959
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:05,330
But he won't say more!
He says that it's confidential!

960
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:08,532
Of course. He's a member of the Customs
and Excise Service.

961
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:12,255
He must keep his secrets.
He's like a self-employed person.

962
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:13,938
Good boy.
- But I'll say it to you dad,..

963
01:12:14,060 --> 01:12:16,733
because I know you won't tell anybody.
- Of course.

964
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:19,613
The fatherly complicity,
what's it for? Go on!

965
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:26,896
Why would he tell him and not us?

966
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:56,816
Who is it?
- It's me. - Ah...

967
01:12:57,260 --> 01:13:00,332
Is there mommy? - No, she went to mass.
- Thank goodness!

968
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:12,929
I came to talk to you about the money.

969
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:15,535
You want to make some more?
- You reckless!

970
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:19,569
My older son was transferred to Rome.
- I'm glad!

971
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:21,850
I don't think you'll be glad.

972
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:26,372
My son is a Customs officer
assigned to forgery repression.

973
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:29,298
And you tell me that now!?
- And when did I have to?

974
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:32,856
He was on the Alps, peaceful.
And the tragedy is not this news.

975
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:37,174
It's that they traced our false
10.000 lire bills.

976
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:43,369
Ah, my mommy!
Ah, mommy! Ah, mommy!

977
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:47,996
Cardone, don't do so. Is it possible
that each time you go in a frenzy?

978
01:13:47,996 --> 01:13:52,296
What are you, an old woman?
Don't be a child, come on.

979
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:58,496
Cheer up! Come, give me your hand.
- Why do you...? Give me your hand.

980
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:03,254
Oh my God, this has got a dead hand!
Oh my God, this has gotten rigid!

981
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,456
Cardone!
- Eh? - But what's this?

982
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:07,572
I'd blind your eyes!

983
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:11,017
What will happen now?
- What will happen, what will happen...

984
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:14,058
I've always said it!
In this country one can't do anything!

985
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:16,296
And they speak about free enterprise!

986
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:23,095
Mommy! - Come, what the hell!
They don't know yet about us.

987
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:27,891
No? - No. What's important is this:
to not spend one more penny.

988
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:33,897
Why, did you spend many?
- Of course, life needs...

989
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:41,008
I bought things that...
Obvious, no? Cardone, enough now!

990
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,068
Yes.
- There.

991
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:43,495
Enough!

992
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:48,294
Especially with new coats, enough!
Don't buy any, any more. - Yes.

993
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:51,473
One more thing,
that would be the first one,..

994
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:55,175
we must distroy the bag with
the cliches and the watermark paper.

995
01:14:55,300 --> 01:15:00,091
Yes. - Because if they find it,
it will be trouble. It's evidence.

996
01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:02,580
Have Lo Turco help you.
- I was at his place,..

997
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:05,540
I didn't find him.
He goes around showing off his shoes!

998
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:08,252
He's an exhibitionist!
- He's imprudent. - Eh, yes.

999
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:10,018
Now let's go downstairs,..

1000
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:13,816
let's take the bag and bring it
in a place I know.

1001
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:16,290
Now?
- And when, tomorrow?

1002
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,816
Why don't we wait for night to come?
- Are you crazy?

1003
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:22,618
They could be over us at any moment!
Let's go.

1004
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,400
What are you doing? No, no! God forbid!

1005
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:28,029
Wear that rag of coat you had before.
- Yes.

1006
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,932
If they see you with this
they'll notice.

1007
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:33,919
Someone like you with a coat like this..
They'll say: "That one is a forger!".

1008
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:35,758
Let's go, quick. Let's go.

1009
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:39,353
Hey there! Shht!

1010
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:42,339
But...
- Quiet!

1011
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:51,698
Did he go?
- Yes.

1012
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:54,209
Who was it?
- No one.

1013
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:39,651
Someone may come at any moment.
- Alright.

1014
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,052
Enough, enough.

1015
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,409
Cover, cover.

1016
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,940
Dad!
- Who's that? Hey!

1017
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,149
What are you doing there?

1018
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,899
What? You see? Nothing.
- Nothing.

1019
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:11,280
You rather, why are you here?
- Just a walk. But what are you burying?

1020
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:16,334
Nothing. We buried...yes.
What are we burying? You want to know?

1021
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:20,414
What? A carrion!
What could we bury? A carrion!

1022
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:22,414
<i>A carrion?</i>
- No, not him!

1023
01:17:22,714 --> 01:17:23,714
But what're you saying?

1024
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,754
Poor pet, he went under a car.
- Eh!

1025
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:27,850
A running over.
- Yes, yes. - A dog?

1026
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:31,691
A dog? Yes, a dog. Now I remember,
a dog. - A dog.

1027
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:34,574
And whose dog was it?
- Yours, Mustafà!

1028
01:17:34,740 --> 01:17:38,369
Mustafà? Mustafà died?
- No. - Yes. - Eh.

1029
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:41,418
I didn't want to tell him.
Michele will be sorry... Mustafà!

1030
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:44,490
Oh, poor dog, I'm so sorry.

1031
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:01,735
I'd like to know why you said Mustafà!

1032
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:04,458
Don't mortify me, I was confused,
didn't know what to say.

1033
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:07,936
How? One must think, reflect before
speaking, no!

1034
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:11,133
Tonight, when my son gets back home
and sees the dog..

1035
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:13,814
he'll want to know
what we were burying..

1036
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:17,530
and why we lied.
And evrything will come out!

1037
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:18,933
Hold the dog.

1038
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:23,691
This is the kind of things that prevents
the perfect crime, dear Cardone.

1039
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:30,177
What, are you going to kill him here?
- Where else, at the slaughterhouse?

1040
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:34,738
I don't have the heart to look.
- How, you don't have the heart? - No.

1041
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:38,819
And me neither, but I'm justified,
I'm the owner of the dog.

1042
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:41,500
<i>It takes someone who looks,
or else, who's going to do it?</i>

1043
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:44,817
So then, now you take him,
open his arms..

1044
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:46,618
and I, with one stroke..

1045
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:49,971
will go straight to the heart, come!

1046
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:53,732
<i>Look, as if he begged!
I can't!</i>

1047
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:56,693
I can't. - Look!
- As if he prayed.

1048
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:00,773
<i>He is praying.</i> He's begging for mercy.

1049
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:03,255
How cute!
- And how're we going to do now?

1050
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:07,254
I don't have the guts anymore.
You and the dog just discouraged me.

1051
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:11,018
<i>You discouraged me.
Nothing, I won't kill him anymore.</i>

1052
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:14,179
How shall we do?
Now...I got an idea! - Eh!

1053
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:17,896
Now we'll tie him to a stone,
here on the route there are many,..

1054
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:21,969
to an Milan stone.
- A stone...what?

1055
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:25,172
The Milan stones! - What? - What
country are you from? - What are they?

1056
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:28,576
How, what are they? Along the road
there are those stones with numbers...

1057
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:31,851
Don Anto', the milestone!
- Alright, same thing.

1058
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:33,652
There is one. Let's tie him there.

1059
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,331
The weapon, I'll throw it away.
- Yes, yes.

1060
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:41,975
Surely, some good soul
will pass by and take him.

1061
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:44,694
After all, this is a nice dog.
It's a St. Bernard!

1062
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:47,254
It's a St. Bernard?
- Maybe a cross-breed...but St. Bernard.

1063
01:19:47,380 --> 01:19:49,735
You had a great idea.
- Yes. So then, let's go.

1064
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:51,458
Nobody saw us.

1065
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,570
So long, Mustafà!
Good luck.

1066
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:56,573
Good luck!

1067
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:05,614
Good work, sergeant!
- Thanks, good luck!

1068
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:09,335
Good luck for Vetralla!
- Good luck to you too! - Thank you.

1069
01:20:56,140 --> 01:21:02,090
I'd have him arrested. - What a rip-off!
- Some prices! 7.000, 8.000, 9.000!

1070
01:21:02,260 --> 01:21:05,616
The 8.500 ones I saw them at Macerata
for 5.000, identical!

1071
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:40,895
Eh! What's happening?
- Where have you been?

1072
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:44,490
I looked for you for three days: you
were not at home, the shop is closed...

1073
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:47,771
The printer's has become
a marginal business. - Oh, is it so?

1074
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:49,811
Didn't you buy the new suit?

1075
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:53,216
New suit? In a few days
they'll give us a striped new suit.

1076
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:55,092
A pyjamas?
- A pyjamas, sure!

1077
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:58,496
The anti-forgery police is after us.
We're hunted.

1078
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:02,490
<i>My son told me that a squad</i>
is checking the tobacco stores.

1079
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:05,737
Ah, that was the first banknote
that you passed off!

1080
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:09,614
Oh, yes? I passed it off? But who made
me the boss? Who elected me?

1081
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:11,335
Quiet!

1082
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:14,818
Who elected me as Representative?
You! The people!

1083
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:16,818
It's true, Honorable.

1084
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:23,089
At the House will you hold a speech
on the subject? - Certainly!

1085
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:26,974
I want to come to the Chamber too. <i>Yes,
I shall take you with me to the Chamber.</i>

1086
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:29,330
We shall go together
to a nice detention-room.

1087
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:32,532
You are crazy. What do I care? After all
they're looking for you, not for me.

1088
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:34,252
In fact, let's do this way:
starting today..

1089
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:38,009
when we meet, don't greet me.
Let's avoid each other.

1090
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:40,415
Good morning, good night and over.
- Yes.

1091
01:22:59,220 --> 01:23:02,098
Maybe it's closed for mourning.
- Usually they put a sign.

1092
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:05,493
Let's continue our round.
We'll return later, or tomorrow.

1093
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:08,860
Who's next?
- There are still seven.

1094
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:12,858
Printer's Durantini,
in via delle Orsoline.

1095
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:15,056
Alright, let's go.
- Yessir.

1096
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:22,208
After all,..

1097
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:27,810
thinking it over, you're not wrong, you
know? As you said, avoid each other.

1098
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:32,857
When we meet, good morning, good night
and over. - But...

1099
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:41,256
<i>Janitor!</i>

1100
01:23:42,620 --> 01:23:45,354
<i>Who is it?</i> - Good morning. I'm looking
for Michele Bonocore.

1101
01:23:45,454 --> 01:23:46,754
Michele Bonocore is my son.

1102
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:50,300
Pleased to meet you. I'm marshal Denti.
- By Jove, you're the boss!

1103
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:52,990
Excuse me. I meant to say,
you're the marshal.

1104
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:54,592
Come in. Come down.
- Thank you.

1105
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:56,611
How can I help you?
- Is Michele in?

1106
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,274
No, he just left.
A drop of liqueur?

1107
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:01,689
No, thank you.
- You must take it. Mom!

1108
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:04,893
What's up? - A glass of liqueur
to the marshal.

1109
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:08,695
<i>Finished?</i> But how, a bottle bought
three months ago is finished already?

1110
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:12,329
I apologize.

1111
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:14,928
In this house liqueur goes
like fresh water.

1112
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:18,177
If you'd come yesterday, you would have
found the liqueur. - Don't worry.

1113
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:21,173
I had been nearby and so I thought...

1114
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:25,852
I wanted some news on a certain thing,
but it doesn't matter.

1115
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:28,773
You didn't have luck, eh?

1116
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:31,490
What?
- A certain thing...

1117
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:33,168
Vetralla!

1118
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:37,211
But how do you know it?
- How do I know it? But, marshall,..

1119
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:39,450
I'm the father,
he's the son...

1120
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:41,457
Hi dad.
- Good morning, dad. - Hi!

1121
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:44,572
What's for lunch, grandma?
- You know I got an 8 in Italian?

1122
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:45,416
Good!

1123
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:48,213
I'll go, I've got much to do.
- Good bye, marshal.

1124
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:51,776
Listen, marshal,
don't consider me "curious".

1125
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:57,491
You know, as father of an officer...
How far have you got? - Far enough.

1126
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:02,169
See, at times an insignificant clue is
enough, just one banknote.

1127
01:25:03,340 --> 01:25:05,092
You know what I mean?

1128
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:07,615
One bill passed off in a tobacco store.

1129
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:11,650
As smart as they might be,
these people always make mistakes..

1130
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:14,931
and sooner or later we catch'em all.
- You catch them, eh?

1131
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:27,697
Mustafà!
- Is it yours? - No.

1132
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:31,013
Well then, I'm going.
- If you don't mind, I'll escort you.

1133
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,291
<i>Antonio!</i>
- What's up?

1134
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:39,214
Mustafà is back!
- It's not Mustafà. It's a double.

1135
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:42,731
We all have a double in our lives.
That one is Mustafà's double.

1136
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:45,932
But he's greeting us joyfully!
- So what, all dogs do.

1137
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:48,648
The dog is a man's friend,
the dog is smart.

1138
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:52,455
He happened to know there was
a vacant dog place and so he came.

1139
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:54,536
Call him stupid!

1140
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:57,453
I'd like to know what you buried
among the ruins.

1141
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:01,175
We'll go there, we'll pull it out and
we'll see. - And I'll break your head!

1142
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,018
Let sleeping dogs lie!

1143
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:04,573
Poor beast, he's lying in peace.

1144
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:07,692
Marshal! I swear, that is not Mustafà.
- I believe it.

1145
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:10,175
If it were Mustaà,
I would tell you, no?

1146
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:12,732
Didn't you see how disagreeable he was?

1147
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:15,897
Dirty, hairy, hair on his eyes...
Ugly!

1148
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:20,213
Mustafà? But Mustafà is a wonderful
dog, olympic!

1149
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:24,253
Ah. - Yes. Not to brag about it, but
even though you're a marshal,..

1150
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:27,531
he would have done what he liked
with you. I'm telling you.

1151
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:30,538
This one looks like him, but he's not.
- Yes, I understand.

1152
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:33,857
We too are looking for bills that
look like the good ones..

1153
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:36,414
but are not good.

1154
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:38,929
Goodbye, Mr. Bonocore.
- Goodbye,..

1155
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:40,413
take care.
- See you soon.

1156
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:42,212
When?
- Soon.

1157
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:58,733
Soon.

1158
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:04,138
Eh, yes.
Eh, yes, I must.

1159
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:13,219
Good morning, Mr. Antonio.
Is Michele back?

1160
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:16,533
Michele? Yes, no, that is
he came back and then left again.

1161
01:27:16,533 --> 01:27:18,249
Do you know how it went?

1162
01:27:18,249 --> 01:27:20,936
Why do they all ask me how it went
to Michele? I'll say...

1163
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:23,528
Why, didn't he tell you anything?
- No, what about?

1164
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:27,060
But, about us. - Dear girl,
I've got so many things on my mind.

1165
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:28,539
And what should he have told me?

1166
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:32,937
That we love each other.
- Ah! - That's all.

1167
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:37,655
Is that all? And it's a cinch to you?
I bet you two want to marry, no?

1168
01:27:37,655 --> 01:27:39,660
Why, are you against it?
- No, God forbid.

1169
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:42,570
Of course, in due time.

1170
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:46,000
Tell me, is daddy at home?
- What?

1171
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,100
I say, tell me, daddy, dad,
is he upstairs, at home?

1172
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:51,470
Ah, yes. Are you going to tell him?
- I will.

1173
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:54,891
Thank you, Mr. Antonio.
- You're welcome. - Dad is so sullen!

1174
01:27:54,940 --> 01:27:59,990
Go, he was about to shave. - Really?
I'm going to help him shave upwards.

1175
01:28:27,020 --> 01:28:29,250
Who is it?

1176
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:34,176
Oh, so sorry, wrong house.

1177
01:28:45,420 --> 01:28:46,375
It is here!

1178
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:54,672
Excuse me, I'd like to speak
with mister Lo Turco.

1179
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:55,695
He's not in.

1180
01:28:56,660 --> 01:28:57,934
And who are you?

1181
01:28:58,060 --> 01:28:59,334
Why, don't you know me?

1182
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:01,690
Actually, it's the first time
I meet you.

1183
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:05,211
Rather, who are you?
- That's a good one! I'm the janitor.

1184
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:09,055
Lo Turco's janitor?
- Lo Turco's and all the other tenants'.

1185
01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:12,058
And you don't know Lo Turco?
- Sure I know him.

1186
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:14,735
And who is this?
- By Jove! Lo Turco!

1187
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:16,737
And this?
- Really...

1188
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:19,568
Don't make me laugh, Lo Turco.
- Am I funny?

1189
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:23,295
To begin with, you didn't recognize me.
- Of course, you looked like a monkey.

1190
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:24,455
Who's that?
- Well?

1191
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:28,575
Did you look at yourself in the mirror
how ridiculous you are?

1192
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:31,578
Caution is caution.
- What caution and caution!

1193
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,737
What's there? Lo Tu'...
- What? - Lo Tu'...

1194
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:39,338
Don't touch me.
- I say, are we alone? - Alone.

1195
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:41,013
Are you sure?
- Sure.

1196
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:46,009
Those ones...are downstairs.
- Oh, mamma mia. I'll put on my make-up.

1197
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:48,370
What make-up?
Who do you want to fool?

1198
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,536
And then, set your mind at rest.
- Why?

1199
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:54,451
They're not looking for you,
but me.

1200
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:58,615
Then put some make-up on.
- Take this thing out of my mouth!

1201
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:01,459
It's clean, don Antonio.
- Clean my foot! It's filthy.

1202
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:04,777
It's horsehair. - Maybe
hair of people with death sentence.

1203
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,937
What death sentence! It's horsehair.
- All the hairs in my mouth!

1204
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:11,450
But... Don Antonio!
But did they report you?

1205
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:14,458
What report!
Come here.

1206
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:16,658
These hairs in my mouth!

1207
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:22,373
I dont know...I dont know how
they managed to find out..

1208
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,650
that the tobacco store one is me.

1209
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:26,378
There isn't any. And how?

1210
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:29,651
And how? The marshal came to my place
with an excuse.

1211
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:33,216
What a fox!
Ah, what a fox that marshal!

1212
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:36,813
He started to play with this poor soul..

1213
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:39,010
like the cat does with the mouse.

1214
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:43,014
And on top of that, guess who came in
at a certain moment?

1215
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:46,217
Who? - The dog.
- Mustafà? - Mustafà.

1216
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:49,016
Then they say that
a dog is man's best friend!

1217
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:51,131
Ih, I'd kill him!

1218
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:54,332
The dog, if he actually were my friend,
wouldn't have come right then..

1219
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:56,690
to ruin my plans.
Is that clear?

1220
01:30:56,820 --> 01:31:01,450
But he's a guard dog.
And a guard dog with the guards...

1221
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:07,617
There isn't any. Don Antonio, excuse me,
but, among foxes, dogs. cats, mouses..

1222
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:10,013
I didn't understand anything.
Explain yourself well, will you?

1223
01:31:10,180 --> 01:31:11,499
The marshal..

1224
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:13,013
knows everything.

1225
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:17,089
Then I... - Take off this beard!
Who do you think you're frightening?

1226
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:19,178
There isn't any.
- Ah, right.

1227
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:20,853
The marshal knows everything.

1228
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:23,495
And any minute now they might arrest me.

1229
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:27,017
And Michele, that poor son of mine,
is ruined. Eh, of course,..

1230
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:30,331
son of a forger, you know...
They'll kick him out of the corps.

1231
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:35,256
The marshal 'lo buggero' (I trick him).
- A friend of yours? - Who?

1232
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:37,975
Lo Bugero?
- And who is this 'Lo Bugero'?

1233
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:40,375
You said:
"The marshal 'lo buggero'".

1234
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:42,456
You misunderstood.

1235
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,568
I meant:
I, the marshal, will trick him.

1236
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:49,249
Ah! And how?
- I'll give myself up. - Ah.

1237
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:52,692
You'll give yourself up
and will trick the marshal? - Eh.

1238
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:56,457
Do you know that if you give yourself up
they arrest you all the same?

1239
01:31:56,580 --> 01:32:00,095
I know, but this is the great idea!
- That is to say?

1240
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:03,615
I'll have myself arrested by my son.

1241
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:08,011
Of course, a guard who arrests
his own father is a golden guard.

1242
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:11,018
No only they won't kick him out,
but they'll promote him.

1243
01:32:11,940 --> 01:32:15,615
Is it clear? Everything shall be set,
your daughter too.

1244
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:19,140
What's my daughter got to do with this?
- How, what she's got to do?

1245
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:22,016
You didn't understand anything?

1246
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:24,932
Those two kids..

1247
01:32:26,060 --> 01:32:27,334
are in love.

1248
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:32,057
I had a hunch, but...
Is it a serious matter, Bonocore?

1249
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:35,455
Yes, very.
- Well...

1250
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:39,536
Have you got something against?
- No. I'm not amazed.

1251
01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:43,130
He's a good boy. And you?
- I have nothing to argue.

1252
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:45,450
Your daughter is a good girl.

1253
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:50,649
If I sacrifice myself, it is
for their good. And by now,..

1254
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:52,773
Mr. Turchetti...

1255
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:58,173
Is it possible
that you haven't learned my name yet?

1256
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:01,491
Lo Turco. Lo Turco.
- Mr. Turco,..

1257
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:05,295
also for the relationship, because you'd
come to be my relative.

1258
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:08,691
But what kind of relative would you be
to me? - How, what would I be to you?

1259
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:11,618
But then you're really ignorant,
pardon my saying so,..

1260
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:15,210
in matter of affinities.
<i>Alright, but what relative woul I be?</i>

1261
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:19,812
A co-parent-in-law. - Well, but I'd be
related to a co-parent-in-law-in-jail.

1262
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:21,811
Let's tell it like it is, Bonocore.

1263
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:24,210
And thank God
that you'll stay out of it.

1264
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:27,816
It's better for you as well as for me.
Yes, the co-parent-in-law who's outside..

1265
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:31,859
can bring the co-parent-in-law who's
inside, say, some cigarettes,..

1266
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:35,252
oranges, cookies, candies, chocolate...

1267
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:39,129
I recommend you, at Christmas,
some nougat. I'm greedy.

1268
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:44,658
Greedy, greedy...
I don't have private means.

1269
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:47,093
By the way,..

1270
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:50,891
that money, did you spend it all?
- Not all.

1271
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:54,938
Then do this:
the remainder, destroy it.

1272
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:57,098
And Cardone must do so as well.

1273
01:33:57,220 --> 01:33:59,575
In fact, he even knows where the bag
with the cliches is. - Yes.

1274
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:02,777
One last favor I ask you.
On the terrace,..

1275
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:06,210
in the fourth water tank, there's my
loot. Destroy that too.

1276
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,729
Then we destroy everything, Bonocore?
- Everything.

1277
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:10,452
It's better.
- It's better. - Thank you.

1278
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:11,774
Who is it? Who is it?

1279
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:13,652
Don't do that, you scare me.

1280
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:16,738
Why do you get scared
if you're giving yourself up?

1281
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,816
That's true.
I'm going, eh.

1282
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:41,532
Who provided the material?
- I did. - Ah.

1283
01:34:41,980 --> 01:34:45,256
And who helped you with the clichés?
They're better than those 3 years ago.

1284
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:47,689
Nobody. I made some progress, marshal.
- Ah.

1285
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:51,529
How many did you print?
- Who knows? 400, 500...

1286
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:54,298
Well, come and sign.

1287
01:34:54,420 --> 01:34:57,810
At least, this time you didn't
make us waste time. Good boys.

1288
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:01,932
That's it, sign here.

1289
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:07,491
There's your father. He asked for you.
- One moment.

1290
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:14,216
Sergeant, check these reports, please.
- Alright

1291
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:17,531
And you did not believe it, see?
Good job! Thanks to you!

1292
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:19,489
Come.

1293
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:24,336
Wait. I wish to speak to my son, not
with the commander.

1294
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:25,415
Dad!
- Ah, well.

1295
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:28,293
Excuse me a minute, marshal!
What happened?

1296
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:33,615
I need to speak to you privately.
- Is it something serious? - Very.

1297
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:37,255
Your dad must make
a serious confession,..

1298
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:40,929
in fact, don't interrupt me, please.
If it weren't for your career,..

1299
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:44,530
I wouldn't have come here. - But what
is it all about? - It's about..

1300
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:47,540
some 10.000 lire bills, the fake ones.

1301
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:51,053
And what's that got to do with you?
- It's got, it's got, it's got!

1302
01:35:51,220 --> 01:35:54,371
Ask the marshal!
Come, don't waste time, arrest me.

1303
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:57,378
Or else he will and you're tricked.
The forger..

1304
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:01,890
it's me. - Say, dad, you didn't come
all the way here just to joke?

1305
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:06,770
Joke? Come, obey your dad, handcuff me.
You got them?

1306
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:09,295
What handcuffs?
- They don'd give you handcuffs?

1307
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:11,052
They send you around without handcuffs!

1308
01:36:11,180 --> 01:36:12,693
I don't know
what this world has come to.

1309
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:16,893
The one who passed off the forged 10.000
to the tobacco store..

1310
01:36:17,820 --> 01:36:21,495
is me. - Bonocore!
- Eh, no! It's him who arrested me!

1311
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:26,657
Ah, yes? Well, well, about time!
- Dad always jokes.

1312
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:30,216
He came for a visit. - I bet he wanted
news about the investigation.

1313
01:36:30,340 --> 01:36:32,934
Did you tell him?
- I didn't know if I could.

1314
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:34,095
Why not? By now!

1315
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:36,859
Martelli called,
they got the printer too.

1316
01:36:36,980 --> 01:36:40,052
Lo Turco? - No, the Swiss.
- Then he gave a false name!

1317
01:36:40,180 --> 01:36:43,058
Who? - Nothing...
- Repeater. For the third time!

1318
01:36:43,180 --> 01:36:45,853
The Swiss? - They call him so,
but he's from Bergamo.

1319
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:48,972
A smart guy!
The bills were very well reproduced!

1320
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:51,933
What do you say,
shall we reward the boy?

1321
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:55,058
Eh, yes, he deserved it.
- Do you know he was quite discouraged?

1322
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:57,734
He did
an excellent job at Vetralla instead.

1323
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:01,496
Didn't I tell you that at times an
insignificant clue is enough?

1324
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:04,737
It seemed so insignificant to your son
thet he didn't believe it.

1325
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:07,772
But these forgers...
- All arrested.

1326
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:11,251
And me? - What?
- No, I thought instead...

1327
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:16,375
This the report's draft.
Check if everything is okay.

1328
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:19,088
Dad!
- Mr. Bonocore, so long.

1329
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:22,416
<i>Marshal, so long forever!</i>

1330
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:24,929
You, hurry up
they're expecting us at the Ministry.

1331
01:37:25,060 --> 01:37:26,539
Alright, coming right on.

1332
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:31,009
Well, things standing this way,
I'll see you at home.

1333
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:33,734
Wait a moment.
Tell me, how did you know..

1334
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:37,216
that the bill was fake?
- Easy, one asks:

1335
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:42,010
"How did you know..."
And here's the answer. Since..

1336
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:46,455
I unfortunately have little familiarity
with 10.000 lire bills,..

1337
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:49,458
I happened to have that one in my hands.
And what did I say?

1338
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:53,016
This bill, I looked at it,
I saw a strange aspect,..

1339
01:37:53,780 --> 01:37:57,534
a little suspicious, and I thought:
"I'll take it to the tobacco store".

1340
01:37:57,660 --> 01:37:59,935
"If they accept it,
it means it's good".

1341
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:03,934
Instead, it was fake. Here it is.
- Look who's here!

1342
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:08,371
Look who's here!

1343
01:38:08,540 --> 01:38:13,091
Say the truth, it's a good imitation!
- Not so much. - Modestly...

1344
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:17,089
But who gave it to you? - By Jove!
But there's the cross mark here.

1345
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:20,816
What cross mark? - Then it's not
the one... it's the other one that...

1346
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:23,215
Pizzigoni gave it to me!
- What's Pizzigoni got to do with it?

1347
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:26,019
I brought him the watch,
he gave me the hock...

1348
01:38:26,180 --> 01:38:30,139
He thinged me the thing...
The he's a forger too.

1349
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:33,093
Did you arrest Pizzigoni?
You must arrest Pizzigoni!

1350
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:35,688
It probably fell into his hands
as it did into yours.

1351
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:38,334
Eh, no. I'd arrest him, Pizzigoni.
- Dad!

1352
01:38:56,820 --> 01:38:59,050
Don Anto', explain me well:

1353
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:02,969
you, after all, passed off only one
of those bills,..

1354
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:05,660
the one in that evening?
- One only. And I made a mistake.

1355
01:39:05,780 --> 01:39:08,374
Because I passed off the one that
Pizzigoni had given me,..

1356
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:11,572
which was false, in its turn.

1357
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:14,971
It's the truth! I didn't have the guts
to spend the other one.

1358
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:17,574
We're safe then!
Anto', we're safe!

1359
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:20,095
Slow with this euphoria,
it's out of place!

1360
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:22,415
There are the other bills around,
yours.

1361
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,895
You bought the shoes with the squeak,..

1362
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:28,490
he bought the new coat.
- But what squeak! God forbid!

1363
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:30,417
The money, I borrowed it..

1364
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:32,496
from my godfather from
Santa Maria Capua Vetere.

1365
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:35,134
I was there for a couple of days,
that's why I wasn't at home.

1366
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:38,093
You're lying!
- I didn't pass off one bill.

1367
01:39:38,220 --> 01:39:40,893
Yes, you! But him?
- No, I didn't pass off anything.

1368
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:44,615
I bought the coat with the savings
mommy kept under the mattress!

1369
01:39:44,740 --> 01:39:45,377
I understand.

1370
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:49,374
Each one of us didn't want to appear
too honest to the others.

1371
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:50,979
It's true.
- It's clear.

1372
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:56,049
Listen, as a band of forgers
we're really the pits, eh!

1373
01:39:56,420 --> 01:39:59,696
Alright, but as gentlemen
we're integer.

1374
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:01,173
Ah, yes, this yes.

1375
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:03,615
Look into my eyes.
- What happened?

1376
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:05,532
Are you game for a bonfire?
- Eh?

1377
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:07,770
For a bonfire?
- No, I just ate,..

1378
01:40:07,900 --> 01:40:10,892
how can I put a bonfire on my stomach?
- What have you understood? A bonfire..

1379
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:12,612
of flames!
- Ah, a bonfire of fire!

1380
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:14,890
What else, of water?
-Who shall make it?

1381
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:17,659
It will make... - Will you let me speak?
- Where shall we make it?

1382
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:21,176
We'll make it there. Where the bag is
buried. Let's burn everything!

1383
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:23,860
Eh! - Do we burn everything?
Great idea! Let's go!

1384
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:43,699
Everybody freeze!

1385
01:40:43,820 --> 01:40:48,177
In the euphoria I threw away
my salary! The salary!
