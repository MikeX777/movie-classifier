I hit him once and they fired me.

- Look who's talking!

Poor fellow.

43
00:05:48,904 --> 00:05:51,516
It was the syphilis. He's
like an innocent child.

44
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:53,905
Syphilis? I heard
he had encephalitis.

45
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:56,640
- No, it was syphilis.
- Encephilitis, I tell you.

46
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,996
A mosquito bite made
him turn into an idiot.

47
00:05:59,116 --> 00:06:01,677
Rubbish. He inherited
his parent's syphilis.

48
00:06:01,797 --> 00:06:03,966
You know it was encephalitis, right?

49
00:06:04,086 --> 00:06:08,195
I heard he hit his head when
he fell down the stairs as a baby.

That's a fine model gun.

79

It shoots bullets.

80
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:55,184
- Right, plastic bullets.
- Real bullets!

81
00:13:05,821 --> 00:13:07,215
So, it really shoots?

82
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:08,534
Just watch me.

91

This is the best part of the

93
00:13:46,883 --> 00:13:48,474
It really shoots bullets.

00:13:49,436 --> 00:13:51,434
Seems like the work of Fujimoto.

95
00:13:54,998 --> 00:13:56,885
Isn't Fujimoto with the army?

96
00:13:57,193 --> 00:14:00,029
I heard he quit a month ago.

97
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:03,978
Fujimoto could really do such a thing.

98
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:06,310
He's crazy about that stuff.

99
00:14:10,377 --> 00:14:11,549

00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:22,447

- Really?

131
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,174
I don't want a drink.

Everyone is dead.

137
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,221

So, you’re still
one of the bad boys...

00:17:14,295 --> 00:17:16,626
They let you out
quicker than I thought.

142
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:20,980
- That's all I got.
- Fair enough.

143
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:25,222

At least bring us some sugar!

00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:33,564
About that...

146
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:37,828
I’m too old to
go on playing around.

147
00:17:38,376 --> 00:17:40,646
Maybe it's the right
time for a quieter life.

148
00:17:40,905 --> 00:17:42,199
You want a job?

149
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:47,279
I thought I’d rest up
for a few days...

150
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,841
and then think
about everything.

151
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:51,715
Eat as much as you like.

152
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:58,217

153
00:17:58,337 --> 00:18:00,005
We should have some fun.

154
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:02,840
Go out for some

155
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,599

156
00:18:05,957 --> 00:18:07,240
I'll retire.

00:18:08,276 --> 00:18:11,309
Don't say that. We’re
friends, I’ll miss you!

158
00:18:15,322 --> 00:18:16,642
I'm so exhausted.

159
00:18:20,243 --> 00:18:23,129
You’re just
having the prison blues.

160
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:29,693
We'll call Kobayashi and
celebrate your release tonight.

161
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:34,071
We’ll drink together and
you’ll feel better soon.

162
00:18:34,357 --> 00:18:38,067
How did a stupid guy
like you ever even find a job?

163
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,832
I went to high school,
different than you...

164
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:43,501
What are you talking about?

165
00:18:44,392 --> 00:18:47,075
We went to high school
together, right, Oshan?

166
00:18:47,857 --> 00:18:50,385
You dropped out of
junior high, didn't you?

167
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,370
See how stupid they became
while you were away, Oshan...

168
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,308
You’re such an idiot!

169
00:18:56,928 --> 00:19:00,198
Oshan, we really had fun
in junior high, didn't we?

170
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:05,932
You just came to sit
in the back row all the time.

171
00:19:06,052 --> 00:19:09,883
What the...? You wouldn't have
managed without Oshan's help, either!

172
00:19:11,803 --> 00:19:12,778
Yazawa!

175
00:19:18,693 --> 00:19:19,880
Where are you?

176
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:24,942
Where did that gangster go...

177
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:45,250
(Japanese anthem starts playing.)

178
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,213
I am good for nothing...

179
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,507
Junior high was just great.

180
00:21:04,235 --> 00:21:06,590
You never saw Oshan as the
leader back in the day.

181
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,483
You just stood there
wetting your pants.

182
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:12,098
That wasn't me, idiot!

183
00:21:12,218 --> 00:21:14,124
You remember, don't you, Oshan?

184
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,506
Don't say that. That's a
thing of the past now.

185
00:21:22,626 --> 00:21:25,296
But Oshan, there’s
still so much we could do.

186
00:21:25,611 --> 00:21:30,495
Just think of those punks who get
scared just from hearing your name.

187
00:21:33,162 --> 00:21:34,112
Welcome!

188
00:21:35,271 --> 00:21:37,232
Good that you’re back, Oshan!

189
00:21:46,325 --> 00:21:47,792
May I take your order?

190
00:21:50,037 --> 00:21:51,443
What would you like?

191
00:21:51,828 --> 00:21:53,800
- Sake.
- OK.

192
00:22:03,993 --> 00:22:06,817
Come on, boys!
Let's get drunk!

193
00:22:08,112 --> 00:22:09,900
Are you drinking, Kobayashi?

194
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,064
Let's drink to Oshan's release.

195
00:22:13,184 --> 00:22:15,082
Bottoms up, Oshan!

196
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:17,462
Drink with us, Oshan!

197
00:22:34,949 --> 00:22:36,083
Your bill, Sir.

198
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,940
Thank you for your visit.

199
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:48,867
What a bastard.

200
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,218
What a fucking bastard!

201
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:57,853
Why did you stop me, Oshan?

202
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:03,575
Hope they won't cause more trouble.

203
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:08,394
Did that guy expect that
Oshan would waste his time on him?

204
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:10,515
But he really pissed me off.

205
00:23:10,635 --> 00:23:12,034
Bill, please!

206
00:23:16,756 --> 00:23:18,174
Bastard!

207
00:23:28,412 --> 00:23:30,808
- Stupid bastards...
- They must be kidding.

208
00:23:53,831 --> 00:23:55,361
Long time no see, Oki!

209
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:58,752
Kind of bad timing, eh?

210
00:24:00,824 --> 00:24:03,655
Want to settle that
dispute we had three years ago?

211
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:05,363
You...!

212
00:24:16,273 --> 00:24:19,140
I beg you.
Please forget it.

213
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,835
I won't let you get away!

214
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,106
Let's run!

215
00:24:41,282 --> 00:24:42,206
Are you okay?

216
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:46,005
- What was that?
- The model gun.

217
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:50,745
Just a bit more, hurry up.

218
00:24:58,343 --> 00:25:00,230
Too late. He's dead.

219
00:25:00,254 --> 00:25:02,683
- Report to the HQ.
- Yes.

220
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:06,174
<i>Son of the leader of the
Tenryu Gang murdered</i>

221
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:11,367
The eldest son of Yamaoka Daigo,
the leader of the Tenryu Gang,

222
00:25:11,713 --> 00:25:14,537
the 22-year-old Yamaoka Ryuichiro,

223
00:25:14,657 --> 00:25:17,374
was attacked last
night at around 11:40...

224
00:25:17,494 --> 00:25:20,889
in the Higashi district
of Fukuoka city.

225
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:24,839
He was discovered dead.
He had been shot in the leg.

226
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:28,391
When the police arrived,
Yamaoka had already bled to death.

227
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:33,990
Gang leader Yamaoka told journalists
who inquired about his son’s death:

228
00:25:34,071 --> 00:25:38,309
"We'll blow out the lights
of those guys who killed my son."

229
00:25:38,351 --> 00:25:41,693
He added that he would not
rely on the police's investigations.

230
00:25:41,813 --> 00:25:47,243
Authorities fear that this incident
might lead to a violent gang war,

231
00:25:47,578 --> 00:25:53,367
therefore the police are not treating
this case as a normal murder.

232
00:25:53,487 --> 00:25:59,061
Investigations will continue while
securing the safety of the public...

233
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:20,975
<i>It'll be 200,000 per person.</i>

234
00:26:21,985 --> 00:26:23,274
<i>When do we depart?</i>

235
00:26:23,946 --> 00:26:26,425
<i>The sooner the better...</i>

236
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:29,298
<i>There's a ship leaving
Hakata port in three days.</i>

237
00:26:29,418 --> 00:26:31,506
<i>Phone me again tomorrow.</i>

238
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,304
<i>I'll give you the details then.</i>

239
00:26:34,424 --> 00:26:36,388
<i>Have the money
ready when you leave.</i>

240
00:26:36,508 --> 00:26:38,663
<i>Pay the full price
before departure.</i>

241
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:40,668
<i>Understood.</i>

242
00:26:41,595 --> 00:26:46,318
<i>Police are looking for two suspects
in the murder of Yamaoka Ryuichiro.</i>

243
00:26:46,781 --> 00:26:50,849
<i>Yazawa Masaaki, 21 years old.
Unemployed, no fixed abode.</i>

244
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:55,441
<i>Kaneda Chuji, 20 years old.
Unemployed, no fixed abode.</i>

245
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:57,805
<i>Authorities are on
alert all over the country.</i>

246
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,818
You think we’re safe here?

247
00:27:03,938 --> 00:27:06,075
This place should be fine.

248
00:27:06,195 --> 00:27:08,184
But you should stay inside.

249
00:27:31,632 --> 00:27:34,838
- You are Fujimoto Manji, right?
- Yeah.

250
00:27:35,134 --> 00:27:36,824
Is your big brother here?

251
00:27:38,168 --> 00:27:39,821
Would you call him for us?

252
00:27:41,091 --> 00:27:42,244
Big brother!

253
00:27:43,466 --> 00:27:45,375
Your friends are here.

254
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,863
Big brother!

255
00:27:53,111 --> 00:27:55,032
Your friends are here.

256
00:28:24,971 --> 00:28:26,174
Big brother?

257
00:28:26,294 --> 00:28:28,245
Your friends are here.

258
00:28:52,693 --> 00:28:53,635
Over there.

259
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:58,334
Turn left here.

260
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,086
Right there.

261
00:29:43,561 --> 00:29:44,813
Stop!

262
00:29:45,198 --> 00:29:47,541
Robbers! Robbers!

263
00:30:01,921 --> 00:30:03,483
Lose him!

264
00:30:19,504 --> 00:30:21,326
We did it!

265
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,322
I knew we could.

266
00:30:24,342 --> 00:30:25,804
That was perfect!

267
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,974
That's how I do such things.

268
00:30:28,094 --> 00:30:30,106
I know how to do it.

269
00:31:23,037 --> 00:31:26,979
<i>We interrupt our program
for some breaking news:</i>

270
00:31:27,797 --> 00:31:32,118
<i>20 minutes ago, a robbery occurred
in Maeda, in the Higashi ward.</i>

271
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:36,395
<i>Two armed men entered a branch
of the Hakata Kiyo Bank.</i>

272
00:31:36,515 --> 00:31:41,989
<i>They got hold of around 2.3 million
in cash and fled towards Yoshizuka.</i>

273
00:31:42,456 --> 00:31:48,183
<i>The two young men threatened the
staff with a shotgun and a knife.</i>

274
00:31:48,303 --> 00:31:52,324
<i>They grabbed the money on the
counter and drove off in their car.</i>

275
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:54,516
We were looking for you, punk!

276
00:31:57,577 --> 00:31:59,474
Take us to your friends!

277
00:32:03,647 --> 00:32:05,153
We'll have to kill you.

278
00:32:06,671 --> 00:32:07,434
Talk!

279
00:32:10,316 --> 00:32:12,461
Where are your friends?

280
00:32:22,366 --> 00:32:23,730
Open your mouth!

281
00:32:24,287 --> 00:32:26,646
- No!
- You take us!

282
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:06,134
What's the idiot doing?

283
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,872
What now?

284
00:33:09,992 --> 00:33:12,748
There's nothing we
can do without him.

285
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:14,633
And he took the car.

286
00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:17,236
That idiot can't even drive.

287
00:33:17,732 --> 00:33:19,257
What a disaster!

288
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:21,091
Let's wait a bit longer.

289
00:33:21,412 --> 00:33:24,705
- Shall I look for him?
- Let's look on the other side.

290
00:34:20,385 --> 00:34:21,372
It's me...

291
00:34:21,761 --> 00:34:22,778
<i>Chuji.</i>

292
00:34:28,439 --> 00:34:29,740
What a surprise!

293
00:34:33,026 --> 00:34:35,331
Run! Run!

294
00:34:49,272 --> 00:34:51,479
You bastard...!

295
00:35:29,276 --> 00:35:30,490
Masaaki!

296
00:36:02,485 --> 00:36:04,493
You've spotted Fujimoto Koichi?

297
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:09,018
Location...? Yes...

298
00:36:10,555 --> 00:36:11,807
Hakata ward...

299
00:36:13,063 --> 00:36:13,943
Chiyo...

300
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:15,492
First district...

301
00:36:18,021 --> 00:36:20,767
Opposite Kimura Clinic...

302
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:25,241
Detective Kurosaki spotted him
while he was out on patrol.

303
00:36:25,361 --> 00:36:28,488
At the moment, Fujimoto is
having lunch at the restaurant.

304
00:36:28,608 --> 00:36:31,212
Detective Noguchi is
inside, as a customer.

305
00:36:31,332 --> 00:36:34,561
10 police officers in plain
clothes are on watch nearby.

306
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:36,210
Your orders?

307
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,768
It's dangerous;
Fujimoto might have a gun.

308
00:36:40,583 --> 00:36:43,149
We’ll send for back-up.
Stay there and wait.

309
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:44,364
Yes, sir.

310
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:48,876
Welcome.

311
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,961
It's me, Masaaki.

312
00:37:25,081 --> 00:37:27,007
Oh, you? That took a while.

313
00:37:27,215 --> 00:37:31,048
We were attacked by guys
from the Tenryu Gang over there.

314
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:34,630
The Tenryu Gang?
Are you alright, then?

315
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,481
I’m alright, but I
think they got Chuji.

316
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:38,984
Chuji?

317
00:37:39,626 --> 00:37:41,647
- Really?
- How about the others?

318
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:42,953
Not here yet.

319
00:37:43,073 --> 00:37:44,027
I see...

320
00:37:44,353 --> 00:37:47,718
They’re still at the park,
waiting for Chuji ...

321
00:37:52,624 --> 00:37:54,992
Then I’ll go and
meet the others now.

322
00:37:55,921 --> 00:37:57,358
Wait for us. Alright?

323
00:38:11,298 --> 00:38:12,922
What the... It's you?

324
00:38:14,624 --> 00:38:16,198
Grandma told me...

325
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:18,053
- What?
- You killed...

326
00:38:35,087 --> 00:38:36,042
Status?

327
00:38:37,306 --> 00:38:40,716
30 police officers have
checked the surrounding area.

328
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:44,143
Detective Tanaka is on
his way to the restaurant.

329
00:38:44,764 --> 00:38:46,884
Be careful.
I'm sure he has a gun.

330
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:08,432
Thank you.

331
00:39:23,945 --> 00:39:24,925
Don't shoot!

332
00:39:25,045 --> 00:39:26,350
Down!

333
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,491
Don't shoot!

334
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:29,623
Down! Down!

335
00:40:38,915 --> 00:40:40,353
One man in custody!

336
00:40:44,531 --> 00:40:46,341
Caught in the act.

337
00:41:00,236 --> 00:41:01,984
Let me go!

338
00:41:02,104 --> 00:41:04,240
Let me go, filthy swine!

339
00:41:07,697 --> 00:41:09,371
Our country is in danger!

340
00:41:10,697 --> 00:41:12,023
Japan is in danger!

341
00:41:28,348 --> 00:41:30,071
To Higashi Park.

342
00:41:32,662 --> 00:41:34,348
Go a bit faster.

343
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:38,017
You can go faster.

344
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,618
Will it take much longer?

345
00:41:41,126 --> 00:41:42,478
Just hurry up!

346
00:41:43,593 --> 00:41:45,180
Come on, hurry up!

347
00:42:04,265 --> 00:42:05,951
Take us to Higashi Park!

348
00:42:10,284 --> 00:42:11,523
Come on!

349
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:20,412
<i>Seikei Kindergarten</i>

350
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,468
Here they are.

351
00:42:25,063 --> 00:42:26,861
Hurry up, to Higashi Park.

352
00:42:35,475 --> 00:42:36,814
Driver!

353
00:42:37,335 --> 00:42:39,368
Right to Higashi Park!

354
00:42:44,321 --> 00:42:47,102
- Oshan...
- That's bad.

355
00:42:47,259 --> 00:42:49,441
If we don't go,
the cops will get us.

356
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:53,230
That guy really
is such a big idiot!

357
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,949
We can't just stay here.
We have to go and meet Masaaki.

358
00:42:57,668 --> 00:42:59,800
It's just too much.

359
00:43:00,425 --> 00:43:02,458
Where the hell did he go?

360
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,272
- Go and give Marimo a call.
- Okay.

361
00:43:14,818 --> 00:43:16,665
Faster, man!

362
00:43:25,908 --> 00:43:30,216
Yazawa Masaaki, suspect in
the murder of Yamaoka Ryuichiro...

363
00:43:31,071 --> 00:43:36,786
has hijacked a kindergarten bus
and is heading towards Higashi Park.

364
00:43:37,393 --> 00:43:39,302
Roger, keep on following them.

365
00:43:39,587 --> 00:43:41,311
He's going to meet his pals.

366
00:43:41,431 --> 00:43:44,271
Kaneda is down, so he
will meet Oki and Kobayashi.

367
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:47,763
We’ve linked them to the
recent bank robbery.

368
00:43:48,469 --> 00:43:50,639
Stay back until
those guys arrive.

369
00:43:50,759 --> 00:43:53,205
<i>- We’ll send back-up.
- Understood.</i>

370
00:44:22,015 --> 00:44:23,453
Hey, Manji!

371
00:44:29,043 --> 00:44:30,320
What's going on?

372
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:34,083
The guys from the
Tenryu Gang got Chuji.

373
00:44:34,827 --> 00:44:37,090
So I’m here instead
to meet you guys.

374
00:44:37,896 --> 00:44:38,937
Shit!

375
00:44:39,057 --> 00:44:41,664
We've no time for talking.
What will we do?

376
00:44:43,246 --> 00:44:46,408
- Wait, I'll get Oshan!
- Quick!

377
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:04,120
- Masaaki is here.
- Masaaki? And Chuji?

378
00:45:10,705 --> 00:45:11,747
Follow them.

379
00:45:19,895 --> 00:45:22,251
- The cops!
- Police?

380
00:46:04,647 --> 00:46:05,540
Police!

381
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,189
Just shoot them down.

382
00:46:07,722 --> 00:46:10,784
We'll take the brats in the
kindergarten as hostages!

383
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:42,228
There are no kids here.

384
00:46:42,476 --> 00:46:44,285
Summer holidays or what?

385
00:46:44,405 --> 00:46:46,195
Manji, come here.

386
00:46:47,864 --> 00:46:49,228
What are you doing?

387
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,802
No need to worry.

388
00:46:51,211 --> 00:46:52,662
We've got a hostage.

389
00:46:53,548 --> 00:46:56,424
We'll get a
helicopter and cut loose.

390
00:46:56,997 --> 00:46:58,892
They won't get us!

391
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:01,396
Down! Down!

392
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,297
Oshan, you think we can get away?

393
00:47:08,146 --> 00:47:09,602
Of course we can.

394
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:11,952
I’m excited once again.

395
00:47:19,434 --> 00:47:22,930
The gangsters have taken
refuge in a kindergarten.

396
00:47:23,178 --> 00:47:25,967
Send back-up immediately.

397
00:48:10,551 --> 00:48:11,939
Stay down!

398
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:40,420
Stop! You can't enter!

399
00:48:40,698 --> 00:48:42,805
We’re from the press!
Let us report!

400
00:49:10,642 --> 00:49:12,836
Hey, you!

401
00:49:13,072 --> 00:49:15,018
What do you think?

402
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:18,254
Want me to cut off your ear?

403
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:21,238
Oshan!

404
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,114
- Got any ideas what to do?
- I’m thinking about it.

405
00:49:24,623 --> 00:49:25,466
Status?

406
00:49:25,714 --> 00:49:27,214
They have one hostage.

407
00:49:29,123 --> 00:49:30,722
Wait for further orders.

408
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:31,777
Understood.

409
00:49:44,038 --> 00:49:46,952
You’re all surrounded.

410
00:49:47,348 --> 00:49:48,972
You can't run anymore.

411
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,852
Let the hostage go, put down
your guns and come out right now.

412
00:49:53,258 --> 00:49:56,503
Nobody got hurt so far.
Come out right now.

413
00:49:57,752 --> 00:50:00,319
You’re all surrounded.

414
00:50:00,901 --> 00:50:02,624
You can't get out of there.

415
00:50:02,744 --> 00:50:06,009
Let the hostage go, put down
your guns and come out right now.

416
00:50:06,678 --> 00:50:08,835
Nobody got hurt so far.

417
00:50:09,654 --> 00:50:11,253
Come out right now.

418
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:22,106
You’re all surrounded.

419
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:24,375
You can't get away.

420
00:50:24,495 --> 00:50:28,305
Let the hostage go, put down
your guns and come out right now.

421
00:50:29,495 --> 00:50:30,536
Shut up!

422
00:50:32,915 --> 00:50:35,444
If you have conditions,
let us hear them!

423
00:50:35,564 --> 00:50:37,948
We want a helicopter.

424
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:39,498
Impossible.

425
00:50:39,725 --> 00:50:42,452
How about that helicopter up there?

426
00:50:42,877 --> 00:50:44,934
You think we’re stupid?

427
00:50:45,054 --> 00:50:46,913
That one belongs to the press.

428
00:50:47,437 --> 00:50:48,792
Give it to me!

429
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,867
Listen to our demands...

430
00:50:52,987 --> 00:50:54,949
Or there'll be bloodshed.

431
00:50:55,854 --> 00:50:57,998
Hey, Kobayashi! Kobayashi!

432
00:50:58,283 --> 00:51:00,453
Sure, I’m all up for it.

433
00:51:04,411 --> 00:51:05,887
Wait! Wait!

434
00:51:06,581 --> 00:51:08,019
We'll have it ready.

435
00:51:08,292 --> 00:51:11,106
The criminals seem
to be very upset at the moment.

436
00:51:11,226 --> 00:51:15,916
<i>Despite the hard work of the police,
the situation remains very dangerous.</i>

437
00:51:16,184 --> 00:51:19,345
<i>Among the men who have taken
refuge in a kindergarten are...</i>

438
00:51:19,465 --> 00:51:23,461
<i>the two suspects in the recent
murder of Yamaoka Ryuichiro...</i>

439
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:27,076
<i>Yazawa Masaaki, wanted for
arrest in the whole country,</i>

440
00:51:27,196 --> 00:51:30,584
<i>and with him the suspects of the
Hakata bank robbery this afternoon,</i>

441
00:51:30,704 --> 00:51:34,911
<i>who robbed 2.3 Million yen:
Oki Saburo...</i>

442
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:36,954
<i>Kobayashi Jun and...</i>

443
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:39,545
Boys, look at this! Quick!

444
00:51:44,169 --> 00:51:46,884
Those are the swine
who killed my son!

445
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,277
Let us through!

446
00:51:59,765 --> 00:52:02,174
You bastard!

447
00:52:02,294 --> 00:52:07,005
You've let those guys run away
and now they’re out there in action.

448
00:52:07,548 --> 00:52:11,069
Now stop sitting around,
and do something about it.

449
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,623
What are you doing?

450
00:52:13,743 --> 00:52:17,713
If you come back without having
killed them you'll be dead instead.

451
00:52:18,025 --> 00:52:19,575
You'll be in deep shit.

452
00:52:19,695 --> 00:52:23,083
I think you got that right now.

453
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:26,318
Go and kill them!
Go and kill them!

454
00:52:45,258 --> 00:52:47,242
The helicopter, quickly!

455
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:51,374
The helicopter’s ready.

456
00:52:51,647 --> 00:52:53,556
Now let the hostage go free.

457
00:52:53,676 --> 00:52:56,457
Liar! I can't see a helicopter!

458
00:53:02,845 --> 00:53:06,111
Oshan, I guess they think that
we wouldn't hurt the hostage.

459
00:53:06,477 --> 00:53:08,473
Kobayashi, bring her here.

460
00:53:08,593 --> 00:53:10,320
<i>Get up, this way!</i>

461
00:53:14,408 --> 00:53:16,367
Shall we chop off one of her arms?

462
00:53:17,681 --> 00:53:19,801
We'll really do it!

463
00:53:20,123 --> 00:53:22,206
You want her arm so much?

464
00:53:25,446 --> 00:53:27,095
Now, hurry up!

465
00:53:27,215 --> 00:53:28,379
The helicopter!

466
00:53:30,529 --> 00:53:31,422
Let's go!

467
00:54:56,839 --> 00:54:59,529
Oshan, I found us a
nice little treasure here.

468
00:55:37,331 --> 00:55:38,687
One injured person!

469
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:40,683
<i>One injured person!</i>

470
00:55:41,167 --> 00:55:42,184
<i>Over here.</i>

471
00:55:42,304 --> 00:55:44,948
<i>It's his right leg!
His right leg!</i>

472
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:52,211
Oh, man...

473
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:58,075
It's just too much.

474
00:55:58,633 --> 00:56:00,244
We should just give up.

475
00:56:01,044 --> 00:56:02,258
Impossible!

476
00:56:03,844 --> 00:56:05,840
We don't have a chance like this.

477
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:07,923
They'll take new
action in the morning.

478
00:56:08,976 --> 00:56:11,183
They’ve got us all surrounded.

479
00:56:12,921 --> 00:56:14,934
We'll use the hostages as shields...

480
00:56:15,054 --> 00:56:16,616
And break through.

481
00:56:17,285 --> 00:56:19,727
You can't believe that yourself.

482
00:56:20,475 --> 00:56:24,392
It's the only way. The police
will come and get us soon.

483
00:56:25,446 --> 00:56:26,809
They'll be shocked.

484
00:56:30,277 --> 00:56:31,319
What's next?

485
00:56:32,732 --> 00:56:34,864
At dawn, I'll give you a signal.

486
00:56:34,984 --> 00:56:37,641
Then we’ll take the hostages
and attack the police.

487
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:40,130
You think you can
get away that easily?

488
00:56:40,662 --> 00:56:42,324
Shut the fuck up.

489
00:56:46,526 --> 00:56:48,038
<i>This is a live report.</i>

490
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:50,745
<i>It is now already
more than 10 hours since...</i>

491
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:54,356
<i>four gangsters with a hostage
took refuge in a kindergarten.</i>

492
00:56:54,476 --> 00:56:57,920
<i>A serious incident occurred this
afternoon around 5:30:</i>

493
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:02,035
<i>gangsters of the Tenryukai tried to
enter the place using armed force.</i>

494
00:57:02,155 --> 00:57:05,725
<i>This resulted in the deaths of
three police officers and one gangster.</i>

495
00:57:05,845 --> 00:57:08,589
<i>In addition, more than
10 police officers were wounded.</i>

496
00:57:08,709 --> 00:57:11,514
<i>After that, there has been
absolutely no movement at all.</i>

497
00:57:11,634 --> 00:57:14,568
<i>There are no new developments.</i>

498
00:57:14,688 --> 00:57:17,496
The gangsters must be at
their limit already...

499
00:57:18,141 --> 00:57:19,170
Masaaki.

500
00:57:20,045 --> 00:57:21,781
Did you attend kindergarten?

501
00:57:23,739 --> 00:57:25,351
I don't think he did.

502
00:57:25,603 --> 00:57:27,611
I mean, look at him!

503
00:57:27,731 --> 00:57:30,252
Look who's talking.
Look at your face!

504
00:57:32,545 --> 00:57:34,397
This boy, his name is Oki too.

505
00:57:35,335 --> 00:57:37,409
He hasn't got a
bright future then.

506
00:57:38,211 --> 00:57:40,157
You know yourself pretty well, Oshan.

507
00:57:40,277 --> 00:57:43,541
- Shame about the name...
- He just looks terrible there.

508
00:57:44,111 --> 00:57:46,528
Is there any kid called Kobayashi?

509
00:57:47,384 --> 00:57:48,937
If there was...

510
00:57:49,057 --> 00:57:51,152
he would have to be a bright boy.

511
00:57:52,094 --> 00:57:54,227
Hey, Officer Saeba!

512
00:57:55,178 --> 00:57:57,607
I'm sure you went to kindergarten?

513
00:58:01,364 --> 00:58:03,632
You haven't wet yourself, have you?

514
00:58:08,645 --> 00:58:09,673
Hey, Manji!

515
00:58:11,012 --> 00:58:12,735
You want to go home?

516
00:58:13,901 --> 00:58:15,748
Nah, it's fun being here.

517
00:58:16,987 --> 00:58:18,432
Wanna go to Korea?

518
00:58:19,052 --> 00:58:20,923
Is Korea far away?

519
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:23,130
Quite near, actually.

520
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,779
Not far away?

521
00:58:25,825 --> 00:58:28,457
- Let's go then.
- Fine.

522
00:58:28,577 --> 00:58:30,313
I'll take you there, Manji.

523
00:58:30,982 --> 00:58:33,920
We'll finish off this shit
here tomorrow morning.

524
00:58:34,379 --> 00:58:35,284
Alright?

525
01:00:24,947 --> 01:00:27,922
He is... he is...
Leave him...

526
01:01:26,104 --> 01:01:27,480
I did it!

527
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,253
Handcuffs! Handcuffs!

528
01:01:32,587 --> 01:01:34,410
Gotcha!

529
01:01:46,556 --> 01:01:48,019
Don't take photos!

530
01:01:49,854 --> 01:01:51,565
Out of the way!

531
01:01:52,532 --> 01:01:53,920
Let us pass!

532
01:03:31,663 --> 01:03:32,742
There he is.

533
01:03:38,977 --> 01:03:40,279
There's one guy.

534
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:41,841
I thought four guys...?

535
01:03:42,903 --> 01:03:45,408
It's a cop! Shoot!

536
01:03:45,705 --> 01:03:47,453
Wait! I’m not...

537
01:05:58,911 --> 01:06:09,496
THE END
