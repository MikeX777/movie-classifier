00:18:43,294 --> 00:18:46,155
Who'll take'em? Who'll buy'em?

178
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,997
A champipi...
Voilà two champignons.

179
00:18:54,877 --> 00:18:57,976
Who wants a lovely chanterelle?

180
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:02,602
Who wants a lovely chanterelle?
Who wants'em? Who'll buy'em?

181
00:19:03,718 --> 00:19:07,068
Who wants'em? Who'll buy'em?

182
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:17,410

183
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,465
four.

184
00:19:20,215 --> 00:19:22,552
Badaboom... Boom!

185
00:19:23,982 --> 00:19:25,138
Boom!

186
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,194
Ah...

187
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:31,164
Champipi,

188
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:32,880
champipi...

189
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:39,779
Look at my chanterelles!
Look at my champipi!

190
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:42,103
Looking for mushrooms, Parju?

191
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:44,802
Aquatic mushrooms!

192
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:58,526
- Looking for something?
- Where are the trouts?

193
00:19:58,576 --> 00:20:00,006
Trouts?

194
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:02,105
Oh!
Ah!

195
00:20:02,172 --> 00:20:05,463
- Trouts!
- But fishing season's over.

196
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:25,536
They call that representing
law and order.

197
00:20:25,581 --> 00:20:27,655
I'll get you, Blaireau! I'll get you.

198
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:58,846
Who wants mushrooms,
champipi, champignons?

199
00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:01,263
Not only are you incapable of

200
00:21:01,336 --> 00:21:04,911
maintaining order, but you
actively create disorder, huh?

201
00:21:04,981 --> 00:21:07,274
Ah, Arabella, how's your papa?

202
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,339
He's a blast.

203
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,587
-And your mother?
-She's a blast, too.

204
00:21:11,018 --> 00:21:14,322
Come on! Don't just stand there!

205
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:18,193
- The "Noir" serials came in.
- I know, thanks.

206
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:20,349
I read that one, I read this...

207
00:21:20,815 --> 00:21:23,394
Ah! "You Can Run",
I didn't read this one.

208
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,188
-Hold on, I'll check the others.
- Hello, M.Fléchard* [*wishy washy]

209
00:21:28,232 --> 00:21:30,608
- Hello, M. Fléchard.
- Hello, ... uh...

210
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:33,325
- What would you like?
- "The Two of Us".

211
00:21:43,689 --> 00:21:45,044
No more "Two of Us".

212
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:49,541
"Don't Shoot the Piano Player",
I won't take it today.

213
00:21:49,815 --> 00:21:51,815
-I'll put it back.
- Oh!

214
00:21:52,315 --> 00:21:55,097
- What do I owe you?
- 220.

215
00:21:57,413 --> 00:22:00,457
- Has the "Paris Match" arrived?
- It's out front.

216
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:19,940
M. Fléchard, see you later for my lesson.
- Very well.

217
00:22:23,144 --> 00:22:26,398
Some roses and ...

218
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,197
everlasting daisies, for mama.

219
00:23:09,715 --> 00:23:11,539
Oh, my note!

220
00:23:28,498 --> 00:23:32,648
Hey, Tarzan?

221
00:23:34,103 --> 00:23:36,762
Let's get to work, mademoiselle

222
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:42,127

224
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:47,337

More passion.

225
00:23:48,036 --> 00:23:50,732
-What are you thinking of?
- Oh, whatever.

226
00:23:50,794 --> 00:23:53,142
Think of, I dunno, let's say...

227
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:55,036
the man you love.

228
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:56,465
That's not likely to happen soon.

229
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,781
I couldn't love anyone, but
a man of action.

230
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:02,732
Someone like me. And in Montpaillard,
there are only wieners!

231
00:24:04,207 --> 00:24:05,768
Thank you, mademoiselle.

232
00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:07,934
So I'm a wiener.

233
00:24:08,092 --> 00:24:10,730
- You're from Dijon!
- That's easy to say.

234
00:24:10,814 --> 00:24:12,356
What's wrong with him?

235
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,289
Ah, women!

236
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:19,092
Gentlemen, it's thanks to a woman

237
00:24:19,117 --> 00:24:21,693
that I began my carreer
in administration.

238
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,446
She threw money out the window,

239
00:24:26,471 --> 00:24:28,145
and I watched it drop.

240
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:29,323
That's so Parisian!

241
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,379
At the time,
I was a minister's cousin.

242
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:32,707
You're no longer his cousin?

243
00:24:32,754 --> 00:24:34,427
He's no longer minister.

244
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:38,486
He barely had time to
post me to Montpaillard.

245
00:24:38,503 --> 00:24:40,551
And not a moment too soon.
My alternatives were...

246
00:24:40,589 --> 00:24:44,029
become a wardenn, or go to prison myself.

247
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,091
Another trout?

248
00:24:46,989 --> 00:24:48,888
I can be tempted.

249
00:24:49,391 --> 00:24:52,538
Yes, I haven't had trout...

250
00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:56,450
since the close of the fishing season.

251
00:24:56,798 --> 00:24:59,686
In fact, fishing opens tomorrow.

252
00:25:00,807 --> 00:25:02,440
Léontine!

253
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,838
- Monsieur?
- It's Blaireau, naturally?

254
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:08,672
- I thought it'd please you Monsieur.
- Miserable! Shameless! Go!

255
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:09,898
And take that with you!

256
00:25:14,243 --> 00:25:16,479
Oh! I had a thought, messieurs!

257
00:25:16,661 --> 00:25:20,745
We've got that rascal! Red handed.
What's the penalty?

258
00:25:20,814 --> 00:25:25,688
- Maximum, 6 months.
- Scandalous, but better than nothing.

259
00:25:25,811 --> 00:25:28,410
In the clink, you rotter!
In the clink!

260
00:25:28,887 --> 00:25:32,035
6 months for poaching and
3 for receiving poached goods

261
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,715
Great! We'll make a clean sweep!

262
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:37,566
Receivers of poached goods are
those who eat Blaireau's trouts.

OPENING OF FISHING SEASON
GRAND CONTEST

264
00:25:46,198 --> 00:25:50,429
Public notice: tomorrow at the

266
00:25:54,496 --> 00:25:56,868
a grand fishing contest.

You can register at the Café Botineau!

272
00:26:15,056 --> 00:26:16,699
- Hello!
- Hello Blaireau.

273
00:26:16,814 --> 00:26:21,103
- I'll register tomorrow...
- I'll collect mudworms.

274
00:26:21,254 --> 00:26:25,586
- You guys make me laugh.
- What bait would you use, Blaireau?

275
00:26:25,674 --> 00:26:28,233
Contests are for choirboys!

276
00:26:28,318 --> 00:26:31,909
- Your turn, Blaireau!
- Not for me, for my dog.

277
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:36,096
Well trimmed at the back.
The ears like always.

278

Messieurs!

279
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:40,908
- Mr. Mayor!
- Mr. Mayor!

280
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:43,735
What? Mr. Mayor, you're in the contest?

281
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:46,136
Counselor Guilloche,
I never neglect an occasion

282
00:26:46,161 --> 00:26:48,030
to get close to my constituents.

283
00:26:48,069 --> 00:26:50,077
If you were in touch with
your constituents.

284
00:26:50,102 --> 00:26:52,177
you wouldn't need to
get close to them.

285
00:26:52,202 --> 00:26:56,115
-Give me some N° 4 fish-hooks.
-Number 4?! They're for whales!

286
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:01,005
"Each angler is allowed
a single line: floating,

287

"or red rubber."

290
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:10,182
Shall I sign you up?
- Yes.

291
00:27:12,193 --> 00:27:14,701
Gentlemen, I drink to fishing...

292
00:27:14,825 --> 00:27:16,560
a democratic sport...

293
00:27:16,638 --> 00:27:20,122
symbol of liberty and independence

294
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,646
Long live fishing!

295
00:27:22,802 --> 00:27:27,463
Last year I caught 7 bottom
feeding roaches as big as my hand.

296
00:27:27,866 --> 00:27:31,154
- Bleaks!
- No, bottom roaches!

297
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:35,380
In 1913, I caught a 18 pound Koi!

298
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:38,849
Like Auguste's pike!

299
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:42,474
Exactly, a pike this big!

300
00:27:43,055 --> 00:27:44,533
A monster!

301
00:27:46,437 --> 00:27:48,355
How big was your pike?

302
00:27:48,403 --> 00:27:50,599
- Like that.
- Eh...

303
00:27:51,662 --> 00:27:52,903
Like that.

304
00:27:52,976 --> 00:27:56,458
Cut it out Blaireau. It's easy to
catch fish when the season's closed.

305
00:27:56,498 --> 00:27:59,380
In a fair contest, you're no
cleverer than the rest.

- Morning, kids!
- Morning, Director.

529
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,247
- How's your tonsils?
- I gargled this morning.

530
00:49:55,272 --> 00:49:59,669
Let's see. Swelling's down,
keep up the treatment.

531
00:49:59,794 --> 00:50:02,161
-Good news from your wife?
-Yes, thank God, director.

532
00:50:02,229 --> 00:50:04,216
Very good. Back to work.

533
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:08,075
As you see, Blaireau,

534
00:50:08,164 --> 00:50:11,210
my penal system's very simple.

535
00:50:12,575 --> 00:50:13,747
After you.

536
00:50:13,818 --> 00:50:17,090
I occupy my men with the work
they used to do

537
00:50:17,115 --> 00:50:19,535
before they took a bad turn.

538
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:24,518
- Hello, director.
- Hello, Grégory!

539
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:29,163
Our latest addition.

540
00:50:31,345 --> 00:50:34,886
- Hello, monsieur.
- An excellent pedicurist.

541
00:50:35,126 --> 00:50:37,439
- Ah!
- Eh, watch it!

542
00:50:37,978 --> 00:50:41,383
'Was', an excellent pedicurist.

543
00:50:43,283 --> 00:50:45,946
Hello, Antoine.
- Mr. Directeur.

544
00:50:46,029 --> 00:50:47,558
Our tailor.

545
00:50:47,722 --> 00:50:50,027
My dear Blaireau,
I don't have much

546
00:50:50,074 --> 00:50:51,697
available, at the moment,

547
00:50:51,722 --> 00:50:54,353
but I'll show you around, and
you can choose your own room.

548
00:50:54,415 --> 00:50:56,697
You're too kind, Director.

549
00:50:56,748 --> 00:50:58,654
There! Number 14.

550
00:51:00,459 --> 00:51:04,371
Good exposure, but a bit warm
during this season.

551
00:51:11,686 --> 00:51:14,142
You've got nothing better?

552
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:19,365
Wait, I have just the thing.

553
00:51:20,228 --> 00:51:21,780
Little number 4.

554
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,313
Ah, my dear Blaireau,

555
00:51:23,338 --> 00:51:25,842
may I present Victor,
our Head Guard.

556
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,646
- Enchanté.
- Welcome.

557
00:51:27,713 --> 00:51:30,641
It matters to me that you feel...

558
00:51:30,711 --> 00:51:32,492
ah, how can I put it...

559
00:51:32,562 --> 00:51:35,117
that you're in a home-style prison.

560
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:38,956
Victor, number 4.

561
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:42,333
My dear Blaireau, see you later,
I'll let you get settled.

562
00:51:42,373 --> 00:51:44,340
Thank you, Mr. Director.

563
00:51:44,371 --> 00:51:48,293
Ah, I wanted to ask,
your morning coffee; black or with milk?

564
00:51:48,334 --> 00:51:49,812
Spiked with liqueur.

565
00:51:53,524 --> 00:51:57,577
Always the same thing when
he tries to marry her off.

566
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:03,974
Doesn't seem she's convinced.

567
00:52:04,095 --> 00:52:05,823
You want me to marry?
- Yes.

568
00:52:05,871 --> 00:52:07,247
As fast as possible?
- Yes!

569
00:52:07,272 --> 00:52:08,733
Fine, I found one.
-Finally!

570
00:52:08,767 --> 00:52:11,015
A man who's proved himself!
- Perfect!

571
00:52:11,064 --> 00:52:15,351
She'll only marry the man of her dreams;
her ideal, her prince charming.

572
00:52:17,171 --> 00:52:19,724
She wants to marry Blaireau!

576
00:52:44,715 --> 00:52:47,382
I'll say it was already torn.

577
00:52:50,106 --> 00:52:51,787
Come on, come.

578
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:03,569
Oh, my puppy!
I'm so happy to see my big bow-wow!

579
00:53:04,046 --> 00:53:06,597
Oh, my little bow-wow...

580
00:53:07,715 --> 00:53:10,480
It's not him! It's not him!

581
00:53:10,962 --> 00:53:12,488

582
00:53:19,611 --> 00:53:21,184

586
00:53:38,325 --> 00:53:40,738
What are you doing, sweety?

587
00:53:40,763 --> 00:53:42,708
A package for my fiancé, papa.

588
00:53:43,561 --> 00:53:44,741
What?

589
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:49,888
Hold this, papa.

590
00:53:53,324 --> 00:53:54,851
Thank you, papa.

591
00:53:58,378 --> 00:54:00,452
No, not the clock.

00:57:03,552 --> 00:57:05,005
Do I ever?

635
00:57:05,086 --> 00:57:06,162

Ask him, I say.

657
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:40,116
- No.
- Old 'pops Bluette ' is a pal.

658
00:58:40,179 --> 00:58:42,250
I couldn't ask him that.

659
00:58:42,348 --> 00:58:45,711
He did it for a guy, once.
For his daughter's first communion.

660
00:58:45,754 --> 00:58:48,138
What's up, dear Blaireau?

661
00:58:48,379 --> 00:58:49,952
Ask him, go on.

662
00:58:51,989 --> 00:58:55,411
M. Bluette , tonight's a new moon.

663
00:58:55,743 --> 00:58:57,014

664
00:58:57,147 --> 00:59:01,132

and with this weather,

665
00:59:01,274 --> 00:59:03,693
we're on Easy Street.

666
00:59:03,884 --> 00:59:07,174
Oh, yeah? Oh, I see you coming.

667
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,620
No, Blaireau. No!

668
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:18,469
You'll be back at midnight.
Hm, swear?

669
00:59:19,016 --> 00:59:21,136
M. Bluette , I swear.

670
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,347
Blaireau...

671
00:59:28,887 --> 00:59:31,296
won't you take me with you?

672
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:34,651
But... M. Bluette ...
Are you serious?

673
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:37,127
It'd make me so happy!

674
00:59:38,314 --> 00:59:40,925
I shouldn't, but...

675
00:59:56,099 --> 00:59:57,174
- Look.
- Oooh...

- Right, we need to get in.
- OK, let's go.

702
01:02:56,992 --> 01:02:58,530
Watch out!

703
01:03:25,757 --> 01:03:27,174
Well, Victor?

704
01:03:27,259 --> 01:03:30,311
Director! Good evening.

705
01:03:31,598 --> 01:03:32,942
What's the meaning of this?

706
01:03:32,977 --> 01:03:35,692
I took the liberty of
taking them to the cinema.

707
01:03:35,903 --> 01:03:38,735
- Are you mad?!
- But, under cover of dark.

708
01:03:38,768 --> 01:03:41,427
I see, well no big deal,
open up.

709
01:03:41,467 --> 01:03:43,284
Yes, Director.

710
01:03:47,304 --> 01:03:50,376
- I'll be...
- Don't tell me that...

711
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:53,022
- Yes.
- Ah no!

712
01:03:53,218 --> 01:03:56,078
Good thing you've got yours, Director.

713
01:03:56,628 --> 01:03:58,450
That's just it...

714
01:03:58,536 --> 01:04:00,456
Allow me.

715
01:04:06,152 --> 01:04:09,204
- Bravo.
- A handyman's skill.

716
01:04:13,959 --> 01:04:16,817
Tell me, what did you see
at the cinéma?

717
01:04:16,872 --> 01:04:20,079
"Arsène Lupin".
Imagine how happy they were!

718
01:04:22,367 --> 01:04:23,986
Oh, you're much better.

719
01:04:24,085 --> 01:04:26,281
I told you: a 3 week diet.

720
01:04:26,306 --> 01:04:28,075
I could sure eat something.

721
01:04:28,146 --> 01:04:29,148
By all means...

722
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:30,752
You need to regain your strength, now.

723
01:04:30,807 --> 01:04:32,332
Blaireau gets out of prison tomorrow.

724
01:04:32,363 --> 01:04:33,364
Blaireau?!

725
01:04:33,395 --> 01:04:36,580
If it's any consolation,
he's as sick as you are.

726
01:04:36,595 --> 01:04:38,529
How are you, Blaireau?

727
01:04:38,743 --> 01:04:41,604
Oh, my liver, ugh... enormous.

728
01:04:42,423 --> 01:04:44,841
With me, it's my stomach.

729
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,983
Good thing I get out tomorrow.

730
01:04:50,204 --> 01:04:51,806
Oh no, oh no.

731
01:04:52,001 --> 01:04:53,290
Oh no.

732
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,299
- Aaah!
- Aaah!

733
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:08,300
BRAKES CAN SLIP
INSURANCE STICKS

734
01:05:11,723 --> 01:05:13,540
A PACKAGE FOR BLAIREAU?

735
01:05:13,588 --> 01:05:14,743
Why?

736
01:05:15,313 --> 01:05:16,490
It's my secret.

737
01:05:16,515 --> 01:05:18,288
Arabella, I want the truth.

738
01:05:18,313 --> 01:05:20,235
You're drunk, Mr Fléchard!

739
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:22,872
But, Arabella. Mademoiselle!

740
01:05:34,832 --> 01:05:36,794
And Blaireau accepted your package?

741
01:05:36,896 --> 01:05:37,661
Yes, papa!

742
01:05:37,686 --> 01:05:39,234
-Jams, fruits?
-Yes!

743
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:40,318
The ...?

744
01:05:40,352 --> 01:05:43,482
Murderous demons of the speed!

745
01:05:43,816 --> 01:05:46,013
-Blaireau is innocent.
- That's a lie!

746
01:05:46,063 --> 01:05:47,630
I smacked Parju!

747
01:05:47,671 --> 01:05:49,679
- You? Come on!
- Here's the proof!

748
01:05:49,704 --> 01:05:52,669
- I don't believe you.
- The man who loves you from the shadows

749
01:05:52,730 --> 01:05:55,677
- You've read my letters!
- I wrote them.

750
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,738
- You?
- Yes.

751
01:05:56,763 --> 01:05:58,888
- But why?
- Because I love you!

752
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:00,458
- What?
- I love you!

753
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:01,958
- What?
- I love you!

754
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:08,034
I LOVE YOU!

755
01:06:10,677 --> 01:06:13,347
You did that?... You?

756
01:06:14,489 --> 01:06:15,679
Yes.

757
01:06:21,113 --> 01:06:22,774
What's he done?

758
01:06:25,116 --> 01:06:27,666
-That's really marvellous.
-Yes, Arabella!

759
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:30,333
-You'll be sent to prison.
-Yes... what?

760
01:06:30,379 --> 01:06:32,886
And I thought you were insipid,
idiotic, insignificant!

761
01:06:32,927 --> 01:06:35,486
But if you're in prison,
I'll be crazy about you.

762
01:06:35,511 --> 01:06:37,380
In prison? I'm going.

763
01:06:38,042 --> 01:06:40,762
- You'd do that for me?
- Yes, Arabella.

764
01:06:40,899 --> 01:06:42,563
Right away?

765
01:06:42,669 --> 01:06:44,369
I'm going! I'm going!

766
01:06:44,982 --> 01:06:47,497
Fléchard! Fléchard!
Where are you going?

767
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,706
To a Court of the Republic
to admit to my crime.

768
01:06:49,744 --> 01:06:51,301
There is no crime in Montpaillard!

769
01:06:51,326 --> 01:06:53,818
I beat up Parju.
Blaireau's innocent.

770
01:06:53,849 --> 01:06:55,683
- What are you babbling about?
- I'm not babbling,

771
01:06:55,708 --> 01:06:56,841
I'm expiating.

772
01:06:57,207 --> 01:06:59,847
It's a miscarriage of justice.

773
01:06:59,872 --> 01:07:02,206
There are no judicial errors
in Montpaillard!

774
01:07:02,276 --> 01:07:04,110
It's a frightful scandal.

775
01:07:04,141 --> 01:07:06,330
There are no scandals in Montpaillard!

776
01:07:06,646 --> 01:07:09,590
Oh, there'll be one,
I garantee it.

777
01:07:10,284 --> 01:07:13,153
No, no, no...

778
01:07:13,575 --> 01:07:15,912
You don't just up and confess
at vacation time!

779
01:07:16,281 --> 01:07:19,237
Mr. Prosecutor,
remorse doesn't choose the day.

780
01:07:19,292 --> 01:07:20,581
Remorse!

781
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:23,974
Delaying my vacation doesn't
cause you any remorse?

782
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:26,091
My children's health
is of little import to you?

783
01:07:26,116 --> 01:07:28,180
When do I go to prison?

784
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,722
And you want to go to prison,
to boot? It's crowded there!

785
01:07:30,747 --> 01:07:32,710
I want to sleep in prison tonight.

786
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:36,036
Nossir, you will not sleep
in prison tonight.

787
01:07:36,513 --> 01:07:37,685
When then?

788
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,320
We'll notify you in writing!

789
01:07:39,507 --> 01:07:41,215
FOR ARMAND FLECHARD

790
01:07:43,972 --> 01:07:46,868
- Who is this package for?
- For my fiancé.

791
01:07:47,043 --> 01:07:50,031
- He just got out of prison.
- No, he's just going in.

792
01:07:50,146 --> 01:07:51,888
G-going in? Who?

793
01:07:52,137 --> 01:07:54,356
My new fiancé, papa.

794
01:07:56,576 --> 01:07:58,747
No! No! No!

795
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:00,496
-...La!
-Voila!

796
01:08:00,521 --> 01:08:02,308
So, that's it? I'm free?

797
01:08:02,333 --> 01:08:04,792
Yes. Goodbye, my old Blaireau.

798
01:08:04,877 --> 01:08:06,784
Send me news.

799
01:08:07,261 --> 01:08:09,771
I'll bring you some game.
- Oh, come on!

800
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:12,644
It won't cost much, for you or me.

801
01:08:12,669 --> 01:08:15,237
You still intend to poach?

802
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:19,052
We can't all be functionaries,
Mr Director.

803
01:08:19,146 --> 01:08:22,353
- See ya, M. Bluette.
- Goodbye, Blaireau.

804
01:08:29,665 --> 01:08:31,442
What's this?

805
01:08:37,908 --> 01:08:39,741
- Goodbye, Victor.
- Goodbye, Blaireau.

806
01:08:39,796 --> 01:08:41,356
Come back, one second!

807
01:08:41,381 --> 01:08:43,454
My pleasure, Directeur!

808
01:08:45,197 --> 01:08:46,771
It's incredible!

809
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:49,794
The real culprit gave a complete confession,

810
01:08:49,819 --> 01:08:52,435
and turned himself in to justice

811
01:08:53,013 --> 01:08:55,693
Ah, Blaireau. What would you say

812
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:57,986
if I told you
you were innocent?

813
01:08:58,065 --> 01:09:00,594
- That I already knew it.
- You were right, Blaireau.

814
01:09:00,619 --> 01:09:02,916
I just received a letter
from the public prosecutor.

815
01:09:02,982 --> 01:09:05,253
-You're innocent.
-Who did it?

816
01:09:05,278 --> 01:09:07,675
Fléchard, the piano teacher.

817
01:09:07,909 --> 01:09:09,909
Even professors are getting
involved, now?

818
01:09:09,972 --> 01:09:11,972
Here's exactly what's in the letter.

819
01:09:12,055 --> 01:09:14,432
"After the indispensable formalities,

820
01:09:14,485 --> 01:09:17,626
Blaireau will be set at liberty
as soon as possible."

821
01:09:17,663 --> 01:09:19,393
Now, I'm free.

822
01:09:19,418 --> 01:09:21,479
Woah there, "as soon as possible"!

823
01:09:21,773 --> 01:09:24,953
-How's that, "as soon as possible"?
-Blaireau, I'll handle that.

824
01:09:24,984 --> 01:09:26,828
- I'm going, now.
- No!

825
01:09:26,938 --> 01:09:28,070
What, "no"?!

826
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:31,734
You served your time
as a guilty man, alright.

827
01:09:32,289 --> 01:09:33,505
But...

828
01:09:33,825 --> 01:09:37,317
we learned today, you were innocent.

829
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,888
We find ourselves

830
01:09:38,919 --> 01:09:41,740
presented with new
formalities to fulfill.

831
01:09:41,779 --> 01:09:44,882
So, because I'm innocent
I have to stay in prison?!

832
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,955
The law is the law!

833
01:09:47,061 --> 01:09:50,154
To be imprisoned, it's not
absolutely necessary

834
01:09:50,179 --> 01:09:51,229
that you be guilty,

835
01:09:51,254 --> 01:09:52,578
On the other hand,

836
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:56,990
to be set free, it's not
always enough to be innocent.

837
01:10:00,611 --> 01:10:01,775
But I...

838
01:10:02,001 --> 01:10:03,721
Poor Blaireau, go.

839
01:10:05,131 --> 01:10:06,768
Bonbon?

840
01:10:47,798 --> 01:10:49,119
Yes, come in!

841
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:52,970
Ah, here you are, Fléchard!

842
01:10:53,872 --> 01:10:56,974
My compliments, eh!
What would you like?

843
01:10:57,105 --> 01:11:00,560
- I came to turn myself in to prison.
- Do you have papers?

844
01:11:00,612 --> 01:11:03,413
- No, Mr. Director.
- A word, a letter, from the prosecutor?

845
01:11:03,458 --> 01:11:04,766
No, nothing at all.

846
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:07,896
And you imagine I'll throw you in
the slammer just like that? For kicks?

847
01:11:07,937 --> 01:11:10,332
You astonish me, upon my word!

848
01:11:10,381 --> 01:11:12,596
You need a recommendation
to go to prison?

849
01:11:12,621 --> 01:11:14,005
Certainly!

850
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,777
It's still the old favoritism!

851
01:11:16,899 --> 01:11:17,927
- Yes!

852
01:11:18,544 --> 01:11:19,552
Mr. Director.

853
01:11:20,068 --> 01:11:21,716
What, now?

854
01:11:21,771 --> 01:11:24,394
I don't mean to reproach, Mr. Director,

855
01:11:24,441 --> 01:11:27,649
but I think you're taking
your time to release me.

856
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:30,691
Impossible, not before receiving
the prosecutor's order!

857
01:11:30,734 --> 01:11:33,163
So, not only did I serve
my time while being innocent

858
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:35,302
but you won't turn me loose!
Don't that beat all!

859
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:38,669
I can beat that, I'm guilty
but they won't arrest me!

860
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:41,404
If we put every guilty person
in prison, it'd never end!

861
01:11:41,429 --> 01:11:42,800
Pretty neat! Justice!
- No.

862
01:11:42,829 --> 01:11:45,466
- Will you shut up!
- No, I won't shut up. I want out!

863
01:11:45,546 --> 01:11:47,200
- I want in!
- I want out!

864
01:11:47,225 --> 01:11:48,271
ENOUGH!

865
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:51,725
- Victor! -Director?
- Throw Blaireau in the clink.

866
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:53,579
As for you, M. Fléchard, out!

867
01:11:56,814 --> 01:11:59,200
M. Bluette, I have to get in prison.

868
01:11:59,241 --> 01:12:00,247
No!

869
01:12:00,395 --> 01:12:02,450
I'll complain to the government!

870
01:12:02,475 --> 01:12:04,558
You're charming, but no!

871
01:12:04,591 --> 01:12:06,259
Look here...

872
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:07,966
No!

873
01:12:10,327 --> 01:12:11,867
No, no!

874
01:12:12,077 --> 01:12:14,666
I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!

It's excellent, this wine!

1051
01:24:33,383 --> 01:24:35,039
Taste it properly.

1052
01:24:39,714 --> 01:24:42,805
- Scrapes the throat, huh?
- A bit young, maybe.

1053
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:46,260
I know. Taste this one,
it's famous.

1054
01:24:50,221 --> 01:24:53,721
- It's very mediocre.
- Now taste yours, again.

1055
01:24:57,286 --> 01:25:00,433
- This one's excellent.
- OK, and this one.

1056
01:25:03,204 --> 01:25:05,895
- Lacks body.
- We agree.

1057
01:25:05,938 --> 01:25:07,372
This one...

1058
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:11,192
Now yours.

1059
01:25:12,912 --> 01:25:14,784
Excellent, wine!

1060
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,205
If you were a nice guy...

1061
01:25:27,276 --> 01:25:30,116
Listen... call me Léon.

1062
01:25:32,274 --> 01:25:34,011
If you were a nice guy, Léon...

1063
01:25:34,136 --> 01:25:37,389
I'm always a nice guy, Blaireau.

1064
01:25:38,518 --> 01:25:40,841
Alright, if Léon were a nice guy...

1065
01:25:40,904 --> 01:25:41,911
Yes.

1066
01:25:41,969 --> 01:25:46,021
you'd give me...
your daughter's hand

1067
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:49,783
Oh, I'll give it to you, Blaireau.

1068
01:25:50,256 --> 01:25:51,264
Fine!

1069
01:25:51,631 --> 01:25:53,177
But, not for me.

1070
01:25:53,265 --> 01:25:55,347
Ah, not for you?
- No.

1071
01:25:56,745 --> 01:25:58,016
For Fléchard

1072
01:25:58,608 --> 01:26:00,524
It's for Fléchard?

1073
01:26:00,829 --> 01:26:02,266
Whatever you do...

1074
01:26:02,305 --> 01:26:04,721
