Ed?

00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:59,121
Look, I'm twerkin', darling.
I'm twerkin'.

36
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:00,352
No, you're not.

37
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:02,037
Isn't that twerking?

38
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:03,801
No, move your bum.

39
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,402
Ooh.

Sweetheart, darling? Saff?

Your grandmother's home.

45
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:36,271
Darling! Sweetheart!
Darling! Sweetheart!

46
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,073
Darling!

47
00:02:57,387 --> 00:02:59,276
Wakey, wakey, my lady.

48
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,152
Oh, get out, get out.

49
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:05,152
You have meetings,
meetings, meetings...

50
00:03:05,427 --> 00:03:07,155
parties, openings.

51
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:11,307
Pats?

52
00:03:11,746 --> 00:03:13,350
Pats!
What?

53
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,951
Today's the day I sign the deal

54
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:16,426
on my book deal, darling.

55
00:03:16,826 --> 00:03:19,193
Oh! Fabulous.

56
00:03:19,426 --> 00:03:21,189
Yeah, fabulous.

57
00:03:21,425 --> 00:03:22,870
Am I in it?

58
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:24,994
Of course you're in it, darling,

59
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:28,035
because you are my oldest,
oldest friend.

60
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:29,106
Mmm-hmm.

61
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:32,312
And who will play me, Eddy?

62
00:03:32,905 --> 00:03:35,191
Well, darling, it's only
just nearly a book.

63
00:03:35,384 --> 00:03:36,760
It will be a film,
though, sweetheart,

64
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:38,115
because it's about me, isn't it?

65
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:42,025
It's about London's
premier fashion P.R.

66
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:44,305
Fabulous.

67
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:47,229
And who will play me, Eddy?
Not Jane Fonda.

68
00:03:47,784 --> 00:03:48,785
Why?

69
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:50,469
I've had stem cells

70
00:03:50,543 --> 00:03:52,033
and the blood of
a 2-year-old child

71
00:03:52,103 --> 00:03:54,231
injected in my skin
and I still look like this.

72
00:03:54,423 --> 00:03:56,505
You need to use
fetus blood, Eddy.

73
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:58,984
A little spritz
of afterbirth, darling.

74
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:01,066
Oh.
Keep up, sweetie.

75
00:04:04,023 --> 00:04:05,512
Oh!

76
00:04:05,782 --> 00:04:07,193
I want to go in there,

77
00:04:07,262 --> 00:04:08,946
but I have to get past
that big mirror.

78
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:11,868
I think I am now officially
fatter sideways

79
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:13,148
than I am front on.

80
00:04:13,342 --> 00:04:16,232
Darling, you don't need those.
Lam your mirror.

81
00:04:16,942 --> 00:04:18,228
How do I look?

82
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,070
Fabulous.
Thank you.

83
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:24,342
Ooh.

84
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:26,505
Need to move that, Eddy.

85
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:28,824
I'll call Kelly Hoppen.

86
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:30,462
Fabulous.

87
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:32,826
Morning.

88
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:34,386
Afternoon.

89
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,390
When did these
stairs get so long?

90
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,309
Since you dug into middle earth.

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,502
Oh, yes.
Good though, isn't it?

92
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,186
Bo and Marshall rang.

93
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,870
Both of them?

94
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,620
They want to come
and talk about the house.

95
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,868
Why do they want to talk
about the house?

96
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:50,380
I don't know.

97
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:52,069
Go outside!

98
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,499
Eddy, I'm vaping.

99
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:55,659
No, darling, you lit it,
that's a cigarette.

100
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,060
And she's a child.

101
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:59,580
Then why can't she
go outside into the air?

102
00:05:00,059 --> 00:05:01,868
Your mother's here.

103
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:03,299
Oh, Christ.

104
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:04,903
How long is this one here for?

105
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:06,059
When's she going back?

106
00:05:06,258 --> 00:05:07,258
I don't know.

107
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:09,266
All I know is it's something
else I'm paying for.

108
00:05:09,498 --> 00:05:11,068
I'm not going back to Africa.

109
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:13,061
If Dad wants to see me,
he can come here.

110
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:14,703
Why isn't he paying for her?

111
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:16,183
Mum, we're divorced.

112
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:18,261
Well, he can't just sit in Ebola

113
00:05:18,338 --> 00:05:21,181
or wherever he is, darling,
and not pay for her.

114
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:22,543
Gabon?

115
00:05:23,177 --> 00:05:24,303
What?

116
00:05:24,497 --> 00:05:25,862
Gabon?

117
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:29,018
Gabon?

118
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:31,339
Why is she...
Why are you saying Gabon?

119
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:33,107
Is he still in Gabon?

120
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:35,905
Is he still in Gabon?
No.

121
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:37,507
No! No.

122
00:05:37,896 --> 00:05:39,102
Dad's paying for me.

123
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:41,427
He gave me a credit card.

124
00:05:41,496 --> 00:05:43,066
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

125
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,417
Talking about
credit cards. Bubble?

126
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:49,895
All of my cards are broken.
Fix them, please.

127
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:52,666
Eddy, I'm thirsty.
Morning, Mrs. M.

128
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:54,904
Morning, Patsy, dear.

129
00:05:55,895 --> 00:05:57,226
I'll open a Bolly.

130
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:01,339
Darling, where is the champagne?

131
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:02,576
I don't know.

132
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:06,895
Where's the Bolly?
Where's the champagne?

133
00:06:07,054 --> 00:06:09,056
If you want things,
you have to pay for them.

134
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:10,454
Since when?

135
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:13,658
Sounds like you'll have to
tighten your belt, dear.

136
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:14,935
Oh.

137
00:06:15,214 --> 00:06:17,342
If you manage that,
it'll be a first.

138
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:20,140
Don't let her eat anything
while she's here.

139
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,453
All right? No eaty.

140
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:23,813
Eddy, what are we going
to do without champagne?

141
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:26,942
That'll be Bo and Marshall.

142
00:06:28,453 --> 00:06:29,500
Hi, hi, hi.

143
00:06:29,613 --> 00:06:30,614
Hello, there.

144
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,733
No need to rush, honey.
Be careful.

145
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:35,053
All of this is new.

146
00:06:35,372 --> 00:06:36,373
Hello, everybody.

147
00:06:36,492 --> 00:06:37,493
Oh, hello, there.

148
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:40,060
Let's get up here,
one, two, three.

149
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:42,933
Now tell her why we're here.

150
00:06:43,412 --> 00:06:46,302
I can't go on
with the house payments.

151
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:48,934
You paid for all this?
Yes.

152
00:06:49,171 --> 00:06:52,175
Well, darling, that's how
divorce works. Learn.

153
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,975
He needs surgery.

154
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:57,459
Yes. We can tell them.
Marshall is a transgender.

155
00:06:57,571 --> 00:06:59,255
He'd like to live as a woman.

156
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:02,414
Oh, that's typical.
Jumping on the bandwagon.

157
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,492
Finally she gets to
cut your balls off!

158
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,257
Oh, well, I don't need
your measly payments.

159
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,291
I've got a book deal.

160
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,741
Come on, Pats.

161
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,094
At least you're small.
You'll be able to get shoes.

162
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,651
So when does it come off?

163
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:22,292
Oh, we haven't gone through
"coming off" therapy yet.

164
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:24,734
Darling, come with me today.

165
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:26,329
I'm putting
the final touches to...

166
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,736
the Huki Muki
retrospective launch party.

167
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:30,654
No. Can Lulu sing at that?

168
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:33,769
Oh, no, no,
that all has to go back.

169
00:07:34,048 --> 00:07:35,288
That's all got to go back.

170
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:37,292
Eddy, how long
have we got this for?

171
00:07:37,448 --> 00:07:39,337
Oh, they've lent it
for Emma Bunton,

172
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:40,455
but they don't mind.

173
00:07:40,648 --> 00:07:42,298
No, they want it back.

174
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:45,139
Exercise, exercise,
exercise... done!

175
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,103
<i>And coming up on "Woman's Hour",</i>

176
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:50,289
<i>was Shakespeare's
wife depressed?</i>

177
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:52,331
<i>But first, here in
the studio we have</i>

178
00:07:52,407 --> 00:07:55,138
<i>PR. supremo Claudia Bing,
a woman...</i>

179
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:56,543
<i>with her finger on the pulse.</i>

180
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:58,456
Oh, turn that shit off.

181
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:02,372
There was a time the
zeitgeist blew through me.

182
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,330
Now it's just...

183
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:06,773
A tiny fart.

184
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:09,767
Eddy, look.

185
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,533
Quite close by.
Ooh.

186
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:14,571
No, I'm all right.

187
00:08:15,726 --> 00:08:18,296
Had him, had him,
had him, had him.

188
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:22,567
Eddy, can we stop
at the Wolseley?

189
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:25,173
No, darling,
my cards are broken.

190
00:08:26,045 --> 00:08:27,331
Chiltern Firehouse?

191
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:29,613
My cards are broken!

192
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,728
Well, haven't you got
any of that...

193
00:08:35,324 --> 00:08:36,610
hand money?

194
00:08:37,044 --> 00:08:38,330
No.

195
00:08:44,044 --> 00:08:45,170
What is that?

196
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:46,809
Chanel No. 5.

197
00:08:47,203 --> 00:08:48,614
No, I'm all right.

198
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:53,092
Show them your breasts.
No.

199
00:08:53,363 --> 00:08:55,092
Oh, come on.
Leave it, Bo.

200
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:57,524
Women, can't live with 'em,
can't...

201
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,085
Is this little Lola?

202
00:09:00,203 --> 00:09:01,442
On.

203
00:09:01,522 --> 00:09:02,523
Africa.

204
00:09:03,082 --> 00:09:05,767
We are sisters.
My people are your people.

205
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:07,363
Which people?

206
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:10,082
Black people.
Lam a black person.

207
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:13,648
Deep down, we are all black.

208
00:09:13,722 --> 00:09:14,723
Oh!

209
00:09:24,761 --> 00:09:28,243
So, can I have an advance?

210
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,643
No. What is this?
I just don't get it.

211
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,166
Well, this isn't how
it would be written.

212
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,402
This is how
I dictated it to Bubble.

213
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,645
Bubble. What is Bubble?

214
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,560
My P.A., Bubble.

215
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,448
Oh, I thought
it was new software.

216
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,359
You see, I'm just not
really understanding

217
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:51,203
anything you say.

218
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,408
I need a coffee.

219
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,120
Coffee!

220
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:58,690
I mean, the world of P.R. Mmm.

221
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,324
Who really knows
what P.R. is?

222
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:04,243
P.R. is everything.
Lam P.R.

223
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,162
I took Sting and
put him in the rainforest,

224
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:07,803
gave the little pygmies a party.

225
00:10:08,238 --> 00:10:10,400
I put Bono behind
yellow glasses.

226
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:11,889
I gave celebrities AIDS.

227
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:15,447
The T-shirt.

228
00:10:15,677 --> 00:10:17,441
Anyway, look...

229
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:19,441
there's not enough here.

230
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:22,438
What do you mean, not enough?

231
00:10:22,517 --> 00:10:25,839
There's pages and pages.
I dictated it to Bubble.

232
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:30,166
It mostly just says,
"Blah, blah, blah."

233
00:10:34,596 --> 00:10:36,564
Who do you
represent in P.R.?

234
00:10:37,716 --> 00:10:39,923
Well, it's not just the "who's",

235
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:42,477
it's the "what's".
It's the likes of...

236
00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:44,842
Not the "likes of",
the "actuals".

237
00:10:46,835 --> 00:10:48,166
The singer Lulu.

238
00:10:48,715 --> 00:10:49,921
Who else?

239
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:53,720
Spice Emma, Baby Bunton.

240
00:10:54,315 --> 00:10:55,476
And?

241
00:10:57,195 --> 00:10:58,196
Queen Noor.

242
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:03,315
I have a huge boutique vodka.
I have Pop-Specs.

243
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:05,195
Joel.

244
00:11:05,954 --> 00:11:08,844
Graham! Graham, I know you.
I know him.

245
00:11:09,194 --> 00:11:10,195
He loves me.

246
00:11:10,394 --> 00:11:11,964
I don't love you.
You're gay, come on.

247
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:14,884
I don't love you!
Leave me alone.

248
00:11:15,273 --> 00:11:16,877
I don't know
what's wrong with him.

249
00:11:17,673 --> 00:11:18,879
All my friends are gay.

250
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:22,524
And Nigella!
Yes. I know Nigella.

251
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:25,324
Write a chapter on that.
Me and Nigella...

252
00:11:25,553 --> 00:11:28,203
eating late at night...
in a fridge.

253
00:11:28,432 --> 00:11:29,433
No.

254
00:11:30,512 --> 00:11:32,514
Can I have an advance?
No.

255
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:33,673
Why?

256
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:34,879
Because it's shit.

257
00:11:36,672 --> 00:11:37,958
Eddy, let's go.

258
00:11:38,512 --> 00:11:39,513
I'll be late.

259
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:45,913
You only read 'em.
You don't write 'em.

260
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:49,639
You just work in the shop.

261
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:52,997
You think your life's
interesting. It isn't.

262
00:11:53,911 --> 00:11:56,721
It may be worth living,
but it's not worth reading.

263
00:11:57,511 --> 00:12:00,559
It's happened. Move on.

264
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,872
Bloody, bloody books!
Bloody books!

265
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,918
Blah, blah, blah!
Bloody books!

266
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,479
I have to check the Huki Muki
mannequins before tonight.

267
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:16,278
Coming with me, Eds?

268
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:17,350
No, I can't.

269
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:20,873
I've got that P.R. persons
lunch-of-the-month lunch.

270
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:22,270
Brunch.

271
00:12:22,469 --> 00:12:24,358
A munch-of-the-munch munch?

272
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:25,960
Not munch. Lunch.

273
00:12:26,349 --> 00:12:27,588
Oh, kill her, Eddy.

274
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:28,948
What are we going to?

275
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,524
Have you rung Lulu yet?

276
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:32,038
Oh, shut up about Lulu.

277
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:33,474
Don't rush me.

278
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:36,311
I haven't got any money.

279
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,356
Get someone to pay
at the other end.

280
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:40,318
Where's my car?

281
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:41,958
It's gone back to Baby Bunton.

282
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:43,348
But I need wheels!

283
00:12:43,507 --> 00:12:44,508
Oh!

284
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:47,597
But you were only given feet.

285
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:48,908
Oh, shut up.

286
00:12:58,706 --> 00:13:01,312
Yeah. Love. Love.

287
00:13:01,706 --> 00:13:02,707
Hate.

288
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:04,670
Put the fishtail
next to the red blob.

289
00:13:04,746 --> 00:13:06,635
And change that mannequin,
it's too fat.

290
00:13:06,826 --> 00:13:08,316
Why are we doing this
by the river?

291
00:13:08,386 --> 00:13:09,751
It stinks of fish.

292
00:13:09,986 --> 00:13:11,714
Is that you? Good grief.

293
00:13:11,945 --> 00:13:13,788
What's the food?
Oh, raw.

294
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:15,241
Freshly dead,
octopus with a pulse?

295
00:13:15,265 --> 00:13:16,265
Yeah.

296
00:13:16,305 --> 00:13:17,306
Cocktails?

297
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:18,950
The mixologist is Madeira Slice.

298
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:22,393
He's doing his flaming gasoline
herbal labia cocktails.

299
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,956
No olives.
No.

300
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:25,875
Oh, Metro wants a paragraph.

301
00:13:26,065 --> 00:13:28,431
Oh, Patsy Stone,
fashion editor, The A.

302
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:30,547
Fashion designer Huki Muki

303
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:32,626
makes Valentino
look like Topshop.

304
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:35,026
Disorientating beauty juxtaposed

305
00:13:35,104 --> 00:13:37,345
between life and death...
and shoes.

306
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:40,025
Yeah, all that shit,
but more importantly,

307
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:41,747
our magazine is sponsoring it.

308
00:13:41,983 --> 00:13:43,985
I want Huki Muki smaller,
our logo bigger.

309
00:13:44,103 --> 00:13:45,468
Yeah, Magda.

310
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:48,349
Oi, Pats. I've just
been with Valentino.

311
00:13:48,623 --> 00:13:49,624
What's left of him?

312
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:51,706
Not much. He's a small
lizard handbag

313
00:13:51,783 --> 00:13:53,114
with a hoverboard of hair.

314
00:13:54,903 --> 00:13:56,392
Shut up!
Ooh!

315
00:13:57,342 --> 00:13:58,912
Guest list, now.
Right.

316
00:13:59,102 --> 00:14:03,824
Okay, we have got
all the Jenners and Tyga...

317
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:06,502
Suki, Cara, David...

318
00:14:06,782 --> 00:14:10,786
Kanye. We have Dolce,
but not Gabbana. Okay.

319
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:13,422
SamCam, I don't know who...

320
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:15,788
Ai Wuhwuh... Ai Weiwuh...
Weiwie...

321
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:17,507
Am I going deaf

322
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:19,663
or have you not said
"Kate Moss" yet?

323
00:14:19,821 --> 00:14:21,186
Apart from the fact

324
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:22,707
me head's full of fish fumes...

325
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:25,142
it's impossible because
she's left her P.R.

326
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,220
I shouldn't have said that,
it's secret.

327
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,660
Delete, delete.

328
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,822
I don't care.
Just get her here.

329
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,586
Offer her ayahuasca and shamans

330
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,389
and enough vodka to kill cattle.

331
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,868
I'm off to Chanel.
Lagerfeld waits for no man.

332
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,823
Get me an Uber.
A minicab?

333
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:45,865
Helicopter!
I don't do traffic!

334
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:47,745
Bag.

335
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:49,509
Chanel, Chanel!

336
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:51,149
I can't bloody
work with that shit!

337
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,026
<i>Welcome,
everybody, to this month's</i>

338
00:14:57,098 --> 00:14:59,419
<i>P.R. person-of-the-month
lunch.</i>

339
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:02,823
Eat. It's all free.

340
00:15:03,418 --> 00:15:07,423
Nothing is free anymore.
Even freedom isn't free.

341
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,029
It used to be.

342
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:10,986
But now everybody wants
your PIN number.

343
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:14,067
Sure they do, old girl.
Sure they do.

344
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:15,418
Say nothing.

345
00:15:15,617 --> 00:15:16,743
Edina.

346
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:18,057
Claudia.

347
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:19,542
I hear you've just been
to a meeting

348
00:15:19,617 --> 00:15:22,348
with my friend Joel
at Random Penguin.

349
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:23,457
Yeah, it went really well.

350
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,865
He said how it went.

351
00:15:26,096 --> 00:15:28,542
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, Claudia Bing.</i>

352
00:15:28,736 --> 00:15:33,185
Thank you, guys. So proud
to be yet again...

353
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:37,058
the P.R. person's
P.R. person of the month.

354
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:41,103
We will continue
to run campaigns...

355
00:15:41,535 --> 00:15:43,902
with the...
"sergeny"?

356
00:15:44,095 --> 00:15:45,301
Synergy-

357
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:46,576
Oh, synergy.

358
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:48,545
Shooting up and...
Out.

359
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:52,465
Out.
Shooting out on Twitter...

360
00:15:52,655 --> 00:15:55,658
and joining up
all those conversations.

361
00:15:55,894 --> 00:15:58,022
Do we do that?
No.

362
00:15:58,454 --> 00:16:03,460
Who knew that a blog post could do more
than a banner or cookie engagement?

363
00:16:03,694 --> 00:16:05,219
Do you feed my Twitter?

364
00:16:05,574 --> 00:16:08,783
No, I forgot. And it died.

365
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:18,936
These days, you can't get by

366
00:16:19,013 --> 00:16:21,744
with a couple of old
pop stars and a vodka.

367
00:16:22,893 --> 00:16:26,499
It's a boutique vodka!
It's a huge boutique vodka!

368
00:16:29,892 --> 00:16:32,099
<i>Eddy! Top secret, darling.</i>

369
00:16:32,172 --> 00:16:33,503
<i>You don't know this...</i>

370
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,172
and I don't know this,
but, darling...

371
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:38,501
<i>Kate Moss
is changing her P.R.!</i>

372
00:16:40,931 --> 00:16:42,501
<i>Darling? Kate Moss!</i>

373
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:44,136
Oh, shut up! Stop!

374
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:45,697
<i>Eds, darling,</i>

375
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:48,615
<i>she's going to be
at the Huki Muki.</i>

376
00:16:48,811 --> 00:16:50,495
Shut up! Shut up!

377
00:16:50,731 --> 00:16:51,812
<i>No one else will know.</i>

378
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:53,256
<i>Don't let that bitch Bing know.</i>

379
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,051
Damn!

380
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,934
So common.

381
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,251
Ooh!

382
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,651
<i>Lola!</i>

383
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,932
Lola!
What?

384
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:09,739
Have you seen Gran?

385
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:16,811
Hi.
Hi. Hi.

386
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:21,330
Oh.

387
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:24,173
Um, are you okay?
You seem a bit flustered.

388
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:25,978
Yeah, uh, no. Uh...

389
00:17:26,168 --> 00:17:28,409
I just need to see Gran
off to the airport.

390
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:30,850
My mother's looking after
Lola tonight.

391
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,692
Should I meet your mother? No.

392
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,209
Okay.

393
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:36,338
Sorry.
It's fine.

394
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,087
Can I kiss you properly now?

395
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,010
I've been
thinking about it all day.

396
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:42,371
Sorry.

397
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:47,452
Oh, my God.

398
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:49,212
I can't believe that face

399
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:51,130
came from the womb
of the little dumpster.

400
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:52,374
Excuse me?

401
00:17:52,686 --> 00:17:55,132
Tonight, Lola, you are
my perfect accessory.

402
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:57,214
Oh, she won't need
much, darling.

403
00:17:57,366 --> 00:17:59,175
If raw material
was the finished article,

404
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:00,896
there'd be no point of me.

405
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:03,014
I'm going to straighten
and shimmer.

406
00:18:03,206 --> 00:18:04,253
Ow! Ow!
Go for it.

407
00:18:04,446 --> 00:18:07,131
Just take the pain, bitch.
Your hair will straighten.

408
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:08,205
Ow!

409
00:18:08,245 --> 00:18:10,213
Beyoncé cried, too,
but she surrendered.

410
00:18:10,285 --> 00:18:11,286
Ow!

411
00:18:15,045 --> 00:18:16,206
Don't stop.

412
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:19,892
There's something
in the suitcase?

413
00:18:27,284 --> 00:18:29,013
Where am I?

414
00:18:29,244 --> 00:18:30,484
Oh, Gran!

415
00:18:32,004 --> 00:18:33,051
What's she doing?

416
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:35,087
I'm off to Cannes, dear.

417
00:18:35,284 --> 00:18:37,889
She's going to Aunt
Violet's birthday party.

418
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,414
Why don't I know about this?

419
00:18:39,803 --> 00:18:42,124
We didn't want you
to know, dear.

420
00:18:42,203 --> 00:18:44,331
It's going to be very sprauncy.

421
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:45,928
Oh!

422
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:49,047
No, no, leave it!
It's Pats. Patsy.

423
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:51,813
Hi, darling.

424
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,058
Got some threads for the midget.

425
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:54,243
Leave them there.

426
00:18:54,402 --> 00:18:57,292
Oh, I smell pigs, Eddy.
I smell rozzers.

427
00:18:58,042 --> 00:19:01,763
Oh, just a thought. Will I
need injections, Saffy?

428
00:19:01,962 --> 00:19:03,168
Yeah, lethal ones.

429
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:04,973
Bonjour.

430
00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:07,047
You just met my mother.

431
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:10,331
She seems nice.

432
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:13,248
Look up.

433
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:14,766
Okay, I'm looking up.

434
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:17,886
Patsy's here.

435
00:19:17,961 --> 00:19:19,042
Ugh.

436
00:19:19,121 --> 00:19:21,044
Darling, it's pretty
exciting, isn't it?

437
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:22,963
Tonight is going to
change everything.

438
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,123
Oh, my God, what's happening?

439
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,205
No, Eddy.
What?

440
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,322
I'm going to...
Don't tell him, Eddy.

441
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,081
Tell him, Eddy.

442
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,120
I'm gonna get Kate Moss!
I'm her new P.R.!

443
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:43,208
Go on, go to Patsy.

444
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:53,242
We all love you.

445
00:19:53,478 --> 00:19:55,128
We love you.
We love you.

446
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:58,003
We thought we'd go to Goa
for an Ayurvedic colonic.

447
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,967
It's totes amaze.
So beautiful.

448
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:02,365
Edina has to come.
She has to.

449
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,961
Or we could go out.

450
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,448
There's that new club,
FoFo BoBo.

451
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:08,601
Who's D.J.-ing?
Dead Mice.

452
00:20:09,997 --> 00:20:11,840
I love Dead Mice.

453
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:14,119
Oh, Edina, you have to come.

454
00:20:14,317 --> 00:20:16,319
Stella will give you
all the clothes you need.

455
00:20:16,837 --> 00:20:19,044
I would love to dress you.

456
00:20:19,837 --> 00:20:21,122
On, Eddy...

457
00:20:21,356 --> 00:20:23,518
you're my favorite person
in the whole world.

458
00:20:23,596 --> 00:20:25,519
You have to do my P.R.

459
00:20:25,796 --> 00:20:27,400
Please, you have to.

460
00:20:28,236 --> 00:20:29,522
Please?
Okay, okay.

461
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,407
Eddy! Eddy! Eddy!

462
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:43,520
What are those?
I'm not wearing them!

463
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:47,596
Pats! Will you just let her
wear what she wants?

464
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:50,084
Can I do Kate's hair?

465
00:20:50,154 --> 00:20:52,043
I'd love to give her ends
a good tonging.

466
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:53,195
Yes.

467
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:55,925
She's going to love you, Lola.

468
00:20:55,994 --> 00:20:57,041
Why?

469
00:20:57,154 --> 00:20:58,485
'Cause you have
what we all want.

470
00:20:58,594 --> 00:20:59,959
Eddy, look.

471
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:03,159
Youth patch. Absorb, absorb.

472
00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:05,194
Now, listen.

473
00:21:05,273 --> 00:21:07,073
You're coming as my
daughter, so all you do...

474
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:09,037
I'm not going to be man bait.

475
00:21:09,193 --> 00:21:10,877
You should be so lucky.

476
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:15,398
What are you doing?

477
00:21:16,313 --> 00:21:19,044
I'm going. I want to go.

478
00:21:19,233 --> 00:21:20,792
Kate Moss will be there
and Eddy said...

479
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:23,192
What?

480
00:21:25,312 --> 00:21:28,202
Are you sexing that little
rodent downstairs, darling?

481
00:21:29,072 --> 00:21:31,439
You know what?
Fine. Fuck it.

482
00:21:31,912 --> 00:21:33,437
Sorry. Fuck. Fuck!

483
00:21:33,912 --> 00:21:35,436
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

484
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:36,632
Fuck it!

485
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:40,119
I am going out.
Do what you want.

486
00:21:40,191 --> 00:21:41,920
You can do what you want.

487
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:43,920
Just don't do it to get at me.

488
00:21:44,111 --> 00:21:46,352
I ruined my life by trying
not to make my mother happy.

489
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,597
Don't do the same.

490
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,558
You wearing Stella
McCartney tonight, Eds?

491
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,911
Uh, no, darling, no.

492
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:08,115
She still won't let me
in her shop.

493
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:12,634
I'm here on the red carpet

494
00:22:12,709 --> 00:22:14,359
of the Huki Muki
retrospective...

495
00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:16,591
with London's
fashion glitterati.

496
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:19,588
If you're not here,
then who the hell are you?

497
00:22:25,348 --> 00:22:26,634
You're singing tonight, Lulu.

498
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,473
Yeah. It's going to be a great
crowd in there. I'm excited.

499
00:22:29,628 --> 00:22:32,632
Jerry, you look ravishing.
What are you wearing?

500
00:22:33,108 --> 00:22:34,597
Well, Richard,
I'm wearing a dress

501
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,635
that was given to me by Chanel.

502
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:38,996
As you can see, it's beautiful.

503
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,717
I have lots of their dresses.

504
00:22:43,387 --> 00:22:45,515
Magda, is it possible...
No.

505
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:51,156
Gwendoline? Gwendoline?

506
00:22:51,306 --> 00:22:52,637
How are you?

507
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:54,346
You're really tall.
Well spotted.

508
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:58,992
It's just I was speaking to
Lulu and she's quite small.

509
00:22:59,146 --> 00:23:00,147
Great.

510
00:23:00,386 --> 00:23:01,672
Last ones, please.

511
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:05,069
Good grief. Oh, Christ, love,
we can see your bumhole.

512
00:23:05,145 --> 00:23:06,146
This way.

513
00:23:06,265 --> 00:23:07,994
Do you think
Kate's already here?

514
00:23:08,065 --> 00:23:09,226
Hiya, hiya, hiya.

515
00:23:09,545 --> 00:23:11,547
Where's Kate?
Darling, just be cool.

516
00:23:11,745 --> 00:23:14,351
I am cool, darling.
I am cool.

517
00:23:14,665 --> 00:23:16,986
Oh, shit! Lulu.
Forgot to ring her.

518
00:23:17,305 --> 00:23:19,432
What'll I tell Lulu?

519
00:23:19,544 --> 00:23:21,751
Oi! You're not wearing
my clothes, are you?

520
00:23:22,184 --> 00:23:23,265
No, darling, no.

521
00:23:23,344 --> 00:23:25,551
This is all T.K. Maxx.
T.K. Maxx.

522
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,749
I can't stand that woman.

523
00:23:28,184 --> 00:23:30,186
Let it go. Just breathe.

524
00:23:30,424 --> 00:23:31,425
Stella, darling.

525
00:23:32,623 --> 00:23:35,024
Is your father with you?
Is little Pauly with you?

526
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:36,754
No.
Oh, that's a shame.

527
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:39,063
I was hoping to have
a little catch-up with him.

528
00:23:39,103 --> 00:23:42,186
I haven't seen him since
1969, know what I mean?

529
00:23:42,503 --> 00:23:45,188
Ugh, God, and the world
blamed Yoko.

530
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:49,428
My shoes I just adore.
So comfortable.

531
00:23:49,702 --> 00:23:51,625
They're also made by Chanel.

532
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:54,308
And are made
of really soft leather.

533
00:23:55,662 --> 00:23:57,471
Huki Muki!

534
00:23:59,102 --> 00:24:00,467
I need to piss.

535
00:24:00,662 --> 00:24:01,709
Huki! Huki!

536
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:05,589
Just a word, please!
Huki! Huki Muki!

537
00:24:07,341 --> 00:24:08,672
Sorry, Huki won't speak.

538
00:24:09,061 --> 00:24:12,065
Why do you think there's
been a Huki Muki revival?

539
00:24:12,261 --> 00:24:16,152
It's about blobs.
Great big blobs of color.

540
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:18,229
But why now?

541
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,225
It's simply that we're
ready to see it again.

542
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,144
Thank you very much.

543
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,063
Claudia Bing,
an incredible woman.

544
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,343
You know, Richard, you really
can't go wrong with Chanel.

545
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,105
I've been a big fan of Karl's

546
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,228
for so many years,
and I love what he does.

547
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:34,500
And glasses off.

548
00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:36,590
And glasses on again, darling.

549
00:24:37,219 --> 00:24:39,381
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, La Roux!</i>

550
00:24:39,459 --> 00:24:41,268
<i>He wants to know</i>

551
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:43,383
<i>What it feels like</i>

552
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:45,183
Excuse me.

553
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:48,227
Just looking for my mate, Kate.

554
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:51,507
<i>She wants to know
What it feels like</i>

555
00:24:51,738 --> 00:24:54,662
<i>To settle down Settle down</i>

556
00:24:55,658 --> 00:24:56,819
<i>He's got the money</i>

557
00:24:57,098 --> 00:25:00,181
Have you seen Kate Moss?
Just looking for Kate.

558
00:25:00,378 --> 00:25:01,788
<i>He wants to pounce</i>

559
00:25:02,177 --> 00:25:03,178
You're joking.

560
00:25:03,257 --> 00:25:04,257
<i>He wants to pounce</i>

561
00:25:04,297 --> 00:25:05,787
<i>Never know if he's giving you up</i>

562
00:25:06,097 --> 00:25:07,781
<i>Are you just not good enough</i>

563
00:25:08,097 --> 00:25:10,259
Lulu, I thought
you were singing tonight.

564
00:25:10,537 --> 00:25:11,868
That's what I was told.

565
00:25:12,257 --> 00:25:14,544
She's done this
to me before as well.

566
00:25:14,697 --> 00:25:15,698
Oi!

567
00:25:15,777 --> 00:25:18,780
You. You told Lulu
this was her gig.

568
00:25:19,776 --> 00:25:21,696
You know what, darling?
It is, 'cause afterwards,

569
00:25:21,736 --> 00:25:24,785
they said you can sing
"Shout". Accapeli.

570
00:25:28,656 --> 00:25:31,135
I will bloody murder her.

571
00:25:31,335 --> 00:25:33,542
Has anyone seen Kate?
I'm supposed to meet her.

572
00:25:34,415 --> 00:25:36,383
Get me half a Bass
in a straight glass,

573
00:25:36,455 --> 00:25:38,662
and something to eat,
but nothing with tentacles.

574
00:25:39,135 --> 00:25:40,705
And none of that
dim sum bollocks.

575
00:25:40,815 --> 00:25:41,816
Get me a sandwich.

576
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:46,619
<i>He wants to know</i>

577
00:25:47,694 --> 00:25:48,900
Kelly Hoppen.

578
00:25:49,134 --> 00:25:50,579
What's your take
on all this color?

579
00:25:50,814 --> 00:25:52,782
To be honest,
it's doing my head in.

580
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,580
Eddy, little Kate
is on the balcony.

581
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:56,934
She's out there, darling!

582
00:25:57,294 --> 00:25:59,456
Oh, Lola, Lola, follow, follow.

583
00:26:06,653 --> 00:26:07,654
Sweetie!

584
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,698
It's Brienne of Tarth...

585
00:26:09,813 --> 00:26:11,702
Lola, come here!

586
00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:13,577
Are you okay?

587
00:26:13,813 --> 00:26:16,782
I just have
this nightmare P.R.

588
00:26:17,172 --> 00:26:19,573
Oh, I got rid of mine.
Good for you.

589
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:22,736
Eddy, I'm going to
roll away the Hamm.

590
00:26:22,852 --> 00:26:24,183
All right, darling.

591
00:26:24,372 --> 00:26:25,428
I don't even know what they do.

592
00:26:25,452 --> 00:26:26,453
Who does?

593
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:28,342
Oh, watch out.

594
00:26:28,572 --> 00:26:30,858
Hi, Jonny. Patsy. Stone.

595
00:26:31,331 --> 00:26:32,332
Patsy.

596
00:26:32,731 --> 00:26:34,859
Hamm. Jon. Hamm.

597
00:26:35,331 --> 00:26:36,856
Don't you remember me, Jonny?

598
00:26:37,491 --> 00:26:38,492
No.

599
00:26:38,691 --> 00:26:40,455
Jonny Jonny from the Big Apple

600
00:26:40,531 --> 00:26:42,932
needing a little taste
of the English rose?

601
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:45,936
Oh, God.

602
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,850
Yes, I do. I was fifteen.

603
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,666
But you were a very
big fifteen, sweetheart.

604
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,737
Oh, God.

605
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:55,730
I want you to go over there
and talk to her casually.

606
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:56,931
And then what?

607
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,735
Then I'll come over and join you

608
00:26:58,810 --> 00:26:59,929
and she'll think I'm cool...

609
00:27:00,289 --> 00:27:02,690
and before you know it,
I'll be doing her P.R.

610
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:04,300
That's the plan?
Yeah.

611
00:27:04,489 --> 00:27:05,615
Jesus.

612
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:09,530
I can't believe
you're still, uh...

613
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:11,860
alive.

614
00:27:12,209 --> 00:27:13,779
No. Can I offer you a taste now?

615
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:15,458
Oh, come on, Jonny, come on.

616
00:27:15,568 --> 00:27:16,899
No, thank you.

617
00:27:17,568 --> 00:27:20,856
You took my virginity.
Please leave me my...

618
00:27:21,648 --> 00:27:22,854
sanity.

619
00:27:22,928 --> 00:27:23,929
Good luck.

620
00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:25,498
Jonny. Hi, Kate, sweetie.

621
00:27:25,848 --> 00:27:26,974
Jonny? Jonny?

622
00:27:27,448 --> 00:27:29,529
Okay, go, go, go!

623
00:27:29,887 --> 00:27:32,254
Talk to her. Big me up.

624
00:27:40,527 --> 00:27:42,131
Yes, yes. Smoke, smoke.

625
00:27:43,527 --> 00:27:44,766
Smoke.

626
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:57,695
Kate? Claudia Bing.

627
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,370
Edina Monsoon!
Oh!

628
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:06,886
Kate!

629
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:12,005
Why did you do that?

630
00:28:12,085 --> 00:28:13,290
She fell.

631
00:28:13,684 --> 00:28:15,573
You pushed her.
No, she fell!

632
00:28:15,804 --> 00:28:17,454
I saw you!

633
00:28:17,684 --> 00:28:19,573
Kate Moss has been pushed!

634
00:28:22,684 --> 00:28:24,448
Kate! Kate!

635
00:28:24,684 --> 00:28:26,368
Kate Moss!

636
00:28:26,484 --> 00:28:29,054
Hold on. I'll go in!

637
00:28:29,483 --> 00:28:32,453
You are not going in!
Put your jacket back on!

638
00:28:32,723 --> 00:28:33,770
Eddy!

639
00:28:33,843 --> 00:28:35,652
She'll pop up!
It's only water!

640
00:28:36,963 --> 00:28:39,967
It's just water,
why isn't she popping up?

641
00:28:40,643 --> 00:28:41,929
Why did you do this?

642
00:28:42,283 --> 00:28:44,284
I didn't do it!
She just fell!

643
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,729
Eddy, this is my party!

644
00:28:49,722 --> 00:28:51,486
I have a limp and
I don't know why.

645
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:52,803
Get them all down.

646
00:28:52,882 --> 00:28:54,646
I don't want to see
anything on camera.

647
00:28:54,842 --> 00:28:56,122
Right, the only thing is... Now!

648
00:28:56,962 --> 00:29:01,011
I fucking hate parties.
I fucking hate handbags!

649
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:04,605
Me leg. Good Lord.

650
00:29:04,841 --> 00:29:06,252
Magda! Selfie!

651
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:07,322
Fuck off!

652
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:08,887
Get them off.

653
00:29:09,321 --> 00:29:12,767
That woman has
always been out of control.

654
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,330
Kate was trying
to get away from her.

655
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,807
I was shocked.
I saw it happen.

656
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,006
She was pushed.

657
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,762
Did I miss something?

658
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,527
<i>This is the scene
where just a few hours ago...</i>

659
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,000
celebrated international
model Kate Moss...

660
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:32,967
fell or was pushed from
a balcony into the Thames.

661
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:35,521
Since then, emergency
services have been

662
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:38,000
struggling to cope
with the aftermath.

663
00:29:44,358 --> 00:29:46,042
It's my little toe.

664
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,119
She fell off her shoe.

665
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:49,563
Looking for Kate!

666
00:29:49,678 --> 00:29:53,046
Get back. One more dance.
Baby, please.

667
00:29:53,518 --> 00:29:56,488
I'm okay.
I didn't fall in the river.

668
00:30:33,675 --> 00:30:35,165
Shut up!
You shut up!

669
00:30:37,555 --> 00:30:39,762
How bad can this be?
I mean, you know.

670
00:30:39,955 --> 00:30:42,719
You have probably
killed Kate Moss.

671
00:30:44,714 --> 00:30:45,954
Shit.

672
00:30:47,594 --> 00:30:48,925
Spoilt your night out?

673
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:50,915
That doesn't matter.

674
00:30:51,754 --> 00:30:52,915
I shouldn't have let you go.

675
00:30:52,994 --> 00:30:54,837
I don't know
what I was thinking.

676
00:30:55,594 --> 00:30:57,083
She'll be all right, won't she?

677
00:30:57,593 --> 00:30:59,755
Kate, she's waterproof.

678
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:02,598
That's what we always say
about Kate, she's waterproof.

679
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:04,844
I demand to see your superior!

680
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,723
That would be me.
Nick?

681
00:31:06,913 --> 00:31:08,209
This is
Detective Inspector Nick...

682
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,439
We know each other, thank you.

683
00:31:09,513 --> 00:31:10,514
God.

684
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:11,753
Don't.

685
00:31:12,952 --> 00:31:15,796
Hello, hello?
Have they found Kate?

686
00:31:15,992 --> 00:31:17,756
No. The currents
are very strong.

687
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:18,993
Only an outside chance...

688
00:31:19,432 --> 00:31:21,514
Thank you. She will
either have drowned

689
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:24,442
or just be very, very wet.

690
00:31:25,432 --> 00:31:26,557
In the meantime,

691
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:27,996
you're here for your own safety.

692
00:31:28,191 --> 00:31:31,081
There's a very well-coordinated
lynch mob outside.

693
00:31:32,071 --> 00:31:33,072
What happens now?

694
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:35,121
This doesn't change
anything between us.

695
00:31:35,631 --> 00:31:36,962
No, about this.

696
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:39,520
Oh. I have witnesses

697
00:31:39,591 --> 00:31:42,070
to say that your mother
pushed her.

698
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,551
No!

699
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:45,756
I didn't want her to die.

700
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,158
She needed her.
Loved her!

701
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,726
We don't know
that she's dead yet.

702
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,036
Or that it's murder.

703
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,639
Murder?
Thank you.

704
00:31:55,349 --> 00:31:56,829
Manslaughter charges
might be brought.

705
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,631
Sorry.

706
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:07,909
Oh, God.

707
00:32:19,788 --> 00:32:21,836
Police continue to
search the Thames

708
00:32:21,908 --> 00:32:24,036
after fashion icon Kate Moss...

709
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:26,077
fell from a balcony.

710
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:33,070
There is a real sense of
devastation. Local people...

711
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:36,589
<i>friends, eyewitnesses
are in disbelief.</i>

712
00:32:36,827 --> 00:32:39,273
<i>They are reluctant to leave
the banks of the Thames</i>

713
00:32:39,347 --> 00:32:41,713
<i>while any faint hope remains...</i>

714
00:32:41,946 --> 00:32:43,835
of <i>Kate Moss being found alive.</i>

715
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:47,195
<i>We're expecting the police
to hold a news conference...</i>

716
00:32:47,706 --> 00:32:49,117
to <i>give us
the latest information</i>

717

<i>they have about the incident.</i>

718
00:32:51,146 --> 00:32:52,875
Now back to the studio.

719
00:32:53,066 --> 00:32:54,635
Some breaking news...

720
00:32:54,705 --> 00:32:57,549
P.R. guru Edina Monsoon,

723
00:33:02,025 --> 00:33:04,187
Don't drive off
until I'm in the house!

724
00:33:06,865 --> 00:33:08,355
Oi! Oi!

725
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,230
Stop hounding me!
I'm not an animal!

726
00:33:18,104 --> 00:33:19,993
<i>She was, like, someone</i>

727
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,226
<i>that I really looked up to.</i>

728
00:33:22,624 --> 00:33:24,143
<i>She wouldn't give a fuck
what we think.</i>

729
00:33:24,183 --> 00:33:25,344
<i>No!</i>

730
00:33:25,743 --> 00:33:27,029
<i>Devastated.
I'm so confused.</i>

731
00:33:27,223 --> 00:33:29,874
<i>Is there really nothing else
happening in the world?</i>

732
00:33:30,063 --> 00:33:31,110
<i>Fashion is dead.</i>

733
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,624
Oh! Oh!

734
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:38,868
OMG.
What, darling?

735
00:33:39,182 --> 00:33:40,318

On. on!

739
00:33:45,742 --> 00:33:47,665
Oh, no.

740
00:33:47,742 --> 00:33:49,585
Oh, no, this is horrible.

741
00:33:50,142 --> 00:33:51,871
Disgusting.

742
00:33:52,102 --> 00:33:54,103
Oh, they hate you!

743
00:33:54,221 --> 00:33:55,791
Who? Who?

744
00:33:55,941 --> 00:33:57,227
Oh, there she is.

745
00:33:57,581 --> 00:33:59,151
Here she is.

746
00:33:59,741 --> 00:34:01,266
The fat woman!

747
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:03,585
Yeah, just do the toes.

748
00:34:05,021 --> 00:34:06,785
Your fat little toes?

749
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:09,910
The fat little celebrity toes?

750
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,620
Yeah, yeah.
Right.

751
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,271
Fat woman kills thin woman.

752
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,702
You don't know anything!
It was an accident!

753
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,904
Nothing about you
is an accident.

754
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,789
May <i>I</i> Suggest...

755
00:34:26,019 --> 00:34:27,020
Fat Pink?

756
00:34:29,019 --> 00:34:30,020
What are you doing?

757
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,180
Oh, here we go.

758
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:34,301
This is my therapy, sweetheart.

759
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:37,907
When are you going to
just for one moment...

760
00:34:38,218 --> 00:34:41,188
take in the enormity
of what has happened?

761
00:34:41,818 --> 00:34:44,298
When are you going to
stop rolling through life,

762
00:34:44,378 --> 00:34:46,619
wanting more and more?

763
00:34:46,938 --> 00:34:49,942
Look at this house. Nobody
needs a house this big.

764
00:34:50,138 --> 00:34:51,299
I do.

765
00:34:51,818 --> 00:34:54,946
You see?
Even your house is fat.

766
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,178
I'm on a diet.

767
00:34:56,377 --> 00:34:59,108
You're always on a diet, Mum,
but you're always fat.

768
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:00,178
Mmm-hmm.

769
00:35:00,257 --> 00:35:01,907
Because you never stop eating!

770
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:02,978
Mmm-hmm.

771
00:35:03,817 --> 00:35:05,148
Now will you please...

772
00:35:05,657 --> 00:35:09,342
just stop for one second
and look at what you've done?

773
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,102
Yes.

774
00:35:15,456 --> 00:35:18,460
Oh, I love that girl.

775
00:35:23,335 --> 00:35:25,861
Your death threats, m'lady.

776
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:31,859
<i>Like a bird on the wire</i>

777
00:35:33,615 --> 00:35:38,017
<i>Like a drunk in a midnight choir</i>

778
00:35:38,854 --> 00:35:40,856
Everybody bloody hates you!

779
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,778
Stupid bloody drunk!

780
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,863
You mucky bitch.

781
00:35:45,454 --> 00:35:47,343
You filthy scunner!

782
00:35:48,454 --> 00:35:50,456
You make me sick.

783
00:35:50,814 --> 00:35:54,784
<i>Like a worm on a hook</i>

784
00:35:55,773 --> 00:35:57,537
I'm innocent.

785
00:35:57,693 --> 00:36:00,458
Patsy Stone.
But I am innocent.

786
00:36:00,693 --> 00:36:03,094
Excuse me, guys.
I'm the victim here.

787
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:05,023
I'm Patsy Stone,
but I am innocent.

788
00:36:06,053 --> 00:36:08,012
That's it, Patsy, lovely.
Thank you, darling.

789
00:36:10,892 --> 00:36:11,893
Thanks.

790
00:36:12,452 --> 00:36:13,453
Thursday.

791
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:30,581
Can you please shut up, darling?

792
00:36:30,651 --> 00:36:32,016
I'm trying to do
my Mindlessness.

793
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:36,095
I'm being trollied on Twitter.

794
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,851
Oh.

795
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,058
Everybody hates me.

796
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,699
When I was coming in earlier,
a woman screamed at me.

797
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,495
What did she say?

798
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,852
She told me I was a pariah.

799
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,930
Do you know what a pariah is?

800
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:55,413
It's a fish.

801
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:58,935
That's right.

802
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:02,136
Flash, flash, flash.
Flash for Patsy.

803
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:04,531
Patsy, flash, flash, flash.

804
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:05,929
Ugh, Eddy.

805
00:37:08,088 --> 00:37:09,533
You killed Kate Moss!

806
00:37:09,608 --> 00:37:11,736
I've lost my job because of you!

807
00:37:12,048 --> 00:37:14,528
And now lam nothing as well.

808
00:37:26,767 --> 00:37:29,054
It's from Stella McCartney.

809
00:37:46,526 --> 00:37:48,449
How many "Om's"
have I given you?

810
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:50,527
How much money?

811
00:37:50,725 --> 00:37:52,489
Where is my enlightenment?

812
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,135
Where is my nirvana,

813
00:37:54,445 --> 00:37:57,528
you stupid, blue,
buggering Buddha!

814
00:38:05,844 --> 00:38:07,653
Om...

815
00:38:09,844 --> 00:38:11,573
Om...

816
00:38:12,044 --> 00:38:14,445
Ba-ding-ding-ding-ding,
cha...

817
00:38:14,924 --> 00:38:17,086
Om...

818
00:38:18,084 --> 00:38:21,451
Ba-ring-ding-ding-
ding-ding-cha...

819
00:38:22,163 --> 00:38:23,972
Om...

820
00:38:27,563 --> 00:38:29,565
on.

821
00:38:38,122 --> 00:38:40,124
Sorry you lost your job,
darling.

822
00:38:40,962 --> 00:38:42,123
You're not nothing.

823
00:38:43,442 --> 00:38:44,773
Cheers, thanks a lot.

824
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:52,002
It's the first thing
I've ever had from Stella.

825
00:38:52,441 --> 00:38:53,522
Oh, Eddy.

826
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:56,605
So the little scrap drowned.
People will forget that.

827
00:38:56,721 --> 00:38:58,564
They've forgotten a lot worse.

828
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:01,042
I mean, look at lovely Hugh.

829
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:03,886
He unzipped his chinos for
a prossie blowjob

830
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,041
and we forgave him.

831
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,123
In fact, I think we loved him
a little bit more after that.

832
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,209
She's probably popped up
somewhere, hasn't she?

833
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,482
Confused and shivering.

834
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,241
Poor little tiny wet Katie,
flapping about in the mud.

835
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:22,886
Washed up on the Isle of Dogs.

836
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:27,165
I mean, Eddy...

837
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,888
things float.

838
00:39:29,959 --> 00:39:30,960
Yeah.

839
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:34,765
Yeah, things drift,
and they float.

840
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:37,768
Why don't those idiots float
something down the river?

841
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:39,839
Eddy.

842
00:39:40,638 --> 00:39:43,164
If you want something done,
you've got to do it yourself.

843
00:39:43,918 --> 00:39:45,079
Yeah.

844
00:39:51,757 --> 00:39:54,078
It's the right place
and the right time.

845
00:39:54,637 --> 00:39:56,639
What for?
Shut up.

846
00:40:02,197 --> 00:40:03,197
Are you ready, Pats?

847
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:05,716
Ready, Eddy.
Ready for what?

848
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:07,157
Ah.

849
00:40:09,996 --> 00:40:11,760
Go, drift.

850
00:40:18,635 --> 00:40:19,966
Bubble?

851
00:40:20,275 --> 00:40:21,276
Bubble!

852
00:40:21,955 --> 00:40:24,117
Where is she, Ed?
I don't know. Bubble?

853
00:40:24,275 --> 00:40:25,765
She swims too fast.

854
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:28,082
There she is. Go forward!
What is she doing?

855
00:40:28,275 --> 00:40:29,276
Bubble!

856
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:30,771
Fish her out, the little insect.

857
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:31,876
Bubble!

858
00:40:36,674 --> 00:40:37,960
Bubble?

859
00:40:38,114 --> 00:40:40,082
Darling, she fell off.

860
00:40:41,074 --> 00:40:42,235
Eddy.

861
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:44,005
It's okay, no one saw.

862
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:45,804
But, Eddy, they'll find her!

863
00:40:45,874 --> 00:40:48,114
Then just go, go, go!

864
00:40:50,553 --> 00:40:52,794
Go, darling, go, go, go-

865
00:41:00,553 --> 00:41:02,077
Oh, that's great, isn't it?

866
00:41:02,152 --> 00:41:03,802
Now I've killed two people!

867
00:41:03,872 --> 00:41:04,873
Oh!

868
00:41:04,992 --> 00:41:05,993
Come on!

869
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:08,720
Eddy, we've got to get away.
We've got to go now.

870
00:41:08,992 --> 00:41:10,756
But where?
I can't leave the country.

871
00:41:10,832 --> 00:41:12,834
I'm a marked woman.

872
00:41:13,232 --> 00:41:14,996
We could go north.
North?

873
00:41:15,232 --> 00:41:16,721
What, south?

874
00:41:16,831 --> 00:41:18,515
You know what we need.

875
00:41:18,631 --> 00:41:20,281
We need money.

876
00:41:23,991 --> 00:41:26,278
Darling, darling.
Listen.

877
00:41:27,271 --> 00:41:29,638
When this is actually over,

878
00:41:29,711 --> 00:41:32,281
and it will actually be
over one day, darling...

879
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:36,034
will you please
just remind me...

880
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:40,033
to go back for the boots I
just saw in Westwood window.

881
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,275
Eddy?

882
00:41:47,029 --> 00:41:48,315
What is this?

883
00:41:48,389 --> 00:41:50,278
Darling, it's a onesie.

884
00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:51,680
Mmm-hmm.

885
00:41:52,629 --> 00:41:54,154
I've got some pills.

886
00:41:54,629 --> 00:41:55,960
Pills, pills, pills.

887
00:41:56,269 --> 00:41:58,749
I've got some little blue
ones, little pink ones.

888
00:41:59,029 --> 00:42:01,076
That little blue one.
What's that?

889
00:42:01,748 --> 00:42:02,749
It's a button.

890
00:42:07,828 --> 00:42:10,718
Maybe I should just resign
myself to my fate, darling.

891
00:42:12,068 --> 00:42:14,992
<i>I mean, I can't redecorate my
way out of this one, can I?</i>

892
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:17,069
You bitch!

893
00:42:18,187 --> 00:42:19,951
Eddy, we've got to escape.

894
00:42:20,027 --> 00:42:21,791
We've got to get out
of the country.

895
00:42:21,987 --> 00:42:23,318
I have no money.

896
00:42:23,387 --> 00:42:25,867
Why didn't you marry some of
those rich men you slept with?

897
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:27,068
That wasn't the point.

898
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:28,953
There must be someone.

899
00:42:29,027 --> 00:42:30,915
There must be someone, darling.

900
00:42:31,186 --> 00:42:34,747
Think. We've got to make
a serious plan. Think!

901
00:42:38,906 --> 00:42:40,317
We could try a bong.

902
00:42:40,426 --> 00:42:41,791
I've got a bong.

903
00:42:49,105 --> 00:42:52,234
Everyone used to die young in
old cavemen historical times.

904
00:42:52,305 --> 00:42:54,114
They didn't reach the age of 30.

905
00:42:54,265 --> 00:42:57,269
<i>That's why now, everyone young
just wants to go so fast.</i>

906
00:42:57,665 --> 00:42:59,827
<i>But at our age,
you're lost, because...</i>

907
00:43:00,904 --> 00:43:02,144
we should all be dead.

908
00:43:02,344 --> 00:43:04,950
Shouldn't we, darling?
No, Eddy, no.

909
00:43:05,424 --> 00:43:06,914
It's very good to die young.

910
00:43:07,104 --> 00:43:09,345
It is good to go young.

911
00:43:09,984 --> 00:43:10,985
Yeah.

912
00:43:14,824 --> 00:43:16,712
Oh, no, it's ash.

913
00:43:20,103 --> 00:43:21,946
On.

914
00:43:22,023 --> 00:43:23,184
Oh...

915
00:43:23,303 --> 00:43:24,384
Eddy, there was Charlie.

916
00:43:24,783 --> 00:43:25,864
Who's Charlie?

917
00:43:25,943 --> 00:43:28,708
Charlie Douglas.
He had an enormous yacht.

918
00:43:32,822 --> 00:43:34,153
Ah, he never married.

919
00:43:34,302 --> 00:43:36,464
He said I was the only girl
he would ever marry.

920
00:43:36,742 --> 00:43:38,392
He said he would wait for me.

921
00:43:38,822 --> 00:43:40,312
Oh...
We had some good times.

922
00:43:40,382 --> 00:43:42,384
We had good times
and he was rich!

923
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:44,662
He was very rich!

924
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:49,751
Eddy?
Yeah.

925
00:43:49,981 --> 00:43:52,382
Saffy's little birth blob
has money.

926
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:58,422
Darling. We need Lola.
We need to take Lola.

927
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,060
Yeah, we need Lola.

928
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,991
I can hear everything
you're saying, you know.

929
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,260
Everything.

930
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,911
Are you looking for my money
so you can go find Charlie?

931
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,426
No, no, no, darling.
No, no.

932
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,749
Yes! Give us your credit cards
and you won't get hurt!

933
00:44:14,939 --> 00:44:15,940
Why should I?

934
00:44:16,179 --> 00:44:17,226
Oh. Oh...

935
00:44:17,299 --> 00:44:20,746
Because, darling, now you
listen to me, all right?

936
00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:22,748
I've messed up, I know that,

937
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:24,907
but that will happen
to anybody...

938
00:44:25,179 --> 00:44:26,305
who really lives life,

939
00:44:26,379 --> 00:44:29,188
who really lives life, darling.

940
00:44:29,418 --> 00:44:31,785
And I now know
who my friends are.

941
00:44:31,898 --> 00:44:34,868
Husbands, they come and go,
but my friend has stayed.

942
00:44:36,018 --> 00:44:37,019
Why does she stay?

943
00:44:38,018 --> 00:44:39,463
Because it's bloody good fun.

944
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,304
We have fun.

945
00:44:41,778 --> 00:44:44,348
Good fun, darling.
And you know what?

946
00:44:44,777 --> 00:44:48,463
There's so many great times
out there waiting for us.

947
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:50,899
And I don't want to miss them.

948
00:44:51,097 --> 00:44:52,462
We don't want to
miss them, do we?

949
00:44:52,537 --> 00:44:54,380
Or would you rather stay here?

950
00:44:54,777 --> 00:44:57,781
You know, with Mum.
Dull old Mum.

951
00:44:58,776 --> 00:45:00,778
Or come with us, sweetheart.

952
00:45:01,336 --> 00:45:04,067
Come with us. For fun.

953
00:45:06,216 --> 00:45:07,866
Fine.

954
00:45:08,136 --> 00:45:09,422
You'll need more than the card.

955
00:45:09,496 --> 00:45:12,261
We can't just walk out of
the house in broad daylight.

956
00:45:12,456 --> 00:45:16,062
Yeah, of course.
We need help. More help.

957
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,144
Who else would be stupid
enough to help you two?

958
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,216
Huh.

959
00:45:20,015 --> 00:45:22,017
On.

960
00:45:24,575 --> 00:45:26,896
So what is Patsy's plan?

961
00:45:27,135 --> 00:45:28,295
Just do what I do.

962
00:45:28,494 --> 00:45:31,498
We sneak into the house
looking perfectly normal.

963
00:45:31,814 --> 00:45:34,181
It'll be a nightmare
with all the paparazzi.

964
00:45:34,934 --> 00:45:37,744
Excuse me! No!
No photographs!

965
00:45:38,254 --> 00:45:40,256
No one's taking any photos.

966
00:45:40,334 --> 00:45:42,302
It's as if they
didn't know who we are.

967
00:45:42,374 --> 00:45:44,375
Missed a
perfect opportunity. Get in.

968
00:45:44,853 --> 00:45:46,264
No photos, no photos.

969
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:47,983
Come on, dear.

970
00:45:48,853 --> 00:45:50,776
Police are urging
the crowd to move on.

971
00:45:50,973 --> 00:45:53,260
<i>The flowers, offerings
of Hunter Wellingtons...</i>

972
00:45:53,413 --> 00:45:55,620
and bottles of Sauvignon Blanc

973
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,298
are proving
a hazard to shipping.

974
00:45:57,493 --> 00:45:59,859
Oh, for God's sake, turn it off.

975
00:46:00,972 --> 00:46:05,261
We can't, darling. We're drunk
and have eaten too many drugs.

976
00:46:05,532 --> 00:46:07,182
As per usual.

977
00:46:10,972 --> 00:46:12,098
Where's Mum?

978
00:46:15,971 --> 00:46:17,302
What has happened to Kate Moss?

979
00:46:17,371 --> 00:46:20,534
Where is she? What in
the world is going on?

980
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,892
Quick, quick.
Almost there.

981
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:34,141
Get into this taxi
where we're going nowhere.

982
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:35,331
What took you so long?

983
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:36,656
Hurry up, Fleur.

984
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:37,891
It's these bloody shoes.

985
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:39,455
All right, taxi, drive.

986
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:41,130
Drive, drive!

987
00:46:43,289 --> 00:46:44,370
Welcome back.

988
00:46:44,489 --> 00:46:47,572
So, Lily, can you tell us how
you're feeling about Kate?

989
00:46:48,009 --> 00:46:49,534
Well...
Put it into words.

990
00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:52,013
Well, I...
Sad.

991
00:46:52,329 --> 00:46:54,093
I didn't actually
know her that well.

992
00:46:54,209 --> 00:46:56,018
You're devastated.

993
00:46:56,329 --> 00:46:57,329
L...

994
00:46:57,408 --> 00:46:59,888
Heartbroken.
Thank you so much.

995
00:47:00,168 --> 00:47:03,172
Your feelings are shared
by a nation still in shock.

996
00:47:08,008 --> 00:47:09,931
How's your mother holding up?

997
00:47:11,048 --> 00:47:13,573
It seems to be taking its toll...
facially.

998
00:47:15,047 --> 00:47:16,572
I'm going to wake Lola up.

999
00:47:16,687 --> 00:47:18,337
I can't believe
she slept this long.

1000
00:47:18,447 --> 00:47:20,370
Let her sleep.
She's a grownup.

1001
00:47:20,607 --> 00:47:22,450
She's thirteen.

1002
00:47:33,486 --> 00:47:36,057
I want you to know something.

1003
00:47:38,206 --> 00:47:40,493
I'm sorry I went out that night.

1004
00:47:43,365 --> 00:47:44,491
I, uh...

1005
00:47:46,485 --> 00:47:48,487
should have stayed with you.

1006
00:47:49,485 --> 00:47:53,968
Then perhaps you wouldn't have
got caught up in all this mess.

1007
00:48:03,364 --> 00:48:04,968
I love you.

1008
00:48:11,963 --> 00:48:15,410
Lola's gone. She's gone! She
must have gone with them!

1009
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:18,653
Tell me where they've gone.

1010
00:48:19,403 --> 00:48:20,928
Tell me!

1011
00:48:21,043 --> 00:48:22,647
Whoa, whoa. Calm down.

1012
00:48:23,123 --> 00:48:24,249
Where have they gone?

1013
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,443
We don't know.

1014
00:48:25,562 --> 00:48:26,563
We weren't told.

1015
00:48:27,002 --> 00:48:29,653
A girl has only one confidante
and mum's the word.

1016
00:48:29,722 --> 00:48:33,124
Oh, her hairdresser,
Christopher. Oh!

1017
00:48:33,402 --> 00:48:34,642
Judas.

1018
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:36,288
I knew she spoke to him

1019
00:48:36,362 --> 00:48:38,330
because she canceled
her next appointment.

1020
00:48:38,522 --> 00:48:39,683
Don't panic.

1021
00:48:39,762 --> 00:48:42,526
It's only a problem
if they've left the country.

1022
00:48:46,441 --> 00:48:47,772
<i>Welcome to Budget.</i>

1023
00:48:48,121 --> 00:48:51,125
Where the only tossers
are our baggage handlers.

1024
00:48:51,441 --> 00:48:52,681
How are you? Hi.

1025
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:54,367
Morning.
Oh, shut up.

1026
00:48:54,521 --> 00:48:55,760
Where we wing it.

1027
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,770
<i>Welcome on-board
Budget Airlines.</i>

1028
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,168
<i>This is flight BD115 to Nice.</i>

1029
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,761
Where is first class?
Down the back?

1030
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,770
On...

1031
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,685
There is no first class.

1032
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,445
It's just first ass
on any available seat.

1033
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,046
We are three.
There's only two seats.

1034
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:15,243
The middle one isn't a seat,
it's where you put your bag.

1035
00:49:15,439 --> 00:49:18,727
Oh, no, they're all seats.
Uh, you put your bags up top.

1036
00:49:20,279 --> 00:49:21,280
Oh, God.

1037
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:22,720
Uh...

1038
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:26,719
I don't put the bags up.
I'm the designated DNB.

1039
00:49:28,638 --> 00:49:29,799
"Do Nothing Bitch."

1040
00:49:33,398 --> 00:49:34,638
- Thank you.
- Ow!

1041
00:49:35,878 --> 00:49:37,482
Sandwich. Heads up.

1042
00:49:37,718 --> 00:49:39,557
Can we get free nuts
and drinks from the bitch?

1043
00:49:39,637 --> 00:49:42,641
Oi, waitress? We want our
complimentary drinks and nuts.

1044
00:49:43,037 --> 00:49:47,486
Oh, you have to prepay for all
the snacks and beverages.

1045
00:49:47,717 --> 00:49:51,085
Just get your credit card,
slip it through your slot.

1046
00:49:51,317 --> 00:49:53,638
Uh, ma'am, you'll have
to take your seat.

1047
00:49:54,076 --> 00:49:55,316
I need a piss.

1048
00:49:55,516 --> 00:49:56,642
It'll have to wait.

1049
00:49:58,636 --> 00:50:00,161
I've started.

1050
00:50:05,196 --> 00:50:08,086
I hate how you have to be nice
to transgendered people now.

1051
00:50:08,276 --> 00:50:10,164
Just reach around and get
that lady's red wine.

1052
00:50:10,235 --> 00:50:11,396
No.

1053
00:50:18,155 --> 00:50:20,362
Oi! Drop the fag, hag!

1054
00:50:20,675 --> 00:50:22,120
What is your problem?

1055
00:50:22,635 --> 00:50:23,795
You!

1056
00:50:34,474 --> 00:50:38,683
Cheers. Don't get
that on British Airways.

1057
00:50:51,873 --> 00:50:52,874
Whoo-hoo!

1058
00:50:53,672 --> 00:50:54,673
<i>We did it, Pats!</i>

1059
00:50:54,832 --> 00:50:56,800
Oh, Eddy, We did it!

1060
00:50:56,872 --> 00:50:58,237
We're free, free!

1061
00:50:58,552 --> 00:50:59,917
We can breathe!

1062
00:50:59,992 --> 00:51:01,118
Breathe!

1063
00:51:01,712 --> 00:51:03,601
We're going to join the jet set.

1064
00:51:03,792 --> 00:51:04,793
The jet set.

1065
00:51:05,232 --> 00:51:07,234
So you're going to marry
this Charlie?

1066
00:51:07,392 --> 00:51:09,234
She's going to marry him,

1067
00:51:09,311 --> 00:51:11,311
then he's going to die
and we'll get all the money.

1068
00:51:12,231 --> 00:51:13,471
How old is he?

1069
00:51:13,551 --> 00:51:14,791
Oh, he's ancient.

1070
00:51:15,231 --> 00:51:16,915
He's old.
He's like on death's door.

1071
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:19,520
Actually,
he's the same age as me.

1072
00:51:22,391 --> 00:51:24,392
We need more champagne, darling.

1073
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:25,806
No, it's nearly over its limit.

1074
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:26,831
What does that mean?

1075
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:29,756
It means we need Charlie's
big bucks, darling,

1076
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:31,753
if we're ever going to
live the dream.

1077
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:34,721
Oh, Eddy, the dream.
The dream, darling.

1078
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:39,756
<i>But where do you go to my lovely</i>

1079
00:51:40,149 --> 00:51:42,755
<i>When you're alone in your bed</i>

1080
00:51:44,429 --> 00:51:47,433
<i>Tell me the thoughts
that surround you</i>

1081
00:51:48,269 --> 00:51:50,636
<i>I want to look inside
your head, yes, I do</i>

1082
00:52:00,748 --> 00:52:03,513
I need to buy champagne.
What's that in French?

1083
00:52:03,588 --> 00:52:05,397
<i>Champignons, champignons.</i>

1084
00:52:05,508 --> 00:52:07,271
We need to get out
of these clothes.

1085
00:52:07,427 --> 00:52:09,236
It's all right, darling.
No one knows us here.

1086
00:52:09,307 --> 00:52:10,672
They're just so horrible.

1087
00:52:11,627 --> 00:52:12,753
On, Eddy?

1088
00:52:13,787 --> 00:52:15,471
Oh.

1089
00:52:16,547 --> 00:52:17,878
<i>Buongiorno!</i>

1090
00:52:22,426 --> 00:52:24,667
Baby Bunton, Pats.
Baby Bunton.

1091
00:52:24,746 --> 00:52:25,747
Shit.

1092
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,751
Eddy, Eddy.

1093
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:41,636
Why can't we go anywhere
without knowing someone?

1094
00:52:41,905 --> 00:52:43,475
She didn't see us.

1095
00:52:44,345 --> 00:52:46,234
I think I just saw
Edina Monsoon.

1096
00:52:46,305 --> 00:52:47,352
Really?

1097
00:52:47,545 --> 00:52:50,549
Unless you've seen
a mannequin that fat before.

1098
00:53:00,664 --> 00:53:03,235
Hiya. You okay?

1099
00:53:04,904 --> 00:53:07,793
I've put you into
hot yoga after this.

1100
00:53:07,863 --> 00:53:09,911
You do it
in an actual oven. Ooh!

1101
00:53:10,983 --> 00:53:12,712
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

1102
00:53:12,783 --> 00:53:15,514
Just don't think
about Edina Monsoon.

1103
00:53:16,263 --> 00:53:17,628
Oh, thanks.

1104
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:21,673
It's Emma Bunton.

1105
00:53:21,942 --> 00:53:23,671
What? Emma Bunton?

1106
00:53:25,822 --> 00:53:27,665
No. Edina?

1107
00:53:27,942 --> 00:53:29,387
She's where?

1108
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:30,743
Did you call the police?

1109
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:33,229
Yes. And I'm going
over there to make sure

1110
00:53:33,302 --> 00:53:34,713
the police do their job!

1111
00:53:34,862 --> 00:53:36,863
Her P.A. has a house
near Cannes.

1112
00:53:37,261 --> 00:53:39,548
Bubble has a house there?
Yeah.

1113
00:53:39,741 --> 00:53:41,027
You talked to her?

1114
00:53:41,421 --> 00:53:43,742
Yeah. She's had
a terrible time.

1115
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:45,949
It's been quite a saga.

1116
00:53:46,821 --> 00:53:48,550
Nothing.

1117
00:53:50,021 --> 00:53:51,545
What's that?

1118
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,707
That's nice. eBay?

1119
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,861
Oi!

1120
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,548
Oi, you!

1121
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:04,386
<i>Bonjour.
Bonjour.</i>

1122
00:54:05,419 --> 00:54:07,387
Have you been in the water long?

1123
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:09,985
All bloody night.
Did you jump?

1124
00:54:10,419 --> 00:54:13,741
Did I, buggery.
I was pushed.

1125
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:18,987
Lola won't answer my calls and I've
tried every number for Christopher.

1126
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:21,026
I'll have to look for him.

1127
00:54:21,178 --> 00:54:22,464
At least she's with your mother.

1128
00:54:23,138 --> 00:54:24,139
And Patsy.

1129
00:54:25,218 --> 00:54:26,504
My daughter is with Patsy.

1130
00:54:26,698 --> 00:54:27,779
I'll come with you.

1131
00:54:28,058 --> 00:54:29,594
Edina must be back in 3 days
for the primary hearing.

1132
00:54:29,618 --> 00:54:32,428
I don't care about her.
No, I'm sorry.

1133
00:54:32,618 --> 00:54:34,382
Let me.
No!

1134
00:54:35,057 --> 00:54:36,627
I'm better on my own.

1135
00:54:49,257 --> 00:54:52,624
<i>Shoot that poison arrow
to my heart, heart, heart</i>

1136
00:54:53,136 --> 00:54:54,740
<i>Shoot that poison arrow
to my heart</i>

1137
00:54:55,176 --> 00:54:56,621
Oh, hello. I know you.

1138
00:54:56,776 --> 00:54:59,427
My mother used to bring me
here as a child.

1139
00:55:00,536 --> 00:55:03,824
<i>Shoot that poison arrow
to my heart, heart, heart</i>

1140
00:55:04,455 --> 00:55:06,105
<i>Shoot that poison arrow</i>

1141
00:55:08,255 --> 00:55:10,303
<i>Shoot that poison arrow</i>

1142
00:55:13,215 --> 00:55:16,344
<i>Christopher, I know you're
here. I just saw you.</i>

1143
00:55:19,095 --> 00:55:21,142
<i>My daughter's gone missing</i>

1144
00:55:21,214 --> 00:55:22,739
<i>and I think you know
where she's gone.</i>

1145
00:55:23,134 --> 00:55:24,624
Clear off, you little wet wipe!

1146
00:55:27,454 --> 00:55:29,218
Just sing something.

1147
00:55:29,294 --> 00:55:31,456
That'll quieten them down.

1148
00:55:32,214 --> 00:55:34,454
Get off, you little bitch troll!

1149
00:55:39,213 --> 00:55:41,454
<i>I</i> learned the <i>truth at</i> seventeen

1150
00:55:41,733 --> 00:55:45,180
<i>That love was meant
for beauty queens</i>

1151
00:55:46,133 --> 00:55:49,420
<i>And high school girls
with clear-skinned smiles</i>

1152
00:55:49,732 --> 00:55:53,259
<i>Who married young
and then retired</i>

1153
00:55:56,692 --> 00:56:00,617
<i>And those of us
with ravaged faces</i>

1154
00:56:01,452 --> 00:56:04,341
<i>Lacking in the social graces</i>

1155
00:56:04,691 --> 00:56:08,138
<i>Desperately remained at home</i>

1156
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:11,494
<i>In venting lovers on the phone</i>

1157
00:56:12,171 --> 00:56:15,493
<i>Who called to say
"Come dance with me"</i>

1158
00:56:16,771 --> 00:56:19,853
<i>And murmured vague obscenities</i>

1159
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:25,332
<i>It isn't all it seems
at seventeen</i>

1160
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:31,494
<i>So who is this Charles?</i>

1161
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:33,817
Oh, just an old scrotum
Patsy knows.

1162
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:35,300
More money than marbles.

1163
00:56:35,529 --> 00:56:37,418
Charles was rather superb,
actually.

1164
00:56:37,609 --> 00:56:40,613
Back when the South of France
was really something...

1165
00:56:40,809 --> 00:56:42,140
God created woman

1166
00:56:42,209 --> 00:56:44,291
and Brigitte Bardot
was just out of nappies.

1167
00:56:44,489 --> 00:56:46,491
She's back in 'em now.

1168
00:56:46,689 --> 00:56:48,690
What did Charles do?
Films.

1169
00:56:48,888 --> 00:56:51,368
What kind?
Art films.

1170
00:56:54,768 --> 00:56:55,929
Oh, porn!

1171
00:56:58,288 --> 00:56:59,858
Well, no.
For connoisseurs...

1172
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,289
Gentlemen.

1173
00:57:01,408 --> 00:57:02,489
Gentlesseurs.

1174
00:57:02,727 --> 00:57:03,727
If you don't find him?

1175
00:57:03,767 --> 00:57:05,292
This is my old hunting ground.

1176
00:57:05,527 --> 00:57:07,529
Plenty of prey out there.

1177
00:57:07,727 --> 00:57:09,650
And they won't need
beaters to flush 'em out

1178
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:11,809
once they sniff me up
the Croisette.

1179
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:16,532
So the plan is, we start
at Violet's party, right?

1180
00:57:16,727 --> 00:57:18,455
The old guys will be there.

1181
00:57:18,646 --> 00:57:19,822
My mother doesn't know anything

1182
00:57:19,846 --> 00:57:21,257
and Violet won't care.

1183
00:57:21,366 --> 00:57:23,255
In the South of France,
everyone's a criminal!

1184
00:57:24,446 --> 00:57:25,572
Plenty of cleavage, Eddy.

1185
00:57:25,766 --> 00:57:26,862
Yes, darling.
I'm wearing this.

1186
00:57:26,886 --> 00:57:28,251
But not those shoes.

1187
00:57:28,446 --> 00:57:30,255
Those shoes, darling.
Not those shoes.

1188
00:57:30,526 --> 00:57:31,573
But I like these shoes.

1189
00:57:31,726 --> 00:57:32,772
They make you hobble.

1190
00:57:33,205 --> 00:57:36,766
I'm wearing them anyway.
I have thin ankles.

1191
00:57:37,765 --> 00:57:41,451
<i>We all play the game
and when we dare</i>

1192
00:57:41,845 --> 00:57:45,372
<i>We cheat ourselves at solitaire</i>

1193
00:57:45,725 --> 00:57:48,648
<i>In venting lovers on the phone</i>

1194
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:50,204
Oh, my God.

1195
00:57:50,244 --> 00:57:52,372
What that woman has done to you.

1196
00:57:53,484 --> 00:57:54,540
You have to tell me
where she is.

1197
00:57:54,564 --> 00:57:55,565
Do you know?

1198
00:57:56,364 --> 00:57:58,492
Cannes. Cannes in France.
Thank you.

1199
00:57:58,804 --> 00:57:59,805
And, hey.

1200
00:58:00,604 --> 00:58:01,724
Make your own kind of music.

1201
00:58:09,723 --> 00:58:10,724
<i>Merci.</i>

1202
00:58:10,803 --> 00:58:12,487
You're very lucky at this.

1203
00:58:12,683 --> 00:58:13,923
No, not luck.

1204
00:58:14,003 --> 00:58:16,449
It's just that
I play a bad hand well.

1205
00:58:16,603 --> 00:58:18,252
Don't we all?

1206
00:58:18,482 --> 00:58:19,893
Keep behind us.

1207
00:58:19,962 --> 00:58:21,452
Stay behind.
Don't come with us.

1208
00:58:21,602 --> 00:58:22,888
This is it, Eddy.

1209
00:58:24,522 --> 00:58:26,604
I'm looking good, I'm looking...

1210
00:58:28,962 --> 00:58:31,646
Oh, Eddy, look how young we are.

1211
00:58:32,401 --> 00:58:33,926
Look at the sad shoes.

1212
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:35,737
It's all leopard print
and liver spots.

1213
00:58:35,761 --> 00:58:37,331
It's like old age camouflage.

1214
00:58:37,521 --> 00:58:39,410
I smell formaldehyde.

1215
00:58:39,601 --> 00:58:41,603
What on earth
are you doing here?

1216
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:42,927
Mrs. M.

1217
00:58:43,321 --> 00:58:44,732
Just looking for the party.

1218
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:45,922
Well, this is it.

1219
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,365
Yoo-hoo!

1220
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,926
Christ, is that Violet?

1221
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,607
What is this,
some late-life lesbo party?

1222
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,841
Where are the men?

1223
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,645
They're on the terrace, dear.

1224
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:59,407
We have to make do with
cards and a little dancing.

1225
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,969
It's quite nice, actually.

1226
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:05,760
Terrace, terrace, terrace.

1227
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:06,886
Yeah. Yeah.

1228
00:59:06,959 --> 00:59:10,680
You stay here with the old ones.
We're off.

1229
00:59:11,279 --> 00:59:13,850
Ooh, look, Pats, not
hobbling, not hobbling.

1230
00:59:21,518 --> 00:59:23,441
Ah, this is more like it, Eds.

1231
00:59:23,638 --> 00:59:25,606
This is our kind of party,
darling.

1232
00:59:25,678 --> 00:59:27,646
We fit in here.

1233
00:59:28,358 --> 00:59:29,644
Hey, Monty.
How's things?

1234
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:31,999
No ex-wives
allowed here.

1235
00:59:32,437 --> 00:59:34,439
You need some help, old ladies?

1236
00:59:36,317 --> 00:59:38,445
The place is full of
weird babies.

1237
00:59:38,637 --> 00:59:40,526
Little stretched fetus faces.

1238
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:41,917
Patsy!

1239
00:59:42,317 --> 00:59:43,318
Patsy!

1240
00:59:43,877 --> 00:59:46,004
It's Charlie. Stay here.
Jesus.

1241
00:59:46,796 --> 00:59:49,447
My God! I'd know
those tits anywhere!

1242
00:59:49,716 --> 00:59:51,002
Patsy!

1243
00:59:52,476 --> 00:59:54,604
Oh, Charles, darling.

1244
00:59:55,876 --> 00:59:57,719
What are you doing here,
Patricia?

1245
00:59:57,916 --> 00:59:59,918
Charles, darling,
looking for you.

1246
01:00:00,076 --> 01:00:01,520
On.

1247
01:00:02,355 --> 01:00:03,686
Still got the yacht, Charlie?

1248
01:00:04,355 --> 01:00:05,595
I've got a big one.

1249
01:00:05,995 --> 01:00:07,360
The trouble is the girls

1250
01:00:07,435 --> 01:00:09,676
all want their own cabins
these days.

1251
01:00:10,395 --> 01:00:13,365
Oh, Charlie, do you
remember the old days?

1252
01:00:13,875 --> 01:00:17,924
You... Fiona
and that Kristel wench.

1253
01:00:18,074 --> 01:00:20,395
No, Charlie. I meant us.

1254
01:00:21,474 --> 01:00:23,920
Black Emanuelle meets Hitler.

1255
01:00:24,474 --> 01:00:26,602
I loved that film!

1256
01:00:28,034 --> 01:00:29,797
Do you remember
waking up together

1257
01:00:29,873 --> 01:00:32,035
in hot, sweet Saint-Tropez?

1258
01:00:32,393 --> 01:00:36,034
Walking across the duckboards
down to the fairy blue sea?

1259
01:00:36,433 --> 01:00:38,276
Oh, I miss those times.

1260
01:00:39,033 --> 01:00:40,603
So do I, Charlie.

1261
01:00:40,753 --> 01:00:42,755
But you know what I really miss?

1262
01:00:42,953 --> 01:00:44,442
Yes, Charles.

1263
01:00:45,512 --> 01:00:46,673
Pubic hair.

1264
01:00:46,752 --> 01:00:47,992
I'm sick of those Brazilians...

1265
01:00:48,392 --> 01:00:51,919
those Hollywoods.
So bald, so boring.

1266
01:00:52,432 --> 01:00:54,594
I had a full beard
in those days.

1267
01:00:54,752 --> 01:00:57,756
But I suppose
you are what you eat.

1268
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,597
But Charlie, Charlie,
look at me.

1269
01:01:01,751 --> 01:01:05,642
Remember you said you
would only ever marry me?

1270
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:07,111
Uh, I might have said that.

1271
01:01:07,511 --> 01:01:09,673
Well, Charles, I'm ready.

1272
01:01:10,431 --> 01:01:12,115
My answer is yes.

1273
01:01:12,791 --> 01:01:14,997
Steady on, Patsy, steady on.

1274
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:18,801
As you can see, we're very
well catered for here.

1275
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:23,674
Charlie, you always said
I was the one.

1276
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:26,791
I think he's tired of you now.

1277
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:29,959
Isn't she terrific looking?

1278
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:31,959
Charlie, she's a gold digger.

1279
01:01:32,429 --> 01:01:33,954
I'm a gold mine.

1280
01:01:36,669 --> 01:01:40,469
Oh, by the way,
steer clear of the Jacuzzi.

1281
01:01:40,669 --> 01:01:43,831
It's a smoothie of old sperm.

1282
01:01:44,828 --> 01:01:45,829
<i>Ciao.</i>

1283
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:53,034
Hmm?

1284
01:01:53,588 --> 01:01:54,828
Bastard.

1285
01:02:03,467 --> 01:02:04,593
No luck?

1286
01:02:04,707 --> 01:02:05,833
No.

1287
01:02:06,707 --> 01:02:08,550
You see, dear,
we're all too old now.

1288
01:02:08,627 --> 01:02:09,753
Oh, shut up.

1289
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:12,637
Come on, Eddy!
It's my birthday.

1290
01:02:12,707 --> 01:02:14,595
Come on, come on.

1291
01:02:14,666 --> 01:02:16,031
Oh!

1292
01:02:20,586 --> 01:02:21,667
Enjoying yourself?

1293
01:02:21,786 --> 01:02:22,867
No.

1294
01:02:27,026 --> 01:02:30,154
<i>No, I'm young! I'm still young.
I'm not old.</i>

1295
01:02:30,585 --> 01:02:32,747
<i>I'm not old.
I'm still young.</i>

1296
01:02:33,025 --> 01:02:34,834
<i>Because 60 is the new 40!</i>

1297
01:02:35,025 --> 01:02:37,505
<i>Sixty is the new 40!</i>

1298
01:02:37,705 --> 01:02:39,867
<i>No! Not the sad feet!</i>

1299
01:02:45,784 --> 01:02:46,785
Oh, ow! Ow.

1300
01:02:46,864 --> 01:02:47,865
Careful!

1301
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:50,670
With your reputation
for galumphing into people,

1302
01:02:50,744 --> 01:02:52,633
we don't want you to
trip over the Duchess.

1303
01:02:54,544 --> 01:02:55,591
What is that?

1304
01:02:55,744 --> 01:02:56,870
She's the Dowager Baroness

1305
01:02:56,944 --> 01:03:00,743
Lubliana Thysen von
Rothschild und Muck.

1306
01:03:05,743 --> 01:03:08,508
Pats, Pats, Pats, Pats, Pats.

1307
01:03:09,183 --> 01:03:13,187
That is the richest woman
in the world.

1308
01:03:14,662 --> 01:03:16,187
Darling, that...

1309
01:03:16,662 --> 01:03:20,189
is the richest woman
in the world!

1310
01:03:22,182 --> 01:03:23,991
No, Eddy, no, no, Eddy, no!

1311
01:03:24,102 --> 01:03:25,911
Yes, yes, yes.
Just come on.

1312
01:03:26,782 --> 01:03:27,942
Oi! Where are
you two off to?

1313
01:03:28,061 --> 01:03:29,267
Laundry. You come, too.

1314
01:03:33,061 --> 01:03:35,517
<i>Reports from
a source close to the investigation</i>

1315
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:37,862
<i>suggest Edina Monsoon
may have fled the country.</i>

1316
01:03:37,941 --> 01:03:38,942
For you.
Ooh.

1317
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:43,741
Gran?

1318
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:45,942
<i>Oh, hello, Saffy.
Is Mum there?</i>

1319
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:48,944
Yes, your mother
and Patsy are here.

1320
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:50,824
<i>What about Lola?</i>

1321
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:52,431
Is she with them?

1322
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:53,951
<i>Well, she was, dear.</i>

1323
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,908
Oh, my goodness. I must go.
Shirley Bassey is arriving...

1324
01:03:58,099 --> 01:03:59,942
any minute now.

1325
01:04:07,939 --> 01:04:10,067
<i>The minute
you walked in the joint</i>

1326
01:04:10,939 --> 01:04:14,021
<i>I could see you were
a man of distinction</i>

1327
01:04:14,138 --> 01:04:15,185
<i>A real big spender</i>

1328
01:04:15,298 --> 01:04:16,629
Very nice.

1329
01:04:16,778 --> 01:04:19,588
<i>Good lookin', so refined</i>

1330
01:04:19,778 --> 01:04:23,146
<i>Say, wouldn't you like to know
what's goin' on in my mind?</i>

1331
01:04:23,338 --> 01:04:25,227
<i>So let me get right to the point</i>

1332
01:04:26,098 --> 01:04:28,623
<i>I don't pop my cork
for every man I see</i>

1333
01:04:28,977 --> 01:04:30,217
May we join you?

1334
01:04:30,337 --> 01:04:31,577
Who are you?

1335
01:04:31,977 --> 01:04:33,741
I am Edina.

1336
01:04:34,257 --> 01:04:36,988
May I introduce my brother Pat?

1337
01:04:37,097 --> 01:04:39,304
<i>Spend a little time with me</i>

1338
01:04:40,137 --> 01:04:42,742
Stone. Pat Stone.

1339
01:04:45,856 --> 01:04:47,824
Do you know who I am?

1340
01:04:48,136 --> 01:04:50,582
Dowager Baroness Lubliana

1341
01:04:50,656 --> 01:04:53,136
Thysen von Rothschild und Muck.

1342
01:04:53,616 --> 01:04:56,858
So you're not partying
with all the other men?

1343
01:04:57,055 --> 01:04:58,659
No, he likes older women.

1344
01:04:58,855 --> 01:05:00,823
Not those girls.

1345
01:05:04,015 --> 01:05:07,622
We want a proper shuffle,
no fuzzing the cards.

1346
01:05:11,694 --> 01:05:13,025
<i>With me</i>

1347
01:05:19,334 --> 01:05:22,781
<i>Spring was never
waiting for us, boy</i>

1348
01:05:22,854 --> 01:05:25,823
<i>It ran one step ahead</i>

1349
01:05:25,893 --> 01:05:27,975
<i>As we followed in the dance</i>

1350
01:05:33,093 --> 01:05:37,223
<i>Between the parted pages
and were pressed</i>

1351
01:05:37,373 --> 01:05:41,741
<i>In love's hot fevered iron
like a striped...</i>

1352
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:57,821
French.

1353
01:05:58,331 --> 01:05:59,821
Pat Stone.

1354
01:06:02,211 --> 01:06:03,212
Yeah.

1355
01:06:04,371 --> 01:06:05,372
Yeah.

1356
01:06:06,131 --> 01:06:07,132
Oui.

1357
01:06:07,211 --> 01:06:08,736
Okay.

1358
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:21,296
Yes, absolutely.

1359
01:06:24,090 --> 01:06:25,250
Now.

1360
01:06:25,689 --> 01:06:26,690
Oh!

1361
01:06:32,849 --> 01:06:35,375
Oh, what a rainbow
world we live in.

1362
01:06:45,848 --> 01:06:50,092
Till death do you part,
till death do you part.

1363
01:06:50,248 --> 01:06:52,091
How long do you
think it will be?

1364
01:06:52,248 --> 01:06:54,978
Let Lubey have her moment.
Come on, sweetie, be cool.

1365
01:06:55,167 --> 01:06:56,453
My darling Pat.

1366
01:06:56,767 --> 01:06:58,337
You feeling all right?

1367
01:07:00,727 --> 01:07:03,970
<i>MacArthur's Park
is melting in the dark</i>

1368
01:07:04,047 --> 01:07:08,132
<i>All the sweet
green icing flowing down</i>

1369
01:07:12,406 --> 01:07:14,374
Still got it, hasn't it,
the Riviera?

1370
01:07:14,446 --> 01:07:16,892
Yeah, it's still got it.

1371
01:07:17,886 --> 01:07:19,012
Where are we going?

1372
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:21,334
The Grand-Hotel
Du Cap-Ferrat.

1373
01:07:22,686 --> 01:07:25,291
Oh, Eddy, the six finest words
in the English language.

1374
01:07:26,965 --> 01:07:28,296
Are we booked in?

1375
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:31,210
No need, it's mine.
I own it.

1376
01:07:49,164 --> 01:07:51,451
I'm so happy.-
Are you?

1377
01:07:51,884 --> 01:07:53,772
Tremendously happy.

1378
01:07:54,043 --> 01:07:56,171
You and I are married.

1379
01:07:56,763 --> 01:07:58,049
So...

1380
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:01,933
So...

1381
01:08:02,843 --> 01:08:04,004
happy?

1382
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,927
Tremendously.

1383
01:08:06,323 --> 01:08:09,451
Now it's late, darling.
Bed beckons.

1384
01:08:10,922 --> 01:08:13,926
Does it? Um, another drink?
Perhaps some nibbles?

1385
01:08:14,162 --> 01:08:15,926
I'm tired.

1386
01:08:16,362 --> 01:08:18,171
Oh, I'm tired, too.

1387
01:08:18,482 --> 01:08:20,450
Would you mind if I retired?

1388
01:08:20,522 --> 01:08:22,365
Stay and drink with your sister.

1389
01:08:22,801 --> 01:08:25,008
I don't mind.
Enjoy the evening.

1390
01:08:27,921 --> 01:08:29,810
And thank you.

1391
01:08:30,161 --> 01:08:31,162
I may be...

1392
01:08:31,241 --> 01:08:32,497
the richest woman in the world,

1393
01:08:32,521 --> 01:08:36,492
but also sometimes
the loneliest.

1394
01:08:36,961 --> 01:08:38,849
On, Lubey.

1395
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,800
Am I interrupting something?
No, darling.

1396
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,047
<i>Au</i> revoir.

1397
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:51,721
Oh, Eddy.

1398
01:08:52,639 --> 01:08:54,562
Little Lubey, Eds.
Mmm.

1399
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:57,043
Is a darling.

1400
01:08:57,799 --> 01:09:00,040
Wasabi nut, wasabi.

1401
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:07,968
Thank you, darling.

1402
01:09:08,398 --> 01:09:09,843
How are you feeling?

1403
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:11,399
Tremendously happy.

1404
01:09:15,878 --> 01:09:17,448
What if they've found Bubble?

1405
01:09:17,878 --> 01:09:20,245
Darling, don't think about it.
They can't tie it to us.

1406
01:09:20,518 --> 01:09:22,246
Yeah, yeah.

1407
01:09:23,517 --> 01:09:26,088
Eddy, living well
is the best revenge.

1408
01:09:29,397 --> 01:09:31,240
This could be our life,
couldn't it?

1409
01:09:31,437 --> 01:09:34,919
This is our life.
We're not going back.

1410
01:09:35,117 --> 01:09:37,437
And what's to miss?
Just things.

1411
01:09:38,436 --> 01:09:40,484
You've never
had attachments, have you?

1412
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:42,526
They're not attachments.

1413
01:09:42,596 --> 01:09:45,440
They're parasites,
ticks, danglers.

1414
01:09:46,116 --> 01:09:48,164
You can buy new things.

1415
01:09:51,435 --> 01:09:52,436
Hmm.

1416
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:55,559
We're not going back.

1417
01:09:56,475 --> 01:09:57,636
Do you want vodka in that?

1418
01:09:57,755 --> 01:09:58,961
Yeah.

1419
01:10:05,275 --> 01:10:07,561
<i>I can't believe you can
afford a place like this.</i>

1420
01:10:08,154 --> 01:10:12,284
Well, I do all our accounts and I've
been overpaying meself for years.

1421
01:10:12,594 --> 01:10:16,155
'Twas nowt but a wormhole
when I bought it, though.

1422
01:10:16,474 --> 01:10:18,920
She's an idiot and she
tried to kill you, remember.

1423
01:10:18,994 --> 01:10:19,995
I know, but...

1424
01:10:20,874 --> 01:10:22,113
I called the police.

1425
01:10:22,273 --> 01:10:26,164
They will find her.
And she will get...

1426
01:10:45,072 --> 01:10:46,961
Hello, Saffy, dear.
Gran.

1427
01:10:47,192 --> 01:10:49,593
Funniest thing...
I was wrong.

1428
01:10:49,872 --> 01:10:51,157
Lola's not here?

1429
01:10:51,471 --> 01:10:54,077
It wasn't Shirley Bassey,
it was a lookalike.

1430
01:10:54,271 --> 01:10:56,000
Gran, where is Lola?

1431
01:10:56,191 --> 01:10:58,193
I have no idea, dear.

1432
01:10:58,631 --> 01:11:00,076
Come on, Gloria.

1433
01:11:01,311 --> 01:11:02,676
Have you got the balls?

1434
01:11:04,631 --> 01:11:05,677
Saff!

1435
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:07,515
Emma. Lola!

1436
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:09,151
Are you all right?

1437
01:11:09,310 --> 01:11:10,357
I'm fine.

1438
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:14,191
I found her cleaning my room.
They gave her to housekeeping.

1439
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:15,351
I'm so glad you're safe.

1440
01:11:15,430 --> 01:11:16,431
Mmm-hmm.

1441
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:18,677
I love you.

1442
01:11:20,349 --> 01:11:21,635
Thanks.

1443
01:11:24,309 --> 01:11:26,038
What are you doing here?

1444
01:11:26,229 --> 01:11:27,515
Oh, it's a long story.

1445
01:11:27,589 --> 01:11:30,513
Lulu called the police because
I saw your mother here.

1446
01:11:31,029 --> 01:11:32,030
Lulu?

1447
01:11:33,669 --> 01:11:34,999
Nick?

1448
01:11:35,228 --> 01:11:36,354
What?

1449
01:11:36,548 --> 01:11:37,595
Oh, uh...

1450
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:40,239
Hang on.
Can you look after Lola?

1451
01:11:40,548 --> 01:11:43,552
Of course. I won't
be long, I promise.

1452
01:11:49,108 --> 01:11:51,394
Nick, I found Lola.
I found your mother.

1453
01:11:51,587 --> 01:11:52,643
I don't care about my mother.

1454
01:11:52,667 --> 01:11:54,669
Yes, you do. Drive!

1455
01:11:56,587 --> 01:11:57,588
<i>Allez.</i>

1456
01:11:58,067 --> 01:11:59,148
Go. Please.

1457
01:12:09,146 --> 01:12:10,322
I don't normally like the stuff

1458
01:12:10,346 --> 01:12:13,031
you get in hotel lobbies,
but this is quite nice.

1459
01:12:13,266 --> 01:12:14,392
It's fabulous.

1460
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:18,272
Oh, I could get used to this.

1461
01:12:19,265 --> 01:12:21,029
I am used to it.

1462
01:12:22,345 --> 01:12:23,426
Where's the wife?

1463
01:12:23,625 --> 01:12:25,753
She's using the funicular.
She'll be hours.

1464
01:12:27,745 --> 01:12:29,190
<i>I tell you something, Eddy.</i>

1465
01:12:29,425 --> 01:12:32,031
Little Kate Moss, thank you.

1466
01:12:33,705 --> 01:12:35,433
Oh. I mean, darling...

1467
01:12:35,624 --> 01:12:37,274
this could be the first day

1468
01:12:37,424 --> 01:12:38,710
of the start of the whole days

1469
01:12:38,784 --> 01:12:40,627
of the rest of our lives,
couldn't it, really?

1470
01:12:41,304 --> 01:12:44,194
Thanks to Lubey.
Yeah, thanks to Lubey.

1471
01:12:45,304 --> 01:12:47,750
Are you growing
attached to Lubey, darling?

1472
01:12:48,104 --> 01:12:50,310
We are just waiting for her
to change her will and die.

1473
01:12:50,503 --> 01:12:51,743
Oh, Eddy.

1474
01:12:51,823 --> 01:12:53,268
I mean, has she
changed her will yet?

1475
01:12:53,423 --> 01:12:57,064
All in good time, Eds,
all in good time.

1476
01:12:58,423 --> 01:13:00,630
Oh, I say. Hello.

1477
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:08,784
I'll just go and check that out

1478
01:13:12,342 --> 01:13:14,344
Saffy, listen.
I'm not coming home,

1479
01:13:14,422 --> 01:13:15,469
so stop phoning me!

1480
01:13:15,662 --> 01:13:17,232
I've got the rest
of my life to live

1481
01:13:17,302 --> 01:13:19,144
and I'm going to live it.

1482
01:13:19,341 --> 01:13:22,663
I'm done with all of you,
so forget me.

1483
01:13:22,741 --> 01:13:24,345
Just forget me.

1484
01:13:25,341 --> 01:13:26,752
<i>I'm walking down the road</i>

1485
01:13:27,221 --> 01:13:29,223
<i>Looking at trees</i>

1486
01:13:29,621 --> 01:13:31,783
<i>All the people going by</i>

1487
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:35,781
<i>They say "How do you look
so good today, Eddy?"</i>

1488
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:39,110
<i>I say
"I don't know. I don't know"</i>

1489
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:46,822
So...

1490
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:49,821
have you been working here long?

1491
01:13:51,659 --> 01:13:54,139
You look pretty...
Oh, the mustache.

1492
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:56,823
You're pretty gorgeous, too.

1493
01:14:10,538 --> 01:14:12,540
Eddy, Eddy! Eddy!

1494
01:14:12,858 --> 01:14:14,303
Eddy!
What, darling?

1495
01:14:14,498 --> 01:14:16,500
The pigs, the fuzz...
your face!

1496
01:14:16,858 --> 01:14:18,817
We've got to leave. The
pigs, the fuzz, your face!

1497
01:14:19,857 --> 01:14:21,302
The pigs, the pigs!

1498
01:14:21,377 --> 01:14:22,458
Quick!

1499
01:14:22,577 --> 01:14:24,297
Come on, Eddy, we've got
to get out of here.

1500
01:14:25,177 --> 01:14:27,464
Cover your face.
Just hide, hide.

1501
01:14:38,856 --> 01:14:41,382
<i>Excusez-moi.
Hello.</i>

1502
01:14:41,856 --> 01:14:43,142
<i>Excusez-moi, madame?</i>

1503
01:14:43,256 --> 01:14:44,542
I say!

1504
01:14:44,856 --> 01:14:46,142
<i>Excusez-moi, madame?</i>

1505
01:14:46,256 --> 01:14:47,495
Can I help you?

1506
01:15:04,334 --> 01:15:06,905
Quick, quick, quick,
darling! Get in!

1507
01:15:14,254 --> 01:15:15,585
<i>Allez, allez!</i>

1508
01:15:15,694 --> 01:15:16,933
Lam allez-ing.

1509
01:15:21,613 --> 01:15:23,502
Go left, go left!

1510
01:15:28,213 --> 01:15:29,214
Keep going, Eddy!

1511
01:15:33,292 --> 01:15:34,293
Go left!

1512
01:15:34,372 --> 01:15:36,773
At the end, go left.

1513
01:15:47,651 --> 01:15:49,415
- Left.
- We've been left!

1514
01:15:51,251 --> 01:15:52,855
What's that pedal?
Press that pedal.

1515
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:56,542
That pedal!
That pedal there!

1516
01:15:56,611 --> 01:15:58,051
Oh. Oh.

1517
01:15:58,291 --> 01:15:59,941
No, not that pedal.

1518
01:16:00,331 --> 01:16:01,616
Not that pedal.

1519
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:03,611
Watch out!

1520
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:07,457
- Oh, God!
<i>- Merci.</i>

1521
01:16:16,289 --> 01:16:17,654
That was quite nice.

1522
01:16:18,809 --> 01:16:20,299
We've lost them, Eddy.

1523
01:16:20,449 --> 01:16:22,338
Shall I keep going?
Yeah! We're not giving in!

1524
01:16:23,449 --> 01:16:25,372
Watch out!

1525
01:16:25,449 --> 01:16:27,577
<i>Bloody bicyclettes!</i>

1526
01:16:28,809 --> 01:16:30,970
We're not going back.

1527
01:16:34,808 --> 01:16:36,572
Brake, Eddy!

1528
01:16:40,368 --> 01:16:42,450
Oh, God! Whoa!

1529
01:16:48,407 --> 01:16:49,647
She could be anywhere.

1530
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:00,689
Bubble, you're alive!

1531
01:17:01,006 --> 01:17:03,850
Welcome to my humble abode.

1532
01:17:04,326 --> 01:17:06,613
Lulu? What are you
doing here?

1533
01:17:06,846 --> 01:17:08,371
I want to see you pay.

1534
01:17:08,446 --> 01:17:09,493
Mum!

1535
01:17:09,686 --> 01:17:11,415
- Saff.
- Oh, shit.

1536
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:12,812
Get out!

1537
01:17:13,006 --> 01:17:14,337
No, no.

1538
01:17:14,606 --> 01:17:15,686
Don't be ridiculous.

1539
01:17:15,765 --> 01:17:17,608
Nick's come to take you
back for the hearing.

1540
01:17:17,805 --> 01:17:18,852
Eddy?

1541
01:17:19,365 --> 01:17:21,015
No, we're not
going back, darling.

1542
01:17:21,485 --> 01:17:23,010
Mum, get out of the water!

1543
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:28,375
Eddy, we're sinking.

1544
01:17:28,525 --> 01:17:30,686
Do get out of the pool,
Mrs. Monsoon.

1545
01:17:30,844 --> 01:17:32,448
I would rather die

1546
01:17:32,524 --> 01:17:34,606
than go back to
all those hating faces!

1547
01:17:35,604 --> 01:17:37,606
I mean, look at me, darling.

1548
01:17:38,484 --> 01:17:42,045
All I've ever wanted
was not to be fat...

1549
01:17:42,484 --> 01:17:43,770
and old.

1550
01:17:44,044 --> 01:17:47,490
You know, darling. To just
keep the party going.

1551
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:49,492
Now here I am.

1552
01:17:50,363 --> 01:17:53,890
Just fat and old and hated...

1553
01:17:54,363 --> 01:17:55,888
and nothing.

1554
01:17:56,443 --> 01:17:57,808
I'm getting in.

1555
01:17:57,883 --> 01:18:01,409
Darling, I know you think
I don't know who I am...

1556
01:18:01,562 --> 01:18:03,724
and what I've done.

1557
01:18:04,522 --> 01:18:06,889
But I do, darling, I do.

1558
01:18:08,402 --> 01:18:10,404
I'm disgusting.

1559
01:18:10,962 --> 01:18:13,886
Always wanting everything,
always taking more.

1560
01:18:14,761 --> 01:18:16,525
Wearing stupid...

1561
01:18:16,761 --> 01:18:19,048
ridiculous small, small, small,

1562
01:18:19,121 --> 01:18:21,522
stylish, stupid,
ridiculous clothing!

1563
01:18:21,801 --> 01:18:23,963
You think it's hard
living with me,

1564
01:18:24,041 --> 01:18:26,089
try being at this end, darling.

1565
01:18:27,521 --> 01:18:29,045
And it is all about
me, isn't it?

1566
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,406
It has been all about me.

1567
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,090
And me, Eds.

1568
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,570
Darling...

1569
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,770
I've never given you
the love that you deserve.

1570
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:47,808
Before I go...

1571
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:50,605
l want you to know
that I love you.

1572
01:18:53,799 --> 01:18:55,688
I love you, Mum.

1573
01:18:55,879 --> 01:18:57,881
And Lola, sweetheart.

1574
01:18:58,119 --> 01:19:00,439
And Pats.

1575
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:04,442
It's all right.

1576
01:19:05,678 --> 01:19:07,726
You can let me go, darling.

1577
01:19:09,838 --> 01:19:11,567
Let me go.
I'm going to join Kate

1578
01:19:11,678 --> 01:19:14,840
in the watery grave.
Let me go.

1579
01:19:16,037 --> 01:19:17,801
Kate's not dead.

1580
01:19:17,917 --> 01:19:18,998
What?
What?

1581
01:19:19,077 --> 01:19:21,045
What?
She lives!

1582
01:19:25,477 --> 01:19:26,478
Kate!

1583
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:28,923
Jean Paul.
Where's the party?

1584
01:19:29,116 --> 01:19:31,164
The party is wherever
you are, Kate!

1585
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:32,802
I lost everyone.

1586
01:19:32,916 --> 01:19:36,079
Sometimes it's good
to have lost some people.

1587
01:19:36,476 --> 01:19:38,638
You stay with me. We make
another little party.

1588
01:19:40,196 --> 01:19:43,961
You stupid, bloody,
bollocking idiot!

1589
01:19:44,155 --> 01:19:46,157
Why didn't you say that before?

1590
01:19:46,595 --> 01:19:49,758
I just humiliated myself!

1591
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:06,915
Hi, Kate, darling.

1592
01:20:06,994 --> 01:20:09,565
No, I'm working
from Nobu this week.

1593
01:20:09,754 --> 01:20:10,880
The world is at your feet

1594
01:20:10,954 --> 01:20:12,557
and I can make them stay there.

1595
01:20:12,753 --> 01:20:13,879
Game-changing reinvention...

1596
01:20:13,953 --> 01:20:16,524
You are the new face
of Louis Vuitton menswear.

1597
01:20:16,673 --> 01:20:17,674
<i>I</i> know!

1598
01:20:18,193 --> 01:20:19,274
No, I've done a big dump.

1599
01:20:19,513 --> 01:20:20,594
I only represent you now.

1600
01:20:20,673 --> 01:20:22,516
Got rid of Emma Bunton and Lulu.

1601
01:20:22,673 --> 01:20:25,040
I'm gonna be a big cheese
in the Big Apple.

1602
01:20:25,633 --> 01:20:27,919
I am a big cheese!
Thank you, darling!

1603
01:20:33,192 --> 01:20:34,637
We are living
the dream, darling.

1604
01:20:34,712 --> 01:20:35,918
We are, darling.

1605
01:20:38,992 --> 01:20:41,915
Here I am, Edina Monsoon,
on my way to...

1606
01:20:42,191 --> 01:20:43,795
my book launch.
Yeah.

1607
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:49,671
Oh, darling, I lost
my pelvic floor on takeoff.

1608
01:20:50,551 --> 01:20:52,631
Don't worry. We'll
pick it up on the way back.

1609
01:20:52,791 --> 01:20:55,681
<i>Fashion icon Kate Moss has
been found safe and well...</i>

1610
01:20:56,271 --> 01:20:59,877
<i>five days after falling
from a balcony into the river.</i>

1611
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:01,993
<i>It's been reported
she is resting</i>

1612
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:04,198
<i>at the home of her
new P.R., Eddy Mon...</i>

1613
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:07,839
Why is Kate Moss still here?

1614
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:09,834
Mum's doing her P.R. now.

1615
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:11,952
Apparently, she's never
been so in demand

1616
01:21:12,029 --> 01:21:13,269
since she went missing.

1617
01:21:13,709 --> 01:21:15,234
So, darling, the plan is

1618
01:21:15,309 --> 01:21:17,710
we throw a huge party
in Hyde Park.

1619
01:21:17,949 --> 01:21:20,190
Like a "Welcome Back,
Kate" party.

1620
01:21:21,709 --> 01:21:24,189
And darling,
we should get Bollinger

1621
01:21:24,269 --> 01:21:26,714
to give us a whole vintage.
A whole vintage, darling.

1622
01:21:26,948 --> 01:21:28,950
Eddy, you'll want
to wear couture.

1623
01:21:29,228 --> 01:21:31,276
Yeah, yeah. No Stella.

1624
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:35,952
Am I still sending all the bills
to Baroness Lublubliana...

1625
01:21:36,188 --> 01:21:38,589
Rothschild Von Thy...

1626
01:21:38,828 --> 01:21:41,273
Mum, no!
You can't do that.

1627
01:21:41,707 --> 01:21:43,277
No, Eddy, no, no, no.

1628
01:21:43,707 --> 01:21:45,994
Think of our life, our dream!

1629
01:21:46,267 --> 01:21:48,031
Don't let this
repellent little shrew

1630
01:21:48,107 --> 01:21:49,871
take it away from us.

1631
01:21:50,107 --> 01:21:51,836
Every time our life
hits a good patch,

1632
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:54,592
this miserable piece
of flesh ruins it.

1633
01:21:54,987 --> 01:21:56,988
If you don't tell her, I will!

1634
01:21:57,626 --> 01:22:00,755
Oh, you little
bitch troll from hell.

1635
01:22:01,986 --> 01:22:03,988
No!

1636
01:22:20,145 --> 01:22:22,352
Lubey, I have something
to tell you.

1637
01:22:23,625 --> 01:22:25,036
I'm not a man.

1638
01:22:25,304 --> 01:22:26,749
I know.

1639
01:22:27,144 --> 01:22:29,306
And I'm not a woman.

1640
01:22:40,023 --> 01:22:42,788
Well, you don't mind
sleeping with him/her?

1641
01:22:43,743 --> 01:22:46,349
Does it mean you don't need the strap-on?
I don't know.

1642
01:22:50,183 --> 01:22:52,789
<i>Wheel's on fire</i>

1643
01:22:53,143 --> 01:22:58,228
<i>Rolling down the road</i>

1644
01:22:59,022 --> 01:23:03,311
<i>Best notify my next of kin</i>

1645
01:23:03,782 --> 01:23:08,822
<i>This wheel shall explode!</i>

1646
01:23:09,661 --> 01:23:13,188
<i>If your memory serves you well</i>

1647
01:23:14,021 --> 01:23:17,025
<i>I was going to
confiscate my lace</i>

1648
01:23:17,421 --> 01:23:22,188
<i>And wrap it up
in a sailor's knot</i>

1649
01:23:22,301 --> 01:23:25,190
<i>And hide it in your case</i>

1650
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:30,264
<i>If I knew for sure
that it was yours</i>

1651
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:33,827
<i>But it was oh, so hard to tell</i>

1652
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:38,466
<i>But you knew
that we would meet again</i>

1653
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:41,384
<i>If your memory served you well</i>

1654
01:23:43,899 --> 01:23:46,425
<i>wheel's on fire</i>

1655
01:23:47,099 --> 01:23:52,742
<i>Rolling down the road</i>

1656
01:23:52,979 --> 01:23:56,983
<i>Best notify my next of kin</i>

1657
01:23:57,418 --> 01:24:02,743
<i>This wheel shall explode!</i>

1658
01:24:03,058 --> 01:24:07,143
<i>If your memory serves you well</i>

1659
01:24:07,898 --> 01:24:10,901
You'll remember you're the one

1660
01:24:11,057 --> 01:24:15,745
<i>That called on me
to call on them</i>

1661
01:24:16,137 --> 01:24:18,902
<i>To get you your favors done</i>

1662
01:24:20,217 --> 01:24:23,061
<i>And after every plan had failed</i>

1663
01:24:24,096 --> 01:24:27,259
<i>And there was
nothing more to tell</i>

1664
01:24:28,376 --> 01:24:32,176
<i>You knew
that we would meet again</i>

1665
01:24:32,256 --> 01:24:35,419
<i>If your memory served you well</i>

1666
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:40,336
<i>wheel's on fire</i>

1667
01:24:40,935 --> 01:24:46,499
<i>Rolling down the road</i>

1668
01:24:46,855 --> 01:24:50,985
<i>Best notify my next of kin</i>

1669
01:24:51,335 --> 01:24:57,137
<i>This wheel shall explode!</i>

1670
01:26:12,929 --> 01:26:15,580
<i>You talk like Marlene Dietrich</i>

1671
01:26:16,449 --> 01:26:19,851
<i>And you dance
like Zizi Jeanmaire</i>

1672
01:26:20,529 --> 01:26:24,010
<i>Your clothes
are all made by Balmain</i>

1673
01:26:24,528 --> 01:26:27,816
<i>And there's diamonds
and pearls in your hair</i>

1674
01:26:27,888 --> 01:26:28,889
<i>Yes, there are</i>

1675
01:26:30,848 --> 01:26:34,136
<i>You live in a fancy apartment</i>

1676
01:26:34,968 --> 01:26:38,096
<i>Off
the Boulevard Saint-Michel</i>

1677
01:26:39,047 --> 01:26:43,018
<i>Where you keep
your Rolling Stones records</i>

1678
01:26:43,087 --> 01:26:45,977
<i>And your friend of Sacha Distel</i>

1679
01:26:46,047 --> 01:26:47,048
<i>Yes, you do</i>

1680
01:26:49,207 --> 01:26:52,574
<i>Oh, but where do you
go to, my lovely</i>

1681
01:26:53,886 --> 01:26:56,537
<i>When you're alone in your bed?</i>

1682
01:26:57,966 --> 01:27:01,209
<i>Tell me the thoughts
that surround you</i>

1683
01:27:02,046 --> 01:27:04,617
<i>I want to look inside your head</i>

1684
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:05,887
<i>Yes, I do</i>

1685
01:27:07,885 --> 01:27:11,253
<i>I've seen
all your qualifications</i>

1686
01:27:11,925 --> 01:27:15,327
<i>You got from the Sorbonne</i>

1687
01:27:16,045 --> 01:27:19,094
<i>And the painting
you stole from Picasso</i>

1688
01:27:20,245 --> 01:27:23,248
<i>Your loveliness goes on and on</i>

1689
01:27:23,324 --> 01:27:24,405
<i>Yes, it does</i>

1690
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:29,533
<i>Oh, when you go
on your summer vacation</i>

1691
01:27:30,404 --> 01:27:33,374
<i>You go to Juan-les-Pins</i>

1692
01:27:34,404 --> 01:27:38,044
<i>With your carefully designed
topless swimsuit</i>

1693
01:27:38,603 --> 01:27:41,652
<i>You get an even suntan</i>

1694
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:44,085
<i>On your back and on your legs</i>

1695
01:27:44,683 --> 01:27:48,130
<i>And when the snow falls
you're found in St. Moritz</i>

1696
01:27:48,923 --> 01:27:52,005
<i>With the others of the jet-set</i>

1697
01:27:52,602 --> 01:27:56,323
<i>And you sip your Napoleon brandy</i>

1698
01:27:57,162 --> 01:27:59,927
<i>But you never get your lips wet</i>

1699
01:28:00,002 --> 01:28:01,242
<i>No, you don't</i>

1700
01:28:03,162 --> 01:28:07,052
<i>But where do you go to my lovely</i>

1701
01:28:07,521 --> 01:28:10,684
<i>When you're alone in your bed?</i>

1702
01:28:11,441 --> 01:28:14,570
<i>Won't you tell me the
thoughts that surround you?</i>

1703
01:28:15,601 --> 01:28:18,525
<i>I want to look inside your head</i>

1704
01:28:18,601 --> 01:28:19,602
<i>Yes, I do</i>

1705
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:24,723
<i>Your name
it is heard in high places</i>

1706
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:29,042
<i>You know the Aga Khan</i>

1707
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:33,048
<i>He sent you a racehorse
for Christmas</i>

1708
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:39,159
<i>And you keep it just for fun
for a laugh, ha-ha-ha</i>

1709
01:28:40,119 --> 01:28:43,248
<i>They say
that when you get married</i>

1710
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:47,402
<i>It'll be to a millionaire</i>

1711
01:28:48,319 --> 01:28:51,481
<i>But they don't realize
where you came from</i>

1712
01:28:52,318 --> 01:28:55,367
<i>And I wonder if they really care</i>

1713
01:28:55,438 --> 01:28:56,769
<i>Or give a damn</i>

1714
01:28:58,678 --> 01:29:02,285
<i>Where do you go to, my lovely</i>

1715
01:29:03,038 --> 01:29:06,007
<i>When you're alone in your bed?</i>

1716
01:29:07,157 --> 01:29:10,479
<i>Tell me the thoughts
that surround you</i>

1717
01:29:11,197 --> 01:29:14,121
<i>I want to look inside your head</i>

1718
01:29:14,197 --> 01:29:15,437
<i>Yes, I do</i>

1719
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:20,680
<i>I remember
the back streets of Naples</i>

1720
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:24,758
<i>Two children begging in rags</i>

1721
01:29:25,396 --> 01:29:29,037
<i>Both touched
with a burning ambition</i>

1722
01:29:30,036 --> 01:29:32,721
<i>To shake off
their lowly-borne tags</i>

1723
01:29:32,796 --> 01:29:34,445
<i>They try</i>

1724
01:29:35,315 --> 01:29:39,161
<i>So look into my face
Marie-Claire</i>

1725
01:29:40,195 --> 01:29:43,199
<i>And remember just who you are</i>

1726
01:29:44,195 --> 01:29:47,756
<i>Then go and forget me forever</i>

1727
01:29:48,395 --> 01:29:52,399
<i>But I know you still bear
the scar, deep inside</i>

1728
01:29:52,514 --> 01:29:53,720
<i>Yes, you do</i>

1729
01:29:54,434 --> 01:29:58,234
<i>I know where you go to my lovely</i>

1730
01:29:59,234 --> 01:30:02,204
<i>When you're alone in your bed</i>

1731
01:30:03,274 --> 01:30:06,402
<i>I know the thoughts
that surround you</i>

1732
01:30:07,193 --> 01:30:13,724
<i>'Cause I can look
inside your head</i>

1733
01:30:35,471 --> 01:30:38,600
People should go back to
watching videos of kittens.

1734
01:30:38,671 --> 01:30:40,355
Now bugger off.
