00:00:48,374 --> 00:00:52,645
Listen, can you help me?
I've got a flat tyre.

2
00:00:53,872 --> 00:00:55,169
Thanks.

3
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:09,784
You're so kind.

4
00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:12,121
What's that?

5
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:32,409
Help!

6
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,812
Help!

7
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:54,040
Help!

13
00:06:13,044 --> 00:06:15,213
Hi! What a terrible journey.

14
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:18,322
You don't call me for months
and then all of a sudden.

15
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:20,351
What's this all about?

16
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:24,828
You're hurting me!
You're still the same.

17
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,542
What happened to your car?

18
00:06:28,615 --> 00:06:30,136
It's been like that for two months.

19
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:31,323
Damn!

20
00:06:40,621 --> 00:06:41,847
Your face looks tired?

21
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:46,246
You know I have to sleep at
least 12 hours till I'm fine.

22
00:06:46,736 --> 00:06:49,997
- The usual story.
- No, Lucia...

23
00:06:50,347 --> 00:06:54,467
I don't believe you. This time you've
really got to hold it together.

24
00:07:24,315 --> 00:07:27,391
- Thanks, Goodbye.
- Good Evening, Miss.

25
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:35,073
Please.

26
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,293
Thanks.

27
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:47,751
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

28
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,739
- Such bad weather.
- Yeah.

29
00:08:38,196 --> 00:08:39,646
You scared me!

30
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:42,607
My daughter, I could lose my soul

31
00:08:42,684 --> 00:08:46,830
but I'd never spill a drop!

32
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:51,028
Doctor, you're always joking around.
You're such a nice person.

33
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:56,099
At my age girls like you
always tell me I'm a really nice guy.

34
00:08:56,294 --> 00:09:00,305
Ah! Dear daughter,
is Eleonora ready to play cards?

35
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,776
She'll be here in a moment.

36
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:06,534
But you need to wake up a little
first if you want to win.

37
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,560
But I'm so lucky in love!
Where is Edmund?

38
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:13,064
He's next door, with Sarah.

39
00:09:13,184 --> 00:09:15,095
Has he finished impressing
his girlfirend?

40
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,930
Yes, she's gone.
Such a lovely lady!

41
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:22,891
These girls do a job I would
never do If I were a woman...

42
00:09:23,327 --> 00:09:26,745
Just imagining myself
naked like a worm

43
00:09:26,788 --> 00:09:28,093
in front of someone

44
00:09:28,124 --> 00:09:33,968
in order to be shot by this device which
makes me feel like it's about to explode

45
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:35,933
would make my blood freeze!

46
00:09:35,991 --> 00:09:37,249
Well, I would do it!

47
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:40,544
Oh, my dear,
be careful with the crysanthemums.

48
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:43,142
They need a constant
supply of cold water.

49
00:09:43,214 --> 00:09:47,146
Flowers are sensibile
creatures but also impotent.

50
00:09:47,923 --> 00:09:52,227
They need to be cured with
kindness and patience.

51
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,227
Damn, I can't see a thing.

52
00:10:25,854 --> 00:10:26,894
What's wrong?

53
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,042
I'm going to get a jug
of water for the guests.

54
00:10:29,437 --> 00:10:33,093
I'll get it, you can go to sleep.

55
00:10:59,294 --> 00:11:03,236
Sarah, you're so kind
wanting to help me.

56
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:07,176
Uncle, it was you who got
me into photography...

57
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:10,949
It's all I want to do now.

58
00:11:13,112 --> 00:11:16,114
- Such bad weather.
- Right.

59
00:11:17,231 --> 00:11:19,714
It sends shivers down my spine.
Oh, aunt is here.

60
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:21,383
Is the Doctor here yet?

61
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,312
I think so.
He's in the lounge, as usual.

62
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:28,093
So, the usual game tonight?

63
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,288
I'm tired.

64
00:11:31,147 --> 00:11:34,194
Me too, I'm so tired.
I'm going straight to bed.

65
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,795
Please excuse me tonight.

66
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:40,640
Goodnight Uncle.
Goodnight Eleonora.

67
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,595
Excuse me, is there
a mechanic in the area?

68
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,095
A mechanic? Haha! No, there
are no mechanics here.

69
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,231
- A telephone at least?
- Just look around you!

70
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:25,809
A token (for the phone) please.

71
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:31,832
Thanks.

72
00:12:49,195 --> 00:12:50,486
Hello?

73
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:54,236
It's me Giorgio.

74
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:59,163
Your jalopy broke down
and I was left outside in the rain!

75
00:13:00,397 --> 00:13:02,832
Yes, yes. I've got petrol.

76
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,441
I really don't understand
what's happening.

77
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:10,629
Hello? 
Giorgio, listen to me.

78
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,539
I'm not really sure.
Excuse me, where are we?

79
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,167
-In paradise! (Heaven)

80
00:13:16,192 --> 00:13:21,214
Hey! I'm not in the mood to joke around.
Can you tell me where I am?

81
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:25,818
You're on the provincial road,
about 30 kilometres from Rome.

82
00:13:26,795 --> 00:13:30,865
On the provincial, 
about 32 kilometres from Rome.

83
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:35,341
- Where are you calling from?
- It's some sort of bar.

84
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:40,079
We've even got guest rooms
with central heating.

85
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:48,086
Giorgio, please do me a favour and
come here as soon as possible.

86
00:13:50,374 --> 00:13:52,400
How can I Erica?

87
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,853
Ottavio can let you use his car.

88
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,220
Please, come quickly!

89
00:13:58,378 --> 00:14:03,548
Ottavio is not in Rome.
Surely there's a mechanic around?

90
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:06,573
It seems like there's
none around.

91
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:11,151
And then, at this late
hour, how will I find one?

92
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,221
Please, find a way to come here.

93
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:20,050
Listen Erica, it's impossible.
Ive got work to do.

94
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:22,581
I'll catch up with you
tomorrow morning.

95
00:14:22,837 --> 00:14:23,867
But Giorgio!

96
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,209
Don't be so childish.
I'll see you in the morning.

97
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:28,953
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

98
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:32,744
Imbecile!

99
00:14:38,823 --> 00:14:42,337
- Do you have any rooms?
- Like I said earlier...

100
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:43,974
I'll stay for the night.

101
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:47,254
My car is broken down
in the middle of the street.

102
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,353
- Could you help me movie it?
- Sure thing, miss.

103
00:15:27,331 --> 00:15:29,214
It's cold, isn't it?

104
00:15:33,902 --> 00:15:35,777
- Thank you.
- Don't mention ot.

105
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:37,823
I'll pay you now.

106
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:42,959
- Could you show me to the room?
- Come this way.

107
00:16:08,723 --> 00:16:09,911
Who is he?

108
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:13,840
My son. He was born
like that, poor boy...

109
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:16,177
but he doesn't
cause any trouble.

110
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:27,007
Here is your room,
it's the best in the house.

111
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,101
Yes, but it's so cold in here!

112
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,652
I'll get the fire started now.

113
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,813
- The fire is working well now!
- It's a lot warmer now, eh?

114
00:16:54,892 --> 00:16:56,987
Definetely!

115
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:02,843
Is there anything to eat?
I'm so hungry.

116
00:17:02,868 --> 00:17:04,812
There's very little
left, Miss...

117
00:17:04,884 --> 00:17:07,585
However I'll go and see
if there's a ham sandwich left.

118
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:10,663
Thank you.
It's better than nothing.

119
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm worried about my plants...

120
00:17:27,841 --> 00:17:30,216
It rained so hard today,
I didn't expect it.

121
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:33,974
Tomorrow I expect to have
a lot of work to do.

122
00:17:37,872 --> 00:17:41,867
What are you doing?
Don't tear them up like that! Why?

123
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,180
They aren't nice photos.

124
00:17:45,506 --> 00:17:49,172
A mother
never kills her offspring...

125
00:17:50,006 --> 00:17:54,434
My dear friend, you haven't
 been well for some time.

126
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:57,777
Try to relax.

127
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:02,082
I've told you many times to rest.

128
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:04,996
And also you my dear Lady.

129
00:18:05,338 --> 00:18:07,391
Alberto!

130
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:10,467
Yes, Sir?

131
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:13,520
Alberto, please accompany
Dr. Dalla to the door.

132
00:18:13,685 --> 00:18:15,367
Actually, drive him home...

133
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:19,634
The roads are very wet and dangerous.

134
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,572
- Sweet dreams.
- I'll see you tomorrow at breakfast.

135
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,480
You can tell me
all about your plants.

136
00:18:32,606 --> 00:18:37,000
Come on, drink up.
It'll do you good.

137
00:18:40,322 --> 00:18:42,831
Goodnight...Goodnight.

138
00:18:48,691 --> 00:18:53,170
Sarah, you will sleep alone tonight.

139
00:19:08,328 --> 00:19:09,838
Yes?

140
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:09,153
My God!

141
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,664
- Excuse me?
- Tell me.

142
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:20,198
Excuse me!

143
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,237
Everyone has gone to the village fair
today, I'd do well to close up myself.

144
00:25:39,902 --> 00:25:43,717
Go and serve the customer.

145
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:47,241
Well?

146
00:25:47,402 --> 00:25:49,490
Has Enrichetta Blonde left already?

147
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:50,957
Who?

148
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:55,613
- Enrichetta Blonde!
-So, that's her name then!

149
00:25:56,146 --> 00:25:59,035
I didn't ask her name.
Did you see her leave?

150
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,489
No. I was still asleep.
The less they work...

151
00:26:02,514 --> 00:26:04,997
Call her and tell her
that her friend Giorgio is here.

152
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,692
You tell her, she was
so anxious to see you!

153
00:26:07,717 --> 00:26:12,382
- Go to hell, you witch!
- Like I don't know you?!

154
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:45,030
She's not there!
She hasn't even packed.

155
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:46,788
When did she leave then?

156
00:26:46,936 --> 00:26:50,212
She must have left during the night.

157
00:26:51,699 --> 00:26:53,104
This way.

158
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,662
Listen...Listen....Wait!

159
00:29:49,897 --> 00:29:53,393
Again? You're the only
person around today.

160
00:29:53,431 --> 00:29:56,130
That door by the side,
is it closed at night?

161
00:29:57,181 --> 00:30:00,607
Why should I close it?
What's it to you?

162
00:30:00,918 --> 00:30:04,857
Don't you realise a woman
has gone missing from your hotel?

163
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:09,270
Like it's the first time a girl
has gone missing around here!

164
00:30:09,295 --> 00:30:10,239
What do you mean?

165
00:30:10,264 --> 00:30:15,429
Another one went missing last month,
and her bag was found in a ditch.

166
00:30:15,518 --> 00:30:19,555
Maybe a truck driver
took her away from here?

167
00:30:19,602 --> 00:30:20,636
No!

168
00:30:25,922 --> 00:30:27,080
Marlboro.

169
00:30:37,734 --> 00:30:38,794
Who is he?

170
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,427
The new porter for the Parissi's.
He is very strange.

171
00:30:42,502 --> 00:30:44,341
And also very curious.

172
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,328
- Can I help you?
-I'd like to speak to Mr. Parissi.

173
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:42,086
- Who should I say is calling?
- Giorgio D'amato, a journalist.

174
00:34:46,678 --> 00:34:49,761
That's Mr. Parissi's wife
and their niece Sarah.

175
00:35:05,284 --> 00:35:08,834
- How did you say you were called?
- Giorgio D'amato, journalist.

176
00:35:19,377 --> 00:35:21,852
- Please, make yourself at home.
-Thanks.

177
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,191
Sir, this is Giorgio D'amato.

178
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:35,980
I don't like journalists,
they irritate me. Please, sit down.

179
00:35:37,808 --> 00:35:43,116
- What paper do you work for?
- I collaborate with various ones.

180
00:35:44,856 --> 00:35:45,983
Tell me...

181
00:35:46,108 --> 00:35:49,431
I haven't come here as a journalist.

182
00:35:49,592 --> 00:35:50,491
Well then?

183
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:53,889
Last night I received
a strange call from Enrichetta Blonde.

184
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,640
I wasn't convinced by her.
She had no personality.

185
00:36:02,787 --> 00:36:04,949
- She's disappeared!
- Another one!

186
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:12,939
Excuse us! I hope we're not
interuppting anything important?

187
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,996
Eleonora, my wife.

188
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:19,965
Sarah, our niece.
This is Giorgio D'amato, a journalist.

189
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:21,191
Pleased to meet you.

190
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,799
Well, let's go dear. Excuse us.

191
00:36:25,824 --> 00:36:29,089
Certainly, Mr Parissi,
surrounded by such beauty...

192
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:33,210
an artist can cultivate
their good taste.

193
00:36:33,951 --> 00:36:36,379
You're too kind.

194
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,095
- Will you stay?
- Stay for dinner with us.

195
00:36:42,189 --> 00:36:44,783
- Thanks, it would be a pleasure.
- See you later, then.

196
00:36:47,723 --> 00:36:48,853
Alberto.

197
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:50,913
You called, Sir.

198
00:36:50,938 --> 00:36:54,405
Yes, Alberto. My friend Mr D'amato
will be dining with us tonight.

199
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:56,131
Very good, Sir.

200
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:03,103
Come, I'll show you some of the most
beautiful photos you've ever seen.

201
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,166
Your work
as a journalist must take you

202
00:37:08,245 --> 00:37:12,056
to some very interesting
places, I imagine?

203
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:15,515
Yes, certainly.
Both surprising and singular.

204
00:37:15,574 --> 00:37:20,679
If I wasn't a medic
I'd have been a journalist.

205
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,919
My poor father wanted me
to be a doctor, so here I am.

206
00:37:24,944 --> 00:37:26,209
Right.

207
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:28,841
- Excuse me, Sir.
- What is it?

208
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:33,021
Lady Sarah asks to be excused for her
lateness. She will be here in a moment.

209
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,375
Thanks.

210
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,689
Tell us about your work.

211
00:37:43,843 --> 00:37:47,738
You seem too young to be a journalist.

212
00:37:48,493 --> 00:37:50,931
Even if he has all the requirements?

213
00:37:52,111 --> 00:37:56,026
What has been your biggest story?

214
00:37:56,189 --> 00:38:00,201
I'm still waiting but I hope
something big comes along soon.

215
00:38:00,476 --> 00:38:02,037
You're ambitious.

216
00:38:02,131 --> 00:38:05,537
Surely ambition is a virtue, not a vice.

217
00:38:05,562 --> 00:38:06,474
Certainly.

218
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:11,365
One should solicit fortune
and exploit good opportunities.

219
00:38:12,328 --> 00:38:16,095
- Right. What do you want in life?
- Everything! Everything it can give me.

220
00:38:16,235 --> 00:38:21,662
Our friend has very clear ideas. This
is what a young man needs to get ahead.

221
00:38:21,711 --> 00:38:24,693
- Sometimes like is unfair.
- No. Life isn't unfair.

222
00:38:24,961 --> 00:38:26,872
There is good and there's bad.

223
00:38:27,012 --> 00:38:28,645
What do you think, Dear?

224
00:38:31,516 --> 00:38:33,240
It depends...

225
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:37,976
What counts in life is having
passion for something.

226
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:41,773
Like I have for my work.

227
00:38:44,708 --> 00:38:47,729
Forgive me,
I really needed a shower.

228
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:52,869
It was so relaxing I forgot
about the dinner and our guests.

229
00:38:53,113 --> 00:38:55,854
But above all, our guest, Sarah.

230
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,028
For a moment
I was envious of the water.

231
00:38:58,067 --> 00:38:59,083
Envious?

232
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,640
Yes, I have
a very impulsive temperament.

233
00:39:07,116 --> 00:39:09,200
Lucia, continue serving.

234
00:39:16,143 --> 00:39:18,320
This wine is very nice.

235
00:39:19,638 --> 00:39:25,596
Ah! Yes, but like women
it can also be our traitor!

236
00:39:30,681 --> 00:39:31,840
Thank you.

237
00:39:37,256 --> 00:39:38,440
That's enough.

238
00:39:43,426 --> 00:39:47,800
You, on the other hand, must be
very lucky with the women? Right?

239
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,852
I don't do too badly.

240
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:55,860
Sometimes I have to hide
from them to escape.

241
00:39:56,379 --> 00:40:00,188
You know what you want, eh?
Bravo! Bravo!

242
00:40:09,395 --> 00:40:10,770
No thanks.

243
00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:13,866
Excuse me, please.
Do you want the bread?

244
00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:15,325
Yes please.

245
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,640
No thanks.

246
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:29,273
Finally, a pretty waitress.
She isn't bad is she?

247
00:40:30,835 --> 00:40:34,885
To tell you the truth, there are three
things that are important to me...

248
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:38,650
Flowers, good wine and women.

249
00:40:39,361 --> 00:40:41,228
Flowers because
they are beautiful,

250
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,736
wine because it brings love
which is something I need!

251
00:40:45,823 --> 00:40:46,862
And women?

252
00:40:46,887 --> 00:40:52,870
Women have all the qualities
of flowers and wine, and they are women!

253
00:41:00,335 --> 00:41:03,280
I was forgetting
the purpose of my visit...

254
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,305
You were forgetting
you were a journalist?

255
00:41:07,544 --> 00:41:09,961
Now you only have one friend...

256
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:15,328
Amongst new friends.

257
00:41:15,368 --> 00:41:19,800
Thank you. It's an honour
to be accepted as your friend.

258
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:40,475
Aren't you hungry, Dear?

259
00:41:41,155 --> 00:41:46,048
To be honest, not really.
But thanks for your consideration.

260
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,704
You're not well Edmund,
you should rest.

261
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:53,158
For our uncle,
his only job is to rest.

262
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:56,517
For me it's quite the opposite.
Resting is my work!

263
00:41:56,675 --> 00:41:58,285
Are you the village doctor?

264
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:02,465
You could say that, but in this
village everyone is quite well...

265
00:42:02,847 --> 00:42:04,161
Except for Edmund.

266
00:42:04,261 --> 00:42:09,058
This is a fixation of yours! Why?
Why do you want me sick?

267
00:42:10,273 --> 00:42:11,703
Sick.

268
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:26,151
I'm well...I'm well.

269
00:42:28,132 --> 00:42:29,800
It's just work.

270
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,640
A work I don't understand.

271
00:42:37,207 --> 00:42:39,810
You've never understood my work.

272
00:42:41,565 --> 00:42:43,240
Not only that.

273
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:48,440
It's a good thing I have Sarah!

274
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,236
My presence is perhaps...?

275
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:55,634
Don't worry about it,
Doctor Dalla is used to this.

276
00:42:58,233 --> 00:42:59,926
Please excuse us,

277
00:43:00,146 --> 00:43:04,750
until now we've been treating
you like one of the family.

278
00:43:06,339 --> 00:43:11,581
Deep down they love each other,
I assure you. I know them both too well.

279
00:43:13,564 --> 00:43:15,123
What do you know about love?

280
00:43:15,273 --> 00:43:17,667
Its like a big splash in serene water...

281
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,360
It hits you when you least expect it.

282
00:43:33,246 --> 00:43:37,793
- Imagine if they both loved each other?
- Doctor Dalla is always joking around!

283
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:41,660
What have I said that's so wrong?
It's perfectly natural, no?

284
00:43:43,635 --> 00:43:46,720
Coffee is ready,
will you please come to the lounge.

285
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,282
Alright.

286
00:43:52,648 --> 00:43:53,772
Please.

287
00:43:55,664 --> 00:43:59,160
My dear, you know how I always
like to joke around.

288
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,061
Apart from being my niece,
Sarah is also my best friend.

289
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:42,764
{\an8}Her father was my brother.

290
00:44:42,842 --> 00:44:45,507
{\an8}He and his wife died
in an aeroplane crash...

291
00:44:45,658 --> 00:44:47,619
{\an8}Since then,
Sarah has been with us.

292
00:44:47,712 --> 00:44:51,000
{\an8}Although we are affectionate
to her, she has always missed them.

293
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,233
{\an8}She's a beautiful woman, so simple.

294
00:44:54,688 --> 00:44:56,741
{\an8}Yes, that's right.
We are very close,

295
00:44:56,859 --> 00:44:59,498
{\an8}she likes to help me,
but this is not enough...

296
00:44:59,744 --> 00:45:02,920
{\an8}I've been trying to convince her
to meet people her own age.

297
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:06,299
{\an8}- More whiskey?
- Yes please.

298
00:45:08,898 --> 00:45:10,799
Let's talk about you Mr. Parissi.

299
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,511
I'd like to know more.

300
00:45:13,785 --> 00:45:17,067
I've heard much about your work
but I know little about you.

301
00:45:17,441 --> 00:45:21,543
- I noticed a collage in the hallway.
- A nude of perfect linear composition.

302
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:25,678
Right, if flesh weren't
imbued in desire

303
00:45:25,709 --> 00:45:28,609
and tinged with pleasure,
it would be a virtue.

304
00:45:29,357 --> 00:45:31,748
Vice, unfortunately,
enters from all angles,

305
00:45:31,866 --> 00:45:35,022
as if carried by the
wind and the air...

306
00:45:35,602 --> 00:45:39,970
To preserve ones virtues
one needs a constant line of defence.

307
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,593
So true!

308
00:45:43,005 --> 00:45:46,900
You aren't usually this quiet, my dear.
What's wrong?

309
00:45:47,236 --> 00:45:52,344
Nothing uncle, the rain
is getting me down. I feel scared.

310
00:45:52,547 --> 00:45:57,525
You should sleep together
tonight, she's just a girl.

311
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:01,222
Doctor, you seem tired.
Please don't stay on our count.

312
00:46:01,308 --> 00:46:03,089
Yes, it's better I get some rest...

313
00:46:03,367 --> 00:46:06,073
Alberto, please take the doctor home.

314
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:10,953
No, there's no need.
My bike is better than any car!

315
00:46:13,467 --> 00:46:15,279
- Will I see you again young man?
- I hope so!

316
00:46:16,354 --> 00:46:20,123
Yes, I believe so.
Trust me, I know these things!

317
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,912
- Goodnight.
- See you tomorrow, Doctor.

318
00:46:22,937 --> 00:46:25,905
- See you around.
- I should also be leaving soon.

319
00:46:26,022 --> 00:46:27,388
Come and visit us again.

320
00:46:27,413 --> 00:46:31,689
We'd be honoured and I'm sure
Sarah would also be happy.

321
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,644
Alberto.

322
00:46:37,084 --> 00:46:39,883
Bring our guests car round to the front.

323
00:46:40,526 --> 00:46:43,594
I wouldn't want Mr. D'amato to get wet.

324
00:46:44,457 --> 00:46:45,508
Yes, Sir.

325
00:46:45,675 --> 00:46:50,301
But dear, isn't rude to send
our guest away in this weather?

326
00:46:50,763 --> 00:46:52,801
Yes, you're right.

327
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:57,035
Alberto...wait.

328
00:46:59,504 --> 00:47:04,280
- Stay here tonight.
- Really, I don't want to impose!

329
00:47:04,305 --> 00:47:07,835
I would be very upset if I learnt
you caught a cold because of us.

330
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,359
Alberto, prepare his room.

331
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,078
Your room, Sir.

332
00:47:40,161 --> 00:47:42,957
That's the maid, she hasn't
finished cleaning the room.

333
00:47:42,982 --> 00:47:44,336
It doesn't matter, goodnight.

334
00:47:44,385 --> 00:47:45,844
Sleep well, Sir.

335
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,960
Aren't you tired, girl?

336
00:48:07,393 --> 00:48:09,350
I need someone!

337
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:16,506
Meet me in my room upstairs.

338
00:48:16,999 --> 00:48:19,640
It's the second door,
near the bathroom.

339
00:48:21,778 --> 00:48:24,728
- It'll be great, you'll see!
- Really!

340
00:48:39,342 --> 00:48:40,542
Let me go.

341
00:50:57,871 --> 00:50:59,051
Lucia!

342
00:51:01,137 --> 00:51:02,223
Lucia!

343
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:06,253
- Is there something you need?
- Excuse me.

344
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,552
Do you suffer from insomnia, Sir?

345
00:52:24,697 --> 00:52:27,034
Right. However, seems like
I'm not the only one...

346
00:52:27,124 --> 00:52:30,690
But I'm doing this for my work.
And you?

347
00:52:31,019 --> 00:52:32,041
I'm thirsty.

348
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:35,339
There's water in your room, Sir.
Goodnight.

349
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:37,019
Goodnight.

350
00:52:48,437 --> 00:52:50,080
You look like a ghost!

351
00:53:00,505 --> 00:53:01,960
Take me away!

352
00:53:06,389 --> 00:53:09,019
- I beg you!
- Why are you so scared?

353
00:53:09,421 --> 00:53:10,933
You've got nothing
to worry about.

354
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:13,996
The people here adore you
and you have everything.

355
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,427
I can't explain, it's difficult.

356
00:53:18,537 --> 00:53:22,568
Sometimes it feels like there's
a chasm opening under my feet.

357
00:53:26,059 --> 00:53:30,563
You must think I'm crazy...
But I'm not!

358
00:53:32,074 --> 00:53:36,157
I don't think so but you must explain
yourself, I need to understand.

359
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:45,066
I really can't explain.

360
00:53:45,678 --> 00:53:49,402
Eleonora makes me do
whatever she says...

361
00:53:49,906 --> 00:53:51,495
What are you saying?

362
00:53:51,864 --> 00:53:53,960
Why don't you tell your uncle?

363
00:53:54,836 --> 00:53:56,952
No! I can't tell him anything.

364
00:53:57,679 --> 00:53:59,499
Like everyone else,
he's at Eleonora's mercy.

365
00:53:59,524 --> 00:54:00,734
But he adores you?

366
00:54:00,966 --> 00:54:04,835
He's so egotistical,
I've always been scared of him.

367
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,120
Since I was a child.

368
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:16,799
You'll help me, right?

369
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:23,794
Of course...Of course!
I'll take you away from here.

370
00:54:37,786 --> 00:54:40,484
And you just sit there! You worm!

371
00:54:42,974 --> 00:54:44,891
You make me mad!

372
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,917
- I'm terrified of what may happen!
- What could happen?

373
00:54:49,479 --> 00:54:51,694
Let me go to the city, I beg you.

374
00:54:51,899 --> 00:54:54,675
You'd have the courage
to leave me alone here?

375
00:54:54,844 --> 00:54:58,560
Forever!
I've had enough.

376
00:55:01,168 --> 00:55:02,998
You said it would be a short stay,

377
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,912
instead we've been here for
2 years, away from the outside world.

378
00:55:09,269 --> 00:55:11,440
I like it here and I'm staying.

379
00:55:12,586 --> 00:55:14,631
I work well here.

380
00:55:16,121 --> 00:55:18,696
You'll be distracted in the city...

381
00:55:19,813 --> 00:55:23,014
Don't forget, this air is good for me.
I'm getting better.

382
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,186
But I'm not a nurse!

383
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:29,624
I'm a woman.

384
00:55:30,626 --> 00:55:31,967
Let's seperate...

385
00:55:36,522 --> 00:55:39,400
- I want to live with you.
- Won't you be scared?

386
00:55:39,743 --> 00:55:44,423
- I'm scared here but not with you.
- What if I'm not who you think?

387
00:55:44,455 --> 00:55:48,306
- You are!
- You'd abandon your uncle?

388
00:55:55,064 --> 00:55:58,371
You haven't understood.
My uncle only scares me!

389
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,859
Why?

390
00:56:02,328 --> 00:56:06,060
He's cruel and he only
cares about his invention.

391
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:07,630
Invention?

392
00:56:08,332 --> 00:56:13,167
Yes, he's managed to perfect a method
of photographing human thoughts!

393
00:56:14,075 --> 00:56:16,617
- He's a genius?
- He's a madman!

394
00:56:17,619 --> 00:56:20,422
- He's impotent.
- What do you know?

395
00:56:20,972 --> 00:56:25,200
No, don't think like that,
he's always respected me.

396
00:56:28,854 --> 00:56:31,432
It's his wife Eleonora who...

397
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:33,057
Continue.

398
00:56:33,317 --> 00:56:36,199
She forces me to do what she wants.

399
00:56:39,952 --> 00:56:43,709
- Now I understand.
- But I don't participate.

400
00:56:43,997 --> 00:56:48,060
I'm forced to do it, out of fear.
I'm scared!

401
00:56:49,182 --> 00:56:52,680
But now that you're here, I can feel...

402
00:57:05,257 --> 00:57:07,938
How can you force me
to live here as your wife?

403
00:57:07,983 --> 00:57:09,293
I'm your husband.

404
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:16,528
Listen, you've destroyed my life and now
your destroying your niece's life too.

405
00:57:19,783 --> 00:57:22,792
You're finished,
at the end of your career.

406
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:24,963
Forced to live 
in that wheelchair...

407
00:57:25,249 --> 00:57:27,267
In your work,
in life, you're finished!

408
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:29,977
This isn't true. It's not true...

409
00:57:33,462 --> 00:57:34,695
You're impotent!

410
00:57:34,844 --> 00:57:38,211
Only a man like you would watch me
sleeping with another man in our bed...

411
00:57:38,807 --> 00:57:40,453
You can go if you want!

412
00:57:40,567 --> 00:57:45,112
Is this what you want?
I'll never let you call me a whore!

413
00:57:45,705 --> 00:57:49,432
I've found a sick, depraved
way of satisfying myself.

414
00:57:51,606 --> 00:57:54,400
Getting your kicks looking
at your niece's body!

415
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:58,052
Damn you! No....

416
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,512
Edmundo!

417
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:08,728
Damn you!...Damn you!

418
00:58:20,328 --> 00:58:24,313
We are... two happy....

419
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:27,767
Two happy people, Edmundo....

420
00:58:37,157 --> 00:58:39,851
- Is it your first time?
- Yes.

421
00:59:11,822 --> 00:59:14,857
The others are all sleeping
and don't want to be disturbed.

422
00:59:15,313 --> 00:59:18,722
If you want to leave,
I'll see you off.

423
00:59:20,363 --> 00:59:21,549
Okay.

424
00:59:26,177 --> 00:59:28,610
- What do you want?
- Am I needed?

425
00:59:28,635 --> 00:59:29,587
- No.
- The gentleman...

426
00:59:29,612 --> 00:59:31,743
We don't need you, go away.

427
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:35,480
You'll pay for this!
I swear, you'll pay!

428
00:59:41,147 --> 00:59:44,160
Are you sure
you don't need anything, Sir?

429
00:59:46,568 --> 00:59:47,754
No.

430
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,440
What are you trying to do?

431
01:00:25,924 --> 01:00:28,280
For once I'd like
to do this my way!

432
01:00:29,986 --> 01:00:32,600
You stay in your place,
it's better for all of us.

433
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:38,120
Do as you want, I'm fed
up keeping an eye on you.

434
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:40,425
Listen to me carefully!

435
01:00:40,886 --> 01:00:42,183
Do you really think that you

436
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:44,602
and those hysterical 
that we serve, may keep me here?

437
01:00:44,716 --> 01:00:49,438
No! I want to live...to live!
Do you understand?

438
01:01:10,509 --> 01:01:12,107
Doctor Dalla!

439
01:01:13,028 --> 01:01:14,389
Coming.

440
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,726
What is it? Is Edmundo sick?

441
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:30,314
No, Doctor.
I'm here for other matters.

442
01:01:30,339 --> 01:01:31,197
What then?

443
01:01:31,222 --> 01:01:34,153
Did you see Eleonora
and a model leave here on Saturday?

444
01:01:34,178 --> 01:01:37,907
I don't think so. However,
on Saturday I was at the villa. Why?

445
01:01:38,464 --> 01:01:41,563
She's vanished.
Do you know anything?

446
01:01:44,778 --> 01:01:48,732
I'm very concerned
about this, let's go inside.

447
01:02:02,022 --> 01:02:06,354
It's been two years.
Since I've known her I've been worried.

448
01:02:06,402 --> 01:02:07,837
And Sarah?

449
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:12,650
Poor girl, she's so
intimidated and scared by her.

450
01:02:12,914 --> 01:02:16,813
But Eleonora could warn
the police or someone?

451
01:02:16,954 --> 01:02:19,977
Pity young man, pity...

452
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:25,255
It's about time we called the police
and informed them of our suspicions...

453
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:30,372
There's something strange Doctor.
Sarah told me a secret only she knew...

454
01:02:30,553 --> 01:02:31,771
What?

455
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,430
Edmundo has perfected a way
of photographing the human mind.

456
01:02:39,247 --> 01:02:43,162
Yesterday evening, during the meal,
he was photographing our thoughts.

457
01:02:43,979 --> 01:02:45,400
Mine too?

458
01:02:46,856 --> 01:02:48,223
I think so.

459
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:52,559
He's a madman...a madman!

460
01:02:54,393 --> 01:02:55,848
- Hello?
- Hello?

461
01:02:56,364 --> 01:02:59,160
Are you Doctor Dalla?
It's me, Eleonora...

462
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:03,968
- Good Morning, madam.
- I feel scared and frightened...

463
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:06,491
What's wrong?

464
01:03:07,257 --> 01:03:08,960
Sarah disappeared this morning.

465
01:03:09,033 --> 01:03:14,262
She told Alberto she was going
to the city to see her grandparents.

466
01:03:14,505 --> 01:03:17,044
It's a little out of
character but don't worry,

467
01:03:17,194 --> 01:03:20,294
we'll try and do something.
Stay calm.

468
01:03:20,649 --> 01:03:24,190
But Doctor, I am calling you
from her grandparents home!

469
01:03:24,396 --> 01:03:27,994
Here, in Rome.
I came immediately.

470
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:29,247
In Rome?

471
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:32,620
She hasn't been here.
Not only that, they haven't seen her...

472
01:03:32,649 --> 01:03:34,533
and she hasn't even called.

473
01:03:34,558 --> 01:03:39,581
I'm so desperate! Who knows what could
have happened to the poor girl?

474
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:45,122
- Stay calm, Madam.
- What's happened?...Sarah?

475
01:03:46,083 --> 01:03:48,184
- Madam?
- Please help me!

476
01:03:48,412 --> 01:03:52,394
Listen, stay where you are.
I'm sending Mr. D'amato to you.

477
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:56,621
In the meanwhile I'll head over
to the villa, please wait!

478
01:03:57,108 --> 01:03:59,434
You must go immediately
to the city, Via Clemente 87.

479
01:03:59,517 --> 01:04:02,263
You must hurry,
Eleonora is waiting there for you.

480
01:04:02,762 --> 01:04:04,320
I'll come straight away.

481
01:04:10,887 --> 01:04:13,788
Alberto...Alberto!

482
01:04:19,596 --> 01:04:21,088
Alberto!

483
01:04:22,408 --> 01:04:27,095
Alberto!

484
01:04:28,846 --> 01:04:30,565
Alberto!

485
01:04:44,606 --> 01:04:45,736
What do you want?

486
01:04:46,105 --> 01:04:48,767
Go away... Go away!

487
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,612
Go away.
Dirty beast!

488
01:06:05,686 --> 01:06:07,105
Go away!

489
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,480
Certainly, it was
what she believed in.

490
01:06:56,744 --> 01:07:00,793
Erotomania
in a hypermanical state...

491
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:04,156
Erotomania!

492
01:07:04,181 --> 01:07:07,566
Yes, the morbid desires
of her sexual instincts.

493
01:07:08,074 --> 01:07:12,647
- Paranoia, Schizophrenia...
-Then it's dangerous!?

494
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:19,632
It depends on her state of arousal,
the stimulants that provoke her...

495
01:07:20,033 --> 01:07:23,840
But, I'll be more precise,
I've got all the details here.

496
01:07:25,255 --> 01:07:26,255
Here...

497
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,403
The doctors in the
neuropsychology clinic

498
01:07:28,428 --> 01:07:31,013
where she was recovering
ten years ago,

499
01:07:31,373 --> 01:07:34,809
agreed after some deliberation,

500
01:07:34,903 --> 01:07:38,000
that her state of equilibrium
didn't respond to a latent state.

501
01:07:38,576 --> 01:07:42,504
I understand.
My suspicions were correct.

502
01:07:45,864 --> 01:07:48,538
Is this the first time you've
left there by yourself?

503
01:07:48,571 --> 01:07:49,750
Yes, of course.

504
01:07:50,784 --> 01:07:53,773
{\an5}We always went out together.

505
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:23,480
- Let's hope Sarah meets us soon.
- Yes, she'll arrive on time.

506
01:12:14,377 --> 01:12:19,063
So, this morning,
she preferred to go to the police.

507
01:12:19,243 --> 01:12:22,861
If what Sarah said is true, this
will be the big story of my career!

508
01:14:08,108 --> 01:14:09,320
My God.

509
01:14:11,341 --> 01:14:12,696
It's him!

510
01:14:21,047 --> 01:14:22,378
Alberto!

511
01:14:31,683 --> 01:14:36,569
Alberto!

512
01:15:23,444 --> 01:15:26,964
- Wasn't that Alberto's car?
- It looked like it.

513
01:15:29,868 --> 01:15:32,010
Quick, let's catch up with him.

514
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,513
Alberto... Alberto!

515
01:15:40,902 --> 01:15:43,068
What have you done to her?

516
01:15:43,836 --> 01:15:47,193
You're a crazy murderer!

517
01:15:47,986 --> 01:15:49,532
Why?

518
01:15:49,822 --> 01:15:51,777
Why kill?

519
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:55,454
Why carve up the bodies
of these beautiful woman?

520
01:15:56,355 --> 01:15:59,727
Only to bury them
beneath the lettuce!

521
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,365
You've discovered a method of
photographing other people's thoughts...

522
01:16:25,841 --> 01:16:27,733
What about you?

523
01:16:29,187 --> 01:16:31,227
You could have saved
yourself the pain

524
01:16:31,252 --> 01:16:33,447
of discovering that
you are the assassin!

525
01:16:34,777 --> 01:16:38,095
Now you'll even kill this poor woman!

526
01:16:39,858 --> 01:16:41,288
Confess your crimes!

527
01:16:41,374 --> 01:16:43,629
You know very well
that you killed her!

528
01:16:43,654 --> 01:16:45,069
No! It's not true.

529
01:16:45,108 --> 01:16:50,328
You'd be happy to see me
fall, but I'm somebody!

530
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:54,043
Anna, Anna! You killed her!

531
01:16:54,706 --> 01:16:58,453
Even this poor woman.
Damned murderer!

532
01:16:58,941 --> 01:17:01,977
Alberto... Alberto!

533
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:08,715
He killed this woman as well!

534
01:17:10,272 --> 01:17:13,173
Damned murderer!

535
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:57,093
This was in Doctor Dalla's thoughts.

536
01:17:59,186 --> 01:18:04,210
No...'Stefanelli'.
Yes... 'Professor Stefanelli'

537
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:06,710
He was an illustrious surgeon...

538
01:18:07,069 --> 01:18:08,926
who killed his wife, Anna,

539
01:18:09,075 --> 01:18:12,503
in a schizophrenic attack
during an operation.

540
01:18:12,727 --> 01:18:15,965
which she was undergoing
to resolve a difficult birth.

541
01:18:17,062 --> 01:18:19,013
Then he changed his name

542
01:18:19,599 --> 01:18:24,775
and convinced his friends to get him the
post of medical officer in the village.

543
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:26,798
He bought some property,

544
01:18:28,243 --> 01:18:29,978
and lived reasonably well.

545
01:18:30,346 --> 01:18:32,473
Are you the butler from the villa?

546
01:18:34,421 --> 01:18:36,262
Alberto Garcia...

547
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:39,770
Private Investigator.

548
01:18:42,493 --> 01:18:43,926
Does he work for you?

549
01:18:43,974 --> 01:18:47,583
Yes, as a butler.
I had no idea he was...

550
01:18:47,608 --> 01:18:51,045
I've been following the case of the
missing photomodels for some time...

551
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:53,365
and seeing how the police
were blundering in the dark,

552
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:57,632
if you'll forgive me Commissioner,
I decided to start my own investigation.

553
01:18:58,055 --> 01:19:00,545
My agency has been
open for many years...

554
01:19:00,826 --> 01:19:03,053
but without much success.

555
01:19:03,373 --> 01:19:07,400
I was thinking this could
be my lucky break...

556
01:19:07,977 --> 01:19:11,880
The chambermaid,
was she also your agent?

557
01:19:14,778 --> 01:19:16,705
She was my sister.

558
01:19:19,363 --> 01:19:21,066
Poor Lucia...

559
01:19:26,278 --> 01:19:29,605
Now, Commissioner,
if you'll come with me,

560
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:34,240
I want to demonstrate
this technique I have perfected.

561
01:19:37,388 --> 01:19:39,701
What will you do with your machine?

562
01:19:42,872 --> 01:19:46,735
I don't know.
I haven't decided yet, but...

563
01:19:48,376 --> 01:19:52,501
I think... I'll give it to science.

564
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:55,564
A discovery like this must...

565
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,584
Yes! It must be used
to serve society,

566
01:20:01,101 --> 01:20:04,100
but in a society run by men
of a superior intelligence!
