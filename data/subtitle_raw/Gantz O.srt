1
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,736
--casualties have been medevacked.

2
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,472
Live from Shibuya.

3
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:42,776
I can see many cars ablaze
at Shibuya Crossing.

4
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,646
The destruction is like a war zone.

5
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,817
--the area is closed off.
The cause remains unknown.

6
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:28,782
Kurono!

7
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:32,319
Your suit!

8
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:47,634
Don't.

9
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,736
Someone has to.

10
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,171
But you can't!

11
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,474
I have to!

12
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,610
Who else will?

13
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,716
Kurono!

14
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:35,449
Kurono.

15
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,885
How's Pop?

16
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,326
He's alive!

17
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,331
Good...

18
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,341
Kurono? Please...

19
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,878
Kurono! Kurono!

20
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,952
No! I don't want to go!

21
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,820
Kurono!

22
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,653
See my shiny and wavy hair.

23
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,823
Enrich your hair.

24
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,393
NEWSFLASH
OSAKA IS IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY

25
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,529
What's going on in Osaka?

26
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:59,332
Maybe it's monsters, like in Shibuya?

27
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,437
-OSAKA'S IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY.
-YOU OKAY?

28
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,706
LIKE THE KILLINGS IN TOKYO.

29
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,978
It contains super rich
hyaluronic acid, Akatsuki.

30
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,914
-IS IT THE U.S. MILITARY?
-IT'S MASSACRE!

31
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,762
Ayumu, I'm in Shinjuku.
I'll catch a train.

32
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,433
You're late. What have you been doing?

33
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:34,935
I'm sorry.

34
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:39,506
Do you remember what today is?

35
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:44,544
What is it?

36
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,058
He has a knife!

37
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:01,494
Police!

38
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,367
There!

39
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:16,776
Where are you hurt?

40
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,646
You'll be okay.

41
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,175
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, AYUMU

42
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,200
Am I alive?

43
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,013
Hey, you--

44
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,085
Are you in shock?

45
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:35,755
I got...

46
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:37,891
stabbed.

47
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,026
You were?

48
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,600
I dropped dead from a stroke.

49
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,705
Reika here was in a car accident.

50
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,076
Reika...

51
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,111
The star?

52
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,681
Oh, yeah. She's a big deal, right?

53
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:05,552
I'm a bit out of touch,

54
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,588
but I saw her in a TV ad.

55
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,091
What was it? Shampoo...

56
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,259
Oh, please. Who cares?

57
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,032
Aren't you her fan, Nishi?

58
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,101
I know you schoolboys...

59
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,669
Shut up, Baldy.

60
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,709
What's your name?

61
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,081
Masaru Kato.

62
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:39,052
My name is Suzuki.

63
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,554
Nice to meet you.

64
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,289
What's going on?

65
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,592
Explain!

66
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,230
It's hard to believe,

67
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,768
but we all died before.

68
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,536
What...?

69
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,638
You told me the same thing.

70
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,574
It makes no sense to me!

71
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:06,246
Rise and shine
It's a new morning for us

72
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:10,216
A morning of new hope

73
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:14,587
Breathe in
A chest full of joy

74
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,558
Look up at the clear, blue sky!

75
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,994
Listen to the radio

76
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,562
What's this?

77
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:26,800
The summer breeze
It is so wholesome

78
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,937
Breathe in and exercise now

79
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:34,240
To the count of one, two and three

80
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,647
Your old lives have ended.

81
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,956
I will decide how to use your new lives.
That's the way the cookie crumbles.

82
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:56,129
Go now and finish off this guy.

83
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,698
Nurarihyon.

84
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:04,370
HE KICKS ASS. HE WON'T GIVE UP.
KILL HIM IN GIVEN TIME.

85
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:07,941
Oh, no. He looks tough!

86
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,710
What is this thing?

87
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,914
This black orb is... Gantz.

88
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,050
Gantz?

89
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,821
I don't know why,
but that's what everyone calls it.

90
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,894
What the hell?

91
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,030
Are these toy guns?

92
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,335
"Kato-cha, LOL." Is this mine?

93
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:42,075
You two first-timers
had better get dressed now.

94
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:46,212
Don't tell me what to do, Baldy!

95
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:58,758
Morons like him always die first.

96
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,795
What's that, punk?

97
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,365
You're just a stupid gamer.

98
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,769
You have an attitude, school kid.

99
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,441
I'm talking to you, punk!

100
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,977
-Nishi!
-Don't!

101
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:33,993
I told you.

102
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,994
Nishi!

103
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,964
He would have only dragged us down.

104
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,105
This guy looks useless, too.

105
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,307
Are you okay?

106
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,076
Put on the gear, Kato!

107
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,211
Who are you?

108
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:58,484
We're stuck playing
an endless survival game.

109
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,920
A survival game?

110
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:04,357
You must have seen it on the news.

111
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,827
You know the monster in Shibuya...?

112
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,363
We fight the monsters.

113
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:15,768
You mean,
you're the ones in the black suits?

114
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,471
In the previous game,

115
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:24,043
our toughest members
were eliminated unfortunately.

116
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,913
We lost our leader.

117
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,918
Gantz, beam me out of here.

118
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,790
Hurry up, Kato!

119
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,133
Quickly, please!

120
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,875
Put it on!

121
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,226
Are you okay?

122
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,168
Wait a minute...

123
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,136
DOTONBORI

124
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,104
We're...

125
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:01,107
This is Osaka!

126
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:06,012
But we're always sent to Tokyo!

127
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,455
She's out of range, moron.

128
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,180
Are you okay?

129
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:17,583
You guys are useless.

130
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,555
Sorry, I totally panicked.

131
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,590
What's going on?

132
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,360
Explain it to me.

133
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,694
Fuck off.

134
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,497
What's going on? What is she?

135
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,200
-Why us?
-Wait, Nishi!

136
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,435
I'll tell him.

137
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,413
Why do we have to fight them?

138
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,649
And who are they?

139
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,185
We don't know.

140
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,954
We only know one thing.

141
00:15:55,254 --> 00:16:00,159
We have to kill all the enemies
before our time runs out.

142
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,463
What if we don't?

143
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:06,432
Then...

144
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,538
We'd all die.

145
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:13,739
But...

146
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,409
For real.

147
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,113
We'd no longer exist in the world.

148
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,417
That's the Gantz rules.

149
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,587
What do you mean, rules?

150
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:31,991
Oh, no!

151
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,560
Impossible!

152
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,482
Come here.

153
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,419
This way.

154
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,667
Kato, go ahead and shoot!

155
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,380
Kato!

156
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:49,795
I'm okay?

157
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,266
The suit protected you. Come on!

158
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,677
Who did it?

159
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,749
-He's lying!
-Are you?

160
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,403
Who are they?

161
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:34,373
You have a Tokyo accent.

162
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:37,643
Are you the Osaka team?

163
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,245
Osaka team?

164
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,480
So, there are more?

165
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,683
How come you don't know that?

166
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,887
This is his first game.

167
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:54,560
A novice, a kid, a middle-aged man,
and a woman.

168
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,562
How pathetic.

169
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,236
Ouch!

170
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,439
Is he okay?

171
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:10,910
As long as you're still alive,
you'll get back all your limbs

172
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,513
when the stage is cleared.

173
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,248
What...?

174
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:20,619
How about that tough guy
who's called Kuro or something?

175
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:21,987
He's dead.

176
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,825
Wait a minute!

177
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:27,860
It's Reika!

178
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:30,963
Man! Look at the jugs on her!

179
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:31,931
Shit!

180
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,671
Hey, the Tokyo team's not bad.

181
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,875
More of them!

182
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,610
Here we go!

183
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,855
You just sit and watch, wimps.

184
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:06,332
Reika, watch us finish them off.

185
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,801
Then we can swap numbers.

186
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,670
Come on, George!

187
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,643
There are so many of them!

188
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,412
I'll go for the right side.

189
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:22,414
How about you?

190
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,381
They're enjoying this...

191
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:43,462
That's worth points. I'll have it.

192
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:15,928
How about that, Reika?

193
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,636
The Osaka team is tough.

194
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:27,473
What's that weapon and the bike thing?

195
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:35,047
You can get superior weapons
if you score 100 points.

196
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,782
One hundred points...?

197
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:39,552
After defeating the enemies,

198
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:44,056
we're teleported back to the room
to get scored.

199
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,759
100-POINT MENU

200
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:49,461
If you get 100, you win the game.

201
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:57,002
Gantz gives you three bonus options.

202
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,537
Like what?

203
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,207
Like superior weapons.

204
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,444
Or resurrect a dead teammate.

205
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,913
You can bring them back?

206
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,583
Apparently. I've never done it.

207
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,851
And the third option?

208
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:14,787
3. HAVE YOUR MEMORY WIPED AND QUIT.

209
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:15,854
Graduation.

210
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,590
You'll be free!

211
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:19,692
Free?

212
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:24,129
Score 100 points
and you can leave this all behind.

213
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:29,668
You'll forget all about the Gantz games
and go back to your regular life.

214
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:34,006
Anyway, it's good, isn't it?

215
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,576
We won't have to do anything.

216
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:41,046
The Osaka guys will wipe out the monsters.

217
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:46,952
I'll let them have the small ones,
and I'll take the Boss at the end.

218
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:55,828
Nishi's strategy is to hide and wait
for the strongest one at the end.

219
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:59,832
Killing the Boss scores you
a lot of points.

220
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:01,900
Help!

221
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,745
We have to help those people.

222
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,713
Come on, Suzuki.

223
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,784
We should avoid any unnecessary risks.

224
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:19,818
Suzuki!

225
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,822
-But isn't that what you do?
-Well...

226
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,691
Not without our leader...

227
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,059
Come on!

228
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:33,565
We're not tough enough
to protect other people.

229
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,017
We can leave it to the Osaka team...

230
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:56,889
so that we can just concentrate
on surviving, okay?

231
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:01,059
Kato, wait! Kato!

232
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:09,068
If you must go, keep this.

233
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,773
Someone's waiting for your call.

234
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,844
There are still some pay phones around.

235
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:27,986
Make sure that you don't die.

236
00:26:58,784 --> 00:26:59,985
It's good.

237
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,655
All the sauce we want!

238
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,701
Do you see that there?

239
00:27:19,705 --> 00:27:20,772
Yeah...

240
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,109
It's no Biriken statue.

241
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,819
He's spooky.

242
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,167
The Kato residence.

243
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:52,704
Hello?

244
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,875
Ayumu, it's me.

245
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:01,313
Where have you been?
I've been calling you.

246
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,348
Sorry.

247
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,251
I was called into work.

248
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,288
On a night like this?

249
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:12,257
With what's happening in Osaka?

250
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,796
What's happening there?

251
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,700
Some monsters are running wild in Osaka.

252
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:24,703
Really?

253
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:27,105
I had no idea.

254
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:32,044
How is that even possible?
Anyway, just come home.

255
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:34,746
Sorry.

256
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,282
It'll be a while.

257
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:42,120
Okay, see you later.

258
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:43,121
Ayumu.

259
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:45,791
What?

260
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,896
I will come home.

261
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:56,101
I know that!
I'll eat first, then go to bed.

262
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:15,287
It's here!

263
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:30,402
Damn it!

264
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,075
Hi there!

265
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,281
You with the Tokyo team?

266
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,217
Right.

267
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:57,022
I'm Anzu Yamasaki,
from the Osaka team. And you?

268
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,159
I'm Masaru Kato.

269
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:05,097
How old are you? I'm 23.

270
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,332
Seventeen.

271
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:11,370
A high-school boy! You're just a kid.

272
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,075
I've been watching you.

273
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,346
I got really curious about...

274
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,149
what you were doing.

275
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:28,553
I'm sure I'm wrong, but...

276
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:32,524
Did you just save that family?

277
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,028
What were you really doing?

278
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:38,930
Well...

279
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,633
I saved the family.

280
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,070
Oh, my God, it's impossible!

281
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:46,104
I did.

282
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,306
No! No one does that.

283
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:49,975
But I did!

284
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:54,379
Would you just watch someone get killed?

285
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:58,550
Phony Alien!

286
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:05,657
Are you upset?

287
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,692
I'll help people.

288
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,162
Quit it.

289
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,697
You hypocrite.

290
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:15,167
Don't follow me.

291
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:20,272
Lighten up. I love watching weirdos.

292
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,609
You're funny.

293
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:29,614
I know you won't last long.

294
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,586
I just remembered.

295
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:39,124
I saw a kid hiding with some old people.

296
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,593
I hope they're okay.

297
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,261
Where are they?

298
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,165
You're such a show-off!

299
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:55,040
Don't cry or the monsters will get us.

300
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:58,476
We're finished. It's just like hell.

301
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,446
It's okay if I die...

302
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:04,549
but not the boy.

303
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:07,419
His life's just begun.

304
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,088
I want to take him to his parents.

305
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:15,760
Get away from it!

306
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:19,231
You run! I'll take care of it!

307
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,565
Honey!

308
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,611
Honey!

309
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,450
Honey!

310
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,058
There they are.

311
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,029
Are you okay? I'll save you!

312
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:53,064
Back away!

313
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:57,669
Run!

314
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,205
No. I'll save them!

315
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:03,208
No way. You can't beat him!

316
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,346
I'll save them.

317
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,515
Don't you dare!

318
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,752
I know you're scared.

319
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,823
You'll die, you blockhead!

320
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:24,296
Stop! He'll seriously kill you!

321
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:25,730
You idiot!

322
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:32,437
He can die if he wants to.

323
00:34:32,504 --> 00:34:35,607
He's just a hopeless moron...

324
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:41,079
He is kind of cute though.

325
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:45,550
Is there anything I can do, boy?

326
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,252
Just move away.

327
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:50,221
Idiots like that are rare.

328
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:53,191
One of a kind...

329
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,401
Get back!

330
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:06,671
What's this?

331
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:12,711
Maybe I'm scared...

332
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:16,781
...to see him die.

333
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:39,771
How can I beat him?

334
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:45,644
What an idiot!

335
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:57,555
Damn it!

336
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:31,556
Excuse me!

337
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,230
Now what?

338
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:42,627
Hey!

339
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:48,466
Are you okay?

340
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,005
Hey, are you okay?

341
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:15,693
Is there a doctor or a paramedic?

342
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:20,398
Someone call an ambulance!

343
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:26,504
Major roads are swarming with citizens.

344
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:31,810
Experts say that the creatures
are not of this Earth

345
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,379
but of alien origin.

346
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,714
You're gonna save more people?

347
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:41,519
Yeah.

348
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:47,592
Why are you acting like such a hero?

349
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:50,428
Leave it alone.

350
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:56,601
I'm just curious about your upbringing.

351
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:01,539
What do your parents do?

352
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,075
My parents?

353
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,979
Dad was a firefighter.

354
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,549
He died with Mom in a car accident.

355
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,986
When I was in junior high.

356
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,624
Any siblings?

357
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,360
A brother, 10.

358
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:25,063
Is he in an orphanage?

359
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,500
I work so we can live in an apartment.

360
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:35,440
If you don't survive,
your brother would be left alone.

361
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:37,809
Right.

362
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,979
I live with my 3-year-old son.

363
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,515
You're a mom?

364
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,019
Yeah. Do I look too young?

365
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:55,560
Hey! Just say "yes"
whenever you're asked that.

366
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:04,802
Anyway, we're both in a similar situation.

367
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,573
We can't afford to die.

368
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,174
Never.

369
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:13,912
Right.

370
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,814
We can't die.

371
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:24,722
Military personnel have been deployed

372
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,525
all across the city.

373
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,131
We have an update on the mysterious people
in black suits.

374
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:37,702
This footage was just uploaded
to a video site.

375
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:44,042
A young man in black fought
to protect an old couple and a child.

376
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,449
THEY EXIST!

377
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:53,685
-I'M IMPRESSED.
-GO, OSAKA!

378
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,087
-SEE THE NEWS?
-IS IT REAL?

379
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:58,856
-THE TV SAYS SO.
-GO, BLACK SUIT!

380
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:07,698
Go now!

381
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:08,967
Thank you.

382
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,913
-Use the big gun!
-Not yet!

383
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,648
I'll do it.

384
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:27,852
There's something crazy about them...

385
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,792
Guys like them always survive.

386
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,829
That dark-skinned one...

387
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:39,998
We call him George.

388
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,967
His real name is Shimaki.

389
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,236
He's won three bonuses.

390
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,841
The tall skinhead is Nobuo Muroya.

391
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,543
We call him Nobuyan.

392
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:54,779
He's won four times.

393
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,849
He's a megalomaniac.

394
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,550
And he's a reckless...

395
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,587
self-appointed leader.

396
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:04,155
But...

397
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,991
there's one more.

398
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:09,594
Really?

399
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:14,565
Hachiro Oka, a seven-time bonus winner.

400
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,702
He's somewhere.

401
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,739
He cloaks himself and goes into hiding.

402
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:35,620
Good...

403
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:51,202
I hope Kato is doing okay.

404
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:56,641
What's wrong?

405
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,711
If Kurono was alive,

406
00:43:01,212 --> 00:43:05,049
would he have saved people like Kato?

407
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,620
I'm sure he would have.

408
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:14,892
We can resurrect Kurono if we score 100.

409
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,063
We don't have a chance.

410
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:21,833
But, Suzuki...

411
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:25,870
We can hardly take care of ourselves.

412
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,175
Oh, no!

413
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,665
There's one in Japan?

414
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,038
Is it on our side?

415
00:44:59,931 --> 00:45:02,867
The Boss creature should be 100 points.

416
00:45:03,401 --> 00:45:06,437
One hundred points for one creature?

417
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,806
Yeah, 100 for one.

418
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:13,978
The monsters on the tower look badass.

419
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,915
Killing one won't get 100 points.

420
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:21,419
Oka says it's happened before.

421
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:22,753
Really?

422
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:27,725
It was before our time.
Before we went to the room.

423
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:31,128
Everyone died except Oka.

424
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:34,031
Oka killed the Boss monster.

425
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:35,733
By himself!

426
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,803
He's a monster himself!

427
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,488
Oh, God.

428
00:45:58,756 --> 00:45:59,857
What's that?

429
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:04,095
It's way out of our league.

430
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,397
Freeze! Put your hands up!

431
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:09,800
Wait!

432
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:12,270
Don't shoot!

433
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,974
Kato!

434
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:18,309
Don't shoot!

435
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:22,213
You in the black suits! Who are you with?

436
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:24,115
-I'll shoot!
-Wait!

437
00:46:25,016 --> 00:46:28,853
-We're agents.
-State your unit.

438
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,421
Our unit is...

439
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:32,156
Gantz.

440
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:34,992
Gantz?

441
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,431
He's in even more trouble!

442
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,967
-Show your ID!
-We don't have any.

443
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,535
But it's true!

444
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:46,070
-I'll shoot!
-No!

445
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:47,572
Wait a minute.

446
00:47:08,893 --> 00:47:10,127
Fire!

447
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:16,167
Run, all of you!

448
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,118
Watch Suzuki!

449
00:47:58,075 --> 00:47:59,276
Come and get me!

450
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,620
No way.

451
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:04,575
Well?

452
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:08,212
Hey.

453
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,215
You're shitting me.

454
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:19,056
It's not dead.

455
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:21,559
Is it a 100?

456
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,728
I'll do him.

457
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:31,669
You'll be flatter than paper
when I'm through.

458
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:48,052
Pretty tough, aren't you?

459
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:49,420
You cockroach.

460
00:50:14,278 --> 00:50:15,713
Stop playing!

461
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,317
You fuck!

462
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:33,364
You goddamn motherfucker!

463
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,334
Fucking help!

464
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:41,605
Boo-hoo, can't you take care of yourself?

465
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:02,760
I bet you shit your pants, Muroya.

466
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:15,673
Fuck...

467
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,543
He's dead.

468
00:51:20,778 --> 00:51:21,745
No way!

469
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,829
So, you're their boss?

470
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:41,398
That old man?

471
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,809
Gotcha!

472
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:11,595
What the...?

473
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,365
What is this?

474
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:18,335
What is it?

475
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,215
I've caught you!

476
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:30,607
This can't be true!

477
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:32,876
They're both dead!

478
00:53:37,481 --> 00:53:38,682
What's your plan?

479
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:43,554
I'll do whatever I can.

480
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:45,589
You'll die!

481
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:47,891
Think of your brother!

482
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,594
That's why it has to be done.

483
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:53,630
Otherwise...

484
00:53:54,498 --> 00:53:55,933
we'll all die.

485
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:00,470
But how?

486
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:04,775
Hey! Hey! Don't be stupid!

487
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:42,813
She just dodges it!

488
00:54:53,524 --> 00:54:54,925
She's too quick.

489
00:54:56,693 --> 00:54:57,861
All together!

490
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:23,654
She was hit.

491
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,702
A hit to the head has no effect!

492
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:43,974
Cover me.

493
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:52,716
Ayumu, I promise you.

494
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:55,853
I'll come home!

495
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:49,439
I got the Boss!

496
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:05,689
You almost blew us all up!

497
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:10,527
Big deal! I went for his arm anyway.

498
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:16,667
We made it...

499
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,437
We beat the Osaka team.

500
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:41,992
No...

501
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,995
What the heck?

502
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:50,634
Oh, God!

503
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:12,689
Run.

504
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,162
Run!

505
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:17,247
We lost...

506
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:19,115
Look at its head.

507
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:31,161
-It's Oka.
-Oka?

508
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:33,163
Hachiro Oka!

509
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:48,912
He got it!

510
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:05,028
Still bleeding.

511
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:08,865
Hey, can you hear me?

512
01:01:11,268 --> 01:01:13,737
Kato, look at that!

513
01:01:17,107 --> 01:01:18,208
It's alive.

514
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,910
Shit!

515
01:01:24,714 --> 01:01:25,682
Oka...

516
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:32,222
So, if you live to the end of the game,
you'll recover?

517
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:34,257
Well, yes...

518
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,861
If Oka beats him quickly,

519
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:40,397
it will help.

520
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:55,078
It's too powerful!

521
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,415
I don't even know how it attacked me.

522
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:02,185
Oka can do it.

523
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,921
He'll beat it!

524
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:07,457
He's won seven times.

525
01:02:08,125 --> 01:02:09,359
Hachiro Oka.

526
01:02:28,445 --> 01:02:33,416
You're deluded
if you think you can beat me, sucker!

527
01:02:43,026 --> 01:02:46,530
What you don't know is,
I played Ping-Pong in college!

528
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:57,073
I also took karate lessons...

529
01:02:57,974 --> 01:02:59,943
by correspondence!

530
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,267
Amazing.

531
01:03:25,402 --> 01:03:27,103
Did he win...?

532
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,073
You want to die?

533
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:35,045
It's not over. Can't you see?

534
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:47,357
I find this fascinating.

535
01:03:48,425 --> 01:03:50,527
Very fascinating.

536
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:03,606
I think I got it.

537
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:17,287
I've got it. Here I go!

538
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:41,911
He'll lose...

539
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:44,881
Come on, boy!

540
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:04,968
Oka, no!

541
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:30,193
Eat this!

542
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:50,013
Only intuitive attacks work on him.

543
01:05:58,388 --> 01:06:00,723
Is it over? Did he die?

544
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:02,625
Not yet.

545
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:05,361
-No?
-What do you mean?

546
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:09,165
Only surprise attacks work. I'll go cloak.

547
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:12,135
You should finish him off now!

548
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:14,738
No, it's risky.

549
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:21,311
Damn it...

550
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:29,719
It is risky.

551
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,155
I know.

552
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:34,190
But...

553
01:06:35,525 --> 01:06:37,160
someone's got to do it.

554
01:06:39,529 --> 01:06:40,563
Kato!

555
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:13,530
Kato!

556
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:23,540
Suzuki! Why did you...?

557
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:26,609
Your brother...

558
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:30,246
He's waiting for you.

559
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:35,818
Suzuki! Suzuki!

560
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,181
Reika.

561
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:08,218
Watch Suzuki.

562
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:10,486
But it's...

563
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:12,155
too late.

564
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:15,625
We can save him.

565
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,166
What about you?

566
01:08:23,733 --> 01:08:24,834
I'll do it.

567
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:28,738
I'll finish the game.

568
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:32,642
-Kato!
-Don't!

569
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:41,851
Where's that other guy?

570
01:08:42,652 --> 01:08:44,621
He was fun to play with.

571
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:18,221
Stay here. I'll kill you later.

572
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,795
Hey, are you okay?

573
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:32,869
-What now?
-We can run and leave it to Oka!

574
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:34,804
And if he loses?

575
01:09:34,871 --> 01:09:36,506
But...

576
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:39,742
We have to think of a way to win!

577
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:41,844
It's impossible.

578
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:46,449
We can't die.
We both have someone waiting for us.

579
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:52,622
That's why I'm going.

580
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:56,359
I have to!

581
01:09:57,894 --> 01:10:00,863
I have to! Who else will?

582
01:10:03,266 --> 01:10:04,567
You're right.

583
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:07,336
We have to.

584
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:09,238
Reika.

585
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:11,774
How can we beat that thing?

586
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:16,913
Oka said it must be a surprise attack.

587
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:19,649
How do we surprise him?

588
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:21,951
Maybe we can snipe him.

589
01:10:26,456 --> 01:10:27,557
Good idea.

590
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:32,929
I'll be a decoy. When he approaches,
shoot him from a distance.

591
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:35,665
Are you out of your mind?!

592
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:41,871
We have no choice.

593
01:10:45,675 --> 01:10:49,278
Are you sure we want to snipe him?

594
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,547
Ayumu.

595
01:11:30,987 --> 01:11:31,988
What's wrong?

596
01:11:34,924 --> 01:11:36,359
Listen.

597
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:40,396
I have to say this before I go.

598
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:43,699
You...

599
01:11:45,435 --> 01:11:48,471
You mean a lot to me.

600
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:55,078
Please don't die.

601
01:11:57,513 --> 01:11:59,382
Do not die, okay?

602
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,553
I don't intend to.

603
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,625
You mean it?

604
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:11,494
You really mean it?

605
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:13,596
Yes.

606
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:19,635
I won't give up,
even if the odds are against me.

607
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:26,842
Promise me.

608
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:31,547
If you survive,
the four of us can live together.

609
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:35,885
You, your brother, me, and my boy.

610
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:41,023
All right? Make a promise.

611
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:48,097
Come on!

612
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:53,369
Just say "yes" when you're asked that.

613
01:12:58,875 --> 01:12:59,909
Yes.

614
01:13:02,645 --> 01:13:03,879
It's a promise.

615
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:07,983
Don't break it!

616
01:13:14,023 --> 01:13:15,124
I'll protect you.

617
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:17,960
I won't let you die!

618
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:22,965
Watch me get a bull's-eye on that thing!

619
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:34,510
I will make it home.

620
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:39,115
For sure.

621
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:48,124
What the...?

622
01:14:23,726 --> 01:14:26,496
They're not in position yet...

623
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:40,643
Wait.

624
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:45,481
Let me ask you.

625
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:49,519
Why are we...

626
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,221
killing each other?

627
01:14:54,791 --> 01:14:58,728
Do you feel that you're in God's presence?

628
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:00,563
God?

629
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:05,868
God is the absolute power.

630
01:15:08,538 --> 01:15:10,005
You're God...

631
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:12,808
are you?

632
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:18,547
This world has many.
I'm merely one of them.

633
01:15:19,215 --> 01:15:23,152
There is no defying that fact.

634
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:31,527
I hit him!

635
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:42,638
We'll live together!

636
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:45,208
I'll end this!

637
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:47,810
Die!

638
01:15:55,818 --> 01:15:57,086
I got it.

639
01:15:57,887 --> 01:15:58,921
I see.

640
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:04,227
I can finish him off!

641
01:16:11,634 --> 01:16:13,569
He's just shooting blind.

642
01:17:08,157 --> 01:17:09,292
Kato!

643
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:55,798
I got the Big Boss.

644
01:20:58,153 --> 01:20:59,321
It's over.

645
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,225
It's really over.

646
01:22:37,186 --> 01:22:38,320
But I...

647
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:42,257
I was of no help.

648
01:22:43,225 --> 01:22:44,459
Me neither.

649
01:22:45,227 --> 01:22:47,129
Kato did everything.

650
01:22:49,298 --> 01:22:50,399
Where is he?

651
01:22:51,533 --> 01:22:52,501
Oh, no!

652
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,537
I guess he's dead.

653
01:22:57,506 --> 01:22:59,074
No...

654
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:01,510
He did so much...

655
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:03,378
Gantz.

656
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:06,114
Score me.

657
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,491
Live from Osaka.

658
01:23:16,392 --> 01:23:20,329
With no explosions,
the Dotonbori area is very quiet.

659
01:23:20,396 --> 01:23:21,430
EAT BY YOURSELF.

660
01:23:22,765 --> 01:23:25,467
There's no sign of the creatures.

661
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:30,339
Soldiers are assessing the situation.

662
01:23:33,142 --> 01:23:35,511
We only returned because of Kato...

663
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:04,139
Kato!

664
01:24:06,675 --> 01:24:08,043
I...

665
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,512
You survived.

666
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,247
Oh, God!

667
01:24:13,115 --> 01:24:14,750
I'm so happy.

668
01:24:16,185 --> 01:24:17,653
You barely made it.

669
01:24:26,328 --> 01:24:29,131
It's time to score your points.

670
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,143
Jugs, six points.

671
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:46,448
Baldy, two points.

672
01:24:50,252 --> 01:24:52,254
Nishi, 12 points.

673
01:24:55,224 --> 01:24:58,193
It's your turn, Kato.

674
01:25:03,165 --> 01:25:06,334
Kato-cha, LOL, 100 points.

675
01:25:06,869 --> 01:25:08,637
-Shit!
-Amazing!

676
01:25:08,704 --> 01:25:10,338
You cleared it!

677
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:12,574
Did I...?

678
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:17,546
Bonus menu.

679
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:21,783
One, weapon.
Two, resurrection. Three, freedom.

680
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:37,732
2. RESURRECT A DEAD PLAYER.

681
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,868
3. HAVE YOUR MEMORY WIPED AND QUIT.

682
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,703
Choose three and you're free.

683
01:25:42,471 --> 01:25:46,208
And go back to living
with your brother like before.

684
01:25:46,908 --> 01:25:47,910
I'm happy for you.

685
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:50,913
Kato.

686
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:53,181
Thank you.

687
01:25:53,849 --> 01:25:55,217
Goodbye.

688
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:56,818
Have a nice life.

689
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:33,488
Hey...?

690
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:38,960
I didn't die...

691
01:26:50,472 --> 01:26:51,773
Oh, that fool...

692
01:26:54,509 --> 01:26:56,878
That hypocrite!

693
01:27:02,417 --> 01:27:06,421
KATO-CHA (LOL) 100 POINTS

694
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:25,340
You think she was resurrected?

695
01:27:26,608 --> 01:27:28,677
But why, Kato?

696
01:27:29,311 --> 01:27:31,646
What about your brother?

697
01:27:32,581 --> 01:27:35,017
You'll have to join the game again.

698
01:27:35,717 --> 01:27:37,485
You could die.

699
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:41,490
But I made her a promise.

700
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:49,765
That's lame.

701
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:56,972
I can leave?

702
01:28:02,577 --> 01:28:05,614
My brother's waiting at home!

703
01:28:21,063 --> 01:28:22,831
You didn't tell Kato

704
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:26,668
that he used to fight with us.

705
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:28,637
Your brother's waiting.

706
01:28:30,872 --> 01:28:32,073
Choose three.

707
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:36,578
Kei...

708
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:48,390
If I had, he'd fight to resurrect
everyone who'd ever died in the game.

709
01:28:49,591 --> 01:28:50,826
You're right.

710
01:28:57,332 --> 01:29:00,335
I choose three. Free me.

711
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:11,613
I never thought he'd be back!

712
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:16,017
He hasn't changed a bit.

713
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:21,656
Every time it's the same for him.

714
01:29:22,624 --> 01:29:25,960
He risks his life for others.

715
01:29:28,096 --> 01:29:30,799
Kurono was like that, too.

716
01:29:35,737 --> 01:29:37,105
I'll do the same.

717
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:41,376
One day...

718
01:29:42,811 --> 01:29:44,646
I'll get Kurono back.

719
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:01,429
I'm home!

720
01:35:20,048 --> 01:35:22,050
