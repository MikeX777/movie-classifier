1
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:22,768
<i>I think again because of the brutality
of the killing here, the circumstances...</i>

2
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:26,076
Out top story tonight. A salvage murder in the
4th parish has brought the locals there..

3
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:30,292
<i>Shaping up as one of the most
disturbing story of 1988 so far.</i>

4
00:00:30,326 --> 00:00:35,182
<i>Martha Livingston allegedly killed four
of her friends before hanging herself...</i>

5
00:00:35,226 --> 00:00:37,688
<i>in what the authorities are calling
a ritualistic murder...</i>

6
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:44,010
<i>a cult related case. It's the biggest
thing that happens since Lizzie Borden</i>

7
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:48,977
<i>5 young people killed as part of a
bizarre satanic ritual...</i>

8
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:55,635
<i>WFAL7 Jean Stanton, is live at
Lawford parish with that story...</i>

9
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,813
<i>Neighbors said they are puzzled that someone they described
as quiet and who kept to herself could be capable of the.. </i>.

10
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:04,125
<i>Those around this area surely remembered the
Martha Livingston murders that shocked all..</i>

11
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,718
<i>More than twenty years after the
Livingston murders, some...</i>

12
00:01:06,743 --> 00:01:11,771
<i>residence maintained paranormal phenomena
played a role in those murders..</i>

13
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:16,793
<i>It's Grace's first time using a medium
to cleanse a house of negative energy...</i>

14
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:21,379
<i>but she is willing to try anyway... </ i. >
- It's interesting because we'll do an open house and...</i>

15
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:24,912
<i>people would walk in and like:
"Who lived here and why did they moved</i>

16
00:01:24,938 --> 00:01:26,593
- <i>Did somebody die in here?</i>
- <i>.. Someone says</i>

17
00:01:26,618 --> 00:01:31,094
<i>that ghosts are nothing more than lost
souls who were stuck in their sorrows...</i>.

18
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,516
<i>But whatever you believe about
the afterlife, it's undeniable</i>

19
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:38,798
<i>that something horrific happened
in this house all those years ago...</i>

20
00:02:05,867 --> 00:02:07,747
I'll be there.

21
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:11,634
I said I'll be there.

22
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:15,324
Why am I in a bad mood?

23
00:02:15,778 --> 00:02:20,570
Uh... Deb heard noises next door,
wanted me to check it out.

24
00:02:20,596 --> 00:02:21,969
Yeah.

25
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,591
Livingston House.

26
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,829
No, it's completely quiet.

27
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,022
I'll call you back.

28
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:30,670
This is probably a stupid question,
but this is the best you got?

29
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:34,467
- Very stupid question.
- Huh, ha, ha, ha. I'll take it.

30
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,432
- Hello.
- Hi Detective. Sorry to bother you but I got a call

31
00:03:38,457 --> 00:03:41,526
about a disturbance from the 4 LaForte Road
out by the section of the swarm.

32
00:03:41,551 --> 00:03:44,622
We need immediately assistance and
my closest officer is 20 minutes out.

33
00:03:44,647 --> 00:03:47,100
Uh no. That's alright Margery,
I'm 2 minutes away I'll take it.

34
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,502
Sorry, to bother you.
I know you had a date tonight.

35
00:03:49,538 --> 00:03:53,151
If only the bad guys respected
my social calendar.

36
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:46,600
Halt!

37
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,764
Goddamn it, Leonard.
You scared the shit out of me.

38
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,822
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

39
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,031
- What the hell is going on?
- There's blood in there.

40
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:59,992
- Stay here. Do not move.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41
00:05:06,355 --> 00:05:08,985
Police!

42
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,153
Police.

43
00:05:48,735 --> 00:05:54,856
This is detective Lewis. Requesting backup
and EMS vehicles at number 4 LaForte Road.

44
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:59,214
I repeat. I need backup and
EMS vehicles at number 4 LaForte Road.

45
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,778
- Copy that.

46
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,485
Police!

47
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:09,259
Margery, where...

48
00:08:11,797 --> 00:08:16,065
Police! Hold it boy.
Stop. I said stop.

49
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,855
Stop...!

50
00:08:20,548 --> 00:08:23,322
Stay down.
Stay down.

51
00:08:25,277 --> 00:08:26,982
Alright.
Alright, alright.

52
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:28,947
You okay?

53
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:32,240
Look at me. Look at me.
Stay with me. You okay?

54
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:34,639
Alright.
You're okay.

55
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:37,142
You're okay...

56
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:42,658
ONE WEEK EARLIER

57
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:45,096
Are you okay?

58
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:46,607
John?

59
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:49,076
John?

60
00:08:51,994 --> 00:08:53,904
Are you okay?

61
00:08:55,192 --> 00:08:57,601
Are you gonna answer my brother?

62
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:01,404
Yeah. Sorry man,
what was the question?

63
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,836
You were talking about
what you saw in the house.

64
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:07,955
You said you were
having visions of her.

65
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:11,259
I just want to clarify who the 'her' was.

66
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:14,028
Was it one of the victims, or uh..

67
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,082
- ... the owner of the house?
- No.

68
00:09:17,678 --> 00:09:19,576
No, it was my mum.

69
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,658
She died a few years ago,
and uh...

70
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:34,505
I don't know. I just keep...
seeing her in this house...

71
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,883
but I've never been inside of it before.

72
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:41,240
She's... sitting there.

73
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:44,466
Smiling.

74
00:09:45,764 --> 00:09:48,230
Telling me to let go.

75
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:52,765
She is younger than I remembered her.
She's closer to my age.

76
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:55,283
And you've always had these visions?

77
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:58,822
No, only just started a few months ago.

78
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:02,549
This is a...
This is really great stuff.

79
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:04,859
Bryan's going to love this.

80
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,855
Bryan?

81
00:10:07,282 --> 00:10:09,386
Yeah, Bryan Purcell.

82
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:18,177
Hey. Hey, please don't walk away from this. I
feel like we are actually getting somewhere.

83
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,250
- Why didn't you tell me that Bryan was involved?
- Because I didn't think it mattered.

84
00:10:21,284 --> 00:10:23,826
You didn't think that it matter that
your ex-boyfriend was coming along?

85
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,808
It's was three years ago.

86
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:31,738
Look. I was going to tell you, but I needed
to know if you would come first.

87
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:36,335
Hey, look. Sam, I appreciate what
you're trying to do man, but I uh....

88
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,424
- I don't this stuff to cure my nightmares okay.
- Okay.

89
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:43,403
But visions like this aren't just going to
go away unless we really hit them head on.

90
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:46,681
- What does that mean head on?
- It means we go to the house.

91
00:10:46,716 --> 00:10:48,509
Once inside of it, we'll
evaluate your connection.

92
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:52,065
See if these visions have any sense of
realistic within the structure itself.

93
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,466
Yeah.
Bryan?

94
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,407
Bryan, Jules and Donnie would be there
to evaluate the paranormal aspects..

95
00:10:57,442 --> 00:11:00,025
They believe that where there were victims,
there are spirits.

96
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:01,167
No.

97
00:11:01,192 --> 00:11:05,624
Bryan does not care about victims, or
spirits, or anything going on with me, okay.

98
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:09,433
He is an opportunist who only
cares about capturing ghost on tape,

99
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:11,078
so that he can make as
much money out of it as he can.

100
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:14,759
Which is why he is going to insist,
we go with or without you.

101
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:19,823
Look. A lot of unexplained things happened
in that house all those years ago.

102
00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:23,490
I think that when your mother heard
about it, it stucked with her.

103
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:26,865
I think those things haunted her.
Like they are haunting you.

104
00:11:27,148 --> 00:11:29,533
But hey. Don't listen to me to me.

105
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:33,135
It's your mom.
She's the one telling you to let go.

106
00:11:38,354 --> 00:11:40,519
You haven't slept in weeks.

107
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:43,663
I understand your skepticism,

108
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:46,768
and this might not work.
But what if it does?

109
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:51,129
Just try it.

110
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:53,179
Please.

111
00:11:53,283 --> 00:11:56,931
Her name is Michelle Chapman.
We think she's the suspect's girlfriend.

112
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:59,184
No sign of her yet but we
did find her purse inside.

113
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,088
- Let me try to pull the prints from the murder weapon.
- Alright.

114
00:12:02,144 --> 00:12:04,615
- Don’t hang around on my account. Go find some prints.
- Yes sir.

115
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,350
Here, here, here...

116
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,258
- How many are there?
- So far 13 cameras.

117
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:19,023
Almost the entire house is covered,
but we're not seeing anything.

118
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:22,145
- God damn it. Erased?
- No. Scrambled. Dead air.

119
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:24,100
There's recorded information but...

120
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:28,005
We got a mass murderer from that many angles, and
you are telling me we don't have a single thing?

121
00:12:28,015 --> 00:12:31,649
- I have a good feeling about this.
- Henry, what are you doing with the freezer?

122
00:12:31,673 --> 00:12:34,506
- Sometimes freezing the drives helps the data recovery.
- Henry...

123
00:12:34,532 --> 00:12:36,318
there's going to be more murders
if you screw up those drives.

124
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:37,748
I'm telling you right now.

125
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:39,265
Look. We'll bagged it.

126
00:12:39,306 --> 00:12:42,258
And we'll try to defragment the data files
and see if we can recovery anything but...

127
00:12:42,306 --> 00:12:45,793
6 drives, 2 terabytes full of raw data
could take sometime.

128
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,777
- Hey, Percy.
- Hey, Percy.

129
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:07,311
- His rights been read?
- Yes sir. Reeves got it.

130
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:19,952
How are you doing, John?

131
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,688
- Have you found Michelle yet?
- Not yet, so...

132
00:13:25,713 --> 00:13:28,090
Hoping you could help us with that.

133
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:32,476
- He took her. He took her away.
- Who took her?

134
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:35,756
I got to go find her.
'Cos he couldn’t have gone far.

135
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:39,063
How many of you were there, John. 6?
Were there 6 of you?

136
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:41,133
Are you listening to me?

137
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,517
You got to get out there and...
find her.

138
00:13:44,548 --> 00:13:47,711
We're looking for Michelle right now.
I promise you that.

139
00:13:47,798 --> 00:13:52,914
But what I need from you right now is...
tell me who is missing?

140
00:13:53,072 --> 00:13:56,809
John, look at these photos right here.
And tell me who is missing?

141
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:04,975
- Bryan Purcell.
- Bryan Purcell.

142
00:14:08,802 --> 00:14:12,100
- When's the last time you saw Bryan?
- I don't know.

143
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,522
You don't know? You said he took her.
Where did he take her?

144
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:17,000
- I don't know.
- Where?

145
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:20,913
- It happened so fast. I don't know.
- Did Bryan Purcell kill these people, here?

146
00:14:20,938 --> 00:14:23,173
Did he kill your friends?

147
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:25,850
No?

148
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:28,157
It was the house.

149
00:14:29,017 --> 00:14:30,624
It was the house.

150
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:34,597
The house did...
did something to him.

151
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,004
"The house did something to him."

152
00:14:38,219 --> 00:14:41,485
If that could hold up in the court
of the law, John. You know...

153
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:44,846
Usually convicted houses
in the state Louisiana.

154
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:47,304
This house is different.

155
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:49,304
What were you doing
in the house, John?

156
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,019
They woke it up.
They...

157
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:55,713
They try to contact to the other side
and they woke it up.

158
00:14:55,739 --> 00:14:58,595
They woke it up.
They woke up the house.

159
00:14:58,635 --> 00:15:00,889
I only did it for Michelle.

160
00:15:00,969 --> 00:15:04,163
It's my fault. Please be alive.
- John....

161
00:15:04,188 --> 00:15:05,490
Please be alive.

162
00:15:05,514 --> 00:15:07,788
Listen to me John.
I need you to stay calm, okay.

163
00:15:07,812 --> 00:15:12,270
If it was Bryan.You have to find him.
Before he hurts Michelle.

164
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:13,962
Okay.
You have to find him!

165
00:15:13,988 --> 00:15:17,729
- We will.
- Please... Please...

166
00:15:18,472 --> 00:15:21,399
Please.

167
00:15:26,476 --> 00:15:29,870
Detective. No prints on the axe.
Wiped clean.

168
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,969
There can't be any prints on the axe, Jenkins.
The house did it.

169
00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:34,192
Sir?

170
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,667
- Never mind.
- You want me to bring him to the station?

171
00:15:36,692 --> 00:15:38,836
Uh..no. I want you to keep him here.

172
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:41,792
We got two people out there,
could be victims, could be killers.

173
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,841
Right now this guy is my only shoot
at putting this thing together

174
00:15:43,865 --> 00:15:46,235
- So I want him close to me, yeah.
- Yes sir.

175
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:49,168
- Keep him here... Okay.
- Yes sir.

176
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,400
Dispatch.
That's a negative on the transport.

177
00:16:10,461 --> 00:16:12,581
- Hi.
- Hey.

178
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:16,378
- It's... it's me. You busy?
- Yeah, I'm busy being stood up.

179
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:20,015
- I'm sorry about that, something came up.
- Two hours I've been waiting, Lewis.

180
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,585
If you could just let me
get a word in.

181
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,690
I got a triple homicide here
in the Livingston house.

182
00:16:26,672 --> 00:16:28,076
What?

183
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:31,716
- Martha Livingston?
- Yeah.

184
00:16:31,918 --> 00:16:33,693
Do you have someone in custody?

185
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:37,480
I do. I do. But uh... he's in shock right now.
Says he can't remembers anything

186
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:40,992
Plus I got 2 people who are missing,
the entire force is looking for.

187
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:45,262
- Oh. Copycat crime maybe.
- No, no... no maybe.

188
00:16:45,301 --> 00:16:48,646
- Kid saying they woke the house up.
- Huh.

189
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:50,586
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm on my way.

190
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:52,651
- Alright good, it's a date.

191
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:56,393
No, no. It was suppose to be a date.
It's definitely not a date.

192
00:16:59,057 --> 00:17:01,330
- Reeves.
- Yes sir.

193
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:04,086
Get everything you can on
the Livingston case, okay.

194
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,730
Yes, yes sir.

195
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:16,213
Hello... it's Jules here.
I'm in the car... waiting. So bored.

196
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:18,797
- Bryan, say something.
- Uh. (car horn)

197
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:23,537
Where are they?

198
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:25,397
Speak of the devil.

199
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,598
Let's go, you lovebirds.

200
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:33,131
Hey.

201
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:34,761
Donnie.

202
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:36,175
Donnie.

203
00:17:36,604 --> 00:17:40,800
You didn't speak with real people today.
You okay with that?

204
00:17:41,257 --> 00:17:44,866
- Don’t waste the batteries, Jules.
- Give me the camera.

205
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:49,537
- Hey guys.
- Jules.

206
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:53,394
- Good morning, Michelle. Good morning John.
- Hi.

207
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:58,423
You guys are perfect for each other.
Matching haircuts and everything.

208
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:00,450
Oh... your's looks like a wet dog.

209
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:04,911
Truth. - You're the third John Michelle
dated since she's been with me. So...

210
00:18:05,057 --> 00:18:10,208
Truth.- It's so clear that you're not over Michelle,
and it's really embarrassing for you, man.

211
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:11,902
Nice bangs (hair).

212
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:15,811
Hey. Even though you're not the first,
but definitely the most interesting.

213
00:18:15,836 --> 00:18:18,363
A honest to god, a haunted house
in the mounts of Louisiana?

214
00:18:18,387 --> 00:18:19,509
It's not a haunted
house, Bryan.

215
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:21,888
- Let's go find out.
- Bryan. Lay off.

216
00:18:22,911 --> 00:18:26,747
- Hey. Your eyes look great on film.
- Those aren't my eyes, Bryan.

217
00:18:29,952 --> 00:18:33,887
That's something.
Anything from inside the house?

218
00:18:33,948 --> 00:18:35,928
Nothing yet.
Still working on it.

219
00:18:35,952 --> 00:18:38,413
Jenkins, where're we at on the
background for the Purcell kid?

220
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:39,775
Should have it any minute.

221
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:42,990
- Detective Klein just landed.
She 's walking up.

222
00:18:43,016 --> 00:18:44,865
Good, good, good, good.

223
00:18:46,577 --> 00:18:47,892
Hey.

224
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:50,519
Good excuse to miss date night.

225
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:53,296
- Ha. It's called a phone call.
- I know.

226
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:55,872
I mean, assuming you can get this
guy to make some sense.

227
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:58,976
Because right now he's just mumbling
about how the house did it.

228
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:02,148
- I'm sure you are very understanding about that.
- Seeing how I don't even like when you read my horoscope.

229
00:19:02,173 --> 00:19:04,941
No, I'm not interested in talking about
the house is a murder suspect.

230
00:19:04,965 --> 00:19:06,885
- So, where is he?
- What? Wait.

231
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:09,981
When this is all over.
I still got a bottle of wine in my car.

232
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:14,468
I tell you what. I'll share that wine with you,
if you let me read your horoscope. How's that?

233
00:19:14,492 --> 00:19:16,368
- Not a chance.
- Hm.

234
00:19:21,883 --> 00:19:23,165
Klein.

235
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:24,572
Henry.

236
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:28,346
John.
This is Dr. Elizabeth Klein.

237
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:31,169
She's the department psychologist.

238
00:19:31,874 --> 00:19:34,678
Hello, John.
I'm Elizabeth.

239
00:19:34,702 --> 00:19:36,291
How're you doing, huh?

240
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:38,928
I'm going to let you two talk.

241
00:19:38,952 --> 00:19:41,353
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Okay.

242
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:43,718
Hey.

243
00:19:45,455 --> 00:19:47,247
You might be in a
little bit of shock.

244
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:50,595
- Henry, can you get me the blanket please.
- Of course.

245
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,605
After a traumatic experience like this,
most people shut down.

246
00:19:57,891 --> 00:19:59,921
So you are not alone.

247
00:20:00,176 --> 00:20:04,769
But the thing that gets most people moving
is to have a strong purpose

248
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:08,416
Let me show you that purpose.
Can you do that John?

249
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:13,036
Can you?

250
00:20:17,415 --> 00:20:20,769
I never should have told her
about this place.

251
00:20:23,242 --> 00:20:26,691
Who shouldn't you have told that?
Michelle?

252
00:20:27,406 --> 00:20:28,516
She...

253
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,385
She used to...
hang out with them.

254
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:35,038
Before I met her.

255
00:20:36,596 --> 00:20:39,795
'Hunting ghosts',
they called it.

256
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,845
Is that what they were here for?

257
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:50,306
Hey, the police said you blacked out.
It's probably from the shock.

258
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:54,291
Is there anything at all that you
can tell me, that you remember?

259
00:20:55,145 --> 00:20:59,104
I can remember some stuff
from earlier today.

260
00:20:59,994 --> 00:21:04,365
Why don't you walk me through what you remember.
Maybe it'll help to bring something up.

261
00:21:05,637 --> 00:21:07,715
I can try.

262
00:21:12,642 --> 00:21:15,284
Alright.
A little introduction here.

263
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:21,028
Samuel B. Chapman. Looking very serious
and smart with his energy drink.

264
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:24,916
Jules Carter, our occult specialist /
research guru.

265
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:27,648
- I'm also a sexy bitch.
- That you are.

266
00:21:27,673 --> 00:21:32,946
Donald Smith, technological connoisseur
and resident mouth breather.

267
00:21:32,976 --> 00:21:34,561
Alright.
Alright...

268
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:37,436
Do it.
Go...

269
00:21:38,057 --> 00:21:41,857
- Go. Put your meat in his mouth.
- He's taking it.

270
00:21:41,939 --> 00:21:43,258
I'm waiting.

271
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:49,008
Damn redneck, hillbillies.

272
00:21:58,162 --> 00:22:01,298
So tell us what's been happening with you.

273
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,037
Uh well...

274
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:07,923
The house that we're going to is in a
small town where my mom grew up.

275
00:22:07,948 --> 00:22:13,221
And... about 25 years ago,
there was an incident.

276
00:22:13,247 --> 00:22:15,770
I think they called it mass murder.

277
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:19,444
Yeah.
The Martha Livingston murders.

278
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,655
But no one lived in the house since.

279
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:23,217
How you know the house?

280
00:22:23,249 --> 00:22:27,294
Growing up, my mom was kind of
friends with Martha Livingston.

281
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:31,077
The girl who lived there
and, who... you know..

282
00:22:31,103 --> 00:22:33,021
Did she ever talked to you
about the murders?

283
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:38,337
No, no. No one talk about it. I think
the whole town just want it to go away.

284
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:41,247
You don't think this is real, do you?

285
00:22:41,271 --> 00:22:42,442
No.

286
00:22:42,467 --> 00:22:44,900
I think we actually do the things
that we can say we can do, right?

287
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,671
- Bryan, easy up man. This is just an interview.
- Shut the hell up.

288
00:22:46,695 --> 00:22:49,461
I just want to know why this guy
always acts he's too cool for all of us.

289
00:22:49,486 --> 00:22:51,238
Not all of you, Bryan.

290
00:22:51,262 --> 00:22:55,470
Fuck. You know what I think. I think
you're actually curious about this house.

291
00:22:55,494 --> 00:22:58,073
You think there's some kind of connection
that you can't fully explain.

292
00:22:58,097 --> 00:23:02,417
You don't believe any of this, of course. Because
we're all full of shit. And here you are.

293
00:23:02,452 --> 00:23:05,825
So why don't you admit that deep down you
hope that we can make sense of this for you.

294
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:07,257
Bryan, stop.

295
00:23:07,281 --> 00:23:09,885
You don't have to come here with us.
You know that.

296
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:14,431
They were gonna edit a documentary,
trying to capture spirits on film.

297
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:20,208
So. Once you got to the house.
Did you manage to capture spirits?

298
00:23:23,976 --> 00:23:26,233
Oh.
Alright.

299
00:23:26,311 --> 00:23:29,800
- Watch the mud.
- Yeah. Watch your shoes.

300
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:34,385
What are those?

301
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:36,791
I think they're Abilene chimes.

302
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:40,442
- Suppose to beckon the dead.
- There's more.

303
00:23:40,468 --> 00:23:42,000
Holy shit.

304
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:47,009
- Am I crazy? I don't feel any wind.
- It's acting weird.

305
00:23:51,018 --> 00:23:52,338
Aw...!

306
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:54,756
- What. Are you okay?
- Aw.

307
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:56,587
- What happened?
- Aw...

308
00:23:56,613 --> 00:23:59,224
You guys...
are so gullible.

309
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,778
- Oh... my god.
- Ha, ha, ha. You make funny jokes.

310
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:05,635
What?
No?

311
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:06,846
Come on.

312
00:24:06,872 --> 00:24:08,887
- You like it.
- No.

313
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:10,971
- Tough crowd.
- Let's go.

314
00:24:17,816 --> 00:24:19,894
Donnie, catch up.

315
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:48,003
Is this real?

316
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,699
Ah...
Jesus.

317
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,748
- At least this house isn't open to visitors.
- Why you say that?

318
00:24:56,772 --> 00:24:59,321
That gas lamp dates back to 1800s.

319
00:24:59,348 --> 00:25:02,868
Used to use as a few passing by on the road
could see if the master of the house is home.

320
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:07,375
- It was open for guest, when it was lit, meant it was.
- I promise we'll be good guest.

321
00:25:07,414 --> 00:25:10,038
Let's uh... be up and running in an hour.
Yeah.

322
00:25:10,063 --> 00:25:13,657
Thing is going to take sometime, I don't really
want to stay here longer than we have to.

323
00:25:13,682 --> 00:25:17,066
- What thing?
- It's an evocation. It's like a seance.

324
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,221
We try to summon the spirits to see if you
could get the victims to communicate.

325
00:25:20,246 --> 00:25:23,314
What if we summon Martha
Livingston instead?

326
00:25:23,338 --> 00:25:27,107
We won't, because among other precautions. We're
only going to use good energies to summon.

327
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,999
Good energy.

328
00:25:28,023 --> 00:25:29,627
- Yeah.
- Alright.

329
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,991
So let me see if I have this straight?

330
00:25:32,017 --> 00:25:36,041
You guys came to the house to do a seance
to communicate with the dead.

331
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:43,636
And it's so happens that Martha Livingston and her
friends also did a seance in this house 2 decades ago.

332
00:25:45,027 --> 00:25:47,205
Do you see what I'm getting at?

333
00:25:53,296 --> 00:25:58,154
It seems that someone intended to repeat
the murders in exactly the same way.

334
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,046
That happened 20 years ago.

335
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:11,183
I don't know if it's Bryan Purcell,
or someone else or you.

336
00:26:11,344 --> 00:26:17,058
But the truth is if we don't to the bottom of this, you
are looking at spending the rest of your life in prison.

337
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:23,134
And I've to tell you when that happens, I'm
not going to be able to help you anymore.

338
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,810
I just... I just....
I want to remember.

339
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:31,476
All I care about is that
they find Michelle.

340
00:26:31,605 --> 00:26:34,583
And...
And that she's alive.

341
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:39,558
So tell me.
How did you get inside the house?

342
00:27:02,984 --> 00:27:06,102
- Oh my god, this place is awesome.
- Alright.

343
00:27:12,784 --> 00:27:15,419
Shut off your phones,
so I can read the house.

344
00:27:17,414 --> 00:27:19,037
- John, are you okay?
- Why?

345
00:27:19,061 --> 00:27:20,463
- You're bleeding.
- What?

346
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:21,930
Your nose is bleeding.

347
00:27:24,624 --> 00:27:28,979
- Does that happened to you a lot?
- Uh, no. No, never.

348
00:27:29,003 --> 00:27:33,484
He gets sensitive to change in pressure. I'd see
that happens before when spirits are around.

349
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:36,707
Congratulations.
Popped your cherry.

350
00:27:37,193 --> 00:27:39,048
It's a good sign.

351
00:27:45,713 --> 00:27:47,740
Alright, let's get audio
and video up.

352
00:27:47,771 --> 00:27:52,060
Donnie set up the batteries and don't
be afraid to tell people what you need.

353
00:27:52,086 --> 00:27:55,272
It doesn't sounds good If things happened,
we don't get it on camera.

354
00:27:57,082 --> 00:28:00,840
Why did Sam Chapman think you had
such a connection to the house?

355
00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:04,856
So your mother knew Martha and the victims, but so what.
What does that have to do with you?

356
00:28:04,868 --> 00:28:06,954
I'm trying to understand that.

357
00:28:08,328 --> 00:28:09,989
My mother...

358
00:28:12,412 --> 00:28:15,410
She was inside the house,
the night of the murders.

359
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:18,396
You mean Sara Matthews?

360
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:20,992
The one who escaped.
That was your mother?

361
00:28:21,203 --> 00:28:22,951
I didn't tell the crew...

362
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:25,094
or Michelle.
But...

363
00:28:25,118 --> 00:28:27,207
Looking back.
I... I should have.

364
00:28:27,231 --> 00:28:32,065
John, hon. This is not going to look good
in a court of law. You know that, right?

365
00:28:32,154 --> 00:28:35,082
All I can do...
is just tell the truth.

366
00:28:35,106 --> 00:28:36,657
It's all I can do.

367
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:39,551
And the truth is
you have visions.

368
00:28:39,576 --> 00:28:40,914
Yes.

369
00:28:41,349 --> 00:28:44,747
Of my mom in the house.

370
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,592
Tell me that I...
I need to let go.

371
00:28:54,894 --> 00:28:58,115
Yo. Here's your walkie.

372
00:28:58,141 --> 00:28:59,375
Thanks.

373
00:29:01,393 --> 00:29:04,357
- This must be the infamous Martha Livingston.
- Yeah.

374
00:29:04,383 --> 00:29:06,188
She's kind of hot.

375
00:29:06,385 --> 00:29:08,856
- I would do her.
- Me too.

376
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:12,367
You know any of those birds?

377
00:29:12,393 --> 00:29:16,892
It's a grackle. It's an important symbol
to the people of the occult.

378
00:29:17,195 --> 00:29:21,884
Said it was used as a messenger in the old
world between the devil and his followers.

379
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,459
Oh shit.

380
00:29:24,123 --> 00:29:28,023
- You got to be careful.
- Don't tell Bryan.

381
00:29:28,721 --> 00:29:30,426
I'm going to tell him.

382
00:29:31,156 --> 00:29:33,577
- It was an accident.
- I have to tell him.

383
00:29:33,883 --> 00:29:36,233
You leave me no choice.

384
00:29:41,935 --> 00:29:44,989
Okay dude. I think this is going to be
the best room for evocation.

385
00:29:45,013 --> 00:29:47,464
It's got like the highest reading.

386
00:29:51,471 --> 00:29:53,161
No way.

387
00:29:53,522 --> 00:29:56,568
What...
Camera Glasses?

388
00:29:58,701 --> 00:30:00,242
What did I say?

389
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:04,471
- Don't touch anything.
- Chill there, Bryan.

390
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,888
Attic's clear.

391
00:31:01,145 --> 00:31:04,056
I'm not getting a feed from your camera.

392
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,948
Okay, copy that.

393
00:31:20,538 --> 00:31:24,205
Uh... it's almost.
Yeah, that did it.

394
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,474
You got it.

395
00:31:28,144 --> 00:31:32,334
I... want to put a baby in you.

396
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:53,834
Anyone here?

397
00:32:25,967 --> 00:32:28,051
My name is Sam Chapman.

398
00:32:28,885 --> 00:32:33,296
We're trapped inside the house.
He's gone... crazy.

399
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,403
He's got an axe.

400
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:38,810
He's gone crazy.
He is killing everyone.

401
00:32:38,836 --> 00:32:40,875
I don't know what to do?

402
00:32:43,617 --> 00:32:45,557
I just want to go home.

403
00:32:45,636 --> 00:32:46,877
I just want to go home.

404
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:49,130
Aw...!

405
00:32:59,707 --> 00:33:01,209
Oh my god...

406
00:33:01,233 --> 00:33:03,574
How did you retrieve these files.
How did you do this?

407
00:33:04,162 --> 00:33:05,806
The uh..
The frozen hard drives sir.

408
00:33:05,829 --> 00:33:09,003
Okay, get another freezer down here. I want
you to freeze all these hard drives. Now!

409
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,435
- Okay.
- Yes sir.

410
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:15,492
Just try, if you can.
There must be something else.

411
00:33:15,518 --> 00:33:16,972
Dr. Klein.

412
00:33:17,258 --> 00:33:19,441
Excuse me for a second, John.

413
00:33:22,883 --> 00:33:25,800
- How's it going?
- You are not going to believe this.

414
00:33:25,861 --> 00:33:29,332
- Sara Matthews was his mother.
- Who is that?

415
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:33,729
The lone survivor. The one who escaped
before Martha could murder her.

416
00:33:33,753 --> 00:33:35,461
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not kidding you.

417
00:33:35,487 --> 00:33:38,612
Jesus Christ. The more I learned
about this kid, the less I trust him.

418
00:33:38,692 --> 00:33:42,297
Alright. Tell him we going through
the footage, we can't get anything.

419
00:33:42,324 --> 00:33:44,452
- Go at him with that. See how he reacts.
- Okay, I will.

420
00:33:44,478 --> 00:33:49,217
Also get the guys to look for some interview
tapes from Sara Matthews soon after the murders.

421
00:33:49,242 --> 00:33:50,235
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

422
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,620
I'm going back in.
I think we're get somewhere. - (Alright)

423
00:33:53,307 --> 00:33:55,061
Hey.
John.

424
00:33:56,563 --> 00:33:59,190
This is strange but um...

425
00:33:59,878 --> 00:34:02,893
They can't get any footage
from inside the house.

426
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,974
I don't understand.

427
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,960
You guys came all the way down here
to document a haunted house.

428
00:34:07,985 --> 00:34:10,420
And then, there's no documentation.

429
00:34:10,445 --> 00:34:12,719
Nothing to show what happened
in that house.

430
00:34:12,744 --> 00:34:14,128
Can you explain that?

431
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:15,739
I don't know.

432
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:19,036
That's my point.
I can't explain it.

433
00:34:20,547 --> 00:34:23,224
I just told you what happened.

434
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,724
Can I just have a little more light?

435
00:34:28,755 --> 00:34:29,876
Oh yeah.

436
00:34:29,903 --> 00:34:33,177
Sorry, I don't want to
get the wrong angles on those ghosts.

437
00:34:33,202 --> 00:34:36,483
- Yeah, that's right.
- Very picky. Diva ghost.

438
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,670
Everything we can do
to get them out, alright.

439
00:34:39,753 --> 00:34:40,552
Wait a second.

440
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:43,317
Can you check this camera.
See there might be something...

441
00:34:43,342 --> 00:34:44,773
It's tilting down or something.
I don't know.

442
00:34:44,797 --> 00:34:46,699
Oh yeah? Is that one
totally broken?

443
00:34:46,724 --> 00:34:48,248
I don't know. There's something wrong.
It just keeps...

444
00:34:48,273 --> 00:34:49,260
I don't know what that is.

445
00:34:49,284 --> 00:34:51,465
That's the reason? It's a broken camera?
- I don't want to check it.

446
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:53,804
It's so broken huh.
That what you want me to fix.

447
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:55,681
You really know what, exactly.

448
00:34:57,726 --> 00:35:00,161
- Are you messing with me?
- No, I didn't.

449
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,010
That wasn't you?

450
00:35:02,034 --> 00:35:03,056
No.

451
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:06,913
I am surprised this is happening.

452
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,286
Hey Jules.
I think this room might actually be...

453
00:35:10,086 --> 00:35:11,728
What the hell was that?

454
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:15,672
I... don’t.
I don't know.

455
00:35:16,612 --> 00:35:19,942
- Something's here.
- Someone is just messing with us.

456
00:35:22,344 --> 00:35:24,467
What happened?
Are you okay?

457
00:35:24,492 --> 00:35:26,311
Did you see that door just closed?

458
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:27,487
No.

459
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:31,579
Shit.
I definitely just saw that.

460
00:35:32,056 --> 00:35:34,835
Give me the camera.
Give me the camera.

461
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,034
Come on. You've just
opened the door for us.

462
00:35:51,686 --> 00:35:53,751
Why don't you tell us why you're here.

463
00:35:53,987 --> 00:35:56,170
Why are you slamming doors?

464
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,876
Show yourself.

465
00:35:57,943 --> 00:36:00,824
Someone just touched me.
Somebody just touched my leg.

466
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:02,900
- Do you see anything in the camera?
- I don't know.

467
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:04,701
- Something just touched me.
- I can't see anything.

468
00:36:04,726 --> 00:36:06,682
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

469
00:36:06,856 --> 00:36:10,625
Everyone is clean except Bryan Purcell.
Purcell was a stiletto issue.

470
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:13,282
Got expelled for threatening a
professor during a disagreement

471
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:15,090
Professor filed a restraining order.

472
00:36:15,115 --> 00:36:17,751
And Chapman says "he" (male) in the tape,
before he gets killed.

473
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:21,105
Narrows it down to 2.
He also said...

474
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:26,222
He also said that they were locked in the house.
But how can you be locked from the inside.

475
00:36:26,248 --> 00:36:29,536
- We found multiple prints on the doorknob.
- Yeah.

476
00:36:29,851 --> 00:36:30,686
I don't know.

477
00:36:30,717 --> 00:36:33,744
If you're lock inside of a house, Jenkins.
How would you try to escape?

478
00:36:33,768 --> 00:36:36,143
Um...
Try to get out through the window.

479
00:36:36,168 --> 00:36:37,318
Boarded.

480
00:36:37,344 --> 00:36:39,940
Or. What about a laundry chute
or something like that?

481
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:41,568
No...

482
00:36:41,914 --> 00:36:43,523
Milk chute.

483
00:36:43,885 --> 00:36:45,389
What's a milk chute?

484
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,623
Old houses like these have them
so that milkman could leave the bottles.

485
00:36:56,487 --> 00:36:57,692
Oh...

486
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,909
Jesus Christ.

487
00:36:59,934 --> 00:37:01,521
A little tight to fit through huh.

488
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:03,981
If only these were the people
we were looking for.

489
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:08,179
I want a picture of this. And I want a
match on the blood type, right away.

490
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:14,626
Where is Michelle, John?

491
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:17,056
- Where's Michelle?
- I don't know.

492
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:18,237
- Mark.
- You don't know?

493
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,045
What's that?

494
00:37:20,626 --> 00:37:23,217
- What... I don't know.
- You don't know what that is?

495
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:26,838
I think she escaped through that milk slot
and I think you were chasing her, boy.

496
00:37:26,862 --> 00:37:27,976
I don't know what
you're talking about.

497
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,413
You don't know what I' talking about or
you can't remember? Which one is it?

498
00:37:30,438 --> 00:37:32,103
- I'm trying to remember.
- You're trying.

499
00:37:32,128 --> 00:37:35,008
Yeah, you try. You know what I thing.
I think you murdered those people.

500
00:37:35,048 --> 00:37:38,423
I think you killed them one by
one just like Martha Livingston.

501
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:40,744
Only Michelle, she got
away from you didn't she?

502
00:37:40,784 --> 00:37:43,367
Just like your mom got away.

503
00:37:43,393 --> 00:37:46,048
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me?

504
00:37:46,085 --> 00:37:48,791
I hope Michelle did get away.
I would never do anything to hurt her

505
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:50,764
- Why's that?
- Because she is pregnant.

506
00:37:50,789 --> 00:37:52,570
She's pregnant?

507
00:37:52,596 --> 00:37:56,224
- She's... she's pregnant.
- She's 10 weeks pregnant.

508
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,762
We weren't telling anyone.

509
00:37:57,788 --> 00:38:00,255
You weren't tell any.
Why didn't you tell me that, John?

510
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,074
I don’t know!

511
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:03,148
Oh, you don't know. You
don't know anything, do you?

512
00:38:03,188 --> 00:38:05,175
You don't know anything.

513
00:38:05,521 --> 00:38:10,409
- I think you killed them, John.
- Mark, can you give us a minute. Please.

514
00:38:10,434 --> 00:38:12,860
Just give us a second, okay.

515
00:38:18,498 --> 00:38:19,878
Hey.

516
00:38:19,903 --> 00:38:22,697
What are you doing?
I was getting somewhere.

517
00:38:22,746 --> 00:38:24,596
You know she was pregnant?

518
00:38:24,626 --> 00:38:29,471
No, but please don't come back until you're invited.
I really was getting somewhere.

519
00:38:29,496 --> 00:38:31,355
So was I.

520
00:38:31,423 --> 00:38:32,902
Okay.

521
00:38:40,572 --> 00:38:44,936
Okay listen, that's what he thinks.
That's not what I think.

522
00:38:44,961 --> 00:38:48,809
You should have told me was pregnant.
I... I understand why now.

523
00:38:57,824 --> 00:39:00,952
This place is so creepy.

524
00:39:15,036 --> 00:39:16,907
Did you just turned that on?

525
00:39:18,762 --> 00:39:21,534
No, I don't think so.

526
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:24,050
Uh, hey guys.
The master bedroom.

527
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:30,255
- What's up?
- What happened?

528
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:33,007
I just uh.
I picked up this ballerina and...

529
00:39:33,032 --> 00:39:36,306
- Come on man. I told you not to touch anything, right.
- Sorry man, I just thought...

530
00:39:36,331 --> 00:39:38,217
Alright. No body asked you to think.
Just don't touch anything.

531
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:39,909
Bryan. Don't be such an asso.
He didn't know what he is doing.

532
00:39:39,947 --> 00:39:46,271
It doesn't matter if it is a couch, a ballerina or
my ex-girlfriend. I don't want you touching things.

533
00:39:57,259 --> 00:40:00,646
- Holy shit.
- Everyone, turn your Walkies off.

534
00:40:00,726 --> 00:40:03,052
He says over the walkie.

535
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,333
- Any other electricity in here besides us?
- No.

536
00:40:17,028 --> 00:40:20,023
- Sam, camera.
- Oh, yeah.

537
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:25,032
This is where it was before John moved it?
- I agree. - That was it.

538
00:40:25,057 --> 00:40:26,217
Yeah.

539
00:40:26,242 --> 00:40:30,588
So I'm just gonna...
put it back.

540
00:40:38,931 --> 00:40:40,876
Come on.

541
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,331
It's like she's resetting.

542
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:50,393
No, she's not resetting.
She... She's pointing.

543
00:40:50,512 --> 00:40:52,739
What's she pointing at, John?

544
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:56,534
The wall?

545
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:01,291
The rug.

546
00:41:02,804 --> 00:41:04,327
Jules.

547
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,215
Oh.
So much for that.

548
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:27,507
Wait. What if that is not the rug
where she's pointing at?

549
00:41:29,336 --> 00:41:32,152
- Donnie. Help me.
- Let's go.

550
00:41:42,847 --> 00:41:45,420
- Oh shit.
- Nobody step in it.

551
00:41:50,246 --> 00:41:53,364
- Guys. What is that?
- Donnie, give me your EMF.

552
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:03,213
It's max out.

553
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:04,614
What is this?

554
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:08,030
It's some kind of seal.
But I haven't seen one like this before.

555
00:42:08,065 --> 00:42:10,070
What do you mean.
Aren't you suppose to know all that shit?

556
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:14,467
Just that, there are thousands of derivatives of seals. They
all have different meanings and different variations. So...

557
00:42:14,492 --> 00:42:17,045
I'm sorry if I'm not
familiar with all of them.

558
00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:19,775
We found the source
of the house' energy.

559
00:42:19,806 --> 00:42:22,438
This is obviously where they
performed their rituals.

560
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:26,068
Which mean.
This is our best spot for communicating.

561
00:42:26,302 --> 00:42:28,710
They may have actually made
contact with the other side.

562
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:31,510
Yeah, and then Martha went crazy
and killed anyone.

563
00:42:31,545 --> 00:42:37,494
The other side didn't make Martha do this, okay.
Because nothing had to make her do this.

564
00:42:37,525 --> 00:42:40,851
She was messed up long before
any of this happened.

565
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,494
My mom used to always say this.

566
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:46,097
Growing up, she was constantly
getting into trouble, getting into fights.

567
00:42:46,128 --> 00:42:50,101
Nothing to push her over the edge.
Martha was already way over.

568
00:42:50,126 --> 00:42:53,599
Guys.
Is that blood?

569
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:58,501
- No. It's just wax.
- I see. Now the shit is getting good.

570
00:42:58,527 --> 00:43:01,384
- You ever seen this seal before, John?
- No.

571
00:43:01,422 --> 00:43:06,786
But when the ballerina is pointed at it,
I knew she meant something else.

572
00:43:17,422 --> 00:43:20,693
- Where is it coming from?
- Hold on, hold on.

573
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,438
Donnie, stay close.

574
00:43:30,155 --> 00:43:32,938
- Shit.
- Michelle, you okay?

575
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:34,760
She's fine.

576
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,681
Where is it coming from?

577
00:43:38,704 --> 00:43:40,420
Jesus.

578
00:43:56,625 --> 00:43:58,655
I got nothing on here.

579
00:44:00,775 --> 00:44:04,128
Careful, careful, careful.
Be careful.

580
00:44:33,248 --> 00:44:36,166
- Jesus Christ.
- What was it?

581
00:44:36,192 --> 00:44:38,172
- Did you see it, see it?
- What was that?

582
00:44:38,197 --> 00:44:39,913
- Did you?
- No!

583
00:44:40,012 --> 00:44:42,003
Oh shit.

584
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:45,311
- What is that?
- What is it?

585
00:44:48,635 --> 00:44:50,856
- Check it out.
- Shit.

586
00:44:51,501 --> 00:44:53,818
Holy shit.

587
00:45:05,193 --> 00:45:07,349
Holy shit.

588
00:45:09,478 --> 00:45:14,969
The blood on the milk chute, matches Bryan Purcell's.
It's B+. So he went through.

589
00:45:16,027 --> 00:45:18,641
So he goes through the chute
and he is bloody.

590
00:45:18,672 --> 00:45:22,018
Question is. Did he go through
as a victim or as a killer?

591
00:45:22,043 --> 00:45:25,059
Why would he go through there, if he could
just walked right out the front door?

592
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:29,099
He's chasing someone, Jenkins.
He's chasing someone, maybe the victim.

593
00:45:29,123 --> 00:45:31,769
So you think Michelle went through it
and Purcell followed it through?

594
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:32,849
Yeah.

595
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:35,373
Which means we got to find them 2
before all hell breaks loose.

596
00:45:35,398 --> 00:45:36,759
You go.
Go, go, go.

597
00:45:36,784 --> 00:45:39,231
Copy that.
Reeves, what's your 20?

598
00:45:39,255 --> 00:45:44,668
Let's talk about Bryan Purcell.
You two obviously weren't close.

599
00:45:45,686 --> 00:45:50,771
I've only met him a few times.
He’s kind of hard to get along with.

600
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:52,929
So you didn't like him?

601
00:45:53,407 --> 00:45:57,684
He was just...
obsessed with this house.

602
00:45:57,708 --> 00:46:02,777
And... he tends on taking things too far.
That's what he did.

603
00:46:03,233 --> 00:46:05,971
Come on baby, where are you?

604
00:46:11,012 --> 00:46:13,148
I know you're here.

605
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:19,052
Where are you?

606
00:46:24,177 --> 00:46:28,472
Okay.
Have it your way.

607
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:37,351
Show yourself.

608
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:45,867
Come on.

609
00:49:22,972 --> 00:49:26,891
What's taking so long?
I don't want to be here all night.

610
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:30,534
Just need another minute.
Got one last thing

611
00:49:38,967 --> 00:49:41,494
- Tha's it, right?
- Yeah.

612
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:45,043
What is that?

613
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:47,552
That's an incredibly
sensitive microphone.

614
00:49:47,577 --> 00:49:50,561
It picks up sounds and frequency
that you can't normally hear.

615
00:49:50,585 --> 00:49:54,996
Records 50 different channels.
It's kind of like a human's inner ear.

616
00:49:55,286 --> 00:49:57,128
How does it work?

617
00:50:08,012 --> 00:50:09,893
What is that?

618
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:15,824
What...?

619
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:27,264
That's cool.

620
00:50:32,476 --> 00:50:34,447
That's us.

621
00:50:35,155 --> 00:50:38,105
Like our.
Our heartbeats?

622
00:50:39,378 --> 00:50:42,259
That heartbeat... it's...

623
00:50:43,387 --> 00:50:47,463
It's like a fourth faster heartbeat.

624
00:50:51,797 --> 00:50:54,402
That's a fifth one.

625
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:56,193
Six...

626
00:50:58,391 --> 00:51:00,942
Seven, maybe more.

627
00:51:09,914 --> 00:51:12,481
- What?
- Someone was just in the room with us.

628
00:51:12,532 --> 00:51:15,210
I swear to god.
Someone was standing right there.

629
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:19,916
- Oh shit! What's happening?
- Donnie, Donnie what've we got?

630
00:51:21,568 --> 00:51:24,005
Oh shit.
Shit, shit.

631
00:51:24,932 --> 00:51:26,842
There's nothing.

632
00:51:35,471 --> 00:51:36,996
John.

633
00:51:39,385 --> 00:51:41,797
What is this?
What the hell just happened?

634
00:51:41,831 --> 00:51:43,952
The painting burst into
flames out of nowhere.

635
00:51:43,978 --> 00:51:47,480
- What do you mean it burst into flames?
- It just burst into flames.

636
00:51:48,422 --> 00:51:51,168
How did you know where the
fire extinguisher was?

637
00:51:54,356 --> 00:51:56,083
I don't know.

638
00:51:58,943 --> 00:52:01,121
Have you seen this room before?

639
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:10,423
Okay, without looking can you ..
Can you tell me what's behind you?

640
00:52:10,449 --> 00:52:12,222
There's a...

641
00:52:12,641 --> 00:52:17,894
There's a tear in...
the wallpaper, and...

642
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:24,159
And underneath it is a
drawing of a little girl.

643
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:29,077
That's weird.

644
00:52:30,882 --> 00:52:33,112
What else?

645
00:52:33,898 --> 00:52:41,637
There is a photograph of
a man in suits and...

646
00:52:42,043 --> 00:52:44,844
And seals behind them.

647
00:52:50,391 --> 00:52:52,358
Holy shit.

648
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:54,820
There's something else.

649
00:52:58,817 --> 00:53:01,690
There's a woman behind Jules.

650
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:06,289
Jules...!

651
00:53:12,869 --> 00:53:14,226
Jules?

652
00:53:14,836 --> 00:53:17,030
Jules. Are you okay.
Jules.

653
00:53:17,063 --> 00:53:18,869
- Come on. We got to get her up.
- Alright, we have to leave now.

654
00:53:18,893 --> 00:53:20,614
Do you realize what just happen?
It was crazy.

655
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:22,918
Oh, you realize it was crazy by her
flying across the room in a shit that far.

656
00:53:22,943 --> 00:53:25,836
I'm saying we should think
about this before we jump ship.

657
00:53:25,862 --> 00:53:28,237
I want to make sure you realize
what we could be sitting on that...

658
00:53:28,262 --> 00:53:30,838
I realized that you are out of your mind
and we're leaving now.

659
00:53:30,909 --> 00:53:32,925
This is what happens
when you make a connection.

660
00:53:32,951 --> 00:53:35,318
You pussy. This is why we're here.

661
00:53:35,342 --> 00:53:38,358
- No! Stop it! Stop it!
- Jules knows this.

662
00:53:38,554 --> 00:53:40,347
Jules.
He doesn't get it, okay.

663
00:53:40,371 --> 00:53:42,538
I'm not leaving.

664
00:53:42,682 --> 00:53:43,965
What? Jules...

665
00:53:44,036 --> 00:53:46,862
We get make fun all the time.
People think we're crazy.

666
00:53:46,887 --> 00:53:49,751
We get ridiculed.
But this shit is why we're here.

667
00:53:50,068 --> 00:53:52,885
What happened was crazy,
but Bryan 's right.

668
00:53:52,911 --> 00:53:54,385
I'm not leaving.

669
00:53:54,411 --> 00:53:55,918
Fine.

670
00:53:56,081 --> 00:54:00,086
- We are... Sam
- Sam.

671
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:02,186
Hey!

672
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,561
You okay?

673
00:54:04,847 --> 00:54:09,528
- Do you really expect me to believe this joke?
- I can only tell you what happened.

674
00:54:09,561 --> 00:54:14,777
- And your friend just flew across the room?
- I wouldn't believe it either before this.

675
00:54:16,251 --> 00:54:17,835
I do now.

676
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:21,157
Hey! Hey!
What're you going to do huh?

677
00:54:21,181 --> 00:54:23,329
You go knocking the doors and:
"Can you help us?

678
00:54:23,362 --> 00:54:24,898
We're down the street
breaking into a house.

679
00:54:24,922 --> 00:54:27,809
We just really need a lift because
our friends kept the car."

680
00:54:28,061 --> 00:54:30,952
I know your mom was in the house
the night of the murders.

681
00:54:31,918 --> 00:54:33,353
What?

682
00:54:33,378 --> 00:54:34,909
Oh, you didn't think
I would find out about that?

683
00:54:34,934 --> 00:54:37,047
What is he talking about?
Your mom was in the house?

684
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:39,382
I've never told anyone that.
I'm sorry.

685
00:54:39,407 --> 00:54:41,702
You know we have talked about
this about a hundred times.

686
00:54:41,742 --> 00:54:44,992
You never mentioned that
your mom was in the house.

687
00:54:46,431 --> 00:54:48,382
I don't understand?
Why didn't you just tell me.

688
00:54:48,407 --> 00:54:53,384
Something that screwed up...
shapes everything.

689
00:54:53,411 --> 00:54:55,831
Who you are.

690
00:54:55,864 --> 00:54:58,681
How people see you.
It's not something that you bring up.

691
00:54:58,706 --> 00:55:02,121
It's something you pray people
don't find out about.

692
00:55:06,474 --> 00:55:07,782
So.

693
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:13,737
- Bryan, how did you find out?
- I do my homework, John.

694
00:55:14,204 --> 00:55:17,949
I had to do a whole lot of searching on the
internet to find out that the one survivor...

695
00:55:17,998 --> 00:55:22,349
Sarah Matthews had a son who...
wait for it.

696
00:55:22,914 --> 00:55:25,364
Whose name is John Mitchell.

697
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:27,981
So my mother was here, the
night of the murders. So what?

698
00:55:28,007 --> 00:55:29,143
Look.

699
00:55:29,168 --> 00:55:31,617
I understand why you wouldn't
want people to know about this.

700
00:55:31,643 --> 00:55:33,331
Alright, I do.

701
00:55:33,356 --> 00:55:38,449
But if it was her who brought you back here?
To communicate.

702
00:55:38,485 --> 00:55:44,362
And if you leave, you just gonna continue having
the same nightmares and visions of your mom.

703
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:49,474
Or you can stay.
Stay to have evocation.

704
00:55:50,371 --> 00:55:53,806
Find out what your mother
is trying to tell you.

705
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,434
I think she is in this house.

706
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,490
I think you know that.

707
00:56:03,867 --> 00:56:05,512
Stay.

708
00:56:10,782 --> 00:56:12,985
Hey, I think I got something here.

709
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:16,422
Wait. Is that a camera
inside the house?

710
00:56:17,277 --> 00:56:20,603
- Looks like a bunch of black.
- Just wait.

711
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,112
- Detective Lewis?
- Yup.

712
00:56:41,146 --> 00:56:46,119
Sir. We just got a report of a stolen
vehicle about a half mile up the road.

713
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:48,112
2000 red Dodge pickup.

714
00:56:48,137 --> 00:56:49,731
Why am I just hearing about it now?

715
00:56:49,755 --> 00:56:52,103
Owner didn't know it was stole
till he got in from work this morning.

716
00:56:52,128 --> 00:56:55,380
I want you to put out an APB
on a 2000 red dodge pickup.

717
00:56:55,427 --> 00:56:58,766
Anywhere inside a 300 miles radius.
Do you understand. Now!

718
00:57:52,704 --> 00:57:57,554
So tell me what happened during
this ritual, uh... the seance.

719
00:57:57,588 --> 00:58:05,588
They recited some passage from one of Jules' books.
That she said was used for communication.

720
00:58:07,146 --> 00:58:11,487
I just wanted some answers to this stuff
so that I can finally get some peace.

721
00:58:13,257 --> 00:58:16,657
Alright. Jules, you want to walk us through?
- Yeah.

722
00:58:20,052 --> 00:58:23,791
Okay. So there are a lot of theories
about how to open these gates.
.

723
00:58:24,188 --> 00:58:26,465
The idea is that there are essentially
these energy pockets...

724
00:58:26,489 --> 00:58:29,710
Where the air is thinner between
our world and the underworld.

725
00:58:31,342 --> 00:58:35,791
Trick is finding them.
So everybody join hands.

726
00:58:38,025 --> 00:58:41,663
And we're just going to communicate
with the spirits. We're not summoning.

727
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:44,552
And don't move and don't break the circle.

728
00:58:44,577 --> 00:58:48,025
Because if there is a spirit is present,
our sphere of energy would constrain it.

729
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:50,224
Does everyone understand.

730
00:58:53,536 --> 00:58:55,601
Okay.
Go ahead, Bryan.

731
00:59:00,684 --> 00:59:06,306
If there're any spirits are present.
Show yourself to us.

732
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:12,101
We mean you no harm or disruption.

733
00:59:12,623 --> 00:59:15,550
Just indicate your presence.

734
00:59:16,621 --> 00:59:19,454
Indicate your presence to us.

735
00:59:20,311 --> 00:59:24,293
Hear me now,
and indicate your presence

736
00:59:40,402 --> 00:59:43,221
It's working.
Everyone say calm.

737
00:59:48,592 --> 00:59:50,362
What is it?

738
00:59:53,994 --> 00:59:57,114
- Just don't move.
- What?

739
00:59:57,139 --> 01:00:00,335
- Don't do anything.
- Why not?

740
01:00:00,905 --> 01:00:02,440
Trust me.

741
01:00:10,541 --> 01:00:14,166
If there are spirits here.
Just tell us why you are here.

742
01:00:15,893 --> 01:00:18,838
- My stomach.
- What is it?

743
01:00:27,668 --> 01:00:31,260
- Is this suppose to happens?
- Just hold on and let it run its course.

744
01:00:31,317 --> 01:00:35,623
No, I can't.
I can't. I can't. I can't.

745
01:00:35,893 --> 01:00:38,740
- Whatever happens. Don't break the circle.
- What are you talking about. She's in pain.

746
01:00:38,869 --> 01:00:41,307
Let's go.
She's gonna unleash something.

747
01:00:41,844 --> 01:00:45,418
Put it. Put it back.
What do you mean don't know how?

748
01:00:45,443 --> 01:00:48,043
Michelle.
Don't...!

749
01:00:48,068 --> 01:00:50,106
Let Go.

750
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:59,594
- Mom?
- Let go, John.

751
01:01:00,306 --> 01:01:02,474
It's time to let go.

752
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:06,764
Let go.
Let go.

753
01:01:10,335 --> 01:01:12,021
No!

754
01:01:20,237 --> 01:01:21,673
Get to the car.

755
01:01:22,365 --> 01:01:23,800
Let's leave.

756
01:01:24,753 --> 01:01:28,563
- The door.
- What?

757
01:01:28,597 --> 01:01:30,038
And then what?

758
01:01:30,063 --> 01:01:32,422
Get me out of here, John.

759
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,985
I've lost her.
Michelle!

760
01:01:36,144 --> 01:01:39,992
I tried to find her, but it was dark.
And...

761
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:44,266
I can hear people yelling and screaming.

762
01:01:46,813 --> 01:01:49,175
And I just needed to find Michelle.

763
01:01:49,201 --> 01:01:51,030
Michelle!

764
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,416
Michelle!

765
01:02:02,527 --> 01:02:04,172
Bryan.

766
01:02:06,085 --> 01:02:09,603
Everyone must die.
Everyone must die.

767
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:14,568
- Bryan, you alright?
- Everyone must die.

768
01:02:15,143 --> 01:02:18,443
Everyone must die.

769
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:22,429
- Bryan?
- Everyone must die.

770
01:02:28,034 --> 01:02:30,641
So.
You're saying Bryan became possessed.

771
01:02:30,666 --> 01:02:32,175
Is that right?

772
01:02:48,889 --> 01:02:50,851
The killer is filming the murders.

773
01:02:50,876 --> 01:02:53,309
How is he holding the camera
while he's filming that?

774
01:02:53,532 --> 01:02:57,398
See those glasses on the table?
We found those where they did the ritual.

775
01:02:57,422 --> 01:03:00,054
Forensic, you still in the house?
- We're still here sir.

776
01:03:00,085 --> 01:03:03,199
I want to see exactly what those kids were
using during the seance. You understand.

777
01:03:03,224 --> 01:03:06,469
- I want it clearly marked and I want it in 15.
- Copy that.

778
01:03:06,594 --> 01:03:09,057
My name is Leonard Abbernacky.

779
01:03:09,762 --> 01:03:14,795
I lived just down the road. My wife
called me, she wanted me to.. check...

780
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:18,244
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Go back to Abbernacky footage.

781
01:03:20,943 --> 01:03:24,731
I got up to the porch
and there's some kind of noise.

782
01:03:24,755 --> 01:03:26,422
Some distance off it.

783
01:03:26,447 --> 01:03:28,773
- Crash.
- Car crash.

784
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:30,996
No. The hearing distance can't be
more than a few miles from here.

785
01:03:31,021 --> 01:03:33,023
Meaning. We search every road around here.

786
01:03:33,048 --> 01:03:35,217
That the front of the
house or back of the house?

787
01:03:35,567 --> 01:03:37,293
That is the front of the house.

788
01:03:37,318 --> 01:03:39,797
He ain't pointing at the road,
he's pointing at Jackson farm.

789
01:03:39,822 --> 01:03:41,288
Did you checked Jackson farm?

790
01:03:41,322 --> 01:03:43,913
- No sir, it's private property.
- Alright, I want you to get everybody.

791
01:03:43,938 --> 01:03:46,293
I want you to go down to Jackson farm.
I want you look for a red pickup truck.

792
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:49,760
There are lots roads and lots of swamps.
So get the dogs and spread out.

793
01:03:49,786 --> 01:03:50,780
Jackson, Frederick.

794
01:03:50,804 --> 01:03:52,387
Go back.
Go back again.

795
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:56,106
I got up to the porch
and there's some kind of noise.

796
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:57,994
Some distance off it.

797
01:03:59,355 --> 01:04:01,255
Let's say that I believe you.

798
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,375
That Bryan became
possessed or changed.

799
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,802
That still doesn't
make him a murderer.

800
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:08,387
I know.

801
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:11,728
So.
What happened next?

802
01:04:41,775 --> 01:04:44,347
Bryan Purcell was attacking
you with an axe?

803
01:04:44,371 --> 01:04:48,521
He was wearing these glasses with...
the tiny camera on them.

804
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:51,815
Are you telling me
it was Bryan Purcell?

805
01:04:52,001 --> 01:04:56,103
Yes, but it...
it wasn't him.

806
01:04:56,244 --> 01:04:59,418
Are you IDing Bryan Purcell?
That's all I need to know.

807
01:04:59,443 --> 01:05:02,498
I tell you he wasn't human.

808
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:04,155
I'll be right back.

809
01:05:06,878 --> 01:05:09,505
- That all of it?
- Yeah. This is all in front of the room.

810
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:11,099
Just in front of it.

811
01:05:11,123 --> 01:05:12,280
- Hey.
- Hey.

812
01:05:12,306 --> 01:05:13,809
He just ID Bryan Purcell.

813
01:05:13,835 --> 01:05:16,099
Said he attacked him with an axe
and then went after everyone else.

814
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:18,096
- Oh man. And he's sure?
- Yes, he's sure.

815
01:05:18,121 --> 01:05:18,469
Alright.

816
01:05:18,494 --> 01:05:20,496
Lewis. You better come down here.
We spotted something.

817
01:05:20,521 --> 01:05:22,117
On my way, on my way.

818
01:05:22,143 --> 01:05:24,552
Do me a favor. See if you
can make anything of this.

819
01:05:24,577 --> 01:05:25,641
Why me?

820
01:05:25,666 --> 01:05:28,978
Because you're a doctor.
And I was hoping you can read Latin.

821
01:05:31,471 --> 01:05:33,842
Can you get me gloves, please?

822
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:41,646
Bryan Purcell!

823
01:05:44,755 --> 01:05:45,952
Purcell.

824
01:05:46,119 --> 01:05:48,018
Mr. Purcell.
Can you hear us?

825
01:05:55,605 --> 01:05:59,088
Can you hear me?
I got a pulse.

826
01:05:59,112 --> 01:06:02,172
We've got a 20i.
About a mile north of LaForte Road.

827
01:06:02,197 --> 01:06:04,358
Victim is seriously injured.

828
01:06:04,389 --> 01:06:07,335
Stay with us buddy. Ambulance's on the way.
You'll be okay.

829
01:06:11,016 --> 01:06:13,248
Hey.
Do you know what this symbol is?

830
01:06:14,856 --> 01:06:17,106
I believe that is a circle.

831
01:06:20,864 --> 01:06:22,027
What are you doing?

832
01:06:22,052 --> 01:06:24,751
I'm doing research that already
should have been done.

833
01:06:24,777 --> 01:06:27,791
It is a circle painted on the ground.
Those kids are crazy.

834
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,755
I know... those kids are crazy.

835
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:33,237
But it makes sense to someone. And we're
trying to get into that someone's head.

836
01:06:33,273 --> 01:06:35,501
Can you get me a computer, please.

837
01:06:41,177 --> 01:06:43,498
Hey, Jenkins!
Hurry!

838
01:06:45,737 --> 01:06:46,869
Help!

839
01:06:46,894 --> 01:06:48,384
Reeves!

840
01:06:48,608 --> 01:06:49,927
Here!

841
01:06:50,494 --> 01:06:53,099
Reeves!
Hold on buddy.

842
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:56,313
Officer down. Suspect is on the foot.
Jesus.

843
01:06:57,766 --> 01:07:01,331
PICTURE PATTERN RECOGNITION

844
01:07:04,543 --> 01:07:06,740
Seal of the Left Hand Path.

845
01:07:17,822 --> 01:07:20,032
Holy shit.
Call the... call the cops.

846
01:07:25,215 --> 01:07:27,516
- I can't talk right now.
- Okay, just listen then.

847
01:07:27,541 --> 01:07:29,246
That Latin passage you wanted me to read.

848
01:07:29,271 --> 01:07:30,235
It's a seance.

849
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:32,887
It's a seance to communicate
with the other side.

850
01:07:32,913 --> 01:07:36,476
It says stuff like:
'Come to us. Make your presence known."

851
01:07:36,501 --> 01:07:38,260
It sounds kind of innocuous,
but then I digged...

852
01:07:38,286 --> 01:07:41,373
- Elizabeth. Elizabeth.
- Wait. The symbol in the living room...

853
01:07:41,398 --> 01:07:43,550
It's called "The seal
of the Left Hand Path."

854
01:07:43,576 --> 01:07:47,353
And it refers to certain places
as prisons that hold demons.

855
01:07:47,378 --> 01:07:50,094
- Oh, man. This is crazy.
- Hey listen.

856
01:07:50,118 --> 01:07:53,427
This isn't what I think.
This is what the research says.

857
01:07:53,453 --> 01:07:56,121
In order for a demon to be
released from a prison,

858
01:07:56,145 --> 01:07:58,475
everyone involved in the
seance has to die.

859
01:07:58,501 --> 01:08:01,118
And then it can leave
through a pure human soul.

860
01:08:01,152 --> 01:08:04,180
Alright. Tell me how this helps me?
How does this help me?

861
01:08:04,204 --> 01:08:06,502
We're trying to get
inside Bryan's head.

862
01:08:06,528 --> 01:08:10,837
And if Bryan thinks everyone has to die
for a demon to be released from the house.

863
01:08:10,863 --> 01:08:15,538
Then he's trying to kill everyone. He's
delusional and he's trying to kill everyone.

864
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:21,367
All available units, we have a possible
robbery in progress...

865
01:08:32,046 --> 01:08:33,600
We need to re-establish contact.

866
01:08:33,626 --> 01:08:35,434
I'm sorry that this is happening.
I shouldn't have left Reeves alone.

867
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:39,612
Listen to me. Re-establish communication. Let
them know Purcell is inside. You understand.

868
01:08:39,636 --> 01:08:42,743
Then get back to the crash site.
We need to find Michelle Chapman.

869
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:48,310
Bryan Purcell.
My name is Detective Lewis.

870
01:08:48,335 --> 01:08:51,172
And this doesn't need to go any further.
You understand me?

871
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:52,708
Bryan.

872
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:55,661
You still have time to explain yourself.

873
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:01,695
I want you to get your men ready. In case
this doesn't work. You understand me?

874
01:09:01,701 --> 01:09:03,052
Yes sir.

875
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,904
Help!

876
01:09:07,539 --> 01:09:10,832
- They found Bryan Purcell.
- What about Michelle?

877
01:09:10,856 --> 01:09:14,283
- No, no Michelle yet.
- He knows where she is.

878
01:09:14,307 --> 01:09:17,387
- You got to get her from him now.
- They will.

879
01:09:17,412 --> 01:09:20,350
I'm going to have one of my men
sent in walkie.

880
01:09:20,376 --> 01:09:24,680
They're going to come up to the door
and they're going to slide a walkie.

881
01:09:25,404 --> 01:09:27,000
Here it comes.

882
01:09:29,185 --> 01:09:31,497
Pick that up, Bryan.

883
01:09:34,536 --> 01:09:36,530
Pick it up, Bryan.

884
01:09:40,394 --> 01:09:43,555
Do this anyway you want to.
But you have to talk to me, Bryan.

885
01:09:43,581 --> 01:09:44,971
What the hell is Bryan doing?

886
01:09:44,997 --> 01:09:47,916
- He's stone walling.
- Wh... Michelle could be bleeding to death.

887
01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:50,753
John relax.
We're handling it, okay.

888
01:09:51,929 --> 01:09:53,725
- Tell us where she is at!
- John, stop!

889
01:09:53,751 --> 01:09:55,444
- Say something, Bryan!
- Stop!

890
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:56,889
- (Stop!)
- (Say something!)

891
01:09:56,913 --> 01:09:59,601
God Damn it, Klein.
You get him off that walkie.

892
01:09:59,981 --> 01:10:03,018
Tell us where she is!
Tell us where she is!

893
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:04,935
Bryan.

894
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,085
Say something!

895
01:10:07,109 --> 01:10:09,054
- ...thing inside of you. I'm just...
- John!

896
01:10:09,078 --> 01:10:10,385
Speak!

897
01:10:15,506 --> 01:10:16,962
Medic!

898
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:21,212
- What happening?
- He's having seizures.

899
01:10:21,774 --> 01:10:23,024
John.

900
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:25,917
What?

901
01:10:26,246 --> 01:10:28,817
Alright, talk to me.
What've you got.

902
01:10:34,951 --> 01:10:36,109
Bryan.

903
01:10:36,452 --> 01:10:39,198
Mark...
Mark, you need to stop Bryan.

904
01:10:42,555 --> 01:10:46,055
He's going into a cardiac arrest!
We need to get these cuffs off of him!

905
01:10:46,099 --> 01:10:48,520
Bryan is trying to kill John.

906
01:10:48,546 --> 01:10:50,609
Mark, do something!

907
01:10:54,298 --> 01:10:56,399
Do something!

908
01:11:15,474 --> 01:11:17,121
Check the clerk.

909
01:11:18,304 --> 01:11:20,939
Bryan.
Look at me son.

910
01:11:21,106 --> 01:11:22,884
Where is Michelle.

911
01:11:22,908 --> 01:11:25,090
Tell me where Michelle is.
Is she alive?

912
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,145
Is Michelle alive?

913
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:28,895
Heh, heh, heh...

914
01:11:29,636 --> 01:11:32,595
What'd you do?
Is she with God?

915
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:34,564
Is she with God?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

916
01:11:34,588 --> 01:11:37,453
Tell me if Michelle is alive.
Shake your head.

917
01:11:37,479 --> 01:11:39,331
Bryan!
Bryan!

918
01:11:39,472 --> 01:11:40,889
Bryan!

919
01:11:44,305 --> 01:11:46,189
Son of a bitch.

920
01:11:47,311 --> 01:11:50,849
You might want to look at this.
The reason he couldn't talk.

921
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:53,270
He's missing his tongue.

922
01:11:53,296 --> 01:11:55,238
Oh.
Jesus Christ.

923
01:11:59,787 --> 01:12:02,047
- What the hell happened back there?
- I don't know.

924
01:12:02,073 --> 01:12:04,606
But when Bryan started to go crazy.
John just lost it. And then.

925
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:06,904
I don't know how to say this.
But that guy just flew across the room.

926
01:12:06,929 --> 01:12:09,832
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not kidding. He flew across the room.

927
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:10,529
Jesus Christ.

928
01:12:10,554 --> 01:12:14,744
- Hey. You got to listen to me.
- I can't, I can't. I think Bryan told us where Michelle is.

929
01:12:15,323 --> 01:12:17,761
- Klein, you read?
- Go for Klein.

930
01:12:17,787 --> 01:12:20,626
Do you still want to see that
Sara Matthews footage?

931
01:12:49,636 --> 01:12:51,795
You son of a bitch.

932
01:12:57,141 --> 01:12:58,307
Michelle.

933
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:01,046
Jenkins, get a medic.
We got her.

934
01:13:01,072 --> 01:13:02,021
Damn it.

935
01:13:02,046 --> 01:13:05,658
Hey.
You're okay. You're okay.

936
01:13:06,377 --> 01:13:08,082
Alright.

937
01:13:09,988 --> 01:13:12,126
You're alright,
you're alright, you're alright.

938
01:13:12,302 --> 01:13:14,672
Okay. Okay.
You're doing okay.

939
01:13:14,698 --> 01:13:15,899
Medic!
Get a medic.

940
01:13:15,925 --> 01:13:18,132
Jenkins, I need help.
Get people up here.

941
01:13:20,226 --> 01:13:21,996
What've you got?

942
01:13:23,051 --> 01:13:25,979
Sara Matthews.
John's mother.

943
01:13:26,421 --> 01:13:29,560
Something happened with Martha
during the seance.

944
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:33,675
And then after.
She wasn't herself.

945
01:13:33,792 --> 01:13:38,341
She just kept...
saying that everyone had to die.

946
01:13:39,752 --> 01:13:42,462
Everyone had to die
so she could be free.

947
01:13:42,493 --> 01:13:44,145
Now look at this.

948
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:53,841
She's pregnant.
Baby okay?

949
01:13:53,867 --> 01:13:56,225
Too early to tell.
We have to get her to the unit.

950
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:59,206
- Wait, wait, wait...
- He's killed them.

951
01:13:59,230 --> 01:14:01,923
- What're you saying now?
- Same room.

952
01:14:01,948 --> 01:14:03,442
What room?

953
01:14:03,512 --> 01:14:04,917
- Same room.
- Same room.

954
01:14:04,952 --> 01:14:06,672
We have to get her to the ambulance.
- Okay. Go, go, go.

955
01:14:06,698 --> 01:14:07,954
Let's go.

956
01:14:11,319 --> 01:14:15,426
Officer.
Can you re-cuff the suspect, please.

957
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:17,400
What?

958
01:14:30,595 --> 01:14:34,176
- Stay close, I just need a minute alone with him.
- Sure thing.

959
01:14:35,728 --> 01:14:41,117
I heard them. Michelle alive.
She's going to make it, right?

960
01:14:41,554 --> 01:14:44,097
I don't know John.
Do you want her to make it?

961
01:14:44,792 --> 01:14:46,877
I like that very much.

962
01:14:47,798 --> 01:14:50,443
It was you.
It wasn't Bryan.

963
01:14:50,537 --> 01:14:54,216
Everyone must die. Everyone must die.
For me to live.

964
01:14:54,242 --> 01:14:56,872
You manipulated
this whole night.

965
01:14:56,965 --> 01:14:59,461
But it didn't work.
Because everyone didn't die.

966
01:14:59,485 --> 01:15:01,434
Michelle is still alive.

967
01:15:01,594 --> 01:15:06,271
So, is there anything you want to tell me before
you go to prison for the rest of your life.

968
01:15:06,728 --> 01:15:09,229
I'm not going to prison,
Elizabeth.

969
01:15:11,194 --> 01:15:12,802
I'm leaving it.

970
01:15:12,926 --> 01:15:16,016
Okay.
Maybe you didn't hear me.

971
01:15:16,051 --> 01:15:17,509
But, everybody didn't die.

972
01:15:17,533 --> 01:15:20,286
Your little ritual didn't work
because Michelle is still alive.

973
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:22,981
- And you're still alive.
- You're wrong.

974
01:15:25,663 --> 01:15:27,927
Jesus Christ.

975
01:15:29,829 --> 01:15:35,850
Everyone must die. Everyone must die.
Everyone must die for me to live.

976
01:15:35,956 --> 01:15:40,002
Everyone must die.
Everyone must die. Everyone must die.

977
01:15:43,813 --> 01:15:46,042
Everyone must die.

978
01:15:46,764 --> 01:15:51,734
Everyone must die.
Everyone must die for me to live.

979
01:16:24,021 --> 01:16:25,261
Klein.

980
01:16:25,287 --> 01:16:27,740
The ritual is working.

981
01:16:34,104 --> 01:16:36,005
Open the door.

982
01:16:39,659 --> 01:16:42,122
Open the god damn door!
Move!

983
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:51,117
John's mother was my vessel,
but she escaped.

984
01:16:51,152 --> 01:16:54,279
Now Michelle is my vessel.

985
01:16:54,653 --> 01:16:59,155
And once she crosses the seal,
I'll be free.

986
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:11,645
Elizabeth!

987
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:15,015
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth.

988
01:17:15,057 --> 01:17:18,149
That's okay. Alright. Alright.
You're okay. You're okay.

989
01:17:18,188 --> 01:17:19,880
He's gone.
He's gone.

990
01:17:19,904 --> 01:17:22,907
He disappeared. He disappeared.
It was him. It was John.

991
01:17:22,931 --> 01:17:24,487
He killed all of them.

992
01:17:24,511 --> 01:17:26,956
And I know you're not going to believe me.
He became possessed.

993
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:31,033
He's dead. He's in the house.
So I know he's dead. He's hung himself.

994
01:17:31,069 --> 01:17:32,923
- He's in the house and he's hung himself.
- No, no, no...

995
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:34,694
- He's dead and I'm telling you I just saw it.
- No, no, no...

996
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:36,528
I just saw it.

997
01:17:37,681 --> 01:17:39,505
He was just sitting there...

998
01:17:39,539 --> 01:17:41,860
and I started choking.

999
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:43,476
Look!
Look at it!

1000
01:17:43,502 --> 01:17:45,421
Look at this.
Look.

1001
01:17:45,725 --> 01:17:48,664
See.
See.

1002
01:17:50,685 --> 01:17:52,145
I don't understand.

1003
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:55,260
You guys came all the way down here
to document a haunted house...

1004
01:17:55,284 --> 01:18:00,430
And then there's no documentation. Nothing
to show what happened in that house.

1005
01:18:00,456 --> 01:18:02,279
Can you explain that?

1006
01:18:02,305 --> 01:18:04,621
How do you explain that?

1007
01:18:04,918 --> 01:18:06,287
I can't.

1008
01:18:06,613 --> 01:18:08,152
I can't

1009
01:18:20,011 --> 01:18:21,720
I just...

1010
01:18:21,947 --> 01:18:23,706
I just felt it kick.

1011
01:18:23,730 --> 01:18:25,587
Is this the first one.

1012
01:18:28,972 --> 01:18:32,457
Just gonna get a quick listen
to your baby, alright.

1013
01:18:44,610 --> 01:18:46,117
Okay.

1014
01:18:46,942 --> 01:18:51,032
You don't have anything to worry about.
Your baby is going to be just fine.
