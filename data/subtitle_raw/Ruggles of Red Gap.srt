1
00:01:09,168 --> 00:01:11,044
Ten o'clock, my lord.

2
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:15,105
- Oh, what's that?
- Ten o'clock, my lord.

3
00:01:15,758 --> 00:01:18,092
Anything wrong, my lord?

4
00:01:18,218 --> 00:01:20,595
Everything's wrong.

5
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:24,474
- Shellfish again for supper, my lord?
- Mm, what of it?

6
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:27,769
You know what they do to
your digestion, my lord.

7
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,271
They don't do a
thing to my digestion.

8
00:01:30,272 --> 00:01:32,106
- No, my lord?
- No.

9
00:01:32,107 --> 00:01:37,487
If you want to know, I had oysters
and lobsters and sherry and champagne.

10
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:38,988
Quite, my lord.

11
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:43,868
I had dinner and spent the
evening with Sr. and Sra. Floud.

12
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:46,829
- The Americans, my lord?
- Yes.

13
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:52,627
They taught me their native
game of, um... drawing poker.

14
00:01:52,753 --> 00:01:57,653
- Quite a 'orrible experience, my lord.
- Yes, it was.

15
00:01:58,884 --> 00:02:01,552
I am putting out your
light grey, my lord.

16
00:02:01,553 --> 00:02:04,680
There is something in
the air this morning

17
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:09,102
- which calls for light grey, I think.
- Mm, possibly.

18
00:02:09,103 --> 00:02:11,938
- What's all this mess?
- I'm packin' up.

19
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:15,900
We're goin' home, Effie. I can be
pushed just so far and no further.

20
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:19,987
Egbert, get dressed. I'm sending
you over to fetch Ruggles.

21
00:02:19,988 --> 00:02:22,865
Now look-a-here! I ain't
gonna have no English valet.

22
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:24,534
- Oh, yes, you are.
- No, I ain't.

23
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:27,829
I got about as much use for one of
them as a pig has for side pockets.

24
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,332
I'm going to turn you into
a gentleman if it kills me.

25
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:35,586
Well, you can't do it by hirin' a
man to give me a bath and dress me.

26
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:39,340
I can button myself up.
I been doin' it for years.

27
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:43,219
You don't seem to realise what
this would mean to us socially.

28
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,055
- How? How socially?
- Why, in Red Gap.

29
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:50,309
It will give us, er...
tone, joie de vivre.

30
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:51,978
What's that?

31
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:55,982
It... um... er... tone.

32
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:58,359
To have him there.

33
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:00,111
Havin' who?

34
00:03:00,237 --> 00:03:03,281
Effie, you ain't aimin' on
taking Ruggles to Red Gap?

35
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:07,702
I certainly am. Egbert,
get your clothes on.

36
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:12,165
Now look-a-here, Effie. I can be
pushed just so far and no further.

37
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,376
Egbert. Get your clothes on.

38
00:03:15,502 --> 00:03:17,002
Well, why? Why?

39
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:19,881
Uh... why?

40
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,550
Ruggles, how are you
about, er... shocks?

41
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:31,434
- Shocks, my lord?
- Yes, you know, shocks. Upheavals.

42
00:03:31,435 --> 00:03:35,438
Er... you've always stood up under
them pretty well, haven't you?

43
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,316
- I trust I have, my lord.
- Yes, I remember.

44
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:40,776
You... you were very firm
with that Spanish girl.

45
00:03:40,777 --> 00:03:43,571
- She was a dancer, wasn't she?
- Quite so, my lord.

46
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:47,283
Yes, unaccountable number
of Spanish dancers in Madrid.

47
00:03:47,284 --> 00:03:49,493
Rather more than in most
places we've been, my lord.

48
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:51,871
- Ah, yes.
- Rather a pippin, wasn't she?

49
00:03:51,872 --> 00:03:54,874
- Oh, rather, yes.
- Prettier than the typist person.

50
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,042
Oh, much, yes.

51
00:03:56,043 --> 00:04:00,463
Yes, I nearly chucked everything and
went to... went to America with her.

52
00:04:00,464 --> 00:04:02,089
America would never
do for you, my lord.

53
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,968
I don't know. A lot of opportunities
over there, the right kind of fellow.

54
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:10,598
I... You'll do very well for
yourself there, I think, Ruggles.

55
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,767
Me, my lord?

56
00:04:12,893 --> 00:04:18,648
Oh, yes. Yes, I forgot to tell you.
You're... you're going out to America.

57
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,608
America, my lord?

58
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:24,195
A country of slavery.

59
00:04:24,196 --> 00:04:26,155
Oh, that's all
finished, I believe.

60
00:04:26,156 --> 00:04:28,950
Some fellow called
Pocahontas or something

61
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:31,202
did something about
it or... or other.

62
00:04:31,203 --> 00:04:33,746
- Indeed, my lord?
- Mm.

63
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:36,582
Would it be North or
South America, my lord?

64
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,085
Oh. Oh, North, I think it is.
Somewhere on the West Coast.

65
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:43,116
Idaho or Omaha, one
of those Indian places.

66
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:47,093
- The chap's a sort of a millionaire.
- The chap, my lord?

67
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:50,554
Yes, plenty of money,
you know. Mines, lumber,

68
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:53,975
domestic animals and
that sort of thing.

69
00:04:53,976 --> 00:04:59,626
His wife took quite a fancy
to you and, er... so they've...

70
00:04:59,898 --> 00:05:01,732
won you.

71
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:05,403
- Won me, my lord?
- Oh, yes.

72
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:09,448
Yes, yes. We were playing this
game of drawing poker, you see.

73
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,575
It seems there's a
thing called bluffing

74
00:05:11,576 --> 00:05:14,954
and, though I say it myself,
I'm particularly good at it.

75
00:05:14,955 --> 00:05:17,206
Do I understand...

76
00:05:17,332 --> 00:05:20,001
that I was the
stake, my lord?

77
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:21,836
Oh, yes, yes. Rather, yes.

78
00:05:21,837 --> 00:05:26,340
Ha-ha. Yes. You see, I didn't
realise that they were bluffing too.

79
00:05:26,341 --> 00:05:32,221
I... I had three of the eights
against a flush of clubs.

80
00:05:32,347 --> 00:05:34,056
So, you really only
lost by one eight.

81
00:05:34,057 --> 00:05:36,183
- Indeed, my lord?
- Oh, yes.

82
00:05:36,184 --> 00:05:43,944
I do hope you don't think I didn't lose
you gamely as a gentleman should, Ruggles.

83
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:47,069
North America, my lord.

84
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:49,739
Quite an untamed
country, I understand.

85
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,930
Yes, I expect so, yes.

86
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:58,831
Oh, yes, that must be Sr. Floud
come to collect you, Ruggles.

87
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,709
Yes.

88
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,054
Yes, thank you, Ruggles.

89
00:06:26,735 --> 00:06:28,527
Come in, sir.

90
00:06:28,653 --> 00:06:31,280
Well, how are
you, Sr. Ruggles?

91
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:33,324
Well, how do?

92
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:36,660
Er... good morning, sir.
Won't you be seated, sir?

93
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:38,662
Yeah, thanks.

94
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:44,168
Now, er... now
look-a-here, Sr. Ruggles.

95
00:06:44,294 --> 00:06:48,005
I want you to understand that this
wasn't my ideia at all, you know.

96
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:50,257
- This was Effie's.
- So I understand, sir.

97
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:53,302
Yes, sir, when she gets
her mind set on something,

98
00:06:53,303 --> 00:06:55,429
she's a wildcat, believe me.

99
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,973
I have no reason
to doubt you, sir.

100
00:06:57,974 --> 00:07:01,477
- Well, well, you old tarantula!
- Oh.

101
00:07:01,603 --> 00:07:04,105
- Well, how... how you coming?
- Hello, hello, hello, hello.

102
00:07:04,106 --> 00:07:06,941
I... I guess you know
what I'm here for.

103
00:07:06,942 --> 00:07:08,067
Yes, I do, yes.

104
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:10,694
Well, I ain't any more
joyouser about it than you are.

105
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:13,364
But... but you
know Effie. Hm.

106
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:16,283
I tell you, when she gets riled
up, she'd fight a rattlesnake

107
00:07:16,284 --> 00:07:19,444
and give it the
first two bites.

108
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:24,625
I fancy you'll find
Ruggles fairish enough.

109
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:30,005
Oh, that's all right, Earl.
Your word's good enough for me.

110
00:07:30,006 --> 00:07:34,176
Er... well, I don't want to hurry you
there, Bill, but you'd better pack your grip.

111
00:07:34,177 --> 00:07:36,178
- Pack my grip, sir?
- Yeah.

112
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:38,806
Oh, hold on. Wait a minute. You
ain't got time. Effie's in a hurry.

113
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:41,517
You'd better check in first and
then pick up your duds later, see?

114
00:07:41,518 --> 00:07:43,519
Very good, sir.

115
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:01,328
Is there anything further
I can do for you, my lord?

116
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:03,729
I fancy not, Ruggles, no.

117
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,209
This is rather
sudden, isn't it?

118
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,881
Well, bound to be sudden, you
know, a thing like this, I mean.

119
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:14,758
I can't help worrying about
what will happen to you, my lord.

120
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,678
Oh, Ruggles, don't.
I'll be all right.

121
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:21,399
Be rather fun dressing
myself, I expect.

122
00:08:23,435 --> 00:08:25,436
I hope you will
enjoy it, my lord.

123
00:08:25,437 --> 00:08:27,730
Oh, of course I shall.

124
00:08:27,856 --> 00:08:30,441
- Your digestive tablets.
- Oh, yes.

125
00:08:30,442 --> 00:08:31,984
You ought to take your two.

126
00:08:31,985 --> 00:08:35,225
Yes, well... well,
goodbye, Ruggles.

127
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:39,825
And look after yourself
and all that sort of thing.

128
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:44,330
- Yes, my lord. Thank you, my lord.
- Oh, don't thank me.

129
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:48,671
- I ought to thank you, really.
- No, my lord.

130
00:08:55,425 --> 00:08:57,176
I am ready, sir.

131
00:08:57,302 --> 00:09:00,346
Eh? Oh, yes, yes, sure.

132
00:09:02,432 --> 00:09:05,272
It's kind of sad, ain't it?

133
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:10,439
Well, so long, Earl.
Keep your head up.

134
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,441
Goodbye, Floud.

135
00:09:13,777 --> 00:09:15,569
Thank you.

136
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,241
Goodbye, my lord.

137
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:24,495
He has the worst taste
of any man I ever knew.

138
00:09:24,496 --> 00:09:26,413
- To the cleaner, madame?
- To the cleaner?

139
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:28,415
I want the whole lot
taken out and burned.

140
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,834
- Burned, madame?
- Burned to ashes.

141
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:33,170
- And then burn the ashes.
- Oui, madame.

142
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:36,549
My husband is to have
an entirely new outfit.

143
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,260
Er... will you look at that?

144
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:43,055
He liked that so well,
he bought two of them.

145
00:09:43,056 --> 00:09:46,356
Even the moths
wouldn't eat those.

146
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,530
Come on, Bill, come on,
come on. Stir your stumps.

147
00:09:52,691 --> 00:09:56,360
Hey, hey, hey! Where you
going with my clothes?

148
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:59,613
Well, maybe... maybe she's
gonna get 'em pressed.

149
00:09:59,614 --> 00:10:02,408
Well, this is the place.
Here we go. Here...

150
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:04,569
Where are you? Where...

151
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:06,996
- Well, go ahead in.
- After you, sir.

152
00:10:06,997 --> 00:10:09,039
- Well, go on, go on.
- Oh, no, sir.

153
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,167
Er... you're too
darned polite.

154
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:15,337
Effie! Effie!

155
00:10:15,463 --> 00:10:19,216
Come on in, Bill. Make
yourself at home. Effie!

156
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:21,677
Er... we got company.

157
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:25,931
Well, Ruggles, here you are.

158
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:27,933
Oh, I'm so
delighted I got you.

159
00:10:27,934 --> 00:10:30,769
I've had my eye on you ever
since I met His Lordship.

160
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,357
I do hope and trust you're going to like
it with us, both here and in Red Gap.

161
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:36,858
Red Gap, madam?

162
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:40,070
Er... yes, our home town, you
know, in the state of Washington.

163
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:43,657
It's a little, er...
bourgeoisie, I'm afraid,

164
00:10:43,658 --> 00:10:47,494
but I think you'll find a few of us who
still really care about what's happening

165
00:10:47,495 --> 00:10:49,895
in the, er... haut monde.

166
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:51,540
Ah, indubitably, madam.

167
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,459
Oh, what beautiful
French you speak, Ruggles.

168
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,710
- Effie!
- Yes?

169
00:10:54,711 --> 00:10:57,588
Effie, what's that hired
girl gonna do with my clothes?

170
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:58,839
Never mind.

171
00:10:58,965 --> 00:11:01,550
Now, Ruggles, the first thing we
have to do is take Sr. Floud out

172
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:03,761
and get him a
whole new outfit.

173
00:11:03,762 --> 00:11:06,180
Now, what for? Now, what's
the matter with my clothes?

174
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:08,349
They're all right. Bill
said so, didn't you, Bill?

175
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,267
Er... Egbert.

176
00:11:10,393 --> 00:11:13,228
I let him dress himself according
to his own taste today...

177
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:15,606
and you see what
he looks like.

178
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:18,609
Do you think we can do
anything about him, Ruggles?

179
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,528
I dare say he could be
smartened up a bit, madam.

180
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:24,281
Well, I'll dare say more than that.
I can be pushed just so far and...

181
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:26,533
Egbert, you listen to me.

182
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:30,245
Look at his tie.
You see what I mean?

183
00:11:30,372 --> 00:11:33,415
His appearance is so disgraceful,
I... I hate to take him any place.

184
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,084
Yeah, you ought to see
some of the places she...

185
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:39,254
Egbert, you'll do as
you're told. Come along.

186
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:41,006
Your hat, sir.

187
00:11:45,887 --> 00:11:49,014
Now, you see what I meant about the
wildcat and rattlesnake, don't you?

188
00:11:49,015 --> 00:11:50,974
Look here, now, you go easy
on this clothes business

189
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:53,852
- and remember I like checks.
- Egbert.

190
00:11:53,853 --> 00:11:55,646
- Go ahead.
- After you, sir.

191
00:11:55,647 --> 00:11:57,648
- No, no. Go on, go on.
- Oh, no, no, sir.

192
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:01,709
What, are we gonna do
this all over again?

193
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:05,823
Madame, what, er... what
can I do for you today?

194
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:08,450
We want a lot of things
for the gentleman.

195
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:12,913
- Ah, for the gentleman?
- This is the gentleman.

196
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,331
Ah.

197
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:19,086
Oh, something... something
similar to what he's wearing?

198
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:22,840
Similar to... What is
this, a second-hand store?

199
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:23,966
Oh, no, madame!

200
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:29,012
You see, he got these clothes under
the most peculiar circumstances.

201
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:32,891
You see, he... Mm.

202
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:37,980
The gentleman's present condition
is purely the result of an accident.

203
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:41,775
The gentleman's hotel
burned down during the night.

204
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:46,697
The gentleman rushed from the burning
building in, er... the altogether.

205
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:48,782
Wait, wait, wait!
What is all this?

206
00:12:48,783 --> 00:12:52,911
The gentleman was forced to accept
the loan of garments from onlookers.

207
00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:54,913
All circus people!

208
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:02,329
Now I understand the gentleman's
ridiculous appearance!

209
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:05,132
Well, you... you ain't
no geranium yourself.

210
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:06,341
Egbert.

211
00:13:06,468 --> 00:13:09,428
Would you be kind enough to show
us something in morning coats?

212
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:13,499
Morning coats? Mais
oui, monsieur. Un moment.

213
00:13:14,642 --> 00:13:17,227
Try to walk, Egbert.

214
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:25,944
What do you think
of him, Ruggles?

215
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:29,905
In the main, madam,
I am not dissatisfied.

216
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:34,870
I think he looks
very distingué.

217
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:38,123
Gay nothing. I look like that bantam
rooster I had before it was run over.

218
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:39,666
When you came in here,

219
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:42,002
you looked like that bantam
rooster after he was run over.

220
00:13:42,003 --> 00:13:43,587
Voilà, monsieur, the spats!

221
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:48,592
Oh, now, look-a-here, Bill! Now, I
don't have to wear them things, do I?

222
00:13:48,593 --> 00:13:50,594
Spats, sir, mark
the difference

223
00:13:50,595 --> 00:13:54,431
between a man well turned
out and a man merely dressed.

224
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:57,017
Now, Egbert, go over and sit
down and be well turned out.

225
00:13:57,018 --> 00:13:59,561
No, sir, I won't wear
'em. I won't wear 'em.

226
00:13:59,562 --> 00:14:01,522
They'll make me look like
my drawers were hanging down.

227
00:14:01,523 --> 00:14:02,648
- Monsieur!
- No, sir.

228
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:04,858
I can be pushed just
so far and no further!

229
00:14:04,859 --> 00:14:07,486
- Monsieur! Un moment!
- Egbert! Egbert!

230
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:10,447
Ruggles, Ruggles,
go... go catch him!

231
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:12,407
Oh, dear!

232
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:21,124
Why, Egbert, you look
like a different man!

233
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:24,503
Yeah, maybe I'd
better change my name.

234
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:27,005
Here, here, here, here!
What are you gonna do now?

235
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:30,676
- We're... we're going to trim it.
- Oh, no, you won't!

236
00:14:30,677 --> 00:14:33,011
But, Egbert, it doesn't
go with the spats.

237
00:14:33,012 --> 00:14:36,807
I don't care. That moustache is
gonna stay just the way it is.

238
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:38,141
What would the
fellows say in Red Gap,

239
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:40,769
if they saw me come home
with a cut moustache?

240
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,522
No, sir, you
don't go and get...

241
00:14:43,523 --> 00:14:46,733
All right, all right, you can chew
the rag about it as much as you want.

242
00:14:46,734 --> 00:14:48,819
I ain't gonna let you do it.

243
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,737
It took me 20 years to
build up this moustache

244
00:14:50,738 --> 00:14:53,282
and I ain't gonna have
nobody monkey with it now.

245
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:55,868
Oh, Egbert!

246
00:14:55,994 --> 00:14:58,495
Oh, Effie!

247
00:14:58,621 --> 00:15:00,914
- Hm.
- Oh, madam!

248
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,333
Gah!

249
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:06,044
Oh, Bill!

250
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,255
Effie, I wouldn't
do that to a dog.

251
00:15:08,256 --> 00:15:10,716
Look, Egbert, isn't it nice?

252
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:14,428
- How do you like it, monsieur?
- Well, I don't know. Let me see.

253
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:16,221
How would you like it?

254
00:15:16,222 --> 00:15:18,724
Monsieur!

255
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:23,729
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home.

256
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,106
I'm gonna find myself a closet
so that I can hide in it.

257
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:28,901
Oh, no, you're not.
You're going with Ruggles.

258
00:15:28,902 --> 00:15:30,944
Now, come along. Come
on, get out there.

259
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:33,280
I wish you'd make
up your mind, Effie.

260
00:15:33,281 --> 00:15:34,615
Oh, Ruggles?

261
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:39,494
While I do some shopping, you might
spend a few hours with Egbert...

262
00:15:39,495 --> 00:15:42,581
I mean Sr. Floud,
in the art galleries.

263
00:15:42,582 --> 00:15:45,584
Art galleries? Yes, madam.

264
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,963
Yes, he's been writing down a few of
his impressions in this little book.

265
00:15:49,964 --> 00:15:53,967
Art, it seems, is
Egbert's emotional outlet.

266
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:56,136
Get him home early, Ruggles.

267
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:58,430
We have a few very important
people coming in for dinner.

268
00:15:58,431 --> 00:16:02,184
And see that he acts like a
gentleman, if you have to hog-tie him.

269
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:04,770
Place Vendôme!

270
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:08,486
Er... goodbye...
goodbye, Effie. Goodbye.

271
00:16:10,026 --> 00:16:14,363
We have a common sympathy in the
pictorial arts, if I may say so, sir.

272
00:16:14,364 --> 00:16:17,532
- Mm-hm? - Shall we
stroll towards the Louvre?

273
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:20,953
Wait a minute. She'll be
around the corner in a minute.

274
00:16:20,954 --> 00:16:22,162
Now.

275
00:16:27,794 --> 00:16:29,002
Come on, let's grab a table.

276
00:16:29,003 --> 00:16:31,296
Madam instructed me to conduct
you to the art galleries, sir.

277
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:34,800
Well... well, you wouldn't know
it, but this is it. Come on.

278
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:36,885
- Hey, Max! Oh, Max?
- Oui, monsieur.

279
00:16:36,886 --> 00:16:39,596
- Max, bring me my book, you know...
- Oui, monsieur.

280
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:43,100
They keep my book
handy here for me.

281
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:45,310
- I... I got a system.
- Oh!

282
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,897
Oh, monsieur, qu'il est
grand! Quelle surprise!

283
00:16:48,898 --> 00:16:50,774
Yeah, yeah, they tricked me.

284
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:52,609
- That's it, Max, now, give me a pencil.
- Oui, monsieur.

285
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,778
- And give us a couple of beers.
- Oui, monsieur, oui, oui.

286
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:56,446
Now, here's what
I do, Bill, see?

287
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:59,533
I copy out of this here big
book into this here little one,

288
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:05,122
and then I show Effie how much
I learned at the art galleries.

289
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:08,458
Yes, sir, but I fail to see how you
are to acquire culture in this way, sir.

290
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,628
Well, I don't know. I been getting
away with it ever since I come to Paris.

291
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:15,340
Now, look, you write it this time and
that'll make it stronger with Effie, see?

292
00:17:15,341 --> 00:17:18,176
And pick out something good,
something in the middle there,

293
00:17:18,177 --> 00:17:24,047
about, "Here lies the true lovers
of art entranced" or something.

294
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,476
Here is displayed in
its full flower, sir...

295
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:28,895
Well, sit down, sit down.
You can't write standing up.

296
00:17:28,896 --> 00:17:30,856
- Sit down.
- Oh, no, sir.

297
00:17:30,857 --> 00:17:34,776
Oh. Oh, I know what's
the matter with you.

298
00:17:34,777 --> 00:17:37,904
You think I'm mad at you on account
of these clothes and everything, hein?

299
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:39,531
Well, I ain't.

300
00:17:39,657 --> 00:17:43,660
I may be a little mad at Effie, but I
ain't mad at you. Now, go on, sit down.

301
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:46,496
There is a certain difference
in our walks of life, sir,

302
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:49,666
which makes it impossible for me to sit
at the same table with yourself, sir.

303
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:51,668
Well, you ain't ashamed
to sit here, are you?

304
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:53,295
Ashamed? It isn't that, sir.

305
00:17:53,296 --> 00:17:56,214
It just doesn't do for a gentleman's
servant to sit with his superiors, sir.

306
00:17:56,215 --> 00:18:00,052
Superiors, nothing. You're as good as I
am, and I'm as good as you are, ain't I?

307
00:18:00,053 --> 00:18:02,512
- Well, sir...
- Well, ain't I?

308
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:04,347
Er... yes, sir.

309
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:11,444
Well, then, what's eatin' you? Sit
down and take the weight off your shoes.

310
00:18:17,862 --> 00:18:23,202
There. There you are, you
see? That didn't hurt, did it?

311
00:18:23,826 --> 00:18:26,536
Mm. Mac, that's just what
we've been waiting for.

312
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:28,455
Aha!

313
00:18:28,581 --> 00:18:33,821
Well, here you go, Colonel.
Here's, er... spying on you.

314
00:18:35,004 --> 00:18:37,923
Well, ain't you
gonna drink with me?

315
00:18:37,924 --> 00:18:41,551
What's the matter with you?
Don't you ever have no fun?

316
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:43,428
Ain't you happy?

317
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:47,195
Well, don't you ever smile?

318
00:18:50,228 --> 00:18:53,271
Well, that ain't much of a
smile. Don't you feel good?

319
00:18:53,272 --> 00:18:54,898
I'm in perfect health, sir,

320
00:18:54,899 --> 00:18:58,693
but it is rather a shock to find oneself
breaking the tradition of generations.

321
00:18:58,694 --> 00:19:01,488
Well, don't let it throw
you, Colonel. Come on.

322
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:04,658
Excuse me, sir, but you must remember
to address me as Ruggles, sir,

323
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:08,954
and not as Colonel or as Bill or as
Sr. Ruggles, as you've been doing, sir.

324
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:12,374
Now, why? Why can't
I call you Colonel?

325
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,502
If we were overheard, sir,
people might take us to be equals.

326
00:19:15,503 --> 00:19:18,964
Well, listen. Where I come
from, everybody is equal, see?

327
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:22,092
Ah, that may be all very
well for America, sir,

328
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:25,428
but it would
never do with us.

329
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:28,807
Well, let's not get into no more
argument about it. We got work to do.

330
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:30,892
And then we can settle
down to some real drinking.

331
00:19:30,893 --> 00:19:34,053
Where was we in
that book there?

332
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:42,279
"Here is displayed in its full
flower", sir, "that ruthless realism

333
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,616
"happily alternated by a
superbly subtle delicacy..."

334
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:49,017
Wait a minute! Hey, Jeff!

335
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:52,664
- Hey, Jeff!
- Hold her, Newt!

336
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,500
Hey, Jeff Tuttle!

337
00:19:57,461 --> 00:20:00,422
Yee-hoo!

338
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:05,802
You old Sourdough!

339
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:27,949
Giddy-up! Now whoa!
Whoa, whoa, you old...

340
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,577
Whoa, my old...

341
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:35,123
No, wait a minute. I want you
to meet a friend of mine, Bill!

342
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:39,085
Er... hey, Bill!
Bill, where are you?

343
00:20:39,212 --> 00:20:41,213
Er... hey, Bill!

344
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:47,809
Come on down here! I
want you to meet somebody!

345
00:20:48,554 --> 00:20:50,222
Come on, Bill, come on!

346
00:20:50,223 --> 00:20:53,433
You know, I thought maybe you wouldn't
recognise me in my new beadwork here.

347
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:55,769
Me not know you,
you old Sourdough?

348
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,438
You old longhorn, you!

349
00:20:58,564 --> 00:21:01,066
Oh, Colonel Ruggles, I want
you to meet up with Jeff Tuttle

350
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:03,318
from Red Gap, State
of Washington, USA.

351
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:05,237
Pleased to meet
you, Colonel.

352
00:21:05,238 --> 00:21:07,656
I have no military
title whatsoever, sir,

353
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:10,617
never having served in His Majesty's
forces, not even in the ranks.

354
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:13,036
Any friend of Sourdough's
is all right with me.

355
00:21:13,037 --> 00:21:16,164
Say, what's the matter
with sitting down?

356
00:21:16,165 --> 00:21:19,459
Why, sure, sure. Pull up a chair
there, Colonel, pull up a chair.

357
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,378
No, pull up one
for yourself.

358
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:23,672
- Where did you get this?
- Yeah, well, Effie done that to me.

359
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:25,715
Wait till I show it
to you. Look at that.

360
00:21:25,716 --> 00:21:27,596
Big Chief High Hat!

361
00:21:31,013 --> 00:21:33,306
Here you are, Colonel,
shove those somewhere.

362
00:21:33,307 --> 00:21:37,060
Well, you old stinging lizard,
where did you turn up from?

363
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:41,314
Europe. We been all
over Europe and Italy.

364
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,859
Cathedrals. Just one
church after another.

365
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,404
And say! How about
a little drink?

366
00:21:47,405 --> 00:21:51,283
Ha! Well, beer's the only thing I know
how to say in these here French joints.

367
00:21:51,284 --> 00:21:54,619
- You leave that to me. Here, boy!
- Oui, monsieur?

368
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,579
Veesky soda.

369
00:21:57,957 --> 00:22:00,083
That's French for highball.

370
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:04,587
You have to do that... Well,
how did you ever learn that?

371
00:22:04,588 --> 00:22:07,382
Well, it took me some
time to get the accent.

372
00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:09,175
I think we ought to be
getting along home, sir.

373
00:22:09,176 --> 00:22:13,054
Hey, wait a minute! We
just met. Squattéz-vous.

374
00:22:13,055 --> 00:22:14,889
We have important people
coming to dinner, sir,

375
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,933
and we have definite
instructions from Madam.

376
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:19,686
Yeah, he means Effie.
You know how she is.

377
00:22:19,687 --> 00:22:25,108
- That woman could bite through nails.
- Yes, she chews 'em instead of gum.

378
00:22:25,109 --> 00:22:27,319
Here you go, Maxie, that's
what we been waitin' for.

379
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,822
Now bring three more,
er... veesky soda.

00:22:30,823 --> 00:22:32,657

- Oui, monsieur.

381
00:22:32,658 --> 00:22:35,201
Yeah, he got me right away.
Let's make it harder next time.

382
00:22:35,202 --> 00:22:39,039
You old mustang!
You old coyote!

383
00:22:39,165 --> 00:22:40,623
Here's looking at you!

384
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:44,627
Come on, come on, Colonel. Wrap
your paw around that there glass.

385
00:22:44,628 --> 00:22:46,963
- Yahoo!
- Yippee!

386
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:57,349
You old horned toad.

387
00:22:57,475 --> 00:23:00,810
- You old maverick.
- Ha-ha-ha-ha.

388
00:23:00,936 --> 00:23:02,812
Yippee!

389
00:23:02,938 --> 00:23:06,232
- What's the matter with a little grub?
- Yeah, a little grub.

390
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:08,818
Hey, George. Er... Max.

391
00:23:08,944 --> 00:23:10,653
Allé restaurant.

392
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:15,410
Ask him if he's got
some ham and eggs.

393
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:20,497
Er... voulez-vous...
er... hammy eggie?

394
00:23:20,623 --> 00:23:22,582
Qu'est-ce que
c'est, monsieur?

395
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:25,835
The man don't even
know his own language.

396
00:23:25,836 --> 00:23:27,962
Hammy eggie?

397
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:31,216
Gee, that's beautiful
French, beautiful French.

398
00:23:31,217 --> 00:23:33,927
And after that we'll
take a little drive

399
00:23:33,928 --> 00:23:36,304
to some of the well-known
points of interest.

400
00:23:36,305 --> 00:23:39,849
- Sure, sure, but no art galleries.
- And no churches.

401
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,852
No, and no clothing stores.

402
00:23:42,978 --> 00:23:45,063
And no churches.

403
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:47,857
And... You said that before.

404
00:23:50,277 --> 00:23:54,957
I wonder what we'll get
instead of ham and eggs.

405
00:23:58,285 --> 00:24:00,870
Yahoo!

406
00:24:15,594 --> 00:24:18,721
Well, by crikey, I didn't
know he had it in him!

407
00:24:18,722 --> 00:24:21,182
You should never let him
get in this condition.

408
00:24:21,183 --> 00:24:23,268
Why, the man's pickled!

409
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:27,188
Oh, it always affects him
this way. It's terrible.

410
00:24:27,189 --> 00:24:28,481
I beg your pardon, sir.

411
00:24:28,482 --> 00:24:31,067
- Look out, Jeff, grab him!
- I got him, I got him!

412
00:24:31,068 --> 00:24:33,987
He's a tough hombre
when he gets started.

413
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:35,488
Yippee! Yippee!
Yippee! Yippee!

414
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:38,408
You see there? You see?
There he goes again.

415
00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:41,494
We gotta get him out in the fresh
air. It's too hot for him in here.

416
00:24:41,495 --> 00:24:43,204
You go pay the cheque,
Jeff. I'll grab him.

417
00:24:43,205 --> 00:24:45,123
- Oui.
- I'll grab him, I'll grab him.

418
00:24:45,124 --> 00:24:48,543
Come on. Come on there, Bill. Come on,
Colonel. That's it. Now, take it easy.

419
00:24:48,544 --> 00:24:50,704
Here, here, here, here!

420
00:24:50,796 --> 00:24:54,382
Now, don't try no rough
stuff. We got you outnumbered.

421
00:24:54,383 --> 00:24:56,509
Hey, cab!

422
00:24:56,635 --> 00:24:59,804
Er... give us one
with a horse on it.

423
00:24:59,805 --> 00:25:03,245
Come on, now. Come
on, steady there.

424
00:25:03,934 --> 00:25:08,229
Come on, steady now,
steady now, Colonel. Steady.

425
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,065
- After you, sir.
- Here... here we go with this again.

426
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:12,525
- Go on in there.
- After you, sir.

427
00:25:12,526 --> 00:25:14,402
- Go on in now.
- After you, sir.

428
00:25:14,403 --> 00:25:17,043
Get in that cab. What do...

429
00:25:18,324 --> 00:25:21,164
Go on, go on, go on, go on.

430
00:25:21,744 --> 00:25:24,913
Yeah. Yeah.

431
00:25:26,332 --> 00:25:32,672
We'II... we'll tell you where in
a minute. We're havin' a meetin'.

432
00:25:43,015 --> 00:25:46,768
Oh, here we... Now,
will you get in that cab?

433
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:49,229
You won't get in, hein?

434
00:25:49,355 --> 00:25:53,107
Well, there ought to be some
way out of this. Let's see.

435
00:25:53,108 --> 00:25:55,944
- You don't mind waiting, do you?
- No, no.

436
00:25:55,945 --> 00:26:00,114
Er... now, that's not
fair. You ain't thinkin'.

437
00:26:00,115 --> 00:26:02,367
Aw... go on, let
him have his own way.

438
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,410
Oh, all right.

439
00:26:08,415 --> 00:26:11,515
- Voulez-vous,
any place. - Yahoo!

440
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:39,362
So nice of you to have come. I
only wish you'd met my husband.

441
00:26:39,363 --> 00:26:43,633
I can't imagine what
could have detained him.

442
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:50,748
- Yahoo!
- Shh!

443
00:26:50,874 --> 00:26:53,084
Oh!

444
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:57,590
Shh. Quiet, quiet, quiet,
quiet. Keep him quiet.

445
00:27:03,637 --> 00:27:06,598
- Jeff Tuttle from Red Gap!
- Shh! Shh!

446
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,725
Quiet, quiet, quiet!
Quiet, now, quiet!

447
00:27:08,726 --> 00:27:11,856
- We... we gotta sneak in.
- Shh!

448
00:27:23,324 --> 00:27:25,742
- Shh.
- Now, you see? We made it.

449
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:28,244
- Whoo!
- Shh. Keep him quiet, Jeff, go on.

450
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:30,204
- Quiet now, quiet.
- Oh!

451
00:27:30,205 --> 00:27:32,248
Well, hello, Effie.

452
00:27:32,374 --> 00:27:34,917
- It's Effie, boys.
- Hello, Effie.

453
00:27:34,918 --> 00:27:37,629
- Egbert, what does this mean?
- Well, you... you...

454
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,757
Effie, you have no ideia the
trouble we had with the Colonel here.

455
00:27:40,758 --> 00:27:44,302
It come on him when we were in the
art galleries. Er... hold him up, Jeff.

456
00:27:44,303 --> 00:27:46,721
- I got him, I got him.
- You see what I mean?

457
00:27:46,722 --> 00:27:51,351
He's a nice fellow too. It's a shame.
You'll excuse him, will you, folks?

458
00:27:51,352 --> 00:27:53,811
Je suis mortifée.

459
00:27:53,937 --> 00:27:55,897
I'm très amazed.

460
00:27:56,023 --> 00:27:58,024
Adieu, Sr. Standfans.

461
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,026
- Bonsoir, madame.
- Bonsoir, madame.

462
00:28:00,027 --> 00:28:01,694
- Adieu!
- We've had such a lovely evening.

463
00:28:01,695 --> 00:28:07,367
- Bonsoir, madame.
- Bonsoir, madame.

464
00:28:10,454 --> 00:28:12,121
Effie?

465
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:13,748
Erm... Effie?

466
00:28:13,874 --> 00:28:16,167
Er... I...

467
00:28:16,293 --> 00:28:19,837
There... there you are. Now
you see? You see what I mean?

468
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:23,466
He's a man who should never have
liquor. It brings out the beast in him.

469
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:25,927
- Whoo!
- Oh.

470
00:28:26,053 --> 00:28:28,304
I suppose you two
haven't been drinking.

471
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:29,931
- No!
- Yes.

472
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:32,475
Well, we had to.
He... he made us.

473
00:28:32,476 --> 00:28:35,520
Yes, he pulled a
long knife on us.

474
00:28:35,521 --> 00:28:39,721
- I want to speak to
Ruggles alone. - Uh-oh.

475
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:44,529
Do you think it's safe to
leave her alone with him?

476
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,989
- Don't worry about me.
- Well, I don't know, Effie.

477
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:51,369
After all, you know,
you're... you're all I've got.

478
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,663
Now look-a-here,
Ruggles. I'm warning you.

479
00:28:53,664 --> 00:28:57,208
Er... one false move
and, er... you understand?

480
00:28:57,209 --> 00:29:00,545
- Yippee.
- Well, that's better.

481
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:07,009
- What did he say?
- He said yippee.

482
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:09,650
Oh, that's all right, then.

483
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:27,196
Well, Ruggles! And to think I
sent you out to take care of him!

484
00:29:27,197 --> 00:29:29,574
I'm terribly sorry, madam.

485
00:29:29,575 --> 00:29:32,535
Perhaps I should have enquired
of His Lordship about your habits.

486
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:35,037
Yes.

487
00:29:36,498 --> 00:29:40,793
Er... come, come, Ruggles. You...
you better go to bed. Yeah... yes. Oh!

488
00:29:40,794 --> 00:29:44,255
Oh. Oh!

489
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:47,049
Oh! Er...

490
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,430
- Good morning, Ruggles.
- Good morning, madam.

491
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:14,285
Ruggles, I'm horribly
disappointed in you.

492
00:30:14,286 --> 00:30:16,704
Not so disappointed as
I am in myself, madam.

493
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:18,247
And I'm more
than disappointed

494
00:30:18,248 --> 00:30:22,251
because I thought that Egbert
had... had something in him.

495
00:30:22,252 --> 00:30:24,295
Something in
him? Yes, madam.

496
00:30:24,296 --> 00:30:26,172
And to think of
Egbert and Jeff Tuttle

497
00:30:26,173 --> 00:30:28,633
trailing you around Paris
trying to save you from yourself.

498
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:30,885
I shall never
forget that, madam.

499
00:30:30,886 --> 00:30:34,388
Of course, er... Jeff Tuttle's
an Indian but Egbert is different.

500
00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:37,391
- One or two lumps, madam?
- Oh, none, none.

501
00:30:37,392 --> 00:30:41,145
Think of your dragging him out of an
art gallery and taking him places that...

502
00:30:41,146 --> 00:30:43,756
Oh! Must have disgusted him.

503
00:30:43,857 --> 00:30:47,068
Making him ride on
a merry-go-round.

504
00:30:47,069 --> 00:30:49,028
I... I don't know where
you got such ideas.

505
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:52,114
I was not myself, madam.

506
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:55,991
You don't look like
a periodical souse.

507
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,663
Oh, madam, please.

508
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:02,583
But to show that I'm broadminded,
you can go and get yourself a drink.

509
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:04,085
Oh, thank you, madam.

510
00:31:04,086 --> 00:31:06,254
I know how you feel.

511
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:11,008
- Er... on account of my husband.
- Of course, madam.

512
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:15,659
But I shall forgive and
forget. That's my nature.

513
00:31:15,681 --> 00:31:18,307
And now, Ruggles, tomorrow
we're sailing for home.

514
00:31:18,308 --> 00:31:22,186
- Home, madam?
- Yes, home, America. Red Gap.

515
00:31:22,187 --> 00:31:24,146
Oh, yes, madam.

516
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:27,567
Red Gap.

517
00:31:57,264 --> 00:31:59,974
- Is this still Kansas, madam?
- Oh, dear, no!

518
00:31:59,975 --> 00:32:03,185
We're getting into Red Gap. That's
in the state of Washington, you know.

519
00:32:03,186 --> 00:32:04,437
Indeed, madam?

520
00:32:04,438 --> 00:32:07,690
Extraordinary there seem to be none of
the usual signs of an approaching city.

521
00:32:07,691 --> 00:32:10,401
Oh, well, Red Gap ain't
exactly a city, Bill,

522
00:32:10,402 --> 00:32:12,570
but it's the fastest-growin'
town in the West, though.

523
00:32:12,571 --> 00:32:13,571
Yes, sir.

524
00:32:13,697 --> 00:32:16,532
When we get to the station, we'll be
met by my sister and brother-in-law,

525
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:18,910
Sr. and Sra.
Belknap-Jackson.

526
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:21,579
I think you'll find Senhor.
Belknap-Jackson quite the gentleman.

527
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,164
Yeah, yeah, he sure is.

528
00:32:23,165 --> 00:32:26,083
When he found out that Ma
Pettinghill... That's Effie's ma.

529
00:32:26,084 --> 00:32:28,794
When he found out that she
made a barrel of dough in oil,

530
00:32:28,795 --> 00:32:32,006
he come all the way from Boston
just to marry into the family.

531
00:32:32,007 --> 00:32:33,883
- Egbert.
- Ouch. Well, didn't he?

532
00:32:33,884 --> 00:32:35,468
Quiet.

533
00:32:35,594 --> 00:32:39,805
Sr. Belknap-Jackson is the
leader of our Red Gap society.

534
00:32:39,806 --> 00:32:42,600
You know, until he came out
here, you'd hardly believe it,

535
00:32:42,601 --> 00:32:46,020
but nobody even thought of
using doilies under finger bowls.

536
00:32:46,021 --> 00:32:48,230
Did they, Egbert?

537
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:51,442
Nobody even thought
of using finger bowls.

538
00:32:51,443 --> 00:32:54,528
How very extraordinary!

539
00:32:54,655 --> 00:32:57,990
No, sir. Finger bowls.

540
00:33:00,994 --> 00:33:03,955
Here he comes!

541
00:33:04,081 --> 00:33:07,541
I hope Europe
has helped Egbert.

542
00:33:07,668 --> 00:33:10,558
How could anything
help Egbert?

543
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,260
Effie!

544
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:21,514
Oh, my dear! How sweet of
you to come and meet us!

545
00:33:21,515 --> 00:33:25,059
Why, Egbert, how smart you
look! I'd never known it was you.

546
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,895
Well, I hardly know it
myself. Hello, Knappie.

547
00:33:27,896 --> 00:33:30,189
Bill, where are you?
Oh, Colonel Ruggles.

548
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,650
I want you to meet Senhor.
and Sra. Belknap-Jackson.

549
00:33:32,651 --> 00:33:35,361
Er... this is the Boston
Belknap I was telling you about.

550
00:33:35,362 --> 00:33:36,612
How do you do, Colonel?

551
00:33:36,613 --> 00:33:38,906
The Colonel come all the
way from England with us.

552
00:33:38,907 --> 00:33:41,200
You'll find a few of us
here that really matter.

553
00:33:41,201 --> 00:33:43,369
He's Egbert's manservant.

554
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,830
- His valet?
- Yes. Oh!

555
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:49,500
Egbert!

556
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:51,043
Ma!

557
00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:53,546
Well, you durn dude!

558
00:33:53,672 --> 00:33:56,340
Ma Pettingill,
you wild maverick!

559
00:33:56,341 --> 00:33:58,384
You durn horned toad!

560
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,386
What have they done to you,
made you ambassador from Paris?

561
00:34:00,387 --> 00:34:03,514
I do look kind of foreign, don't I? Well,
let me show you something. Come here.

562
00:34:03,515 --> 00:34:06,559
- Effie!
- Mother!

563
00:34:06,685 --> 00:34:09,937
Well, durn me if you
don't look like a lady!

564
00:34:09,938 --> 00:34:11,939
Oh, Ma, here's the
fella that done it to me.

565
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,108
Colonel Ruggles, this
is our Ma Pettingill.

566
00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:16,110
- Hiya, Colonel.
- How do you do?

567
00:34:16,111 --> 00:34:17,778
- Where's your uniform?
- Mother.

568
00:34:17,779 --> 00:34:19,989
- Hein?
- This is Egbert's servant.

569
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:23,880
No! You look as funny
as Belknap-Jackson!

570
00:34:24,202 --> 00:34:27,830
- Ruggles, bring the luggage.
- Yes, sir.

571
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:29,415
Hiya, Buck!

572
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:33,127
- Hello, fellers.
- How do you do, Egbert?

573
00:34:33,128 --> 00:34:36,738
Why, you long drink
of water, I'II...

574
00:34:37,591 --> 00:34:39,133
Say, who's your friend?

575
00:34:39,134 --> 00:34:43,512
Oh, boys, I want you to meet Colonel
Ruggles, a special friend of mine.

576
00:34:43,513 --> 00:34:47,743
Any friend of Egbert's
is a friend of ours.

577
00:34:57,903 --> 00:35:00,863
Well, Colonel, I think
you're going to like it here.

578
00:35:00,864 --> 00:35:03,074
If Egbert likes you,
you must be a regular guy

579
00:35:03,075 --> 00:35:05,284
and if you're a regular
guy, you're OK with Red Gap.

580
00:35:05,285 --> 00:35:08,621
- Thank you, madam.
- Don't keep calling me madam.

581
00:35:08,622 --> 00:35:11,165
Ma's my name. Ma Pettingill.

582
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:16,003
Any time you can't find Egbert,
just try the old Silver Dollar.

583
00:35:16,004 --> 00:35:18,005
We'll be there.

584
00:35:21,468 --> 00:35:23,768
- Hiya, Ma.
- Hiya, Sam.

585
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:33,270
The others'll be along in a minute.
Libby, Willy, meet Colonel Ruggles.

586
00:35:33,271 --> 00:35:36,781
- Howdy-do. - How
do you do, Colonel?

587
00:35:42,114 --> 00:35:45,074
- A genuine blackamoor, madam?
- Oh, yeah.

588
00:35:45,075 --> 00:35:48,135
- And a China
person? - Uh-hein.

589
00:35:48,703 --> 00:35:51,793
What do you think
of the place?

590
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:55,584
It's large.

591
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,838
Belknap-Jackson and my two daughters
put their house-building ideas together

592
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:00,881
and this is what happened.

593
00:36:00,882 --> 00:36:03,467
The only thing I had to
do with it was pay for it.

594
00:36:03,468 --> 00:36:09,938
But I can't lose. I can sell it
any time to the city for a depot.

595
00:36:10,142 --> 00:36:12,226
And then I go on to say,

596
00:36:12,227 --> 00:36:15,646
"The Flouds were accompanied
by their English manservant,

597
00:36:15,647 --> 00:36:20,151
"secured through the courtesy
of the Earl of Burnstead.

598
00:36:20,152 --> 00:36:24,822
"He will no doubt lend a continental
flavour to the Floud mansion."

599
00:36:24,823 --> 00:36:26,824
- How's that, Belknap?
- I think...

600
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:29,451
Yeah, some mess of words.

601
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:34,456
Egbert, I want you to take this over
to Jake Henshaw at the newspaper office

602
00:36:34,457 --> 00:36:36,333
and be sure that
he prints it.

603
00:36:36,334 --> 00:36:38,961
- Ruggles!
- Yes, madam!

604
00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:42,381
- Oh, Ruggles!
- Yes, madam.

605
00:36:43,341 --> 00:36:45,634
- Are you ready?
- Yes, madam.

606
00:36:45,635 --> 00:36:49,680
Er... Ruggles, I want you to accompany
Sr. Floud to the newspaper office.

607
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:50,801
Yes, madam.

608
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:53,851
And, er... see that he
makes no stops on the way.

609
00:36:53,852 --> 00:36:56,478
- Oh, Effie, you know me.
- Yes.

610
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:58,689
Oh, look-a-here, do
I have to carry these?

611
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:01,275
- Why, certainly.
- Oh...!

612
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,905
- Oh, Ruggles?
- Yes, sir?

613
00:37:06,907 --> 00:37:09,158
Will you see that he
comes straight home?

614
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:12,779
Remember, we're
holding you responsible.

615
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:20,044
- ? By the light
- ? By the light, by the light

616
00:37:20,045 --> 00:37:22,213
? Of the silvery moon

617
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:24,757
? Of the silvery moon...

618
00:37:24,883 --> 00:37:28,636
Listen, listen, Bill. That's Nell
Kenner singing. Ain't that pretty?

619
00:37:28,637 --> 00:37:31,388
- Who, sir?
- This is Nell Kenner's house. Come on.

620
00:37:31,389 --> 00:37:34,391
May I remind you we are instructed to
proceed to the newspaper office, sir?

621
00:37:34,392 --> 00:37:38,145
Yeah, well, we'll get around to that.
We'll head in here first. Come on.

622
00:37:38,146 --> 00:37:42,733
You know, Effie and her circle of cats
is always got their harpoons out for Nell.

623
00:37:42,734 --> 00:37:44,777
But believe me, she's
as right as a church.

624
00:37:44,778 --> 00:37:47,863
But it is highly improper for you to
take your valet about with you, sir.

625
00:37:47,864 --> 00:37:52,576
Aw, they won't know you from the
Duke of Kakiac. Come on in and mix.

626
00:37:52,577 --> 00:37:54,036
Oh, no, sir.

627
00:37:54,162 --> 00:37:57,248
Say, look-a-here, who are
you working for anyway?

628
00:37:57,249 --> 00:37:59,083
You, sir.

629
00:37:59,209 --> 00:38:03,212
- Mix, sir? Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

630
00:38:03,338 --> 00:38:06,215
Uh-oh, look out,
I forgot something.

631
00:38:06,216 --> 00:38:08,634
Come here, come here.

632
00:38:09,636 --> 00:38:12,721
You better take this pool
cue and these mittens, see?

633
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:14,431
If the gang ever
caught me with those,

634
00:38:14,432 --> 00:38:17,393
they'd run me out of town hitched
to a horse's tail or something.

635
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:21,605
Go on, go on, take 'em. You can get
away with it. You're a foreigner.

636
00:38:21,606 --> 00:38:23,357
Look out there!

637
00:38:23,483 --> 00:38:26,402
- Well, Sourdough!
- Hello, Eddie.

638
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:28,779
- When did you get off the trail?
- Just got in, just got in.

639
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:32,741
- Hello, Sourdough.
- Hello, Doc.

640
00:38:32,867 --> 00:38:35,619
Eddie, I want you to meet my
good friend Colonel Ruggles.

641
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,664
- Colonel, I'm glad to know you, sir.
- How do you do?

642
00:38:38,665 --> 00:38:41,166
Yeah, this is Doc Squires.
Doc Squires, Colonel Ruggles.

643
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:43,085
- Put her there, Colonel.
- How do you do?

644
00:38:43,086 --> 00:38:47,756
Doc is a feller that'll give
you castor oil for everything.

645
00:38:47,757 --> 00:38:49,967
Wait a minute. I got something
on my mind. Now, what was it?

646
00:38:49,968 --> 00:38:52,219
- That's it. Where's the beer barrel?
- Over there.

647
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:55,931
Well, let's go to it. We'll
be seeing you around, boys.

648
00:38:55,932 --> 00:38:57,975
- Hello, Harry!
- Hello, boy.

649
00:38:57,976 --> 00:39:00,477
- Shake hands with Colonel Ruggles.
- I'm very glad to know you.

650
00:39:00,478 --> 00:39:03,147
And Stella. Stella, Harry's
wife. Colonel Ruggles.

651
00:39:03,148 --> 00:39:05,607
Get out, get out! Oh, you're
way in over your head there.

652
00:39:05,608 --> 00:39:08,068
Well, Sourdough!

653
00:39:08,194 --> 00:39:09,987
Hello, Hank, my boy.

654
00:39:09,988 --> 00:39:12,323
Hank, I want you to meet my good
friend Colonel Ruggles. This is Hank.

655
00:39:12,324 --> 00:39:14,074
- How are you, Colonel?
- How do you do?

656
00:39:14,075 --> 00:39:15,534
- Egbert!
- Who's calling?

657
00:39:15,535 --> 00:39:18,537
- Why, Nell! Yippee!
- Egbert, come here!

658
00:39:18,538 --> 00:39:21,165
Ha-ha-ha! Pull out your anchor,
Bill. I'll be with you in a minute.

659
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:24,886
- Have a beer, Colonel.
- Oh, thank you.

660
00:39:25,337 --> 00:39:27,129
Oh, you old darling!

661
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,965
Ha-ha! Nell Kenner, you're
a sight for sore eyes.

662
00:39:29,966 --> 00:39:32,217
Aw, gee, Red Gap hasn't
been the same without you.

663
00:39:32,218 --> 00:39:33,802
Aw, you're joshing me.

664
00:39:33,803 --> 00:39:35,512
- There you are.
- Oh, thank you.

665
00:39:35,513 --> 00:39:38,057
Oh, Jake. Shake hands
with Colonel Ruggles.

666
00:39:38,058 --> 00:39:40,225
- Hein?
- Jake Henshaw, Colonel.

667
00:39:40,226 --> 00:39:43,604
- The best newspaperman in the West.
- How do you do?

668
00:39:43,605 --> 00:39:46,357
- Colonel? What army?
- The truth of the matter is that...

669
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:48,609
I got it. British
army, of course.

670
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,070
- Now, what's your first name, Colonel?
- It isn't ever used.

671
00:39:51,071 --> 00:39:52,946
- Oh, just for the paper.
- Come on.

672
00:39:52,947 --> 00:39:56,147
Tell him your
first name, Colonel.

673
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,370
Marmaduke.

674
00:40:02,123 --> 00:40:04,708
No foolin'?

675
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:07,127
Well, anyhow, how do
you like our fair city?

676
00:40:07,128 --> 00:40:08,712
Oh, toppin'.

677
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:12,007
- Like it, hein?
- I've never seen anything like it.

678
00:40:12,008 --> 00:40:13,967
Well, have you met
any of our fair women?

679
00:40:13,968 --> 00:40:15,511
I've not yet had
that pleasure.

680
00:40:15,512 --> 00:40:18,305
Well, come on and try some
of our fair food, Colonel.

681
00:40:18,306 --> 00:40:21,809
- Oh, thank you.
- Here we are.

682
00:40:21,935 --> 00:40:25,562
Colonel Marmaduke Ruggles.

683
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:28,482
Oh, now wait a minute.

684
00:40:28,608 --> 00:40:31,693
Let the old horse thief tell
about his trip in his own way.

685
00:40:31,694 --> 00:40:36,115
Horse thief, she called me! You want I
should tell you in English or in French?

686
00:40:36,116 --> 00:40:39,284
French.

687
00:40:39,411 --> 00:40:41,161
Who said that?

688
00:40:41,287 --> 00:40:45,937
You would. It couldn't
have been a little feller.

689
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,465
I say, who is responsible
for this sauce?

690
00:40:53,466 --> 00:40:55,092
Me.

691
00:40:55,218 --> 00:40:57,761
Very excellent it is
indeed, my good woman.

692
00:40:57,762 --> 00:41:01,682
If you're calling me a good woman cos
you don't know my name, it's Judson.

693
00:41:01,683 --> 00:41:03,892
Delighted to make your
acquaintance, I'm sure.

694
00:41:03,893 --> 00:41:05,602
- And who am I...
- Pardon me, Colonel.

695
00:41:05,603 --> 00:41:09,648
I've got it up to "Colonel Marmaduke
Ruggles, British Army retired."

696
00:41:09,649 --> 00:41:11,400
You're staying with
the Flouds, are you not?

697
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:13,861
- Yes, but only...
- Thank you. That's all I wanted to know.

698
00:41:13,862 --> 00:41:15,779
- I'll see you a little later.
- I say!

699
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,074
Oh. So, you like my
meat sauce, do you?

700
00:41:19,075 --> 00:41:21,910
It's very good.
It's almost perfect.

701
00:41:21,911 --> 00:41:23,745
What do you mean,
almost perfect?

702
00:41:23,746 --> 00:41:26,874
I was just thinking that perhaps a few
drops of this and a little bit of that

703
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:29,168
might make it into a
really superlative sauce.

704
00:41:29,169 --> 00:41:31,962
So, that's what you're thinking, is
it? Well, let me tell you something.

705
00:41:31,963 --> 00:41:35,048
That I've been making meat sauce
for longer than I can remember,

706
00:41:35,049 --> 00:41:37,301
and nobody's ever found
fault with it before.

707
00:41:37,302 --> 00:41:38,844
I wasn't finding
fault with it.

708
00:41:38,845 --> 00:41:41,513
What do you mean by a few drops
of this and a little bit of that?

709
00:41:41,514 --> 00:41:44,349
Oh, I only meant that perhaps a
little spice and some wine vinegar...

710
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,684
Listen, Colonel.

711
00:41:45,685 --> 00:41:52,107
You'd better stick to something you
know about, like leading a regiment.

712
00:41:52,108 --> 00:41:54,276
Let's not have an
international row about it.

713
00:41:54,277 --> 00:41:55,861
Well...

714
00:41:55,987 --> 00:41:58,197
Shall we dance?

715
00:41:58,323 --> 00:42:02,326
Well, I really shouldn't.
I've got work to do.

716
00:42:02,327 --> 00:42:06,079
Oh? Er... are you
in service here?

717
00:42:06,206 --> 00:42:08,499
If you mean do I
work here, why, yes.

718
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,959
I always help Nell Kenner
out when she gives a party.

719
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,921
- Oh, I...
- I see what you mean.

720
00:42:13,922 --> 00:42:17,049
A man in your position wouldn't
expect the help to dance,

721
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:19,218
but nobody minds
here, Colonel.

722
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:20,439
It's funny,

723
00:42:20,512 --> 00:42:27,351
but you're the first one that ever
made me feel different than anyone else.

724
00:42:27,352 --> 00:42:29,978
Might I have the
pleasure of this waltz?

725
00:42:29,979 --> 00:42:32,356
Why, sure.

726
00:42:32,482 --> 00:42:35,025
This is the newspaper
office, isn't it?

727
00:42:35,026 --> 00:42:37,402
And Sr. Floud isn't there?

728
00:42:37,403 --> 00:42:41,393
He's not there. Has
Sr. Floud been there?

729
00:42:41,407 --> 00:42:44,409
Are you sure Sr. Floud
hasn't been there?

730
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:48,330
What? Why don't I
try Nell Kenner's?

731
00:42:48,456 --> 00:42:50,958
She's giving a beer bust?

732
00:42:51,084 --> 00:42:54,711
What would my husband
be doing at a beer bust?

733
00:42:54,712 --> 00:42:56,171
Drinking?

734
00:42:56,297 --> 00:42:59,007
None of your lip, young man!

735
00:43:00,093 --> 00:43:03,887
He's at the beer bust. Now there'll
be nothing in the paper tomorrow.

736
00:43:03,888 --> 00:43:05,847
I'm surprised at Ruggles.

737
00:43:05,848 --> 00:43:08,559
Well, you'd
better get going.

738
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,019
And hurry. Hurry!

739
00:43:15,149 --> 00:43:17,442
Just between us, Schwartzie,
what do you think?

740
00:43:17,443 --> 00:43:19,319
I don't even like
the buttonholes.

741
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,406
I know just how you feel, Schwartzie.
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

742
00:43:22,407 --> 00:43:25,742
I'm gonna get rid of all these here
dude clothes and get me some new ones.

743
00:43:25,743 --> 00:43:28,537
So, I want you to take an
order right now for ten suits.

744
00:43:28,538 --> 00:43:31,123
- Ten suits?
- Yeah, and make 'em all checks.

745
00:43:31,124 --> 00:43:33,834
- Checks?
- Yeah. Here, here, Bill!

746
00:43:33,835 --> 00:43:38,275
That's, er... a little
close even for Red Gap!

747
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:51,469
He dances with finesse.

748
00:43:52,228 --> 00:43:56,023
Colonel Ruggles, what did Senhor.
Henshaw say your first name is?

749
00:43:56,024 --> 00:43:58,025
Oh, it's never used.

750
00:43:58,026 --> 00:44:01,945
- Oh, what is it?
- You'd laugh at it.

751
00:44:02,071 --> 00:44:04,811
No, I wouldn't. What is it?

752
00:44:05,992 --> 00:44:09,995
- It's Marmaduke.
- Oh, that's nice.

753
00:44:10,121 --> 00:44:12,372
Mine's Prunella.

754
00:44:36,147 --> 00:44:38,482
Oh, er... Ruggles?

755
00:44:51,454 --> 00:44:55,248
- Well, Ruggles, enjoying yourself?
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

756
00:44:55,249 --> 00:44:58,335
Well, that's fine. What prompted
you to mingle with the guests?

757
00:44:58,336 --> 00:45:01,672
Oh, sir, I had definite instructions
from Sr. Floud, sir, to mix.

758
00:45:01,673 --> 00:45:04,091
I'm sorry to spoil
your pleasure.

759
00:45:04,092 --> 00:45:06,635
But you must come
home with me at once.

760
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:08,637
I... I feel it
incumbent upon me, sir,

761
00:45:08,638 --> 00:45:11,056
to see if that coincides
with Sr. Floud's wishes, sir.

762
00:45:11,057 --> 00:45:14,559
Never mind Sr. Floud. He can
stay here. You're coming with me.

763
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,550
I think I should speak
to Sr. Floud, sir.

764
00:45:32,787 --> 00:45:35,831
I won't be kicked by a
servant, English or otherwise.

765
00:45:35,832 --> 00:45:38,250
Are you still going
to harbour the ruffian?

766
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:42,071
- He's an anarchist.
- He's an assassin.

767
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,506
I fail to see anything
funny about it, Mater.

768
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:47,175
You will! You will!

769
00:45:47,301 --> 00:45:48,885
Quiet, Mother.

770
00:45:49,011 --> 00:45:52,180
Ruggles, how
could you do it?

771
00:45:52,306 --> 00:45:55,559
I coarsely gave way
to the brute in me.

772
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,979
Sr. Belknap-Jackson
is quite right.

773
00:45:59,105 --> 00:46:01,773
Will you be quiet, Mother?

774
00:46:01,899 --> 00:46:04,776
In Paris, you led my
poor husband astray.

775
00:46:04,777 --> 00:46:07,779
And now you've started
assaulting the family.

776
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,116
Ruggles, you
will have to go.

777
00:46:11,242 --> 00:46:16,246
You mean, madam, that I am to be
turned loose in this remote settlement?

778
00:46:16,247 --> 00:46:17,873
Remote settlement?

779
00:46:17,999 --> 00:46:20,584
You see, Effie? The
man's quite impossible.

780
00:46:20,585 --> 00:46:24,305
You'd better pack
your bags immediately.

781
00:46:25,548 --> 00:46:27,841
Just a minute, Bill.

782
00:46:27,967 --> 00:46:29,843
Before you go throwing
Bill out on his ear,

783
00:46:29,844 --> 00:46:34,354
you'd better read this
here piece in the paper.

784
00:46:39,479 --> 00:46:42,230
Oh.

785
00:46:42,356 --> 00:46:44,733
Oh!

786
00:46:44,859 --> 00:46:48,320
Oh! Oh!

787
00:46:48,446 --> 00:46:51,366
- What is it?
- It's terrible.

788
00:46:51,908 --> 00:46:53,742
"Colonel Marmaduke Ruggles,

789
00:46:53,743 --> 00:46:56,244

792
00:47:04,295 --> 00:47:07,005
Look, look! It
says it right there.

793
00:47:07,006 --> 00:47:12,552
"An honoured house guest of
Sr. and Sra. Egbert Floud!"

794
00:47:12,678 --> 00:47:15,889
Disaster! Complete
social disaster!

795
00:47:16,015 --> 00:47:18,517
"A series of entertainments

It's continued on page five.

Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you.

802
00:47:54,262 --> 00:47:56,638
What can happen next?

803
00:47:57,807 --> 00:48:01,268
Oh, how do you do? Why,
this must be Colonel Ruggles.

804
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:04,271
I'm Sra. Ballard.
Sra. Judy Ballard.

805
00:48:04,272 --> 00:48:07,190
I simply had to make
your acquaintance.

806
00:48:07,191 --> 00:48:10,026
- This is Sra. Myron Carey.
- How do you do?

807
00:48:10,027 --> 00:48:12,070
- And Miss Sarah Grant.
- How do you do?

808
00:48:12,071 --> 00:48:15,073
They were just
crazy to meet you!

809
00:48:15,074 --> 00:48:17,742
Hello, Effie darling!

810
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:21,121
My, how fortunate you are to
have such a distinguished visitor!

811
00:48:21,122 --> 00:48:22,664
Yes. Er... yes.

812
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:26,668
This is the most eventful thing
that has ever happened to Red Gap.

813
00:48:26,669 --> 00:48:28,587
Or, er... to me.

814
00:48:28,713 --> 00:48:30,422
Yes.

815
00:48:30,548 --> 00:48:32,340
Er... yes.

816
00:48:36,262 --> 00:48:37,804
Oh.

817
00:48:38,764 --> 00:48:39,973
Sra. Wallaby,

818
00:48:39,974 --> 00:48:43,810
our old friend Colonel Marmaduke
Ruggles, late of the British Army.

819
00:48:43,811 --> 00:48:45,896
Oh, I've been dying
to meet you, Colonel.

820
00:48:45,897 --> 00:48:47,272
- How do you do?
- What was your regiment?

821
00:48:47,273 --> 00:48:51,902
- We're all ready for the picture.
- Oh, the picture, Sra. Wallaby, yes.

822
00:48:51,903 --> 00:48:54,154
Right this way.

823
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,158
Just as quickly as you possibly
can, please, and everyone look happy.

824
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:02,621
Er... smile, Colonel. Er... Senhora.
Floud there in front of the table.

825
00:49:02,622 --> 00:49:05,457
That's it. Now, everyone look
at the Colonel and smile, please.

826
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:08,418
Now, Colonel, relax just
a bit. No, no, the face.

827
00:49:08,419 --> 00:49:10,587
Now a little
smile. That's it.

828
00:49:10,588 --> 00:49:14,466
Now, Sra. Floud, look at the
Colonel and smile nicely, please.

829
00:49:14,467 --> 00:49:17,761
Oh, a little better smile than
that. Oh, just a little better.

830
00:49:17,762 --> 00:49:20,513
Now, Colonel, look at Sra. Floud.
Sra. Floud, look at the Colonel.

831
00:49:20,514 --> 00:49:23,308
Now a big smile. Big. Big!

832
00:49:23,434 --> 00:49:25,477
Oh, that's it!

833
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:49,376
I will ask you to drink to the health
of our distinguished guest of honour,

834
00:49:49,377 --> 00:49:51,647
Colonel Marmaduke Ruggles.

835
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:55,799
I know we would
all like to hear

836
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,302
some of Colonel Ruggles'
experiences in the British Army.

837
00:49:59,303 --> 00:50:01,805
- No. Oh, no. No, no.
- No, no.

838
00:50:01,806 --> 00:50:03,974
- I couldn't talk about my exploits.
- No.

839
00:50:03,975 --> 00:50:06,643
- Oh, Effie, do make him talk.
- Oh, no. No, really.

840
00:50:06,644 --> 00:50:11,314
You see, the Colonel spent many years
with the Black Watch in darkest Africa.

841
00:50:11,315 --> 00:50:14,693
You... you were a Black
Watchman, weren't you, Colonel?

842
00:50:14,694 --> 00:50:16,778
Ha-ha. Hm.

843
00:50:20,616 --> 00:50:22,283
- Whoa.
- Why, Colonel Ruggles.

844
00:50:22,284 --> 00:50:24,285
Good afternoon, Sra. Judson.

845
00:50:24,286 --> 00:50:25,954
Whoa.

846
00:50:36,966 --> 00:50:39,718
Oh, I say, that print
gown suits you no end.

847
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:42,879
- Oh, do you like it?
- Oh, yes.

848
00:50:43,347 --> 00:50:46,474
What a spiffy little
garden you have!

849
00:50:46,475 --> 00:50:50,186
I suppose it would be expecting
too much to ask you in for tea?

850
00:50:50,187 --> 00:50:52,063
Oh, I should say rather not.

851
00:50:52,064 --> 00:50:53,815
Oh.

852
00:51:08,205 --> 00:51:09,873
Sr. Barker, stop! Come here!

853
00:51:09,874 --> 00:51:12,834
Get out! Sr. Barker!

854
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,503
Sr. Barker! Out!

855
00:51:16,172 --> 00:51:19,549
There. I'm so sorry.

856
00:51:20,426 --> 00:51:23,553
You see, he's never
seen an English cowboy.

857
00:51:23,554 --> 00:51:25,180
Cowboy?

858
00:51:25,806 --> 00:51:27,390
Hm.

859
00:51:28,517 --> 00:51:30,477
I say, what a snug
little home you have.

860
00:51:30,478 --> 00:51:33,063
Well, I just sort of
fixed it up myself.

861
00:51:33,064 --> 00:51:35,482
Did you?

862
00:51:35,608 --> 00:51:38,735
- Oh! Goldfish.
- Oh!

863
00:51:38,861 --> 00:51:41,446
I have always derived
intense satisfaction

864
00:51:41,447 --> 00:51:44,307
from their silent
companionship.

865
00:51:44,366 --> 00:51:47,494
Oh, have you?

866
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:53,458
Oh, how quaint!

867
00:51:53,584 --> 00:51:57,462
- Who is this?
- Oh, that was Elmo.

868
00:51:57,588 --> 00:51:59,798
Sr. Judson.

869
00:51:59,924 --> 00:52:04,511
He got kicked by his favourite
mule and he never got over it.

870
00:52:04,512 --> 00:52:07,972
Oh, excuse me, Colonel, while I
go and heat the water for the tea.

871
00:52:07,973 --> 00:52:10,193
Oh, can't I help you?

872
00:52:16,315 --> 00:52:18,233
It's hot.

873
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:21,736
- May I be of any assistance?
- Oh, no.

874
00:52:21,737 --> 00:52:25,107
Men are so helpless
in the kitchen.

875
00:52:27,785 --> 00:52:29,119
Oh, no.

876
00:52:29,245 --> 00:52:32,914
Always bring the pot to the kettle.
Never bring the kettle to the pot.

877
00:52:32,915 --> 00:52:36,084
Listen, Colonel, I've been making tea
for longer than I can remember and...

878
00:52:36,085 --> 00:52:38,670
Don't let's get into
difficulties about this.

879
00:52:38,671 --> 00:52:40,755
But you must listen to
an Englishman about tea.

880
00:52:40,756 --> 00:52:43,383
If it were coffee, I
should be your pupil.

881
00:52:43,384 --> 00:52:47,762
But we're making tea, and when making
tea, always bring the pot to the kettle

882
00:52:47,763 --> 00:52:49,597
and never bring the
kettle to the pot.

883
00:52:49,598 --> 00:52:52,392
Oh, Colonel, your
knowledge is surprising.

884
00:52:52,393 --> 00:52:55,436
I don't see why you should
say surprising, Sra. Judson.

885
00:52:55,437 --> 00:52:58,356
The best cooks have
always been men.

886
00:52:58,357 --> 00:53:02,735
I myself have pronounced views as to
the preparation and serving of food.

887
00:53:02,736 --> 00:53:04,487
- Have you?
- Oh, yes.

888
00:53:04,488 --> 00:53:07,031
Well, do you know something
nice that will go with tea?

889
00:53:07,032 --> 00:53:12,120
Er... yes, yes. The ingredients are
quite simple too. Have you a little flour?

890
00:53:12,121 --> 00:53:15,291
- Oh, would you, Colonel?
- Rather.

891
00:53:17,042 --> 00:53:20,712
It, er... needs flour,
butter, milk, and salt.

892
00:53:20,713 --> 00:53:24,424
Oh, Colonel, you seem so
at home in the kitchen.

893
00:53:24,425 --> 00:53:27,510
Ah, Sra. Judson, it would
be difficult to describe

894
00:53:27,511 --> 00:53:30,847
the intense satisfaction I have
always derived from cooking.

895
00:53:30,848 --> 00:53:32,682
And goldfish.

896
00:53:32,808 --> 00:53:35,059
Er... well, no, no.

897
00:53:37,146 --> 00:53:40,231
Oh, Colonel, you must write
out this recipe for me.

898
00:53:40,232 --> 00:53:43,151
Nothing would give me greater
pleasure, Sra. Judson. Dear me!

899
00:53:43,152 --> 00:53:46,487
- You should open a restaurant.
- Hm.

900
00:53:46,488 --> 00:53:49,282
He's back again!
Down, sir! Down, sir!

901
00:53:49,283 --> 00:53:53,995
- Sr. Barker, out! Out! Out! Sr. Barker!
- Down, sir! Down, sir! Down, sir!

902
00:53:53,996 --> 00:53:55,538
Here. Get!

903
00:53:55,664 --> 00:53:57,290
Oh...!

904
00:54:02,796 --> 00:54:06,341
We're goin' out to the ranch for
a few days to get away from it all.

905
00:54:06,342 --> 00:54:08,176
- Heh-heh! Ain't that right,
Ma? - That's the ideia.

906
00:54:08,177 --> 00:54:10,261
- All right, Nelly?
- This is Henry.

907
00:54:10,262 --> 00:54:12,472
Yeah. Go on, Henry.

908
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,653
Enjoying yourself?

909
00:54:26,779 --> 00:54:29,239
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

910
00:54:29,365 --> 00:54:31,366
I've been taking the
liberty of reading again

911
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:33,618
the life of your great
American statesman, sir.

912
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:34,953
Oh?

913
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:36,913
You seem in a very
good mood yourself.

914
00:54:36,914 --> 00:54:42,214
I am. It's a pleasure to
tell you that you're through.

915
00:54:43,379 --> 00:54:45,880
- Did you say...
- You're fired, Ruggles.

916
00:54:45,881 --> 00:54:52,061
Sra. Floud instructed me to pay
your railroad fare to São Francisco.

917
00:54:52,096 --> 00:54:54,055
Yes, sir.

918
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:57,642
There's a train leaving at
noon. See that you're on it.

919
00:54:57,643 --> 00:55:00,061
What? Train, sir?
Train, sir? Yes, sir.

920
00:55:00,062 --> 00:55:02,647
Er... train, sir.

921
00:55:08,821 --> 00:55:10,863
Goodbye to you, sir.

922
00:55:12,324 --> 00:55:14,409
Goodbye, sir.

923
00:55:23,252 --> 00:55:24,711
- Oh, it's late.
- Yeah.

924
00:55:24,712 --> 00:55:26,170
Um...

925
00:55:26,297 --> 00:55:28,279
Oh, in that case,
could you tell me

926
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,591
where I could obtain
an inexpensive meal?

927
00:55:30,592 --> 00:55:34,178
Er... try the Silver Dollar.
They've a swell free lunch there.

928
00:55:34,179 --> 00:55:38,391
Oh, thank you. Er... could
I deposit my luggage here?

929
00:55:38,392 --> 00:55:42,592
Er... yeah, leave 'em
there. I'll watch 'em.

930
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:44,856
Thank you.

931
00:55:58,704 --> 00:56:00,371
- Hello, Colonel.
- How do you do?

932
00:56:00,372 --> 00:56:03,207
- What'll you have?
- A small glass of beer, thank you.

933
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:05,126
- A small one, hein?
- How are you, Colonel?

934
00:56:05,127 --> 00:56:08,171
- Howdy, Colonel.
- How do you do?

935
00:56:08,172 --> 00:56:11,507
- How have you been?
- In excellent health, thank you.

936
00:56:11,508 --> 00:56:16,179
Er... do you know, I think I
could do with a bite of food.

937
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:20,558
Oh, we have a fine lunch on
today. Right down here, Colonel.

938
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,269
- How's tricks?
- Oh, jolly.

939
00:56:24,313 --> 00:56:27,148
Ah, them's nice
pig's feet, Colonel.

940
00:56:27,149 --> 00:56:29,067
Yes.

941
00:56:29,193 --> 00:56:32,445
Hi, Bill! Look,
Ma, here's Bill.

942
00:56:32,571 --> 00:56:35,531
Come in here,
you old lone wolf.

943
00:56:35,532 --> 00:56:37,658
Oh, pardon me.

944
00:56:37,785 --> 00:56:40,203
Tryin' to sneak one
over on us, hein?

945
00:56:40,204 --> 00:56:43,854
- Hi, Bill.
- Here, sit down, sit down.

946
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:47,543
I thought you'd departed
for the ranch, sir.

947
00:56:47,544 --> 00:56:51,130
We just stopped in here first
for a little snort. Sit down.

948
00:56:51,131 --> 00:56:52,423
This is very awkward, sir.

949
00:56:52,424 --> 00:56:54,592
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

950
00:56:54,593 --> 00:56:57,053
- Are you drunk, Colonel?
- Ye... Drunk? Heck, no.

951
00:56:57,054 --> 00:57:00,890
I would like you to know that I have only
the kindliest feelings towards you both.

952
00:57:00,891 --> 00:57:02,934
He's tight as a tick.

953
00:57:02,935 --> 00:57:05,144
Ye... No, no, he ain't.

954
00:57:05,145 --> 00:57:09,607
Come on, Bill, loosen up.
Now, what's gnawin' on you?

955
00:57:09,608 --> 00:57:12,948
Yeah, I thought
there was somethin'.

956
00:57:15,489 --> 00:57:17,865
No longer require
your services?

957
00:57:17,866 --> 00:57:20,868
Belknap-Jackson!

958
00:57:20,994 --> 00:57:24,247
Why, the sku... I'll
cut out his windpipe!

959
00:57:24,248 --> 00:57:26,499
- The sneakin' coyote!
- Why, look-a-here, Bill.

960
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,419
We wouldn't fire you even if
you looked like that feller.

961
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:32,130
I couldn't be happier, sir.
I couldn't be happier, madam.

962
00:57:32,131 --> 00:57:34,382
Oh, yes, you could.
Here, drink that.

963
00:57:34,383 --> 00:57:36,426
Yeah, and follow
it up with this.

964
00:57:36,427 --> 00:57:40,012
I tell you, that Belknap-Jackson
is a Boston cream puff.

965
00:57:40,013 --> 00:57:42,348
You're working
for me, ain't you?

966
00:57:42,349 --> 00:57:47,437
Oh, excuse me. I couldn't help
but hear. But I don't understand.

967
00:57:47,438 --> 00:57:51,708
- Well, tell her, Ma.
- Come on and sit down.

968
00:57:52,359 --> 00:57:53,860
Listen.

969
00:57:56,405 --> 00:57:58,072
- No!
- Yeah, that's right.

970
00:57:58,073 --> 00:57:59,740
Then you're just an ord...

971
00:57:59,741 --> 00:58:02,869
- Oh, this is wonderful news.
- Come have a drink.

972
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:05,246
No, I just came over
for some cooking sherry.

973
00:58:05,247 --> 00:58:06,831
Well, I'll tell
you what we'll do.

974
00:58:06,832 --> 00:58:09,959
We'll all have one more shot and then
we'll move Bill back into the house.

975
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,810
- What do you say?
- No, sir.

976
00:58:14,006 --> 00:58:15,673
- I'd rather not.
- Why not?

977
00:58:15,674 --> 00:58:19,218
Well, sir, I can't go
on posing as what I'm not

978
00:58:19,219 --> 00:58:24,640
and, er... I don't wish to
remain in service any longer, sir.

979
00:58:24,641 --> 00:58:27,143
I want to make
something of myself.

980
00:58:27,144 --> 00:58:31,230
I would like to stand
on my own two feet.

981
00:58:31,231 --> 00:58:36,319
This is a land, sir, of great
opportunity where all are created equal.

982
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,697
There, that's... that's what
I been... Now you're talkin'.

983
00:58:39,698 --> 00:58:42,533
Like Lincoln said
that day at Gettysburg.

984
00:58:42,534 --> 00:58:46,579
He hit the nail right on
the nose when he said...

985
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,289
Well, what did he say?

986
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:51,459
That's funny. I was gonna
ask you the same thing.

987
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,836
He, er... What did he say?

988
00:58:53,837 --> 00:58:55,880
- I don't know. Do you?
- I don't know.

989
00:58:55,881 --> 00:58:58,090
Er... he... he said...

990
00:58:58,217 --> 00:59:00,092
- Hey, Sam!
- Yeah?

991
00:59:00,219 --> 00:59:03,054
What did Lincoln say
that day at Gettysburg?

992
00:59:03,055 --> 00:59:06,345
I don't know but
I'll find out.

993
00:59:08,477 --> 00:59:10,770
What did Lincoln
say at Gettysburg?

994
00:59:10,771 --> 00:59:12,897
I don't know.

995
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:16,359
Harry, what did Lincoln
say at Gettysburg?

996
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,777
I don't know, boss.

997
00:59:17,778 --> 00:59:21,239
Hey, Curly, what did
Lincoln say at Gettysburg?

998
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,825
I don't recollect. Ask Hank.
He reads the newspapers.

999
00:59:24,826 --> 00:59:26,827
- What did he say, Hank?
- I don't know.

1000
00:59:26,828 --> 00:59:29,958
- Ask the boys, will you?
- Sure.

1001
00:59:31,959 --> 00:59:36,749
- Try and find out for me, will you, Harry?
- Sure.

1002
00:59:37,714 --> 00:59:39,131
- Hey.
- Hein?

1003
00:59:39,258 --> 00:59:41,008
What did Lincoln
say at Gettysburg?

1004
00:59:41,009 --> 00:59:44,059
I don't know.
I wasn't there.

1005
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:50,935
What did Lincoln
say at Gettysburg?

1006
00:59:50,936 --> 00:59:53,062
I don't know.
What did he say?

1007
00:59:53,063 --> 00:59:55,022
I was asking you.

1008
00:59:57,526 --> 01:00:00,194
You wasn't there!

1009
01:00:01,989 --> 01:00:04,949
- I couldn't find out.
- That dumb bunch don't know.

1010
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:07,034
There's none of them
there that knows.

1011
01:00:07,035 --> 01:00:10,246
What a fine bunch
of Americans!

1012
01:00:10,372 --> 01:00:12,206
That's funny.

1013
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:14,667
Four score and
seven years ago

1014
01:00:14,668 --> 01:00:18,921
our fathers brought forth, on
this continent, a new nation,

1015
01:00:18,922 --> 01:00:23,926
conceived in liberty and dedicated to the
proposition that all men are created equal.

1016
01:00:23,927 --> 01:00:25,845
Now we are engaged in
a great civil war...

1017
01:00:25,846 --> 01:00:27,555
Why, that's it.

1018
01:00:27,681 --> 01:00:30,308
Bill, don't tell
me you know it.

1019
01:00:30,309 --> 01:00:33,299
- How does it go, Bill?
- Er...

1020
01:00:36,356 --> 01:00:38,941
"Four score and
seven years ago

1021
01:00:38,942 --> 01:00:43,321
"our fathers brought forth, on
this continent, a new nation,

1022
01:00:43,322 --> 01:00:44,780
"conceived in liberty,

1023
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:48,367
"and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal.

1024
01:00:48,368 --> 01:00:52,358
"Now we are engaged
in a great civil war,

1025
01:00:52,664 --> 01:00:57,877
"testing whether that nation, or any
nation so conceived, and so dedicated,

1026
01:00:57,878 --> 01:01:00,171
"can long endure.

1027
01:01:00,297 --> 01:01:04,050
"We are now on a great
battlefield of that war.

1028
01:01:04,051 --> 01:01:07,094
"We have come to dedicate
a portion of that field,

1029
01:01:07,095 --> 01:01:09,472
"as a final resting place

1030
01:01:09,473 --> 01:01:15,513
"for those who here gave their
lives, that that nation might live.

1031
01:01:15,896 --> 01:01:20,358
"It is altogether fitting and
proper that we should do this.

1032
01:01:20,359 --> 01:01:26,299
"But, in a larger sense, we cannot
dedicate, we cannot consecrate,

1033
01:01:27,658 --> 01:01:30,868
"we cannot hallow,
this ground.

1034
01:01:30,994 --> 01:01:34,789
"The brave men, living and
dead, who struggled here,

1035
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:40,760
"have consecrated it far beyond
our poor power to add or detract.

1036
01:01:42,005 --> 01:01:47,093
"The world will little note, nor
long remember what we say here,

1037
01:01:47,094 --> 01:01:51,294
"but it can never forget
what they did here.

1038
01:01:52,265 --> 01:01:58,979
"It is for us the living, rather, to
be dedicated here to the unfinished work

1039
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:04,500
"which they who fought here
have thus far so nobly advanced.

1040
01:02:04,986 --> 01:02:12,284
"It is rather for us to be here dedicated
to the great task remaining before us,

1041
01:02:12,285 --> 01:02:18,457
"that from these honoured dead we
take increased devotion to that cause

1042
01:02:18,458 --> 01:02:23,170
"for which they gave the
last full measure of devotion,

1043
01:02:23,171 --> 01:02:30,041
"that we here highly resolve that these
dead shall not have died in vain...

1044
01:02:31,388 --> 01:02:37,893
"...that this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom,

1045
01:02:38,979 --> 01:02:46,777
"and that government of the people,
by the people, and for the people,

1046
01:02:47,779 --> 01:02:50,979
"shall not perish
from the earth."

1047
01:02:56,246 --> 01:02:58,289
I'll buy a drink.

1048
01:03:04,671 --> 01:03:07,548
Here's to Colonel Ruggles!

1049
01:03:07,674 --> 01:03:09,925
Here, here!

1050
01:03:10,051 --> 01:03:12,845
Well, I'll tell you, Bill,
we already got a president,

1051
01:03:12,846 --> 01:03:15,723
but any time you want to run for mayor
or sheriff or something like that,

1052
01:03:15,724 --> 01:03:16,849
you just let me know.

1053
01:03:16,850 --> 01:03:19,435
I'm not ambitious for
public office, sir.

1054
01:03:19,436 --> 01:03:23,606
Bill, what are you figuring on doing
besides standing on your own two feet?

1055
01:03:23,607 --> 01:03:27,276
I keep telling him he
should open a restaurant.

1056
01:03:27,277 --> 01:03:29,904
- Great!
- Say, that ain't a bad ideia.

1057
01:03:29,905 --> 01:03:32,823
We ain't never had a decent
hash house here in Red Gap.

1058
01:03:32,824 --> 01:03:34,909
And I'll stake you to the
best location in town for it.

1059
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:36,869
- I beg your pardon, madam?
- It won't cost you a nickel.

1060
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:38,370
I own the building.

1061
01:03:38,371 --> 01:03:42,124
There was a Chinaman tried to run a
chop suey joint there and they shot him.

1062
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:46,128
He couldn't cook ham and eggs. He was
always doin' something Chinese to 'em.

1063
01:03:46,129 --> 01:03:50,341
I could help you in the kitchen. I'll
even let you help me with my meat sauce.

1064
01:03:50,342 --> 01:03:53,219
How... how much cash you
figure it would take, Bill?

1065
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:56,096
If I might say so,
you're all a bit of OK.

1066
01:03:56,097 --> 01:03:59,308
Well, you... you're
more than that.

1067
01:03:59,309 --> 01:04:02,394
Doggone it! Let's have a
drink to the new beanery.

1068
01:04:02,395 --> 01:04:07,900
Well... well, wait a minute, wait
a minute. What... what'll we call it?

1069
01:04:07,901 --> 01:04:09,693
- Er...
- Yes.

1070
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,362
- Er...
- Um...

1071
01:04:11,488 --> 01:04:13,197
- Er...
- Er...

1072
01:04:13,323 --> 01:04:15,491
How about calling
it The Busy Bee?

1073
01:04:15,492 --> 01:04:17,451
No, no.

1074
01:04:17,577 --> 01:04:20,704
- The Mustang Grotto.
- No, no.

1075
01:04:20,831 --> 01:04:24,959
I think it should be something
nice like Ye Olde English Tavern.

1076
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,960
No, no.

1077
01:04:26,086 --> 01:04:29,630
Look, look, look. I got it, I got
it. The Golden Horse Chop House.

1078
01:04:29,631 --> 01:04:31,006
No.

1079
01:04:31,132 --> 01:04:35,344
Why? Why? Can't you just see a golden
horse squattin' up there on the roof?

1080
01:04:35,345 --> 01:04:37,137
No, no, no!

1081
01:04:37,264 --> 01:04:44,228
Er... might I suggest
The Anglo-American Grill?

1082
01:04:44,354 --> 01:04:46,063
- Um...
- Not bad, hein?

1083
01:04:46,064 --> 01:04:48,482
- I like it.
- What do you think, Egbert?

1084
01:04:48,483 --> 01:04:53,362
Well, it's all right but I still think
it ought to be called a horse's something.

1085
01:04:53,363 --> 01:04:55,406
No, no, no.

1086
01:04:58,493 --> 01:05:00,244
- Hello, Belknap.
- Effie.

1087
01:05:00,245 --> 01:05:02,079
Here's a letter from Lord
Burnstead. It just arrived this noon.

1088
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,914
Oh, dear George.

1089
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:07,585
Dear, dear George. Yes.

1090
01:05:07,711 --> 01:05:11,463
Oh! He's coming here. He's
coming here to visit us!

1091
01:05:11,464 --> 01:05:14,904
- He's coming here?
- Yes. Yes, yes.

1092
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:17,428
He's going to take
Ruggles back with him.

1093
01:05:17,429 --> 01:05:19,221
Oh.

1094
01:05:19,347 --> 01:05:22,474
The Earl of Burnstead
our house guest.

1095
01:05:22,475 --> 01:05:26,186
My supreme
triumph in Red Gap.

1096
01:05:26,313 --> 01:05:28,522
- What's the matter?
- Ruggles is gone.

1097
01:05:28,523 --> 01:05:31,442
- What?
- He's on his way to São Francisco.

1098
01:05:31,443 --> 01:05:35,404
- What are you talking about?
- I... I discharged him.

1099
01:05:35,405 --> 01:05:37,781
You discharged him? You...

1100
01:05:37,908 --> 01:05:41,243
Oh, you couldn't. You...
you... How dare you?

1101
01:05:41,244 --> 01:05:43,454
- What can we do?
- What can we do?

1102
01:05:43,455 --> 01:05:46,999
What can we do?
Oh, what can we do?

1103
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,627
What can... Oh,
I'm going to faint.

1104
01:05:49,628 --> 01:05:54,268
Oh, no. No, I'm not.
I'm going to find Egbert.

1105
01:05:58,094 --> 01:06:00,471
It's a mess, isn't it?

1106
01:06:00,472 --> 01:06:02,097
It's wonderful.

1107
01:06:02,223 --> 01:06:04,600
Well, I don't see anything
wonderful about it.

1108
01:06:04,601 --> 01:06:06,936
- You don't?
- No.

1109
01:06:07,062 --> 01:06:09,021
You don't?

1110
01:06:10,482 --> 01:06:15,611
My father was a gentleman's
gentleman, and his father before him.

1111
01:06:15,612 --> 01:06:19,865
And from that heritage of service,
miraculously, there comes a man,

1112
01:06:19,866 --> 01:06:24,203
a person of importance,
however small,

1113
01:06:24,329 --> 01:06:29,949
a man whose decisions and whose
future are in his own hands.

1114
01:06:32,128 --> 01:06:34,797
It's wonderful, isn't it?

1115
01:06:34,923 --> 01:06:38,008
Restaurant? Ruggles
opening a restaurant?

1116
01:06:38,009 --> 01:06:40,344
Yeah, where the chop
suey joint used to be.

1117
01:06:40,345 --> 01:06:43,973
Well, of course he's not going
to do anything of the sort.

1118
01:06:43,974 --> 01:06:46,725
Whoever suggested
such a horrible ideia?

1119
01:06:46,726 --> 01:06:51,188
Hey, Ma! Old man Schwartz certainly
did a good job on the suit, didn't he?

1120
01:06:51,189 --> 01:06:53,816
Oh, hello, Effie.

1121
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:02,324
Ye Gods and little
prairie dogs!

1122
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:05,995
Where in... Where did you
get that horse blanket?

1123
01:07:05,996 --> 01:07:10,207
Now, look-a-here, Effie, this is
a man's suit and I aim to wear it!

1124
01:07:10,208 --> 01:07:13,585
- Where are your good clothes?
- They're all gone.

1125
01:07:13,586 --> 01:07:16,338
Egbert Floud, take
off those clothes.

1126
01:07:16,339 --> 01:07:19,174
No, sir, I won't do it.

1127
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:22,177
- Take off those clothes!
- No, sir, I won't do it!

1128
01:07:22,178 --> 01:07:26,015
Effie, we might just as well have
a showdown right here and now.

1129
01:07:26,016 --> 01:07:29,476
What did Lincoln say at Gettysburg?
Yeah, you don't know. Well, I'll tell you.

1130
01:07:29,477 --> 01:07:32,187
He said that all men
are created equal.

1131
01:07:32,188 --> 01:07:35,858
He didn't just mean a few men. He
meant all men, and that includes me.

1132
01:07:35,859 --> 01:07:37,568
I'm created equal.

1133
01:07:37,569 --> 01:07:41,572
- Equal to what?
- Equal... equal to what?

1134
01:07:41,698 --> 01:07:44,199
Well, equal to...

1135
01:07:45,243 --> 01:07:49,371
She changed the subject on me.
Er... men are created equal to women!

1136
01:07:49,372 --> 01:07:52,875
That's why you have no right to
order me around the way you do.

1137
01:07:52,876 --> 01:07:54,418
Abe Lincoln said so.

1138
01:07:54,419 --> 01:07:56,879
He also said you can fool some
of the people some of the time,

1139
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,964
and all of the people
some of the time.

1140
01:07:58,965 --> 01:08:02,301
But you can't fool me,
Egbert Floud, any of the time!

1141
01:08:02,302 --> 01:08:04,803
You striped bass!

1142
01:08:05,847 --> 01:08:07,306
Effie!

1143
01:08:08,308 --> 01:08:10,225
Oh, no. I say, you
mustn't do that.

1144
01:08:10,226 --> 01:08:15,386
No, no, no, no. No, no.
You mustn't do that. Let me.

1145
01:08:18,651 --> 01:08:20,736
- Ruggles!
- Yes, madam?

1146
01:08:20,737 --> 01:08:25,449
Lord Burnstead. He's coming.
Here. Here's his letter.

1147
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:27,743
- Coming here, madam?
- Yes, yes. Isn't it glorious?

1148
01:08:27,744 --> 01:08:30,662
Of course, I shall be simply frantic
arranging dinners, parties and receptions

1149
01:08:30,663 --> 01:08:32,247
but I'm depending
on you, Ruggles.

1150
01:08:32,248 --> 01:08:34,792
- What are you doing? Are you busy?
- Yes, rather, madam.

1151
01:08:34,793 --> 01:08:37,294
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
The... the restaurant.

1152
01:08:37,295 --> 01:08:39,046
The chop-suey joint
you were going to open.

1153
01:08:39,047 --> 01:08:40,964
Well, of course, that's
out of the question now.

1154
01:08:40,965 --> 01:08:44,259
It was a silly ideia to begin
with. Oh, but here I am wasting time

1155
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:47,679
and... and dear George apt
to pop in on us any moment.

1156
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,641
Oh, Ruggles, you don't know
what this means to me. Au revoir!

1157
01:08:50,642 --> 01:08:53,060
Au revoir!

1158
01:09:08,034 --> 01:09:10,844
Well, he's coming to get me.

1159
01:09:13,331 --> 01:09:16,731
You're not gonna
let him, are you?

1160
01:09:17,252 --> 01:09:19,461
I suppose he needs me.

1161
01:09:19,587 --> 01:09:23,006
You mean you're gonna give up all
this just to keep him buttoned up?

1162
01:09:23,007 --> 01:09:26,135
What has he ever
done for you?

1163
01:09:26,261 --> 01:09:28,595
Well, he did let me down

1164
01:09:28,596 --> 01:09:33,559
but I'd be the first member of my
family ever to let his family down.

1165
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:34,977
And I'd have you
know, Sra. Judson,

1166
01:09:34,978 --> 01:09:38,147
that it isn't just keeping a man
buttoned up, it's heredity and loyalty,

1167
01:09:38,148 --> 01:09:40,691
and I suppose you could call
it habit if you wanted to.

1168
01:09:40,692 --> 01:09:43,277
I'd hate to tell
you what I'd call it.

1169
01:09:43,278 --> 01:09:47,489
Why don't you practise
what you been preaching?

1170
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:51,243
First I find you're not a colonel
and now I find you're not a man.

1171
01:09:51,244 --> 01:09:54,788
Maybe you'd better
find out what you are.

1172
01:09:54,789 --> 01:09:57,833
Oh, I feel like
jumping in the river.

1173
01:09:57,834 --> 01:10:00,164
Well, go ahead and jump.

1174
01:10:01,045 --> 01:10:05,275
And jump in at the
bend. It's deeper there.

1175
01:10:13,766 --> 01:10:16,977
Now, let me see. Let me see.

1176
01:10:17,103 --> 01:10:21,064
The Earl of Burnstead on my right,
of course. Er... who's next to him?

1177
01:10:21,065 --> 01:10:25,194
- Judy Ballard.
- Absolutely not. No, we'll put her...

1178
01:10:25,195 --> 01:10:27,905
Way down in the slums
at my end of the table.

1179
01:10:27,906 --> 01:10:29,698
Has anybody seen
anything of Ruggles?

1180
01:10:29,699 --> 01:10:31,200
Not a sign of him.

1181
01:10:31,201 --> 01:10:33,493
- You didn't fire him again, did you?
- I did not.

1182
01:10:33,494 --> 01:10:35,537
I looked all over town
for him, everywhere.

1183
01:10:35,538 --> 01:10:38,624
Oh, he couldn't desert me
like this in my hour of need.

1184
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:41,418
Do you realise I don't even know
how to introduce my guest of honour?

1185
01:10:41,419 --> 01:10:43,295
There's the doorbell.

1186
01:10:43,296 --> 01:10:45,464
They're arriving too early.

1187
01:10:45,465 --> 01:10:47,716
- I'll tell them.
- You'll do nothing of the sort.

1188
01:10:47,717 --> 01:10:51,053
I'll bet a dollar Lord Burnstead
hasn't got his shirt on yet.

1189
01:10:51,054 --> 01:10:53,013
Bit of a problem, isn't it?

1190
01:10:53,014 --> 01:10:54,134
Yeah, what?

1191
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:57,935
Well, we can't very well go downstairs
without our ties being tied, can we?

1192
01:10:57,936 --> 01:11:00,479
- Yeah, no, no, we can't.
- Mm.

1193
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:04,650
Maybe... maybe we can't
go downstairs at all.

1194
01:11:04,651 --> 01:11:09,363
Um... no. Beastly bores, receptions,
aren't they? Tedious, I mean.

1195
01:11:09,364 --> 01:11:12,824
- I don't like 'em, do you?
- Well, they don't bother me none.

1196
01:11:12,825 --> 01:11:14,368
- No?
- No, I never go to 'em.

1197
01:11:14,369 --> 01:11:17,955
- Oh, I see.
- I'm... I'm what they call agile.

1198
01:11:17,956 --> 01:11:19,706
Agile?

1199
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:23,794
Oh! Oh, you... you
mean agile, hein?

1200
01:11:23,795 --> 01:11:26,046
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

1201
01:11:26,047 --> 01:11:29,841
- Admiral, come here a minute.
- Yes.

1202
01:11:35,306 --> 01:11:38,308
Now, er... take a look
at this here window.

1203
01:11:38,309 --> 01:11:40,811
Looks just like an ordinary
window at first glance, doesn't it?

1204
01:11:40,812 --> 01:11:42,145
- You're right.
- Uh-hein.

1205
01:11:42,146 --> 01:11:46,900
Did you ever have occasion to,
er... climb out of a window?

1206
01:11:46,901 --> 01:11:48,527
Oh, yes. Hm.

1207
01:11:48,653 --> 01:11:52,713
- See what you can do with this one.
- Ah.

1208
01:11:54,909 --> 01:11:58,370
Oh, I hate to leave that but we
may bump into another later, hein?

1209
01:11:58,371 --> 01:12:00,998
- Take her easy, now. Take her easy.
- Yes.

1210
01:12:00,999 --> 01:12:05,836
You, er... you'll find a hole in the
wall for your foot. I put it there myself.

1211
01:12:05,837 --> 01:12:08,714
Yes. Yes, I found it.

1212
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:12,301
Come right in, girls.
Put your things down here.

1213
01:12:12,302 --> 01:12:14,386
All right, thank you.

1214
01:12:15,722 --> 01:12:18,015
Is my hair all right?

1215
01:12:18,141 --> 01:12:22,271
Yes, that's very good.
Now, how about mine?

1216
01:12:27,984 --> 01:12:31,778
- Oh, I'm sorry we were late.
- It... it's quite all right.

1217
01:12:31,779 --> 01:12:35,574
If you'll go right in, I...
I'll join you in just a moment.

1218
01:12:35,575 --> 01:12:40,785
There seems to be something
the matter with these drapes.

1219
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:47,878
? Cheyenne, Cheyenne,
hop on my pony

1220
01:12:47,879 --> 01:12:49,546
?There's room
here for two, dear

1221
01:12:49,547 --> 01:12:52,382
? But after the ceremony
We'll both ride back...

1222
01:12:52,383 --> 01:12:57,012
I hope that
wasn't the drinks.

1223
01:12:57,138 --> 01:13:00,057
- It was.
- Excuse me.

1224
01:13:03,311 --> 01:13:05,729
Oh, Miss Kenner, I'm
so sorry this happened,

1225
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:09,274
but I'm so nervous I could
jump right out of my skin.

1226
01:13:09,275 --> 01:13:11,234
Well, don't worry
about a few glasses.

1227
01:13:11,235 --> 01:13:13,487
Oh, it isn't that.
It's Sr. Ruggles.

1228
01:13:13,488 --> 01:13:16,198
I just know something's
happened to him, something fatal.

1229
01:13:16,199 --> 01:13:18,617
Oh, nonsense. He'll show up.

1230
01:13:18,618 --> 01:13:21,328
But I'm just not myself.

1231
01:13:23,122 --> 01:13:25,172
You see what I mean?

1232
01:13:32,215 --> 01:13:34,758
- Here I am. Hi, Nell.
- Why, Egbert!

1233
01:13:34,759 --> 01:13:37,010
- Where's your coat?
- Effie wanted me to wear it.

1234
01:13:37,011 --> 01:13:38,845
But I'll tell you later
how I got out of it.

1235
01:13:38,846 --> 01:13:43,100
I want you to meet somebody.
Come on in here, George.

1236
01:13:43,101 --> 01:13:45,936
Nell, I want you to meet my
poker-playing friend Earl Burnstead.

1237
01:13:45,937 --> 01:13:48,188
- How do you do?
- This is Nell Kenner.

1238
01:13:48,189 --> 01:13:50,690
- How do you do?
- Yeah, Earl is a lord.

1239
01:13:50,691 --> 01:13:53,193
Ain't that right, Lord?

1240
01:13:53,319 --> 01:13:56,071
Yeah, but you can call
him George for short.

1241
01:13:56,072 --> 01:13:59,116
And I want you two to get acquainted.
You know, Nell, make him feel at home.

1242
01:13:59,117 --> 01:14:03,078
Because he ain't quite used to our
ways, and over where he come from...

1243
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:06,706
Er... Oh, heck. I guess
it's the same the world over.

1244
01:14:06,707 --> 01:14:09,177
Give me a drink, somebody.

1245
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:12,462
Er... this is a frightful
intrusion, isn't it?

1246
01:14:12,463 --> 01:14:16,049
Oh, not at all. Isn't Sra. Floud
giving you a dinner tonight?

1247
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:17,884
Yes. Oh, yes.

1248
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:20,512
Oh, I... I see your point.

1249
01:14:20,513 --> 01:14:22,681
Well, you see, I...

1250
01:14:22,807 --> 01:14:26,017
Well, you can see for
yourself my tie isn't right.

1251
01:14:26,018 --> 01:14:28,979
Oh, isn't that too bad?
Shall I tie it for you?

1252
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:30,981
- Oh, I say, would you really?
- Of course.

1253
01:14:30,982 --> 01:14:33,692
Oh, I say, isn't this nice?

1254
01:14:33,693 --> 01:14:38,453
Is this your first visit
to America, Lord Burnstead?

1255
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:42,451
Hein? Oh, I'm so sorry. I was
thinking of something else. I...

1256
01:14:42,452 --> 01:14:45,620
You're remarkably like a girl I
know. I can't remember her name.

1257
01:14:45,621 --> 01:14:47,414
- Hm?
- Yes. You don't know it, I suppose?

1258
01:14:47,415 --> 01:14:49,374
- No.
- No, I suppose not.

1259
01:14:49,375 --> 01:14:52,002
She's... she's the most
beautiful girl in England.

1260
01:14:52,003 --> 01:14:53,587
There.

1261
01:14:53,713 --> 01:14:55,755
I'm afraid that's
the best I can do.

1262
01:14:55,756 --> 01:14:59,092
Oh, it's first-rate,
really. Thanks awfully.

1263
01:14:59,093 --> 01:15:02,512
I say, do... do you believe
in love at first sight?

1264
01:15:02,513 --> 01:15:03,638
- No.
- No?

1265
01:15:03,639 --> 01:15:05,474
- Do you?
- No.

1266
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,018
That's why I'd like to stay
a little while, if I may.

1267
01:15:08,019 --> 01:15:10,854
- What?
- Come on in.

1268
01:15:14,275 --> 01:15:15,942
Fascinating, your
American rhythm, isn't it?

1269
01:15:15,943 --> 01:15:17,819
Yes, isn't it?

1270
01:15:17,945 --> 01:15:19,738
It's ready.

1271
01:15:19,864 --> 01:15:21,406
Oh. Shall we eat?

1272
01:15:21,407 --> 01:15:23,658
Er... no, I'd rather try
this again, if you don't mind.

1273
01:15:23,659 --> 01:15:25,243
- All right.
- Yes.

1274
01:15:25,244 --> 01:15:29,664
? Everybody loves a baby
That's why I'm in love with you

1275
01:15:29,665 --> 01:15:31,583
? Pretty baby, boom...

1276
01:15:31,584 --> 01:15:33,418
- Why did you say boom?
- There's a boom there.

1277
01:15:33,419 --> 01:15:36,755
- Oh, is there? Oh.
- You don't seem to understand.

1278
01:15:36,756 --> 01:15:38,173
- Say it once with me.
- Yes.

1279
01:15:38,174 --> 01:15:40,717
Everybody loves a baby, that's
why I'm in love with you.

1280
01:15:40,718 --> 01:15:42,886
Pretty baby, boom.
Pretty baby, boom.

1281
01:15:42,887 --> 01:15:44,387
- That's right.
- I see. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

1282
01:15:44,388 --> 01:15:48,683
? Everybody loves a baby
That's why I'm in love with you

1283
01:15:48,684 --> 01:15:51,094
- ? Pretty baby
- ? Boom...

1284
01:15:51,395 --> 01:15:53,730
No, you do it on the drum.

1285
01:15:53,731 --> 01:15:55,899
Hein? Of course.
How stupid of me.

1286
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:57,317
- Yes.
- Hein?

1287
01:15:57,443 --> 01:15:59,945
? Everybody loves a baby

1288
01:16:00,071 --> 01:16:02,989
?That's why I'm in love
with you Pretty baby...

1289
01:16:02,990 --> 01:16:05,784
? Pretty baby...

1290
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:07,285
- I'm sorry.
- What?

1291
01:16:07,286 --> 01:16:10,163
- There's another one there.
- Oh. Oh, a ditto?

1292
01:16:10,164 --> 01:16:12,332
- Yes, a ditto boom.
- Oh, I like that.

1293
01:16:12,333 --> 01:16:14,417
- You like what?
- A ditto boom.

1294
01:16:14,418 --> 01:16:16,211
Ditto boom. Ditto boom.
Ditto boom, boom, boom.

1295
01:16:16,212 --> 01:16:17,671
Oh, let's eat.

1296
01:16:17,672 --> 01:16:19,798
What? No, I'd rather ditto
boom, if you don't mind.

1297
01:16:19,799 --> 01:16:23,927
- All right, we'll ditto boom.
- That's fine, that's fine.

1298
01:16:23,928 --> 01:16:28,306
? Everybody loves a baby
That's why I'm in love with you

1299
01:16:28,307 --> 01:16:32,394
? Pretty baby...

1300
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:37,315
? I'd like to be your sister, brother
Dad and mother too, pretty baby...

1301
01:16:37,316 --> 01:16:38,567
Popping in everywhere.

1302
01:16:38,568 --> 01:16:40,068
? Pretty baby...

1303
01:16:40,194 --> 01:16:43,196
?Won't you come and let me
rock you In my cradle of love...

1304
01:16:43,197 --> 01:16:45,240
That was my own ideia.

1305
01:16:45,241 --> 01:16:47,576
I know it.

1306
01:16:47,702 --> 01:16:52,205
? Oh, I want a lovin' baby
And it might as well be you...

1307
01:16:52,206 --> 01:16:55,750
- Oh, would that be asking too much?
- Why, of course not, no.

1308
01:16:55,751 --> 01:16:59,361
- I mean two booms.
- Oh, I see. Yes.

1309
01:16:59,547 --> 01:17:04,801
? Oh, I want a lovin' baby
And it might as well be you...

1310
01:17:04,802 --> 01:17:06,428
Oh.

1311
01:17:09,557 --> 01:17:12,392
Oh, was that your drum?

1312
01:17:12,518 --> 01:17:15,520
You couldn't sew it
up, I don't suppose?

1313
01:17:15,521 --> 01:17:18,023
No. Oh.

1314
01:17:18,149 --> 01:17:22,619
Buy a new one, will
you? Buy two, one for me.

1315
01:17:23,237 --> 01:17:27,782
I'm sure Lord Burnstead will forgive
us for not waiting for him any longer.

1316
01:17:27,783 --> 01:17:29,326
He'll join us, I know,

1317
01:17:29,327 --> 01:17:33,330
just as soon as he's finished
his conversation on the telephone,

1318
01:17:33,331 --> 01:17:36,374
which I'm sure must
be terribly important.

1319
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:39,586
Possibly a... a
message from the King

1320
01:17:39,587 --> 01:17:43,298
or possibly from the,
er... Mayor of Canadá.

1321
01:17:43,299 --> 01:17:45,800
Er... possibly.

1322
01:17:45,926 --> 01:17:48,094
Well, shall we begin?

1323
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:50,138
Why not?

1324
01:17:50,264 --> 01:17:52,057
Go on, pitch in.

1325
01:17:55,603 --> 01:17:58,938
You come on in here where you
can't spill drinks all over me.

1326
01:17:58,939 --> 01:18:00,982
Oh, I'm so sorry but
I'm just not myself.

1327
01:18:00,983 --> 01:18:03,485
Now, you sit down and tell
me what's the matter. Come on.

1328
01:18:03,486 --> 01:18:06,404
Oh, I don't see how they
can go on having a good time

1329
01:18:06,405 --> 01:18:08,698
when maybe he's...
Oh, you know.

1330
01:18:08,699 --> 01:18:11,785
- Who? What are you talking about?
- Colonel Ruggles.

1331
01:18:11,786 --> 01:18:13,620
I think he jumped
in the river.

1332
01:18:13,621 --> 01:18:15,914
No! Why should he
want to do that?

1333
01:18:15,915 --> 01:18:19,542
Oh, on account of a woman. She
treated him something awful.

1334
01:18:19,543 --> 01:18:21,628
- Who told you that?
- I was there.

1335
01:18:21,629 --> 01:18:25,006
Oh, she said some terrible things
to him and I just know that...

1336
01:18:25,007 --> 01:18:27,676
- Why, say, this is serious!
- That's what I say.

1337
01:18:27,677 --> 01:18:29,386
Well, we gotta get
busy right away.

1338
01:18:29,387 --> 01:18:31,763
- Oh, will you?
- Well, yes, I'll round up the boys.

1339
01:18:31,764 --> 01:18:34,057
Hey, fellers,
look-a-here!

1340
01:18:34,058 --> 01:18:37,310
Get on your hats and coats.
I got something for you to do.

1341
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:41,481
- It is a ghost! Oh, you didn't do it!
- Colonel Ruggles is missin'!

1342
01:18:41,482 --> 01:18:43,775
Follow me. We'll get
going right away. I...

1343
01:18:43,776 --> 01:18:46,319
Er... well, the
searching party's off.

1344
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:50,031
Look-a-here, Bill, what's the ideia
of wanderin' around scarin' women?

1345
01:18:50,032 --> 01:18:54,077
I thought the Indians had got
you, Ruggles. Glad to see you.

1346
01:18:54,078 --> 01:18:57,122
I am glad to
see you, my lord.

1347
01:18:57,123 --> 01:18:59,499
I'm sorry I wasn't at the
station to meet you, my lord.

1348
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,667
That's all right.

1349
01:19:00,668 --> 01:19:03,837
Er... might I have a word
with you alone, my lord?

1350
01:19:03,838 --> 01:19:05,547
Why, I should
think so. Why not?

1351
01:19:05,548 --> 01:19:07,799
Come on, old timer,
let's leave them alone.

1352
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,884
- I don't understand.
- Get them a drink.

1353
01:19:09,885 --> 01:19:13,012
She tells me he's in the
river and he ain't even wet.

1354
01:19:13,013 --> 01:19:15,014
Something wrong, Ruggles?

1355
01:19:15,015 --> 01:19:17,684
I've had a terrible day, my
lord, a... a terrific fight.

1356
01:19:17,685 --> 01:19:20,311
- Oh. Were you outnumbered?
- An even match, my lord.

1357
01:19:20,312 --> 01:19:23,523
- A woman?
- No, my lord. I was fighting with myself.

1358
01:19:23,524 --> 01:19:25,984
- Did you win?
- A decisive victory, my lord.

1359
01:19:25,985 --> 01:19:29,696
Oh, stout feller! I didn't
think you had it in you.

1360
01:19:29,697 --> 01:19:32,949
Er... you'll find me rather
a changed man, my lord.

1361
01:19:32,950 --> 01:19:35,410
I don't know quite
how to tell you

1362
01:19:35,411 --> 01:19:38,204
but here in Red Gap I
am considered important.

1363
01:19:38,205 --> 01:19:40,540
Quite a personage.

1364
01:19:40,666 --> 01:19:42,709
Yes, Colonel
Ruggles, isn't it?

1365
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:46,337
Yes, my lord. Colonel Marmaduke
Ruggles of the Coldstream Guards.

1366
01:19:46,338 --> 01:19:49,257
- A horrible mistake, my lord.
- Quite, if there should be a war.

1367
01:19:49,258 --> 01:19:50,842
Yes.

1368
01:19:52,136 --> 01:19:53,887
Nevertheless, my lord,

1369
01:19:53,888 --> 01:19:58,475
when people think you are someone,
you begin to think you are.

1370
01:19:58,476 --> 01:20:01,978
That's what I've been fighting
about with myself all day, my lord.

1371
01:20:01,979 --> 01:20:04,105
Am I someone or am I not?

1372
01:20:04,106 --> 01:20:06,733
Well, I only just got here,
you see, so I wouldn't know.

1373
01:20:06,734 --> 01:20:09,110
Oh, I am someone, my lord.

1374
01:20:09,111 --> 01:20:12,238
Oh, let me be the first to congratulate
you. How did you ever find it out?

1375
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:16,034
Ah. You recollect an
Abraham Lincoln, my lord?

1376
01:20:16,035 --> 01:20:18,703
Oh, yes, fellow
with the cherry tree.

1377
01:20:18,704 --> 01:20:21,164
- Er... no, my lord.
- Er... no?

1378
01:20:21,165 --> 01:20:24,667
At any rate, my lord, I am
genuinely sorry to have to tell you

1379
01:20:24,668 --> 01:20:28,963
that I shall not be returning with you
to London, I am remaining in Red Gap.

1380
01:20:28,964 --> 01:20:30,340
Oh, now, wait a
minute, Ruggles.

1381
01:20:30,341 --> 01:20:33,593
It's no use, my lord.
My mind is made up.

1382
01:20:33,594 --> 01:20:36,262
I am entering trade,
my lord, a restaurant.

1383
01:20:36,263 --> 01:20:40,350
Oh, it's no good for you, Ruggles. You
haven't got the background for trade.

1384
01:20:40,351 --> 01:20:44,229
Nevertheless, my
lord, I intend to try.

1385
01:20:44,355 --> 01:20:47,398
Oh, I never knew you to be
so obstinate before, really.

1386
01:20:47,399 --> 01:20:50,193
Still, something tells me
that we'll be back in London.

1387
01:20:50,194 --> 01:20:54,674
- Oh, excuse me. Here are your drinks.
- Oh. Hm.

1388
01:20:56,659 --> 01:20:58,919
Well, here's to London.

1389
01:20:59,870 --> 01:21:02,664
Here is to The
Anglo-American Grill, my lord.

1390
01:21:02,665 --> 01:21:04,415
Ha-ha. Yes.

1391
01:21:24,603 --> 01:21:26,229
Oh!

1392
01:21:27,523 --> 01:21:31,359
Mm, we should be all
right. Ready in ten minutes.

1393
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,529
- Oh, they love your meat sauce.
- You mean our meat sauce.

1394
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:37,156
Because I added a few drops of
this and a little bit of that.

1395
01:21:37,157 --> 01:21:38,533
Did you?

1396
01:21:47,084 --> 01:21:50,712
- Colonel, are we dressed all right?
- Indeed, yes, sir.

1397
01:21:50,713 --> 01:21:52,547
Table for four.

1398
01:21:52,673 --> 01:21:55,383
Thank you. Hello.

1399
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,348
- Hello, Egbert!
- Hello, George!

1400
01:22:02,349 --> 01:22:05,935
- You remember Effie, boys.
- Howdy, Effie!

1401
01:22:05,936 --> 01:22:09,826
Make way for a lady,
you laughing hyenas!

1402
01:22:10,274 --> 01:22:12,859
You're losing
your petticoat, Ma!

1403
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:14,944
Hey, Sourdough, where
did you get the lid?

1404
01:22:14,945 --> 01:22:18,525
From Paris, France!
Ain't it terrible?

1405
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:25,720
Hold onto that hat.
It cost me 20 dollars.

1406
01:22:25,956 --> 01:22:28,396
Hello, Maude. Hello, Frank.

1407
01:22:29,084 --> 01:22:31,419
- Hello... why, hello, Fred!
- Howdy, Sourdough.

1408
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:33,922
- How's everything? Hello, Soph.
- How are you?

1409
01:22:33,923 --> 01:22:38,051
Well, Bill, you're kinda
dressed up, ain't you?

1410
01:22:38,052 --> 01:22:42,182
Hello, Bill. Where do
you want us to squat?

1411
01:22:42,389 --> 01:22:45,475
Heh-heh. Yeah, ain't Bill
movin' around, though, hein?

1412
01:22:45,476 --> 01:22:48,227
Oh, Effie, where
is Lord Burnstead?

1413
01:22:48,228 --> 01:22:51,606
He must have been delayed.
He's a very busy man, you know.

1414
01:22:51,607 --> 01:22:53,358
- Ruggles.
- Yes, madam?

1415
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:54,901
Where's Lord Burnstead?

1416
01:22:54,902 --> 01:22:56,736
I understood he was
coming with you, madam.

1417
01:22:56,737 --> 01:23:01,032
He was but he didn't.
I can't understand it.

1418
01:23:01,033 --> 01:23:04,160
Lord Burnstead probably didn't
care to come to a place like this.

1419
01:23:04,161 --> 01:23:08,998
A nice party this is going to
be, without our guest of honour.

1420
01:23:08,999 --> 01:23:10,792
You don't know where
George is, do you?

1421
01:23:10,793 --> 01:23:12,961
- Who, George?
- Shh.

1422
01:23:13,087 --> 01:23:17,007
George? No, I ain't
seen George all day.

1423
01:23:18,008 --> 01:23:20,268
No, the left-hand side.

1424
01:23:32,189 --> 01:23:38,119
Look-a-here, Effie, you're taking
this thing too much to heart.

1425
01:23:41,407 --> 01:23:44,947
Try a little of
our meat sauce, sir.

1426
01:23:48,455 --> 01:23:50,498
Haven't you any catsup?

1427
01:23:50,499 --> 01:23:54,589
Oh, never mind. I'll
eat when I get home.

1428
01:23:55,462 --> 01:23:58,423
What you want is...
what you want is... is...

1429
01:23:58,424 --> 01:24:03,094
some more of this imprisoned laughter
of the pleasant maids of France.

1430
01:24:03,095 --> 01:24:05,430
- What's wrong now?
- Nothing wrong with the food.

1431
01:24:05,431 --> 01:24:06,681
What happened?

1432
01:24:06,682 --> 01:24:10,768
I suppose it's wrong to hate anybody,
but I dislike Belknap-Jackson very much.

1433
01:24:10,769 --> 01:24:12,729
I'm gonna get you
something for your nerves.

1434
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:14,814
- No, my nerves are quite all right.
- Oh, but I am.

1435
01:24:14,815 --> 01:24:16,941
No, I'm all right.

1436
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:24,866
Oh, Effie? Where can
Lord Burnstead be?

1437
01:24:24,992 --> 01:24:30,562
I told you he's a very busy
man. He's a man of affairs.

1438
01:24:31,957 --> 01:24:36,157
- Have a good time.
- Thanks a lot, old man.

1439
01:24:36,462 --> 01:24:38,588
Oh, Effie?

1440
01:24:47,765 --> 01:24:49,724
- Hi, Nell!
- Hello, Egbert!

1441
01:24:49,725 --> 01:24:53,519
Hello, Nell! Well, Admiral!
Say, where have you been?

1442
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:57,231
- Effie's been looking for you.
- Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

1443
01:24:57,232 --> 01:25:00,443
- Dear, oh, dear! I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, sit down, sit down, Bill.

1444
01:25:00,444 --> 01:25:02,862
- I have no excuse at all.
- No?

1445
01:25:02,863 --> 01:25:05,740
No. It... it must have been
the excitement, probably.

1446
01:25:05,741 --> 01:25:07,200
- Excitement?
- Yes.

1447
01:25:07,201 --> 01:25:09,327
Do you believe in
love at first sight?

1448
01:25:09,328 --> 01:25:11,658
- Oh, no, no.
- No, no.

1449
01:25:11,705 --> 01:25:14,373
Neither did we but, er...
Darling, just a minute.

1450
01:25:14,374 --> 01:25:17,627
I mean, look. You see?

1451
01:25:17,753 --> 01:25:20,254
Well, you old mossback, you.

1452
01:25:20,255 --> 01:25:21,839
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, old boy.

1453
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,717
What's the matter with you,
Nell? You been losing your mind?

1454
01:25:24,718 --> 01:25:28,262
- She's going to be my countess.
- She's going to be a countess!

1455
01:25:28,263 --> 01:25:31,307
- Sit down, won't you? Come on!
- Yeah, Bill, let's have another chair.

1456
01:25:31,308 --> 01:25:34,811
Sit right down here, Admiral. And,
Nell, you sit right next to him there.

1457
01:25:34,812 --> 01:25:36,395
This is gonna be my party

1458
01:25:36,396 --> 01:25:40,441
on account of my knowing
Nell longer than anybody here.

1459
01:25:40,442 --> 01:25:42,068
- Oh, Egbert?
- Yes.

1460
01:25:42,069 --> 01:25:44,195
Egbert, I'm going to
be matron of honour

1461
01:25:44,196 --> 01:25:46,239
and we're gonna have
the wedding at our house.

1462
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:48,640
- Oh, sure.
- Aren't we?

1463
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:50,868
Oh!

1464
01:25:50,994 --> 01:25:54,997
Making a countess
of a cheap dancer!

1465
01:25:55,124 --> 01:25:58,417
I wouldn't say that
if I were you, sir.

1466
01:25:58,418 --> 01:26:01,254
- You what?
- I wouldn't say that if I were you, sir.

1467
01:26:01,255 --> 01:26:02,755
You're insulting, Ruggles.

1468
01:26:02,756 --> 01:26:04,757
I beg your pardon, but
you were insulting, sir.

1469
01:26:04,758 --> 01:26:07,135
Not only were you insulting
but you were eavesdropping.

1470
01:26:07,136 --> 01:26:10,138
- That was quite unintentional, sir.
- You're lying, Ruggles.

1471
01:26:10,139 --> 01:26:13,015
- I wouldn't say that if I were you, sir.
- I've stood enough from you.

1472
01:26:13,016 --> 01:26:16,144
Aren't you forgetting that you are
nothing but a low, common shiner of boots?

1473
01:26:16,145 --> 01:26:17,937
I'm not forgetting that I
am proprietor of this place

1474
01:26:17,938 --> 01:26:22,108
and as proprietor of this place I
am politely asking you to leave, sir.

1475
01:26:22,109 --> 01:26:24,402
- You what?
- I'm asking you to leave.

1476
01:26:24,403 --> 01:26:28,197
If I go, all the real
people will leave with me.

1477
01:26:28,198 --> 01:26:31,868
If my success depends upon
catering to people like you, sir,

1478
01:26:31,869 --> 01:26:35,413
all I can say is... all I can
say is, Sr. Belknap-Jackson...

1479
01:26:35,414 --> 01:26:37,707
all I can say
is words fail me.

1480
01:26:37,708 --> 01:26:40,751
- Ruggles! How dare you?
- It's quite all right, sir.

1481
01:26:40,752 --> 01:26:46,782
- You can't... you can't do this to me!
- Quite all right, sir.

1482
01:26:51,972 --> 01:26:55,452
- This is disgraceful.
- Oh, sit down.

1483
01:27:05,861 --> 01:27:08,237
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd
like to say a few words to you

1484
01:27:08,238 --> 01:27:11,268
about the proprietor
Sr. Ruggles.

1485
01:27:13,827 --> 01:27:17,580
- So, I'm a failure?
- Oh, don't worry about it.

1486
01:27:17,581 --> 01:27:21,709
As I always say, it's always
darkest before the dawn

1487
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:26,839
and every cloud has a silver lining
and it never rains but what...

1488
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,549
Oh.

1489
01:27:29,801 --> 01:27:35,890
- And I'm not worrying about it.
- Oh, yes, you are. Just look at you.

1490
01:27:35,891 --> 01:27:38,601
? For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow...

1491
01:27:38,602 --> 01:27:41,103
Well, they seem to
love His Lordship.

1492
01:27:41,104 --> 01:27:45,983
His Lordship's a very happy man
tonight. He's marrying Nell Kenner. Yeah.

1493
01:27:45,984 --> 01:27:49,445
Hey! Hey, Bill! Bill, come on,
get in on this, will you? Come on.

1494
01:27:49,446 --> 01:27:52,782
Heh-heh! This is the biggest
show Red Gap ever had.

1495
01:27:52,783 --> 01:27:57,828
? He's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

1496
01:27:57,829 --> 01:27:59,914

?Which nobody can deny
Which nobody can deny...

1498
01:28:08,715 --> 01:28:12,009
Why, you old plate of soup,
they're singing it for you!

1499
01:28:12,010 --> 01:28:14,804
What?

1500
01:28:26,108 --> 01:28:28,067
My friends.

1501
01:28:30,612 --> 01:28:31,988
God bless you all.
