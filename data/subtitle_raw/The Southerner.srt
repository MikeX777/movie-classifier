1
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:20,030
This is a little souvenir...
picture of my best pal...

2
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,010
Sam Tucker and his folks

3
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,962
Believe me, they don't come no better...

4
00:01:24,062 --> 00:01:27,077
Only, when old Sam gets an idea
in that hard head of his...

5
00:01:27,277 --> 00:01:29,404
he don't behoove with nothin' else.

6
00:01:30,203 --> 00:01:31,294
This is Nona...

7
00:01:31,394 --> 00:01:32,767
Sam's wife.

8
00:01:33,814 --> 00:01:36,021
And here's Sam's ma... a widow-woman

9
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,890
Ma ain't so young...
but her heart's still full of fire.

10
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:43,220
Harmie here ain't no Tucker...
just a good friend.

11
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,393
If he looks kinda
sheep-eyed, it's because

12
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:47,683
he's all lit up with that
flame in Ma's heart.

13
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:50,004
These are the youngest
of the Tucker clan.

14
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:53,159
Sam's kids... Daisy and Jotty.

15
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,125
And here's Sam's granny.

16
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:57,598
She didn't like having her
picture took, neither.

17
00:01:58,357 --> 00:02:01,396
This one's me...
I'm a town man myself.

18
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:04,180
Only come home for fairs
and weddings and stuff.

19
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,002
That's how come I cherish
this picture show...

20
00:02:07,102 --> 00:02:09,988
Makes me feel close to my friends,
to look at it.

21
00:02:51,524 --> 00:02:54,826
Sam... Sam...

22
00:02:56,204 --> 00:02:57,603
What's the matter, Uncle Pete?

23
00:02:57,703 --> 00:03:00,059
- It's all so hot!
- Hey, Nona!

24
00:03:21,323 --> 00:03:22,269
My hat...

25
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:26,447
You lie here, Uncle Pete...

26
00:03:26,547 --> 00:03:27,564
Get some water.

27
00:03:27,664 --> 00:03:29,919
It's my darned old heart.

28
00:03:37,221 --> 00:03:39,820
You just lie here, Uncle Pete...
I'll finish your row for you.

29
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,007
Much obliged to you, Sam.

30
00:03:43,102 --> 00:03:44,281
I gotta take my cotton back,
now, Honey.

31
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:45,585
I'll take care of Uncle Pete.

32
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:12,485
Uncle Pete's sick,
I'm gonna finish his row.

33
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,099
Where are you going
after the crop's over?

34
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:29,503
I figured I might stay here...
I got me a bulldozing job.

35
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,132
- Where are you going?
- I think I'm going north next year.

36
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,795
- Can I sit down?
- Hi fellas.

37
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:38,243
- Hot.
- Yeah.

38
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:57,276
How is he, Honey?

39
00:04:59,204 --> 00:05:00,654
He ain't so good.

40
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:04,400
Look for yourself...

41
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:08,650
Grow your own crops.

42
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,557
You want some more water, Uncle Pete?

43
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,010
Grow your own crops.

44
00:05:44,451 --> 00:05:46,969
I wish we could raise him
a tombstone.

45
00:05:47,907 --> 00:05:49,697
That's for folks that got money.

46
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:55,409
Come here, "Zoomy".

47
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:04,648
Jotty...

48
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,810
My eyes hurt!

49
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,014
Oh, does it, Jotty?

50
00:06:45,194 --> 00:06:46,955
Granny!... Granny!

51
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:50,286
Here, Honey... hold him.

52
00:06:50,772 --> 00:06:52,637
Look at the fast grapes!

53
00:06:56,788 --> 00:06:58,696
Don't you want any fast grapes, Granny?

54
00:06:58,796 --> 00:07:01,436
I don't want to get mixed up
with no copperheads!

55
00:07:01,536 --> 00:07:04,787
Already wearin' one crooky toe
on o' them scoundrels ruined!

56
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:19,463
Don't be a hog, Daisy...
Leave a few for the next fella!

57
00:07:19,563 --> 00:07:21,507
I thought you was afeard of snakes!

58
00:07:21,794 --> 00:07:26,028
I am... but that ain't no sign
I got to starve to death, is it?

59
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:29,317
You know that little San Pedro place
down near the river?

60
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:31,168
I heard of it... I ain't never seen it.

61
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:32,931
Well, that belongs to the boss, too.

62
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:35,525
Old Ike at the commissary
was tellin' me it was for rent.

63
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,259
Been layin' out there now
for three years...

64
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:39,141
It should be as rich as mud.

65
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:42,714
In the old days, old man Corinth used to
raise the best crops in the country on it.

66
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:46,825
If it's been layin' out all that time,
it'll take a whole year to clear it off.

67
00:07:46,852 --> 00:07:47,997
Yeah.

68
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:57,640
Nony... Nony come here!

69
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:06,493
Behave yourself...
Don't you be always teasin' Granny.

70
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:11,215
I reckon I could ask old man Neward
for his mules...

71
00:08:11,315 --> 00:08:12,785
He don't ever hardly use 'em,
no how.

72
00:08:13,096 --> 00:08:14,479
Same with the bed of the crop.

73
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:18,304
As for seeds and fertilizer...
I bet I could make a deal with Harmie.

74
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:21,351
And as for a plough,
there's that old one of Pa's...

75
00:08:21,451 --> 00:08:23,684
been layin' out in Ma's backyard
ever since he died...

76
00:08:23,784 --> 00:08:25,863
Ain't been used for nothin'
but roostin' chickens on.

77
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:28,474
I'm gonna ask the boss about it.

78
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,508
Askin' don't do no harm.

79
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:33,262
No askin'... or work either...
don't harm a man.

80
00:08:34,053 --> 00:08:36,523
After all, the boss
is a pretty good guy.

81
00:08:36,623 --> 00:08:38,098
We always been friends.

82
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:43,770
Jotty, Dis, Granny... come on!

83
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:06,714
It's OK with me, Tucker...
I ain't interested in that piece o' land.

84
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,256
Too far away from my other property.

85
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:10,767
But just remember this...

86
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,296
If I ain't satisfied
with the way you're workin' it...

87
00:09:14,396 --> 00:09:17,697
I aim to break that contract
any time I like.

88
00:09:20,134 --> 00:09:21,692
It's alright with me, boss.

89
00:09:23,137 --> 00:09:24,208
I like you, Tucker.

90
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:25,789
You're a good hard-worker.

91
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,977
And that's why I'm botherin' to warn you...

92
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:29,613
Now, I'm tellin' you again...

93
00:09:29,713 --> 00:09:31,867
If you're workin' for a big outfit...

94
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:33,453
Maybe you don't get rich...

95
00:09:34,203 --> 00:09:37,065
But you still get your pay...
even if the crops is bad.

96
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:39,905
But the little guy,
who's growin' his own...

97
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:42,302
If his crop is ruined...

98
00:09:42,402 --> 00:09:43,848
He's got nothin' left.

99
00:09:45,272 --> 00:09:47,388
I see you've made up your mind.

100
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:49,179
Got some way of movin' your things?

101
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:51,026
Yessir... Coreo said I
could borrow his truck.

102
00:09:51,027 --> 00:09:53,026
OK... Good luck, Tucker!

103
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:53,823
Thank you, sir.

104
00:10:19,678 --> 00:10:22,240
How far is our house
from the river, Papa?

105
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:24,526
Why, it's almost just right next
to the river, Honey!

106
00:10:24,527 --> 00:10:26,614
Goody... goody!

107
00:10:53,406 --> 00:10:56,671
Don't look like no house
at all to me.

108
00:10:58,126 --> 00:11:00,455
Looks more like a cow shed!

109
00:11:00,456 --> 00:11:05,406
I'd rather live back there in that dirty
old camp than a heap o' junk like that!

110
00:11:07,006 --> 00:11:10,477
Ain't never gonna get me
to go into that old tin hole

111
00:11:11,677 --> 00:11:14,783
Bringin' their old granny
to this scrubby place!

112
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:18,304
I see they don't love me no more
than if I was a yellow dog!

113
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:22,806
I always hoped we could have a room
to ourselves, some day.

114
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,021
We can have... when summer comes.

115
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:30,227
Let Granny and the kids sleep in here...
and move our bed out on the porch.

116
00:11:30,228 --> 00:11:32,894
And have everything real nice.

117
00:11:33,763 --> 00:11:35,000
Oh, Sam...

118
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:38,610
The house don't seem
like nothin' extra!

119
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:41,428
Seems like extra one thing...

120
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:43,097
Pretty darn extra bad.

121
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:45,968
I reckon I was thinkin' too hard
about the land...

122
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:47,879
I plum forgot about the house.

123
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:51,356
There sure be some patchin' to do.

124
00:11:52,359 --> 00:11:53,501
More 'n a little!

125
00:11:57,812 --> 00:11:59,559
What about the well, Sam?

126
00:12:00,525 --> 00:12:01,484
Let's go look at it.

127
00:12:03,295 --> 00:12:06,185
I was crazy to think
we could live in this place.

128
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:09,842
Why, it'd take me at least 2 weeks
to dig this well again.

129
00:12:09,843 --> 00:12:13,634
Without even talkin' about the
money the planks and beams w'd cost!

130
00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:18,375
Tain't much of a man that brings
his babies and his womenfolks

131
00:12:18,376 --> 00:12:21,340
to soak and freeze...
in such a hole as this!

132
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:27,218
Maybe she's right.

133
00:12:27,219 --> 00:12:29,366
Water from that river,
for the kids...

134
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:32,206
'd just be like servin' them up
a dish of typhoid.

135
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:35,300
Tain't much of a man, I say!

136
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:40,770
Look, Honey... we can still
go back to the camp, if you want to.

137
00:12:41,395 --> 00:12:43,449
The boss couldn't have knowed
how bad the place is.

138
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,746
I could talk to him again, and still maybe
get my bulldozing job for the winter.

139
00:12:49,276 --> 00:12:50,321
Well...

140
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,519
How's the ground?

141
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:54,526
Oh, it's good earth alright...

142
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:58,344
You know, with dirt like this, a fella
could raise the best crop in the country.

143
00:12:58,345 --> 00:12:59,975
Been layin' out all these years.

144
00:13:00,742 --> 00:13:03,835
The earth's kinda like men, you know...
It needs a rest every once in a while.

145
00:13:03,836 --> 00:13:06,495
Maybe that's the reason
the Lord invented Sunday.

146
00:13:06,496 --> 00:13:08,595
But how about all this brush
and Johnson grass?

147
00:13:08,596 --> 00:13:11,160
You'll kill yourself gettin' rid of it
before the plantin'.

148
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:13,380
I ain't all alone Honey...
I ain't like Uncle Pete.

149
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:17,283
Every time i get plum wore out...
I think of you and Jotty and Daisy...

150
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,531
And I ain't quite so tired anymore.

151
00:13:19,664 --> 00:13:20,763
Oh, Sam!

152
00:13:20,864 --> 00:13:23,350
I just could never get along
without you.

153
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:25,871
Me too, Honey...
I couldn't live without you.

154
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,603
The thing that'd be good about it is
we could always work together.

155
00:13:29,604 --> 00:13:32,208
When you did the ploughin'
I could lead the mules... and...

156
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:35,811
When you clean up this brush,
I could burn it for you... and...

157
00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:39,161
Summertime we could lie in the grass
and watch the kids swimmin' in the river.

158
00:13:39,162 --> 00:13:40,321
Yeah... that'd be fun, Honey!

159
00:13:41,326 --> 00:13:43,620
But what worries me
is that busted well.

160
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,940
Oh, Sam... we could surely borrow water
from the neighbour, yonder...

161
00:13:46,941 --> 00:13:48,555
Nobody refuses water.

162
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:51,038
Yeah... I hear he's got a good well.

163
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:54,883
Sam... I reckon we ought to stay!

164
00:13:56,572 --> 00:13:57,430
You really mean that?

165
00:13:57,431 --> 00:13:59,618
You ain't just sayin' that
to make me feel good?

166
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:01,854
I'm sayin' it because I believe
you're as good as any man...

167
00:14:01,855 --> 00:14:04,400
and it's right for you
to be your own boss.

168
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:10,665
Hey, you two...
You ain't all alone here, you know!

169
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:19,398
Hey there... we've got enough... we're
moving in and it's all ironed... come on.

170
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:21,331
Come on... give me a hand.

171
00:14:24,832 --> 00:14:28,212
You take the pictures...
mind you don't drop 'em.

172
00:14:33,867 --> 00:14:35,663
Come on sweetie...
I'll help you down

173
00:14:35,664 --> 00:14:36,573
No you don't!

174
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:41,084
I don't want aim to go no...

175
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:46,922
Can't even say it...
me I'm a lady.

176
00:14:46,923 --> 00:14:49,456
Alright old lady...
but you better be down before morning...

177
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:51,324
or you'll go right back to camp
with this truck.

178
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:53,611
Old man Coreo mightn't
like it too much, neither.

179
00:14:59,846 --> 00:15:04,027
Sam Tucker! My own grandson
gone as crazy as a bedbug!

180
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,183
Total crazy I tell you!

181
00:15:06,184 --> 00:15:08,566
Crazy as a bedbug!

182
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:11,293
You've gone completely silly!

183
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:16,815
He's clean outta his mind,
I tell ya!

184
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:43,747
There's so much...
You're downright mean!

185
00:15:43,748 --> 00:15:48,835
They gotta take out their cussedness
on somebody's old folks!

186
00:15:51,606 --> 00:15:54,610
I done had my share
and I ain't takin' no more no how!

187
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,476
I takin' no more!

188
00:15:57,579 --> 00:16:01,440
Ain't exactly a veranda, honey... but to me
it's the porch that makes the house a home!

189
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,503
Sam, I think I got the stove working!

190
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,132
We'll all light it together.

191
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:50,965
Our first fire in our own house.

192
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:53,439
Yeah... You sure made a good job
of that stove, Honey.

193
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,976
Won't be long before we'll have
a good hot cup of coffee.

194
00:16:55,977 --> 00:16:57,667
You get some water, Sam.

195
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,485
Jotty, Daisy... get the cups
and put 'em on the table.

196
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:10,286
You reckon Granny's gonna
stay out there all night?

197
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,404
I'd say she'll be too coward.

198
00:17:13,418 --> 00:17:14,943
Dis... you go call Granny.

199
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:25,532
Granny... you want some good hot coffee?

200
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:30,763
No sir! Nothin' what comes outta that
old pot don't tempt me none at all!

201
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:53,945
Mama, it's raining and
Granny won't come in!

202
00:17:53,946 --> 00:17:56,832
Well, we'll have our coffee anyway.

203
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,072
Sit down, Honey...
I'll get it.

204
00:18:07,235 --> 00:18:09,819
Oh, Papa... there's a hole in the ceiling!

205
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:54,088
Granny's changed her mind!

206
00:18:58,187 --> 00:18:59,673
Come on Granny.

207
00:19:02,504 --> 00:19:03,844
Here, I've got your good blanket...

208
00:19:03,845 --> 00:19:06,186
Now put it around you before you catch
your death of cold.

209
00:19:16,272 --> 00:19:18,027
Here's some honey, Granny.

210
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:19,601
Honey!...

211
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,905
They not only let me die
of the cold...

212
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:25,206
But they hide out the goodies on me!

213
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,857
How do you want your bedcover, honey?

214
00:20:12,055 --> 00:20:14,265
With the fire going,
it's nice and warm in here.

215
00:20:26,165 --> 00:20:27,706
Goodnight Granny.

216
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:18,869
Nona, come on over here.

217
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:35,057
Oh, that's a pretty one, Sam!

218
00:21:35,058 --> 00:21:36,873
Yeah, Honey... that's a mighty fine fish!

219
00:21:36,874 --> 00:21:38,178
It'll make us a good dinner.

220
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:40,340
Well I figured I'd take
this one to Denvers,

221
00:21:40,353 --> 00:21:42,622
our neighbour down the
road, with a good well.

222
00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:45,698
That little one in the bucket's
for us.

223
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:48,226
Aren't you gonna put on dry clothes?

224
00:21:48,227 --> 00:21:50,719
Oh, I'll dry it off walkin' over...
won't be gone long.

225
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,281
You'd better keep Zoomy here.

226
00:21:52,282 --> 00:21:53,991
This one ain't so big, honey.

227
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:58,910
Well I'll catch us another tomorrow...
a big one... we'll keep it

228
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:06,941
Go along with your mama, Jotty.

229
00:22:33,415 --> 00:22:35,275
Mighty fine place
you got around here.

230
00:22:35,276 --> 00:22:36,782
You the owner?
You Henry Devers?

231
00:22:36,783 --> 00:22:38,838
- No, folks call me Finlay.
- Howdy!

232
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:41,647
He's my uncle...
He's over yonder in the shed.

233
00:22:43,538 --> 00:22:44,871
Much obliged... Finlay.

234
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:58,757
Howdy!

235
00:23:00,865 --> 00:23:02,092
What do you want?

236
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:03,910
I'm your neighbour...
my name's Sam Tucker...

237
00:23:03,911 --> 00:23:05,360
I brought you a fish.

238
00:23:05,361 --> 00:23:06,385
Mean do I want to buy it?

239
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,419
No... It's a present.

240
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,281
Well, leave it if you got no use for it.

241
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:11,774
Where'll I put it?

242
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:14,209
Any place... on the bench.

243
00:23:17,156 --> 00:23:19,465
Say, that's a mighty queer-lookin'
fishhook you picked up.

244
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:22,403
I ain't no graveller...
I fish hook and line.

245
00:23:22,404 --> 00:23:23,644
Aim to use it in this river?

246
00:23:23,645 --> 00:23:26,295
Aim to use it any place I feel like it.
Finlay!

247
00:23:40,348 --> 00:23:43,030
Take this here fish, and give it
to Becky to cook for dinner.

248
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:45,418
Are you the new neighbour?...
I'm Becky Devers.

249
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:46,834
Yes'm... we're the Tuckers.

250
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:49,128
Be nice havin' folks next door...
It's lonesome here.

251
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:51,015
What are you doin' here...
I didn't send for you.

252
00:23:51,016 --> 00:23:52,062
Well, I thought, pop...

253
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,661
You don't have to think...
Get that fish and go back to the house.

254
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:57,226
And you get your washin' finished!

255
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:10,836
My wife be likely over soon
to borrow some of your well water.

256
00:24:10,837 --> 00:24:13,970
So that's what you come for!

257
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:16,216
That's right.
My well ain't no good.

258
00:24:16,217 --> 00:24:18,157
I coulda told you that.

259
00:24:19,453 --> 00:24:20,597
So can I, now.

260
00:24:21,685 --> 00:24:22,924
What about that water?

261
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:25,517
Why don't you get your water
at the river.

262
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,893
River water ain't no good
for kids to drink.

263
00:24:31,014 --> 00:24:33,125
Alright...
As long as there's plenty of water.

264
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:36,291
You'll have to make other arrangements,
though, when summer comes.

265
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:38,280
Gets pretty weak
when the weather's dry.

266
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,947
We'll take turns about replacin'
the wore-out rope.

267
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:46,224
Seems pretty wore-out already.

268
00:24:46,225 --> 00:24:50,440
Well, if you don't like it, next well's
5 miles down the road.

269
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:53,238
Suits me.

270
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:56,567
Alright... so long Devers.

271
00:24:57,032 --> 00:24:58,154
Just a minute!

272
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:01,660
You're likely gonna fix your own well,
ain't you?

273
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:04,790
If you're rentin' you must have
some savings put aside.

274
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:07,860
I got 2 good arms...
worth more than savings.

275
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:11,256
To hear folks talk...
you think you can be

276
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:13,617
farmers just like that...
with your bare hands.

277
00:25:13,618 --> 00:25:16,039
Got any tools or tractors?

278
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,776
No, I ain't got no tractor.

279
00:25:17,777 --> 00:25:21,239
But I got 2 mules and a good old plough...
and a friend o' mine's lendin' the seed.

280
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,113
And Ruston furnishes the fertilizer.

281
00:25:23,774 --> 00:25:26,083
Don't need much
for good muddy land like that.

282
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,975
And he gives the poison for the weevils,
pays the cotton-pickers...

283
00:25:29,976 --> 00:25:32,505
even lets you draw grub
from his commissary.

284
00:25:32,506 --> 00:25:34,589
After you get the ground broke.

285
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,062
Yeah... he just furnishes
about everything...

286
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:40,067
With the sweat.

287
00:25:40,068 --> 00:25:41,677
And if you get by the year...

288
00:25:41,678 --> 00:25:43,988
he generously lets you
take your share of the crop...

289
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:44,955
Ain't that right?

290
00:25:44,956 --> 00:25:47,456
Why ask me... It seems
you know it already.

291
00:25:47,457 --> 00:25:49,258
Oh, but I know Ruston...

292
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:52,277
Ain't the first time he's gettin'
a piece of land cleaned off for nothin'.

293
00:25:53,106 --> 00:25:54,921
Until you get your ploughin' started...

294
00:25:56,273 --> 00:25:57,939
how do you aim to eat?

295
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,665
I aim to fish...

296
00:25:59,666 --> 00:26:01,677
and hunt varmints
and sell a few skins.

297
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:04,095
Lots of folks like that
live around here.

298
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:05,623
Plenty more done it before.

299
00:26:07,178 --> 00:26:08,386
How about you?

300
00:26:08,854 --> 00:26:10,034
How'd you get started?

301
00:26:14,693 --> 00:26:15,811
Sharecrop.

302
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:20,042
First year I lost my whole crop,
it was ruined by the hail.

303
00:26:21,075 --> 00:26:25,127
Next year black leg got my cow and pig
that I'd spent all my savings for.

304
00:26:25,743 --> 00:26:27,764
My wife caught cold
and she died.

305
00:26:27,765 --> 00:26:32,679
Two years later, one of my kids, the boy...
He died from spring sickness.

306
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:35,989
Maybe I lost them both,
my woman and my kid...

307
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,251
because I didn't have
no money for doctoring.

308
00:26:39,195 --> 00:26:41,987
And here I am with a farm...
a good one...

309
00:26:41,988 --> 00:26:44,316
belongs all to me
and worth lots of money.

310
00:26:45,221 --> 00:26:47,628
Only, I can't forget what it cost me.

311
00:26:49,189 --> 00:26:52,615
So when I see young folk like you
with their proudness...

312
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,702
noses stuck in the air...
just makes me laugh!

313
00:26:58,572 --> 00:27:01,060
Well... much obliged for the water,

314
00:27:02,248 --> 00:27:03,727
And good luck with your fishhook.

315
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:16,291
Hey... Finlay...

316
00:27:16,788 --> 00:27:19,314
What's that big old fishhook
you uncle's fixing up there?

317
00:27:19,315 --> 00:27:20,663
Is there a whale in this river?

318
00:27:20,664 --> 00:27:21,729
That's for "Lead Pencil".

319
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,209
"Lead Pencil"... what's that?

320
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,746
A catfish... he's got 2 whiskers
like lead pencils.

321
00:27:25,747 --> 00:27:27,706
Biggest durned catfish
you ever seen in the river.

322
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:30,117
Hey! get that washing away Finlay!

323
00:28:44,729 --> 00:28:45,912
Nothin'?

324
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:49,544
Must be the wind.

325
00:28:49,545 --> 00:28:51,246
It's more the time.

326
00:28:51,247 --> 00:28:55,072
For days now the moon has been moving
closer and closer to the North Star...

327
00:28:55,672 --> 00:28:57,913
The animals don't like that...
they hide out.

328
00:28:58,858 --> 00:29:01,893
It's crazy to go against the signs,
but what can you do?

329
00:29:01,894 --> 00:29:03,482
We gotta get fresh food.

330
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:08,894
Daisy, honey... why don't
you and Sonny get into bed.

331
00:29:08,895 --> 00:29:10,670
Nice and warm there.

332
00:29:21,565 --> 00:29:23,007
Did you have a nice day at school?

333
00:29:29,355 --> 00:29:30,430
She didn't go, Sam.

334
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:31,881
Why not?

335
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:37,166
It's too cold... she ain't got no coat...
She'll catch her death of cold.

336
00:29:39,718 --> 00:29:42,169
But they just gotta go to school.

337
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:46,439
Just because we're having hard times right
now doesn't mean we gotta stop nothing.

338
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,958
We gotta keep going.

339
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:52,956
Once we give up we won't have the courage
to get back to the good time.

340
00:29:54,897 --> 00:29:57,812
As I see it... ain't gonna have
no dinner again tonight.

341
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:02,226
Never you mind, Granny.

342
00:30:02,227 --> 00:30:05,118
For breakfast we'll have a nice big bowl
of cornmeal mush.

343
00:30:07,512 --> 00:30:12,120
You'll all look down on my cold dead face
in that county pine box.

344
00:30:12,121 --> 00:30:13,190
You'll be sorry then.

345
00:30:13,486 --> 00:30:14,230
Maybe.

346
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:18,415
You keep on promisin', Granny!

347
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,804
You don't never deliver the goods!

348
00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:22,920
Hush your mouth!
You can't talk to me like that!

349
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:24,080
You ain't even a real Tucker!

350
00:30:24,547 --> 00:30:26,216
Well, you ain't either!

351
00:30:26,306 --> 00:30:27,149
Hey... Honey!

352
00:30:29,697 --> 00:30:31,273
Daisy's got to be coated.

353
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:36,075
They gotta go to school.

354
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,748
Don't you take my blanket, Sam!
Don't you touch my blanket!

355
00:30:39,875 --> 00:30:42,753
Sam Tucker... you take one bit
of my best blanket, you'll get punished...

356
00:30:42,871 --> 00:30:46,275
Granny, ain't you got no heart...?
You want Daisy to catch her death?

357
00:30:46,474 --> 00:30:48,230
There'll be enough blanket
to keep you warm.

358
00:30:48,232 --> 00:30:49,493
I like it big!

359
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:51,162
Curse you, Sam Tucker!

360
00:30:51,193 --> 00:30:53,071
My big blanket!
Curse you!

361
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,167
Granny!

362
00:30:56,653 --> 00:30:58,314
Sam Tucker's the boss here...

363
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,037
He can cut up whatever he likes.

364
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:01,253
He's the boss!

365
00:31:01,254 --> 00:31:02,458
You hear me?

366
00:31:06,902 --> 00:31:08,983
Oh, Granny!

367
00:31:09,176 --> 00:31:11,658
Now don't take on so!

368
00:31:14,788 --> 00:31:17,571
Look, I think I know where
there's a nice swarm of wild bees...

369
00:31:17,671 --> 00:31:20,363
Maybe tomorrow I'll go out
and get you some honey!

370
00:31:20,364 --> 00:31:21,935
Maybe.

371
00:31:21,936 --> 00:31:23,023
Why me?

372
00:31:24,413 --> 00:31:28,114
Why me? I don't care for folks comin',
and helpin' yourselves, you know.

373
00:31:28,115 --> 00:31:31,011
Now don't you worry!
I'll get your honey.

374
00:31:34,998 --> 00:31:36,032
Nony...

375
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:39,698
You know I guess you're
a right good Tucker after all.

376
00:31:41,688 --> 00:31:43,227
That Sam of yours...

377
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:46,978
He's 'most as good a man
as my Fayette!

378
00:32:05,768 --> 00:32:07,248
My best blanket!

379
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:21,063
Yessir, that carcase of yours
is sure gonna make 4 more Tuckers happy.

380
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:24,023
C'mon Zoom!

381
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:41,557
Yes sir, you're hide 'll
just about bring the

382
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,724
price of a pair of silk
stockings for mama.

383
00:33:44,676 --> 00:33:46,076
Nice and shiny!

384
00:34:03,783 --> 00:34:05,857
Reckon we can eat now, folks!

385
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,375
Easy!... You'll all get your share!

386
00:34:17,376 --> 00:34:20,323
Hold on, everybody...
there's gonna be a blessing.

387
00:34:22,566 --> 00:34:23,737
Much obliged, Lord...

388
00:34:23,738 --> 00:34:26,438
Looks like the Tuckers are gonna
make the grade after all.

389
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:28,761
Amen.

390
00:34:29,075 --> 00:34:29,775
Granny!

391
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:35,158
Granny gets the first,
because she's the eldest.

392
00:34:43,385 --> 00:34:46,289
I'd taken the Lord to be a stranger
in this house!

393
00:34:48,304 --> 00:34:50,258
Then comes Jotty,
coz he's the littlest.

394
00:34:54,697 --> 00:34:57,228
Then comes Papa
coz he caught this possum.

395
00:35:03,527 --> 00:35:06,775
And this one's for Zoomy...

396
00:35:06,776 --> 00:35:08,167
Because he helped him.

397
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:16,017
And last of all, Daisy and me...
coz we're the womenfolk.

398
00:35:16,018 --> 00:35:20,390
At school they say this kinda food's
bad for you all the time.

399
00:35:25,851 --> 00:35:28,021
They say you gotta eat vegetables.

400
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:29,989
Too much meat's bad.

401
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,459
Vegetables in winter?

402
00:35:31,902 --> 00:35:32,837
If you don't...

403
00:35:33,789 --> 00:35:36,284
they say you get pellagra.

404
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:38,608
That must be the 'spring sickness', Sam.

405
00:35:40,716 --> 00:35:42,941
Why, it's vegetables
that causes 'spring sickness'.

406
00:35:43,506 --> 00:35:45,932
That's when you get it... 'long about
the time you start eating vegetables.

407
00:35:46,198 --> 00:35:49,122
I oughta know... I lost
three o' mine from it.

408
00:35:49,543 --> 00:35:51,972
Their Uncle Walter...
Aunt Beck and Sue.

409
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:54,464
And not one was over 6!

410
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:57,468
Shucks... look at THEM.

411
00:35:58,102 --> 00:36:00,741
And anything a body likes as good as that,
couldn't be bad for 'em.

412
00:36:01,901 --> 00:36:03,640
Ain't that true, Nona?

413
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:04,943
That's right, Sam.

414
00:38:13,532 --> 00:38:15,697
We done all that ourself.

415
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:18,965
Just kept workin' and pluggin' away...

416
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,318
By gosh, we done good.

417
00:38:22,354 --> 00:38:25,816
Before long now we can start plantin'
our cotton roundabout the twentieth.

418
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,686
Then that crop will really get started.

419
00:38:53,448 --> 00:38:54,941
Hold that for me, will you.

420
00:39:03,055 --> 00:39:07,024
You see those little green woolly worms
fallin' outta that tree... ten a minute?

421
00:39:07,025 --> 00:39:09,872
They're all drifting down together
in the same place.

422
00:39:09,873 --> 00:39:13,114
And some folk might think
that they're what "Lead Pencil" is after.

423
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:14,605
But they'd be wrong.

424
00:39:14,606 --> 00:39:16,484
Coz he's after somethin' else!

425
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:18,637
He ain't interested in no worms.

426
00:39:18,638 --> 00:39:20,699
Old "Lead" is a pretty smart old guy.

427
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,041
Wouldn't hardly live to be
as old as he is, if he wasn't.

428
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:26,277
I'll bet you old "Lead"
waits for his dinner

429
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,036
right over yonder at
that there drift.

430
00:39:28,661 --> 00:39:30,662
It's like a trap, on the river bottom.

431
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,864
Is "Lead Pencil" older than Granny, Papa?

432
00:39:33,865 --> 00:39:35,421
Yeah... he's older than Granny.

433
00:39:36,102 --> 00:39:41,678
Yessir, it must be yonder, old
"Lead Pencil" has got his cubby.

434
00:39:46,495 --> 00:39:47,759
Gimme that, Honey.

435
00:41:00,023 --> 00:41:01,056
Sam!

436
00:41:01,057 --> 00:41:02,306
Nony!

437
00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:05,682
You got to come here quick!

438
00:41:05,683 --> 00:41:07,003
What are you sayin', Granny?

439
00:41:07,828 --> 00:41:08,772
Jot's ailin'...

440
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:11,579
I reckon he's got the Spring Sickness!

441
00:41:12,229 --> 00:41:12,998
Spring Sickness?!

442
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:14,655
How do you know?

443
00:41:15,427 --> 00:41:17,824
I am sayin' it's Spring Sickness!

444
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:21,264
Who'd know better 'n me?...
Already lost 3 from it.

445
00:41:44,538 --> 00:41:45,473
Sam...

446
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:48,631
I'm afraid!

447
00:42:00,767 --> 00:42:02,989
I didn't see no reason
to bother you, Doctor...

448
00:42:04,241 --> 00:42:05,671
It was just that little sore.

449
00:42:06,749 --> 00:42:08,530
Sonny ain't ever been sick.

450
00:42:09,103 --> 00:42:10,391
When it grew and grew...

451
00:42:10,392 --> 00:42:13,721
And now it seems like
it's just plum gonna possess him...

452
00:42:16,087 --> 00:42:19,814
You see Doctor... it's like some evil
crawlin' worm eatin' up my baby!

453
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:23,752
I can't stand to watch it
no longer, Doctor!

454
00:42:23,753 --> 00:42:26,355
You gotta do somethin' to stop it!

455
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,999
You don't have a cow, do you?

456
00:42:41,591 --> 00:42:42,496
No, Sir.

457
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,930
Well, you better tell Sam to get one.

458
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:49,584
How do we get a cow?

459
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,304
Borrow one!

460
00:42:51,305 --> 00:42:54,741
Let Sam raise a heifer for somebody.

461
00:42:55,431 --> 00:42:57,418
Or borrow some milk, anyway.

462
00:42:57,419 --> 00:43:00,079
A pint a day...
or better still, a quart.

463
00:43:01,586 --> 00:43:04,245
Any neighbour with a cow
could spare you that.

464
00:43:04,246 --> 00:43:06,877
I'll try Doctor...
What medicine?

465
00:43:06,878 --> 00:43:07,980
Undress the boy.

466
00:43:13,155 --> 00:43:15,122
What vegetables
you been eatin' lately?

467
00:43:16,202 --> 00:43:19,419
Vegetables?...
Couldn't grow vegetables in winter.

468
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,772
You got any money?

469
00:43:20,773 --> 00:43:22,720
Yes, Doctor... I got your $2.

470
00:43:23,256 --> 00:43:25,289
Sam's got $1.35 more...

471
00:43:25,998 --> 00:43:26,960
Keep it.

472
00:43:26,961 --> 00:43:29,852
Take all your money
and spend it all for vegetables.

473
00:43:29,853 --> 00:43:30,912
And get some lemons...

474
00:43:30,913 --> 00:43:33,285
Give him a glass of lemonade,
twice a day.

475
00:43:33,286 --> 00:43:35,222
And get that milk...!
Do you hear?

476
00:43:35,223 --> 00:43:37,759
If you don't give him milk
and vegetables...

477
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,384
anything that I can do will be
just plum wasted.

478
00:43:40,939 --> 00:43:42,562
And with the milk and vegetables?

479
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,813
I think he's got a chance.

480
00:44:01,744 --> 00:44:03,818
Thank you! Call again!

481
00:44:05,116 --> 00:44:07,933
Me... I know what war is.

482
00:44:08,611 --> 00:44:11,653
We was right close to Chateau Thierry
and the old colonel...

483
00:44:12,302 --> 00:44:15,476
He brung us all together, and said...

484
00:44:15,477 --> 00:44:19,642
Young man, in civilian life,
never brag about you conquests...

485
00:44:19,643 --> 00:44:22,238
- Whether they be love or war.
- Shut up, young fella!

486
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:24,433
I'm tellin' ya... I know!

487
00:44:24,434 --> 00:44:25,806
And I know I know!

488
00:44:28,873 --> 00:44:29,997
Well, if it ain't Sam Tucker!

489
00:44:29,998 --> 00:44:31,503
Tim... when did you get in town?

490
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:34,527
- How much for these here pipe cleaners?
- 10 cents, for you.

491
00:44:34,528 --> 00:44:37,609
Has it gone up?
Used to be a nickel?

492
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:41,067
No ma'am... Old Zeke 'll be
mighty pleased with 'em, ma'am

493
00:44:41,778 --> 00:44:43,989
Tim just came back to show off
his city clothes.

494
00:44:44,735 --> 00:44:45,870
Take a look at that fancy tie!

495
00:44:45,871 --> 00:44:48,999
Seems like in the city, dollars grow faster
than beans in the field!

496
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,361
Don't bet on it!

497
00:44:50,717 --> 00:44:52,313
Hey, I been lookin' all over for you...

498
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,990
Let's go over to Seamen's and I'll buy
you some beer and tell you all about it.

499
00:44:55,014 --> 00:44:57,053
Brother, I'm with you any time
you'll buy me a beer.

500
00:44:57,106 --> 00:44:58,970
Well Harmie... Nona and Jotty
are over at Doc Whites...

501
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,024
When they come over tell them
I'll be back in a minute, will you?

502
00:45:01,294 --> 00:45:05,735
Yeah... I know what a minute means, when
you're drinkin' beer with old Timmy there.

503
00:45:06,187 --> 00:45:07,952
How much for this pair of garters?

504
00:45:07,953 --> 00:45:10,248
You said Nona and Jotty's
over at Doc White's?

505
00:45:10,911 --> 00:45:11,826
Yeah.

506
00:45:11,827 --> 00:45:13,120
What's wrong, Sam?

507
00:45:13,121 --> 00:45:14,236
Jotty's ailin'.

508
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,070
Ran into this Spring Sickness.

509
00:45:17,287 --> 00:45:21,077
Poor Nona... with a sick kid
she don't hardly get a wink of sleep.

510
00:45:21,078 --> 00:45:22,242
That's tough, man.

511
00:45:22,243 --> 00:45:24,640
My ma came out to my place
yesterday, to help.

512
00:45:25,356 --> 00:45:26,814
Harmie brought her out in his truck.

513
00:45:27,952 --> 00:45:29,165
That's kind of a relief.

514
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:39,939
Slow down!

515
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,738
Would you be interested in coming
and work in the factory with me?

516
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:52,888
Are you crazy?
What would I do in a factory?

517
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:53,907
I'm a farmer.

518
00:45:53,908 --> 00:45:56,757
Well, they just opened a new plant
and they're just cryin' for men.

519
00:45:56,758 --> 00:45:58,480
Don't even have to be skilled.

520
00:45:58,481 --> 00:46:01,417
I know the foreman...
I can get you in a minute.

521
00:46:01,693 --> 00:46:02,744
Pay much?

522
00:46:02,745 --> 00:46:04,658
Seven bucks a day!

523
00:46:06,516 --> 00:46:07,524
Seven bucks a day!?

524
00:46:12,713 --> 00:46:14,449
Howdy gents... what'll it be?

525
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:15,531
Ain't you new here?

526
00:46:15,532 --> 00:46:16,287
What'll it be?

527
00:46:16,288 --> 00:46:18,522
OK, big-shot...
2 bottles of beer.

528
00:46:18,523 --> 00:46:20,974
Sure is hot in here...
what about a beer for me?

529
00:46:20,975 --> 00:46:22,300
I'm mighty thirsty.

530
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:25,099
Why don't you ask your papa here...
He gets it wholesale.

531
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,701
Oh, him! This ain't one of his good days.

532
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,957
Must've got out of bed
on the wrong side!

533
00:46:31,346 --> 00:46:32,774
Well I got out on the right side...

534
00:46:32,775 --> 00:46:34,224
Bartender... another beer.

535
00:46:34,909 --> 00:46:37,851
Handsome... ain't I seen you
some place before?

536
00:46:38,968 --> 00:46:40,311
Nuh... what'd you say?

537
00:46:40,312 --> 00:46:42,593
I asked you... ain't I ever seen you
some place before?

538
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:44,188
Could be... I don't know.

539
00:46:45,129 --> 00:46:46,473
You in town all alone?

540
00:46:46,474 --> 00:46:47,487
Oh, no ma'am...

541
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:49,071
Like you see, I'm with my friend here...

542
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:51,200
And my wife's waitin' for me
at Harmie's store.

543
00:46:51,201 --> 00:46:53,508
- So you got a wife?
- Yep... I got a wife.

544
00:46:54,466 --> 00:46:57,408
There's some that got wives
and they're still nice and... friendly.

545
00:46:57,409 --> 00:46:59,823
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I was studyin' about somethin'.

546
00:46:59,824 --> 00:47:02,351
Let's go down the end of the bar, pal...
we can't talk here.

547
00:47:02,926 --> 00:47:03,905
Excuse me, ma'am.

548
00:47:06,233 --> 00:47:08,830
I ain't got no wife waitin' for me, baby...
How about a date tonight?

549
00:47:08,831 --> 00:47:10,283
You big pig!

550
00:47:10,284 --> 00:47:12,253
You know what you can do
with your date.

551
00:47:12,254 --> 00:47:15,188
OK... OK, baby...
We'll talk about it later.

552
00:47:22,313 --> 00:47:23,648
To your kid, Sam!

553
00:47:26,595 --> 00:47:27,971
Seven bucks a day, eh?

554
00:47:28,694 --> 00:47:29,978
So it's "yes"... you'll come?

555
00:47:29,979 --> 00:47:31,713
Don't rightly see how I can, Tim...

556
00:47:31,714 --> 00:47:33,072
I made a deal with Ruston...

557
00:47:33,073 --> 00:47:35,386
I already got some credit
from his commissary.

558
00:47:35,387 --> 00:47:38,000
At $7 a day it wouldn't take you long
to pay him back.

559
00:47:38,001 --> 00:47:39,335
Yeah, but I'm tellin' you Tim...

560
00:47:39,336 --> 00:47:41,742
This is the first time I been able
to farm my own crop...

561
00:47:41,743 --> 00:47:43,404
Just like I always wanted to.

562
00:47:43,405 --> 00:47:45,721
Ain't somethin' I can give up,
just like that.

563
00:47:45,722 --> 00:47:47,416
Well, how much can you get
on your credit.

564
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,973
Man, with that there ground I got...

565
00:47:49,974 --> 00:47:51,928
it'll be the finest crop
in the country.

566
00:47:51,929 --> 00:47:54,080
What does that mean...
"The finest crop in the country"...?

567
00:47:54,081 --> 00:47:56,568
With any luck at all I can make
2 bales an acre.

568
00:47:56,569 --> 00:47:58,299
How much does that make for you?

569
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,284
More 'n 50 bales.

570
00:47:59,285 --> 00:48:00,737
No, I mean how much money?

571
00:48:00,738 --> 00:48:03,612
Do you know that on that ground
that I been workin' on now...

572
00:48:03,613 --> 00:48:07,864
Old man Corinth made a fortune
in the last cotton boom... a real fortune.

573
00:48:07,865 --> 00:48:09,631
So that's the idea!

574
00:48:09,632 --> 00:48:11,943
All you farmers is just the same...

575
00:48:11,944 --> 00:48:13,160
Gamblers!

576
00:48:13,161 --> 00:48:15,011
That's what you all are...
to a man.

577
00:48:15,012 --> 00:48:17,819
Year after year
you starve yourself to death...

578
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,435
and hope that some fine day...

579
00:48:21,214 --> 00:48:22,740
Well... I think you're loco!

580
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:25,085
Me, I'd rather be safe, first.

581
00:48:25,086 --> 00:48:27,462
Me... I'd rather work in my field.

582
00:48:27,463 --> 00:48:30,992
I feel better that way...
I feel more free.

583
00:48:30,993 --> 00:48:32,613
Free?... Free?

584
00:48:32,614 --> 00:48:35,552
Man, with money in your pocket,
you're as free as the wind.

585
00:48:36,963 --> 00:48:39,146
With this... you want a good meal...
you go to a restaurant.

586
00:48:39,147 --> 00:48:40,798
Good room... you go to a hotel.

587
00:48:40,799 --> 00:48:42,700
All you gotta do
is flash your greenback...

588
00:48:42,701 --> 00:48:43,978
You get anything you want.

589
00:48:45,597 --> 00:48:48,531
You call that free,
sweatin' from mornin' 'til night?

590
00:48:48,532 --> 00:48:50,715
In the bakin' hot sun,
workin' in them fields!

591
00:48:51,603 --> 00:48:53,801
Oh, I'll allow as how
it's sometimes pretty hard.

592
00:48:54,219 --> 00:48:57,357
What I mean is, being able
to decide things for myself...

593
00:48:57,899 --> 00:49:00,452
To know I can choose my
own time about plantin'

594
00:49:00,465 --> 00:49:02,546
and ploughin' and
harvestin' the crop.

595
00:49:02,547 --> 00:49:06,393
That I can do it all in my own way...
and don't have to answer to nobody.

596
00:49:06,822 --> 00:49:09,458
I mean for me alone
being accountable for it.

597
00:49:09,459 --> 00:49:13,733
Whether the weevils strip you clean...
or you get the best price.

598
00:49:14,663 --> 00:49:16,624
Instead of all that baloney...
that means no?

599
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,759
Afraid so, Tim.

600
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,567
Well, pal... I think you're
makin' a big mistake.

601
00:49:23,348 --> 00:49:25,381
Hey, bartender... where's my other $4?

602
00:49:25,912 --> 00:49:26,641
What $4?

603
00:49:26,642 --> 00:49:28,229
I gave you a $5 bill.

604
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:31,328
Oh, no... Lizzy... you seen that was a $1.

605
00:49:31,329 --> 00:49:32,615
Of course I did.

606
00:49:36,149 --> 00:49:38,630
And the pretty boy
who's goin' home to his wife...

607
00:49:38,631 --> 00:49:39,959
He seen it, too.

608
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:43,572
Well I'll be doggoned!
So that's how it is!

609
00:49:44,195 --> 00:49:46,025
Nothing but a hicky old farmer...

610
00:49:46,026 --> 00:49:48,853
and yet the girls fall for you
like a ton of bricks!

611
00:49:49,397 --> 00:49:52,884
What the heck have you got
that I can't buy with my dough?

612
00:49:56,468 --> 00:50:00,092
Give me my $4, you big double-jointed son
of a skunk, or I'll tear this joint apart!

613
00:50:00,145 --> 00:50:01,366
Outside!

614
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:04,823
OK brother... but I hope it's gonna
be worth the $4 to you.

615
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:11,890
What do you aim to do?

616
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:14,070
I ain't asking you to help, Sam...
you got a family.

617
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,178
I wouldn't start any more trouble, Tim.

618
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,195
Don't stay here, Sam.

619
00:50:17,196 --> 00:50:19,329
This'd have to cost you
more than $4.

620
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:21,546
I'm asking you as a
friend not to stay here.

621
00:52:12,695 --> 00:52:15,074
Milk and greens...

622
00:52:19,972 --> 00:52:22,496
That doctor man done said about Jotty.

623
00:52:24,289 --> 00:52:26,798
I'd like to see some of them
damn vegetables to grow.

624
00:52:28,709 --> 00:52:31,135
Where he figure we're gonna
get that there milk from.

625
00:52:32,722 --> 00:52:34,583
Out of the sky... just like that!

626
00:52:46,536 --> 00:52:50,013
Seems like Sam ain't the only
pig-headed one around here.

627
00:52:50,894 --> 00:52:52,916
That ma of his!...

628
00:52:52,917 --> 00:52:56,815
Thinks she can cure the Spring Sickness
with fresh air!

629
00:52:59,038 --> 00:53:01,337
A widow-lady her age
ought to have better sense.

630
00:53:01,852 --> 00:53:07,050
Me? I say that baby 'll just catch
its death in this here wind!

631
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:14,011
I'm gonna get that milk.

632
00:53:17,275 --> 00:53:18,939
Poor Sam!

633
00:53:20,392 --> 00:53:23,196
Men in this here Tucker family
just ain't strong.

634
00:53:26,154 --> 00:53:28,073
No sir... it's just like
I told you Tucker...

635
00:53:28,074 --> 00:53:29,421
I don't need no extra help.

636
00:53:30,522 --> 00:53:32,514
I got Finlay and my girl Becky.

637
00:53:33,686 --> 00:53:36,683
Too bad about your boy...
I know how what that is...

638
00:53:36,684 --> 00:53:38,201
Sick kid is pretty sorrowful.

639
00:53:38,991 --> 00:53:40,389
Pitch it in Becky!

640
00:53:45,962 --> 00:53:49,575
Like I told you before, it's wrong for
a man to get too big for his breeches.

641
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:52,463
When you got no money,
you work for them what's got it...

642
00:53:52,464 --> 00:53:53,567
That there's the rule.

643
00:53:55,407 --> 00:53:58,268
Why don't you go back to Ruston...
get your 6 bits a day...

644
00:53:59,052 --> 00:54:00,550
Some milk for your chap...

645
00:54:00,551 --> 00:54:02,044
and maybe some doctor, even.

646
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:05,929
About the milk, like you see,
I can't rightly spare a drop.

647
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,435
Me? I got no milk for m'self...
It's all for the pigs.

648
00:54:09,436 --> 00:54:10,714
Pour the rest in, Becky.

649
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:12,747
Finlay... bring the drain.

650
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:20,845
Your cotton? Coming along?
Not too many bugs?

651
00:54:20,846 --> 00:54:22,617
I seen you the other day in field...

652
00:54:22,618 --> 00:54:25,139
You were shavin' the cotton
so close to the ground with the plough...

653
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,166
You scared me!

654
00:54:26,167 --> 00:54:28,728
Still that's the best way
to get rid of the bugs...

655
00:54:28,729 --> 00:54:31,079
Rolls 'em right out in the sun...
The heat kills 'em...

656
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,366
Better than any poison!

657
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:35,183
But you gotta have a good eye
and a steady hand.

658
00:54:35,184 --> 00:54:38,010
You're a good worker alright, Tucker.

659
00:54:38,011 --> 00:54:40,510
If I was you,
I wouldn't think twice...

660
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:42,546
I'd go back to work for Ruston.

661
00:54:42,547 --> 00:54:45,848
If I wanted to give up,
I wouldn't have to go back to Ruston.

662
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:47,964
Got somethin' better?

663
00:54:47,965 --> 00:54:49,450
Yeah... lots better.

664
00:54:50,392 --> 00:54:52,015
But like I already done told you...

665
00:54:52,016 --> 00:54:54,714
I want to grow my own crop...
and I aim to do it.

666
00:54:54,715 --> 00:54:56,510
Well, if you're so sure of yourself...

667
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:59,245
why are you always coming around
asking your neighbours for help?

668
00:54:59,518 --> 00:55:01,089
I never asked you for anything.

669
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:06,111
Likely, some old-fashioned idea
I had about neighbourliness...

670
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,084
Take good care of them pigs.

671
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:12,893
That's sure what I'm gonna do.

672
00:55:12,928 --> 00:55:16,061
See that that black hog eats
all his dinner, do you hear?

673
00:55:17,796 --> 00:55:19,461
So long, Devers.

674
00:55:29,852 --> 00:55:31,294
Sam! Sam!

675
00:55:38,471 --> 00:55:40,711
Here... take this...
It's for Jotty.

676
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:41,737
Thanks, Becky.

677
00:55:41,913 --> 00:55:43,809
I can get you some more
if you want some more.

678
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:45,177
My daddy won't have to see.

679
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:46,381
I'm much obliged, Becky...

680
00:55:46,467 --> 00:55:48,767
and I'll take it, coz my
boy's really bad off.

681
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:49,869
But I'll pay you for it.

682
00:55:50,161 --> 00:55:52,638
Becky... I seen ya...
I seen what ya done!

683
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:54,880
I feel just like breakin'
somebody's neck today.

684
00:55:54,881 --> 00:55:56,554
I'm gonna tell your pa
you was stealin' his milk!

685
00:55:56,555 --> 00:55:59,633
I knowed you was hackin' after this
fella... I saw you lookin' at him, before.

686
00:55:59,796 --> 00:56:00,715
I'm gonna tell your pa!

687
00:56:01,475 --> 00:56:03,059
What did you do that for?!

688
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,352
I'm never going to speak to you again.

689
00:56:05,353 --> 00:56:07,078
If I see you talkin' to HIM again...
you'll be sorry!

690
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:08,136
Yes, Finlay?

691
00:56:10,403 --> 00:56:14,165
Don't fret, Becky...
You're a good gal.

692
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:15,242
Thanks just the same.

693
00:56:48,808 --> 00:56:49,668
Honey...

694
00:57:02,514 --> 00:57:03,548
Nona...

695
00:57:07,843 --> 00:57:10,844
Nona...

696
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:13,306
I can't listen to him cry no more!

697
00:57:52,147 --> 00:57:56,014
Oh Lord, how come you put the sky up there
and this old mud down here.

698
00:57:56,015 --> 00:57:59,607
Made it so purdy if You didn't want us
to work it... to love it...

699
00:58:00,991 --> 00:58:02,790
Do You want me to give all this up?

700
00:58:02,791 --> 00:58:06,223
Move in town with Tim
and work with him in a factory...

701
00:58:06,224 --> 00:58:09,254
Under a roof as high as your sky...
and puts out your light?

702
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:12,276
Tell me Lord... help me to know.

703
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:41,657
How are you lady?
Did you have a good trip?

704
00:58:41,658 --> 00:58:43,524
She had a fine trip...
She's a wonderful old girl.

705
00:58:43,525 --> 00:58:44,505
Did you have a good trip, Timmy?

706
00:58:44,506 --> 00:58:47,354
You know Harmie, a cow's the only thing
I left in the country...

707
00:58:47,355 --> 00:58:48,490
that I miss in the city.

708
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:53,692
Believe me that sweet old gal is a lot
gentler than that Lizzy at the saloon.

709
00:58:53,693 --> 00:58:55,610
Harmie, can milk the cow now?

710
00:58:55,611 --> 00:58:56,795
Of course you can.

711
00:59:03,001 --> 00:59:04,316
That Harmie!

712
00:59:05,368 --> 00:59:09,115
He'll come waggin' in here one of
these days with a boa constrictor.

713
00:59:09,116 --> 00:59:11,549
I wouldn't be one mite surprised.

714
00:59:33,341 --> 00:59:37,413
I'm gonna call her...
"Uncle Walter".

715
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:57,753
Our vegetable garden!

716
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,433
That's Finlay... and them's Devers cattle!

717
01:01:48,394 --> 01:01:50,626
Oh, Jotty!

718
01:01:59,775 --> 01:02:01,174
You go on back in the house, Honey.

719
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,495
Go on back in the house.

720
01:02:16,578 --> 01:02:18,090
Finlay! What do you know about this?

721
01:02:18,091 --> 01:02:19,048
I don't know nothin'!

722
01:02:19,898 --> 01:02:20,664
I didn't do it!

723
01:02:20,665 --> 01:02:22,724
No... not by yourself...
but we both know who did!

724
01:02:22,725 --> 01:02:24,305
C'mon... we're goin' to your place.

725
01:02:38,903 --> 01:02:40,226
Devers... look at me...
Why did you do it?

726
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:42,586
What you mean why did I do it?
You can't prove nothin'...

727
01:02:42,587 --> 01:02:44,241
The Law 'd call it an Act of God!

728
01:02:44,242 --> 01:02:46,893
As for your garden...
you can plant it again, can't you?

729
01:02:46,894 --> 01:02:47,882
Plant it again!?

730
01:02:47,883 --> 01:02:49,737
Or did you come to borrow some seed?!

731
01:02:49,738 --> 01:02:50,509
I wouldn't borrow...

732
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:51,447
Wait a minute!

733
01:02:54,148 --> 01:02:55,233
This rope's plumb ruined...

734
01:02:55,234 --> 01:02:58,090
Remember what we agreed on
when you first come and asked for water?

735
01:02:58,411 --> 01:03:00,809
Yeah... about replacin' it...
It's time for you to do it now...

736
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,574
I don't aim to use this one no more.

737
01:03:02,575 --> 01:03:05,853
And I'm sick and tired of you
comin' around askin' for water.

738
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:09,045
And now Devers,
I'm gonna break your neck!

739
01:03:13,843 --> 01:03:16,428
I'm mighty glad you started this, Tucker.

740
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:19,404
Specially with Finlay here
as a witness.

741
01:03:21,318 --> 01:03:23,408
That makes two of us
can talk to the law.

742
01:04:12,985 --> 01:04:14,226
Pa... don't!

743
01:04:16,945 --> 01:04:18,544
Shut your mouth...
Get back in the house!

744
01:04:49,733 --> 01:04:51,310
You'd like to see me leave here,
wouldn't you?

745
01:04:51,311 --> 01:04:52,076
Yeah!

746
01:04:52,077 --> 01:04:53,562
- Why?
- Course I would!

747
01:04:53,563 --> 01:04:54,650
What did I ever do to you?

748
01:04:54,651 --> 01:04:56,929
Like I told you first time
you come to ask for water...

749
01:04:57,577 --> 01:05:00,239
Just don't like to see folks
tryin' to be better than they are.

750
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:03,490
This world has got to be them that
gives orders and them that takes 'em.

751
01:05:03,491 --> 01:05:06,308
And you figure it's you to give 'em
and me to take 'em... That right?

752
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:07,105
Why?

753
01:05:07,106 --> 01:05:08,837
Coz I worked hard... all my life.

754
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:10,533
I worked hard too...
You know that!

755
01:05:10,534 --> 01:05:12,447
Why here, and not someplace else?

756
01:05:12,448 --> 01:05:15,130
Before you come,
I was alone in this place...

757
01:05:15,131 --> 01:05:16,424
Everything was mine!

758
01:05:16,425 --> 01:05:19,226
I was figuring on buying your farm...
It was cheaper then.

759
01:05:19,227 --> 01:05:23,019
Now, if things goes on like this,
everything's going to be yours.

760
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,723
All I ever see is you...
everywhere I go!

761
01:05:25,724 --> 01:05:29,345
In the woods... killin' the varmints...
at the river, catching the fish.

762
01:05:29,346 --> 01:05:33,363
Even Finlay told me...
you set a line for "Lead Pencil".

763
01:05:33,364 --> 01:05:35,960
And my girl Becky...
You heard what she said!

764
01:05:36,209 --> 01:05:37,322
Sam!... Sam!

765
01:05:51,961 --> 01:05:53,032
Sam...

766
01:05:53,033 --> 01:05:56,514
Sam... you better take care
of that cut.

767
01:05:57,333 --> 01:06:01,350
Go on back in the house, Becky...
you best not bother about me anymore.

768
01:06:13,353 --> 01:06:14,318
Finlay!

769
01:06:16,378 --> 01:06:17,556
Get my gun!

770
01:06:34,765 --> 01:06:36,412
Uncle Henry!

771
01:06:38,304 --> 01:06:40,017
Shut your mouth!

772
01:07:22,077 --> 01:07:23,066
Holy smokes!

773
01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:25,100
It's "Lead Pencil"!

774
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:54,632
Can I help you?

775
01:07:54,633 --> 01:07:56,259
You can grab hold of that line.

776
01:08:06,011 --> 01:08:10,073
Finlay, you was right...
His whiskers is as big as lead pencils.

777
01:08:11,878 --> 01:08:13,011
Tucker...

778
01:08:14,449 --> 01:08:15,326
That's my fish.

779
01:08:16,494 --> 01:08:17,938
So you own the river, too, eh?

780
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:21,212
Well, maybe the law will call
my hook and line an Act of God.

781
01:08:21,213 --> 01:08:24,103
You give me the fish and swear
never to say you caught it...

782
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,519
I'll give you a dollar.

783
01:08:27,117 --> 01:08:29,515
I don't want your dollar...
My folks likes fish.

784
01:08:30,269 --> 01:08:32,866
Well, alright... let me take it
and keep it for a day or two...

785
01:08:32,867 --> 01:08:34,243
..and show it at the store... and...

786
01:08:34,244 --> 01:08:36,034
Then you can have it back.

787
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:39,101
Folks likes fresh fish, Devers.

788
01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:42,785
Well, let me take it, and...

789
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,618
You can use out of my garden.

790
01:08:49,596 --> 01:08:51,297
Well, you can have
the whole garden.

791
01:08:53,111 --> 01:08:55,565
The well rope...
How we gonna draw water?

792
01:08:56,814 --> 01:08:58,714
Oh... I got another rope
in the barn.

793
01:08:58,715 --> 01:09:01,181
What happened, Sam?
Becky told me...

794
01:09:01,182 --> 01:09:02,167
It ain't nothin'...

795
01:09:02,168 --> 01:09:05,466
I was just helpin' Devers pull
this big old catfish out of the river.

796
01:09:05,467 --> 01:09:07,443
He done caught "Lead Pencil".

797
01:09:30,947 --> 01:09:32,252
We forgot to tell you.

798
01:09:32,253 --> 01:09:34,300
Yeah... we plum forgot!

799
01:09:35,955 --> 01:09:36,920
You tell 'em, Harmie.

800
01:09:36,921 --> 01:09:40,424
Well... we're gonna get married, Sunday...

801
01:09:41,841 --> 01:09:44,209
I was just thinkin'
how blessed the Tuckers is...

802
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:46,066
and I can't help wonderin' why.

803
01:09:47,114 --> 01:09:48,698
I get the man I want...

804
01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:55,374
Here we are... all together...

805
01:09:56,199 --> 01:09:58,317
Jotty's cured and happy
once more...

806
01:09:59,057 --> 01:10:03,189
Daisy's so good at her book learnin',
she's gonna get a prize at school...

807
01:10:06,471 --> 01:10:08,686
Sam's growed the best crop
in the county.

808
01:10:08,687 --> 01:10:12,637
Maybe even gonna buy his own place,
that's what he makes off on it.

809
01:10:15,338 --> 01:10:19,787
I keep studyin' why Almighty
blessed us Tuckers so generous.

810
01:10:20,491 --> 01:10:21,626
But I reckon I know.

811
01:10:23,063 --> 01:10:25,921
Coz of Sam, and the way
he worked that farm o' his...

812
01:10:25,996 --> 01:10:27,819
that crop he done growed

813
01:10:28,073 --> 01:10:30,222
He must be just where the Lord
wanted him to be.

814
01:10:30,223 --> 01:10:31,272
You're sure right!

815
01:10:31,273 --> 01:10:33,938
Only if Sam is like he is, it's because
he's got such a good ma!

816
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:37,620
I can't think of nobody I'd rather have
than Harmie for my pa!

817
01:10:38,802 --> 01:10:41,569
He, son! You ain't a baby no more...
Leave your ma alone!

818
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:42,457
She's mine now!

819
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:43,950
Oh, she's yours is she?

820
01:10:43,951 --> 01:10:46,102
What do you think you are...
an Indian chief?

821
01:10:48,511 --> 01:10:49,998
Let me kiss the groom!

822
01:10:49,999 --> 01:10:53,238
These kids don't know anything...
they ain't had our experience.

823
01:10:53,918 --> 01:10:55,769
Hey, Harmie...
now that you're married...

824
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:57,556
I suppose you'll be
going on the wagon, eh?

825
01:10:57,557 --> 01:11:01,357
I was just thinkin'...
I'd start that tomorrow.

826
01:11:02,222 --> 01:11:03,538
But it ain't tomorrow yet!

827
01:11:06,393 --> 01:11:07,540
Say Sam... c'mon!

828
01:11:07,541 --> 01:11:08,658
Come on everybody!

829
01:11:14,085 --> 01:11:15,577
When we get rich...

830
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:21,465
When our ship comes in...

831
01:11:22,348 --> 01:11:26,092
I want us to get one of them
talking machines!

832
01:11:26,093 --> 01:11:27,934
And a lot o' sacred records.

833
01:11:29,912 --> 01:11:35,134
I want sit on the gallery...
and drink lemonade with ice in it!

834
01:11:36,323 --> 01:11:39,178
And hear "Beulah Land", you know?

835
01:11:39,179 --> 01:11:41,630
<i>Sweet Beulah Land...</i>

836
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:44,589
<i>Sweet Beulah Land...</i>

837
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:48,844
<i>As on thy highest mount I stand,</i>

838
01:11:48,845 --> 01:11:51,872
<i>I look away across the sea,</i>

839
01:11:52,518 --> 01:11:53,298
Say Harmie...

840
01:11:53,299 --> 01:11:55,818
You sure you didn't catch cold, that night?

841
01:11:55,819 --> 01:11:58,058
Don't you know this is
just the stuff to keep you warm?!

842
01:11:58,788 --> 01:12:00,721
Hey Harmie...
weren't you afeard of the law?

843
01:12:00,822 --> 01:12:01,607
Are you kiddin'?...

844
01:12:01,608 --> 01:12:03,733
The law is right there, waitin'
for the finished product.

845
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:08,077
Hey Sam... come on...
I want to show you somethin'.

846
01:12:08,078 --> 01:12:11,998
<i>Rye whisky, rye whisky,
rye whisky I cry...</i>

847
01:12:14,256 --> 01:12:15,847
Don't worry, I've got us a third!

848
01:12:21,251 --> 01:12:22,263
It's real city-stuff, Sam...

849
01:12:22,264 --> 01:12:24,243
Same as they drink
in them hot-shot nightclubs.

850
01:12:24,244 --> 01:12:25,657
Lay your nose on that!

851
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:27,737
Smell it, Sam... smell it!

852
01:12:28,919 --> 01:12:29,990
Ain't that somethin'!

853
01:12:30,461 --> 01:12:31,244
Sure is!

854
01:12:31,245 --> 01:12:32,329
3 bucks a quart!

855
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:35,302
We're gonna dance now, folks!

856
01:12:36,315 --> 01:12:38,667
Oh, I gotta find a good
hidin' place for this!

857
01:12:43,638 --> 01:12:44,920
Oh, there you are, Sam!...

858
01:12:44,921 --> 01:12:46,596
Come on honey...
you dance with me.

859
01:12:46,597 --> 01:12:48,605
No, you're very nice, ma'am...
but thanks just the same.

860
01:12:48,775 --> 01:12:51,107
After the dance we could
go outside, honey...

861
01:12:51,108 --> 01:12:53,160
I got some mighty fine drinkin' whisky
in my car.

862
01:12:53,161 --> 01:12:54,795
Thank you ma'am,
but I got a partner.

863
01:12:56,339 --> 01:12:57,949
How about dancin' with me, honey-child?

864
01:12:57,950 --> 01:12:59,727
And after the dancin'
go out to your car?

865
01:12:59,728 --> 01:13:01,378
Well, I don't know about that!

866
01:13:01,379 --> 01:13:03,279
C'mon now... don't be like that.

867
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:09,058
<i>Promenade single file...</i>

868
01:13:09,059 --> 01:13:10,797
<i>Ladies in the lead, that Indian style...</i>

869
01:13:10,798 --> 01:13:12,715
<i>Swing that girl behind you...</i>

870
01:13:14,287 --> 01:13:15,780
<i>Promenade single file...</i>

871
01:13:15,781 --> 01:13:17,382
<i>Ladies in the lead, that Indian style...</i>

872
01:13:17,383 --> 01:13:19,729
<i>Swing that girl behind you...</i>

873
01:13:20,656 --> 01:13:22,959
<i>Swing that girl behind you...</i>

874
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:25,682
<i>First and third lead to the right...</i>

875
01:13:25,683 --> 01:13:27,406
<i>Chase the rabbit, chase the squirrel...</i>

876
01:13:27,407 --> 01:13:28,956
<i>Chase that pretty girl 'round the world...</i>

877
01:13:28,957 --> 01:13:30,636
<i>Chase the possum, chase the coon...</i>

878
01:13:30,637 --> 01:13:32,652
<i>Chase that pretty boy round the moon...</i>

879
01:13:34,086 --> 01:13:35,577
<i>Four hand up and around you go...</i>

880
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:37,202
<i>Round and round and don't be slow...</i>

881
01:13:37,203 --> 01:13:38,838
<i>Away he's making a docey-doe...</i>

882
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,462
C'mon... get in there, folks.

883
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:25,186
Granny... mind what you're doin'...

884
01:14:25,187 --> 01:14:26,709
I got my bottle in there.

885
01:14:50,612 --> 01:14:51,964
Serves you right!

886
01:14:52,535 --> 01:14:54,354
Well, it cost me 3 bucks.

887
01:14:56,988 --> 01:14:59,047
Oh, so you think it's a joke, eh?

888
01:15:12,949 --> 01:15:13,949
The winner!

889
01:15:23,386 --> 01:15:25,064
The winner!

890
01:16:12,057 --> 01:16:14,130
Best wedding I was ever at.

891
01:16:44,745 --> 01:16:47,329
It's raining. What's gonna happen
to our cotton?

892
01:16:51,235 --> 01:16:53,693
Sure is a bad time
for rain to come.

893
01:16:55,607 --> 01:16:57,262
Better get us all back inside.

894
01:16:57,876 --> 01:16:59,757
No good for us to get wet.

895
01:18:30,181 --> 01:18:30,974
Sam!

896
01:18:31,924 --> 01:18:32,925
Sam!

897
01:18:34,658 --> 01:18:36,032
Sam... wake up!

898
01:18:44,173 --> 01:18:45,997
We've got to go home!

899
01:19:34,024 --> 01:19:35,592
Oh, Sam!

900
01:20:14,695 --> 01:20:17,018
I ain't gonna stay here
a minute longer.

901
01:20:17,509 --> 01:20:19,718
Not even a decent place to sit.

902
01:20:20,939 --> 01:20:26,135
I'm gonna take this old carcase direct
to the cemetery and await my Maker!

903
01:20:30,973 --> 01:20:34,008
I never thought you'd treat
your old granny like this!

904
01:20:35,356 --> 01:20:37,277
Sam Tucker...
You're a criminal!

905
01:20:49,072 --> 01:20:49,990
Granny!

906
01:20:52,607 --> 01:20:53,537
You stay here!

907
01:20:54,381 --> 01:20:56,140
Times like this,
folks got to stick together!

908
01:20:56,489 --> 01:20:58,715
You'll stay here
with the rest of us!

909
01:20:59,752 --> 01:21:00,594
Hey, Sam...

910
01:21:02,044 --> 01:21:03,994
Boy, it's good and ruined Tim.

911
01:21:07,568 --> 01:21:09,889
Well... gotta go find Uncle Walter.

912
01:21:12,612 --> 01:21:14,621
Alright... I'll stay...

913
01:21:14,622 --> 01:21:16,845
Coz you're trappin' me
like you always do!

914
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,249
You're strong, and you're the boss.

915
01:21:21,202 --> 01:21:25,618
What can an old decrepit granny do
agin the likes o' you?

916
01:21:25,619 --> 01:21:28,849
Come on... back to the house...
we got work to do.

917
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,111
Where do you reckon
she might be?

918
01:21:46,112 --> 01:21:48,779
Ain't no tellin...
But I just gotta find her, Tim.

919
01:21:49,614 --> 01:21:51,613
Pasture down there by the river
is all under water.

920
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:53,663
Sure hope she ain't in that river...

921
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,679
Ain't no cow worth gettin' drowned for.

922
01:21:56,557 --> 01:21:57,921
Not asking you to help, Tim.

923
01:21:59,521 --> 01:22:00,907
I'll go with you.

924
01:22:38,135 --> 01:22:39,273
There she is!

925
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:44,524
I'll go over and get her.

926
01:22:44,525 --> 01:22:45,899
Why don't you wait
until the water goes down?

927
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:47,152
The river'll never stop rising.

928
01:22:47,153 --> 01:22:48,471
OK boy, I'll give you a hand.

929
01:23:44,821 --> 01:23:45,938
OK?

930
01:23:45,939 --> 01:23:46,956
OK, boss.

931
01:23:46,957 --> 01:23:48,152
OK... I'm goin' on alone.

932
01:23:48,153 --> 01:23:50,149
Oh no... I'm goin' along with you.

933
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:51,096
You'll stay here.

934
01:24:00,759 --> 01:24:02,239
Sam!...

935
01:24:09,290 --> 01:24:11,862
The current!... Help!

936
01:25:16,297 --> 01:25:18,056
- OK, Tim?
- OK, boy!

937
01:25:36,675 --> 01:25:38,677
I'm comin' to town with you, Tim.

938
01:25:39,708 --> 01:25:42,057
Gather up my measly belongings
that's left...

939
01:25:42,058 --> 01:25:44,388
and pack up my whole bunch
and get out!

940
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:47,549
All them fields and trees and the river...

941
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:49,168
I just can't look at 'em no more!

942
01:25:49,169 --> 01:25:51,107
I give 'em everything
I had to give... honest!

943
01:25:51,108 --> 01:25:52,551
And what did they give me back?

944
01:25:52,552 --> 01:25:53,538
Nothing.

945
01:25:53,912 --> 01:25:55,778
Nothing but trouble and misery.

946
01:25:56,958 --> 01:25:58,480
Be crazy to stick any longer...

947
01:25:58,481 --> 01:25:59,892
A fella ought to know
when he's beat.

948
01:25:59,893 --> 01:26:01,242
When he ain't wanted on the place

949
01:26:01,243 --> 01:26:03,322
ain't nothin' for him to do
but to pack up and get out!

950
01:26:03,323 --> 01:26:05,628
Come on... let's go.

951
01:26:35,193 --> 01:26:36,550
Sam!

952
01:26:36,551 --> 01:26:39,556
I can hardly believe
the house is still standin'.

953
01:26:43,241 --> 01:26:46,418
Sam, your gun is safe...
and lots of other things, too.

954
01:26:47,132 --> 01:26:50,060
Most of Jotty's vegetable jars
are still whole.

955
01:26:50,061 --> 01:26:51,582
Of course, the pictures
got kind of broke...

956
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:54,618
But once I get 'em hangin' straight
on the wall, they won't look so bad.

957
01:27:01,481 --> 01:27:03,852
Course, the worst thing of all
was the stovepipe...

958
01:27:03,853 --> 01:27:06,958
But I got it back up again,
and I think it'll work alright now.

959
01:27:07,770 --> 01:27:09,133
How do you like that, Sam?!

960
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:11,565
I like it fine, Honey.

961
01:27:12,463 --> 01:27:13,337
Hey, Sam Tucker!...

962
01:27:13,338 --> 01:27:14,643
You know what this 'minds me of?

963
01:27:16,146 --> 01:27:19,820
'Minds me of 43 years ago,
with your grandpappy, Fayette.

964
01:27:19,821 --> 01:27:22,437
Same thing happened to us.

965
01:27:22,438 --> 01:27:23,931
Only worse... much worse.

966
01:27:25,458 --> 01:27:27,804
Our roof come clean to the floor, and...

967
01:27:27,805 --> 01:27:29,831
our walls just plum caved in.

968
01:27:30,194 --> 01:27:34,103
For a week we crawled in and out
on our hands and knees...

969
01:27:34,104 --> 01:27:36,022
like prey goin' down their holes.

970
01:27:36,925 --> 01:27:38,589
Oh, my fan!

971
01:27:42,134 --> 01:27:43,904
Old Fayette... he said...

972
01:27:44,451 --> 01:27:45,959
Never mind, Sugar...

973
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,385
It could've been much worse...

974
01:27:47,386 --> 01:27:49,472
if the Indians attacked it!

975
01:28:06,353 --> 01:28:07,181
Sam...

976
01:28:07,182 --> 01:28:08,290
Yeah, what is it, Tim?

977
01:28:08,291 --> 01:28:11,033
You said you was comin' to town
with me.

978
01:28:12,373 --> 01:28:14,813
Yeah... yeah, I said it.

979
01:28:15,564 --> 01:28:17,770
You said it, but you ain't comin' now, eh?

980
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:20,011
I was so plum wore out for a while...

981
01:28:20,012 --> 01:28:22,127
I didn't seem to believe
in nothin' no more.

982
01:28:22,648 --> 01:28:24,338
But now my clothes are startin' to dry...

983
01:28:24,339 --> 01:28:25,578
I'm beginnin' to believe again.

984
01:28:26,354 --> 01:28:29,023
I guess that's the way the earth feels,
when she's wet.

985
01:28:29,024 --> 01:28:31,465
But the sun'll start dryin' her out...

986
01:28:31,466 --> 01:28:34,903
And she'll start callin' to me again
just the way Nona does sometimes.

987
01:28:37,398 --> 01:28:39,864
I knowed it all along,
you'd never leave this place.

988
01:28:40,892 --> 01:28:43,614
If there was only one farmer
left on this earth...

989
01:28:43,615 --> 01:28:44,791
It'd be you.

990
01:28:45,293 --> 01:28:46,340
Crazy kiddin', Tim!

991
01:28:46,341 --> 01:28:49,161
Them machines o' yourn... they're fine...
I realise that.

992
01:28:49,162 --> 01:28:50,361
But you just can't eat 'em.

993
01:28:50,362 --> 01:28:54,171
Once in a while, you gotta have a
hunk 'o beef and a few ears o' corn

994
01:28:54,172 --> 01:28:55,820
to fill up your belly.

995
01:28:55,821 --> 01:28:58,080
Oh, you city folks are mighty smart...

996
01:28:58,081 --> 01:29:01,070
But I'm afraid without us farmers,
you'd get kinda skinny.

997
01:29:02,126 --> 01:29:05,040
And without us workers,
I just wonder what'd happen to you all.

998
01:29:05,903 --> 01:29:08,950
You're plough... sure didn't grow
on no tree.

999
01:29:08,951 --> 01:29:12,242
And your gun that you feed
your bunch with in the winter...

1000
01:29:12,243 --> 01:29:14,699
You didn't plant no seeds to get that.

1001
01:29:15,848 --> 01:29:18,094
Some day, like I hope
you get you a tractor.

1002
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:20,218
Where do you reckon that'll come from?

1003
01:29:22,006 --> 01:29:25,493
Believe me, friend... it takes all kinds
to make up this whole world.

1004
01:29:26,403 --> 01:29:27,436
You love your farm.

1005
01:29:28,233 --> 01:29:29,692
That's right. You stay.

1006
01:29:29,693 --> 01:29:31,673
I like to work in a factory.

1007
01:29:31,674 --> 01:29:34,644
And that's why I come
to take you back with me.

1008
01:29:37,424 --> 01:29:39,540
Well... you know what I'm talkin' about.

1009
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:42,705
I don't mean no harm...
I'd just like to help you.

1010
01:29:43,707 --> 01:29:46,239
Yeah... I know, Tim... thanks!

1011
01:29:49,274 --> 01:29:50,934
Coffee's all ready!

1012
01:30:00,977 --> 01:30:02,457
I want honey! I want honey!

1013
01:30:02,458 --> 01:30:04,430
Boy, nothin' could taste better
than this!

1014
01:30:04,921 --> 01:30:07,963
I think this is the first time you've made
anything out of that old pot

1015
01:30:07,964 --> 01:30:09,459
that was fit to drink, Nony!

1016
01:30:10,318 --> 01:30:11,780
Thank you, Granny!

1017
01:30:17,252 --> 01:30:18,197
Thank you, Honey.

1018
01:30:47,045 --> 01:30:49,123
Tomorrow I guess we'll be through
with the ploughin'.

1019
01:30:51,157 --> 01:30:54,399
As if we ever get through
with the ploughing!

1020
01:30:55,080 --> 01:30:59,830
I'm goin' back to the house, and just
sit... and wait for my call to glory.

1021
01:31:05,136 --> 01:31:07,999
Yeah... spring's gonna come
a little early this year, Honey.

1022
01:31:09,178 --> 01:31:12,179
Yeah, I reckon we can start our seedin'
even before the twentieth.
