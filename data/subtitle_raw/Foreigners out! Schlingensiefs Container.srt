1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,960
ln the year 2036, 100 years away from now ,
the things to come, l see them well,

2
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:17,960
The times today, they cease to matter.
It's better to look onto the past,

3
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,960
The world once more will be past a war,
which somebody had won somehow.

4
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:41,960
AfteM/ards all will claim peace again,
until they're armed to repeat again.

5
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:43,040
Being victim and part of the national
socialists as well

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,520
ou may very well picture for yourself how it
Iools in the middle ofVienna

7
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,040
Austria very quickly developed into
an independent democratic republic.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,920
The social and the Christian democrats,
SPÖ and ÖVP,

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
proved to be the mo parties to build
one of the most secure,

10
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,040
but also one of the most over structure
nations in the world.

11
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:59,040
Mid-eighties. The FPÖ, a German oriented,

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,960
nationalist party built out of Nazi remains
after WW2, became the third power.

13
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,960
Fourth of February 2000: the beloved
image of the country

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,920
ofwaltzes shatters in the face
of the world.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,960
ln 20 minutes the inauguration will be over
and the new government will be functional.

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,960
According to article 70 of the federal
constitutional court, l declare you,

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,920
Dr. SchÜssel, federal chancellor.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,960
Against his own election promises
and against the outspoken will

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,000
of the president, chancellor Wolfgang
SchÜssel goes into coalition

20
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,920
with the openly xenophobic FPÖ-party .

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,960
Yesterday night Vienna once again has
seen numerous protests,

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,960
demonstrating against the FPÖ
getting to be state officials.

23
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,920
Activists have stormed famous
Burgtheater and Hotel Imperial.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,960
You may very well picture for yourself
how it looks in the middle ofVienna.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,040
The FPÖ-party under the leadership of
Jörg Haider had developed into a

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,520
global symbol for Europe's turn
towards the e_reme right.

27
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,000
Stop asylum abuse! Stop the infiltration!
Right now FPÖ

28
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,960
Resistance

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,040
Despite being protected by massive squads
of armed policemen, the new government

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,960
did not dare to step up the imperial palace
in public, but preferred to enter through

31
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,960
a subterranean passage.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,960
With the inauguration of the new government,
the sanctions against Austria by

33
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:25,960
all other European Union states
are effective.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,960
With this act the EU threatens
their own member.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,040
A congressman in Brussels states:

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,960
Should we wait until they're building
concentration camps again?''

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,960
Vienna bemeen 1 1th and 17th of June.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,960
The local cultural institution ,,Wiener
Fesmochen'' invites infamous German shock

39
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,960
director Christoph Schlingensief
as their political statement.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,040
lnspired by the reality TV-show ,,Big
Brother'', he builds a concentration camp

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,960
like container right beside Vienna's
opera, the main tourist site of the city .

42
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:07,960
6 web cams watch melve real asylum seekers
imprisoned there for the entire week.

43
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:16,960
Via Internet gaming you can deport
these people out of Austria daily.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Kill Europe! Foreigners out!

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,960
An event by Christoph Schlingensief

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Please love Austria!

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Vienna downtown, June 1 1th 2000, 9 P.M.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,960
_.foreignersout.org

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The container is coming! A serious situation!
Pick your own foreigner! Give him your vote!

50
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,960
Deport''

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,960
Throw mo of them out of the country daily!
Deporting has started!

52
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,000
Christoph Schlingensief: l would like to
use this occasion to explain the rules

53
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,960
of the game: Tonight, only a few minutes
away, a dozen asylum seekers

54
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,000
will be transported into this place.

55
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:32,000
For the given time, they will remain in
the living room right underneath me,

56
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,920
in mo sleeping containers
and a small open yard.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
At the back is a sanitary container
with toilets and showers.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Some of them will stay in here for
six full days.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,920
Every day - dear Austrians,
l am talking to you now-

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
you will be able to vote for your most
hated foreigner in here.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,960
And by phone and web you will be able
to throw them out of your borders.

62
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,920
The results will be publicly announced
every night at 8 pm sharp.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The concerned foreigners will be driven
directlyto the borderline and deported.

64
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,960
Claudia Kaloff Project manager
of Schlingensief:

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,960
The idea was so e_reme to swallow.
Putting real asylum seekers into a

66
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,000
container right at the time of that huge
''Big Brother''- boom!

67
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:19,960
You just pack them in and the whole
population or half of Europe are able to

68
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,960
vote them out! l just thought: What an
incredible stroke of genius!

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,960
Matthias Lilienthal
Dramatic advisor of the container

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,960
l guess the worst moment for the foreigners
was, when they stepped out of the bus.

71
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,000
Walking through the screaming hordes of
people. 500 or so.

72
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:57,040
10 cameras and 30 photographers
opposing them.

73
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:05,000
An experience l myself had not encountered

74
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:09,040
before except by watching television.

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Leila comes first, please!
Out at the front, please!

76
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,000
Do we make it? Yes?

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,960
Anita, read the second bio! Please!

78
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,920
l wish all of you good luck
in the name of Europe!

79
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,960
And now we will unveil the sign, the
soon-to-be motto for all tourists here,

80
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,960
For all those passing by:

81
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Dear Japanese! Dear Frenchmen!

82
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,920
Dear Belgians! DearAmericans!

83
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,960
Please take many pictures of this place!

84
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
Please take them home with you!

85
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,960
Show all your relatives and friends
what is going on in Austria!

86
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,040
Show them the future of Europe!

87
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,960
Tell them: this is the truth!
This is the FPÖ!

88
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,960
This is the Krone Newspaper!

89
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,960
This is Austria!

90
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,040
Herewith l declare the event as started!

91
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Foreigners out

92
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,920
lf l just had screamed it,
it would have been different.

93
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,960
lf l scream ,,Foreigners out!'', Then it's
just a somebody screaming ''Foreigners out!''.

94
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,960
You may say, what an asshole
and that's it! l also did that!

95
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:09,920
But it is something completely different,

96
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
when this sentence becomes irremovable
like an election bannerjust standing there.

97
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,960
And you can't do anything against it.
And the entire sympathizers crawl

98
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,000
out oftheir holes and cheer
like freaked out madmen.

99
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,720
Press conference of the ,,Wiener Fesmochen''

100
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,040
Wednesday, June 6th 2000,
Shortly before the event

101
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,960
Luc Bondy - Head of
theatre festival ,,Wiener Fesmochen'':

102
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,920
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen!

103
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,960
We stated it before and l'll be
saying it again clearly:

104
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:45,040
l do\code(01f9)t feel comfortable to live in the
only country in whole Europe,

105
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,000
where a conservative party
has broken the taboo

106
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,960
to take a party
of the e_reme right

107
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,000
with them to be the government.

108
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,440
And l'm pe_ectly sure,
that the ,,Fesmochen''

109
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,920
need to be a space
for political discussion.

110
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,960
When such things happen, you need room to
openly think about all these procedures.

111
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,920
The way things develop,
the world ca\code(01f9)t afford any individuality.

112
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,960
That's not on the schedule. That's why
those asylum seekers just have to be black.

113
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,960
Have to be drug dealers.
Have to be homos. Have to be assholes.

114
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:41,960
You just need to be black and - wham! -
That's enough!

115
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,920
Simple key signals!

116
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,920
lf you seriously think about the news,

117
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,040
where UMTS-licences for 99 billion bucks
pass hands daily,

118
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,960
what can the little man with his sorry
wages do of any importance!

119
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:55,960
There's no relation anymore.

120
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:59,000
He will just think: ''Hell! There's one guy

121
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,000
in the world paying 99 billion
for that shit.

122
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,040
Maybe with my monthly 1 .OOO l could,...''

123
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,960
But then due to lack of real money ,
he needs a substitutional currency.

124
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:12,960
And that currency must be
payable in any place in the world.

125
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,960
He must be able to sit anmhere.
To punch on the table, saying:

126
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:18,920
Black must go!'', so everyone
will get it!

127
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,960
And these are the languages
that are understood very fast!

128
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,040
That's why l'm
completely against the opinion,

129
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,960
that what Jörg Haider does
is an intelligent act. It is not.

130
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:34,960
lt is simply
a substitution currency.

131
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,920
And even in a married state,

132
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,920
those in the Congo lands
do all belonging to a black.

133
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,960
Todays chosen is tomorrow's trashed one,
if he wants to want another one well

134
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:54,960
And even body care is no trouble with her.
She needs no silken gown.

135
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,960
No fresh bought hat.

136
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,960
lf she disgruntles him,
he's gonna guzzle her:

137
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:05,960
Congo niggers live life a pretty way!

138
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,920
Kathi Gruber ''Wiener Fesmochen'' -
productions team:

139
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,960
The container reached from here to
the barrier with bicycles over there.

140
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
We need to question, what these drug
dealers have done to our children!

141
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,440
How many families have they ruined?
How many kids have they destroyed?

142
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,920
This must be our direction.
And that's why we, members of the FPÖ,

143
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,040
are the guarantee for every man to live
calm and secure lives in this country:

144
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,920
And l am sure, many have understood,

145
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,960
how cheaply it has been tried to
criminalize the campaigns ofViennàs FPÖ.

146
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:13,960
Just because they have outspoken, what burns
in the heart of every good V iennese man:

147
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:17,960
there must be an end to foreign immigration!

148
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,920
Burghart Schmidt, Cultural philosopher:

149
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,920
The political situation,
pinned down in here, was obvious:

150
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,960
For the first time in Europe, a
government was built including a party

151
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:40,960
party that was fostered and built
on connections to the e_reme right:

152
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,920
Dr. Helene Partik-Pablé
Parliamentary deputy, FPÖ

153
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,920
The FPÖ party never involved itself
with xenophobe politics.

154
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,960
We never said ,,Foreigners out!'' All we did
was to maintain political responsibility!

155
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,920
We always said, Austria
is no country suited for immigrants.

156
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,040
Therefore we need a drastic limitation,
so any civil integration gets possible

157
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,960
in the first place.

158
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,920
At that point it was pledged that
Austria is no immigration country,

159
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,960
despite that this statement completely
contradicts the country' s history.

160
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,960
lt always was an ironic ''bon mot''
to hint at Vienna's phone book,

161
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:18,960
the kind of names you find in there.

162
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,000
So this broke Austrian traditions
by the same politicians,

163
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,960
who were talking about their
historical commitment.

164
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,040
This is the new way, ladies and gentlemen!

165
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
This is ''Foreigners out!'' This is Vienna!
This is Nazi! This is you and l!

166
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,960
This production is given to you by the FPÖ
in association with the Krone Newspaper.

167
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:44,040
This is a production of the FPÖ,

168
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,040
whohere presents their
up-to-date model for sewage plants!

169
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,960
This is the new we are giving to you!
You may now walk right in here!

170
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,920
Step in, ladies and gentlemen!
Get inside the peepshow!

171
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,960
Pick and watch your very own
asylum seeker! It's absolutely free!

172
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,960
The FPÖ party in association with
Krone Newspaper brings this event to you!

173
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,040
This is the newly opened Nazi film factory!

174
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,960
The pictures that Europe wants will be
produced here!

175
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:21,920
You are now in resistance,
Iadies and gentlemen!

176
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,960
You also! You are now officially
commissioned to resistance! Yes, you!

177
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,040
l declare you know to the of ficial
resistance at 3:20 p.m. Sharp!

178
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,040
You are now officially commissioned
to resistance! Resistance fighter!

179
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,960
Gabi Kaiba ''Wiener Fesmochen'':
The first mo days were quite peaceful.
Just like we were expecting to happen.

180
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:46,920
lt was weekend. No work time.
Vienna was sleeping.

181
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,040
Nobody had freaked out yet.
There was no press coverage:

182
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,960
Except the Krone Newspaper.
But theyjumped on it immediately:

183
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:00,960
Correct. Theyjumped on it.
But only in small at the beginning.

184
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,960
We have been betrayed and sold out

185
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,960
German lessons for foreigners?

186
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,960
Strict actions against loafers

187
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This is a thing that must be
put on the table openly:

188
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,960
behind every bigger movement in Austria,

189
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:24,960
there is Hans Dichand and
his Krone backing up.

190
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,960
Actionist tries to build
container camp besides opera

191
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,960
German ,,actionist'' provokes in Vienna

192
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,920
Dearest tourists! Please make
pictures! Foreigners out!

193
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,960
Krone Newspaper and the opera!
Send your postcards around the world!

194
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,000
Show them what's happening
in good old Austria!

195
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,920
Land of the Nazis!
Land of the fascists!

196
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,920
Here is Nazi central!
Here refugee camps burn every night!

197
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,960
Here blacks, Africans, all kinds
of people are murdered with ease.

198
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:53,960
Tourists are o.k.
They are delivering the cash!

199
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:58,960
They won't be prey to homosexual,
drug addicted blacks anymore!

200
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,960
We got _ustria! foreigners out!
Away with'em!

201
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,920
With transportation cars away!
Away with'em!

202
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,960
We're _oin_ to kill 'em all! Heads o_!
Omicial executions in public!
This is the place!

203
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:21,480
Every day execution of 20 to 30 foreigners!
Cut the heads off!

204
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:27,960
The square of heavenly execution!
The square of divine execution!

205
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:29,960
Sure it's easy
to misinterpret the whole thing!

206
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:32,000
But l have not the least of understanding,

207
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:34,040
for the whole bunch of peace activists

208
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,960
and those charmingly
sweet resistance fighters.

209
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,040
l just don't get their way.

210
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,960
When l am bugged by something,
when something just doesn't seem right,

211
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:53,960
l need to disturb the picture,
presented as the wholesome and right one.

212
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:58,960
The whole container-thing
was a machinery to disrupt images!

213
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,960
We only need Austrians! Nothing else!

214
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,960
This was no voyage to discover how stupid
the Austrian really is!

215
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,960
This would have been idiotic!

216
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,040
We gotAustria!

217
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,000
What was revealed through this form of media
installation, was how this ''dirt plastic'',

218
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:45,040
as Sloterdijk says, worked to gather
people like a force field.

219
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,960
Like all the dirt that suddenly appears
in the TV ads when the chamois is near.

220
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,960
Houellebecq was here!
And finally here we have her!

221
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,920
A resistance fighteress!

222
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,960
From now on you are a resistance fighter!
We have got 6:30 p.m.!

223
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:04,960
l officially declare you resistance fighter!

224
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,920
No violence please!
Even if there are some slight Nazi vibes..

225
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,960
There! There! There is something
in the bushes, ladies and gentlemen!

226
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,960
ls there something hidden?
Is there something inside the head?

227
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,920
Does it give you a ring?

228
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,920
Are the eyes flashing
are there strange crosses in the eyes?

229
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,920
l see something! This is film,
Iadies and gentlemen! This is film!

230
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,960
This is the future! We produce the pictures
that Austria definitely does not need!

231
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,440
l know the surroundings of Karajan Square

232
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:43,920
out of the shopping zone of Kärntner Street

233
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,920
And usually the only hindrance
is the masked opera people,

234
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,960
selling their tickets there, trying to up
the class culture level.

235
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:59,960
And suddenly we had an
unexpected cross traffic here.

236
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:03,960
All stops were pulled and it
developed a maelstrom fast.

237
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,960
Two must leave every evening.
Two all the time.

238
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,920
And then?

239
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And the last one will win!

240
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,960
The last nigger carries away 70.OOO bucks!

241
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,000
No Austrian?

242
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,480
You also want in?

243
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,760
Yes! Oh, yes!

244
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,000
Yes? Just go in!

245
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:38,960
This must be a joke!

246
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,960
Armin Thurnher, Austrian jounalist:
Regarding foreign politics
of that moment the main activity of the

247
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:48,000
Austrian government was to get
rid of the sanctions. To prove innocent

248
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:52,000
so to speak. Just at that
exact moment, Schlingensief staged this

249
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:57,000
event to hold a mirror up towards Austria,
to prove that some kind of guilt existed.

250
00:20:57,079 --> 00:21:02,000
ln a situation when my native nation
is ridiculed in front of the whole world.

251
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:07,000
When everybody wants to see what
really happens in this country

252
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:12,040
ls this now a fascist state or not?
Then it is my duty as a responsible

253
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
politician. To cover up any impression
of that... Because it's simply not true.

254
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,920
We have violated no convention,

255
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,960
so the European economy can't
put no sanctions up on us!

256
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,480
Now they have
pulled it out their bilateral Asses.

257
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:33,960
And then they cancelled
all political receptions.

258
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:39,000
So it's completelyjustified
when our government now takes

259
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:43,000
it the hard way by saying:
Just a moment!''

260
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:47,000
lf our government
isn't allowed to negotiate with

261
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:51,040
Germany, France or Belgium
In preparation of conferences of the

262
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:55,040
European economy - then we
haven't got enough intellect to do so,

263
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,000
but then we also won't be able
to vote with them and we will need our

264
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:01,960
expanded share of time
for essential decisions!

265
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:05,000
Then the whole eastern
expansion process will be put on wait!

266
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:11,000
And completely right so!

267
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,920
So now we will initiate
an act that is real!

268
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,040
l'm saying it again! This is a
pe_ormance of the ''Wiener Fesmochen ''!

269
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:27,040
This is an actor!
This is the absolute truth!

270
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:31,040
The results have arrived!

271
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:34,040
lt is a man from Iran,

272
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,960
Jahansha Alvandi, who has been
voted out of our country today .

273
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:40,920
Then security please comes in.

274
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,960
Two of you guys please come in
and carry him away to the car .

275
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:30,000
Well, that has been the dramatic scheme
of the container.

276
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,960
This container had started like a
picture on the wall.

277
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:37,920
Then suddenly it flooded the crowds
like the yeast of a cake.

278
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,960
So you were stuck right in there, couldn't
fall over anymore. Enclosed in bemeen.

279
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:45,960
So you stepped into a movie right at the
moment of filming without a possible reversal

280
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:50,000
You stood in that film, which was
your very own film.

281
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,960
Not my film. Not the one
of Mr. Schmitz or Mr. Bondy.

282
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:01,040
Referring to it as a market conscious term,
we had basically built a ,,product'',

283
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:05,000
that independently perpetuated itself
like a virus in the body

284
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:08,920
This is the ideal product the
whole economy is searching for.

285
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,960
Which you have to introduce only once and
which then spreads like a snowball system

286
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:17,000
on its own.

287
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:27,040
Jörg Haider: We also believe those hundred
thousands illegal aliens in this country

288
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:32,040
carry no right to remain in this country!
Therefore they have to leave this land by

289
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,960
our will, if they are proven delinquents!
Cause we don't want to breed crime!

290
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,960
Rainer Laux
Head of German ,,Big Brother'' TV-production:

291
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:45,040
Big Brother indeed was a new kind of
television you really felt it,

292
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,920
this was something new.
It hadn't happened before.

293
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,480
Observing people 24 hours a day,
Watching TV in the TV. It suited very well

294
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,000
at that time to oppose ,,Big Brother''.
With the word of human dignity on your

295
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:59,960
lips cause you knew it would immediately
be headline, in TV and radio.

296
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:03,960
lt simply was fascinating!
You could look right into a normal live!

297
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:07,920
There was a living room, a garden.
A bedroom like in any average home.

298
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,960
A little bit bigger. In a slightly
different style. But principally the same.

299
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:15,960
And you had the chance to innocently peek
what people are doing.

300
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:18,920
Morning till night.
24 Hours a day.

301
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,960
The people in this house
were completely authentic.

302
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:27,920
Though they were in a staged environment,

303
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,040
their lives in there were
completely credible.

304
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,040
Daily German lesson, late forenoon

305
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,920
l had the idea to work with containers
for a very long time.

306
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
A container already appeared in one of my
movies, ,,Terror 2000'' in 1992

307
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:02,920
which featured the visit of a camp
of asylum seekers,

308
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,960
where l realized for the very first time
that 8 people would seriously live

309
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,960
together on 18 square meters
including kitchen hole and toilet outside.

310
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,960
And the ugly news about this pop up over
and over again.

311
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,960
That ,,Big Brother'' hysteria was worth nought,
cause these things had been there forever .

312
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,960
Also that refugee camp beside the opera
was there a long, long time ago.

313
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,960
ln a far more violent and realistic form.

314
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:30,040
Christoph Maria Schlingensief. Son of a
druggist. Born the 24.10.1960 in Oberhausen.

315
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:34,000
His artistic method: the subversive
combination of popular narratives like

316
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,920
Big Brother'' with real socio-political
problems.

317
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Since the mid-eighties he creates films
in the German underground scene.

318
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:46,040
Getting more and more respected
in the art circuit, he expands the

319
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:50,920
screen into reality in the mid-nineties.

320
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
The theatre ''Berliner VolksbÜhne'' is his
permanent home since 1997.

321
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:59,000
An anarchist TV-talk show and several
public pranks make him a headline item.

322
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:04,000
But with the real and overpresent
election process of ''Chance 2000'',

323
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:09,000
an art party supporting social losers,
he overthrows himselfwith the media and

324
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:13,960
gets trashed as political clown.
The ,,Wiener Fesmochen'' are the first ones

325
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:17,960
to invite him again to work in an
established cultural setting.

326
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:21,000
Carl Hegemann, Chief dramatic advisor
VolksbÜhne, Berlin:

327
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:25,000
ln the beginning l was very sure
this would flop.

328
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:28,920
l thought this would be too obvious,
too intended.

329
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,960
Everybody would feel preached to, cause
everybody would know

330
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,000
what this whole thing really is about.
And then those would just say:

331
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:39,520
What the heck! We love foreigners anmay!
And it all would have puffed into hot air!

332
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,000
lt should have occurred to me differently,
cause these Schlingensief-stories always

333
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,960
work the crowd somehow.
But still l was e_remely surprised,

334
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:50,040
when all of a sudden the whole Austrian
population seriously took part in that play .

335
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,520
The first deported

336
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,000
Vienna embarrassed

337
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,920
Monkey biz theatre

338
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,040
Our country turned cartoon

339
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,920
Certainly,
concerning the themes of xenophobia,

340
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,960
the Austrian media situation, media politics
- he just had to throw a stone into that

341
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:15,920
water and count the waves.
But how many waves that would be

342
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,920
and how big they would get,
was the thing that really interested him.

343
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,960
and when some others started throwing their
rocks, he as the prime initiator

344
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:27,960
might have been delighffully thrilled,
what will come out in the end.

345
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,960
He certainly tried to direct in bemeen,
but without an unbiased view

346
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:35,960
it would have been impossible
to stage this thing.

347
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:40,960
lf you pe_ectly direct it through
and through, it's D.O.A. from the start!

348
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,960
This is the magnificent banner they keep
hanging here for mo and a half days already!

349
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,960
lmagine: the coalition you have voted for ,
keeps a slogan like this in public

350
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,960
for mo and a half days now!
Since mo and a half days the ÖVP and FPÖ

351
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,920
do nothing to put it away!

352
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,960
How damn stupid this coalition must be to
keep this hanging for mo and a half days!

353
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:07,000
This is the question we have to ask
ourselves again and again:

354
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,040
Why ca\code(01f9)t we take this coalition seriously?
They have to end?

355
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:15,000
They absolutely have to end?
In this instant!

356
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:17,960
Dr. Richard Schmitz
Ex-chief ofVienna's first district, ÖVP:

357
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:21,960
He is a terribly
skilled marketer of himself!

358
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:28,000
And there are media believing he will
achieve something really big some day!

359
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:30,000
lt was like this.

360
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:34,000
When he was at the Wolfgang-See,
with all those unemployed,

361
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:40,000
there was nothing at all.

362
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:44,000
But l was surprised
at the press coverage.

363
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:48,000
lt was well photographed.

364
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,920
Mag. Heidemarie Unterrainer
Cultural spokeswoman, FPÖ

365
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,040
Schlingensief is a puppet!
You take him out of the dusty agitation

366
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:01,920
closet and tell him: Hey! You! Do that!

367
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You'll get that mission: Make pictures
ofAustria that pull Austria into the dirt!

368
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,920
Boutique owner sues invaders

369
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,040
Schlingensief storms shop.
It was like a terrorist attack.

370
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,960
Excuse me, but what are you doing here?

371
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,920
Oh, that is beautiful!

372
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
But you should have waited!
Please turn off that thing!

373
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:08,040
Please call the chief
of the first district immediately!

374
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:12,000
l have kindly requested -you-
to stop filming!

375
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,960
For how long people keep whining that there
is no relevant political theatre left?

376
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:22,920
People just don't get such stuff anymore.

377
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,040
lt's just blank boredom on the stages,
missing any message connected to life.

378
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:29,040
This evidently is what links all
Schlingensief-events together.

379
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,520
They invent situations that admit
no clear understanding.

380
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,960
You can't clearlyjudge for yourself
what is happening here.

381
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:38,920
That's why l completely refuse the idea,

382
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
that this was an exemplary
demonstration of fascism.

383
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:44,000
lf itjust had been that way .

384
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,960
Then people with the ,,right'' consciousness
would have been able to shape up to it.

385
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,000
This method basically reaches
back to Karl Kraus

386
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,960
and what Walter Benjamin
analyzed about Kraus:

387
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,040
That you don't need to comment
to articulate criticism.

388
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:05,000
lt is way enough to simply cite
what you criticize.

389
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:09,040
The quotes just need to be placed in the
right position at the right time and place.

390
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:13,560
Then suddenly a simple citation
becomes self-revelatory!

391
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,040
l simply don't get it,
how they aren't able to understand!

392
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,960
All over the world there is war
and we are supposed to donate!

393
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:24,960
There is money given to those
who hunger and whoever else!

394
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,040
All over the world there is war
and nobody does something against it!

395
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,960
And here they freak out about this!
Am l stupid or what?

396
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,920
The lady has said it:
all over the world there is war

397
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,040
and people freak out over here,
just because people are deported!

398
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:44,000
This is fully correct! War is evermhere!

399
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,920
Turks and Yugoslaves!
They are overpopulating us!

400
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,960
This is our problem! That's not their
intelectuals joining us here!

401
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,000
lt 's the waste that's coming up,
who won't even appreciate us!

402
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:02,000
You can't blame the ones coming!
You have to blame the politics!

403
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,920
This is the problem!

404
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,960
You can't even tell, what you really want!

405
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:10,000
First the Turks, then the Yugoslavs,
then everybody else is ''the'' foreigner?!

406
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:11,920
We - are - overpopulated!

407
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Ain't right?
Just look at the schools!

408
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:19,000
That's bull!
What's your family name?

409
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:23,000
Duchkowitsch!
Yes, right! Milosevic Turkovic!

410
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:25,960
OfYugoslavian heritage...

411
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,960
Austria has picked their votes.
The election lines per phone

412
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,960
were used for real
and not the least, so to speak.

413
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,920
Sandra Umathum, Long-term companion
to Schlingensief-events:

414
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,920
After all Christoph just picks up the things
that happen in society anmay .

415
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Everybody knows a ,,Foreigners out!''- Sign!
Everybody knows, there are refugees in

416
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,960
containers out there at any time,
just waiting for deportation.

417
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:53,920
Perhaps a lot of people see this play
as being cynical,

418
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
disregarding the fact that the ruling themes
in media, in society,

419
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,040
cannot be surpassed in their cynicism.

420
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,960
Who are the dirty pigs authorizing this?

421
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,000
l am Austrian! But l am for the foreigners!

422
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:19,960
My wife is half of a foreigner! In Paris
they say already: Aha! It's correct!

423
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:22,000
ln Austria there are the Nazis!
Foreigners out, they say there!

424
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,000
Where is the ladder!
l'll be taking this down! Tomorrow?

425
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:33,000
Please don't submit to this, you all!
Am l free? Do you want to arrest me?

426
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:36,000
Because l'm protesting,
you really want to arrest me?

427
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,960
What kind of lawjustifies this?
You have got identification?

428
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:05,960
Kosovo! Shit! Broken!

429
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:09,960
Dr. Peter Sloterdijk, cultural philosopher:

430
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:14,920
The age of shock is over!

431
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,920
The epoch has gone, where a cultural
avant-garde could work with surprises

432
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,000
and attacks on an unprepared nervous system.
In Germany we just have lived through

433
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:30,920
the Big Brother- hysteria,
where an elimination game

434
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
became the center of all things.
But as soon you drop that frantic collective

435
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:42,920
need to have a winner
so you don't cherish the gladia!tor and

436
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:50,040
you don't cheer the European soccer master ,
but move that mechanism of elimination into

437
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:56,920
the light, that's where things
start to get thrilling!

438
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:04,040
There you can see how society daftly
participates in the production of losers!

439
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:11,000
Because the production of a winner includes
the production of an

440
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:17,040
uncountable number of losers!

441
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:35,960
He has said: This is art!
What? This is supposed to be art?

442
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:38,920
This is a fucking hoax on Austria!

443
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,520
We have not burned down any refugee homes!
Not like in Germany!

444
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:48,040
We may be talking stupid...
Austrians may be talking stupid...

445
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:52,920
But we don't burn down any homes
or something like it!

446
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Tomorrow it will be all over the headlines..
Somebody tried to start a fire!

447
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:03,000
You are helping us?
So l get upset and can't sleep at night!

448
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:05,920
Because you put something like this up here!

449
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,960
You are an enemy to Austria
and you have to be deported!

450
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:15,000
This government realizing was not
in the least a democratic act!

451
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:18,920
Mister SchÜssel has promised before
the election started,

452
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,960
lf he would finish the third,
he would take his party into opposition!

453
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:29,960
By this he tried to lure those voters,
who for whatever reason

454
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:34,960
Tried to prevent the FPÖ
entering the government!

455
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,480
Who had voted for Haider
at least knew what he bargained! with!

456
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:43,960
Who voted for SchÜssel
had been betrayed to the highest degree!

457
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:45,960
ls this really your only potential?

458
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:50,000
To articulate any resistance! This is a
sorry ass demonstration of incapacity!

459
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,000
Yes! These are our problems! Not yours!
You don't need to put this up over here!

460
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,960
This is a European problem!

461
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:01,520
Here no asylum seekers burn
like in Germany!

462
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:05,000
They are laughing at us in other countries!

463
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,920
Zib3'', midnight news show of ,,ORF''
Tuesday, 13.6.200O

464
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,960
Well, Mr. Schlingensief! The Viennese people
are embarrassed! The tourists are shocked!

465
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:31,000
We have heard that! We have seen that!
These are the headlines of tomorrow' s

466
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,040
newspapers! and not only of the ''Krone''!
Is this what you wanted?

467
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Provocation is a means for morons!
That's what the FPÖ is aiming for!

468
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:41,520
With a provocation,
l provoke you and then l just leave.

469
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,040
Different to that the container
also works without me.

470
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:47,960
You'll recognize that
when you're passing by!

471
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:50,960
Ms. Unterrainer, you are the
cultural spokeswoman of the FPÖ!

472
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,000
ln a release you are writing,
Mister Schlingensief is mentally disturbed!

473
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,000
Do you feel provoked?

474
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:57,960
l do not feel provoked at all
by Mister Schlingensief.

475
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:01,960
But it is symptomatic that provocation
has become a method of cultural politics.

476
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:07,000
We refuse that. Same as we refuse child rape
violence per se and themes like blasphemy.

477
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:12,000
We do not consider this as art.
Here art only becomes a disguise for...

478
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:16,960
What you are doing here is just
spawning public hatred!

479
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,960
Just take your slogans!

480
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:22,000
You may provoke at your container thing
but not here in ORF-TV

481
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,920
Here at the ORF it is my turn! Not yours!

482
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
You have people in the government,
who are responsible for this isolation.

483
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,960
You should try getting elected
as a politician, huh!

484
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:35,960
Helmut Salcher, ÖVP: You just do your play!
l won't step into that trap!

485
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:39,000
l won't be acting in your play!

486
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:42,000
The fear grows! The fear grows!

487
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,960
l have to inte_ere here!

488
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,960
ln this moment, Austria is a
completely ridiculous country.

489
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,920
An absolutely ridiculous,
Iaughed at population!

490
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,920
Tonight there has been an incident again.
Three people invaded the container

491
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,040
for the second time! And there was a little
fire attack right at the front entrance!

492
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:18,040
What is close ahead of us, concerning
globalization to a high degree

493
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:23,040
is the danger of technocratic economist
fascism of a complete new kind,

494
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,960
which leaves behind
all its old characteristics.

495
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:33,920
This could be a form of totalitarianism,
which is completely different.

496
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,440
ltjustifies itself out of the increasingly
Iethal dangers of all the technology

497
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:42,960
in use as well as out of the globally free
access to the delights of pure economies.

498
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:48,000
The punch line is: If you really want

499
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,960
all of your consumer pleasures,

500
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
we have to completely
control and observe society!

501
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,960
lt had been assumed by Schlingensief, that
the foreigners are just a new currency

502
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,960
for the Nazis. Another idea was, that
the entire e_reme right was just some kind

503
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:14,960
of business trick. Obviously with Haider,
who just uses it as a market gap.

504
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:19,960
There is a potential client ship in Austria
that has to be grassed off.

505
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:25,920
He may catch their votes as result
of a business move:

506
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,960
But yet, that's trivial.
It may be less trivial with all that

507
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:36,920
xenophobes who bet on that
horse as they keep looking

508
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,960
to realize an idea by doing so,
which hasn't been realized yet:

509
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:44,000
You just throw that hate-thing into the
market and strive to make it big time.

510
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:48,000
And if society resists it,
then they'd just let go for the ne_.

511
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,000
Elfriede Jelinek:

512
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,960
We have written a play together.
l somehow got the idea to let them

513
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:02,960
write down sentences in German.
Sentences they had heard many times before.

514
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:08,000
So we assembled it together into
a punch-and-judy kind of thing.

515
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:14,000
l am Miss Heidemarie Unterrainer, M.A.

516
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,000
Tomorrow l will come and eat humans!

517
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:28,960
Finally l am the chancellor!
l love human beings!

518
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,960
l love Austrian human beings!

519
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:37,960
l don't want the war!
We need nothing but humans.

520
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:42,960
We live in Europe with Europeans.

521
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:47,920
Our biggest wish is to become actors.

522
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,960
Please help us with this possibility.
Thank you!

523
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:57,920
Everybody wanted to see the product ,,man''.

524
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,960
What had been the actor of a TV series or
Liz Taylor on the big screen way back then?

525
00:44:04,039 --> 00:44:09,960
Now were Mister Smith and that pussy
from the beer pub cross the street

526
00:44:10,039 --> 00:44:15,960
Who became visual as human goods?

527
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:21,920
They gave you the feeling, that it doesn't
matter how stupid you are, you are worth

528
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
at least something.
But then again we could discover
via ,,Big Brother'' and that was a thing

529
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,000
also Mr Laux very painfully had to learn
with the flop of ,,Big Diet'':

530
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:36,000
The interesting thing in the
product ,,man'' isn't its su_ace.

531
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:42,000
lt is not to be conceived
as a kind of capital, but far deeper.

532
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Counter-statement by Vienna's mayor
Dr. Michael Häupl, SPÖ: This is not reality.

533
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:51,000
This is a game. Adangerous
game with emotions. Austria is different!

534
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:00,920
We are approaching
the deportation of the day.

535
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
This night not three will be brought away,
as we had planned. No! Two will be deported!

536
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:12,000
Today number three is leaving us.
Wole from Nigeria! A black man again!

537
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:18,000
Austria has voted out a blackie once again!
Look at that consequence!

538
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:24,000
What a continuous process this all is!

539
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:31,960
Today the lady from Iraq and
Wole from Nigeria will be gone!

540
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:47,000
We have reached the fourth day today!
The sign is still hanging!

541
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:50,960
The coalition can splendidly live with it!

542
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:55,960
The super stupid Austrians
have voted a super stupid coalition!

543
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:59,040
That's the way
things look right at the moment!

544
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:12,960
He shall come out, if he dares to! Who' s
gonna take this down? l can't reach it...

545
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:18,960
And for the rest it's far too dangerous!
Those Krauts always start these things!

546
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:31,000
The century of socialism
was a century of crime!

547
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,440
Those who already stay here,
shall remain here...

548
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:40,760
And they shall have equal
rights to the Austrians.

549
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,000
OtheM/ise there is going to be
a war bemeen us!

550
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,000
We want to have our peace!

551
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
The only real surrealist deed possible
is to randomly shoot into a crowd.

552
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:59,520
lf this is a form of radicalism,
it has worked here in the end.

553
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:05,000
You could not hear the shot.
But an incredible lot of people

554
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:08,960
were stumbling around heavily wounded.
Screaming ,,ouch''. Hollering.

555
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,960
The family Garzaner
Permanent guests at Schlingensief-events

556
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,960
Here we have Mario, Kurt and Ilse Garzaner!

557
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:24,920
You have called us to participate!
Why? What do you have to tell us?

558
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,960
We very much enjoy this event and...
We have accepted the guest patronance...

559
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:32,960
This is a piece of shit!

560
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:36,920
Those are all actors!

561
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,920
Kick out the Krauts! Foreigners in!

562
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,960
This is no art! Who's putting up this filth!
This is warmongering!

563
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:52,000
Foreigners in! Kick out the Krauts!

564
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,000
This is a very significant gesture!
''Our pride is loyalty!''...

565
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,920
...l have no idea at all
where that sentence comes! from!

566
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Aren't you even allowed to raise your arm
nowadays, without being called a Nazi!

567
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,920
What a bunch of morons!

568
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,960
l was pleasantly surprised,
that all these people on the street

569
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:14,960
started to discuss their politics
in connection to the event.

570
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:17,920
That really was good.

571
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,960
But when it suddenly cooked up
in the summer heat,

572
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,960
when it turned really hot and aggressive,
l got scared shitless for quite some time.

573
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:33,000
Just tell me one precise example
Where this Austrian government

574
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:37,960
since its formation has committed a crime
against the human rights.

575
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:42,000
Where they have invited any racist hatred!
If you could kindly tell us just one example

576
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,480
in front of these microphones...
But you can't!

577
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,920
You've got right-wing
populists in your government.

578
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,040
There are racist slogans all over the place,
which come directly from this government.

579
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:58,000
Who afteM/ards just tell:
''Oh my, we didn't say - that!''

580
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,960
Haider is not part of the government!
Is the FPÖ in the government or not?l

581
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,040
But that's bull!

582
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,960
You are one of those artists suckling on
state money and those artists now

583
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:14,960
scream the loudest in fear they won't get
anything any more!

584
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:19,960
And that's why this woodshed,
these moron chants...

585
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,960
Does St.Stephan's cathedral please you?

586
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,520
l think St.Stephe\code(01f9)s is a beauty!

587
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,760
Do you know how it was financed?

588
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,960
Possibly...Maybe...Could be...

589
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:31,920
By subvention money!

590
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,960
Yes. But today the whole art...

591
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:36,000
Subventions have always been there.
You know?

592
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,960
Yes. But then you can't...

593
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:40,000
And St.Stephan's cathedral
also still is there!

594
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,960
l only felt scared of these things
happening once on the Friday.

595
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:48,960
Standing on the roof l thought of a sudden,
the way things happen right now

596
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:51,960
with all these calls and threats...

597
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:56,000
lf this really was a movie,
there is place in the story for a sniper

598
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:00,000
on the other roof or someone
making a drastic example

599
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,040
Everything could have happened.
There could have been an attack at any time.

600
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:07,000
Everything was possible.

601
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:10,520
We didn't know at first,
that itjust was butyric acid.

602
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,960
But after these acid attacks,
l mean, they could have used

603
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:15,960
something really harmful.

604
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:19,000
Something that leaves
permanent damage on the people in there.

605
00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:25,000
l found his behavior completely
irresponsible to himself.

606
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:31,960
Standing there fully exposed.

607
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:39,000
The whole project appeared
to be unprotected from all directions.

608
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:41,960
You are against foreigners?
Why are you against foreigners?

609
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:49,960
Ouch!
It can't be the same bottle all the time?

610
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:56,000
Haider is not an asshole!
President Klestil is an asshole!

611
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,000
l'm inclined to open up a company...
l'm prepared to give work to foreigners

612
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,000
Who carry certificates to live here?

613
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:13,040
You German swine!

614
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,000
You artist!

615
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,960
This was no real job.

616
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:26,040
lt was like
living through a war zone, fighting against

617
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:30,960
the inside as well as the outside.

618
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:38,960
Amnesty international
would have done itdifferently.

619
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:45,960
This was no ai-thing!
This was no ,,show me your wounds!''- Project!

620
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:52,960
lt wasn't that we wanted to get
green cards for all melve of them.

621
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,000
ln some aspects this venture
was swinish to the highest degree!

622
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:02,000
Gregor Gysi, German politician, PDS

623
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,040
Krauts out!...Krauts out!...Krauts out!

624
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:19,520
There is no negative energy!
There just is energy!

625
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:24,000
And now l welcome
our honorary guest Gregor Gysi!

626
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,920
Well, hello to you,
dear Viennese women and men!

627
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,040
Dear guests of the city! Dear friends and
...Enemies!

628
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:39,000
This signifies our level of tolerance.

629
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:43,960
Schlingensief is a provocateur.
This is for sure.

630
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:48,000
and many now heat up to his provocations.
This also is for sure.

631
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,000
But let me state my opinion:
the only real provocation in our time is

632
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,520
that we still have to deal
with late traces of the Middle Ages!

633
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,040
And these traces are any form
of racism and xenophobia today!

634
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,960
This is what we have to leave behind!

635
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:06,960
Please police!

636
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:12,040
Viva international solidarity!

637
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:17,960
Nazis out!
Free the refugees, please!

638
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:22,920
l really felt scared when
the activists stormed the container.

639
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Theyjust crashed in with that hippie-idea in
their heads: We need to free those people!

640
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:33,000
They didn't get it, that it was
serious what we played out there.

641
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:39,000
And then you just could see their urge to
destruct. Sure it is understandable.

642
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:44,920
We definitely had used
the crudest statements to provoke.

643
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,960
But l was really in fear
that this could suddenly end very badly.

644
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,960
Let them free!

645
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:19,000
Let us say clear and directly:
1-2-3, let them free!

646
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:44,000
They were all in e_reme heat.
Those people crashing in.

647
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,960
lt was all just a big brawl of screams and
fighting. You had to keep in the background

648
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:51,920
You were beaten, torn and pushed.
for not getting punched.

649
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,040
Such a peaceful being like me
l just thought, should l run away?

650
00:54:58,039 --> 00:55:02,960
And the situation was how to get them
down from the roof again,

651
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:07,960
before it breaks in and 20 or 30
of them have broken legs or worse.

652
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,440
l have witnessed it myself, when the
weekly Thursday demonstration stepped

653
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:26,960
into the Schlingensief-trap with
their activists completely off the chain.

654
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:32,480
At once they started to demonstrate
for a clean Austria.

655
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:37,920
They cleaned Austria
by destroying the revelatory stigmata.

656
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,040
l conceived that as very frightening. That
these people are ruled by certain blindness,

657
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:46,960
so they cannot see
what they are really heading for .

658
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:50,960
And that their roles
are immediately changing

659
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,960
when they step into the public stage.

660
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:58,960
They acted out of the intention
to reconstruct the image of a clean Austria.

661
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:02,960
Notjust simply some Austria,
but the image of a purified Austria.

662
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:08,000
So up to a point they acted on
the same level as the Krone Newspaper did,

663
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:13,000
wanting the same outcome.

664
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,960
Free the people!

665
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:27,040
The people really are frightened in there!

666
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:37,960
After the activists were standing on top
and inside of the container

667
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:43,000
l negotiated that six of them should build
a delegation to talk with the refugees.

668
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:48,040
Then those six came and held speeches:
We want to liberate you!

669
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:53,040
We want to bring you freedom!
We are from the anti-fascistic front!

670
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:55,960
Now they all will be freed!

671
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:07,960
The refugees have to be
evacuated out of security reasons.

672
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:18,000
Deportation is murder!
Deportation is killing!

673
00:57:58,039 --> 00:57:59,040
Are they all away now?

674
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,960
The liberation of the refugees has happened!
And it was not the government freeing them!

675
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:09,960
lt was the population!
Therefore l am thanking all of you! Bye!

676
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:23,000
Resistance!

677
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:35,000
lt may be embarrassing
for the Viennese resistance groups.

678
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:38,960
But the reality is,
that this event had initiated

679
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:43,000
much more political fuzz then they managed
to raise in mo previous months of protest.

680
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:47,520
After a furious beginning the demos
had withered more and more.

681
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:52,000
And no ideas to build the protest
for new were happening anymore.

682
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:53,000
Does this mean, all is finished now?
Was this the finale?

683
00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:11,040
May we leave some flyers? What's up now?

684
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:16,000
ls everything over? We insist you come to

685
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:21,040
the demo ne_ Thursday! The embassy for
weary citizens down at city hall!

686
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,440
Cause we had the container
there a lot earlier!

687
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:30,720
Since the February 9th!
You just have to come!

688
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:34,960
We also will be there!
But we have to ask mommy!

689
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:40,960
This is our new home anmay!

690
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:50,960
The whole event here was to bug the FPÖ
in the first place, right?

691
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:55,480
So they would say:
Our flag is parading from such a shithive?

692
00:59:55,559 --> 01:00:00,000
And now those, who are against
this party, pull it all down!

693
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,000
l screamed around like mad:

694
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:06,520
You'll do the FPÖ a pleasure,
when you're taking that away!

695
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:10,000
They have become part
of the play without recognizing it.

696
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:12,960
Or perhaps they even recognized it.

697
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:17,920
But they never got it, that
this whole event was against the right.

698
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,960
Yes, that was the provocation
like Christoph has said: How long can this

699
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:26,000
sentence survive in public!
It wasn't really meant that way , right?

700
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:30,920
Foreigners out!
This was only a provocation... To check out

701
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
how long may this keep hanging! And our
government stupidos have accepted that..

702
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:39,920
Without getting it.
But then the demo gloriously...

703
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Yeah! But isn't it much better to keep
this picture up for a full ten weeks

704
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:47,960
to oppose the government
instead of tearing it down? It's stupid!

705
01:00:48,039 --> 01:00:51,000
Freedom for the refugees?
When they get out of here,

706
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:54,040
what kind of freedom,
you think, will be there to find?

707
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:57,040
They thought you would kill them!
What was on your minds?

708
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,960
They don't know no German!

709
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:03,960
All that screaming out there!
The hullabaloo!

710
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:08,920
The fighting all around! They thought,
this would be their end!

711
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Are you the leader of this bunch of
imbeciles? Not one leader's left of them

712
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:17,000
anmay, ey? Just a bunch of bored idiots,
destroying everything in sight!

713
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:21,000
Oh, we just wandered down
Ballhaus-Square as as we heard the people...

714
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:25,000
Deciding to storm the container.
And l just said: let's look what happens!

715
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:28,960
And then it took eternities until the demo
started marching. And l just said:

716
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:31,480
l really need to watch this now
and so l went there!

717
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:34,000
And 15 minutes later the demo
happened to pass by!

718
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,040
The Indians stormed the buildings.
The refugees had fled. The event had ended.

719
01:01:38,119 --> 01:01:41,040
lt would have been
the biggest mistake to do it that way!

720
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,960
Please pull it more towards the middle!
There is a double ''s'' in there!

721
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,960
That looks like SS!

722
01:01:52,039 --> 01:01:55,040
lt's not good for Austria, when people can
see that SS-people are living here!

723
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:59,040
The SS-insignia are forbidden!
Don't ever let SS be read up there!

724
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,040
They will claim we did that on purpose!

725
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:10,000
We had to somehow try to maintain
autonomy in bemeen all these positions.

726
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:15,920
Bemeen the left, that patted on your back.

727
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,960
Bemeen the right,
who wished you god knows where.

728
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:29,000
lfwe had terminated the event at this point,
we would have played the joker to the lefties

729
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:38,040
And l don't want to permit
a self-deceiving demonstration culture

730
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:43,960
the right to the finale.
You just have to wreck that.

731
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:49,000
ln the morning it was...
l can't even remember what l did that night.

732
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:54,920
lf l had dreamed at all.
Normally l dream a lot.

733
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,960
But at that morning l woke up and
couldn't even reach my slippers.

734
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,520
lt cracked and crumbled underneath my skin,
like l had completely dried out.

735
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:08,000
There was nothing in there anymore.
Then l dragged myself back to the square.

736
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:12,920
And when l arrived there,
pure hell was happening.

737
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,960
The whole thing had restarted.
It was the need of this thing.

738
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:20,960
lt was this fast breeder.
It was this power plant.

739
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:25,040
These fuel rods deep inside Vienna itself.
It didn't want to be shut down.

740
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,920
Schröder and Chirac were
kissing all overjust yesterday!

741
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Despite not knowing who's
the bigger one. Who's ruling the EU!

742
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:38,960
That's because there are
6 billion people on earth...

743
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,960
And only 8 million of them are Austrians!

744
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:47,000
And the 8 billion permanently
threaten poor little Austria!

745
01:03:47,079 --> 01:03:52,000
14 Countries had to front against Austria.
Isn't that embarrassing?

746
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:57,000
You may grease that Chirac-guy up your hair!
And that Schröder-guy, too!

747
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,960
This little country Austria.
Barely 8 million inhabitants,

748
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:05,960
Has welcomed more foreigners,
more refugees and the ilk than Germany!

749
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:11,040
The ,,provoker'' just drinks liquor!
You should be learning your language, man!

750
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:15,040
But not your ,,classy'' German!
We talk our talk!

751
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,000
We've been lured enough already!
It's enough all right!

752
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:26,040
You won't get through language class and
then your citizenship will be terminated!

753
01:04:26,119 --> 01:04:29,960
Cause we're talking on the streets,
l'm talking like a prole!

754
01:04:30,039 --> 01:04:31,960
l'm talking like
my mouth is grown and l say:

755
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:35,920
Dear colleague, you can
fucking lick my butt hole!

756
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:42,000
You know what's the Viennese expression for
that? Kiss me in the valley of the winds!

757
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,040
So this is my closing statement
for this long day: God bless Austria!

758
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:51,040
The way it has been
told since way back then: God bless Austria!

759
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:05,960
For sure, there were people that said,
it would have been better;

760
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:09,040
this event had never taken place.
This is clear.

761
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:13,920
But to prohibit such manifestations

762
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,960
- l don't want to call this art -
would have been far worse than letting

763
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:23,000
things just go like they were going.

764
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:28,520
lf the Krone Newspaper
wouldn't have jumped on it,

765
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:33,760
the whole thing would have
drowned in the public mind.

766
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:38,960
Due to lack of provocation.
Due to lack of artistry.

767
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:43,000
l think, the Krone just explicitly
wanted to stake their claims on a clean

768
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:47,000
and properAustrian super nation.
Like the song in ''First April 2000'':

769
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:50,960
The sun shines for everyone the same!
WhyAustria is the one to blame?''

770
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,960
The Krone just wanted to make that
point clear, how they dominate the scenery .

771
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:58,920
And it doesn't fucking matter
if it's a SPÖ or FPÖ or ÖVP:

772
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,440
the Krone is the Krone and
that is the main party of the country .

773
01:06:02,519 --> 01:06:05,920
And whoever buys that paper
in the morning, votes for that party.

774
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
And there is nothing to stop that process.
This is the way l believe things to be.

775
01:06:09,079 --> 01:06:12,960
What we normally believe
to be the ruling power isn't.

776
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:16,040
Yellow press is the
only real party out there.

777
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,040
Foreigners out!'' is a
virulent instigation of the public!

778
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:24,000
l am sick of apologizing
to my friends from abroad,

779
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:27,960
that they can read
this ''Foreigners out'' up there!

780
01:06:28,039 --> 01:06:31,040
But you need not to apologize
for something that's true!

781
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:36,000
Foreigners out! Foreigners out!

782
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:39,960
You are a fascist lefty!

783
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:05,040
l reckon the most characteristic development
is, that the FPÖ-people have become

784
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:12,000
fashionable. They have got the power now.
They are all over the society pages.

785
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:16,960
They dominate the lifestyle mags.
They are the new idols.

786
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:22,960
Some years ago it has been just Haider ,
who was that sassily worshipped pop icon,

787
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:27,960
that bold little chap,
who dares talking back at any cost.

788
01:07:28,039 --> 01:07:32,920
Who bungee-jumps from the highest bridges.

789
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,040
The one fighting
against those with established power.

790
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,960
Now there have grown
a lot more of that specimen.

791
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:55,960
Daniel Cohn-Bendit, icon
of ''68'' and politician, ''The Greens''

792
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:00,000
We are dreaming. It's like
back in the fifties.

793
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:03,960
Art is central again
to political confrontation.

794
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:08,000
With an artistic idea,
that is deeply connected to reality .

795
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:11,960
These are real people.
These are real asylum seekers.

796
01:08:12,039 --> 01:08:15,920
Real illegals,
seeking official permission to stay.

797
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Europe has reacted emotionally, because
Europe couldn't imagine how it comes,

798
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:24,040
that 50 years past second world war
someone like this could openly participate

799
01:08:24,119 --> 01:08:28,040
in a civilized European government.

800
01:08:28,119 --> 01:08:31,960
This reaction of Europe is legitimate

801
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:38,040
and we would be disgusted
if Europe hadn't reacted that way.

802
01:08:38,119 --> 01:08:40,960
Honorable Mister Haider

803
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:44,000
we seriously want to invite you to
a conversation with the asylum seekers.

804
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:46,960
This date would
definitely need your participation

805
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:50,040
and is of greatest importance,
because it serves the communication

806
01:08:50,119 --> 01:08:53,920
and collaboration within Europe.

807
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,960
Cordially yours,
Christoph Schlingensief

808
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:02,000
After all we had also
offered the stage to Haider.

809
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,960
The Krone papers completely
shot off range with that.

810
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:09,960
lt only occured that there
would have been equality of arms.

811
01:09:10,039 --> 01:09:13,960
That was a setting
he could not accept by all means.

812
01:09:14,039 --> 01:09:18,960
Equality of arms for the first time.
And then he chickened out.

813
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:22,960
You got to believe that:
Haider had chickened out!

814
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:27,000
The Krone completely missed the point in
saying, this just was leftist group hysteria

815
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:31,960
the stage also was open to the
right-wingers. Even for the head of them

816
01:09:32,039 --> 01:09:38,960
lt then turned into a propaganda forum for
the left. But it was not intended that way .

817
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:45,960
lf Haider or Dichand had appeared,
with a delicate certainty

818
01:09:46,039 --> 01:09:57,000
they could have taken over the event
in an instant, within the blink of an eye.

819
01:09:58,039 --> 01:10:00,960
No African has a better life than here!

820
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:05,040
You liar! Just go to the prisons and look
for foreigners there! Down at Wasa-Street!

821
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:09,040
Cause they're stealing
and they're living from hash!

822
01:10:09,119 --> 01:10:11,000
Lies! All lies!

823
01:10:11,079 --> 01:10:15,000
When l go to Africa and open up
my mouth, l'll be killed immediately!

824
01:10:15,079 --> 01:10:17,960
You don't need to tell me any truth!

825
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:23,960
Everyday it's in the papers, what your doing
to the foreigners! Kill em off!

826
01:10:24,039 --> 01:10:28,000
No! That is a lie!l
Every day on television!

827
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:30,920
That is a lie!l
That is a lie?

828
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
That is a lie! Where did that happen?l
In Amica!

829
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:37,960
What country in _mica?
Yes! In your place!

830
01:10:38,039 --> 01:10:40,480
You don't live anmhere
as good as here!

831
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,960
qou definitely need to learn, my miend!

832
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:44,040
From you?
Yes! From me!l

833
01:10:46,039 --> 01:10:50,000
Democracy gets burdened very often.
And it is also said very often,

834
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:53,960
democracy will endure all of this.

835
01:10:54,039 --> 01:10:58,960
l also believe that.
And democracy evidently has endured it.

836
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:02,960
Also the Austrians have endured it.

837
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:07,040
But l keep asking myself,
if it's justified to throw another stone,

838
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:11,040
when Austria is under attack already?

839
01:11:11,119 --> 01:11:15,040
To add fuel to the fire?

840
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And to say afteM/ards:
Oh well, they will endure it anmay .

841
01:11:21,079 --> 01:11:25,000
Democracy?
That means decision of the majority!

842
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:30,000
Therefore it is completely democratic to
decide by majority to get rid of democracy!

843
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:35,000
A pe_ect thought by all logic!
But democracy is no formal logical term,

844
01:11:35,079 --> 01:11:40,000
but a term to cover up and
secure certain political social realities.

845
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:45,000
This is the slight difference.

846
01:11:45,079 --> 01:11:47,960
Straight on time,
the ne_ deportation is starting!

847
01:11:48,039 --> 01:11:50,520
And another one!
And another one! And another one!

848
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,280
All goes down in a pe_ect flux!
We have to rush,

849
01:11:53,359 --> 01:11:55,960
before the demo comes
round the corner again!

850
01:11:56,039 --> 01:11:59,000
Thank god, you buzz off again!
Away to your Kraut brothers!

851
01:12:00,039 --> 01:12:02,920
You won't stop us!

852
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,000
You are the loser!
You are a discontinued model!

853
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:12,000
Dearest friends! It has become clear now!

854
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:19,960
The opposition is growing
as the government is dying out!

855
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,960
l also want to be deported!

856
01:12:38,039 --> 01:12:45,000
l also want to be deported! l am Austrian,
but l also want to be deported!

857
01:12:45,079 --> 01:12:49,960
Please help me!
l also want to be deported!

858
01:12:50,039 --> 01:12:58,000
You goddamned bastards!

859
01:13:02,039 --> 01:13:08,000
Everybody talks about well-respected men.
The little ones are for-got-ten.

860
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:15,040
About big artists, papers write and write
and write. Little men never get in sight.

861
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:21,920
All raves about the big,
but the little men shtick never gets a kick

862
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Something must happen for the little man!
Without help he won't uncan the can!

863
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:35,040
He can't help the little man fuzz!
If he could, he would be big like us!

864
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:43,960
Doesn't the gentleman fit your acting
concept? Could we please hear his speech?

865
01:13:44,039 --> 01:13:49,960
There is no deportation today!
There is no deportation!

866
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
This is the real violence!
Your violence!

867
01:13:57,079 --> 01:14:03,000
Deportation is over!
,,Foreigners out!'' is over!

868
01:14:03,079 --> 01:14:10,040
There is no deportation today!
,,Foreigners out!'' is over!

869
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,960
And in bemeen
it all is you, my Schlingensief!

870
01:14:22,039 --> 01:14:25,960
Your touching tender looks!

871
01:14:26,039 --> 01:14:32,480
Your bright children's eyes, those know
no lie when looking onto this world!

872
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:38,960
That keep looking and looking and wondering,
what still exists out there!

873
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:42,960
What kind of understanding of art is it
to believe, artjust walks into the world and

874
01:14:43,039 --> 01:14:45,960
completely can alter it
for the good or worse of it.

875
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:49,960
lf this was the case,
then l am asking myselfwhy politics

876
01:14:50,039 --> 01:14:54,480
haven't replaced art a long,
Iong time ago.

877
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,960
Why haven't politics
gone into art business?

878
01:14:59,039 --> 01:15:02,960
Then all these representatives
can paint a nice picture.

879
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:04,960
They can tape it
on the ne_ poster pillar.

880
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:08,480
And l get enlightened
when l'm passing on my bike.

881
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,720
Every problem
in the world suddenly is solved:

882
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:14,920
No poverty anymore.
No polluted environment.

883
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,920
Just because those
nice pictures are hanging there.

884
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,960
What kind of delusion is this! This is
rubbish! This doesn't interest me at all!

885
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:24,000
l am interested to invite a multitude
of systems to gather in a dance.

886
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:26,960
And that dance becomes the picture.

887
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:30,960
And the picture will remain there!
For six or seven days!

888
01:15:31,039 --> 01:15:34,920
And it still will be there in 10 years
and in 100 years as well!

889
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,480
But if it changes the world or singular
persons is absolutely not relevant! Because

890
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:42,000
the ones asking for this to happen are the
ones who will never change anything anmay!

891
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:47,000
Ladies and gentlemen, we are from the FPÖ
and we say: ,,Foreigners out!''

892
01:15:47,079 --> 01:15:51,960
l am inviting all the tourists
arriving here: Photograph this poster!

893
01:15:52,039 --> 01:15:56,040
lt will keep hanging here
for another five hours!

894
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,040
Peter Marboe, Vienna's cultural councilor
and his fascist friends may still come

895
01:16:01,119 --> 01:16:05,920
and take this poster down!
We will not prevent it!

896
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,480
We will wait for him with open arms!
We will even help!

897
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,960
We will not say this work
of art ought not to be destroyed,

898
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:19,960
cause there is no work of art!
We will simply support the destruction!

899
01:16:20,039 --> 01:16:24,960
Still, five hours are left
and it is thrilling to see what will happen!

900
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:29,520
Will Europe keep this picture in its mind?
Will Europe say:

901
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:34,280
Yes. The coalition wasn't even able
to make a phone call.

902
01:16:34,359 --> 01:16:39,120
Just to express:
''O.k.! We want this sentence to vanish!

903
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:43,960
This is our goal!
We want to take this down together!'' No.

904
01:16:44,039 --> 01:16:47,960
The test is still running.
For five hours.

905
01:16:48,039 --> 01:16:52,040
Then we will all know
what this coalition in Austria really wants.

906
01:16:52,119 --> 01:16:56,000
And at this exact moment
the music comes to an end!

907
01:16:56,079 --> 01:17:00,000
What pathos! What a day!

908
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:10,000
To me Christoph is no manipulator of society.
Christoph is no ratter piping together

909
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:14,960
the people with
whatever pictures are at hand.

910
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:22,960
So that people just say yes and amen
and Schlingensief is our new ''Fuehrer''.

911
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:24,000
This is not the point.

912
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,040
l am never too sure how many vanities
are to be satisfied with this project.

913
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:33,000
How much artistic intention is in there?

914
01:17:33,079 --> 01:17:37,040
How much humanism and how much
care compared to the vanity.

915
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,920
l love glamorous people.
Pop culture gives me the kick.

916
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
l think it's great,
when they all dazzle and bath in vanity .

917
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:48,040
lf not, they should work in a bank, you know!

918
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,960
Thank you! It's an enormous
push foM/ard to encounter people like you!

919
01:17:54,039 --> 01:17:57,960
You have to immediately buy a FPÖ flag,
take it into your hand,

920
01:17:58,039 --> 01:18:04,000
walk through the streets and kick a tourist.
This is the method, ladies and gentlemen!

921
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:07,920
This is for free! Take a FPÖ sticker!

922
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,480
Take FPÖ whatever into your hand
and kick a tourist!

923
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:13,000
Give him a good smack and
tell him: ,,Foreigners out!''

924
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:16,960
Just do it!
And then you just kindly run away!

925
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,960
l am demonstrating!
l am against it! Against it!''

926
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:28,000
That's worth shit today! Resistance is over!
You have to produce contradictions!

927
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:30,000
Where do you come from?
Indonesia!

928
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:34,920
Tunisia? Hello! l am from the FPÖ!

929
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:39,040
Back there are mo Japanese ladies! See?
They both need their faces punched, ey?

930
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:46,000
lt is evident that the Schlingensief-stories
are e_reme social integrators because they

931
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,960
make it possible to integrate those people,
who are in deep danger to blow their top

932
01:18:52,039 --> 01:18:55,960
and start a large-scale terrorist
or nihilist political act.

933
01:18:56,039 --> 01:19:00,000
Thereby these tendencies get tied to
the comparatively safe art.

934
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:04,000
And that is why art is so magnificently
assimilated, where it seems

935
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:07,960
not conforming to society at all.

936
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:13,920
l am a little therapist here.
A little head doctor in the hospital.

937
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:20,000
And l am proud of that, to carry my patients
away from their lies for a short moment.

938
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:23,000
And then we can diagnose together .

939
01:19:23,079 --> 01:19:27,920
And we can judge
if there is recovery possible or not.

940
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,960
lf he was a social therapist,
then this whole enterprise has flopped.

941
01:19:32,039 --> 01:19:35,960
lt hasn't cleansed anything.
Yes, l know, how this is to be understood!

942
01:19:36,039 --> 01:19:39,920
This would mean a battle ofwords.

943
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,960
l conceive therapy as a term
for cleaning up, making healthy again.

944
01:19:44,039 --> 01:19:49,000
But this event only revealed something.
And this is more than we could hope for .

945
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Let's begin. German lesson.

946
01:19:54,079 --> 01:20:00,000
l am sad because l have problems!

947
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:05,520
l am sad because l have no food!

948
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:11,000
l am sad because l will be deported!

949
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:14,960
These are enemies against us!

950
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:16,960
Who is the bad one and who the good?

951
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:21,960
That Schlingensief is an asshole!
That's known since a hundred years!

952
01:20:22,039 --> 01:20:25,960
Just look at that name!
He's got v.D. in his brain!

953
01:20:26,079 --> 01:20:30,960
These are some Bavarian colleagues
Whom l am taking for a sightseeing tour.

954
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:35,000
l told them to really see the town,
We got to go right here!

955
01:20:35,079 --> 01:20:38,960
Here it is great! Here we got a rumble!
Here you get to know V ienna, right?

956
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:42,960
Yupp, here you get dead drunk
in the right winged students tradition!

957
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:44,000
That's not us!

958
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:47,520
The great passion of right winged
students is boozing up, right?

959
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:53,280
Yes! Correct! So the sorry rest of our brains
will be drunken away!

960
01:20:53,359 --> 01:20:58,960
Just look at that glorious German laugh!
You know the flatheads?

961
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:03,000
Down at the zoo! Schönbrunn!
Excellent!

962
01:21:03,079 --> 01:21:07,000
That's where you belong! Schönbrunn!

963
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:14,000
Just look at that ,,Foreigners out!''- Sign!
Who needs that?

964
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:18,920
ls that an ad for you Krauts?

965
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,960
You Kraut-friend!
You Kraut-friend!

966
01:21:23,039 --> 01:21:27,960
You Schröder-friend!
You Schröder-friend!

967
01:21:28,039 --> 01:21:31,000
Stoiber stands tall for us!

968
01:21:31,079 --> 01:21:32,960
Haider doesn't stand!

969
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:34,960
That one can fucking go to hell!

970
01:21:35,039 --> 01:21:36,000
Haider is falling already!

971
01:21:36,079 --> 01:21:42,040
You behave! If he were with you guys,
he'd be chancellor already!

972
01:21:42,119 --> 01:21:45,520
Hitler hasn't made it
over here, remember?

973
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,960
With you Krauts
he was chancellor immediately!

974
01:21:49,039 --> 01:21:52,040
Well, hasn't he got the
Ioveliest name on earth: Schlingensief!

975
01:21:52,119 --> 01:21:54,960
Maybe he just got
the clap in the head!

976
01:21:55,039 --> 01:21:58,920
lt didn't harm him at all.
The opposite was the case.

977
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,960
He now is the big hero in the spotlight.
The ,,Fesmochen'' also weren't harmed.

978
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:06,960
For sure it meant some damage to the
politicians permitting the whole thing.

979
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:10,960
Today at Viennese election time for example
you still get mail flyers of the FPÖ,

980
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:15,000
writing: we would not
have permitted this container!

981
01:22:15,079 --> 01:22:18,960
l am also for you staying here!
You are a Kraut, right?

982
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:26,000
So please treat us like Austrians! We are
the most peaceful population on earth!

983
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:30,920
Look! l think you can
judge that from pedagogics!

984
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,040
lf l continuously tell a child
that it is bad, that it is rotten,

985
01:22:34,119 --> 01:22:37,960
it may rebel for a short while.

986
01:22:38,039 --> 01:22:42,000
But if you still continue with provoking it,
then it may finally say: o.k!

987
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:45,960
Then l am bad and rotten, l guess!

988
01:22:46,039 --> 01:22:49,960
And it will not react to
anything else at all anymore!

989
01:22:50,039 --> 01:22:53,040
That is the case l also see here!

990
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,960
ln every other country you would have been
jailed and executed already!

991
01:22:58,039 --> 01:23:03,960
There you see what country Austria really is!
We are a country of culture, you know!

992
01:23:04,039 --> 01:23:07,920
Listen to Mozart! Go to the opera!

993
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:14,960
Get the damn back home to Krautland!
Go where you belong, you smart aleck!

994
01:23:15,039 --> 01:23:20,960
Certainly you have witnessed,
what l think is a positive thing.

995
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:27,960
That mo people that weren't at ground zero
of the event started to seriously

996
01:23:28,039 --> 01:23:30,960
talk with each other.
That also has happened.

997
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:34,000
Clearly a positive act.

998
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:43,960
EinstÜrzende Neubauten
German rock avant-garde band

999
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:06,920
ls tax money paid to remain silent?

1000
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:13,960
l think, taxpayer's money that is invested
into art is there for confrontation!

1001
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:19,040
Charles Ofuedo, Nigerian author:

1002
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
We all say: Art must be free! Shout it out
all of you! A-r-t m-u-s-t b-e f-r-e-e!

1003
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,920
Peter Pilz, Austrian politician, Green Party:

1004
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,960
About this container there is huge fuzz.
Not about Rossauer drive

1005
01:24:35,039 --> 01:24:38,000
and the Rossauer barracks 1 km from here,
where an artist doesn't stage these things.

1006
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:45,480
Peter Sellars
Theatre director, USA

1007
01:24:58,039 --> 01:25:02,040
And when a Peter Sellars suddenly screams:
We need this project in Los Angeles.

1008
01:25:02,119 --> 01:25:06,520
Well, then he should do it. But he doesn't.
He just screams and yells it.

1009
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:10,960
And also Luc Bondy, whom l respect a lot
and who unexpectedly discovers

1010
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:14,960
the political fighter within himself, but who
is all but gone right after the project.

1011
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:18,920
Then l have to say:
That's just the way it is!

1012
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:24,040
l won't reproach them for anything.
But the funny thing is:

1013
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:27,960
l had known all this to happen before!

1014
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:34,920
We are now approaching our
final deportation! l don't want to say much,

1015
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,960
but to remember you of the container
waiting here at Vienna airport. A container

1016
01:25:39,039 --> 01:25:42,960
full of real refugees, seeking asylum.
Waiting for their tough fate to happen.

1017
01:25:43,039 --> 01:25:47,040
And this container's not standing just here,
but all over Europe. Evermhere are people,

1018
01:25:47,119 --> 01:25:52,000
who are not permitted to stay
in the country they would like to stay in.

1019
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:57,000
And there are a lot of instigators.
People that put sentences up.

1020
01:25:57,079 --> 01:26:02,000
Certain sentences
that are said far too easily .

1021
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:07,960
With which people forget far too soon
that they had said them themselves.

1022
01:26:08,039 --> 01:26:12,000
Where they play surprised
that they have been said.

1023
01:26:12,079 --> 01:26:16,000
To put these sentences into reality ,
to make them real,

1024
01:26:16,079 --> 01:26:21,000
was the intent of this project.

1025
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,000
And the third one stepping inside the car
is someone that already spent

1026
01:26:32,039 --> 01:26:34,960
some time up here with us.
He will also have to leave this country .

1027
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:40,000
And there he goes: Christoph Schlingensief!
Finally he's gone! Thank you! Bye bye!

1028
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:48,760
And now the winner...

1029
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:53,760
the austrian's darling...

1030
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:58,760
Welcome, Ranil Shunta!

1031
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:17,960
You - come - come here!
You - won! From - people! 3.500 bucks!

1032
01:27:18,039 --> 01:27:24,960
Give a warm round
of applause to our big winner!

1033
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:31,040
This banner up there is like everything
in life that offers resistance - art!

1034
01:27:31,119 --> 01:27:35,040
We are all artists!

1035
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:38,560
The new government raises taxes and cuts
social, cultural and educational budgets.
As a consequence the FPÖ loses lots ofvoters.
The ÖVP in contrast achieves consistent to
increasing results.

1036
01:27:53,920 --> 01:28:06,320
ln November 2001 the university of Innsbruck
published a study on xenophobia in Austria:
Out of 2.OOO studied people,
220/o proved strong on xenophobia,
260/o as latent cases.
And 100/o even could be classified
as part of the e_reme right.
