1
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,792
Soft music

2
00:00:28,958 --> 00:01:05,292
- ... ...

3
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,625
-It's just that at the moment...

4
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:10,250
I do not have the means
to feed him and…

5
00:01:10,792 --> 00:01:13,375
you understand,
I don't want to abandon him.

6
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,875
I am offered a job
as a housekeeper in Switzerland.

7
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:18,125
-His first name ?

8
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:21,667
-I will be back. 

 have to believe me.
-Of course. His first name ?

9
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,208
-Ludwig.

10
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:27,250
--That's not going to make things easier for him.
Sign here.

11
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:34,500
- ...

12
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:37,875
Clicking heels

13
00:01:38,042 --> 00:01:42,167
- ...

14
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,708
- Honey, I will miss you so much.

15
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,542
I'll come back and we'll meet again.
I don't abandon you.

16
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,333
-Would you like to read me a page?

17
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:58,083
-You are old enough to read alone,
NOW.

18
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,667
And you know what ?

19
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:03,083
I will have returned from Switzerland
before you finish your book.

20
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,917
-When you are far away,
you will think about me ?

21
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,542
-I promise you.

22
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,000
My baby…

23
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:13,458
-Madam ? Please.

24
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:15,917
Sobs

25
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:20,083
- ...

26
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,375
-I love you very much.

27
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:24,292
- ...

28
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:27,042
She walks away.

29
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:29,958
- ...

30
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:33,875
-Maman.

31
00:02:34,042 --> 00:03:08,833
- ...

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,333
Mom, I'm done!

33
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,333
- ...

34
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,167
-THANKS. You come at just the right time, Ludwig.

35
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,417
Your mother sent you this.

36
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,125
Melancholic music

37
00:03:23,292 --> 00:04:02,917
- ...

38
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:05,333
-She sent me another book?

39
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:07,250
-Not this time.

40
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,000
Our establishment will close.

41
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:15,042
You will be placed in the countryside.

42
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,042
Valencourt Abbey.

43
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:21,125
-In the countryside ?
Mom, how will she find me?

44
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,458
-You don't need mom anymore
at your age.

45
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,667
There, you will make yourself
lots of new friends.

46
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:34,958
- ...

47
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,417
-I could at least
take my books?

48
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:42,250
- ...

49
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:44,167
-Here you are, my little one.

50
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,667
-Here we go, come on.

51
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:49,917
Bells are ringing.

52
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:54,000
- ...

53
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:56,042
-Give it to me !
You don't scare me.

54
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,708
-It's sure, you're a big one.

55
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,375
Finished, 
the cuddly toy.

56
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,375
He too will go through the window.
Say goodbye to him.

57
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:06,250
Look at the baby, he's going to cry.

58
00:05:06,417 --> 00:05:08,792
What are you going to do ?
Call your friends?

59
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,375
<i>In Valencourt, there are no friends.</i>

60
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:11,542
Cry of rage

61
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,708
-Get out, dwarves!
-Luigi !

62
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,375
Growls

63
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:26,042
- ...

64
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,667
-Do you think you are strong?
No room for 2 chefs.

65
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,542
-Then you better leave.

66
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:32,250
-Crush it!

67
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,042
Ruckus in the distance

68
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,750
Light music

69
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:41,417
-Help me !

70
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:52,000
- ...

71
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,542
Grate squeaking

72
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,125
The door slams.

73
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,708
-Our new resident
is puny.

74
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,833
-That will take half a mouth to feed.

75
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:06,458
You won't have to deprive yourself.
Dare to say

76
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:09,208
that you haven't thought about it.
-No, I swear.

77
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,583
-Are you swearing? Whoa….

78
00:06:12,208 --> 00:06:14,625
-Finally…
Welcome to Valencourt,

79
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:15,625
Ludwig.

80
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,375
I am Father Turpin.

81
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:21,500
This is your teacher, Mr. Leutellier.
-Delighted.

82
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:24,750
I see that the gentleman is a reader.

83
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:28,375
What wonders do you bring back?

84
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:30,250
Jules Verne.

85
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,375
Jules Verne. Encore Jules Verne.
Have you read them all?

86
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,792
-Yes sir.

87
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,125
-Which ones are your favorites?

88
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:41,958
-Those that my mother sends me.

89
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:45,125
Growls
Fracas

90
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:46,583
- ...

91
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,750
-Cleared !

92
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:52,792
- ...

93
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,333
-It's not all about the books.

94
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:58,500
Here, the practice of sport
is essential.

95
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:02,958
-As we can hear,
Abbe Turpin teaches the art of wrestling.

96
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,208
Cris

97
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,417
- ...

98
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,167
- Bastard!

99
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:12,792
-It seems that our residents have
looking forward to meeting their new friend.

100
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,250
So I'm going to ask you...

101
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,417
To ring the assembly,
my dear Mr. Leutellier.

102
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,708
-With pleasure, the abbot.

103
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,333
I release my arms to ring the bell.

104
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:26,375
Cris

105
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:28,250
- ...

106
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,583
The bell rings.

107
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,333
-Lets' go.
-It's not over, Octave.

108
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,667
-No, you're right.

109
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:36,917
It's not over.

110
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,250
Laughter

111
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:41,375
It's nice to empty

112
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:42,667
our chamber pots.

113
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,958
- ...

114
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,292
Come on.

115
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:04,250
-Ludwig is your new comrade.

116
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,083
I count on you
to give him a warm welcome.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,958
-Welcome, dear friend.

118
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,208
Laughter
-How nice,

119
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,667
lieber Octave.

120
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,375
But despite his first name,

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,083
Ludwig is French.

122
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,417


 is a tradition here,

123
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:25,875
to share his room
in alphabetical order.

124
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:30,708
Your dorm mates
will be Lucas, Luigi and Lucien.

125
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:33,875
-Where are they ?

126
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:38,750
-Lucas, Luigi and Lucien.
- Has anyone seen them?

127
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:41,292
Funny music

128
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,833
Laughter

129
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,917
- ...

130
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,417
Silence.

131
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,625
God... what else have you done?

132
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,375
-On a…

133
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,958
Stumbled while emptying our pots.

134
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,708
-Always the same.

135
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,125
Take it all away and go

136
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:09,000
shower.

137
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,792
Mocking laughter

138
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,083
- ...

139
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,792
-Charlemagne
is son of Pepin the Short.

140
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:22,042
He became king of the Franks in 768,

141
00:09:22,208 --> 00:09:25,625
then emperor from the year 800.

142
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:28,500
He marks his reign
for the sake of unification.

143
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:29,750
Please, basically.

144
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,917
Mr. Lucas, try to imagine.

145
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:39,875
When you observe the boundaries
of Charlemagne's empire

146
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:43,417
and those, more recent,
of today's Europe,

147
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,167
what a reflection

148
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,625
Does this inspire you?

149
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:50,458
Roh.…

150
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:56,500
Is there anyone…

151
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:01,208
Who would make us an offer?

152
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:17,292
Is there anyone who could fly

153
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,750
Help.…

154
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:22,708
Of our poor

155
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:23,750
Lucas ?

156
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:24,542
-Oh!

157
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,333
-If Charlemagne had stayed at home

158
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
without “conquering” that,
there would be fewer schools.

159
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,875
Laughter

160
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:34,042
-Conquer.

161
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,292
School is your sworn enemy,

162
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,875
M. Lucas ?
-The worst thing is not school.

163
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:42,208
These are the ones who go there.
Some, especially.

164
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:47,708
-You're starting to interest me.
What is an enemy?

165
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,417
-A Boche!
Laughter

166
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:55,375
-You probably wanted
talk about a German?

167
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,625
Octave,
to whom I did not give the floor.

168
00:10:57,792 --> 00:11:00,750
Tension music

169
00:11:00,917 --> 00:11:05,083
Observe the contours carefully
of Charlemagne's empire.

170
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,500
I am speaking to you, Octave.

171
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,208
There is no longer really
from France, from Germany.

172
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:13,583
So can you consider

173
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,750
than
whom you consider to be your enemy,

174
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:18,458
M. Octave,

175
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,792
because of a ridiculous border,

176
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,875
drawn by people like you,

177
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,208
could become your friend?

178
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:30,375
If people like Charlemagne
or myself

179
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:33,417
suddenly decided
to make it disappear?

180
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:37,042
-Sir,
why are borders moving?

181
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,875
-Why are borders moving?

182
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,208
Mainly because of the wars,
my poor Lucas.

183
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:49,083
-However, it's always the same.

184
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,083
-What ? Here, here and here?

185
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,208
-It's Switzerland.

186
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,875
A neutral country.

187
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,958
-Very just.
Bells are ringing.

188
00:11:58,292 --> 00:12:00,958
Ah, we'll talk about Switzerland
and the rest

189
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,292
the next time.

190
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:03,500
You close your notebooks

191
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:06,292
in the calm
on your desks.

192
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:11,167
Serious music

193
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,000
- ...

194
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:15,917
-Look at me, the Boche.
I'm watching you.

195
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:22,125
- ...

196
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:23,833
-It's just ink.

197
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:28,417
The choir sings the Alleluia.

198
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:49,875
- ...

199
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,917
-To celebrate the Almighty,

200
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:56,542
who sacrificed on this Easter day,
His only son,

201
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,417
and in remission of all our sins,

202
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,542
here are some oranges.
I will ask you to come….

203
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,000
One after the other…

204
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,333
Cheers

205
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,208
- ...

206
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,042
Calmly!
In calm and respect.

207
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:15,458
- ...

208
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,833
Remember James chapter 3,

209
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,417
verse 18. "The fruit of righteousness
is sown in peace.”

210
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:23,917
No, stop.

211
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,958
-Donne.
-With dignity!

212
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,292
Bunch of assholes!

213
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:33,708
It is a gift in honor of God.

214
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:34,875
It is necessary

215
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:36,292
one for each.

216
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,667
-He can multiply them, then.

217
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,167
-Be less sassy.

218
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:46,000
-Why not have taken
speech in class?

219
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,750
-I'm not like them.

220
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,833
♪ have a mother.

221
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,833
She is far away, but she thinks of me.

222
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:00,458
We are too different.

223
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,292
We'll never be friends.

224
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:07,708
-It was very necessary
to read Jules Verne…

225
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,333
Did you pretend?

226
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:15,125
Didn't he write: "Friendship
cannot exist between two beings

227
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:16,833
"perfectly identical"?

228
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,042
-Five weeks in a Balloon.

229
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,042
-What a memory.

230
00:14:21,708 --> 00:14:23,083
What should be remembered?

231
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,333
Than the difference
is infinitely more rewarding

232
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,000
than the resemblance.

233
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:32,375
-Do you have parents, sir?

234
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:34,375
-Oui.

235
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,458
- So why are you here?

236
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:40,875
-Uh well…

237
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:48,542
My mom and dad held my hand
when I was learning to walk.

238
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,625
But there are all kinds of ways
to walk.

239
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,583
So if I can extend my hand to you...

240
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,875
To help you move forward…

241
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,458
I know why I am here.

242
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,208
-You piss me off!

243
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,708
(-Do you want this hand
catch you an orange,

244
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,625
(or would you dare to go alone?)

245
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,500
-I can't stand you anymore!

246
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,250
Tomorrow,
be at 7 a.m. on the rugby field.

247
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,333
It is valid for all.

248
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Soft music

249
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:40,167
- ...

250
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,625
-Good night guys.
-GOOD NIGHT.

251
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,042
Ludwig cries softly.

252
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:56,292
- ...

253
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,208
-Standing ! Look at the treasure.

254
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,042
- Did you find a treasure?
-Quoi ?

255
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,542
- I stole them from Octave.

256
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,125
-I want one !
-Me first.

257
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:07,750
-It's me who decides.
-Wait.

258
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,042
We are four.

259
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,083
There are only three oranges.
How do we do ?

260
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm the biggest.

261
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,875
-Like always.
-I stole them.

262
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,208
-You're fat.
-Non.

263
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,792
-I decide.
-Oh ! You are not going to fight.

264
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,417
Do you know fractions?

265
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:24,958
Modern mathematics.

266
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,542
An orange is made
of four quarters.

267
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,708
3 x 4 = 12.

268
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:35,750
We are four.
So 12 divided by 4 equals 3.

269
00:16:35,917 --> 00:16:37,500
Everyone the same share.

270
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,208
-I did not understand anything.

271
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,458
-It would be easier

272
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,833
if I ate everything.

273
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,958
-And then the abbot is wrong.
It's not Easter Day.

274
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,042
It's Christmas.

275
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,333
-We even got gifts.
-The most beautiful.

276
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,750
What the good Lord didn't give us.

277
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:53,708
Brothers.

278
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,708
-Graduated tutoring. Lucas.

279
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,417
-Lucien.

280
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,000
-Luigi.

281
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:02,667
Happy music

282
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,083
- ...

283
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,000
-And Ludwig.

284
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:16,250
- ...

285
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,375
-They must return
borrowed books.

286
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,375
Some are unaware that they have pages,

287
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:26,083
they use it as a stepladder
to… steal jams from you

288
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,625
in your cellar.

289
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:31,250
And an essay.
They have to write.

290
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,042
Two pages minimum
with the use of the subjunctive.

291
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:39,500
I wrote everything down for you.
It's heard ?

292
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,125
-Yes. Jam and subjunctive.

293
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:42,667
-Voilà.

294
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:44,917
Tell 'em I'm gone

295
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:45,833
on holiday.

296
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,333
With family.

297
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,375
-I think you should
tell them the truth.

298
00:17:51,542 --> 00:17:54,792
They… They listen to you.
[They trust you.

299
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,708
-My dear little ones…

300
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:59,042
What do you want me to tell them?

301
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,792
That I am mobilized?
That I'm going to the front?

302
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,458
Why worry them more?
They are children.

303
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,417
This is not the case
only a few weeks.

304
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,958
-May God hear you.
-I'm sure He hears me.

305
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,458
I am not sure
that interests him.

306
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:18,042
-Don't overheat me.
You know I'm sanguine.

307
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,167
- We should send you to the front.

308
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,792
A lightning operation. Divine Lightning.

309
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,708
-Leave before you receive my lightning.

310
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:28,292
And take this. You will need it.

311
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,042
It's not going to bite you.
It's a Bible.

312
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:37,167
-How do you say ?
-A Bible.

313
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,792
Come on.…

314
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,042
Melancholic music

315
00:18:46,208 --> 00:19:06,042
- ...

316
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,000
-Hurry! Come on.
Did you hear things?

317
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,083
-Lots of things.

318
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:13,292
-What is happening ?

319
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:16,583
-He is carrying a suitcase
almost as tall as the abbot.

320
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,667
He got a lightning bolt on his forehead.

321
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:22,292
-Impossible.
-Yes, a flash. The big gray cloud.

322
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,042
So he goes on vacation.

323
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:26,208
-On holiday ?
-Vacation.

324
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,042
-In that case, so are we.

325
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,583
Let's go, come on!

326
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,458
-Wait for me, guys!
Hey, no one ever listens to me!

327
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,875
He sighs.

328
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:39,792
They forget me all the time.

329
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,958
Screams and laughter
Groovy music

330
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,542
- ...

331
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:45,875
...

332
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:47,375
-Youhou!

333
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,083
-Last to arrive
is a big slug!

334
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,208
- ...

335
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,750
-It's freedom !

336
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:57,458
- ...

337
00:19:57,625 --> 00:20:00,208
- No more school!
-Come on ! We are almost there.

338
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,000
-Why the Lulus
ever experience this?

339
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:05,333
We're going to make them pay.

340
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,625
-"You are the salt of the earth.""

341
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:09,042
- He annoys me!

342
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,917
-Come on, get the ball out!

343
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,333
Cris
Yes that's it !

344
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,625
- ...

345
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:22,125
- Ouh, it fucks the roustons.
-Here we are !

346
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:25,250
- ...

347
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:26,833
-Wake up !

348
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,167
-It's not good,
the good Lord will punish you.

349
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,125
- Here, here is the good Lord!

350
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,792
-
! You have to be careful, though.

351
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:38,500
- ...

352
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:41,375
-ONE, TWO, ONE, TWO, ONE, TWO.

353
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,500
- And hey there!
-Hop !

354
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:48,125
- ...

355
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:51,250
-Come on, let's finish the cabin.
We start with the roof.

356
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,292
Luigi, Lucas, go get...
-Where are you the boss?

357
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,792
-Well said. It's me.

358
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,875
-It's not
what I meant, Lucas.

359
00:20:59,042 --> 00:21:00,667
-He who hoists the flag,

360
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:03,625
it is he who decides.
-That's true !

361
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:06,625
-Pushes you !
-I never had it!

362
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:08,917
They argue.

363
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:10,708
I want to hoist it.

364
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,458
-Everyboy inside ! There's the witch!

365
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,458
Move over, big guy!

366
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,125
-I'm not fat.

367
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:20,792
-Let me, I want to see.

368
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,417
-Always on the prowl, the Louison.
With his potions,

369
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,208
she would poison the abbot.
-The abbot?

370
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,625
-He says it's the demon.

371
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:29,125
A maker of angels.

372
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,125
-Why does he not like her?
if she makes angels?

373
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:35,083
-
1 is wearing a dress
without knowing women.

374
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:37,750
-Where are they going ?

375
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:41,042
- They can't understand.

376
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,208
Magical music

377

378
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:47,875
She is so beautiful.

379
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,833
Cris

380
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,708

381
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,833
-Sir ? What is worth to us

382
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,708
honor?

383
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,875
-The region is being evacuated.

384
00:22:03,292 --> 00:22:06,250
The Teutons try
to take us from behind.

385
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:08,167
-More…
Explosion

386
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:09,750
- ...

387
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:13,625
- Leave everything.
This is an order with immediate effect.

388
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,833
Gather the kids, we'll escort you.

389
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Explosions in the distance

390
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:36,917
- Maybe it's a witch...

391
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,417
But it has the best fruit.

392
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:40,833
- Get the hell out of me!

393
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,792
Get out or I'll rip your guts out.
Your lice will cry.

394
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:45,625
- Do you have lice?

395
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,583
She really is a witch!
-Wait for me !

396
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,125
-Quickly ! Come on !

397
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:54,750
Detonations in the distance

398
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:57,458
Disturbing music

399
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:14,042

400
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:17,417
-Four children are missing.
Lucas ! Ludwig !

401
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,458
Have you seen four children?
-My father.

402
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,917
The Lulus are in the lead.

403
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,417
-Certain ? I will see.

404
00:23:24,167 --> 00:23:27,083
-Wait,
you sprained my ankle.

405
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:30,875
-Good, come… Let’s return to the Lord.

406
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:34,208
-Slower, you're hurting me.

407
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,500
"He tore, but he will heal.

408
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,958
"He knocked,
but he will bandage our wounds.”

409
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:45,000
Hosea. Chapter 6. Verse 1.

410
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:48,375
Come on.
-Slow down, father.

411
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,292
You hurt me.

412
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:54,792
Laughter

413
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:55,958

414
00:23:56,125 --> 00:23:57,667
-Attention !
Laughter

415
00:23:57,833 --> 00:23:59,625
-I'll get you!
-Stopped !

416
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:05,292
If the abbot sees us,
we're going to have some oats… To the dormitory!

417
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,667
-No way

418
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:10,417
to go to bed on an empty stomach.
-Do you ever think?

419
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,583
Imagine the punishment
if we get caught.

420
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,042
-We'll get caught
only if the gentleman complains.

421
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:17,750
- Sir try
to think for the group.

422
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:19,292
-Me too.

423
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:23,583
I think the band has fangs.
Let's vote. Who is hungry ?

424
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,500
I know where the abbot hides his reservations.

425
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:31,958
In the sacristy.

426
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,083
There is a trunk full of sausages,
crispy loaves of bread,

427
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,583
Strawberry jam…
-Strawberries ?

428
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,542
- Not to mention the Mass wine.

429
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:45,167
This evening, it's chef Luigi who's entertaining.

430
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,167
-Have you ever tasted sacramental wine?

431
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:50,958
-And not just once.
If you prefer to go to bed...

432
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:53,125
-Okay, but we'll be quick.

433
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,875
-It's not okay to drink it.

434
00:24:56,042 --> 00:24:58,708
-You believe that the sky
will fall on us?

435
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:01,542
Explosions

436
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:07,500
- ...-

437
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:12,000
-It's because of the Mass wine.
I told you.

438
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,167
No one ever listens to me.

439
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:16,958
Sinister music

440
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:19,750
- ...

441
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:21,667
They are all dead.

442
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,125
We're all alone.

443
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:26,708
-We are not alone, Lucas.
We are together.

444
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:31,375
Melancholic music

445
00:25:31,542 --> 00:25:33,792
- ...

446
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:36,333
The abbey is collapsing.

447
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,292
- ...

448
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,792
We'll go to the village when it's daylight.

449
00:25:41,958 --> 00:26:37,083
- ...

450
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:40,083
-Evacuation order?

451
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:45,958
The orphanage…

452
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:48,708
He was evacuated. And the village too.

453
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:50,500
It's marked there.

454
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:57,667
-So they're not dead.
-Why evacuated?

455
00:26:57,833 --> 00:27:00,000
Shattering and breaking of glass

456
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:06,125
Disturbing music

457

458
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:29,625
-They left everything behind.

459
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:33,208
Metallic crash

460
00:27:33,375 --> 00:27:34,125
-Jerk,

461
00:27:34,292 --> 00:27:37,125

-The cannibals won't get me.

462
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,542
-It does not exist.
-Yes, the proof!

463
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,042
-Ludwig ?

464
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,667
-In theory, yes.

465
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:48,000
In New Zealand. Show me.

466
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,583
- Return to the hut.

467
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:51,792
We should never have come.

468
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:55,125
-Why eat people?

469
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:57,167
The boss makes the best welsh.

470
00:27:57,958 --> 00:28:01,583
-Maybe they only like meat.
Very fat and very big.

471
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:03,542
-I'm strong!

472

-She says she lives in Brussels.

554
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:18,708
Her parents sent her
sheltered with his uncle in France.

555
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:21,500
The convoy was bombed.
She ran away.

556
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:23,125
-Bombed?

557
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:25,708
That's it, anything.

558
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:28,667
-What's in his suitcase?
- Chick stuff.

559
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:31,208
Doll, dinette, thimble.
She's cracked.

560
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:34,542
-Then why are you following me?

561
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:36,375
-Who are you ?

562
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:39,958
-It's not for the ladies
to introduce themselves first.

563
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,667
-To the ladies ?
You'd have to be one.

564
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:45,292
-You want me to prove it to you?
-It's good.

565
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:47,583
We believe you.
Sigh

566
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:51,958
-My papers.

567
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:55,042
-Ah.

568
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,375
Here is Lucian. Luigi.

569
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:01,625
Lucas and I are Ludwig.
Together, we are the Lulus.

570
00:33:01,792 --> 00:33:03,833
-I'm Luce.
It makes me a Lulu.

571
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
-Non.

572
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:08,625
In theory, no.
-Because… ?

573
00:33:08,792 --> 00:33:11,042
-Because you are… well…

574
00:33:11,208 --> 00:33:12,875
You see…
-Voilà.

575
00:33:13,042 --> 00:33:14,875
- Well yes, we are a band of…

576
00:33:15,042 --> 00:33:16,667
-No, no.

577
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,833
You have parents. We are orphans.

578
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,292
-Voilà.

579
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:22,750
-Where do you see my parents?

580
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:26,792
-Nowhere.
-Nowhere.

581
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:30,208
Until further notice, I will be a Lulu.
What way ?

582
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:32,708
-To be.

583
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:34,625
-Merci.

584
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:38,875
You come ?

585
00:33:39,292 --> 00:33:40,750
- Yes, we are coming.

586
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:42,958
Luigi breathes.

587
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:52,250
-Is that your headquarters?

588
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:54,542
The Germans
just have to behave.

589
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:58,292
- You stay here. We need to talk
between men. I have a plan.

590
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,167
-The war,
It's not a girl's thing.

591
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,417
You understood ?

592
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,000
What's the matter ?

593
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,000
Oh, wait for me!
-What's your plan?

594
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:12,917
-My plan ?

595
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,125
-No one listens to me.

596
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:16,958
-No more having a girl around.
-Excellent plan.

597
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:20,292
-Quite simply.
- We talk in the cabin.

598
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,833
-Yes, excellent.

599
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:24,083
-No need for a girl.
-It's true.

600
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:28,167
-She will never follow us.
She doesn't have the skills.

601
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,917
-It's certain.
-A girl means problems.

602
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:34,542
-Always whining.
-His dresses will get us noticed.

603
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,292
She has no place here.

604
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:37,833
She'll never have it.

605
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,417
Chantone light.

606
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:45,042
- ...

607
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,833
Lucien, Luigi and Ludwig
continue to debate.

608
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,583
Imagine if the Germans are coming.
She's going to scream.

609
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,708
-It's risky.

610
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:54,500
We have to get rid of it.
-I have an idea.

611
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:56,750
Let's put a spider
in her hair.

612
00:34:57,417 --> 00:34:59,875
-Serious ?
- Girls are afraid of spiders.

613
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:02,125
-Do you smell that smell?

614
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:04,292
Happy music

615
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:09,292
- ...

616
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,458
-Oh !

617
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:28,292
- ...

618
00:35:28,458 --> 00:35:29,792
-Watch out !

619
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:41,042
- ...

620
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:42,750
-I choked!

621
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:45,333
- ...

622
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:51,375
-War is not a girl’s thing.
All right.

623
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:54,958
It's also not
a boy thing. It is…

624
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:56,792
An adult thing.

625
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:59,000
- So we don't care.

626
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:01,792
-Here, we are relaxed.

627
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:05,167
-Not long. You have to get organized.

628
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:09,500
Let's find where to go.
Or sleep. What to eat.

629
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:12,875
-I have an incredible idea.

630
00:36:13,042 --> 00:36:16,833
Do you know how to do the splits?
- But… it's serious.

631
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,542
The Germans are everywhere in the village.
Maybe even in France.

632
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:21,833
-So we wait

633
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,875
that the army repels the invader?

634
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,875
-Do you have a better solution?

635
00:36:26,042 --> 00:36:28,042
-Become German?
-And the wheel?

636
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,250
I adore. Look.

637
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:32,417
Light music

638
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,542
- ...

639
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:35,583
-Lucas, stay here.

640
00:36:36,917 --> 00:36:38,917
Okay, what was I saying?

641
00:36:39,375 --> 00:36:42,542
I said that the army...

642
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:46,500
Luce, you can stop
to do anything?

643
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:48,458
♪ was talking.

644
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:51,292
-Do you think the water is cold?

645
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:54,625
-Luce, let’s try
to find solutions.

646
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:58,542
-Too bad, I would have given a kiss
to the first able to jump.

647
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:01,958
-It's dangerous, isn't it?
-Jump or kiss me?

648
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:03,292
-In theory, both.

649
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,708
Kiss you
can transmit diseases.

650
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:08,667
Jump after eating
can cause hydrolution.

651
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,958
If you agree
let us think...

652
00:37:11,708 --> 00:37:14,625
♪ have the solution.
-What is your solution?

653
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,208
-Go to Switzerland.

654
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:19,750
There's no war there. And there is…
- What is it?

655
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:23,458
What else is there in Switzerland?
- There's... chocolate.

656
00:37:25,167 --> 00:37:27,083
And a naked girl.

657
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,375
Cry of joy

658
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,167
Can't swim, girls?

659
00:37:38,333 --> 00:37:40,125
-We have to save her.
-Help !

660
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,083
Help ! Help !

661
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:47,042
Cris

-Oh, wait for me!

663
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,875
-Luce !

664
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:58,542
-I got you!

665
00:37:58,708 --> 00:38:00,708
Happy music

666
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:06,375
- ...

667
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:07,625
-Like that !

668
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:12,500
- ...

669
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:14,458
Thunder

670
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:19,667
-It will rain.
- Who cares, we're wet.

671
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:30,583
- ...

672
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:47,875
-What are you waiting for, the residues
miscarriage? An invitation ?

673
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,417
Drink. It's soup
not arsenic.

674
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:03,417
-Thank you Madam.
-You give me some madam, now?

675
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:07,042
Like the villagers
who need my drinks

676
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:09,042
and spit on me in public.

677
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:12,708
Phew. I do not care,
they can say whatever they want.

678
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,042
Go out !

679
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,625
It should suit you.

680
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:21,833
It has to be useful,
there are no more kids here.

681
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,542
Go change there.
-Did you have children?

682
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:28,875
-Only one.

683
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:30,708
About his size.

684
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:32,917
He is at war. I'm waiting for him.

685
00:39:33,083 --> 00:39:34,958
-That's why
that you didn't leave.

686
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:39,667
-Here, the dress in which

687
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:41,542
my husband took me dancing.

688
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:45,750
Go to the bedroom too.
And you, come on!

689
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:48,333
Put it all on me.
We're not at the Ritz.

690
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,208
And pas de cabine.
Your bistouquettes don't interest me.

691
00:39:51,375 --> 00:39:53,875
Thunder
Lucas groaned.

692
00:39:55,417 --> 00:39:56,917
What do you want ?

693
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,792
-Your husband too,
Was he a wizard?

694
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:03,167
-Of course.

695
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:04,750
A real.

696
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,250
We lived in a house
in gingerbread.

697
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:09,125
-And where is he?

698
00:40:09,542 --> 00:40:10,833
-My husband ?

699
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,708
You just finished it.

700
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,417
See, this broom?

701
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,083
It was his.

702
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:25,958
-A balai volant?

703
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,917
-No, a broom that sweeps.

704
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:30,542
It is your turn. Go to work.

705
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:33,042
I'm not going
accommodation and food to the eye.

706
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:36,542
-Do you want us to stay?

707
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,833
-A night ! Afterwards, leave!

708
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,083
Out of my sight, the abandoned packages.

709
00:40:43,792 --> 00:40:45,625
-How long does it last,
a war ?

710
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:48,083
-It lasts too long.

711
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:51,500
Soon there will be more than that,
orphans.

712
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:54,292
-What do you call
a childless parent?

713
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,000
-We don't call him.

714
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,917
We let him cry
in his corner.

715
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:04,583
-And your son?

716
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:07,750
What is his name ?

717
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:10,958
Someone is coming down the stairs.

718
00:41:11,125 --> 00:41:13,583
Soft music

719
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:16,833
-Anselm.

720
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:23,250
-You told him stories,
to your Hansel? You know,

721
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:25,167
bedtime stories?

722
00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:26,792
-Of course.

723
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:29,542
Loads of stories.

724
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:37,583
Terrible stories.

725
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,833
With murders and demons.

726
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,375
-Go ahead, please.

727
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:49,667
-In a village, there lived a woman.

728
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:51,458
Very bad.

729
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:55,500
And very cruel. A day…
Thunder

730
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:58,667
she sees 5 disgusting pigs
who prick his raspberries.

731
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:01,333
So she gives them soup.

732
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,208
Poisoned soup.

733
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:05,083
when they sleep,

734
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:08,042
she cuts them into slices
like sausage.

735
00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:10,292
It is what I am going to do.

736
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:12,708
Hum…

737
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:14,125
I will feast.

738
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:16,333
That's it, end of story.

739
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,542
-It's the most beautiful story
that anyone has ever told me.

740
00:42:19,708 --> 00:42:22,375
Soft music

741
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:25,208
-We didn't have to
tell you a lot, my little one.

742
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:27,500
- ...

743
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:29,583
Thunder

744
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:38,167
- ...

745
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:39,750
Cracking of wood

746
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,125
-Hop.

747
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:45,542
I think we have enough wood
for winter.

748
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:50,917
-My father says that the wood is hot
four times. When we pick it up,

749
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:55,458
when we cut it,
when you put it away, and...

750
00:42:57,792 --> 00:42:59,375
And a little when you burn it.

751
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:09,958
-Stopped. Stop smiling.

752
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:12,250
If you want a chance, stop.

753
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:14,917
At that age, girls like
bad boys.

754
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:16,917
-What are you talking about ?

755
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:20,125
-How silly you look when you look at her.
-Silly?

756
00:43:20,292 --> 00:43:25,042
-It's later that girls love
the good ones. Look mysterious.

757
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:29,667
- Dark?
-Yes. Try to see?

758
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
-Mysterious. Like that ?

759
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:34,208
-Yeah, it's not bad.

760
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:36,208
Keep this. Keep it.

761
00:43:36,917 --> 00:43:38,083
-Mysterious.

762
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,208
Louison coughs.

763
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:57,500
Soft music

764
00:43:57,667 --> 00:44:03,708
- ...

765
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,417
-What's wrong with him?

766
00:44:06,542 --> 00:44:07,625
-We are back.

767
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:10,167
-Look at the children,
the beautiful apples.

768
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:14,000
-Lucas, can't you come help us?

769
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:15,708
-I'm not here !

770
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:19,458
-Looks like I found myself
my red armbands.

771
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:20,833
-It's what ?

772
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,417
-The Boches,
as soon as they find a kid,

773
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:26,333
they put a red armband on him
and at work.

774
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:28,833
-Witches do the same thing.

775
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,583
-And mothers too?

776
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:43,125
How about making a pie?
-OUI !

777
00:44:43,292 --> 00:44:45,958
-Go peel them, I'm coming.
-Come.

778
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,250
Who prepares the dough?
-TOI.

779
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:54,708
-This wood is hard to split.

780
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,667
It's a bit like the heart.

781
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:00,625
The harder you hit it, the harder it gets.

782
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,417
While sometimes...

783
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:07,667
Just take it
from the good side.

784
00:45:13,542 --> 00:45:15,708
-Louison. Someone there.

785
00:45:22,083 --> 00:45:23,708
-Those damn Boches…

786
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:25,333
They won't leave the village

787
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,625
without their deserter.

788
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:28,875
They look like French officers, right?

789
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:31,708
Let's take no risk.
Go hide, my children.

790
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:36,792
Soft music

791
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:43,625
- ...

792
00:45:43,792 --> 00:45:46,167
Disturbing music

793
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:53,500
- ...

794
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,375
-Louison Roussel?

795
00:45:55,542 --> 00:45:58,333
I regret to announce
the death of your son,

796
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,083
died for the fatherland.

797
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,417
Please accept condolences…

798
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:05,667
dark music

799
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:09,792
- ...

800
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:49,083
Melancholic music

801
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:57,417
- ...

802
00:46:57,583 --> 00:46:59,875
-You're in luck
to be orphans.

803
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:02,333
You have nothing more to lose.

804
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:07,375
I have to find Anselme.

805
00:47:08,917 --> 00:47:10,458
My little Anselm…

806
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:14,083
He is waiting for me.

807
00:47:19,333 --> 00:47:20,750
He is waiting for me.

808
00:47:20,917 --> 00:47:39,208
- ...

809
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:41,792
-How are we going to do without a mother?

810
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:44,708
-Like we've always done.

811
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:46,417
We don't care about adults.

812
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:49,708
They know that hitting each other
and abandon their kids.

813
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:52,583
- They know how to make pies.
- And hugs.

814
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,417
-And smiles.

815
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:57,042
-Guys, we have to go to Switzerland.

816
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,667
There they have wooden cabins.

817
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:01,542
Cabins, they call it.

818
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:05,292
Guys !

819
00:48:05,792 --> 00:48:07,042
Wait !

820
00:48:21,375 --> 00:48:25,458
-Oh oh ! Someone there
in our cabin. I was sure of it.

821
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:28,042
No one ever listens to me.

822
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,292
-You who always want to go ahead,
You're welcome.

823
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:37,458
-On. I'm the strongest one.

824
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,542
Disturbing music

825
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:48,917
- ...

826
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:50,750
Are you guys following me?

827
00:48:51,167 --> 00:48:52,292
Hein ?

828
00:48:52,458 --> 00:49:05,208
- ...

829
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:08,000
Someone is whistling in the cabin.

830
00:49:08,167 --> 00:49:19,875
- ...

831
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:24,083
Do not move.

832
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:27,500
Words in German
It's a Boche!

833
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:30,250
It's a Boche, guys!

834
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:32,458
What do I do ?
-

 will denounce us.

835
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:34,625
-Kill him.
-I can't shoot.

836
00:49:34,792 --> 00:49:35,875
Do not move.

837
00:49:36,042 --> 00:49:38,083
-Luigi !
-We are friends.

838
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,083
-What does it mean ?

839
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:41,000
-Friends.
-What does it mean ?

840
00:49:41,167 --> 00:49:42,667
-I don't know!
- Luigi, tire!

841
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:44,292
-I can not !

842
00:49:44,458 --> 00:49:45,083
-Come on !

843
00:49:52,667 --> 00:49:53,667
-I did what ?

844
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:56,375
♪ did what? I killed him ?

845
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:03,917
-"Friends" means "ami".

846
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:07,250
We are “Americans”.

847
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:17,125
No “guerre”.

848
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:21,292
““Amis”. We are “Amis”.

849
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:25,167
Amis.

850
00:50:29,958 --> 00:50:30,750
Essen…

851
00:50:31,292 --> 00:50:33,542
Soft music

852
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:46,375
- ...

853
00:50:46,542 --> 00:50:48,625
(-What if it's human meat?)

854
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:52,083
-Well seasoned,
I wouldn't feel the difference.

855
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,292
-He's the deserter.

856
00:50:59,125 --> 00:51:00,958
-He! comes from the desert?
-Non.

857
00:51:01,875 --> 00:51:05,375
He fled the army.
If he gets caught, he's dead.

858
00:51:06,292 --> 00:51:07,708
-Like us.

859
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:10,542
- You read a lot of books.

860
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:11,833
Do you know German?

861
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,875
-A sentence or two. In theory…
-Stopped.

862
00:51:15,042 --> 00:51:16,958
Go to practice. Come on.

863
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:18,542
You go-y.

864
00:51:21,292 --> 00:51:22,375
-I…

865
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:26,333
I think my pig is whistling.

866
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:29,875
The German laughs.

867
00:51:30,042 --> 00:51:33,708
- ...

868
00:51:33,875 --> 00:51:35,542
-I think my pig is whistling.

869
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:37,042
That's good.

870
00:51:37,208 --> 00:51:39,458
Laughter

871
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:41,625
-What did you say ?
-I don't know.

872
00:51:41,792 --> 00:51:44,500
I read it.
It means: "I believe

873
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:45,708
“let my pig hiss.”

874
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:46,875
Laughter

875
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,750
-My name is Hans!

876
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:54,542
-Ludwig.

877
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:58,083
-Ah, Ludwig !

878
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:01,708
He sings the Hymn to Joy.

879
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:04,458
- ...

880
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:06,625
-He would have done better
to stay at home.

881
00:52:06,792 --> 00:52:10,625
-Hans.…. I.…. my wife

882
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:13,167
Woman. Germany.

883
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:15,042
- Oh, yes!

884
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:19,250
He has a wife in Germany.
He deserted to find her.

885
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:21,750
-She is fat, his wife.

886
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:23,958
- By dint of eating sausages.

887
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:27,125
-No. No. Not "big".

888
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:28,708
Pregnant.

889
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:34,708
Pregnant.

890
00:52:34,875 --> 00:52:36,833
- She eats children too?

891
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,708
-But no, she's pregnant.

892
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:40,708
-What are we going to do with him?

893
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:42,417
- He won't stay long.

894
00:52:42,875 --> 00:52:45,917
He is going to find his wife
before the baby is born.

895
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:48,583
Ah, that's so romantic.

896
00:52:51,917 --> 00:52:52,625
Quoi ?

897
00:52:52,792 --> 00:52:55,792
Luigi mutters.

898
00:52:56,250 --> 00:53:01,583
-It smells good.
Rabbit stew, it smells good.

899
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,542
-You still talk in your sleep.

900
00:53:10,125 --> 00:53:12,250
-It smells of rabbit stew.

901
00:53:15,333 --> 00:53:17,000
It smells of rabbit stew!

902
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:19,917
-Good morning.

903
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:25,542
Regulation

904
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:27,250
-Lucas, I can play the owl!

905
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:30,500
-We're going to get along well with Hans.

906
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:34,042
- Didn't you notice?
He wears a German uniform.

907
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,292
-It suits him so well.

908
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,208
- "It suits him so well."

909
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:42,083
“He’s so romantic…”

910
00:53:43,917 --> 00:53:46,000
Maybe he tries
to poison us.

911
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,375
Ludwig imitates the owl.

912
00:53:49,542 --> 00:53:50,750
-Bon appetit.
-Merci.

913
00:53:51,167 --> 00:53:53,917
Ludwig imitates the owl.

914
00:53:55,042 --> 00:53:58,583
- ...

915
00:54:00,292 --> 00:54:01,375
-Hans ?

916
00:54:01,792 --> 00:54:04,917
Fire.

It falls on me everywhere.

1289
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:52,458
Little laugh

1290
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:56,167
-They have never seen...
- As black as your white ass.

1291
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:59,375
When I found it,
his blood flowed red.

1292
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:02,417
-It's Gaston. He's a bit... boorish.

1293
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:04,458
I'm Moussa.

1294
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:05,542
-It's not a name.

1295
01:18:05,708 --> 01:18:08,917
-No, it's a title.
Title of the emperor of the savannah.

1296
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:12,000
Lightning Warrior,
slayer of elephants.

1297
01:18:12,917 --> 01:18:15,750
- Did you slay elephants?
-Yes. You came across some

1298
01:18:15,917 --> 01:18:17,167
in the forest ?

1299
01:18:19,417 --> 01:18:21,792
No, they're all afraid of me.

1300
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:25,042
He trumpets then sneers.

1301
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:27,333
It's big, but it's all scary.

1302
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,458
Soft music

1303
01:18:30,625 --> 01:18:45,250
- ...

1304
01:18:47,125 --> 01:18:48,792
-We coax them from the belly.

1305
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:51,458
I will teach you to cook
lard beans.

1306
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:53,292
Not a woman resists it.

1307
01:18:54,917 --> 01:18:56,667
You will thank me later.

1308
01:18:57,167 --> 01:18:59,000
-The village chief offered me

1309
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:00,375
to the French army.

1310
01:19:01,042 --> 01:19:02,500
He didn't want me to marry

1311
01:19:02,667 --> 01:19:05,750
her daughter. It took a brave
to wage war.

1312
01:19:05,917 --> 01:19:07,958
I was thinking of a fight

1313
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:10,042
with the tribe next door. I said yes.

1314
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:14,250
They put me in a truck.
Then another. Then in a boat.

1315
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:17,542
Days and days of travel.

1316
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:19,667
Afterwards, the rain, the cold…

1317
01:19:19,833 --> 01:19:21,083
France.

1318
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:24,500
-Have you never heard of it?
-You heard about

1319
01:19:24,667 --> 01:19:25,625
from Kolda?

1320
01:19:25,792 --> 01:19:26,833
-I know.

1321
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:27,875
-In Senegal.

1322
01:19:29,458 --> 01:19:30,708
-Non.

1323
01:19:31,292 --> 01:19:32,875
-He's funny.

1324
01:19:33,042 --> 01:19:34,875
- Here, child. Give me that.

1325
01:19:35,042 --> 01:19:36,042
It must be your size.

1326
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:41,833
-Hooves ?
♪ I don't have the money to pay them.

1327
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:44,042
-I think it's a gift.

1328
01:19:44,208 --> 01:19:47,250
-A gift ? I don't give gifts.
It's my job.

1329
01:19:47,417 --> 01:19:51,333
-Do you know Switzerland?
-No, but I know how to get there.

1330
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:54,833
A foundry uses
its own railway line.

1331
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,458
They have trains that go to Switzerland.

1332
01:19:57,625 --> 01:19:59,875
Well, it's… over there.

1333
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:02,958
About a day's walk. In the city.

1334
01:20:03,125 --> 01:20:04,500
-Which town ?
-Guise.

1335
01:20:04,667 --> 01:20:08,333
- There you go, Guise.
-Yes. The town is full of Boches.

1336
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:11,250
Damn criminals, those.
-Not all.

1337
01:20:11,417 --> 01:20:12,792
Hans, he was nice.

1338
01:20:12,958 --> 01:20:15,750
-Where is your nice curly hair?
He left you?

1339
01:20:15,917 --> 01:20:17,167
-No, he is dead!

1340
01:20:17,542 --> 01:20:19,292
-Oh one less.

1341
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:21,917
-You are fat,

1342
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,375
old and nasty!

1343
01:20:24,542 --> 01:20:28,167
-If the soup is not good enough,
Get away with your gang!

1344
01:20:28,333 --> 01:20:30,542
There's no shortage of orphans.

1345
01:20:30,708 --> 01:20:31,417
-Gaston !

1346
01:20:31,917 --> 01:20:32,583
-Quoi ?

1347
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:35,708
- They are children. -Good…

1348
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Well... since you didn't have parents,

1349
01:20:41,167 --> 01:20:44,458
no education...
I accept your apology.

1350
01:20:45,042 --> 01:20:48,083
- You're not that fat.
You are old in your head.

1351
01:20:48,542 --> 01:20:49,583
-Yeah…

1352
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,417
- Say sorry, it will be fine.

1353
01:20:51,792 --> 01:20:54,250
-Eh ? I did not completely understand.

1354
01:20:54,417 --> 01:20:55,667
- Are you deaf?

1355
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:57,208
-Oh, a little respect!

1356
01:20:57,375 --> 01:20:58,792
-When you say a kind word.

1357
01:20:58,958 --> 01:21:00,083
-Bah…

1358
01:21:01,333 --> 01:21:02,000
-Bah !

1359
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:03,667
Cry of frustration

1360
01:21:04,167 --> 01:21:05,208
-It is very good.

1361
01:21:05,375 --> 01:21:07,375
Well sent.
Don't give in.

1362
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:13,958
Soft music

1363
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:20,542
- ...

1364
01:21:20,708 --> 01:21:23,083
they won't arrive
to go to town alone.

1365
01:21:25,292 --> 01:21:27,167
-You did well.
They are five.

1366
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:30,333
- They are children.

1367
01:21:32,333 --> 01:21:33,458
I will guide them.

1368
01:21:35,042 --> 01:21:39,625
I didn't escape from my camp
of prisoners to freeze to death here.

1369
01:21:41,333 --> 01:21:44,250
And I took too much advantage of your inhospitality.

1370
01:21:46,125 --> 01:21:47,417
-So much the better.

1371
01:21:47,917 --> 01:21:49,625
I prefer to live alone.

1372
01:21:49,792 --> 01:21:53,500
-In my village, we say
that when someone saves your life,

1373
01:21:53,667 --> 01:21:55,708
you have to save his life in return.

1374
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:01,042
-I'm the one who saved your life.
Not them.

1375
01:22:02,167 --> 01:22:04,542
-In my opinion,
Toubabs are all the same.

1376
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:06,833
Little snowmen.

1377
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:09,833
-Who am I going to yell at?

1378
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,208
-I'm going to miss you too.

1380
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:24,833
-Luce. Lucian. There are gifts.

1381

Quickly, Luce! Lucien, wake up.

01:22:27,583 --> 01:22:29,333
Look.
-Quoi ?

1383
01:22:29,708 --> 01:22:31,250
“There are treats.

-Wow!

Look at !
- You and I are a soldier.

1387
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:39,292
Look at.

1388
01:22:39,875 --> 01:22:41,458
♪ got a deer.

1389
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:43,750
-Wow! are they our size?

1390
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,125
-Did you see ? There are our names.

1391
01:22:46,292 --> 01:22:49,042
-I love foxes.
They are so beautiful.

1392

1395
01:22:58,167 --> 01:22:59,125
-Why did he do that ?

What would I bother with?

Hein ?

1405
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:29,375
Where do you want me to put it?
In my pockets? My jacket ?

1406
01:23:31,167 --> 01:23:33,042
What ? What I ?

1407
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:35,458
-I don't understand.
Translator, quick!

- Quoi? Translator?

1409
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:38,333
No need for a translator

01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,625
to understand
what an asshole you are!

1411
01:23:40,792 --> 01:23:42,833
Easy to understand :
leave me alone.

-He! wants to search the trailer.

-Again ? Your stupid sergeant
annoys me every week.

You go-y. Vas-y, on va se marrer.
No, come on!

There's more than just me. Are you proud?

Hey, oh, calm down!

No, it's fine!

They ran that way!

1443
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,583
They went that way.

1444

Gaston. Everyone we love,
misfortune befalls them!

1458
01:26:26,083 --> 01:26:29,208
We can't be loved.
We're just bad luck.

1459
01:26:29,917 --> 01:26:32,208
Even our mothers couldn't.

1460
01:26:34,833 --> 01:26:37,958
-If. A mother loves her children.

1461
01:26:38,125 --> 01:26:39,375
-And you know what?

1462
01:26:39,542 --> 01:26:41,000
- I know, that's all.

1463
01:26:41,167 --> 01:26:43,833
-one more thing
what you read in your books.

1464
01:26:47,833 --> 01:26:48,833
-One.

1465
01:26:52,125 --> 01:26:54,458
I'll take you to town, okay?

1466
01:26:54,875 --> 01:26:57,458
We're going to mingle with the workers.

1467
01:26:57,625 --> 01:27:01,042
And presto, direction the train
for Switzerland.

1468
01:27:06,542 --> 01:27:09,250
Train whistle

1469
01:27:11,583 --> 01:27:13,417
-I have never seen so many houses.

1470
01:27:14,292 --> 01:27:16,708
-Do you believe that Paris,
is it that big?

1471
01:27:16,875 --> 01:27:18,833
-I saw there
the tallest tower in the world.

1472
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,500
Hell. It even went beyond the clouds.

1473
01:27:21,667 --> 01:27:25,083
-What is it used for?
- To measure the pride of the French.

1474
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:27,667
He's laughing.
Come on, it’s this way.

1475
01:27:27,833 --> 01:27:31,333
Soft music

1476
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:41,292
- ...

1477
01:27:41,458 --> 01:27:43,250
Welcome to Guise.

1478
01:27:45,667 --> 01:27:48,333
Stay there, I'll look
the doctor, okay?

1479
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:53,458
- ...

1480
01:27:53,625 --> 01:27:55,625
Dr Berrault.
-Oh, Moussa !

1481
01:27:56,625 --> 01:27:58,667
-Happy to see you.
-And I therefore.

1482
01:27:58,833 --> 01:28:02,333
- ...

1483
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,875
-We walked a long way to come.

1484
01:28:05,042 --> 01:28:06,708
-You come from far away.

1485
01:28:07,375 --> 01:28:09,458
-Let me introduce you to Dr. Berrault.

1486
01:28:10,375 --> 01:28:12,458
-Hello miss. Sir.

1487
01:28:13,333 --> 01:28:14,125
-Bonjour.

1488
01:28:14,292 --> 01:28:16,042
-Ÿ has female doctors?

1489
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:19,292
- We are in 1914.
You're 100 years late.

1490
01:28:19,792 --> 01:28:21,500
Hello, doctor.

1491
01:28:21,667 --> 01:28:23,375
- No doctor. It's Constance.

1492
01:28:24,833 --> 01:28:25,917
Show me this wound.

1493
01:28:26,458 --> 01:28:28,208
-No, that's nothing.

1494
01:28:28,375 --> 01:28:30,750
It's Leprechaun. He lost an eye.

1495
01:28:30,917 --> 01:28:33,917
-Oh I see.
But I have a whole jar of it.

1496
01:28:34,333 --> 01:28:35,083
-Madame…

1497
01:28:36,375 --> 01:28:38,833
Do you treat Germans?
-Everyone.

1498
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:40,417
-Enemies.

1499
01:28:40,583 --> 01:28:42,500
-Yes. Pain has no boundaries.

1500
01:28:45,083 --> 01:28:46,000
Bon…

1501
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:49,250
We will put you up on the top floor.

1502
01:28:49,417 --> 01:28:52,542
We have room
since the men were on the front.

1503
01:28:53,833 --> 01:28:56,375
And I'm going to reserve five rooms for you.

1504
01:28:56,542 --> 01:28:59,000
With a sequel for Moussa.
- Thank you, doctor.

1505
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,333
- Will we each have a room?

1506
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,833
-It is a problem ?
-No, it's the opposite.

1507
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,583
That's wonderful.
We're not used to it.

1508
01:29:09,042 --> 01:29:11,375
-Madam, we thank you, but…

1509
01:29:11,542 --> 01:29:14,500
We're not going to stay.
We have to leave for Switzerland.

1510
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:19,208
-Swiss or not,
you have to smell clean.

1511
01:29:19,375 --> 01:29:21,250
- We are clean.
It rained this morning.

1512
01:29:21,417 --> 01:29:25,375
-If there is no bath,
no theater and no swimming pool.

1513
01:29:25,542 --> 01:29:27,708
-A theater, a swimming pool
and what else?

1514
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:32,500
-School, park, nursery, vegetable garden,
games room, library.

1515
01:29:32,667 --> 01:29:34,583
Shops, archery…

1516
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:37,333
And our own station
with a train to Switzerland.

1517
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,792
He leaves tomorrow morning.
-Tomorrow morning !

1518
01:29:39,958 --> 01:29:41,417
-Welcome to the familistery.

1519
01:29:41,583 --> 01:29:42,667
Unique social utopia.

1520
01:29:44,833 --> 01:29:45,917
-A social utopia?

1521
01:29:46,083 --> 01:29:47,958
-It's a world that doesn't exist.

1522
01:29:48,125 --> 01:29:49,750
-That's what I said.

1523
01:29:49,917 --> 01:29:52,500
-The factory and the station too,
is it the "famiphistery"?

1524
01:29:52,667 --> 01:29:54,333
Laughter

1525
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:56,875
-Absolutely. The familiarity.

1526
01:29:57,042 --> 01:29:58,292
-The People's Palace.

1527
01:29:58,458 --> 01:30:00,542
Built
like the Palace of Versailles.

1528
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:03,500
-So there is a king? And you…

1529
01:30:04,542 --> 01:30:05,750
You are the boss.

1530
01:30:08,333 --> 01:30:09,667
- You have had fleas before.

1531
01:30:11,333 --> 01:30:12,542
Fleas drink the…

1532
01:30:12,708 --> 01:30:13,542
- You don't know.

1533
01:30:13,708 --> 01:30:16,375
-Yes. And the bosses are…

1534
01:30:16,542 --> 01:30:17,292
-Petit ?

1535
01:30:17,458 --> 01:30:20,542
-It's the same.
So the fleas, the bosses,

1536
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:22,292
dirty children… oh!

1537
01:30:23,708 --> 01:30:26,708
Oops ! Out.
What do you decide?

1538
01:30:28,875 --> 01:30:29,792
- On see low.

1539
01:30:29,958 --> 01:30:31,625
Laughter
-You have to scrub well.

1540
01:30:31,792 --> 01:30:33,208
Upbeat music

1541
01:30:33,375 --> 01:30:37,500
- ...

1542
01:30:38,042 --> 01:30:39,208
-I do not understand anymore.

1543
01:30:39,375 --> 01:30:41,833
You shouldn't smile.
Must write poems.

1544
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,417
Gotta cook lard beans.

1545
01:30:45,458 --> 01:30:48,792
What do you do to seduce a girl?
-I hunt the lion.

1546
01:30:48,958 --> 01:30:51,083
I bring back his mane.

1547
01:30:51,250 --> 01:30:52,917
-The mane ?

1548
01:30:53,792 --> 01:30:55,667
-And you have nothing more European?

1549
01:30:56,083 --> 01:30:57,667
- Well, you...

1550
01:30:58,042 --> 01:31:01,042
Yes, in Paris, I saw something.

1551
01:31:01,208 --> 01:31:03,917
The women,
they love to dance java.

1552
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:07,250
It's radical. Dance the java,
you catch the girl.

1553
01:31:07,417 --> 01:31:08,667
-On ?
-Hum.

1554
01:31:08,833 --> 01:31:11,000
Yes. You take her by the waist.

1555
01:31:11,167 --> 01:31:13,458
You hold her against you. Hmm?

1556
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:15,333
And you turn.

1557
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:18,458
You look her in the eye
and you turn.

1558
01:31:18,625 --> 01:31:20,458
You turn.
-After that ?

1559
01:31:20,625 --> 01:31:22,583
-When you feel that it is very ripe,

1560
01:31:22,750 --> 01:31:25,375
that she is under your spell,

1561
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:29,125
you… well, you tell him something.

1562
01:31:29,292 --> 01:31:30,667
(-I love you.)

1563
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:32,292
-Non.

1564
01:31:33,417 --> 01:31:35,958
But you can ask him
if she loves you.

1565
01:31:36,125 --> 01:31:38,750
-If she loves me?
- It's you, man.

1566
01:31:39,667 --> 01:31:42,000
-That's a bit pretentious.

1567
01:31:42,167 --> 01:31:44,792
If you want to give flowers,
it is your problem.

1568
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:48,042
He speaks in Wolof.
Your head is not okay.

1569
01:31:55,833 --> 01:31:59,167
We must wait for the right moment.
She's sending you the signal.

1570
01:31:59,333 --> 01:32:01,000
Too early is too late.

1571
01:32:06,083 --> 01:32:07,292
(Calm.)

1572
01:32:15,042 --> 01:32:16,917
-Wow, it’s beautiful.

1573
01:32:18,083 --> 01:32:19,625
-Amazing.

1574
01:32:20,083 --> 01:32:21,833
-This way. They are waiting for you.

1575
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:24,333
Do you like the dress?

1576
01:32:24,917 --> 01:32:26,583
We took it back to your measurements.

1577
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:29,292
-She is magnificent.

1578
01:32:29,458 --> 01:32:31,167
She was your daughter?

1579
01:32:31,333 --> 01:32:33,333
-I couldn't have children.

1580
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:36,292
Go join your friends.
The show is about to begin.

1581
01:32:36,458 --> 01:32:37,708
-The show ?

1582
01:32:37,875 --> 01:32:39,208
-It was scheduled for tomorrow,

1583
01:32:39,375 --> 01:32:42,458
but I asked the troop
kindly

1584
01:32:42,625 --> 01:32:44,750
provide you with representation.

1585
01:32:44,917 --> 01:32:47,250
Soft music

1586
01:32:47,417 --> 01:32:57,417
- ...

1587
01:32:58,125 --> 01:32:59,333
-It's a java.

1588
01:32:59,958 --> 01:33:01,458
-I had noticed.

1589
01:33:01,917 --> 01:33:03,000
-Do you like it?

1590
01:33:04,833 --> 01:33:06,417
-Would you like to stop?

1591
01:33:07,125 --> 01:33:09,583
Would you like to stop?
-Pardon…

1592
01:33:12,875 --> 01:33:15,167
i can make you
lard beans.

1593
01:33:16,917 --> 01:33:19,167
-Ÿ has something simpler.

1594
01:33:21,125 --> 01:33:22,250
-Like what ?

1595
01:33:22,417 --> 01:33:29,042
- ...

1596
01:33:29,208 --> 01:33:30,292
-Like that.

1597
01:33:30,458 --> 01:33:38,750
- ...

1598
01:33:38,917 --> 01:33:40,917
The music intensifies.

1599
01:33:41,083 --> 01:33:45,458
- ...

1600
01:33:45,625 --> 01:33:47,417
They sing.

1601
01:33:47,583 --> 01:33:49,708
Enchanting music

1602
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:59,292
- ...

1603
01:34:00,042 --> 01:34:00,958
-Bravo !

1604
01:34:01,125 --> 01:34:07,792
- ...

1605
01:34:07,958 --> 01:34:09,792
-I loved !
-Gorgeous.

1606
01:34:12,917 --> 01:34:14,208
Cheers

1607
01:34:15,458 --> 01:34:16,875
-So, did you like it?

1608
01:34:17,042 --> 01:34:18,375
-Fantastic.

1609
01:34:18,542 --> 01:34:20,833
-Amazing.
They all speak at the same time.

1610
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,458
- ...

1611
01:34:23,625 --> 01:34:27,458
-I take that as a yes.
We're going to celebrate with chocolate.

1612
01:34:27,625 --> 01:34:29,000
-Oui ?
-Madame Constance.

1613
01:34:29,792 --> 01:34:30,750
-I would like

1614
01:34:30,917 --> 01:34:32,708
ask you something.
I have not yet

1615
01:34:32,875 --> 01:34:34,375
talked to others, but...

1616
01:34:35,417 --> 01:34:37,375
I already know their answer.

1617
01:34:38,792 --> 01:34:43,125
It's hard to ask,
seeing as there are many of us and orphans.

1618
01:34:43,625 --> 01:34:45,625
-I'm listening to you.

1619
01:34:46,875 --> 01:34:49,833
-I don't think we'll ever find
better place.

1620
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:52,292
So if you would like us,

1621
01:34:52,667 --> 01:34:54,542
we would like to stay.
-Please.

1622
01:34:54,708 --> 01:34:56,000
- Huh, guys?

1623
01:34:56,917 --> 01:34:57,875
- It will be with happiness.

1624
01:34:59,833 --> 01:35:00,708
-I will help you.

1625
01:35:01,208 --> 01:35:03,250
-I was missing someone
to amputate

1626
01:35:03,417 --> 01:35:04,958
The wounded.
Laughter

1627
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:07,375
-What's happening to you?

1628
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,583
We... said we were going to Switzerland.

1629
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,167
We are almost there.
- We are fine.

1630
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:18,917
We don't know what awaits us there.
Why leave?

1631
01:35:19,083 --> 01:35:20,458
-It's true.
-Theater.

1632
01:35:20,625 --> 01:35:22,792
-Because in Switzerland, there is my mother.

1633
01:35:22,958 --> 01:35:25,250
Moving music

1634
01:35:25,417 --> 01:35:27,875
- ...

1635
01:35:28,042 --> 01:35:29,917
- But you don't have a mom.

1636
01:35:32,958 --> 01:35:34,000
- Yes, I have one.

1637
01:35:34,167 --> 01:35:43,792
- ...

1638
01:35:43,958 --> 01:35:47,875
-Everyone has a mom.
How is this a problem?

1639
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,042
- She couldn't feed me anymore.
SO…

1640
01:35:53,083 --> 01:35:56,542
She accepted a job in Switzerland…
-And what ?

1641
01:35:57,375 --> 01:36:00,625
Are you going to find her and forget about us?

1642
01:36:01,542 --> 01:36:04,292
Hold.
-A real Lulu would never have lied.

1643
01:36:04,458 --> 01:36:05,375
-Lucien.

1644
01:36:05,542 --> 01:36:06,750
Lucien !

1645
01:36:06,917 --> 01:36:15,792
- ...

1646
01:36:15,958 --> 01:36:17,167
-They will forgive you.

1647
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:22,667
- ...

1648
01:36:22,833 --> 01:36:26,292
-I've lost twice
my family because of you.

1649
01:36:29,208 --> 01:36:30,542
I hate you !

1650
01:36:31,833 --> 01:36:33,167
(I hate you…)

1651
01:36:33,333 --> 01:36:41,875
- ...

1652
01:36:48,125 --> 01:36:50,958
-Yes, he hid the truth from us.

1653
01:36:51,458 --> 01:36:53,792
But there is more serious at the moment.

1654
01:36:54,125 --> 01:36:56,458
-The war is over,
you will find your parents.

1655
01:36:56,625 --> 01:36:58,125
We will have nothing!

1656
01:36:58,292 --> 01:37:00,500
-My parents don't care about me.

1657
01:37:00,667 --> 01:37:04,125
I'm just a kid to them.
A package they abandoned.

1658
01:37:04,292 --> 01:37:06,292
Why do you believe
that I followed you?

1659
01:37:06,458 --> 01:37:07,375
-T'as eu tort !

1660
01:37:07,542 --> 01:37:10,167
You were never a Lulu.
You'll never be one.

1661
01:37:10,583 --> 01:37:13,500
-Because it's you
Who decides who is a Lulu?

1662
01:37:13,667 --> 01:37:16,208
That's it ? You're the boss ?

1663
01:37:18,125 --> 01:37:19,750
If you're the boss...

1664
01:37:19,917 --> 01:37:22,208
I'm very happy
not to be a Lulu.

1665
01:37:22,625 --> 01:37:24,667
-Children, less noise.
-Me too.

1666
01:37:25,167 --> 01:37:28,125
You only bewitched us
from the beginning !

1667
01:37:28,292 --> 01:37:31,750
The Lulus are the three of us.
-You, leave us.

1668
01:37:31,917 --> 01:37:34,250
To act crazy,
it's time to grow up.

1669
01:37:34,417 --> 01:37:37,625
-I'm not crazy.
-Are you okay, Mr. Am I the strongest?

1670
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:40,125
If you were the strongest,
we wouldn't be there.

1671
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:44,833
-You, if you were really a leader,
Where would we be?

1672
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,375
Chut!

1673
01:37:46,542 --> 01:37:50,333
-You are losers ! I never had
brothers and that’s so much the better!

1674
01:37:50,792 --> 01:37:52,083
Chut!

1675
01:37:52,667 --> 01:37:54,958
Disturbing music

1676
01:37:55,125 --> 01:37:59,167
- ...

1677
01:37:59,333 --> 01:38:01,750
Orders in German

1678
01:38:01,917 --> 01:38:03,833
- ...

1679
01:38:05,583 --> 01:38:08,542
-Colonel.
What is this morning visit worth to us?

1680
01:38:08,708 --> 01:38:14,167
- - ...

1681
01:38:14,333 --> 01:38:15,792
Why?

1682
01:38:16,333 --> 01:38:19,708
He speaks in German.

1683
01:38:19,875 --> 01:38:22,500
- ...

1684
01:38:22,667 --> 01:38:24,625
-There are no black prisoners…

1685
01:38:24,792 --> 01:38:26,083
-Madame.

1686
01:38:26,833 --> 01:38:28,667
He speaks in German.

1687
01:38:32,292 --> 01:38:34,125
-Moussa… What’s going on?

1688
01:38:34,500 --> 01:38:36,292
-We are no longer safe.

1689
01:38:39,333 --> 01:38:41,583
-We don't know it, but we're dead.

1690
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:44,000
-Chut. Chat.
owl hoot

1691
01:38:44,167 --> 01:38:46,000
- ...

1692
01:38:48,833 --> 01:38:50,000
Ludwig ?

1693
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:54,375
He says to go that way. Over there. Come on !

1694
01:38:54,542 --> 01:38:56,458
Thrilling music

1695
01:38:56,625 --> 01:39:12,792
- - ...

1696
01:39:12,958 --> 01:39:14,333
-What are we going to do ?

1697
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:15,958
-Colonel !

1698
01:39:16,792 --> 01:39:17,833
How dare you ?

1699
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,458
I know people
keep slandering us,

1700
01:39:21,625 --> 01:39:25,083
but how can you doubt me?
I tend to your wounded.

1701
01:39:26,625 --> 01:39:28,125
You can not do this.

1702
01:39:29,375 --> 01:39:32,875
You have always trusted me.
There is no one here.

1703
01:39:35,125 --> 01:39:36,625
The colonel laughs.

1704
01:39:38,333 --> 01:39:39,417
He speaks in German.

1705
01:39:40,458 --> 01:39:41,583
-Get up !

1706
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:43,042
He screams.

1707
01:39:43,208 --> 01:39:46,708
- ...

1708
01:39:46,875 --> 01:39:48,292
-I hear the train!

1709
01:39:48,458 --> 01:39:54,958
- ...

1710
01:39:55,125 --> 01:39:56,583
He speaks in German.

1711
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:58,458
-No. You will not pass.

1712
01:40:01,083 --> 01:40:03,375
The whistle you train

1713
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:05,458
- You, prisoner.

1714
01:40:07,583 --> 01:40:08,542
-Non !

1715
01:40:08,708 --> 01:40:10,292
Comrades, save the children!

1716
01:40:10,458 --> 01:40:20,583
- ...

1717
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,250
-Too late !

1718
01:40:23,417 --> 01:40:25,417
-That one ! Quickly !

1719
01:40:25,583 --> 01:40:26,958
-Go for it ! Come on !

1720
01:40:32,167 --> 01:40:34,083
- Faster, Lucas. Faster !

1721
01:40:34,542 --> 01:40:36,208
-Halt!

1722
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:40,542
-Come on, Ludwig!

1723
01:40:43,167 --> 01:40:45,875
- ...

1724
01:40:46,042 --> 01:40:47,333
Detonations

1725
01:40:49,167 --> 01:40:50,208
Run!

1726
01:40:51,708 --> 01:40:53,417
Cris d'encouragement

1727
01:40:54,208 --> 01:40:55,542
-We are almost there ! Come on !

1728
01:40:57,917 --> 01:40:58,792
-Come on, Musa!

1729
01:41:01,917 --> 01:41:03,375
Mount, mount!

1730
01:41:04,792 --> 01:41:06,000
-Moussa !

1731
01:41:06,167 --> 01:41:09,125
-Non !
-Moussa! Moussa!

1732
01:41:11,583 --> 01:41:13,292
-Send me some chocolates.

1733
01:41:13,458 --> 01:41:16,875
Melancholic music

1734
01:41:17,042 --> 01:41:20,250
gasping breath

1735
01:41:40,042 --> 01:41:41,792
Slamming of the door

1736
01:41:41,958 --> 01:41:53,917
- ...

1737
01:41:55,333 --> 01:41:57,000
- So, you have a mom.

1738
01:42:01,292 --> 01:42:03,417
-That means I have one too.

1739
01:42:03,833 --> 01:42:05,375
Because we are brothers.

1740
01:42:06,667 --> 01:42:08,292
-And me too ?

1741
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:11,000
-Oui.

1742
01:42:11,875 --> 01:42:13,750
In the end, we all have a mother.

1743
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:18,750
-Dis, Ludwig…

1744
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
What effect does it have
when a mom reads you a book?

1745
01:42:23,167 --> 01:42:25,625
Soft music

1746
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:29,542

1747
01:42:29,708 --> 01:42:32,625
