- Hi.
- Hi.

28
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:55,259
Hi. Thank you.

29
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,811
All right. We've made it.

30
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,816
Rock and roll. Rock and roll.

31
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,902
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

32
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,362
Wow.

33
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,449
Come look, buddy.

34
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,537
How cool is this?

35
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:25,706
Isn't it awesome?

36
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,669
No!

37
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,345
Do it. Put it on.

38
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,597
- Hey. Reel it in.
- Look what we have.

39
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,850
Champagne.

40
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:46,226
This is a celebration.

41
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,228
Aren't you excited
that Mommy's playing stadiums

42
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,072
this summer in Europe?

43
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,733
- Wanting to say yes.
- I don't.

44
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,611
What if I let you roller-skate?

45
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,196
- Roller-skate?
- Onstage.

46
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,739
- Onstage?
- Would you do it?

47
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,699
- No.
- In your tutu we just made?

48
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:02,493
- No.
- Why not?

49
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,161
I already go onstage.

50
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,163
Yeah, but you could come on
and sing something

51
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,208
- with an actual microphone.
- With an actual...

52
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,251
You could get a record deal.

53
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,587
Or I don't want one.

54
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:14,797
Probably smart.

55
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,007
Okay. Cheers.

56
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:24,807
Hi.

57
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,892
- How you doing?
- Ah, here we are.

58
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:28,102
How are you?

59
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,479
Mmm.

60
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,147
Me, too.

61
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,400
Hi, everybody.

62
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:41,824
Really small.

63
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,917
I enjoy getting up

64
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:55,879
and going and seeing the world
with my kids

65
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:59,925
just as much as I enjoy
nailing it onstage.

66
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,219
Why?

67
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,614
- You can play when we get back, though.
- No, I'm...

68
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,433
There are many reasons
why moms don't do this.

69
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,894
I know that it's a lot easier
for men, just primally,

70
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,605
to just walk out the door
and not look back.

71
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,649
- It-it just is.
- Hold on, buddy. Hold on.

72
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,836
Hold on. I'm gonna hand you to Mama, okay?

73
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,320
There's no way a mother
can walk away from her babies

74
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,698
and not think about them
every single second

75
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,658
of every single day
and not worry

76
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:27,494
to the point
where you can't sleep.

77
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:30,122
- For a lot of moms...
- Cheers.

78
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:33,709
...when they become moms and
they tour, they stop touring,

79
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,587
because you can't imagine
being able to do both.

80
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,339
The only way I can justify

81
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,800
dragging my family
all over the world is that

82
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,343
we're making memories together.

83
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,387
I want it to be worth it.

84
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,184
I want tour to be perfect for
every single person that walks

85
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,770
through those doors
with a ticket in their hand.

86
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,622
- And then get a small one.
- Can I have a medium one?

87
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,766
You can have that size, yes.

88
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,274
But I also want it to be

89
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,609
perfect in my kids' minds.

90
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,529
And I kill myself to do both.

91
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:04,073
There's a boat.

92
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:06,366
There's a boat.

93
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,958
It feels like 18 lifetimes ago.

94
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,002
- Hi.
- Did I want to end up here?

95
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:18,504
Yeah. Absolutely.

96
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,214
Did I think I would end up here?
Yeah.

97
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,400
I feel like you sign up for
this life before you get here.

98
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,135
You choose your parents.
You choose your obstacles.

99
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,763
You choose the lessons
that you need to learn.

100
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,366
But, also, I was just trying to
survive my day-to-day situation.

101
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:34,353
When I first went onstage,
I was not exciting.

102
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,898
My parents had just split up,
and my dad drove me,

103
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,900
and I still remember
that car ride.

104
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,194
I want to reach inside me
and hug that little girl

105
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,114
and just let her know
it's gonna be okay.

Just to walk through it.

122
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,426
- So you can just feel this space.
- Mm-hmm.

123
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,719
You know, that way,
it's not your first time

124
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,328
on Friday night, you know?

125
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:34,889
- So that's all the same.
- Yep.

126
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:37,666
- Lamps, chandelier, the travelator.
- Mm-hmm.

127
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,644
- Oh.
- So they kind of just pop up on the different runways,

128
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,468
but the scale of it
actually looks really nice

129
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:42,921
for the new stage that you have.

130
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,299
But I won't be anywhere
near Justine, either?

131
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,152
- No, it's more like...
- She'll be far away.

132
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,945
Uh-huh. They're not
gonna be as close to you.

133
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,721
Okay.

134
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,056
- So, act one, two and three I've done.
- Yes.

135
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,142
- So that's already in my body.
- Yeah.

136
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:00,439
Do we have any backup
Bob Mackie clothes here?

137
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,900
We also have the thing

Oh, we do. Yes, we have that.

- Which could be...
- That could work.

140
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,906
She could tea-dip it overnight
and make it a little redder.

141
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,158
If not, I have to go
to the red-light district

142
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,619

and for the first year
of Willow's life.

223
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,620
I've written letters to Willow,
like, on all major occasions.

224
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,622
I wrote her a letter
the day she was born.

225
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,667
I wrote her a letter the day
she went to kindergarten.

226
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,835
Every birthday.

227
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,670
And I keep it in a book.

228
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,089
I'll give it to her one day.

229
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,258
It's interesting
when you're a kid, right?

230
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,843
You think your parents are God.

231
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,220
Like, they're your first idols.

232
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,305
And they're not human beings.

233
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,891
They're just these parents,
the perfect parents.

234
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,726
They're supposed to be perfect.

235
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,814
And their one sole purpose
is to love you perfectly.

236
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,483
And then that fall from grace,
whatever age you are,

237
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,402
it's like
your first heartbreak, right?

238
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:17,922
Realizing your parents are human
and they have their own lives

239
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,490
and their own faults
and their own mistakes

240
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,992
and they can't
love you perfectly.

241
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,202
They can't even love themselves.

242
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,037
And then you go through
that struggle

243
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,582
for about ten years.

244
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,459
And then you become
their parents.

245
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,337
And you realize, like, "Wait...

246
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,840
"have you always been this way?

247
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,177
Is this why
I think like I think?"

248
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,430
Willow's never gonna feel
that way about me.

249
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,447
- Willow.
- I want cuddles.

250
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,563
- What?
- Oh, let's cuddle.

251
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:55,025
- Are you coming to the venue with me today, buddy?
- Yeah.

252
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,611
Yeah? Then I have to go get in
the shower and you have to eat,

253
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,404
so we can put clothes
on your butt,

254
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:03,200
so you can come with me
in the car to the venue.

255
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,160
- Ow.
- 'Cause it's almost rehearsal, so...

256
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,704
Ow, ow, ow.

257
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,206

00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,001

260
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,171

261

Come on. Go eat fruit.

262
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,551

No, look, try it, dude.

265
00:13:25,514 --> 00:13:27,182
Hey, look at me.

266
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,142
- I really want you to come with me.
- Uh...

267
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,620
So I need you to be ready.

268
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,079
And I know
you don't like being rushed.

269
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,583
- Ah!
- Are you listening to my words?

270
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,065
- Yeah.
- Okay, go.

271
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,667

but try this. It's sweet.

00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,621

- All right.

416
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,022
I was out, I was out of my body
the whole time.

417
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,358
See you at the hotel.

418
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,193
Tell you what,
if I were in the audience

419
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:16,614
and I were a ticket buyer and
I paid for parking and a meal

420
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:19,909
and schlepped all the way
down there and saw that show,

421
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,244
I would be disappointed.

422
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,847
I think you're
way too hard on yourself,

423
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,080
'cause the show was great.

424
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,603
- People were stoked.
- What?

425
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,375
How did it feel
back where you were?

426
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,085
Insane. People were going nuts.

427
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,962
Didn't you feel
super far away from me?

428
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:34,465
No. It feels
absolutely massive, hon.

429
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:38,136
We added
85,000 square feet of stage

430
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,638
- and kept the timing all the same.
- Oh, gotcha.

431
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,575
So we're expected to do
double the work...

432
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,892
So you're sprinting. Yeah.

433
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,393
...in the same amount of time.

434
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,478
- Yeah.
- And it is literally impossible.

435
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:48,938
Yeah.

436
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,065
I couldn't breathe
until I got to "90 Days."

437
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,191
I gotcha.

438
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,235
- Mama?
- Yes, baby?

439
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:59,532
Why did you take
a breath out me?

440
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,659
Why did I what?

441
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:05,079
Why take a breath out me, Mama?

442
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,956
- Why take a breath out of you?
- Yeah.

443
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,625
Did I take a breath out of you?

444
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,084
- Yeah.
- When?

445
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,338
- I took one of your breaths?
- Two.

446
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,548
- I took two of your breaths?
- Yeah.

447
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,216
When did I take
your breaths away?

448
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,511
Oh, you're saying
I took your breath away.

449
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,847
I get it.
He's saying he liked the show.

450
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,975
- No.
- I can't have it?

451
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,411
Come on.
Jameson, can I have a kiss?

452
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:28,913
Can I have some ketchup, please?

453
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,337
- Do what?
- Thank you.

454
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,124
- What you need, Willow?
- Where did Roger and Baz go?

455
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,566
Are they out, like, powwowing

456
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,193
on how to attack me
from both sides?

457
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,129
We're here. We were just,
we were just waiting for you.

458
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,905
Come on.

459
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:45,078
Oh, there's nothing like
a moldy, wet cork.

460
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,996
Okay.

461
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,540
- Can I cut right to the hard stuff?
- Mm-hmm.

462
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:52,835
I didn't know
that those three forks

463
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,963
were not gonna be connected.

464
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,923
I wasn't in my ear four times.

465
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:59,258
That suit
was six sizes too big,

466
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,062
so if they take it in,
it might look better.

467
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,734
And I think "Revenge"
doesn't work at all.

468
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,933
Can we send
the blow-up doll to Eminem?

469
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,267
I think he would love it.

470
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,602
The "Try" dress?

471
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,354
- Noted.
- The tit bit nipply?

472
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,022
You said,
"That's what the people want."

473
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,525
And Stephanie goes,
"That's sexual harassment."

474
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,819
That's not what I said.
I said it's sexy.

475
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,529
The black leather jacket
didn't work?

476
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,073
- Personally, I thought...
- 'Cause it's so sparkly...

477
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:23,616
But no one wants to see this.

478
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,511
- No, no, no, no.
- No, a lot of fucking...

479
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:26,855
That's what the people want.

480
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,263
That's what they want.

481
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,789
- Every time I go out...
- Yeah.

482
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,809
...I have to run all the way
up that fucking ramp,

483
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,669
I have to run all the way down
the stairs and again and back,

484
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,713
and then I have to run
all the way back again.

485
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,607
You know in your head, like,
which songs that is...

486
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,633
It's the whole show.

487
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:45,430
I can't run that fast
for two hours.

488
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:46,931
Yeah, a hundred percent.

489
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:50,476
And if I don't, the whole show
has to get reworked.

490
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,579
I get where you're coming from,
but people have to see.

491
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:55,898
Can we connect the stages
and cut out my main problem?

492
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,525
We're trying to do that.

493
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,086
We might have a problem
with Wembley...

494
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,570
I talked to Ed about it.

495
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,905
I need a pen.

496
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,657
Can it do this?

497
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,534
Here's the tip.

498
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,662
Ramp down here, ramp down here
and have it be lower.

499
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,581
- More height?
- Just like three feet.

500
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,292
And so I have something
to run down and run up.

501
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,587
It's just that... if they're
connected, I can find my times.

502
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,090
I can find the space
that I need to live.

503
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:24,093
I just don't know
if Wembley will allow that.

504
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:27,013
- We're sold out, so...
- I could just draw it up

505
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,866
first thing tomorrow morning and
send around to all the councils,

506
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,200
- and we get their approval.
- Please do.

507
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:31,601
I will. Absolutely.

508
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,686

No!

541
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,146
- Oh, wow.
- Where you going, dude?

542
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,171
This way.

543
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:24,547
- Perfect.
- We're in.

544
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,310
Shoes off
and everyone on the Biomat.

545
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,176
- Why?
- Because you guys need some zen.

546
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,260
No.

547
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:36,017
Here he comes.

548
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,768
Oh.

549
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,687
I want Willow's trumpet.

550
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,330
You want to have
a trumpet lesson?

551
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,065
Yeah.

552
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,901
Okay, ready?

553
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,611
Yeah.

554
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:49,947
It's not working.

555
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:51,199
Want to try?

556
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,677
No, you don't, you don't...

557
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,411
Not like that. Like this.

558
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:02,043
- I'm getting good, aren't I?
- No.

559
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,219
Yeah.

560
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,097
Nice. That was strong.

561
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,850
That was close.

562
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:19,852
No.

563
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:42,333
Should we cancel tour, you guys?

564
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,543
No.

565
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,254
I'm not going.

566
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:48,839
I mean, maybe, yeah, sure.

567
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:50,424
- Yeah.
- You want to cancel tour?

568
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:51,592
Hmm?

569
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,511
- Truly?
- No.

570
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,722
I just want to go to summer camp
and have a bouncy house.

571
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:59,117
You just want to go to summer
camp and have a bouncy house,

572
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,768
- but you can't.
- Yeah.

573
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,228
Because Mama's on tour.

574
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,562
- Yeah.
- And you're sad...

575
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:04,981
Like, at the worst time
possible.

576
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,482
- And you're sad about that.
- Yeah.

577
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,775
I'm sorry.

578
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,777
Do you want to go home
for a week?

579
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,112
- And go to camp?
- A week?

580
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,405
- Yeah.
- When?

581
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:13,823
Tomorrow.

582
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,032
No.

583
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:16,909
I want to stay for London.

584
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:18,744
But after that, sure. Yeah.

585
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:21,664
Okay. I'll ask Papa.

586
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,749
But then I could
come back, right?

587
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:28,796
No. Once you leave tour,
you're-you're off it forever.

588
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:30,798
Yeah, that's how it works.

589
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:33,134
You leave the circus,
they never let you back.

590
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,844
Okay, let's not do that.

591
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,472
Babe, of course
you can come back.

592
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:39,974
What do you mean,
"Can I come back?"

593
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:42,560
If you want to go home
for a week, go home for a week.

594
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:43,978
You're gonna miss me terribly.

595
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:45,563
You're gonna miss
my musk especially.

596
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:48,649
- Ew.
- But you'll get over it.

597
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,318
You'll be with
your friends for a week,

598
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,254
- you'll go to summer camp...
- Can I go to summer camp?

599
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,946
- Yes, and then you'll...
- On Monday?

600
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,198
Yeah. I will sign you up.

601
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,284
- Okay.
- Okay.

602
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:01,287
I'm not gonna cry.

603
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,581
- You're gonna cry.
- No. You are.

604
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,434
- I can see it.
- I'm not gonna cry.

605
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:06,917
Yeah, you are.

606
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,979
- No, I'm not. No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are. Yeah, you are.

607
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:10,563
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

608
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,426
Where is the other cup, Papa?

609
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,720
What other cup?

610
00:27:19,764 --> 00:27:21,390
Well, next time
you won't splash.

611
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,232
You were not doing

612
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,443
good listening.

613
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:34,487
- Do you understand that?
- Yes.

614
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,155
You do understand that?

615
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,532
Really?

616
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,534
Okay.

617
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,373
I need you to take
your punishments

618
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:48,542
- a little more seriously.
- I want to go.

619
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,002
Hold on, you're not done.

620
00:28:02,056 --> 00:28:03,391
I'm upset with you.

621
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:05,059
Sorry, Mama.

622
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,644
What are you sorry about?

623
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:08,646
Because I hit you.

624
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,022
You didn't hit me, though.

625
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,400
- Why?
- What did you actually do?

626
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,402
What?

627
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:15,736
Listen to me.

628
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,488
Look at my face.

629
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,615
I'm upset with y...

630
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,706
Do you know what I love?

631
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,876
Everyone always says, "I love
Pink 'cause she never takes any,

632
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,795
she never takes any shit."

633
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:35,047
I eat shit for breakfast.

634
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,640
Which hand? Which hand?

635
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,230
Watch the wall. God.

636
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,232
Here. You got it.

637
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,608
Here you go.

638
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:56,527
So close to bedtime.

639
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,404
Did you get your hair brushed?
Nope.

640
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:01,031
Did you use conditioner?
You did, huh?

641
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:02,741
- Mm-hmm.
- Can you look all the way up?

642
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,034
Thank you.

643
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,912
- I love you.
- I love you.

644
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,956
- Good night.
- Good night.

645
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,126
Willow, put your retainer in
and leave it.

646
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,502
- Is it in?
- Yeah.

647
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,004
Let me see.

648
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,380
- Good job.
- Good night.

649
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,090

- Papa's happy.
- Papa's happy.

675
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,079
Papa's definitely happy.
We're on bicycles.

676
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,874
- You think Willow's happy?
- Yeah.

677
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,293
Flowers and water.

678
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,336
Look at the boats.
Those are all houseboats.

679
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,842
No, I think...

680
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,098
What is his feet stuck in?

681
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,058
Ah, these two here.

682
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:34,828
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

683
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:36,312
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

684
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:37,646
Thank you.

685
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:41,317
Jameson.

686
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,319
- Good.
- Yeah, that's a good one.

687
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,737
That's the keeper.

688
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,281
- That's the keeper.
- I didn't even see that.

689
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,199
All at the same time.

690
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:54,622
Can I take a picture of you two?

691
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:57,207
- We saw you at your show tonight.
- You did?

692
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:58,751
- Excellent show.
- Yes. - Thank you.

693
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,586
Ma'am?

694
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:01,795
Yeah.

695
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,672
You're so cute.

696
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,052
Uh-huh.

697
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:09,803
Thank you.

698
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:11,805
We saw you. Thank you. Bye-bye.

699
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:13,557
My God, they look so rad.

700
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:16,060
- Why won't you dress like that with me?
- What?

701
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,943
In matching outfits
with different color hair.

702
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,022
We are. We're matching.
We're both wearing black.

703
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,690
- Score. Boom! Give me some!
- Hi.

704
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,692
Hey, look at that.
We didn't even plan that.

705
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:28,739
- Mama, watch.
- I'm watching.

706
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:33,994
Yeah, big girl.

707
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:37,206
Willow is my soul child.

708
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:41,210
Her and I are so connected
on such a deep spiritual level.

709
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,712
She's my straight man.
Like, she-she gets the joke.

710
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:46,382
She's super smart.
She's super witty.

711
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:49,551
She's so self-possessed.

712
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,428
Which is so cool.
She's always been.

713
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:53,847
She doesn't care
what anybody else is doing.

714
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:55,307
She is her own bird.

715
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,310
Especially with people her age.

716
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:00,521
She could care less.

717
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,939
She's so fearless.

718
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:04,692
But she...

719
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,402
she's internal
with her feelings,

720
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,946
which unnerves me,
and I don't understand it.

721
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,824
And she goes quiet
sometimes, and I...

722
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,285
Yeah, Willow!

723
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:18,455
All right, doors are open!

724
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,792
Time to come down!

725
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,127
My show!

726
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:27,381
It's so incredibly healing
to watch her

727
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:29,550
walk through the world
wild and free

728
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,094
and with no armor
and no heartbreak.

729
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:35,556
No one's... no one has
taught her who and how to be

730
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,475
or broken her spirit
or broken her heart.

731
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:41,979
Ow.

732
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:45,607
He's kind of blind,
so he mistakes my finger...

733
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:48,569
Or he might need glasses.

734
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:51,655
Oh, my gosh, Carlos,
you missed it.

735
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:54,575
Great.

736
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:58,704
I have to have faith
in the sarcasm and the strength

737
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:02,291
and the... the sort of weirdness

738
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:07,171
that we've celebrated
her whole life,

739
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:10,424
so far, that I think
she will be a nonconformist,

740
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:13,260
and I think she will care
a little bit less

741
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,779
what other people think
because she knows

742
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:15,888
how small the world is.

743
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,265
Or how big the world is.

744
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:21,059
And that there's people
that can be carnies and run away

745
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:22,728
and do what they want.

746
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,605
Be around people they like.

747
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:29,735
Willow told me last night
that, um, she feels invisible

748
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,361
around Jameson.

749
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:34,114
Broke my heart.

750
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:37,367
Two-year-olds get more attention
than eight-year-olds.

751
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,637
That's just the way it is,
because, at the end of the day,

752
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,706
two-year-olds are
helpless little psychopaths.

753
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,416
And they're narcissists,

754
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,519
and it's developmentally correct
for them to be that way.

755
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:48,670
And it doesn't help when...

756
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:49,963
with Jameson...

757
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,258
commanding that much attention.

758
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:55,552
And Willow was never like that
when she was his age.

759
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,221
She never wanted
that much attention.

760
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,097
She was shy about it.

761
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:01,725
For five and a half years,
it was just her and I.

762
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:05,020
And having him was...

763
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,939
like ripping a Band-Aid off.

764
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,068
Or ripping off a limb,
more like.

765
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:13,070
And it's been hard for her
the whole time.

766
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:15,072
It's never been easy for her.

767
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,115
But if she didn't have that,

768
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:19,201
what the fuck
would she complain about?

769
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,122
I did tell her, at one point,
I was like,

770
00:35:24,206 --> 00:35:26,500
"Well, your mother is
a performer who takes

771
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,752
"all the oxygen out of the room.

772
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:31,380
And then in comes your brother,
who's the mini version of me."

773
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,298
I was like,
"How could you be

774
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:35,342
anything but invisible?"

775
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,427
What'd you say, buddy?

776
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:38,971
Are you happy?

777
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,931
Yeah. I'm happy.

778
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,433
Jameson is

779
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,561
a walking, breathing,

780
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,938
naked, loose screw.

781
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:51,233
And he's as equally committed
to his anger

782
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,693
as he is to his joy.

783
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,529
In that way, he's also like me.

784
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,865
But he scares the shit
out of me.

785
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:01,577
Okay.

786
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,834
One down.

787
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,395
They look like they know
what they're doing.

788
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,882
God bless you. God bless you.

789
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:16,884
God bless you.

790
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,468
What happened?

791
00:36:18,552 --> 00:36:20,053
He sneezed into the wall.

792
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:21,471
Oh, no, buddy.

793
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:24,182
- Mommy.
- Let me see. Let me see.

794
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:26,977
Look down. Look down. Look down.

795
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,354
Yeah.

796
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,940
They're all nuts.
My whole family's crazy.

797
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:37,279

On my fifth-grade birthday party
that never was.

828
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:47,975
It was the year
my parents split up, too,

829
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,351
so it was, like, a crucial year.

830
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:50,769
Maybe this was
why they split up.

831
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,146
And my mom and I
spent all day decorating,

832
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,565
and we put streamers up
all over the walls,

833
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,484
and she gave me her ER pad

834
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,946
that I could write out
doctors' orders on,

835
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:05,450
and we put out cheese puffs,
and... no one came.

836
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,327
No one showed up.

837
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,371
I guess there was,
like, some coup

838
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:10,872
I didn't know about...

839
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,040
Really?

840
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:14,209
...where I was on the outs.

841
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,044
But my mom,

842
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:19,381
desperately trying to turn
around the day, danced with me.

843
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,258
And we ate all the cheese puffs,

844
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:23,635
and I wrote
all the doctors' orders.

845
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:26,930
And as an adult now,
I remember that day as, like,

846
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:29,683

My mom is an ER nurse
and, you know, was a single mom

856
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,672
from the time I was nine

857
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:02,650
and was getting into Broadway
and singing lessons.

858
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,676
And every year,
she would save up her money,

859
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,179
and we would get dressed up,
and we would go into the city,

860
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:10,098
and we would watch
off-Broadway plays.

861
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:12,100
We would go to
La Cage aux Folles

862
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:13,977
and The Phantom of the Opera
and Les Mis

863
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:16,521
and dinner
and all the fancy things and...

864
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:18,440
You know,
she can't afford this stuff.

865
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:23,236
And part of what we do today
on my stage is because my mom

866
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,947
saved up her money to take me
to see Phantom of the Opera.

867
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,492
My parents really did
support my passions.

868
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,077
When I wanted to sing,
they said yes.

869
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,746
When I wanted to take
gymnastics, they said okay.

870
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,290
They taught me what it meant
to work for something

871
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,334
and to take lessons
and to practice.

872
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,092
So I was a gymnast.

873
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:47,135
I used to work out
like five days a week,

874
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,054
eight hours a day.
I would miss school.

875
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,388
I had no summer camp.

876
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,015
It was just gymnastics
all the time.

877
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:54,559
I went to a Cher concert,

878
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:57,270
and I saw everything
going on behind her

879
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:59,648
and all of
these incredible acrobats

880
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:00,941
having the time of their life.

881
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,418
♪ Do you believe
in life after love... ♪

882
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,278
And I thought to myself,
"Could I do that?

883
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:09,699
'Cause that looks really fun
and no one else is doing it."

884
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:12,744
So I met Drea, and I asked her,
"Why can't a singer do this?"

885
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:15,205
She's like, "You know, you're
using your diaphragm to sing,

886
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,791
and I'm using
my diaphragm to twist."

887
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:25,423
And I love a challenge.

888
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:32,639
So we went to the jungle gym,
and I hung upside down,

889
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,016
and she just started
punching me in the stomach

890
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,893
and told me to start singing.

891
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:39,646
♪ Sweet dreams
are made of these ♪

892
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:41,523
♪ Who am I to disagree? ♪

893
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,568
I have found that it's much
harder to just stand there...

894
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,695
♪ I traveled the world

895
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,339
...than it is
to hang upside down and spin

896
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,073
at 30 miles an hour.

897
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:51,533
♪ Looking for something ♪

898
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,660
♪ Get this party started ♪

899
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:55,579
I'm a better singer upside down.

900
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,497
Watch out.

901
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,592
It just became my thing.

902
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,680
They want me to sing, too.

903
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:16,892
You know I've got the asthma.

904
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,603
We're clear on this, right?

905
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:22,063
I've got the asthma.

906
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,149
Thought it was Harry Potter.

907
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,776
God bless you.

908
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,486
Can you just say, um,

909
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,697
"I'm just gonna take a video
with Tracy Heart"?

910
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,241
- Hart? H-A-R-T?
- E-A, yeah.

911
00:41:33,325 --> 00:41:34,409
- Oh.
- Just say...

912
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:38,330
Hi. Is Dr. Gordon in today?

913
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,099
Willow has a 104 temperature
out of nowhere.

914
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:44,169
I don't know what to do.
Like, I-I... nothing's helping.

915
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,381
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

916
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:51,635
When I gave you the
Children's NyQuil last night,

917
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:52,969
did that help your cough?

918
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:55,055
I don't know. I was asleep.

919
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:58,099
Okay.

920
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,852
How long ago
did she get her Tylenol?

921
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,732
'Cause I think
it already is working.

922
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:08,401
Yeah, you already don't have a fever.

923
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:10,904
Hey, if you don't get
better soon, we're gonna have to

924
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,406
put you in, like, a
plastic tent and quarantine you.

925
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,242
- Like E.T.
- Just part of it.

926
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:17,786
- Why?
- So you don't get anybody else sick.

927
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,537
Spread your cooties.

928
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:23,124
I have to at least try
not to get what you have.

929
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,876
Are you, like, hallucinating

930
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,003
- or seeing any weird objects?
- No.

931
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:29,047
- No? Okay. That's good.
- I see a TV.

932
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,590
That's good.

933
00:42:30,674 --> 00:42:32,259
So are you milking this
right now,

934
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:35,512
so you can just, like,
binge-watch movies on the couch?

935
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:36,721
- No.
- Okay.

936
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,143
Okay. I'm gonna spray

937
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:43,979
some Thieves oil.

938
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,148
Let's roll.

939
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:49,484
The next city.

940
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,986
Ready, Willow?

941
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:55,282
She is at her neediest
when she's sick,

942
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:56,866
and I am her mother.

943
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,452
I want to care for her.

944
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:02,706
And if I get sick, I'm...

945
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:03,957
fucked.

946
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:12,090
I'm just trying
to keep you warm.

947
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,717
Do you... are you cold?

948
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,801
You are?

949
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:16,720
Papa!

950
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:19,014
I'm gonna save you!

951
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,016
You're gonna save me?

952
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:53,256
Thank you.

953
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,342
Good? You good?

954
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:02,223
I don't think Carey and I...
I don't think either one of us

955
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,225
understand what it is about us

956
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,144
that makes
our relationship work.

957
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,987
Oh, just like hitting
a brick wall, isn't it?

958
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:10,690
What's funny is,
after 19 years, today,

959
00:44:10,774 --> 00:44:15,320
right now, I've never been
happier with someone in my life.

960
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:16,946
- There it is.
- Aw.

961
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,657
When we started dating
at a very young age,

962
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:22,911
I think it was one of
the best lessons I learned,

963
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,764
where I could be a big fish
in my little pond,

964
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:26,498
but I go to the red carpet,

965
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,559
and if they even know my name,
they screw my name up

966
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:30,436
and call me Corey and Casey
and everything in between.

967
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,063
And it's like, wow, it's...

968
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:36,132
it's a lot bigger world
out there than just dirt bikes.

969
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:38,093
I also think, for you, as well,

970
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:42,138
you know, you're kind of
a-a star in your own world.

971
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:45,433
And to jump in,
especially as a man

972
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:47,977
supporting a woman on tour...

973
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:50,522
I think it's impressive
that you're able

974
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,273
to support me
the way that you do.

975
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:56,069
If it were someone else
that needed more ego stroking,

976
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:58,154
I don't think it would work.

977
00:44:58,238 --> 00:45:00,698
So we always have
an extra room for necessities,

978
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:03,284
but I only bring
the bare necessities.

979
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:06,704
I used to bring 24 suitcases.

980
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:11,418
But to keep that number, I had
to give the children a couple.

981
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:13,420
So I had to downsize.

982
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:15,296
- Hey, baby?
- Yeah?

983
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,424
I was showing them
how I downsized.

984
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:19,801
- Where?
- On my luggage.

985
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:22,679
- Come on.
- Since I had kids, I used to have 24 bags.

986
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:25,390
- How many you have now?
- 17.

987
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,267
- 17. Ask Stephanie.
- Okay.

988
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,185
Yeah, okay. I'm proud of you.
Good work.

989
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:31,271
- I left...
- Good work.

990
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,857
- ...seven bags for the kids.
- Good work. Yeah.

991
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,818
And one, two, four...
dude, you've got a lot of bags.

992
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,445
- Two. I got two bags.
- Three. Three.

993
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:40,008
And it's the same clothes
I've had for

994
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,882
- two and a half years.
- That's not mine. That's not mine,

995
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,491
- and it's in my way.
- Okay.

996
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:47,036
See? What if you need
a beanie at 2:00 a.m.?

997
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:51,040
- Hey!
- Papa's gonna drag you by your ankles.

998
00:45:51,124 --> 00:45:53,251
Drag me by my ankles.

999
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:55,378
Let's go.

1000
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,091
- Ow, that's my shin.
- Not my fault.

1001
00:46:00,175 --> 00:46:02,594
I want to do that, do that!

1002
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,596
All right.

1003
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,473
You want to get thrown one time?

1004
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:08,433
- Yeah.
- All right.

1005
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,393
Relationships are interesting.

1006
00:46:10,477 --> 00:46:12,770
There is
no perfect relationship.

1007
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:14,647
Families are interesting.

1008
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:16,941
But part of the joy
that I get out of parenting

1009
00:46:17,025 --> 00:46:18,568
is watching him be a parent.

1010
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:20,653
Come here. That's one.

1011
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:26,201
Two. One more.

1012
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:29,746
And then it's to bed, okay?
Okay?

1013
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:31,664
I knew he would be
a fantastic dad.

1014
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:34,042
I knew it because
he had a fantastic dad.

1015
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,877
Come on, meatball.

1016
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,338
But he's way better than
I thought he would be.

1017
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:41,591
He is incredibly patient.

1018
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:45,011
Otherwise, how could he be with
someone like me for this long?

1019
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:47,388
He steers Jameson in
completely the wrong direction.

1020
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:49,390
It's unsafe. It's unsmart.

1021
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:51,309
He hurts Willow's feelings
every single day.

1022
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:55,480
But he is a great dad,
and he's consistent.

1023
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:58,107
And he always shows up.
He always says yes.

1024
00:46:58,191 --> 00:47:00,377
Like, when I'm exhausted and
I don't want to do something...

1025
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:01,736
I don't want
to play in the dirt,

1026
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,339
I don't want to play
with trucks... he's like,

1027
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:05,163
"Yup, whatever you want to do,
I'm there. Yes.

1028
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:06,407
"I want to do that with you.

1029
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:07,992
I'm here right now.
Let's do it."

1030
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:10,328
And it's really, really sweet.

1031
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:11,829
Love you, dude.

1032
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:13,373
I love you.

1033
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:15,333
- Sleep good.
- Are you gonna lay down?

1034
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,002
I'm gonna lay down with you.
Of course.

1035
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:23,049
Get in your cage.

1036
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:27,095
I really wanted to be
a young dad, in theory.

1037
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,597
In reality, I would've
been gone all the time,

1038
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,099
which would've sucked.

1039
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,434
There's definitely
a part of me, like, Willow...

1040
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:36,521
I think my last contest,
Willow was a year old,

1041
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:39,190
so she'll have
no memory of me competing.

1042
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:43,152
And Jameson only has
old videos to watch.

1043
00:47:46,406 --> 00:47:48,092
No, no, no, no!

1044
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:49,760
- You've got to be kidding me!
- Yeah!

1045
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:53,079
Carey Hart has done
the unthinkable!

1046
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:55,516
Like, I wish there was a
piece that they could remember,

1047
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,917
like what they're experiencing
with Alecia.

1048
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:01,796
You know, being on tour
and seeing what Mama does,

1049
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,756
like, I-I wish I had that.

1050
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,009
But at the same time, like,

1051
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:09,929
I'm so happy I get to spend
so much time with them, 'cause,

1052
00:48:10,013 --> 00:48:13,725
you know, ten years ago,
I wouldn't have been able to.

1053
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:16,144
We live on this amazing farm
where, you know,

1054
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,104
I never had this before
in my life.

1055
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:19,498
So to have the experience
of where

1056
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:21,608
my kids can ride
their own BMX track...

1057
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:23,401
Me and Willow
go tear motorcycles around.

1058
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,320
Jameson will start riding
later this winter.

1059
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,822
And it's really fun
to kind of nurture that along

1060
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:31,284
and to kind of pass the torch
and expose them to BMX

1061
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:34,120
and, you know, going out
and pump around the pump track

1062
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:36,289
and watching Willow
kind of start to jump the jumps

1063
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:39,417
and Jameson just being
so fanatical about BMX as well,

1064
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:43,671
it's-it's fun to kind of sit
shotgun on-on their experience.

1065
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:50,845
He's that rock,
and he keeps me from myself.

1066
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,392
I still get to do
whatever I want

1067
00:48:56,476 --> 00:49:00,605
and be who I am
and chase the rainbow, but...

1068
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:03,274
I have a rock to come back to.

1069
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,329
A lot of people in my position

1070
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:17,765
like to circulate people
in and out.

1071
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:20,291
They like to find what's new,

1072
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:23,670
what's hot,
what's the bigger, better deal,

1073
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:26,297
um, and they audition
constantly.

1074
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:29,217
And I just...
I-I can't stand auditioning.

1075
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,095
I am of the mind that
if you find a really good person

1076
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:34,055
that's really good
at what they do

1077
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:37,183
and wants to work really hard,
then you keep them forever.

1078
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:39,185
Let them be 85 on that stage.

1079
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,104
Uh, 'cause I'm gonna be.

1080
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:44,649
And it's not hard to keep
those people once you find them.

1081
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:46,734
You just have to
treat them well.

1082
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:49,987
Oh, thank you.

1083
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:51,406
Thank you.

1084
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:01,499
I think that's part of

1085
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:03,501
why people like being
on the road with me

1086
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,304
is because they feel safe
and they feel like

1087
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:07,088
they can be themselves,
and they feel like

1088
00:50:07,171 --> 00:50:10,341
I really want them
to bring their full self

1089
00:50:10,425 --> 00:50:12,009
and their whole heart.

1090
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:14,345
And I think one of the reasons
I'm successful is because

1091
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:16,490
I surround myself with people
that are better than me.

1092
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,516
I'm not intimidated by
other people's greatness.

1093
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:19,976
I want all of us to be great.

1094
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,578
And that's why we have
such a rad tour.

1095
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:24,230
It's because, if you're not
looking at me onstage,

1096
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:27,400
if you've had enough of me,
then you can look anywhere else

1097
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:29,086
and you're gonna see
the best of the best,

1098
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,130
and you're gonna see people
that are lit up with joy,

1099
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:34,407
that are fully alive
and fully in their light,

1100
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:38,035
and it's-it's a beautiful thing
to behold and to share.

1101
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:39,162
Hi, guys!

1102
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:40,747
Go faster!

1103
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,331
No, I'm good.

1104
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:47,170
Okay, never mind.

1105
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,965
Yeah, I'll stay on.

1106
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,884
Oh, yeah, I'm staying on,
just like this.

1107
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:54,677
Oh, no, no! We're going down!

1108
00:50:54,761 --> 00:50:56,321
It's fun to watch
the relationships,

1109
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:57,990
the different kind of
relationships that Willow has

1110
00:50:58,014 --> 00:50:59,432
on tour with my village.

1111
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:01,476
There's a lot of bumps.

1112
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,103
And then how Jameson
just entertains everybody.

1113
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:12,278
I worry, actually, about
taking them on the road

1114
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:16,032
and having the...
the tolls of that,

1115
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:18,367
uh, them not having
a normal life.

1116
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:21,370
But I look around at the people
that we're surrounded by,

1117
00:51:21,454 --> 00:51:23,748
and we're surrounded by people
of all walks of life,

1118
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:27,627
incredibly diverse,
and we go all over the world,

1119
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:30,588
and we have culture
around us all the time.

1120
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,483
And it's all people
that are incredibly passionate

1121
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:34,592
about what they do,

1122
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:37,595
fearless in
their choice to do it,

1123
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:39,806
and they get to be around
these people all day long.

1124
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:42,141
There's people that you can
just really want something

1125
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:45,478
and go after it,
and then you'll find people

1126
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:47,241
that you're surrounded by
that are amazing.

1127
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:49,106
And that's what
my kids get to see.

1128
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:51,400
Every door they walk through,
every room they walk into,

1129
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:52,836
they're like,
"Wow, there's another person

1130
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,320
that followed their dreams."

1131
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:57,406
I think that that's more of
an education than I got.

1132
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:59,116
Now do a cartwheel.

1133
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,677
- Yeah, backflips.
- Oh, you got the backflip.

1134
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:02,286
- Do the cartwheel.
- How?

1135
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:06,082
Just literally turn yourself
sideways and do a cartwheel.

1136
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:07,542
Use your arms.

1137
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,085
- Yeah.
- There you go. -

1138
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:10,562
This is our second with kids.

1139
00:52:10,586 --> 00:52:12,105
The first one was
a huge learning curve.

1140
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,881
It was a lot different than just

1141
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:15,525
partying on the road
with my girlfriend,

1142
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:17,009
or wife at that time.

1143
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:18,761
And kids add
a crazy extra layer,

1144
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:21,764
but, you know,
it-it is a family.

1145
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:23,808
I mean, these people have been

1146
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:27,645
touring with Alecia
for over a decade.

1147
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,605
Just a traveling gypsy family.

1148
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:32,483
And, I mean, it's literally
as fun as it could possibly be.

1149
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:36,237
The kids absolutely enjoy it
and love everybody on tour,

1150
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,614
and I would call
everybody on tour my friend,

1151
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:41,784
and I think that's pretty huge
in this dynamic.

1152
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:51,252
I try to allow
for everybody on that stage

1153
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:53,170
to be human and not robots.

1154
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:55,298
And, no, I don't want anyone
to be perfect.

1155
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:58,009
I want everybody to have
their own personality

1156
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,219
and their own moment
to just let their hair down.

1157
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:03,764
That's what it's all about.
It's about being free and wild.

1158
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:07,894
You know, we have to be
a bit rehearsed, but...

1159
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:10,938
We have to know
kind of what we're doing.

1161

00:53:15,902 --> 00:53:17,695
is because I really want them.

1163

There's Mama over there.

1190
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:30,685
This is, this is the one?

1191
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:31,936
Okay.

1192
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:36,524
There's no precedent

1193
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,693
for any of this stuff
that we're doing.

1194
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:42,655
I'm the first person that's
doing a lot of these things.

1195
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:46,242
Mama! Mama!

1196
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:47,743
What is that?

1197
00:54:47,827 --> 00:54:49,912
I'm gonna go fly now.

1198
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:51,914
- Why?
- 'Cause it's so fun.

1199
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:57,044
There have been
many close calls.

1200
00:54:57,128 --> 00:55:00,715
The 360 has been the only thing
where I really got hurt.

1201
00:55:03,134 --> 00:55:05,094
I've got my two dancers ready

1202
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:06,762
to grab the carabiners
and hook me in.

1203
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:08,514
Are y'all ready?

1204
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:10,909
And one of the carabiners was
pointing the wrong direction,

1205
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,935
which made Nikki
really, really uncomfortable,

1206
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:14,854
and she kind of froze.

1207
00:55:20,609 --> 00:55:21,861
I'm fine.

1208
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,696
Oh, fuck, that hurt
like a motherfucker.

1209
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:25,448
Sorry for cursing.

1210
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:28,492
Fuck. I fucking did that.

1211
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:29,952
Who the fuck was watching?

1212
00:55:30,036 --> 00:55:32,788
Holy shit.

1213
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:35,332
- Let's get her out of it.
- I can't feel anything.

1214
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,501
Normally, I'm connected
by two carabiners,

1215
00:55:37,585 --> 00:55:39,879
so if it pulls you,
it pulls you equally.

1216
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:42,402
If you don't have one carabiner,
you get pulled off the stage,

1217
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:44,300
into the barricade
at 30 miles an hour.

1218
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,470
I was really scared
to keep doing it after that.

1219
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:49,472
I was shook. That shook me up.

1220
00:55:50,723 --> 00:55:52,641
Got to get back on the horse.
Let's go.

1221
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:54,310
I'm not gonna miss
a beautiful day

1222
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:56,729
just 'cause the day before hurt.

1223
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,898
- Do you know what I have to do?
- No.

1224
00:55:58,981 --> 00:56:00,483
I have to do my vocal warm-up.

1225
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,986
Something like...

1226
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,362
Hey. Hey.

1227
00:56:05,446 --> 00:56:06,864
Hey, hey, hey.

1228
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,032
Papa can take you.

1229
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,284
Where is Papa?

1230
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,369
Let's go find out where Papa is.

1231
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:19,668
- Stephanie.
- Hi, sweet boy.

1232
00:56:21,212 --> 00:56:22,713
Mom fail.

1233
00:56:24,924 --> 00:56:26,425
It's okay. I'm a Jew.

1234
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:28,278
I don't really know anything
other than guilt,

1235
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,429
so... it's fine.

1236
00:56:30,513 --> 00:56:31,847
It's all good.

1244
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:57,957
I think,
before I became a parent,

1245
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,376
I didn't want to be a parent,
'cause I didn't want to have

1246
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,212
the kind of relationship
that my mom and I had.

1247
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:05,131
And I was terrified of it.

1248
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:07,675
So I think
my initial motivation was:

1249
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:10,803
"I'm gonna do everything I can
to be close to this person

1250
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:14,056
and to let this person be
whoever they are."

1251
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:15,516
As it happened, it just...

1252
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,601
It's like saying,
"If I win that Grammy,

1253
00:57:17,685 --> 00:57:19,562
"I'm gonna get up there and say,

1254
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:21,063
"'Fuck my high school principal.

1255
00:57:21,147 --> 00:57:22,523
I fucking told you
I'd get here.'"

1256
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,942
But by the time you do
all the work and you get there

1257
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:26,944
and you win the Grammy,
you get up there

1258
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,571
and you're just happy
and grateful,

1259
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:31,282
and you're just like, "I'm not
even thinking about that guy."

1260
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:34,326
So when you become a parent,
it's the same exact feeling.

1261
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:37,079
It's like, "I was gonna do
everything different,"

1262
00:57:37,163 --> 00:57:38,914
and, blah, and you just...

1263
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:40,541
The thing that
surprised me the most

1264
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:44,086
was that none of that mattered
and I really loved being a mom.

1265
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:45,421
I loved being a mom.

1266
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:47,047
My mom said to me...

1267
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:50,718
it was one of the greatest gifts
of my life...

1268
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:53,470
she said to me, when Willow was
about three and a half or four,

1269
00:57:53,554 --> 00:57:55,574
she looked at me with tears
in her eyes and she said,

1270
00:57:55,598 --> 00:57:57,308
"I just never knew

1271
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:59,602
"that parenting could be
this enjoyable

1272
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,937
until I saw you do it."

1273
00:58:02,021 --> 00:58:03,898
Willow!

1274
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:23,250
This person wrote, "Live from

Wow. That's a lot of shows.

1286

do the show.

01:01:56,672 --> 01:01:59,091
- That's awesome.
- Sweet, huh?

1372
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:02,302
Yeah. You make a huge impact
on people's lives.

1373
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:04,972
Yeah.

1374
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,473
- I do.
- I know you do.

1375
01:02:06,557 --> 01:02:08,684
- Especially yours.
- That's true.

1376
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:11,103
Especially mine.

1377
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:14,648
And it's really the only reason
I still do this.

1378
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:18,986
'Cause the... the chasing
the carrot game is stupid.

1379
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:21,321
- Mm-hmm.
- But the fulfillment in that...

1380
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:24,324
- Even the shit we've been through.
- Yeah.

1381
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:26,535
Like, writing about all of that.

1382
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:29,163
- Yeah.
- Other people are just like...

1383
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:30,682
Somebody's in
their kitchen somewhere,

1384
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:34,001
staring at their husband,
going, "Yep.

1385
01:02:35,919 --> 01:02:38,338
Yep. I feel that, too."

1386
01:02:38,422 --> 01:02:41,467
But then they want
to fight it out another day.

1387
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,845
It's cool, man. Music is cool.

1388
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:48,199
That's why I've always said
you're the people's champ.

1389
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:50,017
- I'm Rocky?
- You are.

1390
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,060
I hope I'm a little more
attractive than Rocky.

1391
01:02:52,144 --> 01:02:53,687
No, you're the peop...

1392
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,373
Like, no, I'm serious.
You're the people's champ.

1393
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:57,816
- Like, you're...
- Do I give you Sylvester Stallone vibes?

1394
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,194

1429
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:51,805
But it's taking forever.

1430
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:54,349
Tomorrow, what Willow and I
are gonna do,

1431
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:57,978
we're gonna go have high tea
and... see Matilda.

1432
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:02,816
And then Saturday and Sunday,
we're shooting.

1433
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,068
And then Willow and Carey
go home.

1434
01:05:05,152 --> 01:05:07,779
And I made a little
sad face with tears.

1435
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,950
And then, uh, we go to Paris.

1436
01:05:12,034 --> 01:05:14,036
And I'm just trying
to wrap my head around,

1437
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:18,040
'cause Carey usually does
the morning time with the kids,

1438
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:20,417
'cause I don't get to sleep
until really late.

1439
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,961
So I just have to figure that
out and wrap my head around it,

1440
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:25,380
'cause it just changes things
a little bit.

1441
01:05:25,464 --> 01:05:28,091
Is that true?
The Smurfs are Belgian?

1442
01:05:28,175 --> 01:05:31,011
- Wow. They are.
- Yeah.

1443
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:36,475
Where do french fries come from?

1444
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:37,893
Gonna say France.

1445
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:39,478
Belgium!

1446
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:42,606
Did chocolate originate
in Belgium?

1447
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:44,107
If this comes back Belgium...

1448
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,984
Latin America.
All right, we're good.

1449
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:01,792

01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,794
- Oh, you look super excited.
- Ha. Well...

01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:06,171
- Look at that excitement.
- I just woke up.

Come on! Get hyped. Get psyched.

- Where?
- On the balcony across the street.

1457
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:17,224
This way.
What's he doing on the balcony?

1458
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:19,160
That's the queen's horse.

1459
01:06:19,184 --> 01:06:20,477

- Yeah.
- Okay.

1479
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:03,729
- Hey, Pink.
- Hi, everybody.

1480
01:07:03,812 --> 01:07:06,231
- Thank you so much.
- All right.

1481
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:08,233
Thank you.

1482
01:07:08,316 --> 01:07:09,860
- Yep.
- Okay. Vitamins...

1483
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:11,862
There you go.
Candy water for you.

1484
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,464
- No, my other cup, Mama.
- Vitamins are over here.

1485
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:14,698
Food is right here.

1486
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:16,426
But, baby, that's the only cup
that we brought.

1487
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,868
Yep, that's what we got, dude.

1488
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,703
Buddy, I have meatballs

1489
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:22,122
and bell pepper and tomatoes
and hummus and pita.

1490
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:23,623
Mama.

1491
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:24,916
Yes, buddy. You hungry?

1492
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,793
I want waffles.

1493
01:07:26,877 --> 01:07:29,629
Oh, buddy, I can't make you
waffles on a tour bus.

1494
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:32,048
I love hummus spot.

1495
01:07:32,132 --> 01:07:34,760
Oh, the hummus spot?
Aw, yeah, you do.

1496
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:36,654
Well, he can eat the salmon.
I'll eat the meatballs.

1497
01:07:36,678 --> 01:07:38,472
I don't care.

1498
01:07:47,189 --> 01:07:49,107
Stuff's a piece of cake.

1499
01:07:49,191 --> 01:07:51,193
Yeah.

1500
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:53,403
This whole touring thing.

1501
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:56,698
Place is huge.

1502
01:07:56,782 --> 01:07:58,992
Are you gonna sing here?

1503
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,119
I'm gonna sing right there.

1504
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:03,872
- Right here?
- Yeah, to all the people.

1505
01:08:05,207 --> 01:08:06,416

1509
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:15,592
- We made it.
- You made it.

1510
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,594
We made it

1511
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:19,513
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1512
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:21,598
- Guys, I really love this stadium.
- I know.

1513
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,809
- Can you fucking believe it?
- I know.

1514
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:25,435
- Oh, my God.
- Get in here.

1515
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:27,604
Big hug. Oh!

1516
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,248
Careful that don't whack you
in the head.

1517
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:30,565
It's a, it's a bucket list, man.

1518
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:32,526
Yeah, this is definitely
a bucket list.

1519
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:34,736
Oh, my God. And two nights.

1520
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:37,239
- I know.
- No, not just one. It's two.

1521
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:58,927
My kids have never seen me
as anything other than this.

1522
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:01,680
They've only ever
known me as this.

1523
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,181
Mama.

1524
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:25,620
They grew up with
the hotels and the jets

1525
01:09:25,704 --> 01:09:27,581
and the never having
to worry about

1526
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:29,457
things like money and safety,

1527
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:31,251
and I'm their mom,
I'm their friend,

1528
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:33,169
but one day, you know,

1529
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:35,922
one day, they're gonna
see through all of it.

1530
01:09:36,006 --> 01:09:37,632
They're gonna see the act.

1531
01:09:37,716 --> 01:09:39,593
They're gonna see
through the strength,

1532
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:42,304
and they're gonna find
the truth underneath, I hope.

1533
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:44,222
And they're gonna discover
little Alecia,

1534
01:09:44,306 --> 01:09:46,558
who's still hiding in here,

1535
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:49,269
who's still learning
how to heal.

1536
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:52,647
And I just hope they have
the grace and the heart

1537
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:57,444
to accept my mortality and to
accept that I'm human like them.

1538
01:09:57,527 --> 01:09:59,571
And then they'll have
their own kids,

1539
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:02,407
and so the cycle continues,
all of it.

1540
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:05,744
The multigenerational pain,
sure, but also...

1541
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:08,371
the damn beauty of it all.

1542
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:22,302
That's cool.

1543
01:10:22,385 --> 01:10:25,138
I'd like to
have time to do the moonwalk.

1544
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:45,241
I used to do
my own hair and makeup,

1545
01:10:45,325 --> 01:10:47,077
but I realized that I need help.

1546
01:10:49,621 --> 01:10:53,833
I do my own hair because, number
one, I don't have that much,

1547
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:56,294
and number two,
it's pretty much the only time

1548
01:10:56,378 --> 01:10:59,631
I get to be alone...
in my world.

1549
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,257
And...

1550
01:11:01,341 --> 01:11:03,259
it is meditative.

1551
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:04,803
It's... it's a ritual.

1552
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:08,014
I enjoy rituals,
and that's my ritual.

1553
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:11,142
And, also, no one can do

1554
01:11:11,226 --> 01:11:13,228
this hair quite like I can.

Yeah.

1565
01:12:15,623 --> 01:12:18,251
People from Greece,
came from Lithuania,

1566
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,754
- came from Australia...
- Oh.

1567
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,338
- Japan.
- Japan.

1568
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:23,942
- Yeah, I saw that.
- What?

1569
01:12:25,133 --> 01:12:26,509
80,000.

1570
01:12:26,593 --> 01:12:28,136
Wow.

1571
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,559
I think it's hilarious.

1572
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:36,144
I was supposed to be
a rock star,

1573
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:37,771
so I never had to be
anywhere early,

1574
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:40,398
I never had to do anything
I didn't want to do,

1575
01:12:40,482 --> 01:12:44,778
and now I'm in charge of 225
people and two insane children

1576
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:47,739
and all of this
mega, mega responsibility,

1577
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:49,783
and it's all worked out okay.

1578
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:52,660
- Mom!
- I'm busy and important.

1579
01:12:52,744 --> 01:12:56,122
You have to make
an-an appointment to hug me.

1580
01:12:56,206 --> 01:12:58,124
- I'm important now.
- Appointment made.

1581
01:12:58,208 --> 01:13:00,877
Get off me.

1582
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,129
Did I mention
how important I am?

1583
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:04,881
- I'm gonna get up.
- Okay.

1584
01:13:04,964 --> 01:13:07,092
If you're gonna do that,
then just get on this way.

1585
01:13:07,175 --> 01:13:08,510
Okay.

1586
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:11,054
- Seriously?
- Yeah, 'cause I need you on my back.

1587
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:12,990
- All right, everybody!
- Nope. Oh, yeah.

1588
01:13:17,811 --> 01:13:19,270
Have a wonderful show.

1589
01:13:19,354 --> 01:13:20,994
You, too. You, too.

1590
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:22,708
- It's just another show.
- - Yeah.

1591
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:24,150
- What you got?
- Big, I guess.

1592
01:13:24,234 --> 01:13:26,653
- It's all good.
- You got one, too.

1593
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,196
Wow!

1594
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:30,031
All right, I would
like to say thank you

1595
01:13:30,115 --> 01:13:32,325
for bringing us together
and keeping us together.

1596
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:36,746
- We're all incredibly blessed to be here.
- Yes.

1597
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:39,791
- Mm-hmm.
- We're blessed to be here together.

1598
01:13:39,874 --> 01:13:43,086
We worked really, really hard
to get here.

1599
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:45,296
All those times,
all those journeys,

1600
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:48,091
all those obstacles,
all those roadblocks,

1601
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:52,345
all those voices saying, "Not
enough, not enough, not enough,"

1602
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,305
we're here.

1603
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:57,016
All those times you didn't
listen to your own voices,

1604
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:00,311
"Not enough, not enough,
not enough," we are here.

1605
01:14:00,395 --> 01:14:02,438
But it's
Wembley fucking Stadium!

1606
01:14:05,525 --> 01:14:07,694
I respect all of you so much.

1607
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:09,612
Thank you
for being here with me.

1608
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:11,423
Bless that stage with
safety, love and light.

1609
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:12,949
Bless our crew with safety.

1610
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:14,826
Bless our apparatuses
with safety.

1611
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:17,078
And let us just continue
our journey

1612
01:14:17,162 --> 01:14:19,205
of balancing good and evil.

1613
01:14:20,915 --> 01:14:23,084
For this
and a katrillion, gazillion,

1614
01:14:23,168 --> 01:14:25,086
gabillion more things,
we are grateful.

1615
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:27,172
Amen, a-lady!

1616
01:14:31,718 --> 01:14:32,886
One, two, three!

1617
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:35,054
Spread the love!

1618
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:37,599
- Have a good show, everybody.
- Have a good show!

1619
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:39,601
- Give your best, baby.
- Thank you.

1620
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:41,102
Come on,
let's go watch the show.

1621
01:14:41,186 --> 01:14:42,562
Hi there.

1622
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:47,275
Do we have to drive
to the stadium?

1623
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:51,571
Have fun, okay? I love you.

1624
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:53,072
All right, Mama, kick ass.

1625
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:55,116
Thank you. I'm planning on it.

1626
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,659
- Mama?
- Yes?

1627
01:14:56,743 --> 01:14:58,453
During the show a little bit,

1628
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:01,414
um, can I come back
to the ball pit?

1629
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,791
- You can live your best life.
- Okay, good.

1630
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:05,835
But if you leave the show,
you ain't getting paid.

1631
01:15:08,379 --> 01:15:09,815
- That's how it goes.
- Sorry, buddy.

1632
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:10,965
All right, have fun.

1633
01:15:11,049 --> 01:15:12,484
Can't leave work.

1634
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,777
Either you're working
or you're not.

1635
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:15,595
All right, here we go.

1636
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:17,347
Let's go shoot some shit.

1637
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:20,183
- Coming out this side?
- Some stuff.

1638
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:22,352
Yeah. Sure.

1639
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:23,937
Bad words.

1640
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:26,189
Go. I know. Tour language.

1641
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,482
Get out.

1642
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,383
A long time ago, I decided

1643
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:38,135
that no matter where I went
or what I did with my life,

1644
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,036
I was always gonna be
very true to myself.

1645
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:43,623
I have always identified
with people that struggle.

1646
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:47,252
With all the strife
and economic woes in the world,

1647
01:15:47,335 --> 01:15:49,921
religious intolerance,
global warming,

1648
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:53,174
it boggles my mind that we're
spending time, energy and money

1649
01:15:53,258 --> 01:15:55,009
trying to ban love.

1650
01:15:55,093 --> 01:15:56,528
I don't want there to be
gay marriage.

1651
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,179
I just want there to be
happy marriage

1652
01:15:58,263 --> 01:16:00,139
and lasting marriage.

1653
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:01,641
I will do everything I can

1654
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:03,768
to open people's hearts,
ears, minds.

1655
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:05,246
- I love you until the world blows up...
- And I have

1656
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:07,272
to believe
that change is possible,

1657
01:16:07,355 --> 01:16:09,023
because if I stop
believing that,

1658
01:16:09,107 --> 01:16:10,376
- I love you until the world blows up...
- then it's just

1659
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,652
a little too much for me.

1660
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:15,029
So I have a pen and I write.

1661
01:16:15,113 --> 01:16:16,698
I write about that.

Okay. I can probably do that.

01:24:10,755 --> 01:24:13,299
Okay.

01:24:13,382 --> 01:24:14,925

All right. Here we go.

01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:23,809
Ready?

1806
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:31,400
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Was that it?

1807
01:24:31,484 --> 01:24:32,818
- No.
- No.

1808
01:24:32,902 --> 01:24:34,779

1812
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,748
Where you going?

1813
01:24:45,831 --> 01:24:47,958
I was throwing out
the booger diaper,

1814
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:50,377
getting my wine
and joining you on the couch.

1815
01:24:50,461 --> 01:24:51,796
Guess what, buddy.

1816
01:24:51,879 --> 01:24:54,298
- What?
- I think I hurt my shoulder.

1817
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:56,675
- Sorry.
- It's not your fault.

1818
01:24:56,759 --> 01:24:58,344
This part.

1819
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:00,554
I think I did it in the show.

1820
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:02,932
- Sorry.
- Aw, thanks.

1821
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:06,519
- Ow.
- Ow.

1822
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:08,020
Oh.

1823
01:25:09,396 --> 01:25:11,482
Thought he was coming
to try and make me feel better

1824
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:14,610
for a second, but he wasn't.

1825
01:25:14,693 --> 01:25:16,821
- Hey, you, come here.
- No. Why?

1826
01:25:16,904 --> 01:25:18,364
- Come here.
- Why, Papa?

1827
01:25:18,447 --> 01:25:20,115
- 'Cause I got to talk to you.
- What?

1828
01:25:20,199 --> 01:25:21,367
So sit down.

1829
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:25,830
So you know me and Willow
are leaving tomorrow, right?

1830
01:25:25,913 --> 01:25:29,667
So we're gonna be gone
for 12 days.

1831
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:31,126
Why?

1832
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:33,271
Well, 'cause Willow wants
to go home for a little bit

1833
01:25:33,295 --> 01:25:35,214
- to go see her friends, okay, buddy?
- Why?

1834
01:25:35,297 --> 01:25:37,341
'Cause she misses them.

1835
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:39,635
I know.

1836
01:25:39,718 --> 01:25:42,096
- So, hey, here's what I need of you.
- Yeah.

1837
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:44,682
- I need you to be a good boy for Mama.
- Yeah.

1838
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:47,476
And I need you
to FaceTime me and Willow.

1839
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,019
Yeah.

1840
01:25:49,103 --> 01:25:51,981
And I need you to have fun
while we're gone, okay, dude?

1841
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:53,315
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1842
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:55,484
I'm really excited for you.

1843
01:25:55,568 --> 01:25:57,820
- You know what I'm most excited about?
- What?

1844
01:25:57,903 --> 01:26:00,048
That you were able to tell me
that you wanted to go home

1845
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:01,740
and be with your friends
and have camp.

1846
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:04,118
I'm really proud of you
for that.

1847
01:26:04,201 --> 01:26:05,536
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1848
01:26:05,619 --> 01:26:07,621
That was really brave
and awesome.

1849
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:11,917
And I love you.

1850
01:26:12,001 --> 01:26:14,378
And I'll miss you,
but I'll be totally fine.

1851
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:16,964
- I'm gonna be okay.
- I bet.

1852
01:26:17,047 --> 01:26:20,092
I'm not gonna hyperventilate
and cry tomorrow.

1853
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:21,886
I'll be fine.

1854
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:23,888
I'm not gonna text you
every five minutes.

1855
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:25,389
You might hyperventilate.

1856
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:27,016
Every six. How is every six?

1857
01:26:27,099 --> 01:26:29,019
Does six feel good?
Six minutes feel good to you?

1858
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,269
Sure.

1859
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:32,563
No. You have fun.

1860
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:34,273
I love you.

1861
01:26:40,571 --> 01:26:41,864
Jameson?

1862
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:43,508
- What?
- Willow really wants a cuddle

1863
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:44,968
from you before she leaves,
'cause she's gonna miss you.

1864
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,970
Can you give Willow
a cuddle? 'Cause Willow's

1865
01:26:46,994 --> 01:26:50,039
- going with me tomorrow.
- Can I have a cuddle?

1866
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:52,333
Aw.

1867
01:26:54,168 --> 01:26:56,170
That's really nice.

1868
01:26:57,254 --> 01:26:58,881
That's it.

1869
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:00,966
It's about all he's good for.
He's a boy.

1870
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:03,886
This is gonna be Jameson's
first trip away from Willow.

1871
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:05,387
Good night.

1872
01:27:05,471 --> 01:27:07,890
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, buddy.

1873
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:10,684
Hey, do I get a kiss?

1874
01:27:10,768 --> 01:27:12,728
- Yeah.
- - Yeah.

1875
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:17,441
Love you, buddy.

1876
01:27:17,524 --> 01:27:19,777
Don't you wipe my kisses off.

1877
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,739
You're gonna be just fine.

1878
01:27:25,324 --> 01:27:26,533
Okay?

1879
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:28,661

- Bye.
- Bye.

1881
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:43,425

is very healthy.

Thank you!

1963
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,147
Thank you!

1964
01:32:47,604 --> 01:32:49,648
- How did it feel?
- Amazing.

1965
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:51,358
- Yeah?
- Amazing!

1966
01:32:51,441 --> 01:32:53,026
- Congratulations, baby.
- Thank you.

1967
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:54,486
- You kicked ass.
- Thank you.

1968
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:56,863
I usually can't feel anything
like this, you know?

1969
01:32:56,947 --> 01:32:58,627
- No!
- Like, nothing touches you.

1970
01:32:58,657 --> 01:33:00,867
It's just not real.
But onstage tonight...

1971
01:33:00,951 --> 01:33:02,831
Like, even driving here,
I was like, "Whatever."

1972
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,681
- Yeah. Just another night.
- It's not real.

1973
01:33:04,705 --> 01:33:06,349
It's just, it's not...
well, it's just not real.

1974
01:33:06,373 --> 01:33:07,725
- It doesn't register.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1975
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:09,060
It's just like,
"Okay, we're doing a stadium.

1976
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:10,377
Why? Who? What?"

1977
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:12,713
By "Who Knew," I was like,
"Wow, this is powerful."

1978
01:33:12,796 --> 01:33:14,190
And they all sing along
on that, too.

1979
01:33:14,214 --> 01:33:15,465
They know every word.

1980
01:33:15,549 --> 01:33:16,967
And it's from so long ago.

1981
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:18,343
Yeah.

1982
01:33:18,427 --> 01:33:19,761
And "Pill," too.

1983
01:33:19,845 --> 01:33:21,513
- Like, all those old songs.
- Yeah.

1984
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:23,390
- No. I want...
- And people just...

1985
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:25,684
But then, when I was onstage
and I was looking out,

1986
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:28,395
I was like, "Wow, this is major."

1987
01:33:29,479 --> 01:33:31,440
When's the power
gonna come back on?

1988
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:32,899
Let me see.

1989
01:33:33,859 --> 01:33:34,901
It's the outfit.

1990
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:35,986
It's because I look like

1991
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:37,237
a Snapchat filter.

1992
01:33:38,322 --> 01:33:39,762
- I love you!
- Oh, my God.

1993
01:33:39,823 --> 01:33:41,867
He's like
a junior high wrestler.

1994
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:43,660
Love you!

1995
01:33:43,744 --> 01:33:44,870
Damn, I'm good.

1996
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:46,288
Hey, look, it's me.

1997
01:33:48,123 --> 01:33:49,666
What if it goes out

1998
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:51,519
- for the whole night?
- I'm not getting anything.

1999
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:53,253
Who's Kiki?

2000
01:33:53,337 --> 01:33:56,840
That's... the people
that the doggy is.

2001
01:33:56,923 --> 01:33:58,050
- Oh.
- What?

2002
01:33:58,133 --> 01:33:59,843
The people and the doggy.

2003
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:02,095
Nope, still nothing.

2004
01:34:02,179 --> 01:34:04,264
- Kiki.
- Who is Kiki?

2005
01:34:04,348 --> 01:34:06,016
Do you have a girlfriend
named Kiki?

2006
01:34:06,099 --> 01:34:07,517
- Yeah.
- Jameson.

2007
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:08,977
No, Kiki!

2008
01:34:09,061 --> 01:34:10,729
- She's Kiki?
- Yeah.

2009
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:12,564
Willow is Kiki?

2010
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:16,276
Okay.

2011
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:17,569
Stop, stop.

2012
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:18,987
What?

2013
01:34:19,071 --> 01:34:20,572
Did you just say "stop"?

2014
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:22,115
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

2015
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:23,825
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

2016
01:34:23,909 --> 01:34:26,453
So much.
I'm proud to be your mother.

2017
01:34:26,536 --> 01:34:28,663
- Please get off my stage.
- Why?

2018
01:34:28,747 --> 01:34:30,082
Willow, get off it.

2019
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:31,976
- Get off the stage.
- Willow.

2020
01:34:35,754 --> 01:34:37,964
- Come on, sing with me this summer.
- Mm-mm.

2021
01:34:38,048 --> 01:34:40,217
It might be a long time again
before I go on tour,

2022
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:42,010
and then you'll be older
and you'll hate me

2023
01:34:42,094 --> 01:34:43,762
and you won't talk to me.

2024
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:46,598
- Do it while...
- That's excessive.

2025
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:48,517
Excessive?

2026
01:34:58,819 --> 01:35:01,071
Of course you can do that.

2027
01:35:02,155 --> 01:35:03,407
This one's fine.

2028
01:35:03,490 --> 01:35:05,951
Can you hear me?

2029
01:35:06,034 --> 01:35:07,327
Exactly. "Oh, no."

2030
01:35:07,411 --> 01:35:08,829
I know this part.

2031
01:35:08,912 --> 01:35:10,747
"Don't try to hustle me."

2032
01:35:10,831 --> 01:35:12,332
And then boom.

2033
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:17,879
And we had been saying,
every night, "Phoenix!"

2034
01:35:17,963 --> 01:35:20,507
"Phoenix!"

2035
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:23,218
Second show,
we were in Las Vegas:

2036
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:24,511
"Phoenix!"

2037
01:35:24,594 --> 01:35:27,389
In my head, nailed it.

2038
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:29,850
Microphone drop.
No one's ever done it like me.

2039
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:32,310
I walk back,
the whole family's there,

2040
01:35:32,394 --> 01:35:35,063
and Carey turns around and
before saying anything to me...

2041
01:35:35,147 --> 01:35:36,982
"good show,"
"congratulations"...

2042
01:35:37,065 --> 01:35:38,692
"Phoenix."

2043
01:35:38,775 --> 01:35:40,777
It was like, "Phoenix."

2044
01:35:40,861 --> 01:35:43,697
Since that night, I've never
said the name of a city.

2045
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:44,990
"Hello, you."

2046
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:46,741
I'm here
to keep you humble, baby.

2047
01:35:46,825 --> 01:35:48,368
Where's my lipstick bag?

2048
01:35:48,452 --> 01:35:50,579
- You have a lipstick bag?
- Yeah.

2049
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:52,122
Oh, my God, get out. Get out.

2050
01:35:52,205 --> 01:35:53,707
- Lipstick and perfume...
- Get out.

2051
01:35:53,790 --> 01:35:56,168
- You can't swim with lipstick.
- Why?

2052
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:58,170
You look so beautiful,

2053
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:00,464
it makes me want to punch you
in the left elbow.

2054
01:36:00,547 --> 01:36:02,757
I would like someone
to acknowledge

2055
01:36:02,841 --> 01:36:04,593
how well I'm handling this.

2056
01:36:08,305 --> 01:36:10,307
Bye, everybody.

2057
