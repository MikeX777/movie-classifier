Hello.

00:01:01,022 --> 00:01:02,499
Hello.

4
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,609
I'll have the same.

5
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:09,852
Ah, weddings!

11
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,539
But well done for trying.

12
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:31,051
I heard the new one legged it.

13
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,138
Michaela and I have
parted company, yes.

14
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:40,458
These young women, they just can't
make up their minds, can they?

00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:42,807
No.

16
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,178
You get me, Kate, though.
Or you used to.

17
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:49,899
That's because I'm a trained

19
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,097
Marvellous. I'm playing some

What?

21
00:01:56,018 --> 00:01:58,538
- You're going to be so bored.
- I will not be bored.

22
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:00,096
- Totally and utterly bored.
- Rubbish!

23
00:02:00,097 --> 00:02:02,369
- Bored.
- Rubbish.

24
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,656
- You look great, by the way.
- Oh, shut up.

25
00:02:05,657 --> 00:02:08,083
Damn it! Still handsome.

26
00:02:08,938 --> 00:02:10,577
- OK, so he's here.
- Who?

27
00:02:10,578 --> 00:02:11,889
- Ken.
- Oh!

29
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:16,097
- He's got a nice body.
- Ken?

31
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:19,776

more aggressively.

32
00:02:19,777 --> 00:02:20,976
Get out there.

33
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:22,056
I do get out there!

34
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:26,281
Taking your laptop out into the
garden is not getting out there.

35
00:02:29,137 --> 00:02:32,055
Come on, you two!
Get back together.

36
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:34,495
- Come on, get back together.
- Not now, Jerry.

37
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:37,175

00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:38,894

00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:43,215
Oh! Wh... whoosh!

41
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:45,175
- Ah... flowers!
- Yeah, they're for you.

42
00:02:45,176 --> 00:02:47,775
Oh, thank you.
They're... they're lovely.

43
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:51,443
- You're allergic.
- Only mildly.

44
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:54,054
Why is Kate holding flowers
when she's allergic?

45
00:02:54,055 --> 00:02:55,094
Only mildly.

46
00:02:55,095 --> 00:02:56,894
- I'm so sorry. I didn't know...
- No, no, no, it's fine.

47
00:02:56,895 --> 00:03:00,374
It's not all flowers. Really, I like them.
I want them. I actually want them.

48
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,493

She's allergic.

105
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,324

106

00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:27,562

- Ah, that's not bad.
- Nice one.

113
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,322
- Whoo-hoo!
- Sure we won't be bored now?

114
00:06:41,323 --> 00:06:46,320
Bored? Bored?
What, with all this? Bored!

115
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:47,873
As if.

116
00:06:49,162 --> 00:06:50,842
- Oh!
- Oh, no. It's not gone again, has it?

- Oh, yeah. Shit!
- Anything I can do?

118
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:57,281
Yeah, just... just put your...
put your thumb right there, mate.

119
00:06:57,282 --> 00:07:00,641
Oh, I'd better not stand
there. People will talk.

120
00:07:00,642 --> 00:07:03,640

wash your jeans inside out,

121
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:05,680
if it looks swollen,
it probably is, and...

122
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:08,361
and never put anything into your
mouth that hasn't been boiled first.

123
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:11,239
- Oh, it's Dad.
- Oh.

124
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,160
Hi, Dad.

125
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:13,840
Hello, my darling.
Have you left yet?

126
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:15,200
I'm just setting off. I'm with Mum.

127
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,560
'Lucky girl, going to Edinburgh.'

128
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:20,039
Your Mum and I were quite the
dynamic pair on campus in our day.

129
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,758
Maybe I'll buy a flat near you
and relive my student days.

130
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:25,839
- Er... no, thanks, Dad. It's my turn.
- 'Yes, it is indeed.'

131
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,879
Don't know where Jerry's going.
No, Jerry's getting lost.

132
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,519
'So what are you gonna
do now you're retired?'

133
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,159
'Oh, I don't know.'

134
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,159
Maybe I'll finally buy that boat and
sail around the world, you know.

135
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,347
- You were gonna do that with Mum.
- 'That's true, I was.'

136
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,078
Dad, I have to go. I've got
a big drive ahead of me.

137
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:42,558
OK. Call me when you get in, now.
I love you, Sophie.

138
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,870
'Love you too, Dad.'

139
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:47,198
- He's threatening to relive his student days.
- Mmm.

140
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:50,118
- What were you two like at college?
- Naive, unrealistic, ill-prepared.

141
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:52,278
So, everything that I am right now.

142
00:07:52,278 --> 00:07:53,677
Not you, not you, never you.

143
00:07:53,678 --> 00:07:56,678
Not at all. Come on, off you go.

144
00:07:56,679 --> 00:08:00,438
Don't forget to call me when you
get there. Always go out in groups.

145
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,997
If you get homesick, come home.
And try and find a good taxi service.

146
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:05,717
Because some of them
have women-only drivers.

147
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:09,069
Women-only drivers, got it.
Anything else?

148
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:13,507
Be yourself, you're lovely.

149
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:30,948
Oh!

150
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:44,515
Hi, honey, I'm home.

151
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:49,434
Hello, Rumps. Come here.

152
00:08:49,435 --> 00:08:53,154
Hello, darling.

153
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:55,435
What shall we do
this afternoon, eh?

154
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:58,460
Let's get drunk.

155
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:08,023
Hi, honey, I'm home.

156
00:09:23,474 --> 00:09:25,352
You can hide all you like.

157
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:29,314
I've spotted you and we should
get a start on your last week.

158
00:09:29,314 --> 00:09:31,153
Yes, of course.
Good morning, Doreen.

159
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:34,632
It has always been our good
fortune to share the same train.

160
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:37,232
No rest for the wicked, Mr Jones.

161
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:39,672
Doreen, after all these years, after
everything we've been through,

162
00:09:39,673 --> 00:09:41,312
are you still refusing
to call me Richard?

163
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:45,432
Yes! Now, you have a ten o'clock
meeting with the new owners.

164
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:47,471
- Yeah.
- Any idea who they are?

165
00:09:47,473 --> 00:09:48,696
Hmm...

166
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:51,992
Young is all I know, Doreen.

167
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:54,232
I took your advice on their
pension share offer.

168
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:56,270
- I took them up on it.
- What? The whole lot?

169
00:09:56,271 --> 00:10:00,431
Yes, lots of us did. Janice in
Accounts, Marcus in Payroll.

170
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:02,591
Well, it's a solid offer.

171
00:10:02,592 --> 00:10:06,380
Now, you have a prostate
check at 2:15 today.

172
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,462
I'm gonna miss these
little chats, Doreen.

173
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,349
I thought my leaving
party was on Friday.

174
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,870
I don't think this is
a party, Mr Jones.

175
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,940
- It's all gone, Richard. The lot!
- What?

176
00:10:25,671 --> 00:10:27,462
Morning, everyone.

177
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,548
Richard, what's going on?

178
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:38,309
I don't know, Janice.
I have no idea.

179
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,229
- Did you know about this?
- No, of course not, Marcus.

180
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,749
- Is this legal? Can they just do this?
- Yes, of course they can.

181
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,668
Now, wait a minute.
We don't know that.

182
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:46,749
Just... just give me
some time here, please.

183
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,468
- Will we get paid this month?
- Yes, of course you will.

184
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:50,868
- Did you know this was coming?
- Of course he didn't!

185
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:53,188
Someone said the shares are
worthless. Is that true?

186
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:54,893
- No.
- Yes.

187
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:01,189
Jesus!

188
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:06,268
I suppose they'll let us in at some point.
To collect our things, I mean.

189
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:09,817
Doreen, I promise you,
I will sort this out.

190
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:17,706
Everyone, listen up! I promise you
I'll get to the bottom of this.

191
00:11:17,707 --> 00:11:20,508
I will find out what's going on
but I just need some time, OK?

192
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:21,986
What are we supposed to do now?

193
00:11:21,987 --> 00:11:24,826
- How?
- But, Richard, what can you do?

194
00:11:24,827 --> 00:11:27,586
I... I don't know,
but I promise you,

195
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:31,265
I will make sure that every one
of you gets what they're due.

196
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:35,698
I will not, will not, let you down.

197
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:47,298
OK, Jean-Baptiste, here I come.

198
00:11:48,506 --> 00:11:52,465
I am interested in the, er...

199
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:56,690
the arts and culture.

200
00:11:56,987 --> 00:12:01,744
I love travel and adventure

201
00:12:01,745 --> 00:12:05,304
and generally being...

202
00:12:05,306 --> 00:12:10,503
spon-tan-eous.

203
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:12,055
Whoosh!

204
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,097
Oh, God!

205
00:12:17,865 --> 00:12:22,423
'Finally, after heavy bidding, a diamond
has been sold today at Sotheby's

206
00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:25,223
'for a record 10.8 million.'

207
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:26,143
Blimey!

208
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:30,423
'Known in the trade as the Eye of the Rainbow
because of its distinctive colouring in the light

Today's buyer wishes to remain anonymous.

'However, Sotheby's
says the buyer plans...

Oh, bloody hell!

217
00:12:49,063 --> 00:12:50,614
OK.

218
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,370
Ken, I'm coming for you.

219
00:12:56,702 --> 00:12:59,341
Oh, twice in one week. What
have I done to deserve this?

220
00:12:59,342 --> 00:13:01,421
- Kate, we need to talk.
- Not now, Richard. I'm busy.

221
00:13:01,422 --> 00:13:02,460
- Please, I just need to...
- Hello!

222
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:04,661
- Hello, Ken.
- Look, no flowers!

223
00:13:04,662 --> 00:13:06,289
Well done!

224
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:10,221
- Oh, it's you again.
- Ken. Again, hi.

225
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,740
Kate, I need to speak to you.

226
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:14,140
- I'll see you...
- Yes...

227
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:18,289
OK, great. Looking forward.

228
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:22,300
- Have you been drinking?
- No... Yes.

229
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,579
- Look, what difference does it make?
- A lot of difference.

230
00:13:24,581 --> 00:13:27,500
You're prone to exaggeration
and wild statements of intent.

231
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:29,420
Look, there are big
problems at the office.

232
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:32,780
Please, tell it to Anastasia or
Michaela or whoever the latest is...

233
00:13:32,781 --> 00:13:34,979
Culco has gone into receivership.

234
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,978
The new owners have stripped us of any
value and run us into the ground.

235
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:39,059
The shares are worthless.

236
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,618
My pension, your pension,
was all tied up in those shares.

237
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,578
The mortgage payments on my place,
this place, the kids' university fees,

238
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:47,767
everything we'd saved up for
them afterwards, it's all gone.

239
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,297
Kate, I virtually had the
whole company on board.

240
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:54,684
Marcus, Janice, I even
got Doreen involved.

241
00:13:57,299 --> 00:13:59,338
Come on.

242
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,618
What do we know about these guys?

243
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:03,736
Lavco. They came in hard
and fast out of nowhere.

244
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:06,018
The holding company traded
by the name of Lexon.

245
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:09,618
We were persuaded to integrate
our pension fund into theirs.

246
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:12,057
Turns out Lexon was hollow, toxic.

247
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,817
So when they turned to
dust, so did our pension.

248
00:14:15,817 --> 00:14:18,537
There's always someone
bigger behind these things,

249
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:21,617
someone who manages to wipe
their hands clean and move on.

250
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:27,656
- Still allergic to cat hair?
- Worse than ever.

251
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:30,125
Go on, Rumpy, sit on him.

252
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:32,176
- I see you got your PhD.
- Yeah.

253
00:14:32,177 --> 00:14:36,416
- So, how's life as a lecturer?
- Under-paid.

254
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,216
- What are the students like?
- Under-motivated.

255
00:14:39,217 --> 00:14:42,215
Could you just stop
fidgeting and sit down?

256
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:46,175
I'm on the site but I can't get any
real info. I'm being blocked.

257
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,416
We need a password.

258
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:50,695
- We need...
- Matt.

259
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:51,855
We need Matt.

260
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:53,735
'Mum, you do know
hacking is illegal.'

261
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:56,175
'I know, Matt and I would never
want you to do anything illegal.

262
00:14:56,176 --> 00:15:00,695
'But I wondered if you could just...
accidentally stumble into it.'

263
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:02,519
Accidentally stumble into it?

264
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:05,734
- 'Son, do as your mother asks.'
- Dad?

265
00:15:05,735 --> 00:15:08,414
- What are you doing there?
- 'It's a long story, Matty boy.

266
00:15:08,415 --> 00:15:11,335
'But right now it's payback time
on that misspent youth I funded.'

267
00:15:11,336 --> 00:15:12,654
- 'We funded.'
- OK, hold on.

268
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:16,279
I'll have to use my other
computer. Wait here.

269
00:15:20,534 --> 00:15:23,413
- Is that his roommate, Tyler?
- I think it is.

270
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:24,613
Oh, Tyler!

271
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:28,733
- 'Close the door.'
- 'Come on, son. Close it now.'

272
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:30,293
Mr and Mrs J?

273
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:32,853
'Yes, we're here on Skype.'

274
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:34,766
'Sorry.'

275
00:15:35,973 --> 00:15:39,085
'OK, I've emailed you the password.
That will get you in.'

276
00:15:39,732 --> 00:15:41,492
- 'Good man!'
- 'Well done, Matt.'

277
00:15:41,494 --> 00:15:44,245
Oh, and guys... it's really
good to see you together again.

278
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:50,291
- Oh!
- Hey!

279
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:51,613
- We're in.
- Good.

280
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:54,037
I've always wanted to say that.

281
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,732
There we go. Lexon.

282
00:15:56,734 --> 00:15:59,051
Owned by one Vincent
Mathias Kruger,

283
00:15:59,052 --> 00:16:02,291
international hedge fund
manager, born in Budapest,

284
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:06,890
currently resides in Paris, horribly young,
keen sportsman, patron of the arts.

285
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:08,611
Oh! Mentor to the young.

286
00:16:08,612 --> 00:16:12,410
Could he look any more like a money
grabbing, cheating, immoral little shit?

287
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:14,891
But you're not gonna get away with
it, my friend, not on my watch.

288
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:16,691
- He can't hear you.
- I know he can't hear me.

289
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:18,890
But he's certainly
gonna feel my wrath.

290
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:22,410
- OK, Guevara, what's your plan?
- I'm gonna go to Paris.

291
00:16:22,411 --> 00:16:24,571
I'm gonna go to Paris with
what little money I have left

292
00:16:24,572 --> 00:16:27,411
and bang on that man's door so loudly
he's gonna pay for me to go away.

293
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:29,009
I'm gonna get back
what's rightfully mine.

294
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,090
- Ours.
- Ours.

295
00:16:30,091 --> 00:16:33,569
I didn't work for 25 years in that
God-forsaken job to have some little...

296
00:16:33,571 --> 00:16:34,649
Prick?

297
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,248
prick like him stroll in and
spirit away my, our, retirement.

298
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:42,929
I'm gonna do it for all the little people
who've done nothing but play by the rules.

299
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,889
For Marcus and Janice,
for Doreen, for you.

300
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,848
No, do not do it for me.

301
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,958
For the kids.

302
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,922
- How's your French?
- Rusty. Why?

303
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,321
<i>Non.</i>

304
00:16:56,769 --> 00:17:00,874
<i>Non, non, non, non, non, non.</i>
Absolutely not. No way!

305
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:19,847
You missed it again!
I said the second exit.

306
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:21,008
I couldn't get across.

307
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:23,047
What do you mean, you couldn't
get across? Just indicate!

308
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:25,887
I am indicating, darling, but they're
not paying any bloody attention.

309
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:27,447
How can your driving
not have improved?

310
00:17:27,448 --> 00:17:31,167
You've had years to practise.
Be assertive, man!

311
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:32,806
Be assertive? Right.

312
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:45,446
- This is very unlike her.
- She might have got a better offer.

313
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:49,606
- A better offer than Ken?
- Our dog's a better offer than Ken.

314
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,325
- Let's just get something straight, shall we?
- Yes, let's.

315
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:02,725
- We go, we sort this mess out.
- Uh-huh.

316
00:18:02,726 --> 00:18:05,165
And then we go on with the
rest of our lives, separately.

317
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:07,273
Sounds good to me.

318
00:18:08,926 --> 00:18:11,645
Come on then, Trotsky.
Let's get this over with.

319
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:32,073
<i>Merci.</i>

320
00:18:33,123 --> 00:18:35,876
- Hmm... no dice.
- No.

321
00:18:36,764 --> 00:18:39,563
Do you remember that time
at Soph's PTA meeting

322
00:18:39,564 --> 00:18:41,867
when we couldn't get in
to see the headmaster?

323
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:44,512
- And you...?
- Yeah.

324
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:47,787
- Worth a try.
- Yeah.

325
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:54,082
Oh, sweetheart... Oh, damn!
Oh, dear, dear.

326
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,595
A glass of water, please.

327
00:19:02,162 --> 00:19:04,391
- Which floor?
- Top floor.

328
00:19:05,282 --> 00:19:08,761
- Not bad, Miss Jones. Not bad.
- You never lose skills like that.

329
00:19:08,762 --> 00:19:10,911
- Can you still do that thing with your...
- No, Richard.

330
00:19:16,602 --> 00:19:18,160
- Mr Kruger's office?
- <i>Oui.</i>

331
00:19:18,162 --> 00:19:20,390
<i>- Très bon.
- Quoi?</i>

332
00:19:24,082 --> 00:19:25,640
Mr Kruger, I'm sorry...

333
00:19:25,641 --> 00:19:27,959
It's OK. Can I help you?

334
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,880
You bought the company
I work for last week.

335
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,919
- Pardon?
- And ran it into the ground.

336
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,480
I don't understand, sir.

337
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,544
Vous <i>êtes un</i> money grabbing pig!

338
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,319
- Your company...
<i>- Votre... votre</i> company.

339
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,679
- ...bought my company...
- Hang on... <i>acheté ma</i>... company.

340
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,959
And ran it into the ground.

341
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,753
<i>Et le...</i>

342
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,425
Steady, Kate.

343
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,239
- Steady, Kate. Steady.
- Sorry.

344
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,478
I run a lot of companies into
the ground. Which one?

345
00:19:57,479 --> 00:20:01,118
- Culco.
- Culco, er...

346
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,157
See, that was last week. I very much
live in the now, the <i>maintenant.</i>

347
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:08,839
Well, maybe this is <i>maintenant</i> enough for you.
You stole all our money and we want it back.

348
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,518
- And you are?
- This is my wife.

349
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:11,598
- Ex-wife.
- Ex-wife.

350
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:13,477
- Ex-wife?
- Yeah, we've established that now.

351
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,438
- So you're not denying it.
- No, I don't think so.

352
00:20:15,438 --> 00:20:17,278
Listen, you, there are
people whose lives

353
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,077
depend on the pension
they were gonna receive.

354
00:20:19,078 --> 00:20:21,949
You can't just throw them away
like that. It's just not fair.

355
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:24,669
OK, OK, you got me.

356
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:28,557
What I did was wrong,
reprehensible, evil even.

357
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:33,116
In a normal world, illegal. But that's
the beauty of it: it's completely legal.

358
00:20:33,117 --> 00:20:35,077
Now, listen to me, you
little sack of shit.

359
00:20:35,078 --> 00:20:38,317
You are messing with people's lives.
Proper, good, hardworking people

360
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:39,676
who have done absolutely nothing

361
00:20:39,677 --> 00:20:41,635
but play by the bloody rules
laid out in front of them.

362
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:43,397
Oh, she definitely wears
the trousers, no?

363
00:20:43,398 --> 00:20:45,555
I'm not even gonna rise to that.
Of course she does.

364
00:20:45,556 --> 00:20:47,997
- We're the older generation. We're enlightened.
- We're divorced.

365
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:49,475
And we're done.

366
00:20:49,476 --> 00:20:53,077
Put me down. Put me down!
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

367
00:20:53,078 --> 00:20:56,916
Put me down. Put my wife down!
Put my wife down!

368
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:58,315
- There you go.
- Ex-wife.

369
00:20:58,316 --> 00:20:59,635
Ex-wife.

370
00:20:59,636 --> 00:21:00,954
- Could have had 'em.
- Shit!

371
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:03,075
We are totally taking
him down. Totally!

372
00:21:03,076 --> 00:21:05,064
Now what, huh?

373
00:21:16,555 --> 00:21:17,875
Whoo!

374
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:20,514
Close your mouth. Who do
you think she belongs to?

375
00:21:20,515 --> 00:21:24,782
If I were a betting man,
I'd say... Here you go.

376
00:21:27,315 --> 00:21:28,419
Bingo!

377
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:32,633
- Quick, let's follow.
- Good idea.

378
00:21:32,634 --> 00:21:35,512
- Let me drive. I'm the better driver.
- No way, José. You forgot your license.

379
00:21:35,514 --> 00:21:37,673
- Come on, Richard. I'm a much better driver.
- You forgot your license.

380
00:21:37,674 --> 00:21:38,994
You're not a better driver.
You just think you are.

381
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:39,993
You'll regret it.

382
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:42,673
- Remember Hammersmith bridge?
- That's unfair.

383
00:21:42,674 --> 00:21:46,393
You forgot to put oil in the tank.
You forgot to put oil in it.

384
00:21:46,394 --> 00:21:48,992
- Go fast. Go fast.
- I'm not gonna go fast.

385
00:21:48,993 --> 00:21:51,222
Quickly, they're getting away.

386
00:21:53,193 --> 00:21:55,952
- You've gotta keep up, Richard.
- It's called tailing, Kate.

387
00:21:55,953 --> 00:21:58,420
If we get too close, they'll
know they're being followed.

388
00:22:00,073 --> 00:22:01,632
Well, that was the world's
shortest car chase.

389
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:04,072
What? It's a red light! You want
me to start running reds now?

390
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,136
No, God forbid, Richard.

391
00:22:07,152 --> 00:22:08,660
Well, that was intense.

392
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,432
Thank you. Could have killed a nun.

393
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:14,261
Many nuns, possibly.
A whole load of dead nuns.

394
00:22:16,191 --> 00:22:17,671
- Oh, that's them, Richard!
- What?

395
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:19,551
I've just seen them, Richard!
Please, let me drive.

396
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:21,511
- Please! Please, let me drive.
- Fine.

397
00:22:21,512 --> 00:22:25,470
OK, OK. It's been a while.

398
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:27,390
What did you have for lunch?

399
00:22:27,391 --> 00:22:28,856
What?

400
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,310
Buckle up.

401
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:34,391
Which way are we going?
Kate, we're going backwards.

402
00:22:34,391 --> 00:22:36,070
- Yep.
- Backwards, Kate!

403
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:38,030
Putting my seat belt on.
Putting my seat belt on right now.

404
00:22:38,031 --> 00:22:42,103
Kate, no, no, no, no!
Kate! Kate! Kate! Kate!

405
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:44,989
- Argh!
- Hold tight.

406
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:49,268
I'm holding tight! We can't even
afford the basic insurance.

407
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,550
Oh, fuck the insurance.

408
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,868
Whoo-hoo!

409
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:58,709
Ha! We did it! There they are.

410

413
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:09,788

We're divorced. I kept his name.

- Yes.

462
00:25:32,102 --> 00:25:33,180
Yeah, you did, didn't you?

463
00:25:33,181 --> 00:25:35,780
Yes, because it's been mine for some
time. And my kids have it. It's no biggy.

464
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:41,779
And you are holidaying together to
see if perhaps the flame still burns?

465
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,499

- No, so not. The flame is out.

- Snuffed, gone.

467
00:25:46,661 --> 00:25:50,220
We are in Paris. You never know...

468
00:25:50,221 --> 00:25:52,252
We do know.

469
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:57,780
Ah, I'm afraid the only two rooms
I have left are adjoining.

470
00:25:57,781 --> 00:26:00,859
- What about those?
- Oh, no, they are all taken.

471
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,607

472
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,451
- Really?
- We'll take them. Thank you. Bonsoir.

Bonsoir.

474
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:12,898
Bloody hell. What floor?

475
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:15,530
- Haven't a clue.
- Christ!

476
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:20,297
You don't fancy rubbing some Deep
Heat into my coccyx, do you?

477
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:23,803
- No.
- Just a thought.

478
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:35,729
Ooh!

479
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:43,447
You'll never guess
where I find myself.

480
00:26:54,217 --> 00:26:57,765
<i>Pourquoi pas?</i>

481
00:27:00,297 --> 00:27:03,535
There's two bowls down for Rumpus
and the kitchen light is on.

482
00:27:03,536 --> 00:27:06,776
Sophie, darling! Hey,
got your leg over yet?

483
00:27:06,777 --> 00:27:08,495
Hello. Sophie, darling?

484
00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:10,856
You haven't heard from
you mother, have you?

485
00:27:10,856 --> 00:27:15,124
No, it's nothing to worry about. It's just
we were supposed to see her yesterday.

486
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:36,999
"Of all the gin joints, in all the towns,
in all the world, she walks into mine."

487
00:27:38,255 --> 00:27:41,322
What are the chances, eh?

488
00:27:47,095 --> 00:27:48,813
Steak-frites.
That's what you'll have.

489
00:27:48,814 --> 00:27:50,773
Nope. Turned veggie two years ago.

490
00:27:50,775 --> 00:27:52,574
But you love meat.

491
00:27:52,574 --> 00:27:55,573
People change, Richard. But you're
gonna have the cheese soufflé.

492
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:58,091
- Nope.
- But you love cheese.

493
00:27:58,093 --> 00:28:01,172
- Cholesterol levels change, Kate.
- How's your prostate?

494
00:28:01,173 --> 00:28:03,212
Fully functioning, thank you.
How are your bunions?

495
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,892
Oh, how sweet of you to remember.
Actually, they're awful.

496
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:08,852
High heels are no longer
an option. See?

497
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,637
Here's to our aging, ailing bodies.

498
00:28:13,813 --> 00:28:16,596
- May I?
- Yes, go on.

499
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:24,811
Ooh, ooh!

500
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:26,875
Hey! Hey, sweetie!

501
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:29,731
How's it going?

502
00:28:29,732 --> 00:28:31,611
Oh, I'm so glad.

503
00:28:31,611 --> 00:28:33,371
And you like the
people in your halls?

504
00:28:34,371 --> 00:28:36,211
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

505
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:41,730
All right, yes, you've got to go.
Of course you've got to go.

506
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:46,889
Call me... call me later.
Yes, I love you... Bye... bye.

507
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:52,129
- Rich, what could I say to her?
- It's all right. It's fine.

508
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,754
Oh!

509
00:28:57,091 --> 00:28:59,002
Hey, honey, how's it going?

510
00:28:59,449 --> 00:29:02,233
Yeah? For every party
write an essay.

511
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,958
All right, for every three
parties write an essay.

512
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:10,769
No. No, no, no. I'm so
proud of you, sweetheart.

513
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,689
Is that what Mum said?

514
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:15,529
Ah, well, great minds and all that.

515
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:18,957
Listen, do me a favour, next time
you speak to your Mum, tell her...

516
00:29:20,089 --> 00:29:22,249
Tell her I miss her.

517
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,488
OK.

518
00:29:23,489 --> 00:29:25,074
I love you.

519
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:27,767
Bye, darling.

520
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:30,247
- What's got into you?
- I don't know.

521
00:29:30,248 --> 00:29:34,287
Paris, retirement,
spending time with you,

522
00:29:34,288 --> 00:29:36,248
having our money stolen.

523
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:38,477
That'll do it.

524
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:44,367
This is nice, right?

525
00:29:44,368 --> 00:29:45,995
Yeah.

526
00:29:50,008 --> 00:29:51,486
Michaela, er...

527
00:29:51,487 --> 00:29:54,607
Just a sec... just one second.

528
00:29:54,608 --> 00:29:58,111
Listen, Michaela, I can't talk
right now. Please understand.

529
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:05,286
It's OK, I'm just tired.
I'm gonna eat in my room.

530
00:30:05,287 --> 00:30:06,630
Shit.

531
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,953
Guess who's getting married?

532
00:30:24,885 --> 00:30:28,044
Ah! "Vincent Kruger and
fiancée Manon Fontaine.

533
00:30:28,045 --> 00:30:31,284
"Spotted off the coast of Cannes
as they prepare for their big day.

534
00:30:31,285 --> 00:30:33,324
"The upcoming nuptials are
rumoured to be taking place...

535
00:30:33,324 --> 00:30:35,403
"at the Krugers'
19th-century château

536
00:30:35,404 --> 00:30:38,804
"located within the exclusive
enclave of Cap d'Antibes."

537
00:30:38,805 --> 00:30:40,644
We've got to get ourselves
invited to that wedding.

538
00:30:40,645 --> 00:30:43,243
Why? We hate weddings.
It's the only thing we agree on.

539
00:30:43,244 --> 00:30:44,829
Look at her neck.

540
00:30:45,645 --> 00:30:47,404
- Pretty.
- Mm-hmm. What's round it?

541
00:30:47,404 --> 00:30:51,163
- Nice.
- Mmm, nice in the region of 10 million.

542
00:30:51,164 --> 00:30:53,284
Oh, very nice.

543
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:55,243
I'm pretty sure...
in fact, I'm positive

544
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:56,884
that's the Eye of the Rainbow.

545
00:30:56,884 --> 00:30:59,643
- I thought I recognised it on her yesterday.
- Ah, the Eye of the Rainbow.

546
00:30:59,643 --> 00:31:03,283
Yes, that sold at Sotheby's recently,
fetching a record price for a single stone.

547
00:31:03,283 --> 00:31:05,362
When did you become such
a diamond aficionado?

548
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,082
Since the kids left home.
Daytime TV.

549
00:31:08,084 --> 00:31:10,714
It's a mine of useless information.

550
00:31:11,363 --> 00:31:13,962
- And, in this case, life-changing information.
- Indeed.

551
00:31:13,963 --> 00:31:17,921
I bet she's gonna be wearing
that rock at the wedding.

552
00:31:17,922 --> 00:31:23,314
That rock is our pension.
That rock is Doreen's pension.

553
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:30,230
We should nick it.

554
00:31:35,283 --> 00:31:36,361
What?

555
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:38,960
It's just taking back what he's
taken from us and all the others.

556
00:31:38,961 --> 00:31:39,920
You want to steal a diamond?

557
00:31:39,921 --> 00:31:41,440
Richard, he's not gonna
give us our money back.

558
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,241
Well, that doesn't mean we
suddenly become the Pink Panther.

559
00:31:43,242 --> 00:31:46,360
Why not? Richard, we are screwed.

560
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:48,120
We have nothing, literally nothing.

561
00:31:48,121 --> 00:31:50,400
Nothing to give the kids. It's
time to take back what's ours.

562
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:56,120
I'm sick of these fat, greedy, fucker billionaires
taking all our money, just ruining this country.

563
00:31:56,121 --> 00:31:59,718
Well, not this country, actually, because
France has got great social services

564
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:01,280
and, my word, do they
run a good protest.

565
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,959
It's a stupid idea, Kate.

566
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,199
- Crazy, daft...
- All right, all right.

567
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,547
stupid but brilliant.

568
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,358
- Brilliant idea.
- Yeah?

569
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:15,547
Why the hell not? If not now,
when? What have we got to lose?

570
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:20,038
- Apart from our dignity and our freedom.
- Exactly.

571
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:23,998
- Either way, it's worth investigating.
- Definitely. Let's investigate.

572
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:26,279
Well, it looks like we're
heading to the south of France.

573
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,024
Ah, together! What a good idea.

574
00:32:31,598 --> 00:32:33,718
Delightful. Isn't she beautiful?

575
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,786
- She is.
- Shut up.

576
00:32:49,597 --> 00:32:51,637
Yes, yes. Yes, I understand.

577
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:54,477
What do you mean,
they won't take it?

578
00:32:54,477 --> 00:32:56,541
Cut it up?

579
00:32:57,637 --> 00:33:02,625
Well, that's end of the credit
cards. Gone, kaput.

580
00:33:02,758 --> 00:33:06,229
- Who are you texting? You're like a teenager.
- No one.

581
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,835
- She's gorgeous.
- Not my type.

582
00:33:09,836 --> 00:33:13,235
Oh, right, yeah. Legs up to the
ceiling and arse as tight as a plum.

583
00:33:13,236 --> 00:33:14,555
Of course she isn't.

584
00:33:14,556 --> 00:33:20,635
Once maybe, but not anymore.
I like things a bit more... homely.

585
00:33:20,636 --> 00:33:25,186
If that was an attempt to flatter
me, you can piss right off.

586
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:28,755
Look, the legs aren't nearly
as good in real life.

587
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,715
They've clearly been airbrushed.

588
00:33:31,715 --> 00:33:33,514
- Steady. Handbrake off.
- I've got it.

589
00:33:33,515 --> 00:33:34,674
It's off.

590
00:33:34,674 --> 00:33:37,754
You've got it now.
OK. Where's she going?

591
00:33:37,755 --> 00:33:39,698
Just try and look like a tourist.

592
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:02,820
- Check it out?
- Yeah.

593
00:34:08,352 --> 00:34:10,100
Blimey!

594
00:34:13,473 --> 00:34:14,872
You should go in there.

595
00:34:14,873 --> 00:34:16,632
- Go and check the place out.
- I can't go in there.

596
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:18,140
Go on, go on.

597
00:34:44,512 --> 00:34:46,379
Julie.

598
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,382
Laura.

599
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:51,630
And who are you?

600
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:55,870
Oh, <i>moi</i>? Er... me,
I'm Miriam from... Weymouth.

601
00:34:55,871 --> 00:34:59,390
I'm your cousin...
well, second cousin,

602
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:03,748
twice removed, on your husband's
side, future husband.

603
00:35:03,749 --> 00:35:06,350
All right. You're with them.

Ah, it's going to be
the best wedding ever.

622
00:36:02,347 --> 00:36:04,859
Ah, the champion!

623
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:09,185
Could I have a Martini, please?
A really big one. Thank you.

624
00:36:09,186 --> 00:36:12,146
No, I don't know. I think I'm
making a terrible mistake.

625
00:36:12,147 --> 00:36:13,865
- No!
- You're not, sweetie.

626
00:36:13,866 --> 00:36:17,346
He's only using our wedding
as a business meeting.

627
00:36:17,347 --> 00:36:20,346
He's got two Texans and
their wives coming.

628
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:24,186
We've never met them before and he
wants me to make sure they are OK.

629
00:36:24,187 --> 00:36:25,744
Well, that's not right.

630
00:36:25,745 --> 00:36:27,785
And he's putting them
up at The Carlton.

631
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,785
Lovely! The Carlton!

632
00:36:29,786 --> 00:36:31,704
Hey, what do you think?

633
00:36:31,705 --> 00:36:34,697
You're old. You must
have been married once.

634
00:36:35,065 --> 00:36:38,330
Er... yes. Merci.

635
00:36:41,025 --> 00:36:45,009
Old, old me. Er... what do I think?

636
00:36:46,025 --> 00:36:47,744
Er...

637
00:36:47,745 --> 00:36:53,814
I think that liking them is much more
important than loving them, actually.

638
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:58,344
Love is easy to fall into.
Liking is much harder.

639
00:36:58,345 --> 00:37:00,823
Think of your wedding
as a driving test.

640
00:37:00,824 --> 00:37:04,896
You take it, you pass, and then you
really start to learn how to drive.

641
00:37:10,384 --> 00:37:12,175
Or you crash.

642
00:37:12,743 --> 00:37:15,182
What about that diamond he
bought you? You like that.

643
00:37:15,183 --> 00:37:18,131
- Yeah!
- Are you going to wear it at the wedding?

644
00:37:18,823 --> 00:37:20,222
Not for the ceremony.

645
00:37:20,222 --> 00:37:23,094
I'll change halfway through
the party and put it on then.

646
00:37:24,063 --> 00:37:26,621
Hey, come on, girls, let's para!

647
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:39,250
I like you. You're honest.
I don't have girlfriends like that.

648
00:37:41,181 --> 00:37:42,741
Good.

649
00:37:42,742 --> 00:37:45,661
So come on, come with me.
This is so much fun!

♪ Love me, oh-oh-oh,
just love me...

651
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:50,660

00:37:50,661 --> 00:37:54,900
♪ Just hold me, oh-oh-oh,
just kiss me, oh-oh-oh

653
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:57,444
♪ Just want me, L-O-V-E ♪

654
00:37:57,701 --> 00:38:01,686
So shoot me. I nodded off.
It happens at my age.

655
00:38:01,701 --> 00:38:03,259
And you were snoring.

656
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,940
Another unfortunate effect of age.

657
00:38:04,941 --> 00:38:07,379
Look, can we just stop niggling
and tell me what you found out?

658
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,100
I found out that I
chafe very easily.

659
00:38:10,101 --> 00:38:12,420
- Oh, my poor girl. I'm so sorry.
- Get off.

660
00:38:12,421 --> 00:38:14,938
And the Wedding's
obviously invite only.

661
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:16,979
But she is definitely gonna
be wearing the diamond.

662
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,219
She's gonna change halfway
through the evening.

663
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,978
That sounds good. Anything else?

664
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:23,779
Not really, just that she's
pissed off with the evil one

665
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,218
for inviting a couple of Texan
businessmen they've never met before.

666
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:28,378
Of course she's pissed off. She'll
end up looking after their wives.

667
00:38:28,379 --> 00:38:30,137
And she's right, it's
bang out of order.

668
00:38:30,138 --> 00:38:33,371
She didn't happen to mention
where they might be staying?

669
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:35,179
'So what are we
stumbling into today?'

670
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,858
The Carlton Hotel, Cannes.
Their guest list.

671
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:41,098
We're looking for four guests
with home addresses in Texas.

672
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:42,258
'Dad, that is so illegal.'

673
00:38:42,259 --> 00:38:45,618
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, son.
I wouldn't ask unless it was really...

674
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:48,417
'Dad, I'm only kidding. We do
that sort of shit all the time,

675
00:38:48,418 --> 00:38:51,338
'messing with people's reservations,
putting people in the same room.'

676
00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:53,257
- Not good, Matt.
- No, no.

677
00:38:53,258 --> 00:38:55,049
'Hold on.'

678
00:38:55,578 --> 00:39:00,086
- Do you think his eyes looked a bit red-rimmed?
- Just a little.

679
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,969
- Oh, he's not, is he?
- Yep.

680
00:39:09,257 --> 00:39:10,496
- Tyler!
- Tyer! Oi!

681
00:39:10,497 --> 00:39:12,576
Tyler! Tyler! Hello!

682
00:39:12,576 --> 00:39:13,896
- 'Hello.'
- 'Hello.'

683
00:39:13,897 --> 00:39:16,856
You've got to be kidding me!
You guys, again.

684
00:39:16,857 --> 00:39:19,521
Nice to see you, Tyler.

685
00:39:19,697 --> 00:39:24,456
'OK, we've got one Mr and Mrs
Hicks of Houston, Texas.

686
00:39:24,457 --> 00:39:26,336
'They're assigned
to the Monet suite.

687
00:39:26,337 --> 00:39:29,688
'And one Mr and Mrs Baxter. They're
across the hall in the Manet suite.

688
00:39:29,936 --> 00:39:33,894
'Anyway, guys, I've got to go.
But the south of France?

689
00:39:33,895 --> 00:39:36,056
'I am loving my new glam parents.

690
00:39:36,057 --> 00:39:37,519
'See you later.'

691
00:39:40,816 --> 00:39:43,415
- OK, so let me just get this straight.
- Hmm.

692
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:46,734
We are going to kidnap four
Texans, pretend to be them,

693
00:39:46,734 --> 00:39:48,613
go to a wedding in a château,

694
00:39:48,614 --> 00:39:51,694
somehow swap out the necklace,
and make our escape?

695
00:39:51,695 --> 00:39:53,974
I know, it sounds absurd.

696
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:58,733
- Absurd, yes. Crazy, daft, stupid.
- All right, all right.

697
00:39:58,734 --> 00:40:01,213
But brilliant.

698
00:40:01,214 --> 00:40:02,774
- Yeah?
- One small problem.

699
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,453
There are four Texans
and we are but two.

700
00:40:05,454 --> 00:40:07,245
Ah.

701
00:40:14,013 --> 00:40:17,252

- Hello, old son!
- Welcome, welcome.

717
00:40:57,851 --> 00:40:59,490
- Good to see you, mate!
- Good to see you.

718
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:02,850
I cannot tell you how happy we
are to see you back together.

719
00:41:02,851 --> 00:41:04,609
- Well, Pen...
- Yeah, it's great, isn't it?

720
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:06,970
And I don't mind telling you, it's
been an absolute nightmare for us,

721
00:41:06,971 --> 00:41:08,329
having to choose between you.

722
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,890
Damn shame, the whole
bloody business.

723
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:12,597
Anyway, thrilled to be here,
glad to help. What are we doing?

724
00:41:12,611 --> 00:41:13,690
Well...

725
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:23,158
- Kidnap? Stealing a diamond?
- Gatecrashing a wedding?

726
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:26,208
- Can we have... a moment?
- It's a lot to take in.

727
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:29,441
Talk about it. Go ahead.
I've got your bag.

728
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:32,997
What do you think?

729
00:41:33,089 --> 00:41:35,437
- He's in. She's not.
- Probably.

730
00:41:37,129 --> 00:41:40,008
Well... all right, we're in.

731
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:42,956
- Spot of lunch first?
- Yes!

732
00:41:55,327 --> 00:41:58,327
Right. Everyone clear on the plan?

733
00:41:58,328 --> 00:42:01,407
I tell you, I haven't been
this pumped since Shanghai.

734
00:42:01,408 --> 00:42:02,326
Shanghai?

735
00:42:02,327 --> 00:42:04,007
Yeah, you know, when I was
in the Merchant Navy?

736
00:42:04,008 --> 00:42:05,926
- Merchant Navy?
- Woman in every port, eh, Jerry?

737
00:42:05,927 --> 00:42:09,406
That sort of thing, yeah. It's
only a bit of boys' banter, Pen.

738
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:11,327
Pen, are you sure
these are gonna work?

739
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,046
Yes, three of those and
they'll be out like a baby.

740
00:42:13,047 --> 00:42:14,765
- Five minutes tops.
- I can vouch for that.

741
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:17,566
- Who prescribes them for you?
- That lovely young Dr Jenkins.

742
00:42:17,567 --> 00:42:19,126
Oh, yes. I've heard he's lovely.

743
00:42:19,127 --> 00:42:22,325
Yes, terribly helpful.
And the warmest hands.

744
00:42:22,326 --> 00:42:24,045
Excuse me?

745
00:42:24,046 --> 00:42:25,845
How will we know who they are?

746
00:42:26,926 --> 00:42:28,326
Well, I think we'll know.

747
00:42:28,327 --> 00:42:30,125
Let's do this.

748
00:42:42,006 --> 00:42:45,164

00:42:54,085 --> 00:42:56,836
Actually, I might go as well.

752
00:42:57,724 --> 00:43:00,004
You know what?
I need one too, actually.

753
00:43:00,005 --> 00:43:02,669
Well, it's never good to ignore it.

754
00:43:14,804 --> 00:43:16,123
♪ Breakin' rocks...

00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:17,363

00:44:08,841 --> 00:44:11,040
Oh, God, I hope we didn't
tie their hands too tightly.

769
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:12,439
Oh, do you think?

770
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,760
That was insane. I haven't had
this much fun since I was in Guam.

771
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:17,680
Guam?

772
00:44:17,681 --> 00:44:19,760
I was stationed there
during my military service.

773
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,600
Oh, God!

774
00:44:21,601 --> 00:44:23,039
Jerry! That's stealing!

775
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,239
Pen, Pen, Pen. This is real.
This is happening.

776
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,668
We either step up
or we get crushed.

777
00:44:29,879 --> 00:44:31,758
- Silly man. Stop showing off.
- Right.

778
00:44:31,759 --> 00:44:35,317
Let's pick up the replica necklace, back
to the hotel, cocktails and supper.

779
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:38,387
Yee-ha! Ride 'em, cowboy.

780
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:42,559
Jerry, how on earth did you
know where to find someone

781
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,439
who could make a replica necklace?

782
00:44:44,439 --> 00:44:46,679
Well, you know...
I have my contacts.

783
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,878
Contacts? No, Jerry we don't.

784
00:44:48,879 --> 00:44:53,158
Well, if you must know, I once had
a brief, er... affair of the heart

785
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:54,717
with a young jewellery designer.

786
00:44:54,718 --> 00:44:58,597
Affair of the heart with a
young jewellery designer!

787
00:44:58,598 --> 00:44:59,998
Calm down, Pen. It's all right.

788
00:44:59,999 --> 00:45:02,569
Yeah, don't worry, Pen. It's all
in the past, all forgotten.

789
00:45:03,038 --> 00:45:05,356
This is the basic
layout of the château.

790
00:45:05,357 --> 00:45:07,397
Do you know where all
the guards might be?

791
00:45:07,398 --> 00:45:09,875
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely, yes.

792
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:11,917
- No Jerry?
- No.

793
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,437
Rushed off while I
was having a bath.

794
00:45:13,438 --> 00:45:17,277
Said he had to meet a man about
something. Very odd, the whole thing.

795
00:45:17,277 --> 00:45:19,515
Anyway, don't let him spoil this.

796
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:22,077
This is lovely, seeing the two
of you being back together.

797
00:45:22,078 --> 00:45:25,581
Sorry, everyone. Got held up.
Quick little mission.

798
00:45:25,918 --> 00:45:29,315
I was just saying this is lovely and it's
lovely to see our friends back together.

799
00:45:29,316 --> 00:45:32,035
- Pen, can we get back to the plan?
<i>- Absolument. Pardon.</i>

800
00:45:32,036 --> 00:45:34,715
Now, this is where the guests
will be making their entrance.

801
00:45:34,717 --> 00:45:36,835
And we will be required to
show our invitations here.

802
00:45:36,836 --> 00:45:39,355
Now, you are going to be the
Baxters and we will be the Hicks.

803
00:45:39,356 --> 00:45:42,195
- And actually, Matt... Cheers.
- Cheers, everyone.

804
00:45:42,196 --> 00:45:44,354
Matt has done some
research into each couple.

805
00:45:44,356 --> 00:45:45,915
- Hey! Your Matt?
- Our Matt.

806
00:45:45,916 --> 00:45:47,915
- Such a bright boy.
- Thank you.

807
00:45:47,916 --> 00:45:49,715
Not like our Tim, is he?

808
00:45:49,716 --> 00:45:51,594
- That's disloyal, Jerry.
- Well, I was just being honest.

809
00:45:51,595 --> 00:45:54,594
He's an academic disaster zone,
isn't he? Police tape all around him.

810
00:45:54,595 --> 00:45:55,873
Jerry!

811
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:58,954
Now, we know that the bride will retire to
her bedroom at some point during the night

812
00:45:58,955 --> 00:46:01,593
to change her frock and the new frock
will be accompanied by the diamond.

813
00:46:01,594 --> 00:46:04,834
Now, hopefully, Richard and I will
have gained access through here.

814
00:46:04,835 --> 00:46:08,312
We'll attempt to swap out the diamond,
delivering the real one into your arms, Jerry.

815
00:46:08,314 --> 00:46:11,154
Now, you two will leave the party
early and if anything happens to us,

816
00:46:11,154 --> 00:46:13,153
if we get caught, we're
just a disgruntled employee

817
00:46:13,154 --> 00:46:14,393
and his pushy ex-wife

818
00:46:14,393 --> 00:46:16,353
who've had their pensions
stolen and won't go away.

819
00:46:16,354 --> 00:46:19,912
They'll find nothing on
us and they'll let us go.

820
00:46:19,913 --> 00:46:21,553
- Right.
- Or they'll kill us.

821
00:46:21,554 --> 00:46:23,313
Chop us up and throw us in the Med.

822
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:24,952
- Oh, God.
- Richard!

823
00:46:24,954 --> 00:46:28,064
It's out there. It's a possibility.

824
00:46:30,314 --> 00:46:33,832
Jerry, why do you keep winking at
Richard and patting your pocket?

825
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:36,312
What? What are you talking about?
Nothing. I'm not doing anything.

826
00:46:36,313 --> 00:46:37,792
I know when you're lying.

827
00:46:37,793 --> 00:46:39,912
Get off me, woman. Whey-hey!
What are you doing, woman?

828
00:46:39,913 --> 00:46:42,784
- Hey! Ho-ho!
- God, he's got a gun!

829
00:46:43,353 --> 00:46:44,431
What?

830
00:46:44,432 --> 00:46:46,552
Don't advertise it to the
whole flipping restaurant!

831
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,831
Why have you got a gun and why
have you brought it to dinner?

832
00:46:48,832 --> 00:46:50,471
- Are you crazy?
- Crazy? Me?

833
00:46:50,472 --> 00:46:54,312
- Kate, Richard, talk to him.
- Jerry, actually, why have you got a gun?

834
00:46:54,313 --> 00:46:58,190
It's a replica. Calm down. We just
thought it was a good idea, that's all.

835
00:46:58,191 --> 00:46:59,991
It's a real one, actually. They
didn't have any replicas left.

836
00:46:59,993 --> 00:47:03,190
- Bloody hell.
- We? So you're behind this brilliant plan?

837
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:05,311
Richard, have you led Jerry astray?

838
00:47:05,311 --> 00:47:08,310
- What? No! It was his idea.
- Led me astray? I'm not a flipping child.

839
00:47:08,311 --> 00:47:09,669
They were my contacts.

840
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:12,871
Jerry, where did you get this?
I demand to know!

841
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:16,950
Well, it's someone I
knew a long time ago.

842
00:47:16,951 --> 00:47:19,670
I was passing through
France on my way to Guam.

843
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:22,509
How come I don't know anything about this?
I've been married to you for 35 years, Jerry.

844
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,869
- You've completely spoiled the whole evening.
- All right, love.

845
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:27,021
- Have some more wine.
- Just have a bit more wine.

846
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:30,028
Let's at least see it, then.

847
00:47:30,029 --> 00:47:31,828
- Yeah, let's have a look.
- See what?

848
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:34,349
- The gun, Jerry.
- What? You want to see it?

849
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:36,709
- I do, actually.
- Let's have a look. Come on.

850
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:38,629
- Come on, then.
- All right.

851
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:41,508
- All right.
- Nobody's watching.

852
00:47:41,509 --> 00:47:44,533
Hey-hey! Have a look at that.
All right, all right. One at a time!

853
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:48,537
Whoops, sorry.

854
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,653
Oh!

855
00:47:55,629 --> 00:47:57,907
Freeze, you melon farmers.

856
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,667
- Steady, Pen.
- Oh, sorry.

857
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:00,747
Put it down.

858
00:48:01,747 --> 00:48:02,972
Jesus Christ!

859
00:48:04,668 --> 00:48:06,147
All right, er...

860
00:48:06,148 --> 00:48:08,108
- Out the door. Shall we?
- Yeah. Drink up.

861
00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:09,666
The bill, please.

862
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:11,547
Well, that was
something, wasn't it?

863
00:48:11,548 --> 00:48:13,587
- Do you'll think we'll get arrested?
- No.

864
00:48:13,588 --> 00:48:15,145
Oi, chaps, chaps. Good news.

865
00:48:15,146 --> 00:48:18,066
I've just been talking to the owner.
Turns out we were in the Legion together.

866
00:48:18,067 --> 00:48:20,547
He says if we, er... pay for
the wine, everything's OK.

867
00:48:20,548 --> 00:48:22,506
- Fantastic.
- Oh, fabulous.

868
00:48:22,508 --> 00:48:26,466
- I feel a bit giddy, Jerry.
- Oh, I say! You all right there, Pen?

869
00:48:26,467 --> 00:48:28,666
- Bedtime for us all.
- Right-o.

870
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:30,370
- Good night, then.
- Good night.

871
00:48:32,346 --> 00:48:36,425
- What are you doing?
- Well... they seem so happy.

872
00:48:36,426 --> 00:48:39,305
You know, with the idea of us.

873
00:48:39,306 --> 00:48:41,865
I don't want to spoil it
for them, that's all.

874
00:48:41,867 --> 00:48:45,145
Just... oh... just...

875
00:48:45,146 --> 00:48:46,745
Just...

876
00:48:46,746 --> 00:48:49,584
Oh... Oh!

877
00:48:49,585 --> 00:48:51,933
Oh, that feels good.

878
00:48:53,826 --> 00:48:56,893
Do you think we're
doing the right thing?

879
00:48:57,506 --> 00:49:01,625
You know, diamond
stealing and kidnapping.

880
00:49:01,626 --> 00:49:04,454
Without a shadow of a doubt.

881
00:49:06,225 --> 00:49:08,496
Sit down for a minute.

882
00:49:17,144 --> 00:49:19,414
I said sit.

883
00:49:21,985 --> 00:49:24,376
Lying down is fine too.

884
00:49:24,944 --> 00:49:27,663
Pen and I had a gin, doubles.

885
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:30,942
I just can't take it. I can't take my
booze anymore. That's the thing.

886
00:49:30,943 --> 00:49:35,016
Well... it just whips my arse.

887
00:49:35,143 --> 00:49:37,902
You're much more likeable
these days, you know?

888
00:49:37,903 --> 00:49:40,654
That's nice. Thanks.

889
00:49:41,903 --> 00:49:44,011
So are you.

890
00:49:44,783 --> 00:49:47,850
We were much too young when we met.

891
00:49:49,463 --> 00:49:52,530
We should have met now instead.

892
00:49:54,861 --> 00:49:57,930
I don't think it works like that.

893
00:49:59,902 --> 00:50:01,694
Why not?

894
00:50:06,022 --> 00:50:10,289
Why did the latest one leave you?

895
00:50:13,901 --> 00:50:15,845
She didn't, actually.

896
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:19,331
I left her.

897
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:24,491
Hmm.

898
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,539
- How's your back?
- Terrible.

899
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,965
How's your bunions?

900
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,725
Oh, excruciating.

901
00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:37,724
Sweet dreams.

902
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,447
Night-night.

903
00:50:42,659 --> 00:50:44,451
Oh.

904
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:49,297
- Oh, God! We didn't, did we?
- No.

905
00:50:49,298 --> 00:50:52,366
Oh! Thank God.

906
00:50:52,858 --> 00:50:54,899
You don't have to sound
so relieved about it.

907
00:50:59,819 --> 00:51:01,378
Oh.

908
00:51:02,938 --> 00:51:06,443
I haven't had sex for two years.
I'd like to have remembered it.

909
00:51:10,338 --> 00:51:14,017
Jerry, try this. Please,
cos it's so juicy. Go on.

910
00:51:14,017 --> 00:51:16,057
See what I mean? Gorgeous.

911
00:51:16,058 --> 00:51:17,937
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Here he is.

912
00:51:17,938 --> 00:51:19,096
- Hello.
- The stallion.

913
00:51:19,097 --> 00:51:21,577
Didn't get much sleep last
night, old son, did you?

914
00:51:21,577 --> 00:51:24,497
- Oh, Jerry.
- Oh, the old bed did shake, eh?

915
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,176
- Only my snoring, Jerry. That's all it was.
- Right you are.

916
00:51:27,177 --> 00:51:30,097
Looks like we've got a bit of a problem.
Matt did some digging around last night.

917
00:51:30,097 --> 00:51:32,495
Apparently there are going
to be fingerprint sensors

918
00:51:32,496 --> 00:51:33,656
at the entrance to the party.

919
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:36,095
Everyone's going to be scanned
before they're allowed in.

920
00:51:36,097 --> 00:51:38,575
- It's worse than Fort Knox.
- Mm-hmm.

921
00:51:38,576 --> 00:51:42,168
We could shave off their fingertips
and stick them onto ours.

922
00:51:42,776 --> 00:51:45,175
The Texans, I mean.
I saw it in a film once.

923
00:51:45,176 --> 00:51:47,215
- Pen...
- Oh, sorry.

924
00:51:47,215 --> 00:51:49,735
- I do get carried away.
- Good to think outside the box.

925
00:51:49,736 --> 00:51:51,815
We should go with something a
bit more mainstream, though.

926
00:51:51,815 --> 00:51:53,375
- Can everyone swim?
- Yes.

927
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:55,655
- How about climbing?
- Have you ever climbed, Jerry?

928
00:51:55,656 --> 00:51:56,974
- He has not.
- Yeah, I have.

929
00:51:56,975 --> 00:51:58,414
- I have.
- Jerry! When?

930
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:01,775
- When?
- I was in the Australian Parachute Regiment.

931
00:52:06,615 --> 00:52:08,013
7:28.

932
00:52:08,014 --> 00:52:09,654
- 7:32.
- 7:32.

933
00:52:09,655 --> 00:52:10,813
6:30.

934
00:52:10,814 --> 00:52:13,334
- Jerry, you're still on English time.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

935
00:52:13,335 --> 00:52:15,333

decided it was too dangerous.

Of course, this is not
really a wedding.

- I think that went quite well.
- For now.

996
00:56:23,641 --> 00:56:26,000
Let's blend in.

997
00:56:26,001 --> 00:56:29,399
Darling, I need to powder my nose. Would
you be so kind as to accompany me?

998
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,440
- It would be my pleasure.
- Thank you.

999
00:56:31,441 --> 00:56:33,320
- Ey-up.
- Jerry!

1000
00:56:33,321 --> 00:56:37,399
Merci. Well, Kate said
to blend in, didn't she?

1001
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,032
- Here's to us.
- Yeah.

1002
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,879
- Which floor?
- Second floor.

1003
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,672
Right.

1004
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:51,911
Right.

1005
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:56,308
Back in a tick.

1006
00:57:22,317 --> 00:57:28,103
That's it, that's her room.
OK, Jerry. 30 seconds.

1007
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:31,917
Howdy, partner! How ya doin' there?

1008
00:57:31,918 --> 00:57:34,955
- Come on.
- I'm looking for the old John Wayne.

1009
00:57:34,956 --> 00:57:40,516
The, er... pissoir, the,
er... bog crapper? Any idea?

1010
00:57:40,517 --> 00:57:43,268
Sorry, sir, downstairs.
This floor is private.

1011
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:51,636
Her window's open and there's
a ledge running to it.

1012
00:57:51,637 --> 00:57:53,194
A ledge? Ledge?

1013
00:57:53,195 --> 00:57:56,263
More like a balcony. Hold those.

1014
00:58:09,276 --> 00:58:11,699
- Slow, slow, slow.
- I am going slow.

1015
00:58:13,075 --> 00:58:15,433
- Don't look down.
- I'm not bloody looking down.

1016
00:58:15,434 --> 00:58:17,782
Oh... Oh!

1017
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:20,914
Turn around, turn around.

1018
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:25,754
See? Turn around. There you go.
That's it. You're all right now.

1019
00:58:25,755 --> 00:58:29,106
This is good. I got it.

1020
00:58:31,114 --> 00:58:32,832
Well done. Well done.

1021
00:58:32,833 --> 00:58:36,545
You're being very brave.
You're being very, very brave.

1022
00:58:37,353 --> 00:58:39,461
- Oh!
- Oh!

1023
00:58:40,353 --> 00:58:41,873
Oh, fuck!

1024
00:58:41,874 --> 00:58:43,032
Wait, wait, wait.

1025
00:58:43,033 --> 00:58:45,381
I've got you. I've got you.

1026
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:50,822
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1027
00:59:06,071 --> 00:59:09,063
- Cats.
- And flowers.

1028
00:59:24,192 --> 00:59:26,703
The 19th century.

1029
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:31,029
I'm gonna get changed.

1030
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:32,735
<i>Excusez-moi.</i>

1031
00:59:35,951 --> 00:59:38,014
Go with her.

1032
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:08,660
Ssh...

1033
01:00:20,108 --> 01:00:21,826
I'm coming.

1034
01:00:23,747 --> 01:00:26,979
Come in! <i>Entrez!</i>

1035
01:00:46,467 --> 01:00:48,186
What?

1036
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:50,624
- You want to watch me get dressed now?
- Eh?

1037
01:00:50,626 --> 01:00:52,897
Get out! Get out!

1038
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:05,089
She just... OK.

1039
01:01:09,145 --> 01:01:10,848
Ssh!

1040
01:01:12,985 --> 01:01:16,024
Oh, sorry. You're probably
wondering what I am doing.

1041
01:01:16,024 --> 01:01:19,105
- It's not...
- I'm so glad you're here.

1042
01:01:19,106 --> 01:01:20,383
Oh, there, there.

1043
01:01:20,384 --> 01:01:25,263
Now, just sit down and tell Auntie...
Miriam all your worries.

1044
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:26,824
What's the matter?

1045
01:01:26,825 --> 01:01:29,863
I've made a terrible mistake.

1046
01:01:29,864 --> 01:01:33,464
He does not love me.
He never has and he never will.

1047
01:01:33,465 --> 01:01:36,023
I've sold myself to the devil.

1048
01:01:36,023 --> 01:01:40,103
- I'm a whore. I'm a devil's whore.
- No, no, you're not.

1049
01:01:40,104 --> 01:01:42,983
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

1050
01:01:42,984 --> 01:01:45,342
No, no, no, you're not.
Of course you're not.

1051
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:50,422
Yes, I am. I'm a terrible,
horrible, shallow person.

1052
01:01:50,423 --> 01:01:52,941
I am a fake. I am a fake.

1053
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:56,262
I am a fake. I am a fake.

1054
01:01:56,263 --> 01:01:57,701
No, don't say that about yourself.

1055
01:01:57,702 --> 01:02:03,142
From what I can tell, you're a highly original,
slightly highly strung, bright, imaginative girl.

1056
01:02:03,143 --> 01:02:04,541
- Really?
- Yes.

1057
01:02:04,541 --> 01:02:06,901
- You really think so?
- I do. I do. Really.

1058
01:02:06,902 --> 01:02:10,022
That is the nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

1059
01:02:10,023 --> 01:02:14,140
Oh, no! Oh, thank you.
Thank you, you're so nice.

1060
01:02:14,141 --> 01:02:15,890
No, I'm not, really.

1061
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:25,061
Please excuse me.
I'll be right back. Sorry.

1062
01:02:25,062 --> 01:02:27,290
There, there, Manon.

1063
01:02:28,262 --> 01:02:29,860
Why are you crying?

1064
01:02:29,861 --> 01:02:33,700
- Me? Oh, it's the flowers. I'm, er... allergic.
- Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry.

1065
01:02:33,701 --> 01:02:35,661
- It's all right.
- Oh.

1066
01:02:35,662 --> 01:02:37,861
No, no, no, Manon.
It's fine, really.

1067
01:02:37,861 --> 01:02:43,165
- No, don't do that.
- Bloody things! I don't like them anyway.

1068
01:02:55,141 --> 01:02:57,019
- What would you do?
- Me?

1069
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:01,258
Yes. You're clearly a woman of the
world. What do you think of him?

1070
01:03:01,259 --> 01:03:02,819
- Your husband?
- Yes.

1071
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:07,258
- Well, I mean, he's fine. He's...
- Fine?

1072
01:03:07,259 --> 01:03:09,818
Actually, I think
he's a bit callous.

1073
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:13,178
I'm sorry, I think
you could do better.

1074
01:03:13,179 --> 01:03:14,898
I think he probably...

1075
01:03:14,899 --> 01:03:18,297
I think he probably treats you
like a piece of jewellery.

1076
01:03:18,298 --> 01:03:19,898
I think he probably
treats you badly.

1077
01:03:19,899 --> 01:03:23,737
That's not to say he can't change.
I mean, they can change. People do change.

1078
01:03:23,738 --> 01:03:29,016
But it's easy to say I love you while
you're rolling around on expensive sheets.

1079
01:03:29,017 --> 01:03:32,728
It's so much harder
when they need washing.

1080
01:03:35,418 --> 01:03:40,336
Look, I'm not who you think I am. I'm
sorry, I'm not Miriam from Weymouth.

1081
01:03:40,337 --> 01:03:43,736
I'm not even Katie from Texas.
I'm just Kate from Surrey.

1082
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:46,416
And my ex-husband is lying on the
floor next to your bed, I'm afraid.

1083
01:03:46,417 --> 01:03:48,175
- He is?
- Yep.

1084
01:03:48,176 --> 01:03:50,960
Oh! Hello.

1085
01:03:51,376 --> 01:03:53,895
- Hi.
- And why are you crying?

1086
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:56,417
The cats. But don't throw
them out the window.

1087
01:03:56,417 --> 01:04:02,015
- Oh, he's really handsome.
- I know. It's irritating.

1088
01:04:02,016 --> 01:04:04,615
- Not sure about the moustache.
- I agree.

1089
01:04:04,616 --> 01:04:07,375
The thing is, you see, your
husband stole something from us

1090
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:09,015
and from a lot of other
very good people.

1091
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:12,174
Something very valuable
to us: our future.

1092
01:04:12,175 --> 01:04:18,535
And so we came here tonight to take
back what we feel is rightfully ours.

1093
01:04:18,536 --> 01:04:20,454
Oh. The diamond.

1094
01:04:20,455 --> 01:04:23,814
- It's not very imaginative, I grant you.
- Sorry, my back was killing me.

1095
01:04:25,055 --> 01:04:29,574
- Manon, open up. It's Vincent.
- Take it. I don't like it anyway.

1096
01:04:29,575 --> 01:04:32,326
Great. Here's the fake.

1097
01:04:34,415 --> 01:04:35,813
Manon!

1098
01:04:37,295 --> 01:04:38,998
What?

1099
01:04:42,974 --> 01:04:44,852
Why are you throwing
flowers out the window?

1100
01:04:44,853 --> 01:04:48,881
I'm allergic. Don't you
know anything about me?

1101
01:04:50,734 --> 01:04:55,362
You must take good care of this.
It's not a toy, it's very valuable.

1102
01:04:55,733 --> 01:04:57,853
More valuable than me?

1103
01:04:57,853 --> 01:05:03,771
Darling, there is nothing on earth that is
more valuable to me than me... than you!

1104
01:05:03,772 --> 01:05:06,076
You should know that.

1105
01:05:09,933 --> 01:05:14,484
And will you still love me even
when we are washing the sheets?

1106
01:05:21,771 --> 01:05:23,595
Ssh!

1107
01:05:27,052 --> 01:05:28,250
What are you doing?

1108
01:05:28,251 --> 01:05:30,090
I don't know. I thought
you were about to sneeze.

1109
01:05:30,091 --> 01:05:33,203
- Causing a distraction's supposed to stop it.
- That's hiccups.

1110
01:05:33,372 --> 01:05:35,719
Ah... yes.

1111
01:05:36,651 --> 01:05:39,163
I might sneeze again.

1112
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:46,449
What are we doing?
We've got to get out of here.

1113
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:48,290
Oh, OK.

1114
01:05:48,291 --> 01:05:50,474
- What, back the way we came?
- Yes!

1115
01:06:08,409 --> 01:06:12,329
- Oh! Sorry, old partner.
- Sorry, sorry.

1116
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:13,792
Yeah, howdy.

1117
01:06:19,689 --> 01:06:24,327
Although not on the official schedule, my
new wife would like to say a few words.

1118
01:06:26,729 --> 01:06:32,608
A wise woman once told me that
you can love your husband

1119
01:06:32,609 --> 01:06:34,808
but you must also like him.

1120
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:40,287
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1121
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:44,240
And I finally realised that...

1122
01:06:45,487 --> 01:06:50,716
I don't love Vincent
or even like him.

1123
01:06:52,888 --> 01:06:56,359
So Vincent, darling...

1124
01:06:57,567 --> 01:06:59,599
I want a divorce.

1125
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:14,438
Stop! Stop! There's been
a travesty of justice.

1126
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:18,044
Catch them!

1127
01:07:18,045 --> 01:07:19,356
Catch them!

1128
01:07:20,885 --> 01:07:24,269
Hey! <i>Vive la révolution!</i>

1129
01:07:24,525 --> 01:07:26,795
<i>Vive la révolution!</i>

1130
01:07:27,405 --> 01:07:29,109
Oh!

1131
01:07:30,484 --> 01:07:33,476
- Oh, my God, no!
- No, no.

1132
01:07:42,565 --> 01:07:44,628
- Sorry, sorry.
- Sorry.

1133
01:07:44,923 --> 01:07:46,323
Ooh! Ow!

1134
01:07:46,324 --> 01:07:49,707
I knew there was something
familiar about you.

1135
01:07:49,723 --> 01:07:51,522
Ooh!

1136
01:07:51,524 --> 01:07:52,803
Ow!

1137
01:07:52,804 --> 01:07:54,508
Oh, no! They're real.

1138
01:07:54,883 --> 01:08:00,281
OK, let's make this simple.
Where is the real diamond?

1139
01:08:02,483 --> 01:08:04,922
Bloody hell.

1140
01:08:11,763 --> 01:08:14,362
- Oh!
- Oh, that's a whole other level of pain.

1141
01:08:14,363 --> 01:08:19,122
Look, we're just a disgruntled employee and
his pushy wife who want back what's theirs.

1142
01:08:19,123 --> 01:08:21,161
- You didn't say ex-wife.
- No, I didn't, did I?

1143
01:08:21,162 --> 01:08:22,961
- Mmm...
- We should focus.

1144
01:08:22,962 --> 01:08:25,506
- Right.
- Have you ever heard of karma?

1145
01:08:26,161 --> 01:08:29,080
Perhaps you're being punished
for all the bad things

1146
01:08:29,081 --> 01:08:32,104
that you might have
done in your life.

1147
01:08:34,721 --> 01:08:36,664
It's just a thought.

1148
01:08:37,482 --> 01:08:40,800
Oh, no! That's just mean!
You're just being a bully now!

1149
01:08:40,801 --> 01:08:43,029
Be grateful, I don't hit women.

1150
01:08:43,561 --> 01:08:47,709
Now, tell me where my diamond is!

1151
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,911
I swallowed it.

1152
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,678
I sold the diamond.

1153
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:08,960
What?

1154
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,908
I swapped it and sold the real one.

1155
01:09:12,678 --> 01:09:17,357
Gave the money to charity,
an orphanage in Calcutta.

1156
01:09:17,358 --> 01:09:18,958
What? Why?

1157
01:09:18,959 --> 01:09:21,558
A test, to see if you
really loved me.

1158
01:09:21,559 --> 01:09:24,358
You're crazy. I'll
deal with you later.

1159
01:09:24,358 --> 01:09:26,902
Get rid of them.

1160
01:09:27,239 --> 01:09:28,357
Oh, no.

1161
01:09:28,358 --> 01:09:30,757
OK, er...

1162
01:09:30,758 --> 01:09:33,237
If I'd known, I'd have
worn better underwear.

1163
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:35,716
I don't think it's your underwear
you should be worrying about, Pen.

1164
01:09:35,717 --> 01:09:37,597
- These things reveal everything.
- What do you mean?

1165
01:09:37,598 --> 01:09:40,502
- Yeah, every nook and cranny.
- Oh, God!

1166
01:09:42,758 --> 01:09:44,625
What are you looking at?

1167
01:09:45,876 --> 01:09:48,704
Damn cheek!

1168
01:09:56,637 --> 01:09:58,436
Oh, yes, that's, er... Saigon,

1169
01:09:58,437 --> 01:10:01,796
Vietnam, 1964.

1170
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:04,236
Took a bit of shrapnel, yeah.

1171
01:10:04,237 --> 01:10:07,828
Bloody hell, they left some forceps
in there. Look, the clamp's in there.

1172
01:10:08,236 --> 01:10:09,595
- I didn't know that.
- You can go.

1173
01:10:09,596 --> 01:10:11,060
Bloody Vietnam.

1174
01:10:12,396 --> 01:10:15,834
- Take them to the cliff.
- Huh? The cliff?

1175
01:10:15,835 --> 01:10:18,435
Whisky? A last drink?

1176
01:10:18,436 --> 01:10:20,835
Not my tipple.

1177
01:10:25,995 --> 01:10:28,994
- I do hope they'll be all right, Jerry.
- I'm sure they'll be fine, love.

1178
01:10:28,995 --> 01:10:30,700
- Do you think?
- Yeah.

1179
01:10:41,874 --> 01:10:44,393
Stop whistling, Richard.

1180
01:10:44,395 --> 01:10:47,393
- Please, stop whistling. It drives me mad.
- Helps me relax, Kate.

1181
01:10:47,394 --> 01:10:49,992
Well, it doesn't help me relax.
It's driving me bloody mad.

1182
01:10:49,993 --> 01:10:52,177
OK, I'll stop. I've stopped
whistling now, OK?

1183
01:11:06,552 --> 01:11:08,831
We've stopped.

1184
01:11:08,832 --> 01:11:10,580
Yes.

1185
01:11:16,593 --> 01:11:18,940
- We're moving.
- Yes.

1186
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:30,431
- Kate.
- What?

1187
01:11:30,432 --> 01:11:32,350
- I just wanted to say...
- What?

1188
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:34,471
I just wanted to say, Kate,
that whatever happens...

1189
01:11:34,472 --> 01:11:38,859
- You're not trying to do a final speech, are you?
- No, not at all. Well, maybe a little.

1190
01:11:42,272 --> 01:11:43,910
It's just that...

1191
01:11:43,911 --> 01:11:45,470
- Shut up!
- All right, I will.

1192
01:11:50,631 --> 01:11:52,094
Oh!

1193
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:54,615
- Oh!
- Oh!

1194
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:59,654
Don't... move.

1195
01:12:09,789 --> 01:12:11,988
- Oh.
- Ohh!

1196
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:14,108
- What's going on?
- We're going back. We're going back!

1197
01:12:14,109 --> 01:12:16,709
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh.

1198
01:12:16,709 --> 01:12:19,014
No, no, no, no.

1199
01:12:20,509 --> 01:12:22,627
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry, Kate.

1200
01:12:22,628 --> 01:12:23,947
What for?

1201
01:12:23,949 --> 01:12:26,581
For not being a good husband.

1202
01:12:27,788 --> 01:12:29,268
I'm sorry too, then.

1203
01:12:29,269 --> 01:12:31,228
For what?

1204
01:12:31,229 --> 01:12:32,907
For not letting you be one.

1205
01:12:32,908 --> 01:12:34,627
What do you mean?

1206
01:12:34,628 --> 01:12:36,386
- We were too young.
- Uh-huh.

1207
01:12:36,388 --> 01:12:40,853
It takes two, you know, to totally ruin
a marriage, and I played my part.

1208
01:12:41,029 --> 01:12:42,307
Oh, God!

1209
01:12:42,308 --> 01:12:44,826
Anyway, what does it
matter now? We're...

1210
01:12:47,107 --> 01:12:48,571
We're going to die!

1211
01:12:51,427 --> 01:12:55,816
- Richard!
- It's OK. I've got you. Hold on.

1212
01:12:57,227 --> 01:13:00,218
Kate, I think we should try again.

1213
01:13:01,308 --> 01:13:03,826
- Try what again?
- Me and you.

1214
01:13:03,827 --> 01:13:05,826
What are you talking
about, Richard?

1215
01:13:05,827 --> 01:13:08,265
I think we should finally sail round the
world, like we've always talked about.

1216
01:13:08,266 --> 01:13:10,306
I've had such a great
time these past few days.

1217
01:13:10,307 --> 01:13:13,747
Could you just concentrate?
Concentrate on holding on!

1218
01:13:13,747 --> 01:13:16,585
- Well, don't you feel anything, Kate?
- Yes, fear!

1219
01:13:16,586 --> 01:13:18,933
All right. OK.
Well, just think about it.

1220
01:13:20,505 --> 01:13:23,705
I like you, I really like you.

1221
01:13:29,145 --> 01:13:31,208
Come on, you fucker!

1222
01:13:32,225 --> 01:13:33,973
Come on!

1223
01:13:43,744 --> 01:13:45,024
- Are you OK?
- Manon!

1224
01:13:45,025 --> 01:13:48,864
- Manon!
- Oh! Oh, thank you. Thank you!

1225
01:13:48,864 --> 01:13:52,623
Oh, no, it is I who should be thanking
you for making me see things clearly.

1226
01:13:52,624 --> 01:13:53,983
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

1227
01:13:55,585 --> 01:13:57,812
We must go. Help me.

1228
01:13:58,384 --> 01:14:00,263
Here we go.

1229
01:14:15,903 --> 01:14:18,902
- Nice girl, passionate.
- Oh, I do hope she'll be all right.

1230
01:14:18,902 --> 01:14:21,370
Oh, a headstrong girl
like her, she'll be fine.

1231
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:23,222
We're gonna have to swim
out of here. You know that?

1232
01:14:23,223 --> 01:14:26,581
- We'll be sitting ducks.
- Yeah, well, do you have a better idea?

1233
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:28,021
I know a man with a boat.

1234
01:14:28,022 --> 01:14:29,290
- You do?
- Yeah.

1235
01:14:35,541 --> 01:14:38,621
- Online?
- Yes, Richard, online.

1236
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:43,860
You chat, you get to know each other, and you
agree to meet up, if you like each other.

1237
01:14:43,861 --> 01:14:46,059
- But you've never met him?
- No, not yet.

1238
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,700
So you don't even know
if you'll like him.

1239
01:14:47,701 --> 01:14:49,341
Well, he's 57. He lives in Paris

1240
01:14:49,341 --> 01:14:51,660
and has house and a boat in the
south of France. What's not to like?

1241
01:14:51,661 --> 01:14:54,849
Good heavens, Kate!
How shallow you've become.

1242
01:14:57,861 --> 01:15:00,372
That must be the captain.

1243
01:15:02,501 --> 01:15:06,606
Bonjour, Kate.
It's me, Jean-Baptiste.

1244
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:09,371
Bloody hell!

1245
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:19,899
You know, I'm twice your age.

1246
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:22,858
What can I say? I like older women.

1247
01:15:22,859 --> 01:15:25,218
Why lie on your profile?

1248
01:15:25,218 --> 01:15:30,058
I want women to see me as a mature man.
Otherwise, I feel like a total cliché, you know?

1249
01:15:30,059 --> 01:15:35,692
Young, rich, handsome, with a
speedboat... So terribly predictable.

1250
01:15:38,218 --> 01:15:40,337
He's your lover?

1251
01:15:40,339 --> 01:15:42,138
Ex-lover.

1252
01:15:42,139 --> 01:15:44,409
But you still have
some feelings for him?

1253
01:15:49,217 --> 01:15:51,010
I don't know.

1254
01:15:51,378 --> 01:15:53,802
It's not good to look back.

1255
01:15:54,578 --> 01:15:56,136
No, you're right.

1256
01:15:56,137 --> 01:15:58,649
- It can make you feel a bit sick.
- Oh.

1257
01:16:03,217 --> 01:16:04,815
Shall we head back?

1258
01:16:04,816 --> 01:16:07,337
- Well, actually...
- We are going out.

1259
01:16:07,337 --> 01:16:10,056
- Oh, really? Out?
- Yes, on a date.

1260
01:16:10,057 --> 01:16:12,655
- Well, not a date. Not...
- Yes, a date.

1261
01:16:12,656 --> 01:16:15,054
But what about the, er...

1262
01:16:15,055 --> 01:16:16,616
...diamond?

1263
01:16:16,617 --> 01:16:18,768
You can handle that, can't you?

1264
01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:22,256
Are you telling me you don't
want to see this through now?

1265
01:16:22,256 --> 01:16:26,454
No, I... Well, I think so. I mean,
can't you deal with it on your own?

1266
01:16:26,455 --> 01:16:28,563
I'll meet you at the
rendezvous in Paris.

1267
01:16:29,656 --> 01:16:31,095
Right.

1268
01:16:31,097 --> 01:16:33,574
Right, I see. Well...

1269
01:16:33,575 --> 01:16:37,454
I suppose I did start all this for a
reason and the reason was for the...

1270
01:16:37,455 --> 01:16:40,119
for the people, for...
for Doreen, for...

1271
01:16:42,375 --> 01:16:44,893
Right, I'll be off, then.

1272
01:16:44,894 --> 01:16:47,885
- You take good care of her.
- I will.

1273
01:16:54,614 --> 01:16:58,934
So, first of all, we have
some champagne at my villa.

1274
01:16:58,935 --> 01:17:02,013
OK. It's a bit early,
isn't it, for champagne?

1275
01:17:02,014 --> 01:17:05,246
It's never too early for champagne.
It's always too late.

1276
01:17:07,694 --> 01:17:09,213
Ah!

1277
01:17:09,214 --> 01:17:11,852
Oh, thank goodness. You made it.

1278
01:17:11,853 --> 01:17:13,052
Where's Kate?

1279
01:17:13,053 --> 01:17:15,531
Ah, she's not here.

1280
01:17:15,532 --> 01:17:17,237
Where is she?

1281
01:17:17,732 --> 01:17:19,372
- She's with a Frenchman.
- Oh!

1282
01:17:19,372 --> 01:17:22,653
- What Frenchman?
- Jean-Baptiste.

1283
01:17:22,654 --> 01:17:24,292
You knew about him?

1284
01:17:24,293 --> 01:17:26,572
Oh! Oh, right. Jean-Baptiste, yeah.

1285
01:17:26,573 --> 01:17:28,812
Did everybody know about the
Frenchman apart from me?

1286
01:17:28,813 --> 01:17:31,292
But why is she meeting him?
You're back together now.

1287
01:17:31,293 --> 01:17:33,572
No, Pen, we're not back together.

1288
01:17:33,573 --> 01:17:36,291
You seemed so happy so we
just went along with it.

1289
01:17:36,292 --> 01:17:38,531
I suppose it was a bit
of a long shot anyway.

1290
01:17:38,532 --> 01:17:41,730
Probably wouldn't have
worked second time around.

1291
01:17:41,731 --> 01:17:43,731
Exactly.

1292
01:17:43,732 --> 01:17:47,250
Anyway, the diamond. Where is it?

1293
01:17:47,251 --> 01:17:49,531
- Ah, yeah.
- There's been a slight delay.

1294
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:52,883
Yeah, but... Pen's got me
on the old prune juice.

1295
01:17:53,531 --> 01:17:55,090
Should get the bomb doors open.

1296
01:17:57,051 --> 01:17:59,250
Maybe? No, false alarm.

1297
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:26,689
- Where are you going?
- Ah, good morning.

1298
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:28,481
There is a robe on the chair.

1299
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:38,488
- I'm so sorry about last night.
- Oh, Jean-Baptiste, it was lovely.

1300
01:18:38,489 --> 01:18:41,993
- Yeah, but I drunk too much and...
- It happens. You're young.

1301
01:18:42,208 --> 01:18:45,128
You've got much more experience
than me. That thing that you did...

1302
01:18:45,128 --> 01:18:47,368
Oh, thank you.

1303
01:18:47,369 --> 01:18:49,288
So, what would you
like to do today?

1304
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:51,447
We can have some
breakfast outside or...

1305
01:18:51,448 --> 01:18:54,286
We can take my boat somewhere.
You can practise your French.

1306
01:18:55,927 --> 01:18:57,555
Ooh.

1307
01:18:58,048 --> 01:19:00,206
- You like this song?
- I love this song.

1308
01:19:00,207 --> 01:19:02,926
- Who is it?
- Free. You know...

1309
01:19:02,927 --> 01:19:05,206
♪ All right now ♪

1310
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:07,316
No, I don't know this band.

1311
01:19:07,767 --> 01:19:11,151
No... of course you don't.

1312
01:19:14,846 --> 01:19:18,926
It was the linseeds that ultimately
did it, such a smooth transition.

1313
01:19:18,927 --> 01:19:20,405
- Well done, Jerry.
- Darling.

1314
01:19:20,406 --> 01:19:23,606
Amazing. Look at it.
It's beautiful. Touch it.

1315
01:19:23,606 --> 01:19:25,671
No, I think I'll pass, Jerry.

1316
01:19:26,046 --> 01:19:27,604
Thank you.

1317
01:19:27,605 --> 01:19:30,924
Where is this man, Diamond Dave?

1318
01:19:30,925 --> 01:19:33,350
Patience, my dear, patience.

1319
01:19:34,205 --> 01:19:36,124
- I'm sure she's coming, Richard.
- Mmm.

1320
01:19:36,125 --> 01:19:38,277
I don't think so, Pen.

1321
01:19:39,205 --> 01:19:40,877
Thanks, anyway.

1322
01:19:41,484 --> 01:19:45,364
I don't understand. What
is the Eye of the Rainbow?

1323
01:19:45,365 --> 01:19:48,083
It's a diamond that we stole.

1324
01:19:48,084 --> 01:19:53,403
But first we had to kidnap the Texans, scuba
to the chateau and break into a wedding.

1325
01:19:53,405 --> 01:19:56,233
- You stole a diamond?
- Yes.

1326
01:19:57,804 --> 01:20:00,483
- I'm not gonna make it.
- Yes, you will.

1327
01:20:09,965 --> 01:20:13,882
It's Diamond Dave.
He hasn't changed a bit.

1328
01:20:13,883 --> 01:20:17,071
- Don't take less than ten.
- Right you are.

1329
01:20:27,562 --> 01:20:30,321
- I just don't get it.
- What, my love?

1330
01:20:30,322 --> 01:20:32,442
How you know all these people?

1331
01:20:32,443 --> 01:20:34,921
- Who?
- Well, Diamond bloody Dave.

1332
01:20:34,923 --> 01:20:37,642
- Oh, you know, way back.
- No, I don't know, Jerry.

1333
01:20:37,643 --> 01:20:41,081
I don't know about Saigon or
Guam or the Foreign Legion.

1334
01:20:41,082 --> 01:20:44,600
- Or even Diamond bloody Dave. I really don't.
- It's all right. Calm down.

1335
01:20:44,601 --> 01:20:47,560
No, I won't calm down.
Who are these people, Jerry?

1336
01:20:47,561 --> 01:20:52,000
These contacts? All that metal
in your body? This past life?

1337
01:20:52,001 --> 01:20:54,400
I thought I knew you.
I thought we were the same.

1338
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,792
Oh, Pen.

1339
01:21:00,001 --> 01:21:02,545
I'm more than the sum of my parts.

1340
01:21:02,961 --> 01:21:07,392
- What does that mean?
- I've got no idea.

1341
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:11,559
But what I do know
is that I love you.

1342
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:16,428
Always have, always will. OK?

1343
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:19,919
- OK.
- Yeah!

1344
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,151
- Got 15.
- Bloody hell.

1345
01:21:33,759 --> 01:21:36,118
You can literally go anywhere
from here, can't you?

1346
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:38,870
Well, we've got a
briefcase full of cash.

1347
01:21:39,799 --> 01:21:41,437
Penelope!

1348
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:43,786
There's one back to
London in 50 minutes.

1349
01:21:45,639 --> 01:21:48,598
No, I don't think we
should get that one.

1350
01:21:48,599 --> 01:21:50,705
- Kate!
- Hey-hey!

1351
01:21:52,877 --> 01:21:54,957
Listen, what do you think about...

1352
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:58,582
I don't know, maybe doing a bit of
travelling before we head home?

1353
01:21:59,557 --> 01:22:00,749
Travelling?

1354
01:22:02,197 --> 01:22:05,396
- Well...
- Stupid idea, right?

1355
01:22:05,397 --> 01:22:07,189
Yes.

1356
01:22:07,758 --> 01:22:13,029
A crazy... daft... stupid...

1357
01:22:13,797 --> 01:22:16,116
but brilliant idea.

1358
01:22:16,117 --> 01:22:17,715
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Why the hell not?

1359
01:22:17,716 --> 01:22:20,475
- What have we got to lose?
- Apart from our dignity?

1360
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:22,748
Either way, it's
worth investigating.

1361
01:22:22,876 --> 01:22:26,021
Definitely. Let's investigate.

1362
01:22:27,036 --> 01:22:29,314
Would you see that the
relevant people get this?

1363
01:22:29,315 --> 01:22:30,516
It would be an honour, my friend.

1364
01:22:30,517 --> 01:22:33,595
I've, er... taken a bit out. You can
stash the rest under the mattress.

1365
01:22:33,596 --> 01:22:36,915
Don't worry, old pal. We've got a
safe house built under the stairs.

1366
01:22:36,916 --> 01:22:39,580
- We do?
- Yeah.

1367
01:22:41,196 --> 01:22:43,304
<i>Bon voyage</i>, my old friends.

1368
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:45,754
- I'll feed the cat.
- Oh, thank you.

1369
01:22:45,755 --> 01:22:47,195
- Look after yourselves.
- We will.

1370
01:22:47,196 --> 01:22:48,354
Thank you.

1371
01:22:48,355 --> 01:22:50,875
- Come along, Jerry.
- Be very, very naughty.

1372
01:22:50,875 --> 01:22:53,659
- It's is very heavy, Jerry.
- Hey-hey!

1373
01:22:54,194 --> 01:22:56,619
- Come on, my love.
- I say...

1374
01:22:57,675 --> 01:22:59,619
Oh... yes.

1375
01:23:00,634 --> 01:23:02,426
<i>Merci.</i>

1376
01:23:04,794 --> 01:23:06,552
Come on.

1377
01:23:06,554 --> 01:23:08,182
Come on!

1378
01:23:19,633 --> 01:23:21,392
Oh, yay!

1379
01:23:21,393 --> 01:23:22,912
Right. Yay!

1380
01:23:22,913 --> 01:23:24,586

A wander around the Marais?

1387
01:23:54,871 --> 01:23:57,535
Hmm, that would be nice.

1388
01:23:57,992 --> 01:24:03,070
But... I was thinking of something
a little more adventurous.

1389
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:07,023
Adventurous? Marvellous.
When are we leaving?

1390
01:24:07,791 --> 01:24:10,215
What about right now?

1391
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:12,815

- I did it!

1399
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:32,747
- You bought us a boat!
- I did it!

1400
01:24:32,749 --> 01:24:34,667
Don't fall in. Don't
fall in the Seine.
