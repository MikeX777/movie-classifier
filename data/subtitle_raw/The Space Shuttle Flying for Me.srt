1
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,440
Fergie, Doug, Sandy, and Rex.

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,976
Good luck, God speed, and have
a little fun up there.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,278
Verify ready to resume count
and go for launch.

4
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:17,183
Two, one, zero and lift off.

5
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,795
When the engines light and
then those solid rocket boosters

6
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:22,322
light you know you're
gonna go flying.

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:26,226
If the bolts didn't fire
they would pull the
launch pad with it.

8
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,560
It's that much power.

9
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:36,436
Having a chance to fly
the most amazing flying
machine ever built

10
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,338
was just incredible.

11
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,675
Every time a child draws
a spaceship for us and

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,578
sends it to us it's in the
shape of a Space Shuttle.

13
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:49,883
That image, the silhouette of
the Space Shuttle is an iconic

14
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:55,422
image that I think is going
to last for generations.

15
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:59,659
The pure number of
astronauts that

16
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:02,695
the Space Shuttle program
brought to space

17
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,965
have made a difference
for humanity.

18
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:09,402
What I think one of the
most lasting achievements of the

19
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,972
shuttle program was I think it
allowed us to carry so many

20
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,775
people into orbit that had such
a wide spectrum of backgrounds

21
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:19,212
and capabilities and it allowed
young people to dream.

22
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,604
This exhibit is a
powerful reminder of NASA's

23
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:49,676
unmatched accomplishments
during more than 50 years
of exploration

24
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,948
and the great
future that lies ahead.

25
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:01,554
With their payload bay
doors wide open,

26
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:05,792
Atlantis is literally reaching
out with open arms to welcome

27
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:10,597
all visitors, create
our unprecedented
achievements in space,

28
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,966
and inspire a new generation.

29
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,805
Atlantis has flown 126
million miles in space,

30
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,474
2 and a half million
handmade parts.

31
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:24,677
It was made by
man and it was
made by people
that were

32
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:28,014
dedicated to the
program for over 30
years and that
really is

33
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,516
something really special.

34
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,320
This is not the end of
the program and

35
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,523
thats really a strong message.

36
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:40,994
We've got a great opportunity
on STS-136 here, which is the

37
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:44,464
next mission for Atlantis
and that is to inspire

38
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,632
and teach and really

39
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,002
get the next generation of
kids ready to go to space.

40
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,171
Of my 7 Space
Shuttle flights,
5 of them

41
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,239
were on the Space
Shuttle Atlantis
so obviously

42
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,608
Atlantis is my favorite bird.

43
00:02:55,642 --> 00:03:00,113
But when I first walked into the
facility down there I was

44
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:04,017
overwhelmed and then when the
curtains opened and you walk out

45
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,021
and see Atlantis being so
perfectly displayed

46
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:11,424
it was a very melancholy
moment for me.

47
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,560
I had a mixture of emotions.

48
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:17,931
I had an overwhelming
joy of seeing it being
displayed so well

49
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,501
so that people could get up
close to it and see the wonders

50
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:25,538
of the incredible devise,
the incredible hardware
that we flew in space.

51
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,708
But at the same time I had this
feeling that I wish we were

52
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,978
still flying to vehicle
because because it was an
incredible flying machine.

53
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,681
And it gave us capabilities
to operate in space

54
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,883
we may never see again.

55
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,255
After 30 years of missions,

56
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:45,058
the Space Shuttle
program is over.

57
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:48,761
The orbiters are now gifts to
the American people.

58
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:53,099
Atlantis at the Kennedy
Space Center visitors
complex in Florida...

59
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,535
Discovery now at the
Smithsonian National Air

60
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,904
And Space Musuem in Virginia...

61
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,540
Endeavour put on quite a show
on its way to the California

62
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,009
Science Center in Los Angeles.

63
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:06,079
And Enterprise, the
first shuttle used
only in test landings,

64
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:11,351
is on display at the
Intrepid Sea-Air-Space
Museum in New York City

65
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,487
with the massive orbiters
relegated to museums,

66
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,058
2011 and the final flight
of the Space Shuttle is

67
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,193
now but a dream...

68
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,572
We would go down to
places like the
Kennedy Space
Center

69
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,200
and people would
come up to us and
say ' Hey just
want to

70
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,912
let you know I've been
working for 25 years and
this is my last day.'

71
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,537
And at first you would say,

72
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,307
I'm so sorry but almost to a
person they would come back

73
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,742
and say ' No don't be sorry.

74
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,212
I am so happy that I was able to
be a part of this program.'

75
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,481
And so it was really
amazing to see the
dedication people

76
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:42,915
had to that program.

77
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,127
But there's one other thing the
shuttle would be remembered for.

78
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,519
Beauty.

79
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:48,621
The shuttle was just as
beautiful on its last flight

80
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,922
as it was on its first.

81
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,458
When we were in the Astrovan on
the way to the launch pad for

82
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:56,229
STS-135, we rounded the final
curb and headed straight for it.

83
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,331
The view of the shuttle on the
launch pad was simply

84
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,199
breathtaking as it always is.

85
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:04,404
2, 1, 0 and lift off.

86
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,572
The final lift off of Atlantis.

87
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,751
People always say how does it
feel to fly the last flight

88
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,210
and for me the time it
hit me the most I think was when

89
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,646
we undocked from the space
station and I was looking out

90
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,082
the window and I could see the
station and I was shooting a

91
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,552
hand held laser to give us data
about how for it was away.

92
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,488
Then I backed away from the
window and kind of floated down

93
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,625
to a corner and as I
did I had a few seconds

94
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,394
and I heard Ron Garren
on the Radio say,

95
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,896
"Atlantis will be parting from

96
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:33,333
the International Space Station
for the last time."

97
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,344
And it just gave me a little
bit of a lump in the throat

98
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,703
and I go, "Wow this is it."

99
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:39,305
Atlantis weighs anchor from
the International Space Station

100
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,606
for the last time.

101
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,509
Twelve and a half years of
shuttle missions to build and

102
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,978
service a million pound
complex at an end.

103
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,384
Space Shuttle flight
director and NASA veteran

104
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:55,388
since the 1960's, Milt Heflin,
is the only person to be present

105
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:58,524
at the final
splashdown of Apollo,
and the final landing

106
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,460
of the Space Shuttle.

107
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:03,663
When Atlantis came
out of the
darkness for the
135 landing at

108
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,365
the end of the
runway my
thought was

109
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:08,134
boy, she is really
strutting her stuff.

110
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:13,005
She is kind of looking at us and
telling us, ok, you guys we're

111
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,275
really good at what we're doing
and we're stopping it.

112
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,544
I just want you to know I
recognize that,

113
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:23,049
I'm not happy about that,
but we have accomplished
a lot in this program.

114
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,153
The final touchdown of
Atlantis ended an era for
the world's

115
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,455
first and only re-usable
spacecraft...

116
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:34,427
I believe the
Space Shuttle is
going to go down
in history as

117
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:41,100
one of the most
remarkable advances
in aviation and in
space ever.

118
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,702
A reusable space vehicle.

119
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,237
We have never had one before.

120
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,141
That was such a
giant leap forward.

121
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:52,278
I think we've also done
an awfully lot in the
last 30 years.

122
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:55,581
The shuttle and the
space station,

123
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:59,819
international
partnership, the
total spectrum of
what has come

124
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:04,290
out of that
activity in my
judgment is equal
to at least

125
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:07,427
the accomplishment of
landing on the moon.

126
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,165
It is a vehicle that houses
1960's and 1970's technology.

127
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,768
We have learned to take these
technologies and put them to

128
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:19,672
work and get more
out of them then
we ever imagined
before.

129
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,675
You had an airplane that
could launch like a rocket,

130
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:25,044
go up into space and
be a spacecraft,

131
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:29,782
spend 2 weeks in orbit, fly back
down and land on a runway

132
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:32,118
like a big cargo airplane.

133
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:37,924
Nothing before it and nothing
since has taken its place.

134
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,993
The concept of a re-usable
space plane has been around as
long as

135
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:44,096
NASA began launching men
into orbit with rockets,

136
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,767
beginning with the Mercury
Program in the early 1960's.

137
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,171
With Gemini and later Apollo,
the rockets only got bigger as

138
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:55,107
the United States landed on the
Moon in the first 10 years of

139
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,776
its space program.

140
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,846
Tranquility Base here.
The Eagle has landed.

141
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,515
The moon landings were
mankind's greatest feat,

142
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:05,718
but as john young and charlie
duke scampered on the moon's

143
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:09,722
surface in the spring of 1972,
Congress approved funding for

144
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:14,560
NASA's next goal... to make Space
a livable and workable place...

145
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,063
at a more affordable price.

146
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,599
The people who got us to the
Moon began to turn their

147
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,668
attention to the Space Shuttle.

148
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:27,907
The concept was re-usable
and I think that was a
nobel endeavor

149
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,876
and it turned out to be a
re-usable space craft

150
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:33,012
took a lot of care and feeding
but that was the goal.

151
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,882
Glynn Lunney, a veteran flight
director of Apollo,

152
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:39,485
would become one the
early program managers
of the Space Shuttle.

153
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,724
NASA and the space team had a
pretty clear goal

154
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:48,461
of building a
machine that could
take people and
things

155
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,430
up the Earth's
orbit and bring
them back home

156
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,266
and it could do it
fairly lively,

157
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,935
much more reliably then we
were doing with the Apollo

158
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,937
and it could do it more cheaply.

159
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,842
When it was ultimately approved
by President Nixon in 1972

160
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:07,446
the whole project picked up a
great amount of steam and moved

161
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,683
forward in the design of this
vehicle turned out to be

162
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:16,022
partially re-usable and
thats what took us into
the shuttle program.

163
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:20,993
As Lunney oversaw the
Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz
missions of the mid-70's,

164
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,762
the shuttle began to take shape.

165
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:26,699
So while we were doing
that there was major
progress being made

166
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:31,337
in the design and construction
of the Space Shuttle

167
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,407
and I give full credit
to Bob Thompson who was

168
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,276
the program manager on all
those years of the 70's

169
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,679
and to his team of people.

170
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,814
So the issue we're arguing
is a functional test.

171
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,816
You ought a just function a
test...

172
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,452
We thought we might want
to build a two stage fully
re-usable

173
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:51,023
vehicle with a big flyback
booster at Marshall and a
big orbiter.

174
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:54,093
A JSC much like the Apollo mode.

175
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,929
But that vehicle was
quite complex.

176
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,998
It cost quite a bit.

177
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:03,669
So we figured out a more simple
way to do the same thing

178
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,571
which in my judgement
turned out to be

179
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,974
a better way to do
the whole thing.

180
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,343
The Space Shuttle was a
new way to fly.

181
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,112
Its development was plagued
by cost overruns,

182
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,515
delays, and critics,
but by 1981,

183
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,619
Apollo veteran John Young
and rookie Bob Crippen

184
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:22,321
were ready to fly the
shuttle's first mission.

185
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,057
With its solid rocket boosters,
external tank,

186
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,259
and main engines on
the Orbiter Columbia,

187
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,929
the Space Shuttle was
set to make history.

188
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,797
And on April 12th, Columbia
blasted off from

189
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,334
Launch Complex 39 at
Kennedy Space Center...

190
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,904
6,5,4 we've gone
from main engine starts

191
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:58,024
And the shuttle
has cleared the tower.

192
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,027
It was almost miraculous
that it flew that first time.

193
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,296
A friend of mine
in the astronaut
office said it

194
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,434
looked like a
butterfly bolted
to a bullet.

195
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:12,104
It just took my breath away,
it rattled my bones to be that

196
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:14,440
close to a space launch.

197
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,243
As soon as Columbia lifted
off... Mission Control at

198
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,979
Johnson Space Center in
Houston took over the flight.

199
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,082
Milt Heflin was monitoring the
orbiter's power systems in a

200
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,383
back room that day.

201
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,819
I'm fully expecting
as this thing launches,

202
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,188
I'm looking at numbers
on a display.

203
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,589
I'm looking at power
distribution,

204
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,058
the fuel cell operation.

205
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:38,631
I was amazed how as we
launched that it was just...

206
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:40,266
have we really launched?

207
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:44,136
It looks to me that by the
displays here hardly
anything is changing.

208
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,105
Very surprising.

209
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,275
Took a little while to get
over that good feeling.

210
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:54,146
Space transportation
system or STS-1 would be
a near perfect flight,

211
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,783
landing on a dry lake bed at
Edwards Air Force Base

212
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,752
two days later.

213
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,354
The Space Shuttle would be a
game changer for NASA.

214
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:07,226
And over the next 30 years,
355 astronauts and cosmonauts

215
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,296
would fly on a shuttle,
all describing it as the

216
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,998
most incredible flying
machine ever built.

217
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,749
It's a behemoth, it's a monster,

218
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,450
its a skyscraper
right in front
of you.

219
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,319
Gleaming white under the lights.

220
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,755
Making noise,
it's groaning and
moaning because

221
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:39,391
of the liquid hydrogen
thats inside of it.

222
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,395
You get your suit on, you
make the five, six mile trip

223
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,500
out to the pad and then
we take turns getting in,

224
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,736
but as a pilot
during that time
you're thinking
about

225
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,038
every scenario
that you've been
trained for.

226
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:59,011
For me, my technique was
I got in and strapped
the vehicle to my body.

227
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,813
It became an extension of me.

228
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,916
You have to remember it's a four
and a half million pound vehicle

229
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,686
sitting on its tail, thats
going to lift off under

230
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,891
several million pounds of
thrust, burn propellents
at a rate of twelve

231
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:15,528
tons a second, and go supersonic
in less than a minute.

232
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,497
There's no other vehicle that
operates like that.

233
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,800
And we have a go for auto
sequence start.

234
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,003
When it gets to
thirty seconds,
that's when it starts

235
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,238
to really get your attention.

236
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,107
Firing chain is armed.

237
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,352
And then as the clock's
counting down from thirty
seconds and

238
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,077
you see the ten, nine, eight,

239
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,747
T-minus ten, nine, eight

240
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,817
Suddenly I
felt this rush of
adrenaline because,

241
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,885
oh we're really gonna go right.

242
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,654
Seven, Six...

243
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,455
We're just inside seven seconds

244
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:48,360
the three Space
Shuttle main
engines ignite
sequentially.

245
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,029
Four, three...

246
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,740
And between the three of
them the produce about

247
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:53,465
a million pounds of thrust.

248
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,968
Two, one...

249
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,803
The solid rocket
boosters ignite.

250
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,139
Zero and lift off.

251
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,975
Lift off Lift off Lift off
and Lift off

252
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,511
And that is it. Bang

253
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,179
The shuttle has
cleared the tower.

254
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,681
That explosion out the back end

255
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:13,452
when those boosters
ignite is something that
could not be simulated.

256
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,055
Roger Roll Endeavour

257
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,690
Houston is now controlling.

258
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:19,992
You know you are
leaving town right now.

259
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:34,039
It's a lot like driving down in
a car with loose shocks on a

260
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:37,376
gravel road because it is just
bouncing and rocking.

261
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,845
I remember not being about to
read the screens out in the

262
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,414
front because we were
vibrating so much.

263
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,448
I was kind of like, wow

264
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:49,088
The sound is so intense you
feel it as much as hear it.

265
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:55,527
I remember looking at the mach
meter as it increased through

266
00:14:55,561 --> 00:15:00,966
mach 3 and I'm looking at it and
I said holy smokes.

267
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,170
And you find yourself going,
wow what a machine this is.

268
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,682
One minute fifty seconds into
the flight we're standing by for

269
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,851
separation of the twin solid
rocket boosters Discovery now

270
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,678
traveling 2,695 miles an hour.

271
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:17,149
At about 60 miles we're
leveled off and accelerating

272
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,385
at three times to
force of gravity.

273
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,754
Standing by for solid rocket
booster separation.

274
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,199
When you leave the atmosphere
and you lose the solid rockets

275
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,625
then it's nothing but pure
acceleration.

276
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,695
Big flash in the window and
they separate away and it was

277
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:33,866
instantly smooth, quiet and I
thought just for a second my

278
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,035
heart kind of leaped and
I thought oh my God

279
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,870
all the engines have stopped.

280
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,471
You know. We're going to die.

281
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:42,408
And that's when you experience
zero gravity for the first time.

282
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:50,082
Your introduction to
weightlessness is just
really fabulous.

283
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:54,653
All of the sudden everything
in the cabin is floating.

284
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,523
I used to have dreams when I was
a kid that I would run down

285
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:01,894
the street and put my arms
out in front of me and lift off

286
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:05,331
and fly like Peter
Pan or Superman

287
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:08,167
and thats what
weightlessness is like.

288
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,171
It's just the most
wonderful experience on
Earth or above Earth.

289
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:15,908
It is just the neatest thing
you can hover in midair.

290
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,077
You fly everywhere you go.

291
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,511
You don't have to walk anywhere.

292
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:26,852
Looking back at the
Earth whether it was in

293
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:30,089
daylight or in
darkness was
just amazing.

294
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:34,927
So when you're going 17,500
miles an hour every 45 minutes

295
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,564
the sun comes up or it goes down
as you're orbiting around the

296
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,833
Earth and watching the
transition as you're going from

297
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:45,204
darkness into daylight and then
back into darkness you know

298
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:49,041
45 minutes later was surreal.

299
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:52,444
You saw sights that you just
don't see on Earth.

300
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:56,582
When we talk about
discoveries and things that
happen to human beings

301
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,450
when they have the
opportunity to go to space

302
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,653
your perspective of our
Earth really changes.

303
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:06,058
My first time in space when I
looked up after we got to orbit

304
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:10,062
I saw this big island and
I realized it was the
continent of Africa.

305
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:14,333
And it was the continent from
which my heritage and I had

306
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:20,072
tears come down my face
because their were no
lines so all the study

307
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,641
of the geography of the planet
it just went out the window.

308
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,914
The Space Shuttle
actually operated like a
rocket during launch,

309
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:31,126
a spaceship while we're
in orbit but then it's a hundred

310
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,387
and ten ton glider when we
come back in for re entry
and landing.

311
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:39,058
Atlantis Houston you are
go for the de orbit burn.

312
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:43,195
We hit the atmosphere
about 4000 miles before
the landing point

313
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,763
and the heat starts to build up.

314
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,399
Copy Houston go for the
de orbit burn.

315
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,635
And outside it started
out black.

316
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:54,506
Then it got kind of grayish
outside and then went to white

317
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,845
and then yellow and orange and
it was flashing and I floated up

318
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:04,750
and looked down at the
nose cap and it's normally
a black carbon material

319
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,753
and it was carnation pink.

320
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,989
And my eyes got this big.

321
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:16,962
And embers are going by my
window, and I thought of a
couple of things,

322
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,198
I thought, wow, the simulator
doesn't do this

323
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:24,303
and then the second thing was,
I hope it's not important.

324
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:29,274
Atlantis is now 6 1/2
minutes from landing at
altitude 81,000 feet,

325
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,710
traveling 1700 miles per hour.

326
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:35,047
So we s-turn the vehicle to
control the energy as we get

327
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,515
lower in the atmosphere.

328
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,151
Once we come over the
top of the runway,

329
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,719
the pilots really go to work.

330
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:45,524
That's when we take manual
control for the first time
as we go sub-sonic.

331
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:48,427
Arrival announced by a twin
sonic boom as it drops

332
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,195
below the speed of sound.

333
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,631
And remember, at this point,
we're over the runway at

334
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:56,034
40,000 feet and in four minutes
we're going to be on ground.

335
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:59,538
The shuttle's decent rate is
20 times steeper than a
commercial airliner.

336
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:03,375
It's angle of attack, more
than seven times steeper.

337
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,620
You dive down to about two
thousand feet and you start the

338
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,680
nose up... you're aiming a
mile short of the runway.

339
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,616
And remember,
you're just a glider,

340
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,651
and you can't go around.

341
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:16,021
At 400 feet, the pilot puts
the landing gear down.

342
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,390
The gear is down and locked.

343
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:21,293
And then the commander
lands it around 200 knots.

344
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,300
Main gear touch down.

345
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,836
Pilot puts the drag sheet
out at about 185 or so.

346
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:35,007
And then you roll to a stop.

347
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,310
That last hour..the hour from
the burn until the wheel stops

348
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,679
on the runway is an
amazing hour.

349
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:44,616
And I'll never forget, I got
the biggest smile on my face

350
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,920
and said, "Wow, that was fun.

351
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,955
I want to go back and do that
all over again!"

352
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,399
The Space Shuttle program.

353
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:04,236
That was one of the programs
that I think that this country

354
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,972
had that pooled
everybody together.

355
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,974
Whenever there was a
Space Shuttle launch,

356
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:13,478
no matter where you were,
they felt pride in America.

357
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,348
The inspiration
for the American
people from

358
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,984
the
Space Shuttle
program, I think

359
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,787
is going to be
hard for us to
duplicate in
this country.

360
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,556
Almost 10 years after the
last Lunar Mission,

361
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,860
the U.S. Space program
roared back to life with
the Space Shuttle.

362
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,762
NASA, like the rest
of the country,

363
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:34,299
was changing with the times in
the new shuttle era.

364
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:38,537
Gone were the
chain-smoking skinny ties
of the Moon program days.

365
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,473
Milt Heflin, who was moving up
the ladder to flight director,

366
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,875
witnessed the transformation...

367
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,220
When the shuttle
program started,

368
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:50,782
as far as the men
and women... the
team in this room,

369
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:54,987
uh, and the way
they did their
business,

370
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,989
not a damn thing changed.

371
00:20:57,022 --> 00:21:01,493
Yes, and the difference
would have been that
more minorities...

372
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,630
women became a bigger
part of the team.

373
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:07,065
Outstanding, what they did.

374
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,901
The Astronaut Corps was taking
on a contemporary look too

375
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:14,206
when NASA announced a new
class of astronauts in 1978.

376
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,742
Designed to carry up
to 7 astronauts,

377
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,578
including pilots and
mission specialists,

378
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:23,382
the shuttle opened up
space travel to a wider
spectrum of candidates.

379
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:28,320
It wasn't until
Space Shuttle when
we specifically said

380
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:32,591
we really want to
include women and
minorities in the
mix.

381
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:36,495
We really evolved the type of
astronauts that we have.

382
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,830
The type of things that we
were able to do in space.

383
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,199
We had women doctors.

384
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:44,403
We had all kinds of people
that we brought in to the

385
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:47,839
space program, the likes of
which we had never seen before.

386
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:51,009
Well, it was pretty
exciting and this was
the largest group of

387
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,978
astronauts that they
had ever taken.

388
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,047
They were
actually going to
take six women.

389
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,218
I was
surprised that
took that many in
a class of 35

390
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,088
that were to start in mid-1978.

391
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,591
I think the six women
immediately became pretty close

392
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,795
because we knew that this was
going to be different for women.

393
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:14,700
They wanted to make sure that
women were suited to this kind

394
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:18,904
of position and I felt very
fortunate that I was part
of that group.

395
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:24,810
The thing that
I found very
interesting was
that NASA had

396
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,013
already accepted the idea
that they were going
to have women in this class.

397
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,514
I'm sure some our
male colleagues,

398
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:33,685
particularly the pilots who had
been to Viet Nam and probably

399
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,922
weren't used to working with
women professionally maybe

400
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,758
had their doubts of how
we were going to do.

401
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:43,161
But I think we quickly fit in
and proved that we were

402
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,730
going to do a good job.

403
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,966
It wasn't like the early
days of space exploration
where it was

404
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,303
test pilots flying vehicles
where we were learning.

405
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:53,314
We were going to take the Space
Shuttle and we were going to

406
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,674
live and work in
it in space and
were going to need
lots of

407
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,543
different skills
lots of different
experiences

408
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,613
and so the Astronaut Corps
actually reflected that.

409
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,015
America would soon
have new heroes...

410
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,953
Astronauts that represented
every segment of the
population...

411
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:13,458
The Challenger crew on STS-41G
in 1984 was a model of NASA's

412
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:16,428
next generation of space
explorers...

413
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,964
We had seven crew members.
The first time seven flew.

414
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,966
We had the first time foreign
payload specialist,

415
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,535
Mark Garneau from Canada flew
on board that flight.

416
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,772
And also another payload
specialist was from Australia.

417
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:30,509
Paul Scully-Power so, it was
quite an eclectic crew and

418
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:34,679
two of them were women,
Kathy Sullivan and Sally Ride.

419
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:39,284
Kathy and I were
going out and do a
space walk and
Kathy was

420
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:43,488
going to be the
very first woman in
the world to ever
do a space walk.

421
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:46,658
And there was a lot of media
attention and a lot of that had

422
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:50,362
to do with Bob Crippen, who flew
the very first shuttle flight

423
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,063
was the Commander
and Sally Ride,

424
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,733
being on that flight, being the
first American woman.

425
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,536
Nobody wanted to ask us any
questions, or talk to us.

426
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,738
They only wanted to talk
to those other three.

427
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:03,141
So we had a lot of time
kibitzing from the sidelines and

428
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:05,744
enjoying all the attention that
the other folks were getting.

429
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:10,348
The diversity of the class of
1978 would inspire waves of

430
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,284
astronauts to follow...

431
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,253
I didn't have
that goal to become
an astronaut
growing up.

432
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:19,057
Frankly, little girls couldn't
grow up to be astronauts in
the early sixty's.

433
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,726
And then when I was in college,
the first group of women

434
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,562
were selected as astronauts.

435
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:27,766
So it then became a reality that
that could be a potential.

436
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:32,404
My first day in Houston
was Sally Ride's last day
in Houston.

437
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:37,142
And to meet her, to meet one
your role models who literally

438
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:40,846
had opened those doors that had
previously been closed to women

439
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:45,116
was quite astounding.

440
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,019
Kathy Sullivan, the first
female to do an EVA.

441
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:51,356
There are so many in that
first group of women astronauts

442
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:56,361
that you look up to and
say, "this is something
I can do now."

443
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:59,731
Cady Coleman was selected
as an astronaut in 1992.

444
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:03,435
Today, she's NASA's Senior
Astronaut with flights on

445
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:04,636
two Space Shuttle missions

446
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,806
and an expedition to the
International Space Station.

447
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,978
It's become
clear to me in
recent years
that there's a

448
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:17,415
perspective that
everybody brings
that comes from
their diversity.

449
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:21,052
If you can see it,
you can be it.

450
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:26,458
And if you don't see it, then it
just might not occur to you.

451
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:30,295
That the importance of
actually on film.

452
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:33,932
On TV, in a book, in an
advertisement,

453
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:38,036
seeing somebody that you can
identify with.

454
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:41,840
Probably that looks a little bit
like you... the value of that

455
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:46,144
cannot be over stated in that
you see somebody like that

456
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,380
and you think that
maybe I could do this.

457
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,248
During three decades of
shuttle missions,

458
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,918
49 women would fly into space.

459
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:55,654
Astronauts would include people
of every ethnicity,

460
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:59,024
including flyers from 16
different nations.

461
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,393
As each shuttle hurtled
into space,

462
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:05,163
everyone could look skyward and
know "they were flying for me."

463
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,760
Three, two, one.

464
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:39,364
We have SRB ignition and the
history's largest astronaut crew

465
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:40,932
is on it's way.

466
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:44,603
In the early 80's, NASA was on
a roll as three more orbiters

467
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,438
joined Columbia in the
shuttle fleet.

468
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:50,375
With Challenger, Discovery, and
Atlantis added to the rotation,

469
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:54,312
the space agency launched 24
successful missions in the first

470
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,514
five years of the
shuttle program.

471
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:00,885
The 25th mission would
end in tragedy.

472
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:03,154
We have main engine start.

473
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:08,493
Four, three, two, one
and lift off.

474
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:12,030
Lift off of the 25th
Space Shuttle mission
and it has

475
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,698
cleared the tower.

476
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,967
Challenger, go with throttle up.

477
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,435
Roger, go with throttle up.

478
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:25,310
In 15 seconds, velocity
2,900 feet per second,

479
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:28,780
altitude 9 nautical miles,
down range distance seven
nautical miles.

480
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,916
The Challenger accident
in 1986 would set the
shuttle program

481
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,918
back for over 2 years.

482
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,720
Make sure you maintain
all your data.

483
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,822
Start pulling it together.

484
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,559
For Hoot Gibson and Rhea
Seddon, the first astronauts
to marry,

485
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,695
the loss would be very personal.

486
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:46,164
My second mission which
was aboard Columbia,

487
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:54,197
launched on January, 12th of
1986 and we landed on
January 18th of 1986.

488
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:59,544
We were at a real
high point at that time.

489
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:03,982
Just ten days later, January
28th was when we lost the

490
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,752
Space Shuttle Challenger
and lost the entire crew.

491
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:11,322
We had all turned on the
television to watch it even in

492
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:16,695
our training session because
all of us liked to watch our
friends get to fly.

493
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:21,032
And when the explosion
happened, you know,

494
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,702
everybody thought, the boosters
came off too soon.

495
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,437
Where did the boosters go?
What happened?

496
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,473
The shuttle's still out there
flying on it's main engines and

497
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:31,776
as we began to see things
fall into the ocean,

498
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,311
we realized that they were gone.

499
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,924
Flight controllers here
looking very carefully at
the situation.

500
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,750
Obviously, a major malfunction.

501
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:43,088
You know, there were so many
close friends on that flight.

502
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,890
A number of them
had been in our class.

503
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:51,162
It was the first time in
my adult life that I
had friends die.

504
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:54,966
To have so many of them die at
the same time and to watch it

505
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:59,003
was just incredibly,
incredibly sad.

506
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:02,307
We learned an awful
lot of very difficult,

507
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,276
very painful lessons with
Challenger.

508
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:09,114
I will never forget being on top
of the world when I finished my

509
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:12,383
second space flight which
was my first flight as
Mission Commander

510
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:16,287
and in the space of just
10 days dropping down

511
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:19,491
into the deepest darkest hole
you could ever imagine.

512
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:22,694
Challenger hit close to home
for me because my husband

513
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,929
had just landed from
his second flight.

514
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:28,166
And I remembered standing
on the roof of the launch
control center

515
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:31,169
where families watched
launches and it was incredibly

516
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:34,139
incredibly cold when
they launched.

517
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:37,342
Some of those mornings where
almost as cold as that morning

518
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:39,744
when the Challenger launched.

519
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,815
And to me to realize that that
could have been my husband.

520
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:49,087
I always was more afraid
when Hoot flew.

521
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,626
More afraid that I was
going to be the spouse that
was left behind.

522
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:59,764
The goal of frequent access
to space now seemed like

523
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,599
an elusive dream for NASA.

524
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,903
The failure of a solid rocket
booster "o" ring in cold weather

525
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:08,373
caused the agency and the space
industry to re-tool every

526
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:11,376
procedure in the shuttle
program from bottom up.

527
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,454
When the shuttle returned
to flight with discovery in

528
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:17,448
September, 1988, the outlook
for the program was changing...

529
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,585
After I left the shuttle
was severely curtailed.

530
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,021
It was not going
to be the system
that people

531
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:25,490
thought it was
before the
accident.

532
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:31,229
A lot of the customers
that we had went onto
different launch vehicles

533
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:35,500
so the content of what we
were going to do changed

534
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:37,202
and diminished frankly.

535
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:41,272
And then the shuttle come back
flying but basically was there

536
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,775
to support NASA's
programs itself.

537
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,846
With commercial
satellites and defense
payloads going elsewhere,

538
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,448
nasa was under
pressure to deliver science

539
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:54,686
and the deployment of the hubble
telescope by sts-31 seemed like

540
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,721
just the thing in 1990.

541
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:59,290
Hubble's mirrors were
nearsighted though

542
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,426
and challenger's
replacement, endeavour,

543
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,429
was sent to fix it in 1993.

544
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:07,131
We lost Mars observer on
our way to Mars,

545
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,800
unmanned probe.

546
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:12,203
So NASA, collectively
manned and unmanned,

547
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:17,275
we were a bit in the
doghouse at that time.

548
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:21,446
The December that we flew the
repair mission STS-61,

549
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:24,249
I got back to my office and
there was a single sheet of

550
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:28,119
paper laying on my desk and
it was a copy out of the

551
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:30,421
Congressional record.

552
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:36,194
And that page basically said
NASA if you are unable to

553
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:41,499
accomplish this repair mission
then be aware that your future

554
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:45,270
in funding is going
to be in jeopardy.

555
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,940
That was probably the
first time that I paused
and thought to myself,

556
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:50,441
holy cow.

557
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:54,245
A veteran crew that
featured 36 grueling hours
of spacewalks by

558
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,781
Kathryn Thornton, Tom Akers,
Jeff Hoffman,

559
00:31:56,814 --> 00:32:00,885
and Story Musgrave saved Hubble
from being a monumental failure.

560
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,887
That's the way I was
beating the drum.

561
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,090
I wanted to keep the cadence up
and the very first spacewalk

562
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:08,793
we did we had some problems
closing some doors.

563
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:13,665
We overcame that because Story
Musgrave basically had this idea

564
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:19,470
that I thought was excellent and
the team on the ground here,

565
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:22,106
the collective team, was a
little bit nervous about it but

566
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,677
I'm thinking to myself Story
knows what the hell he's doing

567
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,245
he's not going to hurt anything.

568
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,447
And so as a flight director I
had the...

569
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,281
it's easy.

570
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,750
I gave the go for
him to do that.

571
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,218
And we stayed on the timeline.

572
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:38,222
The thing that I enjoy the
most as a lead flight
director on that

573
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:41,926
flight is that as we
accomplished things
in the mission

574
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,196
I noticed looking around
the room that initially there

575
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:53,104
were a lot of tense, locked
jaws no smiles, peoples
heads down working.

576
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:57,241
But as we were doing the mission
occasionally you would see

577
00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:01,612
someone grin at you after
we did something,

578
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,081
accomplished something.

579
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,359
And we have to say that
through your superb efforts
you have

580
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:09,287
really shown that NASA can
do all that we promise to
do and more.

581
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,825
And those grins just
kept coming.

582
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:17,996
The EVA's of STS-61 proved
that humans could work and adapt

583
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,365
in space better than
anyone could imagine.

584
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:23,501
The mission laid the groundwork
for much of NASA's future and

585
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,770
four subsequent service
missions to Hubble,

586
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:29,707
making the telescope one of the
shuttle's greatest achievements.

587
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:34,512
I selected Hubble
because, again it's this
icon of not only the

588
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,581
shuttle program but
for all of NASA.

589
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:40,318
An army helicopter pilot,
Nancy Currie grappled Hubble
with the

590
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:44,722
shuttle's robotic arm on
STS-109 in 2002.

591
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:45,690
Currie now moving in for

592
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,925
the grapple of the
Hubble Space Telescope.

593
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,560
Grapple confirmed.

594
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:52,330
My saying was if I don't
grapple it you guys don't

595
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,500
get to do an EVA so lets
take first things first.

596
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:59,470
And seeing this giant
spacecraft come right up
beside me and

597
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:03,207
Nancy reached up,
grabbed it, stacked
it in the back and

598
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:06,677
we climbed all
over it like ants
for about a week
and fixed it.

599
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:10,548
Linnehan's spacewalking
partner was Hubble
veteran John Grunsfeld,

600
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:13,551
who serviced
the telescope in three
separate missions...

601
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:18,890
It was this
combination of
humans extending
our reach to

602
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:22,627
fix the telescope to allow us to
use Hubble to look back to the

603
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,671
beginning of the universe and
everything in between.

604
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:27,799
And each time the Space Shuttle
went back to Hubble,

605
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:31,769
installed new instruments, made
new upgrades over a series of

606
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:35,606
four flights, really transformed
our view of the universe,

607
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,842
our view of ourselves
where we came from.

608
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:43,014
And set the story of the
Space Shuttle as this
remarkable machine.

609
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:46,284
The Space Shuttle pushed its
performance limits to service

610
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:49,887
the Hubble and its crews
knew they were taking
greater risks...

611
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,357
The shuttle has only the
capability to go about 350

612
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:56,828
maybe a little bit more
nautical miles up and
then come back again.

613
00:34:56,861 --> 00:35:00,565
And so when we come back
we literally have just enough
fuel left in our tanks,

614
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,733
we burn into exhaustion
to get home.

615
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,336
So if things don't go
exactly right,

616
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,072
we may not come home from a
Hubble mission and that's always

617
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,976
been one of the reasons it's
considered a bit more dangerous

618
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,411
that other shuttle missions.

619
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,814
But the risks were worth it to
add to the Hubble's legacy...

620
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:21,018
The most prolific and important
scientific instrument ever built

621
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,688
by man is the Hubble
Space Telescope.

622
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,324
It's produced more science,
more PHD's,

623
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:30,361
more knowledge about the
universe in terms of who we are

624
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:34,499
and where we are in the universe
than anything we've ever done.

625
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:38,035
John Grunsfeld recalls saying
goodbye to Hubble in 2009

626
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:42,106
after his 8th EVA to repair and
upgrade the telescope...

627
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,676
Coming into the airlock at the
end of that fifth EVA I thought

628
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,346
I can't believe that we actually
accomplished everything

629
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,348
we set out to do and
a little bit more.

630
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:54,252
The next day we put the Hubble
on the end of the robotic arm.

631
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:57,822
3,2,1 release.

632
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,390
Let go. Backed away.

633
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,993
And over the course of an orbit
saw Hubble drift away.

634
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:06,497
And I wasn't sad I was actually
really happy that we'd given

635
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:11,202
Hubble the best opportunity to
have a long observant career
ahead of it.

636
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:14,739
But I'm still thrilled that
we were about to give
Hubble a long life.

637
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,611
The legacy of the
Space Shuttle program,

638
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:24,949
I think when folks look back
hundreds of years from now,

639
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:29,020
will be the launch and servicing
of the Hubble Space Telescope.

640
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:32,156
It has given us such an
incredible view of the universe.

641
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,793
It's opened our eyes to the
wonders and beauty of the

642
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:39,363
universe in a way that I think
will never be equalled.

643
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:42,466
And it was only through the
ability to go up and grab the

644
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,835
Hubble and send people
out, like myself,

645
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:48,339
in space suits to put new
instruments in that allowed us

646
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,775
to have these incredible views.

647
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:55,313
When I grew up I was a
Trekkie, Star Trek, what
kid wasn't.

648
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,847
And I just wanted to
be an astronaut.

649
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,451
But there was a couple episodes
there where they're flying

650
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,987
through giant amebas and there's
these colors and all these

651
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,190
beautiful things and I go,
It's beautiful but it can't
look like that.

652
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,335
Well you know what, when we got
those Hubble pictures back,

653
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,994
it does look like that.

654
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:13,197
It's like it's almost how do you
determine where art and science

655
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,867
you know, stop or blend
together.

656
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,870
That's the magic thing about
Hubble and the Space Shuttle

657
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,072
in terms of what it's done.

658
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,630
America's heartland... a small
town in Nebraska is home to

659
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,765
astronaut Clayton Anderson.

660
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:50,801
His journey to becoming an
astronaut was a long one.

661
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:55,673
His career at Johnson Space
Center began as a college
intern in 1981

662
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,776
and it would be 17 years
before NASA would select him

663
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,311
as an astronaut.

664
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:03,748
Five years later, he was still
waiting for a flight assignment.

665
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:07,985
His job on February 1, 2003 was
to support the families of the

666
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:12,056
crew during the routine return
of STS-107 to Cape Canaveral.

667
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:16,294
I was intimately
involved in that
entire mission so
much so

668
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,530
that on the
landing day, I
was at the cape
near the shuttle

669
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,666
landing facility playing
with the kids,

670
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:26,370
tossing freebies in the grass,
waiting for Colombia to re-enter

671
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,739
and land at the
Kennedy Space Center.

672
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:31,175
For the seven person crew
aboard Columbia,

673
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:35,946
the mood was light and
re-entry into the earth's
atmosphere seemed routine.

674
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,315
This is amazing.

675
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,350
It's really getting really
bright out there.

676
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:42,019
Yea, you definitely don't want
to be out there now.

677
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:47,358
Minutes later, there were
signs the landing wasn't
routine, however.

678
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:50,227
Milt Heflin, now chief of
flight directors,

679
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,596
was watching from
mission control.

680
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:58,636
I was sitting in the viewing
room, behind the control team
and mission control

681
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,172
that saturday morning with
Ron Epps,

682
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:04,575
one of the Division
Chiefs and The Flat
Operations
Organization.

683
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:09,580
He and I were just
talking sports and
other stuff.

684
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:13,984
As the order was coming across
the states and the team was at

685
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,455
that point when it got close to
the central part of the states,

686
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:23,327
and over Texas and they're
making the calls to the crew,

687
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:27,598
I began to sense something
just didn't feel right

688
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:30,534
looking at the display and
the track and so forth.

689
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:33,037
I had to turn to the
grand stand where all the
families were

690
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,539
standing up wondering now,
what's going on here?

691
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:36,574
The clocks continuing.

692
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,642
We don't see or hear anything.

693
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:41,412
John Shannon, one of my flight
directors, who was serving

694
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:44,749
behind the flight director as
the missions ops. director.

695
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:47,051
John, at one point got up,
reached int he book case,

696
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:51,822
grabbed a big white binder,
headed to the door.

697
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:55,893
At that time, I knew that
this was not good.

698
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,862
Columbia, Houston Comm. check...

699
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:05,970
Columbia, Houston UHF
Comm check...

700
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:09,240
Columbia, Houston UHF
Comm. check...

701
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:14,545
He walked behind me and I
said, "John, What's happening?"

702
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,281
And his words to me were,
"We lost them."

703
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,322
When Columbia entered the
atmosphere,

704
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,859
it disintegrated with pieces
falling over east Texas and

705
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,361
neighboring states.

706
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:33,464
Eventually, Col. Cabanna
came down and stood in
front of the families

707
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:36,133
and told them there is no hope.

708
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,268
We've lost the crew.

709
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:42,540
Man, the screams and sobbing,
it was just horrible.

710
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:46,277
I've been here for all three
tragedies that we've had.

711
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:50,181
The Apollo 1 fire, Lost the
Challenger. Lost Columbia,

712
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:54,718
but this one really
happened on my watch.

713
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:57,588
That's been something I
think about everyday.

714
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:03,394
The loss of the Orbiter
Columbia set back NASA
another 2 years

715
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,429
as it developed new safety
procedures to look for

716
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,966
thermal tiles damaged by
foam strikes during launch.

717
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,101
It was the beginning of
the end of the shuttle,

718
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,770
but it had a mission
to complete...

719
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:16,807
A mission that began in the
decade prior to the
Columbia disaster.

720
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:22,012
STS-60 in 1994 was the dawn of a
new era of cooperation between

721
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:25,649
NASA and the Russian space
agency when Sergei Krikalev

722
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,285
became the first cosmonaut
to fly on a shuttle.

723
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,988
This mission and a series of
shuttle flights docking with

724
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:34,258
the Russian space station Mir
would lay the groundwork for

725
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:36,861
the International Space Station.

726
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,996
Congratulations Space
Shuttle Atlantis,

727
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,564
space station Mir.

728
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:44,001
After twenty years, our
space craft, our dock
can orbit again.

729
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:46,403
I was asked to go back to
Houston and fly one more

730
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:50,207
shuttle mission,
and become the
commander for what
was going

731
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,443
to be the
first joint
Russian/American
shuttle mission.

732
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,278
And as a marine, I said
forget it.

733
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:55,846
You got the wrong guy.

734
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,682
I have no desire to fly
with any Russians.

735
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,594
My boss at the time said,
"Hey, there are two of them

736
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:01,785
who are going to be in town."

737
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,955
A guy named Sergei Krikalev,
whom I ended up flying with,

738
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,858
and Vladimir Tehtoff, who
eventually became his backup,

739
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,803
but they were the two
candidates to fly the first

740
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,328
joint Russian/American mission.

741
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,106
And I went and had dinner
with them that night,

742
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,467
and it was just an absolutely
incredible experience where we'd

743
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,869
talked about our families,
we talked about our kids.

744
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,704
We talked about our
hopes for the future,

745
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:23,440
and the way we wanted to
bring our nations together,

746
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:27,845
and I was reminded one more time
what my mom and dad had

747
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:30,314
taught me, was that all
people are the same.

748
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:33,017
Today, they are among
my best friends.

749
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,720
Krikalev would return to space
in Endeavour in 1998 to begin

750
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,557
the assembly of the
International Space Station.

751
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,393
Nancy Currie remembers joining
the American Unity Module

752
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:44,495
with the Russian Zarya.

753
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,363
To literally lay
the corner stone,

754
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:50,267
was pretty
overwhelming and
humbling for me.

755
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,670
You know, not many people go
to work when there's literally

756
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,748
millions of people looking over
their shoulder saying,

757
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:58,008
sort of don't screw this up.

758
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:01,845
The first mission involved
grappling that free flyer,

759
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:04,615
the Russian Zarya, that had
launched two weeks prior to our

760
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:06,250
mission unmanned..

761
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:11,021
You know, grabbing it with the
robotic arm and then mating it
to the U.S. node.

762
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:14,525
Houston endeavor, we
have Zarya firmly attached
to the orbiter,

763
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:16,026
and we're half way home
for the day.

764
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:20,631
Jerry Ross, the first
astronaut to fly 7 shuttle
missions and

765
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:25,569
perform 9 spacewalks, spent over
21 hours in space attaching the

766
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,138
hardware of the ISS
building blocks.

767
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:31,408
In many ways,
the International
Space Station is
one of the

768
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,777
crowning
achievements of
the Space Shuttle.

769
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:36,814
It was supremely adapted and
suited for that type of work;

770
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:39,583
to carry large components
into space and to carry the

771
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,919
crew members that were to
do the assembly of them.

772
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,530
And to be on the crew that
completed the first

773
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:46,824
three space walks, to basically
lay the cornerstone of

774
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,393
The International Space Station,
was an incredible honor.

775
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:52,529
Each subsequent flight added
more pieces to the growing

776
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:54,198
mammoth in orbit.

777
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:58,535
STS-92 delivered the Z1 Truss
for the first solar arrays and

778
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:01,872
Michael Lopez-Alegria made the
first of his record-setting

779
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:04,341
10 spacewalks in 2000.

780
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,485
One of the greatest legacies

781
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:07,077
of the space station is the

782
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,013
international cooperation that

783
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:10,547
was required to pull it off,

784
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:11,949
and it continues even today.

785
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,351
When you think about these
modules coming together,

786
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:17,888
that were designed using
different measuring systems,

787
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:20,424
and even different
alphabets in many cases.

788
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:23,594
The fact that it worked
was not trivial,

789
00:44:23,627 --> 00:44:28,232
but that extra effort has led
to a lot of benefit for the

790
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:29,833
whole world community.

791
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:34,672
Being a part of the ISS
program actually fulfilled
some of the dreams

792
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:37,508
I had as a child
where I looked and
I thought,

793
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:40,778
imagine what it'd
be like to launch
off the planet and

794
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:43,380
rendezvous and dock with
something in space.

795
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:48,619
So, when we were there on
STS-92, there was no
permanent crew onboard.

796
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:52,122
In fact, the first permanent
crew was going to launch a
week after we landed.

797
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:54,958
So when we got there, there
wasn't anybody home.

798
00:44:54,992 --> 00:45:00,264
In fact, I slept in it by myself
one night with my daughters
teddy bear.

799
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:04,268
That's probably the answer to a
trivia question, right?

800
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:07,171
Who's the only person to
have slept alone in the
Space Station?

801
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,707
Crews that flew later shuttle
missions since the return to

802
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,476
flight after Columbia,
witnessed the completion

803
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:15,479
of the International
Space Station.

804
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:18,749
The space
Station itself
looked like a tiny
bug, actually.

805
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:20,684
A little golden bug
in the distance.

806
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:24,221
Then as it blooms, really in our
windows as we approach it,

807
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:25,956
we see all the fine detail.

808
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:30,060
You see the incarnation of some
group of peoples audacity

809
00:45:30,094 --> 00:45:32,329
to think that we could even
do something like this.

810
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,565
Something that's almost
two-acres in size,

811
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:36,233
the most complex machine
ever built,

812
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:40,170
gleaming in gold, in all
it's glory just right
there in front of you

813
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:44,074
and actually you're about to run
into it in a controlled docking

814
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,243
On the first
mission, we
brought the
S0 Truss,

815
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:48,946
which was the central
portion of the truss up
to the space station.

816
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:51,982
At that point, the space
station seemed big,

817
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:54,885
but by comparison on
my final two missions,

818
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,988
it was small in comparison
because it just kept growing
and growing.

819
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,990
And then we you approach it
on the final mission,

820
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:01,401
when I saw it just as an
assembly completed.

821
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,594
Just a magnificent facility.

822
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,662
The completion of the
International Space Station

823
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:08,732
fulfilled the goal of the
shuttle program to make space

824
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,868
a workable and livable place.

825
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:14,671
The astronauts who flew on the
shuttle and walked in space

826
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,740
achieved that dream.

827
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,710
Their unique experience of the
universe remains a legacy of

828
00:46:19,743 --> 00:46:21,345
the shuttle program.

829
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:25,182
The most
memorable
experiences are
doing spacewalks.

830
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:27,484
When you open the
hatch, and you
look outside.

831
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:30,554
The hatch faces down
toward the earth,

832
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:33,290
and so you're sort of leaning
over the edge and you're
looking down.

833
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:39,129
And it's as if this magic sea
two hundred miles away is going

834
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:41,698
beneath you and there are
clouds, and maybe the ocean,

835
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:45,035
or maybe land and it almost
seems unreal.

836
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:48,338
And then when you go out,
everything is vivid.

837
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:52,910
There's no air, there's no dust,
in your entire visual field,

838
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:54,845
you see the grandeur of space.

839
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,883
What struck me was, again the
clarity and the beauty beyond

840
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,386
anything you can see even
with a High Def TV.

841
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:06,123
Two hundred and fifty
miles up and really
feeling that distance,

842
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,792
and having it just
kind of glide beneath you,

843
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,928
but in complete silence.

844
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:13,130
All you can hear is your fan
inside your spacesuit.

845
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,533
The occasional comment inside
your comm cap,

846
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,335
but other than that it's
complete silence.

847
00:47:18,368 --> 00:47:21,939
My last Space Shuttle
flight was STS-110.

848
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:24,875
I had an opportunity at the end
of the space walk to be on the

849
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:26,543
end of the robotic arm.

850
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:29,479
And during that
trip, I watched
the sun set in
the west,

851
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,282
down the Mediterranean.

852
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:35,686
I watched as we came across
Northern Africa on one side,

853
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,387
and Europe on the other side.

854
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:40,791
As we got closer to Israel
and that area,

855
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:43,393
it was starting to
turn to nighttime,

856
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:45,729
and you could start to see
thunderstorms below with

857
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:48,198
lightening strikes going off
all over the place.

858
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:51,235
And I can remember going
right past the tail of
the Space Shuttle

859
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,804
at night and almost could
reach out and touch it.

860
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:55,782
And I could look down into
the Payload bay and see

861
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:56,974
the lights of the Payload bay

862
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,042
and the windows up in the
crew compartment.

863
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:01,054
And that's about the time that
the sun come back up,

864
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:04,114
and I could see this glorious
bathing of the space station

865
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:08,385
hardware in these beautiful
colors of pinks and reds and

866
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:10,721
oranges and ultimately the
whites as the sun came up

867
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:13,657
in a very fast fashion
as it does on orbit.

868
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:16,793
While flying with Jerry, who
had so much experience,

869
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:18,262
was just a real treat.

870
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:22,099
One of the best pieces of advise
was to really burn some pictures

871
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:23,267
into your memory.

872
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,411
Every once in a while, I would
try to look out and say,

873
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:26,870
ok now I remember this.

874
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:30,641
I remember being out in one of
my EVAs and seeing the sun rise

875
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:32,876
over the horizon, you could
see this incredible blue

876
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,745
right above the
rim of the earth.

877
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:39,850
Or looking down at the gulf of
California and down by Mexico,

878
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:41,661
and you could see all of the
coast of California thinking,

879
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,630
I need to remember this.
It's just an amazing sight.

880
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:48,158
On my third Space Shuttle
flight, STS-37,

881
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,894
it was at night, and the
three crew members inside

882
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:53,373
told me to take a break because
they were concentrating on doing

883
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:56,633
some things with my spacewalking
buddy out there J. Epp.

884
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:58,602
So I turned off my
helmet motor lights.

885
00:48:58,635 --> 00:48:59,836
"Here we go."

886
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,572
I just kind of leaned back, and
I was looking at the universe

887
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,074
just enjoying it.

888
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,977
Not really thinking about much
else other than trying to soak
it all in.

889
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,414
When all of a sudden,
I had this feeling,

890
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:14,851
this emotion come over me that I
was at unity with the universe.

891
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,119
"It's a great ride."

892
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,164
I really did have a sensation
that I was doing exactly what

893
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,190
God had designed me to do.

894
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:22,359
I was out there using my hands
to fix things,

895
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:26,663
my brain to work on
things, and that to me was
a real epiphany moment

896
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:29,833
or a real confirming moment that
I had made the right decisions

897
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:32,302
or followed the right
guidance from God

898
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:34,838
throughout my life and
throughout my career,

899
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:36,373
to get me to that point.

900
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,579
By making space our home,
the Space Shuttle and the

901
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,615
International Space Station have
set the stage for a new

902
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:50,153
generation of astronauts to take
our next steps in space.

903
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:52,289
I think this is
a great time to be
a part of it,

904
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,157
because we're at
a transitional
phase.

905
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:59,296
So, being at that
transition is kind
of like an
opportune moment

906
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,399
because you're like there on
the ground floor when there's

907
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,701
a huge change that's
about to take place.

908
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:11,541
There's a huge future beyond
the Space Shuttle for space
exploration.

909
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:14,511
And that includes learning
as much as we can from

910
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:16,046
The International Space Station.

911
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,715
Taking all of that knowledge and
potentially taking it to

912
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:23,854
grappling an asteroid, bring it
back to our location and
exploit it.

913
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:27,691
Or maybe going back to the
moon and hopefully going to
Mars one day.

914
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:32,496
Developing the technology and
engineers for our future in

915
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,298
space is a mission for
universities like the

916
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,768
Georgia Institute of Technology,
which has produced

917
00:50:37,801 --> 00:50:40,270
over a dozen astronauts
and thousands of workers

918
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:42,272
in the aerospace industry.

919
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:46,276
Georgia Tech is helping land
robotic rovers on Mars
today...

920
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,445
And more in coming years.

921
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:51,081
The work that is going on
in my lab, for instance,

922
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:54,551
related to entry, decent
landing technologies.

923
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:58,355
We're not just
working on the
missions that are
flying right now,

924
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,158
we're developing
technologies for those missions

925
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:04,227
that will fly a decade or
more from now.

926
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:07,564
In my lab right now, I have
students working on technologies

927
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:11,902
that will one day enable us
to land humans on Mars.

928
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:15,705
They become experts in those
systems and then they go to a

929
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:20,010
place like NASA Langley Research
Center or Johnson Space Center,

930
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:23,246
The Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, and they take
those ideas that they

931
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,350
started on here at tech and they
mature them into real systems

932
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:30,187
and they actually get to
fly and operate them.

933
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,589
The foundation needed for
deep space missions like a

934
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:35,325
Mars expedition was built
by the Space Shuttle,

935
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:40,063
the workhorse that carried
the heavy payloads which
is ISS today.

936
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,333
The Space Shuttle might have
been the most visible symbol of

937
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:49,873
human space flight, but NASA's
human space flight program
remains strong.

938
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:52,142
And the center piece of the
human space flight program

939
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:54,911
today, is the International
Space Station.

940
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,014
What NASA's doing now, along
with American industry,

941
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:01,618
is we're building the tools and
capabilities that the systems

942
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:05,589
that will take humans out
beyond low earth orbit.

943
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:11,895
Out to new destinations,
out into deep space really
for the first time.

944
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:14,631
Perhaps back to the moon,
but you know,

945
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:17,000
my dream is that we
don't stop there.

946
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:18,802
My dream is that we go
all the way to Mars.

947
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:33,450
For future space explorers

948
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,886
destined to colonize
the Moon or Mars,

949
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,188
the Space Shuttle will
continue to be a symbol

950
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:40,524
of America's space program...

951
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,993
Every time a child, it's
really precious,

952
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:46,263
a child draws a spaceship for
us and sends it to us,

953
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:50,233
every single time, it's in the
shape of a Space Shuttle.

954
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:53,503
That image, the silhouette
of the Space Shuttle,

955
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:59,342
it's shape is an iconic image
that I think is going to last
for generations.

956
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:01,111
"Apollo, How's it going?"

957
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:01,811
"How are you?"

958
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,146
"Good, nice to see you again.

959
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,081
Welcome!"

960
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:10,754
The pure number of astronauts
the Space Shuttle Program

961
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:15,625
brought to space
have made a
difference for
humanity,

962
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:18,361
because so many
people can look
out;

963
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:21,431
can see a movie, a video,
an advertisement,

964
00:53:21,464 --> 00:53:25,001
a something, somebody can tell
them a story about somebody

965
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:28,905
kind of like them that
got to go to space.

966
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,874
And it doesn't mean they're
going to go to space,

967
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:33,643
but it means that something that
they thought was amazing and

968
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:35,779
could only happen to a special
person,

969
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:38,048
happened to a real person.

970
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:41,384
And that the special thing, the
special passion that they have,

971
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:44,854
that passion is
possible as well.

972
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:49,392
Space Shuttle, that program
did that for all of us.

973
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,596
Clayton Anderson first dreamed
of being an astronaut

974
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:54,331
when he was six years old.

975
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:58,401
In 2007, his dream became
a reality when he
launched into space

976
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:04,841
on STS-117 and spent 152
days on the International
Space Station.

977
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:07,811
It was an emotional moment
when he framed a photograph

978
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:09,679
of his boyhood home...

979
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:13,516
When I figured out where I was,
and I saw Omaha and Lincoln,

980
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:17,287
and my eyes localized in on my
hometown of Ashland, Nebraska,

981
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,655
I couldn't take a picture.

982
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:19,856
I was crying.

983
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:24,227
All I could think about was, I
was born and raised there,

984
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:28,798
and here I am two hundred
and twenty-five miles
above that spot

985
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:31,101
floating in space
in zero gravity,

986
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:34,938
and living the dream that I
had dreamed since I was a
six year old kid.

987
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:38,275
And I didn't need a
picture that day.

988
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:43,680
I just needed that experience
that told me that that's
where I belong.

989
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:47,517
Engine start.

990
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,853
..., and we are clear the tower.

991
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:53,923
Anderson returned to ISS on
discovery as the shuttle program

992
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,394
began to wind down in 2010.

993
00:54:57,427 --> 00:55:01,131
When the spacewalks were
over and most of our job
was complete,

994
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:03,199
then I began to get
very nostalgic.

995
00:55:03,233 --> 00:55:04,367
I felt sad.

996
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:05,969
I wanted to stay longer.

997
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:09,539
So to leave that place and close
the hatch the last day,

998
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:11,675
and get back in Discovery...

999
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,810
Discovery departing.

1000
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:15,412
That was pretty tough for me.

1001
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:18,648
Not knowing if you were ever
going to get back to that place,

1002
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:21,651
and that's a very special place.

1003
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:24,754
Now that the program is over,
Anderson speaks for everyone

1004
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:26,656
who misses the Space Shuttle.

1005
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:29,359
The shuttles no longer
soar into the heavens,

1006
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:33,530
but America's heart
remains in space.

1007
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:38,101
Having the privilege to live
and work on board a shuttle

1008
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:42,706
and space station is
the ultimate for me.

1009
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:46,076
When I was seeing it come
to an end, it was very
difficult to grasp.

1010
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:48,712
So. I'm honored that I
had that privilege.

1011
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:52,048
I'm honored that I was able to
serve my country in that way.

1012
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:54,784
And absolutely my heart
is still there, yeah.

1013
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:57,420
I think once an astronaut,
always an astronaut.

1014
00:55:57,454 --> 00:56:01,591
And if they called me tomorrow
and asked me to go again,

1015
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:04,060
I would probably say yes.

1016
00:56:04,084 --> 00:56:07,084
