00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:24,192
(Calm instrumental music)

2
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:01,462
(Calm instrumental music)

3
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:20,721
(Ocean waves)

4
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:29,697
(Children playing)

5
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:38,972
[Rey] Hey.

6
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:45,813
[Hazel] (foreign language)

7
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:52,520
(Crowd talking loudly)

8
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,887
[Man without cap]
(foreign language)

00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:58,258
[Man with blue cap]
(foreign language)

10
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:02,329
(People speaking far away)

11
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,065
(Crowd speaking
foreign language)

12
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,634
(Audrey screams)

13
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:10,070
(Crowd speaking
foreign language)

14
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,043
[Audrey] What do you want?

15
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,878
(Crowd speaking
foreign language)

16
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:18,579
[Hazel] Excuse me, excuse me.

17
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,781
Hey, hey.

18
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,151
What's your name?

19
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:26,887
My name is...

20
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:29,923
Audrey.

21
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,226
I'm here on vacation,

22
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,496
I'm visiting.

23
00:06:35,496 --> 00:06:39,667
(Ballad music playing far away)

24
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:44,237
So, I landed right here

25
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,107
And I've been hitchhiking
for about two days.

26
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,809
I want to get here,
so where am I now?

27
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:51,712
Damn!

28
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:56,216
I'm gonna need a guide,

29
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:58,452
Somebody who is bilingual.

30
00:06:58,452 --> 00:06:59,086
[Hazel] I know
someone that...???

31
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,053
How about you?

32
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,724
No, I can't.

33
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,092
But I know someone who
would be perfect.

34
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:10,898
(Ballad music)

35
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:17,838
(Ocean waves)

36
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:26,514
[Hazel] Hey, Nick!

37
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,554
[Nick] Nick is listening.

38
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:34,988
[Hazel] This is Audrey.

39
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,089
Hello, Audrey.

40
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,527
She's looking for someone
to go on a trip with her.

41
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,362
That's terrific.

42
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:43,564
As a guide,

43
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,265
And I recommended you.

44
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,667
[Nick] Um, no.

45
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,468
I'm writing something
very important

46
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,503
And it's due yesterday.

47
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,738
Nick!

48
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,741
Why don't you
ask Tomas, Hazel?

49
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,010
I don't speak to him anymore

50
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,746
And she also needs a guide
that speaks English.

51
00:07:58,746 --> 00:07:59,747
It's kind of the
clincher, actually.

52
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,950
She seems to speak it
pretty well herself.

53
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,553
Nick, turn around.

54
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,759
[Nick] Oh, fuck no.

55
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,426
What's wrong?

56
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,595
I don't bite.

57
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,263
Keep on walking, people.

58
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,706
My mom will have
dinner in an hour, Nick.

59
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:28,275
[Nick] Hazel.

60
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:33,013
You say that she needs a guide.

61
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,147
Yeah.

62
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:36,950
So she'll be leaving soon.

63
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,451
Yeah.

64
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,820
Good.

65
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:45,292
(Ocean waves)

66
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,599
(Luggage being pulled)

67
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,766
[Rey] Hey, Nick.

68
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:53,567
What is that?

69
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,268
[Nick] Oh, it's heavy.

70
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,605
(Mumbling)

71
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:58,972
[Hazel's mom]
(foreign language)

72
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,308
[Nick] What are
you doing here?

73
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:02,309
[Hazel's mom] Audrey.

74
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,543
[Audrey] What am I doing here?

75
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,144
[Hazel's mom] This is Nick.

76
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,545
Our other guest.

77
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,782
[Audrey] Oh, great. We've met.

78
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,818
Good, good.

79
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:13,854
Now you two can talk
about America things.

80
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,730
We can talk about
American things.

81
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,866
Cheeseburgers, capitalism.

82
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:30,137
I'm glad we had
this conversation.

83
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,849
[Hazel's mom] You can stay
as long as you need to.

84
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:44,618
You are a good house guest.

85
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:45,919
Like Nick.

86
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,822
We have two good house guest.

87
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,691
How is work going, Nick?

88
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:51,524
Brilliantly.

89
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,193
(Audrey laughs)

90
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,228
I'd say I'm back on top

91
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:56,596
If it weren't for the fact
that it was due yesterday.

92
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,298
You said that, yesterday.

93
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:00,801
I'm dating Rey Aquino.

94
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,874
[Hazel's mom]
(foreign language)

95
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:08,575
I can't take it
back, it's true.

96
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:10,978
(Foreign language)

97
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:13,113
[Hazel] Oh mom, really?

98
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,481
[Nick] You know,
Hazel's a big girl.

99
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,750
I think she can make
decisions on her own.

100
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,184
And Rey's not a...
[Hazel's mom] Audrey.

101
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,686
Nick.

102
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:20,888
Leave the table now.

103
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:30,597
(Instrumental music)

104
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:34,201
(Window knocking)

105
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:40,841
(Instrumental music)

106
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,337
[Nick] What do you want?

107
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,539
[Audrey] Can I
come in for a bit?

108
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,841
I'm writing right now

109
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,909
And it's very important

110
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,045
And I'm supposed to
send it in yesterday.

111
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:19,880
[Audrey] Rey just came
in through Hazel's window.

112
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,516
It's kinda awkward.

113
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,317
Come in.

114
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:39,266
(Book pages turning)

115
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,373
So, are you on vacation?

116
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,941
Why?

117
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,977
Come to see the exotic sights?

118
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,282
Shouldn't you be writing?

119
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,584
I should, but it's not
that easy, you know.

120
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:00,153
I can't just turn it on and off.

121
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:03,590
Come with me.

122
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,358
Oh, not this again.

123
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,127
[Audrey] I can tell
you're not happy.

124
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:07,995
I could have told you that.

125
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:12,900
Have you heard the
legend of the Diwata?

126
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,034
I don't listen to death metal.

127
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,268
[Audrey] It's about
the race of Diwata

128
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,204
Which are legendary
fairy beings,

129
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:20,373
Who wrote stories which
became the lives of men.

130
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,742
There was an unruly
Prince who was born...

131
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,011
Oh!

132
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:40,127
(Hopeful instrumental music)

133
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,273
(Foreign language)

134
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:58,045
(Soaring instrumental music)

135
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,491
(Footsteps)

136
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,771
[Audrey] And as the
daughter started to write

137
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:28,008
Her first mortal life story,

138
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:30,677
The royal family
descended on her.

139
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:31,578
And then her family eats her.

140
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,080
Yum, yum.

141
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:37,084
The story is probably
a primitive explanation

142
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:40,353
For how some people
become rich or powerful,

143
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,355
And others become
short-order cooks.

144
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:47,928
But this legend has a
grain of truth to it.

145
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:51,498
I believe there really is some
sort of royal Diwata tribe

146
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,334
With a small kingdom which
is never even been found.

147
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,737
I'm gonna find whatever's
left of the place.

148
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,839
While I'm at it,

149
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,208
Maybe help myself to some

150
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:06,013
Of the untold golden
riches of their kingdom.

151
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:11,251
I wish you luck.

152
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:22,395
(Calm instrumental music)

153
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,701
(Hazel and her mom discussing
in foreign language)

154
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,438
[Nick] What is that?

155
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:35,575
(Hazel and her mom discussing
in foreign language)

156
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,966
Let's get a move on.

157
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:00,333
What?

158
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,501
[Nick] Your stupid adventure.

159
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,136
I'm in.

160
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:06,706
Um, what?

161
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:07,874
I just lost my job,

162
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,776
My agent dumped me.

163
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,411
I venture it has something to do

164
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,613
With the fact my script
was two months late.

165
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:16,716
So let's go get ourselves
killed in the jungle.

166
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:17,917
Hop to it!

167
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,218
[Audrey] Ok!

168
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,486
Before I change my mind!

169
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:21,188
[Audrey] You can't
take all that.

170
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:22,889
[Nick] Well, speak
for yourself.

171
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,324
[Audrey] Alright.

172
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:31,264
(Hopeful instrumental music)

173
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:38,271
[Nick] I changed my mind.

174
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,639
[Audrey] Come on.

175
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:44,611
[Nick] How are
we gonna travel?

176
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,878
I don't know,
I'll figure it out.

177
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:46,513
[Nick] Do you have any money?

178
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,747
[Audrey] No.

179
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:48,815
[Nick] Well, we're not
gonna make it past the pier.

180
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:49,416
[Audrey] Would just...

181
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:02,262
Shh, (mumbling)

182
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,304
(Car engine starts)

183
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:15,608
(Heavy metal music)

184
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:16,676
[Nick] No...!

185
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:21,281
(Heavy metal music)

186
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,053
(Car engine)

187
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:29,856
(Heavy metal music)

188
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:34,661
(Car engine)

189
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:35,695
So are you really
a movie writer?

190
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,197
Yes, I am.

191
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:38,798
Was.

192
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,300
Ok.

193
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:43,703
What do you mean ok?

194
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,272
I mean, yeah.

195
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:46,706
[Nick] What?

196
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,475
You don't think I'm the kind
of guy that can be a writer?

197
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,677
You don't believe that
I house the power

198
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,146
Behind these fingertips to turn emotions into words?
No, no.

199
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,347
I see it.

200
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,316
I'm glad to hear that.

201
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,754
So why are you here?

202
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:06,159
Well, imagine that I had a
gourmet pizza place back in
California,

203
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,828
Not popular, but big
and up-and-coming,

204
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:11,598
Take-out only with a
few regular customers.

205
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:14,334
And then those few regular
customers refused to pay me,

206
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,269
Steal my recipes,

207
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,437
Arbitrate me out of the credits

208
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,272
And then fucked my residuals.

209
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:24,444
So I get a new place, far away,

210
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:27,247
Delivery only this time,

211
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,249
But I have no customers.

212
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,150
But that's ok,

213
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,384
'Cause I get to keep those

214
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:35,322
Piping-hot pepperoni
pizzas all to myself.

215
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:36,889
By the way, what is
pepperoni pizza like?

216
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,890
Would you describe it?

217
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,092
It's been so long.

218
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:42,862
I don't know, depends.

219
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:45,198
Details, specifics.

220
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,233
When's the last time you had a

221
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,401
Savory pepperoni pizza?

222
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,469
They'd never even heard about...

223
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:51,138
Before my dad died.

224
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:52,772
Two months ago.

225
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,074
Hawaiian.

226
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,510
How was it?

227
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,910
Tangy, not sweet
like here, right?

228
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,347
Tangy.

229
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:02,682
Oh, well you hang on to that!

230
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,617
And you relish that
memory, 'cause your

231
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:08,821
Little quest has taken
you far from home.

232
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,223
You're gonna have to let go
that old pizza-loving you

233
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:12,159
And embrace a new you.

234
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:13,560
A you that's ok
with fried chicken

235
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,861
And rice with every meal.

236
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,429
A Philippines you.

237
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,331
That's why I'm here.

238
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:28,308
(No-lyric chants)

239
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:44,791
(Motorcycle engine)

240
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,530
(Heavy metal music)

241
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:54,867
(Heavy metal music
getting louder)

242
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,748
[Audrey] Oh, my god!

243
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:12,852
[Car driver]
(foreign language)

244
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:13,786
[Nick] Come on.

245
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:32,672
(Car engine getting closer)

246
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:38,945
[Audrey] Alright, let's go.

247
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:42,549
[Nick] Wait.

248
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,417
Wait.

249
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:49,456
Wait, wait, wait.

250
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:51,558
You've had your
little adventure-

251
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:53,793
(Car engine drowns
out Nick voice)

252
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:55,595
There's no way in hell

253
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:57,930
That we're gonna get across
half this fucking country.

254
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,405
Hey, guys!

255
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:07,039
We had to get away
from my parents,

256
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,376
So I made Rey steal the jeepney.

257
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,110
I'm hoping if we
can come with you,

258
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,379
If that's alright.

259
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,847
Yeah, I guess.

260
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:15,782
Can this thing make
all the way to Leyte?

261
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,350
Sure, easy.

262
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,499
This is gonna a
burden on all of us.

263
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:33,400
The question really is,

264
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,934
Are you two sure you wanna come?

265
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,569
I guess.

266
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,772
I just want you
to understand me,

267
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:40,740
If you two come you're
in for the long haul.

268
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,809
Got it?

269
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:43,576
- [Hazel] Got it.
- [Rey] Get it.

270
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,313
[Audrey] Ok, good.

271
00:20:46,313 --> 00:20:47,046
Alright, so how far
can we make it...

272
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,948
Oh, relax.

273
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,149
It is going to be easy.

274
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:52,184
You have a car now.

275
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:57,890
(Instrumental music)

276
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,694
(Moves to adventurous
instrumental music)

277
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:30,590
(Adventurous instrumental music)

278
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:49,108
It's just a story for kids.

279
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:50,377
Audrey said the place
is real, that's all.

280
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:52,244
You can be such an idiot.

281
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:53,012
Let me drive.

282
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:55,014
No way.

283
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:57,684
I got this thing
and it's my right.

284
00:21:57,684 --> 00:22:00,052
Oh, rightfully stolen, huh?

285
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,821
You can't even drive!

286
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,723
It was driving on
the parking break

287
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:05,925
The whole time until
I got in the car.

288
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,860
[Audrey] Hey, maybe you
should let him drive.

289
00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:18,371
Slowly!

290
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:20,106
Let off the clutch slowly, Rey!

291
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:20,373
[Audrey] Ok, stop.

292
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:21,508
Stop!

293
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,576
Switch back!

294
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,915
[Rey] It's not my fault.

295
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:31,584
The clutch has always
been jerky on this thing.

296
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,562
Freak.

297
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:45,565
We're breaking up.

298
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,707
Here's the thing you've
got to learn about women:

299
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,410
They're a lot like people
in a lot of ways, but...

300
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:00,012
I was kidding.

301
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:05,518
(Adventurous instrumental music)

302
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:27,239
[Audrey] Ok, crew.

303
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,842
It looks like we've
gotten pretty far today,

304
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:32,779
So, I think we've earned
ourselves a little break.

305
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:35,047
The next town is a day's drive,

306
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:39,486
So everyone is free to
take in the sights.

307
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:44,491
The guide book says
we're in Calbayog city.

308
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:46,793
There's the Mapaso Springs.

309
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:51,197
Best beer in the province,
so there's that I guess.

310
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:52,699
[Nick] But we can't afford
to imbibe at the moment,

311
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:55,101
We have places to be.

312
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:59,438
So everyone: no
drinking, agreed?

313
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,640
- [Hazel] Agreed.
- [Rey] Agree.

314
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,742
Okay.

315
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,019
(Loud dance music)

316
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:47,854
[Audrey] ...do you
have anything like, a-

317
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:50,456
I'd like one of these.

318
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:51,390
How much?

319
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,859
[Shop owner] One at 20 pesos.

320
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:54,293
[Audrey] And this one?

321
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:55,595
Ok.

322
00:24:55,595 --> 00:24:56,629
Thank you.

323
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:15,214
Rey?

324
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:16,415
Rey, what are you doing?

325
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:18,450
No, Rey.

326
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,787
[Audrey] Rey, get up now.

327
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:22,589
Come on, we gotta go.

328
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:23,623
I'm sorry buddy, we gotta go.

329
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:25,658
Alright, get up.

330
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:26,693
[Hazel] Sorry.

331
00:25:26,693 --> 00:25:28,695
Sorry, sorry.

332
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:38,838
[Audrey] Can you bring her...

333
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:41,708
[Audrey] Thank you.

334
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,776
Where the hell is Nick
when you need him?

335
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:58,791
(Car engine starts)

336
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:11,237
(Car engine)

337
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:20,046
(Hazel, Nick and Rey
laughing out loud)

338
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:22,448
[Hazel] Audrey
is so responsible.

339
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,817
[Nick] Yeah, she's like
our mom or something.

340
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,654
(Hazel, Nick and Rey
laughing out loud)

341
00:26:27,654 --> 00:26:29,355
[Hazel] Mom, we're hungry!

342
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:30,556
[Nick] Hey, mom!

343
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:33,359
Mom, I'm sleepy.

344
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,094
Can I sleep now?

345
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:39,165
(Hazel, Nick and Rey
laughing out loud)

346
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:47,774
[Hazel] (foreign language)

347
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,876
[Rey] (foreign language)

348
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:54,346
(Hazel, Nick and Rey
laughing out loud)

349
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:04,957
[Hazel] (foreign language)

350
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,592
(Hazel, Nick and Rey laughing)

351
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:19,571
(Foreign language)

352
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,141
[Nick] (foreign language)

353
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:26,412
(Hazel, Nick and Rey
laughing out loud)

354
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:29,581
[Audrey] Hey, say
whatever you're gonna say.

355
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:30,049
Drunken natives-(laughs
drowns out Audrey's voice)

356
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:36,022
(Hazel, Nick and Rey
laughing out loud)

357
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,690
You guys don't like
the way I do things,

358
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,159
I can go it alone, you know.

359
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:45,965
(Hazel, Nick and Rey
laughing out loud)

360
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:58,344
[Nick] Hey, white girl.

361
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:03,115
Us natives and honorary
natives aren't mad.

362
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,418
We're coming with
you all the way.

363
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,955
Just like you said, ok?

364
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:11,090
So stop crying and
come out of there.

365
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,458
[Audrey] I'm not crying.

366
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:15,394
I know, I know.

367
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:21,801
[Audrey] I'm Filipino
too, actually.

368
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:22,001
[Nick] No kidding?

369
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:23,135
[Audrey] Yeah, half.

370
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:25,704
Just buried under all the white.

371
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:30,242
(Melancholic instrumental music)

372
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:03,242
(Moves to mysterious
instrumental music)

373
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:35,942
(Moves to vibrant
instrumental music)

374
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:37,609
[Nick] Wake up,
wake up, wake up.

375
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,945
Hazel, wake up, get in
the front and drive.

376
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,179
[Audrey] What?

377
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:42,314
[Hazel] (foreign language)

378
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:43,382
[Nick] Shh! Calm down,
calm down! Remain calm!

379
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:44,283
[Hazel] (speaking
foreign language loudly)

380
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,052
[Nick] Listen, there
are motorcycles-

381
00:29:46,052 --> 00:29:47,186
Get in the back, get in the...

382
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:48,320
[Nick] Remain calm!

383
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,823
Everybody needs to stay calm!

384
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:51,924
There's not going
to be any... any-

385
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:53,492
- [Audrey] Nick,
what's going on?

386
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:54,660
(Audrey screams)

387
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,097
(Car engine)

388
00:29:58,097 --> 00:29:59,465
[Bandit] Oh, shit!

389
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,001
[Rey] Who was that?

390
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:03,502
I don't know.

391
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,004
All I know is they pulled
off the side of the road

392
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:07,006
And turned off their headlights.

393
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:08,107
[Hazel] What
were they driving?

394
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:13,279
Motorcycles.

395
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:18,417
(Vibrant instrumental music)

396
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:23,789
They're following.

397
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:27,026
(Vibrant instrumental music)

398
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:28,527
[Hazel] I think
we missed our turn.

399
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:31,697
Nick, get the map!

400
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:35,935
(Vibrant instrumental music)

401
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:38,905
Ok, which way?

402
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:42,241
I don't know, um, left!

403
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:46,946
(Vibrant instrumental music)

404
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:48,948
I meant right.

405
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:50,816
But left is ok too, I was...

406
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:51,483
You're so stupid!

407
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:52,551
Whatever! Fuck!

408
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:54,954
We're lost.

409
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:58,524
(Vibrant instrumental music)

410
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,725
There, go into that
town, right there.

411
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:01,160
(Foreign language)

412
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:14,173
Whatever they want with us,

413
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:16,008
They're not gonna try
anything in town.

414
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:17,809
But, what would
they want with us?

415
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:18,911
They're probably just bandits

416
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:20,179
Looking for an easy mark.

417
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:25,117
[Nick] You think
we'll see them again?

418
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:26,185
[Audrey] Doubt it.

419
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:35,361
(Blissful instrumental music)

420
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:44,703
(Moves to suspense
instrumental music)

421
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:46,138
[Yellow shirt bandit]
(foreign language)

422
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:52,111
[Shop owner]
(foreign language)

423
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,279
[Nick] Give me one of those.

424
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:09,828
Buenas tardes, mi angel.

425
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:10,629
[Hazel] Finally!

426
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,566
[Audrey] Don't leave until
we get back, alright?

427
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:16,635
Stay awake, keep an eye
on all of our stuff.

428
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:21,840
Oh, and try not to write
any shitty screenplays.

429
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,610
(Nick laughs sarcastically)

430
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,745
[Audrey] I think
it's his fault.

431
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,580
He saw them coming first,

432
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,716
Because he just happened
to be on the roof.

433
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:35,187
How do you figure?

434
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:36,055
Well, when he into town,

435
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:37,990
To buy all that booze,

436
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,559
He probably told everyone and
anyone what we were doing.

437
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,294
Probably before he
was even drunk,

438
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:45,531
With that big mouth of his.

439
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:47,799
[Hazel] Are you
gonna get mad at him?

440
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,037
[Audrey] As soon as I stop
being glad-I'm-not-dead,

441
00:32:51,037 --> 00:32:52,438
I'm gonna chew his ass out.

442
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,674
[Hazel] I think you're
really mean to Nick.

443
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:56,642
What?

444
00:32:58,677 --> 00:33:00,579
It's getting to be like
he's your pathetic screw-up

445
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:03,815
Of puppy dog who barks and
breaks all the furniture-

446
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,684
- and you just have always a
newspaper beside his face-

447
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:07,153
Ready to smack even
if he doesn't...

448
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:09,521
Ok, that's really
overreaching...

449
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,923
And then I'm just completely
going to be honest with you,

450
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:13,392
I think it's my fault.

451
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,597
Don't be mad.

452
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:22,301
You know, I'm a lot less mad

453
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:23,569
Knowing that was you
instead of Nick.

454
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,205
See what I mean?

455
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:27,673
Puppy-dog-newspaper...

456
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,342

not going to hit you.

461

[Joey] (foreign language)

463
00:33:56,835 --> 00:33:59,771
If you won't tell him
where we're going.

464
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,074
Tell him that we're
just on vacation.

465
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:04,110
(Foreign language)

466
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:12,551
If they don't believe us-

467
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:16,155
Well then,

468
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:18,390
Just keep trying to lie to them.

469
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:23,329

470
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,566
Excuse me!

471
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:33,405
I'm sorry, my (foreign
language) is an Americana.

472
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:40,612
Yeah, yeah.

473
00:34:44,983 --> 00:34:46,985
Her, right there.

474
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:50,956
[Joey] So, the truth,

475
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:52,824
You know where is the money.

476
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:02,000
Tell the location
or we'll all die.

477
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,737
[Nick] Audrey, everything
is going to be okay,

478
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:08,440
Just tell them where
the stupid place is

479
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,342
And we can have an adventure
some other time, okay?

480

[Joey] (Slowly) Will
you tell? Your friend

496
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:44,102
Wants you to. He
doesn't want you hurt-

497
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:51,009
-But you are okay if he is hurt!

498

[Audrey] Let me go!

499
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,912
Get off of me!

wtih the bikes.

[Nick] There's a lot more

519
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:25,497
That needs healing if
you're interested.

520
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:31,369
You know, your
cowardly escape attempt

521
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,440
Is what got us out of this mess.

522
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,207
I don't know if I
should thank you

523
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,577
Or toss you out and let those
bandits slap you around-

524
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:39,945
- [Nick] Oh, no.

525
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:42,013
We know which one you'll
get more of a kick out of.

Excuse me?

527
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:44,916
[Nick] Maybe they were right.

528
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:46,384
Maybe you don't care
how much I get hurt

529
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,186
So long as your
secrets are kept.

530
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:49,054
I suppose that goes for
all the rest of us.

531
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,021
Oh!

532
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:53,692
As long as I can help it,

533
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:55,961
I won't let anybody
else hurt you,

534
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:57,563
Or anyone here.

535
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:01,600
[Nick] What about that?

536
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,168
You needed it.

538

542

You don't think I'm gonna get

543
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:12,270
Beaten up again do you?

544
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,339
Because that would really
bring down my mood a notch.

545
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,407
[Audrey] Dry up, we're safe.

546
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:17,475
It's not hard to figure
out where we're going,

547
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,110
It's either here or Cebu.

548
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,445
If they still care
about catching us.

549
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:21,580
They probably care more

550
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,114
Now that we've embarrassed them.

551
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:24,750
Doesn't matter
anyways, we're here.

552
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:37,729
Okay, you're gonna
have to tell me

553
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:39,330
Where exactly we're going now.

554
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,431
Okay.

555
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:42,901
Um, Diwata Falls, Kapinyahan.

556
00:42:16,635 --> 00:42:18,637
English, English.

557
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:20,572
Why didn't you
tell me earlier?

558
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:21,973
I was keeping it secret,

559
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,809
So no one might drunkenly
spread it around.

560
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:26,244
Why does it matter?

561
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:28,647
You told me to take
you to Calubian,

562
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:30,782
Which is indeed near
Kapinyahan Bay,

563
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:32,517
But there are no
waterfalls around here,

564
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:34,820
All of the waterfalls are
at Kapinyahan Island.

565
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,286
[Audrey] Kapinyahan Island?

566
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:54,272
[Audrey] What?

567
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:56,642
What?

568
00:42:56,642 --> 00:42:57,943
So I didn't know,

569
00:42:57,943 --> 00:42:59,377
What's so bad about that?

570
00:42:59,377 --> 00:43:00,545
I've never been here.

571
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:01,512
That's why I have you around.

572
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:02,848
Well you don't anymore.

573
00:43:02,848 --> 00:43:04,515
Okay, this again.

574
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,451
Oh! This again!

575
00:43:06,451 --> 00:43:07,552
You don't wanna hear it again?

576
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:08,954
I'll tell you something new,

577
00:43:08,954 --> 00:43:10,221
Whatever fairy tale
adventures that you've

578
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:11,522
Got playing your
head are just that:

579
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,458
In your head!

580
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:14,826
Feel better now?

581
00:43:14,826 --> 00:43:15,961
You've got those two

582
00:43:15,961 --> 00:43:17,528
So wrapped up in
your little fantasy

583
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:19,330
That Rey stole his family's car.

584
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,165
[Audrey] You're a coward.

585
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:22,701
I know that, I'm
not delusional.

586
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,370
You need to stop.

587
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,105
This isn't about me right now.

588
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,774
How are you going to get home?

589
00:43:28,774 --> 00:43:29,507
[Nick] I can take
care of myself.

590
00:43:29,507 --> 00:43:30,876
Yeah, okay.

591
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:31,977
I said I can take
care of myself!

592
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:44,022

593
00:43:44,022 --> 00:43:46,758
[Nick] No, no. Put away that
iPhone! (Discussing in foreign
language)

594
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:47,993

600
00:45:11,342 --> 00:45:12,844
Sorry.

601
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:17,248
[Hazel] We need
to get him back

602
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:18,383
We can't just leave him here.

603
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:19,484
Why not?

604
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:21,286
That's what he wants.

605
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:23,021
We won't get five
feet without him.

606
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:25,090
We need him as a guide.

607
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:26,992
Hazel, the only thing he's
useful for is translating,

608
00:45:26,992 --> 00:45:28,259
Which you can do.

609
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:32,964
Well then, why did you need
him so bad in the first place?

610
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:34,532
That's my point!

611
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:35,666
You weren't coming before,

612
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:36,935
Now that you are, fuck that guy.

613
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:43,274

off your debt tonight

And we'll come get you
in the morning, okay?

619

00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:40,565
(Moves to vibrant
instrumental music)

729
00:56:40,565 --> 00:56:41,799
(Hazel screams)

730
00:56:41,799 --> 00:56:43,400
[Rey] Stop the car!

731
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:43,768
[Hazel] Stop, go

732
00:56:43,768 --> 00:56:45,102
Go, stop... Goddamit!

733
00:56:48,305 --> 00:56:49,173
(Nick screams)
[Audrey] Nick!

734
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:54,211
[Nick] Oh, you broke,
you broke my fall.

735
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:54,945
[Bandit] (screaming
in foreign language)

736
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:56,447
Shhh.

737
00:56:56,447 --> 00:57:03,353
(Screaming in
foreign language)

738
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:05,222
[Rey] (screaming in foreign
language) - [Audrey] Stop, stop.

739
00:57:05,222 --> 00:57:06,724
What are you doing?

740
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:07,458
[Rey] (foreign language)

741
00:57:07,458 --> 00:57:08,258
[Audrey] What do
you people want?

742
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,627
[Rey] (foreign language)

743
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:18,235
[Nick] Oh, he runs
away for you...

744
00:57:18,235 --> 00:57:19,103
[Audrey] Come on.

745
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:34,685
[Nick] Did you see that?

746
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:35,620
You drive!

747
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,021
[Audrey] Why?

748
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:49,433
That was kind of
heroic, what you did.

749
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:51,869
Continue.

750
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:54,238
Getting away from capture,

751
00:57:54,238 --> 00:57:55,573
Stealing the money,

752
00:57:55,573 --> 00:57:58,809
Fighting that man.

753
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:00,110
[Nick] I was just saving
my own ass, it's all.

754
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,446
Ours too.

755
00:58:02,446 --> 00:58:04,214
Keep it up, troop.

756
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,583
Glad I made you come.

757
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:13,123
(Adventurous instrumental music)

758
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:36,681
[Nick] Come on,
we all have to go.

759
00:58:36,681 --> 00:58:38,749
When we get gas, we'll stop.

760
00:58:40,585 --> 00:58:45,055
(Adventurous instrumental music)

761
00:59:01,305 --> 00:59:02,673
[Rey] Aw, aw, aw.

762
00:59:02,673 --> 00:59:03,741
[Nick] This gas station.

763
00:59:03,741 --> 00:59:05,042
[Rey] Yeah.

764
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:10,815
(Adventurous instrumental music)

765
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:27,331
Oh, no!

766
00:59:30,835 --> 00:59:32,169
There's a town a
few miles back,

767
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:33,437
Nick and I will go,
we'll find help

768
00:59:33,437 --> 00:59:34,772
And get the jeepney going again.

769
00:59:34,772 --> 00:59:35,673
I don't wanna be stuck here.

770
00:59:35,673 --> 00:59:37,341
We won't be.

771
00:59:39,977 --> 00:59:45,182
(Wondering instrumental music)

772
00:59:49,053 --> 00:59:51,255
[Nick] So where is this
whole journey taking us?

773
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:52,356
Diwata Falls, where
the legend comes from.

774
00:59:52,356 --> 00:59:53,724
Yes, and?

775
00:59:53,724 --> 00:59:55,726
And what?

776
00:59:55,726 --> 00:59:58,929
Tell me, you need
to be honest here.

777
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:01,065
You're losing Hazel and Rey

778
01:00:01,065 --> 01:00:02,366
And a little honesty
will go a long way.

779
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:03,801
Why is that?

780
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:05,102
Hazel thinks we're
going some temple,

781
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:05,903
Rey believes we're
actually gonna visit

782
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:07,705
The magical fairy beings

783
01:00:07,705 --> 01:00:10,007
And sample their sweet
honey dumplings.

784
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:12,242
They're not questioning things
now, but they will soon.

785
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:13,510
How about you?

786
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:14,745
I want to believe you.

787
01:00:14,745 --> 01:00:15,946
And you don't?

788
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,815
You make it very difficult.

789
01:00:17,815 --> 01:00:19,383
Also there is the unexplained...

790
01:00:19,383 --> 01:00:20,685
Oh, my God! Look!

791
01:00:20,685 --> 01:00:22,152
There's the town!

792
01:00:22,152 --> 01:00:23,420
We don't have to
small-talk anymore.

793
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,723
[Nick] That town
is like a mile away.

794
01:00:27,858 --> 01:00:29,860
This looks like it.

795
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,662
Hey Audrey, why don't
you go in there

796
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:32,663
And ask him how
much it's gonna be

797
01:00:32,663 --> 01:00:34,298
And how long it'll take?

798
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:36,066
Oh, that's right!

799
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:37,301
You can't do any of those
things without me, can you?

800
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:44,241
(Tense instrumental music)

801
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,885
He said they do indeed
do Jeepneys and-

802
01:00:54,885 --> 01:00:59,389
(Tense instrumental music)

803
01:01:03,093 --> 01:01:04,795
[Biker] (speaking
foreign language)

804
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:11,468
Not everybody on a
motorbike is out to get you.

805
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:12,469
You should probably
get over yourself.

806
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:14,171
Come on, lets go.

807
01:01:19,143 --> 01:01:21,946
So, sir, we want
to get going soon.

808
01:01:21,946 --> 01:01:23,047
He says he can take us.

809
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:25,816
[Repairman] (foreign language)

810
01:01:25,816 --> 01:01:30,220
(Motorcycle engine)

811
01:01:31,388 --> 01:01:33,223
I need to talk to
the beautiful one.

812
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:35,225
[Nick] Well, since you
are already talking to me

813
01:01:35,225 --> 01:01:37,494
You must mean the
butch, manly one.

814
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:39,129
Sure.

815
01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:43,934
(Joyful instrumental music)

816
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:27,244
[Audrey] What?

817
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,216
My friends are
still following you.

818
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:34,284
And we won't show ourselves.

819
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:37,054
We know you will always fight,

820
01:02:37,054 --> 01:02:40,124
And if you fight you won't tell.

821
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:44,628
So I guess that's that then.

822
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:46,330
[Black cap repairman] But
your friends are getting tired.

823
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:49,066
They won't be on
your side for long.

824
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:52,269
If you value them, tell
me where you're going.

825
01:02:54,338 --> 01:02:58,242
We'll share. We like
you, you're funny.

826
01:02:58,242 --> 01:03:02,246
If you decide, I'll always
be here a step behind you.

827
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,884
Why are you doing this?

828
01:03:08,886 --> 01:03:11,055
There's probably not
a single dollar

829
01:03:11,055 --> 01:03:14,491
Or diamond, or peso
on that island.

830
01:03:14,491 --> 01:03:17,794
We believe you, we
have to believe you.

831
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,664
We need the wealth
so desperately.

832
01:03:20,664 --> 01:03:23,100
And you have no right
to take it from us,

833
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,702
The people of this land.

834
01:03:25,702 --> 01:03:28,238
There is no money!

835
01:03:30,674 --> 01:03:33,343
We will see.

836
01:03:33,343 --> 01:03:34,744
[Nick] You know I've been
watching the mechanic,

837
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:37,214
And things seem a little fishy.

838
01:03:37,214 --> 01:03:39,116
He's been working
for eight hours

839
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:42,386
And all he's managed to
do is stare at screws.

840
01:03:42,386 --> 01:03:48,192
Stare at a screw,
tighten, untighten.

841
01:03:48,192 --> 01:03:50,560
I think it would be faster
if we all just walked.

842
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:56,166
In fact, that's what
I'm going to do.

843
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,002
[Hazel] Yeah right.
Ten minute rule.

844
01:03:58,002 --> 01:03:59,970
[Nick] What you
mean ten minute rule?

845
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:02,172
A joke we made about you.

846
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:02,873
[Nick] A joke? What
do you mean joke?

847
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:04,074
What kind of joke?

848
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:05,542
What are you talking
about a joke?

849
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:07,611
Well, you have your
knee-jerk reaction.

850
01:04:07,611 --> 01:04:09,279
You say, "Fuck no,
I'm not doing that".

851
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:11,315
I don't talk like that.

852
01:04:11,315 --> 01:04:12,616
And then about ten minutes
later you come back

853
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:15,385
With a completely
reversed opinion,

854
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:16,853
As if you never felt any
different in the first place.

855
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,056
Name one example...

856
01:04:19,056 --> 01:04:20,557
Like when I asked
you to be my guide,

857
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:22,492
Like when the truck driver
chased us down the road,

858
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:23,860
Like when the shopkeep
told us about the island,

859
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,029
Or like when...

860
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:27,231
Okay, whatever. I get it.

861
01:04:27,231 --> 01:04:29,666
But a man has the right
to changes his opinions.

862
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:31,635
That's the difference between
us and the fascists.

863
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:34,004
"And the fascists".

864
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:35,639
[Hazel] Yeah!

865
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:37,074
(Car engine)

866
01:04:37,942 --> 01:04:39,776
[Rey] Wait, wait!

867
01:04:39,776 --> 01:04:41,111
Hey!

868
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:59,063
[Nick] I can see all
the way down this road,

869
01:04:59,063 --> 01:05:00,965
I have eyesight like a carrot. -
I can see all the way too, I see
dark.

870
01:05:00,965 --> 01:05:01,898
What do you think Audrey-

871
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,634
(Car engine failing)

872
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:11,441
(Car engine not starting)

873
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:20,550
(Crickets chirping)

874
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,087
[Hazel] (foreign language)

875
01:05:23,087 --> 01:05:24,854
Yeah, yeah. Cheap-ass job.

876
01:05:24,854 --> 01:05:26,023
We're going into the jungle.

877
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:27,791
What?

878
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:29,226
Well, to drive there

879
01:05:29,226 --> 01:05:31,028
We'd have to go all
the way around this.

880
01:05:31,028 --> 01:05:34,131
But if we go straight through,
we'll go right into town.

881
01:05:34,131 --> 01:05:35,232
Well, we can do
that at day break,

882
01:05:35,232 --> 01:05:36,066
But I don't think any earlier.

883
01:05:36,066 --> 01:05:37,834
No, right now.

884
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:39,636
Grab what you need, we'll get
the jeepney on the way back.

885
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:40,604
[Hazel] But the
jungle is no place

886
01:05:40,604 --> 01:05:41,271
For us in the middle
of the night!

887
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,439
We have plenty of flashlights,

888
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:44,274
And this is just a thin
stretch of jungle.

889
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:47,711
[Nick] You don't know that.

890
01:05:52,316 --> 01:05:56,453
(Melancholic instrumental music)

891
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:58,222
We're never gonna see
you again, are we?

892
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:04,428
(Melancholic instrumental music)

893
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:27,717
(Moves to mysterious
instrumental music)

894
01:07:11,428 --> 01:07:13,797
(House club music far away)

895
01:07:13,797 --> 01:07:15,031
[Nick] How much further is it?

896
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,401
[Audrey] I don't know.

897
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:21,905
(House club music far away)

898
01:07:21,905 --> 01:07:23,873
What is that sound?

899
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:27,944
(House club music far away)

900
01:07:27,944 --> 01:07:29,546
[Audrey] I don't know.

901
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:31,681
Come on, lets just keep going.

902
01:07:34,017 --> 01:07:38,455
(Mysterious instrumental music)

903
01:07:45,429 --> 01:07:49,699
(House club music
getting louder)

904
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:55,539
[Hazel] The music is
coming from over there!

905
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:01,178
(House club music
getting louder)

906
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:18,462
(House club music)

907
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:43,153
What the fuck is
happening here?

908
01:08:43,153 --> 01:08:45,722
[Audrey] Some crazy party.

909
01:08:45,722 --> 01:08:47,491
Is it fourth of
July or something?

910
01:08:47,491 --> 01:08:48,258
[Nick] We don't have
a fourth of July here,

911
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:51,328
Not in the sense that you mean.

912
01:08:51,328 --> 01:08:53,463
Some sacred day that
I've never heard of.

913
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:55,799
I guess it's just in this town.

914
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:57,501
Well, fuck it!

915
01:08:57,501 --> 01:08:59,369
We gotta find some place
to sleep tonight.

916
01:09:00,204 --> 01:09:04,908
(Salsa music)

917
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:40,277
(Crowd applause)

918
01:09:45,148 --> 01:09:47,951
(Crowd applause)

919
01:09:54,391 --> 01:09:59,329
(House club music)

920
01:10:19,349 --> 01:10:23,620
(Moves to low-tempo
house club music)

921
01:10:55,852 --> 01:10:59,389
(Anxious instrumental
music getting louder)

922
01:10:59,389 --> 01:11:01,725
[Nick] Hey!

923
01:11:01,725 --> 01:11:04,694
Come on, there's nothing
to be done tonight.

924
01:11:04,694 --> 01:11:07,331
We'll get a boat in the
morning to go to the island.

925
01:11:07,331 --> 01:11:10,534
You can't keep doing
this, lets go!

926
01:11:10,534 --> 01:11:13,370
What's wrong with
you? What's going on?

927
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:15,605
We have to go, come on!

928
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:17,641
Hey!

929
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:22,746
(House club music
drowning Nick's voice)

930
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:32,021
(House club music)

931
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:56,906
(Moves to sad
instrumental music)

932
01:13:07,283 --> 01:13:09,586
(No audible dialogue)

933
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:13,723
(Moves to tense
instrumental music)

934
01:13:24,801 --> 01:13:26,069
(Sounds of struggling)

935
01:13:39,048 --> 01:13:39,916
(Gunshot)

936
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:40,484
(Gunshot)

937
01:13:41,518 --> 01:13:42,452

938
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:50,193

939
01:14:23,593 --> 01:14:28,532

940
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:38,341
(Group celebrating)

941
01:14:38,341 --> 01:14:39,676
Hey you guys!

942
01:14:43,046 --> 01:14:45,014
Did you see that I
got in fourth place?

943
01:14:45,014 --> 01:14:46,215
[Hazel] Yeah.

944
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:47,416
[Audrey] Pretty great.

945
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:49,118
Yeah, but it wasn't a great
idea to get tanked right now.

946
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:50,787
We have no money.

947
01:14:50,787 --> 01:14:51,955
We left the jeepney,
we've nothing to sell.

948
01:14:51,955 --> 01:14:53,289
Getting to the island is a...

949
01:14:53,289 --> 01:14:54,123
I got fourth outta
fiddy (mumbling).

950
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:56,760
Fiddy what?

951
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:01,831
Fifty, so I got a prize. See?

952
01:15:02,666 --> 01:15:05,168
So I kept going no matter what.

953
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:07,971
(Audrey throws up)

954
01:15:10,607 --> 01:15:15,178
(Tense instrumental music)

955
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,083
[White shirt bandit]
(foreign language)

956
01:15:29,425 --> 01:15:33,763
(Tense instrumental music)

957
01:15:33,763 --> 01:15:35,231
[Nick] And this is
the magnificent vessel

958
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:36,933
Which will bear us
across the currents.

959
01:15:36,933 --> 01:15:38,602
(Rey laughs out loud)

960
01:15:38,602 --> 01:15:40,369
[Audrey] Why is
it on the land?

961
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,271
Is it a land boat?

962
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:49,713
Yeah, well this plus the food

963
01:15:49,713 --> 01:15:51,280
Cost us everything we had.

964
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:53,249
Come on, we gotta get
this in the water.

965
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:55,284
[Audrey] Okay.

966
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:56,753
[Nick] Right over.

967
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,758
[Audrey] Everyone, I just
wanna say a few words.

968
01:16:03,192 --> 01:16:05,061
Okay.

969
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:08,665
I wanted to, um, say, um...

970
01:16:13,336 --> 01:16:15,404
You Filipinos are awesome.

971
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,306
Now, lets do this shit!

972
01:16:19,342 --> 01:16:23,847
(Adventurous instrumental music)

973
01:17:01,818 --> 01:17:05,922
(Moves to dangerous
instrumental music)

974
01:17:17,033 --> 01:17:23,306
[Joey] (foreign language)

975
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:28,978
(Dangerous instrumental music)

976
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,415
[Audrey] No, no! Stop!

977
01:17:32,415 --> 01:17:33,883
I can't do this!

978
01:17:33,883 --> 01:17:35,618
All this running,

979
01:17:35,618 --> 01:17:36,753
I'm going back.

980
01:17:36,753 --> 01:17:37,687
Audrey, you're drunk.

981
01:17:37,687 --> 01:17:39,889
It's alright.

982
01:17:39,889 --> 01:17:41,190
I'm just gonna go and
have a word with them.

983
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:42,225
I'll be fine.

984
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:49,098
(Courageous instrumental music)

985
01:17:57,306 --> 01:17:57,874
(Gunshot)

986
01:17:59,909 --> 01:18:00,844
[Joey] (screaming
in foreign language)

987
01:18:00,844 --> 01:18:02,378
[Audrey] Never mind!

988
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:09,352
(Vibrant instrumental music)

989
01:18:09,352 --> 01:18:11,120
[Nick] "I can't
do this anymore".

990
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,789
"I'm just gonna have
a word with them".

991
01:18:12,789 --> 01:18:14,824
"Never mind!".

992
01:18:14,824 --> 01:18:16,025
(Bandits screaming
in foreign language)

993
01:18:17,493 --> 01:18:22,065
(Vibrant instrumental music)

994
01:18:37,646 --> 01:18:39,648
Hey! Hey, guys, where are you?

995
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:41,217
Hey!

996
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:44,821
Oh, no! Oh, no, where are they?

997
01:18:44,821 --> 01:18:46,155
Oh, shit!

998
01:18:46,990 --> 01:18:51,327
(Vibrant instrumental music)

999
01:18:54,964 --> 01:18:57,834
(Moves to calm
instrumental music)

1000
01:18:57,834 --> 01:18:59,368
[Nick] Wait, this looks clear.

1001
01:18:59,368 --> 01:19:00,837
Let's rest here.

1002
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:08,778
Oh, no!

1003
01:19:29,132 --> 01:19:30,166
Okay?

1004
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:49,986
[Audrey] What?

1005
01:19:54,057 --> 01:20:01,364
(Bandits screaming
in foreign language)

1006
01:20:02,932 --> 01:20:07,403
(Blissful instrumental music)

1007
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:11,740
[Rey] The big ship's cast off.

1008
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:12,775
They're gone!

1009
01:20:12,775 --> 01:20:14,143
(Hazel screams happily)

1010
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,946
[Audrey] Oh, man. No more
crazy motorcycle bandits.

1011
01:20:16,946 --> 01:20:19,182
Ah, we're home free.

1012
01:20:19,182 --> 01:20:21,617
[Nick] Guys, I am so glad.

1013
01:20:21,617 --> 01:20:25,754
And I learned something
from all of this.

1014
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:27,456
Camp fires are just a terrible
idea in this climate.

1015
01:20:29,292 --> 01:20:31,427
[Audrey] They're
leaving us alone.

1016
01:20:31,427 --> 01:20:32,561
It's plain as day.

1017
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:34,297
[Nick] What is?

1018
01:20:34,297 --> 01:20:35,564
[Audrey] Well, they think

1019
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:38,067
That there's something
going on between us.

1020
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:39,768
Ha! Well in that case

1021
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:40,336
Lets call 'em back.

1022
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:41,204
Hey, guys!

1023
01:20:41,204 --> 01:20:42,238
- Stop!
- [Nick] What?

1024
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:44,673
- Stop.
- [Nick] What, what, what?

1025
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:45,741
There is something
going on between us.

1026
01:20:45,741 --> 01:20:47,110
[Nick] Says who?

1027
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:52,515
I'm wise to your ways,

1028
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:54,317
That you always win

1029
01:20:54,317 --> 01:20:56,519
And you do anything
you can to win.

1030
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:58,187
And I'm not gonna be
your tool tonight.

1031
01:21:01,557 --> 01:21:03,960
I'm not all schemes
and calculations, Nick.

1032
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:05,094
[Nick] Yeah, you don't really

1033
01:21:05,094 --> 01:21:07,230
Calculate anything, do you?

1034
01:21:09,665 --> 01:21:12,601
(Melancholic instrumental music)

1035
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:14,203
Nick!

1036
01:21:15,404 --> 01:21:17,006
Ten minute rule.

1037
01:21:19,675 --> 01:21:24,247
(Melancholic instrumental music)

1038
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:56,345
(Moves to adventurous
instrumental music)

1039
01:22:10,126 --> 01:22:14,430
(Moves to tense
instrumental music)

1040
01:22:24,073 --> 01:22:26,142
(Bandit screams in pain)

1041
01:22:30,746 --> 01:22:32,348
[Nick] Hazel! Rey!

1042
01:22:32,348 --> 01:22:34,417
Come here quick, I need
you guys right now!

1043
01:22:35,418 --> 01:22:37,653
Guys, come on! Guys, quick.

1044
01:22:37,653 --> 01:22:39,022
[Hazel] What happened?

1045
01:22:39,022 --> 01:22:41,557
[Rey] Is she shot?

1046
01:22:41,557 --> 01:22:43,326
[Nick] Yeah, I,
I... Oh, my God!

1047
01:22:43,326 --> 01:22:44,660
What are you doing?

1048
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,429
[Nick] I just
started panicking...

1049
01:22:46,429 --> 01:22:47,363
I didn't think to check
her for anything.

1050
01:22:53,236 --> 01:22:58,107
(Sad instrumental music)

1051
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:10,353
We need to get off this island

1052
01:23:10,353 --> 01:23:12,488
And to a city to call your
family to come pick us up.

1053
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:13,856
And then we have to, somehow,

1054
01:23:13,856 --> 01:23:17,226
Get to an American embassy
to deal with this.

1055
01:23:17,226 --> 01:23:19,262
But we've got to act fast,
we don't have much time.

1056
01:23:19,262 --> 01:23:22,165
^Lt's been hours! I don't
know how long she can...

1057
01:23:26,969 --> 01:23:28,471
We would have if
she wasn't so...

1058
01:23:37,113 --> 01:23:37,780
[Nick] Ready?

1059
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:38,347
[Rey] Yeah.

1060
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:40,216
[Nick] Let's go.

1061
01:23:40,216 --> 01:23:41,717
Alright, come on.

1062
01:23:42,918 --> 01:23:43,919
Woah!

1063
01:23:43,919 --> 01:23:46,021
What is it?

1064
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,156
What is it?

1065
01:23:47,156 --> 01:23:48,857
It's nothing. I'm sorry.

1066
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:50,293
Okay, let's get going.

1067
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:55,731
(Sad instrumental music)

1068
01:24:05,141 --> 01:24:05,941
[Nick] We gotta put her down.

1069
01:24:05,941 --> 01:24:07,243
[Rey] What?

1070
01:24:07,243 --> 01:24:08,477
- [Nick] Oh...
- [Rey] What's wrong?

1071
01:24:08,477 --> 01:24:10,679
[Nick] She keeps moving
and it's weirding me out.

1072
01:24:10,679 --> 01:24:12,115
[Rey] If we don't get her
on the boat right now,

1073
01:24:12,115 --> 01:24:13,449
It will be night
before we get across.

1074
01:24:13,449 --> 01:24:14,750
[Nick] We'll go tomorrow.

1075
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:22,325
(Suspenseful instrumental music)

1076
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:15,611
(Crickets chirping)

1077
01:25:20,816 --> 01:25:25,588
(Loud scream)

1078
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:33,462
(Choking)

1079
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:37,233
(Tense instrumental music)

1080
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:41,837
(Loud scream)

1081
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:49,278
(Choking)

1082
01:26:00,022 --> 01:26:04,660
(Melancholic instrumental music)

1083
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:43,666
[Audrey] It hurts.

1084
01:26:44,833 --> 01:26:45,968
We need to leave now.

1085
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:48,537
[Audrey] I need to go back.

1086
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,306
[Nick] Um, what?

1087
01:26:50,306 --> 01:26:51,474
[Audrey] Take me back.

1088
01:26:51,474 --> 01:26:53,242
Back where?

1089
01:26:57,613 --> 01:26:58,747
Okay.

1090
01:27:04,086 --> 01:27:08,824
(Troubled instrumental music)

1091
01:27:30,212 --> 01:27:31,814
Nick.

1092
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:40,523
I'm still..remembering
how to... talking.

1093
01:27:42,224 --> 01:27:44,727
I did more than hit my head.

1094
01:27:52,468 --> 01:27:54,570
Here I am still standing.

1095
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:56,305
So let's finish this!

1096
01:27:56,305 --> 01:27:58,707
What?

1097
01:27:58,707 --> 01:28:00,609
[Audrey] Let's go, we're here already.
[Rey] No, no!

1098
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:02,645
We need to go home.

1099
01:28:02,645 --> 01:28:04,713
You need to see a doctor.

1100
01:28:04,713 --> 01:28:06,114
You were shot...
[Nick] Rey...

1101
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:07,650
In the head!

1102
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:11,320
What are you?
[Nick] Lay off Rey.

1103
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:17,660
(Speaking foreign language)

1104
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:19,328
[Audrey] English!

1105
01:28:19,328 --> 01:28:21,029
We won't follow you anymore!

1106
01:28:22,331 --> 01:28:23,866
Come on, let's go.

1107
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:34,276
[Nick] Hey, he's in the right.

1108
01:28:34,276 --> 01:28:35,711
It's time to go back now.

1109
01:28:35,711 --> 01:28:37,145
Why won't you look at me?

1110
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:38,781
It's hard to look in one eye.

1111
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:41,650
But that's,

1112
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:43,118
That's why we need
to get you, to go,

1113
01:28:43,118 --> 01:28:45,087
We need to get you to a doctor.

1114
01:28:46,455 --> 01:28:47,890
Where would I go?

1115
01:28:47,890 --> 01:28:50,526
Huh?

1116
01:28:50,526 --> 01:28:52,528
You don't know
anything about me.

1117
01:28:52,528 --> 01:28:54,930
I've nowhere to go but forward.

1118
01:28:57,232 --> 01:29:01,804
(Aching instrumental music)

1119
01:30:18,781 --> 01:30:20,916
What's happening to me?

1120
01:30:23,351 --> 01:30:25,187
You're fixing.

1121
01:30:27,623 --> 01:30:29,291
I don't understand it.

1122
01:30:29,291 --> 01:30:30,693
[Nick] You don't need to.

1123
01:30:32,828 --> 01:30:34,930
[Audrey] All that I know,

1124
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:36,632
All I can pass through
my head clearly

1125
01:30:36,632 --> 01:30:38,701
Is to find this place
that calls to me.

1126
01:30:40,235 --> 01:30:41,870
You know where it is?

1127
01:30:43,071 --> 01:30:44,773
How far?

1128
01:30:45,674 --> 01:30:47,142
[Audrey] About an hour.

1129
01:30:49,144 --> 01:30:50,679
Can you stand?

1130
01:30:53,248 --> 01:30:57,953
(Melancholic instrumental music)

1131
01:31:08,964 --> 01:31:10,165
[Audrey] Tell me
what you're gonna do.

1132
01:31:10,165 --> 01:31:12,000
Your future.

1133
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,801
[Nick] When you
finally see your legend

1134
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:14,770
And you let us get out of here,

1135
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:17,005
I'm flying straight
back to America.

1136
01:31:17,005 --> 01:31:19,942
Gonna call my agent, beg
him to take me back.

1137
01:31:19,942 --> 01:31:22,745
And then I'm gonna write
on every crappy soap

1138
01:31:22,745 --> 01:31:25,280
Until I find something
worth doing.

1139
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,715
[Audrey] Sounds nice.

1140
01:31:26,715 --> 01:31:28,283
[Nick] It won't be.

1141
01:31:28,283 --> 01:31:29,585
[Audrey] What's worth doing?

1142
01:31:29,585 --> 01:31:31,219
[Nick] Being famous.

1143
01:31:31,219 --> 01:31:32,521
[Audrey] You're lucky.

1144
01:31:32,521 --> 01:31:33,989
[Nick] Why is that?

1145
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:35,390
[Audrey] I don't
have a future.

1146
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:38,126
Hey, listen to me.

1147
01:31:38,126 --> 01:31:40,963
When all this is done,
you're going home.

1148
01:31:40,963 --> 01:31:42,731
And everything is gonna
return to normal.

1149
01:31:48,571 --> 01:31:50,472
We're here.

1150
01:31:50,472 --> 01:31:52,675
The end of the river, that's it.

1151
01:31:52,675 --> 01:31:53,876
Alright, well
fuck it. Let's go.

1152
01:31:53,876 --> 01:31:54,610
Get on with our lives.

1153
01:31:54,610 --> 01:31:56,311
Wait.

1154
01:31:56,311 --> 01:31:58,046
I wanna see it the morning.

1155
01:31:58,046 --> 01:31:59,615
In the light.

1156
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:06,889
(Mysterious instrumental music)

1157
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:31,079

instrumental music)

(Moves to blissful
instrumental music)

1159
01:34:15,851 --> 01:34:20,155
(Moves to suspenseful
instrumental music)

1160
01:35:10,205 --> 01:35:12,140
[Diwata King] My dear girl.

1161
01:35:16,111 --> 01:35:20,082
You've traveled much too far
on your own strength alone.

1162
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:25,754
Did the humans dare
try to hurt you?

1163
01:35:32,861 --> 01:35:34,462
Come.

1164
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,506
We've saved that seat for you.

1165
01:35:46,474 --> 01:35:49,144
But before you can rest

1166
01:35:49,144 --> 01:35:52,414
And know no loneliness
here with your own people,

1167
01:35:52,414 --> 01:35:55,183
You must acknowledge,

1168
01:35:55,183 --> 01:35:59,054
Understand that your
father was wrong.

1169
01:35:59,054 --> 01:36:02,324
Our responsibility
only is to be fair

1170
01:36:02,324 --> 01:36:04,893
In doling out the blessed
lives or the cursed ones.

1171
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:10,532
These are the Muses of Luck,

1172
01:36:10,532 --> 01:36:14,302
They guide our hands for
Luck alone is fair.

1173
01:36:16,338 --> 01:36:19,741
So now, after living with
the humans as you did,

1174
01:36:19,741 --> 01:36:22,177
As we had planned for you,

1175
01:36:22,177 --> 01:36:24,980
Declare that you recognize
your father's folly.

1176
01:36:32,687 --> 01:36:37,325

(Moves to jubilant

1195
01:40:28,356 --> 01:40:29,724
[Nick] There you go.

1196
01:40:34,362 --> 01:40:36,131
Hey, hey! Are you with me?

1197
01:40:36,131 --> 01:40:37,799
I'm here, I'm here.

1198
01:40:37,799 --> 01:40:39,534
Are you here with me? I'm here.

1199
01:40:39,534 --> 01:40:41,869
I got ya.

1200
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:43,538
I saved you.

1201
01:40:45,207 --> 01:40:47,109
[Rey] Come on.

1202
01:40:50,878 --> 01:40:55,617
(Rejoicing instrumental music)

(Moves to playful
instrumental music)

1206
01:43:22,364 --> 01:43:23,798
[Audrey] You saved me.

1207
01:43:25,099 --> 01:43:27,302
So I guess that makes
you the hero now, huh?

1208
01:43:27,302 --> 01:43:28,536
You just rubbed off on
me a little, that's all.

1209
01:43:32,173 --> 01:43:37,379
(Blissful instrumental music)

1210
01:43:37,379 --> 01:43:38,980
I love this thing.

1211
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:41,449
Now, I'm driving it
again, I'm remembering-

1212
01:43:41,449 --> 01:43:44,952
- [Rey] -it's a long way back.

1213
01:43:44,952 --> 01:43:47,289
Nick, you're some sort
of a writer, right?

1214
01:43:47,289 --> 01:43:49,056
[Hazel] Yeah.

1215
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:50,892
We've never heard
you tell us a story.

1216
01:43:50,892 --> 01:43:54,662
[Hazel] Yeah, tell us!

1217
01:43:54,662 --> 01:43:57,699
This is a little thing
I've been working on.

1218
01:43:57,699 --> 01:44:01,403
But before I begin proper,
I do have an introduction.

1219
01:44:05,307 --> 01:44:09,611
A hero never falters.

1220
01:44:09,611 --> 01:44:12,480
A hero never backslides
or schemes or betrays

1221
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:14,982
And a hero will never fail.

1222
01:44:14,982 --> 01:44:17,118
But people do.

1223
01:44:17,118 --> 01:44:18,620
They have their weaknesses,

1224
01:44:18,620 --> 01:44:22,089
Their deficiencies.

1225
01:44:22,089 --> 01:44:23,291
But tell me,

1226
01:44:23,291 --> 01:44:24,626
What is the fundamental
difference

1227
01:44:24,626 --> 01:44:26,928
Between heroes and
the rest of us?

1228
01:44:27,895 --> 01:44:29,897
Heroes are dead.

1229
01:44:31,165 --> 01:44:35,703
