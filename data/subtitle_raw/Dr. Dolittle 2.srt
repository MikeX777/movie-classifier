35
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,971

38
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:03,850

39
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,436

we better be quiet or he'll know we're here

49
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,630

51
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,848

I'm gonna bite his hands off

53
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,899
I think he knows. . .

54
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,205

patient of a good doctor

55
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,082

142
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,665
you don't wanna spend your
birthday with your family?

143
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,583
I had to have dinner when I was younger

144
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,960

145
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,336

00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,172
cos you're having dinner here

148
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,216

I can see why it's private

154
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:41,771
it's embarrassing

155
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,024
since you got 2 Cs and a D on here

156
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:50,155

talking about being embarrassing

157

158
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,283

00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,759
go get the door

190
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,312
doctor D, what's up? lt's me

191
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,899
me who is me? Back off me

192
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,987
you don't know me?

193
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,448
doctor D, what is going on?

194
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,288
you deliver pizza?

195
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,458
I forgot to give you a tip I'm sorry

196
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,085
it's cool you do don't have to give a petty tip

197
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:14,966
this is your date?

198
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:15,633
this is Eric

199
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,761
Eric this is my dad

200
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,138
my man, what's up?

201
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,392
we need to stay to have family dinner

202
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,228
this is cool with me

203
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,147
don't be like that

204
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,483
you're gonna ruin the dinner for everybody

205
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,361
don't worry

206
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,572
I know how to take of it

207
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,242
pup?

208
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,332
Charliz always has a mind of her own

209
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:48,625
a year and a half

210
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,044
she decided not to wear diapers
anymore, remember that?

211
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:54,464
then she started to make
messes around the house

212
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,681
it's cool I can actually learn something

213
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:03,640
you're really something?

214
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,018
cos you've never to take off
your hat at the dinner table

215
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,688
is your head being hot or what?

216
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,607
1 6

217
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,153
just think in 2 years she is out of the
house and on her way to college

218
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,406
one year and 1 0 months 1 6 days

219
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,408
Berkeley is a close college

220
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,202
if you go there, you can live
at home and save some money

221
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,495
that's a good idea

222
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,082
but I already reserved a college
when I graduate from high school

223
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,210
you reserved already?

224
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,879
someone to see you

225
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,218
excuse me darling

226
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,220
I love you too

227
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,934
you down here

228
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,269
what do you want?

229
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,855
first of all let me beaver wants to
sent a birthday greeting

230
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,857
to your loving daughter

231
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,025
that's very nice

232
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,028
you go tell beaver start getting
out of my nerves

233
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,698
he only wants some moment of your time

234
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,241
what if I say no

235
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,452
I think you need to go in that room

236
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,580
you go tell the beaver

237
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,623
be in my office 8 o'clock tomorrow

238
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,586
he knows you're busy

239
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,340
but this is really a matter
of life or death situation

240
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,551
in my car, 7 am . Alright?

241
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,261
this is good news

242
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,888
the beaver likes good news

243
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,058
Jimmy, get the car

244
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,535
blow the candles and make a wish

245
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,583
surprise

246
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:58,630
give me that

247
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,298
I'm gonna eat that

248
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,133
you lick my fat bump

249
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,718
don't be a pig

250
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,015
we're trying to do something nice
to your daughter

251
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,606
you're not 2 little cute kitties

252
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,400
you're just 2 disgusting rats

253
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,109
no, we are not

254
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,735
you just ruined the birthday cake

255
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,781
if you write backward of rats

256
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:25,699
it's stars

257
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,117
I'm your star

258
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,494
you know hospital backward?

259
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,162
yes it is

260
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,420
diapers!

261
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,338
my favorite, chocolate

262
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,632
say miya

263
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,178
what do you think you're doing?

264
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,014
I think he's about to say something

265
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:51,391
bring me a bone

266
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,185
bring me a large plate of flies

267
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,520
super size

268
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,773
you'll bring me ham

269
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,530
can I talk to Charliz a second?

270
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,913
I'm sorry about tonight

271
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,207
I'm thinking about cutting a little work

272
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,626
and spend more time with you guys

273
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,004
great more animals will be here

274
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,380
what if we don't stay here

275
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,715
what about a big vacation in Europe

276
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,507
the whole family?

277
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,426
are you serious?

278
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:30,513
we're going to Paris, Rome, Greeks

279
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,639
just do it

280
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,351
what do you think?

281
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,270
is it a bribe?

282
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,357
yes, it's a bribe

283
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,233
it's working

284
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,069
yo doc, one more thing I forgot to tell you

285
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,071
tomorrow

286
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:53,912
tomorrow, we're going to Europe

287
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,844
so the raccoon and the parcel

288
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,390
take the road trip to meet the beaver

289
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,892
nice wheel, what do you call this thing?

290
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,061
this is a mustang

291
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,896
any car that's named after me?

292
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:35,453
I'm gonna be go over a couple of rules

293
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,997
rule number 1, no sudden movement

294
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,959
number 2, do not stare at his teeth

295
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,961
he's got a little rodent bite

296
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:44,671
I think he needs bracing

297
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,256
but I'm not a dentist

298
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:48,133
number 3 to 1 0

299
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:51,177
show with respect he deserves

300
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,763
we're talking about the beaver, right?

301
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,306
how're you doing?

302
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,308
how's the hanging?

303
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,102
back away

304
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,396
show some respect to it

305
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,023
the raccoon got a doctor

306
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,858
it's a miracle

307
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:15,994
doctor Dolittle I presume

308
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,704
welcome to my bed

309
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,789
do you like a fish

310
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,750
on, I've eaten already

311
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,043
when the beaver offers you a fish

312
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,627
you just take the fish

313
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:25,420
shut up

314
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,088
sorry boss

315
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,675
I read some of the good things
of your bay area family

316
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,801
bay area family

317
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:34,137
what are you guys

318
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,014
some Mafia or something?

319
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,308
we don't know anything about Mafia

320
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,851
I've never heard of it

321
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:41,186
that's myth

322
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:42,604
I'm just a simple fisherman

323
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,481
I'll only be blessed to make friends

324
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,232
you'd be one

325
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,318
what you guys from me?

326
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,653
I'm losing my territory

327
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:53,031
are other animals moving in
on you or something?

328
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:56,117
the human kind . They're cutting
down our homes

329
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,952
busting our families

330
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,455
we hear they're cutting down the whole forest

331
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,332
you're talking to the wrong person

332
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,501
you gotta contact the nature groups like

333
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:07,337
that has to be you

334
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,173
you are the only one who know
how to speak human

335
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,883
we can't fight humans on my own

336
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,011
they got guns, knives and pull out couches

337
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,055
sure I got rabies, I can bite

338
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,099
but I really can't do so much

339
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:21,559
you guys have no idea what I'm
talking about, do you?

340
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,895
it's human against nature

341
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,523
but with you on our side that'd be nice

342
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:28,775
me on your side, I didn't say
I was gonna help you

343
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,069
I didn't say it

344
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,613
before you say no

345
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,866
I'd like you to see what we're talking about

346
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,059
it's gone

347
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,770
everything gone

348
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,403
how do you save the forest anyway?

349
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,196
it's not gonna be easy

350
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,116
I assume the lumber companies
have a lot of crowd

351
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:22,704
but I do know a few endangered
species living in the forest

352
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,873
who definitely have lost the protective

353
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,584
how am I gonna find how many endangered
animals living in the forest

354
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,920
you can ask Eugine

355
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,173
we find the endangered species

356
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,426
the females killed by the poachers

357
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,928
it's the only western Pacific bear

358
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,348
at least one bear has to be protected, right?

359
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,392
let the lawyer of the logging
company argue this

360
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,019
since she is the only up there

361
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:48,605
there's no chance for survival anyway

362
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,315
there had to be a male too

363
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:51,358
so we get a male up there

364
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:52,484
and let them together

365
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,694
let nature take its course

366
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,696
the only male western Pacific bear

367
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,282
we can find is raised in captivity

368
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,159
never has a bear raised in captivity

369
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,828
been successfully reintroduced to the wild

370
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,705
they never have a world famous doctor

371
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,041
make an introduction

372
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,879
your man left the button open

373
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,589
something wrong?

374
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,552
I hope he didn't see it

375
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,818
I know you're really disappointed

376
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,861
disappointed?

377
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:39,197
about not going to Europe?

378
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,533
why'd I be disappointed?

379
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,492
I made you a promise

380
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,536
and I'm gonna stick to it

381
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:45,662
you don't want me to it

382
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,205
I understand

383
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:50,166
if I say no . I'll regret for the rest of my life

384
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,543
when do we leave?

385
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:52,836
as soon as we get the court order

386
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,337
to stop the tree cutting

387
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,965
who is going to argue the case?

388
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,302
why are you looking around?

389
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:02,053
me?

390
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,347
not me, you

391
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:10,228
for the animals

392
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:13,565
I don't do the animals

393
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:18,611
you are a speciest

394
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:22,657
we're asking for an injunction

395
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:25,660
so that we might the chance
to save the species

396
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,749
this is a delaying tactic a publicity stunt

397
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:35,879
I have an afidavit signed a range
of experts who'll take them

398
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:39,132
a bear raised in captivity is
reintroduced to the wild

399
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,636
it's dangerous and irresponsible

400
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:47,932
simply raised by a circus who
don't know how to feed

401
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,854
let alone let it through its first winter

402
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:56,441
it 'll certainly succumb to Darwin's law of nature

403
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,818
survival of the fittest

404
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,863
but Darwin never met my dad

405
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,407
young lady, that's inappropriate behavior

406
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,785
who's your father?

407
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,329
it's me . I'm her father

408
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:10,246
my name is Dolittle

409
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,791
doctor Dolittle

410
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:16,378
do you feel you can rehabilitate

411
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:19,923
and make it in the wild for the female?

412
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,217
yes I do

413
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,468
in that case I'll delay one month

414
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:30,016
one month, that's it

415
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:37,649
if that bear is capsized in this month

416
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,860
I'll dismiss the order

417
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:41,986
I understand completely

418
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,280
thank you your honor

419
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,788
you can speak with the wild animals

420
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:55,166
and the circus bears?

421
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,168
I don't know much about it

422
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,795
I only know it's living in captivity

423
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,256
I bet they'll be happy to return to the wild

424
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:10,098
so much for a family vacation

425
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:12,767
can doctor figure how much it's gonna be?

426
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:15,895
that's before he met Acher

427
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:50,847
you know what I'm talking about?

428
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:54,100
no, listen .you'll be lucky
winning somebody like her

429
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:57,479
I've had so many girlfriends

430
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:00,315
I never have a girlfriend

431
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:02,776
just bring her by on Monday

432
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:05,737
I can't her here

433
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,072
you have to go to her

434
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:08,698
go to her, where?

435
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:11,076
she is in the forest

436
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:13,286
I don't play in the forest

437
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,083
do you what kind of beer you are?

438
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,544
I'm a singer, dancer

439
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:24,798
you're an endangered species

440
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:28,051
is that a threat? Cos my lawyer. . .

441
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:33,723
you're a very rare bear. You're
called the western Pacific bear

442
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,143
I know I can play any bears

443
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,437
western, polar

444
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,439
I'm freezing

445
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:46,236
your ancestors came from the
mountain of California

446
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,655
when you were 6 months they
took you from your mother

447
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,741
they taught how to dance
according to a hound dog

448
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:54,786
I taught myself that

449
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:57,706
cos I'm a panda bear

450
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:01,626
yes funny stuff

451
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:03,795
what I'm proposing to you is

452
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:06,631
I'd like you back to your ancestors' room

453
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:09,217
and teach you to be a real bear

454
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,429
I like the bear I'm... I'm famous

455
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:14,723
do you have a gift shop?

456
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:16,433
I have my own baby

457
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:19,811
you do this I promise you'll
be the most famous bear in the world

458
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:21,354
famous that pooh

459
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:22,105
are you kidding me?

460
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,274
you pull this off and you're saying

461
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,483
Winnie the who?

462
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,986
you got yourself a bear?

463
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:31,364
and what's the most unusual
story of the year

464
00:25:31,656 --> 00:25:35,201
doctor Dolittle is going to
rewrite the law of nature

465
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:39,330
by tempting to reintroduce a
performing bear into the wild

466
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:43,501
and in doing do hoped to save an
entire force from destruction

467
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,712
it's Darwin versus Dolittle

468
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:47,714
get over yourself

469
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:51,676
I got 2 lumber millers waiting for that wood

470
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:54,721
I understand but it's complicated

471
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:57,849
especially if that bear survives

472
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:02,312
you're the one who's going to be endangered

473
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:06,649
that bear is bound to screw up

474
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:11,279
when he does, have yourselves a little toy

475
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:14,699
I have just the place to put it

476
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:45,563
so we're going to the forest
waiting for Acher to arrive

477
00:26:45,897 --> 00:26:47,315
when the family's settled

478
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:51,194
I'm starting to look for mount number one

479
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:56,366
looks like a good place

480
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:58,868
simple pleasure

481
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:03,164
that woof is a fox

482
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:09,879
you like that

483
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:13,174
there's more where I came from

484
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:17,262
what is that?

485
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:20,056
some kinda secret lady dog's code

486
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,599
you like me?

487
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:25,186
this is called back scratching

488
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:30,358
where are you going?

489
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:32,068
call me

490
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:34,404
so the big day finally came

491
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:35,697
I have a feeling

492
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,782
the fur is gonna fly

493
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:40,452
you all know why we're here

494
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:43,288
we're about to do something
we've never done before

495
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:45,582
everyone thinks we can't pull this off

496
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:47,375
they got their blaze sharpened

497
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,960
truck ready to roll

498
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:52,255
we're going to prove them wrong, right?

499
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:55,717
I want everybody to put their claw together

500
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:58,136
how about an applause for the bear

501
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,180
who is going to leave?

502
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:09,898
are you going to save the forest?

503
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:12,609
reach further

504
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:16,571
is it some kinda joke?

505
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:18,865
I wanna go serious on you for a second

506
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,242
I got my work cut out

507
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:22,994
but with your help I know. . .

508
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:24,537
one thing

509
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:52,774
the show is over

510
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,443
you got your work cut out for you pal

511
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:58,530
ok I'm done . Turn it off

512
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:04,119
it's so dirty

513
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:06,788
yes, it's a shit hole

514
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,541
is that her?

515
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,418
she is a babe

516
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:14,129
look at the way she walks

517
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:16,381
I love her wet

518
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:18,049
I'm going over to introduce you

519
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,051

520
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,471
tell her I really her fat pouch

521
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:24,806
but don't be cruel

522
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:26,725
I'll try to work that

523
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:32,856
are you coming over here?

524
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:34,983
I'm real busy foraging

525
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:37,652
my name is John

526
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:39,237
I'm Eva

527
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,572
that's a pretty name

528
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:41,781
nice to meet you

529
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,533
a quick question

530
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:46,077
how would you like to meet your man of dream?

531
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:47,746
you're real cute

532
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:49,664
but I don't go for the other species

533
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:51,332
I'm not talking about man

534
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,293
I'm talking about a male bear

535
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:54,210
how would you like to meet the

536
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:57,839
big magnificent male over there

537
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:01,343
I don't think I see him

538
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:03,720
is he standing behind that tree?

539
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,765
let me explain what's going on

540
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,641
there's a logging company that's

541
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:10,268
trying to tear down this forest

542
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:11,936
the only I can stop is

543
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:15,065
I bring 2 western Pacific bear together

544
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:16,900
you're a western Pacific bear so is he

545
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:18,777
if I can the 2 of you together

546
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:20,612
and you make a little western Pacific bear

547
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,032
you see where I'm going?

548
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:30,872
hey Acher come over here

549
00:30:33,124 --> 00:30:35,377
I think we can work it out

550
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:39,464
what do I say to her?

551
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:40,173
tell her a little more about yourself

552
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:42,592
tell her a little more about yourself

553
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:46,971
I like walking on the beach

554
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:49,599
and sharing pop corns with someone

555
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:52,769
and also the sound of back street boys

556
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:54,187
you're weird

557
00:30:54,312 --> 00:30:56,398
weird? Isn't sexy

558
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:02,070
why don't you let me take it from here

559
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:07,158
what do you think of Acher, cute?

560
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:08,827
don't make me eat you

561
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:11,871
I know he's a little uncomfortable
with female around

562
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:13,957
that's not even the point

563
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,583
I need a real bear

564
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,336
someone who can hunt and provide for me

565
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:22,924
I'm already involved with someone

566
00:31:23,425 --> 00:31:25,427
you have a bear friend already

567
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:27,637
are you in love with this bear

568
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:30,181
my cousin married for love but she

569
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:33,935
know her husband has another in the north

570
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,770
so you're not in love

571
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:37,856
so let's make a deal

572
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:41,609
in one month's time, I'm going to

573
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:42,819
turn that bear into someone

574
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:45,196
you'll be proud to have little baby bears of

575
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:04,924
perfect night

576
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:07,302
so you're just breathing the country air

577
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:09,596
and listening to the crickets chirping?

578
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:13,475
you know what the crickets are saying?

579
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:16,728
I don't know. You're the one who
speaks to the animals

580
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:19,230
a monkey don't come to me asking
for malt of 40 ounce

581
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:22,233
I can't do that I stay in the room

582
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:24,694
you ever seen me talk to an animal?

583
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:26,696
slow down a little

584
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:29,741
the crickets are the human temperature

585
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:31,159
you can tell how colder it is

586
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:33,161
the faster they're chirping

587
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,418
it seems a little colder

588
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:10,907
what's up baby?

589
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:21,793
maybe you should tell me what's up

590
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,089
I'm gonna stay a couple of days if it is cool

591
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:31,511
what is that you don't understand?

592
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:32,804
his bag

593
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:34,347
he's staying for a couple of nights

594
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:36,016
mama said so

595
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:41,396
you're gonna sleep on the
sleeping bag on the floor

596
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:45,900
by the way I'm watching you

597
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:48,111
not just me I got all the eyes all around the woods

598
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:50,113
you know I talk to birds, right?

599
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:52,615
you watch your back

600
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:58,788
I'm watching you

601
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,171
can we see what else is on?

602
00:34:06,338 --> 00:34:09,174
no you gotta watch this and learn

603
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:11,801
how to survive in the winter

604
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:14,512
what's he doing? Digging?

605
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:16,806
you don't even know what sharp
claws are for?

606
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:21,394
bears're excellent swimmers

607
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:22,729
not this bear

608
00:34:22,854 --> 00:34:25,106
you're not just sitting there telling
me you can't swim

609
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,526
haven't you ever heard there is a
new invention called boat

610
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:32,072
tomorrow we're gonna get up at the crack of dawn

611
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:33,948
I'm gonna teach you how to fish

612
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,369
and so began the bearathon

613
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:40,163
the training is so unbearable

614
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:42,540
so hairy. Ok, that's all

615
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:44,834
this might be full of fish . Let's go

616
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:46,836
so are lobsters

617
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:48,171
look at the water

618
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:49,839
that's where the fish is

619
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:51,841
there's one touched me

620
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:56,596
I want you to put your head
down and grab a fish

621
00:34:58,348 --> 00:35:00,183
I want you to do just like what you saw on TV

622
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:02,227
put your head under the water and catch a fish

623
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:05,063
I'm here with you . Go under water

624
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:07,691
I'm trying

625
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,321
that's Achder

626
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:16,032
what's up?

627
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:21,705
you get one

628
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:23,998
I can't breathe

629
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,598
tell me how smart you can be to
lift your head out of the water

630
00:35:40,765 --> 00:35:41,725
when you can't breathe?

631
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:43,143
I saw a light

632
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:45,562
it was beautiful

633
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:46,896
let me take you for a swim

634
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:49,065
that'll sharpen you up

635
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:52,485
we're gonna find something you can catch

636
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,654
I saw my grandmum

637
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:00,869
come on eat

638
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,294
am I close?

639
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:11,004
cold

640
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:12,797
and the force

641
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:14,924
colder? Warmer

642
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:16,593
attic

643
00:36:16,718 --> 00:36:17,927
how is going?

644
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:20,597
it's going great. We bare need 3 weeks

645
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:23,099
he's already foraging grapes

646
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:24,642
I can't see why he's walking away

647
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:27,228
he's circling the grapes

648
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:29,564
why? Are they dangerous grapes?

649
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:31,733
grapes are not dangerous?

650
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:37,530
he's doing great. We're right on schedule

651
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:50,794
explain it to me again

652
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:53,338
I'm going to crawl into a dark space

653
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:55,298
and sleep for 6 months

654
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:57,342
it's called hyphenation

655
00:36:57,509 --> 00:36:59,469
it sounds depressing

656
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:00,887
how do I eat?

657
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:05,433
you eat a lotta enough and last the whole winter

658
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:07,018
where is the bathroom?

659
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:14,693
a week before you start hyphenating

660
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:18,947
you eat dirt, moss, hair and green glass

661
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:26,705
it blocks my butt?

662
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:37,298
you want me to sleep for 6 months

663
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:39,467
with a big cork in my butt

664
00:37:43,972 --> 00:37:47,100
come back here see ya

665
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,232
I'll leak the gas and sleep in
the back with the kids

666
00:37:56,234 --> 00:37:57,318
this isn't gonna work

667
00:37:57,402 --> 00:37:58,945
I almost drowned

668
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,488
Evy doesn't like me

669
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:02,699
I'm sick and tired of your complaints

670
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:04,826
look up at the tree, what do you see?

671
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:06,911
a bird

672
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:08,455
a bird and its home

673
00:38:08,663 --> 00:38:10,081
and below is a squirrel

674
00:38:10,832 --> 00:38:13,251
down is a little rabbit in his home

675
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:15,545
all these animals are depending on you

676
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,214
you can do it. Just listen to your inner bear

677
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:19,674
just trust him

678
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:22,093
he'll tell you what to do

679
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:45,784
is it really necessary?

680
00:38:55,293 --> 00:38:56,586
go in there

681
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:57,295
why?

682
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,923
there're a couple of bears inside
who want to meet you

683
00:39:17,899 --> 00:39:20,068
do I hear someone talking

684
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:24,030
these kids today have no respect

685
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,826
I think he needs us to teach him a lesson

686
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:32,205
get over here I'm gonna give you a bear hug

687
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:34,124
actaully it's going quite well

688
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:52,517
looks like everybody like music

689
00:39:56,354 --> 00:39:58,690
while the cats are away, the mouse will play

690
00:39:59,524 --> 00:40:01,359
I mean teenagers

691
00:40:20,128 --> 00:40:22,047
you gotta a cover

692
00:40:22,922 --> 00:40:25,508
there is something I've been
meaning to do since I gotta here

693
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:28,219
what is that?

694
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:41,316
your plan worked out

695
00:40:41,399 --> 00:40:42,984
the drink is on me

696
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:46,529
mean while the doc's giving Acher a lesson

697
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:49,032
could you leave a little for me

698
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:50,950
cos technically it belongs. . .

699
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:53,536
just a thought

700
00:40:53,995 --> 00:40:55,580
what's going here?

701
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,544
you don't have to put up
with that, get out of here

702
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:04,547
that's one hot fox

703
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:07,050
don't you know every female is looking

704
00:41:07,175 --> 00:41:08,551
for the strongest female

705
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:10,095
what about personality?

706
00:41:10,178 --> 00:41:12,305
I'd rather die a virgin

707
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:18,269
alpha male is the boss. lt is the boss male

708
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:23,108
alpha male should learn how to walk

709
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:25,026
like an alpha male

710
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:26,736
walk the walk

711
00:41:30,907 --> 00:41:32,534
it's about power

712
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:35,787
unchecked, uncompromise

713
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,792
didn't I ask you to line the garbage pales

714
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:42,794
you line them you damn self

715
00:41:43,128 --> 00:41:44,421
what?

716
00:41:45,338 --> 00:41:47,132
I was talking with the animals

717
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:54,305
I'm on my way. I'm going to
get food right here

718
00:41:54,472 --> 00:41:55,890
go I'm going?

719
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:56,975
where're you going?

720
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,643
talk the talk. shut up

721
00:41:58,768 --> 00:42:00,270
you telling me to shut up?

722
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:01,813
I am talking to the animals

723
00:42:01,938 --> 00:42:03,815
I'm going to get the food

724
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:12,240
sure you don't want this thing?

725
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:20,123
I have a question

726
00:42:20,206 --> 00:42:21,666
you say you'll spend your
whole life in show business

727
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:23,918
when is it gonna be a big finish?

728
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:33,970
I mean in life

729
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,638
who do you share your success with?

730
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:38,266
your hopes, dreams, fear and failure

731
00:42:43,271 --> 00:42:45,815
sometimes I'm lonely

732
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:47,359
I've never been in love

733
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:48,651
this is your chance

734
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:50,403
I think Evy really likes you

735
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:52,572
did she say something?

736
00:42:53,114 --> 00:42:55,367
you gotta read between the line

737
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:58,161
she loves me? I knew it

738
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,122
you shouldn't be carried away

739
00:43:10,965 --> 00:43:12,008
I think it's the mushroom cos

740
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:13,551
you've eaten a whole bag

741
00:43:14,135 --> 00:43:16,680
tomorrow you're gonna see a brand new bear

742
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:18,723
I think I'll call it a night

743
00:43:20,308 --> 00:43:22,060
it's a little scary out here

744
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:25,397
can you stay until I fall asleep

745
00:43:29,275 --> 00:43:31,361
I'll wait until you fall asleep

746
00:43:33,613 --> 00:43:35,532
can you leave a light on?

747
00:43:37,617 --> 00:43:39,577
the light stays on

748
00:43:39,911 --> 00:43:42,288
keep this here

749
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:02,726
it's a new Acher in town

750
00:44:14,362 --> 00:44:16,281
feel windy

751
00:44:16,531 --> 00:44:19,451
feel the muscle cramp

752
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:24,664
don't quit

753
00:44:25,957 --> 00:44:28,835
my butt stinks

754
00:44:29,669 --> 00:44:32,672
can you rub my butt, please

755
00:44:39,846 --> 00:44:41,973
doc finally realized he wasn't able to make

756
00:44:42,098 --> 00:44:45,101
Acher fast enough to impress Evy

757
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:47,771
maybe he can make him sweater

758
00:44:50,398 --> 00:44:53,151
how can anybody be so beautiful

759
00:44:53,485 --> 00:44:55,445
why don't you go over and tell her?

760
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:02,744
that's Sunny, her little bear friend

761
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:06,873
don't get discouraged

762
00:45:07,165 --> 00:45:09,084
you can win her over

763
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:12,003
you just figure out what she likes

764
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,713
let's take my wife . .

765
00:45:15,507 --> 00:45:16,633
I'm sorry

766
00:45:16,841 --> 00:45:18,301
she likes to be surprised

767
00:45:18,426 --> 00:45:20,553
like jumping out of the bushes and sreaming?

768
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:23,473
do something romantic

769
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:25,642
say I'm thinking about you all the time

770
00:45:25,767 --> 00:45:27,602
you're always on my mind

771
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:30,939
you say that all the time?

772
00:45:31,022 --> 00:45:32,816
I used to

773
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:37,195
lately I'm caught up in this

774
00:45:38,196 --> 00:45:40,782
I think I need a little practice

775
00:45:50,709 --> 00:45:52,168
what are you doing?

776
00:45:53,878 --> 00:45:56,715
it's all about you tonight

777
00:45:57,549 --> 00:45:59,426
I sent the children up to the movies

778
00:45:59,592 --> 00:46:01,970
and the bears camping in the woods

779
00:46:07,475 --> 00:46:08,518
you can see me

780
00:46:10,061 --> 00:46:12,480
I'm blending, getting interwoven . . .

781
00:46:15,608 --> 00:46:17,402
I can give you some pointer

782
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:22,490
where were we?

783
00:46:22,615 --> 00:46:24,951
you were thinking about the candles
and some wine would up make for

784
00:46:25,076 --> 00:46:27,203
annoying me for the last few days

785
00:46:30,165 --> 00:46:32,417
I know something that'll be able to resist

786
00:46:37,255 --> 00:46:38,882
is it our wedding song?

787
00:46:39,257 --> 00:46:40,091
that's not fair

788
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:45,263
show is about to start

789
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:47,098
what show?

790
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:04,699
he is good

791
00:47:05,784 --> 00:47:08,578
he scratched my belly the other day

792
00:47:11,706 --> 00:47:12,999
what's going on?

793
00:47:13,792 --> 00:47:16,419
he is truly in love with her

794
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:18,588
give her some garbage

795
00:47:18,713 --> 00:47:20,548
chicks like garbage

796
00:47:33,603 --> 00:47:35,397
get out of here all of you

797
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:38,900
this is really helpful

798
00:47:38,983 --> 00:47:40,985
I'm learning a lot, truly

799
00:47:41,611 --> 00:47:43,363
we'll discuss tomorrow

800
00:47:43,488 --> 00:47:45,532
you're gonna discuss what tomorrow?

801
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:57,419
why don't you sit on the couch?

802
00:48:01,464 --> 00:48:03,091
what she said doc?

803
00:48:03,216 --> 00:48:06,094
she said she loves me so much that
I can sleep on the couch

804
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:12,225
I'm a man on the couch

805
00:48:29,993 --> 00:48:31,119
Romeo is on the move

806
00:48:34,372 --> 00:48:36,041
there he goes

807
00:48:39,044 --> 00:48:40,920
I was only going to the bathroom

808
00:48:42,422 --> 00:48:44,174
you can hold it

809
00:48:50,263 --> 00:48:51,806
what's wrong with your voice?

810
00:48:53,808 --> 00:48:57,854
why don't you put some sugar in . . .

811
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:06,738
is that our song?

812
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:14,871
you should learn to climb trees

813
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:18,416
that's a bruise

814
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:20,877
come on out of there never

815
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,004
I'm sure it wasn't that bad

816
00:49:28,927 --> 00:49:30,762
I understand . We can fix it

817
00:49:31,012 --> 00:49:33,181
we just need to work a little harder

818
00:49:33,682 --> 00:49:37,435
we're staying here we'll make
our own bear suit

819
00:49:38,269 --> 00:49:39,729
cos we were wondering it'd be alright

820
00:49:39,854 --> 00:49:41,981
if every animal in the entire forest

821
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:44,067
is going to stay with you next week?

822
00:49:44,442 --> 00:49:47,028
I want you to come out right now

823
00:49:48,738 --> 00:49:50,949
who are you calling a coward?

824
00:49:51,783 --> 00:49:54,953
you're a big coward for a quit like this

825
00:49:57,914 --> 00:50:00,375
my wife and my daughters are mad at me

826
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:03,086
I'm spending my vacation with a pizza boy

827
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:08,258
now listening to you furry cry baby telling me

828
00:50:08,466 --> 00:50:10,385
it's too hard

829
00:50:13,221 --> 00:50:15,473
Evy laughed at me

830
00:50:17,475 --> 00:50:20,770
she is even better than a coward like you

831
00:50:21,938 --> 00:50:23,565
I didn't poke a bear

832
00:50:28,486 --> 00:50:29,696
I'm warning

833
00:50:29,821 --> 00:50:30,655
I'm poking you

834
00:50:30,739 --> 00:50:31,656
stop it

835
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:44,002
that was good, bear like

836
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,589
you just take your ass back to the circus

837
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:53,762
I'm an alpha bear

838
00:52:43,705 --> 00:52:45,498
there was love in the air

839
00:52:45,623 --> 00:52:47,667
be a man

840
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:54,507
now you listen to me

841
00:52:54,799 --> 00:52:56,885
you're in my house now

842
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:11,816
you wanna go out with me tonight?

843
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:14,986
what you think you're doing?

844
00:53:15,695 --> 00:53:17,489
I'm not doing anything

845
00:53:21,493 --> 00:53:23,286
you marked my tree

846
00:53:23,828 --> 00:53:27,791
I don't even know what those words mean

847
00:53:28,124 --> 00:53:29,793
I drink a lot of water

848
00:53:32,587 --> 00:53:34,464
it smells like lemonade

849
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:41,054
it smells like anomia

850
00:53:41,179 --> 00:53:43,139
I'm getting dizzy

851
00:53:44,182 --> 00:53:45,725
let's beat it

852
00:53:46,267 --> 00:53:47,394
what're you doing?

853
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:48,561
we're having fun

854
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:51,314
you make a very handsome couple

855
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:54,317
I hate myself

856
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:04,327
if you want it I'll go up

857
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:06,329
don't even think about it

858
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:08,790
I'm gonna go get it for you

859
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:12,419
it's too dangerous. Promise me

860
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:17,549
I like you too

861
00:54:20,051 --> 00:54:21,845
what're you girls doing over here?

862
00:54:22,595 --> 00:54:24,264
beat it, circus boy

863
00:54:26,683 --> 00:54:29,769
your charm is matched only by your odor

864
00:54:34,065 --> 00:54:36,901
what's he saying? I'm confused

865
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:42,532
you think you get used to it?

866
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,370
maybe you'll be better being with me

867
00:54:47,454 --> 00:54:49,122
don't do worse

868
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,211
you'll only be a city bear I need more than that

869
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:08,350
shall we put our cards on the table?

870
00:55:10,393 --> 00:55:12,437
this bear you brought up here

871
00:55:12,562 --> 00:55:14,981
is much likely to have little bear babies

872
00:55:16,858 --> 00:55:18,651
it ain't gonna happen

873
00:55:22,947 --> 00:55:25,075
here's my offer

874
00:55:25,158 --> 00:55:28,953
I'll set aside 1 0 acres turning it into a sanctuary

875
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,082
you can bring your animal buddies there

876
00:55:40,507 --> 00:55:42,592
that's the offer

877
00:55:42,717 --> 00:55:44,260
the dead line is Wednesday 1 2 noon

878
00:55:44,344 --> 00:55:46,262
let me be clear it's 1 2:01

879
00:55:46,346 --> 00:55:49,265
we'll be sending every piece of equipment

880
00:55:49,391 --> 00:55:52,644
we got. By Friday there won't be
a tree standing there

881
00:55:56,147 --> 00:55:58,817
I need to run this by my wife

882
00:55:58,942 --> 00:56:00,652
there's a pay phone in the back

883
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:07,575
phone the wife

884
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:10,036
always a sign of weakness

885
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:19,754
I know what to do I got my thing finished

886
00:56:30,932 --> 00:56:32,517
I gotta tell you this thing is over

887
00:56:32,642 --> 00:56:34,102
sorry to drag you in all of this

888
00:56:34,185 --> 00:56:36,146
might as well give you an audition in Vegas

889
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:38,314
cos these guys offered me a deal

890
00:56:38,398 --> 00:56:39,524
this is the best I can do

891
00:56:39,649 --> 00:56:41,985
the best you can do is not give up on me

892
00:56:42,402 --> 00:56:44,821
you told me, listen to your inner bear

893
00:56:47,032 --> 00:56:49,367
I know how I can win Evy

894
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,829
I know I'm dumb or something

895
00:56:52,954 --> 00:56:54,831
I'm giving you one more chance

896
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,879
the ice cream is acting up

897
00:57:01,546 --> 00:57:03,381
I got depressed by Sunny and Eva

898
00:57:06,301 --> 00:57:08,720
I realized I'm in love with Eva

899
00:57:12,223 --> 00:57:14,434
don't you dare throw up on me

900
00:57:14,642 --> 00:57:16,853
it's gonna come out

901
00:57:18,229 --> 00:57:20,106
you gotta sit down on the toilet

902
00:57:21,649 --> 00:57:23,318
you gotta lift it up first

903
00:57:26,279 --> 00:57:28,323
I'm gonna keep guard you just sit there

904
00:57:30,575 --> 00:57:31,534
I'll meet you one second

905
00:57:31,618 --> 00:57:32,744
I gotta take care of some business

906
00:57:32,869 --> 00:57:34,245
what are you talking in there?

907
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:34,871
I was talking to myself

908
00:57:34,996 --> 00:57:35,914
I gotta. . .

909
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:38,041
sometimes I gotta coax it down

910
00:57:38,124 --> 00:57:40,418
you must have some little pet talk

911
00:57:44,422 --> 00:57:45,924
let me get the window open

912
00:57:56,518 --> 00:57:58,478
it's worse than I thought

913
00:58:02,941 --> 00:58:03,733
you just ate ice cream?

914
00:58:03,858 --> 00:58:05,568
that's not ice cream

915
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:18,039
no deal . Thanks for your time

916
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:29,426
was that me?

917
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:35,974
I'm trying to blend

918
00:59:56,179 --> 00:59:57,847
your mother is little worried

919
01:00:14,155 --> 01:00:15,323
I knew something was bothering you

920
01:00:15,407 --> 01:00:16,908
tell me

921
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:19,619
daughter to daddy

922
01:00:20,745 --> 01:00:22,872
you wanna cry, we cry together

923
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:27,210
nothing stop

924
01:00:27,919 --> 01:00:31,548
it must be the mountain messing me up I'm fine

925
01:00:31,923 --> 01:00:33,967
you sure you're alright

926
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:46,021
take your time I'm in the house

927
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:55,780
talking time's done

928
01:00:55,947 --> 01:00:57,574
it's time to be bold

929
01:00:59,451 --> 01:01:01,286
he's going up to the high

930
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:10,378
this cliff is higher than I remember

931
01:01:16,051 --> 01:01:17,719
you come back here . Get back

932
01:01:18,428 --> 01:01:20,305
I'm doing it or die

933
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:24,351
what are you doing here?

934
01:01:26,978 --> 01:01:29,856
I'm not gonna win Eva by
eating a bunch of worms

935
01:01:32,734 --> 01:01:34,778
I need to show her how much
she means to me

936
01:01:35,153 --> 01:01:36,738
if you fall you're just stupid

937
01:01:40,283 --> 01:01:41,993
circus boy got a little trick

938
01:01:45,121 --> 01:01:46,539
it's not gonna hold

939
01:01:52,754 --> 01:01:54,547
I'll buy you the honey

940
01:01:57,050 --> 01:01:58,718
break

941
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:01,262
I want you to come down

942
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:02,931
I'm fine

943
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:05,975
there're bees

944
01:02:06,184 --> 01:02:08,311
don't move

945
01:02:08,478 --> 01:02:09,896
they're sting me

946
01:02:16,403 --> 01:02:18,363
protect the hive

947
01:02:39,634 --> 01:02:41,177
jump circus boy

948
01:02:41,261 --> 01:02:43,054
go eat the salmon

949
01:02:59,404 --> 01:03:00,739
why'd you do something like that

950
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:02,240
are you crazy?

951
01:03:02,365 --> 01:03:04,325
I could have got that hive if I wanted it

952
01:03:06,745 --> 01:03:07,912
we're not working out

953
01:03:08,038 --> 01:03:09,414
take a hike

954
01:03:14,085 --> 01:03:16,087
I mean would you like more honey?

955
01:03:18,423 --> 01:03:21,176
you're ready to talk about presuming the species

956
01:03:21,468 --> 01:03:24,888
we could talk or you count to a
hundred and cone to get me

957
01:03:31,728 --> 01:03:34,105
focus

958
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:38,109
I should really in the open

959
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:44,991
pace yourself not so fast

960
01:03:56,461 --> 01:03:59,047
daddy is back

961
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,261
what happened?

962
01:04:06,554 --> 01:04:08,264
it's Acher

963
01:04:10,809 --> 01:04:14,437
folks we got a wild animal coming through

964
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:30,787
I'm doctor Dolittle

965
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:32,205
what happened?

966
01:04:32,414 --> 01:04:33,998
he broke down the back door

967
01:04:34,249 --> 01:04:36,084
we found him ransacking in the kitten

968
01:04:40,171 --> 01:04:42,132
let's move up show is over

969
01:04:44,342 --> 01:04:46,219
it's me what happened?

970
01:04:47,012 --> 01:04:48,847
I was so close

971
01:04:49,055 --> 01:04:51,099
they came out of no where

972
01:04:51,766 --> 01:04:54,477
are you ready to save the forest?

973
01:04:56,354 --> 01:04:58,898
we're setting aside 1 0 acres of the forest

974
01:04:59,024 --> 01:05:02,527
we cal it doctor wild life sanctuary

975
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,447
speak of the devil

976
01:05:06,614 --> 01:05:08,575
you think you've won but you haven't

977
01:05:12,203 --> 01:05:14,330
thanks very much . That's all for today

978
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:18,543
we only have an eyewitness

979
01:05:18,626 --> 01:05:20,337
did anybody see what happened?

980
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:22,047
we got one problem

981
01:05:22,255 --> 01:05:23,923
it's a freaking weasel

982
01:05:24,132 --> 01:05:25,342
what did he do?

983
01:05:26,885 --> 01:05:30,221
weasel, the doctor is here

984
01:05:33,725 --> 01:05:35,727
did you see what happen to the bear?

985
01:05:41,149 --> 01:05:44,194
you give me your watch I'll
tell you what you need to know

986
01:05:44,569 --> 01:05:46,029
you're such a weasel

987
01:05:50,617 --> 01:05:54,037
an animal? You can't offer them evidence

988
01:05:54,329 --> 01:05:55,747
you got a better idea?

989
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:58,625
I'll stall the trial maybe we hire
a private investigator

990
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:02,462
they're going to take Acher to Mexico

991
01:06:03,254 --> 01:06:04,673
if you go on the witness stand

992
01:06:04,756 --> 01:06:06,508
Riley is going to tear you to shreds

993
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:09,219
what do I have to lose?
your reputation

994
01:06:11,012 --> 01:06:12,555
I'm not giving up these animals easy

995
01:06:16,434 --> 01:06:18,436
we admit it was a setback

996
01:06:18,603 --> 01:06:21,439
but we'd like one more week
to rehabitate the bear

997
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:34,661
what if I could prove the entire
thing is a setup?

998
01:06:36,413 --> 01:06:38,832
that'd be a very serious allegation

999
01:06:39,499 --> 01:06:41,918
do you intend to present the evidence?

1000
01:06:42,752 --> 01:06:44,921
we have an eyewitness

1001
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:47,716
can I address to the court just a minute?

1002
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:51,386
we have an eyewitness who can testify

1003
01:06:51,636 --> 01:06:54,389
he heard the gunshot and a truck
back to the area

1004
01:06:55,932 --> 01:06:57,767
is that witness here in the court?

1005
01:06:58,768 --> 01:07:03,023
it's not in the court cos he's. . .

1006
01:07:04,899 --> 01:07:06,818
he's a weasel

1007
01:07:14,325 --> 01:07:16,578
I know this seems very unreasonable

1008
01:07:16,703 --> 01:07:18,455
I can talk to animals

1009
01:07:18,621 --> 01:07:20,206
this did come forward

1010
01:07:22,459 --> 01:07:28,715
I have no problem doctor Dolittle
to question the witness

1011
01:07:29,132 --> 01:07:31,760
I'd like a brief recess so that I'll have

1012
01:07:31,843 --> 01:07:35,263
an opportunity to get a camera
to have a snapshot

1013
01:07:38,266 --> 01:07:41,686
if he needs immunity we can provide
animal protection

1014
01:07:44,272 --> 01:07:47,359
I'd not allow you to make a mockery
in my courtroom

1015
01:07:47,525 --> 01:07:49,027
the deadline has passed

1016
01:07:49,235 --> 01:07:51,821
the motion to delay is denied

1017
01:07:52,238 --> 01:07:54,157
that's a shame

1018
01:08:01,831 --> 01:08:03,750
could you tell us what the weasel
wanted to say?

1019
01:08:12,008 --> 01:08:13,468
you come to get me out?

1020
01:08:15,136 --> 01:08:16,554
what do you mean sort of?

1021
01:08:16,638 --> 01:08:18,848
I couldn't prove your story

1022
01:08:19,224 --> 01:08:21,142
they what?

1023
01:08:22,644 --> 01:08:25,438
they think you'd be too dangerous
to be set free

1024
01:08:30,318 --> 01:08:32,946
they sold you to a Mexican circus

1025
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:47,711
everything . I dragged you out and
put you through all this stuff

1026
01:08:49,754 --> 01:08:51,506
like I've ruined your life

1027
01:08:53,717 --> 01:08:55,468
you gave me a life

1028
01:08:56,094 --> 01:08:58,013
you even taught me about love

1029
01:08:58,138 --> 01:09:00,140
no one can ever take that away from me

1030
01:09:08,231 --> 01:09:09,107
mama wanted me to tell you that

1031
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:11,401
the appeal's been denied

1032
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:24,205
you're back to your show business

1033
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,209
I just want eva

1034
01:09:30,962 --> 01:09:33,089
maybe I wasn't meant to be loved

1035
01:09:34,299 --> 01:09:36,259
everybody is meant to be loved

1036
01:09:49,564 --> 01:09:50,940
since when?

1037
01:09:51,733 --> 01:09:53,693
a couple of weeks ago

1038
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:57,197
at first I was kinda fuzzy

1039
01:09:57,989 --> 01:10:02,410
now I'm really clear

1040
01:10:03,536 --> 01:10:05,246
this is what you've been keeping from us right?

1041
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:07,749
don't say anything cos I don't want to be a freak

1042
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:10,043
you're not gonna be a freak

1043
01:10:13,004 --> 01:10:14,005
when it started to happen to me

1044
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:15,507
I got scared too

1045
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:18,009
this is a good thing

1046
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:31,648
now I know what I've been missing

1047
01:10:31,815 --> 01:10:35,318
a family. I guess it's something I'll never have

1048
01:10:36,236 --> 01:10:37,987
you gotta help him

1049
01:10:38,196 --> 01:10:40,031
isn't there something that we can do?

1050
01:10:41,574 --> 01:10:43,660
not just him I mean all the animal

1051
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:46,538
so many of them

1052
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:51,626
there are so many of them

1053
01:10:57,924 --> 01:10:59,592
you guys have given up haven't you?

1054
01:11:00,427 --> 01:11:02,721
what am I gonna do, I'm 6 years old

1055
01:11:02,887 --> 01:11:04,806
I am not a young beaver no more

1056
01:11:04,931 --> 01:11:07,600
beside, we've been living
in this forest how long?

1057
01:11:07,767 --> 01:11:10,145
about 1 00 years we've been
shacking in the forest

1058
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,149
I can't do this by myself

1059
01:11:15,066 --> 01:11:16,401
you guys wanna save your home

1060
01:11:16,484 --> 01:11:17,694
you gotta help me

1061
01:11:17,777 --> 01:11:19,029
whether you'll believe it

1062
01:11:19,112 --> 01:11:21,239
you guys have untapped power

1063
01:11:26,786 --> 01:11:28,288
you got a heart of the lion

1064
01:11:28,413 --> 01:11:29,956
or just strong like an ox

1065
01:11:30,081 --> 01:11:31,332
eyes like an eagle

1066
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:33,251
movement swift like a gazette

1067
01:11:33,376 --> 01:11:35,253
or you stink like a skunk

1068
01:11:35,337 --> 01:11:37,213
sorry, I'm trying to make my point here

1069
01:11:37,339 --> 01:11:38,423
what I'm trying to say is

1070
01:11:38,548 --> 01:11:40,383
we can do this

1071
01:11:40,967 --> 01:11:42,802
just don't do it without a fight

1072
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:12,457
listen don't stall with me

1073
01:12:13,124 --> 01:12:15,335
everybody take your position

1074
01:12:26,471 --> 01:12:28,098
roll them up

1075
01:12:29,849 --> 01:12:31,643
I have never seen anything like this before

1076
01:12:32,394 --> 01:12:34,104
none of them're having milk

1077
01:12:38,024 --> 01:12:39,317
what's wrong?

1078
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:40,527
strike

1079
01:12:51,204 --> 01:12:52,747
go get the fribee

1080
01:12:57,002 --> 01:12:58,586
strike

1081
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:17,063
all the animals are working together

1082
01:13:17,188 --> 01:13:18,857
you'll be out of here in no time

1083
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:23,153
animals can't organize

1084
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:26,156
you may want to take a look at this yourself

1085
01:13:39,044 --> 01:13:41,421
maybe you should talk to Dolittle

1086
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:46,217
giving in to a bunch of beasts
lowering our life form?

1087
01:13:46,384 --> 01:13:47,469
I can take democrats

1088
01:13:47,552 --> 01:13:49,554
I can take animals

1089
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:00,315
retreat

1090
01:14:02,567 --> 01:14:04,402
organized

1091
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,423
I heard something

1092
01:14:39,229 --> 01:14:41,523
don't make any move

1093
01:15:00,875 --> 01:15:02,544
you locked the door

1094
01:15:07,382 --> 01:15:08,425
I think you should run

1095
01:15:08,508 --> 01:15:11,011
I'm an attorney. I'm not with him

1096
01:15:24,941 --> 01:15:26,735
I'm sure we can work something out

1097
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:29,779
I'm gonna call doctor Dolittle

1098
01:15:30,655 --> 01:15:33,241
no sudden move or I'm gonna bite you

1099
01:15:44,919 --> 01:15:46,963
Mr, Potter, how are you sir?

1100
01:15:47,797 --> 01:15:49,966
I'm here with a couple of your friends

1101
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:52,927
I don't think you believe animals'd organize

1102
01:15:53,845 --> 01:15:56,097
I don't know what to think anymore

1103
01:15:57,974 --> 01:16:00,769
I'll be happy to set up a meeting
with you and the animals

1104
01:16:00,935 --> 01:16:02,937
so that we can work out our problem

1105
01:16:03,313 --> 01:16:05,357
it's the only way for you to admit

1106
01:16:06,566 --> 01:16:08,610
so you won't look like an idiot

1107
01:16:09,611 --> 01:16:11,780
just call them off

1108
01:16:13,239 --> 01:16:15,116
put the raccoon on the phone

1109
01:16:15,784 --> 01:16:17,118
he wants to speak to you

1110
01:16:17,202 --> 01:16:18,453
make it short

1111
01:16:20,872 --> 01:16:22,123
I got it all under control

1112
01:16:22,207 --> 01:16:23,833
I'll call you back

1113
01:16:24,417 --> 01:16:26,628
I'm here only a mediator

1114
01:16:26,795 --> 01:16:28,838
this negotiation is between Mr Potter

1115
01:16:29,881 --> 01:16:33,551
the representatives of the local wildlife

1116
01:16:36,471 --> 01:16:38,264
this is my new proposal

1117
01:16:40,433 --> 01:16:43,186
what kind of territory we're looking at

1118
01:16:44,187 --> 01:16:45,689
only 1 2 acres here

1119
01:16:49,442 --> 01:16:50,318
they like it

1120
01:16:50,402 --> 01:16:51,653
I'll give you something you like

1121
01:16:51,736 --> 01:16:53,446
like this

1122
01:17:02,205 --> 01:17:03,957
meanwhile the strike kept rolling

1123
01:17:04,124 --> 01:17:06,418
even the pros're getting in on the act

1124
01:17:17,762 --> 01:17:20,807
no, no . we won't go

1125
01:17:22,684 --> 01:17:24,352
you try running a mile

1126
01:17:38,783 --> 01:17:41,036
I don't feel like jumping any hoops today

1127
01:17:47,292 --> 01:17:48,710
hope you'll fill in there

1128
01:18:06,686 --> 01:18:08,188
give me a bear hug

1129
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:11,691
you're not leaving here

1130
01:18:11,816 --> 01:18:13,151
until you get a bear hug

1131
01:18:13,693 --> 01:18:15,779
just a little one

1132
01:18:21,659 --> 01:18:23,495
you crushed my spine

1133
01:18:30,126 --> 01:18:31,753
drive safe now

1134
01:18:35,757 --> 01:18:37,467
are you in there?

1135
01:18:40,303 --> 01:18:42,013
I just stopped by to say hello

1136
01:18:42,597 --> 01:18:44,516
thanks for everything

1137
01:18:46,059 --> 01:18:48,353
Acher, I'm ready

1138
01:18:48,561 --> 01:18:50,271
she is in heat

1139
01:18:50,689 --> 01:18:52,774
gotta go save the species

1140
01:19:03,326 --> 01:19:04,703
it's quite a summer

1141
01:19:09,874 --> 01:19:11,376
what are you doing here?

1142
01:19:25,265 --> 01:19:27,350
Charliz and the doc were closer than ever

1143
01:19:35,108 --> 01:19:36,901
you'll blend trust me

1144
01:19:44,701 --> 01:19:47,370
look at me I'm blending again

1145
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:50,665
right you're invisible

1146
01:19:50,915 --> 01:19:52,375
good job

1147
01:19:52,584 --> 01:19:55,545
they doubt the black master is back

1148
01:19:56,087 --> 01:19:57,922
I'm king of the third world

1149
01:20:02,052 --> 01:20:05,055
but the best news of all came
the following spring

1150
01:20:13,855 --> 01:20:16,066
step, step turn kick step

1151
01:20:16,483 --> 01:20:18,860
I thought it was step kick turn step, step

1152
01:20:21,738 --> 01:20:23,198
I thought you've retired.

1153
01:20:25,116 --> 01:20:28,370
ok, from the chorus
