1
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:25,334
MASTER OF THE HOUSE

2
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:39,501
CAST:

3
00:00:39,626 --> 00:00:42,584
Victor Frandsen, Watchmaker:
Johannes Meyer

4
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:46,126
Ida, his wife: Astrid Holm
Karen, their daughter: Karin Nellemose

5
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:48,751
Alvilda Kryger, Ida's mother:
Clara Schonfeld

6
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:52,459
"Mads": Mathilde Nielsen
The Doctor: Johannes Nielsen

7
00:00:52,584 --> 00:00:54,292
<i>Mrs Hansen". Petrine Some</i>

8
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:58,959
In the countless streets of the city,
houses lie next to each other,

9
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:02,376
and in those houses
people live in layers -

10
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:06,626
like wild birds carving their nests
into the rock...

11
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:10,501
Nest above nest...

12
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:14,709
Every morning, the tens of thousands
of homes in the city awaken,

13
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:18,042
and each home is a world unto itself-

14
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:21,501
with its own struggles,

15
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:24,251
its joys and sorrows,

16
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,709
its hopes... and its heroes!

17
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:30,209
Yes, hero is precisely the right word

18
00:01:30,334 --> 00:01:33,626
for the patient wife of the house,

19
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:36,251
the valiant mother of the home -

20
00:01:36,376 --> 00:01:40,251
the one who hides her tiredness,
her sorrows, and her concerns

21
00:01:40,376 --> 00:01:42,876
behind her loving smile...

22
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:48,084
The heroine of our story is called Ida,
the "hero" is called Viktor.

23
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:32,001
Let me put it in the stove.
You mustn't ruin your hands, you know.

24
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:27,126
Where are my slippers?

25
00:05:56,417 --> 00:06:02,667
Prepare the coffee tray for Father!

26
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:23,001
You must hurry, Mother!
Father is awake!

27
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,876
Mother, will you practise my tables
with me?

28
00:07:33,376 --> 00:07:36,626
God knows how often I have said

29
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:40,667
that the coffee must be on the table

30
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:44,251
when I come in the morning!

31
00:08:10,292 --> 00:08:13,751
We must see if we can afford

32
00:08:13,876 --> 00:08:20,292
to get your other shoes back
from the cobbler's on Saturday!

33
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:46,667
Am I meant to stir it with my fingers?

34
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:07,917
Is that all the butter
you can let me have?

35
00:09:54,751 --> 00:10:01,584
Oh, you put some away out there!

36
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:36,042
Of course, it's more important
that your birds get fed!

37
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:49,834
Have you brushed my coat?

38
00:11:41,126 --> 00:11:46,209
There are two hamburgers
left over from yesterday,

39
00:11:46,334 --> 00:11:49,626
which I thought
you could have for lunch.

40
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:53,709
Would you like them hot or cold?

41
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:58,876
Cold!

42
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:13,292
So, we are having you today!

43
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:37,626
Miss Madsen had been Viktor's nanny,

44
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:41,376
and as an old friend of the family,

45
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:46,626
she came and went freely
in his and Ida's home,

46
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:51,459
where the children
simply called her Mads.

47
00:12:53,084 --> 00:13:00,501
This is a sock of Frederik's -
I certainly can't make anything out of it!

48
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:32,501
Look, I might even get a pair of mittens
out of them for Karen!

49
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:53,001
Now, what was 17 times 19?

50
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:14,417
There is Sister!

51
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:42,001
Wave nicely to Mads!

52
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:08,001
From morning to evening,

53
00:15:08,126 --> 00:15:11,251
the little housewife did not
have a moment's peace...

54
00:15:11,376 --> 00:15:15,917
the small feet were incessantly running
from the living room to the kitchen,

55
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:20,376
from the kitchen to the living room...
back and forth...

56
00:15:25,584 --> 00:15:32,417
You have to make an effort,
otherwise it's no help!

57
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:47,417
Tell Frederik to go and buy
some good apples...

58
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:51,959
Father is so fond of roast apples.

59
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:41,376
It's too heavy for you.
Go and get me some potatoes instead.

60
00:17:16,584 --> 00:17:21,667
Please think about your hands, Karen!

61
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:46,917
Whatever happened to Frederik?

62
00:18:56,917 --> 00:19:07,209
Do you think I can afford shoes
for you at that price?

63
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:18,001
Oh, there is the howler monkey!

64
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:38,209
Go and put the porridge in the tureen,

65
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:41,834
so that Father does not
have to wait for his food!

66
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:52,876
Promise me, Mads...
control yourself... for my sake!

67
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:14,626
What a lout. He is not worth
the food he gets... what a rascal!

68
00:20:57,959 --> 00:21:04,084
It's sad that you cannot even
look after the boy a bit...

69
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:08,251
What do you get up to all day long?

70
00:21:27,751 --> 00:21:32,834
Get that child to stop howling!

71
00:21:58,126 --> 00:22:02,084
I think I must have said
at least twenty times

72
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:04,959
that I do not want
a drying loft down here!

73
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:31,667
Can't I give Frederik
some dry socks to wear,

74
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:34,042
so that he won't freeze?

75
00:22:36,709 --> 00:22:41,209
Freeze? He has to freeze!

76
00:22:48,876 --> 00:22:53,376
Hands at your back!

77
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:06,459
I said good day, your honour.

78
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:05,084
Lumpy porridge... most ingenious!

79
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:48,251
Have you got cotton wool in your ears?

80
00:25:36,126 --> 00:25:41,209
Do you have to run all the time?

81
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:17,834
Go and put on the kettle for coffee!

82
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:39,042
Cold hamburgers?

83
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:44,584
I guess you couldn't be bothered
to heat them.

84
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:28,376
Why not? It all helps
to get a bit of bread down!

85
00:28:21,292 --> 00:28:25,959
Thank you, there will be
no discrimination in this house.

86
00:28:26,084 --> 00:28:28,667
Now, eat your apples yourself!

87
00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:25,917
I cannot bear to see you
mistreated in this way...

88
00:29:27,376 --> 00:29:33,042
...I will go and get your mother!

89
00:29:44,209 --> 00:29:46,959
Rascal!

90
00:29:54,459 --> 00:30:05,959
I am so glad I met you, Mrs Kryger...
I was just on my way to your house.

91
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:33,792
If only money alone would do,

92
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:39,334
then I'd certainly be
more than happy to help...

93
00:30:39,459 --> 00:30:45,584
but I do not want to pay my son-in-law
to treat my daughter decently...

94
00:30:51,126 --> 00:31:00,209
...but let's see if we old ladies cannot
bring some order into this marriage.

95
00:31:00,334 --> 00:31:07,167
After all, they do love each other.

96
00:32:19,126 --> 00:32:23,042
Look where you are going!

97
00:32:58,084 --> 00:33:05,292
I don't like that your mother
brings her own food.

98
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:11,251
If the food she gets here
is not good enough,

99
00:33:11,376 --> 00:33:14,167
she can stay away!

100
00:33:42,417 --> 00:33:47,584
Many years ago,
I gave you such a good spanking

101
00:33:47,709 --> 00:33:50,959
that I could feel it
for a long time after...

102
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:56,917
...oh, how wonderful it was...

103
00:34:06,126 --> 00:34:12,042
...I don't have the strength to give you
the spanking you deserve today,

104
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:14,667
but thank God I can still slap your face!

105
00:35:00,459 --> 00:35:06,792
If your mother and that old hag are not
out of the house by the time I come home,

106
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:12,542
it's over between the two of us...
You make your choice!

107
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:51,501
You gave me a nosebleed...

108
00:35:52,542 --> 00:35:56,834
...but you just wait, my friend.

109
00:35:56,959 --> 00:36:02,834
I assure you, you will be put
in the naughty corner!

110
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:54,292
I have done my part of the job,
now it's your turn.

111
00:37:54,417 --> 00:38:01,251
She has to be gone
by the time he gets back!

112
00:38:51,001 --> 00:38:55,251
Take a soup plate!

113
00:39:43,251 --> 00:39:51,792
You must understand
that it cannot go on this way.

114
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:09,376
Maybe I am not how I should be...
but that will change...

115
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:19,209
No, girl, the fault does not lie with you
...it lies with Viktor!

116
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:23,501
You have to get away from him,
or you will be completely destroyed!

117
00:40:39,209 --> 00:40:44,251
You all say that Viktor is evil...

118
00:40:50,501 --> 00:40:54,417
...but it's not true!

119
00:41:08,959 --> 00:41:12,667
<i>Since Viktor lost his business,</i>

120
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:17,917
he has had to struggle
with adversity and poverty...

121
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:21,876
and that has left him
embittered and hardened...

122
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:43,376
...I shared the good years with Viktor...

123
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:48,417
and I would feel like a traitor

124
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:54,542
if I failed him now
when he needs me the most!

125
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:13,667
I'd better help you
with your homework.

126
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:31,042
From "The Fall of the Tyrant"
to the bookmark?

127
00:42:47,876 --> 00:42:52,917
First of all, tell me:
WHAT IS A TYRANT?

128
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:07,917
A tyrant is a cruel man of violence

129
00:43:08,042 --> 00:43:13,917
who mistreats and oppresses
those around him...

130
00:43:35,167 --> 00:43:41,751
Now, little Ida, do you understand
that you are unwell...

131
00:43:41,876 --> 00:43:47,126
much more unwell
than you will admit.

132
00:43:54,584 --> 00:44:01,126
...you have to get away from here
...even if just for a while

133
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:06,584
...it would be the best
...also for him and the children.

134
00:44:08,542 --> 00:44:13,584
Yes, but who will mind the house?

135
00:44:17,876 --> 00:44:21,751
Will you do it, Mads?

136
00:44:25,542 --> 00:44:32,917
But promise me
not to be hard on Viktor.

137
00:44:35,459 --> 00:44:41,084
HARD! I will be hard,
but not cruel!

138
00:45:17,126 --> 00:45:22,209
Run and hail a cab!

139
00:46:46,751 --> 00:46:51,667
Here are a few pennies I have put aside
to buy Viktor a little extra

140
00:46:51,792 --> 00:46:58,167
...but he must not know
that it came from me.

141
00:48:02,209 --> 00:48:06,001
Goodbye, my boy,

142
00:48:06,126 --> 00:48:13,626
don't forget to brush your teeth,
both in the evening and the morning!

143
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:06,292
He must freeze!

144
00:50:24,126 --> 00:50:31,501
Bring in the big zinc tub.
You need a bath!

145
00:50:55,959 --> 00:51:00,417
Good night, Mads!

146
00:53:15,084 --> 00:53:17,209
Later.

147
00:53:44,542 --> 00:53:49,001
Good evening, my friend!

148
00:54:06,584 --> 00:54:11,042
Yes, that's my little tweety!

149
00:54:47,209 --> 00:54:50,501
Where is Ida?

150
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:56,459
Gone!

151
00:54:58,834 --> 00:55:03,751
That is to say, your wife is very ill

152
00:55:03,876 --> 00:55:10,251
and has gone away
in order to get well again.

153
00:55:28,126 --> 00:55:33,751
What an amusing story!

154
00:55:41,501 --> 00:55:53,501
Now people will think
I mistreated my poor wife...

155
00:55:53,626 --> 00:55:57,876
...and to punish me, I come home
to find an empty living room

156
00:55:58,001 --> 00:56:03,167
and desperately rush
to my mother-in-law,

157
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:07,917
where the two of them
are sitting and laughing at me...

158
00:56:12,542 --> 00:56:21,126
...but she will be the one
who will beg me to forgive her!

159
00:56:57,917 --> 00:57:01,834
We have to make savings now.

160
00:57:31,251 --> 00:57:35,834
How dare you speak like that!

161
00:57:35,959 --> 00:57:42,667
You have to learn to speak decently,
at least to me!

162
00:57:48,917 --> 00:57:52,792
Do you understand?

163
00:58:02,584 --> 00:58:06,459
Take that kettle away!

164
00:58:09,459 --> 00:58:13,376
- Shut up
- You fool!

165
00:59:25,626 --> 00:59:34,126
It's worst for you, since you have to pay
to have it washed again.

166
01:00:06,834 --> 01:00:11,876
Take your gear and get out of here!

167
01:00:22,376 --> 01:00:24,542
Father!

168
01:00:26,042 --> 01:00:28,167
Father!

169
01:00:49,417 --> 01:00:51,542
Beast!

170
01:00:53,626 --> 01:00:55,792
Where is Mother!

171
01:01:02,376 --> 01:01:08,001
I don't know.
All I know is that she is ill and...

172
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:15,126
...and if Mother dies,
it will be your fault!

173
01:02:25,751 --> 01:02:31,667
Father, there is something,
which Mother told me not to say to you

174
01:02:31,792 --> 01:02:36,001
...but I still think you ought to know.

175
01:03:25,834 --> 01:03:31,792
The last year Mother has stayed up
working almost every night

176
01:03:31,917 --> 01:03:36,584
just so that you could get
a thick layer of butter

177
01:03:36,709 --> 01:03:40,126
and cold meats on your bread...

178
01:04:17,001 --> 01:04:22,626
Father, where are you going?

179
01:04:33,501 --> 01:04:39,667
I'm going to your grandmother's
to get Mother!

180
01:04:57,251 --> 01:05:03,001
Yes, my lamb,
it hurts to thrash a loved one,

181
01:05:03,126 --> 01:05:10,584
but we must endure it
for your mother's sake

182
01:05:10,709 --> 01:05:14,459
...until he squeals!

183
01:05:23,542 --> 01:05:31,167
Months of suffering,
contempt and humiliation

184
01:05:31,292 --> 01:05:37,876
had marked Ida,
our valiant little wife.

185
01:05:38,001 --> 01:05:45,917
The thousand household duties
had kept her afloat,

186
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:52,334
but now that she was off the treadmill,
she broke down completely.

187
01:05:59,709 --> 01:06:05,167
If your daughter is ever
to regain her humanity,

188
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:12,292
she must get out of the city...
into the countryside to peace and quiet...

189
01:06:17,292 --> 01:06:19,751
...and of course, during that time

190
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:24,084
she must break off all connection
with her husband and home.

191
01:06:46,292 --> 01:06:53,084
Promise me, Ida,
not to let Viktor know where you are...

192
01:07:53,792 --> 01:07:57,417
If you want to listen to my advice,

193
01:07:57,542 --> 01:08:03,667
then go home now and wait patiently
for your wife to recover

194
01:08:03,792 --> 01:08:08,667
...that is the best way
you can atone for what has happened!

195
01:09:03,292 --> 01:09:09,834
The misdeeds of tyrants always
turn against them, sooner or later

196
01:09:09,959 --> 01:09:15,376
...even our "hero",
who recently wielded the whip,

197
01:09:15,501 --> 01:09:19,334
learnt to bend his back.

198
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:51,709
Good night, Mads!

199
01:10:00,209 --> 01:10:02,792
Do you know the feeling

200
01:10:02,917 --> 01:10:06,667
of suddenly standing in front
of an old teacher of yours?

201
01:10:06,792 --> 01:10:11,417
Without you noticing,
your fingers fiddle with your trouser seam,

202
01:10:11,542 --> 01:10:14,584
you stammer and flush
all the way to the hair roots.

203
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:18,584
Something similar happened
in the case of Viktor.

204
01:10:18,709 --> 01:10:22,292
A month had passed
since Mads took the reins,

205
01:10:22,417 --> 01:10:26,584
and the memory of the childhood beatings
that she gave was so deep-rooted

206
01:10:26,709 --> 01:10:30,417
that he willingly submitted
to Mads' strict discipline.

207
01:10:50,167 --> 01:10:55,792
You're a little slow
getting out of bed!

208
01:10:58,042 --> 01:11:02,501
Take the glasses for the birds with you!

209
01:12:02,792 --> 01:12:08,417
What's taking you so long?
It's taking ages!

210
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:52,501
Take the kerosene bottle out with you
and put it in the cupboard!

211
01:13:10,376 --> 01:13:16,001
There is a Mrs Hansen out there!

212
01:13:18,792 --> 01:13:25,542
Yes, it's the washerwoman.
Let her in.

213
01:13:30,167 --> 01:13:40,417
You didn't think I would stand toiling in
a rough and cold laundry room, did you?

214
01:14:42,667 --> 01:14:46,001
Bring the bucket down there!

215
01:16:53,876 --> 01:16:58,334
What does Tweety say?
...tweet!

216
01:17:00,417 --> 01:17:06,376
Father, you don't have to be ashamed
of being fond of the birds.

217
01:17:06,501 --> 01:17:12,459
Canaries are human too.
That's what Mother always said.

218
01:17:17,376 --> 01:17:21,251
Karen... sit down with me.

219
01:17:25,292 --> 01:17:29,167
Don't you miss Mother?

220
01:17:43,292 --> 01:17:48,959
Don't you know when Mother
will come home?

221
01:18:06,042 --> 01:18:14,584
Mads says it won't be before
you have been in the naughty corner!

222
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:37,667
Karen, take a teaspoon!

223
01:18:57,209 --> 01:19:02,126
Do you know what I have been
looking to get you?

224
01:19:02,251 --> 01:19:03,959
...a nice dolls' stove...

225
01:19:09,251 --> 01:19:19,501
...you will get it for your birthday!
- Will you then tell me where Mother is?

226
01:24:14,834 --> 01:24:23,376
The surprises your father needs,
I'll take care of them!

227
01:24:52,459 --> 01:25:00,959
I was asked to ask you
to take that tub up with you!

228
01:25:57,376 --> 01:26:02,126
Mads never let Viktor have
a moment's peace.

229
01:26:02,251 --> 01:26:04,959
Through his own experience

230
01:26:05,084 --> 01:26:09,376
he came to know
the exhausting life of a housewife.

231
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:18,751
I need 6 kroner
for the washerwoman!

232
01:26:21,417 --> 01:26:23,542
Are your ears blocked?

233
01:26:45,251 --> 01:26:55,501
She must have wet herself
...go and change her!

234
01:27:18,292 --> 01:27:23,292
It pleased Mads to see
the humiliation of the fallen tyrant,

235
01:27:23,417 --> 01:27:27,626
but her smile would also tremble
with compassion

236
01:27:27,751 --> 01:27:32,584
when she saw him consumed
by his longing for Ida.

237
01:31:14,001 --> 01:31:19,042
Here is some bread for the coffee!

238
01:31:58,501 --> 01:32:07,001
I cannot stand this uncertainty...

239
01:32:14,709 --> 01:32:18,667
...until Ida returns,
there is no joy for me...

240
01:32:18,792 --> 01:32:22,376
I would gladly sacrifice everything

241
01:32:22,501 --> 01:32:26,709
to see her sweet face
and to hear her voice.

242
01:32:33,709 --> 01:32:36,417
Would you?

243
01:32:47,751 --> 01:32:52,209
Wouldn't there be
a little bit of arrogance left

244
01:32:52,334 --> 01:32:55,126
that you don't want to part with?

245
01:33:14,334 --> 01:33:19,376
How stupid we men are!

246
01:33:28,792 --> 01:33:33,917
We go around thinking
we're the ones carrying the load

247
01:33:34,042 --> 01:33:37,876
because we're the ones
earning the money...

248
01:33:40,834 --> 01:33:49,917
...and in reality it's HER
who carries everything...

249
01:33:58,626 --> 01:34:04,251
...and by way of thanks
she gets rudeness from her husband!

250
01:34:45,876 --> 01:34:56,126
I have only one wish and one longing:
to be allowed to be good to Ida!

251
01:35:06,751 --> 01:35:13,542
You have to get on with Mads.
You know her conditions!

252
01:35:29,542 --> 01:35:35,167
Use the opportunity you have.
...I'll go to the kitchen meanwhile.

253
01:36:00,042 --> 01:36:05,667
Mads! There is something
I would like to speak about with you!

254
01:36:20,542 --> 01:36:25,584
Listen, Mads
...you're dropping a hairpin!

255
01:36:54,959 --> 01:37:00,626
Come here for a moment
...l want to tell you something!

256
01:37:10,126 --> 01:37:14,042
Your necktie is not straight!

257
01:38:27,167 --> 01:38:32,209
<i>Now I know where Mother is...</i>

258
01:38:39,876 --> 01:38:44,917
<i>but I will not tell!</i>

259
01:39:02,459 --> 01:39:05,209
Are you out of your mind?

260
01:39:17,876 --> 01:39:21,792
Mind the stove!

261
01:39:33,584 --> 01:39:37,167
<i>But Eriksen is the one
who is closest to my heart.</i>

262
01:39:37,292 --> 01:39:42,876
<i>He claims that I am the most
wonderful woman in the world,</i>

263
01:39:43,001 --> 01:39:47,917
<i>and he says that he loves me,
which I really...</i>

264
01:40:19,792 --> 01:40:24,251
Aren't you going to close
the stove door?

265
01:40:31,001 --> 01:40:34,876
Who is Eriksen?

266
01:40:53,001 --> 01:40:56,876
It must be a man!

267
01:41:24,084 --> 01:41:29,126
I have had enough,
I want to speak now!

268
01:41:30,917 --> 01:41:33,626
Sit down!

269
01:41:46,417 --> 01:41:50,292
You men are all the same
at the end of the day...

270
01:41:52,792 --> 01:41:55,501
stupid...

271
01:41:58,751 --> 01:42:01,459
stubborn...

272
01:42:04,292 --> 01:42:07,001
vain...

273
01:42:10,584 --> 01:42:13,334
pretentious...

274
01:42:28,209 --> 01:42:32,042
You treat your wives
in a strange way.

275
01:42:32,167 --> 01:42:35,834
In the beginning
everything is fine and dandy

276
01:42:35,959 --> 01:42:39,584
...she is your "Princess"
and God knows what...

277
01:42:40,792 --> 01:42:44,876
...later on, when she really
deserves your admiration,

278
01:42:45,001 --> 01:42:49,376
you treat her like a housemaid...

279
01:42:51,792 --> 01:42:54,917
...until one day another man appears

280
01:42:55,042 --> 01:42:59,084
and you feel that your vanity
has been offended

281
01:42:59,209 --> 01:43:03,792
- then she suddenly
becomes valuable to you again!

282
01:43:23,334 --> 01:43:28,959
Do you admit that you deserve
a good thrashing?

283
01:43:42,667 --> 01:43:50,917
...I will spare you if you go nicely
to the naughty corner.

284
01:43:51,042 --> 01:43:59,334
And if you're a good boy,
I will let you know where Ida is!

285
01:44:29,501 --> 01:44:34,542
Hands on your back!

286
01:44:47,084 --> 01:44:49,251
Hey! Hey!

287
01:45:39,167 --> 01:45:44,792
Frederik, hurry upstairs!
Mother has come!

288
01:45:52,251 --> 01:45:56,167
Who is Eriksen?

289
01:47:09,251 --> 01:47:13,876
I only know now what happiness is

290
01:47:14,001 --> 01:47:19,334
...and trust me,
I shall take good care of it now.

291
01:47:58,292 --> 01:48:03,376
But I have nice teeth!

292
01:48:31,292 --> 01:48:36,334
It's a bit of
Foodstuff...

293
01:48:48,709 --> 01:48:56,084
Now close that stove door, will you?

294
01:49:40,709 --> 01:49:42,667
OPTICIANS' SHOP
For immediate sale

295
01:49:42,792 --> 01:49:46,376
Beautiful premises
on the high road for sale

296
01:49:46,501 --> 01:49:49,251
10,000 kroner in cash
PO box 4327.

297
01:50:00,376 --> 01:50:04,292
Here is the money!

298
01:50:17,126 --> 01:50:25,626
Tell me, what's going on?
Are we going to have cold coffee?

299
01:50:28,126 --> 01:50:36,667
And once again the heart of the pendulum
beat and proclaimed the message:

300
01:50:36,792 --> 01:50:40,709
THOU SHALT HONOUR THY WIFE!

301
01:50:40,834 --> 01:50:47,584
For her strong hands are
what keeps the whole world together.

302
01:50:47,709 --> 01:50:52,292
SHE is the heart of the home.

303
01:50:59,667 --> 01:51:05,292
THE END
