1
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,436
<i>- Americano.
- Sì, americano.</i>

2
00:02:00,404 --> 00:02:02,860
<i>Ah! Pilota!</i>

3
00:04:19,387 --> 00:04:21,463
Party, inward... turn!

4
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:25,259
Party... flag!

5
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:34,143
For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God to take unto himself...

6
00:04:34,237 --> 00:04:37,440
...the soul of our dear brother here departed...

7
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:40,486
...we therefore commit his body to the ground.

8
00:04:42,455 --> 00:04:44,743
<i>Uno, due, tre!</i>

9
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,400
Detail, outward... turn!

10
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:19,734
Detail... quick march!

11
00:05:37,555 --> 00:05:41,055
Major Fincham, will you now
please dismiss your men? Please.

12
00:05:41,142 --> 00:05:45,888
- Where is your commandant?
- As I told you, Major Battaglia is indisposed.

13
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,931
His orders are to disperse
immediately after the funeral.

14
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:58,242
- Major Fincham, please.
- Get that Fascist bastard out here!

15
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:06,161
<i>Grazie.</i>

16
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:12,502
- You'd better follow me, please, Colonel.
- Thanks, pal.

17
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:26,888
What are they celebrating out there?

18
00:06:31,155 --> 00:06:33,231
<i>Signor maggiore.</i>

19
00:06:44,294 --> 00:06:49,290
Ryan, Joseph L.
United States Army Air Corps. 0718359.

20
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,797
Don't you salute senior officers
in your army, Major?

21
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,134
- Are you the official interpreter?
- Yes, sir.

22
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:04,397
- Then interpret exactly. Clear?
- Yes, sir.

23
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:15,568
And add this: No wonder Italy's
losing the war, with officers like him.

24
00:07:16,788 --> 00:07:18,864
Well?

25
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:33,048
Battaglia! Battaglia!

26
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:35,676
Battaglia! Battaglia!

27
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:39,515
Battaglia! Battaglia! Battaglia!

28
00:07:39,603 --> 00:07:42,391
Battaglia! Battaglia!

29
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:48,313
We have today buried
our commanding officer...

30
00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:50,897
...Colonel Brian David Lockart!

31
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:56,743
The purpose of this parade
is to bear witness to his death...

32
00:07:56,831 --> 00:07:59,998
...and charge the man responsible for it!

33
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:02,703
Major Battaglia!

34
00:08:03,756 --> 00:08:09,842
The Ninth Fusiliers now formally charge you
with the murder of Colonel Lockart!

35
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:13,132
Come forward and meet your accusers!

36
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,895
<i>Sì, signor maggiore.</i>

37
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:28,858
Battaglia! Battaglia!

38
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:29,980
Follow me, please.

39
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:34,489
Battaglia! Battaglia! Battaglia!

40
00:08:46,968 --> 00:08:51,465
Major Fincham, unless you dismiss
your men now, it will be out of my hands.

41
00:08:51,557 --> 00:08:55,307
- That swine hasn't the guts.
- You have left him no choice.

42
00:08:57,689 --> 00:08:59,682
You've shot one of my men!

43
00:09:00,275 --> 00:09:04,143
He's fainted, sir. It's Ransom.
One of those from hospital.

44
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:08,691
Dismiss.

45
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:14,372
Parade... dismiss!

46
00:09:18,294 --> 00:09:20,785
Captain Stein! One moment.

47
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,130
This is Colonel Ryan.
He needs your attention too.

48
00:09:33,312 --> 00:09:35,886
- American.
- Army Air Corps.

49
00:09:42,738 --> 00:09:46,571
Begging your pardon, sir.
Are we still beating them in Sicily?

50
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,781
We took Messina three days ago.

51
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:14,310
- Are you reporting for sick parade, Sergeant?
- No, sir.

52
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:17,601
I'm still trying to get
what my boys have needed all along.

53
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:21,822
I'm afraid I still have the same answer
for you: There isn't any.

54
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,742
Easy, fellas. Easy.

55
00:10:35,253 --> 00:10:37,329
Over here, Colonel.

56
00:10:45,723 --> 00:10:48,429
The stool will do.

57
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,062
- Looks like you got a full house.
- And getting fuller, I'm afraid.

58
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:56,352
- What's the matter with these men?
- Malaria, scurvy.

59
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:58,817
Made worse by malnutrition.

60
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:02,855
- I've only alcohol for a disinfectant.
- Go right ahead, Doc.

61
00:11:03,618 --> 00:11:06,654
How come you can't control
the malaria with drugs?

62
00:11:06,746 --> 00:11:09,202
The Eyeties make no mepacrine.

63
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,494
The Eyeties grow food.
Get extra rations for your sick.

64
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:14,708
And clean up some of this filth.

65
00:11:14,796 --> 00:11:17,549
And perhaps get 'em some clean uniforms.

66
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:21,417
Our diet and filth are Battaglia's
punishment for escape attempts.

67
00:11:21,512 --> 00:11:25,296
He's taken our soap and razors,
turned off our shower baths...

68
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:30,183
...issued us with no uniforms or Red Cross
parcels, and kept us on half rations.

69
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:34,221
But he can't break us,
and he can't stop us trying to escape.

70
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:36,855
Even with the way
the war is going for us now?

71
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:39,437
Are you suggesting
we should knuckle under?

72
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,316
If that's what it takes, yes.
Liberation can only be a few weeks away.

73
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,615
Did you hear the colonel's suggestion, fellas?

74
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,409
<i>What do you think?</i>

75
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:55,253
Well... meanin' no disrespect to him, sir...

76
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:59,920
...I'd say the colonel ought to muck off, sir.

77
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:06,009
I can't expect you to understand this,
but these men belong to the Ninth Fusiliers.

78
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:09,518
This regiment fought
with Mariborough in 1704...

79
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:12,772
...with Wellington against Napoleon,
and in the Crimea.

80
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:17,900
These men are all volunteers, professionals,
and they've come to fight a war.

81
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,407
It may come as news to you, Major,
but that's why we're all here.

82
00:12:22,495 --> 00:12:26,825
Yes, but each in his different way. You
ought to know that. You're a professional.

83
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:30,961
Negative. I'm what they call at home
a 90-day wonder.

84
00:12:31,046 --> 00:12:35,209
- I'm an airplane driver. My business is flying.
- Ours is soldiering.

85
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:40,593
OK, clue me. Suppose you do rig an escape.
How many men do you figure to get clear?

86
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,846
- Colonel Ryan, if one gets out, it's a victory.
- Sure it is.

87
00:12:45,979 --> 00:12:48,138
Can somebody show me where I bunk?

88
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:50,106
- Sergeant Major.
- Sir?

89
00:12:50,193 --> 00:12:52,862
- Escort Colonel Ryan to his quarters.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:55,022
We dine at six, sir.

91
00:12:56,074 --> 00:12:58,150
- Major.
- This way, Colonel.

92
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:15,963
Sergeant Bostick, sir. 113th Tank Division.

93
00:13:17,388 --> 00:13:20,342
This is Corporal Giannini, and Private Ames.

94
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:25,223
The reason we didn't say anything to you
in the sickbay, we wanted to get you alone.

95
00:13:25,313 --> 00:13:27,389
They've all gone to mess.

96
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,106
- Are you cold, son?
- It's that damn malaria.

97
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:35,523
Don't knock it, Bostick. You ever have it,
Colonel? The fever makes you dream.

98
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,866
And, man, what dreams!
You know what I mean, sir?

99
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:41,360
- No. What?
- Well, they...

100
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:45,202
Hey. He's pretty sharp, huh?

101
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,921
You're a welcome sight, sir.
We need an American officer real bad.

102
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:55,502
- How many of us are there?
- Eight. We've lost two.

103
00:13:55,596 --> 00:14:00,009
And if we don't get some decent grub and
medicine, that's gonna double and triple.

104
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:03,517
That's tough. From what I've seen,
everybody's in the same boat.

105
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:06,559
Sure, because the guys running it
are section eight.

106
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:10,564
Those stir-crazy limey officers
are trying to fight the war from in here.

107
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:14,022
They got so many tunnels dug,
you could fall into one.

108
00:14:14,115 --> 00:14:17,781
- You expect me to keep them from digging?
- You got the rank for it, sir.

109
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:23,244
Don't get us wrong, sir. Nobody's here to
defend Battaglia. He's a two-bit Mussolini.

110
00:14:23,334 --> 00:14:25,208
But if they'd let up, he would too.

111
00:14:25,294 --> 00:14:30,454
With Sicily gone, our guys will come through
Italy like shoe polish through a tin horn.

112
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:33,800
All we gotta do is get healthy,
sit tight and wait.

113
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:38,596
These people have been here for two years.
I just got here. I need time to check this out.

114
00:14:38,683 --> 00:14:43,262
Not too long. Please, sir.
Three of my boys are just about gone now.

115
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:15,218
Colonel Ryan, this is Captain Costanzo,
our regimental chaplain.

116
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:17,347
- Lieutenant Orde.
- Lieutenant.

117
00:15:17,435 --> 00:15:21,384
- Delighted, Colonel Ryan.
- Please sit down. Sorry I kept you waiting.

118
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,936
Colonel Lockart always sat here.

119
00:15:26,695 --> 00:15:28,818
I'll be fine right here. Thank you.

120
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:45,832
Major, if you don't mind talking about it,
how did your colonel buy it?

121
00:15:45,922 --> 00:15:48,413
He struck Battaglia with his stick.

122
00:15:49,134 --> 00:15:51,507
Do you see that sweatbox there?

123
00:15:52,305 --> 00:15:54,594
Colonel Lockart died in there last night.

124
00:15:54,682 --> 00:15:57,803
Which makes you
the senior officer of this camp.

125
00:15:58,979 --> 00:16:01,898
My regiment will await your orders.

126
00:16:10,241 --> 00:16:12,946
It's still your regiment, Major.

127
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:17,197
Thank you, sir.

128
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:29,129
It's made from pumpkins, you know.

129
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,925
Just a little different, don't you think?

130
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:41,523
We couldn't help noticing
where you sat, Colonel.

131
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:45,060
It took 200 years to make officers
like those. It took me 90 days.

132
00:16:45,153 --> 00:16:47,691
- They're nuts, sir.
- It's their ball game.

133
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:50,487
- We're still shut out.
- We did as good with a sergeant.

134
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,067
Now we got us a bird colonel.

135
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:57,413
A bird colonel outranks a birdbrain. Clear?

136
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:00,326
- Anything else, Sergeant?
- No, sir.

137
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:06,625
Bird is right. Chicken.

138
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:09,340
OK, OK. Now we know we're on our own.

139
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:41,796
- Do you feel up to a bit of running, sir?
- Running?

140
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:45,215
Dodging the lights, I mean.
It's pretty important.

141
00:19:01,093 --> 00:19:05,173
- What the hell is this?
- Earth, sir, from the tunnel.

142
00:19:05,264 --> 00:19:10,471
We reckon the barracks ceiling can hold
two tons of it if we spread it around right.

143
00:19:40,385 --> 00:19:44,798
Sorry to ask you to make this trip,
but I thought you ought to be here.

144
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,473
Your countrymen were caught
trying to steal supplies.

145
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:56,102
- What supplies, Major?
- Escape rations. See for yourself.

146
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,774
These men are thieves.

147
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:42,994
But since they're Americans,
I wanted your approval to punish them.

148
00:20:43,078 --> 00:20:46,577
- What's your side?
- My boys need things from those parcels, sir.

149
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:50,711
- Food. And more important, mepacrine.
- That true, Major?

150
00:20:50,795 --> 00:20:54,046
Perfectly. But these men are thieves
and should be punished.

151
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:58,796
Negative. These men are sick. You've also got
50 men in sickbay with the same disease.

152
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:02,886
- What the hell are you doing about that?
- War produces casualties, Colonel.

153
00:21:02,976 --> 00:21:05,514
Everyone in camp's been exposed to malaria.

154
00:21:05,604 --> 00:21:10,350
The only way a man has a chance of escape is
for him to have mepacrine to keep him going.

155
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:14,487
Forget the punishment, Major. Bostick,
get these men outta here. See me later.

156
00:21:14,572 --> 00:21:16,648
- My boys are sick, sir.
- Out.

157
00:21:22,204 --> 00:21:26,748
- Major, move those parcels to the sickbay.
- What did you say?

158
00:21:27,502 --> 00:21:30,171
- That's a direct order.
- Damn your direct order!

159
00:21:30,254 --> 00:21:36,257
I'm the ranking officer here. You'll deliver
those parcels tonight. Is that clear, mister?

160
00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:44,509
You'd better know what you're doing,
unless you want a mutiny on your hands.

161
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,845
Mutiny in the Ninth Fusiliers?

162
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:51,268
Wellington and Mariborough would
spin in their graves, Major, what?

163
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:06,958
321 present, 83 in hospital,
404 men present or accounted for.

164
00:22:07,044 --> 00:22:09,749
- You may dismiss.
- If you don't mind, Captain...

165
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,706
...l'm assuming command
as senior officer of the camp.

166
00:22:14,135 --> 00:22:18,085
That is, of course, between you.
I will inform Major Battaglia.

167
00:22:18,181 --> 00:22:21,716
I'd rather do that personally.
Will you take me to him?

168
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,684
Rest the men, Major, but keep them here.

169
00:22:29,151 --> 00:22:31,227
Stand at... ease!

170
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:34,438
Stand easy.

171
00:22:39,954 --> 00:22:42,445
<i>Avanti!</i>

172
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:31,587
My major warns you that he has
no patience left with the prisoners.

173
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:35,841
By taking command, you have become
personally responsible for their actions.

174
00:23:35,932 --> 00:23:37,758
Good.

175
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:43,306
And tell him that, from now on, things will be
much more different than they've been.

176
00:23:56,162 --> 00:23:58,700
You have made a good impression
on the major.

177
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:03,582
- But he warns you against trying to trick him.
- Never. Of course not.

178
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,508
Ask the major to come with me now. I'll prove
how different things'll be around this camp.

179
00:24:45,882 --> 00:24:48,124
What in heaven's name is he doing?

180
00:24:48,217 --> 00:24:50,340
What does it look like?

181
00:24:51,554 --> 00:24:53,595
Ryan!

182
00:24:53,682 --> 00:24:55,342
Ryan!

183
00:24:55,434 --> 00:24:59,729
Ryan, you can't do this.
You can't do this to anyone.

184
00:24:59,814 --> 00:25:04,441
- I'm glad you could join us, Major.
- If you betray us, you'll pay for it.

185
00:25:04,527 --> 00:25:10,067
You're just in time to watch. Have the men
turn about face so they can watch too. Major?

186
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:14,777
Sergeant Bostick, rip up that shower floor.

187
00:25:16,707 --> 00:25:21,750
Parade... about... turn!

188
00:25:38,356 --> 00:25:41,939
All right. Now hear this.

189
00:25:42,026 --> 00:25:47,899
While I'm in command, anyone attempting
to escape will be held for court martial.

190
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,992
Clear?

191
00:25:51,078 --> 00:25:53,914
Stand steady on parade!

192
00:25:54,124 --> 00:25:56,828
You'll get the Nazi Iron Cross
for this, Von Ryan!

193
00:25:57,877 --> 00:26:03,502
By order of the commandant, the showers
will be turned on at 1200 hours.

194
00:26:04,343 --> 00:26:08,293
Razors will be provided
and delousing powder issued.

195
00:26:08,806 --> 00:26:13,386
Beginning tonight, Red Cross parcels
will be distributed once a week.

196
00:26:14,438 --> 00:26:17,355
- You may dismiss the parade.
- Not so fast, Captain.

197
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:21,355
What about the clothing in the Red Cross
parcels in that storage house?

198
00:26:21,445 --> 00:26:23,983
I advise you to forget this matter.

199
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:28,901
Sure, because Battaglia's got a black market
going in Red Cross clothes. Right?

200
00:26:28,995 --> 00:26:32,779
You tell this man I trusted him
as a gentleman. I want those clothes.

201
00:26:41,884 --> 00:26:44,920
I'm sorry. The major says
he cannot issue... wine.

202
00:26:45,012 --> 00:26:49,758
Wine? Who the hell said anything
about wine? I'm talking about clothes.

203
00:26:50,894 --> 00:26:52,886
It's for your own good, Colonel.

204
00:26:54,523 --> 00:26:57,809
You let yourself be bought
pretty cheaply, didn't you?

205
00:26:57,902 --> 00:27:00,393
Louse powder and hot water? Hah!

206
00:27:01,197 --> 00:27:04,732
- Orde, dismiss the men.
- I'll tell you when to dismiss, Lieutenant.

207
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:09,119
Bostick, tear the door off that bathhouse,
and use anything else you might need.

208
00:27:09,205 --> 00:27:10,663
Right, sir.

209
00:27:11,582 --> 00:27:15,200
Major Fincham, you will give
an order for the men to strip.

210
00:27:15,294 --> 00:27:18,129
Strip. Understand? Naked.

211
00:27:28,017 --> 00:27:31,386
Parade... strip.

212
00:27:34,857 --> 00:27:38,689
Now take off all of those rags. All of them!

213
00:27:40,406 --> 00:27:43,525
And, Major, that goes for the officers as well.

214
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:50,697
Pass thatjunk from the rear to the front
of the line and throw it in the fire!

215
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:49,426
Captain Costanzo, I said strip.

216
00:28:50,315 --> 00:28:53,519
Sir, I take being
a member of the cloth literally.

217
00:28:56,907 --> 00:28:58,983
I bow to your convictions, Captain.

218
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:08,161
- Here comes II Duce!
- Attention!

219
00:29:17,345 --> 00:29:21,673
The major feels the fire
should be put out at once.

220
00:29:21,765 --> 00:29:25,015
Tell him we have no firefighting equipment.

221
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,409
- He says you are no gentleman, Colonel.
- Only by an act of Congress.

222
00:30:23,498 --> 00:30:25,575
Now what about the clothing?

223
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:39,631
The prisoners will be issued clothing,
Colonel Ryan.

224
00:30:39,723 --> 00:30:42,558
But you, sir, I'm afraid, must follow me.

225
00:30:52,903 --> 00:30:54,980
Good show, Colonel!

226
00:31:07,838 --> 00:31:11,669
Major Fincham!
You may dismiss when ready.

227
00:31:46,962 --> 00:31:52,254
We made it, Colonel. Our guys
landed at Salerno. Italy's surrendered.

228
00:31:54,262 --> 00:31:58,510
That's great. Just great.

229
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:03,761
Yeah. Our guys are ready to shove off, but
these limeys back here are giving us trouble.

230
00:32:03,856 --> 00:32:05,932
Hello, sir. Are you all right?

231
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:09,062
Could you come right away? There's trouble.

232
00:32:31,637 --> 00:32:34,341
- There are no guards.
- They bolted during the night.

233
00:32:34,431 --> 00:32:38,132
Major Fincham took Battaglia prisoner.
He's court-martialling him.

234
00:32:38,227 --> 00:32:44,431
Let the regimental records show Captain
Stein appearing as defending officer...

235
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:49,649
...Lieutenant Orde as prosecuting officer.
Major Fincham presiding.

236
00:32:50,489 --> 00:32:52,731
If the court pleases.

237
00:32:52,825 --> 00:32:57,571
- Colonel Ryan, this is no affair of yours.
- I'm still the senior officer in this camp.

238
00:32:57,664 --> 00:33:01,708
We're holding a summary court martial
exactly according to regulations.

239
00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:05,578
What happens when you find him guilty,
according to regulations?

240
00:33:05,673 --> 00:33:09,374
- He will be hanged.
- That'll be murder. He's now a civilian.

241
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:13,337
No, sir. We're still at war,
and the enemy is still the enemy.

242
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:16,385
I say hang him!

243
00:33:19,729 --> 00:33:23,313
Major, release this man.
Oriani, get him outta here.

244
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:26,271
The parade will stand at ease!

245
00:33:49,803 --> 00:33:53,588
The major begs me to say that...

246
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:55,758
...he never meant you harm.

247
00:33:55,852 --> 00:33:59,720
It was Mussolini and his Fascists
who forced him to be harsh.

248
00:34:01,984 --> 00:34:04,689
Now it's all finished for Italy.

249
00:34:05,362 --> 00:34:10,238
Let the killing be finished too.

250
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,530
You want your revenge with this?

251
00:34:15,624 --> 00:34:17,830
I wantjustice.

252
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,959
Not only for Colonel Lockart and the other
dead, but for those of us who are still alive.

253
00:34:23,048 --> 00:34:24,922
We're 200 miles behind the lines.

254
00:34:25,008 --> 00:34:30,762
I say not only military justice but military
sense dictates we cannot turn this man loose.

255
00:34:30,847 --> 00:34:33,339
- Aye!
- There's a better way, Major.

256
00:34:33,434 --> 00:34:35,760
- You all wantjustice?
-  Yes!

257
00:34:35,854 --> 00:34:39,389
Then do to him what he did to your colonel.
Put him in a sweatbox to rot.

258
00:34:39,483 --> 00:34:41,559
- No!
- Yes!

259
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:11,765
You fool.

260
00:35:11,851 --> 00:35:15,800
- You soft-headed, sentimental fool.
- That's privilege of rank, Major.

261
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:21,271
Damn your rank. If letting that scum live
costs the life of one of my men, I promise...

262
00:35:26,034 --> 00:35:28,489
Scatter! Hit the deck! Hit the deck!

263
00:35:44,846 --> 00:35:47,302
He pinpointed us. We'd better move quick.

264
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:50,842
- Brilliant, Colonel. Where?
- We're a day's march from the coast.

265
00:35:50,935 --> 00:35:54,304
- I could contact your navy.
- Move 400 men in daylight? You're mad.

266
00:35:54,397 --> 00:35:56,271
- I'll lead you.
- Why should you?

267
00:35:56,358 --> 00:35:58,684
You think you hate the Germans
more than I do?

268
00:35:58,778 --> 00:36:01,317
- It's worth a chance.
- I don't trust the Eyeties.

269
00:36:01,406 --> 00:36:04,527
But I'm in command here
and I say we move - now.

270
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,527
Halt!

271
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,614
German convoy! Everybody down!

272
00:37:19,073 --> 00:37:21,280
Those ruins could hide a thousand men.

273
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:25,946
Let them rest there for the night
while I go ahead and contact the ships.

274
00:37:26,497 --> 00:37:28,786
How much farther to the coast?

275
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:32,743
Five... perhaps six miles.
I should be back well before dawn.

276
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:36,836
That's as pretty a place for a trap
as I've ever seen.

277
00:37:36,925 --> 00:37:40,674
Good luck, Oriani. We'll be
waiting for you. Now let's go.

278
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:00,170
<i>Kamerad.</i>

279
00:40:21,395 --> 00:40:23,471
Face it, Yank.

280
00:40:23,564 --> 00:40:26,933
Your little Eyetie chum has deserted us.

281
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:29,314
We're left in a box.

282
00:40:29,403 --> 00:40:31,480
Colonel!

283
00:40:33,032 --> 00:40:35,108
Something's moving!

284
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:36,743
Out! Out!

285
00:40:36,828 --> 00:40:39,283
Germans! Scatter!

286
00:40:39,372 --> 00:40:42,373
Scatter! Scatter! Come on!

287
00:42:04,381 --> 00:42:06,457
OK. Now.

288
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,502
Hold it. Hold it!

289
00:42:25,154 --> 00:42:30,113
Colonel Ryan, Major Fincham, Captain Stein
and Costanzo, Lieutenant Orde - the front car.

290
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:32,324
I'm a doctor. I stay with the wounded.

291
00:42:32,412 --> 00:42:37,620
They will remain behind so we can care
for them properly. Get aboard, gentlemen.

292
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:46,301
That little Eyetie bastard Oriani
led us to the railhead and turned us in.

293
00:43:02,195 --> 00:43:04,733
It was that pig who betrayed us!

294
00:43:05,114 --> 00:43:07,189
I'll kill you!

295
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:19,545
They've cared for our wounded properly now.
The poor bastards.

296
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:22,169
Just cos you let Battaglia live!

297
00:43:22,258 --> 00:43:25,758
You'll get your Iron Cross now, Von Ryan.

298
00:44:21,155 --> 00:44:25,901
Hey, the roads are full of Germans.
It means we must still be headed north.

299
00:44:35,963 --> 00:44:40,257
You can bet on it, Yank. Von Ryan's
got us all a one-way ticket to the Fatherland.

300
00:44:40,342 --> 00:44:43,629
- Yeah!
- Aw, blow it out your barracks bag, mate.

301
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,427
Listen, I'll take you on any time you like!

302
00:46:04,435 --> 00:46:06,511
We are coming in to Rome.

303
00:47:29,025 --> 00:47:32,940
I am Major von Klement,
now in command of this prison train.

304
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:37,445
You will be in my charge
until we reach the final destination.

305
00:47:37,534 --> 00:47:42,112
You have now 30 minutes for rest, relief,
and there is food and water for all.

306
00:47:42,956 --> 00:47:44,913
Major von Klement?

307
00:47:46,293 --> 00:47:52,046
Captain Oriani is an Italian officer. He's not
a prisoner of war. He doesn't belong with us.

308
00:47:52,132 --> 00:47:55,797
I have my orders.

309
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:57,320
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

310
00:49:12,011 --> 00:49:14,502
The guards are on top again.

311
00:49:14,597 --> 00:49:17,764
They're not needed here
as far as we're concerned.

312
00:49:18,851 --> 00:49:22,635
<i>No chance of our tunnelling
through this coop, Von Ryan.</i>

313
00:50:03,274 --> 00:50:07,652
Say, Doc, you got a knife
in that manicuring kit of yours?

314
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:31,012
Are you planning
to snip your way through it?

315
00:50:31,096 --> 00:50:32,923
No.

316
00:50:33,015 --> 00:50:35,636
<i>I'm planning to tunnel my way through it.</i>

317
00:50:50,242 --> 00:50:52,318
Do you mind, Major?

318
00:51:07,512 --> 00:51:12,304
No, no, Colonel, wait. Wait until...
until the wheels hit cross tracks.

319
00:51:12,392 --> 00:51:15,144
It will cover the sound of the wood breaking.

320
00:52:08,996 --> 00:52:11,831
It's impossible to get out
while we are moving.

321
00:52:11,916 --> 00:52:16,493
- And when we stop, the guards will patrol.
- If it's dark when we stop, I'll risk it.

322
00:52:16,586 --> 00:52:21,414
- What about the rest? If one goes, we all go.
- Do we, now? Mind telling me how?

323
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:24,212
- We'll have to eliminate the guards.
- Brilliant!

324
00:52:24,302 --> 00:52:28,170
They have machine pistols
and we have bare hands.

325
00:52:44,074 --> 00:52:46,910
If we could take one gun from one guard...

326
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:11,261
Oriani?

327
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,688
Turn around.

328
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,850
Go on. Just turn around.

329
00:53:22,701 --> 00:53:25,820
Learn that from the cowboy films, did you?

330
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,532
You got a better idea?

331
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:33,158
It would take you too long
to strangle a man, Colonel Ryan.

332
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:37,202
The average Nazi would get impatient
while you were doing it.

333
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:39,375
Orde.

334
00:53:46,516 --> 00:53:50,894
The knots smash his larynx, the knee
breaks his back. He's dead in 15 seconds.

335
00:53:50,979 --> 00:53:52,936
Thug garrotte - India.

336
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,645
All right, then. Now what's your scheme?

337
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:00,908
If you haven't the guts for it, I'll do it.

338
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:03,094
We're stopping again.

339
00:57:04,147 --> 00:57:06,270
Something must have gone wrong.

340
00:57:06,357 --> 00:57:09,524
- Perhaps they've been caught.
- Take it easy, Padre.

341
00:58:05,754 --> 00:58:07,664
- There's a station up ahead.
- Wait.

342
00:58:07,757 --> 00:58:10,674
- Someone might be watching.
- It's a chance we'll take.

343
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,678
The guards are on this side.
Open the door on that side.

344
00:58:13,764 --> 00:58:16,302
- What kind of insanity...
- Knock it off.

345
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:19,096
- Get the men on the roof right away.
- Right, sir.

346
00:58:19,478 --> 00:58:22,349
If you fail, the Germans
won't have to kill you. I will.

347
00:58:22,439 --> 00:58:23,850
Shut up.

348
00:58:36,123 --> 00:58:38,199
Shh. Shh.

349
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:45,631
Bostick, you follow me with half the men.
Dunbar, spread out with the rest. Move. Quiet.

350
01:00:01,382 --> 01:00:03,255
Let's turn 'em loose.

351
01:00:16,732 --> 01:00:20,065
- Can we get moving?
- The engineer's alive but not the fireman.

352
01:00:20,151 --> 01:00:23,687
- I can stoke the boiler, sir.
- Get Oriani up with the engineer.

353
01:00:23,781 --> 01:00:28,360
- Send the chaplain and the doctor here.
- Yes, sir. Get those bodies in the boxcar!

354
01:00:28,452 --> 01:00:30,529
Get this stiff in the boxcar.

355
01:00:30,622 --> 01:00:32,615
Get those bods in quick!

356
01:00:55,398 --> 01:00:57,474
Move, you people! Come on, move!

357
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:24,043
Ten more minutes... Of all the luck!

358
01:01:25,057 --> 01:01:31,592
He'll have to stop for water, same as we did.
By the time he gets goin' we'll be miles away.

359
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:44,236
Damn thing's right behind us.

360
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,697
Can you bring him around? We'll need him.

361
01:02:09,354 --> 01:02:11,430
Come on. Come on!

362
01:02:17,947 --> 01:02:19,987
All the comforts of home.

363
01:02:20,074 --> 01:02:23,324
Please. I am Italian.
I have done nothing. Please.

364
01:02:24,704 --> 01:02:29,282
- What on earth are you doing here, my child?
- Padre, you're priceless.

365
01:02:30,919 --> 01:02:34,086
Don't you think she ought to
get dressed while we discuss it?

366
01:02:34,173 --> 01:02:37,043
He's right. Go on, girl. No one will hurt you.

367
01:02:39,511 --> 01:02:41,467
Now, about some questions, Major.

368
01:02:41,554 --> 01:02:43,630
- May I rise?
- Of course.

369
01:02:44,724 --> 01:02:47,345
<i>I will answer no questions, Herr Oberst.</i>

370
01:02:48,686 --> 01:02:53,514
Major... All your guards are dead.
We're running this train now.

371
01:02:53,608 --> 01:02:59,030
I want the schedule of when and where we're
gonna get that food you promised us. Clear?

372
01:03:05,663 --> 01:03:09,246
- Florence at 0600 hours.
- And what happens in Florence?

373
01:03:09,334 --> 01:03:13,202
The train will stop in the rail complex
and the prisoners can dismount.

374
01:03:13,297 --> 01:03:15,789
Colonel Ryan! Colonel, look!

375
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:22,422
Looks like we're headed for Innsbruck.

376
01:03:22,516 --> 01:03:24,674
What do these circles mean, Major?

377
01:03:24,768 --> 01:03:30,605
I am to receive instructions in those cities
from the dispatchers. I, myself. No one else.

378
01:03:30,691 --> 01:03:34,060
Did you receive those instructions
through that radio there?

379
01:03:34,153 --> 01:03:37,688
- No. It is a simple commercial radio.
- All right. Over there.

380
01:03:37,782 --> 01:03:40,652
Lieutenant, if he wiggles, put a hole in him.

381
01:03:50,002 --> 01:03:54,545
- They're keeping pace with us.
- A German troop train is on this schedule.

382
01:03:54,632 --> 01:03:58,678
Gentlemen, you have been very daring.
Yet what have you gained?

383
01:03:58,762 --> 01:04:01,882
In Florence, other troops are waiting.
You have been brave.

384
01:04:01,974 --> 01:04:06,638
If you now wish to be sensible, I will see
that you are treated with respect in Florence.

385
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:10,064
We had a sample of your Nazi respect
when we boarded this train.

386
01:04:10,151 --> 01:04:14,444
- Still, you have no choice.
- And nothing to lose by trying to make one.

387
01:04:19,243 --> 01:04:24,784
Von Klement's identification papers and
railroad priority, good as far as Florence.

388
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:28,208
- You do very well with German, Padre.
- I studied in Germany.

389
01:04:28,295 --> 01:04:30,501
I went to Breslau after Oxford.

390
01:04:30,589 --> 01:04:34,123
Would the dispatcher in Florence
recognise the major by sight?

391
01:04:36,136 --> 01:04:40,300
- He'd be an Italian, wouldn't he?
- Of course! Under German supervision.

392
01:04:40,391 --> 01:04:44,224
- And I think you're lying.
- I'd say, with the country in such a flap...

393
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:48,975
...the chances that the dispatcher
will ask for identification is pretty small.

394
01:04:49,068 --> 01:04:52,649
Will ask whom? I mean,
you just said just now...

395
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:58,776
- Yes. It'll just have to be the chance we take.
- You are extremely foolish!

396
01:04:58,868 --> 01:05:01,989
- Quite right.
- Oh, no. But I...

397
01:05:02,873 --> 01:05:07,583
But... look at this picture!
I don't look remotely like this chap.

398
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:10,244
No, no. I won't do it.

399
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,416
I won't do it. Absolutely not.

400
01:05:13,176 --> 01:05:16,379
<i>- Heil Hitler!
- That's better. Now let's see you walk.</i>

401
01:05:16,471 --> 01:05:19,639
- It won't work, you know.
- Yes, it will. Let's see you walk.

402
01:05:19,725 --> 01:05:23,142
Put some style into it. Hand on your hip.
The Boche have style.

403
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:25,637
Slap your gloves against your leg.

404
01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:35,366
<i>- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler.</i>

405
01:05:35,451 --> 01:05:37,444
<i>Gut. Sehr gut.</i>

406
01:05:37,537 --> 01:05:40,241
I think you had him goin' there, vicar.
You all set?

407
01:05:40,331 --> 01:05:45,408
Yes, sir. I came over the tops of the cars to
check. 14 of our guys are stationed as guards.

408
01:05:45,503 --> 01:05:48,076
The rest of the uniforms were too bloody.

409
01:05:48,172 --> 01:05:52,550
- Did you get rid of the bodies?
- While we were passing over the last bridge.

410
01:07:36,916 --> 01:07:41,330
The lieutenant wants our men down
from the top of the train, to be fed first.

411
01:07:41,422 --> 01:07:44,423
If they get down, we're dead.
They can't speak German.

412
01:07:44,508 --> 01:07:46,584
We've had it.

413
01:07:55,477 --> 01:07:57,636
Crikey! Ain't that our vicar?

414
01:08:59,005 --> 01:09:01,081
Better check our lovebirds.

415
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:59,018
<i>- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.</i>

416
01:10:47,497 --> 01:10:49,573
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

417
01:10:50,208 --> 01:10:52,081
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

418
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:17,565
- Here they come!
- My God, they've done it!

419
01:11:18,197 --> 01:11:21,862
Well done, Padre. You've done it.
My God, you've done it.

420
01:11:28,499 --> 01:11:31,370
Believe it or not, the poor devil's fainted.

421
01:12:02,243 --> 01:12:05,328
They must be moving
a couple of divisions south.

422
01:12:05,413 --> 01:12:08,248
From the map, we'll be away
from the main roads by dark.

423
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:10,244
The men could be gone in ten minutes.

424
01:12:10,337 --> 01:12:13,871
How do we get ten minutes
with that troop train only five behind us?

425
01:12:13,965 --> 01:12:17,833
- It could turn off at Bologna.
- Or follow us straight to Berlin.

426
01:12:17,928 --> 01:12:22,221
Escaped? We haven't escaped.
All we're doing is this bastard's job for him.

427
01:12:22,307 --> 01:12:29,057
Exactly. And in Verona, which is marked by
an X on the map, I will be properly grateful.

428
01:12:29,148 --> 01:12:33,313
At Verona, both the train crew and
guard detail is scheduled to be changed.

429
01:12:33,403 --> 01:12:35,811
That's if we go to Verona.

430
01:12:35,906 --> 01:12:37,733
Look here.

431
01:12:37,825 --> 01:12:40,316
Suppose, when we get to Bologna, we...

432
01:12:41,245 --> 01:12:44,115
...we could pass it and go
to the left into Milano.

433
01:12:44,206 --> 01:12:48,869
And you go, hm?
Perhaps on American railroads, yes?

434
01:12:48,962 --> 01:12:53,339
But this train is under the orders
of the German high command.

435
01:12:53,424 --> 01:12:57,172
Such things are not possible.
To reroute a military train...

436
01:12:57,261 --> 01:13:02,802
...requires a written order signed by
a member of the general staff, Colonel.

437
01:13:02,892 --> 01:13:07,104
Major, yours is not the only army
that works in triplicate forms.

438
01:13:10,901 --> 01:13:14,566
Obergruppenführer Wilhelm von Kleist.

439
01:13:16,408 --> 01:13:19,325
- Does that mean general staff?
- It does indeed.

440
01:13:19,411 --> 01:13:24,323
Well, now. We've got a pad full of blank forms
and we've got a typewriter.

441
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:29,706
- I say! Wizard!
- We can't be any worse off than we are now.

442
01:13:29,797 --> 01:13:31,706
Quite.

443
01:13:31,799 --> 01:13:35,417
Let's say we type an order to Klement here.

444
01:13:36,429 --> 01:13:39,550
Upon arriving in Bologna,
he's told to go to Milan...

445
01:13:39,641 --> 01:13:44,932
...where he is given confidential
instructions from Gruppenführer...

446
01:13:45,022 --> 01:13:50,016
- Give me a good Aryan name.
- Um... Ottfried. Johann Heinrich.

447
01:13:50,110 --> 01:13:54,488
Gruppenführer Heinrich, who is in charge
of a trainload of sealed boxcars...

448
01:13:54,574 --> 01:13:58,740
...to be delivered to somebody...
big, important.

449
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:01,701
<i>- Fatso Goering.
- Der dicke Hermann. Brilliant!</i>

450
01:14:01,792 --> 01:14:04,282
<i>- Loot for the Reichsmarschall.
- Major?</i>

451
01:14:04,376 --> 01:14:08,374
It might do. It's got enough nerve -
I'll give you that.

452
01:14:08,464 --> 01:14:12,926
And we have it signed by our good friend
from general staff, Wilhelm von Kleist.

453
01:15:09,073 --> 01:15:12,822
<i>- Amerikanisch, nicht?
- Ja.</i>

454
01:15:44,236 --> 01:15:46,941
<i>Hauptmann Joseph Sonneberg, Herr Major.</i>

455
01:15:49,492 --> 01:15:51,365
<i>Danke sehr.</i>

456
01:15:51,452 --> 01:15:53,528
<i>- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.</i>

457
01:16:14,395 --> 01:16:16,471
Give this to the engineer.

458
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:19,015
Gestapo.

459
01:16:21,235 --> 01:16:25,778
- How long is it now?
- Ten minutes, and my pulse is up 12 points.

460
01:16:32,121 --> 01:16:34,197
- How'd it go?
- Piece of cake.

461
01:16:35,332 --> 01:16:37,408
Leave it. Everybody stay low.

462
01:16:39,754 --> 01:16:42,376
Gestapo. Get those blinds up.

463
01:16:46,845 --> 01:16:48,921
<i>Gestapo.</i>

464
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:08,761
<i>Nylon.</i>

465
01:18:33,962 --> 01:18:36,038
<i>Amerikanische Zigaretten.</i>

466
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:45,422
<i>Ja.</i>

467
01:18:56,026 --> 01:18:59,360
That chap ought to be
reported to his superiors.

468
01:19:21,554 --> 01:19:23,630
That's the end of ruddy that.

469
01:19:25,099 --> 01:19:27,175
<i>Colonnello.</i>

470
01:19:28,353 --> 01:19:30,511
- We have found it.
- Found what?

471
01:19:30,605 --> 01:19:35,599
We have found a place to leave the train.
An abandoned branch line halfway to Milano.

472
01:19:35,693 --> 01:19:37,901
Come on. Let's have a look.

473
01:19:44,621 --> 01:19:46,696
Looks to be about...

474
01:19:47,665 --> 01:19:49,741
...90 miles.

475
01:19:50,584 --> 01:19:54,249
- We'll get there by 2100 hours.
- Add half an hour, to stop for water.

476
01:19:54,338 --> 01:20:00,093
- That's better still. It'll be good and dark.
- By morning, 90% of your men will be dead.

477
01:20:00,178 --> 01:20:04,472
We don't need him any more. Or her either.

478
01:20:04,557 --> 01:20:08,341
Don't flinch. If you haven't
the stomach for it, it'll be my pleasure.

479
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:10,595
- I'll decide that.
- Like with Battaglia?

480
01:20:10,689 --> 01:20:12,683
- That was different.
- I intend it to be.

481
01:20:12,776 --> 01:20:15,481
- You'll take your orders, Major!
- I'm afraid not.

482
01:20:15,571 --> 01:20:19,070
- For God's sake! These are people!
- People don't shoot wounded!

483
01:20:19,157 --> 01:20:22,941
But they do commit murder in cold blood?
Are you that far gone?

484
01:20:23,036 --> 01:20:25,409
May I go to my compartment now?

485
01:20:25,498 --> 01:20:27,574
Yes, of course.

486
01:20:44,476 --> 01:20:47,477
You haven't had any food
since we took over the train.

487
01:20:47,563 --> 01:20:51,727
- I'm not hungry.
- Of course you are. Here, take it. Relax.

488
01:20:55,946 --> 01:21:01,071
You cannot hide it. I know you will do
what the British major wants.

489
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,034
You mean to kill you both?

490
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:07,333
It is the right thing.
In your place, I would do it.

491
01:21:08,001 --> 01:21:10,754
No, you wouldn't. You're not that tough.

492
01:21:10,838 --> 01:21:13,544
- Then what do you want?
- Nothing.

493
01:21:15,219 --> 01:21:17,295
Not to help me?

494
01:21:18,889 --> 01:21:20,965
If I can, yes.

495
01:21:21,725 --> 01:21:23,801
That is what all men say.

496
01:21:25,855 --> 01:21:27,433
How old are you?

497
01:21:27,524 --> 01:21:30,894
The first was the same man
who helped my mother.

498
01:21:31,946 --> 01:21:34,022
I was not yet confirmed then.

499
01:21:37,034 --> 01:21:40,154
Such things do not happen in America?

500
01:21:42,374 --> 01:21:47,415
- Why are you with this German?
- For food, for clothing. To stay alive.

501
01:21:48,797 --> 01:21:51,289
- Is that all?
- There is a war, you know.

502
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,551
Yeah.

503
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:07,766
How did you say it?

504
01:22:08,651 --> 01:22:10,727
Relax?

505
01:22:37,684 --> 01:22:40,175
You think my legs are too thin?

506
01:22:44,107 --> 01:22:46,681
Why don't you close the door?

507
01:22:49,863 --> 01:22:52,188
I will.

508
01:22:52,282 --> 01:22:54,359
On the way out.

509
01:23:43,337 --> 01:23:48,581
-  We need water! We're hungry too!
- Knock it off in there!

510
01:23:48,677 --> 01:23:52,971
- If they knew what was going on, they would.
- They'll just have to sweat it out.

511
01:24:48,533 --> 01:24:51,024
What the hell are we waiting for now?

512
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:56,328
Come on!

513
01:25:11,307 --> 01:25:13,384
They're gone. They're not here.

514
01:25:14,978 --> 01:25:17,055
He's dead.

515
01:25:20,944 --> 01:25:23,649
Back! Back! Get up on top!

516
01:25:23,738 --> 01:25:28,946
- We can't leave them behind to talk.
- Cover that side. Work up toward the engine.

517
01:26:16,796 --> 01:26:18,872
Get back!

518
01:26:19,549 --> 01:26:21,625
All right. Let's move.

519
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,254
Get this train moving now!

520
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:27,259
Don't run away!

521
01:27:09,018 --> 01:27:12,138
Get your hands off me
or I'll blow your head off!

522
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:07,661
These tracks have quite a shine
for not having been used.

523
01:30:07,752 --> 01:30:10,622
Something's been running on this spur.

524
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:45,955
These tracks have been used recently.
But we don't know what's ahead.

525
01:30:46,044 --> 01:30:48,535
It's deserted here. Let's get cracking.

526
01:30:48,630 --> 01:30:52,414
- Last stop, Colonel?
- Last stop, soldier. Everybody out.

527
01:31:02,979 --> 01:31:05,055
All cars unload!

528
01:31:12,155 --> 01:31:14,860
- Those are not German planes.
- American?

529
01:31:14,950 --> 01:31:18,154
No. British. Lancaster, I think.

530
01:31:18,246 --> 01:31:21,912
Sorry to turn you out in the middle
of nowhere, but it can't be helped.

531
01:31:22,001 --> 01:31:24,242
Now, head for the mountains or the sea.

532
01:31:24,336 --> 01:31:28,832
We'll form up again and have another crack
at Jerry. Off you go, lads. Good luck.

533
01:31:37,184 --> 01:31:40,054
Everybody back on the train!
Back on the train!

534
01:31:45,942 --> 01:31:48,018
Get back! Get back on the train!

535
01:31:48,737 --> 01:31:50,979
Come on, move! Back! Get in!

536
01:31:51,073 --> 01:31:52,532
Come on, move! Back!

537
01:31:52,617 --> 01:31:54,444
Oriani!

538
01:31:54,536 --> 01:31:58,700
Take this train outta here! Go! Go! Come on!

539
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:12,380
Let the coward go!

540
01:33:09,950 --> 01:33:13,568
Stop the train!

541
01:33:45,781 --> 01:33:47,773
Bostick! Bostick!

542
01:33:47,866 --> 01:33:52,362
- Injured to the lounge car!
- Tell Oriani to cut the burning cars loose!

543
01:34:06,804 --> 01:34:10,422
- Where's Oriani? We're ready to roll.
- Roll? Roll where?

544
01:34:12,893 --> 01:34:18,482
Three dead, and the rest need better help than
I can give 'em. Maybe it's the end of the line.

545
01:34:18,567 --> 01:34:21,023
<i>Colonnello.</i>

546
01:34:21,112 --> 01:34:23,733
This man thinks he can get us through.

547
01:34:23,823 --> 01:34:27,607
- What are you talking about?
- Switzerland. The whole train. All of us.

548
01:34:27,701 --> 01:34:31,035
- Switzerland?
- You're mad. You're all raving mad.

549
01:34:31,872 --> 01:34:35,408
Here. North of Milano, where the track forks.

550
01:34:36,294 --> 01:34:39,295
Since the war, all traffic
goes right, into Germany.

551
01:34:39,381 --> 01:34:43,128
But the left fork, the old Maloja Pass
route, goes to Switzerland.

552
01:34:43,217 --> 01:34:46,468
In a matter of hours
we could be over the border and free.

553
01:34:46,555 --> 01:34:51,218
- You know, it's possible.
- Yeah, maybe, but... Milano - that's the key.

554
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:55,807
- You think we can fool 'em again?
- The engineer says there is a way.

555
01:34:55,898 --> 01:35:00,774
On the outskirts of Milano is a control tower
at the beginning of the traffic complex.

556
01:35:00,862 --> 01:35:03,898
This tower controls the whole Milano area.

557
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:08,451
If we can capture it and smash the signals,
the main station, here...

558
01:35:08,537 --> 01:35:12,866
...will not know where we are until
they repair it, but by then it will be too late.

559
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:15,330
We can go through Milano without stopping?

560
01:35:15,419 --> 01:35:17,911
Yes. The engineer says it can be done.

561
01:35:19,466 --> 01:35:21,542
Let's move.

562
01:37:33,069 --> 01:37:35,145
Come on! Come on!

563
01:37:35,946 --> 01:37:38,023
Let's go!

564
01:38:45,981 --> 01:38:50,643
Soon we cross back into the complex. If the
power is back on, we will show on the board.

565
01:38:50,736 --> 01:38:55,279
By then it will be full speed.
Too late for anyone to stop us.

566
01:39:51,134 --> 01:39:55,762
- Can't this damn thing go any faster?
- Not before we reach the top of the pass.

567
01:39:55,848 --> 01:39:59,383
From there it's downgrade
all the way to Switzerland.

568
01:39:59,477 --> 01:40:03,095
Shouldn't we go a bit slower?
If they've blocked the line ahead...

569
01:40:03,189 --> 01:40:07,483
Keep it wide open. Let's move it.

570
01:40:07,569 --> 01:40:09,645
Ryan.

571
01:40:10,154 --> 01:40:13,904
- Whether we make it or not...
- We're gonna make it, Major.

572
01:40:14,952 --> 01:40:18,998
What I'm trying to say is
I'm sorry it had to be you with the girl.

573
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:49,146
- Hey, mate, look! The Alps!
- We made it!

574
01:40:54,369 --> 01:40:59,993
Now that we're over the hump, sir, Major
Fincham, I figured you'd want your stuff too.

575
01:41:01,543 --> 01:41:03,251
Pepino! Pepino!

576
01:42:34,269 --> 01:42:36,678
Messerschmitt!

577
01:42:47,867 --> 01:42:50,572
He's trying to blow the engine.

578
01:42:52,914 --> 01:42:54,991
Here comes his chum.

579
01:43:15,146 --> 01:43:17,103
There's another one!

580
01:44:53,629 --> 01:44:55,123
Oriani!

581
01:44:55,214 --> 01:44:58,084
OK, let's go.

582
01:44:59,385 --> 01:45:02,836
What the hell's he saying?

583
01:45:04,348 --> 01:45:10,303
That footbridge leads around the mountain!
It's shorter than the tunnel to the other side.

584
01:45:10,395 --> 01:45:15,307
- Fincham, get them moving on the catwalk.
- Follow me! Everybody follow me!

585
01:45:28,290 --> 01:45:30,083
Move it! Move it!

586
01:45:50,022 --> 01:45:53,606
- Come on, lads! Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

587
01:46:12,630 --> 01:46:15,548
All right. Back! Back to the trestle!

588
01:46:17,135 --> 01:46:18,713
Back!

589
01:46:27,438 --> 01:46:31,104
Looks like they're takin' off.
Let's see those glasses.

590
01:46:33,862 --> 01:46:37,313
No wonder they're takin' off. Let's go.

591
01:46:45,999 --> 01:46:48,705
What about the German
troop train back there?

592
01:46:48,795 --> 01:46:51,286
- We have guns. We will stop them.
- Then what?

593
01:46:51,381 --> 01:46:55,330
- He says we can replace the damaged track.
- Replace it with what?

594
01:46:55,426 --> 01:46:59,128
It's simple. Remove track
from behind the train - put it here.

595
01:46:59,223 --> 01:47:04,847
Well, then let's get the troop train!
All those with Schmeissers, follow me!

596
01:47:37,304 --> 01:47:40,758
This one's much too long.
Take that one there. Hurry up.

597
01:47:43,105 --> 01:47:45,810
Clear this off! Clear this off! Hurry!

598
01:47:47,526 --> 01:47:49,186
Pull! Pull!

599
01:48:00,665 --> 01:48:02,741
Come on, hurry!

600
01:48:19,352 --> 01:48:21,429
Come on, quick! That'll do it!

601
01:48:22,565 --> 01:48:23,596
Move it!

602
01:48:27,361 --> 01:48:29,187
Come on!

603
01:49:28,803 --> 01:49:31,590
It didn't work! Back! Back!

604
01:49:33,433 --> 01:49:35,508
Get back! Back!

605
01:50:34,958 --> 01:50:35,989
Fire!

606
01:50:43,259 --> 01:50:46,377
Come on, come on! Get it up!
Come on, hurry!

607
01:50:55,979 --> 01:50:58,056
Let's pull back! Back!

608
01:51:27,764 --> 01:51:30,302
Watch it! Over here! Stop!

609
01:51:59,964 --> 01:52:02,455
Keep down! Hold your fire!

610
01:52:09,851 --> 01:52:11,049
Fire!

611
01:52:28,205 --> 01:52:30,826
Cease firing! Fall back!

612
01:52:47,518 --> 01:52:50,887
- They'll try to outflank us now, huh?
- If they haven't already.

613
01:52:50,980 --> 01:52:55,108
- Give me those grenades. I'll take some men.
- No. You're needed here.

614
01:53:01,281 --> 01:53:04,366
Bostick, come with me.

615
01:53:23,182 --> 01:53:25,470
Run!

616
01:54:11,607 --> 01:54:13,481
Grenade!

617
01:54:34,049 --> 01:54:36,125
Back!

618
01:54:51,652 --> 01:54:53,277
There they are!

619
01:54:58,617 --> 01:55:00,361
Come on, Ryan!

620
01:55:03,706 --> 01:55:06,197
Come on, Major! Give me your hand!

621
01:55:10,797 --> 01:55:12,873
Hurry!

622
01:55:12,966 --> 01:55:15,172
Come on! Faster!

623
01:55:52,884 --> 01:55:57,842
<i> I once told you, Ryan,
if only one gets out, it's a victory.</i>
